Required Modules:

VUser::Email::Postfix::SQL requires the following Perl modules that are not included with Perl:
- VUser::Email::Postfix
- VUser::ExtLib::SQL

Other vuser extensions may require other Perl modules. Please see the
documentation included with those extensions for additional requirements.

Basic Installation:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install

That will install vuser on your system in /usr (or /usr/local) by default.
You can define a different install path by setting PREFIX when running
Makefile.PL. For example, to install vuser in your home directory

	perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=~

or to install in /opt

	perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/opt

The install script will create lib, share and sbin directories in PREFIX.

If you install in a PREFIX that is not included in perl's default library
paths, you will need to set PERL5LIB to include the new directory. For
example, if you set PREFIX=/opt, you might add this to your .profile (or
/etc/profile).

	export PERL5LIB=/opt/lib/perl5/site_perl/
