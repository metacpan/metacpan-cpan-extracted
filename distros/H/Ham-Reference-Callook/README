SYNOPSIS
     use Ham::Reference::Callook;
     my $callook = Ham::Reference::Callook->new;

     # get the listing data for a callsign
     my $listing = $callook->listing('N8QQ');

     # print some info
     print "Name: $listing->{name}\n";

     # examine the entire hashref of callsign data
     use Data::Dumper;
     print Dumper($listing);

     # get data for another callsign in text format and print the block of text
     $callook->type('text');
     print $callook->listing('W8IRC');

DESCRIPTION
    The "Ham::Reference::Callook" module provides an easy object oriented
    front end to access Amateur Radio callsign data made available from the
    Callook.info web site.

    To help ensure foward compatibility with the data from the FCC provided
    by Callook.info, this module does not attempt to manage or filter
    individual data elements of a callsign. You will need to inspect the
    hash reference keys to see which elements are available for any given
    callsign, as demonstrated in the synopsis.

CONSTRUCTOR
  new()
     Usage    : my $callook = Ham::Reference::Callook->new;
     Function : creates a new Ham::Reference::Callook object
     Returns  : a Ham::Reference::Callook object
     Args     : a hash:

                key       required?   value
                -------   ---------   -----
                timeout   no          an integer of seconds to wait for
                                       the timeout of the xml site
                                       default = 10
                type      no          possible values are xml or text
                                       'xml' will cause the listing to be
                                       returned as a hash reference whose
                                       structure matches the XML returned
                                       from the Callook.info API.
                                       'text' will cause the listing to be
                                       returned as a single complete block
                                       of text in a scalar reference.
                                       default = xml

METHODS
  listing()
     Usage    : $hashref = $callook->listing($callsign) - OR - $scalar = $callook->listing($callsign}
     Function : retrieves data for the standard listing of a callsign from Callook.info
     Returns  : a hash reference if type is 'xml' (the default), or a scalar if type is 'text'
     Args     : a scalar (the callsign)

  type()
     Usage    : $callook->type($type}
     Function : sets the type of structure to retrieve when using the listing() method to get data 
     Returns  : n/a
     Args     : a scalar ('xml' or 'text')
     Notes    : 'xml' will cause the listing to be returned as a hash reference with a structure that
                  matches the XML returned from the Callook.info API.
                'text' will cause the listing to be returned as a single complete block of text in a
                  scalar reference.
                defaults to 'xml'

  timeout()
     Usage    : $callook->timeout($seconds);
     Function : sets the number of seconds to wait on the API server before timing out
     Returns  : n/a
     Args     : an integer

  is_error()
     Usage    : if ( $callook->is_error )
     Function : test for an error if one was returned from the call to the API site
     Returns  : a true value if there has been an error
     Args     : n/a

  error_message()
     Usage    : $err_msg = $callook->error_message;
     Function : if there was an error message when trying to call the API site, this is it
     Returns  : a string (the error message)
     Args     : n/a
