1.36 2012-01-17T08:09:17Z

1.34 2012-07-28T15:49:17Z

   TCP connection is in state CLOSE_WAIT

1.32 2012-04-06T00:45:17Z
 - Trim newlines passed to all commands, including continuation lines

 - Minor ASCII art updates

1.30 2011-10-25T11:30:17Z
 - Beginnings of a testsuite based on the RFC spec
 - Prepend, rather then append, un-asked-for message attributes, for picky
   clients

1.29 2010-08-02T10:42:17Z
 - Fix "UID SEARCH 1,2"
 - Allow "UID SEARCH *"
 - A better fix for [rt.cpan.org #58160], which is caused by a bug in
   DateTime::Format::Strptime ([rt.cpan.org #58459])

   a nonexistant method

1.28 2010-06-08T14:14:17Z
 - Prevent warnings when CLOSE is called
 - strftime("%e") can generate leading space, which strptime("%e") fails to
   parse; parse with strptime("%n%e")

 [rt.cpan.org #58160]
 - Ensure that EXAMINE collowed by SELECT in the same mailbox leaves it
   write-able [rt.cpan.org #58162]

1.27 2010-05-03T21:27:17Z
 - Make ->handle_command return the instance of the ::Command subclass that
   ran, for more useful subclassing

1.26 2009-12-15T22:31:17Z
 - Fix ->read_only to only care about ->selected_read_only if the mailbox
   is currently selected.
 - Add a ->select callback (defautls to doing nothing) on mailboxes which
   is called when it becomes selected.
 - The content returned by FETCH BODY[1] should be the raw content, without
   decoding transport encoding.

1.25 2009-11-07T23:58:17Z
 - BACKWARDS-INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: Net::IMAP::Server::Command's ->log method
   takes a loglevel argument by default, and simply defers to Net::Server's
   logging infratructure.
 - Handle more of Net::Server's arguments to ->new, including logging
 - Pass through arguments to Net::Server any arguments to ->run
 - Support mailboxes with flat hierarchies (undef hierarchy separator)

   messages to ever be marked \Recent

1.22 2009-07-13T12:13:17Z
 - Warning avoidance for "substr outside of string" warnings
 - Net::IMAP::Server::Command::UID still contained a reference to
   untagged_fetch

1.21 2009-07-09T14:52:17Z
 - Bump copyright, link to mailing list
 - Remove mostly undocumented an no-servicable-parts session_flags
 - untagged_* renamed to _unsent_* (and thus private)

1.20 2009-06-19T16:04:17Z
 - The logic for STATUS UNSEEN was backwards, counting the number of seen
   messages.  Reported by Paul Miller <jettero@cpan.org>

1.19 2009-06-19T13:26:17Z
 - Fix POD coverage on Net::IMAP::Server::Error

 - Document "NO" and "BAD" die() arguments
 - Fix mailbox read-only attribute

1.16 2009-04-07T23:45:17Z
 - Make UID fetches no longer O(range client requested), which is fragile
   when there are few messages but they are high in UID.

1.15 2009-04-06T12:49:17Z
 - Calls to ->header_raw were being made on Email::MIME objects, instead of
   Email::MIME::Header objects.  Reported by <dan@moore.cx>

1.14 2009-04-06T03:55:17Z
 - Bump Email::MIME dep, for ->header_raw method
 - Fix typo in RFC reference.  Reported by <dan@moore.cx>
 - Documentation typo fixes

1.13 2009-03-20T14:11:17Z
 - More UNSEEN fixes; the UNSEEN reported by STATUS and the UNSEEN reported
   by SELECT are different beasts, and have been split into different
   methods.

1.12 2009-03-10T13:46:17Z
 - Ensure that mailboxes passed to CREATE aren't trying to encode things
   they shouldn't be, by round-tripping and comparing.
 - Match query in LIST and LSUB against encoded path, not raw utf8 path
 - Support for adding new commands via 'add_command' in Net::IMAP::Server

1.11 2009-03-06T14:20:17Z
 - Move IMAP-UTF-7 handling into model's ->split, so it runs for _all_
   client-given input.	Then adjust ->handle_command to be able to send
   specific messages to the client on some exceptions.	Reported by Jan
   Dvorak <jdvorak@uikt.mendelu.cz>.
 - Add a case for the suspected edge case where a timeout or printing error
   is discovered while handling a command
 - Upper-case command name in "command not recognized" to not leak
   implementation as much

1.10 2009-03-05T14:27:17Z
 - Fix a major bug where UNSEEN reported the total number of unseen
   messages in the mailbox, rather than the sequence of the first unseen
   message.  Reported by Jan Dvorak <jdvorak@uikt.mendelu.cz>
 - Always return un-decoded headers to the client.  Reported by Jan Dvorak
   <jdvorak@uikt.mendelu.cz>
