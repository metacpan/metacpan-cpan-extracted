Sash version 1.01
=================

Sash is a tool to access common data sources. It was inspired by the many
character based database tools so that you could work with the Salesforce.com
API in the same manner as say MySQL. It supports a variety of data sources via
plugins that are readily available on CPAN.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make install
   
To some it might seem odd to not have to run make test but there really is nothing
to test.  Sash by itself only provides a framework for connecting and communicating
with various data sources.  You need install the appropriate plugin to work with
your data source of interest.

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules which are also readily available on CPAN:

Term::ShellUI 0.85
Data::Table 1.50
Text::ASCIITable 0.18
Term::ReadKey 2.30
Time::HiRes 1.86

DOCUMENTATION

Standard perldoc is available after you install sash or on the project website and CPAN.
