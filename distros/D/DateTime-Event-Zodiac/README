NAME
    DateTime::Event::Zodiac - Return zodiac for a given date

SYNOPSIS
      use DateTime::Event::Zodiac qw(zodiac_date_name zodiac_date_symbol zodiac_astro_name zodiac_astro_symbol);
      
  my $dt = DateTime->new( 
           year   => 1979,
           month  => 3,
           day    => 27,
      );

      print zodiac_date_name($dt);
      print zodiac_astro_symbol($dt);

    Returns the latin zodiac name or alternatively the unicode zodiac symbol
    for the given date. The zodiac may be calculated using either fixed
    dates or using the longitude/position of the sun.

    The module exports no symbols by default. All used functions must be
    requested in the use statement.

    All methods return undef on failiure.

DESCRIPTION
  zodiac_date_name
     $name = zodiac_date_name($dt);

    Latin zodiac name: aries, taurus, gemini, ... Fixed dates.

  zodiac_date_symbol
     $symbol = zodiac_date_symbol($dt);

    Unicode zodiac symbol positions U+2648 to U+2653 Fixed dates.

  zodiac_astro_name
     $name = zodiac_astro_name($dt);

    Latin zodiac name: aries, taurus, gemini, ... Calculated from the
    longitude/position of the sun.

  zodiac_astro_symbol
     $symbol = zodiac_astro_symbol($dt);

    Unicode zodiac symbol positions U+2648 to U+2653 Calculated from the
    longitude/position of the sun.

  zodiac_date
    Simply computes the zodiac from the date and returns a hash with the
    keys name, symbol, start and end.

    Used internally by "zodiac_date_name" and "zodiac_date_symbol"

  zodiac_astro
    Computes the zodiac from the position of the sun and returns a hash with
    the keys name, symbol, start and end. The keys start and end should be
    ignored since they are used for the "zodiac_date" function.

    May differ from the results of "zodiac_date" depending on the solar year
    (leap year ect).

    See DateTime::Util::Astro::Sun for notes on accuracy. If computed
    accurately enough this module should be also able to get the correct
    zodiac for the exact time of birth.

    Used internally by "zodiac_astro_name" and "zodiac_astro_symbol"

DISCLAIMER
    The author of this module regads astrology as being a pseudoscience and
    superstition. I wrote this module for my job. I was young, foolish and I
    needed the money.

TODO
    The "zodiac_astro_horoscope" and "zodiac_date_horoscope" functions have
    not yet been implemented ;-)
