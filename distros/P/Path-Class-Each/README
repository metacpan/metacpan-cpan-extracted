SYNOPSIS
      use Path::Class;
      use Path::Class::Each;

      ## Files ##

      # Iterator interface
      my $iter = file( 'foo', 'bar' )->iterator;
      while ( defined( my $line = $iter->() ) ) {
        print "Line: $line\n";
      }

      # 'next' interface
      my $file = file( 'foo', 'bar' );
      while ( defined( my $line = $file->next ) ) {
        print "Line: $line\n";
      }

      # Callback interface
      file( 'foo', 'bar' )->each(
        sub {
          print "Line: $_\n";
        }
      );

      ## Directories ##
  
      # Iterator interface
      my $iter = dir( 'foo', 'bar' )->iterator;
      while ( defined( my $file = $iter->() ) ) {
        print "File: $file\n";
      }

      # 'next' interface
      my $file = dir( 'foo', 'bar' );
      while ( defined( my $file = $dir->next_file ) ) {
        print "File: $file\n";
      }

      # Callback interface
      dir( 'foo', 'bar' )->each(
        sub {
          print "File: $_\n";
        }
      );

DESCRIPTION
    "Path::Class::Each" augments Path::Class::File and Path::Class::Dir to
    provide three different ways of iterating over the lines of a file and
    three ways of iterating the files recursively contained in a directory.

    "Path::Class::File" provides a "slurp" method that returns the contents
    of a file (either as a scalar or an array) but has no support for
    reading a file a line at a time. For large files it may be desirable to
    iterate through the lines; that's where this module comes in.

    "Path::Class::Dir" provides "children" which returns the files and
    directories immediately contained in a directory but does not expose a
    'find' interface to recursively search a directory. This module provides
    iterators that visit all the files in the directory tree below a
    directory.

INTERFACE
  File Iterators
   "Path::Class::File->iterator"
    Get an iterator that returns the lines in a file. Returns "undef" when
    there are no more lines to return.

      my $iter = file( 'foo', 'bar' )->iterator;
      while ( defined( my $line = $iter->() ) ) {
        print "Line: $line\n";
      }

    If the file can not be opened an exception will be thrown (using
    "croak").

    The following options may be passed as key, value pairs:

    "chomp"
        Newlines will be trimmed from each line read.

    "iomode"
        Passed as the "mode" argument to "open". See Path::Class::File::open
        for details. If omitted defaults to 'r' (read-only).

    Here's how options are passed:

      my $chomper = file('foo', 'bar')->iterator( chomp => 1 );

   "Path::Class::File->next"
    Return the next line from a file. Returns "undef" when all lines have
    been read.

    Internally iterator is called if necessary to create a new iterator. The
    same options that iterator accepts may be passed to "next":

      my $file = file( 'foo', 'bar' );
      while ( defined( my $line = $file->next( chomp => 1 ) ) ) {
        print "Line: $line\n";
      }

   NOTE
    It may be tempting to use an idiom like:

      # DON'T DO THIS
      while ( my $line = file('foo')->next ) {
        ...
      }

    That will create a new "Path::Class::File" and, therefore, a new
    iterator each time it is called with the result that the first line of
    the file will be returned repeatedly.

   "Path::Class::File->each"
    Call a supplied callback for each line in a file. The same options that
    iterator accepts may be passed:

      file( 'foo', 'bar' )->each( chomp => 1, sub { print "Line: $_\n" } );

    Within the callback the current line will be in $_.

  Directory Iterators
   "Path::Class::Dir->iterator"
    Return an iterator that returns each of the files in and below a
    directory.

    By default only files are returned. The following options may be
    supplied to modify this behaviour:

    "dirs"
        Return directories as well as files.

    "no_files"
        Return directories only.

   "Path::Class::Dir->next_file"
    Return the next file from a recursive search of a directory. Returns
    "undef" when all lines have been read.

    Internally iterator is called if necessary to create a new iterator. The
    same options that iterator accepts may be passed to "next_file":

      my $dir = dir( 'foo', 'bar' );
      while ( defined( my $file = $dir->next_file ) ) {
        print "File: $file\n";
      }

   "Path::Class::Dir->next_dir"
    Return the next directory from a recursive search of a directory.

   "Path::Class::Dir->each"
    Call a supplied callback for each file in a directory. The same options
    that iterator accepts may be passed:

      dir( 'foo', 'bar' )->each( dirs => 1, sub { print "Object: $_\n" } );

    Within the callback the current file will be in $_.

   "Path::Class::Dir->each_dir"
    Call a supplied callback for each subdirectory in a directory.
