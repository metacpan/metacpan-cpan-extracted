NAME
    Log::ger::For::Class - Add logging to class

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.003 of Log::ger::For::Class (from Perl
    distribution Log-ger-For-Class), released on 2019-01-06.

SYNOPSIS
     use Log::ger::For::Class qw(add_logging_to_class);
     add_logging_to_class(classes => [qw/My::Class My::SubClass/]);
     # now method calls to your classes are logged, by default at level 'trace'

DESCRIPTION
    Most of the things that apply to Log::ger::For::Package also applies to
    this module, since this module uses add_logging_to_package() as its
    backend.

FUNCTIONS
  add_logging_to_class
    Usage:

     add_logging_to_class(%args) -> any

    Add logging to class.

    Logging will be done using Log::ger.

    Currently this function adds logging around method calls, e.g.:

     -> Class::method(...)
     <- Class::method() = RESULT
     ...

    This function is not exported.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   classes* => *array[str]*

        Classes to add logging to.

    *   filter_methods => *array[str]*

        Filter methods to add logging to.

        The default is to add logging to all non-private methods. Private
        methods are those prefixed by "_".

    *   import_hook => *bool* (default: 0)

        Whether to install import (@INC) hook instead.

        If this setting is true, then instead of installing logging to all
        existing packages, an @INC import hook will be installed instead so
        that subsequent modules that are loaded and that match "packages"
        will be logged. So to log all subsequent loaded modules, you can set
        "packages" to "['.*']".

    *   logger_args => *any*

        Pass arguments to logger.

        This allows passing arguments to logger routine.

    *   postcall_logger => *code*

        Supply custom postcall logger.

        Just like "precall_logger", but code will be called after
        subroutine/method is called. Code will be given a hashref argument
        \%args containing these keys: "args" (arrayref, a shallow copy of
        the original @_), "orig" (coderef, the original subroutine/method),
        "name" (string, the fully-qualified subroutine/method name),
        "result" (arrayref, the subroutine/method result), "logger_args"
        (arguments given when adding logging).

        You can use this mechanism to customize logging.

    *   precall_logger => *code*

        Supply custom precall logger.

        Code will be called when logging subroutine/method call. Code will
        be given a hashref argument \%args containing these keys: "args"
        (arrayref, a shallow copy of the original @_), "orig" (coderef, the
        original subroutine/method), "name" (string, the fully-qualified
        subroutine/method name), "logger_args" (arguments given when adding
        logging).

        You can use this mechanism to customize logging.

        The default logger accepts these arguments (can be supplied via
        "logger_args"):

        *   "indent" => INT (default: 0)

        Indent according to nesting level.

        *   "max_depth" => INT (default: -1)

        Only log to this nesting level. -1 means unlimited.

        *   "log_sub_args" => BOOL (default: 1)

        Whether to display subroutine arguments when logging subroutine
        entry. The default can also be supplied via environment
        "LOG_SUB_ARGS".

        *   "log_sub_result" => BOOL (default: 1)

        Whether to display subroutine result when logging subroutine exit.
        The default can also be set via environment "LOG_SUB_RESULT".

    Return value: (any)
