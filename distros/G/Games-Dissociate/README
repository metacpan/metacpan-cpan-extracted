Games::Dissociate - a Dissociated Press algorithm and filter

NAME
    Games::Dissociate - a Dissociated Press algorithm and filter

SYNOPSIS
        use Games::Dissociate;
        ...
        $brilliant_prose = dissociate($normal_prose);

    or

        perl -MGames::Dissociate -e dissociate_filter meno.txt

ABSTRACT
    This module provides the function `dissociate', which implements a
    Dissociated Press algorithm, well known to Emacs users as "meta-x
    dissociate". The algorithm here is by no means a straight port of
    Emacs's `dissociate.el', but is instead merely inspired by it.

    (I actually intended to make it a straight port, but couldn't manage it
    -- the code in `dissociate.el' is totally uncommented, and is
    *especially* obscure Lisp.)

    This module also provides a procedure `dissociate_filter', for use in
    the one-liner context:

      perl -MGames::Dissociate -e 'dissociate_filter(2)'
        < thesis.txt  > snip.txt

    or

      perl -MGames::Dissociate -e 'dissociate_filter(-2)'
        < thesis.txt  > snip.txt

    or in a script consisting of

      #!/usr/local/bin/perl
      use Games::Dissociate;  dissociate_filter;

  Sample Dissociation

    I got this text from feeding the UNIX man page for "regexp" (in
    plaintext) to `dissociate' with a $group_size parameter of 3:

        nd of then the full list of the more branch is zero or "*", "."
        (matching thand regexp(n) right initional argumented by a pieces of
        the left to match that (ab|a) general other worDS match to the

PREREQUISITES

This suite requires Perl 5; I've only used it under Perl 5.004, so for
anything lower, you're on your own.

Games::Dissociate doesn't use any nonstandard modules.


INSTALLATION

You install Games::Dissociate, as you would install any perl module
library, by running these commands:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

If you want to install a private copy of Games::Dissociate in your home
directory, then you should try to produce the initial Makefile with
something like this command:

  perl Makefile.PL LIB=~/perl

For more information on module installation, see perldoc perlmodinstall


DOCUMENTATION

POD-format documentation is included in Dissociate.pm.  POD is readable
with the 'perldoc' utility.  See ChangeLog for recent changes.


MACPERL INSTALLATION NOTES

Don't bother with the makefiles.  Just make a Games directory in your
MacPerl site_lib or lib directory, and move Dissociate.pm into there.
