Revision history for Perl extension NSS.

0.04  2008-10-22
    - LWPCompat now overrides configure so http_configure in Net::HTTP::Methods gets called correctly.
    - LWPCompat now also sets $Net::HTTPS::SSL_SOCKET_CLASS for you on import.
    - Net::NSS::SSL now has a $DefaultURL global that can be set to override default behavior of setting
      verification URL to what PeerHost says.
    - Now really supports verification hooks. Also a "built-in-ignore" hook exists to skip verification.
    - Read now sets passed buffer to an empty string if 0 bytes was read instead of to undefined.
