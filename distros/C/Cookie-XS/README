NAME
    Cookie::XS - HTTP Cookie parser in C (Please use CGI::Cookie::XS
    instead)

VERSION
    This document describes Cookie::XS 0.11 released on September 12, 2008.

SYNOPSIS
        use Cookie::XS;

        my $raw_cookie = 'foo=a%20phrase; haha; bar=yes%2C%20a%20phrase; baz=%5Ewibble&leiyh; qux=%27';
        my $res = Cookie::XS->parse($raw_cookie);
        # $res is something like:
        #    {
        #      'bar' => [
        #                 'yes, a phrase'
        #               ],
        #      'baz' => [
        #                 '^wibble',
        #                 'leiyh'
        #               ],
        #      'foo' => [
        #                 'a phrase'
        #               ],
        #      'qux' => [
        #                 '\''
        #               ]
        #    };

        # or directly read raw cookies from the CGI environments:
        $res = Cookie::XS->fetch;

DESCRIPTION
    WARNING: This module is obsolete now; please use CGI::Cookie::XS
    instead.

    This module implements a very simple parser for cookies used in HTTP
    applications. We've found CGI::Simple::Cookie and CGI::Cookie rather
    slow according to the profiling results for our OpenResty project, hence
    the rewrite in C.

    This library is still in pre-alpha stage and the API is still in flux.
    We're just following the "release early, releaes often" guideline. So
    please check back often ;)

METHODS
    We currently provide 2 static methods, "parse" and "fetch". They work
    mostly the same way as those methods found in CGI::Cookie and
    CGI::Simple::Cookie but with the exception that our version returns
    plain Perl data structures rather than hashes of Perl objects (due to
    performance considerations).

    We'll implement some cookie dump methods in the near future.

    "$ref = Cookie::XS->parse($raw_cookie)"
        Parses $raw_cookie and returns the reference of a hash of arrays.
        The keys of the hash are cookie variables' names while the values of
        the hash are lists of cookie variable's values.

        There is a length limit on the $raw_cookie. If $raw_cookie is longer
        than 4 KB (i.e. 4 * 1024 bytes, excluding the trailing '\0'), the
        overflowing part will be truncated.

        Also note that, "fetch" does not assume any encoding on the cookie
        values. It just decodes the encoded entries verbatim and treat them
        as plain "binary" stuff.

    "$ref = Cookie::XS->fetch()"
        Reads the raw cookie from the "HTTP_COOKIE" and "COOKIE"
        environments (which are usually set by HTTP servers like lighttd or
        apache) and then parses the value using the "parse" method and
        finally returns the results.

TODO
    *   Removing trailing spaces in cookie values.

    There is anonymous access to all. If you'd like a commit bit, please let
    us know. :)

BUGS
    There must be some serious bugs lurking somewhere. We haven't done
    comprehensive testing for our code yet. It's a TODO.
