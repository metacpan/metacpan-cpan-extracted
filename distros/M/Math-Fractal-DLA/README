Math::Fractal::DLA version 0.20
===============================

Math::Fractal::DLA is a Diffusion Limited Aggregation (DLA) fractal generator

The Diffusion Limited Aggregation (DLA) fractal belongs to the group of stochastic fractals.

It was invented by the two physicists T.A. Witten and L.M. Sander in 1981. The fractal is created by single particles which move randomly towards an target area. By hitting the area the particle becomes a part of it and the fractal grows.

Math::Fractal::DLA is just the framework for subclasses like Math::Fractal::DLA::Explode and doesn't implement any methods for fractal generation. To generate a fractal, you have to create a Math::Fractal::DLA object and load the subclass by calling the method setType. Otherwise you have to use an object from a subclass directly without calling the method setType. For the specific methods of the subclasses, take a look at their perldoc.
