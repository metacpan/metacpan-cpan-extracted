Document-eSign-Docusign

XXX - This module is NOT ready for production use. I am placing it on
CPAN to gauge community interest. I will keep developing it but plan
to release incrementally. If you see this message dissappear then you
know this module is ready for public use.

Welcome! I assume if you're reading this, you know what Docusign is
so I will spare you in that regard. Where you will not be spared is in
my archaic style of perl. No there is no Majestik Møøse in here this 
is vanilla perl. Where possible I've kept reliance on modules to those
that are generally in the core distribution on most Linux distributions.

This module will be perl's interface to the JSON/REST API that DS 
provides. If you need a primer, consider visiting http://demo.docusign.net.
