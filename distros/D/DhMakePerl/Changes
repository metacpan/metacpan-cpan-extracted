    FromCPAN: remove leading 'v' from versions

    add Debian::DpkgLists - 'dpkg -S' on steroids

    FromCPAN: use Debian::DpkgLists as a last resort. This allows finding
        dependencies that are present in locally-installed packages.
        (Debian bug #478781)

    Dependency: the 'ver' member is an instance of Dpkg::Version
        Use its ability to compare and drop Debian::Version

    Dependenc{y,ies}: reduce '--' to '-' in the NAME POD section

    make: try harder to discover already existing package by looking up
        distribution modules in APT contents and dpkg file lists.

    replace CPAN::Config->load with CPAN:Handle::Config->load
        the former seems obsolete and only warns:
            Dispatching deprecated method 'CPAN::Config::load' to
            CPAN::HandleConfig

    added README

    added xt/pod-spelling.t to help test POD spelling
