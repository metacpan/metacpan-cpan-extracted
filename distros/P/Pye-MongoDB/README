NAME
    Pye::MongoDB - Log with Pye on top of MongoDB

SYNOPSIS
            use Pye::MongoDB;

            my $pye = Pye::MongoDB->new(
                    host => 'mongodb://logserver1:27017,logserver2:27017',
                    find_master => 1,
                    database => 'log_db',
                    collection => 'myapp_log'
            );

            # now start logging
            $pye->log($session_id, "Some log message", { data => 'example data' });

            # inspect the logs from the command line
            pye -b MongoDB -d log_db -c myapp_log

DESCRIPTION
    This package provides a MongoDB backend for the Pye logging system. This
    is currently the easiest backend to use, since no setup is needed in
    order to start logging with it.

    Messages will be stored in a MongoDB database with the following keys:

    *   "session_id" - the session ID, a string, always exists

    *   "date" - the date the messages was logged, in ISODate format, always
        exists

    *   "text" - the text of the message, a string, always exists

    *   "data" - supplemental JSON structure, optional

    An index on the "session_id" field will automatically be created.

  NOTES AND RECOMMENDATIONS
    As of this writing (MongoDB v2.6), MongoDB is kind of a storage guzzler.
    You might find it useful to create a TTL index on the log collection.
    For example, the following line (entered into the "mongo" shell) will
    create a time-to-live index of 2 days on a log collection:

            db.log_collection.ensureIndex({ date: 1 }, { expireAfterSeconds: 172800 })

    Alternatively, you could make the collection capped and limit it by
    size. Note, however, that the _remove_session_logs() method will not
    work in that case.

    Also, consider using TokuMX as a drop-in replacement for MongoDB. It it
    faster, uses much less storage space and supports ACID transactions.

  USING THE pye COMMAND LINE UTILITY
    The pye command line utility, used to inspect logs, provides all command
    line options to the "new( [ %options ] )" constructor, which in turn
    passes anything to MongoDB::MongoClient. This means that if your
    database has replication, or requires authentication, you can provide
    these options from the command line.

    For example:

            pye -b MongoDB
                --host mongodb://server1:27017,server2:27017
                --find_master=1
                -d log_db
                -c myapp_log
                --username log_user
                --password very_secret

    "host", "find_master", "username" and "password" in this example will be
    passed to "MongoDB::MongoClient".

CONSTRUCTOR
  new( [ %options ] )
    Create a new instance of this class. All options are optional.

    *   database - the name of the database, defaults to "logs"

    *   collection (or table) - the name of the collection, defaults to
        "logs"

    *   be_safe - whether to enable the "safe" flag when inserting log
        messages, defaults to a false value

    Any other option you provide will be passed to MongoDB::MongoClient, so
    pass anything needed in order to connect to the database server (such as
    "host", "find_master", etc.).

OBJECT METHODS
    The following methods implement the Pye role, so you should refer to
    "Pye" for their documentation. Some methods, however, have some
    MongoDB-specific notes, so keep reading.

  log( $session_id, $text, [ \%data ] )
    If "\%data" is provided, this module will traverse it recursively,
    replacing any hash-key that contains dots with semicolons, as MongoDB
    does not support dots in field names.

  session_log( $session_id )
  list_sessions( [ \%opts ] )
    Takes all options defined by Pye. The "sort" option, however, takes a
    MongoDB sorting definition, that is a hash-ref, e.g. "{ _id => 1 }".
    This will default to "{ date => -1 }".

    "Pye::MongoDB" requires no configuration files or environment variables.
