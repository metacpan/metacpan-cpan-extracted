Revision history for Getopt-Type-Tiny

2025-01-24 Version 0.03

    - All changes via a PR from Toby Inkster. Thank you!
    - Eliminates the need for Getopt::Type::Tiny::Types and removes the module.
    - Removes the dependency on Ref::Util by using is_CodeRef from Types::Standard.
    - Replaces a manual ref eq 'HASH' check with is_HashRef from Types::Standard.
    - For defaults which are coderefs, delays calling $default->() until after running GetOptions, so we can skip calling the coderef at all when the user has provided an explicit value.
    - Could consider passing %opt_for as a parameter to the coderef?
    - Adds support for coerce => 1 to option specs.
