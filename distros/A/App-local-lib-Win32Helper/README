NAME
    App::local::lib::Win32Helper - Helper for Win32 users of local::lib.

VERSION
    Version 0.992

SYNOPSIS
    This module is a placeholder for the llwin32helper script, which saves
    the environment variables that local::lib requires for its use to the
    Windows registry.

    To run it, just type

        llw32helper

    at the command prompt.

    There are no command line parameters.

CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT
    The default directory to create a local::lib library in is determined by
    $ENV{HOME} if that is given, or the user's default directory if that is
    not defined.

    The script saves and retrieves information using the Windows registry.

DEPENDENCIES
    This script depends on Perl 5.8.1 (because local::lib depends on it) and
    also depends on "local::lib" version 1.004007, IO::Interactive 0.0.5,
    File::HomeDir 0.81, Win32::TieRegistry 0.26, and File::Spec 3.2701.
