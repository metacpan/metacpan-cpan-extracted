WebService::BitbucketServer::RefRestriction::V2 - Bindings for a Bitbucket Server REST API

=head1 VERSION

version 0.604

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $stash = WebService::BitbucketServer->new(
        base_url    => 'https://stash.example.com/',
        username    => 'bob',
        password    => 'secret',
    );
    my $api = $stash->ref_restriction;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a Bitbucket Server REST API for L<RefRestriction::V2|https://developer.atlassian.com/static/rest/bitbucket-server/5.10.0/bitbucket-ref-restriction-rest.html>.

Original API documentation created by and copyright Atlassian.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 context

Get the instance of L<WebService::BitbucketServer> passed to L</new>.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new

    $api = WebService::BitbucketServer::RefRestriction::V2->new(context => $webservice_bitbucketserver_obj);

Create a new API.

Normally you would use C<<< $webservice_bitbucketserver_obj->ref_restriction >>> instead.

=head2 get_restrictions_for_repository

Search for restrictions using the supplied parameters.

The authenticated user must have B<<< REPO_ADMIN >>> permission or higher to call this resource.
Only authenticated users may call this resource.

    GET branch-permissions/2.0/projects/{projectKey}/repos/{repositorySlug}/restrictions

Parameters:

=over 4

=item * C<<< type >>> - string, default: none

(optional) types of restrictions to filter on: one of 'read-only', 'no-deletes', 'fast-forward-only' or 'pull-request-only'.

=item * C<<< matcherType >>> - string, default: none

(optional) matcher type to filter on: one of 'BRANCH', 'PATTERN', 'MODEL_CATEGORY' or 'MODEL_BRANCH'.
