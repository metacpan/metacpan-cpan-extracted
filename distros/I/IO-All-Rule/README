NAME
    IO::All::Rule - Iterative, recursive file finder with IO::All

VERSION
    version 0.003

SYNOPSIS
      use IO::All::Rule;

      my $rule = IO::All::Rule->new; # match anything
      $rule->file->size(">10k");     # add/chain rules

      # iterator interface
      my $next = $rule->iter( @dirs );
      while ( my $file = $next->() ) {
        ...
      }

      # list interface
      for my $file ( $rule->all( @dirs ) ) {
        ...
      }

DESCRIPTION
    This module iterates over files and directories to identify ones
    matching a user-defined set of rules.

    This is a thin subclass of Path::Iterator::Rule that operates on and
    returns IO::All objects instead of bare file paths.

    See that module for details on features and usage.

    See "PERFORMANCE" for important caveats. You might want to use
    "Path::Iterator::Rule" instead.

EXTENDING
    This module may be extended in the same way as "Path::Iterator::Rule",
    but test subroutines receive "IO::All" objects instead of strings.

    Consider whether you should extend "Path::Iterator::Rule" or
    "IO::All::Rule". Extending this module specifically is recommended if
    your tests rely on having a "IO::All" object.

LEXICAL WARNINGS
    If you run with lexical warnings enabled, "Path::Iterator::Rule" will
    issue warnings in certain circumstances (such as a read-only directory
    that must be skipped). To disable these categories, put the following
    statement at the correct scope:

      no warnings 'Path::Iterator::Rule';

PERFORMANCE
    Because all files and directories as processed as "IO::All" objects,
    using this module is significantly slower than "Path::Iterator::Rule".

    If you are scanning tens of thousands of files and speed is a concern,
    you might be better off using that instead and only creating objects
    from results.

        use IO::All;
        use Path::Iterator::Rule;

        my $rule = Path::Iterator::Rule->new->file->size(">10k");
        my $next = $rule->iter( @dirs );

        while ( my $file = io($next->()) ) {
            ...
        }

    Generally, I recommend use this module only if you need to write custom
    rules that need "IO::All" features.
