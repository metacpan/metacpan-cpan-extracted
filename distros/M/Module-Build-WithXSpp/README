NAME
    Module::Build::WithXSpp - XS++ enhanced flavour of Module::Build

SYNOPSIS
    In Build.PL:

      use strict;
      use warnings;
      use 5.006001;
  
      use Module::Build::WithXSpp;
  
      my $build = Module::Build::WithXSpp->new(
        # normal Module::Build arguments...
        # optional: mix in some extra C typemaps:
        extra_typemap_modules => {
          'ExtUtils::Typemaps::ObjectMap' => '0',
        },
      );
      $build->create_build_script;

DESCRIPTION
    This subclass of Module::Build adds some tools and processes to make it
    easier to use for wrapping C++ using XS++ (ExtUtils::XSpp).

    There are a few minor differences from using "Module::Build" for an
    ordinary XS module and a few conventions that you should be aware of as
    an XS++ module author. They are documented in the "FEATURES AND
    CONVENTIONS" section below. But if you can't be bothered to read all
    that, you may choose skip it and blindly follow the advice in "JUMP
    START FOR THE IMPATIENT".

    An example of a full distribution based on this build tool can be found
    in the ExtUtils::XSpp distribution under examples/XSpp-Example. Using
    that example as the basis for your "Module::Build::WithXSpp"-based
    distribution is probably a good idea.

FEATURES AND CONVENTIONS
  XS files
    By default, "Module::Build::WithXSpp" will automatically generate a main
    XS file for your module which includes all XS++ files and does the
    correct incantations to support C++.

    If "Module::Build::WithXSpp" detects any XS files in your module, it
    will skip the generation of this default file and assume that you wrote
    a custom main XS file. If that is not what you want, and wish to simply
    include plain XS code, then you should put the XS in a verbatim block of
    an .xsp file. In case you need to use the plain-C part of an XS file for
    "#include" directives and other code, then put your code into a header
    file and "#include" it from an .xsp file:

    In src/mystuff.h:

      #include <something>
      using namespace some::thing;

    In xsp/MyClass.xsp

      #include "mystuff.h"
  
      %{
        ... verbatim XS here ...
      %}

    Note that there is no guarantee about the order in which the XS++ files
    are picked up.

  Build directory
    When building your XS++ based extension, a temporary build directory
    buildtmp is created for the byproducts. It is automatically cleaned up
    by "./Build clean".

  Source directories
    A Perl module distribution typically has the module ".pm" files in its
    lib subdirectory. In a "Module::Build::WithXSpp" based distribution,
    there are two more such conventions about source directories:

    If any C++ source files are present in the src directory, they will be
    compiled to object files and linked automatically.

    Any ".xs", ".xsp", and ".xspt" files in an xs or xsp subdirectory will
    be automatically picked up and included by the build system.

    For backwards compatibility, files of the above types are also
    recognized in lib.

  Typemaps
    In XS++, there are two types of typemaps: The ordinary XS typemaps which
    conventionally put in a file called typemap, and XS++ typemaps.

    The ordinary XS typemaps will be found in the main directory, under lib,
    and in the XS directories (xs and xsp). They are required to carry the
    ".map" extension or to be called typemap. You may use multiple .map
    files if the entries do not collide. They will be merged at build time
    into a complete typemap file in the temporary build directory.

    The "extra_typemap_modules" option is the prefered way to do XS
    typemapping. It works like any other "Module::Build" argument that
    declares dependencies except that it loads the listed modules at build
    time and includes their typemaps into the build.

    The XS++ typemaps are required to carry the ".xspt" extension or (for
    backwards compatibility) to be called "typemap.xsp".

  Detecting the C++ compiler
    "Module::Build::WithXSpp" uses ExtUtils::CppGuess to detect a C++
    compiler on your system that is compatible with the C compiler that was
    used to compile your perl binary. It sets some additional
    compiler/linker options.

    This is known to work on GCC (Linux, MacOS, Windows, and ?) as well as
    the MS VC toolchain. Patches to enable other compilers are very welcome.

  Automatic dependencies
    "Module::Build::WithXSpp" automatically adds several dependencies (on
    the currently running versions) to your distribution. You can disable
    this by setting "auto_configure_requires => 0" in Build.PL.

    These are at configure time: "Module::Build", "Module::Build::WithXSpp"
    itself, and "ExtUtils::CppGuess". Additionally there will be a
    build-time dependency on "ExtUtils::XSpp".

    You do not have to set these dependencies yourself unless you need to
    set the required versions manually.

  Include files
    Unfortunately, including the perl headers produces quite some pollution
    and redefinition of common symbols. Therefore, it may be necessary to
    include some of your headers before including the perl headers.
    Specifically, this is the case for MSVC compilers and the standard
    library headers.

    Therefore, if you care about that platform in the least, you should use
    the "early_includes" option when creating a "Module::Build::WithXSpp"
    object to list headers to include before the perl headers. If such a
    supplied header file starts with a double quote, "#include "..."" is
    used, otherwise "#include <...>" is the default. Example:

      Module::Build::WithXSpp->new(
        early_includes => [qw(
          "mylocalheader.h"
          <mysystemheader.h>
        )]
      )

JUMP START FOR THE IMPATIENT
    There are as many ways to start a new CPAN distribution as there are
    CPAN distributions. Choose your favourite (I just do "h2xs -An
    My::Module"), then apply a few changes to your setup:

    * Obliterate any Makefile.PL.

      This is what your Build.PL should look like:

        use strict;
        use warnings;
        use 5.006001;
        use Module::Build::WithXSpp;
  
        my $build = Module::Build::WithXSpp->new(
          module_name         => 'My::Module',
          license             => 'perl',
          dist_author         => q{John Doe <john_does_mail_address>},
          dist_version_from   => 'lib/My/Module.pm',
          build_requires => { 'Test::More' => 0, },
          extra_typemap_modules => {
            'ExtUtils::Typemaps::ObjectMap' => '0',
            # ...
          },
        );
        $build->create_build_script;

      If you need to link against some library "libfoo", add this to the
      options:

          extra_linker_flags => [qw(-lfoo)],

      There is "extra_compiler_flags", too, if you need it.

    * You create two folders in the main distribution folder: src and xsp.

    * You put any C++ code that you want to build and include in the module
      into src/. All the typical C(++) file extensions are recognized and
      will be compiled to object files and linked into the module. And
      headers in that folder will be accessible for "#include <myheader.h>".

      For good measure, move a copy of ppport.h to that directory. See
      Devel::PPPort.

    * You do not write normal XS files. Instead, you write XS++ and put it
      into the xsp/ folder in files with the ".xsp" extension. Do not worry,
      you can include verbatim XS blocks in XS++. For details on XS++, see
      ExtUtils::XSpp.

    * If you need to do any XS type mapping, put your typemaps into a .map
      file in the "xsp" directory. Alternatively, search CPAN for an
      appropriate typemap module (cf. ExtUtils::Typemaps::Default for an
      explanation). XS++ typemaps belong into .xspt files in the same
      directory.

    * In this scheme, lib/ only contains Perl module files (and POD). If you
      started from a pure-Perl distribution, don't forget to add these magic
      two lines to your main module:

        require XSLoader;
        XSLoader::load('My::Module', $VERSION);

SEE ALSO
    Module::Build upon which this module is based.

    ExtUtils::XSpp implements XS++. The "ExtUtils::XSpp" distribution
    contains an examples directory with a usage example of this module.

    ExtUtils::Typemaps implements progammatic modification (merging) of C/XS
    typemaps. "ExtUtils::Typemaps" was renamed from "ExtUtils::Typemap"
    since the original name conflicted with the core typemap file on
    case-insensitive file systems.

    ExtUtils::Typemaps::Default explains the concept of having typemaps
    shipped as modules.

    ExtUtils::Typemaps::ObjectMap is such a typemap module and probably very
    useful for any XS++ module.

    ExtUtils::Typemaps::STL::String implements simple typemapping for STL
    "std::string"s.
