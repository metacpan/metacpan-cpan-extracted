NAME
    Class::Field - Class Field Accessor Generator

SYNOPSIS
        package Thing;
        use Class::Field qw'field const';

        field 'this';
        field 'list' => [];
        field 'map' => {};
        field 'that', -init => '$self->setup_that';
        field 'circular_ref' => -weaken;
        const 'answer' => 42;

DESCRIPTION
    Class::Field exports two subroutines, "field" and "const". These
    functions are used to declare fields and constants in your class.

    Class::Field generates custom code for each accessor that is optimized
    for speed.

FUNCTIONS
    "field"
        Defines accessor methods for a field of your class:

            package Example;
            use base 'Parent';
            use Class::Field qw'field const';

            field 'foo';
            field bar => [];

            sub lalala {
                my $self = shift;
                $self->foo(42);
                push @{$self->{bar}}, $self->foo;
            }

        The first parameter passed to "field" is the name of the attribute
        being defined. Accessors can be given an optional default value.
        This value will be returned if no value for the field has been set
        in the object.

    "const"
            const bar => 42;

        The "const" function is similar to <field> except that it is
        immutable. It also does not store data in the object. You probably
        always want to give a "const" a default value, otherwise the
        generated method will be somewhat useless.

NOTE
    This code was taken directly out the Spiffy module for those people who
    just want this functionality without using the rest of Spiffy.
