  [ CHANGED ]
    - Forked into Dancer2::Plugin::Adaptor for proper Dancer2 support

      just a bad idea all around.

  [ ADDED ]
    - Added 'scope' option to control lifecycle of created objects

  [ CHANGED ]
    - Default scope is now 'request' instead of (effectively) 'singleton'
      in the previous implementation.  This makes the default behavior
      safer to ensure data is not leaked between requests.
