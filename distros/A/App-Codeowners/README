DESCRIPTION

    git-codeowners is yet another CLI tool for managing CODEOWNERS files in
    git repos. In particular, it can be used to quickly find out who owns a
    particular file in a monorepo (or monolith).

    THIS IS EXPERIMENTAL! The interface of this tool and its modules will
    probably change as I field test some things. Feedback welcome.

INSTALL

    There are several ways to install git-codeowners to your system.

 from CPAN

    You can install git-codeowners using cpanm:

        cpanm App::Codeowners

 from GitHub

    You can also choose to download git-codeowners as a self-contained
    executable:

        curl -OL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chazmcgarvey/git-codeowners/solo/git-codeowners
        chmod +x git-codeowners

    To hack on the code, clone the repo instead:

        git clone https://github.com/chazmcgarvey/git-codeowners.git
        cd git-codeowners
        make bootstrap      # installs dependencies; requires cpanm

OPTIONS

 --version

    Print the program name and version to STDOUT, and exit.

    Alias: -v

 --help

    Print the synopsis to STDOUT, and exit.

    Alias: -h

    You can also use --manual to print the full documentation.

 --color

    Enable colorized output.

    Color is ON by default on terminals; use --no-color to disable. Some
    environment variables may also alter the behavior of colorizing output:

      * NO_COLOR - Set to disable color (same as --no-color).

      * COLOR_DEPTH - Set the number of supportable colors (e.g. 0, 16,
      256, 16777216).

 --format

    Specify the output format to use. See "FORMAT".

    Alias: -f

 --shell-completion

        eval "$(lintany --shell-completion)"

    Print shell code to enable completion to STDOUT, and exit.

    Does not yet support Zsh...

COMMANDS

 show

        git-codeowners [show] [--format FORMAT] [--owner OWNER]...
                       [--pattern PATTERN]... [--[no-]patterns]
                       [--project PROJECT]... [--[no-]projects] [PATH...]

    Show owners of one or more files in a repo.

    If --owner, --project, --pattern are set, only show files with matching
    criteria. These can be repeated.

    Use --patterns to also show the matching pattern associated with each
    file.

    By default the output might show associated projects if the CODEOWNERS
    file defines them. You can control this by explicitly using --projects
    or --no-projects to always show or always hide defined projects,
    respectively.

 owners

        git-codeowners owners [--format FORMAT] [--pattern PATTERN]

    List all owners defined in the CODEOWNERS file.

 patterns

        git-codeowners patterns [--format FORMAT] [--owner OWNER]

    List all patterns defined in the CODEOWNERS file.

 create

        git-codeowners create [REPO_DIRPATH|CODEOWNERS_FILEPATH]

    Create a new CODEOWNERS file for a specified repo (or current
    directory).

 update

        git-codeowners update [REPO_DIRPATH|CODEOWNERS_FILEPATH]

    Update the "unowned" list of an existing CODEOWNERS file for a
    specified repo (or current directory).

FORMAT

    The --format argument can be one of:

      * csv - Comma-separated values (requires Text::CSV)

      * json:pretty - Pretty JSON (requires JSON::MaybeXS)

      * json - JSON (requires JSON::MaybeXS)

      * table - Table (requires Text::Table::Any)

      * tsv - Tab-separated values (requires Text::CSV)

      * yaml - YAML (requires YAML)

      * FORMAT - Custom format (see below)

 Format string

    You can specify a custom format using printf-like format sequences.
    These are the items that can be substituted:

      * %F - Filename

      * %O - Owner or owners

      * %P - Project

      * %T - Pattern

      * %n - newline

      * %t - tab

      * %% - percent sign

    The syntax also allows padding and some filters. Examples:

        git-codeowners show -f ' * %-50F %O'                # default for "show"
        git-codeowners show -f '%{quote}F,%{quote}O'        # ad hoc CSV
        git-codeowners patterns -f '--> %{color:0c0}T'      # whatever...

    Available filters:

      * quote - Quote the replacement string.

      * color:FFFFFF - Colorize the replacement string (if color is ON).

      * nocolor - Do not colorize replacement string.

 Format table

    Table formatting can be done by one of several different modules, each
    with its own features and bugs. The default module is
    Text::Table::Tiny, but this can be overridden using the PERL_TEXT_TABLE
    environment variable if desired, like this:

        PERL_TEXT_TABLE=Text::Table::HTML git-codeowners -f table

    The list of available modules is at "@BACKENDS" in Text::Table::Any.

CAVEATS

      * Some commands require git (at least version 1.8.5).
