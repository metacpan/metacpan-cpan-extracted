<h2>Introduction</h2>
Genezzo is a relational database written in Perl currently under development.
Jeffrey Cohen is the lead developer.  The 
<a href="http://www.genezzo.com">www.genezzo.com</a>
web site presents the long-term
vision for the system, while the current code is hosted on 
<a href="http://www.cpan.org">CPAN</a> (Comprehensive Perl Archive Network) at
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Genezzo/">
http://search.cpan.org/dist/Genezzo/</a>.
The Clustered Genezzo code is at
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Genezzo-Contrib-Clustered/">
http://search.cpan.org/dist/Genezzo-Contrib-Clustered/</a>.
<p>
Currently Genezzo is a single-process database -- 
only one process on a single server may access the
database files at a time.  The current Genezzo codebase also does not
implement transaction rollback of data already written to disk.  
The Clustered Genezzo project
will add support for multi-server multi-process access.  
The multi-process support
will be specifically designed to support shared data clusters.
Transaction rollback support will also be added.  These additions will
be done via Genezzo's Havok and SysHook extension mechanisms, so
little modification of the base code will be necessary.
<p>
This implementation of Clustered Genezzo will rely heavily on two outside
components: a Cluster File System and a Distributed Lock Manager.
Initial choices for these components have been made to enable development.
It is expected these components will later be replaced, either with other
outside components or with new components developed as part of the
Clustered Genezzo project.
<p>
The remainder of this document discusses the details of the design and
proposed implementation of Clustered Genezzo.  Many notes detail alternative
design decisions and places for further improvement.
<h2>Shared Data Clusters</h2>
A shared data cluster consists of multiple independent servers sharing a
set of common disk drives over a network.  In a production deployment
the disk sharing will be done over a separate network from the one
used for general communications between the servers and clients.  
Until recently this
separate Storage Area Network (SAN) was assembled using expensive
Fibre Channel network adapters and switches.  Recently it has become
possible to assemble a SAN using standard ethernet adapters and switches.
<p>
A shared data cluster with a topology like that shown below 
provides numerous benefits when deploying an
application like the Genezzo database.   These benefits are in the
areas of scalability, high availability, and  most
recently affordability.  Several of these benefits arise because 
every server can equally access every shared disk.
The cluster scales in compute power by adding servers, and
in capacity by adding disks.   The data stored by the
cluster is highly available because single
server failures don't prevent access to any of the data, and because the SAN
disks can easily be set up in a RAID configuration to guard against
disk failures.
Finally, clusters built with commodity AMD/Intel processors,
ATA/SATA hard drives, and ethernet adapters and switches are
very affordable.  The major drawback to shared data clusters is the
greater complexity of the operating system(s) and applications required
to utilize it.  The holy grail at both
the operating system and database level is the "single system image" &#0150;
the illusion presented to the higher level applications and the users that
the cluster is a single monolithic system and the underlying hardware
complexity can safely be ignored.

<h2>Cluster File System</h2>
When a disk is directly shared between multiple servers a cluster file system
is normally needed to arbitrate access to prevent file system corruption.
Cluster file systems such as Red Hat's
<a href="http://sources.redhat.com/cluster/gfs/">
Global File System (GFS)</a>,
<a href="http://opengfs.sourceforge.net/">OpenGFS</a>, and 
<a href="http://oss.oracle.com/projects/ocfs/">
Oracle Cluster File System (OCFS)</a> are available for Linux, but
none appear ready to run on Debian with a 2.6 kernel.  When running
on a cluster the Genezzo database system will maintain its own
buffer cache, manage its own free space and metadata
storage, and provide its own distributed locking facilities
(initially using 
<a href="http://opendlm.sourceforge.net/">OpenDLM</a>).
Thus it can instead run on Linux raw devices.  Here a whole disk
partition acts as a single file.  The disk is read and written
directly, bypassing the kernel's block buffer cache.  This also
eliminates fsync problems where blocks are cached in the kernel
instead of written immediately to disk.  The downside is that
raw devices are much more primitive to maintain than file
system devices.  Clustered Oracle initially ran on raw devices
but they later created OCFS to ease the maintenance headaches.
GFS and/or OCFS may be integrated into the Linux kernel in
a later release, and Genezzo could run on these file systems.
<p>
The configuration of the Genezzo test cluster is discussed at
<a href="http://eric_rollins.home.mindspring.com/genezzo/cluster.html">
http://eric_rollins.home.mindspring.com/genezzo/cluster.html</a>.
<p>
One major concern with any file system will be the implementation of the 
<i>fsync</i>
system call.  When implementing database transactions it is
important to guarantee data has really been written to disk.  <i>fsync</i>
is used to force all cached data to disk.  When buffers are passed between
processes on different machines via the disk 
another process may read an inconsistent block due
to a partially completed write.  
This is very possible when database blocks are larger
than file system blocks.  We can detect this failure case using a checksum,
and the block will be reread if a mismatch
is found.
<h2>Distributed Lock Manager</h2>
Cluster File Systems allow processes on multiple machines to simultaneously
read and write the same file.  Without some form of arbitration a shared
database file would quickly become corrupted.  A Distributed Lock Manager
provides locking services to perform this arbitration.  For initial 
development Clustered Genezzo will utilize 
<a href="http://opendlm.sourceforge.net/">OpenDLM</a>.  OpenDLM was 
originally started by IBM, and is apparently currently being used by
Computer Associates for Ingres on Linux.  
There are questions about OpenDLMs completeness and
stability.  Red Hat rejected the IBM DLM and is writing their own
<a href="http://sources.redhat.com/cluster/dlm/">DLM</a>.  It can
be used independently of Red Hat GFS, but it isn't clear whether it only
operates on SAN or shared-disk hardware.
<p>
In the past clustered databases (such as Oracle Parallel Server or RAC) 
have been implemented utilizing one
database instance per machine, where each instance has its own internal
lock manager.  With row level locking the lock information has been
stored directly in the data blocks with the rows.  The DLM has been
used to implement cache coherence between database instances on different
machines, not database transaction-level locks.  In our case we will not
initially be implementing a separate instance-level (intra-machine) lock
manager.  Instead the DLM will provide all locking services 
even if only a single machine is running.
<p>
Early tests of OpenDLM's scalability have found it to run out of locks
at around 360,000 locks.  Only 350MB out of 1GB memory had been consumed,
so the issue was not simple memory exhaustion.  
Initially
we will restrict our usage to 100,000 locks.  This would restrict the size
of an update or select to 400MB, assuming a 4K database page size.  
We will instead hash the
lock names into a space of 100,000 locks, 
trading off 
the possibility of false lock blocking
for larger potential update size.  
<p>
There may also be issues with the
performance of OpenDLM.  In testing it took 1.9 seconds to obtain
10,000 locks, or 5263 locks/second.  In the 100,000 lock limit case
above it would take 19 seconds to lock the entire database.  This
is probably acceptable.
<p>
While OpenDLM provides many complex locking services, we will initially
utilize a very simple set.  We will not utilize the async APIs, avoiding
issues with callback synchronization in Perl.  By utilizing a simple set
it should be easier to move to a different DLM (or write our own) in the 
future.
<h2>Overall Architecture</h2>
Clustered Genezzo will consist of many identical server processes
running on multiple server machines.  Each machine will have multiple
server processes.  Server processes are not multi-threaded, so each one
will only service one request at a time.  Each server process maintains
its own private buffer cache.
Database data files will be stored on SAN attached disks.
Genezzo server
processes never communicate directly with one another.  They only interact
via data stored in the Cluster File System and lock requests using
the Distributed Lock Manager.
<p>
Each Genezzo process is started with a globally unique process id.
Currently it is allocated by requesting a lock [SVR-processid] in 
exclusive nowait mode, and incrementing the processid and retrying
if the processid is already in use (this N^2 technique may need to be
revisited with a large number of processes).
All processes share a single undo file, but have distinct
ranges of blocks preallocated to each process.  
Only the owning process reads or writes its
portion of the undo file.  
<p>
The undo file lists the current status of each process (CLEAR, COMMITTED,
ROLLEDBACK, PENDING) with one block per process.  A range of blocks per
process lists filenumber-blocknumber pairs.  These are the blocks written
to by the current transaction.  Before the data block is written the
before image is copied to the tail of its associated data file to a slot
at filelength + blocknum.
<p>
Blocks written by a process but not yet committed contain the process id.
When a process failure occurs
block locks will be released.  If a block is read containing another
process id the state of the failed process is read and the block
is replaced with the before image if necessary.
<p>
Note only before-images of blocks are being generated, 
and they are only being retained for the duration of the transaction.
No long-lived redo or log file is generated.  Cluster-wide recovery with
multiple redo log files is quite complex, and it is believed may 
customers cannot accept the downtime implied in a restore-backups + 
mount-offline-logs + roll-logs-forward style recovery.  Instead we will
rely on the availability of cheap SATA RAID hardware to cover the media failure
case.  Simple process death or power failure is covered in the undo file
scheme. 
<p>
An online hot-backup facility can be added via a tablespace or cluster-wide
lock which must be held in SHARED mode to enable writes to the tablespace.
A backup process would obtain it in EXCLUSIVE mode, locking out all writers
for the duration of the backup.  
<p>
Alternately all transactions could be streamed to a remote log server.  This
is similar to how many databases accomplish replication.
<p>
<h2>Block Structure</h2>
The basic Clustered Genezzo data block structure is as follows:
<pre>
   blockType
   fileNumber
   blockNumber
   currentProcess  (or none)
   ...metadata...
   ...row data..
   checksum
</pre>
<p>
If <i>currentProcess</i> is not <i>none</i> 
a transaction is in progress against this
block, and this block has been modified.  
<i>currentProcess</i> indicates the slot in the undo file
which contains
a commit record if the transaction was committed.  In this case 
<i>currentProcess</i> can safely be set to <i>none</i>.  Otherwise the transaction
has been rolled back, and the current block needs to be replaced with the
before image from the tail of the data file.
<p>
Note no global System Commit
Number or Log Sequence Number is maintained.  This eliminates the need
for this type of global sequence generation algorithm.  
<h2>Normal Transaction Operation</h2>
At the beginning of a normal transaction the process's undo file status block
will be set to clear.
The buffer cache will not contain any
valid blocks, and no locks will be held except an EXCLUSIVE lock on the
undo file [SVR-processId].  Note the buffer cache is only used
to manage database data blocks.  The undo file is managed separately.
<p>
As SQL statements are processed blocks will be requested from the
buffer cache.  Each request will form a lock name [BLK-fileNumber-blockNumber].
The process will determine whether this block is already locked by the
process.  If not, a blocking SHARED mode lock request will be made.
<pre>
def blockReadRequest(fileNumber, blockNumber)
   form lock name [BLK-blockNumber mod 100000]

   if(not lock already held by process)
      blocking SHARED lock request
      add lock to hash and list of locks held by process
   end

   checksumMatch = false
   retries = 0

   // all block reads follow this checksum-retry logic;
   // it is only listed here
   while(not checksumMatch and retries < maxRetryCount)
      read block from disk
      compute checksumMatch for block
   end

   if(retries >= maxRetryCount)
      raise BlockCorruptionException
   end

   if(block PID not none (and not current process!))
      promote block lock to EXCLUSIVE
      // Safe to read state, since we were able to obtain EX block lock
      get process state for PID 

      if state == COMMITTED
         update block to clear PID
         write updated block to before image tail of file
         write updated block to file
      else if state == ROLLEDBACK || state == PENDING
         replace block with before image from tail of file
      end
   end

   proceed with regular read
end
</pre>

The Genezzo push-hash implementation automatically detects any attempts to
write to a block.  The first time a block is written in a transaction
the SHARED lock must be promoted to EXCLUSIVE and the old contents of the
block must be written to the undo file.
<pre>
def blockWriteRequest(fileNumber, blockNumber)
   if(block on list of those already written to undo)
      return
   end

   form lock name 
   find lock in hash of locks held by process
   
   if(not lock already held by process in EXCLUSIVE mode)
      blocking EXCLUSIVE lock conversion request
      update local record of lock state
   end

   append current (old) contents of block to tail of data file
   <i>fsync</i> data file
   add fileno-blockno to process undo block in undo file 
      (written to two blocks for recoverability).
   <i>fsync</i> undo file

   current process id will be added to PID in metadata portion of block
      prior to its being written out to disk
end
</pre>
At this point the block may be updated and safely written out to disk at any 
time by the buffer cache.  It may LRU in and out of the buffer cache 
repeatedly, so we do support updates larger than the buffer cache.
<p>
At commit time the buffer cache must be written out to disk (same as
single-process Genezzo).  Then the process status in the undo file is set
to Committed.
Each of the updated data blocks now has the currentUndo field set to none.
Finally the undo file is truncated (set to empty), and the locks are released.
<pre>
def commit()
   write all dirty buffer cache buffers to disk
   <i>fsync</i> data file(s)
   write Committed status to process slot in undo file
   <i>fsync</i> undo file

   // At this point we have now persistently marked the transaction as
   // COMMITTED.  Prior to this point recovery will roll back the
   // transaction.  After this point recovery will complete the transaction.

   read undo slots in undo file  sequentially to determine list of updated blocks:

   for each block listed in undo slots
      read block
      update block to clear PID
      write updated block to before image tail of file
      write updated block to file
   end

   <i>fsync</i> data file(s)
   write CLEAR status to process slot in undo file
   <i>fsync</i> undo file
   free all data buffers
   release all locks in lock list
end
</pre>
In the case of a rollback we can use the undo file to back out the changes:
<pre>
def rollback()
   write ROLLEDBACK status to process slot in undo file
   <i>fsync</i> undo file

   invalidate buffer cache

   for each block listed in undo slots in undo file
      write block from data file tail to corresponding data file location
   end

   <i>fsync</i> data file(s)
   write CLEAR status to process slot in undo file
   <i>fsync</i> undo file
   release all locks in lock list
end
</pre>
<h2>Process Recovery</h2>
Process recovery is performed at startup.  
<p>
<pre>
def recoverProcess()   
   committed = FALSE

   lookup process status of failed process
  
   if COMMITTED status found
      committed = TRUE
   end

   for each block listed in undo slots of failed process
      lock block SHARED 

      if PID in block != current process id
        continue  // block already recovered by some other process

      promote lock to EXCLUSIVE

      if committed
         read block
         update block to clear PID
         write updated block to before image tail of file
         write updated block to file
      else
         write block from data file tail to corresponding data file location
      end

      release lock (or wait till end)
   end

   <i>fsync</i> data file(s)
   write CLEAR status to process slot of failed process in undo file   
   <i>fsync</i> undo file
   return TRUE
end
</pre>
<h2>Deadlock</h2>
Deadlock is detected by the Distributed Lock Manager OpenDLM.  The DLM chooses
a victim and returns an error code.  It is the responsibility of the
caller to release all locks and return an error (exception?) to the
higher level routine.  All lock requests in Clustered Genezzo must
be written to handle this condition.
<h2>Space Management Transactions</h2>
Blocks used to manage space allocation in tablespaces will have
high degrees of write contention.  
Currently Genezzo stores the table directory and free space directory
for each tablespace in block 0.  This prevents any concurrency between
reads and writes.  One solution would involve moving distinct functions to
different blocks and allocating multiple blocks of each type.  The block number
of the first
block of each table could be stored directly 
in the data dictionary, and free extent
lists could be maintained in multiple blocks at the beginning of the file.  
Processes hashed by PID would begin their search for a free extent in
different blocks.  Extents could be linked together to prevent contention
over used extent maps.
<p>
We currently don't have any facility to support separate space management
transactions.  If a user transaction rolls back for any reason the nested space
management transaction also rolls back.  Space management transactions
cannot commit prior to the user transaction commit.
<h2>Data Dictionary</h2>
At startup (before Havok routines are loaded) data dictionary tables
are loaded and cached.  These blocks are not released on commit,
and aren't visible to the lock manager.  Other machines won't be
notified of changes.  We may only support distributed transactions
against the non-system tablespace.  The data dictionary would remain
in the system tablespace and would be cacheable.  Currently the
data dictionary is written when a table spills into another file of its
tablespace, so the data dictionary is not read-only for DML.
<h2>Performance</h2>
The current Clustered Genezzo design has many areas of concern with
respect to performance.  Several are related to the buffer cache
not being able to perform its usual functions.  In a shared-memory or
multi-threaded server the buffers are shared between many user requests.
This minimizes the necessary disk access and maximizes the use of memory.
In Clustered Genezzo we may wish to support hundreds of users on a single
server, but this means the available server memory would be 
divided between all the processes.  An individual server process would
have a very small buffer cache.  The alternative would be to implement a
true shared-memory buffer cache, or a set of easily reservable buffers
from a shared pool for use on large queries.  
<p>
The second major buffer cache difficulty is that currently
the cache must be invalidated on completion of each transaction, since all
the locks are released.  One alternative is to store the blockRevisionNumber
in the Lock Value Block (a 32-byte user-defined field) provided by OpenDLM.
If the value matched the blockRevisionNumber in the buffer cache a read
could be avoided.  However, writing a new value requires upgrading the lock
to EXCLUSIVE mode, which would be difficult with blocks under high 
contention.  The lock would also need to be down-converted to NULL mode
rather than released, so the DLM will preserve the value.  Finally,
with hashing of locks the lock name would also need to be written in the
value field and only one value could be retained in a hash-collision case.
A second option is to have the server processes retain locks after committing,
and instead only release locks when an async callback occurs requesting
the lock.  This would require async callback programming in Perl.
<p>
File system performance will be strongly influenced by the implementation of
the underlying Cluster File System.  If it is built directly on raw devices
there will not be any other file system buffering, and all reads will
hit the disk (or disk cache).  Cluster file systems build on top of the
operating system file system
have additional levels of buffer cache.
These levels of cache reduce the need for a large Genezzo buffer cache,
but introduce a greater likelihood of <i>fsync</i> problems.  
<p>
Performance will also be impacted by the lack of serial writes.  
Traditional enterprise databases have one dedicated disk per database
server log.  This way each server can perform serial writes.
They also perform write-ahead in the log and minimize <i>fsyncs</i> of
the data files.
We have a single random-accessed undo file shared between all 
processes on all servers.
A dedicated undo disk per process would be cost prohibitive.
<h2>Proposed Server Model</h2>
We are currently investigating utilizing the 
<a href="http://httpd.apache.org">Apache Web Server</a> 
running 
<a href="http://perl.apache.org">mod_perl</a> as the
multi-process server for Genezzo.  A simple mod_perl script would
receive HTTP requests and return XML results.  Here it would be
acting as a XML-over-HTTP web service.  It would be connectionless from
the web-service user's point of view, but would hold the database files
open.  Apache 1.3, and 2.0 in pre-fork MPM mode, creates multiple 
single-threaded server processes.  Each process handles one request at
a time.  Each would be a separate process for the purposes of the previous
design -- each would have its own portion of the undo file with its
process id.  Apache web servers on multiple machines would all access the
same Genezzo database files available through the Cluster File System.
<p>
A minimal Apache 2.0 process (with mod_perl) consumes 6 MB [need to verify
with code sharing, etc.].  
The Genezzo code is small, and the total process size will be primarily
determined by the size of the buffer cache.  With a 4 MB buffer cache
the total process would be 10 MB, and a 1 GB server could have say 80
Apache Genezzo child processes running.  This is small compared to the
hundreds of user connections supported by commercial databases, but the
difference is that we are using a stateless web protocol instead of
persistent connections.  If a user makes small simple requests and
waits tens of seconds between them then
a single Apache process can serve dozens of users.  
<p>
Note the stateless protocol means user transactions cannot span multiple HTTP
requests.  Instead some type of server-side stored procedures will be
required to bundle multiple SQL statements into a single transaction.
Stored procedures would of course be written in Perl.
A simple alternative is to create separate mod_perl web pages for each
procedure.  They could be shared between the Apache servers in the cluster via
the Cluster File System.  Another alternative is to store the 
procedure definitions in the database.
Large bulk loads
would need to be done using a command-line tool (similar to gendba.pl).
<h2>Read Consistency Model</h2>
The preceding design specifies lock modes (Shared for read, Exclusive
for write) and 
how long locks will be held (until the completion of the transaction).
This is an instance of two-phase locking, and implements the "Serializable"
isolation level.  An alternative is to release share locks at on the 
completion of each SQL select instead of the completion of the transaction.
This would implement the "Cursor Stability" isolation level.  In this
case we would need to extend the SQL grammar with "holdlock" or 
"for update" when locks should be retained until the completion of the
transaction.  The "Cursor Stability" isolation level (named for 
cursors, which we don't support) may not be as necessary given
the short-transaction model imposed by the proposed Apache server model,
above.
<p>
With the locking model described above we still have the potential for
"Phantoms".  To prevent phantoms in indexed tables we can acquire additional
locks on the index pages in positions before or after 
where phantom rows would be inserted.  Preventing phantoms in non-indexed
columns is more difficult.
