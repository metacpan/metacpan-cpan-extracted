1.06  2017-04-17T18:08:00
	- Fix typo in Makefile.PL where I specified File::Slurper V 0.0098 but meant V 0.009.

1.05  2016-09-14T17:34:00

1.04  Mon Nov 16 09:56:00 2015
	- Remove EO::Array from config/module.list.ini because it won't install. This means it is no
		longer included in any reports.
	- Add Set::Equivalence in module.list.ini, but don't try to test its features.
	- Convert from Hash::FieldHash to Moo.
	- Convert from Perl6::Slurp to File::Slurper.

	- Update pre-reqs in Makefile.PL.
	- Chop benchmarks copied from docs for Set::Tiny.
	- Re-create html/setops.report.html.

1.02  Thu May 24 13:18:00 2012
	- Update pre-reqs in Build.PL and Makefile.PL.
		Various Set::* modules are not included. To run scripts/symmetric.demo.pl, install
		Set::Array, Set::Scalar and Set::Tiny manually.
