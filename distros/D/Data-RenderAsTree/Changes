Revision history for Perl extension Data::RenderAsTree.

1.04  2025-05-12T17:00:00
	- Rewrite scripts/* and t/* to handle most recent Tree::DAG_Node (V 1.35), to handle
		node and node data being '' (empty string), undef or 0 (zero).
	- Add new test t/zero.t and script scripts/zero.pl.
		The point of these 9 plain scripts is so you can use them without having to fiddle about
		removing the test code in the corresponding test scripts.
	- Add .gitignore, UltraEdit files and Data-RenderAsTree-.* to MANIFEST.SKIP.
	- Update Makefile.PL

1.03  2015-07-12T17:01:00
	- Remove the max_key_length and max_value_length options from t/ref.t so truncation of strings
		does not cause tests to fail. Also, scripts/ref.pl has been changed to match.

1.02  2015-07-06T12:43:00
	- Add method run(), which does not call tree2string() automatically the way render() does.
		run() is used by MarpaX::Languages::Lua::Parser.
	- Add option clean_nodes() to stop undef warnings when printing via tree2string().

1.01  2015-03-16T12:44:00
	- Remove scripts/data.tree.dumper.pl, which required the dread Data::TreeDumper.

1.00  2015-03-07TT17:12:00
