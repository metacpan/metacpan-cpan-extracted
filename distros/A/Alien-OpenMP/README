NAME
    Alien::OpenMP - Encapsulate system info for OpenMP

SYNOPSIS
        use Alien::OpenMP;
        say Alien::OpenMP->cflags;       # e.g. '-fopenmp' if gcc
        say Alien::OpenMP->lddlflags;    # e.g. '-fopenmp' if gcc
        say Alien::OpenMP->auto_include; # e.g. '#include <omp.h>' if gcc

DESCRIPTION
    This module encapsulates the knowledge required to compile OpenMP
    programs $Config{ccname}. "C", "Fortran", and "C++" programs annotated
    with declarative OpenMP pragmas will still compile if the compiler (and
    linker if this is a separate process) is not passed the appropriate flag
    to enable OpenMP support. This is because all pragmas are hidden behind
    full line comments (with the addition of OpenMP specific "sentinels", as
    they are called).

    All compilers require OpenMP to be explicitly activated during
    compilation; for example, GCC's implementation, "GOMP", is invoked by
    the "-fopenmp" flag.

    Most major compilers support OpenMP, including: GCC, Intel, IBM,
    Portland Group, NAG, and those compilers created using LLVM. GCC's
    OpenMP implementation, "GOMP", is available in all modern versions.
    Unfortunately, while OpenMP is a well supported standard; compilers are
    not required to use the same commandline switch to activate support. All
    compilers that support OpenMP use slightly different ways of invoking
    it.

  Compilers Supported by this module
    At this time, the following compilers are supported:

    "gcc"
        "-fopenmp" enables OpenMP support in via compiler and linker:

            gcc -fopenmp ./my-openmp.c -o my-openmp.x

    "clang" EXPERIMENTAL
        "-fopenmp" enables OpenMP support via compiler and linker in recent
        versions of "clang". MacOS shipped versions are missing the library
        which needs installing either with Homebrew <https://brew.sh> or
        Macports <https://www.macports.org>.

  Note On Compiler Support
    If used for an unsupported compiler,
    "ExtUtils::MakeMaker::os_unsupported" is invoked, which results an
    exception propagating from this method being raised with the value of
    "qq{OS unsupported\n}" (note the new line).

    This module assumes that the compiler in question is the same one used
    to build "perl". Since the vast majority of "perl"s are building using
    "gcc", initial support is targeting it. However, like "perl", many other
    compilers may be used.

    Adding support for a new compiler should be straightforward; please
    section on contributing, below.

  Contributing
    The biggest need is to support additional compilers. OpenMP is a well
    established standard across compilers, but there is no guarantee that
    all compilers will use the same flags, library names, or header files.
    It should also be easy to contribute a patch to add this information,
    which is effectively its purpose. At the very least, please create an
    issue at the official issue tracker to request this support, and be sure
    to include the relevant information. Chances are the maintainers of this
    module do not have access to an unsupported compiler.

METHODS
    "cflags"
       Returns flag used by a supported compiler to enable OpenMP. If not
       support, an empty string is provided since by definition all OpenMP
       programs must compile because OpenMP pragmas are annotations hidden
       behind source code comments.

       Example, GCC uses, "-fopenmp".

    "lddlflags"
       Returns the flag used by the linker to enable OpenMP. This is usually
       the same as what is returned by "cflags".

       Example, GCC uses, "-fopenmp", for this as well.

    "Inline"
       Used in support of Inline::C's "with" method (inherited from Inline).
       This method is not called directly, but used when compiling OpenMP
       programs with "Inline::C":

           use Alien::OpenMP; use Inline (
               C           => 'DATA',
               with        => qw/Alien::OpenMP/,
           );

       The nice, compact form above replaces this mess:

           use Alien::OpenMP; use Inline (
               C             => 'DATA',
               ccflagsex     => Alien::OpenMP->cflags(),
               lddlflags     => join( q{ }, $Config::Config{lddlflags}, Alien::OpenMP::lddlflags() ),
               auto_include => Alien::OpenMP->auto_include(),
           );

       It also means that the standard *include* for OpenMP is not required
       in the "C" code, i.e., "#include <omp.h>".
