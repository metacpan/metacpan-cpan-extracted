NAME

    CPAN::02Packages::Search - Search packages in 02packages.details.txt

SYNOPSIS

      use CPAN::02Packages::Search;
    
      my $index = CPAN::02Packages::Search->new(file => '/path/to/02packages.details.txt');
    
      my $result1 = $index->search('Plack'); # { version => "1.0048", path => "M/MI/MIYAGAWA/Plack-1.0048.tar.gz" }
      my $result2 = $index->search('Does_Not_Exist'); # undef

DESCRIPTION

    CPAN::02Packages::Search allows you to search packages in the de facto
    standard CPAN index file 02packages.details.txt.

MOTIVATION

    We can already search packages in 02packages.details.txt by the
    excellent module CPAN::Common::Index::Mirror. Its functionality is not
    only searching packages, but also searching authors and even
    fetching/caching index files.

    As an author of CPAN clients, I just want to search packages in
    02packages.details.txt. So I ended up extracting functionality of
    searching packages from CPAN::Common::Index::Mirror as
    CPAN::02Packages::Search.

PERFORMANCE

    CPAN::Common::Index::Mirror and CPAN::02Packages::Search use
    Search::Dict, which implements binary search. A simple benchmark shows
    that CPAN::02Packages::Search is 422 times faster than naive search.

      ❯ perl bench/bench.pl
                     Rate naive_search   our_search
      naive_search 4.13/s           --        -100%
      our_search   1752/s       42291%           --
