Test-Trap

Primarily (but not exclusively) for use in test scripts: A block eval
on steroids, configurable and extensible, but by default trapping
(Perl) STDOUT, STDERR, warnings, exceptions, would-be exit codes, and
return values from boxed blocks of test code.

INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test
  sudo make install

(If you are running as root, you may drop "sudo", and just run "make install".)

Alternatively, for those without a proper make, the Module::Build approach:

  perl Build.PL
  perl Build
  perl Build test
  sudo perl Build install

(Again, if you are running as root, you may run "make install" without "sudo".)
