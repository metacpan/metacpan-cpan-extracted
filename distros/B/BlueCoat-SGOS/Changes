------------------------
+ Much better parsing of VPM-CPL and VPM-XML files.
+ Addition of vpmcpl() and vpmxml() methods to return respective data.
+ Update documentation, particularly around the sections that can

+ Updated example script now includes date/time of the sysinfo.

0.92    2010-05-06

0.94    2010-10-10
------------------------
+ Refactored into BlueCoat::SGOS

0.95    2011-11-11
------------------------
+ Removed support and tests for SGOS 4.x.
+ Added a new get_sysinfo_from_data method to parse sysinfo that
  already exists in a data structure.
+ Added an internal-only function to parse the last hardware
  and software reboot times.
+ Parsing of the uptime is now also returned in seconds since
  the epoch.

1.00    2012-02-28
------------------------
+ Updated methods to capture sysinfo data.  It is no longer necessary
  to connect to the Blue Coat ProxySG to retrieve the realm name to
  pass back to the LWP::UserAgent constructor.  Instead, the username
  and password are passed directly to the initial connection to the
  device.  This saves a round trip to the device.
+ Added a new method to send commands to the ProxySG.  It is name
  send_command and takes a scalar containing commands to be run
  on the ProxySG.
+ Updated the module to no longer automatically parse the sysinfo file.
  This is necessary if you only want the sysinfo file.
+ Added a capture.pl example script to the examples directory.  This script
  takes the sysinfo from a remote device and saves in on the local
  filesystem with a timestamp.
+ Updated copyright.

1.01    2012-07-09 19:22
------------------------
+ Added the ability to use Build.PL to install the distribution, to be
  more friendly for non-Unix systems.
+ Updated copyright to be GPL v2 only.
+ Testing is now more aggressive.

1.02    2012-07-15 20:21
------------------------
+ Updated documentation for send_command.  You're already in configuration mode,
  so it's not necessary to use 'conf t' before running commands.
+ Updated prerequisite build modules (Test::NoWarnings).

1.03    2012-07-19 22:22
------------------------
+ Standardized test suites, using -T where possible.

1.04    2013-03-16 18:02
