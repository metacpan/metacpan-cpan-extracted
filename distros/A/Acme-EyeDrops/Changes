	- Bug fix release for Perl 5.8.1 (see Perl bug #23143).
	- For the first time, the EyeDrops test suite uncovered a Perl bug
	  (dance a little jig): recur.t, test 4 failed on Perl 5.8.1-RC2
	  with the error: panic: pad_free curpad. Thanks merlyn for reporting.

	- documentation: added 'twang bra-strap' to acme shape description
	- tests: merged old 13_to.t, old 12_Beer.t to new 19_surrounds.t
	         new Test::Pod test, 18_sky.t
	         11_bold.t now tested in taint mode (no banner test)

1.44	Sun Apr 25 19:07:41 2004

	- Bug fix release for Perl 5.8.4: some of the tests broke because
	  they were naughtily exploiting a Perl bug re use strict inside

	- pod coverage: documented slurp_yerself()
	- tests: improved the ugly test suite a little
	     new test: 16_astride.t simple threads test

	     added Regex => 0 tests to 05_Parrot.t

	- tests: added new test to 05_Parrot.t
	- Build.PL: simplified for Module::Build 0.26 and above

	  robots from using Build.PL (got a lot of unexplained failures
	  with v1.46, yet they worked fine when installed manually)

	  02_shatters.t (tests 2-4) and 09_Gallop.t (tests 3-6)
	  both failed on Perl 5.10.0 with "Out of memory!".
	  Workaround for now by commenting out these tests.
	  Need to investigate further and perlbug to P5P.
	- new shape: jon_oxer (thanks pjf)
	- fixed META.yml to comply with its latest spec (1.3) at
	  http://module-build.sourceforge.net/META-spec-current.html

1.53	Wed July 16 18:17:16 2008

	- new shape: debian (thanks Richard Hartmann)
	- new shape property keyword: debian
	- CPAN testers report occasional failures in test 01_mug
	  on Perl 5.10.0 with "Out of memory!". Don't know why.
	  Requires further investigation. Meanwhile, I'll try commenting
	  out parts of this test and see if the failures disappear.

1.54	Sun August 31 21:19:04 2008

	- new shape: opera (thanks Cosimo)
	- new shape: kangaroo

	- Dropped support for Perl 5.005; A::E now requires Perl 5.6 or higher
	- Clarified Acme::EyeDrops license (thanks Jotam Jr. Trejo)
	    LICENSE and README were inconsistent with META.yml
	    all should be consistent now

	- documentation: added new "Victoria Bra, Secret Tango" section
	- new shape: bra
	- new shape: spider
	- 01_mug.t: fixed rt #72163: perl -Mstrict -e 'open$['
	  'Can't use string ("0") as a symbol ref while "strict refs" in use'
	  This seems to be a long-standing perl bug fixed in 5.16
	  Fixed test simply by removing -Mstrict in 01_mug.t
	- 16_astride.t: threads test, adjusted to avoid annoying
	  "Tests out of sequence" failure reports from CPAN testers

1.61	Mon May 20 21:59:42 2013

	- Bug fix release for Perl 5.18.0
	- Tragically, perl 5.18 requires a leading "use re 'eval'"
	  if you embed the program in a regex. To appease this change
	  in behavior, the Regex attribute now supports three different
	  "true" values:
	   1: add a leading "use re 'eval';" for Perl 5.18+ only
	   2: do not add a leading "use re 'eval';"
	   3: add a leading "use re 'eval';"
	- Updated test suite to work with new Regex attribute
	- Updated sightly.pl to work with new Regex attribute
