NAME
    Dancer::Logger::Spinner - Show a spinner in the console on Dancer log
    messages!

VERSION
    version 0.02

SYNOPSIS
        # in your Dancer app:
        setting logger => 'spinner';

        # or in your Dancer config file:
        logger: 'spinner'

    Et voila!

DESCRIPTION
    When using this logger and running your application in the terminal, you
    will see a text spinner running on each message it gets. If you have a
    page with a lot of request, and they will come in fast, you'll see the
    spinner running. If you have an app with very little requests in each
    page or if it is slow, the spinner will run slowly.

    Each request matches another rotation of the spinner.

SUBROUTINES/METHODS
  init
    Sets the spinner's characters and position.

  advance_spinner
    Advanced the spinner onefold by cleaning a terminal line and printing
    the next spinner position.

  _log
    Gets a message to log and calls "advance_spinner".
