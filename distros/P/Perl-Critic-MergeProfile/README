NAME

    Perl::Critic::MergeProfile - merge multiple Perl::Critic profiles into
    one

VERSION

    Version 0.002

SYNOPSIS

        use Perl::Critic::MergeProfile;

        my $merge = Perl::Critic::MergeProfile->new;
        $merge->read('xt/author/perlcriticrc-base');
        $merge->read('xt/author/perlcriticrc-project');
        $merge->write('xt/author/perlcriticrc-merged');

DESCRIPTION

    Merges multiple Perl::Critic profiles into a single one.

    This allows to keep a common base profile for all projects but add
    project specific changes to the profile.

USAGE

 new

    Returns a new Perl::Critic::MergeProfile instance. Arguments to new are
    ignored.

 read( FILENAME, [ ENCODING ] )

    Calls read from Config::Tiny with the same arguments it was called.
    Please see the documentation for read of Config::Tiny for an
    explanation of the parameters.

    If no valid Config::Tiny object is returned an exception is thrown.

    If this is the first call to read or read_string, the returned
    Config::Tiny object is used as the base of the new merged profile. No
    checks are performed on this first profile object.

    Otherwise, the returned object is checked and if the same policy is
    enabled and disabled in this new profile an exception is thrown.

    After that, existing entries for this policy are removed from the base
    policy and a new entry either a disabled or enabled policy is added.

    Entries in the global section of this profile overwrite the existing
    entries with the same name in the global section.

 read_string( STRING )

    Behaves the same as read but calls read_string from Config::Tiny.

 write( FILENAME, [ ENCODING ] )

    An exception is thrown if no valid policy exists, because neither read
    nor read_string were successfully called at least once.

    Otherwise write from Config::Tiny is called on the profile with the
    same arguments write was called. Please see the documentation for write
    of Config::Tiny for an explanation of the parameters.

    Returns something true if on success and throws an exception otherwise.

 write_string

    Behaves the same as write but calls write_string from Config::Tiny.

    Returns the policy as string on success and throws an exception
    otherwise.

EXAMPLES

 Example 1 Test::Perl::Critic

    The following test script can be used to test your code with
    Perl::Critic with a merged profile.

        use 5.006;
        use strict;
        use warnings;

        use Test::More 0.88;
        use Perl::Critic::MergeProfile;

        eval {
            my $merge = Perl::Critic::MergeProfile->new;
            $merge->read('xt/author/perlcriticrc-base');
            $merge->read('xt/author/perlcriticrc-project');

            my $profile = $merge->write_string;

            require Test::Perl::Critic;
            Test::Perl::Critic->import(-profile => \$profile);
            1;
        } || do {
            my $error = $@;
            BAIL_OUT($error);
        };

        all_critic_ok();
