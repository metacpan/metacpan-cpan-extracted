NAME
    Web::Library::Bootstrap - Distribution wrapper around Bootstrap

SYNOPSIS
        my $library_manager = Web::Library->instance;
        $library_manager->mount_library({ name => 'Bootstrap' });

DESCRIPTION
    This is a distribution wrapper around Twitter Bootstrap. It enables you
    to include the client-side library in multiple Web application projects
    with very little effort. See Web::Library for the general concept and
    how to use it with Catalyst.

LIBRARY VERSIONS
    The following versions are available. For each version all included
    files are listed. Files marked with an asterisk are included in that
    versions' asset list - see Web::Library's "css_link_tags_for()" and
    "script_tags_for()" methods for an explanation of the concept.
