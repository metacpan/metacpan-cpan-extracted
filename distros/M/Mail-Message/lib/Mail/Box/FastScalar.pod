=head1 SYNOPSIS

  my $fh = Mail::Box::FastScalar->new;
  $fh->open(\my $out);

  my $fh = Mail::Box::FastScalar->new(\my $out);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Extremely fast IO::Scalar replacement - over 20x improvement in

Contributed by "Todd Richmond" (C<richmond@proofpoint.com>)

=head2 Warnings

You cannot modify the original reference between calls unless you
C<$obj->seek(1, 0)> to reset the object - VERY rare usage case.

$/ must be C<undef> or string - "" and \scalar unimplemented
