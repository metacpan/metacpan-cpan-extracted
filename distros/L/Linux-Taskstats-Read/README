Linux-Taskstats-Read version 6.01
=================================

This module reads a taskstats struct and puts it into a lovely hashref
for you to do whatever you want with it.

  my $ts = new Linux::Taskstats::Read( -file => '/some/taskstats.log', -ver => 4 );
  my $rec = $ts->read;
  $ts->close;
  print "Process name: " . $rec->{ac_comm} . "\n";

For more information about taskstats, see the 'SEE ALSO' section of
this module.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

DEPENDENCIES

Requires a 64-bit machine architecture for quad ('Q') template support
in unpack(). You should probably also make sure the 'reader' machine
has the same endian-ness as the machine producing the dump files.
