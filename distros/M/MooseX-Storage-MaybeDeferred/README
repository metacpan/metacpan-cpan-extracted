NAME
    MooseX::Storage::MaybeDeferred - A role for the less indecisive
    programmers

VERSION
    0.0.4

SYNOPSIS
        package Point;
        use Moose;
        use MooseX::Storage;

        with MooseX::Storage::MaybeDeferred => {
            default_format => 'JSON',
            default_io     => 'File',
        };

        has 'x' => (is => 'rw', isa => 'Int');
        has 'y' => (is => 'rw', isa => 'Int');

        1;

        my $p = Point->new();
        $p->freeze();
        # or
        $p->freeze({format => 'Storable'});

        ...

        $p->store($filename);
        $p->store($filename, {format => 'Storable', io => 'AtomicFile'});

        ...

        my $another_point;
        $another_point = Point->load($filename);
        # or
        $another_point = Point->load($filename, {format => 'JSON', io => 'File'});

DESCRIPTION
    With the module MooseX::Storage you are hard coding the definition of
    the "format" and maybe "io" layer in the classes you want to serialize.
    Whenever the methods "freeze" or "store" are called, it is not possible
    to to change their behaviour. You always get what you have declared.

    If you need to serialize into different formats you can use
    MooseX::Storage::Deferred. Now, whenever you call "freeze" or "store"
    you must provide parameters which define the format and the io layer.

    This module should give you the benefits of both worlds. You need to
    provide the "default_format" and "default_io" layers in the definitions
    of the classes which you want to serialize. So classes that used to use
    MooseX::Storage should still behave as before. But if you need to
    serialize into a different format you have the flexibility of
    MooseX::Storage::Deferred. Now you can provide the "format" and "io"
    setting at runtime.
