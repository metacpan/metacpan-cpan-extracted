Revision history for Tesla-API

1.01    2022-04-22
    - Unit test suite now has 90% coverage
    - _decode() is now an object method as opposed to a simple function
    - _api_attempts() now resets on a false value, and we reset it at the
      beginning of each call to _tesla_api_call()
    - useragent_string() and useragent_timeout() now set a flag that the mech()
      object needs to be re-instantiated, so changes are reflected in runtime
    - _tesla_api_call() now returns a hashref with error and displays a warning
      if all API_TIMEOUT_RETRIES get exhausted, instead of croaking

1.00    2022-04-19
    - This version is now deemed stable; The user-facing API calls will now
      remain consistent going forward
    - Each API cache object now contains the time it was stored. This allows
      each cache object to time out individually (fixes #10)
    - Added useragent_string() and useragent_timeout() (overrides constants)
    - Added new POD section detailing the constants/overrides
    - Fix issue in token validation where the token would always be classified
      as expired
    - All Tesla API calls are now routed through a new _tesla_api_call() method;
      accepts a $request, returns a $response. This allows all calls to route
      through the API retry functionality
    - Added _api_attempts(); returns the number of attempts we've made for each
      individual call to Tesla's API
    - Renamed _cache() to _api_cache()
    - Renamed CACHE_FILE to AUTH_CACHE_FILE
    - Added _authentication_cache_file() which allows changing the default
      AUTH_CACHE_FILE path to something custom (primarily for testing)
    - Moved call to _authentication_code() from _access_token() to
      _access_token_generate()
    - Rename _access_token_validate() to _access_token_valid()
    - _tesla_api_call() now returns $status, $code and
      $response->decoded_content
    - Add tests for nearly the entire authentication and access token routines
    - Add prereq of Mock::Sub for test suite
    - useragent_timeout() now croaks if timeout param isn't an int or float
    - Removed object_data(). Wasn't being used, and essentially just stored the
      api_cache() anyways
    - api_cache_time() croaks if an int isn't sent in
    - Added api_cache_data(), returns the entire API cache (primarily for
      testing)

0.10    2022-04-11
    - Remove erroneous call example from Tesla::Vehicle from the SYNOPSIS
    - Added prereq of LWP::Protocol::https
    - Remove WWW::Mechanize timeout (it defaults to 180 secs in LWP::UserAgent)
    - Add API_TIMEOUT_RETRIES; If a Tesla API call times out, try it again this
      many times
    - Accept PR #9 (fix compatibility with JSON < 4) and apply that change to
      all instances of encode_json()

0.09    2022-03-22
    - In CI script, manually install File::ShareDir::Install, as it doesn't get
      installed by default the way we configure the test run (was throwing "! No
      MYMETA file is found after configure. Your toolchain is too old?" error on
      the 'cpanm --installdeps .' command).
    - api() now requires all parameters sent in as a hash

0.08    2022-03-22
    - We now store endpoints.json and option_codes.json in a share directory
      with the library (closes #4)
    - Added update_data_files(), updates the endpoints.json and
      option_codes.json files this library uses if they have in fact been
      changed
    - Added option_codes

0.07    2022-03-21
    - POD corrections

0.06    2022-03-20
    - Made "API CACHE METHODS" section a head1 in POD

0.05    2022-03-20
    - DEBUG_API_CACHE now retrieved from $ENV{DEBUG_TESLA_API_CACHE} instead of
      having it as a magic number (so we don't accidentally publish the code
      with it set ;)
    - Make EXAMPLE POD section a head1; accidentally had it as a head2
    - Moved all cache methods in POD to their own METHOD section

0.04    2022-03-20
    - Fix issue where we were assigning to the wrong variable in
      api_cache_time()
    - Renamed $api_cache_time to $api_cache_alive_time to be non-ambiguous to
      the api_cache_time() method
    - Added api_cache_persist() and api_cache_persist param. Allows temporarily
      or permanently returning the cached Tesla API data
    - Added entire section in POD dealing exclusively with the API caching
      mechanism

0.03    2022-03-19
    - Added api_clear_cache() for methods that need to daisy chain calls, but
      require fresh data between them
    - Added ability to send in an additional param, $api_params to api(), so
      that we can send them to the API as JSON body content
      (eg. $vehicle->trunk_actuate with 'which_trunk' => 'rear');

0.02    2022-03-18
    - Removed all vehicle related stuff and moved it into a separate subclass
      distribution, Tesla::Vehicle. This distribution will only be for the
      managing of access tokens and speaking to the Tesla API directly
    - Cleaned up documentation about "id" param in new(). The children
      classes must take care of this
    - Added full blown caching mechanism to cache endpoint/id pair data for
      each call through the Tesla API (closes #3)
    - Access tokens now track their own expiry, and auto-refresh when needed
      (closes #2)

0.01    2022-03-16
    - Auto generated distribution with Dist::Mgr
    - Prompt user to authenticate via URL, and to paste new URL back into
      console
    - Auto generate access token, and stash home directory cache
    - Impemented api(), which will use endpoints() for all Tesla API calls
    - Implemented rudimentary vehicle ID handling
    - Implemented initial basic list of API functionality
    - Tesla API endpoints are stored in __DATA__ for the time being
