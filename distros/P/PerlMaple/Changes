= Changes for PerlMaple 0.07 (rev 51) - Nov 20, 2009

* applied the POD patch from Frank Wiegand.

= Changes for PerlMaple 0.06 (rev 48) - May 2, 2006

== Core Enhancements

* made warning messages issued by the Maple kernel controllable 
  (MAPLE_TEXT_WARNING no long directly goes to stderr, but stores 
  in a buffer controlled by PrintError)

= Changes for PerlMaple 0.05 (rev 46) - Feb 18, 2006

== Documents

* confirmed that PerlMaple works both with Maple 9.02 and 10.00
* added a note to both README and PerlMaple.pm's POD for this
* used Kwid to reformat this file (Changes). Kwid++
* added some new TODOs to POD

= Changes for PerlMaple 0.04 (rev 43) - Feb 6, 2006

== Core Enhancements

* rewrote PerlMaple::Expression's constructor and made its instances 
  rather "lazy". That is to say, PerlMaple::Expression now won't
  construct a whole AST at startup time. It only evaluate a specific 
  part of the AST on the user's *actual* demand. This is really a big
  win on performance. Yay!
* added internal methods `init_type' and `init_ops' to PerlMaple::Expression.
  They're only called on demand of the users.
* tweaked the tests a bit to remain to pass

== Documents

* updated the POD to reflect recent changes in core
* added more words for the Maplesoft and its Maple product in the POD
  (to help Google find this stuff)
* moved the VERSION section of the POD in PerlMaple.pm to the front of
  the bloated SYNOPSIS section
* replaced the ugly `-E<gt>error' and things like that with more elegant
  `C<error>' or so.

= Changes for PerlMaple 0.03 (rev 38) - Feb 5, 2006

== Core Enhancements

* changed the PerlMaple error message from "PerlMaple error: XXX" to
  "PerlMaple: XXX". Indeed "errors" always frighten poeple arway.
* added undocumented and also preliminary support for the LogCmd attribute
* when Maple returns outputs of the type MAPLE_TEXT_WARNING, PerlMaple 
  will warn it out instead of return the string as a return value to the
  Perl programmer. (I'm sure there must be better solutions to this kind
  of things. :=))
* fixed a bug concerning zero number of ops
* added AUTOLOAD mechanism to PerlMaple::Expression so it now autoloads 
  Maple functions just as PerrlMaple does, which is a big win in syntax!
  Added POD docs and some tests for this new feature.
* fixed a bug which manifest itself when a PerlMaple::Expression object
  is contructed using a Maple assignment statement (say, a command 
  containing ":=").
* added more info (the Maple command given) to the carp/croak messages 
  issued by PerlMaple. It really eases debugging process.
* improved the operator overloading mechanism so that PerlMaple::Expression
  objects behave like simple Perl scalar variables. Yeah, simplicity is
  the key, no extra magic is really needed.

== Documents

* updated my email address in POD to agentzh@gmail.com
* added new TODO on facilities that imports complex perl data structure
  to Maple land
* added one more interesting example to PerlMaple's SYNOPSIS to 
  demonstrate the elegant AUTOLOAD feature of PerlMaple::Expression.
* added BUGS sections to both PerlMaple and PerlMaple::Expression's POD,
  mostly about the sharing of Maple evaluation contexts among PerlMaple
  objects.
* updated the outdated "Inline::C" comment to "XS".
* fixed the indented L<> linking in POD.
* added $VERSION to PerlMaple/Expression.pm
* Added TODO about making PerlMaple::Expression objects more "lazy" to 
  PerlMaple's POD.
* Removed duplicate code coverage report from PerlMaple::Expression's 
  POD.
* Confirmed that this lib won't work with Maple 7. Sigh.

= Changes for PerlMaple 0.02 (rev 11) - Dec 19, 2005

== Core Enhancements

* On the XS side, ignored MAPLE_TEXT_STATUS output so that
  PerlMaple won't return silly things like
  "bytes used=1963, alloc=719, time=0.44".
* Added AUTOLOAD mechanism so that any Maple functions or procedures
  all automagically become the methods of PerlMaple objects;
* Renamed ->eval method to ->eval_cmd so that ->eval is exactly the
  Maple's counterpart.
* ->eval is not backward-compatible.
* Added optional options PrintError and RaiseError to the constructor
* Added attribute methods PrintError and RaiseError
* Fixed a bug concerning multiple PerlMaple instances creation
* Added corresponding tests.
* Added the PerlMaple::Expression class to represents a Maple expression ASTs.
* PerlMaple::Expression can now build full-featured Perl AST from arbitrary
  Maple expressions. So you can manipulate Maple expressions via data
  structures directly, without the burden of parsing Maple code yourself!
* PerlMaple::Expression provides several useful mehods, such as type, expr,
  and ops.
* Added method to_ast to the PerlMaple class, which is construct a
  PerlMaple::Expression object from the given Maple expression.
* Added ReturnAST attribute to the PerlMaple class (default off).
* PerlMaple's AUTOLOADed methods (shortcuts for Maple functions) and the
  eval_cmd method will return a PerlMaple::Expression object automagically
  if you turn on the ReturnAST attribute.

== Documents

* Added SVN link 'https://svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/win32maple'
  to the POD doc.
* Emphasized that Maple's maplec.h and maplec.lib
  must be in INC and LIB, repectively. Most of the test failure
  reports are concerning this issue.
* Added many, many POD docs and many, many tests for the vast variety of
  new features.
* Added code coverage testing results to POD docs. (Thanks to Devel::Cover.)

= Changes for PerlMaple 0.01 (rev 1) - Nov 15, 2005

* original version; created by h2xs 1.23
* basic functionalities implemented
