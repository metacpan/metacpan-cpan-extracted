AI/NeuralNet/Kohonen version 0.14
=================================

An illustrative implimentation of Kohonen's Self-organising Feature Maps
(SOMs) in Perl.

It's not fast - it's illustrative.

In fact, it's slow: but it's illustrative....

It could be improved to use Perl Data Language (PDL), XS or C, 
but then it's be reworking code that already exists open-source.
