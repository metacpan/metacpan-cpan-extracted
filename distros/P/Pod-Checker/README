Pod::Checker
------------

A module to check the syntax of a POD document. It is just in the
very beginning stages right now and is *far* from being thorough or
complete. Its just a starting point that I hope others who plan to
use it can help me flesh it out further.
This module also collects information about hyperlink nodes of the
document processed that can be used by converters later on.

This separate distribution was created to allow refactoring of Pod::Checker
to use Pod::Simple instead of Pod::Parser, such that Pod::Parser can be
discontinued from the Perl Core in the near future.
