   [ENHANCEMANT & API BREAKAGE]

      * pipes may now be nested. Not all nested pipes may be

        templates to handle nested pipes.  This breaks its API

0.07      2018-11-15 10:03:28-05:00 America/New_York (TRIAL RELEASE)


  [BUILD FIX]

     * previous release had an incomplete Makefile.PL, causing
       failures on Windows

     * note to self: don't release under Dist::Zilla::Shell.
       Dist::Zilla::Plugin::DynamicPrereqs isn't designed to be run in
       that environment.  It munges Makefile.PL and caches what it has
       done to avoid duplication. Unfortunately, this means that
       Makefile.PL will not be properly munged after the first build.


0.06      2018-11-09 16:24:42-05:00 America/New_York (TRIAL RELEASE)

  [BUILD FIX]

     * tests now moved as much as possible to Test2::V0

0.03_02 2014-07-21T17:29:59-0400

  [BUILD FIX]

     * remove extraneous dependency on Exporter::Tiny. Jumped the gun
       on
       http://www.cpantesters.org/cpan/report/0c9e658d-6c00-1014-9524-043f55012b15,
       which reported a problem, but it's with Type::Tiny; this module
       doesn't doesn't explicitly use it.  Might be a tester problem.
