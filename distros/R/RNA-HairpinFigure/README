RNA-HairpinFigure

RNA::HairpinFigure - Draw hairpin-like text figure from RNA 
sequence and its secondary structure in dot-bracket notation.

miRNA database miRBase maintains miRNAs and their precursors --
pre-miRNAs which have hairpin-like secondary structures. They
provide the hairpin-like text figure along with sequences and 
secondary structures in dot-bracket notation which could produced
by ViennaRNA package.

However, neither miRBase nor ViennaRNA provide any scripts or
programs to transfrom dot-bracket notation to hairpin-like text
figure, which was needed in our miRNA prediction project.

RNA::HairpinFigure draws hairpin-like text figure from RNA 
sequence and its secondary structure in dot-bracket notation.
If the hairpin have multi loops, they will be deleted and 
treated as a big loop, the longest stem will be the final stem.

This module is part of the FOMmiR miRNA predictor on
http://bioinf.shenwei.me or http://bioinf.xnyy.cn/.

May this module be helpful for you.
