Revision history for Keyring-Gnome

0.3003	2015-01-06
	Adding kwalitee tests

0.3002	2013-07-04
	A few improvements in documentation and tests: 
        - fixed bitbucket #1 - wrong example of set_password,
        - renamed example and ensured it is distributed,
        - named some tests better

0.3001	2012-11-20
        Fixed some dependencies to make automated tests pass or fail properly
        (should resolve a couple of cpantesters reports).

0.30	2012-11-14
        Reworked internal implementation. Instead of artificially saving
        passwords as network passwords, module now uses it's own password
        schema. Final result:

	- passwords are visible in seahorse with label constructed as
	    "group/realm/username (by app)"

	- in password details (double click password and go to details tab) 
          there are fields named group, realm and user, appropriately 
          matching library API

        Warnings: passwords saved with older version won't be found.

0.2504	2012-11-11
	Added example.

0.2503	2012-11-11
        Module can be installed without active Gnome session
        (most tests are skipped in such case).

        Fixed error in error reporting (lacking import of croak).

0.2502	2012-11-09
	Documentation improvements

0.2501  2012-11-08
        Small documentation fixes, more info in CPAN metadata

0.25    2012-11-08
        Implementing updated app and group semantics (only group is part of password key,
        app is not used at all for a moment).

0.24    2012-11-07
        Handling application name and other API extensions documented
        in Keyring::Auto. App and group are visible in seahorse
        (as User@App/Group)
        clear_password actually removes password instead of setting
        it to "" - and returns info whether it cleared or not.

0.23    2012-11-05
        Fixed problems with install from CPAN ("Can't find __END__...")
        caused by unnecessary autoloader import.

0.22    2012-11-05
        Added is_persistent method.

0.21    2012-11-04
        First version, released on an unsuspecting world.
