Revision history for Perl extension Linux::DVB::DVBT.

2.20 Wed Jul 27 11:24:00 2016
	- Test fix: Modified tests to manually check results (since the HAS randomisation causes Test::More is_deeply() to fail!)

2.19 Mon Mar 18 14:20:00 2013
	- Added proper support for decoding the AC3 and E-AC3 audio pids during scan, where the descriptors are within a private data section
	- Added timeout option to scan (to allow for changing the default tuning timeout during scanning)

2.18 Fri Nov 18 11:32:00 2012
	- Bug fix: fixed bug introduced to record() as part of fixing multiplex usage

2.17 Sun Nov 18 19:49:00 2012
	- Updated dvbt-strength to report error if adapter is not found
	- Added support for multi-language subtitles (thanks to rainbowcrypt)
	- Bug fix: corrected operation of record() so that it starts with a clean 
	  multiplex record (previously it was re-using an existing set and overwriting
	  previously recorded files) 
	- Bug fix: corrected buffer over run caused by device names overflowing structure 

2.16 Fri Oct 28 17:01:00 2011
	- Fixed problem in EPG reporting where the program duration was being incorrectly calculated due to change from British Summer Time to GMT

2.15 Sun Oct 16 17:13:00 2011
	- Fixed bug in mpeg_parse_psi_string() - comparison of first byte was being incorrectly sign extended and the byte
	  treated as a signed int (rather than unsigned). This caused the string to be incorrectly decoded and iconv_string()
	  to segfault
	- Fixed small epg memory leak
	
2.14 Wed Oct 12 12:57:00 2011
	- Handle extra cases for component descriptor (0x50) to gather HD-TV information
	- Strip out invalid frequencies from scan results (e.g. when scan doesn't return information on a seen frequency)
	- Strip out invalid chars from epg (e.g. encrypted HD). Ensures downstream programs (JSON) are not corrupted.

2.13 Thu Sep 29 15:57:00 2011
	- Typo!

2.12 Thu Sep 29 15:44:00 2011
	- Added support for DVB-T2 channels (both in scanning and recording). All supplied scripts should now
	  correctly handle HD channels (which are shown as 'hd-tv' type).

2.11 Wed Sep 14 11:34:00 2011
	- Added ability to scan based on country code rather than frequency file (similar to w_scan)
	- Added a '-countries' option to dvbt-scan to show a list of valid country codes.
	- Now saves the tuning settings embedded in the configuration file so re-scans can be run
	  with no arguments
	- Updated device list gathering to report only DVB-T devices (with the option to report all
	  discovered devices).
	- Added extra type and frequency information to device list
	- Now handles SYMLINK devices so that user can nail the device to a fixed adapter number (using udev)
	- Added 'adapter' field that accepts a string in the format <adapter_num>:<frontend_num> (e.g. 100:1)
	  to simplify specifying the device adapter/frontend numbers in command line scripts.

2.10 Wed Aug 10 16:26:00 2011
	- Added timeslip recording (track start/end/both of program when recording)
	- Improved handling for multiple recordings from the same multiplex
	- Added more information into multiplex info HASH
	- Added better parsing of program EPG text
	- Now uses underlying transport stream parsing provided by Linux::DVB::DVBT::TS

2.09 Wed Apr 13 11:26:00 2011
	- Bug fix of dvbt-tsid-qual
	- Now using new Makeutils.pm helper package to create Makefile
	- Bolted in dvb_ts_lib to provide transport stream decoding for future features

2.08 Tue Mar 25 12:46:00 2011
	- re-write of scan routine to better handle the case where multiple frequencies (TSIDs) contain
	  the same channels. Also handles channel renaming properly now. 
	- Fixed bug with multiplex recording where frontend is not retuned if the same script records from
	  a new TSID
	- Added better channel checking in dvbt-chans script (for the --extra-check option)
	- Added -list and -del options to dvbt-chans script
	- Added new script 'dvbt-tsid-qual' to show multiplex channel quality (or error levels)
	

2.07 Mon Mar 1 10:06:00 2011
	- Re-organised to co-exist with Linux::DVB::DVBT::TS and Linux::DVB::DVBT::Advert
	- Modified so that buffer overflows (i.e. code not keeping up with video stream) is
	  silently ignored. Keeps track of all overflows in recording stats.
	- Added option to display ffmpeg output in dvbt-multirec script

2.06 Tue Jan 18 08:17:00 2011
	- Fixed type rename to pidtype where used by example scripts
	- Fixed issue where incorrect transponder bandwidth is broadcast in the network information. Now
	  uses, in order of preference: the readback information from the tuner, frequency file information,
	  "automatic" settings (where possible), the broadcast NI 

2.05 Wed Apr 21 12:00:00 2010
	- Corrected typo in dvbt-strength script
	- Fixed trsncode command escaping
	- Modified so that it's easier to add extra SI pids into the recording
	- Corrected bug when adding SI tables

2.04 Fri Apr 16 09:00:00 2010
	- Fixed error in dvbt-chans : file length with -extra-check was too large
	- Re-write of low-level epg functions to speed up the process (and stop lock ups)
	- Fixed errors in epg : loop checks were wrong (also increased buffer size)
	- Now sort the config files by tsid & pnr
	- Fixed error message when recording fails (attempted byte was reporting the pointer not the value)
	- Fixed bug in regexp of Utils::fix_episodes that required a word before the episode number
	- Split XS file into more manageable chunks
	- Fixed setting inversion parameter : use AUTO value where possible (rather than 0) 
	  (Reported as [rt.cpan.org #56362] Does not work with DiBcom 3000P/M-C DVB-T)
	- Corrected tuning timeout
	- Modified Ffmpeg module to allow other transcode commands to be added to the command list
		
2.03 Mon Apr 06 16:10:00 2010
	- Fixed error when recording to .ts file (transcoding should just check length)
	
2.02 Mon Apr 06 08:48:00 2010
	- Default to now add SI tables otherwise ffmpeg does not recognise the video stream encoding
	- Various bug fixes to multiplex recording
	- Minor pod tweaks
	
2.01 Mon Mar 22 12:20:00 2010
	- Added proper support for subtitles (now automatically records the PAT & PMT when required)
	- Fixes to module version numbers!
	- Minor pod tweaks
	
2.00 Fri Mar 19 12:20:00 2010
	- Major re-write to add multiplex recording capability
	- Added TVAnytime reqporting in epg 
	- Added subtitle stream pid to config files
	- Fixed bug in scan where frequency reported is less than the minimum required for DVB-T.

1.09 Thu Dec 17 09:23:00 2009
	- Fixed scan for the case where the centre frequency information is not correctly(?) transmitted by the broadcaster (i.e. Italy).
	  Module now (attempts to!) works out the frequency based on the program information gathered.


1.08 Thu Nov 19 12:00:00 2009
	- Added large file support (>2G) for recording. This is a compile time option that is enabled if your Perl build supports it.
	  If this is not supported on your system, then use dvbt-ffrec to get ffmpeg to handle the large recordings
	  (NOTE: This applies to recordings of approx 2hours or more)

1.07 Mon Nov 16 12:00:00 2009
	- Bug fix to scan. New code accounts for tuner cards that readback with the wrong frequency.

1.06 Tue Nov 03 08:00:00 2009
	- Major re-write of scanning logic to make it more robust (also checks signal strengths to choose best
	  transmitter when more than one is available for the same multiplex).
	- Added copious debug facilities to scan logic (including Hi-res timer!). If you have any problems with scanning
	  please re-run with '-verbose 15 -debug 15', direct stderr into a file, and send me the file.
	- Corrected some assumptions about the tuner hardware and frequency files (thanks to Arthur Gidlow for his help with this one)

1.05 Mon Oct 12 11:09:00 2009
	- Fixed typo in epg() method that caused program ids to be created using tsid-pnr rather than lcn
	- Corrected dvbt-ffrec to enclose output filename in quote
	- Numerous fixes to scan and epg related to multiple frequency handling (thanks to Thomas Rehn for his help in debugging)

1.04 Fri Oct 02 10:00:00 2009
	- I've finally worked out how to gather the logical channel number information for all of the channels.
	- Added 'merge' option flag to allow scan results to be merged with previous (default is to overwrite previous)
	- Now removes any channels that are not tv or radio; do not have a channel name; do not have the correct audio/video stream ids
	- Added dvbt-chans utility script
	
1.03  Wed Sept 30 12:30:00 2009
	- Corrected XS so that EPG strings are correctly terminated
	- Fixed genre string copying

1.02  Mon Sept 21 09:30:00 2009
	- Handle the case where a channel scans to have no name (use it's PR number instead)

1.01  Sat Jul 04 12:30:00 2009
	- Bug fix: corrected dvbt-devices script

1.00  Thu Jul 03 12:30:00 2009
	- Added default channel names for EPG
	- Fixed bug in epg() creating channel list
	- Added web check for later version

0.03  Fri Jan 23 12:30:00 2009
	- bug fix in channel name "fuzzy" find
	- improved/corrected documentation
	- updated makefile to install scripts
	- changed dvbt-scan to generate output during scan

0.02  Wed Dec 10 12:46:56 2008
	- Small modifications to build files to allow compile on x64 and FreeBSD

0.01  Wed Oct 15 19:46:56 2008
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.23 with options
		-O -n Linux::DVB::DVBT -A Linux-DVB-DVBT/dvb_lib/dvb_lib.h
