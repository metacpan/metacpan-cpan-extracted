Hello dear reader,

You have stumbled across yet another set of Perl modules to inspect (mostly) and
sometimes manipulate Veritas NetBackup environments.  This set however is
different than any the author saw at the time in that it is truly an object-
oriented approach to the problem of asking questions of a NetBackup setup.  Thus
you will find Perl modules corresponding to each of the major concepts in
NetBackup:
	NBU::Job.pm

	NBU::Pool
	NBU::Media
	NBU::Image
	NBU::Fragment

	NBU::Class (aka Policy)
	NBU::Schedule

	NBU::StorageUnit
	NBU::Robot
	NBU::Drive

	NBU::License

	NBU::Host

and a over-arching class simply called NBU to help hide local environmental
matters as much as possible, allowing you to write your scripts in as neutral
a way as possible.

All these modules are automatically made available to your script when you 'use
NBU' the top level module.  Please take a look at the examples directory to get
a flavor for what these abstractions can do for you.  The bin directory
contains some scripts that are usually helpful right out of the box.
