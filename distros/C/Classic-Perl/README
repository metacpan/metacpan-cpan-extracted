Classic::Perl, version 0.07

This reinstates features deleted in recent versions of perl.

The features we currently provide are:

• split to @_ in void and scalar context. This feature was removed in
  perl 5.11. With this module, you can have it back.

• $* - This was removed in perl 5.9.

• $[ - This was removed in perl 5.15.3 and reinstated in 5.15.5. This
  may be removed from  Classic::Perl  (and then reinstated if  it  is
  again removed from Perl).
