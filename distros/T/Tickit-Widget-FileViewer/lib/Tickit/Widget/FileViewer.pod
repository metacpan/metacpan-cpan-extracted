=head2 line_attributes

Given a zero-based line number and line text, returns the attributes
to apply for this line.

This method is intended for line-level highlights such as current cursor
position or selected text - For syntax highlighting, overriding the
L</render_line_data> method may be more appropriate.

=head2 render_to_rb

Render this widget. Will call L</render_line_data> and L</render_line_number>
to do the actual drawing.

=head2 render_line_number

Renders the given (zero-based) line number at the current
cursor position.

Subclasses should override this to provide styling as required.

=head2 render_line_data

Renders the given line text at the current cursor position.

Subclasses should override this to provide styling as required.

=head2 on_key

Handle a keypress event. Passes the event on to L</handle_key> or
L</handle_text> as appropriate.

=head2 cursor_line

Accessor for the current cursor line. Will trigger a redraw if
we have a window and the cursor line has changed.

=head2 handle_key

Handle a keypress event. Currently hard-coded to accept
up, down, pageup and pagedown events.

=head2 handle_text

Stub method for dealing with text events.

=head2 top_line

=head1 SEE ALSO

=over 4

=item * L<Tickit::Widget::Scroller> - support for scrollable list of widgets, generally much cleaner and
flexible than this implementation, and could easily provide similar functionality if the line number and
code for each line are wrapped in another widget
