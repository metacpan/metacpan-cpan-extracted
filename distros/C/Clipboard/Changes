0.09    2005-10-20

    - Included Anton Berezin's Clipboard::Xclip fix for data that includes \n\n
    - Added scripts/clipfilter (also with Anton's feedback)
    - Removed dependency on IO::All
    - Cheated to make CPAN tests pass (turned 'xclip' dependency into warning).

    hard to read and pare down to a minimal set.
