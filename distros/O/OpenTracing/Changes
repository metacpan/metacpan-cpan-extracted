Revision history for OpenTracing

1.003     2020-08-26 09:04:56+08:00 Asia/Kuala_Lumpur
    New features:

    - provides a hook for notifying implementations when there are new spans,
    rather than having to poll

    Bugs fixed:

    - disabled by default - no point collecting spans if nothing's going to submit them

1.002     2020-07-13 01:54:48+08:00 Asia/Kuala_Lumpur
    No new features.

    Bugs fixed:

    - warning when current span was not defined

1.001     2020-06-29 00:54:31+08:00 Asia/Kuala_Lumpur
    New features:

    - expose ->current_span, to support Log::Any::Adapter::OpenTracing
    - this is cleared when the span finishes, so that we only accumulate logs within a span

1.000     2020-06-29 00:07:54+08:00 Asia/Kuala_Lumpur
    New features:

    - ID generation is now full 128-bit, using Bytes::Random::Secure
    - async support is now possible (using Syntax::Keyword::Dynamically)
    - OpenTracing::Integration support (most of these involve external
    deps, so will end up as separate distributions)
    - mention OpenTracing::Role in an attempt to reduce confusion

0.004     2020-04-23 02:35:27+08:00 Asia/Kuala_Lumpur
    New features:

    - includes OpenTracing::Any base implementation, inspired by Log::Any
    - simple DSL in OpenTracing::DSL
    - since this requires postderef, minimum perl version is now explicitly set to 5.20+

0.003     2019-06-16 21:56:03+08:00 Asia/Kuala_Lumpur
    No new features.

    Bugs fixed:

    - extended the random IDs to 63-bit (was 62-bit, the protocol defines as 128-bit but the overhead of
    generating these is a bit too high for comfort)

    Documentation:

    - added basic class information

0.002     2019-06-10 06:03:51+08:00 Asia/Kuala_Lumpur

    Bugs fixed:
