NAME
    Kwiki::Archive::Cvs - Kwiki Page Archival Using CVS

SYNOPSIS
    A Kwiki::Archive that stores changes in a CVS repository.

DESCRIPTION
    This is a direct modification of Brian Ingerson's Kwiki::Archive::Rcs
    module to work with CVS instead of RCS. It was written and tested
    against the 0.39 release of Kwiki.

    *   The underlying CVS command must support the -Q option (specifies
        'really quiet' operation).

    *   Install the module, then add 'Kwiki::Archive::Cvs' to the plugins
        file and run 'kwiki -update'.

    *   Make sure the 'database' directory holds a checked-out CVS sandbox.
