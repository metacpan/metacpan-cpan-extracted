NAME
    POE::Declare - A POE abstraction layer for conciseness and simplicity

SYNOPSIS
      package MyComponent;
      
  use strict;
      use POE::Declare {
          foo      => 'Attribute',
          bar      => 'Internal',
          Username => 'Param',
          Password => 'Param',
      };
      
  declare TimeoutError => 'Message';
      
  sub hello : Event {
          print "Hello World!\n";
          $_[SELF]->hello_timeout_start;
      }
      
  sub hello_timeout : Timeout(30) {
          print "Alas, I die!\n";
      
      # Tell our parent as well
          $_[SELF]->TimeoutError;
      }
      
  compile;

DESCRIPTION
    POE is a very powerful and flexible system for doing asynchronous
    programming. But it has the reputation of being difficult to learn, with
    a somewhat confusing set of abstractions.

    In particular, it can be tricky to resolve POE's way of programming with
    the highly abstracted OO structures that many people are used to, with
    layer stacked upon layer ad-infinitum to produce a delegation heirachy
    which allows for powerful and complex systems that are relatively easy
    to maintain.

    This can be particularly noticable as the scale of a POE codebase gets
    larger. At three levels of abstraction the layering in POE becomes quite
    difficult, and progess past about the third layer of abstraction becomes
    extremely difficult.

    POE::Declare is an attempt to resolve this problem by locking down part
    of the traditional flexibility of POE, and by making it easier to split
    the implementation of each object between an object-oriented heirachy
    and a collection of POE sessions.

    The goal is to retain the ability to build deep and complex heirachies
    of encapsulated functionality in your application while also allowing
    you to take advantage of the asynchronous nature of POE code.

  General Architecture
    At the core of any POE::Declare application is an object-oriented
    heirachy of components. This heirachy exists whether or not the POE
    kernel is running, and parts of it can be started and stopped as needed.

    When it is spawned, each component will create it's own private
    POE::Session in which to run its events and store its resources.

    Each instance of a class always has one and only one session. This may
    be a problem if your application will have thousands of spawned
    components at once (POE recommends against the use of large numbers of
    sessions) but should not be a problem as long as you keep it down to a
    few hundred components.

    Because the POE session is slaved to the POE::Declare::Object, the
    component can handle being started and stopped many times without the
    loss of any state data between the creation and destruction of each
    slave session.

    To allow support for components that have no resources and only act as
    supervisors, POE::Declare always assigns a POE alias for the session
    while it is active. The existance of this Alias prevents POE cleaning up
    the session accidentally, and ensures components have explicit control
    over when they want to shut down their sessions.

    Each POE component contains a set of named resources. Resources may
    consist of a different underlying POE resource, or may be made up of
    multiple resources, and additional data stored in the matching object
    HASH key. To ensure all the various underlying resources will not clash
    with each other, all resources must be declared and will be strictly
    checked.

    At the end of each class, instead of the usual 1; to allow the package
    to return true, you put instead a "compile;" statement.

    This instructs POE::Declare to inventory the declarations and
    attributes, combine them with declarations from the parent classes, and
    then generate the code that will implement the structures.

    Once the class has been compiled, the installed functions will be
    removed from the package to prevent run-time namespace pollution.

  Import-Time Declaration
    The cluster of "declare" statements at the beginning of a POE::Declare
    class can look ugly to some people, and may get annoying to step through
    in the debugger.

    To resolve this, you may optionally provide a list of slot declarations
    to the module at compile time. This should be in the form of a simple
    "HASH" reference with the names as keys and the type as values.

      use My::Module {
          Foo => 'Param',
          Bar => 'Param',
      };

    Event and timeout declarations cannot be provided by this method, and
    you should continue to use subroutine attributes for these as normal.

  Inheritance
    The resource model of POE::Declare correctly follows inheritance,
    similar to the way declarations in Moose are inherited. Resource types
    in a parent class cannot be overwritten or modified in child classes.

    No special syntax is needed for inheritance, as POE::Declare works
    directly on top of Perl's native inheritance.

      # Parent.pm - Object that connects to a service
      package My::Parent;
      
  use strict;
      use POE::Declare {
          Host           => 'Param',
          Port           => 'Param',
          ConnectSuccess => 'Message',
          ConnectFailure => 'Message',
      };
      
  sub connect : Event {
          # ...
      }
      
  compile;
      
  # Child.pm - Connect to an (optionally) authenticating service
      package My::Child;
      
  use strict;
      use base 'My::Parent';
      use POE::Declare {
          Username     => 'Param',
          Password     => 'Param',
          AuthRequired => 'Message',
          AuthInvalid  => 'Message',
      };
      
  compile;

CLASSES
    POE::Declare is composed of three main modules, and a tree of
    slot/attribute classes.

  POE::Declare
    POE::Declare provides the main interface layer and Domain Specific API
    for declaratively building your POE::Declare classes.

  POE::Declare::Object
    POE::Declare::Object is the abstract base class for all classes created
    by POE::Declare.

  POE::Declare::Meta
    POE::Declare::Meta implements the metadata structures that describe each
    of your POE::Declare classes. This is superficially similar to something
    like Moose, but unlike Moose is fast, light weight and can use
    domain-specific assumptions.

  POE::Declare::Slot
      POE::Declare::Meta::Slot
        POE::Declare::Meta::Internal
        POE::Declare::Meta::Attribute
          POE::Declare::Meta::Param
        POE::Declare::Meta::Message
        POE::Declare::Meta::Event
          POE::Declare::Meta::Timeout

  POE::Declare::Meta::Internal
    POE::Declare::Meta::Internal is a slot class that won't generate any
    functionality, but allows you to reserve an attribute for internal use
    so that they won't be used by any sub-classes.

  POE::Declare::Meta::Attribute
    POE::Declare::Meta::Attribute is a slot class used for readable
    attributes.

  POE::Declare::Meta::Param
    POE::Declare::Meta::Attribute is a slot class for attributes that are
    provided to the constructor as a parameter.

  POE::Declare::Meta::Message
    POE::Declare::Meta::Message is a slot class for declaring messages that
    the object will emit under various circumstances. Each message is a
    param to the constructor that takes a callback in a variety of formats
    (usually pointing up to the parent object).

  POE::Declare::Meta::Event
    POE::Declare::Meta::Event is a class for named POE events that can be
    called or yielded to by other POE messages/events.

  POE::Declare::Meta::Timeout
    POE::Declare::Meta::Timeout is a POE::Declare::Meta::Event sub-class
    that is designed to trigger from an alarm and generates additional
    methods to manage the alarms.

FUNCTIONS
    For the first few releases, I plan to leave this module undocumented.

    That I am releasing this distribution at all is more of a way to mark my
    progress, and to allow other POE/OO people to look at the implementation
    and comment.

  declare
      declare one   => 'Internal';
      declare two   => 'Attribute';
      declare three => 'Param';
      declare four  => 'Message';

    The "declare" function is exported by default. It takes two parameters,
    a slot name and a slot type.

    The slot name can be any legal Perl identifier.

    The slot type should be one of "Internal", "Attribute", "Param" or
    "Message".

    Creates the new slot, throws an exception on error.

  compile
    The "compile" function indicates that all attributes and events have
    been defined and the structure should be finalised and compiled.

    Returns true or throws an exception.
