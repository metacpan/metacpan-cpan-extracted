Benchmark::Stopwatch::Pause - simple timing of stages of your code with a pause option.

Version 0.03

DESCRIPTION

   This is an extention of the handy Benchmark::Stopwatch module. This is an
attempt to allow very granular timeing of very specific sections of code. The 
Stopwatch concept is carried thru in this module, while adding the ability to
pause your stopwatch as needed.

CHANGES 

Things that differ from Benchmark::Stopwatch

* Laps are now look ahead

   The concept of a lap is diffrent from Benchmark::Stopwatch, they are now look ahead.

   In Benchmark::Stopwatch :

      # ... code that is tracked by lap 'one'
      $stopwatch->lap('one');

   In Benchmark::Stopwatch::Pause :

      $stopwatch->lap('one');
      # ... code that is tracked by lap 'one'

   This allows the time from unpause till pause to be tied to your unpause. 

* _start_ is displayed in the summary

   Due to the change in the logic of what a lap is _start_ will be displayed.

* _stop_ is not displayed in summary

   Due to the change in the logic of what a lap is _stop_ will always be a null event.
