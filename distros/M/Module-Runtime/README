DESCRIPTION
    The functions exported by this module deal with runtime handling of Perl
    modules, which are normally handled at compile time. This module avoids
    using any other modules, so that it can be used in low-level
    infrastructure.

    The parts of this module that work with module names apply the same
    syntax that is used for barewords in Perl source. In principle this
    syntax can vary between versions of Perl, and this module applies the
    syntax of the Perl on which it is running. In practice the usable syntax
    hasn't changed yet. There's some intent for Unicode module names to be
    supported in the future, but this hasn't yet amounted to any consistent
    facility.

    The functions of this module whose purpose is to load modules include
    workarounds for three old Perl core bugs regarding "require". These
    workarounds are applied on any Perl version where the bugs exist, except
    for a case where one of the bugs cannot be adequately worked around in
    pure Perl.

  Module name syntax
    The usable module name syntax has not changed from Perl 5.000 up to Perl
    5.19.8. The syntax is composed entirely of ASCII characters. From Perl
    5.6 onward there has been some attempt to allow the use of non-ASCII
    Unicode characters in Perl source, but it was fundamentally broken (like
    the entirety of Perl 5.6's Unicode handling) and remained pretty much
    entirely unusable until it got some attention in the Perl 5.15 series.
    Although Unicode is now consistently accepted by the parser in some
    places, it remains broken for module names. Furthermore, there has not
    yet been any work on how to map Unicode module names into filenames, so
    in that respect also Unicode module names are unusable.

    The module name syntax is, precisely: the string must consist of one or
    more segments separated by "::"; each segment must consist of one or
    more identifier characters (ASCII alphanumerics plus "_"); the first
    character of the string must not be a digit. Thus ""IO::File"",
    ""warnings"", and ""foo::123::x_0"" are all valid module names, whereas
    ""IO::"" and ""1foo::bar"" are not. "'" separators are not permitted by
    this module, though they remain usable in Perl source, being translated
    to "::" in the parser.

  Core bugs worked around
    The first bug worked around is core bug [perl #68590], which causes
    lexical state in one file to leak into another that is "require"d/"use"d
    from it. This bug is present from Perl 5.6 up to Perl 5.10, and is fixed
    in Perl 5.11.0. From Perl 5.9.4 up to Perl 5.10.0 no satisfactory
    workaround is possible in pure Perl. The workaround means that modules
    loaded via this module don't suffer this pollution of their lexical
    state. Modules loaded in other ways, or via this module on the Perl
    versions where the pure Perl workaround is impossible, remain
    vulnerable. The module Lexical::SealRequireHints provides a complete
    workaround for this bug.

    The second bug worked around causes some kinds of failure in module
    loading, principally compilation errors in the loaded module, to be
    recorded in %INC as if they were successful, so later attempts to load
    the same module immediately indicate success. This bug is present up to
    Perl 5.8.9, and is fixed in Perl 5.9.0. The workaround means that a
    compilation error in a module loaded via this module won't be cached as
    a success. Modules loaded in other ways remain liable to produce bogus
    %INC entries, and if a bogus entry exists then it will mislead this
    module if it is used to re-attempt loading.

    The third bug worked around causes the wrong context to be seen at file
    scope of a loaded module, if "require" is invoked in a location that
    inherits context from a higher scope. This bug is present up to Perl
    5.11.2, and is fixed in Perl 5.11.3. The workaround means that a module
    loaded via this module will always see the correct context. Modules
    loaded in other ways remain vulnerable.

REGULAR EXPRESSIONS
    These regular expressions do not include any anchors, so to check
    whether an entire string matches a syntax item you must supply the
    anchors yourself.

    $module_name_rx
        Matches a valid Perl module name in bareword syntax.

    $top_module_spec_rx
        Matches a module specification for use with "compose_module_name".
        where no prefix is being used.

    $sub_module_spec_rx
        Matches a module specification for use with "compose_module_name",
        where a prefix is being used.

FUNCTIONS
  Basic module handling
    is_module_name(ARG)
        Returns a truth value indicating whether *ARG* is a plain string
        satisfying Perl module name syntax as described for
        "$module_name_rx".

    is_valid_module_name(ARG)
        Deprecated alias for "is_module_name".

    check_module_name(ARG)
        Check whether *ARG* is a plain string satisfying Perl module name
        syntax as described for "$module_name_rx". Return normally if it is,
        or "die" if it is not.

    module_notional_filename(NAME)
        Generates a notional relative filename for a module, which is used
        in some Perl core interfaces. The *NAME* is a string, which should
        be a valid module name (one or more "::"-separated segments). If it
        is not a valid name, the function "die"s.

        The notional filename for the named module is generated and
        returned. This filename is always in Unix style, with "/" directory
        separators and a ".pm" suffix. This kind of filename can be used as
        an argument to "require", and is the key that appears in %INC to
        identify a module, regardless of actual local filename syntax.

    require_module(NAME)
        This is essentially the bareword form of "require", in runtime form.
        The *NAME* is a string, which should be a valid module name (one or
        more "::"-separated segments). If it is not a valid name, the
        function "die"s.

        The module specified by *NAME* is loaded, if it hasn't been already,
        in the manner of the bareword form of "require". That means that a
        search through @INC is performed, and a byte-compiled form of the
        module will be used if available.

        The return value is as for "require". That is, it is the value
        returned by the module itself if the module is loaded anew, or 1 if
        the module was already loaded.

  Structured module use
    use_module(NAME[, VERSION])
        This is essentially "use" in runtime form, but without the importing
        feature (which is fundamentally a compile-time thing). The *NAME* is
        handled just like in "require_module" above: it must be a module
        name, and the named module is loaded as if by the bareword form of
        "require".

        If a *VERSION* is specified, the "VERSION" method of the loaded
        module is called with the specified *VERSION* as an argument. This
        normally serves to ensure that the version loaded is at least the
        version required. This is the same functionality provided by the
        *VERSION* parameter of "use".

        On success, the name of the module is returned. This is unlike
        "require_module", and is done so that the entire call to
        "use_module" can be used as a class name to call a constructor, as
        in the example in the synopsis.

    use_package_optimistically(NAME[, VERSION])
        This is an analogue of "use_module" for the situation where there is
        uncertainty as to whether a package/class is defined in its own
        module or by some other means. It attempts to arrange for the named
        package to be available, either by loading a module or by doing
        nothing and hoping.

        An attempt is made to load the named module (as if by the bareword
        form of "require"). If the module cannot be found then it is assumed
        that the package was actually already loaded by other means, and no
        error is signaled. That's the optimistic bit.

        *Warning:* this optional module loading is liable to cause
        unreliable behaviour, including security problems. It interacts
        especially badly with having "." in @INC, which was the default
        state of affairs in Perls prior to 5.25.11. If a package is actually
        defined by some means other than a module, then applying this
        function to it causes a spurious attempt to load a module that is
        expected to be non-existent. If a module actually exists under that
        name then it will be unintentionally loaded. If "." is in @INC and
        this code is ever run with the current directory being one writable
        by a malicious user (such as /tmp), then the malicious user can
        easily cause the victim to run arbitrary code, by creating a module
        file under the predictable spuriously-loaded name in the writable
        directory. Generally, optional module loading should be avoided.

        This is mostly the same operation that is performed by the base
        pragma to ensure that the specified base classes are available. The
        behaviour of base was simplified in version 2.18, and later improved
        in version 2.20, and on both occasions this function changed to
        match.

        If a *VERSION* is specified, the "VERSION" method of the loaded
        package is called with the specified *VERSION* as an argument. This
        normally serves to ensure that the version loaded is at least the
        version required. On success, the name of the package is returned.
        These aspects of the function work just like "use_module".

  Module name composition
    is_module_spec(PREFIX, SPEC)
        Returns a truth value indicating whether *SPEC* is valid input for
        "compose_module_name". See below for what that entails. Whether a
        *PREFIX* is supplied affects the validity of *SPEC*, but the exact
        value of the prefix is unimportant, so this function treats *PREFIX*
        as a truth value.

    is_valid_module_spec(PREFIX, SPEC)
        Deprecated alias for "is_module_spec".

    check_module_spec(PREFIX, SPEC)
        Check whether *SPEC* is valid input for "compose_module_name".
        Return normally if it is, or "die" if it is not.

    compose_module_name(PREFIX, SPEC)
        This function is intended to make it more convenient for a user to
        specify a Perl module name at runtime. Users have greater need for
        abbreviations and context-sensitivity than programmers, and Perl
        module names get a little unwieldy. *SPEC* is what the user
        specifies, and this function translates it into a module name in
        standard form, which it returns.

        *SPEC* has syntax approximately that of a standard module name: it
        should consist of one or more name segments, each of which consists
        of one or more identifier characters. However, "/" is permitted as a
        separator, in addition to the standard "::". The two separators are
        entirely interchangeable.

        Additionally, if *PREFIX* is not "undef" then it must be a module
        name in standard form, and it is prefixed to the user-specified
        name. The user can inhibit the prefix addition by starting *SPEC*
        with a separator (either "/" or "::").

BUGS
    On Perl versions 5.7.2 to 5.8.8, if "require" is overridden by the
    "CORE::GLOBAL" mechanism, it is likely to break the heuristics used by
    "use_package_optimistically", making it signal an error for a missing
    module rather than assume that it was already loaded. From Perl 5.8.9
    onward, and on 5.7.1 and earlier, this module can avoid being confused
    by such an override. On the affected versions, a "require" override
    might be installed by Lexical::SealRequireHints, if something requires
    its bugfix but for some reason its XS implementation isn't available.
