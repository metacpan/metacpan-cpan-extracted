Revision history for Perl extension Javascript::MD5.

1.10  Sun Feb 21 12:55:26 2010
	- Remove text 'All rights reserved' (for Debian licensing).
	- Remove POD heads 'Required Modules' and 'Changes'.

1.09  Wed Feb 10 14:02:10 2010
	- MANIFEST.SKIP updated to exclude MYMETA.yml. Add MYMETA.yml.

1.08  Fri Nov 13 13:20:00 2009
	- Run dos2unix
	- Rename Changes.txt to CHANGES

1.07  Thu Oct 23 18:19:00 2008
	- Remove ^M chars from source, including within the Javascript

1.06  Sat Aug 04 13:52:00 2007
	- Extend method javascript() to take a second parameter, which is the
		number of the CGI form within the HTML page. The allows the module to
		operate on an HTML page containing more than one CGI form.
		The default value is 0, which is the first form, and perhaps the only form,
		on the page. So, no need to upgrade if you only have one form per page
	- Update the docs to describe this new parameter
	- Note: Original patch kindly supplied by Thomas Goik
	
1.05  Fri Oct 21 14:27:00 2005
	- No code changes (ouside new() ), so no need to upgrade
	- Simplify code in new() to no longer check if caller is an object
		as per the new standard on such matters. Personally, I don't care :-)
	- Add more things to MANIFEST.SKIP
	- Regenerate META.yml with Module::Build V 0.2611 to correct a faulty
		META.yml output by V 0.24 which falsely said 'provides: {}',
		which in turn stopped the PAUSE indexer from finding the MD5.pm file,
		which in turn meant this module was omitted from the master index:
		ftp://pause.perl.org/pub/PAUSE/modules/01modules.index.html

1.04  Tue Jul 20 20:43:00 2004
	- Change Makefile.PL to coexist with Module::Build
	- Add t/pod.t to test all PODs

1.03  Tue Apr  27 14:59:04 2004
	- Replace Yahoo!'s version of the Javascript with Paul Johnston's version,
		from his web site: http://pajhome.org.uk/crypt/md5
	- Change the name of the function you call in your submit button code,
		from RetMD5() - the Yahoo! name - to str2hex_md5() - a name more in keeping
		with Paul's naming convention
	- Add 2 extra functions, str2b64_md5() and str2str_md5(), to return other versions
		of the digest

1.02  Tue Apr  13 13:13:13 2004
	- There are no code changes in this version
	- Document the optional parameter to the 'javascript' method
	- Add a section to the docs about CGI form submission, including calling the onClick event handler

1.01  Tue Mar  16 14:36:00 2004
	- Correct the docs, which somehow got chopped off in V 1.00
	- There are no code changes, so there is no need to upgrade

1.00  Fri Mar  05 10:23:29 2004
	- Original version
	- The original Javascript code from Yahoo is shipped as yahoo.js.
		See http://4.11.205.206/yahoo.zip.
		Many thanks to Mark S Pryor for telling me about yahoo.js
	- I have deleted from that code some functions which were not called, changed all
		" to ', and made the CGI form field name, by default 'password', a parameter
	- The program in the synopsis is in the examples/ directory
