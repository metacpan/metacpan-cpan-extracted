0.05 2008-06-11, feature release, update not required

- Add object oriented variant implementation [BDKCVR-1],
  introducing Class::Business::DK::CVR

- Added prerequisites test (Test::Prereq) [BDKCVR-2]

- Added requirement of Scalar::Util, we are stealing as much as
  we can from Michael Peters's distribution:

    Data::FormValidator::Constraints::DateTime

- Added a LICENSE file

- Added LICENSE file and split COPYRIGHT and LICENSE section in
  POD into two separate sections

- Restructured tests files to follow namespace in directory
  structure

- Added recursive_test_files to Build.PL

- Added create_readme to Build.PL

- Introduced generate method so valid CVRs now can be generated
  randomly

- Introduced
  Data::FormValidator::Constraints::Business::DK::CVR, this is
  sort of an example application, it is however just a simple
  wrapper fitting into the Data::FormValidator::Constraints
  framework - it is should be usable, not just a demo, but still
  experimental


0.04 2007-03-13, maintenance release, update not required

- Fixed problem in t/critic.t, I had implemented a mix of my own
  and the recommended Perl::Critic test, so it gave unforseen
  test failures


0.03 2007-03-12, maintenance release, update not required

- Added Perl::Critic test, t/critic.t and related t/perlcriticrc

- Updated to more contemporary versions of:
    t/pod-coverage.t
    t/pod.t

  These should be there for the quality, but will not be run as
  a part of the normal test run, unless the TEST_POD environment
  variable is set.

  This seem to be the defacto way of doing things.


0.02 2006-03-01, maintenance release, update not required

- Added some more links to SEE ALSO section, apparently there is
  already a module on CPAN capable of validating CVR numbers
  this module does not use the name CVR so I did no locate it
  prior to releasing this module to CPAN


0.01 2006-02-21

- Initial version
