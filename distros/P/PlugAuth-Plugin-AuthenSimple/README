    PlugAuth

VERSION

    version 0.04

SYNOPSIS

    PlugAuth.conf:

     ---
     plugin:
       - PlugAuth::Plugin::AuthenSimple:
           - Authen::Simple::PAM:
               service: login
           - Authen::Simple::SMB:
               domain: DOMAIN
               pdc: PDC

DESCRIPTION

    NOTE: This module has been deprecated, and may be removed on or after
    31 December 2018. Please see
    https://github.com/clustericious/Clustericious/issues/46.

    This plugin allows any Authen::Simple implementation to be used as an
    authentication mechanism for PlugAuth. Because Authen::Simple does not
    provide a user list, neither does this plugin, so you will need to
    maintain a list of users, perhaps using the
    PlugAuth::Plugin::FlatUserList plugin.
