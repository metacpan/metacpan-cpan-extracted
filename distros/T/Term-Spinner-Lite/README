NAME
    Term::Spinner::Lite - A spinner without so much Moose in it

VERSION
    version 0.03

SYNOPSIS
      use utf8;
      use 5.010;
      use Term::Spinner::Lite;
      my $s = Term::Spinner::Lite->new(
        delay => 100_000,
        spin_chars => ['◑', '◒', '◐', '◓'],
      );

      $s->next() for 1 .. 100_000;
      $s->done();

    This is a simple spinner, useful when you want to show some kind of
    activity during a long-running activity of non-determinant length. It's
    loosely based on the API from Term::Spinner. Unlike Term::Spinner
    though, this module doesn't have any dependencies outside of modules
    shipped with Perl itself.

ATTRIBUTES
  output_handle
    Gets or sets the handle where output will be written. By default, uses
    STDERR. You may pass an optional PerlIO encoding specification. By
    default it will use ":utf8" in case you want to use UTF8 characters in
    your spinner.

  spin_chars
    Gets or sets the list of characters to cycle through. By default it uses
    the sequence "-" "\" "|" "/". This attribute must be set using an array
    ref, e.g.,

      [ qw( . o O o ) ]

    This attribute will croak by an attempt to set itself using anything
    else.

  delay
    Gets or sets the delay between state changes in microseconds. (A good
    value for smooth spinning is 100000.) Defaults to 0.

METHODS
  new()
    The object constructor. You may optionally set object attributes
    "spin_chars" or "output_handle" in the parameter list.

  count()
    Return the number of advances through the spin sequence.

  next()
    Advance the spinner state to the next character in the spin sequence and
    output it to "output_handle".

  done()
    Finish spinning, and clear the last character printed. If a true value
    is passed, output a newline.
