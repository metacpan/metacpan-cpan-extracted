Revision history for Perl extension JavaScript::Lint.

0.07  TBD
    - Worked around an apparent bug in the JavaScript module when compiled with
      libjs >= 1.7.0.
    - Updated to latest version of JSLint (2011-10-23). This switches most 
      options from being restrictive to being permissive (and consequently the
      default bahaviour is restrictive rather than permissive). Also adds a 
      whole bunch of new options and changes the output significantly.

0.06  Sat Apr 28 10:31:06 BST 2007
    - Update to latest version of JSLint (2007-04-26).  This changes some of
      the options as well as a few of the outputs.

0.05  Wed Jun  7 14:32:07 BST 2006
    - Import standard Pod tests.  Fix pod accordingly.
    - Don't blow up when we have no errors and jslint returned false.

0.04  Mon Jun  5 21:25:57 BST 2006
    - Renamed to JavaScript::JSLint to more accurately reflect the underlying
      software in use.
    - Added more tests/docs for the HTML side of things.
    - Stop after invalid options in bin/jslint.

0.03  Sun Jun  4 11:42:08 BST 2006
    - Urgh.  Allow an empty string to be linted correctly.
    - Ensure the correct exit code comes out of the jslint command line tool.

0.02  Sun Jun  4 10:20:13 BST 2006
    - Turn a fatal error into something more readable.  It happens that I
      missed a comment in the JSLint source pointing out that it returned
      nulls...
    - Allow passing in options to jslint().
    - Add in options to the jslint command line tool as well.
