# Optional: A string of your choosing, used to identify your application. The
# userAgent must be ASCII.
# userAgent=INSERT_USER_AGENT_HERE

# A 22 character Developer Token.
developerToken=INSERT_DEVELOPER_TOKEN_HERE

# To use an alternative URL in case you want to manually proxy your requests
# or fake the API servers.

# The Client Customer ID of the client account your application will access.
# This can be programmatically set in the Client object as
# $client->set_client_id

# Optional: Configure reporting to skip the header row containing the report

### Peer verification of SSL certificates ###
#
# To avoid spoofing attacks, enable either a CAPath or CAFile for SSL
# certificates validation.
#
# This library can use two different underlying SSL modules either
# IO::Socket::SSL or Crypt::SSLeay, being IO::Socket::SSL the default and
# recommended since it can do certificate authenticity validation as well as
# hostname validation while Crypt::SSLeay does not support hostname validation.

# The certificate authority directory to search in when performing peer
# validation. For example: /etc/ssl/certs
# CAPath=<PATH TO CERTIFICATE AUTHORITY DIRECTORY>

# The certificate authority file to use when performing peer validation.
# For example: /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt
# CAFile=<PATH TO CERTIFICATE AUTHORITY FILE>

### Authorization Mechanisms ###
#
# The library supports the OAuth2 mechanism. Uncomment the appropriate lines
# below for the OAuth2 flow chosen.
#
# Also to learn more about API authorization please visit
# https://developers.google.com/accounts/docs/GettingStarted

### OAuth2 ###

# Uncomment the following keys to use OAuth 2 authorization.
# All these values are found in the Google API Console.
#
# oAuth2ClientId=INSERT_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID_HERE

# For the Web/Installed Applications flow, uncomment the following.
#
# oAuth2ClientSecret=INSERT_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET_HERE
#
# Then you need one of the following two options.
#
# Option 1: Uncomment the following if you already have OAuth2 authorization
# tokens.
# oAuth2AccessToken=INSERT_OAUTH_TOKEN_HERE
# oAuth2RefreshToken=INSERT_OAUTH_TOKEN_HERE
#
# Option 2: Use the library to trigger the authorization flow and have the
# user authorize access to his account. See the
# examples/oauth/generate_offline_credentials.pl to learn how to use the
# library for requesting user authorization.
#
# Optionally, uncomment the following if you want to change defaults for the
# user interaction flow.
# Default offline
# oAuth2AccessType=[online|offline]
# Default auto
# oAuth2ApprovalPrompt=[force|auto]
# Defaults to urn:ietf:wg:oauth:2.0:oob
# oAuth2RedirectUri=INSERT_REDIRECT_URI_HERE
#
# Optionally, uncomment the oAuth2AdditionalScopes line to provide additional
# OAuth2 scopes. The AdWords API OAuth2 scope is always included. For
# additional OAuth2 scopes, reference the OAuth 2.0 Playground
# (https://developers.google.com/oauthplayground/). In the playground, each
# application has a list of OAuth2 scopes. For example, you would enter
# https://www.googleapis.com/auth/analytics here as a value if you would like
# to include Google Analytics as an additional scope.
# oAuth2AdditionalScopes=INSERT_COMMA_SEPARATED_LIST_OF_SCOPES_HERE
#
# For Service Accounts, you can either provide a PEM file or a JSON file.
#
# Service Account Option 1 - JSON File:
# Uncomment the following to use a JSON file.
# oAuth2ServiceAccountJSONFile=INSERT_PATH_TO_YOUR_CERTIFICATE_FILE_HERE
# oAuth2ServiceAccountDelegateEmailAddress=INSERT_EMAIL_TO_IMPERSONATE_HERE
#
# Service Account Option 2 - PEM File (deprecated):
# In order to user the library for service accounts you need to transform your
# p12 certificate as generated by the Google API Console to PEM format. And make
# sure no password is set.
# In Linux/Unix systems with openssl installed you can execute.
# > openssl pkcs12 -in {private-key}.p12 -out {private-key}.pem -nodes
# Uncomment the following to use a PEM file.
# oAuth2ServiceAccountEmailAddress=INSERT_OAUTH_CLIENT_EMAIL_HERE
# oAuth2ServiceAccountPEMFile=INSERT_PATH_TO_YOUR_CERTIFICATE_FILE_HERE
# oAuth2ServiceAccountDelegateEmailAddress=INSERT_EMAIL_TO_IMPERSONATE_HERE

### SOAP Library ###
# Uncomment the following to use the XML::XPath SOAP library and not the
# XML::LibXML SOAP library.
# soap.legacy=1
