- This distribution has been renamed to Params::ValidationCompiler, so use
  that instead. This release of Params::CheckCompiler now dies when its loaded

- Make the compiled sub for checking named params die if given a single object

  used. Reported by Mark Fowler. GitHub #3.

  name. Requested by Mark Fowler. GitHub #1.
