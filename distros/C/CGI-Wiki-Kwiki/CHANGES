2005/01/29 - (0.58)
             Skip binmode step on older perls - this distro will now work
             on pre-5.8 again.
             Added documentation and --help option to cgi-wiki-kwiki-install.

2005/01/27 - (0.57)
             Small update to fix test failures when old version of
             CGI::Wiki::Formatter::Multiple is installed (Bob Walker).

2004/09/02 - (0.56)
             Added code to the installer script. Changed the Build.PL to
             copy the templates into the perl5 lib path. Added a new
             copy of wiki.cgi into the 'bin' directory. The installer
             script copies the templates and the cgi script into the current
             directory, and creates an empty sqlite database. This should
             leave you with a working CGI::Wiki::Kwiki install.
             
             Added comments to most of the templates to explain their
             function. Added a stylesheet, installed along with the
             templates.
             
             Fixed bug where the prefs page died if the site had a ' in
             the name. This will invalidate most existing preferences
             cookies.
             
             Changed search to use CGI::Wiki::Search::DB, as it's simpler
             and doesn't spew weird cleanup errors.
             
             Added character set support, this requires a seperate patch
             to CGI::Wiki to allow the store to support charsets. Made
             the default charset of a new site utf-8.

2004/08/26 - (0.55)
             Fixed "Wanted Pages" that was broken by the 0.54 update -
             thanks to Martin Frost for bug report.

2004/08/12 - (0.54)
             Display home node if asked for nonexistent node.

2004/07/23 - (0.53)
             Fixed bug - formatter name wasn't getting stored for single-
             formatter wikis.  Fixed other bug - HTML wasn't getting
             escaped in comments when listing all versions of a node.

             when preferences cookie will expire.

2004/01/06 - (0.48) Moved the button-press munging out of the CGI and into
             the module, where it belongs.  Improved calling syntax of
             ->process_template.  Added preferences facility for saving
             username.

2003/12/22 - (0.47) After committing an edit we now redirect to the edited
             page rather than just calling the display method in order that
             the URL our browser is pointing at is correct and complete.

             **  If you are upgrading from a version earlier than 0.45,  **

             **************************************************************

2003/12/10 - (0.46) Fixup Build.PL - we don't *really* depend on CGI::Kwiki
             Loads more docs (thanks Schuyler for the prod).  Few fixes to
             the diff thing.

.......... - (0.45) (not released) Ivor Williams' patches to make diffs work.
             CGI::Wiki::Plugin::Diff is now a prerequisite.

2003/11/24 - (0.44) Added ability to specify hostname of database server,
             requested by Jody Belka.  db_user no longer required for
             SQLite backend.

2003/10/10 - (0.43) Fixed test skipping in t/04_multiple_formatter_options.t
             - thanks to Josts Smokehouse for finding the failure.
             Added footer.tt with a little credit in, plus the version.
             Lots of template tweaks to use footer.tt and take advantage of
             not_editable flag.  Couple more stylesheet hooks.

2003/10/03 - (0.42) Fixed edit link for nonexistent nodes.  Made "all pages"
             output be in alphabetical order.  Added some stylesheet hooks
             to the template.  Removed the "revert to this version" link
             from the node.tt template.  Made the content box on the edit
             form be a more sensible size.

2003/09/25 - (0.41) Fix for test failures - we skip the ones that require
             CGI::Wiki::Formatter::Multiple if it's not installed (ta Jost).

2003/09/23 - (0.4) Added multiple formatter support.

                         **** INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE ****

             The way that you tell the module which formatters to use has
             changed.  Please read the documentation in lib/CGI/Wiki/Kwiki.pm
             before upgrading, as you will need to change any existing
             wiki.cgi scripts.

2003/09/22 - (0.31) Tidied up the tests - IO::Stringy no longer needed.
             (0.32) Fixed small bug previously masked by unnecessary
             'use CGI qw( :standard )' line in CGI::Wiki, removed in 0.48.

2003/08/28 - (0.3) Added username/comment support.  Added a start at tests.
             Added support for the 'userstats' action.

2003/07/18 - (0.2) Added search, using Search::InvertedIndex
             (0.21) ..and added the new template to the MANIFEST. Oops.

2003/07/13 - (0.1) Cleaned up some docs, added ability to revert to a previous
             page version. Bumped to 0.1 because I'm in a good mood.

2003/07/12 - Initial release
