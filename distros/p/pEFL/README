pEFL Perl bindings for the Enlightenment Foundation Libraries
================

Perl bindings for the Enlightenment Foundation Libraries (EFL). 
The module gives a nice object-oriented interface. Apart from that 
the API is deliberatly kept close to the Elementary API. The perl 
method names generally remove the prefix at the beginning of the c 
functions. Therefore applying the C documentation should be no problem. 

For the documentation in detail please study the single modules and the 
documentation at https://www.enlightenment.org/docs/start
