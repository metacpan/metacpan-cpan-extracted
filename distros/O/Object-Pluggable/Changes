      reported with hints on how to fix by Jonathan Steinert

    - strict was missing from pluggable. Doh. Kwalitee failure.

0.03  Mon Dec 04 19:01:34 GMT 2006
    - Classic school-boy error. Poco event handlers were clobbering all 
      events.

0.02  Mon Dec 04 18:27:05 GMT 2006
    - The return value of component plugin event handlers now affect
      subsequent processing of events.
