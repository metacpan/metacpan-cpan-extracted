CPAN::Nearest - find the nearest module to a given name.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    
    use CPAN::Nearest 'search';
    my $mod = 'Lingua::Stop::Wars';
    my $pfile = "$ENV{HOME}/.cpan/sources/modules/02packages.details.txt.gz";
    print "Nearest to $mod in $pfile is '", search ($pfile, $mod), "'.\n";
    


produces output

    Nearest to Lingua::Stop::Wars in /home/ben/.cpan/sources/modules/02packages.details.txt.gz is 'Lingua::StopWords'.

=head1 VERSION

This documents CPAN::Nearest version 0.13
corresponding to git commit L<16243f456a77b2cd864ecc6243ce9eef74f89368|https://github.com/benkasminbullock/nearest-module/commit/16243f456a77b2cd864ecc6243ce9eef74f89368> released on Fri Jan 13 10:24:59 2017 +0900.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides a way of searching for CPAN modules whose name
may be misspelt. For example, if a user accidentally types
"Lingua::Stopwords" when looking for the module "Lingua::StopWords",
the common cpan clients will not be able to function:

    cpan Lingua::Stopwords

gives

    Warning: Cannot install Lingua::Stopwords, don't know what it is.
    Try the command

    i /Lingua::Stopwords/

    to find objects with matching identifiers.

and

    cpanm Lingua::Stopwords

gives

    ! Finding Lingua::Stopwords on cpanmetadb failed.
    ! Finding Lingua::Stopwords on search.cpan.org failed.
    ! Finding Lingua::Stopwords () on mirror http://www.cpan.org failed.
    ! Couldn't find module or a distribution Lingua::Stopwords ()

CPAN::Nearest supplies a spelling-mistake tolerant search for the most
similar name, intended for people making tools like C<cpan>, C<cpanm>,
C<pm-uninstall>, and anything else which needs to use the CPAN
packages list. CPAN::Nearest was written to be fast enough for
practical use.

CPAN::Nearest was inspired by the helpful "git" version control
system, which provides suggestions for spelling mistakes.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=head2 search

    my $close_name = search ($file, $module_name);

Search the package detail file C<$file> for a module named
C<$module_name> and return the closest name. E.g. if you search for
"Harry::Potter",

    my $close_name = search ($file, 'Harry::Potter');

the value in C<$close_name>, the closest CPAN module, is
"Data::Lotter".

The file specified by the first argument, C<$file> in the example, is
usually found at F<~/.cpan/sources/modules/02packages.details.txt.gz>
on a Unix-like system. This may be specified as the file name. This
module can read either a compressed or uncompressed version. There is
a speed increase of 10-20% when an uncompressed file is used.

=head1 FILES

Users of the C<cpan> utility supplied with Perl may find the file
listing the CPAN modules in
F<~/.cpan/sources/modules/02packages.details.txt.gz>. Others can
download the file from the directory F</modules/> of any CPAN mirror. 

=head1 STANDALONE PROGRAM

The distribution includes a standalone program called "nearest-module"
as shown in L<this blog
entry|http://blogs.perl.org/users/ben_bullock/2012/06/find-a-misspelt-module-name.html>. To
use this program, edit the file F<nearest-module.c> in the top level
of the distribution to point to the name of the file
F<02packages.details.txt> or F<02packages.details.txt.gz> on your
system, and compile it with

    make -f makeitfile nearest-module

It is run with the name of a single module:

    ./nearest-module Lingo::Jingo::Mojo
    Closest to 'Lingo::Jingo::Mojo' is 'Lingua::JA::Moji'.

There is a C<-v> option to view candidate modules:

    $ ./nearest-module -v Lingo::Jingo::Mojo
    Games::Bingo::Bot (9) is nearer than 10.
    Lingua::JA::Moji (7) is nearer than 9.
    Closest to 'Lingo::Jingo::Mojo' is 'Lingua::JA::Moji'.
