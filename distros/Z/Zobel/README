README file for the Zobel LiveGe'ez RPP Implementation.

	Zobel is a collection of modules and a front end CGI script that
	implement the LiveGe'ez Remote Processing Protocol specification.
	At this stage Zobel implements on the CGI query services fully
	and will (soon) be compliant with the HTML markup specification.
	Latest Zobel hype/summary:   http://libeth.netpedia.net/Zobel/

 	Definitive info on the LiveGe'ez Remote Processing Protocol is
 	found at:  http://libeth.netpedia.net/LiveGeez.html

	If you do not intend to process Ethiopic web documents on remote
	servers, this package will not be very useful for you.

	Prerequisites for Zobel are the modules  LWP::Simple, HTML::Entities,
	Convert::Ethiopic, and the old chestnut "cgi-lib.pl" and "cookies.pl"
	which have been included in the "bin" directory.


	Module LiveGeez::Request

		Instantiates an object that contains a parsed LiveGe'ez query.
		The request object is required by any other LiveGe'ez function
		of object.

	Module LiveGeez::Services

		Services.pm provides request processing services for a LiveGe'ez
		query as specified in the LiveGe'ez Remote Processing Protocol.
		"ProcessRequest" takes a LiveGe'ez LiveGeez::Request object and
		performs the appropriate service.
	
	Module LiveGeez::File

		Instantiates an object for processing an Ethiopic text or HTML
		document.  The constructor requires a LiveGeez::Request object
		as an argument.

	Module LiveGeez::Cgi

		Instantiates an object for processing an Ethiopic text or HTML

	Program LiveGeez::HTML

		Provides the routines for conversion of HTML document content
		between Ethiopic encoding systems and for pre-interpretation of
		HTML markups for compliance with the LiveGe'ez Remote Processing
		Protocol.

	Program LiveGeez::CacheAsSERA

		Provides the routines for conversion of HTML document content
		from Ethiopic encoding systems into SERA for document caching and
		later conversion into other Ethiopic systems.

	Program LiveGeez::Local

		The required module by all other LiveGe'ez modules.  Local.pm
		contains site specific settings for default encoding systems,
		language, and paths.

	Program Z.pl:

		The front end of the "Zobel" implementation of the LiveGe'ez Remote
		Processing Protocol.  The expected and intended use is via CGI query,
		however the Z.pl script is serviceable at the command line as well.


Installation:
	Obtain and install Convert::Ethiopic from where you found Zobel.
    LibEth is required:  http://libeth.netpedia.net

	Download the tar.gz, unpack it, change to the Zobel-*
	directory. Then do

		Edit LiveGeez/Local.pm and bin/cookies.pl
		perl Makefile.PL
		make
		make install

	The scripts in "bin" are not automatically installed - you will probably
	want to install it in the appropriate place for CGI service on your system
	(vs /usr/local/bin etc.)

Available:
	ftp://ftp.ethiopic.org/pub/perl-unicode/ and from your
	favorite CPAN site in the authors/id/D/DY/DYACOB/ directory.
