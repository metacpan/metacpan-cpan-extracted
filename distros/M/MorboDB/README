VERSION
    version 1.000000

SYNOPSIS
            use MorboDB;

            # MorboDB usage is meant to refelect MongoDB usage

            my $morbo = MorboDB->new;
            my $database = $morbo->get_database('my_database');
            my $collection = $database->get_collection('users');

            my $id = $collection->insert({
                    username => 'someguy98',
                    password => 's3cr3t',
                    email => 'email at address dot com',
            });

DESCRIPTION
    MorboDB is an in-memory database, meant to be a mostly-compatible clone
    of Perl's MongoDB driver, in such a way that it can be used to replace
    or even supplement MongoDB in applications where it might be useful.

  USE CASES
    An in-memory database can be useful for many purposes. A common use case
    is testing purposes, where using a "physical" database might be onerous.
    You can already find a few in-memory databases on CPAN, such as MMapDB,
    DB_File (has optional support for in-memory databases) and KiokuDB
    (which has an in-memory hash serializer). I'm sure there are others
    more.

    I decided to develop MorboDB for two main purposes:

    *   MongoDB disaster fallback: at work I am currently developing a very
        critical application that uses MongoDB (with replica-sets setup) as
        a database backend. This application cannot afford to suffer
        downtimes. The application's database has some constant data (not
        too much) that shouldn't change which is completely required for it
        to work. Most of the data, however, is dynamically written due to
        user's work and is not as important, so it wouldn't matter if the
        database won't be able to take such writes for some time.

        Therefore, I have decided to build a fail-safe: when the application
        is launched (actually I haven't decided yet if on launch or not),
        the constant data is loaded into MorboDB, which silently waits in
        the background. If for some reason the MongoDB database crashes, the
        application switches to MorboDB and the application continues to
        work - the users don't even notice something happend. Since MorboDB
        provides mostly the same syntax as MongoDB, this isn't very
        far-fetched codewise.

    *   Delayed writes and undos: I am also working on a content management
        system in which I want to allow users to undo changes for a certain
        duration (say 30 seconds) after the changes have been made. MorboDB
        can work as a bridge between the application and the actual MongoDB
        database (or whatever actually). So the data will only live in
        MorboDB for 30 seconds, and if the user decides to undo, the data is
        removed and nothing happens. Otherwise, the data is moved to MongoDB
        after the 30 seconds are over.

  MOSTLY-COMPATIBLE?
    As I've mentioned, MorboDB is *mostly-compatible* with MongoDB. First of
    all, a lot of things that are relevant for MongoDB are not relevant for
    in-memory database. Some things aren't supported and probably never
    will, like GridFS for example. Otherwise, the syntax is almost
    completely the same (by relying on MQUL), apart for some changes
    detailed in both "NOTABLE_DIFFERENCES_FROM_MONGODB" in MQUL::Reference
    and "INCOMPATIBILITIES WITH MONGODB".

    I have provided most methods provided by relevant MongoDB modules, even
    where they're not really implemented (in which case they either return 1
    or an undefined value). Read the documentation of MorboDB's different
    modules for information on every method and whether it's implemented or
    not. These methods are only provided to make it possible to use MorboDB
    as a drop-in replacement of MongoDB where appropriate (so you don't get
    "undefined subroutine" errors). Please let me know if there are methods
    you need (even unimplemented) that I haven't provided.

    Note that autoloading of database and collection objects has been
    deprecated since version 1.0.0, in accordance with MongoDB.

  STATUS
    This module is beta software, not suitable for production use yet. Feel
    free to test it and let me know how it works for you (of course, not on
    production), I'd be happy to receive any bug reports, requests, ideas,
    etc.

OBJECT METHODS
  database_names()
    Returns a list with the names of all existing databases.

  get_database( $name )
    Returns a MorboDB::Database object with the given name:

            my $morbodb = MorboDB->new;
        
            my $db = $morbodb->get_database('mydb');

  get_master()
    Not implemented, simply returns a true value here.

CAVEATS
    Currently (not sure if this will change), MorboDB does not work in
    shared memory, so if your application is multi-threaded, every thread
    will have its own MorboDB container completely separate and unaware of
    other threads.

DIAGNOSTICS
    This module throws the following errors:

    "You must provide the name of the database to get."
        Thrown by "get_database()" if you don't provide it with the name of
        the database you want to get/create.

CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT
    MorboDB requires no configuration files or environment variables.

DEPENDENCIES
    MorboDB depends on the following CPAN modules:

    *   boolean

    *   Clone

    *   Data::UUID

    *   Moo

    *   MQUL

    *   Tie::IxHash

INCOMPATIBILITIES WITH MONGODB
    While I hope to make MorboDB as much of a clone of the MongoDB driver as
    possible (syntax and usage-wise), some changes are inevitable.
    Currently, only the most essential features of the MongoDB distribution
    are implemented. That means you can insert documents as you would with
    MongoDB, update documents and remove documents. You can find documents
    and work with cursor pretty much the same, including sorting and other
    cursor modifications.

    Syntaxwise, any differences between MorboDB and MongoDB stem from the
    usage of MQUL as the parser, so read the MQUL documentation for a list
    of differences.

    Another difference worth noting is with OIDs. In MongoDB, OIDs (the
    automatic ones at least) are 24 characters long hexadecimal strings, and
    are created by the MongoDB::OID module. In MorboDB, however, OIDs (also,
    only the automatic ones) are 36 characters long UUIDs. This alone limits
    your ability to use MorboDB alongside MongoDB in an application if you
    perform queries on the "_id" attribute with known MongoDB::OID objects.
    Other than that, this shouldn't really be a problem.

    Featurewise, most differences should be missing or unimplemented methods
    (and a few missing classes). I have taken some care not to miss any
    methods provided by the MongoDB distribution, but I may have missed
    some. Where methods are unimplemented, MorboDB will simply return a true
    or false value (as appropriate). Please read the documentation of each
    MorboDB module to learn what to expect from unimplemented methods (and
    implemented methods of course).

    Some features that are native to MongoDB itself (and not just the
    MongoDB distribution on CPAN) will never be implemented in MorboDB (most
    of them don't even make sense in an in-memory database).

    Here's a (probably incomplete) list of MongoDB features missing from
    MongoDB:

    *   Authentication

    *   Indexing (may be supported in the future, don't think so though)

    *   Replication

    *   Sharding

    *   Map/Reduce

    *   GridFS

INCOMPATIBILITIES WITH OTHER MODULES
    None reported.
