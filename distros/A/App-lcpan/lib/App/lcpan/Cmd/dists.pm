Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

=over 4

=item * B<author> => I<str>

Filter by author.

=item * B<cpan> => I<dirname>

Location of your local CPAN mirror, e.g. /path/to/cpan.

Defaults to C<~/cpan>.

=item * B<detail> => I<bool>

=item * B<has_buildpl> => I<bool>

=item * B<has_makefilepl> => I<bool>

=item * B<has_metajson> => I<bool>

=item * B<has_metayml> => I<bool>

=item * B<has_multiple_rels> => I<bool>

=item * B<index_name> => I<filename> (default: "index.db")

Filename of index.

If C<index_name> is a filename without any path, e.g. C<index.db> then index will
be located in the top-level of C<cpan>. If C<index_name> contains a path, e.g.
C<./index.db> or C</home/ujang/lcpan.db> then the index will be located solely
using the C<index_name>.

=item * B<latest> => I<bool>

=item * B<or> => I<bool>

When there are more than one query, perform OR instead of AND logic.

=item * B<query> => I<array[str]>

Search query.

=item * B<query_type> => I<str> (default: "any")

=item * B<rel_mtime_newer_than> => I<date>

=item * B<sort> => I<array[str]> (default: ["dist"])

Sort the result.
