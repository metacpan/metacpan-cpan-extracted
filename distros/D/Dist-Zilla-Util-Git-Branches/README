NAME
    Dist::Zilla::Util::Git::Branches - Extract branches from Git

VERSION
    version 0.001000

SYNOPSIS
    This module aims to do what you want when you think you want to parse
    the output of

        git branch

    Except it works the right way, and uses

        git for-each-ref

    So

        use Dist::Zilla::Util::Git::Branches;

        my $branches = Dist::Zilla::Util::Git::Branches->new(
            zilla => $self->zilla
        );
        for my $branch ( $branches->branches ) {
            printf "%s %s", $branch->name, $branch->sha1;
        }

METHODS
  "branches"
    Returns a "::Branch" object for each local branch.

  get_branch
    Get branch info about master

        my $branch = $branches->get_branch('master');

    Note: This can easily return multiple values.

    For instance, "branches" is implemented as

        my ( @branches ) = $branches->get_branch('**');

    Mostly, because the underlying mechanism is implemented in terms of
    fnmatch(3)

    If the branch does not exist, or no branches match the expression,
    "get_branch" will return an empty list.

    So in the top example, $branch is "undef" if "master" does not exist.

  "current_branch"
    Returns a "::Branch" object if currently on a "branch", "undef"
    otherwise.

        my $b = $branches->current_branch;
        if ( defined $b ) {
            printf "Currently on: %s", $b->name;
        } else {
            print "Detached HEAD";
        }
