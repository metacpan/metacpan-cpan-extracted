NAME
    Crypt::OpenSSL::Verify - OpenSSL Verify certificate verification in XS.

SYNOPSIS
      use Crypt::OpenSSL::Verify;
      use Crypt::OpenSSL::X509;

      my $ca = Crypt::OpenSSL::Verify->new(
          't/cacert.pem', # or undef
          {
              CApath   => '/etc/ssl/certs',    # Optional
              noCAfile => 1,                   # Optional
              noCApath => 0                    # Optional
          }
      );

      # Backward compatible with Crypt::OpenSSL:VerifyX509
      my $ca = Crypt::OpenSSL::Verify->new('t/cacert.pem');

      # Using the defaults of your OS:
      my $ca = Crypt::OpenSSL::Verify->new();

      # and later on..

      my $cert = Crypt::OpenSSL::X509->new(...);
      $ca->verify($cert);

    The object created is similar to running the following command with the
    "openssl verify" command line tool: "openssl verify [ -CApath
    /path/to/certs ] [ -noCApath ] [ -noCAfile ] [ -CAfile /path/to/file ]
    cert.pem"

DESCRIPTION
    Given a CA certificate and another untrusted certificate, will show
    whether the CA signs the certificate. This is a useful thing to have if
    you're signing with X509 certificates, but outside of SSL.

    A specific example is where you're working with XML signatures, and need
    to verify that the signing certificate is valid.

METHODS
  new()
    Constructor. Returns an OpenSSL Verify instance, set up with the given
    CA.

        my $ca = Crypt::OpenSSL::Verify->new(
            't/cacert.pem',   # or undef
            {
                # Path to a directory containg hashed CA Certificates
                CApath => $ca_path,

                # Default CAfile should not be loaded if TRUE, defaults to FALSE
                noCAfile => 0,

                # Default CApath should not be loaded if TRUE, defaults to FALSE
                noCApath => 0,

                # Do not override any OpenSSL verify errors if FALSE, defaults to TRUE
                strict_certs => 1,
            }
        );

        # Backward compatible with Crypt::OpenSSL:VerifyX509
        my $ca = Crypt::OpenSSL::Verify->new('t/cacert.pem', {strict_certs => 0 });

        # Using the defaults of your OS:
        my $ca = Crypt::OpenSSL::Verify->new();

  verify($cert)
    Verify the certificate is signed by the CA. Returns true if so, and
    croaks with the verification error if not.

    Arguments:

     * $cert - a Crypt::OpenSSL::X509 object for the certificate to verify.

  ctx_error_code($ctx)
    Calls the C code to obtain the OpenSSL error code of the verify and
    returns an integer value

    Arguments:

      * $ctx - a long unsigned integer containing the  pointer to the
            X509_STORE_CTX that was passed to the callback function
            during the certificate verification

  register_verify_cb(\&verify_callback);
    Registers a Perl Sub as the callback function for OpenSSL to call during
    the registration process

    Arguments:

      * \&verify_callback - a reference to the verify_callback sub

  verify_callback($ok, $ctx)
    Called directly by OpenSSL and in the case of an acceptable error will
    change the response to 1 to signify no error

    Arguments:

      $ok - Error (0) or Success (1) from the OpenSSL certificate verification
            results

      $ctx - value of the pointer to the Certificate Store CTX used to access the
            error codes that OpenSSL returned
