NAME

    Blockchain::Ethereum - A Ethereum toolkit in Perl

VERSION

    version 0.019

DESCRIPTION

    A Ethereum toolkit written in Perl, combining core utilities for
    working with Ethereum's internal data structures.

    This distribution merges the functionality of previously separate
    modules into a single toolkit, including:

      * ABI encoding and decoding

      * RLP serialization

      * Transaction creation and signing

      * Keystore encryption and decryption

    These modules are now bundled together in a single distribution to
    simplify usage, packaging, and long-term maintenance.
