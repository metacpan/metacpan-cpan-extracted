3.013     2021-04-27 10:28:39+08:00 Asia/Kuala_Lumpur
    No new features.

    Bugs fixed:

    - removed `dynamically` usage for `$log->{context}` since it can trigger a
    memory leak and also affects performance, see:
    https://github.com/binary-com/perl-Myriad/issues/117 for an example

3.012     2021-04-22 21:26:23+08:00 Asia/Kuala_Lumpur
    New features:

    - automatic connection and queuing is now more reliable, you should only
    need `await $redis->connected` in a few cases now
    - acess to client-side invalidation events, for implementing observables
    - enable keyspace notifications in cluster mode

    Bugs fixed:

    - various issues with client-side caching resolved
    - in cluster mode, XREAD could fail due to incorrect node lookup for key
    (Github #23, thanks to Marc Frank for the patch)
    - the stream read/write lengths were using the same internal key,
    so any changes to one value would affect the other as well
    - XINFO was mapping to the wrong key in cluster mode, thanks to Eyad for
    catching and fixing this

3.011     2021-02-03 03:43:05+08:00 Asia/Kuala_Lumpur
    New features:

    - ->failover added from latest commands list

3.010     2021-02-01 04:56:52+08:00 Asia/Kuala_Lumpur
    New features:

    - ->bootstrap will now fail if the cluster's nodes addresses are not initiated.
    - cluster->execute_command will now redirect the command to the correct node 
      if 'MOVED' error received.
    - latest commands from 6.2
    - this includes ->getdel, ->getex, ->zrandfield

3.009     2021-01-27 06:33:18+08:00 Asia/Kuala_Lumpur
    No new features.

    Bugs fixed:

    - `XGROUP` KEY_FINDER index was wrong.
    - `PUBLISH`/`SUBSCRIBE` were not in the KEY_FINDER index.
    - Net::Async::Redis::Cluster was ignoring the protocol compatibility layer.

3.008     2021-01-17 01:29:19+08:00 Asia/Kuala_Lumpur
    New features:

    - latest commands from 6.2
    - this includes ->xautoclaim, ->client_unpause and the `count => 'any'` option
    on various commands

3.007     2020-12-31 07:23:30+08:00 Asia/Kuala_Lumpur
    New features:

    - latest commands from 6.2
    - this includes ->geosearch, ->client_info, ->client_trackinginfo etc.

3.006     2020-12-04 05:33:59+08:00 Asia/Kuala_Lumpur
    New features:

    - latest commands from 6.0.9
    - ->copy is now supported (from latest Redis release)
    - stream handling now documents `MKSTREAM` and `NOMKSTREAM`,
    and updates the trimming to mention `~` (approximate) and `=`
    (exact) modes for removing old entries

3.005     2020-11-16 05:20:49+08:00 Asia/Kuala_Lumpur
    New features:

    - ->zdiff and ->zdiffstore commands from latest Redis release
    - provide RESP2/RESP3 compatibility when hashrefs option is not enabled,
    otherwise some commands such as ->xreadgroup can return inconsistent
    results between versions (thanks Eyad, Paul and Nael for the patch)
    - cluster mode now provides basic slot calculation caching, since this
    yields a small performance improvement

3.004     2020-11-04 12:40:40+08:00 Asia/Kuala_Lumpur
    No new features.

    Bugs fixed:

    - top-level hashes also now follow the `hashrefs` configuration option,
    this affects methods such as `->xreadgroup`.

3.003     2020-11-03 13:58:00+08:00 Asia/Kuala_Lumpur
    No new features.

    Bugs fixed:

    - RESP3 protocol changes (enabled by default in earlier versions of this module)
    meant that you'd end up with hashrefs or arrayrefs depending on what version
    of Redis you were connecting to. This behaviour is now controlled by the
    `hashrefs` configuration option, and is disabled by default even under RESP3.

3.002     2020-10-12 00:19:11+08:00 Asia/Kuala_Lumpur
    New features:

    - latest commands from 6.0.8, including LMOVE/BLMOVE

3.001     2020-09-22 01:51:28+08:00 Asia/Kuala_Lumpur
    New features:

    - RESP3 no longer establishes a separate client-side caching connection,
    since it can share the main connection
    - `AUTH username password` from latest Redis now supported

    Bugs fixed:

    - proper differentiation between regular arrays and pubsub messages
    when in pubsub mode on a RESP3 connection
    - avoid establishing client-side caching connection until we need one,
    could also have resulted in an attempt to connect to the wrong Redis server
    if using `->configure(host => ...); ->configure(port => ...);`
    - on a failure, continue with next item in pipeline - otherwise subsequent
    requests would get stuck

3.000     2020-09-14 02:00:10+08:00 Asia/Kuala_Lumpur
    New features:

    - RESP3 support, for Redis 6
    - pubsub is now allowed on the same connection as
    other traffic if the connection is in RESP3 mode
    - protocol is autodetected via `HELLO` command,
    pass `protocol => 'resp2'` to disable this

2.007     2020-09-05 02:08:25+08:00 Asia/Kuala_Lumpur
    New features:

    - applies client_name on connection if configured
    - opentracing can be controlled by `->configure(opentracing => 1 || 0)`

    Note that OpenTracing support is now *disabled* by default, since it
    incurs a small (~5%) performance penalty. The USE_OPENTRACING env var
    is still supported for enabling/disabling globally.

2.006     2020-08-26 10:23:47+08:00 Asia/Kuala_Lumpur
    New features:

    - latest command updates from Redis 6.0.6 - main change here is ->lpos
    renaming "first" to "rank", see https://redis.io/commands/lpos
    - Redis database selection via URI or `database` ->configure parameter
    - OpenTracing support via OpenTracing::Any

2.005     2020-06-28 00:20:52+08:00 Asia/Kuala_Lumpur
    New features:

    - LPOS method added from latest Redis release

    Bugs fixed:

    - URI parameter without `redis://` prefix is now upgraded,
    allowing `->new(uri => 'localhost:1234')` (Github issue #7,
    thanks LeoNerd)
    - pipelining encoding bug (Github issue #14, thanks to dankroboth
    for reporting and highlighting the faulty code)

2.004_001 2020-06-01 06:46:51+08:00 Asia/Kuala_Lumpur (TRIAL RELEASE)
    New features:

    - initial client-side caching support for ->get calls,
    pass client_side_caching_size => $size to enable.
    Please note that this key is likely to change in a future version.

    No new features.

    Bugs fixed:

    - the ->multi return value was a nested Future, changing the result
    compared to previous versions - thanks to Nael for reporting
    - subscribe/psubscribe interleaved with ping or other requests
    could get confused about the pending queue

2.002_004 2020-04-23 02:19:48+08:00 Asia/Kuala_Lumpur (TRIAL RELEASE)
    New features:

    - pipeline parameter now does something, set to 0 to allow "unlimited"
    pipelined requests (as in keep trying until the Redis server stops listening
    to process the backlog)

2.002_003 2020-04-23 01:59:30+08:00 Asia/Kuala_Lumpur (TRIAL RELEASE)

    - now requires Future::AsyncAwait

1.014     2019-02-04 02:05:21+08:00 Asia/Kuala_Lumpur
    New features:

    - increase default buffer sizes from 8KB to 1MB, to improve efficiency
    in the common case where there are only a few active Redis connections

    No new features.

    Bug fixes:

    - The connection was cached even if connection failed/interrupted so reconnecting
    attempts were failing as well, now the connection object will get deleted on failure
    - Subscriptions were not cancelled when the connection being interrupted,
    now they are cancelled properly

    (thanks to Eyad Arnabeh for reporting and fixing)

1.007     2018-09-05 10:11:44+08:00 Asia/Kuala_Lumpur

    Bug fixes:

    - Support auth parameter, rather than insisting on auth information be passed as
    part of the URI (thanks to Nael Alolwani for reporting)
    - "Pipeline depth" notifications were logged at `info` level, these are an internal
    diagnostic and not useful for application code, these are now `trace` level messages

1.006     2018-07-12 22:39:10+08:00 Asia/Kuala_Lumpur
    No new features.

    Bug fixes:

    - PSUBSCRIBE wasn't working (reported by Bill Marriott and leonerd, fix+tests by leonerd,
    I did little more than hit the merge button - thanks!)

    Dependencies:

    - Math::Random::Secure dep was missing (thanks MANWAR!)

1.005     2018-01-06 18:18:22+08:00 Asia/Kuala_Lumpur
    No new features.

    Dependencies:

    No new features.

    Performance improvements:

    - DISCARD/EXEC are now pipelined, we don't need to wait for the
    write before sending more commands


1.003     2017-12-26 18:00:36+08:00 Asia/Kuala_Lumpur
    New features:

    - support queuing for MULTI and other commands
    - support for passing a Redis URI
    - minor performance improvements in protocol implementation and event handling

    Bugs fixed:

    - it was possible for cancelled/failed items within ->multi to cause the protocol
    handling to go out of sync, this is now fixed.
    - multi-word commands were generated incorrectly, these now work again

    Examples:

    - `examples/job-hash-worker.pl` - reliable priority-queue worker with job
    details in separate hash key
    - `examples/job-hash-submit.pl` - submit requests for priority-queue workers


1.002     2017-12-11 06:06:47+08:00 Asia/Kuala_Lumpur
    Dependencies:

    - Explicit Log::Any dependency to ensure that context support is available

    New features:

    New features:

    - Support for MULTI transactions via ->multi method

    Examples:

    - `examples/job-worker.pl` - Simple list-based job queue
    - `examples/multi.pl` - Transaction using MULTI

1.000     2017-12-09 16:51:40+08:00 Asia/Kuala_Lumpur
    First stable release. Note that there are some API changes, but
    previous code should work mostly unmodified.

    New features:

    - Dropped Protocol::Redis in favour of local implementation
    - Separated out commands into an autogenerated class to make
    it easier to keep up to date with protocol changes
    - Better support for subscriptions (see `examples/pub|sub.pl`)
    - Dropped JSON::MaybeXS and Mixin::Event::Dispatch deps, events
    are now handled through Ryu

    Known issues:

    - All data is assumed to be binary, callers need their own
    Encode::encode()/::decode() calls - future versions are likely
    to include an `->encoding` setting and/or `_utf8` versions of
    string methods.

0.003     2015-11-15 03:16:27+00:00 Europe/London
