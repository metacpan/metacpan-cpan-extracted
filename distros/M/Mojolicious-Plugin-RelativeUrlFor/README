Mojolicious::Plugin::RelativeUrlFor - relative links in Mojolicious, really.

This plugin adds two useful helpers to Mojolicious, that help you using URLs
relative to the request URL: relative_url_for and rel_url_for. It's also
possible to replace the url_for helper which influences link_to and form_for.

Installation:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

Basic usage:

    # Mojolicious
    $self->plugin('RelativeUrlFor');

    # Mojolicious::Lite
    plugin 'RelativeUrlFor';

    # In your actions:
    $rel_url = $self->rel_url_for('foo', bar => 'baz');

    # In your templates:
    <%= rel_url_for 'foo', bar => 'baz' %>

For more informations, see the inlined POD documentation in
lib/Mojolicious/Plugin/RelativeUrlFor.pm or view it in the terminal with
