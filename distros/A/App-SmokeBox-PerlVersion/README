SYNOPSIS
      use strict;
      use warnings;
      use POE;
      use App::SmokeBox::PerlVersion;

      my $perl = shift || $^X;

      POE::Session->create(
        package_states => [
          main => [qw(_start _result)],
        ],
      );

      $poe_kernel->run();
      exit 0;

      sub _start {
        App::SmokeBox::PerlVersion->version(
          perl => $perl,
          event => '_result',
        );
        return;
      }

      sub _result {
        my $href = $_[ARG0];
        print "Perl version: ", $href->{version}, "\n";
        print "Built for:    ", $href->{archname}, "\n";
        print "OS Version:   ", $href->{osvers}, "\n";
        return;
      }

DESCRIPTION
    App::SmokeBox::PerlVersion is a simple helper module for
    App::SmokeBox::Mini and minismokebox that determines version,
    architecture and OS version of a given "perl" executable.

CONSTRUCTOR
    "version"
        Takes a number of arguments:

          'perl', the perl executable to query, defaults to $^X;
          'event', the event to trigger in the calling session on finish;
          'session', a POE Session, ID, alias or postback to send results to;
          'context', optional context data you want to provide;

        "event" is a mandatory argument unless "session" is provided and is
        a POE postback/callback.

RESPONSE
    An "event" or "postback" will be sent when the module has finished with
    a hashref of data.

    For "event" the hashref will be in "ARG0".

    For "postback" the hashref will be the first item in the arrayref of
    "ARG1" in the "postback".

    The hashref will contain the following keys:

      'exitcode', the exit code of the perl executable that was run;
      'version', the perl version string;
      'archname', the perl archname string;
      'osvers', the OS version string;
      'context', whatever was passed to version();
