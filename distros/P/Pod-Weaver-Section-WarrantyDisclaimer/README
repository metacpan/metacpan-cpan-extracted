NAME
    Pod::Weaver::Section::WarrantyDisclaimer - Add a standard DISCLAIMER OF
    WARRANTY section (for your Perl module)

VERSION
    version 0.121290

SYNOPSIS
    In weaver.ini, probably near the end:

        [WarrantyDisclaimer]

OVERVIEW
    This section plugin will add a standard DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY section
    to your POD. See the bottom of this module's documentation for the
    content of this section.

    Note that there are several other warranty texts available that
    correspond to the text used in various open-source licenses, such as
    Pod::Weaver::Section::WarrantyDisclaimer::GPL2. If your code's license
    has a specific warranty clause, you should try to use the corresponding
    module, so that the warranty text in your modules will match that of the
    license. If a warranty disclaimer module is not provided for your
    license of choice, you can easily create one by subclassing this class
    and overriding the methods "warranty_section_title" and "warranty_text".
    Alternatively, you can simply use "[WarrantyDisclaimer::Custom]" and
    then use the "title" and "text" options to specify your custom warranty.

METHODS
  warranty_section_title
    This method provides the text to be used as the title of the warranty
    section. It can be overridden by subclasses to provide different
    warranties.

  warranty_text
    This method provides the text to be used in the warranty section. It can
    be overridden by subclasses to provide different warranties.

INSTALLATION
    See perlmodinstall for information and options on installing Perl
    modules.
