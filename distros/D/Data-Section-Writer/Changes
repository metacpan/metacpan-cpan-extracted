  - The update_file method will replace the content in an existing file
    rather than creating a new one.  A backup of the original file is
    made while the new content is being written, in the unlikely event
    of an error during content replacement.  The backup will be removed
    if the replacement succeeds.  A new file will be created if one does
    not exist, as before.  (gh#6)
