GSAPI version 0.3 (heavily untested)
=================

This module provides an interface to the gsapi
functions of GNU Gostscript.

You normally won't need this module, it's far easier
to pipe to gs under Unix.

You need libgs - which is normally available under most Linux Distributions
as ghostscript-devel or equivalent - and the ghostscript header files, see
INSTALL.

You normally want to use the tie-method, here an example:

my $output;
{ local *FH;
   tie *FH, "GSAPI", stdout => sub { $output .= $_[0]; length $_[0]};
   print FH "12345679 9 mul pstack quit\n";
}

ok($output =~ /111111111/);



INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL CCFLAGS=-I/path-to/gnu_ghostscript-8.15/src
   make
   make test
   make install
