0.212   2023-05-12  Released-By: PERLANCAR; Urgency: high

        - [bugfix] Fix another instance of gettimeofday() invocation.


0.211   2023-05-12  Released-By: PERLANCAR; Urgency: high

        - [bugfix] Fix invocation of gettimeofday() to get correct result
          (mistake not detected early because we are not using stricture?).


0.210   2023-05-01  Released-By: PERLANCAR; Urgency: medium; Backward-Incompatible: yes

        [INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES]

        - We now do not hide any modules from being listed, to avoid being
          deceptive by accident.

        - We are now more minimalistic and avoid loading any module by default,
          including 'strict', 'warnings', and 'Time::HiRes'. This means by
          default time is measured using builtin time() which only has 1-second
          precision. To enable subsecond precision, explicitly set 'time_hires'
          option to true.

        - Rename environment variable DEVELENDSTATS_OPTS to
          PERL_DEVEL_ENDSTATS_OPTS.

        [ENHANCEMENTS]

        - Add option 'debug'.


0.20    2015-03-26  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- [ux] Show program runtime in ms too.


0.19    2015-01-03  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- No functional changes.

	- Rebuild (Generate TODO.md).


0.18    2014-11-13  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- No functional changes.

	- Avoid the use of defined-or operator because we still allow
	  5.8/earlier perls [CT].


0.17    2014-11-09  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- No functional changes.

	- Typo in checking 'time' sort order.


0.16    2014-11-09  Released-By: PERLANCAR

        - Don't show warning when encountering file '-e' in %INC (I encountered
          this when using Moo, where this pair shows up: 'main.pm' => '-e').


0.15    2014-08-21  Released-By: SHARYANTO

        [BUG FIXES]

        - Sorting fixes.

        - Return 1 if module already loaded (listed in %INC), not 0. This caused
          problem with code like: 'eval "require $mod" or die ...' (even though
          it is advised that one does 'eval "require $mod; 1" or die ...').


0.14    2014-05-18  Released-By: SHARYANTO

        - Add option: show_memsize.


0.13    2014-05-09  Released-By: SHARYANTO; Note: Happy birthday, Jinny!

        - Add option 'force'.


0.10    2012-10-18  Released-By: SHARYANTO

        - No functional changes. Tweak warning message and avoid perl undef
          warning.


0.09    2012-10-04  Released-By: SHARYANTO

        - No functional changes. Fix a typo, avoid perl undef warning, and add a
          helpful warning message when Devel::EndStats is loaded late.


0.08    2012-07-27  Released-By: SHARYANTO

        - No functional changes

0.06    2012-07-26  Released-By: SHARYANTO
