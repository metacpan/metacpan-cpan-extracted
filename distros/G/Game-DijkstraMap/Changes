        New BUILD code that calls map() xor str2map() for easier object
        setup. next* methods return array reference instead of list to
        make them more like other methods. New unconnected() and
        values() methods. Learn more about normalize_costs (it does not
        do diagonals). Add next_m to set what next method to call
        instead of that being an argument to various next_* methods. New
        dimap_with() and next_with() for weights in combination with
        other map objects. And to_tsv() to help debug those.

        Add recalc() method (update() now makes no such effort as it
        cannot) and related commentary about these methods in the
        perldocs. Also new str2map() utility method.
