	- a little better installation under Windows [André Joost]

	  Contributed by [Michael R. Davis]

	- improved output of examples/test_list.pl

	- do not list latlong/longlat/geocent as projections,
	  because "proj -l" doesn't either.

	- tested with 4.6.1

version 1.00: Thu Oct  2 23:27:31 CEST 2008

	- XS should use Safefree(), not free().  Marvellous fix
	  by rt.cpan.org#39749 [Dan Stahlke]

version 0.99: Fri Jun  8 17:08:40 CEST 2007

	- EPGS -> EPSG in example script [Michael R. Davis]

	- added t/pod.t

version 0.98: Fri Mar  9 14:16:09 CET 2007

	- moved eg/ to examples/, probably easier to find.

	- added examples/use_epsg.pl, and use of epgs files in synopsis.
	  Thanks to [Michael R. Davis]  Translated POD in script to text,
	  to avoid search.cpan.org to index it as package documentation.

	- converted production of manual pages to use oodist, which
	  eliminated the need for the mkdist, mkdoc, version files,
	  but added PODTAIL.txt and text to Makefile.PL

	- renamed test_list into examples/test_list.pl

	- removed use of ppport.h, which is probably not used.

	- added documentation for the two error messages.

version 0.97: Sat Nov  4 12:14:22 CET 2006
	- Avoid double free() on DESTROY by simply forgetting to free
	  the memory.  Of course this leaks, which should be fixed in
	  next release.

	- added projection() and datum()
	- renamed or datum(), ellipsoid(), and unit() into ....Info()

	- create manual page with OODoc, to be able to integrate it with
	  Geo::Point docs.
