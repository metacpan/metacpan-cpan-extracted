NAME
    Devel::CoverReport - Advanced Perl code coverage report generator

SYNOPSIS
    To get coverage report, from existing *cover_db* database, use:

      cover_report

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides advanced reports based on Devel::Cover database.

WARNING
    Consider this module to be an early ALPHA. It does the job for me, so
    it's here.

    This is my first CPAN module, so I expect that some things may be a bit
    rough around edges.

    The plan is, to fix both those issues, and remove this warning in next
    immediate release.

API
    new Constructor for "Devel::CoverReport".

    make_report
        Make the report, as it was specified during object construction.

        Most probably, this is the only method, that most users will have to
        call, if they want to use this module directly.

        The rest will either run prove_cover (it's still the recomended way)
        or hack deeper - if, for some reason, You just need parts of this
        module.

    validate_digest
        Check if there are some issues, that would not allow a digest to be
        edded to the report. In case such issues exist, digest has to be
        re-classified, and it's analise abandoned.

        Parameters: (ARRAY) $self $structure_data : digest's structure data.

        Returns: $new_classification : string (like: MISSING, CHANGED) or
        undef (if no issues ware detected).

    classify_file
        Determine, if file (identified by it's path) should be INCLUDE-d,
        MENTION-ed or EXCLUDE-d.

        Parameters: (ARRAY) $self $file_path

        Returns: $classification_string - one of the: "INCLUDE", "MENTION",
        "EXCLUDE".

    classify_file
        Internal function.

        Backend for "classify_file", iterate over every possible
        classification method.

        Parameters: (ARRAY) $self $file_path

        Returns: $classification_string - one of the: "INCLUDE", "MENTION",
        "EXCLUDE".

    analyse_digest
        Prepare detailed reports related to coverage or single module, and
        return some metadata, used later to make a report-wide summary.

        Parameters: (ARRAY) $self $runs - array of run IDs, that are related
        to this file (runs, that cover this file) $digest - file's ID,
        assigned to it by Devel::Cover

        Returns: nothing

    make_generic_summary
        Prepare table, which shows, for each metric: - coverable items -
        covered items - coverage (in percent)

        Parameters: ($self + HASH) item_summary - data for the summary row

    make_runs_details
        Parameters: ($self + HASH) digest - digest of the file, for which to
        prepare run details report structure_data run_hits - per-run part of
        the %hits hash per_run_info source_lines - array ref, containing
        covereg file's contents - line by line. item_summary - data for the
        summary row

    make_coverage_summary
        Make coverage information report for single structure entiry (Perl
        script or module).

        Parameters: ($self + HASH) structure_data hits report_id - string:
        'namified' file path with run ID (if per-run coverages are turned
        ON) source_lines - array ref, containing covereg file's contents -
        line by line. item_summary - data for the summary row

    _make_per_line_criterions
        Internal function.

        Distribute criterions from DB into each of the phisical source
        lines.

        Parameters: (ARRAY) $self $structure_data $hits

        Returns: Hash

    make_branch_details
        Make detailed branch coverage report.

        Parameters: $self $basename $structure_data $hits

    make_subroutine_details
        Make detailed subroutine coverage report.

        Parameters: $self $basename $structure_data $hits

    make_condition_details
        Make detailed branch coverage report.

        Parameters: $self $basename $structure_data $hits

    make_summary_report
        Make file index, with coverage summary for each.

        Parameters: $self $total_summary - total (all files/runs average)
        summary

    compute_summary
        Utility routine, compute summary for each criterion.

        Source should be a hash - key for each criterion, holding arrays.
        Example:

            $source = {
                branch     => \@branch_line_hits,
                condition  => \@condition_line_hits,
                statement  => \@statement_line_hits,
                subroutine => \@subroutine_line_hits,
                pod        => \@pod_line_hits,
            }

        Params: $source

    c_class
        Compute proper c-class, used for color-coding coverage information:

         c0 : not covered or coverage < 50%
         c1 : coverage >= 50%
         c2 : coverage >= 75%
         c3 : coverage >= 90%
         c4 : covered or coverage = 100%

        Static function.

    namify_path
        If image is worth a thousand words, then example should cound as
        about 750... Turn something like this:
        /home/natanael/Perl/Foo/Bar/Baz.pm

        into this: -home-natanael-Perl-Foo-Bar-Baz-pm

        Additionally, remove any characters, that could confuse shell.
        Effectivelly, the resulting string should be safe for use in shell,
        web and by childrens under 3 years old :)

        Static function.
