.SH "NAME"
Dist::Zilla::Plugin::PkgVersion \- add a $VERSION to your packages
.SH "VERSION"
.IX Header "VERSION"
version 6.010
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.IX Header "SYNOPSIS"
in dist.ini
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  [PkgVersion]
.Ve
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
This plugin will add lines like the following to each package in each Perl
module or program (more or less) within the distribution:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  $MyModule::VERSION = \*(Aq0.001\*(Aq;
.Ve
.PP
or
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  { our $VERSION = \*(Aq0.001\*(Aq; }
.Ve
.PP
\&...where 0.001 is the version of the dist, and MyModule is the name of the
package being given a version.  (In other words, it always uses fully-qualified
names to assign versions.)
.PP
It will skip any package declaration that includes a newline between the
\&\f(CW\*(C`package\*(C'\fR keyword and the package name, like:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&  package
\&    Foo::Bar;
.Ve
.PP
This sort of declaration is also ignored by the \s-1CPAN\s0 toolchain, and is
typically used when doing monkey patching or other tricky things.
.SH "ATTRIBUTES"
.IX Header "ATTRIBUTES"
.SS "die_on_existing_version"
.IX Subsection "die_on_existing_version"
If true, then when PkgVersion sees an existing \f(CW$VERSION\fR assignment, it will
throw an exception rather than skip the file.  This attribute defaults to
false.
.SS "die_on_line_insertion"
.IX Subsection "die_on_line_insertion"
By default, PkgVersion looks for a blank line after each \f(CW\*(C`package\*(C'\fR statement.
If it finds one, it inserts the \f(CW$VERSION\fR assignment on that line.  If it
doesn't, it will insert a new line, which means the shipped copy of the module
will have different line numbers (off by one) than the source.  If
\&\f(CW\*(C`die_on_line_insertion\*(C'\fR is true, PkgVersion will raise an exception rather
than insert a new line.
.SS "use_package"
.IX Subsection "use_package"
This option, if true, will not insert an assignment to \f(CW$VERSION\fR but will
replace the existing \f(CW\*(C`package\*(C'\fR declaration with one that includes a version
like:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  package Module::Name 0.001;
.Ve
.SS "use_our"
.IX Subsection "use_our"
The idea here was to insert \f(CW\*(C`{ our $VERSION = \*(Aq0.001\*(Aq; }\*(C'\fR instead of \f(CW\*(C`$Module::Name::VERSION = \*(Aq0.001\*(Aq;\*(C'\fR.  It turns out that this causes problems
with some analyzers.  Use of this feature is deprecated.
.PP
Something else will replace it in the future.
.SS "use_begin"
.IX Subsection "use_begin"
If true, the version assignment is wrapped in a \s-1BEGIN\s0 block.  This may help in
rare cases, such as when DynaLoader has to be called at \s-1BEGIN\s0 time, and
requires \s-1VERSION. \s0 This option should be needed rarely.
.PP
Also note that assigning to \f(CW$VERSION\fR before the module has finished
compiling can lead to confused behavior with attempts to determine whether a
module was successfully loaded on perl v5.8.
.SS "finder"
.IX Subsection "finder"
This is the name of a FileFinder for finding
modules to edit.  The default value is \f(CW\*(C`:InstallModules\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`:ExecFiles\*(C'\fR;
this option can be used more than once.
.PP
Other predefined finders are listed in
\&\*(L"default_finders\*(R" in Dist::Zilla::Role::FileFinderUser.
You can define your own with the
[FileFinder::ByName] and
[FileFinder::Filter] plugins.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.IX Header "SEE ALSO"
Core Dist::Zilla plugins:
PodVersion,
AutoVersion,
NextRelease.
.PP
Other Dist::Zilla plugins:
OurPkgVersion inserts version
numbers using \f(CW\*(C`our $VERSION = \*(Aq...\*(Aq;\*(C'\fR and without changing line numbers
