SVN::Look - A caching wrapper around the svnlook command.

The svnlook command is the workhorse of Subversion hook scripts, being
used to gather all sorts of information about a repository, its
revisions, and its transactions. This module provides a simple object
oriented interface to a specific svnlook invocation, to make it easier
to hook writers to get and use the information they need.
