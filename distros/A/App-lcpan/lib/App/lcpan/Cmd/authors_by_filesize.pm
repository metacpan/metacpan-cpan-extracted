=head1 FUNCTIONS


=head2 handle_cmd

Usage:

 handle_cmd(%args) -> [status, msg, payload, meta]

List authors ranked by total size of their indexed releases.

This function is not exported.

Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

=over 4

=item * B<cpan> => I<dirname>

Location of your local CPAN mirror, e.g. /path/to/cpan.

Defaults to C<~/cpan>.

=item * B<index_name> => I<filename> (default: "index.db")

Filename of index.

If C<index_name> is a filename without any path, e.g. C<index.db> then index will
be located in the top-level of C<cpan>. If C<index_name> contains a path, e.g.
C<./index.db> or C</home/ujang/lcpan.db> then the index will be located solely
using the C<index_name>.

=item * B<use_bootstrap> => I<bool> (default: 1)

Whether to use bootstrap database from App-lcpan-Bootstrap.

If you are indexing your private CPAN-like repository, you want to turn this
off.
