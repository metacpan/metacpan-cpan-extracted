Revision history for Template-Provider-Amazon-S3
0.008    28 February 2012
         After running the last build on an s3 volume with a very large
         number of templates, the startup time was insane. This is becase,
         the system was downloading and populating every template into the
         fresh cache. So, I've opted for a lazier approach. I have, also,
         increased the size of my test s3 bucket with many more small 
         template files.

         Changed out the cache logic, I have replace the complicated 
         system of two CHI caches with one that just store the things
         of interest. I think I was starting of over-engineered the 
         caching.

         Changed out my naive cache logic, and replace it with Chi.
         Added two options
            * refresh_in_seconds
               This was added in the last release, but I updated the 
               doc this release.
            * cache_options
               This is passed to CHI->new(); The default is an in memory
               cache.
         Added better error handling around getting objects from S3. If
         and error is thrown, it will remove the item from the cache and
         try to retrieve it again.
