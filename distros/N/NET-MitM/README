NET-MitM v0.01_02

NET::MitM is designed to be inserted between a client and a server. It proxies all traffic through verbatum, and also copies that same data to a log file and/or a callback function, allowing a data session to be monitored, recorded and/or altered on the fly.

MitM acts as a 'man in the middle', sitting between the client and server.  To the client, MitM looks like the server.  To the server, MitM looks like the client.

When started, MitM opens a socket and listens for connections. When that socket is connected to, MitM opens another connection to the server.  Messages from either client or server are passed to the other, and a copy of each message is, potentially, logged.  Alternately, callback methods may be used to add business logic, including potentially altering the messages being passed.

MitM cannot be used to covertly MitM unsuspecting client/server sessions - it requires that you control either the client or the server.

MitM can also be used to allow two processes on machines that cannot 'see' each other to communicate via an intermediary machine that is visible to both.
