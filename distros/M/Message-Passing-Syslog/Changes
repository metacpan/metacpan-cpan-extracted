0.011
    - Add Socket dependency which is a core module but older versions lack
      getnameinfo (thanks CPAN Testers!)

0.010
    - Use Parse::Syslog::Line for parsing of syslog messages in Input::Syslog
    - Remove remote_hostname attribute in Input::Syslog because RFC5426 states
      in section 3.4:
      The source IP address of the UDP datagrams SHOULD NOT be interpreted
      as the identifier for the host that originated the syslog message.
      Instead the IPv4 or IPv6 address is always stored in the received_from
      field.

0.009
    - Change remote_hostname to return the remote IP address
      rather than doing a reverse DNS lookup per syslog packet
    - Add example of the Input::Syslog message format

0.008
    - Add remote_hostname attribute to Input::Syslog (abraxxa)

0.007

    - Add an output (perigrin)

0.006
    - Stop forcing AnyEvent model to POE.

0.005
    - Fix dependencies by requiring Time::ParseDate

0.004
    - Drop need for POE by implementing in plain AnyEvent
      (POE and AnyEvent aren't getting on nicely for me in a
      real environment)
    - Drop support for TCP syslog as I'm not using it / can't test
      it currently.

0.003
    - Change 'host' command line option to 'hostname' to fit in
      with other adaptors
