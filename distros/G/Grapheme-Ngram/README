NAME
    Grapheme::Ngram - n-grams of Unicode Extended Grapheme Clusters

SYNOPSIS
     use Grapheme::Ngram;

     my $class = 'Grapheme::Ngram';
     my @ngrams = $class->ngram($string,$width);

DESCRIPTION
    For many applications it's better to work along graphemes.

    Building n-grams is one of them.

METHODS
  new
      $object = Grapheme::Ngram->new();

  ngram
      my $array_ref = $object->ngram($string, $width);

    $string ...... string of characters

    $width ....... length of the resulting tokens. Default is 1.

    $array_ref ... reference to array of ngram tokens

    Returns one token with the unmodified $string if the number of graphemes
    in $string is lower than $width. Returns an empty $array_ref if $string
    is empty or undef. NOTE: maybe this will be changed in future. Defaults
    to length = 1 if $width is not an integer larger than 0.

  from_tokens
      my @ngram = $object->from_tokens(\@tokens, $width);

    Same as "ngram" but takes tokens. This method is used by "ngram".

    This allows to use a custom tokenizer for e.g. treating 'sh' also as
    grapheme:

      my @tokens = $string =~ m/(Sh|sh|\X)/g;

  _tokenize
      my @graphemes = $object->_tokenize($string);

    This internal method splits $string into a list of graphemes.
