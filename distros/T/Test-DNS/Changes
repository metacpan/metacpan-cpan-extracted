Revision history for Test-DNS

0.201     2019-03-03 15:03:41+02:00 Asia/Jerusalem
        - Removed Set::Object dependency. (Should fix tests.)

0.200     2019-03-02 23:41:37+02:00 Asia/Jerusalem
        - All attributes are now immutable. If you need to change
          anything (nameservers, the object, even the follow_cname
          flag), create a new instance. Sorry and thank you.
        - Only provide nameservers when they are specified.
          (Otherwise, it won't look in /etc/resolv.conf.)
        - Allow user to provide their own test names.
        - Test methods now provide a proper, hopefully meaningful
          return value.
        - Simplify code considerably, make much more readable.
        - Updating DNS records.
