NAME
    Math::PRBS - Generate Pseudorandom Binary Sequences using an
    Iterator-based Linear Feedback Shift Register

SYNOPSIS
        use Math::PRBS;
        my $x3x2  = Math::PRBS->new( taps => [3,2] );
        my $prbs7 = Math::PRBS->new( prbs => 7 );
        my ($i, $value) = $x3x2t->next();
        my @p7 = $prbs7->generate_all();

DESCRIPTION
    This module will generate various Pseudorandom Binary Sequences (PRBS).
    This module creates a iterator object, and you can use that object to
    generate the sequence one value at a time, or *en masse*.

    The generated sequence is a series of 0s and 1s which appears random for
    a certain length, and then repeats thereafter.

    It is implemented using an XOR-based Linear Feedback Shift Register
    (LFSR), which is described using a feedback polynomial (or reciprocal
    characteristic polynomial). The terms that appear in the polynomial are
    called the 'taps', because you tap off of that bit of the shift register
    for generating the feedback for the next value in the sequence.

FUNCTIONS AND METHODS
  Initialization
    "$seq = Math::PRBS::new( *key => value* )"
        Creates the sequence iterator $seq using one of the "key => value"
        pairs described below.

        "prbs => *n*"
            "prbs" needs an integer *n* to indicate one of the "standard"
            PRBS polynomials.

                # example: PRBS7 = x**7 + x**6 + 1
                $seq = Math::PRBS::new( ptbs => 7 );

            The "standard" PRBS polynomials implemented are

                polynomial        | prbs       | taps            | poly (string)
                ------------------+------------+-----------------+---------------
                x**7 + x**6 + 1   | prbs => 7  | taps => [7,6]   | poly => '1100000'
                x**15 + x**14 + 1 | prbs => 15 | taps => [15,14] | poly => '110000000000000'
                x**23 + x**18 + 1 | prbs => 23 | taps => [23,18] | poly => '10000100000000000000000'
                x**31 + x**28 + 1 | prbs => 31 | taps => [31,28] | poly => '1001000000000000000000000000000'

        "taps => [ *tap*, *tap*, ... ]"
            "taps" needs an array reference containing the powers in the
            polynomial that you tap off for creating the feedback. Do *not*
            include the 0 for the "x**0 = 1" in the polynomial; that's
            automatically included.

                # example: x**3 + x**2 + 1
                #   3 and 2 are taps, 1 is not tapped, 0 is implied feedback
                $seq = Math::PRBS::new( taps => [3,2] );

        "poly => '...'"
            "poly" needs a string for the bits "x**k" downto "x**1", with a
            1 indicating the power is included in the list, and a 0
            indicating it is not.

                # example: x**3 + x**2 + 1
                #   3 and 2 are taps, 1 is not tapped, 0 is implied feedback
                $seq = Math::PRBS::new( poly => '110' );

    "$seq->reset()"
        Reinitializes the sequence: resets the sequence back to the starting
        state. The next call to "next()" will be the initial "$i,$value"
        again.

  Iteration
    "$value = $seq->next()"
    "($i, $value) = $seq->next()"
        Computes the next value in the sequence. (Optionally, in list
        context, also returns the current value of the i for the sequence.)

    "$seq->rewind()"
        Rewinds the sequence back to the starting state. The subsequent call
        to "next()" will be the initial "$i,$value" again. (This is actually
        an alias for "reset()").

    "$i = $seq->tell_i()"
        Return the current "i" position. The subsequent call to "next()"
        will return this "i".

    "$state = $seq->tell_state()"
        Return the current internal state of the feedback register. Useful
        for debug, or plugging into "->seek_to_state($state)" to get back to
        this state at some future point in the program.

    "$seq->seek_to_i( $n )"
    "$seq->ith( $n )"
        Moves forward in the sequence until "i" reaches $n. If "i > $n"
        already, will internally "rewind()" first. If "$n > period", it will
        stop at the end of the period, instead.

    "$seq->seek_to_state( $lfsr )"
        Moves forward in the sequence until the internal LFSR state reaches
        $lfsr. It will wrap around, if necessary, but will stop once the
        internal state returns to the starting point.

    "$seq->seek_forward_n( $n )"
        Moves forward in the sequence $n steps.

    "$seq->seek_to_end()"
    "$seq->seek_to_end( limit => $n )"
        Moves forward until it's reached the end of the the period. (Will
        start in the first period using "tell_i % period".)

        If "limit =" $n> is used, will not seek beyond "tell_i == $n".

    "@all = $seq->generate( *n* )"
        Generates the next *n* values in the sequence, wrapping around if it
        reaches the end. In list context, returns the values as a list; in
        scalar context, returns the string concatenating that list.

    "@all = $seq->generate_all( )"
    "@all = $seq->generate_all( *limit => $max_i* )"
        Returns the whole sequence, from the beginning, up to the end of the
        sequence; in list context, returns the list of values; in scalar
        context, returns the string concatenating that list. If the sequence
        is longer than the default limit of 65535, or the limit given by
        $max_i if the optional "limit => $max_i" is provided, then it will
        stop before the end of the sequence.

    "@all = $seq->generate_to_end( )"
    "@all = $seq->generate_to_end( *limit => $max_i* )"
        Returns the remaining sequence, from whatever state the list is
        currently at, up to the end of the sequence; in list context,
        returns the list of values; in scalar context, returns the string
        concatenating that list. The limits work just as with
        "generate_all()".

  Information
    "$i = $seq->description"
        Returns a string describing the sequence in terms of the polynomial.

            $prbs7->description     # "PRBS from polynomial x**7 + x**6 + 1"

    "$i = $seq->taps"
        Returns an array-reference containing the list of tap identifiers,
        which could then be passed to "->new(taps => ...)".

            my $old_prbs = ...;
            my $new_prbs = Math::PRBS->new( taps => $old_prbs->taps() );

    "$i = $seq->period( *force => 'estimate' | $n | 'max'* )"
        Returns the period of the sequence.

        Without any arguments, will return undef if the period hasn't been
        determined yet (ie, haven't travelled far enough in the sequence):

            $i = $seq->period();                        # unknown => undef

        If *force* is set to 'estimate', will return "period = 2**k - 1" if
        the period hasn't been determined yet:

            $i = $seq->period(force => 'estimate');     # unknown => 2**k - 1

        If *force* is set to an integer $n, it will try to generate the
        whole sequence (up to "tell_i <= $n"), and return the period if
        found, or undef if not found.

            $i = $seq->period(force => $n);             # look until $n; undef if sequence period still not found

        If *force* is set 'max', it will loop thru the entire sequence (up
        to "i = 2**k - 1"), and return the period that was found. It will
        still return undef if still not found, but all sequences should find
        the period within "2**k-1". If you find a sequence that doesn't,
        feel free to file a bug report, including the "Math::PRBS->new()"
        command listing the taps array or poly string; if "k" is greater
        than 32, please include a code that fixes the bug in the bug report,
        as development resources may not allow for debug of issues when "k >
        32".

            $i = $seq->period(force => 'max');          # look until 2**k - 1; undef if sequence period still not found

    "$i = $seq->oeis_anum"
        For known polynomials, return the On-line Encyclopedia of Integer
        Sequences <https://oeis.org> "A" number. For example, you can go to
        <https://oeis.org/A011686> to look at the sequence A011686.

        Not all maximum-length PRBS sequences (binary m-sequences) are in
        OEIS. Of the four "standard" PRBS (7, 15, 23, 31) mentioned above,
        only PRBS7 is there, as A011686 <https://oeis.org/A011686>. If you
        have the A-number for other m-sequences that aren't included below,
        please let the module maintainer know.

THEORY
    A pseudorandom binary sequence (PRBS) is the sequence of N unique bits,
    in this case generated from an LFSR. Once it generates the N bits, it
    loops around and repeats that seqence. While still within the unique N
    bits, the sequence of N bits shares some properties with a truly random
    sequence of the same length. The benefit of this sequence is that, while
    it shares statistical properites with a random sequence, it is actually
    deterministic, so is often used to deterministically test hardware or
    software that requires a data stream that needs pseudorandom properties.

    In an LFSR, the polynomial description (like "x**3 + x**2 + 1")
    indicates which bits are "tapped" to create the feedback bit: the taps
    are the powers of x in the polynomial (3 and 2). The 1 is really the
    "x**0" term, and isn't a "tap", in the sense that it isn't used for
    generating the feedback; instead, that is the location where the new
    feedback bit comes back into the shift register; the 1 is in all
    characteristic polynomials, and is implied when creating a new instance
    of Math::PRBS.

    If the largest power of the polynomial is "k", there are "k+1" bits in
    the register (one for each of the powers "k..1" and one for the "x**0 =
    1"'s feedback bit). For any given "k", the largest sequence that can be
    produced is "N = 2^k - 1", and that sequence is called a maximum length
    sequence or m-sequence; there can be more than one m-sequence for a
    given "k". One useful feature of an m-sequence is that if you divide it
    into every possible partial sequence that's "k" bits long (wraping from
    N-1 to 0 to make the last few partial sequences also "k" bits), you will
    generate every possible combination of "k" bits (*), except for "k"
    zeroes in a row. For example,

        # x**3 + x**2 + 1 = "1011100"
        "_101_1100 " -> 101
        "1_011_100 " -> 011
        "10_111_00 " -> 111
        "101_110_0 " -> 110
        "1011_100_ " -> 100
        "1_0111_00 " -> 001 (requires wrap to get three digits: 00 from the end, and 1 from the beginning)
        "10_1110_0 " -> 010 (requires wrap to get three digits: 0 from the end, and 10 from the beginning)

    The Wikipedia:LFSR article (see "REFERENCES") lists some polynomials
    that create m-sequence for various register sizes, and links to Philip
    Koopman's complete list up to "k=64".

    If you want to create try own polynonial to find a long m-sequence, here
    are some things to consider: 1) the number of taps for the feedback
    (remembering not to count the feedback bit as a tap) must be even; 2)
    the entire set of taps must be relatively prime; 3) those two conditions
    are necesssary, but not sufficient, so you may have to try multiple
    polynomials to find an m-sequence; 4) keep in mind that the time to
    compute the period (and thus determine if it's an m-sequence) doubles
    every time "k" increases by 1; as the time increases, it makes more
    sense to look at the complete list up to "k=64"), and pure-perl is
    probably tpp wrong language for searching "k>64".

    (*) Since a maximum length sequence contains every k-bit combination
    (except all zeroes), it can be used for verifying that software or
    hardware behaves properly for every possible sequence of k-bits.
