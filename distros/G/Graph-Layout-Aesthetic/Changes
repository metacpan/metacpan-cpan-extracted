Revision history for Perl extension Graph::Layout::Aesthetic.

TODO:
	- tests for gloss.pl
        - Make the forces into subpackages
	- For gloss_graph maybe allow to get the number of dimensions
	  from a graph attribute, or from the pos/hold attribute size
	  if array references or the already existing coordinates if hold is
	  a string. Not sure if this is a good idea.
        - Add magic tests (does it work at all ? No unneeded extra accesses ?)
	- self-locking ? Thread support ?
	- generalize a way to efficiently put vertex attributes in a topology.
	- MD5 of files in Include.pm and compare with inline value.
	  If they differ, protest (author should then increase version and MD5)
	- add_force should probably also take forces instead of names as
	  argument.
	- If C-structures change, derived classes should notice and not load.

0.12  2005-11-30
	- added a #define packWARN for older perls that don't have it yet.

0.11  2005-07-31
	- Updated windows gnuplot tests to use the right terminal type

0.10  2005-07-28
	- Updated for the new interface of Graph 0.50

0.09  2005-07-28
	- The windows frontent to gnuplot is called "pgnuplot"
	- The default gnuplot terminaltype on windows is "windows", not "X11"
	- Don't try to pass a geometry argument to gnuplot on windows.
	- Start using PERL_NO_GET_CONTEXT, and properly propagate the
	  interpreter context everywhere.
	- Replaced :: by - in author email address (easier quoting for mailers)
	- Replace object access by more paranoid versions.
	- Updated Sample._xs to reflect current reality.
	- Added dummy MODULE lines in the .xs files that don't have it (or
	  really need it). Some versions of xsubpp seem to insist on this.
	- Minor documentation updates.

0.08  2004-11-08
        - There were variable declarations inside code.
        - Predeclare the boot_ calls.
	- remove aglo_point_iso_frame before anyone thinks that actually works.
	- Removed some unused variables
	- Rename the variable "rand" to something else. Some compilers dislike
	  the conflict with rand().
	- Call perl rand through the opcode table if the random generator is
          uninitialized (might need a fake pad if someone uses this from XSUB)
	- Remove inline, unportable. Use macros instead.
	- fmin() is unused. min() and max() are very popular macro names and
	  sometimes cause conflicts. Drop them.
	- Tests should not depend on fileseparator (\ versus /)
	- Don't use the OO interface to File::Temp, it's not yet in older
	  perls.
	- File::Temp tempfiles are seemingly opened in binmode. Do the tail
	  in textmode in t/05_GnuPlot.t.

0.07  2004-11-06
	- Make user_data and _private data into lvalue subs.
	- Added some get magic.
	- Simplified the gen_include makerule so hopefully nmake can now
          handle it.

0.06  2004-10-01
	- Forgot to document Graph::Layout::Aesthetic::Force::MinEdgeLength.
        - Forgot to update the NAME entry of the different forces.
	- Graph::Layout::Aesthetic::Force::Perl gradient was documented wrong.
	- Other minor docs updates.
	- Have "layout" as an alias for gloss_graph
          (not documented/tested yet)
	- Allow to drop the first argument (class) to gloss_graph/layout so
	  you can also use it as a function (not documented/tested yet).

0.05  2004-10-01
	- The gnuplot tests still failed for the solaris cpan tester, but at
          least it gets close now.

0.04  2004-09-30
        - Warn in case of a clear_forces during a gradient call.
	- The gnuplot tests still seem to fail for the solaris cpan tester,
          but I can't reproduce the problem on my solaris box.
          Stop using the IPC::Open3 hacks and try hacks involving ``

0.03  2004-09-29
	- gnuplot test failed if user doesn't have gnuplot.
        - Fix potential coredump when destroying forces during a gradient call
          (and added a test for it)
        - Document that the aglo and topology object are not threadsafe.

0.02  2004-09-29
	- Changed the default attributes to have a layout_ prefix to be
	  more compatible with Graph::Layouter
	- set frame coordinates as attributes on a graph if requested
	- Mention Graph::Layouter and Graph::Renderer in the docs
	- Added a $VERSION to a few forgotten modules

0.01  2004-09-29
        - Lots of programming and testing.
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.23 with options
		-A -n Graph::Layout::Aesthetic
