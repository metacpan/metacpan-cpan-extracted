Changes for Perl extension TinyAuth

0.98 Sat 01 Dec 2007
	- Hard-to-detect errors occur when the "use TinyAuth" call
	  loads the system version incorrectly, instead of the local
	  version. So we will get rid of the .pm file completely.
	  The Makefile.PL now generates script/tinyauth from two
	  separate source tinyauth.pl and TinyAuth.pm files.

	- The promote and delete functions were being triggered from a GET request
