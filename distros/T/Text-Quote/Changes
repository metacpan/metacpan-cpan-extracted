    - Fixed bug where quote_best and _textquote_escape had different
      ideas of what needed escaping.  Added option 'encode_high' to determine
      if high bit chars needed escaping or if they can be left as literals
    - Fixed minor bug in quote_best where it was using the last lowest instead
      of the first lowest used quote char.
