=head1 NAME

diff-pdf-text - Diff the text of two PDF documents

=head1 VERSION

This document describes version 0.002 of diff-pdf-text (from Perl distribution App-DiffPDFText), released on 2021-07-17.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Use like you would use the Unix command B<diff>:

 % diff-pdf-text [options] <FILE>...

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a wrapper for the Unix command B<diff>. It assumes that each input file
is a PDF file and tries to convert the file to text first using L<App::PDFUtils>
(which in turn uses B<pdftotext> CLI utility). It then passes the converted
text C<< diff -ruN >> command.

=head1 DIFF_CMD

String. Can be used to set path to diff command. See also
L</DIFF_PDF_TEXT_DIFF_CMD> which takes precedence.

=head2 DIFF_PDF_TEXT_DIFF_CMD

String. Can be used to set path to diff command. The defaultl is L<diffwc> if
available in PATH, or C<diff>. Takes precedence over L</DIFF_CMD>.

=head1 OPTIONS

These are options that are interpreted by B<diff-pdf-text> and not passed to
B<diff>.

B<Please specify these options before file names.>

=over

=item * --pdf-pages

Only diff a range of pages instead of the whole PDF. Example: 1,5-10,15.
Requires B<pdftk> to extract the page range.

=back

=head1 ENVIRONMENT

=head2 DEBUG

If set to true, do not cleanup temporary directories.
