NAME
    MooseX::XSConstructor - glue between Moose and Class::XSConstructor

SYNOPSIS
      package Foo;
  
      use Moose;
      use MooseX::XSConstructor;
  
      ...; # Normal Moose stuff
  
      __PACKAGE__->meta->make_immutable(
        inline_constructor => 0,
        inline_destructor  => 0,
      );

DESCRIPTION
    This module speeds up all your Mooses. (Meese?)

    It does this by replacing the normal Perl constructor that Moose generates
    for your class with a faster one written in XS.

    If it detects that your class cannot be accellerated, then it will bail
    out and do nothing.

    Most built-in Moose features are supported though, as are a few
    extensions. Namely: MooseX::Aliases, MooseX::StrictConstructor, and
    MooseX::UndefTolerant. If you're using other MooseX modules, you probably
    won't get a speedup.
