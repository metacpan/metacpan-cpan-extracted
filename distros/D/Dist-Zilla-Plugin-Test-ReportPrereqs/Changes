0.020     2015-01-27 09:59:52-05:00 America/New_York

  - drop the Want column from the "Other Modules" section

0.019     2014-08-13 12:20:18-04:00 America/New_York

  [Changed]

  - Modules included in the dist.ini file are now put in their own report
    section "Other Modules" instead of being merged into Runtime Requires.

0.018     2014-08-01 12:22:01-04:00 America/New_York

  [Changed]

  - Removes List::Util and Scalar::Util as runtime dependencies for better
    backward compatibility; also fixes an unintialized value warning in
    the generated test file when CPAN::Meta isn't installed

  - Removes Path::Class and Cwd as a test dependencies

  - Adds CPAN::Meta as a test dependency (which shouldn't really matter
    since Dist::Zilla has it as a dependency anyway)

0.017     2014-07-30 16:48:36-04:00 America/New_York

  [Changed]

  - generated test file uses File::Spec instead of File::Spec::Functions

0.016     2014-07-29 14:07:49-04:00 America/New_York

  [Fixed]

  - Fixed how the version regular expression is used (whoops!)

0.015     2014-07-29 13:28:06-04:00 America/New_York

  [Changed]

  - removes dependency on version.pm and uses its regular expression
    instead.

  [Fixed]

  - generated test file no longer fatal if verifying prereqs without
    CPAN::Meta installed.

0.014     2014-07-17 18:09:03-04:00 America/New_York

  [Changed]

  - Test file generation split in two.  The test file is gathered early and
    is available for analysis/munging by other plugins.  The static
    dependency data is saved into another file late (after prereqs are
    finalized).  The test file loads the static data at runtime.  This
    should make this plugin validate with [VerifyPhases].

  - Test report format now splits out report by phase and type.  This means
    that "Test Requires" are distinct from "Runtime Requires" and if there
    are different versions required for each phase, those are visible in
    the report.

0.013     2014-01-24 11:42:12-05:00 America/New_York

  [Changed]

  - Embeds the complete static prerequisite hash into the
    generated file; no longer creates just a static list
    (that varied based on AUTHOR_TESTING);

0.012     2014-01-14 15:49:18-05:00 America/New_York

  [Changed]

  - Modifies the test file with the static prerequisite list
    in memory during the InstallTool phase rather only on disk in
    the AfterBuild phase (Kent Fredric)

0.011     2014-01-07 11:46:22 America/New_York

  [Fixed]

  - now also verifying develop prereqs, when AUTHOR_TESTING is set
    (Karen Etheridge)

0.010     2013-10-16 17:02:34 America/New_York

  [Fixed]

  - fixed handling of modules with no $VERSION

0.009     2013-10-15 19:48:32 America/New_York

  [Changed]

  - now injecting test-recommends prereqs to enable prereq verification
    (Karen Etheridge)

0.008     2013-10-13 15:33:03 America/New_York

  [Fixed]

  - dropped use of newer CPAN::Meta::Requirement method so
    we're more backwards compatible

0.007     2013-10-12 13:50:23 America/New_York

  [Fixed]

  - 'exclude' option now respected when MYMETA.json is present

  [Changed]

  - now (optionally) reporting on any missing prereqs after listing all module
    versions [Karen Etheridge]
  - develop prereqs are now also reported/checked when AUTHOR_TESTING

0.006     2013-02-12 17:48:57 America/New_York

  [Fixed]

  - Don't report on 'develop' prereqs

0.005     2013-02-11 12:26:51 America/New_York

  [Changed]

  - Always reports, regardless of AUTOMATED_TESTING; this way even
    manual bug reports will give us the information we want

0.004     2012-05-16 11:33:16 America/New_York

  [Added]

  - New 'include' and 'exclude' attributes may be used to add additional
    modules or to remove modules from the report list [Randy Stauner]

0.003     2012-05-14 15:23:08 America/New_York

  [Fixed]

  - Optional CPAN::Meta requirement of generated test file is now
    obscured to hide it from prerequisite scanners.

  - Static requirements are merged with dynamic ones to ensure the
    most complete report possible on modules of interest

0.002     2012-05-14 15:11:36 America/New_York

  [Changed]

  - Fixed formatting in generated test file

0.001     2012-05-14 14:51:15 America/New_York
