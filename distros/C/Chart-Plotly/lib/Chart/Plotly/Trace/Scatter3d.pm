# ABSTRACT: The data visualized as scatter point or lines in 3D dimension is set in `x`, `y`, `z`. Text (appearing either on the chart or on hover only) is via `text`. Bubble charts are achieved by setting `marker.size` and/or `marker.color` Projections are achieved via `projection`. Surface fills are achieved via `surfaceaxis`.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 TO_JSON

Serialize the trace to JSON. This method should be called only by L<JSON> serializer.

=head2 type

Trace type.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=over

=item * connectgaps

Determines whether or not gaps (i.e. {nan} or missing values) in the provided data arrays are connected.

=item * customdata

Assigns extra data each datum. This may be useful when listening to hover, click and selection events. Note that, *scatter* traces also appends customdata items in the markers DOM elements

=item * customdatasrc

Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  customdata .

=item * error_x

=item * error_y

=item * error_z

=item * hoverinfo

Determines which trace information appear on hover. If `none` or `skip` are set, no information is displayed upon hovering. But, if `none` is set, click and hover events are still fired.

=item * hoverinfosrc

Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  hoverinfo .

=item * hoverlabel

=item * hovertemplate

Template string used for rendering the information that appear on hover box. Note that this will override `hoverinfo`. Variables are inserted using %{variable}, for example "y: %{y}". Numbers are formatted using d3-format's syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for example "Price: %{y:$.2f}". See https://github.com/d3/d3-format/blob/master/README.md#locale_format for details on the formatting syntax. The variables available in `hovertemplate` are the ones emitted as event data described at this link https://plot.ly/javascript/plotlyjs-events/#event-data. Additionally, every attributes that can be specified per-point (the ones that are `arrayOk: true`) are available.  Anything contained in tag `<extra>` is displayed in the secondary box, for example "<extra>{fullData.name}</extra>". To hide the secondary box completely, use an empty tag `<extra></extra>`.

=item * hovertemplatesrc

Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  hovertemplate .

=item * hovertext

Sets text elements associated with each (x,y,z) triplet. If a single string, the same string appears over all the data points. If an array of string, the items are mapped in order to the this trace's (x,y,z) coordinates. To be seen, trace `hoverinfo` must contain a *text* flag.

=item * hovertextsrc

Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  hovertext .

=item * ids

Assigns id labels to each datum. These ids for object constancy of data points during animation. Should be an array of strings, not numbers or any other type.

=item * idssrc

Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  ids .

=item * legendgroup

Sets the legend group for this trace. Traces part of the same legend group hide/show at the same time when toggling legend items.

=item * line

=item * marker

=item * pmeta

Assigns extra meta information associated with this trace that can be used in various text attributes. Attributes such as trace `name`, graph, axis and colorbar `title.text`, annotation `text` `rangeselector`, `updatemenues` and `sliders` `label` text all support `meta`. To access the trace `meta` values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use `%{meta[i]}` where `i` is the index or key of the `meta` item in question. To access trace `meta` in layout attributes, use `%{data[n[.meta[i]}` where `i` is the index or key of the `meta` and `n` is the trace index.

=item * metasrc

Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  meta .

=item * mode

Determines the drawing mode for this scatter trace. If the provided `mode` includes *text* then the `text` elements appear at the coordinates. Otherwise, the `text` elements appear on hover. If there are less than 20 points and the trace is not stacked then the default is *lines+markers*. Otherwise, *lines*.

=item * name

Sets the trace name. The trace name appear as the legend item and on hover.

=item * opacity

Sets the opacity of the trace.

=item * projection

=item * scene

Sets a reference between this trace's 3D coordinate system and a 3D scene. If *scene* (the default value), the (x,y,z) coordinates refer to `layout.scene`. If *scene2*, the (x,y,z) coordinates refer to `layout.scene2`, and so on.

=item * showlegend

Determines whether or not an item corresponding to this trace is shown in the legend.

=item * stream

=item * surfaceaxis

If *-1*, the scatter points are not fill with a surface If *0*, *1*, *2*, the scatter points are filled with a Delaunay surface about the x, y, z respectively.

=item * surfacecolor

Sets the surface fill color.

=item * text

Sets text elements associated with each (x,y,z) triplet. If a single string, the same string appears over all the data points. If an array of string, the items are mapped in order to the this trace's (x,y,z) coordinates. If trace `hoverinfo` contains a *text* flag and *hovertext* is not set, these elements will be seen in the hover labels.

=item * textfont

=item * textposition

Sets the positions of the `text` elements with respects to the (x,y) coordinates.

=item * textpositionsrc

Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  textposition .

=item * textsrc

Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  text .

=item * transforms

=item * uid

Assign an id to this trace, Use this to provide object constancy between traces during animations and transitions.

=item * uirevision

Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name` and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`. Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`, `selectedpoints` is controlled by `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)` (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove traces before the end of the `data` array, such that the same trace has a different index, you can still preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a `uid` that stays with it as it moves.

=item * visible

Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If *legendonly*, the trace is not drawn, but can appear as a legend item (provided that the legend itself is visible).

=item * x

Sets the x coordinates.

=item * xcalendar

Sets the calendar system to use with `x` date data.

=item * xsrc

Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  x .

=item * y

Sets the y coordinates.

=item * ycalendar

Sets the calendar system to use with `y` date data.

=item * ysrc

Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  y .

=item * z

Sets the z coordinates.

=item * zcalendar

Sets the calendar system to use with `z` date data.

=item * zsrc

Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  z .
