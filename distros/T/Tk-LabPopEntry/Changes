Revision history for Perl extension Tk-LabPopEntry-0.04

0.01  Initial release. 

0.02  Methods 'addItem' and 'deleteItem' added.

0.03  Bindings removed from 'Control' and 'Alt' keys to
      prevent conflict with 'Key' binding.
     
      'Sel. All' now disabled if entire contents of Entry
      widget are already selected.

0.04  The 'spaces allowed' issued was resolved with regards to -pattern.
      Regular expression for 'float' pattern works.
      Turned all "Control" strings on the menu into "Ctrl" so that the
      pop down menu would align properly in all window managers.
      Binds now work better, though the window manager can still take
      control for various sequences with unpredictable results.
      Toplevel control made better with judicious use of 'ismapped()'.
      Pod fixed (hopefully) and updated.
