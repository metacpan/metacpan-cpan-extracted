NAME

    relative - Load modules with relative names


DESCRIPTION

    This module allows you to load modules using only parts of their name,
    relatively to the current module or to a given module. Module names are
    by default searched below the current module, but can be searched upper
    in the hierarchy using the "..::" syntax.

    In order to further loosen the namespace coupling, "import" returns the
    full names of the loaded modules, making object-oriented code easier to
    write.

        perl Makefile.PL
