NAME

    Net::Async::Tangence - use Tangence with IO::Async

DESCRIPTION

    This distribution provides concrete implementations of the Tangence
    base classes, allowing either servers or clients to be written based on
    IO::Async.

    To implement a server, see Net::Async::Tangence::Server.

    To implement a client, see Net::Async::Tangence::Client.

    This module itself does not provide any code, and exists only to
    provide the module $VERSION and top-level documentation.
