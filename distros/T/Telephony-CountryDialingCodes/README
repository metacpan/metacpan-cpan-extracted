Telephony::CountryDialingCodes
==============================

Description
-----------
This class exports a method for determining a country's international dialing
access code, and another method for doing the reverse: i.e. determining the
country code(s) that belong(s) to a given international dialing access code.

You can call these methods in both class and object context. The difference is
that if you call them in object context that the internal lookup tables are
destroyed along with the object itself when it is destroyed, otherwise if you
call these methods in class context, then the internal lookup tables become
globals and will persist for the lifespan of the executing process. It's not
really a big deal which approach you choose, so for the sake of style, use the
object context approach if you have no clue which is better.
