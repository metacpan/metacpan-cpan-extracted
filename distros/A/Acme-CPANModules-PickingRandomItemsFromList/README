NAME
    Acme::CPANModules::PickingRandomItemsFromList - List of modules to pick
    random items from a list

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.006 of
    Acme::CPANModules::PickingRandomItemsFromList (from Perl distribution
    Acme-CPANModules-PickingRandomItemsFromList), released on 2025-05-22.

DESCRIPTION
    If you are picking random lines from a file, there's a separate
    CPANModules list for it: Acme::CPANModules::PickingRandomLinesFromFile.

    1. Picking a single item, with equal probability

    If you only want to pick a single item, with equal probability, you can
    simply get a random element from an array using the $ary[rand @ary]
    idiom.

    2. Picking multiple items, with equal probability

    2a. Picking multiple items, with equal probability, duplicates allowed

    If you want to allow duplicates, you can repeatedly pick random elements
    from an array using the $ary[rand @ary] idiom.

    2b. Picking multiple items, with equal probability, duplicates not
    allowed

    If you do not want to allow duplicates, there are several alternatives:

    List::Util (from version 1.54, 2020-02-02) provides sample(). If you use
    an older version, you can use shuffle() then get as many number of
    samples as you need from the first elements of the array using slice
    (@shuffled[0..$num_wanted-1]) or head().

    List::MoreUtils also provides samples().

    Keywords: sample, sampling.

    3. Picking item(s), with weights

    If you want to assign different weights to different items (so one item
    might be picked more likely), you can use one of these modules:

    Array::Sample::WeightedRandom offers sampling without replacement (not
    allowing duplicates) or with replacement (allowing duplicates).

    Random::Skew.

    Data::Random::Weighted currently can only pick a single item.

    Tangentially-related modules

    App::PickArgs provides CLI pick-args to pick random items from
    command-line arguments.

FAQ
  What is an Acme::CPANModules::* module?
    An Acme::CPANModules::* module, like this module, contains just a list
    of module names that share a common characteristics. It is a way to
    categorize modules and document CPAN. See Acme::CPANModules for more
    details.

  What are ways to use this Acme::CPANModules module?
    Aside from reading this Acme::CPANModules module's POD documentation,
    you can install all the listed modules (entries) using cpanm-cpanmodules
    script (from App::cpanm::cpanmodules distribution):

     % cpanm-cpanmodules -n PickingRandomItemsFromList

    Alternatively you can use the cpanmodules CLI (from App::cpanmodules
    distribution):

        % cpanmodules ls-entries PickingRandomItemsFromList | cpanm -n

    or Acme::CM::Get:

        % perl -MAcme::CM::Get=PickingRandomItemsFromList -E'say $_->{module} for @{ $LIST->{entries} }' | cpanm -n

    or directly:

        % perl -MAcme::CPANModules::PickingRandomItemsFromList -E'say $_->{module} for @{ $Acme::CPANModules::PickingRandomItemsFromList::LIST->{entries} }' | cpanm -n

    This Acme::CPANModules module also helps lcpan produce a more meaningful
    result for "lcpan related-mods" command when it comes to finding related
    modules for the modules listed in this Acme::CPANModules module. See
    App::lcpan::Cmd::related_mods for more details on how "related modules"
    are found.

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR,
    Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps
    required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
