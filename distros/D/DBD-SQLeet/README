NAME
  DBD::SQLeet - Encryption-capable SQLite3 DBI driver

SYNOPSIS
    use DBI;
    my $dbh = DBI->connect("dbi:SQLeet:dbname=$dbfile","","");
    $dbh->do("PRAGMA key = 'password';");

DESCRIPTION
  DBD::SQLeet is a combination of the DBD::SQLite CPAN module and
  sqleet - public domain encryption extension for SQLite3:
  <https://github.com/resilar/sqleet>

  DBD::SQLeet Perl code and test suite
  are entirely based on the DBD::SQLite v.1.58 CPAN module.

  The DBD::SQLeet API is a copy of the DBD::SQLite v.1.58 API.
  See <https://metacpan.org/pod/DBD::SQLite> for reference.

SQLITE VERSION
  DBD::SQLeet is compiled with a bundled sqleet library:
  sqleet version 0.24.0 as of this release.

  DBD::SQLeet follows the sqleet versioning scheme.
  <https://github.com/resilar/sqleet#versioning-scheme>

  Version 0.24.0 of sqleet is based on SQLite v3.24.0

DIFFERENCES FROM DBD::SQLite
  URI filename syntax
    DBD::SQLeet may not open successfully a database using the following code:

      my $dbh = DBI->connect("dbi:SQLite:file:$dbfile","","");

    SQLite3 support for opening an URI filename is otherwise not impaired.
    You can use:

      my $dbh = DBI->connect("dbi:SQLite:uri=file:$dbfile","","");

  No DBD::SQLeet::VirtualTable classes
    DBD::SQLeet has no classes similar to
    DBD::SQLite::VirtualTable::FileContent and DBD::SQLite::VirtualTable::PerlData.
