0.017 2024-09-16T12:15:00Z

    - Support new opcodes introduced in 5.37 development cycle: PADSV_STORE
      and AELEMFASTLEX_STORE (#52)
    - Return build system to ExtUtils::MakeMaker (#54)

0.016 2024-09-16T11:30:00Z

    - [CPAN indexing failure]

0.015 2021-04-20T13:52:33Z

    - Support use of lexical subroutines (#41)
    - Account for subroutines stored directly in the stash in 5.27.6+. Fixed
      by sprout. (#34).

    - Fixed a bug where false positives were reported for some code constructs
      where a variable was used on the right side of an lvalue-expression. For
      example:

          sub foo {
              my @foo = qw( foo bar );
              my $last = $foo[-1];
              return $last;
          }

      In this case the "@foo" variable would be reported as unused.

    - Worked around a very weird bug with B's handling of multideref aux_list
      values on 5.22 and 5.24. This could cause a warning like "Use of
      uninitialized value $i in array element at
      /home/autarch/projects/p5-Test-Vars/lib/Test/Vars.pm line ..." when
      testing certain Perl constructs for unused vars. This appears to be
      fixed in blead's B.

    - On Perl 5.22+, variables used in a substitution operator ($foo =~
      s/foo/bar/) would be ignored. Reported by Greg Oschwald. (#28)

0.011 2016-10-16T19:54:15Z
    - Fixed tests to pass on Windows. Patch by Michael Schwern. (#26 and #27)

0.010 2016-07-01T03:13:42Z
    - Fix for pp_match in Perl 5.22+ (#23)

0.009 2016-05-21T16:41:58Z
    - On recent Perls (5.22 and 5.24, maybe more) this module could detect an
      unused variable named "$". This was a bogus false positive, as opposed
      to just a missing variable name in the output. Reported by Alexander
      Hartmaier. GitHub #22.
    - Fixed tests to use File::Spec->catfile to generate paths so that tests
      pass on Windows. Reported by Paul Durden. Based on GitHub PR #20.

0.008 2015-08-19T21:08:28Z
    - In some corner cases, Test::Vars would try to look inside the body of a
      stub sub ("sub foo;") and then blow up. This could be triggered by
      declaring a stub sub and then an attribute with a reader of the same
      name in a Moose::Role, for example. Reported by Andy Jack.

0.007 2015-08-19T15:54:27Z
    - Fix tests with threaded Perl 5.22+. Reported by Paul Howarth.

0.006 2015-08-19T02:23:16Z
    - This module now calls Test::Builder->diag and ->note _after_ calling
      ->ok. This is more in line with how most test modules work. Patch by Ran
      Eilam.
    - Added a new exported sub, test_vars(), which does not output TAP. This
      is useful for integrating this module with things like
      Code::TidyAll. Patch by Dave Rolsky.

0.005 2013-05-31T02:04:42Z
    - Use skip_all instead of planning 0 tests (#4)
