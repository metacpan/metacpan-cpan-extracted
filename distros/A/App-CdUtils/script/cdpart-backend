=head1 NAME

cdpart-backend - Change directory part

=head1 VERSION

This document describes version 0.012 of cdpart-backend (from Perl distribution App-CdUtils), released on 2025-11-04.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

To use in shell:

 % cdpart() { cd `cdpart-backend "$1"`; }

 % cd /media/mv/en/c/celine-dion
 % cdpart fr; # /media/mv/fr/c/celine-dion

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<cdpart> is a command to change directory which can be convenient in some
cases. It takes your argument and tries to substitute your argument into the
directory path element starting from the deepest to the topmost, stopping after
it finds an existing directory, then change to the directory.

The best way to explain it is by an example. Consider this directory structure:

 media/
   mv/
     en/
       a/
       b/
       c/
         carly-rae-japsen/
         celine-dion/
         charlie-puth/
         ...
       ...
     fr/
       a/
       b/
       c/
         celine-dion/
         christophe-willem/
         ...
     de/
     ...
   music/
     en/
       a/
       b/
       c/
         celine-dion/
         ...
     fr/
       a/
       b/
       c/
         celine-dion/
         ...
       ...
     ...
  ...

You can see that the directories C<mv> and C<music> have the same structure: the
first subdirectory level is language code (C<en>, C<fr>, ...), the second level
is the first letter of artist's name (C<a>, C<b>, C<c>, ...) and the third level
is the name of the artist.

Suppose you are now in directory:

 /media/mv/en/c/celine-dion

and you want to see Céline's French music videos (in
C</media/mv/fr/c/celine-dion>). If you use B<cd>, the command will be:

 % cd ../../fr/c/celine-dion

which is too much to type because you are retyping the substructure. With
B<cdpart> you just have to type:

 % cdpart fr

What B<cdpart> will do is try the following directories in order:

 /media/mv/en/c/fr
 /media/mv/en/fr/celine-dion
 /media/mv/fr/c/celine-dion

The third succeeds so it goes there. If no match is found until the topmost
directory, B<cdpart> will try these in order:

 /media/mv/en/fr
 /media/mv/fr/c
 /media/fr/en/c
 /fr/mv/en/c

 /media/mv/fr
 /media/fr/en
 /fr/mv/en

 /media/fr
 /fr/mv

 /fr

If the last doesn't succeed too, B<cdpart> won't change directory.

Another example:

 % cdpart music

will eventually change the directory to C</media/music/fr/c/celine-dion>.

=head1 COMPLETION

This script has shell tab completion capability with support for several
shells.

=head2 bash

To activate bash completion for this script, put:

 complete -C cdpart-backend cdpart-backend

in your bash startup (e.g. C<~/.bashrc>). Your next shell session will then
recognize tab completion for the command. Or, you can also directly execute the
line above in your shell to activate immediately.

It is recommended, however, that you install modules using L<cpanm-shcompgen>
which can activate shell completion for scripts immediately.

=head2 tcsh

To activate tcsh completion for this script, put:

 complete cdpart-backend 'p/*/`cdpart-backend`/'

in your tcsh startup (e.g. C<~/.tcshrc>). Your next shell session will then
recognize tab completion for the command. Or, you can also directly execute the
line above in your shell to activate immediately.

It is also recommended to install C<shcompgen> (see above).

=head2 other shells

For fish and zsh, install C<shcompgen> as described above.

=head1 ENVIRONMENT

=head2 DEBUG

Bool. If set to true, will print the directories as they are tried.

=head2 CDPART_COMPLETE_ARRAY_ELEM_PER_LEVEL

Uint.

=head1 CONTRIBUTING


To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull requests on
GitHub.

Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You can
simply modify the code, then test via:

 % prove -l

If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally on your
system), you can install L<Dist::Zilla>,
L<Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR>,
L<Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR>, and sometimes one or two other
Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps required beyond
that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.

Please report any bugs or feature requests on the bugtracker website L<https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Dist/Display.html?Name=App-CdUtils>

When submitting a bug or request, please include a test-file or a
