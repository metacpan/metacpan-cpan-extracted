Tie/FileHandle/Buffer version 0.11
==================================

This module, when tied to a filehandle, will capture and store all that
is output to that handle.  You may then act on that stored information in
one of the following ways.

 my $contents = (tied *HANDLE)->get_contents; # retrieves the stored output

 (tied *HANDLE)->clear; # clears the output buffer

This module goes hand in hand with the Output::Buffer module.
