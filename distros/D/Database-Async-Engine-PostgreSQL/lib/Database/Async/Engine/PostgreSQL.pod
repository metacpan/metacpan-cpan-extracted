=head1 NAME

Database::Async::Engine::PostgreSQL - support for PostgreSQL databases in L<Database::Async>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

=head1 METHODS

=head2 connection

Returns a L<Future> representing the database connection,
and will attempt to connect if we are not already connected.

=head2 ssl

Whether to try SSL or not, expected to be one of the following
values from L<Protocol::Database::PostgreSQL::Constants>:

=over 4

=item * C<SSL_REQUIRE>

=item * C<SSL_PREFER>

=item * C<SSL_DISABLE>

=back

=head2 read_len

Buffer read length. Higher values mean we will attempt to read more
data for each I/O loop iteration.

Defaults to 2 megabytes.

=head2 write_len

Buffer write length. Higher values mean we will attempt to write more
data for each I/O loop iteration.

Defaults to 2 megabytes.

=head2 connect

Establish a connection to the server.

Returns a L<Future> which resolves to the L<IO::Async::Stream>
once ready.

=head2 negotiate_ssl

Apply SSL negotiation.

=head2 uri_for_dsn

Returns a L<URI> corresponding to the given L<database source name|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_source_name>.

May throw an exception if we don't have a valid string.

=head2 stream

The L<IO::Async::Stream> representing the database connection.

=head2 on_read

Process incoming database packets.

Expects the following parameters:

=over 4

=item * C<$stream> - the L<IO::Async::Stream> we are receiving data on

=item * C<$buffref> - a scalar reference to the current input data buffer

=item * C<$eof> - true if we have reached the end of input

=back

=head2 ryu

Provides a L<Ryu::Async> instance.

=head2 outgoing

L<Ryu::Source> representing outgoing packets for the current database connection.

=head2 incoming

L<Ryu::Source> representing incoming packets for the current database connection.

=head2 authenticated

Resolves once database authentication is complete.

=head2 protocol

Returns the L<Protocol::Database::PostgreSQL> instance, creating it
and setting up event handlers if necessary.

=head2 set_parameter

Marks a parameter update from the server.

=head2 idle

Resolves when we are idle and ready to process the next request.

=head1 Implementation notes

Query sequence is essentially:

=over 4

=item * receive C<ReadyForQuery>

=item * send C<frontend_query>

=item * Row Description

=item * Data Row

=item * Command Complete

=item * ReadyForQuery

=back

The DB creates an engine.  The engine does whatever connection handling required, and eventually should reach a "ready" state.
Once this happens, it'll notify DB to say "this engine is ready for queries".
If there are any pending queries, the next in the queue is immediately assigned
to this engine.
Otherwise, the engine is pushed into the pool of available engines, awaiting
query requests.

On startup, the pool `min` count of engine instances will be instantiated.
They start in the pending state.

Any of the following:

=over 4

=item * tx

=item * query

=item * copy etc.

=back

is treated as "queue request". It indicates that we're going to send one or
more commands over a connection.

L</next_engine> resolves with an engine instance:

=over 4

=item * check for engines in `available` queue - these are connected and waiting, and can be assigned immediately

=item * next look for engines in `unconnected` - these are instantiated but need
a ->connection first

=back
