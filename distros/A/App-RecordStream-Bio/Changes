    - Comprehensive tests for fromfasta and tofasta

0.08  2014-05-27 15:48:45 PDT
    - recs-fromfasta: Strip leading/trailing spaces from sequence names

0.07  2014-05-01 17:12:33 PDT
    - Bug fix: recs-fromfasta with --filename-key produced incorrect results
      for the last sequence in a file when using multiple input files.

0.06  2014-04-08 18:06:48 PDT
    - Add a --passthru option to recs-tofasta to skip nucleotide formatting

    - Added example of recs-tofasta to primary dist doc

0.02  2014-03-28 10:55:29 PDT
    - BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: recs-fromfasta now splits the sequence
      name into id and description on the first space.  If you were previously
      using the "id" key, you'll want to start using the "name" key.  I doubt
      anyone is using this but me, though. :)

    - Added recs-tofasta for a quick way to get fasta back out after munging,
      filtering, etc.

0.01  2014-03-25 17:53:25 PDT
    - Initial release
