NAME
    Net::SNMP::Mixin - mixin framework for Net::SNMP

VERSION
    Version 0.14

ABSTRACT
    Thin framework to access cooked SNMP information from SNMP agents with
    various mixins to Net::SNMP.

SYNOPSIS
      use Net::SNMP;
      use Net::SNMP::Mixin;

      my $session = Net::SNMP->session( -hostname => 'example.com' );
  
      # method mixin and initialization
      $session->mixer(qw/Net::SNMP::Mixin::Foo Net::SNMP::Mixin::Bar/);
      $session->init_mixins();
  
      # event_loop in case of nonblocking sessions
      snmp_dispatcher();

      # check for initialization errors
      $session->init_ok();

      die scalar $session->errors if $session->errors;

      # use mixed-in methods to retrieve cooked SNMP info
      my $a = $session->get_foo_a();
      my $b = $session->get_bar_b();

DESCRIPTION
    Net::SNMP implements already the methods to retrieve raw SNMP values
    from the agents. With the help of specialized mixins, the access to
    these raw SNMP values is simplified and necessary calculations on these
    values are already done for gaining high level information.

    This module provides helper functions in order to mixin methods into the
    inheritance tree of the Net::SNMP session instances or the Net::SNMP
    class itself.

    The standard Net::SNMP get_... methods are still supported and the
    mixins fetch itself the needed SNMP values during initialization with
    these standard get_... methods. Blocking and non blocking sessions are
    supported. The mixins don't change the Net::SNMP session instance,
    besides storing additional payload in the object space prefixed with the
    unique mixin module names as the hash key.

DEFAULT EXPORTS
    These methods are exported by default into the Net::SNMP namespace:

    *   mixer

    *   init_mixins

    *   init_ok

    *   errors

    Please see the following description for details.

  mixer(@module_names)
      # class method
      Net::SNMP->mixer(qw/Net::SNMP::Mixin::Foo/);

      # instance method
      $session->mixer(qw/Net::SNMP::Mixin::Yazz Net::SNMP::Mixin::Brazz/)

    Called as class method mixes the methods for all session instances. This
    is useful for agents supporting the same set of MIBs.

    Called as instance method mixes only for the calling session instance.
    This is useful for SNMP agents not supporting the same set of MIBs and
    therefore not the same set of mixin modules.

    Even the SNMP agents from a big network company don't support the most
    useful standard MIBs. They always use proprietary private enterprise
    MIBs (ring, ring, Cisco, do you hear the bells, grrrmmml).

    The name of the modules to mix-in is passed to this method as a list.
    You can mix class and instance mixins as you like, but importing the
    same mixin module twice is an error.

    Returns the invocant for chaining method calls, dies on error.

  init_mixins($reload)
    This method should be called in void context.

      $session->init_mixins();
      $session->init_mixins(1);

    This method redispatches to every *_init()* method in the loaded mixin
    modules. The raw SNMP values for the mixins are loaded during this call
    - or via callbacks during the snmp_dispatcher event loop for nonblocking
    sessions - and stored in the object space. The mixed methods deliver
    afterwards cooked meal from these values.

    The MIB values are reloaded for the mixins if the argument $reload is
    true. It's an error calling this method twice without forcing $reload.

    If there is an error in a mixin, the rest of the initialization is
    skipped to preserve the current Net::SNMP error message.

    With the init_ok() method, after the snmp_dispatcher run, the successful
    initialization must be checked.

      $session->init_mixins;
      snmp_dispatcher;
      $session->init_ok();
      die scalar $session->errors if $session->errors;

  init_ok($mixin)
      $session->init_ok();
      $session->init_ok('Net::SNMP::Mixin::MyMixin');

    Test if all mixins or a single mixin is proper initialized.

    Returns undef on error. The error is pushed on the sessions error
    buffer.

      die scalar $session->errors unless $session->init_ok();

  errors($clear)
      @errors = $session->errors();
      @errors = $session->errors(1);

    Net::SNMP::error() has only one slot for errors. During nonblocking
    calls it's possible that an error followed by a successful transaction
    is cleared before the user gets the chance to see the error. For the
    mixin modules we use an error buffer until they are explicit cleared.

    This method returns the list of all errors pushed by any mixin module.
    Called in scalar context returns a string of all @errors joined with
    "\n".

    The error buffer is cleared if the argument $clear is true.

GUIDELINES FOR MIXIN AUTHORS
    See the Net::SNMP::Mixin::System module as a blueprint for a simple
    mixin module.

    As a mixin-module author you must respect the following design
    guidelines:

    *   Write more separate mixin-modules instead of 'one module fits all'.

    *   Don't build mutual dependencies with other mixin-modules.

    *   In no circumstance change the given attributes of the calling
        Net::SNMP session instance. In any case stay with the given behavior
        for blocking, translation, debug, retries, timeout, ... of the
        object. Remember it's a mixin and no sub- or superclass.

    *   Don't assume the translation of the SNMP values by default. Due to
        the asynchronous nature of the SNMP calls, you can't rely on the
        output of $session->translate. If you need a special representation
        of a value, you have to check the values itself and perhaps
        translate or untranslate it when needed. See the source of
        Net::SNMP::Mixin::Dot1qVlanStatic for an example.

    *   Implement the *_init()* method and fetch SNMP values only during
        this call. If the session instance is nonblocking use a callback to
        work properly with the *snmp_dispatcher()* event loop. In no
        circumstance load additonal SNMP values outside the *_init()*
        method.

    *   Don't die() on SNMP errors during *_init()*, just return premature
        with no value. The caller is responsible to check the
        *$session->error()* method.

    *   Use Sub::Exporter and export the mixin methods by default.

DEVELOPER INFORMATION
    If mixer() is called as a class method, the mixin-methods are just
    imported into the Net::SNMP package.

    If called as an instance method for the first time, the methods are
    imported into a newly generated, unique package for this session. The
    session instance is reblessed into this new package. The new package
    inherits from the Net::SNMP class. Successive calls for this session
    instance imports just the additional mixin-methods into the already
    generated package for this instance.

SEE ALSO
    Sub::Exporter, and the Net::SNMP::Mixin::... documentations for more
    details about the provided mixin methods.

REQUIREMENTS
    Net::SNMP, Sub::Exporter, Package::Generator, Package::Reaper
