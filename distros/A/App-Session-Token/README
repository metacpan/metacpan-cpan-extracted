NAME
    session-token - command-line script for generating session tokens

USAGE
        $ session-token
        ATXOpAxCu57sVZvoBiWgHg

        $ session-token --entropy 256
        hk0No9bjuknBxmpIujW3bZvnFmryTvEbTPNitd8L9kC

        $ session-token --length 5 --alphabet ACGT --num 3
        GAATT
        ACCAT
        AATTG

        ## If you don't know how many tokens you need at the start of the pipeline...
        $ session-token --infinity | ... | head

DESCRIPTION
    This module came about because I found myself frequently running the
    following command:

        $ perl -MSession::Token -E 'say Session::Token->new->get'
        YwXYXGLMMnudk33MbClseQ

    Before I wrote Session::Token I used to run the following command:

        $ openssl rand -base64 16
        fjxhL/LmZEUQ+NCldQbHgA==

    They both perform essentially the same task however "session-token" has
    various advantages:

    It is more flexible regarding the alphabet used since it supports any
    alphabet that Session::Token does via the "--alphabet" switch. Its
    default alphabet is the (IMO) nice base-62 versus "openssl rand"'s
    base-64.

    It can efficiently generate a large number of random tokens with the
    "--num" switch. Calling "openssl rand" for each token would fork a lot
    of processes and open and read from "/dev/urandom" in each one.

    If cross-platform determinism is required, the "--seed" or "--null-seed"
    switches are available and they don't require seed files or anything.
    Note that you should only use these switches for benchmarks or
    simulations and never for applications requiring secure randomness since
    the generated sequence of tokens will be the same for each run.

    "openssl rand" does some weirdness with reading from/writing to the
    "~/.rnd" file in your home directory as a potential entropy
    source/store. "session-token" will always fail noisily if it can't read
    from "/dev/urandom".

    Finally, "session-token" is easier to remember and type don't you think?
