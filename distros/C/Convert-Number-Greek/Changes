Revision history for Convert::Number::Greek

0.02a   18 November, 2009
        Fixed the tests so they pass under  ‘make test’,  as  well  as
        under ‘prove’.

0.02    18 November, 2009
      • The greek2num function has been added.
      • Perl 5.8.0 has been added as a requirement in Makefile.PL. (It
        never did work  in  5.6;  I  just  forgot  to  specify  that.)

0.01    16 August, 2006
        First version. Only the num2greek function is available.
