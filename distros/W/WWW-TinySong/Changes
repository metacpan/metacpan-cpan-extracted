----------------

 * testing for unexpected results was broken through no fault of this
   module: I guess the Grooveshark/TinySong team wanted to minimize

   search results for "Never Gonna Give You Up"; changed tests to use
   "We Are The Champions" instead, does anyone besides Queen have such
   a song?
