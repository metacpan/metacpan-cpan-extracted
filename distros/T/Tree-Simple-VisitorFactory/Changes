	- Update Makefile.PL and POD to change RT to github.

0.15  2016-05-04T08;15:00

0.14  2016-04-27T17:35:00
	- No code changes.
	- Adopt workflow techniques suggested by Kent Fredric. This means a cleaner workdir and a

0.13  2016-04-25T09:26:00
	- No code changes.
	- Delete Build.PL.
	- Fix my licence (sic) mess so all references are to Perl. This involves edits to Makefile.PL
		and LICENSE. See RT#113949. Thanx Kent Fredric.
	- Fix Makefile.PL so modules only used for testing are in TEST_REQUIRES and not PREREQ_PM.
		See RT#113948. Thanx Kent Fredric.
	- Fix README so it more-or-less conforms to the Perl Foundation's guidelines at
		http://www.perlfoundation.org/cpan_licensing_guidelines.
