NAME
    jawk -- like awk, but post-modern and perly. AKA, Josh's Awk.

SYNOPSIS
    jawk [-x] [-e 'code'] [-d delim] fieldspec [fieldspec...] [--
    (FILES..)]:

    If you haven't seen awk, then jawk can be described as a flexible tool
    for extracting columns of data from text files.

    If you've seen 'awk', then we can describe jawk as a replacement for
    statements like

      awk '{print $N}' 

    which supports ranges, indexing columns by negative numbers, a perl
    mode, and more.

DESCRIPTION
    jawk 1 is somewhat like awk '{print $1}'. Let's start with a fairly
    complex example. Suppose you have a file called 'users.txt' with lines
    of data in this format:

       Bob Elmer, 2716 Fremont Blvd, New York, NY, 12344, ID:91818, CanastaRating:3.1415
       Elmer Fudd, 1 Bunny Hill Drive, Tarrytown, NY, 87654, ID:1, CanastaRating:123456789

    This statement would pull out the 1st, and 3rd through last columns,
    using ', ' as an input delimiter (we've put two spaces between options,
    for clarity):

      jawk  -d', '  1  3..-1  --  users.txt 

    Note the use of negative indexes, the non-default element delimiter via
    `-d', and the `--' anti-option (which indicates that following arguments
    should be considered files to read).

    jawk also allows ranges using the `..' sequence. For example, a field
    specification can look like `A', `A..B', `A..', or `..B', where (`A' and
    `B' can be negative or positive integers.

    Negative values for A and B count backwards, so -1 is the last field.

    Use -- or - FILENAME.txt to read from files. '--' is needed to treat
    FILENAME.txt as file and not fieldspec. See examples below.

    Where you might previously use a command like

      grep pattern file.txt | awk '{print $2}'

    to pull out the 2nd column from a file, you can now do:

      grep pattern file.txt | jawk 2

    jawk offers many other improvements. Here are examples:

    select out the 1st, 3rd, and 4th columns from file

      cat file | jawk 1 3 4

    select all columns except the 1st, and 9th through remaining. Uses the
    -x option for an 'except' meaning.

       cat file | jawk -x 1 9..-1
      
    select out the first through third, and the second to last, and last
    cols from a file.

      cat file | jawk 1..3 -2 -1

    Same as above, but using : as an input delimiter instead of whitespace.
    Note use of -- to start list of files to read from @ARGV, so we can pass
    `file' to jawk directly instead of through `cat'.

      jawk -d: 1..3 -2 -1 -- file 

    There is also a -exe='perlcode' mode where you access the args via @F,
    and not via named positional args. Like so:

      cat file | jawk -e 'print "@F\n";'

OPTIONS
    Here's an explation of all the command-line options:

    `NON-ZERO INTEGER'
        A field specification option indicating that this particular column
        should (or should not, depending on -x, be output).

        Negative indexes count from the right, like in perl, so the
        right-most column is number `-1'.

    `RANGE OF NON-ZERO INTEGERS'
        Integer ranges are specified with `..', and given that A and B are
        non-zero integers, can look like

         A..B
         A..
         ..B

        If you specify ranges in reverse order from their source, like `cat
        file | jawk -1..1' or `cat file | jawk 8-2' you'll get the fields in
        reverse order, like you asked.

    -d delimiter (or -d=delimiter)
        Specify an alternate delimiter in place of '\s+'. If not ' ', the
        delimiter is processed through perl's quotemeta() function and used
        as a regular expression to match between input fields.

    -j joiner (or -j=joiner)
        Specify an alternate join character sequence in place of 'space'.

    -x  Exclude the chosen columns, negating their meaning. Does not
        interoperate with -e 'perlcode' option.

    -e='perlcode' or -e 'perlcode'
        Use perl code passed to process parsed items. Fields come in through
        the @F array, and are 0-indexed (like in perl) instead of 1-indexed
        (like in jawk and cut). A simple example, which shows the first and
        second columns of input, is

           cat file.txt | jawk -e 'print "$F[0] $F[1]\n"'

    -w  Run perl code used with -e option with warnings on. (Strictness is
        always enabled but can be disabled by putting 'no strict' in your
        script).

    --  Ends argument parsing. Used to pass filenames to read from stdin.
        See examples above.
