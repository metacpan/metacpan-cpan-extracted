App-MakeEPUB version 0.0.1

This Module is a wrapper around the script make-epub.

This script takes a directory containing XHTML, images, stylesheets and

The script is intended to be used from the command line or together with

HISTORY

This module started as a script to generate an EPUB ebook from the LaTeX
sources of the german magazine UpTimes (http://www.guug.de/uptimes/). The
script just does the last part of the task: taking the HTML, CSS and image
files below a directory and make an ebook thereof. Later I decided to put it
to more general use and adapted the script to generate EPUB ebooks from the
HTML RFCs at https://tools.ietf.org/html/ (see exampls directory on how to do
this).
