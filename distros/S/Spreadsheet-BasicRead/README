OTHER APPLICATIONS
------------------

Two sample applications are provided, they are:

dumpSS.pl -   Which will dump each row of every sheet to stdout.
              Each row is printed on a single line with a pipe character
              separating each cell value (no special handling of cells that
              contain a pipe character is provided).  Each sheet name is
              printed on a line by itself surrounded by '***'

xlsgrep.pl - Provides a perl regular expression grep function for spreadsheet
             files.  This application will recurse from the current directory
             looking for .xls files to check.  If the contents of a cell matches
             the regular expression provided then the name of the file, the sheet
             name, the row and column numbers (zero indexed) and the cell value
             are printed.
