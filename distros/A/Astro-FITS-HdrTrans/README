Astro::FITS::HdrTrans module
----------------------------

What is it?
-----------
Astro::FITS::HdrTrans and associated sub-classes are tools for translating
instrument-specific FITS headers into generically named headers.

Requirements
------------
The Astro::FITS::HdrTrans module has minimal requirements on other
modules; only Carp and Time::Piece are required. Instrument-specific
sub-classes of Astro::FITS::HdrTrans may require other modules to be
installed, depending on the transformations those sub-classes make.
As an example, the translation sub-class for IRIS2 (an imaging
spectrometer used at the Anglo-Australian Telescope) requires
Math::Trig in order to do zenith distance to airmass translations.

Adding Subclasses
-----------------
Adding subclasses to do translations for other instruments should
be fairly straight-forward. Detailed documentation can be found
in the Astro::FITS::HdrTrans::Base class.

Where can I get it?
-------------------
The package is available from CPAN <http://www.cpan.org/>.

Installation
------------
Installation is automated using the Module::Build library

    % perl Build.PL
    % ./Build
    % ./Build test
    % ./Build install
