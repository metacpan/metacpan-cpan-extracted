NAME
    Finance::Bank::ID::BCA - Check your BCA accounts from Perl

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.49 of Finance::Bank::ID::BCA (from
    Perl distribution Finance-Bank-ID-BCA), released on 2017-07-20.

SYNOPSIS
    If you just want to download banking statements, and you use Linux/Unix,
    you might want to use the download-bca script instead of having to deal
    with this library directly.

    If you want to use the library in your Perl application:

        use Finance::Bank::ID::BCA;

        # FBI::BCA uses Log::ger. to show logs to, for example, screen:
        use Log::ger::Output 'Screen';

        my $ibank = Finance::Bank::ID::BCA->new(
            username => 'ABCDEFGH1234', # opt if only using parse_statement()
            password => '123456',       # idem
            verify_https => 1,          # default is 0
            #https_ca_dir => '/etc/ssl/certs', # default is already /etc/ssl/certs
        );

        eval {
            $ibank->login(); # dies on error

            my @accts = $ibank->list_accounts();

            my $bal = $ibank->check_balance($acct); # $acct is optional

            my $stmt = $ibank->get_statement(
                account    => ..., # opt, default account will be used if undef
                days       => 31,  # opt
                start_date => DateTime->new(year=>2009, month=>10, day=>6),
                                   # opt, takes precedence over 'days'
                end_date   => DateTime->today, # opt, takes precedence over 'days'
            );

            print "Transactions: ";
            for my $tx (@{ $stmt->{transactions} }) {
                print "$tx->{date} $tx->{amount} $tx->{description}\n";
            }
        };
        warn if $@;

        # remember to call this, otherwise you will have trouble logging in again
        # for some time
        $ibank->logout();

    Utility routines:

        # parse HTML statement directly
        my $res = $ibank->parse_statement($html);

DESCRIPTION
    This module provide a rudimentary interface to the web-based online
    banking interface of the Indonesian Bank Central Asia (BCA) at
    https://ibank.klikbca.com. You will need either Crypt::SSLeay or
    IO::Socket::SSL installed for HTTPS support to work (and strictly
    Crypt::SSLeay to enable certificate verification). WWW::Mechanize is
    required but you can supply your own mech-like object.

    This module can only login to the retail/personal version of the site
    (KlikBCA perorangan) and not the corporate/business version (KlikBCA
    bisnis) as the later requires VPN and token input on login. But this
    module can parse statement page from both versions.

    Warning: This module is neither offical nor is it tested to be 100%
    safe! Because of the nature of web-robots, everything may break from one
    day to the other when the underlying web interface changes.

WARNING
    This warning is from Simon Cozens' "Finance::Bank::LloydsTSB", and seems
    just as apt here.

    This is code for online banking, and that means your money, and that
    means BE CAREFUL. You are encouraged, nay, expected, to audit the source
    of this module yourself to reassure yourself that I am not doing
    anything untoward with your banking data. This software is useful to me,
    but is provided under NO GUARANTEE, explicit or implied.

ERROR HANDLING AND DEBUGGING
    Most methods die() when encountering errors, so you can use eval() to
    trap them.

    Full response headers and bodies are dumped to a separate logger. See
    documentation on "new()" below and the sample script in examples/
    subdirectory in the distribution.

ATTRIBUTES
METHODS
  new(%args)
    Create a new instance. %args keys:

    *   username

        Optional if you are just using utility methods like
        "parse_statement()" and not "login()" etc.

    *   password

        Optional if you are just using utility methods like
        "parse_statement()" and not "login()" etc.

    *   mech

        Optional. A WWW::Mechanize-like object. By default this module
        instantiate a new Finance::BankUtils::ID::Mechanize (a
        WWW::Mechanize subclass) object to retrieve web pages, but if you
        want to use a custom/different one, you are allowed to do so here.
        Use cases include: you want to retry and increase timeout due to
        slow/unreliable network connection (using
        WWW::Mechanize::Plugin::Retry), you want to slow things down using
        WWW::Mechanize::Sleepy, you want to use IE engine using
        Win32::IE::Mechanize, etc.

    *   verify_https

        Optional. If you are using the default mech object (see previous
        option), you can set this option to 1 to enable SSL certificate
        verification (recommended for security). Default is 0.

        SSL verification will require a CA bundle directory, default is
        /etc/ssl/certs. Adjust https_ca_dir option if your CA bundle is not
        located in that directory.

    *   https_ca_dir

        Optional. Default is /etc/ssl/certs. Used to set HTTPS_CA_DIR
        environment variable for enabling certificate checking in
        Crypt::SSLeay. Only used if verify_https is on.

    *   logger

        Optional. You can supply any object that responds to trace(),
        debug(), info(), warn(), error(), or fatal() here. If not specified,
        this module will use a default logger.

    *   logger_dump

        Optional. This is just like "logger" but this module will log
        contents of response here instead of to "logger" for debugging
        purposes. You can configure something like
        Log::ger::Output::DirWriteRotate to save web pages more conveniently
        as separate files. If unspecified, the default logger is used (same
        as "logger").

  login()
    Login to the net banking site. You actually do not have to do this
    explicitly as login() is called by other methods like "check_balance()"
    or "get_statement()".

    If login is successful, "logged_in" will be set to true and subsequent
    calls to "login()" will become a no-op until "logout()" is called.

    Dies on failure.

  logout()
    Logout from the net banking site. You need to call this at the end of
    your program, otherwise the site will prevent you from re-logging in for
    some time (e.g. 10 minutes).

    If logout is successful, "logged_in" will be set to false and subsequent
    calls to "logout()" will become a no-op until "login()" is called.

    Dies on failure.

  list_accounts()
    Return an array containing all account numbers that are associated with
    the current net banking login.

  check_balance([$account])
    Return balance for specified account, or the default account if $account
    is not specified.

  get_statement(%args) => $stmt
    Get account statement. %args keys:

    *   account

        Optional. Select the account to get statement of. If not specified,
        will use the already selected account.

    *   days

        Optional. Number of days between 1 and 31. If days is 1, then start
        date and end date will be the same. Default is 31.

    *   start_date

        Optional. Default is end_date - days.

    *   end_date

        Optional. Default is today (or some 1+ days from today if today is a
        Saturday/Sunday/holiday, depending on the default value set by the
        site's form).

    See parse_statement() on structure of $stmt.

  parse_statement($html, %opts) => $res
    Given the HTML text of the account statement results page, parse it into
    structured data:

     $stmt = {
        start_date     => $start_dt, # a DateTime object
        end_date       => $end_dt,   # a DateTime object
        account_holder => STRING,
        account        => STRING,    # account number
        currency       => STRING,    # 3-digit currency code
        transactions   => [
            # first transaction
            {
              date        => $dt,  # a DateTime obj, book date ("tanggal pembukuan")
              seq         => INT,  # a number >= 1 which marks the sequence of
                                   # transactions for the day
              amount      => REAL, # a real number, positive means credit (deposit),
                                   # negative means debit (withdrawal)
              description => STRING,
              is_pending  => BOOL,
              branch      => STRING, # a 4-digit branch/ATM code
              balance     => REAL,
            },
            # second transaction
            ...
        ]
     }

    Returns:

     [$status, $err_details, $stmt]

    $status is 200 if successful or some other 3-digit code if parsing
    failed. $stmt is the result (structure as above, or undef if parsing
    failed).

    Options:

    *   return_datetime_obj => BOOL

        Default is true. If set to false, the method will return dates as
        strings with this format: 'YYYY-MM-DD HH::mm::SS' (produced by
        DateTime->dmy . ' ' . DateTime->hms). This is to make it easy to
        pass the data structure into YAML, JSON, MySQL, etc. Nevertheless,
        internally DateTime objects are still used.

    Additional notes:

    The method can also handle some copy-pasted text from the GUI browser,
    but this is no longer documented or guaranteed to keep working.
