# Revision history for WWW-Wikipedia-TemplateFiller

version: 0.13
date:    2009-05-14
changes:n
  - shifting more parameters to output()-time in PubmedId.pm
  - add "omit_url_if_doi_filled" parameter in PubmedId.pm
  - add missing period to "et al." in PubmedId.pm
  - improved (but currently unused) data structure for parameters in
    WebApp.pm

version: 0.12
date:    2009-04-16
changes:
  - add "full_journal_title" fill-time option to PubmedId.pm
    (requires Lingua::EN::Titlecase)
  - suppress 'no isbndb_access_key provided' warning during 'make test'
  - fix problem in which the journal 'Science' was expanded to the
    aberration 'Science (journal)'
  - only if 'link_journal' is enabled is 'Science' expanded to
    'Science (journal)'. And even then, it is used to specify the
    first portion of "[[Science (journal)|Science]]".

version: 0.11
date:    2009-02-20
changes:
  - add "add_iupac_name" fill-time option to PubchemId.pm (see
    http://tinyurl.com/dm3hot)

version: 0.10
date:    2009-01-29
changes:
  - (bug #42908) rename "chembox new" to "chembox"
  - Ugly hack for Mac OS X's case-insensitive but case-preserving
    filesystem

version: 0.09
date:    2008-11-25
changes:
  - (bug #41162) another attempt to fix 'make test' in perl 5.10.x
  - this entailed removing references to sprintf() in the code, as
    sprintf() is currently complaining about the use of tainted
    values.
    (cf. http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=41162#txn-537097)

version: 0.08
date:    2008-11-23
changes:
  - (bug #41162) fix 'make test' in perl 5.10.x
  - in fixing above, switched template parameter descriptions from
    older 'field', '-field', and '+field' notation to using more
    descriptive names in a hash (eg, "field => { value => 'foo', show
    => 'if-extended' }", etc.)

version: 0.07
date:    2008-11-18
changes:
  - (bug #41053) get() now dies if $id is undefined
  - in fixing this bug, change W::W::TF::S::PubmedcentralId.pm to no
    longer inherit from PubmedId; now calls to get() are routed
    through $self->filler->get() to ensure that W::W::TF's get()
    (which appropriately handles empty IDs) is called
  - WebApp.pm now traps errors thrown during template filling and
    issues error message appropriately, preventing the die() from
    being propagated to Apache

version: 0.06

changes:
  - (bug #41005) vertical pipes in HTML page titles are escaped to
