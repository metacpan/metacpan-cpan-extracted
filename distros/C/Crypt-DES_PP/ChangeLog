	* DES_PP.m4:
	Bumped version number to 1.00.  The D_ENCRYPT macro has been simplified
	and made faster.  Update documentation.  Performance of version 1.00 is
	more than 20 % better than version 0.07.

	* .cvsignore: README is now generated.

	* Makefile.PL: Generate README with pod2text.

	* INSTALL, README:
	Moved contents of README to INSTALL.  README is now generated by pod2text
	so that PAUSE will extract something useful.

	* DES_PP.m4:
	Minor optimizations (unrolling the loops had negative effect, discarded).

	* DES_PP.m4:
	Replaced preprocessor version with m4 source file.  See the file itself
	for a discussion of the advantages of m4 over the preprocessor.
	Additionally for performance reasons the two nested array references
	"des_skb" and "des_SPtrans" have been split up into distinct
	constants.

	* MANIFEST: DES_PP.ppp replaced by DES_PP.m4.

	* DES_PP.ppp: Replaced by DES_PP.m4.

	* Makefile.PL:
	Added lib/Crypt/DES_PP.pm as an additional Makefile target.

	* MANIFEST: Renamed DES_PP.ppm to DES_PP.ppp.

	* DES_PP.ppp: Bumped version number to 0.07.
	Renamed DES_PP.ppm to DES_PP.ppp.

	* DES_PP.ppm, Makefile.PL:
	Renamed DES_PP.ppm (oops, used by Activestate Perl) to DES_PP.ppp
	(like pre-process perl).
	Makefile now retrieves version information directly from DES_PP.ppp.
	Filter out preprocessor line numbers from output so that Perl reports
	linenumbers correctly when a warning or error occurs.

	* DES_PP.ppm:
	Fixed typo/thinko (don't remember) in crypt().  Should now run
	on big-endian machines, too.  Thanks to schinder@pobox.com for
	the bug report, thanks to Frank Naumann (fnaumann@freemint.de)
	for giving me access to his big-endian MiNT machine for debugging.

	* DES_PP.ppm: Bumped version number to 0.06.

	* test.pl:
	Eval dependencies to other modules in single quotes, not in curly
	braces to avoid the test to fail if Crypt::CBC is not present.

	* t/cbcref.t:
	Don't print a test number for bulk output when Crypt::CBC is not
	present, so that Test::Harness doesn't get confused.
