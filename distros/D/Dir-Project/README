NAME

    Dir::Project - Project Environment determination

SYNOPSIS

      # Perl
      use Dir::Project;
      Dir::Project::get_set_all();

      # Makefiles
      include $(DIRPROJECT_PREFIX)/lib/project_dir.mk

      # Example script dispatching
      cd ~/project1
      project_dir --project
         /path/to/project1
      my_tool my_args....   # Executes project1/.../my_tool

      cd ~/project2
      project_dir --project
         /path/to/project2
      my_tool my_args....   # Executes project2/.../my_tool

DESCRIPTION

    Dir::Project provides a way to locate a source-controlled directory
    (CVS, Subversion, Perforce, Git, etc) using only the current working
    directory (cd). This prevents users from having to set other environment
    variables when they switch between areas.

    Project_bin allows a single symlink to a user script to be placed in a
    global PATH. Project_bin then automatically finds that script inside the
    source controlled area. Different users, or different checkouts will
    execute the script in their areas. Thus, problems with version mismatch
    across executing tools are eliminated.

ENVIRONMENT SETUP

    To use project_bin, you should make the following settings in your
    .bashrc or equivalent group file:

       export DIRPROJECT_PREFIX=/prefix     # Any global project prefix
       export PATH=$DIRPROJECT_PREFIX/bin:$PATH

    Then for each executable that lives in your source control area that you
    wish to dispatch to, you create a simlink:

       ln -s project_bin $DIRPROJECT_PREFIX/dir/my_tool

    or, instead, make my_tool a script to run project_bin as described in
    project_bin.

    More details in project_bin.

USAGE IN SCRIPTS

    Dir::Project may be used three different ways inside scripts.

    First, a script may be totally ignorant of Dir::Project. Simply by
    placing it in a directory that is part of DIRPROJECT_PATH, and creating
    a symlink from project_bin, it will be executed automatically based on a
    search starting at the current directory.

    Second, a script that is always executed by project_bin can get the root
    of the checkout by using $DIRPROJECT. Generally I cache the value of
    DIRPROJECT in a variable called simply $Project.

        BEGIN {
            $Project = $ENV{DIRPROJECT} or die "%Error: Can't determine DIRPROJECT: Call me with project_bin, stopped";
        }
        ....
        my $path_to_file = "$Project/under/project/file/path...";

    Third, a script may determine DIRPROJECT itself by using Dir::Project
    directly. This does not require project_bin to be used to call the
    program.

        use Dir::Project;
        BEGIN {
            Dir::Project::get_set_project();
            $Project = $ENV{DIRPROJECT} or die "%Error: Can't determine PROJECT: Call this under a project, stopped";
        }
        ....
        my $path_to_file = "$Project/under/project/file/path...";

USAGE IN MAKEFILES

    Dir::Project may be called from inside a Makefile. The include will set
    the DIRPROJECT variable that can then be used to replace absolute paths
    inside the makefile.

        include $(DIRPROJECT_PREFIX)/lib/project_dir.mk
        # That include will set $(DIRPROJECT) which you can then use
        # to find files underneath the repository checkout.
        ....
        PATHS = $(DIRPROJECT)/path/under/repo

    Or, if you only need the DIRPROJECT variable, you can more simply:

       DIRPROJECT := $(shell dir_project --project)

USAGE IN EMACS / VERILOG-MODE

    Dir::Project may be used with the AUTOs of Verilog-Mode for Emacs.

    Install the contrib/dir-project.el file as described at the top of that
    file. Restart Emacs.

    Now in your source tree create an input.vc file similar to the
    following:

       -v project/path/to/rtl

    The various Verilog module files would then end in a reference to the
    file you just created:

       // Local Variables:
       // verilog-library-flags:("-f ../../../../input.vc")
       // End:

    When AUTOs are expanded the input.vc file will be read. The
    dir-project.el hook will change the project/ links to an absolute file
    and that will allow finding any submodules.

    An alternative technique is to use $DIRPROJECT/path/to/rtl in the
    input.vc and setting the DIRPROJECT environment variable. However
    several EDA tools do not support environment variable expansion in .vc
    files, thus the above project/ technique.

METHODS

    get_set_all()
        Set all variables, including get_set_project.

    get_set_project()
        Set $Project and $ENV{DIRPROJECT}.

    makefile()
        Create a makefile with the appropriate make code to set DIRPROJECT.
        This file is then included by make to set the variable.

    makefile_cat()
        Print the makefile with the appropriate make code to set DIRPROJECT.

    program_paths(program=>*name*)
        Return a list of paths the program may live at. Uses
        $DIRPROJECT_PATH and $DIRPROJECT_PREFIX resolved with the current
        project to determine the list.

    program_bin(paths=>\*@list*)
        Return the first readable file in the list of paths, or undef if
        none found.

    undefine_all()
        Remove all environment variables.

ENVIRONMENT

    DIRPROJECT
        Points to the top directory of the project source-controlled area.
        It is created by Dir::Project::get_set_all.

    DIRPROJECT_DEBUG
        Set when project_bin is invoked with --debug.

    DIRPROJECT_PATH
        A colon-separated list of directories that program_paths() and
        project_bin should search for executables within. Generally contains
        a leading project/ in front of all directories, this will be
        converted to $DIRPROJECT, though it may also be absolute directory
        names to search for if the project is not found. Set by the user's
        .bashrc or similar login script.

    DIRPROJECT_PREFIX
        A global directory like the --prefix passed to most configure
        scripts. Used by program_paths() and project_bin to create the
        default $DIRPROJECT_PREFIX/bin/{program}__not_found link. Set by the
        user's .bashrc or similar login script.

    DIRPROJECT_PROJECTDIREXE
        Path and executable for project_dir. Used by project_dir.mk.
        Generally can be left unset, so it will default to just project_dir
        (without any directory prefix) so it will be found using PATH.

    DIRPROJECT_EXE
        The last executable run by project_bin. Set by project_bin.
