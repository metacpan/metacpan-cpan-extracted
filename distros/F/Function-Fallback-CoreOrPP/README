SYNOPSIS

     use Function::Fallback::CoreOrPP qw(clone unbless uniq);
    
     my $clone = clone({blah=>1});
     my $unblessed = unbless($blessed_ref);
     my @uniq  = uniq(1, 3, 2, 1, 4);  # -> (1, 3, 2, 4)

DESCRIPTION

    This module provides functions that use non-core XS modules (for best
    speed, reliability, feature, etc) but falls back to those that use core
    XS or pure-Perl modules when the non-core XS module is not available.

    This module helps when you want to bootstrap your Perl application with
    a portable, dependency-free Perl script. In a vanilla Perl installation
    (having only core modules), you can use App::FatPacker to include
    non-core pure-Perl dependencies to your script.

FUNCTIONS

 clone($data) => $cloned

    Try to use Data::Clone's clone, but fall back to using Clone::PP's
    clone.

 clone_list(@data) => @data

    A shortcut for:

     return map {clone($_)} @data

 unbless($ref) => $unblessed_ref

    Try to use Acme::Damn's damn to unbless a reference but fall back to
    shallow copying.

    NOTE: damn() MODIFIES the original reference. (XXX in the future an
    option to clone the reference first will be provided), while shallow
    copying will return a shallow copy.

    NOTE: The shallow copy method currently only handles blessed
    {scalar,array,hash}ref as those are the most common.

 uniq(@ary) => @uniq_ary

    Try to use List::MoreUtils's uniq, but fall back to using slower,
    pure-Perl implementation.

SEE ALSO

    Clone::Any can also uses multiple backends, but I avoid it because I
    don't think Storable's dclone should be used (no Regexp support out of
    the box + must use deparse to handle coderefs).
