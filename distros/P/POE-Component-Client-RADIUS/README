DESCRIPTION
    POE::Component::Client::RADIUS is a POE Component that provides Remote
    Authentication Dial In User Service (RADIUS) client services to other
    POE sessions and components.

    RADIUS is commonly used by ISPs and corporations managing access to
    Internet or internal networks and is an AAA (authentication,
    authorisation, and accounting) protocol.

    The component deals with the transmission and receiving of RADIUS
    packets and uses the excellent Net::Radius::Packet and
    Net::Radius::Dictionary modules to construct the RADIUS packets.

    Currently only PAP authentication is supported. Help and advice would be
    appreciated on implementing others. See contact details below.

CONSTRUCTORS
    One may start POE::Component::Client::RADIUS in two ways. If you spawn
    it creates a session that can then broker lots of RADIUS requests on
    your behalf. Or you may use 'authenticate' and 'accounting' to broker
    'one-shot' instances.

      POE::Component::Client::RADIUS->spawn( ... );

      POE::Component::Client::RADIUS->authenticate( ... );

      POE::Component::Client::RADIUS->accounting( ... );

    "spawn"
        Creates a new POE::Component::Client::RADIUS session that may be
        used lots of times. Takes the following parameters:

          'dict', a Net::Radius::Dictionary object reference, mandatory;
          'alias', set an alias that you can use to address the component later;
          'options', a hashref of POE session options;

        Returns an POE::Component::Client::RADIUS object.

    "authenticate"
        Creates a one-shot POE::Component::Client::RADIUS session that will
        send an authentication request, receive the response and then
        terminates. Takes the following mandatory parameters:

          'dict', a Net::Radius::Dictionary object reference;
          'server', IP address of the RADIUS server to communicate with;
          'username', the username to authenticate;
          'password', the user's password;
          'attributes', a hashref of RADIUS attributes to construct the packet from;
          'secret', a shared secret between this RADIUS client and the RADIUS server;
          'event', the event in the calling session that will be triggered with the response;

        'attributes' must be provided, but may be an empty hashref. The
        component will make up any necessary attributes to send. Check with
        the RADIUS RFC <http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2138.html> for details.

        One can also pass arbitary data which will be passed back in the
        response event. It is advised that one uses an underscore prefix to
        avoid clashes with future versions.

    "accounting"
        Creates a one-shot POE::Component::Client::RADIUS session that will
        send an accounting request, receive the response and then
        terminates. Takes the following mandatory parameters:

          'dict', a Net::Radius::Dictionary object reference;
          'server', IP address of the RADIUS server to communicate with;
          'type', the type of accounting request;
          'attributes', a hashref of RADIUS attributes to construct the packet from;
          'secret', a shared secret between this RADIUS client and the RADIUS server;
          'event', the event in the calling session that will be triggered with the response;

        Check with the RADIUS Accounting RFC
        <http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2866.html> for what one may specify as
        'type' and 'attributes'.

        One can also pass arbitary data which will be passed back in the
        response event. It is advised that one uses an underscore prefix to
        avoid clashes with future versions.

METHODS
    "session_id"
        Takes no arguments. Returns the POE Session ID of the component.

    "shutdown"
        Terminates the component.

INPUT EVENTS
    When "spawn"ed, the component will accept the following events:

    "authenticate"
        Send an authentication request, receive the response and trigger a
        result event back to the sending session. Takes the following
        mandatory parameters:

          'server', IP address of the RADIUS server to communicate with;
          'username', the username to authenticate;
          'password', the user's password;
          'attributes', a hashref of RADIUS attributes to construct the packet from;
          'secret', a shared secret between this RADIUS client and the RADIUS server;
          'event', the event in the calling session that will be triggered with the response;

        'attributes' must be provided, but may be an empty hashref. The
        component will make up any necessary attributes to send. Check with
        the RADIUS RFC <http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2138.html> for details.

        One can also pass arbitary data which will be passed back in the
        response event. It is advised that one uses an underscore prefix to
        avoid clashes with future versions.

    "accounting"
        Send an accounting request, receive the response and trigger a
        result event back to the sending session. Takes the following
        mandatory parameters:

          'server', IP address of the RADIUS server to communicate with;
          'type', the type of accounting request;
          'attributes', a hashref of RADIUS attributes to construct the packet from;
          'secret', a shared secret between this RADIUS client and the RADIUS server;
          'event', the event in the calling session that will be triggered with the response;

        Check with the RADIUS Accounting RFC
        <http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2866.html> for what one may specify as
        'type' and 'attributes'.

        One can also pass arbitary data which will be passed back in the
        response event. It is advised that one uses an underscore prefix to
        avoid clashes with future versions.

    "shutdown"
        Terminates the component.

OUTPUT EVENTS
    The component returns the specified event to all requests to the calling
    session.

    ARG0 will be a hashref, which contains the original parameters (
    including any arbitary data ), plus either one of the following two
    keys:

      'response', will contain a hashref of RADIUS attributes returned by the RADIUS server;
      'timeout', indicates that the component timed out waiting for a response from the RADIUS server;
      'error', in lieu of a valid response, this will be defined with a brief description of what went wrong;

    The component will only report an error if there is an error with
    communicating with the RADIUS server in some way. Please check the
    contents of the 'response' hashref for the status of authenication
    requests etc.

BUGS
    There are bound to be bugs in this. Please report any you find via
