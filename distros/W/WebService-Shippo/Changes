Revision history for WebService-Shippo
 
0.0.21    2015-11-14 23:19:22+00:00 Europe/London
    - The currency refresh in WebService::Shippo::Currency now fails
      quietly, falling back to the hard-coded snapshot.
    - Some tidying up and a little re-factoring
0.0.20    2015-11-12 19:02:44+00:00 Europe/London
    - De-clutter interface to main package
    - Clean up serialization a bit
    - The collection "count" method works as a static method
    - POD updates
0.0.19    2015-11-12 01:45:32+00:00 Europe/London
    - Didn't run tests before releasing 0.0.18 to CPAN.
    - Should have run tests before releasing 0.0.18 to CPAN.
    - Travis you're the best!
    - Clear out debug from tests causing one failure and fix a 
      serialization bug in another test.
    - Once more, with feeling...
0.0.18    2015-11-12 01:32:55+00:00 Europe/London
    - Some work on the iterator
    - A new collector added, which uses the iterator to gather matches
      and some very basic tests.
    - A slew of POD updates
0.0.17    2015-11-10 19:10:39+00:00 Europe/London
    - Much POD, so wow!
    - Separated Item and Collection class definitions to ease
      their documentation.
    - Locale::Codes and Locale::Currency both pretty hairy to use
      accross different versions of Perl. Have come up with a 
      different plan until one of thoses works consistently on 
      on Perl versions.
0.0.16    2015-11-09 22:32:19+00:00 Europe/London
    - Some of the ancillary modules that didn't create Shippo::
      namespace aliases now do so for the sake of consistency.
    - There were some symbols exported on request and via tag :all; 
      they're no longer exported at all because I'm not sure they'll
      be used anyway.
    - Begun to separate API entity classes from their collection classes
      to make documentation easier. I'll continue this in the next release.
    - POD updates.
0.0.15    2015-11-08 21:19:47+00:00 Europe/London
    - With the exception of "id" methods that didn't started with
      "object_" but were identical in function to AUTOLOADed methods
      that did have that prefix have now been removed.
    - AUTOLOADed methods with always return '' instead of undef.
    - Collection classes (always the plural form of the item class) now
      respond to the Creator, Fetcher, Updater interfaces.
    - POD updates.
0.0.14    2015-11-05 21:09:08+00:00 Europe/London
    - Some tidying up
    - Some documentation
    - A slow day
0.0.13    2015-11-03 20:06:01+00:00 Europe/London
    - Some POD stubs added.
0.0.12    2015-11-03 18:55:11+00:00 Europe/London
    - Address->validate no longer refreshes subject of method call if 
      that subject is an address. The returned object is a validated
      address, not an opportunity to enrich the subject.
    - to_json is pretty if also passed a true as second argument
    - AUTOLOAD methods defined as pure accessors, not as mutators.
    - All entities now implement an iterator using the iterator method
    - Fix buggy ObjectList page transitions. Results were not correctly
      blessed as items but as lists.
    - Lots of stuff that just didn't smell right either got fixed or
      re-factored.
0.0.11    2015-11-02 17:31:00+00:00 Europe/London
    - The CarrierAccount "active" and "production" mutators have been
      replaced with "activate", "deactivate", "enable_test_mode" and
      "enable_production_mode" methods.
    - The non-OO interface is history; seems a little pointless
    - We're working with JSON a lot and so too is the client (probably)
      so the boolean, true, false functions brought in by boolean pragma
      are exported by default. So is callback.
    - Some re-factoring.
    - Now beginning to work on POD.
0.0.10    2015-10-25 19:56:30+00:00 Europe/London
    - Basic Authorization added.
    - Numerous doc and test change.
    - Had to remove Try::Tiny because it was giving grief under 5.8.8
    - Still having grief with Locale::Currency which works on some Perls
      and not others. If I avoid the really poor public interface with the
      patchy support on earlier and later versions of Perl, and use the 
      private Locale::Codes interface, I only have problems on Perl 5.14.
      Fighting the urge to avoid using it altogether by eliminating the
      dependency and replacing it with something that works properly and
      consistently. Grumble, grumble. Hope it can be fixed. And tested. On
      lots and lots of different Perls. Because that's good. Right?
0.0.9     2015-10-24 23:41:44+01:00 Europe/London
    - A reasonable minimum set of test finished. There can always be more
      tests and there will be in the future. At 96.1% coverage (local), 93%
      (Github), I'm now going to get some documentation done.
0.0.8     2015-10-24 16:16:29+01:00 Europe/London
    - Interim release.
    - Entities with asynchronous work-flows stable.
    - More tests.
    - More refactoring.
0.0.7     2015-10-20 20:00:55+01:00 Europe/London
    - Interim release (no more until the 23rd when I return home).
    - More core tests added for Rate and Shipment entities.
    - Most of the important user-facing methods take blocking callbacks.
    - A metric ton of re-factoring.
    - And a partridge in a pear tree.
0.0.6     2015-10-19 23:34:42+01:00 Europe/London
    - Interim release (reasonably stable)
    - More tests added
    - Lots of re-factoring (particularly of test code)

0.0.5     2015-10-19 20:16:14+01:00 Europe/London
    - Interim release (reasonably stable).
    - More tests added.
    - Lots and lots of re-factoring.
    
0.0.4     2015-10-17 00:01:33+01:00 Europe/London
    - Interim release.

0.0.3     2015-10-16 17:55:27+01:00 Europe/London
    - Interim release.
    
0.0.2     2015-10-16 01:07:52+01:00 Europe/London
    - Interim release.
    - API appears functional. Cruddy developer tests will now be built-out
      into something more useful and robust. Naturally, documentation is
      going to be forthcoming, too.
    
0.0.1     2015-10-15 14:30:34+01:00 Europe/London
    - Initial version.
