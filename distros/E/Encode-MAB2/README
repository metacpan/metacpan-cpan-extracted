About this distro
-----------------

This collection of modules provides interfaces to data in the MAB2
format. The MAB2 format ("Maschinelle Austauschformat fuer
Bibliotheken") is used by German libraries to store and exchange data
about books, authors, institutions and key words.

The modules work on three levels: strings, records, and collections of
records. The modules build upon each other. Please read the
documentations that comes with each of the modules for further info.
