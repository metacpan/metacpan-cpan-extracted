    - also odity with IO::file fixed (Brandon Black once again)

0.06 Fri Nov 8 2002
    - finally found someone with a solaris box to work out reason for
      unexpected test failures. Thanks to John D. Robinson and Jeroen Latour
      Details available at: http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=211401
    - Removed another new bug relating to test scripts rather than core code
      thanks to the combined effors of Perlmonks tommyw, grinder, Jaap, vek,
      erasei, jlongino and strider_corinth
0.07 Sat Aug 2 2003
    - i admit to abject slackness, but anyway finally allocated a few hours
      to apply a number of bug fixes which are (in no particular order)
    - mod_perl compliant, patched by Mathew Albright
        - still need to comment out use Selfloader and __DATA__ token
        - still thinking about other solutions to this
    - Blessed globs now possible in the constructor thanks to chromatic
    - Unicode error  0xfe |  ($c >> 30) -> 0xfc | ($c >>30 ) fixed thanks to
      Thomas L. Shinnick
    - s/$value ||= 0/$value = defined $value ? $value : ''/ in raw_fetch() method
      in Cookie.pm to allow value 0.
    - Added missing $VERSION to Util.pm
    - Added P3P support as suggested by Marc Bauer (parallels CGI.pm)
        - updated header() and redirect() methods in Simple.pm
0.071 Sat Aug 2 2003
    - Oops, changed $VERSION to 0.007 not 0.07 so have to change to 0.071 to
      upload again. ;-)
    - no significant changes since 0.07 (aka 0.007) ;-)
0.072 Tue Sept 9 2003
    - Patched issue with large POSTs where data may not be on STDIN for single
      read call. Bug exists in CGI.pm as well. Thanks to Jason Luther
    - Added tests for slow post behaviour
0.075 Tue June 1 2004
    - Meant to upload 0.73 and 0.074 but just never got around to it
    - Fixed upload hang bug in certain circumstances
    - Added upload_fieldnames() method by request
    - Added support for $fh = upload('field_name') but this has the issue
      of what to do if 'field_name' is duplicated. You can only ever get one
      fh from this method unlike the favoured approach using param() to get
      the filename(s) which will let you get to all the files.
    - José Micó deserves plaudits as does PodMaster.
0.076
    - Went missing in action.
0.077 Tue 23 Nov 2004
    - Bugfix patches.
    - José Micó supplied patch that relates to character set allowed in headers.
      TAB and high ascii chars are definitivelly allowed in headers, and not
      accepting them prevents the upload of files with filenames like "España.txt".
    - José Micó also notes that some versions of IE send extra boundaries in
      POSTed data before real ones. New patch should be fix this IE issue.
    - Lars Thegler supplied some patches.
        - head2/head3 pod changed to head1/head2 for the benefit of some older
          tools that exepect this.
        - Resolved issue with manpages not being installed on FREEBSD via Makefile
          hack
    - Steve Purkis supplied a patch for a serious POST_MAX bug. A small modification
      to control flow was used instead but this was a serious bug. If you are reading
      this you are probably upgrading which is good.

0.078 2007-01-09
    - Maintenance release by Andy Armstrong <andy@hexten.net>
    - Rewrote tests to use Test::More
    - Implemented mod_perl 2 support

      Edwards for the patch.
      
0.081 2007-05-20
    - Fix for sysread under mod_perl. Thanks to Joshua N Pritikin for
      the patch.

0.082 2007-05-22
    - Added REST support. Thanks to Mike Barry for the patch.

0.83  2007-05-22
    - Big version jump to move version past badly formatted version in
      Cookie, Util.

1.0  2007-05-24
   - Another big version jump. I think we're about ready for 1.0.
   - Fixed skip count under Win32 in t/40.request.t [27257]. Thanks to
     ISHIGAKI for the patch.

1.1  2007-07-13
   - Added support for Set-Cookie as per CGI.pm patch 15065. Thanks to
     Patrick M. Jordan for the suggestion.

1.1.1   2007-07-31
      - Removed nasty global trap of __DIE__ in CGI::Standard. Thanks to
        Jeremy Morton for reporting it.

1.1.2   2007-07-31
      - Fixed module names in POD for CGI::Simple::Cookie,
        CGI::Simple::Util [#27597]. Thanks to BRICAS for reporting it.

1.103   2007-07-31
      - Version number chaos continues. One tends to forget that there
        is a strange universe in which 1.1 > 1.1.2.

1.104   2008-05-13
      - Switched from sysread to read. Fixes #35844: sysread used in
        CGI::Simple blocks on re-directed STDIO reads. Thanks to
        Damjan Pelemis.

1.105   2008-05-16
      - Fixed skip count in t/040.request.t. Fixes #35945. Thanks
        to snaury.

1.106   2008-09-14
      - Added missing Apache2 modules. Refs #39146 and #38931. Thanks
        to RSAVAGE.
      - Applied BEROV's patch for UTF-8 form data handling. Refs #12481.
        Thanks to BEROV.

1.107   2009-03-07
      - CGI::Simple::Cookie, fixed bug when cookie had both leading and
        trailing white space (RT#34314, Ron Savage and Mark Stosberg)
      - Accept a comma as well as semi-colon as a cookie separator. This
        is consistent with CGI.pm as well as RFC 2965, which states: "A
        server SHOULD also accept comma (,) as the separator between cookie-
        values for future compatibility." (Mark Stosberg)
      - Support cookies which have an equals sign in the value. Ported
        from CGI.pm (Mark Stosberg)
      - Support cookies in which one of multiple values is empty. Ported
        from CGI.pm (Mark Stosberg)
      - Fixed bug when calling unescapeHTML on HTML that wasn't
        properly escaped in the first place. Thanks to M-Uchino and
        Mark Stosberg.
      - Removed bogus dependency on version.pm.
      - Add heuristic to upload to handle the case where no boundary is
        specified in CONTENT_TYPE. See #14838.

1.108   2009-03-13
      - Remove bogus references to Selfloader in documenation. No
        functional changes.

1.109   2009-04-16
      - Added support for HttpOnly to CGI::Simple::Cookie. Thanks to
        Scott Thomson for the patch.

1.110   2009-05-24
      - Added missing test to manifest / distro.
      - Added a test to ensure the manifest is consistent.
      - Migrated to git.

1.111   2009-05-28
      - Implemented Michael Nachbaur fixes for multipart form data
        handling.

1.112   2009-05-31
      - (thanks bingos) added missing IO::Scalar dependency.

1.113   2010-12-27
      - (thanks to Yamada Masahiro) randomise multipart boundary string
        (security).

      - Numerous changes from Mark Stosberg:

        Port max-age support from CGI.pm, to improve compatibility and
        RFC-compliance

        Correct header comment in cookie.t
        
        It claims that is a simple copy/paste/modify from CGI.pm's test
        by the same name, but this has not been true for some time--
        CGI::Simple added

        httponly tests that CGI.pm lacks, for example.

        Sync cookie references with CGI.pm: add reference to the
        newer RFC 2695

        "Interface to browse cookies" looks like it was typo for
        "browser". HTTP is more precise.

        Fix awkward "CGI::Simple.pm" language. It looks like it probably
        originated from the CGI.pm form. "CGI::Simple" is used instead.

        Best Practice: eliminate indirect object notation from new(),
        parse() and fetch() calls

        Security: Fix handling of embedded malicious newlines in header
          values This is a direct port of the same security fix that

        Security: use a random MIME boundary by default in
          multipart_init(). This is a direct port of the same issue
          which was addressed in CGI.pm, preventing some kinds of
          potential header injection attacks.

        Port from CGI.pm: Fix multi-line header parsing.
          This fix is covered by the tests in t/header.t added in
          the previous patch. If you run those tests without this
          patch, you'll see how the headers would be malformed
          without this fix.

        Port CRLF injection prevention from CGI.pm

        Optimize Vars(): Don't build %hash if we aren't going to use it.

        Micro-optimization to Vars(): Don't call "tie" unless we need to.

      - Numerous changes from K. Berov:

        Added "+" to the mime character class.

        Added tests for C<$mime = $q->upload_info( $filename, 'mime' );>

        Fixed wrong match for mimetypes. Example: matched only
        'application/vnd' instead of 'application/vnd.ms-excel'.

        Added "\." to the mime character class

1.114
      - Drop support for Perls older than 5.6.1.

1.115 2014.10.19
      - Replace indirect calling of constructor both in code an documentation
        with direct calling.
        Write  CGI::Simle->new   instead of    new CGI::Simple
      -    add tests to make sure the order of value is kept as they were passed in the QUERY_STRING
      - new co-maintainer (SZABGAB(
