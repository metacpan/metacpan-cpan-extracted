 - Initial Release.
 - QA Tests and travis integration still missing, mostly
   because I can't be bothered dealing with the complexity mountain
   that is DZil anymore, and I need to re-engineer all my travis
   stuff to deal with DZil changes and it all has to stop.
 - So just report bugs when you find them, thanks.
