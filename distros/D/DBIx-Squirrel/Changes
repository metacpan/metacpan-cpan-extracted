Revision history for DBIx-Squirrel

1.2.11  2024-08-18 13:15
        - Fixed typos.
        - Did some internal refactoring.
        - Updated t/lib/T/Constants.pm to ensure that SQLite database connections are created with
          both `sqlite_see_if_its_a_number => !!1` and `sqlite_open_flags => SQLITE_OPEN_READONLY`
          flags and re-ran tests successfully on macOS under Perl 5.28.1. Action was prompted by
          CPAN Tester report confirming Wstat 139 SEGFAULT on BSD under Perl 5.28.1; I have no way
          to replicate this build environment exactly, so I'm hoping this fixes the issue. We shall
          see. Thanks to Chris Williams (BINGOS) for the original report.

        - Did some internal refactoring.
        - Updated dist.ini: no longer using Dist::Zilla Readme plugin to produce README.

          handing-off to &DBI::st::bind_value.
        - No longer quoting hash keys matching /^\w+$/.
