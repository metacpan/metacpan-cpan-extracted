Description: Mouse pointer cursor in widgets
 Gtk2::Ex::WidgetCursor manages the mouse pointer cursor displayed in
 the window of a widget.  It helps widget or application actions
 cooperate with what is normally a write-only resource on the window.
 A global busy is included for easy display of a wristwatch in all
 application windows while number crunching.
