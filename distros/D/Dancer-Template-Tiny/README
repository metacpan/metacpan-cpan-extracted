NAME
    Dancer::Template::Tiny - Template::Tiny backend to Dancer

VERSION
    version 0.03

SYNOPSIS
    This template engine allows you to use Template::Tiny in Dancer.

    Template::Tiny is an implementation of a subset of Template::Toolkit
    (the major parts) which takes much less memory and is faster. If you're
    only using the main functions of Template::Toolkit, you could use
    Template::Tiny. You can also seemlessly move back to Template::Toolkit
    whenver you want.

    You can read more on Template::Tiny.

    To use this engine, all you need to configure in your Dancer's
    "config.yaml":

        template: "tiny"

    Of course, you can also set this while working using "set":

        # code code code
        set template => 'tiny';

    Since Dancer has internal support for a wrapper-like option with the
    "layout" configuration option, you have a WRAPPER like with
    Template::Toolkit even though Template::Tiny doesn't really support it.
    :)

SUBROUTINES/METHODS
  render
    Renders the template. Accepts a string to a file or a reference to a
    string of the template.
