Revision history for AnyEvent-SOCKS-Client

0.051	2.09.2021

	Guard must not trigger c_cb.
	Guard is returned in any non-void context instead of scalar only.

0.05	2.09.2021

	Bugs 139048, 139162, 139160:
	Destruction performed manually before successful c_cb call because of global destructor called only after c_cb termination (may be long-running).
	Useful guard returned - because we may want to cancel connection.

	Proxy input validation and some code re-arrangements.

0.04	28.08.2021

	SOCKS4/4a support

0.03	28.08.2021

	Bug 139048:
	Destructor is properly called now. Removed unnecessary undefs. Likely fixed.

	Bug 139050:
	Added sq. brackets trimming to _parse_uri, likely fixed.

	Feature request 139049:
	Added timeout for initial connection to proxy server.
	Timeout is only used when no prepare_cb passed to proxied function, so you can fine-tune initial connection.

	TYPE_IP4 and TYPE_IP6 in connect_cmd because IP6 doesn't work as FQDN.
	It's only used when host is already valid IP4 or IP6 address (no local DNS resolution).

0.01    08.03.2018
