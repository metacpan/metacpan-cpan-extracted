NAME
    MediaWiki::Bot::Shell - a shell interface to your MediaWiki::Bot

SYNOPSIS
        use MediaWiki::Bot::Shell;

        my $shell = MediaWiki::Bot::Shell->new();
        $shell->cmdloop();

DESCRIPTION
    This provides a shell interface to your MediaWiki::Bot. By initializing
    one or more MediaWiki::Bot objects and using them for the duration of
    your shell session, initialization costs are amortized.

    Configuration data is read from ~/.perlwikibot-shell.rc, or prompted for
    at startup.

    You should probably run "pwb", which is included with this module, to
    enter your shell.

OPTIONS
    Options are passed to the constructor as a hashref. Options are
    currently:

    debug
        Like it says on the tin. Setting debug provides debug output from
        this module, as well as from the underlying MediaWiki::Bot
        object(s).

    norc
        Don't read options from ~/.perlwikibot-shell.rc. This will result in
        the user being prompted for username, password etc.

COMMANDS
  delete
    This will delete a page on the wiki you're currently using:

        delete "Main Page" "for teh lulz"

    To delete a page on another wiki, use [[w:fr:Page Title]]:

        delete "[[w:fr:Page Title]]" "pour les lulz"

    Make sure you quote your input correctly.

  set_wiki
    Switch wikis:

        set_wiki meta.wikimedia.org
        set_wiki secure.wikimedia.org wikipedia/meta/w

  debug
    Turn debugging on or off

        debug on
        debug off

  read
    Read the wikitext of the given page. Remember to quote the page title
    correctly:

        read "Main Page"

  kill
    Lock a cross-wiki vandal's account:

        kill "Some stupid vandal"

  nuke
    The nuclear option: globally lock *and hide* an account:

        nuke "Mike.lifeguard lives at 123 Main St."

  globalblock
    Apply a global block to an IP or CIDR range:

        globalblock 127.0.0.1 --expiry "31 hours"
        globalblock 192.168.0.1 --no-anon-only

   Options:
    --block, --no-block
        Whether to block or unblock the target. Default is to block. When
        unblocking, all settings except "--reason" are ignored.

    --anon-only, --ao
    --no-anon-only, --no-ao
        Whether to block only anonymous users, or all users. Default is to
        hardblock (no-anon-only).

    --reason, --summary
        Sets the block reason.

    --expiry, --length
        Sets the block expiry.

  rollback
    Finds all top edits by the specified user and rolls them back using
    mark-as-bot.

        rollback "Fugly vandal"

    --force
        Override the 10-query limit. Use this when reverting mass vandals
        which have done hundreds of edits. The limit is intended to guard
        against accidentally rolling back edits of an established user.

    Note that this does not (currently) revert page moves, nor delete page
    creations.

SEE ALSO
    pwb, MediaWiki::Bot and the admin plugin.

BUGS
    Yes. This is a proof-of-concept, and there are several issues with both
    MediaWiki::Bot::Plugin::Steward and this module. It should be considered
    pre-alpha. I'm releasing the code so others can find and fix them, in
    the hope that it will be useful for others.

    Please do not report bugs to me without a patch. I have no plans to work
    on this further.
