=head1 NAME

urpme - rpm deinstaller

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    urpme [options] [package_name...]
    urpme [options] --auto-orphans

=head1 DESCRIPTION

urpme allows packages to be deinstalled, including all their dependencies.
I<package_names> must have one of the forms I<name>, I<name-version>,
I<name-version-release>, or I<name-version-release.architecture>. If you
want to specify packages more broadly, use the B<-a> option.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over

=item B<-h>, B<-?>, B<--help>

Prints a help message and exit.

=item B<-a>

If multiple packages match the given substring, deinstall them all.

=item B<-v>, B<--verbose>

Proposes a verbose mode with various messages.

=item B<--auto>

Removes packages non-interactively, without asking questions.

=item B<--auto-orphans>

Removes orphans.

=item B<--test>

Test deinstallation of packages but do not modify the system.

=item B<--force>

Force invocation even if some packages do not exist.

=item B<--justdb>

Update only the database, not the filesystem.

=item B<--noscripts>

Don't execute the scriptlets. This is equivalent to B<rpm --noscripts>.
This can be useful to remove packages where uninstall scriptlets fail for
some reason.

=item B<--parallel> I<alias>

Activate distributed execution of urpmi to other machines (it is mandatory
that urpmi is installed, but it is not necessary to have media defined on
any machines). I<alias> defines which extension module is to be used by
urpmi (currently, urpmi-parallel-ka-run or urpmi-parallel-ssh are
available) and which machines should be updated. This alias is defined in
the file F</etc/urpmi/parallel.cfg> as described below.

=item B<--root> I<directory>

Use the file system tree rooted for rpm install. All operations and
scripts will run after chroot(2). The rpm database that lies in the
rooted tree will be used, but the urpmi configuration comes from the
normal system.

=item B<--urpmi-root> I<directory>

Use the file system tree rooted for urpmi database and rpm install. Contrary
to B<--root>, the urpmi configuration comes from the rooted tree.

=item B<--use-distrib> I<directory>

Configure urpme on the fly from a distribution tree.

=item B<--wait-lock>

If the urpmi or rpm db is busy, wait until it is available

=head1 EXIT CODES

=over

=item C<0>

Success; or nothing was found to remove; or the user cancelled the whole
operation.

=item C<1>

Command line inconsistency, invocation failure (you are not root), or
packages not found.

=item C<2>

Removal of packages failed.
