        Add directory filters for use by applications and subclasses
            Basically, each directory in your path can have a .jifty file
            with config in it. Each file is Hash::Merge'd. This lets your
            app have whatever context you want, based on where you are.
        appname is no longer required
        Add validate_action_args method and have ->act, ->create, etc use it
            if the strict_arguments attribute is true
                idea and proof of concept by John SJ Anderson

        Removed canonicalize_action and canonicalize_model
        Allow search arguments to be arrayrefs, to facilitate using hashes for
            them. e.g: 'id => [1, 5]' is equivalent to 'id => 1, id => 5'
