    - Don't check STDERR on pager error.
        Something's off in checking STDERR when running an external
        pager. Could be race condition? Anyway, we only care about
        propagation of the exit status, so just test that.

        Tests work in my dev. environment, but fail about 30-50% of
        the time on CPAN testers.

    - Use custom script for pager error exit.
        Running external commands in tests is not as easy
        as it seems...

  [Features]

    - Allow empty "pager" (dump to STDOUT)
        Instead of falling back to "cat", fall back to
        raw STDOUT printing. An empty pager list will
        select STDOUT as well.

      message instead.
