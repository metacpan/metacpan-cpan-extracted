	RR.pm ver 0.06, small documentation update

	Thanks to "Clayton O'Neill" <coneill@oneill.net> for spotting this
	one. Fixed bug in dn_comp which only seems to manifest when you pass in
	a name that begins with a number.  Sometimes it seems that if perl has
	evaluated the scalar in a numeric context for some reason, it's type
	will be considered to be IV, not PV.  The patch I've attached changes
	the check to see if it's a glob first, and if not, checks to see if it
	can be used as a PV, instead of checking if it is already a PV.

	i.e. ::nnn... ...nnn:: 	instead of starting or ending with
