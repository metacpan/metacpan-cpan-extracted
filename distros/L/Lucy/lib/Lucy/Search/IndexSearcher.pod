=head1 NAME

Lucy::Search::IndexSearcher - Execute searches against a single index.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $searcher = Lucy::Search::IndexSearcher->new( 
        index => '/path/to/index' 
    );
    my $hits = $searcher->hits(
        query      => 'foo bar',
        offset     => 0,
        num_wanted => 100,
    );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Use the IndexSearcher class to perform search queries against an index.
(For searching multiple indexes at once, see
L<PolySearcher|Lucy::Search::PolySearcher>).

IndexSearchers operate against a single point-in-time view or
L<Snapshot|Lucy::Index::Snapshot> of the index.  If an index is
modified, a new IndexSearcher must be opened to access the changes.
