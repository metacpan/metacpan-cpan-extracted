      1. Overview

         WebTools was projected to reduce maximum development work in web 
      projects! It decide most of common tasks, so you can think about more 
      important things at all. Note that, this package is not 10-15 kb and you 
      will need a time to learn everything about it. But don't afraid to start. 
      I am sure that it will be helpful for you :-) 
       This document is not a comprehensive help. It is reference! For more 
      information and help please see examples into docs directory!



      2. Web Tools 
         This module capsulate most of functionally that Web developer need for 
      its projects! 
      Mainly is support: sessions, user accounts, html-perl code (php like), 
      Database support, templates and more.. 
        
      Exported Variables


      *SESSIONSTDOUT 
         Standard OUTput handler used by webtools to emulate PRINT-like 
      operators. 

      %SESREG 
         This hash contain all registered variables with "this" session. 

      %SIGNALS 
         This hash contained all catched signals from user's script. 

      %sess_cookies 
         Contain all cookies received from input stream. 

      %uploaded_files 
           Contain filenames of all uploaded files via multipart form! 
           They are names of files on local machine (i.e. your web server) 
           You can open and read these files from your server's tmp directory! 
           Note that you must to clean up by yourself (please delete these files 
      after your job)  

      $cpg_priority
           Show priority of cookies and get/post global variables. This variable 
      can
           contain 'cookie' (cookies has higher priority) or 'get/post' 
(get/post
           variables rewrite cookies values)

      $sentcontent 
         Show whether Send_Content() where called! (i.e. data were flushed to 
      browser) 

      $ip_restrict_mode 
         Set 'on' or 'off' restriction of session by IP 

      $apacheshtdocs 
         This is apache`s htdocs directory. 

      $reg_buffer 
         Contain registered session data!

      $cookie_domain_cgi 
         That is DOMAIN added to cookies (e.g: .july.bg) 

      $cookie_exp_date_cgi 
         That is DATE added to cookies 

      $secure_cookie_cgi 
         That is SECURE atribute added to cookies (e.g: 1 or 0) 

      $session_started 
         Show whether session_start were started! 

      $print_header_buffer 
         Here is a place where script holds 'headers' (only!) 

      $print_flush_buffer 
         Here is a place where script holds 'body'!

      $cgi_script_timeout 
         That is a expiration time of script i.e. maximum running time of 
      script. Default it's value is 120 seconds! If you  need more time for your 
      script, please don't change that var directly, please use function 
      set_script_timeout()  If you thing you need more time for all your scripts 
      at all, then change this var (it is found into config.pl) 

      $cgi_lib_forbid_mulipart 
         If you want to protect yourself from multipart spam turn this to 'on' 
      (Default it is set to 'off')
         If you disable this variable you will not longer receive Multipart 
      forms via POST!

      set_variables_dump
           That function force dump of get/post, cookies, session variables 
           and uploaded files at the end of result html page. If you want to use
           this feature call this function wherever you want before end of 
      script.
           Call function with parameter '1' if you want to use this feature or 
      '0' 
           to turn it off!
           Note: However, you also need to be in debug mode (see config.pl)
           before this feature to be useful!
           Second parameter is debug style view, it can take
           follow values: 'html', 'popup' and 'layer'. Try it!
           set_variables_dump (1,'popup'); 

      r_str

      ________________________________________________ 
        
      SignUpUser 
         $res = SignUpUser ($user,$pass,$data,$dbh); 
         $res can be 1 - success and 0 - :-(
         $data is user's data that you may whant to save into database. You can 
      save there up to 1MB!

      SignInUser 
         ($ID,$DATA) = SignInUser ($user,$pass,$dbh); 
         $ID is Id on user 
         $DATA is custom data on same user fetched from DB! 
      ________________________________________________ 

      *  SIGNALS IN WEBTOOLS


         That module support base signals from Unix/Linux and couple customs.
        So you can handle follow SIGs: 
        
      'OnFlush'  - That event will happened when script prepare to print all 
      data (Header and Body). 
      'OnError'  - That event will happened when some internal script error 
      appear. 
      'OnExit'  - That event will happened when script exit. 
      'OnTerm'  - You can use this event when connection between server and 
      browser has been broken (used signals: TERM,STOP,PIPE) 
      'OnTimeOut' - This event will happened when your scripts lifetime is down 
      (Default it is 120 seconds) (used signal is: ALRM) 
      To use these events you must initialize global hash %SIGNALS whit proper 
      reference to sub. 

      Example: 
       $SIGNALS{'OnTimeOut'} = \&MyDefaultTimeOutSubroutine; 
        sub MyDefaultTimeOutSubroutine { print "Timeout!!!"; } 
      Note: All events are case-sensitive!


      *  What libraries are currently loaded?

      That can be difficult question and some time you may need to reUSE or to 
      reREQUIRE some library. However I decide to introduce simple mechanism 
      solving that problem. Every library (or almost anyone) have unique number 
      that exist if given module were loaded. 
      Number - Library: 
      1 - Database driver for MySQL (db_mysql.pl)
      2 - Database driver for MS Access (db_access.pl)
      4 - Database driver for Flat files (db_flat.pl)
      8 - Xreader (xreader.pl)
      16 - Flat support for Sessions (sess_flat.pl)
      32 - Miscellaneous tools (tools.pl)
      64 - Mail library (mail.pl)
      128 - Simple functions for coding/encoding (utl.pl)
      256 - Download library (downloader.pl)
      512 - Php simulation library (php.pl)
      1024 - Simple fork library (fork.pl)
      2048 - Sub set of JavaScript functions (JavaScript.pl) 
      If you want to find out whether some library is already loaded in WebTools 
      (this can speed up all execution process) you can check respective library 
      on that way: 
       if (!($webtools::loaded_functions & 8)) {eval "require 'xreader.pl'";} 
      Follow code will load "xreader.pl" library when it has not been loaded 
yet.
      Please use this format with require syntax to prevent double loading of 
      respective library! 
        
      3. GlobExport 
       This module is used indirect from scripts (included by webtools.pm). It 
      parses input data from form (POST), from GET and from Cookies. All input 
      data are exports to global variables! 
       There aren't support functions for this module (constructor and 
      destructor are automatically called). 
        
      4. STDoutHandle 
       This module catch standard output (STDOUT) and printed data are buffered 
      on default. 
        
      5. XReader 
      This module is very cool its supply possibility of script to use extern 
      templates (html code and SQL inline) 
           That function read from file HTML data (with some 
         futures) and substitute SQL queries and vars with 
         respective values! 
         $scalar = xreader($N_of_part,$filename); 
      For more information see docs/examples/Lesson-8-xreader, but first read 
      Templates lesson in docs/templates ! 
        
      6. Config.pl

      # file with extension ordered in @treat_htmls_ext array 
      # If you leave this array empty then no lookups will be made! 
      # Order of below array is really important! 
      # Example: 
      # If your real file is: env.cgi and you want script to

      7. Security and restrictions 

       If you have been completed read install.html document you probably 
      already mentioned most security problems in CGI world, so one of all main 
      targets are security and restrictions. 
       First of all I want to insure you, that WebTools capture most of CGI 
      security holes. 
        
      *  Safely running of perl/html scripts: 
         Main script "process.cgi" should run other scripts like "env.html" , so 
      only way to do it, is using of "file" variable in follow format: 
       http://your_server/cgi-bin/your_webtools/process.cgi?file=some_script, 
      where some_script can be located in your "htmls" directory! So it is 
      extremely important to set your default "htmls" directory (in config.pl) 
      with care (e.g.: /home/my_domain/my_web/cgi-bin/my_webtools/htmls/) or 
      (./htmls/ where your current directory is "webtools" directory).


      WebTools will care about security problems with script called like this: 
      http://your_server/cgi-bin/your_webtools/process.cgi?file=/etc/passwd


      To prevent security problems, you should follow next rules: 
      -         Never leave anyone directory variable empty! (like 'htmls', 
      'db', 'tmp'&#8230;) 
      -         Never set in these variable ROOT directory. 


      No body can write in URL locater (in browser) query like that: 
      http://your_server/cgi-bin/your_webtools/process.cgi?file=../some_script 
      You are protected for any kind of FILE crack actions like: 
      -         ".." one directory down 
      -         "." Current directory 
      -         "/" or "\" Root directory 
      -         "~" Home directory 
      -         Also you have protected from any "illegal" characters in your 
      query!


      However you can use queries like: 
      &#8230;/process.cgi?file=/some_local_dir/some_script 
      where  /some_local_dir/ is directory in your "default htmls" directory. 
      For example that could be: /home/my_htmls/some_local_dir/  

      So I hope that you are understood how important is not keeping of "htmls" 
      directory empty or ROOT!!! 
        
      Also via "file=" variable in query line you CAN'T call scripts with 
      whatever you want extension! Only acceptable are: whtml html htm cgihtml 
      and cgi 

      Please notice that all these files are WEBTOOLS files (HTML plus Perl :-) 
      )! 
        
      * FLOOD protection: 
         Principle WebTools haven't FLOOD protections but you should know that 
      all multipart data (I mean uploads) are saved in your TMP directory and if 
      you don't know about them, after end of your script WebTools will 
      automatically delete all of them!

         Also you have POST limit size. i.e. you can't accept more data that 
      specified in confg.pl file ($cgi_lib_maxdata default is 4 MB) 
        
      *  TIME protection: 
         If your script stop to respond (for example stay in infinitive loop) or 
      wait forever for some event WebTools will "kill" your script immediately 
      after lifetime specified in config.pl ($cgi_script_timeout default 120 
      seconds)


      To change that time please use set_script_timeout($timeout) function. 

      To capture event "OnTimeOut" please set follow handler: 
      $SIGNALS{'OnTimeOut'} = \&your_sub; 
        
      *  IP restrictions: 
         If you write web based application for small community you may want to 
      keep out external web visitors from your site?!? Now you can protect all 
      your WebTools based applications from external visitors based on IP 
      restriction. To switch this feature on, you need to fill out db/ips.pl 
      file with IPs that match your needs. Currently all IPs are allowed to run 
      your scripts! Please edit or delete lines that not match your protection 
      policy! 
        
      *  Session restriction based on IP 
         If you use sessions you may want to protect your sessions by IP i.e. 
      one opened session can be used only by PC, created that session! 


      Note: If your visitors use proxy to access your scripts you may need to 
      switch this feature off (Use follow syntax: session_ip_restrict('off'); )


      Also you should know that scripts are never restricted by IP if you use 
      forced flat file session support! (See config.pl and $sess_force_flat) 
        
         All functions and WebTools itself are released to help and to protect 
      all of us, BUT you should realize that we are not GODs and you will take 
      all responsibility of WebTools actions on your server and on all world 
      wide! Please keep that in your mind. 
      PLEASE SEND ALL SECURITY PROBLEMS THAT YOU MET IN YOUR PRACTICE WITH 
      WebTools at julian@proscrptum.com 
      Thank's 
        
      8. Various stuff

         That section regards various questions.

        1. Highlighting for UltraEdit text editor. 
         If you want to have feature of highlighting with UltraEdit please open 
      your docs/WORDFILE.TXT 
      Now go to your UltraEdit directory and open WORDFILE.TXT and add to this 
      file a contain of docs/WORDFILE.TXT file!
      Edit follow line: 
      /L7"WebTools" .... 
      you may need to change number of language supprt (default is 7: /L7....). 
      Save changes of UltraEdit wordfile. Now UltraEdit will highlight files 
      with extensions: whtml and cgihtml :-)
