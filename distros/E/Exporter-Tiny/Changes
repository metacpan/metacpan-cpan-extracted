1.004003	2022-09-30

 [ Bug Fixes ]
 - If exporting non-CODE items which happen to have the same name as

   exports should now work.

 - Using ! with a tag now works; it was previously documented as working
   but not implemented.

1.003_001	2022-07-21

1.002002	2020-04-24

 [ Bug Fixes ]
 - Bug in handling regexps in import lists; Exporter::Tiny allowed regexps
   like /foo/i but not /foo/. Having trailing flags is now optional!
   Tomohiro Hosaka++
   <https://github.com/tobyink/p5-exporter-tiny/issues/6>
 - Tests would fail if `PERL5OPT=-Mfeature=:5.18` environment variable was
   set. This is because bareword `-default` was being interpreted as the
   Perl `default` keyword.
