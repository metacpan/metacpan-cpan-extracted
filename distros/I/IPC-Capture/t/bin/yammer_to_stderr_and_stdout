yammer_to_stderr_and_stdout - yammers to stderr and stdout


=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<yammer_to_stderr_and_stdout> is a script which sends a known
quantity of output to stdout and stderr, so that a test
script can run it and check it's ability to capture either
of them.

Specifically, it outputs the following dozen lines,
the lines marked (O) go to STDOUT, the lines marekd <e>
go to STDERR:

1: (O): hello out there
1: <e>: hello err there
2: (O): hello out there
2: <e>: hello err there
3: (O): hello out there
3: <e>: hello err there
4: (O): hello out there
4: <e>: hello err there
5: (O): hello out there
5: <e>: hello err there
6: (O): hello out there
6: <e>: hello err there
