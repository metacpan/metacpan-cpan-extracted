    $Id: Changes 560 2006-07-17 16:52:16Z me $

0.0.2.12 Jun 06 2008
       - no code changes
       - has a POD coverage test (skipped, but has one)
       - you know, gotta please CPANTS

0.0.2.11 Jul 20 2007
       - search.cpan and Module::Build are not ready yet
         for artistic2 (even though CPAN is) - back to 
         Perl licenses
       - Damn! 5.9.5 keeps warning about "v-string in use/require non-portable"
         because Roman 1.20 uses "use 5.6.0"

0.0.2.10 Jul 20 2007
       - "license => 'mit'" slipped instead of "license => 'artistic2'"

0.0.2.9  Jul 20 2007
       - make sure only uppercase (I, II, X) is accepted
         and no lowercase Roman numerals: ii, x, vi
       - the example (eg/roman.pl) was broken into three
         files
       - license update to Artistic 2.0
       - added 'configure_requires' to META.yml

0.0.2  Jun 29 2007
       - I + 'II' is alright
       - def_prototypes gets twice as fast using set_prototype
         (from Scalar::Util) rather than eval STRING
       - example at eg/roman.pl

0.0.1  Jun 28 2007
       - First unreleased version.

       TODO:
       + Acme::Roman::AUTOLOAD - declares Acme::Roman::XX, etc.
       + imported AUTOLOAD - exports XX, etc.
       + document in "begin private"
       + pass "t/98_pod-coverage.t"
       + POD in example files
