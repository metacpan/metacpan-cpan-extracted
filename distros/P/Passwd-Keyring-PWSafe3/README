NAME

    Passwd::Keyring::PWSafe3 - Password storage based on Password Safe
    encrypted files

VERSION

    Version 0.61

SYNOPSIS

    Password Safe implementation of Passwd::Keyring. Passwords are stored
    in the Password Safe <http://passwordsafe.sourceforge.net> encrypted
    file.

        use Passwd::Keyring::PWSafe3;
    
        my $keyring = Passwd::Keyring::PWSafe3->new(
             app=>"blahblah scraper",
             group=>"Johnny web scrapers",
             file=>"/home/joe/secrets.pwsafe3",        # ~/passwd-keyring.pwsafe3 by default
             master_password=>"very secret password",  # Or callback. See below
        );
    
        my $username = "John";  # or get from .ini, or from .argv...
    
        my $password = $keyring->get_password($username, "blahblah.com");
        unless( $password ) {
            $password = <somehow interactively prompt for password>;
    
            # securely save password for future use
            $keyring->set_password($username, $password, "blahblah.com");
        }
    
        login_somewhere_using($username, $password);
        if( password_was_wrong ) {
            $keyring->clear_password($username, "blahblah.com");
        }

DESCRIPTION

    This module does not require Password Safe to be installed, and can be
    used as generic "store many passwords in file encrypted with single
    master password" storage. Password Safe GUI, if installed, may help the
    user to review, modify, or delete saved passwords.

      Official GUIs can be freely downloaded from the official site
      <http://passwordsafe.sourceforge.net> - both Windows and (beta) Linux
      versions are available. Apart from them there exist various
      compatible tools
      <http://passwordsafe.sourceforge.net/relatedprojects.shtml>, for
      example <Pasaffe for Gnome|https://launchpad.net/pasaffe> or <PwSafe
      for Mac|http://passwordsafe.sourceforge.net/relatedprojects.shtml>.

    Actual handling of Password Safe format is based on Crypt::PWSafe3
    module. Passwd::Keyring::PWSafe3 just wraps it into the interface
    compatible with other Passwd::Keyring backends.

    See Passwd::Keyring::Auto::KeyringAPI for detailed comments on keyring
    methods (this document is installed with Passwd::Keyring::Auto
    package).

CAVEATS

    Underlying module (Crypt::PWSafe3) in fact rewrites the whole file on
    every save and keeps all passwords cached in memory while active. This
    means, that any attempts to use the file paralelly from a few programs,
    or from a few objects within one program, are doomed to cause lost
    updates. Also, all passwords from the file are kept in (unprotected)
    memory while keyring object is active. Therefore, it is recommended to
    use separate .psafe3 file for Passwd::Keyring::PWSafe3, not mixing it
    with normal Password Safe database, and to keep keyring object for a
    short time only, especially if modifications happen.

    There are some limitations in Crypt::PWSafe3 handling of Password Safe
    format. Passwords are read and saved properly and it is possible to
    alternate using them from perl, and via Password Safe GUI, but some
    less important aspects of the format, like password expiraton policy,
    may be ignored. Refer to Crypt::PWSafe3 docs for more details.

DATA MAPPING

    Group name is mapped to Password Safe folder.

    Realm is mapped as password title.

    Username and password are ... well, used as username and password.

SUBROUTINES/METHODS

 new(app=>'app name', group=>'passwords folder', file=>'pwsafe3 file',
 master_password=>'secret or callback', lazy_save=>1)

    Initializes the processing. Croaks if Crypt::PWSafe3 is not installed
    or master password is invalid. May create password file if it is
    missing.

    Handled parameters:

    app

      Symbolic application name (used in password notes)

    group

      Name for the password group (used as folder name)

    file

      Location of .pwsafe3 file. If not given, passwd-keyring.pwsafe3 in
      user home directory is used. Will be created if does not exist. Note:
      absolute path is required, relative paths are very error prone.

    master_password

      Password required to unlock the file. Can be given as string, or as
      callback returning a string (usually some way of interactively asking
      user for the password). The callback gets two parameters: app and
      file.

      If this param is missing, module will prompt interactively for this
      password using console prompt.

    lazy_save

      if given, asks not to save the file after every change (saving is
      fairly time consuming), but only when $keyring->save is called or
      when keyring is destroyed.

    Note: it of course does not make much sense to keep app passwords in
    encrypted storage if master password is saved in plain text. The module
    most natural usage is to interactively ask for master password (and use
    it to protect noticeable number of application-specific passwords).

    Ideas of how to workaround this obstacle are welcome. I loosely
    consider either caching master password per desktop session
    (implementing sht. similar to ssh-agent/gpg-agent or using one of those
    somehow), or integrating the tool with PAM to use actual system
    password, or both - but while it seems doable on Linux, cross platform
    solution is not so easy.

 set_password(username, password, realm)

    Sets (stores) password identified by given realm for given user

 get_password($user_name, $realm)

    Reads previously stored password for given user in given app. If such
    password can not be found, returns undef.

 clear_password($user_name, $realm)

    Removes given password (if present)

 save

    Saves unsaved changes, if any are present.

    Important only when lazy_save was given in constructor.

 is_persistent

    Returns info, whether this keyring actually saves passwords
    persistently.

    (true in this case)
