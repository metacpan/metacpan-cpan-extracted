=head1 NAME

Lucy::Search::LeafQuery - Leaf node in a tree created by QueryParser.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    package MyQueryParser;
    use base qw( Lucy::Search::QueryParser );

    sub expand_leaf {
        my ( $self, $leaf_query ) = @_;
        if ( $leaf_query->get_text =~ /.\*\s*$/ ) {
            return PrefixQuery->new(
                query_string => $leaf_query->get_text,
                field        => $leaf_query->get_field,
            );
        }
        else {
            return $self->SUPER::expand_leaf($leaf_query);
        }
    }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

LeafQuery objects serve as leaf nodes in the tree structure generated by
L<QueryParser|Lucy::Search::QueryParser>’s L<tree()|Lucy::Search::QueryParser/tree> method.
Ultimately, they must be transformed, typically into either
L<TermQuery|Lucy::Search::TermQuery> or
L<PhraseQuery|Lucy::Search::PhraseQuery> objects, as attempting to
search a LeafQuery causes an error.

=head1 CONSTRUCTORS

=head2 new

    my $leaf_query = Lucy::Search::LeafQuery->new(
        text  => '"three blind mice"',    # required
        field => 'content',               # default: undef
    );

Create a new LeafQuery.
