Revision history for Perl extension Module::Build::Convert.

0.49 Wed Aug 15 23:17:25 CEST 2007

 - Merged development version to stable.

 - Fixed _parse_data(), which previously died with a warning (due to an
   attempt to modify an unmodifiable array) when run in batch-mode.
   The root of the cause was re-reading (slurping) from the <DATA> handle,
   which after the second iteration silently skipped over to read
   from the beginning of __END__ until EOF - ergo, no appropriate
   chunks were generated.

 - Removed 'my' occurences within the SYNOPSIS part of the documentation.

 - Beautified documentation (added code tags for options to new()).

 - Unmarked the -p switch (PPI mode) within make2build as experimental.

0.48_02 Sat Apr  7 20:25:43 CEST 2007

 - Fixed some pathological case where an empty @items was
   being finalized in _parse_makefile_ppi().

0.48_01 Wed Apr  4 23:22:04 CEST 2007

 - Took an approach at implementing a PPI-based parser;
   the drawbacks are, that comments aren't currently parsed
   and the debugging mode is still unavailable.

0.48 Mon Mar 12 10:08:45 CET 2007

 - Merged development version to stable.

0.47_07 Tue Mar  6 09:21:07 CET 2007

 - Corrected the spelling of the mistakenly lower-case written
   configuration option "Use_Native_Ordering" within make2build.

 - Ensured that de- or re-quoted arguments have a trailing comma.
   The last argument within multiple arguments remains without a
   comma.

 - Code statements as arguments within the arguments list are
   properly dequoted. Furthermore, "complex" constructs consisting
   of variables intermixed with static data are double-quoted.

0.47_06 Sat Mar  3 14:43:00 CET 2007

 - A greedy match was the cause that the ampersand (&) wasn't removed
   from &WriteMakefile(). The regular expression has been adjusted.

 - Instead of deleting all single- & doublequotes in $value within 
   _parse_process_string(), now only leading and trailing quotes are 
   being removed.

 - Comments to be removed from the parsing string are now being
   properly escaped. The substitution in _parse_process_code() 
   was previously broken.

 - Integrated negative zero-width look-ahead assertion in the regular
   expression matching strings within _parse_makefile().

 - MakeMaker's MY:: subs are now being removed. The strings are
   fetched by _extract_sub().

 - Included the documentation of the -c switch in make2build.

0.47_05 Sun Feb 18 02:37:05 CET 2007

 - Comments "attached" to an argument and loose comments are properly
   processed.

 - Code chunks and variables are now being handled by Text::Balanced's
   extract_codeblock() and extract_variable().

 - A new configuration option has been introduced: 'Process_Code'.
   Processing "code" may be invoked via the -c parameter of make2build.

0.47_04 Wed Feb 14 00:28:41 CET 2007

 - In _debug_array_text() an attempt was made to dereference a non-
   reference. Changed variable content to reflect actual array reference.

0.47_03 Sun Feb 11 03:15:40 CET 2007

 - Moved large parts of the Makefile parser to external subroutines.

 - Deprecated use of inserting unknown Makefile chunks to the data
   structure and hence to the Build.PL generated. The according 
   subroutines haven't been removed, solely uncommented.

 - "Re-executing" the parser when processing multiple directories
   unleashed some malfunctionality: the current directory, that
   should be reprocessed was silently skipped, because we were
   shifting the directory array and didn't unshift but push the
   directory, which worked for a single directory, but not for
   multiples. Furthermore, re-displaying the list with pending
   items was surpressed in order to not confuse the user.

0.47_02 Sun Feb  4 18:04:04 CET 2007

 - Replaced deprecated defined() behaviour on dereferenced array
   references with anonymous array references alternations.

 - Use IO::Prompt::prompt() for prompting. Added as prerequisite.

0.47_01 Wed Jan 24 22:48:24 CET 2007

 - Tiny refactoring of convert().

 - IO::File->new invocations have now a separate mode argument.

 - _exists_overwrite()'s visual output has been improved.

0.47 Sun Jan 21 17:25:58 CET 2007

 - Accidentally used bare print instead of _do_verbose()
   within _show_summary().

0.46 Sun Jan 21 16:59:04 CET 2007

 - Replaced calls to warn within _makefile_ok() with print.

 - Merged redundant code in _show_summary() to a few simpler
   statements; furthermore, replaced multiple print statements
   with string concatenation.

0.45 Thu Jan 18 09:58:17 CET 2007

 - The debugging mode has been accidentally borked. Restored
   _debug() method from 0.41 which doesn't emit any warnings.

 - Fixed relevant code to _show_summary() to correctly output
   the method chosen (parse/execute).

 - Enhanced string match regular expression in _parse_makefile()
   to allow for embedded parentheses.

0.44 Sat Nov 18 20:01:50 CET 2006

 - Added whitespace where necessary.

 - make2build accepts the specification of the Makefile.PL
   filename as commandline argument. [Mario Iseli, admin@marioiseli.com]

0.43 Mon Nov 13 00:27:16 CET 2006

 - Commandline switch -x has become -e.

 - Replaced broken tabs with regular spaces within multiple files.

0.42 Thu Oct 12 15:22:53 CEST 2006

 - Fixed a missing semicolon which is now the trailing end
   of the substituted prompt()/Verbose() functions.

0.41 Tue Oct 10 21:04:54 CEST 2006

 - The Makefile.PL has been unintentional excluded from the
   tarball written which is fixed now.

0.40 Tue Oct 10 18:15:37 CEST 2006

 - prompt()/Verbose() within the input code read from Makefile.PL
   are while converting substituted by Module::Build equivalents.
   [Claes Jakobsson, claes@surfar.nu]

0.39 Fri Oct  6 20:29:03 CEST 2006

 - Occurences of the functions prompt()/Verbose() which are
   exported by ExtUtils::MakeMaker by default are removed
   from the code written to the Build.PL.

0.38 Wed Sep 27 08:45:11 CEST 2006

 - Fixed some minor bug which caused an exit while the
   execution mode was being launched.

0.37 Tue Sep 26 20:58:04 CEST 2006

 - Fixed a few lines broken indentation.

0.36 Tue Sep 26 16:01:19 CEST 2006

 - Should a Build.PL already exist and if we're asked whether
   we want to override it and answer no, the next distribution
   is handled within the queue.

 - The summary does also list which distributions have been
   intentionally skipped.

0.35 Tue Sep 26 08:52:34 CEST 2006

 - If we're automatically processing multiple distributions
   and the verbose mode has been activated, a summary will be
   output when converting has come to an end. The summary lists
   which distributions were successfully processed (or not) and
   whether they've been parsed or executed.

 - Made the paths to Makefile.PL, Build.PL and MANIFEST
   absolute to avoid misleading paths when not in the directory
   that has been passed as argument to make2build.

 - Adjusted the debugging output to be shown for all parseable
   distributions contained within the path that has been specified
   via make2build.

0.34 Sun Sep 24 13:01:42 CEST 2006

 - Module::Build::Convert is now capable of doing the conversion
   automatically for all modules within a certain directory with
   make2build being only called once with the relative/absolute
   path to the top-level directory provided.

 - The initial converting message showing which paths have been
   gathered for the Build.PL & Makefile.PL has been relocated
   in order to appear before the method _exists() is being called.
   Increases visual overview regarding which module is being
   currently processed largely.

0.33 Fri Sep 22 16:43:04 CEST 2006

 - Optimized the method _exists() to output a newline in verbose
   mode after being asked whether one wants to override an existing
   Build.PL.

 - Prohibited the method _exists() to be twice called when we reinit
   the conversion.

 - Verbose output statements contain three leading stars (***).

 - The output generated when while parsing a code bit is found,
   is now embedded within a here-doc.

 - The string parsing regular expression has been improved to
   recognize mail adresses within <>.

 - Extended the code parsing regular expression for comments.

0.32 Thu Sep 21 21:32:27 CEST 2006

 - Improved the debugging visual output for the parsing process.
   Removed the usage of *empty* for missing values.

 - "Press [enter] to continue" will be displayed after each string,
   array or hash processed.

0.31 Thu Sep 21 13:49:07 CEST 2006

 - Modified the string parsing regular expression to not match
   whenever a { or [ appears within the current bit that's parsed.

 - The debugging output is now contained within here-docs.

 - Added '' / [] / {} to the appropriate debugging descriptions 
  (string, array and hash).

 - While parsing, empty values of either a string, array or hash 
   will be substituted with *empty*.

 - Extended the _exists() method to ask whether the Build.PL
   should be overwritten in case the option "Dont_Overwrite_Auto"
   is activated; will continue normally if disabled.

 - The initial note created by Module::Build::Compat will be
   munged.

0.30 Sat Jun 17 21:39:33 CEST 2006

 - Extended t/convert.t to mark defaulted arguments to be inserted
   as such.

0.29 Thu May  4 22:52:46 CEST 2006

 - Added $class variable to constructor new() which is filled with
   the dereferenced $self if $self is a ref or solely $self otherwise.

0.28 Wed Apr 26 22:08:27 CEST 2006

 - Added method _exists() which conditionally checks for a preexisting
   Build.PL and will warn & exit (die) if it finds one. May be disabled
   by supplying the argument 'Dont_Overwrite' with a negative value to
   the object constructor new().

 - The status message output in the method _makefile_ok() when a Build.PL
   is missing has been simplified to appreciate absolute paths correctly.

0.27 Thu Apr 20 17:17:59 CEST 2006

 - Included convert.t which has been previously (v.0.26) omitted.

0.26 Thu Apr 20 00:22:46 CEST 2006

 - The test suite has been extented to include convert.t which
   tests for a basic makeargs conversion with all currently enlisted
   arguments in the conversion table. The won thereof build args are
   also subject to sane type [SCALAR, ARRAY, HASH] detection.

0.25_01 Tue Feb 21 00:51:57 CET 2006

 - The regular expressions of importance to the parsing process
   have been visually reformatted with the /x modifier to be more
   readable & fit in nicely to separate strings - use is made
   thereof for string, array and hash detection.

0.25 Tue Feb 14 17:33:46 CET 2006

 - The create_makefile_pl default argument has been changed from
   creating a passthrough Makefile.PL to write a traditional style
   Makefile.PL instead.

 - $self->{Config}{reloaded} renamed to $self->{Config}{reinit}.

0.24 Sun Jan 29 21:49:32 CET 2006

 - If parsing the Makefile.PL doesn't succeed entirely and
   the 'process' starts looping endlessly, the "execute the
   Makefile.PL" mode - available via commandline switch or
   parameter to new() - will be activated by setting the according
   $self->{Config}{} flag and jumping back to convert() will run
   the complete converting procedure again.

 - _compose_header() adds the use (strict|warnings);
   pragmas, which are defined hardcoded for now, to the top of
   the Build.PL written after having ensured that no previous
   occurences of these pragmas could be found in the Makefile.PL.

0.22 Tue Nov 15 12:29:09 CET 2005

 - The default arguments 'build_requires', 'recommends' and
   'conflicts' are excluded from being written to Build.PL
   by default.

0.21_01 Thu Nov 3 21:54:29 CET 2005

 - _compose_header() has been made more consistent in adding
   newlines in an adequate manner to the header composed.

0.21 Tue Nov 1 21:42:10 CET 2005

 - Moved the package Make::Build::Convert to the namespace
   Module::Build to disambiguate its uses.

0.20_07 Sun Oct 30 18:10:09 CET 2005

 - To avoid that global scalars are "polluted" by running
   "do 'Makefile.PL'", they're copied by _save_globals() and
   restored through _restore_globals().

0.20_05 Thu Oct 27 20:36:47 CEST 2005

 - Polished some of the parsing code up to the extent that
   it is able to recognize and process standalone comments properly.

 - A trailing comment of a MakeMaker argument entry is appended
   to the Module::Build equivalent for all type variants.

 - Some unnecessary newlines are removed while composing
   the header of a Build.PL.

0.20_04 Sun Oct 23 14:51:30 CEST 2005

 - _compose_header() rearranges the placement of the shebang,
   line, comments, use/require statements should they appear
   within the Makefile.PL in order to fit in nicely with the
   default Build.PL code. The use/require ExtUtils::MakeMaker
   statement will be removed as it becomes unneeded.

0.20_03 2005/10/21

 - Statically parsing the Makefile.PL as the method to
   "receive" MakeMaker arguments, supersedes the previous
   known "do 'Makefile.PL'" evaluation.

 - _parse_args() has been added that acts as de-facto
   replacement of _run_makefile() . Scalar, array and hash
   arguments will be extracted by parsing the Makefile
   string; code chunks are processed in a separate branch.

 - A warning is emitted if WriteMakefile() takes indirect
   arguments via a hash.

0.20_02 2005/10/18

 - The necessary subs to write and parse the contents of a
   RC-file have been added.

 - Further MakeMaker arguments to be converted includes
   the Module::Build equivalents: PL_files, pm_files,
   pod_files, xs_files, include_dirs, meta_add.

 - Usage and version output in make2build is being embedded
   to subs.

 - The unintentional space preceeding filenames in MANIFEST
   issue has been resolved.

0.20 2005/10/15

 - Conversion from script to object-oriented module.

0.19 2005/10/13

 - The obligatory usage screen and according switches have
   been introduced.

 - The verbosity output has been extended to mention the
   overriding of arguments and arguments that are classified
   as unknown to the user while conversion is in charge.

 - sort_args() is able to distinguish whether the native
   sorting order should be preserved or the default one
   used instead.

 - do_verbose() outputs based on verbosity levels.

0.18_02 2005/10/12

 - Test failures have been fixed.

 - The code chunk that cleaned args of unneeded whitespace
   has been replaced with a ?{} construct.

 - Commas are added to enclosing brackets.

0.18 2005/09/28

 - The conversion & interpretation of arguments which
   specify temporary files for removement has been implemented.
   [Nathan Gray, kolibrie@graystudios.org]

 - Array argument conversion has been integrated with included
   string to elements conversion, when necessary.

0.17 2005/03/07

 - Added recommends, build_requires, conflicts, pm_files,
   extra_compiler_flags, sign, dist_abstract, dist_author
   to conversion table.

0.16 2005/03/06

 - A notice is placed in the created Build.PL, indicating
   that it was created by make2build.

0.12 2004/02/23

 - ExtUtils::MakeMaker arguments DISTNAME, VERSION, VERSION_FROM,
   are converted and output sorted.

 - Default value of the license argument has been replaced
   with 'unknown'.

0.11 2004/02/22

 - Documentation has been largely extended.

0.07 2004/02/19

 - Redundant, unneeded code removed.

0.01 2004/02/09

 - Initial version.
