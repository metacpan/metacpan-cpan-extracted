INTRODUCTION:

Inline::Java - Write Perl classes in Java.

Inline::Java lets you write Perl classes in Java.

Example:

    use Inline Java => <<'END';
        class JAxH {
            public JAxH(String x){
                System.out.println("Just Another " + x + " Hacker") ;
            }
        }
    END
    
    new JAxH('Inline') ;

When run, this complete program prints:

    Just Another Inline Hacker


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
JNI (JAVA NATIVE INTERFACE) EXTENSION:

Inline::Java now provides a JNI extension that allows you to load the Java 
virtual machine as shared object instead of running it as a separate process. 

See README.JNI for more information on building the JNI extension.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
INSTALLATION:

- This module requires Inline version 0.44 or higher to be installed.
- It also requires a version of the Java SDK 1.2 or higher to be 
  installed. You can get the latest Java SDK from Sun Microsystems
  at http://java.sun.com. Follow the provided instructions in order
  to install the Java SDK properly.

To install Inline::Java do this:

  % perl Makefile.PL J2SDK=/your/java/dir   (see Note 1)
  % make                                    (see Note 2)
  % make test                               (see Note 3, 4)
  % make install

You have to 'make install' before you can run it successfully. 

Note 1: Under Win95/98/Me, you may need to do 'cd ..' to get back to the
your original directory after the command has completed. Also, you may set
either the JAVA_HOME or the PERL_INLINE_JAVA_J2SDK environment variable to 
/your/java/dir instead of using the J2SDK Makefile.PL parameter.

Note 2: Use nmake on Win32.

Note 3: If you have built the JNI extension and want the test suite to use 
it, you will need to set the PERL_INLINE_JAVA_JNI environment variable to 1 
BEFORE running 'make test'.

Note 4: When testing Inline::Java, it's always a good idea to run 'make test'
twice. The first time you test the building and loading of a module, the 
second time you test loading of an already built module.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FEATURES FOR THIS VERSION:

Inline::Java version 0.52 is a minor upgrade that includes:
    - Fixed JNI on cygwin (many thanks to Eric Rybski for the patch)
    - Improved installation. 'make java' is now performed automatically.
    - Fixed problems with disappearing exceptions by localizing $@.
    - Other minor bug fixes.

See CHANGES for a full change list.
