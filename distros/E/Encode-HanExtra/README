NAME
    Encode::HanExtra - Extra sets of Chinese encodings

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.23 of Encode::HanExtra, released
    November 10, 2007.

SYNOPSIS
        use Encode;

        # Traditional Chinese
        $euc_tw = encode("euc-tw", $utf8);   # loads Encode::HanExtra implicitly
        $utf8   = decode("euc-tw", $euc_tw); # ditto

        # Simplified Chinese
        $gb18030 = encode("gb18030", $utf8);    # loads Encode::HanExtra implicitly
        $utf8    = decode("gb18030", $gb18030); # ditto

DESCRIPTION
    Perl 5.7.3 and later ships with an adequate set of Chinese encodings,
    including the commonly used "CP950", "CP936" (also known as "GBK"),
    "Big5" (alias for "Big5-Eten"), "Big5-HKSCS", "EUC-CN", "HZ", and
    "ISO-IR-165".

    However, the numbers of Chinese encodings are staggering, and a complete
    coverage will easily increase the size of perl distribution by several
    megabytes; hence, this CPAN module tries to provide the rest of them.

    If you are using Perl 5.8 or later, Encode::CN and Encode::TW will
    automatically load the extra encodings for you, so there's no need to
    explicitly write "use Encode::HanExtra" if you are using one of them
    already.

ENCODINGS
    This version includes the following encoding tables:

    Detailed descriptions are as follows:

    BIG5-1984
        This is the original Big5 encoding made by TCA Taiwan.

    BIG5-2003
        This revised encoding is now national standard, as an appendix of
        CNS11643.

    BIG5PLUS
        This encoding, while not heavily used, is an attempt to bring all
        Taiwan's conflicting internal-use encodings together, and fit it as
        an extension to the widely-deployed Big5 range, by CMEX Taiwan.

    BIG5EXT
        The CMEX's second (and less ambitious) try at unifying the most
        commonly used characters not covered by Big5, while not polluting
        out of the 94x94 arragement like BIG5PLUS did.

    CCCII
        The earliest (and most sophisticated) Traditional Chinese encoding,
        with a three-byte raw character map, made in 1980 by the Chinese
        Character Analysis Group (CCAG), used mostly in library systems.

    EUC-TW
        The EUC transport version of "CNS11643" (planes 1-7), the
        comprehensive character set used by the Taiwan government.

    CNS11643-*
        The raw character map extracted from the Unihan database, including
        the plane F which wasn't included in "EUC-TW".

    GB18030
        An extension to GBK, this encoding lists most Han characters (both
        simplified and traditional), as well as some other encodings used by
        other peoples in China.

    UNISYS
        Unisys System's internal Chinese mapping.

NOTES
    If you are looking for ways to transliterate between Simplified and
    Traditional Chinese, please take a look at Encode::HanConvert. Note that
    the direct mapping via Unicode is lossy, and usually doesn't work at
    all.

    Please send me suggestions if you want to see more encoding added, such
    as "BIG5-GCCS" (superseded by "BIG5-HKSCS"). Other suggestions are
    welcome, too.
