NAME
    Devel::SearchINC - Loading Perl modules from their development
    directories

VERSION
    version 2.103460

SYNOPSIS
      # export PERL5OPT=-MDevel::SearchINC=/my/dev/dir
      # now use your new modules

DESCRIPTION
    When developing a new module, I always start with a standard skeleton
    distribution directory. The directory structure is such, however, that
    you have to install the module first (with "make install") before you
    can use it in another program or module. For example, bringing in a
    module like so:

        use My::Module;

    requires the module to be somewhere in a path listed in @INC, and the
    relative path is expected to be "My/Module.pm". However, "h2xs" creates
    a structure where the module ends up in "My/Module/Module.pm".

    This module tries to compensate for that. The idea is that you "use()"
    it right at the beginning of your program so it can modify @INC to look
    for modules in relative paths of the special structure mentioned above,
    starting with directories specified along with the "use()" statement
    (i.e. the arguments passed to this module's "import()").

    This is useful because with this module you can test your programs using
    your newly developed modules without having to install them just so you
    can use them. This is especially advantageous when you consider working
    on many new modules at the same time.

    To automatically make your development modules available to all your
    scripts, you can place the following in your ".bashrc" (or your shell
    initialization file of choice):

      export PERL5OPT=-MDevel::SearchINC=/my/dev/dir

    Tilde expansion is also performed.

    When this module is first run, that is, when perl first consults @INC,
    all candidate files are remembered in a cache (see "build_cache()"). A
    candidate file is one whose name ends in ".pm", is not within a
    directory called "t", "CVS", ".svn", ".git", "skel" or "_build", and is
    within a directory called "lib", "blib/lib" or "blib/arch". This is a
    long-winded way of saying that it tries to find your perl module files
    within standard development directories.

    If a directory contains a file named "INC.SKIP", this directory will be
    skipped.

    Note that there is a small limitation for the "PERL5OPT" approach:
    development modules can't be loaded via "-M" on the perl command line.
    So the following won't work:

      $ export PERL5OPT=-MDevel::SearchINC=/my/dev/dir
      $ perl -MMy::Brand::New::Module -e'print "hello world\n"'

    This is because "PERL5OPT" options are processed after the actual
    command line options.

    Also, the "PERL5OPT" variable is ignored when Taint checks are enabled.

FUNCTIONS
  build_cache
    Called during "import()", this subroutine builds a cache of the modules
    it finds. This way every time a module is "use()"d, we can just look at
    the cache. This does mean that if you add, change or delete a module
    during the run-time of a script that uses "Devel::SearchINC", that
    script won't notice these changes. If necessary, you could re-run
    "build_cache()".

MULTIPLE DEVELOPMENT DIRECTORIES
    You can have multiple development directories. Just list them when using
    this module:

      use Devel::SearchINC qw(/my/first/dir my/second/dir);

    or

      perl -MDevel::SearchINC=/my/first/dir,/my/second/dir

    You can also use semicolons or colons instead of commas as delimiters
    for directories.

    "perlrun" details the syntax for specifying multiple arguments for
    modules brought in with the "-M" switch.

SPECIAL OPTIONS
    In addition to development directories, there are special options that
    can be passed to this module:

    "-debug"
        This turns on debugging; see below.

    "-clear"
        This option clears all paths that were previously set. This is
        useful when you have a "PERL5OPT" environment variable but want to
        use this module from within your code as well and want to override
        the environment setting. For example:

            export PERL5OPT=-MDevel::SearchINC=/path/to/dev

        then:

            #!/usr/bin/env perl

            use warnings;
            use strict;
            use Devel::SearchINC qw(-clear /path/to/other/dir);
            ...

DEBUGGING THIS MODULE
    By using "-debug" as one of the development directories, you can turn on
    debugging. Note that despite the leading colon, this has nothing to do
    with "Exporter" semantics. With debugging activated, this module will
    print detailed information while trying to find the requested file.

    For example

      use Devel::SearchINC qw(/my/first/dir my/second/dir -debug);

    or

      perl -MDevel::SearchINC=/my/first/dir,-debug,/my/second/dir

    The "-debug" option can be specified anywhere in the list of development
    directories.
