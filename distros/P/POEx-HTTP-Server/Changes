Revision history for Perl extension POEx::HTTP::Server.

0.0902 May 2, 2013
    - Correct to HTTP::Status::RC_INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR 
            Thank you Olivier Duclos
    - Explicitly call ->close() as an attempt to avoid TIME_WAIT on Windows
    - yield to 'close', so the above doesn't explode
    - Don't use open "-|", use pipe_from_fork() instead
            Thank you Alexandr Ciornii
    - Fixed handling of input errors.  Previously it would crash if a
        malformed request was sent as a second or subsequent request on a
        keep-alive connection.
            Thank you Dzs Bsd

    - It's 'error', not 'client_error'.  This fixes intermittent

    - Start a keepalive timer before we even get a request, to prevent DoS.
