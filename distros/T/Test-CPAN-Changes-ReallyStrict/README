Test::CPAN::Changes::ReallyStrict

This module is for people who want their Changes file to be 1:1
Identical to how it would be if they'd generated it programmatically
with CPAN::Changes.

This is not for the faint of heart, and will whine about even minor
changes of white-space.

You are also at upstream's mercy as to what a changes file looks like,
and in order to keep this test happy, you'll have to update your whole
changes file if upstream changes how they format things.
