NAME
    Text::CSV::Slurp - Text::CSV::Slurp - convert CSV into an array of
    hashes, or an array of hashes into CSV

VERSION
    version 1.03

SUMMARY
    I often need to take a CSV file that has a header row and turn it into a
    perl data structure for further manipulation. This package does that in
    as few steps as possible.

    I added a "create" method in version 0.8 because sometimes you just want
    to create some bog standard CSV from an array of hashes.

USAGE
     use Text::CSV::Slurp;
     use strict;

     # load data from CSV input

     my $data = Text::CSV::Slurp->load(file       => $filename   [,%options]);
     my $data = Text::CSV::Slurp->load(filehandle => $filehandle [,%options]);
     my $data = Text::CSV::Slurp->load(string     => $string     [,%options]);

     # create a string of CSV from an array of hashes
     my $csv  = Text::CSV::Slurp->create( input => \@array_of_hashes [,%options]);

METHODS
  new
     my $slurp = Text::CSV::Slurp->new();

    Instantiate an object.

  load
      my $data = Text::CSV::Slurp->load(file => $filename);
      my $data = $slurp->load(file => $filename);

    Returns an arrayref of hashrefs. Any extra arguments are passed to
    Text::CSV. The first line of the CSV is assumed to be a header row. Its
    fields are used as the keys for each of the hashes.

  create
     my $csv = Text::CSV::Slurp->create( input => \@array_of_hashes [,%options]);
     my $csv = $slurp->create( input => \@array_of_hashes [,%options]);

     my $file = "/path/to/output/file.csv";

     open( FH, ">$file" ) || die "Couldn't open $file $!";
     print FH $csv;
     close FH;

    Creates CSV from an arrayref of hashrefs and returns it as a string. All
    optional arguments are passed to Text::CSV except for "field_order".

   field_order
    "field_order" which is used to determine the fields and order in which
    they appear in the CSV. For example:

     my $csv = Text::CSV::Slurp->create( input => \@array_of_hashes,
                                         field_order => ['one','three','two'] );

    If field_order is not supplied then the sorted keys of the first hash in
    the input are used instead.
