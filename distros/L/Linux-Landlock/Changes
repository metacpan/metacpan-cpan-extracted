0.9   2025-08-24
     - add support for Landlock ABI 6
     - add the option to restrict the used ABI version
     - deprecate ll_create_fs_ruleset/ll_create_net_ruleset. Will be removed before 1.0.

0.8   2024-06-15T00:17:56+02:00
     - add support for Landlock ABI 5
     - switch to Math::BigInt to support pure 32-bit Perls

0.7   2024-05-25T14:38:00+02:00
     - require Perl 5.22 or newer, since fileno on directory handles
       is more or less essential for this module
     - do not allow access to . in allow_perl_inc_access()
     - skip tests that rely on external binaries if they are not available

0.6   2024-05-16T23:04:17+02:00
    - deal gracefully with missing Landlock support and unknown syscall numbers
    - return the actually applied access bits instead of just 1

0.5   2024-05-12T13:32:00+02:00
    - emulate pack('Q', ...) on Perls without 64-bit integers
    - add some diagnostic output to tests

0.4   2024-05-11T01:04:45+02:00
    - rework syscall handling
    - mask out unsupported access bits to provide "best effort" sandboxing if unknown
      access bits are used, e.g. when running on older kernels
    - do not bail out in tests if functionality is not supported
    - change ll_all_fs_access_supported and ll_all_net_access_supported to return bitmasks

0.3   2024-05-10T00:39:49+02:00
    - rename Linux::Landlock::Ruleset to Linux::Landlock

0.2    2024-05-09T23:43:52+02:00

    - some packaging and metadata fixes
    - add tests for network actions on kernels without support

0.1   2024-05-09T22:10:40+02:00

    - initial release
