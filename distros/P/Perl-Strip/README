NAME
    Perl::Strip - reduce file size by stripping whitespace, comments, pod
    etc.

SYNOPSIS
       use Perl::Strip;

DESCRIPTION
    This module transforms perl sources into a more compact format. It does
    this by removing most whitespace, comments, pod, and by some other
    means.

    The resulting code looks obfuscated, but perl (and the deparser) don't
    have any problems with that. Depending on the source file you can expect
    about 30-60% "compression".

    The main target for this module is low-diskspace environments, such as
    App::Staticperl, boot floppy/CDs/flash environments and so on.

    See also the commandline utility perlstrip.

METHODS
    The "Perl::Strip" class is a subclsass of PPI::Transform, and as such
    inherits all of it's methods, even the ones not documented here.

    my $transform = new Perl::Strip key => value...
        Creates a new Perl::Strip transform object. It supports the
        following parameters:

        optimise_size => $bool
            By default, this module optimises *compressability*, not raw
            size. This switch changes that (and makes it slower).

        keep_nl => $bool
            By default, whitespace will either be stripped or replaced by a
            space. If this option is enabled, then newlines will not be
            removed. This has the advantage of keeping line number
            information intact (e.g. for backtraces), but of course doesn't
            compress as well.

        cache => $path
            Since this module can take a very long time (minutes for the
            larger files in the perl distribution), it can utilise a cache
            directory. The directory will be created if it doesn't exist,
            and can be deleted at any time.

    $perl = $transform->strip ($perl)
        Strips the perl source in $perl and returns the stripped source.

SEE ALSO
    App::Staticperl, Perl::Squish.
