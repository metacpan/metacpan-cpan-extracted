NAME
    RTx::EmailCompletion - Add auto completion on RT email fields

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.06 of RTx::EmailCompletion.

DESCRIPTION
    I'm so tired to type email address by hand that I've done this module to
    add AJAX autocompletion on all email field of RT. As adding completion
    is dynamic, it should work on most RT releases (see later if it's not
    the case).

    There's 4 things :

    *   a small web service `html/Ajax/EmailCompletion' which search in all
        known users in the database ;

    *   prototype library to manipulate DOM and scriptaculous library to
        autocomplete ;

    *   a small javascript which parse html pages and add autocomplete on
        known input tags.

    *   a perl module to handle all the logic

INSTALLATION
    if upgrading from a previous release see later UPGRADE FROM PREVIOUS
    RELEASE

    if you upgrade from a version older than 0.05 of this module with RT >=
    3.8, see later SCRIPTACULOUS AND RT 3.8

    Install it like a standard perl module :

     RTHOME=/opt/rt3 perl Makefile.PL
     make
     make install

CONFIGURATION
    In RT 3.8 and later, to enable EmailCompletion plugin, you must add
    something like that in your etc/RT_SiteConfig.pm :

        Set(@Plugins,(qw(RTx::EmailCompletion)));

    This section is fairly long but you don't really need to read it if you
    just want the basic : autocompletion only for privileged users against
    all registred users of RT database.

  unprivileged users autocompletion

    By default, completion works only for privileged users.

    You can activate it for unprivileged users (in the SelfService) by
    setting $EmailCompletionUnprivileged in RTHOME/etc/RT_SiteConfig.pm.
    There's three ways :

    * show everybody
          Set($EmailCompletionUnprivileged,"everybody");

        Be careful, this will also show all yours LDAP users.

    * show only privileged users
          Set($EmailCompletionUnprivileged,"privileged");

        This won't show LDAP users

    * show only email matching a regexp
          Set($EmailCompletionUnprivileged, qr/\@my\.corp\.domain$/ );

        This will also show LDAP user mails that matchs the regexp

  change the database clause to search email

    You can also change the operator used in the `where' clause to search
    email with the global var $RT::EmailCompletionSearch. The default one is
    `LIKE'.

    To change it, add a line like this in RTHOME/etc/RT_SiteConfig.pm :

     Set($EmailCompletionSearch, "STARTSWITH");

    This variable can take the values `LIKE', `STARTSWITH' and `ENDSWITH'.

    By default, the plugin searches on Users.EmailAddress.

    You can change where it searches by setting $EmailCompletionSearchFields
    in RTHOME/etc/RT_SiteConfig.pm to an arrayref of fields from the Users
    table.

       Set( $EmailCompletionSearchFields, [qw(EmailAddress RealName Name)] );

    This would allow you to search by usernames, full names and email
    addresses

  LDAP configuration

    Starting with RTx::EmailCompletion 0.03, autocompletion works with LDAP
    servers.

    If you already have installed and configured LDAP authentication
    overlay, this configuration will be used and it should/could work just
    as it is.

    The following configuration parameters applied :

    * EmailCompletionLdapServer : the ldap server (mandatory)
          Set($EmailCompletionLdapServer, "my.ldap.server");

        If not set, RTx::EmailCompletion will search for LdapServer
        parameter (configured for the LDAP RT authentification layout and
        some others LDAP RT extensions).

    * EmailCompletionLdapBase : the ldap base (mandatory)
          Set($EmailCompletionLdapBase, "dc=debian,dc=org");

        If not set, RTx::EmailCompletion will search for LdapBase parameter
        (configured for the LDAP RT authentification layout and some others
        LDAP RT extensions).

    * EmailCompletionLdapUser : the ldap user if you need authentication
          Set($EmailCompletionLdapUser, "myldapuser");

        If not set, RTx::EmailCompletion will search for LdapUser parameter
        (configured for the LDAP RT authentification layout and some others
        LDAP RT extensions).

    * EmailCompletionLdapPass : the ldap password if you need authentication
          Set($EmailCompletionLdapPass, "mypassword");

        If not set, RTx::EmailCompletion will search for LdapPass parameter
        (configured for the LDAP RT authentification layout and some others
        LDAP RT extensions).

    * EmailCompletionLdapFilter : the ldap filter if needed
          Set($EmailCompletionLdapFilter, "(objectclass=person)");

        If not set, RTx::EmailCompletion will search for LdapFilter
        parameter (configured for the LDAP RT authentification layout).

    * EmailCompletionLdapAttrSearch : the ldap search attributes
          Set($EmailCompletionLdapAttrSearch, [qw/mail cn/]);

        Default value is mail.

    * EmailCompletionLdapAttrShow : the mail attribute name
          Set($EmailCompletionLdapAttrShow, "mail");

        Default value is mail

    * EmailCompletionLdapMinLength : minimum parameter length to send an
    ldap request
          Set(EmailCompletionLdapMinLength, 6);

        Default value is 4

    The minimum LDAP configuration look somethink like this :

      Set($EmailCompletionLdapServer, "db.debian.org");
      Set($EmailCompletionLdapBase, "dc=debian,dc=org");

    You can disable ldap completion (useful if you have installed ldap
    authentication overlay and you don't want ldap completion) with :

      Set($EmailCompletionLdapDisabled, 1);

    If you want to keep only LDAP completion, you can also disable RDBMS :

      Set($EmailCompletionRdbmsDisabled, 1);

    The given value must be true for perl.

HOW TO ADD FIELD TO AUTOCOMPLETION
    If you find email field without autocomplete, you can modify
    `html/NoAuth/js/emailcompletion.js' to handle this field (and email me
    to patch this module).

    At the beginning of this file you will find two global vars
    `multipleCompletion' and `singleCompletion'. They are array of regexp.

    Regexp must match all the word because `^' and `$' are added for
    matching. So if you want to match `Field1' and `Field2' you must add
    something like `Field.' or better `Field[12]'.

    To verify that javascript find your input tag, you can uncomment the
    line just after the "DEBUGGING PURPOSE" one. All input tags find by the
    script will appear with a big red border.

UPGRADE FROM PREVIOUS RELEASE
    Because of a change in Makefile.PL, if you upgrade from a previous
    release, you should delete everything from this package. You can find

      find RTHOME | grep -i emailcompletion

SCRIPTACULOUS AND RT 3.8
    RT 3.8 and later come with their own scriptaculous library. So if you
    have installed an release older than 0.05 of this module with RT 3.8 and
    later, the original scriptaculous will be overriden by this module.

    The best solution is to remove RTHOME/share/html/NoAuth/js/ and copy
    RTSOURCE/share/html/NoAuth/js/ to RTHOME/share/html/NoAuth/.

    This release is not subject to this problem.

HISTORY
    The first version (unreleased) modify html pages. The better method
    actually used allow this module to be compatible with, virtually, all RT
    release.
