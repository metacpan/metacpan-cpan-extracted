=head1 NAME

SVG::Sparkline::Cookbook - Performing specific tasks with SVG::Sparklines

=head1 VERSION

This document describes L<SVG::Sparkline> version 1.12.

=head1 INTRODUCTION

This Cookbook was conceived as a way to make usage of the L<SVG::Sparkline>
module somewhat easier even if you do not spend a lot of time learning it.

The first thing to realize about this module is that it is not intended to
be a full mapping/charting/graphing tool. If you need fancy markers, lots of
data sets, 3D effects, and so on, you should look for a more general graphing
module. Searching CPAN for I<Chart> or I<Graph> should expose several likely
modules.

=head1 ON SPARKLINES

The sparklines concept is described in Edward Tufte's book I<Beautiful Evidence>.
An excerpt of the book relating to sparklines can be found on his website
L<http://www.edwardtufte.com/>.

The important portions of Tufte's explanation are that a sparkline is

=over 4

=item *

Intense

=item *

Simple

=item *

Word-sized

=back

To the extent possible, I have used these principles to guide me in the 
features I decide to include or exclude from the module.

Starting at the bottom, sparklines should be I<word-sized>. We are talking
about something that can easily be embedded in text or a table. Sparklines
are not about page-sized graphics with lots of detail.

This size issue leads to the I<simple> aspect. It is hard to get hundreds of
individual data points into a word-sized graphic. Likewise a small graphic
containing 20 different datasets is likely to be overly complex. Part of the
effect of the sparkline is that it is simple enough that you can grasp it
quickly without need for extended study. This is only possible if the graphic
is as simple as possible.

Finally, Tufte says a sparkline should be intense. The data being displayed
should be dynamic enough that it shows important characteristics even after
simplifying the graphic and making it word sized.

A horizontal line, or bar graph with minimal variation is probably not going to
be very intense. Likewise a graphic with too much variation will overwhelm the
eye and lose the effect.

=head1 RECIPES

=head2 Basic Configuration

There are a few configuration items that apply to all sparkline types.

=head2 How to choose a Sparkline Type

Choosing the sparkline type is a judgement call based on the data you need to
display and the look you want to convey. The following suggestions may help
you decide which type is right for your circumstance.

=head3 Binary outcomes

The I<Whisker> sparkline type easily displays a series of binary outcomes, such
as wins/losses on a game or coin flips (heads/tails).

=head3 Discrete data

The I<Bar> sparkline type displays discrete data well. When attempting to
compare a number of values, I<Bar> displays work well. When continuous data
has been aggregated into a small number of categories, (e.g. rainfall amount
per month for twelve months), a I<Bar> sparkline also works well.

If the discrete data describes a range of high and low values (two values for
each data point), then the I<RangeBar> sparkline type is more appropriate.

=head3 Time-series data

When attempting to display continuously changing data or time-series data,
the I<Line> and I<Area> sparkline types are most appropriate.

If the continuous data describes a range of high and low values (two values
for each data point), then the I<RangeArea> sparkline type is more
appropriate.

=head2 Creating basic sparklines

=head3 I want to create a sparkline for time-series data.

Let's say you have a set of data points that represent regular samples of
a time-series data set in the array C<@samples>. To create a simple
sparkline, you would do the following:

   my $sl = SVG::Sparkline->new( Line => { values => \@samples } );

If the line isn't dramatic enough, you could do an I<Area> sparkline, as follows:

   my $sl = SVG::Sparkline->new( Area => { values => \@samples } );

=head3 I want to create a sparkline for discrete data.

Let's say you have a set of data points that represent a discrete data set
in the array C<@samples>. To create a simple sparkline, you would do the
following:

   my $sl = SVG::Sparkline->new( Bar => { values => \@samples } );

=head3 I want to create a sparkline for wins and losses for sports team.

Some data doesn't really have a range of values beyond a binary choice:
high/low, win/loss, heads/tails, etc. The appropriate choice for this is
the I<Whisker> sparkline type.

If you had a teams win/loss record in an array of '+' and '-' characters
called @games, you could build the sparkline like this:

   my $sl = SVG::Sparkline->new( Whisker => { values => @games } );

=head3 I want to plot two related time series data streams (highs/lows).

The I<RangeArea> sparkline type is just what you need. First, you need to
get the data into the proper form. The I<RangeArea> type expects data as
an arrayref of arrayrefs containing pairs of numeric data.

=head2 Changing the display

Once you have sparkline type, you may need to customize the sparkline.

=head3 How do I make the sparkline taller/shorter?

The L<SVG::Sparkline> constructor supports an optional I<height> parameter that
controls the pixel height of the sparkline. Since the data is automatically
scaled to fit the height, this attribute also helps determine the resolution that
is displayed.

   my $sl = SVG::Sparkline->new( Line => { values =>\@samples, height=>18 } );

The above code generates a sparkline 1.5x as tall as the default. Although SVG
supports (practically) infinitely scalable graphics, You should tend to make
your sparklines close to the height of the text you are embedding it within.

If you need graphs substantially larger than that, another graphing library with
more customizability is probably a better choice.

=head3 How do I extend/reduce the sparkline horizontally?

The L<SVG::Sparkline> constructor supports an optional I<width> parameter that
specifies the width of the sparkline in pixels. L<SVG::Sparkline> uses this
parameter to scale the sparkline horizontally. For I<Line> and I<Area> sparklines
this changes the horizontal resolution of the data. For I<Bar> and I<Whisker>
sparklines this changes the width of the bar or whisker.

   my $sl => SVG::Sparkline->new( Bar => { values=>\@rainfall, width=>60 } );

Assuming that we have one rainfall entry per month in the C<@rainfall> array, this
would give us a 60 pixel wide sparkline, with each bar being 5 pixels wide.

=head3 How do I change the color of the sparkline?

The L<SVG::Sparkline> constructor supports an optional I<color> parameter that
specifies the color of the display element. The value of this parameter must be
in a format that SVG understands.

   my $sl = SVG::Sparkline->new( Area => { values=>\@depth, color=>'#0000ff' } );

This would make an area graph with the filled area being blue. See the recipe
L</"How do I specify a color for the data, background, or marks?"> for legal color formats.

=head3 How do I change the color of the background?

The L<SVG::Sparkline> constructor supports an optional I<bgcolor> parameter that
specifies the color of the background. The value of this parameter must be
in a format that SVG understands.

   my $sl = SVG::Sparkline->new( Line => { values=>\@depth, bgcolor=>'silver' } );

This would make a line graph on a light gray background. See the recipe
L</"How do I specify a color for the data, background, or marks?"> for legal color formats.

By default, the background should be transparent.

=head3 How do I specify a color for the data, background, or marks?

Colors are specified using the color definitions defined for SVG. These formats include

=over 4

=item 6 digit rgb hex

This is the normal HTML colors you may already be used to. C<#88ff88> would be a
light green.

=item 3 digit rgb hex

This is a short form of the normal hex string C<#f00> would be red. To convert the
3 digit form into the 6 digit form, just double each digit (C<#f00> becomes C<#ff0000>
and C<#123> becomes C<#112233>).

=item rgb() functional notation

This form takes three number between 0 and 255. So, C<rgb(255,0,127)> is equivalent
to C<#ff007f>.

=item rgb() percentage functional notation

This is like the previous form, but uses percentages instead. (e.g. C<rgb(100%,50%,75%)>).

=item color names

The SVG specification has an extended list of color names that can be used to
name colors. This includes the normal colors of I<red>, I<green>, I<blue>, I<white>,
I<black>, I<yellow>, I<magenta>, I<cyan>, I<gray>, I<silver>, etc.

=back

=head3 I need to mark a specific data point on the sparkline.

It is often useful to be able to mark specific data points on a sparkline so
that you can refer to them elsewhere. You mark a specific data point with the
C<mark> parameter. For example,

  my $sl = SVG::Sparkline->new(
        Line=>{ values=>\@rainfall, mark=>[14=>'blue'] }
  );

This would show our rainfall line graph with a blue dot on the data for
the 15th (14 0-based).

The C<mark> attribute takes pairs of values. The first item of each pair is an
index (or one of four special terms: first, last, high, and low). The second item
is a SVG-supported color as described in
L</"How do I specify a color for the data, background, or marks?">.

If you need more than one mark, simply add more pairs to the anonymous array.

=head3 I need to mark the high and low values on a sparkline.

So, you can mark a particular index, but what if you don't want to figure out
the index for the high and low values (especially, if you are generating this
sparkline multiple times). The special index terms C<high> and C<low> come to
the rescue.

  my $sl = SVG::Sparkline->new(
        `Line=>{ values=>\@rainfall, mark=>[high=>'green', low=>'red'] }
  );

This will generate two dots on the sparkline: a green one at the high value
and a red one at the low value.

=head3 I want a little more space above/below the data in the sparkline.

The C<pady> parameter specifies the amount of padding between the displayed
data and the top/bottom of the sparkline in pixels. The default value of
C<pady> is 1 pixel if none is specified.

  my $sl = SVG::Sparkline->new(
        Line=>{ values=>\@rainfall, pady=>3 }
  );

This adds 2 more pixels of spacing between the highest and lowest values of
the data and the top and bottom of the sparkline graphic. To add paddin to the
left and right, see the next recipe.

=head3 I want a little more space to the left/right of the data in the sparkline.

The C<padx> parameter specifies the amount of padding between the displayed
data and the left and right of the sparkline in pixels. The default value of
C<padx> is 0 pixels if none is specified.

  my $sl = SVG::Sparkline->new(
        Line=>{ values=>\@rainfall, padx=>2 }
  );

This adds 2 more pixels of spacing between the data and the left and right of
the sparkline graphic. To add padding to the top and bottom, see the previous
recipe.

=head2 Area Sparklines

=head3 My Area sparkline is too spiky, how can I spread it out?

There are two ways to change the spacing between data points on an I<Area>
sparkline: setting the I<width> and setting the x-scaling.

If you have a fixed width in mind (say 100 pixels), you can set the width of
the area graph as follows:

   my $sl = SVG::Sparkline->new(
        Area => { values=>\@temps, width=>100 }
   );

On the other hand, if you don't have a fixed width in mind, but you still want
the data points farther apart, the I<xscale> parameter specifies the number of
pixels between individual data points. The default scale is 2 pixels. If you
wanted to double the spacing, you would do this:

   my $sl = SVG::Sparkline->new(
        Area => { values=>\@temps, xscale=>4 }
   );

=head2 Bar Sparklines

=head3 I want the bars to be wider/narrower on my Bar sparkline.

There are two ways to change the width of the bars on a I<Bar> sparkline.
The L<SVG::Sparkline> constructor supports an optional I<thick> parameter that
specifies the bar thickness (in pixels) on a I<Bar> sparkline. For example,

  my $sl = SVG::Sparkline->new( Bar=>{ values=>\@rainfall, thick=>6 } );

generates bars that are 6 pixels wide, instead of the default 3.

Specifying a I<width> different than the default also changes the bar size. The
bar size defaults to the I<width> divided by the number of data points.

  my $sl = SVG::Sparkline->new( Bar=>{ values=>\@rainfall, width=>120 } );

If we assume 12 months of data in C<@rainfall>, the bars are drawn 10 pixels wide.

=head3 I want spacing between my bars on my Bar sparkline.

The default I<Bar> sparkline has no spacing between the bars for the maximum use
of space. (After all, sparklines are supposed to be small.) You can change the
spacing through the use of the I<gap> parameter. For example, if you want two
pixels of spacing between the bars, you would do the following:

  my $sl = SVG::Sparkline->new( Bar=>{ values=>\@rainfall, gap=>2 } );

=head2 Line Sparklines

=head3 I want to change the thickness of the line.

The thickness of the line on the I<Line> sparkline is controlled by the optional
I<thick> parameter to the constructor. This parameter specifies the stroke width
of the line in pixels.

  my $sl = SVG::Sparkline->new( Line=>{ values=>\@highs, thick=>2 } );

generates a line 2 pixels wide instead of the default 1 pixel line.

=head3 My Line sparkline is too spiky, how can I spread it out?

See L</"My Area sparkline is too spiky, how can I spread it out?">. The same approach
works with a I<Line> sparkline.

=head2 RangeArea Sparklines

=head3 I want to spread out the sparkline so it's not spiky.

See L</"My Area sparkline is too spiky, how can I spread it out?">. The same approach
works with a I<RangeArea> sparkline.

=head2 RangeBar Sparklines

=head3 I want the bars to be wider/narrower on my RangeBar sparkline.

See L</"I want the bars to be wider/narrower on my Bar sparkline."> The same
technique works for I<RangeBar>.

=head3 I want spacing between my bars on my RangeBar sparkline.

See L</"I want spacing between my bars on my Bar sparkline."> The same
technique works for I<RangeBar>.

=head2 Whisker Sparklines

=head3 I want the Whiskers to be thicker/thinner.

There are two ways to change the thickness of the whiskers on a I<Whisker>
sparkline. The L<SVG::Sparkline> constructor supports an optional I<thick>
parameter that specifies the whisker thickness (in pixels) on a I<Whisker>
sparkline. For example,

  my $sl = SVG::Sparkline->new( Whisker=>{ values=>\@tosses, thick=>2 } );

generates whiskers that are 2 pixels wide, instead of the default 1.

Specifying a I<width> different than the default also changes the
whisker size. The whisker size defaults to 1/3 the I<width> divided by the
number of data points.

  my $sl = SVG::Sparkline->new( Whisker=>{ values=>\@tosses, width=>120 } );

If there are 10 values in C<@tosses>, the whiskers are drawn 4 pixels wide.

=head3 I want to change the spacing between the whiskers on my sparkline.

The distance between the whiskers can be changed either by modifying the
width of the sparkline or through the use of the I<gap> parameter.

By default, the I<gap> is twice the I<thick>ness of the whiskers. To change that,
specify a value in pixels as shown below:

   my $sl = SVG::Sparkline->new( Whisker=>{ values=\@tosses, gap=>5 } );

=head2 Using the generated sparklines

=head3 I want to write the sparkline to a file.

Use the C<print> global function to write to a file. The C<SVG::Sparkline>
is converted to a string using the C<SVG::Sparkline::to_string> method,
automatically. For example,

    my $sl = SVG::Sparkline->new( Bar=>{ values=>\@rainfall } );
    open( my $fh, '>', 'rainfall_sparkline.svg' )
        or die "Unable to create rainfall_sparkline.svg.\n";
    print $fh $sl;
    close( $fh );

This will result in an SVG file on disk containing the sparkline.

You can also covert a sparkline to a string my calling the
C<SVG::Sparkline::to_string> method directly.

=head3 I want to embed the sparkline in an HTML file.

Eventually, most browsers will support mixed-namespace documents, and you will be
able to write the SVG directly into your XHTML document. Until then, the most
robust solution is to write out the file and reference it from your document.

There are several approaches, including the C<iframe> tag, the C<img> tag, the
C<object> tag, and the C<embed> tag. At present, the C<iframe> seems to be the
simplest and most robust solution.

Given a sparkline in the file F<rainfall_sparkline.svg>, put the following in your
HTML to include the sparkline:

   <iframe height="12" width="36" src="rainfall_sparkline.svg"
       style="border:0;" alt="Rainfall amounts"></iframe>

Of course, you may need to adjust the height and width to match your sparkline.

=head3 I want to embed the sparkline in an XHTML(+xml) file.

You should be able to copy the SVG from the sparkline directly into the XHTML file
where you would like it to appear. Browsers that support <em>complex documents</em>
should display the SVG along with everything else.

=head3 I want to embed the sparkline in an SVG file.

You can copy the SVG directly from the sparkline into the SVG file. However, you
will need to make a minor change to the result. You either need to modify the
sparkline to position it in the SVG. There are basically 3 ways to accomplish this:

=over 4

=item Modify the sparkline C<svg> tag to have C<x> and C<y> attributes.

The C<x> and C<y> attributes are used to position a nested C<svg> tag within the
area of the outer C<svg> tag. By default, the sparkline's C<svg> tag would be
positioned at (0,0).

=item Modify the sparkline C<svg> tag to have a C<transform> attribute.

The C<transform> attribute can position a tag using the C<translate(x,y)>
function.  This would have the same effect as positioning the sparkline with
the C<x> and C<y> attributes. The only real reason for positioning this way is
if you wanted to provide scaling or rotation as well.

=item Surround the sparkline in a C<g> tag and position the group.

This approach has the advantage that you don't actually have to change the
sparkline.  Put the content of the sparkline inside a C<g> tag and use the
C<transform> attribute to place it.

   <g transform="translate(100,250)"><svg/></g>

where the C<< E<lt>svg/> >> is replaced with your actual sparkline.

=back

=head2 Decorations

=head3 How do I add a box around the sparkline?

As Tuft explains in I<Beautiful Evidence> this kind of decoration overwhelms the
actual data being displayed. That defeats the purpose of the sparkline. For this
reason, L<SVG::Sparkline> does not provide an automatic way to put a border
around the sparkline.

If you want to have a border despite Tuft's advice, you can use the border
attribute on the container you use for the SVG. For example, if you used the
C<iframe> approach from L</"I want to embed the sparkline in an HTML file.">

   <iframe height="12" width="36" src="rainfall_sparkline.svg"
       style="border:1 solid black;" alt="Rainfall amounts"></iframe>

Changing the border style should have the effect you want.

=head3 How do I add a grid under the sparkline?

The L<SVG::Sparkline> does not currently support grids. I am concerned that
adding a grid might also violate Tufte's intent for the sparkline.

At present, the best solution would be to generate a grid of the appropriate
dimensions and overlay it with the sparkline. This only works if the sparkline
has no background color, which leaves the background transparent.
