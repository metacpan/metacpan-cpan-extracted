Hash-AutoHash-AVPairsMulti

This is a subclass of Hash::AutoHash which wraps a tied hash whose
elements contain multiple simple values like numbers and strings, not
references.  Hash::AutoHash::Record uses this class to represent
attribute-value pairs parsed from text
files. Hash::AutoHash::AVPairsSingle is similar but requires each
attribute to have a single value.  Hash::AutoHash::MultiValued is
similar, but permits values to be non-simple, ie, references.
