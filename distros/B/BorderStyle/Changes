3.0.0   2022-02-14  Released-By: PERLANCAR; Backward-Incompatible: yes; Urgency: medium

        [INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES]

        - Bump specification version from 2 to 3 due to incompatible changes.

        - Remove `chars` in border style structure and abstract it through
          `get_border_char()` to be more flexible, e.g. to allow for footer
          area, vertical header (header columns), and so on.

        - Replace the positional arguments in `get_border_char()` with named
          arguments to be more flexible. Replace the `x` and `y` arguments
          that refer to character with character `name`, to be more readable.

        [ENHANCEMENTS]

        - Add roles in BorderStyleRole::* to replace BorderStyleBase. There are
          now BorderStyleRole::Source::ASCIIArt to make it easier to add a new
          border style by just "drawing" it.
