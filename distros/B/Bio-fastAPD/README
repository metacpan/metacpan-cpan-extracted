Bio::fastAPD

The Bio::fastAPD module provides computationally efficient methods for the
calculation of average pairwise difference (APD), a measure of nucleotide 
diversity, from multiple sequence alignment (MSA) data. The module also 
provides rapid standard error estimation of the APD using an efficient 
jackknife resampling method. Further description of the methods implemented
in this module, including mathematical justification, will be available in 
an upcoming peer-reviewed journal article.
