Revision history for Net-Joker-DMAPI

0.08   2016-11-18
        - Accept just "1.2" as the version, rather than expecting 1.2.x
          As best I can tell, their version number has gone backwards.

0.07   2016-08-22
        - Always log full response body (req by SKINGTON)

0.06   2015-01-28
        - Some changes from @tczepiel (thanks!) in PR-3 - robustification,
          returning headers and response in list context, handling session
          expiry  nicely, logging out  on DESTROY optional etc.

0.05   2014-10-27 
        - New account_balance method
        - Avoid failing if calling a method with no args hashref.
        - Check parameters passed to query_whois, croak if used wrongly
        - Converted from Moose to Moo

0.04    2014-10-21
        - Loading Data::Dump before using it helps.  I stupidly tested in an
          environment where Data::Dump gets loaded automatically so this didn't
          show up.

0.03    2014-10-21
        - Added new logger attribute, allowing a coderef to be provided to
          receive log messages, for flexible logging however you choose.
        - Compare Joker DMAPI version major version (1.2) only, not the full
          version, or I'll be updating this every five minutes when Joker make
          trivial changes.  (I hope I can rely on them to bump the minor version
          for trivial changes, and bump to e.g. 1.3.00 if they make any more
          significant changes.)


0.02    2014-10-09
        Bah - POD coverage tests failed because of a couple of undocumented
        methods which ought to have been private.  They are now.

0.01    2014-10-09
        First version released.  Works well enough to send arbitrary queries to
        the API, and whois querying and parsing works well, but needs lots more
        work - more methods to handle common operations (rather than having to
        go lower level and use do_query(), and a test suite.
