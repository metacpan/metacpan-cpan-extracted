NAME
    MooseX::Types::FakeHash - Types for emulating Hash-like behaviours with
    ArrayRefs.

VERSION
    version 0.1.2

SYNOPSIS
  Standard Non-MooseX-Types style invocation
      package #
        Foo;

      use Moose;
      use MooseX::Types::FakeHash;

      has foo => (
        isa => 'KeyWith[ ArrayRef ]'
        is  => 'rw',
        required => 1,
      );

      has bar => (
        isa      => 'ArrayRef[ KeyWith[ Str ] ]',
        is       => 'rw',
        required => 1,
      );

      ....


      Foo->new(
        foo => [ Hello => [] ]
        bar => [
           [ "Content-Type" => "text/plain" ],
           [ "X-Zombies"    => "0"          ],
        ],
      );

  MooseX-Types style invocation
      package #
        Foo;

      use Moose;
      use MooseX::Types::FakeHash qw( :all );
      use MooseX::Types::Moose    qw( :all );

      has foo => (
        isa => KeyWith[ ArrayRef ]
        is  => 'rw',
        required => 1,
      );

      has bar => (
        isa      => ArrayRef[ KeyWith[ Str ] ],
        is       => 'rw',
        required => 1,
      );

      ....


      Foo->new(
        foo => [ Hello => [] ]
        bar => [
           [ "Content-Type" => "text/plain" ],
           [ "X-Zombies"    => "0"          ],
        ],
      );

TYPES
  KeyWith
  KeyWith[ X ]
    A parameterizable type intended to simulate a singular key/value pair
    stored in an array.

    The keys is required to be of type "Str", while the value is the
    parameterized type.

      has bar ( isa => KeyWith[ Foo ] , ... );

      ...

      ->new(
        bar => [ "Key" => $fooitem ] # [ Str, Foo ]
      );

  FakeHash
  FakeHash[ X ]
    A parameterizable type intended to simulate the values of a HashRef, but
    stored in an ArrayRef instead as an even number of key/values.

    The keys are required to be of type "Str", while the value is the
    parameterized type.

      has bar ( isa => FakeHash[ Foo ] , ... );

      ...

      ->new(
        bar => [
          "Key"           => $fooitem,
          "AnotherKey"    => $baritem,
          "YetAnotherKey" => $quuxitem,
        ] # [ Str, Foo, Str, Foo, Str, Foo ]
      );

  OrderedFakeHash
  OrderedFakeHash[ X ]
    A parameterizable type intended to simulate the values of a HashRef, but
    stored in an ArrayRef instead as an array of "KeyWith" items. This is
    much like a "FakeHash", but slightly different, in that the paring of
    the Key/Value is stricter, and numerical-offset based lookup is simpler.

      [
         [ "Key" => $value ],
         [ "Key" => $value ],
      ]

    In essence, OrderedFakeHash[ x ] is ShortHand for ArrayRef[ KeyWith[ x ]
    ].

    This makes it harder to convert to a native Perl 5 Hash, but somewhat
    easier to iterate pairwise.

      my $data = $object->orderedfakehashthing();
      for my $pair ( @($data) ){
        my ( $key, $value ) = @{ $pair };
        ....
      }

    The keys are required to be of type "Str", while the value is the
    parameterized type.

      has bar ( isa => OrderedFakeHash[ Foo ] , ... );

      ...

      ->new(
        bar => [
          [ "Key"           => $fooitem  ],
          [ "AnotherKey"    => $baritem  ],
          [ "YetAnotherKey" => $quuxitem ],
        ] # [ [ Str, Foo ],[ Str, Foo ],[ Str, Foo ] ]
      );
