        - declare variables in test files, since some some cpantesters
          complain about it.

0.06    2011, 10 April (22:01)
        - Fixed configure-requires deprendency

0.05    2010, 10 November (18:46)
        - support to detect ispell, aspell or hunspell
        - skip tests if no english dictionary available
        - changed from ExtUtils::MakeMaker to Module::Build
        - Probably I will just stop maintaining this module as nobody
          uses it (as far as I know). So, if you are interested in it
          (if you use it or want to maintain it) let me know.

	- Added support to choose if you want to use nearmisses
	- Added test and code to support unkown dictionaries

0.03    2005, 23 January (19:50)
	- Added support for nearmisses

	the ispell answer "dog");

	- Added support for exist($dic{word})
	- Added support for store: $dic{word} = "now exists";

0.01    2004, 17 December (11:57)
        - First version, released on an unsuspecting world
	- First working minimally working version.
