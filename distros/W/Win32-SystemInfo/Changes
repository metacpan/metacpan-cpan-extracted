0.05  Tues Feb 6, 2001
	- Fixed bug introduced in 0.03 where the $format parameter
	  to MemoryStatus was ignored, and all results returned
	  as bytes.

0.06 - Added new entry to processor information hash to display the name
          of the processor. WindowsNT and 2K now use the DLL to determine
          CPU speed as well.

0.07 - Changed contact information. Recompiled DLL to remove some extraneous calls.   

0.08 - Added more definitions for recent CPUs. Added dependency on version 0.40
          of Win32::API. Reworked Win32::API calls. Changed calls in DLL to
          eliminate need to pack and unpack arguments.

0.09 - Eliminated cpuspd.dll. Should eliminate some of the headaches associated with
          using this module. It should now return CPU info for all flavors of 
          Windows past Win9x without crashing.
      
0.10 - Added bug description for Perl Development Kit. Fixed link to ActiveState module
          location.
          
0.11 - Suppress warnings that come from Win32::API when running with the -w switch. Fix bug
          (http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=30894) where memory could grow 
          uncontrollably.

0.12 - Fix some 64 bit related bugs. Use correct SYSTEM_INFO structure 
 		  (https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=59365) and use correct struct size
 		  (https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=48008).
