=================

The README is used to introduce the module and provide instructions on
how to install the module, any machine dependencies it may have (for

A README file is required for CPAN modules since CPAN extracts the
README file from a module distribution so that people browsing the
archive can use it get an idea of the modules uses. It is usually a
good idea to provide version information here so that people can
decide whether fixes for the module are worth downloading.
