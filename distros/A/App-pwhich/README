NAME

    pwhich - Pure Perl implementation of which

VERSION

    version 1.15

SYNOPSIS

     $ pwhich perl
     $ pwhich -a perl          # print all matches
     $ pwhich perl perldoc ... # look for multiple programs
     $ pwhich -a perl perldoc ...
     $ pwhich -s perl          # silent mode

DESCRIPTION

    pwhich is a command-line utility program for finding paths to other
    programs based on the user's PATH. It is similar to the usually Unix
    tool `which', and tries to emulate its functionality, but is written
    purely in Perl (uses the module File::Which), so is portable.

 Calling syntax

     $ pwhich [-a] [-s] [-v] programname [programname ...]

 Options

    -a

      The option -a will make pwhich print all matches found in the PATH
      variable instead of just the first one. Each match is printed on a
      separate line.

    -s

      No output, just return 0 if any of the executables are found, or 1 if
      none are found.

    -v

      Prints version (of File::Which) and copyright notice and exits.

SUPPORT

    Bugs should be reported via the GitHub issue tracker
