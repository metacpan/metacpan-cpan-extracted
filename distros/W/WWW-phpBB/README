WWW-phpBB version 0.03
======================

DESCRIPTION

This module can be used to scrape a phpBB2 installation using the web interface.
It requires a local phpBB2 setup (you can download the old 2.x versions from
http://sourceforge.net/projects/phpbb/files/phpBB%202/ ) that will be
overwritten and it can only access what is available to the web browser (i.e. no
private messages or user settings). Make sure the username used during the
local installation doesn't exist in the remote forum. Scraping is possible as a
guest or as a logged in member. If used with an administrator name and password
it will copy all the member e-mails (not just the public ones) allowing them to
request a new random password from the new installation site and continue using
the forum. The current implementation lacks search support, but this can be fixed
by converting the forum to phpBB3 or SMF. The "mforum" script is supported.

NOTES

- if you have admin access on the remote forum make sure that emailing through the forum interface is disabled
- on the local forum you might want to enable remote avatars
