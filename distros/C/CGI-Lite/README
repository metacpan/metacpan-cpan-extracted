CGI::Lite v3.02
---------------

Released: 19th May 2018

This is a new release of the 3.x branch. Please be aware of the API
changes from 2.x with particular reference to the deprecated and obsolete
subroutines and methods.


DESCRIPTION
-----------

This module can be used to decode CGI form data, query strings, file
uploads and cookies in a very simple manner.

It has only one dependency and is therefore relatively fast to instantiate.
This makes it well suited to a non-persistent CGI scenario.


NEW IN THIS VERSION
-------------------

These are the changes since the last general release (3.01).

BUG FIX: Uploads on MSWin32 were not correctly converted if the first
    character of a buffer was LF. Changed regex to negative lookarounds.

BUG FIX: Uploads could fail if n * buffer_size fell inside the boundary
    marker. Thanks pru-mike (PR 1). (possibly fixes issue 116670)

BUG FIX: Changing the boundary marker for second and subsequent uploads
    causes errors. Thanks pru-mike (PR 1). (issue 125130)

Test suite enhanced: now with Test::Vars (0.12) and fix of tmp filename
    race condition.

See the CHANGES file for full history.
