Please consult the README to check that you have the necessary
prerequisites.

You install Mail::Field::Received, as you would install any perl
module library, by running these commands:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

If you want to install a private copy of Mail::Field::Received in your
home directory, then you should try to produce the initial Makefile
with something like this command:

   perl Makefile.PL LIB=~/perl
