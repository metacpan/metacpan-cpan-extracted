NAME

    Alien::ghostunnel - Find or install ghostunnel TLS proxy

VERSION

    version 0.01

SYNOPSIS

     use Alien::ghostunnel;
     use Env qw( @PATH );
     
     unshift @PATH, Alien::ghostunnel->bin_dir;
    
     system 'ghostunnel', ...;

DESCRIPTION

    This Alien will find or build ghostunnel
    <https://github.com/ghostunnel/ghostunnel>, and make it available to
    Perl modules. Ghostunnel is a simple TLS proxy with mutual
    authentication support for securing non-TLS backend applications.

    If there is a known binary build on the ghostunnel project page for
    your platform, then that will be downloaded. Otherwise if you have a Go
    compiler available it will be built from source. If neither of those
    options work then you are out of luck, unfortunately.

    If for whatever reason you prefer not to install the binary version of
    ghostunnel, you can set ALIEN_GHOSTUNNEL_SOURCE to a true value when
    installing:

     $ env ALIEN_GHOSTUNNEL_SOURCE=1 cpanm Alien::ghostunnel
