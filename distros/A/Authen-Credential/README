Authen-Credential

This module offers abstractions of credentials, i.e. something that
can be used to authenticate. It allows the creation and manipulation of
credentials. In particular, it defines a standard string representation
(so that credentials can be given to external programs as command line
options), a standard structured representation (so that credentials can
be stored in structured configuration files or using JSON) and
"preparators" that can transform credentials into ready-to-use data for
well known targets.

Different authentication schemes (aka credential types) are supported.
This package currently supports "none", "plain" and "x509" but others
can be added by providing the supporting code in a separate module.

A Python implementation of the same credential abstractions is available
at https://github.com/cern-mig/python-auth-credential so credentials can
be shared between different programming languages.
