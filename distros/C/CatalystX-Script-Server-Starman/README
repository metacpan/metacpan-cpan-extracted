DESCRIPTION
    A Catalyst extension to replace the development server with Starman.

    This module replaces the functionality of
    Catalyst::Engine::HTTP::Prefork, which is now deprecated.

    It provides access to the prefork engine specific options which were
    previously added by hacking your server script.

Adding this to your application
    Just add a server script module to your application which inherits from
    this package.

    Catalyst::ScriptRunner will automatically detect and use it when
    script/myapp_server.pl is started.

    For example:

        package MyApp::Script::Server;
        use Moose;
        use namespace::autoclean;

        extends 'CatalystX::Script::Server::Starman';

        1;
