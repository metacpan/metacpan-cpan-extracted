PREREQUISITES

    Microsoft Windows

        This module only works on "native" (i.e. non-Cygwin) Microsoft Windows.
        (Nothing else has the functions which this module provides emulations of
        anyway.)

    C Compiler

        You need a C compiler to build this module.

        Ideally you should try to use the same compiler as was used to build
        your perl itself, although this is not essential.  (However, there is a
        known compatibility problem when building this module with Visual Studio
        .NET 2002/2003 (VC7) or earlier if your perl was built with Visual
        Studio 2005 (VC8) or later: see Perl RT#121448.)

    Perl

        Perl version 5.8.1 or later.
        The latest version of Perl is available from http://www.perl.com/.

    Perl Modules

        The only non-standard Perl module required by this module is

            Win32::WinError

        which is available from CPAN (http://www.cpan.org/).

INSTALLATION

    To install this module, cd to the directory that contains this INSTALL file
    and type the following:

        perl Makefile.PL
        nmake
        nmake test
        nmake install

    Use the appropriate program name instead of "nmake" in the above commands if
    your perl was built with a different make program.  To determine which make
    program was used to build your perl type the following:

        perl -V:make
