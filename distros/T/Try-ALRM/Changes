Revision history for Perl extension Try::ALRM. 

0.1  Wed Jul 13 11:05:09 2022
	- original version, released as 0.1
        - super basic unit test, will add more for bugs
          and regressions

0.2  Wed Jul 13 11:05:10 2022
        - added tests
        - fixed some POD

0.3  Wed Jul 13 11:05:11 2022
        - added some POD to acknowledge Try::Tiny's
          exported 'try' keyword and early thoughs
          regarding the clobbering of this keyword.
          The TLDR; is to not export Tiny::ALRM::try
          and to reference it using the full namespace.
        - added example script using both modules

0.4  Mon Jul 18 11:05:12 2022
        - refactor dispatch based on number of arguments
          passed to the 'try' method

0.5  Fri Jul 22 11:05:12 2022
        - added 'retry'
        - added 'finally'
        - changed form of trailing values (see POD),
          original method of setting timeout with a
          single undecorated value is no longer supported
        - added some more qualifying language in POD
          about the state of the module's keyword, "try".
        - module will mature over time, possibly with
          some breaking changes as assumptions are adjusted.

0.6  Tue Jul 26 11:05:12 2022
        - removed 'try' in favor of 'try_once'
        - 'try_once' is a wrapper around the reduced case of
          'retry' where 'tries => 1'
        - thanks to DCANTRELL for convincing me that 'try'
          should be something that doesn't conflict with
          Try::Tiny::try
