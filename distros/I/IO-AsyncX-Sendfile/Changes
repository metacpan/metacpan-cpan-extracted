Revision history for IO-AsyncX-Sendfile

0.002     2015-02-17 04:38:00+00:00 Europe/London
	Features:
	* Provides the string exception as the first parameter to ->fail() on failure,
	for consistency with other IO::Async components.

	Dependencies:
	* Attempt to prevent installation on windows - test reports contain "Attempt to free unreferenced scalar" errors even on the compilation tests, and I suspect the platform doesn't have the underlying API call anyway
