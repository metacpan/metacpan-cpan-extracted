Revision history for Audio::Scan

Note: Bug numbers refer to bugs at http://bugs.slimdevices.com

1.01    2018-07-09
        - Added Opus codec support. (Jeff Muizelaar)
        - ADTS: RT #124525, fixed incorrect duration calcuation due to off-by-one error
          in frame counter.
        - Added missing license meta name. (manwar)

1.00    2018-04-21
        - Fixed parsing of DSF files with more than 2 channels.

0.99    2017-11-24
        - Fixed a bug where an incorrect audio offset was returned when using
          NO_ARTWORK and reading a file with an ID3v2.2 or v2.3 unsynchronization bit
          set. The artwork in this type of file is only available when scanning in
          normal mode (without NO_ARTWORK).
        - Added id3_was_unsynced => 1 to the info section for v2.2/v2.3 files with the
          whole-tag unsync bit set. This type of tag is generally harmful to parser performance,
          so this flag might be useful if you want to find and upgrade this type of tag to v2.4.
        - DSF: WAV_BLOCK_SIZE was being used instead of DSF_BLOCK_SIZE. (Kimmo Taskinen)
        - ID3: Support for reading ID3 tags located >4GB into a file, such as in very large
          DSF files. (Kimmo Taskinen)
        - WavPack: Read correct samplerate and bits_per_sample for DSD files. (Kimmo Taskinen)
        - DSF/DFF: added bitrate to info hash.

0.98    2017-04-28
        - RT #119101, stop including MYMETA files in the tarball.

0.97    2017-04-27
        - WAV: GH #2, fixed an integer overflow error that could result in an incorrect song_length_ms
          for >16-bit files.

0.96    2016-11-21
        - Ogg: RT #118888, fixed crash when trying to read Vorbis comments in an
          incorrectly framed file with a bad terminal header page.
        - Removed hints/darwin.pl, don't try to be smarter than Perl about how to build things.
        - Fixed various minor compiler warnings output by the latest clang on macOS.

0.95    Unreleased community build
        - Improved DFF parsing for files which end with corrupted chunk. (Adrian Smith)
        - Improved ID3 support for DFF files. (Adrian Smith)

0.94    Unreleased community build
        - DSF/DFF: Support dsd file scanning for dsd and dsdiff files. (Kimmo Taskinen)
        - AIFF: Fixed scanning of 24 bit files. (Adrian Smith)

0.93    2011-09-14
        - ASF: Support seeking in a file without an ASF_Index object.
        - Don't use MAX_PATH because this limits path names to only 260 chars on Win32.

0.92    2011-09-09
        - Added $info->{jenkins_hash} which is a 32-bit hash value of the
          filename + mtime + file size.
        - MP4: Get correct HE-AAC samplerate values from esds.
        - ADTS AAC: Add support for .adts file extension.

0.91    2011-09-06
        - MP3, MP4, WMA, WAV, AIFF, ADTS AAC: Added DLNA audio profile detection as
          $info->{dlna_profile}.

0.90    2011-08-03
        - ID3: Bug 17392, fixed APIC offset calculation for non-MP3 files such as AIFF
          and WAV where the tag does not live at the front of the file.

0.89    2011-08-03
        - APE: Bug 15895, better handling if we have a broken APE tag and run out of
          tag data. (Adrian Smith)
        - WMA: Bug 17355, fixed WM/Picture offset calculation when artwork is stored in the
          Header Extension/Metadata Library block.
        - WMA: Added output warning when trying to seek in a file without ASF_Index.
        - Switched aac.t to Test::Warn instead of manual STDERR redirection.

0.88    2011-07-20
        - ADTS AAC: Check first 2-3 frames to avoid false syncs.
        - OSX: Xcode 4 doesn't include the 10.5 SDK, so check for this before using it.
        - Win32: Display better error messages when unable to read from files.
        - MP3, AAC, MPC: Bug 17173: Cleaned up several places where invalid memory reads could occur.

0.87    2011-03-21
        - AAC: Bug 16874, Fixed infinite loop that could occur when reading a truncated
          ADTS stream.
        - Win32: Fixed MSVC compilation error in mp3.c.

0.86    2011-03-18
        - MP3: Require first 3 frames to have matching samplerate and channel values.
        - MP3: Fixed bug where info->{vbr} would not be set if a file had a Xing frame
          but no LAME data.
        - MP3: Handle case where ID3 tag indicates an extended header is present but no
          actual header exists.

0.85    2010-09-08 23:40:00
        - Changed audio_md5 to use bytes from middle of file instead of the start,
          to reduce chance of false matches due to padding or silence.  Added new
          md5_offset option to override the default location used for MD5.
        - MP4: Fixed incorrect COVR_offset calculation.
        - FLAC: Fixed a bug where artwork could be seen as invalid if the picture header
          wasn't fully buffered.
        - FLAC: Use existing MD5 value if available for audio_md5.
        - FLAC, INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: info 'md5' value changed to 'audio_md5'.

0.84    2010-08-27 19:10:00
        - Added an optional audio_md5 info value, this is the MD5 checksum of the
          first N audio bytes of the file.  This is useful in determining if a file
          is the same even when tags have been changed.  See the documentation for details.
        - Added audio_size info value to all formats.
        - Added image offset values in AUDIO_SCAN_NO_ARTWORK mode for some formats, so
          image data may be extracted directly from the file if needed.  See the
          documentation for specific details.
        - AAC: Fixed samplerate values for AACplus files. The samplerate in the header
          needs to be doubled to obtain the actual playback samplerate.
        - ID3: Bug 16452, Don't add null strings as array entries for T* frames.

0.83    2010-06-10 14:15:00
        - APE: Tag could be ignored when ID3v1 tag is present.
        - Fixed error handling for invalid RVAD tags.
        - Win32: Added binmode for all open files and filehandles.

0.82    2010-05-24 13:15:00
        - RT 57664: ID3: Add checks to avoid reading too much inside an invalid frame.
        - FLAC: Seeking bug fixes.

0.81    2010-05-15 10:40:00
        - Fixed broken boolean values.

0.80    2010-05-14 23:15:00
        - ID3: Fixed unsynchronisation of v2.2/v2.3 tags.
        - FLAC: Fixed several seeking bugs and improved seeking algorithm.
        - MP3: Subtract LAME encoder delay/padding from total samples to obtain more
          accurate song duration value.

0.79    2010-04-27 14:30:00
        - ID3: Bug 16079, fixed crash when reading empty TCON tag.
        - Bug 16095, workaround Win32+filehandle bug where file pos could sometimes
          be off-by-one after a PerlIO_read.

0.78    2010-04-16 15:45:00
        - ASF: Fixed various issues when seeking, now uses the ASF_Index object correctly.
        - ASF: Refactored to clean up the code and make it more efficient.
        - ID3: Bug 16073, properly handle illegal zero-byte frames.

0.77    2010-04-14 11:30:00
        - PerlIO_seek with SEEK_END sometimes does not work correctly, changed all seeks
          to use SEEK_SET instead.

0.76    2010-04-14 10:30:00
        - APE: Bug 15992, fixed reading of APE tags when file also has a Lyricsv2 tag.
        - APE: Bug 16056, fixed reading of APE tags with certain kinds of invalid tags.

0.75    2010-04-02 15:50:00
        - ID3: Really fixed empty text field bug this time.

0.74    2010-04-02 12:15:00
        - ID3: Fixed bug where an empty text field could contain the text from the
          previous frame.

0.73    2010-03-31 12:30:00
        - Added find_frame_fh_return_info method for MP4 seeking from a filehandle.

0.72    2010-03-31 10:50:00
        - Fixed bug in reading unsynchronized APIC frames, the APIC data returned was not
          the correct size.
        - Fixed Mac hints file to work properly on OSX Server 10.6.

0.71    2010-03-30 00:00:00
        - Added find_frame_return_info method for MP4 that returns the seek offset as well
          as a rewritten header that can be placed before the seeked audio to construct a
          valid bitstream.

0.70    2010-03-23 19:00:00
        - Replaced libid3tag with a custom ID3 tag parser. libid3tag would read an entire
          tag into memory, so in files with large embedded artwork this was a huge waste
          of memory.  The new parser will generally never buffer more than about 4K of the
          file if AUDIO_SCAN_NO_ARTWORK is set.  It is also around twice as fast.
        - INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: ID3 tag elements returned in array form no longer include
          the encoding type as the first value in the array.  Common frames this affects
          include COMM, APIC, USLT, and others.
        - INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: find_frame for both MP3 and Ogg Vorbis now take a
          timestamp in milliseconds.  Seeking using a file offset is too ambiguous
          because of non-audio tag data.
        - Fixed minor bug in Ogg Vorbis bitrate calculation, it was not ignoring the
          size of the leading tag data when calculating average bitrate.
        - Improved Ogg Vorbis bitrate/duration calculation when file contains multiple
          logical bitstreams.
        - Added support for old WavPack versions < 4.
        - Changed ASF file_size value to be the actual file size, not the value from within
          the file metadata which may or may not be correct.
        - Bundled a win32 build of zlib to make compiling on Windows a bit easier.

0.62    2010-03-02 12:00:00
        - INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: Ogg Vorbis COVERART tags are now translated to an
          ALLPICTURES block and are base64-decoded.
        - Added support for new Ogg Vorbis cover art tag, METADATA_BLOCK_PICTURE. Data
          is returned in the same ALLPICTURES array as for FLAC.

0.61    2010-02-23 22:50:00
        - RT 53118: Fixed crash under Perl 5.11.
        - Updated Mac hints file to be more compatible with non-Apple Perl builds.

0.60    2010-02-22 17:45:00
        - WavPack 4.x support.
        - ID3: Bug 3998, Fixed parsing of multiple TCON genre values in older tag
          versions.
        - ID3: Parse RGAD frame (replay gain adjustment).
        - APE: Fixed bug where a trailing null could be read from tags.
        - FLAC: Calculate correct duration/bitrate for files with bad header
          information.
        - WAV: Ignore chunks SAUR, PAD, and otom.

0.59    2010-02-08 15:30:00
        - MP4: Bug 15656, read channels and bits_per_sample for ALAC files.
        - APE: Bug 15324, read APEv2 tags that don't contain a header.
        - APE: Fixed reading of binary tag data.
        - APE: Support for reading special "Cover Art (Front)" tag.

0.58    2010-01-28 12:30:00
        - MP4: Bug 15262, Don't overwrite song_length_ms from individual tracks if it was
          found in the mvhd box.

0.57    2010-01-12 21:40:00
        - Vorbis: Fixed parsing of files with large comment headers containing >128
          page segments.
        - Removed leading numbers from most tests, Schwern is right. :)
          http://use.perl.org/~schwern/journal/40054

0.56    2009-12-21 08:15:00
        - MP3: Bug 15197, fixed bitrate/duration calculation of MPEG-2 Layer 3 files.
        - MP3: RT 52932, fixed crash if seek fails while looking for APE tag.

0.55    2009-11-26 17:00:00
        - ID3: Bug 15196, fixed reading multiple TCON genre values.

        - FLAC: Fixed bug when seeking in a file containing artwork.
        - FLAC: Save memory by not buffering padding data.

0.53    2009-11-22 17:20:00
        - FLAC: Avoid wasting memory when reading picture block when
          AUDIO_SCAN_NO_ARTWORK is set.
        - Fixed Win32 compile issue.

0.52    2009-11-20 23:30:00
        - Bug 15115, ignore ID3 LINK frame data in latin1 list type.
        - libid3tag: Avoid wasting memory when AUDIO_SCAN_NO_ARTWORK is set and we're
          reading an APIC frame.
        - MP4: Refactored tag parser to avoid wasting memory on COVR tags when not
          reading artwork.
        - Various minor buffer optimizations to slightly reduce memory usage.

0.51    2009-11-16 15:10:00
        - Fixed compilation error under Windows.

0.50    2009-11-12 22:00:00
        - MP4: API change, avg_bitrate is now returned in the top-level info hash, not
          on a per-track basis.  This fixes some issues where tracks do not have an
          average bitrate value.
        - MP4: Read correct bits_per_sample value for secondary SLS track.

0.49    2009-11-09 09:00:00
        - Bug 15074, Fixed ASF GUID struct issues on some platforms.

0.48    2009-11-02 15:40:00
        - Fixed bug where AUDIO_SCAN_NO_ARTWORK didn't work properly when set to 0.

0.47    2009-11-02 14:00:00
        - If the AUDIO_SCAN_NO_ARTWORK environment variable is set, binary artwork tag
          data is instead replaced by the length of the artwork data.  This can save
          memory when scanning a lot of files with potentially large artwork.
        - Changed method on non-Windows platforms for determining file size to use
          stat instead of seek/tell.

0.46    2009-10-29 14:00:00
        - ID3: Change format of id3_version info field to list all versions of
          tags found in a file.
        - FLAC: Don't parse ID3 tags when using find_frame, in filehandle mode this
          caused a crash.
        - FLAC: Bug 14913, fixed error when calculating bitrate for large files.
        - WAV: Bug 14946, strip nulls from the end of LIST INFO tags.
        - MP4: Fixed error in avg_bitrate calculation for ALAC files.

0.45    2009-10-26 15:00:00
        - Bug 8380, Read multiple ID3 tags when more than one is found
          in a file, such as ID3v1 + ID3v2.
        - Fixed MP3 find_frame when looking for audio_offset + 1 and
          a Xing TOC is present.  Xing TOC is ignored for this special
          case.
        - Fixed FLAC find_frame when file has ID3v2 tags.
        - Bug 14883, added audio_size info to WAV and AIFF.
        - Fixed crash on invalid FLAC picture block.
        - Fixed bug in Ogg bitrate calculation.
        - Fixed tests to work on old Perls without Encode.
        - Max buffer size got accidentally reset to 10M in 0.44.
        - Added utility methods: get_types, extensions_for, type_for (Frank Terbeck)

0.44    2009-10-16 22:00:00
        - Bug 14788, ASF: Fixed crasher when reading multiple integer tags.
        - Changed Newx/Newxz calls to use older New/Newz API to support older Perls.

0.43    2009-10-16 15:00:00
        - Increase max buffer size yet again (to 20MB), this time someone had 16MB
          of artwork!
        - libid3tag: Don't re-generate frametype.c, compat.c, and genre.dat as this
          can fail if gperf is not available.

0.42    2009-10-13 10:45:00
        - Bug 14728, fixed issue in libid3tag where default ID3v2.3 UTF-16 byte
          order was set to big-endian instead of little-endian when no BOM
          was present.  Several other tag readers also default to little-endian
          so this appears to be the de-facto standard, even though the v2.3 spec
          says all Unicode text must have a BOM.
        - Bug 14705, Fixed libid3tag to return frames parsed so far when it runs into
          an invalid frame.
        - Bug 14658, MP4: fixed signed char issue on some PPC platforms.

0.41    2009-10-12 10:30:00
        - FLAC: Re-factored FLAC code to remove libFLAC dependency.
        - FLAC: API change: more accurate seeking via find_frame, which
          now takes an offset in milliseconds instead of bytes and seeks
          to the correct audio frame containing the desired sample.
        - FLAC: Added support for reading ID3v2 tags.
        - AIFF: Fixed error when reading ID3 chunks with a bad chunk size.
        - MP4: Fixed parsing of files with short TRKN fields.
        - MP4: Parse audio object type from esds box.
        - Vorbis: Added file_size to info.

0.40    2009-10-03 16:00:00
        - Bug 14462, fixed reading of WAV files with 18-byte fmt chunks.
        - WAV: Fixed reading of files with data chunks having the wrong size.
        - MP4: Fixed parsing of tags with duplicate keys containing integer
          values.

0.39    2009-10-01 16:00:00
        - Bug 14241, fixed Win32 crash when using find_frame on FLAC files.
        - Bug 14476, fixed crash when very large artwork is present (now supports
          tags up to 10M).
        - MP4: Fixed handling of cover art when multiple covers are present. Currently
          only the first cover image is returned.
        - Added is_supported($path) method. Can be used to determine if a given
          file can be scanned. (Frank Terbeck)

0.38    2009-09-22 13:00:00
        - Fixed crasher bug in average bitrate calculation logic.

0.37    2009-09-18 23:40:00
        - Minor fix to avoid an error being printed during bitrate calculation.

0.36    2009-09-18 23:30:00
        - Bug 13449, changed the way MP3 average bitrate calculation works. Read
          bitrate of all frames starting from the beginning of the file, bail out
          early if the file appears to be CBR.
        - Fixed a few bugs in the buffering code.

0.35    2009-09-17 15:00:00
        - WAV: added support for tags in an "ID3 " chunk.

0.34    2009-09-12 00:15:00
        - Bug 13995, fixed divide by zero error when trying to detect MP3 average
          bitrate on a file with no valid frames.

0.33    2009-09-11 22:15:00

0.31    2009-08-29 13:30:00
        - Allow static linking to a libFLAC that was built without
          Ogg support.
        - Change Snow Leopard hint to use 10.5 SDK and minimum version.

0.30    2009-08-27 00:15:00
        - Bug 8563, fixed parsing of MP4 sample rate.
        - Bug 13486, fixed parsing of MP4 files with multiple values for
          a single key.
        - Added Snow Leopard 64-bit universal binary support.

0.29    2009-08-07 16:00:00
        - Bug 13198, really fixed bad FLAC bitrate calculation on some
          files under Windows.

0.28    2009-08-06 19:00:00
        - Bug 13198, Changed the method for determining FLAC bitrate.

0.27    2009-07-26 23:00:00
        - Added support for Musepack SV8 files.
