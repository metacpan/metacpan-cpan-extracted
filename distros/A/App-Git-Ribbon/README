DESCRIPTION
    This Perl script helps you review the latest changes to a git
    repository.

MOTIVATION
    The way I used to review changes was by reading through the `git log`. I
    try to do this every morning at work to keep up with whats going on. But
    I was having a few problems:

    Its hard to know exactly which changes are new.
    I want to review commits in the order they happened (instead of most
    recent first).
    `git log` diff output can be hard to read and may not have enough
    context -- sometimes I want a side by side diff like I get from
    `vimdiff` or `git difftool`.

    Basically I wanted a quick and easy way to review the latest changes in
    a way that feels a little more like an RSS feed. So I wrote this script.

HOW TO USE IT
    First mark your place with

        git ribbon --save

    This will place a tag named _ribbon at origin/master. Basically we are
    bookmarking our current spot with a 'ribbon'.

    Next, pull down the latest changes made by your fellow conspirators from
    the remote repository.

        git pull

    To review those changes do the following:

        git ribbon

    After you have reviewed all the changes, mark your place again with:

        git ribbon --save

PRO TIPS
    In your .gitconfig add this:

        [diff]
            tool = vimdiff

    For more, read `git help difftool` and `git help config`.

    However the default colors for vimdiff were created by strange clowns.
    So try this instead:

        mkdir -p ~/.vim/colors/
        wget https://github.com/kablamo/dotfiles/blob/master/links/.vim/colors/iijo.vim -O ~/tmp/iijo.vim
        echo "colorscheme iijo" >> ~/.vimrc

    Then learn how to use vimdiff:

    To open and close folds type `zo` and `zo`. For more help type `:help
    fold-commands`.
    To switch windows type `ctl-w l` and `ctl-w h`. For more help type
    `:help window-move-cursor`.
    To quickly exit vimdiff type `ZZ`.

  Alternatives to vimdiff
    If you don't want to invest the time just yet to learn vim, use an
    alternative like meld, opendiff, p4merge, xxdiff, etc. Side by side
    diffs are worth it!

INSTALLATION
    cpanm <https://metacpan.org/module/App::cpanminus> is the standard tool
    the Perl community uses to download and install Perl libraries from the
    CPAN <https://metacpan.org/>. The following should get you up and
    running quickly:

        curl -L http://cpanmin.us | perl - --sudo App::cpanminus
        cpanm App::Git::Ribbon

SEE ALSO
    This script was inspired by a great blog post
    <http://gitready.com/advanced/2011/10/21/ribbon-and-catchup-reading-new-
    commits.html> on gitready.com which has a number of awesome git tricks
    for both beginners and advanced users.

    I also ended up writing a vim plugin
    <https://github.com/kablamo/vim-ribbon> that is probably better user
    experience if you very comfortable in vim.
