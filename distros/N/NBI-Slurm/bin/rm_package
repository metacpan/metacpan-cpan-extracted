=head1 NAME

rm_package - Remove a "package" in the NBI HPC that was installed using make_package

=head1 VERSION

version 0.14.0

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  rm_package PACKAGE_NAME [--remove] [--force]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This script safely removes packages that were previously installed using the make_package
script in the NBI HPC environment. It will remove both the binary file in the bin directory
and the package directory tree.

By default, the script runs in dry-run mode, which just lists the files that would be deleted
without performing any deletion. Use the --remove option to actually delete the files.

The script will check that all files to be deleted belong to the current user and will
not delete files owned by other users, even with --force.

=head1 NAME

rm_package - Remove packages installed with make_package

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<PACKAGE_NAME>

The name of the package to remove. Required.

=item B<--remove>, B<-r>

Actually remove the files. Without this option, the script runs in dry-run mode.

=item B<--force>, B<-f>

Skip the confirmation prompt when removing files. Still requires --remove to actually
delete files, and will still check file ownership.

=item B<--delete-image>, B<-i>

Also delete any Singularity image files referenced in the package.

=item B<--help>, B<-h>

Display this help message.

=back

=head1 EXAMPLES

To see what would be deleted without actually removing anything (dry-run mode):

  rm_package seqfu

To remove a package named "seqfu" with confirmation prompt:

  rm_package seqfu --remove

To force removal without confirmation:

  rm_package seqfu --remove --force
