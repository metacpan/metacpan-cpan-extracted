Revision history for Perl extension XML::Pastor 

1.0.4
	- Fixed an embarrassing bug where "xml_validate_further()" was misspelled in Type.pm (thanks to karlwb@gmail.com for the bug report #78956 on CPAN RT)
	- Fixed an undefined error in SimpleType.pm also thanks to thanks to karlwb@gmail.com for the bug report #78956 on CPAN RT
	- Fixed the infamous _sprint_xml_element misspelling bug. The provided workaround patch was not used. Instead, all references to _sprint_xml_element were replaced by sprint_xml_element in Schema::Parser.pm
	- Fixed a bug that caused attributeGroup refs not to be supported. Thanks to IKEGAMI for the patch on bug report #39691: An xs:attributeGroup can't contain an xs:attributeGroup ref
	- Fixed RT bug : #44760: Namespaces broken for xs:union memberTypes: By manually applying the patch proposed by IKEGAMI

	- Added support for simpleContent elements (those that a have a simple content but possibly with attributes).
	
0.54 Sat Jul 05 2008
	- Added some more examples to documentation. Also brought some clarity, hopefully. 
	- Fixed incorrect sprint_xml_element calls in XML::Pastor::Schema::Parser (it should have been imported from XML::Pastir::Util)

	- XML::Pastor::NodeArray->hash() can now accept CODE references as key fields. 
	- Attributes are now prefixed with an underscore '_' in the element hash. 
	  Attribute accessors follow the same pattern. However, non-prefixed accessor aliases
	  are provided when this doesn't conflict with a child element name.
