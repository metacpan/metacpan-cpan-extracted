 - Convert to Moo

1.003   2009-12-29
 - Entries now get a source element injected when they are added
   to the pipe. This is only marginally useful for non-atom feeds,
   but should allow tracing an entry back to its original source.
 - The source feature requires upgrading to XML::Atom 0.37 to fix
   an Atom bug.

 - RT 52449: Errant Build.PL script was not up to date. Removed.

 - Corrected README install instructions.
 - Fixed spurious test failures due to undeclared prerequisites
   in the test scripts.
