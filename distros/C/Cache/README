Readme for Cache

The Cache modules are designed to assist a developer in persisting data for a
specified period of time.  Often these modules are used in web applications to
store data locally to save repeated and redundant expensive calls to remote
machines or databases.

The Cache package provides the 'Cache' module, a generic interface for
creating persistent data stores.  The interface is implemented by the
Cache::Memory and Cache::File modules.

This work aggregates and extends the original Cache::Cache modules.

For more details, see the pod documentation in Cache.pm.

For licensing, see the LICENSE file in this distribution.
To install:

  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test
  sudo make install

will probably do it.
