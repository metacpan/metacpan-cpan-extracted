NAME
    Class::Accessor::FactoryTyped - Accessors whose values come from a
    factory

VERSION
    version 1.100970

SYNOPSIS
        package Person;
        use base 'Class::Accessor::FactoryTyped';

        __PACKAGE__->mk_factory_typed_accessors(
            'My::Factory',
            person_name    => 'name',
            person_address => 'address',
        );

DESCRIPTION
    This module generates accessors for your class in the same spirit as
    Class::Accessor does. While the latter deals with accessors for scalar
    values, this module provides accessor makers for arrays, hashes,
    integers, booleans, sets and more.

    As seen in the synopsis, you can chain calls to the accessor makers.
    Also, because this module inherits from Class::Accessor, you can put a
    call to one of its accessor makers at the end of the chain.

    The accessor generators also generate documentation ready to be used
    with Sub::Documentation.

METHODS
  mk_factory_typed_accessors
        MyClass->mk_factory_typed_accessors(
            'My::Factory',
            foo => 'phooey',
            bar => [ qw(bar1 bar2 bar3) ],
            baz => {
                slot => 'foo',
                comp_mthds => [ qw(bar baz) ]
            },
            fob => [
                {
                    slot       => 'dog',
                    comp_mthds => 'bark',
                },
                {
                    slot       => 'cat',
                    comp_mthds => 'miaow',
                },
            ],
        );

    This behaves a lot like "Class::Accessor::Complex"'s
    "mk_object_accessors()", but the types of objects - that is, their class
    names - that the generated accessors can take aren't given statically,
    but are determined by asking a factory.

    The factory class name must be the first argument. The class indicated
    should be a subclass of Class::Factory::Enhanced.

    The following argument is an array which should contain pairs of class
    => sub-argument pairs. The sub-arguments are parsed like this:

    Hash Reference
        See "baz()" above. The hash should contain the following keys:

        "slot"
            The name of the instance attribute (slot).

        "comp_mthds"
            A string or array reference, naming the methods that will be
            forwarded directly to the object in the slot.

    Array Reference
        As for "String", for each member of the array. Also works if each
        member is a hash reference (see "fob()" above).

    String
        The name of the instance attribute (slot).

    For each slot "x", with forwarding methods "y()" and "z()", the
    following methods are created:

    "x" A get/set method, see "*" below.

    "y" Forwarded onto the object in slot "x", which is auto-created via
        "new()" if necessary. The "new()", if called, is called without
        arguments.

    "z" As for "y".

    So, using the example above, a method, "foo()", is created, which can
    get and set the value of those objects in slot "foo", which will
    generally contain an object of the type the factory, in this case
    "My::Factory", uses for the object type "baz". Two additional methods
    are created named "bar()" and "baz()" which result in a call to the
    "bar()" and "baz()" methods on the "Baz" object stored in slot "foo".

    Apart from the forwarding methods described above,
    "mk_object_accessors()" creates methods as described below, where "*"
    denotes the slot name.

    "*" If the accessor is supplied with an object of an appropriate type,
        will set set the slot to that value. Else, if the slot has no value,
        then an object is created by calling "new()" on the appropriate
        class, passing in any supplied arguments.

        The stored object is then returned.

    *_clear, "clear_*"
        Removes the object from the accessor.

  mk_factory_typed_array_accessors
    Like "mk_factory_typed_accessors()" except creates array accessors with
    all methods like those generated by "Class::Accessor::Complex"'s
    "mk_array_accessors()".
