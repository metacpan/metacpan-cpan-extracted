0.09    2014-10-17 
        Minor changes to get unit tests to pass on smokers
        Added testing of env parameter for smartctl path, which will enable multi OS support
        Added COMPATABILITY pod section

0.08    2014-10-16 
        Corrected test data var name in new();        

0.07    2014-10-15
        Implemented dummy testing in unit tests to bypass the need for smokers having smartctl installed
        Regex and function cleanups
        Added run_short_test() to run the SMART short self test and unit tests for it

0.06    2014-10-09
        Fixed issue with N/A disk temp not returning correctly and causing failure

0.05    2014-10-08
        Separated out data processing from the getter methods. Getter methods now only return hash data.
        Added methods and unit tests for update_data() and get_disk_attributes(). update_data() can be called at any point in a calling script to update the drive data. This makes it where Disk::SMART can be used in a script called by cron, or a continuously running daemon.
        Updated MANIFEST to include LICENSE file
        Changes to satisfy perl critic
        Simplified get_disk_temp with substr to read the disk temp

0.04    2014-10-06
        Updated Makefile.PL to better interact with Meta::CPAN
        Updated pod for clarity

0.03    2014-10-04
        Added Math::Round to dependency list in Makefile.PL. Credit - Syohei YOSHIDA.
        Refactored methods to return N/A first before any further proessing is done
        Cleaned up unit tests
        get_disk_model() only outputs just the model information now.
        Added get_disk_errors()
        Methods now validate the device passed to it, to ensure smartctl has already read it
        Added unit tests to test passing invalid device to methods
        Changed to croak() as I didn't feel a trace was necessary with proper error returning

0.02    2014-10-03
        Added confess to new() in case smartctl cannot find the specified device

0.01    2014-10-03
        First version, released on an unsuspecting world.
