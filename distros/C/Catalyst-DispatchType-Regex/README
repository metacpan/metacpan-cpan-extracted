NAME
    Catalyst::DispatchType::Regex - Regex DispatchType

SYNOPSIS
    See Catalyst::DispatchType.

DESCRIPTION
    Status: Deprecated. Regex dispatch types have been deprecated and
    removed from Catalyst core. It is recommend that you use Chained methods
    or other techniques instead. As part of the refactoring, the dispatch
    priority of Regex vs Regexp vs LocalRegex vs LocalRegexp may have
    changed. Priority is now influenced by when the dispatch type is first
    seen in your application.

    When loaded, a warning about the deprecation will be printed to STDERR.
    To suppress the warning set the CATALYST_NOWARN_DEPRECATE environment
    variable to a true value.

    Dispatch type managing path-matching behaviour using regexes. For more
    information on dispatch types, see:

    *   Catalyst::Manual::Intro for how they affect application authors

    *   Catalyst::DispatchType for implementation information.

METHODS
  $self->list($c)
    Output a table of all regex actions, and their private equivalent.

  $self->match( $c, $path )
    Checks path against every compiled regex, and offers the action for any
    regex which matches a chance to match the request. If it succeeds, sets
    action, match and captures on $c->req and returns 1. If not, returns 0
    without altering $c.

  $self->register( $c, $action )
    Registers one or more regex actions for an action object. Also registers
    them as literal paths.

    Returns 1 if any regexps were registered.

  $self->register_regex($c, $re, $action)
    Register an individual regex on the action. Usually called from the
    register method.

  $self->uri_for_action($action, $captures)
    returns a URI for this action if it can find a regex attributes that
    contains the correct number of () captures. Note that this may function
    incorrectly in the case of nested captures - if your regex does
    (...(..))..(..) you'll need to pass the first and third captures only.
