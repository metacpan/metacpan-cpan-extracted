NAME
    Plack::Middleware::Debug::DBIProfile - DBI::Profile panel

VERSION
    version 0.102

SYNOPSIS
        enable 'Debug::DBIProfile'

    is the same as:

        enable 'Debug::DBIProfile', profile => 1;

    Using 1 is very cheap, hence the default, but you'll find "<profile ="
    2>> much more interesting!

DESCRIPTION
    Enables DBI::Profile on all DBI handles for the duration of the request.

    The "profile" parameter specifies the 'profile path'. It may be an
    integer or a string. The default is 1, which simply measures the time
    spent inside the DBI. For more detail try "<profile =" 2>> (or "<profile
    =" "!Statement">>) to get a per-statement breakdown. See "ENABLING A
    PROFILE" in DBI::Profile for more information.

    The Panel tab shows a summary of the profile data. For example:

        DBI Profile
        0.227 s (14%) #5

    Where 0.227 is the time spent within the DBI during this request. And
    "14%" is that time expressed as a percentage of the total time spent
    handling the request (from the perspective of this middleware). And the
    "#5" shows the number of items in the profile results, if greater than
    one. For example, with profile set to 2, the number reflects the number
    of distinct statements profiled.

    The Panel contents show the profile results.

NOTES
    Prior to DBI 1.616, using DBI profiling while also using DBI tracing
    with the "SQL" flag, you'll find extra "dbi_profile" lines will be
    written into the DBI log.
