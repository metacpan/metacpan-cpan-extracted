Revision history for Perl module Mojo::WebSocketProxy

0.11      2018-08-15 13:03:25+08:00 Asia/Manila
    - Fix test dependencies (switching from build phase,) adding Path::Tiny.

0.10      2018-08-14 12:40:37+08:00 Asia/Manila
    - Censor messages failing JSON decoding on Dispatcher::open_connection(),
      moving these from error logging to debug logging to prevent leaking
      private information, as well as dropping the WebSocket connection
      entirely.

0.09      2018-08-01 10:09:57+08:00 Asia/Manila
    - Fix character encoding issues on Dispatcher::open_connection() due
      to Mojo::Transaction::WebSockets emitting JSON-decoded `message` events;
      listen on `text` events instead, which pass raw WS_TEXT frames for
      decoding via JSON::MaybeUTF8
    - Relax Mojolicious dependency to >= 7.29
