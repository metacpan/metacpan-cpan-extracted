    this was deprecated and removed from Mojolicious a long
    time ago, and is being deprecated in Clustericious as well

1.19      2015-12-07 13:20:24 -0500
  - Reduce connect timeout in tests to keep test suite
    from being insanely slow on windows (gh#29)

1.18      2015-12-04 20:33:27 -0500
  - Test fixes in preperation for Clustericious 1.08
    URLs needed to be normalized in several places
    in the test suite.

1.17      2015-12-01 10:28:44 -0500
  - Compatability fixes for Clustericious::Log 1.06
  - Moved repository to clustericious org on github
    (updated meta appropriately)

1.16      2015-11-20 09:04:15 -0500
  - Migrate from JSON::XS to JSON::MaybeXS

1.15      2015-11-17 10:56:50 -0500
  - Fixed bug where failover_urls wasn't getting
    a default value in some cases in Yars::Client.

1.14      2015-11-13 12:39:42 -0500
  - Files can be downloaded to a scalar with
    Yars::Client#download, by passing a scalar reference
    as the last argument.
  - Error mssages are decoded correctly by the
    client (bug was introduced by incompatible changes
    in Mojolicious).
  - Yars::Client and yarsclient now have a persistent
    bucket cache (previously an in-memory only cache
    was used).  The cache is invalidated when the
    server detects the client has asked the wrong
    server to either upload or download a file.
  - Yars::Client#upload and "yarsclient upload" now
    take an optional pre-computed md5, which allows
    the client code to skip the computation.
  - The bundled examples have been cleaned up and
    verified to work with most recent versions of
    Yars and Clustericious.
  - Additional documentation improvements

1.12      2015-11-05 07:49:04 -0500
  - Added support for nginx X-Accel-Redirect
    by using the X-Yars-Use-X-Accel header
    (see Yars#EXAMPLES for example usage)
  - yars_fast_banace now accepts --help
    and --version like the other yars_*
    scripts
  - You can disable MD5 checks server side
    for download when using Yars::Client or
    yarsclient (which do a MD5 check client
    side after download) by using the 
    download_md5_verify server side
    configuration (see Yars#EXAMPLES for
    example usage).
  - Removed documentation for a "countent"
    subcommand for yarsclient which was 
    never implmeneted
  - Added a number of additional sanity
    checks for the 'yars configtest' command.
  - Fixed a Yars::Client / yarsclient bug
    where files stashed on a non-primary,
    non-failover host would not download
    correctly due to the client not correctly
    following redirects.
  - Much improved documentation.

    This includes writing to the disks tmp directory and checking that the

    used by Yars::Client manually by a human to check the health of the Yars
    cluster.
