        download-entities.pl:
        - Every download creates its own LWP::UserAgent object.
        Other ways seemed to lose the timeout setting on subsequent downloads
        in some configurations. (requested by Guillaume Protet)
        - Dependencies in Makefile now honor the transition from LWP::Simple to LWP::UserAgent;
        LWP::UserAgent's now call env_proxy to obey ENV proxy settings. (by Lloyd Parkes)
