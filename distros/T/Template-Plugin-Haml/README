NAME
    Template::Plugin::Haml - Haml plugin for Template Toolkit

VERSION
    version 0.1.2

SYNOPSIS
            [%- USE Haml -%]
            [%- FILTER haml -%]
            %p Hello World
            [%- END -%]

            <p>Hello World</p>

DESCRIPTION
    A thin wrapper around Text::Haml when you load the plugin it creates a
    filter called haml that you can use in a normal way. A full description
    of the Haml language can be found on the haml site
    <http://haml-lang.com>. Haml is a terse and whitespace sensitive html,
    xhtml, and xml templating system. Compared to Template Toolkit however
    it is relatively limited in what you can do. It by itself contains no
    includes, conditionals, or loop constructs. So I've combined it here
    with TT to make writing those kinds of templates with even less code
    easier.

  EXAMPLE
   input template
    wrapper.tt

            !!! 5
            %html
            [% content %]

    hello.tt

            [%- message='Hello World' %]
            [%- USE Haml -%]
            [%- WRAPPER wrapper.tt | haml -%]
            [%- FILTER haml -%]
             %head
              %meta{:charset => "utf-8"}
              %title hello
             %body
              %p [% message %]
              %ul
              [%- total=0; WHILE total < 5 %]
               %li [% total=total+1 %][% total %]
              [%- END -%]
            [%- END -%]

    I'd like to draw some attention to the while loop here you have to have
    the -'s in just the right spots to make it work because of Haml's
    whitespace sensitivity.

    It's also important to note that <tags> will be </closed> in the
    templates they're in. If you used PROCESS instead of WRAPPER above your
    template would be output like

            ...
            <html></html>
             <head>
            ...

    instead of...

   Output
            <!DOCTYPE html>
            <html>
             <head>
              <meta charset='utf-8' />
              <title>hello</title>
             </head>
             <body>
              <p>hello world</p>
              <ul>
               <li>1</li>
               <li>2</li>
               <li>3</li>
               <li>4</li>
               <li>5</li>
              </ul>
             </body>
            </html>

    <irc://irc.perl.org/tt> for helping me figure out why my first try
    didn't work
