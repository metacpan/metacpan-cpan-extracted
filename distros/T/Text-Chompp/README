NAME
    Text::Chompp - chomp and chop replacements that pass the changed
    value(s) back

VERSION
    version 0.001

SYNOPSIS
      use Text::Chompp qw/ chompp chopp /;
  
      ...
  
      # all the following work:
      my $chomped = chompp $string;
      my $chomped = chompp $_;
      my @chomped = map { chompp } @strings;
      my @chomped = chompp @strings;
  
      foreach (<FILE>) {
        chompp;
        push @chomped;
      }
   
      # ... etc ...

DESCRIPTION
    Alternative to the builtins "chop" and "chomp", which leave the original
    intact, and instead return the altered value. The intention is to take
    the same arguments as the originals.

LIMITATIONS
    Text::Chompp will not process the values of hashes (as chop/chomp do).

SEE ALSO
    Text::Chomped - requires alternative syntax for lists
