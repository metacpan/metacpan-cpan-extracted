NAME

    Alt::Alien::cmake3::System - Simplified alternative to Alien::cmake3
    that uses system cmake

VERSION

    version 0.0402

SYNOPSIS

     env PERL_ALT_INSTALL=OVERWRITE cpanm -n Alt::Alien::cmake3::System

DESCRIPTION

    This distribution provides an alternative implementation of
    Alien::cmake3 that only works with a system cmake. It is intended for
    testing the core of Alien::Build, which includes optional tests that
    use Alien::cmake3. The problem with using the real Alien::cmake3 for
    testing the core of Alien::Build in CI is that Alien::cmake3 also
    depends on Alien::Build. This module may also be useful for system
    integrators, although I discourage it for that use, as this module may
    not be as well supported as the real Alien::cmake3.

CAVEATS

    The tests use Test::Alien which is now part of the same distribution as
    Alien::Build, so you have the same chicken and egg problem. It is
    recommended to use the -n option on cpanm to skip the testing phase.
