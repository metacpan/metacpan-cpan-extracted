NAME
    Set::Array - Arrays as objects with lots of handy methods (including Set
    comparisons) and support for method chaining.

SYNOPSIS
    "my $sao1 = Set::Array->new(1,2,4,"hello",undef);"

    "my $sao2 = Set::Array->new(qw(a b c a b c));"

    "print $sao1->length; # prints 5"

    "$sao2->unique->length->print; # prints 3"

PREREQUISITES
    Perl 5.6 or later

    The 'Want' module by Robin Houston. Available on CPAN.

DESCRIPTION
    Set::Array allows you to create arrays as objects and use OO-style
    methods on them. Many convenient methods are provided here that appear
    in the FAQ's, the Perl Cookbook or posts from comp.lang.perl.misc. In
    addition, there are Set methods with corresponding (overloaded)
    operators for the purpose of Set comparison, i.e. +, ==, etc.

    The purpose is to provide built-in methods for operations that people
    are always asking how to do, and which already exist in languages like
    Ruby. This should (hopefully) improve code readability and/or
    maintainability. The other advantage to this module is method-chaining
    by which any number of methods may be called on a single object in a
    single statement.

OBJECT BEHAVIOR
    The exact behavior of the methods depends largely on the calling
    context.

    Here are the rules:

    * If a method is called in void context, the object itself is modified.

    * If the method called is not the last method in a chain (i.e. it's
    called in object context), the object itself is modified by that method
    regardless of the 'final' context or method call.

    * If a method is called in list or scalar context, a list or list
    refererence is returned, respectively. The object itself is NOT
    modified.

    Here's a quick example:

    "my $sao = Set::Array->new(1,2,3,2,3);" "my @uniq = $sao->unique(); #
    Object unmodified. '@uniq' contains 3 values." "$sao->unique(); # Object
    modified, now contains 3 values"

    Here are the exceptions:

    * Methods that report a value, such as boolean methods like *exists()*
    or other methods such as *at()* or *as_hash()*, never modify the object.

    * The methods *clear()*, *delete()*, *delete_at()*, and *splice* will
    always modify the object. It seemed much too counterintuitive to call
    these methods in any context without actually
    deleting/clearing/substituting the items!

    * The methods *shift()* and *pop()* will modify the object AND return
    the value that was shifted or popped from the array. Again, it seemed
    much too counterintuitive for something like "$val = $sao->shift" to
    return a value while leaving the object's list unchanged. If you really
    want the first or last value without modifying the object, you can
    always use the *first()* or *last()* method, respectively.

    * The *join()* method always returns a string and is really meant for
    use in conjunction with the *print()* method.

BOOLEAN METHODS
    exists(*val*) - Returns 1 if *val* exists within the array, 0 otherwise.
    If no value (or *undef*) is passed, then this method will test for the
    existence of undefined values within the array.

    is_empty() - Returns 1 if the array is empty, 0 otherwise. Empty is
    defined as having a length of 0.

STANDARD METHODS
    at(*index*) - Returns the item at the given index (or *undef*). A
    negative index may be used to count from the end of the array. If no
    value (or *undef*) is specified, it will look for the first item that is
    not defined.

    clear() - Empties the array (i.e. length becomes 0). You may pass a '1'
    to this method to set each element of the array to *undef* rather than
    truly empty it.

    compact() - Removes undefined elements from the array.

    count(*?val?*) - Returns the number of instances of *val* within the
    array. If *val* is not specified (or is *undef*), the method will return
    the number of undefined values within the array.

    delete(*list*) - Deletes all items within *list* from the array that
    match. This method will crash if *list* is not defined. If your goal is
    to delete undefined values from your object, use the *compact()* method
    instead.

    delete_at(*index, ?index?*) - Deletes the item at the specified index.
    If a second index is specified, a range of items is deleted. You may use
    -1 or the string 'end' to refer to the last element of the array.

    fill(*val,?start?,?length?*) - Sets the selected elements of the array
    (which may be the entire array) to *val*. The default value for start is
    0. If length is not specified the entire array, however long it may be
    at the time of the call, will be filled. Alternatively, a quoted integer
    range may be used.

    e.g. "$sao->fill('x','3-5');"

    The array length/size may not be expanded with this call - it is only
    meant to fill in already-existing elements.

    first() - Returns the first element of the array (or undef).

    flatten() - Causes a one-dimensional flattening of the array,
    recursively. That is, for every element that is an array (or hash, or a
    ref to either an array or hash), extract its elements into the array.

    e.g. "my $sa = Set::Array->new([1,3,2],{one=>'a',two=>'b'},x,y,z);"

    "$sao->flatten->join(',')->print; # prints "1,3,2,one,a,two,b,x,y,z""

    foreach(*sub ref*) - Iterates over an array, executing the subroutine
    for each element in the array. If you wish to modify or otherwise act
    directly on the contents of the array, use $_ within your sub reference.

    e.g. To increment all elements in the array by one...

    "$sao->foreach(sub{ ++$_ });"

    get - Alias for the indices() method.

    index(*val*) - Returns the index of the first element of the array
    object that contains *val*. Returns *undef* if no value is found.

    Note that there is no dereferencing here so if you're looking for an
    item nested within a ref, use the *flatten* method first.

    indices(*val1,?val2?, ?val...?*) - Returns an array consisting of the
    elements at the specified indices or *undef* if the element is out of
    range.

    A range may also be used. It must be a quoted string in '0..3' format.

    join(*?char?*) - Joins the individual elements of the list into a single
    string with the elements separated by the value of *char*. Useful in
    conjunction with the *print()* method. If no character is specified,
    then *char* defaults to a comma.

    e.g. "$sao->join('-')->print;"

    last() - Returns the last element of the array (or *undef*).

    length() - Returns the number of elements within the array.

    max() - Returns the maximum value of an array. No effort is made to
    check for non-numeric data.

    pack(*template*) - Packs the contents of the array into a string (in
    scalar context) or a single array element (in object or void context).

    pop() - Removes the last element from the array. Returns the popped
    element.

    print(*?1?*) - Prints the contents of the array. If a '1' is provided as
    an argument, the output will automatically be terminated with a newline.

    This also doubles as a 'contents' method, if you just want to make a
    copy of the array, e.g. my @copy = $sao->print;

    Can be called in void or list context, e.g.

    "$sao->print(); # or..." "print "Contents of array are: ",
    $sao->print();"

    push(*list*) - Adds *list* to the end of the array, where *list* is
    either a scalar value or a list. Returns an array or array reference in
    list or scalar context, respectively. Note that it does not return the
    length in scalar context. Use the *length* method for that.

    reverse() - Reverses the order of the contents of the array.

    rindex(*val*) - Similar to the 'index()' method, except that it returns
    the index of the last *val* found within the array.

    set(*index*,*value*) - Sets the element at *index* to *value*, replacing
    whatever may have already been there.

    shift() - Shifts the first element of the array and returns the shifted
    element.

    sort(*?coderef?*) - Sorts the contents of the array in alphabetical
    order, or in the order specified by the optional *coderef*. Use your
    standard *$a* and *$b* variables within your calling program, e.g:

    "my $sao = Set::Array->new( { name => 'Berger', salary => 20000 }, {
    name => 'Berger', salary => 15000 }, { name => 'Vera', salary => 25000
    }, );"

    "my $subref = sub{ $b->{name} cmp $a->{name} || $b->{salary} <=>
    $a->{salary} };"

    "$sao14->sort($subref)->flatten->join->print(1);"

    splice(*?offset?,?length?,?list?*) - Splice the array starting at
    position *offset* up to *length* elements, and replace them with *list*.
    If no list is provided, all elements are deleted. If length is omitted,
    everything from *offset* onward is removed.

    Returns an array or array ref in list or scalar context, respectively.
    This method always modifies the object, regardless of context. If your
    goal was to grab a range of values without modifying the object, use the
    *indices* method instead.

    unique() - Removes/returns non-unique elements from the list.

    unshift(*list*) - Prepends a scalar or list to array. Note that this
    method returns an array or array reference in list or scalar context,
    respectively. It does not return the length of the array in scalar
    context. Use the *length* method for that.

ODDBALL METHODS
    as_hash() - Returns a hash based on the current array, with each even
    numbered element (including 0) serving as the key, and each odd element
    serving as the value. This can be switched by using the *key_order*
    option and setting it to 'odd', in which case the even values serve as
    the values, and the odd elements serve as the keys. The default is
    *even*.

    Of course, if you don't care about insertion order, you could just as
    well do something like, "$sao-"reverse->as_hash;>

    Dies if the array contains an odd number of elements. This method does
    not actually modify the object itself in any way. It just returns a
    plain hash in list context or a hash reference in scalar context. The
    reference is not blessed, therefore if this method is called as part of
    a chain, it must be the last method called.

    impose(*?append/prepend?*,*string*) - Appends or prepends the specified
    string to each element in the array. Specify the method by using either
    the keyword 'append' or 'prepend'. The default is 'append'.

    randomize() - Randomizes the order of the elements within the array.

    rotate(*direction*) - Moves the last item of the list to the front and
    shifts all other elements one to the right, or vice-versa, depending on
    what you pass as the direction - 'ftol' (first to last) or 'ltof' (last
    to first). The default is 'ltof'.

    e.g. my $sao = Set::Array->new(1,2,3);

    $sao->rotate(); # order is now 3,1,2

    $sao->rotate('ftol'); # order is back to 1,2,3

OVERLOADED (COMPARISON) OPERATORS
  General Notes

    For overloaded operators you may pass a Set::Array object, or just a
    normal array reference (blessed or not) in any combination, so long as
    one is a Set::Array object. You may use either the operator or the
    equivalent method call.

    Examples (using the '==' operator or 'is_equal' method):

    my $sao1 = Set::Array->new(1,2,3,4,5); my $sao2 =
    Set::Array->new(1,2,3,4,5); my $ref1 = [1,2,3,4,5];

    if($sao1 == $sao2)... # valid if($sao1 == $ref1)... # valid if($ref1 ==
    $sao2)... # valid if($sao1->is_equal($sao2))... # valid
    if($sao1->is_equal($ref1))... # valid

    All of these operations return either a boolean value (for equality
    operators) or an array (in list context) or array reference (in scalar
    context).

    & or bag - The union of both sets, including duplicates.

    - or difference - Returns all elements in the left set that are not in
    the right set.

    == or is_equal - This tests for equality of the content of the sets,
    though ignores order. Thus, comparing (1,2,3) and (3,1,2) will yield a
    *true* result.

    != or not_equal - Tests for inequality of the content of the sets.
    Again, order is ignored.

    * or intersection - Returns all elements that are common to both sets.

    % or symmetric_difference - Returns all elements that are in one set or
    the other, but not both. Opposite of intersection.

    + or union - Returns the union of both sets. Duplicates excluded.

EXAMPLES
    For our examples, I'll create 3 different objects

    my $sao1 = Set::Array->new(1,2,3,a,b,c,1,2,3); my $sao2 =
    Set::Array->new(1,undef,2,undef,3,undef); my $sao3 =
    Set::Array->new(1,2,3,['a','b','c'],{name=>"Dan"});

    How do I...

    *get the number of unique elements within the array?*

    "$sao1->unique()->length();"

    *count the number of non-undef elements within the array?*

    "$sao2->compact()->length();"

    *count the number of unique elements within an array, excluding undef?*

    "$sao2->compact()->unique()->length();"

    *print a range of indices?*

    "$sao1->indices('0..2')->print();"

    *test to see if two Set::Array objects are equal?*

    "if($sao1 == $sao2){ ... }"

    "if($sao1->is_equal($sao2){ ... } # Same thing"

    *fill an array with a value, but only if it's not empty?*

    "if(!$sao1->is_empty()){ $sao1->fill('x') }"

    *shift an element off the array and return the shifted value?*

    "my $val = $sao1->shift())"

    *shift an element off the array and return the array?*

    "my @array = $sao1->delete_at(0)"

    *flatten an array and return a hash based on now-flattened array?, with
    odd elements as the key?*

    "my %hash = $sao3->flatten()->reverse->as_hash();"

    *delete all elements within an array?*

    "$sao3->clear();"

    "$sao3->splice();"

    *modify the object AND assign a value at the same time?*

    "my @unique = $sao1->unique->print;"

KNOWN BUGS
    There is a bug in the *Want-0.05* module that currently prevents the use
    of most of the overloaded operators, though you can still use the
    corresponding method names. The equality operators == and != should
    work, however.

FUTURE PLANS
    Anyone want a built-in 'permute()' method?

    I'm always on the lookout for faster algorithms. If you've looked at the
    code for a particular method and you know of a faster way, please email
    me. Be prepared to backup your claims with benchmarks (and the benchmark
    code you used). Tests on more than one operating system are preferable.
    No, *map* is not always faster - *foreach* loops usually are in my
    experience.

    More flexibility with the foreach method (perhaps with iterators?).

    Ultimately, I want to create a Set::Hash and Set::String module (both
    already in the works) and have all three modules bundled together. Then,
    whenever I return a string or a hash (instead of an array), I return
    them as objects, allowing you to continue method chaining no matter what
    type of data is returned, using methods appropriate for the return type.

    This probably means a major re-write using a virtual class, but the API
    probably won't change for the subclasses.

THANKS
    Thanks to all the kind (and sometimes grumpy) folks at
    comp.lang.perl.misc who helped me with problems and ideas I had.

    Thanks also to Robin Houston for the 'Want' module! Where would method
    chaining be without it?
