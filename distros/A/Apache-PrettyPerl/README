Apache::PrettyPerl - Apache mod_perl PerlHandler for nicer output perl files 
in the client's browser. For more information see Apache::PrettyPerl home
page http://amk.lg.ua/~ra/PrettyPerl/

To install, first install mod_perl (see http://perl.apache.org).
Then cd to the directory that contains this README file 
and type the following:

    perl Makefile.PL

If you wish to install this bundle somewhere other than the default
location then type something like:

    perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/home/me/perl

Then to build run make

    make

If you have write access to the install directory (or the one
specified by PREFIX) then you can now type:

    make install

Presuming that the install target is in your PERL5LIB path then you
are now ready to use Apache::PrettyPerl. Configurate your apache as 
it described in the man page. 
Enjoy!
