NAME
    McBain::WithGearmanXS - Load a McBain API as a Gearman worker

SYNOPSIS
            # write your API as you normally would, and create
            # a simple start-up script:

            #!/usr/bin/perl -w

            use warnings;
            use strict;
            use MyAPI -withGearmanXS;

            MyAPI->work('localhost', 4730);

DESCRIPTION
    "McBain::WithGearmanXS" turns your McBain API into a Gearman worker,
    making it easy to consume your APIs with Gearman clients.

    When your API is loaded, this module will traverse its routes, and
    create a queue for each methods found. So, for example, if your API
    looks like this...

            package MyAPI;

            use McBain;

            get '/multiply' => (
                    ...
            );

            post '/divide' => (
                    ...
            );

    ...then the following queues will be created:

            GET:/multiply
            POST:/divide

    The workers created receive payloads in JSON format, and convert them
    into the hash-refs your API's methods expect to receive. Results are
    sent back to the clients in JSON as well. Note that if an API method
    does not return a hash-ref, this runner module will automatically turn
    it into a hash-ref to ensure that conversion into JSON will be possible.
    The created hash-ref will have one key - holding the method's name, with
    whatever was returned from the method as its value. For example, if
    method "GET:/divide" in topic "/math" returns an integer (say 7), then
    the client will get the JSON "{ "GET:/math/divide": 7 }".

  CAVEATS
    There are some disadvantages to using this runner:

    *   Since a queue is created for every route and method in the API,
        "McBain" cannot intercept calls to routes that do not exist.

    *   You can't use regular expressions when defining queues. Well, you
        can, but they won't work.

    *   Gearman provides no way of providing a detailed error message when
        jobs fail, therefore all "McBain" can do is indicate that the job
        has failed and no more.

    The first two I hope to overcome in a next version, or even a different
    runner, by creating just one queue that simply forwards the requests to
    "McBain".

METHODS EXPORTED TO YOUR API
  work( [ $host, $port ] )
    Connects the Gearman worker created by the module to the Gearman server
    running at the host and port provided. If none are provided, "localhost"
    and 4730 are used, respectively.

    The method never returns, so that the worker listens for jobs
    continuously.

METHODS REQUIRED BY MCBAIN
    This runner module implements the following methods required by
    "McBain":

  init( )
    Creates the "work( $host, $port )" method for the root topic of the API.

  generate_env( $job )
    Receives the Gearman::XS::Job object and creates "McBain"'s standard env
    hash-ref from it.

  generate_res( $env, $res )
    Converts the result from an API method in JSON. Read the discussion
    under "DESCRIPTION" for more info.

  handle_exception( $err, $job )
    Simply calls "$job->send_fail" to return a job failed status to the
    client.

CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT
    No configuration files are required.
