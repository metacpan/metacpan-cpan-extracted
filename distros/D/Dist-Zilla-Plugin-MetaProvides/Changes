2.002004 2017-03-01T11:57:55Z fd9040a
 [Bugfix]

 - Closes https://github.com/kentnl/Dist-Zilla-Plugin-MetaProvides/issues/7

 [Dependencies::Stats]
 - Dependencies changed since 2.002003, see misc/*.deps* for details
 - develop: +1 ↑1

2.002003 2016-07-29T22:25:40Z c9860d3
 - STABLE: This release includes all changes previously stated between 2.002000 and 2.002000 as stable.
 - SHORTLIST: Better logging about possible issues, Fewer dependencies, Enhanced metaconfig data, MetaNoIndex
   application now correct.

 [Dependencies::Stats]
 - Dependencies changed since 2.002002, see misc/*.deps* for details
 - develop: (suggests: ↑1)

2.002002 2016-07-07T11:55:30Z 2a9e822
 - Adds logging warnings for Provides entries that don't map to shipped files. This should not be a problem for anyone
   unless you're using custom MetaProvides.
 - Warn about cuckooed packages at the "provides-to-dzil" level. This enables automatic exposure of all packages where
   "$filename" !~ "/Module/Name.pm" as being potentially problematic.

 [Dependencies::Stats]
 - Dependencies changed since 2.002001, see misc/*.deps* for details
 - test: +1

2.002001 2016-06-29T06:09:34Z 2be5312
 - Remove usage of ConfigDumper and inline dump_config code instead.
 - use '$' on front of role-injected '$VERSION' identifier to be clearer.
 - Remove usage of my dztest testing util.

 [Dependencies::Stats]
 - Dependencies changed since 2.002000, see misc/*.deps* for details
 - runtime: -1
 - test: +1 -1 (recommends: +1)

2.002000 2016-04-22T14:20:31Z 8cd4f33
 - IMPORTANT: Previously, MetaNoIndex compatibility implemented the "namespace" feature in contradiction of
   https://metacpan.org/pod/CPAN::Meta::Spec#namespace , which means packages that exactly matched the "namespace"
   token were excluded, when they should have not been excluded. This release resolves this issue, as reported at
   https://github.com/rjbs/Dist-Zilla/issues/204

1.12044806 2010-11-06T18:20:55Z
 - A little bit more testing of the codebase, tests should be now comprehensive enough to detect most change-bugs.

 [Dependencies::Stats]
 - Dependencies changed since 1.12044803, see misc/*.deps* for details
 - test: +1

1.12044803 2010-11-06T15:26:58Z

 - Dependencies changed since 1.12044518, see misc/*.deps* for details
 - develop: +2
 - runtime: (suggests: +1)
 - test: (suggests: +1)

1.12044518 2010-11-04T06:32:54Z
 - Spliced Test deps into its own module.
 - Shipped work behind _try_regen_metadata to Dist::Zilla::Util::EmulatePhase
 - meta_noindex is now *ON* by default. This behavioural change is reason for Bumping the minor to 12. Rationale: If
   you're using MetaNoIndex and this module, then you want things to get skipped. With provides =>, cpan won't do any
   indexing itself, so no_index in the data does nothing. So, this module brings that power back to life by
   implementing it manually.
 - Add thanks while I remember.

 - Dependencies changed since 1.11044405, see misc/*.deps* for details

1.11044404 2010-11-02T16:25:56Z
 - Upgrade to recent @KENTNL changes ( remove inc/ and xt/ from source tree, relocate perlcritic.rc )
 - Now have a convenience function, usable by all consuming roles that permit filtering packages that match criteira
   added to MetaNoIndex. Once your role uses this function, the attribute also bolted on by this change ( meta_noindex
   = 1 ) will control this behaviour. Thanks to xdg/David Golden for this suggestion.

   ::Plugin::MetaProvides::FromFile
