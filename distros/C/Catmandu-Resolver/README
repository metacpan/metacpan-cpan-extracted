DESCRIPTION

    Configure the Resolver <https://github.com/PACKED-vzw/resolver> as a
    store <http://librecat.org/Catmandu/#stores> for Catmandu.

    Museum objects and records require a PID to be uniquely identifiable.
    The Resolver tool generates and resolves these PIDs. By using this
    store, PIDs can be queried (based on the object number of the record as
    stored in the resolver), created, updated and deleted from Catmandu.
