Template-Recall
============================

Template::Recall works using a "reverse callback" approach. A "callback"
templating system (i.e. Mason, Apache::ASP) generally includes template
markup and code in the same file. The template "calls" out to the code
where needed. Template::Recall works in reverse. Rather than inserting
code inside the template, the template remains separate, but broken into
sections. The sections are called from within the code at the
appropriate times.

A template section is merely a file on disk (or a "marked" section in a
single file). The render() method is used to "call" out to the template
sections. Simply create a hash of name/value pairs that represent the
template tags you wish to replace, and pass it along with the template
section, i.e.

        $tr->render('prodrow', \%h);
