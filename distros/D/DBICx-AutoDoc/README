NAME
    DBICx::AutoDoc - Generate automatic documentation of DBIx::Class::Schema
    objects

SYNOPSIS
    The recommended way to use this package is with the command-line tool
    dbicx-autodoc. You should check it's documentation for more details.

      use DBICx:::AutoDoc;
  
      my $ad = DBICx:::AutoDoc->new(
        schema  => 'MyApp::DB',
        output  => '/tmp',
      );
      $ad->fill_template( 'html' );

DESCRIPTION
    DBICx::AutoDoc is a utility that can automatically generate
    documentation for your DBIx::Class schemas. It works by collecting
    information from several sources and arranging it into a format that
    makes it easier to deal with from templates.

CONFIGURATION METHODS
  new( %configuration )
    Create a new DBICx::AutoDoc object. Most of the methods below can also
    be passed to the constructor as configuration options. Which means that
    these two techniques are identical:

      # pass options to constructor
      my $ad = DBICx::AutoDoc->new( schema => 'MyApp::DB' );
  
      # create object, then configure it
      my $ad = DBICx::AutoDoc->new();
      $ad->schema( 'MyApp::DB' );

  schema( $schema );
    Retrieve or set the class name of the DBIx::Class::Schema class you want
    to document.

  output( $directory );
    Retrieve or change the directory where the generated documentation will
    be placed. This directory will be created for you if it doesn't exist.
    The default is to put the output files in the current directory.

  connect( $true_or_false);
    The connect method allows you to specify whether an attempt will be made
    to connect to the actual database. If given a false value (the default)
    the documentation will be generated from only the code of your packages.
    If true, then "$schema-"connect> will be called before the documentation
    process begins (which means you may also have to set the "dsn", "user"
    and/or "pass" options.)

    The default is not to attempt to connect, which gives you documentation
    of the classes, rather than the database itself.

    Note that there are several parts of the documentation which may change,
    depending on whether you are connected or not, as some parts of your
    code may get modified by the database. As an example, when deploying to
    a PostgreSQL database, you might specify the data_type for your columns
    as 'varchar', but if you use the "connect" option, then the value
    reported by the database will probably be 'character varying' instead.

  dsn( $dsn );
    Retrieve or change the DSN for the database. Might be included in the
    documenation (some templates display this value, some don't) but if
    "connect" is false, then it won't be used for anything other than
    displaying in the documentation.

  user( $username );
    Get or set the username used to connect to the database. Ignored if
    "connect" is false.

  pass( $password );
    Get or set the password used to connect to the database. Ignored if
    "connect" is false.

  include_path( $scalar_or_array_ref );
    Get or set the value passed to Template's INCLUDE_PATH option. Unless
    you are making your own templates, you probably don't need to change
    this.

    The default is to look in the DBICx::AutoDoc 'auto' directory, which is
    where they get installed by Module::Install, and if not found there, to
    look in "$FindBin::Bin/templates", which allows you to use the
    dbicx-autodoc tool from an uninstalled copy of the package.

METHODS
  filename_base
    Returns a base filename for the output files. By default this is based
    on the class name and version number of your schema. For example, if you
    schema looks like this:

      package MyApp::DB::Schema;
      use base qw( DBIx::Class::Schema );
      our $VERSION = 42;

    Then filename_base will return 'MyApp-DB-Schema-42'.

    When a template is processed, the extension for the template is appended
    to the output from this method to determine the output filename.

  output_filename( $extension );
    Given an extension, this method returns the filename that should be used
    for storing the output of the template associated with that extension.
    For example, using the previous example schema, if "output_filename(
    'html' )" is called, it would return 'MyApp-DB-Schema-42.html'. When
    processing a template, this filename will be created in the directory
    specified by the "output" option.

  fill_template( $extension );
    The "fill_template" method takes an argument of the file extension
    (which is also the template name) and renders that template into an
    appropriately named file in the output directory.

  fill_templates( @templates );
    This is simply a convenience method that calls fill_template for each of
    the templates indicated.

  fill_all_templates
    Calling the "fill_all_templates" method is simply a convenience wrapper
    that calls "list_templates" to determine what templates are available,
    and then calls "fill_template" for each one in turn, thereby generating
    all the possible documentation for your schema.

  list_templates
    Returns a list of all the templates that are found in the
    "include_path". Names from this list can be passed to "fill_template" to
    genrate that documentation.

INTERNAL METHODS
    These methods are generally used only internally, but are documented for
    completeness.

  byname
    A sort routine for sorting an array of hashrefs by the 'name' key.

  default_include_path
    A class method that calculates and returns the default value for the
    include_path.

  find_template_file
    Given the name of a template, returns the full path to the file
    containing that template.

  generated
    Returns a timestamp that is used for the 'Generated at' line at the
    bottom of the html output files.

  get_columns_for( $source )
    Given a source name, returns the column information for the columns
    associated with that source (as an array of hashrefs.)

  get_relationships_for( $source )
    Given a source name, returns the relationship information for the
    relations associated with that source (as an array of hashrefs.)

  get_simple_moniker_for( $source )
    Given a source name, this method simply returns a simplified version of
    the name that has runs of non-word characters replaced with an
    underscore ("s/\W+/_/g") and has a number appended if two source names
    would otherwise reduce to the same (such as Foo-Bar and Foo::Bar.) The
    simplified moniker is used in some places where the non-word characters
    would otherwise cause problems (primarily in the GraphViz object names.)

  get_unique_constraints_for( $source )
    Given a source name, returns the unique constraints for that source (as
    an array of hashrefs.)

  get_vars
    Assembles the output of all the data collection methods into a structure
    suitable for passing to Template.

  inheritance
    Returns a structure indicating the inheritance heirarchy of the classes
    used in the schema.

  relationship_map
    Assembles the output from the various relationship collecting methods
    into a format more useful for charting and graphing. Returns an arrayref
    of hashrefs.

  schema_class
    Returns the name of the DBIx::Class::Schema subclass.

  schema_version
    Returns the version of the DBIx::Class::Schema subclass. If the package
    doesn't define a version, it is assumed to be version 1.

  software_versions
    Returns a hashref of packages and their versions, mostly useful for
    debugging. Includes the versions of DBICx::AutoDoc,
    DBICx::AutoDoc::Magic, DBIx::Class, and Template.

  sources
    Returns an arrayref of hashrefs containing information about each source
    defined in the schema.

TEMPLATES
    The templates used by this module are processed with the Template
    package. The template filename is the name the output file should have,
    with the word 'AUTODOC' in place of the generated name. Templates found
    in the "include_path" that start with 'AUTODOC' are assumed to be
    top-level templates, and can be passed to "fill_template" and will be
    included in the list returned by "list_templates". Templates that do not
    begin with 'AUTODOC' are assumed to be supporting templates that will be
    included by top-level templates.

    It is important to note that templates beginning with the two characters
    '#!' are treated differently than other templates. A normal template
    will be processed by Template directly into the appropriate output file.
    If the template begins with '#!' however, it will be processed into a
    script file, and then run. The script is expected to produce the
    appropriate output. See the AUTODOC-graph.png and
    AUTODOC-inheritance.png templates for examples of this.

  INCLUDED TEMPLATES
    Top-level templates included with the distribution are listed below.
    Examples of the output of the included templates can be found in the
    distribution's examples directory.

   AUTODOC-dump.txt
    This is a very simple template that just gets the generated data
    structure dumped using Data::Dump. The output is useful if you are
    creating your own templates, as you can use it to see what data has been
    collected from your schema, but if you are not creating templates then
    it isn't all that valuable. Note that there is not an example of this
    output in the distributions example directory, as it contains
    environmental information which may be sensitive.

   AUTODOC-graph.dot, AUTODOC-graph.html, AUTODOC-graph.png
    These templates are used to produce a GraphViz graph showing the
    relationships between the classes. The AUTODOC-graph.dot file produces a
    GraphViz .dot file that can be used by command-line utilities such as
    'dot' or 'fdp' to produce various types of output. The AUTODOC-graph.png
    template runs fdp to produce a .png output file. The AUTODOC-graph.html
    template produces an HTML output file which includes a client-side image
    map, linking various parts of the diagram to the main html
    documentation.

   AUTODOC-inheritance.dot, AUTODOC-inheritance.html, AUTODOC-inheritance.png
    Similar to the AUTODOC-graph.* templates, these are used to generate
    GraphViz documentation of the inheritance heirarchy of the classes,
    rather than the relationships of the data.

   AUTODOC.html
    This is the main documentation template, that generates an html page
    which documents each classes source name, table name, column
    information, keys, unique constraints and relationships.

KNOWN BUGS / LIMITATIONS
    These are the known bugs and/or limitations in the current version of
    this package.

  Not Windows compatible?
    There are probably some windows-incompatibilities in the code, I've
    tried to keep everything portable, but I'd be surprised if it works on
    Windows on the first try. Patches welcome.

  Having problems with GraphViz and fonts?
    If you get an error from fdp that says something like:

      Error: Could not find/open font : Times-Roman

    Then you probably need to do the following:

    Locate a truetype font on your system to use (or download one)
          [jason@critter ~ 0]$ locate .ttf
          ...
          /Library/Fonts/Arial.ttf
          ...

    Add a -Gfontpath option with the directory to the font
          fdp -Gfontpath="/Library/Fonts" (other options from above)

    Add fontname options for the Graph as well as for Nodes and Edges
          -Gfontname=Arial -Nfontname=Arial -Efontname=Arial

    So your final command line looks something like this:
          fdp -Gfontpath=/Library/Fonts -Gfontname=Arial \
            -Nfontname=Arial -Efontname=Arial

        Then use this value as the c<--graphviz-command> option to
        dbicx-autodoc, or as the "graphviz_command" option to
        DBICx::AutoDoc.

          % dbicx-autodoc --schema=MyApp::DB --graphviz-command='fdp \
            -Gfontpath=/Library/Fonts -Gfontname=Arial -Nfontname=Arial \
            -Efontname=Arial' --output=./docs
