0.8 2004/10/25

 - Marko Haim <Haim.Marko at comverse.com> reported that access lists
   were being reordered.  Very tricky bug, but fixed now.

0.7 2003/12/02

 - Charles Arsenault <charlesa at teleglobe.net> requested more flexibility
   in banner statements and also support for RANCID's <removed> lines.
   He sent a patch.

 - "Fix" bug https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=2749 reported
