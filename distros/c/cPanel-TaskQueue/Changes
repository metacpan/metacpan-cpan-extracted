Revision history for cPanel-TaskQueue

0.902
     - Revert: Use atomic filesystem operations for cPanel::StateFile.
       "we have code that fails when the file is changed out from under it"

     - Reduce reconstitute overhead by 40%
     - Try non-blocking flock before expensive alarm setup
     - Auto generate META.json as suggested by CPANTS.
0.901
     - Don't confuse callers by returning a failure if plugin already included
     - Travis testing
     - Track Makefile.PL for Travis
     - Adjust tests to pass as a result of 3d8ad9b6de

0.606     2014-02-20 12:56:10 America/Chicago
       Only update state file if not already up to date.
0.605     2013-04-12 11:09:30 America/Chicago
       Remove concurrency problem that could result in lost tasks. Weaken
       reference to data object that causes a memory leak.
0.604     2012-11-29 12:41:58 America/Chicago
       Correct scheduler code to use the new reconstitute method to restore
       task objects loaded from disk.
0.603     2012-11-26 10:47:36 America/Chicago
       Add flag to prevent YAML::Syck from reblessing objects from disk. This
       turns out to be a security problem. Add c::TQ::Task::reconstitute class
       method to recreate Task objects that have been serialized.
0.602     2012-10-26 16:06:06 America/Chicago
       Correct importing of cPanel::TaskQueue::Scheduler in the module
       cPanel::TaskQueue::ChildProcessor. Failed if configuration had been set
       to non-defaults elsewhere in the code.
0.601     2011-09-15 16:19:13 America/Chicago
       Better handling of conversion of state files in taskqueuectrl.
       Add 'info' command that displays serialization information.
       Corrected error is pause/resume handling.

0.600     2011-09-14 12:40:57 America/Chicago
       Add support for serializing the queue and scheduler data in Storable
       format as well as YAML.
       Default the queue and scheduler to Storable for serialization.
       Provide command in taskqueuectl to convert from one serialization format
       to another.
       Improve test coverage.
0.504     2011-07-28 12:14:24 America/Chicago

       One more attempt to kill the race condition reported by CPANTESTERS.
0.503_03  2011-07-11 11:15:02 America/Chicago
       Many CPANTESTERS machines apparently do not allow writing to /tmp, but
       still have File::Spec->tmpdir() returning that directory. Modified temp
       directory handlign in tests.
       Modify test to reduce failure due to race condition.
0.503_02  2011-01-25 12:12:37 America/Chicago

       Fix a Fork/exception interaction in cPanel::TaskQueue::ChildProcessor
       that results in multiple server processes running.
0.502     2010-11-22 12:13:24 America/Chicago
       Pass the logger object from the CacheFile to the process_task routine
       on the processor. This way the processor can log properly.
       Make certain that a task with no processor is removed from the queue.
       Add checked_system utility method in Processor object.
