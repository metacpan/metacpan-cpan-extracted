CGI::Builder::TT2
-----------------

DESCRIPTION
    This module transparently integrates "CGI::Builder" and "Template" in a
    very handy, powerful and flexible framework that can save you a lot of
    coding, time and resources.

    With this module, you don't need to produce the "page_content" within
    your page handlers anymore (unless you want to); you don't even need to
    manage a template system yourself (unless you want to).

    If you use a template system on your own (i.e. not integrated in a CBF
    extension), you will have to write all this code explicitly:

    *   create a page handler for each page as usual

    *   create a new template object and assign a new template file

    *   find the runtime values and assign them to the template object

    *   run the template process and set the "page_content" to the produced
        output

    You can save all that by just including this module in your build,
    because it implements an internal transparent and automatic template
    system that even without your explicit intervention is capable of
    finding the correct template and the correct runtime values to fill it,
    and generates the page_content auto-magically. With this module you can
    even eliminate the page handlers that are just setting the page_content,
    because the page is automatically sent by the template system.
