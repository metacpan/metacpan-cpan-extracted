Dist::Zilla::App::Command::regenerate

"Dist::Zilla::App::Command::regenerate" provides a "regenerate" command
to "Dist::Zilla" that allows some simple tooling to update your source
tree when you choose to.

This works by producing a new synthetic target like the "release"
target, which happens after the "build" stage, but does not produce a
release.

In conjunction with appropriate "plugins" performing "-Regenerator",
This means that:

*   You won't be frustrated with "dzil build" constantly tweaking your
    source tree

*   You won't be forced to ship a release just to update the state of
    some files that are generated by plugins

*   You won't even have to update your source tree ever if you don't
    want to.

When calling "dzil regenerate", a full copy of the distribution is built
in a temporary directory like it does when you call "dzil test".

Then after "dzil regenerate" has written your built distribution out to
the temporary directory, any "plugin"'s that perform the "-Regenerator"
role are called and told where your source tree is, and where the build
tree is, and they are expected to do the required work.

In effect, "dzil regenerate" is a lot like:

  dzil build --not && \
    DO_STUFF_WITH .build/latest/  && \
    MAYBECOPY .build/latest/stuff ./stuff

Where those last 2 lines are done with "plugins".
