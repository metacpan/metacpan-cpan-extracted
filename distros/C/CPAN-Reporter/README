NAME
    CPAN::Reporter - Adds CPAN Testers reporting to CPAN.pm

VERSION
    version 1.2018

SYNOPSIS
    From the CPAN shell:

      cpan> install Task::CPAN::Reporter
      cpan> reload cpan
      cpan> o conf init test_report

    Installing Task::CPAN::Reporter will pull in additional dependencies
    that new CPAN Testers will need.

    Advanced CPAN Testers with custom Test::Reporter::Transport setups may
    wish to install only CPAN::Reporter, which has fewer dependencies.

DESCRIPTION
    The CPAN Testers project captures and analyzes detailed results from
    building and testing CPAN distributions on multiple operating systems
    and multiple versions of Perl. This provides valuable feedback to module
    authors and potential users to identify bugs or platform compatibility
    issues and improves the overall quality and value of CPAN.

    One way individuals can contribute is to send a report for each module
    that they test or install. CPAN::Reporter is an add-on for the CPAN.pm
    module to send the results of building and testing modules to the CPAN
    Testers project. Full support for CPAN::Reporter is available in CPAN.pm
    as of version 1.92.

GETTING STARTED
  Installation
    The first step in using CPAN::Reporter is to install it using whatever
    version of CPAN.pm is already installed. CPAN.pm will be upgraded as a
    dependency if necessary.

      cpan> install CPAN::Reporter

    If CPAN.pm was upgraded, it needs to be reloaded.

      cpan> reload cpan

  Configuration
    If upgrading from a very old version of CPAN.pm, users may be prompted
    to renew their configuration settings, including the 'test_report'
    option to enable CPAN::Reporter.

    If not prompted automatically, users should manually initialize
    CPAN::Reporter support. After enabling CPAN::Reporter, CPAN.pm will
    automatically continue with interactive configuration of CPAN::Reporter
    options.

      cpan> o conf init test_report

    Users will need to enter an email address in one of the following
    formats:

      johndoe@example.com
      John Doe <johndoe@example.com>
      "John Q. Public" <johnqpublic@example.com>

    Users that are new to CPAN::Reporter should accept the recommended
    values for other configuration options.

    Users will be prompted to create a *Metabase profile* file that uniquely
    identifies their test reports. See "The Metabase" below for details.

    After completing interactive configuration, be sure to commit (save) the
    CPAN configuration changes.

      cpan> o conf commit

    See CPAN::Reporter::Config for advanced configuration settings.

   The Metabase
    CPAN::Reporter sends test reports to a server known as the Metabase.
    This requires an active Internet connection and a profile file. To
    create the profile, users will need to run "metabase-profile" from a
    terminal window and fill the information at the prompts. This will
    create a file called "metabase_id.json" in the current directory. That
    file should be moved to the ".cpanreporter" directory inside the user's
    home directory.

    Users with an existing metabase profile file (e.g. from another
    machine), should copy it into the ".cpanreporter" directory instead of
    creating a new one. Profile files may be located outside the
    ".cpanreporter" directory by following instructions in
    CPAN::Reporter::Config.

   Default Test Comments
    This module puts default text into the "TESTER COMMENTS" section,
    typically, "none provided" if doing interactive testing, or, if doing
    smoke testing that sets C<$ENV{AUTOMATED_TESTING}> to a true value,
    "this report is from an automated smoke testing program and was not
    reviewed by a human for accuracy." If C<CPAN::Reporter> is configured to
    allow editing of the report, this can be edited during submission.

    If you wish to override the default comment, you can create a file named
    C<comment.txt> in the configuration directory (typically ".cpanreporter"
    under the user's home directory), with the default comment you would
    like to appear.

    Note that if your test is an automated smoke test
    (C<$ENV{AUTOMATED_TESTING}> is set to a true value), the smoke test
    notice ("this report is from an automated smoke testing program and was
    not reviewed by a human for accuracy") is included along with a blank
    line before your C<comment.txt>, so that it is always possible to
    distinguish automated tests from non-automated tests that use this
    module.

  Using CPAN::Reporter
    Once CPAN::Reporter is enabled and configured, test or install modules
    with CPAN.pm as usual.

    For example, to test the File::Marker module:

      cpan> test File::Marker

    If a distribution's tests fail, users will be prompted to edit the
    report to add additional information that might help the author
    understand the failure.

UNDERSTANDING TEST GRADES
    CPAN::Reporter will assign one of the following grades to the report:

    *   "pass" -- distribution built and tested correctly

    *   "fail" -- distribution failed to test correctly

    *   "unknown" -- distribution failed to build, had no test suite or
        outcome was inconclusive

    *   "na" --- distribution is not applicable to this platform and/or
        version of Perl

    In returning results of the test suite to CPAN.pm, "pass" and "unknown"
    are considered successful attempts to "make test" or "Build test" and
    will not prevent installation. "fail" and "na" are considered to be
    failures and CPAN.pm will not install unless forced.

    An error from Makefile.PL/Build.PL or make/Build will also be graded as
    "unknown" and a failure will be signaled to CPAN.pm.

    If prerequisites specified in "Makefile.PL" or "Build.PL" are not
    available, no report will be generated and a failure will be signaled to
    CPAN.pm.

PRIVACY WARNING
    CPAN::Reporter includes information in the test report about environment
    variables and special Perl variables that could be affecting test
    results in order to help module authors interpret the results of the
    tests. This includes information about paths, terminal, locale,
    user/group ID, installed toolchain modules (e.g. ExtUtils::MakeMaker)
    and so on.

    These have been intentionally limited to items that should not cause
    harmful personal information to be revealed -- it does *not* include
    your entire environment. Nevertheless, please do not use CPAN::Reporter
    if you are concerned about the disclosure of this information as part of
    your test report.

    Users wishing to review this information may choose to edit the report
    prior to sending it.

BUGS
    Using command_timeout on Linux may cause problems. See
