Device-Inverter-KOSTAL-PIKO

The modules and scripts of this distribution are designed to
gather and process log data of KOSTAL PIKO inverters
(http://www.kostal-solar-electric.com/content/en/?am=58&as=66&ass=72&al=en&mp=72&kat=6),
that is, devices which are typically needed as part of a solar
power plant.

I wrote this to collect the log data from my PIKO 8.3.  Since I
had no other devices to test at hand, it might well be that the
code will currently not work for other devices, especially ones
with different language settings.  (Mine delivers its log data
with German headlines.)

If you own a similar device and are interested in using this
distribution, please let me know!
