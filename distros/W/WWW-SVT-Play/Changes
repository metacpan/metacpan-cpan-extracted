WWW::SVT::Play 0.1, 2013-02-10

 * Initial release

This module supports extraction of meta data from the URLs
on SVT Play (<http://svtplay.se>). It is meant to ease the
use of SVT Play from the command line, e.g. viewing videos
with mplayer instead of the flash player. But it could also
be used just to get information about title, duration and
other stuff.

A simple script is included, useful for getting the stream
URLs for a given video.
