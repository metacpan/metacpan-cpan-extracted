NAME

    multidimensional - disables multidimensional array emulation

VERSION

    version 0.013

SYNOPSIS

        no multidimensional;
    
        $hash{1, 2};                # dies
        $hash{join($;, 1, 2)};      # doesn't die

DESCRIPTION

    Perl's multidimensional array emulation stems from the days before the
    language had references, but these days it mostly serves to bite you
    when you typo a hash slice by using the $ sigil instead of @.

    This module lexically makes using multidimensional array emulation a
    fatal error at compile time.

METHODS

 unimport

    Disables multidimensional array emulation for the remainder of the
    scope being compiled.

 import

    Enables multidimensional array emulation for the remainder of the scope
    being compiled;

SEE ALSO
