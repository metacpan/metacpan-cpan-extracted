=> NAME

ePod - Handles easy-POD: write easy and simple, convert to POD, and from there you know the way.

=> DESCRIPTION

This module is used to conver easy-POD files to POD.

easy-POD is a simpler version of POD, and is made to write POD files without worry about:

*> Lines and spaces between commands.
*> The use of =over and =back for itens.
*> Case sensitive of X<> formatters.

/*>

Soo, easy-POD let you make some mistakes when writing POD, than it will fixe them for you when converting to POD.

Actually ePod was created to enable non-programmer persons to writed well formated, structured and indexed documentation, and was inspirated in POD.

I<** See .epod files in the "B<./test>" directory of the distribution.>

=> USAGE

  use ePod ;

  my $epod = new ePod( over_size => 10 ) ;

  my $pod = $epod->epod2pod( "Foo.epod" ) ;

  print $pod ;

=> METHODS

==> new ( %OPTIONS )

Create a new I<ePod> object.

B<OPTIONS:>

*> over_size ( N )

Set the size/level of I<"=over N">, where I<N> is a number.

==> epod2pod ( FILE|DATA|FILEHANDLE )

Convert the given ePod FILE|DATA|GLOB to POD.

*> FILE|DATA|FILEHANDLE

Can be a FILE path, DATA (SCALAR) or FILEHANDLE (GLOB)

==> to_pod ( FILE|DATA|FILEHANDLE , NEW_POD_FILE , REPLACE )

Convert the given ePod FILE|DATA|GLOB to a POD file.

*> FILE|DATA|FILEHANDLE

Can be a FILE path, DATA (SCALAR) or FILEHANDLE (GLOB)

*> NEW_POD_FILE

The file path to the new pod file. If not defined will use the same path and name from the ePod file, or I<"unamed.pod">.

*> REPLACE

If I<TRUE> tells to that the file (I<NEW_POD_FILE>) can be replaced.

If I<FALSE|undef> and the file already exists this format will be used: "%name-%x.pod", where I<%name> is the file name and I<%x> is a number free.

==> is_epod (DATA)

Check if a given DATA has ePod syntax.

=> easy-POD Syntax

*> =headx

Use => for the I<head> command, and the level is set with I<"=">.

  =>   same as =head1
  ==>  same as =head2
  ===> same as =head3

*> =item

Use *> for the =item command, and the level is set with I<"*">.

Note that you don't need to declare =over and =back to use *>.

Example:

  *> item1
  item2 text
  **> item1.1

  *> item2
  item2 text
  
  **> item2.1
  ***> item2.1.1
  *> item3

Equivalent POD:

  =over 10
  
  =item item1
  
  item2 text
  
  =over 10
  
  =item item1.1
  
  =back
  
  =item item2
  
  item2 text
  
  =over 10
  
  =item item2.1
  
  =over 10
  
  =item item2.1.1
  
  =back
  
  =back
  
  =item item3
  
  =back


*> Explicity end of a item:

To explicity end a item, use I<"/"> before the item level. Soo to end *> will be /*>, and for **> is /**>

You need to explocity end a item only when you want a text after an item outside of it. Example:

  *> item1
  the item text.
  *> item2
  the item text again.
  
  and more item text.
  /*>
  
  Text outside of itens.

Equivalent POD:

  =over 10
  
  =item item1
  
  the item text.
  
  =item item2
  
  the item text again.
  
  and more item text.
  
  =back
  
  Text outside of itens.

/*>

B<Note that if you want to use POD syntax with easy-POD you won't be able to use =head and =item commands.>

B<All the other POD syntax can be used with easy-POD syntax.>
