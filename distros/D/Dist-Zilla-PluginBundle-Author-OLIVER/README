NAME
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::OLIVER - Dists like OLIVER's

VERSION
    version 1.122720

DESCRIPTION
    This is the plugin bundle that OLIVER uses. It is equivalent to:

     [MetaResourcesFromGit]
  
     [ReadmeFromPod]
     [@Filter]
     -bundle = @Basic
     -remove = Readme
  
     [AutoVersion]
     [NextRelease]
     [PkgVersion]
     [PickyPodWeaver]
     [AutoPrereqs]
     [MetaJSON]

     [PruneFiles]
     filenames = dist.ini
  
     [Git::CommitBuild]
     branch =
     release_branch = master
     message = <changelog section content>
  
     [@Git]
     commit_msg = Bumped changelog following rel. v%v

RATIONALE
    The intention is to have a sane <http://github.com> layout and at the
    same time supporting CPAN upload.

    Development take place on a "devel" branch at GitHub and then releases
    are committed to the "master" branch which is the default for user
    access. Commit messages to the "master" are the content of the latest
    section in the "Changes" file.

    Use of the Dist::Zilla::Plugin::MetaResourcesFromGit plugin creates
    links at CPAN which point to the GitHub pages (the wiki page is used as
    the default Homepage).

    A minor customization to the Pod::Weaver plugin restricts POD munging
    only to those files containing an "ABSTRACT" statement.

CONFIGURATION
    If you provide the "no_cpan" option with a true value to the bundle, or
    set the environment variable "NO_CPAN" to a true value, then the upload
    to CPAN will be suppressed.

    If you provide a value to the "major_version" option then it will be
    passed to the "AutoVersion" Plugin as the "major" attribute.

    If you provide a value to the "skip_deps" option then it will be passed
    to the "AutoPrereqs" Plugin as the "skip" attribute.

    If you provide a value to the "skip_files" option then it will be passed
    to the "PruneFiles" Plugin as the "match" attribute.

    If you provide one or more instaces of the "skip_plugin" option, then
    the values will be removed from the list of plugins imported from the
    @Basic Plugin Bundle.

TIPS
    Do not include a "NAME", "VERSION", "AUTHOR" or "LICENSE" POD section in
    your code, they will be provided automatically. However please do
    include an abstract for documented libraries via a comment like so:

     # ABSTRACT: here is my abstract statement

    The bundle is desgined for projects which are hosted on "github". More
    so, the project should have a "master" branch which is where the *built*
    code is committed, and a *separate* branch where you do code
    development. The module author uses a "devel" branch for this purpose.
    On "github" you can then leave the "master" branch as the default branch
    for web browsing.
