ShiftJIS::String: version 1.11
==============

NAME

ShiftJIS::String - functions to manipulate Shift-JIS strings

SYNOPSIS

  use ShiftJIS::String qw(length substr index rindex);

  $str = 'プログラミング-Perl';
  $sub = substr($str, index($str, 'ラミ') + length('ラミ'));

   # $sub eq 'ング-Perl'.
   # If you want to use core functions after importing,
   # prefix the core function name with 'CORE::', like CORE::length.

DESCRIPTION

This module provides some functions which emulate
the corresponding CORE functions and will help someone
to manipulate Shift-JIS string.

* Functions other than length(), substr(), index(), and rindex()
will have different names from those of the corresponding CORE:: functions.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

If you have a C compiler and want to use XSUB edition,
type the following (!! "enableXS" must run before "Makefile.PL" !!):

   perl enableXS
   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

If you decide to install pure Perl (i.e. non-XS) edition after trying
to build XSUB, type the following:

   make clean
   perl disableXS
   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install
