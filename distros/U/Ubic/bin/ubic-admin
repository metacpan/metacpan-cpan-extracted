=head1 NAME

ubic_admin - ubic administration script

=head1 VERSION

version 1.60

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    ubic-admin setup [--batch-mode] [--quiet] [other options]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This script can be used to perform ubic administration operations.

There is only one command supported by now, I<setup>.

The logic behind the separation of setup process to this script instead of
implementing it as C<ubic setup> command is following: C<ubic> script always
operates on services, each of its commands (C<ubic status>, C<ubic start>, etc.)
can accept service names. C<ubic-admin>, on the other hand, performs installation-wide tasks.
