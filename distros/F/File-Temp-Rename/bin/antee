=head1 NAME

antee - read input from STDIN, write to a temporary staging file, and rename it to FILENAME when there is nothing left to read.  

=head1 VERSION

version 0.02

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 antee [-t|--stdout] [-T|--stderr] [-n|--no-clobber] FILENAME

=head1 DESCRIPTION

antee is like tee(1) in that it reads input from STDIN and writes it to a file,
but all output is staged to the temporary file first, which is renamed to the
final filename only when there is nothing left to read.  It is useful for
staging the output of long running processes with lots of output, to avoid
partially written files in the case of error.  

 -t write all input to stdout
 -T write all input to stderr
 -n do not clobber if FILENAME already exists

The name 'antee' was chosen b/c 'antechamber' means waiting room, so it's
tee(1) with a waiting room...

=head1 EXAMPLES

Write all the output of long_running_process to output-file.tmpXXXXX, where
XXXXX are random characters, and rename output-file.tmpXXXXX to output-file
only when long_running_process is finished:

 long_running_process | antee output-file

You don't have to check the output-file to see if it completed or not, since
it'll never be created if it didn't.  In case of error, just remove the tmp
files with the command below and start over:

 rm output-file.tmp*

Write all output of long_running_process to output-file via a temporary file
like above, but pipe all output to some_other_program as well.

 long_running_process | antee -t output-file | some_other_program

Same as above, but without the benefit of a temporary file by using the tee
command instead of antee.

 long_running_process | tee output-file | some_other_program
