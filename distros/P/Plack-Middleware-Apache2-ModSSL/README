NAME
    Plack::Middleware::Apache2::ModSSL - pull in $env data from mod_ssl API

SYNOPSIS
     builder
     {
       enable "Apache2::ModSSL",
              vars => [qw(SSL_CLIENT_CERT)];
       $app;
     };

DESCRIPTION
    Apache mod_ssl provides a bunch of data about the SSL connection. While
    much of this is often exposed in environment variables, sometimes server
    configuration (especially the *SSLOptions* configuration directive) will
    result in some of the data not being available to your application. This
    module pokes into the mod_ssl API to retrieve the data you need and stash
    it away in Plack's $env.

    You may be able to tweak your Apache configuration and persuade it to give
    you the data you want via environment variables, in which case Plack's
    Apache2 handler will automatically copy them into $env and you don't need
    this module.

  `vars`
    Specifies an arrayref listing SSL-related variables to add to $env.

  `server_exts`
    An arrayref of OIDs which will be exported from the server's certificate.
    It's incredibly unlikely you need this.

  `client_exts`
    An arrayref of OIDs which will be exported from the client's certificate.
    It's pretty unlikely you need this.

BUGS
    Plack::Middleware::Apache2::ModSSL uses Apache2::ModSSL which is an XS
    module (and a bit of a pain to build at that). The latter has an oddity in
    how it loads up the XS part of the module. To counteract the oddity, I've
    found it necessary to add this to my PSGI, near the top:

     BEGIN { $ENV{MOD_PERL} ||= 'mod_perl' };

    If you get error messages about the `ssl_var_lookup` method not being
    defined in package Apache2::Connection, then try the above.
