0.32 Thu Jul 29 20:21:56 JST 2010

  * added workaround for $@ issue in Data::Util.

0.31 Mon Jul 26 20:52:38 2010
  * Just copied from MooseX-Getopt 0.31. See MouseX-Getopt.diff for details.

NOTE: This distribution is a copy of MooseX-Getopt, so the following history
      is that of MooseX-Getopt's, not MouseX-Geopt's.

0.31 Wed 7 Jul 2010
  * Fix issue causing tests to fail if MooseX::SimpleConfig isn't installed.

0.30 Tue 6 Jul 2010
  * MooseX::Getopt::Basic
    - uses attribute insertion order when determining the order in which
      options are documented in the usage (e.g. in $obj->usage->text). (Karen
      Etheridge)

  * MooseX::Getopt::Basic
    - store the usage object to the usage attr (RT#58715)
    - properly checks whether the *option* --help, --usage, or --? were used,
      rather than the attribute 'help', 'usage' or '?' were set
  * MooseX::Getopt::GLD
    - add the usage attribute for storing the Getopt::Long::Descriptive::Usage
      object, and the help attribute for storing --help, --usage and --? state
  (RT#47865, RT#56783, RT#52474).  (Karen Etheridge)

  * MooseX::Getopt::Basic
    - Disable auto_help config in Getopt::Long, to avoid calling into
    pod2usage when the --help option is used while MooseX::ConfigFromFile
    is in use (the intent is just to fetch the value of the configfile
    option) (RT#57683). (Karen Etheridge)

      override the tr/_/-/ replacement ::Dashes does on attribute names

     it can be overridden.

    * MooseX::Getopt
      - removed the default handling with Getopt::Long::Descriptive
        as it would override constructor parameters and that was
        bad. Besides, Moose will just DWIM on this anyway. (stevan)
        - added test for it (stevan)

    * t/
      - fixed Getopt::Long::Descriptive specific tests to only run
        if Getopt::Long::Descriptive is there (stevan)
