This is the Custom directory for FullAuto. FullAuto looks in this directory
for all configuration and user customized code. The Distro directory contains
copies of the distribution version of these files. The same distrobution copies
appear in this Custom directory when FullAuto is first installed. However,
during future CPAN updates/upgrades of a pre-existing FullAuto installation,
only the Distro directories will receive new files. Customized files in this
directory will not be overwritten, and it is left to the user/FullAuto admin
to migrate custom code to the new distro copies manually - should such migration
be desired and/or necessary. If necessary, an individual performing an update/
upgrade will be informed of this at the time the FullAuto installer (via CPAN
or manually using Build.PL or Makefile.PL) is being run.
