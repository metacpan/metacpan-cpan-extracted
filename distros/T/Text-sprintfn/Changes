          Works, Downsides, Todos.


0.05    2012-10-03 (SHARYANTO)

        - No functional changes. Faster performance by avoiding using named
          capture in regex. Benchmark on a simple format: sprintfn("%(a)s%s%s",
          {a=>1, b=>9}, 2, 3), shows increase from around 19k/s to 49k/sec
          (150%).


0.04    2011-11-01 (SHARYANTO)

        - No functional changes. Add missing $VERSION.


0.03    2011-10-23 (SHARYANTO)

        - Rewrite implementation (third time's the charm), now everything works
          and only calls sprintf() once.


0.02    2011-10-23 (SHARYANTO)

        - Rewrite implementation, now works with * and \d+$, but still has
          trouble with vector flag combination.


0.01    2011-10-22 (SHARYANTO)

        - First release, still has problems with '*' in formats.
