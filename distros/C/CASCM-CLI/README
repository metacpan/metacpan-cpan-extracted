NAME


CASCM::CLI - A unified CLI for CA Harvest SCM



USAGE


    hv [options] subcommand [options] [arguments]



DESCRIPTION


hv provides a unified, context aware CLI for CA Harvest SCM.



CONTEXT


hv looks for, collects, merges and passes on context and options to
underlying Harvest commands. This allows context to be configured in
various locations.

Context files are .ini files. Please see the documentation in
CASCM::Wrapper for the format and examples of context files.

The following precedence is used when merging context from various
sources.

-   command-line

        hv hci -st Developement

    Harvest CLI options can be provided directly on the command line,
    just like you would when running harvest commands directly

-   Project-specific Context

    The project context is a context file .hvcontext in the current
    directory

-   User-specific Context

    The user's context file defaults to .hvcontext in the user's home
    directory. This can also be specified using the HVCONTEXT
    environment variable.

-   System-wide Context

    The system wide context file defaults to $CA_SCM_HOME/hvcontext or
    $HARVEST_HOME/hvcontext



LOGGING


Unlike harvest commands, hv will, by default, log to STDOUT(or STDERR).
Harvest specific log files are not created.



SUBCOMMANDS


Almost all harvest commands are supported as subcommands. Please see
CASCM::Wrapper for a full list of supported commands.
