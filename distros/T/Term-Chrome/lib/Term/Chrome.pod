=head1 NAME

Term::Chrome - DSL for colors and other terminal chrome

=head1 SYNOPSIS

=for test_synopsis
  use feature qw<say>;


    use Term::Chrome qw<Red Blue Bold Reset Underline Green color>;

    # Base color constant and attribute
    say Red, 'red text', Reset;

    # Composition, using operator overloading
    say Red/Blue+Bold, 'red on blue', Reset;

    # Undo
    say Bold, 'bold', !Bold, 'not bold';

    # Extended xterm-256 colors
    say color(125) + Underline, 'Purple', Reset;

    # Define your own constants
    use constant Pink => color 213;

    # Use ${} around Chrome expression inside strings
    say "normal ${ Red+Bold } RED ${ +Reset } normal";

    # Extract components
    say( (Red/Blue)->bg, "blue text", (Green+Reset)->flags );

Chromizer: get a closure that applies given chrome before, and undo after
the argument.

=for test_synopsis
  use Term::Chrome qw<Red Blue Bold Reset Underline Green color>;
  use feature qw<say>;


    # Get an efficient chromizer
    my $boldifier = \&{ +Bold };
    # Use the chromizer
    say $boldifier->("bold text");
    # Same as:
    say Bold, "bold text", !Bold;

    # Short lived chromizers using color literals:
    say(&{+Red}('red'));
    say(&{ Red/Blue + Bold }('red on blue'));
    # Same, but requires perl 5.21.4+
    #say(( Red/Blue + Bold )->('red on blue'));

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<Term::Chrome> is a domain-specific language (DSL) for terminal decoration
(colors and other attributes).

In the current implementation stringification to ANSI sequences for C<xterm>
and C<xterm-256> is hard-coded (which means it doesn't use the L<terminfo(5)>
database), but this gives optimized (short) strings.

Colors and attributes are exposed as objects that have overloading for
arithmetic operators.

=head1 EXPORTS

=head2 Functions

C<color(I<0-255>)>

Build a L<Term::Chrome> object with the given color number. You can use this
constructor to create your own set of color constants.

For example, C<color(0)> gives the same result as C<Black> (but not the same
object).

=head2 Colors

Each of these function return a Chrome object.

=head2 Decoration flags

The exact rendering of each flag is dependent on how the terminal implements
them. For example C<Underline> and C<Blink> may do nothing.

C<Underline>

=head1 METHODS

Here are the methods on C<Term::Chrome> objects:

=over 4

=item C<fg>

Extract the Chrome object of just the foreground color. Maybe C<undef>.

=item C<bg>

Extract the Chrome object of the just background color. Maybe C<undef>.

=item C<flags>

Extract a Chrome object of just the decoration flags. Maybe C<undef>.

=back

=head1 OVERLOADED OPERATORS

=over 4

=item C</> (mnemonic: "over")

Conmbine a foreground color (on the left) with a background color.

=item C<+>

Add decoration flags (on the right) to colors (on the left).

=item C<""> (stringification)

Transform the object into a sting of ANSI sequences. This is
particularly useful to directly use a Chrome object in a double quoted string.

=item C<${}> (scalar dereference)

Same result as C<""> (stringification). This operator is overloaded because
it is convenient to interpolate Chrome expressions in double-quoted strings.

Examples:

    say "normal ${ +Red } red ${ +Reset }";
    say "normal ${ Red + Bold } red ${ +Reset }";

Note that you must force expression parsing context when a Chrome constant is
used alone inside C<${ }>: C<${ +Red }> or C<${ (Red) }> or C<${ Red() }>.
C<use strict 'vars';> will detect those cases, but you may miss them in
one-liners.

=item C<&{}> (code dereference, or I<codulation>)

Wrap some text with the given chrome and C<Reset>.

Example:

    say Red->("red text");
    # Same result as:
    say Red, "red text", Reset;

Unfortunately perl had a bug
(L<perl RT#122607|https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=122607>) that makes this feature not much usable in practice when applied to constants. That bug
is fixed in perl 5.21.4+.
On perl < 5.21.4 you have to wrap the chrome constant in a C<do {}> or use C<&{}()>:

    say do{ Red }->("red text");
    say &{ +Red }("red text");


Codulation can also be used to extract a colorizer sub that will be more
efficient if you use it multiple times:

    my $redifier = \&{ Red };
    say $redifier->("red text");
