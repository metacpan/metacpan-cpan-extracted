how to write location modules
--

There are two types, we'll call them _files and _dirs, by analogy to
file and directory parts of a path. (The calls from Store should be
abstracted enough that we can craft _file and _dir components that
don't actually have anything to do with the filesystem, but the ones
we're using now actually all do.)

----

_file modules must implement the following methods:

MAJOR_NUMBER()
 should return '1'; each _file has a major number of 1, that's what
identifies it unambiguously as a _file module (as opposed to a _dir)
to the Store setup code.

decl_pos()
 return undef, or whatever. only needed out of parallelism with _dir
sections. (without this, there would be an unintuitive, rather than
intuitive, error if two _file sections are specified)

new ( $class, $store, $decl_pos, parsed %args )
 three responsibilities: 1) create a blessed object, 2) setup whatever
fields are needed to keep track of this particular configuration --
presumably using parsed args from def section, and 3) return a list of
the form ($self, 'string name of exported special method'...).

make_id ( $self, $struct )
 this is called to create a new id (presumably as part of an initial
store or a copy). make_id routines are called in "left to right"
order, so this is called last after all of the _dir make_id's are
called. the $struct argument has the following fields:

store - the Store object that is doing the calling.
doc - the Doc that the id is being made on behalf of
locs - a reference to a list of "pieces" of the being-constructed location
ids - a reference to a list of "pieces" of the being-constructed id
overflow - a flag indicating whether we are being called in the context of an 
           "overflow" from a further-right compatriot (this will never
           be true for _file sections)

 the job of this method is to put the pieces of the location and id
together in a appropriate ways, adding to them to create new
(presumably unique) location and id strings, and to return those
complete strings.

 make_id may return a special value -- the string
'COMMA_DB_SEQUENCE_SET' -- if this location module is actually going
to depend on the database/indexing code to generate a unique
doc_id. ugly hacks in the SQL layers handle id generation, in this
case. and the write() method is responsibly for doing some cleanup and
setting the doc's storage_info fields. see the source of the
Index_Only module.

write ( $self, $store, $location, $id, $output_text_block, $doc )
 write out to permanent store - given both location and id for
 convenience, also given a reference to the doc object itself, for
 unusual cases. normally a locattion module woul just write out the
 text block that has been produced by the filter stages.

read ( $self, $store, $location, $id )
 read from permanent store

erase ( $self, $location, $doc )
 erase from permanent store

location_from_id ( $self, $store, $id, $location )
 as with make_id, this is called at the tail end of a chain. the $id
argument should be just the final piece of the id string, the "lefter"
parts of the string having been consumed by preceding
_dir->location_from_id() calls. the $location argument should be the
location string constructed thus far. this method should turn the
piece of the id that it is given into a final location piece and
return ('', $full_location_string), or die with an error.

id_from_location ( $self, $store, $id, $location ) 
 just like location_from_id, only does the transform in the opposite
direction

next_location ( $self, $store, $location, $direction )
 called with a full location string, must return either the "next"
location of a stored Doc, or undef if there is no next Doc. the
$direction arg should be >=0 for 'up', or <=0 for 'down'.

first_location ( $self, $store )
 get the first location of a stored Doc. "first" means that
next_location() returns undef when called with this location and
a negative direction.

last_location ( $self, $store ) 
 get the last location of a stored Doc. "last" means that
next_location() returns undef when called with this location and a
positive direction.

write_blob ( $self, $store, $store_location, $store_id, $blob, 
             $content, $new_location )
 write the given blob/content in the permanent store. last argument is
a boolean: if true, create a new blob_location. if false, use the
blob's current location if possible, or create a new location if
not. return the blob_location used.

read_blob ( $self, $store, $blob )
 read and return the content from the given blob.

copy_to_blob ( $self, $store, $store_location, $store_id, $blob, 
               $from_filename, $to_location )
 almost the same as write_blob: write the content contained in the
given $filename to the permanent store. return the blob_location to
which the blob was written. the last argument is optional. if given a
to_location, this method must use that as the place to copy the blob
to, otherwise this method must make its own decision (presumably make
a new) location.

erase_blob ( $self, $store, $blob, $blob_location )
 remove the blob from the permanent store. the last argument is
optional, the routine should use $blob->get_location() if one isn't
given, and should use the passed blob_location if its available.

touch ( $self, $store, $location )
 update the mod time of the given $location. return the updated mod
time.

last_modified ( $self, $store, $location )
 return the mod time of the give $location.

----

_dir modules are considerably simpler, having only six required
methods, all of which are similar to methods described above.

MAJOR_NUMBER ()
 this is used as the primary sort criterion for ordering _dir modules
in relation to one another. (having an explicit sort order could be a
good idea for some sets of directory pairings, rather than relying on
config files to make sure that orders are compatible. However, modules
that are careful about making sure that their lengths are always
specified probably don't need to sort differently, so it's nice for
operators to be able to specify the order in which ids/locations are
structured. So the *standard* MAJOR_NUMBER is '400', by
convention. NOTE: '1' is reserved for _file modules.

decl_pos ()
 the secondary sort criterion for ordering these modules is the
declaration order. so this method should return the position of this
location field (relative to other location fields) in the storage
def. (see new(), for where to get the information used to determine
the declaration position.)

new ( $class, parsed %args )
 almost exactly like _file->new(). additionally, a 'decl_pos' arg is
passed, whihc should be squirreled away in a field so that decl_pos()
can return it, later.

make_id ( $self, $struct )
 very similar to _file->make_id(). unlike _file->make_id(), this
method only returns the new *pieces* that it creates for the id and
location strings: return ( $id_piece, $location_piece). things are
specified this way in order for the Store code that controls the
calling chain to be able to handle overflow situations as easily as
possible. which brings us to an additional responsibility that the
_dir modules have here -- to check and handle the "overflow" case as
indicated by the $struct->{overflow} flag. if this location is able to
create additional capacity in response to an overflow down the chain,
it should do so. if not, it should return undef (or die??? FIX this
note).

location_from_id ( $self, $store, $id, $location )
 handles a part of the id->location transformation. should consume the
part of the id string that it uses, returning ( $shortened_id,
$lengthened_location). this method is called in a left-to-right chain,
and should feel free to die with an error if it encounters any
mal-formedness in its piece of id. it should not check for existence
or validity beyond well-formedness -- that's not its job.

id_from_location ( $self, $store, $id, $location )
 just like location_from_id, but does the transform in the opposite
direction.

NOTE: File-based storages *really* need to include an extension, so
that it is easy to pull doc files out of directories. The suggested
default extension is '.comma'. This isn't enforced, even by the
Abstract_file template, but it's worth remembering.
