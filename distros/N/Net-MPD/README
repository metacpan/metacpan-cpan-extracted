SYNOPSIS

      use Net::MPD;
    
      my $mpd = Net::MPD->connect();
    
      $mpd->stop();
      $mpd->clear();

      }

DESCRIPTION

    Net::MPD is designed as a lightweight replacment for Audio::MPD which
    depends on Moose and is no longer maintained.

METHODS

 connect [$address]

    Connect to the MPD running at the given address. Address takes the form
    of password@host:port. Both the password and port are optional. If no
    password is given, none will be used. If no port is given, the default
    (6600) will be used. If no host is given, localhost will be used.

    Return a Net::MPD object on success and croaks on failure.

 version

    Return the API version of the connected MPD server.

 update_status

    Issue a status command to MPD and stores the results in the local
    object. The results are also returned as a hashref.

MPD ATTRIBUTES

    Most of the "status" attributes have been written as combined
    getter/setter methods. Calling the "update_status" method will update
    these values. Only the items marked with an asterisk are writable.

TODO

 Command Lists

    MPD supports sending batches of commands but that is not yet available
    with this API.

 Asynchronous IO

    Event-based handling of the idle command would make this module more
    robust.

BUGS

 Idle connections

    MPD will close the connection if left idle for too long. This module
    will reconnect if it senses that this has occurred, but the first call
    after a disconnect will fail and have to be retried. Calling the ping
    command periodically will keep the connection open if you do not have
    any real commands to issue. Calling the idle command will block until
    something interesting happens.
