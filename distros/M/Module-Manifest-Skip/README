NAME
    Module::Manifest::Skip - MANIFEST.SKIP Manangement for Modules

SYNOPSIS
    From the command line:

        > perl -MModule::Manifest::Skip=create

    From Perl:

        use Module::Manifest::Skip;
        use IO::All;

        my $mms = Module::Manifest::Skip->new;
        # optional add and removes:
        $mms->add('^foo-bar$');
        $mms->remove('^foo$');
        $mms->remove(qr/\Q\bfoo\b/);
        io('MANIFEST.SKIP')->print($mms->text);

DESCRIPTION
    NOTE: This module is mostly intended for module packaging frameworks to
    share a common, up-to-date "MANIFEST.SKIP" base. For example,
    Module::Install::ManifestSkip, uses this module to get the actual SKIP
    content. However this module may be useful for any module author.

    CPAN module authors use a "MANIFEST.SKIP" file to exclude certain well
    known files from getting put into a generated "MANIFEST" file, which
    would cause them to go into the final distribution package.

    The packaging tools try to automatically skip things for you, but if you
    add one of your own entries, you have to add all the common ones
    yourself. This module attempts to make all of this boring process as
    simple and reliable as possible.

    Module::Manifest::Skip can create or update a MANIFEST.SKIP file for
    you. You can add your own entries, and it will leave them alone. You can
    even tell it to not skip certain entries that it normally skips,
    although this is rarely needed.

USAGE
    Usually this module is called by other packaging modules. If you want
    this to be used by Module::Install, then you would put this:

        manifest_skip 'clean';

    in your "Makefile.PL", and everything would be taken care of for you.

    If you want to simply create a "MANIFEST.SKIP" file from the command
    line, this handy syntax exists:

        > perl -MModule::Manifest::Skip=create

BEHAVIOR
    This module ships with a share file called "share/MANIFEST.SKIP". This
    is the basis for all new MANIFEST.SKIP files. This module will look for
    an already existing "MANIFEST.SKIP" file and take all the text before
    the first blank line, and prepend it to the start of a new SKIP file.
    This allows you to put your own personal section at the top, that will
    not be overwritten later.

    It will then look for lines beginning with a dash followed by a space.
    Like this:

          - \bfoo\b
          - ^bar/
          - ^baz$

    It will comment out each of these lines and any other lines that match
    the text (after the '- '). This allows you to override the default
    SKIPs.
