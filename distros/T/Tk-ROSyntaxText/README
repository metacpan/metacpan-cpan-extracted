INSTALLATION

****************************************************************************
Note for testers and developers:
    If the environment variable CPAN_TEST_AUTHOR is set to a TRUE value,
    additional functionality is switched on while the regression tests are
    running:
    1. Windows that are opened as part of the tests need to be closed
       manually. This is to allow a visual check and to test window
       resizing, scrolling and so on.
       There's an 'Exit' button at the bottom of each window.
    2. The following 'quality assurance' tests are run:
       * perlcritic.t   - uses Test::Perl::Critic
       * pod.t          - uses Test::Pod
       * pod-coverage.t - uses Test::Pod::Coverage
****************************************************************************

Use any of the CPAN utilities, e.g.
    perl -MCPAN -e shell (then 'install Tk::ROSyntaxText')
    perl -MCPANPLUS -e shell (then 'i Tk::ROSyntaxText')
    cpan (then 'install Tk::ROSyntaxText')
    cpanp (then 'i Tk::ROSyntaxText')
    cpan Tk::ROSyntaxText
    cpanp i Tk::ROSyntaxText
    etc.

Or use the standard 'make' commands for a manual build:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

(you may need to substitute 'make' with a local version of this command,
e.g. 'dmake' if you're using Strawberry Perl)

Or use the Module::Build commands:

    perl Build.PL
    ./Build
    ./Build test
    ./Build install

Installation Diagnostics
------------------------

skipped: No display detected.
    Test GUIs cannot be displayed so these tests have been skipped.
    The most likely causes are X Server not running or $DISPLAY not set.
    This was introduced in version 1.001 - see the 'Changes' file for
    a fuller explanation.

skipped: Author test. To run: set $ENV{CPAN_TEST_AUTHOR} to a TRUE value.
    Should be self-explanatory.
    "Note for testers and developers" (above) has a few more details.
