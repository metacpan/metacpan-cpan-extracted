NAME
    Tie::AliasHash - Hash with aliases key (multiple keys, one value)

SYNOPSIS
      use Tie::AliasHash;

      tie %hash, 'Tie::AliasHash';
        
      $hash{ 'foo', 'bar' } = 'baz';
        
      print $hash{foo}; # prints 'baz'
      print $hash{bar}; # prints 'baz' too

      $hash{bar} = 'zab'; # $hash{foo} is changed too
      print $hash{foo}; # prints 'zab'

DESCRIPTION
    Tie::AliasHash creates hashes that can have multiple keys for a single
    value. This means that some keys are just 'aliases' for other keys.

    The example shown in the synopsys above creates a key 'foo' and an alias
    key 'bar'. The two keys share the same value, so that fetching either of
    them will always return the same value, and storing a value in one of
    them will change both.
