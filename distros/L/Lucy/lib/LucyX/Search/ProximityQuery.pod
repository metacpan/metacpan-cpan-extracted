=head1 NAME

LucyX::Search::ProximityQuery - Query matching an ordered list of terms.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $proximity_query = LucyX::Search::ProximityQuery->new( 
        field  => 'content',
        terms  => [qw( the who )],
        within => 10,    # match within 10 positions
    );
    my $hits = $searcher->hits( query => $proximity_query );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

ProximityQuery is a subclass of L<Query|Lucy::Search::Query> for matching
against an ordered sequence of terms.

=head1 CONSTRUCTORS

=head2 new

    my $proximity_query = LucyX::Search::ProximityQuery->new(
        field  => $field,   # required
        terms  => $terms,   # required
        within => $within,  # required
    );

Create a new ProximityQuery.

=over

=item *

B<field> - The field that the phrase must occur in.

=item *

B<terms> - The ordered array of terms that must match.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 get_field

    my $string = $proximity_query->get_field();

Accessor for object’s field attribute.

=head2 get_terms

    my $arrayref = $proximity_query->get_terms();

Accessor for object’s array of terms.

=head2 get_within

    my $int = $proximity_query->get_within();

Accessor for object’s within attribute.

=head2 make_compiler

    my $compiler = $proximity_query->make_compiler(
        searcher    => $searcher,     # required
        boost       => $boost,        # required
        subordinate => $subordinate,  # default: false
    );

Abstract factory method returning a Compiler derived from this Query.

=over

=item *

B<searcher> - A Searcher.

=item *

B<boost> - A scoring multiplier.

=item *

B<subordinate> - Indicates whether the Query is a subquery (as
opposed to a top-level query).  If false, the implementation must
invoke L<normalize()|Lucy::Search::Compiler/normalize> on the newly minted Compiler object before returning
it.

=back

=head1 INHERITANCE

LucyX::Search::ProximityQuery isa L<Lucy::Search::Query> isa Clownfish::Obj.
