NAME

    Test::Spelling::Comment - check for spelling errors in code comments

VERSION

    Version 0.004

SYNOPSIS

        use Test::Spelling::Comment;
        Test::Spelling::Comment->new->add_stopwords(<DATA>)->all_files_ok();

DESCRIPTION

    Test::Spelling::Comment lets you check the spelling of your code
    comments, and report its results in standard Test::More fashion. This
    module uses Comment::Spell::Check to do the checking, which requires a
    spellcheck program such as spell, aspell, ispell, or hunspell.

    This test is an author test and should not run on end-user
    installations. Recommendation is to put it into your xt instead of your
    t directory.

USAGE

 new( [ ARGS ] )

    Returns a new Test::Spelling::Comment instance. new takes an optional
    hash with its arguments.

        Test::Spelling::Comment->new(
            skip      => pattern,
            stopwords => Pod::Wordlist,
        );

    The following arguments are supported:

  skip (optional)

    The skip argument is either a string or an array ref of strings or
    regex patterns. Every pattern is substituted for the empty string on
    every line of the input file. This happens before passing the file over
    to Comment::Spell::Check for spell checking.

    Use this option to remove parts of the file that would otherwise
    require you to add multiple stopwords. En example would be lines like
    these:

        # vim: ts=4 sts=4 sw=4 et: syntax=perl

  stopwords (optional)

    The stopwords argument must be a Pod::Wordlist instance, or something
    compatible. You can use that argument to configure Pod::Wordlist to
    your liking.

 file_ok( FILENAME )

    file_ok will ok the test and return something true if no spelling error
    is found in the code comments. Otherwise it fails the test and returns
    something false.

 all_files_ok( [ @entries ] )

    Checks all the spelling of the code comments in all files under
    @entries by calling file_ok on every file. Directories are recursive
    searched for files. Everything not a file and not a directory (e.g. a
    symlink) is ignored. It calls done_testing or skip_all so you can't
    have already called plan.

    If @entries is empty default directories are searched for files. The
    default directories are blib, or lib if it doesn't exist, bin and
    script.

    all_files_ok returns something true if no spelling errors were found
    and false otherwise.

    Filenames ending with a ~ are always ignored.

 add_stopwords( @entries )

    Adds the words passed in @entries as stopwords. These words are not
    passed to the spell checker and are therefore accepted as correct.

    The add_stopwords method always returns $self and can therefore be used
    to chain methods together.

    This method can be called multiple times.

    This method only adds the words as passed in @entries. Unlike
    learn_stopwords from Pod::Wordlist it does not add the words plural
    too.

EXAMPLES

 Example 1 Default Usage

    Check the spelling in all files in the bin, script and lib directory.

        use 5.006;
        use strict;
        use warnings;

        use Test::Spelling::Comment 0.002;

        if ( exists $ENV{AUTOMATED_TESTING} ) {
            print "1..0 # SKIP these tests during AUTOMATED_TESTING\n";
            exit 0;
        }

        Test::Spelling::Comment->new->add_stopwords(<DATA>)->all_files_ok();

        __DATA__
        your
        stopwords
        go
        here

 Example 2 Check non-default directories or files

        use 5.006;
        use strict;
        use warnings;

        use Test::Spelling::Comment 0.002;

        if ( exists $ENV{AUTOMATED_TESTING} ) {
            print "1..0 # SKIP these tests during AUTOMATED_TESTING\n";
            exit 0;
        }

        Test::Spelling::Comment->new->all_files_ok(qw(
            corpus/hello.pl
            lib
            tools
        ));

 Example 3 Call file_ok directly

        use 5.006;
        use strict;
        use warnings;

        use Test::More 0.88;
        use Test::Spelling::Comment;

        if ( exists $ENV{AUTOMATED_TESTING} ) {
            print "1..0 # SKIP these tests during AUTOMATED_TESTING\n";
            exit 0;
        }

        my $comment = Test::Spelling::Comment->new;
        $comment->file_ok('corpus/hello.pl');
        $comment->file_ok('tools/update.pl');

        done_testing();

 Example 4 Skip vim line

    Check the spelling in all files in the bin, script and lib directory
    and remove the vim comment.

        use 5.006;
        use strict;
        use warnings;

        use Test::Spelling::Comment 0.003;

        if ( exists $ENV{AUTOMATED_TESTING} ) {
            print "1..0 # SKIP these tests during AUTOMATED_TESTING\n";
            exit 0;
        }

        Test::Spelling::Comment->new(
            skip => '^# vim: .*'
        )->add_stopwords(<DATA>)->all_files_ok();

        __DATA__
        your
        stopwords
        go
        here
