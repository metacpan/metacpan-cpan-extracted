=head1 NAME

clipfilter - Run various conversions for your clipboard data.

=head1 VERSION

version 0.30

=head1 USAGE

    # (copy some stuff)
    $ clipfilter -html
    # (paste, with html entities substituted in)

    # or URI-escaping:
    $ clipfilter -uri

    # or pipe through an arbitrary program, like `tac`, the backwards cat:
    $ clipfilter tac
    # Note: currently, this just dumps everything to open2() and reads
    # everything back. It could possibly create a deadlock, but I haven't
    # found the case that causes this, yet.

=head1 MOTIVATION

A very frequent user pattern is to copy something, edit it in some rote way,
and then paste it back. Writing your own filter scripts will make it even more
useful.

=head1 BUGS

Current weirdness when piping this to some programs, like 'wc' and 'tail'.
I will work on this.
