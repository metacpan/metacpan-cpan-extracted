=head1 NAME

KinoSearch::Search::Searcher - Base class for searching collections of documents.

=head1 DEPRECATED

The KinoSearch code base has been assimilated by the Apache L<Lucy> project.
The "KinoSearch" namespace has been deprecated, but development continues
under our new name at our new home: L<http://lucy.apache.org/>

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    # Abstract base class.



=head1 DESCRIPTION

Abstract base class for objects which search.  Core subclasses include
L<KinoSearch::Search::IndexSearcher> and
L<KinoSearch::Search::PolySearcher>.

=head1 CONSTRUCTORS

=head2 new( I<[labeled params]> )

    package MySearcher;
    use base qw( KinoSearch::Search::Searcher );
    sub new {
        my $self = shift->SUPER::new;
        ...
        return $self;
    }

Abstract constructor.

=over

=item *

B<schema> - A Schema.

=back



=head1 ABSTRACT METHODS

=head2 collect( I<[labeled params]> )

Iterate over hits, feeding them into a
L<Collector|KinoSearch::Search::Collector>.

=over

=item *

B<query> - A Query.

=item *

B<collector> - A Collector.

=back

=head2 doc_max()

Return the maximum number of docs in the collection represented by the
Searcher, which is also the highest possible internal doc id.
Documents which have been marked as deleted but not yet purged are
included in this count.

=head2 doc_freq( I<[labeled params]> )

Return the number of documents which contain the term in the given
field.

=over

=item *

B<field> - Field name.

=item *

B<term> - The term to look up.

=back

=head2 fetch_doc(doc_id)

Retrieve a document.  Throws an error if the doc id is out of range.

=over

=item *

B<doc_id> - A document id.

=back



=head1 METHODS

=head2 hits( I<[labeled params]> )

Return a Hits object containing the top results.

=over

=item *

B<query> - Either a Query object or a query string.

=item *

B<offset> - The number of most-relevant hits to discard, typically
used when "paging" through hits N at a time.  Setting
C<< offset >> to 20 and C<< num_wanted >> to 10 retrieves
hits 21-30, assuming that 30 hits can be found.

=item *

B<num_wanted> - The number of hits you would like to see after
C<< offset >> is taken into account.

=item *

B<sort_spec> - A L<KinoSearch::Search::SortSpec>, which will affect
how results are ranked and returned.

=back

=head2 glean_query(query)

If the supplied object is a Query, return it; if it's a query string,
create a QueryParser and parse it to produce a query against all
indexed fields.

=head2 get_schema()

Accessor for the object's C<< schema >> member.



=head1 INHERITANCE

KinoSearch::Search::Searcher isa L<KinoSearch::Object::Obj>.
