DESCRIPTION
    The "Archive::TarGzip" module provides "tar" subroutine to archive a
    list of files in an archive file in the tar format. The archive file may
    be optionally compressed using the gzip compression routines. The
    "Archive::TarGzip" module also provides a "untar" subroutine that can
    extract the files from the tar or tar/gzip archive files. The "tar" and
    "untar" top level subroutines use methods from the "Archive::TarGzip"
    class.

    The "Archive::TarGzip" class has many similarities to the very mature
    Archive::Tar class being at least three years older. The newer
    "Archive::TarGzip" relied very heavy on the work of the author of the
    Archive::Tar and in many instance the Archive::Tar is a better solution.

    Altough the underlying tar file format is the same and similar code is
    used to access the data in the underlying tar files, the interace
    bewteen the two are completely different. The "Archive::TarGzip" is
    built on a Tie File Handle type interface. The nthe "Archive::TarGzip"
    provide means to access individual files within the archive file without
    bringing the entire archive file into memory. When the gzip compression
    option is active, the compression is performed on the fly without
    creating an intermediate uncompressed tar file.

METHODS
  tar

     $tar_file = Archive::TarGzip->tar(@file, [\%options or\@options]);
     $tar_file = tar(@file, [\%options or\@options]); # only if imported

    The tar subroutine creates a tar archive file containing the files in
    the @file list. The name of the file is $option{tar_file}. The tar
    subroutine will enforce that the $option{tar_file} has the .tar or
    .tar.gz extensions (uses the $option{compress} to determine which one).

    The tar subroutine will add directories to the @file list in the correct
    order needed to create the directories so that they will be available to
    extract the @files files from the tar archive file.

    If the $option{src_dir} is present, the tar subroutine will change to
    the $option{src_dir} before reading the @file list. The subroutine will
    restore the original directory after processing.

    If the $option{dest_dir} is present, the tar subroutine will add the
    $option{dest_dir} to each of the files in the @file list. The
    $options{dest_dir} name is only used for the name stored in the tar
    archive file and not to access the files from the site storage.

  untar

     $success = Archive::TarGzip->untar([@file], \%options or\@options or @options);
     $success = untar([@file], \%options or\@options or @options); # only if imported

    The untar subroutine extracts directories and files from a tar archive
    file. The untar subroutine does not assume that the directories are
    stored in the correct order so that they will be present as needed to
    create the files.

    The name of the file is $option{tar_file}. If tar subroutine that cannot
    find the $option{tar_file}, it will look for file with the .tar or
    .tar.gz extension (uses the $option{compress} to determine which one).

    If the $option{dest_dir} is present, the tar subroutine will change to
    the $option{dest_dir} before extracting the files from the tar archive
    file. The subroutine will restore the original directory after
    processing.

    If the @file list is present or the @{$option{extract_file}} list is
    present, the untar subroutine will extract only the files in these
    lists.

    If the @{$option{exclude_file}} list is present, the untar subroutine
    will not extract files in this list.

  new

     $tar = new Archive::TarGzip( );
     $tar = new Archive::TarGzip( $filename or filehandle, [$compress]);

     $tar = new Archive::TarGzip( \%options or\@options);

    The new method creates a new tar object. The Archive::TarGzip::new
    method is the only methods that hides a Archive::Tar method with the
    same name.

    The new method passes $filename and $compress inputs to the
    Archive::Tar::new method which will read the entire tar archive file
    into memory.

    The new method with the $filename is better when using only the
    Archive::TarGzip methods.

  OPEN

     $tar_handle = $tar->taropen( $tar_file, $compress, [\%options or\@options]);

    The taropen method opens a $tar_file without bringing any of the files
    into memory.

    If $options{tar_flag} is '>', the taropen method creats a new $tar_file;
    otherwise, it opens the $tar_file for reading.

  PRINT

     $success = $tar->taradd($file_name, $file_contents);

    The taradd method appends $file_contents using the name $file_name to
    the end of the tar archive file taropen for writing. If $file_contents
    is undefined, the taradd method will use the contents from the file
    $file_name.

    The tarwrite method will remove the first file in the Archive::Tar
    memory and append it to the end of the tar archive file taropen for
    writing.

    The tarwrite method uses the $option{compress} to decide whether use
    gzip compress or normal writing of the tar archive file.

  READLINE

     \%tar_header = $tar->tarread(@file, [\%options or\@options]);
     \%tar_header = $tar->tarread(\%options or\@options);

    The tarread method reads the next file from the tar archive file taropen
    for reading. The tar file header and file contents are returned in the
    %tar_header hash along with other information needed for processing by
    the Archive::Tar and Archive::TarGzip classes.

    If the $option{header_only} exists the tarread method skips the file
    contents and it is not return in the %tar_header.

    If either the @file or the @{$option{extract_files}} list is present,
    the tarread method will check to see if the file is in either of these
    lists. If the file name is not in the @files list or the
    @{$option{extract_files}} list, the tarread method will set the
    $tar_header{skip_file} key and all other %tar_header keys are
    indetermined.

    If the @{$option{exclude_files}} list is present, the tarread method
    will check to see if the file is in this list. If the file name is in
    the list, the tarread method will set the $tar_header{skip_file} key and
    all other %tar_header keys are indetermined.

    If the tarread method reaches the end of the tar archive file, it will
    set the $tar_header{end_of_tar} key and all other %tar_header keys are
    indermeined.

    The $tar_header keys are as follows:

     name
     mode
     uid
     gid
     size
     mtime
     chksum
     typeflag
     linkname
     magic
     version
     uname
     gname
     devmajor
     devminor
     prefix
     error
     end_of_tar
     header_only
     skip_file
     data
     file_position

  target

     $status = $tar->target( \$buffer, $size);

    The target method gets bytes in 512 byte chunks from the tar archive
    file taropen for reading. If \$buffer is undefined, the target method
    skips over the $size bytes and any additional bytes to pad out to 512
    byte boundaries.

    The target method uses the $option{compress} to decide whether use gzip
    uncompress or normal reading of the tar archive file.

  CLOSE

     $success = $tar->CLOSE( );

    This closes the tar archive opened by the OPEN subroutine.

  parse_header

     \%tar_header = Archive::TarGzip->parse_header($buffer) ;
     \%tar_header = parse_header($buffer);  # only if imported

    The "parse_header" subroutine takes the pack 512 byte tar file header
    and parses it into a the "Archive::Tar" header hash with a few
    additional hash keys. This is the return for the "READLINE" subroutine.

QUALITY ASSURANCE
    Running the test script "TarGzip.t" verifies the requirements for this
    module. The "tmake.pl" cover script for Test::STDmaker automatically
    generated the "TarGzip.t" test script, "TarGzip.d" demo script, and
    "t::Archive::TarGzip" Software Test Description (STD) program module
    POD, from the "t::Archive::TarGzip" program module contents. The
    "tmake.pl" cover script automatically ran the "TarGzip.d" demo script
    and inserted the results into the 'DEMONSTRATION' section above. The
    "t::Tie::TarGzip" program module is in the distribution file
    Archive-TarGzip-$VERSION.tar.gz. =head1 NOTES

1.0 SCOPE
    This paragraph identifies and provides an overview of the released
    files.

  1.1 Identification

    This release, identified in 3.2, is a collection of Perl modules that
    extend the capabilities of the Perl language.

  1.2 System overview

    The Archive::TarGzip module provides tar subroutine to archive a list of
    files in an archive file in the tar format. The archve file may be
    optionally compressed using the gzip compression routines. The
    ARchive::TarGzip module also provides a untar subroutine that can
    extract the files from the tar or tar/gzip archive files.

    The tar and untar top level subroutines use methods from the
    Archive::TarGzip class. The Archive::TarGzip class is dervided from its
    parent Archive::Tar class. The new methods supplied with the
    Archive::TarGzip derived class provide means to access individual files
    within the archive file without bringing the entire archive file into
    memory. When the gzip compression option is active, the compression is
    performed on the fly without creating an intermediate uncompressed tar
    file. The new methods provide a smaller memory footprint that enhances
    performance for very large archive files.
