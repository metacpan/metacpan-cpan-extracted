0.32 2010-03-21
  - Corrected a unit test that was too strict, identified by H. Merljn Brand.
  - Added 64-bit lib directories to the dependency check. Thanks to
    H. Merljn Brand.
  - Corrected typecasting as found by Stephen Cliffe.
0.31 2009-12-22
  - R. Barrabas modified Makefile.PL to better support building on
    Strawberry Perl.
0.30 2009-12-16
  - Updated to support the Device::USB::Win32Async module.
0:29 2009-04-02
  - Corrected handling of reads when passed uninitialized 'bytes'
    variables. Thanks to William King for finding this one.
0.28 2009-02-12

0.26 2008-11-02
  - Correct skip count on test 13 to fix FreeBSD tests.
0.25 2008-10-10
  - Yet another modification to try to get the tests cleaned up for the
    CPAN Testers. Modify tests 13 and 14 to skip if no USB busses are
    found instead of failing.
0.24 2008-10-09
  - Undo a modification to the parameter handling on bulk_read and
    interrupt read. The change broke the methods completely. Thanks to
    Tony Shadwick for pointing it out.
0.23 2008-10-04
  - More documentation cleanup, including correcting the spelling of
    John Hogerhuis's name.
  - Correcting tests 15, 16, and 17 to skip if no devices are found
    instead of failing.
0.22 2008-10-02
  - Perform cleanup of tests for Mac OSX, as well as changes to clean
    code for newer Perl::Critic policies.
  - Correction to documentation of Device::USB::Device methods bulk_write
    and interrupt_write (reported by John R. Hogerhuis).
  - Modified the Inline attributes to make building under systems other
    than Linux a bit easier. (thanks to John R. Hogheruis for the insight).
  - Make creation of makefile fail if Windows and environment not properly
    set up.
0.21 2007-04-16
  - Thanks to Vadim Mikhailov for spotting a problem with use of the macro
    Inline_Stack_Vars that prevented compilation under Windows. Applied
    Vadim's patch.
0.20 2006-11-18
  - Added support for interface objects and corrected the code
    returning the code. Previous versions had only returned the first
    setting of the interface.
  - Deprecate the Device::USB::Device::config method as badly named and
    incomplete. Replaced with Device::USB::Device::configurations and
    Device::USB::Device::get_configuration.
0.19 2006-09-18
  - Modified Inline::C code to be correct C. (reported by Craig DeForest.)
  - Changes Device::USB::Device interface to automatically open the
    USB device if needed, as requested by Ray Brinzer.
0.18 2006-09-17
  - Added CLASS_* constants to the Device::USB module.
  - Added class support for the configuration objects.
  - Try again to fix assumption in tests, this time found by Ray Brinzer.
0.17 2006-09-04
  - Added FAQ document. Added new Device::USB::list_devices_if() and
    Device::USB::find_device_if() methods for more flexible device
    searching. Minor documentation cleanup.
0.16 2006-09-01
  - Modified Device::USB::list_devices() to support listing all devices.
    Thanks to Tony Awtrey for pointing this out. He also spotted an
    invalid assumption in the tests; that has been corrected.
0.15 2006-08-08
  - Applied patch from Mike McCauley that adds
    Device::USB::Device::get_driver_np() and
    Device::USB::Device::detach_kernel_driver_np() methods, as well as
    extending the debugging modes.
0.14 2006-07-10

    descriptor. Thanks to Josep Monés Teixidor for spotting it.
