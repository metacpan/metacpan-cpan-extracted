0.05    Thanks to a patch from Jos Boumans, now picks up versions 
        in the form $Foo::Bar::VERSION

0.04    One-line change to modversion so it doesn't barf if the 
        module isn't installed

0.03    Now uses File::Spec for platform independence
        (patch provided by Ville Skyttä <ville.skytta@iki.fi>)

        Included a script, "modversion", to easily find a module's
        version.

        Now sets $m->{dir} even if it can't find a version.

0.02    Removed an unnecessary debugging "print"

0.01    Original version
