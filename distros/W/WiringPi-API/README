NAME

    WiringPi::API - API for wiringPi, providing access to the Raspberry
    Pi's board, GPIO and connected peripherals

SYNOPSIS

    No matter which import option you choose, before you can start making
    calls, you must initialize the software by calling one of the setup*()
    routines.

        use WiringPi::API qw(:all)
    
        # use as a base class with OO functionality
    
        use parent 'WiringPi::API';
    
        # use in the traditional Perl OO way
    
        use WiringPi::API;
    
        my $api = WiringPi::API->new;

DESCRIPTION

    This is an XS-based module, and requires wiringPi <http://wiringpi.com>
    version 2.36+ to be installed. The wiringPiDev shared library is also
    required (for the LCD functionality), but it's installed by default
    with wiringPi.

    See the documentation on the wiringPi <http://wiringpi.com> website for
    a more in-depth description of most of the functions it provides. Some
    of the functions we've wrapped are not documented, they were just
    selectively plucked from the C code itself. Each mapped function lists
    which C function it is responsible for.

EXPORT_OK

    Exported with the :all tag, or individually.

    Perl wrapper functions for the XS functions. Not all of these are
    direct wrappers; several have additional/modified functionality than
    the wrapped versions, but are still 100% compatible.

CORE FUNCTIONS

 new()

    NOTE: After an object is created, one of the setup* methods must be
    called to initialize the Pi board.

    Returns a new WiringPi::API object.

 setup()

    Maps to int wiringPiSetup()

    Sets the pin number mapping scheme to wiringPi.

    See pinout.xyz <https://pinout.xyz/pinout/wiringpi> for a pin number
    conversion chart, or on the command line, run gpio readall.

    Note that only one of the setup*() methods should be called per program
    run.

 setup_gpio()

    Maps to int wiringPiSetupGpio()

    Sets the pin numbering scheme to GPIO.

    Personally, this is the setup routine that I always use, due to the
    GPIO numbers physically printed right on the Pi board.

 setup_phys()

    Maps to int wiringPiSetupPhys()

    Sets the pin mapping to use the physical pin position number on the
    board.

 setup_sys()

    Maps to int wiringPiSetupSys()

    DEPRECATED.

    This function is here for legacy purposes only, to provide non-root
    user access to the GPIO. It required exporting the pins manually before
    use. wiringPi now uses /dev/gpiomem by default, which does not require
    root level access.

    Sets the pin numbering scheme to GPIO.

 pin_mode($pin, $mode)

    Maps to void pinMode(int pin, int mode)

    Puts the pin in either INPUT or OUTPUT mode.

LCD FUNCTIONS

    There are several methods to drive standard Liquid Crystal Displays.
    See wiringPiDev LCD page <http://wiringpi.com/dev-lib/lcd-library/> for
    full details.

 lcd_init(%args)

    Maps to:

        int lcdInit(
            rows, cols, bits, rs, strb,
            d0, d1, d2, d3, d4, d5, d6, d7
        );

    Initializes the LCD library, and returns an integer representing the
    handle (file descriptor) of the device.

    Parameters:

        %args = (
            rows => $num,       # number of rows. eg: 2 or 4
            cols => $num,       # number of columns. eg: 16 or 20
            bits => 4|8,        # width of the interface (4 or 8)
            rs => $pin_num,     # pin number of the LCD's RS pin
            strb => $pin_num,   # pin number of the LCD's strobe (E) pin

            ...
            d7 => $pin_num,     # pin number for LCD data pin 8
        );

    Mandatory: All entries must have a value. If you're only using four (4)
    bit width, d4 through d7 must be set to 0.

    Note: When in 4-bit mode, the d0 through 3 parameters actually map to
    pins d4 through d7 on the LCD board, so you need to connect those pins
    to their respective selected GPIO pins.

 lcd_home($fd)

    Maps to void lcdHome(int fd)

    Moves the LCD cursor to the home position (top row, leftmost column).

    Parameters:

    (0).

 lcd_send_cmd($fd, $command)

    Maps to void lcdSendCommand(int fd, char command)

    Sends any arbitrary command to the LCD.

    Parameters:

        $fd

    Mandatory: The file descriptor integer returned by lcd_init().

        $command

    Mandatory: A command to submit to the LCD.

 lcd_position($fd, $x, $y)

    Maps to void lcdPosition(int fd, int x, int y)

    Moves the cursor to the specified position on the LCD display.

    Parameters:

        $fd

    Mandatory: The file descriptor integer returned by lcd_init().

        $x

    Mandatory: Column position. 0 is the left-most edge.

        $y

    Mandatory: Row position. 0 is the top row.

 lcd_char_def($fd, $index, $data)

    Maps to void lcdCharDef(int fd, unsigned char data [8]). This function
    is

    This allows you to re-define one of the 8 user-definable characters in
    the display.

    Parameters:

        $fd

    Mandatory: The file descriptor integer returned by lcd_init().

        $index

    Mandatory: Index of the display character. Values are 0-7. Once the
    char is stored at this index, it can be used at any time with the
    lcd_put_char() function.

        $data

    Mandatory: Array reference of exactly 8 elements. Each element is a
    single unsigned char byte. These bytes represent the character from the
    top-line to the bottom line.

    Note that the characters are actually 5 x 8, so only the lower 5 bits
    are of each element are used (ie. `0b11111` or 0b00011111`). The index
    is from 0 to 7 and you can subsequently print the character defined
    using the lcdPutchar() call using the same index sent in to this
    function.

 lcd_put_char($fd, $char)

    Maps to void lcdPutChar(int fd, unsigned char data)

    Writes a single ASCII character to the LCD display, at the current
    cursor position.

    Parameters:

        $fd

    Mandatory: The file descriptor integer returned by lcd_init().

        $char

    Mandatory: The character byte to print to the LCD. Note that 0-7 are
    reserved for custom characters, as defined with lcd_char_def(). To
    print one of your custom chars, $char should be the same integer of the
    $index you used to store it in that function.

 lcd_puts($fd, $string)

    Maps to void lcdPuts(int fd, char *string)

    Writes a string to the LCD display, at the current cursor position.

    Parameters:

        $fd

    Mandatory: The file descriptor integer returned by lcd_init().

        $string

    Mandatory: A string to display.

SOFT PWM FUNCTIONS

    Note: The software PWM functionality is experimental, and from what
    I've tested, not very reliable, so I'd stay away from this at this
    time.

    Software Pulse Width Modulation is not the same as hardware PWM. It
    should not be used for critical things as it's frequency isn't 100%
    stable.

    This software PWM allows you to use PWM on ANY GPIO pin, not just the
    single hardware pin available.

 soft_pwm_create($pin, $initial_value, $range)

    Creates a new software PWM thread that runs outside of your main
    application.

    Parameters:

        $pin

    Mandatory: The pin number, in the pin numbering scheme dictated by
    whichever setup*() routine you used.

        $initial_value

    Optional: A value between 0 and $range.

        $range

    Optional: Look at this like a dial. We start at 0 and the dial has
    turned completely when we hit the $range integer. If not sent in,
    defaults to 1023.

 soft_pwm_write($pin, $value)

    Sets the HIGH frequency on pin to whatever is in $value. The value must
    be lower than what was set in the $range parameter to
    soft_pwm_create().

 soft_pwm_stop($pin)

    Turns off software PWM on the $pin.

INTERRUPT FUNCTIONS

 set_interrupt($pin, $edge, $callback)

    IMPORTANT: The interrupt functionality requires that your Perl can be
    used in pthreads. If you do not have a threaded Perl, the program will
    cause a segmentation fault.

    Wrapper around wiringPi's wiringPiISR() that allows you to send in the
    name of a Perl sub in your own code that will be called if an interrupt
    is triggered.

    Parameters:

        $pin

    Mandatory: The pin number, in the pin numbering scheme dictated by
    whichever setup*() routine you used.

        $edge

    Mandatory: 1 (lowering), 2 (raising) or 3 (both).

        $callback

    Mandatory: The string name of a subroutine previously written in your
    user code that will be called when the interrupt is triggered. This is
    your interrupt handler.

ADC FUNCTIONS

    Analog to digital converters (ADC) allow you to read analog data on the
    Raspberry Pi, as the Pi doesn't have any analog input pins.

    This section is broken down by type/model.

 ADS1115 MODEL

  ads1115_setup($pin_base, $addr)

    Maps to `ads1115Setup(int pinBase, int addr)`.

    The ADS1115 is a four channel, 16-bit wide ADC.

    Parameters:

        $pin_base

    Mandatory: Signed integer, higher than that of all GPIO pins. This is
    the base number we'll use to access the pseudo pins on the ADC.
    Example: If 400 is sent in, ADC pin A0 (or 0) will be pin 400, and AD3
    (the fourth analog pin) will be 403.

    Parameters:

        $addr

    Mandatory: Signed integer. This parameter depends on how you have the
    ADDR pin on the ADC connected to the Pi. Below is a chart showing if
    the ADDR pin is connected to the Pi Pin, you'll get the address. You
    can also use i2cdetect -y 1 to find out your ADC address.

        Pin     Address
        ---------------
        Gnd     0x48
        VDD     0x49
        SDA     0x4A
        SCL     0x4B

SHIFT REGISTER FUNCTIONS

    Shift registers allow you to add extra output pins by multiplexing a
    small number of GPIO.

    Currently, we support the SR74HC595 unit, which provides eight outputs
    by using only three GPIO. To further, this particular unit can be daisy
    chained up to four wide to provide an additional 32 outputs using the
    same three GPIO pins.

 shift_reg_setup

    This function configures the Raspberry Pi to use a shift register (The
    SR74HC595 is currently supported).

    Parameters:

        $pin_base

    Mandatory: Signed integer, higher than that of all existing GPIO pins.
    This parameter registers pin 0 on the shift register to an internal
    GPIO pin number. For example, setting this to 100, you will be able to
    access the first output on the register as GPIO 100 in all other
    functions.

        $num_pins

    Mandatory: Signed integer, the number of outputs on the shift register.
    For a single SR74HC595, this is eight. If you were to daisy chain two
    together, this parameter would be 16.

        $data_pin

    Mandatory: Integer, the GPIO pin number connected to the register's DS
    pin (14). Can be any GPIO pin capable of output.

        $clock_pin

    Mandatory: Integer, the GPIO pin number connected to the register's
    SHCP pin (11). Can be any GPIO pin capable of output.

        $latch_pin

    Mandatory: Integer, the GPIO pin number connected to the register's
    STCP pin (12). Can be any GPIO pin capable of output.

I2C FUNCTIONS

    These functions allow you to read and write devices on the
    Inter-Integrated Circuit (I2C) bus.

 i2c_setup($addr)

    Maps to int wiringPiI2CSetup(int devId)

    Configures the I2C bus in preparation for communicating with a device.

    Parameters:

        $addr

    Mandatory: Integer, the address of your device as seen by running for
    example: i2cdetect -y 1.

 i2c_interface($device, $addr)

    Maps to iint wiringPiI2CSetupInterface(const char* device, int devId)

    This feature is not implemented currently, and will be used to select
    different I2C interfaces if the RPi ever receives them.

 i2c_read($fd)

    Performs a quick one-off, one-byte read without needing to specify the
    register value. Some very simple devices operate without register
    values needed.

    Parameters:

        $fd

    Mandatory: Integer, the file descriptor that was returned from
    i2c_setup().

    Returns: A single byte of data from the device on the I2C bus.

    Mandatory: Integer, the file descriptor that was returned from
    i2c_setup().

        $reg

    Mandatory: Integer, the register to read data from.

    Returns: A single byte of data from the device on the I2C bus from the
    selected register.

 i2c_read_word($fd, $reg)

    Reads two bytes from the specified register.

    Parameters:

        $fd

    Mandatory: Integer, the file descriptor that was returned from
    i2c_setup().

        $reg

    Mandatory: Integer, the register to read data from.

    Returns: Integer, two bytes of data from the device on the I2C bus from
    the selected register.

 i2c_write($fd, $data)

    Performs a quick one-off, one-byte write without needing to specify the
    register value. Some very simple devices operate without register
    values needed.

    Parameters:

        $fd

    Mandatory: Integer, the file descriptor that was returned from
    i2c_setup().

        $data

    Mandatory: Integer, the value to write to the device.

    Returns: The value of the ioctl() call, 0 on success.

 i2c_write_byte($fd, $reg, $data)

    Writes a single byte to the register specified.

    Parameters:

        $fd

    i2c_setup().

        $reg

    Mandatory: Integer, the register to write the data to.

        $data

        $data

    Mandatory: Integer, the value to write to the device.

    Returns: The value of the ioctl() call, 0 on success.

SPI FUNCTIONS

    These functions allow you to set up and read/write to devices on the
    serial peripheral interface (SPI) bus.

 spi_setup

    Maps to int wiringPiSPISetup(int channel, int speed)

    Configure the SPI bus for use to communicate with its connected
    devices.

    Parameters:

        $channel

    Mandatory: Integer, the SPI channel the device is connected to. 0 for
    channel /dev/spidev0.0 and 1 for channel /dev/spidev0.1.

        $speed

    Optional: Integer, the speed for SPI communication. Defaults to 1000000
    (1MHz).

    Note that it's wise to do some error checking when attempting to open
    the SPI bus. We return the return value of an ioctl() call, so this
    does the trick:

        if ((spi_setup(0, 1000000) < 0){
            die "failed to open the SPI bus...\n";
        }

 spi_data

    Maps to: int spiDataRW(int channel, AV* data, int len), which calls int
    wiringPiSPIDataRW(int channel, unsigned char* data, int len).

    Writes, and then reads a block of data over the SPI bus. The read
    following the write is read into the transmit buffer, so it'll be
    overwritten and sent back as a Perl array.

    Parameters:

        $channel

    Mandatory: Integer, the SPI channel the device is connected to. 0 for
    channel /dev/spidev0.0 and 1 for channel /dev/spidev0.1.

        $data

    Mandatory: An array reference, with each element containing a single
    unsigned 8-bit byte that you want to write to the device. If you want
    to read-only, send in an aref with all the elements set to 0. These
    will be overwritten with the read data, and sent back as a Perl array.

        $len

    Mandatory: Integer, the number of bytes contained in the $data
    parameter array reference that will be sent to the device. I could just
    count the number of elements, but this keeps things consistent, and
    ensures the user is fully aware of the data they are sending on the
    bus.

    Returns a Perl array containing the same number of elements you sent
    in.

        # read-only... three bytes
    
        my $buf = [0x00, 0x00, 0x00];
    
        my @ret = spiDataRW($chan, $buf, 3);

BMP180 PRESSURE SENSOR FUNCTIONS

    These functions configure and fetch data from the BMP180 barometric
    pressure sensor.

 bmp180_setup($pin_base)

    Configures the system to read from a BMP180 pressure sensor.

    These functions can not return the raw values from the sensor. See each
    function documentation to learn how to do so.

    Parameters:

        $pin_base

    Mandatory: Integer, the number at which to place the pseudo analog pins
    in the GPIO stack. For example, if you use 200, pin 200 represents the
    temperature feature of the sensor, and 201 represents the pressure
    feature.

    Return: undef.

 bmp180_temp($pin, $want)

    Returns the temperature from the sensor.

    Parameters:

        $pin

    Mandatory: Integer, represents the $pin_base used in the setup function
    + 0.

        $want

    Optional: 'c' for Celcius, and 'f' for Farenheit. Defaults to 'f'.

    Return: A floating point number in the requested conversion.

    NOTE: To get the raw sensor temperature, call the C function
    bmp180Temp($pin) directly.

 bmp180_pressure($pin)

    Returns the current air pressure in kPa.

    Parameters:

        $pin

    Mandatory: Integer, represents the $pin_base used in the setup function
    + 1.

    Return: A floating point number that represents the air pressure in
    kPa.

    NOTE: To get the raw sensor pressure, call the C function
    bmp180Pressure($pin) directly.

DEVELOPER FUNCTIONS

    These functions are under testing, or don't potentially have a use to
    the end user. They may be risky to use, so use at your own risk.

    The functions in this section do not have a Perl wrapper equivalent.

 pseudoPinsSetup(int pinBase)

    This function allocates shared memory for the pseudo pins used to
    communicate with devices that are beyond the reach of the Pi's GPIO
    (eg: shift registers, ADCs etc).

    Parameters:

        pinBase

    Mandatory: Integer, larger than the highest GPIO pin number. Eg: 500
    will be the base for the analog pins on an ADS1115 ADC. Pin A0 would be
    500, and ADC pin A3 would be 503.

 pinModeAlt(int pin, int mode)

    Undocumented function that allows any pin to be set to any mode.

    Parameters:

        pin

    Mandatory: Signed integer, any valid GPIO pin number.

        mode

    Mandatory: Signed integer, any valid wiringPi pin mode.

 digitalWriteByte(const int value)

    Writes an 8-bit byte to the first eight GPIO pins.

    Parameters:

        value

    Mandatory: Unsigned int, the byte value you want to send in.

    Return: void

 digitalWriteByte2(const int value)

    Same as "digitalWriteByte(const int value)", but writes to the second
    group of eight GPIO pins.

 digitalReadByte()

    Reads an 8-bit byte from the first eight GPIO pins on the Pi.

    Takes no parameters, returns the byte value as an unsigned int.

 digitalReadByte2()

    Same as "digitalReadByte", but reads from the second group of eight
    GPIO pins.
