Changelog for Yancy-Backend-Static

0.007     2019-09-13 23:09:59-05:00 America/Chicago

    [Fixed]

    - Fixed paths ending in an extension not working. Thanks @wbazant!
      [Github #3]

0.006     2019-09-04 21:08:57-05:00 America/Chicago

    [Fixed]

    - Correctly decode Markdown files as UTF-8 so that high-byte
      characters render properly on the webapp. Thanks @wbazant!
      [Github #2]

0.005     2019-08-20 20:41:57-05:00 America/Chicago

    [Fixed]

    - Fixed relative links on index files. Browsers require a trailing
      slash to correctly resolve relative links, so this backend no
      longer allows directories without a trailing slash.

0.004     2019-07-06 18:55:13-05:00 America/Chicago

    [Added]

    - Added better support for search and ordering in the `list`
      function. This is provided directly by Yancy::Util's `match` and
      `order_by` functions, so any improvements to those will improve
      this.

0.003     2019-04-25 09:50:29+01:00 Europe/London

    [Fixed]

    - Fixed a missing prereq reported by CPANTS. Thanks @manwar!
      [Github #1]

0.002     2019-04-25 09:44:47+01:00 Europe/London

    [Fixed]

    - Fixed `set()` not working with Yancy::Command::backend::copy. The
      `set()` method now can create new files with the given ID, and
      should probably be preferred to `create()` (which does not require
      an ID, but uses the `path` attribute).

0.001     2019-04-19 17:05:22-05:00 America/Chicago

    - Initial release
    - Basic support for Markdown pages
