    Pre-YAPC release
    trace wasn't exportable, now it is.

0.07 - Wed Aug  1              2007
    Speed.
    API Change.

      The trace callback recieves only the numeric pointer of the op
      now. Future versions will be given a B::OP object. ATM,
      marshalling the pointer to a B::OP object is your
      responsibility.

      The number is also the same scalar all the time. References
      taken to it will only reflect the last used value.
