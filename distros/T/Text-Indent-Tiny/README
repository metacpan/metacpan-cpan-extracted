NAME
    Text::Indent::Tiny - tiny and flexible indentation across modules

VERSION
    This module version is 0.1.0.

SYNOPSIS
    Simple usage:

            use Text::Indent::Tiny;

            my $indent = Text::Indent::Tiny->new(
                    eol     => 1,
                    size    => 1,
                    level   => 2,
            );

    Cross-module usage:

            use Text::Indent::Tiny (
                    eol     => 1,
                    size    => 1,
                    level   => 2,
            );

            my $indent = Text::Indent::Tiny->instance;

    Another and more realistic way of the cross-module usage:

            use Text::Indent::Tiny;

            my $indent = Text::Indent::Tiny->instance(
                    eol     => 1,
                    size    => 1,
                    level   => 2,
            );

DESCRIPTION
    The module is designed to be used for printing indentation in the
    simplest way as much as possible. It provides methods for turning on/off
    indentation and output using the current indentation.

    The module design was invented during discussion on the PerlMonks board
    at <https://perlmonks.org/?node_id=1205367>. Monks suggested to name the
    methods for increasing and decreasing indents in the POD-like style.
    Also they inspired to "use overload".

INSTANTIATING
  Constructor new()
    The constructor is used for creating the indentaion object. If you need
    to use indentaion in one style across modules, initialize the indent
    object in the main program and instatiate it in other modules with the
    method instance().

    To construct a new Text::Indent::Tiny object, invoke the new method
    passing the following options as a hash:

    level
        The initial indentation level. Defaults to 0 (meaning no indent).
        The specified initial level means the left edge which cannot be
        crossed at all. So any any indents will be estimated from this
        level.

    size
        The number of indent spaces used for each level of indentation. If
        not specified, the $Text::Indent::Tiny::DefaultSize is used.

    tab The flag to use "TAB" as indent.

    text
        The arbitrary text that is assumed to be indentation.

    eol If specified, tell the item method to add automatically new lines to
        the input arguments.

    The options text, tab and size have impact on the same stuff. When
    specified, text has the highest priority. If tab is specified, it
    cancels size and any other characters in favor of "TAB".

  Singleton instance()
    This method returns the current object instance or create a new one by
    calling the constructor. In fact, it implements a singleton restricting
    the only instance across a program and its modules. It allows the same
    set of arguments as the constructor.

METHODS
    The following methods are used for handling with indents: increasing,
    decreasing, resetting them and applying indents to strings.

    There are two naming styles. The first one is a POD-like style, the
    second one is more usual.

    Calling the methods in a void context is applied to the instance itself.
    If the methods are invoked in the scalar context, a new instance is
    created in this context and changes are applied for this instance only.
    See for details the Examples 1 and 2.

  over(), increase()
    Increase the indentation by one or more levels. Defaults to 1.

  back(), decrease()
    Decrease the indentation by one or more levels. Defaults to 1.

  cut(), reset()
    Reset all indentations to the initial level (as it has been set in the
    cunstructor).

  item()
    This method returns all arguments indented. Accordingly the eol option
    and the configured $\ variable it appends all but last arguments with
    new line.

  Example
            use Text::Indent::Tiny;
            my $indent = Text::Indent::Tiny->new;

            # Let's use newline per each item
            $\ = "\n";

            # No indent
            print $indent->item("Poem begins");

            # Indent each line with 4 spaces (by default)
            $indent->over;
            print $indent->item(
                    "To be or not to be",
                    "That is the question",
            );
            $indent->back;

            # Indent the particular line locally to 5th level (with 20 spaces)
            print $indent->over(5)->item("William Shakespeare");

            # No indent
            print $indent->item("Poem ends");

VARIABLES
    $Text::Indent::Tiny::DefaultSpace
        The text to be used for indentation. Defaults to one "SPACE"
        character.

    $Text::Indent::Tiny::DefaultSize
        The number of indent spaces used for each level of indentation.
        Defaults to 4.

OVERLOADING
    Some one could find more convenient using the indents as objects of
    arithmetic operations and/or concatenated strings.

    The module overloads the following operations:

    ""  Stringify the indentation.

    "+" Increase the indentation.

    "-" Decrease the indentation.

    "." The same as "$indent->item()".

  Example
    So using the overloading the above example can looks more expressive:

            use Text::Indent::Tiny;
            my $indent = Text::Indent::Tiny->new;

            # Let's use newline per each item
            $\ = "\n";

            # No indent
            print $indent . "Poem begins";

            # Indent each line with 4 spaces (by default)
            print $indent + 1 . [
                    "To be or not to be",
                    "That is the question",
            ];

            # Indent the particular line locally to 5th level (with 20 spaces)
            print $indent + 5 . "William Shakespeare";

            # No indent
            print $indent . "Poem ends";
