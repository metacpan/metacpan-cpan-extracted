Revision history for Perl extension Template::Plugin::TagRescue

0.06  Sun Apr  3 07:26:05 2005
        - Changed escape_method() back into a faster version under mod_perl.

0.05  Sun Apr  3 06:25:30 2005
        - Fixed bug that the characters except for <, >, &, and " were encoded
          by using &HTML::Entities::encode_entities. Because second argument wasn't passed.
          Now my escape_html function works properly.
          This is the same as &Template::Filters::html_filter.
          (Thanks to Yasuhiro Horiuchi)
