NAME
    Catalyst::Model::SVN - Catalyst Model to browse Subversion repositories

SYNOPSIS
        # Model
        __PACKAGE__->config(
            repository => '/path/to/svn/root/or/path'
        );

        # Controller
        sub default : Private {
            my ($self, $c) = @_;
            my $path = join('/', $c->req->args);
            my $revision = $c->req->param('revision') || 'HEAD';

            $c->stash->{'repository_revision'} = MyApp::M::SVN->revision;
            $c->stash->{'items'} = MyApp::M::SVN->ls($path, $revision);

            $c->stash->{'template'} = 'blog.tt';
        };

DESCRIPTION
    This model class uses the perl-subversion bindings to access a
    Subversion repository and list items and view their contents. It is
    currently only a read-only client but may expand to be a fill fledged
    client at a later time.

CONFIG
    The following configuration options are available:

  repository
    Returns a URI object of the full path to the root of, or any directory
    in your Subversion repository. This can be one of http://, svn://, or
    file:/// schemes.

    This value comes from the config key 'repository'.

  revision
    This is the default revision to use when no revision is specified. By
    default, this will be "HEAD".

METHODS
  cat($path [, $revision])
    Returns the contents of the path specified. If "path" is a copy, the
    logs are transversed to find original. The request is then reissued for
    the original path for the "revision" specified.

  ls($path [, $revision])
    Returns a array of Catalyst::Model::SVN::Item objects in list context,
    each representing an entry in the specified repository path. In scalar
    context, it returns an array reference. If "path" is a copy, the logs
    are transversed to find the original. The request is then reissued for
    the original path for the "revision" specified.

  propget($path, $propname [, $revision])
    Returns a specific property for a path at a specified revision name.

    Note: This method is inefficient, if you want to extract multiple
    properties of a single item then use the props_hr method.

  properties_hr($path [, $revision])
    Returns a reference to a hash with all the properties set on an object
    at a specific revision.

  repository
    Returns the repository specified in the configuration "repository"
    option.

  revision
    Returns the latest revisions of the repository you are connected to.
