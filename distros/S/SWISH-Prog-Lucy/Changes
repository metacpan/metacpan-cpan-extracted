   turned on.

0.16 12 Feb 2013

   MetaNames dynamically. Requires SWISH::3 1.000006.

0.15 10 Feb 2013
 - refactored internal initialization of query parser, adding qp_config

   UndefinedMetaTags is set to 'auto' in the Indexer, and additional fields

0.14 04 Feb 2013
 - include built-in swish* properties as search-able fields.

0.13 30 Jan 2013

   been in there since 0.08 but not needed unless we are running under NFS.

0.12 29 Nov 2012
 - support stale searcher detection when multiple indexes are being
   searched.

0.11 3 Sept 2012
 - refer to header meta file internally using official API method
 - added Indexer->abort method

0.10 23 Aug 2012
 - croak_on_error => 1 in Search::Query::Parser means invalid queries now
   generate an exception in Searcher.
 - Result->score will always return a positive integer (score || 1)

0.09 28 July 2012
 - add property_map to respect PropertyNameAlias params in get_property()
 - fix MANIFEST to include missing Module::Install files

   Swish-e v 2.x FuzzyIndexingMode.

0.04 10 Sept 2011
 - add highlightable_fields feature to expose the highlightable attribute
   of Lucy FullTextField objects.
 - add find_relevant_fields feature to locate the fields that matched the
   query. Depends upon highlightable_fields being set to true.

0.03 28 June 2011
 - no functional changes, just bumped version because SWISH::Prog 0.51 had
   not been released prior to 0.02 and all the failing test reports are
   misleading.

0.02 23 June 2011
 - Fix bad s/ks/lucy/ strings from initial port.
 - bump SWISH::Prog dependency

0.01 21 June 2011
 - Initial release, based on SWISH::Prog::KSx.
