NAME
    WWW::Patent::Page - get a patent page or document (e.g. htm, pdf, tif)
    from selected source (e.g. from United States Patent and Trademark
    Office (USPTO) website or the European Patent Office (ESPACE_EP). and
    place into a WWW::Patent::Page::Response object)

SYNOPSIS
    Please see the test suite for working examples. The following is not
    guaranteed to be working or up-to-date.

      $ perl -I. -MWWW::Patent::Page -e 'print $WWW::Patent::Page::VERSION,"\n"'
      0.02

      $ perl get_patent.pl US6123456 > US6123456.pdf &

      (web fetcher is included in examples)

      use WWW::Patent::Page;

      print $WWW::Patent::Page::VERSION,"\n";

      my $patent_document = WWW::Patent::Page->new(); # new object

      my $document1 = $patent_document->get_page('6,123,456');
            # defaults:
            #       office  => 'ESPACE_EP',
            #           country => 'US',
            #           format      => 'pdf',
            #               page    => undef ,
            # and usual defaults of LWP::UserAgent (subclassed)

      my $document2 = $patent_document->get_page('US6123456',
                            office  => 'ESPACE_EP' ,
                            format  => 'pdf',
                            page    => 2 ,  #get only the second page
                            );

      my $pages_known = $document2->get_parameter('pages');  #how many total pages known?

DESCRIPTION
      Intent:  Use public sources to retrieve patent documents such as
      TIFF images of patent pages, html of patents, pdf, xml, etc.
      Expandable for your office of interest by writing new submodules.
      Alpha release by newbie to find if there is any interest.

USAGE
      See also SYNOPSIS above

    Install prerequisites before testing.  Testing will fail without prerequisites.
    Do not report failures to CPAN TESTERs without installing prerequisites.
    Edit 200_micropatent.t with your username and password before testing.


         Standard process for building & installing modules:

              perl Build.PL
              ./Build
              ./Build test
              ./Build install

              or

              perl Makefile.PL
              make
              make test TEST_VERBOSE=1
              make install

    Examples of use:

      $patent_browser = WWW::Patent::Page->new(
                            doc_id  => 'US6,654,321',
                            office  => 'ESPACE_EP' ,
                            format  => 'pdf',
                            page    => undef ,  # returns all pages in one pdf
                            agent   => 'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.4b) Gecko/20030516 Mozilla Firebird/0.6',
                            );

            $patent_response = $patent_browser->get_patent('US6,654,321(B2)issued_2_Okada');

BUGS
    Pre-alpha release, to gauge whether the perl community has any interest.

    Code contributions, suggestions, and critiques are welcome.

    Error handling is undeveloped.

    By definition, a non-trivial program contains bugs.

    For United States Patents (US) via the USPTO (us), the 'kind' is ignored
    in method provide_doc

Subroutines
  new
    NEW instance of the Page class, subclassing LWP::UserAgent

    usually countries; country_known returns undef if the two letter acronym
    is not recognized.

  parse_doc_id
    Takes a human readable patent/publication identifier and parses it into
    country/entity, kind, number, type, ...
