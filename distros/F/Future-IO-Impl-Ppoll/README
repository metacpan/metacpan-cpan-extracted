NAME

    Future::IO::Impl::Ppoll - implement Future::IO using ppoll(2)

DESCRIPTION

    This module provides an implementation for Future::IO which uses the
    ppoll(2) Linux system call, via IO::Ppoll.

    There are no additional methods to use in this module; it simply has to
    be loaded, and it will provide the Future::IO implementation methods:

       use Future::IO;
       use Future::IO::Impl::Ppoll;
    
       my $f = Future::IO->sleep(5);
       ...

    Note that the waitpid method will take over the operation of
    $SIG{CHLD}, and will print a warning if it discovers some other code
    has already set it. Make sure not to otherwise override this signal
    handler in your program, or else the waitpid futures will stop working.
