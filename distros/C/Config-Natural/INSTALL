INSTALLATION NOTES
    
    This module can be installed using two methods. Choose whichever 
    fits your configuration or your taste. 

    The Flashy New Way
    ------------------
    You can use Module::Build, the pure Perl installation method, 
    by striking the following keys on your keyboard: 
    
      $ perl Build.PL
      $ ./Build test
      $ ./Build install


    The Good Old Way
    ----------------
    The brave ExtUtils::MakeMaker can still be used by simply typing 
    the following commands:
    
      $ perl Makefile.PL
      $ make
      $ make install
    
    and everything should work fine. 
    
    
    Examples
    --------
    You can find some examples in the directory with that name. 
    You can also take a look at some of the test scripts. 


    Retro-Compatibility
    -------------------
    Before being publied on the CPAN, this module was called Data::Config. 
    The compat/ directory contains instructions to install a module that 
    maintain compatibility with programs that still use the old name.
