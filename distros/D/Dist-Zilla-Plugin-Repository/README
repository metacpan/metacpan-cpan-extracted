NAME
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Repository - Automatically sets repository URL from
    svn/svk/Git checkout for Dist::Zilla

VERSION
    version 0.20

SYNOPSIS
        # dist.ini
        [Repository]

DESCRIPTION
    The code is mostly a copy-paste of Module::Install::Repository

  ATTRIBUTES
    *   git_remote

        This is the name of the remote to use for the public repository (if
        you use Git). By default, unsurprisingly, to origin.

    *   github_http

        This attribute is deprecated. If the remote is a GitHub repository,
        list only the https url
        (https://github.com/fayland/dist-zilla-plugin-repository) and not
        the actual clonable url
        (git://github.com/fayland/dist-zilla-plugin-repository.git). This
        used to default to true, but as of 0.16 it defaults to false.

        The CPAN Meta 2 spec defines separate keys for the clonable "url"
        and web front-end "web". The Meta 1 specs allowed only 1 URL. If you
        set "github_http" to true, the "url" key will be removed from the v2
        metadata, and the v1 metadata will then use the "web" key.

        Instead of setting "github_http", you should use the MetaJSON plugin
        to include a v2 META.json file with both URLs.

    *   repository

        You can set this attribute if you want a specific repository instead
        of the plugin to auto-identify your repository.

        An example would be if you're releasing a module from your fork, and
        you don't want it to identify your fork, so you can specify the
        repository explicitly.

        In the Meta 2 spec, this is the "url" key.

    *   type

        This should be the (lower-case) name of the most common program used
        to work with the repository, e.g. git, svn, cvs, darcs, bzr or hg.
        It's normally determined automatically, but you can override it.

    *   web

        This is a URL pointing to a human-usable web front-end for the
        repository. Currently, only Github repositories get this set
        automatically.
