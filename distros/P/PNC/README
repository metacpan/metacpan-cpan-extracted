WARNING

This warning is from Simon Cozens' Finance::Bank::LloydsTSB, and seems
just as apt here.

This is code for online banking, and that means your money, and
that means BE CAREFUL. You are encouraged, nay, expected, to audit
the source of this module yourself to reassure yourself that I am not
doing anything untoward with your banking data. This software is useful
to me, but is provided under NO GUARANTEE, explicit or implied.

THANKS

Leon Cowle for Finance::Bank::ABSA as this code is based upon his which
was based upon the following people's code.

Chris Ball for Finance::Bank::HSBC, upon which a lot of this code is
based. Also to Simon Cozens for Finance::Bank::LloydsTSB, upon which
most of Finance::Bank::HSBC is based, Andy Lester (and Skud, by continuation)
for WWW::Mechanize, Gisle Aas for HTML::TokeParser.
