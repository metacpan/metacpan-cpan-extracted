NAME
    Catalyst::Plugin::Params::Nested - Nested form parameters (ala Ruby on
    Rails).

SYNOPSIS
        use Catalyst qw/Params::Nested/;

        # using this html

        <form ...>
            <!-- can be with either subscripted or dot notation -->
            <input name="foo[bar]" ... />
            <input name="foo.gorch" ... />
        </form>

        # turns params into hashrefs:

        $c->req->param('foo')->{bar};

        $c->req->params({
            # extra params
            foo => {
                bar => ...,
                gorch => ...
            },

            # original params untouched
            'foo[bar]' => ...,
            'foo.gorch' => ...,
        });

DESCRIPTION
    Ruby on Rails has a nice feature to create nested parameters that help
    with the organization of data in a form - parameters can be an
    arbitrarily deep nested structure.

    The way this structure is denoted is that when you construct a form the
    field names have a special syntax which is parsed.

    This plugin supports two syntaxes:

    dot notation
            <input name="foo.bar.gorch" />

    subscript notation
            <input name="foo[bar][gorch]" />

    When reading query parameters from "$c->req" you can now access the all
    the items starting with "foo" as one entity using
    "$c->req->param('foo');". Each subitem, denoted by either the dot or the
    square brackets, will be returned as a further deeper hashref.

INTERNAL METHODS
    prepare_uploads
        Overrides "prepare_uploads" in Catalyst to expand the parameter data
        structure post factum.

CAVEATS
    No attempt is made to merge data intelligently. If you do this:

        <input name="foo" />
        <input name="foo.bar" />

    the "foo" parameter will stay untouched, and you'll have to access
    "foo.bar" using its full string name:

        $c->req->param("foo.bar");
