NAME
    Test::Rinci - Test Rinci metadata

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.150 of Test::Rinci (from Perl
    distribution Test-Rinci), released on 2018-09-10.

SYNOPSIS
    To check all metadata in a module:

     use Test::Rinci tests=>1;
     metadata_in_module_ok("Foo::Bar", {opt => ...}, $msg);

    Alternatively, you can check all metadata in all modules in a distro:

     # save in release-rinci.t, put in distro's t/ subdirectory
     use Test::More;
     plan skip_all => "Not release testing" unless $ENV{RELEASE_TESTING};
     eval "use Test::Rinci";
     plan skip_all => "Test::Rinci required for testing Rinci metadata" if $@;
     metadata_in_all_modules_ok({opt => ...}, $msg);

DESCRIPTION
    This module performs various checks on a module's Rinci metadata. It is
    recommended that you include something like "release-rinci.t" in your
    distribution if you add metadata to your code. If you use Dist::Zilla to
    build your distribution, there is Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Test::Rinci to
    make it easy to do so.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

FUNCTIONS
    All these functions are exported by default.

  metadata_in_module_ok($module [, \%opts ] [, $msg])
    Load $module, get its metadata, and perform test on all of them. For
    function metadata, a wrapping to the function is done to see if it can
    be wrapped.

    Available options:

    *   test_package_metadata => BOOL (default: 1)

        Whether to test package metadata found in module.

    *   exclude_packages => REGEX/ARRAY

        List of packages to exclude from testing.

    *   test_function_metadata => BOOL (default: 1)

        Whether to test function metadata found in module. Currently require
        "wrap_function" option to be turned on, as the tests are done to the
        metadata generated by the wrapper (for convenience, since the
        wrapper can convert old v1.0 metadata to v1.1).

    *   wrap_function => BOOL (default: 1)

        Whether to wrap function (using Perinci::Sub::Wrapper). All tests
        which run module's functions require this option to be turned on.

    *   test_function_examples => BOOL (default: 1)

        Whether to test examples in function metadata, by running each
        example and comparing the specified result with actual result. Will
        only take effect when "test_function_metadata" and "wrap_functions"
        is turned on.

    *   exclude_functions => REGEX/ARRAY

        List of functions to exclude from testing.

    *   test_variable_metadata => BOOL (default: 1)

        Whether to test function metadata found in module.

    *   exclude_variables => REGEX/ARRAY

        List of variables to exclude from testing.

  metadata_in_all_modules_ok([ \%opts ] [, $msg])
    Look for modules in directory "lib" (or "blib" instead, if it exists),
    and "run metadata_in_module_ok()" on each of them.

    Options are the same as in "metadata_in_module_ok()".
