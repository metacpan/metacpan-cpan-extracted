NAME

Pod::Simple::FromTree - parse POD from tree form

DESCRIPTION

This is a subclass of Pod::Simple, intended to be further subclassed.
Objects of this class, as with Pod::Simple, can parse a POD document,
internally using an event-based protocol, and subclasses are expected
to add specific behaviour to do something with the events.  This class
provides a method to parse from an existing parse tree, of the type
that Pod::Simple::SimpleTree generates.  (The basic Pod::Simple can only
parse from POD source, either in a file or in a Perl string.)

Not only can this class be directly subclassed, but it can also be mixed
into an existing subclass of Pod::Simple.  For example, a class that
inherits from this class and Pod::Man (which is a subclass of Pod::Simple)
can accept a POD parse tree and render it as man page nroff source.
Class::Mix provides a mechanism to generate such mixed classes on demand.

Processing POD from the parse tree form is useful in almost any
non-trivial workflow.  Most obviously, it is useful if automatic or
structured editing of the POD is desired, which is most easily performed
on the parse tree form of the document.  It is also an efficiency
improvement if the same document is to be rendered in more than one
form: the POD source can be parsed once to generate a parse tree (using
Pod::Simple::SimpleTree), and then the parse tree rendered multiple times
(using subclasses of this class).
