NAME
    Message::Passing::Output::WebHooks - call 'WebHooks' with messages.

SYNOPSIS
        message-pass_webhooks --input STDIN

        You type:
        {"url": "http://localhost:5000/test","@type":"WebHooks","data":{"foo":"bar"}}

        Causes:

        POST /test HTTP/1.1
        Host: localhost:5000
        Content-Length: 13
        Content-Type: application/json

        {"foo":"bar"}

        # Consume messages from ZeroMQ, and publish results to
        # ZeroMQ:
        message-pass_webhooks --input ZeroMQ --input_options \
            '{"socket_bind":"tcp://*:5558"}' --log ZeroMQ \
            --log_options '{"connect":"tcp://192.168.0.1:5559"}'

WHAT IS A WEBHOOK
    A web-hook is an a notification method used by APIs.

    The idea is that you (as a client) define a URI on your website which is
    called when a certain action happens at your API provider. Some data
    relevant to the event is serialized out to you, allowing you to take
    action.

    The canonical example is PayPal's IPN system, in which PayPal make a
    call to your online payment system to verify that a payment has been
    made.

DESCRIPTION
    This class expects to have it's consume method called with a has of
    parameters, including:

    url The URL to make the request to.

    data
        The data to serialize out to the HTTP post request

USAGE
    As a Message::Passing component, input is easy - if you're writing
    asynchronous perl code already, you can use the
    Message::Passing::Output::WebHooks class directly in your perl code, or
    you can use Log::Dispatch::Message::Passing to divert your application
    logs into it via the Log::Dispatch framework.

    If you're not already an AnyEvent perl app (most people!), then you can
    use Message::Passing::Input::STDIN, Message::Passing::Input::ZeroMQ or
    any other input class, and the command line message-pass utility
    supplied to run a worker process, then send messages to it.

    To send messages, you can either use Java or Ruby logstash
    <http://logstash.net/>, or if you're in perl, then it's entirely
    possible to use the ZeroMQ output component,
    Message::Passing::Output::ZeroMQ from within a normal perl application
    (via Log::Dispatch::Message::Passing or directly).

LOGGING
    This output publishes one message for each message received, logging the
    status of the HTTP call after it completes.

    The log output can be setup on command line as documented in the
    SYNOPSIS, or if you're building classes manually, you can supply the
    "log_chain" attribute yourself.

    Events that can be logged are:

  Message::Passing::WebHooks::Event::Bad.
    The message received was missing either a " url " or a " data " field,
    meaning it could not be used for a HTTP request.

  Message::Passing::WebHooks::Event::Call::Success.
    The call succeeded, and a 2XX status was received from the remote server

  Message::Passing::WebHooks::Event::Call::Failure.
    The call failed, due to a bad server or the server returning an error
    status.

  Message::Passing::WebHooks::Event::Call::Timeout.
    The remote server failed to respond within the timeout configured so the
    request was aborted.

ATTRIBUTES
  log_chain
    Holds a chain of Message::Passing filters and outputs.

    Defaults to Message::Passing::Output::Null, causing all status reports
    to be discarded.

  timeout
    Integer number of seconds, after which HTTP connections are timed out.

METHODS
  consume
    Generates and sends the post request from the message passed.
