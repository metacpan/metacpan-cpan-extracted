Revision history for Perl distribution RandomJungle
Latest version of this distribution:
$VERSION = 0.05

0.05 Fri Nov 30 00:30:00 2012
    - Updated RandomJungle::File::DB to improve performance.  Retrieval of large
      arrays from DBM::Deep is slow.  The lists of variable labels, sample labels,
      and tree IDs are now stored internally as a concatenated string rather than
      as an array of individual elements.  No change to the respective accessor
      methods or their return values.
    - Updated RandomJungle::Tree to improve performance.  Added the skip_validation
      parameter to classify_data() to avoid an unnecessary performance hit when
      using data known to be valid.
    - Updated Tree_01.t to reflect the addition to classify_data().
