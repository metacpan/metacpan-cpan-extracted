NAME
    Number::Format::FixedLocale - a Number::Format that ignores the system
    locale

VERSION
    version 1.121780

SYNOPSIS
        use Number::Format::FixedLocale;
        my $f = Number::Format::FixedLocale->new(
            -mon_thousands_sep => '.',
            -mon_decimal_point => ',',
            -int_curr_symbol   => 'EUR',
            -n_cs_precedes     => 0,
            -p_cs_precedes     => 0,
        );
        print $f->format_price( -45208.23 ); # "-45.208,23 EUR"

DESCRIPTION
    Number::Format is a very useful module, however in environments with
    many systems it can be a liability due to the fact that it gathers its
    default settings from the system locale, which can lead to surprising
    results when formatting numbers in production.

    Number::Format::FixedLocale is a sub-class of Number::Format that
    contains only a slightly modified constructor, which will only use a
    fixed set of en_US default settings. Thus any results from this module
    will be predictable no matter how the system it is being run on is
    configured.
