=head1 NAME

OpenTracing::Batch - represents a group of zero or more spans

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A batch of spans is used for submitting results to an opentracing endpoint.

Once you've created a batch, take a look at L</new_span> and the L<OpenTracing::SpanProxy>
class.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 process

Returns the L<OpenTracing::Process> that this batch applies to. Each batch is
submitted from a single process.

=head2 spans

Returns an arrayref of L<OpenTracing::Span> instances.

=head2 span_list

Returns a list of L<OpenTracing::Span> instances.

=head2 add_span

Adds a new L<OpenTracing::Span> instance to this batch.

=head2 new_span

Creates a new L<OpenTracing::Span>, adds it to this batch, and returns an
L<OpenTracing::SpanProxy> instance (which will automatically mark the end
of the span when it's destroyed).

This is most likely to be the method you'll want for working with spans
in user code.

=head2 DESTROY

Triggers callbacks when the batch is discarded. Normally used by the transport
mechanism to ensure that the batch is sent over to the tracing endpoint.
