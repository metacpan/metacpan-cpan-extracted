This module is an object interface to the Quick Mail Transfer
Protocol (QMTP). QMTP is a replacement for the Simple Mail Transfer
Protocol (SMTP). It offers increased speed, especially over high
latency links, pipelining, 8-bit data transmission and predeclaration
of line-ending encoding.

See the Net::QMTP man page that was installed with this module for
information on how to use it in your perl programs. You require version
0.04 or later of the Text::Netstring module.

Net::QMTP installs without any black magic:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install

'make test' will output some errors (``Socket is not defined at t/qmtp.t
line...''). That's intentional (some of the tests verify that things
that should cause errors do just that).
