  * Skip 0.102 because I didn't realize i bumped it in the repo before, but claim it's because we skipped liburing-2.12
  * Update to liburing-2.13

0.100 2025-05-30 09:21:00 EST
  * Updated liburing from 0.8 PREVIEW to liburing 2.10
  * Removed supplimentary library that was never fully used
    as it was needed by an unfinished an unreleased FFI::IOUring.
    This should now be easier to update and make work for IO::Uring
    instead.

  - Fix some issues with gcc and linking.  I hate gcc.

  - Create supplimental library that contains missing functions.  
    These are functions that are only present in the liburing.h file 
    that are marked as static inline.  This make sense in C since 
    their all small tiny functions that just make things more ergonomic 
    or help setup structs but we need them as real functions to help from perl.
  - Do some clean up of the dist.ini and bump it's revision of starter

  - Update to a preview of 0.8 of liburing, to get some of the 5.11 support.  Might not work but it contains lots of fixes since 0.7

  - Updated dist.ini for easier publishing
  - Moved the OS check to dist.ini instead of alienfile, should behave better now on cpantesters
  - Add all exported symbols to the tests
