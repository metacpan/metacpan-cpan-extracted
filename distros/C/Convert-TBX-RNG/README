NAME
    Convert::TBX::RNG - Create an RNG to validate a TBX dialect

VERSION
    version 0.04

DESCRIPTION
    This module creates RNG files for validating TBX dialects. Currently,
    the user can generate RNG using XCS files, but in the future there may
    be functionality for tweaking the core structure.

SYNOPSIS
    use Convert::TBX::RNG qw(generate_rng);
    my $rng = generate_rng(xcs_file => '/path/to/xcs');
    print $$rng;
METHODS
  "generate_rng"
    Creates an RNG representation of this dialect and returns it in a string
    pointer.

    Currently one argument is requried: "xcs_file", which specifies the
    location of an XCS file which defines the desired dialect.

  "core_structure_rng"
    Returns a pointer to a string containing the TBX core structure (version
    2) RNG. This RNG file has been edited to make processing by this module
    easier, but it still properly validates the core structure of a TBX
    file.

GOTCHAS
    RNG does not validate IDREF attributes, unlike DTD. Therefore, you will
    not be able to check that target attributes refer to actual IDs within
    the file.

    Most of the functionality of the produced RNG files matches the TBX
    Checker exactly; however, some features remain unimplemented in the
    TBXChecker, and so behavior may not always match.

FUTURE WORK
    Currently, nothing is done to check the validity of ref objects; the RNG
    validates only their core structure.

    In the future we may provide functionality to tweak the TBX core
    structure.

    Other features and documentation to help validate TBX documents can be
