Revision history for JMAP-Tester

0.104     2025-06-11 13:28:56-04:00 America/New_York
        - add a TO_JSON method to the Sentence class
        - include ->sentences, not ->items in default diagnostics (which allows
          smarter diagnostic dumpers to filter based on the class)

0.103     2023-01-11 21:24:00-05:00 America/New_York
        - update distribution metadata
        - bump required Perl to v5.14.0

0.102     2022-07-25 10:45:39-04:00 America/New_York
        - allow subclasses to change how JWT-authenticated links work
          (you probably don't need this!)
        - Stop acting like JMAP sessions contain an authenticationUri, because
          they don't!  This means: don't change the $tester->authentication_uri
          to be whatever you find in the client session.  You'll never find a
          defined value, which means you'll clobber the correctly-set value
          from initialization.

0.101     2021-08-13 11:02:38-04:00 America/New_York
        - work around bugs in older Role::Tiny; this is what you want if you
          saw: Can't use string ("-1") as a symbol ref

0.100     2021-08-10 12:11:55-04:00 America/New_York
        - [ THIS UPDATE MIGHT BREAK YOUR CODE ]
        - The $jtester->ua object is now a "UA" object, not just an
          LWP::UserAgent.  This allows the use of other user agents.  More
          importantly, the tester can be configured to return Futures instead
          of immediate responses, which means it can be operated in
          non-blocking mode.  If you have been interacting with the result of
          ->ua directly, you should read the details of its new interface in
          JMAP::Tester::Role::UA and then update your code.

          output to the numeric file descriptor

          These methods should make it easier to bootstrap your tester from a
          running server.

          index is out of range
        - Results now have ->assert_successful, which returns the Result or
          aborts

        - the Authorization header is now set only on specific requests, not on
          every request made by the tester's user agent
        - simple authentication has been fixed; it was totally broken in the
          last release

0.009     2017-01-28 13:54:00-05:00 America/New_York
        - an abort is now issued on bogus paragraphs and non-contiguous use of
          a client id; we can roll this back in the future if someone has a
          need… but why would you?
        - Set sentences now have an assert_no_errors method that throws a
          error-dumping abort if any part of the setFoos method did not succeed

        - $set->VERB_errors now always returns an empty hashref if there are

        - simple_auth should now, uh, work
        - some internal exceptions now throw JMAP::Tester::Abort errors,
          for use with Test::Abortable
        - "Set" sentences now understand new-style Object values for "updated"
          and provide transparent access to both new- and old-style updated
