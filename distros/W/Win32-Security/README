NAME
    "Win32::Security::NamedObject" - Security manipulation for named objects

SYNOPSIS
            use Win32::Security::NamedObject;

            my $noFoo = Win32::Security::NamedObject->('FILE', "C:\\Foo\\foo.txt");
            my $dacl = $noFoo->dacl();
            print $dacl->dump();

DESCRIPTION
    This module provide an object-oriented interface for manipulating
    security information on named objects (i.e. files, registry keys, etc.).
    Note that, like the rest of "Win32-Security", it currently only provides
    support for files. It has been architected to eventually support all
    object types supported by the "GetNamedSecurityInfo" Win32 API call.
    Also, it currently only supports access to the DACL and Owner
    information - SACL access will come later.

  Installation instructions
    "Win32::Security::NamedObject" installs as part of "Win32-Security" and
    depends upon the other modules in the distribution. There are three
    options for installing this distribution:

    *   Using "Module::Build 0.24" or later:

          Build.PL
          perl build test
          perl build install

        See "TESTING" for more information about enabling the more extensive
        test suite.

    *   Using the PPM (the file has the extension ".ppm.zip") on CPAN and
        installing under ActivePerl for Win32 by unzipping the ".ppm.zip"
        file and then:

          ppm install Win32-Security.ppd

    *   Installing manually by copying the "*.pm" files in
        "lib\Win32\Security" to "Perl\site\lib\Win32\Security" and the
        "*.pl" files in "script" to "Perl\bin".

  Dependencies
    The suite of "Win32-Security" modules depends upon:

    "Class::Prototyped" 0.98 or later
        Support for prototype-based programming in Perl.
        "Win32::Security::ACE" uses this to programmatically generate large
        number of classes that use multiple-inheritance.
        "Win32::Security::ACL" and "Win32::Security::NamedObject" use this
        to support programmatic generation of classes that interact with the
        "Win32::Security::ACE" classes. "Win32::Security::Recursor" uses
        this to allow for flexible behavior modification (since
        "Win32::Security::Recursor" objects are really behavioral, not
        stateful).

    "Data::BitMask" 0.13 or later
        Flexible support for manipulating masks and constants.

    "Win32::API"
        Support for making arbitrary Win32 API calls from Perl. There is no
        C code anywhere in "Win32-Security". "Win32::API" is why.

    All of the above modules should be available on CPAN, and also via PPM.

"Win32-Security" MODULES
  "Win32::Security::SID"
    "Win32::Security::SID" provides a set of functions for doing SID
    manipulation (binary to text and vice-versa) as well as wrappers around
    "Win32::LookupAccountName" and "Win32::LookupAccountSID" that make them
    friendlier.

  "Win32::Security::Raw"
    "Win32::Security::Raw" provides a number of function wrappers around a
    number of Win32 API calls. Each wrapper wraps around a single Win32 API
    call and provides rudimentary data structure marshalling and parsing.
    This is the only module that uses "Win32::API" to make API calls - all
    of the other modules make their API calls through the wrappers provided
    by this module.

  "Win32::Security::ACE"
    "Win32::Security::ACE" provides an object-oriented interface for
    parsing, creating, and manipulating Access Control Entries (ACEs).

  "Win32::Security::ACL"
    "Win32::Security::ACE" provides an object-oriented interface for
    manipulating Access Control Lists (ACLs).

  "Win32::Security::NamedObject"
    "Win32::Security::NamedObject" provides support for accessing and
    modifying the security information attached to Named Objects.

  "Win32::Security::Recursor"
    "Win32::Security::Recursor" provides support for recursing through trees
    of Named Objects and inspecting and/or modifying the security settings
    for those objects.

"Win32-Security" SCRIPTS
    Provided for your use are a few utilities that make use of the above
    modules. These scripts were the raison d'etre for the modules, and so it
    seemed justifiable to ship them with it. The scripts should be
    automatically installed to "Perl\bin", so if "perl.exe" is in your path,
    these scripts should be in your path as well (i.e. you should be able to
    type ""PermDump.pl -h"" at the command prompt). The scripts have
    documentation (use the "-h" option), but here is a quick overview of
    them so that you don't overlook them.

  "PermDump.pl"
    This utility dumps permissions on files. It supports distinguishing
    between inherited and explicit permissions along with determining when
    there are problems with inherited permissions. It has a number of
    options, and it's designed to output in either TDF or CSV format for
    easy parsing and viewing.

    I would personally recommend that all system administrators set up a
    nightly task to dump all the permissions on shared server volumes to a
    text file. This makes it easy to recover should you make a mistake while
    doing permissions manipulation, and it also gives you a searchable file
    for looking for permissions without waiting for the script to dump
    permissions. While the script is very fast and generally scans several
    hundred files per second, if you have a volume with hundreds of
    thousands of files, it can still take a while to run. Such a command
    line might look like:

      PermDump.pl -c -r D:\Shared > D:\Shared_Perms.csv

    or, if you want the paths to be relative:

      D: && cd D:\Shared && PermDump.pl -c -r . > D:\Shared_Perms.csv

  "PermFix.pl"
    WARNING: This utility is in beta. It has not undergone extensive testing
    yet, and the test suite for this script is still under development. I
    strongly encourage users to use "PermDump.pl" to take a snapshot of the
    existing permissions before using this script in case there are
    problems, and to examine the resulting permissions closely for signs of
    error.

    This utility is designed to do one simple task: fix problems with
    inherited permissions resulting from files and/or folders being moved
    between two folders on the same volume that have differing inheritable
    permissions.

  "PermChg.pl"
    WARNING: This utility is in beta. It has not undergone extensive testing
    yet, and the test suite for this script is still under development. I
    strongly encourage users to use "PermDump.pl" to take a snapshot of the
    existing permissions before using this script in case there are
    problems, and to examine the resulting permissions closely for signs of
    error.

    NOTES: The owner modification support in the script is not yet finished.
    Also, the "-file" option has not had very extensive testing.

    This utility is the counterpart to "PermDump.pl". It allows you to
    change the permissions. Unlike "X?CACLS.EXE", this utility properly
    understands and interacts with inherited permissions. It supports two
    modes for specifying permissions. The first allows you to specify
    permissions using the command line much like "X?CACLS.EXE". The second
    allows you to pass the permissions in a text file using the same format
    as is outputted by "PermDump.pl".

    Say you get a call from an executive insisting that Jane be given access
    to everything that John currently has access to. The first step is to
    make Jane a member of all of the groups that John is in, but that
    doesn't address explicitly assigned permissions. To deal with that, dump
    all the permissions on the volume using "PermDump.pl". Open the file up
    in Excel and sort on the Trustee. Copy the lines for John into another
    spreadsheet and replace the Trustee name with Jane's. Then pass that
    into "PermChg.pl" with the "-file" option and you're done!

TESTING
    For a set of modules like Win32-Security that are intended to interact
    with permissions, the only way to really test them is to have them
    interact with real permissions. Unfortunately, the only viable to do
    that is to modify a live filesystem and see what happens. However, I
    felt uncomfortable running such tests as part of a default test suite,
    so I have disabled them by default.

    The tests in question are in the "t\extended.t" and "t\scripts.t" files.
    They create a single directory in "%TEMP%" named
    "Win32-Security_TestDir_$$" (where $$ is the process ID>. They create
    directories and files in that test directory and apply permissions to
    them. The tests require "CACLS.EXE" (which should be present on all
    Windows 2000/XP/2003 installs) and that a usable version of "perl.exe"
    be in the path.

    The tests take a while to run (five minutes on my 1.8 GHz machine)
    because they are very extensive (7500+ tests in "extended.t" alone), but
    I strongly urge you to consider running them and reporting any errors.

    To enable them, open "t\extended.t" and "t\scripts.t" and change line 11
    in each to read ""$enabled = 1;"". I strongly encourage testing using
    every OS you plan to use the modules with, and using both privileged and
    non-privileged accounts.

ARCHITECTURE
    "Win32::Security::NamedObject" uses the same class architecture as
    "Win32::Security::ACL". Unlike "Win32::Security::ACE" and
    "Win32::Security::ACL", it doesn't use the flyweight design pattern.
    (For obvious reasons - you're unlikely to create multiple
    "Win32::Security::NamedObject" objects for the same thing!)

Method Reference
  "new"
    This creates a new "Win32::Security::NamedObject" object.

    The various calling forms are:

    * "Win32::Security::NamedObject->new($objectType, $objectName)"
    * ""Win32::Security::NamedObject::$objectType"->new($objectName)"

    Note that when using $objectType in the package name, the value needs to
    be canonicalized (i.e. "SE_FILE_OBJECT", not the shortcut "FILE"). If
    the $objectType has already been canonicalized, improved performance can
    be realized by making the call on the fully-qualified package name and
    thus avoiding the call to redo the canonicalization. Aliases are
    permitted when $objectName is passed as a parameter.

    The currently permitted objectName formats (text copied from
    http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/securit
    y/security/se_object_type.asp ) are:

    "SE_FILE_OBJECT"
        Indicates a file or directory. The name string that identifies a
        file or directory object can be:

        *   A relative path, such as "abc.dat" or "..\\abc.dat"

        *   An absolute path, such as "\\abc.dat", "c:\\dir1\\abc.dat", or
            "g:\\remote_dir\\abc.dat"

        *   A UNC name, such as "\\\\computer_name\\share_name\\abc.dat"

        *   A local file system root, such as "\\\\\\\\.\\\\c:". Security
            set on a file system root does not persist when the system is
            restarted

    "SE_REGISTRY_KEY"
        Indicates a registry key. A registry key object can be in the local
        registry, such as "CLASSES_ROOT\\some_path"; or in a remote
        registry, such as "\\\\computer_name\\CLASSES_ROOT\\some_path". The
        names of registry keys must use the following literal strings to
        identify the predefined registry keys: "CLASSES_ROOT",
        "CURRENT_USER", "MACHINE", and "USERS".

        In addition, the following literal strings will be mapped to the
        legal literals:

        *   "HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT" -> "CLASSES_ROOT"

        *   "HKEY_CURRENT_USER" -> "CURRENT_USER"

        *   "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE" -> "MACHINE"

        *   "HKEY_USERS" -> "USERS"

  "dbmObjectType"
    Returns the "Data::BitMask" object for interacting with Object Types

    See "Win32::Security::ACE->dbmObjectType()" for more explanation.

  "objectType"
    Returns the type of object to which the ACE is or should be attached.

  "objectName"
    Returns the name of the object.

  "dacl"
    Gets or sets the DACL for the object. If no parameters are passed, it
    reads the DACL for the object and returns a "Win32::Security::ACL" class
    object. To set the DACL, pass the desired "Win32::Security::ACL" for the
    object and an optional "SECURITY_INFORMATION" mask for specifying the
    bits "UNPROTECTED_DACL_SECURITY_INFORMATION" or
    "PROTECTED_DACL_SECURITY_INFORMATION". If the
    "UNPROTECTED_DACL_SECURITY_INFORMATION" is set, then permissions are
    inherited. If "PROTECTED_DACL_SECURITY_INFORMATION" is set, then
    permissions are NOT inherited (i.e. inheritance is blocked). If neither
    is set, then the existing setting is maintained.

    Be forewarned that when setting the DACL, under Windows 2000 and more
    recent OSes, the call to "SetNamedSecurityInfo" results in the automatic
    propagation of inheritable ACEs to existing child objects (see
    http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/securit
    y/securi ty/setnamedsecurityinfo.asp for more information). This does
    not happen under Windows NT, and if you need propagation of inheritable
    permissions under Windows NT, you need to write your own code to
    implement that. Under OSes that support automatic propagation, the call
    to set a DACL can take a very long time to return if there are a lot of
    child objects! Finally, any errors in the inherited DACLs buried in the
    tree will be automatically fixed by this call, constrained by the
    privileges of the account executing the code.

    When setting the DACL under Windows 2000 and more recent OSes, if
    "UNPROTECTED_DACL_SECURITY_INFORMATION" is specified, or if the
    "SECURITY_INFORMATION" mask is unspecified and the object is currently
    inheriting permissions, then any ACEs in the passed DACL that have the
    "INHERITED_ACE" bit set in "aceFlags" are automatically ignored. The OS
    will automatically propagate the inheritable ACEs and will only
    explicitly set those ACEs in the passed DACL that do not have the
    "INHERITED_ACE" bit set in "aceFlags".

    If "PROTECTED_DACL_SECURITY_INFORMATION" is specified, or if the
    "SECURITY_INFORMATION" mask is unspecified and the object is currently
    blocking inherited permissions, than the "INHERITED_ACE" bit in
    "aceFlags" for all ACEs in the passed DACL is automatically cleared.
    That is to say, all passed ACEs are treated as explicit, independent of
    the "INHERITED_ACE" bit in "aceFlags".

  "ownerTrustee"
    Gets or sets the Trustee for the Owner of the object. If no parameters
    are passed, it reads the Owner for the object and returns a Trustee
    name. To set the Owner, pass the desired Trustee. It calls "ownerSid",
    so see that method for information on "SeRestorePrivilege".

  "ownerSid"
    Gets or sets the binary SID for the Owner of the object. If no
    parameters are passed, it reads the Owner for the object and returns a
    binary SID. To set the Owner, pass the desired binary SID. The first
    time this is called in set mode, it will attempt to enable the
    "SeRestorePrivilege", which permits setting the Owner of an object to
    anyone. If this fails, the call will "croak".

  "control"
    Returns the "Data::BitMask::break_mask" form of the Security Descriptor
    Control (i.e. a hash containing all matching constants for the control
    mask of the SD).

  "fixDacl"
    Fixes the inherited ACEs in the DACL. See the caveats concerning setting
    DACLS using "dacl" for further information.
