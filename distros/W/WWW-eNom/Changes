Revision history for WWW-eNom

v2.6.0   2016-12-07
    - Workaround issue with old private nameservers having multiple ip addresses
      (even though this is no longer allowed).  Just use the first ip address.

v2.5.0   2016-11-30
    - Implemented Support for eNom's DA based IRTP Implementation, introduced
      WWW::eNom::IRTPDetail

v2.4.1   2016-11-18
    - If the domain is expired, use false for the autorenew status since
      eNom refuses to give it to you (and if it's expired, it's pretty
      obvious that auto renew isn't on)

v2.4.0    2016-11-17
    - If the domain is expired, use [ ] for the nameservers since eNom
      refuses to give them to you

v2.3.0    2016-10-05
    - Better handling of Reseller information used for Contacts
    - If a domain is not explictly unverified, count is as verified (due to
      how eNom responds, we have to assume "no news is good news").

v2.2.0    2016-10-02
    - Implemented method to email a domain's EPP Key to the Registrant
      Contact assoicated with the domain.

v2.1.0    2016-09-02
    - Added support for updating the IP of a Private Nameserver

v2.0.0    2016-08-22
    * MAJOR RELEASE *

    - While preserving backwards compatibility, introduced a new Moose
      driven architecture.  This abstracts most of eNom API methods behind
      a set of easy to use Models (instead of Hashes) and a Command
      Pattern for performing eNom Operations (instead of having to
      understand exactly how the eNom API Works)
    - Extensive documentation for working with eNom for Domain Operations
