This is the README for Acme::Include::Data version 0.05.

Acme::Include::Data is a "module" for the Perl computer programming
language, a library of computer code to install on a computer.  This
document contains four sections:

1. About - what the module does

2. Documentation - how to learn more about the module

3. Installation - how to install this module on a computer

4. Help - what to do if you get stuck

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. ABOUT

Acme::Include::Data - how to include data files with a CPAN module

This is a demonstration module which demonstrates how to include a
data file with a Perl module and how to read it in at run time.

If you are a CPAN author or use the CPAN-style tools to distribute
your data, you may have wondered how to include data with your Perl
distribution.

Any file under lib in the distribution is bundled into the
distribution by "Makefile.PL". So if your distribution is called
"Acme::Include::Data", then a file called
"lib/Acme/Include/this-is-a-data-file.txt" is automatically included
into the distribution.

To read the data file in, simply use __FILE__: 

    my $data = __FILE__;
    
    # Make whatever substitutions are necessary:
    
    $data =~ s/Data\.pm$/this-is-a-data-file.txt/;
    
    # Read the data in:
    
    open my $in, "<", $data or die $!;
    my $text = '';
    while (<$in>) {
        $text .= $_;
    }
    

(This example is included as "read-data.pl" in the distribution.)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. DOCUMENTATION

You can read the documentation for the module online at the following
websites:

    * http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Acme::Include::Data
    * http://metacpan.org/release/Acme-Include-Data

(These links go to the latest version of the module.)

After installing the module, you can read the documentation on your
computer using

    perldoc Acme::Include::Data

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. INSTALLATION

This module requires Perl version 5.6.0 or later.

To install the module from CPAN, use

    cpan Acme::Include::Data

If you have the App::cpanminus installer, you may prefer

    cpanm Acme::Include::Data

To install the module from the source file, Acme-Include-Data-0.05.tar.gz,
follow this sequence of commands:

    tar xfz Acme-Include-Data-0.05.tar.gz
    cd Acme-Include-Data-0.05
    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make install

If you want to test the module before installing it, use "make test" after
"make" and before "make install".

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
