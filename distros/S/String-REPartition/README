README for String::REPartition

			    String::REPartition

String::REPartition exports a function for generating regular expressions
used to partition data sets

PREREQUISITES

This module requires Perl 5; I've only used it under Perl 5.005, so for
anything lower, you're on your own.

String::REPartition doesn't use any nonstandard modules.

INSTALLATION

You install String::REPartition, as you would install any perl module
library, by running these commands:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

If you want to install a private copy of String::REPartition in your home
directory, then you should try to produce the initial Makefile with
something like this command:

  perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=~/perl

DOCUMENTATION

POD-format documentation is included in REPartition.pm.  POD is readable
with the 'perldoc' utility.
