Revision history for Perl extension VMS::Process.

0.01  Thu Sep 18 12:22:04 1997
	- Copied over from VMS::ProcInfo. (Yes, I know they're not all that
      similar. It was a place to start)

0.02  Mon Sep 22 11:40:04 1997
    - Added support for passing an array ref to process_list()
    - Added support in for handling COMPARISON and MODIFIER elements
    - Added in enum support, so you can pass names to STATE, MODE, and
      JOBTYPE.

0.03  Tue Sep 23 10:00:00 1997
    - Took the pre and * things out of COMPARISONS and put 'em in
      MODIFIERS where they really belong.

1.00  Mon Sep 29 11:31:00 1997
    - Made a few tweaks to get it to compile and run properly on an OpenVMS
      Alpha 6.2 cluster system. Seems to be release quality, so it is.

1.01  Tue Nov 25 17:50:00 1997
    - Started the merge of Process and ProcInfo.
    - Fixed some typos in the README
    - Disabled the tied hash and object interfaces for right now, until I
      can get them better sorted out.

1.02  Wed Nov 26 8:19:03 1997
    - It's alive! Final debugging and testing, and it works. Function only,
      but it's a darned good start, I think.

1.03  Wed Nov 26 8:57:12 1997
    - Can't resist tweaking some. Made doc changes to Process.PM

1.04  Thu Jan 15 14:17:43 1998
    - Forgot DFWSCNT! How could I have forgotten that? :) Added it in.
    - Minor doc tweak. (Took out mention of ProcInfo, which has gone away)

1.05  Tue May 26 13:15:43 1998
    - Tweaked some for Vax builds. (#ifdef'd out all the references to
      Quadwords and __int64s)

1.06  Fri Oct 02 20:43:03 1998
    - Fixed up the item pre-clear code in process_list
    - Fixed another dopey programming error that filled in the wrong SV in
      some cases. (Duh!)
    Both these fixes courtesy of Sebastian Bazley.

1.07 Sat Apr 11 09:44:00 2009
    - Changed C<#ifdef __ALPHA> to C<#ifndef __VAX> so we can run on OpenVMS I64.
    - Modernized a few global variables (e.g., sv_yes -> PL_sv_yes).

1.08 Sat Apr 11 10:11:00 2009
    - PAUSE refused to index 1.07

1.09 Mon Jun 17 20:50:00 2013
    - Dodge memory leak by mortalizing AllPurposeHV.
