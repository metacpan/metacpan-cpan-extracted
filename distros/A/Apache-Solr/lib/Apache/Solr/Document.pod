=head1 NAME

Apache::Solr::Document - Apache Solr (Lucene) Document container

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  # create and upload a new document
  my $doc = Apache::Solr::Document->new(...);
  $doc->addField(id => 'tic');
  $doc->addFields( {name => 'tac', foot => 'toe'}, boost => 2);

  $solr->addDocument($doc, commit => 1, overwrite => 1)

  # take results
  my $results = $solr->select
    ( q  => 'text:gold'             # search text-fields for 'gold'
    , hl => { field => 'content' }  # highlight 'gold' in content'
    );

  my $doc = $results->selected(3);  # fourth answer
  print $doc->rank;                 # 3

  print $doc->uniqueId;             # usually the 'id' field

  @names = $doc->fieldNames;
  print $doc->field('subject')->{content};
  print $doc->content('subject');   # same
  print $doc->_subject;             # same, via autoload (mind the '_'!)

  my $hl  = $results->highlighted($doc);  # another ::Doc object
  print $hl->_content;              # highlighted field named 'content'

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This object wraps-up an document: a set of fields.  Either, this
is a document which has to be added to the Solr database using
L<Apache::Solr::addDocument()|Apache::Solr/"Updates">, or the subset of a document as returned
by L<Apache::Solr::select()|Apache::Solr/"Search">.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 Constructors

=over 4

=item Apache::Solr::Document-E<gt>B<fromResult>(HASH, $rank)

Create a document object from data received as result of a select
search.

=item Apache::Solr::Document-E<gt>B<new>(%options)

 -Option--Default
  boost   1.0
  fields  {}

=over 2

=item boost => FLOAT

Boost the preference for hits in this document.

=item fields => HASH|ARRAY

Passed to L<addFields()|Apache::Solr::Document/"Accessors">.

=head2 Accessors

=over 4

=item $obj-E<gt>B<addField>($name, $content, %options)

$content can be specified as SCALAR (reference) for performance. In
that case, a reference to the original will be kept.  When C<undef>,
the field gets ignored.

 -Option--Default
  boost   1.0
  update  undef

=over 2

=item boost => FLOAT

=item update => 'add'|'set'|'inc'|...

[1.02, Solr 4.0]  See 'Atomic Updates' in
F<https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/solr/Updating+Parts+of+Documents>

=back

=item $obj-E<gt>B<addFields>(HASH|ARRAY, %options)

The HASH or ARRAY containing NAME/CONTENT pairs.
The %options are passed L<addField()|Apache::Solr::Document/"Accessors"> as %options.

=item $obj-E<gt>B<boost>( [$fieldname, [$boost]] )

Boost value for all fields in the document.

[0.93] When a FIELD NAME is given, the boost specific for that field is
returned (not looking at the document's boost value)  This can also be
used to set the $boost value for the field.

=item $obj-E<gt>B<content>($name)

Returns the content of the first field with $name.

=item $obj-E<gt>B<field>($name)

Returns the first field with $name (or undef).  This is a HASH, containing
C<name>, C<content> and sometimes a C<boost> key.

If you need the content (that's the usually the case), you can also
(probably more readible) use the (autoloaded) method NAMEd after the
field with a leading '_'.

example: 

   $doc->field('subject')->{content};
   $doc->content('subject');
   $doc->_subject;

=item $obj-E<gt>B<fieldNames>()

All used unique names.

=item $obj-E<gt>B<fields>( [$name] )

Returns a list of HASHs, each containing at least a C<name> and a
C<content>.  Each HASH will also contain a C<boost> value.  When a $name
is provided, only those fields are returned.

=item $obj-E<gt>B<rank>()

Only defined when the document contains results of a search: the ranking.
A value of '0' means "best".

=item $obj-E<gt>B<uniqueId>()

Returns the value of the unique key associated with the document C<id>.  Only
the server knowns which field is the unique one.  If it differs from the
usual C<id>, you have to set it via global value C<$Apache::Solr::uniqueKey>
