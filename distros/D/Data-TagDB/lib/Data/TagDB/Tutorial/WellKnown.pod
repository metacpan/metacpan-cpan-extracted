=head1 NAME

Data::TagDB::Tutorial::WellKnown - Work with Tag databases

=head1 VERSION

version v0.08

=head1 Overview

This documentation lists a set of well known tags that are commonly found in databases.
It is by no mean an exhaustive list.

Tags listed here are included in L<Data::TagDB::WellKnown> unless marked otherwise.

B<Note:> This document however uses the standard spelling using C<->. To access the tag via L<Data::TagDB::WellKnown>
one must convert all C<-> to C<_>. For example:

    my Data::TagDB::Tag $tag = $wk->also_shares_identifier; # also-shares-identifier

See L<Data::TagDB::WellKnown> for details.

=head1 Tags

=head2 also-has-comment

UUID: 11d8962c-0a71-4d00-95ed-fa69182788a8

This tag is used as a relation denoting a comment on the tag or it's subject.
This can be used in any link (relation or metadata).
It should be used with I<context> set to a valid context (such as the application context, a user/account, or an instance).

Other relations might L<specialise|/specialises> on this.

L</also-has-title>.

=head2 also-has-description

UUID: 30710bdb-6418-42fb-96db-2278f3bfa17f

This tag is used as a relation denoting a description for the tag or it's subject.
This can be used in any link (relation or metadata).
It should be used with I<context> set to a valid context (such as the application context, instance, or language).

Other relations might L<specialise|/specialises> on this.

=head2 also-has-role

UUID: d2750351-aed7-4ade-aa80-c32436cc6030

This tag is used as a relation to denote a role (type) the tag has.
This is an inclusive relation, meaning the tag may also have any number of other
(more specific or more generic) roles.

See also L</has-type>.

=for comment also-has-subtitle           => 'df70343f-0c5f-4d76-93b6-4376f680f567',

=head2 also-has-title

UUID: f7fd59e6-6727-4128-a0a7-cbc702dc09b8

This tag defines a relation that provides the title of subject of the current tag.
This relation can be used in any link (relation or metadata).
It should be used with I<context> set to a valid context (such as the application context, instance, or language).

B<Note:>
This is not to be confused with the name of the subject or the subject's job title.
This relation is meant to provide the title of a creative work such as a book.

L</also-has-description>.

=head2 also-list-contains-also

UUID: 4c9656eb-c130-42b7-9348-a1fee3f42050

This tag is used in as a relation on tag lists. It denotes an element in the list.
This tag specifically makes no assumption on how the I<related> tag is included in the list.
(Such as the order, or if it has other qualifiers.)

The tag this tag is used as a relation on has the role of a L</specific-taglist>
(for example a directory or a shopping list).

=for comment also-shares-colour          => 'c6e83600-fd96-4b71-b216-21f0c4d73ca6',

=head2 also-shares-identifier

UUID: ddd60c5c-2934-404f-8f2d-fcb4da88b633

This tag is used as a relation in a metadata to assign an identifier to the tag.
The type of the identifier must be set.

=head2 colour-value

UUID: c64b5209-b975-4e59-9467-3c3b3f136b4e

This tag is used as a type for colour values in metadata.

The default I<encoding> (in case I<encoding> is C<undef>) is L</hex-rgb-encoding>.

=head2 default-context

UUID: 6ba648c2-3657-47c2-8541-9b73c3a9b2b4

This tag is used as a context and can be used in any link.
The meaning of this context is to provide a fallback for more specific contexts without
representing a universally true value.

Examples of this include internationalisation:
names (or any string) may be given in different languages using different contexts.
However if the user is not in any of those language contexts an implementation can fall
back to the value given with the default context.

B<Note:>
Links with I<context> set to C<undef> are B<always> valid. So they should be handled
by software in parallel to other contexts, not as an alternative.

A implementation may use a logic like:

=over

=item *

Take all links with a context matching any context the application and/or the user is part of.

=item *

If the list is empty use all links with the context set to to the I<default-context>.

=item *

Unconditionally add all links with the context set to C<undef>.

=back

=head2 default-encoding

UUID: 8440eabd-5d73-4679-8f06-abaa06cf04ac

This tag is used as a relation on types to denote the default encoding
used when the encoding of a metadata is set to C<undef>.

=head2 default-type

UUID: 87c4892f-ae39-476e-8ed0-d9ed321dafe9

This tag is used as a relation on relations to denote the default type
used when the type of a metadata is set to C<undef>.

=head2 displaycolour

UUID: a7cfbcb0-45e2-46b9-8f60-646ab2c18b0b

This relation is used to denote a colour that is used with the tag to provide a visual aid for the user.
This can for example be used to assign a colour to be displayed alongside a note so it is easier for
the user to spot the right note they are looking for.

This relation should virtually always be used with a I<context> that is non-C<undef>.
Most commonly the I<context> set on the link is the tag of the user (or account) who set the colour.
This links the value to said user.
Another common value for I<context> is L</default-context>. This denotes the displaycolour the
creator/publisher prefers. But it can still be overridden by a user.

The default type (when used in metadata without a I<type> set) is L</colour-value>.

=head2 final-file-encoding

UUID: 448c50a8-c847-4bc7-856e-0db5fea8f23b

This relation is used on (proto-)files to denote the encoding the file will have when reaching
it's final state.
In most cases this will be used with relations with I<related> set to a tag representing a media-subtype.
However this can also point to a more or less specific value.

=head2 final-file-hash

UUID: 79385945-0963-44aa-880a-bca4a42e9002

This relation is used on (proto-)files to denote the hash (digest) the file will have when reaching
it's final state.
When stored as a metadata the default is to store the value in the universal tag format for hashes.

=head2 final-file-size

UUID: 1cd4a6c6-0d7c-48d1-81e7-4e8d41fdb45d

This relation is used on (proto-)files to denote the size the file will have when reaching
it's final state. When stored as a metadata the default is to store the value in bytes.

=head2 hex-rgb-encoding

UUID: 66d561ee-c06f-408f-a56c-a009439283bb

This is an encoding for a colour in RGB colour space.

The value is encoded in hash-and-hex notation or "#RRGGBB".
The length of the value is always exactly 7 characters (also 7 bytes) long.
The value must be in all lower case. But parsers should also support upper case and mixed case.
Parsers must not support named colours or similar.

=head2 inverse-relation

UUID: 1eae4688-f66c-4c77-bc9b-bb38be88240a

This tag is used as a relation set on relations. It denotes a second relation
that is B<exactly> inverse to the relation it is set on.

Formally speaking this means that:
Relations X and Y are inverse if and only if the relations
I<A X B> and I<B Y A> are only both true or neither of them.

B<Example:>
Parent and child are inverse relations because when A is a child of B, B is the parent of A.
And if B is the parent of A, A is always a child of B.
So child and parent are inverse.

Not inverse are parent and son-of: If A is the son-of B, then B is the parent of A.
But because B is the parent of A, A may or may not be the son-of B (it could also be a daughter).
So son-of and parent are not inverse.

B<Note:>
Implementations are free to insert inverse relations at will in order to autocomplete the data.
However the value of I<filter> in a relation is not well defined for inverse relations.
Implementations should therefore skip generating any inverse relation if I<filter> is not C<undef>.
