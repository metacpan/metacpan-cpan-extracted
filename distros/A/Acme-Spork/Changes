0.0.3  Mon Jan  9 20:36:78 2006
	- realized I hadn't put this in the change log after uploading 0.0.2, doh!
        - or updated the version in README
	- added "the" to the POD near plastic for good measure
	- make spork() return (instead of croak) if fork fails so you can handle the failure as need be
	- added child sig so zombies do not happen, we hope anyhoo ;p
        - slowed down to hopefully not miss the stupid stuff

0.0.4  Tue Sep 12 20:38:30 CDT 2006
    - added daemonize_without_close_on()

0.0.8  Wed Apr  1 21:52:29 2009
    - Double fork to avoid needing to munge $SIG{CHLD} outside of spork()
    - pipe() to get spork()ed process's PID back for return
    - $SIG{CHLD} so that $? inside spork() is correct (i.e. not -1 for auto reaped)
    - the 3 things above also make it zombie safe for when the parent outlives the child
    - explicit exit after coderef call to avoid "fork doubling"
    - Ability to define Acme::Spork::setsid() to not use POSIX::setsid() (i.e. to not load POSIX)
