NAME
    MooX::ClassAttribute - declare class attributes Moose-style... but without
    Moose

SYNOPSIS
       {
          package Foo;
          use Moo;
          use MooX::ClassAttribute;
          class_has ua => (
             is      => 'rw',
             default => sub { LWP::UserAgent->new },
          );
       }
   
       my $r = Foo->ua->get("http://www.example.com/");

DESCRIPTION
    This module adds support for class attributes to Moo. Class attributes are
    attributes whose values are not associated with any particular instance of
    the class.

    For example, the `Person` class might have a class attribute
    "binomial_name"; its value "Homo sapiens" is not associated with any
    particular individual, but the class as a whole.

       say Person->binomial_name;   # "Homo sapiens"
       my $bob = Person->new;
       say $bob->binomial_name;     # "Homo sapiens"
   
       my $alice = Person->new;
       $alice->binomial_name("H. sapiens");
       say $bob->binomial_name;     # "H. sapiens"

    Class attributes may be defined in roles, however they cannot be called as
    methods using the role package name. Instead the role must be composed
    with a class; the class attributes will be installed into that class.

    This module mostly tries to behave like MooseX::ClassAttribute.

CAVEATS
    *   Overriding class attributes and their accessors in subclasses is not
        yet supported. The implementation, and expected behaviour hasn't been
        figured out yet.

    *   When Moo classes are inflated to Moose classes, this module will
        *attempt* to load MooseX::ClassAttribute, and use that to provide
        class attribute meta objects.

        If MooseX::ClassAttribute cannot be loaded, a loud warning will be
        printed, and the inflation will fall back to representing class
        attribute accessors as plain old class methods.

    *   This module uses some pretty experimental techniques, especially to
        handle inflation. There are probably all sorts of bugs lurking. Don't
        let that scare you though; I'm usually pretty quick to fix bugs once
        they're reported. ;-)
