 3. News in detail

 - Unicode
    + UTF-8 files will be recognized when opening and also saved as such.
    + The fourth pane of the statusbar shows if current coding is utf or ascii.
    + Coding of empty files can be changed with the Document > Encoding menu,
    it may (yet) not work otherwise.
 
 - New Mouse Controls
    Following settings can all be changed or made disable at once.
    + Left click on the selection does copy it.
    + Middle click inserts selection.
    + Middle click on the selection searches for next instance of that string.
    + In any other case Middle click moves cursor to the position of last edit.
    + Middle click while holding left pastes from clipboard.
    + Right click while holding left does cut and selection to clipboard.

 - Code Folding
    + Between the line numbers and the text area a new margin appeared, that 
    marks with symbols the beginnings of all code chunks that can be folded.
    + Left click or <Ctrl>+<+> folds or defolds (toggles) the current node.
    + Middle click or <Ctrl>+<Shift>+<+> toggles current node with all children.
    + Right click or <Alt>+<+> toggles all nodes of that level. All nodes without
    parent are on level one, its direct children are level two and so forth.
    + Right click while holding left or <Alt>+<Shift>+<+> toggles all nodes.
    + A document, reopened from file history has the folding state as when closed.
 
 - Marker
    Green arrows on the left of the line numbers mark important text spots.
    + They can be toggled with a left click on marker margin or <Ctrl>+<F2>.
    + <F2> or <Shift>+<F2> navigate forth and back between marker of a doc.
    + When adding <Alt>+, Marker in all Docs can be navigated.
    + Same you achieve with the green arrows at the search bar.
    + A submenu with all marker functions is inside the search menu.
    + Also bookmarks can now be toggled with a middle click on the marker margin.
 
 - Richer Interface
    + The main window has 3 new modes, all closed by the <Esc> key.
      + <F11> - fullscreen, win consumes the whole screen and has no more border.
      + <Shift>+<F11> - Max Editpanel, all app bars are toggled.
      + <Alt>+<F11> - toggles transparency of the main win.
      + <Ctrl>+<F11> - no other win can stay on top of Kephra.
    + Tabbar (<Ctrl>+<Alt>+<T>) and menu bar (<Ctrl>+<Alt>+<M>) can be toggled.
    + Tabs in Tabbar are now also movable with mouse.
    + The rightmost symbol of the tabbar opens a menu to select the current doc.
    + In the left margin can now be opened a new context menu.
    + The status bar can now be defined by a YAML file as other toolbars too.
    Open that file with the menu item Config > User Interface > Toolbar.
    + Is a opened file deleted elsewhere, a new dialog tells you that and offers
    several options to deal with that.
    + Several icons are redesigned by Jens Neuwerk.

 - More Tools
    + <Shift>+<F4> copies selection into the notepad.
    + A new dialog displays selected color values and writes the selected color
    in HTML hex format into the document.

    + Output panel can show selection, converted into decimal or hexadecimal numbers.
    + Is caret inside a quoted string, copy that with <Alt>+<Shift>+<C>.
    + <Ctrl>+<Shift>+<V> inserts the Perl varibale last used in this block.
    + inserting current time and date
    + NonASCII character can be converted to HTML-Entities and back.

 - More Help

    + A new item in the help menu opens the online documentation in the browser. 
    + The next item opens a help forum for Perl programmer.
    + And next 2 items open our online ticket system to report wishes or errors.
