X11/WM/Sawfish version 0.03
===========================

This module implements the two methods for remotely evaluating LISP forms in
the Sawfish window manager for X11.  X11::WM::Sawfish::UNIX implements the UNIX
domain sockets method, and X11::WM::Sawfish::XProp implements the X server
window properties method.  Both are derived from X11::WM::Sawfish, and the 'new'
method of the base class creates one of the two derived classes depending on
which can connect to the server.  The UNIX domain socket method is attempted
first, with the X properties method as the fallback.
