Revision history for Perl extension MP3::CreateInlayCard.

0.05  2009/02/11
    - Oops, last release still had the problem of declaring MP3::Tag as a
      requisite, but not MP3::Info, which MP3::Tag requires to actually do
      anything.  Converted to use Music::Tag, a step in the right direction
      towards supporting various file types.
      Also, generate META.yml via the Makefile.PL instead of by hand.

0.04  2009/02/09
    - Use File::Find::Rule instead of File::Recurse (I've given up trying to
      get co-maintainership of F::R to release a fixed version, and the old
      version is no longer available from CPAN).

0.03  2008/03/08
    - minor Kwalitee-boosting tweaks
    - add option to "prettify" artist/track names
    - add example usage script
    
0.02  2008/01/14
    - minor changes to boost Kwalitee score, add POD tests, and work on 5.8.0
    
0.01  2007/02/10
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.23 with options
		-AXc -n MP3::CreateInlayCard
