NAME

    MojoX::UserAgent::Throttler - add throttling support to Mojo::UserAgent

VERSION

    This document describes MojoX::UserAgent::Throttler version v1.0.3

SYNOPSIS

        use MojoX::UserAgent::Throttler;
        use Sub::Throttler::SOME_ALGORITHM;
    
        my $throttle = Sub::Throttler::SOME_ALGORITHM->new(...);
        $throttle->apply_to_methods('Mojo::UserAgent');

DESCRIPTION

    This module helps throttle Mojo::UserAgent using Sub::Throttler.

    While in most cases this module isn't needed and existing functionality
    of Sub::Throttler is enough to throttle Mojo::UserAgent, there are two
    special cases which needs extra handling - when Mojo::UserAgent object
    is destroyed while there are delayed requests, and when new async
    requests start while destroying Mojo::UserAgent object.

    To handle these cases it won't be enough to just do usual:

        throttle_it('Mojo::UserAgent::start');

    Instead you'll have to write "custom wrapper" in Sub::Throttler plus
    add wrapper for Mojo::UserAgent::DESTROY. Both are provided by this
    module and activated when you load it.

    So, when using this module you shouldn't manually call throttle_it()
    like shown above - just use this module and then setup throttling
    algorithms as you need and apply them to "start" in Mojo::UserAgent -
    this will let you throttle all (sync/async, GET/POST/etc.) requests.
    Use "apply_to" in Sub::Throttler::algo to customize throttling based on
    request method, hostname, etc.

 EXAMPLE

        use MojoX::UserAgent::Throttler;
        use Sub::Throttler::Limit;
        my $throttle = Sub::Throttler::Limit->new(limit=>5);
        # Example policy:
        # - don't throttle sync calls
        # - throttle async GET requests by host
        # - throttle other async requests by method, per $ua object
        # I.e. allow up to 5 parallel GET requests to each host globally for
        # all Mojo::UserAgent objects plus up to 5 parallel non-GET requests
        # per each Mojo::UserAgent object.
        $throttle->apply_to(sub {
            my ($this, $name, @params) = @_;
            if (ref $this eq 'Mojo::UserAgent') {
                my ($tx, $cb) = @params;
                if (!$cb) {
                    return;
                } elsif ('GET' eq uc $tx->req->method) {
                    return { $tx->req->url->host => 1 };
                } else {
                    return { "$this " . uc $tx->req->method => 1 };
                }
            }
            return;
        });
