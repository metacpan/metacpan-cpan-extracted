DESCRIPTION
    This module is the static (offline) version of Finance::SE::IDX. It
    provides the same functions and arguments, but the data is cached in the
    source code. It is useful as a fallback when the source that
    Finance::SE::IDX uses is unavailable. As a consequence, the data will be
    somewhat out of date.

FUNCTIONS
  list_idx_boards
  list_idx_firms
  list_idx_sectors
