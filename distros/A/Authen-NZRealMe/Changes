Revision history for Authen-NZRealMe

1.20      2020-02-25 13:07:33+13:00 Pacific/Auckland
    - implement HTTP-POST binding through new resolve_posted_assertion()
      method in ServiceProvider.pm
    - as RealMe's HTTP-POST assertions are all encrypted, support has been
      added for XML encryption; and the new 'CryptX' dependency is added for
      the required AES128-CBC cipher
    - revised SP metadata generation and editing to support multiple ACS
      entries with support for HTTP-POST vs HTTP-Artifact bindings
    - allow initial request to specify the index of the ACS to which the
      response should be sent
    - removed support for "force_auth" parameter to new_request
    - fix missing namespace when generating SP metadata file
    - add some asserts to sanity check user input

1.19      2019-02-20 19:11:05+13:00 Pacific/Auckland
    - further improvements around the use of find_verified_element()
    - fix handling of skip_signature_check option

1.18      2019-02-19 12:22:20+13:00 Pacific/Auckland
    - use find_verified_element() when preparing the ResolutionResponse
    - fix namespace URI in tests data (URI for wst: has spurious trailing '/')
    - improve test coverage with less mocking

1.17      2019-02-18 15:14:53+13:00 Pacific/Auckland
    - Add support for RSA-SHA256 signatures (both signing and verification)
      in advance of new signatures to be provided by RealMe
    - Refactor XMLSig module to be more modular and use a single implementation
      of signing and of verification for both single-reference and multi-
      reference signatures.
    - When generating an XML signature the name of the ID attribute used for
      Reference URIs is now usually left unspecified. The relevant target
      elements are now located using just the supplied attribute value.
    - The XMLSig verify() method now accepts an XPath selector argument to
      specify which signature block to verify (was hard-coded).
    - After verifying a signature, the caller should now use the new
      find_verified_element() method to ensure subsequent XPath queries only
      target verified sections of the original signed document.
    - Reduce code duplication by adding CommonURIs as the single place where
      namespace and token URIs are defined.

1.16      2016-05-01 11:51:32 Pacific/Auckland
