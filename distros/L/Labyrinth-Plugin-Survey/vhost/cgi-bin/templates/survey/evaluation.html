<h3>Dear Attendee,</h3>
<p>We would like to invite you to complete the following [% section %] assessment form
as best you can. Our aim is to to help the [% section %] presenter to improve their 
presentation for future attendees.</p>
<p>Please note that your individual assessment response will be stored anonymously.
[% IF section == 'course' %]
Your conference survey code is only used to ensure multiple forms are not
submitted, and is referenced independently of your submitted assessment response,
so we cannot correlate the two.
[% ELSE %]
As we do not record what talks you attended, we are relying on your good nature to
only respond to talks to which you did indeed attend :)
[% END %]
</p>
<p>Please complete this assessment form as soon as possible, as the 
submissions will close at <b>midnight on [% survey_close %]</b>.</p>
<p>Many thanks for taking part.</p>
