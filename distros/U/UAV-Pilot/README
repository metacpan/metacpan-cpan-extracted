Perl library for controlling UAVs, specifically ARDrone (maybe others in the future).  See:

http://ardrone2.parrot.com

WARNING!
If your ARDrone crashes into your neighbor's house, invades Iranian airspace, or tries to 
find Sarah Conner, don't blame me.


RECOMMENDED MODULES
===================

SDL is highly recommended on clients for displaying navigation data, video 
streams, and joystick input.

The RaspberryPi HiPi modules are only needed for the WumpusRover server.


INSTALLATION
============

For full functionality, you will need the SDL Perl module and the ffmpeg C library.

Install with the standard Module::Build method:

    perl ./Build.PL
    ./Build
    ./Build test
    ./Build install
