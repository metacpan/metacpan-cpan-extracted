DESCRIPTION

  IPC::MMA allows data to be shared among related Unix/Linux processes
  in a straightforward way.  It provides methods to create and
  destroy shared memory segments and to create, access, and maintain
  data structures within segments.  Perl scalars, arrays, and hashes
  can be stored in shared memory.  There are six possible kinds of
  arrays: general-purpose scalars, signed or unsigned integers,
  floating-point numbers, fixed-length strings/records, and single-bit
  booleans.

PREREQUISITE

  This module requires Ralf Engelschall's mm library.  It was developed
  with version 1.4.2.  See http://www.ossp.org/pkg/lib/mm/ for more
  about mm.

  Experienced users may prefer to install mm from a different source:

  debian/ubuntu: $ sudo apt-get install libmm-dev
  FreeBSD ports: $ cd ports/devel/mm        # (wherever ports lives)
                 $ sudo make
                 $ sudo make install

INSTALLATION

  Your computer needs to have the mm library before you can use
  IPC::MMA.  Many Unix/Linux systems include this library.  If you
  need to download and install mm, see the preceding section.

  The easy way to install IPC::MMA:

    $ perl -MCPAN -e "install IPC::MMA"

  The classic way:

    Choose a directory to use for installing.
    Move/download the distribution file IPC-MMA-n.nn.tar.gz into it
    cd into it
    $ tar -xf IPC-MMA-n.nn.tar.gz

    This will produce a new directory IPC-MMA-n.nn.

    $ cd IPC-MMA-n.nn
    $ perl Makefile.PL
    $ make
    $ make test

    Assuming those steps don't show any problems:

    $ sudo make install  (or just make install if you're superuser)

  Either of the above alternatives should install IPC::MMA into the
  Perl library.

  See the POD documentation for further details. Once the module
  is installed, you should be able to read the documentation by
  typing the following from the command-line:

    $ perldoc IPC::MMA

  Or if your man system is configured in a compatible way:

    $ man IPC::MMA


NOTES
    This module requires perl 5.6 or later.

    The initial use of the array functions of this module was to track
    related-file accesses on our Apache web server, and thus optimize
    use of the HTTP keep-alive feature.   Watch CPAN for this module
    in the future (its working name is Apache2::CloseKeepAlive).
