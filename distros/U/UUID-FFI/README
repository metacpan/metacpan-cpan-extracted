NAME

    UUID::FFI - Universally Unique Identifiers FFI style

VERSION

    version 0.05

SYNOPSIS

     my $uuid = UUID::FFI->new_random;
     print $uuid->as_hex, "\n";

DESCRIPTION

    This module provides an FFI interface to libuuid. libuuid library is
    used to generate unique identifiers for objects that may be accessible
    beyond the local system

CONSTRUCTORS

 new

     my $uuid = UUID::FFI->new($hex);

    Create a new UUID object from the hex representation $hex.

 new_random

     my $uuid = UUID::FFI->new_random;

    Create a new UUID object with a randomly generated value.

 new_time

     my $uuid = UUID::FFI->new_time;

    Create a new UUID object generated using the time and mac address. This
    can leak information about when and where the UUID was generated.

 new_null

     my $uuid = UUID::FFI->new_null;

    Create a new UUID NULL UUID object (all zeros).

METHODS

 is_null

     my $bool = $uuid->is_null;

    Returns true if the UUID is NULL UUID.

 clone

     my $uuid2 = $uuid->clone;

    Create a new UUID object with the identical value to the original.

 as_hex

     my $hex = $uuid->as_hex;
     my $hex = "$uuid";

    Returns the hex representation of the UUID. The stringification of
    UUID::FFI uses this function, so you can also use it in a double quoted
    string.

 compare

     my $cmp = $uuid1->compare($uuid2);
     my $cmp = $uuid1 <=> $uuid2;
     my @sorted_uuids = sort { $a->compare($b) } @uuids;
     my @sorted_uuids = sort { $a <=> $b } @uuids;

    Returns an integer less than, equal to or greater than zero if $uuid1
    is found, respectively, to be lexicographically less than, equal, or
    greater that $uuid2. The <=> is also overloaded so you can use that
    too.

 type

     my $type = $uuid->type;

    Returns the type of UUID, either time or random, if it can be
    identified.

 variant

     my $variant = $uuid->variant

    Returns the variant of the UUID, either ncs, dce, microsoft or other.

 time

     my $time = $uuid->time;

    Returns the time the UUID was generated. The value returned is in
    seconds since the UNIX epoch, so is compatible with perl builtins like
    time and localtime.
