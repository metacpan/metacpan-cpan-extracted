# NAME

Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::TestingMania - test your dist with every testing plugin conceivable

# VERSION

version 0.25

# SYNOPSIS

In `dist.ini`:

    [@TestingMania]

# DESCRIPTION

This plugin bundle collects all the testing plugins for [Dist::Zilla](https://metacpan.org/pod/Dist::Zilla) which
exist (and are not deprecated). This is for the most paranoid people who
want to test their dist seven ways to Sunday.

Simply add the following near the end of `dist.ini`:

    [@TestingMania]

## Testing plugins

- [Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Test::Compile](https://metacpan.org/pod/Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Test::Compile), which performs tests to syntax check your
dist.
- [Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Test::Perl::Critic](https://metacpan.org/pod/Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Test::Perl::Critic), which checks your code against best
practices. See [Test::Perl::Critic](https://metacpan.org/pod/Test::Perl::Critic) and [Perl::Critic](https://metacpan.org/pod/Perl::Critic) for details.

    You can set a perlcritic config file:

        [@TestingMania]
        critic_config = perlcriticrc

- [Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Test::DistManifest](https://metacpan.org/pod/Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Test::DistManifest), which tests `MANIFEST` for
correctness. See [Test::DistManifest](https://metacpan.org/pod/Test::DistManifest) for details.
- [Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Test::EOL](https://metacpan.org/pod/Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Test::EOL), which ensures the correct line endings are
used (and also checks for trailing whitespace). See [Test::EOL](https://metacpan.org/pod/Test::EOL) for details.
- [Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Test::Version](https://metacpan.org/pod/Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Test::Version), which tests that your dist has
version numbers, and that they are valid. See [Test::Version](https://metacpan.org/pod/Test::Version) for exactly
what that means.

    You can set `strict_version` and `has_version`, and they'll be passed through to
    the plugin as `is_strict` and `has_version` respectively. See the
    documentation of [Test::Version](https://metacpan.org/pod/Test::Version) for a description of these options.

- [Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Test::Kwalitee](https://metacpan.org/pod/Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Test::Kwalitee), which performs some basic kwalitee checks.
_Kwalitee_ is an automatically-measurable guage of how good your software is.
It bears only a **superficial** resemblance to the human-measurable guage of
actual quality. See [Test::Kwalitee](https://metacpan.org/pod/Test::Kwalitee) for a description of the tests.
- [Dist::Zilla::Plugin::MetaTests](https://metacpan.org/pod/Dist::Zilla::Plugin::MetaTests), which performs some extra tests on
`META.yml`. See [Test::CPAN::Meta](https://metacpan.org/pod/Test::CPAN::Meta) for what that means.
- [Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Test::CPAN::Meta::JSON](https://metacpan.org/pod/Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Test::CPAN::Meta::JSON), which performs some extra tests
on `META.json`, if it exists. See [Test::CPAN::Meta::JSON](https://metacpan.org/pod/Test::CPAN::Meta::JSON) for what that
means.
- [Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Test::MinimumVersion](https://metacpan.org/pod/Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Test::MinimumVersion), which tests for the minimum
required version of perl. Give the highest version of perl you intend to
require as `max_target_perl`. The generated test will fail if you accidentally
used features from a version of perl newer than that. See
[Test::MinimumVersion](https://metacpan.org/pod/Test::MinimumVersion) for details and limitations.
- [Dist::Zilla::Plugin::MojibakeTests](https://metacpan.org/pod/Dist::Zilla::Plugin::MojibakeTests), which tests for the correct
source/documentation character encoding.
- [Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Test::NoTabs](https://metacpan.org/pod/Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Test::NoTabs), which ensures you don't use _The Evil
Character_. See [Test::NoTabs](https://metacpan.org/pod/Test::NoTabs) for details. If you wish to exclude this plugin,
see ["Disabling Tests"](#disabling-tests).
- [Dist::Zilla::Plugin::PodCoverageTests](https://metacpan.org/pod/Dist::Zilla::Plugin::PodCoverageTests), which checks that you have Pod
documentation for the things you should have it for. See [Test::Pod::Coverage](https://metacpan.org/pod/Test::Pod::Coverage)
for what that means.
- [Dist::Zilla::Plugin::PodSyntaxTests](https://metacpan.org/pod/Dist::Zilla::Plugin::PodSyntaxTests), which checks that your Pod is
well-formed. See [Test::Pod](https://metacpan.org/pod/Test::Pod) and [perlpod](https://metacpan.org/pod/perlpod) for details.
- [Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Test::Portability](https://metacpan.org/pod/Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Test::Portability), which performs some basic tests to
ensure portability of file names. See [Test::Portability::Files](https://metacpan.org/pod/Test::Portability::Files) for what
that means.
- [Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Test::Synopsis](https://metacpan.org/pod/Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Test::Synopsis), which does syntax checking on the code
from your SYNOPSIS section. See [Test::Synopsis](https://metacpan.org/pod/Test::Synopsis) for details and limitations.
- [Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Test::UnusedVars](https://metacpan.org/pod/Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Test::UnusedVars), which checks your dist for unused
variables. See [Test::Vars](https://metacpan.org/pod/Test::Vars) for details.
- [Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Test::Pod::LinkCheck](https://metacpan.org/pod/Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Test::Pod::LinkCheck), which checks the links in your POD.
See [Test::Pod::LinkCheck](https://metacpan.org/pod/Test::Pod::LinkCheck) for details.
- [Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Test::CPAN::Changes](https://metacpan.org/pod/Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Test::CPAN::Changes), which checks your changelog for
conformance with [CPAN::Changes::Spec](https://metacpan.org/pod/CPAN::Changes::Spec). See [Test::CPAN::Changes](https://metacpan.org/pod/Test::CPAN::Changes) for details.

    Set `changelog` in `dist.ini` if you don't use `Changes`:

        [@TestingMania]
        changelog = CHANGELOG

## Disabling Tests

To exclude a testing plugin, specify them with `disable` in `dist.ini`

    [@TestingMania]
    disable = Test::DistManifest
    disable = Test::Kwalitee

## Enabling Tests

This pluginbundle may have some testing plugins that aren't
enabled by default. This option allows you to turn them on. Attempting to add
plugins which are not listed above will have _no effect_.

To enable a testing plugin, specify them in `dist.ini`:

    [@TestingMania]
    enable = Test::Compile
