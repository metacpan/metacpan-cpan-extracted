NAME
    File::KeePass::Agent - Application agent for working with File::KeePass
    objects

SYNOPSIS
       use File::KeePass::Agent;
       File::KeePass::Agent->new->run($file, $pass);


       File::KeePass::Agent->new->run;  # will read from @ARGV or prompt


       File::KeePass::Agent::run();  # will read from @ARGV or prompt


       File::KeePass::Agent::run(\%files);  # file/pass pairs


       File::KeePass::Agent::run(\@files);

       File::KeePass::Agent::run(\@files, \@passes);  # parallel arrays

    You may pass the name of the keepass filename that you would like to
    open. Otherwise you are prompted for the file to open.

    You are then prompted for the password and/or the keyfile that will be
    used to open the file.

    See File::KeePass for a listing of what KeyPass database features are
    currently handled.

OS
    File::KeePass::Agent (FKPA) will try to load a module based on the OS
    returned by the $^O variable. OS support during the initial releases is
    very sparse.

FKPA OS API
    The unix module variant contains documentation about what methods are
    necessary to support the FKPA api.

    See "FKPA METHODS" in File::KeePass::Agent::unix.

METHODS
    "new"
        Returns an object blessed into the FKPA class.

    "run"
        Reads the file, password, prints out a summary of the database, and
        binds any shortcut keys. Eventually, this will most likely support
        more maintenance features.

    "keepass"
        Returns an arrayref of arrayrefs continaing file and File::KeePass
        object pairs.

    "shortcut_name"
        Returns a human readable name from a shortcut hashref.

    "active_entries"
        Finds current active entries from any of the open databases.

    "active_searches"
        Parses the active searches and returns a listing of qr
        matches/auto-type string/entry records.

    "search_auto_type"
        Takes an window title and compares it against the current active
        searches.

    "do_no_match"
        Called if search_auto_type didn't find a matching window.

    "do_auto_type"
        Called if search_auto_type found a single match.

    "do_auto_type_mult"
        Called if search_auto_type found multiple matching windows.

    "do_auto_type_unsupported"
        Called when FKPA doesn't support an auto-type directive.

GLOBAL SHORTCUTS
    FKPA will read for the current global shortcut listed in the keepassx
    configuration file. At the moment this must first be configured using
    keepassx itself. Future support will allow for configuring this through
    FKPA itself.

    If this global shortcut is defined, when pressed it will call
    search_auto_type to find entries matching against the current window
    title. If found, it will auto-type the matching entry.

    Additionally, custom global shortcuts may defined in the comments
    section of the FKP database entries. They have the form:

       Custom-Global-Shortcut: Ctrl-Alt-Shift w

    This allows for individual entry auto-typing to be called directly.

AUTOTYPE SUPPORT
    Version 2 databases natively support auto-type entries. Comment sections
    of version 1 database entries may contain Auto-type entries in the
    following form:

        Auto-Type-Window: Admin Login*
        Auto-Type-Window: Login*
        Auto-Type: {USERNAME}{TAB}{PASSWORD}{ENTER}

    The Auto-Type-Window items are used to match against window titles. You
    may put a leading * and/or a trailing * on the item to allow for
    wildcard matching.

    If a window matches an Auto-Type-Window entry the corresponding
    Auto-Type item will be processed and "auto-typed" to the current window.

    Currently the following auto-type directives are supported:

    "USERNAME"
        The username for the entry.

    "PASSWORD"
        The password for the entry.

    "URL"
        The URL for the entry.

    "..."
        All properties of the entry may be accessed.

    "TAB"
        The tab character.

    "ENTER"
        The enter character.

STATUS
    This module and program are proof of concept. They work, but are limited
    in their feature set. There currently are no managment capabilities.
