0.114   12.02.17
        * GH #3: Improved docs. (Shlomi Fish)
        * GH #2: Switch back to the more-maintained namespace::autoclean.
          (Karen Etheridge)
        * GH #5: Do not ship with Build.PL.

0.113   14.10.16
        * Provide a META.json file.
        * Removed some duplication in resources in metadata.

0.112   30.12.12
        * Use namespace::sweep instead of namespace::autoclean. The latter
          brings up Class::MOP, which is clearly unnecessary here.
        * Fix some override in tests to help out perl 5.8.8.

0.111   29.12.12
        * 100% testing coverage.

0.110   05.12.12
        * Now it's possible to send a logger *and* to override a value.
          The value will be overridden in the logger.

0.101   05.12.12
        * Log deprecation warning as well.

0.100   04.12.12
        * Setting logger_ident to object name instead of role name.
        * Deprecating log_fields (just pass "logger" attribute instead).
          It will be removed in the next version. Probably.
        * Documentation improvements.

0.010   04.11.12
        * No functional changes.
        * Document a hard-to-debug situation.
          (not a bug of MooseX::Role::Loggable)

0.009   24.08.12
        * GH #1: Allow Log::Dispatchouli::Proxy as well.
          (thanks, Peter Shangov)

0.008   22.07.12
        * Move to Moo instead of Any::Moose.
        * Require Sys::Syslog 0.25.

0.007   03.01.12
        * Finally remove prereq of Moose!

0.006   03.01.12
        * Adding Sys::Syslog 0.16 as a prereq.

0.005   29.12.11
        * Add log_fields method to allow to easily propagate preferences
          to other objects.
        * Change tests to use Any::Moose.

0.004   27.07.11
        * Use Any::Moose instead of Moose directly.
        (this makes it possible to use with Moose or Mouse)

0.003   25.04.11
        * Adding log_file, log_path, log_pid, log_fail_fatal, log_muted
          and log_quiet_fatal.
        * Added set_debug and clear_debug.
        * Added clear_prefix, set_muted, clear_muted.
        * The method debug() no longer carries a trigger and the boolean
          is instead propagated to the Log::Dispatchouli object.

0.002   22.03.11
        * Add a synopsis.

0.001   21.03.11
        * It's out!
