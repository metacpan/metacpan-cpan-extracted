  Lingua::TreeTagger::Installer
 -------------------------------

 This small module (erm, installation script) downloads TreeTagger [1],
 TreeTagger perl scripts and TreeTagger language parameters,
 installing them on your system.

 Please note that the COPYRIGHT statement of this installation tool is
 NOT the same as TreeTagger license. Please read TreeTagger liecense[2].

 Note that the files under extrafiles are copyrighted accordingly with
 TreeTagger license. They should not be distributed in this manner,
 but I will keep them here while the original TreeTagger packages do
 not include them.


 I would like to thank you Micheal Schwern for all his help converting
 ExtUtils::MakeMaker initial script to Module::Build.
