Revision history for Perl extension Data::Undump.

0.15 Wed Aug 28 2013
    - Add support for perl-style comments in the input

0.14 Sun Aug 12 2012
    - Really fix up issues parsing large numbers
      (apparently I modified the .c file and not the
       .xs file, which was then not committed or included
       in the 0.13 dist - which I knew would be broken
       somehow.)

0.13 Sun Aug 12 2012
    - Make it illegal to try to undump duplicate keys
    - fix up issues parsing large numbers

0.12 Sun Aug 12 2012
    - Performance improvements. Handle scalar refs.

0.11 Thu Aug  9 2012
    - v0.10 seems to have lost the octal fix from 0.09

0.10 Thu Aug  9 2012
    - Rebase of v0.09. Sigh

0.09 Thu Aug  9 2012
    - Fix octal and speedup strings.

0.08 Mon Jul 30 2012
    - Fixup 0.07 and 0.06 by adding missing test file.
      for some reason this test does not fail on all perls.
      But it does fail on some.

0.07 Mon Jul 30 2012
    - Silence a warning in 0.06

0.06 Mon Jul 30 2012

0.02 Fri May 18 15:41:56 2012 +0200
    - Do not require 5.8.8 (and changes to make it pass tests)

0.03 Sun May 20 21:40
    - Various test improvements - add a large corpus of test dumps
    - Rework how internal state is stored and passed around so that
      it is easier to break out functionality into subs, and add or
      modify what needs to be passed up and down the stack.

0.01  Wed May 16 00:05:34 2012
