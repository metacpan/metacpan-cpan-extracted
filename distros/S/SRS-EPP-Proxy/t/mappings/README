These files are run by both t/mappings.t and t/integration.t. The former is a
unit test, and applies all assertions, the latter is a full integration test,
requires a properly configured EPP proxy talking to a properly configured
SRS, and only applies the output assertions.

For the integration tests, certain data is assumed to be setup already.
Also, the SRS is assumed to be handling the .te cctld.  The data to be
setup (if any) is in a sub directory called 'create', in a format handled
by RegistrarTests (not part of this distribution!). There is also an
optional 'cleanup' dir, which contains any SRS requests that should be
fired after the test is run.
