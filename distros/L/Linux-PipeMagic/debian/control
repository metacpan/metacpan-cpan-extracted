Description: Perl extension to use the zero copy IO syscalls
 Linux::PipeMagic is a Perl XS wrapper around the splice(2) and tee(2)
 syscalls. You can use them to efficiently data from one file descriptor to
 another inside the kernel (splice), or to efficiently copy data from one pipe
 to another (tee).
