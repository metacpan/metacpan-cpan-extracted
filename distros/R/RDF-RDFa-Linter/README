NAME
    RDF::RDFa::Linter - find common mistakes in RDFa files

SYNOPSIS
     my $parser = RDF::RDFa::Parser->new_from_url($input_url);
     my $linter = RDF::RDFa::Linter->new('Facebook', $input_url, $parser);
     my $model  = $linter->filtered_graph;
     my @errors = $linter->find_errors;

DESCRIPTION
    In the above example, $model is an RDF::Trine::Model containing just the
    statements from $input_url that the service (in this case, Facebook's
    Open Graph) understands.

    @errors is a list of RDF::RDFa::Linter::Error objects.
    RDF::RDFa::Linter::Error is a subclass of
    RDF::RDFa::Generator::HTML::Pretty::Note, which comes in handy if you
    want to generate a report of the errors and filtered graph together.

    TODO: proper documentation!!
