=head1 NAME

Object::Signature::Portable - generate portable fingerprints of objects

=begin readme

=head1 REQUIREMENTS

This module requires Perl v5.10 or newer, and the following non-core
modules:

=over

=item L<Crypt::Digest>

=item L<Exporter::Lite>

=item L<JSON::MaybeXS>

=back

=end readme

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Object::Signature::Portable;

    my $sig = signature( $object ); # MD5 hex of object signature

    my $sig = signature(
      digest => 'SHA1',             # SHA-1 digest
      format => 'b64udigest',       # as URL-safe base-64
      data   => $object,
    );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides a simple function for generating I<portable>
digital fingerprints (a.k.a. signatures, not to be confiused with
public key signatures.) of Perl data structures.

The object is serialized into a canonical JSON structure, and then
hashed using the MD5 algorithm.

Any two machines running different versions of Perl on different
architectures should produce identical signatures.

Note that this module is useful in cases where the consistency of
signatures between machine is more important than the speed of
signature generation.

However, the serialization method, hash algorithm and signature format
can be customized, as needed.

=head1 EXPORTS

=head2 C<signature>

  my $sig = signature( $data );

  my $sig = signature(
    data       => $data,
    digest     => 'MD5',         # default
    format     => 'hexdigest',   # default
    serializer => sub { ... },
  );

Generate a digital fingerprint of the C<$data>.

The following options are supported:

=over 4

=item C<digest>

The cryptographic digest algorithm, as supported by L<Crypt::Digest>.

=item C<format>

The L<Crypt::Digest> formatting method for the signature, which can be
one of:

=over 4

=item C<digest>

The raw bytes of the digest.

=item C<hexdigest>

The digest as a string of hexidecimal numbers.

=item C<b64digest>

The digest as a MIME base-64 string.

=item C<b64udigest>

The digest as a URL-friendly base-64 string.

=back

=item C<prefix>

If set to a true value, the digest is prefixed by the name of the
digest algorithm.

This is useful when you may want to change the digest algorithm used
by an application in the future, but do not want to regenerate
signatures for existing objects in a data store.

=item C<serializer>

The serialization method, which is a subroutine that takes the data as
a single argument, and returns the serialized data to be hashed.

It is recommended that you use a serializer that produces canonical
(normalized) output, and preferably one that produces consistent
output across all of the platforms that you are using.  (L<YAML>,
L<Data::Dumper> or L<Sereal::Encoder> should be acceptable
alternatives, provided that you enable canonical encoding, and in the
case of Sereal, explicitly specify a protocol version.)

By default, it uses L<JSON::MaybeXS>. The choice for using JSON is
based on the following considerations:

=over

=item JSON is a simple, text-based format. The output is not likely to
change between module versions.

=item Classes can be extended with hooks for JSON serialization.

=item Speed is not a factor.

=back

However, see L</LIMITATIONS> below.

=cut

sub signature {
    my %args;

    if ( scalar(@_) <= 1 ) {
        $args{data} = $_[0];
    } else {
        %args = @_;
    }

    $args{digest} //= 'MD5';

    $args{format} //= 'hexdigest';
    unless ( $args{format} =~ m/^(?:hex|b64u?)digest$/ ) {
        croak sprintf( 'Invalid digest format: %s', $args{format} );
    }

    $args{serializer} //= sub {
        return JSON->new->canonical(1)->allow_nonref(1)->utf8(1)->pretty(0)
            ->indent(0)->space_before(0)->space_after(0)->allow_blessed(1)
            ->convert_blessed(1)->encode( $_[0] );
    };

    my $digest = Crypt::Digest->new( $args{digest} );
    $digest->add( &{ $args{serializer} }( $args{data} ) );

    if ( my $method = $digest->can( $args{format} ) ) {
        my $prefix = $args{prefix} ? ( $args{digest} . ':' ) : '';
        return $prefix . $digest->$method;
    } else {
        croak sprintf( 'Unexpected error with digest format: %s',
            $args{format} );
    }
}

=head1 LIMITATIONS

=head2 Signatures for Arbitrary Objects

By default, this module uses L<JSON::MaybeXS> to serialize Perl objects.

This requires the objects to have a C<TO_JSON> method in order to be
serialized.  Unfortunately, this is not suitable for many objects
(particularly those generated by modules that are not under your
control, e.g. many CPAN modules) without monkey-patching or
subclassesing them.

One solution is to use a different serializer that can handle the
object.

Alternatively, you can write a wrapper function that uses a module
such as L<Object::Serializer> to translate an object into a hash
reference that can then be passed to the C<signature> function, e.g.

    package Foo;

    use parent 'Object::Serializer';

    use Object::Signature::Portable ();

    sub signature {
        my $self = shift;
        return Object::Signature::Portable::signature(
          data => $self->serialize
        );
    }

Note that L<Object::Serializer> allows you to define custom
serialization strategies for various reference types.

=head2 Portability

The portability of signatures across different versions of
L<JSON::MaybeXS> is, of course, dependent upon whether those versions
will produce consistent output.

If you are concerned about this, then write our own serializer, or
avoid upgrading L<JSON::MaybeXS> until you are sure that the it will
produce consistent signatures.

=head2 Security

This module is intended for generating signatures of Perl data
structures, as a simple means of determining whether two structures
are different.

For that purpose, the MD5 algorithm is probably good enough.  However,
if you are hashing that in part comes from untrusted sources, or the
consequences of two different data structures having the same
signature are significant, then you should consider using a different
algorithm.

This module is I<not> intended for hashing passwords.

=over

=item L<Object::Signature>

This uses L<Storable> to serialise objects and generate a MD5
hexidecimal string as a signature.

This has the drawback that machines with different architectures,
different versions of Perl, or different versions L<Storable> may not
produce the same signature for the same data. (This does not mean that
L<Storable> is unable to de-serialize data produced by different
versions; it only means that the serialized data is not identical
across different versions.)

=for readme stop

L<Object::Signature> does not allow for customizing the hash algorithm
or signature format.

L<Object::Signature::Portable> module can replicate the signatures
generated by L<Object::Signature>, using the following:

  use Storable 2.11;

  my $sig = signature(
    data       => $data,
    serializer => sub {
      local $Storable::canonical = 1;
      return Storable::nfreeze($_[0]);
    },
  );

As noted above, using L<Storable> will not produce portable
signatures.
