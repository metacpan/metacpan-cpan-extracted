MediaWiki-API

This module provides an interface between perl and the MediaWiki API
(http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API) allowing creation of scripts to automate
editing and extraction of data from MediaWiki driven sites like Wikipedia.

The latest source/development version is available at
https://github.com/joolswills/mediawikiapi

STANDARD INSTALLATION

This module requires the following perl modules

    LWP::UserAgent
    URI::Escape
    JSON
    Encode
    Carp

and optionally JSON::XS for faster JSON decoding.

To install this module, run the following commands:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

Note: make test will make some edits on http://testwiki.exotica.org.uk/wiki/Main_Page
to check that it is working correctly. This will leave some data (including ip address)
on the wiki (which is cleaned regularly). If you do not want this, please skip the
"make test".

CREATING DEBIAN PACKAGE / INSTALLING ON DEBIAN

Please note that Debian squeeze and Ubuntu Karmic already have a package
with this module.

Note that this module requires the packages libwww-perl, libjson-perl, and
optionally libjson-xs-perl for faster JSON decoding.

On a debian system, you can easily generate a debian package to install. To
do this make sure you have the package "dh-make-perl" installed. Unpack the
MediaWiki-API-x.xx.tar.gz and run

dh-make-perl
dpkg-buildpackage

If everything works successfully you should have a deb file created in the
parent folder.
