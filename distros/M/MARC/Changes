	- linux command: h2xs -A -X -n MARC

0.61  Tue Sep  7 12:56:23 CDT 1999
	- convert version 0.6 into CPAN format (lots of little changes)

0.62  Fri Sep 10 05:18:00 1999
	- revised datastructure to hash of tags plus non-tag elements
	  like 'array' which serve as structured views into data

0.63  Sun Sep 12 20:38:00 1999
	- permit incremental processing to reduce memory footprint

0.65  Fri Sep 17 08:07:42 1999
	- add openmarc,nextmarc,closemarc,deletemarc

0.7   Sun Sep 21 07:15:00 1999
	- major upgrade: revise new for incremental reads and tag maps
	- add selectmarc,searchmarc, createrecord, _joinfield, addfield
	- add error processing and use Carp
	- add header/body/footer outputs
	- revise documentation

0.71  Wed Sep 22 15:50:31 1999
	- compute @tags once in _marc2html, fix $outputall detection
	- add Win32 test and install
	- t/test1.t uses new output file spec, tests append & $var

0.72  Fri Sep 24 07:42:00 1999
	- add getvalue
	- add doc example: xml_header, xml_body, xml_footer
	- add doc example: createrecord, addfield

0.80  Sun Oct  3 17:14:00 1999
	- add isbd and unimarc

0.81  Mon Oct  4 22:25:17 CDT 1999
	- update CPAN doc files: Changes, README, Makefile.PL
	- add isbd to t/test1.t

0.82  Wed Oct  6 13:30:22 CDT 1999
	- Win32 Makefile.PL improvements including automatic html install
	- Added single quotes to hash keys in MARC.pm and t/test1.t to
	  eliminate nuisance warnings from Perl 5.004.

0.83  Mon Oct 11 22:22:00 EST 1999
	- Updated MARC.pm line 108 to store scalar references instead of
	  scalars. This will hopefully cut down on duplication of data in
	  the MARC object.
	- Also, updated the getvalue(), searchmarc() and addfield() methods to 
	  reflect the change in the way subfield data is stored.
	- Added line 220 to return '0 but true' instead of 0 when no records
	  were read in. This will allow for statements like
	  $x->openmarc("test.mrc") || die;

0.84  Tue Oct 12 22:07:18 CDT 1999
	- more Win32 Makefile.PL tweaks after TPJ technical review
	- add binmode for marc file read/write
	- unspecified 'increment' defaults to 0
	- fix repeated subfield in field bug in addfield

0.85  Wed Oct 13 21:19:00 EST 1999
	- modified addfield to push scalar references instead of scalars when 
	  adding subfield data to the $x->[record]{field}{subfield} data member
	  on line 859.
	- updated closemarc to return 1, to allow constructs like
	  $x->closemarc() || die;

0.9   Sun Oct 17 19:48:00 EST 1999
	- modified deletemarc() to support deleting specified fields and
	  subfields
	- modified addfield() to support adding fields in tag order

0.91  Tue Oct 19 18:01:43 CDT 1999

		unpack_ldr,	bib_format,	unpack_008
	- add internal subroutines supporting those methods:
		_unpack_ldr,	_bib_format,	_unpack_008,
	- add internal update subroutines:

	- extensive changes to getvalue to cover '000' tag and indicators
	- use getvalue in unpack_008
	- return undef instead of die in _unpack_008
	- allow lineterm option in output, 'format' defaults to 'marc',
	  lineterm to '\n' except MARCMaker (CRLF)
	- add nolinebreak option for MARCBreaker output
	- 'html_header' outputs "Content-type...", 'html_start' does "<body>"
	- _writemarc also updates '000' size data in structure
	- warnings off in addfield

0.95d  Wed Nov 03 17:00:01 EST 1999 <Lane>
	- Removed FF_ prefix from @LDR_FIELDS. Left package globals for
          fixed fields and leaders as globals: this should facilitate
	  anybody who wants to subclass for MFHL, community, records.
	- Added pack_008 and pack_ldr. Added get_hash_008 and
	  get_hash_ldr for future tied interface. Fixed bugs. 
	  (FF_ prefixes in hash keys.)
	- Added and updated docs for the new functions.
	- Added comment on how to renumber tests.
	- Added tests of pack_008 and pack_ldr. Fixed some test bugs

	- fix addfield reorder bug (new tag > existing)
	- improved eg/addlocal.pl and added eg/uclocal.pl
	- moved binmode from _readmarc* to openmarc() and new() to get around
	  unwanted seek on binmode in Win32 5.00402.

0.99   Sun Nov 14 21:59:00 EST 1999 <Summers>
        - created MARC::XML subclass to handle MARC<->XML conversions
        - moved _marc2xml() from MARC.pm into MARC::XML

0.991  Sun Nov 21 18:49:00 EST 1999 <Summers>
        - removed MARC::XML specific pod from MARC.pm and added to MARC::XML

1.00   Mon Nov 22 22:22:32 CST 1999 <Birthisel>
	- add warnings for unsupported output formats
	- return undef for output failure, test in place of XML

1.01   Sun Dec 05 23:14:15 CST 1999 <Birthisel>
	- add invalid size checks to _readmarc()
	- add header check to _readmarcmaker()
	- delete length() method and CORE::length() overrides
	- add $TEST; replace carp with mycarp

1.02u  Mon Dec 20 06:52:00 EST 1999 <Lane>
	- added *map* series; supports a data-index view of marc.
	- added deletefirst and updatefirst to support ties
	- added getmatch and insertpos to support update or insert
	   of subfields.
	- added getfields/updatefields for fine-grained access to
	   the {array} structures. Allows "in-place" update of fields.
	- changed add_fields to use add_map. Lets subclasses have a
	   policy of how they want their indices to look.
	- changed _readmarc and _readmarcmaker to use add_map. Good
	   for testing.
	- Added simple tests for *first and *map* series as test4.t
	   More complex and complete tests are in MARC::Tie.
	- Added docs for *map*, getmatch,*fields*,getmatch and insertpos.

1.03   Mon Jan 17 15:21:54 CST 2000 <Birthisel>
	- Use fill char "|" for "none" in eg/addlocal.pl
	- integrate "102u" changes into CPAN format
	- fix bug in addfield where add_map not called if ($tag<10)

1.04   Mon Jan 24 22:31:26 CST 2000 <Birthisel>
	- oops, had to fix the Win32 5.00402 binmode again (c.f 0.98)
	- added quotes to 'rebuild_map' used as hash key (5.004 warnings)
	- add docs for "keys" in hash returned by 'unpack_ldr'
	- add xml format error messages

1.05   Sat Jan 29 22:59:03 EST 2000 <Lane>
	- Removed unnecessary quotes in various potentially tainted variables.
	- Removed bad references to FF_* in docs.
	- Updatefields() no longer assumes that fields with the same tag are 
	  contiguous (e.g. cjk).
	- Getfields() no longer assumes that fields with the same tag are 
	  contiguous (again, cjk).
	- Docs updated to reflect the relaxed assumption.
	- Extensive quoting of keys for a more warning-free experience.
	
	Sun Jan 30 14:34:02 EST 2000 <Lane>
	- Created add_005s(), _make_005().
	- Inserted add_005s into output so now we are correctly datestamped.
	- Docs added for 005 functionality.
	
	Mon Jan 31 12:55:52 EST 2000 <Lane>
	- Fixed $args->{'record'} complaint if $args does not exist.
	- Now we return "19960221075055.7" when in $TEST mode for 005.
	- Fixed and updated test2.t and test files makrbrkr.mrc and
	  makrtest.src. (now have all canonical 005's; makrtest had a
	  17 digit time, not 16 in the first record).

1.06   Sun Feb 27 22:00:00 EST 2000 <Lane>
	- Added getfirstvalue to avoid dependency on index for Ties.
	- Added from_string and as_string; mainly for Tie
	  but also has promise for searchmarc. Added option to rebuild map. 
	- Created MARC::Rec and started moving functions to it.

	Thu Mar  9 22:00:00 EST 2000 <Lane>
	- Finished the bulk of ::Rec-ising.
	- Normalised {records}-{record} handling and %params creation 
	  (_records and _params).
	- Updated searchmarc and deletemarc to more idiomatic Perl; fixed bugs.
	  (Deletemarc was not updating {$tag}{$field}{subfield} information
	  correctly; it does now since it uses rebuild_map).
	- Fixed one potential problem in _urls (looked at indicators when it
	  should have only been looking at subfields).

	Sat Mar 11 22:00:00 EST 2000 <Lane>
	- Checked that a subclass of MARC(:Btrieve) works even in the presence
	  of MARC::Rec dependencies.
	- Tested Tie::MARC and Tie::MARC::Btrieve against 1.06
	- Fixed bugs. All tests pass.
	- Updated Docs to reflect pervasive MARC::Rec presence and (few)
	  additional functions.

	Sun Mar 12 14:39:27 EST 2000 <Lane>
	- Configured shipping script for MARC.
	- Fixed numbering in test5.t. All tests pass.
	- Added option to read from a string for MARC::Rec. (nextmarc())

1.07   Sun Apr 23 16:41:46 CDT 2000A <Birthisel>
	- convert all usage to $MARC::TEST, $MARC::DEBUG. Clean up other
	  "use vars" variables only needed in one package. Sync $VERSION.
	- Perl 5.6.0 warns on "join (//,", use "join (''," instead.
	- fixes to $naptime and $testfile in t/test5.t
	- openmarc did not set 'handle' and 'format' for MARC::Rec
