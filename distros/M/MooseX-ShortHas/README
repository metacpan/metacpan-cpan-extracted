NAME

    MooseX::ShortHas - shortcuts for common Moose has attribute
    configurations

VERSION

    version 1.222491

SYNOPSIS

    Instead of:

        use Moose;
        
        has hro => is => ro => required => 1;
        has hlazy => is => lazy => builder => sub { 2 };
        has hrwp => is => rwp => required => 1;
        has hrw => is => rw => required => 1;

    You can now write:

        use Moose;
        use MooseX::ShortHas;
        
        ro "hro";
        lazy hlazy => sub { 2 };
        rwp "hrwp";
        rw "hrw";

    And options can be added or overriden by appending them:

        ro hro_opt => required => 0;

DESCRIPTION

    Moose's has asks developers to repeat themselves a lot to set up
    attributes, and since its inceptions the most common configurations of
    attributes have crystallized through long usage.

    This module provides sugar shortcuts that wrap around has under the
    appropriate names to reduce the effort of setting up an attribute to
    naming it with a shortcut.

EXPORTS

 ro, rwp, rw

    These three work the same, they convert a call like this:

        ro $name => @extra_args;

    To this corresponding has call:

        has $name => is => ro => required => 1 => @extra_args;

    The appending of extra args makes it easy to override the required if
    necessary.

 lazy

    This one is slightly different than the others, as lazy arguments don't
    require a constructor value, but almost always want a builder of some
    kind:

        lazy $name => @extra_args;

    Corresponds to:

        has $name => is => lazy => builder => @extra_args;

    The first extra argument is thus expected to be any of the values
    appropriate for the builder option.
