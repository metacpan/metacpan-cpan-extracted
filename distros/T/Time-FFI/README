NAME

    Time::FFI - libffi interface to POSIX date and time functions

SYNOPSIS

      use Time::FFI qw(localtime mktime strptime strftime);
    
      my $tm = strptime '1995-01-02 13:15:39', '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S';
      my $epoch = mktime $tm;
      print "$epoch: ", strftime('%I:%M:%S %p on %B %e, %Y', $tm);
      my $piece = $tm->to_object('Time::Piece', 1);
    
      my $tm = localtime time;
      my $datetime = $tm->to_object('DateTime', 1);
    
      my $tm = gmtime time;
      my $moment = $tm->to_object('Time::Moment', 0);

DESCRIPTION

    Time::FFI provides a libffi interface to POSIX date and time functions
    found in time.h.

    The "gmtime" and "localtime" functions behave very differently from the
    core functions of the same name, as well as those exported by
    Time::Piece, so you may wish to call them as e.g. Time::FFI::gmtime
    rather than importing them.

    All functions will throw an exception in the event of an error. For
    functions other than "strftime" and "strptime", this exception will
    contain the syscall error message, and "$!" in perlvar will also have
    been set by the syscall, so you could check it after trapping the
    exception for finer exception handling.

FUNCTIONS

    All functions are exported individually, or with the :all export tag.

 asctime

      my $str = asctime $tm;

    Returns a string in the format Wed Jun 30 21:49:08 1993\n representing
    the passed Time::FFI::tm record. The thread-safe asctime_r(3) function
    is used if available.

 ctime

      my $str = ctime $epoch;
      my $str = ctime;

    Returns a string in the format Wed Jun 30 21:49:08 1993\n representing
    the passed epoch timestamp (defaulting to the current time) in the
    local time zone. This is equivalent to "ctime" in POSIX but uses the
    thread-safe ctime_r(3) function if available.

 gmtime

      my $tm = gmtime $epoch;
      my $tm = gmtime;

    Returns a Time::FFI::tm record representing the passed epoch timestamp
    (defaulting to the current time) in UTC. The thread-safe gmtime_r(3)
    function is used if available.

 localtime

      my $tm = localtime $epoch;
      my $tm = localtime;

    Returns a Time::FFI::tm record representing the passed epoch timestamp
    (defaulting to the current time) in the local time zone. The
    thread-safe localtime_r(3) function is used if available.

 mktime

      my $epoch = mktime $tm;

    Returns the epoch timestamp representing the passed Time::FFI::tm
    record interpreted in the local time zone.

 strftime

      my $str = strftime $format, $tm;

    Returns a string formatted according to the passed format string,
    representing the passed Time::FFI::tm record. Consult your system's
    strftime(3) manual for available format descriptors.

 strptime

      my $tm = strptime $str, $format;
         $tm = strptime $str, $format, $tm;
      my $tm = strptime $str, $format, undef, \my $remaining;
         $tm = strptime $str, $format, $tm, \my $remaining;

    Returns a Time::FFI::tm record representing the passed string, parsed
    according to the passed format. Consult your system's strptime(3)
    manual for available format descriptors.

    A Time::FFI::tm record may be passed as the third argument, in which
    case it will be modified in place to (on most systems) update only the
    date/time elements which were parsed from the string. Additionally, an
    optional scalar reference may be passed as the fourth argument, in
    which case it will be set to the remaining unprocessed characters of
    the input string if any.

    This function is usually not available on Windows.
