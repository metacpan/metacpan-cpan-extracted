Revision history for Rinci

1.1.84  2016-12-28 (PERLANCAR)

        - No spec changes.

        - [dist] Remove spec prereq to Sah::Schemas since Sah::Schema::rinci::*
          have been split to Sah-Schemas-Rinci.

        - [dist] Fix expressing spec prereq relationship with x_spec.


1.1.83  2016-12-15 (PERLANCAR)

	- Specify that dry_run feature can also be a hash, to be able to
	  set default dry_run mode.


1.1.82  2016-12-10 (PERLANCAR)

	- Introduce argument spec property 'index_completion'.

	- Typo [RT#118381].


1.1.81  2016-07-28 (PERLANCAR)

	- No spec changes.

	- Split Sah schemas to Sah-Schemas-Rinci so that schema tweaks
	  don't require releasing a new spec release.


1.1.80  2016-05-10 (PERLANCAR)

	- No spec changes.

	- [Incompatible change] Follow Sah::Schemas spec (each individual schema
          is put in a separate Sah::Schema::* package). Sah::Schema::Rinci is
          now replaced with Sah::Schema::rinci::* packages.


1.1.79  2016-02-25 (PERLANCAR)

	- Define new command-line source for function argument
	  (cmdline_src): stdin_or_args.


1.1.78  2015-09-03 (PERLANCAR)

	- No spec changes.

	- [dist] Move spec prereqs from RuntimeRequires to
	  DevelopRecommends to reduce deps but still allow indicating spec
	  requirement.


1.1.77  2015-05-01 (PERLANCAR)

	- No spec changes.

	- Typos (args_rels, not args_schema) & wording.


1.1.76  2015-04-30 (PERLANCAR)

	- Replace function property 'args_groups' with 'args_rels'. This
          allows us to reuse the Sah 0.9.34+ specification, since the hash type
          now also contains clauses that specifies relationships between keys
          (arguments), e.g. choose_one, choose_all, req_one, req_all, dep_one,
          dep_all, req_dep_one, req_dep_all.


1.1.75  2015-03-28 (PERLANCAR)

	- Add (experimental) argument specification: filters.


1.1.74  2015-03-18 (PERLANCAR)

        - [Incompatible change] Use DefHash's 'caption' property for link title,
          instead of using another ('title').

        - Introduce another value for 'cmdline_src' argument spec property:
          'stdin_or_file' (in addition to 'stdin_or_files').


1.1.73  2015-02-07 (PERLANCAR)

	- No spec changes.

	- Forgot to update schema.


1.1.72  2015-02-07 (PERLANCAR)

	- Introduce function property 'args_groups' to allow things like
	  requiring {only one,all} members of a group of args must be specified
	  (and possibly others in the future). UPDATE: Now replaced with
	  'args_rels'.

	- Specify argument specification property 'deps', to allow an argument
	  to depend on others.


1.1.71  2015-01-17 (PERLANCAR)

	- Specify that streaming input and output now uses coderef instead of
	  filehandle/etc. This is simpler and has the side-effects of easier to
	  do wrapping for (see Perinci::Sub::Wrapper) where one can just wrap
	  the coderef to do per-record validation of streaming input/output.


1.1.70  2014-11-19 (PERLANCAR)

	- Add 'links' property to arg spec.


1.1.69  2014-10-30 (PERLANCAR)

	- No spec changes.

	- [Bugfix] forgot to update Sah schema.


1.1.68  2014-10-30 (PERLANCAR)

	- Forgot to mention 'stream' argument spec property.


1.1.67  2014-10-30 (PERLANCAR)

        [INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES]

        - Tweaks/changes to sending of partial argument value: feature
          'partial_arg' is removed as it is redundant (argument property
          'partial' already hints this capability). When sending partial value,
          aside from '-arg_part_start' and '-arg_part_len', client now must also
          send '-arg_len' which is the total size. This is to follow more
          closely with HTTP Content-Range semantic.

        - Tweaks/changes to returning partial result: feature 'partial_res' is
          removed, function can now instead hint using the 'partial' property in
          its 'result' property. Result metadata properties 'res_part_start' and
          'res_part_len' are now renamed to 'part_start' and 'part_len'. 'len'
          is now also added to return information on total size (to follow HTTP
          Content-Range semantic more closely).

        [ENHANCEMENTS]

        - Introduce argument property 'stream' to signify accepting input
          stream. Input stream (like stdin) is a basic feature in most
          programming environment so it should be supported. Implementation of
          command-line framework will provide a filehandle for the argument,
          where the function can read data from.

        - Introduce result metadata property 'stream' to signify output is a
          stream. Output stream (like stdout) is a basic feature in most
          programming environment so it should be supported. This feature is
          actually already in Unixish for some time.


1.1.66  2014-10-29 (PERLANCAR)

        - Currently limit that there should at most be one argument with
          partial=1. The special arguments become just '-arg_part_start' and
          '-arg_part_len'.


1.1.65  2014-10-29 (PERLANCAR)

	- No spec changes.

	- [Bugfix] Forgot to update Sah schema.


1.1.64  2014-10-29 (PERLANCAR)

        [ENHANCEMENTS]

        - Introduce sending partial arguments and returning partial result,
          similar in spirit to Ranges in HTTP/1.1. New argument specification
          properties: 'partial'. New features: 'partial_arg', 'partial_res'. New
          special arguments: '-arg_part_start', '-arg_part_len',
          '-res_part_start', '-res_part_len'. New result metadata properties:
          'res_part_start', 'res_part_len'. UPDATE in 1.1.67: 'partial_res' is
          removed, '-res_part_start' & '-res_part_len' renamed to 'part_start &
          part_len'.


1.1.63  2014-10-28 (PERLANCAR)

        [ENHANCEMENTS]

        - Introduce statuses 201, 204.

        [INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES]

        - Introduce status 207. Replace result metadata properties 'arg_errors'
          & 'arg_warnings' with the more generic 'results' to report
          per-item/detailed statuses.


1.1.62  2014-10-23 (PERLANCAR)

        [REMOVED FEATURES]

        - Cancel support for 'encoding' (in result metadata as well in argument
          specification and result specification). This is an issue with JSON
          which cannot handle binary data and should be handled in the Riap
          level, not Rinci. Note: to mark a function argument or result as
          containing binary data, use the schema type 'buf'.


1.1.61  2014-10-22 (PERLANCAR)

        - Introduce 'encoding' property in result specification, to give hints
          to tools that function wants to encode its result by default. Said
          tool can encode the result and set the 'encoding' property in the
          result metadata. UPDATE in 1.1.62: removed.


1.1.60  2014-10-22 (PERLANCAR)

        - No spec changes.

        - Forgot to update Sah schemas.


1.1.59  2014-10-22 (PERLANCAR)

        - Update to DefHash 1.0.6 (introduced 'caption' property, which actually
          doesn't affect us much).

        - Introduce 'encoding' property in result metadata and argument
          specification. Currently the only known encoding is 'base64'. This is
          for functions that want to accept/return binary data, when transport
          protocol (e.g. 'json' format in Riap) does not support binary data
          (one can also use binary-safe formats in Riap e.g. Storable or Sereal,
          but this is not widely supported across languages like JSON). Tools
          can be written to support automatic decoding of function arguments and
          automatic encoding of function result. In Perl, see CPAN module
          Perinci::Sub::Wrapper. UPDATE in 1.1.62: removed.

        - Introduce 'arg_errors' and 'arg_warnings' properties in result
          metadata. This is for functions that do form processing, because often
          we want to send the error message for all non-validating arguments
          (form fields) instead of just the first one found. In Perl, see CPAN
          module Borang. UPDATE in 1.1.63: replaced with 'results'.

        - Introduce '-action' special argument and the 'check_arg' feature. The
          '-action' can toggle special invocation modes to the function. This is
          like '-tx_action' except is not necessarily related to transactions.
          Currently the only known action is 'check_arg', to check a single
          argument. This is for functions that do form processing, e.g. when
          user is editing a form field on the browser and we do AJAX calls to
          do validation as user types.


1.1.58  2014-10-16 (PERLANCAR)

	- No functional changes.

	- Rename Rinci::result -> Rinci::resmeta.


1.1.57  2014-10-11 (PERLANCAR)

	- Introduce is_flag bool property on command-line alias. This is just a
          convenience so you don't have to write: schema => [bool => {is=>1}].


1.1.56  2014-10-10 (PERLANCAR)

	- Introduce argument element submetadata (element_meta property in
	  argument specification, experimental). This is to support forms.


1.1.55  2014-10-09 (PERLANCAR)

	- Introduce argument submetadata (experimental). This is to support
          forms where one submits form (including subforms) to a function.


1.1.54  2014-09-12 (PERLANCAR)

	- Add result metadata property: perm_err.

        - Add FAQ and other POD tweaks.


1.1.53  2014-09-11 (PERLANCAR)

	- Introduce function argument spec properties: cmdline_prompt,
	  is_password. This is to enable CLI programs to prompt password
	  interactively.


1.1.52   2014-06-29 (SHARYANTO)

         - Allow completion routine to return hash (completion reply + metadata)
           instead of just array (completion reply), as already implemented in
           Perinci::Sub::Complete and Complete::Util. This allows giving hints
           on how to escape completion entries (which might be different
           depending on the type of completion, e.g. files vs environment
           variables where we don't want to escape '$', and so on).


1.1.51   2014-06-25 (SHARYANTO)

         - No spec changes.

         - Tweak/fix Sah schema.


1.1.50   2014-06-13 (SHARYANTO)

         [INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES]

         - Revert previous change (args/as -> args_as; args/as conflicts with
           actual arguments!). Revert result/is_naked -> result_naked too, not
           worth the trouble of breaking every function out there. What was
           steven-- thinking?


1.1.49   2014-06-13 (SHARYANTO)

         [INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES]

         - Rename args_as to args/as, result_naked to result/is_naked to make
           top-level properties cleaner. Implementation should still support the
           old properties for a while. UPDATE in 1.1.50: renamed back.

        [BUG FIXES]

        - Checking dep func/pkg should be done using Riap info action and not
          meta.


1.1.48   2014-05-28 (SHARYANTO)

         - function: Specify two new function dependency: pkg & func.


1.1.47   2014-05-01 (SHARYANTO)

         - No spec changes.

         - Tweak/fix schema.


1.1.46   2014-04-30 (SHARYANTO)

         - No spec changes.

         - Tweak/fix schema.


1.1.45   2014-04-28 (SHARYANTO)

         - No spec changes.

         - Tweak schema.


1.1.44   2014-04-27 (SHARYANTO)

         - Add Sah::Schema::Rinci (replaces Rinci::Schema).

         [REMOVED FEATURES]

         - function: Remove argument spec's 'cmdline_on_getarg' (for now?)
           because the current implementation does not allow calling the hook on
           a per-encountered basis (the argv is remainder from Getopt::Long
           after all the options have been processed).


1.1.43   2013-12-25 (SHARYANTO) - Ho ho ho!

         - function: Add argument spec's 'cmdline_on_getopt' and
           'cmdline_on_getarg'. UPDATE in 1.1.44: 'cmdline_on_getarg' removed.


1.1.42   2013-11-14 (SHARYANTO)

         - function: Add argument spec's 'delete' and 'element_completion'
           properties.


1.1.41   2013-11-08 (SHARYANTO)

         - function: Introduce value 'file' for argument spec property
           'cmdline_src', to allow function to get file content in its
           argument.

         - function: Introduce property 'test' on example spec, to allow test
           module to skip testing a certain examples.


1.1.40   2013-10-28 (SHARYANTO)

         - result: Add properties 'func.*'.


1.1.39   2013-10-15 (SHARYANTO) - with the smell of burning goat meat in the house!

         - function: examples: Introduce 'src' and 'src_plang' so that more
           general examples can be specified.

         - function: cmdline_aliases: 'code' now gets (\%args, $val) instead of
           just (\%args).


1.1.38   2013-09-15 (SHARYANTO)

         - result: Add property 'logs'.


1.1.37   2013-09-13 (SHARYANTO)

         - result: Replace property 'error_stack' with 'prev'.


1.1.36   2013-09-07 (SHARYANTO)

         - Rename property 'entity_version' to 'entity_v' to be more consistent
           with DefHash ('defhash_v').


1.1.35   2013-04-11 (SHARYANTO)

         - Introduce property 'x' (from DefHash 1.0.3).


1.1.34   2012-11-07 (SHARYANTO)

         - function: Introduce status 44x and 54x (experimental).


1.1.33   2012-11-07 (SHARYANTO)

         - No spec changes. (Temporarily?) split Rinci::Schema to its own dist
           so I can release them often separately. UPDATE in 1.1.44:
           Rinci::Schema replaced with Sah::Schema::Rinci.


1.1.32   2012-11-01 (SHARYANTO)

         - result: Add property 'error_stack'.

         - function: property 'result': Add key 'statuses'.


1.1.31   2012-09-19 (SHARYANTO)

         - Base specification on DefHash.

         - Remove 'text_markup' property. Will depend on DefHash for this.


1.1.30   2012-09-07 (SHARYANTO)

         - No spec changes. Rename back a file (Rinci/Schema.pm) that I thought
           was not used (me--). [CT]


1.1.29   2012-09-04 (SHARYANTO)

         - Transaction: In 'check_state' phase, specify that result message
           should contain a description of what needs to be fixed, or how it is
           already fixed, or how it is unfixable; the message can then be logged
           by TM to be displayed to user.


1.1.28   2012-08-29 (SHARYANTO)

         [INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE]

         - Transaction: To link between 'check_state' call and 'fix_state' call
           (e.g. function want to preserve some value between call), previously
           in 'fix_state' call TM passes '-tx_undo_actions' containing the undo
           actions from the 'check_state'. Now a simpler way is introduced to
           replace this: '-tx_action_id' containing a unique UUID (in
           32-character hexdigit). BTW, '-tx_undo_actions' has not been
           implemented in Perinci::Tx::Manager, so the next release of
           Perinci::Tx::Manager will just implement '-tx_action_id'.


1.1.27   2012-08-28 (SHARYANTO)

         - Introduce status code 331.

         - Mark which status codes are in HTTP spec, which are introduced by us.


1.1.26   2012-08-22 (SHARYANTO)

         - Term change: call -> action.


1.1.25   2012-08-22 (SHARYANTO)

         [INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES]

         - Remove properties 'use' and 'req' in 'tx' feature. This is to make
           things simpler. use=>1 is redundant, if function follows transaction
           protocol it means you can use it in transaction. req=>1 is also
           removed, all functions should just require transaction and
           potentially return 'do_actions'. A simple wrapper can be created to
           execute those actions without transaction, if wanted.


1.1.24   2012-08-21 (SHARYANTO)

         [INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES]

         - Deprecate undo protocol, now undo should be implemented solely using
           transaction.

         - Revise transaction specification. Introduce protocol version (v) and
           bump it to v=2. Require 'tx' feature to specify protocol version.
           Incompatibilities include: 1) transaction now no longer uses undo
           protocol but adapts mechanism from Perinci::Sub::Gen::Undoable (which
           will also be deprecated as the mechanism is now elevated into
           standards); 2) TM object no longer needs to be passed to function,
           this should be safer; function now detects transaction using
           '-tx_action' special argument.

         [ENHANCEMENTS]

         - Specify TM's interface in more details (moved from Riap::Transaction,
           which now becomes shorter).

         - Specify steps for action, rollback, and crash recovery in more
           details, with example.


1.1.23   2012-08-14 (SHARYANTO)

         - Major rewrite of transaction specification. The main motivation is to
           remove the concept of 'steps' as this is a false dichotomy. Steps are
           actually functions themselves, the units of work are still functions.
           Eventually, a complex system will need to nest functions inside
           functions, to more than two levels of nesting. Why divide and limit
           into two levels (function-step)? So:

         - Everything is a bit clearer now

         - $tm interface is saner ($tm->call, easier to call function inside
           another)

         - No more mention of unused transaction status: e

         - New transaction statuses: v (rollback of undoing process), e
           (rollback of redoing process).

         - Recovery does not always mean rollback (to R). For transactions in u
           and d status, we continue the undoing/redoing. For transactions in v
           and e status, we continue the rollback to final status C and U,
           respectively.


1.1.22   2012-08-09 (SHARYANTO)

         - tx: Describe the ordering of calls during undo/rollback/redo when
           there is nested call. The same function may be called twice or more
           with parts of undo/redo steps.

         - tx: In transaction mode, function now gets undo/redo data from the
           usual -undo_data special argument, like in non-transaction mode.
           Txm's API get_undo_steps() and get_redo_steps() are now removed.


1.1.21   2012-07-23 (SHARYANTO)

         [INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES]

         - function: Remove argument specification key 'src', use 'cmdline_src'
           instead. I think 'src' is too general.


1.1.20   2012-07-21 (SHARYANTO)

         - function: Add argument specification keys 'src' and 'cmdline_src'.
           UPDATE in 1.1.21: 'src' removed.


1.1.19   2012-06-22 (SHARYANTO)

         - Adjust transaction status labels. Final statuses are now in
           uppercase: C, R, U, X; while transient statuses are in lowercase: i,
           a, u, d, e.

         - Add response status 429 (too many requests).


1.1.18   2012-06-06 (SHARYANTO)

         - Refinements to transaction details.

         - Remove dependency clause 'undo_storage'. Add dependency clauses
           'tmp_dir', 'trash_dir', 'undo_trash_dir'.


1.1.17   2012-05-31 (SHARYANTO)

         - Specify transactional system (Rinci::function::Transaction). Split
           specification for undo to Rinci::function::Undo and specify undo/redo
           protocol under transaction. UPDATE in 1.1.24: Undo protocol
           deprecated.


1.1.16   2012-05-03 (SHARYANTO)

         - Refine undo protocol documentation. Specify interaction with
           undo/transaction manager. '-undo_hint' is now replaced by
           '-undo_storage'. Declare 'undo_storage' dependency clause. UPDATE
           in 1.1.24: Undo protocol deprecated in favor of transaction.


1.1.15   2012-05-02 (SHARYANTO)

         - No spec changes.

         [INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE]

         - Update Sah schema syntax (pre-0.03, [merge:X] -> [mergeX])


1.1.14   2012-05-02 (SHARYANTO)

         [INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE]

         - Change 'exec' dependency clause to 'prog' (avoid possible confusion
           because 'exec' can imply that we need to execute the program; there
           can be other future dep clause for that).


1.1.13   2012-03-23 (SHARYANTO)

         [ENHANCEMENTS]

         - Each tag in 'tags' property can also be a tag metadata hash (for
           translatable message, etc).


1.1.12   2012-03-13 (SHARYANTO)

         [ENHANCEMENTS]

         - Add 'Rinci::result'.


1.1.11   2012-03-13 (SHARYANTO)

         [INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES]

         - package: Remove property 'pkg_version' (use 'entity_version'
           instead).

         [ENHANCEMENTS]

         - Add property 'entity_version'. UPDATE in 1.1.36: renamed to
           'entity_v'.


1.1.10   2012-02-28 (SHARYANTO)

         - function: arg spec 'aliases': Add alias spec 'schema'


1.1.9    2012-02-28 (SHARYANTO)

         [INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE]

         - function: Change (back) 'set' alias spec to 'code', in arg spec
           'aliases' (for backward compatibility with 1.0)


1.1.8    2012-02-28 (SHARYANTO)

         [INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES]

         - function: Replace (back) 'alias_for' argument spec with
           'cmdline_aliases'. I first used 'alias_for' so I can list each alias
           as a key in 'args' property. The goal is so I can get all argument
           names (- aliases) simply by doing a keys() on 'args' hash. And the
           goal of that is to add a 'complete_arg_name' Riap action which is
           more lightweight than a full 'meta' just to get argument names. Turns
           out that I don't need 'alias_for' just to support
           'complete_arg_name', and also turns out that completing argument name
           needs more than just all argument names - aliases. You also need
           'pos' information. So a full 'meta' is currently used. The reason I
           now revert to 'cmdline_aliases' style is because I don't want
           command-line aliases to become full/first-class argument.


1.1.7    2012-02-23 (SHARYANTO)

         - package: Add property 'pkg_version'. UPDATE in 1.1.11 & 1.1.36:
           replaced by 'entity_v'.


1.1.6    2012-02-21 (SHARYANTO)

         - function: Add 'alias_for' argument specification. UPDATE 1.1.8:
           removed.


1.1.5    2012-02-10 (SHARYANTO)

         - No spec changes.

         - Add Rinci::Schema.


1.1.4    2012-02-01 (SHARYANTO)

         - Declare that 1.1 series might introduce minor backward compatibility
           problems between revisions.

         - Rename 'arg_pass_style' and 'result_envelope' to the old
           (Sub::Spec-era) 'args_as' and 'result_naked'. New names are not
           better.

         - Code entity URI now moved to Riap specification as the 'riap' URI
           scheme.

         - Some minor revisions.


1.1.3    2012-01-27 (SHARYANTO)

         - Change syntax of code entity URI, from 'Pkg.SubPkg.func' to
           'pm:/Pkg/SubPkg/func' (or 'py:', 'php:', and so on).

         - Some minor revisions like wording and paragraph reorganization.


1.1.2    2012-01-19 (SHARYANTO)

         - Add 'default_lang' property. Add guidelines on what to put in 'summary'
           and 'description'.

         - variable: Add 'schema' property.


1.1.1    2012-01-18 (SHARYANTO)

         - No spec changes. Update module names (Rinci::HTTP -> Riap, Rias ->
           Perinci). Add documents Rinci::Upgrading and Rinci::Tutorial (stub).


1.1.0    2012-01-15 (SHARYANTO)

         - First release. Spun off from Sub::Spec.

         [INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES FROM Sub::Spec 1.0.x]

         - Terminology: 'spec clause' becomes 'property'. This is to avoid
           confusion with 'clause' as used in Sah schema language.

         - Default text markup format changed from Org to Markdown, but a new
           properties 'text_markup' is added to allow specifying 'org' or
           'markdown' (or 'none'). UPDATE in 1.1.31: 'text_markup' property
           removed.

         - 'v' clause is now required to declare Rinci spec version (with value
           1.1, if unspecified then assumed spec is old Sub::Spec 1.0).

         - function: Incompatible changes to 'args' and 'result' properties;
           'args' is now a hash of arg names and arg *specs* (instead of arg
           schemas). 'result' is now a hash of data, instead of schema. The
           purpose is to keep Sah schema clean from custom, non-schema-related
           schema clauses, like arg_* (thus requiring custom Sah extensions,
           etc). Mixing them into schemas was not the right way.

         - function: property 'type' removed, replaced with 'is_func',
           'is_meth', 'is_static_meth'. This is because a single
           subroutine/function can act as all.

         - function: Other properties which are also removed/replaced: 'timeout'
           (non-core), 'retry' (non-core), 'scope' (can be replaced by using
           tags), 'result_naked' (replaced by 'result_envelope'), 'args_as'
           (replaced by 'arg_pass_style'). UPDATE in 1.1.4: 'arg_pass_style'
           renamed back to 'args_as', 'result_envelope' renamed back to
           'result_naked'.

         - function: property 'deps': terminology change ('dep clause' -> 'dep
           type'), rename dep types: 'sub' -> 'func', 'mod' -> 'perl_module'.

         [NEW FEATURES FROM Sub::Spec 1.0.x]

         - Keys beginning with "_" are allowed and ignored. This can be used to
           store extra information.

         - New properties: 'tags', 'links', 'examples'.
