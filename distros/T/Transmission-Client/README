NAME
    Transmission::Client - Interface to Transmission

VERSION
    0.0805

DESCRIPTION
    Transmission::Client is the main module in a collection of modules to
    communicate with Transmission. Transmission is:

     Transmission is a cross-platform BitTorrent client that is:
      * Easy
      * Lean
      * Native
      * Powerful
      * Free

    If you want to communicate with "transmission-daemon", this is a module
    which can help you with that.

    The documentation is half copy/paste from the Transmission RPC spec:
    <https://trac.transmissionbt.com/browser/trunk/extras/rpc-spec.txt>

    This module differs from P2P::Transmission in (at least) two ways: This
    one use Moose and it won't die. The latter is especially annoying in the
    constructor.

SYNOPSIS
     use Transmission::Client;

     my $client = Transmission::Client->new;
     my $torrent_id = 2;
     my $data = base64_encoded_data();

     $client->add(metainfo => $data) or confess $client->error;
     $client->remove($torrent_id) or confess $client->error;

     for my $torrent (@{ $client->torrents }) {
        print $torrent->name, "\n";
        for my $file (@{ $torrent->files }) {
            print "> ", $file->name, "\n";
        }
     }

     print $client->session->download_dir, "\n";

FAULT HANDLING
    In 0.06 Transmission::Client can be constructed with "autodie" set to
    true, to make this object confess instead of just setting "error".
    Example:

        my $client = Transmission::Client->new(autodie => 1);

        eval {
            $self->add(filename => 'foo.torrent');
        } or do {
            # add() failed...
        };

SEE ALSO
    Transmission::AttributeRole Transmission::Session Transmission::Torrent
    Transmission::Utils

ATTRIBUTES
  url
     $str = $self->url;

    Returns an URL to where the Transmission rpc api is. Default value is
    "http://localhost:9091/transmission/rpc";

  error
     $str = $self->error;

    Returns the last error known to the object. All methods can return empty
    list in addition to what specified. Check this attribute if so happens.

    Like "autodie"? Create your object with "autodie" set to true and this
    module will throw exceptions in addition to setting this variable.

  username
     $str = $self->username;

    Used to authenticate against Transmission.

  password
     $str = $self->password;

    Used to authenticate against Transmission.

  timeout
     $int = $self->timeout;

    Number of seconds to wait for RPC response.

  session
     $session_obj = $self->session;
     $stats_obj = $self->stats;

    Returns an instance of Transmission::Session. "stats()" is a proxy
    method on "session".

  torrents
     $array_ref = $self->torrents;
     $self->clear_torrents;

    Returns an array-ref of Transmission::Torrent objects. Default value is
    a full list of all known torrents, with as little data as possible read
    from Transmission. This means that each request on a attribute on an
    object will require a new request to Transmission. See "read_torrents"
    for more information.

  version
     $str = $self->version;

    Get Transmission version.

  session_id
     $self->session_id($str);
     $str = $self->session_id;

    The session ID used to communicate with Transmission.
