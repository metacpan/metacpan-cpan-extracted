This original documentation for Mail::SRS version 0.10 is no longer
relevant to newer versions of this module, but it is preserved here
for posterity just in case of questions. See also README.pobox.

The Sender Rewriting Scheme preserves .forward functionality
in an SPF-compliant world.

This module should be considered alpha at this
time. Documentation is incomplete. Pobox.com decided to
publish Mail::SRS to CPAN anyway because there seems to be
a fair amount of interest out there in implementing SRS.

SPF requires the SMTP client IP to match the envelope sender
(return-path).  When a message is forwarded through an
intermediate server, that intermediate server may need to
rewrite the return-path to remain SPF compliant.  If the
message bounces, that intermediate server needs to validate
the bounce and forward the bounce to the original sender.

SRS provides a convention for return-path rewriting which
allows multiple forwarding servers to compact the return-path.
SRS also provides an authentication mechanism to ensure that
purported bounces are not arbitrarily forwarded.

SRS is documented at http://spf.pobox.com/srs.html

A given SRS address is valid for one month by default.

Cookies are relatively unique.
