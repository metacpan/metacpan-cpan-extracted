    * Retooling Dist::Zilla config for modern times.
    * (HT: srezic) Fixing missing prereqs in an attempt to fix broken tests
    * Adding a .travis.yml config to setup CI testing for myself

0.021   February 15, 2015

    * (HT: zoffixznet) Corrected the use of enum to fix deprecation warnings.
    * (HT: zoffixznet) Fix the use of load_class to fix deprecation warnings.
    * Replace apply_metaclass_roles with apply_metaroles.
    * Fix some problems with the way the code is released.
    * Convert to Test::Class::Moose because Test::Able has not been maintained
      and because OVID is awesome.
    * Fix test failures related to _build_label being run too soon on labeled
      controls. (Fixed by making labels build lazily.)

0.020   September 7, 2010

    * Correcting some POD problems
    * Removing the sub around legal_options_for_inheritance in
      Form::Factory::Action::Meta::Attribute::Control as this has been removed
      in Moose 1.09, in favor of illegal_options_for_inheritance.
    * Moose 1.09 is required.

0.019   May 21, 2010

    * Correct tests that started failing with Moose 1.02 because Form::Factory
      mistakenly used "Regexp" as a type, when "RegexpRef" was meant.

0.018   March 23, 2010

    * Added Form::Factory::Process::Role and related changes to make it possible
      to build form actions by composing roles

0.017   February 23, 2010

    * Added the slot option to fill_on_assignment

0.016   February 18, 2010

    * Added the InitializeControl control feature role
    * Converting fill_on_assignment to an InitializeControl so that it will work
      properly with value conversion features
    * Correcting a bug that broke control value converter features
    * Correcting some of the documentation
    * Adding a new test for value conversions

0.015   February 17, 2010

    * COMPATIBIILTTY: Controls no longer have a stashable_keys attribute. It was
      essentially the same for all controls and should be a metaclass attribute
      if it needs to be added again in the future.
    * COMPATIBILITY: Removed the Value role for controls and added a value and
      default_value attribute directly to Control. All controls have these and
      current_value() and friends have been updated accordingly.
    * Added the convert_control_to_value() and convert_value_to_control()
      methods, which use the control_to_value and value_to_control attributes as
      well as any features implementing the ControlValueConverter role.
    * Controls now keep a weak reference to the action to which they belong
    * Adding a setup_and_render() method as a shortcut for the common rendering
      tasks
    * Make fill_on_assignment work with default_value, which is better.
    * Now using Test::Able::Runner for tests

0.014   January 16, 2010

    * Added the set_attribute_from_control() helper method to
      Form::Factory::Action
    * Removed the Str type requirements from controls and related classes. This
      causes a lot of complications that Form::Factory just doesn't need to
      worry about. Typing should be handled by the action classes, not the
      controls. The controls should just cope with whatever they are given (at
      least that's the theory I'm operating with for the moment).
    * Updated metadata to include a link to the github repository. (Thanks CPAN
      Service <cpanservice@chorny.com>)
    * Correcting some documentation

0.013   January 4, 2010

    * COMPATIBIILTY: The "no_warn" option to the fill_on_assignment feature is
      now named "no_warning".    
    * Fixed a problem where feature removal was not working correctly when
      using the new has_control +name syntax.

0.012   January 2, 2010

    * Adding support for the has_control '+name' syntax to allow sub-classes to
      override inherited attributes. This allows features to be modified, turned
      on, and turned off in child classes.
    * Prefer carp and croak rather than warn and die
    * Corrected some of the documentation

0.011   January 1, 2010

    * COMPATIBILITY: Break compatability with previous versions in that all
      checks must explicitly set is_valid on the result to affect validation.
      Previously, setting an error automatically flagged something as invalid,
      but this is no longer the case.
    * Updated the built in features to be more consistent with the control value
      refactoring that took place in 0.009
    * Corrected the isa check to a does check on the action attribute of
      features.
    * Added the has_current_value() method to controls with values to determine
      if the control actually contains a value after consumption.
    * The required control feature depends on has_current_value() now
      Gathered results will die if you try to gather itself, does not 
      prevent grandchildren from causing a recursive loop, though
    * Added more tests and test classes are now run in a random order
    * Added the clear_state() method to result classes for clearing success,
      validity, and content attributes
    * Added the use_feature statement to Form::Factory::Processor for adding
      form features to forms
    * Added the require_none_or_all form feature to allow controls to be grouped
      such that one field being filled requires all related fields to be filled
      (such as might be useful on a password change form)

0.010   December 29, 2009

    * COMPATIBILITY: Breaks compatibility with 0.009 in the way the BuildControl
      features work.
    * Changed the API for BuildControl to be more useful
    * Changed fill_on_assignment to update the control on construction
    * Added documentation to BuildControl to explain how it works
    * Added documentation to feature roles to explain how it works

0.009   December 29, 2009

    * Refactored ScalarValue, ListValue, and BooleanValue and added a shared
      Value role. This unifies the values are represented. Some attributes have
      been eliminated and replaced with synonyms so the API has not drastically
      changed. (Though, it is probably not 100% compatible with 0.008.)
    * Updated documentation to better show register_implementation in use
    * Features may not modify attribute construction via the BuildAttribute role
    * Features may now modify control construction via the BuildControl role
    * A new fill_on_assignment control feature has been added
    * Make sure we warn about read-only attributes when is => bare as well as
      when is => ro.

0.008   December 12, 2009

    * It is now possible to extend interfaces, controls, features, and control
      features using your application interface. To do so you need to create a
      Form::Factory::<type>::Custom::<your-name> class which has a
      register_implementation class returning the name of the actual class.

0.007   December 11, 2009

    * Correcting Changes. I must have been half-asleep when I wrote up the
      change log for 0.006
    * Fixing the broken action inheritance test because some objects were sorted
      improperly
    * Adds a test to find a bug related to running the clean() or
      check() or process() method on an action. If the "controls" parameter was
      not passed, it did not work correctly. It worked as if the changes to
      feature roles made in 0.006 had not been done. This has been corrected.

0.006   December 8, 2009

    * The feature role has been split into 5 roles:
        * Form::Factory::Feature is now mostly a marker class for features
          (still adds common attributes, such as result)
        * Form::Factory::Feature::Role::Clean requires the clean method
        * Form::Factory::Feature::Role::Check requires the check method
        * Form::Factory::Feature::Role::PreProcess requires the pre_process
          method
        * Form::Factory::Feature::Role::PostProcess requires the post_process
          method
    * Moved custom message handling for features into separate roles:
      Form::Factory::Feature::Role::CustomMessage and
      Form::Factory::Feature::Role::CustomControlMessage
    * Added a new type of feature, the build_attribute feature allows a control
      feature to modify attributes when the meta-class is being setup
    * Features should now set is_valid() explicitly for success and failure
    * Added more unit tests

0.005   December 6, 2009

    * Make sure get_all_features() in the meta class does not clobber feature
      config when a parent class uses the same feature with a different
      configuration. This might need some more tweaking since we do want to
      avoid running an identical feature multiple times.

0.004   December 3, 2009

    * The render_control() and consume_control() methods now return the control
      object rendered or consumed.
    * The Button control is now a boolean value rather than a preset value to
      make it much more useful
    * The CLI interface does not consume arguments from boolean values anymore,
      it just flips them on or off based on the fact they are present or not
    * Added unit tests for render_control() and consume_control()

0.003   December 3, 2009

    * Adding a consume_control() method to the Action role
    * Correcting a problem with how Form::Factory::Result returns messages when
      in scalar context (it was not stringifying properly before)
    * Adding more unit tests

0.002   November 30, 2009

    * Renamed Form::Factory::Factory to Form::Factory::Interface
    * Adding a CLI interface for developing command-line interfaces
    * Adding several helpful control roles: BooleanValue, HiddenValue,
      MultiLine, and PresetValue
    * Made the ScalarValue and ListValue control roles mutually exclusive
    * Control objects copy the original attribute's documentation attribute

0.001   November 29, 2009

    * Initial release includes the experimental API, basic controls, and a
      factory for rendering and consuming HTML forms
