NAME
    Attribute::Boolean - Mark scalars as pure booleans

VERSION
    Version v1.0.6

SYNOPSYS
    This allows you to flag a variable as a boolean. In numeric context, it
    will have the value 0 or 1. In string context is will have the value
    "false" or "true". In JSON, it will correctly return false or true
    values.

        my $bool : Boolean;
        print $bool;    # "false"
        $bool = (1 + 2 == 3);
        print $bool;    # "true"
        print $bool ? "yes" : "no";  # "yes"
        $bool = false;
        print $bool ? "yes" : "no";  # "no"

EXPORT
    This exports constants true and false.

USAGE
    An attribute can be declared boolean as follows:

        my $bool : Boolean;

    or

        my $bool : Boolean = true;

    If any perl true value is assigned, the variable is true; if a perl
    false value is assigned, the variable is false.

  true
    This returns 1 in numeric context, "true" in string context.

  false
    This returns 0 in numeric context, "false" in string context.

  TO_JSON
    Provided that convert_blessed is set on the JSON (or JSON::XS) object,
    the variable will correctly convert to JSON true or false.

        my $json = new JSON;
        $json->pretty->convert_blessed;
        my $bool : Boolean;
        my %hash = (
            value => $bool,
            me    => true,
        );
        print $json->encode(\%hash);    # {
                                        #     "value" : false,
                                        #     "me"    : true
                                        # }
