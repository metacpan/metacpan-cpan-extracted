Revision history for ProgressMonitor

0.01    2006-11-27
        First version.

0.02	2007-03-20
		Added the setMessage method and associated configuration options for
		the various monitors.

0.03	2007-03-21
        Minor fixes to adjust the tar building (my gnuwin32 tar creates weird
        permissions in the archive).

0.04	2007-03-23
		Replaced wipeAtEnd with atEndStrategy
		Clear any message when ending

0.05	2007-03-27
		Made the Null monitor a singleton
		Made passMessageToParent default to 0 and parentTicks to 1
		Made it allowable to skip calling prepare() and go directly to begin()
		The messageFiller can be blank/undef, causing partial overlay
		Minor help text changes
		messageStart/EndOverlayFields are now 1 based indices.

0.06	2007-04-05
		- Fixed a loophole; if maxwidth not set we must fall back to hardcoded
		  79 unless the Term::Size... stuff returns something worthwhile
		- Added a convenience subMonitor method to the interface; makes it
		  cleaner to instantiate a SubTask monitor
		- Added a setErrorMessage method and associated support
		- Fixed bug where the Bar never indicated empty progress when it was
		  blank
		- Mumbo jumbo with getting stuff printed right when backspacing 
		  before or after - 'backspaceAfterRender'
		  
0.07	2007-04-11
		- Added a clone method to progressmonitors
		- made sure error messages are cleaned from ws
		- set[Error]Message msgs are no longer mangled, but passed right through
		- a msg is passed through as-is if messageStrategy is newline (message filler applied though...should it?)
		
0.08	2007-04-23
		- It's possible to call 'end' directly if no work is needed at all
		  This signals 'completion' of the monitor.
		- Avoid treating a 'begin(0)' the same as 'begin()'
		- Division by zero in some fields when totalTicks is explicitly '0'.
		
0.09	2007-05-09
		- When using an overlay message on a field shorter than the msg, the
		  rendition became longer than its maxwidth
		  
0.10	2007-05-21
		- Removed the setting of ticks == totalTicks at 'end'

0.11	2007-05-25
		- Added a new message strategy - 'overlay_newline'.
		
0.12	2007-05-25
		- When streaming a msg with \n at the end, no need to bs then.

0.20	2007-06-08
		- changing the setMessage API, to enable setting 'delayed' messages
		  i.e. 'set message on next tick' etc.

0.21	2007-06-08
		- the newline message strategy now better handles embedded/trailing \n
		  characters.
		- new strategy 'overlay_honor_newline'
		
0.22	2007-06-11
		- when overlaying a message, make sure to restrict it to field size,
		  except when a newline will be printed

0.23	2007-06-14
		- added the Dynamic field.

0.24	2007-11-09
		- Made end() autocomplete ticks.

0.26	2008-05-21
		- Rendering bs after as default exposed a subtle problem when running
		in putty; after a setErrorMessage (with implicit newlines), bs was
		printed anyway causing output to be overwritten
		
0.27	2008-05-21
		- Silly mistake, bug for 0.26 fixed in file not part of this tree...redone.
		
0.28	2008-08-28
		- Added a way to change the text in a Fixed field.

0.30	2008-08-28
		- Added a way to change the text in a Dynamic field.

0.31	(clearly dropped the ball on this ver, must retrack and see what I did)

0.32	2010-06-11
		Unsure what happened...all versions were removed on CPAN and to be able to
		upload again, I have to bump the version number. No change from 0.31 (which,
		as I mention above has an undocumented change from 0.30).

0.33	2010-06-14
		Bumping to try to get an acceptable format for the PAUSE indexer. No changes.
