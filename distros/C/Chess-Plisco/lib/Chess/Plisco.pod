=head1 NAME 

Chess::Plisco - A comprehensive chess library for Perl

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Chess::Plisco(:all);

    $pos = Chess::Plisco->new;
    $pos = Chess::Plisco->new('k7/8/8/8/8/8/8/7K w - - 0 1');

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<Chess::Plisco> is a comprehensive chess library for Perl, aiming at being
as fast and efficient as possible for a scripting language.  It is also
somewhat opinionated but this is not an end in itself but owed to its intention
of being fast and efficient.  In doubt, flexibility is sacrificed for
performance and efficiency.

The library features:

=over 4

=item bitboards for board representation

=item macros/inline functions for often used computations

=item pseudo-legal move generation

=item legality checks for moves

=item magic bitboards for generation of sliding piece moves and attacks

=item handling of moves in Standard-Algebraic Notation (SAN) as well as
coordinate notation

=item FEN (Forsyth-Edwards Notation) import and export

=item EPD (Extended Position Notation) parser

=item Static Exchange Evaluation (SEE)

=item Zobrist Keys

=back

For a gentler introduction, please see L<Chess::Plisco::Tutorial>.  The rest
of this document contains reference documentation only.

If performance is key for you, you are strongly advised to have a look at
L<Chess::Plisco::Macro> which documents macros resp. inline functions that
speed up tasks that can be done with L<Chess::Plisco> significantly.

The class exports a number of constants that can either be imported
individually, by export tag, or all at once by the export tag ':all'.  All
constants are prefixed with 'CP_' and you will have little reason to not
import all constants.

=head2 Internals

An instance of a B<Chess::Plisco> is a blessed array reference.  You can
access its properties through accessor macros or by using constants for
the array indices.

A move in B<Chess::Plisco> is a regular scalar, more precisely an unsigned
integer. You can access its properties with the move methods described below.

It is guaranteed that every legal chess move is represented by a non-zero
integer.  It is therefore safe to use moves in boolean context.

=head2 Terminology

For the sake of brevity, this document uses the following terms without
further explanation:

=over 4

=item I<Square>

A square is a square of the chess board as a string like "e4" or "f7".

=item I<Coordinates>

Coordinates are a pair of a file (0-7) and a rank (0-7).

=item I<Shift>

A "shift" is an integer in the range of 0-63 where 0 is the shift for "a1" and
63 is the shift for "h8".

=item I<Bitboard>

A bitboard is an unsigned 64-bit integer.  Each bit stands for one square of
the chess board.

=item I<Mask>

A mask is a bitboard with exactly one bit set.  The mask representing "e4" is
a 1 shifted left 28 bits, because the shift for "e4" is 28.

=item I<Move>

When an argument is called "move", it is really an integer representing a chess
move.

=item I<Notation>

When an argument is called "notation", it is a supported notation of a chess
move, either Standard-Algebraic Notation SAN or coordinate notation.

=back

=head2 Limitations

B<Chess::Plisco> requires 64-bit support for Perl.  It will not run on
32-bit Perls.

=head2 Similar Software

L<Chess::Rep> and L<Chess::Play> provide similar functionality.  Both compile
a lot faster than B<Chess::Plisco> but once compiled, a perft test of
B<Chess::Plisco> runs more than 30 times faster than one of L<Chess::Play>
and more than 100 times faster than one of L<Chess::Rep>.

At the time of this writing, B<Chess::Plisco> also outperforms
L<python-chess|https://python-chess.readthedocs.io/en/latest/> by about 50 %.

=head1 CONSTRUCTORS

=over 4

=item B<new([FEN])>

Creates a new B<Chess::Plisco> instance that represents the starting position
of standard chess.

If an argument is passed to the constructor, it is interpreted as a position in
Forsyth-Edwards Notation (FEN).  This has the same effect as using the
constructor C<newFromFEN>.

=item B<newFromFEN(FEN)>

Creates a new B<Chess::Plisco> instance from a string containing the
Forsyth-Edwards Notation (FEN) of a chess position.  The only difference to
C<new()> is that the string argument is required. 

This constructor may throw an exception if the described position does not meet
the requirements of the library.

All legal chess positions meet the requirements of the library.  But positions
that are not legal and may cause the library to malfunction, are rejected.

=item B<copy(POSITION)>

Clones B<POSITION>.

=back

=head1 OVERLOADED OPERATORS

In string context, the position is encoded in Forsyth-Edwards Notation.  No
other operators are overloaded.

Note that the Forsyth-Edwards Notation does not cover all aspects of a chess
position, especially the history of moves.  String-wise equality of two
instances of a B<Chess::Plisco> does therefore not imply that the two
positions are identical.  Use the method L</equal> for a strict equality
check.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 General Methods

=over 4

=item B<toFEN>

Renders the position to Forsyth-Edwards Notation.  Alternatively, you can just
use the object as a string:

    $position = Chess::Plisco->new;
    say $position->toFEN;
    say "$position"; # Does the same as above.

=item B<legalMoves>

Returns a list of legal moves for the current position.  A move is just an
integer.

=item B<pseudoLegalMoves>

Generates all pseudo-legal moves for the current position.

Pseudo-legal are all moves that can be executed by the pieces on the side to
move ignoring whether the side to move is in check after the move.

Only the lower 15 bits of the move are set, that means the start and destination
square, and a possible promotion piece.

If you also need the captured piece and the color, you either have to call
L</legalMoves> or you must use the state information returned from L</doMove>
to retrieve the enriched move.  The first element of the state array is the
enriched move.

=item B<pseudoLegalAttacks>

Like L</pseudoLegalMoves> but only returns "interesting" moves.  Interesting
moves are captures, promotions, and moves directly giving check.  Discovered
checks are not generated.  This has performance reasons.

You will want to call this method for generating moves in a quiescence search.
Since quiescence search is imperfect anyway, it is assumed that ignoring
discovered checks does not have a negative impact.

Future versions of this library may include discovered checks.

=item B<moveNumbers>

Class method that returns an array of all theoretically possible moves in
standard chess.  These move numbers have the following structure:

=over 8

=item B<color (1 bit)>: Either L</CP_BLACK> or L</CP_WHITE>.

=item B<capture (3 bits)>: The captured piece if any, one of L</CP_NONE>,
L</CP_PAWN>, L</CP_KNIGHT>, L</CP_BISHOP>, L</CP_ROOK>, L</CP_QUEEN>,
or (!) L</CP_KING>, see below.

=item B<mover (3 bits)>: The piece that move, one of L</CP_PAWN>, L</CP_KNIGHT>,
L</CP_BISHOP>, L</CP_ROOK>, L</CP_QUEEN>, or <L/CP_KING>.

=item B<promote (3 bits)>: The piece that is promoted to if any, one of
L</CP_KNIGHT>, L</CP_BISHOP>, L</CP_ROOK>, or L</CP_QUEEN>.

=item B<from (6 bits)>: The starting square of the piece as a bit shift.
In case of castling, this is the king's starting square.

=item B<to (6 bits)>: The destination square of the piece as a bit shift.
In case of castling, this is the king's destination square.

=back

If the captured piece is encoded as a king, it is really a pawn that gets
captured en passant.

The size of this array is 45356, see
L<this document at the chess programming wiki|https://www.chessprogramming.org/Encoding_Moves#Over_All_Pieces_and_Squares>.

=item B<equals(POSITION)>

Returns true if the current position is equivalent to B<POSITION>.

=back

=head2 Methods for Accessing Position Properties

=over 4

=item B<whitePieces>

Returns the bitboard of all white pieces.

=item B<blackPieces>

Returns the bitboard of all black pieces.

=item B<occupied>

Returns the bitboard of all squares that are occupied by any piece.

=item B<vacant>

Returns the bitboard of all squares that are not occupied by any piece.

=item B<kings>

Returns the bitboard of all kings (black and white).

=item B<queens>

Returns the bitboard of all queens (black and white).

=item B<rooks>

Returns the bitboard of all rooks (black and white).

=item B<bishops>

Returns the bitboard of all bishops (black and white).

=item B<knights>

Returns the bitboard of all knights (black and white).

=item B<pawns>

Returns the bitboard of all pawns (black and white).

=item B<toMove>

Returns the side to move, either L</CP_BLACK> or L</CP_WHITE>.

=item B<halfMoves>

Returns the number of half-moves made.  Initially, this is 0.  After white has
made their first move, it is 1. After black has made their first move, it is
2, and so on.

=item B<reversibleClock>

Returns the number of reversible moves immediately leading to the current
position.  The following moves are irreversible:

=over 4

=item Pawn moves

Reason: A pawn cannot move backwards.

=item Captures

Reason: Captured pieces are gone for good.

=item First king move of each side

Reason: The side to move loses the castling rights.

=item First move of each rook of each side

Reason: The side to move loses at least one of their castling rights.

=item Castlings

Reason: The side to move loses the castling rights.  This is also implied by
the fact that they are necessarily the first king move.

=back

The half-move-clock is important because both players can claim a draw, when
the half-move clock has reached 50.

=item B<halfMoveClock>

Like L</irreversibleClock> but only captures and pawn moves are considered
irreversible. Changes to the castling state are ignored.  This is the value
that is relevant for claiming a draw according to the 50-move Rule.

=item B<signature>

Returns a 64-bit Zobrist key (aka 64-bit integer) that identifies the position.
Properties taken into account are:

=over 4

=item B<piece positions>

=item B<color to move>

=item B<castling rights>

=item B<en-passant status>

=back

Note that hash collisions albeit unlikely, may occur because 64 bit are, of
course, not sufficient to uniquely identify a chess position.

The signature computed for a certain position is guaranteed not to change for
one release of B<Chess::Plisco>.  In order to compute different signatures,
you have to override either the pseudo-random number generator L</RNG> or its
seed L</CP_RANDOM_SEED>.  If you turn the constant L</CP_RANDOM_SEED> into
a non-constant subroutine, you can also get different signatures, whenever
you re-load the library.

=item B<inCheck>

Returns false if the side to move is not in check, a truthy value otherwise.
The truthy value returned is a bitboard of all pieces giving check.

=item B<evasion>

If the side to move is in check, returns the required check evasion strategy:

=over 4

=item L</CP_EVASION_KING_MOVE>

The king must move.  This is the case, when multiple pieces give check.

=item L</CP_EVASION_CAPTURE>

Either the king must move or the piece giving check must be captured.

=item L</CP_EVASION_ALL>

Either the king must move, the piece giving check must be captured, or another
piece must be moved between the king and the attacking piece.

=back

=item B<evasionSquares>

If a check can be evaded by moving a piece between the king and the attacking
piece of the opponent, this bitboard gives all squares where the check can be
blocked.  These are all squares between the king and the attacking piece,
including the square where the attacker is standing.

=item B<enPassantShift>

If en-passant is possible, returns the shift of the square where the capturing
pawn has to move.  If en-passant is not possible, 0 is returned.  0 happens to
be the shift of "a1" but "a1" is not a valid en-passant square.  It is
therefore safe to use this method in boolean context.

=item B<material>

Gives the material balance from the perspective of the white player.  That
means that all white pieces have a positive value, and all black pieces have
a negative value.

The values are:

=over 4

=item L</CP_QUEEN_VALUE> for each queen

=item L</CP_ROOK_VALUE> for each rook

=item L</CP_BISHOP_VALUE> for each bishop

=item L</CP_KNIGHT_VALUE> for each knight

=item L</CP_PAWN_VALUE> for each pawn

=back

These constants can be overridden by inheriting from B<Chess::Plisco>.

Note: Kings do not count!

=item B<whiteKingSideCastlingRight>

Returns a truthy value if white still has the right to castle king-side
("O-O"), false otherwise.

=item B<whiteQueenSideCastlingRight>

Returns a truthy value if white still has the right to castle queen-side,
("O-O-O"), false otherwise.

=item B<blackKingSideCastlingRight>

Returns a truthy value if black still has the right to castle king-side
("O-O"), false otherwise.

=item B<blackQueenSideCastlingRight>

Returns a truthy value if black still has the right to castle queen-side,
("O-O-O"), false otherwise.

=item B<castlingRights>

Returns a bitmap of castling rights for the current position:

=over 4

=item 0x1 is set if white can still castle king-side

=item 0x2 is set if white can still castle queen-side

=item 0x4 is set if black can still castle king-side

=item 0x8 is set if black can still castle queen-side

=back

=item B<kingShift>

Return the shift of the square of the king of the side to move.  This
information is needed internally.

=item B<info>

Returns an integer encoding various other aspects of the position.  You do not
need this because there are dedicated methods available for all these
properties.

=back

=head2 Move Methods

=over 4

=item B<parseMove(NOTATION)>

Parses the string B<NOTATION> into an integer representing the move or returns
false, if the B<NOTATION> cannot be parsed or is an illegal move.

B<NOTATION> can either be a move in Standard Algebraic Notation (SAN) or in
coordinate notation.  Coordinate notation is the format used by most chess
engines and is the concatenation of the start and destination square and a
possible promotion piece, for example "e2e4" or "f2f1q".

B<IMPORTANT!> Beginning with version 0.5, B<NOTATION> is case-sensitive! This
incompatible change was necessary because a move like "B2d4" may otherwise
be ambiguous.

=item B<SAN(MOVE)>

Renders the integer B<MOVE> into Standard-Algebraic Notation SAN, for example
"e4", "Bxc4", "O-O", or "fxe1=Q".

=item B<moveCoordinateNotation(MOVE)>

Renders the integer B<MOVE> into coordinate notation, for example "e2e4" or
"f2f1q".

=item B<LAN(MOVE)>

Returns the Long Algebraic Notation LAN of the move.  This is an alias for
L</moveCoordinateNotation>.

=item B<moveEquivalent(MOVE1, MOVE2)>

Returns true if the significant parts of B<MOVE1> and B<MOVE2> are equivalent.
This is the case, when the start and destination square, and a possible
promotion piece are equal.

Note that the piece that moves is I<not> significant because it can be
retrieved from the position.  Nevertheless, the piece that moves is set by
the methods L</pseudoLegalMoves> and L</pseudoLegalAttacks> on the moves
returned.  If you store a best move in a transposition table make sure to
keep that in mind, when you compare moves.

Although, this is technically a class method you should keep in mind that 
the redundant parts of the moves depend on the current position.

=item B<moveSignificant(MOVE)>

Returns B<MOVE> with all insignificant bits stripped off.  See
L</moveEquivalent> for what is considered significant.

Although, this is technically a class method you should keep in mind that 
the redundant parts of the moves depend on the current position.

=item B<moveFrom(MOVE)>

Extracts the shift (0-63) of the starting square.

=item B<moveSetFrom(MOVE, FROM)>

Sets the shift (0-63) of the starting square in B<MOVE> to B<FROM> and returns
the move.

=item B<moveTo(MOVE)>

Extracts the shift (0-63) of the destination square.

=item B<moveSetTo(MOVE, TO)>

Sets the shift (0-63) of the destination square in B<MOVE> to B<TO> and returns
the move.

=item B<movePromote(MOVE)>

Extracts the piece that a pawn is promoted to if the move is a promotion.
Returns either L</CP_QUEEN>, L</CP_ROOK>, L</CP_BISHOP>, or L</CP_KNIGHT>.

=item B<moveSetPromote(MOVE, PROMOTE)>

Sets the piece to promote to in B<MOVE> to B<PROMOTE> and returns
the move.  The piece should be one of L</CP_QUEEN>, L</CP_ROOK>, L</CP_BISHOP>,
or L</CP_KNIGHT>.

=item B<movePiece(MOVE)>

Extracts the piece that does the move.  Returns one of L</CP_KING>,
L</CP_QUEEN>, L</CP_ROOK>, L</CP_BISHOP>, L</CP_KNIGHT>, or L</CP_PAWN>.

=item B<moveSetPiece(MOVE, PIECE)>

Sets the piece that moves in B<MOVE> to B<PIECE> and returns
the move.  The piece should be one of L</CP_KING>, L</CP_QUEEN>, L</CP_ROOK>,
L</CP_BISHOP>, L</CP_KNIGHT>, or L</CP_PAWN>.

=item B<moveCaptured(MOVE)>

Extracts the piece that gets captured if any.  Returns one of L</CP_QUEEN>,
L</CP_ROOK>, L</CP_BISHOP>, L</CP_KNIGHT>, L</CP_PAWN>, L</CP_NO_PIECE>.

=item B<moveSetCaptured(MOVE, PIECE)>

Sets the piece that gets captured in B<MOVE> to B<PIECE> and returns
the move.  The piece should be one of L</CP_QUEEN>,
L</CP_ROOK>, L</CP_BISHOP>, L</CP_KNIGHT>, L</CP_PAWN>, L</CP_NO_PIECE>.

=item B<moveColor(MOVE)>

Extracts the color that does the move.

=item B<moveSetColor(MOVE, COLOR)>

Sets the color in B<MOVE> to B<COLOR> and returns the move.

=item B<moveLegal(MOVE|NOTATION)>

Returns a truthy value, when the argument is a valid and legal move.  The move
can be given either as an integer returned by L</parseMove> or as a string
that is accepted by L</parseMove>.

=item B<applyMove(MOVE|NOTATION)>

Parses the move given in B<NOTATION> and applies it to the position if the
move is valid and legal.  Otherwise false is returned.  You can also pass
the move as an integer as returned by L</parseMove>.

The method returns state information that can later be used to undo the move
and reset the position to the state it had before the move was applied.

Engines should use the method L</doMove> instead because it is faster.

=item B<unapplyMove(STATE)>

If B<STATE> is state information returned by L</applyMove>, takes back the
move that was given as an argument to L</applyMove>.

Engines should use the method L</undoMove> instead because it is faster.

=item B<doMove(MOVE)>

Applies the move represented by the integer(!) B<MOVE> to the position.  If
the move is legal, the method returns state information that can be used to
undo the move with L</undoMove>.

The method returns false, if the move is illegal.  Note that this is not a
complete legality check but works only for those moves that
L</pseudoLegalMoves> has returned for the current position.

This method is fast and is the one that should be used by engines.

The state information returned is an array of various bits of information.
The first one is the move itself but the captured piece is set in that
move.

=item B<undoMove(STATE)>

If B<STATE> is state information returned by L</doMove>, takes back the
move that was given as an argument to L</doMove>.

This method is fast and is the one that should be used by engines.

=item B<SEE(MOVE)>

Does a static exchange evaluation SEE for move B<MOVE>.  B<MOVE> B<must> be
a capture, a promotion, a move giving check, or any combination of it.  It
returns the raw material balance expected from the move.

The routine assumes, that after B<MOVE> had been made, all moves that re-capture
on the target field of B<MOVE> will be executed, starting with the least
valuable attacker of each side proceeding to the most valuable attacker.  As
soon as a re-capture becomes disadvantageous, the sequence stops, and the
balance up to that point is returned.

Disadvantageous means that advancing to the "next round" would make the result
worse.  For example a bishop would not normally capture a pawn that is
protected.

If you assign different values to bishops and knights by overriding
L</CP_KNIGHT_VALUE> and L</CP_BISHOP_VALUE> you may receive small values by
this routine, if the exchange of bishops and knights is involved.  Depending
on your preferences you may ignore absolute values under a certain threshold,
for example 100 centipawns.

It should also be noted that the routine assumes that the values of pieces
follows this relation:

pawn E<lt> knight E<lt>= bishop E<lt> rook E<lt> queen (E<lt> king)

=head2 Methods for Converting Locations

=over 4

=item B<squareToShift(SQUARE)>

Converts B<SQUARE> to a shift.

This is a class method.

=item B<squareToCoordinates(SQUARE)>

Converts B<SQUARE> to coordinates.  It returns a list, not a an array reference.
Be sure to call it in array context!

This is a class method.

=item B<shiftToSquare(SHIFT)>

Converts B<SHIFT> to a square.

This is a class method.

=item B<shiftToCoordinates(SHIFT)>

Converts a shift to coordinates.  It returns a list, not a an array reference.
Be sure to call it in array context!

This is a class method.

=item B<coordinatesToSquare(FILE, RANK)>

Converts coordinates to a square.

This is a class method.

=item B<coordinatesToShift(FILE, RANK)>

Converts coordinates to a shift.

This is a class method.

=back

=head2 Methods for Inspecting a Square

The following methods answer the question which piece of which color occupies
a particular location on the chess board.

=over 4

=item B<pieceAtSquare(SQUARE)>

In array context returns a pair of a piece and a color.  In scalar context,
only the piece is returned.  The piece is one of L</CP_PAWN>, L</CP_KNIGHT>,
L</CP_BISHOP>, L</CP_ROOK>, L</CP_QUEEN>, L</CP_KING>, or L</CP_NO_PIECE> if
the square is empty.

The color is one of L</CP_BLACK> or L</CP_WHITE>.  If the square is empty,
C<undef> is returned instead of a color.

This method is relatively expensive!

=item B<pieceAtCoordinates(FILE, RANK)>

In array context returns a pair of a piece and a color.  In scalar context,
only the piece is returned.  The piece is one of L</CP_PAWN>, L</CP_KNIGHT>,
L</CP_BISHOP>, L</CP_ROOK>, L</CP_QUEEN>, L</CP_KING>, or L</CP_NO_PIECE> if
the square is empty.

The color is one of L</CP_BLACK> or L</CP_WHITE>.  If the square is empty,
C<undef> is returned instead of a color.

This method is relatively expensive!

=item B<pieceAtShift(SHIFT)>

In array context returns a pair of a piece and a color.  In scalar context,
only the piece is returned.  The piece is one of L</CP_PAWN>, L</CP_KNIGHT>,
L</CP_BISHOP>, L</CP_ROOK>, L</CP_QUEEN>, L</CP_KING>, or L</CP_NO_PIECE> if
the square is empty.

The color is one of L</CP_BLACK> or L</CP_WHITE>.  If the square is empty,
C<undef> is returned instead of a color.

This method is relatively expensive!

=back

=head2 Analysis Methods

These methods can be used to analyze features of the current position.

=over 4

=item B<insufficientMaterial>

Returns true if none of the two sides has sufficient material to win, false
otherwise.

This is B<not> a general-purpose draw detection but only checks the material
of both sides.  If one side has at least a pawn, rook, or queen, the material
is sufficient to mate.  A mate is also possible when both sides have at least
one minor piece with the exception of king and bishop vs king and bishop.  This
can only be won if the two bishops move on differently colored squares.

One minor piece against a lone king is always a draw.

=item B<attacked(SHIFT)>

Returns true if the square indicated by B<SHIFT> is attacked by a piece of
the opponent.

=item B<moveAttacked(MOVE|NOTATION)>

Returns true if when executing B<MOVE>, the moving piece would be attacked
by a piece of the opponent.  A typical usage example would be to check if
the king moving from B<FROM> to B<TO> would move into check.

You can give the move either as an integer or in one of the supported move
notations.

=item B<movePinned(MOVE|NOTATION)>

Returns true if a piece doing B<MOVE> is pinned.  A piece is pinned if it would
leave the king in check when doing the move.  Exposing other pieces to an
opponent attack is not considered a pin by this method.

You can give the move either as an integer or in one of the supported move
notations.

=item B<rMagic(SHIFT, OCCUPANCY)>

Returns a bitboard of all squares that a rook can reach from B<SHIFT>.
B<OCCUPANCY> is a bitboard of all squares that are occupied by pieces.
The first piece that the sliding piece would reach is considered a potential
captured of a capture and is a valid target square.

See L<Chess::Plisco::Tutorial/Understanding C<rMagic> and C<bMagic>> for
more information.

=item B<bMagic(SHIFT, OCCUPANCY)>

Returns a bitboard of all squares that a bishop can reach from B<SHIFT>.
B<OCCUPANCY> is a bitboard of all squares that are occupied by pieces.
The first piece that the sliding piece would reach is considered a potential
captured of a capture and is a valid target square.

See L<Chess::Plisco::Tutorial/Understanding C<rMagic> and C<bMagic>> for
more information.

=back

=head2 Bit(board) Fiddling Methods

=over 4

=item B<bitboardPopcount(BITBOARD)>

Counts and returns the bits sets in B<BITBOARD>.

This does the same as the builtin function C<__builtin_popcountll> of the C
compilers llvm and gcc.

=item B<bitboardClearLeastSet(BITBOARD)>

Clears the least signicant bit that is set in B<BITBOARD>.

=item B<bitboardClearButLeastSet(BITBOARD)>

Clears all set bits in B<BITBOARD> except for the least significant one that
is set.

=item B<bitboardCountTrailingZbits(BITBOARD)>

Counts all trailing zero bits, that is all bits that are not set starting with
the least significant bit (bit number 0).

=item B<bitboardCountIsolatedTrailingZbits(BITBOARD)>

Counts all trailing zero bits, that is all bits that are not set starting with
the least significant bit (bit number 0).  In other words,
this method gives you the shift of the set bit in B<BITBOARD>.  It only
works if exactlye one bit is set in B<BITBOARD>, otherwise the behavior is
undefined.  

This does the same as the builtin function C<__builtin_ctzll> of the C
compilers llvm and gcc.

=item B<bitboardMoreThanOneSet(BITBOARD)>

Returns a truthy value if more than one bit in B<BITBOARD> is set, false
otherwise.

=back

=head2 Perft Methods

A "perft" (B<PERF>ormance B<T>est) is a standard test for measuring the
performance of the move generator.  Starting from the current position, it
generates all legal moves up to the specified depth.  It is also important for
testing the correct functioning of the move generator because the number of
leave nodes for certain positions are well known.

Internally, each legal move is applied to the position, then the next level
is computed from the resulting position, and finally the move is undone.

=over 4

=item B<perftByCopy(POSITION, DEPTH)>

Does a performance test for position B<POSITION> to depth B<DEPTH>.  Returns
the number of leaf nodes found.

Instead of calling L</undoMove> the moves found are applied to a copy of the
current position that is discarded later.  This is currently slightly faster
than undoing the move programatically with L</undoMove>.

Note that you have to pass a B<Chess::Plisco> instance as the first argument
even when calling it as an instance method! This has performance reason.

=item B<perftByUndo(DEPTH)>

Does a performance test for the current position to depth B<DEPTH>.  Returns
the number of leaf nodes found.

Moves are undone programmatically with L</undoMove>.  This is currently
slightly slower than just copying the position, see L</perftByCopy>.

=item B<perftByCopyWithOutput(DEPTH, FILEHANDLE)>

Does the the same as B<perftByCopy> but prints out all top-level moves found
with the number of subnodes for each move.  The time needed is measured
with L<Time::HiRes/gettimeofday> and reported at the end as well as the
number of nodes found.

This method can be used directly to implement the command "go perft" for a UCI
compatible chess engine.

=item B<perftByUndoWithOutput(DEPTH, FILEHANDLE)>

Does the the same as B<perftByUndo> but prints out all top-level moves found
with the number of subnodes for each move.  The time needed is measured
with L<Time::HiRes/gettimeofday> and reported at the end as well as the
number of nodes found.

This method can be used directly to implement the command "go perft" for a UCI
compatible chess engine.

=over 4

=item B<consistent>

Does an extensive consistency check on the position and throws an exception
if any inconsistency is encountered.

=item B<dumpBitboard(BITBOARD)>

Generate a string representation of B<BITBOARD> in ASCII art.

=item B<dumpAll>

Generates a string representation of all bitboards in ASCII art plus some
additional information.

=item B<dumpInfo(INFO)>

Returns a string with the decoded position information as retured by
L</info>.

=item B<movesCoordinateNotation(MOVES)>

Takes an array of moves (as integers) and converts it into an array of moves
in coordinate notation.

=back

=head2 Other Methods

=over 4

=item B<RNG>

Returns a pseudo-random integer created by the well-known xor-shift
pseudo-random number generator.

The random-number generator is always seeded with the same seed (initial value).
This is on purpose, so that the numbers returned are deterministic.  The
method is currently only used for generating the Zobrist keys for position
signatures.

If you want a different seed, you should override the constant
L</CP_RANDOM_SEED>.

=head1 PROPERTIES

You can access individual properties either by using index constants or by
using accessor macros from L<Chess::Plisco::Macro>.  All accessor macros
can be assigned to; they are L-values.  But you are strongly advised
to modify properties of a B<Chess::Plisco> instance only with the methods
documented here.

For getting or setting the bitboard of all white pieces, you have
these options:

    $whites_pieces = $pos->[CP_W_PIECES];
    $white_pieces = cp_w_pieces $pos;
    $white_pieces = cp_w_pieces($pos);
    $pos->[CP_W_PIECES] = $white_pieces;
    cp_w_pieces $pos = $white_pieces;
    cp_w_pieces($pos) = $white_pieces;

The macros (all starting with "cp_") are only available when you have loaded
L<Chess::Plisco::Macro>, see there for more information.

All elements of the position array are documented below under
L</Accessor Indexes (:accessors)>.

=head1 EXPORT TAGS

The module exports only constants, all prefixed with "CP_".

Note that (lowercase) macros "cp_" are defined by using
L<Chess::Plisco::Macro>.

=head2 All Constants (:all)

You can import all constants with the export tag ":all".

=head2 Accessor Indexes (:accessors)

The array indices were carefully so that the following conditions are met:

=over 4

=item All piece types (L</CP_PAWN>, L</CP_KNIGHT>, ..., L</CP_KING>) can be used as indexes into the instance in order to retrieve their respective bitboard

=item The white bitboard comes directly before the black bitboard.

=back

The bitboard for the pieces of the side to move is therefore always at the
location C<CP_POS_WHITE_PIECES + $pos->toMove>.  Or in other words, the
constants C<CP_POS_PAWNS> and C<CP_PAWN> (likewise for the other piece types)
are guaranteed to be the same and to point to the corresponding piece bitboard.

=over 4

=head3 CP_WHITE =E<gt> 0

Symbolic constant for white pieces, side to move, and so on.

=head3 CP_BLACK =E<gt> 1

Symbolic constant for black pieces, side to move, and so on.  Actually, usage
of this constant is avoided internally so that any truthy value can be used.
Most of the time, this is simply the else branch of a conditional.

=head3 CP_NO_PIECE =E<gt> 0

Symbolic constant for no piece.

=head3 CP_PAWN

Symbolic constant for a pawn.

=head3 CP_KNIGHT

Symbolic constant for a knight.

=head3 CP_BISHOP

Symbolic constant for a bishop.

=head3 CP_ROOK

Symbolic constant for a rook.

=head3 CP_QUEEN

Symbolic constant for a queen.

=head3 CP_KING

Symbolic constant for a king.

=head3 CP_PAWN_VALUE =E<gt> 100

Value of a pawn in centipawns.  Feel free to override this constant in derived
classes.

=head3 CP_KNIGHT_VALUE =E<gt> 300

Value of a knight in centipawns.  Feel free to override this constant in derived
classes.

=head3 CP_BISHOP_VALUE =E<gt> 300

Value of a bishop in centipawns.  Feel free to override this constant in derived
classes.

Note that there is no value for a king.  This is on purpose.

=head3 CP_PIECE_CHARS

An array of arrays that maps numeric piece constants (C<CP_PAWN>, C<CP_KNIGHT>,
...) to characters.  The first array are uppercase letters, normally used
for white pieces, the second one are lowercase letters, normally used for
black pieces.

Example to get the character for a black knight:

    $char = CP_PIECE_CHARS->[CP_BLACK]->[CP_KNIGHT];
