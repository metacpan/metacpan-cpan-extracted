You're more than welcome to improve WWW::GoodData. Here's a couple of 
recommendations that aim to make things easier for anyone if followed.

Thank you for your contributions!

1.) Be consistent.

If you add new code, look for similar things that are already done. This 
applies to conventions, commit messages, documentation as well as coding style.

2.) Don't hack.

Don't hardcode URLs or violate protocols. If you stumble upon a resource that's 
hard to use, or impossible to use properly, let GoodData know that they should 
fix it. If you don't know how, mail support@gooddata.com.

If you still need to do something hacky, add a note to ISSUES file.

3.) Maintain a clear library and shell interface.

If you add functionality, add a library function and possibly a command to 
bin/gdc. Don't add logic to the bin/gdc shell.

Add functionality to shell instead of adding single-purpose scripts to bin/. 
Rationale behind this is to have possibility to do multiple actions within a 
single WWW::GoodData session (such as creating a user and adding a project for 
him).

4.) Ensure there's good documentation.

Follow existing convention on addig POD documentation on everything. There's 
much room for improvement (e.g. adding EXAMPLES sections), don't be afraid to 
modify documentation.

5.) Only use public references.

Only use API with public documentation, code is no replacement for it. 
Everything WWW::GoodData does should be explained here: 
http://docs.gooddata.apiary.io/

Also, no references to non-public bug-tracking or mailing lists or anything 
like that anywhere -- in the code, comments, commit messages.
