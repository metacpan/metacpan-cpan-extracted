See L</new>.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new

Instantiate. The following named parameters may be of use:

=over 4

=item * item_transformations - a coderef or arrayref of transformations to
apply to items received from the adapter.

=item * skip_first - number of items to skip at the start when rendering, default 0

=back

An example of transformations:

 my $bc = Tickit::Widget::Breadcrumb->new(
  item_transformations => sub {
   my $item = shift;
   strftime '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S', localtime $item
  }
 );
 $bc->push([ time ]);

=head2 lines

Returns the number of lines this widget would like.

=head2 cols

Returns the number of columns this widget would like.

=head2 render_to_rb

Perform rendering.

=head2 render_separator

Renders the separator between two items.

Pass the index of the item on the left.

There are 3 cases:

=over 4

=item * inactive to inactive

=item * inactive to active

=item * active to inactive

=back

=head2 transform_item

Applies any transformations to the given item.

Currently these are immediate transformations, i.e. no support for L<Future>s.
This may change in a newer versions, but you should be safe as long as you return
a string or L<String::Tagged> rather than a L<Future> here.

See L<ITEM TRANSFORMATIONS> for details.

=head2 adapter

Returns the adapter responsible for dealing with the underlying data.

If called with no parameters, will return the current adapter (creating one if necessary).

If called with a parameter, will set the adapter to that value,
assigning a new default adapter if given undef. Will then return
$self to allow for method chaining.
