Summary of important user-visible changes for Bio-DB-BioFetch
-------------------------------------------------------------

1.7.3     2019-02-19 13:14:08-05:00 America/Detroit
  * First release after split from bioperl-live.

  * The default baseaddress was changed to use the https protocol.
    The EBI servers were already redirecting it to https anyway.

  * 'refseq' is no longer a valid database for dbfetch requests.  Use
    'refseqn' (RefSeq nucleotide) or 'refseqp' (RefSeq protein)
    instead.
