POSIX-bsearch version 0.02
==========================

POSIX bsearch semantics are provided in scalar context.

In array context, you get the array of contiguous matching list elements
that compare to zero against the provided key.

Comparison function semantics are identical to Perl's sort function, using
$a and $b package variables.

Sets $POSIX::bsearch::index to the index of the first
( wantarray ? indexwise : temporally) found element, or -1 if the key
sorts under the first element, or the array length if it sorts over
the last.
