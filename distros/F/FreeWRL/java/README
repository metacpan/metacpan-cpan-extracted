This is the development ground for the java scripting interface.

If the code is weird and non-idiomatic java, please tell me -- it's
my first java program. No, really, it is. 

genfields.pl generates the files in fields/ subdirectory from 
VRMLFields.pm, making it possible to specify both Const* and * quickly.
