OVERVIEW

    This is a Perl client for the postage API at Easypost
    <https://www.easypost.com/docs/api>. Consider this API at beta quality
    mostly because some of these library calls have an inconsistent input
    parameter interface which I'm not super happy about. Still, there's
    enough here to get meaningful work done, and any future changes will be
    fairly cosmetic.

    Please note! All API errors are fatal via croak. If you need to catch
    errors more gracefully, I recommend using Try::Tiny in your
    implementation.

    API key:

    You must have your API key stored in an environment variable named
    EASYPOST_API_KEY

ATTRIBUTES

 requester

    HTTP client to POST and GET

METHODS

 verify_address

    This method attempts to validate an address. This call expects to take
    the same parameters (in a hashref) or an instance of
    Net::Easypost::Address, namely:

      * street1

      * street2

      * city

      * state

      * zip

      * country

    You may omit some of these attributes like city, state if you supply a
    zip, or zip if you supply a city, state.

    This call returns a new Net::Easypost::Address object.

    Along with the validated address, the phone and name fields will be
    copied from the input parameters, if they're set.

    The verification works only for addresses in US. If you pass a country
    other than US (the default), a warning will be issued, but the
    Net::Easypost::Address object will be returned.

 get_rates

    This method will get postage rates between two zip codes. It takes the
    following input parameters:

      * to => an instance of Net::Easypost::Address

      * from => an instance of Net::Easypost::Address

      * parcel => an instance of Net::Easypost::Parcel

    This call returns an array of Net::Easypost::Rate objects in an
    arbitrary order.

 buy_label

    This method will attempt to purchase postage and generate a shipping
    label.

    It takes as input:

      * A Net::Easypost::Shipment object

      * A Net::Easypost::Rate object

    It returns a Net::Easypost::Label object.

 get_label

    This method retrieves a label from a past purchase. It takes the label
    filename as its only input parameter. It returns a Net::Easypost::Label
    object.

 list_labels

    This method returns an arrayref with all past purchased label
    filenames. It takes no input parameters.
