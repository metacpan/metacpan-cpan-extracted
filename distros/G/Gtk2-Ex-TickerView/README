Gtk2::Ex::TickerView is a horizontal scrolling stock ticker or newsbar
using the Gtk model/view style of Gtk2::TreeView.

    +----------------------------------------------------------+

        <---- scrolling

You supply data in a model such as Gtk2::ListStore or your own custom
model, and TickerView displays the items scrolling across the screen.

CellRenderers allow lots of item styles, including custom drawing.
RtoL mode scrolls right to left, and vertical mode scrolls up and down.

The prerequisites are Gtk2-Perl and my CellLayout-Base, WidgetBits and
ObjectBits helpers.  The TickerView home page is
