NAME
    Games::Mastermind::Cracker - quickly crack Mastermind

VERSION
    Version 0.02 released 01 Dec 07

SYNOPSIS
        use Games::Mastermind::Cracker::Sequential;
        my $cracker = Games::Mastermind::Cracker::Sequential->new();
        printf "The solution is %s!\n", $cracker->cracker;

DESCRIPTION
    Mastermind is a code-breaking game played by two players, the "code
    maker" and the "code breaker".

    This module plays the role of code breaker. The only requirement is that
    you provide the answers to how many black pegs and how many white pegs a
    code gives.

    You must instantiate a subclass of this module to actually break codes.
    There are a number of different cracker modules, described in
    "ALGORITHMS".

    Games::Mastermind is the same game, except it plays the role of code
    maker.

ALGORITHMS
    Here are the algorithms, in roughly increasing order of quality.

  Games::Mastermind::Cracker::Random
    This randomly guesses until it gets the right answer. It does not
    attempt to avoid guessing the same code twice.

  Games::Mastermind::Cracker::Sequential
    This guesses each code in order until it gets the right answer. It uses
    no information from the results to prepare its next guesses.

  Games::Mastermind::Cracker::Basic
    This is the first usable algorithm. It will keep track of all the
    possible codes. When a result is known, it will go through the possible
    codes and eliminate any result inconsistent with the result. For
    example, "BBBB" is not a possible result when "WKYW" is guessed and
    receives a result of 1 black. This is because "WKYW" would not score 1
    black if the correct code is "BBBB".

USAGE
  "new"
    Creates a new Games::Mastermind::Cracker::* object. Note that you MUST
    instantiate a subclass of this module. "new" takes a number of
    arguments:

   "holes"
    The number of holes. Default: 4.

   "pegs"
    The representations of the pegs. Default: 'K', 'B', 'G', 'R', 'Y', 'W'.

   "get_result"
    A coderef to call any time the module wants user input. It passes the
    coderef $self and the string of the guess (e.g. "KRBK") and expects to
    receive two numbers, "black pegs" and "white pegs", as return value. I
    will call this method multiple times if necessary to get sane output, so
    you don't need to do much processing.

    The default queries the user through standard output and standard input.

  "crack"
    The method to call to crack a particular game of Mastermind. This takes
    no arguments. It returns the solution as a string, or "undef" if no
    solution could be found.

  "holes"
    This will return the number of holes used in the game.

  "pegs"
    This will return an array reference of the pegs used in the game.

  "history"
    This will return an array reference of the guesses made so far in the
    game. Each item in "history" is an array refrence itself, containing the
    guess, its black pegs, and its white pegs.

SUBCLASSING
    This module uses Moose so please use it to extend this module. ":)"

    Your cracker should operate such that any update to its internal state
    is caused by "result_of", not "make_guess". This is because your
    "result_of" method may be called (multiple times) before "make_guess" is
    first called.

    If you absolutely have to entangle your guessing and result processing
    code, one way to make this work is to have "result_of" do all the
    calculation and store the next guess to make in an attribute.

  REQUIRED METHODS
   make_guess
    This method will receive no arguments, and expects a string representing
    the guessed code as a result. If your "make_guess" returns "undef", that
    will be interpreted as "unable to crack this code." If your "make_guess"
    returns a scalar reference, that will be interpreted as the correct
    solution.

  OPTIONAL METHODS
   result_of
    This method will receive three arguments: the guess made, the number of
    black pegs, and the number of white pegs. It doesn't have to return
    anything.

  HELPER METHODS
   last_guess
    This returns the last code guessed, or "undef" if no code has been
    guessed yet.

   random_peg
    This returns a peg randomly selected from valid pegs.

   all_codes
    This returns a hash reference of all possible codes. This is not cached
    in any way, so each call is a large speed penalty.

   score
    This expects two codes. It will return the black and white marker count
    as if the first is a guess against the second. (actually, this method is
    associative, so you could say the second against the first ":)").
