0.17  2018-05-27T04:00:03
      - Updated repository details. (MANWAR)
      - Updated link to issues. (MANWAR)
      - Added `contains()` to the list of XPath predicates in the
        documentation, since it's later used in an example. Suggested by Jim
        Keenan (RT #100902).

0.16  2011-11-23T05:24:03
      - Bumped Test::Pod requirement up to 1.41 to support L<text|scheme:...>
        directives. Thanks to Fitz Elliott for the report.

0.15  2011-07-17T02:40:11
      - Require XML::LibXML 1.70, as that seems to be the first version to
        offer `set_option()`.
      - Make sure that HTML::Selector::XPath 0.06 or higher is installed
        before allowing use of CSS selectors. Should fix some test failures
        from cpan-testers.

0.14  2011-06-29T18:31:39
      - The constructor now croaks instead of carping when no XML or HTML
        parameter has been pased to it. Thanks to GitHub user "sshaw" for the
        spot.
      - Added the `find_value()` method to provide easy access to values in
        the document relative to the current node. Suggested by Moritz Onken.
      - XPaths generated via the `css_selector` filter are now properly
        created relative to th current node. That means you can use CSS
        expressions in the recursive block passed to `ok()`.

0.13  2010-06-01T18:39:28
      - Added the `filter` option, which allows custom filtering of XPath
        expressions and the use of CSS selectors instead of XPath expresions.
        Based on a patch from Oliver Charles.
      - Fixed bug that prevented Test::XPath from being subclassable.
        Patch from Michael Schout (with tests, huzzah!).
      - Added support for XML::LibXML options, such as "suppress_errors", that
        aren't set by accessors. Thanks to Michael S. Fischer for the report.
      - Fixed test failures on Windows.

0.12  2009-09-05T23:30:05
      - Added support for PerlX::MethodCallWithBlock.
      - Added Test::HTML::Content to the "See Also" section of the docs.

0.11  2009-09-04T22:16:11
      - Edited the documentation for accuracy, grammar, etc.
      - Added `not_ok()`.
      - Updated minimum Test::More requirement to 0.70. Sometime between 0.64
        and 0.70, the format of diagnostics changed, so older versions make
        Test::XPath tests fail.

0.10  2009-08-31T21:34:37
      - Initial version.
