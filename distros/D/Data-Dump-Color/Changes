0.10     2013-09-10  Released-By: SHARYANTO

         - A couple of fixes for index comment.


0.09     2013-09-10  Released-By: SHARYANTO

         - Remove original Data::Dump documentation. This module's docs now only
           explains what's different from Data::Dump.

         - Add 'require Win32::Console::ANSI' on Windows [suggested by dhorne,
           RT#88560].

         - Better color support (colors for keywords, symbols, array indices,
           and hash keys) and fixes to make output similar again to Data::Dump.
           Internally, I now produce both colored and uncolored dump because the
           Data::Dump code often checks for string width and the colored output
           messes up the calculation (an alternative would be to calculate
           against color-stripped text, but that is probably slower still).

         - Add option to turn off array/hash index comment ($INDEX=0).


0.08     2013-09-10  Released-By: SHARYANTO

         - Fix minor color bug.

         - Rebuild with MakeMaker instead of Module::Build because the latter is
           deprecated in Perl 5.19.

         [ENHANCEMENTS]

         - Add comment to indicate array index or hash pair index (requested by
