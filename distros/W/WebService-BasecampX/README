NAME
    WebService::BasecampX - Perl interface to the bcx Basecamp API

SYNOPSIS
      use WebService::BasecampX;
      my $bc = WebService::BasecampX->new(
          username   => $user,
          password   => $pass,
          account_id => $account
      );
      for my $project ( @{ $bc->projects } ) {
          say join( "\t", $project->{last_event_at}, $project->{name} );
          my $todo_lists = $bc->project_todolists( project => $project->{id} );
          # do something with $todo_lists
      }

DESCRIPTION
    WebService::BasecampX is a client implentation for the bcx Basecamp API

    This module currently only supports the GET methods on the Basecamp API
    but provides 100% coverage for them. Thus, it provides full read-only
    access to the Basecamp API. Creating and modifying things is coming in a
    future release when I get enough tuits.

    Optional and required arguments for the various methods are expected as
    named arguments to the method. See the synopsis call to
    "project_todolists" for example usage.
