OSPF::LSDB
==========

The OSPF::LSDB Perl module and its submodules implement the
functionality to hold, parse, check, display the content of an OSPF
link-state database.

OSPF::LSDB          - hold the content of the OSPF link-state database
OSPF::LSDB::gated   - parse the output from the gated OSPF daemon
OSPF::LSDB::ospfd   - parse the output from the OpenBSD ospf daemon
OSPF::LSDB::ospf6d  - parse the output from the OpenBSD ospf6 daemon
OSPF::LSDB::View    - show the OSPF link-state database as graphviz dot
OSPF::LSDB::View6   - show the OSPF for IPv6 link-state database as dot
OSPF::LSDB::YAML    - load and store the OSPF link-state database as YAML

Additionally the OSPFView package contains command-line tools to
read the link-state database from an ospf daemon.  Then it creates
a dot graphic which can be displayed with graphviz.  At the moment
OpenBSD ospfd and ospf6d and gated 3.6 are supported.  Cisco support
is experimental.

gated2yaml          - convert gated OSPF LSDB to YAML file
ospf2dot            - convert OSPF LSDB YAML to Graphviz dot
ospfconvert         - convert OSPF LSDB file to current version
ospfd2yaml          - convert OpenBSD ospfd or ospf6d lsdb to YAML file
ospfview            - periodically display OSPF LSDB as Graphviz dot xlib
ospfview.cgi        - cgi script to display OSPF graph via web server
