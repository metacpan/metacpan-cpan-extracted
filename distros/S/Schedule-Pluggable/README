DESCRIPTION
       Schedule::Pluggable is a perl module which provides a simple but
       powerful way of running processes in a controlled way.  In true perl
       fashion it makes simple things easy and complicated things possible.
       It also uses a system of plugins so you can change it’s behaviour to
       suit your requirements by supplying your own plugins.  For most cases
       the default plugins will suffice however.

OPTIONS
       You can override the default behaviour of Schedule::Pluggable by
       supplying options with the use statement in for form of a hash

       i.e.

       use Schedule::Pluggable ( Option => "value’ );

       The Following options are supported :−

   JobsConfig
       Specifies which plugin to use to provide the job configuration −
       defaults to JobsFromData which expects you to supply the job
       configuration in an array

       Each plugin is expected to

       e.g.

       use Schedule::Pluggable ( JobsConfig => ’JobsFromSomeWhere’ );

       Currently the available values are :−

       JobsFromArray
           The default which activates the role
           ’Schedule::Pluggable::Plugin::JobsFromData’ which as the name
           suggests expects the job configuration to be be supplied as an
           reference to an array of jobs to run.

       JobsFromXML
           Activates plugin Schedule::Pluggable::Plugin::JobsFromXML which
           obtains the jobs configuration from an XML file
       This enables you to specify a different source for the config by
       supplying an appropriate plugin for it − see writing Plugins for
       details

   EventHandler
       Controls what happens when an event happens like a jobs starting a job
       failing e.t.c Defaults to DefaultEventHandler which is a plugin
       Schedule::Pluggable::Plugin::DefaultEventHandler Here is what is passed
       depending on event type

       JobName     − Always passed
       Command     − Always passed
       Stdout      − Passed on JobStdout and JobSucceeded only
       Stderr      − Passed on JobStderr and JobFailed
       ReturnValue − Passed on JobFailed

       This handler uses other configuration options to control it’s behaviour
       as follows :−

       EventsToReport

       Comma separated list of events to report on or ’all’ for al of them of
       ’none’ for none of them Defaults to
       qq/JobFailed,JobSucceeded,JobStderr/

       e.g.

       use Schedule::Pluggable ( EventsToReport =>
       qw/JobQueued,JobFailed,JobSucceeded,JobStderr/ );

       PrefixWithTimeStamp

       whether to prefix messages with the current time in dd/mm/yyyy
       HH::MM::SS format.

       Defaults to 1 (timestamp is produced)

   MessagesTo
       where messages are sent − stdout by default
       If supplied a filehandle, will call the print method on it and pass the
       details, for anything else will call directly.  So this could be a
       Log::Log4perl method e.g. $log−>info or $log−>{ Category }−>info

   ErrorsTo
       where error messages are sent − stderr by default

       If supplied a filehandle, will call the print method on it and pass the
       details, for anything else will call directly.  So this could be a
       Log::Log4perl method e.g. $log−>error or $log−>{ Category }−>error

       e.g.

       use Schedule::Pluggable ( ErrorsTo => \&my_logger );

       or

       use Schedule::Pluggable; my $p = Schedule::Pluggable−>new( MessagesTo
       => \&my_logger );

JOB CONIFIGURATION FORMAT
       A Job entry can be a scalar value in which case it is assumed to
       contain a command to run or a hash containing some or all of the
       following :−

       name
           the name of the job

       command        − command to run
       params         − array of parameters to the command
       groups         − array of groups to which the job belongs
       prerequisites  − array of jobs or groups which must have completed
       successfully before job with start
       dependencies   − array of jobs or groups which must wait until this job
       has completed successfully before they will start

       Obviously the bare minimum is to supply a command to run If a name is
       not supplied, it will be allocated one in the format Jobn where n is an
       incrementing number starting at 1 and increases with each job specified

METHODS
       run_in_series ( $job_specification )
           Utility method to run the supplied jobs in series by creating
           dependencies where each job is dependant on the previous one and
           then calls run_schedule with the revised definition

       run_in_parallel ( $job_specification )
           Runs the supplied jobs in parallel

           Utility method to run the supplied jobs in parallel by removing and
           dependencies which are defined and the  call run_schedule

       run_schedule ( $job_specification )
           The main method of the module − takes a supplied job definition −
           processes the information to validate and expand the definition and
           then runs the jobs as specified.  When any event occurs, the
           appropriate callback is called if required to report on progress
           and on completion returns a structure detailing what happened in
           the following format :−

           $status = { TotalJobs       => <total number of jobs in schedule>,
                       TotalFailed     => <number of jobs which failed>,
                       TotalFinished   => <number of jobs which finished>,
                       TotalSucceeded’ => <number of successfull jobs>’
                       LastUpdate      => ’dd/mm/yyyy hh::mm::ss’,
                       Failed          => {
                                            <Job which failed> => {
                                                                    status => ....
     BUILDARGS       Handles module options via import or passed on objet
       creation
       BUILD           Handles loading plugins

JOB DEFINITIONS
       Jobs are specified as reference to an array which can contain either a
       list of commands ot run or as hash values

       scalar values containing commands to run
       hashes containing at least one key ’command’ with the value containing
       the command to run
