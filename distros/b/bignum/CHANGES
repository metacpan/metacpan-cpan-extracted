2016-12-13 v0.47 pjacklam

 * Add more logic to Makefile.PL regarding INSTALLDIRS (CPAN RT #119199
   and #119225).

2016-12-11 v0.46 pjacklam

 * Fix Makefile.PL so that this module installs over the core version.

2016-12-03 v0.45 pjacklam

 * Use ExtUtils::MakeMaker rather than Module::Install in Makefile.PL

 * Remove INSTALL file. The information is in the README file.

 * Improve documentation in BUGS and SUPPORT sections in POD in bignum.pm,
   bigint.pm, and bigrat.pm.

 * Remove unused variables in Math/BigInt/Trace.pm and Math/BigFloat/Trace.pm

 * Update README and BUGS files.

 * Remove code that was accidentally left in t/infnan.inc after debugging.

 * Remove author information in LICENSE file.

 * Trim whitespace.

 * CHANGES file now has the same formatting as other Math::BigInt-related
   distributions.

2016-11-15 v0.44 pjacklam

 * Update bundled Module::Install from version 1.16 to version 1.17.

 * Replace function calls with method calls.

 * Include patch for CPAN RT #116506.

2016-07-09 v0.43 pjacklam

 * Replace function calls with method calls.

2016-01-05 v0.42 pjacklam

 * "use strict" and "use warnings" everywhere.

 * Reformat some if the code according to the "perlstyle" man page. It makes
   the code easier for read, for me at least.

 * Add descriptions to tests.

 * Reorder CHANGES to chronological order.

 * Use bpi() as a class method, not a function.

 * Replace "use vars ..." with "our ...".

 * More descriptive variable names.

 * Start POD sections with =pod

 * Allow "nan", "inf", and "infinity", and ingore case, since core Perl allows
   these. We want to be compatible. Add tests to "infnan.inc".

2015-09-25 v0.41 pjacklam

 * hex() and oct() now have the same semantics as the corresponding core
   functions. E.g., hex("cat") returns 202 and a warning "Illegal hexadecimal
   digit 't' ignored at ..." rather than NaN.

2008-04-05 Tels 0.23 301 tests

 * require Math::BigInt v1.88

 * require Math::BigRat v0.21

 * update bundles Module::Install

 * require Perl 5.006 (vs. 5.006002), should work with that

2007-06-30 Tels 0.22 301 tests

 * make the pragmas lexical, so that "no bigint;" etc. works

 * make "use bigint; use bignum;" not warn about redefining "inf" and "NaN"
   This also means a "use bigint;" will not override any already existing
   "inf" or "NaN" routine

 * require Math::BigInt v1.87

 * fix #27059: t/option_l.t fails

 * on Perl 5.9.4 or later: "overload" hex() and oct() with lexical routines
   that also handle arbitrary big integers

 * for all Perls: make "use bigint qw/hex oct/" export global hex() and oct()
   routines that work with big integers

 * make bignum.pm and bigrat.pm re-use code from bigint.pm

 * add exportable bpi() and bexp() methods

 * add exportable PI and e constants
