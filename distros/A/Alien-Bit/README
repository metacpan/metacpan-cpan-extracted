NAME
    Alien::Bit - Find or install the Bit library

VERSION
    version 0.07

SYNOPSIS
    Installs the Bit library, used to manipulate bitsets and their packed
    containers

DESCRIPTION
    This distribution provides the library "Bit" so that it can be used by
    other Perl distributions that are on CPAN. It will download "Bit" from
    Github and will build the (static and dynamic) versions of the library
    for use by other Perl modules.

SEE ALSO
    Bit::Set <https://metacpan.org/pod/Bit::Set>
        This module provides a procedural Perl interface to the C library
        Bit <https://github.com/chrisarg/Bit>, for creating and manipulating
        bitsets. It uses "FFI::Platypus" to wrap the C functions and
        "Alien::Bit" to locate and link to the C library.

    Bit::Set::DB <https://metacpan.org/pod/Bit::Set::DB>
        This module provides a procedural Perl interface to the C library
        "Bit", for creating and manipulating containers of bitsets (BitDB).
        It uses "FFI::Platypus" to wrap the C functions and "Alien::Bit" to
        locate and link to the C library. The main purpose of this library
        is to provide multithreaded and hardware accelerated (e.g. GPU)
        versions of container operations e.g. forming the population count
        of the intersection of two containers of bitsets.

    Bit <https://github.com/chrisarg/Bit>
        Bit is a high-performance, uncompressed bitset implementation in C,
        optimized for modern architectures. The library provides an
        efficient way to create, manipulate, and query bitsets with a focus
        on performance and memory alignment. The API and the interface is
        largely based on David Hanson's Bit_T library discussed in Chapter
        13 of "C Interfaces and Implementations", Addison-Wesley ISBN
        0-201-49841-3 extended to incorporate additional operations (such as
        counts on unions/differences/intersections of sets), fast population
        counts using the libpocnt library and GPU operations for packed
        containers of (collections) of Bit(sets).

    libpopcnt <https://github.com/kimwalisch/libpopcnt>
        libpopcnt.h is a header-only C/C++ library for counting the number
        of 1 bits (bit population count) in an array as quickly as possible
        using specialized CPU instructions i.e. POPCNT, AVX2, AVX512, NEON,
        SVE. libpopcnt.h has been tested successfully using the GCC, Clang
        and MSVC compilers.

    Bit::Fast <https://metacpan.org/pod/Bit::Fast>
        Bit::Fast - A set of fast bit manipulation routines. It provides a
        population count routine in Perl. In platforms with builtin popcount
        routines, it will use them for better performance. Otherwise, it
        uses a tree-of-adders algorithm, that is based entirely on bitmasks
        and shift operations. This is likely to be slower than the Wilks
        Wheeler Gill algorithm in platforms that have fast 64 bit
        multiplication operations.

    Bit::Vector <https://metacpan.org/pod/Bit::Vector>
        Efficient bit vector, set of integers and "big int" math library. It
        is a very complete implementation of a bit vector with a different
        interface than Bit. It provides many more operations that the
        implementation of Bit does.

    Algorithm::BitVector <https://metacpan.org/pod/Algorithm::BitVector>
        A memory efficient packed representation of arbitrary sized bit
        arrays and for logical and arithmetic operations on such arrays.
