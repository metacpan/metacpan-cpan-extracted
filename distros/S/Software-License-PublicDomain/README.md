# WARNING

__You should really think hard before using any other license.__

This "license" is provided for those who want to place their software into the
public domain.  This is the natural result of publishing something to the
world.  Any true license (of which Public Domain is not) is an endorsement of
monopolies and the use of force and coercion to control what other people do
with published information.
