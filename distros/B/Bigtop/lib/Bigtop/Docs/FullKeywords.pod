=head1 NAME

Bigtop::Docs::FullKeywords - Descriptions of all Bigtop keywords

=head1 Intro

This document is generated from C<Bigtop::Docs::Keywords>.  It lists
each supported keyword available in the Bigtop language, just as tentmaker
would, but in POD form.  See the beginning of C<Bigtop::Docs::Syntax>
for a general description of Bigtop source file structure.  See
also C<Bigtop::Docs::TentTut>, which -- like this file -- draws from
C<Bigtop::Keywords>.  You might also find C<Bigtop::Docs::Cookbook> useful.

=head1 Categories

Bigtop keywords come in many categories.  Each subsection below describes
one category.  Here is a brief description of where the keywords
from each categories appear in the Bigtop source file.

=over 4

=item config

These keywords appear in the Bigtop config block that begins each bigtop
file.

This is not to be confused with the app level config block which
appears inside the app block.  There are no defined keywords in the app
config blocks, use whatever conf variable names you like there.  The
same goes for controller level config blocks.

=item app

These keywords appear at the top level of the app block.

=item app_literal

Literals are not blocks and do not have statements like blocks.  They have
this form:

    literal type `whatever string you like`;

where C<literal> introduces the literal and C<type> is one of the
C<app_literal> keywords listed below.  So, for these 'keyword' should
really be called 'type.'

=item controller_literal

Just like app_literals, but appearing inside controller blocks.

=item table

These keywords appear at the top level of table blocks, which in turn
appear at the top level of the app block.

=item join_table

These keywords appear at the top level of join_table blocks, which appear
at top level of the app block.

=item field

These keywords appear in field blocks, which in turn appear inside table
or join_table blocks.

=item controller

These keywords appear in controller blocks, which are at the top level of
the app block.

=item method

These keywords appear in method blocks, which appear inside controller blocks.

=back

Now that you know where the keywords may appear, here they are.  The
categories appear in alphabetical order.  The keywords themselves are
grouped logically (or so it seems to me).  The keyword order within
the category is shared with tentmaker (though tentmaker excludes
keywords which don't apply to the controller or method type).
