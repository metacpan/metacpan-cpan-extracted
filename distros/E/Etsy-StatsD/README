Etsy-StatsD version 1
========================

This is a perl client module to access Etsy's StatsD service, described at
http://codeascraft.etsy.com/2011/02/15/measure-anything-measure-everything/

The CPAN copy should be kept in sync with the version distributed with StatsD,
at https://github.com/etsy/statsd in the exmaples directory,
so you can it from either location.

The client uses an object-oriented interface, so that some expensive
operations, i.e. DNS lookups to resolve the host, and other work to prepare
for the connection, are done by the constructor, to minimize overhead in the
individual methods.
