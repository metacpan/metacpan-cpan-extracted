README for Benchmark::Thread::Size

Find out how different approaches to thread programming work out in size for
different number of threads.

                         *** A note of CAUTION ***

This module only functions on Perl versions 5.8.0 and later.  And then
only when threads are enabled with -Dusethreads.  It is of no use with
any version of Perl before 5.8.0 or without threads enabled.
