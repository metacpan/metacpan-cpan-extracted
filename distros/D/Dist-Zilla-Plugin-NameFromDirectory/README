NAME

    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::NameFromDirectory - Guess distribution name from
    the current directory

SYNOPSIS

      [NameFromDirectory]

DESCRIPTION

    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::NameFromDirectory is a Dist::Zilla plugin to guess
    distribution name (when it's not set in dist.ini) from the current
    working directory.

    Prefixes such as perl- and p5-, as well as the postfix .pm and -pm will
    be automatically trimmed. The following directory names are all
    recognized as Foo-Bar.

      Foo-Bar
      p5-Foo-Bar
      perl-Foo-Bar
      Foo-Bar-pm

    It is designed to be used with Plugin bundle so that your dist.ini
    doesn't need to contain per-project name anymore.

    Even when this plugin is used, you can always override the name by
    specifying it in dist.ini.
