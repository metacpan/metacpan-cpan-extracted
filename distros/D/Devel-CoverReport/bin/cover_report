=head1 SELECTING FILES TO COVER

You may want to decide, how each covered file should be treated.

Unless specified, no file is excluded, all files from Perl's include directories are mentioned, and the rest is included.

=head2 Exclude

Files classified as 'Exclude' will be ignored, as if they never existed.

This is the first check, so file WILL be excluded, even if it could be Mentioned or Selected.

=head2 Mention

Files classified as 'Mention' will be included in the report, in separate list, and will not be taken into account when making statistical summaries.

This feature allows the developer to see what external modules - and which parts of them - his code uses.
Since their (most probably incomplete) coverage is usually not important, they will not make the overall test coverage seem lower, then it actually is.

This is the second test, so the file will be Mentioned, even if could be Selected, as long, as it is not Excluded.

=head2 Include

Files classified as 'Include' will be included in the report, and information about them will be used while making overall statistics.

This is the third check, so file - if matched - will be Selected, unless it was either Excluded or Mentioned.

=head1 FEATURES

=over

=item Per-directory coverage summary

Average coverage, maesured per directory (with sub-directories).
Since Perl packages rely on directory structure, this could provide useful in bigger projects.

Sub-summaries include module, that has the same package name as the directory. 
Some example may describe this better:
 /Foo/Bar.pm
 /Foo/Baz.pm
 /Foo.pm
 /Foo <-- summary, contains /Foo/*.pm and /Foo.pm
 /Bzz/Brr/Doo.pm
 /Bzz.pm
 /Bzz <-- summary, contains /Bzz/Brr/Doo.pm and /Bzz.pm
In the above example, there is not summary for F</Bzz/Bzz>, as it contains just one file,
thus it would not introduce any new infromation, and just double some figures.

=back

=head1 TODO

=over

=item File by test cross summary

Displays table with tests/scripts/sources as columns, and modules as rows.
Intersections show how much ocverage a module receives from the source.

=item Shortening path

When all file paths start with the same prefix, such prefix could be removed to increase redability.

 --basedir_strip       Enable file path shortening
 --nobasedir_strip     Enable file path shortening
 --basedir         dir Set directory, that should be stripped from file paths

=back

=head1 REQUIREMENTS

=over

=item Devel::Cover

This is not always a strict requirement. Since Devel::CoverReport is primary a reporting tool,
You probably need some way of creating the coverage database in the first place.

An example use-case, where You will NOT need having Devel::Cover along, is if You just want
to make report from database, that was generated on another maching/by someone else.

=back

=head1 BUGS

Condition handling is broken - it will I<probably> work on summaries,
but is ultimtely broken on detail pages. Will fix that in next release.

=head1 KNOWN ISSUES

=head2 Paralell runs

I have observed many times, that when running many tests at once can corrupt Devel::Cover database and thus produce false statistics.

Running with C<prove -j 1 ...> (default) should be a safe bet.

=head2 Devel::Cover and Devel::CoverReport reports

It seems, that running 'cover' removes contents of cover_db/runs directory.
Due to this issue, Devel::CoverReport has to be used before running 'cover'.
