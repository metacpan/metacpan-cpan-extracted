FrameNet-WordNet-Detour

VERSION 0.99d

DESCRIPTION

The FrameNet-WordNet-Detour takes one or more synsets as input and
maps each of them to a set of weighted frames.

PREREQUISITS

CPAN-Modules:
- WordNet::QueryData (>= 1.37)
- WordNet::Similarity::path (>=0.10)
- XML::TreeBuilder (>=3.09)
- Getopt::Long (>= 2.34)
- Pod::Usage (>=1.00)
- File::Spec (>=0.86)
- Test::More

Additionally:
- WordNet (needed also for the WordNet::* modules)
- FrameNet (>= 1.1, we tested on 1.1 and 1.2)

INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

With 

    perl Makefile.pl PREFIX=/some/directory

you can target the installation in any directory you want.

The testing code makes use of the two environment variables $FNHOME
and $WNHOME, which should be set to the FrameNet resp. WordNet
directory. The testing code will not work without these variables,
even though it is possible to use the module later on without them.

As a workaround, we propose to temporarly set the variables (or to
skip the tests, but that probably not a good advice ... )
