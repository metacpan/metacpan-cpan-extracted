0.3.1   2018-03-23 (PERLANCAR)

	- Add WordList::Bloom::* to non-wordlist namespace.

	- [dist] Activate DZP:WordList and PWP:WordList.


0.3.0   2018-03-22 (PERLANCAR)

	- Add WordList::Namespace.

        - [spec] each_word() will exit early if code returns -2.

	- [test] Add some tests.

	- [internal] Implement word_exists, pick, and all_words in terms of
          each_word(). Which is a tiny bit slower but more orthogonal and makes
          it easier to change functionality.

	- [doc] Mention that there must not be duplicate entries.


0.2.0   2018-03-19 (PERLANCAR)

          case, require $SORT package variable to be set to some true value.

        - Move back implementation from WordListC (WordListC was an experiment
          and its feature is now incorporated into WordList).
