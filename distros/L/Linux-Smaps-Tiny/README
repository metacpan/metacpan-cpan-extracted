NAME
    Linux::Smaps::Tiny - A minimal and fast alternative to Linux::Smaps

SYNOPSIS
        use Linux::Smaps::Tiny qw(get_smaps_summary);

        my $summary = get_smaps_summary();
        my $size = $summary->{Size};
        my $shared_clean = $summary->{Shared_Clean};
        my $shared_dirty = $summary->{Shared_Dirty};

        print "Size / Clean / Dirty = $size / $shared_clean / $shared_dirty\n";

DESCRIPTION
    This module is a tiny interface to /proc/PID/smaps files. It was written
    because when we rolled out Linux::Smaps in some critical code at a Big
    Internet Company we experienced slowdowns that were solved by writing a
    more minimal version.

    This module will try to use XS code to parse the smaps file, and if that
    doesn't work it'll fall back on a pure-Perl version.

    If something like that isn't your use case you should probably use
    Linux::Smaps instead. Also note that Linux::Smaps itself has been
    optimized
    <http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/perl-modperl/201103.mbox/brows
    er> since this module was initially written.

  SPEED
    The distribution comes with a contrib/benchmark.pl script. As of writing
    this is the speed of Linux::Smaps v.s. Linux::Smaps::Tiny, both the XS
    and PP versions:

FUNCTIONS
  get_smaps_summary
    Takes an optional process id (defaults to "self") returns a summary of
    the smaps data for the given process. Dies if the process does not
    exist.

    Returns a hashref like this:

            {
              'MMUPageSize' => '184',
              'Private_Clean' => '976',
              'Swap' => '0',
              'KernelPageSize' => '184',
              'Pss' => '1755',
              'Private_Dirty' => '772',
              'Referenced' => '2492',
              'Size' => '5456',
              'Shared_Clean' => '744',
              'Shared_Dirty' => '0',
              'Rss' => '2492'
            };

    Values are in kB.
