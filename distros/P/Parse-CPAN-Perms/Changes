      [ENHANCEMENTS]

      - Added a refresh() method that clears the permission hash
      if the file on disk is newer.  New permissions will be
      loaded lazily.

      [BUG FIXES]

      - Fix test failures that resulted from hash randomization
      which started in perl 5.18.  Thanks to ANDK for bringing
      this to my attention.

      [ENHANCEMENTS]

      - The constructor now accepts either a filename or a directory
      as a paramter.  If a directory, it is assumed that the 06perms
      file will be in the usual place within that directory.
