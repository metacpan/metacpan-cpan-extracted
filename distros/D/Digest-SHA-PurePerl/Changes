Revision history for Perl module Digest::SHA::PurePerl.

6.02  Fri Apr 20 16:25:30 MST 2018
	- modified addfile to return error when given a directory name
		-- makes behavior consistent with GNU coreutils shaXsum
		-- thanks to Scott Baker for pointing this out

6.01  Mon Dec 25 00:08:08 MST 2017
	- added "--ignore-missing" and "--strict" options to shasumpp
		-- consistent with GNU coreutils
		-- ref. rt.cpan.org #123897

6.00  Fri Dec  8 22:44:44 MST 2017
	- added "tag" option (BSD-style checksums) to shasumpp
		-- consistent with GNU sha1sum, sha224sum, etc.
		-- thanks to Christopher Tubbs for suggestion
	- decoupled Digest::SHA::PurePerl and Digest::SHA
		-- scripts/tests in each module now fully independent
		-- Digest::SHA::PurePerl to be phased out eventually
			-- past versions will remain available

5.98  Wed Oct  4 00:40:02 MST 2017
	- Digest::SHA::PurePerl now has its own shasum
		-- renamed to shasumpp
		-- depends explicitly on Digest::SHA::PurePerl
		-- no longer makes use of Digest::SHA if present
			-- hence no need for -R option
	- removed "portable" mode from shasumpp and addfile
		-- rarely used, mostly in outdated systems
		-- potentially confusing features (e.g. \r\r\n -> \n)
		-- Universal Newlines mode (-U) a much cleaner approach
			-- mimics Universal Newlines in Python
