Sys::Info::Driver::BSD
======================

BSD driver for Sys::Info.

Read the module's POD for documentation.
See the tests for examples.

INSTALLATION

Don't try to install this module directly. Install the Sys::Info module instead,
which'll fetch this module as well.

Just use the cpan shell to install this module. From a command prompt, type:

    cpan

or

    perl -MCPAN -e shell

to enter the cpan shell. And then enter:

   install Sys::Info

If you don't have the cpan shell available, then you have a broken perl
installation.
