=head1 NAME

Fl::RepeatButton - Button that Reapeats Callback when Held

=head1 Synopsis

    use Fl;
    my $adj = Fl::Adjuster->new(0, 0, 100, 200, 'Hello, World!');

=head1 Description

The Fl::Adjuster class represents a widget for large dynamic ranges.

=for html <center><img src="http://www.fltk.org/doc-1.3/adjuster1.png" /></center>

When you press a button and drag to the right the value increases. When you
drag to the left it decreases. The largest button adjusts by 100 * step(),
the next by 10 * step() and that smallest button by step(). Clicking on the
buttons increments by 10 times the amount dragging by a pixel does. Shift +
click decrements by 10 times the amount.

=head1 Methods

Fl::Adjuster inherits from Fl::Valuator which in turns inherits from
Fl::Widget. On top of that, it exposes the following methods...

=head2 new(...)

    my $adj_a = Fl::Adjuster->new(0, 0, 250, 500, 'Important Stuff');
    my $adj_b = Fl::Adjuster->new(0, 0, 250, 500);

The constructor creates a new widget using the given position, size, and
label. It looks best if one of the dimensions is 3 times the other.

The destructor removes the widget.

             optional => [['const char *', 'label', '""']],
             returns  => 'Fl_Adjuster *'
            }

    ]
};

=head2 soft(...)

    my $adj_a->soft( 1 );
    my soft = $adj_b->soft( );

If "soft" is turned on, the user is allowed to drag the value outside the
range.

If they drag the value to one of the ends, let go, then grab again and
continue to drag, they can get to any value. Default is on (1).

    ]
