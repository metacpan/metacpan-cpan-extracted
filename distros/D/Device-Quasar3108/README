Device-Quasar3108 version 0.01
==============================

Device::Quasar3108 is a perl module for controlling 
Quasar Electronics Serial Isolated I/O module (kit number 3108).
The kit has eight relays and four opto-isolated inputs.

It seems very similar (identical?) to Carl's Electronic Kits 
number CK1610:

The perl module was tested on Debian Linux 3.1, but should work on 
most POSIX systems.

	To install this module type the following:

		perl Build.PL

	And then as root:
