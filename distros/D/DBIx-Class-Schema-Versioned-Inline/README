DESCRIPTION
    This module extends DBIx::Class::Schema::Versioned using simple 'since'
    and 'until' tokens within result classes to specify the schema version
    at which classes and columns were introduced or removed. Column
    since/until definitions are included as part of 'versioned' info in
    add_column(s).

  since
    When a class is added to a schema at a specific schema version version
    then a 'since' attribute must be added to the class which returns the
    version at which the class was added. For example:

     __PACKAGE__->resultset_attributes({ versioned => { since => '0.002' }});

    It is not necessary to add this to the initial version of a class since
    any class without this atribute is assumed to have existed for ever.

    Using 'since' in a column or relationship definition denotes the version
    at which the column/relation was added. For example:

     __PACKAGE__->add_column(
        "age" => {
            data_type => "integer", is_nullable => 1,
            versioned => { since => '0.002' }
        }
     );

    For changes to column_info such as a change of data_type see "changes".

    Note: if the Result containing the column includes a class-level "since"
    then there is no need to add "since" markers for columns created at the
    same version.

    Relationships are handled in the same way as columns:

     __PACKAGE__->belongs_to(
        'bar',
        'MyApp::Schema::Result::Bar',
        'bars_id',
        { versioned => { since => '0.002' } },
     );

  until
    When used as a class attribute this should be the schema version at
    which the class is to be removed. The underlying database table will be
    removed when the schema is upgraded to this version. Example
    definitions:

     __PACKAGE__->resultset_attributes({ versioned => { until => '0.7' }});

     __PACKAGE__->add_column(
        "age" => {
            data_type => "integer", is_nullable => 1,
            versioned => { until => '0.5' }
        }
     );

    Using 'until' in a column or relationship definition will cause removal
    of the column/relation from the table when the schema is upgraded to
    this version.

  renamed_from
    This is always used alongside 'since' in the renamed class/column and
    there must also be a corresponding 'until' on the old class/column.

    NOTE: when renaming a class the 'renamed_from' value is the table name
    of the old class and NOT the class name.

    For example when renaming a class:

     package MyApp::Schema::Result::Foo;

     __PACKAGE__->table('foos');
     __PACKAGE__->resultset_attributes({ versioned => { until => '0.5 }});

     package MyApp::Schema::Result::Fooey;

     __PACKAGE__->table('fooeys');
     __PACKAGE__->resultset_attributes({
        versioned => { since => '0.5, renamed_from => 'foos' }
     });

    And when renaming a column:

     __PACKAGE__->add_columns(
        "height" => {
            data_type => "integer",
            versioned => { until => '0.002' }
        },
        "width" => {
            data_type => "integer", is_nullable => 0,
            versioned => { since => '0.002', renamed_from => 'height' }
        },
     );

    As can been seen in the example it is possible to modify column
    definitions at the same time as a rename but care should be taken to
    ensure that any data modification (such as ensuring there are no longer
    null values when is_nullable => 0 is introduced) must be handled via
    "Upgrade.pm".

    NOTE: if columns are renamed at the same version that a class/table is
    renamed (for example a renamed PK) then you MUST also add "renamed_from"
    to the column as otherwise data from that column will be lost. In this
    special situation adding "since" to the column is not required.

  changes
    Column definition changes are handled using the "changes" token. A
    hashref is created for each version where the column definition changes
    which details the new column definition in effect from that change
    revision. For example:

     __PACKAGE__->add_columns(
        "item_weight",
        {
            data_type => "integer", is_nullable => 1, default_value => 4,
            versioned => { until => '0.001 },
        },
        "weight",
        {
            data_type => "integer", is_nullable => 1,
            versioned => {
                since        => '0.002',
                renamed_from => 'item_weight',
                changes => {
                    '0.4' => {
                        data_type   => "numeric",
                        size        => [10,2],
                        is_nullable => 1,
                    }
                    '0.401' => {
                        data_type   => "numeric",
                        size        => [10,2],
                        is_nullable => 0,
                        default_value => "0.0",
                    }
                }
            }
        }
     );

    Note: the initial column definition should never be changed since that
    is the definition to be used from when the column is first created until
    the first change is effected.

  Upgrade.pm
    For details on how to apply data modifications that might be required
    during an upgrade see DBIx::Class::Schema::Versioned::Inline::Upgrade.

VERSION NUMBERS
    Under the hood all version numbers are handled using Perl::Version which
    can lead to confusion if you do not understand how Perl versions are
    manipulated. For example:

      $a = Perl::Version->new(0.4)
      $b = Perl::Version->new(0.3)
      $a > $b                           # TRUE

    But things can start to look very odd as soon as we use different
    numbers of decimal places:

      $a = Perl::Version->new(0.12)
      $b = Perl::Version->new(0.30)
      $a > $b                           # TRUE

    And just to add to potential confusion:

      $a = Perl::Version->new(0.12)
      $b = Perl::Version->new("0.30")
      $a > $b                           # FALSE

    The motto of this story is that you must be careful how you manage your
    versions. Please read Perl::Version pod carefully and make sure you
    understand how it operates. To avoid unexpected behaviour it is
    recommended that you always quote the version and if possible use a
    dotted-decimal with at least three components or use simple cardinal
    numbers which can never be confused.

ATTRIBUTES
  schema_versions
    A Set::Equivalence set of PerVersion objects containing all of the
    available schema versions.

    Versions should be added using "add_version".

METHODS
    Many methods are inherited or overloaded from
    DBIx::Class::Schema::Versioned.

  add_version( $version [, $v2, ... ] )
    Adds one or more versions to "schema_versions" set. Arguments can either
    be PerlVersion objects or simple scalars which will be coerced into
    such.

  connection
    Overloaded method. This checks the DBIC schema version against the DB
    version and uses the DB version if it exists or the schema version if
    the database is currently unversioned.

  deploy
    Inherited method. Same as "deploy" in DBIx::Class::Schema but also calls
    "install".

  downgrade
    Call this to attempt to downgrade your database from the version it is
    at to the version this DBIC schema is at. If they are the same it does
    nothing.

  downgrade_single_step
  install
    Inherited method. Call this to initialise a previously unversioned
    database.

  get_db_version
    Override "get_db_version" in DBIx::Class::Schema::Versioned to return
    the version as a PerlVersion object.

  ordered_schema_versions
      $self->ordered_schema_version('desc');

    Optional argument defines the order (ascending or descending). With no
    arg (or an arg we cannot determine direction from) results in ascending.

  schema_first_version
    Returns the current schema class' $FIRST_VERSION in a normalised way.

    If the schema does not define $FIRST_VERSION then all resultsets must
    specify the version at which they were added using "since".

  schema_version
    Override "schema_version" in DBIx::Class::Schema to return the version
    as a PerlVersion object.

  stringified_ordered_schema_versions
    Calls "ordered_schema_versions" with the same args and converts the
    returned list elements to stringified versions.

  upgrade
    Inherited method. Call this to attempt to upgrade your database from the
    version it is at to the version this DBIC schema is at. If they are the
    same it does nothing.

  upgrade_single_step
    Arguments: db_version - the version currently within the db
    Arguments: target_version - the version to upgrade to

    Overloaded method. Call this to attempt to upgrade your database from
    the *db_version* to the *target_version*. If they are the same it does
    nothing.

    All upgrade operations within this step are performed inside a single
    transaction so either all succeed or all fail. If successful the
    dbix_class_schema_versions table is updated with the *target_version*.

    This method may be called repeatedly by the "upgrade" method to upgrade
    through a series of updates.

  versioned_schema
    Arguments: version - the schema version we want to deploy

    Parse schema and remove classes, columns and relationships that are not
    valid for the requested version.

CANDY
    See DBIx::Class::Schema::Versioned::Inline::Candy.
