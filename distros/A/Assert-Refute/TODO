{priority} {complexity} {TAG} {brief feature/bug description}

# *Priority* _decreases_ from `+` to `+++`

The questions to ask oneself:

* Can 1.0 ship without this?
* Is not having this done awkward?
* Are there users asking for this?
* Do other features depend on this?

# *Complexity* _increases_ from `+` to `+++`

The questions to ask oneself:

* What is the simplest meaningful example?
* How should this be tested/documented?
* What extra knowledge is required for this?
* What other features does this depend upon?

# *Tag* is 3 uppercase letters

Known tags are (also used in commit messages):

* **API** - extending API
* **MOD** - condition/check arsenal
* **DRV** - test backends/drivers
* **BLD** - own builder features/bugs
* **REF** - refactoring, internal structure changes, optimisations
* **DOC** - improving documentation, use case descriptions
* **TST** - adding tests/examples
* **BUG** - bugfix
* **AUX** - changing distribution files (Makefile, README, xt tests etc)
