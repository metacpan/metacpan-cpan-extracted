Test-StubGenerator

Test::StubGenerator - A simple module that analyzes a given source file and
automatically generates t/*.t style tests for subroutines/methods
it encounters.

Test::StubGenerator does a fair job of analyzing a given source file and
automatically creating testing stubs suitable for unit testing your module.

Test::StubGenerator make use of PPI in order to parse your module, looking for
constructors and methods for modules (.pm), and subroutines for Perl script
files (.pl).

Test::StubGenerator also optionally runs the generated tests through
Perl::Tidy before returning the text of the tests to you.

Test::StubGenerator grew out of a vim plugin that created test stub files in
a very similar fashion.  However, the line-based nature of vimscript quickly
indicated that adding default parameters to the tests would prove to be
an exercise in futility.  As this was a feature I very much wanted to implement,
I naturally turned to Perl, and PPI.
