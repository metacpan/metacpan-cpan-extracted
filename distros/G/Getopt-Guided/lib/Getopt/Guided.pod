=head1 NAME

Getopt::Guided - getopts implementation that follows POSIX utility guidelines

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Getopt::Guided qw( getopts );

  local @ARGV = qw( -d dv1 -c -v -a av1 -d dv2 -a av2 -d -- -vv v1 v2 );
  getopts 'a:bcd,v', my %opts;

  # %opts == ( a => 'av2', c => 1, d => [ 'dv1', 'dv2', '--' ], v => 3 )
  # @ARGV == ( 'v1', 'v2' )

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module reimplements the C<getopts()> function of the L<Getopts::Std>
core module.  The new implementation supports only the two-parameter form
of C<getopts()>.  The first parameter is a string that contains the option
characters (the options specification).  The second parameter is an empty
hash (passed by reference) that stores the processing result. Each hash
key refers to a provided option character and the corresponding hash value
refers to the option-argument (or C<1> if it is a flag). This module exports
the C<getopts()> function on request.

The new implementation follows the L<POSIX utility syntax
guidelines|https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9799919799/basedefs/V1_chap12.html#tag_12_02>
4 to 10, inclusive. C<getopts()> warns and returns false if a processing error
occurs; otherwise the function returns true. The processing error types are:

=over 2

=item 1. illegal option

=item 2. option requires an argument

=item 3. option with argument isn't last one in group

=back

The second processing error occurs if either no argument or the C<undef>
value is provided for an option that requires an option-argument.

If any of the processing errors occurs, C<getopts()> restores C<@ARGV>
before it warns and returns false.

=head1 OPTION TYPES

An option that requires no option-argument is called a flag. If a flag
is provided, its hash value is C<1>, which in perl boolean context means
true. If the same flag is provided multiple times, the implementation could
keep the hash value. But for perl each positive integer is true in boolean
context. Therefore each occurrence of the flag increments its hash value
by one.  For example, this is useful for incrementing a verbosity level
represented by the C<-v> flag.

An option that requires an option-argument has either a colon (C<:>) or a
comma (C<,>) option-argument indicator. The indicator follows the option
character in the options specification (C<getopts()>'s first parameter).

If a C<:> option is repeated, the option-arguments overwrite each other and
the last argument wins that means it is assigned as a value to the option
character key in C<%opts>.

If a C<,> option is repeated, the option-arguments are pushed to an array.
A reference to that array is assigned as a value to the option character
key in C<%opts>.

=head1 CAVEAT

Even if you are currently using the two-parameter form of the C<getopts()>
function of C<Getopts::Std>, the new implementation isn't a drop in
replacement.
