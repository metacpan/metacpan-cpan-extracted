0.009     2015-09-11
        - DB tuning/tweaking:
          * avoid deadlocks due to gap locking
          * fix missing finish_transaction
          * be crisp about UNSIGNED and use BLOB for raw queue
          * simplify resetting of AutoCommit mode

0.008     2015-09-08
        - enable transactions for garbage collector

0.007     2015-09-08
        - queuing mode for high-throughput incoming results
          * part 1) adds raw results into separate table
          * part 2) process one of those values,
                    likely called in bundles or from multiple workers
          * part 3) garbage collect successfully processed results

0.006     2015-08-26
        - disable caching due to wrong behaviour

0.005     2015-08-24
        - larger field sizes
        - select_benchmark_point_essentials()
          Get NAME, VALUE, UNIT of a single benchmark point
        - select_complete_benchmark_point()
          Get all additional key/value fields of a single benchmark point
        - get_single_benchmark_point()
          Reconstruct a complete single benchmark point

0.004     2015-08-20

0.003     2015-08-18
        - handling of duplicates and undefined values

0.002     2015-08-17
        - store benchmark VALUEs as VARCHAR to avoid rounding
          and allow non-number values en passant
        - dependency++ to DBD::SQLite 1.48 to avoid error
          'no such column: bav2.bench_additional_value"

        - Initial release - CPAN DAY - 2015-08-16
        - based on the released code from early 2014
        - This is a library to provide a schema for
          storing benchmark values in an SQL database
        - Primarily targets mysql, SQLite support
          is basically so far by cutting away known
          trouble maker SQL statement parts
        - Read more about the schema on http://benchmarkanything.org/
