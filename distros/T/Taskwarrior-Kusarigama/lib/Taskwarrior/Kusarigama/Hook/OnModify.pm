Role consumed by plugins running during the task modification stage of
the Taskwarrior hook lifecycle. 

Requires that a C<on_modify> is implemented.

The C<on_modify> method, when invoked, will be
given the new version of the task, the previous version,
and the delta as calculated by 
L<Hash::Diff>'s c<diff> function.

    sub on_modify {
        my( $self, $new_task, $old_task, $diff ) = @_;

        ...
    }
