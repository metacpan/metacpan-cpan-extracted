=head1 NAME

Lucy::Search::ANDQuery - Intersect multiple result sets.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $foo_and_bar_query = Lucy::Search::ANDQuery->new(
        children => [ $foo_query, $bar_query ],
    );
    my $hits = $searcher->hits( query => $foo_and_bar_query );
    ...

=head1 DESCRIPTION

ANDQuery is a composite L<Query|Lucy::Search::Query> which matches
only when all of its children match, so its result set is the intersection
of their result sets.  Documents which match receive a summed score.

=head1 CONSTRUCTORS

=head2 new

    my $foo_and_bar_query = Lucy::Search::ANDQuery->new(
        children => [ $foo_query, $bar_query ],
    );

Create a new ANDQuery.

=over

=item *

B<children> - An array of child Queries.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 make_compiler

    my $compiler = $and_query->make_compiler(
        searcher    => $searcher,     # required
        boost       => $boost,        # required
        subordinate => $subordinate,  # default: false
    );

Abstract factory method returning a Compiler derived from this Query.

=over

=item *

B<searcher> - A Searcher.

=item *

B<boost> - A scoring multiplier.

=item *

B<subordinate> - Indicates whether the Query is a subquery (as
opposed to a top-level query).  If false, the implementation must
invoke L<normalize()|Lucy::Search::Compiler/normalize> on the newly minted Compiler object before returning
it.

=head1 INHERITANCE

Lucy::Search::ANDQuery isa L<Lucy::Search::PolyQuery> isa L<Lucy::Search::Query> isa Clownfish::Obj.
