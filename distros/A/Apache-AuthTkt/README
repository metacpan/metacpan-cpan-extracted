Apache::AuthTkt
==================

Apache::AuthTkt is a perl module used to generate and validate 
authentication tickets used with the 'mod_auth_tkt' apache 
authentication module. mod_auth_tkt is a lightweight cookie-based 
authentication module written in C that is user repository agnostic 
(i.e. not tied to ldap/pam/radius etc.), and supports single-signon 
across multiple apaches and machines. 

See http://www.openfusion.com.au/labs/mod_auth_tkt/ for details, 
and the Apache::AuthTkt perldocs.
