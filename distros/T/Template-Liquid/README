NAME
    Template::Liquid - A Simple, Stateless Template System

Synopsis
        use Template::Liquid;
        my $template = Template::Liquid->parse(
            '{% for x in (1..3) reversed %}{{ x }}, {% endfor %}{{ some.text }}');
        print $template->render(some => {text => 'Contact!'}); # 3, 2, 1, Contact!

Description
    The original Liquid template engine was crafted for very specific
    requirements:

    *   It has to have simple markup and beautiful results.

        Template engines which don't produce good looking results are no fun
        to use.

    *   It needs to be non-evaling and secure.

        Liquid templates are made so that users can edit them. You don't
        want to run code on your server which your users wrote.

    *   It has to be stateless.

        The compile and render steps have to be separate so the expensive
        parsing and compiling can be done once; later on, you can just
        render it by passing in a hash with local variables and objects.

    *   It needs to be able to style email as well as HTML.

Getting Started
    It's very simple to get started. Templates are built and used in two
    steps: Parse and Render.

    If you're in a hurry, you could just...

        use Template::Liquid;
        print Template::Liquid->parse('Hi, {{name}}!')->render(name => 'Sanko');

    But because Liquid is stateless, you can split that part. Keep reading.

  Parse
        use Template::Liquid;
        my $sol = Template::Liquid->new();    # Create a Template::Liquid object
        $sol->parse('Hi, {{name}}!');         # Parse and compile the template

    ...or...

        use Template::Liquid;
        my $sol = Template::Liquid->parse('Hi, {{name}}!'); # Obj is auto-created

    The "parse" step creates a fully compiled template which can be re-used
    as often as you like. You can store it in memory or in a cache for
    faster rendering later. Templates are simple, blessed references so you
    could do...

        use Template::Liquid;
        use Data::Dump qw[pp];
        my $greet = Template::Liquid->parse('Hi, {{name}}!');
        my $dump = pp($greet);

    ...store $dump somewhere (a file, database, etc.) and then eval the
    structure later without doing the 'expensive' parsing step again.

  Render
    To complete our $sol examples from the previous section, rendering a
    template is as easy as...

        $sol->render(name => 'Sanko');    # Returns 'Hi, Sanko!'
        $sol->render(name => 'Megatron'); # Returns 'Hi, Megatron!'

    All parameters you want Template::Liquid to work with must be passed to
    the "render" method. Template::Liquid is a closed ecosystem; it does not
    know about your local, instance, global, or environment variables. If
    your template requires any of those, you must pass them along:

        use Template::Liquid;
        print Template::Liquid->parse(
                                  '@INC: {%for item in inc%}{{item}}, {%endfor%}')
            ->render(inc => \@INC);

Standard Liquid Tags
    Expanding the list of supported tags is easy but here's the current
    standard set:

  "comment"
    Comment tags are simple blocks that do nothing during the render stage.
    Use these to temporarily disable blocks of code or to insert
    documentation.

        This is a {% comment %} secret {% endcomment %}line of text.

    ...renders to...

        This is a line of text.

    For more, see Template::Liquid::Tag::Comment.

  "raw"
    Raw temporarily disables tag processing. This is useful for generating
    content (eg, Mustache, Handlebars) which uses conflicting syntax.

        {% raw %}
            In Handlebars, {{ this }} will be HTML-escaped, but {{{ that }}} will not.
        {% endraw %}

    ...renders to...

        In Handlebars, {{ this }} will be HTML-escaped, but {{{ that }}} will not.

    For more, see Template::Liquid::Tag::Raw.

  "if" / "elseif" / "else"
        {% if post.body contains search_string %}
            <div class="post result" id="p-{{post.id}}">
                <p class="title">{{ post.title }}</p>
                ...
            </div>
        {% endunless %}

    For more, see Template::Liquid::Tag::If and Template::Liquid::Condition.
    .

  "unless" / "elseif" / "else"
    This is sorta the opposite of "if".

        {% unless some.value == 3 %}
            Well, the value sure ain't three.
        {% elseif some.value > 1 %}
            It's greater than one.
        {% else %}
           Well, is greater than one but not equal to three.
           Psst! It's {{some.value}}.
        {% endunless %}

    For more, see Template::Liquid::Tag::Unless and
    Template::Liquid::Condition.

  "case"
    If you need more conditions, you can use the case statement:

        {% case condition %}
            {% when 1 %}
                hit 1
            {% when 2 or 3 %}
                hit 2 or 3
            {% else %}
                ... else ...
        {% endcase %}

    For more, see Template::Liquid::Tag::Case.

  "cycle"
    Often you have to alternate between different colors or similar tasks.
    Liquid has built-in support for such operations, using the cycle tag.

        {% cycle 'one', 'two', 'three' %}
        {% cycle 'one', 'two', 'three' %}
        {% cycle 'one', 'two', 'three' %}
        {% cycle 'one', 'two', 'three' %}

    ...will result in...

        one
        two
        three
        one

    If no name is supplied for the cycle group, then it's assumed that
    multiple calls with the same parameters are one group.

    If you want to have total control over cycle groups, you can optionally
    specify the name of the group. This can even be a variable.

        {% cycle 'group 1': 'one', 'two', 'three' %}
        {% cycle 'group 1': 'one', 'two', 'three' %}
        {% cycle 'group 2': 'one', 'two', 'three' %}
        {% cycle 'group 2': 'one', 'two', 'three' %}

    ...will result in...

        one
        two
        one
        two

    For more, see Template::Liquid::Tag::Cycle.

  "for"
    Liquid allows for loops over collections:

        {% for item in array %}
            {{ item }}
        {% endfor %}

    Please see see Template::Liquid::Tag::For.

  "assign"
    You can store data in your own variables, to be used in output or other
    tags as desired. The simplest way to create a variable is with the
    assign tag, which has a pretty straightforward syntax:

        {% assign name = 'freestyle' %}

        {% for t in collections.tags %}{% if t == name %}
            <p>Freestyle!</p>
        {% endif %}{% endfor %}

    Another way of doing this would be to assign true / false values to the
    variable:

        {% assign freestyle = false %}

        {% for t in collections.tags %}{% if t == 'freestyle' %}
            {% assign freestyle = true %}
        {% endif %}{% endfor %}

        {% if freestyle %}
            <p>Freestyle!</p>
        {% endif %}

    If you want to combine a number of strings into a single string and save
    it to a variable, you can do that with the capture tag.

    For more, see Template::Liquid::Tag::Assign.

  "capture"
    This tag is a block which "captures" whatever is rendered inside it,
    then assigns the captured value to the given variable instead of
    rendering it to the screen.

        {% capture attribute_name %}{{ item.title | handleize }}-{{ i }}-color{% endcapture %}

        <label for="{{ attribute_name }}">Color:</label>
        <select name="attributes[{{ attribute_name }}]" id="{{ attribute_name }}">
            <option value="red">Red</option>
            <option value="green">Green</option>
            <option value="blue">Blue</option>
        </select>

    For more, see Template::Liquid::Tag::Capture.

Standard Liquid Filters
    Please see Template::Liquid::Filters::Standard.

Extending Template::Liquid
    Extending the Template::Liquid template engine for your needs is almost
    too simple. Keep reading.

  Custom Filters
    Filters are simple subs called when needed. They are not passed any
    state data by design and must return the modified content.

   "Template::Liquid::register_filter( ... )"
    This registers a package which Template::Liquid will assume contains one
    or more filters.

        # Register a package as a filter
        Template::Liquid::register_filter( 'Template::Solution::Filter::Amalgamut' );

        # Or simply say...
        Template::Liquid::register_filter( );
        # ...and Template::Liquid will assume the filters are in the calling package

  Custom Tags
    See the section entitled Extending Template::Liquid with Custom Tags in
    Template::Liquid::Tag for more information.

    To assist with custom tag creation, Template::Liquid provides several
    basic tag types for subclassing and exposes the following methods:

   "Template::Liquid::register_tag( ... )"
    This registers a package which must contain (directly or through
    inheritance) both a "parse" and "render" method.

        # Register a new tag which Template::Liquid will look for in the calling package
        Template::Liquid::register_tag( 'newtag' );

        # Or simply say...
        Template::Liquid::register_tag( 'newtag' );
        # ...and Template::Liquid will assume the new tag is in the calling package

    Pre-existing tags are replaced when new tags are registered with the
    same name. You may want to do this to override some functionality.

    For an example of a custom tag, see Solution::Tag::Include and
    Solution::Tag::Dump.

Why should I use Template::Liquid?
    *   You want to allow your users to edit the appearance of your
        application, but don't want them to run insecure code on your
        server.

    *   You want to render templates directly from the database.

    *   You like Smarty-style template engines.

    *   You need a template engine which does HTML just as well as email.

    *   You don't like the markup language of your current template engine.

    *   You wasted three days reinventing this wheel when you could have
        been doing something productive like volunteering or catching up on
        past seasons of *Doctor Who*.

Why shouldn't I use Template::Liquid?
    *   You've found or written a template engine which fills your needs
        better than Liquid or Template::Liquid ever could.

    *   You are uncomfortable with text that you didn't copy and paste
        yourself. Everyone knows computers cannot be trusted.

Template::LiquidX or Solution?
    I'd really rather use Solution::{Package} for extentions but who cares?

    As I understand it, the original project's name, Liquid, is a reference
    to the classical states of matter (the engine itself being stateless). I
    settled on solution <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution> because it's
    liquid but... with... bits of other stuff floating in it. (Pretend you
    majored in chemistry instead of mathematics or computer science.) Liquid
    tempates will *always* work with Template::Liquid but (due to
    Solutions's expanded syntax) Solution templates *may not* be compatible
    with Liquid or Template::Liquid.
