The Perl module NetObj::MacAddress represents [MAC
addresses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAC_address).  The goal is to use an
abstraction independent of any particular string representation.

NetObj::MacAddress is a class built using the built-in object framework of Perl
with the goal to be compatible with [Moo](https://metacpan.org/pod/Moo).  It
fits right into the [Moose](https://metacpan.org/pod/Moose) object oriented
framework.
