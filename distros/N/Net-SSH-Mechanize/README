NAME
    Net::SSH::Mechanize - asynchronous ssh command invocation

VERSION
    version 0.1.3

SYNOPSIS
    Somewhat like "POE::Component::OpenSSH", "SSH::Batch",
    "Net::OpenSSH::Parallel", "App::MrShell" etc, but:

    *   It uses the asynchonous "AnyEvent" event framework.

    *   It aims to support sudoing smoothly.

    Synchronous usage:

        use Net::SSH::Mechanize;

        # Create an instance. This will not log in yet.
        # All but the host name below are optional.
        # Your .ssh/config will be used as normal, so if you 
        # define ssh settings for a host there they will be picked up.
        my $ssh = Net::SSH::Mechanize->new(
            host => 'somewhere.com',
            user => 'jbloggs',
            password => 'secret',
            port => 22,
        );

        my $ssh->login;

        my $output = $ssh->capture("id");

        # If successful, $output now contains something like:
        # uid=1000(jbloggs) gid=1000(jbloggs) groups=1000(jbloggs)

        $output = $ssh->sudo_capture("id");

        # If successful, $output now contains something like:
        # uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)

        $ssh->logout;

    As you can see, "Net::SSH::Mechanize" instance connects to only *one*
    host. Net::SSH::Mechanize::Multi manages connections to many.

    See below for further examples, and "script/gofer" in the distribution
    source for a working, usable example.

    This is work in progress. Expect rough edges. Feedback appreciated.

DESCRIPTION
    The point about using "AnyEvent" internally is that "blocking" method
    calls only block the current "thread", and so the above can be used in
    parallel with (for example) other ssh sessions in the same process
    (using "AnyEvent", or "Coro"). Although a sub-process is spawned for
    each ssh command, the parent process manages the child processes
    asynchronously, without blocking or polling.

    Here is an example of asynchronous usage, using the
    "<AnyEvent-"condvar>> API. Calls return an "<AnyEvent::CondVar">
    instance, which you can call the usual "->recv" and "->cb" methods on to
    perform a blocking wait (within the current thread), or assign a
    callback to be called on completion (respectively). See AnyEvent.

    This is effectively what the example in the synopsis is doing, behind
    the scenes.

        use Net::SSH::Mechanize;

        # Create an instance, as above.
        my $ssh = Net::SSH::Mechanize->new(
            host => 'somewhere.com',
            user => 'jbloggs',
            password => 'secret',
            port => 22,
        );

        # Accessing ->capture calls ->login automatically.
        my $condvar = AnyEvent->condvar;
        $ssh->login_async->cb(sub {
            my ($session) = shift->recv;
            $session->capture_async("id")->cb(sub {
                my ($stderr_handle, $result) = shift->recv;

                $condvar->send($result);
            });
        });

        # ... this returns immediately.  The callbacks assigned will get
        # invoked behind the scenes, and we just need to wait and collect
        # the result handed to our $condvar.

        my $result = $convar->recv;

        # If successful, $output now contains something like:
        # uid=1000(jbloggs) gid=1000(jbloggs) groups=1000(jbloggs)

        $ssh->logout;

    You would only need to use this asynchronous style if you wanted to
    interface with "AnyEvent", and/or add some "Expect"-like interaction
    into the code.

    However, see also "Net::SSH::Mechanize::Multi" for a more convenient way
    of running multiple ssh sessions in parallel. It uses Coro to provide a
    (cooperatively) threaded model.

  gofer
    The "script/" sub-directory includes a command-line tool called "gofer"
    which is designed to accept a list of connection definitions, and
    execute shell commands supplied in the arguments in parallel on each.
    See the documentation in the script for more information.

JUSTIFICATION
    The problem with all other SSH wrappers I've tried so far is that they
    do not cope well when you need to sudo. Some of them do it but
    unreliably ("SSH::Batch"), others allow it with some help, but then
    don't assist with parallel connections to many servers ("Net::OpenSSH").
    The I tried "POE::Component::OpenSSH", but I found the
    "POE::Component::Generic" implementation forced a painful programming
    style with long chains of functions, one for each step in an exchange
    with the ssh process.

    Possibly I just didn't try them all, or hard enough, but I really needed
    something which could do the job, and fell back to re-inventing the
    wheel. Initial experiments with "AnyEvent" and "AnyEvent::Subprocess"
    showed a lot of promise, and the result is this.

CLASS METHODS
  "$obj = $class->new(%params)"
    Creates a new instance. Parameters is a hash or a list of key-value
    parameters. Valid parameter keys are:

    "connection_params"
        A Net::SSH::Mechanize::ConnectParams instance, which defines a host
        connection. If this is given, any individual connection parameters
        also supplied to the constructor ("host", "user", "port" or
        "password"), will be ignored.

        If this is absent, a "Net::SSH::Mechanize::ConnectParams" instance
        is constructed from any other individual connection parameters - the
        minimum which must be supplied is "hostname". See below.

    "host"
        The hostname to connect to. Either this or "connection_params" must
        be supplied.

    "user"
        The user account to log into. If not given, no user will be supplied
        to "ssh" (this typically means it will use the current user as
        default).

    "port"
        The port to connect to ("ssh" will default to 22 if this is not
        specificed).

    "password"
        The password to connect with. This is only required if
        authentication will be performed, either on log-in or when sudoing.

    "login_timeout"
        How long to wait before breaking a connection (in seconds). It is
        passed to "AnyEvent-"timer> handler, whose callback will terminate
        the session if the period is exceeded. This avoids hung connections
        when the remote end isn't answering, or isn't answering in a way
        that will allow "Net::SSH::Mechanize" to terminate.

        The default is 30.

INSTANCE ATTRIBUTES
  "$params = $obj->connection_params"
    This is a read-only accessor for the "connection_params" instance passed
    to the constructor (or equivalently, constructed from the constructor
    parameters).

  "$session = $obj->session"
    This is read-only accessor to a lazily-instantiated
    "Net::SSH::Mechanize::Session" instance, which represents the "ssh"
    process. Accessing it causes the session to be created and the remote
    host to be logged into.

  "$obj->login_timeout($integer)"
=head2 "$integer = $obj->login_timeout"
    This is a read-write accessor to the log-in timeout parameter passed to
    the constructor.

    It is passed to "Net::SSH::Mechanize::Session"'s constructor, so if you
    plan to modify it, do so before "->session" has been instantiated or
    will not have any effect on anything thereafter.

INSTANCE METHODS
  "login"
=head2 "login_async"
=head2 "capture"
=head2 "capture_async"
=head2 "sudo_capture"
=head2 "sudo_capture_async"
=head2 "logout"
    These methods exist here for convenience; they delegate to the
    equivalent "Net::SSH::Mechanize::Session" methods.

KNOWN ISSUES
    "unexpected stderr from command: stderr output" in test output
        Something I haven't yet figured out how to banish properly. However,
        it does appear to be harmless. Patches welcome.

SEE ALSO
    There are a lot of related tools, and this is just in Perl. Probably the
    most similar are "SSH::Batch", "POE::Component::OpenSSH", and
    "App::MrShell" (which at the time of writing, I've not yet tried.) None
    use "AnyEvent", so far as I can tell.

    SSH::Batch, Net::OpenSSH, Net::OpenSSH::Parallel, Net::SSH, Net::SSH2,
    Net::SSH::Expect, Net::SSH::Perl, POE::Component::OpenSSH, App::MrShell.
