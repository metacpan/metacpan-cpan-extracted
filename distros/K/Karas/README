DESCRIPTION
    Karas is yet another O/R mapper.

    THIS IS A DEVELOPMENT RELEASE. API MAY CHANGE WITHOUT NOTICE.

FEATURES
    fork safe connection management
    nested, scoped transaction support using DBIx:TransactionManager

METHODS
  Constructor
    my $db = Karas->new(%args)
        Create new instance of Karas.

        You can pass following arguments as hash:

        connect_info(Required)
            connect_info is an arguments for "DBI->connect".

        query_builder(Optional)
            This is a query builder. You need to pass the child class
            instance of SQL::Maker.

            Default value is : "Karas::QueryBuilder->new()".

  Connection
    $db->connect([@args])
        Connect to Database immediately.

        If you pass @args, $db->{connec_info} will upgrade by @args.

    $db->reconnect([@args])
        Reconnect to Database immediately.

        If you pass @args, $db->{connec_info} will upgrade by @args.

    $db->dbh()
        Get a database handle. If the connection was closed, Karas
        reconnects automatically.

  SQL Operations
    my @rows = $db->search($table, $where[, $opt])
        Search rows from database. For more details, please see SQL::Maker.

    my $count = $db->count($table[, $where])
        Count rows by $where.

    my ($rows, $pager) = $db->search_with_pager($table, $where[, $opt])
        *$pager* is instance of Data::Page::NoTotalEntries.

    my @rows = $db->search_by_sql($sql, $binds[, $table_name]);
        Search rows by SQL.

        *$table_name* is optional. Karas finds table name by $sql
        automatically.

    my $row = $db->insert($table, $values);
        Insert row to database. And refetch row from database.

    $db->fast_insert($table, $values);
        Insert row to database.

    $db->replace($table, $values);
        Replace into row to database.

    $db->update($row, \%opts)
        Update row object by \%opts.

    my $affected_rows = $db->update($table_name, $set, $where)
        Update *$table_name* set *$set* where *$where*.

    $db->delete($row);
        Delete row object from database.

    $db->delete($table_name, $where)
        Delete $table_name where $where.

    $db->refetch($row)
        Refetch *$row* object from database.

    $db->bulk_insert($table_name, $rows_data)
            $db->bulk_insert('member', [
                +{ name => 'John', email => 'john@example.com' },
                +{ name => 'Ben',  email => 'ben@example.com' },
            ])

        This is a bulk insert method. see SQL::Maker::Plugin::InsertMulti.

  Row class map management
    $db->get_row_class($table_name);
        Clear row class from table name.

  Transaction
    my $guard = $db->txn_scope();
        Start transaction scope with DBIx::TransactionManager. See
        DBIx::TransactionManager for more details.

Plugins
    Karas->load_plugin($name[, $args])
        Load plugin and install it. $name is a class name of plugin.

        You can use two style of $name. If you want to use plugin under the
        'Karas::Plugin::Name' namespace, you just write 'Name' part. If you
        want to put your plugin on your favorite namespace, you can
        pass'+My::Own::Plugin' as $name.

        $args is a argument for "Karas::Plugin::Foo->new($args)".

  Utilities
    $db->last_insert_id()
        Get a last_insert_id from $dbh.

ROW CLASS DETECTION
    Karas loads row class from your load path. If you are using Karas class
    directly, Karas does not loads any row class. But if you use it as a
    parent class like following:

        parent MyDB;
        use parent qw/Karas/;
