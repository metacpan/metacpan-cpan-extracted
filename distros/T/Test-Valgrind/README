NAME
    Test::Valgrind - Generate suppressions, analyse and test any command
    with valgrind.

VERSION
    Version 1.19

SYNOPSIS
        # From the command-line
        perl -MTest::Valgrind leaky.pl

        # From the command-line, snippet style
        perl -MTest::Valgrind -e 'leaky()'

        # In a test file
        use Test::More;
        eval 'use Test::Valgrind';
        plan skip_all => 'Test::Valgrind is required to test your distribution with valgrind' if $@;
        leaky();

        # In all the test files of a directory
        prove --exec 'perl -Iblib/lib -Iblib/arch -MTest::Valgrind' t/*.t

DESCRIPTION
    This module is a front-end to the "Test::Valgrind::*" API that lets you
    run Perl code through the "memcheck" tool of the "valgrind" memory
    debugger, to test for memory errors and leaks. If they aren't available
    yet, it will first generate suppressions for the current "perl"
    interpreter and store them in the portable flavour of
    ~/.perl/Test-Valgrind/suppressions/$VERSION. The actual run will then
    take place, and tests will be passed or failed according to the result
    of the analysis.

    The complete API is much more versatile than this. By declaring an
    appropriate Test::Valgrind::Command class, you can run any executable
    (that is, not only Perl scripts) under valgrind, generate the
    corresponding suppressions on-the-fly and convert the analysis result to
    TAP output so that it can be incorporated into your project's testsuite.
    If you're not interested in producing TAP, you can output the results in
    whatever format you like (for example HTML pages) by defining your own
    Test::Valgrind::Action class.

    Due to the nature of perl's memory allocator, this module can't track
    leaks of Perl objects. This includes non-mortalized scalars and memory
    cycles. However, it can track leaks of chunks of memory allocated in XS
    extensions with "Newx" and friends or "malloc". As such, it's
    complementary to the other very good leak detectors listed in the "SEE
    ALSO" section.

METHODS
  "analyse"
        Test::Valgrind->analyse(%options);

    Run a "valgrind" analysis configured by %options :

    *   "command => $command"

        The Test::Valgrind::Command object (or class name) to use.

        Defaults to Test::Valgrind::Command::PerlScript.

    *   "tool => $tool"

        The Test::Valgrind::Tool object (or class name) to use.

        Defaults to Test::Valgrind::Tool::memcheck.

    *   "action => $action"

        The Test::Valgrind::Action object (or class name) to use.

        Defaults to Test::Valgrind::Action::Test.

    *   "file => $file"

        The file name of the script to analyse.

        Ignored if you supply your own custom "command", but mandatory
        otherwise.

    *   "callers => $number"

        Specify the maximum stack depth studied when valgrind encounters an
        error. Raising this number improves granularity.

        Ignored if you supply your own custom "tool", otherwise defaults to
        24 (the maximum allowed by "valgrind").

    *   "diag => $bool"

        If true, print the output of the test script as diagnostics.

        Ignored if you supply your own custom "action", otherwise defaults
        to false.

    *   "regen_def_supp => $bool"

        If true, forcefully regenerate the default suppression file.

        Defaults to false.

    *   "no_def_supp => $bool"

        If true, do not use the default suppression file.

        Defaults to false.

    *   "allow_no_supp => $bool"

        If true, force running the analysis even if the suppression files do
        not refer to any "perl"-related symbol.

        Defaults to false.

    *   "extra_supps => \@files"

        Also use suppressions from @files besides "perl"'s.

        Defaults to empty.

  "import"
        use Test::Valgrind %options;

    In the parent process, "import" calls "analyse" with the arguments it
    received itself - except that if no "file" option was supplied, it tries
    to pick the first caller context that looks like a script. When the
    analysis ends, it exits with the status returned by the action (for the
    default TAP-generator action, it's the number of failed tests).

    In the child process, it just "return"s so that the calling code is
    actually run under "valgrind", albeit two side-effects :

    *   Perl::Destruct::Level is loaded and the destruction level is set to
        3.

    *   Autoflush on "STDOUT" is turned on.

VARIABLES
  $dl_unload
    When set to true, all dynamic extensions that were loaded during the
    analysis will be unloaded at "END" time by "dl_unload_file" in
    DynaLoader.

    Since this obfuscates error stack traces, it's disabled by default.

CAVEATS
    Perl 5.8 is notorious for leaking like there's no tomorrow, so the
    suppressions are very likely not to be complete on it. You also have a
    better chance to get more accurate results if your perl is built with
    debugging enabled. Using the latest "valgrind" available will also help.

    This module is not really secure. It's definitely not taint safe. That
    shouldn't be a problem for test files.

    What your tests output to "STDOUT" and "STDERR" is eaten unless you pass
    the "diag" option, in which case it will be reprinted as diagnostics.
