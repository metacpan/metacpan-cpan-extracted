NAME
    Catalyst::Plugin::Log::Handler - Catalyst Plugin for Log::Handler

VERSION
    Version 0.08

SYNOPSIS
        use Catalyst qw(Log::Handler);

    Catalyst configuration (e. g. in YAML format):

        Log::Handler:
            file:
                filename: /var/log/myapp.log
                fileopen: 1
                mode: append
                newline: 1

    To log a message:

        $c->log->debug('Greetings from the people of earth');
        $c->log->info ('This is an info message.');
        $c->log->warn ('This is the last warning.');
        $c->log->error('This is an error message.');
        $c->log->fatal('This is a fatal message.');
        $c->handler->crit('This is a critical message.');

DESCRIPTION
    If your Catalyst project logs many messages, logging via standard error
    to Apache's error log is not very clean: The log messages are mixed with
    other web applications' noise; and especially if you use mod_fastcgi,
    every line will be prepended with a long prefix.

    An alternative is logging to a file. But then you have to make sure that
    multiple processes won't corrupt the log file. The module Log::Handler
    by Jonny Schulz does exactly this, because it supports message-wise
    flocking.

    This module is a wrapper for said Log::Handler.

METHODS
  debug, info, warn, error, fatal
    These methods map to the Log::Handler methods with the same name, except
    for fatal, which maps to emergency, and warn, which maps to warning.
    This is because Catalyst and Log::Handler don't use the same names for
    log levels.

    To log a message with a level that is no common Catalyst log level, you
    can use the handler method (see SYNOPSIS).

  is_debug, is_info, is_warn, is_error, is_fatal
    These methods map to the Log::Handler methods is_debug, is_info,
    is_warning, is_error, is_emergency, respectively.

  handler
    Returns the Log::Handler object.

CONFIGURATION
    All configuration options are passed verbatim to Log::Handler::new. See
    Log::Handler for explanation of the options. I think that the example
    configuration at the beginning of this document is very well-suited for
    a Catalyst application. (Except for the file name, of course.)

    To be consistent with Catalyst::Log, the options minlevel and maxlevel
    default to 0 and 7, respectively, i. e. all messages are logged. The
    other defaults are not touched.

    If you use Catalyst::Plugin::ConfigLoader, please load this module after
    Catalyst::Plugin::ConfigLoader.
