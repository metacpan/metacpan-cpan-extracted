Fidonet/FTN Database Application (App-FTNDB)

SQLite, and which includes FTN Nodelist processing.

Required, neccessary and/or useful modules, etc.:

FTN::Database    Must be a least v0.34. May already be installed on your
    system; if not, one place it may be obtained is at CPAN (www.cpan.org).

App::Cmd    May already be installed on your system; if not, one place it
    may be obtained is at CPAN (www.cpan.org).

DBD::SQLite SQLite DBD Module is required by default, so should be installed.
    Any other database engines will be named similarly and should be
    installed if used. May already be installed on your system; if
    not, one place they may be obtained is at CPAN (www.cpan.org).

FTN::Log    Must be a least v0.02, for the 'logging' subroutine as used in
    the ftndb-nodelist and ftndb-admin scripts. If not already
    installed, it can be obtained from CPAN (www.cpan.org) or from
    the ftnpl project at Sourceforge.

Getopt::Std May already be installed on your system; if not, one place
    it may be obtained is at CPAN (www.cpan.org).

The FTN Database application is hosted at the 'Perl for FTN Systems' project
at SourceForge (ftnpl.sourceforge.net).  The ftnpl-user or ftnpl-develop mailing
lists are available from the project site; however, the FTN echos like PERL or
BBS_CARNIVAL can be used for discussions regarding it as well and are the
preferred avenues for support.

Note that the code history for the FTN Database application is available in a
git repository at the Sourceforge project, as follows:

http://git.code.sf.net/p/ftnpl/ftndb/code (Browse Online)
git clone git://git.code.sf.net/p/ftnpl/ftndb/code (Read Only)

Note also that in distribution archives created directly from the repository,
the commit id can obtained like as follows:
    zcat ftndb-n.nn.tar.gz | git get-tar-commit-id
