Business::KontoCheck version 6.15
=================================

This module checks the validity of German Bank Account Numbers. All currently
defined test methods by Deutsche Bundesbank (currently: 00 to E4, May 2019)
are implemented.

The check module for austrian Bank Account nunmbers was removed, because the
austrian INPAR service by PSA Austria will expire in 2018.

The original library is a C library; the Perl port was build using the h2xs
tool.

A longer description and the history file are included as 00liesmich.txt and
0_history.txt (both in german). The C library is available from
http://sourceforge.net/projects/kontocheck


DOCUMENTATION

short description of (most) export functions is included in the file

command "perldoc Businesss::KontoCheck".
