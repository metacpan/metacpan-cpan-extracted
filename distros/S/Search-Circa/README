WHAT IS THIS?

This is Circa, a module who provide facilities to build
and use a Perl search engine running with Mysql. 
Circa is for your Web site, or for a list of sites. 
It indexes like Altavista does. It can read, add and 
parse all url's found in a page. It add url and word 
to MySQL for use it at search.

HOW DO I INSTALL IT?

You need the following modules : DBI, DBD-Mysql, 
LWP::RobotUA, URI::URL and HTML::Parser 3.0 if you can. 
Else a defaut parser will be used.

To install this module, cd to the directory that contains 
this README file and type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install
   make cgi

Don't forget the last target !
Then, you can do:

In command line:
admin.pl +create +add=http://www.monsite.com +parse_new=1 +depth_max
for index your first url.

Then for make a search, you can do:
search.pl +word='my word'

With CGI:
Run admin.cgi on http://localhost/cgi-bin/circa
Do:
  - Create table
  - Add one account
  - Select it and index url
Then run search.cgi on http://localhost/cgi-bin/circa

WHERE IS THE DOCUMENTATION?

You'll find very verbose documentation in the file 
Indexer.pm in POD format

When you install Circa::Indexer, the MakeMaker program 
will automatically install the manual pages for you 
(on Unix systems, type "man Circa::Indexer").

WHERE ARE THE EXAMPLES?

A collection of examples demonstrating various features 
and techniques are in the directory "demo". You can use 
admin.pl on command line or admin.cgi with CGI.

Have fun, and let me know how it turns out!
