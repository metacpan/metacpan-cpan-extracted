Version 0.002000 - 2014-06-23
 - This module no longer prefixes info() messages with "info:", so that
   info messages are equivalent to printing the text.
 - Changed STDERR to STDOUT, since most logging tools actually connect
   STDOUT to the logger.
 - No longer join message parts with a space, and just concatenate them.
   This matches better with other logging back-ends.

Version 0.001002 - 2014-05-19
 - Basic support for all logging methods, prefixing all output with
   the canonical name of the log level.
 - Default filter is info and below.
 - Support for custom dumpers, used for non-scalars passed to 'debug'
   or 'trace' or any of the formatting '*f()' functions.
 - Embedded newlines converted to properly prefixed log lines.
