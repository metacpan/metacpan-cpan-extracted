Welcome to EtText!
------------------

EtText is a simple plain-text format which allows conversion to and from HTML.
Instead of editing HTML directly, it provides an easy-to-edit, easy-to-read and
intuitive way to write HTML, based on the plain-text markup conventions we've
been using for years.

Like most simple text markup formats (POD, setext, etc.), EtText markup handles
the usual things: insertion of P tags, header recognition and markup. However
it also adds a powerful link markup system.

EtText markup is simple and effective; it's very similar to WikiWikiWeb
TextFormattingRules or Zope's StructuredText.

EtText is distributed under the same licensing terms as Perl itself.

INSTALLATION
------------

For all UNIX platforms:
-----------------------

Untar the .tar.gz file, and "cd" into the directory. Then run:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make install		(as root)

That will install the Text::EtText modules and the commands "ettext2html" and
"ethtml2text".

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

For Windows using ActiveState Perl or IndigoPerl:
-------------------------------------------------

Unzip the .zip distribution, and "cd" into the directory created. Then
run:

	perl windows_install.pl

This will generate some .bat files which allow you to run the scripts
from that directory.

If this command fails, you probably do not have Perl installed, or the
directory it's installed in is not in your PATH.  Check this and try
again.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

For Windows using ActiveState Perl, or IndigoPerl, and NMAKE:
-------------------------------------------------------------

Another way to install WebMake is as a traditional Perl module, using
"perl Makefile.PL" and Microsoft's NMAKE, included with MS DevStudio.
Here's what one user has to say on this subject:

    nmake works nicely, and the installation process looks the same as on
    other platforms.

    My understanding is that nmake.exe is available for free from Redmond.
    In fact I downloaded it just a few minutes ago, following the
    suggestion found on the IndigoPerl home page:

      Installing CPAN modules requires that you have Microsoft DevStudio
      or nmake.exe installed.  If you are installing modules that contain
      xs files, then you need DevStudio, otherwise you only need
      nmake.exe.  You can download nmake from [the url below].

      Run the self-extracting exe and copy nmake.exe to the perl\bin
      directory.

[the URL is:
http://download.microsoft.com/download/vc15/Patch/1.52/W95/EN-US/Nmake15.exe
]

    Nmake15.exe expands to nmake.exe (64K) and Nmake.Err (5k) - a text
    file.  I copied both to C:\perl\bin, then renamed nmake.exe to
    make.exe and now I can pretend to be on Unix:

        H:\devperl\Text-EtText-0.5>makefile
        Writing Makefile for Text::EtText

	H:\devperl\Text-EtText-0.5>make ...

        H:\devperl\Text-EtText-0.5>make test
        ...

The upshot is: if you download NMAKE, rename it to "make.exe", and install
it in your path, Perl can install modules just fine using the traditional
perl module install procedure on Windows.  In fact, it may be possible to
simply use NMAKE as "nmake.exe" instead of "make.exe", from the look of
it.
