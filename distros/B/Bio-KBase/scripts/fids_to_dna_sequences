=head1 fids_to_dna_sequences


fids_to_dna_sequences allows the user to look up the DNA sequences
corresponding to each of a set of fids.


Example:

    fids_to_dna_sequences [arguments] < input > output

The standard input should be a tab-separated table (i.e., each line
is a tab-separated set of fields).  Normally, the last field in each
line would contain the identifer. If another column contains the identifier
use

    -c N

where N is the column (from 1) that contains the subsystem.

This is a pipe command. The input is taken from the standard input, and the
output is to the standard output.

=head2 Documentation for underlying call

This script is a wrapper for the CDMI-API call fids_to_dna_sequences. It is documented as follows:

  $return = $obj->fids_to_dna_sequences($fids)

=over 4

=item Parameter and return types

=begin html

<pre>
$fids is a fids
$return is a reference to a hash where the key is a fid and the value is a dna_sequence
fids is a reference to a list where each element is a fid
fid is a string
dna_sequence is a string

</pre>

=end html

=begin text

$fids is a fids
$return is a reference to a hash where the key is a fid and the value is a dna_sequence
fids is a reference to a list where each element is a fid
fid is a string
dna_sequence is a string

=head2 Command-Line Options

=over 4

=item -c Column

This is used only if the column containing the subsystem is not the last column.

=item -i InputFile    [ use InputFile, rather than stdin ]

=item -fasta

This is used to request a fasta output file (dropping all of the other columns in the input lines).
It defaults to outputing just a fasta entry.

=back

=head2 Output Format

The standard output is just a fasta file with the sequence.  You can also get
a tab-delimited file by using -fasta=0.  The tab-delimited format consists of the input
file with an extra column of sequence  added.

Input lines that cannot be extended are written to stderr.
