Revision history for Perl extension NewsLib

0.84	Thu Apr 22 11:30:50 CDT 2004 
	- Deprecating News::NNTPAuth in favor of Net::NNTP::Auth.  
	- News::Article is no longer distributed with this, since it's
	  already in CPAN.
	- Standardized formatting of version numbers and such.
	- Better documention in the REAMDE file.

0.83b 	Thu Apr 22 10:50:44 CDT 2004 
	- Put News::Cancel back in as News::Article::Cancel.  It is now,
	  though, just a module that inherits News::Article.
	- Net::NNTP::Auth is now v1.0 (no real changes except docs)

0.82b 	Thu Mar 18 14:28:37 CST 2004 
	- Added News::Article::Clean.

0.81b 	Fri Feb 13 16:24:01 CST 2004 
	- Made News::Cancel into its own module, not a sub-version of
	  News::Article.  I'm not entirely happy with this, but it's a start.

0.80b 	Fri Oct 10 10:11:09 CDT 2003
