DESCRIPTION
    The 'Tie::Gzip' module provides a file handle Tie for compressing and
    uncompressing files using the gzip compression format.

    By tieing a filehandle to 'Tie::Gzip' subsequent uses of the file
    subroutines with the tied filehandle will compress data written to an
    opened file using gzip compression and decompress data read from an
    opened file using gzip compression.

    If the 'Tie::Gzip' tie receives a *filename* or *mode filename* after
    completing the tie, 'Tie::Gzip' will open *filename*.

    During the tie, Tie::Gzip will first try to load the 'Compress::Zlib'
    module and package. If successful, 'Tie::Gzip' uses the 'Compress::Zlib'
    for compressing and decompressing the file data.

    If unsuccessful, 'Tie::Gzip' setups up the following pipes to an
    anticipated GNU 'gzip' site command for compressing and decompressing
    the file data:

     gzip --decompress --stdout {} | # read file data
     | gzip --stdout > {} # write file data

    where the string '{}' is a placeholder for the *filename*.

    Many sites, especially UNIX Internet Service Providers, will not provide
    the 'Compress::Zlib' module. Instead they expect the users to make use
    of a site Unix gzip command.

    If neither of these gzip resources are available for a site, 'Tie::Gzip'
    provides the 'read_pipe' and 'write_pipe' options, to tie to a suitable
    local site gzip command.

    For example, to specify the GNU gzip, provide the following options as
    either a hash or array reference:

     [ read_pipe => 'gzip --decompress --stdout {}',
       write_pipe => ' gzip --stdout > {}' ]

    The pipe symbol '|' is optional. The 'Tie::Gzip' uses the 'binmode' for
    all data to and from the read and write pipes. This is equivalent to
    'raw' (as oppose to 'cooked') for Unix file drivers and the binary (as
    oppose to 'text') for Windows file drivers.

    The hash reference to the 'Tie::Gzip' data may be obtained as follows:

      my $self = tied filehandle;
  
    The 'Tie::Gzip' data hash keys and contents are subject to change
    without notice expect for

      $self->{options}->{read_pipe}
      $self->{options}->{write_pipe}

    as described above.

    Because of the nature of the gzip compression software, the file
    subroutines have at least the following restrictions:

    open
        The open command will accept only the '>' and the '<' modes. All
        other modes are invalid. The 'Tie::Gzip' tie does provide greatly
        limited piping capabilities with the 'read_pipe' and 'write_pipe'
        options. Feature creep of reading and writing a compress file is
        coming.

    seek
        The seek is only valid for mode 1, positive seeks when reading a
        compress files. Feature creep of seek is comming.

    fileno
        The file no when using "Compress::Zlib" is undefined.

    binmode
        This subroutine does nothing since the tied 'Tie::Gzip' file handle
        is always in the binmode.

REQUIREMENTS
    For these requirements the pharse 'Tie Gzip file handle' will mean a
    file handle successfully tied to 'Tie::Gzip' that uses either the
    'Compress::Zlib' module or the a site system GNU gzip executable to
    compress and decompress the file data. Thus, the data written to a file
    using a 'Tie::Gzip file handle' should be in accordance with RFC 1951
    and RFC 1952.

    The 'Tie::Gzip' requirements are as follows:

    data integrity [1]
        The data read back from a file using a 'Tie::Gzip file handle'
        shall[1] be the same as the data written to the file using a
        'Tie::Gzip file handle'.

    interoperability [1]
        The data read back from a file using a software unit or executable
        program in accordance with RFC 1951 and RFC 1952 shall[1] be the
        same as the data written to the same file using a 'Tie::Gzip file
        handle'.

    interoperability [2]
        The data read back from a file using 'Tie::Gzip file handle shall[2]
        be the same as the data written to the same file using a software
        unit or executable program in accordance with RFC 1951 and RFC 1952.

QUALITY ASSURANCE
  Test Script Design

    The "Tie:Gzip" test script performs multiple duties. The "Tie::Gzip"
    program module finds a gzip software unit of opportunity looking for
    both Perl "Compress::Zlib" program module and a site operating system
    gzip with the following GNU syntax:

     read_pipe => 'gzip --decompress --stdout {}',
     write_pipe => 'gzip --stdout > {}',

    If a particular site does not support both gzips, those tests, such as
    the interoperatability between different gzip software units, are
    skipped.

    For quality assurance, the "Tie::Gzip" test is performed on a site that
    supports both. For installation test, only one is needed for a pass.
    However if an installation supports both, both should pass in order to
    meet the interoperatability requirement for the "Tie::Gzip" module. This
    of course does not test that files produced from gzip software units
    outside the site are interoperatable. However, since the site gzip used
    for the quality assurance test meets the RFC 1951 and RFC 1952, the
    chances are that the gzip outside the site is broken if "Tie::Gzip"
    cannot decompress it.

  Test Script Software and Operation

    Running the test script 'Gzip.t' found in the "Tie-Gzip-$VERSION.tar.gz"
    distribution file verifies the requirements for this module.

    All testing software and documentation stems from the Software Test
    Description (STD) program module 't::Tie::Gzip', found in the
    distribution file "Tie-Gzip-$VERSION.tar.gz".

    The 't::Tie::Gzip' STD POD contains a tracebility matix between the
    requirements established above for this module, and the test steps
    identified by a 'ok' number from running the 'Gzip.t' test script.

    The t::Tie::Gzip' STD program module '__DATA__' section contains the
    data to perform the following:

    *   to generate the test script 'Gzip.t'

    *   generate the tailored STD POD in the 't::Tie::Gzip' module,

    *   generate the 'Gzip.d' demo script,

    *   replace the POD demonstration section herein with the demo script
        'Gzip.d' output, and

    *   run the test script using Test::Harness with or without the verbose
        option,

    To perform all the above, prepare and run the automation software as
    follows:

    *   Install "Test_STDmaker-$VERSION.tar.gz" from one of the
        respositories only if it has not been installed:

        *   http://www.softwarediamonds/packages/

        *   http://www.perl.com/CPAN-local/authors/id/S/SO/SOFTDIA/

    *   manually place the script tmake.pl in
        "Test_STDmaker-$VERSION.tar.gz' in the site operating system
        executable path only if it is not in the executable path

    *   place the 't::Tie::Gzip' at the same level in the directory struture
        as the directory holding the 'Tie::Gzip' module

    *   execute the following in any directory:

         tmake -test_verbose -replace -run -pm=t::Tie::Gzip

NOTES
  RELATED MODULES

    The package 'CPAN::Tarzip::TIEHANDLE' buried deep in the 'CPAN' module
    has a bare bones tie to decompress gzip files. A study of this package
    proved valuable in identifying some of the pitfalls that the author of
    this package encountered in his similar endeavor. One issue was that
    'Compress::Zlib' gzip subroutines/methods will return data entact from a
    file that is not compress as well as compress gzip file contents without
    any signaling of the differences in the raw file contents.

    This 'Compress::Gzip' module follows the overall direction of
    'CPAN::Tarzip::TIEHANDLE' in handling this issue with a different code
    implementation.

    Another related module is the 'PerlIO::gzip' module that implements the
    gzip file disciplines. Gzip file disciplines are available in the newer
    version of Perls. Altough the C code was not examined for this module,
    there appears in the POD a somewhat different approach to processing the
    file content that is not gzip compressed. There is a lot of gzip header
    checking and whatever.

    Many of the older Perls in wide spread use do not support file
    disciplines.

    head2 FEEDBACK

    From: Mark.Scarton@FranklinCovey.com Date: Thu, 19 Feb 2004 17:23:37
    -0700

    In the 'lib/Tie/Gzip.pm' module of the Tie-Gzip-0.01 package, the open
    of the pipe ("gzip --decompress --stdout |") is failing due to the
    reference to $! in the conditional. As a test, I cleared $! before
    issuing the open call as follows:

    Line 124:

                 ###############
                 # Some perls will return a glob and a warning
                 # for certain pipe errors such as the command
                 # not a recognized command
                 #
                 $! = 0;    ### MAS ###
                 my $success = open PIPE, $pipe;
                 if($! || !$success) {
                     warn "Could not pipe $pipe: $!\n";
                     $self->CLOSE;
                     return undef;
                 }

    Line 167:

                 ###############
                 # Some perls will return a glob and a warning
                 # for certain pipe errors such as the command
                 # not a recognized command
                 #
                 $! = 0;    ### MAS ###
                 my $success = open PIPE, $pipe;
                 if($! || !$success) {
                     warn "Could not pipe $pipe: $!\n";
                     $self->CLOSE;
                     return undef;
                 }

    This works. Prior to making this change, test 6 of Gzip.t would fail.

    According to the Learning Perl O'Reilly book,

    "But if you use die to indicate an error that is not the failure of a
    system request, don't include $!, since it will generally hold an
    unrelated message left over from something Perl did internally. It will
    hold a useful value only immediately after a failed system request. A
    successful request won't leave anything useful there."

    So $! is only sourced when a system error occurs and it is not cleared
    prior to the call. If no error occurs, the value is indeterminate.

1.0 SCOPE
    This paragraph identifies and provides an overview of the released
    files.

  1.1 Identification

    This release, identified in 3.2, is a collection of Perl modules that
    extend the capabilities of the Perl language.

  1.2 System overview

    The 'Tie::Gzip' module provides a file handle Tie for compressing and
    uncompressing files using the gzip format.

    By tieing a filehandle to 'Tie::Gzip' subsequent uses of the file
    subroutines with the tied filehandle will compress data written to an
    opened file using gzip compression and decompress data read from an
    opened file using gzip compression.

    If the 'Tie::Gzip' tie receives a *filename* or *mode filename* after
    completing the tie, 'Tie::Gzip' will open *filename*.

    During the tie, Tie::Gzip will first try to load the 'Compress::Zlib'
    module and package. If successful, 'Tie::Gzip' uses the 'Compress::Zlib'
    for compressing and decompressing the file data.

    If unsuccessful, 'Tie::Gzip' setups up the following pipes to an
    anticipated GNU 'gzip' site command for compressing and decompressing
    the file data:

     gzip --decompress --stdout {} | # read file data
     | gzip --stdout > {} # write file data

    where the string '{}' is a placeholder for the *filename*.

  3.3 Changes

    Changes are as follows

    Tie::Gzip-0.01
        Originated

    Tie::Gzip-0.02
        Installed Mark Scarton's engineering change request per below
        e-mail:

        From: Mark.Scarton@FranklinCovey.com Date: Thu, 19 Feb 2004 17:23:37
        -0700

        In the 'lib/Tie/Gzip.pm' module of the Tie-Gzip-0.01 package, the
        open of the pipe ("gzip --decompress --stdout |") is failing due to
        the reference to $! in the conditional. As a test, I cleared $!
        before issuing the open call as follows:

         Line 124:

                     ###############
                     # Some perls will return a glob and a warning
                     # for certain pipe errors such as the command
                     # not a recognized command
                     #
                     $! = 0;    ### MAS ###
                     my $success = open PIPE, $pipe;
                     if($! || !$success) {
                         warn "Could not pipe $pipe: $!\n";
                         $self->CLOSE;
                         return undef;
                     }

         Line 167:

                     ###############
                     # Some perls will return a glob and a warning
                     # for certain pipe errors such as the command
                     # not a recognized command
                     #
                     $! = 0;    ### MAS ###
                     my $success = open PIPE, $pipe;
                     if($! || !$success) {
                         warn "Could not pipe $pipe: $!\n";
                         $self->CLOSE;
                         return undef;
                     }

        This works. Prior to making this change, test 6 of Gzip.t would
        fail.

        According to the Learning Perl O'Reilly book,

        "But if you use die to indicate an error that is not the failure of
        a system request, don't include $!, since it will generally hold an
        unrelated message left over from something Perl did internally. It
        will hold a useful value only immediately after a failed system
        request. A successful request won't leave anything useful there."

        So $! is only sourced when a system error occurs and it is not
        cleared prior to the call. If no error occurs, the value is
        indeterminate.

    Tie::Gzip-0.03
        prerequisite program because loaded the Data::Secs2 test modules to
        tlib\Test instead of tlib\Data.

    Tie::Gzip-0.04
        The lastest build of Test::STDmaker expects the test library in the
        same directory as the test script. Coordiated with the lastest
        Test::STDmaker by moving the test library from tlib to t/Tie, the
        same directory as the test script and deleting the test library
        File::TestPath program module.

         5 subtests skipped.

        The test script is not right and this is a false failure. The test
        script uses the <Test:Tech> features to force the "ok" and "skip" to
        perform a skip. However, this does not work for Perl code outside
        the "ok" and "skip" subroutines. Added test code to skip outside the
        "ok" and "skip" subroutines.

    Tie::Gzip-0.05
        The distribution "Tie::Gzip-0.04" failed acrossed many systems. Very
        strange since it passes as follows:

         PASSED:

        The failure is real. Placed the ommitted $ in front of gz_package
        and try again.

    Tie::Gzip-0.06
        All the Unix machines are failing as follows:

         Use of uninitialized value in string eq at t/Tie/Gzip.t line 243.
         # Cannot open <gzip0.htm
         Use of uninitialized value in string eq at t/Tie/Gzip.t line 296.
         # Cannot open <gzip0.htm
         FAILED tests 9, 11
                Failed 2/11 tests, 81.82% okay

        The reason is the the test script uses "gzip0.htm" while the
        distribution file is t/Tie/Gzip0.htm. The difference in capitalition
        causes failures on operation system with case sensitive file
        specifitions.

        Change the distribution file to "t/Tie/gzip0.htm". Added steps to
        the beginning of the test scripts to ensure that "t/Tie/Gzip.t" can
        read "gzip0.htm" so that do not have to spent time analyzing what
        went work.
