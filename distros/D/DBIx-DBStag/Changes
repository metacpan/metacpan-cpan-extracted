============

2009-12-14	- miration to github

2010-01-21	- compensated from bug(?) in DBSchema 0.38, where default values of '' were being quoted, resulting in double quoting
		  DBSchema 0.38 also appears to use refs for defaults. DBStag is now neutral w.r.t. version of DBSchema, it derefs if it is a reference.
