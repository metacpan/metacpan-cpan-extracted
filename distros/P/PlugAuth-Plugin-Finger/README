NAME

    PlugAuth::Plugin::Finger - Add a finger protocol interface to your
    PlugAuth server

VERSION

    version 0.02

SYNOPSIS

    In your PlugAuth.conf:

     plugins:
       - PlugAuth::Plugin::Finger:
           port: 8079

    Then from the command line, to list all users/groups:

     % finger @localhost

    and from the command line, to query a user or group:

     % finger foo@localhost

    and to see the granted permissions:

     % finger -l foo@localhost

DESCRIPTION

    This plugin provides a finger protocol interface to PlugAuth. Through
    it you can see the users, groups and their permissions through the
    finger interface.

    By default this plugin will listen to port 79 on Windows, or when the
    user is privileged under Unix. Otherwise it will listen to port 8079.
    Many finger clients cannot be configured to connect to a different
    port, but you can use iptables on Linux, or use an equivalent tool on
    other operating systems to forward port 79 to port 8079.

PLUGIN OPTIONS

 port

    Specify the port. This is will default to 79 or 8079 if you do not
    specify it.

CAVEATS

    This plugin won't work as currently implemented if you are using a
    start_mode which forks, such as hypnotoad. Until that is solved this
    plugin will probably prevent you from scaling your PlugAuth deployment.
