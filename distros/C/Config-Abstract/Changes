0.12 Wed Feb 12 22:12:41 2003
	- Config::Abstract->patch() implemented
	- patch and diff documented as are get and set, the new public mutators
	- inidiff, previously called just diff, has been renamed, to inidiff :), and made slightly
	  more useful
	- test.pl has been changed so it won't fail when deploying. It still does nothing useful,
	  though. Did I hear someone say 'Let me do it!'? Thought not.
	- test.pl in the root directory has been renamed to testdata.pl as that's a more appropriate
	  name. Same goes for test.ini, which is now called testdata.ini
	  
0.11 Tue Feb 11 11:01:38 2003
	- Config::Abstract->diff() now implemented to let us create intelligent diffs from any files
	  supported by this set of modules
	- Introduced path-based namespace for get_entry and set_entry
	- Added CREDITS to the README to give something back to the folks around here who have been
	  instrumental in getting me to the right mindset for getting all this done.
	- Included a small utility script for the Config::Abstract::Ini module that lets you diff two
	  .ini files
	  
0.10 Thu Jan 30 11:08:23 2003
	- Updated test.pl so it will pass submission tests and put some content in README and Changes
	- Removed some obsolete documentation in PODs
