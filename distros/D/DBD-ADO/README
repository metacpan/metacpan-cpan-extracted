NAME

  DBD::ADO - A DBI driver for Microsoft ADO (Active Data Objects)

SYNOPSIS

  use DBI();

  my $dbh = DBI->connect("dbi:ADO:$dsn", $user, $passwd );

DESCRIPTION

  The DBD::ADO module supports ADO access on a Win32 machine. DBD::ADO is
  written to support the standard DBI interface to data sources.

PREREQUISITES

  DBI
  Win32::OLE

  ADO (http://www.microsoft.com/Data/download.htm)

INSTALLATION

  To install this module type the following:

     perl Makefile.PL
     make
     make test
     make install

  You need to use the correct make command. That may be nmake or dmake,
  depending on which development environment you are using.
  If using the Win32 ActiveState build then it is recommended that you
  use the ppm utility to fetch and install the module instead.

TESTING

  The supplied tests will connect to the database using the DBI
  environment variables, e.g.:

    set DBI_DSN=dbi:ADO:File Name=test.udl
    set DBI_DSN=dbi:ADO:Provider=Microsoft.Jet.OLEDB.4.0;Data Source=C:\tmp\test.mdb

  The tests will create tables (or other database objects) with the name
  (or prefix) 'PERL_DBD_TEST' in the current schema.
  Check for the unlikly case that this will cause unwanted side effects!

  To run the tests, type

    make test

  If all tests pass, you'll see something like:

    t\01base.......ok
    t\02ads........ok
    t\02cxn........ok
    t\04os.........ok
        25/45 skipped: various reasons
    ...
    t\51qi.........ok
    All tests successful, 53 subtests skipped.
    Files=29, Tests=737, 122 wallclock secs ...

  It is possible to run individual test scripts, e.g.:

    perl -w -Mblib t\02cxn.t
