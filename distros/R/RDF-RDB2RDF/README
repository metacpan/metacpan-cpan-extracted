NAME
    RDF::RDB2RDF - map relational database to RDF declaratively

SYNOPSIS
     print RDF::RDB2RDF->new(R2RML => $r2rml)->process_turtle($dbh);

DESCRIPTION
    It's quite common to want to map legacy relational (SQL) data to RDF. This
    is usually quite simple to do by looping through database tables and
    spitting out triples. Nothing wrong with that; I've done that in the past,
    and that's what RDF::RDB2RDF does under the hood.

    But it's nice to be able to write your mapping declaratively. This
    distribution provides three modules to enable that:

    *   RDF::RDB2RDF::Simple - map relational database to RDF easily

    *   RDF::RDB2RDF::R2RML - map relational database to RDF using R2RML

    *   RDF::RDB2RDF::DirectMapping - map relational database to RDF directly

    `RDF::RDB2RDF` itself provides a wrapper for constructing mapper objects,
    and acts as a base class for the three implementations.

    There is also a module RDF::RDB2RDF::DirectMapping::Store which uses the
    same mapping as RDF::RDB2RDF::DirectMapping but provides the same
    interface as RDF::Trine::Store.
