NAME

    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Git::RequireUnixEOL - enforce the correct line
    endings in your Git repository with Dist::Zilla

VERSION

    Version 1.001

SYNOPSIS

      # in dist.ini:
      [Git::RequireUnixEOL]

DESCRIPTION

    This plugin checks that all the files in the Git repository where your
    project is saved use Unix line endings and have no whitespace at the
    end of a line. Files not in the Git index are ignored. You can ignore
    additional files with the ignore option in dist.ini.

    The plugin runs in the before build phase and aborts the build if a
    violation is found.

    The plugin should ensure that you always commit your files with the
    correct line endings and without superfluous whitespace.

    This plugin checks the files in your repository. To check your build
    you can use a test based on Test::EOL.
