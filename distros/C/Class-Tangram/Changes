Revision history for Perl extension Class::Tangram

2006-01-31
   o Release 1.57
   o Don't insert accessors if the package can already do that method.

2004-02-23
   o Release 1.56
   o Make sure reference "container methods" always only call their
     set method with one argument.
   o ->set(), ->get(): Allow classes to AUTOLOAD their accessors
                       without redefining ->can()
   o generator test no longer requires Tangram to be installed

2004-02-23
   o Release 1.54.2
   o Added support for Storable, idbif, etc column types.  Mutter to
     self disadvantages of hardcoding Tangram Type list in module.

2004-01-08
   o Release 1.54.1
   o Fixed dire copy constructor bug.

2004-01-01
   o Release 1.54
   o Many fixes for the intermediate classes change below
   o Check functions on setters for collections

2003-10-27
   o Release 1.53
   o Added intermediate classes, so that calling $self->SUPER::get_foo
     works as OO discipline dictates.
   o Removed function prototypes
   o import_schema() will now return immediately if called twice for a
     class

2003-10-27
   o Release 1.52
   o Various minor fixes
   o Major enhancements to the operation of Class::Tangram::Generator.
     `use Class' when `Class' is a part of the Generator now works.

2003-08-12
   o Release 1.51
   o Implements a work-around for Tangram on Perl 5.8.0
   o Now auto-loads Tangram components (Tangram::Type classes) if it
     can
   o Added Class::Tangram::Generator

2003-07-01
   o Release 1.50
   o Container ubiquity (see the README)
   o Companion attributes (explicit back-references)

2002-09-15
   o Release 1.13
   o Scrapped Pod::Constants bullshit
   o some 

2002-05-29
   o Release 1.12
   o Complete removal of AUTOLOAD.  More backwards compatibility than
     1.115
   o Massive documentation simplification and rewording

2002-05-22
   o Release 1.115 (not released publicly)
   o Early changes to make the module more efficient - closures and
     direct symbol table manipulation are used instead of AUTOLOAD.

2002-04-15
   o Release 1.11
   o Minor Bugfix - "iset" default init_default had a typo relating to
     the cleanup.  Should have known it would happen, making releases
     at 2:43am
   o Added test for above bugfix

2002-04-15
   o Release 1.10
   o Added "required" attribute, contributed by Charles Owens
     <owensc@enc.edu>
   o Much cleanup of code, particularly the import_schema function.
   o Removed seemingly superfluous check for tied values of
     init_default attribute option (tied checking is used elsewhere to
     prevent unwanted auto-vivification of attributes, but those
     should never get to init_default, especially since if they did
     they would be effectively useless)
   o Minor enhancements to documentation and Pod::Constants imported
     sections

2002-02-18
   o Release 1.09
   o Bugfix affecting objects with stringify function fixed
   o "transient" type now works in storage properly

2002-02-10
   o Release 1.08
   o Added "transient" type
   o Documentation changes

2002-02-09
   o Release 1.07
   o "array" and "hash" types are now as magical as set types on
     "get()" - that is, if they are undefined, an empty array is
     returned rather than undef.  Also, if evaluated in list context,
     the members of the array are returned in a list rather than a
     reference to the array.
   o Added &YourClass::set_init_default(field => $value)
   o made test suite a bit more complete
   o Removed support for bogus non-existant "time", "timestamp"
     Tangram types
   o Support for "rawdate", "rawtime", "dmdatetime".  This completes
     support for all standard Tangram data types.
   o Class::Tangram classes now pass the "empty sub-class" test

2001-11-21

   o Release 1.06
   o Added run-time type information functions

2001-11-21

   o Release 1.05
   o Some small speed optimisations and bug fixes.
   o Changed Makefile.PL to use Pod::Constants

2001-10-14

   o Release 1.04
   o Added some Set::Object AUTOLOAD functions
   o More documentation fixes
   o Now creates empty Set::Object containers for set attributes so
     that Tangram doesn't get upset when you store a new object, but
     didn't initialise one of its sets.
   o Get of a Set::Object attribute returns its members when called in
     list context

2001-10-10

   o Release 1.03
   o Supressed useless warning that I couldn't work around in
     destructor:
	'(in cleanup) Can't call method "FETCH" on an undefined value
	 at ...'
   o Documentation bugfixes
