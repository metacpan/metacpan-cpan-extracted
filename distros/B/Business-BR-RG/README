DESCRIPTION
    The RG number is an identification number of Brazilian citizens emitted
    by the Department of Public Safety, which is called "Secretaria de
    SeguranÃ§a PÃºblica (SSP)".

    RG stands for "Registro Geral", and it is valid for all brazil
    territory. May be use as passport to Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay and
    Chile.

    The RG is comprised of a base of 8 digits and one check digit.

    It is usually written like '12.002.999-0' so as to be more
    human-readable.

    This module provides "test_rg" for checking that a RG number is
    *correct*. Here a *correct RG number* means

    *   it is 9 digits long

    *   it satisfies the check equation mentioned below

    Before checking, any non-digit letter is stripped, making it easy to
    test formatted entries like '21.002.999-00' and entries with extra
    blanks like ' 99.221.222-00 '. Except the letter X, because it's
    represents the number 10.

    test_rg
                test_rg('39.985.676-X') # incorrect RG, returns 0
                test_rg(' 39.985.676-6 ') # is ok, returns 1
                test_rg('123') # nope, returns undef

        Tests whether a RG number is correct. Before testing, any non-digit
        [except X, no matter its case] character is stripped. Then it is
        expected to be 9 digits long and to satisfy check equation which
        validate the check digit. See "THE CHECK EQUATIONS".

        The policy to get rid of '.' and '-' is very liberal. It indeeds
        discards anything that is not a digit (0, 1, ..., 9, or X) or
        letter. That is handy for discarding spaces as well

                test_rg(' 39.985.676-6 ') # is ok, returns 1

        But extraneous inputs like '3.9.9 8w5.6w7h6?6' are also accepted. If
        you are worried about this kind of input, just check against a
        regex:

                warn "bad RG: only digits (9) expected"
                        unless ($rg =~ /^\d{8}(\d|x)$/i);

                warn "bad RG: does not match mask '__.___.___-_'"
                        unless ($rg =~ /^\d{2}\.\d{3}\.\d{3}-(\d|x)$/i);

        NOTE. Integer numbers like 1234567 with fewer than 8 digits will be
        normalized (eg. to "001234567") before testing.

    canon_rg
                canon_rg(99); # returns '000000099'
                canon_rg('99.999.999-9'); # returns '999999999'

        Brings a candidate for a RG number to a canonical form. In case, the
        argument is an integer, it is formatted to at least 9 digits.
        Otherwise, it is stripped of any non-alphanumeric [again, except x]
        characters and returned as it is.

    format_rg
                format_rg('00000000'); # returns '00.000.000-0'

        Formats its input into '00.000.000-0' mask. First, the argument is
        canon'ed and then dots and hyphen are added to the first 9 digits of
        the result. So you can call format_rg even when its already
        formated.

    parse_rg
                ($base, $dv) = parse_rg($rg);
                $hashref = parse_rg('99.222.111-0'); # { base => '99222111', dv => '0' }

        Splits a candidate for RG number into base and check digits (dv -
        dÃgitos de verificaÃ§Ã£o). It canon's the argument before splitting
        it into 8- and 1-digit parts. In a list context, returns a
        two-element list with the base and the check digits. In a scalar
        context, returns a hash ref with keys 'base' and 'dv' and associated
        values.

    random_rg
                $rand_rg = random_rg($valid);

                $correct_rg = random_rg();
                $rg = random_rg(1); # also a correct RG
                $bad_rg = random_rg(0); # an incorrect RG

        Generates a random RG. If $valid is omitted or 1, it is guaranteed
        to be *correct*. If $valid is 0, it is guaranteed to be *incorrect*.
        This function is intented for mass test. (Use it wisely.)

        The implementation is simple: just generate a 8-digits random
        number, hopefully with a uniform distribution and then compute the
        check digits. If $valid==0, the check digits are computed not to
        satisfy the check equations.

  EXPORT
    "test_rg" is exported by default. "canon_rg", "format_rg", "parse_rg"
    and "random_rg" can be exported on demand.

NAME
    Business::BR::RG - Perl module to test for correct RG numbers

    ABSTRACT:

            use Business::BR::RG;

            print "ok " if test_rg('390.533.447-05'); # prints 'ok '
            print "bad " unless test_rg('231.002.999-00'); # prints 'bad '

    using all methods

            use Business::BR::RG qw /canon_rg test_rg random_rg format_rg parse_rg/;

            test_rg('48.391.390-x') # 1
            canon_rg('11.456.789-x') # '11456789X'

            test_rg('48.190.390-X') # 0

            test_rg('48.190') # undef

            format_rg('48.19.0.3.9.0.X') # '48.190.390-X'

            my ($base, $dv) = parse_rg('48.19.0.3.9.0.X');
            print $base # '48190390'
            print $dv   # 'X'

            my $hashref = parse_rg('48.19.0.3.9.0.X');
            print $hashref->{base} . '-' . $hashref->{dv}; # 48190390-X

THE CHECK EQUATIONS
    A correct RG number has one check digit which are computed from the base
    8 first digits. Consider the RG number written as 9 digits

    c[1] c[2] c[3] c[4] c[5] c[6] c[7] c[8] dv[1]

    To check whether a RG is correct or not, it has to satisfy the check
    equations:

    c[1]*2 + c[2]*3 + c[3]*4 + c[4]*5 + c[5]*6 + c[6]*7 + c[7]*8 + c[8]*9 +
    dv[9] * 100 = 0 (mod 11)

BUGS
    until now I do not found any RG that has less than 8 digits. But, I
    guess, old people still have it. For now, this is the only way that I
    found to check RG. If you found any bug, feel free to send e-mail, open
    an issue on github or open a RT.

SEE ALSO
    Note that this module only tests correctness. It doesn't enter the merit
    whether the RG number actually exists at the Brazilian government
    databases.

    Please reports bugs via CPAN RT or github.
