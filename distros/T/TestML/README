NAME

    TestML - A Generic Software Testing Meta Language

TESTML IS NOT ON CPAN

    TestML works great in Perl (5 and 6) and you can use it to write tests
    for your CPAN modules; but you don't install TestML from CPAN.

    See https://github.com/testml-lang/testml/wiki/TestML-and-CPAN for the
    full details.
