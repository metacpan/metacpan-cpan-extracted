Revision history for Game-Marad

0.07    2023-08-31
        Deprecation dances: change 'has' to 'field', and some warnings foo.

0.06    2022-12-16
        Fix attribute when selecting piece already on score cell.
        Zobrist metadata function added.

0.05    2022-11-11
        Make tricky test author-only. Use less recursion to figure out
        the piece pushing.

0.04    2022-11-08
        Set and document ESCDELAY so hitting escape is not so terribly
        slow. Make the select and cancel actions less bad. Better
        highlight the center scoring square.

        New is_owner method to help with select actions.

0.03    2022-11-08
        Mark the piece selected to move with bold. Remove the turn
        method (a similar cleanup was done in the LISP version). Add a
        size method in the event a client needs the board size.

0.01    2022-11-07
        First version, released on an unsuspecting world.
