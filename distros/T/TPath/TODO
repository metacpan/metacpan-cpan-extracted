 . = still to do
 - = discarded
 * = completed

* add usual escapes inside string literals
. check order of return for various axes against a reliable spec
. make search order configurable -- parents or children first
* move expression-attribute linking to compiler
. allow mathematical expressions as attribute arguments
* fix index predicates *again* to behave more like xpath

Completed TODO items kept around as curios.

* get rid of MooseX::Privacy to speed things up somewhat
* improve error message when expression is unparsable
* clean up tests and add more thorough testing
* allow attribute selectors as well as predicates
* figure out odd warning being emitted by demo code
* add wrap method to forester for use in coercion
* add tag method to forester to reduce coding burden for most adaptations
* add {x,y} style quantifiers
* add =~ as an operand in attribute tests
* create tests for equality measures in attribute tests
* finish documenting equality measures in attribute tests
- remove redundant extended attributes
* make sure there is some cardinality attribute
* allow multi-line expressions with comments
* rename TPath::Test::XOR to TPath::Test::One
* update grammar section of documentation
* die instead of confessing in grammar and compiler
* refactor to use a context object instead of a bunch of parameters
- create a previous context attribute
- allow qname quoting in literals
* fix \p{PosixPunct} issue with v5.10 on BSD
* comb documentation for pre-TPath::Context parameter lists
* document previous:: axis
* allow bare paths in attribute tests
* add math in attribute tests
* add support for autoloading of attributes
* add string concatenation operator
* refactor apply attribute method so that reflection occurs only once
* create logical attributes @some, @one, @none, @all
* fix 5.18 experimental warnings -- no if $] >= 5.018, warnings => "experimental";
* look for and fix stringification bugs
* update TPath grammar and description of predicates
* add optional case insensitivity for tags
* use Dist::Zilla::Plugin::OptionalFeature to suggest Unicode::CaseFolding
- add some discussion of efficiency to documentation
* add prioritization of predicates a la xpath, so there's both //*[1] and (//*)[1]
- add examples
- simplify axis code in forester
- put 'extends' in BEGIN block
* mention Tree::XPathEngine and Class::XPath in SEE ALSO
- confirm index predicates behave identically in tpath and xpath for all common axes
* add adjacent:: family of axes (in the end, just adjacent::)
* add some handling of variables -- @v('foo') or @var('foo')
