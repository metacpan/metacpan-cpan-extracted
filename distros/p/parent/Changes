    ! The diagnostic about inheriting from ourselves was removed.
      It served no own purpose as Perl already warns if we try to
      inherit in a circular way.

      about the warning of inheriting from yourself.
      Fixes RT #66459

0.224  20101031
    . Change assignment @ISA = (@ISA, 'new::class')
      to use push @ISA, 'new::class'
      This should make class creation faster from 5.10 onwards
      and reverts a change made in 2.14. If this is critically slow for you
      and you can't upgrade your version of Perl, use the old way.

0.223  20090901

    + Fixed test failure reported by David Cantrell
    + Ripped out most of the logic. All you can do
      is now specify that the base classes should not
      be loaded from a file via C<-norequire>.
    + 5.004 compatibility restored by Sébastien Aperghis-Tramoni
      (mostly it's the test suite that breaks ...)
