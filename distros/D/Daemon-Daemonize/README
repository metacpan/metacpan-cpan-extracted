NAME
    Daemon::Daemonize - An easy-to-use daemon(izing) toolkit

VERSION
    version 0.0052

SYNOPSIS
        use Daemon::Daemonize qw/ :all /

        daemonize( %options, run => sub {

            # Daemon code in here...

        } )

        # Do some non-daemon stuff here...

    You can also use it in the traditional way, daemonizing the current
    process:

        daemonize( %options )

        # Daemon code in here...

    and use it to check up on your daemon:

        # In your daemon

        use Daemon::Daemonize qw/ :all /

        write_pidfile( $pidfile )
        $SIG{INT} = sub { delete_pidfile( $pidfile ) }

        ... Elsewhere ...

        use Daemon::Daemonize qw/ :all /

        # Return the pid from $pidfile if it contains a pid AND
        # the process is running (even if you don't own it), 0 otherwise
        my $pid = check_pidfile( $pidfile )

        # Return the pid from $pidfile, or undef if the
        # file doesn't exist, is unreadable, etc.
        # This will return the pid regardless of if the process is running
        my $pid = read_pidfile( $pidfile )

DESCRIPTION
    Daemon::Daemonize is a toolkit for daemonizing processes and checking up
    on them. It takes inspiration from
    <http://www.clapper.org/software/daemonize/>, MooseX::Daemon,
    Net::Server::Daemon

  A note about the "close" option
    If you're having trouble with IPC in a daemon, try closing only STD*
    instead of everything:

        daemonize( ..., close => std, ... )

    This is a workaround for a problem with using "Net::Server" and
    "IPC::Open3" in a daemonized process

USAGE
    You can use the following functions in two ways, by either importing
    them:

        use Daemon::Daemonize qw/ daemonize /

        daemonize( ... )

    or calling them as a class method:

        use Daemon::Daemonize

        Daemon::Daemonize->daemonize

  daemonize( %options )
    Daemonize the current process, according to %options:

        chdir <dir>         Change to <dir> when daemonizing. Pass undef for *no* chdir.
                            Default is '/' (to prevent a umount conflict)

        close <option>      Automatically close opened files when daemonizing:

                                1     Close STDIN, STDOUT, STDERR (usually redirected
                                      from/to /dev/null). In addition, close any other
                                      opened files (up to POSIX::_SC_OPEN_MAX)

                                0     Don't close anything

                                std   Only close STD{IN,OUT,ERR} (as in 1)

                            Default is 1 (close everything)

        stdout <file>       Open up STDOUT of the process to <file>. This will override any
                            closing of STDOUT

        stderr <file>       Open up STDERR of the process to <file>. This will override any
                            closing of STDERR

        run <code>          After daemonizing, run the given code and then exit

  read_pidfile( $pidfile )
    Return the pid from $pidfile. Return undef if the file doesn't exist, is
    unreadable, etc. This will return the pid regardless of if the process
    is running

    For an alternative, see "check_pidfile"

  check_pidfile( $pidfile )
    Return the pid from $pidfile if it contains a pid AND the process is
    running (even if you don't own it), and 0 otherwise

    This method will always return a number

  write_pidfile( $pidfile, [ $pid ] )
    Write the given pid to $pidfile, creating/overwriting any existing file.
    The second argument is optional, and will default to $$ (the current
    process number)

  delete_pidfile( $pidfile )
    Unconditionally delete (unlink) $pidfile

  does_process_exist( $pid )
    Using "kill", attempts to determine if $pid exists (is running).

    If you don't own $pid, this method will still return true (by examining
    "errno" for EPERM).

    For an alternative, see "can_signal_process"

  can_signal_process( $pid )
    Using "kill", attempts to determine if $pid exists (is running) and is
    owned (signable) by the user.

  check_port( $port )
    Returns true if $port on the localhost is accepting connections.
