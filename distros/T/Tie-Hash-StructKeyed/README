NAME
    Tie::Hash::StructKeyed - use structures like hashes and arrays as keys
    to a hash

SYNOPSIS
       use Tie::Hash::StructKeyed;
       tie %hash,  'Tie::Hash::StructKeyed';

       $hash{[1,2,3]} = 'Keyed by listref';

       my $h = { one=>1, two=>2 };
       $hash{$h}      = 'Keyed by hashref';

DESCRIPTION
    Tie::Hash::StructKeyed ties a hash so that you can use arrays, hashes or
    complex structures as the key of the hash.

NOTE
    The current implementation uses YAML to generate the hash-key for the
    structure. This is possibly the easiest way to get a powerful and
    flexible key-hashing behaviour.

    It does mean that the behaviour for objects is undefined: Two objects
    with the same representation will hash the same. The same object, after
    an internal state change may hash differently. Behaviour of objects as
    keys (or as part of a key) is subject to change in future versions.
