   Replace SvIV with SvIVX in typemap.
   Remove dXSARGS declaration from autocorrelation_20000(). It's not needed and it
    results in an assertion failure with -DDEBUGGING perls.

   Makefile.PL - Replace the Math::GMP PREREQ_PM with Math::GMPz (and save 20 minutes
                 on the install-time).
   t/bbs.t - improve efficiency of Math::GMPz tests by allocating full number of
             bits to $bitstream & $bitstream_20000 at time of creation. (Rmpz_init2)

   Add metadata to Makefile.PL

   Add autocorrelation_20000 test.

   Add autocorrelation test.

   The poker test appended 0's to the *end* of the bitstring (to compensate for
    missing leading 0's). Change it so that 0's are added to the *beginning* of
    the string, as is strictly correct ... in case it matters.

   Fix bug in runs test.

   Add warning (that provides additional info) to longrun test when it fails.
