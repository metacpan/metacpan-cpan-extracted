Revision history for Perl extension HTML::Entities::Interpolate.

1.10  2016-08-14T11:33:00
	- Stop using Test::Stream. Use Test::More shipped in the Test::Simple distro.
		See RT#116935. Thanx to Chad Granum.
	- Update version #s in pre-reqs.
	- Adopt new repo structure. For details, see
		http://savage.net.au/Ron/html/My.Workflow.for.Building.Distros.html.
	- Update .gitignore and MANIFEST.SKIP.
	- Change licence from Artistic to Perl.
	- Move File::Spec, Test::Pod and Test::Simple to TEST_REQUIRES within Makefile.PL.

1.09  2015-11-29T10:08:00
	- Replace "\t" with \s{4} in scripts/synopsis.pl and t/synopsis.html in an attempt to fix
		the large number of failures reported by CPAN Testers.
	- Patch t/test.t to use File::Spec to join a dir to a file name.
	- Use $^X rather than 'perl' to invoke Perl in t/test.t.
	- Make some pre-req version #s explicit.

1.08  2015-11-26T14:26:00
	- In V 1.07 I patched t/test.t to use Test::Stream instead of Test::More, but did not patch
		Makefile.PL to match. Test::More is still used for xt/author/pod.t.

1.07  2015-11-24T08:47:00
	- Apologies: Forgot to release V 1.06 to CPAN.
	- Add scripts/synopsis.pl and its output t/synopsis.html.
	- Copy scripts/synopsis.pl into docs.
	- Add t/test.t to run scripts/synopsis.pl and compare the output to t/synopsis.html.
	- Update pre-reqs to add Capture::Tiny and File::Slurper, which are used in t/test.t.
	- Add .gitignore to MANIFEST.SKIP.
	- Remove Build.PL.
	- Remove t/load.t.
	- Reformat the dates in this file.

1.06  2015-02-18T16:32:00
	- Add use strict and use warnings to Build.PL and Makefile.PL.
	- Add github repo to Build.PL, Makefile.PL and docs.
	- Move t/pod.t to xt/author/.
	- Patch Build.PL to handle xt/author/*.t.

1.05  2013-07-09T08:56:00
	- No code changes.
	- Rename CHANGES to Changes as per CPAN::Changes::SPEC.
	- Recreate META.* files so they say licence is artistic_2 rather than artistic_1.
		Build.PL and Makefile.PL already said artistic_2, but the META.* files didn't.
		There is no reference to licences in the source of the module itself.
		This was requested by Christopher Meng who packages stuff for Fedora.

1.04  2011-02-15T17:02:00
	- Replace /usr/bin/perl with /usr/bin/env perl.
	- Replace common::sense with use strict and use warnings, to get uninit var warnings.
	- Update MANIFEST.SKIP, MYMETA.json.
	- Add META.json.

1.03  2010-02-21T12:55:15
	- Remove text 'All rights reserved' (for Debian licensing).
	- Remove POD heads 'Required Modules' and 'Changes'.

1.02  2010-02-10T14:02:07
	- MANIFEST.SKIP updated to exclude MYMETA.yml. Add MYMETA.yml.

1.01  2009-11-13T13:20:00
	- Run dos2unix
	- Rename Changes.txt to CHANGES

1.00  2004-11-09T15:30:45
	- Original version
	- Source code author: David Nicol
	- I (Ron Savage) am releasing this module, which David emailed to me,
		because it is a pre-requisite for my module DBIx::Admin
	- This module was recently released under the name HTML::Entitize, but
		I've changed this name so it will be found more easily via CPAN searches.
		The name HTML::Entitize was just a bit too obscure for its own good
