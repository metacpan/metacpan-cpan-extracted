DESCRIPTION

This is the PAR-WebStart distribution, which is a Perl
version of Java's WebStart technology; see
  http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/guide/jws/developersguide/overview.html
for details.

PAR-WebStart is a helper application associated
with a browser. When a user clicks on a link that points to a 
PNLP [PAR Network Launch Protocol] launch file (a special XML file), 
it causes the browser to launch PAR-WebStart, which then 
automatically downloads, caches, and runs the specified
PAR-based application. 

INSTALLATION

Installation proceeds in the usual fashion:

  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test
  make install

The following CPAN modules will be required:

  LWP
  XML::SAX::ExpatXS
  PAR
  Module::Signature
  File::Which
  Archive::Zip

For Win32 (builds 8xx), ppm packages of all necessary prerequisites 
are available from ActiveState's default repository, 
http://www.bribes.org/perl/ppm/, or http://theoryx5.uwinnipeg.ca/ppms/.

After installation, documentation is available for:

  PAR::WebStart: an overview
  PAR::WebStart::PNLP: description of the PNLP file syntax
  PAR::WebStart::Util: some helper utilities
  make_par.pl: a script to make a suitable par archive
  perlws.pl: a script to register as the application to open .pnlp files
  pnlp_registry.pl: a script to add the necessary file association on Win32
  Apache2::WebStart: a mod_perl-2 handler for generating PNLP files

USAGE

An overview of the use is as follows (more details are found in
the embedded pod documentation in the above modules/scripts):

For the server:

- using PAR, make up one (or several) par archives containing necessary
modules for the application. One such archive must have a main.pl
script, which will be run by the client.

- each par file must have an associated file containing the
md5 checksum of the archive. This is a mild check on the
integrity of the downloaded archive, and also will be used
as a test for the client to see if an update for a cached
par file is available. An included script, make_par, can
be used for making up a suitable archive.

- although it's possible to turn this feature off, it's
strongly recommended to sign each archive using Module::Signature.

- place the par files on a server, and make up a PNLP file
describing the application.

For the client:

- install PAR-WebStart, and associate the perlws.pl script
with files with a .pnlp extension (the associated content
type is application/x-perl-pnlp-file). How to do this depends
on the browser and platform. For Win32, this is done through
the registry - a script, pnlp_registry.pl, is included
in this distribution to handle this task.  For linux, with
KDE, for example, one uses the File Associations menu item
under Control Center -> KDE Components to associate the perlws.pl
script with an application/x-perl-pnlp-file (for *.pnlp files), 
or alternatively, right-click a .pnlp file within 
the file explorer window and choose "Edit File Type".

- point your broswer to http://theoryx5.uwinnipeg.ca/hello.pnlp
to test out the installation; after confirming that you do
want to run this application, you should see a few simple
"Hello" messages appearing in a console window (the associated
par and .pnlp files for this application are included in the
ex/ subdirectory of this distribution).

NOTES AND CAVEATS

This is an alpha version; not all features may
work as documented. The specs for the current PNLP files
are subject to change.
