NAME

    Test2::Tools::Rustfmt - Test that bundled Rust code is formatted
    according to Rust style guidelines

VERSION

    version 0.05

SYNOPSIS

     use Test2::V0;
     use Test2::Tools::Rustfmt;
     
     cargo_fmt_ok;
     
     done_testing;

DESCRIPTION

    These test tools work with rustfmt and cargo fmt to ensure that any
    bundled Rust code that you might have in your Perl Rust extension are
    formatted according to the Rust style guidelines.

FUNCTIONS

    Functions are exported by default.

 rustfmt_ok

     rustfmt_ok $file, $test_name;
     rustfmt_ok \@files, $test_name;
     rustfmt_ok $file;
     rustfmt_ok \@files;

    Tests the given rust files to see if they are formatted according to
    the Rust style guidelines.

 cargo_fmt_ok

     cargo_fmt_ok $dir, $test_name;
     cargo_fmt_ok $dir;
     cargo_fmt_ok;

    Tests the rust crate in the given directory to see if they are
    formatted according to the Rust style guidelines. If no directory is
    given, and if a ffi directory exists, then that will be used. This
    works nicely with FFI::Build and FFI::Build::File::Cargo when writing
    Perl extensions in Rust.
