NAME
    MooseX::Deprecated - mark attributes and methods as deprecated

SYNOPSIS
       package Goose
       {
          use Moose;
      
          has feathers => (is => 'ro');
      
          sub honk { say "Honk!" }
      
          with "MooseX::Deprecated" => {
             attributes => [ "feathers" ],
             methods    => [ "honk" ],
          };
       }

DESCRIPTION
    MooseX::Deprecated is a parameterizable role that makes it easy to
    deprecate particular attributes and methods in a class.

    In the SYNOPSIS above, `before` method modifiers will be installed on the
    `feathers` accessor and the `honk` method, issuing a deprecation warning.
    Additionally, an `after` modifier will be installed on the class' `BUILD`
    method which will issue deprecation warnings for any deprecated attributes
    passed to the constructor.

    The warning text will be something along the lines of: "%s is a deprecated
    %s"

    Warnings are issued in the "deprecated" warnings category, so can be
    disabled using:

       no warnings qw( deprecated );

    Warnings can be upgraded to fatal errors with:

       use warnings FATAL => qw( deprecated );

    Warnings will only be issued once per call site.

    When consuming the role you *must* pass either a list of attributes, or a
    list of methods, or both, as parameters to the role. If you forget to do
    so, you'll get an error message like: "%s with no list of attributes or
    methods".

CAVEATS
    To deprecate an attribute, the attribute must actually exist at the time
    you consume this role. In particular, this will not work:

       package Goose
       {
          use Moose;
      
          with "MooseX::Deprecated" => {
             attributes => [ "feathers" ],
          };
      
          has feathers => (is => 'ro');
       }

    Because the "feathers" attribute isn't defined until *after* the role is
    consumed. Attempting the above will die with a nasty error message:
    "Attribute %s does not exist in %s so cannot be deprecated".

    If a deprecated attribute handles any methods via delegation, then calling
    these methods will result in not one, but two warnings. One warning for
    calling the delegated method; the other warning for calling the accessor
    (reader) to obtain the object to delegate to. This could theoretically be
    changed, but I'm comfortable with the existing situation.

    Warnings issued by the accessor (reader) during method delegation come
    from inside your class, and thus the caller cannot disable them or
    fatalize them.

BUGS
    Please report any bugs to
    <http://rt.cpan.org/Dist/Display.html?Queue=MooseX-Deprecated>.

  Perl 5.8
    The behaviour of `warnings::warnif` changed significantly between Perl 5.8
    and 5.10; the location considered to be the effective caller changed from
    being "like `warn`" to being "like `carp`" (the latter being considerably
    more useful). Therefore under Perl 5.8, doing things like `no warnings
    "deprecated"` in your code to control warnings from this role is rather
    useless, because your code is unlikely to be considered to be the caller.

    In the test suite I just skip the complex test that checks for this on
    Perl prior to 5.10, allowing you to install this module without a hitch on
    Perl 5.8. However, you are strongly discouraged from using this module
    with Perl 5.8.

SEE ALSO
    Package::DeprecationManager provides a more powerful and complicated set
    of features. I'm a simple kind of guy, and don't see the need to allow my
    caller to pick and choose which deprecations they'd like to ignore based
    on some API version.

    Attribute::Deprecated is cute, but only deals with methods, and ironically
    not (what Moose calls) attributes.

    Devel::Deprecation has some pretty nice features, but is more manual than
    I'd like, and again only deals with methods.

    Not to be confused with Moose::Deprecated which can be used to manage
    warnings issued by Moose itself.
