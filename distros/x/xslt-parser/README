This is a Perl module to parse XSL Transformational sheets. For a description of 
the XSLT, see http://www.w3.org/ . It uses XML::Parser and XML::DOM.

XML::Parser is a Perl extension interface to James Clark's XML parser, expat.
It requires at least version 5.004 of perl and can be found on CPAN.

XML::DOM is a Perl module that allows XML::Parser to build an Object Oriented datastructure
with a DOM Level 1 compliant interface.

This is an alpha version and the module is not conform the XSLT woking draft at
this moment. We work very hard to make it conform. New releases will be announced
on the perl-xml mailing list. [You can subscribe to
this list by sending a message to subscribe-perl-xml@lyris.activestate.com.]

For bug reports or suggestions send email to (gjosten|egonw)@sci.kun.nl.

To configure this module, cd to the directory that contains this README file
and type the following.

	perl Makefile.PL

Then to build you run make.

	make

If you have write access to the perl library directories, you may then
install by typing (as superuser):
