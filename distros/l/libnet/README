NAME

    libnet - Simple API to the client side of various internet protocols

DESCRIPTION

    libnet is a collection of Perl modules which provides a simple and
    consistent programming interface (API) to the client side of various
    protocols used in the internet community.

    For details of each protocol please refer to the RFC. RFCs can be found in
    various places on the web, for a starting point look at:

        https://www.rfc-editor.org/

    The RFCs implemented in this distribution are:

        Net::FTP        RFC959          File Transfer Protocol
        Net::NNTP       RFC977          Network News Transfer Protocol
        Net::POP3       RFC1939         Post Office Protocol 3
        Net::SMTP       RFC821          Simple Mail Transfer Protocol
        Net::Time       RFC867          Daytime Protocol
        Net::Time       RFC868          Time Protocol

EXAMPLES

    The demos directory does contain a few demo scripts. These should be run
    from the top directory like:

        demos/smtp.self -user my-email-address -debug

    However, I do not guarantee these scripts to work.
