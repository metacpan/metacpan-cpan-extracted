CHANGES IN LAST FEW RELEASES
(listed in reverse cronological order by date and subversion)

   0.01_1
      1/9/03, 4:42 am
      Significant, thorough documentation updates.  Various tweaks applied
      to class methods based on comments from adrianh.

   0.01_0
      12/28/02, 1:54 am
      Even more documentation completed.  Fixed an egregious flaw found in
      two methods:
         Class::OOorNO::myargs()
         Class::OOorNO::myself()

   0.00_9
      12/28/02, 12:45 am
      A little more documentation completed.  Completed move to namespace
      Class::OOorNO from the errantly pre-assigned root namespace of OOorNO.

   0.00_8
      12/27/02, 5:50 pm
      Much documentation has been added.  Various methods have been corrected
      to use a much stricter policy for determining whether or not a given
      method was called in OO or procedural style.  More in-depth discussion
      regarding this issue is covered in the new documentation.

   0.00_7
      12/27/02, 11:08 am
      Method Class::OOorNO::shave_opts() now uses UNIVERSAL::isa() rather than
      CORE::ref() to check for an array ref as it should have in the beginning.

   0.00_6
      12/23/02, 2:01 pm
      Miscellaneous optimizations

   0.00_5
      12/23/02, 2:47 am
      Initial release of Class::OOorNO.pm
