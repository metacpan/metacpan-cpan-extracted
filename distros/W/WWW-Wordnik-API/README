DESCRIPTION
    This module implements version 4.0 of the Wordnik API
    (<http://developer.wordnik.com/api>). It provides a simple
    object-oriented interface with methods named after the REST ones
    provided by Wordnik. You should therefore be able to follow their
    documentation only and still work with this module.

    At this point, this module builds request URIs and ship them out as GET
    methods to LWP::UserAgent. Response headers are checked for error codes
    (specifically, throw exception on headers anything other than 2/3xx).
    Response data is not post-processed in any way, other than optionally
    being parsed from "JSON" to "Perl" data structures. Data::Dumper should
    be of help there.

INTERFACE
  CLASS METHODS
    new(%args)
            my %args = (
                server_uri => 'http://api.wordnik.com/v4',
                api_key    => 'your key',
                version    => '4',
                format     => 'json', # json | xml | perl
            );

            my $WN = WWW::Wordnik::API->new(%args);

  SELECTOR METHODS
    All selector methods can be assigned to, or retrieved from, as follows:

        $WN->method($value) # assign
        $WN->method         # retrieve

    server_uri()
    server_uri($uri)
        Default $uri: <http://api.wordnik.com/v4>

    api_key()
    api_key($key)
        Required $key: Your API key, which can be requested at
        <http://api.wordnik.com/signup/>.

    version()
    version($version)
        Default $version: *4*. This module supports API version 3 and 4
        (default).

    format()
    format($format)
        Default $format: *json*. Other accepted formats are *xml* and
        *perl*.

    cache()
    cache($cache)
        Default $cache: *10*. Number of requests to cache. Deletes the
        oldest request if cache fills up.

    debug()
    debug($debug)
        Default $debug: *0*. Don't sent GET requests to Wordnik. Return the
        actual request as a string.

  OBJECT METHODS
    word($word, %args)
        This returns the word you requested, assuming it is found in our
        corpus. See <http://docs.wordnik.com/api/methods#words>.

        $word is the word to look up. %args accepts:

        Default "useSuggest": *false*. Return an array of suggestions, if
        available.

        Default "literal": *true*. Return non-literal matches.

        If the suggester is enabled, you can tell it to return the best
        match with "useSuggest=true" and "literal=false".

    phrases($word, %args)
        You can fetch interesting bi-gram phrases containing a word. The
        "mi" and "wlmi" elements refer to "mutual information" and "weighted
        mutual information" and will be explained in detail via future blog
        post. See <http://docs.wordnik.com/api/methods#phrases>.

        $word is the word to look up. %args accepts:

        Default "count": *5*. Specify the number of results returned.

    definitions($word, %args)
        Definitions for words are available from Wordnik's keying of the
        Century Dictionary and parse of the Webster GCIDE. The Dictionary
        Model XSD is available in
        <http://github.com/wordnik/api-examples/blob/master/docs/dictionary.
        xsd> in GitHub. See
        <http://docs.wordnik.com/api/methods#definitions>.

        $word is the word to look up. %args accepts:

        Default "count": *5*. Specify the number of results returned.

        Default "partOfSpeech": *empty*. Specify one or many part-of-speech
        types for which to return definitions. Pass multiple types as an
        array reference.

        The available partOfSpeech values are:

            [noun, verb, adjective, adverb, idiom, article, abbreviation, preposition, prefix, interjection, suffix]

    examples($word)
        You can retrieve 5 example sentences for a words in Wordnik's alpha
        corpus. Each example contains the source document and a source URL,
        if it exists. See <http://docs.wordnik.com/api/methods#examples>.

        $word is the word to look up.

    related($word, %args)
        You retrieve related words for a particular word. See
        <http://docs.wordnik.com/api/methods#relateds>.

        $word is the word to look up. %args accepts:

        Default "type": *empty*. Return one or many relationship types. Pass
        multiple types as an array reference.

        The available type values are:

            [synonym, antonym, form, hyponym, variant, verb-stem, verb-form, cross-reference, same-context]

    frequency($word)
        You can see how common particular words occur in Wordnik's alpha
        corpus, ordered by year. See
        <http://docs.wordnik.com/api/methods#freq>.

        $word is the word to look up.

    punctuationFactor($word)
        You can see how common particular words are used with punctuation.
        See <http://docs.wordnik.com/api/methods#punc>.

        $word is the word to look up.

    suggest($word, %args)
        The autocomplete service gives you the opportunity to take a word
        fragment (start of a word) and show what other words start with the
        same letters. The results are based on corpus frequency, not static
        word lists, so you have access to more dynamic words in the
        language. See <http://docs.wordnik.com/api/methods#auto>.

        $word is the word to look up. %args accepts:

        Default "count": *5*. Specify the number of results returned.

        Default "startAt": *0*. You can also specify the starting index for
        the results returned. This allows you to paginate through the
        matching values.

    wordoftheday
        You can fetch Wordnik's word-of-the day which contains definitions
        and example sentences. See
        <http://docs.wordnik.com/api/methods#wotd>.

    randomWord(%args)
        You can fetch a random word from the Alpha Corpus. See
        <http://http://developer.wordnik.com/docs>.

        %args accepts:

        Default "hasDictionaryDef": *true*. You can ask the API to return
        only words where there is a definition available.

CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT
    WWW::Wordnik::API requires no configuration files or environment
    variables.

DEPENDENCIES
    This module requires the core modules "Test::More", "version" and
    "Carp", and "LWP::UserAgent" from "CPAN". Additionally, it
    recommends-requires "JSON" from "CPAN" for getting data in Perl data
    structures.

INCOMPATIBILITIES
    None reported.

BUGS AND LIMITATIONS
    On versions 0.0.1 and 0.0.2, creation of a second object would clobber
    the first object's instance variables, resulting in unexpected
    behaviour. This is fixed in 0.0.3.

    Response data is not post-processed in any way, other than optionally
    being parsed from "JSON" to "Perl" data structures. Data::Dumper should
    be of help there.

    Please report any bugs or feature requests to
    "bug-www-wordnik-api@rt.cpan.org", or through the web interface at
    <http://rt.cpan.org>.

TODO
    Post-processing
        Add filtering methods on response data.

    Implement WWW::Wordnik::API::Response class to handle the above
