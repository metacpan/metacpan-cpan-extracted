 [00 Minor]
 - No signficant changes in the code, but potententially significant packaging changes downstream may care about.

 [01 Version Scheme Change]
 - Mantissa is moving from 8 to 6 to standardise.
 - This is the primary reason for 1.xxx as 0.xxxx is unambiguously smaller than 1.xxx

 [02 Toolkit Change]
 - ExtUtils::MakeMaker is now used instead of Module::Build
 - Tooling and Testing modules only now depend on the minimum required
 - and the "Latest" versions as per myself are only recommended upgrades.

 [Bugfix]
 - Handle some odd cases that turn up when you're working with scary deep nested code.

   triggering code triggering emulate phase )
 - Prereq collector now has a plugins() method that returns an empty array ref.
 - Can now actually bootstrap if deps are updated.

 [Features]
 - The warning diagnostic call that triggers when plugins call '_share_dir_map' from register_plugins  has been
   special-cased with a white-list so that no errors are produced for the MakeMaker plugin and everything else will
   Carp fatally. Hopefully this doesn't prove a problem for anyone.

 - METAData updated for GitHub

0.01003312 2010-12-05T14:48:13Z
 - Permit MakeMaker to call zilla->_share_dir_map on our shadow-zilla during pre-req collection. It should preferably
   be avoided, but this is needed for now to make it work. ( Reported by Apocalypse on IRC ).

0.01000515 2010-11-08T17:06:39Z
 - Depend on newer Test::Simple because subtest() can work wrong without it.
 - Depend on newer Util::Test::KENTNL
