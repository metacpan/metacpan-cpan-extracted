=head1 all_entities_ContigChunk

Return all instances of the ContigChunk entity.

ContigChunks are strings of DNA thought of as being a string in a 4-character alphabet
with an associated ID.  We allow a broader alphabet that includes U (for RNA) and
the standard ambiguity characters.
The notion of ContigChunk was introduced to avoid transferring/manipulating
huge contigs to access small substrings.  A ContigSequence is formed by
concatenating a set of one or more ContigChunks.  Thus, ContigChunks are the
basic units moved from the database to memory.  Their existence should be
hidden from users in most circumstances (users are expected to request
substrings of ContigSequences, and the Kbase software locates the appropriate
ContigChunks).


Example:

    all_entities_ContigChunk -a 

would retrieve all entities of type ContigChunk and include all fields
in the entities in the output.

=head2 Related entities

The ContigChunk entity has the following relationship links:

=over 4
    
=item IsSectionOf ContigSequence


=back


=head2 Command-Line Options

=over 4

=item -a

Return all fields.

=item -h

Display a list of the fields available for use.

=item -fields field-list

Choose a set of fields to return. Field-list is a comma-separated list of 
strings. The following fields are available:

=over 4

=item sequence

=back    
   
=back

=head2 Output Format

The standard output is a tab-delimited file. It consists of the input
file with an extra column added for each requested field.  Input lines that cannot
be extended are written to stderr.
