NAME
    "Text::Ngramize" - Computes lists of n-grams from text.

SYNOPSIS
      use Text::Ngramize;
      use Data::Dump qw(dump);
      my $ngramizer = Text::Ngramize->new (normalizeText => 1);
      my $text = "This sentence has 7 words; doesn't it?";
      dump $ngramizer-> (text => \$text);

DESCRIPTION
    "Text::Ngramize" is used to compute the list of n-grams derived from the
    bytes, characters, or words of the text provided. Methods are included
    that provide positional information about the n-grams computed within
    the text.

CONSTRUCTOR
  "new"
      use Text::Ngramize;
      use Data::Dump qw(dump);
      my $ngramizer = Text::Ngramize->new (normalizeText => 1);
      my $text = ' To be.';
      dump $ngramizer->getListOfNgrams (text => \$text);
      # dumps:
      # ["to ", "o b", " be", "be "]

    The constructor "new" has optional parameters that set how the n-grams
    are computed. "typeOfNgrams" is used to set the type of tokens used in
    the n-grams, "normalizeText" is used to set normalization of the text
    before the tokens are extracted, and "ngramWordSeparator" is the
    character used to join n-grams of words.

    "typeOfNgrams"
         typeOfNgrams => 'characters'

        "typeOfNgrams" sets the type of tokens to extract from the text to
        form the n-grams: 'asc' indicates the list of ASC characters
        comprising the bytes of the text are to be used, 'characters'
        indicates the list of characters are to be used, and 'words'
        indicates the words in the text are to be used. Note a word is
        defined as a substring that matches the Perl regular expression
        '\p{Alphabetic}+', see perlunicode for details. The default is
        'characters'.

    "sizeOfNgrams"
         sizeOfNgrams => 3

        "sizeOfNgrams" holds the size of the n-grams that are to be created
        from the tokens extracted. Note n-grams of size one are the tokens
        themselves. "sizeOfNgrams" should be a positive integer; the default
        is three.

    "normalizeText"
         normalizeText => 0

        If "normalizeText" evalutes to true, the text is normalized before
        the tokens are extracted; normalization proceeds by converting the
        text to lower case, replacing all non-alphabetic characters with a
        space, compressing multiple spaces to a single space, and removing
        any leading space but not a trailing space. The default value of
        "normalizeText" is zero, or false.

    "ngramWordSeparator"
          ngramWordSeparator => ' '

        "ngramWordSeparator" is the character used to separate token-"words"
        when forming n-grams from them. It is only used when "typeOfNgrams"
        is set to 'words'; the default is a space. Note, this is used to
        avoid having n-grams clash, for example, with bigrams the word pairs
        'a aaa' and 'aa aa' would produce the same n-gram 'aaaa' without a
        space separating them.

METHODS
  "getTypeOfNgrams"
    Returns the type of n-grams computed as a string, either 'asc',
    'characters', or 'words'.

      use Text::Ngramize;
      use Data::Dump qw(dump);
      my $ngramizer = Text::Ngramize->new ();
      dump $ngramizer->getTypeOfNgrams;
      # dumps:
      # "characters"

  "getSizeOfNgrams"
    Returns the size of n-grams computed.

      use Text::Ngramize;
      use Data::Dump qw(dump);
      my $ngramizer = Text::Ngramize->new ();
      dump $ngramizer->getSizeOfNgrams;
      # dumps:
      # 3

  "getListOfNgrams"
    The function "getListOfNgrams" returns an array reference to the list of
    n-grams computed from the text provided or the list of tokens provided
    by "listOfTokens".

    "text"
          text => ...

        "text" holds the text that the tokens are to be extracted from. It
        can be a single string, a reference to a string, a reference to an
        array of strings, or any combination of these.

    "listOfTokens"
          listOfTokens => ...

        Optionally, if "text" is not defined, then the list of tokens to use
        in forming the n-grams can be provided by "listOfTokens", which
        should point to an array reference of strings.

    An example using the method:

      use Text::Ngramize;
      use Data::Dump qw(dump);
      my $ngramizer = Text::Ngramize->new (typeOfNgrams => 'words', normalizeText => 1);
      my $text = "This isn't a sentence.";
      dump $ngramizer->getListOfNgrams (text => \$text);
      # dumps:
      # ["this isn t", "isn t a", "t a sentence"]
      dump $ngramizer->getListOfNgrams (listOfTokens => [qw(aa bb cc dd)]);
      # dumps:
      # ["aa bb cc", "bb cc dd"]

  "getListOfNgramsWithPositions"
    The function "getListOfNgramsWithPositions" returns an array reference
    to the list of n-grams computed from the text provided or the list of
    tokens provided by "listOfTokens". Each item in the list returned is of
    the form "['n-gram', starting-index, n-gram-length]"; the starting index
    and n-gram length are relative to the unnormalized text. When
    "typeOfNgrams" is 'asc' the index and length refer to bytes, when
    "typeOfNgrams" is 'characters' or 'words' they refer to characters.

    "text"
          text => ...

        "text" holds the text that the tokens are to be extracted from. It
        can be a single string, a reference to a string, a reference to an
        array of strings, or any combination of these.

    "listOfTokens"
          listOfTokens => ...

        Optionally, if "text" is not defined, then the list of tokens to use
        in forming the n-grams can be provided by "listOfTokens", which
        should point to an array reference where each item in the array is
        of the form "[token, starting-position, length]", where
        "starting-position" and "length" are integers indicating the
        position of the token.

    An example using the method:

      use Text::Ngramize;
      use Data::Dump qw(dump);
      my $ngramizer = Text::Ngramize->new (typeOfNgrams => 'words', normalizeText => 1);
      my $text = " This  isn't a  sentence.";
      dump $ngramizer->getListOfNgramsWithPositions (text => \$text);
      # dumps:
      # [
      #   ["this isn t", 1, 11],
      #   ["isn t a", 7, 7],
      #   ["t a sentence", 11, 13],
      # ]

  "getListOfNgramHashValues"
    The function "getListOfNgramHashValues" returns an array reference to
    the list of integer hash values computed from the n-grams of the text
    provided or the list of tokens provided by "listOfTokens". The advantage
    of using hashes over strings is that they take less memory and are
    theoretically faster to compute. With strings the time to compute the
    n-grams is proportional to their size, with hashes it is not since they
    are computed recursively. Also, the amount of memory used to store the
    n-gram strings grows proportional to their size, with hashes it does
    not. The disadvantage lies with hashing collisions, but these will be
    very rare. However, for small n-gram sizes hash values may take more
    time to compute since all code is written in Perl.

    "text"
          text => ...

        "text" holds the text that the tokens are to be extracted from. It
        can be a single string, a reference to a string, a reference to an
        array of strings, or any combination of these.

    "listOfTokens"
          listOfTokens => ...

        Optionally, if "text" is not defined, then the list of tokens to use
        in forming the n-grams can be provided by "listOfTokens", which
        should point to an array reference of strings.

    An example using the method:

      use Text::Ngramize;
      use Data::Dump qw(dump);
      my $ngramizer = Text::Ngramize->new (typeOfNgrams => 'words', normalizeText => 1);
      my $text = "This isn't a sentence.";
      dump $ngramizer->getListOfNgramHashValues (text => \$text);
      # NOTE: hash values may vary across computers.
      # dumps:
      # [
      #   "4038955636454686726",
      #   "5576083060948369410",
      #   "6093054335710494749",
      # ]  dump $ngramizer->getListOfNgramHashValues (listOfTokens => [qw(aa bb cc dd)]);
      # dumps:
      # ["7326140501871656967", "5557417594488258562"]

  "getListOfNgramHashValuesWithPositions"
    The function "getListOfNgramHashValuesWithPositions" returns an array
    reference to the list of integer hash values and n-gram positional
    information computed from the text provided or the list of tokens
    provided by "listOfTokens". Each item in the list returned is of the
    form "['n-gram-hash', starting-index, n-gram-length]"; the starting
    index and n-gram length are relative to the unnormalized text. When
    "typeOfNgrams" is 'asc' the index and length refer to bytes, when
    "typeOfNgrams" is 'characters' or 'words' they refer to characters.

        "starting-position" and "length" are integers indicating the
        position of the token.

      dump $ngramizer->getListOfNgramHashValuesWithPositions (text => \$text);
      # NOTE: hash values may vary across computers.
      # dumps:
      # [
      #   ["4038955636454686726", 1, 11],
      #   ["5576083060948369410", 7, 7],
