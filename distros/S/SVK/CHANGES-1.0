[Changes for 1.08 - 30 Jun 2006]

* Fix a bug that stalled schedule entries confusing merge to schedule
  entries for replace rather than add, which then makes revert fail.

* report_copath now reports '.' for the anchor.

* Don't die in svk mkdir when make_path returns undef, which means the
 directory is already there.

* Fix warnings about "Use of uninitialized value in array element"
  when doing various "svk help command".

* Dependency fixes.

[Changes for 1.07 - 25 Feb 2006]

  the file contents in some cases.  This caused the checkout to
  contain changes reverting what is in the repository.

  non-canonical paths.

* Typo fixes in error message. [mb]

[Changes for 1.05 - 6 Oct 2005]

* Make use of the new svn API (fs_closest_copy) when available. This
  boosts performance for smerge, switch and info.

* Performance boost by re-implementation of SVN::Mirror::has_local.

* Fixed the case that "svk up" doesn't do the right thing when running
  for a subdirectory of a checkout that has gone in the target
  revision.

  doing push.

* Documentation update on "mv -p", switches "--parent", "--quiet" etc.

* Stream is properly closed to avoid svn-trunk segfault.

* A command line completion script is added into contrib/.

* A script available in contrib/svkopendiff enables svk diff to use
  FileMerge to display output.

[Changes for 1.04 - 24 Aug 2005]

* Fix various locking bugs exposed by the concurrency fix introduced
  in 1.03.  This includes "svk mv A B" not scheduling A for deletion,
  "svk cp -p" not scheduling newly created parent directories for
  addition.

* Use tab characters as the separators between path, depot path and
  label in diff output.  This behaviour conforms to the output of
  Subversion and GNU diff.

[Changes for 1.03 - 18 Aug 2005]

* "svk status" now accepts a --verbose (-v) switch which functions
  just like the svn clients switch of the same name.

* Fix a bug in merge editor for replaced items being deleted but not
  replaced.

  cause checkout_delta to cache its signature, and thus not reported
  as obstructed for the second time.

* Fix a regression that svk sm -l (without -m or --template) should
  prompt for log message.

* Be more carefull handling failures when writing out statefile.

* Fix an issue with concurrent svk storing their own state.

[Changes for 1.02 - 2 Aug 2005]

* "svk mirror" now supports moving mirror points with "svk mv".

* "svk co" now resumes checkouts from where it left off if it gets
  interrupted mid-way.

* "svk commit", "svk smerge" and other commands that accept commit
  messages now accept a --template option, to provide a customised file
  for commit messages.

* SVK's documentation is now up to date with the "svk reference"
  section of the work-in-progress SVK book.

* "Silent errors" from output of subversion repository hooks are
  now reported.

  due to a 'svn:ignore' property or rule.

* "svk describe" accepts the "r12345" revision number form, for ease
  of use.

  files in the working copy).

  only to "svk merge" are no longer printed by "svk update".

* Make "svk revert" work in a few cases where it didn't before, with
  moved files in the working copy.

* "svk ci --import" now replace symlinks with files properly.

* "svk mv" is now more careful about making sure that the target path
  exists.

* "svk rm" across multiple depot paths could cause svk to hang.

* "svk propset" now works directly on mirrored paths.

* Various commands that would silently ignore excess arguments now
  raise errors.

* Specifying a revision for "svk propset" and "svk propedit" commands
  is now correctly disallowed on checkout paths.

* Using "svk smerge" without all of your mirrored paths up to date
  would try to merge too much if you merged components from those
  out-of-date paths.  This has been fixed.

* Various cosmetic fixes to make svk output more precise, for
  scriptability purposes.  This was mostly centred around removal of
  spurious blank lines.

* A memory leak fix with "svk smerge".

* UTF-8 workarounds for buggy versions of Encode.pm.

  result in inconsistent mirror state.

  message if you are not using utf8. [Jorge Daza <jorge@drqueue.org>]

* Fix a crash bug when switch to a branch that has new files with keywords.

* When checkout to existing directory, if the directory is from the
  very same depotpath, do an update instead of dying.  This resembles
  the svn and cvs behaviour.

* Fix patch list/view/dump/delete for those can't be applied. [Jody Belka]

* Fix svk checkout --detach to detach a checkout even if the directory's
  parent no longer exists. [Jody Belka]

* svk checkout --list now shows removed checkout with '?', and
  supports --purge.  [David Glasser]

* Fix a bug that a file is not properly handled when a symlink is
  overwritten by file, without proper replace.

* Fix a bug that patch --apply thinks the commit fails and save the
  commit message to a temp file.

* svk blame now takes --remoterev to show remote revision.

* svk sync -a now does the right thing on given depotpath. [Jody Belka]

* make svk update, ls, and cat use new revspec parser so they support

  checkout which is not HEAD.

* Fix an edge case in post-commit checkout optimization on deleted
  entry.  This was causing stacktrace and not updating the checkout
  metadata accordingly.

* Only consider a g-merge to be a change when the merge source and destination
  paths are the same.  This eliminates empty revisions created by
  push. [matthewd]

* Improve the "Depot path" information, display the full path inside
  the repository instead of the checkout-point. [gugod]

* make sure $ENV{SVKPAGER} refers to an executable. [gugod]
