Revision history for Perl extension Win32::File::VersionInfo.

0.07  Fri May 13 19:08:00 2016
        - Changed Makefile.PL to copy the VersionInfo.xs file out of the xs
          directory rather than messing with XS to try and compile it - since
          that doesn't work!
        - Ran perltidy over everything.
        - Changed README to Markdown (README.md)
        - Added Travis build status to README.md

0.06  Fri May 13 09:06:00 2016
        - Moved XS component out of the root, added conditional compilation
          to avoid build failures on non-Win32 systems.
        - Modified module to throw exception on non-Win32 systems (since the 
          API won't be there).
        - Updated tests to pass on non-Win32 systems, checking that the exception
          is being thrown.
