NAME
    Getopt::CallingName - Script duties delegation based upon calling name

SYNOPSIS
     use Getopt::CallingName;
     call_name(
               name_prefix => 'tv_',
               args        => \@my_array,
               );

DESCRIPTION
    Sometimes you can have a script that can run in two or more 'modes' of
    operation. Apart from an option to specify the mode, the command line
    options are the same/very similar. Much of the code used by the various
    modes is common.

    As an application user interface decision, it may be more useful/helpful
    to be able to call the script by two or more names - i.e. one for each
    mode. This cuts out the command line option for specifying the mode.

    In some cases it might be appropriate just to move all the code, or at
    least all the common code, into a module and have separate wrapper perl
    scripts. The problem with this approach is either you end up duplicating
    command line option handling in each of the wrapper scripts or you end
    up moving the command line option handling into a module also. The
    former case introduces maintenance burden [or perhaps an excuse to use
    TT2 to generate your wrappers ;-)]. The latter case can feel like a
    distortion/displacement of the code.

    Getopt::CallingName provides another alternative. The idea is that you
    create symbolic links to your actual script (which you might want to
    give a generic name). Each symbolic link corresponds to the name/mode
    with which you call the script. Within your script, after any common
    setup/options handling you call subroutine call_name to call the
    appropriate script subroutine for the mode.

PUBLIC INTERFACE
  Public Class Methods
   call_name
     call_name(
                args          => $ra_args,
                name_prefix   => $name_prefix,
                method_prefix => $method_prefix,
                method_suffix => $method_suffix,
               )

    call_name accepts the following optional arguments:

      method_prefix - string to prepend to the calculated method name

      method_suffix - string to append to the calculated method name

      name_prefix - string to chop off the front  of the script name when calculating
                   the method  name.  Useful if all  your  modes have a common
                   prefix (tv_record, tv_play ...)

      args         - reference to an array which should be passed to the called sub.

    call_name returns whatever the called subroutine returns.

    call_name checks the subroutine it is going to call to ensure it exists.
    If it does not exist, call name throws an 'exception' using Carp::croak.

INTERNALS
  Private Class Methods
   _get_name
     _get_name(
                name_prefix   => $name_prefix,
                method_prefix => $method_prefix,
                method_suffix => $method_suffix,
               )

    Returns the $PROGRAM_NAME after removing any path, prefix (optional) and
    extension. Adds and optional method prefix and/or suffix as specified.

INSTALLATION
    To install this module type the following:

       perl Makefile.PL
       make
       make test
       make install

DEPENDENCIES
    This module works only with perl v5.6 and higher. I am more than happy
    to backport to an earlier perl 5.x if someone using an old perl would
    like to make use of my module. Mail me and ask me to do the work [or
    even better do it yourself and send in a patch! ;-)]

    This module requires these other modules and libraries:

     Carp
     Test::More

    The first is required for its operation. The second is for testing
    purposes

    This module has these optional dependencies:

     File::Find::Rule
     Test::Pod (0.95 or higher)

    These are both just requried for testing purposes.

POSSIBLE ENHANCEMENTS
    *   Add a more general method name translation hook
