Version 0.3001: Mon Jun 6 2005
- Fixed a bug in program type reporting

Version 0.3000: Sun Feb 6 2005
- Changed the semantics of non-interactive mode so that it always converts
  relative program names to absolute and validates them.
- Removed Get_GNU_Grep_Version and others. (Just use Get_GNU_Version instead.)
- Checks that the user provides an argname now.
- Improved the documentation

Version 0.2000: Tue Dec 21 2004
- Fixed version numbers, which were incompatible with some modules. (Thanks to
  Tassilo von Parseval <tassilo.von.parseval@rwth-aachen.de> for the bug
  report)
- Program locations are taken from %Config if they exist
- Added some new version functions (GNU make and g++)
- Improved dialogs so that they show which version(s) of the program that
  we're looking for.
- Added a feature to force the use of an invalid program, if the user
  specifies it twice in a row. This will prevent infinite loops in automated
  testing. (Thanks to Barbie <barbie@missbarbell.co.uk> for bug report)

Version 0.10.2:
- Fixed a bug where the default program would not be tried if the value from
  %Config failed.
- Fixed a bug in the documentation about including the module, and fixed the
  Get_...Version functions so that they will be automatically and implicitly
  invoked by Module::Install

- Fixed auto-import of dependencies for this extension

Version 0.10.0: Wed Sep 15 2004
