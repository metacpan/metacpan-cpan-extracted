.105
  - corrected horizontal banding problem in gel noise types

.104
  - square and sgel types now consume -persist arg (like multires)
  - added xscale/yscale args for stretching noise along either axis
  - shadow/emboss not upsampled anymore, due to looking bad
  - "lumber" type output was broken; fixed
  - "simplex2" type was using forced tiling, this was wrong; fixed

.103
  - will now use upsampled lower res noise by default. this is
    "about as good" in most cases, but renders much faster.
  - to disable upsampling (aka to render at natural image resolution),
    use -quality N+, eg "-quality 2+". current max is 3+. see docs
    regarding "quality" arg.
  - several effects like shadow and linear blur are now upsampled from
    lower resolution for performance
  - using -sphere will now create output as a 2:1 rectangular image
  - will now create output as a single-channel file, unless -clut
    was specified
  - removed noisemaker internal functions from perldoc
  - pruned optional exports to a single function, make()
  - changed -workdir to -outdir, which makes more sense

.102
  - noisemaker now consumes *way* less memory (thx Tie::CArray!)
  - added worley, wgel, gradient noise types (see docs/help)
  - removed voronoi type, is about the same as using "-type worley -nth 0"
  - added "-quality" arg to control smooth, interp, and grow
  - default "-interp" changed from cosine to linear. use "-quality"
  - misnomered "perlin" type renamed to "multires"
  - improved gel noise
  - tiling for non-seamless noise works better now
  - simplified help screens

.101
  - Increased default octave count, tweaked other defaults
  - Turned delta, chiral, stereo into post-processing options
  - Added -interp noise arg for specifying interpolation function
  - Added -grow noise arg for specifying upsampling function
  - Replaced "complex" with refined "terra" type
  - Added simplex and simplex2 types
  - Changed default slice type/basis func back to white noise
  - Changed false spheremap recipe, more convincing than ever

.100
  - Removed Math::Random::Brownian types for now, since the dependency
    was limiting the number of supported platforms

.099_001
  - Added canvas type
  - Updated dependency versions in Makefile.PL

.015
  - Added multi-res types: lumber, wormhole, flux
  - Added smoothing step for square noise (sparkle looks nicer too)
  - Misc cleanup and fixes
  - Changed licensing to Perl's

.014
  - Doc updates with links to example images
  - Added julia, newton types
  - Added brownian/gaussian noise types via Math::Random::Brownian

.013
  - Added File::Tempdir as a dep in Makefile.PL

.012
  - Rename flame to fflame, tweaked function
  - Tidied code+docs, update SYNOPSIS
  - Add stereo map (thx jhewitt)
  - mandel + dmandel output is now supersampled
  - Tweaked dmandel interestingness criteria
  - Rename to Math::Fractal::Noisemaker
  - Tweak DLA seeding
  - Re-wrote ex/make-samples as t/Noisemaker.t; accepts args

.011
  - Fixes for ridged, shadow, displace

.010
  - Added fur, dmandel, diffusion, flame, infile, intile,
    spiral, voronoi, moire, textile, delta, chiral types
  - Removed rgel, it was too close to pgel
  - Even more futzing with spheremaps, poles conform better now
  - Smoothed input for gel noise
  - Code cleanup

.009
  - Added wavelet, mandel, buddha, fern functions

.008
  - Add missing POD header

.007
  - Added traditional smoothed noise source for Perlin
  - Many new options for combining noise sources
  - New noise types: ridged multifractal and "gel" types
  - Added some simple color mapping options
  - More futzing with spheremap scaling
  - Added gappiness option (ie for starfields)
  - Tweaked defaults for about 500 reasonable complex noise presets
  - Rewrote POD

.006
  - Added a script to generate lots of example noise
  - Tweaked scale at polar regions to more closely match look of equator
  - Refractive spheremaps should look better

.005
  - Added spheremap option! They're fake but good.
  - Added refractive palette option, looks like fractals
  - Fixed bug with size of output images, was off by one in smooth function
  - Added $QUIET option
  - Allow negative feather vals for cool effects
  - Complex noise now skips an un-needed smoothing step
  - Tweaked default args

.004
  - Added example images to ex/ dir and inline with pod

Sep 2009: .001
  - Initial release
