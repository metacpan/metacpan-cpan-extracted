Organized according to how soon I think I will implement these.

** REWRITE **
    - Next Net::SFTP::Foreign will support either redirecting output to
      /dev/null or a "quiet" option. This should be used.

* Upcoming versions:
    - Add testing for can_get and cannot_get using $remote_path as well
    - Check if we're uploading a file to where it really is right now, if so -
      prevent it
    - Add SKIP {} for connection-requiring methods
    - Check on functions that need the object is the object exists, fail
      automatically if it doesn't, with proper diag()

* Not any time soon, if at all:
    - Add tests for every possible connection success or fail (wrong host,
      missing attributes, timeout, etc.)
    - Allow different SFTP engines (Net::OpenSSH?)
    - Use an SSH server to be able to test the module in a more controlled
      manner
