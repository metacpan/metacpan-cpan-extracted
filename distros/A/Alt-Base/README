NAME
    Alt::Base - Base class for alternate module

VERSION
    version 0.02

SYNOPSIS
     # in your Alt/Foo/Bar/phrase.pm:
     package Alt::Foo::Bar::phrase;
     use base qw(Alt::Base);
     1;

     # customize options:
     package Alt::Foo::Bar::phrase;
     use base qw(Alt::Base);
     our %ALT = (check => 0, ...);
     1;

DESCRIPTION
    The Alt::Base class provides common functionalities for an alternate
    module. For more information about the Alt concept, please refer to Alt.

    Alt::Base defines an "import()" routine which checks for options in
    %ALT. These options are:

    *   check => BOOL (default: 1)

        If set to true (the default), will perform several things. First,
        check that the alternate module is indeed named
        "Alt::<<Original::Module>::<phrase>". Then, load "Alternate::Module"
        and check that the package variable $ALT is defined with the value
        of "phrase". This is to ensure that we are loading the correct
        module, and sometimes we do want to make sure about this. The wrong
        module can be loaded, for example if user reinstalls the original
        distribution or another alternate distribution.

        Will die upon failure.
