NAME

    HPC::Runner::Command - Create composable bioinformatics hpc analyses.

SYNOPSIS

    To create a new project

        hpcrunner.pl new MyNewProject

    To submit jobs to a cluster

        hpcrunner.pl submit_jobs

    To run jobs on an interactive queue or workstation

        hpcrunner.pl execute_job

DESCRIPTION

    HPC::Runner::Command is a set of libraries for scaffolding data
    analysis projects, submitting and executing jobs on an HPC cluster or
    workstation, and obsessively logging results.

    Get help by heading on over to github and raising an issue
    https://github.com/biosails/HPC-Runner-Command/issues.

    Please see the complete documentation at HPC::Runner::Command GitBooks
    .

Quick Start - Create a New Project

    You can create a new project, with a sane directory structure by using

            hpcrunner.pl new MyNewProject

Quick Start - Submit Workflows

 Simple Example

    Our simplest example is a single job type with no dependencies - each
    task is independent of all other tasks.

  Workflow file

            #preprocess.sh
    
            echo "preprocess" && sleep 10;
            echo "preprocess" && sleep 10;
            echo "preprocess" && sleep 10;

  Submit to the scheduler

            hpcrunner.pl submit_jobs --infile preprocess.sh

  Look at results!

            tree hpc-runner

 Job Type Dependencency Declaration

    Most of the time we have jobs that depend upon other jobs.

  Workflow file

            #blastx.sh
    
            #HPC jobname=unzip
            unzip Sample1.zip
            unzip Sample2.zip
            unzip Sample3.zip
    
            #HPC jobname=blastx
            #HPC deps=unzip
            blastx --db env_nr --sample Sample1.fasta
            blastx --db env_nr --sample Sample2.fasta
            blastx --db env_nr --sample Sample3.fasta

  Submit to the scheduler

            hpcrunner.pl submit_jobs --infile preprocess.sh

  Look at results!

            tree hpc-runner

 Task Dependencency Declaration

    Within a job type we can declare dependencies on particular tasks.

  Workflow file

            #blastx.sh
    
            #HPC jobname=unzip
            #TASK tags=Sample1
            unzip Sample1.zip
            #TASK tags=Sample2
            unzip Sample2.zip
            #TASK tags=Sample3
            unzip Sample3.zip
    
            #HPC jobname=blastx
            #HPC deps=unzip
            #TASK tags=Sample1
            blastx --db env_nr --sample Sample1.fasta
            #TASK tags=Sample2
            blastx --db env_nr --sample Sample2.fasta
            #TASK tags=Sample3
            blastx --db env_nr --sample Sample3.fasta

  Submit to the scheduler

            hpcrunner.pl submit_jobs --infile preprocess.sh

  Look at results!

            tree hpc-runner

 Declare Scheduler Variables

    Each scheduler has its own set of variables. HPC::Runner::Command has a
    set of generalized variables for declaring types across templates. For
    more information please see Job Scheduler Comparison
    <https://jerowe.gitbooks.io/hpc-runner-command-docs/content/job_submission/comparison.html>

    Additionally, for workflows with a large number of tasks, please see
    Considerations for Workflows with a Large Number of Tasks
    <https://jerowe.gitbooks.io/hpc-runner-command-docs/content/design_workflow.html#considerations-for-workflows-with-a-large-number-of-tasks>
    for information on how to group tasks together.

  Workflow file

            #blastx.sh
    
            #HPC jobname=unzip
            #HPC cpus_per_task=1
            #HPC partition=serial
            #HPC commands_per_node=1
            #TASK tags=Sample1
            unzip Sample1.zip
            #TASK tags=Sample2
            unzip Sample2.zip
            #TASK tags=Sample3
            unzip Sample3.zip
    
            #HPC jobname=blastx
            #HPC cpus_per_task=6
            #HPC deps=unzip
            #TASK tags=Sample1
            blastx --threads 6 --db env_nr --sample Sample1.fasta
            #TASK tags=Sample2
            blastx --threads 6 --db env_nr --sample Sample2.fasta
            #TASK tags=Sample3
            blastx --threads 6 --db env_nr --sample Sample3.fasta

  Submit to the scheduler

Previous Release

    This software was previously released under HPC::Runner.
    HPC::Runner::Command is a complete rewrite of the existing library.
    While it is meant to have much of the same functionality, it is not
    backwords compatible.

Acknowledgements

    As of Version 2.41:

    This modules continuing development is supported by NYU Abu Dhabi in
    the Center for Genomics and Systems Biology. With approval from NYUAD,
    this information was generalized and put on bitbucket, for which the
    authors would like to express their gratitude.

    Before Version 2.41

    This module was originally developed at and for Weill Cornell Medical
    College in Qatar within ITS Advanced Computing Team. With approval from
    WCMC-Q, this information was generalized and put on github, for which
