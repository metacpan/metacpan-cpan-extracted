Revision history for GPSD-Parse

0.01    2017-05-16
        - first version, released on an unsuspecting world.
        - all current functionality has tests and documentation
        - new features will be added immediately (see issues), this is simply
          the first release to ensure all POD renders correctly on the CPAN
        - we dynaload JSON::XS, and if it fails, fall back to JSON::PP to avoid
          having to require non-core JSON in the Makefile.PL
