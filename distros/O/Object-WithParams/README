Object-WithParams

Use this module to create objects that do nothing except contain parameters
defined by you which you can get and set as you wish.  Many modules such as
L<Data::FormValidator> have methods that accept an object with a param()
method and this object should be compatible with all of them.

INSTALLATION

If you have the Module::Signature module installed, you can verify the
integrity of this distribution by typing:

    cpansign -v

Module::Signature requires GnuPG which you can get from: 
http://www.gnupg.org/download/
A binary version for Windows is available from that page.
        
Then to install this module, run the following commands:

    perl Build.pl
    ./Build
    ./Build test
    ./Build install
    
On Windows you don't need to type the preliminary ./

Alternatively, you can do:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

If you are using ActiveState perl on Windows and you don't have a make 
utility, you can download nmake from:
http://download.microsoft.com/download/vc15/patch/1.52/w95/en-us/nmake15.exe
(Replace make with nmake in the instructions above if you are using it.)

If you are using Strawberry perl on Windows, it comes with a make utility 
called dmake.  (Replace make with dmake in the instructions above if you are
using it.)

NOTE: At the moment, some of the tests will fail on Windows if the path to the 
directory you unpacked the distribution in has spaces in it.  Either skip the 
tests or move to another directory.

DEPENDENCIES

This module is pure perl and should work with any version of perl, 5.006 or 
greater.

The signature can be tested by installing the following module:

Module::Signature

and setting the environment variable TEST_SIGNATURE to 1.

some tests check whether Object::WithParams is compatible with other modules 
from CPAN.  In order to run these tests, you will need to install the 
following modules:

Data::FormValidator    3.15
HTML::Template         2.1
Test::LongString

Further tests are contained in the xt subdirectory of the distribution.  Only
the author really needs to run them but if you want to do so as well, you 
will need to install the following modules:

Perl::Critic           1.098
Perl::MinimumVersion   1.20
Pod::Coverage          0.18
Pod::Simple            3.07
Test::CPAN::Meta       0.12
Test::DistManifest     1.003
Test::HasVersion       0.012
Test::Kwalitee
Test::MinimumVersion   0.008
Test::Perl::Critic     1.01
Test::Pod              1.26
Test::Pod::Coverage    1.08
