Revision history for perl module App::PrereqGrapher

0.14 2016-03-22 NEILB
    - One of the tests has always been failing on Windows, because it was
      failing to delete a test file that it created. Have made this not
      result in test failure, but also output more info, so I can try and
      work out why the unlink fails.

    - Better error message if you try to generate SVG format graph,
      but don't have Graph::Easy::As_svg installed. Also mentioned this
      in SEE ALSO. Thanks to Bartosz Jakubski.

    - timeout/depth could only be single-digit numbers
      (fix from ZOFFIX).

0.10 2014-02-02
    - Don't write to STDERR unless verbose option was given
    - Now used different filenames for each test, maybe that's
      causing the fails ...

0.09 2014-02-01
    - Changed the test filenames to fit in 8.3, in case that's
      why my Win32 tests are failing...

0.08 2014-02-01
    - After creating files in testsuite, chmod 0600 them before unlinking.
      Hopefully that will fix some test failures on Win32...
