	** Bump to version 1.14 for release.

2012-08-04  Daniel Hagerty  <hag@linnaean.org>

	* Traceroute.pm:
	** Integrate patches from Gerald HERMANT <ghermant@astrel.fr>:

	    options.
	*** argv: new public routine, capturing traceroute argument
	    calculation.

2011-02-19  Daniel Hagerty  <hag@linnaean.org>

	* Traceroute.pm:
	** Integrate cisco IOS support:
	*** Add a few status codes.
	*** Keep track of which chunk of traceroute input was most
	    recently seen for parsing purposes.
	*** Lots of regexp tweaks.
	*** Doc changes.

2011-02-16  Daniel Hagerty  <hag@linnaean.org>

	* Traceroute.pm:
	** Convert operations involving $& to s//.
	   $& is considered harmful.
	** Select the translation between !A-type icmp flags based on what
	   we're parsing, rather than assuming all is LBL ipv4.
	* t/33-parse-6flags.t
	** Unmark TODO tests; they pass now thanks to above.

2011-02-06  Daniel Hagerty  <hag@linnaean.org>

	* t/21-parse-4timeouts.t:
	** More test cases, especially targetting an issue seen on cisco
	   development branch.
	* t/33-parse-6flags.t
	** New test.

2011-02-05  Daniel Hagerty  <hag@linnaean.org>

	* t/95-sys-traceroute.t:
	** Specifically search for a traceroute executable on the system.
	   If we can't find one, skip the test in an obvious way.
	* Renamed:
	** t/50-parse-6basic.t -> t/30-parse-6basic.t
	** t/60-parse-6wierd.t -> t/34-parse-6wierd.t

2011-01-02  Daniel Hagerty  <hag@linnaean.org>

	* Traceroute.pm:
	** Bump version number for release.

2010-12-31  Daniel Hagerty  <hag@linnaean.org>

	* t/95-sys-traceroute.t:
	** New file: Recreate our original test.pl's most useful test.

2010-12-29  Daniel Hagerty  <hag@linnaean.org>

	* Traceroute.pm:
	** Prevent waitpid() on pipe close.
	* t/waitroute:
	** Unbuffer output.
	* t/80-tracelie.t, t/81-timeout.t:
	** Explicitly use "." in paths to test helper programs.
	* t/81-timeout.t:
	** Unmark TODO test; fixed by above.
	* Makefile.PL:
	** Re-enable installing on windows.

2010-12-13  Daniel Hagerty  <hag@linnaean.org>

	* Traceroute.pm:
	** Use a better (but still sleazy) IPv6 regexp.
	* t/60-parse-6wierd.t
	** Actually parse the traceroute.
	** Remove TODO markers.
	** Fix bug in data from hand editing.

2010-12-12  Daniel Hagerty  <hag@linnaean.org>

	* t/*.t:
	** New testing code.
	* t/testlib.pl:
	** Shared code for *.t files.
	* t/tracelie:
	** Provides a static traceroute for a fixture.
	* t/waitroute:
	** Provides a static traceroute and causes a timeout
	   for another fixture.
	* test.pl:
	** Removed; superseded by new test code.

2010-10-31  Daniel Hagerty  <hag@linnaean.org>

	* Traceroute.pm:
	** Rename some text_accumulator related names,
	   exposing it to the user.
	** Document how the text interface works.

2007-01-09  Daniel Hagerty  <hag@linnaean.org>

	* Traceroute.pm:
	** Version number bump.
	** Add fix for Redhat FC5's newest random patches from Keven Nolish.
	** Fix for timeout problems:
	*** Use sysread, not read.
	*** Remove call to eof immediately after pipe creation -- plays
	    badly with nonblocking & sysread.  Check performed elsehow.

2006-11-04  Daniel Hagerty  <hag@linnaean.org>

	* Traceroute.pm:
	** Start towards fixing timeout issues -- mark socket non-blocking
	   (duh); actually accumulate text rather than smashing the buffer.

2005-07-09  Daniel Hagerty  <hag@linnaean.org>

	* Traceroute.pm:
	** Fix regexp bug in how numeric icmp output codes were handled.
	** Document use_icmp.
	* TODO: update for current issues

2005-07-07  Daniel Hagerty  <hag@linnaean.org>

	* Traceroute.pm:
	** Add request use_icmp option (needs documentation).
	** Skip MPLS label stack information (for now).
	** Bump version for next release.

2004-05-24  Daniel Hagerty  <hag@linnaean.org>
	* Traceroute.pm:
	** Update parser to deal with traceroute on current linux.
	   Apparently some bozo thought some extra spacing here and there
	   would be cute.
	** Version bump to 1.08.
	* TODO:
	** New file.

2000-11-17  Daniel Hagerty  <hag@linnaean.org>

	* Traceroute.pm:
	** Added a default value to debug instance variable, to avoid
	perl warning
	** Incremented version number to 1.03.
	* test.pl:
	** Turned on perl warnings.

2000-08-15  Daniel Hagerty  <hag@linnaean.org>

	* Traceroute.pm:
	** Added error checking around our use of IO::Pipe.
	** Incremented version number for release

1999-11-28  Daniel Hagerty  <hag@linnaean.org>

	* First ChangeLog entry.
	* Traceroute.pm:
	** Bumped version to 1.01
	** Changed Net::Inet to Socket.  Only needed inet_aton and inet_ntoa.
	** host(): Wrapped inet_aton in an eval.
	* test.pl: Rewrote test 3 to be slightly more general, as too
	many operating systems have restrictions on what you can trace
	to.  Ask user if test is difficult.
