NAME
    Path::IsDev::HeuristicSet::FromConfig - A Custom Heuristic Set from a
    configuration file

VERSION
    version 0.002000

SYNOPSIS
        export PATH_ISDEV_DEFAULT_SET="FromConfig";
        # Whee, is_dev() and friends now seriously different everywhere

    By default, it will try to read a configuration file in one of the
    following paths:

        $HOME/.local/share/.path_isdev_heuristicset_fromconfig/config.json
        $HOME/.path_isdev_heuristicset_fromconfig/config.json

    Which ever one it is unfortunately dependent on the sort of mood
    File::HomeDir is in, and whether or not you have "xdg-user-dir" in your
    $PATH

    Either way, if such a path does not exist the first time you use this
    module, it will be created for you from the default template in the
    distributions share directory.

    Edit it to your liking.

    If you mess it up, just delete it, run the code again, and its back! :D

    In fact, its so aggressive at this, I had to put a bit of code in the
    tests to stop it creating those directories during tests >_>.

    Pester File::UserConfig if you want this logic improved.
