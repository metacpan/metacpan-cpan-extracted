README for Text::Positional::Ngram
===================================

Text::Positional::Ngram is a perl module to determine 
variable length non-contiguous and contiguous ngrams 
from large corpora.

The module:
   
   1. Provides an easy to use interface to determine ngrams from a 
      corpus. Some of the basic functionality include:

   *  returns variable length ngrams
   *  allow for a stop list 
   *  allows for a frequency cutoff
   *  allows for a remove cutoff

PROGRAM :  
===================================

text-positional-ngram-driver.pl

  This program takes as input a flat ASCII text file and outputs all
  Ngrams, or token sequences of length 'n', where the value of 'n' 
  can be decided by the user, and the frequency of the ngram.

  Using text-positional-ngram-driver.pl
  
  	The most basic way of running this program is the following: 

	    % text-positional-ngram-driver.pl output.txt input.txt 

	    where input.txt is the input text file in which to find 
	    the Ngrams and output.txt is the output file into which 
	    count.pl will put all the Ngrams with their frequencies. 

  Changing the Length of Ngrams 
	    
	The default ngram size is 2. This can be changed by using
	the parameter option --ngram N, where N is the number of
	tokens in each ngram. For example, to find all the trigrams
	in the file input.txt, you would running program:    
	 
	     %count.pl --ngram 3 output.txt input.txt

  Using User-Provided Token Definitions:
	 
	The default token definitions are:

	\w+	    -> this matches a contiguous sequence of 
		       alpha-numeric characters

	[\.,;:\?!]  -> this matches a single punctuation mark

	The default token definitions can be over-ridden by using 
	the option:
	
	     --token FILE 
	
	where FILE is the name of the file containing the regular 
	expressions on which the token definitions will be based. 

	Each regular expression in this FILE should be:
	      1. on a line of its own
	      2. should be delimited by the forward slash '/'. 
	      3. should be valid Perl regular expressions

  Removing character strings 

	This option 

	     --nontoken FILE
	
	allows a user to define regular expressions that 
	will match strings that should not be considered as tokens. 
	These strings will be removed from the data and not counted 
	or included in Ngrams. 

	The --nontoken option is recommended when there are predictable 
	sequences of characters that you know should not be included as 
	tokens for purposes of counting Ngrams, finding collocations, etc. 

	For example, if mark-up symbols like <s>, <p>, [item], [/ptr] 
	exist in text being processed, you may want to include those 
	in your list of nontoken items so they are discarded. If not, 
	a simple regex such as /\w+/ will match with 's', 'p', 'item',	
	'ptr' from these tags, leading to confusing results. 

	The FILE following the nontoken option file should contain Perl 
	regular expressions delimited by forward slashes '/' that define 
	non-tokens. Multiple expressions may be placed on separate lines 
	or be separated via the '|'  (Perl 'or') as in /regex1|regex2|../ 

	The following are some of the examples of valid non-token 
	definitions:

		/<\/?s|p>/ : will remove xml tags like <s>, <p>, </s>, </p>. 

		/\[\w+\]/  : will remove all words which appear in square 
			     brackets like [p], [item], [123] and so on. 

	The program will first remove any string from the input data that 
	matches the non-token regular expression, and only then will match 
	the remaining data against the token definitions. 

  The Output Format

        Assume that the following are the contents of the input text file to
	text-positional-ngram-driver.pl; let us call the file test.txt: 

		first line of text
		second line
		and a third line of text

	 Assume that text-positional-ngram-driver.pl is run in its most general
	 mode:

		 % text-positional-ngram-driver.pl test.out test.txt 

	 The output will contain all the bigrams found in the file test.txt
	 using the default tokens as specified above. The contents of the 
	 output file test.out would be:
	
		11
		line<>of<>2
		of<>text<>2
		second<>line<>1 
		line<>and<>1 
		and<>a<>1 
		a<>third<>1 
		first<>line<>1 
		third<>line<>1 
		text<>second<>1 

	 The number on the first line, 11, indicates that there were 
	 11 bigrams in test.txt

	 Following are the bigrams that were found in the test.txt file
	 delimited by the diamond sign, "<>". Therefore the first bigram
	 is line<>of<>, make up of the tokens "line" and "of" in that
	 order. After the diamond following the last token there is a 
	 number, this number denotes how many times this bigram occurred
	 in the text. 

  The Marginals Option

         To obtain the a partial set of marginal counts for the bigram
	 the option:

	     --marginals

	 must be set. This option outputs the individual frequency counts
	 of each token in the ngram. Let us use our example from above
	 but run the text-positional-ngram-driver.pl program as follows:

		 % text-positional-ngram-driver.pl --marginals test.out test.txt

	 The output will contain all the bigrams found i the file test.txt
	 using the default tokens as specified above, their frequency
	 counts and the number of times each of the tokens in the bigram
	 occurred in their respective positions. The contents of the 
	 output file test.out would be:
		11
		line<>of<>2 3 2 
		of<>text<>2 2 2 
		second<>line<>1 1 3 
		line<>and<>1 3 1 
		and<>a<>1 1 1 
		a<>third<>1 1 1 
		first<>line<>1 1 3 
		third<>line<>1 1 3 
		text<>second<>1 1 1 
 
	  The first number after the bigram is the frequency of the bigram
	  seen in test.out. The second number after the bigram is the
	  number of times the first token was seen in the first position 
	  of all the bigrams and the second number is the number of times
	  the second token was seen in the second position of all the
	  bigrams.


  Stoplists

	  The user may "stop" the Ngrams formed by text-positional-ngram-driver.pl 
	  by providing a list of stop-tokens through the option:

	      --stop FILE. 
	   
	  Each stop token in FILE should be a Perl regular expression that 
	  occurs on a line by itself. This expression should be delimited 
	  by forward slashes, as in /REGEX/. All regular expression 
	  capabilities in Perl are supported except for regular expression 
	  modifiers (like the "i" /REGEX/i). 

	  The following are a few examples of valid entries in the stop list.

		/^\d+$/
		/\bthe\b/
		/\b[Tt][Hh][Ee]\b/
		/^and$/
		/\bor\b/
		/^be(ing)?$/

		There are two modes in which a stop list can be used, 
		AND and OR. The default mode is AND, which means that
		an Ngram must be made up entirely of words from the
		stoplist before it is eliminated. The OR mode eliminates 
		an Ngram if any of the words that make up the Ngram
		are found in the stoplist.



  Removing Low Frequency Ngrams:

	   We allow the user to either remove or to not display low 
	   frequency Ngrams. The user can remove low frequency Ngrams
	   by using the option :

		--remove N
 
           by which all Ngrams that occur less than n times are
	   removed. The Ngram and the individual frequency counts are
	   adjusted accordingly upon the removal of these Ngrams. 
	   
	   The user can choose not to display low frequency Ngrams by
	   using the option :
	
		--frequency N, 
	
	   by which Ngrams that occur less than n times are not
	   displayed in the output. Note that this differs from the
	   remove option above in that the frequency counts are not
	   changed. 

  Windowing Option

	   The Ngrams shown above are all formed from contiguous
	   tokens. Although this is the default, we also allow Ngrams
	   to be formed from non-contiguous tokens.

	   We first need to define a "window" to be a sequence of k
	   contiguous tokens, where the value of k is greater than or
	   equal to the value of n for the Ngrams. The n tokens occur 
	   in the Ngram in exactly the same order as they occur in the 
	   window. 

	   For example if we take the phrase

		 why      s      the      stock      falling      ?

	   Then, the following are all the bigrams with a window size of 3:

		 why<>s<>               why<>the<>         s<>the<>    
		 s<>stock<>             the<>stock<>       the<>falling<>
		 stock<>falling<>       stock<>?<>         falling<>?<>

	   The following are all the bigrams with a window size of 4:

		 why<>s<>               why<>the<>         why<>stock<>
		 s<>the<>               s<>stock<>         s<>falling<>
		 the<>stock<>           the<>falling<>     the<>?<>
		 stock<>falling<>       stock<>?<>         falling<>?<>

	   The following are all the trigrams with a window size of 4:

		 why<>s<>the<>          why<>s<>stock<>     why<>the<>stock<>
		 s<>the<>stock<>        s<>the<>falling<>   s<>stock<>falling<>
		 the<>stock<>falling<>  the<>stock<>?<>     the<>falling<>?<>
		 stock<>falling<>?<>
