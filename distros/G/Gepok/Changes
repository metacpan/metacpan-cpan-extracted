0.27    2014-06-03 (SHARYANTO)

        - Do not pass Timeout param to HTTP::Daemon::SSL to avoid hanging
          problem when fed largish request (I'm experiencing request packet, GET
          or POST, above +- 2048 bytes hangs the server). This is a known issue:
          RT#45625 [queue HTTP::Daemon:SSL].


0.26    2014-04-16 (SHARYANTO)

        - Bugfix: fix setting _sock_peerhost (it used to display 127.0.0.1 all
          the time).


0.25    2014-03-21 (SHARYANTO)

        - Provide 'gepok.httpd_socket' in PSGI environment (mainly so we can
          call peercred() for Unix sockets).

        - Work better with plackup: accept string (comma-separator) http_ports,
          https_ports, unix_sockets so they can be specified as command-line
          options (--http_ports, and so on). Do not print access log to STDERR
          under plackup, since plackup by default prints one too.

        - Fix access log format: 31/Aug/2011, not 31/08/2011.
