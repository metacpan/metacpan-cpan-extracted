Revision history for Test-JSON-Schema-Acceptance

0.993     2020-05-08 16:55:43Z
        - soften type constraints so as to tolerate older Cpanel::JSON::XS,
          which inflates booleans to different types
        - print information about this module's version, and the commit and
          version of the test suite data we are using
        - new "verbose" option, for more helpful output when running under
          "make test" or "prove"
        - improved handling of exceptions from the tested implementation
        - updated test suite to commit 9d0e0eb31d6be6bebd3bacdd6be119a8841e9999

0.992     2020-05-04 22:40:44Z
        - fix minimum declared version for List::Util (RT#132461)
        - increase minimum version for JSON::MaybeXS, to ensure that booleans
          are JSON::PP::Boolean, not JSON::XS::Boolean
        - include tabular results of passes, fails for each test file (GH #3)
        - updated test suite to commit 361620ecf18b71883f8522cb4c7e95e3e0adcdce

0.991     2020-04-30 23:56:50Z
        - switch from JSON.pm to JSON::MaybeXS (GH #1)
        - package the submodule of test cases in a sharedir (GH #2)
        - additional constructor options, including use of a custom directory
        - add options "validate_data" and "validate_json_string", to
          accomodate the JSON Schema backend preferring either inflated data or a
          JSON-encoded string. (GH #4)
        - remove undocumented "only_test" option, and ability to skip test by
          number (GH #10, GH #11)
        - clearer labels for each test
        - new "tests" option, for restricting the tests that are run (GH #7)
        - deprecated "skip_tests" option
        - new "todo_tests" option, for acknowledging that certain tests do not
          pass yet (GH #6)
        - non-ascii characters are not corrupted during decoding (GH #13)
        - always read test data files in sorted order, for consistent results
        - updated test suite to commit ab9e3d5c53abe0a0d2a5a21429fb12524b0926a0
