Authen::SASL::XS - XS code to glue Perl SASL to Cyrus SASL

1. Build Authen::SASL::XS

First of all you need Authen::SASL installed at least in version 2.06 (with
server patch or higher).

Then run the Makefile.PL:

If you want to link it with SASL v1 library:

# perl Makefile.PL LIBS="-lsasl"

if your SASL library is located in another path:

# perl Makefile.PL INC=-I/opt/products/sasl/1.5.28/include \
? LIBS="-L/opt/products/sasl/1.5.28/lib -lsasl"

If you want to link it with SASL v2 library:

# perl Makefile.PL LIBS="-lsasl2" DEFINE="-DSASL2"

if your SASL library is located in another path:

# perl Makefile.PL INC=-I/opt/products/sasl/2.1.15/include \
? LIBS="-L/opt/products/sasl/2.1.15/lib -lsasl2" DEFINE="-DSASL2"

(Make sure that you set --with-plugin-dir correct when compiling
Cyrus SASL or that you point the enviroment variable SASL_PATH to
the correct plugin directory before starting make test or your
application)

After successful Makefile creation run

# make
# make test
# make install

(for a successful make test you have to have installed the PLAIN mechanism)

And everything is installed.

If you want to test gssapi functionality, copy the gssapiskel.pl to gssapi.t
and edit the file correctly. Don't forget the create keytabfiles. Then
rerun make test and see what happens.

2. Use Authen::SASL::XS with GSSAPI for LDAP

If you are able to use the ldap* tools with GSSAPI and now you want to use Perl
for this LDAP work, then you need Authen::SASL::XS 1.00 or later. Please try
this script before reporting any bugs or problems:

#!/usr/bin/perl -w
use Net::LDAP;
use Authen::SASL;

my $slavesasl = Authen::SASL->new(mechanism=>'GSSAPI'
    'user' => " ",  # empty callback, so Net::LDAP don't overrides it
);

my $ldap = Net::LDAP->new('server', version=>3, async=>1) || die "$@";

my $mesg = $ldap->bind("", sasl=>$slavesasl, async=>1);

$mesg->code && die $mesg->error;

$mesg = $ldap->search(async=>1,filter=>"(objectClass=*)",base=>"dc=workgroup");

@entries = $mesg->entries;

foreach $entry (@entries) {
	     $entry->dump;
}

##
If you discover any problem please report the error message, your SASL version and
your LDAP version to me.
