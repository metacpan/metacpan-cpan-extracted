SYNOPSIS
      # send a message to the queue 'foo'
      use Net::Stomp;
      my $stomp = Net::Stomp->new( { hostname => 'localhost', port => '61613' } );
      $stomp->connect( { login => 'hello', passcode => 'there' } );
      $stomp->send(
          { destination => '/queue/foo', body => 'test message' } );
      $stomp->disconnect;

      # subscribe to messages from the queue 'foo'
      use Net::Stomp;
      my $stomp = Net::Stomp->new( { hostname => 'localhost', port => '61613' } );
      $stomp->connect( { login => 'hello', passcode => 'there' } );
      $stomp->subscribe(
          {   destination             => '/queue/foo',
              'ack'                   => 'client',
              'activemq.prefetchSize' => 1

        warn $frame->body; # do something here
        $stomp->ack( { frame => $frame } );
      }
      $stomp->disconnect;

      # write your own frame
       my $frame = Net::Stomp::Frame->new(
           { command => $command, headers => $conf, body => $body } );
      $self->send_frame($frame);

DESCRIPTION
    This module allows you to write a Stomp client. Stomp is the Streaming
    Text Orientated Messaging Protocol (or the Protocol Briefly Known as
    TTMP and Represented by the symbol :ttmp). It's a simple and easy to
    implement protocol for working with Message Orientated Middleware from
    any language. Net::Stomp is useful for talking to Apache ActiveMQ, an
    open source (Apache 2.0 licensed) Java Message Service 1.1 (JMS) message
    broker packed with many enterprise features.

    A Stomp frame consists of a command, a series of headers and a body -
    see Net::Stomp::Frame for more details.

    For details on the protocol see <http://stomp.codehaus.org/Protocol>.

    To enable the ActiveMQ Broker for Stomp add the following to the
    activemq.xml configuration inside the <transportConnectors> section:

      <transportConnector name="stomp" uri="stomp://localhost:61613"/>

    To enable the ActiveMQ Broker for Stomp and SSL add the following inside
    the <transportConnectors> section:

      <transportConnector name="stomp+ssl" uri="stomp+ssl://localhost:61612"/>

    For details on Stomp in ActiveMQ See
    <http://activemq.apache.org/stomp.html>.

METHODS
  new
    The constructor creates a new object. You must pass in a hostname and a
    port:

      my $stomp = Net::Stomp->new( { hostname => 'localhost', port => '61613' } );

    If you want to use SSL, make sure you have IO::Socket::SSL and pass in
    the SSL flag:

      my $stomp = Net::Stomp->new( {
        hostname => 'localhost',
        port     => '61612',
        ssl      => 1,
      } );

    If you want to pass in IO::Socket::SSL options:

      my $stomp = Net::Stomp->new( {
        hostname    => 'localhost',
        port        => '61612',
        ssl         => 1,
        ssl_options => { SSL_cipher_list => 'ALL:!EXPORT' },
      } );

  connect
    This connects to the Stomp server. You must pass in a login and
    passcode.

    You may pass in 'client-id', which specifies the JMS Client ID which is
    used in combination to the activemqq.subscriptionName to denote a
    durable subscriber.

      $stomp->connect( { login => 'hello', passcode => 'there' } );

  send
    This sends a message to a queue or topic. You must pass in a destination
    and a body.

      $stomp->send(
          { destination => '/queue/foo', body => 'test message' } );

    To send a BytesMessage, you should set the field 'bytes_message' to 1.

  send_transactional
    This sends a message in transactional mode and fails if the receipt of
    the message is not acknowledged by the server:

      $stomp->send_transactional(
          { destination => '/queue/foo', body => 'test message' }
      ) or die "Couldn't send the message!";

    If using ActiveMQ, you might also want to make the message persistent:

      $stomp->send_transactional(
          { destination => '/queue/foo', body => 'test message', persistent => 'true' }
      ) or die "Couldn't send the message!";

  disconnect
    This disconnects from the Stomp server:

      $stomp->disconnect;

  subscribe
    This subscribes you to a queue or topic. You must pass in a destination.

    The acknowledge mode defaults to 'auto', which means that frames will be
    considered delivered after they have been sent to a client. The other
    option is 'client', which means that messages will only be considered
    delivered after the client specifically acknowledges them with an ACK
    frame.

    Other options:

    'selector': which specifies a JMS Selector using SQL 92 syntax as
    specified in the JMS 1.1 specificiation. This allows a filter to be
    applied to each message as part of the subscription.

    'activemq.dispatchAsync': should messages be dispatched synchronously or
    asynchronously from the producer thread for non-durable topics in the
    broker. For fast consumers set this to false. For slow consumers set it
    to true so that dispatching will not block fast consumers.

    'activemq.exclusive': Would I like to be an Exclusive Consumer on a
    queue.

    'activemq.maximumPendingMessageLimit': For Slow Consumer Handlingon
    non-durable topics by dropping old messages - we can set a maximum
    pending limit which once a slow consumer backs up to this high water
    mark we begin to discard old messages.

    'activemq.noLocal': Specifies whether or not locally sent messages
    should be ignored for subscriptions. Set to true to filter out locally
    sent messages.

    'activemq.prefetchSize': Specifies the maximum number of pending
    messages that will be dispatched to the client. Once this maximum is
    reached no more messages are dispatched until the client acknowledges a
    message. Set to 1 for very fair distribution of messages across
    consumers where processing messages can be slow.

    'activemq.priority': Sets the priority of the consumer so that
    dispatching can be weighted in priority order.

    'activemq.retroactive': For non-durable topics do you wish this
    subscription to the retroactive.

    'activemq.subscriptionName': For durable topic subscriptions you must
    specify the same clientId on the connection and subscriberName on the
    subscribe.

      $stomp->subscribe(
          {   destination             => '/queue/foo',
              'ack'                   => 'client',
              'activemq.prefetchSize' => 1
          }
      );

  unsubscribe
    This unsubscribes you to a queue or topic. You must pass in a
    destination:

      $stomp->unsubcribe({ destination => '/queue/foo' });

  receive_frame
    This blocks and returns you the next Stomp frame.

      my $frame = $stomp->receive_frame;
      warn $frame->body; # do something here

    The header bytes_message is 1 if the message was a BytesMessage.

  can_read
    This returns whether a frame is waiting to be read. Optionally takes a
    timeout in seconds:

      my $can_read = $stomp->can_read;
      my $can_read = $stomp->can_read({ timeout => '0.1' });

  ack
    This acknowledges that you have received and processed a frame (if you
    are using client acknowledgements):

      $stomp->ack( { frame => $frame } );

  nack
    This informs the remote end that you have been unable to process a
    received frame (if you are using client acknowledgements)
    (See individual stomp server documentation for information about
    additional fields that can be passed to alter NACK behavior):

      $stomp->nack( { frame => $frame } );

  send_frame
    If this module does not provide enough help for sending frames, you may
    construct your own frame and send it:

      # write your own frame
      my $frame = Net::Stomp::Frame->new(
           { command => $command, headers => $conf, body => $body } );
      $self->send_frame($frame);
