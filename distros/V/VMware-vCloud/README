NAME

    VMware::vCloud - VMware vCloud Director

VERSION

    version 2.404

SYNOPSIS

      my $vcd = new VMware::vCloud ( $hostname, $username, $password, $orgname, { debug => 1 } );
      my %vapps = $vcd->list_vapps();
    
      my $vappid = $vapps{'My Personal vApp'};
    
      my $vapp = $vcd->get_vapp($vappid);
      my $ret = $vapp->power_on();

DESCRIPTION

    This module provides a Perl interface to VMware's vCloud Director.

    It's intention is to provide a high-level perl-style interface to
    vCloud Director actions.

    If you are looking for a direct and low-level access to the vCloud API,
    you may want to look at VMware::API::vCloud, which is packaged and used
    by this module.

EXAMPLE SCRIPTS

    Included in the distribution of this module are several example
    scripts. Hopefully they provide an illustrative example of the use of
    vCloud Director. All scripts have their own POD and accept command line
    parameters in a similar way to the VIPERL SDK utilities and vghetto
    scripts.

            login.pl - An example script that demonstrates logging in to the server.
            org_get.pl - Selects a random organization and prints a Data::Dumper dump of it's information.
            list-vapps.pl - Prints a list of all VMs the user has access to.

MODULE METHODS

 new($host,$user,$pass,$org,$conf)

    This method instances the VMware::vCloud object and verifies the user
    can log onto the server.

    $host, $user, and $pass are required. They should contain the login
    information for the vCloud server.

    $org and $conf are optional.

    $org is the vCloud Organization to connect to. If $org is not given,
    the default of 'System' is used.

    $conf is an optional hasref containing tuneable parameters:

      * debug - set to a true value to turn on STDERR debugging statements.

 debug(1|0)

    This turns debugging on and off programatically. An argument of '1' for
    debugging, '0' for no debugging.

 login()

    This method is deprecated and will be removed in later releases.

    This method roughly emulates the default login action of the API: It
    returns information on which organizations are accessible to the user.

    It is a synonym for list_orgs() and all details on return values should
    be take from that method's documentation.

 purge()

    This method clears the in-module caching of API responses.

    This module caches many API calls to reduce response times and load on
    the server. This cache is automatically cleared when a method that
    changes the status of the VCD server is called. However, there may be
    times when you have a lon running process, or wish to manually clear
    the cache yourself.

VAPP METHODS

 create_vapp_from_template($name,$vdcid,$tmplid,$netid)

    Given a name, VDC, template and network, instantiate the template with
    the given settings and other defaults.

 create_vapp_from_sources(...)

    Create a vApp from varied sources

    Details of the create task will be returned.

 delete_vapp($vapp_href)

    Given the org HREF, call a delete on it.

 get_vapp($vappid)

    Given an vApp id, it returns a vApp object for that vApp.

    See the documentation on VMware::vCloud::vApp for full details on this
    object type.

      catalogs = references to the catalogs within the org
      vdcs - references to the org VDCs within the org
    
      raw - The raw returned XML structure for the organization from the API

 list_orgs()

    This method returns a hash or hashref of Organization names and IDs.

ORG VDC METHODS

 create_vdc($org_url,$conf)

 delete_vdc($vdc_href);

    Given the org VDC HREF, call a delete on it.

 disable_vdc($vdc_href)

    Given a VDC href, call the disable action on it.

 enable_vdc($vdc_href)

    Given a VDC href, call the enable action on it.

 get_vdc($vdc_href)

    Given an VDC href, it returns a hash of data for that vDC.

 list_vdcs() | list_vdcs($orgid)

    This method returns a hash or hashref of VDC names and IDs the user has

    Specifically, this method will block and continue to query the task
    while it has any of the following statuses:

      * queued - The task has been queued for execution.

      * preRunning - The task is awaiting preprocessing or administrative
      action.

    The return value will be and array or arrayref composed of two
    elements:

      * The status code returned by the server

      * A hashref comprising the most recently retrived for of the task
      object. IE: the same output as get_task()

ADMINISTRATIVE METHODS

    Returns a reference to the first associated vcenter server.

  webclienturl($type,$moref)

    Give the vimserver type and managed object reference, this method
    returns the URL for viewing the object via the vSphere Web client. This
    is handy for finding further details on objects within vSphere.

NOTES

 ID VERSUS HREF

    Tl;DR - Use HREFs and not IDs.

    Internally, objects are identified in the vCloud Director API via
    either an UUID or a HREF that references that object.

    According to the API documentation, (as of 5.1) UUIDs are not
    guaranteed to always be consistent between connections, but HREFs are
    considered permanent.

    Consequently, it is considered a best practice to use HREFs as the
    unique identifier of an object. This module implements this best
    practice.
