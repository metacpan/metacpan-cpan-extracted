HTML::Defaultify 1.0.1  (released June 17, 2002)

========================================================================

This Perl module is used to populate HTML forms with default values.  Unlike
other tools that fill a similar niche, this module can handle any existing
HTML page; this approach allows a clean separation of HTML development from
Perl program development.

For more complete documentation, run "perldoc HTML::Defaultify", or to run
perldoc on the Defaultify.pm file before installing it, run
"perldoc -F Defaultify.pm".  If your perldoc fails and says it "cannot find
blib", then run perldoc from a directory with no Makefile.PL-- it's an
apparent bug in some perldoc's.

REQUIRES

HTML::Defaultify prefers to use HTML::Entities.  If HTML::Entities is not
available, HTML::Defaultify works without it but slightly less reliably when
character entity references are used.  Install HTML::Entities if you can.


INSTALLATION

Like most Perl modules, HTML::Defaultify is installed by unpacking the
distribution and running these commands:

  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test       (optional)
  make install    (normally must be done as root)

That should be sufficient.  For documentation on usage, run
"perldoc HTML::Defaultify".
