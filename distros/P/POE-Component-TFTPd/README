     );

METHODS
  create(%args)
    Component constructor.

    Args:

     Name        => default   # Comment
     --------------------------------------------------------------------
     alias       => TFTPd     # Alias for the POE session
     address     => 127.0.0.1 # Address to listen to
     port        => 69        # Port to listen to
     timeout     => 10        # Seconds between block sent and ACK
     retries     => 3         # How many retries before giving up on host
     max_clients => undef     # Maximum concurrent connections

  clients
    Returns a hash-ref, containing all the clients:

     $client_id => $client_obj

    See "POE::Component::TFTPd::Client" for details

  max_clients
    Pointer to max number of concurrent clients:

     print $self->max_clients;
     $self->max_clients = 4;

  retries
    Pointer to the number of retries:

     print $self->retries;
     $self->retries = 4;

  timeout
    Pointer to the timeout in seconds:

     print $self->timeout;
     $self->timeout = 4;

  address
    Returns the address the server listens to.

  alias
    The alias for the POE session.

  kernel
    Method alias for $_[KERNEL].

  port
    Returns the local port

  sender
    Returns the sender session.

  server
    Returns the server: "POE::Wheel::UDP".

  session
    Returns this session.

  cleanup
     1. Logs that the server is done with the client
     2. deletes the client from C<$self-E<gt>clients>
     3. Calls C<tftpd_done> event in sender session

  log
    Calls SENDER with event name 'tftpd_log' and these arguments:

      $_[ARG0] = $level
      $_[ARG1] = $client
      $_[ARG2] = $msg

    $level is the same as "Log::Log4perl" use.

STATES
  start
    Starts the server, by setting up "POE::Wheel::UDP".

  stop
    Stops the TFTPd server, by deleting the UDP wheel.

  check_connections
    Checks for connections that have timed out, and destroys them. This is
    done periodically, every second.

  input
    Takes some input, figure out the opcode and pass the request on to the
    next stage.

     opcode | event    | method
     -------|----------|-------------
     rrq    | init_rrq | init_request
     wrq    | init_wrq | init_request
     ack    | get_ack  | get_data
     data   | get_data | get_data

  send_data => $client, $data
    Sends data to the client. Used for both ACK and DATA. It resends data
    automatically on failure, and decreases "$client->retries".

  get_data => $client, $data
    Handles both ACK and DATA packets.

    If correct packet-number:

     1. Logs the packet number
     2. Calls C<tftpd_receive> / C<tftpd_send> in sender session

    On failure:

     1. Logs failure
     2. Resends the last packet

  init_request => $args, $opcode, $data
     1. Checks if max_clients limit is reached. If not, sets up

      $client->filename  = $file;    # the filename to read/write
      $client->mode      = uc $mode; # only OCTET is valid
      $client->rfc       = [ ... ];
      $client->timestamp = time;

     2. Calls C<tftpd_init> in sender session.

     3. Calls C<tftpd_send> in sender session, if read-request from client

  send_error => $client, $error_key [, $args]
    Sends an error to the client.

     $error_key referes to C<%TFTP_ERROR>
     $args is an array ref that can be used to replace %x in the error string
