NAME
    Object::NulStr - Object which stringifies to NUL character ("\0")

VERSION
    version 0.02

SYNOPSIS
     use Object::NulStr;

     die Object::NulStr->new; # dies without seemingly printing anything

DESCRIPTION
    Object::NulStr is like Object::BlankStr, but instead of stringifying to
    "" (empty string), it stringifies to "\0" (NUL character). This has the
    benefit of having a boolean true value so checking exception is simpler
    (a simple if on $@ will do). But Object::BlankStr might suit you better
    if printing "\0" has some undesired side effects. Too bad we can't have
    it both ways for now.

    So far the only case I've found this to be useful is for die()-ing
    without printing anything. If you just use 'die;' or 'die "";' Perl will
    print the default "Died at ..." message. But if you say 'die
    Object::NulStr->new;' Perl will die without seemingly printing anything.
