pyperl - Perl for Python
------------------------

This is a Python extension module that makes it possible to embed Perl
interpreter(s) in any Python program.  It can be used to invoke
arbitrary Perl code, load any Perl modules and make calls directly
into Perl functions.  The Perl code invoked can call back into Python
as it see fit.

You can select between 2 flavours for how to build the Perl for Python
extension.  Which flavour to build is selected by the presence (or
absence) of the MULTI_PERL file in this directory.  When MULTI_PERL is
enabled, each python thread will get its own separate perl
interpreter.  For -DMULTI_PERL builds an ithread eanabled perl is
required.  It means that if you build your own perl you should pass
the -Dusethreads option to 'Configure'.

Perl 5.6.0 or better is required.  Python 1.5.2 or better is required.

Before you can build the Python extension module you should build the
Python::Object module for Perl.  This allow Perl to access Python
objects passed in from python calls.  This must be built first, since
perlmodule.c reference it and want to link with it.

There are also some patches to perl and python itself within the
patches/ directory that you might want to apply before you build.
The patches/README file tell you what you get.

Build instructions:

  - make sure your PATH is set up so that 'perl' and 'python'
    reference the versions of the language interpreters that you
    want to use.

  - If you are using Python-1.5.2, then you need to install
    the Distutils package version 0.9 or better first.

  - Run these commands:

      (cd Python-Object; perl Makefile.PL; make install)
      python setup.py install

  - You should now be able to run the test.py test script.

      python test.py


The Perl for Python extension is known to work on Linux i386, Sparc
Solaris and MS-Windows.

The API for using perl from python is documented in the perlmodule.pod
file.  The file can be converted to other formats with the pod2* tools
that come with perl.
