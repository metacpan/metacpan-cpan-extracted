Description: Concatenate list model objects in Gtk2-Perl
 Gtk2::Ex::ListModelConcat presents the contents of multiple list type
 Gtk2::TreeModel objects as a single concatenated model.  Changes in
 the sub-models are reported up, and changes can be applied down
 through the Concat model if the sub-models are editable.
