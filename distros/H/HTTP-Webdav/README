This is the Perl interface to the neon HTTP and WebDAV client library.

neon has the following features:

  - High-level interface to HTTP and WebDAV methods (PUT, GET, HEAD etc) 

  - Low-level interface to HTTP request handling, to allow implementing new methods easily. 

  - HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/1.0 persistent connections 

  - RFC2617 basic and digest authentication (including auth-int, md5-sess) 

  - Proxy support (including basic/digest authentication) 

  - Generic WebDAV 207 XML response handling mechanism 

  - XML parsing using the expat or libxml parsers 

  - Easy generation of error messages from 207 error responses 

  - WebDAV resource manipulation: MOVE, COPY, DELETE, MKCOL. 

  - WebDAV metadata support: set and remove properties, query any set of properties (PROPPATCH/PROPFIND). 


WARNING: This wrapper is alpha code, while neon is around for some time and
stable to use, not all of the interface functions provided by this Perl module
has been tested extensivly, but most of them should work without problems (At least
they do it for me :-).
