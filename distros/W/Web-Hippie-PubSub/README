SYNOPSIS
      use Plack::Builder;
      use AnyMQ;
      use AnyMQ::ZeroMQ;

      my $bus = AnyMQ->new_with_traits(
        traits            => [ 'ZeroMQ' ],
        subscribe_address => 'tcp://localhost:4001',
        publish_address   => 'tcp://localhost:4000',
      );

      # your plack application
      my $app = sub { ... }

      builder {
        # mount hippie server on /_hippie/*
        mount '/_hippie' => builder {
          enable "+Web::Hippie::PubSub",
            keep_alive => 30,   # send 'ping' event every 30 seconds
            bus        => $bus;
          sub {
            my $env = shift;
            my $args = $env->{'hippie.args'};
            my $handle = $env->{'hippie.handle'};
            # Your handler based on PATH_INFO: /init, /error, /message
          }
        };
        mount '/' => my $app;
      };
