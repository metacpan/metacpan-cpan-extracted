Template::TT2Site is a framework to create web sites using the
Template Toolkit.

The technical structure of the site is patterned after the method
described in chapter 11 of I<The Badger Book>. The structure has been
slightly simplified for ease of use, and a couple of neat features are
added:

* The resultant site is position independent, i.e., it only uses
  relative URLs to the extent possible. This makes it easy to build
  partial sites, and to relocate the contents.

* The necessary means are provided to create multi-language sites, where
  each page gets a link to its translations.

* The 'site.map' hash, required for site navigation, is created
  automatically using minimal, position independent, directions.

All functions are executed using a driver program, making the package
easy to use and platform independent. Installation takes place using
the platform independent Module::Build tool.
