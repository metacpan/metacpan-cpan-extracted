Revision history for Perl extension Env::C.

0.14  2017-03-31
- minor POD updates [Thanks José Joaquín Atria]
- Add tests for override flag [Thanks José Joaquín Atria]
- Use is() instead of ok() in tests [Thanks José Joaquín Atria]
- apply skiplist to signature test

0.13  2015-05-02
- flip order of ppport.h and XSUB.h includes to fix duplicate declaration
  warnings [Thanks Ian Bottomley]
- Fix test failures in docker containers because smoke.t assumes $ENV{USER}
  exists, but in docker this is not (necessarily) true.

0.12  2014-11-03
- Narrow down "panic: free from wrong pool" error to perl with both threads,
  and PERL_TRACK_MEMPOOL (enabled implicitly with DEBUGGING).  work around
  by using PL_use_safe_putenv only if building under threaded perl with
  PERL_TRACK_MEMPOOL.  [#99962]

0.11  2014-10-31
- FreeBSD: fix SIGV at exit for perl < 5.19.6 by using PL_use_safe_putenv.
  This causes setenv to leak memory, but seems to be the only way to avoid
  SIGV. [#49872]
- MANIFEST.SKIP: add MYMETA.json, MYMETA.yml
- update to latest ppport.h
- prereqs: require Test::More v0.88 or later, exclude optional
  Module::Signature

0.10  2013-04-09
- fix memory leak due to PL_use_safe_putenv = 1 [#49872]

0.09  2012-06-25

- new maintainer: Michael Schout <mschout@cpan.org>
- use Dist::Zilla for distribution management
- fix: getallenv() segmentation fault under OS X 10.7

0.08 Thu Sep  4 08:50:40 PDT 2008

- fix the first test, where getenv returns undef on windows, rather
than ''.

- undo part of the patch for windows in wez@messagesystems.com's patch

- another patch from wez@messagesystems.com, to solve the "panic: free
from wrong pool during global destruction" problem he detected on his
x64 linux build. using PL_use_safe_putenv.

- Env-C assumes that there are no native functions for manipulating the
environment on Solaris 10, and this results in a segmentation fault when
running the test script.

The attached patch detects solaris versions that have these functions in
libc by doing the same thing that the stdlib.h header does to reveal the
prototype.  Ideally the Makefile.PL would detect the functions using a
compiler check, but this seems like the simplest approach for the moment.
