NAME
    MP3::ID3Lib - ID3v1/ID3v2 Tagging of MP3 files

SYNOPSIS
      use MP3::ID3Lib;
      my $id3 = MP3::ID3Lib->new($filename);

      foreach my $frame (@{$id3->frames}) {
        my $code = $frame->code;
        my $description = $frame->description;
        my $value = $frame->value;
        $frame->set("Orange") if $code eq 'TPE1';
        print "$description: $value\n";
      }

      $id3->add_frame("TIT2", "Title goes here");
      $id3->commit;

DESCRIPTION
    This module allows you to edit and add ID3 tags in MP3 files.

    ID3 tags are small pieces of information stored inside the MP3 file.
    They can contain bits of metadata about the MP3, such as album name,
    song name, artist, original artist, genre, composer, year of release,
    additional comment fields, and many more.

    This module is an interface to the high-quality id3lib library available
    from http://id3lib.sourceforge.net/, which must be installed. At the
    moment, it is a bit of a low-level interface and some knowledge of ID3v2
    is useful. You should know about tag names and tag usage. The best
    website for this is http://www.id3.org/.

    However, to get started, a few frame names you may find useful are:

    * TIT2: Title/songname/content description
    * TPE1: Lead performer(s)/Soloist(s) (artist)
    * TALB: Album/Movie/Show title
    * TRCK: Track number/Position in set
    * TYER: Year
    * TCON: Content type ('genre')
    * COMM: Comments

    Please note that id3v1 has length restrictions on these fields.

BUGS
    The API could be better and there are a couple of small memory leaks.

    This module currently only returns the first 100 ASCII characters of a
    text tag.

    This module is currently unable to read or write ID3 v2.4.0 tags.

THANKS
    Thanks go to Chris Nandor for letting me use his test MP3s and to Paul
    Mison for the idea.
