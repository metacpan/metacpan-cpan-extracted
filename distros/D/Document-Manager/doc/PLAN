Future
======
   * Create some tests
   * Ideally, documents() should never encounter an error condition...
   * Should Document::Repository::add() really be put()?
   * Add error_msg handling for new routines
   * Document inputs/outputs for all new routines
   * Should Document::Repository really die in its new() routine?
   * Add logging / changelog
   * Persist the next_id so it can be loaded...
   * Access Control Lists?
   * delete/undelete
   * Attachment of notes (or should this be done as metadata?)
   * diff's
   * content search - namazu?
   * What to do about localization, translations, etc.?
   * Document format conversion (to pdf, png, html, etc.)
   * Triggers / Events - whenever a change occurs, listeners are notified
   * Automatic distribution - either on triggers or scheduled
   * Status watching (notify when quantity of files reaches threshholds, etc.)
   * Conversion of mail to DMS
   * Repackaging (tar.gz / zip)
   * Create docs like at
     http://pwp.netcabo.pt/users/1/0154115101/software/newdocms/technical-info.html
   * Consider caching of query results
