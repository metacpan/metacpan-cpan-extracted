<H1>A. Credits</H1>
<P>SDF has taken several years to put together and would not exist in its current form without the contributions below.</P>
<P>Firstly, thanks to my former <EM>Leeds and Northrup Australia</EM> colleagues, particularly Tom Beale, Craig Gibbings and Greg Birnie, for inspiring my initial interest in <EM>literate programming</EM>.</P>
<P>Secondly, thanks to Tim Hudson (<A HREF="mailto:tjh@cryptsoft.com">tjh@cryptsoft.com</A>) for being SDF's biggest fan. Tim has assisted in design, fixed bugs, added features, &quot;sold&quot; SDF to many of its current user base and generally hassled me to package SDF into its current form. Thanks also to Chris Moran (<A HREF="mailto:chris.moran@mincom.com">chris.moran@mincom.com</A>) for maintaining the <A HREF="http://www.mincom.com/mtr/sdf">SDF Home Page</A>, assisting in design, etc. Many other <A HREF="http://www.mincom.com">Mincom</A> colleagues have assisted with SDF, particularly Craig Willis and David Cox. Thanks to everyone involved.</P>
<P>SDF is built on <A HREF="http://www.perl.com/perl/index.html">Perl</A>, a freely available scripting language created by Larry Wall (<A HREF="mailto:larry@wall.org">larry@wall.org</A>). Without Perl, SDF would not exist. Thanks Larry.</P>
<P>Finally, thanks to my wife, Geraldine, for being my best friend and inspiring me to develop SDF.</P>
