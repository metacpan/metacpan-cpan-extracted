NAME
    Pry - intrude on your code

SYNOPSIS
       use Pry;
   
       ...;
       pry;
       ...;

DESCRIPTION
    Kind of a bit like a debugger, kind of a bit like a REPL.

    This module gives you a function called `pry` that you can drop into your
    code anywhere. When Perl executes that line of code, it will stop and drop
    you into a REPL. You can use the REPL to inspect any lexical variables
    (and even alter them), call functions and methods, and so on.

    All the clever stuff is in the REPL. Rather than writing yet another Perl
    REPL, Pry uses Reply, which is an awesome yet fairly small REPL with
    support for plugins that can do some really useful stuff, such as
    auto-complete of function and variable names.

    Once you've finished using the REPL, just hit Ctrl+D and your code will
    resume execution.

  Functions
    `pry()`
        Starts the Pry REPL.

    `pry(@varnames)`
        Dumps selected variables before starting the Pry REPL.

        Note a list of variable *names* is expected; not *values*. For
        example:

           my $x = 42;
           my @y = (666, 999);
           pry('$x', '@y');

   Utility Functions
    The following functions are provided for your convenience. They cannot be
    exported, so you should access them, from the REPL, using their
    fully-qualified name.

    `Pry::Lexicals`
        Returns a hashref of your lexical variables.

    `Pry::Trace`
        Returns the stack trace as a Devel::StackTrace object.

    `Pry::Dump(@variable_names)`
        Dumps variables (which must exist somewhere in the `Pry::Lexicals`
        hashref).

  Package Variable
    $Pry::Dumper
        Decides the backend dumper implementation used by `Pry::Dump()`. Valid
        values are "Data::Dump" and "Data::Dumper".

CONFIGURATION
    Pry's REPL can be configured in the same way as Reply.

CAVEATS
    I imagine this probably breaks pretty badly in a multi-threaded or
    multi-process scenario.
