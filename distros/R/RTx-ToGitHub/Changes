- Call CPAN::Meta->load_file to load a meta file instead of
  CPAN::Meta->new. Patch by Michiel Beijen. GitHub #3.


0.07     2016-11-13

- Added a --debug-ua flag. When enabled this uses LWP::ConsoleLogger to dump
  the interaction with RT.

- Handle a failure to find a user associated with an RT ticket or transaction
  gracefully. Apparently it's possible for the Creator field for a transaction
  to contain an email that's no longer in RT.


0.06     2016-11-13

- Really fix the default repo. This distro could really use some tests.


0.05     2016-11-13

- The default repo generated when prompts were enabled would include both the
  user/org name and the repo name, when it should just be the repo name.


0.04     2016-11-13

- Added a shebang line to rt-to-github.pl

- The metacpan-github-names.pl will no longer be installed. This is only used
  for development.


0.03     2016-11-12

- Added a --test option that you should use when testing a conversion. This
  sets --force and --no-resolve. It also changes how ticket bodies are
  formatted to avoid @mentioning people.

- Fixed links to attachments with spaces and other characters that needed URI
  escaping.

- Also include tickets with a status of "patched".

- Added a monkey patch to work around
  https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=118729, which caused some ticket
  or comment bodies to be lost entirely.


0.02     2016-11-06

- Fix order of POD sections in the docs.


0.01     2016-11-06

- First release upon an unsuspecting world.
