NAME
    Number::Continuation - Create number continuations

SYNOPSIS
     use Number::Continuation qw(continuation);

     $set = '1 2 3 6 7 10 11 12 14';
     @set = (1,2,3,6,7,10,11,12,14);

     $contin = continuation($set);
     @contin = continuation($set);

     $contin = continuation(@set);
     @contin = continuation(@set);

     $contin = continuation(\@set);
     @contin = continuation(\@set);

     $contin = continuation($set, { delimiter => '[]', range => '~', separator => ';' });
     ...

     __OUTPUT__

     scalar context ($contin): '1-3, 6-7, 10-12, 14';
     list   context (@contin): [1,2,3], [6,7], [10,11,12], [14];

DESCRIPTION
  continuation
     continuation($set | @set | \@set [, { options } ])

    Returns in scalar context a stringified representation of a number
    continuation. In list context a two-dimensional array is returned where
    each entry represents a list of numbers that belong to a single
    continuation or which does not belong to a continuation at all.

    Continuation ranges may be negative.

    It takes optionally a hash reference as last argument containing the
    parameters "delimiter", "range" and "separator". "delimiter" may contain
    two characters, where first one is prepended to the beginning of a
    continuation and the second one appended to the end; "range" may consist
    of one or two characters which are being inserted between the beginning
    and end of a continuation; "separator" may be set to a single character
    which ends a continuation.

    "delimiter", "range" and "separator" aren't mandatory parameters. If
    options aren't defined, a reasonable default will be assumed.

EXPORT
    "continuation()" is exportable.
