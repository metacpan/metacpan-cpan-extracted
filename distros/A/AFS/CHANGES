   AFS version 3.4.x, 3.5.x, 3.6.x and with the AFS system libraries
   for all OpenAFS versions.
 * number of available platforms have increased. Since OpenAFS is
   running on an increasingly number of platforms so does the AFS Perl
   module.  Everywhere you can compile OpenAFS and Perl you should be
   able to install the ASF Perl module.
 * corrected Constructor Methods for all AFS classes.  The constructor
   methods for all AFS classes have been corrected to conform with the
   Perl OO conventions.
 * module structure has been changed.  In order to have clean Perl
   interfaces the AFS Perl code has been separated into several
   logical modules.  All modules have been implemented as OO classes.

   functions from version 1 are still available for compatibility, but
   are deprecated.  These cases have been marked in the documentation.
