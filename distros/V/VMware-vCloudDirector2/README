VERSION

    version 0.107

SYNOPSIS

        # THIS IS AT AN EARLY STAGE OF DEVELOPMENT - PROTOTYPING REALLY
        # IT MAY CHANGE DRAMATICALLY OR EAT YOUR DATA.
    
        use VMware::vCloudDirector2
    
        my $vcd = VMware::vCloudDirector2->new(
            hostname   => $host,
            username   => $user,
            password   => $pass,
            orgname    => $org,
            ssl_verify => 0,
        );
        my @org_list = $vcd->org_list;

 Attributes

  hostname

    Hostname of the vCloud server. Must have a vCloud instance listening
    for https on port 443.

  username

    Username to use to login to vCloud server.

  password

    Password to use to login to vCloud server.

  orgname

    Org name to use to login to vCloud server - this defaults to System.

  timeout

    Command timeout in seconds. Defaults to 120.

  default_accept_header

    The default MIME types to accept. This is automatically set based on
    the information received back from the API versions.

  ssl_verify

    Whether to do standard SSL certificate verification. Defaults to set.

  ssl_ca_file

    The SSL CA set to trust packaged in a file. This defaults to those set
    in the Mozilla::CA

  debug

    Set debug level. The higher the debug level, the more chatter is
    exposed.

    Defaults to 0 (no output) unless the environment variable
    VCLOUD_API_DEBUG is set to something that is non-zero. Picked up at
    create time in BUILD()

 Methods

  org_list

    Returns a set of VMware::vCloudDirector2::Object each containing one of
    the vCloud Orgs on the system (or if using this in user mode the single
    org you can see).

  query

    Returns a VMware::vCloudDirector2::Object containing the query result
    of the query against the platform.

DESCRIPTION

    Thinish wrapper of the VMware vCloud Director REST API.

    This differs from VMware::vCloudDirector in that it uses the JSON
    flavoured version of the API, which has subtly different naming
    conventions (which is why I didn't try to make the code handle both
    flavours), but is much easier to work with when doing write operations.

    It also can do write operations - as well as the other issues in
    VMware::vCloudDirector it looks like the write operations - PUT, POST
    and DELETE have never worked!

    THIS IS AT AN EARLY STAGE OF DEVELOPMENT - PROTOTYPING REALLY - AND MAY
    CHANGE DRAMATICALLY OR EAT YOUR DATA.

    The lack of documentation reflects the stage in development...
