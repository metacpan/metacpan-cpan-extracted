NAME
    Apache2::EmbedMP3 - Embed MP3 audio files into a templated web interface
    using WP Audio Player.

SYNOPSIS
    On your Apache configuration file:

     <Files ~ "\.mp3$">
       SetHandler modperl
       PerlSetVar wpaudioplayer /audio-player/player.swf
       PerlSetVar wpaudioplayer_js /audio-player/wpaudioplayer.js
       PerlResponseHandler Apache2::EmbedMP3
     </Files>

    If you want to restrict only a certain directory to serve MP3s using
    "Apache2::EmbedMP3", you can wrap the "Files" declaration on a
    "Directory" block. For more information, take a look at excellent
    Apache2's documentation.

    By default, you have to have "/wpaudioplayer.swf" and
    "/wpaudioplayer.js" accessible on your webserver. You can download WP
    Audio Player from <http://wpaudioplayer.com/>, you only need the main JS
    file and the SWF. WP Audio Player is a nice GPL product.

    However, as specified on the SYNOPSIS, you can override these default
    behavior and "PerlSetVar" "wpaudioplayer" and "wpaudioplayer_js" to
    point wherever you'd have them.

    That's it. Just go to any MP3 file within your web server. With that
    setup, "Apache2::EmbedMP3" will use a default template.

TEMPLATING
    Take a look at the default template located at example/template.tt. That
    is not the real file used by this module but it's a verbatim copy. The
    file is placed there just as an example so you can make your own
    template without too much internal poking.

    Once you have your own template, just "PerlSetVar" it to the handler:

     <Files ~ "\.mp3$">
       SetHandler modperl
       PerlSetVar template /path/to/my/template.tt
       PerlResponseHandler Apache2::EmbedMP3
     </Files>

    A more complete example:

     <Files ~ "\.mp3$">
       SetHandler modperl
       PerlSetVar template /path/to/my/template.tt
       PerlSetVar wpaudioplayer /somewhere/wpaudioplayer.swf
       # or...
       PerlSetVar wpaudioplayer_js http://my.other.server/rocks/wpaudioplayer.js
       PerlResponseHandler Apache2::EmbedMP3
    </Files>

    I believe it's pretty obvious that the templating system used and
    required is Template::Toolkit. Wherever you want to embed the player
    within, just call: "[% player %]".

DESCRIPTION
    "Apache2::EmbledMP3" has been already described on the previous section
    :-)

    However...

    "Apache2::EmbedMP3" enables Apache to show MP3 files using WP Audio
    Player. This will ease any deployment of MP3 galleries you'd need to do
    since you could just put the MP3s on an Apache accessible location, and
    they will be presented on a proper way to your final user.

    Additionally, the following information for the files is available:

    *   artist

    *   title

    *   album name

    *   album year

    *   lyrics!

    These are presented by the default template and you can use them too on
    your own templates. This information is possible by using
    Music::Tag::MP3.

DEPENDENCIES
    *   Music::Tag::MP3

    *   Music::Tag::Lyrics

BUGS
    Apparently, there's a bug if the filename of your MP3 contains spaces.
    This will be tracked later.

        template.
