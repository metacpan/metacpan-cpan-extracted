WordNet::QueryData perl module
------------------------------

WordNet::QueryData provides a direct interface to the WordNet database
files.  It requires the WordNet package
(http://wordnet.princeton.edu/).  It allows the user direct access to
the full WordNet semantic lexicon.  All parts of speech are supported
and access is generally very efficient because the index and morphical
exclusion tables are loaded at initialization.  This initialization
step is slow (appx. 10-15 seconds), but queries are very fast
thereafter---thousands of queries can be completed every second.

PREREQUISITES
-------------

- Perl5
- WordNet Database Package version 3.0

DOCUMENTATION
-------------

Make sure to read the included man page ("perldoc QueryData.pm" or
"perldoc WordNet::QueryData" to extract).

The ChangeLog file lists a summary of changes to the code.

See http://groups.google.com/group/wn-perl for information on the mailing list.

WINDOWS INSTALLATION
--------------------

This assumes that perl was installed to the default location (C:\perl).

  0) Make sure that you have installed WordNet to C:\Program Files\WordNet\3.0
  1) Unpack the WordNet QueryData distribution
  2) Create the directory C:\perl\site\lib\WordNet
  3) Copy QueryData.pm to C:\perl\site\lib\WordNet
  4) Run "perl test.pl" to test the installation

Alternatively, you can install NMake and use the Make installation steps.
See http://johnbokma.com/perl/make-for-windows.html for info on NMake.

MAKE INSTALLATION
-----------------

Installation uses the perl MakeMaker utility ('perldoc
ExtUtils::MakeMaker').  To build and test the distribution do:

     perl Makefile.PL
     make
     make test

If "perl Makefile.PL" breaks or "make test" doesn't work at all ("not ok 1"),
you may not have the WNHOME or WNSEARCHDIR environment variables defined
correctly.  Read the QueryData manual page ("perldoc QueryData.pm") to find out
how to tell it where your WordNet database is located (you'll need to edit
test.pl).  Note that if you are are using Debian/Ubuntu and have the standard
wordnet package installed , you should set WNSEARCHDIR to /usr/share/wordnet.

If any of the tests fail, send e-mail to the wn-perl mailing list (see
DOCUMENTATION).

If the tests run okay, install with (this may need to be run as root):

     make install

CUSTOM DIRECTORY
----------------

To install WordNet::QueryData in /foo/bar/baz do:

mkdir /foo/bar/baz/WordNet
cp QueryData.pm /foo/bar/baz/WordNet

Make sure to add /foo/bar/baz to perl's @INC variable (e.g. -I/foo/bar/baz)

KNOWN BUGS

validForms does not implement WordNet's morphological processing
correctly.  Only the first element of the list returned by validForms
is guaranteed to be valid.  Later elements may not be valid.
