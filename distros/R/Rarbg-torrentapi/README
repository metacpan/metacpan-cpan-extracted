DESCRIPTION

    Rarbg::torrentapi is a simple wrapper around Rarbg's torrentapi.

ATTRIBUTES

    Those attributes can be used on all public methods. In fact you can use
    them also when creating the object. Some of them make more sense at
    creation time, some others when calling the method. It's your call.

    The only difference is that you should pass them as an anonymous hash
    if you pass them to a method.

    You can find more info about their values at
    https://torrentapi.org/apidocs_v2.txt

 search_string

 search_imdb

    This is the Imdb id (http://imdb.com) in the form 'tt123456'

 search_themoviedb

 category

    Category can be quite confusing. It accepts 'tv' and 'movies'. But, for
    the rest of categories only accepts its id numbers (or a semi-colon
    separated list of them).
