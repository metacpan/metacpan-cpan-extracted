This module creates lexical aliases to items that can be either lexical or
dynamic. For example, after this statement:

    my $foo := $array[2];

both $foo and $array[2] refer to the same value. If you take references to both
items, you'll discover that \$foo eq \$array[2]. Changing either of them changes
the other.

You can also alias entire arrays or hashes:

    my @bar := @$arrayref;
    my %baz := %{$hoh{'element1'}->{'subelement'}};

You can also alias the contents of an array or a hash, or an array or hash
slice.

    my ($foo, @bar, %baz) := *@array;

In the above, $array[1] must be an array reference, and $array[2] must be a hash
reference.

When aliasing the contents of a hash, the names of the aliased variables
determine the hash members that are aliased.  The following two statements have
identical effects.

    my ($foo, @bar, %baz) := *%hash;
    my ($foo, @bar, %baz) := @hash{qw/foo bar baz/};

This version is still an alpha version, released so that I can get some feedback
on bugs and on the general functionality of the module.

Version 0.02 fixed some minor problems.

Version 0.03 gets the prerequisites right in Makefile.PL.

Version 0.04 corrects a number of bugs, and updates the prerequisite
for PadWalker to 0.09.

Version 0.05 checks to see if a hash element exists before attempting
to create an alias for it, and modifies the tests to skip several of them
due to a problem in PadWalker with Perl 5.8.x.

Version 0.06 fixes a long-standing problem with bindings in recursive
subroutines. Basically, the underlying XS code was always binding the variable
in the first call, not the one at the current stack level.
