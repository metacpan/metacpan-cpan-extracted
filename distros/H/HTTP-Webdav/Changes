   - Works now with and include new functions of neon 0.17.1

0.1.17

0.1.16

    - Works now with neon 0.16.1

    - Make return parameter from options methods available

0.1.14

    - Add DESTROY methods for all classes (before we had only
      DESTROY for classes that calls ne_destroy_xxx), so we
      are sure memory and internal data structures are cleaned
      up correctly.

0.1.13

    - tested against neon 0.15.1

0.1.12

    - remove request_ prefix for HTTP::Webdav::Request methods
    - all *destroy* methods are now called DESTROY, so they are
      called automaticly when the Perl variables that holds the
      object goes out of scope.
    - DESTORY methods now clears up some internaly datastructures
      to avoid memory leaks.
