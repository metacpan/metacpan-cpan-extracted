Pg-Pcurse version 0.01
======================

These libraries support pcurse(1), the script that monitors a 
Postgres database cluster, it shows statistics on tables, indexes,
vacuuming, buffers, etc,. 

USAGE

Documentation for usage is described inside the USAGE file, or 
in the pcurse(1) pod .

INSTALLATION

This module depends on Curses and Curses::Widgets . If you
have problems installing them, it is probably you are
missing the header files for libcurses. Debian-bases distributions
will need the libncurses5-dev  package:

$ apt-get install libncurses5-dev

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

This will also install the pcurse(1) script. The first thing you
need to perform is to supply  the correct parameter to pcurse(1)
in order to connect to your Postgres server, something like this:

$ pcurse --host  localhost --user john --passwd apple ,
or
$ pcurse -h localhost --password apple 

---------------------------------------------------------------------
pcurse(1) must connect to the Postgres server in order to do anything.
At startup, pcurse(1) tests if your login is valid before executing any
graphics that might mess up the terminal.  I took great care not to
mess up your screen; in the most unlikely event that the program exits 
abnormally and fails to restore the screen, you can always reset your 
terminal by typing 'reset'.
