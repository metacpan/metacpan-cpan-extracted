DESCRIPTION
    Gepok is a PSGI server implementation. Its features are:

    *   HTTPS support out-of-the-box

        This is the primary (if not the only) reason why I wrote Gepok, and
        why it uses HTTP::Daemon::* family (because there is
        HTTP::Daemon::SSL). I needed a pure-Perl standalone webserver with
        SSL support builtin. Other Perl servers usually recommend running
        behind Nginx or some other external HTTPS proxy.

    *   Preforking

        Good performance and reliability.

    *   Multiple interface and Unix socket

    *   Runs on Unix platform

    Gepok can run under plackup, or standalone.

PSGI ENVIRONMENT
    Gepok adds the following server-specific keys in the PSGI environment
    passed to application/middleware:

    *   gepok.connect_time => ARRAY

        A 2-element arrayref (produced by Time::HiRes' gettimeofday()),
        clocked at connect time.

    *   gepok.finish_request_time => ARRAY

        A 2-element arrayref (produced by Time::HiRes' gettimeofday()),
        clocked right after Gepok has received the complete request from
        client.

    *   gepok.client_protocol => STR

        HTTP protocol version sent by client, e.g. "HTTP/1.0" or "HTTP/1.1".
        This can be used to avoid sending HTTP/1.1 response to HTTP/1.0 or
        older clients.

    *   gepok.socket => OBJ

        Raw HTTP::Daemon::ClientConn socket. Can be used to get information
        about socket, e.g. peerport(), etc. Should not be used to read/write
        data (use PSGI way for that, e.g. $env->{'psgi.input'}, returning
        PSGI response, etc).

    *   gepok.httpd_socket => OBJ

        Raw HTTP::Daemon socket. Can be used to get information about
        socket, e.g. peercred() (for UNIX sockets), etc. Should not be used
        to return HTTP response directly (use PSGI way for that).

    *   gepok.unix_socket => BOOL

        A boolean value which is set to true if client connects via Unix
        socket. (Note, you can get Unix socket path from $env->{SERVER_NAME}
        or $env->{'gepok.socket'}).

ATTRIBUTES
  name => STR (default is basename of $0)
    Name of server, for display in process table ('ps ax').

  daemonize => BOOL (default 1)
    Whether to daemonize (go into background).

  http_ports => ARRAY OF STR (default [])
    One or more HTTP ports to listen to. Default is none. Each port can be
    in the form of N, ":N", "0.0.0.0:N" (all means the same thing, to bind
    to all interfaces) or "1.2.3.4:N" (to bind to a specific network
    interface).

    A string is also accepted, it will be split (delimiter ,) beforehand.

  https_ports => ARRAY OF STR (default [])
    Just like http_ports, but for specifying ports for HTTPS.

  unix_sockets => ARRAY OF STR (default [])
    Location of Unix sockets. Default is none, which means not listening to
    Unix socket. Each element should be an absolute path.

    A string is also accepted, it will be split (delimiter ,) beforehand.

    You must at least specify one port (either http, https, unix_socket) or
    Gepok will refuse to run.

  timeout => BOOL (default 120)
    Socket timeout. Will be passed as Timeout option to HTTP::Daemon's
    constructor (which will be passed to IO::Socket).

  require_root => BOOL (default 0)
    Whether to require running as root.

    Passed to Proc::Daemon::Prefork's constructor.

  pid_path => STR (default /var/run/<name>.pid or ~/<name>.pid)
    Location of PID file.

  scoreboard_path => STR (default /var/run/<name>.scoreboard or ~/<name>.scoreboard)
    Location of scoreboard file (used for communication between parent and
    child processes). If you disable this, autoadjusting number of children
    won't work (number of children will be kept at 'start_servers').

  error_log_path => STR (default /var/log/<name>-error.log or ~/<name>-error.log)
    Location of error log. Default is /var/log/<name>-error.log. It will be
    opened in append mode.

  access_log_path => STR (default /var/log/<name>-access.log or ~/<name>-access.log)
    Location of access log. It will be opened in append mode.

    Default format of access log is the Apache combined format. Override
    access_log() method if you wan't to customize this.

    If Gepok is run Under plackup, by default it will not write an access
    log file (unless you specify this attribute) since plackup already
    writes an access log.

  ssl_key_file => STR
    Path to SSL key file, to be passed to HTTP::Daemon::SSL. If you specify
    one or more HTTPS ports, you need to supply this.

  ssl_cert_file => STR
    Path to SSL cert file, to be passed to HTTP::Daemon::SSL. If you specify
    one or more HTTPS ports, you need to supply this.

  ssl_verify_mode => INT
    Level of verification for SSL client certificates, to be passed to
    HTTP::Daemon::SSL. This is optional.

  ssl_verify_callback => CODEREF
    Custom verifier for SSL client certificates, to be passed to
    HTTP::Daemon::SSL. This is optional.

  ssl_ca_file => STR
    Path for file containing certificates of reputable authorties for
    certificate verification. This is optional.

  ssl_ca_path => STR
    According to IO::Socket::SSL this is only of interest if you are
    "unusually friendly with the OpenSSL documentation". This is optional.

  start_servers => INT (default 3)
    Number of children to fork at the start of run. If you set this to 0,
    the server becomes a nonforking one.

    Tip: You can set start_servers to 0 and 'daemonize' to false for
    debugging.

  max_clients => INT (default 150)
    Maximum number of children processes to maintain. If server is busy,
    number of children will be increased from the original 'start_servers'
    up until this value.

  max_requests_per_child => INT (default 1000)
    Number of requests each child will serve until it exists.

  product_name => STR
    Used in 'Server' HTTP response header (<product_name>/<version>).
    Defaults to class name, e.g. "Gepok".

  product_version => STR
    Used in 'Server' HTTP response header (<product_name>/<version>).
    Defaults to $VERSION package variable.

METHODS
  new(%args)
    Create a new instance of server. %args can be used to set attributes.

  $gepok->run($app)
    Start/run server and run the PSGI application $app.

  $gepok->start($app)
    Alias for run().

  $gepok->stop()
    Stop running server.

  $gepok->restart()
    Restart server.

  $gepok->is_running() => BOOL
    Check whether server is running.

  $gepok->before_prefork()
    This is a hook provided for subclasses to do something before the daemon
    is preforking. For example, you can preload Perl modules here so that
    each child doesn't have to load modules separately (= inefficient).

  $gepok->access_log($req, $res, $sock)
    The default implementation uses the Apache combined format. Override if
    you want custom format. $res is HTTP::Request object, $res is PSGI
    response, $sock is the raw socket.

FAQ
  Why the name Gepok?
    Gepok is an Indonesian word, meaning bundle/bunch. This class bundles
    one or several HTTP::Daemon::* objects to create a stand-alone web
    server.

  Why use Gepok?
    The main feature for Gepok is builtin HTTPS support, which means you do
    not have to setup a separate front-end HTTPS proxy for serving content
    over HTTPS. This is convenient, especially for development. Builtin
    HTTPS support also makes some things easier to, e.g. check client
    certificates you can use the ssl_verify_callback options. Your PSGI
    application also has direct access to the raw socket
    ("$env->{'gepok.socket'}").

    However, for heavy traffic use, you might want to check out more
    battle-tested solution like Perlbal.

    There are now other PSGI servers that support HTTPS, see the SEE ALSO
    section.

    I personally developed Gepok for two reasons: HTTPS support and
    listening on Unix sockets.

  Performance notes?
    Thanks to preforking, Gepok has adequate performance and reliability
    handling multiple clients. But Gepok is not yet performance-tuned, or
    very performance-oriented to begin with. For convenience Gepok is based
    on HTTP::Daemon, which is also not too performance-oriented. For each
    HTTP request, HTTP::Daemon constructs an HTTP::Request object, which
    copies request body into a scalar (and, for PSGI, needs to be
    re-presented as a stream using IO::Scalar). Creating other objects like
    URI and HTTP::Headers are also involved. Gepok also creates file-based
    scoreboard, which might or might not be a bottleneck.

    Casual benchmarking on my PC shows that Gepok is about 3-4x slower than
    Starman for "hello world" PSGI.

    I am using Gepok primarily with Perinci::Access::HTTP::Server for
    serving remote API requests, in which HTTPS support is required.

  "Bad arg length for Socket::inet_ntoa, length is 16, should be 4" error
    At the time of this writing, HTTP::Daemon (6.01) might throw this error
    message when receiving request. For patches/solutions to overcome this
    problem, see: https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=71395

    *   Plack::Handler::AnyEvent::HTTPD

        As of Aug 2012 still needs a patch to allow SSL, see

        ecomment-7046948

    Note that any PSGI server can be used if you setup a front-end HTTPS
    proxy/load balancer.

    Please drop me a message if you think other PSGI servers need to be
    mentioned.
