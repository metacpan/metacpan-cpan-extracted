NAME
    Data::Dump::Ruby

VERSION
    version 0.02

SYNOPSIS
     use Data::Dump::Ruby qw(dump_ruby ddx_ruby);

     # in Perl
     $str = dump_ruby($var);

     # in Ruby
     var = eval str

     # or use it for easy debug printout
     ddx_ruby localtime;

DESCRIPTION
    This module provide functions that takes a list of values as their
    argument and produces a string as its result. The string contains Ruby
    code that, when "eval"ed, produces a deep copy of the original
    arguments.

    The main feature of the module is that it strives to produce output that
    is easy to read. Example:

        @a = (1, [2, 3], {4 => 5});
        dump_ruby(@a);

    Produces:

        [1, [2, 3], {4 => 5}]

    If you dump just a little data, it is output on a single line. If you
    dump data that is more complex or there is a lot of it, line breaks are
    automatically added to keep it easy to read.

    The following functions are provided (only the dd* functions are
    exported by default):

    dump_ruby( ... )
    pp_ruby( ... )
        Returns a string containing a Ruby expression/code. If you pass this
        string to Ruby's eval(), it should return a copy of the arguments
        you passed to dump_ruby().

        If you call the function with multiple arguments then the output
        will be wrapped in an outer array [ ..., ..., ... ]. If you call the
        function with a single argument the output will not have the
        wrapping. If you call the function with a single scalar
        (non-reference) argument it will just return the scalar quoted if
        needed, but never break it into multiple lines. If you pass multiple
        arguments or references to arrays of hashes then the return value
        might contain line breaks to format it for easier reading. The
        returned string will never be "\n" terminated, even if contains
        multiple lines. This allows Ruby code like this to place the
        semicolon in the expected place:

           print 'obj = ', $res, "\n;"

        If dump_ruby() is called in void context, then the dump is printed
        on STDERR and then "\n" terminated. You might find this useful for
        quick debug printouts, but the dd*() functions might be better
        alternatives for this.

        There is no difference between dump_ruby() and pp_ruby().

    quote_ruby( $string )
        Returns a quoted version of the provided string.

        It differs from "dd_ruby($string)" in that it will quote even
        numbers and not try to come up with clever expressions that might
        shorten the output.

    dd_ruby( ... )
    ddx_ruby( ... )
        These functions will call dump_ruby() on their argument and print
        the result to STDOUT (actually, it's the currently selected output
        handle, but STDOUT is the default for that).

        The difference between them is only that ddx_ruby() will prefix the
        lines it prints with "# " and mark the first line with the file and
        line number where it was called. This is meant to be useful for
        debug printouts of state within programs.

NAME
    Data::Dump::Ruby - Pretty printing of data structures as Ruby code

BUGS/LIMITATIONS
    Code references will be displayed as simply "(Proc.new {})" when dumped.
    Thus, "eval"ing them will not reproduce the original routine.

    Regexes in Ruby by default are multilines (e.g. /^foo/ in Perl means
    /\Afoo/ in Ruby and /^foo/m in Perl means /^foo/ in Ruby), this is not
    adjusted yet.

SEE ALSO
    Data::Dump and Data::Dump::PHP (from which this codebase is based)

    JSON, YAML - Another alternative to exchange data with Ruby (and other
    languages) is to export/import via YAML and JSON.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
    Data::Dump::Ruby is a quick hack. I simply copied the code from
    Data::Dump::PHP, which was copied from Gisle Ass' wonderful "Data::Dump"
    and changed only whatever is necessary.
