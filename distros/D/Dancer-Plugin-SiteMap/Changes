0.12    05/12/2013 14:41:00
        Bugfix for RT #91176.
        The SiteMap was duplicating entries when the AJAX plugin was in use
        and ajax and get routes were declared for the same path. Which while
        technically not a bug, as it was doing what it was supposed to, it's
        undesirable, and as such has been patched out.

        Added support for Dancer 2 - Official the first Dancer plugin
        to seemlessly support both versions of the framework! :-)
