<P><EM>Portable Presenter</EM> is a package designed to give presentations.
It is written in <A HREF=http://www.perl.org>Perl</A>/Tk only, which is
available for UNIX and for Windows.
<EM>Portable Presenter</EM> is brought to you under the same licences as
Perl, which is GPL and the Artistic Licence.</P>

<P>PPresenter is not really for the week of heart.  The results are limited
to what Tk can deliver, but that is quite a lot.  You can write presentations
using Perl (do you know Perl?) and XML (so how hard can it be?)
Please contribute.</P>

<P>The current version is v1.17 (published 2002/08/12).  My advice
is to use this in combination with Tk800.022, which seems stable for
some time now.</P>

<H2>Main <A NAME=features>features</A></H2>
Are you also frustrated by the massive amount of images and menus which
most WYSIWYG presentation programs show you?  Do you prefer LaTeX over
M$-Word and you are not affraid to type?  Then this program may be
the thing you were waiting for.
<P>
PPresenter features:
<UL>
<LI>Write your presentation (slides) in Object Oriented Perl: you write it
    as a perl program, which runs <FONT COLOR=green><B>equivalent on any UNIX
    and Windows32</B></FONT>, however, not all facilities are available under
    Windows.

<H2>What is <A NAME=not>NOT</A> in</H2>
<EM>Portable Presenter</EM> is limited to the functionality of Perl/Tk.
Although Tk is very well suited for most jobs, some features which are
possible with fully C-written applications are not implemented.  In some
cases, the performance would be too low to give an acceptable result.
<UL>
<LI>No fading in/out or fading from one into the next slide;
<LI>... ehhh... must be more, but most is solvable (i.e. to be solved),
    one way or the other.
</UL>
