	If the script has been modified since the value in IF_MODIFIED_SINCE
		don't return 304, since the output may have been changed
	If the script has been modified since the time it was stored in the cache
		don't return true from is_cached()

		and subsequent check didn't

0.46	Sat Jun  2 14:02:39 EDT 2012
