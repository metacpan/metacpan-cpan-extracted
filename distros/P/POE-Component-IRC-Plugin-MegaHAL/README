NAME
    POE::Component::IRC::Plugin::MegaHAL - A PoCo-IRC plugin which provides
    access to a MegaHAL conversation simulator.

SYNOPSIS
    To quickly get an IRC bot with this plugin up and running, you can use
    App::Pocoirc:

     $ pocoirc -s irc.perl.org -j '#bots' -a MegaHAL

    Or use it in your code:

     use POE::Component::IRC::Plugin::MegaHAL;
 
     $irc->plugin_add('MegaHAL', POE::Component::IRC::Plugin::MegaHAL->new(
         Own_channel    => '#bot_chan',
         English        => 1,
         Ignore_regexes => [ qr{^\s*\w+://\S+\s*$} ], # ignore URL-only lines
     ));

DESCRIPTION
    POE::Component::IRC::Plugin::MegaHAL is a POE::Component::IRC plugin. It
    provides "intelligence" through the use of POE::Component::AI::MegaHAL.
    It will talk back when addressed by channel members (and possibly in
    other situations, see "new"). An example:

     --> megahal_bot joins #channel
     <Someone> oh hi there
     <Other> hello there
     <Someone> megahal_bot: hi
     <megahal_bot> oh hi there

    It will occasionally send CTCP ACTIONS (/me) too, if the reply in
    question happens to be based on an earlier CTCP ACTION from someone.

    All NOTICEs are ignored, so if your other bots only issue NOTICEs like
    they should, they will be ignored automatically.

    Before using, you should read the documentation for
    POE::Component::AI::MegaHAL and by extension, AI::MegaHAL, so you have
    an idea of what to pass as the 'MegaHAL_args' parameter to "new".

    This plugin requires the IRC component to be POE::Component::IRC::State
    or a subclass thereof.

METHODS
  "new"
    Takes the following optional arguments:

    'MegaHAL', a reference to an existing POE::Component::AI::MegaHAL object
    you have lying around. Useful if you want to use it with multiple IRC
    components. If this argument is not provided, the plugin will construct
    its own object.

    'MegaHAL_args', a hash reference containing arguments to pass to the
    constructor of a new POE::Component::AI::MegaHAL object.

    'Channels', an array reference of channel names. If this is provided,
    the bot will only listen/respond in the specified channels, rather than
    all channels.

    'Own_channel', a channel where it will reply to all messages, as well as
    greet everyone who joins. The plugin will take care of joining the
    channel. It will part from it when the plugin is removed from the
    pipeline. Defaults to none.

    'Abuse_interval', default is 60 (seconds), which means that user X in
    channel Y has to wait that long before addressing the bot in the same
    channel if he wants to get a reply. Setting this to 0 effectively turns
    off abuse protection.

    'Talkative', when set to a true value, the bot will respond whenever
    someone mentions its name (in a PRIVMSG or CTCP ACTION (/me)). If false,
    it will only respond when addressed directly with a PRIVMSG. Default is
    false.

    'Ignore_masks', an array reference of IRC masks (e.g. "purl!*@*") to
    ignore.

    'Ignore_regexes', an array reference of regex objects. If a message
    matches any of them, it will be ignored. Handy for ignoring messages
    with URLs in them.

    'Method', how you want messages to be delivered. Valid options are
    'notice' (the default) and 'privmsg'.

    'English', when set to a true value, some English-language corrections
    will be applied to the bot's output. Currently it will capitalizes the
    word 'I' and make sure paragraphs end with '.' where appropriate.
    Defaults to false.

    Returns a plugin object suitable for feeding to POE::Component::IRC's
    plugin_add() method.

  "brain"
    Takes no arguments. Returns the underlying POE::Component::AI::MegaHAL
    object being used by the plugin.

  "transplant"
    Replaces the brain with the supplied POE::Component::AI::MegaHAL
    instance. Shuts down the old brain if it was instantiated by the plugin
    itself.
