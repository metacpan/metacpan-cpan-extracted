NAME
    Module::Install::TestML - Module::Install Support for TestML

SYNOPSIS
        use inc::Module::Install;

        name     'Foo';
        all_from 'lib/Foo.pm';

        use_testml_tap;

        WriteAll;

DESCRIPTION
    This module adds the "use_testml_tap" directive to Module::Install.

    Now you can get full TestML support for your module with no external
    dependency on TestML.

    Just add this line to your Makefile.PL:

        use_testml_tap;

    That's it. Really. Now Test::Base is bundled into your module, so that
    it is no longer any burden on the person installing your module.
