=head1 NAME

Devel::ThreadsForks - check for availability of threads or forks

=head1 VERSION

This documentation describes version 0.08.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 # before
 BEGIN { eval "use Devel::ThreadsForks" }

 # after
 BEGIN { eval "use Devel::ThreadsForks; 1" or do "threadsforks" }
 # "threadsforks" written and added to MANIFEST

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The Devel::ThreadsForks module only serves a purpose in the development
environment of an author of a CPAN distribution (or more precisely: a user
of the L<ExtUtils::MakeMaker> module).  It only needs to be installed on the
development environment of an author of a CPAN distribution.

There are basically three situations in which this module can get called.

=head2 INITIAL RUN BY DEVELOPER

If the developer has Devel::ThreadsForks installed, and adds the line:

 BEGIN { eval "use Devel::ThreadsForks" }

at the start of the Makefile.PL, then running the Makefile.PL will create a
file called "threadsforks" in the current directory.  This file is intended
to be called with a C<do>.  It performs the actual check whether the
L<threads> can run, or whether the L<forks> module has been installed in
case it is running on an unthreaded Perl.

It will also adapt the code in the Makefile.PL itself by changing it to:

 BEGIN { eval "use Devel::ThreadsForks; 1" || do 'threadsforks' }

Finally, it will adapt the MANIFEST by adding the line:

 threadsforks                threads/forks test (Added by Devel::ThreadsForks)

This will cause the check file to be included in any distribution made for
that Makefile.PL.

=head2 LATER RUNS BY DEVELOPER

Any subsequent loading of this module, will just execute the "threadsforks"
file and not do anything else.

=head3 INSTALLATION BY USER

A user trying to install the distribution, will most likely B<not> have the
Devel::ThreadsForks module installed.  This is ok, because then the eval in:

 BEGIN { eval "use Devel::ThreadsForks; 1" or do "threadsforks" }

will fail, and the "threadsforks" file will get executed.  And thus perform
the test in the user environment.  And fail with a message if the version of
Perl is not thread-enabled, or does not have the L<forks> module installed.
