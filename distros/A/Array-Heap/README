NAME
    Array::Heap - treat perl arrays as binary heaps/priority queues

SYNOPSIS
     use Array::Heap;

DESCRIPTION
    There are a multitude of heap and heap-like modules on CPAN, you might
    want to search for /Heap/ and /Priority/ to find many. They implement
    more or less fancy datastructures that might well be what you are
    looking for.

    This module takes a different approach: It exports functions (i.e. no
    object orientation) that are loosely modeled after the C++ STL's binary
    heap functions. They all take an array as argument, just like perl's
    built-in functions "push", "pop" etc.

    The implementation itself is in C for maximum speed.

FUNCTIONS
    All of the following functions are being exported by default.

    make_heap @heap (\@)
        Reorders the elements in the array so they form a heap, with the
        lowest value "on top" of the heap (corresponding to the first array
        element).

    make_heap_idx @heap (\@)
        Just like "make_heap", but updates the index (see INDEXED
        OPERATIONS).

    make_heap_lex @heap (\@)
        Just like "make_heap", but in string comparison order instead of
        numerical comparison order.

    make_heap_cmp { compare } @heap (&\@)
        Just like "make_heap", but takes a custom comparison function.

    push_heap @heap, $element, ... (\@@)
        Adds the given element(s) to the heap.

    push_heap_idx @heap, $element, ... (\@@)
        Just like "push_heap", but updates the index (see INDEXED
        OPERATIONS).

    push_heap_lex @heap, $element, ... (\@@)
        Just like "push_heap", but in string comparison order instead of
        numerical comparison order.

    push_heap_cmp { compare } @heap, $element, ... (&\@@)
        Just like "push_heap", but takes a custom comparison function.

    pop_heap @heap (\@)
        Removes the topmost (lowest) heap element and repairs the heap.

    pop_heap_idx @heap (\@)
        Just like "pop_heap", but updates the index (see INDEXED
        OPERATIONS).

    pop_heap_lex @heap (\@)
        Just like "pop_heap", but in string comparison order instead of
        numerical comparison order.

    pop_heap_cmp { compare } @heap (&\@)
        Just like "pop_heap", but takes a custom comparison function.

    splice_heap @heap, $index (\@$)
        Similar to "pop_heap", but removes and returns the element at index
        $index.

    splice_heap_idx @heap, $index (\@$)
        Just like "splice_heap", but updates the index (see INDEXED
        OPERATIONS).

    splice_heap_lex @heap, $index (\@$)
        Just like "splice_heap", but in string comparison order instead of
        numerical comparison order.

    splice_heap_cmp { compare } @heap, $index (&\@$)
        Just like "splice_heap", but takes a custom comparison function.

    adjust_heap @heap, $index (\@$)
        Assuming you have only changed the element at index $index, repair
        the heap again. Can be used to remove elements, replace elements,
        adjust the priority of elements and more.

    adjust_heap_idx @heap, $index (\@$)
        Just like "adjust_heap", but updates the index (see INDEXED
        OPERATIONS).

    adjust_heap_lex @heap, $index (\@$)
        Just like "adjust_heap", but in string comparison order instead of
        numerical comparison order.

    adjust_heap_cmp { compare } @heap, $index (&\@$)
        Just like "adjust_heap", but takes a custom comparison function.

  COMPARISON FUNCTIONS
    All the functions come in two flavours: one that uses the built-in
    comparison function and one that uses a custom comparison function.

    The built-in comparison function can either compare scalar numerical
    values (string values for *_lex functions), or array refs. If the
    elements to compare are array refs, the first element of the array is
    used for comparison, i.e.

      1, 4, 6

    will be sorted according to their numerical value,

      [1 => $obj1], [2 => $obj2], [3 => $obj3]

    will sort according to the first element of the arrays, i.e. "1,2,3".

    The custom comparison functions work similar to how "sort" works: $a and
    $b are set to the elements to be compared, and the result should be
    greater than zero then $a is greater than $b, 0 otherwise. This means
    that you can use the same function as for sorting the array, but you
    could also use a simpler function that just does "$a > $b".

    The first example above corresponds to this comparison "function":

      { $a <=> $b }

    And the second example corresponds to this:

      { $a->[0] <=> $b->[0] }

    Unlike "sort", the default sort is numerical and it is not possible to
    use normal subroutines.

  INDEXED OPERATIONS
    The functions whose names end in "_idx" also "update the index". That
    means that all elements must be array refs, with the first element being
    the heap value, and the second value being the array index:

      [$value, $index, ...]

    This allows you to quickly locate an element in the array when all you
    have is the array reference.

BUGS
    *   Numerical comparison is always done using floatingpoint, which
        usually has less precision than a 64 bit integer that perl might use
        for integers internally, resulting in precision loss on the built-in
        comparison.

    *   This module does not work with tied or magical arrays or array
        elements, and, in fact, will even crash when you use those.

    *   This module can leak memory (or worse) when your comparison function
        exits unexpectedly (e.g. "last") or throws an exception, so do not
        do that.

SEE ALSO
    This module has a rather low-level interface. If it seems daunting, you
    should have a look at Array::Heap::ModifiablePriorityQueue, which is
    based on this module but provides more and higher-level operations with
    an object-oriented API which makes it harder to make mistakes.

    A slightly less flexible (only numeric weights), but also slightly
    faster variant of that module can be found as
    Array::Heap::PriorityQueue::Numeric on CPAN.
