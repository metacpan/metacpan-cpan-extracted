DESCRIPTION

    This module provides a filter and a constraint method for use with
    Data::FormValidator, to help make it easier to valid URIs.

METHODS

    FV_uri_filter(%opts)

      Filter method which cleans up the given value as best it can and
      returns something that looks like a URI.

      The filtered URI will be canonicalized, and common typos will be
      corrected.

      Supported options:

      default_scheme

	Default URI scheme to use, if none was provided in the URI

    FV_uri(%opts)

      Constraint method, which ensures that we have a valid URI.

      Supported options:

      schemes

	list-ref of valid schemes

      hostcheck

	host exists in URI and resolves as a valid host? (default off)

      allow_userinfo

	allow user info in URI (default off)
