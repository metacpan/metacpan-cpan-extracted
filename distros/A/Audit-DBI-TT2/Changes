        - Skipped time formatting test for platforms without POSIX::tzset().

v2.1.1  2013-05-21
        - Use fixed indentation in tests, to be able to compare the output.

v2.1.0  2013-05-17
        - Removed Class::Date dependency, replaced by POSIX functions.

v2.0.0  2013-05-14
        - Split Audit::DBI::TT2 off the Audit-DBI distribution, as it adds
          several large dependencies but it is not necessary for the use of
          the audit system itself.
        - Added tests for all the subroutines.

Important: this distribution was previously bundled as part of Audit::DBI, and
was split in v1.8.0. To prevent issues with reindexing in CPAN, Audit::DBI::TT2
starts at v2.0.0.
