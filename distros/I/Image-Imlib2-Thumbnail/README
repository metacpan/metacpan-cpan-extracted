NAME
    Image::Imlib2::Thumbnail - Generate a set of thumbnails of an image

SYNOPSIS
      use Image::Imlib2::Thumbnail;
      my $thumbnail = Image::Imlib2::Thumbnail->new();
  
      # generates a set of thumbnails for $source image in $directory
      my @thumbnails = $thumbnail->generate( $source, $directory );
      foreach my $thumbnail (@thumbnails) {
        my $name = $thumbnail->{name};
        my $width = $thumbnail->{width};
        my $height = $thumbnail->{height};
        my $type = $thumbnail->{type};
        my $filename = $thumbnail->{filename};
        my $mime_type = $thumbnail->{mime_type};
        print "$name/$type/$mime_type is $width x $height at $filename\n";
      }

DESCRIPTION
    This module generates a series of thumbnails of an image using
    Image::Imlib2. If you want to generate a single thumbnail, you should
    look at Image::Imlib2's create_scaled_image method.

    Digital cameras take photos in many different sizes and aspect ratios.
    Photo websites need to display thumbnails of different sizes of these
    photos. This module makes it easy to generate a series of thumbnails of
    an image of the right sizes. It resizes and crops images to match the
    requires size.

    What sizes does it generate? By default it generates thumbnails of the
    same dimension that Flickr generates:

      Type       Name       Width  Height
      Landscape  Square     75     75
      Landscape  Thumbnail  100    75
      Landscape  Small      240    180
      Landscape  Medium     500    375
      Landscape  Large      1024   768
      Portrait   Square     75     75
      Portrait   Thumbnail  75     100
      Portrait   Small      180    240
      Portrait   Medium     375    500
      Portrait   Large      768    1024

    The test suite contains images of every size mentioned on the Wikipedia
    "Digital camera" article:

METHODS
  new
    The constructor:

      my $thumbnail = Image::Imlib2::Thumbnail->new();

  generate
    Generates a set of thumbnails for $source image in $directory. Will also
    include the original image:

      my @thumbnails = $thumbnail->generate( $source, $directory );
      foreach my $thumbnail (@thumbnails) {
        my $name = $thumbnail->{name};
        my $width = $thumbnail->{width};
        my $height = $thumbnail->{height};
        my $type = $thumbnail->{type};
        my $filename = $thumbnail->{filename};
        my $mime_type = $thumbnail->{mime_type};
        print "$name/$type/$mime_type is $width x $height at $filename\n";
      }

  add_size
    Add an extra size:

      $thumbnail->add_size(
          {   type    => 'landscape',
              name    => 'header',
              width   => 350,
              height  => 200,
              quality => 80,
          }
      );

    If width or height are 0, then this retains the aspect ratio and
    performs no cropping.

    The quality is the JPEG quality compression ratio. This defaults to 75.
