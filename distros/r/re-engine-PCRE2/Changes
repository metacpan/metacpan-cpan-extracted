0.13 Thu May 4 13:48:53 2017 +0200 rurban

    - Start handling multi-patterns (#26), like qr + $str + qr

0.12 Wed May 3 09:47:57 2017 +0200 rurban

    - fix op_comp multi patterns without optree, e.g. variable expansion.

    - fix some META data
    - add PCRE2_EXTENDED_MORE /xx support (needs current pcre lib)

0.11 Fri Apr 14 21:49:57 2017 +0200 rurban

    - Support \gG anchors: bypass PCRE2, fallback to core.
    - Partially support /g global matches, passes now all t/perl/pat.t
      tests with >= 5.22
    - t/perl/regexp.t: Support testing single tests,
      Support --core argument without loading PCRE2.

0.10 Wed Apr 12 10:06:21 2017 +0200 rurban

    - Add the new heaplimit method and config option.
    - Fixed make_nametable heap-buffer-overflow (#10)
    - Fixup macports usr vs opt precedence
    - Harmonize the match context names: use the same method name
      for pattern and match_context fields. Some values are stored locally in the
      pattern, some globally in the match context, and some are build-time defaults.

0.09 Tue Apr 11 13:49:30 2017 +0200 rurban

    - Fix split / /, " a b c" special case: don't skip starting whitespace.

0.08 Tue Apr 11 08:35:51 2017 +0200 rurban

    - Support all older libpcre2 versions.
      Tested with 10.00, 10.10, 10.20, 10.21, 10.22, 10.23, 10.30-dev
    - Return undef on unsupported pattern_info methods, not 0:
      framesize, hasbackslashc

0.07 Mon Apr 10 19:13:52 2017 +0200 rurban

    - Fix stack corruption with certain rx size methods on 64bit
    - Added new framesize method if available. If not 0
    - Prepare for compile and match contexts (import options)
    - Simplify XS method implementation
    - Add config and method tests

0.06 Sun Apr 9 11:25:35 2017 +0200 rurban

    - Add BENCHMARKS to documentation: 40% faster

0.05 Sun Apr 9 10:48:20 2017 +0200 rurban

    - Harmonize re_tests with core, add version specifics
    - Document failing tests, with PCRE2 vs older perls.
      It's about the same, when the biggest problem, no utf8 patterns
      with utf8 subjects is fixed. Arguably PCRE2 is even better.

0.04 Fri Apr 7 19:57:46 2017 +0200 rurban

    - add META_MERGE resources, esp. for the bugtracker

0.03 Fri Apr 7 19:38:46 2017 +0200 rurban

    - Minor pod fixes

0.02 Fri Apr 7 11:22:51 2017 +0200 rurban

    - Add many more config functions and pattern methods.
    - Enable the full perl regexp testsuite.
      Only anchored /g regexp's are still failing.
    - Implemented op_comp, with a fallback to core re_engine
      with codeblocks.
    - Add pcre warning when falling back to core re_engine on
      unsupported patterns.

0.01 Wed Apr 5 11:40:18 2017 +0200 rurban
