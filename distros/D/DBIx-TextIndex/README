NAME
    DBIx::TextIndex - Perl extension for full-text searching in SQL
    databases

SYNOPSIS
     use DBIx::TextIndex;

     $index = DBIx::TextIndex->new({
         index_dbh => $index_dbh,
         collection => 'collection_name',
         doc_fields => ['field1', 'field2'],
     });

     $index->initialize();

     $index->add( key1 => { field1 => 'some text', field2 => 'more text' } );

     $results = $index->search({
         field1 => '"a phrase" +and -not or',
         field2 => 'more words',
     });

     foreach my $key
         (sort {$$results{$b} <=> $$results{$a}} keys %$results ) 
     {
         print "Key: $key Score: $$results{$key} \n";
     }

DESCRIPTION
    DBIx::TextIndex was developed for doing full-text searches on BLOB
    columns stored in a database. Almost any database with BLOB and DBI
    support should work with minor adjustments to SQL statements in the
    module. MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite are currently supported.

    As of version 0.24, data from any source outside of a database can be
    indexed by passing the data to the "add()" method as a string.

CHANGES

0.27

    Fixed POD coverage test error

0.26

    Fixed problem with re-indexing a document several times with
    SQLite (rt.cpan.org #16247)

    Stoplists now work with QueryParser

    unscored_search() was returning internal document ids instead of keys

    Fixed table_exists() in case schema name is prefixed to table name
    in results of DBI->tables() call
