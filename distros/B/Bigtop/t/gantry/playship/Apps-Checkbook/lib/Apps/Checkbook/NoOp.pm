=head1 NAME

Apps::Checkbook::NoOp - A controller in the Apps::Checkbook application

=head1 SYNOPSIS

This package is meant to be used in a stand alone server/CGI script or the
Perl block of an httpd.conf file.

Stand Alone Server or CGI script:

    use Apps::Checkbook::NoOp;

    my $cgi = Gantry::Engine::CGI->new( {
        config => {
            #...
        },
        locations => {
            '/someurl' => 'Apps::Checkbook::NoOp',
            #...
        },
    } );

httpd.conf:

    <Perl>
        # ...
        use Apps::Checkbook::NoOp;
    </Perl>

    <Location /someurl>
        SetHandler  perl-script
        PerlHandler Apps::Checkbook::NoOp
    </Location>

If all went well, one of these was correctly written during app generation.
