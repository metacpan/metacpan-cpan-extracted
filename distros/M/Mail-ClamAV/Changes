0.25  Fri Apr 24 14:11:10 CDT 2009

0.16  Fri Mar  4 15:43:20 PST 2005
   - I forgot to run make test before I uploaded :(

0.15  Fri Mar  4 15:43:20 PST 2005
   - A quicky release. Somehow my version of libclamav
     (the latest) can scan the test virus without the
     ZIP option turned on. We now use CL_SCAN_STDOPT
     for all test scans.

0.14  Fri Feb 25 10:27:06 PST 2005
   - The test for scanbuff was broken. Thanks to
     Werner Lemberg <wl [] gnu dot org> for reporting this
   - Fixing this test uncovered a taint bug, fixed.
   - Made the warning in Makefile.PL stand out more.
   - Some doc updates.
   - Bundled Inline::MakeMaker so we no longer fatal on
     missing deps Inline::C.

0.13  Fri Oct 22 06:44:19 PM 2004
   - Updated example code to use the new CL_SCAN_*
     constants.
   - Added CL_SCAN_STDOPT to exports.
   - Added backwards compatible constants.
   Thanks to Mark Martinec <Mark * Martinec [] ijs * si>
     for reporting all these.

0.12  Mon Oct 18 05:22:54 PM 2004
   - 0.80 came out today. Updated code to work with the new
     version, this however breaks backwards compatibility.
   - Updated tests for all the changes.

0.12  Thu Aug 12 02:12:55 PM 2004
   - Fixed an issue in Makefile.PL which was causing problems
     with Solaris make implementation thanks to
     Mike Brudenell <pmb1 [] york * ac * uk>.
   - Added taint checking to scan(). It now croaks if
     a file path passed in is tainted. This only happens
     under -T. Reported by
     Mark Martinec <Mark * Martinec [] ijs * si>
   - Added "+" overload for the status object. Also reported
     by Mark Martinec <Mark * Martinec [] ijs * si>
   - Added tests for the above changes.

0.11  Mon Jun 28 10:26:50 AM 2004
   - Inline_Stack_Item() is indexed at zero. All set/get
     methods are broken because of this mistake. Thanks to
     Michael Carmack <karmak [] karmak * org> for reporting
     this.
   - Added tests for settings so this doesn't happen again.

0.10  Thu Jun 17 01:35:17 PM 2004
   - Whoops, should always make test before upload..

0.09  Thu Jun 17 01:10:58 PM 2004
   - More fun with the hook to remove config code. It has now
     been made a top level target that works on the code in the
     blib directory. This was needed for systems like Gentoo.

0.09  Thu Jun 17 01:06:09 PM 2004

     include paths and compiler flags.

   - Perl 5.6.1 does not understand a 'const' C function
     for binding with XS. Removed the 'const' definiton from
     clamav_perl_retdbdir(). Thanks to Homer <hparker _at_ homershut.net>
     for reporting this

0.07  Wed Mar 24 02:34:47 PM 2004
