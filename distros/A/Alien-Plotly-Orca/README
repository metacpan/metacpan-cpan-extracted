VERSION

    version 0.0002

SYNOPSIS

        use Alien::Plotly::Orca;
        use Config;
    
        if (Alien::Plotly::Orca->install_type eq 'share') {
            $ENV{PATH} = join(
                $Config{path_sep},
                Alien::Plotly::Orca->bin_dir,
                $ENV{PATH}
            );
    
            # get version
            my $version = Alien::Plotly::Orca->version;
        }
    
        # If install_type is not 'share' then it means plotly-orca
        # was detected from PATH when Alien::Plotly::Orca was installed.
        # So in either case now you should be able to do,
        print `orca -h`;

DESCRIPTION

    This module finds plotly-orca <https://github.com/plotly/orca> from
    your system, or installs it (version 1.3.1).

    For installation it uses prebuilt packages and would supports 3 OS
    platforms: Windows, Linux and OSX. For Windows and OSX it would get
    package from Anaconda's plotly repo
    <https://anaconda.org/plotly/plotly-orca/files>. For Linux it would get
    the AppImage file from plotly-orca's github release page
    <https://github.com/plotly/orca/releases>.

INSTALLATION

 Linux

    Normally you should be all fine if you have a recent version of popular
    distros like Ubuntu as your Linux desktop. If you're an advanced Linux
    user or if you get problems check below list and make sure you have
    them all on you Linux host.

      * FUSE

      to run AppImage, as we use AppImage for Linux. See also
      https://github.com/AppImage/AppImageKit/wiki/FUSE.

      * A running X service

      plotly-orca requires X service. If your host is headless you mostly
      need xvfb <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xvfb>, either ran as a
      service, or ran as a wrapper every time like xvfb-run orca ....

      * "open sans" font

      Not having this font won't cause installation to fail, but texts
      could be not properly rendered in the exported image file. See also
      https://github.com/plotly/orca/issues/148.

 Windows

    On Windows do not have your Perl installation itself in a long path.
    This is because that in the plotly-orca's tar.bz2 archive there are
    some files with quite long paths, and if your Perl itself is in a long
    path, during some intermediate step of installing this library there
    would need very long paths for some extractd files which could exceed
    Windows's default MAX_PATH limit of 260 characters. And Archive::Tar
    cannot handle that properly.

 Mac OSX

    For Mac OSX I can't really test it as I don't have such a system at
    hand. Travis CI does not seem to support Perl for OSX...
