=head1 NAME

EntityModel::Query::Base - base class for L<EntityModel::Query>-derived components

=head1 VERSION

version 0.102

=head1 SYNOPSIS

See L<Entitymodel::Query>.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

See L<Entitymodel::Query>.

=head2 register

Register a parse handler for the given key(s).

Called from subclass ->import methods to hook into the configuration parser:

 EntityModel::Query->new(
 	x => [ ],
	y => [ ]
 )

will call the registered parse_x and parse_y methods to handle the two directives, unless those methods are already available on the class.

=head2 can_parse

If this class supports the parse_X method, or the given configuration key was registered by
one of the subclasses, returns the appropriate parse handler.

Returns undef if no handler was available.

=head2 inlineSQL

=head2 normaliseInlineSQL

Merge adjacent plaintext sections in an inline SQL expression.

This would for example convert the following:

 'select', ' ', Entity::Field, ' ', 'from', ' ', Entity::Table

into:

 'select ', Entity::Field, ' from ', Entity::Table

=head2 decantValue

Extract a value.

=head2 decantQuotedValue

Extract a quoted value suitable for use in direct SQL strings.

The plain-string form of SQL query is only intended for debugging and tracing; regular queries should always use the prepared statement form
provided by L<sqlAndParameters>.
