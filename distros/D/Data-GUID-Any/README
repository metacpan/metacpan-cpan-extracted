NAME
    Data::GUID::Any - Generic interface for GUID/UUID creation

VERSION
    version 0.004

SYNOPSIS
        use Data::GUID::Any 'guid_as_string';

        my $guid = guid_as_string();

DESCRIPTION
    This module is a generic wrapper around various ways of obtaining
    Globally Unique ID's (GUID's), also known as Universally Unique
    Identifiers (UUID's).

    On installation, if Data::GUID::Any can't detect a way of generating
    both version 1 and version 4 GUID's, it will add either Data::UUID::MT
    or UUID::Tiny as a prerequisite, depending on whether or not a compiler
    is available.

    For legacy compatibility with Data::UUID, guid strings are returned
    uppercase, even though RFC 4122 specifies that generators should provide
    lower-case strings. To force lower case results from Data::GUID::Any,
    set $Data::GUID::Any::UC to a false value.

      local $Data::GUID::Any::UC;
      guid_as_string(); # will be lower case

USAGE
    The following functions are available for export.

  guid_as_string()
        my $guid = guid_as_string();

    Returns a guid in string format with upper-case hex characters:

      FA2D5B34-23DB-11DE-B548-0018F34EC37C

    This is the most general subroutine that offers the least amount of
    control over the result. This routine returns whatever is the default
    type of GUID for a source, which could be version 1 or version 4 (or, in
    the case of Win32, something resembling a version 1, but specific to
    Microsoft).

    It will use any of the following sources, listed from most preferred to
    least preferred:

    *   Data::UUID::MT (v4)

    *   Data::GUID (v1)

    *   Data::UUID (v1)

    *   Data::UUID::LibUUID (v4 or v1)

    *   UUID (v4 or v1)

    *   Win32 (using GuidGen()) (similar to v1)

    *   uuid (external program) (v1)

    *   APR::UUID (v4 or v1)

    *   UUID::Tiny (v1)

    At least one of them is guaranteed to exist or Data::GUID::Any will
    throw an exception when loaded. This shouldn't happen if prerequisites
    were correctly installed.

  v1_guid_as_string()
        my $guid = v1_guid_as_string();

    Returns a version 1 (timestamp+MAC/random-identifier) GUID in string
    format with upper-case hex characters from one of the following sources:

    *   Data::UUID::MT

    *   Data::GUID

    *   Data::UUID

    *   Data::UUID::LibUUID

    *   uuid (external program)

    *   UUID::Tiny

    If none of them are available, an exception will be thrown when this is
    called. This shouldn't happen if prerequisites were correctly installed.

  v4_guid_as_string()
        my $guid = v4_guid_as_string();

    Returns a version 4 (random) GUID in string format with upper-case hex
    characters from one of the following modules:

    *   Data::UUID::MT

    *   Data::UUID::LibUUID

    *   uuid (external program)

    *   UUID::Tiny

    If none of them are available, an exception will be thrown when this is
    called. This shouldn't happen if prerequisites were correctly installed.
