=head1 NAME

gtestrunner - GTk+ based frontend to Perl unit testing

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    gtestrunner Tests/MySuite.pm Tests/OtherSuite.pm
    gtestrunner Tests::MySuite Tests::OtherSuite
    gtestrunner

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The program B<gtestrunner> provides a comfortable and intuitive graphical
user interface for running Perl unit tests.

If you don't know what unit tests or test driven development are,
please start reading the documentation for Test::Unit(3pm), or search
the internet for "JUnit" and "test driven development".

The sources for Test-Unit-GTestRunner contain a directory "Suites"
with several dummy testsuites and test cases.  They can serve as
an example for you, and allow you to see B<gtestrunner> in action.  Change
to the source directory and try

    gtestrunner Suites/TS_TopLevel.pm

or 

    gtestrunner Suites::TS_TopLevel

In fact, gtestrunner supports every way of test suite loading, that
the underlying framework Test::Unit(3pm) supports.  If you don't
pass an argument to the script, you can load a test suite from within
the user interface.

The program B<gtestrunner> is actually a script wrapper around
Test::Unit::GTestRunner(3pm).

=head1 GUI OVERVIEW

The graphical user interface to B<gtestrunner> follows the usual
scheme of an application window and shouldn't contain any surprises
to you.

The GUI mainly consists of a drop down menu, a toolbar, a progress
bar, and a tabbed summary window.  The tabbed summary window provides
two different views, a flat lists of failures and a tree view of
all tests, with indicators for success and failure for the individual
test cases.

In either view you can select individual parts of your test suite.
In case of test failures, you will see the corresponding error 
message in the lower window.  You can also click the "Selected"
button next to the "Run" button in the toolbar in order to re-run
the corresponding tests.

=head1 TOOLBAR

The toolbar features five buttons:

=over 4

=item B<Open>

A file selection dialog allows you to load a different test suite.
Please make sure that the selected test suite compiles in the current
working directory.

You can select multiple suites here.

=item B<Run>

Runs the entire test suite.

=item B<Selected>

Read the label as "(Run) Selected".  Run only the currently selected
part of the test suite.  In the failures view, you can only select
individual tests.  In the tree view you can select arbitrary parts
of your test suite.

=item B<Refresh>

Recompiles the entire test suite, so that changes to the structure
get visible in the tree view of the tests.

=item B<Refresh suites before every run>

If checked, the test suite will be recompiled before it is run.  If you
don't recompile a suite, and tests have been removed or added, the
display gets garbled.  You may see error messages associated with
the wrong test.

=item B<Cancel>

Tries to terminate the currently running test suite.

=item B<Quit>

Yes, exactly! No, no confirmation dialog.  I knew you would appreciate
that.

=head1 MENU

The menu bar provides no more functionality than the toolbar.  Please
see the description of the corresponding toolbar buttons.

=head1 INTERNALS

The program is a classical "dumb" frontend.  It has no knowledge 
about unit test suites or their structure.  The test suites passed
as a command-line argument are fed into a subprocess, that loads
these suites, and returns its structure to the parent process.
Loading the test suite blocks, and the frontend does not
repsonsive during this time.

Unless you have unchecked the option "Refresh suite before every
run", this subprocess is also started before any test run, so that
changes in the structure of the test suite are visible in the tree
view of the frontend.  Depending on the complexity of the suite,
that may significantly increase the start up time for the test.

Every test run spawns a new Perl interpreter as another child process.  
The child interpreter is invoked with a -I argument (see perl(1)) for
each member of the @INC array, so that the child process searches
the same directories as the parent process.

You should keep this in mind, when you do changes to your test suites.
It is generally safe to add or remove tests, test cases or test suites
between runs, but only if you reload the suite before every run.

=head1 ENVIRONMENT

If the environment variable "GFC" is set, B<gtestrunner> will use the 
Gtk+ FileChooser dialog instead of the Gtk+ FileSelection dialog.

The package is internationalized with libintl-perl, hence the 
environment variables "LANGUAGE", "LANG", "LC_MESSAGES", and
"LC_ALL" will influence the language in which the GUI and 
messages are presented.
