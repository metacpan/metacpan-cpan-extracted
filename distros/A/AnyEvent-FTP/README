NAME

    AnyEvent::FTP - Simple asynchronous FTP client and server

VERSION

    version 0.18

SYNOPSIS

     # For the client
     use AnyEvent::FTP::Client;
     
     # For the server
     use AnyEvent::FTP::Server;

DESCRIPTION

    This distribution provides client and server implementations for File
    Transfer Protocol (FTP) in an AnyEvent environment. For the specific
    interfaces, see AnyEvent::FTP::Client and AnyEvent::FTP::Server for
    details.

    Before each release, AnyEvent::FTP::Client is tested against these FTP
    servers using the t/client_*.t tests that come with this distribution:

    Proftpd

    wu-ftpd

    Net::FTPServer

    vsftpd

    Pure-FTPd

    bftpd

    AnyEvent::FTP::Server

    The client code is also tested less frequently against these FTP
    servers:

    NcFTPd

    Microsoft IIS

    It used to also be tested against the VMS ftp server, so it was
    verified to work with it, at least at one point. However, I no longer
    have access to that server.

BUNDLED FILES

    This distribution comes bundled with ls from the old Perl Power Tools
    <https://metacpan.org/release/ppt> project. This is only used on
    MSWin32 if this command is not found in the path, as it is frequently
    not available on that platform

    The Perl implementation of ls was written by Mark Leighton Fisher of
    Thomson Consumer Electronics, fisherm@tce.com.

    That program is free and open software. You may use, modify,
    distribute, and sell it program (and any modified variants) in any way
    you wish, provided you do not restrict others from doing the same.
