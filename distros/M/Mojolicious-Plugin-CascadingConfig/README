      # foo.html.ep
      %= $config->{foo} # evaluates to 'bar'
    
      # The configuration is available application-wide
      my $config = app->config;
      say $config->{foo}; # says 'bar'
    
    
      # Mojolicious in development mode
      say $config->{foo}; # says 'not_bar'
      say $config->{baz}; # says '♥'

DESCRIPTION

    Mojolicious::Plugin::CascadingConfig is a Perl-ish configuration plugin
    that loads and merges config files in order, based on
    Mojolicious::Plugin::Config.

    This plugin will load configs in the order specified by "modes" (ending
    with the current app mode if it is not listed in "modes"), with each
    new config adding to the previous config and overwriting any config
    key/value pairs that existed before. Once the config file is read for
    the mode matching mode, the config will be returned. A file must be
    found for each mode specified in "modes".

    Config filenames are expected to be in the form of
    "$moniker.$mode.conf". production is a special mode where the form
    should be "$moniker.conf".

    The application object can be accessed via $app or the app function in
    the config. strict, warnings, utf8 and Perl 5.10 features are
    automatically enabled.

    If the configuration value config_override has been set in "config" in
    Mojolicious when this plugin is loaded, it will not do anything.

OPTIONS

 modes

      # Mojolicious::Lite
    
      # ['production', 'development'] is the default.
      # If staging is the current active mode for the app, the config for staging is not required since
      # it is not explicitly listed in modes.
      plugin CascadingConfig => {modes => ['production', 'development']};
    
    
      # Here a staging config file is required because it is listed in modes.
      plugin CascadingConfig => {modes => ['production', 'development', 'staging']};

    Modes in the order that their config files should be loaded and merged.
    Any config file that is reached for a mode in "modes" must exist. In
    addition to the modes listed, the current app mode will be loaded if a
    config file for it is present once all config files have been loaded
    for each mode in "modes". The config file for the current app mode is
    optional only if it is not in "modes".

    The default is ['production', 'development'].

METHODS

 register

      my $config = $plugin->register($app);
      my $config = $plugin->register($app, {modes => ['prod', 'dev', 'stage', 'qa']});

    Register plugin in Mojolicious application and merge configuration.
