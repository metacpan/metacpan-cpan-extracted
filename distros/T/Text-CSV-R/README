Text-CSV-R version 0.3
======================

This is just a convenient wrapper around Text::CSV. It behaves mostly like R's
read.table and write.table functions. This module has a very simple API and
uses the simplest possible data structure for a table: a reference to a
two-dimensional array. It is very lightweight and has Text::CSV as only
dependency.
