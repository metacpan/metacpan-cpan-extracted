=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module implements simple file rotation.

Files are renamed to have a numeric suffix, e.g. F<backup.tar.gz> is renamed to
F<backup.tar.gz.1>.  Existing file numbers are incremented.

If L</max> is specified, then any files with a larger numeric suffix
are deleted.

If L</age> is specified, then any files older than that number of days
are deleted.

Note that files with the extension C<0> are ignored.

=head1 SEE ALSO

=item * L<File::Rotate::Backup>

=item * L<File::Write::Rotate>

=back

There are also several logging modueles that support log rotation.
