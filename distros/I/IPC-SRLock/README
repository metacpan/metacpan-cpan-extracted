Name

    IPC::SRLock - Set / reset locking semantics to single thread processes

Version

    This documents version v0.31.$Rev: 1 $ of IPC::SRLock

Synopsis

       use IPC::SRLock;
    
       my $config   = { tempdir => 'path_to_tmp_directory', type => 'fcntl' };
    
       my $lock_obj = IPC::SRLock->new( $config );
    
       $lock_obj->set( k => 'some_resource_identfier' );
    
       # This critical region of code is guaranteed to be single threaded
    
       $lock_obj->reset( k => 'some_resource_identfier' );

Description

    Provides set/reset locking methods which will force a critical region
    of code to run single threaded

    Implements a factory pattern, three implementations are provided. The
    LCD option IPC::SRLock::Fcntl which works on non Unixen,
    IPC::SRLock::Sysv which uses System V IPC, and IPC::SRLock::Memcached
    which uses libmemcache to implement a distributed lock manager

Configuration and Environment

    Defines the following attributes;

    type

      Determines which factory subclass is loaded. Defaults to fcntl, can
      be; fcntl, memcached, or sysv

Subroutines/Methods

 BUILDARGS

    Extracts the type attribute from those passed to the factory subclass

 BUILD

    Called after an instance is created this subroutine triggers the lazy
    evaluation of the concrete subclass

 get_table

       my $data = $lock_obj->get_table;

    Returns a hash ref that contains the current lock table contents. The
    keys/values in the hash are suitable for passing to HTML::FormWidgets

 list

       my $array_ref = $lock_obj->list;

    Returns an array of hash refs that represent the current lock table

 reset

       $lock_obj->reset( k => 'some_resource_key' );

    Resets the lock referenced by the k attribute.

 set

       $lock_obj->set( k => 'some_resource_key' );

    Sets the specified lock. Attributes are:

    k

      Unique key to identify the lock. Mandatory no default

    p

      Explicitly set the process id associated with the lock. Defaults to
      the current process id

    t

      Set the time to live for this lock. Defaults to five minutes. Setting
      it to zero makes the lock last indefinitely

Diagnostics

    Setting debug to true will cause the set methods to log the lock record
    at the debug level

Dependencies

    File::DataClass

    Moo

    Type::Tiny

Incompatibilities

    The sysv subclass type will not work on MSWin32 and cygwin platforms

Bugs and Limitations

    Testing of the memcached subclass type is skipped on all platforms as
    it requires memcached to be listening on the localhost's default
    memcached port localhost:11211

    There are no known bugs in this module. Please report problems to the
    address below. Patches are welcome
