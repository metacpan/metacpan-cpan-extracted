=head1 DESCRIPTION

Catalyst::View::GD::Thumbnail resizes images to produce thumbnails, with options to set the desired x or y
dimensions. Uses the GD image library for those who are already using something more advanced than Imager.

=head2 Options

The view is controlled by setting the following values in the stash:

=over

=item image

Contains the file path for the full-size source image.

This is a mandatory option.

=item x

The width (in pixels) of the thumbnail.

This is optional, but at least one of the C<x> or C<y> parameters must be set.

=item y

The height (in pixels) of the thumbnail.

This is optional, but at least one of the C<x> or C<y> parameters must be set.

=back

=head2 Image formats

The generated thumbnails will always be produced in the same format (PNG, JPG, etc)
as the source image.

Catalyst::View::GD::Thumbnail uses the L<Image::Resize> module to crop and resize images,
so it accept any image format supported by I<Image::Resize>: bmp, gif, jpeg, png, xbm, xpm.

Please see the L<Image::Resize> documentation for more details and installation notes.
