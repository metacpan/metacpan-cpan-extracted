       "brn" renames the filenames supplied according to the rule(s) given by
       the --expr (-e) option(s). If no such option is present then the first
       argument is taken to be the rule. The _p_e_r_l_e_x_p_r argument is a Perl
       expression which is expected to modify the $_ string in Perl for at
       least some of the filenames specified. If a given filename is not
       modified by the expression, it will not be renamed. If no filenames are
       given on the command line, filenames will be read via standard input.

       For example, to rename all files matching "*.bak" to strip the
       extension, you might say

               brn 's/\.bak$//' *.bak

       To translate uppercase names to lower, you'd use

               brn 'y/A-Z/a-z/' *

       brn loads all Modules into a _USER package, and this is also where all
       expresions are evaluated. Note that the _USER package doesn't have
       'strict' turned on, so variables do not need to be pre-declared. There
       are also a few predefined helper functions in its scope, to ease common
       rename tasks.

       In void context, all of these helper functions output as if in scalar
       context by modifing their first parameter or $_ (if their parameter is
       unmodifiable). They will use $_ for their input data if called without.
       Thus, one can now uppercase all files in a directory just by saying

               brn 'uc' *

       This can also be used in expression interpolation inside larger
       strings, so as to achieve more complex results. The command:

               brn 's/Show-(.*?).avi/Show - @{[ hc(spc($1)) ]}.avi/' *

       Will extract a substring, perform space replacement, convert to
       highlight case, and re-insert the substring back into the name.

       The full set of helper functions are:

       sslluurrpp       slurp reads in an entire file given a filename or
                   filehandle. In array context it returns individual chomped
                   lines, while in scalar context it returns the entire file.

       rrdd          rd reads entire directories and is the equivalent of slurp.
                   In array context it returns an array containing all the
                   entries in all the directories passed to it. In scalar
                   context it returns all the directory names in a single
                   string, separated by newlines.

       ssppcc(($$;;$$))    by default _s_p_c_(_) takes a string and returns it with all
                   dots ('.') and underscores ('_') converted to spaces. An
                   optional second argument can provide a string of characters
                   that overrides the list of characters to convert to spaces.

       sscc(($$))       _s_c_(_) returns its input string converted to 'Sentence' case,
                   meaning that the letter of each embedded sentence will be
                   capitalized.

       ttcc(($$))       _t_c_(_) returns its input string converted to 'Title' case,
                   meaning that the first letter of each word is uppercased.

       hhcc(($$))       _h_c_(_) returns its input string converted to 'Highlight'
                   case, meaning that the first letter of each non-trivial
                   word is uppercased.

               Verbose: increases the verbosity of brn. This option can appear
               multiple times, and each appearance increases brn's verbosity
               level by one. The option ----qquuiieett can be used to decrease
               verbosity.  The following table lists the information presented
               at different verbosity levels. The default verbosity is 1.

               Quiet: decreases the verbosity level of brn by 1. See ----vveerrbboossee
               for a discussion of verbosity levels.

       --nn, ----nnoopp
               No Operation (NOP): show what files would have been renamed.

       --ff, ----ffoorrccee
               Force: overwrite existing files.

       --DD, ----ddeebbuugg
               Debug: Turn on internal debugging shims. Intended for
               developers only.

       --ee, ----eexxpprr
               Expression: this option holds a rename expression to be used to
               rename files. Multiple instances of this flag may appear on the
               command line, and they are executed in order, for each file
               specified.

               If no occurance of this flag appears on the command line, then
               the first argument will be taken as a rename expression and
               subsequent arguments will be taken as file names.

               If this flag does appear on the command line, then all
               arguments are assumed to be file names.

       --MM _m_o_d_u_l_e_[_=_f_o_o_,_b_a_r_]
               Load the listed modules at the start of the program. If the
               optional extra parameters are added, then they will be used to
               import the listed functions. Multiple instances can appear on
               the command line, and they will be loaded in the order given.

       --pp _p_e_r_l_e_x_p_r, ----pprreeaammbbllee=_p_e_r_l_e_x_p_r
               Preamble: execute the expression once, before looping over the
               files to rename, this can be useful to load data files or do
               other setup before complex rename procedures. Multiple
               preambles can be given, and they will be executed in order.

       --uu | ----uussee _p_r_e_s_e_t
               Use preset: Rather than specifying a complex operation on the
               command line, you can also save a set of command line options
               in a config file, and use them by using the 'use' option. By
               default the config file is stored in _$_{_H_O_M_E_}_/_._c_o_n_f_i_g_/_r_n_._c_o_n_f
               but this can be changed with the ----ccoonnffiigg (--cc) command.
               Multiple use options can be specified, and their operations
               will be executed in turn.

       --SS | ----ssaavvee _p_r_e_s_e_t
               Save preset: Rather than executing the contents of the current
               command line, the options will be stored in the rn config file
               under the given preset name.

       --LL | ----lliisstt _p_r_e_s_e_t
               List preset: Rather than performing a rename operation, just
               list the command line options stored under the given preset
               name. Multiple ----lliisstt options can be given, to see multiple
               presets.

       --CC | ----ccoonnffiigg _c_o_n_f_i_g_p_a_t_h
               Normally, all stored presets are assumed to be in the default
               location, which is _$_{_H_O_M_E_}_/_._c_o_n_f_i_g_/_r_n_._c_o_n_f, but this can be
               changed on a preset-by-preset basis with the ----ccoonnffiigg option,
               which allows you to specify the full pathname of another config
               file.

               If a preset itself references other presets then they will be
               looked up either in the last specified config file, which will
               be the one specified in that preset (if any).

       brn returns an exit code indicating the success or failure of the
       requested operation. 0 always indicates a success. A return code less
       than 16 indicates success in an auxiliary function of brn (such as
       successfully return its version.) Starting at 16, the error codes
       indicate various fatal errors.

       There are probably innumerable bugs in this code as it is still in
       alpha state. Among the known problems are the possibly incorrect
       chaining of -u options, and the failure to always maintain the order of
       mixed -e and -u options.

       In addition there are many stubs for features that do not yet work
       fully (if at all) and the documentation is slightly behind the work.

HHIISSTTOORRYY
       The original "rename" did not check for the existence of target
       filenames, so had to be used with care.  I hope I've fixed that (Robin
       Barker).

       The original "rename" seemed to me to be lacking a number of useful
       features, and as its last update had been back in 1998, I (Stirling
       Westrup) decided to fork a version to work on.
