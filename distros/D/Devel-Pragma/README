Devel::Pragma version 1.1.0
================================

This module provides helper functions for developers of lexical pragmas, though a few functions may
be useful to non-pragma developers as well.

Pragmas can be used both in older versions of perl (from 5.8.1), which had limited support, and in
the most recent versions, which have improved support.
