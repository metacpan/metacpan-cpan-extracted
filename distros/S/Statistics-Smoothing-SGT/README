NAME
    README for SGT package

    Last updated for version 2.10, 12 January 2007

SYNOPSIS
    This document provides a general introduction to the SGT
    (Simple Good Turing smoothing) package.

DESCRIPTION

	This Perl module implements the Simple Good Turing (SGT) algorithm 
    for smoothing of probabilistic values developed by William Gale and 
    Geoffrey Sampson.

    The algorithm is described in detail in Sampson's Empirical Linguistics
    (Continuum International, London and New York, 2001), chapter 7.
    An online version of this paper is available at Geoffrey Sampson's
    homepage under http://www.grsampson.net/AGtf.html .
    
    Basic usage:

	    use Statistics::Smoothing::SGT
		my $sgt = new Statistics::Smoothing::SGT($frequencyClasses, $total);
		$sgt->calculateValues();
  		$probabilities = $sgt->getProbabilities();
  		$newFrequencies = $sgt->getNewFrequencies();
  		$nBar = $sgt->getNBar();
