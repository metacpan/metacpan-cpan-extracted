<h2>Using non-standard encoding</h2>
Kostas Chatzikokolakis submitted a patch with the following explanation:
<br>
All data in flash remoting are sent as unicode. However, database data
and scripts are usually in a local encoding. I made some enhacements to
AMF::Perl so that it automatically converts all strings to utf8 when sending
and back to the given encoding when receiving. The usage is:
<pre>
my $gateway = new AMF::Perl;
$gateway->encoding("iso-8859-7");
$gateway->setBaseClassPath("Services/");
$gateway->service();
</pre>

<a href=index.html>Go back to the AMF::Perl documentation</a>
