  Cache::Bounded - A size-aware in-memory cache optimized for speed - 1.09

================================================================================
SYNOPSIS:
================================================================================

    Cache::Bounded is designed for caching items into memory in a very fast
    but rudimentarily size-aware fashion.

================================================================================
INSTALLATION:
================================================================================

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

================================================================================
DESCRIPTION:
================================================================================

    Most intelligent caches take either a size-aware or use-aware approach.
    They do so by either anlysing the size of all the elements in the cache
    or their frequency of usage before determining which elements to drop
    from the cache. Unfortunately, the processing overhead for this logic
    (usually applied on insert) will often slow these caches singnificantly
    when frequent insertions are needed.

    This module was designed address when this speed-penalty becomes a
    problem. Specifically, it is a rudimentarily size-aware cache that is
    optimized to be very fast.

    For its size analysis, this module merely checks the number of elements
    in the cache against a raw size limit. (The default limit is 500,000)
    Additionally, to aid speed, the "size" check doesn't occur on every
    insertion. Only after a count of a certain number of insertions (default
    1,000) is the size check performed. If the size limit has been exceeded,
    the entire cache is purged. (Since there is no usage analysis, there is
    no other logical depreciation that can be applied)

    This produces a very fast in-memory cache that you can tune to
    approximate size based upon your data elements.
