=head2 Paint (Win32::GUI::Window)

B<Paint(DC)>

Sent when the window needs to be repainted.

Note that you get the DC of the window object in parameter,
and then Validate() the DC to inform Windows
that you painted the DC area (otherwise it will
continue to call the Paint event continuously).
Example:

  sub Graphic_Paint {
      my $DC = shift;
      $DC->MoveTo(0, 0);
      $DC->LineTo(100, 100);
      $DC->Validate();
  }
