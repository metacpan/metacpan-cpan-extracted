  Changes from version 0.21 to 0.23
    1. added an --intrinsic [santos|sanchez] option to use the information
    content measures with the intrinisic information content metrics
    proposed by Santos, et al 2004 and Sanchez, et al 2011. This is
    currently only available in the umls-targetword-senserelate.pl program
    but I will be adding it to the allwords once I get it sped up a bit.

  Changes from version 0.13 to 0.15

    measures
