SMS::Ringtone::RTTTL::Parser
============================

Description
-----------

SMS::Ringtone::RTTTL::Parser is a pure Perl RTTTL string parser and validator.
See http://members.tripod.lycos.nl/jupp/linux/soft/rtttl_player/EBNF.txt for
RTTTL syntax in BNF.
I've included a HTML version of the POD docs in the html subdirectory.
