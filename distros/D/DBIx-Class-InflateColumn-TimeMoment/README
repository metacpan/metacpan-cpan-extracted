NAME

    DBIx::Class::InflateColumn::TimeMoment - Auto-create TimeMoment objects
    from date and datetime columns.

VERSION

    version 0.050

SYNOPSIS

    Load this component and then declare one or more columns to be of the
    datetime, timestamp or date datatype.

      package Event;
      use base 'DBIx::Class::Core';
    
      __PACKAGE__->load_components(qw/InflateColumn::TimeMoment/);
      __PACKAGE__->add_columns(
        starts_when => { data_type => 'datetime' }
        create_date => { data_type => 'date' }
      );

    Then you can treat the specified column as a TimeMoment object.

    If you want to inflate no matter what data_type your column is, use
    inflate_datetime or inflate_date:

      __PACKAGE__->add_columns(
        starts_when => { data_type => 'varchar', inflate_datetime => 1 }
      );
    
      __PACKAGE__->add_columns(
        starts_when => { data_type => 'varchar', inflate_date => 1 }
      );

    It's also possible to explicitly skip inflation:

      __PACKAGE__->add_columns(
        starts_when => { data_type => 'datetime', inflate_datetime => 0 }
      );

DESCRIPTION

    This module works with Time::Moment IS8601 date formats to
    inflate/deflate. A later version may handle databases in a more
    forgiving way, but really why not make them do something sensible.

    For more help with using components, see "USING" in
    DBIx::Class::Manual::Component.

 register_column

    Chains with the "register_column" in DBIx::Class::Row method, and sets
    up datetime columns appropriately. This would not normally be directly
    called by end users.

    In the case of an invalid date, Time::Moment will throw an exception.
    To bypass these exceptions and just have the inflation return undef,
    use the datetime_undef_if_invalid option in the column info:

        "broken_date",
        {
            data_type => "datetime",
            default_value => '0000-00-00',
            is_nullable => 1,
            datetime_undef_if_invalid => 1
        }

    NOTE: Don't rely on InflateColumn::TimeMoment to parse date strings for
    you. The column is set directly for any non-references and
    InflateColumn::TimeMoment is completely bypassed. Instead, use an input
    parser to create a TimeMoment object.

HISTORY

    As is obvious from a quick inspection of the code, this module is very
    heavily based on and draws code from
    DBIx::Class::InflateColumn::DateTime, however it is significantly
    simplified due to the less well developed timezone handling and
    formatter ecosystem.

SEE ALSO

    More information about the add_columns method, and column metadata, can
    be found in the documentation for DBIx::Class::ResultSource.
