  Attributes
    Attributes accessed in "DBIx::Wrapper" object via hash access are passed
    on or retrieved from the underlying DBI object, e.g.,

     $dbi_obj->{RaiseError} = 1

  Named Placeholders
    All native* methods (except for "nativeSelectExecLoop()") support named
    placeholders. That is, instead of using ? as a placeholder, you can use
    :name, where name is the name of a key in the hash passed to the method.
    To use named placeholders, pass a hash reference containing the values
    in place of the @exec_args argument. E.g.,

     my $row = $db->nativeSelect("SELECT * FROM test_table WHERE id=:id", { id => 1 });

    :: in the query string gets converted to : so you can include literal
    colons in the query. :"var name" and :'var name' are also supported so
    you can use variable names containing spaces.

    The implementation uses ? as placeholders under the hood so that quoting
    is done properly. So if your database driver does not support
    placeholders, named placeholders will not help you.

DESCRIPTION
    "DBIx::Wrapper" provides a wrapper around the DBI that makes it a bit
    easier on the programmer. This module allows you to execute a query with
    a single method call as well as make inserts easier, etc. It also
    supports running hooks at various stages of processing a query (see the
    section on "Hooks").

METHODS
    Following are "DBIx::Wrapper" methods. Any undocumented methods should
    be considered private.

  "connect($data_source, $username, $auth, \%attr, \%params)"
    Connects to the given database. The first four parameters are the same
    parameters you would pass to the connect call when using DBI directly.
    If $data_source is a hash, it will generate the dsn for DBI using the
    values for the keys driver, database, host, port.

    The %params hash is optional and contains extra parameters to control
    the behaviour of "DBIx::Wrapper" itself. Following are the valid
    parameters.

    error_handler and debug_handler
        These values should either be a reference to a subroutine, or a
        reference to an array whose first element is an object and whose
        second element is a method name to call on that object. The
        parameters passed to the error_handler callback are the current
        "DBIx::Wrapper" object and an error string, usually the query if
        appropriate. The parameters passed to the debug_handler callback are
        the current "DBIx::Wrapper" object, an error string, and the
        filehandle passed to the "debugOn()" method (defaults to "STDERR").
        E.g.,

          sub do_error {
              my ($db, $str) = @_;
              print $DBI::errstr;
          }
          sub do_debug {
              my ($db, $str, $fh) = @_;
              print $fh "query was: $str\n";
          }
         
  my $db = DBIx::Wrapper->connect($ds, $un, $auth, \%attr,
                                          { error_handler => \&do_error,
                                            debug_handler => \&do_debug,
                                          });

    db_style
        Used to control some database specific logic. The default value is
        'mysql'. Currently, this is only used for the "getLastInsertId()"
        method. MSSQL is supported with a value of mssql for this parameter.

    heavy
        If set to a true value, any hashes returned will actually be objects
        on which you can call methods to get the values back. E.g.,

          my $row = $db->nativeSelect($query);
          my $id = $row->id;
          # or
          my $id = $row->{id};

    no_placeholders
        If you are unfortunate enough to be using a database that does not
        support placeholders, you can set no_placeholders to a true value
        here. For non native* methods that generate SQL on their own,
        placeholders are normally used to ensure proper quoting of values.
        If you set no_placeholders to a true value, DBI's "quote()" method
        will be used to quote the values instead of using placeholders.

  "new($data_source, $username, $auth, \%attr, \%params)"
     An alias for connect().

  "connect_from_config($db_key, $config_file, \%params)"
    Like "connect()", but the parameters used to connect are taken from the
    given configuration file. The Config::General module must be present for
    this method to work (it is loaded as needed). $config_file should be the
    path to a configuration file in an Apache-style format. $db_key is the
    name of the container with the database connection information you wish
    to use. The %params hash is optional and contains extra parameters to
    control the behaviour of "DBIx::Wrapper" itself.

    Following is an example configuration file. Note that the dsn can be
    specified either as a container with each piece named separately, or as
    an option whose value is the full dsn that should be based to the
    underlying DBI object. Each db container specifies one database
    connection. Note that, unlike Apache, the containers and option names
    are case-sensitive.

        <db test_db_key>
            <dsn>
                driver mysql
                database test_db
                host example.com
                port 3306
            </dsn>
     
        user test_user
            password test_pwd
     
        <attributes>
                RaiseError 0
                PrintError 1
            </attributes>
        </db>
     
    <db test_db_key2>
            dsn "dbi:mysql:database=test_db;host=example.com;port=3306"
     
        user test_user
            password test_pwd
        </db>

    Configuration features from Config::General supported:

    *   Perl style comments

    *   C-style comments

    *   Here-documents

    *   Apache style Include directive

    *   Variable interpolation (see docs for Config::General::Interpolated)

  "reconnect()"
    Reconnect to the database using the same parameters that were given to
    the "connect()" method. It does not try to disconnect before attempting
    to connect again.

  "disconnect()"
    Disconnect from the database. This disconnects and frees up the
    underlying "DBI" object.

  "connectOne(\@cfg_list, \%attr)"
    Connects to a random database out of the list. This is useful for
    connecting to a slave database out of a group for read-only access. Ths
    list should look similar to the following:

        my $cfg_list = [ { driver => 'mysql',
                           host => 'db0.example.com',
                           port => 3306,
                           database => 'MyDB',
                           user => 'dbuser',
                           auth => 'dbpwd',
                           attr => { RaiseError => 1 },
                           weight => 1,
                         },
                         { driver => 'mysql',
                           host => 'db1.example.com',
                           port => 3306,
                           database => 'MyDB',
                           user => 'dbuser',
                           auth => 'dbpwd',
                           attr => { RaiseError => 1 },
                           weight => 2,
                         },
                       ];

    where the weight fields are optional (defaulting to 1). The attr field
    is also optional and corresponds to the 4th argument to DBI's
    "connect()" method. The "\%attr" passed to this method is an optional
    parameter specifying the defaults for "\%attr" to be passed to the
    "connect()" method. The attr field in the config for each database in
    the list overrides any in the "\%attr" parameter passed into the method.

    You may also pass the DSN string for the connect() method as the 'dsn'
    field in each config instead of the separate driver, host, port, and
    database fields, e.g.,

        my $cfg_list = [ { dsn => 'dbi:mysql:host=db0.example.com;database=MyDB;port=3306',
                           user => 'dbuser',
                           auth => 'dbpwd',
                           attr => { RaiseError => 1 },
                           weight => 1,
                         },
                       ];

    Aliases: connect_one

  "newFromDBI($dbh)"
    Returns a new DBIx::Wrapper object from a DBI object that has already
    been created. Note that when created this way, disconnect() will not be
    called automatically on the underlying DBI object when the DBIx::Wrapper
    object goes out of scope.

    Aliases: new_from_dbi

  "getDBI()"
    Return the underlying DBI object used to query the database.

    Aliases: get_dbi, getDbi

  "insert($table, \%data)"
    Insert the provided row into the database. $table is the name of the
    table you want to insert into. %data is the data you want to insert -- a
    hash with key/value pairs representing a row to be insert into the
    database.

  "replace($table, \%data)"
    Same as "insert()", except does a "REPLACE" instead of an "INSERT" for
    databases which support it.

  "smartReplace($table, \%data)"
    This method is MySQL specific. If $table has an auto_increment column,
    the return value will be the value of the auto_increment column. So if
    that column was specified in "\%data", that value will be returned,
    otherwise, an insert will be performed and the value of
    "LAST_INSERT_ID()" will be returned. If there is no auto_increment
    column, but primary keys are provided, the row containing the primary
    keys will be returned. Otherwise, a true value will be returned upon
    success.

    Aliases: smart_replace

  "delete($table, \%keys), delete($table, \@keys)"
    Delete rows from table $table using the key/value pairs in %keys to
    specify the "WHERE" clause of the query. Multiple key/value pairs are
    joined with "AND" in the "WHERE" clause. The "cols" parameter can
    optionally be an array ref instead of a hashref. E.g.

         $db->delete($table, [ key1 => $val1, key2 => $val2 ])

    This is so that the order of the parameters in the "WHERE" clause are
    kept in the same order. This is required to use the correct multi field
    indexes in some databases.

  "update($table, \%keys, \%data), update($table, \@keys, \%data)"
    Update the table using the key/value pairs in %keys to specify the
    "WHERE" clause of the query. %data contains the new values for the
    row(s) in the database. The keys parameter can optionally be an array
    ref instead of a hashref. E.g.,

         $db->update($table, [ key1 => $val1, key2 => $val2 ], \%data);

    This is so that the order of the parameters in the "WHERE" clause are
    kept in the same order. This is required to use the correct multi field
    indexes in some databases.

  "exists($table, \%keys)"
    Returns true if one or more records exist with the given column values
    in %keys. %keys can be recursive as in the "selectFromHash()" method.

  "selectFromHash($table, \%keys, \@cols);"
    Select from table $table using the key/value pairs in %keys to specify
    the "WHERE" clause of the query. Multiple key/value pairs are joined
    with "AND" in the "WHERE" clause. Returns a single row as a hashref. If
    %keys is empty or not passed, it is treated as "SELECT * FROM $table"
    with no "WHERE" clause. @cols is a list of columns you want back. If
    nothing is passed in @cols, all columns will be returned.

    If a value in the %keys hash is an array ref, the resulting query will
    search for records with any of those values. E.g.,

       my $row = $db->selectFromHash('the_table', { id => [ 5, 6, 7 ] });

    will result in a query like

       SELECT * FROM the_table WHERE (id=5 OR id=6 OR id=7)

    The call

       my $row = $db->selectFromHash('the_table', { id => [ 5, 6, 7 ], the_val => 'ten' });

    will result in a query like

       SELECT * FROM the_table WHERE (id=5 OR id=6 OR id=7) AND the_val="ten"

    or, if a value was passed in for "\@cols", e.g.,

       my $row = $db->selectFromHash('the_table', { id => [ 5, 6, 7 ], the_val => 'ten' }, [ 'id' ]);

    the resulting query would be

       SELECT id FROM the_table WHERE (id=5 OR id=6 OR id=7) AND the_val="ten"

    Aliases: select_from_hash, sfh

  "selectFromHashMulti($table, \%keys, \@cols)"
    Like "selectFromHash()", but returns all rows in the result. Returns a
    reference to an array of hashrefs.

    Aliases: select_from_hash_multi, sfhm

  "selectAll($table, \@cols)"
    Selects every row in the given table. Equivalent to leaving out %keys
    when calling "selectFromHashMulti()", e.g.,
    "$dbh->selectFromHashMulti($table, undef, \@cols)". The simplest case of
    "$dbh->selectAll($table)" gets turned into something like "SELECT * FROM
    '$table'"

    Aliases: select_from_all

  "selectValueFromHash($table, \%keys, $col)"
    Combination of "nativeSelectValue()" and "selectFromHash()". Returns the
    first column from the result of a query given by $table and %keys, as in
    "selectFromHash()". $col is the column to return.

    Aliases: select_value_from_hash, svfh

  "selectValueFromHashMulti($table, \%keys, \@cols)"
    Like "selectValueFromHash()", but returns the first column of all rows
    in the result.

    Aliases: select_value_from_hash_multi, svfhm

  "smartUpdate($table, \%keys, \%data)"
    Same as "update()", except that a check is first made to see if there
    are any rows matching the data in %keys. If so, "update()" is called,
    otherwise, "insert()" is called.

    Aliases: smart_update

  "nativeSelect($query, \@exec_args)"
    Executes the query in $query and returns a single row result (as a hash
    ref). If there are multiple rows in the result, the rest get silently
    dropped. @exec_args are the same arguments you would pass to an
    "execute()" called on a DBI object. Returns undef on error.

    Aliases: native_select

  "nativeSelectExecLoop($query)"
    Like "nativeSelect()", but returns a loop object that can be used to
    execute the same query over and over with different bind parameters.
    This does a single DBI "prepare()" instead of a new "prepare()" for
    select.

    E.g.,

         my $loop = $db->nativeSelectExecLoop("SELECT * FROM mytable WHERE id=?");
         foreach my $id (@ids) {
             my $row = $loop->next([ $id ]);
         }

    To get the column names in the order returned from your query:

     # returns the names with their character case the same as when
     # calling $loop->next, i.e., the case set with $db->setNameArg
     my $cols = $loop->get_field_names;
     
 # returns the names with their character case unmodified
     my $cols = $loop->get_names;
     
 # returns the names in all upper-case
     my $cols = $loop->get_names_uc;
     
 # returns the names in all lower-case
     my $cols = $loop->get_names_lc;

    Aliases: native_select_exec_loop

  "nativeSelectWithArrayRef($query, \@exec_args)"
    Like "nativeSelect()", but return a reference to an array instead of a
    hash. Returns undef on error. If there are no results from the query, a
    reference to an empty array is returned.

    Aliases: native_select_with_array_ref, nswar

  "nativeSelectMulti($query, \@exec_args)"
    Executes the query in $query and returns an array of rows, where each
    row is a hash representing a row of the result. Returns "undef" on
    error. If there are no results for the query, an empty array ref is
    returned.

    Aliases: native_select_multi

  "nativeSelectMultiOrOne($query, \@exec_args)"
    Like "nativeSelectMulti()", but if there is only one row in the result,
    that row (a hash ref) is returned. If there are zero rows, undef is
    returned. Otherwise, an array ref is returned.

    Aliases: native_select_multi_or_one

  "nativeSelectMultiExecLoop($query)"
    Like "nativeSelectExecLoop()", but returns an array of rows, where each
    row is a hash representing a row of the result.

    Aliases: native_select_multi_exec_loop

  "nativeSelectMultiWithArrayRef($query, \@exec_args)"
    Like "nativeSelectMulti()", but return a reference to an array of arrays
    instead of to an array of hashes. Returns undef on error.

    Aliases: native_select_multi_with_array_ref

  "nativeSelectMapping($query, \@exec_args)"
    Executes the given query and returns a reference to a hash containing
    the first and second columns of the results as key/value pairs.

    Aliases: native_select_mapping, nsm

  "nativeSelectDynaMapping($query, \@cols, \@exec_args)"
    Similar to "nativeSelectMapping()" except you specify which columns to
    use for the key/value pairs in the return hash. If the first element of
    @cols starts with a digit, then @cols is assumed to contain indexes for
    the two columns you wish to use. Otherwise, @cols is assumed to contain
    the field names for the two columns you wish to use.

    For example,

         nativeSelectMapping($query, \@exec_args) is

    equivalent (and in fact calls) to

         nativeSelectDynaMapping($query, [ 0, 1 ], $exec_args).

    Aliases: native_select_dyna_mapping, nsdm

  "nativeSelectRecordMapping($query, \@exec_args)"
    Similar to "nativeSelectMapping()", except the values in the hash are
    references to the corresponding record (as a hash).

    Aliases: native_select_record_mapping

  "nativeSelectRecordDynaMapping($query, $col, \@exec_args)"
    Similar to "nativeSelectRecordMapping()", except you specify which
    column is the key in each key/value pair in the hash. If $col starts
    with a digit, then it is assumed to contain the index for the column you
    wish to use. Otherwise, $col is assumed to contain the field name for
    the two columns you wish to use.

  "nativeSelectValue($query, \@exec_args)"
    Returns a single value, the first column from the first row of the
    result. Returns undef on error or if there are no rows in the result.
    Note this may be the same value returned for a "NULL" value in the
    result.

    Aliases: native_select_value

  "nativeSelectValuesArray($query, \@exec_args)"
    Like "nativeSelectValue()", but return multiple values, e.g., return an
    array of ids for the query

     SELECT id FROM WHERE color_pref='red'

    Aliases: native_select_values_array

  "abstractSelect($table, \@fields, \%where, \@order)"
    Same as "nativeSelect()" except uses SQL::Abstract to generate the SQL.
    See the POD for SQL::Abstract for usage. You must have SQL::Abstract
    installed for this method to work.

    Aliases: abstract_select

  "abstractSelectMulti($table, \@fields, \%where, \@order)"
    Same as "nativeSelectMulti()" except uses SQL::Abstract to generate the
    SQL. See the POD for SQL::Abstract for usage. You must have
    SQL::Abstract installed for this method to work.

    Aliases: abstract_select_multi

  "nativeSelectLoop($query, @exec_args)"
    Executes the query in $query, then returns an object that allows you to
    loop through one result at a time, e.g.,

        my $loop = $db->nativeSelectLoop("SELECT * FROM my_table");
        while (my $row = $loop->next) {
            my $id = $$row{id};
        }

    To get the number of rows selected, you can call the "rowCountCurrent()"
    method on the loop object, e.g.,

        my $loop = $db->nativeSelectLoop("SELECT * FROM my_table");
        my $rows_in_result = $loop->rowCountCurrent;

    The "count()" method is an alias for "rowCountCurrent()".

    To get the number of rows returned by "next()" so far, use the
    "rowCountTotal()" method.

    To get the column names in the order returned from your query:

     # returns the names with their character case the same as when
     # calling $loop->next, i.e., the case set with $db->setNameArg
     my $cols = $loop->get_field_names;
     
 # returns the names with their character case unmodified
     my $cols = $loop->get_names;
     
 # returns the names in all upper-case
     my $cols = $loop->get_names_uc;
     
 # returns the names in all lower-case
     my $cols = $loop->get_names_lc;

    Aliases: native_select_loop

  "nativeQuery($query, \@exec_args, \%attr)"
    Executes the query in $query and returns true if successful. This is
    typically used for deletes and is a catchall for anything the methods
    provided by this module don't take into account.

    Aliases: native_query

  "nativeQueryLoop($query)"
    A loop on nativeQuery, where any placeholders you have put in your query
    are bound each time you call "next()". E.g.,

        my $loop = $db->nativeQueryLoop("UPDATE my_table SET value=? WHERE id=?");
        $loop->next([ 'one', 1]);
        $loop->next([ 'two', 2]);

    Aliases: native_query_loop

  "command($cmd_string)"
    This creates a literal SQL command for use in "insert()", "update()",
    and related methods, since if you simply put something like "CUR_DATE()"
    as a value in the %data parameter passed to insert, the function will
    get quoted, and so will not work as expected. Instead, do something like
    this:

        my $data = { file => 'my_document.txt',
                     the_date => $db->command('CUR_DATE()')
                   };
        $db->insert('my_doc_table', $data);

    This can also be done by passing a reference to a string with the SQL
    command, e.g.,

        my $data = { file => 'my_document.txt',
                     the_date => \'CUR_DATE()'
                   };
        $db->insert('my_doc_table', $data);

    This is currently how "command()" is implemented.

  "debugOn(\*FILE_HANDLE)"
    Turns on debugging output. Debugging information will be printed to the
    given filehandle.

  "debugOff()"
    Turns off debugging output.

  "setNameArg($arg)"
    This is the argument to pass to the "fetchrow_hashref()" call on the
    underlying DBI object. By default, this is 'NAME_lc', so that all field
    names returned are all lowercase to provide for portable code. If you
    want to make all the field names return be uppercase, call
    "$db->setNameArg('NAME_uc')" after the "connect()" call. And if you
    really want the case of the field names to be what the underlying
    database driver returns them as, call "$db->setNameArg('NAME')".

    Aliases: set_name_arg

  "err()"
    Calls "err()" on the underlying DBI object, which returns the native
    database engine error code from the last driver method called.

  "errstr()"
    Calls "errstr()" on the underlying DBI object, which returns the native
    database engine error message from the last driver method called.

  DBI-compatible methods
    The following method calls use the same interface as the DBI method.
    However, these are not simply passed through to DBI (see DBI methods
    below), so any hooks you have defined for "DBIx::Wrapper" will be
    called.

    "do"

  DBI methods
    The following method calls are just passed through to the underlying DBI
    object for convenience. See the documentation for DBI for details.

    "prepare"
        This method may call hooks in the future. Use "prepare_no_hooks()"
        if you want to ensure that it will be a simple DBI call.

    "selectrow_arrayref"

    "selectrow_hashref"

    "selectall_arrayref"

    "selectall_hashref"

    "selectcol_arrayref"

    "quote"

    "commit"

    "begin_work"

    "rollback"

    "ping"

  "getLastInsertId()", "get_last_insert_id()", "last_insert_id()"
    Returns the last_insert_id. The default is to be MySQL specific. It just
    runs the query "SELECT LAST_INSERT_ID()". However, it will also work
    with MSSQL with the right parameters (see the db_style parameter in the
    section explaining the "connect()" method).

  Hooks
    "DBIx::Wrapper" supports hooks that get called just before and just
    after various query operations. The add*Hook methods take a single
    argument that is either a code reference (e.g., anonymous subroutine
    reference), or an array whose first element is an object and whose
    second element is the name of a method to call on that object.

    The hooks will be called with a request object as the first argument.
    See DBIx::Wrapper::Request.

    The two expected return values are "$request->OK" and
    "$request->DECLINED". The first tells "DBIx::Wrapper" that the current
    hook has done everything that needs to be done and doesn't call any
    other hooks in the stack for the current request. "DECLINED" tells
    "DBIx::Wrapper" to continue down the hook stack as if the current
    handler was never invoked.

    See DBIx::Wrapper::Request for example hooks.

   "addPrePrepareHook($hook)"
    Specifies a hook to be called just before any SQL statement is
    prepare()'d.

   "addPostPrepareHook($hook)"
    Specifies a hook to be called just after any SQL statement is
    prepare()'d.

   "addPreExecHook($hook)"
    Specifies a hook to be called just before any SQL statement is
    execute()'d.

   "addPostExecHook($hook)"
    Adds a hook to be called just after a statement is execute()'d.

   "addPreFetchHook($hook)"
    Adds a hook to be called just before data is fetch()'d from the server.

   "addPostFetchHook($hook)"
    Adds a hook to be called just after data is fetch()'d from the server.

  Convenience methods
   "to_csv($rows, \%params);"
    Convert the given query result rows in @rows to a CSV string. If each
    row is a hash, a header row will be included by the default giving the
    column names. This method also supports rows as arrays, as well as $rows
    itself being a hash ref.

    Valid parameters in %params:

    "sep"
        The separator to use between columns.

    "quote"
        The quote to use in cases where values contain the separator. If a
        quote is found in a value, it is converted to two quotes and then
        the whole value is quoted.

    "no_header"
        If set to a true value, do not output the header row containing the
        column names.

    Aliases: toCsv()

   "to_xml($data, \%params)"
    Converts $data to xml. $data is expected to be either a hash ref or a
    reference to an array of hash refs. If $data is an array ref, enclosing
    tags are put around each record. The tags are named "record" by default
    but can be changed by specifying record_tag in %params. If
    $params{indent} is set to a true value, tags will be indented and unix
    newlines inserted. This method does not output an encoding
    specification, e.g.,

         <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>

    Aliases: toXml()

   "bencode($data)"
    Returns the bencoded representation of $data (arbitrary datastructure --
    but not objects). This module extends the bencode scheme to support
    undef. See <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bencode> for details on the
    bencode encoding.

    Aliases: bEncode()

   "bdecode($encoded_str)"
    The opposite of "bencode()". Returns the deserialized data from the
    bencoded string.

    Aliases: bDecode()

   "to_json($data)"
    Returns the JSON representation of $data (arbitrary datastructure -- but
    not objects). See http://www.json.org/ or
    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON for details. In this implementation,
    hash keys are sorted so that the output is consistent.

  There are also underscore_separated versions of these methods.
    E.g., "nativeSelectLoop()" becomes "native_select_loop()"
