NAME

    Alien::unibilium - Alien wrapping for unibilium

DESCRIPTION

    This CPAN distribution wraps the C library unibilium in a wrapper
    suitable to drive CPAN and other Perl-related build infrastructure.

    If the C library is already installed and known by pkg-config, this
    module provides a simple access to its configuration. If not, the
    process of installing it will install a locally-bundled copy of the
    library into perl's arch-specific library directory.

    This module bundles a patched version of unibilium version v2.0.0,
    containing the pending upstream pull-request #39.

METHODS

    This module behaves like ExtUtils::PkgConfig, responding to the same
    methods, except that the module name is implied. Thus, the
    configuration can be obtained by calling

     $cflags = Alien::unibilium->cflags
     $libs = Alien::unibilium->libs
    
     $ok = Alien::unibilium->atleast_version( $version )
    
     etc...
