  [INCOMPATIBILITY]

    * explicitly requires Perl 5.10.0.

  [API_CHANGE]

    * native iterators must use the 'self' rather than 'set_self'
      attributes to provide access to the closed-over self.

  [REFACTOR]

    * new iterator exhaustion model cleanly separates exhaustion
      transition policies (return/throw) and handling imported
      iterables' policies (pass through, replace).

    * robust handling of imported iterables exhaustion sentinels or
      exceptions.

  [BUILD]

    * now uses Module::Build::Tiny


0.10      2018-09-16 18:21:49-04:00 America/New_York

  [REFACTOR]

    * Internal refactor to improve performance and simplify code

    * Iterator classes are constructed directly without requiring
      parsing of the attribute hash.

    * Only existing class based iterators should/can be frozen.

    * ITERATOR_BASE has been removed.  The idea was never thought completely
      through. Still haven't worked out how to change base class for

    * on-the-fly creation of iterators is now in Factory.


0.09      2018-06-01 13:10:56-04:00 America/New_York

  [BUG FIX]

    * sequence iterator was not numerically stable for
      real number sequences, as it used repeated sums
      instead of a multiply.

0.08      2018-05-18 15:12:15-04:00 America/New_York

  [ENHANCEMENT]

    * new iterator, Cycle/icycle, cycles through an array.


0.07      2018-05-14 10:49:43-04:00 America/New_York

  [BUG FIX]

    * subsequent creation of iterators with a method
      did not incorporate the method

0.06      2018-05-07 12:21:27-04:00 America/New_York


  [BUG FIX]

    * method for detecting existing method roles was broken


0.05      2018-05-07 12:21:27-04:00 America/New_York

  [ENHANCEMENT]

    * arbitrary methods may be added to iterator classes


0.04      2018-05-04 17:21:15-04:00 America/New_York

  [BUG FIXES]

    * ifreeze properly handles exhausted predicates

  [ENHANCEMENT]

    * new iterator method "may", indicates if it and it's dependencies
      support a method.

    * more optimization; should make things faster (by some unknown amount)

  [INTERNAL CHANGES]

    * move implementation of iterators out of Flex and into
      separate classes.



0.03      2018-01-16 13:27:23-05:00 America/New_York

  [ BUG FIX ]

    * thawing an iproduct iterator with labeled iterator arguments was
      borken.

0.02      2018-01-16 13:27:23-05:00 America/New_York

  [ ENHANCEMENTS ]

    * new iterator functions: ifreeze, icache
    * new ':all' export tag
    * add support for current() method
    * new spec on what prev/current/next return as function of iterator state


  [ BUG FIXES ]


    * iproduct needs dependent iterators to have memory of last and
      current values when freezing.  rewind() is renamed to reset(),
      and new rewind retains current/prev values.

    * iterator states were always set to <active> when next was called.
      now the state is updated to <active> only if it was <inactive>.


0.01      2018-01-05 16:36:29-05:00 America/New_York

* First release upon an unsuspecting world.
