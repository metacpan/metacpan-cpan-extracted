EXAMPLES

  This directory was added as of version 1.12, and I expect that I'll add more examples as time goes on. Refer to the tutorial that comes with Tk-JComboBox for more examples.

Contents:

* select.pl - Example demonstrating ways of getting selection.
* simpleRO.pl - Simple JComboBox in readonly mode (from the tutorial)
* simpleEd.pl - Simple JComboBox in editble mode (from the tutorial)
* popupCreate.pl - Example of the -popupcreate option in action
