NAME

    Test::RandomCheck - Yet another QuickCheck for Perl

SYNOPSIS

      use Test::RandomCheck;
      use Test::RandomCheck::Generator;
      use Test::More;
    
      sub my_length { ... }
    
      # Define types of values which is used while testing.
      my $type_of_arguments = concat(string, string);
    
      random_ok {
          my ($s1, $s2) = @_;
          # Write a property which the my_length has.
          my_length($s1) + my_length($s2) == my_length($s1 . $s2);
      } $type_of_arguments;
    
      done_testing;

DESCRIPTION

    THIS IS EXPERIMENTAL!

    Test::RandomCheck is an implementation of QuickCheck in Perl.

    You may want to define any kind of test arguments by using conbinators
    prepared by Test::RandomCheck::Generator.

FUNCTIONS

    <random_ok { ... } $generator;>

      Run blocks with arguments generated by $generator. $generator must
      have arbitrary() method which returns the
      Test::RandomCheck::Generator instance.

      It outputs "OK" if the block returns the true value for all random
      petterns.

SEE ALSO

    http://hackage.haskell.org/package/QuickCheck is a test library for
    Haskell to define properties of functions and to run tests randomly.

    Test::LectroTest is another implementation of QuickTest which uses the
    source code filter and has haskell like syntax (CamelCase class names).
