$MODULE = "MLDBM::Sync"; $VERSION = '.30'; $DATE = '2002/07/03';

+ Added MLDBM to the list of PREREQ_PM modules for better CPAN installation

$MODULE = "MLDBM::Sync"; $VERSION = .27; $DATE = '2002/06/23';

+ Added note to error for Lock upgrade during ReadLock
  for case of doing unintentional write with construct like:
  
    tied(%dbm)->ReadLock;
    my $v = $dbm{'key'}{'key2'}; # will error with write !!
                 ^^^^^^^^^
  Thanks to Steve Keith for noting this bizarre perl behavior.

+ bench/bench_sync.pl now creates a test dbm in the local directory
  being run instead of /tmp ... benchmark results were being skewed
  since /tmp could be a fast RAM cache file system like tmpfs on Linux

+ Added MANIFEST.SKIP for building

+ t/taint.t perl taint check test added.

+ escape inbound file parameter for safe taint checking

$MODULE = "MLDBM::Sync"; $VERSION = .25; $DATE = '2001/11/11';

+ Honors the $MLDBM::RemoveTaint setting when MLDBM::Sync object is created,
  storing for later creation of the MLDBM tied object

$MODULE = "MLDBM::Sync"; $VERSION = .23; $DATE = '2001/11/08';

+ Updated AUTHORS section with perl license reference.

+ ./bench/bench_sync.pl has -n argument to specify # of reads/writes
  where default is 100

+ ./bench/bench_sync.pl has --bundle argument to allows for reads/writes
  in locked sections of that #, which improves performance.

+ $dbm->Size() for Tie::TextDir now adds size of directory as
  reported by OS.  This still does not seem to take into account
  the extra file inode overhead on a file system like ext2 linux
  but its better now at least.

$MODULE = "MLDBM::Sync"; $VERSION = .21; $DATE = '2001/10/31';

+ Added support in CLEAR() & SyncSize() for a tie directory
  based data structure like Tie::TextDir

$MODULE = "MLDBM::Sync"; $VERSION = .19; $DATE = '2001/10/15';

- Fixed keys(%hash), where one of the keys was boolean FALSE
  like '', or 0.  Bug found by Elliot Glaysher.

$MODULE = "MLDBM::Sync"; $VERSION = .17; $DATE = '2001/10/11';

- Make EXISTS safe after explicity tied hash ReadLock()

- For loops in MLDBM::Sync::SDBM_File that are friendlier 
  to perl5.004_04

- Better Lock() return value, whether or not a lock has
  previously been acquired

$MODULE = "MLDBM::Sync"; $VERSION = .15; $DATE = '2001/09/21';

- API fixes for easier integration with Apache::ASP

- Made $sync_dbm->UnLock() repeatable, with the next
  $sync_dbm->Lock() still working.

$MODULE = "MLDBM::Sync"; $VERSION = .11; $DATE = '2001/09/12';

++ Taking module out of BETA.  Been using it in production 
   for 3 months, and in development for 6.

- Bug fix for undefined warning in MLDBM::Sync::SDBM_File

- MLDBM::Sync::SDBM_File STORE() now deletes prior key parts
  before storing the value, which will result in more correct
  behavior, there was a possible bug here.  Added a test
  in t/sdbm_rec_big.t testing for this possible error.

+ Deletion of lock file when calling CLEAR(), or %dbm = ()
  Do this after unlock, which _might_ have a race condition
  but haven't seen in in heavy load testing... MLDBM::Sync
  recreates the lock file every time if necessary, so this
  may not be an issue anyway.  Might be good to unlink before
  unlocking, but this might only work on *nix platformns,
  now Win32.

$MODULE = "MLDBM::Sync"; $VERSION = .09; $DATE = '2001/07/31';

- Bug fix for undefined warning in MLDBM::Sync::SDBM_File

$MODULE = "MLDBM::Sync"; $VERSION = .07; $DATE = '2001/03/18';

+ $dbm->SyncCacheSize() API activates 2nd layer RAM cache
  via Tie::Cache with MaxBytes set.

+ CACHE documentation, cache.t test, sample benchmarks
  with ./bench/bench_sync.pl -c

$MODULE = "MLDBM::Sync"; $VERSION = .05; $DATE = '2001/03/13';

+ Simpler use of locking.

- Read locking works on Solaris, had to open lock file in 
  read/write mode.  Linux/NT didn't care.

$MODULE = "MLDBM::Sync"; $VERSION = .03; $DATE = 'TBA';

+ $dbm_obj->SyncKeysChecksum(1) API documented.
  New internal format that does not store the original key
  with keys() & each() throwing errors now if used on this
  kind of database.

+ ReadLock() API added, that does a LOCK_SH internally.
  Also uses ReadLock() for FETCH and *KEY operations.
  ** WARNING: one may not ReadLock() and then write to the 
  dbm, or that will die in an error.  Must UnLock() first.
  Writes may only occur in a Lock() section, which does a 
  LOCK_EX internally.

+ Better backward compatibility with old SDBM_Files
  for MLDBM::Sync::SDBM_File, also new format not compatible
  with .01 format.

+ Better test for MLDBM::Sync::SDBM_File, using keys with
  odd characters.

$MODULE = "MLDBM::Sync"; $VERSION = .01; $DATE = '2001/02/07';

+ Initial release with flock concurrent access control to 
  MLDBM databases.  

+ Also MLDBM::Sync::SDBM_File wrapper for getting around the 
  1024 byte / record limitation for sDBM_File.  Writes data
  in segments of 128 bytes.  This was created because SDBM_File
  access is an order of magnitude faster than DB_File on Linux
  with tie/untie per write in the MLDBM::Sync model, which is 
  for i/o flushing do dbms don't get corrupt.  

  But, then one has to worry about exceeding the 1024 byte limit, 
  which can happen for serializing larger objects.  Well worry
  no more!
