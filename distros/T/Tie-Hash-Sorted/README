Tie::Hash::Sorted version 0.10
===========================

INTRODUCTION
This module allows you to retrieve keys/values from a hash in a sorted order.


COMPARISON
Q:  Is this module any different from Tie::IxHash or Tie::SortHash?
A:  Yes, let me explain

Tie::IxHash vs Tie::Hash::Sorted:
  Tie::IxHash:
    Preserves insertion order
    Provides two sort routines, SortByKey & SortByValue, using textual compare
  Tie::Hash::Sorted
    Order is maintained regardless of insertion order
    Arbitrary sorting, may be changed at any time

Tie::SortHash vs Tie::Hash::Sorted
  Tie::SortHash:
     Uses pseudo hashes (a deprecated perl feature)
     Uses eval("...") for sorting
     To generate the sorted list one time:
        Re-sort the list as many times as there are keys
        Loop over the hash as many times as there are keys, stopping on match
        Compare current key against last key (keys^2 + keys)/2 times
     Slow
     No support for lexical variables in sorting code
     Inflexible calling syntax
  Tie::Hash::Sorted
     Uses no deprecated perl features (tested from 5.004_3 .. 5.8.1)
     Uses a proper code reference
     To generate the sorted list one time:
        Potentially re-sort the list one time
        Add one to an iterator, and lookup the corresponding array element        
     Potentially slow but with opportunities for optimization
     Supports lexicals, closures, etc
     flexible/expandable calling syntax

WHY I WROTE IT
Tie::SortHash was a perfect answer to a question on PerlMonks
(http://www.perlmonks.org) Unfortunately it had a lot of issues with it and I
received no response from the author. Originally, I wanted an drop in
replacement, but it became nearly impossible to do that and maintain
backwards compatability.
