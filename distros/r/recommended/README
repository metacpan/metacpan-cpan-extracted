NAME
    recommended - Load recommended modules on demand when available

VERSION
    version 0.003

SYNOPSIS
        use recommended 'Foo::Bar', {
            'Bar::Baz' => '1.23',
            'Wibble'   => '0.14',
        };

        if ( recommended->has( 'Foo::Bar' ) ) {
            # do something with Foo::Bar
        }

        # default version required
        if ( recommended->has( 'Wibble' ) ) {
            # do something with Wibble if >= version 0.14
        }

        # custom version required
        if ( recommended->has( 'Wibble', '0.10' ) ) {
            # do something with Wibble if >= version 0.10
        }

DESCRIPTION
    This module gathers a list of recommended modules and versions and
    provides means to check if they are available. It is a thin veneer
    around Module::Runtime.

    There are two major benefits over using Module::Runtime directly:

    *   Self-documents recommended modules together with versions at the top
        of your code, while still loading them on demand elsewhere.

    *   Dies if a recommended module exists but fails to compile, but
        doesn't die if the module is missing or the version is insufficient.
        This is not something that Module::Runtime offers in a single
        subroutine.

USAGE
  import
        use recommended 'Foo::Bar', {
            'Bar::Baz' => '1.23',
            'Wibble'   => '0.14',
        };

    Scalar import arguments are treated as module names with a minimum
    required version of zero. Hash references are treated as
    module/minimum-version pairs. If you repeat, the later minimum version
    overwrites the earlier one.

    The list of modules and versions are kept separate for each calling
    package.

  has
        recommended->has( $module );
        recommended->has( $module, $alt_minimum_version );

    The "has" method takes a module name and optional alternative minimum
    version requirement and returns true if the following conditions are
    met:

    *   the module was recommended in the current package (via "use
        recommended")

    *   the module can be loaded

    *   the module meets the default or alternate minimum version

    Otherwise, it returns false. If the module exists but fails to compile,
    an error is thrown. This avoids some edge-cases where things are left in
    an incomplete state or subsequent normal loads of the module by other
    packages get a misleading error.

    The module is loaded without invoking the module's "import" method, as
    running import on an optional module at runtime is just weird.
