Text::Tokenizer version 0.4.6
=============================

Text::Tokenizer is fast lexical analyzer for processing text files. Using this 
  module you can create fast and clean config readers with few lines of code.
  Note: This module obsoletes/replaces my old and very ugly RcReader module
	(I hope nobody used it except of me :)

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL

DEPENDENCIES

This module is based on the code generated by flex (http://lex.sourceforge.net),
