Work towards HTTP/1.1 compliance and be usable in production.

- HTTP 1.1 improvements:
  - require Host: header and accept absolute URLs from HTTP/1.1 clients
  - support chunked encoding and timeout on reading content.
  - return an RFC 1123 Date: header with every response
  - minimal 100 Continue support
  - better close support

- seems like a good idea:
  - catch exceptions instead of having worker die

- new/changed features:
  - after hook support – runs after all other processing, just before response is sent.
  - rename 'logg' to 'note', add similar 'warning'

0 general code improvements:
  - remove prototypes
  - use strict in example.pl
  - remove passing http version to send_response
  - add PodCoverageTests to dist.ini
  - make $conn package global
  - tweak warning and bad_request
  - tweak timeout

0.005     2014-10-12 08:19:03+00:00 UTC
- store routes in arrays, not hashes, so that they can be defined in order
- add example2.pl

0.004     2014-10-12 06:00:25+00:00 UTC
- change 'delete' to 'del' since 'delete' is already a perl builtin function
- added support for multiple workers (default 5) and timeout (default 5 seconds)
- add "Server: limper/$Limper::VERSION" to response
- proper HEAD support
- dist.ini improvements and POD fix (thanks, garu!)
- remove dump_request(), and hence dep on Data::Dumper, so now this fatpacks nicely
- replaced Test::HTTP with the thing Limper was originally written to test

0.003     2014-09-21 03:37:31+00:00 UTC
- skip 002_limper.t if Test::HTTP not installed
