0.09   2011-02-26

- In Moose 1.9900+, attributes from roles no longer acquire the consuming
  class's attribute traits. However, you can apply attribute traits like this
  one to attributes in roles, and that trait is preserved when the role is
  applied to a class.

  See the documentation for more details.
