=head1 NAME

bot-basicbot-pluggable - A standard Bot::BasicBot::Pluggable script

=head1 VERSION

version 1.30

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This script acts as standard interface for Bot::BasicBot::Pluggable,
a generic framework for writing pluggable IRC bots in perl.  It
enables the user to administrate a full-fledged bot without writing
any perl code.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  bot-basicbot-pluggable --nick MyBot --server irc.perl.org

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item --server

The server to connect to. Defaults to I<localhost>.

=item --configfile FILE

Read config options from specified FILE. For a discussion of possible
value and format refer to the section CONFIGFILE. The default to read
the configfile found by L<Config::Find>.

=item --logconfig FILE

The logging configuration will be read from the specified file.
Please refer to L<Log::Log4perl::Config> for its format. The parameter
loglevel will be ignored if this options is supplied.

=item --loglevel LEVEL

Sets the bots loglevel to one of the following levels in decreasing
order of output: trace, debug, info, warn, error or fatal. Defaults
to warn.

=item --nick NICKNAME

Nickname to use. Defaults to I<basicbot>.

=item --channel CHANNELNAME

Channel to connect to. This parameter may be provided several times.
You do not have to prefix the channel name with a hash symbol, which
would have to be escaped in shell. It's automatically added for
you.

=item --password

Sets the admin password of the I<Auth> module. This also loads the
I<Auth> module implicitly. Please be warned that this password will
probably been seen on any process listing as on I<ps> or I<top>.

=item --module

Modules to load. This parameter may be provided several times. You
can call --list-modules to get a list of all available modules. If
you do not define any module via this option, I<Auth> and I<Loader>
are loaded by default.

=item --list-modules

Lists all installed modules and exits afterwards. No bot is started.

=item --list-stores

Lists all installed storage modules and exits afterwards. No bot is
started.

=item --store

Defines which storage module is used to save module settings. The
default is I<Memory>, which does not save any settings between
sessions but does neither leave any files nor need any special
settings. 

This options take a string in the form I<key>=I<value> and can be
specified multiple times. The value of the key I<type> define which
storage backend to load, all other parameters are passed to the
object constructor as hash reference. 

For example:

  ./bot --store type=Deep --store file=foo.deep

That command will create an L<Bot::BasicBot::Pluggable::Store::Deep>
object and pass C<file =E<gt> 'foo.deep'> to its constructor.

=item --charset

Charset to use for the bot. Defaults to I<utf8>, but you can use
any encoding listed in L<Encode>. The IRC protocol doesn't define
a specific character-set to use.  This presents a big problem,
because if you do not use the same as everybody else in the channel
you just receive garbage.

=item --port

Port to connect to on target host. This defaults to the irc standard
port 6667. You won't need to define this in most cases.

=item --command-line

The bot does not connect to any irc server, but will wait on stdin on
commands from the user. This mode won't actually work with a lot of irc
related modules like ChanOp.

=back

=head1 CONFIGFILE

The bot read a configfile either found by L<Config::Find> (usually
named ~/.bot-basicbot-pluggable.yaml) or specified on the command
line via I<--configfile> on startup. The file should be a syntactical
correct yaml file with a hash as its first level element. It
understands every option listed above and the special settings
parameter, which is a hash, where the keys are module names and the
value is a hash of configurable module settings. Easier to show
than to explain:

 ---
 server: host
 nick: bot
 settings:
   Karma:
     self_ignore: 0
 store:
   type: Deep
   file: foo.deep

All modules listed under settings are also loaded on startup.

Please remember that you have to escape hash (or pound) signs in YAML:

 ---
 channel:
   - '#botzone'
