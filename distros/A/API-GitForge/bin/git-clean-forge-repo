=over 4

=item $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/.config/gitforge/access_tokens/I<DOMAIN>

Where I<DOMAIN> is the domain name of the git forge
(e.g. "github.com", "salsa.debian.org"), this file should contain an
API access token to log in to your account at the git forge.  If
unset, $XDG_CONFIG_HOME defaults to ~/.config.
