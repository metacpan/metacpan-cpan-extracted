VERSION

    This document describes version 0.003 of MooseX::CurriedDelegation -
    released November 09, 2016 as part of MooseX-CurriedDelegation.

SYNOPSIS

        use Moose;
        use MooseX::CurriedDelegation;
    
        has one => (is => 'ro', isa => 'Str', default => 'default');
    
        has foo => (
    
            is      => 'rw',
            isa     => 'TestClass::Delagatee', # has method curried()
            default => sub { TestClass::Delagatee->new },
    
            handles => {
    
                # method-curry
                #   Note the hashref, not arrayref, we employ
                #   first arg is the remote method to delegate to
                #   second is an arrayref comprising:
                #       coderef to call as a method on the instance, followed by
                #       "static" curry args
                #
                # so, essentially:
                #   $self->foo->remote_method($self->$coderef(), @remaining_args);
                #
                # foo_del_one => {
                #   remote_method => [ sub { ... }, qw{ static args } ],
                # },
    
                foo_del_one => { curried => [ sub { shift->one }, qw{ more curry args } ] },
    
                # curry_to_self() always returns: sub { shift }
                foo_del_two => { other_method => [ curry_to_self ] },
            },
        );

DESCRIPTION

    Method delegation is awfully handy -- but sometimes it'd be awfully
    handier if it was a touch more dynamic. This is an attribute trait that
    provides for a delegated method to be curried.

USAGE

    Using this package will cause the relevant attribute trait to be
    applied without requiring further intervention. We use the standard

        handles => { local_method => delegate_info, ... }

    delegation methodology, however our currying is invoked when
    delegate_info is a hashref. We expect delegate info to look like:

        { remote_method => [ $coderef, @more_curry_args ] }

    Only $coderef is ever executed by the delegation. This means that it is
    safe to have any number of additional coderefs in @more_curry_args:
    they will be passed through to remote_method without additional
    manipulation.

ADDITIONAL SUGAR

    In addition, we export a number of helper functions.

 curry_to_self()

    This function always returns a coderef like "sub { shift }". That is,
    this:

        local => { remote => [ curry_to_self ] }

    is equivalent to:

        local => { remote => [ sub { shift } ] }

    is equivalent to:

        $self->attribute_accessor->remote($self)

TRAIT ALIASES

 CurriedDelegation

    Resolves out to the full name of our attribute trait; you can use it
    as:

        has foo => (traits => [CurriedDelegation], ...)
