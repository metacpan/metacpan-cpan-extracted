# Changes for DarkPAN::Creator

1.28 - Fri Nov 20 05:44:47 2009
	* Put relative paths in the indexer reports if you're
	using the organize dists option.
	* Update prereqs to latest version of MyCPAN::Indexer
	and CPAN::PackageDetails.

1.27 - Sun Nov  8 02:33:58 2009
	* Now you can set the Log4perl config file with the
	DPAN_LOG4PERL_FILE.
	* Refactored some bits in the Minimal reporter to 
	make it easier to override the bits that decide
	which reports to index.

1.22 - Thu May 21 17:44:59 2009
	* Don't index packages (such as bytes, DB, MM) that are special
	* Don't try to index tests. We don't need them to make DPAN

1.21 - Wed May 20 14:32:45 2009
	* Handle exit on our own to prevent applications using
	an embedded indexer from stopping prematurely.

1.18_04 - Sat May  9 02:07:47 2009
	* Worked out some inheritance issues. I really need to use
	roles.

1.18_03 - Fri May  8 16:04:26 2009
	* Clean up dist
	* Fix problem with _exit inherited from MyCPAN::Indexer. This 
	killed applications embedding the DPAN indexer
