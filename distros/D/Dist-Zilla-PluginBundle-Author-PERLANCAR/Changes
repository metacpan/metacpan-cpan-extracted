0.608   2023-07-07  Released-By: PERLANCAR; Urgency: medium

0.607   2023-07-07  Released-By: PERLANCAR; Urgency: medium

        - Exclude plugin for Task bundle: EnsureSQLSchemaVersionedTest.


0.606   2021-08-15  Released-By: PERLANCAR; Urgency: medium

	- Pull in Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR for
	  convenience.


0.605   2021-08-09  Released-By: PERLANCAR; Urgency: medium

	- Add plugin [MetaProvides::Package] (suggested by paultcochrane in

	- Add plugin: Git::Contributors.


0.603   2020-09-27  Released-By: PERLANCAR; Urgency: medium

	- [bugfix] Forgot to remove [PERLANCAR::Authority] instead of
	  [Authority] in bundles that want to remove [Authority] plugin.


0.602   2020-08-14  Released-By: PERLANCAR; Urgency: medium

	- Add plugin: PERLANCAR::CheckPendingRelease.

	- Replace Authority with PERLANCAR::Authority.


0.600   2020-04-03  Released-By: PERLANCAR; Urgency: medium

	- Stop using a custom FileFinder like this:

	      ['FileFinder::ByName' => 'FileFinder::ByName PERLANCAR' => {dir => ['lib', 'script'], skip => ['lib/Bencher/ScenarioR/']}]
	      ['Test::Perl::Critic::Subset' => {finder => ['@Author::PERLANCAR/FileFinder::ByName PERLANCAR']}],

	  because whenever we use @Filter then the name
	  '@Author::PERLANCAR/FileFinder::ByName PERLANCAR' breaks (but this can
	  actually be worked around using [@Filter / @Author::PERLANCAR]). For
	  an easy workaround at the moment, I'm adding a hard-coded skip list to
	  Test::Perl::Critic::Subset.

0.56    2017-07-07  Released-By: PERLANCAR

          later hook into the CPAN installer client for this.

        - replace ReadmeFromPod with Pod2Readme that is compatible with
          DZP:StaticInstall.

         - Fix run command (second '%s' is not filled by Run).

         - Depend on OrePAN for convenience, because my various internal
           Dist-Zilla-PluginBundle-Project-* bundles (which are based on this
           bundle) uses OrePAN to inject the tarball to various DarkPANs.


0.20     2014-01-09  Released-By: SHARYANTO

           Module::Build because the latter is deprecated from core since 5.19.


0.07     2013-09-09  Released-By: SHARYANTO

         - Switch (back) from ModuleBuild to MakeMaker. Don't remember why I
           switched to ModuleBuild in the first place, but now Module::Build
           adds deprecate notice for Perl 5.18+.
