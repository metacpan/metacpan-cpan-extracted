        - became broken in perl-5.18.0-RC1.

1.50    2013-04-07
    - Update the repository URL to its new location on GitHub.

1.49    2011-04-07
    - Some correctness and Modern Perl changes to the rss2html.pl
    script (it still appears to be very hairy.)

        - https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=56848
        - Thanks to Slaven_Rezic for the report.

1.47    2009-12-08
    - Made sure XML::RSS::save() can do its thing when in taint mode:
        - http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=52334

1.46    2009-10-08
    - Updated the E-mail address of Adam Trickett.
    - Removed the perl-5.6.x-specific workarounds and made perl-5.8.x as
    a requirement. This was done in order to:
        - avoid a workaround that also caused an incomplete test coverage.
        - avoid various test failures due to a problem with XML-Parser
        on 5.6.x .
        - encourage people using ancient versions of perl in production.
    - Convert all occurences of "new XML::RSS" to "XML::RSS->new()" everywhere.
        - a best practice.

1.45    2009-08-05
    - Removed some unused module requirements statements from lib/**.pm.
    - Added a note about date parsing/generation (thanks to an email
    correspondent).
    - Applied a patch by "David White" to have uppercase letter in
    namespace/module identifiers.
        - https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=48405
    - Added "resources" and "keywords" to the Build.PL.

1.44    2009-04-01
    - Applied a patch from Simon Wistow (after some modifications) to
    add support for multiple enclosures.
    - Added the t/xml-base.t test file from Simon Wistow to test for
    xml:base. Corrected for style.

1.43    2009-01-12
    - Fixed the date on the last entry on this changelog, to say "2009"
    instead of "2008".
        - http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=42304

1.42    2009-01-03
    - When transforming elements with attributes into hash-refs - make
    sure they are placed in the correct namespace. Previously
    <media:description> over-rided the plain <description>. (as in Flickr).

1.41    2008-12-04
    - Made the default keys for the channel link, description and title undef
    instead of ''. They become '' once they are opened.
        - http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=40686
    - Now keeping track of rdf:resource of <image> in RSS 1.0:
        - http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=3978
    - Made sure that channel/{link,description,title} are localized to
    the empty string before rendering, to allow for better backwards
    compatibility.
        - http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=40686

1.40    2008-12-01
    - Now outputting an arrayref of <skipDays>/<day>'s and <skipHours>/<hours>
    properly.
        - http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=40978
    - Now parsing multiple <category>'ies inside an <item> into an
    array-reference.
        - http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=38296
    - Now outputting an arayref of <item>/<category> prpoerly.
        - http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=38296
    - Parsing multiple <channel>/<category> into arrays.
        - http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=9729
    - Rendering multiple <channel>/<category> elements from array refs.
        - http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=9729
    - Now parsing multiple dc:items into an array
    reference (at least inside an <item>):
        - http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=6000
    - Added the modules_as_arrays option to parse repeatable module elements
    into an array ref.


1.38    2008-11-27
    - Added support for duplicate items of RSS modules.
        - http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=4495
    - Added support for multiple Dublin Core elements. One can point
    the field to an array and it will create multiple elements:
        - http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=6000
    - Now parsing several <skipDays>/<day>s and <skipHours>/<hour>s into
    an array reference instead of concatenating them together.
        - http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=40978

1.37    2008-11-18
    - Extracted the common parts of parse() and parsefile() into one
    method (Refactoring - Shlomi Fish)
    - Incorporated a modified version of a patch from Simon Wistow to
    add support for the "xml:base" attribute.
    - Renamed t/items-are-0.t into the more descriptive
    t/test-generated-items.t , to highlight its significance and make
    it easier to notice.
    - Enabled backwards-compatibility mode for the "description" item
    to not become a hash-ref by default if xml:base is specified.

1.36    2008-10-07
    - ->parse() now explicitly returns $self.
        - http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=34914
    - ->parsefile() now explicitly returns $self.
        - http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=34914
    - Applied a patch to change the RSS-0.91 DTD URL from my.netscape.com
    to rssboard.org:
        - http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=39780
    - Reformatted the Changes file to standardize on 4-space-indents.
    - Small documentation patch: (add_item with dc:date)
        - http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=39780

1.35    2008-09-13
    - Added a Module::Build-based Build.PL so we'll have an easier time
    with the META.yml and the Kwalitee.
    - Kwalitee - added "use warnings" to all Perl files.
        - now depending on at least perl-5.6.0.
    - Kwalitee - fixed the "use" statement of
    "Test::Run::CmdLine::Iface" to a runtime require.

1.34    2008-09-12
    - fixed a typo in the documentation of lib/XML/RSS.pm -
    "regardless" instead of "regarless".
        - http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=37916
        - (Reported by Reuben Thomas, Fixed by Shlomif).
    - fixed a code fragment - pop() instead of shift() for older
    items, and while() instead of if():
        - http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=39231
        - (Reported by Dave, Fixed by Shlomif).

1.33    2008-06-08
    - Allowed the end-user to customise the _encode() routine in
    XML::RSS::Private::Output::Base from XML::RSS using the
    encode_cb key.

1.32    2008-02-08
    - Fixed http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=25336 :
        - made sure the namespace specified elements can have a hash
        as a value in which case they'll be outputted as a standalone tag
        with attributes.
    - Fixed http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=25368 :
        - changed pop() to shift() to remove the oldest item in the
        example in lib/XML/RSS.pm, per the comments in the bug report.
    - Fixed http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=24329#txn-296761 :
        - updated the URLs for information about RSS mentioned under
        "=head1 DESCRIPTION", based on a Google search.
        - (Shlomi Fish)
    - Fixed http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=33001 :
        - made sure that isPermalink is true if and only if the isPermalink
        attribute is "true". Not if it is non-existent, etc.
        - this modified the behaviour of the module.

1.31    2007-06-29
    - Fixed the save() function to handle perl-5.6.x (and possibly below)
    where the ":encoding(...)" filehandle are not available (Shlomi Fish)

    - Removed some methods that were not used.
    - Added more tests to increase the test coverage.
    - Fixed a bug where prefixes could be specified with invalid characters
      because there was a range (.-_) instead of three individual
      characters (.\-_).
    - Many files were left in the distribution or Subversion repository
      that were executable but need not be. Made them non-executable.
    - Clean up examples/ directory and move generated files out of t/
    - isPerCould not parse Line '1.04 - Web Mar 03 20:49:43 2004' at /home/shlomif/bin/upgrade-to-CPAN-Changes line 40, <STDIN> line 271.
maLink / guid fixes (RT#23983, Shlomi)
    - increased the test coverage of XML::RSS up to 100%. (Shlomif)
    - SECURITY BUG FIX: eliminated a markup injection vulnerability in the
      taxo:topics output of RSS 1.0. (Shlomif)
    - Moved the append function, which is unused and cannot be effectively
      used, out of the main module and into the rejects directory inside
      the repository (but outside the module). (Shlomif)
    - Added POD for full POD coverage. (Shlomif)
    - Several other bug fixes. (Shlomif)
    - Heavy refactoring of the code. (Shlomif)

    - Added a regression test to
      https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=24742   (Shlomif)
