	* cleaned test suite and advanced version to v1.26

2013-08-06  Boyd Duffee <b dot duffee at keele dot ac dot uk>

	* re-vamped the Test Suite
		- changed all tests to use Test::More
		- uses is_deeply() to test array values 
		- added 00-load.t and moved the load module tests
		- added 01-lwp.t for the User Agent specific code
		- tests add [Test Suite hh:mm:ss] to their UserAgent strings
		- added sleep before subsequent calls to ADS to ease burden on remote server
		- general de-cluttering, moving print statements to diag()

	* Query.pm
		- removed explicit return undef statements for failure, as per
			Perl Best Practices, p199
		- agent() can now add information to the UserAgent string

	* Paper.pm
		- removed explicit return undef statements for failure, as per
			Perl Best Practices, p199

	* Updated all modules to version 1.25, just for consistancy
		(except where it isn't)

2011-07-11  Boyd Duffee <b dot duffee at isc dot keele dot ac dot uk>

	* Query.pm
		- applied same fix as #35645 to the followup queries
		- improved error reporting on HTTP::Request to include URL 
			and HTTP_PROXY in output
		- changed URL to access a new class attribute, accessible via the 
			ads_mirror class method

	* added and updated tests and released as v1.21.0

2010-02-10  Boyd Duffee <b dot duffee at isc dot keele dot ac dot uk>

	* Fixed bugs in Query.pm: 
		- #35645 filed at rt.cpan.org (Ampersands);
		- last line missing from data fetch (while condition tested 
			in wrong order)

	* updated tests to reflect current ADS values and test for bug #35645

2003-07-15  Alasdair Allan <aa@astro.ex.ac.uk>

        * ADS.pm: Introduced a placeholder class to get round a documentation
          bug on search.cpan.org.

        * Fixed MANIFEST problems and released as v1.20.7
                  
2003-07-02  Alasdair Allan <aa@astro.ex.ac.uk>

        * Removed some tests from t/*.t since the things they were based
          on kept changing and I had to update the module every time. The
          test quite is now somewhat uncomplete. This is not good. 
          
2002-09-23  Alasdair Allan <aa@astro.ex.ac.uk>

        * Query/Query.pm: Fixed a bug which meant that that followup
	  queries no longer worked with the new interface.

2002-09-03  Alasdair Allan <aa@astro.ex.ac.uk>

        * Query/Query.pm: Modified query string to reflect changes in
          the ADS interface, if you wondered where the Journal strings
          went this should fix it. Fixed handling of 500 errors as these
          are now returned under some circumstances by ADS when no results 
          are found.
          
        * t/paper.t: Fixed tests, same problem.  

2002-05-30  Alasdair Allan <aa@astro.ex.ac.uk>

          refereed, non-refereed or all bibiliographic sources are queried.
       
2002-01-09  Alasdair Allan <aa@astro.ex.ac.uk>

        * Query/Query.pm: Added start & end year/month options to the
          query module so that the time over which the query can be made
          can be specified.
           
2001-12-03  Alasdair Allan <aa@astro.ex.ac.uk>

        * Query/Query.pm: Added conditional test to see if $base_url is
