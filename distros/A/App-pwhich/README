NAME

    pwhich - Perl-only `which'

VERSION

    version 1.14

SYNOPSIS

     $ pwhich perl
     $ pwhich -a perl          # print all matches
     $ pwhich perl perldoc ... # look for multiple programs
     $ pwhich -a perl perldoc ...

DESCRIPTION

    `pwhich' is a command-line utility program for finding paths to other
    programs based on the user's PATH. It is similar to the usually Unix
    tool `which', and tries to emulate its functionality, but is written
    purely in Perl (uses the module File::Which), so is portable.

 Calling syntax

     $ pwhich [-a] [-v] programname [programname ...]

 Options

    -a

      The option -a will make pwhich print all matches found in the PATH
      variable instead of just the first one. Each match is printed on a
      separate line.

    -v

      Prints version (of File::Which) and copyright notice and exits.

SUPPORT

    Bugs should be reported via the GitHub issue tracker
    https://github.com/plicease/App-pwhich/issues For other issues, contact
    the maintainer.
