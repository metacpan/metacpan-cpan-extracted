NAME
    DBIx::Class::Relationship::Predicate - Predicates for relationship
    accessors

VERSION
    version 0.07

SYNOPSIS
        package My::Schema::Result::Foo;

        __PACKAGE__->load_components(qw( Relationship::Predicate ... Core ));

        ...

        __PACKAGE__->belongs_to('baz' => 'My::Schema::Result::Baz',  'baz_id');

        __PACKAGE__->might_have(
            'buzz' => 'My::Schema::Result::Buzz',
            { 'foreign.foo_id' => 'self.id' },
            { 'predicate' => 'got_a_buzz' },
        );

        __PACKAGE__->has_many(
            'foo_baz' => 'My::Schema::Result::FooBaz',
            { 'foreign.foo_id' => 'self.id' },
            { 'predicate' => undef },
        );

        __PACKAGE__->has_many('bars' => 'My::Schema::Result::Bar', 'foo_id');

DESCRIPTION
    DBIx::Class component to automatically create predicates for
    relationship accessors in a result class. By default, it creates
    "has_${rel_accessor_name}" methods and injects into the class, thus for
    that case we would have 'has_baz', 'has_buzz' and 'has_bars' methods on
    $foo row object. You can define the name for each one (or also disable
    its creation using "undef" as value) by setting 'predicate' key in the
    relationship's attrs hashref.

       __PACKAGEE_->might_have(
           'buzz' => 'My::Schema::Result::Buzz', 'foo_id',
           { 'predicate' => 'got_a_buzz' }
       );

       or

       __PACKAGEE_->might_have(
           'buzz' => 'My::Schema::Result::Buzz', 'foo_id',
           { 'predicate' => undef }
       );
