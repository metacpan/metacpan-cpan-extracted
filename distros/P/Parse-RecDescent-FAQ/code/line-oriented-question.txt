I want to use Parse::RecDescent to parse a certain assembly
language. In assembly, data is "line oriented", that is newline is the
statement separator. Simplified demonstration: 

command1 arg1 \n
command2 arg2 \n

Defines two statements. More than one statement on a line is illegal,
a statement broken to two lines is also illegal. 

Now, P::RD has an issue with newlines. It swallows them by
default. There is a workaround using the "skip" directive, but it
became tedious and my grammar code is full of <skip: qr/ \t*/>
directives. 

Is there an easier way ?

What I want, for starters, is a trivial "command arg" pairs for statements:

line -> command arg "\n"
