String-LCSS_XS version 1.2
==========================

String::LCSS_XS computes the Longest Common Substring of two strings
s and t. It is a C implementation of String::LCSS and uses a 
dynamic programming algorithm with runtime of O(mn) and memory usage
of O(n) (m is the length of s and n the length of t). 

Since version 1.1 it works also with UTF8 encoded strings.
