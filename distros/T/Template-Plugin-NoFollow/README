NAME

    Template::Plugin::NoFollow - Template Toolkit filter to add
    rel="nofollow" to all HTML links

SYNOPSIS

      [% use NoFollow allow=['www.example.com', '^http://example.com/'] %]
      ...
      [% FILTER nofollow %]
        <a href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a>
      [% END %]
      ...
      [% text | nofollow %]

DESCRIPTION

    Template::Plugin::NoFollow is a filter plugin for Template::Toolkit,
    which adds rel="nofollow" to all HTML links found in the filtered text.

    Through the use of the allow option, you can specify URLs that are not
    marked as rel="nofollow". This can be used to set up a filter that
    leaves internal links alone, and that marks all external links as
    rel="nofollow". allow accepts regular expressions, so you can be as
    elaborate as you'd like.

METHODS

    init()

      Initializes the template plugin.

    filter($text, $args, $conf)

      Filters the given text, and adds rel="nofollow" to links.
