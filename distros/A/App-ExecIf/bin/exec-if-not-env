=head1 NAME

exec-if-not-env - Execute command if certain environment variable is false

=head1 VERSION

version 0.01

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Usage:

 % exec-if-not-env RUN somecmd --cmdopt ...

The above will run C<somecmd> only if C<RUN> environment variable is not defined
or false (with the notion of false follows Perl, i.e undefined, C<''>, and C<0>
are false).

=head1 DESCRIPTION

=head1 OPTIONS

=over

=item * --help, -h

=back

=head1 EXIT CODES

99 on command-line options error.

Otherwise exit code from command is returned.

=head2 Couldn't the same thing be accomplished with shell?

Yes, you can also do something like this in bash:

 if [[ "$SOMEENV" == 1 ]]; then false; else somecmd --cmdopt ...; fi

But using this utility is simpler and more portable.
