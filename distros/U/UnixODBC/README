- Overview

UnixODBC.pm provides Perl programs with a subset of the X/Open
ODBC Application Programming Interface implemented by unixODBC
from http://www.easysoft.com/.  UnixODBC.pm also provides an API
that implements ODBC function calls for TCP/IP network host
systems.  Refer to the section, "Installing and Configuring the
Bridge Server," below.

The UnixODBC.pm Text-mode programs and Web and GUI data managers
can perform ODBC queries on local and networked systems.  Refer
to the sections, Text-mode Programs," "Installing the GUI Data
Manager, Tkdm," and, "Installing the Web Data Manager," below,
and the file, "INSTALL," in the tkdm/ subdirectory.


- Installing UnixODBC.pm

  The libraries themselves should be installable using the steps
  described in this section.  If necessary, you can install the
  bridge server and example applications as described in the 
  section, "Manual Installation."

  The unixODBC libraries, from http://www.unixodbc.org/, and an 
  ODBC driver for your DBMS server, should be installed and 
  working before installing UnixODBC.pm.  

  UnixODBC.pm also requires the unixODBC C-language include files 
  from unixODBC.  They should have been installed in /usr/local/include 
  when you install unixODBC.  If the header files aren't there, you can 
  find them in the include/ subdirectory of the unixODBC package.
  
  The dbms/README describes DBMS and driver installation for 
  MySQL and PostgreSQL.  It also describes how to handle 
  PostgreSQL exception signals that can cause Perl programs to 
  terminate.

  If you don't yet have either PostgreSQL or MySQL installed, install
  and configure them first, following the DBMS's instructions, and the 
  notes in dbms/README.  Then install unixODBC, then any additional
  driver libraries that the DBMS requires.  The Perl script 
  dbms/test.pl excercises the libraries and DBMS.  The script should
  be able pass all of the tests, or print meaningful diagnostic 
  messages if there are unimplemented features in the driver.

  UnixODBC.pm has been tested with the following versions of MySQL and
  Postgresql, and supporting libraries.

  Notes: 1. You don't need Perl/Tk unless you want to build tkdm.
         2. Versions of Perl prior to 5.6.0 might not provide 
            Sys:Syslog.pm and Storable.pm.  In that case you must
            install these modules also.
         3. MySQL no longer lists MyODBC on its Web site.  MyODBC
            is currently packaged with the unixODBC source code.
         4. Unixodbc.org only lists the most recent library release
            on its Web site.  The sourceforge.net project page 
            contains older releases.

  IMPORTANT - Each network host must have identical versions of Perl, 
  Net::Daemon, PlRPC, and the modules they require. 

  To build and install UnixODBC, use the following commands:

    $ cd UnixODBC-<version>
    $ perl Makefile.PL
    $ su
    # make install

  When initially installing UnixODBC.pm, the installation warns 
  that UnixODBC.pm is not installed.  If the installation warns 
  that other library modules are not installed, you should install 
  them before proceeding. 

  To run the test script dbms/test.pl, you need to have 
  installed the data in the dbms subdirectory.  Refer to,
  "Testing UnixODBC.pm," below.  The ODBC driver needs to be 
  configured for your DBMS and a data source using either
  odbcinst or ODBCConfig.

  Standard Disclaimer - UnixODBC.pm and the client and server 
  scripts were written with Perl installed in /usr/bin.  If Perl 
  scripts print an error message like:

    sh: ./client: no such file or directory

  It means the script can't find the Perl interpreter.  Either
  change the path on the first line of the script to the location
  of the perl binary (the output of, "which perl"), or create a 
  symlink /usr/bin/perl to the actual Perl program.


- Testing UnixODBC.pm

  UnixODBC.pm is known to work with MySQL and PostgreSQL on Linux
  and Solaris systems.

  Running, "make test," makes sure that the library modules load 
  correctly.  

  The dbms/test.pl script excercises the unixODBC API more 
  thoroughly.  For the script to complete, the DBMS must have 
  installed the test data in the dbms/ subdirectory, and you must 
  have configured a DSN for the test data.  Refer to the file 
  dbms/README for notes about MySQL and PostgreSQL DBMS's.

  Running test.pl is likely to result in at least a few errors.
  The script is designed to test the subset of ODBC API functions
  that UnixODBC.pm implements as exhaustively as possible, and as
  many different ODBC DBMS drivers as possible (currently 
  Connector/ODBC for MySQL, and libodbcpsql and psqlODBC for 
  PostgreSQL).


- Installing and Configuring the Bridge Server

  IMPORTANT (Again) - The versions of Perl, Net::Daemon, Storable, 
  and PlRPC on each host MUST be the identical.  Net::Daemon, 
  in particular, checks for version information when authenticating, 
  and PlRPC generates protocol errors when communicating with different 
  versions. Storable also relies having the same version of itself and 
  Perl on local and remote systems.

  Net::Daemon errors are commonly recorded in the syslog.
  Although you can configure the log messages, check the syslog
  first. Refer to, "Troubleshooting," below.

  The bridge server runs as user nobody and uses port 9999.  To
  change the configuration, edit /usr/local/etc/odbcbridge.conf 
  after installation.  The RPC::PlServer(3) man page describes the
  settings Example server and client scripts are in the bridge/ 
  subdirectory.  For further examples of writing Perl RPC clients 
  and servers, refer to the man pages for RPC::PlServer and 
  RPC::PlClient, and the ProxyServer.pm module in the Perl DBI 
  bundle.

  Install UnixODBC.pm as describe above.  This step also installs 
  /usr/local/etc/odbclogins which is necessary for the Web data 
  manager.  You can add host and login information as described below.

  If the installation proceeded correctly, the core libraries and 
  bridge server daemon should be installed in the proper directories, 
  and you should be able to start and stop the daemon by typing:

    # /usr/local/etc/init.d/unixodbc start
    # /usr/local/etc/init.d/unixodbc stop

-  Manual Installation 

   Install the bridge server manually with the following shell
   commands.

    $ su
    # mkdir /usr/local/var/odbcbridge
    # chown nobody /usr/local/var/odbcbridge
    # cp bridge/odbcbridge.conf /usr/local/etc
    # cp bridge/odbclogins /usr/local/etc
    # chmod 0600 /usr/local/etc/odbclogins
    # chown nobody /usr/local/etc/odbclogins
    # mkdir /usr/local/etc/init.d
    # cp bridge/unixodbc /usr/local/etc/init.d
    # cp bridge/odbcbridge /usr/local/sbin
    # chmod +x /usr/local/sbin/odbcbridge

  If everything is installed correctly, you should be able
  to start and stop the server by typing:

    # /usr/local/etc/init.d/unixodbc start
    # /usr/local/etc/init.d/unixodbc stop

  To start the server when the system starts, install the unixodbc 
  script in the same directory as the other local startup scripts. 
  Refer to the system administration documents for information 
  about how to start daemons during system initialization.


- Installing the GUI Data Manager, Tkdm

  The GUI data manager tkdm is installed when UnixODBC.pm is 
  installed.  Refer to the man page ("man tkdm") and the 
  tkdm/README file for configuration instructions.


- Installing the Web data manager

  The Web data manager works with the Web servers: Apache 1.3 and 
  2.0, and the Web browsers: Mozilla 1.0, Netscape 4.75, and Internet 
  Explorer 3.03.

  The document describes a configuration that uses 
  /usr/local/apache/htdocs as the Apache DocumentRoot directory and 
  /usr/local/apache/cgi-bin as the CGI script directory.  Make the 
  necessary adjustments for the system's Apache configuration.

  APACHE CONFIGURATION - Httpd.conf must be configured to load mod_perl, 
  mod_env, and mod_ssi, and use server-side includes. On some systems, 
  LD_LIBRARY_PATH in the server's environment must be able to locate all 
  of the libraries that the DBMS server, ODBC, and Perl require.

  The data manager is configured to be installed in the, "datamanager,"
  subdirectory of, "htdocs,"  or the directory named in the httpd.conf
  DocumentRoot directive.  If installing in a different subdirectory, 
  modify the directives shown below for httpd.conf accordingly, and 
  change the value of $folder in the CGI script, datamanager.cgi.  

  If the Apache server does not have server-side includes enabled,
  add the following lines to httpd.conf:

    <Directory "/usr/local/apache/htdocs/datamanager">
        Options FollowSymLinks Includes
    </Directory>

  For Apache 1.3.x, uncomment the following lines in httpd.conf.

    AddType text/html .shtml
    AddHandler server-parsed .shtml

  For Apache 2.0.x, uncomment these lines in httpd.conf.

    AddType text/html .shtml
    AddOutputFilter INCLUDES .shtml

  To add the path for all of the libraries to the server's 
  environment, add a line like this to httpd.conf:

    SetEnv LD_LIBRARY_PATH /usr/lib:/usr/local/lib:/usr/local/mysql/lib/mysql

  The specific names of the directories depend on the system's 
  Apache and DBMS server configuration.

  Then restart the Apache:

    # /usr/local/apache/bin/apachectl restart

  Then install the files.

    $ su
    # mkdir /usr/local/apache/htdocs/datamanager
    # cp datamanager/*.html /usr/local/apache/htdocs/datamanager
    # cp datamanager/*.shtml /usr/local/apache/htdocs/datamanager
    # cp datamanager/*.gif /usr/local/apache/icons
    # cp datamanger/odbclogins /usr/local/etc
    # cp datamanager/*.cgi /usr/local/apache/cgi-bin
    # cd /usr/local/apache/cgi-bin
    # chmod +x tables.cgi datamanager.cgi odbclogin.cgi

	Edit the path to the perl interpreter on the 
	first line of tables,cgi, datamanager.cgi, 
	odbclogin.cgi to the path of the actual perl 
	interpreter.  The path should be either 
	/usr/local/bin/perl, /usr/bin/perl, or the output 
	of the shell command, "which perl."

    # cd /usr/local/etc
    # chmod 0600 odbclogins
    # chown nobody odbclogins     # Use the UID/GID of httpd.conf's,
    # chgrp nobody odbclogins     # "User," and, "Group," directives.

  Edit each line of the file /usr/local/etc/odbclogins for
  the login of each system that has a bridge server installed.
  The format of each line is:

    host::user::password

  The user names and passwords need not be the same as those
  used to log in to the DSN's.  They simply need to allow the
  clients (either the CGI scripts or the command-line scripts)
  to log in to the bridge server on the remote system. They
  need to be actual users with passwords, with their own
  entries in /etc/passwd.  

  IMPORTANT - /usr/local/etc/odbclogins contains login data 
  for remote systems.  It is important to change the permissions 
  and ownership so that it can be read by the httpd server 
  processes ONLY (i.e., the CGI scripts).  Apache servers often run 
  as user nobody, group nobody.  The ownership of 
  /usr/local/etc/odbclogins should be the values of the User and 
  Group http.conf directives.

  Also, do a, "chmod 0600 /usr/local/etc/odbclogins," to remove,
  "group," and, "other," permissions from the file.  If this isn't 
  secure enough, you can also create a separate UID (www, for 
  example) and make sure to change the User directive value in 
  httpd.conf.

  Standard Disclaimer (Again) - The CGI scripts are written to
  find Perl as /usr/bin/perl.  If that isn't the location of the
  Perl interpreter, then either edit the first line of the scripts 
  to reflect the actual location of the perl binary (the output of, 
  "which perl") or make /usr/bin/perl symlink to the interpreter.

  The ODBC logo is modified from the XPM in the unixODBC-2.2.2 
  Data Manager source tree.  

  CGI script errors are recorded in the Apache error_log, even if
  they don't appear in the browser window.  If the scripts seem
  to work right, but the data manager can't connect to data sources, 
  look for the bridge error messages in the syslog, and consult the
  section, "Troubleshooting," below.
  

- Text-mode Programs

  The eg/ subdirectory contains example ODBC clients for
  locally hosted ODBC servers.  The scripts that log into a
  data source require the DSN, DBMS login name and DBMS
  password as command line arguments.  The client scripts in
  the bridge/ subdirectory, for networked ODBC servers,
  additionally require the name or IP address of the host
  system. 

  Documentation for the client scripts are in the man pages.
  The command line option, "--help," prints a brief help
  message.

    # alltypes --help

    Clients for local host ODBC queries.

      - alltypes       List the SQL data types for a DSN.
      - apifuncs       ODBC API functions that a driver implements.
      - colattributes  Column attributes for a title.
      - connectinfo    Connection attributes.
      - datasources    DSN's on the local system.
      - driverinfo     Drivers on the local system.
      - rssoutput      Output result set as RSS RDF file.
      - gutenberg.cgi  CGI query with Project Gutenberg data in dbms/.

    Clients for remote DSN queries are in the bridge/ subdirectory. 

      sampleclient and sampleclient2 - Testing ODBC function
      calls using the peer to peer bridge.

      - remotedsn      List the DSN's of a remote system.  
      - remotetables   List the tables of a remote DSN.

- Troubleshooting

  - Perl error messages similar to,

      <programname>: not found

    indicate that the script cannot locate the Perl interpreter.  
    The programs have this automatically configured during 
    installation.  The CGI scripts assume that the Perl binary 
    is /usr/bin/perl.  If it isn't, you can make a symlink
    from the actual Perl interpreter, or edit the first line in
    the scripts to the path of the Perl binary.

  - If a program seems to take forever to start, it generally
    indicates that the bridge server can't make a connection
    to another machine on a network, and usually indicates that
    a network system is not accessible.

  - "Failed to make first connection...," to a DSN generally
    means that either the remote bridge server is not running,
    the client was not able to log in, or the perl and library 
    versions are different on each system.  Check the installation
    and configuration of the bridge server (above and, "man 
    odbcbridge"), and make sure that you can connect to the remote 
    DSN with a text-mode client like remotedsn ("man remotedsn") 
    or remotetables ("man remotetables").

    If the data manager can connect to local data sources but not
    remote data sources, the problem is likely in the RPC network
    layer.  Ensure that the versions of Perl, Net::Daemon,
    Storable, and RPC::PlServer are identical on local and remote 
    systems.  Try connecting with one of the text mode clients 
    (remotedsn, remotetables) to help diagnose the problem.

    The servers at all levels (DBMS server, HTTP server, bridge
    server) perform caching on the local and remote machines.  It
    might be necessary to restart both systems, especially if you
    change the configuration of one or more systems, or upgrade
    the software.  Remember to re-start the bridge server if you 
    change the system configuration.

  - If you receive, "Unexpected EOF while waiting for server
    reply," errors while logging into a DSN, try restarting the
    bridge server from a terminal session.

  - "Out of memory during large request," and "Maximum
    message size exceeded," errors occur when the size of a
    result set is greater than 64 kb.  This is because the
    bridge server uses integers as packet indexes.  Try to
    narrow the SQL query to produce a smaller result set.

  - Error and/or status messages do not show up in the
    system logs.  The clients, especially the Web data manager,
    can record activity by the UnixODBC bridge server, the ODBC
    Driver Manager, and the HTTP server in up to three (that's
    right, three) different system logs.

    1. UnixODBC bridge servers and clients use the syslog,
    "daemon," facility to record activity.  If daemon logging is
    not enabled (i.e., there is no, "daemon.log," file), typically
    add a line like this to /etc/syslogd.conf, for example (on
    Linux systems):


      daemon.*                              /var/log/daemon.log

    Refer to the man pages for syslogd, syslogd.conf, and/or
    syslog.conf depending on the Unix version.  If the 'debug' option 
    in /usr/local/etc/odbcbridge.conf is non-zero the ODBC server 
    generates additional status and error messages.  Remember to 
    restart the syslog daemon after making configuration changes.

    2. The functions dm_log_open(<logfilename>) and dm_log_close() 
    in UnixODBC.pm and UnixODBC::BridgeServer.pm begin and end the 
    logging of ODBC driver manager function calls.

    3. The HTTP server records HTTP and CGI script errors in the 
    server's error_log.
