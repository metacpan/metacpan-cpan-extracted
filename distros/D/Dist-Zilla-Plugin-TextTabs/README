NAME

    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::TextTabs - Expand or unexpand tabs in your dist

VERSION

    version 0.03

SYNOPSIS

     [TextTabs]
     tabstop   = 8
     unexapand = 0

DESCRIPTION

    This Dist::Zilla plugin expands or unexpands tabs using Text::Tab.

ATTRIBUTES

 tabstop

    The length of the tabstop in characters. This is usually 8, but some
    people prefer 4 or 2.

 unexpand

    if set to true, then an unexpand is used on all the targeted files,
    that is spaces of the right length are converted into an equivalent
    number of tabs. The default is false, or expand mode.

 installer

    Instead of doing its work during the usual file munger stage, if this
    attribute is true (the default is false), then this plugin will munge
    just the Makefile.PL or Build.PL (or both if you have both) files
    during the InstallTool phase. This allows you to remove nauty tabs from
    the installer than may have been put there by a nauty InstallTool
    plugin (take care to put [TextTabs] in your dist.ini after the nauty
    installer plugin).
