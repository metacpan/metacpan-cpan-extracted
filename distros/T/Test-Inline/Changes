	- Updating Params::Util dep to 0.21 to avoid a problem on ActivePerl
	- Updating List::Util to 1.19 to avoid leaks on some platforms
	- No longer include Test::ClassAPI
	- Skip the false-negative failing readonly tests when testing as root
	- Changed some non-working code in a heredoc that should never be
	  run that was none-the-less breaking the RedHat package generator
	  because it naively scans for dependencies.

2.205   2007-07-12
	- ACTUALLY adding a missing dependency on Test::Script

2.204   2007-07-12
	- Adding a missing dependency on Test::Script
	- Correcting the script/inline2test version

2.203   2007-07-11
	- When overwriting readonly files, delete them properly first.
	  Don't naively assume we can write to them (obviously, duh) :(
	- It turns out that File::chmod is smart enough to correctly
	  make files readonly even on Win32. Removed all the code that
	  skipped on Win32. All platforms now equal again! Yay!

2.202   2007-07-10
	- Adding support for writing test scripts with read-only permissions
	- Upgraded to Module::Install 0.65
	- Moving bin/inline2test to the more correct script/inline2test
	  (this has no effect on where it will actually be installed)
	- Fixing another couple of kwalitee nigglies
	  (automatically via release tool improvements since last release)

2.201   2007-01-16
	- [% plan %] in test2inline templates is no longer compulsory

	- Added Win32 support

	- Moved t/t.data to t/data
	- Upgraded to Module::Install 0.62

2.103   2005-09-28
	- Removed Test::Inline::IO::File::VCS. It is incompleted, and never
	  should have been distributed in the dist.

2.102   2005-09-22
	- To handle people with problems installing RT and a few other
	  programs, add a dependency on Pod::Tests

2.101   2005-09-13
	- Rebuilding to synchronize with new Module::Install and
	  ExtUtils::AutoInstall
	- Tweaks the per-section test code to make more applicable value
	  appear in the failure summary.
	- Removed all remaining use of UNIVERSAL::isa, switching to a
	  more accurate Params::Util approach. Should allow for improved
	  extensibility.

2.001   2005-06-11
	- After determining Test::Inline 1 doesn't actually USE

	  the module 'Pod::Test'
