SYNOPSIS

        my $parser = Pod::Confluence->new(
            space_key => 'FooPod',
            packages_in_space => [
                'Foo',
                'Foo::Bar',
                'Foo::Baz',

        $parser->parse_file('/path/to/Foo.pm');

DESCRIPTION

    This module uses Pod::Simple to convert POD to Confluence structured
    storage format. The output can be cut/paste into the source view of a
    page, or you can use the Confluence API to push directly to the server.

CONSTRUCTORS

 new(%options)

    Creates a new parser to process POD into markdown. Available options
    are:

    space_key

      The spaceKey from the Confluence space this page will be added to.
      This is necessary to ensure all the links between pages are properly
      generated.

    packages_in_space

      This is a list of all the packages that will be in this space. When a
      POD link is encountered, this list will be checked. If the package is
      in the list, a local link will be generated. Otherwise, the link will
      point to metacpan.
