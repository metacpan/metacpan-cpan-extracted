SYNOPSIS

     use Log::Contextual qw( :log :dlog set_logger with_logger );
     use Log::Contextual::SimpleLogger;
     use Log::Log4perl ':easy';
     Log::Log4perl->easy_init($DEBUG);
    
     my $logger  = Log::Log4perl->get_logger;
    
     set_logger $logger;
    
     log_debug { 'program started' };
    
     sub foo {
    
       my $minilogger = Log::Contextual::SimpleLogger->new({
         levels => [qw( trace debug )]
       });
    
       my @args = @_;
    
       with_logger $minilogger => sub {
         log_trace { 'foo entered' };
         my ($foo, $bar) = Dlog_trace { "params for foo: $_" } @args;
         # ...
         log_trace { 'foo left' };
       };
     }
    
     foo();

    Beginning with version 1.008 Log::Dispatchouli also works out of the
    box with Log::Contextual:

     use Log::Contextual qw( :log :dlog set_logger );
     use Log::Dispatchouli;
     my $ld = Log::Dispatchouli->new({
        ident     => 'slrtbrfst',
        to_stderr => 1,
        debug     => 1,
     });
    
     set_logger $ld;
    
     log_debug { 'program started' };

DESCRIPTION

    Major benefits:

      * Efficient

      The logging functions take blocks, so if a log level is disabled, the
      block will not run:

       # the following won't run if debug is off
       log_debug { "the new count in the database is " . $rs->count };

      Similarly, the D prefixed methods only Dumper the input if the level
      is enabled.

      * Handy

      The logging functions return their arguments, so you can stick them
      in the middle of expressions:

       for (log_debug { "downloading:\n" . join qq(\n), @_ } @urls) { ... }

      * Generic

      Log::Contextual is an interface for all major loggers. If you log
      through Log::Contextual you will be able to swap underlying loggers
      later.

      * Powerful

      Log::Contextual chooses which logger to use based on user defined
      CodeRefs. Normally you don't need to know this, but you can take
      advantage of it when you need to later.

      * Scalable

      If you just want to add logging to your basic application, start with
      Log::Contextual::SimpleLogger and then as your needs grow you can
      switch to Log::Dispatchouli or Log::Dispatch or Log::Log4perl or
      whatever else.

    This module is a simple interface to extensible logging. It exists to
    abstract your logging interface so that logging is as painless as
    possible, while still allowing you to switch from one logger to
    another.

    It is bundled with a really basic logger,
    Log::Contextual::SimpleLogger, but in general you should use a real
    logger instead. For something more serious but not overly complicated,
    try Log::Dispatchouli (see "SYNOPSIS" for example.)

A WORK IN PROGRESS

    This module is certainly not complete, but we will not break the
    interface lightly, so I would say it's safe to use in production code.
    The main result from that at this point is that doing:

     use Log::Contextual;

    will die as we do not yet know what the defaults should be. If it turns
    out that nearly everyone uses the :log tag and :dlog is really rare,
    we'll probably make :log the default. But only time and usage will
    tell.

IMPORT OPTIONS

    See "SETTING DEFAULT IMPORT OPTIONS" for information on setting these
    project wide.

 -logger

    When you import this module you may use -logger as a shortcut for
    "set_logger", for example:

     use Log::Contextual::SimpleLogger;
     use Log::Contextual qw( :dlog ),
       -logger => Log::Contextual::SimpleLogger->new({ levels => [qw( debug )] });

    sometimes you might want to have the logger handy for other stuff, in
    which case you might try something like the following:

     my $var_log;
     BEGIN { $var_log = VarLogger->new }
     use Log::Contextual qw( :dlog ), -logger => $var_log;

 -levels

    The -levels import option allows you to define exactly which levels
    your logger supports. So the default, [qw(debug trace warn info error
    fatal)], works great for Log::Log4perl, but it doesn't support the
    levels for Log::Dispatch. But supporting those levels is as easy as
    doing

     use Log::Contextual
       -levels => [qw( debug info notice warning error critical alert emergency )];

 -package_logger

    The -package_logger import option is similar to the -logger import
    option except -package_logger sets the logger for the current package.

    Unlike "-default_logger", -package_logger cannot be overridden with
    "set_logger" or "with_logger".

     package My::Package;
     use Log::Contextual::SimpleLogger;
     use Log::Contextual qw( :log ),
       -package_logger => Log::Contextual::WarnLogger->new({
          env_prefix => 'MY_PACKAGE'
       });

    If you are interested in using this package for a module you are
    putting on CPAN we recommend Log::Contextual::WarnLogger for your
    package logger.

 -default_logger

    The -default_logger import option is similar to the -logger import
    option except -default_logger sets the default logger for the current
    package.

    Basically it sets the logger to be used if set_logger is never called;
    so

     package My::Package;
     use Log::Contextual::SimpleLogger;
     use Log::Contextual qw( :log ),
       -default_logger => Log::Contextual::WarnLogger->new({
          env_prefix => 'MY_PACKAGE'
       });

SETTING DEFAULT IMPORT OPTIONS

    Eventually you will get tired of writing the following in every single
    one of your packages:

     use Log::Log4perl;
     use Log::Log4perl ':easy';
     BEGIN { Log::Log4perl->easy_init($DEBUG) }
    
     use Log::Contextual -logger => Log::Log4perl->get_logger;

    You can set any of the import options for your whole project if you
    define your own Log::Contextual subclass as follows:

     package MyApp::Log::Contextual;
    
     use base 'Log::Contextual';
    
     use Log::Log4perl ':easy';
     Log::Log4perl->easy_init($DEBUG)
    
     sub arg_default_logger { $_[1] || Log::Log4perl->get_logger }
     sub arg_levels { [qw(debug trace warn info error fatal custom_level)] }
     sub default_import { ':log' }
    
     # or maybe instead of default_logger
     sub arg_package_logger { $_[1] }
    
     # and almost definitely not this, which is only here for completeness
     sub arg_logger { $_[1] }

    Note the $_[1] || in arg_default_logger. All of these methods are
    passed the values passed in from the arguments to the subclass, so you
    can either throw them away, honor them, die on usage, etc. To be clear,
    if you define your subclass, and someone uses it as follows:

     use MyApp::Log::Contextual -default_logger => $foo,
                                -levels => [qw(bar baz biff)];

    Your arg_default_logger method will get $foo and your arg_levels will
    get [qw(bar baz biff)];

    Additionally, the default_import method is what happens if a user tries
    to use your subclass with no arguments. The default just dies, but if
    you'd like to change the default to import a tag merely return the tags
    you'd like to import. So the following will all work:

     sub default_import { ':log' }
    
     sub default_import { ':dlog' }
    
     sub default_import { qw(:dlog :log ) }

    See Log::Contextual::Easy::Default for an example of a subclass of
    Log::Contextual that makes use of default import options.

FUNCTIONS

 set_logger

     my $logger = WarnLogger->new;
     set_logger $logger;

    Arguments: "LOGGER CODEREF"

    set_logger will just set the current logger to whatever you pass it. It
    expects a CodeRef, but if you pass it something else it will wrap it in
    a CodeRef for you. set_logger is really meant only to be called from a
    top-level script. To avoid foot-shooting the function will warn if you
    call it more than once.

 with_logger

     my $logger = WarnLogger->new;
     with_logger $logger => sub {
        if (1 == 0) {
           log_fatal { 'Non Logical Universe Detected' };
        } else {
           log_info  { 'All is good' };
        }
     };

    Arguments: "LOGGER CODEREF", CodeRef $to_execute

    with_logger sets the logger for the scope of the CodeRef $to_execute.
    As with "set_logger", with_logger will wrap $returning_logger with a
    CodeRef if needed.

 has_logger

     my $logger = WarnLogger->new;
     set_logger $logger unless has_logger;

    Arguments: none

    has_logger will return true if a logger has been set.

 log_$level

    Import Tag: :log

    Arguments: CodeRef $returning_message, @args

    log_$level functions all work the same except that a different method
    is called on the underlying $logger object. The basic pattern is:

     sub log_$level (&@) {
       if ($logger->is_$level) {
         $logger->$level(shift->(@_));
       }
       @_
     }

    Note that the function returns it's arguments. This can be used in a
    number of ways, but often it's convenient just for partial inspection
    of passthrough data

     my @friends = log_trace {
       'friends list being generated, data from first friend: ' .
         Dumper($_[0]->TO_JSON)
     } generate_friend_list();

    If you want complete inspection of passthrough data, take a look at the
    "Dlog_$level" functions.

    Which functions are exported depends on what was passed to "-levels".
    The default (no -levels option passed) would export:

    log_trace

    log_debug

    log_info

    log_warn

    log_error

    log_fatal

 logS_$level

    Import Tag: :log

    Arguments: CodeRef $returning_message, Item $arg

    This is really just a special case of the "log_$level" functions. It
    forces scalar context when that is what you need. Other than that it
    works exactly same:

     my $friend = logS_trace {
       'I only have one friend: ' .  Dumper($_[0]->TO_JSON)
     } friend();

    See also: "DlogS_$level".

 Dlog_$level

    Import Tag: :dlog

    Arguments: CodeRef $returning_message, @args

    All of the following six functions work the same as their "log_$level"
    brethren, except they return what is passed into them and put the
    stringified (with Data::Dumper::Concise) version of their args into $_.
    This means you can do cool things like the following:

     my @nicks = Dlog_debug { "names: $_" } map $_->value, $frew->names->all;

    and the output might look something like:

     names: "fREW"
     "fRIOUX"
     "fROOH"
     "fRUE"
     "fiSMBoC"

    Which functions are exported depends on what was passed to "-levels".
    The default (no -levels option passed) would export:

    Dlog_trace

    Dlog_debug

    Dlog_info

    Dlog_warn

    Dlog_error

    Dlog_fatal

 DlogS_$level

    Import Tag: :dlog

    Arguments: CodeRef $returning_message, Item $arg

    Like "logS_$level", these functions are a special case of
    "Dlog_$level". They only take a single scalar after the
    $returning_message instead of slurping up (and also setting wantarray)
    all the @args

     my $pals_rs = DlogS_debug { "pals resultset: $_" }
       $schema->resultset('Pals')->search({ perlers => 1 });

LOGGER CODEREF

    Anywhere a logger object can be passed, a coderef is accepted. This is
    so that the user can use different logger objects based on runtime
    information. The logger coderef is passed the package of the caller,
    and the caller level the coderef needs to use if it wants more caller
    information. The latter is in a hashref to allow for more options in
    the future.

    Here is a basic example of a logger that exploits caller to reproduce
    the output of warn with a logger:

     my @caller_info;
     my $var_log = Log::Contextual::SimpleLogger->new({
        levels  => [qw(trace debug info warn error fatal)],
        coderef => sub { chomp($_[0]); warn "$_[0] at $caller_info[1] line $caller_info[2].\n" }
     });
     my $warn_faker = sub {
        my ($package, $args) = @_;
        @caller_info = caller($args->{caller_level});
        $var_log
     };
     set_logger($warn_faker);
     log_debug { 'test' };

    The following is an example that uses the information passed to the
    logger coderef. It sets the global logger to $l3, the logger for the A1
    package to $l1, except the lol method in A1 which uses the $l2 logger
    and lastly the logger for the A2 package to $l2.

    Note that it increases the caller level as it dispatches based on where
    the caller of the log function, not the log function itself.

     my $complex_dispatcher = do {
    
        my $l1 = ...;
        my $l2 = ...;
        my $l3 = ...;
    
        my %registry = (
           -logger => $l3,
           A1 => {
              -logger => $l1,
              lol     => $l2,
           },
           A2 => { -logger => $l2 },
        );
    
        sub {
           my ( $package, $info ) = @_;
    
           my $logger = $registry{'-logger'};
           if (my $r = $registry{$package}) {
              $logger = $r->{'-logger'} if $r->{'-logger'};
              my (undef, undef, undef, $sub) = caller($info->{caller_level} + 1);
              $sub =~ s/^\Q$package\E:://g;
              $logger = $r->{$sub} if $r->{$sub};
           }
           return $logger;
        }
     };
    
     set_logger $complex_dispatcher;

LOGGER INTERFACE

    Because this module is ultimately pretty looking glue (glittery?) with
    the awesome benefit of the Contextual part, users will often want to
    make their favorite logger work with it. The following are the methods
    that should be implemented in the logger:

     is_trace
     is_debug
     is_info
     is_warn
     is_error
     is_fatal
     trace
     debug
     info
     warn
     error
     fatal

    The first six merely need to return true if that level is enabled. The
    latter six take the results of whatever the user returned from their
    coderef and log them. For a basic example see
    Log::Contextual::SimpleLogger.

LOG ROUTING

    In between the loggers and the log functions is a log router that is
    responsible for finding a logger to handle the log event and passing
    the log information to the logger. This relationship is described in
    the documentation for Log::Contextual::Role::Router.

    Log::Contextual and packages that extend it will by default share a
    router singleton that implements the with_logger() and set_logger()
    functions and also respects the -logger, -package_logger, and
    -default_logger import options with their associated default value
    functions. The router singleton is available as the return value of the
    router() function. Users of Log::Contextual may overload router() to
    return instances of custom log routers that could for example work with
    loggers that use a different interface.
