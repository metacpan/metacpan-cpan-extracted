DESCRIPTION
    `Hash::Filler' provides an interface so that hash elements can be
    calculated depending in the existence of other hash elements, using
    user-supplied code references.

    One of the first uses of this module was inside a server. In this
    server, the responses to commands came from external sources. For each
    request, the server needed to contact a number of external sources to
    calculate the proper answer. These calculations sometimes attempted
    redundant external accesses, thus increased the response time and load.

    To help in this situation, the calculations were rewritten to access a
    hash instead of the external sources directly and this module was used
    to fill the hash depending on the requirements of the calculations. The
    external accesses were also improved so that more than one choice or
    rule existed for each datum, depending on wether prerequisites existed
    already in the hash or not.

    Hopefully this explanation will make it easier to understand what this
    module is about :)

    There are a few relevant methods, described below:

    `->add($key, $code, $r_prereq, $pref)'
        Adds a new rule to the `Hash::Filler' object. The rule will be used
        to fill the hash bucket identified with key $key. To fill this
        bucket, the code referenced by $code will be invoked, passing it a
        reference to the hash being worked on and the key that is being
        filled. This will only be called if all of the hash buckets whose
        keys are in the list referenced by $r_prereq `exist'.

        If the user-supplied code returns a false value, failure is assumed.

        An optional preference can be supplied. This is used to help the
        internal rule selection choose the better rule.

        Multiple rules for the same $key and the same $r_prereq can be
        added. The module will attempt to use them both but the execution
        order will be undefined unless you use $pref. The default $pref is
        100.

        A special case occurs when $key is undefined. In this case, this
        rule is said to be a 'wildcard'. This means that the rule applies to
        any key that needs to be filled. Wildcard rules are applied after
        any matching rules (ie, after rules that apply specifically to a
        given $key). Multiple wildcard rules are selected based in the
        preference and availability of prerequisites.

        This function returns a 'rule identifier'. This identifier is the
        index that designates a given rule. Generally, it is only used in
        conjunction with profiling.

    `->remove($id)'
        Removes the rule whose identifier matches $id. The implementation
        actually does not remove the rule. Instead it marks the rule as
        non-usable.

    `->dump_r_tree'
        This method prints out a representation of the rule tree kept by the
        object. The tree lists the rules in the order they would be
        preferred for a given key.

        Output is sent to STDOUT.

    `->profile'
        Returns an array containing time profiles for the execution of each
        rule. The index in the array is the identifier assigned for each
        rule. Each slot in the array contain the accumulated time for all
        the invocations of that particular rule.

        Slot 0 in the array contains the accumulated time for ALL the
        invoked rules. This make it easier to find the most important
        contributors to the accumulated time.

        Note that time is only computed if the user-supplied method must be
        called. Whenever the hash bucket to be filled by a rule already has
        a value, this method will not be called and no time will be added to
        this rule.

    `->stats'
        This method returns an array which counts the number of times a
        given rule has been invoked and its user-supplied method has been
        called. The index into the array is the rule identifier, just as in
        the case of `->profile'. The 0th element of the array contains the
        total number of times that `->fill' has been called. This is useful
        to deduce how many times the rules needed to be invoked.

    `->method($val)'
        Which method to use to decide if a given key is present in the hash.
        The accepted values are:

        `$Hash::Filler::EXISTS' (default)
                The existence of a hash element or key is calculated using a
                construct like C<exists($hash{$key})>.

        `$Hash::Filler::DEFINED'
                The existence of a hash element or key is calculated using a
                construct like C<defined($hash{$key})>.

        `$Hash::Filler::TRUE'
                The existence of a hash element or key is calculated using a
                construct like C<$hash{$key}>.

        Reference to a sub
                This allows the user to specify a function to determine wether a
                hash bucket must be calculated or not. The function is invoked by
                passing it a reference to the hash and the key that must be
                checked. The function must return a TRUE value is the bucket is
                already populated or false if the corresponding rules must be
                applied.

        This allow this module to be customized to the particular
        application in which it is being used. Be advised that changing this
        might cause a change in which and when the rules are invoked for a
        particular hash so probably it should only be used before the first
        call to `->fill'.

        By defult, the module uses exists() to do this check.

    `->loop($val)'
        Controls if the module should try to avoid infinite loops. A true
        $val means that it must try (the default). A false value means
        otherwise.

    `->fill($r_hash, $key)'
        Attempts to fill the bucket $key of the hash referenced by $r_hash
        using the supplied rules.

        This method will return a true value if there are rules that allow
        the requested $key to be calculated (or the $key is in the hash) and
        the user supplied code returned true.

        To avoid infinite loops, the code will not invoke a rule twice
        unless `->loop' is called with a true value. The rules will be used
        starting with the ones with less prerequisites, as these are assumed
        to be lighter. To use a different ordering, specify $pref. Higher
        values of $pref are used first.

CAVEATS
    This code uses recursion to resolve rules. This allows it to figure out
    the value for a given key with only an incomplete rule specification. Be
    warned that this might be costly if used with large sets of rules.
