SYNOPSIS

    In your weaver.ini:

     [-Eval]
     include_modules = ^Foo::Bar$
     ;include_files  = REGEX
     code = sub { my ($self, %args)=@_; use Module::Load; load $args{module}; my $document = $args{document}; push @{$document->children}, ... }

DESCRIPTION

    DEPRECATION NOTICE: This module is deprecated in favor of
    Pod::Weaver::Plugin::Run.

    This plugin evaluates Perl code specified in your weaver.ini (or
    dist.ini). It can be used to do various stuffs that might be too
    trivial/short to build a dedicated Pod::Weaver::Plugin for.

    I first created this module to insert list of border styles and color
    themes contained in %border_styles package variable in
    Text::ANSITable::BorderStyle::* modules and %color_themes variable in
    Text::ANSITable::ColorTheme::* modules.

    Yes, it's a dirty (and ugly) hack. But it's quick :-)

CONFIGURATION

 include_files => STR

    Value should be a regex, e.g. /Foo/Bar/.

 include_modules => REGEX

    Value should be a regex, e.g. ^Foo::Bar$.

 code => STR

    Should be something like:

     sub { my ($self, %args) = @_; ... }

    sub { and } will be added if code does not have it. Code will be called
    with %args containing these keys:

      * filename => STR

      * package => STR

      * module => STR

      Alias for package.

      * args => ARRAY

      The original @_ passed to weave_section(). Note that weave_section()
      is passed:

       ($self, $document, $input)

      * document => OBJ

      Document object passed to weave_section(). This is the output POD we
      are building and this is what we're mostly interested in, usually. It
      can also be retrieved from args.

      * input => OBJ

      The input object passed to weave_section(). It contains information
      about the input (original) document. Can also be retrieved from args.
