NAME
    Package - The Acmeist Module Package Management Tool

SYNOPSIS
    From the command line:

        > pkg help

        > pkg new \
            --from=pkg/perl/dzil \
            --module=Foo::Bar \
            --desc='Foo to the Bar' \
            foo-bar-pm

DESCRIPTION
    "pkg" is your tool for creating distributable, modular packages, in a
    variety of programming languages. Perl 5 modules for CPAN, Python
    modules for PyPI, Ruby modules for RubyGems, etc.

    In truth, pkg is nothing more than a simple way to create a new
    directory of starter files, by applying a set of configuration
    information to a set of file templates. The information is all
    completely in your control. You can use other people's templates or
    create your own.

QUICK START
    Here's the quick and simple way to get started, assuming you are
    familiar with cpanm and "git". From the command line:

        # Go to the directory where you keep your repos:
        cd $HOME/src/
        # Get the base pkg directory:
        git clone https://github.com/ingydotnet/pkg-pkg.git pkg
        # pkg/README will contain a list of known pkg template repos
        # Get a basic pkg template. In the case, for a Perl module:
        git clone https://github.com/rafl/perl-pkg.git pkg/perl
        # Maybe get a more specific Perl module template:
        git clone https://github.com/rafl/perl-dzil-pkg.git pkg/perl/dzil
        # Edit the conf files appropriately
        edit pkg/pkg.conf pkg/perl/pkg.conf pkg/perl/dzil/pkg.conf
        # Now create a new perl module in the foo-bar-pm directory
        pkg new --from=pkg/perl --module=Foo::Bar --desc='Foo Bar' foo-bar-pm
        # Make another new module!
        pkg new --from=pkg/perl/dzil --module=Bar::Bar --desc='Bar Bar' bar-bar-pm

    That was easy.

TEMPLATES
    The main template repository is:
    <https://github.com/ingydotnet/pkg-pkg.git>

    The README in this repo contains repos for many other repos. You can
    easily create your own too. Just make sure there is a "pkg.conf" file in
    each template dir (even if it is empty). Template directories inherit
    from their parent directory.

    More doc soon.
