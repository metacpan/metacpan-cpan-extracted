NAME
    DBIx::Password - Allows you to create a global password file for
    DB passwords

SYNOPSIS
      use DBIx::Password;
      my $dbh = DBIx::Password->connect($user);
      my $dbh = DBIx::Password->connect_cached($user);
      $dbh->getDriver;
      DBIx::Password::getDriver($user);
      DBIx::Password::checkVirtualUser($user);

DESCRIPTION
    Don't you hate keeping track of database passwords and such
    throughout your scripts? How about the problem of changing those
    passwords on a mass scale? This module is one possible solution.
    When you go to build this module it will ask you to create
    virtual users. For each user you need to specify the database
    module to use, the database connect string, the username and the
    password. You will be prompted to give a name to this virtual
    user. You can add as many as you like.

    I would recommend that if you are only using this with web
    applications that you change the final permissions on this
    package after it is installed in site_perl such that only the
    webserver can read it.

    A method called getDriver has been added so that you can
    determine what driver is being used (handy for working out
    database indepence issues).

    If you want to find out if the virtual user is valid, you can
    call the class method checkVirtualUser(). It returns true (1) if
    the username is valid, and zero if not.

    Once your are done you can use the connect method (or the
    connect_cache method) that comes with DBIx-Password and just
    specify one of the virtual users you defined while making the
    module.

    BTW I learned the bless hack that is used from Apache::DBI so
    some credit should go to the authors of that module. This is a
    rewrite of the module Tangent::DB that I did for slashcode.

    Hope you enjoy it.
