=head1 NAME

Chart::Plotly::Trace::Pointcloud::Marker - This attribute is one of the possible options for the trace pointcloud.

=head1 VERSION

version 0.027

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use HTML::Show;
 use Chart::Plotly;
 use Chart::Plotly::Trace::Pointcloud;
 my $pointcloud = Chart::Plotly::Trace::Pointcloud->new( x => [ 1 .. 100000 ], y => [ map { rand() } ( 1 .. 100000 ) ] );
 
 HTML::Show::show( Chart::Plotly::render_full_html( data => [$pointcloud] ) );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This attribute is part of the possible options for the trace pointcloud.

This file has been autogenerated from the official plotly.js source.

=head1 DISCLAIMER

This is an unofficial Plotly Perl module. Currently I'm not affiliated in any way with Plotly. 
But I think plotly.js is a great library and I want to use it with perl.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 TO_JSON

Serialize the trace to JSON. This method should be called only by L<JSON> serializer.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=over

=item * blend

Determines if colors are blended together for a translucency effect in case `opacity` is specified as a value less then `1`. Setting `blend` to `true` reduces zoom/pan speed if used with large numbers of points.

=item * border

=item * color

Sets the marker fill color. It accepts a specific color.If the color is not fully opaque and there are hundreds of thousandsof points, it may cause slower zooming and panning.

=item * opacity

Sets the marker opacity. The default value is `1` (fully opaque). If the markers are not fully opaque and there are hundreds of thousands of points, it may cause slower zooming and panning. Opacity fades the color even if `blend` is left on `false` even if there is no translucency effect in that case.

=item * sizemax

Sets the maximum size (in px) of the rendered marker points. Effective when the `pointcloud` shows only few points.

=item * sizemin

Sets the minimum size (in px) of the rendered marker points, effective when the `pointcloud` shows a million or more points.
