              (A simple POS dot matrix printer control module)

INTRODUCTION
  This module was written to allow simple use of a Citizen iDP3540 printer
  that I picked up.  This printer is a typical POS (Point of Sale) reciept
  printer.  The module supports most of the text operations of the printer.
  In the future I may be inspired to implement the graphics features, but
  don't hold me to that.

  See the POD documentation for complete details, features, and usage.

INSTALLATION

  Follow the standard installation procedure for Perl modules, which is to
  type the following commands:

      perl Makefile.PL
      make
      make test
      make install

  You'll probably need to do the last as root.  If instead you wish to
  install the module by hand, simply copy it into a directory named Device 
  in your Perl library directory.

THANKS
	Iowa State University for selling surplus hardware for dirt cheap.
	(Otherwise I would not have this printer to play with)

	Larry Wall for making programming more fun than should be allowed.
