NAME

    Command::Runner - run external commands and Perl code refs

SYNOPSIS

      use Command::Runner;
    
      my $cmd = Command::Runner->new(
        command => ['ls', '-al'],
        timeout => 10,
        stdout  => sub { warn "out: $_[0]\n" },
        stderr  => sub { warn "err: $_[0]\n" },
      );
      my $res = $cmd->run;
    
      my $untar = Command::Runner->new;
      $untar->commandf(
        '%q -dc %q | %q tf -',
        'C:\\Program Files (x86)\\GnuWin32\\bin\\gzip.EXE',
        'File-ShareDir-Install-0.13.tar.gz'
        'C:\\Program Files (x86)\\GnuWin32\\bin\\tar.EXE',
      );
      my $capture = $untar->run->{stdout};

DESCRIPTION

    Command::Runner runs external commands and Perl code refs

METHODS

 new

    A constructor, which takes:

    command

      an array of external commands, a string of external programs, or a
      Perl code ref. If an array of external commands is specified, it is
      automatically quoted on Windows.

    commandf

      a command string by sprintf-like syntax. You can use positional
      formatting together with a conversion %q (with quoting).

      Here is an example:

        my $cmd = Command::Runner->new(
          commandf => [ '%q %q >> %q', '/path/to/cat', 'foo bar.txt', 'out.txt' ],
        );
      
        # or, you can set it separately
        my $cmd = Command::Runner->new;
        $cmd->commandf('%q %q >> %q', '/path/to/cat', 'foo bar.txt', 'out.txt');

    timeout

      timeout second. You can set float second.

    redirect

      if this is true, stderr redirects to stdout

    keep

      by default, even if stdout/stderr is consumed, it is preserved for
      return value. You can disable this behavior by setting keep option
      false.

    stdout / stderr

      a code ref that will be called whenever stdout/stderr is available

 run

    Run command. It returns a hash reference, which contains:

    result

    timeout

    stdout

    stderr

    pid

MOTIVATION

    I develop a CPAN client App::cpm, where I need to execute external
    commands and Perl code refs with:

    timeout

    quoting

    flexible logging

    While App::cpanminus has excellent APIs for such use, I still needed to
    tweak them in App::cpm.

    So I ended up creating a seperate module, Command::Runner.
