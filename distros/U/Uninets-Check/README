NAME
    Uninets::Check - Mini data collection framework!

VERSION
    Version 0.04

SYNOPSIS
    Uninets::Check is a mini framework to collect data. The main purpose was
    to provide a pluggable, easy to use systems data source with consistent
    interface that is independent from specific systems monitoring solutions
    but can still be used by them.

    On object construction all modules inside the Uninets::Check::Modules
    namespace are loaded and new() is called on them.

        use Uninets::Check;

        # create object and load modules
        my $unicheck = Uninets::Check->new;

ATTRIBUTES
  modules
    Hash reference containing all loaded modules with module names as keys
    and module instances as values.

        # print out loaded modules
        say for keys $unicheck->modules;

METHODS
  run
    Runs a check module's run() method with parameters.

        $unicheck->run($module, @params);

  info
    Show information on loaded modules. Calls the help() method of the
    modules and formats the output.

        # show info of all modules
        say $unicheck->info;

        # show info of specific module
        say $unicheck->info($module);
