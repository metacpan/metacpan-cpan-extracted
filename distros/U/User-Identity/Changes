version 0.91: Mon Jan  8 10:52:59 CET 2007

	The module hasn't seen changes for some time now, but that
	is because it works as expected.

	Improvements:
	- produced with newest OODoc, thereby
	  could remove version, mkdoc and mkdist
	- removed useless README

version 0.90: Thu Aug 26 14:30:51 CEST 2004

	Improvements:
	- Geography::Countries is not required, but optional so
	  [Nick Ing-Simmons] has installed too much.
	- Cleaned the docs on many spots.
	- new methods
	     User::Identity::Collection::itemType()
	     User::Identity::Collection::removeRole()
	- new methods
	     User::Identity::Item::removeCollection()

version 0.07: Mon Sep 29 13:34:47 CEST 2003

	Interface breaking changes:
	- User::Identity date_of_birth became birth... name was too long.
	- User::Identity telephone became phone... same reason.
	- For collections, new(user) was changed into new(parent).

	Improvements:
	- All items can now have their collections.  It's to the
	  user not to make a mess of it.  You can create collections
	  of collections, if you want to.
	- User::Identity::Collection::Item is useless when everything is
	  collectable.
	- Even collections can be collected.
	- Added base class for long-term storage: User::Identity::Archive
	- Added User::Identity::Archive::Plain, which is a very simple
	  text based way to specify items.
	- Added User::Identity::Collection::Users, a group of people.

version 0.06: Wed Aug  6 10:41:23 CEST 2003

	Released because of version mistake in MailBox

version 0.05: Mon Jul 28 18:34:49 CEST 2003

	Interface breaking:

	- Mail::Identity::email() renamed to Mail::Identity::address(),
	  otherwise some very confusion options would appear.

	- Mail::Identity::domainname() renamed to Mail::Identity::domain(),
	  which feels better.

	- Mail::Identity::address() defaults to Mail::Identity::name()
	  if no username or domainname are present.

	Improvements:

	- Added charset to Mail::Identity

	- Moved all modules to the lib sub-directory, which makes the
	  */Makefile.PL helpers redundant.

	- Added Mail::Identity->from(Mail::Address or User::Identity)

	- Added enough options to OODoc::processFiles() to be able
	  to join multiple distributions into one set of documentation
	  pages.

version 0.04: Tue Mar 25 08:19:13 CET 2003

	Fixes:

	- [Jorg Krieger] found typo's and saw that the ::System module
	  was not correctly produced via copy-paste: too many things
	  refered to e-mail i.s.o. systems.

	- implemented new classes:
		User::Identity::Item
