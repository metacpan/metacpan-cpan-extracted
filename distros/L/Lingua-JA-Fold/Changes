	- Mr. Watanabe a.k.a. 'heppoko-kyoro' has reported to me a bug.
	  The bug can occur with traditional folding. When the last folded
	  string has only a half-width '0', the letter will disappear.
	  Thanks to kyoro, the bug has been fixed.

	- A serious bug had been found and has been fixed.
	  That bug arose on the v0.05 bug-fixing for deletion of empty
	  lines, and also influenced on v0.06.
	  With that bug, a text to fold which has last line without newline
	  ending will fall into endless loop.
	  The bug was a result from a fault of a line-splitting routine.
	  Now with 0.07, the bug was fixed.
