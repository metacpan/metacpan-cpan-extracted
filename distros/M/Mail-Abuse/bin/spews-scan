=head1 NAME

spews-scan - Locate SPEWS records

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    spews-scan [-h] [-v] IP...

=head1 DESCRIPTION

SPEWS (http://www.spews.org) is perhaps the most controversial public
anti-spam resource. This tool eases the location of your network
blocks in the SPEWS database.

When passed a large (</24) subnet, it will be split in /24s and for
each one, a query for the first and last address will be attempted.

=head2 Do not abuse this script

In general, it is not polite to send large numbers of queries to a
host, as this might be interpreted as an attack. Use this scipt
judiciously and avoid long and repeated queries.

The following options are recognized:

=over

=item B<-h>

Outputs this documentation.

=item B<-v>

Be verbose about progress.
