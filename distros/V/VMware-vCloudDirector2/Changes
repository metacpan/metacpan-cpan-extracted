    - Converted to JSON API - quite a lot of internal hash structure
      changes due to this.
    - Partially converted test suite (incomplete)
    - Fixed the fact that all of the write methods (PUT, POST, DELETE)
      could never have worked.  At all.  Really!
    - Initial release so can go on with this as work-in-progress

VMware-vCloudDirector version 0.008 cloned and reworked.
