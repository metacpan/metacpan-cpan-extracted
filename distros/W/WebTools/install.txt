      Please keep structure of package and don't modify file names because you 
      may have problems with next version of this package! Also you can maintain 
      follow rules:
      You can't add additional variables into 'config.pl' file: Please create 
      your own config file for your private needs. (You can place your own 
      config files into 'conf' directory)
      You can't add functions into package libs and modules: Please create your 
      own! (You can place your own libs and modules into 'libs/additionals' and 
      'modules/additionals' respectively)

      READ THIS! IT IS EXTREAMLY IMPORTANT:
        Do NOT discard this document! You must read all this INSTALL.HTML 
      completely. It exaplain all problems generally in Web/CGI programming and 
      particular in WebTools installation. This file relate not only with 
      installation tips but with common security problems and holes! Don't let 
      yourself be misled with simple "make" installation how it described below, 
      but take care about directories, files, permissions, apache's 
      configuration and OS specific.
        Note: You can install this package ONLY one time and after that you can 
      run different scripts via webtools, so it is extreamly important to 
      install package properly (now I can install package in few minutes, but 
      you should read all information in this document and spend time in 
      installation!)
      REQUIREMENTS:
      Perl (Perl 5.005_03 or later should work),
      Unix/Linux or Windows 9x/NT/XP

      Recomended:
      Perl 5.6,
      Unix/Linux OS,
      MySQL server

      Prerequirements:
      Only DBI (for SQL access, respectively for Session/Users support)

      If you want to use MySQL you also need: MySQL module 
      For MS-Access you need DBD-ODBC 

      If you haven't SQL server you can use our build in FLAT DB (based on 
      DBD::Sprite)


      INSTALL NOTES:
      First of all you must have webtools package. It must be packed into one 
      tar.gz file.
      Please copy this .gz file into some directory and run follow commands:
      tar -zxvf WebTools-1.27.tar.gz
      cd WebTools-1.2
      perl Makefile.PL
      make
      make install
      make permissions
      make clean
      If you are under Win, you must use 'nmake'. In this case please change 
      'make' with 'nmake'
      'nmake' you can download from 
      ftp.microsoft.com/Softlib/MSLFILES/nmake15.exe (about 50kb). You don't 
      need VC++ to run nmake!

      When you run command: perl Makefile.pl, you will be asked to specify full 
      path to your future webtools directory. This directory must be into your 
      cgi-bin directory! 
      On my private server it is:
      /var/www/htdocs/cgi-bin/webtools
      but on my Win system it is:
      c:/Apache/cgi-bin/webtools
      (Please realize that you need HTTP access to your process.cgi script!)
      If you don't know where is your cgi-bin directory, you still can install 
      package...just choose another directory! (after installation you must move 
      your installed package to your cgi-bin directory and if needed, change 
      owner of installed webtools and its permissions mode).
      After successful 'make' you must check whether evrything is OK!
      Go to your webtools directory and check file mode of process.cgi it must 
      be: 0755 
      Also it must be owned by your user (you don't need root access to install 
      this package!)
      NOTE: You may have big problems depending of your OS and security 
      settings! To void this problem you must be very attentive:
      - You have only one real script: process.cgi, so it must be able to read 
      and write your files! So you must chmod to 0755. If Apache server don't 
      change user of script to your user, YOU must insure that process.cgi never 
      will try to read/write on directories where it has not access!
      To insure this you must know very well structure of Webtools module!
      webtools  ----- conf
                        |
                        +---- db 
                        |
                        +---- drivers
                        |
                        +---- htmls 
                        |
                        +---- jhtmls 
                        |
                        +---- libs 
                        |
                        +---- logs 
                        |
                        +---- mail 
                        |
                        +---- modules 
                        | 
      /tmp OR  +---- tmp

      For 'conf','drivers','htmls','jhtmls','libs','modules' directories you 
      need only 'read' access.
      For 'db' directory you need 'read' access (and 'write' if you use DB FLAT 
      - default)
      For 'logs','mail' you need 'read' and 'write' access (default these 
      directories are not used)
      You need also full access to 'tmp' directory (your system directory or 
      your own)
      Now let see some examples:
      ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

      CASE 1:  You are some good user(july) on some good free 
      host(newald.proscriptum.com) :-)))
      Let 'july' user has home directory:  /home/july (we use virtual host: 
      july.newald.proscriptum.com)
      His full cgi-bin directory is: /home/july/public_html/cgi-bin
      So  his webtools directory can be: /home/july/public_html/cgi-bin/webtools
      Now we can upload WebTools-1.27.tar.gz to our home directory and after 
      that to install script.
      After installation our process.cgi has permission mode set to 0755, 
      directories have permission modes: 0755 and any other files: 0444
      Features: 
      - Our host is virtual, so Apache change user to 'july' when we start 
      process.cgi!
      In other words we are ready to configure package whitout any hidden traps!
      Evrything is ok, so let run script: perl -c process.cgi

      -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      CASE 2:  You are some user (and you has not virtual host) under Open BSD 
      OS. 
      User: snm
      Server: www.jozefina.bg
      User home directory: /home/snm
      His full cgi-bin directory: /home/snm/http/cgi-bin
      So his webtools directory can be: /home/snm/http/cgi-bin/webtools , 
      please install package into this directory!
      Now let suppose that your scripts running with Apache's user (i.e. Apache 
      can't write into your directories when they has 755 permissions!). That 
      can be a problem, we realy need to write into db, logs, mail and tmp 
      directories, so we must chmod these directories to 0777 (BUT THIS IS 
      UNSECURE). To decide problem we must create these directories in our home 
      directory, for example:
      /home/snm/webtools/db
      /home/snm/webtools/logs
      /home/snm/webtools/mail
      /home/snm/webtools/tmp
      then we can chmod to 0777 these directories! (other user can't read/write 
      'snm' directory, so they can't access and these directories too :))
      After this you MUST move files from original(installed) directories to 
      directories we've just created (preserve attributes/permissions when files 
      are moved). Ok, is evrything done? Actualy not at all, you also need to 
      edit "config.pl". Please run 'pico' or some other editor and change path 
      to new location of db, logs, mail and tmp directories! (or use install.cgi 
      to modify config.pl file!)

      --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      CASE 3:  You have root access! Well is not a good idea to install webtools 
      with root access! You can login with some other user and install package 
      in directory you want and chown/chmod if need (using root). With root 
      access you can install package on way you want and can resolve problems 
      very fast (if you want you can run your scripts with 'www' user and so 
      on...). You can create directories (db,logs,mail, tmp ...) into some 
      private directory (where nobady except Apache can read/write)...
      NOTE: Please be very careful when install any scripts/modules with root 
      access. You bring responsibilty for your actions!
      --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      SECURITY SETTINGS:

      Before you can go life in web you have to check security settings of your 
      web server!
      Here we suppose that you haven't root access, so you can't make any 
      changes to server if any security fixes are required.

      - First of all you have to check ability of externel user to access your 
      directories:
      (If you are owner of web server and you are the only one user on it e.i. 
      no body else can access remotely) you can close your eyes and leave this 
      check unperformed. Other else you have to check whether other user can 
      "cd" your directory. If that is possible you need to fix that (contact 
      your system administrator and ask him to protect your directory of 
      unauthorized access!)

      - Secondry you need to check ability of web users to access and/or read 
      your datas and/or scripts:
      Immediatly go to your "webtools/htmls" directory and "vdir"(or "ls -l") 
      this direcory. It should contain file "env.html" and it shoultd be with 
      permission: 644 (or 444) depending of your OS defaults. These "htmls" 
      actualy are embedded Perl files, so it is extreamly important these files 
      (htmls) to be unaccessable and unreadable from Web interface i.e. line 
      like this: http://your_server/cgi-bin/webtools/htmls/env.html should 
      return NOT html page, it MUST return "Internal Server Error" because 
      Apache must interpret these files as scripts!!! If that is not true, you 
      have to set other extension for all files in webtools/htmls (.whtml , 
      .cgihtml , .htm or .cgi are supported) That mean, that you need to correct 
      all files that access these ".html" files (and given examples too). Other 
      solution (when you have access to server) is to forbid ".html" to be read 
      in cgi-bin directory (you need to edit httpd.conf -> please read Apache's 
      documentation to learn how to do that).
      NOTE: You can configure config.pl so extensions .whtml, .cgihtml and so on 
      to be treated as .html!!!

      - Finnaly solution (and in many cases the best): 
      You can install webtools into ../cgi-bin/webtools and after that you can 
      move all directories and files in your "secure" home directory where no 
      body except you can read/write these files! Ofcource you must leave at 
      least "process.cgi" in your web based cgi-bin/webtools directory and 
      "conf" directory too, after these operations you must edit your config.pl 
      file and mark changes of new webtools directory structure (you should edit 
      section "[PATHS]" in config.pl). That is all but don't forgot to set 
      variable $check_module_functions = "on" (that is internal build way to 
      check your configuration!)
      NOTE: Please preserve permissions of directories and files in.
      NOTE: Apache's should handle (in httpd.conf) .cgi and .pl file with 
      AddHandler!
      Example: AddHandler cgi-script .cgi .pl

      AFTER INSTALLATION:

      - Before you can be able to run any srcipt (and examples) you must 
      configure your 'config.pl' file!
      For example of configuration please read HELP.doc (found into 'docs' 
      directory)

      - If evrything is configured properly, then go into telnet(console) and cd 
      to your webtools directory.
      Execute follow line: perl -c process.cgi
      Evrything must be "OK" before you can go ahead. Now open one browser's 
      window and type follow url: 
      www.your_host.com/~your_user/cgi-bin/webtools/process.cgi
      where:
          ~your_user is your user name (remove it if you have your own 
      server/virtual host)
          cgi-bin/webtools is your http based webtools directory and
          process.cgi is your base (only one) script!

      Into browser's window you will see your current configuration. Please 
      check it for problems/errors.
      Clear them all and then set variable $check_module_functions to 'off'
      Now you are ready to lear webtools and run all examples into docs/examples 
      directory!


      INSTALL.CGI (WEB BASED CONFIGURATOR)

      At versioin 1.16 of WebTools, proscriptum.com released new feature for 
      easy making of WebTools configuration. This new feature allow remote 
      configure of config.pl file via Web interface i.e. you can make different 
      adjustment to almost every aspect of WebTools configuration. So at this 
      point I will recommend that script for configuration purposes instead of 
      manual edit of config.pl. Also with "install.cgi" you have unique chance 
      to create structure of MySQL and/or Flat DB without any additional work. 
      (for MS Access you still have to do manual work)!

      Get started:
      First of all you need to insure that install.cgi has proper permissions 
      mode (755 i.e. must be executable and install.cgi must be able to 
      write/read ./conf/config.pl and ./db/ directory)!

      I have to explain: install.cgi need to write/rewrite config.pl file so 
      please set needed permissions for conf directory and for config.pl file! 
      Also install.cgi need to create files into database directory (./db/)

      At last install.cgi must have correct shebang (default it is: 
      /usr/bin/perl) This rule is important for install.cgi on the same way as 
      it is important for process.cgi So it is not a bad idea if you change 
      shebang on these two scripts at once (of course do it in case of wrong 
      Perl location!)

      For advanced web programmers I will mention that install.cgi script is not 
      accessable on default (security restriction). So if you want to use it, 
      then you have to edit install.cgi (see first paragraph of script):
       - Set $install_script_available to '1' to enable script.
       - Set proper Admin user and respective password for script access!

      When you have done with WebTools configuration set again variable 
      $install_script_available to '0'! That will keep "hackers" away from your 
      server! :-)

      Work with install.cgi is absolutely clear. Just run script on that way and 
      enjoy :-)
