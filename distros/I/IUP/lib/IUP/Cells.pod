=head1 NAME

IUP::Cells - [GUI element] grid widget (set of cells) that enables chess-table-like drawings

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Creates a grid widget (set of cells) that enables several
application-specific drawing, such as: chess tables, tiles editors,
degrade scales, drawable spreadsheets and so forth.

This element is mostly based on application callbacks functions that
determine the number of cells (rows and coluns), their appearence and
interation. This mechanism offers full flexibility to applications, but
requires programmers attention to avoid infinite loops inside this
functions. Using callbacks, cells can be also grouped to form major or
hierarchical elements, such as headers, footers etc. This callback
approach was intentionally chosen to allow all cells to be dinamically
and directly changed based on application's data structures. Since the
size of each cell is given by the application the size of the control
also must be given using SIZE or RASTERSIZE attributes.

=head1 USAGE

=head2 CREATION - new() method

 my $cells = IUP::Cells->new( BOXED=>'NO', RASTERSIZE=>'400x300' );

=over

B<Returns:> the identifier of the created element, or C<undef> if an error occurs.

NOTE: You can pass to C<new()> other C<ATTRIBUTE=E<gt>'value'> or C<CALLBACKNAME=E<gt>\&func> pairs relevant
to this element - see L<IUP::Manual::02_Elements|IUP::Manual::02_Elements/"new()">.

=back

=head2 ATTRIBUTES

For more info about concept of attributes (setting/getting values etc.)
see L<IUP::Manual::03_Attributes|IUP::Manual::03_Attributes>. Attributes specific to this element:

=over

=item B<BOXED>

Determines if the bounding cells' regions should be drawn
with black lines. It can be "YES" or "NO". Default: "YES". If the span
atributtes are used, set this attribute to "NO" to avoid grid drawing
over spanned cells.

=item B<BUFFERIZE>

Disables the automatic redrawing of the control, so many
attributes can be changed without many redraws. When set to "NO" the
control is redrawn. When REPAINT attribute is set, BUFFERIZE is
automatically set to "NO". Default: "NO".

=item B<CANVAS>

I<(read-only, non inheritable)>

Returns the internal CD canvas (reference to L<IUP::Canvas>). ZZZ-test-this
This attribute should be used only in specific cases and by experienced programmers.

=item B<CLIPPED>

Determines if, before cells drawing, each bounding region
should be clipped. This attribute should the changed in few specific
cases. It can be "YES" or "NO". Default: "YES".

=item B<FIRST_COL>

I<(read-only, non inheritable)>

Returns the number of the first visible column.

=item B<FIRST_LINE>

I<(read-only, non inheritable)>

Returns the number of the first visible line.

=item B<FULL_VISIBLE>

I<(write-only, non inheritable)>

Tries to show
completely a specific cell (considering any vertical or horizontal
header or scrollbar position). This attribute is set by a formatted
string "%d:%d" (C syntax), where each "%d" represent the line and
column integer indexes respectively.

=item B<IMAGE_CANVAS>

I<(read-only, non inheritable)>

Returns the internal image CD canvas (reference to L<IUP::Canvas>) ZZZ-test-this
This attribute should be used only in specific cases and by experienced programmers.

=item B<LIMITS(L):(C)>

I<(read-only, non inheritable)>

Where (L) is the line number and (C) the column number - e.g. "LIMITS11:25". 
Returns the limits of a given cell. Output format is a string "xmin:xmax:ymin:ymax".

=item B<NON_SCROLLABLE_LINES>

Determines the number of non-scrollable lines
(vertical headers) that should always be visible despite the vertical
scrollbar position. It can be any non-negative integer value. Default: "0"

=item B<NON_SCROLLABLE_COLS>

Determines the number of non-scrollable columns
(horizontal headers) that should always be visible despite the
horizontal scrollbar position. It can be any non-negative integer
value. Default: "0"

=item B<ORIGIN>

Sets the first visible line and column positions. This
attribute is set by a formatted string "%d:%d" (C syntax), where each
"%d" represent the line and column integer indexes respectively.

=item B<REPAINT>

I<(write-only, non inheritable)>

When set with any value, provokes the control to be redrawn.

=item L<SIZE|IUP::Manual::03_Attributes/SIZE>

I<(non inheritable)>

There is no initial size. You must define SIZE or RASTERSIZE.

=item L<SCROLLBAR|IUP::Manual::03_Attributes/SCROLLBAR>

I<(creation only)>

Default: "YES".
