NAME
    Wais - access to freeWAIS-sf libraries

SYNOPSIS
    `require Wais;'

DESCRIPTION
    The interface is divided in four major parts.

    SFgate 4.0
              For backward compatibility the functions used in
              SFgate up to version 4 are still present. Their use is
              deprecated and they are not documented here. These
              functions may no be supported in following versions of
              this module.

    Protocol  XS functions which provide a low-level access to the WAIS
              protocol. E.g. `generate_search_apdu()' constructs a
              request message.

    SFgate 5  Perl functions that implement high-level access to WAIS
              servers. E. g. parallel searching is supported.

    dictionary
              A bunch of XS functions useful for inspecting local
              databases.

    We will start with the SFgate 5 functions.

USAGE
    The main high-level interface are the functions `Wais::Search'
    and `Wais::Retrieve'. Both return a reference to an object of
    the class `Wais::Result'.

  Wais::Search

    Arguments of `Wais::Search' are hash references, one for each
    database to search. The keys of the hashes should be:

    query     The query to submit.

    database  The database which should be searched.

    host      host is optional. It defaults to `'localhost''.

    port      port is optional. It defaults to `210'.

    tag       A tag by which individual results can be associated to a
              database/host/port triple. If omitted defaults to the
              database name.

    relevant  If present must be a reference to an array containing
              alternating document id's and types. Document id's
              must be of type `Wais:Docid'.

              Here is a complete example:

                   $result = Wais::Search({'query'    => 'pfeifer', 
                                           'database' => $db1, 
                                           'host'     => 'ls6',
                                           'relevant' => [$id, 'TEXT']},
                                          {'query'    => 'pfeifer', 
                                           'database' => $db2});

              If *host* is `'localhost'' and *database*`.src'
              exists, local search is performed instead of
              connecting a server.

              `Wais::Search' will open `$Wais::maxnumfd' connections
              in parallel at most.

  Wais::Retrieve

              `Wais::Retrieve' should be called with named
              parameters (i.e. a hash). Valid parameters are
              database, host, port, docid, and type.

                      $result = Wais::Retrieve('database' => $db,
                                               'docid'    => $id, 
                                               'host'     => 'ls6',
                                               'type'     => 'TEXT');

              Defaults are the same as for `Wais::Search'. In
              addition type defaults to `'TEXT''.

  `Wais:Result'

              The functions `Wais::Search' and `Wais::Retrieve'
              return references to objects blessed into
              `Wais:Result'. The following methods are available:

    diagnostics         Returns and array of diagnostic messages. Each
                        element (if any) is a reference to an array
                        consisting of

              tag                      The tag of the corresponding
                                       search request or
                                       `'document'' if the request
                                       was a retrieve request.

              code                     The WAIS diagnostic code.

              message                  A textual diagnostic message.

    header              Returns and array of WAIS document headers. Each
                        element (if any) is a reference to an array
                        consisting of

              tag                      The tag of the corresponding
                                       search request or
                                       `'document'' if the request
                                       was a retrieve request.

              score
              lines                    Length of the corresponding
                                       dcoument in lines.

              length                   Length of the corresponding
                                       document in bytes.

              headline
              types                    A reference to an array of types
                                       valid for docid.

              docid                    A reference to the WAIS
                                       identifier blessed into
                                       `Wais::Docid'.

    text                Returns the text fetched by `Wais::Retrieve'.

Dictionary
              There are a couple of functions to inspect local
              databases. See the inspect script in the distribution.
              You need the Curses module to run it. Also adapt the
              directory settings in the top part.

  Wais::dictionary

                     %frequency = Wais::dictionary($database);
                     %frequency = Wais::dictionary($database, $field);
                     %frequency = Wais::dictionary($database, 'foo*');
                     %frequency = Wais::dictionary($database,  $field, 'foo*');

              The function returns an array containing alternating
              the matching words in the global or field dictionary
              matching the prefix if given and the freqence of the
              preceding word. In a sclar context, the number of
              matching word is returned.

  Wais::list_offset

              The function takes the same arguments as
              Wais::dictionary. It returns the same array rsp.
              wordcount with the word frequencies replaced by the
              offset of the postinglist in the inverted file.

  Wais::postings

                     %postings = Wais::postings($database, 'foo');
                     %postings = Wais::postings($database, $field, 'foo');

              Returns and an array containing alternating numeric
              document id's and a reference to an array whichs first
              element is the internal weight if the word with
              respect to the document. The other elements are the
              word/character positions of the occurances of the word
              in the document. If freeWAIS-sf is compiled with `-
              DPROXIMITY', word positions are returned otherwise
              character postitions.

              In an scalar context the number of occurances of the
              word is returned.

  Wais::headline

                     $headline = Wais::headline($database, $docid);

              The function retrieves the headline (only the text!)
              of the document numbered `$docid'.

  Wais::document

                     $text = &Wais::document($database, $docid);

              The function retrieves the text of the document
              numbered `$docid'.

Protocol
  Wais::generate_search_apdu

                     $apdu = Wais::generate_search_apdu($query,$database);
                     $relevant = [$id1, 'TEXT', $id2, 'HTML'];
                     $apdu = Wais::generate_search_apdu($query,$database,$relevant);

              Document id's must be of type `WAIS::Docid' as
              returned by `Wais::Result::header' or
              Wais::Search::header. $WAIS::maxdoc may be set to
              modify the number of documents to retrieve.

  Wais::generate_retrieval_apdu

                     $apdu = Wais::generate_retrieval_apdu($database, $docid, $type);
                     $apdu = Wais::generate_retrieval_apdu($database, $docid, 
                                                           $type, $chunk);

              Request to send the `$chunk''s chunk of the document
              whichs id is `$docid' (must be of type `WAIS::Docid').
              $chunk defaults to `0'. $Wais::CHARS_PER_PAGE may be
              set to influence the chunk size.

  Wais::local_answer

                     $answer = Wais::local_answer($apdu);

              Answer the request by local search/retrieval. The
              message header is stripped from the result for
              convenience (see the code of `Wais::Search' rsp.
              documentaion of Wais::Search::new below).

  Wais::Search::new

                     $result = Wais::Search::new($message);

              Turn the result message in an object of type
              `Wais::Search'. The following methods are available:
              diagnostics, header, and text. Result of the message
              is pretty the same as for `Wais::Result'. Just the
              tags are missing.

  Wais::Docid::new

                     $result = new Wais::Docid($distserver, $distdb, $distid,
                                   $copyright,  $origserver, $origdb, $origid);

              Only the first four arguments are manatory.

  Wais::Docid::split

                     ($distserver, $distdb, $distid, $copyright, $origserver, 
                      $origdb, $origid) = Wais::Docid::split($result);
                     ($distserver, $distdb, $distid) = Wais::Docid::split($result);
                     ($distserver, $distdb, $distid) = $result->split;

              The inverse of `Wais::Docid::new' =over 10

    diagnostics
              Return an array of references to `[$code, $message]'

    header    Return an array of references to `[$score, $lines,
              $length, $headline, $types, $docid]'.

    text      Returns the chunk of the document requested. For documents
              larger than $Wais::CHARS_PER_PAGE more than one
              request must be send.

  Wais::Search::DESTROY

    The objects will be destroyed by Perl.

VARIABLES
    $Wais::version
              Generated by: `sprintf(buf, "Wais %3.1f%d", VERSION,
              PATCHLEVEL);'

    $Wais:errmsg
              Set to an verbose error message if something went
              wrong. Most functions return `undef' on failure after
              setting `$Wais:errmsg'.

    $Wais::maxdoc
              Maximum number of hits to return when searching.
              Defaults to `40'.

    $Wais::CHARS_PER_PAGE
              Maximum number of bytes to retrieve in a single
              retrieve request. `Wais:Retrieve' sends multiple
              requests if necessary to retrieve a document.
              `CHARS_PER_PAGE' defaults to `4096'.

    $Wais::timeout
              Number of seconds to wait for an answer from remote
              servers. Defaults to 120.

    $Wais::maxnumfd
              Maximum number of file descriptors to use
              simultaneously in `Wais::Search'. Defaults to `10'.

BUGS
    `Wais::Search' currently splits the request in groups of
    `$Wais::maxnumfd' requests. Since some requests of the group
    might be local and/or some might refer to the same host/port,
    groups may not use all `$Wais::maxnumfd' possible file
    descriptors. Therefore some performance my be lost when more
    than `$Wais::maxnumfd' requests are processed.
