Config::DotNetXML
=================

## Introduction

This module provides a configuration facility similiar to that provided by
the .NET Framework inasmuch as it will read an XML file with the name
of $0.config of the format:


	<configuration>
		<appSettings>
			<add key="Foo" value="Bar" />
		</appSettings>
	</configuration>

and will by default populate the hash %appSettings with the keys specified
by the <add /> elements.  For more information see the POD documentation.

This may or may not be useful to you as it is limited to a one dimensional
configuration structure - but it was born out of a requirement to share a
configuration between Perl and C# programs.

## Prerequisites

This module requires XML::XPath to operate.  This is a change from the initial
release that implemented its own Parser using XML::Parser.

## Installation

Install the module by executing the following in the directory where you have
unpacked the module distribution:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install

You may need to use a different program than make on various different OS.

You will need to run the last step as a user with sufficient permissions to
create files in the Perl library directories - if you require the module to
be installed in an alternative location then you should run the first step as:

	perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/my/library/directory

You will need to then specify the appropriate location with :

	use lib '/my/library/directory';


## BUGS

It might be considered a bug that the hash %appSettings will be stomped on.

## SUPPORT

All bug reports and patches should be made via Github https://github.com/jonathanstowe/Config-DotNetXML
