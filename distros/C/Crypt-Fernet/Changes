  - Add Crypt::Rijndael to [Prereqs/TestPrereqs] as it wasn't 
    picked up by Dist::Zilla automatically and its absence
    causes build builures on CPANTs.

  - update lib/Crypt/Fernet.pm
	  do not pass "blocksize" to &Crypt::CBC::new because:
	  (a) it is not an option recognised by Crypt::CBC, and it
	      complains, resulting in failure to test and install.
	  (b) Crypt::CBC is able to determine the blocksize, which
	      is confirmed to be 16 for this cipher.
	- Added a Dist::Zilla dist.ini file so that a distribution
	  can be generated containing machine-readable dependency
	  declaration.
