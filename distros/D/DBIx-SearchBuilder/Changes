Revision history for Perl extension DBIx::SearchBuilder.

1.67
 - Add ->QueryHint and ->QueryHintFormatted to collection API for Oracle

1.66
 - No changes since 1.65_02

1.65_02
 - Stop unilaterally disabling the "UTF8" flag before executing queries
 - Make ->Fields case-sensitive in the column names it returns, as well
   as in the table name it takes.

1.65_01
 - Make ->Fields only lookup information on the table requested, not all
   fields, for performance.  It also is now case-sensitive in table name.
 - Omit calls to ->Fields entirely for PostgreSQL 9.1 and above

1.65 2013-07-03
 - Bug fix for DateTimeInterval extraction on Pg

1.64 2013-07-01
 - No changes since 1.63_03.  Simply a non-dev release of everything since
   1.63.

1.63_03 2013-06-14
 - warn when rollback and commit are mixed
 - Handle->NullsOrder
 - skip timezone tests on SQLite when tzinfo is not there
 - skip tests if mysql can not do timezones
 - DISTINCT argument in Join method
 - DISTINCT argument in Join and NewAlias
 - Reset the iterator position whenever a search is run
 - Return the correct record from ->Last instead of the first record
 - Document the caveat of using GotoItem with a non-zero N

1.63_02 2013-04-17
 - _Set now can take undef as argument to mean default or NULL. Still may
   result in error if default is not defined and no_nulls is true for the
   column. If old behaviour is required set $record->{'no_undefs_in_set'}
   to true value.
 - FUNCTION argument is now allowed in Limit. Code to combine FUNCTION,
   ALIAS and FIELD was refactored and unified in one place -
   CombineFunctionWithField method. Used in Column, GroupBy and Limit. This
   change should be backwards compatible.
 - Handle->DateTimeIntervalFunction

1.63_01 2013-03-27
 - IN and NOT IN operators in ->Limit method
 - Add an AdditionalColumn method to collections
 - Add an AS parameter to Column method in collections
 - Consistent query generation by sorting hash keys/values

1.63 2012-09-14
 - joins_are_distinct hint to indicate that distinct is not required for
   the current set of joins.

1.62 2012-03-26
 - Bind values were ignored in SimpleUpdateFromSelect

1.61 2011-09-16
 - New methods in Handle for mass changes from select statements:
   InsertFromSelect, DeleteFromSelect and SimpleUpdateFromSelect
 - New methods in Handle for generation of date time related SQL

1.60 2011-09-15
 - custom BuildDSN for Oracle
 - Database is treated as SID if SID is not provided
 - Build 'dbi:Oracle:<SID>' instead of 'dbi:Oracle:sid=<SID>'
 - changes in DBIx::SearchBuilder->Column method
 - complete documentation
 - support for empty FIELD argument
 - column naming fix when explicit ALIAS => 'main' passed

1.59 2010-11-19
 - DBIx::SearchBuilder->DistinctFieldValues method

1.58 2010-10-20
 - SIGNATURE fix
 - delete obsolete cvs metadata from a module

1.57 2010-09-04
 - INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: NextPage and PrevPage were adding rows from the
   previous page. Jesse claims that when he wrote this code, he  was 20
   years old and it seemed like a good idea at the time.
 - When logging queries, include full stack trace
 - support $sb->NewAlias( 'table' => 'LEFT' );
 - allow join to depend on nothing
 - catch cases when there are more closing parens then should be
 - Oracle: Use ROW_NUMBER() to propagate row ordering from inside the
   DISTINCT
 - Various performance improvements through small internal refactorings
 - Implemented 'sub Fields' on Oracle
 - unify case insensitive characters to avoid using LOWER() in some cases
 - We now RedoSearch when RowsPerPage is changed
 - No longer RedoSearch if FirstRow is called, but is not actually changed
 - Document all paging functions and test them
 - handle LOWER() in redundant LEFT joins optimizer, for Oracle and may be
   Pg
 - Make debugging problems easier by passing errors back
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=55203
 - fix Record->PrimaryKeys, field names in values hash are lc'ed
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=18280
 - doc updates and cleanups

1.56 2009-07-17
 - Don't use LOWER/ILIKE with dates, heuristic is used, but shouldn't harm
   other things
 - Don't apply DISTINCT on queries with group by, COUNT(DISTINCT x) is
   different and covered in Column method

1.55 2009-05-07
 - Put test suite SQLite databases inside of tempdirs so they get garbage
   collected properly. Thanks to Andreas Koenig [rt.cpan.org #41322]
 - Allow ->Join to pre-existing collection object
 - Imlement and test SB::Handle::Fields
 - Pg can not guaranty order in the following queries: SELECT ... FROM
   (SELECT... ORDER BY ...) we use them to build distinct sets with
   ordering by columns in joined tables. Switched to group by instead of
   sub-selects.

1.54 2008-07-09
 - When aborting transactions, we need to flush our cache, because SQLite
   is reusing the primary id for later inserts and the cache can otherwise
   become inconsistent.

1.53 2008-04-02
 - Fix mysql version check in DistinctQuery function
 - Fix order by outer column on Oracle
 - Improve tests

1.52 2008-04-01
 - Fix order by outer column on SQLite, mysql, adjust Pg. Add test that
   cover this.

1.51 2008-01-15
 - Fix CountAll method when paging is enabled and data is in memory already

1.50 2007-11-23
 - Oracle: Don't DISTINCT query when there is a group by clause
 - Fix a problem when we have more then two collections in a union and some
   of them are empty

1.49 2007-07-07
 - Fix a CPAN signature issue

1.48 2007-03-11
 - Fix a problem when left joins optimizer fails to calculate a boolean
   expression because of lower case aggregators.

1.47 2007-03-04
 - Do the search in unions only when we must do them, not on every call to
   the Next method
 - Don't index ex/ dir to avoid complains by the indexer of PAUSE/CPAN

1.46 2007-02-25
 - when doing a union, we need to actually search, rather than just doing a
   count
 - add support for testing with Oracle backend
 - Use CROSS JOIN instead of ',' as SQL parsers in Pg and some mysql are
   buggy and cannot parse "FROM X, Y JOIN Z ON Z.f = X.f"
 - deprecate DEBUG method, it's still there but produce warning
 - fix CleanSlate method that was missing several keys
 - fix a long standing bug we had, we didn't write depends_on data about a
   join, so we could build queries with incorrect parens around join
   conditions
 - fix default values for ALIAS1 argument in the Join method, istead of
   defaulting FIELD1 to 'main' value
 - fix a TODO test
 - internal refactoring of a storage for query's conditions, instead of
   building query strings right after the limit or join, we now build a
   perl structure
 - don't clone attributes that don't exists in the Clone method
 - we use Encode module without perl version check for a long time, so we
   can get rid of all checks for the version and load the module at compile
   time everywhere we need it
 - implement MayBeNull method in the handler that checks if applied
   conditions allow NULLs in the result set
 - implement cascaded LEFT JOINs optimization
 - additional tests for CleanSlate and Clone methods, ENTRY_AGGREGATOR
   argument, different types of joins and LEFT JOIN optimizer

1.45 2006-09-26

 - Doc fixes and OrderBy cleanup from ruslan

1.34 2005-11-02
 - Clone support from Ruslan

1.33 2005-09-22
 - Better SQL statement logging from alex

1.32 2005-09-01
 - DBD::SQLite is necessary for the test suite to run correctl

1.31 2005-07-29
 - Updated MANIFEST to fix a build issue -  Thanks to Andy Lester and David
   Glasser

1.30_03 2005-06-09
 - Significant new tests from Ruslan Zakirov and Dave Glasser
 - You no longer need to explicitly bless a DBIx::SearchBuilder::Handle
   subclass
 - Start of a major overhaul of the subclass API for
   DBIx::SearchBuilder::Record objects. A new "schema" method will define
   the data in _ClassAccessible and also generate database schema using
   DBIx::DBSchema.
 - for numeric types, make the empty check be "null or 0", not "null or ''"
 - New search tests from ruslan
 - added an init_data method to t/utils.pl
 - CleanSlate doesnt init show_rows
 - CleanSlate doesnt clean _{open|close}_parens
 - get rid of stupid ifs in CleanSlate
 - get rid of evals in _DoSearch and _DoCount, use Handle methods to
   control DBI error handling
 - rewrite LoadByPrimaryKeys args handling to consistent with other Load*
   methods
 - report error when PK filed is missing in LoadByPrimaryKeys
 - fix warning in __Set methods when newvalue is undef
 - small code cleanups
 - test coverage grows from 75.2% to 84.7% for Record.pm

1.30_02 2005-05-22
 - Lots of patches from Ruslan: First and main change is using of `goto
   &$AUTOLOAD` syntax, that helps avoid code duplication and hides AUTOLOAD
   sub from stack trace. I think  this also would help implement
   CompileAllAutoSubs method easier.
 - It's also one of the steps to better tests coverage.
 - Test coverage for Record.pm grows from 66% to 75.2%.
 - _LoadFromSQL never reported error when PK fields are missed. Fixed.
 - fetchrow_hashref dies only when RaiseErrors is true, because we can
   control this from Handle obj so we should die according to
   $Handle->RaiseErrors property. Fixed.
 - When RaiseErrors is "false" then fetchrow_hashref returns undef and we
   should check $sth->err(see `perldoc DBI`). Fixed.
 - After call to fetchrow we should clean "fetched" internal hash and fill
   it only when we return successful result. Fixed.
 - If SimpleQuery fails, _LoadFromSQL method doesn't return any error
   message. Fixed.

1.30_01 2005-05-16
 - Patches from Ruslan to switch to using 'capitalization.pm' for our
   regular_case subroutine aliases

1.30 2005-07-28
 - Removed {{{ and  }}} fold markers. Patch from Ruslan

1.27 2005-05-08
 - Added supoprt for functions containing "?" to represent the parameter in
   ->Column()
 - Added better support for functional columns in search listings and group
   by clauses

1.26 2005-04-17
 - Added support for expression based left joins

1.25 2005-04-09
 - Backed out a change introduced in 1.23 that caused table and column
   names to be quoted, causing Postgres to flip out.

1.24 2005-04-06
 - Added a new "SearchBuilder::Unique" module for uniquifying search
   results

1.23
 - Now use DBI->quote_identifier to quote column and table names (Ruslan)
 - Test suite updates (Ruslan)

1.22 2005-01-24
 - Require encode since we require encode.

1.21 2005-01-22
 - Oracle LOB handling caused us to corrupt item values on update.
 - Just before inserting things into the database, turn off their utf8
   flag. The flag didn't have any positve impact _and_ it can take down
   recent DBD::Oracle releases. (This is a new failure in DBD::Oracle 1.16)

1.20 2005-01-18
 - Minor test suite fixes from Ruslan.

1.19 2005-01-08
 - Performing a search multiple times could result in multiple copies of
   records in a collection. Uncovered thanks to Kevin Chen and Alex
   Vandiver.

1.18
 - Release the changes from 1.17

1.17_03
 - Properly mark BLOB columns in UPDATE calls. (DBD::Oracle 1.16 broke
   without this)

1.17_02
 - Better handling of empty values for SB::Record::_Accessible. ( --Ruslan)

1.17_01
 - More record tests from Ruz

1.16 2004-12-09
 - Fixed a bug in D::SB::R::Cachable that could cause it to load the wrong
   row from the cache if you were loading by alternate keys and had since
   changed one of the attributes of a previous row.  This was unmasked by a
   bug that Ruslan Zakirov found in RT 3.3's custom field handling

1.15 2004-11-27
 - Fix a testsuite bug when DBD::SQLite isn't there

1.14
 - Silenced warnings about uninitialized warnings when inserting null cols
   into the database.
 - Started adding lowercase method name aliases
 - Minor refactoring of 'id' method for a stupid, tiny perf improvement
 - Refactoring of DBIx::SearchBuilder::Record::Cachable for performance
   improvement
 - Added a FlushCache method to DBIx::SearchBuilder::Record::Cachable.
 - Started to flesh out a...test suite
 - SearchBuilder now truncates strings before inserting them into character
   types in the database as mysql generally does. Additionally, it
   truncates things at utf8 character boundaries...as mysql does not.
 - Fix for an undefined record cache warning on load from Autrijus Tang
 - Major documentation cleanups --Simon Cavalletto
 - A few tweaks to the ::Record class to eliminate the hard-coding of the
   name of the id column --Simon Cavalletto

1.12
 - Better error handling for some query build failure cases
 - Corrected query builder for SQLite
 - More refactoring.

1.11
 - When loading an object whose "id" has been altered, as in the case of
   RT's "Merge" functionality, the wrong object was returned by the caching
   layer. Special casing for the "id" method was removed.

1.10_05
 - Reworked the _Accessible mechanism in DBIx::SearchBuilder::Record to
   remove a horribly crufty old caching mechanism that created a copy of
   the accessible hash for each and every object instantiated, sometimes
   quite slowly.

1.10_04 2004-08-30
 - A query builder fix for an issue that bit RT2: Unsatisfied dependency
   chain in Joins Users_2 at
   /usr/local/share/perl/5.8.3/DBIx/SearchBuilder/Handle.pm line 965,  line
   69.

1.10_03 2004-08-30
 - Cache Sanity fixes from Autrijus Tang <autrijus@autrijus.org>

1.10_02 2004-08-26

1.10_01 2004-08-26
 - Reimplemented DBIx::SearchBuilder:::Record::Cachable to use
   Cache::Simple::TimedExpiry. This should make it faster and more memory
   efficient.

1.10
 - Identical to 1.10_05

1.02_03 2004-07-22
 - Additional bullet proofing for joins. Now we default to ALIAS1 being
   "main"  (cubic@acronis.ru)

1.02_02 2004-07-20
 - Fixed a join bug that mostly manifests as a 'Dependency chain' error on
   RT2.

1.02_01 2004-07-07
 - magic _Object instantiation from cubic@acronis.ru
 - make SB::_Handle settable directly  (cubic@acronis.ru)
 - document the above

1.01 2004-06-27
 - Releasing 1.00_06 as stable

1.00_06
 - Pg/Oracle: Don't attempt to do case insensitive comparisons on integer
   values.

1.00_05
 - Force utf8 flag on when doing searches for utf8 data; this is a
   workaround for DBDs that don't do it themselves.

1.00_04
 - Move Postgres specific join behaviour to the superclass so everyone gets
   the benefit.

1.00_03
 - Remove "AS" from table name aliases on joins, since Oracle doesn't like
   em.
