- Document the API Apache::Session expects you to implement for new                 
  stores, lockers, serializers, and generators.                                     
- Make interfaces more abstract so using a tied hash is not the only                
  easily accessible option.                                                         
- Review and expand test coverage as much as possible (anybody have                 
  a spare Sybase or Oracle?).                                                       
- Address anything at                                                               
  http://rt.cpan.org/NoAuth/Bugs.html?Dist=Apache-Session                           
- Address anything in http://cpanratings.perl.org/d/Apache-Session                  
  appropriately.                                                                    
- Review and apply suggestions and patches from contributors.                       
- Form a secret cabal to get the cpanrating up to 4.5 stars.                        
- Work with any testing monkeys that the Phalanx project brings me,                 
  http://qa.perl.org/phalanx/distros.html                                           
- Always precede a release with as many dev releases as necessary                   
  (is this getting too detailed?).                                                  
- Generally treat the distribution with great care because it is                    
  widely used.
