- errno 9 (Bad file descriptor) was the result on these pids: 0
  from: http://www.cpantesters.org/cpan/report/6530781
  how do we handle this? we should throw an error if its an illegal pid?
  ... also read more cpants results from 1.00 and look for anything suspect
- pull CFLAGS from environment if they exist?
- should eval { require warnings; }; be inside BEGIN?
- it'd be nice if we could emit a custom error message if make fails
  ie, "try setting cc or cflags explicitly via Makefile.PL arguments"
  perhaps use a bin/cc-exec.pl that calls system cc using $ENV{PATH} 
  and emits that message if cc failed? note: system's behavior wrt
  failing commands is weird -- be careful
- check if this works with perl <5.5 (all the way back to 5.0 might work
  except that Config came around in 5.3). then set META.yml as well as 
  Makefile.PL to the version we really want: use 5.005 or whatever.
  see http://wiki.cpantesters.org/wiki/CPANAuthorNotes for Makefile.PL info
- migrate to Module::Build
- add activeperl/win32 to the stuff we test? (is there free msvc stuff?)
- it's time for a better api...
- VMS: PIDs can be hex(?) e.g. 2341B053.
  see VMS::Process and see how they do things... perldoc perlvms too...

- there must be some way to do a windows/pure perl implementation...
  see if there is a pureperl win possibility via Win32.pm or
  Win32::Process. Win32::API is probably the best bet, as we can
  just sort of port the XS code over into perl-land, but it'll never
  be as good as XS. it also might be a win just to pull those in if they
  exist and have something relevant, for people who use activeperl and 
  don't have a functional cc setup, for example.
- unify _{scalar|list}_pexists into one XS sub
- get rid of the pureperl parts of the xs pexists sub
- win32: use a process snapshot when we ask about a lot of PIDs,
  heuristically choose at runtime which code to run based on #pids

for better test coverage of pureperl stuff via cpants, make a test 
script that (for information purposes only) runs pureperl tests
seperately? this would break win32/{strawberry|activeperl}, so we'd have 
to check $^O and skip in that case...
