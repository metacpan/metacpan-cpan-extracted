Devel::Mallinfo is an interface to the C library mallinfo() function
giving malloc memory allocation statistics.  This is meant for
development use, to give an idea of how much space your program and
any libraries are using from malloc().

The only prerequisite is a C compiler for the XS, and Perl version
5.6 or higher (or a backport of warnings.pm).  The Devel::Mallinfo
