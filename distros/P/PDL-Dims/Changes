Revision history for PDL-Dims
0.013	2015-10-1

	* fixed ncop: if 1st argument had a dim with size 1, this was propagated
	  regardless of the 2nd argument's respective dimsize(). Also a subtest was added.

	* sln produced a lot of warnings by passing undefined to PDL. added +0 to suppress that.

0.012	2015-9-2

	* improved handling of scalars in nop, ncop

	* fixed a bug for 1-element piddles in initdim (dmax calculation was off)

	2015-1-27

	* pos2i now is certain to return a valid index

0.011	2014-11-25

	* copy_dim now works for all dims at once when no dim is supplied.

	2014-11-20
	
	* nreduce is now lvalue sub

0.010	2014-10-10

	* sln and active_slice are now declared as lvalue subroutines, allowing assignment - 
	  Thanks to David Martens!

0.009	2014-10-8

	* sln: dmax was often wrong, fixed

0.008 	2014-10-3

	* ncop: fixed logic when 1st arg was a scalar

	* nop: now can be called without dimension, it then works on the first.

	* ->can() was not always encaplsulated in eval{ }, causing some unexpected crashes.

	2014-9-30

	* ncop can handle cases with non-piddle arguments better now, e.g. mutliply by scalar



0.007 	2014-9-26

	* index could be out of bounds in sln, fixed?


0.006	2014-4-9

	* fixed: initdim dropped last dim when inserting dim at pos < ndims

	* added diminfo, extended PDL::info
	
0.005002 
	2014-3-17

	* fixed pod-coverage.t test failure by removing -T switch.

0.005001 2014-3-14
	
	* changelog updates

	* documentation updates

0.005	2014-3-14

	* pos2i was faulty for evenly-spaced values

0.004	2014-2-24

	* added a dummy=> option to initdim

	* fixes and improvements in nagg

	* ncop now can handle scalars (converts them to 1-element piddles)

	* documentation update

0.003	2014-2-21

	* added a function for sanity check

	* native aggregate function support

	* fixes to copy_dim/initdim - hash keys are now the same as expected arguments
	
	* added a spacing function

	* cleanup of min/max/inc/vals - either you have equal spacing (spacing ==1) with inc 
	or vals, never both

	* support for non-evenly spaced and non-numeric dims 

	* davg name clash - going away

	* internal routine _fix_old for converting old data

	* many fixes

0.002 	2014-2-17


	* many fixes in ncop,nreduce,nop,sln

	* added nsqueeze - updating (removing) dims when squeezing

	* added active_slice - returns selected (as in call to idx) slice, ignores list of dims

0.001_001 2014-2-17
	* fixed nop


0.001   2014-2-13 
        First version, released on an unsuspecting world.
