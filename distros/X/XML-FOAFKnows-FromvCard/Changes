Revision history for Perl extension XML::FOAFKnows::FromvCard.

0.6   2005-11-19 23:46
        - Fixed a spec violation (duh!) bug, I had used uri instead of
	  url.


0.51  2005-10-20 00:25
        - Previous release did not pass tests, so, fixed that bug.
	- Added another 6 UTF8-related tests.
	
0.5   2005-10-12 23:00
	- Punycode-encode nodeIDs, to support nicks that have non-ASCII
	  characters.
	- Document that people will have to ensure that their input is
	  UTF-8.
	- foafvcard attempts to decode the data to ensure that it is
	  UTF-8, as is required above.
	- I think these UTF-8 changes makes it depend on 5.7.3.
	- Handle no data more gracefully.

0.4   2005-09-18 00:50
	- More privacy features.
	- More documentation, especially about privacy issues.
	- Many more tests.
	- Added a dependency to the most recent Text::vCard since previous
	  versions had seqfault issues.
	- URLs will be added even for non-public data, but not with title.
	- Thanks to Libby Miller for sharing her vCards and for testing. :-)
	
0.3   2005-09-17 00:20
	- New tests.
	- Will install the foafvcard script appropriately and make it more 
	  usable.
	- A little more documentation.
	
0.2   2005-08-30 01:00
	- Renamed it since it isn't really a Formatter, even though it
	  conforms to the specification. Thanks to Tom Insam for
	  discussion.
	- Implemented a more thorough scheme for identifying the Person
	  behind the knows. Thanks to Jim Ley.
	- Added a simple person count as nodeID if there is no nick.
