0.11  Thu Feb 16 22:16:02 UTC 2012
    - Added missing semicolons to XS statements.
    - Added ppport request to provide sv_2pv_flags function for Perl 5.6.2.

0.10  Wed Feb  8 07:17:17 UTC 2012
    - Switched away from undocumented SvPVx_nolen, for compatiblity with

0.09  Tue Feb  7 14:51:37 UTC 2012
    - my_strlcat is also needed for Perl < 5.8.9.

0.08  Wed Feb  1 20:14:03 UTC 2012
    - Added support for Perls < 5.8.9 by explicitly requesting ppport to

0.07  Tue Jan 24 20:38:39 UTC 2012
    - Adjusted synopsis and tests to allow for the fact that posix_spawn can
      return successfully even if the spawned command fails.

0.06  Tue Jan 24 02:29:17 UTC 2012
    - Fixed inconsistent test results by also checking spawned pid against

      about creating subshells.
