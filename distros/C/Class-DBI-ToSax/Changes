Revision history for Perl extension Class::DBI::ToSax.

0.10	Tue Oct 14 15:14:04 BST 2003
	- Add coderef support to norecurse.
	- Much improved tests for norecurse support.
	- Don't propogate forced wrapper names down to has_many
	  elements.

0.09	Wed Jul 16 17:13:24 BST 2003
	- Bring up to date with Class::DBI 0.93 and multi column primary
	  keys.

0.08	Thu Jun  5 15:21:22 BST 2003
	- Prevent recursion using table name not class name.  This
	  helps if you've inherited from your Class::DBI objects in
	  weird ways like I did...

0.07	Wed Jun  4 10:49:21 BST 2003
	- Add notoplevel flag, to let this be used as part of a bigger
	  SAX generator.

0.06	Thu Apr 24 14:10:50 BST 2003
	- Enable Module::Build.

0.05	Sat Apr 12 22:38:20 BST 2003
	- [BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE]
	  When outputting a has_a() relation, use the column name
	  instead of the element name.
	- [RT#2362] [BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE]
	  Change the way that we detect has_a() relationships to work
	  consistently, even when there is nothing there.
	- Actually test the XML output.  This means that we depend on a
	  few more modules now, hopefully nothing too onerous.

0.04    Tue Apr  1 13:07:55 BST 2003
        - Expand norecurse option to take a hash ref.

0.03	Sun Mar 30 14:28:23 BST 2003
	- Call start/end_document() ourselves
	- Make the recursion defense barrier a bit better.
	- Add in optional norecurse to to_sax().

0.02	Fri Mar 28 15:32:12 GMT 2003
	- Send out the full range of SAX fields in start/end_element().

0.01  Wed Mar 26 13:14:20 2003
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.22 with options
		-AX -n Class::DBI::ToSax -b 5.6.1
