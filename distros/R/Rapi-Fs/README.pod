=head1 NAME

Rapi::Fs - Plack-compatible, instant ExtJS file browser

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Rapi::Fs;
 
 my $app = Rapi::Fs->new({
   mounts  => [ '/some/path', '/foo/blah' ]
 });

 # Plack/PSGI app:
 $app->to_app

Or, using L<rapi-fs.pl> utility script:

 rapi-fs.pl /some/path /foo/blah

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a L<Plack>-compatible file browser application written using L<RapidApp>. It generates a 
nice-looking dynamic web interface to browse and view arbitrary files and directories for the 
configured "mounts" using a standard, split-panel tree layout:

For a live demo, see: L<rapi.io/fs|http://rapi.io/fs>

Internally, the RapidApp module class L<Rapi::Fs::Module::FileTree> does the heavy lifting, and that
module can be configured and used directly within an existing RapidApp.

The convenience utility script L<rapi-fs.pl> is also available, which is a simple wrapper around this
module, to be able to fire up a fully working and self-contained app on-the-fly (including launching a
built-in webserver) from the command-line.

=head1 CONFIGURATION

C<Rapi::Fs> extends L<RapidApp::Builder> and supports all of its options, as well as the following
params specific to this module:

=head2 mounts

List of directory "mount" points to use/show in the application. This is the only required parameter
and supports a flexible syntax. Mounts can be supplied as simple directory string paths, HashRef configs,
or "driver" objects (consuming the L<Rapi::Fs::Role::Driver> role). The default driver class which 
ships with the C<Rapi::Fs> package is L<Rapi::Fs::Driver::Filesystem>.

The following mount specifications are all equivalent:

 $app = Rapi::Fs->new({
   mounts  => [ '/some/path' ]
 });

 $app = Rapi::Fs->new({
   mounts  => [{
     driver => 'Filesystem',
     name   => 'path',
     args   => '/some/path'
   }]
 });

 $app = Rapi::Fs->new({
   mounts  => [ 
     Rapi::Fs::Driver::Filesystem->new({
       name   => 'path',
       args   => '/some/path'
     })
   ]
 });

When using the HashRef syntax, the C<'driver'> param is a class name relative to the 
C<Rapi::Fs::Driver::*> namespace. To supply a full class name, prefix with C<'+'>, for instance:

 $app = Rapi::Fs->new({
   mounts  => [{
     driver => '+My::Fs::Driver',
     name   => 'Foobar',
     args   => 'something understood by My::Fs::Driver'
   }]
 });

Different forms can also be mix/matched:

 $app = Rapi::Fs->new({
   mounts  => [
     {
       driver => '+My::Fs::Driver',
       name   => 'Foobar',
       args   => 'something understood by My::Fs::Driver'
     },
     '/path/to/something',
     {
       name  => 'perl5-lib',
       args  => '/usr/lib/perl5'
     },
     Some::Other::Driver->new({
       name   => 'larry',
       args   => 'bla',
       foo    => 'bar'
     })
   ]
 });

L<Rapi::Fs::Driver::Filesystem> is the only driver which has been implemented so far, but this module
was written with the idea of implementing other drivers in mind, both as possible additional 
core-modules as well as user-defined drivers. See L<Rapi::Fs::Role::Driver> for more info on the 
driver API.

=head2 filetree_class

Defaults to L<Rapi::Fs::Module::FileTree>.

=head2 filetree_params

Optional extra params to supply to the C<filetree_class> constructor.
