    Properly escapes curly brackets in regex (RT#117496)
    Thanks to srezic for the bug report.
    [Removes warnings on perl 5.22. Upgrade recommended if using 5.22 or later.]

    Bug fix release: close tcp sessions upon subsequent requests (RT#56119)

    Fixed a bug in which tcp sessions were remaining open. The js
    client would reload every 1.5s and eventually we would use up
    all the tcp ports.

    Made the js a bit more robust. Should deal with terminated
    plack servers much more reliably--ie, continue to try to reload.
