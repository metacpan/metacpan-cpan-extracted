NAME

Authen::DecHpwd - DEC VMS password hashing

DESCRIPTION

This module implements the SYS$HASH_PASSWORD password hashing function
from VMS (also known as LGI$HPWD), and some associated VMS username and
password handling functions.

The password hashing function is implemented in XS, with a hideously
slow pure Perl backup version for systems that can't handle XS.

INSTALLATION

	perl Build.PL
	./Build
	./Build test
	./Build install

AUTHOR

The original C implementation of LGI$HPWD was written by Shawn Clifford.
The code has since been developed by Davide Casale, Mario Ambrogetti,
Terence Lee, Jean-loup Gailly, Solar Designer, and Andrew Main (Zefram).

Mike McCauley <mikem@open.com.au> created the first version of
"Authen::DecHpwd", establishing the Perl interface.  This was based on
Shawn Clifford's code without the later developments.

Andrew Main (Zefram) <zefram@fysh.org> created a new "Authen::DecHpwd"
based on the more developed C code presently used, and added ancillary
functions.
