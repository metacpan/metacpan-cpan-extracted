Net::LibNIDS version 0.14
=========================

This module embeds the libnids C library written by Rafal Wojtczuk 
<nergal@avet.com.pl>. libnids is designed to do all lowlevel network code 
required by a network intrusion detection system (whichis what NIDS stands 
for). This module uses libnids to allow you to read the reassembled tcp stream 
without any duplicates or incorrect order. That is, like a normal host would
have seen the stream.

Note that on AMD64 architecture machines the libnids library must not be 
compiled with strict aliasing enabled.  For GCC, this means passing 
-fno-strict-aliasing if you use -O2 or above.  Alternatively compile with -O1.

Tests will fail if libnids is compiled with -O2 but this is not a bug with 
Net::LibNIDS, as no callbacks are raised by libnids.  See:
