NAME
    Unicode::Debug - debug Unicode strings

SYNOPSIS
     use Unicode::Debug;
 
     print unidebug("Héllò Wörld"), "\n";

DESCRIPTION
    Makes non-ASCII/non-printable characters in a string blindingly obvious.

  Functions
    `unidebug`
        This function replaces "unusual" characters in strings with a Perl
        escape sequence that will have the same effect. The example in the
        SYNOPSIS outputs this:

         H\x{00e9}ll\x{00f2} W\x{00f6}rld

        Which characters are considered unusual? Everything outside the range
        \x20 to \x7F. (The \t, \r and \n characters are handled separately.)

        To ensure that `unidebug` is reversible, backslashes in the input are
        doubled in the output.

        Called in void context, it modifies the strings passed to it in-place.
        For example, the following will output the same as the previous
        example.

          my @strings = ("Héllò", "Wörld");
          unidebug(@strings);
          say(join " ", @strings);

        Called in list context, it returns modified versions of the strings
        passed to it. Another example:

          my @strings = unidebug("Héllò", "Wörld");
          say(join " ", @strings);

        Called in scalar context, it acts the same as in list context, but
        only returns the first modified string.

    `unidecode`
        An alias for `unidebug`, to use as a drop-in replacement for
        Text::Unidecode.

  Package Variables
    OK, so global variables are perhaps not the best way to configure things,
    but we have `local` so quit complaining.

   $Unicode::Debug::Whitespace
    If set to true, debugs "\r", "\n" and "\t" as well. They are substituted
    as follows:

     "\r\n"    => "\\r\\n\n"
     "\r"      => "\\r\n"
     "\n"      => "\\n\n"
     "\t"      => "\\t"

    When false, these whitespace characters are passed through unchanged.
    False by default.

   $Unicode::Debug::Names
    If set to true, will use charnames to show character names for substituted
    characters. "Wörld" becomes:

     W\N{LATIN SMALL LETTER O WITH DIAERESIS}rld

    False by default.
