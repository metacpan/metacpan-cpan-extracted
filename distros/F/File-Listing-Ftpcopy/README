NAME

    File::Listing::Ftpcopy - parse directory listing using ftpparse from
    ftpcopy

VERSION

    version 0.09

SYNOPSIS

     # traditional interface
     use File::Listing::Ftpcopy qw(parse_dir);
     $ENV{LANG} = "C";  # dates in non-English locales not supported
     for (parse_dir(`ls -l`)) {
         ($name, $type, $size, $mtime, $mode) = @$_;
         next if $type ne 'f'; # plain file
         #...
     }
    
     # directory listing can also be read from a file
     open(LISTING, "zcat ls-lR.gz|");
     $dir = parse_dir(\*LISTING, '+0000');
    
     # ftpparse interface
     use 5.010;
     use Parse::Listing::Ftpcopy qw( ftpparse SIZE_UNKNOWN );
     
     foreach my $line (`ls -l`)
     {
       chomp $line;
       my $h = ftpparse($line);
       next unless defined $h;
       say "name : ", $h->{name}
       say "size : ", $h->{size} if $h->{sizetype} != SIZE_UNKNOWN;
     }

DESCRIPTION

    This module provides functions for parsing the output of directory
    listings of the sort generated by an FTP server. It is intended to
    provide a mostly drop in replacement for the parse_dir function from
    File::Listing (although see CAVEATS below) that uses the ftpparse
    function from ftpcopy (see URL in the SEE ALSO section below) instead
    of the Perl implementation provided by File::Listing. ftpparse is
    written in C, and so may or may not be faster, although probably
    unnoticeable unless you are parsing a recursive directory listing of a
    large system, and if you have to do that maybe you should rethink your
    approach anyway.

    Where this module may come in handy over File::Listing is that it
    understands the output from a different subset of systems. For my
    purposes, ftpparse understands VMS listings, on the other hand,
    File::Listing understands Apache listings, neither module understands
    both. If you know ahead of time which system you are going to be
    dealing with you can use either this module or File::Listing, or if you
    do not know ahead of time, you can try each and use the results from
    which ever one actually works (or works best).

    This module supports the following file listings:

      * EPLF

      * UNIX ls, with or without gid

      * Different Windows and DOS FTP servers.

      * VMS, but not CMS

      * NetPresenz (Mac)

      * NetWare

    This module also provides a direct interface to the ftpparse function
    as well.

FUNCTIONS

 parse_dir

      my $dir = parse_dir( $listing );
      my $dir = parse_dir( $listing, $time_zone );
      my $dir = parse_dir( $listing, $time_zone, $type );
      my $dir = parse_dir( $listing, $time_zone, $type, $error);

    The first argument ($listing) is the directory listing to parse. It can
    be a scalar, a reference to an array of directory lines or a glob
    representing a filehandle to read the directory listing from.

    The second argument ($time_zone) is used when parsing the time stamps
    in the listing. If the value is undefined, then the local time zone is
    assumed.

    The third argument ($type) is ignored, but included here for
    compatibility with File::Listing.

    The fourth argument ($error) specifies how unparseable lines should be
    treated. Values can be 'ignore', 'warn' or a code reference. 'warn'
    means that the perl warn function will be called. If a code reference
    is passed, then this routine will be called and the return value from
    it will be incorporated in the listing. The default is 'ignore'.

    For each file found in the listing it returns an array ref

     foreach my $fileinfo (parse_dir($listing))
     {
       ($name, $type, $size, $mtime, $mode) = @$fileinfo;
       # ...
     }

    The first element ($name) is the name of the file.

    The second element ($size) is the size of the file.

    The third element ($mtime) is the modification time of the file.

    The forth element ($mode) is supposed to be the permission bits of the
    file, but ftpparse ignores the permission information so this is always
    undef.

    Any field which could not be determined by the algorithm will be undef.

 ftpparse

     my $hash = ftpparse( $line );

    Parse a single line from an FTP listing. Returns a hash ref of
    information about the file found in that line, or undef if no file
    information was found about the file.

    Here is the information found in the hash ref:

      * name

      The name of the file

      * size

      The size of the file

      * sizetype

      What format the size refers to, one of

	* SIZE_UNKNOWN

	The size could not be determined (size is set to 0)

	* SIZE_BINARY

	The size assumes a binary transfer (TYPE I)

	* SIZE_ASCII

	The size assumes an ASCII transfer (TYPE A)

	This is currently unused, but could theoretically be used in the
	future.

      * flagtrycwd

      0 if the file is definitely not a directory. 1 otherwise.

      * flagtryretr

      0 if the file is definitely not a regular file or symlink, which can
      be retrieved. 1 otherwise.

      * symlink

      If the file is a symlink, then this contains the target name (or at
      least part of the target name) of the symlink.

      * format

      The detected format of the listing, one of:

	* FORMAT_UNKNOWN

	* FORMAT_EPLF

	* FORMAT_MLSX

	* FORMAT_LS

      * mtime

      The modification time as the number of non-leap seconds since the
      epoch.

      * mtimetype

      Information about the mtime field, one of:

	* MTIME_UNKNOWN

	modification time is undetermined

	* MTIME_LOCAL

	time is correct for the current time zone

	* MTIME_REMOTEMINUTE

	Time zone and seconds are unknown

	* MTIME_REMOTEDAY

	Time zone and time of day are unknown

	* MTIME_REMOTESECOND

	time zone is unknown

CAVEATS

    Because ftpparse is written in C and the bindings to it are in XS, so a
    C compiler is required.

    Because ftpparse does not parse out permission information, the mode
    field is always undef.

    ftpparse uses a different algorithm, and uses a different interface
    under the covers, it recognizes a different subset of system listings,
    and may interpret them differently so this module is not, and does not
    pretend to be 100% compatible with File::Listing.

    Internally ftpparse assumes GMT if it can't determine the time zone
    from the listing, and doesn't provide an interface for specifying
    another time zone if you do happen to know what the remote server's
    time zone is. File::Listing assumes the listing is for the local time
    zone unless you specify one through the calling interface. In order to
    get the expected behavior for parse_dir, this module jumps through some
    extra hoops to support the File::Listing interface. To avoid these
    hoops use the ftpparse interface instead.

    The ftpparse function from ftpcopy is based on ftpparse by Daniel J.
    Bernsteins. Bernsteins' version is incompatible with GPL, and possibly
    other open source licenses. The ftpparse function from ftpcopy was
    written by Uwe Ohse and is mostly public domain, but there was one
    dependent C source file which was licensed under GPL 2, so I am
    licensing this whole distribution under GPL 2.
