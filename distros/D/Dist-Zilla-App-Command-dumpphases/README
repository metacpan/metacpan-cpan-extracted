Dist::Zilla::App::Command::dumpphases

Working out what Plugins will execute in which order during which phase
can be a little confusing sometimes.

This Command exists primarily to make developing Plugin Bundles and
debugging dist.ini a bit easier, especially for newbies who may not
fully understand Bundles yet.

If you want to turn colors off, use "Term::ANSIcolor"'s environment
variable "ANSI_COLORS_DISABLED". E.g:

  ANSI_COLORS_DISABLED=1 dzil dumpphases

Alternatively, since 0.3.0 you can specify a color-free theme:

    dzil dumpphases --color-theme=basic::plain
