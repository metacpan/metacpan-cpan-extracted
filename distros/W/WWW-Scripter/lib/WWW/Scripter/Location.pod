=head1 VERSION

Version 0.032

=head1 METHODS

=over

=item hash

=item host

=item hostname

=item href

=item pathname

=item port

=item protocol

=item search

Each of these returns or sets the corresponding part of the URI. (Actually,
C<href> refers to the whole thing, not just a part.) If you set one of
these, it tells the WWW::Scripter object to go to another page.

What the location object shows as being the current URL includes the
fragment (hash) if any, and can also be modified by 
C<< history->pushState >>. To get the real URL, use WWW::Scripter's C<uri>
method, which is inherited from WWW::Mechanize.

=item reload

Does what it says.

=item replace ( $new_uri )

Replaces the current page in Mech's history with C<$new_uri>, which it
tells Mech to go and fetch.
