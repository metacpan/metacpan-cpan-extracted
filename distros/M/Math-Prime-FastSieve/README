Math-Prime-FastSieve - Fast prime number utilities.

======================================

This module implements the Sieve of Eratosthenes to find all primes
up to (and including) 'n'.  The Sieve is one of the fastest means known.
This module implements it using a bit vector for memory efficiency, and
does so using C++ for speed efficiency.  The module depends on
Inline::CPP, which itself is a subclass of Inline::C.

Use this module if you need a list of prime numbers, and need it fast.
How fast?  Well at the time of writing it is the fastest solution I can
find on CPAN, including Math::Prime::XS.  And it works all the way up to
'n' of 2.14 billion (higher if your Perl was compiled with support for longs).
Because it uses a bit sieve, the result set will actually consume more memory
than the prime sieve.

This module also provides several other prime numbers related functions.

INSTALLATION

First, you need a C++ compiler that is compatible with the C compiler used to
build Perl itself.

Next, to install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

It will be necessary to have the modules described below installed prior
to attempting to install this module.  If you install it using the
cpan shell, or cpanm, or cpanplus, the dependencies should get dragged
down and installed automatically.

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules and libraries:

  Inline::MakeMaker - Used by Makefile.PL instead of ExtUtils::MakeMaker.
  Inline::CPP       - A primary dependency.
  Inline::C         - Inline::CPP is a subclass of Inline::C.
  Inline            - Inline::CPP and Inline::C plug into Inline.
  Parse::RecDescent - Used to parse the grammar.
  Test::More        - Core module, used in testing.
  English           - Core module, used in testing.
  Perl version 5.006 or later.
