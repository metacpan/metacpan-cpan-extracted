=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a small script that uses HTML::SimpleLinkExtractor to pull
all the HTML links out of the input HTML. It can take input from
files you specify on the command line (or standard input), or fetch
a URL.

=head2 Options

=over 4

=item -b=base

The C<-b> switch sets the base URL to resolve relative URLs in the
input.

=item -f=fetch_url

Instead of reading from files specified on the command line or
standard input, fetch this URL and use it as input.
