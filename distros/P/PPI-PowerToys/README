NAME
    PPI::PowerToys - A handy collection of small PPI-based utilities

DESCRIPTION
    The PPI PowerToys are a small collection of utilities for working with
    Perl files, modules and distributions.

    To kick off the collection, he's added a very simple and raw version of
    one of his own little tools.

  ppi_version
      > ppi_version show
      > ppi_version change 0.01 0.02

    ppi_version is a utility for working with version numbers in groups of
    modules.

    The "ppi_version show" command will scan through your distribution
    (starting in the current directory and working down) and locate all the
    versions for the various Perl files in the distribution.

    It scans through all files inside the current directory with one-only
    instance of the line.

      $VERSION = '0.01';

    The "ppi_version change" command scans through your distribution
    (starting in the current directory and working down) and locate all
    cases where the $VERSION is the first param, replacing it (safely) with
    the second params.

TO DO
    - Add extra commands to ppi_version

    - Include more useful utilities

    - Any improvements to the current utilities are also very welcome.
