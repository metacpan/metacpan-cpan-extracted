SHORT DESCRIPTION

This Perl module provides routines for checking validity of email
address.

It makes several checks:

1) it checks the syntax of an email address;

2) it checks if there any MX records or A records for the
   domain part of the email address;

3) it tries to connect to an email server directly via SMTP to check
   if mailbox is valid. Old versions of this module performed this
   check via the VRFY command.  Now the module uses another check; it
   uses a combination of MAIL and RCPT commands which simulates
   sending an email. It can detect bad mailboxes in many cases.

This module was designed with CGIs (or any other dynamic Web content
programmed with Perl) in mind. Usually it is required to quickly check
e-mail addresses in forms. If the check can't be finished in
reasonable time, the e-mail address should be treated as valid.

For details see pod documentation in Mail::CheckUser

REQUIREMENTS

This module requires next Perl modules:

1) Net::SMTP  (libnet package)
2) Net::DNS   (Net-DNS package)
3) IO::Handle (IO package)
4) Net::Ping  (Net-Ping package)

Perl distributions before 5.6 contain version of IO::Handle which has
bugs in timeouts handling. Download latest version from CPAN if you
haven't done it before.

INSTALLATION

perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install

Tests may run very slow especially if networking is down.
