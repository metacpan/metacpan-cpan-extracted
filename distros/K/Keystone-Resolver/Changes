Revision history for Perl extension Keystone::Resolver.

1.23  Thu May  1 10:26:03 BST 2008
	- Same as 1.22, except that it is properly date-stamped.

1.22  (IN PROGRESS)
	- Oracle back-end now fully functional and tested, both with
	  the resolver itself and the Admin UI.  See db/README for
	  instructions on making a toy Oracle resource database, and
	  the top-level README for instructions on running the
	  test-suite against this.
	- Various changes to canonicalise the order of things like
	  equal-priority results in the XML returned from
	  resolve_to_xml(), required so that the same regression-test
	  suite can be used with both MySQL and Oracle.
	- Add a test-script that invokes the actual "resolve" script.
	  The absence of this was responsible for 1.20 going out while
	  "resolve" itself was still not making its own $resolver
	  object, while the various test-scripts were.
	- It is now mandatory to pass a $resolver into
	  OpenURL::newFromCGI(), since memory problems will always
	  result if it is allowed to allocate its own.
	- Change API of OpenURL::newFromCGI() to reflect mandatory
	  $resolver and better match the default constructor, new().
	- Add Makefile.PL dependency on Scalar::Util.pm

1.21  Thu Apr 10 15:23:53 BST 2008
	- URGENT BUGFIX RELEASE: the resolve script now makes its own
	  $resolver object rather than allowing newFromCGI() to make
	  one on its behalf.  This ensures that the resolver stays
	  referenced (not only by the OpenURL's weak reference) until
	  the resolution is complete.

1.20  Thu Apr 10 12:36:28 BST 2008
	- Changes to memory management: since the Resolver, Database,
	  OpenURL and  ContextObject classes all contain references
	  back and forth, the next of mutually referencing objects was
	  not getting destructed when it went out of scope, leading to
	  memory exhaustion in long-running processes such as Apache
	  servers under heavy load.  That is now fixed through the use
	  of weak references back to the "owning" objects.  Tests show
	  that resolving 50,000 OpenURLs does not cause noticable
	  process growth.
	- Changes to regression-test suite to facilitate running when
	  not connected to network.
	- Added new test script, admin.t, testing the code that
	  underlies the web-based admin interface.
	- Refactored database-access code in Database.pm, greatly
	  reducing the number of similar functions and unifying
	  logging.
	- Add support for the Serial Alias object type, both in the
	  code and in the Admin web UI.  (Admin support for this is
	  not very useful yet, since, as with other kinds of link,
	  there is no way to maintain the links between an alias
	  object and the serial that it is an alias of.)
	- Added low-level object-API support for the service-to-serial
	  and genre-to-servicetype link tables.  (There's no point in
	  wiring them into the Admin UI, since they contain no
	  information other than link IDs.)
	- Search-result listing in Admin web UI does not offer links
	  to sort on virtual fields.
	- Search-result listing in Admin web UI restored to being
	  valid XHTML 1.0.
	- Top-level "resolve" script runs within a scoped block, to
	  ensure that all local ("my") variables go out of scope when
	  the script ends, whatever Apache's memory management regime
	  may be.  This contributes to fixing a memory-exhaustion
	  problem.

1.19  Wed Mar 26 17:22:50 GMT 2008
	- Use the DBI module's connect_cached() method to pool similar
	  connections.  This is important when running the resolver as
	  a web-service, since (currently) each invocation makes a new
	  Resolver object, which in turn makes its own Database
	  object, which until this change made its own DBI
	  connection.  Due to Perl's lazy garbage-collection, each
	  Apache process can accumulate a lot of these connections
	  before they get tidied up, and when (as is usually the case)
	  many Apache processes are used, they can exhaust the
	  back-end database's connection pool.
	- Log-levels (as specified for example by the opt_loglevel
	  query parameter) can now be specified symbolically, as a
	  comma-separated list of level names, as well as numerically.
	- New logging level, LIFECYCLE, notes the creation and
	  destruction of Resolver, OpenURL and Database objects.
	- The DBI logging level can now also be set, using the
	  opt_dbi_trace query parameter.
	- New function LogLevel::num() that converts a logging-level
	  string into a numeric value, complementing the existing
	  label().  Both these functions now handle composite values
	  (e.g. CONVERT01|LIFECYCLE).
	- New test-script for log-level utility functions.
	- Add brief documentation of logging (doc/logging).
	- Option setting is now always done via the option() method
	  rather than, as previously at Resolver creation time, via
	  direct assignment.  This ensures that the logging-related
	  special cases are handled uniformly.
	- Add static_log() function (not method) to the Resolver
	  class, for use in contexts where no Resolver object is
	  available to invoke the method on.
	- Copies are included (web/htdocs/1cate-test/) of the KEV
	  context-objects that were part of Openly's OpenURL 1.0 test
	  suite.  These will be useful one day for local testing.
	- More explicit diagnostics for some database problems.
	- Steps towards support for Oracle as the back-end database:
	  NOT YET COMPLETE.

1.18  Mon Feb 11 11:05:16 GMT 2008
	- Add the ability to delete resource database objects from the
	  Admin UI.

1.17  Thu Feb  7 16:26:37 CET 2008
	- Fix character-set handling AGAIN :-) The resolver library
	  was correcting accepting any specified character encoding
	  and correctly outputting UTF-8 with the necessary XML and
	  HTML specifications to sayt that's what it was doing, but
	  the top level resolver script was telling Perl to do UTF-8
	  encoding on output.  (Why didn't that cause problems when
	  running under Apache 1/mod_perl 1?  Because of the
	  character-set faries.)
	- Generalise rewrite rule so that /resolve/<dbname> URLs are
	  correctly interpreted.  This provides an easy means for
	  running against alternative resource databases.
	- Fix sorting in Admin UI such that it works through
	  successive pages of results.
	- When editing an object in the web-based Admin UI, drop-down
	  option lists that are populated from the database (e.g. the
	  service-types that a service can belong to) are now sorted.
	- Fix a bug in editable_fields(), which was omitting from its
	  output those fields used as links to non-dependent sets
	  (e.g. the set of services implementing a service-type)
	  rather than dependent sets (e.g. the one service-type to
	  which a service belongs).  The result of that bug was that,
	  for example, the raw numeric service_type_id was included on
	  the service editing page as well as the service-type name.
	  No more.
	- The resolver now responds more politely if an attempt is
	  made to access a virtual site not supported by the database,
	  and points the user at a new README file that explains the
	  situation.
	- The service_type table now includes a new "plugin" field
	  which can be used to explicitly specify the name of the Perl
	  plugin to use to implement services of that type, if the
	  required plugin is not named the same as the tag of the
	  service-type.  This allows multiple service-types to share
	  the same plugin.  (When this field is empty, the plugin
	  named after the service-type's tag is used, as before.  Thus
	  the new field is only an override mechanism, and the new
	  arrangement is backwards compatible.)
	- A database patch script is made available to support the
	  new service_type.plugin field: see db/updates/
	- When building URIs from recipes, the resolver now,
	  correctly, accepts the first of several slash-separated
	  candidate fields whose value is defined and non-empty,
	  whereas before it would accept defined but empty values.

1.16  Tue Feb  5 02:57:05 GMT 2008
	- Remove advisory dependency on Apache module from
	  Makefile.PL, as the true dependency is now on EITHER Apache
	  or Apache2, and there is no way to specify that in the
	  PREREQ_PM clause.
	- Modification to how the sample database is built result in a
	  more flexible configuration.
	- Both the resolver itself and the Admin UI issue more a
	  polite, informative message if the Resource Database is not
	  there.
	- Documentation tweaks arising from merge of Apache2 CVS
	  branch back into head.
	- README describes public CVS archive, Debian installation
	  procedure and service-names in the default resource
	  database.

1.15  Mon Jan 28 12:26:37 GMT 2008
	- Fix error in Apache2 debian-package configuration file:
	  mod_rewrite's log was written into /var/log/apache rather
	  than /var/log/apache2, which causes Apache2 to refuse to
	  start if Apache 1.x is not also installed.
	- Comments in Makefile.PL indicate what Debian packages
	  contain each of the prerequisite Perl modules.

1.14  Mon Jan 28 10:49:04 GMT 2008
	- Fix the resolver-site's index page to correctly state the
	  baseURL.  (No functional changes.)

1.13  Thu Jan 24 18:07:56 GMT 2008
	- Small changes to Web configuration to allow Apache 1.x and
	  Apache 2.x installations to co-exist, and to ensure that a
	  Debian install can live side-by-side with a development
	  version.  (Yes, this means that you can -- and I do -- run
	  four instances of the resolver on a single computer.)

1.12  Thu Jan 17 15:50:00 GMT 2008
	- Support for running under both Apache 1.3/mod_perl and
	  Apache 2.0/mod_perl2.
	- Add utility function apache_request() and mod_perl_version()
	  to Keystone::Resolver::Utils to support Apache-version
	  independence.

1.11  Mon Dec 17 11:57:16 GMT 2007
	- Fix bug #1967, which prevented the creation of certain types
	  of record, including Service and User.

1.10  Thu Dec 13 17:27:15 GMT 2007
	- Hardwired username/password pairs for read-only and
	  read-write pairs removed from code.  These are now obtained
	  from the KRuser, KRpw, KRrwuser and KRrwpw environment
	  variables.
	- Set KRuser et al. in web/conf/apache1.3/debian.conf
	- Set KRuser et al. in t/regression.t
	- Fixes to the admin system's new-record-creation and editing
	  system.

1.09  Mon Dec  3 09:46:22 GMT 2007
	- Add documentation to bin/kr-recipe.
	- Remove the obsolete PHP-based Web Admin UI from
	  web/htdocs/dbadmin/
	- Much better Debian packaging.

1.08  Fri Nov 23 18:23:00 GMT 2007
	- Debian packaging.  Currently encompasses the Perl part of
	  the application only (libraries and driver scripts).  A
	  separate Debian package will follow for the Web Admin UI and
	  the main HTTP entry point.

1.07  Fri Sep 21 10:00:40 BST 2007
	- The "deny" boolean field of rule object (both service-type
	  and service rules) is re-cast as an enumeration called
	  "action", with values "include" and "exclude".  This is
	  clearer exposition, and better represents the code.  The
	  underlying database field is still called "deny" and still
	  uses the boolean values 0 and 1, so no database changes are
	  necessary.

1.06  Thu Sep 20 18:50:54 BST 2007
	- Correct implementation of rules: both at the Service-Type
	  and Service levels, and both "include" and "exclude" rules.
	- Default options for the resolver object may now be set from
	  the environment (though they will be overridden by opt_*
	  keys in the OpenURL being resolved).  The KR_OPTIONS
	  environment variable is consulted: it consists of zero or
	  more assignments, separated by commas, each of the form
	  <option>=<value>: for example, "loglevel=32,xml=1".  This is
	  useful when running tests from the command-line.

1.05  Thu Sep 13 11:00:25 BST 2007
	- Genre class includes backlink field "metadata_formats",
	  which is included in its full display.
	- Provides class includes backlink field "services", which is
	  included in its full display.
	- Add "browse" links for each object type as well as "search"
	  in the Admin UI menu-panel.
	- The example form web/htdocs/mod_perl/form2.html now includes
	  a link to the Admin UI.
	- ... and the home page of the Admin UI links to the form.

1.04  Thu Sep 13 00:50:30 BST 2007
	- Change all occurrences of "media format" into "metadata
	  format": the gormer was a mistake.
	- Add links in admin UI to create new records as well as
	  editing existing ones.
	- Extend database with rules for selecting service-types and
	  individual services based on values of fields in the OpenURL
	  itself -- for example, when rfc.dctype=audiobook, omit
	  online bookstores.
	- Add database classes and Web UI for managing both kinds of
	  rules.
	- Better data-dictionary support for Domain (add name),
	  Service (do not display ID field) and User (make
	  summary-list name a link to full record).
	- Web UI can now handle editing booleans and links (using
	  dropdowns, which will not scale well when using large
	  lists).  This works ONLY FOR -TO-ONE LINKS and not for
	  -to-many links.

1.03  Thu Jul 12 12:44:30 BST 2007
	- _makeURI() now understands fallback fieldnames: for example,
	  the sequence %{jtitle/btitle/title} will use jtitle if that
	  is defined, otherwise %btitle if that is defined, otherwise
	  plain title.
	- Added a test-script for _makeURI().
	- Added a new log-level, WARNING.
	- Changed OpenURL::warn() to use $this->log(WARNING).

1.02  Tue Jul 10 12:45:06 BST 2007
	- Admin UI work continues.
	- Add service for linking into MasterKey.
	- Add service for linking into Reindex.
	- Add various hacks in identifier plugins to cope with the
	  nasty COinS OpenURLs generated by WorldCat.

1.01  Fri May 25 09:35:08 BST 2007
	- Add configuration-file fragment for Apache 2.0.x.
	- Changed the format of the XML document generated internally
	  as part of the resolution process (and available to the user
	  by providing the opt_xml query argument as part of the
	  OpenURL).  The new format places the text of each candidate
	  result as CDATA rather than an attribute value, opening the
	  way for more complex values.
	- Updated the XML DTD for the results format to reflect this
	  format change: etc/constraint/results-1.0.dtd
	- Updated the various XSLT stylesheets in etc/xslt to work on
	  the new form of the results XML.
	- Updated the test regression-test's known-good output to
	  match the new XML format.
	- Recipe rendering by Keystone::Resolver::OpenURL::_makeURI()
	  now accepts additional optional pre-special flag "_" which
	  results in the interpolated value being stripped of spaces.
	- Add new command-line utility bin/kr-recipe to test recipe
	  rendering.
	- Correct handling of character sets.
	- Add admin UI: this affects Apache configuration, the core
	  library, many HTML::Mason components, etc.  Not complete
	  yet.

1.00  Fri Jan 26 17:18:37 GMT 2007
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.23 with options
		-X --name=Keystone::Resolver --compat-version=5.8.0 --omit-constant --skip-exporter --skip-ppport
	- Actually, the core of the code is much older than this, but
	  Release 1.0 constitutes a complete repackaging and
	  reorganisation, based on this h2xs invocation.  This allows
	  us to take advantage of the Perl packaging conventions to
	  make the entire distribution, as well as a generally cleaner
	  project layout.  Prior releases were as a Perl module just
	  called "Resolver" (which for that reason would not have been
	  eligible as a CPAN module -- a two-level name is required).
	  Earlier entries in this file describe that old structure.

Revision history for Perl extension Resolver.

0.03  (NOT RELEASED)
	- "make test" now works on Red Hat 9, despite that platform's
	  inability to load DBD::mysql non-lazily, i.e. when
	  PERL_DL_NONLAZY is set.  This is done by hackery in
	  Makefile.PL to prevent PERL_DL_NONLAZY from being set, which
	  is not really a good solution.
	- Move citation generation, full-text reference generation and
	  abstract generation from Resolver::OpenURL into their own
	  plugins.
	- Refine service plugin interface so that the result can be
	  success, no-op, error or non-fatal error.
	- New test-case that checks for unknown journal titles being
	  properly diagnosed.
	- Add ability to request a single service rather than the
	  usual menu using svc_dat=indexdata:<service-type>:<tag>.
	  Add new test-case "feature-single" that exercises this.
	- Add ability for an OpenURL object to render itself as a
	  version 1.0 OpenURL string.  Among other uses, this
	  functions as a v0.1-to-v1.0 converter.
	- Add support for generating Endnote-style citations.
	- Add ability for a ServiceType or individual Service plugin
	  to specify the MIME-type of its result.
	- Result sets consisting of a single, explicitly requested,
	  result are now returned from Resolver::OpenURL::resolve() as
	  self-contained objects of the specified MIME-type rather
	  than embedded in a larger XML or HTML document.  This allows
	  the resolver to generate binary objects such as Endnote
	  citations for download.

0.02  Fri Jul 30 02:23:34 2004
	- First nailed-down version.  This is not yet ready for public
	  release, but it does follow CPAN-like conventions, and
	  passes its own test-suite using the standard sequence "perl
	  Makefile.PL && make && make test", so I am treating this as
	  a baseline from which to describe future changes.

0.01  Wed Jul 28 16:00:52 2004
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.22 with options
		-A -X -b 5.6.0 Resolver
	  In fact, this Perl-module superstructure was retro-fitted to
	  a project that had already undergone a great deal of
	  development prior to the h2xs-ization.
