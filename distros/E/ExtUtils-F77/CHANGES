v1.17 released Jan 1st 2011
---------------------------

* Derek Lamb's patch to avoid an uninitialised variable error.

  Note g77 is still the default if both it and gfortran are present. 
* Rob's big Win32 patch (Nov 2010 version)
*** IMPORTANT. Added in simplification of GNU fortran compilers (g77, gfortran, g95, fort77)
  etc. suggested by Tim Jeness. I used his code but made a slightly different
  implementaion introducing a 'Generic' 'GNU' database entry to which others point.
  This also superceded some of the above patches.
  Hope this works!
* Removed places where .gcclibs() is added to the link line, this appears to no loner
  be necessary. Routine left in there (but orphaned) just in case.
