	  piped open.

0.25   Mon Jun 12 15:57:45 PDT 2006
	- on some platforms, the cache test faile because
	  HTTP::Daemon constructs a URI composed of the 
	  hex representation of the IP address. Caught by
	  Dave Santo (dhsanto at wildblue dot net). Fixed
	  to always go to localhost.

0.24   Fri Jun  2 14:03:47 PDT 2006
	- minor change to test infrastructure: stop depending on
	  content of live pages, which change all the time; use a
	  local server (if possible) instead.

0.23   Fri Mar 31 15:04:16 PST 2006
	- added HTML::TreeBuilder to prereqs (needed
	  for plaintext stuff)

	- strict error in text_like corrected
	- corrected sense of OK tests for 404 and 500 server errors
	  in 06liketext.t

	  from pages

	- add text_like and text_unlike to allow "visual"
	  page content testing (eliminates markup)

	- fix tests looking at python.org (they upgraded
	  to XHTML)
	- fix 05a_agent to not use use_ok()

0.20  Fri Jan  6 11:45:43 PST 2006
	- removed call to agent_alias; setting a default
	  agent causes problems when testing WAP gateways
	- cleaned up test webserver code; now cleanly starts
          on a random port and cleanly shuts down

0.19  Tue Nov 22 14:03:20 2005
	- Actually export last_test!

0.18  Wed Nov 16 15:10:16 2005 
	- Changed page_like and page_unlike to actually fail
	  instead of just issuing a diag when a fetch fails
	- added page_like_full and page_unlike_full for folks
	  who actually want to see the entire page source as 
	  a diag when a test fails

0.17  Wed Nov  9 15:33:01 2005 
	- added last_test, to allow simple_scan plugins to
	  check the status of the last test.

	- Switched underlying Mech object to Mech::Pluggable.
	- Added mech(), for plugin support in future

	- Added alternate bracketing: <xx> and >xx<

	  multiple copies of lines with no substitutions
	  to be emitted when an "xx" pragma was in force

	- updated simple_scan:

	    have matched or not to the test comment

        - added %cache/%nocache pragmas to simple_scan
        - added tests for cache/nocache in simple_scan
        - added pause to webserver-based tests to allow it to spin up

0.08  Mon Feb  1 19:04:34 2005
        - Further updates to simple_scan
          -- expanded %%xx pragma support

        - 100% test coverage!

0.07  Fri Jan 28 11:53:07 2005
        - Updates for simple_scan
          -- comments now supported (# in column 1)
          -- blank lines now supported (d'oh!)
          -- garbage lines now silently discarded
        - Modified logic in page_like/page_unlike to 
          play properly with Test::Harness; now does
          either a fail() or the test, depending on whether
          WWW::Mechanize->get() fails or not.

0.06  Thu Jan 27 15:30:45 2005
