	- POD: document default cache values

0.06	Thu 2008-01-03
	Properly implement destructor.  This lets you undef the $ws
	object to invoke other Open2300 tools without having to exit,
	e.g. to invoke a rain-reset at midnight.

	- close(): release the flock
	- major duh: destructor is named DESTROY(), not DELETE().
	- test suite: another way to handle time zone differences

0.05	Fri 2007-11-16
	- test suite: explicitly set time zone

0.04	Fri 2007-11-16
	- WS23xx.xs : add #include needed by Solaris

0.03	Mon 2007-11-05
	- _ws_reset() : sometimes we get a '0' back.  Ignore it.
	- canonicalize() : 'xxx_datetime' was not being parsed
	  properly.  Thanks to morten bjoernsvik at yahoo dot no
	  for pointing out.

0.02	Wed 2007-10-31
	- implemented destructor + close()
	- for CPAN testing: explicitly require 5.6; disallow building
	  on Windows; add #include needed by Solaris.

0.01	Sun 2007-10-28
        - Initial CPAN release
