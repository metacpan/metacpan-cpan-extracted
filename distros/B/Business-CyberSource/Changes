0.010000  2014-06-17
	[NEWS]
	- Converted to Moose::Exception
	  - IMPORTANT read the removal section
	  - NEVER ever check for ->isa('Moose::Exception') because that's an

	- Added support for American Express Electronic Verification information
	[REMOVAL]
	- Exception::Base - Some exception objects were renamed
	  - CHECK YOUR EXCEPTION HANDLING, it's probably wrong now, sorry. This
	    shouldn't change again, having external classes means supporting new

	    classes
	- MooseX::StrictConstructor
	- Path::Class

	- Client->dumper_package, insufficient, hardcode until suitable replacment
	  written
	- previous deprecations
		- billing_info ( use bill_to )
		- accepted is_accepted ( use is_accept )
	[NOTES]
	- due to changes in processor live tests are failing for me, this release
