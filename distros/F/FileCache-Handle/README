NAME
    FileCache::Handle - A FileCache using IO::Handle instances

SYNOPSIS
      use FileCache::Handle;

      $FileCache::Handle::MAX = 16;

      my @a;
      for (my $i = 0 ; $i < 100 ; $i++) {
        my $o = new FileCache::Handle("/tmp/$i");

        binmode($o, ':utf8');
        push @a, $o;
      }

      for (my $i = 0 ; $i < 3 ; $i++) {
        foreach my $o (@a) {
          print $o "Output ",$o," $i\n";
        }
      }

DESCRIPTION
    FileCache::Handle, like FileCache, avoids OS-imposed limits on the
    number of simultaneously open files. Instances behave like file handles
    and, behind the scenes, real files are opened and closed as necessary.
    FileCache::Handle uses instances of IO::Handle, and so works well with
    'use strict'.

NOTES
    The only operations supported are 'print' and 'binmode'. To add more,
    create a glue method that delegates the call to the handle returned by
    '_allocate()'.

    Unless MAX is set, this class will open as many files as possible before
    closing any. As such, it will monopolise available files, so you should
    open any other files beforehand.
