  - no code changes
  - added Try::Tiny dependency, hoping to catch test errors correctly

0.09 2010/09/23

    writing a set of independent scripts to writing one dispatcher
    script.

    looks for subcommands.

    the lack of recommended modules etc, the dying message will be
    shown in the commands list). (rjbs++)
