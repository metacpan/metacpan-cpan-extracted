        [CHANGES]
         * Renamed distribution and timer reporting methods to more clearly
           convey their operation; now named ->report_distribution and
           ->report_timer
         * Optional name prefix in Collector to simplify use in modules
         * Use metric handle (combined with prefix) if no other name supplied
         * Nicer API for supplying label values to reporting methods
