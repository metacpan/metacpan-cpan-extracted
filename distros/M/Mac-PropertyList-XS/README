NAME
    Mac::PropertyList::XS - work with Mac plists at a low level, really fast

SYNOPSIS
    See Mac::PropertyList and Mac::PropertyList::SAX

DESCRIPTION
    Mac::PropertyList::SAX was my first attempt to speed up property-list
    parsing. It achieves about a 30x speed boost, but large files still take
    too long for my taste. This module addresses some remaining speed gains
    by implementing some expensive operations in C.

    This module is intended to be a drop-in replacement for
    Mac::PropertyList::SAX, which is itself a drop-in replacement for
    Mac::PropertyList.

EXPORTS
    By default, no functions are exported. Specify individual functions to
    export as usual, or use the tags ':all', ':create', and ':parse' for the
    appropriate sets of functions (':create' includes the create* functions
    as well as plist_as_string; ':parse' includes the parse* functions).

FUNCTIONS
    parse_plist_file
        See "parse_plist_file" in Mac::PropertyList

    parse_plist_fh
        See "parse_plist_fh" in Mac::PropertyList

    parse_plist
        See "parse_plist" in Mac::PropertyList

    parse_plist_string
        An alias to parse_plist, provided for better regularity compared to
        Perl SAX.

    create_from_ref( HASH_REF | ARRAY_REF )
        Create a plist from an array or hash reference.

        The values of the hash can be simple scalars or references. Hash and
        array references are handled recursively, and Mac::PropertyList
        objects are output correctly. All other scalars are treated as
        strings (use Mac::PropertyList objects to represent other types of
        scalars).

        Returns a string representing the reference in serialized plist
        format.

    create_from_hash( HASH_REF )
        Provided for backward compatibility with Mac::PropertyList: aliases
        create_from_ref.

    create_from_array( ARRAY_REF )
        Provided for backward compatibility with Mac::PropertyList: aliases
        create_from_ref.
