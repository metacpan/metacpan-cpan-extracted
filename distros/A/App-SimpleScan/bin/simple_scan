=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<simple_scan> is an extensible "little language" for static web page 
testing. It allows you to define tests in terms of I<test specs> (which
tell C<simple_scan> where to go and what to look for there) and I<pragmas>
(which define string substitutions, or alter the way that C<simple_scan>
runs its tests). 

C<simple_scan> is designed to be easy to use. If you know where your page
is (what URL) and can write a basic regular expression to match text on 
that page, you can use C<simple_scan>. 

C<simple_scan> itself is based on a I<pluggable> Perl class; more
sophisticated users can install plugins to extend the language itself,
or even the command-line options that the C<simple_scan> command accepts.

Low-level access to web pages is done via C<WWW::Mechanize::Pluggable>
and C<Test::WWW::Simple>, so it's even possible to build new methods to
access your data into the language by writing plugins for Mech and
C<simple_scan>.

C<simple_scan> is meant to be a I<simple> web testing language, so it
doesn't implement any control structures. You declare what tests are to
be run, and C<simple_scan> then runs them all, telling you at the end
which tests passed and which didn't. It uses TAP (Test Anything
Protocol) to report on the tests, meaning that any C<Test::Harness>-based
program can read and interpret the output.

=head1 BASICS

C<simple_scan> reads either files supplied on the command line, or standard
input. It creates and runs, or prints, or even both, a L<Test::WWW::Simple>
test for the criteria supplied to it.

C<simple_scan>test specs should be in the following format, starting in
column 1:

  <URL> <pattern> <Y|N> <comment>

The I<URL> is any URL; I<pattern> is a Perl regular expression, delimited by
slashes; I<Y|N> is C<Y> if the pattern should match, or C<N> if the pattern 
should B<not> match; and I<comment> is any arbitrary text you like (as long 
as it's all on the same line as everything else).

C<simple_scan>will do its best to try to interpret your pattern; if it can't
parse it as a regular expression, it will assume you meant to match against
a literal character string instead; so a pattern like

   /<b>this</b>/

would be interpreted as the literal string "<b>this</b>".

=head1 COMMAND-LINE SWITCHES

We use L<Getopt::Long> to get the command-line options, so we're really very
flexible as to how they're entered. You can use either one dash (as in
C<-foo>) or two (as in C<--bar>). You only need to enter the minimum number
or characters to match a given switch.

=over 4

=item C<--run>

C<--run> tells C<simple_scan> to immediately run the tests it's created. Can
be abbreviated to C<-r>.

This option is mosst useful for one-shot tests that you're not planning to
run repeatedly.

=item C<--generate>

C<--generate> tells C<simple_scan> to print the test it's generated on the
standard output.

This option is useful to build up a test suite to be reused later.

=back

Both C<-r> and C<-g> can be specified at the same time to run a test and print 
it simultaneously; this is useful when you want to save a test to be run later 
as well as right now without having to regenerate the test.

=over 4

=item C<--define>

C<--define> allows you to predefine substitutions to be used during a 
C<simple_scan> run. To define a substitution, use this syntax:

  --define foo=bar --define baz="one two three"

The first example defines a single substitution; the second defines a
multiple substitution. In conjunction with C<--override>, C<--define>
can make C<simple_scan> ignore any definitions for variables in the
C<simple_scan> input file. Conversely, if C<--defer> is specified, 
any definitions on the command line will be altered if a definition
for the variable is found in the input file.

Note that C<%%forget> can still make C<simple_scan> forget a definition 
(if C<App::SimpleScan::Plugin::Forget> is installed).

Also note that you define a variable with multiple values like this:

  --define foo="bar baz quux"

but B<not> like this:

  --define foo=bar --define foo=baz --define foo=quux

since multiple definitions of a single substitution use only the
I<last> substitution defined; the example directly above (with
the three "--define" entries) defines "foo" as "quux" and only 
as "quux".

=item C<--override>

Makes any definitions entered on the command line override definitions 
found in the input file.

=item C<--defer>

Makes any definitions entered on the command line defer to defintions
found in the input file - the variables in question will be redefined 
by the command file.

=item C<--debug>

Enables debugging for you C<simple_scan> input file; this outputs a 
lot of extra code which, when executed by C<simple_scan --run>, shows
a lot more information as to what actually happened.

Currently, the only extra debugging information is a list of variables
which were I<not> altered by substitution pragmas when C<--override>
was specified on the command line.

=item C<--warn>

Causes simple_scan to output code that gives you warnings (via diag())
in the run file about syntax errors, etc.

=item C<--no-agent>

Tells simple_scan to not set up a default user agent. Some applications
(e.g., mobile applications) actually go into a debug mode when talking to
a detectable (known) browser. This turns off simple_scan's assumption that
you want to look like a browser.

=item C<--autocache>

Turns on caching immediately, whether or not the input file specifies
C<%%cache> or not. Note that a C<%%nocache> in the input file will 
turn caching I<off> again. 

=item c<--status>

Turns on status reporting. Sometimes C<simple_scan> takes a while to 
run (especially if you've defined a lot of variables). This causes it
to pop out a new status message as each input line is processed.

=back

=head1 PRAGMAS

Pragmas are ways to influence what C<simple_scan> does when generating tests.
They are specified with C<%%> in column 1 and the pragma name immediately
following. Any arguments are supplied after a colon, like this:

   %%foo: bar baz

This invokes the C<foo> pragma with the argument C<bar baz>. If you're really
lazy, you can even leave out the colon.

=head2 Substitutions

Any pragma that's otherwise unrecognized by C<simple_scan> is treated as a 
substitution. Substitutions assume that you have a name and a set of strings
following it; these strings wil be substituted into the test specs occuring
between this set of substitutions and the next set. Any variables not
redefined will continue to have their old values.

Here's a basic example. 

   %% user dconway chromatic petdance
   %% use_perl_id Ovid pemungkah
   http://search.cpan.org/~<user>
   http://use.perl.org/~<use_perl_id>/journal/
   http://search.yahoo.com/
   ...
   
This would fetch the CPAN index page for the users dconway, chromatic, and 
petdance, and the use.perl journals for users Ovid and pemungkah. Finally,
it would (just once) fetch the Yahoo! search page - because there are no
substitutions in that line, it would only be evaluated once.

Substitutions can occur anywhere in the line, including in the comment.

Here's another example: internationalization. For instance,
let's assume that you want to substitute each of a list of two-character 
country codes into a string (most likely somewhere in the URL, but possibly 
in the comment too). 

C<simple_scan> will do this for you, creating a test for each country code
you specify. For instance:

   %%xx: es au my jp
   http://<xx>.mysite.com/     /blargh/  Y  look for blargh (<xx>)

This would generate 4 tests, for C<es.mysite.com>, C<au.mysite.com>, 
c<my.mysite.com>, and C<jp.mysite.com>, all looking to match C<blargh> 
somewhere on the page.

=head2 Multiple substitutions in a single line

If you define multiple variables and use them in a test spec, 
C<simple_scan> will create all of the unique combinations of the
values and substitute them into your test spec. For example:

%%foo bar baz
%%quux zorch thud
http://<foo>.yoursite.com?zz=<quux> /Search found/ Y check <quux> search

would generate all four alternatives and run tests for each one:

http://bar.yoursite.com?zz=zorch /Search found/ Y check zorch search
http://baz.yoursite.com?zz=zorch /Search found/ Y check zorch search
http://bar.yoursite.com?zz=thud  /Search found/ Y check thud search
http://baz.yoursite.com?zz=thud  /Search found/ Y check thud search

This makes it very easy to generate many tests from very few input lines.
simple_scan's substitution engine tracks the values of the variables and
ensures that, for any given line, the substitution values stay consistent.

=head2 Nested substitutions

Substitutions can also reference other substitutions, so something 
like this is also possible:

%%mirror blonk whiz thud crunch
%%welcome_msg 'Welcome to <mirror>'
http://<mirror>.yoursite.org/ /<welcome_msg>/ Y <mirror> welcome

When the test spec is expanded, the string 'Welcome to <mirror>'
is substituted in first, then the test spec is expanded again to
create a test for each one of the mirrors.

Note that at present, checking for circular substitutions is not
yet complete; if you write something like this:

%%foo <bar>
%%bar <foo>
http://<foo>.com /check/ Y  Infinite loop

C<simple_scan> will substitute "<bar>" for "<foo>, then "<foo>"
for "<bar>", and will continue to happily do so until you kill 
the process. At the moment, try not to do this; we'll have a fix
in an upcoming release.

=head2 Single-quotes, double-quotes, and backticks

You can use single-quoted strings in substitutions to get exact
strings containing spaces or tabs:

   %%searchtext 'this one' 'that one' 'another one'

The spaces will be preserved in the values assigned to C<searchtext>.

If you want to C<eval> the contents of a string as if it were Perl code
and use that as the value of a substitution, put double quotes around it:

   %%language "$ENV{LANGUAGE}"
   %%now      "@{[scalar localtime]}"

The first example allows you to pass in a value from the environment
variable C<$LANGUAGE>; the second gets the current date and time as a string (so its 
value would be something like "Tue Feb 14 14:21:56 2006").

Lastly, you can use backticked strings to denote a command to be
executed by the shell; the command's output will be used in place of
the quoted string.

As an example, if we have the script C<languages> which looks like this:

  #!/bin/sh
  echo "perl java python ruby"

and the substitution

  %%language `languages`

then the values finally assigned to C<language> would be 
C<perl java ruby python>.

All of the different forms can be mixed on one line, so

  %%try `some_command "value one" value2

would set C<try> to the output of C<some_command>,
C<value one>, and C<value2>.

Finally, since quoted strings are embedded exactly as provided, it's 
possible to parameterize your test specs by using environment variables,
like this:

   %%language $ENV{LANGUAGE}
   http://<language>.org/ /language/i Y <language> should be on the page

Now setting the enviroment variable C<LANGUAGE> in your shell to 'perl'
will propagate 'perl' into the test spec as the language we're testing for.

=head1 OTHER PRAGMAS DEFINED BY SIMPLE_SCAN

There are a few other pragmas defined directly by C<simple_scan>. These
are not plugins, but are implemented directly in the code.

=head2 agent

The C<agent> pragma allows you to switch user agents during the test. 
C<Test::WWW::Simple>'s default is C<Windows IE 6>, but you can switch it
to any of the other user agent aliases supported by C<WWW::Mechanize>.

   http://gemal.dk/browserspy/basic.html /Explorer/ Y Should be Explorer
   %%agent: Mac Safari
   http://gemal.dk/browserspy/basic.html /Safari/ Y Should be Safari

(Note: gemal.dk actually does tell you what browser you're running, so
feel free to try this test yourself.)

=head2 cache

The C<cache> pragma turns on URL caching; once enabled, the page returned
on the I<first> access to a URL is returned directly from a memory cache,
without its being reaccessed from the Web.

Using C<cache> can result in major speedups for tests which repeatedly
hit the same page. 

=head2 nocache

The C<nocache> pragma turns I<off> URL caching; this is useful if you
have something like a REST interface that may return different values 
from repeated accesses to the same URL.

=head1 PLUGINS

simple_scan is extended via plugins in the C<App::SimpleScan::Plugin>
namespace. Currently-released plugins:

=over 4

=item * C<App::SimpleScan::Plugin::Cache> - disk-based caching

=item * C<App::SimpleScan::Plugin::Snapshot> - HTML snapshots of tests

=item * C<App::SimpleScan::Plugin::Plaintext> - check un-marked-up page text

=item * C<App::SimpleScan::Plugin::Retry> - retries HTTP failures

=item * C<App::SimpleScan::Plugin::LinkCheck> - link counting/presence/absence

=item * C<App::SimpleScan::Plugin::Forget> - discard a substitution

Read the documentation for these plugin classes for information on 
pragmas and/or command-line options that they provide.

=back 

=head1 BUGS AND LIMITATIONS

Substitutions, especially when there are large numbers of variables 
with multiple values, are slow. (Welcome to the world of combinatory
explosion.) A future release should use the dependency tree we're 
going to need anyway to detect circular references to eliminate 
variables that cannot possibly be substituted into the current 
string, thereby decreasing the load on the combination checker.
