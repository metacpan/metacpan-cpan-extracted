NAME
    MooX::XSConstructor - glue between Moo and Class::XSConstructor

SYNOPSIS
      package Foo;
      use Moo;
      use MooX::XSConstructor;
  
      # do normal Moo stuff here

DESCRIPTION
    MooX::XSConstructor will look at your class attributes, and see if it
    could be built using Class::XSConstructor. If your class seems too
    complicated, it is a no-op. If your class is simple enough, you will
    hopefully get a faster constructor.

    Which features are too complicated for MooX::XSConstructor to handle?

    *   Any MooX extensions which cause your constructor generator to be
        changed from the default of Method::Generate::Constructor.

        Luckily hardly any extensions exist which do that.
        MooX::StrictConstructor is one fairly popular extension that does, and
        we support that as a special case, but only if you use it with the
        `-late` option.

    *   Any MooX extensions which cause your accessor generator to be changed
        in such a way that it generates the "core set" to be different from
        the standard one.

        Basically what this means is that by standard, Moo attributes can be
        set using `$object->{"attribute_name"} = VALUE`, but if you've got a
        MooX extension that changes that, MooX::StrictConstructor will bail
        out.

        This includes: MooX::InsideOut and MooX::AttributeFilter.

    *   If any of your attributes, including inherited ones, are defined using
        options other than: `is`, `reader`, `writer`, `accessor`, `predicate`,
        `clearer`, `handles`, `handles_via`, `init_arg`, `required`, `isa`,
        `coerce`, `builder`, `default`, `lazy`, `trigger`, `weak_ref`, and
        `documentation`.

        Certain extensions like MooX::Should or MooX::Aliases do define other
        options for attributes, but also clean up after themselves, deleting
        the additional options from the attribute spec before
        MooX::StrictConstructor can see them. So they are okay!

  API
    Normal usage is just to `use MooX::XSConstructor` in your Moo class.
    However, an API is provided.

    `MooX::XSConstructor->setup_for( $class )`
        Run setup for the given class, replacing its constructor with a faster
        XS constructor. Do not call the `setup_for` method until you are sure
        the class has finished compiling, with all attributes already having
        been added (using `has` or role composition).

        Returns the class's name if it successfully replaced the constructor.
        Returns undef otherwise.

    `MooX::XSConstructor->is_suitable_class( $class )`
        Checks that the class is a suitable Moo class for replacing the
        constructor of. `setup_for` calls this, so you don't actually need to
        do this check yourself too.

    MooX::XSConstructor::is_xs( $coderef )
        Returns true if the coderef is implemented with XS. Can be used to
        double-check `setup_for` was successful if you don't trust it for some
        reason.

SEE ALSO
    Moo, Class::XSConstructor.

    You may also be interested in Class::XSAccessor. Moo already includes all
    the glue to interface with that, so a MooX module like this one isn't
    necessary.
