NAME
      Web::Scaffold -- build minimalist fancy web sites

SYNOPSIS
      use Web::Scaffold;

      Web::Scaffold::build(\%specs,\%pages);

DESCRIPTION
    Web::Scaffold is a module that allows you to easily and quickly build a
    fancy web site with drop down menus an a variable number of columns.
    This is accomplished with a simple specification and a series of minimal
    html page includes that are written in very basic html.

    In its simplest form, your web will have the following structure:

      pages/        contains minimalist html pages
      ws_sitemap/   [optional] contains sitemap in google xml format
                    NOTE: link this into public_html
      public_html/  contains the index page and
                    any non Web::Scaffold pages
            images/ contains web site images
            lib/    contains javascript library(s)

    The index pages requires Server Side Includes (SSI) and is as follows:

      <html>
      <!-- page name "index.shtml"
      place your comments, revision number, etc... here
      -->
      <!--#exec cmd="./pages.cgi" -->
      </body>
      </html>

    Alternatively, you can use the included pages.cgi script as an example
    to build your own more sophisticated cgi or mod_perl application.

    An illustrated sample web site can be viewed here:

CONFIGURATION
  build(%specs,%pages)

    A web site with drop down menus can be complete configured with two hash
    arrays. The %specs array configures the style and form of the site and
    the %pages array configures the menus and column layout.

    %specs
        The specifications for fonts, menu, links, colors

          %specs = (

          # directory path for 'html pages' relative to the html root
          # i.e. public_html/        defaults to:
          #
                pagedir         => '../pages',

          # directory path for 'javascript libraries' relative to html root
          # defaults to:

                javascript      => 'lib',

          # no search conditions for building the site map. Each
          # element is evaluated as a perl match condition in the
          # context of m/element/. Include page names, extensions, etc...
          #
          # [OPTIONAL]
          #

                nosearch        => [ 'pdf' ],

          # Directory path for 'sitemap' page generation relative to the 
          # html root. This directory must be WRITABLE by the web server.
          #
          # NOTE: link the file 'sitemapdir'/sitemaplxml to the 
          # appropriate location in your web directory.
          # 
          # The sitemap.xml file will be generated and updated ONLY if 
          # the 'sitemapdir' key is present in this configuration file.
          #
          # The sitemap page will auto update if you modify pages in
          # 'pagedir' or in the 'autocheck' list below. If you modify 
          # static pages elsewhere in the web directory tree that are
          # not listed in 'autocheck', you must DELETE the sitemap.xml 
          # file to force an update.
          #
          # [OPTIONAL]
          #

          # Directories to autocheck for sitemap update.
          # you can list BOTH directories and individual files
          # here relative to the web root. The 'sitemapdir' and
          # 'pagedir' are always checked and do not need to be

                headsize        => '16px',
          );

    %pages
        The specifications for menus and pages. Menus can be single link or
        a series of drop down menu depending on how you specifiy the page.
        The page names are the keys to the hash and are used as the menu-bar
        link text. All page files are placed in the 'pages' directory.

        FILE NAME SYNTAX:

        Files are named with the 'key' name of the page as the lefthand side
        and a suffix designating the file's purpose as the right hand side.
        For the required page 'Home', they are as follows:

         # [optional] page used if there are not individual pages
         # NOTE: neither a Default page or individual page is required
          Default.meta          # meta text loaded after <title>
          Default.head          # optional additional <head> text
                                # that is on every page, end of page
          Default.top           # optional body text that appears
                                # on every page before menu-bar
                                # i.e. logo, etc...
         # for each individual page
          Home.meta             # meta text loaded after <title>
          Home.head             # optional additional <head> text
          Home.top              # body text that appears before
                                # menu-bar. i.e. logo, etc...
          Home.c1               # [optional] column 1 content
          Home.c2               # [optional] column 2 content
          Home.cn               # [optional] column 'n' content

          %pages = (

          # REQUIRED page
          #
                Home    => {
          #                     SEE: detailed link format below

          # optional title text - if missing, 'heading' text will be used
                    title       => 'page title',

          # optional table row immediately under menu. This allows a "drop"
          # shadow to be added to the menu bar with a "1" pixel wide image, 'example'

          # optional
                    heading     => 'Text under menu, over body text',

          # number of columns and column width in pixels
                    column      => [20, 200, 400],    # three columns

          # a named page
                        links   => [qw(Page5 Page6)],

          # optional right hand side text. if there are no links then the
          # text will be placed on the left hand side of the trailer bar
                        text    => 'Copyright 2006, yourname',

          # optional table row immediately above trailer bar. this allows a "drop"
          # shadow to be added to trailer bar with a "1" pixel wide image, 'example'
                        top     => '<img src="images/stripe2.gif" height=4 width=100%>',

          # optional table row immediately below trailer bar. This allows a "top" 
          # shadow to be added to trailer bar with a "1" pixel wide image,  'example'
                        bottom  => '<img src="images/stripe1.gif" height=4 width=100%>',
                    },
                },

          # next page
          #
                Page1   =>      ... same as above
                },
          #
          #     ... and so on

          # for the auto-generated Sitemap page, there is one additional
          # specification element...
          #
                Sitemap => {
                        ...
          # specify the column in which the sitemap should appear
          # defaults to '1'
                        autocol => 1,
                        ...
                },

          # and for debug... example
          # load this page segment as source in a single window

                'Home.top' => {

          # copy prototype page from this one page.

                    debug       => 'Home',

          # optional location if not in the 'pages' directory
          #
                    location    => 'path/to/filename',
                },
          );

OPERATION
    The sample index.shtml and pages.cgi script may be used together with
    the above specification and configuration data to produce a multi-page
    web site with with drop down menus. Each of the sub-pages specified in
    the ./pages directory may be prepared in a simple text editor with
    'basic' html formating. LINKS WITHIN THE PAGE may be regular html or to
    take advantage of the MouseOver and STATUS reporting features of
    Web::Scaffold, may be specified using the special syntax:

  Menu and Trailer link format

    There are two acceptable formats for links used in the MENU and TRAILER
    sections of a page specification:

    1 PageName
        This is simply the key to the %pages array and its value will be
        used as the text for the LINK and the display value in the browser
        STATUS bar.

    2 {separator}key or URL{separator}link text{separator}status text
        This syntax allows for either a PageName as above or a file/http URL
        value to be used as the link target. The separator may be any
        printable ASCII character except {}. The "link text" and "status
        text" values are optional. "link text" will be filled from the
        key/URL value if it is not present. "status text" will be filled
        from the link text or from the key/URL value if link text is not
        present.

          Example:
            #http://my.website.com#visit my website#MY WEBSITE#

        Note that an optional separator character may terminate the link
        string.

  Embedded Links Within Page Text

    The syntax for embedded page links is similar to above with the addition
    of a keyword and enclosing brackets.

      LINK<#page_name#optional link text#optional status text#>
    or
      LINK<#URL#optional link text#optional status text#>

      LINK may also be specified with a CLASS designator for CSS
      The default class is "B"

      Alternate class designations may be specified for classes C thru Z
      which you can then define in a CSS STYLE statement in the [page].head
      portion of the give page.

      Example:
    A.C {
      color: #6666FF;
      background: transparent;
      font-family: VERANDA,ARIAL,HELVETICA,SAN-SERIF;
      font-weight: bold;
      font-size: 16px;
      text-decoration: underline;
    }
    A.C:hover {
      color: #00CC00;
    }

    Exact syntax for LINK is as follows:

      uppercase word        "LINK"
      optional CLASS        C through Z  (default is B)
      less than symbol      <
      delimiter (any char)  #
      page name or url text ./dir/file or http://....
        [optional] link and status fields
      delimiter             #
      link text             optional text for link
      delimiter             #
      status bar text       optional browser status bar text
      delimiter             # [optional] closing delimiter
         required
      greater than symbol   >

    Where the first syntax refers to a named page in the %pages array and
    the second syntax refers to a real URL optionally followed by the text
    to appear as the "link" text and in the status bar.

    Line breaks are not allowed in LINK<#text>

    Web::Scaffold builds the page with menus and incorporates the various
    include files (page.head, page.top, page.c1, page.c2, etc...) to produce
    a website that can be easily and quickly maintained by simply editing
    the page includes.

    Each web page assembled by Web::Scaffold as follows:

      <html>
      <head>
      <title> [from page title or heading] </title>
      [optional] Default.meg\ta or Page.meta
      internally generated style statements
      [optional] Default.head or Page.head
      </head>
      <body>
      [optional] Default.top or Page.top
      [optional] menu bar as specified for this Page
      internally generated column specification for this Page
      {    column 1    }{    column 2    }......{    column N    }
       Page.c1 or blank  Page.c2 or blank .etc.. Page.cN or blank
      [optional] trailer
      </body>
      </html>

  Sitemap

    Web::Scaffold will automatically write as sitemap.xml sitemap file and a
    corresponding scaffold page named Sitemap.htxt the first time the site
    is accessed if the specification KEY, 'sitemapdir' for the sitemap is
    present.

    If you modify any pages in the scaffold 'pagedir' or pages or
    directories listed in the 'autocheck' list, the sitemap will auto
    update. If you modify a static page elsewhere in the web site that are
    not listed in 'autocheck', you must DELETE sitemap.xml to force and
    update.

    You must include a spec for the Sitemap page in the %pages
    configuration.

    If you wish to use your own sitemap, do not activate the specification
    KEY.
