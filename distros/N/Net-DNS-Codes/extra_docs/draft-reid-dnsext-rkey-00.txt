2. Introduction


   The DNS protocol is defined in RFC1034 [refs.RFC1034], RFC1035
   [refs.RFC1035] and clarified in RFC2181 [refs.RFC2181].  The scope
   for using DNS KEY Resource Records was limited in RFC3445
   [refs.RFC3445] to keys used by the Domain Name System Security
   Extensions (DNSSEC) which is defined in RFC4033 [refs.RFC4033],
   RFC4034 [refs.RFC4034] and RFC4035 [refs.RFC4035].  The original KEY
   RR used sub-typing to store both DNSSEC keys and arbitrary
   application keys.  Storing both DNSSEC and application keys with the
   same record type is a mistake so RFC3445 removed application keys
   from the KEY record by redefining the Protocol Octet field in the KEY
   RR Data.  This means that any other uses of keying material in the
   DNS need to define a new RRtype and mnemonic.

   Although this document advocates the introduction of a new resource
   record specifically to provide this type of information for keys that
   encrypt NAPTR records [refs.RFC3403], it can be used for more
   generalised encryption of DNS resource records.  A scheme for
   encrypting NAPTR records is outlined in draft-timms-encrypt-naptr
   [I-D.timms-enum-encrypt].

3. Definition of RKEY Resource Record


   The RKEY RR uses an IANA-assigned type code and is used as resource
   record for storing keys which encrypt NAPTR records.  The RDATA for
   an RKEY RR consists of flags, a protocol octet, the algorithm number
   octet, and the public key itself.  The format is as follows:

   RKEY RDATA format


                       1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 3 3
   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |              flags            |   protocol    |   algorithm   |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |                                                               /
   /                        public key                             /
   /                                                               /
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   All bits of the flags field are reserved and MUST be zero.  The
   protocol field MUST be set to 1.  The algorithm and public key fields
   are identical to the definitions used in RFC4034 [refs.RFC4034].

4. Security Considerations


   The format and correct usage of DNSSEC keys is not changed by this
   document and no new security considerations are introduced.

5. IANA Considerations


   IANA is requested to issue a new type code and mnemonic for the
   proposed resource record.  No other IANA services are required by
   this document.
