NAME
    SSH::RPC::Client - The requestor, or client side, of an RPC call over
    SSH.

SYNOPSIS
     use SSH::RPC::Client;

     my $rpc = SSH::RPC::Client->new($host, $user);
     my $result = $rpc->run($command, \%args); # returns a SSH::RPC::Result object

     if ($result->isSuccess) {
        say $result->getResponse;
     }
     else {
        die $result->getError;
     }

DESCRIPTION
    SSH::RPC::Client allows you to make a remote procedure call over SSH to
    an SSH::RPC::Shell on the other end. In this way you can execute methods
    remotely on other servers while also passing and receiving complex data
    structures. The arguments and return values are serialized into JSON
    allowing shells to be written in languages other than Perl.

METHODS
    The following methods are available from this class.

  ssh
    Constructs and returns a reference to the Net::OpenSSH object.

  new ( host, user,  [ pass ])
    Constructor.

   host
    The hostname or ip address you want to connect to.

   user
    The username you want to connect as.

   pass
    The password to connect to this account. Can be omitted if you've set up
    an ssh key to automatically authenticate. See man ssh-keygen for
    details.

  run ( command, [ args ] )
    Execute a command on the remote shell. Returns a reference to an
    SSH::RPC::Result object.

   command
    The method you wish to invoke.

   args
    If the method has any arguments pass them in here as a scalar, hash
    reference, or array reference.

SEE ALSO
    GRID::Machine and IPC::PerlSSH are also good ways of solving this same
    problem. I chose not to use either for these reasons:

    Arbitrary Execution
        They both allow arbitrary execution of Perl on the remote machine.
        While that's not all bad, in my circumstance that was a security
        risk that was unacceptable. Instead, SSH::RPC requires both a client
        and a shell be written, so you know exactly what's allowed to be
        executed.

    Language Neutral
        Because SSH::RPC uses JSON as a serialization layer between the
        connection, clients and shells can be written in languages other
        than Perl and still interoperate.

    Net::OpenSSH
        The Net::OpenSSH module that SSH::RPC is based upon is fast,
        flexible, and most importantly way easier to install than the
        modules required by GRID::Machine and IPC::PerlSSH.

PREREQS
    This package requires the following modules:

    Net::OpenSSH JSON Class::InsideOut

CAVEATS
    You cannot use this module inside of mod_perl currently. Not sure why,
    but it hoses the SSH connection.
