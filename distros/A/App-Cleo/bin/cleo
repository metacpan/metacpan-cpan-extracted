cleo - Play back shell commands for live demonstrations

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    cleo COMMAND_FILE

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<cleo> is a utility for playing back pre-recorded shell commands in a live
demonstration.  C<cleo> displays the commands as if you had actually typed
them and then executes them interactively.

There is probably an easy way to do this with C<expect> or a similar tool.
But I couldn't figure it out, so I built this.  Your mileage may vary.

=head1 PLAYBACK

C<cleo> always pauses and waits for a keypress before displaying a command and
before executing it.  Pressing any key besides those listed below will advance
the playback:

  Key                       Action
  ------------------------------------------------------------------
  s                         skip the current command
  r                         redo the current command
  p                         redo the previous command
  q                         quit playback

=head1 COMMANDS

C<cleo> reads commands from a file.  Each line is treated as one command.
Blank lines and those starting with C<#> will be ignored.  The commands
themselves can be anything that you would type into an interactive shell.
You can also add a few special tokens that C<cleo> recognizes:

=over 4

=item C<!!!>

Commands starting with C<!!!> (three exclamation points) are not displayed and
will be executed immediately. This is useful for running setup commands at the
beginning of your demonstration.

=item C<%%%>

Within a command, C<%%%> (three percent signs) will cause C<cleo> to pause and
wait for a keypress before displaying the rest of the command.  This is useful
if you want to stop in the middle of a command to give some explanation.

=back

Otherwise, C<cleo> displays and executes the commands verbatim.  Note that
some interactive commands like C<vim> are picky about STDOUT and STDIN.  To
make them work properly with C<cleo>, you may need to force them to attach
to the terminal like this:

    (exec < /dev/tty vim)

=head1 EXAMPLE

I use this for giving demonstrations of L<pinto>, such as the one seen at
L<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-JkFXm8Xgk> (the live demonstration part
starts around 10:47).

The command file that I use for that presentation is included inside this
distribution at F<examples/pinto.demo>.  This file is for illustration only,
so don't expect it to actually work for you.

=head1 LIMITATIONS

C<cleo> only works on Unix-like platforms.  It may work on Windows if you use
Cygwin.  Personally, I have only used C<cleo> on Mac OS X.

=head1 TODO

=over 4

=item Jump to arbitrary command number

=item Support backspacing in recorded command

=item Support multi-line recorded commands

=item Write unit tests
