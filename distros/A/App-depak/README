NAME
    App::depak - Pack your dependencies onto your script file

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.581 of App::depak (from Perl
    distribution App-depak), released on 2019-06-20.

SYNOPSIS
    See depak.

FUNCTIONS
  depak
    Usage:

     depak(%args) -> [status, msg, payload, meta]

    Pack your dependencies onto your script file.

    This function is not exported.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   allow_xs => *array[str]*

    *   args => *array[str]*

        Script arguments.

        Will be used when running your script, e.g. when "trace_method" is
        "fatpacker" or "require". For example, if your script requires three
        arguments: "--foo", 2, "bar baz" then you can either use:

         % depak script output --args --foo --args 2 --args "bar baz"

        or:

         % depak script output --args-json '["--foo",2,"bar baz"]'

    *   debug_keep_tempdir => *bool*

        Keep temporary directory for debugging.

    *   exclude_core => *bool* (default: 1)

        Whether to exclude core modules.

    *   exclude_dist => *array[str]*

        Exclude all modules of dist.

        Just like the "exclude" option, but will exclude module as well as
        other modules from the same distribution. Module name must be the
        main module of the distribution. Will determine other modules from
        the ".packlist" file.

    *   exclude_list => *str*

        Exclude modules from a list in a file.

    *   exclude_module => *array[str]*

        Modules to exclude.

        When you don't want to include a module, specify it here.

    *   exclude_pattern => *array[str]*

        Regex patterns of modules to exclude.

        When you don't want to include a pattern of modules, specify it
        here.

    *   exclude_prereq => *array[str]*

        This option can be used to express that script will depend on a
        specified module, instead of including it packed. The prereq-ed
        module, as well as other modules in the same distribution, as well
        as its prereqs and so on recursively, will be excluded from packing
        as well.

        This option can be used to express dependency to an XS module, since
        XS modules cannot be packed.

        To query dependencies, a local CPAN index is used for querying
        speed. Thus, this option requires that "lcpan" is installed and a
        fairly recent lcpan index is available.

    *   include_dir => *array[str]*

        Include extra modules under directories.

    *   include_dist => *array[str]*

        Include all modules of dist.

        Just like the "include" option, but will include module as well as
        other modules from the same distribution. Module name must be the
        main module of the distribution. Will determine other modules from
        the ".packlist" file.

    *   include_list => *str*

        Include extra modules from a list in a file.

    *   include_module => *array[str]*

        Include extra modules.

        When the tracing process fails to include a required module, you can
        add it here.

    *   include_prereq => *array[str]*

        This option can be used to include a module, as well as other
        modules in the same distribution as that module, as well as the
        distribution's recursive dependencies, for packing. Dependencies
        will be searched using a local CPAN index. This is a convenient
        alternative to tracing a module. So you might want to use this
        option together with setting "trace_method" to "none".

        This option requires that "lcpan" is installed and a fairly recent
        lcpan index is available.

    *   input_file => *str* (default: "-")

        Path to input file (script to be packed).

        "-" (or if unspecified) means to take from standard input
        (internally, a temporary file will be created to handle this).

    *   multiple_runs => *array[hash]*

        Pass to tracepm.

    *   output_file => *str* (default: "-")

        Path to output file.

        "-" (or if unspecified) means to output to stdout.

    *   overwrite => *bool* (default: 0)

        Whether to overwrite output if previously exists.

    *   pack_method => *str* (default: "fatpack")

        Packing method to use.

        Either "fatpack" (the default) or "datapack". Fatpack puts packed
        modules inside Perl variables and load them via require hook.
        Datapack puts packed modules in DATA section. For more details about
        each method, please consult "Module::FatPack" and
        "Module::DataPack".

        One thing to remember is, with datapack, your script cannot load
        modules during compile-time ("use"): all modules must be loaded
        during run-time ("require") when data section is already available.
        Also, your script currently cannot contain data section of its own.

    *   perl_version => *str*

        Perl version to target, defaults to current running version.

        This is for determining which modules are considered core and should
        be skipped by default (when "exclude_core" option is enabled).
        Different perl versions have different sets of core modules as well
        as different versions of the modules.

    *   put_hook_at_the_end => *bool*

        Prefer modules from other sources (filesystem) first.

        Normally, the "fatpack" or "datapack" require hook will be put at
        the front of @INC. If this option is set to true, the require hook
        will be put at the end. This means Perl will search modules from the
        regular sources (filesystem) first. This is useful for example if
        you want your application to use the possibly newer version of
        modules on the filesystem before using the packed version as the
        fallback when some modules are not installed.

    *   shebang => *str* (default: "/usr/bin/perl")

        Set shebang line/path.

    *   skip_not_found => *bool*

        Instead of dying, skip when module to add is not found.

        This option is useful when you use "include_prereq", because modules
        without its own .pm files will also be included (CPAN indexes
        packages, including those that do not have their own .pm files).

        By default, this option is turned off unless when you use
        "include_prereq" where this option is by default turned on. You can
        of course override the default by explicitly specify this option.

    *   squish => *bool* (default: 0)

        Whether to squish included modules using Perl::Squish.

    *   strip => *bool* (default: 0)

        Whether to strip included modules using Perl::Strip.

    *   stripper => *bool* (default: 0)

        Whether to strip included modules using Perl::Stripper.

    *   stripper_comment => *bool* (default: 1)

        Set strip_comment=1 (strip comments) in Perl::Stripper.

    *   stripper_log => *bool* (default: 0)

        Set strip_log=1 (strip log statements) in Perl::Stripper.

    *   stripper_maintain_linum => *bool* (default: 0)

        Set maintain_linum=1 in Perl::Stripper.

    *   stripper_pod => *bool* (default: 1)

        Set strip_pod=1 (strip POD) in Perl::Stripper.

    *   stripper_ws => *bool* (default: 1)

        Set strip_ws=1 (strip whitespace) in Perl::Stripper.

    *   test => *bool*

        Test the resulting output.

        Testing is done by running the resulting packed script with perl. To
        test, at least one test case is required (see "--test-case-json").
        Test cases specify what arguments to give to program, what exit code
        we expect, and what the output should contain.

    *   test_cases => *array[hash]*

        Example case:

         {"args":["--help"], "exit_code":0, "perl_args":["-Mlib::core::only"], "output_like":"Usage:"}

    *   trace_extra_opts => *hash*

        Pass more options to `App::tracepm`.

    *   trace_method => *str* (default: "fatpacker")

        Which method to use to trace dependencies.

        The default is "fatpacker", which is the same as what "fatpack
        trace" does. Different tracing methods have different pro's and
        con's, one method might detect required modules that another method
        does not, and vice versa. There are several methods available,
        please see "App::tracepm" for more details.

        A special value of "none" is also provided. If this is selected,
        then depak will not perform any tracing. Usually used in conjunction
        with "--include-from".

    *   use => *array[str]*

        Additional modules to "use".

        Will be passed to the tracer. Will currently only affect the
        "fatpacker" and "require" methods (because those methods actually
        run your script).

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element (status) is an integer containing HTTP status code (200
    means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second element (msg) is
    a string containing error message, or 'OK' if status is 200. Third
    element (payload) is optional, the actual result. Fourth element (meta)
    is called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information.

    Return value: (any)
