NAME

    Alien::Build::Plugin::Fetch::Cache - Alien::Build plugin to cache files
    downloaded from the internet

VERSION

    version 0.01

SYNOPSIS

     export ALIEN_BUILD_PRELOAD=Fetch::Cache

DESCRIPTION

    This is a Alien::Build plugin that caches the files that you download
    from the internet, so that you only have to download them once. Handy
    when doing development of an Alien distribution. Not a particularly
    smart cache. Doesn't ignore or expire old entries. You have to remove
    them yourself. They are stored in ~/.alienbuild/plugin_fetch_cache.

CAVEATS

    As mentioned, not a sophisticated cache. Patches welcome to make it
    smarter. There are probably lots of corner cases that this plugin
    doesn't take into account, but it is probably good enough for most
    Alien usage.
