PREFACE

This distribution features the Perl 5 module named "Locale::KeyedText"; see
the file lib/Locale/KeyedText.pm for the main documentation, which is in
POD format, plus the Dependencies and Copyright.  The distribution also
includes a Changes file to say what changes already happened, and a TODO
file to say what changes have yet to happen.  The file INSTALL should help
with installation issues.  The examples/ directory contains several small
programs you can try out and see what Locale::KeyedText can do.  Read below
for how to get support or keep up to date.

KEEPING UP TO DATE

My module set is constantly under development.  The canonical copies are
all linked to through my personal website, "http://www.darrenduncan.net/",
or through my business website, "http://www.muldis.com/".

For those of you that are interested in the bleeding edge of development, I
have all parts of the Locale::KeyedText project in one or more public
repositories.  The Perl 5 Locale::KeyedText project is in a Git repository
whose public clone url is "git://github.com/muldis/Locale-KeyedText-Perl5.git" and
whose web information url is at "http://github.com/muldis/Locale-KeyedText-Perl5".
The Perl 6 Locale::KeyedText project used to be in a Subversion repository for
the Perl 6 Pugs project but the host domain pugscode.org has since expired.

You can download slightly older versions of all of my modules from the
public CPAN archives at "http://www.cpan.org/authors/id/D/DU/DUNCAND/", or
on my own web server at "http://www.darrenduncan.net/d/perl/".

CPAN also extracts the POD from modules and maintains that documentation in
an organized and searchable fashion.  Their main search site is at
"http://search.cpan.org", and my own DUNCAND author page is at
"http://search.cpan.org/search?author=DUNCAND".

The main CPAN search site url for Locale::KeyedText for Perl 5 is
"http://search.cpan.org/dist/Locale-KeyedText/"; that is the url you should
link to presently if you want something to consider the "home page" of
Locale::KeyedText; it is best to refer people there by default.

You can download my oldest tarred and gzipped distributions from BACKPAN,
at "http://history.perl.org/backpan/authors/id/D/DU/DUNCAND/", or from my
web server, at "http://www.darrenduncan.net/d/perl/archives/", right back
to the libdwg 1.0, first released on 2000 July 23.

SUPPORT

Currently I don't have any support arranged with other people, lists,
newsgroups, or otherwise.  Feel free to ask me if you can't figure things
out on your own, or another person whom you know has used this.  I may
start a mailing list for support issues later, so that users of this module
can help each other with it.

FIN

Share and Enjoy!
