Algorithm::LDA
  SYNOPSIS
      Algorithm-LDA provides an implementation of Latent Dirichlet Allocation
            in Algorithm.

  INSTALL
        To install these modules run:

          perl Makefile.PL
          make
          make test
          make install

        This will install the modules in the standard locations. You will, 
        most probably, require root privileges to install in standard system
        directories. To install in a non-standard directory, specify a prefix
        during the 'perl Makefile.PL' stage as:

          perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/home

        It is possible to modify other parameters during installation. The
        details of these can be found in the ExtUtils::MakeMaker
        documentation. However, it is highly recommended not messing 
        around with other parameters, unless you know what you're doing.

  CONTENTS
        All the modules that will be installed in the Perl system directory are
        present in the '/lib' directory tree of the package. These include the
        semantic relatedness modules -- 

          Algorithm/LDA.pm 

        -- present in the lib/ subdirectory. All these modules, once installed
        in the Perl system directory, can be directly used by Perl programs.

        The package contains a utils/ directory that contain Perl utility 
        programs. These utilities use the modules or provide some supporting
        functionality.
