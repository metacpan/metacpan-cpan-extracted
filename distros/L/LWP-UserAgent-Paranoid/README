NAME
    LWP::UserAgent::Paranoid - A modern LWPx::ParanoidAgent for safer
    requests

SYNOPSIS
        use LWP::UserAgent::Paranoid;
        my $ua = LWP::UserAgent::Paranoid->new(
            request_timeout => 5   # seconds; may be fractional
        );

        # use $ua as a normal LWP::UserAgent...
        my $response = $ua->get("http://example.com");

        # allow requests to localhost and 127.0.0.1
        $ua->whitelisted_hosts('localhost', '127.0.0.1');

DESCRIPTION
    This module is a more modern LWPx::ParanoidAgent with cleaner internals
    and a very similar feature set. It is a not a drop-in replacement,
    however, since the API differs.

    The primary features provided by this module:

  Overall request timeout
    A configurable timeout from start to finish of a "logical" request made
    by calling one of LWP::UserAgent's request methods. It encompasses all
    followed redirects to ensure that you can't be tarpitted by a series of
    stalling redirects. The default is 5 seconds.

  Blocked private hosts and IP address ranges
    All new agents are automatically made paranoid of private hostnames and
    IP address ranges using LWPx::ParanoidHandler. You may access the
    Net::DNS::Paranoid resolver via the "resolver" method in order to
    customize its behaviour.

    For simple whitelisting and blacklisting, you may call
    "whitelisted_hosts" or "blocked_hosts". These methods are proxied to the
    corresponding methods of Net::DNS::Paranoid. The only difference is that
    you may pass a list to this class' methods.

EVEN MORE PARANOIA
    You may also wish to tune standard LWP::UserAgent parameters for greater
    paranoria depending on your requirements:

  Maximum number of redirects
    Although generally unnecessary given the request timeout, you can tune
    "max_redirects" in LWP::UserAgent down from the default of 7.

  Protocols/URI schemes allowed
    If you don't want to allow requests for schemes other than http and
    https, you may use "protocols_allowed" in LWP::UserAgent either as a
    method or as an option to *new*.

        $ua->protocols_allowed(["http", "https"]);

WHY NOT LWPx::ParanoidAgent?
    LWPx::ParanoidAgent's implemention involves a 2009-era fork of LWP's
    http and https protocol handlers, and it is no longer maintained. A more
    maintainable approach is taken by this module and LWPx::ParanoidHandler.

METHODS
    All methods from LWP::UserAgent are available via inheritence. In
    addition, the following methods are available:

  request_timeout
    Gets/sets the timeout which encapsulates each logical request, including
    any redirects which are followed. The default is 5 seconds. Fractional
    seconds are OK.

  resolver
    Gets the DNS resolver which is used to block private hosts. There is
    little need to set your own but if you do it should be an
    Net::DNS::Paranoid object. This attribute is read-only, so if you want
    to replace the resolver you need to call "new" again to create a new
    LWP::UserAgent::Paranoid.

    Use the blocking and whitelisting methods on the resolver, or this
    class' "whitelisted_hosts" and "blocked_hosts", to customize the
    behaviour.

  whitelisted_hosts / blocked_hosts
    Accepts a single arrayref and proxies to the method of the same name on
    the "resolver". For convenience, you may pass a list which will be
    passed as an arrayref to the resolver's method.

CAVEATS
    The overall request timeout is implemented using SIGALRM. Any $SIG{ALRM}
    handler from an outer scope is replaced in the scope of
    LWP::UserAgent::Paranoid requests.
