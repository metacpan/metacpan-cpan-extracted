NAME
    Data::Str2Num - int str to int; float str to float, else undef. No
    warnings.

SYNOPSIS
     #####
     # Subroutine interface
     #  
     use Data::Str2Num qw(config str2float str2int str2integer);

     $float = str2float($string, [@options]);
     (\@strings, @floats) = str2float(@strings, [@options]);

     $integer = $secspack->str2int($string);

     $integer = str2integer($string, [@options]);
     (\@strings, @integers) = str2int(@strings, [@options]);

     #####
     # Class, Object interface
     #
     # For class interface, use Data::SecsPack instead of $self
     #
     use Data::Str2Num;

     $str2num = 'Data::Str2Num';
     $str2num = new Data::Str2Num;

     $float = $secspack->str2float($string, [@options]);
     (\@strings, @floats) = $secspack->str2float(@strings, [@options]);

     $integer = $secspack->str2int($string);

     $integer = $secspack->str2integer($string, [@options])
     (\@strings, @integers) = $secspack->str2int(@strings, [@options]);

    Generally, if a subroutine will process a list of options, "@options",
    that subroutine will also process an array reference, "\@options",
    "[@options]", or hash reference, "\%options", "{@options}". If a
    subroutine will process an array reference, "\@options", "[@options]",
    that subroutine will also process a hash reference, "\%options",
    "{@options}". See the description for a subroutine for details and
    exceptions.

DESCRIPTION
    The "Data::Str2Num" program module provides subroutines that parse
    numeric strings from the beginning of alphanumeric strings.

  str2float

     $float = str2float($string);
     $float = str2float($string, [@options]);
     $float = str2float($string, {@options});

     (\@strings, @floats) = str2float(@strings);
     (\@strings, @floats) = str2float(@strings, [@options]);
     (\@strings, @floats) = str2float(@strings, {@options});

    The "str2float" subroutine, in an array context, supports converting
    multiple run of integers, decimals or floats in an array of strings
    "@strings" to an array of integers, decimals or floats, "@floats". It
    keeps converting the strings, starting with the first string in
    "@strings", continuing to the next and next until it fails an
    conversion. The "str2int" returns the stripped string data, naked of all
    integers, in "@strings" and the array of floats "@floats". For the
    "ascii_float" option, the members of the "@floats" are scalar strings of
    the float numbers; otherwise, the members are a reference to an array of
    "[$decimal_magnitude, $decimal_exponent]" where the decimal point is set
    so that there is one decimal digit to the left of the decimal point for
    $decimal_magnitude.

    In a scalar context, it parse out any type of $number in the leading
    "$string". This is especially useful for "$string" that is certain to
    have a single number.

  str2int

     $integer = $secspack->str2int($string);

    The "str2int" subroutine is the same as the "str2integer" subroutine
    except that that the subroutine always returns the scalar processing
    "str2integer" subroutine.

  str2integer

     $integer = str2int($string);
     $integer = str2int($string, [@options]);
     $integer = str2int($string, {@options});

     (\@strings, @integers) = str2int(@strings); 
     (\@strings, @integers) = str2int(@strings, [@options]); 
     (\@strings, @integers) = str2int(@strings, {@options}); 

    In a scalar context, the "Data::SecsPack" program module translates an
    scalar string to a scalar integer. Perl itself has a documented
    function, '0+$x', that converts a scalar to so that its internal storage
    is an integer (See p.351, 3rd Edition of Programming Perl). If it cannot
    perform the conversion, it leaves the integer 0. Surprising not all
    Perls, some Microsoft Perls in particular, may leave the internal
    storage as a scalar string.

    What is "$x" for the following:

      my $x = 0 + '0x100';  # $x is 0 with a warning

    Instead use "str2int" uses a few simple Perl lines, without any "evals"
    starting up whatevers or firing up the regular expression engine with
    its interpretative overhead, to provide a slightly different response as
    follows:>.

     $x = str2int('033');   # $x is 27
     $x = str2int('0xFF');  # $x is 255
     $x = str2int('255');   # $x is 255
     $x = str2int('hello'); # $x is undef no warning
     $x = str2int(0.5);     # $x is undef no warning
     $x = str2int(1E0);     # $x is 1 
     $x = str2int(0xf);     # $x is 15
     $x = str2int(1E30);    # $x is undef no warning

    The scalar "str2int" subroutine performs the conversion to an integer
    for strings that look like integers and actual integers without
    generating warnings. A non-numeric string, decimal or floating string
    returns an "undef" instead of the 0 and a warning that "0+'hello'"
    produces. This makes it not only useful for forcing an integer
    conversion but also for testing a scalar to see if it is in fact an
    integer scalar. The scalar "str2int" is the same and supercedes
    C&<Data::StrInt::str2int>. The "Data::SecsPack" program module superceds
    the "Data::StrInt" program module.

    The "str2int" subroutine, in an array context, supports converting
    multiple run of integers in an array of strings "@strings" to an array
    of integers, "@integers". It keeps converting the strings, starting with
    the first string in "@strings", continuing to the next and next until it
    fails a conversion. The "str2int" returns the remaining string data in
    "@strings" and the array of integers "@integers".

1.0 SCOPE
    This paragraph identifies and provides an overview of the released
    files.

  1.1 Identification

    This release, identified in 3.2, is a collection of Perl modules that
    extend the capabilities of the Perl language.

  1.2 System overview

    The "Data::Str2Num" module extends the Perl language (the system).

    The "Data::Str2Num" package translates an scalar string to a scalar
    integer. The package handles parser out of wide range of integers and
    floats from an alphanumeric string in different formats.

    Perl itself has a documented function, '0+$x', that converts a scalar to
    so that its internal storage is an integer (See p.351, 3rd Edition of
    Programming Perl). If it cannot perform the conversion, it leaves the
    integer 0. Surprising not all Perls, some Microsoft Perls in particular,
    may leave the internal storage as a scalar string.

    The "str2int" function is basically the same except if it cannot perform
    the conversion to an integer, it returns an "undef" instead of a 0.
    Also, if the string is a decimal or floating point, it will return an
    undef. This makes it not only useful for forcing an integer conversion
    but also for testing a scalar to see if it is in fact an integer scalar.

  3.3 Changes

    Changes are as follows:

    Data::Str2Num 0.01
        Originated

    Data::Str2Num 0.02
        Added 1 to end of the code section. Unix Perls very strict about
        this one.

    Data::Str2Num 0.03
        Change the test so that test support program modules resides in
        distribution directory tlib directory instead of the lib directory.
        Because they are no longer in the lib directory, test support files
        will not be installed as a pre-condition for the test of this
        module. The test of this module will precede immediately. The test
        support files in the tlib directory will vanish after the
        installtion.

    Data::Str2Num 0.04
        The lastest build of Test::STDmaker expects the test library in the
        same directory as the test script. Coordiated with the lastest
        Test::STDmaker by moving the test library from tlib to t/Data, the
        same directory as the test script and deleting the test library
        File::TestPath program module.

        The "Data::Str2Num" module is now obsolete and superceded by the
        "Data::SecsPack" module. Replace all subroutines to call the
        compatible subroutines in the "Data:SecsPack" module and make any
        necessary manipulates to provide exact equivalent of the old
        "Data::Str2Num" subroutines.

    Data::Str2Num 0.05
        Changed the abstract to 'obsoleted by Data::Secs2'

    Data::Str2Num 0.06
        It was a mistake to merge "Data::Str2Num" subroutines with the
        "Data::Secs2" and "Data::SecsPack" modules. These are specialized
        modules. There are many cases where do not need nor want all that
        SEMI E5 support. Keep these separate means one does not have to deal
        with all that SEMI business if one just needs the functionality of
        these subroutines.

    Data::Str2Num 0.07
        In "str2integer" and "str2float" subroutine, skip empty and undef
        strings. Processing produces all kinds of uninitialize errors.

        Add documentation for the "str2int" subroutine.

  3.4 Adaptation data.

    This installation requires that the installation site has the Perl
    programming language installed. There are no other additional
    requirements or tailoring needed of configurations files, adaptation
    data or other software needed for this installation particular to any
    installation site.

    Installation Instructions.
        To installed the release file, use the CPAN module pr PPM module in
        the Perl release or the INSTALL.PL script at the following web site:

         http://packages.SoftwareDiamonds.com

        Follow the instructions for the the chosen installation software.

        If all else fails, the file may be manually installed. Enter one of
        the following repositories in a web browser:

          http://www.softwarediamonds/packages/
          http://www.perl.com/CPAN/authors/id/S/SO/SOFTDIA/

        Right click on 'Data-Str2Num-0.07.tar.gz' and download to a
        temporary installation directory. Enter the following where $make is
        'nmake' for microsoft windows; otherwise 'make'.

         gunzip Data-Str2Num-0.07.tar.gz
         tar -xf Data-Str2Num-0.07.tar
         perl Makefile.PL
         $make test
         $make install

        On Microsoft operating system, nmake, tar, and gunzip must be in the
        exeuction path. If tar and gunzip are not install, download and
        install unxutils from

         http://packages.softwarediamonds.com

    Prerequistes.
         None.

    Security, privacy, or safety precautions.
        None.

    Installation Tests.
        Most Perl installation software will run the following test
        script(s) as part of the installation:

         t/Data/Str2Num.t

  3.7 Possible problems and known errors

    There is still much work needed to ensure the quality of this module as
    follows:

    *   State the functional requirements for each method including not only
        the GO paths but also what to expect for the NOGO paths

    *   All the tests are GO path tests. Should add NOGO tests.

    *   Add the requirements addressed as *# R: * comment to the tests

    *   Write a program to build a matrix to trace test step to the
        requirements and vice versa by parsing the *# R: * comments.
        Automatically insert the matrix in the Test::TestUtil POD.
