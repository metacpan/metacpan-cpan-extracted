NAME
    App::RabbitTail - Log tailer which broadcasts log lines into RabbitMQ
    exchanges.

SYNOPSIS
        See the rabbit_tail script shipped with the distribution for simple CLI useage.

        use App::RabbitTail;
        use AnyEvent; # Not strictly needed, but you probably want to
                      # use it yourself if you're doing this manually.

        my $tailer = App::RabbitTail->new(
            # At least 1 filename must be supplied
            filename => [qw/ file1 file2 /],
            # Optional args, defaults below
            routing_key => [qw/ # /],
            host => 'localhost',
            port => 5672,
            user => 'guest',
            pass => 'guest',
            vhost => '/',
            exchange_type => 'direct',
            exchange_name => 'logs',
            exchange_durable => 0,
            max_sleep => 10,
        );
        # You can setup other AnyEvent io watchers etc here.
        $tailer->run; # enters the event loop
        # Or:
        $tailer->tail;

DECRIPTION
    App::RabbitTail is a trivial file tail implementation using AnyEvent IO
    watchers, which emits lines from the tailed files into
    <http://www.rabbitmq.com/> via the Net::RabbitFoot client.

    Note that this software should be considered experimental.

BUGS
    Plenty. Along with error conditions not being handled gracefully etc.

    They will be fixed in due course as I start using this more seriously,
    however in the meantime, patches are welcome :)
