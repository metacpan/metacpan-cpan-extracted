NAME
    Z - collection of modules for rapid app development

SYNOPSIS
    This:

     use Z;

    Is a shortcut for:

     use strict;
     use warnings;
     use feature 'say', 'state';
     use namespace::autoclean;
     use Syntax::Keyword::Try 'try';
     use Zydeco::Lite -all;
     use Path::Tiny 'path';
     use Object::Adhoc 'object';
     use match::simple 'match';
     use Types::Standard -types, -is, -assert;
     use Types::Common::String -types, -is, -assert;
     use Types::Common::Numeric -types, -is, -assert;
     use Types::Path::Tiny -types, -is, -assert;

    It will also do `no indirect` if indirect is installed.

DESCRIPTION
    Just a shortcut for loading a bunch of modules that allow you to quickly
    code Perl stuff. I've tried to avoid too many domain-specific modules like
    HTTP::Tiny, etc. The modules chosen should be broadly useful for a wide
    variety of tasks.

  Perl Version Compatibility
    By default, Z requires Perl v5.14, but it has a compatibility mode where
    for Perl v5.8.8 and above.

    It will use Try::Tiny instead of Syntax::Keyword::Try. (Bear in mind that
    these are not 100% compatible with each other.) It will also load
    Perl6::Say as a fallback for the `say` built-in. And it will not provide
    `state`. It will also load UNIVERSAL::DOES if there's no built-in
    UNIVERSAL::DOES method.

    You can specify whether you want the modern modules or the compatibility
    modules:

     use Z -modern;
     # Uses modern modules.
     # Requres Perl 5.14+.
 
     use Z -compat;
     # Uses compatible modules.
     # Requires Perl 5.8.8+.
 
     use Z -detect;
     # Uses modern modules on Perl 5.14+.
     # Prints a warning and uses compatible modules on Perl 5.8.8+.

    The default is `-modern`.

  Additional Functions
    There are a whole bunch of other useful functions that Z *could* make
    available, but it's hard to know the best place to draw the line. So other
    functions are available on request:

     use Z qw( weaken unweaken isweak );
 
     use Z -compat, qw( pairmap pairgrep );
 
     # Rename functions...
     use Z qw( pairmap:pmap pairgrep:pgrep );

    (The things listed in the "SYNOPSIS" are always imported and don't support
    the renaming feature.)

    The additional functions available are: everything from Scalar::Util,
    everything from List::Util, everything from Sub::Util, everything from
    Carp (wrapped versions with `sprintf` functionality, except `confess`
    which is part of the standard set of functions already), `Dumper` from
    Data::Dumper, `maybe` and `provided` from PerlX::Maybe, and `encode_json`
    and `decode_json` from JSON::MaybeXS or JSON::PP (depending which is
    installed).

    If you specify a compatibility mode (like `-modern`), this must be first
    in the import list.
