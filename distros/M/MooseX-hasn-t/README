NAME
    MooseX::hasn't - syntactic sugar to complement "has"

SYNOPSIS
     {
       package Person;
       use Moose;
       has name => (is => "ro", writer => "_rename", required => 1);
     }
 
     {
       package AnonymousPerson;
       use Moose;
       use MooseX::hasn't;
       extends "Person";
       hasn't name => ();
     }
 
     my $dude  = AnonymousPerson->new;
     say($dude->can('_rename') ? 'true' : 'false');  # false
     say($dude->name);                               # croaks

DESCRIPTION
    `hasn't` is a counter-part for Moose's `has`.

    It tries to stop a child class inheriting something (an attribute or a
    method) from its parent class - though it's not always 100% successful.

FAQ
  Doesn't this break polymorphism?
    The idea behind polymorphism is that if *Bar* inherits from *Foo*, then I
    should be able to use an object of type *Bar* wherever I'd normally use
    *Foo*.

    In particular, if I can do:

     Foo->new()->some_method();

    then I should be able to do:

     Bar->new()->some_method();

    But if *Bar* can explicitly indicate that it hasn't got method
    `some_method` then this breaks. So, yes, this module does break
    polymorphism.

    But observe that it's not especially difficult to break polymorphism
    manually:

     {
       package Foo;
       use Moose;
       sub some_method {}
     }
 
     {
       package Bar;
       use Moose;
       extends 'Foo';
       sub some_method { die "some_method not found in package Bar" }
     }

    This module just makes it easier and more declarative.

  How exactly is this achieved?
    For `hasn't $method`, it simply adds an override method modifier to the
    given method that croaks.

    For `hasn't $attribute`, it finds the names of the accessor, reader,
    writer, clearer, predicate and initializer methods for that attribute (if
    any) and overrides them all.

    In both cases, it overrides the class' `can` method too.

  What about required attributes?
    If the parent class has an attribute which is required and has a default,
    then you can use `hasn't` in a child class safely.

    If the parent class has an attribute which is required but has no default,
    then you must explicitly specify a default in the child class:

     hasn't name => (default => 'anon');

    This latter technique is probably not foolproof. Defaults may be coderefs,
    like in `has`.

BUGS AND LIMITATIONS
    *   `hasn't $attr (default => sub {})` will execute the coderef as a
        function with no arguments, not as a method.

    *   `$object->meta` can still see attributes and methods which have been
        "hasn'ted". Some serious Class::MOP fu is needed to fix this.
