This is  a companion module  to DateTime.pm. It implements  the French
Revolutionary calendar and decimal time.

INSTALLATION

The simplest  way, of course, is  using a CPAN  client: CPAN.pm, cpanp
(from CPANPLUS.pm) or cpanm (from App::cpanminus).

If you downloaded  the .tar.gz archive, or if you  cloned the git repo
with

  git clone https://github.com/jforget/DateTime-Calendar-FrenchRevolutionary.git

then the preferred way is either:

   perl Build.PL
   ./Build
   ./Build test
   ./Build install

or

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

Note to the users of old filesystems.

All  filenames  except  one  (the  most  important)  respect  the  8.3
convention  used by  MS-DOS.  If you  use  an old  filesystem such  as
MS-DOS's filesystem or  the old Unix filesystem with  a 14-char limit,
you should find how the name
  lib/DateTime/Calendar/FrenchRevolutionary.pm
has been mangled, rename it  to a name compatible with your filesystem
and replace  all occurrences of the  string "FrenchRevolutionary" with
the new name in all files, including MANIFEST.

ALTERNATE INSTALL

This module can be installed on a perl-less computer!

All you need, on this computer, is:
  - tar and gzip, or compatible software
  - a table-aware HTML browser (no Internet connection required if you
  downloaded the archive from a local network or a CD-ROM)
  - a printer.

The installation steps are:

- Gunzip and untar the archive.
- Go to the eg/result subdirectory.
- Open the various files ending in "en.html" (or, if you are a
French-speaker, ending in "fr.html") with the HTML browser.
- Print them.
That's all!
