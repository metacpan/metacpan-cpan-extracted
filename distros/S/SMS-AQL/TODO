TODO for SMS::AQL

 - new method to send message to multiple recipients at once

 - option to enable/disable concatenation (messages > 160 chars) and set
   maximum length (would be useful just in case some script error in the
   calling script made it try to send an excessively long message

 - improve documentation
 
 - testing with non-UK destination numbers... obviously I don't have a
   non-UK phone to test with, does anybody outside of the UK want to
   help out by performing tests?  Free credits will be allocated for 
   testing.
