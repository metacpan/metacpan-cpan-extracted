SVG/Graph version 0.02
======================

SVG::Graph - Visualize your data in Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) format.

SVG::Graph is a suite of perl modules for plotting data.  SVG::Graph
currently supports plots of one-, two- and three-dimensional data, as well
as N-ary rooted trees.  Data may be represented as:

 Glyph Name	Dimensionality supported
          	1d	2d	3d	tree
 --------------------------------------------------------
 Axis				x
 Bar Graph		x
 Bubble Plot			x
 Heatmap Graph			x
 Line Graph		x
 Pie Graph	x
 Scatter Plot		x
 Spline Graph		x
 Tree					x

SVG::Graph 0.02 is a pre-alpha release. Keep in mind that many of the
glyphs are not very robust.
