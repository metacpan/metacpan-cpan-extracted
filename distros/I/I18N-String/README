NAME
    I18N::String - Delay I18N translation until a variable is stringified

VERSION
    version 0.03

SYNOPSIS
        use I18N::String qw('_');

        I18N::String->localize_via( \&localize );

        my @Days = (
            _('Monday'),   _('Tuesday'),  _('Wednesday'),
            _('Thursday'), _('Friday'),   _('Saturday'),
            _('Sunday')
        );

        sub day_of_week {
            my $day = shift;
            return $Days[$day]
        }

DESCRIPTION
    Sometimes it is useful to store I18N'able strings in variables, but
    delay their translation until the point that they are actually used.
    I18N::String does this for you.

USAGE
  Importing
        use I18N::String;           # exports loc()
        use I18N::String 'foo'      # exports a func named foo()


        my $str = foo('String');

        print $str;                 # localized version of 'String'

  localize_via()
        I18N::String->localize_via( $coderef );

    You need to set this once, and it is global. This is the function that
    will be called when your variable is stringified, to return the
    localized version.

  loc()
    You can also store strings that require arguments, eg:

        $str = _('I found [quant,_1,file,files]');

    And stringify them via:

        $str->loc(@args);
