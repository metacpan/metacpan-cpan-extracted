        [INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE (not that anyone is using this yet...)]

        - Tolerance strings are now of the style 5s, 1h 5m, 2d, etc instead of
          HH:MM:SS.  This replaces DateTime::Format::Duration with
          DateTime::Format::Duration::DurationString since the former's implementation is
          insane and not as useful anyway.  The latter does bring in
          Any::Moose, but I'm hoping to submit a patching switching to Moo soon.
