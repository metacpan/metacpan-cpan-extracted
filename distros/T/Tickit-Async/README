NAME

    Tickit::Async - use Tickit with IO::Async

SYNOPSIS

       use IO::Async;
       use Tickit::Async;
    
       my $tickit = Tickit::Async->new;
    
       # Create some widgets
       # ...
    
       $tickit->set_root_widget( $rootwidget );
    
       my $loop = IO::Async::Loop->new;
       $loop->add( $tickit );
    
       $tickit->run;

DESCRIPTION

    This class allows a Tickit user interface to run alongside other
    IO::Async-driven code, using IO::Async as a source of IO events.

    As a shortcut convenience, a containing IO::Async::Loop will be
    constructed using the default magic constructor the first time it is
    needed, if the object is not already a member of a loop. This will
    allow a Tickit::Async object to be used without being aware it is not a
    simple Tickit object.

    To avoid accidentally creating multiple loops, callers should be
    careful to add the Tickit::Async object to the main application's loop
    if one already exists as soon as possible after construction.
