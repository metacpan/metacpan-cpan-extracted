Log::ger::Manual::Internals - Log::ger internals

=head1 VERSION

version 0.012

=head1 DESCRIPTION

When an importer package does this:

 use Log::ger;

Basically all Log::ger does is construct logging routines and install them to
importer's package (target), e.g. L<log_warn>, L<log_debug>, L<log_is_debug> and
so on. Log::ger also records the target name. When a reinit is requested (e.g.
due to a change of log level or outputs), Log::ger will again construct logging
routines and install them to each target, replacing the old routines.

In addition to installing routines to a package, Log::ger can also target a hash
or an object (which is basically the same as installing to a package, but the
routines will expect to be called as object methods instead of plain
subroutines, i.e. they expect the first argument to be the object).

=head1 GLOSSARY

=head2 Formatter

A routine that takes arguments supplied by the user to the logger routine (e.g.
C<< log_warn("blah", $args, ...) >> and converts it to the message (usually
string) that is sent to the output (or the layouter, if there is one).

=head2 Output

=head2 Log routine

=head2 Is routine

=head2 Layouter

A routine that takes the formatted message (usually a string) and converts it to
the final message string that is sent to output.

=head2 Plugin

A Perl module that supplies hooks.

=head2 Target

=head2 Phase

=head2 Hook

=head2 Hook priority

=head2 Init

The process of constructing logger routines and installing them to targets.

=head1 HOOKS AND PLUGINS

Hooks are how Log::ger provides its flexibility. At various times (phases),
Log::ger will turn to running hooks to get some behavior or result. For example
when wanting to construct a logging routine or formatting routine or
before/after installing logging routines. Plugins, which are modules in the
Log::ger::{Plugin,Output,Format,Filter,...} namespaces, can supply these hooks.

Hooks are stored in the C<%Global_Hooks> variable, where the key is phase name
and the value an array of hook records. Each hook record is in the form of:

 [$key, $prio, $coderef]

where C<$key> is (plugin) package name, C<$prio> is a number between 0-100 (the
lower the number, the higher the priority and the earlier it is run),
C<$coderef> is the actual hook routine. A plugin is supposed to put only at most
one hook per phase.

A hook routine is passed a hash argument and is expected to return an array:

 [$result, $flow_control]

By default each hook will be executed in order of its priority. C<$flow_control>
can be set to 1 by a hook to stop immediately after this hook instead of
continuing to the next. Some phases will nevertheless stop after the first hook
that returns non-undef C<$result>. A hook that returns undef is effectively
declining and causing Log::ger to move to the next hook in the chain.

Aguments received by hook: C<target> (str, can be C<package> if installing to a
package, or C<hash> or C<object>), C<target_arg> (str, when C<target> is
C<package>, will be the package name; when C<target> is C<hash> will be the
hash; when C<target> is C<object> will be the object), C<init_args> (hash,
arguments passed to Log::ger when importing, e.g. C<< {category =>
'My::Package'} >>; it also serves as a per-target stash which survives reinit,
by convention you can put stuffs here under keys that start with C<_>). In some
phases, hook will receive more arguments (see phase documentation below).

Available phases:

=over

=item * create_formatter

Used to construct formatter routine, which will be called with arguments from
the user when she calls the logging routines.

=item * create_layouter

Used to construct layouter routine, which will be called with arguments C<<
($fmsg, \%init_args, $lnum, $lname) >> where C<$fmsg> is formatted message from
the formatter, C<%init_args> are arguments given to C<< Log::ger->get_logger >>
or to Log::ger's import(), C<$lnum> is numeric level, C<$lname> is string level.

=item * create_routine_names

Used to construct routine names. Hook must return this (all keys are optional):

 [{
   log_subs      => [ [NAME, STR_LEVEL], ... ],
   log_methods   => [ [NAME, STR_LEVEL], ... ],

   is_subs       => [ [NAME, STR_LEVEL], ... ],
   is_methods    => [ [NAME, STR_LEVEL], ... ],

   logml_subs    => [ [NAME, undef    ], ... ],
   logml_methods => [ [NAME, undef    ], ... ],
 }]

Where C<log_subs> and C<log_methods> are names of per-level log routines,
C<is_subs> an C<is_methods> are names of per-level level detection routines,
C<logml_subs> and C<logml_methods> are names of multiple-level log routines.

=item * create_log_routine

Used to create per-level "log_I<level>" routines which will be called with C<<
(\%init_args, $msg) >> arguments. Called for each routine specified in the
C<log_subs> (or C<log_methods>) in the routine names (see documentation on
C<create_routine_names> phase). Extra arguments received by hook: C<name>
(routine name), C<level> (numeric level), C<str_level>.

=item * create_is_routine

Used to create per-level "log_is_I<level>" routines. Called for each routine
specified in the C<is_subs> (or C<is_methods>) in the routine names (see
documentation on C<create_routine_names> phase). Extra Arguments received by
hooks: C<name> (routine name), C<level> (numeric level), C<str_level>.

=item * create_logml_routine

Used to create multiple-level "log" routines which will be called with C<<
(\%init_args, $level, $msg) >> arguments. Called for each routine specified in
the C<logml_subs> (or C<logml_methods>) in the routine names (see documentation
on C<create_routine_names> phase). Extra arguments received by hooks: C<name>
(routine name).

=item * before_install_routines

Extra arguments received by hooks: C<routines> which is in the form of:

 [
   [$coderef, $name, $numlevel, $type],
   ...
 ]

Where C<$type> is either C<log_sub>, C<log_method>, C<logml_sub>,
C<logml_method>, C<is_sub>, C<is_method>.

=item * after_install_routines

Extra arguments received by hooks: C<routines>.

=back

Aside from the global hooks, there are also per-target hooks, which are stored
in C<%Per_Package_Hooks>, C<%Per_Hash_Hooks>, C<%Per_Object_Hooks>.

=head1 TARGETS

Log::ger can install logger routines to a package, or an object (which is
similar to installing to a package), or a hash (usually for testing).
