				Docserver
			-------------------------

This is a README file for the docserver/docclient project.

The docclient/docserver allow you to convert MS proprietary formats
to other formats using remote Windows machine and the original MS
software. The docclient/docserver setup provides the transfer of the
file from client machine to the Windows host and runs the conversion
using Word, Excel or Office on that Windows machine.

On the Windows machine, the docserver script has to run. It accepts
network connections, reads the input file, uses OLE calls to convert
that file and sends the output back to client. On the client (most
probably Un*x box) you run a docclient that gets the input file,
sends it to docserver and gets back converted file. You can also use
the Docclient.pm module directly to do the conversion inside of your
larger Perl project.

Installation:
	Please read the INSTALL file for information about getting
	Docserver set and running.

What it does when it works:
	We are able to convert any doc document that is not "too
	complicated". Basically we're dependent on features of MS
	software and on it working correctly. Remember, everything
	that docclient/docserver does is transfer the file to the
	Windows machine and the run Word or Excel on it. Surely there
	are bugs in this code but they are probably not related to the
	quality of the conversion.
	
Problems and bug reports:
	When reporting error, write to me (adelton@fi.muni.cz) and
	mention the word "docserver" somewhere in the Subject line.
	Add info about versions of the modules and output of perl -V,
	on both sides if appropriate.

	You can also add the input doc/xls file that causes you
	problem (attachment is fine, try to gzip it first).
