=head1 DESCRIPTION

This application bears much resemblance to L<< cpan-outdated|App::cpanoutdated >>, but with a few important differences.

=head2 Temporal difference comparison

One of the big features of using the C<MetaCPAN> API, is the ability to filter results into a time bracket.

As such, this application can tell you only about updates that happened to things you have installed C<IF> they've been
recently updated.

For instance, one problem I kept facing was this:

  $ cpan-outdated
  # Broken::Package
  $ cpanm Broken::Package
  # Broken::Package is broken!
  ... wait a few days
  $ cpan-outdated
  # Broken::Package
  $ cpanm Broken::Package
  # Broken::Package is broken!
  ... doh
  ... repeat.

With this app, as soon as C<Broken::Package> falls outside the C<age> window, you stop getting told about it.

B<DU;DC> - Didn't Update, Don't Care.

This also has a benefit that if you run it very frequently, you can get a speed boost by narrowing the update window.

  $ time
  # 12:00
  $ cpan-outdated
  # install ALL the things
  ... wait a while
  $ time
  #  1:00
  $ cpan-outdated-fresh -a 1h
  # One update

Essentially rewarding you for frequent use by being fast for frequent use.

=head3 Downside

Unfortunately, this optimization has a trade-off, namely, it scales very poorly vs time, due to exponential growth.

C<cpan-outdated> uses C<02packages>, which has its limits, and its inefficiencies, but the inefficiencies are effectively
constant due to old packages getting pruned from C<02packages> as newer versions replace them.

So:

  cpan-outdated-fresh -a 30d

Will take substantially more time to execute than

  cpan-outdated

We've tried to combat this by trimming some cycles, but they may still prove over-zealous.

However, this approach is still going to give you C<--dev> results that C<cpan-outdated> can't deliver.
