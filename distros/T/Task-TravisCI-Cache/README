NAME

    Task::TravisCI::Cache - Packages pulled in when building a Perl cache
    for TravisCI

VERSION

    version 0.002

DESCRIPTION

    This task distribution defines the packages installed inside my
    TravisCI cache, at https://github.com/RsrchBoy/travis-p5-cache.

    Note that while I say "my ... cache", that certainly doesn't mean that
    you cannot use it, or that I won't accept pull-requests for the
    inclusion of additional packages (within reason, at least). While I'm
    aiming for a more general use case than "just @RsrchBoy's
    distributions", for right now that provides a convenient initial
    target.

    This distribution is build using the LatestPrereqs plugin, so it will
    always depend on the latest versions of the specified modules at the
    time of creation.

TASK CONTENTS

 All

    The installed version appears to cause some random ABEND on the Travis
    v5.18 image, currently.

  Task::BeLike::RSRCHBOY

  DBIx::Class::Schema::Loader

  Devel::Cover::Report::Coveralls

    The better to see your test coverage, my dear.
