Lingua::EN::Semtags::Engine 0.01
==============================

   Lingua::EN::Semtags::Engine uses Lingua::EN::Tagger and 
   WordNet::QueryData to extract semantic tags (semtags) from 
   English text.  Semtags are words which reflect the semantic 
   essence of the text (similar to topic keywords).

   Lingua::EN::Semtags::Engine was designed and developed to 
   solve a particular problem I was facing.

   Problem: a user is processing blog post titles and needs to 
   programmatically determine the posts' semantic context.

   Solution: the user feeds a blog post title to 
   Lingua::EN::Semtags and gets back a set of semtags which can 
   be used for further processing (e.g., web searches).

   Example: a blog post title like "BBtv: Graffiti Research Lab, 
   the movie" (boingboing.net, Posted by Xeni Jardin, April 24, 
   2008 8:00 AM) would produce the following semtags:
