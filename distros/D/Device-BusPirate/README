NAME

    Device::BusPirate - interact with a Bus Pirate device

DESCRIPTION

    This module allows a program to interact with a Bus Pirate hardware
    electronics debugging device, attached over a USB-emulated serial port.
    In the following description, the reader is assumed to be generally
    aware of the device and its capabilities. For more information about
    the Bus Pirate see:

      http://dangerousprototypes.com/docs/Bus_Pirate

    This module and its various component modules are based on Future,
    allowing either synchronous or asynchronous communication with the
    attached hardware device. For simple synchronous situations, the class
    may be used on its own, and any method that returns a Future instance
    should immediately call the get method on that instance to wait for and
    obtain the eventual result:

     my $spi = $pirate->enter_mode( "SPI" )->get;
    
     $spi->power( 1 )->get;
     my $input = $spi->writeread_cs( $output )->get;

    A truely-asynchronous program would be built using a subclass that
    overrides the basic read and sleep methods for some event loop or
    similar; these can then be chained using the then method:

     my $input = $pirate->enter_mode( "SPI" )
       ->then( sub {
          my ( $spi ) = @_;
    
          $spi->power( 1 )->then( sub {
             $spi->writeread_cs( $output );
          });
       });

CONSTRUCTOR

 new

       $pirate = Device::BusPirate->new( %args )

    Returns a new Device::BusPirate instance to communicate with the given
    device. Takes the following named arguments:

    serial => STRING

      Path to the serial port device node the Bus Pirate is attached to. If
      not supplied, the BUS_PIRATE environment variable is used; falling
      back on a default of /dev/ttyUSB0.

    baud => INT

      Serial baud rate to communicate at. Normally it should not be
      necessary to change this from its default of 115200.

METHODS

    The following methods documented with a trailing call to ->get return
    Future instances.

 sleep

       $pirate->sleep( $timeout )->get

    Returns a Future that will become ready after the given timeout (in
    seconds), unless it is cancelled first.

 enter_mutex

       @result = $pirate->enter_mutex( $code )->get

    Acts as a mutex lock, to ensure only one block of code runs at once.
    Calls to enter_mutex will be queued up; each $code block will only be
    invoked once the Future returned from the previous has completed.

    Mode implementations should use this method to guard complete
    wire-level transactions, ensuring that multiple concurrent ones will
    not collide with each other.

 enter_mode

       $mode = $pirate->enter_mode( $modename )->get

    Switches the attached device into the given mode, and returns an object
    to represent that hardware mode to interact with. This will be an
    instance of a class depending on the given mode name.

    BB

      The bit-banging mode. Returns an instance of
      Device::BusPirate::Mode::BB.

    I2C

      The I2C mode. Returns an instance of Device::BusPirate::Mode::I2C.

    SPI

      The SPI mode. Returns an instance of Device::BusPirate::Mode::SPI.

    Once a mode object has been created, most of the interaction with the
    device would be done using that mode object, as it will have methods
    relating to the specifics of that hardware mode. See the classes listed
    above for more information.

 mount_chip

       $chip = $pirate->mount_chip( $chipname, %opts )->get

    Note: this method is now deprecated in favour of the Device::Chip
    interface. This distribution provides a class,
    Device::Chip::Adapter::BusPirate, suitable to connect an instance of
    the Device::Chip interface to. Any previously-written Bus
    Pirate-specific chip driver classes should now be changed to target the
    generic Device::Chip interface instead.

    Constructs a "chip" object; a helper designed to communicate with some
    particular hardware device (usually a specific chip) attached to the
    Bus Pirate. This will be a subclass of Device::BusPirate::Chip, and
    will likely provide various methods specific to the operation of that
    particular device.

    $chipname should match the name declared by the chip module, and other
    options passed in %opts will be passed to its constructor.

 start

       $pirate->start->get

    Starts binary IO mode on the Bus Pirate device, enabling the module to
    actually communicate with it. Normally it is not necessary to call this
    method explicitly as it will be done by the setup code of the mode
    object.

 stop

       $pirate->stop

    Stops binary IO mode on the Bus Pirate device and returns it to user
    terminal mode. It may be polite to perform this at the end of a program
    to return it to a mode that a user can interact with normally on a
    terminal.

TODO

      * More modes - UART, 1-wire, raw-wire

      * Documentation/examples/actual implementations of truely-async
      subclass.

      * PWM, AUX frequency measurement and ADC support.
