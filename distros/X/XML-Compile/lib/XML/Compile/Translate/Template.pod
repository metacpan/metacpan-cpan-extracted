=head1 NAME

XML::Compile::Translate::Template - create an XML or PERL example

=head1 INHERITANCE

 XML::Compile::Translate::Template
   is a XML::Compile::Translate

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 my $schema = XML::Compile::Schema->new(...);
 print $schema->template(XML  => $type, ...);
 print $schema->template(PERL => $type, ...);

 # script as wrapper for this module
 schema2example -f XML ...

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The translator understands schemas, but does not encode that into
actions.  This module interprets the parse results of the translator,
and creates a kind of abstract syntax tree from it, which can be used
for documentational purposes.  Then, it implements to ways to represent
that knowledge: as an XML or a Perl example of the data-structure which
the schema describes.

=head2 Processing Wildcards

Wildcards are not (yet) supported.

=head2 Schema hooks

Hooks are implemented since version 0.82.  They can be used to
improve the template output.

=head3 hooks executed before the template is generated

None defined yet.

=head3 hooks executed as replacement

The predefined hook C<COLLAPSE> can be used to remove the extensive
listing of some elements.  Usually used with a type of which you
know the structure or which is repeated often.

=head3 hooks for post-processing, after the data is collected

None defined yet.

=head2 Typemaps

Typemaps are currently only available to improve the PERL output.

=head3 Typemaps for PERL template output

You can pass C<< &function_name >> to indicate that the code reference
with variable name C<< $function_name >> will be called.  Mind the change
of C<< & >> into C<< $ >>.

When C<< $object_name >> is provided, then that object is an interface
object, which will be called for the indicated type.

In case class name (any bareword will do) is specified, it is shown
as a call to the C<toXML()> instance method call from some data object
of the specified class.

B<. Example: typemaps with template>

  $schemas->template(PERL => $some_type, typemap =>
    { $type1 => '&myfunc'   # $myfunc->('WRITER', ...)
    , $type2 => '$interf'   # $interf->($object, ...)
    , $type3 => 'My::Class'
    });
