Revision history for Perl module Proc::Pidfile

1.10 2023-05-26 NEILB
    - Fixed and extended backoff handling. PR from E Choroba++
    - Typo fixed in doc via PR from brian d foy.

1.09 2018-09-26 NEILB
    - Only one odd looking fail on CPAN Testers, so doing a non-developer
      release, as that will get more testing.

1.08_05 2018-09-26 NEILB
    - After lots of testing to try and cope with parallel smoke testers,
      decided its best to avoid that problem by having each installation
      create a unique name for the pidfile, so the tests won't collide.

1.08_04 2018-09-24 NEILB
    - Don't bother with /var/run
    - Use File::Spec to portably build paths. Hopefully will sort out
      at least some of the Windows fails on CPAN Testers.

1.08_03 2018-09-16 NEILB
    - I realised that some of the test cases should set the new "retries"
      parameter to zero, otherwise they'll increase the chance of problems
      with parallel smokers.

1.08_02 2018-09-13 NEILB
    - Extended the SEE ALSO section with a bunch of modules for the same task.
    - Changed the parameter name from "attempts" to "retries",
      and added documentation for it.
    - Added verbose message about backing off.

1.08_01 2018-09-12 NEILB
    - If pidfile already exists and process is running,
      retry a couple of times. Parallel smoke testers were producing
      spurious fails; this will hopefully fix that, and is potentially
      a useful feature to have anyway.

1.08 2018-09-07 NEILB
    - Fixes for when running in taint mode. One fix from Laurence Darby,
      and one from me.
    - Include META.json in releases
    - Made the SEE ALSO mention of Proc::PID::File linked -- MANWAR.

1.07_01 2018-09-07 NEILB
    - Fixes for when running in taint mode. One fix from Laurence Darby,
      and one from me.
    - Include META.json in releases

1.07 2018-09-06 NEILB
    - Added [MetaProvides::Package] to dist.ini to address Kwalitee
      suggestion. NAWGLAN++
    - Doc fix from NAWGLAN++
    - The function looking for an unused pid would return $MAXPID if it failed,
      rather than the expected undef. AWRIGLEY++
    - The testsuite would sometimes hang, as a result of the way it was
      looking for PIDs. Changed the way this works, and skip the relevant
      tests if we can't find PIDs. RT#96998 and report from AWRIGLEY.

    - Added [MetaProvides::Package] to dist.ini to address Kwalitee
      suggestion. NAWGLAN++
    - Doc fix from NAWGLAN++

    - The testsuite would sometimes hang, as a result of the way it was
      looking for PIDs. Changed the way this works, and skip the relevant
      tests if we can't find PIDs. RT#96998 and report from AWRIGLEY.

1.06 2014-07-07 NEILB
    - getppid() not supported on Win32 and RISC OS, so now we check if
      we're running those OSes, and don't don't it if we are.
    - Two of the tests loop looking for free or used PIDs. But in some
      situations they can loop infinitely, so now guard against this.
      I think this will prevent the hang on Windows in RT#96998,
      but dealing with this properly needs more investigation and work.

1.05 2014-07-06 NEILB
    - The testsuite was trying to create files with 'Proc::Pidfile' in the
      name, which Windows didn't like. CPAN Testers++

1.04 2014-07-05 NEILB
    - Testsuite was still using Proc::ProcessTable, which meant that the
      change in 1.02 would result in failed tests if you didn't already
      have Proc::ProcessTable installed. Refactored testsuite.

1.03 2014-07-05 NEILB
    - Check whether operations on the pid file (read, write, lock, close)
      are successful, and croak if not.
      Thanks to John Tantalo for RT#67589.

1.02 2014-07-04 NEILB
    - Use kill(0,$pid) to check whether process is still running,
      rather than using Proc::ProcessTable. Apart from on RISC OS.
      DEPESZ++ for RT#56630.

1.01 2014-07-02 NEILB
    - Moved Pidfile.pm to lib/Proc/Pidfile.pm
    - Reformatted this file as per CPAN::Changes::Spec
    - Changed used of die() to croak(), apart from inside DESTROY,
      since in 5.14+, die inside DESTROY doesn't work how you might expect.
      RT#66873
    - Switched to Dist::Zilla
    - Added github repo to pod

1.005 2006-09-27 AWRIGLEY
    - added pidfile to "already running" message

1.004 2004-06-21 AWRIGLEY
    - use Proc::ProcessTable instead of kill 0

1.003 2004-04-01 AWRIGLEY
    - 1 char change to POD talk about minimal release!

1.002 2004-04-01 AWRIGLEY
    - minor POD changes, and fixed test that was checking for exit status

1.001 2003-10-21 AWRIGLEY
    - added README and Changes
    - changed default pidfile to /var/run or $tmpdir

1.000 2003-10-21 AWRIGLEY
    - First release to CPAN
