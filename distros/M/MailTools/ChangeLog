	  reported by [Andreas Koenig]

version 2.00_01: Wed Jun 20 14:42:35 CEST 2007

	  generate nice manuals in POD and HTML.

	  also reported by [Volker Paulsen]

	- die if qmail's exec fails.

	- require Data::Format

	- corrected header field folding according to rfc2822, which
	  may break some ancient (poor) applications.
	  Patch by [Christopher Madsen]

version 1.76: Tue Apr 10 09:25:29 CEST 2007

	- The tag (field label) casing is "normalized" which is not
	  required (as the comment in the code told), but a mis-
	  feature.  The feature will not change, to avoid breaking
	  existing code. Original report by [Matt Swift]

	- Do not ignore unknown argument to Mail::Internet::new(),
	  but complain about it [JPBS]

	- Document that the \n is still after a header line, but folding

	  [Roberto Jimenoca]

version 1.75: Wed Jun 14 15:30:25 CEST 2006

	- [Mike Lerley] reported that environment variables are not
	  thread-safe in mod_perl.  Therefore, we must pass the
	  sender of the message explicitly on qmail's command-line.
	  His addapted patch included.

version 1.74: Tue Feb 28 08:39:14 CET 2006

	- Finally fixed exec with SMTP, with help from [Jun Kuriyama]

	- Added 'use Mail::Util' to Mail::Mailer::testfile to produce
	  mailaddress();

	- Improved exec() call from version 1.67 a little more.  Let's hope
	  that SMTP works again.

version 1.72: Tue Jan 17 09:04:37 CET 2006

	- release 1.70 broke SMTP sending.  Detected by [J Meyers]

version 1.71: Thu Jan  5 11:20:52 CET 2006

	- grrrr tests failed

version 1.70: Thu Jan  5 11:17:05 CET 2006

	- Mail::Mailer::testfile.pm adds "from" display to trace output.
	  [wurblzap]

version 1.68: Thu Jan  5 10:29:25 CET 2006

	- Updated copyright year.

	- Removed 'use locale' from Mail::Address, which tainted the
	  parsed address.  E-mail addresses are ASCII, so this 'locale'
	  thing seems flawed.

	- $adr->name will refuse charset-encoded names.  Found by [kappa]

	- Improve parse-regexes in Mail::Address. By [J Meyers] and me.

version 1.67: Thu Mar 31 12:05:31 CEST 2005

	- Mail::Mailer unfolded the header before sending, which is
	  incorrect. Reported by [Byron Jones]

	- Mail::Header refolded already folded lines destroying
	  blanks.  Signaled by [Byron Jones]

	- Mail::Utils::maildomain now understands DM$m.  Patch by
	  [Nate Mueller]

	- When a Mail::Mailer exec() failes, DESTROY is called on all
	  parential files.  Not anymore thanks to [Randall Lucas]
	  
version 1.66: Thu Jan 20 10:16:10 CET 2005

	- Extended explanation that Mail::Address is limited.

	- Added examples/mail-mailer.pl, contributed by [Bruno Negrão]

	- use Mail::Mailer qw(mail) sets default mailer.  Doc update by
	  [Slavan Rezic]

	- Mail::Mailer::smtp now can authenticate SSL [Aaron J. Mackey]

version 1.65: Wed Nov 24 15:43:17 CET 2004

	- Remove "minimal" comments from Mail::Address

        - [Dan Grillo] suggested some improvements to Mail::Address::name(),
	  and some more were added.

	- [Slavan Rezic] small typo.

version 1.64: Tue Aug 17 22:24:22 CEST 2004

	- CPAN failed to index 1.63 correctly, so hopefully it will
	  work now.

version 1.63: Mon Aug 16 17:28:15 CEST 2004

	- [Craig Davison] Fixed date format in Mail::Field::Date to
	  comply to the RFC

	- [Alex Vandiver] patched the email address parser to be able
	  to understand a list of addresses separated by ';', as Outlook
	  does. The ';' is the group separator, which was not understood
	  by MailTools before, but valid according to the RFCs.

	- [Torsten Luettgert] found that field labels like '-' where not
	  beautified correctly.

	- [Slavan Rezic] Updated doc in Mail::Mailer: referred to $command 
	  which doesn't mean anything, and "testfile" is working differently.

	- [chris] Mail::Message::Field::wellformedName() will upper-case
	  *-ID as part in the fieldname.

version 1.62: Wed Mar 24 13:29:27 CET 2004

	- [Reuven M. Lerner], removed warning by Mail::Address::host()
	  when no e-mail address is provided.

	- [Erik Van Roode] Mail::Mailer::test.pm -> Mail::Mailer::testfile.pm

	- [Jérôme Dion] corrected the folding of lines: folds start only
	  with one blank according to rfc2822.

	- Added a big warning against automatic sender email address
	  detection as provided by Mail::Util::mailaddress().  Please
	  explicitly set MAILADDRESS. This after a discussion with
	  [Wolfgang Friebel].

	- Mail::Address->format should quote phrases with weird character.
	  Patched based on patch by [Marc 'HE' Brockschmidt]

	- [Ruslan U. Zakirov] reported confusing error message when no
	  MailerType was specified.

	- [Steve Roberts] fixed folding to produce longer lines.

version 1.60: Wed Sep 24 09:20:30 CEST 2003

	- [Henrique Martins] found that enclosing parenthesis where not
	  correctly stripped when processing a Mail::Address.

	- [Tony Bowden] asked for a change in Mail::Address::name, where
	  existing (probably correct) capitization is left intact.  The
	  _extract_name() can be called as method, is needed, such that
	  it can be extended.

version 1.59: Wed Aug 13 08:13:00 CEST 2003

	- Patch by [Shafiek Rasdien] which adds Mail::Internet::smtpsend
	  option MailFrom.

	- [Ziya Suzen] extended Mail::Mailer::test to provide more
	  test information.

	  names which is always in caps, on request by [Ronnie Paskin]

	- Added SOAP and LDAP as abbreviation in field names which is
	  always in caps.

	- And again utf8 [Philip Molter]

version 1.57: Tue Jan 14 09:47:46 CET 2003

	- Added myself to the copyright notices... dates needed an update
	  as well.

	- Typos in Mail::Internet [Florian Helmberger]

	- More tries to program around perl5.8.0's uc/lc-utf8 bugs in
	  regexps [Autrijus Tang and Philip Molter]

version 1.56: Mon Jan  6 17:13:17 CET 2003

	- And again, the patches of Autrijus had to be adapted to run on
	  a perl 5.6.1 installation.  Thanks to [Philip Molter]

version 1.55: Mon Jan  6 08:05:58 CET 2003

	- One explicit utf8::downgrade for 5.8.0, this time for
	  Mail::Address by [Autrijus Tang].

version 1.54: Mon Jan  6 08:00:00 CET 2003

	- Another try to avoid the utf8 problems, this time by
	  [Philip Molter]

	- Two explicit utf8::downgrades for 5.8.0, this time for
	  Mail::Field by [Autrijus Tang].

version 1.53: Mon Dec  9 17:53:27 CET 2002

	- New try on work-around for bug in perl 5.8.0 unicode \U within
	  s/// Patched in Mail::Header by [Autrijus Tang]

version 1.52: Fri Nov 29 13:52:00 CET 2002

	- Work-around for bug in perl 5.8.0 unicode \U within s///
	  Patched in Mail::Header by [Autrijus Tang]

version 1.51: Tue Oct 29 14:25:28 CET 2002

	- Mail::Util::maildomain() if no information about domains
	  is found in sendmail.cf, no error should be reported.
	  [Vaughn Skinner]

	- Removed the possibility to use 'mailx', which was the
	  default: removal from the detectionn routines and Mail/Mailer/mail.pm.
	  Strongly suggested by [Sebastian Krahmer]

version 1.50: Wed Sep  4 00:38:49 CEST 2002

	- Mail::Util::domainname() Patch to remove use of S variable from
	  sendmail.cf, because its inclusion is contra-productive.
	  [Timur Bakeyev]

	- Mail::Util::domainname() Clean domain from sendmail.cf from
	  trailing trash (if present) [Timur Bakeyev]

	- Mail::Util::domainname()  Added environment variable MAILDOMAIN
	  to overrule smart domain discovery. [Timur Bakeyev]

version 1.49: Wed Aug 28 08:36:58 CEST 2002

	- t/internet.t defaults $ENV{LOGNAME} to avoid warnings in tests
	  when that variable is not defined. [Chromatic]

	- Mail::Mailer::_clean_up left an extra space behind each header
	  line. Patched by [Robert Spier]

	- Mail::Mailer::_clean_up now also trims folded headerlines on more
	  than two lines.

version 1.48: Wed Aug  7 22:54:56 CEST 2002

	- Mail::Mailer::test only worked in UNIX, because it used the 'test',
	  'sh' and 'cat' command. [Matt Selsky] provided a patch to remove
	  these dependencies.  It may not work on ancient perl versions, but
	  that is not really a problem for a testing facility.

	- The fix for nested comments in Mail::Address's, which went in a long
	  time ago, broke the parser.  As example
	   "Mark Overmeer <mailtools@overmeer.net> (mailtools maintainer)"
	  was parsed into two separate objects.... wrong.
	  [Nicholas Oxhøj] reversed the patch.

version 1.47: Fri Jul  5 12:02:55 CEST 2002

	- Mail::Mailer::_cleanup_headers unfolds the header lines, but
	  forgot to remove the indentation blanks as was discovered by
	  [Meng Weng Wong]

	- Mail::Cap::new has two new options:
	  filename => FILENAME,   which is just long for FILENAME only
	  take => 'ALL', to include all mail-cap files, not only the
	  first one found.  Contributed by [Oleg Muravskiy]

version 1.46: Wed May 29 15:08:44 CEST 2002

	- [Philip Molter] discovered my typo in Mail/Mailer/rfc822.pm
	  which forced me to release a new version....

version 1.45: Thu May 23 10:15:59 CEST 2002

	- [Mark D. Anderson] Add Content-Disposition to the list
	  of structured header fields in Mail::Header.

	- [David Weeler] Added darwin to `mail' versions which require
	  '-I' in Mail::Mailer.

	- [Leon Avery] updated Mail/Mailer/rfc822.pm to be more
	  careful with multi-lined, multi-occurrence headers.

	- [Drieux] small fix in Mail/Mailer/smtp.pm which enables the
	  passing-on of args to Net::SMTP.

	- {Mark Overmeer] Put a message about Mail::Box in Mail::Internet

version 1.44 Sat Mar 23 10:16:47 CET 2002

	- [Andreas Marcel Riechert] add -I to mailx for netbsd and
	  openbsd too.

	- [Nate Mueller] Do respect user's X-Mailer in Mail::Internet
	  above own line.

	- [Alexey Egorov] Header-line without body lost line-separator
	  in Mail::Header.pm

	- [Bo Adler] and [Iosif Fettich] Found that I removed a blank
	  before 'sub smtpsend' which caused AutoSplit to misbehave.

version 1.43: Fri Feb  8 09:43:25 CET 2002

	- [Jason Burnett] Added debug option for Net::SMTP for
	  Mail::Mail::smtp.

	- [Slavan Rezic] + [Jonathan Stowe] Added eval around getpwuid,
	  to avoid croak on Windows.

	- [Slavan Rezic] minor doc update.  The documentation is
	  still poor.

	- A lot of people complaint (and that after so many years that the
	  module is active) about folder lines within words or strings.
	  The mistake in the original implementation was that it tried to
	  fold too hard; folding is a service, but no requirement.
	  So: that overly active folding is removed now.

version 1.42: Mon Dec 10 19:22:01 CET 2001

	- Moved examples from bin/ to examples/, so people may be
	  able to find them.

	- Mail::Util now also tries sendmail option S for domainname.
	  Patched by [Todd R. Eigenschink]

	Included Debian changes by [Steve Kowalik]:
	- Added Mail::Mailer::qmail

version 1.41: Wed Nov 14 10:35:57 CET 2001

	- Mail::Util::maildomain did not expand variables.  Fixed the
	  regular expression.  Reported by [Jean-Damien Durand]

	- [Henrik Gemal] wished better warnings in Mail::Address::parse,
	  which are provided now.

	- [Lucas Nussbaum] reported incorrect folding of unstructured
	  header lines.  The whole idea of folder unstructured fields
	  is flawed, as far as I know, but anyway noone apparently had
	  sufficient long subject fields to find-out ;)
	  Fixed in Mail::Mailer.

version 1.40: Fri Aug 24 20:15:30 CEST 2001

	- mailaddress defaults to username, not gcos in Mail/Util.pm
	  Patched by [Vivek Khera]

	- Increased all version-numbers to show that maintainer-address
	  did change.   Suggested by [Tassilo v Parseval]

	  All packages in this bundle with have the same version!!!
	  The highest number used was 1.33.

version 1.16: Wed Aug  8 11:28:26 CEST 2001
	by Mark Overmeer <mailtools@overmeer.net>

	From now on MailTools will be maintained by Mark Overmeer
	<mailtools@overmeer.net>

	- Updated all manual-pages to include address of new maintainer.

	- Prohibition to modify header should be respected in Mail::Header.
	  Patch by [Tatsuhiko Miyagawa]

	- Securely close socket in Mail::Mailer::smtp.
	  Patch by [Heikki Korpela]

	- Fixed "bad file-descriptor" errors in Mail::Mailer::smtp.
	  Patch by [Aaron J Mackey]

	- Some long header-lines caused the following line in the header
	  to be indented too.  This should be fixed.
	  Reported by [Simon Cozens]

	- Small modifications to Mail::Mailer should make the module
	  work for os2.  Patch by [Ilya Zakharevich]

	- Fix to be able to specify an index at the first addition of
	  a header-line to the Mail::Header structure.
