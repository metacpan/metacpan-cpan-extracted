NAME

    JavaScript::Minifier::XS - XS based JavaScript minifier

SYNOPSIS

      use JavaScript::Minifier::XS qw(minify);
      my $js       = '...';
      my $minified = minify($js);

DESCRIPTION

    JavaScript::Minifier::XS is a JavaScript "minifier"; its designed to
    remove unnecessary whitespace and comments from JavaScript files, which
    also not breaking the JavaScript.

    JavaScript::Minifier::XS is similar in function to
    JavaScript::Minifier, but is substantially faster as its written in XS
    and not just pure Perl.

METHODS

    minify($js)

      Minifies the given $js, returning the minified JavaScript back to the
      caller.

HOW IT WORKS

    JavaScript::Minifier::XS minifies the JavaScript by removing
    unnecessary whitespace from JavaScript documents. Comments (both block
    and line) are also removed, except when (a) they contain the word
    "copyright" in them, or (b) they're needed to implement "IE Conditional
    Compilation".

    Internally, the minification process is done by taking multiple passes
    through the JavaScript document:

 Pass 1: Tokenize

    First, we go through and parse the JavaScript document into a series of
    tokens internally. The tokenizing process does not check to make sure
    you've got syntactically valid JavaScript, it just breaks up the text
    into a stream of tokens suitable for processing by the subsequent
    stages.

 Pass 2: Collapse

    We then march through the token list and collapse certain tokens down
    to their smallest possible representation. If they're still included in
    the final results we only want to include them at their shortest.

    Whitespace

      Runs of multiple whitespace characters are reduced down to a single
      whitespace character. If the whitespace contains any "end of line"
      (EOL) characters, then the end result is the first EOL character
      encountered. Otherwise, the result is the first whitespace character
      in the run.

 Pass 3: Pruning

    We then go back through the token list and prune and remove unnecessary
    tokens.

    Whitespace

      Wherever possible, whitespace is removed; before+after comment
      blocks, and before+after various symbols/sigils.

    Comments

      Comments that are either (a) IE conditional compilation comments, or
      that (b) contain the word "copyright" in them are preserved. All
      other comments (line and block) are removed.

    Everything else

      We keep everything else; identifiers, quoted literal strings,
      symbols/sigils, etc.

 Pass 4: Re-assembly

    Lastly, we go back through the token list and re-assemble it all back
    into a single JavaScript string, which is then returned back to the
    caller.
