Revision history for Hook-Output-Tiny

1.00    2020-12-20
        - Completely redesigned stdout() and stderr(). We now auto-generate
          them dynamically within a BEGIN block
        - _stdout() _stderr() private methods are also now dynamically auto
          generated
        - Code refactoring to reduce number of lines
        - Changed from die() to Carp::croak()

        - Rephrase POD to reflect this dist was written as a learning exercise
          (closes #12)
        - We now return an empty array from stdout() and stderr() if the data
          has been flushed (fixes #10)
        - We now warn if stdout() or stderr() are called in non-list context,
          and that calling in scalar context is deprecated and will be removed
        - Changed from dmake to gmake in Appveyor config
