WWW::AdManager
==============

Description
-----------

WWW::AdManager is a module which implements a web advert management
system. This is based around linked images, that are organized into
"campaigns". Within each campaign, the admanager randomizes the display
of images, and tracks both "page impressions" - i.e. the number of times
the image is displayed - and "clickthroughs" - i.e. the number of times
the image is clicked on.

The module also provides an administration web interface, which can be served
through a access restricted URL, for creating and updating campaigns and
adverts, and displaying usage stats.

The interface support implementation both through CGI and mod_perl.
mod_perl is highly recommended, especially where there are more than one
adver to display per page.

The insertion of adverts into pages is done using SSI (server side
includes - see http://httpd.apache.org/docs/mod/mod_include.html, for
example). The module does both logging of each relevant transaction
(clickthrough / page impression) and live compilation of stats.

Campaigns can be sub-divided into sub-campaigns for more convenient
organization of adverts.
