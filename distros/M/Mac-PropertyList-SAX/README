Mac-PropertyList-SAX

This file describes Mac::PropertyList::SAX, which extends Mac::PropertyList,
using a "real" XML parser from XML::SAX::ParserFactory to speed up processing
of large files (small files may suffer a reduction in performance due to the
overhead of invoking the parser).

See the module POD and Mac::PropertyList for more information.
