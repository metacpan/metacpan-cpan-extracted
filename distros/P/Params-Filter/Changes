Revision history for Params-Filter

v0.011  2026-01-26 (STABLE RELEASE)
    - NEW: Added closure interface with make_filter() function for maximum performance
    - make_filter() creates optimized, reusable closures that can be 20-25% faster than
      hand-written Perl filtering code due to pre-computed exclusion lookups and
      specialized closure variants
    - Three specialized closure variants:
      * Required-only (empty accepted list) - 3.1M ops/sec
      * Wildcard (accepted contains '*') - 1.3M ops/sec, 24% faster than raw Perl
      * Accepted-specific (normal case) - 1.8M ops/sec, 20% faster than raw Perl
    - OPTIMIZED: filter() function now uses same optimizations as closure interface:
      * Pre-computed exclusion hash (O(1) lookups instead of O(n) array search)
      * Hash slice for required field copying (faster bulk operations)
      * Non-destructive operations with hash lookups instead of delete
      * Single wildcard check instead of per-iteration checks
    - All interfaces (functional, OO, closure) now use identical optimization techniques
    - Closure interface is 142-239% faster than functional interface due to:
      * No input parsing overhead (hashref-only input)
      * No error message construction overhead
      * Pre-compiled closures optimized for specific configuration
    - Added comprehensive test suite for make_filter() (t/04-make_filter.t with 10 subtests)
    - Added complete POD documentation for closure interface
    - Added usage examples (examples/closure_interface.pl with 6 working examples)
    - Added benchmark scripts:
      * benchmark-three-variants.pl - Performance comparison of three closure types
      * benchmark-optimized-filter.pl - Optimized filter() vs make_filter() comparison
      * benchmark-make_filter.pl - Closure vs raw Perl performance
    - Updated README.md with closure interface documentation and performance notes
    - Updated performance considerations to clarify that closure interface provides
      maximum speed while functional/OO have feature overhead
    - Changed "database queries" to "database statements" for accuracy (includes inserts/updates)
    - All 73 tests passing across 6 test files
    - POD syntax validated
    - Full backward compatibility maintained

v0.010  2026-01-25 (STABLE RELEASE)
    - Updated documentation to emphasize security, compliance, and correctness
      over raw performance
    - Added "Consistency" as primary benefit: converts varying data formats to
      consistent key-value pairs
    - Rewrote performance section with more nuanced messaging based on
      comprehensive benchmarking
    - Added comprehensive SECURITY documentation section with examples
    - Changed module description from "Fast field filtering" to
      "Secure field filtering"
    - All tests passing

    - POD syntax validated
