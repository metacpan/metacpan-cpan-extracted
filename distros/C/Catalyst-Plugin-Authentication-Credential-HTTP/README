NAME
    Catalyst::Plugin::Authentication::Credential::HTTP - Superseded /
    deprecated module providing HTTP Basic and Digest authentication for
    Catalyst applications.

SYNOPSIS
        use Catalyst qw/
            Authentication
            Authentication::Store::Minimal
            Authentication::Credential::HTTP
        /;

        __PACKAGE__->config->{authentication}{http}{type} = 'any'; # or 'digest' or 'basic'
        __PACKAGE__->config->{authentication}{users} = {
            Mufasa => { password => "Circle Of Life", },
        };

        sub foo : Local {
            my ( $self, $c ) = @_;

            $c->authorization_required( realm => "foo" ); # named after the status code ;-)

            # either user gets authenticated or 401 is sent

            do_stuff();
        }

        # with ACL plugin
        __PACKAGE__->deny_access_unless("/path", sub { $_[0]->authenticate_http });

        sub end : Private {
            my ( $self, $c ) = @_;

            $c->authorization_required_response( realm => "foo" );
            $c->error(0);
        }

DEPRECATION NOTICE
    Please note that this module is DEPRECATED, it has been Superseded by
    Catalyst::Authentication::Credential::HTTP, please use that module in
    any new projects.

    Porting existing projects to use the new module should also be easy, and
    if there are any facilities in this module which you cannot see how to
    achieve in the new module then *please contact the maintainer* as this
    is a bug and *will be fixed*.

    Let me say that again: THIS MODULE IS NOT SUPPORTED, use
    Catalyst::Authentication::Credential::HTTP instead.

DESCRIPTION
    This moduule lets you use HTTP authentication with
    Catalyst::Plugin::Authentication. Both basic and digest authentication
    are currently supported.

    When authentication is required, this module sets a status of 401, and
    the body of the response to 'Authorization required.'. To override this
    and set your own content, check for the "$c->res->status == 401" in your
    "end" action, and change the body accordingly.

  TERMS
    Nonce
        A nonce is a one-time value sent with each digest authentication
        request header. The value must always be unique, so per default the
        last value of the nonce is kept using Catalyst::Plugin::Cache. To
        change this behaviour, override the
        "store_digest_authorization_nonce" and
        "get_digest_authorization_nonce" methods as shown below.

METHODS
    authorization_required %opts
        Tries to "authenticate_http", and if that fails calls
        "authorization_required_response" and detaches the current action
        call stack.

        This method just passes the options through untouched.

    authenticate_http %opts
        Looks inside "$c->request->headers" and processes the digest and
        basic (badly named) authorization header.

        This will only try the methods set in the configuration. First
        digest, then basic.

        See the next two methods for what %opts can contain.

    authenticate_basic %opts
    authenticate_digest %opts
        Try to authenticate one of the methods without checking if the
        method is allowed in the configuration.

        %opts can contain "store" (either an object or a name), "user" (to
        disregard %the username from the header altogether, overriding it
        with a username or user %object).

    authorization_required_response %opts
        Sets "$c->response" to the correct status code, and adds the correct
        header to demand authentication data from the user agent.

        Typically used by "authorization_required", but may be invoked
        manually.

        %opts can contain "realm", "domain" and "algorithm", which are used
        to build %the digest header.

    store_digest_authorization_nonce $key, $nonce
    get_digest_authorization_nonce $key
        Set or get the $nonce object used by the digest auth mode.

        You may override these methods. By default they will call "get" and
        "set" on "$c->cache".

    get_http_auth_store %opts

CONFIGURATION
    All configuration is stored in
    "YourApp->config->{authentication}{http}".

    This should be a hash, and it can contain the following entries:

    store
        Either a name or an object -- the default store to use for HTTP
        authentication.

    type
        Can be either "any" (the default), "basic" or "digest".

        This controls "authorization_required_response" and
        "authenticate_http", but not the "manual" methods.

    authorization_required_message
        Set this to a string to override the default body content
        "Authorization required."

RESTRICTIONS
    When using digest authentication, this module will only work together
    with authentication stores whose User objects have a "password" method
    that returns the plain-text password. It will not work together with
    Catalyst::Authentication::Store::Htpasswd, or
    Catalyst::Plugin::Authentication::Store::DBIC stores whose "password"
    methods return a hashed or salted version of the password.
