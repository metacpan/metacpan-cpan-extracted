=head1 NAME

Fl::Output - Text Display Widget

=head1 Synopsis

    use Fl;
    my $output = Fl::Output->new(0, 0, 100, 200, 'Hello, World!');

=head1 Description

The Fl::Output class represents a widget that displays a single line of text.

When you set the value() , Fl::Output does a strcpy() to its own storage,
which is useful for program-generated values. The user may select portions of
the text using the mouse and paste the contents into other fields or programs.

There is a single subclass, Fl::MultilineOutput, which allows you to display
multiple lines of text. Fl::Multiline::Output does not provide scroll bars.
If a more complete text editing widget is needed, use Fl::TextDisplay instead.

The text may contain any characters except C<\0>, and will correctly display
anything, using C<^X> notation for unprintable control characters and C<\nnn>
notation for unprintable characters with the high bit set. It assumes the font
can draw any characters in the ISO-Latin1 character set.

=head1 Methods

Fl::Output inherits from Fl::Input and Fl::Widget. On top of that, it exposes
the following methods...

=head2 new(...)

    my $text_a = Fl::Output->new(0, 0, 250, 500, 'Important Stuff');
    my $text_b = Fl::Output->new(0, 0, 250, 500);

The constructor creates a new widget using the given position, size, and
label.

The widget's boxtype is FL_DOWN_BOX by default.

The destructor removes the widget.
