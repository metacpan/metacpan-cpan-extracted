NAME
    Mojolicious::Plugin::RoutesConfig - Describe routes in configuration

SYNOPSIS
      # Create $MOJO_HOME/etc/routes.conf and describe your routes
      # or do it directly in $MOJO_HOME/${\ $app->moniker }.conf
      {
        routes => [
          {get  => '/groups', to => 'groups#list', name => 'list_groups'},
          {post => '/groups', to => 'groups#create'},
          {any => {[qw(GET POST)] => '/users'}, to => 'users#list_or_create'},
        ],
      }

      # Mojolicious
      my $config = $app->plugin('Config');
      # or even
      my $config = $app->plugin('RoutesConfig');
      # or
      $app->plugin('RoutesConfig', $config);
      $app->plugin('RoutesConfig', {file => $app->home->child('etc/routes_admin.conf')});
      $app->plugin('RoutesConfig', {file => $app->home->child('etc/routes_site.conf')});

      # Mojolicious::Lite
      my $config = plugin 'Config';
      plugin 'RoutesConfig', $config;
      plugin 'RoutesConfig', {file => app->home->child('etc/routes_admin.conf')};
      plugin 'RoutesConfig', {file => app->home->child('etc/routes_site.conf')};

DESCRIPTION
    Mojolicious::Plugin::RoutesConfig allows you to define your routes in
    configuration file or in a separate file, for example
    "$MOJO_HOME/etc/plugins/routes.conf". This way you can quickly enable
    and disable parts of your application without editing its source code.

    The routes are described the same way as you would generate them
    imperatively, just instead of methods you use method names as keys and
    suitable references as values which will be dereferenced and passed as
    arguments to the respective method. If $parameters is a reference to
    CODE it will be executed and whatever it returns will be the parameters
    for the respective method.For allowed keys look at "METHODS" in
    Mojolicious::Routes::Route. Look at "t/blog/etc/complex_routes.conf" for
    inspiration. You can have all your routes defined in the configuration
    file as it is Perl and you have the "app" object available.

METHODS
    Mojolicious::Plugin::RoutesConfig inherits all methods from
    Mojolicious::Plugin::Config and implements the following new ones.

  register
      my $config = $plugin->register(Mojolicious->new, $config);
      my $config = $plugin->register($app, {file => '/etc/app_routes.conf'});

    Register the plugin in Mojolicious application and generate routes.
