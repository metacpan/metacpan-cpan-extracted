0.003     2014-02-07 12:54:54-05:00 America/New_York

    [CHANGED]

    - More robust error condition detection - now triggers on failures
      in END-block-based test modules (e.g. Test::NoWarnings)
    - Add diagnostic of "Attempted-but-failed-to-load" on perl >= 5.10
    - Minimize amount of reported modules: anything Test::DiagINC loads
      in order to compile the report is excluded
    - No longr chdir() during the local-library heuristic
    - No non-core runtime dependencies, add 5.6 support
