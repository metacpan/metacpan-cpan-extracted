Data::Babel

This module translates biological identifiers based on information
contained in a database.  The principal method is 'translate' which
converts identifiers of one type into identifiers of one or more
output types.  Each Data::Babel object provides a unique mapping over
a set of identifier types. The system as a whole can contain multiple
Data::Babel objects; these may share some or all identifier types, and
may provide the same or different mappings over the shared types.
