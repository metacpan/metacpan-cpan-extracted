Data::Reporter module for Perl
----------------------
version 1.4

Ricardo Vazquez
rvazquez_a@yahoo.com

This module generates ascii reports from a Database or a plain ascii file.


Data::Reporter has a series of components. The user has only to define the 
contents or functions that each component will use or display. Some are 
mandatory (Header, Title, Detail) while others are optional to the user.
Here is the list of all the components:
   - Header
   - Title
   - Detail
   - Breaks
   - Final
   - Footer

Because of perl's multiple plataform availability, the same report program 
can be run in many platforms with no changes in the code. The modules have been tested on Solaris, Windows NT and Windows 95.

A visual report generator called VisRep.pl is also included. This is based
on PerlTk. This program generates perl programs, that can be executed. 
VisRep.pl can be later used to edit such generated programs.

Four examples are included:
example1.pl    Uses a Sybase datasource.
               This program has been created with VisRep.pl
example2.pl    Uses a plain ascii file example2.dat as datasource.
               This program was created with VisRep.pl
example3.pl    The same program as example1.pl, but created by hand.
example4.pl    The same program as example2.pl, but created by hand.

Changes:
--------
1.2 - 1.3
   -Use of functions to access the report's variables
   -Module RepFormat has been migrated to C to improve performance.
   -Add the use of pictures to print (example: "999,999.99")
   -rtrim in all lines of the output file
   -Changes in the internals to improve performance (Thanks to Humberto Hernandez)
   *Note

    generate dates with AAAA-MM-DD format (By Alberto Lago da Silva)
