2017-01-11 v1.13 pjacklam

 * Reorder entries in CHANGES so newest entries are at the top.

 * Sync test files with Math-BigInt-1.999808.

 * Numerous bug fixes and speed improvements.

2004-01-05 v1.12 Tels

 * tests from BigInt v1.68 - 4572 tests

 * require Math::BigInt v1.68

 * hang in test 1635 due to _fac() not handling $x == 0 properly

 * _lsft() created non-chunked sizes (thus failures in broot())

 * streamlined code (removed return statements etc)

 * _as_hex() and _as_bin() handle the $x == 0 case properly

 * _pow() handles 0 ** Y properly

 * __reduce() check for Y's size in _gcd() was wrongly checking $x->Size()

 * _check() method checks for non-chunked sizes

2002-09-30 v1.11_01 Tels (never released)

 * require Bit::Vector 6.3

 * removed unused binary GCD algorithmn

 * removed unnecc. tests for $x or $y == 0 since Bit::Vector 6.3 handles these

2002-03-24 v1.11 Tels

 * tests from BigInt v1.60 - 4057 tests

2002-03-24 v1.10 Tels

 * tests from BigInt v1.55 - 3877 tests

2002-02-21 v1.09 Tels

 * tests from BigInt v1.51

 * replaced _core_lib() by config()->{lib}

2002-02-19 v1.08 Tels

 * added _fac() for factorial speed improvements

 * streamlined some functions (removed return)

 * _mul() does no longer create a result of max($m,$n)*2, but a $m+$n+2 bits
   Quite some performance gains when $m much is greater/smaller than $n.
   The improvement for small numbers is due to the saved call to max()

        Sat Feb 16 19:12:04 2002 Numbers are relative to v1.50_BitVect_v1.07,
                                 100 denotes 100%.
