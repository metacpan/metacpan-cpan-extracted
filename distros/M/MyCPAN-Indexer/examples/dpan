=head1 NAME

dpan - create a DarkPAN from directories

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	# from the command line
	prompt> dpan [-l log4perl.config] [-f config] [directory [directory2]]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The C<dpan> script takes a list of directories, indexes any Perl distributions
it finds, and creates the PAUSE index files from what it finds. Afterward, you
should be able to point a CPAN tool at the directory and install the 
distributions normally.

If you don't specify any directories, it works with the current working
directory.

At the end, C<dpan> creates a F<modules> directory in the first directory 
(or the current working directory) and creates the F<02package.details.txt.gz>
and F<03modlist.data.gz>.
