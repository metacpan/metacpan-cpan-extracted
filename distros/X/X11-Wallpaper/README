NAME
    X11::Wallpaper - set X11 wallpaper using best available helper program

VERSION
    version 1.1

SYNOPSIS
      use X11::Wallpaper qw(set_wallpaper);
      set_wallpaper( "./foo.jpg", {
        mode => 'full',   # default, or: aspect, center, tile
        setter => 'feh',  # override setter
        display => ':0.0' # override X display
      } );

      my @cmd = set_wallaper_command(...); # just give me the command

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides an interface for setting the background on X11
    systems, by recruiting a suitable helper script (feh, Esetroot,
    hsetroot, chbg, xli etc.) and providing appropriate options.

METHODS
  set_wallpaper($image_path, %args)
    Sets $image_path as the desktop wallpaper. The following args are
    supported:

    mode
        May be 'full' (fullscreen, stretched to fit - the default), 'tile',
        'center' (do not stretch) or 'aspect' (fullscreen, preserving aspect
        ratio). For the latter two options, the background for any borders
        around the image is set to black.

    setter
        Manually specify the program to use, e.g. 'qiv', provided it is in
        this module's dictionary of commands.

    display
        Override the X display to use, e.g. ':0.0'. Otherwise defaults to
        the value of the DISPLAY environment variable.

  @cmd = set_wallpaper_command($image_path, %args)
    As with "set_wallpaper", except returns the command (as a list of
    arguments) instead of executing it.

CREDITS
    Inspired by the "awsetbg" shell script by Julian Danjou, which in turn
    is derived from "fbsetbg" by Han Boetes.

TODO
    Skip the middle man and code against the X11 libraries directly. But
    that wouldn't be quite as portable...
