This is an unofficial Plotly Perl module. Currently I'm not affiliated in any way with Plotly. 
But I think plotly.js is a great library and I want to use it with perl.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 TO_JSON

Serialize the trace to JSON. This method should be called only by L<JSON> serializer.

=head2 type

Trace type.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=over

=item * customdata

Assigns extra data each datum. This may be useful when listening to hover, click and selection events. Note that, *scatter* traces also appends customdata items in the markers DOM elements

=item * customdatasrc

Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  customdata .

=item * hoverinfo

Determines which trace information appear on hover. If `none` or `skip` are set, no information is displayed upon hovering. But, if `none` is set, click and hover events are still fired.

=item * hoverinfosrc

Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  hoverinfo .

=item * hoverlabel

=item * ids

Assigns id labels to each datum. These ids for object constancy of data points during animation. Should be an array of strings, not numbers or any other type.

=item * idssrc

Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  ids .

=item * indices

A sequential value, 0..n, supply it to avoid creating this array inside plotting. If specified, it must be a typed `Int32Array` array. Its length must be equal to or greater than the number of points. For the best performance and memory use, create one large `indices` typed array that is guaranteed to be at least as long as the largest number of points during use, and reuse it on each `Plotly.restyle()` call.

=item * indicessrc

Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  indices .

=item * legendgroup

Sets the legend group for this trace. Traces part of the same legend group hide/show at the same time when toggling legend items.

=item * marker

=item * pmeta

Assigns extra meta information associated with this trace that can be used in various text attributes. Attributes such as trace `name`, graph, axis and colorbar `title.text`, annotation `text` `rangeselector`, `updatemenues` and `sliders` `label` text all support `meta`. To access the trace `meta` values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use `%{meta[i]}` where `i` is the index or key of the `meta` item in question. To access trace `meta` in layout attributes, use `%{data[n[.meta[i]}` where `i` is the index or key of the `meta` and `n` is the trace index.

=item * metasrc

Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  meta .

=item * name

Sets the trace name. The trace name appear as the legend item and on hover.

=item * opacity

Sets the opacity of the trace.

=item * showlegend

Determines whether or not an item corresponding to this trace is shown in the legend.

=item * stream

=item * text

Sets text elements associated with each (x,y) pair. If a single string, the same string appears over all the data points. If an array of string, the items are mapped in order to the this trace's (x,y) coordinates. If trace `hoverinfo` contains a *text* flag and *hovertext* is not set, these elements will be seen in the hover labels.

=item * textsrc

Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  text .

=item * uid

Assign an id to this trace, Use this to provide object constancy between traces during animations and transitions.

=item * uirevision

Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name` and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`. Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`, `selectedpoints` is controlled by `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)` (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove traces before the end of the `data` array, such that the same trace has a different index, you can still preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a `uid` that stays with it as it moves.

=item * visible

Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If *legendonly*, the trace is not drawn, but can appear as a legend item (provided that the legend itself is visible).

=item * x

Sets the x coordinates.

=item * xaxis

Sets a reference between this trace's x coordinates and a 2D cartesian x axis. If *x* (the default value), the x coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis`. If *x2*, the x coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis2`, and so on.

=item * xbounds

Specify `xbounds` in the shape of `[xMin, xMax] to avoid looping through the `xy` typed array. Use it in conjunction with `xy` and `ybounds` for the performance benefits.

=item * xboundssrc

Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  xbounds .

=item * xsrc

Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  x .

=item * xy

Faster alternative to specifying `x` and `y` separately. If supplied, it must be a typed `Float32Array` array that represents points such that `xy[i * 2] = x[i]` and `xy[i * 2 + 1] = y[i]`

=item * xysrc

Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  xy .

=item * y

Sets the y coordinates.

=item * yaxis

Sets a reference between this trace's y coordinates and a 2D cartesian y axis. If *y* (the default value), the y coordinates refer to `layout.yaxis`. If *y2*, the y coordinates refer to `layout.yaxis2`, and so on.

=item * ybounds

Specify `ybounds` in the shape of `[yMin, yMax] to avoid looping through the `xy` typed array. Use it in conjunction with `xy` and `xbounds` for the performance benefits.

=item * yboundssrc

Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  ybounds .

=item * ysrc

Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  y .
