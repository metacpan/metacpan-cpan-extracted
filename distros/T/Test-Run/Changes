    * Moved away from an explicit sub new { ... } + _init() to
    the more Moosey "BUILD" and 'default' mechanisms.
    * Added some tests for better test coverage.
    * Got rid of _get_simple_params and _get_private_simple_params .
    * Got rid of the _get_private_fields anti-Moosism.
        - It was not really used.

    to abstract it.
    * Added more test coverage.
    * Changed the output to be more Test-Harness-3.x-like with spaces
    surrounding the "...." leader (after the filename and before the OK).

    undef (in case PERL5LIB is not defined).
        - Thanks to http://pythack.com/ for running the
        http://fc-solve.shlomifish.org/ - based test-suite on his system and

    that will be acceptable on recent versions of TAP::Parser.
    * Changed the name of the construction function from _initialize
    to _init.

    * Wrote a fix to the test failures that Test-Run-0.0115 experienced on
    BSD systems due to a test-script path over 256 bytes.
        - bug in the test script, not the code.
        - http://cpantesters.perl.org/show/Test-Run.html#Test-Run-0.0115
        - thanks to apeiron from Freenode for testing it on Darwin.

0.0115    Fri Apr  4 14:11:27 IDT 2008
    * Added the test file t/01unit-event-wrapper.t. (Fixed a bug when it
    was used in list context).
    * Test::Run::Straps::Base is now the base for Test::Run::Straps
    and Test::Run::Straps::StrapsTotalsObj
    * Fully converted Test::Run::Straps into BSDLed code.
    Test::Run::Straps_GplArt is now just a placeholder for old documentation.
    * Delegated more functionality into TAP::Parser (in ::Straps) while
    refactoring the code.
    * Added the Test.pl example under examples.
    * Added full POD Coverage.
    * Changed the license from "perl" to "mit" as all of the core code is
    now that.
    * A lot of refactoring.
    * Made some changes to the internals to give way for the
    TrimLongFilenames module.

0.0114    Thu Feb 21 07:10:01 IST 2008
    * Now requiring TAP::Parser-3.09, which broke some compatibility with
    earlier versions.
        - fixed the tests to pass with it:
            - http://cpantesters.perl.org/show/Test-Run.html#Test-Run-0.0113

0.0113    Tue Feb 19 20:05:29 IST 2008
    * Converted more functionality from Test::Run::Core_GplArt into
    a BSD-licensed code. Now there's nothing in Core_GplArt except
    (out-of-date) documentation.
    * Moved Test::Run::Straps Test::Run::Straps_GplArt and made
    Test::Run::Straps a BSD-licensed class that inherits from it. Started
    moving functionality and documentation there.
    * Moved Test::Trap from the requires to the build_requires.
    * More refactoring - methods extractions, etc.
    * Added "use strict" and "use warnings" to all the .pm files.
    * Added a link to the MIT X11 license to many modules and some POD to one
    of the modules. This way finding which modules are MIT X11 will be easier
    using grep -rL or grep -rl.
    * Added the _run_sequence method to Test::Run::Base to run a sequence
    of methods one after the other.
    * Added the Test::Run::Straps::EventWrapper class to wrap a
    TAP::Parser::Result and derived objects, and to delegate methods to it.
    * Implemented the delegate_methods() method in Test::Run::Base to
    delegate methods to an accessor.
        - Added the t-r-base-delegate.t test file.
    * Added the Test::Run module which will serve as the front-page for
    the Test::Run suite on search.cpan.org and other resources.

0.0112    Sun Jun 24 19:23:42 IDT 2007
    * Fixed the regression bugs with handling the directory with the
    leaked files, that broke Test::Run::CmdLine, while adding a regression
    test file.

0.0111    Sat Jun 23 11:56:31 IDT 2007
    * Added Test::Run::Base::Plugger for managing classes with plug-ins and
    made the helper classes into pluggable classes.
    * Converted more functionality from Test::Run::Core_GplArt into
    a BSD-licensed code.

0.0110     Mon Jun 11 14:13:58 IDT 2007
    * Converted several helper modules to the MIT X11 licence, while
    refactoring them in the process.
        - every module specifically mentions its licence.
    * Converted several functions to use Text::Sprintf::Named.
    * Added dependence on Text::Sprintf::Named 0.02, in order to better
    refactor the code. Added the T::R::Sprintf::Named::FromAccessors module
    to retrieve values from the accessors. Started refactoring some of the
    code to use it.
    * Added the Test::Run::Trap::Obj class for managing trapping with
    verbose debug information.
        - base on Test::Trap
        - Converted most of the tests to use it.
    * Fixed the Test-Run-Plugin-ColorFileVerdicts module, as it was
    broken due to the refactorings and moving of methods to ::CanonFailedObj.
    * Added the class hierarchy calculation routines.
        - Added the feature to accumulate directly on the class.
        - concept borrowed from (but does not share code with) Class::Std.

0.0109    Mon Mar 19 15:22:35 IST 2007
    * Refactored some code to make it more easily extensible and
    over-ridable. Used in some plugins.
    * Added an ACTION_tags to Test::Run::Builder.
    * Converted the tests to use Test::Trap.

0.0108    Sat Mar 17 18:24:45 IST 2007
    * Now passing $args to _init_strap() so T-R-Plugin-AlternateInterpreters
    can make use of it.
    * Fixed the undef-warnings.t test accordingly.

0.0107    Sat Mar 17 15:01:00 IST 2007
    * Moved a method call to a better place.
    * Normalized the parameters to _time_single_test().
    * Changed Direct hash value acecsses to accessors.
    * Eliminated the $test argument to _canonfailed() and friends because
    it's essentially $self->last_test_obj().
    * Inlined some assignemnts in _dubious_return().
    * Refactored the canonfailed functions.
    * Corrected the license in lib/Test/Run/Obj/CanonFailedObj.pm
    * Added more doucmentation to StrapsTotalObj and TestObj.

0.0106     Fri Mar 16 15:29:14 IST 2007
    * Removed the %fields_map variables that were not used.
    * Placed Test::Run::Base::Struct in its own .pm file.
    * Placed the structs objects in their own .pm files.
    * Implemented _tot_inc as tot()->inc($field) for better encapsulation.
      Added the relevant method to TotObj.pm.
    * Replaced the loading of Test::Run::Obj::Structs with the loading
      of its individual modules.
    * Moved a lot of logic to Test::Run::Straps::StrapsTotalsObj.
    * Extracted some methods.
    * Refactored the maximal numbers/length handling.
    * Added the List::Util to the dependencies.
    * Passing the filename inside Test::Run::Straps::StrapsTotalsObj.
    * In the test script analysis phase - eliminated passing objects from
      one method to another by making them instance slots.

0.0105    Mon Mar 12 23:46:34 IST 2007
    * Converted from TAPx::Parser 0.3x to TAP::Parser 0.51, including various
    changes to the tests and code to get over several regressions.

0.0104    Fri Feb 23 14:25:29 IST 2007
    * Added an empty PL_FILES key to the Makefile.PL to please old
      ExtUtils::MakeMaker's that try to invoke "Build.PL Build".
    * Fixed the skip to skip 7 tests instead of 8 - it broke the build
      in perl-5.6.2.

0.0103    Fri Feb 16 23:09:24 IST 2007
    * Made part of the Straps code clearer.
    * Extracted out the _init_strap method. This will be used by future
    plugins.
    * Fixed a bug where the modified Test_Interperter was used to query the
    Perl paths.
    * Fixed a bug with the percent being possibly undefined in output.
    Added a regression test.

0.0102    Wed Nov 15 22:18:10 IST 2006

    release.
    * Bumped the version number.

0.0101    Wed Nov  1 21:43:36 IST 2006
    * Fixed the error indicator in the call to
    _handle_test_file_closing_error() - $! instead of $1.
    * Added more POD for web resources of the module.
    * Added an example for integrating Test::Run into an EU::MM and
    Test::Manifest setup.
    * Updated the TODO.
    * First non-Developer release!

0.0100_11 Fri Oct  6 18:28:07 IST 2006
    * Updated the documentation to Test::Run.
    * Adapted the code to TAPx::Parser 0.33.

0.0100_10 Thu Oct  5 12:19:09 IST 2006
    * Changed ($self,%args) = @_ into ($self,$args) = @_ in the calling
    conventions of many functions.
    * Changed the interface of all the classes to this convention.
    * Extracted many methods and other refactorings.
    * Replaced Test::Run::Point and friends with TAPx::Parser
    * Added a Build.PL file (with enabled Test::Run::Builder, to test
    using Test::Run).
    * Changed most exception throwing to either throwing an object, (if
    a test fails or so) or Carp::confess (in case the programmer does something
    wrong) for better debugability.
    * A lot of refactoring of Test::Run::Straps.
    * Added several tests for the output of tests' outcomes.
    * Moved all the ->output()'s outputs to a separate plugin
    (Test::Run::Plugin::CmdLine::Output), and moved the rest of the core
    functionality to Test::Run::Core.
    * Converted the strap handlers to be methods of Test::Run::Core, and
    the callback to be a closure that calls its method.

0.0100_09 Sat May 13 11:56:41 IDT 2006
    * Extracted the _get_fail_test_scripts_string() and
    _get_fail_tests_good_percent_string() methods out of
    _get_fail_other_exception_text() methods for easy overriding, and
    implementing the error line customization plugins.

0.0100_08 Sat Apr  8 18:39:28 IDT 2006
    * A refactoring of _handle_runtests_error(), which would allow an
    easier coding of Plugin::ColorSummary.
    * Added Scalar::Util to the Makefile.PL's "PREREQ_PM" and removed a
    redundant statement.

0.0100_07 Mon Mar 13 19:08:21 IST 2006
    * Changed "die $mystring"'s to "die $obj_ref"'s.
    * Removed many global variables and use of %ENV variables. Using
    accessors instead now.
    * Added several tests including some for regression bugs that
      were resolved.
    * Added output.t to the MANIFEST.
    * Added a README.

0.0100_06 Tue Nov 29 22:40:08 IST 2005
    * Fixed the bug where "All tests successful." was displayed as
    "All tests successful0.". Added an appropriate test.
    * Eliminated the unnecessary warning on the Pod::Usage in the
    Makefile.PL of Test::Run. Now it just doesn't install prove.
    * Moved two test scripts that are depenedent on prove (or exit on its
    non-installation), to a temporary location to be restored when
    Test::Run::CmdLine is in better shape.
    * Some refactorings.
        - Added the Test::Run::Obj::Error module for throwing errors. Moved
        one FAILED report to it, and change Run::Obj to be compatible with
        some refactoring in the way.
    * Added a TODO File.
    * Fix a problem with a missing comma in the output of Test::Run when
    there are skipped subtests.

0.0100_05 Sat Nov 09 21:00:00 IST 2005
    * Renamed to Test::Run

0.0100_04 Sat Nov 05 23:53:00 IST 2005
    * Lots of cleanups to the code - including some internal interface changes.
        - Method extractions, refactorings.
        - Created a base class for structs - i.e: objects that are meant
        to mostly contain only specific fields.
        - Converted several hashes to such structs and am using their
        accessors instead of their vanilla hash elements.
    * Removed the dependency on Test::Harness. Now the module is standalone.

0.0100_03 Tue Nov 01 14:57:27 IST 2005
    * Fixed a documentation problem with the test_files passed as an argument
    to runtests.
    * Added a test to test against the presence of the per-test-file
    statistics report. (implemented using formats for the time being.)
    * Eliminated the use of formats in the fail_other report(). Made a lot
    of refactoring up to the point.

0.0100_02 Mon Oct 31 00:37:26 IST 2005
    * Changed the string Test::Harness to Test::Shlomif::Harness in
    Test::Shlomif::Harness::Straps.

Backports from Test::Harness to Test::Shlomif::Harness:

2.56 Wed Sep 28 16:04:00 CDT 2005
    [FIXES]
    * Incorporate bleadperl patch to fix Test::Harness on VMS.

Revision history for Perl extension Test::Harness

2.53_02 Thu Aug 25 21:37:01 CDT 2005
    [FIXES]
    * File order in prove is now sorted within the directory.  It's not
      the sorting that's important as much as the deterministic results.
      Thanks to Adam Kennedy and Casey West for pointing this out,
      independently of each other, with 12 hours of the other.

    [INTERNALS]
    * Fix calls to podusage() to not use the DATA typeglob.  Thanks sungo.

2.53_01 Sun Jul 10 10:45:27 CDT 2005
    [FIXES]
    * If we go over 100,000 tests, it used to print out a warning for
      every test over 100,000.  Now, we stop after the first.  Thanks to
      Sebastien Aperghis-Tramoni.

2.52 Sun Jun 26 23:05:19 CDT 2005
    No changes

2.51_02
    [ENHANCEMENTS]
    * The Test::Harness timer is now off by default.  Set HARNESS_TIMER
      true if you want it.  Added --timer flag to prove.

2.50_01
    [FIXES]
    * Call CORE::time() to figure out if we should print when we're
      printing once per second.  Otherwise, we're using Time::HiRes'
      version of it.  Thanks, Nicholas Clark.

2.50 Tue Jun 21 14:32:12 CDT 2005
    [FIXES]
    * Added some includes in t/strap-analyze.t to make Cygwin happy.

2.49_02 Tue Jun 21 09:54:44 CDT 2005
    [FIXES]
    * Added some includes in t/test_harness.t to make Cygwin happy.

2.49_01 Fri Jun 10 15:37:31 CDT 2005
    [ENHANCEMENTS]
    * Now shows elapsed time in 1000ths of a second if Time::HiRes
      is available.

    [FIXES]
    * Test::Harness::Iterator didn't have a 1; at the end.  Thanks to
      Steve Peters for finding it.

2.48    Fri Apr 22 22:41:46 CDT 2005
    Released after weeks of non-complaint.

2.47_03 Wed Mar  2 16:52:55 CST 2005
    [THINGS THAT MIGHT BREAK YOUR CODE]
    * Test::Harness now requires Perl 5.005_03 or above.

    [FIXES]
    * Fixed incorrect "confused by tests in wrong order" error in 2.47_02.

2.47_02 Tue Mar  1 23:15:47 CST 2005
    [THINGS THAT MIGHT BREAK YOUR CODE]
    * Test directives for skip tests used to be anything that matches
      /^skip/i, like the word "skipped", but now it must match
      /^skip\s+/i.

    [ENHANCEMENTS]
    * T::H now sets environment variable HARNESS_VERSION, in case a test
      program wants to know what version of T::H it's running under.

2.47_01 Mon Feb 21 01:14:13 CST 2005
    [FIXES]
    * Fixed a problem submitted by Craig Berry:

        Several of the Test::Harness tests now fail on VMS with the
        following warning:

        Can't find string terminator "]" anywhere before EOF at -e line 1.

        The problem is that when a command is piped to the shell and that
        command has a newline character embedded in it, the part after
        the newline is invisible to the shell. The patch below corrects
        that by escaping the newline so it is not subject to variable
        interpolation until it gets to the child's Perl one-liner.

    [ENHANCEMENTS]
    * Test::Harness::Straps now has diagnostic gathering without changing
      how tests are run.  It also adds these messages by default.
      Note that the new method, _is_diagnostic(), is for internal
      use only.  It may change soon.  Thanks to chromatic.

    [DOCUMENTATION]
    * Expanded Test::Harness::TAP.pod, and added examples.

    * Fixed a crucial documentation typo in Test::Harness::Straps.

2.46    Thu Jan 20 11:50:59 CST 2005
    Released.

2.45_02 Fri Dec 31 14:57:33 CST 2004
    [ENHANCEMENTS]
    * Turns off buffering on both STDERR and STDOUT, so that the two
      output handles don't get out of sync with each other.  Thanks to
      David Wheeler.

    * No longer requires, or supports, the HARNESS_OK_SLOW environment
      variable.  Test counts are only updated once per second, which
      used to require having HARNESS_OK_SLOW set.

2.45_01 Fri Dec 17 22:39:17 CST 2004
    [THINGS THAT MIGHT BREAK YOUR CODE]
    * Test::Harness now requires Perl 5.004_05.

    * We no longer try to print a stack if a coredump is detected.

    [FIXES]
    * Reverted Test::Harness::Iterator::next()'s use of readline, since
      it fails under Perl 5.5.4.

    * We no longer try to print a stack if a coredump is detected.
      This means that the external problems we've had with wait.ph
      now disappear.  This resolves a number of problems that various
      Linux distros have, and closes a couple of RT tickets like #2729
      and #7716.

    [ENHANCEMENTS]
    * Added Test::Harness->strap() method to access the internal strap.

    [DOCUMENTATION]
    * Obfuscated the rt.cpan.org email address.  The damage is already
      done, but at least we'll have it hidden going forward.

2.44 Tue Nov 30 18:38:17 CST 2004
    [INTERNALS]
    * De-anonymized the callbacks and handlers in Test::Harness, mostly
      so I can profile better.

    * Checks _is_header() only if _is_line() fails first.  No point
      in checking every line of the input for something that can only
      occur once.

    * Inline the _detailize() function, which was getting called once
      per line of input.  Reduced execution time about 5-7%.

    * Removed unnecessary temporary variables in Test::Harness::Straps
      and in Test::Harness::Iterator.

2.43_02 Thu Nov 25 00:20:36 CST 2004
    [ENHANCEMENTS]
    * Added more debug output if $Test::Harness::Debug is on.

    [FIXES]
    * Test::Harness now removes default paths from the paths that it
      sets in PERL5LIB.  This fixes RT #5649.  Thanks, Schwern.

    [THINGS THAT MIGHT BREAK YOUR CODE]
    * Test::Harness::Straps' constructor no longer will work as an
      object method.  You can't say $strap->new any more, but that's
      OK because you never really wanted to anyway.

2.43_01
    [FIXES]
    * Added workaround for local $ENV{} bug on Cygwin to
    t/prove-switches.t.  See the following RT tickets for details.

    [ENHANCEMENTS]
    * prove -v now sets TEST_VERBOSE in case your tests rely on them.
    * prove globs the command line, since Win32's shell doesn't.

    [FIXES]
    * Cross-platform test fixes on t/prove-globbing.t


2.40        Tue Dec 30 20:38:59 CST 2003
    [FIXES]
    * Test::Harness::Straps should now properly quote on VMS.

    [ENHANCEMENTS]
    * prove now takes a -l option to add lib/ to @INC.  Now when you're
      building a module, you don't have to do a make before you run
      the prove.  Thanks to David Wheeler for the idea.

    [INTERNALS]
    * Internal functions corestatus() and canonfailed() prepended with
      underscores, to indicate such.

    * Gratuitous text-only changes in Test::Harness::Iterator.

    * All tests now do their use_ok() in a BEGIN block.  Some of the
      use_ok() calls were too much of a hassle to put into a BEGIN block,
      so I changed them to regular use calls.


2.38        Mon Nov 24 22:36:18 CST 2003
    Released.  See changes below.

2.37_03     Tue Nov 18 23:51:38 CST 2003
    [ENHANCEMENTS]
    * prove -V now shows the Perl version being used.
    * Now there's a HARNESS_DEBUG flag that shows diagnostics as the
      harness runs the tests.  This is different from HARNESS_VERBOSE,
      which shows test output, but not information about the harness
      itself.
    * Added _command_line() to the Strap API.

    [FIXES]
    * Bad interaction with Module::Build:  The strap was only checking
      $ENV{HARNESS_PERL_SWITCHES} for definedness, but not emptiness.
      It now also strips any leading or trailing whitesapce from the
      switches.
    * Test::Harness and prove only quote those parms that actually need
      to be quoted: Have some whitespace and aren't already quoted.

2.36        Fri Nov 14 09:24:44 CST 2003
    [FIXES]
    * t/prove-includes.t properly ignores PROVE_SWITCHES that you may
      already have set.

2.35_02     Thu Nov 13 09:57:36 CST 2003
    [ENHANCEMENTS]
    * prove's --blib now works just like the blib pragma.

2.35_01     Wed Nov 12 23:08:45 CST 2003
    [FIXES]
    * Fixed taint-handling and path preservation under MacOS.  Thanks to
      Schwern for the patch and the tests.

    * Preserves case of -t or -T in the shebang line of the test.

    [ENHANCEMENTS]
    * Added -t to prove analogous to Perl's -t.  Removed the --taint
      switch.

    * prove can take default options from the PROVE_SWITCHES variable.

    * Added HARNESS_PERL to allow you to specify the Perl interpreter
      to run the tests as.

    * prove's --perl switch sets the HARNESS_PERL on the fly for you.

    * Quotes the switches and filename in the subprogram.  This helps
      with filenames with spaces that are subject to shell mangling.


2.34        Sat Nov  8 22:09:15 CST 2003
    [FIXES]
    * Allowed prove to run on Perl versions < 5.6.0.

    [ENHANCEMENTS]
    * Command-line switches to prove may now be stacked.
    * Added check for proper Pod::Usage version.
    * "make clean" does a better job of cleaning up after itself.


2.32        Fri Nov  7 09:41:21 CST 2003
    Test::Harness now includes a powerful development tool to help
    programmers work with automated tests.  The prove utility runs
    test files against the harness, like a "make test", but with many
    advantages:

    * prove is designed as a development tool
        Perl users typically run the test harness through a makefile via
        "make test". That's fine for module distributions, but it's
        suboptimal for a test/code/debug development cycle.

    * prove is granular
        prove lets your run against only the files you want to check.
        Running "prove t/live/ t/master.t" checks every *.t in t/live, plus
        t/master.t.

    * prove has an easy verbose mode
        To get full test program output from "make test", you must set
        "HARNESS_VERBOSE" in the environment. prove has a "-v" option.

    * prove can run under taint mode
        prove's "-T" runs your tests under "perl -T".

    * prove can shuffle tests
        You can use prove's "--shuffle" option to try to excite problems
        that don't show up when tests are run in the same order every time.

    * Not everything is a module
        More and more users are using Perl's testing tools outside the
        context of a module distribution, and may not even use a makefile at
        all.

    Prove requires Pod::Usage, which is standard after Perl 5.004.

    I'm very excited about prove, and hope that developers will begin
    adopting it to their coding cycles.  I welcome your comments at
    andy@petdance.com.

    There are also some minor bug fixes in Test::Harness itself, listed
    below in the 2.31_* notes.


2.31_05     Thu Nov  6 14:56:22 CST 2003
    [FIXES]
    - If a MacPerl script had a shebang with -T, the -T wouldn't get
      passed as a switch.
    - Removed the -T on three *.t files, which didn't need them, and
      which were causing problems.
    - Conditionally installs bin/prove, depending on whether Pod::Usage
      is available, which prove needs.
    - Removed old leftover code from Makefile.PL.

2.31_04     Mon Nov  3 23:36:06 CST 2003
    Minor tweaks here and there, almost ready to release.

2.31_03     Mon Nov  3 08:50:36 CST 2003
    [FEATURES]
    - prove is almost feature-complete.  Removed the handling of
      --exclude for excluding certain tests.  It may go back in the
      future.
    - prove -d is now debug.  Dry is prove -D.

2.31_02     Fri Oct 31 23:46:03 CST 2003
    [FEATURES]
    - Added many more switches to prove: -d for dry run, and -b for
      blib.

    [FIXES]
    - T:H:Straps now recognizes MSWin32 in $^0.
    - RT#3811: Could do regex matching on garbage in _is_test().
      Fixed by Yves Orton
    - RT#3827: Strips backslashes from and normalizes @INC entries
      for Win32.  Fixed by Yves Orton.

    [INTERNALS]
    - Added $self->{_is_macos} to the T:H:Strap object.
    - t/test-harness.t sorts its test results, rather than relying on
      internal key order.

2.31_01
    [FEATURES]
    - Added "prove" script to run a test or set of tests through the
      harness.  Thanks to Curtis Poe for the foundation.

    [DOCUMENTATION]
    - Fixed POD problem in Test::Harness::Assert

2.30        Thu Aug 14 20:04:00 CDT 2003
    No functional changes in this version.  It's only to make some doc
    tweaks, and bump up the version number in T:H:Straps.

    [DOCUMENTATION]
    - Changed Schwern to Andy as the maintainer.
    - Incorporated the TODO file into Harness.pm proper.
    - Cleaned up formatting in Test::Harness::Straps.

2.29        Wed Jul 17 14:08:00 CDT 2003
    - Released as 2.29.

2.28_91     Sun Jul 13 00:10:00 CDT 2003
    [ENHANCEMENTS]
    - Added support for HARNESS_OK_SLOW.  This will make a significant
      speedup for slower connections.
    - Folded in some changes from bleadperl that spiff up the
      failure reports.

    [INTERNALS]
    - Added some isa_ok() checks to the tests.
    - All Test::Harness* modules are used by use_ok()
    - Fixed the prototype for the canonfailed() function, not that
      it matters since it's never called without parens.

2.28_90     Sat Jul 05 20:21:00 CDT 2003
    [ENHANCEMENTS]
    - Now, when you run a test harnessed, the numbers don't fly by one
      at a time, one update per second.  This significantly speeds
      up the run time for running thousands of tests.  *COUGH*
      Regexp::Common *COUGH*

2.28     Thu Apr 24 14:39:00 CDT 2003
    - No functional changes.

2.27_05  Mon Apr 21 15:55:00 CDT 2003
    - No functional changes.
    - Fixed circular depency in the test suite.  Thanks, Rob Brown.

2.27_04  Sat Apr 12 21:42:00 CDT 2003
    - Added test for $Test::Harness::Switches patch below.

2.27_03  Thu Apr 03 10:47:00 CDT 2003
    - Fixed straps not respecting $Test::Harness::Switches.  Thanks
      to Miyagawa for the patch.
    - Added t/pod.t to test POD validity.

2.27_02  Mon Mar 24 13:17:00 CDT 2003
2.27_01  Sun Mar 23 19:46:00 CDT 2003
    - Handed over to Andy Lester for further maintenance.
    - Fixed when the path to perl contains spaces on Windows
    * Stas Bekman noticed that tests with no output at all were
      interpreted as passing
    - MacPerl test tweak for busted exit codes (bleadperl 17345)
    - Abigail and Nick Clark both hit the 100000 "huge test that will
      suck up all your memory" limit with legit tests.  Made the check
      smarter to allow large, planned tests to work.
    - Partial fix of stats display when a test fails only because there's
      too many tests.
    - Made wait.ph and WCOREDUMP anti-vommit protection more robust in
      cases where wait.ph loads but WCOREDUMP() pukes when run.
    - Added a LICENSE.
    - Ilya noticed the per test skip reason was accumlating between tests.

2.26  Wed Jun 19 16:58:02 EDT 2002
    - Workaround for MacPerl's lack of a working putenv.  It will never
      see the PERL5LIB environment variable (perl@16942).

2.25  Sun Jun 16 03:00:33 EDT 2002
    - $Strap is now a global to allow Test::Harness::Straps
      experimentation.
    - Little spelling nit in a diagnostic.
    - Chris Richmond noted that the runtests() docs were wrong.  It will
      die, not return false, when any tests fail.  This is silly, but
      historically necessary for 'make test'.  Docs corrected.
    - MacPerl test fixes from Pudge. (mutation of bleadperl@16989)
    - Undef warning introduced in 2.24 on skipped tests with no reasons
      fixed.
    * Test::Harness now depends on File::Spec

2.24  Wed May 29 19:02:18 EDT 2002
    * Nikola Knezevic found a bug when tests are completely skipped
      but no reason is given it was considered a failure.
    * Made Test::Harness::Straps->analyze_file & Test::Harness a bit
      more graceful when the test doesn't exist.

2.23  Wed May 22 12:59:47 EDT 2002
    - reason for all skip wasn't being displayed.  Broken in 2.20.
    - Changed the wait status tests to conform with POSIX standards.
    - Quieted some SYSTEM$ABORT noise leaking out from dying test tests
      on VMS.

2.22  Fri May 17 19:01:35 EDT 2002
    - Fixed parsing of #!/usr/bin/perl-current to not see a -t.
      (RT #574)
    - Fixed exit codes on MPE/iX

2.21  Mon May  6 00:43:22 EDT 2002
    - removed a bunch of dead code left over after 2.20's gutting.
    - The fix for the $^X "bug" added in 2.02 has been removed.  It
      caused more trouble than the old bug (I'd never seen a problem
      before anyway)
    - 2.20 broke $verbose

2.20  Sat May  4 22:31:20 EDT 2002
    * An almost complete conversion of the Test::Harness test parsing
      to use Test::Harness::Straps.

2.04  Tue Apr 30 00:54:49 EDT 2002
    * Changing the output format of skips
    - Taking into account VMS's special exit codes in the tests.

2.03  Thu Apr 25 01:01:34 EDT 2002
    * $^X fix made safer.
    - Noise from loading wait.ph to analyze core files supressed
    - MJD found a situation where a test could run Test::Harness
      out of memory.  Protecting against that specific case.
    - Made the 1..M docs a bit clearer.
    - Fixed TODO tests so Test::Harness does not display a NOK for
      them.
    - Test::Harness::Straps->analyze_file() docs were not clear as to
      its effects

2.02  Thu Mar 14 18:06:04 EST 2002
    * Ken Williams fixed the long standing $^X bug.
    * Added HARNESS_VERBOSE
    * Fixed a bug where Test::Harness::Straps was considering a test that
      is ok but died as passing.
    - Added the exit and wait codes of the test to the
      analyze_file() results.

2.01  Thu Dec 27 18:54:36 EST 2001
    * Added 'passing' to the results to tell you if the test passed
    * Added Test::Harness::Straps example (examples/mini_harness.plx)
    * Header-at-end tests were being interpreted as failing sometimes
    - The 'skip_all' results from analyze* was not being set
    - analyze_fh() and analyze_file() now work more efficiently, reading
      line-by-line instead of slurping as before.

2.00  Sun Dec 23 19:13:57 EST 2001
    - Fixed a warning on VMS.
    - Removed a little unnecessary code from analyze_file()
    - Made sure filehandles are getting closed
    - analyze() now considers "not \nok" to be a failure (VMSism)
      but Test::Harness still doesn't.

2.00_05 Mon Dec 17 22:08:02 EST 2001
    * Wasn't filtering @INC properly when a test is run with -T, caused the
      command line to be too long on VMS.  VMS should be 100% now.
    - Little bug in the skip 'various reasons' logic.
    - Minor POD nit in 5.004_04
    - Little speling mistak

2.00_04 Sun Dec 16 00:33:32 EST 2001
    * Major Test::Harness::Straps doc bug.

2.00_03 Sat Dec 15 23:52:17 EST 2001
    * First release candidate
    * 'summary' is now 'details'
    * Test #1 is now element 0 on the details array.  It works out better
      that way.
    * analyze_file() is more portable, but no longer taint clean
    * analyze_file() properly preserves @INC and handles -T switches
    - minor mistake in the test header line parsing

1.26  Mon Nov 12 15:44:01 EST 2001
    * An excuse to upload a new version to CPAN to get Test::Harness
      back on the index.

2.00_00  Sat Sep 29 00:12:03 EDT 2001
    * Partial gutting of the internals
    * Added Test::Harness::Straps

1.25  Tue Aug  7 08:51:09 EDT 2001
    * Fixed a bug with tests failing if they're all skipped
      reported by Stas Bekman.
    - Fixed a very minor warning in 5.004_04
    - Fixed displaying filenames not from @ARGV
    - Merging with bleadperl
    -  minor fixes to the filename in the report
    -  '[no reason given]' skip reason

1.24  Tue Aug  7 08:51:09 EDT 2001
    - Added internal information about number of todo tests

1.23  Tue Jul 31 15:06:47 EDT 2001
    - Merged in Ilya's "various reasons" patch
    * Fixed "not ok 23 - some name # TODO" style tests

1.22  Mon Jun 25 02:00:02 EDT 2001
    * Fixed bug with failing tests using header at end.
    - Documented how Test::Harness deals with garbage input
    - Turned on test counter mismatch warning

1.21  Wed May 23 19:22:53 BST 2001
    * No longer considered unstable.  Merging back with the perl core.
    - Fixed minor nit about the report summary
    - Added docs on the meaning of the failure report
    - Minor POD nits fixed mirroring perl change 9176
    - TODO and SEE ALSO expanded

1.20  Wed Mar 14 23:09:20 GMT 2001 by Michael G Schwern    *UNSTABLE*
    * Fixed and tested with 5.004!
    - Added EXAMPLE docs
    - Added TODO docs
    - Now uneffected by -l, $\ or $,

1.19  Sat Mar 10 00:43:29 GMT 2001 by Michael G Schwern    *UNSTABLE*
    - More internal reworking
    * Removed use of experimental /(?>...)/ feature for backwards compat
    * Removed use of open(my $fh, $file) for backwards compatibility
    * Removed use of Tie::StdHandle in tests for backwards compat
    * Added dire warning that this is unstable.
    - Added some tests from the old CPAN release

1.18  Mon Mar  5 17:35:11 GMT 2001 by Michael G Schwern
    * Under new management!
    * Test::Harness is now being concurrently shipped on CPAN as well
      as in the core.
    - Switched "our" for "use vars" and moved the minimum version back
      to 5.004.  This may be optimistic.


*** Missing version history to be extracted from Perl changes ***


1.07  Fri Feb 23 1996 by Andreas Koenig
    - Gisle sent me a documentation patch that showed me, that the
      unless(/^#/) is unnessessary. Applied the patch and deleted the block
      checking for "comment" lines. -- All lines are comment lines that do
      not match /^1\.\.([0-9]+)/ or /^(not\s+)?ok\b/.
    - Ilyaz request to print "ok (empty test case)" whenever we say 1..0
      implemented.
    - Harness now doesn't abort anymore if we received confused test output,
      just warns instead.

1.05  Wed Jan 31 1996 by Andreas Koenig
    - More updates on docu and introduced the liberality that the script
      output may omit the test numbers.

1.03  Mon January 28 1996 by Andreas Koenig
    - Added the statistics for subtests. Updated the documentation.

1.02  by Andreas Koenig
    - This version reports a list of the tests that failed accompanied by
      some trivial statistics. The older (unnumbered) version stopped
      processing after the first failed test.
    - Additionally it reports the exit status if there is one.
