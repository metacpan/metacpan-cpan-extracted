#
# This is the name of the queue manager to which to connect in the
# tests.  
#
# If you don't support a client channel table file, and require the
# use of the MQSERVER environment variable to connect as a client, you
# need to set that environment variable *before* you run "make test".
#
# For example (ksh syntax, YMMV):
#
# export MQSERVER='SAT1/TCP/sasas12(16670)'
#
QUEUEMGR = YOURQM

#
# If you want the server tests to use the default queue manager
# (i.e. a blank string for the queue manager name), then set this
# parameter to 1
#
# USE_DEFAULT_QMGR = 1
USE_DEFAULT_QMGR = 0

#
# This is the queue to test against.  This is used in both the client
# and server tests.
#
QUEUE = PERL.MQI.TEST

#
# The Makefile.PL infrastructure does a decent job of figuring out
# that you can't support the server API (if you only have client
# libraries).  It does NOT figure out if you can't support the client
# API (if your site simply chooses not to support clients).
#
# These variables allow you to completely control the build of either
# the client or server API.  Note that if both end of being disabled,
# you'll get a loud complaint from Makefile.PL
#
# NOCLIENT = 1
# NOSERVER = 1
#

#
# NOTE: Most of the stuff below this point usually doesn't need to be
# changed, unless you have a non-standard installation (i.e. different
# pathnames) of the MQSeries product.
#

#
# This is the directory under which we can find the lib and inc (or
# include, for those of you who choose to standardize the directory
# name) directories of the MQSeries installation.  If this directory
# isn't found, or isn't specified, then it defaults to /opt/mqm (or
# /usr/lpp/mqm on AIX).
#
# MQMTOP = /ms/dist/3rd/PROJ/MQSeries/2.2.2
# MQMTOP = /ms/dist/3rd/PROJ/MQSeries/2.2.1/opt/mqm
# MQMTOP = /ms/dist/3rd/PROJ/MQSeries/5.0.7

#
# If you have installed the MQSeries locale files somewhere other than
# the operating system default location (e.g. on Solaris,
# /usr/lib/locale), then you can set this variable to the appropriate
# pathname, and the MQSeries.pm module will automatically set the
# NLSPATH environment variable for you.
#
# MQMLOCALE = /some/dir
