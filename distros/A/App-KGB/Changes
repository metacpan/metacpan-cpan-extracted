  [ Damyan Ivanov ]

    prev_status is undefined in such situations

1.56 2020-03-22
  [ Iain Lane ]
  * kgb-bot: Support globs in only_branches.
    This will allow derivatives to maintain their packages on Salsa, but not
    announce the changes to their branches to the Debian IRC channels.
    (Closes: #945015)
  * kgb-bot: Add only_tag parameter.
    As with `only_branch`, this will make the bot only announce changes to

    Thanks to James Clarke for the suggestion.

  [ Damyan Ivanov ]
  * kgb-bot: convert ::ffff:a.b.c.d to a.b.c.d before looking up client ip in
    the white list

1.53 2018-10-13
  [ Damyan Ivanov ]
  * drop port: option from default config
  * add port to the test server IRC config now that 6697 us the default
  * encode/decode Git directory name when passing it to Git or when reading it
    from the environment
    this matters when the directory name is not plain ASCII (Closes: #822375)
  * auto join: increase NickServ delay to 60 seconds (default is 5)
    this helps joining +r channels on freenode, where nick server identification
    takes more than 5 seconds
  * fix path to scripts in t/critic.t
  * reorder default notification order, keeping the order of colours
    the new order is project/module, branch, commit, author, log
  * Client::Git: strip leading whitespace when parsing the output of
    'git status'

  [ gregor herrmann ]
  * kgb-bot: human_duration(): also handle case where there are exactly
    two time parts. Thanks to Mattia Rizzolo for the bug report on IRC.

  [ Damyan Ivanov ]

    simple existence test is enough (Closes: #900699)

1.50 2018-05-23
  [ Martina Ferrari ]
  * Add merge request title to merge request notifications.
  * Stop using channel as a unique identifier.
    This is a big change, as most of the code was assuming a channel name is
    unique across networks, causing weird issues when adding channels
    dynamically from a webhook.
  * Factor out some repetitive code.
  * The current code was leaving the configuration in a inconsistent state when
    a channel was dynamically added; now it is done as if it was added to the
    configuration.
  * Finally fix the dynamic join problem.

  [ Damyan Ivanov ]
  * use get_chanid at one more place instead of hand-crafted concatenation
  * when complaining of a repo without channels, suggest adding them to
    the request parameters

  * fix 52-client-git.t and 53-client-git-merges.t with Git 1.17.
    (Closes: 894775)

  [ Colin Finck ]
  * Git client: Support an "author-via" placeholder in the message template,
    which shows the author and committer name if both are different.

1.46 2018-03-08
  [ Damyan Ivanov ]
  * webhook/push: add always_squash_branch parameter, 
    defaults to [ 'upstream', 'upstream/master' ]
  * fix stats counting
  * bot: reload URL shortening module when the config is changed
  * document short_url_service in kgb.conf(5)

  [ James Clarke ]

    (multiple values)
    (Closes: #891870)
  * webhook: colorize pipeline success/failure in reverse green/red

1.43 2018-03-02
  [ Damyan Ivanov ]
  * improve pipeline notifications
  * improve commit squash handling

1.42 2018-02-26
  [ Martina Ferrari ]
  * Speed-up KGB joining of channels and setup.
    Monkey-patch the delayed command dispatcher in PoCO::IRC to ignore
    flood-prevention measures for high-priority messages (JOIN, MODE, etc), now
    joins of many channels can be completed in a few seconds.

  [ Damyan Ivanov ]

  [ gregor herrmann ]
  * WWW::Shorten::Debli: use https for deb.li URLs.
    Thanks to pabs for the pointer.

  [ Damyan Ivanov ]
  * use the interpreter running the test to run the test client
    otherwise the system-wide perl is used, which may be configured
    (e.g. @INC) quite differently
    Thanks to Slaven Rezić (RT#108400)
  * fix comparison of Git version to 2.9.0, when the minor version is greater t»
    "2.15.0" ge "2.9.0" returns false, because it uses string comparison

    full name (Closes: #769239 -- FTBFS)

  [ gregor herrmann ]
  * kgb-client.conf(5): change example shortening service from Metamark to
    TinyURL, following the example of WWW::Shorten. Metamark is not
    accepting new URLs anymore.

  [ Damyan Ivanov ]
  * also mention cgit in the web-link description
  * add a new script, kgb-ci-report. used to notify about CI failures

    configuration (already removed from the single-line configuration)
    Closes: #772749
  * Fix multiline message template
    Closes: #772750

  [ Damyan Ivanov ]
  * TestBot:
    - when waiting for the PID file to appear, also see if it has any content
    - close the PID file after reading it
  * kgb-bot:
    - add the PID to the "Listening on ..." line in the log
    - rewrite the PID management code using OO interface of Proc::PID::File.
      This fixes a rather nasty hardly-reproducible bug causing the PID file
      to be re-created after being removed, which may fool the tests and make
      them hang.
      Closes: #782079

  [ gregor herrmann ]
  * Build.PL:
    - install new kgb-ci-report script
    - add DBD::Pg as requirement in Build.PL
  * Fix some typos in the POD. Thanks to lintian.

  [ Martina Ferrari ]
  * App::KGB::Client::ServerRef:
    - More consistent verbose reporting of server communication.
    - Add --dry-run option for debugging.
    - Bug fix: use correct method when sending a commit info with
      default protocol.
  * App::KGB::Client: format_message: Don't lose data.
    When the commit object does not have all the info, it still overwrites
    data coming from the extra arguments. It meant SVN commits were lacking
    branch and module information completely.

  [ gregor herrmann ]
  * Fix t/52-client-git.t to work with newer git versions as well.
    Since 2.9.0, git allows merging branches without a common ancestors only
    when "--allow-unrelated-histories" is passed. This has lead to test
    failures.
    Pass the parameter conditionally.


1.33 2014-08-06
