0.01  Sat Jan  1 11:35:09 AST 2011
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.23 with options
		-A -n Device::Blkid::E2fsprogs

0.10  Tue Jan  4 00:13:24 AST 2011
	- Moving this to version 0.10 after some feverish cleaning
        - Package builds, POD is semi-release worthy
        - Ready for upload on CPAN now as a developer release
        - still requires test script completion

        - Cleaned up POD typos, finished documenting all functions
        - Added last two function wrappers
                - blkid_get_library_version()
                - blkid_parse_tag_string()
        - Have switched undef return types in object creation functions to
          instead throw exceptions. This happens when the cache, device and
          two iterator objects are requested from the lib.

          define used to conditionally compile a version specific target of this package
        - Modified Makefile.PL to work with changes to Devel::CheckLib to support targeted module versions

          device rather than a POSIX file descriptor to achieve a more Perlish interface

          allocation.
