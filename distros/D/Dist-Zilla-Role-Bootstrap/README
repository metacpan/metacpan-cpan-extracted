Dist::Zilla::Role::Bootstrap

This module is a role that aims to be consumed by plugins that want to
perform some very early bootstrap operation that may affect the loading
environment of successive plugins, especially with regards to plugins
that may wish to build with themselves, either by consuming the source
tree itself, or by consuming a previous built iteration.

Implementation is quite simple:

1. "with" this role in your plugin
      with 'Dist::Zilla::Role::Bootstrap'

2. Implement the "bootstrap" sub.
      sub bootstrap {
        my ( $self ) = @_;
      }

3. *Optional*: Fetch the discovered "bootstap" root via:
      $self->_bootstap_root

4. *Optional*: Load some path into @INC via:
      $self->_add_inc($path)
