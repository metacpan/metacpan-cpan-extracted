Revision history for Perl extension File::DirSync.

1.22  Wed Aug 15 15:30:00 2007
	- Allow gentleness to pause even right in the
	  middle of a chewing copy since that can be
	  very painful to the drive.

1.21  Thu Aug 09 22:00:00 2007
	- Tweak minimum thresholds for autoincrease
	  in order to provide more granular throttling.
	- Fix initial gentle_ops boundary checking.
	- Clear up a few warnings.

1.20  Wed Aug 08 15:05:00 2007
	- Stable release
	- Just bug fixes from v1.16.
	- More accurate gentle throttling computation
	  w/ on-the-fly auto-adjust disk ops feature.
	- Versions v1.17 - v1.19 were beta tests.

1.16  Sat Aug 04 02:00:00 2007
	- Disable operation tracking by default.
	- Add a proctitle feature for progress monitioring.
	- Moved rmtree and copy routines directly into this
	  module for performance purposes.
	- Add "gentle" feature to allow dirsync to throttle
	  back the IO on the disks if this is desired.

1.15  Fri Jul 14 09:58:00 2006
	- Avoid forcing directory timestamp to match a
	  more future mtime of a symlink within it.
	  This allows to cleanly detect and revert any
	  changes made on the destination by simply
	  running a rebuild on it (as well as the source)
	  prior to executing the dirsync operation.
	  Altering a symlink in any way will ALWAYS
	  update the mtime of the containing directory
	  inode, so this is most correct anyway.

1.14  Tue Apr 18 17:46:00 2006
	- Add maxskew feature to avoid cache corruption.
	- Add t/110_behave.t tester.

1.12  Tue Mar 23 17:00:00 2004
	- Autoflush STDOUT if verbose is enabled.
	- Force chmod to match for directories too.
	- Reference the commandline utility in SEE ALSO.
	- Rid the spec since cpan2rpm handles is fine.
