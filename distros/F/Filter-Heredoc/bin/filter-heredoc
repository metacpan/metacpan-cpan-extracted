filter-heredoc - Search and filter embedded here documents

=head1 SYNOPSIS

filter-heredoc [B<--debug>] [B<--interactive>] [B<--list>] 
    [B<--list-unique>] [B<--match>=I<delimiter>] [B<--quiet>] 
    [B<--rules>] [B<--syntax>=I<rule>] [B<--version>] I<input>
    
filter-heredoc B<--help>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<filter-heredoc> search and extracts here documents from POSIX
IEEE Std 1003.1-2008 compliant shell scripts and is the front-end
for L<Filter::Heredoc>.

B<filter-heredoc> input is given by the I<input> text file.
If I<input> isn't given, it defaults to C<STDIN>. The extracted heredoc
is written to C<STDOUT>. Several files can be processed in the same
B<filter-heredoc> invocation by providing multiple of I<input> files
or wild cards on the command line.

B<--list> and B<--list-unique> can be used to find what delimiters
exist in the I<input> file. When B<--match>=I<delimiter> is specified,
only lines that match the I<delimiter> region of the here document
is printed.

Perl and other scripting languages have derived a similar syntax as
POSIX but is at the same time different in many details.

B<--syntax>=I<rule> adds rules to enhance the here document extraction.
To list available rules, use B<--rules>. Perls simple to use markup
documentation language (i.e. POD) can be embedded in shell scripts in
the form of a here document (SEE ALSO). 

The option B<--quiet> removes printed file information when e.g. the
output is piped for spell checking in an external program such as
I<hunspell>, I<aspell> or I<ispell>.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<-d>, B<--debug>

Prints out the complete file with each line prefixed with a label
code to indicate what context B<filter-heredoc> has assigned it to.

B<S]> Source script line which is outside the here document region.

B<I]> Ingress line (i.e. the line with the opening I<delimiter>).

B<H]> Here document line which is printed (inside region).

B<E]> The line which have the closing I<delimiter>.

=item B<-h>, B<--help>

Print out usage information.

=item B<-i|->, B<--interactive>

Enter interactive mode. This is only used to debug B<filter-heredoc>
internals. To terminate this mode use Ctrl-D (*nix-like systems).

=item B<-l>, B<--list>

List all I<delimiters> in the I<input> file.

=item B<-u>, B<--list-unique>

List all unique I<delimiters> in the I<input> file.

=item B<-m> I<delimiter>, B<--match>=I<delimiter>

Print only the here documents that is enclosed by the specified
I<delimiter>.

=item B<-q>, B<--quiet>

By default, B<filter-heredoc> prepend the file name and the line
number before the here document line is printed, for each file
processed. This option suppress this information to reduce screen
clutter or when piping C<STDOUT> to an external program.

=item B<-r>, B<--rules>

Rules can be added to enhance extraction of here documents.

C<pod> is a helper rule when POD is embedded in shell scripts

If the word C<none> is given as a rule all rules are deactivated. 
The rule C<pod> is enabled by default. Perl scripts with embedded
here documents that uses a near POSIX like coding constructs may
print correct. A rule C<perl> is planned to address Perls
variations in syntax.

=item B<-v>, B<--version>

Display the version information.

=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

If B<filter-heredoc> fails with fatal errors, see I<Filter::Heredoc>
for information about what those errors might mean. Please, improve
B<filter-heredoc> by sending a Bug report and how to reproduce the error.

=head1 EXAMPLES

Prints the here document from files:

    filter-heredoc *.sh
    filter-heredoc --quiet < file.sh
    
Spell checking here documents with e.g. I<ispell>:
    
    cat file.sh | filter-heredoc --quiet | ispell -l

To spell check when multiple delimiters exist, find the delimiters:

    filter-heredoc --list file.sh
    
Now match the script verbatim output with option --match (-m):

    filter-heredoc -q -m END_MAIL file.sh | hunspell -d sv_SE -l

If POD text have been embedded it can be extracted with I<podspell>:
    
    podspell diskusage | aspell list -l en
    podspell diskusage | ispell -a | grep \&
