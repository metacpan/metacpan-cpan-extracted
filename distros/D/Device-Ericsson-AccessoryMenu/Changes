0.7	Monday 22nd September, 2003
	Fixed a packageing mistake - we weren't shipping 
	lib/Device/Ericsson/AccessoryMenu/Mouse.pm due to a glitch in
	MANIFEST.SKIP


0.6	Wednesday 25th June, 2003
	Rewrote everything to be stateful.  We now have a stack of
	states.  You can enter a new state, or exit and query the
	current state. The current state's handle method will be
	invoked for each line received by ->control

	It is expected that states will be based on, or at least
	implement the interface of Device::Ericsson::AccessoryMenu::State, 
 	and that they will be named Device::Ericsson::AccessoryMenu::$state.

	INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE moved send_menu over to Menu->on_enter

	reimplemented send_text as a thin shim around enter_state( 'Text' )

	implemented mouse_move as a similar shim

	worked over examples/remote to be much more functional


0.5	Thursday 14th June, 2003
	Initial CPAN release
