SYNOPSIS

        # in Mojolicious app
        sub startup {
            my $app = shift;
            …
    
            # load and configure
            $app->plugin('SecureCORS');
            $app->plugin('SecureCORS', { max_age => undef });

            $app->routes->to('cors.credentials'=>1);
    
            # set default CORS options for nested routes
            $r = $r->under(…, {'cors.origin' => '*'}, …);
    
            # set CORS options for this route (at least "origin" option must be
            # defined to allow CORS, either here or in parent routes)
            $r->get(…, {'cors.origin' => '*'}, …);
            $r->route(…)->to('cors.origin' => '*');
    
            # allow non-simple (with preflight) CORS on this route
            $r->cors(…);
    
            # create under to protect all nested routes
            $r = $app->routes->under_strict_cors('/resource');

DESCRIPTION

    Mojolicious::Plugin::SecureCORS is a plugin that allow you to configure
    Cross Origin Resource Sharing for routes in Mojolicious app.

    Implements this spec: http://www.w3.org/TR/2014/REC-cors-20140116/.

 SECURITY

    Don't use the lazy 'cors.origin'=>'*' for resources which should be
    available only for intranet or which behave differently when accessed
    from intranet - otherwise malicious website opened in browser running
    on workstation in intranet will get access to these resources.

    Don't use the lazy 'cors.origin'=>'*' for resources which should be
    available only from some known websites - otherwise other malicious
    website will be able to attack your site by injecting JavaScript into
    the victim's browser.

    Consider using under_strict_cors() - it won't "save" you but may helps.

INTERFACE

 CORS options

    To allow CORS on some route you should define relevant CORS options for
    that route. These options will be processed automatically using
    "after_render" in Mojolicious hook and result in adding corresponding
    HTTP headers to the response.

    Options should be added into default parameters for the route or it
    parent routes. Defining CORS options on parent route allow you to set
    some predefined defaults for their nested routes.

    'cors.origin' => '*'

    'cors.origin' => 'null'

    'cors.origin' => 'http://example.com'

    'cors.origin' => 'https://example.com http://example.com:8080 null'

    'cors.origin' => qr/\.local\z/ms

    'cors.origin' => undef (default)

      This option is required to enable CORS support for the route.

      Only matched origins will be allowed to process returned response
      ('*' will match any origin).

      When set to false value no origins will match, so it effectively
      disable CORS support (may be useful if you've set this option value
      on parent route).

    'cors.credentials' => 1

    'cors.credentials' => undef (default)

      While handling preflight request true/false value will tell browser
      to send or not send credentials (cookies, http auth, SSL certificate)
      with actual request.

      While handling simple/actual request if set to false and browser has
      sent credentials will disallow to process returned response.

    'cors.expose' => 'X-Some'

    'cors.expose' => 'X-Some, X-Other, Server'

    'cors.expose' => undef (default)

      Allow access to these headers while processing returned response.

      These headers doesn't need to be included in this option:

        Cache-Control
        Content-Language
        Content-Type
        Expires
        Last-Modified
        Pragma

    'cors.headers' => 'X-Requested-With'

    'cors.headers' => 'X-Requested-With, Content-Type, X-Some'

    'cors.headers' => qr/\AX-|\AContent-Type\z/msi

    'cors.headers' => undef (default)

      Define headers which browser is allowed to send. Work only for
      non-simple CORS because it require preflight.

    'cors.methods' => 'POST'

    'cors.methods' => 'GET, POST, PUT, DELETE'

      This option can be used only for cors() route. It's needed in complex
      cases when it's impossible to automatically detect CORS option while
      handling preflight - see below for example.

 cors

        $app->routes->cors(...);

    Accept same params as "route" in Mojolicious::Routes::Route.

    Add handler for preflight (OPTIONS) CORS request - it's required to
    allow non-simple CORS requests on given path.

    To be able to respond on preflight request this handler should know
    CORS options for requested method/path. In most cases it will be able
    to detect them automatically by searching for route defined for same
    path and HTTP method given in CORS request. Example:

        $r->cors('/rpc');
        $r->get('/rpc', { 'cors.origin' => 'http://example.com' });
        $r->put('/rpc', { 'cors.origin' => qr/\.local\z/ms });

    But in some cases target route can't be detected, for example if you've
    defined several routes for same path using different conditions which
    can't be checked while processing preflight request because browser
    didn't sent enough information yet (like Content-Type: value which will
    be used in actual request). In this case you should manually define all
    relevant CORS options on preflight route - in addition to CORS options
    defined on target routes. Because you can't know which one of defined
    routes will be used to handle actual request, in case they use
    different CORS options you should use combined in less restrictive way
    options for preflight route. Example:

        $r->cors('/rpc')->to(
            'cors.methods'      => 'GET, POST',
            'cors.origin'       => 'http://localhost http://example.com',
            'cors.credentials'  => 1,
        );
        $r->any([qw(GET POST)] => '/rpc',
            headers => { 'Content-Type' => 'application/json-rpc' },
        )->to('jsonrpc#handler',
            'cors.origin'       => 'http://localhost',
        );
        $r->post('/rpc',
            headers => { 'Content-Type' => 'application/soap+xml' },
        )->to('soaprpc#handler',
            'cors.origin'       => 'http://example.com',
            'cors.credentials'  => 1,
        );

    This route use "headers" condition, so you can add your own handler for
    OPTIONS method on same path after this one, to handle non-CORS OPTIONS
    requests on same path.

 under_strict_cors

        $route = $app->routes->under_strict_cors(...)

    Accept same params as "under" in Mojolicious::Routes::Route.

    Under returned route CORS requests to any route which isn't configured
    for CORS (i.e. won't have 'cors.origin' in route's default parameters)
    will be rendered as "403 Forbidden".

    This feature should make it harder to attack your site by injecting
    JavaScript into the victim's browser on vulnerable website. More
    details:

OPTIONS

    Mojolicious::Plugin::SecureCORS supports the following options.

 max_age

      $app->plugin('SecureCORS', { max_age => undef });

    Value for Access-Control-Max-Age: sent by preflight OPTIONS handler. If
    set to undef this header will not be sent.

    Default is 1800 (30 minutes).

METHODS

    Mojolicious::Plugin::SecureCORS inherits all methods from
    Mojolicious::Plugin and implements the following new ones.

 register

      $plugin->register(Mojolicious->new);
      $plugin->register(Mojolicious->new, { max_age => undef });

    Register hooks in Mojolicious application.
