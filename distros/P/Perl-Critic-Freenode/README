NAME

    Perl::Critic::Freenode - Perl::Critic policies inspired by #perl on
    freenode IRC

SYNOPSIS

      $ perlcritic --theme freenode script.pl
      $ perlcritic --theme freenode lib/
      
      # .perlcriticrc
      theme = freenode
      severity = 1

DESCRIPTION

    A set of Perl::Critic policies to enforce the practices generally
    recommended by the denizens of #perl on Freenode IRC
    <https://freenode.net/>. Because this policy "theme" is designed to be
    used with zero configuration on the command line, some duplication will
    occur if it is used in combination with core Perl::Critic policies.

AFFILIATION

    This module has no functionality, but instead contains documentation
    for this distribution and acts as a means of pulling other modules into
    a bundle. All of the Policy modules contained herein will have an
    "AFFILIATION" section announcing their participation in this grouping.
