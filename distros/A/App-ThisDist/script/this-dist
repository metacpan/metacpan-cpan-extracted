=head1 NAME

this-dist - Return name of Perl distribution associated with the current directory

=head1 VERSION

This document describes version 0.023 of this-dist (from Perl distribution App-ThisDist), released on 2024-01-06.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 % pwd
 /home/budi/perl-Foo-Bar

 % this-dist
 Foo-Bar

 # See how distribution is guessed
 % DEBUG=1 this-dist
 this-dist: Guessed dist=App-PPIUtils from dist.ini
 Foo-Bar

 # Will exit with code 1 and print error message to stderr when dist cannot be guessed
 % cd /
 % this-dist
 this-dist: No perl distribution name can be associated with current directory '/'

 # Don't show error message when guessing is failed (just exit with code 1)
 % this-dist -q
 % _

 # Also try to extract version
 % this-dist -V
 Foo-Bar 1.23

Some other examples:

 # Show MetaCPAN distribution page in browser (but see this-dist-on-metacpan script)
 % firefox metacpan.org/release/`this-dist`

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This script tries these methods when guessing Perl distribution name associated
with current directory:

=over

=item * Distribution metadata {MYMETA,META}.{json,yml}

=item * Makefile.PL, Makefile, Build.PL

=item * Name in F<dist.ini> (L<Dist::Zilla> configuration file), if the file is available

=back

If it cannot find an associated Perl
distribution name, it will print an error message to stderr (unless being told
to be quiet via C<--quiet>) and exit with non-zero status.

=head1 OPTIONS

=head2 --quiet, -q

=head2 --extract-version, -V

=head1 ENVIRONMENT

=head2 DEBUG

Bool. If set to true, will print debugging statement to stderr.

=head1 HOMEPAGE

=head1 SEE ALSO

L<dir2dist>

L<this-mod>

L<this-dist-on-metacpan>

Some scripts like L<pmman> and L<pmpath> (from L<App::PMUtils>) or
L<list-dist-contents> and L<dist-has-deb> (from L<App::DistUtils>) already
default to "current module" or "current distribution" so instead of saying:

 % dist-has-deb `this-dist`

you can just say:

 % dist-has-deb

=head1 CONTRIBUTING


To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull requests on
GitHub.

Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You can
simply modify the code, then test via:

 % prove -l

If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally on your
system), you can install L<Dist::Zilla>,
L<Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR>,
L<Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR>, and sometimes one or two other
Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps required beyond
that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.

Please report any bugs or feature requests on the bugtracker website L<https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Dist/Display.html?Name=App-ThisDist>

When submitting a bug or request, please include a test-file or a
patch to an existing test-file that illustrates the bug or desired
feature.
