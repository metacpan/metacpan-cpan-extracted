=head1 DESCRIPTION

Perl module inspired by https://github.com/github/scientist ( http://githubengineering.com/scientist/ )

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use feature qw(say);
  use Scientist;

  sub old_code {
    return 10;
  }

  sub new_code {
    return 20;
  }

  my $experiment = Scientist->new(
    experiment => 'MyTest',
    use => \&old_code,
    try => \&new_code,
  );

  my $answer = $experiment->run;

  say "The number ten is $answer";
  warn 'There was a mismatch between control and candidate'
    if $experiment->result->{'mismatched'};

  say 'Timings:';
  say 'Control code:   ', $experiment->result->{control}{duration}, ' microseconds';
  say 'Candidate code: ', $experiment->result->{candidate}{duration}, ' microseconds';

=head1 Introduction

This module is inspired by the Scientist ruby code released by GitHub under the MIT license in 2015/2016.

In February 2016, I started writing this Perl module to bring similar ideas to Perl.

Please get involved with this module. Contact lancew@cpan.org with ideas, suggestions; support, etc.

This code is also released under the MIT license to match the original Ruby implementation.

=head1 Methods / Attributes

=over

=item context(<HASHREF>)

Provide contextual information for the experiment; will be returned in the result set.

Should be a hashref.

=item enabled(<TRUE>|<FALSE>)

DEFAULT : TRUE

Boolean switch to enable or disable the experiment. If disabled the experiment will only return
the control code (use) result. The candidate code (try) will NOT be executed. The results set will
not be populated.

=item experiment(<STRING>)

DEFAULT : C<name()>'s output

Simply the name of the experiment included in the result set.

=item publish

Publish is a method called by C<-E<gt>run()>.

Scientist is designed so that you create your own personalised My::Scientist module and extend C<publish> to do what you want/need.
For example, to push timing and mismatch information to StatsD.

=item use(<CODEREF>)

Control code to be included in the experiment.

This code will be executed and returned when the experiment is run.

NB: This code is run and returned even if the experiment's C<enabled=false>.

=item result()

Result contains the result of the experiment after it is run.

Will contain data only AFTER C<-E<gt>run()> has been called.

Observation is included in the result, this includes matched/mismatched. If
there was a mismatch, then a diagnostic will be made available. This will
display what was expected (from the control) and what we got instead (from the
candidate).

=item run()

This method executes the control (use) code. If the experiment is C<enabled>, will also run the candidate (try)
code. The control and candidate code is run in random order.

=item try(<CODEREF>)

Candidate code to be included in the experiment.

This code will be executed and discarded when the experiment is run.

=item BUILD

This creates simply creates better column headers for the diagnostic output.

=back

=head1 Functions

=over

=item name(<STRING>)

DEFAULT : 'experiment'

The default string name of the experiment. Intended to be optionally overriden in a subclass.

=back

=head1 Extending Publish

You can create your own Scientist module and use it to create a custom publishing methodology.

Below is a small example that pushes mismatch info and timings to StatsD:

=head2 My/Scientist.pm

  package My::Scientist;
  use parent 'Scientist';

  use Net::Statsd;

  sub publish {
    my $self = shift;

    my $experiment = $self->result->{experiment};
    # Increment counter for every match or mismatch
    Net::Statsd::increment("$experiment.mismatch") if $self->result->{mismatched};
    Net::Statsd::increment("$experiment.match") unless $self->result->{mismatched};

    # Log timings (converting Scientist microsends to StatsD miliseconds)
    # Note: This implementation rounds down the duration.
    Net::Statsd::timing("$experiment.control",   int $self->result->{control}{duration} * 1_000);
    Net::Statsd::timing("$experiment.candidate", int $self->result->{candidate}{duration} * 1_000);
  }

  1;

=head2 SomePerlScript.pl

  use strict;
  use warnings;

  use My::Scientist;

  my $experiment = My::Scientist->new(
    experiment => 'MyTest',
    use        => \&old_code,
    try        => \&new_code,
  );

  my $result = $experiment->run;
