. Description:

	Version 0.1.3.

	Changed interface of all getargs() routines.  This change is
	NOT backward compatible, but this is the privilege of still
	being at the alpha stage...  Previous calls were made as:

	    getargs(\@_, ...)

	and must now be written as:

	    getargs (@_, ...)

	with an implicit reference being taken, via Perl prototyping.

	Added mention of similar module Params::Validate.  His author
	contacted me to mention it, and apparently we independently
	invented the same thing, albeit with slight different goals
	and interfaces.

	Added warning about interface change during the run of
	Makefile.PL if a previous incompatible version is detected.

	Updated all getargs() calls to new interface in the regression
	test suite.

. Description:

	Added warning when using perl 5.6.0.  Don't use that version
	of Perl.  Either use 5.005_03, or try 5.6.1.
