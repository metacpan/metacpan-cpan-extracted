NAME
    Mason - Powerful, high-performance templating for the web and beyond

SYNOPSIS
      foo.mc:
        % my $name = "Mason";
        Hello world! Welcome to <% $name %>.

      #!/usr/local/bin/perl
      use Mason;
      my $mason = Mason->new(comp_root => '...');
      print $mason->run('/foo')->output;

DESCRIPTION
    Mason is a powerful Perl-based templating system, designed to generate
    dynamic content of all kinds.

    Unlike many templating systems, Mason does not attempt to invent an
    alternate, "easier" syntax for templates. It provides a set of syntax
    and features specific to template creation, but underneath it is still
    clearly and proudly recognizable as Perl.

    Mason is most often used for generating web pages. It has a companion
    web framework, Poet, designed to take maximum advantage of its routing
    and content generation features. It can also be used as the templating
    layer for web frameworks such as Catalyst and Dancer.

    All documentation is indexed at Mason::Manual.

    The previous major version of Mason (1.x) is available under the name
    HTML::Mason.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
    Thanks to Stevan Little and the Moose team for the awesomeness of Moose,
    which motivated me to create a second version of Mason years after I
    thought I was done.

    Thanks to Tatsuhiko Miyagawa and the PSGI/Plack team, who freed me from
    ever worrying about server backends again.
