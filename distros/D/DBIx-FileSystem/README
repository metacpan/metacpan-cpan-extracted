DBIx::FileSystem - Manage database tables like a filesystem

DESCRIPTION:
------------

from the manpage:

The module DBIx::FileSystem offers you a filesystem like view to
database tables. To interact with the database tables, FileSystem
implements a command line shell which offers not only a subset of well
known shell commands to navigate, view and manipulate data in tables, but
also gives the convenience of history, command line editing and tab
completion. FileSystem sees the database as a filesystem: each
table is a different directory with the tablename as the directory
name and each row in a table is a file within that directory. 

DBIx::FileSystem also contains a class to access the data in the
Database. The function get_conf_by_var() respects the defaultfile
function from the shell.

The motivation for FileSystem was the need for a terminal based
configuration interface to manipulate database entries which are used
as configuration data for a server process. FileSystem is neither
complete nor a replacement for dbish or other full-feature SQL shells
or editors. Think of FileSystem as a replacement for a Web/CGI based
graphical user interface for manipulating database contents.

EXAMPLE:
--------

The file pawactl implements a sample shell using DBIx::FileSystem. It 
implements the configure shell of a virtual package warehouse. 
Sample session:

----------> pawactl sample session start --------->

  pawactl (/source): ls
  (dest)          acity           factory2        lcity           
  (source)        bcity           generic         
  (warehouse)     factory1        kcity           
  pawactl (/source): cat bcity 
  #
  # Settings for SourceName 'bcity' (defaults: 'generic')
  #
  # - this is a comment, comments always start in the first column.
  # - all lines begin in the first column or are blank lines
  # - a unset variable will write NULL into the database column
  # - unset variables use the default values
  #

  #
  # SourceID
  # Internal source idenficator (4 characters)
  #
  # default: ----
  #
  SourceID = CIB

  ... more file contents ...

  pawactl (/source): sum bcity 
  SourceID     = CIB
  Distance     = 2434
  Destination  = moon
  pawactl (/source): vgrep destina
       acity: Destination = mars
       bcity: Destination = moon
    factory1: Destination = moon
    factory2: Destination = venus
     fromfar: Destination = mars
     generic: Destination = *unset*
       kcity: Destination = moon
  pawactl (/source): cd dest 
  pawactl (/dest): ls
  (dest)          (warehouse)     moon            venus           
  (source)        mars            neptun          
  pawactl (/dest): rm venus
  rm: cannot remove: file 'venus' referenced by:
    source/factory2
    warehouse/sx0001
  pawactl (/dest): vi venus

     ... vi session ...
     ... save & quit ...


  ERROR: line 23: invalid value: valid range: (1..100)

<---------- pawactl sample session end <---------

REQUIREMENTS:
-------------

  - build, test and install Perl 5         (at least 5.003)
  - build, test and install the DBI module (at least 1.00)
  - build, test and install Gnu::ReadLine  (recommended)
  - to use datatypes 'cidr' and 'inet': a PostgreSql database
  - a database server running
  - a perl DBD module installed to connect to the database server


PLATFORMS:
----------

  This release of DBIx::FileSystem has been developed using FreeBSD.


INSTALLATION:
-------------

1.   perl Makefile.PL
2.   make
3.   make test
4.   make install

( 1. to 3. as normal user, not as root ! )


TESTING:
--------

- the shell: t/00_shell.t:

  The test currently is only a dummy because I don't know how to test
  an interactive shell across many different platforms and terminals.
  Workaround: Do a test of all required modules. Run the sample pawactl.


- access class: t/02_access_data.t

  This test requires a running database server containing the sample database 
  coming with the sample program pawactl. To prepare the tests for the
  access class do:

  1. create the database on the server using SQL or commandline:
  	CREATEDB warehouse
  2. modify example 'pawactl' to connect to this database. Edit the lines
     where these variables are set:
        $DBCONN
	$DBUSER
	$DBPWD
  3. run example 'perl -Iblib/lib examples/pawactl recreatedb' to install 
     the sample data in db
  4. modify the test t/02_access_data.t to connect to the sample database.
     Edit the lines where the following variables are set, so that they have
     the same values as in pawactl:
        $DBCONN
	$DBUSER
	$DBPWD
  5. do not change the sample database by playing around with pawactl!
  6. now you can test:
  	either: 'make test'
	or manually: 'perl -Iblib/lib t/02_access_data.t'


  
USING EXAMPLES:
---------------

To play around with the example warehouse you need a sample database:

  1. create the database on the server using SQL or commandline:
  	createdb warehouse
  2. modify example 'pawactl' to connect to this database. Edit the lines
     where these variables are set:
        $DBCONN
	$DBUSER
	$DBPWD
  3. run example 'perl -Iblib/lib examples/pawactl recreatedb' to install 
     the sample data in db
  4. play around with the example shell: 'perl -Iblib/lib examples/pawactl'
     NOTE: take a look at the comments in pawactl
  5. play around with the access sample: 'perl -Iblib/lib examples/access'
