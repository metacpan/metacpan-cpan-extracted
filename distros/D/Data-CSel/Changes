0.02     2016-03-22  Released-By: PERLANCAR

         - This release improves "compatibility" with CSS selector.

         - [Incompatible change] Type selector no longer uses isa() but string
           comparison of class name. This means the expression 'T' only matches
           objects of class T and not subclasses of T. To match subclasses, use
           the newly implemented class selector.

         - Implement class (.CLASS) and ID selector (#ID).

         - Type or universal selector is optional if there is at least one
           attribute/class/ID selector or pseudo-classes, like in CSS selector
           syntax.

         - Allow <> inequality operator in addition to !=.

         - Add pseudo-classes: :root & :empty.

         - [Internal] Reuse methods from Class::Includable::Tree::NodeMethods to
           avoid code duplication.


0.01     2016-03-20  Released-By: PERLANCAR
