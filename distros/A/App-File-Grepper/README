App-File-Grepper

Module: App::File::Grepper.
Script: afg.

A simple but powerful tool to examine hierarchies of text files for
the occurrence of a pattern. Kind of recursive 'grep'.

A feature not present in similar tools is the ability to pass each
file that matches to vi or emacs for editing.

A simple driver script 'afg' is included for convenience.
