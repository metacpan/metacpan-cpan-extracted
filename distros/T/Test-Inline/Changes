	- No longer include Test::ClassAPI
	- Skip the false-negative failing readonly tests when testing as root
	- Changed some non-working code in a heredoc that should never be
	  run that was none-the-less breaking the RedHat package generator

2.205 Thu 12 Jul 2007
	- ACTUALLY adding a missing dependency on Test::Script

2.204 Thu 12 Jul 2007
	- Adding a missing dependency on Test::Script
	- Correcting the script/inline2test version

2.203 Wed 11 Jul 2007
	- When overwriting readonly files, delete them properly first.
	  Don't naively assume we can write to them (obviously, duh) :(
	- It turns out that File::chmod is smart enough to correctly
	  make files readonly even on Win32. Removed all the code that
	  skipped on Win32. All platforms now equal again! Yay!

2.202 Tue 10 Jul 2007
	- Adding support for writing test scripts with read-only permissions
	- Upgraded to Module::Install 0.65
	- Moving bin/inline2test to the more correct script/inline2test
	  (this has no effect on where it will actually be installed)
	- Fixing another couple of kwalitee nigglies
	  (automatically via release tool improvements since last release)

2.201 Tue 16 Jan 2007
	- [% plan %] in test2inline templates is no longer compulsory

	- Moved t/t.data to t/data
	- Upgraded to Module::Install 0.62

2.103 Wed Sep 28 2005
	- Removed Test::Inline::IO::File::VCS. It is incompleted, and never
	  should have been distributed in the dist.

2.102 Thu Sep 22 2005
	- To handle people with problems installing RT and a few other
	  programs, add a dependency on Pod::Tests

2.101 Tue Sep 13 2005
	- Rebuilding to synchronize with new Module::Install and
	  ExtUtils::AutoInstall
	- Tweaks the per-section test code to make more applicable value
	  appear in the failure summary.
	- Removed all remaining use of UNIVERSAL::isa, switching to a
	  more accurate Params::Util approach. Should allow for improved
	  extensibility.
