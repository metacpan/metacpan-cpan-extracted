# We _Don't_ use Getopt::Long, because we're not sure how to 
# shoehorn our argument processing logic into it. 
#
# Specifically, we need to handle negative and positive numbers 
# (let's call them A and B) and various A..B-type ranges as options.
# (e.g.: A, ..B, A.., and A..B).
#
# Note that allowing un-hyphened options which are not filenames is convenient...
#  but probably breaks POSIX recommendations.
#
# Our closest 'role model' (other than the anachronistic awk) 
#  is cut, which uses -f 'fields' to specify fields :/, no ranges, no exclusion option, etc.
# Also, cut uses 'tab' as its default delimiter: jawk uses whitespace [specifically split(' ', $line),
#  which acts more like awk] as its default delimiter.

=head1 NAME

jawk -- like awk, but post-modern and perly. AKA, Josh's Awk.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

jawk [-x] [-e 'code'] [-d delim] fieldspec [fieldspec...] [-- (FILES..)]:

If you haven't seen awk, then jawk can be described as a flexible tool for extracting columns 
of data from text files.

If you've seen 'awk', then we can describe jawk as a replacement for statements like

  awk '{print $N}' 

which supports ranges, indexing columns by negative numbers, a perl mode, and more.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

jawk 1 is somewhat like awk '{print $1}'. Let's start with a fairly complex example.
Suppose you have a file called 'users.txt' with lines of data in this format:
   
   Bob Elmer, 2716 Fremont Blvd, New York, NY, 12344, ID:91818, CanastaRating:3.1415
   Elmer Fudd, 1 Bunny Hill Drive, Tarrytown, NY, 87654, ID:1, CanastaRating:123456789

This statement would pull out the 1st, and 3rd through last columns, using ', ' as an 
input delimiter (we've put two spaces between options, for clarity):

  jawk  -d', '  1  3..-1  --  users.txt 

Note the use of negative indexes, the non-default element delimiter via C<-d>, 
and the C<--> anti-option (which indicates that following arguments should be considered
files to read).

jawk also allows ranges using the C<..> sequence. For example, a field specification can look 
like C<A>, C<A..B>, C<A..>, or C<..B>, where (C<A> and C<B> can be negative or 
positive integers.

Negative values for A and B count backwards, so -1 is the last field.

Use -- or - FILENAME.txt to read from files. '--' is needed to treat FILENAME.txt as file 
and not fieldspec. See examples below.

Where you might previously use a command like 

  grep pattern file.txt | awk '{print $2}'

to pull out the 2nd column from a file, you can now do:

  grep pattern file.txt | jawk 2

jawk offers many other improvements.  Here are examples:

select out the 1st, 3rd, and 4th columns from file

  cat file | jawk 1 3 4

select all columns except the 1st, and 9th through remaining. Uses the -x option
for an 'except' meaning.

   cat file | jawk -x 1 9..-1
      
select out the first through third, and the second to last, and last cols from a file.

  cat file | jawk 1..3 -2 -1

Same as above, but using : as an input delimiter instead of whitespace.  Note 
use of -- to start list of files to read from @ARGV, so we can pass C<file> to 
jawk directly instead of through C<cat>.
      
  jawk -d: 1..3 -2 -1 -- file 

There is also a -exe='perlcode' mode where you access
the args via @F, and not via named positional args. Like so:

  cat file | jawk -e 'print "@F\n";'

=head1 OPTIONS

Here's an explation of all the command-line options:

=over 4

=item C<NON-ZERO INTEGER>

A field specification option indicating that this particular 
column should (or should not, depending on -x, be output).

Negative indexes count from the right, like in perl, so the right-most 
column is number C<-1>.

=item C<RANGE OF NON-ZERO INTEGERS>

Integer ranges are specified with C<..>, and given that A and B 
are non-zero integers, can look like 

 A..B
 A..
 ..B

If you specify ranges in reverse order from their source, 
like C<cat file | jawk -1..1> or C<cat file | jawk 8-2>
you'll get the fields in reverse order, like you asked.

=item -d delimiter (or -d=delimiter)

Specify an alternate delimiter in place of '\s+'. If not ' ', the
delimiter is processed through perl's quotemeta() function and used as 
a regular expression to match between input fields.

=item -j joiner (or -j=joiner)

Specify an alternate join character sequence in place of 'space'.

=item -x

Exclude the chosen columns, negating their meaning. Does not interoperate with -e 'perlcode' option.

=item -e='perlcode' or -e 'perlcode'

Use perl code passed to process parsed items. Fields come in through the @F array, and are 0-indexed
(like in perl) instead of 1-indexed (like in jawk and cut). A simple example, which shows the first and second
columns of input, is

   cat file.txt | jawk -e 'print "$F[0] $F[1]\n"'

=item -w

Run perl code used with -e option with warnings on. (Strictness is always enabled but can
be disabled by putting 'no strict' in your script).

=item -v

Show version number of jawk and exit.

=item --

Ends argument parsing. Used to pass filenames to read from stdin. See examples above.
