testontap

The command-line entrypoint to App::TestOnTap, a tool for running a suite of test
'executables' in arbitrary languages in a directory tree.

It will aggregate and summarize their TAP (I<Test Anything Protocol>) output, optionally saving the results for later processing.

For a description of valid options and arguments, see the L<App::TestOnTap::Args> documentation.

For the manual, see L<App::TestOnTap>.

Also see L<http://testanything.org> for general information about TAP, as well as the various
Test::* and TAP::* modules.
