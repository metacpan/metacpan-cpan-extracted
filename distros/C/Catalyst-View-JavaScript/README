NAME
    Catalyst::View::JavaScript - Cache and/or compress JavaScript output

VERSION
    version 0.995

SYNOPSIS
    This module fetches JavaScript either from the stash or from
    "$c->output". By default the JavaScript code is read from
    "$c->stash->{js}" and compressed. The content type is set to
    "text/javascript".

    By default this view will not compress and/or cache if your application
    is in the debug mode.

METHODS
  cache
    If $c is able to cache (i. e. "if $c->can('cache')") the value of
    "cache" is used as key to cache the JavaScript output. This method
    returns the view so you can invoke it like this:

      $c->detach( $c->view('JavaScript')->cache('unique-cache-key') );

  compress
    Set this to a true value to enable compression of the code. See
    JavaScript::Minifier::XS for more information on how this minification
    works. Defaults to 1.

  copyright
    This string will be displayed on the top of the output enclosed in a
    commentary tag.

  disable_if_debug
    If you set the debug flag on your application caching and compressing is
    disabled. Defaults to 1.

  output
    If this is set to a true value this module fetches the JavaScript code
    from "$c->output" and ignores the value of "stash". Defaults to 0.

  key
    This module looks in the stash for this value for JavaScript if "stash"
    is enabled. Defaults to "js".

  stash
    Set this to a true value if the JavaScript code is on the stash. Set the
    stash value with "key". Defaults to 1.
