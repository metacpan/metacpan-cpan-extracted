=head1 NAME

Log::Report::Dispatcher::Perl - send messages to die and warn

=head1 INHERITANCE

 Log::Report::Dispatcher::Perl
   is a Log::Report::Dispatcher

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  dispatcher Log::Report::Dispatcher::Perl => 'default',
    accept => 'NOTICE-';

  # close the default dispatcher
  dispatcher close => 'default';

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Ventilate the problem reports via the standard Perl error mechanisms:
C<die()>, C<warn()>, and C<print()>.  There can be only one such dispatcher
(per thread), because once C<die()> is called, we are not able to return.
Therefore, this dispatcher will always be called last.

In the early releases of L<Log::Report|Log::Report>, it tried to simulate the behavior
of warn and die using STDERR and exit; however: that is not possible.
