Edits to the Changelog

Mon Jan 24 07:16:23 2005
	- Revision history for HTML::ReportWriter had a version jump from 1.0 to 1.1.
	  This should have been from 1.0 to 1.0.1. This has been fixed.

Revision history for Perl extension HTML::ReportWriter.

1.5.1 Fri Jun 27 10:21:29 2008
    - Bugfix to export_to_excel function. Now, if a column is hidden, it is spliced out of the
      result set instead of being left there and throwing the column headings off.

1.5.0 Mon Oct 1 17:08:00 2007
    - Added LANGUAGE_TOKENS parameter which allows the module text to be easily customized and 
      translated. (Thanks to Peter Siewert)
    - Added column definition parameter 'hide_column'.  A field can now be pulled from the database 
      without having to print that field to the screen.
    - Refactored the draw function.  It now returns useful info, either the report text as a string
      or the result of exporting the report.  Additionally, it now accepts an optional parameter that
      suppresses the printing of the report to STDOUT. Changes are backwards compatible.
      

1.4.1 Mon Oct 09 19:16:32 2006
	- No changes, version number incremented to match the version of the package.

1.4.0 Fri Jun 09 11:37:21 2006
	- Documentation updates. (Thanks to Mark Stosberg)
	- Added get_limit and get_sort, that accept the driver name of the database connection, via
	  $dbh->{Driver}->{Name} and will return the proper SQL. Now additional support can be added
	  easily by matching the name of the DBI driver.
	- Excel export moved into a separate function, exports made more modular so that other export
	  formats can be more easily added. Also, export_to_excel can be over-ridden if desired now.
	- Makefile.PL modified - Template and Spreadsheet::SimpleExcel are no longer required. The module
	  now dies or warns if you attempt to do something without having the necessary modules installed.
	- RESULTS_PER_PAGE can now be set to 0 to disable paging if desired.
	- New attribute DEBUG in ReportWriter.pm. At this point it only triggers dumping of the generated
	  SQL query. May dump additional useful information in the future.

1.3.2 Tue Apr 26 19:22:15 2005
	- Added DOCTYPE override
	- Fixed warnings being generated by a couple of checks that would occasionally hit variables
	  that had not yet been defined.
	- Modified the export handling. I removed the EXCEL_EXPORT_VARIABLE in favor of EXPORT_VARIABLE.
	  This change will make it easier for me to add PDF exports later. This change is not backwards
	  compatible with release 1.3.0. My apologies; I was in a hurry to get the feature out and didn't
	  implement it in an extendable way. This change will not break anything unless
	  you previously set the value of 'EXCEL_EXPORT_VARIABLE' explicitly.

1.3.1 Tue Apr 26 11:02:20 2005
	- Removed debugging statement that shouldn't have been part of the release... oops.

1.3.0 Mon Apr 25 17:52:33 2005
	- Added Export to Excel feature
	- Added REPORT_TABLE_WIDTH attribute
	- Completed work that was begun on draw_func attribute of column definitions

1.1.0 Mon Mar 15 23:09:11 2005
	- documentation edits for clarity
	- Added grouping feature. Supporting changes:
		- modifications to new()
		- modification to CSS to support even/odd coloring scheme on the TD instead of TR
		- moved row_counter handling out of the template, created depth-level tracking
		  row_counter so that grouped results can be colored correctly
		- added draw_row function, took logic out of template with regards to drawing rows
		- added group_results function
	- moved results retrieval logic from draw() and created a function for it called get_results.
	  This should help when we implement additional data retrieval interfaces. Additionally, enabled
	  the development of the grouping code.
	- documentation addition discussing overriding get_results
	- documentation updates for new feature(s)
	- modifications to new() to support upcoming draw_func option (not yet implemented)
	- renamed variables to lowercase versions of themselves in the template to avoid possible
	  future collisions with reserved words.
	- updated TODO

1.0.2 Mon Jan 24 07:19:11 2005
	- Fixed bug in column counting. Only caused problems if simplified columns were in use, AFAICT
	- Fixed a ref() check that wasn't accounting for ''. This broke simplified columns completely
	- Fixed broken example code (EXAMPLES section of docs)
	- Removed reference to CGI::Auth::Simple until such time as I can release it
	- Added mysql statements to create demo data for testing the ReportWriter module(s)

1.0.1 Tue Jan 11 17:12:00 2005
	- incremented version number, doc updates. Only real code change was made to PagingAndSorting

1.0 Wed Dec 29 22:30:15 2004
	- Fixed handling of MySQL v4 results -- if you page past the end of the result set, it moves
	  you to the last page of the result set
	- Added support for MySQL 3 using count(*)
	- Broke the CSS into a CSS argument so that it can be overridden
	- Documented the ReportWriter module. Documentation may contain errors.
	  since I don't know how soon I'll be able to proof-read the docs, I'm
      going to upload as-is.

0.9.1 Wed Dec 29 16:47:00 2004
	- Added handling for blank result sets to the default template
	- default blank arrayref for results in draw() to avoid warnings
	- warn on template processing error in draw()
	- updated TODO section

0.9  Thu Dec 23 00:12:00 2004
	- original version

Revision history for Perl extension HTML::ReportWriter::PagingAndSorting.

1.5.0 Mon Oct 1 17:08:00 2007
    - Added support to get_paging_table to support language tokenization of the results/paging
      counter. (Thanks to Peter Siewert)
    - Sync'd the version number with the main module.

1.3.0 Mon Oct 09 19:16:32 2006
	- Patch to add support for SQLite. (Thanks to Steven Mackenzie)

1.2.0 Fri Jun 09 11:37:21 2006
	- Documentation updates. (Thanks to Mark Stosberg)
	- Added support for PostgreSQL. (Thanks to Mark Stosberg)
	- Added path_info support to URL generation. (Thanks to Mark Stosberg)
	- Added get_limit and get_sort, that accept the driver name of the database connection, via
	  $dbh->{Driver}->{Name} and will return the proper SQL. Now additional support can be added
	  easily by matching the name of the DBI driver.
	- Makefile.PL modified - Template and Spreadsheet::SimpleExcel are no longer required. The module
	  now dies or warns if you attempt to do something without having the necessary modules installed.
	- RESULTS_PER_PAGE can now be set to 0 to disable paging if desired.

1.1.3 Fri Mar 18 19:46:00 2005
	- Fixed a bug that was causing the paging array to not draw an opening table tag.
	  This caused problems when using a header/footer that was table based.

1.1.2 Tue Jan 11 16:13:00 2005
	- Added 'order' attribute to columns definition to deal with ordering problems on
	  a formatted column

1.1.1 Wed Dec 29 16:47:00 2004
	- removed die() from get_paging_table is NUM_RESULTS is 0. Instead return blank string
	- add !defined checks to avoid warnings if DEFAULT_SORT isn't set and no sort has yet been selected

1.1  Thu Dec 23 00:12:00 2004
	*** This release is not backwards compatible with previous versions ***
	- Packaged the paging module under the ReportWriter module, now that RW is ready for release.
	- Fixed one bad reference to SORT_DEFAULT, should have been DEFAULT_SORT (in constructor).
	- Removed duplicate line from constructor; setup for PAGES_IN_LIST occurred twice.
	- I made sortable_columns uppercase to match the rest of the arguments.
	- Removed get_paging_stylesheet, and imbedded the default stylesheet into the default template.
	- Fixed reference to HILIGHT_COLOR, should have been HIGHLIGHT_COLOR in constructor & docs.
	- I removed HIGHLIGHT_COLOR and FONT_COLOR since the stylesheet is now handled by RW, thus
	  invalidating the previous change. It's left here for historical bug-tracking reasons.
	- Replaced (DESC|ASC)_IMAGE with (DESC|ASC)_HTML (which could be an image). This enabled me to 
	  set a reasonable default, the HTML entities &uarr; and &darr;
	- Changed the behaviour of the num_results function. Now may return FALSE in certain circumstances.
	  Check docs for details.

1.0.1  Thu Dec 16 12:41:00 2004
	- Fixed name of sub to match documentation
	- Changed sub name to be consistent with other subroutines
	- Updated SYNOPSIS to include a more full-fledged example

1.0  Tue Dec 14 17:28:34 2004
	- original version
