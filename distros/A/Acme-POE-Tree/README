       Acme::POE::Tree uses IO::Tty to learn the current terminal size, Curses
       to fill the terminal with a colorful Christmas tree, and POE to animate
       the lights.

       Create a new Acme::POE::Tree application.  The light and star animation
       delays may be set here.  The tree may also be set to exit automatically
       after a short amount of time:

               use Acme::POE::Tree;
               my $tree = Acme::POE::Tree->new(
                       {
                               star_delay => 1.5,  # shimmer star every 1.5 sec
                               light_delay => 2,   # twinkle lights every 2 sec
                               run_for => 10,      # automatically exit after 10 sec
                       }
               );
               $tree->run();

       rruunn

       Run the tree until the user decides they've had enough.
