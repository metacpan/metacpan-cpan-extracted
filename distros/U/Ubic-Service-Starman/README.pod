=head1 DESCRIPTION

This service is a common ubic wrap for psgi applications.
It uses starman for running these applications.

It is a very simple wrapper around L<Ubic::Service::Plack> that
uses L<starman> as the binary instead of L<plackup>.  It
defaults the C<server> argument to 'Starman' so you don't have to pass
it in, and adds the ability to reload (which will gracefully restart
your L<Starman> workers without any connections lost) using
C<ubic reload service_name>.

=head1 METHODS

=item reload

Reload adds the ability to send a C<HUP> signal to the L<Starman> server
to gracefully reload your app and all the workers without losing any
connections.
