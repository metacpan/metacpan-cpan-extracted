Changes for Perl extension Perl-Metrics2

0.06 Fri  7 Aug 2009
	- Added missing File::Find::Rule::Perl dependency

0.05 Tue  4 Aug 2009
	- A variety of more efficient indexes and index generators.
	- Make the main document loop find documents in real-time rather
	  than pre-build a list of them. Saves even more memory.
	- Strip most of the speed monitoring code, it needed the pre-baked
	  file list to work.
	- Move the study index from the plugins to the core
	- Pass-through md5 through several methods to prevent one instance
	  of it having to be regenerated.

0.04 Mon  3 Aug 2009
	- Implenting indexable tracking
	- Prevent duplicate work in core plugin
	- Plugins not advertise destruction
	- Allow the last destructive plugin to destroy the original
	  document, to prevent excessive cloning.
	- Improved runtime estimation based on file-size throughput of
	  the cache .ppi storables. Per-file estimation was pointless
	  when running files smallest to largest.
