NAME
    Apache::Perldoc - mod_perl handler to spooge out HTML perldocs

DESCRIPTION
    A simple mod_perl handler to give you Perl documentation on installed
    modules.

    The following configuration should go in your httpd.conf

        <Location /perldoc>
          SetHandler perl-script
          PerlHandler Apache::Perldoc
        </Location>

    You can then get documentation for a module "Foo::Bar" at the URL
    "http://your.server.com/perldoc/Foo::Bar"

    Note that you can also get the standard Perl documentation with URLs
    like "http://your.server.com/perldoc/perlfunc" or just
    "http://your.server.com/perldoc" for the main Perl docs.

    Finally, you can search for a particular Perl keyword with
    "http://your.server.com/perldoc/f::keyword" The 'f' is used by analogy
    with the "-f" flag to "perldoc".

    In addition to Perl modules, you can have "Apache::Perldoc" convert
    ".pod" files to HTML with the following configiration:

        <FilesMatch \.pod$>
          SetHandler perl-script
          PerlHandler Apache::Perldoc
        </FilesMatch>

    This has not been extensively tested, but appears to mostly work.

Running under "PerlTaintCheck"
    If you have "PerlTaintCheck" turned on, then we can't rely on
    "$ENV{PATH}" to find perldoc and pod2html. You'll have to specify the
    full paths to perldoc and pod2html like so:

        <Location /perldoc>
          SetHandler        perl-script
          PerlHandler Apache::Perldoc
          PerlSetVar        PERLDOC  /usr/local/bin/perldoc
          PerlSetVar        POD2HTML /usr/local/bin/pod2html
        </Location>

Specifying your own "TMP" directory
    "Apache::Perldoc" assumes that it can use /tmp as the temp directory to
    run from, since pod2html requires a place to put its work files. You can
    override this with a

        PerlSetVar TMP /my/temp/directory

    Patches from Andy Lester to make it a little bit more secure.

Caveat
    Note that this is EXCEEDINGLY insecure. Run this at your own risk, and
    only on internal web sites, if you know what's good for you.

    If someone would like to make this a little more secure, I would be
    delighted to apply any patches you would like to provide. This module
    was written for my own benefit, and put back on CPAN because some folks
    asked me to.

    You have been warned.

Other neat trick - Bookmarklet
    If you create a browser bookmark to the following URL, you can highlight
    the name of a module on web page, then select the bookmark, and go
    directly to the documentation for that module. Selecting the bookmark
    without having anything highlighted will result in a pop-up dialog in
    which you can type a module name.

     javascript:Qr=document.getSelection();if(!Qr){void(Qr=prompt('Module
     name',''))};if(Qr)location.href='http://localhost/perldoc/'+escape(Qr)

    Note that that's all one line, split here for display purposes. I know
    this works in Netscape and Mozilla. Can't vouch for IE.

LICENSE
    This code is released under the HJTI license ("Here, Just Take It"), or,
    if you really want a real license, take your pick of the GPL and the
    Artistic License. Which is to say, this is release under the same terms
    as Perl itself.

    The author makes no particular claims to ownership, as this is a really
    obvious idea, and a lot of other people have been doing this for ages. I
    just appear to be the first to put it on CPAN.
