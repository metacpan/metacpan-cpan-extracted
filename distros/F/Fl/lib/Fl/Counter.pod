=head1 NAME

Fl::Counter - Controls a Single Floating Point Value with Button or Keyboard Arrows

=head1 Description

The Fl::Counter controls a single floating point value with button (or
keyboard) arrows. Double arrows buttons achieve larger steps than simple
arrows.

The type of an Fl::Counter object can be set using C<type(...)> to:

=over

=item FL_NORMAL_COUNTER: Displays a counter with 4 arrow buttons.

=item FL_SIMPLE_COUNTER: Displays a counter with only 2 arrow buttons.

=back

=head1 Methods

Fl::Counter inherits from Fl::Valuator and Fl::Widget. On top of that, it
exposes the following methods...

=head2 new(...)

    my $count_a = Fl::Counter->new(0, 0, 250, 500, 'Important Stuff');
    my $count_b = Fl::Counter->new(0, 0, 250, 500);

The constructor creates a new widget using the given position, size, and
label.

The default type is FL_NORMAL_COUNTER.

The destructor removes the widget.

             optional => [['const char *', 'label', ' 0']],
             returns  => 'Fl_Counter *'
            }

    ]
};

=head2 C<lstep(...)>

    $count_a->lstep(1.2);

Sets the increment for the large step buttons.

The default value is C<1.0>.

    definitions => [
        {required => [[qw[double a]]],
         returns => 'void'
        }
    ]
};

=pod

=head2 C<step(...)>

    $count_a->step(.25, 1);

Sets the increments for both the normal and large step buttons.

    $count_a->step(.25);

Sets the increment for the normal step buttons.
