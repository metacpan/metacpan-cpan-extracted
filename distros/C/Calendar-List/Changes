0.21    2008-06-02
        - updated META.yml to correctly include DateTime optional prerequisite.
        - added dubious TestData to META.yml to see how PAUSE and CPANTS 
          respond. This is dubious because TestData.pm is provided in the 
          distribution under the ./t directory, and listed as no_index, which
          CPANTS ignores and says there is a prerequisite missing!

0.20    2008-03-28
