Revision history for Perl extension Chess::PGN::EPD.

0.01  Fri Feb 08 11:52:56 2002
        - original version; created by h2xs 1.21 with options
                -A -X Chess::PGN::EPD
0.02  Fri Feb 08 17:06:00 2002
        - documentation patch, correct pod format in SYNOPSIS section
0.03  Fri Feb 08 23:32:17 2002
        - added epdset; allows user to specify the initial position for a game
        - patched bug associated with $debug parameter of epdlist (didn't work
          since @moves eats all of @_, $debug was always undef)
0.04  Sat Feb 09 00:49:55 2002
        - documentation patch, correct reference to Chess::PGN::Parse (was
          Chess::PGN::PGNParser)
      Fri Feb 15 06:00:08 2002
        - added epdstr; converts an epd string into a variety of typeset positions
        - greatly expanded documentation
0.05  Fri Feb 15 15:27:33 2002
        - fixed bug, needed to parse moves of form 6e5 because author of ChessPad thought there
          was a need to dis-ambiguate the move
      Sun Feb 17 13:47:56 2002
        - documentation patch, remove dummy comment from README
0.06  Wed Feb 20 14:23:00 2002
        - jump from 0.04 to 0.06 because I forgot to change the $VERSION in the last upload
        - made necessary changes to Makefile.pl in order to install Berkeley DB files used
          by epdcode()
        - added epdcode; converts epd array to one of ECO code, NIC code or Opening name
      Thu Feb 21 07:24:28 2002
        - documentation patch, CHESS::PGN -> Chess::PGN, PGN::PGNParser -> PGN::Parse
        - patched Makefile.pl, install:: -> install ::, spaces are important!
        - added code to find DB files at BEGIN{}
0.07  Sun Mar 10 08:37:35 2002
        - yet more documentation fixes - remove misleading script names from examples
        - added DB_File to dependancy list in changes
        - removed 'taxonomy' from TODO list
        - add 'palview' to epdstr type
        - add 'text' to epdstr type
0.08  Wed Mar 20 19:55:48 2002
        - add %font2map lookup table
0.09  Sat Mar 30 18:58:00 2002
        - correct make test bug, $db_path needs default value of './db/' since test happens
          before install
0.10  Mon Apr 01 15:03:27 2002
        - correct Makefile.PL to use '/' in list of files, not '\' which fails under Linux
0.11  Tue Apr 02 09:08:21 2002
        - must correct target of modified file list as well, 
          not 'Chess/PGN/db' but 'Chess\PGN\db'
0.12  Tue Apr 02 13:54:01 2002
        - patch for permissions bug, db files are created 0644, so should access in
          read-only mode
        - also remove INIT block as un-necessary
0.13  Mon Jun 24 04:23:01 2002
        - fold in patch for 'Malformed UTF-8 character (byte 0xfe) in ord...' problem found
          by Cyril Malkov - patch is his too!
        - add better test.pl file
0.14  Mon Jun 24 17:00:36 2002
        - re-synchronize Makefile.PL to use the one with all of the corrections in it
0.15  Wed Jun 26 20:25:38 2002
        - figured out that MANIFEST should reflect what you want in the distribution,
          but it should do so in a unix like fashion - similar to problem found in
          version .10
        - corrected other typo in README (version should be current, not 0.12!)
0.16  Thu Jun 27 04:23:10 2002
        - put Makefile.PL back in the MANIFEST and therefore back in the distribution!

0.24  Sun Apr 05 14:40:00 2009
