0.026     2016-04-22 09:54:05Z (TRIAL RELEASE)
          - bump version of [MakeMaker::Awesome] needed for optional tests, to

          - bumped up "background perl" used in ExtUtils::HasCompiler

0.024     2016-04-21 11:07:53Z (TRIAL RELEASE)
          - can_xs() is now implemented with ExtUtils::HasCompiler, rather

0.020     2016-03-16 02:42:30Z (TRIAL RELEASE)

            FileMunger, rather than InstallTool)

0.019     2016-01-20 04:43:24Z
          - perl prerequisite lowered to 5.8 (Graham Ollis)

            '-raw_from_file'
          - *_requires subs now warn if adding a prereq that might conflict
            with one that already exists (prereq merging not yet supported)

          - fix new test failure on MSWin32

0.016     2015-09-07 00:12:19Z
          - added new helper subs: requires, runtime_requires,
            build_requires, and test_requires, as sugar for updating prereqs
            in Makefile.PL
          - the -include_sub option is no longer needed: -raw clauses are also
            now searched for sub names.

0.015     2015-08-21 23:49:23Z
          - has_module($module) now returns the $VERSION of the installed

0.014     2015-07-22 02:41:49Z
          - new '-condition' option, as sugar to provide expressions to be
            inserted into Makefile.PL (definitions of referenced subroutines
            are automatically included)

0.013     2015-05-30 19:16:03Z
          - require a new enough Module::CoreList in tests to ensure is_core()

0.011     2015-05-23 18:27:08Z
          - warn whenever can_xs, can_cc, or can_run is used, until
            implementation concerns are resolved
          - add new sub has_module, as an alternative to can_use that does
            not load the module

0.010     2015-02-15 01:12:41Z (TRIAL RELEASE)
          - new -raw_from_file option, when content is too long to inline into
            dist.ini
          - new -include_sub option, to include definitions of commonly-used
            helper subroutines

0.009     2014-11-29 06:28:55Z
          - bump minimum required version of ExtUtils::MakeMaker, to avoid a

          - fix uninitialized warning on 5.10.x and earlier

0.007     2014-09-18 05:26:51Z

            '-raw' strings

0.006     2014-09-06 08:44:46Z
          - no longer dropping the last character off Makefile.PL (significant
            when several copies of this plugin run at once!)

0.005     2014-06-16 00:18:15Z
          - fix case where Makefile.PL content was not recognized when there
            were no (static) prerequisites declared for the distribution

0.004     2014-05-19 05:15:36Z
          - fix tests that fail with older ExtUtils::MakeMaker due two stupid
            typos that conspired together in a web of evil

0.003     2014-05-17 17:11:46Z
          - really fix tests this time...
          - new runtime check for versions of [MakeMaker::Awesome] that are
            too old to be compatible with the munging done in this plugin

0.002     2014-05-13 05:03:02Z
          - fix tests that fail when ExtUtils::MakeMaker is at version 6.63_02
            or older
