MARC (manipulate MAchine Readable Cataloging)
VERSION=1.07, 23 April 2000

This is a cross-platform module. All of the files except README.txt
are LF-only terminations. You will need a better editor than Notepad
to read them on Win32. README.txt is README with CRLF.

DESCRIPTION:

MARC.pm is a Perl 5 module for reading in, manipulating, and outputting
bibliographic records in the USMARC format. You will need to have Perl
5.004 or greater for MARC.pm to work properly. Since it is a Perl module
you use MARC.pm from one of your own Perl scripts. It handles conversions
from MARC into ASCII (text),  Library of Congress MARCMaker, HTML,
and ISBD. Input from MARCMaker format is also supported. Individual
records, fields, indicators, and subfields can be created, modified, and
deleted. It can extract URLs from the 856 field into HTML.

The MARC::XML module adds conversions to and from XML.

The MARC::Tie module adds another way to access this data.

MARC.pm can handle both single and batches of MARC records. The limit on
the number of records in a batch is determined by the memory capacity of
the machine you are running. If memory is an issue for you MARC.pm will
allow you to read in records from a batch gradually. MARC.pm also includes
a variety of tools for searching, removing, and even creating records from
scratch.

INSTALL and TEST:

On linux and Unix, this distribution uses Makefile.PL and the "standard"
install sequence for CPAN modules:
	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install

On Win32, Makefile.PL creates equivalent scripts for the "make-deprived"
and follows a similar sequence.
	perl Makefile.PL
	perl test.pl
	perl install.pl

Both sequences create install files and directories. The test uses a
small sample input file and creates outputs in various formats. You can
specify an optional PAUSE (0..5 seconds) between pages of output. The
'perl t/test1.pl PAUSE' form works on all OS types. The test will
indicate if any unexpected errors occur (not ok).

Once you have installed, you can check if Perl can find it. Change to
some other directory and execute from the command line:

            perl -e "use MARC"

No response that means everything is OK! If you get an error like
* Can't locate method "use" via package MARC *, then Perl is not
able to find MARC.pm--double check that the file copied it into the
right place during the install.

EXPERIMENTAL ELEMENTS:

A number of functions were added in Version 0.92 by Derek Lane to
support updating "000" and "008" fields. All of these are experimental
and may be subject to changes or syntax refinements. Here are his
comments:

	(unpack_ldr): gets an updateable version of the LDR
	
	(_unpack_ldr): This and other _ - series functions work fine on a
	record-by-record basis. In general all official methods in the
	(un)?pack.* series call corresponding _(un)?pack.* methods. The
	official interfaces have to specify the records.
	
	(_pack_ldr): Added in 0.95d
	
	(bib_format): returns, e.g. BOOK or SERIAL. Don't confuse this
	with usmarc vs XML.
	
	(_bib_format): Suitable for record-by-record access.

	(unpack_008): Returns updateable fixed field information.

	(_unpack_008): Internal record-by-record equivalent.

	(_pack_008): Added in 0.95d

COMPATIBILITY:

The length() method has been removed because it overrides a Perl builtin.
Use the new marc_count() method instead.

Version 0.93 adds character_set conversions to MarcMaker format reads and
writes. The usmarc/ustext character maps are used by default, so existing
files in that format will produce different results than earlier versions.

Starting with version 1.00, the XML conversions are moved to MARC::XML.

Version 1.05 no longer assumes fields with same tag are contiguous. This
is required for CJK characters and may introduce other changes from earlier
conversions. The addition of proper date stamp generation in the "005" field
may now create different output from the same source data.

NOTES:

Please let us know if you run into any difficulties using MARC.pm--
e'd be happy to try to help. Also, please contact us if you notice any
bugs, or if you would like to suggest an improvement/enhancement. Email
addresses are listed at the bottom of this page.

The module is provided in standard CPAN distribution format. Additional
documentation is created during the installation (html and man formats).
