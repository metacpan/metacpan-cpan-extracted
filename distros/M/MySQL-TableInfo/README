.::MySQL/TableInfo version 1.01::..
============================

.:DESCRIPTION:.

MySQL::TableInfo is a handy class for getting easy access to MySQL tables' descriptions
which is available via

    DESCRIBE table_name, SHOW COLUMNS FROM table_name

queries. It's also handy for constructing form based CGI applications to control HTML forms'
attributes such as C<VALUE>, C<SIZE>, C<MAXLENGTH>, C<TYPE> and so forth. 
For example, if you have a ENUM('Yes', 'No') column in your mysql table, then you normally
would present it either as a group of radio buttons, or as a <SELECT> menu. If you modify
the column, and add one more option, ENUM('Yes', 'No', 'N/A'), then you will have to 
re-write your html code accordingly. By using MySQL::TableInfo, you can avoide this double 
troubles. Consider the following code:

        use CGI;
        use DBI;
        my MySQL::TableInfo;

        my $CGI = new CGI:
        my $dbh = DBI->connect(....);
        my $table = new MySQL::TableInfo($dbh, "bio");

        print $CGI->header, $CGI->start_html("MySQL::TableInfo");

        print $CGI->start_form,
                $CGI->div("Do you wear beard?"),
                $CGI->popup_menu(-name=>'has_beard', 
                                                 -values=>[$table->set('beard')],
                                                 -default=>$table->default('beard')),
        $CGI->end_form;

        print $CGI->end_html;

As you see, modifying 'beard' column, which is an enumeration column, whould
reflect in your CGI too.
