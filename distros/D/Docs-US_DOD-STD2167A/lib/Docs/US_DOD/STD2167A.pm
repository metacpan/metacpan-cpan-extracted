=head1 Foreword

=over

=item 1

This standard establishes uniform requirements for the software
development that are applicable throughout the system life cycle. The
requirements of this standard provide the basis for Government insight into a
contractor's software development, testing, and evaluation efforts.

=item 2

This standard is not intended to specify or discourage the use of any
particular software development method. The contractor is responsible for
selecting software development methods (for example, rapid prototyping) that
best support the achievement of contract requirements.

=item 3

This standard, together with the other DOD and military document
referenced in Section 2, provides the means for
establishing, evaluating, and maintaining quality in software and associated
documentation.

=item 4

Data Item Descriptions (DIDs) applicable to this standard are listed in
Section 6. These DIDs describe a set of documents for
recording the information required by this standard. Production of deliverable
data using automated techniques is encouraged.

=item 5

Per DODD 5000.43, Acquisition Streamlining, this standard
must be appropriately tailored by the program manager to ensure that only
cost-effective requirements are cited in defense solicitations and contracts.
Tailoring guidance can be found in DOD-HDBK-248, Guide for Application
and Tailoring of Requirements for Defense Material Acquisitions.

=head1 1 Scope

=head2 1.1 Purpose.

The purpose of this standard is to establish requirements to be applied during
the acquisition, development, or support of software systems.

=head2 1.2 Application.

The requirements of this standard apply to the development of Computer
Software Configuration Items (CSCIs). This standard applies to the extent
specified in the contract clauses, the Statement of Work (SOW), and the
Contract Data Requirements List (CDRL).

=head2 1.2.1 System Development.

This standard should be used in conjunction with MIL-STD-499,
Engineering Management, for total system development.

=head2 1.2.2 Firmware.

This standard applies to development or support of the software element of
firmware. This standard does not apply to the development of the hardware
elements of firmware.

=head2 1.2.3 Software developed by Government agencies.

The provisions of this standard may be applied to Government agencies. When a
Government agency performs software development or support in accordance with
this standard, the term "contractor" refers to that Government agency and the
term "subcontractor" refers to any contractor of that Government agency.

=head2 1.2.4 Other applications.

While the requirements of this standard apply to Computer Software
Configuration Items (CSCIs), these requirements may be selectively applied to
the development of software not identified as a CSCI (such as, software
portions of hardware configuration items and firmware, and non-deliverable
software). In such cases, the term CSCI may be interpreted to refer to the
selected software.

=head2 1.3 Tailoring of this standard.

This standard contains a set of requirements designed to be tailored for each
contract by the contracting agency. The tailoring process intended for this
standard is the deletion of non-applicable requirements.

Appendix B. Requirements for Software Coding Standards

=head2 20.1 Purpose.

The purpose of this appendix is to specify language independent requirements
for software coding standards. The requirements specified in this appendix are
a mandatory part of this standard.

=head2 20.2 Applicability.

This appendix applies to all deliverable source code developed under the
contract.

=head2 20.3 Rules and Conventions.

The following subparagraphs define the requirements for rules and conventions
applicable to software coding standards. The contractor shall implement
software coding standards that comply with these requirements.

=head2 20.3.1 Presentation Style.

The coding standards shall describe the rules and conventions for the format
of the source code which may include paper listings, listings stored on
electronic media, or both. The rules and conventions for presentation style
shall include standards for:

=over 4 Indentation and spacing

=item *

The use of capitalization

=item *

Uniform presentation of information throughout the source code (e.g.,

=item *

the grouping together of all the data declarations)

=item *

Use of headers

=item *

Layout of source code listings

=item *

Conditions under which comments are provided and the format to be used

=item *

Size of code aggregates (e.g. on the average 100 or at most 200

=item *

executable non-expandable statements).

=back

=head2 20.3.2 Naming.

The coding standards shall describe the rules and conventions governing the
selection of identifiers used in the source code listings (e.g., identifiers
for CSUs, variables, parameters, packages, procedures, subunits, and other
aggregates of code.) Restrictions on the use of reserve words and keywords
shall be identified.

=head2 20.3.3 Restrictions on the implementation language.

The coding standards shall include a description of any restrictions imposed
on the use of constructs and features of the implementation language due to
project or machine-dependent characteristics. Machine-dependent
characteristics may include input/output features, word length-dependent
features, use of floating point arithmetic, etc. Project characteristics may
include, but are not limited to, safety or security considerations in the
operational environment.

=head2 20.3.4 Use of language constructs and features.

The coding standards shall address the allowed use of constructs and features
of the implementation language. For example, when Ada is the implementation
language, the coding standards shall address such aspects as the use of
exception handling, goto and abort statements, and unchecked conversion.

=head2 20.3.5 Complexity.

The coding standards shall describe controls and restrictions on the
complexity of code aggregates.

Appendix C. Category and Priority Classifications for Problem Reporting

=head2 30.1 Purpose.

This appendix contains requirements for a category and priority classification
scheme to be applied to all problems detected in the deliverable software or
its documentation that has been placed under contractor configuration control.

=item *

Documentation problem. The software does not operate according to supporting documentation but the software operation is correct.

=item *

Design problem. The software operated according to supporting documentation but a design deficiency exists. The design deficiency may not always result in a directly observable operational symptom but possesses the potential for causing further problems.

=back

=head2 30.3 Classification by priority.

Problems detected in the software or its documentation shall be classified by
priority as follows:

=over 4


=item *

Appendix D. Evaluation Criteria

=head2 40.1 Purpose.

This appendix contains a default set of definitions for the evaluation
criteria appearing in Figures 4 through 10. These definitions shall be
implemented by the contractor if an alternative set has not been proposed in
the Software Development Plan and accepted by the contracting agency. The
definitions specified in this appendix are a mandatory part of this
standard.

=head2 40.2 Criteria definitions.

The following definitions are listed in the order that the criteria appear in
Figures 4 through 10. For convenience, the definitions use the word "document"
for the item being evaluated, even though in some instances the item being
evaluated may be other than a document.

=head2 40.2.1 Internal consistency.

Internal consistency as used in this standard means that:

=over 4


=item *

no two statements in a document contradict one another,

=item *

a given term, acronym, or abbreviation means the same thing throughout the document, and

=item *

a given item or concept is referred to by the same name or description throughout the document.

=back

=head2 40.2.2 Understandability.

Understandability, as used in this standard means that:

=over 4


=item *

the document uses rules of capitalization, punctuation, symbols, and notation consistent with those specified in the U.S. Government Printing Office Style Manual,

=item *

all terms not contained in the U.S. Government Printing Office Style Manual or Merriam-Webster's New International dictionary (latest revision) are defined,

=item *

standard abbreviations listed in MIL-STD-12 are used,

=item *

all acronyms and abbreviations not listed in MIL-STD-12 are defined,

=item *

all acronyms and abbreviations are preceded by the word or term spelled out in full the first time they are used in the document, unless the first use occurs in a table, figure, or equation, in which case they are explained in the text or in a footnote, and

=item *

all tables, figures, and illustrations are called out in the text before they appear, in the order in which they appear in the document.

=back

=head2 40.2.3 Traceability to indicated documents.


Traceability as used in this standard means that the document in question is
in agreement with a predecessor document to which it has a hierarchical
relationship. Traceability has five elements:

=over 4


=item *

the document in question contains or implements all applicable stipulations of the predecessor document,

=item *

a given term, acronym, or abbreviation means the same thing in the documents,

=item *

a given item or concept is referred to by the same name or description in the documents,

=item *

all material in the successor document has it's basis in the predecessor document, that is, no untraceable material has been introduced, and
the two documents do not contradict one another.

=back

=head2 40.2.4 Consistency with indicated documents.

Consistency between documents, as used in this standard, means that two or
more documents that are not hierarchically related are free from
contradictions with one another. Elements of consistency are:

=over 4


=item *

no two statements contradict one another,

=item *

a given term, acronym, or abbreviation means the same thing in the documents, and

=item *

a given item or concept is referred to by the same name or description in the documents.

=back

=head2 40.2.5 Appropriate analysis, design, and coding techniques used.

The contract may include provisions regarding the requirements, analysis,
design, and coding techniques to be used. The contractor's Software
Development Plan (SDP) describes the contractor's proposed implementation of
these techniques. This criterion consists of compliance with the techniques
specified in the contract and SDP.


=head2 40.2.6 Appropriate allocation of sizing and timing resources.

This criterion, as used in this standard, means that:

=over 4


=item *

the amount of memory or time allocated to a given element does not exceed documented constraints applicable to that element, and

=item *

the sum of the allocated amounts for all subordinate elements is within the overall allocation for an item.

=back

=head2 40.2.7 Adequate test coverage or requirements
This criterion, as used in this standard, means that:

=over 4


=item *

every specified requirement is addressed by al least one test,

=item *

test cases have been selected for both "average" situation and "boundary" situations, such as minimum and maximum values,

=item *

"stress" cases have been selected, such as out-of-bound values, and

=item *

test cases that exercise combinations of different functions are included.

=back

=head2 40.3 Additional criteria.

The following definitions apply to criteria that are not self-explanatory
and that appear in the NOTES column of Figures 4 through 10. These criteria are
not included in each figure, but appear only as appropriate.

=head2 40.3.1 Adequacy of quality factors.

This criterion applies to the quality factor requirements in
the Software Requirements Specification (SRS).
Aspects to be considered are:

=over 4


=item *

trade-offs between quality factors have been considered and documented, and

=item *

each quality factor is accompanied by a feasible method to evaluate compliance, as required by the SRS DID.

=back

=head2 40.3.2 Testability of requirements.

A requirement is considered to be testable if an objective and feasible test
can be designed to determine whether the requirement is met by the
software.

=head2 40.3.3 Consistency between data definition and data use.

This criterion applies primarily to design documents. It means that each data
element is defined in a way that is consistent with its usage in the software
logic.

=head2 40.3.4 Adequacy of test cases, test procedures, (test inputs expected results, evaluation criteria).

Test cases and test procedures should specify exactly what inputs to provide,
what steps to follow, what outputs to expect, and what criteria to use in
evaluating the outputs. If any of these elements are not specified, the test
case or test procedure in inadequate.

=head2 40.3.5 Completeness of testing.

Testing is complete if all test cases and all test procedures have been
performed, all results have been recorded, and all acceptance criteria have
been met.

=head2 40.3.6 Completeness of retesting.

Retesting consists of repeating a subset of the test cases and test procedures
after software corrections have been made to correct problems found in
previous testing. Retesting is considered complete if:

=over 4


=item *

all test cases and test procedures that revealed problems in the previous testing have been repeated, their results have been recorded, and the results have met acceptance criteria, and

=item *

all test cases and test procedures that revealed no problems during the previous testing, but that test functions that are affected by the corrections, have been repeated, their results have been recorded, and the results have met acceptance criteria.
