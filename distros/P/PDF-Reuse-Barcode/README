PDF/Reuse/Barcode version 0.07
==============================

This is a sub-module to PDF::Reuse. It creates barcode "images" to be used in
PDF documents. It uses GD::Barcode and its sub-modules: GD::Barcode::Code39,
COOP2of5, EAN13 and so on to calculate the barcode pattern.
If you want Code128-barcodes you need Barcode::Code128.
Normally the barcodes are displayed on a white background and with the characters
under the bars. You can rotate the "image", make it smaller or bigger, prolong the
bars and change the background.
(But then, don't forget to test that your scanner still understands it.)
