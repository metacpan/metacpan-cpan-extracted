Revision history for JSON-Schema-Modern

0.521     2021-10-04 05:36:10Z
          - fix issues when referencing a schema in a metaschema:
            whose vocabulary is not known, but its keywords can still be
            validated, or which does not use the $vocabulary keyword at all

0.520     2021-09-27 05:56:11Z
          - support arbitrary metaschemas in the "$schema" keyword
          - support custom vocabulary classes, for use in metaschemas that use
            the "$vocabulary" keyword

0.519     2021-09-21 03:56:13Z
          - fix tests that were relying on an optional prereq

0.518     2021-09-18 22:00:42Z
          - skip some regex tests when Unicode library is too old for those
            character classes being tested
          - specification versions can now change, via the $schema keyword,
            within schema resources in a single document or via $ref to another
            resource

0.517     2021-08-28 04:34:17Z
          - restore some optional modules used for format validation to the
            prereq list that were mistakenly dropped in version 0.515
          - date-time, date and time formats no longer match non-ascii digits

0.516     2021-08-14 19:53:16Z
          - fix email format tests on older prereqs
          - avoid errors when enabling validate_formats before evaluating but
            after loading a schema

0.515     2021-08-03 04:07:02Z
          - no longer calling a keyword's callback during traverse() if that
            keyword has an error
          - better handling of blessed data types and other references
          - new config option scalarref_booleans, which will treat \0, \1 in
            data as json booleans
          - support for the most recent specification version, draft2020-12

0.514     2021-07-22 05:17:08Z
          - add_schema() now dies with the errors themselves, rather than an
            object that serializes to an unhelpful value in uncaught die()s.

0.513     2021-06-26 19:45:51Z
          - skip acceptance test for integer overflow when nvsize is too
            large to produce the expected error
          - support for specification version draft7, through the "$schema"
            keyword and the new 'specification_version' constructor option

0.512     2021-06-09 02:29:23Z
          - distribution has been renamed from JSON-Schema-Draft201909 to
            JSON-Schema-Modern. JSON::Schema::Draft201909 lives on as a
            compatibility wrapper.

0.028     2021-06-08 02:48:07Z
          - fix validation regex for the $anchor keyword
          - unevaluatedItems and unevaluatedProperties keywords are now
            applied after all other keywords in the applicator vocabulary
            (true/false results are not affected, but the order of annotations
            and errors will change)
          - calculate the canonical uri correctly after navigating a $ref:
            using the closest resource identifier to the destination, not the
            one that was used in the $ref

0.027     2021-05-15 18:13:21Z
          - fixed error strings used for failing "dependentRequired"
          - in terse output format, do not discard non-summary errors from
            schema-form of items
          - keywords in the applicator vocabulary are now applied before the
            keywords in the validation vocabulary (true/false results are not
            affected, but the order of annotations and errors will change)
          - improved validation of the "date-time", "date" and "time" formats

0.026     2021-04-08 20:13:27Z
          - fix scoping of annotations from uncle keywords (siblings of the
            schema's parent) that were improperly visible to unevaluatedItems,
            unevaluatedProperties
          - 'result' attribute in JSON::Schema::Draft201909::Result has been
            renamed to 'valid', to better match what it represents (a boolean)

0.025     2021-03-30 05:36:14Z
          - minor changes to error strings to distinguish between issues that
            can be determined from static inspection of schema(s), and those
            that only arise during runtime evaluation (such as URIs that
            map to missing schema documents, or inconsistent configuration
            values).
          - more validity checks at traversal time of $ref, $schema,
            $vocabulary values
          - update ipv4 format validation to reject leading zeroes in octets,
            helping avoid a newly-discovered vulnerability in netmasks

0.024     2021-03-23 21:53:42Z
          - the default value for "validate_formats" is once again false (it
            became true in v0.020), to properly conform to the specification

0.023     2021-02-21 18:36:32Z
          - fix "try/catch is experimental" warnings in perl 5.33.7

0.021     2021-02-06 18:50:42Z
          - [Pp]roperties$ keywords now always produce annotations when
            evaluating successfully, even if there were no matching properties
          - added the "strict_basic" output format, for strict (but incorrect)
            adherence to the draft 2019-09 specification

0.020     2021-01-02 17:12:09Z
          - the default value for "validate_formats" is now true, to reflect
            the most typical usecase.
          - gracefully handle the erroneous schema { "type": null }
          - fixes to relative-json-pointer format validation

          - now can correctly evaluate schemas containing unevaluatedItems,
            unevaluatedProperties keywords without the user having to
            explicitly set collect_annotations => 1 in the constructor

            some unevaluatedProperties errors

0.017     2020-11-24 19:15:18Z
          - refactor keyword implementations into separate vocabulary classes,
            to faciliate future support for custom vocabularies
          - traverse the schema before evaluation, for more correct
            and complete extraction of identifiers and invalid syntax
          - add callbacks to traverse(), to easily find keywords of interest

0.016     2020-11-18 18:18:40Z

          - fix dereference error when evaluating "definitions",
            "dependencies"
          - when adding two schema documents with no canonical uri, preserve
            knowledge of other identifiers found in the first document
          - add_schema() no longer adds additional URIs to the document
            object, only the evaluator

            unevaluated* when annotation collection is disabled

0.013     2020-09-15 19:14:53Z
          - detect more cases of resource identifier collisions

          - no longer allowing adding another schema document with a duplicate
            uri but different schema content (some collision checks were too
            lax).
          - fix behaviour of $recursiveRef without an $recursiveAnchor in the
            initial target scope

0.008     2020-06-22 04:24:06Z
