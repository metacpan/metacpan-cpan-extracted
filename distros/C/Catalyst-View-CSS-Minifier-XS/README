NAME
    Catalyst::View::CSS::Minifier::XS - Minify your served CSS files

VERSION
    version 2.000002

SYNOPSIS
     # creating MyApp::View::CSS
     ./script/myapp_create.pl view CSS CSS::Minifier::XS

     # in your controller file, as an action
     sub css : Local {
        my ( $self, $c ) = @_;

        # load root/css/style1.css and root/css/style2.css
        $c->stash->{css} = [qw/style1 style2/];

        $c->forward("View::CSS");
     }

     # in your html template use
     <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" media="screen" href="/css" />

DESCRIPTION
    Use your minified css files as a separated catalyst request. By default
    they are read from "$c->stash->{css}" as array or string.

CONFIG VARIABLES
    stash_variable
      sets a different stash variable from the default "$c->stash->{css}"

    css_dir
      Directory containing your css files. If a relative path is given, it
      is taken as relative to your app's root directory.

      default : css

    subinclude
      setting this to true will take your css files (stash variable) from
      your referer action

       # in your controller
       sub action : Local {
          my ( $self, $c ) = @_;

          # load exclusive.css only when /action is loaded
          $c->stash->{css} = "exclusive";
       }

      This could be very dangerous since it's using
      "$c->forward($c->request->headers->referer)". It doesn't work with the
      index action!

      default : false
