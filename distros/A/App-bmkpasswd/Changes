Revision history for Perl module App::bmkpasswd

2.012002 2016-07-26

  - Safer Bytes::Random::Secure::Tiny require()

2.012001 2016-07-25

  - Safer Crypt::Passwd::XS require() (ignore '.' in @INC)

  - bmkpasswd executable always drops '.' from @INC

  - Default salt generator now package-scoped

  - Test suite improvements

2.011006 2016-03-20

  - Improved check for POSIX::Termios in `bmkpasswd`

  - Minor `bmkpasswd` cleanups; take advantage of IO::Handle methods as long
    as we have it

2.011005 2016-03-09

  - Skip 'bmkpasswd' command tests on MSWin32

    While the utility is reported to work without issue, the test does not,
    and I lack access to an appropriate machine for deeper diving.

2.011004 2016-03-09

  - Fall back to Term::ReadKey on MSWin32

2.011003 2016-03-09

  - Fall back to Term::ReadKey to turn off terminal echo on 5.8.x, if
    available; if not, warn loudly and suggest it before prompting for a
    password to crypt

2.011002 2016-03-09

  - Fix `bmkpasswd` executable on 5.8.x (no POSIX::ECHO available)

2.011001 2016-03-08

  - Add `bmkpasswd --available` for listing available crypt methods

  - Adjust constant time comparison to avoid potentially leaking any
    information regarding the length of random-length SHA salts

  - Add proper Test::Cmd tests for `bmkpasswd`

2.010001 2015-10-23

  - Reintroduce constant time comparison for hashes

  - Minor test expansion

2.009001 2015-08-08

  - Support calling Crypt::Bcrypt::Easy->crypt as a class method

2.008002 2015-08-02

  - Bytes::Random::Secure::Tiny now defaults to seeding from nonblocking
    sources; fix our constructor call when 'strong' salts are enabled

2.008001 2015-07-02

  - Switch to Bytes::Random::Secure::Tiny

2.007001 2015-06-21

  - API change; passwdcmp now returns explicit undef rather than an empty
    list

  - API change; export mkpasswd and passwdcmp by default

  - Add 'reset_seed' option to Crypt::Bcrypt::Easy's constructor as sugar for
    calling 'mkpasswd_forked' at object construction time

2.006001 2015-06-21

  - Add 'mkpasswd_forked' function for resetting salt generator seeds in child
    processes or threads.

2.005004 2015-03-11

  - 'use strictures 2;' for saner fatal warnings behavior

  - Faster tests

2.005003 2014-12-02

  - Kill constant time comparison completely; this was a silly addition that
    has only introduced bugs.

  - Switch to 'cpanfile' dependency list

2.005002 2014-09-18

  - Better Crypt::Bcrypt::Easy documentation.

  - Improvements to constant time comparison.

  - Minor optimizations & cleanups.

2.005001 2014-09-11

  - SECURITY; passwdcmp() constant time comparison fixes.
    
    The last character of a hash can be skipped during constant time
    comparison in previous versions (starting at 1.82.4).
    
    Real-world risk is reasonably low, but this does make collisions more
    likely. Mea culpa.

  - POD / test expansion

2.004002 2014-05-12

  - Minor cleanups & test improvements

2.004001 2013-10-16

  - Fix MD5 failures on machines without Crypt::Passwd::XS

2.004000 2013-10-15

  - Add mkpasswd_available function for checking avail hash methods

2.003001 2013-10-14

  - Fix failing t/04_hashopts.t on machines without SHA support

  - Use Pod::Usage to provide --help / --usage / --man

2.003000 2013-10-13

  - Support for passing in a salt generator coderef
  
  - mkpasswd() can accept parameters via a HASH

2.002000 2013-09-12

  - Use Exporter::Tiny

2.001003 2013-09-01

  - No code changes; drop prereq to perl-5.6

2.001002 2013-08-09

  - No code changes; fix 'Changes' to match CPAN::Changes::Spec

2.001001 2013-06-18

  - Kill Term::ReadKey dependency entirely; instead use POSIX::Termios to turn
    off terminal echo.  (haarg clued me in to this in a conversation he was
    having with tobyink on irc.perl.org #web-simple -- thanks!)

2.001000 2013-05-02

  - Output `bmkpasswd` prompts to STDERR for more sensible redirection

  - Make Term::ReadKey optional and warn if we don't have it

2.000003 2013-04-21

  - Cleaner --bench output

  - POD/test cleanups

2.000002 2013-04-19

  - Fix single-digit work-cost adjustment

  - Crypt::Bcrypt::Easy:
    Add ->cost() method
    Possible to pass a 'type =>' to ->crypt()
    (undocumented -- bcrypt is your friend, use it)

2.000001 2013-04-19

  - Add Crypt::Bcrypt::Easy

1.082005 2013-04-08

  - Better passwdcmp() argument-checking

  - Trap dying 'crypt()' calls in tests to avoid fuzzy fails like
    http://www.cpantesters.org/cpan/report/be021b42-9e64-11e2-8d62-e95aab8f1a3b

1.082004 2013-04-05

  - Use constant time comparison when comparing hashes.

  - POD enhancements.

1.082003 2013-04-01

  - POD tweaks

1.082002 2013-02-23

  - Lazy-build Bytes::Random::Secure instances

1.082001 2013-02-23

  - Use Bytes::Random::Secure-0.24

1.082000 2013-02-17

  - Use NonBlocking => 1 unless --strong is specified

1.081002 2013-02-17

  - Fix stray reference to deprecated HAVE_PASSWD_XS in bin/bmkpasswd

1.081001 2013-02-17
 
  - Use Crypt::Random::Seed in blocking mode to generate salts securely.

1.07 2012-06-10

  - Slightly more sane Crypt::Passwd::XS checking.

  - Improved POD.

1.06 2012-06-09

  - Small t/ readability cleanup.

  - Missing changelog for 1.05.

1.05 2012-06-09

  - Skip MD5 tests on systems without Crypt::Passwd::XS or working MD5.

  - Fixes test failures on Windows builds without proper crypt(),
    MD5 is only included for compat with ancient hashes anyway.

1.04 2012-06-09

  - Fix a broken test on systems missing SHA support.

  - More consistent POD between bmkpasswd(1) and App::bmkpasswd

1.03 2012-06-08

  - croak() if specified work cost factor is not numeric.
  
  - croak() on unknown types.

  - Clean up an old check that is no longer relevant; have_sha() will now 
    do the Right Thing if Crypt::Passwd::XS is missing, so we don't need 
    to check if someone was stupidly futzing with package variables.

1.02 2012-06-08

  - Typo/style cleanups

1.01 2012-06-08

  - Try::Tiny rather than raw block eval, 'use strictures'

  - Improved tests

1.00 2012-05-23

  - Minor cleanups, 1.00

0.05 2012-04-07

  - t/04_sha: mention Crypt::Passwd::XS if SHA is missing

  - Include . / in standard salt possibles (MD5/SHA)

  - croak() rather than die() from bmkpasswd.pm

0.04 2012-04-02

  - Don't export mkpasswd/passwdcmp unless requested.

0.03 2012-03-29

  - First known-working CPAN-able dist; based on code pulled out of the
    Bot::Cobalt IRC bot, with POD updates, optional Crypt::Passwd::XS
    detection/use, better tests
