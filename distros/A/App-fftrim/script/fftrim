=head1 SYNOPSIS

C<fftrim --in 00001.MTS --out clip1.mp4 --start 15.5 --end 44:13>

C<fftrim --in "00001.MTS 00002.MTS" --out clip2.mp4 --start 44:13 --end 2-24:55>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<fftrim> processes raw videos from a camcorder by
concatenating, trimming and compressing them according to
arguments you supply on the command line, or in a F<CONTROL>
file.

Concatenation is performed using ffmpeg's "concat protocol".
This file-level concatenation is suitable for MTS files
generated by a Sony or Pansonic camera. 

=head1 Trimming a single file

C<fftrim --in 00001.MTS --out clip1.mp4 --start 15.5 --end 44:13>

=head1 Concatenating multiple source files

C<fftrim --in "00001.MTS 00002.MTS 00003.MTS" --out clip2.mp4 --start 44:13 --end 2-24:55>

C<fftrim --in "00001.MTS 00002.MTS 00003.MTS" --out clip3.mp4 --start 2-24:55 --end 3-1:05>

The expression C<2-24:55> means a position in the concatenated
file that includes the full length of the first clip and
24:55 of the second clip. Similarly, C<3-65> or
C<3-1:05> would mean a position of 1:05 into the third clip.

The source files are concatenated into an intermediate file
using the name of the first source file appended with .mp4.

=head1 Batch mode

C<fftrim --source-dir raw --target-dir final>

It's probably better to try with the -n or -m flag first.

C<fftrim -n --source-dir raw --target-dir final>

There is also some simple error checking, and fftrim
will abort if errors are found in the CONTROL file.

=head1 CONTROL file format

The CONTROL file used for batch processing
appears in the same directory as the source
video files. It contains multiple lines
of the following format:

    # source file(s)    output file   start  end
    # ---------------   -----------   -----  ----
      00001.MTS       : part1.mp4   : 15.5 : 44:13 

Arguments are separated by a colon character flanked by
whitespace. Commented lines are ignored.

The following line creates F<part2.mp4> from source files
F<00001.MTS> and F<00002.MTS>:

    00001.MTS 00002.MTS : part2.mp4 :  44:13 : 2-24:55 

=head1 Profiles

F<$HOME/.fftrim> is the directory for profiles, 
which are text files containing ffmpeg options. 

Adding C<--profile highres> to the command line will
merge options from the file F<$HOME/.fftrim/highres>.

Be sure to look at F<$HOME/.fftrim/default>. These options are
are merged by default, that is when C<--profile> is not supplied.
Please change them to suit yourself.
