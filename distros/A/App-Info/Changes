Revision history for Perl extension App::Info.

0.57  2011-06-19T06:14:46
      - Removed `Makefile.PL`. It used Module::Build internally, which is
        deprecated.
      - Moved repository to [GitHub](https://github.com/theory/app-info/).
      - Added repository and bug reporting metadata.

0.56  2011-02-22T21:02:39
      - Added `cgibin_physical()` and `cgibin_virtual()` to
        SVN::Notify::HTTPD::Apache. Patch from Martin Thurn.
      - Removed some superfluous `use Config;`s.
      - Added workaround for a bizarre crash when accessing `%Config` via
        `grep` on ActivePerl
        ([bug](http://bugs.activestate.com/show_bug.cgi?id=89447)). Thanks to
        Christian Walde for the analysis.
      - Fixed warning in `t/apache_info.t`.

0.55  2008-07-18T16:18:12
      - Fixed some test failures on Windows boxes with PostgreSQL installed.
        Patch from Taro Nishino.

0.54  2008-05-18T04:01:50
      - Added the doc_root() method to App::Info::HTTPD::Apache. Patch
        from Martin Thurn.
      - Added an undistributed spell-checking test, which means that the
        documentation has many fewer spelling errors.

0.53  2008-05-05T17:47:18
      - Added the "configure_requires" and "build_requires" parameters to
        Build.PL.
      - Updated Copyright.

0.52  2007-08-13T18:24:54
      - Fixed test failures on Win32 in 't/util.t.' Reported by Alex Chorny
        via the cpan-testers mail list.
      - Fixed test failure in 't/util.t' for those who happen to have an
        INTERCAL compiler installed. Reported by David Cantrell.

0.51  2006-09-25T17:52:53
      - Really fixed the unsorted test failure by putting the sort in the
        right place.
      - The code that creates the 't/scripts' directory now runs during the
        'code' action rather than the 'build' action, allowing the tests to
        run properly when the 'build' action has not been run. Reported By
        Alex Chorny (Ticket # 21281).
      - Fixed test failures under bleedperl where Carp was not properly
        loaded. Reported by Andreas Koenig (Ticket # 21641).
      - "OS-Dependent" skipped tests in 't/util.t' are no longer OS dependent
        or skipped.

0.50  2006-09-15T23:52:17
      - Fixed test failures due to lack of sorting of files and directories
        returned by files_in_dir() on some platforms.
      - Fixed documentation in App::Info::HTTPD::Apache so that a line of hash
        symbols (#s) doesn't show up in the docs. This actually created an
        error in man pages. Reported by Nacho Barrientos.

0.49  2006-04-08T05:35:31
      - Fixed typos in App::Info::HTTPD::Apache.
      - Changed keys for Apache executables such as apxs from, e.g., "apache
        apxs" to "path to apxs".
      - Added the value returned by Apache2::BuildConfig->new->{APXS_BINDIR},
        if Apache2::Build config is installed, to the list of bin directories
        returned by search_bin_dirs() in App::Info::HTTPD::Apache.
      - Added "httpd2" to the list of names returned by search_exe_names() in
        App::Info::HTTPD::Apache.
      - Fixed tests in t/apache_info.t to pass on Windows.

0.48  2006-02-05T03:09:38
      - Added support for Apache2 to App::Info::HTTPD::Apache.
      - Added files_in_dir() method to App::Info::Util to get a list of all of
        the files in a directory.
      - Added shared_mods() method to App::Info::HTTPD::Apache for getting a
        list of shared object libraries compiled for Apache.
      - The mod_perl() method of App::Info::HTTPD::Apache now also checks the
        shared object libraries to determine whether mod_perl is supported by
        the installed Apache.
      - Corrected some documentation pastos in App::Info::Lib::OSSPUUID.
      - Added perl_module() method to App::Info::Lib::OSSPUUID, since the OSSP
        library might be installed, but not OSSP::uuid.

0.47  2005-12-05T22:56:12
      - Fixed "use lib" line in Makefile.PL caused by a bug in Module::Build.

0.46  2005-12-05T22:43:20
      - Added App::Info::Lib::OSSPUUID for information about the OSSP
        UUID library.

0.45  2005-11-08T05:57:05
      - Added "key" attribute to handler request objects.
      - Changed the handler key names for each subclass to more command-line
        friendly versions, such as "path to httpd" instead of just
        "executable". Just `tr/ /-/` to make them into command-line options.

0.44  2005-01-08T00:29:03
      - Yet another fix for test failures on Win32, this time for PostgreSQL.
      - Fixed SQLite tests for DBD::SQLite (which is used to collect
        informationto when the SQLite executable can't be found) work
        properly.
      - Added workaround for strange bug on Perl 5.005_04 where handlers
        assigned to an App::Info object after its creation would be
        prompty forgotten. Reported by Yuval Kogman, who also gave me
        a login to a server with Perl 5.005_04 to fix the problem.

0.43  2004-12-14T19:45:52
      - Added "search_*_name" parameters and methods for searching for
        PostgreSQL and Apache executables other than the main one,
        which is already handed by "search_exe_names".
      - Fixed "apache.t", "iconv.t", "postgres.t", and "sqlite3.t" tests
        on Win32.

0.42  2004-12-07T00:40:53
      - Fixed last Win32 test failure in "apache.t".
      - Added "executable()" method to return the main executable of an app or
        library, if there is one.
      - Added other executable methods to App::Info::RDBMS::PostgreSQL,
        including "postgres()", "createdb()", "createuser()", and others.
      - Added other executable methods to App::Info::HTTPD::Apache,
        including "ab()", "apachectl()", "apxs()", and others.
      - Changed behavior of App::Info::HTTPD::Apache->bin_dir to just return
        the name of the directory in which the httpd executable is stored,
        rather than a possible "bin" directory under the httpd_root.

0.41  2004-11-28T20:01:57
      - Fixed Apache, SQLite, and Iconv tests to pass under Win32.
      - Fixed "bin_dir()" method for Apache module to return the same
        directory as "httpd_root()" on Win32.

0.40  2004-11-27T19:45:01
      - Eliminated "Odd number of elements in hash assignment" warning when
        creating an App::Info::Handler::Prompt object.
      - Changed SQLite event messages to simply refer to "SQLite" instead
        of "sqlite3 or sqlite".
      - Added new parameters to "new()", along with accompanying accessors to
        collect their values: "search_exe_names", "search_bin_dirs",
        "search_lib_names", "search_so_lib_names", search_lib_dirs",
        "search_inc_names", and "search_inc_dirs". These are array references,
        and their values are used to search for application files on the local
        file system. Users can now override the directories ande files that
        the classes search for with their own values. Subclasses override the
        accessor methods to provide such values.
      - Updated subclases to use the new "search" methods.
      - Added "search_conf_names" and "search_conf_dirs" parameters and
        methods to App::Info::HTTPD::Apache to allow users to affect the
        file names paths used to search for Apache configuration files.
      - Added support for finding iconv on Win32.

0.30  2004-11-20T19:10:55
      - Fixed number of tests to skip in "sqlite_info.t" for systems that
        don't have SQLite installed. Reported by numerous CPAN testers.
      - Fixed carp.t to be compatable with older Perls.
      - Added new C<lib_dirs()> method to App::Info::Util to centrally handle
        the parsing and returning of typical library directories as defined by
        the "libsdirs" and "loclibpth" Config settings.
      - Added /sw/lib to the list of library diretories to search for
        SQLite libraries.
      - Only loading DBI in App::Info::RDBMS::SQLite if a version of
        DBD::SQLite is known to be installed, rather than at compile
        time.
      - Fixed tests in sqlite_info.t to work properly on Windows.

0.29  2004-11-20T00:09:22
      - Added App::Info::RDBMS::SQLite to the MANIFEST so that it will
        actually show up in the distribution!

0.28  2004-11-19T23:35:25
      - Added App::Info::RDBMS::SQLite.

0.27  2004-11-19T02:27:50
      - Now using quotes when passing an executable path to `` in the
        Apache and PostgreSQL libraries so that they work properly when
        there are spaces in the path (such as on Windows). Reported by
        Geoff Richards.
      - Added "configure()" method to the PostgreSQL library. From the
        DBD::Pg project.
      - Added Windows support to the PostgreSQL module.

0.26  2004-11-03T17:53:58
      - Added new path to list of paths to search for PostgreSQL. The new
        path, /usr/lib/postgresql/bin, is used by at least one Debian package.
        Submitted by Cinly Ooi.
      - Added support for Apache on Windows. Patch from Ron Savage.

0.25  Thu Dec 11 20:50:43 2004
      - Fixed parsing of version numbers for new releases of PostgreSQL,
        which don't include the ".0" patch version in their version numbers.

0.24  Tue Aug 26 00:58:55 2004
      - Fixed broken link in App::Info::Request documentation.
      - Added PostgreSQL environment variables to the paths to search
        for pg_config in App::Info::RDBMS::PostgreSQL. Patch from
        Greg Sabino Mullane.
      - Added handling of PostgreSQL beta version numbers to
        App::Info::RDBMS::PostgreSQL. Patch from Greg Sabino Mullane.
      - Switched to Module::Build.

0.23  Thu Aug  8 19:32:42 2002
      - Fixed tests that check Apache info events so that they're more
        flexible about the name of the Apache executable. Thanks to Dave
        Rolsky for the spot.
      - Fixed "NAME" section in App::Info::Request so that it has the right
        name and therefore renders properly on search.cpan.org.
      - Updated or added "BUGS" section of documentation in all modules to
        point to the CPAN Request Tracker.

0.22  Wed Jul  3 17:31:53 2002
      - Fixed tests that use Handler::Prompt so that they fake it into
        always thinking there's a TTY.

0.21  Tue Jul  2 19:14:44 2002
      - Fixed bug in Handler::Prompt where the prompt failed to simply
        return when the user accepted the default value (with confirm
        events).
      - Changed email address in AUTHOR section so that it's a link.
      - Added tests for confirm events.

0.20  Thu Jun 27 20:28:34 2002
      - Major upgrade. Some backwards compatibility broken. Namely, the
        error parameter no longer exists. See event handling instead.
      - Added App::Info::Handler. Classes derived from this class handle
        events triggered by App::Info subclasses.      
      - Added event handling methods to App::Info base class. The methods
        are on_info(), on_error(), on_unknown(), and on_confirm(). They
        have constructor parameters, too, of the same names. Pass in a
        list of event handlers to any one of these methods to handle
        events of that type.
      - Added example event handling classes. They are
        App::Info::Handler::Carp, App::Info::Handler::Print, and
        App::Info::Handler::Prompt. Objects of these classes may be passed
        to any of the event handling methods listed above.
      - Added App::Info::Request. Objects of this class are passed to event
        handler objects' handler() method as the sole argument. The request
        object holds significant information about the request so that a
        handler knows what to do with a a request.
      - Added protected event triggering methods to App::Info. These are
        info(), error(), unknown(), and confirm(). If a subclass calls one
        of these methods, a request will be created and passed off to the
        list of available handlers (if any) to process the request and,
        in the case of unknown() and confirm(), return data to the App::Info
        subclass.
      - Refactored example subclasses to use the new event methods. Changed
        subclasses are App::Info::HTTPD::Apache, App::Info::RDBMS::PostgreSQL,
        App::Info::Lib::Expat, and App::Info::Lib::Iconv.
      - Wrote extensive documentation describing how to use the event methods
        both in App::Info subclasses and in App::Info clients.
      - Incremented all version numbers to 0.20.
      - Wrote extensive tests to test all features.

0.13  Sat Jun  8 21:17:40 2002
      - Fixed Lib::Iconv so that version() would properly return undef when
        no include directory was found.

0.12  Sat Jun  8 20:32:38 2002
      - Now more silly-proof! Fixed util.t test so that people who actually
        have directories named, e.g., "/foo", will still have their tests
        pass. Thanks to Arthur Bergman for the spot.
      - Fixed Lib::Expat so that version() would properly return undef when
        no include directory was found. Thanks to Arthur Bergman for the spot.
      - Fixed $VERSION in Info.pm to be available to pre-5.6.0 perls.

0.11  Sat Jun  8 05:49:40 2002
      - Improved validation for the error_level parameter.
      - In distribution tests, no longer testing to see that user and group
        methods in HTTP::Apache return values when Apache is installed, as
        sometimes folks don't have User and Group directives set in their
        httpd.conf files. Grrr...
      - Fixed bare word references in Makefile.PL.

0.10  Wed Jun  5 23:58:54 2002
      - Added new error_level parameter to new(). This tells App::Info objects
        how to handle errors on an object-by-object basis. The new base class
        method error() is for subclasses to use for throwing errors, and
        last_error() is for client code to access the last error in non-fatal
        error modes. See App::Info for complete documentation. This is the
        major change the triggered the (mild) version number jump.
      - Reworked all application subclasses to use the new error() method.
      - Changed all application subclasses so that they're no longer singleton
        classes. Each new object construction looks for application metadata
        all over again.
      - Updated documentation on subclassing to reflect changes.
      - Added first_exe() and first_cat_exe() to App::Info::Util. Changed
        RDBMS::PostgreSQL, HTTP::Apache, and Lib::Iconv to use them.
      - Added more directories in which to search for the Apache server
        executable, thanks to work by Dave Rolsky.

0.06  Wed Jun  5 15:36:36 2002
      - Fixed all version tests in test scripts to check for definedness
        rather than truth, so that version numbers that are "0" will be
        ok. Thanks to Andy Lester for the spot.
      - Util now properly loads File::Spec rather than File::Spec::Functions.
      - Changed how the version number gets stored in Lib::Expat so that it
        only gets saved if all three version number parts are found.

0.05  Wed Jun  5 00:01:57 2002
      - Eliminated possible "Use of uninitialized value in concatenation (.)
        or string" warning from Lib::Expat.
      - Eliminated possible "Use of uninitialized value in hex" warning from
        Lib::Iconv.
      - Fixed issue where RDBMS::PostgreSQL would try to execute pg_config
        even when it didn't exist.
      - Added To Do list.
      - Made iconv.t and expat.t tests for version numbers safer for CPAN
        distribution. Patches with improved methods of determining version
        numbers for those libraries are welcome.

0.04  Tue Jun  4 01:03:58 2002
      - Wrote documentation on subclassing App::Info.
      - Added httpd_root() abstract method to App::Info::HTTPD abstract
        base class.
      - Added httpd_conf(), user(), group(), and port() methods to
        App::Info::HTTPD::Apche.
      - Added and corrected documentation in App::Info::HTTPD,
        App::Info::RDBMS, and App::Info::Lib.
      - Made minor documentation fixes to other classes.
      - Fixed methods in App::Info::Util to return undef in a scalar context
        if there were no regular expression matches.

0.03  Mon Jun  3 18:37:50 2002
      - Private release.
      - Changed first_cat_file() to first_cat_path() in App::Info::Util.
      - Added internal tests for various subclasses.
      - Fixed a bunch of bugs.
      - Added better support for Fink-installed libraries on Darwin.

0.02  Mon Jun  3 04:38:24 2002
      - Private release.
      - Added Expat.pm.
      - Many changes to Util.

0.01  Fri May 31 07:54:55 2002
      - Original version.
      - Private release.
