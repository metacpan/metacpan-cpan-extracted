NAME
    Algorithm::LossyCount - Memory-efficient approximate frequency count.

VERSION
    version 0.03

SYNOPSIS
      use strict;
      use warnings;
      use Algorithm::LossyCount;
  
      my @samples = qw/a b a c d f a a d b b c a a .../;
  
      my $counter = Algorithm::LossyCount->new(max_error_ratio => 0.005);
      $counter->add_sample($_) for @samples;
  
      my $frequencies = $counter->frequencies;
      say $frequencies->{a};  # Approximate freq. of 'a'.
      say $frequencies->{b};  # Approximate freq. of 'b'.
      ...

DESCRIPTION
    Lossy-Counting is a approximate frequency counting algorithm proposed by
    Manku and Motwani in 2002 (refer "SEE ALSO" section below.)

    The main advantage of the algorithm is memory efficiency. You can get
    approximate count of appearance of items with very low memory footprint,
    compared with total inspection. Furthermore, Lossy-Counting is an online
    algorithm. It is applicable to data set such that the size is unknown,
    and you can take intermediate result anytime.

METHODS
  new(max_error_ratio => $num)
    Construcotr. "max_error_ratio" is the only mandatory parameter, that
    specifies acceptable error ratio. It is an error that give zero or a
    negative number as the value.

  add_sample($sample)
    Add given $sample to count.

  frequencies([support => $num])
    Returns current result as HashRef. Its keys and values are samples and
    corresponding counts respectively.

    If optional named parameter "support" is specified, returned HashRef
    will contain only samples having frequency greater than "($support -
    $max_error_ratio) * $num_samples".

  max_error_ratio
    Returns "max_error_ratio" you've given to the constructor.

  num_samples
    Returns the total number of samples you've added.
