perlrpcgen is a program to generate Perl extensions from ONC RPC
interface descriptions. See 'perldoc perlrpcgen' for full details.

Installation

    1. perl Makefile.PL

    2. make

    3. make install

The Makefile will put perlrpcgen in your Perl scripts directory, and
some modules it uses in your Perl site library.

There is an example client and server in dict/. See the README there.

Please send bug reports or any other feedback to <jake@organic.com>. I
would love to hear from you if you use perlrpcgen and find it useful.

Changes since 0.7a:

  Renamed RPC module to RPC::ONC.
