NAME
    CHI::Driver::DBI - Use DBI for cache storage

VERSION
    version 1.27

SYNOPSIS
        use CHI;
    
        # Supply a DBI handle
        #
        my $cache = CHI->new( driver => 'DBI', dbh => DBI->connect(...) );
    
        # or a DBIx::Connector
        #
        my $cache = CHI->new( driver => 'DBI', dbh => DBIx::Connector->new(...) );
    
        # or code that generates a DBI handle
        #
        my $cache = CHI->new( driver => 'DBI', dbh => sub { ...; return $dbh } );

DESCRIPTION
    This driver uses a database table to store the cache. The newest
    versions of MySQL and SQLite work are known to work. Other RDBMSes
    should work.

    Why cache things in a database? Isn't the database what people are
    trying to avoid with caches? This is often true, but a simple primary
    key lookup is extremely fast in many databases and this provides a
    shared cache that can be used when less reliable storage like memcached
    is not appropriate. Also, the speed of simple lookups on MySQL when
    accessed over a local socket is very hard to beat. DBI is fast.
