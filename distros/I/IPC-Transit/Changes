1.161300  2016-05-09 16:18:28-07:00 America/Los_Angeles
    - Apologies in advance for a big increase in dependencies.
    - Changed command-line utilities rtrans and strans to print and parse
      JSON instead of Perl, respectively.
    - Increased the amount of information qtrans reports.
    - Generally refactored remote transit to be far more CPU and memory
      efficient.
    - Added serialization type Sereal, which is the fastest available for
      Perl at this time.
    - (INCOMPATIBLE) Changed default serialization from JSON to Sereal.  Be
      careful with this one if you use IPC::Transit between different
      languages.  You probably want to specify JSON in that case.
    - Added large message handling via local file cache.
    - Added some simplistic DNS caching.
    - Removed some ancient and needless tests.
    - Ported the reference remote transit gateway program to use plack.
