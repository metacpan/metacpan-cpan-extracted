NAME
    Dist::Util - Dist-related utilities

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.06 of Dist::Util (from Perl
    distribution Dist-Util), released on 2014-12-26.

SYNOPSIS
     use Dist::Util qw(
         list_dist_modules
         list_dists
         packlist_for
     );

     say packlist_for("Text::ANSITable"); # sample output: /home/steven/perl5/perlbrew/perls/perl-5.18.2/lib/site_perl/5.18.2/x86_64-linux/auto/Text/ANSITable/.packlist
     my @mods = list_dist_modules("Text::ANSITable"); # -> ("Text::ANSITable", "Text::ANSITable::BorderStyle::Default", "Text::ANSITable::ColorTheme::Default")

DESCRIPTION
FUNCTIONS
  packlist_for($mod) => STR
    Find ".packlist" file for installed module $mod (which can be in the
    form of "Package::SubPkg" or "Package/SubPkg.pm"). Return undef if none
    is found.

    Depending on the content of @INC, the returned path may be absolute or
    relative.

  list_dists() => LIST
    Find all ".packlist" files in @INC and then pick the dist names from the
    paths, because ".packlist" files are put in:

     $INC/$Config{archname}/auto/Foo/Bar/.packlist

    Caveat: many Linux distributions strip ".packlist" files.

  list_dist_modules($mod) => LIST
    Given installed module name $mod (which must be the name of the main
    module of its distribution), list all the modules in the distribution.
    This is done by first finding the ".packlist" file, then look at all the
    ".pm" files listed in the packlist.

    Will return empty list if fails to get the packlist.
