NAME
    CLDR::Number - Localized number formatters using the Unicode CLDR

VERSION
    This document describes CLDR::Number v0.19, built with Unicode CLDR v29.

SYNOPSIS
        use CLDR::Number;

        # new object with 'es' (Spanish) locale
        $cldr = CLDR::Number->new(locale => 'es');

        # decimals
        $decf = $cldr->decimal_formatter;

        # when locale is 'es' (Spanish)
        say $decf->format(1234.5);  # '1234,5'

        # when locale is 'es-MX' (Mexican Spanish)
        say $decf->format(1234.5);  # '1,234.5'

        # when locale is 'ar' (Arabic)
        say $decf->format(1234.5);  # '١٬٢٣٤٫٥'

        # percents
        $perf = $cldr->percent_formatter;

        # when locale is 'tr' (Turkish)
        say $perf->format(0.05);  # '%5'

        # currencies
        $curf = $cldr->currency_formatter(currency_code => 'USD');

        # when locale is 'en' (English) and currency is USD (US dollars)
        say $curf->format(9.99);  # '$9.99'

        # when locale is 'en-CA' (Canadian English) and currency is USD
        say $curf->format(9.99);  # 'US$9.99'

        # when locale is 'fr-CA' (Canadian French) and currency is USD
        say $curf->format(9.99);  # '9,99 $ US'

DEPRECATION
    Using the "locale" method as a setter is deprecated. In the future the
    object’s locale will become immutable. Please see issue #38
    <https://github.com/patch/cldr-number-pm5/issues/38> for details and to
    submit comments or concerns.

DESCRIPTION
    Software localization includes much more than just translations.
    Numbers, prices, and even percents should all be localized based on the
    user’s language, script, and region. Fortunately, the Unicode Common
    Locale Data Repository (CLDR) provides locale data and specifications
    for formatting numeric data to use with many of the world’s locales.

    This class provides common attributes shared among the supported
    formatter classes as well as methods to instantiate decimal, percent,
    and currency formatter objects. The value for any attribute (such as
    locale or decimal_sign) will be passed to the formatter objects on
    instantiation but can be overwritten by manually passing another value
    for the attribute or calling a setter method on the formatter object.

  Methods
    decimal_formatter
        Returns a decimal formatter, which is a
        CLDR::Number::Format::Decimal object instantiated with all of the
        attributes from your CLDR::Number object as well as any attributes
        passed to this method.

    percent_formatter
        Returns a percent formatter, which is a
        CLDR::Number::Format::Percent object instantiated with all of the
        attributes from your CLDR::Number object as well as any attributes
        passed to this method.

    currency_formatter
        Returns a currency formatter, which is a
        CLDR::Number::Format::Currency object instantiated with all of the
        attributes from your CLDR::Number object as well as any attributes
        passed to this method.

  Common Attributes
    These are common attributes among this class and all formatter classes.
    All attributes other than locale, default_locale, and cldr_version have
    defaults that change depending on the current locale. All string
    attributes are expected to be character strings, not byte strings.

    locale
        Default: value of default_locale attribute if it exists, otherwise
        "root"

        Valid: Unicode locale identifiers

        Examples: "es" (Spanish), "es-ES" (European Spanish), "es-419"
        (Latin American Spanish), "zh-Hant" (Traditional Chinese), "zh-Hans"
        (Simplified Chinese), "chr" (Cherokee)

        The locale is case-insensitive and can use either "-" (hyphen-minus)
        or "_" (low line) as a separator.

    default_locale
        Default: none

        Valid: Unicode locale identifiers

        Use this if you want a locale other than the generic "root" if the
        locale attribute is not set or not valid.

    numbering_system
        Valid: currently only decimal numbering systems are supported

        Examples: "latn" (Western Digits), "arab" (Arabic-Indic Digits),
        "hanidec" (Chinese Decimal Numerals), "fullwide" (Full Width Digits)

        In the future, algorithmic numbering systems like "hant"
        (Traditional Chinese Numerals), "hebr" (Hebrew Numerals), and
        "roman" (Roman Numerals) will be supported.

        The numbering system may alternately be provided as a Unicode locale
        extension subtag. For example, locale "ja-u-nu-fullwide" for the
        Japanese language ("ja") with the numbering system ("nu") set to
        Full Width Digits ("fullwide").

    decimal_sign
        Examples: "." (full stop) for root, en; "," (comma) for de, fr

    group_sign
        Examples: "," (comma) for root, en; "." (full stop) for de; " "
        (no-break space) for fr

    plus_sign
        Examples: "+" (plus sign) for root, en, and most locales

    minus_sign
        Examples: "-" (hyphen-minus) for root, en, and most locales

    infinity
        Examples: "∞" (infinity) for root, en, and almost all locales

    nan Examples: "NaN" for root, en, and most locales; many other
        variations for individual locales like "не число" for ru and "非數值"
        for zh-Hant

    cldr_version
        Value: 29

        This is a read-only attribute that will always reflect the currently
        supported Unicode CLDR version.

NOTES
    The Unicode private-use characters U+F8F0 through U+F8F4 are used
    internally and are therefore not supported in custom patterns and signs.
