=head1 NAME

Image::MetaData::JPEG::TagLists - a collection of tag tables for JPEG segments

=head1 OVERVIEW

This document contains a collection of tag tables for JPEG segments; it is an
appendix to the main manual page of the L<Image::MetaData::JPEG> module, which
the reader should refer to for further details and the general scope.

=head1 Valid tags for Exif APP1 data

The Japan Electronics and Information Technology Industries Association
(JEITA) set up a standard for an exchange format for digital still cameras
pictures, known as Exif. This standard defines a structure for embedding
meta-data in a JPEG picture, to be written in the APP1 segment. The
generalities and the reference documents about this structure are
introduced in the L<Structure|Image::MetaData::JPEG::Structures/Structure
of an Exif APP1 segment> appendix; this section and its subsections list
the valid interoperability record tags as well as their format.

=head2 Canonical Exif 2.2 and TIFF 6.0 tags for IFD0 and IFD1

In general, IFD0 and IFD1 can host tags from the same set. These tags are
divided in three categories: canonical, additional and registered to
companies. The tags listed in the following table are to be considered
canonical; they are described at length in the Exif standard document, and
can be found both in the IFD0 and in the IFD1 (some of them, in fact, must
be present in both directories). The 'class' column carries the tag class;
possible values are: A (image data structure), B (offsets), C (image data
characteristics), D (other tags) and P (pointers to other IFDs). The two
following columns show tag hexadecimal codes and names. The 'type' column
specifies the (always unsigned) tag type: I (short or long), S (short), L
(long), R (rational) and A (ASCII, always null terminated). The 'count'
column obviously carries the tag count ('-' for a variable count, either
because it is a variable length string or because it depends on other tags).

The 'IFD0' and 'IFD1' columns specify the support level in the respective
directory; each column comprises four letters, because both the primary
image (IFD0) and the thumbnail (IFD1) can come in four varieties
(uncompressed chunky, uncompressed planar, uncompressed YCC and JPEG
compressed). This module currently focuses only on JPEG pictures (not
TIFF), so only the fourth letter of the 'IFD0' column is interesting, but
note that the thumbnail of a JPEG image can be uncompressed. The support
level codes stand for: M (mandatory), R (recommended), O (optional), N
(not_recorded) and J (included in JPEG marker and so not recorded).

The 'thumbnail-only' column shows a 'T' for those records which cannot be
set/changed by the user exception made during a thumbnail update action
(and some of them are calculated automatically anyway). Note that, in some
cases, it is possible to set a tag when its support level is 'N' (e.g., the
YCbCr stuff in IFD1): picture displaying programs should however simply
ignore it. Some other tags, concerning offsets or thumbnail specific
information, cannot be set by the module user (they are calculated
automatically, more reliably): these are marked by 'calculated' in the
notes, or by a 'T' in the thumbnail-only column.

  Notes:

  1) The image description is a string containing a title or a comment for
     the image and all characters must be one byte long. When a two-byte
     code is necessary, the Exif Private tag 'UserComment' is to be used
     (see L</Exif tags for the 0th IFD Exif private subdirectory>).
  2) The image orientation is defined with respect to first row and the
     first column, according to the following table (values not listed here
     are reserved and should not be used); the default value is 1.
          ------------------------       ------------------------
          val. 0th row  0th column       val. 0th row  0th column
          ----|--------|----------       ----|--------|----------
           1    top      left             5    left     top
           2    top      right            6    right    top
           3    bottom   right            7    right    bottom
           4    bottom   left             8    left     bottom
          ------------------------       ------------------------
  3) The 'XResolution' and 'YResolution' tags indicate the number of pixels
     per resolution unit (given by the 'ResolutionUnit' tag) along the
     image width or height respectively. The resolution unit can be only 2
     (inches) or 3 (centimetres), all other values being reserved. When
     the resolution is not set, a value of 72 dots/inch is assumed.
  4) This indicates whether pixel components are recorded in chunky (1,
     default) or planar (2) format (only for TIFF images; JPEG compressed
     files use a JPEG marker instead); all other values are reserved.
  5) 'TransferFunction', 'WhitePoint' and 'PrimaryChromaticities' specify,
     respectively, a transfer function for the image in tabular style
     (3*256 short integers), the chromaticity of the white point, and the
     chromaticity of the three primary colours of the image. Normally these
     tags are not necessary, since the colour space is specified in the
     'ColorSpace' L<private Exif tag|/Exif tags for the 0th IFD Exif
     private subdirectory>.
  6) This tag indicates the time of the "image creation" (i.e., the time
     the file was last changed). The tag value is a null terminated string
     of the form "YYYY:MM:DD HH:MM:SS" (note the space in the middle and
     the colon signs), in 24-hour format. If the tag is set, but the value
     is not meaningful, all numbers should be set to spaces (replacing also
     the colons with spaces is permitted too). See also 'DateTimeOriginal'
     and 'DateTimeDigitized' in the SubIFD L<section|/Exif tags for the 0th
     IFD Exif private subdirectory>. [Currently, only years after 1800 can
     be set with this Perl module].
  7) Digital images are often displayed on RGB devices, but recorded data
     can be saved in a YCbCr colour space because of the JPEG
     compression. The Exif standard provides three tags for translating one
     space into the other (see the sYCC IEC standard for more details).
     'YCbCrSubSampling' is the sampling ratio of the chrominance components
     in relation to the luminance component; its value can be only [2, 1]
     (for YCbCr 4:2:2) or [2, 2] (for YCbCr 4:2:0). In JPEG compressed data
     a JPEG marker is used instead of this tag. 'YCbCrPositioning' is the
     position of the chrominance components in relation to the luminance
     component, and is meaningful only for JPEG compressed data or
     uncompressed YCbCr data; its value can be only 1 (centred, default) or
     2 (co-sited). 'YCbCrCoefficients' contains the matrix coefficients for
     the transformation from RGB to YCbCr image data.
  8) This tags contains the reference values for the black and white points
     of the image. No defaults are given in the TIFF standard, but Exif
     assumes the following values: [0, 255, 0, 255, 0, 255] (when
     'PhotometricInterpretation' is RGB) or [0, 255, 0, 128, 0, 128] (when
     'PhotometricInterpretation' is YCbCr).

=head2 Additional TIFF 6.0 tags not in Exif 2.2 for IFD0

The tags listed in the following table are present in the TIFF 6.0 standard
and not in the Exif 2.2 standard. They are presented here just for
reference, since some digital cameras or programs still include them,
incorrectly, in the IFD0 (they are not present in IFD1, I assume). The
'class' column carries the tag class; possible values are: a (TIFF 6.0 tags
for baseline TIFFs not in Exif 2.2), b (extensions to TIFF 6.0 specs not in
Exif 2.2) and '-' (updates and corrections to TIFF 6.0). The two following
columns show tag hexadecimal codes and names. The 'type' column specifies
the tag type: i (byte or short), I (short or long), B (byte), S (short), L
(long), R (rational), F (floating point numbers), D (double precision
floating point numbers), '-' (unspecified, best fit) and A (ASCII, always
null terminated). The 'count' column obviously carries the tag count ('-'
that it is variable, either because it is a variable length string or
because it depends on other tags).

=head2 Exif tags assigned to companies for IFD0 and IFD1

The tags listed in the following table, all with a value larger than
0x8000, i.e. 32000, were requested by individual companies and assigned to
them by the TIFF committee; well, at least I think, because it is very
difficult to have an official list for these tags, so that they should be
considered at the level of "rumours". This list also includes some TIFF/IT
tags from ISO 12639 and some TIFF/EP tags from ISO 12234 (private Exif tags
in JPEG APP1 originated from TIFF/EP, so there is a large intersection:
TIFF/EP tags which are also Exif are not listed here).

=head2 Exif tags for the 0th IFD Exif private subdirectory

The tags listed in the following table are all the Exif 2.2 private tags,
i.e., those which populate the 0th IFD SubIFD; they are described at length
in the Exif L<standard document|Image::MetaData::JPEG::Structures/Structure
of an Exif APP1 segment> (but see also the non-standard Photoshop SubIFD
tags at the end of this section). The 'class' column carries the tag class;
possible values are: a (tags relating to version), b (image data
characteristics), c (image configuration), d (user information), e (related
file information), f (date and time), g (picture taking conditions) and h
(other Exif 2.2 tags). The two following columns show tag hexadecimal codes
and names. The 'type' column specifies the tag type: I (short or long), S
(short), L (long), R (rational), SR (signed rational), U (undefined) and A
(ASCII, always null terminated). The 'count' column obviously carries the
tag count ('-' means that it is variable).

The 'SubIFD' column specifies the support level; it comprises four letters,
because the primary image (IFD0) can come in four varieties (uncompressed
chunky, uncompressed planar, uncompressed YCC and JPEG compressed). This
module currently focuses only on JPEG pictures (not TIFF), so only the
fourth letter is interesting. The support level codes stand for: M
(mandatory), R (recommended), O (optional), and N (not recorded). Tags
marked as 'calculated' in the notes must not be set by the module user,
since they concern offsets and data types (which are calculated
automatically, more reliably).

  Notes:
  1) The camera information in the Exif standard conforms to the APEX
     (Additive System of Photographic Exposure) unit system. APEX is a
     convenient unit for expressing exposure (Ev). The relation of APEX
     to other units is essentially as follows:
     --------------------------------------------------------
     ApertureValue     (Av) = 2 log2(FNumber)
     ShutterSpeedValue (Tv) = - log2(ExposureTime)
     BrightnessValue   (Bv) =   log2(Brightness) + constant
     FilmSensitivity   (Sv) =   log2(ASA/3.125) [not in Exif]
     Exposure          (Ev) = Av + Tv = Bv + Sv
     --------------------------------------------------------
  2) A version tag is a sequence of four numerical characters representing
     the supported version of the standard (e.g., '0220' for version 2.2).
     Possible versions for Exif: 1.0, 1.1, 2.0, 2.1, 2.2 and 2.2.1.
     Possible versions for Flashpix: 1.0.
  3) These tags indicate the time of the original-image data generation and
     of its storage (hardly any difference, usually). Their value is a
     null terminated string of the form "YYYY:MM:DD HH:MM:SS" (note the
     space in the middle and the colon signs), in 24-hour format. If the
     tag is set, but the value is not meaningful, all numbers should be set
     to spaces (replacing also the colons with spaces is permitted
     too). See also 'DateTime' in the canonical tag L<section|/Canonical
     Exif 2.2 and TIFF 6.0 tags for IFD0 and IFD1>. [Currently, only years
     after 1800 can be set with this Perl module].
  4) This tag indicates the channels of each component, arranged in order
     from the 1st component to the 4th. For uncompressed data the data
     arrangement is given in the 'PhotometricInterpretation' tag. The four
     numeric characters must be in the range '0' - '6', and legal combina-
     tions are '4560' (if RGB uncompressed) and '1230' (all other cases).
  5) This tag indicates the status of flash when the image was shot.
     Bit 0 indicates the flash firing status, bits 1 and 2 indicate the
     flash return status, bits 3 and 4 indicate the flash mode, bit 5
     indicates whether the flash function is present, and bit 6 indicates
     "red eye" mode. The allowed decimal values for the bit-mask are
     therefore 0, 1, 5, 7, 9, 13, 15, 16, 24, 25, 29, 31, 32, 65, 69,
     71, 73, 77, 79, 89, 93 and 95.
  6) This tag indicates the location and area of the main subject in the
     overall scene. Count can be 2 (a spot defined by two coordinates),
     3 (a circle defined by centre coordinates and diameter) and
     4 (a rectangle defined by its centre coordinates and its dimensions).
  7) The 'UserComment' tag must start with an 8 byte "ID code", which
     can be "ASCII\00\00\00", "JIS\00\00\00\00\00", "Unicode" or eight
     null bytes for "undefined". The ID code identifies the character
     code to be used in the following. A null terminator is not required.
  8) A sub-second-time tag value represents a fraction of a second, relative
     to the 'DateTime' tag and other such tags, as an ASCII null-terminated
     string made of numeric characters; an arbitrary number of spaces can
     be appended to the numeric characters string. If sub-second data is not
     known the tag value may contain only spaces. The corresponding regular
     expression is /\d*\s*\000/.
  9) This is the valid width or height of the meaningful image (horizontal
     dimension does not include data padding). Overall image dimensions can
     be read in the SOF segment (this includes padding however).
 10) This tag is used to record the name of an audio file related to the
     image data: an ASCII string consisting of 8 characters + '.' + 3
     characters, terminated by NULL. The path is not recorded.
     The corresponding regular expression is /\w{8}\.\w{3}\000/.
 11) This tag indicates the colour filter array (CFA) geometric pattern of
     the image sensor when a one-chip colour area sensor is used. The first
     four bytes must be interpreted as two shorts giving the horizontal (m)
     and vertical (n) repeat pixel units. Then, m x n bytes follow, giving
     the actual colour filter values (in the range 0-6).
 12) This tag indicates information on the picture-taking conditions of a
     particular camera model, for a reader. The first four bytes must be
     interpreted as two shorts giving the number of display rows and columns.
     The following bytes must be interpreted as Unicode (UCS-2) streams,
     NULL terminated and including the signature. The specifics of the
     Unicode string are as given in ISO/IEC 10464-1. An approximation to
     the corresponding regular expression is /.{4}(\376\377(.{2})*\000\000)*/.

The Adobe's Photoshop program, at least from version 7.0 on, seems to add
some non-standard tags to the Exif private tags subdirectory during the
treatment of raw camera pictures. The corresponding record values are all
ASCII strings ($ASCII type), and contain the description of the tags
themselves. The following might be an incomplete list:

    Hexadecimal code      count   value begins with (a null terminated
       |  Tag name     type |     string is to be added at the end):
       |  |               | |     |

    fe57  _Smoothness     A -     "Smoothness: "   
    fe58  _MoireFilter    A -     "Moire Filter: " 

=head2 Exif tags for the 0th IFD Interoperability subdirectory

If the main image is compressed (which is always the case for a JPEG
picture), the "Design rule for Camera File system"
L<recommendations|Image::MetaData::JPEG::Structures/Structure of an Exif
APP1 segment> suggest to add another IFD below SubIFD, the Interoperability
IFD, pointed to by the InteroperabilityOffset tag; legal tags are listed in
the following table. The first two columns show tag hexadecimal codes and
names. The 'type' column specifies the tag type: I (short or long), U
(undefined) and A (ASCII, always null terminated). The 'count' column
obviously specifies the value count ('-' means that it is variable). The
"Index" and "Version" tags are mandatory if the subIFD is present, and they
are automatically added by this module if necessary.

=head2 Exif tags for the 0th IFD GPS subdirectory

The following tags are used for GPS attributes in the GPS IFD, pointed to
(if present) by the GPSInfo tag in IFD0 or IFD1. This standard was already
used in TIFF/EP, and is now part of L<Exif
2.2|Image::MetaData::JPEG::Structures/Structure of an Exif APP1
segment>. The first two columns show tag hexadecimal codes and names. The
'type' column specifies the tag type: B (byte), S (short), R (rational), U
(undefined) and A (ASCII, always null terminated). The 'count' column
obviously specifies the value count ('-' means that it is variable). All
GPS tags are optional in a JPEG or TIFF file, but the 'VersionID' tag must
be present, if the GPS IFD is present (a default 'VersionID' = (2,2,0,0),
i.e. v.2.2, is automatically added by this module if necessary).

  Notes:
  1) A latitude or longitude reference specifies a sign for another
     (related) latitude or longitude value tag. A latitude reference can be
     only 'N' (for North) or 'S' (for South); a longitude reference can be
     only 'E' (for East) or 'W' (for West).
  2) A latitude or a longitude is stored as a sequence of three rational
     numbers (each rational number is the ratio of two unsigned long
     integers), representing degrees, minutes and seconds. A typical format
     is (dd/1, mm/1, ss/1). Sometimes, seconds are dropped in favour of
     fractions of minutes (usually with two decimal places); in this case
     the format is (dd/1, mmmm/100, 0/1). Latitudes are limited to the
     interval [0,90], while longitudes to [0,180].
  3) A "speed (distance) reference" is the unit for the speed (distance)
     value stored in another (related) tag. The only allowed values are 'K'
     (for Km/h or Km), 'M' (for miles/h or miles) or 'N' (knots). Let us
     appreciate the fact that knot in English is both a unit of speed (one
     nautical mile per hour) and of distance (one nautical mile).
  4) A direction reference specifies how to interpret a following direction
     value. Only two references are possible: 'T' (for the true direction)
     or 'M' (for the magnetic direction).
  5) A direction (of the pointed image, of the movement of the GPS
     receiver, ecc ...) is a decimal number specifying an angle. The
     allowed range is between 0.00 and 359.99.
  6) The processing method and the area information are character strings,
     whose first character specifies the character code used: this is the
     first character of the 8-byte character code identification in the
     'UserComment' tag in the SubIFD, so 'A' means ASCII, 'J' means JIS,
     'U' means Unicode and a null character means undefined. Since the type
     is not ASCII, null termination is not required.
  7) A date tag value is a null terminated string of the form "YYYY:MM:DD"
     (note the colon signs). [I currently allow only years after 1800].

=head2 IPTC data (Editorial information and envelope record)

The structure of an IPTC stream is introduced in section
L<Image::MetaData::JPEG::Structures/Structure of an IPTC data block>. This
section contains only the list of valid IPTC tags. Since the use of APP13
for IPTC information in a JPEG picture is not a real standard, it is not
clear which subset of IPTC should be considered valid; my current guess is
that only editorial IPTC datasets (2:xx) and, more rarely, some envelope
datasets (1:xx, which are however needed for non ASCII character sets) are
found. Numeric tag values (record keys), in the first column, are in
decimal notation, and they are followed by tag names in the second
column. The presence of 'N' in the third column means that the record is
non-repeatable (i.e., there should not be two such records in the
file). The following number or range in square brackets indicates valid
lengths for the record data field. The final comment specifies additional
format constraints, sometimes in natural language: "/regex/" means that the
string must match the regular expression regex; "invalid" means that this
valid IPTC tag is not used in JPEG pictures; other formats are specified in
the notes. Note that IPTC strings are stored in records with an explicit
length, so they do not need the final null character (they are not
C-strings).

  Notes:
  1) A "word" is made of elements of what the IPTC standard calls "graphic
     characters" set, i.e. all characters that have visual representation.
     Control codes, the space character and the DEL character are NOT
     graphic characters. Note that the visual representation of a graphic
     character depends upon the character set invoked at the time of
     evaluation. A "word" is matched by the following regular expression:
     /^[^\000-\040\177]*$/.
  2) A date is stored, in conformity to the ISO 8601 standard, as the eight
     character string 'CCYYMMDD', e.g., '19890317' indicates March 17th
     1989. A date string is matched by the following regular expression:
     /\d{4}(0\d|1[0-2])([0-2]\d|3[01])/. [Currently, I allow only years
     after 1800; but 'DateCreated' has no limitation since it refers to the
     creation date of the photographed object, not to the creation of the
     photo itself].
  3) A time is stored, in conformity to the ISO 8601 standard, as the
     eleven character string 'HHMMSS+/-HHMM', e.g., '090000-0500' indicates
     9AM, 5 hours behind the coordinated universal time. A time string is
     matched by the following regular expression:
     /([01]\d|2[0-3])[0-5]\d[0-5]\d[\+-]([01]\d|2[0-3])[0-5]\d/.
  4) This dataset selects a character set, for use in character oriented
     datasets in records 2-6, according to the "International Register of
     Coded Character Sets" (ISO/IEC 2022 and ISO/IEC 2375, see for instance
     L<http://www.itscj.ipsj.or.jp/ISO-IR/>), and typically consist of the
     escape control character followed by one or more graphic characters.
     For instance, "\033/A" refers to ISO-8859-1 (latin-1) and "\033%G" refers
     to UTF-8 (a Unicode encoding).
  5) A "line" is made of graphic characters (see note 1) and space. This is
     matched by the following regular expression: /^[^\000-\037\177]*$/.
  6) A "duration" is stored like a "time", but there is no time zone spec;
     this means that the string is only six characters wide (see also note 3).
  7) The complicated regular expression for the SubjectReference is the
     following: /[$validchar]{1,32}?:[01]\d{7}(:[$validchar\s]{0,64}?){3}/,
     where $validchar is '\040-\051\053-\071\073-\076\100-\176'.
