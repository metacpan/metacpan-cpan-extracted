          - "naked" fields (those no writer, default, or builder) that cannot

          - Use new version of B::Hooks::AtRuntime. Classes now remain
            immutable under the debugger. Thanks to haarg and Ben Morrow for
            following up on that.
          - Move perl critic deps to test dependencies and update
            dist.ini in the process. (thanks, waterkip!)

          - Reorganize docs to provide links to a manual
          - Make cloning much more flexible (thanks to Leon Timmermans for
