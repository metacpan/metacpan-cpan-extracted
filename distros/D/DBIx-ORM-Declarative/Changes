    - Fixed missing name in automagic columns created from unique declarations.

    - Removed perl 5.6 specific code.
    - Changed warning suppression code to use "local ($SIG{__WARN__})"
    - Added create_only method, which creates one or more rows without
      validating the input or returning row objects.
    - Added WHERE clause handling to the size method.

0.11  Fri Sep 15 14:26:33 2006
    - Fixed bug in WHERE clause handing in size() method.

0.12  Sun Nov  5 20:32:47 2006

    - Added subselect processing for 'IN'/'NOT IN' WHERE clauses.

0.14  Fri Jun  1 22:37:01 2007
    Good grief, what *didn't* change?  There's more than 1500 new lines!
    - Reorganized and annotated the code extensively
    - Added the beginnings of a real test suite
    - Added methods to handle creating lots of rows at once
    - Added classes and methods to better deal with joins; not perfect, but
      it's better than the earlier join objects.
    - Added Module::Build-based Build.PL file.  The Makefile.PL file is
      deprecated, and may be removed in the future.

0.15  Tue Jul  3 20:16:29 2007
    - Changed table/join creation to better support tables with column names
      that match the table name.

0.16  Wed Jul 25 21:29:55 2007
    - Fixed table aliases bug introduced with 0.15; aliases now update the
      table_methods hash
    - Added implicit subclassing - now, when you do this:

    package Foo;
    use DBIx::ORM::Declarative
    (
        {
            schema => 'fooschema',
            # The rest of the declaration...
        },
    ) ;

    you can just do this:

    my $db = new Foo handle => $dbh;

    and $db is a schema object.  Note that if you have multiple schemas,
    Foo will be added as a subclass to all of them.

0.17  Sat Aug 18 10:22:26 2007
    - Fixed schema class magic to work better with classes that provide
      an AUTOLOAD function

0.18  Mon Aug 20 18:57:21 2007
    - Added support for extensive joins; now you can do joins across sets of
      tables where no single table has references to all of the others.

0.19  Sat Sep  1 09:30:06 2007
    - Added functionality to automatically connect to a database.

0.20  Wed Sep  5 08:50:43 2007
    - Expanded bulk_create to account for all of the unique keys - not just the
      primary keys.

0.21  Wed Sep  5 09:17:07 2007
    - Fixed a couple of typos

0.22  Fri Mar  7 15:05:46 2008
    - Changed import logic to use $pkg->isa, rather than grovelling over
      @{$pkg . '::ISA'} directly.
