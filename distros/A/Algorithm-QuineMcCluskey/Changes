Revision history for Algorithm-QuineMcCluskey

0.18
    2018-07-10
	- Check for existence of next-level implicant before pushing it
	  on the list. Which means the next loop runs shorter, saving time.
	- Since we only consider Hamming distances of 1 when comparing
	  covers, it doesn't make sense to have a separate Hamming
	  distance function to find the sole difference position. Merged
	  the code of hdist() and diffpos() into new function hammingd1pos(),
	  which lets us skip the list-checking functions. Since this function
	  is embedded four loops deep, this also saves time.
	- Function remels() was checking item by item even in cases where
	  the list items to remove were the entire list. Streamlined that.
	- The Hamming distance change above meant pairwise() isn't needed
	  now, which was the cause of the version requirement change of
	  List::MoreUtils. Put the older version number back in the
	  requirement.
0.17
    2018-06-21
	- Require latest version (0.428) of List::MoreUtils, as there seems
	  to be a crash-worthy side-effect happening with its earlier version
	  and Perl 5.26, as reported by Slaven Rezic.
	- Upped the version req's of Tie::Cycle, namespace::autoclean, and
	  Module::Build while I was at it.
0.16
     2017-02-27
	- The test in 24-solve.t, "A problem with sixteen possible covers",
	  had typos in four of its covers, all involving the term that
	  should have been BC'D' (the D variable was missing its complement
	  symbol).

0.15
     2017-01-31
	- Stupidly didn't upgrade the version number in QuineMcCluskey.pm.
	- Fix tests in 24-solve.t and 27-solve.t that had a typo in their
	  solution sets.
0.14
     2017-01-19
	- Had set the weed-out-expensive-solutions cost at the start of
	  the loop at 2**width, wrongly thinking that that would be the
	  maximum cost. Found a couple cases where that's not true,
	  making solve() return them as "()". Put those cases in a new
	  test file 27-solve.t.
	- Changed the weeding-out code to use an actual cost from the
	  covers array for the starting value.
0.13
     2017-01-5
	- The special cases where all entries are covered (i.e., all 1s or
	  all 0s in the truth table) causes a cover of all dc characters,
	  which returns "()" for solve(). That's a little unhelpful, so
	  check for that and return either a "(1)" or "(0)".
0.12
     2016-10-8
	- In BUILD, limit 'vars' to the number of variables actually needed.
	- With that change, remove array slice of 'vars' in other parts of
	  the code.
	- Add an 'order_by' attribute (undocumented for now) for use in
	  to_boolean().
	- Removed an unnecessary loop in to_boolean().
	- Corrected the sorting in the get_covers() example.
	- Update comments and Smart Comments.

0.11
     2016-8-25
	- Add method all_solutions(). Update the POD concerning using
	  get_covers() to refer to all_solutions().
0.10
     2016-7-20
	- Check to see if the terms (minterms, maxterms, or
	  dont-cares) are larger than 'width' in bit size.
	  It's possible I made that mistake myself recently.
	- And although it's not an error, run the terms through
	  sort and uniq before converting to bitstrings. It
	  makes visual inspection of the debug output easier.
0.09
     2016-6-27
	- Found a case where don't-care terms with no covers
	  were nonetheless included with the prime implicants.
	  Fixed by changing a map{}-everything-will-work into
	  a loop with an if statement to check for that.
	- New test file 25-solve.t (Rock Paper Scissors) that
	  covers the above problem.
	- Streamlined the bit term functions, and added some
	  more 'smart' comments to show the bit terms.
	- Added a release_status key to the Build.PL hash.
0.08
     2016-4-21
	- Changed a "sum map" to a "scalar grep" in countels(),
	  and inlined the diffposes() code in hdist() and diffpos().
	  This let us eliminate the last cases of calling sum().
	- These changes, along with using the any() function from
	  List::MoreUtils instead of List::Util, mean that we don't
	  need to load List::Util anymore.
	- Edited Build.PL add 'provides' and 'add-to-cleanup' keys;
	  bumped the min version requirement of List::MoreUtils to 0.401;
	  Removed List::Util and bumped the dist version.
	- Module now at version 0.08.
0.07
     2015-8-14
	- List::MoreUtils wasn't in the list of required modules
	  in Build.PL. Added it.
	- The description of get_covers() in the documentation
	  wasn't enough. Extended the example.
	- Bump the version to 0.07.
0.06
     2015-8-1
	- The changes of 2015-5-30 mean that the check for an empty
	  array in row_dominance() isn't needed anymore.
	- Use a simple join() in uniqel() instead of Data::Dumper.
	- Remove Data::Dumper from 'requires' key in Build.PL.
	- Bumped Version everywhere to 0.06; up to CPAN.
0.05
     2015-7-29
	- Documented methods get_primes(), get_essentials(), and
	  get_covers().
	- Changed attribute essentials from HashRef to ArrayRef.
	  It makes get_essentials() a bit more useful.
	- Renamed tableform() function to chart().
	- Updated README to current status of the API.
	- Version 0.05 now, and up to CPAN.
0.04
     2015-6-13
	- The build-and-break-a-columnstring mechanism for making
	  complements and duals of the object was clear but involved
	  using extra memory, potentially a lot. Removed that and
	  use the get_complement() function of List::Compare::Functional
	  instead.
	- I hadn't listed namespace::autoclean in the dependency list
	  in Build.PL, and I am hearing about it from the testers.
	- Similarly, some testers have a List::Utils module that's older
	  than October 2013, when any() was introduced. Specified version
	  1.35 in Build.PL to be safe.
	- Bump everthing's version up to 0.04. Up to CPAN.
0.03
     2015-6-12
	- The minimum perl required was 5.10.1, but the module
	  was using the /r modifier on the tr// operator, which
	  doesn't appear until 5.14. Oops. Changed the string
	  assignment order in dual() and complement().
	- Version goes to 0.03, and up to CPAN.
0.02
     2015-6-11
	- Realized that the maskmatcher regex could be changed to
	  not require the don't-care character, which means it doesn't
	  need to be in the parameter list of maskmatcher(),
	  purge_elements(), or remels().
	- Renamed maskmatcher() maskedmatch(), because the grammar
	  was bugging me.
	- With that, Version 0.02 is ready for CPAN.
     2015-6-3
	- Util.pm now has an %EXPORT_TAGS.
	- Change the covers attribute to contain all of the minimal
	  covers, not just the one that happens to be in the zeroth
	  position in the covers array.
	- Change solve() to return a scalar.
	- With solve() now returning a scalar, change tests to look
	  for an answer in a set of possible answers (some terms sets
	  can be covered by more than one equation.)
     2015-5-30
	- Make remels() remove the hash key if the array ref is empty.
	- Change columns() to not auto-create empty keys.
     2015-4-18
	- Made the primes attribute "lazy", so that one can look
	  up prime implicants without going through the solving
	  process.
     2015-4-15
	- Replace row_dom() and col_dom() with row_dominance()
	  in Util.pm. When they were changed to returning keys
	  instead of deleting from the hash immediately, they
	  became essentially the same function, just called
	  with different parameters.
     2015-3-27
	- Changed row_dom() and col_dom() to return the rows/cols
	  to remove, instead of removing them inside.
	- Changed row_dom() and col_dom() from methods to functions,
	  and moved the code to Util.pm
     2015-3-6
	- Method find_essentials() is essentially a single-term search
	  through the hash of arrays. Changed it from a method to a
	  function and moved it to Util.pm.
	- Found an error in remels(), which was only removing one
	  matched array element instead of all matched elements.
     2015-1-26
	- Changed argument list to purge_essentials(). Had been
	  taking an esssentials hash, but since it was only using the
	  keys of the hash, we only need to pass those.
	- In purge_essentials() change the order of deletion. The
	  primes hash "rows" (hash entries) are removed first,
	  *before* going through the hash to look for the "column"
	  in the array ref. Shortens the search for the "column".
	- The argument list change lets me use purge_essentials()
	  later in recurse_solve(), replacing a remels()/delete
	  pair of lines.
	- Renamed purge_essentials() to purge_elements(), since
	  the above change means we're not just purging essentials
	  now.
     2015-1-18
	- Removed sortterms attribute -- always sort.
	- Simplified covers loop (helped by removing sortterms).
	- Moved a constant calculation of the %reduced hash out
	  a loop.
     2015-1-16
	- New function tableformat() (current name, at least) to show
	  primes hash in the table form used in textbook Quine-McCluskey
	  descriptions. Should help users understand what's going on,
	  and help in debugging too.
	- New module to contain tableforms() (and future functions),
	  named it Algorithm::QuineMcCluskey::Format.
	- Do-while using is_LequivalentR() was supposed to be comparing
	  hash keys, but a 'keys' had been left off on one side.
	  Fixing that saves at least one loop.
	- Avoid calling recurse_solve() if the reduced primes hash is
	  empty.
     2015-1-6
	- Added new object-creating methods dual() and complement().
	- Added tests for the new methods.
     2015-1-1
	- No default parameters for find_essentials(). The primes
	  hash must be passed in, while the binary-formatted terms
	  are collectd from the object.
	- Found spots in QM.pm and Util.pm where a "sum map {}"
	  construct can be replaced with "any {}", which has the
	  advantage of early break out of the loop on a match.
     2014-12-3
	- The weight count in find_primes() and the cost count in
	  recursive_solve() were using sum of a map block using
	  split. A match in list context is much simpler, changed
	  them to that (and put the function for it in Util.pm).
     2014-11-27
	- Add \Q and \E around don't-care character in maskmatcher()
	  substitution code in case someone chose a substitution
	  metacharacter as their don't-care character.
     2014-11-26
	- Was looping around remel() for each arrayref in the hash.
	  Now just pass the hash in directly (this necessitated
	  changing one of the outer loops in purge_essentials,
	  and remel() becomes remels()).
     2014-11-13
	- The test with don't-care terms randomly fails two thirds
	  of the time. Separate it into its own file, and add
	  debugging statements.

     2014-11-4
	- Extended the object test to consider minterms, maxterms,
	  and columnstrings methods of creation.
	- deAlias considered finished and merged into the master
	  branch.
     2014-10-31
	- Added columnstring attribute, and wrote bitstring code
	  for setting and getting it.
	- Changed minterms, maxterms, and dontcares back to
	  'rw', allowing the columnstring attribute to set them.
     2014-10-28
	- Changed to_boolean() to take an argument list instead of
	  automatically using the covers attribute internally. This
	  will allow the user (or the test files) to check terms before
	  or during minimization.
	- Separated out the var-by-var code from to_boolean(). Now it
	  calls a new method to_boolean_term() for each individual term
	  in the covers (or other) list, for easier output manipulation.
     2014-09-28
	- The 'covers' attribute gets changed from ArrayRef[Int] to
	  ArrayRef[Str].
     2014-09-21
	- Added namespace::autoclean as recommended in the Moose Best
	  Practices manual.
	- Changed the all the "terms" attributes to 'ro'.
     2014-09-19
	- For internal clarity, renamed allterms() to all_bit_terms(),
	  and minmax_terms() to minmax_bit_terms().
	- Methods maskmatch() and maskmatches() now combined into a single
	  method (one called the other, but there was no reason for the
	  separate internal function, and it saved re-creating
	  utility variables over and over).
	- Check if there's an overlap between the don't-care list and
	  the min or max term list, and call it an error if there is.
	- Attributes actually check their type now (thanks Moose) so
	  the qw operators around the term lists are now removed in
	  the documentation and in the test files.
     2014-08-20
	- No more default arguments (in the form of $self->get_primes())
	  for row_dom(), col_dom(), and purge_essentials(). Always
	  pass in the argument -- it's less confusing that way.
	- Trim Util.pm of tobits() -- it's embedded in BUILD now.
     2014-08-19
	- More work in find_primes(). An array slice in a hash isn't
	  working as originally coded (I seem to recall the rules
	  changing some time ago). Changed it to two statements for
	  now.
     2014-07-07
	- After looking over the labeling in the run.t file, added
	  a new attribute, "title". We can now say what the A::QMcC
	  object actually represents.
	- Broke up run.t into separate test files. The original
	  file was compact and in theory easy to add to, but I was
	  having trouble figuring out what was causing my Moose
	  errors. Plus, there were too many eval calls in the code.
	- The original code changed the minterms, maxterms, and
	  dontcares attributes from the passed-in list of decimal
	  into bitstrings, and saved them back in the attributes.
	  We can't do that now, because Moose has set those fields
	  typed as 'ArrarRef[Int]'.
	  So, set up three new fields that represent the three fields
	  in their bitstring form: min_bits, max_bits, and dc_bits.
     2014-04-30
	- Moosified ("has" declarations) the attributes.
	- Achieved a compile-error-free version using Moose instead
	  of Alias. Now to make it runtime-error-free.
	- As part of the compilation process, moved from a Makefile.PL
	  base (which was creating errors of its own) to Build.PL,
	  which Just Works.
	- Turned attributes boolean, imp, and bits into a local
	  variables as they were only used in single functions.
	- Defined and made use of predicate functions for attributes
	  minterms, maxterms, and dontcares. Simplifies some sanity
	  checks.
	- Added methods allterms() and minmax_terms() to simplify
	  coding.
	- List::MoreUtils isn't actually being used in A::QMcC (it is
	  used in A::QMcC::Util though).
