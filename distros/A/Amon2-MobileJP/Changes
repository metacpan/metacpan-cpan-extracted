Revision history for Perl extension Amon2::Plugin::Web::MobileAgent

0.11 2013-10-08T23:40:47Z

    - I retired to maintain flavors for Japanese mobile phones.
      We will not create any sites for Japanese mobile phones!
      But, if you want to maintain this module, I can pass the maintainership.
