=head1 NAME

ful - a useI<B<ful>> pragma that will ascend dirs to automatically
"B<f>ind B<u>pper B<l>ib" directories and add them to C<@INC>.


=head1 NOTICE

If you felt your blood boil when you first discovered this module, don't worry,
you're not alone.

This module name not only effectively breaks all of the "rules," but is also
non-descript, duplicates existing functionality, and is purely a vanity project.

(Maybe you should C<use common::sense;>)

=head1 SYNOPSIS

One line to rule them all.

    use ful;

Within C<a-script.pl> when your project looks like this:

    project-root/
    ├── bin/
    │   └── utils/
    │       └── a-script.pl
    ├── lib/
    ├── vendor/
    │   └── SomeOrg/
    │       └── Some/
    │           └── Module.pm

If you need more than just the C<project-root/lib> directory, you can do this:

    use ful qw/vendor lib/;

Instead of:

    use lib::relative '../../lib';
    use lib::relative '../../vendor';
    # or
    use FindBin;
    use lib "$FindBin::Bin/../lib";
    use lib "$FindBin::Bin/../vendor";
    # or even
    BEGIN {
        use Path::Tiny;
        my $base = path(__FILE__)->parent;
        $base = $base->parent until -d "$base/lib" or $base->is_rootdir;
        unshift @INC, "$base/lib", "$base/vendor";
    }
