NAME
    "IO::Async::Loop::linux" - pick the best Loop implementation on Linux

DESCRIPTION
    If this module is installed, then the best Loop implementation will
    automatically be picked when "IO::Async::Loop->new()" is called on a
    Linux machine. It will attempt to use either of the following, in order,
    if they are available

    *   IO::Async::Loop::Epoll

    *   IO::Async::Loop::Ppoll

    The end application using IO::Async does not need to make any special
    effort to use these; the magic constructor in IO::Async::Loop will
    automatically find and use it if it is installed.

     $ perl -MIO::Async::Loop -E 'say ref IO::Async::Loop->new'
     IO::Async::Loop::Epoll
