name: platelet-derived growth factor complex
namespace: cellular_component
def: "A protein complex consisting of two chains of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) subunits. PDGF dimers bind to PDGF receptors in the plasma membrane and induce receptor dimerisation and activation. PDGFs are involved in a wide variety of signalling processes. PDGFs are found in all vertebrates where at least 2 different chains (A and B) exist. In human (and other mammals), four types of PDGF chains (A, B, C, and D) are known which form five different dimers (AA, AB, BB, CC and DD)."

comment: An example of this is PDGFA in human (P04085) in PMID:20534510 (inferred from direct assay).

comment: Location as a relation between instances: The primitive instance-level relation c located_in r at t reflects the fact that each continuant is at any given time associated with exactly one spatial region, namely its exact location. Following we can use this relation to define a further instance-level location relation - not between a continuant and the region which it exactly occupies, but rather between one continuant and another. c is located in c1, in this sense, whenever the spatial region occupied by c is part_of the spatial region occupied by c1.    Note that this relation comprehends both the relation of exact location between one continuant and another which obtains when r and r1 are identical (for example, when a portion of fluid exactly fills a cavity), as well as those sorts of inexact location relations which obtain, for example, between brain and head or between ovum and uterus
