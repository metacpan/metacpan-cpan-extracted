Revision history for Perl extension Tk::StyleDialog.

  0.04  Sep 24 2008
  - Fixed Makefile.PL to name Tk and Tk::PNG as dependencies (to stop being
    nagged by CPAN test failures :P)

  0.03  Sep 19 2008
  - Fixed a bug with "-grab => global" not working properly.

  0.02  Sep 19 2008
  - Added a binding so that the space bar invokes the default button in addition
    to just the return key.
  - Added an option of `-center => 0` to stop the default behavior of centering
    the dialog box on-screen.
  - Fixed the Makefile so it doesn't require Perl 5.10 :)

  0.01  Sep 18 2008
  - Initial release.
