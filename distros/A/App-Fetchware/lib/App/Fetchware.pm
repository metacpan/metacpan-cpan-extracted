# _make_config_sub() is an internal subroutine that only App::Fetchware and

# subroutines that you want your fetchware extensions to have.
#=head2 _make_config_sub()
#
#    _make_config_sub($name, $one_or_many_values)
#
#A function factory that builds many functions that are the exact same, but have
#different names. It supports three types of functions determined by
#_make_config_sub()'s second parameter.  It's first parameter is the name of that
#function. This is the subroutine that builds all of Fetchwarefile's
#configuration subroutines such as lookupurl, mirror, fetchware, etc....
#
#=over
#=item LIMITATION
#
#_make_config_sub() creates subroutines that have prototypes, but in order for
#perl to honor those prototypes perl B<must> know about them at compile-time;
#therefore, that is why _make_config_sub() must be called inside a C<BEGIN> block.
#
#=back
#
#=over
#=item NOTE
#_make_config_sub() uses caller to determine the package that _make_config_sub()
#was called from. This package is then prepended to the string that is eval'd to
#create the designated subroutine in the caller's package. This is needed so that
#App::Fetchware "subclasses" can import this function, and enjoy its simple
#interface to create custom configuration subroutines.
#
#=back
#
#=over
#
#=item $one_or_many_values Supported Values
#
#=over
#
#=item * 'ONE'
#
#Generates a function with the name of _make_config_sub()'s first parameter that
#can B<only> be called one time per Fetchwarefile. If called more than one time
#will die with an error message.
#
#Function created with C<$CONFIG{$name} = $value;> inside the generated function that
#is named $name.
#
#=item * 'ONEARRREF'
#
#Generates a function with the name of _make_config_sub()'s first parameter that
#can B<only> be called one time per Fetchwarefile. And just like C<'ONE'> above
#if called more than once it will throw an exception. However, C<'ONEARRREF'> can
#be called with a list of values just like C<'MANY'> can, but it can still only
#be called once like C<'ONE'>.
#
#=item * 'MANY'
#
#Generates a function with the name of _make_config_sub()'s first parameter that
#can be called more than just once. This option is only used by fetchware's
#C<mirror()> API call.
#
#Function created with C<push @{$CONFIG{$name}}, $value;> inside the generated function that
#is named $name.
#
#=item * 'BOOLEAN'
#
#Generates a function with the name of _make_config_sub()'s first parameter that
#can be called only once just like 'ONE' can be, but it also only support true or
#false values.  What is true and false is the same as in perl, with the exception
#that /false/i and /off/i are also false.
#
#Function created the same way as 'ONE''s are, but with /false/i and /off/i
#mutated into a Perl accepted false value (they're turned into zeros.).

            program => <<EOA,
program simply names the program the Fetchwarefile is responsible for
downloading, building, and installing.
EOA
            filter => <<EOA,
filter specifies a program name and/or version number that tells fetchware
which program and or which version of a program you want fetchware to install.
This is *only* needed in cases where there are multiple programs and or
multiple versions of the same program in the directory lookup_url specifies.
EOA
            temp_dir => <<EOA,
temp_dir specifies what temporary directory fetchware will use to download and
build this program.
EOA
            user => <<EOA,
user specifes a user that fetchware will drop priviledges to when fetchware
downloads and builds your software. It will then switch back to root privs, if
run as root, and install your software system wide. This does not work on
Windows.
EOA
            fetchware_database_path => <<EOA,
fetchware_database_path specifies an alternate path for fetchware to use to
store the fetchware package that 'fetchware install' creates, and that
'fetchware upgrade' uses to upgrade this fetchware package.
EOA
            prefix => <<EOA,
prefix specifies what base path your software will be installed under. This
only works for software that uses GNU AutoTools to configure itself, it uses
./configure.
EOA
            configure_options => <<EOA,
configure_options specifes what options fetchware should pass to ./configure
when it configures your software. This option only works for software that
uses GNU AutoTools.
EOA
            make_options => <<EOA,
make_options specifes what options fetchware should pass to make when make is
run to build and install your software.
EOA
            build_commands => <<EOA,
build_commands specifies what commands fetchware should execute to build your
software.
EOA
            install_commands => <<EOA,
install_commands specifies what commands fetchware should execute to install
your software.
EOA
            uninstall_commands => <<EOA,
uninstall_commands specifies what commands fetchware should execute to uninstall
your software.
EOA
            lookup_url => <<EOA,
lookup_url specifes the url that fetchware uses to determine what what
versions of your program are available. It should point to a directory listing
instead of a specific file.
EOA
            lookup_method => <<EOA,
lookup_method specifies how fetchware determines what version of your program
to install. The default is the 'timestamp' algorithm, and then to try the
'versionstring' algorithm if 'timestamp' fails. lookup_method specifies which
one you would like to use. Only the strings 'timestamp' and 'versionstring'
are allowed options.
EOA
            gpg_keys_url => <<EOA,
gpg_keys_url specifies the url that fetchware will use to download the author's
KEYS file that it uses for gpg verification.
EOA
            gpg_sig_url => <<EOA,
gpg_sig_url specifies the url that fetchware uses to download digital
signatures of this program. They're files that usually end .asc.
EOA
            sha1_url => <<EOA,
sha1_url specfies the url that fetchware uses to download sha1sum files of
this program. This url should be the program's main download site instead of a
mirror, because a hacked mirror could alter the sha1sum on that mirror.
EOA
            md5_url => <<EOA,
md5_url specfies the url that fetchware uses to download md5sum files of
this program. This url should be the program's main download site instead of a
mirror, because a hacked mirror could alter the md5sum on that mirror.
EOA
            verify_method => <<EOA,
verify_method specifes a specific method that fetchware should use to verify
your program. This method can be 'gpg', 'sha1', or 'md5'.
EOA
            no_install => <<EOA,
no_install specifies that this software should not be installed. Instead, the
install step is skipped, and fetchware prints to STDOUT where it downloaded,
verified, and built your program. no_install must be a true or false value.
EOA
            verify_failure_ok => <<EOA,
verify_failure_ok specifies that fetchware should not stop installing your
software and terminate with an error message if fetchware fails to verify your
software. You should never set this to true. Doing so could cause fetchware to
install software that may have been compromised, or had malware inserted into
it. Never use this option unless the author or maintainer of this program does
not gpg sign or checksum his software.
EOA
            user_keyring => <<EOA,
users_keyring if enabled causes fetchware to use the user's own gpg keyring
instead of fetchware's own keyring.
EOA
            mirror => <<EOA
The mirror configuration option provides fetchware with alternate servers to
try to download this program from. This option is used when the server
specified in the url options in this file is unavailable or times out.
EOA

Fetchware's new command is reasonably sophisticated, and is smart enough to
determine based on the lookup_url you provide if it can autogenerate a
Fetchwarefile for you. If Fetchware cannot, then it will ask you more
questions regarding the information it requires to be able to build a
installable fetchware package for you. After that, fetchware will ask you if
you would like to edit the Fetchwarefile, fetchware has created for you in an
editor. If you say yes, fetchware will open a editor for you, but if you say
no, fetchware will skip the custom editing. Next, fetchware will create a test
Fetchwarefile for you, and ask you if you would like to test it by trying to
install it now. If you say yes, fetchware will install it, and if you say no,
then fetchware will print the location of the Fetchwarefile it created for
you to later use to install your application.

Fetchware's heart and soul is its lookup_url. This is the configuration option
that tells fetchware where to check what the latest version of your program is.
This version number is then parsed out of the HTTP/FTP/local directory listing,
and compared against the latest installed version to determine when a new
version of your program has been released.

How to determine your application's lookup_url:
    1. Go to your application's Web site.
    2. Determine the download link for the latest version and copy it with
       CTRL-C or right-click it and select "copy".
    3. Paste the download link into your browser's URL Location Bar.
    4. Delete the filename from the location by starting at the end and deleting
       everything to the left until you reach a slash '/'.
       * ftp://a.url/downloads/program.tar.gz -> ftp://a.url/downloads/
    5. Press enter to access the directory listing on your Application's mirror
       site.
    6. If the directory listing in either FTP or HTTP format is displayed in
       your browser, then Fetchware's default, built-in lookup fuctionality will
       probably work properly. Copy and paste this URL into the prompt below, and
       Fetchware will download and analyze your lookup_url to see if it will work
       properly. If you do not end up with a browser directory listing, then
       please see Fetchware's documentation using perldoc App::Fetchware.

EOS
        my $what_a_filter_is = <<EOA;
Fetchware needs you to provide a filter option, which is a pattern that fetchware
compares each file in the directory listing of your lookup_url to to determine
which version of your program to install.

Directories will have other junk files in them or even completely different
programs that could confuse fetchware, and even potentially cause it to install
a different program. Therefore, you should also add the program name to the
begining of your filter. For example if you program is apache, then your filter
should include the name of apache on mirror sites, which is actually:
httpd

For example, Apache's lookup_url has three versions in the same lookup_url
directory listing. These are 2.4, 2.2, and 2.0. Without the filter option
fetchware would choose the highest, which would be 2.4, which is the latest
version. However, you may want to stick with the older and perhaps more stable
2.2 version of apache. Therefore, you'll need to tell fetchware this by using
by adding the version number to your filter:
httpd-2.2
will result in fetchware filtering the results of its lookup check through your
filter of httpd-2.2 causing fetchware to choose the latest version from the 2.2
stable branch instead of the higher version numbered 2.4 or 2.0 legacy releases.
Note the use of the dash, which is used in the filename to separate the 'httpd'
name part from the '2.2' version part.

Note: fetchware accepts any valid perl regular expresion as an acceptable
filter option, but that should only be needed for advanced users. See perldoc
fetchware.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    ### App::Fetchware's use inside a Fetchwarefile.
    ### See fetchware's new command for an easy way to create Fetchwarefiles.
    use App::Fetchware;

    # Only program, lookup_url, one or more mirrors, and some method of

=head1 DESCRIPTION

App::Fetchware represents fetchware's API. For ducumentation on how to use
App::Fetchware's fetchware command line interface see L<fetchware>.

It is the heart and soul of fetchware where all of fetchware's main behaviors
are kept. It is fetchware's API, which consists of the subroutines new(),
new_install(), check_syntax(), start(), lookup(), download(), verify(),
unarchive(), build(), install(), uninstall(), upgrade() and end().

App::Fetchware stores both details about C<fetchware>'s configuration file
syntax, documents how to create a fetchware extension, and documents the
internal workings of how App::Fetchware implements C<fetchware>'s package
management behavior:

=over

=item *

For details on App::Fetchware's configuration file syntax see the section L<CREATING A App::Fetchware FETCHWAREFILE> and the section L<MANUALLY CREATING A App::Fetchware FETCHWAREFILE> for more details, and how to create one in a text editor without C<fetchware new>'s help.

=item *

If the needs of your program overcome the capabilities of App::Fetchware's configuration options, then see the section
L<FURTHER CUSTOMIZTING YOUR FETCHWAREFILE> for details on how to overcome those
limitations.

=item *

Straightforward and more complicated Fetchware file examples are available in
the L<EXAMPLE FETCHWAREFILES> section.

=item * 

For instructions on how to create a fetchware extension see the section
L<CREATING A FETCHWARE EXTENSION>.

For details on App::Fetchware's API that is useful for those customizing their
Fetchwarefile's and to those who are implementing a fetchware extension please
see the section L<FETCHWAREFILE API SUBROUTINES>.

=head1 CREATING A App::Fetchware FETCHWAREFILE

In order to create a new fetchware package, you need to create a new
Fetchwarefile. You can easily do this with the C<fetchware new> command, which
works as follows.

=over

=item 1. This command will ask you a few questions, and use the answers you provide to create a Fetchwarefile for you.

=item 2. After it does so, it gives you a chance to edit its autogenerated Fetchwarefile manually in an editor of your choice.

=item 3. Afterwards, it will ask you if you would like to go ahead and use your newly created Fetchwarefile to install your new program as a fetchware package.  If you answer yes, the default, it will install it, but if you anwer no; instead, it will simply print out the location to the Fetchwarefile that it created for you. You can then copy that file to a location of your choice, or use that path as an option to additional fetchware commands.

=back

You can also create your Fetchwarefile manually in a text editor if you want to.
See the section L</MANUALLY CREATING A App::Fetchware FETCHWAREFILE> for the
details. Some programs require greater customization of Fetchware's behavior
than is available in its configuration options in these cases see the section
L</FURTHER CUSTOMIZTING YOUR FETCHWAREFILE> for the specific details on how to
make fetchware do what it needs to do to manage your source code distributions.

=head1 MANUALLY CREATING A App::Fetchware FETCHWAREFILE

L<fetchware> provides a L<new|fetchware/new> command that allows you to easily
create a Fetchwarefile by simply answering a bunch of simple questions. This
C<new> command even will let you manually edit the Fetchwarefile it generates
for you, so you can later customize it however you want to. Then it will ask if
you want to install it. If you answer yes, then it will install it for you, if
you answer no, it will print out the path to the newly created Fetchwarefile it
created for you. Then you can call C<fetchware install path/to/Fetchwarefile> to
install it later on. Or you can follow the instructions below and manually
create a Fetchwarefile in your text editor of choice.

=head2 Fetchware's Fetchwarefile's configuration option syntax

The syntax for setting configuration options is easy. It's just the name of the
configuration option you want to specify like so:

    program

And then you add a space, and then whatever value you want it to have in quotes.

    program 'Apache';

And don't forget the semicolon C<;> on then end. The semicolon is required

You can use comments as needed to help document you Fetchwarefile like so:

    # Fetchwarefile for Apache.
    program 'Apache';

=over

=item B<1. Name it>

Use your text editor to create a file with a C<.Fetchwarefile> file extension.
Use of this convention is not required, but it makes it obvious what type of
file it is. Then, just copy and paste the example text below, and replace
C<[program]> with what you choose the name of your proram to be.
C<program> is simply a configuration option that simply names your
Fetchwarefile. It is not actually used for anything other than to name your
Fetchwarefile to document what program or behavior this Fetchwarefile manages.

    use App::Fetchware;

    # [program] - explain what [program] does.
    program '[program]';

Fetchwarefiles are actually small, well structured, Perl programs that can
contain arbitrary perl code to customize fetchware's behavior, or, in most
cases, simply specify a number of fetchware or a fetchware extension's
configuration options. Below is my filled in example App::Fetchware
fetchwarefile.

    use App::Fetchware;

    # apache 2.2 - Web Server.
    program 'apache-2.2';

Notice the C<use App::Fetchware;> line at the top. That line is
absolutely critical for this Fetchwarefile to work properly, because it is what
allows fetchware to use Perl's own syntax as a nice easy to use syntax for
Fetchwarefiles. If you do not use the matching C<use App::Fetchware;> line,
then fetchware will spit out crazy errors from Perl's own compiler listing all
of the syntax errors you have. If you ever receive that error, just ensure you
have the correct C<use App::Fetchware;> line at the top of your
Fetchwarefile.

=item B<2. Determine your lookup_url>

At the heart of App::Fetchware is its C<lookup_url>, which is
the URL to the FTP or HTTP mirror you want App::Fetchware to use to obtain a
directory listing to see if a new version of your program is available for
download. To figure this out just use your browser to find the program you
want fetchware to manage for you's Web site. Skip over the download link, and
instead look for the gpg, sha1, or md5 verify links, and copy and paste one of
those between the single quotes above in the lookup_url. Then delete the file
portion--from right to left until you reach a C</>. This is necessary, because
fetchware uses the lookup_url as a basis to download your the gpg, sha1, or md5
digital signatures or checksums to ensure that the packages fetchware downloads
and installs are exactly the same as the ones the author uploads.

    lookup_url '';

And then after you copy the url.

    lookup_url 'http://www.apache.org/dist/httpd/';

=item B<3. Determine your filter configuration option>

The C<filter> option specifies a L<perl regex|perlretut> that is matched against
the list of the files in the directory you specify in your C<lookup_url>. This
sorts through the directory to pick out which program or even which version of
the same program you want this Fetchwarefile to manage.

This is needed, because some programs such as L<Apache|http://httpd.apache.org>
have multiple versions available at the same time, so you would need to specify
which version of apache you want to download. So, you'd specify
C<filter 'httpd-2.2';> to make fetchware download and manage Apache 2.2, or you
could specify C<filter 'httpd-2.4';> to specify the newer 2.4 series version.

This option also exists to allow fetchware to pick out our program if you
specify a mirror directory that has more than one program in it. If you do this,
then fetchware can use C<filter> to pick out the program you want to download
and install from the crowd.

Just write your perl regex in between the single quotes C<'> below. You don't
need to master regular expressions to specify this option. Just specify the name
of the program and/or the main part of the version number. B<Do not> specify the
entire version number or fetchware will never update your program properly.

    filter '';

And then after you type in the text pattern.

    filter 'httpd-2.2';

=item B<4. Add mandatory verification settings>

Verification of software downloads is mandatory, because fetchware, in order to
install the software that is downloaded, must execute the build and installation
scripts on your computer sometimes even as the root administrator! Therefore,
fetchware will refuse to build and install any software package that cannot be
verified. This limitation can be bypassed by setting the C<verify_failure_ok>
configuration option to true, but this is B<not> recommended.

Instead, if standard verification fails, please set up one or more of the
configuration options below that may allow verification to succeed if the author
has his download site set up differently then fetchware expects.

=over

=item gpg_keys_url - Should list a URL to a file most likely named C<KEYS> that
contains versions of the author's gpg verification keys that is suitable to be
imported into gpg using C<gpg --import [name of file]>. An example would be:

    gpg_keys_url 'http://www.apache.org/dist/httpd/KEYS';

=item users_keyring - Tells fetchware to use the user who calls fetchware's gpg
keyring instead of fetchware's own keyring. This is handy for when you want to
install a program, but the author has no easily accessible C<KEYS> file, but the
author has listed his gpg key on his Website. With this option, you can import
this key into your own keyring using C<gpg --import [name of file]>, and then
specify this option in your Fetchwarefile as shown below.

    users_keyring 'On';

=item gpg_sig_url - Should list a URL to a directory (not a file) that has files
with the same names as the software archives that contain your program, but with
a C<.asc>, C<.sig>, or C<.sign> file extension. An example would be:

    gpg_sig_url 'http://www.apache.org/dist/httpd/';

=item sha1_url - Should list a URL to a directory (not a file) that has files
with the same names as the software archives that contain your program, but with
a C<.sha> or C<.sha1> file extension. An example would be:

    sha1_url 'http://www.apache.org/dist/httpd/';

=item md5_url - Should list a URL to a directory (not a file) that has files
with the same names as the software archives that contain your program, but with
a C<.md5> file extension. An example would be:

    md5_url 'http://www.apache.org/dist/httpd/';

=item NOTICE: There is no configuration option to change what filename fetchware
uses. You're stuck with its default of what fetchware determines your
$download_path to be with the appropriate C<.asc>, C<sha1>, or C<.md5> added
to it.  

=back

Just copy and paste the example above replacing the example between the single
quotes C<'> with the actual value you need.

=item B<5. Specify at least one mirror>

Because fetchware's C<lookup_url> B<must> be the author's main mirror instead of
a 3rd party mirror for verification purposes, you must also add a mirror option
that specifies one 3rd party mirror. I recommend picking one near your physical
geographical location or at least in your own country or one close by.

C<mirror> can be specified more than once, you you can have more than one
mirror. An example is below.

    mirror 'http://apache.mesi.com.ar//httpd/';
    mirror 'http://apache.osuosl.org//httpd/';
    mirror 'ftp://apache.mirrors.pair.com//httpd/';
    mirror 'http://mirrors.sonic.net/apache//httpd/';
    mirror 'http://apache.mirrors.lucidnetworks.net//';

You can specify as many mirrors as you want to. You could perhaps include all
the mirrors your source code distribution has. And the mirrors are tried in the
order they are specified in your Fetchwarefile.

=item B<6. Specifiy other options>

That's all there is to it unless you need to further customize App::Fetchware's
behavior to modify how your program is installed.

If your Fetchwarefile is now finished, you can install your new Fetchwarefile
as a fetchware package with:

    fetchware install [path to your new fetchwarefile]

Or you can futher customize it further as shown next if needed.

=item B<7. Optionally add build and install settings>

If you want to specify additional settings the first to choose from are the
build and install settings. These settings control how fetchware builds and
installs your software. They are briefly listed below. For further details see
the section L<App::Fetchware FETCHWAREFILE CONFIGURATION OPTIONS>.

=over

=item B<temp_dir> - Specifies the temporary directory fetchware will use to create its own working temporary directory where it downloads, unarchives, builds, and then installs your program from a directory inside this directory.

=item B<user> - (UNIX only) - Specifies a non-root user to drop privileges to when downloading, verifying, unarchive, and building your program. Root priveedges are kept in the parent process for install if needed.

=item B<prefix> - Specifies the --prefix option for AutoTools (./configure) based programs.

=item B<configure_options> - Specifies any additional options that fetchware should give to AutoTools when it runs ./configure to configure your program before it is built and installed.

=item B<make_options> - Specifies any command line options you would like to provide to make when make is run to build and install your software. C<-j 4> is quite popular to do a paralled make to build and install the program faster.

=item B<build_commands> - Specifies a list of commands that fetchware will use to build your program. You only need this option if your program uses a build system other than AutoTools such as C<cmake> or perhaps a custom one like Perl's C<Configure>

=item B<install_commands> - Specifies a list of commands that fetchware will use to install your program. You only need this option if your program uses a build system other than AutoTools such as C<cmake> or perhaps a custom one like Perl's C<Configure>

=item B<uninstall_commands> - Specifies a list of commands that fetchware will
use to I<uninstall> your program. You only need this option if your source code
distribution does not provide a C<make uninstall> target, which not every source
code distribution does.

=item B<no_install> - Specifies a boolean (true or false) value to turn off fetchware installing the software it has downloaded, verified, unarchvied, and built. If you specify a true argument (1 or 'True' or 'On'), then fetchware will C<not> install your program; instead, it will leave its temporary directory intact, and print out the path of this directory for you to inspect and install yourself. If you don't specify this argument, comment it out, or provide a false argument (0 or 'False' or 'Off'), then fetchware C<will> install your program.

=back

Just copy and paste the example below replacing C<[new_directive]> with the name
of the new directive you would like to add, and fill in the space between the
single quotes C<'>.

    [new_directive] '';

After pasting it should look like.

    [new_directive] '~/wallpapers';

=back

=head1 USING YOUR App::Fetchware FETCHWAREFILE WITH FETCHWARE

After you have
L<created your Fetchwarefile|/"MANUALLY CREATING A App::Fetchware FETCHWAREFILE">
as shown above you need to actually use the fetchware command line program to
install, upgrade, or uninstall your App::Fetchware Fetchwarefile.

=over

=item B<install>

A C<fetchware install [path/to/Fetchwarefile]> while using a App::Fetchware
Fetchwarefile causes fetchware to install the program specified in your
fetchwarefile to your computer as you have specified any build or install
options.

=item B<upgrade>

A C<fetchware upgrade [installed program name]> while using a App::Fetchware
Fetchwarefile will simply run the same thing as install all over again, which 
ill upgrade your program if a new version is available.

=item B<uninstall>

A C<fetchware uninstall [installed program name]> will cause fetchware to run
the command C<make uninstall>, or run the commands specified by the
C<uninstall_commands> configuration option. C<make uninstall> is only available
from some programs that use AutoTools such as ctags, but apache, for example,
also uses AutoTools, but does not provide a uninstall make target. Apache for
example, therefore, cannot be uninstalled by fetchware automatically.

=item B<upgrade-all>

A C<fetchware upgrade-all> will cause fetchware to run C<fetchware upgrade> for
all installed packages that fetchware is tracking in its internal fetchware
database. This command can be used to have fetchware upgrade all currently
installed programs that fetchware installed.

If you would like C<fetchware upgrade-all> to be run every night automatically
by cron, then just create a file say fetchware with the contents below in it,
and add it to /etc/cron.daily.

    #!/bin/sh
    # Update all already installed fetchware packages.
    fetchware upgrade-all

And if you don't want to run it system wide as root, you can add it to your user
crontab by pasting the snippet below in to your crontab by executing C<crontab -e>.

    # Check for updates using fetchware every night at 2:30AM.
    # Minute   Hour   Day of Month     Month          Day of Week     Command    
    # (0-59)  (0-23)     (1-31)  (1-12 or Jan-Dec) (0-6 or Sun-Sat)
        30      2          *              *               *           fetchware upgrade-all

=back

=head1 App::Fetchware'S FETCHWAREFILE CONFIGURATION OPTIONS

App::Fetchware has many configuration options. Most were briefly described in
the section L<MANUALLY CREATING A App::Fetchware FETCHWAREFILE>. All of them are
detailed below.

=head2 program 'Program Name';

C<program> simply gives this Fetchwarefile a name. It is availabe to fetchware
after parsing your Fetchwarefile, and is used to name your Fetchwarefile when
using C<fetchware new>. It is required just like C<lookup_url>, C<mirror>,
perhaps C<filter>, and some method to verify downloads are.

=head2 filter 'perl regex here';

Specifies a Perl regular expression that fetchware uses when it determines what
the latest version of a program is. It simply compares each file in the
directory listing specified in your C<lookup_url> to this regular expression,
and only matching files are allowed to pass through to the next part of
fetchware that looks for source code archives to download.

See L<perlretut> for details on how to use and create Perl regular expressions;
however, actual regex know how is not really needed just paste verbatim text
between the single quotes C<'>. For example, C<filter 'httpd-2.2';> will cause
fetchware to only download Apache 2.2 instead of the version for Windows or
whatever is in the weird httpd-deps-* package.

=head2 temp_dir '/tmp';

C<temp_dir> tells fetchware where to store fetchware's temporary working
directory that it uses to download, verify, unarchive, build, and install your
software. By default it uses your system temp directory, which is whatever
directory L<File::Temp's> tempdir() decides to use, which is whatever
L<File::Spec>'s tmpdir() decides to use.

=head2 fetchware_db_path '~/.fetchwaredb';

C<fetchware_db_path> tells fetchware to use a different directory other
than its default directory to store the installed fetchware package for the
particular fetchware package that this option is specified in your
Fetchwarefile. Fetchware's default is C</var/log/fetchware> on Unix when run as
root, and something like C</home/[username]/.local/share/Perl/dist/fetchware/>
when run nonroot.

This option is B<not> recommended unless you only want to change it for just one
fetchware package, because fetchware also consults the
C<FETCHWARE_DATABASE_PATH> environment variable that you should set in your
shell startup files if you want to change this globally for all of your
fetchware packages. For sh/bash like shells use:

    export FETCHWARE_DATABASE_PATH='/your/path/here'

=head2 user 'nobody';

Tells fetchware what user it should drop privileges to. The default is
C<nobody>, but you can specify a different username with this configuration
option if you would like to.

Dropping privileges allows fetchware to avoid downloading files and executing
anything inside the downloaded archive as root. Except of course the commands
needed to install the software, which will still need root to able to write
to system directories. This improves security, because the downloaded software
won't have sytem privileges until after it is verified, providing that what you
downloaded is exactly what the author uploaded.

Note this only works for unix like systems, and is not used on Windows and
other non-unix systems.

Also note, that if you are running fetchware on Unix even if you do not specify
the C<user> configuration option to configure what user you will drop privileges
to, fetchware will still drop privileges using the ubiquitous C<nobody> user.
If you do B<not> want to drop privileges, then you must use the C<stay_root>
configuration option as described below.

=head2 stay_root 'On';

Tells fetchware to B<not> drop privileges. Dropping privileges when run as root
is fetchware's default behavior. It improves security, and allows fetchware to
avoid exposing the root account by downloading files as root.

Do B<not> use this feature unless you are absolutely sure you need it.

=over

=item SECURITY NOTICE

stay_root, when turned on, causes fetchware to not drop privileges when
fetchware looks up, downloads, verifies, and builds your program. Instead,
fetchware will stay root through the entire build cycle, which needlessly
exposes the root account when downloading files from the internet. These files
may come from trusted mirrors, but mirrors can, and do get cracked:

=back

=head2 lookup_url 'ftp://somedomain.com/some/path

This configuration option specifies a url of a FTP or HTTP or local (file://)
directory listing that fetchware can download, and use to determine what actual
file to download and perhaps also what version of that program to download if
more than one version is available as some mirrors delete old versions and only
keep the latest one.

This url is used for:

=over

=item 1. To determine what the actual download url is for the latest version of this program

=item 2. As the base url to also download a cryptographic signature (ends in .asc) or a SHA-1 or MD5 signature to verify the contents match what the SHA-1 or MD5 checksum is.

=back

You can use the C<mirror> configuration option to specify additional mirrors.
However, those mirrors will only be used to download the large software
archives. Only the lookup_url will be used to download directory listings to
check for new versions, and to download digital signatures or checksums to
verify downloads.

=head2 lookup_method 'timestamp';

Fetchware has two algorithms it uses to determine what version of your program
to download:

=over

=item timestamp

The timestamp algorithm simply uses the mtime (last modification time) that is
availabe in FTP and HTTP directory listings to determine what file in the
directory is the newest. C<timestamp> is also the default option, and is the one
used if C<lookup_method> is not specified.

=item versionstring

Versionstring parses out the version numbers that each downloadable program has,
and uses them to determine the downloadable archive with the highest version
number, which should also be the newest and best version of the archive to use.

=back

=head2 gpg_keys_url 'lookup_url.com/some/path';

Specifies a file not a directory URL for a C<KEYS> file that lists all of the
authors' gpg keys for fetchware to download and import before using them to
verify the downloaded software package. 

If you come accross a software package whoose author uses gpg to sign his
software packages, but he does not include it in the form of a file on his main
mirror, then you can specify the C<user_keyring> option. This option forces
fetchware to use the user who runs fetchware's keyring instead of fetchware's
own keyring. This way you can then import the author's key into your own
keyring, and have fetchware use that keyring that already has the author's key
in it to verify your downloads.

=head2 user_keyring 'On';

When enabled fetchware will use the user who runs fetchware's keyring instead of
fetchware's own keyring. Fetchware uses its own keyring to avoid adding cruft to
your own keyring.

This is needed when the author of a software package does not maintain a KEYS
file that can easily be downloaded and imported into gpg. This option allows you
to import the author's key manually into your own gpg keyring, and then
fetchware will use your own keyring instead of its own to verify your downloads.

=over

=item LIMITAITON

C<user_keyring> when set to true requires that the user that fetchware is
running under have a real gpg keyring with keys that have been imported into it.
This is not the case B<unless> the C<user> option has been specified with a user
account with a proper home directory and gpg keyring for gpg to use. Because of
this limitation if you need to specify C<user_keyring> be sure to also specify
the C<user> option to specify a I<real> user account instead of the default fake
one C<nobody>.

Typically you would import the keys into your own user accounts gpg keyring, and
then you would specify your own username with the C<user> option to tell
fetchware to drop privs to your own user account to have access to your own gpg
keys.

=back

=head2 gpg_sig_url 'mirror.com/some/path';

Specifies an alternate url to use to download the cryptographic signature that
goes with your program. This is usually a file with the same name as the
download url with a C<.asc> file extension added on. Fetchware will also append
the extensions C<sig> and C<sign> if C<.asc> is not found, because some pgp
programs and authors use these extensions too.

=head2 sha1_url 'mastermirror.com/some/path';

Specifies an alternate url to download the SHA-1 checksum. This checksum is used
to verify the integrity of the archive that fetchware downloads.

You B<must> specify the master mirror site, which is your programs main mirror
site, because if you download it from a mirror, its possible that both the
archive and the checksum could have been tampered with.

=head2 md5_url 'mastermirror.com/some/path';

Specifies an alternate url to download the MD5 checksum. This checksum is used
to verify the integrity of the archive that fetchware downloads.

You B<must> specify the master mirror site, which is your programs main mirror
site, because if you download it from a mirror, its possible that both the
archive and the checksum could have been tampered with.

=head2 user_agent 'Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:24.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/24.0'

Specifies what C<user_agent> you would like fetchware to pretend to be when
downloading files using the HTTP protocol. Some sites annoying prevent some
user agents from working while allowing others. This allows you to pretend to
be a real browser such as Firefox if you need to.

=head2 verify_method 'gpg';

Chooses a method to verify your program. The default is to try C<gpg>, then
C<sha1>, and finally C<md5>, and if all three fail, then the default is to exit
fetchware with an error message, because it is insecure to install archives that
cannot be verified. The availabel options are:

=over

=item gpg - Uses the gpg program to cryptographically verify that the program you downloaded is exactly the same as its author uploaded it.

=item sha1 - Uses the SHA-1 hash function to verify the integrity of the download. This is much less secure than gpg.

=item md5 - Uses the MD5 hash function to verify the integrity of the download. This is much less secure than gpg.

=back

=head2 verify_failure_ok 'True';

Fetchware's default regarding failing to verify your downloaded Archive with
gpg, sha1, or md5 is to exit with an error message, because installing software
that cannot be cryptographically verified should never be done.

=over

=item SECURITY NOTICE

However, if the author of a program you want to use fetchware to manage for you
does not offer a gpg, sha1, or md5 file to verify its integrity, then you can
use this option to force Fetchware to install this program anyway. However, do
not enable this option lightly. Please scour the program's mirrors and homepage
to see which C<gpg_keys_url>, C<gpg_sig_url>, C<sha1_url>, C<md5_url>, or
C<user_keyring> you can use to ensure that your archive is verified before it is
compiled and installed. Even mirrors from sites large and small get hacked
regularly:

L<http://www.itworld.com/security/322169/piwik-software-installer-rigged-back-door-following-website-compromise?page=0,0>

L<http://www.networkworld.com/news/2012/092612-compromised-sourceforge-mirror-distributes-backdoored-262815.html>

L<http://www.csoonline.com/article/685037/wordpress-warns-server-admins-of-trojans>

L<http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9233822/Hackers_break_into_two_FreeBSD_Project_servers_using_stolen_SSH_keys>

So, Please give searching for a C<gpg_keys_url>, C<gpg_sig_url>, C<sha1_url>,
C<md5_url>, or C<user_keyring> for your program another try before simply
enabling this option.

=back

=over

=item NOTICE

C<verify_failure_ok> is a boolean configuration option, which just means its
values are limited to either true or false. True values are C<'True'>, C<'On'>,
C<1>, and false values are C<'False'>, C<'Off'>, and C<0>. All other values are
syntax errors.

=back

=head2 prefix '/opt/';

Controls the AutoTools C<./configuration --prefix=...> option, which allows you
to change the base directory that most software (software that uses AutoTools)
uses as the base directory for when they install themselves.

For example, most programs copy binaries to C<prefix/bin>, documentation to
C<prefix/docs>, manpages to C<prefix/man>, and so on.

=over

=item WARNING: C<prefix> only supports source code distributions that use GNU
AutoTools. These can easily be determined by the presence of certain files in
the the distributions main directory such as C<configure>, C<configure.in>, and
C<acinclude.m4>, and others. So, if your program uses a different build system
just include that system's version of AutoTools' C<--prefix> option in your
C<build_commands> configuration option.

=back

=head2 configure_options '--datadir=/var/mysql';

Provides options to AutoTools C<./configure> program that configures the source
code for building. Most programs don't need this, but some like Apache and MySQL
need lots of options to configure them properly. In order to provide multiple
options do not separate them with spaces; instead, separate them with commas and
keep single quotes C<'> around them like in the example below.

    configure_options '--datadir=/var/mysql', '--mandir=/opt/man',
        '--enable-module=example';

This option is B<not> compatible with C<build_commands>. If you use
C<build_commands>, than this option will B<not> be used.

=over

=item WARNING: C<configure_options> only supports source code distributions that use GNU
AutoTools. These can easily be determined by the presence of certain files in
the the distributions main directory such as C<configure>, C<configure.in>, and
C<acinclude.m4>, and others. So, if your program uses a different build system
just include that system's version of AutoTools' C<./configure> program in your
C<build_commands> configuration option.

=back

=head2 make_options '-j4';

This option exists mostly just to enable parallel make using the C<-j> jobs
option. But any list of options make accepts will work here too. Separate them
using commas and surround each one with single quotes C<'> like in the example
above.

=head2 build_commands './configure', 'make';

Specifies what commands fetchware will use to build your program. Building your
program includes configuring the source code to be compiled, and then the actual
compiling too. It does B<not> include installing the compiled source code. Use
C<install_commands>, which is described below, for that. Specify multiple
options just like C<configure_options> does.

The default C<build_commands> is simply to run C<./configure> followed by
C<make>.

=head2 install_commands 'make install';

This single command or perhaps list of commands will be run in the order your
specifyto install your program. You can specify multiple options just like
C<configure_options> does.

The default C<install_commands> is simply to run C<make install>.

=head2 uninstall_commands 'make uninstall';

This command or list of commands will be run instead of fetchware's default of
C<make uninstall>. Many source code distributions do not provide a C<uninstall>
make target, so they can not easily be uninstalled by fetchware without such
support. In these cases, you could look into
L<paco|http://paco.sourceforge.net/>, L<src2pkg|http://www.src2pkg.net/>, or
L<fpm|https://github.com/jordansissel/fpm>. These all aid turning a source code
distribution into your operating system's package format, or somehow magically
monitoring C<make install> to track what files are installed where, and then
using this information to be able to uninstall them.

=head2 no_install 'On';

This boolean, see below, configuration option determines if fetchware should
install your software or not install your software, but instead prints out the
path of its build directory, so that you can QA test or review the software before
you install it.

=over

=item NOTICE

C<no_install> is a boolean configuration option, which just means its
values are limited to either true or false. True values are C<'True'>, C<'On'>,
C<1>, and false values are C<'False'>, C<'Off'>, and C<0>. All other values are
syntax errors.

=back

=head2 mirror 'somemirror0.com/some/optional/path';

Your Fetchwarefile needs to have at least one mirror specified. Although you can
specify as many as you want to.

This configuration option, unlike all the others, can be specified more than
once. So, for example you could put:

    mirror 'somemirror1.com';
    mirror 'somemirror2.com';
    mirror 'somemirror3.com';
    mirror 'somemirror4.com';
    mirror 'somemirror5.com';

When fetchware downloads files or directories it will try each one of these
mirrors in order, and only fail if all attempts at all mirrors fail.

If you specify a path in addition to just the hostname, then fetchware will try
to get whatever it wants to download at that alternate path as well.

    mirror 'somemirror6./com/alternate/path';

=head1 FURTHER CUSTOMIZING YOUR FETCHWAREFILE

Because fetchware's configuration files, its Fetchwarefiles, are little Perl
programs, you have the full power of Perl at your disposal to customize
fetchware's behavior to match what you need fetchware to do to install your
source code distributions.

Not only can you use arbitrary Perl code in your Fetchwarefile to customize
fetchware for programs that don't follow most FOSS mirroring's unwritten
standards or use a totally different build system, you can also create a
fetchware extension. Creating a fetchware extension even allows you to turn your
extension into a proper CPAN distribution, and upload it to CPAN to share it
with everybody else. See the section below,
L<CREATING A FETCHWARE EXTENSION>, for full details.

=head2 How Fetchware's configuration options are made

Each configuration option is created with L<App::Fetchware::CreateConfigOptions>
This package's import() is a simple code generator that generates configuration
subroutines.  These subroutines have the same names as fetchware's configuration
options, because that is exactly what they are. Perl's
L<Prototypes|perlsub/Prototypes> are used in the code that is generated, so
that you can remove the parentheses typically required around each configuration
subroutine. This turns what looks like a function call into what could
believably be considered a configuration file syntax.

These prototypes turn:

    lookup_url('http://somemirror.com/some/path');

Into:

    lookup_url 'http://somemirror.com/some/path';

Perl's prototypes are not perfect. The single quotes and semicolon are still
required, but the lack of parens instantly makes it look much more like a
configuration file syntax, then an actual programming language.

=head2 The magic of C<use App::Fetchware;>

The real magic power behind turning a Perl program into a configuration file
sytax comes from the C<use App::Fetchware;> line. This line is single handedly
responsible for making this work. This one line imports all of the configuration
subroutines that make up fetchware's configuration file syntax. And this
mechanism is also behind fetchware's extension mechanism. (To use a
App::Fetchware extension, you just C<use> it. Like
C<use App::FetchwareX::HTMLPageSync;>. That's all there is to it. This I<other>
App::Fetchware is responsible for exporting subroutines of the same names as
those that make up App::Fetchware's API. These subroutines are listed in the
section L<FETCHWAREFILE API SUBROUTINES> as well as their helper subroutines.
See the section below L<CREATING A FETCHWARE EXTENSION> for more information on
how to create App::Fetchware extensions.

=head2 So how do I add some custom Perl code to customize my Fetchwarefile?

You use hook() to override one of fetchware's API subroutines. Then when
fetchware goes to call that subroutine, your own subroutine is called in its
place. You can hook() as many of fetchware's API subroutines as you need to.

=over

Remember your replackement subroutine B<must> take the exact same arguments, and
return the same outputs that the standard fetchware API subroutines do!

All of the things these subroutines return are later used as parameters to later
API subroutines, so failing to return a correct value may cause fetchware to
fail.

=back

=head3 hook()

    # Inside a Fetchwarefile...
    hook lookup => sub {
        # Your own custom lookup handler goes here!
    };

hook() allows you to replace fetchware's API subroutines with whatever Perl
code reference you want to. But it B<must> take the same arguments that each API
subroutine takes, and provide the same return value. See the section
L<FETCHWAREFILE API SUBROUTINES> for the details of what the API subroutine's
parameters are, and what their return values should be.

hook() should be used sparingly, and only if you really know what you're doing,
because it directly changes fetchware's behavior. It exists for cases where you
have a software package that exceeds the abilities of fetchware's configuration
options, but creating a fetchware extension for it would be crazy overkill.

    hook lookup => sub {
        # Your replacement for lookup() goes here.
    };

However, that is not quite right, because some of App::Fetchware's API
subroutines take important arguments and return important arguments that are
then passed to other API subroutines later on. So, your I<replacement> lookup()
B<must> take the same arguments and B<must> return the same values that the
other App::Fetchware subroutines may expect to be passed to them. So, let's fix
lookup(). Just check lookup()'s documentation to see what its arguments are and
what it returns by checking out the section L<FETCHWAREFILE API SUBROUTINES>:

    hook lookup => sub {
        # lookup does not take any arguments.
        
        # Your replacement for lookup() goes here.
        
        # Must return the same thing that the original lookup() does, so
        # download() and everything else works the same way.
        return $download_path;
    };

Some App::Fetchware API subroutines take arguments, so be sure to account for
them:

    hook download => sub {
        # Take same args as App::Fetchware's download() does.
        my $download_path = shift;
        
        # Your replacement for download() goes here.
        
        # Must return the same things as App::Fetchware's download()
        return $package_path;
    };

If changing lookup()'s behavior or one of the other App::Fetchware
subroutines, and you only want to change part of its behavior, then consider
importing one of the C<:OVERRIDE_*> export tags. These tags exist for most of the
App::Fetchware API subroutines, and are listed below along with what helper
subroutines they import with them. To check their documentation see the section 
L<FETCHWAREFILE API SUBROUTINES>.

=over

=item WARNING

If you specify a C<OVERRIDE_*> export tag to C<App::Fetchware> be sure to add
the C<:DEFAULT> export tag to B<also> export C<App::Fetchware>'s default
exports, which must be properly exported for fetchware to work properly.

    };

namespace polution, or install and use L<Sub::Import> if you demand more control
over imports.

=head2 A real example

See the section L<EXAMPLE FETCHWAREFILES> for real examples of using hook() to
change fetchware's behavior enough to make it work properly with different
source code distributions that are popular.

=head1 EXAMPLE FETCHWAREFILES

Below are example Fetchwarefiles. They use a range of features to show you what
Fetchware can do, and how it's Fetchwarefile can be manipulated to work with any
source-code distribution.

=head2 Apache Web Server

This Apache Fetchwarefile includes a few extra mirrors just in case one is down.
The fairly common C<-j 4> C<make_option> to make the build go faster, and a
gigantic C<configure_options> telling C<./configure> excatly how I want my
Apache built and configured. It also uses a heredoc to make its
C<configure_options> configuration option much more legible.

=over

    use App::Fetchware;

    program 'Apache';
    lookup_url 'http://www.apache.org/dist/httpd/';
    filter 'httpd-2.2';
    mirror 'http://apache.mirrors.pair.com/httpd/';
    mirror 'http://mirrors.ibiblio.org/apache/httpd/';
    mirror 'ftp://apache.cs.utah.edu/apache.org/httpd/';

    verify_method 'gpg';
    gpg_keys_url 'http://www.apache.org/dist/httpd/KEYS';

    make_options '-j 4';
    prefix '/home/dly/software/apache2.2';
    # You can use heredocs to make gigantic options like this one more legible.
    configure_options <<EOO;

    --enable-modules="access alias auth autoindex cgi logio log_config status vhost_alias userdir rewrite ssl"
    --enable-so
    EOO

=head2 NGINX Web Server

nginx has its distribution set up differently than Apache, so some changes are
needed. First, nginx does not seem to use any mirrors at all, which means
nginx's Fetchwarefile is going to look kind of stupid with the same exact URL
being used for both the C<lookup_url> and the C<mirror>, but such a
configuration is supported. Next, nginx does not have a KEYS file, but it does
list it's developer's keys on its Website. So, they have to be imported manually
into your keyring, and then specify the C<user_keyring> option to switch
fetchware from usings its own keyring to using your own keyring. Also, note the
comment regarding having to use the C<user> option to specify a real user
account. This is needed, because the verify step is done by fetchware's child
after that child drops its root privileges. Th default user is nobody, and
nobody has no real home, and therefore no keyring, so gpg won't be able to read
the keys you ask it to by using the C<user_keyring> option; therefore, C<user>
must be specified to change it to a real user, whoose keyring has had these keys
imported into it. Also, worth noting that this nginx configuration does not use
a C<filter> option. This is not actually needed, because the only source-code
packages availabe at the C<lookup_url> are the nginx software packages
themselves, but it might be a good idea to include one, because the nginx
developers could always change how their download server is structured. So,
including it is always a good idea.

=over

    use App::Fetchware;
    
    program 'nginx';
    
    # lookup_url and mirror are the same thing, because nginx does not seem to have
    # mirrors. Fetchware, however, requires one, so the same URL is simply
    # duplicated.
    lookup_url 'http://nginx.org/download/';
    mirror 'http://nginx.org/download/';
    
    
    # Must add the developers public keys to my own keyring. These keys are
    # availabe from http://nginx.org/en/pgp_keys.html Do this with:
    # gpg \

    # --fetch-keys http://nginx.org/keys/glebius.key\
    # --fetch-keys http://nginx.org/keys/nginx_signing.key
    # You might think you could just set gpg_keys_url to the nginx-signing.key key,
    # but that won't work, because like apache different releases are signed by
    # different people. Perhaps I could change gpg_keys_url to be like mirror where
    # you can specify more than one option?
    user_keyring 'On';
    # user_keyring specifies to use the user's own keyring instead of fetchware's.
    # But fetchware drops privileges by default using he user 'nobody.' nobody is
    # nobody, so that user account does not have a home directory for gpg to read a
    # keyring from. Therefore, I'm using my own account instead.
    user 'dly';
    # The other option, which is commented out below, is to use root's own keyring,
    # and the no_install option to ensure that root uses its own keyring instead of
    # nobody's.
    # noinstall 'On';
    verify_method 'gpg';

=head2 PHP Programming Language

PHP annoyingly uses a custom Web application on each of its mirror sites to
serve HTTP downloads. No simple directory listing is available. Therefore, to
use php with fetchware, custom C<lookup>, C<download>, and C<verify> hooks are
needed that override fetchware's internal behavior to customize fetchware as
needed so that it can work with how PHP's site is up.

The C<lookup> hook downloads and parses the L<http://www.php.net/downloads.php>
page, which lists files availabe for download. This file is parsed using
L<HTML::TreeBuilder> to determine the latest version. The MD5 sum is also parsed
out to verify the downloaded file as well.

The C<download> hook is only needed, because http_download_file() presumes that
the last part of the path is the filename you're downloading. And this is
annoyingly not the case with the way PHP has its downloading system set up.

The C<verify> hook just uses L<Digest::MD5> to calculate the md5sum of the
downloaded file, and compares it with the one C<lookup> parses out.

=head2 PHP Programming Language using its git VCS instead of download mirrors.

PHP like most open source software you can easily download off the internet uses
a version control system to track changes to its source code. This source code
repository is basically the same thing as a normal source code distribution
would be except VCS commands like C<git pull> are used to update it instead of
checking a mirror for a new version. The Fetchwarefile below for php customizes
Fetchware to work with php's VCS instead of the traditional downloading of
actual source code archives.

It overrides lookup() to use a local git repo stored in the $git_repo_dir
variable. To create a repo just clone php's git repo (see
http://us1.php.net/git.php for details.). It runs git pull to update the repo,
and then it runs git tags, and ditches some older junk tags, and finds only the
tags used for new versions of php. These are sorted using the C<versonstring>
lookup() algorithm, and the latest one is returned.

download() uses C<git checkout [latesttag]> to "download" php by simply changing
the working directory to the latest tag. verify() uses git's cool C<verify-tag>
command to verify the gpg signature. unarchive() is updated to do nothing since
there is no archive to unarchive. However, because we reuse build(), archive()
must return a $build_path that build() will change its directory to. start() and
end() are also overridden, because managing a temporary directory is not needed,
so, instead, they just do a C<git checkout master> to switch from whatever the
latest tag is back to master, because git pull bases what it does on what branch
you're in, so we must actually be a real branch to update git.

=head2 MariaDB Database

This example MariaDB Fetchwarefile parses the MariaDB download page to determine
what the latest version is based on what C<filter> option you set up. Once this
is determined, the download path is created based on the weird path that MariaDB
uses on its mirrors.

Like PHP MariaDB uses some annoying software on their Web site to presumably
track downloads. This software makes use of AJAX, which is vastly beyone the
capabilities of HTML::TreeBuilder to parse, because it needs a working
JavaScript environment. Therefore, the example Fetchwarefile below has no way of
verifying the MySQL downloads. This could be fixed by using a Perl Web scraping
module that can deal with JavaScript.

    # has a cache directory it can write to.

=head2 PostgreSQL Database

Below is a example Fetchwarefile that overrides lookup() to determine the latest
version, but manages to avoid overriding anything else. It uses the same style
as the rest downloading an HTML page that lists the version numbers on it
somewhere. Then it parses the HTML with HTML::TreeBuilder. It populates an
array, and then uses L<App::Fetchware>'s lookup_by_versionstring() to determine
which version is the latest one. This is then concatenated with a bunch of other
stuff to determine the $download_path.

MD5 verification is supported by simply specifying a C<md5_url> option, because
by default fetchware uses the C<lookup_url> to determine where to download the
md5sum from, but that won't work with PostgreSQL, because it's download system
has the md5sum on the download C<mirror> instead of the C<lookup_url>.

=head1 CREATING A FETCHWARE EXTENSION

=over

=item WARNING

Currently, fetchware's extension system is B<BETA>, and unlikely to change, but
changes may happen most likely just in the form of bug fixes. This, however, is
unlikely, but it could happen. Most likely, just some minor bug fixes will occur
to the API not any major changes or refactors or rewrites. I'm considering
"genericizing" make_test_dist() so Fetchware extension authors can reuse it to
test their extensions.

=back

Fetchware's main program C<fetchware> uses App::Fetchware's short and simple API
to implement fetchware's default behavior; however, other styles of source code
distributions exist on the internet that may not fit inside App::Fetchware's
capabilities. That is why, in addition to its flexible configuration file
syntax, fetchware allows modules other than App::Fetchware to provide it with
its behavior.

=head2 How the API works

When fetchware installs or upgrades something it executes the API subroutines
check_syntax(), start(), lookup(), download(), verify(), unarchive(), build(),
install(), and end() in that order. And when fetchware uninstalls an installed
package it executes the API subroutines check_syntax(), start(), unarchive(),
uninstall(), and end(). Upgrade is basically the exact same thing as install(),
but it compares version numbers using the upgrade() API subroutine. And
C<fetchware new> obviously just calls new() and new_install().

=head2 Extending App::Fetchware

This API can be overridden inside a user created Fetchwarefile by using hook()
as L<explained above|/So how do I add some custom Perl code to customize my Fetchwarefile?>.
hook() simply takes a Perl code reference that takes the same parameters, and
returns the same results that the subroutine that you've hook()ed takes and
returns.

For more extensive changes you can create a App::Fetchware module that
I<"subclasses"> App::Fetchware. Now App::Fetchware is not an object-oriented
module, so you cannot use L<parent> or L<base> to add it to your program's
inheritance tree using C<@INC>. You can, however, use
L<App::Fetchware::ExportAPI> to import whatever subroutines from App::Fetchware
that you want to reuse such as start() and end(), and then simply implement the
remaining  subroutines that make up App::Fetchware's API.  Just like the
C<CODEREF> extensions mentioned above, you must take the same arguments and
return the same values that fetchware expects or using your App::Fetchware
extension will blow up in your face.

This is described in much more detail below in L<CHANGING FETCHWARE'S BEHAVIOR>.

=head2 Essential Terminology

App::Fetchware manages to behave like an object oriented module would with
regards to its extension system without actually using perl's object-oriented
features especially using @INC for subclassing, which App::Fetchware does not
use.

The same terminology as used in OOP is also used here in App::Fetchware, because
the concepts are nearly the same--they're simply implemented differently.

=head3 API subroutines

These are the subroutines that App::Fetchware implements, and that fetchware
uses to implement its desired behavior. They are new(), new_install(),
check_syntax(), start(), lookup(), download(), verify(), unarchive(), build(),
install(), uninstall(), upgrade(), and end(). All must be
implemented or "inherited" from App::Fetchware using L<App::Fetchware::ExportAPI> as
discussed below in L<Implement your fetchware extension.> in a App::Fetchware
L<subclass>.

=head3 override

Means the same thing it does in object-oriented programming. Changing the
definition of a method/subroutine without changing its name. In OOP this is
simply done by subclassing something, and then defining one of the methods that
are in the superclass in the subclass. In App::Fetchware extensions this is done
by simply defining a subroutine with the same name as one or more of the API
subroutines that are defined above. There is no method resolution order and
C<@INC> is not consulted.

=head3 subclass

Means the same thing it does in object-oriented programming. Taking one class
and replacing it with another class. Only since App::Fetchware is not
object-oriented, it is implemented differently. You simply use
L<App::Fetchware::ExportAPI> to specify the L<API subroutines> that you are
B<not> going to override, and then actually implement the remaining subroutines,
so that your App::Fetchware I<subclass> has the same interface that
App::Fetchware does.

To create a fetchware extension you must understand how they work:

=over

=item 1. First a Fetchwarefile is created, and what module implements App:Fetchware's API is declared with a C<use App::Fetchware...;> line. This line is C<use App::Fetchware> for default Fetchwarefiles that use App::Fetchware to provide C<fetchware> with the API it needs to work properly.

=item 2. To use a fetchware extension, you simply specify the fetchware
extension you want to use with a C<use App::FetchwareX::...;> instead of specifying
C<use App::Fetchware> line in your Fetchwarefile. You B<must> replace the
App::Fetchware import with the extension's. Both cannot be present. Fetchware
will exit with an error if you use more than one App::Fetchware line without
specifying specific subroutines in all but one of them.

=item 3. Then when C<fetchware> parses this Fetchwarefile when you use it to install, upgrade, or uninstall something, This C<use App::FetchwareX::...;> line is what imports App::Fetchware's API subroutines into C<fetchware>'s namespace.

=back

That's all there is to it. That simple C<use App::Fetchware...;> imports from
App::Fetchware or a App::Fetchware extension such as
App::FetchwareX::HTMLPageSync the API subroutines (such as start(), lookup(),
..., install(), and uninstall()) C<fetchware> needs to use to install, upgrade,
or uninstall whatever program your Fetchwarefile specifies.

After understanding how they work, simply follow the instructons and consider
the recommendations below. Obviously, knowing Perl is required. A great place to
start is chromatic's
L<Modern Perl|http://www.onyxneon.com/books/modern_perl/index.html>.

=head2 Develop your idea keeping in mind fetchware's package manager metaphor

Fetchware is a package manager like apt-get, yum, or slackpkg. It I<installs>,
I<upgrades>, or I<uninstalls> programs. Fetchware is not a Plack for command
line programs. It has a rather specific API meant to fit its package manager
metaphor. So, keep this in mind when developing your idea for a fetchware
extension.

=head2 Map your extension's behavior to App::Fetchware's API

App::Fetchware has a specific behavior consisting of just a few subroutines with
specific names that take specific arguments, and return specific values. This
API is how you connect your extension to fetchware.

Just consider the description's of App::Fetchware's API below, and perhaps
consult their full documentation in L<FETCHWAREFILE API SUBROUTINES>.

=over

=item B<my ($program_name, $fetchwarefile) = new($term, $program_name)> -
Along with new_install() implements Fetchware's new command for helping users
create new Fetchwarefiles using a Q&Z wizard interface.

=item B<my $fetchware_package_path = new_install($program_name, $fetchwarefile)>
- new()'s sister subroutine for implementing the Q&A wizard interface for
Fetchware's new command. Just used to keep root to make
ask_to_install_now_to_test_fetchwarefile() work for system level installs while
keeping drop privs enabled by default.

=item B<'Syntax Ok' = check_syntax()> - Checks the user's Fetchwarefile, but only
at Fetchware's level. Perl level syntax errors are not checked. PPI is not used
to parse the file. Instead only high-level Fetchware specific syntax errors are
checked.

=item B<my $temp_dir = start(KeepTempDir => 0 | 1)> - Gives your extension a chance to do anything needed before the rest of the API subroutines get called.  App::Fetchware's C<start()> manages App::Fetchware's temporary directory creation. If you would like to also use a temporary directory, you can just use L<App::Fetchware::ExportAPI> to "inherit" App::Fetchware's start() instead of implementing it yourself.

=item B<my $download_url = lookup()> - Determines and returns a download url that C<download()> receives and uses to download the archive for the program.o

=item B<my $package_path = download($tempd_dir, $download_url)> - Downloads its provided $download_url argument.

=item B<verify($download_url, $package_path)> - Verifies the integrity of your downloaded archive using gpg, sha1, or md5.

=item B<my $build_path = unarchive($package_path)> - Unpacks the downloaded archive.

=item B<build($build_path)> - Configures and compiles the downloaded archive.

=item B<install()> - Installs the compiled archive.

=item B<end()> - Cleans up the temporary directory that start() created. Can be overridden to do any other clean up tasks that your archive needs.

=item B<uninstall($build_path)> - Uninstalls an already installed program installed with the same App::Fetchware extension.

=item B<$upgrade = upgrade($download_path, $fetchware_package_path)> - uses its
two arguments to determine if a new version is available to upgrade to, or if
the currently installed version is the latest version, and no additional
upgrades are needed.

=back

Also, keep in mind the order in which these subroutines are called, what
arguments they receive, and what their expected return value is.

=over

=item B<new> = Just new() and new_install().

=item B<install> - check_syntax(), start(), lookup(), download(), verify(), unarchive(), build(), install(), and end().

=item B<upgrade> - check_syntax(), start(), lookup(), I<upgrade()>, download(),
verify(), unarchive(), build(), install(), and end().

=item B<upgrade-all> - Is the same as upgrade, because it just call upgrade for
each fetchware package that is installed in the fetchware package database.

=item B<uninstall> - You might think its just uninstall(), but it does not.
check_syntax(), start(), unarchive(), uninstall(), and end().

=back

Use the above overview of App::Fetchware's API to design what each API
subroutine keeping in mind its arguments and what its supposed to return.

=head2 Determine your fetchware extension's Fetchwarefile configuration options.

App::Fetchware has various configuration options such as C<temp_dir>, C<prefix>,
and so on. Chances are your fetchware extension will also need such
configuration options. These are easily created with
L<App::Fetchware::CreateConfigOptions>, which manufactures these to order for
your convenience. There are four different types of configuration options:

=over

=item ONE - Takes only one argument, and can only be used once.

=item ONEARRREF - Can only be called once, but can take multiple agruments at once.

=item MANY - Takes only one argument, but can be called more than once. The only example is mirror.

=item BOOLEAN - Takes only one arguement, and can only be called once just like
ONE. The difference is that BOOLEANs are limited to only I<boolean> true or
false values such as C<'On'> or C<'Off'>, C<'True'> or C<'False'>, or C<1> or
C<0>. App::Fetchware examples include C<no_install> and C<vefify_failure_ok>.

=back

Using the documentation above and perhaps also the documentation for
L<App::Fetchware::CreateConfigOptions>, determine the names of your
configuration options, and what type of configuraton options they will be.

=head2 Implement your fetchware extension.

Since you've designed your new fetchware extension, now it's time to code it up.
The easiest way to do so, is to just take an existing extension, and just copy
and paste it, and then delete its specifics to create a simple extension
skeleton. Then just follow the steps below to fill in this skeleton with the
specifics needed for your fetchware extension.

=over

=item 1. Set up proper exports and imports.

Because fetchware needs your fetchware extension to export all of the
subroutines that make up the fetchware's API, and any configuration
options (as Perl subroutines) your extension will use, fetchware uses the helper
packages L<App::Fetchware::ExportAPI> and L<App::Fetchware::CreateConfigOptions>
to easily manage setting all of this up for you.

First, use L<App::Fetchware::ExportAPI> to be sure to export all of fetchware's
API subroutines. This package is also capable of "inheriting" any of
App::Fetchware's API subroutines that you would like to keep. An example.

    # Use App::Fetchware::ExportAPI to set up proper exports this fetchware
    # extension.
    use App::Fetchware::ExportAPI KEEP => [qw(new_install start end)],
        OVERRIDE => [qw(new check_syntax lookup download verify
        unarchive build install uninstall upgrade)]
    ;

There two types of subroutines ExportAPI helps you with:

=over

=item *

B<KEEP> - Specifies which API subroutines you will "keep" or perhaps "inherit"
from App::Fetchware. Usually this is just start() and end() to manage the
C<temp_dir> for you.

=item *

B<OVERRIDE> = Specifies which API subroutines you will "override," or implement
yourself.

=back

Second, use L<App::Fetchware::CreateConfigOptions> to create all of the
configuration options (such as C<temp_dir>, C<no_install>, and so on.) you want
your fetchware extension to have.

There are four types of configuration options.

=over

=item C<ONE> - Take one an only ever one argument, and can only be
called once per Fetchwarefile.

I<Examples:> C<temp_file>, C<prefix>, and C<lookup_url>.

=item C<ONEARRREF> - Takes one or more arguments like C<MANY>, but unlike
C<MANY> can only be called once.

I<Examples:> C<configure_options>, C<make_options>, and C<build_commands>.

=item C<MANY> - Takes one or more arguments, and can be called more than once.
If called more than once, then second call's arguments are I<added> to the
existing list of arguments.

I<Examples:> C<mirror>.

=item C<BOOLEAN> - Just like C<ONE> except it will convert /off/i and /false/i
to 0 to support more than just Perl's 0 or undef being false.

I<Examples:> C<verify_failure_ok>, C<no_install>, and C<stay_root>.

=back

Additionally, there is another type of configuration option that only
App::Fetchware::CreateConfigOptions uses:

=over

=item C<IMPORT> - Allows you to import already defined configuration options
from App::Fetchware into your Fetchware extension. For exmaple, you might also
want a C<temp_dir> or C<no_install> configuration option, and the C<IMPORT> type
allows you to easily import one and document the fact that it is imported.

An example.

    use App::Fetchware::CreateConfigOptions
        IMPORT => [qw(temp_dir no_install)],
        ONE => [qw(repository directory)],
        ONEARRREF => [qw(build_options install_options)],
        BOOLEAN => [qw(delete_after_download)],
    ;

These 2 simple use()'s are all it takes to set up proper exports for your
fetchware extension.

=item 2. Code any App::Fetchware API subroutines that you won't be reusing from App::Fetchware.

Use their API documentation from the section L<FETCHWAREFILE API SUBROUTINES> to
ensure that you use the correct subroutine names, arguments and return the
correct value as well.

An example for overriding lookup() is below.

    =head2 lookup()

        my $download_url = lookup();

    # New lookup docs go here....

    =cut

    sub lookup {

        # New code for new lookup() goes here....

        # Return the required $download_url.
        return $download_url;
    }

=head3 Use Fetchware's Own Libraries to Save Developement Time.

Fetchware includes many libraries to save development time. These libraries are
well tested by Fetchware's own test suite, so you too can use them to save
development time in your own App::Fetchware extensions.

These libraries are:

=over

=item L<App::Fetchware::Util>

Houses various logging subroutines, downloading subroutines, security
subroutines, and temporary directory managment subroutines that fetchware itself
uses, and you can also make use of them in your own fetchware extensions.

=over

=item * Logging subroutines - L<msg()|App::Fetchware::Util/msg()>, L<vmsg()|App::Fetchware::Util/vmsg()>, and L<run_prog()|App::Fetchware::Util/run_prog()>.

=over

=item * These subroutines support fetchware's command line options such as -v
(--verbose) and -q (--quiet).

=item * L<msg()|App::Fetchware::Util/msg()> should be used to print a message
to the screen that should always be printed, while
L<vmsg()|App::Fetchware::Util/vmsg()> should only be used to print messages
to the screen when the -v (--verbose) command line option is turned on.  

=item * L<run_prog()|App::Fetchware::Util/run_prog()> is a system() wrapper
that also supports -v and -q options, and should be used to run any external
commands that your App::Fetchware extension needs to run.

=back

=item * Downloading subroutines - L<download_file()|App::Fetchware::Util/download_file> and L<download_dirlist()|App::Fetchware::Util/download_dirlist()>.

=over

=item * L<download_file()|App::Fetchware::Util/download_file> should be used to
download files. It supports the following schemes ftp://, http://, or file://.
It simply downloads the file using Net::Ftp or HTTP::Tiny to the current working
directory.  

=item * L<download_dirlist()|App::Fetchware::Util/download_dirlist()> should be
used to download FTP, HTTP, or local directory listings. It is mostly just used
by lookup() to determine if a new version is available based on the information
it parses from the directory listing.

=back

=item * Security subroutines - L<safe_open()|App::Fetchware::Util/safe_open> and L<drop_privs()|App::Fetchware::Util/drop_privs()>.

=over

=item * L<safe_open()|App::Fetchware::Util/safe_open> opens the file and then
runs a bunch of file and directory tests to ensure that only the user running
fetchware or root can modify the file or any of that file's containing
directories to help prevent Fetchwarefiles from perhaps being tampered by other
users or programs.

=item * L<drop_privs()|App::Fetchware::Util/drop_privs()> forks and drops
privileges. It's used by fetchware to drop privs to avoid downloading and
compiling software as root. It most likely should not be called by
App::Fetchware extensions, because fetchware already calls it for you, but it is
there if you need it.  

=back

=item * Temporary Directory subroutines -
L<create_tempdir()|App::Fetchware::Util/create_tempdir()>,
L<original_cwd()|App::Fetchware::Util/original_cwd()>, and
L<cleanup_tempdir()|App::Fetchware::Util/cleanup_tempdir()>. Only needed if you
don't reuse App::Fetchware's own start() and end() subroutines that make use of
thse temporary directory subroutines for you.

=over

=item * L<create_tempdir()|App::Fetchware::Util/create_tempdir()> creates and
chdir()'s into a temporary directory using File::Temp's tempdir() function. It
also deals with creating a Fetchware semaphore file to keep C<fetchware clean>
from deleting any still needed temporary directories.

=item * L<original_cwd()|App::Fetchware::Util/original_cwd()> simply returns
what fetchware's current working directory was before create_tempdir() created
and chdir()'d into the temporary directory.

=item * L<cleanup_tempdir()|App::Fetchware::Util/cleanup_tempdir()> deals with
closing the fetchware semaphore file.

=back

=back

=item L<Test::Fetchware>

Test::Fetchware includes utility subroutines that fetchware itself uses to test
itself, and they are shared with extension writers through this module.

=over

=item * L<eval_ok()|Test::Fetchware/eval_ok()> - A poor man's Test::Exception
in one simple subroutine. Why require every user to install a dependency only
used for testing when one simple subroutine does the trick.

=item * L<print_ok()|Test::Fetchware/print_ok()> - A poor man's Test::Output in
one simple subroutine.

=item *
L<skip_all_unless_release_testing()|Test::Fetchware/skip_all_unless_release_testing()>
- Does just what it's name says. If fetchware's internal release/author only 
Environment variables are set, only then will any Test::More subtests that call
this subroutine skip the entire subtest. This is used to skip running tests that
install real programs on the testing computer's system. Many of Fetchware's
tests actually install a real program such as Apache, and I doubt any
Fetchware user would like to have Apache installed and uninstalled a
bagillion times when they install Fetchware.  Use this subroutine in your own
App::Fetchware extension's to keep that from happening.

=item * L<make_clean()|Test::Fetchware/make_clean()> - Just run_prog('make',
'clean') in the current working directory just as its name suggests.

=item * L<make_test_dist()|Test::Fetchware/make_test_dist()> - Use this
subroutine or craft your own similar subroutine, if you need more flexibility,
to test actually installing a program on user's systems that just happens to
execute all of the proper installation commands, but supplies installation
commands that don't actually install anything. It's used to test actually
installing software without actually installing any software.

=item * L<md5sum_file()|Test::Fetchware/md5sum_file()> - Used to provide a
md5sum file for make_test_dist() create software packages in order to pass
fetchware's verify checks.

=item * L<verbose_on()|Test::Fetchware/verbose_on()> - Make's all vmsg()'s
actually print to the screen even if -v or --verbose was not actually
provided on the command line. Used to aid debugging.

=back

=item L<App::Fetchware::Config>

App::Fetchware::Config stores and manages fetchware's parsed configuration file.
parse_fetchwarefile() from L<fetchware> does the actual parsing, but it stores
the configuration file inside App::Fetchware::Config. Use the subroutines below
to access any configuration file options that you create with
L<App::Fetchware::CreateConfigOptions> to customize your fetchware extension.
Also feel free to reuse any names of App::Fetchware configuration subroutines
such as C<temp_dir> or C<lookup_url>

=over

=item L<config()|App::Fetchware::Config/config()> - Sets and gets values from
the currently parsed fetchware configuration file. If there is one argument,
then it returns that configuration options value or undef if there is none.If
there are more than one argument, then the first argument is what configuration
option to use, and the rest of the arguments are what values to set that
configuration option to.

=item L<config_iter()|App::Fetchware::Config/config_iter()> - returns a
configuration I<iterator>. that when I<kicked> (called, like
C<$config_iter-E<gt>()>) will return one value from the specifed
configuration option. Can be kicked any number of times, but once the number of
configuration values is exhausted the iterator will return undef.

=item L<config_replace()|App::Fetchware::Config/config_replace()> - config() is
used to I<set> configuration options, and once set they I<cannot> be changed by
config(). This is meant to catch and reduce errors. But sometimes, mostly in
test suites, you need to change the value of a configuration option. That's
what config_replace() is for.

=item L<config_delete()|App::Fetchware::Config/config_delete()> - deletes the
specified configuration option. Mostly just used for testing.

=item L<__clear_CONFIG()|App::Fetchware::Config/__clear_CONFIG()> - An internal
only subroutine that should be only used when it is really really needed. It
I<clears> (deletes) the entire internal hash that the configuration options are
stored in. It really should only be used during testing to clear
App::Fetchware::Config's intenal state between tests.

=item L<debug_CONFIG()|App::Fetchware::Config/debug_CONFIG()> - prints
App::Fetchware::Config's internal state directly to STDOUT. Meant for debugging
only in your test suite.

=back

=item L<App::Fetchware::Fetchwarefile>

Helper OO class for new() API subroutine. Allows you to programatically build a
Fetchwarefile for the user using a small API instead of manually concatenating
tons of strings constantly worrying about wordwrap and whitespace.

=over

=item L<new() constructor|App::Fetchware::Fetchwarefile/new()> -
App::Fetchware::Fetchwarefile is actually Object-oriented unlike the rest of
Fetchware's internals, so new() is its constructor.

=item L<config_options()|App::Fetchware::Fetchwarefile/config_options()> - Used
to add the actual configuration options and their values to the Fetchwarefile
object.

=item L<generate()|App::Fetchware::Fetchwarefile/generate()> - Returns the
"generated" Fetchwarefile. This method does all of the string concatenation for
you in order to create the Fetchwarefile specfied in your new() and
config_options() calls.

=back

=item L<App::Fetchware's OVERRIDE_* export tags.|FETCHWAREFILE API SUBROUTINES>

App::Fetchware's main API subroutines, especially the crazy complicated ones
such as lookup(), are created by calling and passing data among many component
subroutines. This is done to make testing much much easier, and to allow
App::Fetchware extensions to also use some or most of these component
subroutines when they override a App::Fetchware API subroutine.

=over

=item L<new()'s OVERRIDE_NEW export tag.|new() API REFERENCE>

The export tag exports all of the helper subroutines new() uses to implement its
functionality. Some like get_lookup_url(), get_verification(), and
get_filter_option() are quite specific to App::Fetchware, but extension_name,
fetchwarefile_name(), opening_message(), prompt_for_other_options(), and
edit_manually() are nice and generic, and should be appropriate for any
Fetchware extension.

=item L<new_install()'s OVERRIDE_NEW_INSTALL export tag.|new_install() API REFERENCE>

new_install() only exports ask_to_install_now_to_test_fetchwarefile(), and most
Fetchware extensions should probably just "inherit" new_install(), because
new_install()'s only real purpose was making
ask_to_install_now_to_test_fetchwarefile() work when fetchware drops privs.

=item L<check_syntax()'s OVERRIDE_CHECK_SYNTAX export tag|check_syntax() API REFERENCE>

check_syntax() only has the check_config_options() helper subroutine that is
meant for reuse by Fetchware extensions, so they can check their syntax just as
Fetchware itself does.

=item L<lookup()'s OVERRIDE_LOOKUP export tag.|lookup() API REFERENCE>

This export tag is the largest, and perhaps the most important, because it
implements fetchware's ability to determine if a new version of your software
package is available. Its default is just a clever use of HTTP and FTP directory
listings.

See the section L<lookup() API REFERENCE> for more details on how to use these
subroutines to determine if new versions of your software is available
automatically.

=item L<download()'s OVERRIDE_DOWNLOAD export tag.|download() API REFERENCE>

Only exports the subroutine determine_package_path(), which simply comcatenates
a $tempdir with a $filename to return a properl $package_path, which unarchive
later uses. This is mostly its own subroutine to better document how this is
done, and to allow easier code reuse.

=item L<verify()'s OVERRIDE_VERIFY export tag.|verify() API REFERENCE>

Exports a family of subroutines to verify via MD5, SHA1, or GPG the integrity of
your downloaded package. MD5 and SHA1 are supported for legacy reasons. All
software packages should be GPG signed for much much much better security. GPG
signatures when verified actually prove that the software package you downloaded
is exactly what the author of that software package created, whereas MD5 and
SHA1 sums just verify that you downloaded the bunch of bits in the same order
that they are stored on the server.

digest_verify() an be used to add support for any other Digest::* modules that
CPAN has a Digest based module for that correctly follow Digest's API.

=item L<unarchive()'s OVERRIDE_UNARCHIVE export tag.|unarchive() API REFERENCE>

Exports subroutines that will help you unarchive software packages in tar and
zip format. The most important part to remember is to use list_files() to list
the files in your archive, and pass that list to check_archive_files() to ensure
that the archive will not overwrite any system files, and contains no absolute
paths that could cause havok on your system. unarchive_package() does the actual
unarchiving of software packages.

=item L<build()'s OVERRIDE_BUILD export tag.|build() API REFERENCE>

Provides run_star_commands(), which is meant to execute common override commands
that fetchware provides with the C<build_commands>, C<install_commands>, and
C<uninstall_commands> configuration file directives. These directives are of
type C<ONEARRREF> where they can only be called once, but you can supply a comma
separated list of commands that fetchware will install instead of the standard
commands default AutoTools commands (build() => ./configure, make; install() =>
make install; uninstall() => ./configure, make uninstall). See its
L<documentation|run_star_commands(config('*_commands'));> for more details.

=item L<install()'s OVERRIDE_INSTALL export tag.|install() API REFERENCE>

install() only exports chdir_unless_already_at_path(), which is of limited use.
install() also uses build()'s run_star_commands().

=item uninstall()'s OVERRDIE_UNINSTALL export tag.

uninstall() actually has no exports of its own, but it does make use of
build() and install()'s exports.

=item upgrade()'s OVERRIDE_UNINSTALL export tag.

upgrade() also has no exports of its own, and does not use anyone elses.

=back

=back

=head2 Write your fetchware extension's documentation

Fill in all of the skeleton's missing POD to ensure that fetchware extension has
enough documentation to make it easy for user's to use your fetchware extension.
Be sure to document:

=over

=item * All of Perl's standard POD sections such as SYNOPSIS, DESCRIPTION, AUTHOR, and all of the others. See L<perlpodstyle> for more details.

=item * Give each subroutine its own chunk of POD before it explaining its arguments, any App::Fetchware configuration options it uses, and what its return value is.

=item * Be sure to document both its external interface, its Fetchwarefile, and its internal interface, what subroutines it has and uses.

=back

=head2 Write tests for your fetchware extension

Use perls venerable Test::More, and whatever other Perl TAP testing modules you
need to be sure your fetchware extension works as expected.

L<Test::Fetchware/> has a few testing subroutines that fetchware itself uses
in its test suite that you may find helpful. These include:

=over

=item L<Test::Fetchware/eval_ok()> - A poor man's Test::Exception. Captures any
exceptions that are thrown, and compares them to the provided exception text or
regex.

=item L<Test::Fetchware/print_ok()> - A poor man's Test::Output. Captures
STDOUT, and compares it to the provided text.

=item L<Test::Fetchware/skip_all_unless_release_testing()> - Fetchware is a
package manager, but who wants software installed on their computer just to test
it? This subroutine marks test files or subtests that should be skipped unless
fetchware's extensive FETCHWARE_RELEASE_TESTING environement variables are set.
This funtionality is described next.

=item L<Test::Fetchware/make_clean()> - Just runs C<make clean> in the current
directory.

=item L<Test::Fetchware/make_test_dist()> - Creates a temporary distribution
that is used for testing. This temporary distribution contains a C<./configure>
and a C<Makefile> that create no files, but can still be executed in the
standard AutoTools way.

=item L<Test::Fetchware/md5sum_file()> - Just md5sum's a file so verify() can be
tested.

=item L<Test::Fetchware/expected_filename_listing()> - Returns a string of crazy
Test::Deep subroutines to test filename listings. Not quite as useful as the
rest, but may come in handy if you're only changing the front part of lookup().

=back

Your tests should make use of fetchware's own C<FETHWARE_RELEASE_TESTING>
environment variable that controls with the help of
skip_all_unless_release_testing() if and where software is actually installed.
This is done, because everyone who installs fetchware or your fetchware
extension is really gonna freak out if its test suite installs apache or ctags
just to test its package manager functionality. To use it:

=over

=item 1. Set up an automated way of enabling FETCHWARE_RELEASE_TESTING.

Just paste the frt() bash shell function below. Translating this to your
favorite shell should be pretty straight forward. Do not just copy and paste it.
You'll need to customize the specific C<FETCHWARE_*> environment variables to
whatever mirrors you want to use or whatever actual programs you want to test
with. And you'll have to point the local (file://) urls to directories that
actually exist on your computer.

    # Sets FETCHWARE_RELEASE_TESTING env vars for fully testing fetchware.
    frt() {
        if [ -z "$FETCHWARE_RELEASE_TESTING" ]
        then
            echo -n 'Setting fetchware_release_testing environment variables...';
            export FETCHWARE_RELEASE_TESTING='***setting this will install software on your computer!!!!!!!***'
            export FETCHWARE_FTP_LOOKUP_URL='ftp://carroll.cac.psu.edu/pub/apache/httpd'
            export FETCHWARE_HTTP_LOOKUP_URL='http://www.apache.org/dist/httpd/'
            export FETCHWARE_FTP_MIRROR_URL='ftp://carroll.cac.psu.edu/pub/apache/httpd'
            export FETCHWARE_HTTP_MIRROR_URL='http://mirror.cc.columbia.edu/pub/software/apache//httpd/'
            export FETCHWARE_FTP_DOWNLOAD_URL='ftp://carroll.cac.psu.edu/pub/apache/httpd/httpd-2.2.26.tar.bz2'
            export FETCHWARE_HTTP_DOWNLOAD_URL='http://mirrors.ibiblio.org/apache//httpd/httpd-2.2.26.tar.bz2'
            export FETCHWARE_LOCAL_URL='file:///home/dly/software/httpd-2.2.22.tar.bz2'
            export FETCHWARE_LOCAL_ZIP_URL='file:///home/dly/software/ctags-zip/ctags58.zip'
            export FETCHWARE_LOCAL_BUILD_URL='/home/dly/software/ctags-5.8.tar.gz'
            export FETCHWARE_LOCAL_UPGRADE_URL='file:///home/dly/software/fetchware-upgrade'
            export FETCHWARE_NONROOT_USER='YOURUSERNAME'
            echo 'done.'
        else
            echo -n 'Deleting fetchware_release_testing environment variables...';
            unset FETCHWARE_RELEASE_TESTING
            unset FETCHWARE_FTP_LOOKUP_URL
            unset FETCHWARE_HTTP_LOOKUP_URL
            unset FETCHWARE_FTP_MIRROR_URL
            unset FETCHWARE_HTTP_MIRROR_URL
            unset FETCHWARE_FTP_DOWNLOAD_URL
            unset FETCHWARE_HTTP_DOWNLOAD_URL
            unset FETCHWARE_LOCAL_URL
            unset FETCHWARE_LOCAL_ZIP_URL
            unset FETCHWARE_LOCAL_BUILD_URL
            unset FETCHWARE_LOCAL_UPGRADE_URL
            unset FETCHWARE_NONROOT_USER
            echo 'done.'
        fi
    }

Just run C<frt> with no args to turn FETCHWARE_RELEASE_TESTING on, and run it
once more to turn it off. Don't forget to reload your shell's configuration
with:

    $ . ~/.bashrc # Or whatever file you added it to is named.

Then inside your test suite just import skip_all_unless_release_testing() from
Test::Fetchware:

    use Test::Fetchware ':TESTING';

=item 2. Call skip_all_unless_release_testing() as needed

In each subtest where you I<actually> install anything other than a test
distribution made with make_test_dist(), begin that subtest with a call to
skip_all_unless_release_testing(), which will skip the whole subtest if
FETCHWARE_RELEASE_TESTING is not setup properly.

    subtest 'test install() for real' => sub {
        # Only test if during release testing.
        skip_all_unless_release_testing();
        
        # Tests that actually install non-trivial distributions such as ones
        # made by make_test_dist() go here.

        ....
    };

If you dislike subtests, or otherwise don't want to use them, then put all of
the tests that I<actually> install something into a SKIP block after the other
tests that all users will run at the end of your test file.

=back

=head2 Share it on CPAN

Fetchware has no Web site or any other place to share fetchware extensions. But
fetchware is written in Perl, so fetchware can just use Perl's CPAN. To learn
how to create modules and upload them to CPAN please see Perl's own
documentation. L<perlnewmod> shows how to create new Perl modules, and how to
upload them to CPAN. See L<Module::Starter> for a simple way to create a
skeleton for a new Perl module, and L<dzil|http://dzil.org/index.html> is beyond
amazing, but has insane dependencies and a significant learning curve.

=head2 Fetchware Extension Best Practices

Below are a few points to keep in mind when creating a Fetchware extension that
the documentation itself fails to mention prominently or that otherwise slip
through the cracks, but are still important to keep in mind while designing and
implementing a Fetchware extension.

=over

=item * Actually implement the new() API subroutine to help your Fetchware
extension's users create new Fetchwarefiles for your Fetchware extension. And
use L<App::Fetchware::Fetchwarefile> to help you generate the Fetchwarefile.

=item * Only use L<run_prog()|App::Fetchware::Util/run_prog()> to execute
external programs, because it supports Fetchware's verbose (-v) and quiet (-q)
options. If you really do need something else, then checkout run_prog()'s
documentation for how to see if verbose or quiet options are enabled.

=item * Use L<App::Fetchware::Util>'s logging subroutines msg() and vmsg() to
print messages out to your user to tell them what you are doing. I recommened a
msg() or two in each or of your main API subroutines, and then at least one
vmsg() in each and any helper subroutines you may write and use.

=back

=head1 FETCHWAREFILE API SUBROUTINES

The subroutines below B<are> Fetchwarefile's API subroutines or helper
subroutines for App::Fetchware's API subroutines. If you want information on
fetchware's configuration file syntax, then see the section
L<FETCHWAREFILE CONFIGURATION SYNTAX> for more information. For additional
information on how to keep or override these API subroutines in a fetchware
extension see the section L<CREATING A FETCHWARE EXTENSION>

=head2 new()

    my ($program_name, $fetchwarefile) = new($term, $program_name);

    # Or in an extension, you can return whatever list of variables you want,
    # and then cmd_new() will provide them as arguments to new_install() except
    # a $term Term::ReadLine object will precede the others.
    my ($term, $program_name, $fetchwarefile, $custom_argument1, $custom_argument2)
        = new($term, $program_name);

new() is App::Fetchware's API subroutine that implements fetchware's new
command. new() calls a bunch of helper subroutines that implement
the algorithm fetchware uses to build new Fetchwarefiles automagically for the
user. The algorithm is dead stupid:

=over

=item 1. Ask for lookup_url & download it.

=item 2. Analyze the contents of the output from the lookup_url.

=item 3. Build the Fetchwarefile according to the output.

=item 4. Ask other questions as needed.

=back

new() uses Term::UI, which in turn uses Term::ReadLine to implement the
character based question and anwser wizard interface. A Term::ReadLine/Term::UI
object is passed to new() as its first argument. new() also uses
L<App::Fetchware::Fetchwarefile> to help create and help generate the
Fetchwarefile for the user.

new()'s argument is the program name that the user has specified on the command
line. It will be undef if the user did not specify one on the command line.

Whatever scalars (not references just regular strings) that new() returns will
be shared with new()'s sister API subroutine new_install() that is called after
new() is called by cmd_install(), which implements fetchware's new command.
new_install() is called in the parent process, so it does have root permissions,
so be sure to test it as root as well.

=over

=item drop_privs() NOTES

This section notes whatever problems you might come accross implementing and
debugging your Fetchware extension due to fetchware's drop_privs mechanism.

See L<Util's drop_privs() subroutine for more info|App::Fetchware::Util/drop_privs()>.

=over

=item *

This subroutine is B<not> run as root; instead, it is run as a regular user
unless the C<stay_root> configuration option has been set to true.

=back

=back

=head2 new() API REFERENCE

Below are the API routines that new() uses to create the question and answer
interface for helping to build new Fetchwarefiles and fetchware packages.

=head3 extension_name();

    extension_name(__PACKAGE__);

This subroutine sets the name of the extension that this implementation of new()
wants to be called by. It should be C<App::FetchwareX::ExtensionName> the full
name of your extension to make looking it up in documentaiton easier.

All of new()'s API subroutines (everything in App::Fetchware's OVERRIDE_NEW
export tag) use extension_name() to deterime what the this extension should be
called. This is really only used in error messages and occasionally in some of
the questions that new's API subroutines will ask the user. But this subroutine
is important, because it allows extension authors to change all of the
C<App::Fetchware> references in the error messages to their own fetchware
extensions name.

extension_name() is a singleton, and can only be set once. After being set only
once any attempts to set it again will result in an exception being thrown.
Furthermore, any calls to it without arguments will result in it returning the
one scalar argument that was set the first time it was called.

=head3 opening_message();

    opending_message($opening_message);

opening_message() takes the specified $opening_message and just prints it to
C<STDOUT>. This subroutine may seem useless, you could just use print, but using
it instead of print helps document that what you're doing is printing the
opening message to the user.

=head3 fetchwarefile_name();

    # $fetchwarefile_name comes from the first command line option to fetchware
    # new: fetchware new $fetchwarefile_name, which is optional, hence the need
    # for fetchwarefile_name().
    sub new {
        my $fetchwarefile_name = shift;

        my $program_name = fetchwarefile_name($term, program => $fetchwarefile_name)

If when the user called C<fetchware new $fetchwarefile_name>, if they provided a
$fetchwarefile_name name on the command line, then fetchwarefile_name() simply
returns what the user provided, but if they did not, then $fetchwarefile_name in
the call to fetchwarefile_name() is going to be undef. In that case,
fetchwarefile_name() uses the provided Term::UI in the provided $term variable,
to ask the user what the name of their fetchwarefile should be, which it returns
back to the caller.

=head3 get_lookup_url()

    my $lookup_url = get_lookup_url($term);

Uses $term argument as a L<Term::ReadLine>/L<Term::UI> object to interactively
explain what a lookup_url is, and to ask the user to provide one and press
enter.

=head3 download_lookup_url()

    my $filename_listing = download_lookup_url($term, $lookup_url);

Attempts to download the lookup_url the user provides. Returns it after parsing
it using parse_directory_listing() from L<App::Fetchware> that lookup() itself
uses.

=head3 get_mirrors()

    my $mirrors_hashref = get_mirrors($term, $filename_listing);

    # $mirrors_hashref = (
    #   mirrors => [
    #       'ftp://some.mirror/mirror',
    #       'http://some.mirror/mirror',
    #       'file://some.mirror/mirror',
    #   ],
    # );

Asks the user to specify at least one mirror to use to download their archives.
It also reiterates to the user that the C<lookup_url> should point to the
author's original download site, and B<not> a 3rd party mirror, because md5sums,
sha1sums, and gpg signatures should B<only> be downloaded from the author's
download site to avoid them being modified by a hacked 3rd party mirror. While
C<mirror> should be configured to point to a 3rd party mirror to lessen the load
on the author's offical download site.

After the user enters at least one mirror, get_mirrors() asks the user if they
would like to add any additional mirrors, and it adds them if the user specifies
them.

The list of the mirrors the user specified is returned as a hash with only one
key C<mirror>, and a value that is an arrayref of mirrors that the user has
specified. The caller, then should call append_options_to_fetchwarefile() to add
this list of mirrors to the user's Fetchwarefile.

=head3 get_verification()

    my $verification_hashref = get_verification($term, $filename_listing, $lookup_url);

    # $verification_hashref = (
    #   gpg_keys_url => 'http://main.mirror/distdir',
    #   verification_method => 'gpg',
    # );

Parses $filename_listing to determine what type of verification is available.
Prefering gpg, but falling back on sha1, and then md5 if gpg is not available.

If the type is gpg, then get_verification() will ask the user to specify a
C<gpg_keys_url>, which is required for gpg, because fetchware needs to be able
to import the needed keys to be able to use those keys to verify package
downloads. If this URL is not provided by the author, then get_verification()
will ask the user if they would like to import the author's key into their own
gpg public keyring. If they would, then get_verification() will use the
C<user_keyring> C<'On'> option to use the user's public keyring instead of
fetchware's own keyring. And if the user does not want to use their own gpg
public keyring, then get_verification will fall back to sha1 or md5 setting
C<verify_method> to sha1 or md5 as needed.

Also, adds a gpg_keys_url option if a C<KEYS> file is found in
$filename_listing.

If no verification methods are available, fetchware will print a big nasty
warning message, and offer to use C<verify_failure_ok> to make such a failure
cause fetchware to continue installing your software.

Returns a hashref of options for the user's Fetchwarefile. You're responsible
for calling append_options_to_fetchwarefile() to add them to the user's
Fetchwarefile, or perhaps the caller could analyze them in some way, before
adding them if needed. The keys are the names of the configuration options, and
the values are their values.

=head3 get_filter_option()

    $filter_hashref = get_filter_option($term, $filename_listing);

    # $filter_hashref = (
    #   filter => 'user specfied filter option',
    # );

Analyzes $filename_listing and asks the user whatever questions are needed by
fetchware to determine if a C<filter> configuration option is needed, and if it
is what it should be. C<filter> is simply a perl regex that the list of files
that fetchware downloads is checked against, and only files that match this
regex will fetchware consider to be the latest version of the software package
that you want to install. The C<filter> option is needed, because some mirrors
will have multiple software packages in the same directory or multitple
different versions of one piece of software in the same directory. An example
would be Apache, which has Apache versions 2.0, 2.2, and 2.4 all in the same
directory. The C<filter> option is how you differentiate between them.

If a filter was provided by the user than it is returned as a hashref with
C<filter> as the key for use with append_options_to_fetchwarefile(), or for
further analysis by extension authors.

=head3 prompt_for_other_options()

    prompt_for_other_options($term,
        temp_dir => {
            prompt => <<EOP,
    What temp_dir configuration option would you like? 
    EOP
            print_me => <<EOP
    temp_dir is the directory where fetchware creates a temporary directory that
    stores all of the temporary files it creates while it is building your software.
    The default directory is /tmp on Unix systems and C:\\temp on Windows systems.
    EOP
        },
            ...
    );

Accepts a Term::Readline/Term::UI object as an argument to use to ask the user
questions, and a gigantic hash of hashes in list form. The hash of hashes,
%option_description, argument incluedes the C<prompt> and C<print_me> options
that are then passed through to Term::UI to ask the user what argument they want
for each specified option in the %option_description hash.

The user's answers are tallied up an returned as a hash reference.

=head3 edit_manually()

    $fetchwarefile = edit_manually($term, $fetchwarefile);

edit_manually() asks the user if they would like to edit the specified
$fetchwarefile manually. If the user answers no, then nothing is done. But if
the user answers yes, then fetchware will open their favorit editor either using
the C<$ENV{EDITOR}> environment variable, or fetchware will ask the user what
editor they would like to use. Then this editor, and a temporary fetchwarefile
are opened, and the user can edit their Fetchwarefile as they please. If they
are not satisfied with their edits, and wan to undo them, they can delete the
entire file, and write a size 0 file, which will cause fetchware to ignore the
file they edited. If the write a file with a size greater than 0, then the file
the user wrote, will be used as their Fetchwarefile.

=head2 new_install()

    my $fetchware_package_path = new_install($program_name, $fetchwarefile);

=over

=item Configuration subroutines used:

=over

=item All of them, because it calls bin/fetchware's cmd_install(),
which in turn calls all of the API subroutines that fetchware's install command
does.

=back

=back

Exists separate from new(), because new() drops privileges like most other
fetchware commands do. But the new command includes the ability to ask the user
if they want to install the associated program from their newly created
Fetchwarefile, which requires root privileges. Therefore, we must also have a
API subroutine that runs in the root privileged parent to that the install
commands will run with proper permissions when fetchware is run as root.

=over

=item drop_privs() NOTES

This section notes whatever problems you might come accross implementing and
debugging your Fetchware extension due to fetchware's drop_privs mechanism.

See L<Util's drop_privs() subroutine for more info|App::Fetchware::Util/drop_privs()>.

=over

=item *

When fetchware is run as root, new_install() is called in the parent process
with root permissions so that you can call the 
ask_to_install_now_to_test_fetchwarefile() helper subroutine. I suppose you
could do something else in your extension if it makes sense, but that's what
this API sub is intended for. The ask_to_install_now_to_test_fetchwarefile()
helper subroutine needs root permissions (Unless the Fetchwarefile has been
setup so that the user running it has access.), because it will call fetchware's
cmd_install() to directly cause fetchware to go ahead and install the previoulsy
generated Fetchwarefile.

=back

=back

=head2 new_install() API REFERENCE

The subroutines below are used by new_install() to provide the new_install functionality
for fetchware. If you have overridden the new_install() handler, you may want to use
some of these subroutines so that you don't have to copy and paste anything from
new_install.

App::Fetchware is B<not> object-oriented; therefore, you B<can not> subclass
App::Fetchware to extend it! 

=head3 ask_to_install_now_to_test_fetchwarefile()

    my $fetchware_package_path = ask_to_install_now_to_test_fetchwarefile($term, \$fetchwarefile, $program_name);
    my $fetchwarefile_filename = ask_to_install_now_to_test_fetchwarefile($term, \$fetchwarefile, $program_name);

This subroutine asks the user if they want to install the Fetchwarefile that
this subroutine has been called with. If they say yes, then the Fetchwarefile is
passed on to cmd_install() to do all of the installation stuff. If they say no,
then fetchware saves the file to C<"$program_name.Fetchwarefile"> or
ask_to_install_now_to_test_fetchwarefile() will ask the user where to save the
file until the user picks a filename that does not exist.

=over 
NOTE: ask_to_install_now_to_test_fetchwarefile() has an infinite loop in it! It
asks the user forever until they provide a filename that doesn't exist. Should a
limit be placed on this? Should it only ask just once?

=back

If you answer yes to install your Fetchwarefile, then
ask_to_install_now_to_test_fetchwarefile() will return the full path to the
fetchware package that has been installed.

=head2 start()

    my $temp_dir = start();

=over

=item Configuration subroutines used:

=over

=item temp_dir 

=back

=back

Creates a temp directory using File::Temp, and sets that directory up so that it
will be deleted by File::Temp when fetchware closes.

Returns the $temp_file that start() creates, so everything else has access to
the directory they should use for storing file operations.

=over

=item EXTENSION OVERRIDE NOTES

start() calls L<App::Fetchware::Util>'s create_tempdir() subroutine that cleans
up the temporary directory. If your fetchware extension overrides start() or
end(), you must call create_tempdir() or name your temproary directories in a
manner that fetchware clean won't find them, so something that does not start
with C<fetchware-*>.

If you fail to do this, and you use some other method to create temporary
directories that begin with C<fetchware-*>, then fetchware clean may delete your
temporary directories out from under your feet. To fix this problem:

=over

=item *

Use L<App::Fetchware::Util>'s create_tempdir() in your start() and
cleanup_tempdir() in your end().

=item *

Or, be sure not to name your temprorary directory that you create and manage
yourself to begin with C<fetchware-*>, which is the glob pattern fetchware clean
uses. I recommend using something like
C<App-FetchwareX-NameOfExtension-$$-XXXXXXXXXXXXXX> as the name you would use in
your File::Temp::temdir $pattern, with $$ being the special perlvar for the
curent processes id.

=over

=item *

start() is called in the parent with root privileges. This is done, so that when
the parent calls cleanup_tempdir() in its end() call, cleanup_tempdir() still
has a valid filehandle to the fetchware semaphore file, which is used to keep
C<fetchware clean> from deleting fetchware's temporary directories out from
under if you run a C<fetchware clean> while another process is running another
fetchware comand at the same time.

=head3 get_directory_listing()

    my $directory_listing = get_directory_listing();

Downloads a directory listing that lookup() uses to determine what the latest
version of your program is. It is returned.

=over

=item SIDE EFFECTS

get_directory_listing() returns a SCALAR REF of the output of HTTP::Tiny
or a ARRAY REF for Net::Ftp downloading that listing. Note: the output is
different for each download type. Type 'http' will have HTML crap in it, and
type 'ftp' will be the output of Net::Ftp's dir() method.

Type 'file' will just be a listing of files in the provided C<lookup_url>
directory.

=back

=head3 parse_directory_listing()

    my $file_listing = parse_directory_listing($directory_listing);

Based on URL scheme of C<'file'>, C<'http'>, or C<'ftp'>,
parse_directory_listing() will call file_parse_filelist(), ftp_parse_filelist(),
or http_parse_filelist(). Those subroutines do the heavy lifting, and the
results are returned.

=over

parse_directory_listing() returns to a array of arrays of the filenames and
timestamps that make up the directory listing.

=back

=head3 determine_download_path()

    my $download_path = determine_download_path($filename_listing);

Runs the C<lookup_method> to determine what the lastest filename is, and that
one is then concatenated with C<lookup_url> to determine the $download_path,
which is then returned to the caller.

Also calls lookup_determine_downloadpath() to determine the actual download path
from the $sorted_filename_listing returned by C<lookup_by_*()>.

=over 
=item SIDE EFFECTS
determine_download_path(); returns $download_path the path that download() will

=back

=head3 ftp_parse_filelist()

    $filename_listing = ftp_parse_filelist($ftp_listing);

Takes an array ref as its first parameter, and parses out the filenames and
timstamps of what is assumed to be C<Net::FTP->dir()> I<long> directory listing
output.

Returns an array of arrays of filenames and timestamps.

=head3 http_parse_filelist()

    $filename_listing = http_parse_filelist($http_listing);

Takes an scalar of downloaded HTML output, and parses it using
HTML::TreeBuilder to build and return an array of arrays of filenames and
timestamps.

=head3 file_parse_filelist()

    my $filename_listing = file_parse_filelist($file_listing);

Parses the provided filelist by C<stat>ing each file, and creating a properly
formatted timestamp to return.

Returns an array of arrays of filenames and timestamps.

=head3 lookup_by_timestamp()

    my $download_url = lookup_by_timestamp($filename_listing);

Implements the 'timestamp' lookup algorithm. It takes the timestamps placed in
its first argument, normalizes them into a standard descending format
(YYYYMMDDHHMM), and then cleverly uses sort to determine the latest
filename, which should be the latest version of your program.

=head3 lookup_by_versionstring()

    my $sorted_filename_listing = lookup_by_versionstring($filename_listing);

Determines the $sorted_filename_listing used by determine_download_path() by
cleverly C<split>ing the filenames (the first value of the array of arrays
input, $filename_listing) on C</\D+/>, which will return a list of version
numbers. Then, the cleverly splitted filename is pushed on to the input array,
and then the array is sorted based on this new value using a custom sort block.

lookup_by_versionstring() also discards any entries from $filename_listing that
do not have a version number in them, because without version numbers that entry
can not be sorted properly. And if it is left in, it could confuse fetchware
into figuring out the correct download path.

Also note, that both $filename_listing and lookup_by_versionstring()'s return
value, $sorted_filename_listing, B<must> both be arrayrefs of arrays. That is a
scallar pointing to an array of arrays.

=head3 lookup_determine_downloadpath()

    my $download_path = lookup_determine_downloadpath($file_listing);

Given a $file_listing of files with the same timestamp or versionstring,
determine which one is a downloadable archive, a tarball or zip file. And
support some hacks to make fetchware more robust. These are the C<filter>
configuration subroutine, ignoring "win32" on non-Windows systems, and
supporting Apache's CURRENT_IS_ver_num and Linux's LATEST_IS_ver_num helper
files.

=head3 gpg_verify()

    'Package Verified' = gpg_verify($download_path);

Uses the command-line program C<gpg> to cryptographically verify that the file
you download is the same as the file the author uploaded. It uses public-key
priviate-key cryptography. The author signs his software package using gpg or
some other OpenPGP compliant program creating a digital signature file with the
same filename as the software package, but usually with a C<.asc> file name
extension. gpg_verify() downloads the author's keys, imports them into
fetchware's own keyring unless the user sets C<user_keyring> to true in his
Fetchwarefile. Then Fetchware downloads a digital signature that usually
ends in C<.asc>. Afterwards, fetchware uses the gpg command line program to
verify the digital signature. gpg_verify returns true if successful, and throws
an exception otherwise.

You can use C<gpg_keys_url> to specify the URL of a file where the author has
uploaded his keys. And the C<gpg_sig_url> can be used to setup an alternative

functionality for fetchware. If you have overridden the unarchive() handler, you
may want to use some of these subroutines so that you don't have to copy and
paste anything from unarchive().

App::Fetchware is B<not> object-oriented; therefore, you B<can not> subclass
App::Fetchware to extend it! 

=head3 list_files()

    # Remember $files is a array ref not a regular old scalar.
    my $files = list_files($package_path;

list_files() takes $package_path as an argument to a tar'ed and compressed
package or to a zip package, and calls C<list_files_{tar,zip}()> accordingly.
C<list_files_{tar,zip}()> in turn uses either Archive::Tar or Archive::Zip to
list all of the files in the archive and return a arrayref to that list.

=head3 list_files_tar()

    my $tar_file_listing = list_files_tar($path_to_tar_archive);

Returns a arrayref of file names that are found in the given, $path_to_tar_archive,
tar file. Throws an exception if there is an error.

It uses C<Archive::Tar-E<gt>iter()> to avoid reading the entire tar archive
into memory.

=head3 list_files_zip()

    my $zip_file_listing = list_files_zip($path_to_zip_archive);

Returns a arrayref of file names that are found in the given, $path_to_zip_archive,
zip file. Throws an exception if there is an error.

=head3 unarchive_package()

    unarchive_package($format, $package_path)

unarchive_package() unarchive's the $package_path based on the type of $format
the package is. $format is determined and returned by list_archive(). The
currently supported types are C<tar> and C<zip>. Nothing is returned, but
C<unarchive_{tar,zip}()> is used to to use Archive::Tar or Archive::Zip to
unarchive the specified $package_path.

=head3 unarchive_tar()

    my @extracted_files = unarchive_tar($path_to_tar_archive);

Extracts the given $path_to_tar_archive. It must be a tar archive. Use
unarchive_zip() for zip archives. It returns a list of files that it
extracted.

=head3 unarchive_zip()

    'Extraced files successfully.' = unarchive_zip($path_to_zip_archive);

Extraces the give $path_to_zip_archive. It must be a zip archive. Use
unarchive_tar() for tar archives. It I<only> returns true for success. It
I<does not> return a list of extracted files like unarchive_tar() does, because
Archive::Zip's extractTree() method does not.

=head3 check_archive_files()

    my $build_path = check_archive_files($files);

Checks if all of the files in the archive are contained in one B<main>
directory, and spits out a warning if they are not. Also checks if
B<one or more> of the files is an absolute path, and if so it throws an
exception, because absolute paths could potentially overwrite important system
files messing up your computer.

=head2 build()

=item Configuration subroutines used:

=over

=item prefix

=item configure_options

=item make_options

=item build_commands

=back

=back

Changes directory to $build_path, and then executes the default build
commands of C<'./configure', 'make', 'make install'> unless your Fetchwarefile
specifies some build options like C<build_commands 'exact, build, commands';>,
C<make_options '-j4';>, C<configure_options '--prefix=/usr/local';>, or
C<prefix '/usr/local'>.

You can only specify C<build_commands> or any of the other three build options.
You cannot combine C<build_commands> with any of the other build options.

=over

=item LIMITATIONS
build() like install() inteligently parses C<build_commands>, C<prefix>,
C<make_options>, and C<configure_options> by just using Test::Parsewords to
parse out the string considering quotes, and then execute them using fetchware's
built in run_prog() to properly support -q.

Also, simply executes the commands you specify or the default ones if you
specify none. Fetchware will check if the commands you specify exist and are
executable, but the kernel will do it for you and any errors will be in
fetchware's output.

=item drop_privs() NOTES

This section notes whatever problems you might come accross implementing and
debugging your Fetchware extension due to fetchware's drop_privs mechanism.

See L<Util's drop_privs() subroutine for more info|App::Fetchware::Util/drop_privs()>.

=over

=item *

Under drop_privs() build() is executed in the child with reduced privileges.

The $build_path it returns is very important, because the parent process will
need to know this path, which is in turn provided to install() as an argument,
and install will then chdir to $build_path.

=back

=back

=head2 build() API REFERENCE

Below are the subroutines that build() exports with its C<BUILD_OVERRIDE> export
tag. run_configure() runs C<./configure>, and is needed, because AutoTools uses
full paths in its configuration files, so if you move it to a different location
or a different machine, the paths won't match up, which will cause build and
install errors. Rerunning C<./configure> with the same options as before will
recreate the paths to get rid of the errors.  

=head3 run_star_commands()

    run_star_commands(config('*_commands'));

run_star_commands() exists to remove some crazy copy and pasting from build(),
install(), and uninstall(). They all loop over the list accessing a C<ONEARRREF>
configuration option such as C<config('build_commands')>, and then
determine what the individual star_commands are, and then run them with
run_prog().

The I<"star"> simply refers to shell globbing with the I<"star"> character C<*>
meaning "any."

=head3 run_configure()

    run_configure();

Runs C<./configure> as part of build() or uninstall(), which also annoying needs
to run it.

=over

=item NOTE
run_configure() is a piece of build() that was chopped out, because uninstall()
needs to run C<./configure> too. The only reason uninstall() must do this is
because Autotools uses full paths in the Makefile it creates. Examples from
Apache are pasted below.

    top_srcdir   = /tmp/fetchware-5506-8ROnNQObhd/httpd-2.2.22
    top_builddir = /tmp/fetchware-5506-8ROnNQObhd/httpd-2.2.22
    srcdir       = /tmp/fetchware-5506-8ROnNQObhd/httpd-2.2.22
    builddir     = /tmp/fetchware-5506-8ROnNQObhd/httpd-2.2.22
    VPATH        = /tmp/fetchware-5506-8ROnNQObhd/httpd-2.2.22

Why arn't relative paths good enough for Autotools?

that path is currently part of the current processes current working directory.

=head2 check_syntax()

    'Syntax Ok' = check_syntax()

=over

=item Configuration subroutines used:

=over

=item none

=back

=back

Calls check_config_options() to check for the following syntax errors in
Fetchwarefiles. Note by the time check_syntax() has been called
parse_fetchwarefile() has already parsed the Fetchwarefile, and any syntax
errors in the user's Fetchwarefile will have already been reported by Perl.

This may seem like a bug, but it's not. Do you really want to try to use regexes
or something to try to parse the Fetchwarefile reliably, and then report errors
to users? Or add PPI of all insane Perl modules as a dependency just to write
syntax checking code that most of the time says the syntax is Ok anyway, and
therefore a complete waste of time and effort? I don't want to deal with any of
that insanity.

Instead, check_syntax() uses config() to examine the already parsed
Fetchwarefile for "higher level" syntax errors. Syntax errors that are
B<Fetchware> syntax errors instead of just Perl syntax errors.

For yours and my own convienience I created check_config_options() helper
subroutine. Its data driven, and will check Fetchwarefile's for three different
types of common syntax errors that occur in App::Fetchware's Fetchwarefile
syntax. These errors are more at the level of I<logic errors> than actual syntax
errors. See its POD below for additional details.

Below briefly lists what App::Fetchware's implementation of check_syntax()
checks.

=back

=back

=head2 check_syntax() API REFERENCE

check_syntax() uses check_config_options() to do the heavy lifting of Set Theory
to check that you do not use some configuration options that are not compatible
with other ones that you have used.

=head3 check_config_options()

    check_config_options(
        BothAreDefined => [ [qw(build_commands)],
            [qw(prefix configure_options make_options)] ],
        Mandatory => [ 'program', <<EOM ],
    App-Fetchware: Your Fetchwarefile must specify a program configuration
    option. Please add one, and try again.
    EOM
        Mandatory => [ 'mirror', <<EOM ],
    App-Fetchware: Your Fetchwarefile must specify a mirror configuration
    option. Please add one, and try again.
    EOM
        Mandatory => [ 'lookup_url', <<EOM ],
    App-Fetchware: Your Fetchwarefile must specify a lookup_url configuration
    option. Please add one, and try again.
    EOM
        ConfigOptionEnum => ['lookup_method', [qw(timestamp versionstring)] ],
        ConfigOptionEnum => ['verify_method', [qw(gpg sha1 md5)] ],
    );

Uses config() to test that no configuration options that clash with each other
are used.

It's parameters are specified in a list with an even number of parameters. Each
group of 2 parameters specifies a type of test that check_config_options() will
test for. There are three types of tests. Also, note that the parameters are
specified as a list not as a hash, because multiple "keys" are allowed, and hash
keys must be unique; therefore, the parameters are a list instead of a hash.

=over

=item BothAreDefined

Is used to test if one or more elements from both provided arrayrefs are defined
at the same time. This is needed, because if you specify C<build_commands> any
value you specify for C<prefix>, C<configure_options>, C<make_options> will be
ignored, which may not be what you expect or want, so BothAreDefined is used to
check for this.

Also, unlike C<Mandatory> and C<ConfigOptionEnum> this syntax checker does not
take a string argument that specifies an error message, because it takes the two
other values that you specifiy, and uses them to fill in its own error message.

=item Mandatory

Is used to check for mandatory options, which just means that these options
absolutely must be specified in user's Fetchwarefiles, and if they are not, then
the provided error message is thrown as an exception.

=item ConfigOptionEnum

Tests that enumerations are valid. For example, C<lookup_method> can only take
two values C<timestamp> or C<versionstring>, and ConfigOptionEnum is used to
test for this.

=back

=head2 end()

    end();

=over

=item Configuration subroutines used:

=over

=item none

=back

=back

end() is called after all of the other main fetchware subroutines such as
lookup() are called. It's job is to cleanup after everything else. It just calls
cleanup_tempdir(), which mostly just closes the C<fetchware.sem> fetchware
semaphore file used to lock each fetchware temporary directory so C<fetchware
clean> does not delete it out from under an concurrently running Fetchware
process.

It also calls the very internal only __clear_CONFIG() subroutine that clears
App::Fetchware's internal %CONFIG variable used to hold your parsed
Fetchwarefile. 

=over

=item EXTENSION OVERRIDE NOTES

end() calls L<App::Fetchware::Util>'s cleanup_tempdir() subroutine that cleans
up the temporary directory. If your fetchware extension overrides end() or
start(), you must call cleanup_tempdir() or name your temproary directories
in a manner that fetchware clean won't find them, so something that does not
start with C<fetchware-*>.

If you fail to do this, and you use some other method to create temporary
directories that begin with C<fetchware-*>, then fetchware clean may delete your
temporary directories out from under your feet. To fix this problem:

=over

=item *

Use L<App::Fetchware::Util>'s create_tempdir() in your start() and
cleanup_tempdir() in your end().

=item *

Or, be sure not to name your temprorary directory that you create and manage
yourself to begin with C<fetchware-*>, which is the glob pattern fetchware clean
uses.

end() runs in the parent process similar to start(). It needs to be able to
close the lockfile that start() created so that C<fetchware clean> cannot delete
fetchware's temporary directory out from under it.

=head1 FAQ

=head2 Why doesn't fetchware and App::Fetchware use OO or Moose?

One of my goals for fetchware was that its guts be pragmatic. I wanted it to
consist of a bunch of subroutines that simply get executed in a specific order.
And these subroutines should be small and do one and only one thing to make
understanding them easier and to make testing them a breeze.

OO is awesome for massive systems that need to take advandtage of inheritance or
perhaps composition. But fetchware is small and simple, and I wanted its
implementation to also be small and simple. It is mostly just two four
thousand line programs with some smaller utility files. If it were OO there
would be half or even a whole dozen number of smaller files, and they would have
complicated relationships with each other. I did not want to bother with
needless abstration that would just make fetchware more complicated. It is a
simple command line program, so it should be written as one.

Moose was out, because I don't need any of its amazing features. I could use
those amazing features, but fetchware's simple nature does not demand them.
Also, unless Moose and its large chunk of dependencies are in your OS's file
system cache,  Moose based command line apps take a few seconds to start,
because perl has to do a bunch of IO on slow disks to read in Moose and its
dependencies. I don't want to waste those few seconds. Plus fetchware is a
program not intended for use by experienced Perl developers like dzil is, which
does use Moose, and has a few second start up overhead, which is acceptable to
its author and maintainer. I also use it, and I'm ok with it, but those few
seconds might be off putting to users who have no Perl or Moose knowledge.

=head2 What's up with the insane fetchware extension mechanism?

Extension systems are always insane. dzil, for example, uses a configuration
file where you list names of dzil plugins, and for each name dzil loads that
plugin, and figures out what dzil roles it does, then when dzil executes any
commands you give it, dzil executes all of those roles that the plugins
registered inside you configuration file.

I wanted a configuration file free of declaring what plugins you're using. I
wanted it to be easy to use. dzil is for Perl programmers, so it requiring some
knowledge of Perl and Moose is ok. But fetchware is for end users or perhaps
system administrators not Perl programmers, so something easier is needed.

The extension mechanism was designed for ease of use by people who use your
fetchware extension. And it is. Just "use" whatever fetchware extension you want
in your Fetchwarefile, and then supply whatever configuration options you
need.

This extension mechanism is also very easy for Perl programmers, because you're
basically I<subclassing> App::Fetchware, only you do it using
L<App::Fetchware::ExportAPI> and L<App::Fetchware::CreateConfigOptions>. See
section L<Implement your fetchware extension.> for full details.

=head2 How do I fix the verification failed error.

Fetchware is designed to always attempt to verify the software archives it
downloads even if you failed to configure fetchware's verification settings. It
will try to guess what those setting should be using simple heuristics. First it
will try gpg verificaton, then sha1 verification, and finally md5 verification.
If all fail, then fetchware exit failure with an appropriate error message.

When you get this error message
L<read fetchware's documentation on how to set this up|/4. Add mandatory verification settings>.

=head2 How do I make fetchware log to a file instead of STDOUT?

You can't fetchware does not have any log file support. However, you can simply
redirect STDOUT to a file to make your shell redirect STDOUT to a file for you.

    fetchware install <some-program.Fetchwarefile> > fetchware.log

This would not prevent any error messages from STDERR being printed to your
screen for that:

    fetchware install <some-program.Fetchwarefile> 2>&1 fetchware.log

And to throw away all messages use:

    fetchware -q install <some-progra.Fetchwarefile>

or use the shell

    fetchware install <some-program.Fetchwarefile 2>&1 /dev/null

=head2 Why don't you use Crypt::OpenPGP instead of the gpg command line program?

I tried to use Crypt::OpenPGP, but I couldn't get it to work. And getting gpg to
work was a breeze after digging through its manpage to find the right command
line options that did what I need it to.

Also, unfortunately Crypt::OpenPGP is buggy, out-of-date, and seems to have
lost another maintainer. If it ever gets another maintainer, who fixes the newer
bugs, perhaps I'll add support for Crypt::OpenPGP again. Because of how
fetchware works it needs to use supported but not popular options of
Crypt::OpenPGP, which may be where the bugs preventing it from working reside.

Supporting Crypt::OpenPGP is still on my TODO list. It's just not very high on
that list. Patches are welcome to add support for it, and the old code is still
there commented out, but it needs updating if anyone is interested.

In the meantime if you're on Windows without simple access to a gpg command line
program, try installing gpg from the L<gpg4win project|http://gpg4win.org/>,
which packages up gpg and a bunch of other tools for easier use on Windows.

=head2 Does fetchware support Windows?

Yes and no. I intend to support Windows, but right now I'm running Linux, and my
Windows virtual machine is broken, so I can't easily test it on Windows. The
codebase makes heavy use of File::Spec and Path::Class, so all of its file
operations should work on Windows.

I currently have not tested fetchware on Windows. There are probably some test
failures on Windows, but Windows support should be just a few patches away.

So the real answer is no, but I intend to support Windows in a future release.

=head2 How do I configure a HTTP proxy for use with Fetchware?

Fetchware uses Perl's L<HTTP::Tiny> module to download files over HTTP. So, all
you need to do is configure HTTP::Tiny for use with proxies. This is done with
environment variables that can easily be set from your shell.

Set C<http_proxy> in the format C<http://host:port>. You can do this permanantly
for this session with:

    export http_proxy='http://example.com:8080'

Or once just for this invocation of fetchware:

    http_proxy='http://example.com:8080 fetchware new

See your OS's shell for more details regarding using and exporting environment
variables.

=head2 How do I get Fetchware to I<not> delete its temporary directory, so I can troubleshoot a fetchware failure.  

Use fetchware's C<-v> (verbose) and C<--keep-temp> command-line options. C<-v>
will turn on extra verbose messages that fetchware prints out detailing what its
doing and why. These messages will also list where fetchware's temporary
directory is. C<--keep-temp> tell fetchware to keep its temporary files and
directories and I<not> delete them. This way you can examine them to help
troubleshoot the problem, and see what's going on.

C<--keep-temp> should not be needed when the installation or upgrade of a
fetchware package or Fetchwarefile fails, because the temp file deletion code
will not run after an error occurs before fetchware exits failure.

Use C<fetchware clean> to delete this and any other left over fetchware
temporary directories or files.

=head1 SECURITY

App::Fetchware is inherently insecure, because its Fetchwarefile's are
executable Perl code that actually is executed by Perl. These Fetchwarefiles are
capable of doing everything someone can program Perl to do. This is why
App::Fetchware will refuse to execute any Fetchwarefile's that are writable by
anyone other than the owner who is executing them. It will also exit with a
fatal error if you try to use a Fetchwarefile that is not the same user as the
one who is running fetchware. These saftey measures help prevent fetchware being
abused to get unauthorized code executed on your computer.

App::Fetchware also features the C<user> configuration option that tells
fetchware what user you want fetchware to drop privileges to when it does
everything but install (install()) and clean up (end()). The configuration
option does B<not> tell fetchware to turn on the drop privelege code; that code
is B<always> on, but just uses the fairly ubuiquitous C<nobody> user by default.
This feature requires the OS to be some version of Unix, because Windows and
other OSes do not support the same fork()ing method of limiting what processes
can do. On non-Unix OSes, fetchware won't fork() or try to use some other way of
dropping privileges. It only does it on Unix. If you use some version of Unix,
and do not want fetchware to drop privileges, then specify the C<stay_root>
configuration option.

=head1 ERRORS

App::Fetchware does not return any error codes; instead, all errors are die()'d
if it's App::Fetchware::Config's error, or croak()'d if its the caller's fault.
These exceptions are short paragraphs that give full details about the error
instead of the vague one liner that perl's own errors give.
