NAME
    Media::DateTime - A simple module to extract the timestamp from media
    files in an flexible manner.

VERSION
    version 0.49

SYNOPSIS
      use DateTime;
      use Media::DateTime;
      my $dt = Media::DateTime->datetime( $file );
  
      # or more cleanly OO
      my $dater = Media::DateTime->new;
      my $dt = $dater->datetime( $file );

DESCRIPTION
    Provides a very simple, but highly extensible method of extracting the
    creation date and time from a media file (any file really). The base
    module comes with support for JPEG files that store the creation date in
    the exif header.

    Plugins can be written to support any file format. See the
    "Media::DateTime::JPEG" module for an example.

    If no plugin is found for a particular file (or the plugin returns a
    false vale) the file creation date as specified by the O/S is used.

    Returns a "DateTime" object.

METHODs
    new
      Constructor that returns a "Media::DateTime" object. Methods can be
      called on either the class or an instance.

              my $dt = Media::DateTime->new;

    datetime
      Takes a file as an arguement and returns a "DateTime" object
      representing its creation date. Falls back to the creation date
      specified by the filesystem if no plugin is available.

              my $dt = Media::DateTime->datetime( $file );
              # or
              my $dt = $dater->datetime( $file );

SEE ALSO
    See the excellent "DateTime" module which simplifies the handling of
    dates. See "Module::Pluggable" and "Module::Pluggable::Ordered" which
    are used to implement the plugin system. "Image::Info" is used to
    extract data from JPEG files for the "Media::DateTime::JPEG" plugin.

    Make sure you have configured the local time zone on your machine. See
    "DateTime::TimeZone::Local" for information on how the timezone is
    determined.
