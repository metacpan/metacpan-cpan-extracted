=item XML::Compile::SOAP11::Operation-E<gt>B<new>(%options)

C<input_def>, C<output_def> and C<fault_def> are HASHes which contain
the input and output message header, body and fault-header definitions
in WSDL1.1 style.

=head2 Modify

Operations are often modified by SOAP extensions.
See L<XML::Compile::SOAP::WSA|XML::Compile::SOAP::WSA>, for instance. Also demonstrated in
the FAQ, L<XML::Compile::SOAP::FAQ|XML::Compile::SOAP::FAQ>.

=over 4

=item $obj-E<gt>B<addHeader>( <'INPUT'|'OUTPUT'|'FAULT'>, $label, $element, %options )

Add a header definitions.  Many protocols on top of SOAP, like WSS, add
headers to the operations which are not specified in the WSDL.

[2.31] When you add a header with same $label again, it will get silently
ignored unless the $element type differs. An $element is either a full
type or a [3.00] prefixed type.

 -Option        --Default
  destination     undef
  mustUnderstand  undef

=over 2

=item destination => ROLE

[2.33] adds the destination attribute.

=item mustUnderstand => BOOLEAN

[2.33] adds the mustUnderstand attribute.

=head2 Handlers

Extends L<"Handlers" in XML::Compile::SOAP::Operation|XML::Compile::SOAP::Operation/"Handlers">.
 
=over 4

=item $obj-E<gt>B<compileClient>(%options)

Returns one CODE reference which handles the processing for this
operation. Options C<transporter>, C<transport_hook>, and
C<endpoint> are passed to L<compileTransporter()|XML::Compile::SOAP::Operation/"Handlers">.

You pass that CODE reference an input message of the correct
type, as pure Perl HASH structure.  An 'request-response' operation
will return then answer, or C<undef> in case of failure.  An 'one-way'
operation with return C<undef> in case of failure, and a true value
when successful.

You B<cannot> pass options for L<XML::Compile::Schema::compile()|XML::Compile::Schema/"Compilers">, like
C<<sloppy_integers => 0>>, hooks or typemaps this way. Provide these to
the C<::WSDL> or other C<::Cache> object which defines the types, via
C<new> option C<opts_rw> and friends.

=item $obj-E<gt>B<compileHandler>(%options)

Prepare the routines which will decode the request and encode the answer,
as will be run on the server. The L<XML::Compile::SOAP::Server|XML::Compile::SOAP::Server> will
connect these. All %options will get passed to
L<XML::Compile::SOAP11::Server::compileHandler()|XML::Compile::SOAP::Server/"Actions">

 -Option  --Default
  callback  <required>
  selector  <from input def>

=over 2

=item callback => CODE

=item selector => CODE

Determines whether the handler belongs to a received message.

=over 4

=item $obj-E<gt>B<explain>($wsdl, $format, $direction, %options)

[since 2.13]

Dump an annotated structure showing how the operation works, helping
developers to understand the schema. The $format must be string "PERL".
($format "XML" is not yet supported)

When the $direction is string "INPUT", it will return the message which
the client sends to the server (input for the server). The "OUTPUT"
message is sent as response by the server.

All %options besides those described here are passed to
L<XML::Compile::Schema::template()|XML::Compile::Schema/"Compilers">, when C<recurse> is enabled.

 -Option     --Default
  recurse      <false>
  skip_header  <false>

=over 2

=item recurse => BOOLEAN

Append the templates of all the part structures.

=item skip_header => BOOLEAN
