  Features

   - First release.
   - Checks to see if the system SWI-Prolog can build against Perl. There is
     currently a bug where SWI-Prolog has an exported symbol PL_version that
     conflicts with a symbol in Perl <https://github.com/SWI-Prolog/swipl-devel/issues/900>.
     If the system SWI-Prolog does not work, builds a share install.
