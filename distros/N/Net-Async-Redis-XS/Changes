Revision history for Net-Async-Redis-XS

0.011     2023-06-29 12:21:07+08:00 Asia/Singapore
    [Bugs fixed]
    - Net::Async::Redis::Cluster::XS `->bootstrap` needs to load Syntax::Keyword::Try
    - Ensure all nodes in the cluster are using the ::XS version, some requests were
    still going through plain Perl

0.009     2023-02-10 18:11:54+08:00 Asia/Singapore
    [Dependencies]

0.008     2022-12-13 09:24:53+08:00 Asia/Singapore

    - pubsub callback takes a list, not an arrayref

0.007     2022-12-06 11:37:59+08:00 Asia/Singapore
    [Bugs fixed]
    - decimal (floating point) value conversion upgraded from `float` to `double`,
    and switched to Perl number-parsing routine for better accuracy (technically
    allows slightly more than the official protocol, but better than rolling our own)

    [Refactoring]
    - applied some improvements as suggested by PEVANS (thanks!)

    [Bugs fixed]

    [Dependencies]
    - previous `cpanfile` did not list dependencies, now resolved
