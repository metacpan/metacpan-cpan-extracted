IO-Socket-Telnet 0.03

Telnet is a simple protocol that sits on top of TCP/IP. It handles the
negotiation of various options, both about the connection itself (ECHO)
and the setup of both sides of the party (NAWS, TTYPE).

This is a wrapper around IO::Socket::INET that both strips out the telnet
escape sequences and lets you handle the negotiation in a high-level manner.

There is currently no interface for defining callbacks. This will be rectified
very soon. The module as it stands is still useful for stripping out telnet
escape sequences.

This module is likely missing large parts of the telnet spec. Please let me
know if you need particular things implemented. Failing test cases are the
best bug reports!

    0.03: socket creation failure propagated properly
