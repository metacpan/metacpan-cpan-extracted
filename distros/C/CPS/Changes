Revision history for CPS

0.18    CHANGES:
         * Moved CPS::Future out to its own distribution, Future. Retained a
           small back-compat wrapper for now
         * Implement gkpar in terms of gkforeach so it respects the governor's
           ->enter method

0.17    CHANGES:
         * Supply ->done_cb, ->fail_cb, ->cancel_cb callback-generation
           methods to CPS::Future
         * Allow future chaining for cancellation

0.16    CHANGES:
         * Allow passing CPS::Future objects into others for on_ready, on_done
           and on_fail callbacks (RT78432)
         * Override calling on a CPS::Future to invoke ->done directly

0.15    CHANGES:
         * More work on CPS::Future - added ->and_then, ->transform

0.14    CHANGES:
         * Handle Carp 1.25's new message format - RT 75377

0.13    CHANGES:
         * More work on CPS::Future - added cancellation, on_fail/on_done,
           needs_all constructor
         * Also build_requires Test::Fatal

0.12    CHANGES:
         * Some initial work on CPS::Future

0.11    CHANGES:
         * Added kpareach()
         * Renamed kloop() to kwhile(); added transparent back-compatibility
           redirect

0.10    CHANGES:
         * Moved data-flow functional functions into their own CPS::Functional
           namespace
         * Don't check ref($k) eq "CODE" - may get in the way of Clever Tricks
           (e.g. callable objects)

        BUGFIXES:
         * Scrub @_ in continuation from kwhile() and kpar() - fixes RT 55787
         * Implement gkwhile() using a fixpoint combinator to avoid weakref
           bugs on perl 5.6 entirely

0.09    CHANGES:
         * Added kseq()
         * Minor documentation updates
         * Skip t/32leakcheck.t before perl version 5.8.0

0.08    CHANGES:
         * Added kpar()
         * Only opportunisticly use Sub::Name, don't hard-depend on it in case
           of pure-perl scenarios

0.07    CHANGES:
         * Added note about perl before 5.8 not implementing weaken properly,
           so possible memory leaks if gkwhile()'s continuations are lost

        BUGFIXES:
         * Second attempt at making gkwhile() work on perl 5.6

0.06    CHANGES:
         * Created CPS::Governor::Deferred
         * Use Sub::Name to correctly name the gkwhile iteration closure

0.05    CHANGES:
         * Added kdescendd() and kdescendb()
         * (Hopefully) work on perl 5.6 again
         * Created the concept of a Governor and implemented a simple one

0.04    CHANGES:
         * Added dropk() analogous to liftk()
         * Added 'use warnings'
         * Various small updates to keep CPANTS happy

0.03    BUGFIXES:
         * Declare dependency on at least perl 5.8 since weaken() fails tests on
           earlier perls

0.02    CHANGES:
         * Use Scalar::Util::weaken() in kwhile(), breaking cycle for $iter
           and allowing body to care less about leaks. Also allows passthrough
           of $k without intermediate sub{}

0.01    First version, released on an unsuspecting world.
