Revision history for Perl extension Test::Mock::Simple.

0.10 Sat Jan 25 16:50:00 2019
    - added module_location
      This change fixes an old bug report that I didn't think could be solved.
      https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=95826
      (Better late than never!)
      This allows you to tell Test::Mock::Simple where to find the modules if
      the namespace does not translate into the file that it is located in.

    - add no_load option

0.081 Thu Dec 18 14:07:00 2014
    - fix tarball - used Mac's broken tar to create the tardist

    - Removed my debugging module which I accidentally deployed

0.07  Sat Dec  6 20:48:00 2014
	- Added 'allow_new_methods' flag
      This breaks backwards compatibility, however, the arguments for including
      this flag have been persuasive enough for me to break it.
      Hopefully, this only creates a small headache for anyone using Test::Mock::Simple.
