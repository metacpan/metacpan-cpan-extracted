added need_new_hash()

fixed spelling in POD

Forgot to recompile the grammar in the last version, so inline modifiers
only worked when CODEPERL_DEV was set. Added a rule to Makefile.PL to
recomile the grammar when the grammar file changes.

added support for compiled modifiers

fixed a problem that occurred in taint mode if you didn't load Code::Perl

grammar will be recompiled every time, useful if you're changing the grammar

added use warnings and Test::NoWarnings everywhere

added bin/ with compile and buildparser
