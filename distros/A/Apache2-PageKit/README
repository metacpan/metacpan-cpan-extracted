Apache::PageKit
===============

Status
------
	Version: 1.17

Description
-----------
	PageKit is a web applications framework that is based on mod_perl.
	This framework is distinguished from others such as Embperl and Mason
	by providing a clear separation of programming, content and
	presentation.

	It does this by implementing a Model/View/Content/Controller (MVCC)
	design paradigm:
		- Model is user supplied Perl Classes
		- View is set of PageKit Templates and/or XSLT files
		- Content is set of XML Files
		- Controller is PageKit

	This allows your programmers, designers and content editors to work
	independently with clean well-defined interfaces.

	PageKit provides the following features:
		- Component-based architecture
		- Language Localization and charset translation
		- Session Management
		- Input Validation
		- Sticky HTML Forms
		- Authentication
		- Co-branding and XML,WML, and PDF output
		- Automatic Dispatching of URIs
		- Easy Error Handling
		- Online Editing Tools
		- Page based sessions
		- Localized error/messages

------------
	- perl 5.006001 or greater
	- mod_perl 1.9916
	- Apache 2
	- libapreq2

	- Apache::SessionX
	- Compress::Zlib

        - libxml2 library - download from http://www.xmlsoft.org
	- XML::LibXML 1.31

Required for example web site located in eg/ directory
----------------------
	- DBD::SQLite
	- HTTP::Headers
	- Apache::Reload

Recommended
-----------
	- Mail::Mailer (needed if you use Apache::ErrorReport)
	- Apache::DBI (*strongly* recommended if you use DBI)
	- MIME::Types (needed if you want to serve static files from
		View/Default directory)
	- XML::LibXSLT 1.31 (needed if you want to use XSLT tranformations)
	- Apache XML FOP - need for generating PDF
        - Locale::gettext 1.01 (needed if you want to localize pkit messages)

Installation
------------

	You must have a mod_perl enabled apache server. That's all.

	After installing the requirements, you can use the standard

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install

Setting up Included Example PageKit Site
----------------------------------------

	An example web site is included in the eg/ directory.  This is an
	good starting point for building your own website.  See eg/README
	for more details.

	Make sure httpd is found in your PATH. 
	To setup and configure, run
		
	./t/TEST -start-httpd

	This will be used to configure and start a PageKit enabled 
	web server on port 8529.

	and killed by

	./t/TEST -stop-httpd

	To view the site, point your browser to http://localhost:8529/
	(Replace localhost with the name of the server, if necessary)

	If this page fails to load, you may find the error in t/logs/error_log.
	
	Note that to test the PDF generation, you will have to download the
	Apache XML FOP Processor from http://xml.apache.org/fop/ and 
	configure the path to the processor using fop_command configuration
	directive in Config.xml.

	Please note that the above is only for a quick test. 
	If you like to start on a new application take a look into 
	./t/conf/httpd.conf.
	
	To start a new application read Setup and Configuration in this
	README
	
Upgrading
---------
	To upgrade from an earlier version of PageKit see migration/README.
	You may have to change your Model, View, Content, or Config files. 

Setup
-----
	You should use the directories and files contained in the eg/
	directory of the distribution as a starting point for your own
	application.

	Note that the example application uses DBD::SQLite to store the
	login data.  This is choosen because it will work on any platform
	and support a resonable part of SQL.
	However, when building your own application you can change to 
	whartever database you like.
	
	Just provide a database with the tables 'pkit_user' and 'session'
	
	CREATE 
	  TABLE pkit_user (
            user_id CHAR(8), login CHAR(255), email CHAR(255), passwd CHAR(255)
        );
        
        CREATE 
          TABLE sessions (
            id char(32) not null primary key, a_session text
        );

        You can adjust or remove database fields from these tables as you like,
        just supply the fields you use. My pkit_user table is typical larger and I
        like to use VARCHAR on some fields.
	
	Note for Win32 user: 
	  On Win32 you should use a session_lock_class => 'Null'
	  in the eg site if you encount any problems. At least for me
	  session_lock_class => 'File' is not working.

	For the example application to work on a real database you must
	create the above table on it as well.

	For sessions to work, you will have
	to manually create a database 'sessions', and include a table (this
	example is for MySQL/PostgreSQL/SQLite, adjust as needed for your
        target database)

		CREATE TABLE sessions (
			id char(32) not null primary key,
			a_session text
		);

        A MySQL configuration inside Common.pm might look like:
		sub pkit_session_setup {
		  my $model = shift;
		  my $dbh = $model->dbh;

		  my %session_setup = (
			session_store_class => 'MySQL',
			session_lock_class  => 'MySQL',
			session_args => {
					 Handle     => $dbh,
					 LockHandle => $dbh,
                                        }
		  );
		  return \%session_setup;
		}


	A PostgreSQL configuration inside Common.pm might look like:
		sub pkit_session_setup {
		  my $model = shift;
		  my $dbh = $model->dbh;

		  my %session_setup = (
			session_store_class     => 'Postgres',
			session_lock_class      => 'Null',
			session_serialize_class => 'Base64',
			session_args => {
					 Handle   => $dbh,
                                         IDLength => 32,
                                         Commit   => 0,
                                        }
		  );
		  return \%session_setup;
		}

	Postgres user MUST use the Commit parameter in the session_args no
        matter if it is on or off.
        Look in Apache::Session::Postgres and Apache::Session.


        A SQLite configuration inside Common.pm might look like:
                sub pkit_session_setup {
                  my $model = shift;
                  my $dbh = $model->dbh;
                
                  my %session_setup = (
                        session_store_class     => 'MySQL',
                        session_lock_class      => 'Null',
                        session_serialize_class => 'Base64',
                        session_args => {
                                         Handle => $dbh,
                        },
                  );
                  return \%session_setup;
                }
        For more information look in Apache::Session::SQLite,
        Apache::Session::Flex and Apache::Session.

		PerlRequire /path/to/startup.pl
		PerlModule Apache::ErrorReport
		PerlSetVar ErrorReportHandler display

	and changing the settings in

		/path/to/pagekit/files/Config/Config.xml
