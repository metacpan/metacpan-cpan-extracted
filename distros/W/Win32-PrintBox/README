Win32::PrintBox - Redirects print STDOUT and warn statements to a message box under wperl

Version 0.01

SYNOPSIS

    use Win32::PrintBox;
    
    print "Program output\n";
    warn "I am here\n";

This module makes a perl script act like a windows application when started with 
wperl.exe, using message boxes. It has no effect when scripts are executed from 
a shell.

For perl (not wperl) scripts started from Explorer, or any other windows 
application, a final "Press any key to continue" is added, to allowing the user 
to see all output before the console window closes.
