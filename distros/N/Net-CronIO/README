NAME
    Net::CronIO - Perl binding for cron.io

VERSION
    version 0.01

SYNOPSIS
      use 5.014;
      use Net::CronIO;

      my $cron = Net::CronIO->new(
          api_username => 'example',
          api_password => 'sekrit',
      );

      my $newjob = $cron->create_cron(
          name => 'Daily clean up job',
          url => 'http://example.com/blahblah/?cleanup=1',
          schedule => '46 0 * * *',
      );

      my $jobs = $cron->get_all_crons();

      foreach my $job ( $jobs ) {
          if ( $job->{'url'} =~ /deadhost.com/ ) {
              $cron->update_cron(
                id => $job->{'id'},
                url => $job->{'url'} =~ s/deadhost\.com/example\.com/r,
              );
          }
      }
  
      say "deleted" if ( $cron->delete_cron( id => $jobs->[0]->{'id'} ) );

    This is a Perl binding for the cron.io <http://cron.io> service. Cron is
    a Unix service which executes jobs on a periodic basis. The cron.io
    service contacts URLs using the same time period specification.

    At the moment, the only way to generate a username and password for the
    service is by making a call on the "create_user()" method. Email
    verification is required before the credentials are valid.

ATTRIBUTES
  api_username
    You must supply an "api_username" for every method except
    "create_user()". This can be done at object construction time, or later
    by calling the "api_username()" method.

  api_password
    You must supply an "api_password" for every method except
    "create_user()". This can be done at object construction time, or later
    by calling the "api_username()" method.

METHODS
  create_user()
    This method requires the following parameters: "email", "username",
    "password". This call will register a username/password with the
    service. Human intervention (in the form of an email verification) is
    required before your username/password are activated.

    Once these credentials are active, you must provide them to this binding
    to execute other methods.

    The return value is a string message provided by the API service (which
    evaluates to a true value in Perl.) This method dies on errors.

  get_all_crons()
    This method returns an arrayref containing hashes of all cron jobs for
    your username.

    Hashes will contain the following keys:

    *   "id"

        This is an internal ID used by the service to identify a specific
        cron job. It is a required parameter for most of the other methods.

    *   "name"

        This is the name you assigned to a specific job.

    *   "url"

        The URL to contact at the given schedule specification.

    *   "schedule"

        This is a standard Unix cron style specification. See cron
        <http://en.wikipedia.com/wiki/Cron> on Wikipedia for a verbose
        description of this format.

    It is possible this call will return a reference to an empty list.

  create_cron()
    This method creates a new job. Required parameters are "name", "url",
    "schedule".

    The return value is a hash of "id", plus the three params you provided.

  get_cron()
    This method retrieves a specific job by its "id". "id" is a required
    parameter for this method. The return value is a hash as described
    above.

  update_cron()
    This method changes values with jobs which already have ids. "id" is a
    required parameter. Optional parameters are any or all of "name", "url",
    and/or "schedule".

  delete_cron()
    This method removes a job from the service. "id" is a required
    parameter. On success, this method returns a true value. It dies on
    errors.

TESTING NOTE
    To execute the full test suite, you must set CRONIO_API_USERNAME and
    CRONIO_API_PASSWORD environment variables with valid credentials.
