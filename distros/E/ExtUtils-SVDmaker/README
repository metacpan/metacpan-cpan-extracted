NAME
    ExtUtils::SVDmaker - Create CPAN distributions

SYNOPSIS
     use ExtUtils::SVDmaker;

     $svd = new ExtUtils::SVDmaker( @options );
     $svd = new ExtUtils::SVDmaker( \%options );

     $svd->vmake( @targets, \%options ); 
     $svd->vmake( @targets ); 
     $svd->vmake( \%options  ); 

DESCRIPTION
    The "ExtUtils::SVDmaker" program module extends the Perl language (Perl
    is the system).

    The input to "ExtUtils::SVDmaker" is the __DATA__ section of Software
    Version Description (SVD) program module. The __DATA__ section must
    contain SVD forms text database in the DataPort::FileType::DataDB
    format.

    Use the "vmake.pl" (SVD make) cover script for ExtUtils::SVDmaker to
    process a SVD database module as follows:

      vmake -pm=Docs::Site_SVD::MySVDmodule

    The preferred location for SVD program modules is

     Docs::Site_SVD::

    The "ExtUtils::SVDmaker" module extends the automation of releasing a
    Perl distribution file as follows:

    *   The input data for the "ExtUtils::SVDmaker" module is a form
        database as the __DATA__ section of a SVD program module. The
        database is in the format of DataPort::FileType::FormDB. This is an
        efficient text database that is very close in format to hard copy
        forms and may be edited by text editors

    *   The "ExtUtils::SVDmaker" module compares the contents of the current
        release with the previous release and automatically updates the
        version and date for files that have changed

    *   "ExtUtils::SVDmaker" module generates a SVD program module POD from
        the form database data contained in the __DATA__ section of the SVD
        program module.

    *   "ExtUtils::SVDmaker" modulegenerates MANIFEST, README and
        Makefile.PL distribution files from the form database data

    *   "ExtUtils::SVDmaker" module builds the distribution *.tar.gz file
        using Perl code instead of starting tar and gzip process via a
        makefile build by MakeFile.PL. This greatly increases portability
        and performance.

    *   Runs the installation tests on the distribution files using the
        "Test::Harness" module directly. It does not build any makefile
        using the MakeFile.PL and starting a Test::Harness process via the
        makefile. This greatly increases portability and performance.

    The "ExtUtils::SVDmaker" module is one of the end user, functional
    interface modules for the US DOD STD2167A bundle.

    The top level modules that establish the functional interface of
    interest to the end user are the "Test::STDmaker" and
    "ExtUtils::SVDmaker" modules. The rest of the modules are design modules
    for the US DOD STD2167A bundle. They are broken out as separate modules
    because they may have uses outside of the US DOD STD2167A bundle.

    The Test::STDmaker module has a number of design modules not shown in
    the above dependency tree. See Test::STDmaker for more detail.

  SVD Program Module Format

    The input(s) for the "fgenerate" method are Softare Version Description
    (SVD) Program Modules (PM).

    A SVD PM consists of three sections as follows:

    Perl Code Section
        The code section contains the following Perl scalars: $VERSION,
        $DATE, and $FILE. The "ExtUtils::STDmaker" automatically generates
        this section.

    SVD POD Section (DOD Tailoring)
        The Software Version Description (SVD) Plain Old Documentation (POD)
        section is in a slightly tailored United States (US) Department of
        Defense (DOD) SVD Data Item Description (DID) format.

        The tailoring is that paragraph 2 of the SVD DID is renamed from
        "REFERENCE DOCUMENTS" to "SEE ALSO" and moved to the end. The
        content of paragraph, 1.2 System Overview, is changed to include a
        brief statement of the software features and capabilities. The
        system is always the same, the Perl language. This makes better use
        of this space.

        The "ExtUtils::SVDmaker" module automatically generates this
        section.

    SVD Form Database Section
        This section contains a SVD Form Database that the
        "ExtUtils::SVDmaker" module uses to generate the Perl code section
        and the SVD POD section.

  Assumed Directory Structure

    The directory structure assumed by the "ExtUtils::SVDmaker" module is as
    follows:

     $TOP_DIR -+- lib -- * -- $svd.pm
               |
               +- bin
               |
               +- $REPOSITORY_DIR -+- $DISTNAME-$PREVIOUS_VERSION -+- lib
                                   |                               +- bin
                                   |                               +- Makefile.PL
                                   |                               +- README
                                   |                               +- MANIFEST
                                   |
                                   +- $DISTNAME-$VERSION.tar.gz
                                      $DISTNAME-$VERSION.ppd
                                      $DISTNAME-$VERSION.html

     $RELEASE_DIR = File::Spec-catdir($TOPDIR, $REPOSITORY_DIR, $DISTNAME-$PREVIOUS_VERSION)

    When the $PREVIOUS_DISTNAME is different than the $DISTNAME, the
    directory structure is as follows:

     $TOP_DIR -+- lib -- * -- $svd.pm
               |
               +- bin
               |
               +- $REPOSITORY_DIR -+- $PREVIOUS_DISTNAME-$PREVIOUS_VERSION -+- lib
                                   |                                        +- bin
                                   |                                        +- Makefile.PL
                                   |                                        +- README
                                   |                                        +- MANIFEST
                                   |
                                   +- $DISTNAME-$VERSION -+- lib
                                   |                      +- bin
                                   |                      +- Makefile.PL
                                   |                      +- README
                                   |                      +- MANIFEST
                                   |
                                   +- $DISTNAME-$VERSION.tar.gz
                                      $DISTNAME-$VERSION.ppd
                                      $DISTNAME-$VERSION.html

     $RELEASE_DIR = File::Spec->catdir($TOPDIR, $REPOSITORY_DIR, $DISTNAME-$VERSION)

  SVD Form Database Fields

    The "ExtUtils::SVDmaker" module uses the DataPort::FileType::FormDB
    lenient format to access the data.

    This is a very compact database form. The fields are a merge of the data
    required by the United States (US) Department of Defense (DOD) SVD Data
    Item Description (DID) and the ExtUtils::MakeMaker module.

    The following are the database file fields:

    ABSTRACT field
        This field should be a one line description of the module. It Will
        be included in PPD file.

    AUTHOR field
        This field should contain the name (and email address) of package
        author(s). It is used in PPD (Perl Package Description) files for
        PPM (Perl Package Manager) and as the "prepared by" entry in the
        title page of the generated SVD module POD section.

    AUTO_REVISE field
        This is the list of files (excluding the generated files MANIFEST,
        Makefile.pl, README and the $SVD.pm) ($SVD is the program module
        name supplied with the -pm option which is usually
        Docs::Site_SVD::$DISTNAME_$VERSION, DISTNAME field VERSION field),
        that the ExtUtils::SVDmaker module will copy from the $TOP_DIR to
        the $RELEASE_DIR (See Assumed Directory Structure) and automatically
        update the $VERSION and $DATE variables in the $RELEASE_DIR file.

        The file specification may contain BSD globbing metacharaters such
        as the '*'.

        An example of a AUTO_REVISE field is

         lib/Test/STD/STDgen.pm
         t/Test/STDmaker/*
         lib/Test/Tech.pm => tlib/Test/Tech.pm

        The ExtUtils::SVDmaker assumes the files in the AUTO_REVISE field
        are be relative to the $TOP_DIR.

        Another features of the AUTO_REVISE field is that the files in the
        $RELEASE_DIR can be rename with a line such as the following:

          top_dir_relative_file  => release_dir_relative_file

        This is useful in arranging the test software in libraries in the
        distribution. The best place for a test library is the under the
        test script itself.

    CAPABILITIES field
        This field shall briefly state the purpose the software, its
        features and capabilities.

    CHANGE2CURRENT field
        This field is normally left blank. This field only comes into play
        when the previous and current distribution names are different. In
        this case the "ExtUtils::SVDmaker" module, after it has restored the
        previous release directory, will copy each file from the previous
        release directory to the current release directory.

        Before the copy, the "ExtUtils::SVDmaker" module evals for each
        restored file, the "CHANGE2CURRENT" field. The file name for the
        current release is contained in the variable $file. Thus, the Perl
        statements in the "CHANGE2CURRENT" field should be use to change the
        names of files from a previous release with different files names
        for the current release.

        For example, to moved the top level from "lib/SVD" to
        "lib/ExtUtils", use the following:

          return if $file =~ s=lib/SVD/SVDmaker.pm=lib/ExtUtils/SVDmaker.pm=;^

    CHANGES field
        This field should contain a list of all changes incorporated into
        the software version since the previous version. It may include a
        brief history of changes to other versions.

        This field should identify, as applicable, the problem reports,
        change proposals, and change notices associated with each change and
        the effects, if any, of each change on system operation and on
        interfaces with other hardware and software.

    CLASSIFICATION field
        This field should include security other restrictions on the
        handling of the software.

    COMPRESS field
        This field is the program for compression. Normally this will be
        "gzip".

    COMPRESS_SUFFIX field
        This field is the default suffix for compressed files. Normally this
        is '.gz'.

    CSS field
        The Casscading Style Sheet (css) file for the readme html. Normally
        this is "help.css".

    DISTNAME field
        This is the name for distributing the package (by tar file). For
        library modules, this should be the package name with the '::'
        characters replaced with the '-' character.

    DOCUMENT_OVERVIEW field
        This field should summarize the purpose and contents of this
        document and shall describe any security or privacy considerations
        associated with its use.

    END_USER field
        This field is the "prepare for" entry in the title page of the
        generated SVD module POD section.

    FREEZE field
        Normally this field will be set to 0 in order to make dry-runs of
        the distribution. When set to 0, the version of the master library
        will not be changed. Set this field to 1 for the finalized
        distribution. The version number for any master library module that
        changed since the last distribution will be updated.

    HTML field
        This field is for HTML code at the end of the SVD POD section. For
        example,

         <hr>
         <p><br>
         <!-- BLK ID="NOTICE" -->
         <!-- /BLK -->
         <p><br>
         <!-- BLK ID="OPT-IN" -->
         <!-- /BLK -->
         <p><br>
         <!-- BLK ID="LOG_CGI" -->
         <!-- /BLK -->

    INSTALLATION field
        This field should include the following information:

        *   Instructions for installing the software version.

        *   Identification of other changes that have to be installed for
            this version to be used, including site-unique adaptation data
            not included in the software version

        *   Security, privacy, or safety precautions relevant to the
            installation

    LICENSE field
        This field should contain any restrictions regarding duplication and
        license provisions. Any copyright notice should also be included in
        this field.

    NOTES field
        This field should contain any general information that aids in
        understanding this document (e.g., background information, glossary,
        rationale). This field shall include an alphabetical listing of all
        acronyms, abbreviations, and their meanings as used in this document
        and a list of any terms and definitions needed to understand this
        document.

    PREREQ_PM field
        This field contains the names of modules that need to be available
        to run this extension (e.g. Fcntl for SDBM_File) followed by the
        desired version is the value. This field should use Perl array
        notation. For examples:

         'Fcntl' => '0',
         'Test::Tech' => '1.09',

        If the required version number is 0, any installed version is
        acceptable.

    PREVIOUS_DISTNAME field
        This field is normally left blank. Supply this field when the
        previous distribution name is different.

    PREVIOUS_RELEASE field
        This field is the version of the previous release.

    PROBLEMS field
        This field should identify any possible problems or known errors
        with the software version at the time of release, any steps being
        taken to resolve the problems or errors, and instructions (either
        directly or by reference) for recognizing, avoiding, correcting, or
        otherwise handling each one. The information presented shall be
        appropriate to the intended recipient of the SVD (for example, a
        user agency may need advice on avoiding errors, a support agency on
        correcting them).

    REPLACE field
        This is the list of files that the ExtUtils::SVDmaker module will
        copy from the $TOP_DIR to the $RELEASE_DIR entact without revising
        the $VERSION and $DATE variables. This is useful for say files used
        as expected files in a test where the $VERSION and $DATE variables
        should not be changed.

        The file specification may contain BSD globbing metacharaters such
        as the '*'.

        An example of a REPLACE field is

         t/ExtUtils/SVDmaker/expected/*

        The ExtUtils::SVDmaker assumes the files in the REPLACE field are be
        relative to the $TOP_DIR.

        Another features of the REPLACE field is that the files in the
        $RELEASE_DIR can be rename with a line such as the following:

          top_dir_relative_file  => release_dir_relative_file

    REPOSITORY field
        This field is the repositories that the current distribution will be
        released.

        For example,

         http://www.softwarediamonds/packages/
         http://www.perl.com/CPAN-local/authors/id/S/SO/SOFTDIA/

    REPOSITORY_DIR field
        The value for the REPOSITORY_DIR is normally "packages". This is the
        directory where all release files are found. The
        "ExtUtils::SVDmaker" module uses the REPOSITORY_DIR as follows:

        *   First it locates the $TOP_DIR of the package specified by the
            -pm option.

        *   It locates the repository directory by using REPOSITORY_DIR
            field as a sub directory of the $TOP_DIR.

        See Assumed Directory Structure

    RESTRUCTURE field
        This field is Perl statements that the "ExtUtils::SVDmaker" uses to
        rearrange the directory tree of the release directory.

        For example, to eliminate the "lib\SVD" subtree, enter the
        following:

         use File::Path;
         rmtree 'lib\SVD';

        The evaluation takes place after all "CHANGE2CURRENT" field
        processing and with the cwd the current release directory, not the
        previous release directory if they are different.

        See also CHANGE2CURRENT field;

    REVISION field
        Enter the revision for the STD POD. The revision field, in
        accordance with standard engineering drawing practices are letters A
        .. B AA .. ZZ except for the orginal revision which is -.

    SEE_ALSO field
        This field shall list the number, title, revision, and date of all
        referenced and related documents. This field shall also identify the
        source for all documents. A simple POD link, when applicable, will
        satisfy these requirements.

    SUPPORT field
        Point of contact to be consulted if there are problems or questions
        with the installation

    TITLE field
        This field is the "title" entry in the title page of the generated
        SVD module POD section.

    TEMPLATE field
        This is the template that the "$svd-"gen> method uses to generate
        the SVD POD file.

    TESTS field
        List of tests for determining whether the version has been installed
        properly and meets its requirements.

    VERSION field
        This field is the version of the release. The version should be a
        decimal number of the format "\d\.\d\d" starting with "0.01".

  targets

    For this discussion of the targets, the directory structure shown in the
    REPOSITORY_DIR field item applies.

    all target
        The all target executes the following target sequence:

         check_svd_db
         restore_previous
         auto_revise
         write_svd_pm
         makemake
         test
         tar
         gzip
         ppd

    auto_revise target
        This target uses the relative files specified in the AUTO_REVISE
        field. FOr each of the these files, $file, it will compare ($TOP_DIR
        $file) with ($RELEASE_DIR $file), scrubing any date and version so
        they are not compared.

        If the contents of ($TOP_DIR $file) is different than the
        ($RELEASE_DIR $file), this target will update the ($RELEASE_DIR
        $file) to the ($TOP_DIR $file) and appropriately change the version
        and date.

        The $TOP_DIR and $RELEASE_DIR used in this description is as
        established by REPOSITORY_DIR field item.

        Before performing the above sequence, this target will ensure that
        the following sequence of targets have been executed once

         check_svd_db
         restore_previous

    check_svd_db target
        This target checks the integrity of the SVD database and creates
        derived fields such as "TOP_DIR" helpful in processing other
        targets.

    clear target
        The following targets are executed only once no matter how many
        times they are specified. The target "clear" will clear the block
        and allow them to be executed again.

         check_svd_db
         restore_previous
         auto_revise
         write_svd_pm
         readme_html
         makemake

    dist target
        The dist target executes the following target sequence:

         check_svd_db
         restore_previous
         auto_revise
         write_svd_pm
         makemake
         tar

    gzip target
        The gzip target will compress the file

         $DISTNAME-$VERSION.tar

        (DISTNAME field VERSION field), in the directory

         $REPOSITORY_DIR

        After creating the compressed file

         $DISTNAME-$VERSION.tar.gz

        in the directory

         $REPOSITORY_DIR

        the gzip target will delete the "$DISTNAME-$VERSION.tar.gz" file.

        Before generating the "$DISTNAME-$VERSION.tar.gz" compress file, the
        gzip target will ensure that the following sequence targets have
        been executed once

         check_svd_db
         restore_previous
         auto_revise
         write_svd_pm
         makemake
         tar

    makemake target
        This target generates the following files:

         README
         MANIFEST
         Makefile.PL

        Before generating the above files, the makemake target will ensure
        that the following sequence targets have been executed once

         check_svd_db
         restore_previous
         auto_revise

    ppd target
        The ppd target will create the ppd file

         $DISTNAME-$VERSION.ppd
 
        that describes the distribution using XML in the directory

         $REPOSITORY_DIR

        Before generating the ppd file, the ppd target will ensure that the
        following sequence targets have been executed once

         check_svd_db
         restore_previous
         auto_revise

    readme_html target
        This target generates the file

         $DISTNAME-$VERSION.html

        in the directory

         $REPOSITORY_DIR

        The $REPOSITORY_DIR scalar used in this description is as
        established by REPOSITORY_DIR field item.

        Before generating the $DISTNAME-$VERSION.html files, the readme_html
        target will ensure that the following sequence targets have been
        executed once

         check_svd_db
         restore_previous
         auto_revise
         write_svd_pm

    restore_previous target
        Before generating the above files, this target will ensure that the
        following sequence targets have been executed once

         check_svd_db

    tar target
        The tar target will archive the files specified in the MANIFEST file
        into the file

         $DISTNAME-$VERSION.tar

        in the directory

         $REPOSITORY_DIR

        Before generating the $DISTNAME-$VERSION.tar archive file (DISTNAME
        field VERSION field), the tar target will ensure that the following
        sequence targets have been executed once

         check_svd_db
         restore_previous
         auto_revise
         write_svd_pm
         makemake

    test target
        The test target will run the tests specified in the TESTS field
        using the Test::Harness

        Before generating the above files, this target will ensure that the
        following sequence targets have been executed once

         check_svd_db
         restore_previous
         auto_revise

    write_svd_pm target
        This target generates the Perl and POD section of the SVD program
        module from the __DATA__ section. It updates both the copy in the
        $TOP_DIR subtree and the $RELEASE_DIR subtree.

        The $TOP_DIR and $RELEASE_DIR used in this description is as
        established by REPOSITORY_DIR field item.

        Before generating the above files, this target will ensure that the
        following sequence targets have been executed once

         check_svd_db
         restore_previous
         auto_revise

    # no target
        A lack of a target is the same as

         "all readme_html"

QUALITY ASSURANCE
    The modules "t::ExtUtils::SVDmaker::Original" and
    "t::ExtUtils::SVDmaker::Revise" are the Software Test Description(STD)
    programs modules for the "ExtUtils::SVDmaker". program module and
    package found in the distribution file for "ExtUtils::SVDmaker".

    To generate all the test output files, run the generated test script,
    and run the demonstration script, execute the following in any directory
    in any order:

     tmake.pl -verbose -demo -run -pm=t::ExtUtils::SVDmaker::Original
     tmake.pl -verbose -run -pm=t::ExtUtils::SVDmaker::Revise

    Note that tmake.pl must be in the execution path "$ENV{PATH}", the "t"
    directory on the same level as the "lib" that contains the
    "ExtUtils::SVDmaker" module, and the "Test::STDmaker" package must be
    present. The "tmake.pl" script is in the distribution file for
    Test::STDmaker.

    The "tmake.pl" script will create the "Original.t" and "Revise.t" test
    scripts and the "Original.d" and "Revise.d" demo scripts in the same
    directory as the program modules which may be individually ran by the
    "Perl" command.

    The Perl standard installation of the "ExtUtils::SVDmaker" will
    automatically run the test scripts "Original.t" and "Revise.t" generated
    by tmake.pl for the distribution file.

1.0 SCOPE
    This paragraph identifies and provides an overview of the released
    files.

  1.1 Identification

    This release, identified in 3.2, is a collection of Perl modules that
    extend the capabilities of the Perl language.

  1.2 System overview

    The system is the Perl programming language software. As established by
    the Perl referenced documents, the "ExtUtils::SVDmaker" program module
    extends the Perl language.

    The "ExtUtils::SVDmaker" module extends the automation of releasing a
    Perl distribution file as follows:

    *   The input data for the "ExtUtils::SVDmaker" module is a form
        database in the __DATA__ section of the SVD program module. The
        database is in the format of DataPort::FileType::FormDB. This is an
        efficient text database that is very close in format to hard copy
        forms and may be edited by text editors

    *   The "ExtUtils::SVDmaker" module compares the contents of the current
        release with the previous release and automatically updates the
        version and date for files that have changed

    *   "ExtUtils::SVDmaker" module generates a SVD program module POD from
        the form database data contained in the __DATA__ section of the SVD
        program module.

    *   "ExtUtils::SVDmaker" module generates the MANIFEST, README and
        Makefile.PL distribution files from the form database data

    *   "ExtUtils::SVDmaker" module builds the distribution *.tar.gz file
        using Perl code instead of starting tar and gzip process via a
        makefile build by MakeFile.PL. This greatly increases portability
        and performance.

    *   Runs the installation tests on the distribution files using the
        "Test::Harness" module directly. It does not build any makefile
        using the MakeFile.PL and starting a Test::Harness process via the
        makefile. This greatly increases portability and performance.

    The ExtUtils::SVDmaker module is one of the end user, functional
    interface modules for the US DOD STD2167A bundle. Two STD2167A bundle
    end user modules are as follows:

    Test::STDmaker module
        generates Test script, demo script and STD document POD from a text
        database in the Data::Port::FileTYpe::FormDB format.

    ExtUtils::SVDmaker module
        generates SVD document POD and distribution *.tar.gz file including
        a generated Makefile.PL README and MANIFEST file from a text
        database in the Data::Port::FileTYpe::FormDB format.

  1.3 Document overview.

    This document releases ExtUtils::SVDmaker version 0.10 providing
    description of the inventory, installation instructions and other
    information necessary to utilize and track this release.

3.0 VERSION DESCRIPTION
    All file specifications in this SVD use the Unix operating system file
    specification.

  3.3 Changes

    Changes are as follows:

    ExtUtils::SVDmaker-0.01
        Change the name from SVD::SVDmaker to ExtUtils::SVDmaker. The CPAN
        keepers have a no new top levels unless absolutely necessary policy.

        Added tests.

    ExtUtils::SVDmaker-0.02
        Drop tailing and starting white space for SEE_ALSO. Extra lines
        feeds was causing pod2hmtl to misbehave and not pick up on the links
        manpage.

        Fixed error in calculation of $formDB->{PM_File_Relative}

        Removed requirement for external Unix commands. Added code to
        replace the extenal Unix commands. The is no longer the need for
        nmake, make, tar, gzip, gunzip.

        Change the test so that test support program modules resides in
        distribution directory tlib directory instead of the lib directory.
        Because they are no longer in the lib directory, test support files
        will not be installed as a pre-condition for the test of this
        module. The test of this module will precede immediately. The test
        support files in the tlib directory will vanish after the
        installtion.

    ExtUtils::SVDmaker-0.03
        Fix some more problems due to Archive::Tar does tar correctly,
        (length of file contents does not match length in header) when use
        non Unix "\n"

    ExtUtils::SVDmaker-0.04
        Broke out the tar and gzip software into the modules
        Archive::TarGzip. Hopefully dealing with the Text '\n' problem by
        isolating and testing these functions separately. They also have
        high probability of being useful outside this module.

    ExtUtils::SVDmaker-0.05
        The lastest build of Test::STDmaker expects the test library in the
        same directory as the test script. Coordiated with the lastest
        Test::STDmaker by moving the test library from tlib to t/ExtUtils,
        the same directory as the test script and deleting the test library
        "File::TestPath" program module.

        Added addition code to the test target to isolate the program module
        under test. Before the test, the @INC directories are stipped back
        to the first one contain Perl. This is to isolate the test to only
        the virgin Perl distribution program modules. The test target then
        creates a require directory under the same directory as the test
        script and copies over all prequesite program modules to this
        directory. After the test target performs the test it restores @INC
        and removes the require directory tree.

        Hopefully this will eliminate many time consuming distributions
        failure due to using program modules that that are not part of the
        distributions.

        SWitch from "DataPort::Maker" to "File::Maker". Eliminated the use
        of "File::Data" and "File::TestPath"

    ExtUtils::SVDmaker-0.06
        Verbatim NAME section from template. Replaced.

    ExtUtils::SVDmaker-0.07
        Escape the SVD template POD '=' commands so that they do not confuse
        the CPAN to which is the real POD.

    ExtUtils::SVDmaker-0.08
        Fixed typo in the NAME section.

    ExtUtils::SVDmaker-0.09

        Analysis:

        Not using the lastest version of "Test::Scrub" which will wild card
        out "OS NAME"

        Corrective:

        Put lastest version in "ExtUtils::SVDmaker use", the "Makerfile.PL"
        prerequesite and also load the lastes in the test
        "t::Test::ExtUtils::SVDmaker" repository. (Quite a few times CPAN
        package does not handle prereuesites as expected)

  3.4 Adaptation data.

    This installation requires that the installation site has the Perl
    programming language installed. There are no other additional
    requirements or tailoring needed of configurations files, adaptation
    data or other software needed for this installation particular to any
    installation site.

  3.5 Related documents.

    There are no related documents needed for the installation and test of
    this release.

  3.6 Installation instructions.

    Instructions for installation, installation tests and installation
    support are as follows:

    Installation Instructions.
        To installed the release package, use the CPAN module pr PPM module
        in the Perl release or the INSTALL.PL script at the following web
        site:

         http://packages.SoftwareDiamonds.com

        Follow the instructions for the the chosen installation software.

        If all else fails, the file may be manually installed. Enter one of
        the following repositories in a web browser:

          http://www.softwarediamonds/packages/
          http://www.perl.com/CPAN/authors/id/S/SO/SOFTDIA/

        Right click on 'ExtUtils-SVDmaker-0.10.tar.gz' and download to a
        temporary installation directory. Enter the following where $make is
        'nmake' for microsoft windows; otherwise 'make'.

         gunzip ExtUtils-SVDmaker-0.10.tar.gz
         tar -xf ExtUtils-SVDmaker-0.10.tar
         perl Makefile.PL
         $make test
         $make install

        On Microsoft operating system, nmake, tar, and gunzip must be in the
        exeuction path. If tar and gunzip are not install, download and
        install unxutils from

         http://packages.softwarediamonds.com

        VERY IMPORTANT:

        The distribution package contains the cover "vmake.pl" perl command
        script. Manually copy this into the execution path in order to use
        "SVDmaker" from the command line. Rename it if there is a name
        conflict or just do not like the name.
