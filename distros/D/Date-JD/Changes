version 0.005; 2011-07-17

  * introduce new conversion functions *_to_*nn and *_to_*nf, which
    do the job of *_to_*n but without the annoying context-sensitive

  * skip Math::BigRat tests if Math::BigRat is of a version that doesn't
    work adequately

  * include META.json in distribution

  * add MYMETA.json to .cvsignore

version 0.004; 2010-07-29

  * use simpler "parent" pragma in place of "base"

  * check for required Perl version at runtime

  * use full stricture in test suite

  * in Build.PL, explicitly declare configure-time requirements

  * remove bogus "exit 0" from Build.PL

  * add MYMETA.yml to .cvsignore

version 0.003; 2009-03-22

  * list all conversion functions explicitly in the documentation

  * test POD syntax and coverage, and rename some internal functions to
    satisfy the coverage test

  * remove from .cvsignore items that don't occur with Module::Build

version 0.002; 2007-09-08

  * bugfix: in initialisation, override any ambient $SIG{__DIE__}
    handler when using eval { }

  * in documentation, use correct parameter name "...DN" for jdn_to_mjd()
    and similar functions

  * test explicitly for correct class of result

  * in documentation, more explicit definition of CJD in terms of JD

  * in documentation, note that the DJD epoch coincides with J1900.0
    only in Terrestrial Time

    systems

    specific "time of day" and "TOD"
