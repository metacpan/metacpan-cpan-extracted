 *   Simple text tokenizer (flex based)					   *
 *   Features:								   *
 *  	- parses text to tokens taking mind on quotes & escape characters  *
 *	- specialy developed for config files reading			   *
 *	- escaped quotes inside quotes are auto-unescaped (can be disabled)*
 *	- `' quotation strings optional support (as subtype of `` strings) *
 *	- DOS/UNIX/MAC end of lines support				   *
 *	- enhanced error reporting					   *
 *	- very fast ?-)							   *
 *	- internal line count (for multiple buffers)			   *
 *	- bash style comments (can be disabled)				   *
 *	- optional C/C++ style comments					   *
 *	- avaible one generic & one configurable interface for in-memory   *
 *		tokens storage						   *
 *	- bad call (segfault) prevention				   *
