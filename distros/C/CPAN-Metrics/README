NAME
    CPAN::Metrics - Create and maintain a Perl::Metrics database for all of
    CPAN

SYNOPSIS
      # Do a CPAN::Metrics run
      my $metrics = CPAN::Metrics->new(
          remote  => 'http://mirrors.kernel.org/cpan/',
          local   => '/home/adam/.minicpan',
          extract => '/home/adam/.cpanmetrics',
          metrics => '/home/adam/.cpanmetrics/metrics.sqlite',
      )->run;

DESCRIPTION
    "CPAN::Metrics" is a combination of CPAN::Mini and Perl::Metrics.

    It lets you pull out all of CPAN (for various definitions of "all") and
    run Perl::Metrics on it to generate massive amounts of metrics data on
    the 16,000,000 lines of code in CPAN.

  Resource Usage
    While it might make it relatively easy to write the code to "process all
    of CPAN", make no mistake that it's going to take you LOT of computing
    resources to do it. And especially so the first time.

    To do a single run should require 1-10 gigabytes of disk space, up to
    several hundred megabytes of memory, and hours (or days) of CPU time.

    The result will be a SQLite database containing somewhere between
    several hundred thousand and several million rows of metrics data.

    What you do with the metrics after that is up to you.

METHODS
new
    The "new" constructor creates a new CPAN metrics processor.

    Although it is created as an object, due to Perl::Metrics you can only
    create a single object within a single process. (I think)

    It takes a variety of different parameters.

    minicpan arguments

    Returns a new "CPAN::Metrics" object, or dies on error.

  run
    The "run" method launches the CPAN metrics processor. It will syncronize
    its minicpan mirror from the remote server, expanding any new archives,
    and removing old ones. Once updated, the directory will be reindexed at
    update it in the metricsdatabase, and any required processing done to
    add the resulting metrics needed.

    And then (a "very" long time later) it will stop. :)

    Oh, and return true. Any errors will cause an exception (i.e. die)

TO DO
    - Improve Perl::Metrics to add needed things

    - Improve CPAN::Metrics::Extract to add needed things

    - Improve CPAN::Metrics to add needed things

    - Get all three of the above to use accessors

    - Possibly consider intentionally disabling caching so that we don't end
    up with a multi-multi-gigabyte parse cache.
