Revision history for Perl extension TDB_File.

0.01  Tue Mar 26 17:02:46 2002
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.21 with options
	   -x -n TDB_File -p tdb_ /home/gus/projects/tdb-perl/tdb-perl/tdb.h

0.50  Sat Jun 29 15:29:20 2002
	- initial release to CPAN

0.90  Tue Jun 21 09:02:15 2005
	- Support a log callback for each TDB_File object
	- Pass logging function to tdb_open_ex()
	- Remove tdb_lockkeys/tdb_unlockkeys functions, since they
	  seem to have gone from TDB
	- Use ExtUtils::Constant to build constant() function

0.95  Tue Jun  5 00:12:02 2007
	- Makefile.PL now attempts to determine various tdb
	  differences.
	- tdb_open_ex with a hash_fn arg now generates a warning if
	  TDB_File was compiled against a tdb version that lacks this
	  argument.
	- Change tdb_printfreelist to return void, since the
	  sourceforge 1.0.6 version has this, and we don't care about
	  the return value in other versions.
	- Protect TDB_ERR_LOCK_TIMEOUT, since that constant doesn't
	  exist in some versions.

0.96  Tue Jun  5 00:14:02 2007
	- Fix memory leak in TDB_DATA typemap.  Thanks nigelw.

0.96a Mon Mar 17 21:36:52 2008
	- Remove bogus (and unused) stop() macro on freebsd.
