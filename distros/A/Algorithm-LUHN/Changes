0.13 2001-05-03 TAYERS

    - Changed is_valid to always return 1 or '' (instead of 0 or
      sometimes undef) and it sets $ERROR when the check_digit doesn't match.
    - Small change to the calculation of the return value of check_digit.
      Purely for aesthetic reasons.

0.12 2001-05-02 TAYERS

    - Replaced the ill-conceived C<die> call in check_digit with the
      $ERROR variable that contains the reason for the "failure."
