WWW::Crab::Client
=================

    This module implements a subset of the Crab protocol sufficient for
    reporting the status of a cron job to the Crab server. It is intended to
    work similarly to the Python Crab client module, but be more convient
    for cron jobs written in Perl.

    The Crab server and utilities are available from:
