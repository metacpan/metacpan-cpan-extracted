NAME
    RT-Extension-ActivityReports - Additional reports to show Activity in RT

DESCRIPTION
    The ActivityReports extension lets you see:

    *   Activity Detail

        A table of ticket status per queue, and totals.

    *   Activity Summary

        A one-line summary of all updates made.

    *   Resolution Comments

        Summary of when tickets were resolved, duration between creation and
        (latest) resolution.

    *   Resolution Statistics

        For each queue, average duration between creation and (latest)
        resolution over the last 30, 60, 90 days, and all time.

    *   Time Worked Statistics

        For each user, a table of every queue and how long that user has
        worked on tickets that have been resolved in a particular timeframe.
        For example, you can see how much time Joe has spent on Basic
        Support (queue) tickets that have been resolved the day after they
        were created.

    All of these reports can be filtered by actor, arbitrary search query,
    and/or between two dates, so it's quite flexible.
