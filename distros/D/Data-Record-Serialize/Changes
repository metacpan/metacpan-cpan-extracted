  [API CHANGE]

    * combined encoders and sinks must provide a close method.

  [ENHANCEMENT]

    * The Stream sink takes a 'create_output_dir' argument which, if true,
      will create the directory containing the output file.

1.07      2024-11-22 12:08:00-05:00 America/New_York

  [ENHANCEMENT]

    * new "array" encoder, which outputs the transformed data as a
      Perl arrayref.

1.06      2024-01-10 12:23:54-05:00 America/New_York

  [BUGFIX]

    * Encoders which need to output closing data can provide a
      'finalize' method which will be called before the sink's 'close'
      method is called.

1.05      2023-09-26 16:36:38-04:00 America/New_York

  [PACKAGING]

    * Data::Record::Serialize::Encode::dbi has been moved into its own distribution.

  [TESTS]

    * stream tests which perform compares on dumps
      need to perform CR/LF conversion on MS Windows systems.


1.01      2022-09-03 09:30:13-04:00 America/New_York

  [TESTS]

    * don't check for actual value of round-tripped JSON and YAML
      booleans, just if it's true/false.  SREZIC++.

    * fix Americanized spelling of Types::Serialiser::Boolean

1.00      2022-09-03 08:47:05-04:00 America/New_York

  [API CHANGE]

    * ::Sink:stream no longer takes an 'fh' parameter.  All output
      streams (including file handles) are specified via the 'output'
      parameter.

  [BUG FIX]

    * streams which write to a passed fh no longer close the fh

  [ENHANCEMENT]

    * Sink::stream functionality moved into Role::Sink::Stream so
      can be reused

    * streams now recognize more types of file handle objects

    * Data::Dumper sink
        * optimized to use a single DD object rather than creating one
          for each send operation
        * DD configuration variables can be specified
        * can use an existing DD object


0.34      2022-01-27 10:44:45-05:00 America/New_York


  [BUILD FIX]

   * bump required version of Test::TempDir::Tiny to at least 0.010 to
     resolve CPAN testers errors on in_tempdir on older version
     (++CHORNY)


0.33      2022-01-26 00:22:49-05:00 America/New_York (TRIAL RELEASE)

  [BUG FIX]

   * If an incompatible Cpanel::JSON::XS < 3.0236 was installed, its
     version of JSON::PP::Boolean was used, rather than the real
     JSON:PP::Boolean.  (++SREZIC for the report RT#139460)

0.32      2021-09-13 18:14:20-04:00 America/New_York

  [BUILD FIX]

   * add missing test dependency on Test::TempDir::Tiny. ++SREZIC

  [BUG FIX]

    * previous fix in 0.29 was incomplete


0.29      2021-09-01 18:09:05-04:00 America/New_York

  [BUG FIX]

   * stream sink didn't properly guard against double closes

0.28      2021-08-09 20:42:48-04:00 America/New_York

  [BUILD FIX]

   * JSON::MaybeXS is no longer used to find the JSON backend, as it
     does not allow a minimum version to be specified.

   * Tests for optional encoders (YAML, JSON, DBI) now will be skipped
     if required versions of their backends are not avaliable.
     Because the encoders are optional, they appear as runtime
     recommendations in META.json, which is not sufficient to cause
     installed versions to be upgraded to the required versions..


  [BUG FIX]

   * automatic numify/stringify/nullify field determination croaked if
     output fields were a subset of the types given.

   * the YAML, JSON, and DBI encoders now check at runtime that the
     required versions of their backends are available.


0.27      2021-08-07 14:10:27-04:00 America/New_York (TRIAL RELEASE)

    * add reporting for backends for JSON::MaybeXS

0.25      2021-08-06 11:29:25-04:00 America/New_York

  [BUILD FIX]

    * test requires Exporter::Tiny >= 1.002 to export scalars

    * incorrect dependency on YAML::Any; only YAML::PP and YAML::XS are
      supported

0.24      2021-07-30 23:35:07-04:00 America/New_York

  [API BREAKAGE]

    * the consistency of the return values of the types, output_types, and fields methods was
      inconsistent. they're now consistent, and different.

    * type_index now returns an arrayref; it will probably change further, so use with caution.

  [ENHANCEMENTS]

    * booleans are now supported
    * json and yaml properly support booleans and string/number differentiation.
    * dbi supports booleans
    * new sink, array.
    * alternate namespaces for Sink and Encoders now possible
    * dbi connections may be opened in cached mode

  [BUG FIX]

    * duplicate output fields now cause an exception to be thrown

0.19      2020-04-15 11:17:27-04:00 America/New_York

  [ENHANCEMENTS]

    * formats may now be coderef's as well as sprintf format strings


0.18      2018-04-11 15:01:27-04:00 America/New_York

  [BUILD FIX]

    * Need Moo >= 2.003001 to get fix to RT#120000

0.17      2018-04-11 15:01:27-04:00 America/New_York

  [BUG FIX]

    * need parens for certain expressions in Perl <= 5.12.5 because of
      bug in precedence for prototyped functions (see perl5140delta).


0.16      2018-03-30 09:58:26-04:00 America/New_York

  [BUILD FIX]

    * used Types::Standard's CycleTuple type, which requires a newer
      Types::Standard than was indicated


0.15      2018-03-28 15:00:21-04:00 America/New_York

  [BEHAVIOR CHANGE]

    * the dbi backend now translates empty numeric fields into
      NULL fields.

  [ENHANCEMENT]

    * empty fields may now optionally be turned into NULL values.
      see the <nullify> attribute.


    * new method <type_index>, returns fields with a given type


0.14      2018-03-21 13:03:45-04:00 America/New_York

  [API CHANGE]

    * dbi encoder:

      * The encoder no longer writes queued records at object
        destruction.  If there is an error writing a record to the
        database, an exception is raised. However, during object
        destruction Perl effectively ignores exceptions, suppressing
        notification of the failed writes.

      * if the record queue is not empty at the time of object destruction,
        a warning is issued.

  [ENHANCEMENT]

    * dbi encoder:

        * the encoder provides the <flush> method, which explicitly writes
          queued records to the database.

        * The record queue is available via the <queue> method.


0.13      2018-02-12 15:59:58-05:00 America/New_York

  [BUG FIX]

    * the rdb encoder warned if a field was undefined. it's now quiet.
    * the Data::Dumper encoder didn't output eval'able code when
      multiple records were written.

  [ ENHANCEMENTS ]

    * update docs for JSON encoder to indicate that it is a
      stream of conactenated objects, and needs to be read
      with an incremental parser.


0.12      2017-06-15 15:43:52-04:00 America/New_York

  [BUILD]
    * require a recent version of Moo::Role to ensure that testers

0.11      2017-05-09 10:41:54-04:00 America/New_York (TRIAL RELEASE)

 [ENHANCEMENT]

   * new close() method, causes output to sink to be flushed and
     the sink to be closed.

   * dbi encoder: more robust when destroyed during global destruction

 [ BUILD FIX ]

   * specify required version of Types::Standard

0.10      2017-04-28 16:55:38-04:00 America/New_York (TRIAL RELEASE)

     deleted

      instead of homegrown code
