Padre::Plugin::InstallPARDist

A plugin for Padre to install PAR archives into
a local installation of perl from within the editor.

Installation should be done with the standard installation tools
CPAN.pm or CPANPLUS

Install Padre
Install LWP
Install ExtUtils::InferConfig
Install PAR::Dist
Install Padre::Plugin::InstallPARDist

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
If you decide to install the plugin manually, you can do the following
instead of installing the module into a normal Perl library path:

- Install the prerequisite modules.

- Run:

perl Build.PL
./Build

- To install the plugin as a single binary for the current user, run:

./Build installplugin

This will install the plugin as InstallPARDist.par into your user's ~/.padre/plugins
directory.

Similarly, "./Build plugin" will just create the InstallPARDist.par which you can
then copy manually.
