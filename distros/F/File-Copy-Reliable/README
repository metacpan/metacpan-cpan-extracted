NAME
    File::Copy::Reliable - file copying and moving with extra checking

SYNOPSIS
      use File::Copy::Reliable;
      copy_reliable( $source, $destination );
      move_reliable( $source, $destination );

DESCRIPTION
    File::Copy is an excellent module which handles copying and moving
    files. File::Copy::Reliable provides an extra level of checking after
    the copy or move. This might be useful if you are copying or moving to
    unreliable network fileservers.

    At the moment this checks that the file size of the copied or moved file
    is the same as the source.

    The exported functions throw exceptions if there was an error.
