Revision history for Perl extension Pod-Weaver-Plugin-EnsureUniqueSections

    - Fixed order-dependence in weaver.ini: Previously it was possible
      that plugins (specifically plugins doing the
      Pod::Weaver::Role::Finalizer role) could add more sections after
      EnsureUniqueSections had finished its checking. Obviously, such
      sections were not checked for duplicates. Unfortunately, the
      Leftovers plugin was liable to do this, and was also the most
      likely source of duplicate sections. Now [-EnsureUniqueSections]
      can be anywhere in weaver.ini and it should have the same
      effect. ( https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=77526 )
    - Added a test suite.
    - Switched to using the logger for error messages instead of using
      "croak"
