NAME

    JSON::RPC2 - Transport-independent implementation of JSON-RPC 2.0

VERSION

    This document describes JSON::RPC2 version v2.1.2

SYNOPSIS

    See JSON::RPC2::Server and JSON::RPC2::Client for usage examples.

DESCRIPTION

    This module implement JSON-RPC 2.0 protocol in transport-independent
    way. It was very surprising for me to find on CPAN a lot of
    transport-dependent implementations of (by nature)
    transport-independent protocol!

    Also it support non-blocking client remote procedure call and both
    blocking and non-blocking server method execution. This can be very
    useful in case server methods will need to do some RPC or other slow
    things like network I/O, which can be done in parallel with executing
    other server methods in any event-based environment.

INTERFACE

    See JSON::RPC2::Server and JSON::RPC2::Client for details.

RATIONALE

    There a lot of other RPC modules on CPAN, most of them has features
    doesn't provided by this module, but they either too complex and
    bloated or lack some features I need.

    RPC::Lite

      Not transport-independent.

    RPC::Simple

      Not transport-independent. Do eval() of perl code received from
      remote server.

    RPC::Async

      Not transport-independent. Not event-loop-independent.

    JSON::RPC

    RPC::JSON

    RPC::Object

    Event::RPC

    RPC::Serialized

    XML::RPC

    RPC::XML

      Not transport-independent. Blocking on remote function call.

    JSON::RPC::Common

      In theory it's doing everything... but I failed to find out how to
      use it (current version is 0.05) - probably it's incomplete yet. Even
      now it's too complex and bloated for me, I prefer small and simple
      solutions.
