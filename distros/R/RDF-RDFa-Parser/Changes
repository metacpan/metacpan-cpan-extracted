   simple error (reported via error callbacks, etc) rather than croaking.
 - ERR_CODE_CURIE_UNDEFINED is now a warning, not an error.

   from RDFa 1.1 test suite.

1.096_02  2012-05-17  # RDFa 1.1 Release Candidate 6.02

 - (Addition) XHTML5 is now a host language in its own right - a mashup
   between HTML5 and XHTML1, but with added xml:base support.

   it shouldn't have been.

1.094  2011-02-09  # RDFa 1.1 Release Candidate 4

 - (Addition) Include 'tagsoup' configuration set for dealing with content
   from the wild.

   Protocol namespace for better backcompat.

   information.
 - (Addition) Support @longdesc - not part of RDFa, but often provides
   useful information.
 - (Bugfix) Fix failure parsing embedded RDF/XML with blank nodes.
 - (Bugfix) new_from_url didn't work when called without a Config object.
 - @graph is now parsed like @about by default.
 - Change cache directory.

   RDFa 1.0 default prefix versus 'no prefix'). This involved renaming a
   couple of configuration options: prefix_default => vocab_default;
   prefix_empty => prefix_default.
 - Deprecated pretriple_literal and pretriple_resource callbacks - use
   ontriple instead.
 - IETF link types now use an aggressively cached copy of
   http://www.iana.org/assignments/link-relations/link-relations.xml.
 - Improve HTTP caching behaviour.
 - Second parameter to ontriple callback is now a hashref of elements
   rather than just the current element - this change is to help support
   the RDFa API.

   instead of previously used internal identifier.

1.092  2010-10-20  # RDFa 1.1 Release Candidate 2

   regexp bug. Fixed.

   non-standard namespace, assume @graph is in that namespace too.
 - Load Profile modules via Module::Pluggable.
 - RDFa Profiles establish both a case-sensitive and case-insensitive term
   mapping.
 - Reimplement RDFa 1.0 keyword concept using profiles.
 - Strongly deprecate keyword_bundles config option - use default_profiles
   instead.
