Revision history for Class-Meta-Declare

0.03    2006-02-25
        - Support for non-built-in types.

0.02    2005-12-13
        - Defaults for all values listed in POD.
        - "code" slot for methods no longer mandatory.
        - The "values" in the constructors options are now array references
          instead of hash references.  This allows us to preserve the
          attribute order.
        - Doc improvements.
        - Specify alternate build class via meta.use.
        - Renamed 'attr' to 'acc' in a couple of sports where I missed it.

0.01    2005-12-09
        - Basic support for all planned functionality.
