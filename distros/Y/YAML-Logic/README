NAME
    YAML::Logic - Simple boolean logic in YAML

SYNOPSIS
        use YAML::Syck qw(Load);
        use YAML::Logic;

        my $logic = YAML::Logic->new();

          ### Tests defined somewhere in a YAML file ...
        my $data = Load(q{
          # is $var equal to "foo"?
        rule:
          - $var
          - foo
        });

          ### Tests performed in application code:
        if( $logic->evaluate( $data->{rule}, 
                              { var => "foo" }) ) {
            print "True!\n";
        }

DESCRIPTION
    YAML::Logic allows users to define simple boolean logic in a
    configuration file, without permitting them to run arbitrary code.

    While Perl code can be controlled with the "Safe" module, "Safe" can't
    prevent the user from defining infinite loops, exhausting all available
    memory or crashing the interpreter by exploiting well-known perl bugs.
    YAML::Logic isn't perfect in this regard either, but it makes it
    reasonably hard to define harmful code.

    The syntax for the boolean logic within a YAML file was inspired by John
    Siracusa's "Rose::DB::Object::QueryBuilder" module, which provides data
    structures to define logic that is then transformed into SQL.
    YAML::Logic takes the data structure instead and transforms it into Perl
    code.

    For example, the data structure to check whether a variable $var is
    equal to a value "foo", looks like this:

        [$var, "foo"]

    It's a reference to an array containing both the value of the variable
    and the value to compare it with. In YAML, this looks like

        rule: 
          - $var
          - foo

    and this is exactly the syntax that YAML::Logic accepts. Note that after
    parsing the YAML configuration above, you need to pass *only* the array
    ref inside the "rule" entry to YAML::Logic's "evaluate()" method:

        $logic->evaluate( $yaml_data->{rule},  ...

    Passing the entire YAML data would cause an error with YAML::Logic, as
    it expects to receive an array ref.

  Variable Interpolation
    Note that variables like $var will be interpolated so that they'll
    represent their value before the evaluation starts.

    So if you have

        rule:
          - $var
          - foo

    and run

        my $data = YAML::Load( $yaml );
        my $rc = $logic->evaluate( $data->{rule}, { var => "bar" } );

    then YAML::Logic will substitute $var by the string "bar", and then run
    the test

        ["bar", "foo"]

    which checks if "bar" equals "foo". Since this is false, "evaluate"
    returns false.

    Variable interpolation happens on both sides of the comparison, so
    comparing

        rule: 
          - $foo
          - $bar

    will search for two variables, "foo" and "bar", replace the placeholders
    by the variable values and then compare the two entries.

    If a referenced variable is immediately followed by some text, you can
    also use Perl's "${foo}" notation to reference a variable:

        rule: 
          - ${foo}text
          - $bar

    Several comparisons can be combined by lining them up in the array. The
    lineup

        [$var1, "foo", $var2, "bar"]

    returns true if $var1 is equal to "foo" *and* $var2 is equal to "bar".
    In YAML::Logic syntax, these two ANDed comparisons are written as

        rule: 
          - $var1
          - foo
          - $var2
          - bar

    in a YAML file.

    Interpolation is done by the "Template Toolkit", so all the magic it
    does for arrays and hashes applies:

        rule:
          - $hash.somekey
          - foo

    with

        my $data = YAML::Load( $yaml );
        my $rc = $logic->evaluate( $data->{rule}, 
                                   { hash => { somekey => "foo" } } );

    will test if "foo" equals "foo" and hence return a true value.

    Likewise,

        rule:
          - $array.1
          - el2

    with

        my $data = YAML::Load( $yaml );
        my $rc = $logic->evaluate( $data->{rule}, 
                                   { array => [ 'el1', 'el2' ] } );

    will test if "el2" equals "el2" and return a true value. Check "perldoc
    Template" or read the O'Reilly Template Toolkit book for a more detailed
    explanation of Template's variable interpolation magic.

  Other Comparators
    Not only equality can be tested. In addition, these Perl operators are
    supported:

        eq 
        ne 
        lt 
        gt 
        < 
        <=
        > 
        >=
        == 
        !=
        =~ like

    The way to specify a different operator $op is to put it as key into a
    hash:

        [ $var, { $op, $value } ]

    So, the previous rule comparing $var to "foo" can be written as

        rule:
          - $var
          - eq: foo

    which is essentially running

        $var eq "foo"

    in Perl. To perform a numerical comparison, use the "==" operator,

        rule:
          - $var
          - ==: 123

    which runs a test of "$var == 123" instead.

  Regular Expressions
    Regular expression matching is supported as well, so to verify if $var
    matches the regular expression "/^foo/", use

        rule:
          - $var
          - like: "^foo"

    or

        rule:
          - $var1
          - =~: "^foo"

    Both are equivalent.

    Regular expressions are given without delimiters, e.g. if you want to
    match against /abc/, simply use

        rule:
          - '$var'
          - like: abc

    To add regex modifiers like "/i" or "/ms", use the "(?...)" syntax. The
    setting

        rule:
          - '$var'
          - like: (?i)abc

    will match like "$var =~ /abc/i".

  Logical NOT
    A logical NOT is expressed by putting an exclamation mark in front of
    the variable, so

        ["!$var1", "foo"]

    will return true if $var1 is NOT equal to "foo". The YAML notation is

        rule: 
          - "!$var1"
          - foo

    for this logical expression. Note that YAML requires putting a string
    starting with an exclatmation mark in quotes.

    By default, additional rules are chained up with a logical AND operator,
    so to check if a variable is not set to "foo" and not set to "bar", use:

        rule:
          - '!$var'
          - foo
          - '!$var'
          - bar

    And to verify that the variable matches neither /^foo.*/ nor /^bar.*/,
    use:

        rule:
            - '!$var'
            -
              - like: "^foo.*"
              - like: "^bar.*"

    Also note that "^foo.*" requires quotes in YAML.

  Logical OR
    To specify a rule that is satisfied if *any* of a series of tests
    succeeds, use the 'or' keyword in place of a variable:

        [ "or", [ $var, "foo", $var, "bar" ] ]

    This data structure indicates that the entire test is supposed to return
    true if either "$var eq "foo"" or "$var eq "bar"" holds true. It looks
    like this in YAML:

        rule: 
          - or
          -
            - $var
            - foo
            - $var
            - bar

    Pay close attention to the indentation: After the "- or" follows a line
    with a dash at the same indentation level, followed by a sub-array which
    has its elements indented to the next level.

  Logical AND
    By default, YAML::Logic chains up clauses by logical ANDs, i.e.

        rule:
          - $var1
          - foo
          - $var2
          - bar

    checks if $var1 is equal to "foo" *and* $var2 is equal to "bar".
    Alternatively, the "and" keyword can be used similar to the "or" keyword
    explained in the previous section:

        rule: 
          - and
          -
            - $var
            - foo
            - $var
            - bar

    With the above, you can't have variables named "and" or "or". If you do,
    use a hash key, as explained below.

  Defined-ness
    The Template Toolkit interpolates undefined variables as empty strings.
    But using TT's virtual methods, you can test if a variable is defined in
    the template context or not. The YAML logic

        rule: 
          - $var1.defined
          - 1

    will return true if $var1 has been defined. Conversely,

        rule: 
          - $var1.defined
          - ""

    will return true if the variable $var1 is *not* defined. Note that
    defined returns 1 on definedness and the empty string ("") if the
    variable is not defined.

  Logical Set Operations
    (not yet implemented)

        rule: 
          - $var1
          -
            - element1
            - element2

    (not yet implemented)

        rule: 
          - $var1
          - like:
              - element1
              - element2

YAML Traps
    The original YAML implementation has a number of nasty bugs (e.g.
    RT42015), so using YAML::Syck is recommended, which is a both faster and
    more reliable parser.

    Also, YAML as a configuration format can be tricky at times. For example
    if you type in

        my $data = Load(q{
          # is $var equal to "foo"?
        rule:
          - $var
          - foo
        });

    literally (like in the SYNOPSIS section of this document), keeping the
    indentation intact, YAML will complain that it's not happy about the
    final blank line, which contains whitespace characters:

        Code: YAML_PARSE_ERR_NO_FINAL_NEWLINE

    To avoid this, either use a YAML file, in which not using unnecessary
    indentation will feel natural. When using YAML strings, make sure
    there's no last line containing just whitespace, before feeding it to
    the YAML parser:

        my $yaml_string = q{
              # is $var equal to "foo"?
            rule:
              - $var
              - foo
        };
        $yaml_string =~ s/^\s+\Z//m;
        my $data = Load($yaml_string);

    Also, certain characters have a special meaning in YAML, so you can't
    write

        # WRONG
        rule:
          - $var
          - !blah!

    because YAML will parse that to

        [$var, undef]

    within the "rule" hash entry. Why? Lines starting with an exclamation
    mark are *tags* in YAML. To avoid getting tripped up by this, use
    quotes:

        # CORRECT
        rule:
          - $var
          - "!blah!"

    which correctly parses to

        [$var, "!blah!"]

    within the "rule" hash entry instead.

ERROR HANDLING
    If a rule fails, the error() method can be used to obtain a detailed
    textual description on why a comparison or a regex match failed.

        if( $logic->evaluate( $data->{rule}, 
                              { var => "foo" }) ) {
            print "True!\n";
        } else {
            print "Failed, reason is: ", $logic->error();
        }

    This will print something like

        Failed, reason is: Test ["foo" eq "bar"] returned []

    saying the when it compared "foo" to "bar", the result was the empty
    string (Perl's idea of 'false').

TROUBLESHOOTING
    Error Message: Unknown type: HASH(0x857d51c) at YAML/Logic.pm
        This means that you've fed a hash to YAML::Logic. For example, if
        your YAML file says

            rule:
              - "foo"
              - "bar"

        you've probably read the YAML file like

            my $data = LoadFile( $file );

        and now the data looks like

            { rule => ["foo", "bar"] }

        which, when you feed it unmodified to YAML::Logic as in

            $logic->evaluate( $data );

        presents the "rule" field to YAML::Logic, which it doesn't
        understand. Pass the content of the rule to YAML::Logic instead:

            $logic->evaluate( $data->{rule} );

        and it will work as expected.
