1.1 Wed Jun 28 17:31:15 EDT 2006 bwm
	* Updated DTD w/ several new features
	* Added code support for ranges; updated options on unsupported dtd element to match Spreadsheet::WriteExcel methods (See DTD)

	* Added margins (see DTD). Based on Spreadsheet::WriteExcel methods; note that for standard set_margins you need to set CDATA (<margins>5</margins>)
	* Added headers & footers, with margins for same (attributes of worksheet)
	* Added a worksheet attribute flag for landscape paper orientation (if set, landscape, else, portrait)
	* Added a paper type attribute on worksheet; set according to documentation for Spreadsheet::WriteExcel (or see comment notes in dtd) 
	* Added halign and valign to format; these allow usability of the two separate types as Spreadsheet::WriteExcel allows; if you set either of these, the align attribute is ignored. 
	* TODO: Update tests to represent new code. I have some test stuff that can be used.

1.02 Mon Sep 15 17:00:27 EDT 2003 wjb
        * Updated DTD w/ syntax rxp understands.
	* Removed 'name' attribute from worksheet (redundant to 'title')
	* Updated example XML document in test directory so that it validates
	  correctly against DTD.
	* Fixed bug where you could not declare 2 tags next to each other.
	  For example <row><cell>1</cell></row> wouldn't work.

1.01 Fri Aug 29 17:09:14 EDT 2003 wjb
	* Added parameter for large spreadsheets (>7Mb), this allows
	  FromXML to work with versions of OLE::Storage_Lite that do not
	  yet support IO::Scalar output.  This also means that until 
	  OLE::Storage_Lite is patched, FromXML will only support the 
	  production of 'smaller' XLS files.
        * Added data type functionality to rows & cells.
	  The following types are now supported:
	    - string
	    - number
	    - url
	    - formula
	    - blank
	  An invalid type will default to write_string.
	  Not defining a type will default to write_string.
        * Updated DTD
