NAME

    FFI::ExtractSymbols - Extract symbol names from a shared object or DLL

VERSION

    version 0.07

SYNOPSIS

     use FFI::ExtractSymbols;
     use FFI::CheckLib;
     
     my $libpath = find_lib( lib => 'foo' );
     
     extract_symbols($libpath,
       code => sub {
         print "found a function called $_[0]\n";
       },
     );

DESCRIPTION

    This module extracts the symbol names from a DLL or shared object. The
    method used depends on the platform.

FUNCTIONS

 extract_symbols

     extract_symbols($lib,
       export => sub { ... },
       code   => sub { ... },
       data   => sub { ... },
     );

    Extracts symbols from the dynamic library (DLL on Windows, shared
    library most other places) from the library and calls the given
    callbacks. Each callback is called once for each symbol that matches
    that type. Each callback gets two arguments. The first is the symbol
    name in a form that can be passed into FFI::Platypus#find_symbol,
    FFI::Platypus#function or FFI::Platypus#attach. The second is the exact
    symbol name as it was extracted from the DLL or shared library. On some
    platforms this will be prefixed by an underscore. Some tools, such as
    c++filt will require this version as input. Example:

     extract_symbols( 'libfoo.so',
       export => sub {
         my($symbol1, $symbol2) = @_;
         my $address   = $ffi->find_symbol($symbol1);
         my $demangled = `c++filt $symbol2`;
       },
     );

    export

      All exported symbols, both code and data.

    code

      All symbols in the "text" section of the DLL or shared object. These
      are usually functions.

    data

      All symbols in the data section of the DLL or shared object.

CAVEATS

    This module may work on static libraries and object files for some
    platforms, but that usage is unsupported and may not be portable.

    On windows, depending on the implementation available, this module may
    not differentiate between code and data symbols. In that case the
    export and code callbacks will be called for both.

    On many platforms extra symbols get lumped into DLLs and shared object
    files so you should account for and ignore getting unexpected symbols
    that you probably don't care about.

SEE ALSO

      Module for checking for the availability of dynamic libraries.

    Parse::nm

      This module can parse the symbol names out of shared object files on
      platforms where nm works on those types of files.

      It does not work for Windows DLL files. It also depends on
      Regexp::Assemble which appears to be unmaintained.
