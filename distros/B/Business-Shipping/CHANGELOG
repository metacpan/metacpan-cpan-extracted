Revision history for Business::Shipping. See github changelog for more details.
=======================================

3.1.0  March 6, 2011


    * Switched to CHI to replace outdated Cache::FileCache [JT Smith].
    * Added cache_config to RateRequest and Tracking so the developer can make
      use of any of the CHI drivers. [JT Smith]
    * Fixed failing test for 'Airmail Parcel Post' in 
      210-USPS_Online-basic.t [JT Smith].


3.0.1  March 6, 2011


    * Fix CPAN build failures caused by missing Config::IniFiles dependancy.
    * Misc docs and test updates.
    * Minor logging changes.


3.0.0  February 12, 2011


    * 2.4.1 is less than 2.03 -- bumping to 3.0.0.
    * 2.4.1 is also less than the sub-module versions (e.g. 338). Bump those
      to 400.


2.4.1  February 12, 2011


    * Add $VERSION back into sub-modules. PAUSE doesn't like it when you
      remove them.


2.4.0  February 12, 2011


  General

    * Change from Moose to Any::Moose
      - This allows for the Mouse module which has far fewer dependencies, 
        starts up faster, and has a lower memory footprint.

    * Fix UPS bug in shipping to United Kingdom. CountryCode was always being 
      set to 'UK', when UPS needs their 'GB' value.

    * Apply perl coding style.

  Backwards-Compatiblity:
  
    * Remove $VERSION from all the modules except Business::Shipping.
      I don't think the benefit of sub-module-specific versions is significant.

    * Use #!/usr/bin/env perl as the shebang for UPS surcharge update script. 
      It provides wider compatibility and doesn't assume where the current
      environment's perl is going to be.

  USPS_Online

    * Document new International USPS service types.
    
    * Reformatting, debug-logging changes, remove unused code.
    
    * Remove asterisks and "trademark" symbols in addition to "registered"
      symbols.
    
    * Remove the never-quite-worked-right "find service by matching package 
      type" code. It was trying too hard to be helpful and will more often than 
      not just cover up the real problem -- that it can't find the service type 
      by the normal method.
    
    * Reversed the polarity to fix bug in USPS service check: Check current
      against desired instead of the other way around (which was often overzealous
      in matching).
      
  UPS_Offline
  
    * Fix UPS fuel surcharge update script by updating regex [Josh Lavin].


2.2.1 Limited beta release


  General
  
    * [Fixed] You are overwriting a locally defined method (to_zip) with an 
      accessor.
    
    * [Fixed] USPS not matching service descriptions.
      This resolves the "Nested quantifiers in regex" error. Patches were sent
      in by Mark Milhollan and Kevin D. McClellan. Thank you!

    * Remove redundant 'Business.Shipping' from logging layout and fix logging
      messages with the wrong caller (due to off-by-one error in call frame 
      depth).


2.2.0 Limited beta release


  General
    
    * Upgraded from Class::MethodMaker to Moose.
    
    * Faster, simpler logging wrapper for Log4perl.
    
    * New version number scheme.
    
    * Many bug fixes, improvements, and style changes.

    * Changed from Subversion to Git.

  Backwards-Compatiblity:
  
    * New required module: Moose.
    
    * Minor API changes:
      - log_level() and log4perl.conf now use standard levels (not custom).
      - event_handlers() removed. This debug code was deprecated as of 1.06.
      - $rate_request->packages() returns arrayref of Package objects.


2.05 Limited beta release  


  Upgrade Notes
  
    * Clear the cache (typically /tmp/FileCache).

  USPS_Online
  
    * Change to protocol V3, with backwards-compatibility for version-2 
      responses. 
    
    * Document new International sevice names:
        Global Express Guaranteed
        Express Mail International (EMS)
        Express Mail International (EMS) Flat Rate Envelope
        Priority Mail International
        Priority Mail International Flat Rate Box
        Priority Mail International Flat Rate Envelope
        First Class Mail International
        	
    * Perl style changes
    
    * Improve error reporting in tests. Disable protocol V2 tests now that V3
      is in use. Update the letter service test.
      
    * Fix several occurences of: Use of uninitialized value in concatenation (.)
      or string at .../lib/site_perl/5.8.8/XML/DOM.pm line 483. There are 
      several more that need to be fixed.
      
  UPS_Online
  
    * Disable a few tests until they can be fixed.
    
  Interchange UserTag
  
    * New feature to display all shipping options with prices at once.
      - Templatable for <select> list or any other design.
      - Store prices in $Session->{shipping}{$nickname} (where nickname is, 
        for example, UPS_GNDRES, UPS_1DA, USPS_PRIORITY, USPS_EXPRESS, etc.). 
      - Tests for the new feature.
    
    * Refactor error handling and other components.


2.04  Limited beta release


  USPS_Online and UPS_Online changes by Rusty Conover <rconover@infogears.com>:

    * Rename tracking modules so they match the path, 
      Business::Shipping::UPS_Online::Tracking and Business::Shipping::USPS_Online::Tracking.

    * Fix tracking so it works with multiple tracking its, Class::MethodMaker 2.0 
      is a little tricky about this, you can't pass an arrayref on the init for 
      the tracking object, you need to pass it in a second call.  Update example code.

    * Fix caching for tracking so it actually works, rather then failing with an error 
      on Class::MethodMaker 2.x.

    * Fix caching for tracking so it doesn't overwrite cached versions of results on 
      every retrieval, causing the cache entries to never expire.

    * Cleanup date parsing code in Business::Shipping::USPS_Online::Tracking and to 
      no longer need Clone.
  
  USPS_Online changes by Mike Wexler <mwexler@tias.com>:
  
    * Fix error messages on International requests.
    
    * Add option to disable automatic package splitting.
    
    * Add width, height, length, and girth.
     
  General
  
    * [Fixed] Change GNU-style long-name command line arguments to more widely-
      compatible one-letter arguments. Reported by Todd Anderson 
      <ahqmed@hotmail.com>.
      
    * Removed some unused code.
    
    * Fix fuel surcharge updater. Contributed by Ron Phipps <ron@endpoint.com>.



2.03  Dec 31 2005


  USPS_Online
  
    * Fix weight calculation error and support shipments less than one pound.
      Patch by Mike Wexler <mwexler@tias.com>.
  
  
2.02  Dec 22 2005


  General
  
    * Default logging configuration is now to suppress everything except fatal 
      errors.

  UPS_Offline
  
    * [Fixed] Fuel surcharge update script mis-records dates.
    
    * Add support for tiered hundredweight pricing.
      - Tier 3 for Ground setup.
      - If data is not available, fall back to non-tiered pricing.
      - Tests.
    
    * Increase the number-of-packages limit, which increases the maximum weight.
    
    * Could not find data error now reports current working directory to help
      find the problem.


2.01  Sep 16 2005


  UPS_Offline
  
    * [Fixed] Many originating zip codes broken
      - Buggy "find nearby zone files" code.

    * Fuel surcharge enhancements
      - Major rewrite of update script.
      - Update script now stores effective date.
      - Calculation now occurs only once at load time.
      - Automatically use the "effective" rate if applicable. 
      - New code is backwards-compatible with old rate files, and new rate files
        are backwards-compatible with old code.

  Misc
  
    * Minor POD fix.  Found by CPAN Tester Josts Smokehouse 
      <Jost.Krieger+smokeback[at]ruhr-uni-bochum.de>.

    * Remove old tests.
    
    * Remove dependancy on Scalar::Util

  UPS_Offline
  
    * Fix Delivery Area Surcharge for zip codes over 46000.
      - Caused by truncated data table.
      
    * Use a binary search for the Delivery Area Surcharge for speed.

    * Fix Residential surcharge (differential).
      - Only apply to the correct services
      - Do not apply twice for Ground Residential.
      
    * Add a residential indicator to the automatic tests.
    
    * Fix incorrect usage of gndres/gndcomm for hundredweight.
    
    * Make residential differential configurable in config.ini
    
    * New method for determining if a shipment is via ground or air.
  

1.92  Aug 03 2005


  General
  
    * We need a little more testing before we bump the version to 2.0, 1.91 was
      not released.
      
    * Replace the ClassAttribs/ClassInfo system with a simpler one. 
      - This resolves the incompatibility with mod_perl and other frameworks,
        since we no longer 'use' ficticious and non-existant modules.
      - The cache feature should be thoroughly tested with the new code.
      - The cache will no longer distinguish between multi-package shipments,
        therefore, multipackage shipments disable the cache.
      - Two new tests.
      - Can remove dependancy on Scalar::Util after this is complete (since
        we'll no longer need the 'blessed' function).      
    
    * POD::Coverage tests did not have a plan.
    
    * Disable POD::Coverage unless the user *really* wants to run it.
    
    * Add current working directory to configuration error message.
    
    * Misc code clarity cleanups.
    
    * META cleanup.
    
    * Move doc/* files back into root so that CPAN will index them.  Too bad
      about the clutter.
  
  UPS_Online
    
    * Added signature_type, insured_value, and insured_currency_type.  Patch by
      Ed Zborowski <ed@rubensteintech.com> of the Rubenstein Technology Group.
    
  USPS_Online
  
    * Added 'all' service type to get all rates in one request.  Patch by
      Ed Zborowski <ed@rubensteintech.com> of the Rubenstein Technology Group.

  UPS_Offline
  
    * Fix major bug in zone finder.  
      - String equality functions shouldn't be used for numbers.
      - Zip codes like 850* should start working again.
      - Add a test for this zip code.
      
    * [Fixed] Fuel surcharge uses air rates for ground services.
      
    * Update fuel surcharge

    * New testing system: makes it easier to test lots of queries.
    
    * [Fixed] Some records are off by one
      - This was fixed in the data, but also required a minor change to the
        binary search algorithm to match the new data style.
    
    * [Fixed] Testing: The "close enough to correct value" detector is broken.
  
    * Test updates.
    
    * Fix 3 Day Select
    
    * Update copyright.
    
    * No delivery area surcharge for Hundredweight.
    
    * [Done] Delivery Area Surcharge: check xarea table instead of always 
      applying.
      - Requires DataFiles 1.00+
      - Uses new config.ini section: [ups_das]
    
  UserTag
  
    * Expose split-shipment max_weight functionality through new variable:
      BSHIPPING_MAX_WEIGHT.
      
    * [Tests] Slightly enhanced simulation of Interchange environment.
    
    * [Tests] Update to a more recent version of the usertag.
    
    * Documentation update.
    
    * Require 1.90 of Business::Shipping.
    
    * Additional error logging.

    
1.90  May 26 2005


  General
  
    * Support multiple packages
      - Done for UPS_Offline
      - Add test cases

    * [Enh] Split overweight shipments into multiple packages 
      - Instead of mulitple shipments.
      - UPS allows each *package* in a shipment to be a max of 150 lbs.
      - Divide overweight shipments into multiple virtual shipments
      - Max weight per virtual shipment customizable
      - Add test cases
      - $shipment->max_weight() can be used to customize the maximum package 
        weight for a given shipment. 
      
    * Moved a lot of files into doc/ so that the root directory would be a 
      little cleaner.
      
    * Default config/log/data directory changed to /usr/local/B_Shipping

    * [Fixed] Make test doesn't currently work because after installing 
      DataFiles, the data/ directory is in one place, and the config/ directory
      is in another.  However, the Config.pm module expects them all to be in 
      one location.
      - Solution: split out the directories so that they can be in separate 
        places.

    * Renamed go() to execute()

  UPS_Offline

    * [Enh] Major change: new data format for increased performance.
      - Instead of parsing UPS files at run-time, all the data is parsed into
        perl objects (like an in-memory database), and saved as Storable files. 
      - Significant performance increase and code simplification.
      - Reduces many required modules.
  
    * Add UPS Offline Hundredweight shipping
      - Use cwt tables
      - Requires overweight shipments to be split into multi-package, not
        multi-shipment.
      - Description of calculation:
        Calculate price for entire shipment weight altogether (not per-package).
      - Add a default safety padding.  If the weight is only x% higher than the
        required limit for hundredweight shipping, then do not calculate as 
	hundredweight (so that just in case the weights given to B::S are lower
	than actual billiable weight, the shipper wont be stuck paying 50% 
	higher fees).
      - Currently uses Storable::nstore for compatibilty.
      
    * [Fixed] .this_is_data did not make it into the release
      - Changed to this_is_the_data_dir

  UPS_Online
  
    * Disabled.  See doc/UPS_Online_disabled.txt
        

1.57  (Unreleased)


  General
  
    * All significant changes and bugfixes in this version were completed 
      by Rubenstein Technology Group:  
      - Ed Zborowski <ed@rubensteintech.com> 
      - Martin H. Beauchamp <martin@rubensteintech.com>
      - Jaron Rubenstein <jaron@rubensteintech.com>
    
    * [Fixed] Class::MethodMaker 2.05 now works
      - Different default_ctor() usage.
      - Caused this error: "failure to initialize object with parameters: 
        Odd number of arguments for new"
    
    * Changed how errors were handled.  Instead of just generating an 
      message and exiting, the code now saves the error info to the object,
      generates a message, and exits if the error was fatal enough.  More
      than one error message is now stored.
    
    * [Fixed] Business::Shipping::Shipment was trying to load a package 
      that did not exist.  
      - Changed the package class from 
        Business::Shipping::Shipment::<Shipper> to 
        Business::Shipping::<Shipper>::Shipment.
    
    * [Fixed] Business::Shipping::UPS_Online::RateRequest could not generate
      xml for more than one package.  
      - Stored the packages in the hash as an array.  XML::Simple then 
        converts the array into seperate Package elements.      
    
    * Store results using hash instead of a hash ref.

    * Tests updated for all new code.
    
  Tracking
  
    * Made a lot of bugfixes and changes to get the UPS and USPS Tracking 
      modules working.
      
  USPS_Online
  
    * Use version 2 of the protocol.
    
    * Changed USPS rate code so that it correctly parsed the response XML
      and created a similar results data structure that UPS rate code 
      creates.
    
    * Only pass machinable information if the user stated it.
    
    * Added shipper to foward array in RateRequest shipment method.

    * [Fixed] Priority service always flat rate options.
      - Caused by always passing 'container', which implies flat-rate.

  UPS_Offline

    * Fuel Surcharge updates  
    
  Usertag
  
    * Reduced some of the error messages 
    
    * Changed variable names from "BS" to "BSHIPPING".
  
      
1.56  Jan 03 2005


  General
  
    * [Fixed] Testing error in t/16_Pod-Coverage.t
    
    * [Enh] Minor documentation updates

  UPS_Offline
  
    * [Enh] 2005 Zones and Rates supported.
      - UPS changed the file format
      - See updated Business::Shipping::DataFiles
  
    * [Enh] Fuel surcharge auto-update
      - [Enh] Updated to work with new format introduced on 12/1/2004, which 
        now includes 2005 rates, and applies ground services as well as air.
      - [Fixed] Fuel surcharge auto-update bugs.
    
    * [Enh] Minor enhancements
      - [Enh] Preparation for the 2005 data.
      - [Enh] Data directory checks for ".this_is_data" file
      - [Enh] Check for missing columns while checking zone files
    
  Interchange Usertag
  
    * [Enh] Update usertag simulator test with recent usertag code.


1.55  Nov 22 2004

  General
  
    * Rewrite the 'service' parameter/function
      - User can specify full names such as 'Ground Residential' instead of
        GNDRES or 03.
      - Backwards-compatible
      - Allows easy retrieval of service names, codes, nicknames, etc.
      - Prepares the way for new UPS_Online 'Shop' service.
      
    * Rewrite the 'results' feature
      - Remove old 'packages' idea.
      - Make room for new UPS_Online 'Shop' service.
      - Not backwards-compatible, but results() was not intended to be public
        before.
    
    * Misc code cleanups
  
    * Remove some old utility functions.
    
    * [Fixed] Tests tried to load Cache::FileCache, even when the module was not 
      installed.  Now it tries to detect the module first.
    
    * [Fixed] Business::Shipping::RateRequest loaded Cache::FileCache even though
      it is not needed at that level anymore.
    
    * [Enh] Tests: check for username/password more consistently.
    
    * [Enh] Remove dependancy on updated version of Scalar::Util (now older 
      versions will work).
    
  UPS_Online
  
    * [Enh] New 'Shop' service.  Retrieve all the rates in one request.  Original 
      implementation by Selena Brewington <computers@chrisking.com>, later
      updated and modified. 
      - New tests added to cover the shop feature.
      - Example Usage:   
      
         my $rr_shop = Business::Shipping->rate_request( 
             service      => 'shop',    
             shipper      => 'UPS_Online',
             from_zip     => '98682',
             to_zip       => '98270',
             weight       => 5.00,
             user_id      => $ENV{ UPS_USER_ID },
             password     => $ENV{ UPS_PASSWORD },
             access_key   => $ENV{ UPS_ACCESS_KEY }
         );
         
         $rr_shop->go() or die $rr_shop->user_error();
         
         foreach my $shipper ( @$results ) {
             print "Shipper: $shipper->{name}\n\n";
             foreach my $rate ( @{ $shipper->{ rates } } ) {
                 print "  Service:  $rate->{name}\n";
                 print "  Charges:  $rate->{charges_formatted}\n";
                 print "  Delivery: $rate->{deliv_date_formatted}\n" 
                     if $rate->{ deliv_date_formatted };
                 print "\n";
             }
         }
    
    * [Enh] C.O.D. (Cash On Delivery) contributed by Selena Brewington
      <computers@chrisking.com>, with minor modifications.
      - To use, add these parameters to your rate request:
        
        cod            => 1,      # Enable C.O.D.
        cod_value      => 400.00, # C.O.D. value in USA dollars.
        cod_funds_code => 0,      # 0 = All funds allowed, 
	                          # 8 = money order only.

  UPS_Offline
  
    * [Enh] New program to update fuel surcharge automatically.
      - Run every first Monday of the month to get the new fuel surcharge
        from the UPS website.  
      - See bin/Business-Shipping-UPS_Offline-update-fuel-surcharge.pl for
        more information.
        
  Interchange UserTag
  
    * [Fixed] Several bugs and calling conventions.


1.54  Sep 21 2004


  General
    
    * [Enh] Major documentation updates and fixes
      - Added Test::Pod tests as well as Test::Pod::Coverage
      - Added POD for functions that lacked any.
    
    * [Enh] Major test updates
    
    * [Enh] Automatically detect which shippers can be supported based on the
      installed required modules.
      
    * [Enh] Skip tests that are for shippers that do not have their required
      modules installed.    
    
    * [Enh] Add "use_defaults=1" option to "perl Makefile.PL"
      - New options: -u=1 or --use_defaults=1: Use default values, do not ask 
        for values.
    
    * [Fixed] Business::Shipping requiring too many modules.  Switched to Basic.
    
    * [Fixed] Business::Shipping tests will fail if someone only installed
      Bundle::Business::Shipping::UPS_Offline, because the testing scripts
      will not notice.
      - New system checks to see if prerequisite modules were installed before
        testing functionality that depends on them. 


1.53  Sep 17 2004


  General
  
    * [Fixed] [Doc] Reference to logdie in Shipping.pm.
    
    * [Done] [Enh] Allow preloading of modules
      - New optional syntax: 
        use Business::Shipping { preload => 'All' };
        use Business::Shipping { preload => 'USPS_Online' };
      - Without preloading, some modules will be loaded at runtime.  Normally, 
        runtime loading is the best mode of operation.  However, there are some
        circumstances when preloading is advantagous (see docs).
        
    * [Enh] Split the data into its own distribution, and add it to the bundle.
      - Business::Shipping::DataFiles - Offline cost estimation tables
      - Benefits: 
        + Allows data to be updated separately from the code.
        + It changes less often
        + Update scripts can just do a CPAN install of the latest data module.
      - Issues:
        + Chicken and Egg problem.  Can't install data first, because it needs
          Business::Shipping to know where to install.  Can't install Shipping
          first because it needs data in order to test.  Solution:  Check for
          pre-installed Business::Shipping and use that as the default, but ask
          anyway (for both).
          
    * [Enh] Add Business::Shipping::DataTools 
      - Converts shipper files into a format usable by Business::Shipping.
      - Most methods were removed from UPS_Offline::RateRequest where they were
        languishing.
    
    * [Enh] [Aesthetic] Prefix some private methods with "_".
    
    * [Enh] [Aesthetic] Code cleanups.

    * [Done] [Enh] Allow usage of LWP through a proxy
      - Suggested by Mark <MpoloN7@netscape.net>.
      - Uses environment variables to set the proxy settings. E.g.:
        http_proxy=http://proxy.my.place/
        no_proxy="localhost,my.domain"
        export http_proxy no_proxy
        
    * [Done] [Enh] Provide multiple bundles (in the same distribution)
      - Bundle::Business::Shipping
      - Bundle::Business::Shipping::UPS_Offline
      - Bundle::Business::Shipping::etc.
  
  All Online Modules
  
      * [Done] [Enh] Migrate the "retry on failure" code from the interchange 
        usertag [business-shipping] to Business::Shipping proper.  Default to 
        tries = 2.
    
  Tracking
  
    * [Enh] More progress on upgrade of tracking modules to C:MM 2.0. 


1.52  Sep 14 2004 
  
  
  General
  
    * [Enh] Allow users to change the runtime logging level.
      New Business::Shipping->log_level() method can override the log4perl.conf
      logging level.
      
    * [Done] [Enh] Resurrect the event_handlers() method for backwards 
      compatibility.  Mapped to Business::Shipping->log_level().
      
    * [Done] [Enh] [Log4perl] replace die and warn with logdie and logwarn.
    
    * [Fixed] ClassInfo/ClassAttribs does not trap all exceptions.
      
  USPS_Online
  
    * [Fixed] Missing module bugs
      - List of errors:
        "Can't locate Business/Shipping/Package/USPS.pm in @INC"
        "Can't locate Business/Shipping/Shipment/USPS.pm in @INC"
      - Caused by module name restructure in 1.51.
      - Reported by Micah Gersten <micah@davka.com>.


1.51  Sep 10 2004  


  Compatibility
  
    * Module names have been restructured.  When using 
      Business::Shipping->rate_request(), use the new values for 'shipper':
      shipper => 'UPS_Online',
      shipper => 'USPS_Online',
      shipper => 'UPS_Offline',
      
  General
  
    * [Enh] Die if path to support files is missing files.
    
    * [Enh] Restructure all of the modules
      - Keep everything the same, except the "lowest level":
          "RateRequest::Online::UPS"   => "UPS_Online::RateRequest"
          "RateRequest::Offline::UPS"  => "UPS_Offline::RateRequest"
          "RateRequest::Online::USPS"  => "USPS_Online::RateRequest"
          "Tracking::UPS" => "UPS_Online::Tracking"
      - Benefits:
        All of the related code is in one directory.
        All of the abstract code is in neutral directories.
      - Note: This will totally break the ClassInfo/ClassAttribs system, because 
        that system just uses the names, instead of actually checking the 
        inheritance trees.
        
    * [Enh] Update the ClassInfo/ClassAttribs system to handle the restructured
      module system.  Should use ISA instead of breaking down the name 
      components.  
      
    * [Fixed] [Bug] For Micah Gersten <micah@davka.com>, Business.pm was 
      'require'd.

1.06  Feb 11 2004


  General
    - Remove Bundle::Business::Shipping (now in its own distro, where it should 
      be).
  
          
1.05  Feb 10 2004


  General
    - Attempted fix for Bundle::Business::Shipping
    - Remove unneeded .zip files from data/
    - Minor documentation updates
   
        
1.04  Feb 07 2004


    - Compatibility
        + Scalar::Util 1.10 is now required (to pretty up the code a little).
        + Getopt::Mixed now required for some scripts.
    
    - General
        + Created a Bundle::Business::Shipping module, uploaded to CPAN, and add
          to CVS (removed in 1.06).
        + New configuration parameter for this style:
          service=XDM    to_country=Brazil
          service=XDM    to_country=Canada       reason=Not available.
        + Scripts moved from doc/ to bin/
        + Some scripts re-named.
        + Rename some of the tests.
        + Devel::Required patch no longer necessary.  Recent version implement
          the desired functionality.
        + Class::MethodMaker patch no longer necessary.  Subclassing is 
          sufficient.
        + Remove zip files from distribution, they take up too much space.
        + Move some configuration methods from Shipping to Shipping::Config.

    - Offline::UPS
        + Major fix to the low/high number/name scheme.  For international, it 
          is now handled via split/rejoin, because the regex was choking on some
          of the country names.  This was causing many zip code combinations
          (that had lost their "high" in the last update), as well as some 
          countries, to fail.
        + Another fix for number range scheme.
        + Sense validity for several combinations of service and country/zip.
          (Ground Residential to Hawaii is now "invalid").
        + New test for the Netherlands.
        + Update to February fuel surcharge (5%)
        + New invalid request: Anything but express to israel.
        + New tests for Israel.

        + Add feature for not reporting "invalid" requests to the incident
          generator.
        + Pretty up the incident e-mail a little.

                
1.03  Jan 30 2004


    - Compatibility:
        - Math::BaseCnv now required (for Offline::UPS to Canada, to convert 
          their witty base-36 zip codes to the lowly decimal number system).
        - from_state required for Offline::UPS.
    
    - General updates:

          config.
        - France, Russia, and other countries fixed for Offline::UPS.
        - Fix "Multiple shipments to Canada return 0 except the first" bug, caused
          by poorly implemented Zones class attribute: now correctly implement as a
          static hash, accessed by function.
        - Minor fixes: Express Plus.
        - Offline::UPS now supports all services to Canada, which completes all of 
          the Offline::UPS countries.
        - New error message for XDM to Canada.
        - Removed regexp that was causing an extra field to be put in the data.
          (This fixed a lot of XDM shipments that weren't working before.)
        - Fixed: Some country/service type records were not returning errors 
          (e.g. Malaysia+XDM).
        - Fixed: CA (Canada) was matching AfriCA.

    - Tests:
      - Additional UPS Online/Offline tests: Canada, Mexico.
      - More tests for Offline::UPS.
      - Updated the Interchange UserTag simulator, and make it a part of the
