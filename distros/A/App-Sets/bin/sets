sets - set operations in Perl

=head1 USAGE

   sets [--usage] [--help] [--man] [--version]

   sets [--binmode|-b <string>]
        [--cache-sorted|-S <suffix>]
        [--internal-sort|-I]
        [--loglevel|-l <level>]
        [--sorted|-s]
        [--trim|-t]
        expression...

=head1 EXAMPLES

   # intersect two files
   sets file1 ^ file2

   # things are speedier when files are sorted
   sets -s sorted-file1 ^ sorted-file2

   # you can use a bit caching in case, generating sorted files
   # automatically for possible multiple or later reuse. For example,
   # the following is the symmetric difference where the sorting of
   # the input files will be performed two times only
   sets -S .sorted '(file1 - file2) + (file2 - file1)'

   # In the example above, note that expressions with grouping need to be
   # specified in a single string.

   # sometimes leading and trailing whitespaces only lead to trouble, so
   # you can trim data on-the-fly
   sets -t file1-unix - file2-dos

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This program lets you perform set operations working on input files.

The set operations that can be performed are the following:

=over

=item B<< intersection >>

the binary operation that selects all the elements that are in both
the left and the right hand operand. This operation can be specified with
any of the following operators:

=over

=item B<< intersect >>

=item B<< i >>

=item B<< I >>

=item B<< & >>

=item B<< ^ >>

=back

=item B<< union >>

the binary operation that selects all the elements that are in either
the left or the right hand operand. This operation can be specified with
any of the following operators:

=over

=item B<< union >>

=item B<< u >>

=item B<< U >>

=item B<< v >>

=item B<< V >>

=item B<< | >>

=item B<< + >>

=back

=item B<< difference >>

the binary operation that selects all the elements that are in
the left but not in the right hand operand. This operation can be
specified with any of the following operators:

=over

=item B<< minus >>

=item B<< less >>

=item B<< \ >>

=item B<< - >>

=back

=back


Expressions can be grouped with parentheses, so that you can set the
precedence of the operations and create complex aggregations. For
example, the following expression computes the symmetric difference
between the two sets:

   (set1 - set2) + (set2 - set1)

Expressions should be normally entered as a single string that is then
parsed. In case of I<simple> operations (e.g. one operation on two
sets) you can also provide multiple arguments. In other terms, the
following invocations should be equivalent:

   sets 'set1 - set2'
   sets set1 - set2

Options can be specified only as the first parameters. If your first
set begins with a dash, use a double dash to explicitly terminate the
list of options, e.g.:

   sets -- -first-set ^ -second-set

In general, anyway, the first non-option argument terminates the list
of options as well, so the example above would work also without the
C<-->. In the pathological case that your file is named C<-s>, anyway,
you would need the explicit termination of options with C<-->. You get
the idea.

Files with spaces and other weird stuff can be specified by means
of quotes or escapes. The following are all valid methods of subtracting
C<to remove> from C<input file>:

   sets "'input file' - 'to remove'"
   sets '"input file" - "to remove"'
   sets 'input\ file - to\ remove'
   sets "input\\ file - to\\ remove"
   sets input\ file - to\ remove

The first two examples use single and double quoting. The third example
uses a backslash to escape the spaces, as well as the fourth example in
which the escape character is repeated due to the interpolation rules
of the shell. The last example leverages upon the shell rules for
escaping AND the fact that simple expressions like that can be specified
as multiple arguments instead of a single string.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over

=item --binmode | -b I<string>

set a string for calling C<binmode> on STDOUT. By default,
C<:raw:encoding(UTF-8)> is set, to normalize newlines handling and
expect UTF-8 data in.

=item --cache-sorted | -S I<suffix>

input files are sorted and saved into a file with the same name and the
I<suffix> appended, so that if this file exists it is used instead of
the input file. In this way it is possible to generate sorted files on
the fly and reuse them if available. For example, suppose that you want
to remove the items in C<removeme> from files C<file1> and C<file2>; in
the following invocations:

   sets file1 - removeme > file1.filtered
   sets file2 - removeme > file2.filtered

we have that file C<removeme> would be sorted in both calls, while in the
following ones:

   sets -S .sorted file1 - removeme > file1.filtered
   sets -S .sorted file2 - removeme > file2.filtered

it would be sorted only in the first call, that generates C<removeme.sorted>
that is then reused by the second call. Of course you're trading disk space
for speed here, but most of the times it is exactly what you want to do when
you have disk space but little time to wait. This means that most of the
times you'll e wanting to use this option, I<unless> you're willing to wait
more or you already know that input files are sorted (in which case you would
use C<< --sorted | -s >> instead).

=item --help

print a somewhat more verbose help, showing usage, this description of
the options and some examples from the synopsis.

=item --internal-sort | -I

force using the internal sorting facility even if external C<sort> is
available. Some rough benchmark showed that this is slower about 7%
with respect to using the external C<sort>, so avoid this if you can.

=item --loglevel | -l I<level>

set the verbosity of the logging subsystem. Allowed values (in increasing
verbosity): C<TRACE>, C<DEBUG>, C<INFO>, C<WARN>, C<ERROR> and C<FATAL>.

=item --man

print out the full documentation for the script.

=item --sorted | -s

in normal mode, input files are sorted on the fly before being used. If you
know that I<all> your input files are already sorted, you can spare the
extra sorting operation by using this option:

   sets -s file1.sorted ^ file2.sorted

=item --trim | -t

if you happen to have leading and/or trailing white spaces (including
tabs, carriage returns, etc.) that you want to get rid of, you can turn
this option on. This is particularly useful if some files come from the
UNIX world and other ones from the DOS world, becaue they have different
ideas about terminating a line.

=item --usage

print a concise usage line and exit.

=item --version

print the version of the script.

=back

=head1 ENVIRONMENT

Some options can be set from the environment:

=over

=item C<SETS_CACHE>

the same as specifying C<< --cache-sorted | -S I<suffix> >> on the
command line. The contents of C<SETS_CACHE> is used as the I<suffix>.

=item C<SETS_INTERNAL_SORT>

the same as specifying C<< --internal-sort | -I >> on the command line.

=item C<SETS_MAX_FILES>

maximum number of (temporary) files to keep when using the internal sorting
facility.

=item C<SETS_MAX_RECORDS>

maximum number of input records to keep in memory when using the internal
sorting facility.

=item C<SETS_SORTED>

the same as specifying C<--sorted | -s> on the command line

=item C<SETS_TRIM>

the same as specifying C<--trim | -t> on the command line
