1.05    Mon Oct 27 13:00:00 2003
    * Added the ability to return tokens, to make XML::RTF::SAX a little

    - Created the _get_line() subroutine
    - Corrected documentation about read_file() behaviour
    - Stopped the {_BUFFER} being overwritten on read
    - Various bits of POD cleaned up
    - Ability to control how many characters are read determining IRS
