        * Added ResultRow objects to simplify API
          (one object for hash and array access). Using Class::InsideOut

          - Service::resultset for queries
        * Added more aliases, with docs, including
          - Query::count/get_count
        * Hid internal methods, such as Query::push_constraints (and others)
        * Changed logic behaviour on adding constraint
          (don't discard current logic completely)

0.9705 2011-06-08 19:34:43 BST

        * Bug-fix release - Fixed handling of empty result sets - added test

0.9702 2011-06-04
        * Bug-fix release - subclass parsing was broken

0.9701 2011-06-04
        * Improved template parsing speed by only parsing what is requested
        * Improved show printing format with more appropriate column sizes,
          and column guides.

0.9700 2011-06-02
        * Changed result parsing logic - uses a JSON format internally for all 
          non trivial parsing to ensure safety of field content and diagnostics 
          of errors.
        * Enabled lazy iteration of result sets by default.
          This improves responsiveness for large datasets.
        * Incorporated iteration into queries as a transparent feature.
        * Added list services (creation, deletion, renaming, intersection,
          unions, differences, subtraction, appending)
        * Added summary methods (show)
        * Added template and query upload methods

0.9605 2011-03-12
        * Added Webservice::InterMine::Simple (see benchmarks)
            There is a compilation penalty inherent in the use of Moose
            and meta-class introspection. While perfectly acceptable 
            when multiple queries are made withing the same process, 
            for the common use case of a single query, the user may wish for
            something more performant. In this case, a script that uses 
            Webservice::InterMine::Simple will gain a full magnitude increase
            in performance (3.5p/s vs 0.33p/s). However, multiple queries
            within the same process do not see a similar improvement, it being
            more in the range of 300% (70p/s vs 250p/s). Where speed is
            important, and more sophisticated features are not required,
            a Simple service may be appealing
         * Added support for headers.

0.9604 2011-03-03 17:27:14 GMT
        * Removed last use of testmodel_model.xml, and removed it from dist
        * Changed logic writer to set_logic for consistency
        * Added command line utilities
        * Added moose hygiene test, and made it pass
        * More POD (especially in important roles)
        * Added size and start (paging) capabilities to Runnable queries

0.9603 2011-03-01 15:28:18 GMT
        * Now using the TestModel instance - big effect on test run speed

0.9602 2011-02-28 19:25:19 GMT
        * Model bug fix required changes to some tests, and 
          one or two places in the path logic

0.9601 2011-02-25 16:26:39 GMT
        * Bug fixes (including a couple of useless imports)
        * Queries stringify to their xml representation
        * More documentation

0.9600 2011-02-18 16:37:38 GMT
        * Better verification of version strings, and better coercion of urls
        * Load queries from local xml
        * Support for InterMine xml shortcuts (lt for &lt;, etc.)
        * Tests in support of json rows format

0.9501 2011-02-03 13:36:04 GMT
        * Added bug due to mis-matching test counts in acceptance test

0.9500 2011-02-02 17:01:19 GMT
        * Added support for authenticated requests
        * Fixed bug in ResultIterator due to loose quotes. Thanks Kim.
        * Added support for new JSON formats, including inflation
        * Added bug in Join.pm which was preventing builds.

        * Fixed errors in documentation
        * Fixed bug with template queries and extra values

0.9408 2010-10-11 13:08:42 BST
        * Perl::Tidy and YAML::Syck now recommendations.
        * Changed WriteOutYaml role to dump to string rather than file

0.9407 2010-10-08 12:43:11 BST
        * Readded Perl::Tidy as dependency to fix tests
        * Changed attribute type in TemplateFactory in response
          to change in Moose 1.15

0.9403 2010-09-21 14:32:34 BST
        * Finally removed last reference to IO::String

0.9402 2010-09-21 11:33:19 BST
        * Removed useless dependency that broke install
