        initial published revision

        * added more tests and META.yml

        * Changed all perl files to non-executable

        This will be the last supported version of List::Rotation::Cycle
        (unless someone finds some bugs).
        I suggest you use List::Rotation instead.
        The Module List::Rotation also contains a package
        List::Rotation::Cycle     and some derivatives of it
        List::Rotation::Alternate and
        List::Rotation::Toggle
