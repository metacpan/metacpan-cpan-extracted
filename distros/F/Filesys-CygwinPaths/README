Filesys/CygwinPaths version 0.03
================================

A perl extension for doing various path translations on Cygwin. Is
expected to be built and run on CygwinPerl only. Requires the gcc
C compiler that comes with Cygwin; calls the Cygwin C API.

ABOUT "exoMakefile.PL" >>READ THIS<<

One non-standard, puzzling file will be found in this distribution. The
<exoMakefile.PL> is included because the author uses it to build and install
this module on his own systems. The author is developing a separate perl
project named "ExoBuild" that allows building of Perl extension modules from
source ("manual installation") located remotely from the build directory.
Thus, an "exobuild." Those familiar with GNU software packages will
recognize the paradigm. Heretofore, Perl 5 did not support this approach to
build configuration through its built-in ExtUtils::MakeMaker facilities. The
ExoBuild package will, when released, allow users who prefer to, to build
from a read-only medium containing expanded module source trees, for
instance. The user will simply cd into a build directory created for the
purpose of module installation, tell ExoBuild where the source is located and
off it goes.

ExoBuild is not yet available as of this writing, for testing or download.
Those interested in it are certainly encouraged to encourage the author by
writing me at <somian -AT- pobox -DOT- com>.


INSTALLATION

To install this module the standard Perl way, type the following:

  perl Makefile.PL [ (INSTALLDIRS=[site(is the default)|perl|vendor]) | PREFIX=xxx ]
  make
 #make test  TODO
  make install_dry_run  # to preview that install will do What You Expect (TM).
  make install

Report bugs in the build configuration to the package author. Please be
aware that this module hasn't been tested for use on perls < 5.006 (5.6.1)
and that it requires the use of the ExtUtils::MakeMaker package to build and
install. Please upgrade to the latest release of ExtUtils::MakeMaker (6.05
as of this writing) if you have not already done so. It comprises a major
overhaul of this venerable code and important bug-fixes. Available at a CPAN
proxy near you :-).


DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules and libraries:

  Cygwin's system headers and libs.
