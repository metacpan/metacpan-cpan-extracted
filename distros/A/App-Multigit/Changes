    - mg-init has learned new tricks
      * Clones missing repos
        * or removes them from config
      * Can remove repos rather than re-registering them
      * Accepts file parameter to initialise from
    - Underlying IO::Async::Process can be told not to chdir
    - init is now called mkconfig
