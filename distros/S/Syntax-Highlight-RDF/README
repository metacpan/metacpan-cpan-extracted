NAME
    Syntax::Highlight::RDF - syntax highlighting for various RDF-related
    formats

SYNOPSIS
      use Syntax::Highlight::RDF;
      my $syntax = "Syntax::Highlight::RDF"->highlighter("Turtle");
      print $syntax->highlight($filehandle);

DESCRIPTION
    Outputs pretty syntax-highlighted HTML for RDF-related formats. (Actually
    just adds `<span>` elements with `class` attributes. You're expected to
    bring your own CSS.)

  Formats
    *   N-Triples

    *   N-Quads

    *   Turtle

    *   TriG

    *   Notation 3

    *   Pretdsl

    *   SPARQL Query 1.1 (but not property paths yet)

    *   SPARQL Update 1.1 (but not property paths yet)

    *   JSON - intended for RDF/JSON and SPARQL Results JSON, but just generic
        highlighting

    *   XML - intended for RDF/XML and SPARQL Results XML, but just generic
        highlighting

  Methods
    `highlighter($format)`
        Factory method; generally preferred over calling `new` on a specific
        class.

          "Syntax::Highlight::RDF"->highlighter("Turtle");
          "Syntax::Highlight::RDF::Turtle"->new;  # avoid!

    `highlight($input, $base)`
        Highlight some RDF.

        $input may be a file handle, filename or a scalar ref of text. (Most
        highlighters will also attempt to Do What You Mean if passed something
        else sane like an RDF::Trine::Model.) $base is an optional base for
        resolving relative URIs.

        Returns a string of HTML.

    `tokenize($input)`
        This is mostly intended for subclassing Syntax::Highlight::RDF.

        $input may be a file handle, filename or a scalar ref of text.

        Returns an arrayref of token objects. The exact API for the token
        objects is subject to change, but currently they support `TYPE` and
        `spelling` methods.
