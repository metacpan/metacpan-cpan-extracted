=head1 NAME

Apache::Solr::Result - Apache Solr (Lucene) result container

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  # All operations return a ::Result object
  my $result = $solr->select(...);

  $result->success or die $result->solrError; # error reported by Solr
  $result->success or die $result->errors;    # any error caught by this object
  if($result)  # same as if($result->success)

  # Lots of trace information included
  $result->showTimings;

  # ::Document containing the requested fields from a select() search
  my $doc1   = $result->selected(0);

  # ::Document containing the highlight info from a selected document
  my $hl1    = $result->highlighted($doc1);

  # Some operations have helper methods
  my $result = $solr->queryTerm(...);
  print Dumper $result->terms;

=item params => ARRAY

=item request => HTTP::Request object

=item response => HTTP::Response object

=item sequential => BOOLEAN

[1.06] By setting this, you indicate that you will process the documents
in (numeric) sequential order; that you have no intention to go back to
a lower number.  This implies that those cached results can be cleaned-up
in the client early, reducing memory consumption.

However: you are allowed to go back to lower numbers, with the penalty
of a repeat of a message exchange between this client and the database.

=head2 Accessors

=over 4

=item $obj-E<gt>B<core>()

[0.95] May return the L<Apache::Solr|Apache::Solr> object which created this result.

=item $obj-E<gt>B<decoded>( [HASH] )

=item $obj-E<gt>B<elapse>()

Number of seconds used to receive a decoded answer.

=item $obj-E<gt>B<endpoint>()

The URI where the request is sent to.

=item $obj-E<gt>B<errors>()

All errors collected by this object into one string.

=item $obj-E<gt>B<httpError>()

=item $obj-E<gt>B<params>()

List of (expanded) parameters used to call the solr server.

=item $obj-E<gt>B<request>( [$request] )

=item $obj-E<gt>B<response>( [$response] )

=item $obj-E<gt>B<sequential>()

[1.06] Shows whether the results are only read in numeric order.

=item $obj-E<gt>B<serverError>()

=item $obj-E<gt>B<solrError>()

=item $obj-E<gt>B<solrQTime>()

Elapse (as reported by the server) to handle the request.  In seconds!

=item $obj-E<gt>B<solrStatus>()

=item $obj-E<gt>B<start>()

The timestamp of the moment the call has started, including the creation of
the message to be sent.

=item $obj-E<gt>B<success>()

Returns true if the command has successfully completed.  

example: 

   my $result = $sorl->commit;
   $result->success or die;
   $result or die;          # same, via overloading
   $solr->commit or die;    # same, also overloading

=back

=head2 Response information

=head3 in response to a select()

=over 4

=item $obj-E<gt>B<highlighted>($document)

Return information which relates to the selected $document.

=item $obj-E<gt>B<nextSelected>(%options)

[0.95] Produces the next document, or C<undef> when there are none left.
[1.06] Use L<selected()|Apache::Solr::Result/"in response to a select()"> or search parameter C<start> to give a starting
point.  [1.06] The C<%options> are passed to L<selected()|Apache::Solr::Result/"in response to a select()">.

example: 

  my $result = $solr->select(q => ...);
  while(my $doc = $result->nextSelected)
  {   my $hl = $result->highlighted($doc);
  }

=item $obj-E<gt>B<nrSelected>()

Returns the number of selected documents, as result of a
L<Apache::Solr::select()|Apache::Solr/"Search"> call.  Probably many of those documents are
not loaded (yet).

example: 

  print $result->nrSelected, " results\n";

  for(my $docnr = 0; $docnr < $result->nrSelected; $docnr++)
  {   my $doc = $result->selected($docnr);
      ...
  }
  # easier:
  while(my $doc = $result->nextSelected) ...

=item $obj-E<gt>B<selected>($rank, %options)

Returns information about the query by L<Apache::Solr::select()|Apache::Solr/"Search"> on
position $rank (count starts at 0!)  Returned is an L<Apache::Solr::Document|Apache::Solr::Document>
object.

The first request will take a certain number of "rows".  This routine
will automatically collect more of the selected answers, when you address
results outside the first "page" of "rows".  The results of these other
requests are cached as well.

This method has no C<%options> at the moment.

example: 

   my $r = $solr->select(rows => 10, ...);
   $r or die $r->errors;

   if(my $last = $r->selected(9)) {...}
   my $doc = $r->selected(11);         # auto-request more

=back

=head3 in response to a queryTerms()

=over 4

=item $obj-E<gt>B<terms>( $field, [$terms] )

Returns the results of a 'terms' query (see L<Apache::Solr::queryTerms()|Apache::Solr/"Search">),
which is a HASH.  When $terms are specified, a new table is set.

In Solr XML (at least upto v4.0) the results are presented as lst, not arr
So: their sort order is lost.

=back

=head2 Helpers

=over 4

=item $obj-E<gt>B<fullPageSize>()

[1.07] Returns the page size of all of the full returned pages.  The last page
is probably smaller.

=item $obj-E<gt>B<replaceParams>(HASH, $oldparams)

=item $obj-E<gt>B<selectedPage>($pagenr)

The L<selected()|Apache::Solr::Result/"in response to a select()"> documents are retreived in pages, each of size
L<fullPageSize()|Apache::Solr::Result/"Helpers"> (although the last page may be shorter).  Each
page is separately downloaded when used.  Each page is also a
full C<Apache::Solr::Result> object with request, response, and timing
information.

=item $obj-E<gt>B<selectedPageLoad>($rank, $client)

Query the database for the next page of results.

=item $obj-E<gt>B<selectedPageNr>($rank)

=item $obj-E<gt>B<selectedPageSize>()

[1.07] DEPRECATED.  Use L<fullPageSize()|Apache::Solr::Result/"Helpers">.

=item $obj-E<gt>B<selectedPages>()

=item $obj-E<gt>B<showTimings>( [$fh] )

Print timing informat to the $fh, by default the selected
file-handle (probably STDOUT).
