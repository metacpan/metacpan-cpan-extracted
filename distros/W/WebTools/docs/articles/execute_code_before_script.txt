Execute code before Script
--------------------------

 In 'Dynamic change of database' we found that WebTools has centralized configuration system!
That's mean that you can't change config.pl dynamicly! Actualy you can but when script is
already executed (see 'Dynamic change of database').
 However feature entered in WebTools ver. 1.24 allows you to set some variables in config.pl
before parsing input,loading libraries (i.e. onStartUp) and just before execution of script
(i.e. onActivate). Something more...you can execute even Perl code.
These features can be useful if you need to modify some restricted options
that commonly is set on default. For example that can be maximum POST size (default 4MB) or
even if you need to change current temp directory and so on...

Example:

<!--#onStartUp>
 # You are in "globexport.pm" -> No webtools functins are avaliable here!
 # If you need to print some messages don't forget "Content-type: text/html\n\n"!
 # Only available due StartUp process (parsing,loading drivers and so on)
 $webtools::my_cgi = 8388608;                  # 8MB (if you want load it from external file)
 $webtools::tmp='/tmp/your_folder/';
 $webtools::cgi_lib_maxdata=$webtools::my_cgi; # Set new POST limit size (8MB)
</#onStartUp-->

<!--#onActivate>
 # You are in "webtools.pm" -> All webtools functins are avaliable here!
 # If you need to print some messages just go ahead :)
 # Available through script execution
 # Currently '$webtools::cgi_lib_maxdata' still has default value (not 8MB)!
 $webtools::cgi_lib_maxdata=$webtools::my_cgi; # Set new POST limit size again for script!!!
 $webtools::db_support='db_mysql';             # ...Change default db driver...
</#onActivate-->

<?perl 
 # Do what you have to do :)

 print '$tmp = \''.$tmp.'\';<BR>';
 print '$cgi_lib_maxdata = \''.$cgi_lib_maxdata.'\';<BR>';

?>

 You see that there are available two diferrent "tag"-s for onStartUp (via globexport.pm)
and onActivate (in webtools.pm)
NOTE: All changes made in 'webtools' namespace through globexport BEGIN section (i.e.
 through "onStartUp") will have no affect (because webtools namespace will be not still
 available!) So if you change for example $webtools::cgi_lib_maxdata in "onStartUp"
 section default value will be afterware available in script! So set value once again
 in "onActivate" section if you want "real" value (set in "onStartUp") to be available
 for script (see example above)!
