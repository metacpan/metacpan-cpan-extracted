PREREQUISITES

    C Compiler

        You need a C compiler to build these modules.

        Ideally you should try to use the same compiler as was used to build
        your perl itself, although this is not essential.  (However, there is a
        known compatibility problem when building this module with Visual Studio
        .NET 2002/2003 (VC7) or earlier if your perl was built with Visual
        Studio 2005 (VC8) or later: see Perl RT#121448.)

    OpenSSL

        OpenSSL version 0.9.6k or 0.9.7c or later.
        The latest version of OpenSSL is available from http://www.openssl.org/.

    Perl

        Perl version 5.8.1 or later.
        The latest version of Perl is available from http://www.perl.com/.

    Perl Modules

        There are no non-standard Perl modules required by the two main modules
        in this distribution (Filter::Crypto::CryptFile and
        Filter::Crypto::Decrypt), but the PAR::Filter::Crypto module requires

            PAR::Filter

        which is part of the PAR::Packer distribution, available from CPAN
        (http://www.cpan.org/).

INSTALLATION

    To install these modules, cd to the directory that contains this INSTALL
    file and type the following:

        perl Makefile.PL
        make
        make test
        make install

    The Makefile.PL script will ask various questions regarding (amongst other
    things) the location of OpenSSL or SSLeay, which cipher algorithm to use,
    what password or key to use and whether to install a script.

    Alternatively, command-line options can be used to provide the answers to
    these questions and hence run the script non-interactively.  Type:

        perl Makefile.PL --help

    for more details.

    On Windows, you will need to use "nmake" or "dmake" rather than "make" in
    the commands above, depending on what your perl was built with.  To
    determine which make program was used to build your perl type the following:

        perl -V:make
