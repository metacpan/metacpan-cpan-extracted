NAME
    App::Pipeline::Simple - Simple workflow manager

VERSION
    version 0.9.1

SYNOPSIS
      # called from a script

DESCRIPTION
    Unless you want to change or extend the module, you probably do not need
    to read this documentation. Runtime information is in spipe application.

    Workflow management in computational (biological) sciences is a hard
    problem. This module is based on assumption that UNIX pipe and redirect
    system is closest to optimal solution with these improvements:

    * Enforce the storing of all intermediate steps in a file.

      This is for clarity, accountability and to enable arbitrarily big
      data sets. Pipeline can contain independent steps that remove
      intermediate files if so required.

    * Naming of each step.

      This is to make it possible to stop, restart, and restart at any
      intermediate step after adjusting pipeline parameters.

    * detailed logging

      To keep track of all runs of the pipeline.

    A pipeline is a collection of steps that are functionally equivalent to
    a pipeline. In other words, execution of a pipeline equals to execution
    of a each ordered step within the pipeline. From that derives that the
    pipeline object model needs only one class that can recursively
    represent the whole pipeline as well as individual steps.

METHODS
  new
    Constructor for the class. One instance represents the whole pipeline,
    and other instances are created for each step in the pipeline.

  verbose
    Controls logging output. Defaults to 0.

    Setting verbose sets the logging level:

      verbose   =  -1    0     1
      log level =>  WARN INFO  DEBUG

  config
    Read in the named config file.

  id
    ID of the step

  description
    Verbose description of the step

  name
    Name of the program that will be executed

  path
    Path to the directory where the program resides. Can be used if the
    program is not on path. Will be prepended to the name.

  next_id
    ID of the next step in execution. It typically depends on the output of
    this step.

  input
    Value read in interactively from command line

  itype
    Type of input for the command line value

  start
    The ID of the step to start the execution

  stop
    The ID of the step to stop the execution

  dir
    Working directory where all files are stored.

  step
    Returns the step by its ID.

  each_next
    Return an array of steps after this one.

  each_step
    Return all steps.

  run
    Run this step and call the one(s).

  debug
    Run in debug mode and test the configuration file

  logger
    Reference to the internal Log::Logger4perl object

  render
    Transcribe the step into a UNIX command line string ready for display or
    execution.

  stringify
    Analyze the configuration without executing it.

  graphviz
    Create a GraphViz dot file from the config.
