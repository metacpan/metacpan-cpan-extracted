NAME

    IO::Stream::Proxy::SOCKSv4 - SOCKSv4 proxy plugin for IO::Stream

VERSION

    This document describes IO::Stream::Proxy::SOCKSv4 version v1.0.2

SYNOPSIS

        use IO::Stream;
        use IO::Stream::Proxy::SOCKSv4;
    
        IO::Stream->new({
            ...
            plugin => [
                ...
                proxy   => IO::Stream::Proxy::SOCKSv4->new({
                    host    => 'my.proxy.com',
                    port    => 3128,
                }),
                ...
            ],
        });

DESCRIPTION

    This module is plugin for IO::Stream which allow you to route stream
    through SOCKSv4 proxy.

    You may use several IO::Stream::Proxy::SOCKSv4 plugins for single
    IO::Stream object, effectively creating proxy chain (first proxy plugin
    will define last proxy in a chain).

 SECURITY

    Version 4 of SOCKS protocol doesn't support domain name resolving by
    proxy, so resolving happens always on client side. This may result in
    leaking client's DNS resolver IP address (usually it's client's address
    or client's ISP address) and detecting the fact of using proxy.

 EVENTS

    When using this plugin event RESOLVED will never be delivered to user
    because there may be two hosts to resolve (target host and proxy host)
    and it isn't clear how to handle this case in right way.

    Event CONNECTED will be generated after SOCKS proxy successfully
    connects to target {host} (and not when socket will connect to SOCKS
    proxy itself).

INTERFACE

    new({ host=>$host, port=>$port })

    new({ host=>$host, port=>$port, userid=>$ENV{USER} })

      Connect to proxy $host:$port, optionally using given userid (empty by
      default).

DIAGNOSTICS

    {host}+{port} required

      You must provide both {host} and {port} to
      IO::Stream::Proxy::SOCKSv4->new().

    {fh} already connected

      You have provided {fh} to IO::Stream->new(), but this is not
      supported by this plugin. Either don't use this plugin or provide
      {host}+{port} to IO::Stream->new() instead.

LIMITATIONS

    SOCKS "BIND" request doesn't supported.
