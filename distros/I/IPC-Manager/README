NAME

    IPC::Manager - Decentralized local IPC through various protocols.

DESCRIPTION

    IPC::Manager provides a way to do message based IPC between local (on a
    single machine) processes. It provides multiple protocols for doing
    this, as well as pluggable serialization.

    The idea is to first initialize a data store, provide the info to
    access the data store, then any process may use that info to
    send/recieve messages. The datastore can be temporary (guarded) or
    persistent.

SYNOPSIS

        use IPC::Manager qw/ipcm_connect ipcm_spawn/;
    
        # Let the system pick a protocol and serialization
        my $ipcm = ipcm_spawn();
    
        my $info = $ipcm->info;
        print "You can connect to the IPC using this string: $info\n";
    
        # Get a connection
        my $con1 = ipcm_connect(con1 => $info);
        my $con2 = ipcm_connect(con2 => $info);
    
        # Send a message
        $con1->send_message(con2 => {hello => 'world'});
    
        # Get messages
        if (my @messages = $con2->get_messages) {
            # hashref: {hello => 'world'}
            my $payload = $message[0]->content;
            ...
        }
    
        # Cleanup the datastore (unless `guard => 0` was passed in).
        $guard = undef;

    The idea is to use the ipcm data store as the medium for transferring
    messages. You can use the string returned by $ipcm->info from any
    process to reach the data store.

    You can set up persistent data stores, in which case the ipcm_spawn()
    export is not needed. How to set up a persistent data store is
    documented in each client protocol.

    Messages are instances of IPC::Manager::Message. You can make the
    instances yourself manually and send them, or you can let
    send_message() create them for you:

        $con1->send_message(con2 => IPC::Manager::Message->new(content => \%CONTENT, ...));
        $con1->send_message(con2 => \%CONTENT);

EXPORTS

    $ipcm = ipcm->spawn(...)

    $con = ipcm->connect(...)

    $con = ipcm->reconnect(...)

      ipcm() is an alias for IPC::Manager. You can use it to call spawn,
      connect, or reconnect without importing ipcm_spawn(), ipcm_connect(),
      or ipcm_reconnect() into your namespace.

    $ipcm = ipcm_spawn()

    $ipcm = ipcm_spawn(protocol => $PROTOCOL)

    $ipcm = ipcm_spawn(protocols => \@PROTOCOLS)

    $ipcm = ipcm_spawn(serializer => 'JSON', guard => 1, signal => $SIGNAL)

      This will create a new data store for IPC. By default it will be
      temporary and will be destroyed when the $ipcm object falls out of
      scope.

      You can set guard => 0 to prevent the destruction of the datastore
      when the object falls out of scope.

      You can also set a signal, such as 'INT' or 'TERM' to have the signal
      sent to the PID for all clients when the instance is shut down.

      You can set the serializer with the serializer => $CLASS option.
      'IPC::Manager::Serializer::' will be prefixed onto the class name
      unless it is already present, or if the class name starts with '+'.

      You can pick a protocol with the protocol => $CLASS option.
      'IPC::Manager::Client::' will be prefixed onto the class name unless
      it is already present, or if the class name starts with '+'.

      If you do not care what protocol is used you can leave it blank, in
      which case one will be picked for you based on what your system
      supports. Order in which it will try protocols is subject to change
      at any time.

      If you want to narrow down to a specific set of protocols you may
      provide a list: protocols => [ 'AtomicPipe', 'UnixSocket',
      'PostgreSQL', ... ]. The first viable protocol will be used.

      The object returned is an instance of IPC::Manager::Spawn.

    $con = ipcm_connect($name => $info)

      This is used to establish a connection. The $name should be a unique
      name for your connection, it will be used as the 'from' field for any
      message you send, and will be used by other clients to send messages
      to you.

      The $info argument must be the connection info needed to connect to
      the data store. This is always a 3 element arrayref, or a JSON string
      with the 3 element arrayref.

          [$protocol_class, $serializer_class, $route]
          '["PROTOCOL_CLASS", "SERIALIZER_CLASS", "ROUTE"]'

      The protocol should always be an IPC::Manager::Client subclass. The
      serializer should always be an IPC::Manager::Serializer subclass. The
      route is protocol specific, it may be a file, a directory, a DBI DSN
      string, etc.

    $con = ipcm_reconnect($name => $info)

      Same as 'connect', but used to reconnect as a client that was
      suspended or otherwise disconnected.

CLIENT PROTOCOLS

    See IPC::Manager::Client for common methods across all client types.

 FileSystem Based

    These are all based off of IPC::Manager::Base::FS. These are all based
    on a directory structure of some kind.

    MessageFiles

      IPC::Manager::Client::MessageFiles

      This is the most universal protocol, it works in the most places.

      This uses a directory as the 'route'. Within this directory each
      client creates a subdirectory. Messages are sent by writing a file
      per message to the clients directory. Messages are deleted from the
      filesystem when read.

    AtomicPipe

      IPC::Manager::Client::AtomicPipe

      This uses a directory as the 'route'. This uses the Atomic::Pipe
      library to send atomic messages across pipes. Each client has its own
      FIFO pipe any other process can write to when sending a message.
      Messages are recieved by reading from the pipe. (Multiple writer,
      single reader).

    UnixSocket

      IPC::Manager::Client::UnixSocket

      This uses a directory as the 'route'. This uses unix sockets, one per
      client. Messages are sent by writing them to the correct clients
      socket. (Multiple writer, single reader).

 DBI Based

    These are all based off of IPC::Manager::Base::DBI. These all use a
    database as the message store.

    These all have 1 table for tracking clients, and another for tracking
    messages. Messages are deleted once read. The 'route' is a DSN. You
    also usually need to provide a username and password.

        my $con = ipcm_connect(my_con => $info, user => $USER, pass => $PASS);

    MariaDB

      IPC::Manager::Client::MariaDB

    MySQL

      IPC::Manager::Client::MySQL

    PostgreSQL

      IPC::Manager::Client::PostgreSQL

    SQLite

      IPC::Manager::Client::SQLite

CLEANUP

    When using a temporary instance that cleans up after itself, the
    cleanup process will send terminations messages to all clients, then
    wait for them to disconnect. It will also tell you if there is a
    mismtach between sent and recieved messages.

    See IPC::Manager::Spawn for more information.
