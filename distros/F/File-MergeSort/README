File/MergeSort version 1.23
===========================

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules and libraries:

  IO::File
  Test::More (for running tests during 'make test')

OPTIONAL MODULES:

These modules will be utilised if installed, but are not essential:

  IO::Zlib (for handling compressed files, as discussed above)
  Test::Pod::Coverage (for running additional tests during 'make test')

POINTS TO NOTE

As of version 1.06, sorts are now performed lexicographically, so
File::MergeSort can now merge files with non-numeric merge keys.

As of version 1.10 IO::Zlib is no longer a prerequisite.
If IO::Zlib is installed, File::MergeSort will use it to handle
compressed input files.
If IO::Zlib is not installed and compressed files are specified as
input files, File::MergeSort will raise an exception.
If you do not need to process compressed files, there is no longer any
need install IO::Zlib to use File::MergeSort.
