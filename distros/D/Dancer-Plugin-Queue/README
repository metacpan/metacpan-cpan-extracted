NAME
    Dancer::Plugin::Queue - Dancer plugin for message queue abstractions

VERSION
    version 0.002

SYNOPSIS
      # in config.yml

      plugins:
        Queue:
          default:
            class: Array
            options:
              name: not_a_real_queue

      # in your app

      use Dancer::Plugin::Queue;

      post '/add_fortune' => sub {
        # assume a 'fortune' parameter submitted
        queue->add_msg( params->{fortune} );
        # ...
      };

      get '/tell_fortune' => sub {
        my ($msg, $body) = queue->get_msg;
        queue->remove_msg( $msg );
        return "Your fortune: $body";
      };

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides a generic interface to a message queue. Message
    queue implementations must implement the
    Dancer::Plugin::Queue::Role::Queue role, which defines the interface to
    abstract the specifics of the backend.

CONFIGURATION
    Queue objects are defined by a "NAME => HASHREF" pair. The hash
    reference must contain a 'class' key, whose value is a class name suffix
    that will be appended to "Dancer::Plugin::Queue::". The resulting class
    will be loaded on demand. If the hash reference contains an 'options'
    key, its value will be passed to the constructor when the queue object
    is created.

USAGE
  queue
      queue;
      queue($name);

    This function returns a "Dancer::Plugin::Queue::*" object. If no $name
    is provided, it attempts to return a default object. If there is only a
    single queue defined, it will be used as the default. If there is more
    than one, a queue called 'default' will be the default. If there are
    more than one and none are named 'default', an error will be thrown.

  queue->add_msg
      queue->add_msg( $data );

    Adds $data to the queue. It is up to the plugin implementation (or
    backend) to serialize or otherwise modify $data.

  queue->get_msg
      ( $msg, $data ) = queue->get_msg;

    Dequeues a message from the queue. $msg will be either a 'raw' message
    object from the backend or else an identifier that can be used with
    "remove_msg". $data should ideally be the same as the enqueued $data,
    subject to any round-trip limitations of the backend.

  queue->remove_msg
      queue->remove_msg( $msg );

    Removes a message permanently from the queue (if not already done by
    "get_msg").

    Some message queue implementations require handled messages to be
    manually removed from the queue or else the message will time-out and be
    available again.

    This method should always be called after a message has been handled in
    case the backend requires such cleanup. For implementations that do not
    have message durability, this method may do nothing.
