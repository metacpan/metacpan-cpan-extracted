=head1 C3 mixin introduction

Let's assume there is a Server with core functions defined in basic class.

    package MyBase {
        sub new {
            my $class = shift;
            return bless {} => $class;
        };
        sub on_client {
            my ($self, $client) = @_;
            print "MyBase::on_client\n";
            if ($client->{status} eq 'authorized'){ $client->{send} = '[welcome]' }
            elsif ($client->{status} eq 'not_authorized') { $client->{send} = '[disconnect]' };
        }
    }

The package is responsible for constructing object and send to client either
C<[welcome]> string upon successful login and C<[disconnect]> upon login falure.
It is desirable to have dedicated logging and authorizing components.

    package MyLogger {
        use base qw/MyBase/;    # (1)

        sub new {
            my $class = shift;
            my $obj = $class->next::method(@_) // {};   # (2)
            return bless $obj => $class;
        }
        sub on_client {
            my ($self, $client) = @_;
            print "MyLogger::on_client\n";  # (3)
            print "client ", $client->{id}, ", status = ", $client->{status}, "\n";
            $self->next::method($client);   # (4)
            print "client ", $client->{id}, ", status = ", $client->{status}, "\n";
        }
    }

    package MyAuth {
        use base qw/MyBase/;    # (5)

        sub new {
            my $class = shift;
            my $obj = $class->next::method(@_) // {};   # (6)
            return bless $obj => $class;
        }
        sub on_client {
            my ($self, $client) = @_;
            print "MyAuth::on_client\n";    # (7)
            if ($client->{id} < 0) { $client->{status} = 'not_authorized'; }
            else { $client->{status} = 'authorized'; }
            $self->next::method($client);   # (8)
        }
    };

C<MyBase> class is used as interface; I B<have to define> it's interface method
(C<on_client> in our case), which might be empty. The C<MyLogger> and C<MyAuth>
are designed as plugins, which might intercept/proxy method of base class. To
be sure that some basic implementation is still exist I<beyond> them, they
do inrerit from C<MyBase> (1), (5).

As with classical inheritance in Perl, the code should be aware of derived
classes in (2) and (6), but as the subroutines do nothing here they can be
omitted. The lines (3), (4), (7) are inserted for trace purposes.

There might be different policies how to forward to next method: in C<MyLogger>
it mimics C<around> like in L<Class::Method::Modifiers>, but it is possible
to have C<before> and C<after>.

The real magic happens in C<next::method> (4) and (8): the plugins forwards
call either to base class C<MyBase> or to next plugin. This is not known
at the place of invocation and it is defined at place, where plug-ins are
inherited, i.e. in the I<gather point>:

    package MyXServer {
        use base qw/MyLogger MyAuth MyBase/;    # (9)
        sub new {
            my $class = shift;
            my $obj = $class->next::method(@_) // {};
            return bless $obj => $class;
        }
    };

In (9) it is said that C<MyLogger> plugin's interceptors are executed first,
then C<MyAuth> interceptors are executed, and only then the generic (may be
empty) methods of C<MyBase> will be executed. C3/mro resolves multiple
inheritance problem, i.e. linearizes inheritance tree from most specific
(child) to the most generic (parent) classes.

The sample code

    my $client = {status => 'connected', id => 10};
    my $server = MyXServer->new;
    $server->on_client($client);

will output

    MyLogger::on_client
    client 10, status = connected
    MyAuth::on_client
    MyBase::on_client
    client 10, status = authorized

i.e. it works as expected.

=head1 C3 mixin using XS::Framework

Let's have this mixin logic in XS. The underlying idea is to have independent
C++ classes, which have very fast implementation, which will be bound into
XS-hierarchy. It is important to note, that C++ classes do not form hierarchy
- it is created only on XS level.

Let's suppose that there are the following C++ classes:

    enum class Status07 { CONNECTED = 1, AUTHORIZED = 2, NOT_AUTHORIZED = 3, DISCONNECTED = 4 };

    struct Client07 {
        int id;
        Status07 status;

        Client07 (int id_): id{id_}, status{Status07::CONNECTED } {}
        void disconnect() {
            std::cout << "disconnecting " << id << "\n";
            status = Status07::DISCONNECTED;
        }
        void welcome() {
            std::cout << "[sending] welcome dear client " << id << "\n";
        }
    };

    struct ServerBase07 {
        void on_client(Client07* c) {
            if (c->status == Status07::AUTHORIZED) c->welcome();
            if (c->status == Status07::NOT_AUTHORIZED) c->disconnect();
        }
    };

    struct LoggerPlugin07 {
        void on_client(Client07* c) { std::cout << "client " << c->id << ", status: "  << (int) c->status << "\n"; }
    };

    struct AuthorizerPlugin07 {
        void on_client(Client07* c) {
            c->status = (c->id < 0) ? Status07::NOT_AUTHORIZED : Status07::AUTHORIZED;
        }
    };

The typemaps for them will be rather trivial:

    namespace xs {
        template <>
        struct Typemap<Client07*> : TypemapObject<Client07*, Client07*, ObjectTypePtr, ObjectStorageMG> {
            static std::string package () { return "MyTest::Cookbook::Client07"; }
        };

        template <>
        struct Typemap<ServerBase07*> : TypemapObject<ServerBase07*, ServerBase07*, ObjectTypePtr, ObjectStorageMG> {
            static std::string package () { return "MyTest::Cookbook::ServerBase07"; }
        };

        template <>
        struct Typemap<LoggerPlugin07*> : TypemapObject<LoggerPlugin07*, LoggerPlugin07*, ObjectTypePtr, ObjectStorageMG> {
            static std::string package () { return "MyTest::Cookbook::LoggerPlugin07"; }
        };

        template <>
        struct Typemap<AuthorizerPlugin07*> : TypemapObject<AuthorizerPlugin07*, AuthorizerPlugin07*, ObjectTypePtr, ObjectStorageMG> {
            static std::string package () { return "MyTest::Cookbook::AuthorizerPlugin07"; }
        };
    }

The only moment worth noting is that storage policy should be C<ObjectStorageMG>.
This is needed for the XS-adapters, described below, to allow I<more than one
pointer> for C++ class be stored (associated) with the same Perl SV*.

    MODULE = MyTest                PACKAGE = MyTest::Cookbook::Client07
    PROTOTYPES: DISABLE

    void Client07::disconnect()

    void Client07::welcome()

    Client07* Client07::new(int id)


    MODULE = MyTest                PACKAGE = MyTest::Cookbook::ServerBase07
    PROTOTYPES: DISABLE

    void ServerBase07::on_client(Client07* c)

    ServerBase07* ServerBase07::new()

The xs-adapter for C<Client07> is shown here only for completeness; the
C<ServerBase07> xs-adapter just proxies C<on_client> call to C++ class,
so no any special handling is needed here.

With the mixins/plugins the xs-adapter code is slightly different:

    MODULE = MyTest                PACKAGE = MyTest::Cookbook::LoggerPlugin07
    PROTOTYPES: DISABLE

    void LoggerPlugin07::on_client(Client07* c) {
        THIS->on_client(c);         // (10)
        Object(ST(0)).call_next(cv, &ST(1), items-1);   // (11)
        THIS->on_client(c);     // (12)
    }

    LoggerPlugin07* LoggerPlugin07::new (...) {
        PROTO = Stash::from_name(CLASS).call_next(cv, &ST(1), items-1); // (13)
        if (!PROTO.defined()) XSRETURN_UNDEF;   // (14)
        RETVAL = new LoggerPlugin07();  // (15)
    }

    MODULE = MyTest                PACKAGE = MyTest::Cookbook::AuthorizerPlugin07
    PROTOTYPES: DISABLE

    void AuthorizerPlugin07::on_client(Client07* c) {
        THIS->on_client(c); // (16)
        Object(ST(0)).call_next(cv, &ST(1), items-1);   // (17)
    }

    AuthorizerPlugin07* AuthorizerPlugin07::new (...) {
        PROTO = Stash::from_name(CLASS).call_next(cv, &ST(1), items-1); // (18)
        if (!PROTO.defined()) XSRETURN_UNDEF;   // (19)
        RETVAL = new AuthorizerPlugin07();      // (20)
    }

As with C<ServerBase07> the C<LoggerPlugin07> and C<AuthorizerPlugin07> should
forward call (10), (16) to underlying C++ class to actual job. Then C<on_client>
call should be forwarded to the next implementation (11), (17); this is similar
to the C<next::method> calls in (4) and (8) in pure Perl implementation above.
It actually forwards all arguments with which the xs-adapter was invoked. The
line (12) is needed as we know, that client object might be changed after
processing in further pipeline.

Let's explain constructor: the lines (13)..(15) and (18)..(19) are similar to
the pure Perl plugins constructor (2) and (6). Do not be confused with variable
name C<PROTO>. Actually it is equal not to class name; instead it already
contains blessed Perl SV* with pointer to C<ServerBase07> C++ class. According
to C<TypemapObject::out> mechanics, if the C<hint> ( = C<PROTO> in the context)
parameter is blessed Perl SV*, it will return the same SV* with the additional
pointer (C<LoggerPlugin07> or C<AuthorizerPlugin07> in the context) attached
to it.

    MODULE = MyTest                PACKAGE = MyTest::Cookbook::Server07
    PROTOTYPES: DISABLE

    BOOT {
        auto stash = Stash(__PACKAGE__, GV_ADD);    // (21)
        stash.inherit("MyTest::Cookbook::LoggerPlugin07");
        stash.inherit("MyTest::Cookbook::AuthorizerPlugin07");
        stash.inherit("MyTest::Cookbook::ServerBase07");
    }

As in corresponding pure Perl code (9) the resulting final class just
enumerates the ancestor classes in the correct order. The C<GV_ADD> (21)
is needed to register the xs-adapter class in perl interpreter to let
it be known.

For the sample test code

    my $client2 = MyTest::Cookbook::Client07->new(10);
    my $server2 = MyTest::Cookbook::Server07->new;
    $server2->on_client($client2);

the output is

    client 10, status: 1
    [sending] welcome dear client 10
    client 10, status: 2

i.e. it works as expected.

The short summary: Perl offers powerful C3 inheritance mechanism, which is not
available in C++. It is still possible to use the best from the two worlds:
the flexibilty of Perl's mro-dispatching and fast C++ implementation.
