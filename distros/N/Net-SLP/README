Net-SLP version 0.01
========================

This module provides a Perl interface the the standard SLP API as
described in RFC2614. SLP is the Service Location Protocol, and is
used to find servers for specific services. SLPv2 is described in
RFC2608.

This module has been tested against Openslp 1.0.11 and 1.2.1
(http://www.openslp.org). In principal it should work with other SLP
APIs that conform to the RFC, though this has not been tested. Details
and reports of other ports (and patches) are welcome.

The module provides a straight translation of the C API. There is no
OO interface.

The following SSL API calls are not implemented: 
SLPParseSrvURL()
SLPFree()

Asynchronous operation has not been tested.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules and libraries:

Openslp 1.0.11 or 1.2.1 or later (if you install from RPMS, you will
need both openslp and openslp-devel). http://www.openslp.org

An SLP server (slpd) is required to be running during 'make test',
since the test suite accesses the server. The test suite creates a
test service entry, runs some tests on it, then deletes the service.
