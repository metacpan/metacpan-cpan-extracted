# This is a configuration file for the smoke tester.
# $Id$
# Lines starting with # are comments.
# Lines starting with = are section breaks;
# The rest of the line will be ignored.
# Lines starting with / signify a pattern to substitute for in Policy.sh
# They don't count as a normal line
# This happens to be a section, but because it's *all* just blank lines
# (comments are ignored) this whole section will be ingored.
#
# Each normal line of a section defines a command line argument to Configure
# A blank line in a normal section means an argument of ""
# Each line from the first section is tried with each line of the second
# section with each line of the third section ...
# As this default configuration file has 3 (non-empty) sections with 2, 4,
# and 2 lines defining Configure arguments it will build  16 variations of
# perl, each of them will be tested with $PERLIO = "stdio" and "perlio" so
# yielding 40 status letters

# The pattern must have leading and trailing '/' characters in this
# configuration file. The smoke tester will globally substitute this pattern
# with each Congfigure argument in this section  (as well as passing them on
# the command line to Configure)
# This is usually used with the cflags parameter in Policy.sh, which defines
# flags to pass to the C compiler.  The default  Policy.sh contains the line
# "ccflags='-DDEBUGGING'" and this pattern will cause the value in the '' to
# be replaced with an empty string and then -DDEBUGGING.
# (It may seem a bit convaluted making a system to replace  -DDEBUGGING with
#  the same string  -DDEBUGGING,  but it means that a site's valid Policy.sh
#  can be used for smoke testing)
#
# Hopefully it will not be a problem that the arguments are both substituted
# into cflags and passed on the commandline to Configure, as  Configure will
# ignore arguments starting -D that it does not recognise.
#
# You can specify the same pattern  in more than one  section.  In this case
# the substitution replacement will be all  Configure  arguments joined with
# spaces.   This lets you have one section  testing  ("", "-DDEBUGGING"),  a
# second testing ("", "-DCRIPPLED_CC") and have cflags set correctly for the
# 4 combinations.
