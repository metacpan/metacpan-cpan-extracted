0.07    Mon, 03 Jan 2011 18:49:06 UTC
	Spec V2.15 / Google compatibility
	* Add scope param to Client
	* Always include grant_type param
	* Have POST request send params in body rather than URL query string
	* Allow user to specify name of access token query param in protected resource requests, 
	since Google calls it oauth_token rather than access_token.  This can be passed to the 
	client constructor as access_token_param => 'oauth_token'.
	* Changed the default access_token_method to POST from GET
	* Added a Google demo to the demo app that's included with the module package ( hosted at http://oauth2.kg23.com ).

	Example values of this parameter:
	auth-header (default, same as auth-header:OAuth)
	auth-header:Bearer (custom scheme)
	auth-header:OAuth2 (custom scheme)
	uri-query (same as uri-query:oauth_token)
	uri-query:my_token_param (custom param name)
	form-body (same as form-body:oauth_token)
	form-body:my_token_param (custom param name)
