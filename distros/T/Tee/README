NAME
    Tee - Pure Perl emulation of GNU tee

VERSION
    version 0.14

SYNOPSIS
      # from Perl
      use Tee;
      tee( $command, @files );
 
      # from the command line
      $ cat README.txt | ptee COPY.txt

DESCRIPTION
    The "Tee" distribution provides the ptee program, a pure Perl emulation
    of the standard GNU tool "tee". It is designed to be a
    platform-independent replacement for operating systems without a native
    "tee" program. As with "tee", it passes input received on STDIN through
    to STDOUT while also writing a copy of the input to one or more files.
    By default, files will be overwritten.

    Unlike "tee", "ptee" does not support ignoring interrupts, as signal
    handling is not sufficiently portable.

    The "Tee" module provides a convenience function that may be used in
    place of "system()" to redirect commands through "ptee".

USAGE
  "tee()"
       tee( $command, @filenames );
       tee( $command, \%options, @filenames );

    Executes the given command via "system()", but pipes it through ptee to
    copy output to the list of files. Unlike with "system()", the command
    must be a string as the command shell is used for redirection and
    piping. The return value of "system()" is passed through, but reflects
    the success of the "ptee" command, which isn't very useful.

    The second argument may be a hash-reference of options. Recognized
    options include:

    *   stderr -- redirects STDERR to STDOUT before piping to ptee (default:
        false)

    *   append -- passes the "-a" flag to ptee to append instead of
        overwriting (default: false)

LIMITATIONS
    Because of the way that "Tee" uses pipes, it is limited to capturing a
    single input stream, either STDOUT alone or both STDOUT and STDERR
    combined. A good, portable alternative for capturing these streams from
    a command separately is IPC::Run3, though it does not allow passing it
    through to a terminal at the same time.
