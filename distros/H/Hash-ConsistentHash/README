Hash-ConsistentHash

Hash::ConsistentHash algorithm distributes keys over fixed number of buckets. 
Constant hash distribution means that if we add a bucket to a hash with N 
buckets filled with M keys we have to reassign only M/(N+1) keys to new 
buckets.

What puts apart this module from all similar modules available is that you
could ask for non-repeatable series of buckets. Using this property you 
could implement not only consistent distribution but also redundancy - one
key to be directed to more than one bucket.
