Sudo version 0.33
=================

    Sudo runs commands as another user, provided the system sudo
    implementation is setup to enable this. This does not allow running
    applications securely, simply it allows the programmer to run a program
    as another user (suid) using the sudo tools rather than suidperl.
  
    This module specifically runs a single command to get output which is
    passed back to the user. The module does not currently allow for
    interactive bidirectional communication between the callee and caller.
    The module does not spool input into the callee.
    
    Note:  THIS MODULE WILL NOT WORK IN WINDOWS.  This is a windows issue
    and not a module issue.  In short, there is no equivalent to Sudo
    in windows.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

Note:  The tests MUST be run interactively.  You will be prompted for a
username and password. These are used only to test the module talking to 
Sudo, so this user name and password must enable execution of the id program.
You will need to have Sudo set up properly before this runs.


DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules and libraries:

  Class::Accessor IPC::Run


RESTRICTIONS/PLATFORMS

This module will work only on Unix/Linux systems with a functional and
operational Sudo command.  It will not work under Windows, and without
further work to make sudo function properly under cygwin, it will not 
work under cygwin.
