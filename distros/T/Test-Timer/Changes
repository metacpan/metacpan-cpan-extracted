2.09 2017-11-24 Maintenance release, update not required

- Attempting to address issues with tests on Windows

  REF: http://www.cpantesters.org/distro/T/Test-Timer.html?grade=3&perlmat=2&patches=2&oncpan=2&distmat=2&perlver=ALL&osname=ALL&version=2.08

- Reinstated sleep over select in the test suite

- Changed some test parameters was made a bit less relaxed attempting to decrease the execution time
  for the test suite

2.08 2017-11-20 Maintenance release, update not required

- Addressing reports on failing tests from CPAN testers


2.07 2017-11-18 Maintenance release, update not required

- Addressing issue #17, the tests are now more liberal, so when executed
  on smokers, CI environments and similar, load will not influence the
  test results. The requirement for Test::Tester has been updated and a patch
  required by this distribution has been included


2.06 2017-11-14 Maintenance release, update not required

- Added cancellation of alarm, based on advice from Erik Johansen

2.04 2017-10-15 Maintenance release, update not required

- Minor improvements to Test::Timer::TimeoutException, some obsoleted code could
  be removed

- Generalizing test asserting, since CPAN testers are sometime contrained on resources,
  making it impossible to predict the actual timeout value

  Example: http://www.cpantesters.org/cpan/report/2561e32c-9efa-11e7-bc90-bbe42ddde1fb
