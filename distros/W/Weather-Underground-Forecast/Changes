          Fixes:
          - Use default property for source_URL instead of a lazy builder propery.
            This is an attempt to keep some CPAN testers from getting an empty source_URL.

          Fixes:
          - Adjust basic.t to use the contents when it checks 
            if one has an Internet connection.  This will prevent
            tests from dyeing when trying to get raw_data

          Fixes:
          - Adding XML::Validate::LibXML as a dep. was not enough.
            Need to add XML::LibXML directly.
