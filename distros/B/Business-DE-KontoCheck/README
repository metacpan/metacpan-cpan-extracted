Note: I won't implement other methods and I won't update old ones.
This is too time consuming for me. Anyone who likes to do this,
please contact me.

This is just a release to note the above.

Validating german bank account numbers. At the moment there
are methods 00-74 (from 00-99,A1-A2) implemented. Others will follow.
The methods 00-68 are tested now.
Warnings are now eliminated.
