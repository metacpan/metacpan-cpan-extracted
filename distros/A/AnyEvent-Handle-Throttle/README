NAME
    AnyEvent::Handle::Throttle - AnyEvent::Handle subclass with user-defined
    up/down bandwidth cap

Synopsis
        use AnyEvent;
        use AnyEvent::Handle::Throttle;
        my $condvar = AnyEvent->condvar;
        my $handle;
        $handle = AnyEvent::Handle::Throttle->new(
            upload_limit   => 2,  # Very...
            download_limit => 50, # ...slow
            connect  => ['google.com', 'http'],
            on_error => sub {
                warn "error $_[2]\n";
                $_[0]->destroy;
                $condvar->send;
            },
            on_eof => sub {
                $handle->destroy;
                warn "done.\n";
                $condvar->send;
            }
        );
        $handle->push_write("GET / HTTP/1.0\015\012\015\012");
        $handle->push_read(
            line => "\015\012\015\012",
            sub {
                my ($handle, $line) = @_;
                print "HEADER\n$line\n\nBODY\n";
                $handle->on_read(sub { print $_[0]->rbuf; $_[0]->rbuf = ''; });
            }
        );
        $condvar->recv;

Description
    This class adds a (nearly too) simple throughput limiter to
    AnyEvent::Handle.

Methods
    In addition to AnyEvent::Handle's base methods, this subclass supports
    the following...

    $handle = AnyEvent::Handle::Throttle->new( key => value, ... )
        In addition to the arguments handled by "AnyEvent::Handle->new( ...
        )", this constructor supports these arguments (all as "key => value"
        pairs).

        upload_limit => <bytes>
            This is the maximum amount of data (in bytes) written to the
            filehandle per period. If "upload_limit" is not specified, the
            upload rate is not limited.

            Note that this value can/will override "read_size".

        download_limit => <bytes>
            This is the maximum amount of data (in bytes) read from the
            filehandle per period. If "download_limit" is not specified, the
            upload rate is not limited.

    $handle->upload_limit( $bytes )
        Sets/returns the current upload rate in bytes per period.

    $handle->download_limit( $bytes )
        Sets/returns the current download rate in bytes per period.

    $bytes = $handle->upload_speed( )
        Returns the amount of data written during the previous period.

    $bytes = $handle->download_speed( )
        Returns the amount of data read during the previous period.

    If you're using AnyEvent::Handle::Throttle to limit bandwidth and
    realize you'd rather set flat limits on the total bandwidth instead of
    per-handle, try these methods:

    AnyEvent::Handle::Throttle->global_upload_limit( $bytes )
        Sets/returns the current global upload rate in bytes per period.

    AnyEvent::Handle::Throttle->global_download_limit( $bytes )
        Sets/returns the current global download rate in bytes per period.

    $bytes = $handle->global_upload_speed( )
        Returns the amount of data written through all
        AnyEvent::Handle::Throttle objects during the previous period.

    $bytes = $handle->global_download_speed( )
        Returns the amount of data read through all
        AnyEvent::Handle::Throttle objects during the previous period.

    $bytes = $handle->download_total( )
        Returns the total amount of data read through the
        AnyEvent::Handle::Throttle object.

    $bytes = $handle->upload_total( )
        Returns the total amount of data written through the
        AnyEvent::Handle::Throttle object.

    $bytes = $handle->global_download_total( )
        Returns the total amount of data read through all
        AnyEvent::Handle::Throttle objects so far.

    $bytes = $handle->global_upload_total( )
        Returns the total amount of data sent through all
        AnyEvent::Handle::Throttle objects so far.

Notes
    *   The current default period is 1 second.

    *   On destruction, all remaining data is sent ASAP, ignoring the user
        defined upload limit. This may change in the future.

Bugs
    I'm sure this module is just burting with 'em. When you stumble upon
    one, please report it via the Issue Tracker
