NAME

Hash::SharedMem - efficient shared mutable hash

DESCRIPTION

This module provides a facility for efficiently sharing mutable data
between processes on one host.  Data is organised as a key/value store,
resembling a Perl hash.  The keys and values are restricted to octet
(Latin-1) strings.  Structured objects may be stored by serialising them
using a mechanism such as Sereal.

The data is represented in files that are mapped into each process's
memory space, which for interprocess communication amounts to the
processes sharing memory.  Processes are never blocked waiting for each
other.  The use of files means that there is some persistence, with the
data continuing to exist when there are no processes with it mapped.

The data structure is optimised for the case where all the data fits
into RAM.  This happens either via buffering of a disk-based filesystem,
or as the normal operation of a memory-backed filesystem, in either case
as long as there isn't much swapping activity.  If RAM isn't large enough,
such that the data has to reside mainly on disk and parts of it have to
be frequently reread from disk, speed will seriously suffer.  The data
structure exhibits poor locality of reference, and is not designed to
play nicely with filesystem block sizes.
