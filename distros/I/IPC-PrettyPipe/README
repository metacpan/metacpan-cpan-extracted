IPC::PrettyPipe

NAME

    IPC::PrettyPipe - human readable command pipelines

DESCRIPTION

    IPC::PrettyPipe provides a mechanism to maintain human readable
    execution pipelines.  Pipelines are created by adding commands to
    a IPC::PrettyPipe object.  Options to the commands are set using a
    readable format; IPC::PrettyPipe takes care of quoting strings,
    sticking equal signs in, etc.  The pipeline may be rendered into a
    nicely formatted string, as well as being executed.


INSTALLATION
