NAME

    OPM::Maker::Command::sopm - Build .sopm file based on metadata

VERSION

    version 1.1.0

DESCRIPTION

    SOPM files are used for ticket system addon creation (e.g. for Znuny,
    OTOBO, ((OTRS)) Community Edition). They define some metadata like the
    vendor, their URL, packages required or required Perl modules. It is an
    XML file and it's no fun to create it. It is not uncommon that the list
    of files included in the addon is not updated before the addon is built
    and released.

    That's why this package exists. You can define the metadata and stuff
    like database changes in a JSON file and the file list is created
    automatically. And you don't have to write the XML tags repeatedly.

INSTALLATION PHASES

    When an addon is installed, it happens in several phases

    1 CodeInstall - type "pre"

    2 DatabaseInstall - type "pre"

    3 Files are installed

    4 Include SysConfig

    5 DatabaseInstall - type "post"

    6 CodeInstall - type "post"

    These types are important in some cases and you'll see them later.

CONFIGURATION

    You can configure this command with a JSON file.

 A simple add on

    This configuration file defines only the metadata.

     {
        "name": "Test",
        "version": "0.0.3",
        "framework": [
            "3.0.x"
        ],
        "vendor": {
            "name":  "Perl-Services.de",
            "url": "http://www.perl-services.de"
        },
        "license": "GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 3, November 2007",
        "description" : {
            "en": "Test sopm command"
        }
     }

    And this .sopm will be created (assuming the file exists)

      <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
      <otrs_package version="1.0">
        <!-- GENERATED WITH OPM::Maker::Command::sopm (1.27) -->
        <Name>Test</Name>
        <Version>0.0.3</Version>
        <Framework>3.0.x</Framework>
        <Vendor>Perl-Services.de</Vendor>
        <URL>http://www.perl-services.de</URL>
        <Description Lang="en">Test sopm command</Description>
        <License>GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 3, November 2007</License>
        <Filelist>
            <File Permission="644" Location="01_simple_json.t" />
            <File Permission="644" Location="02_intro.t" />
        </Filelist>
      </otrs>

 Support more than one framework version

    If the module runs on several framework version, you can define them in
    the list of frameworks

        "framework": [
            "3.0.x",
            "3.1.x",
            "3.2.x",
            "3.2.x"
        ],

    And they will all be listed in the .sopm

        <Framework>3.0.x</Framework>
        <Framework>3.1.x</Framework>
        <Framework>3.2.x</Framework>
        <Framework>3.3.x</Framework>

 Required packages and modules

    Some addons depend on other addons and/or Perl modules. So it has to
    define those prerequesits.

        "requires": {
            "package" : {
                "TicketOverviewHooked" : "3.2.1"
            },
            "module" : {
                "Digest::MD5" : "0.01"
            }
        },

    Creates those tags

        <PackageRequired Version="3.2.1">TicketOverviewHooked</PackageRequired>
        <ModuleRequired Version="0.01">Digest::MD5</ModuleRequired>

 Database changes

  Create new table

  Insert stuff

  Change Column

 Code execution

    You can execute code when an addon is installed. As you can see above,
    there are to phases when code can be executed.

  Run "post" code

    Sample config

        "code" : [
            { "type" : "Install" },
            { "type" : "Uninstall" }
        ]

    This creates

        <CodeInstall Type="post"><![CDATA[
            $Kernel::OM->Get('var::packagesetup::' . $Param{Structure}->{Name}->{Content} )->CodeInstall();
        ]]></CodeInstall>
        <CodeUninstall Type="post"><![CDATA[
            $Kernel::OM->Get('var::packagesetup::' . $Param{Structure}->{Name}->{Content} )->CodeUninstall();
        ]]></CodeUninstall>

    You need to provide the var::packagesetup::xxxxx package (where xxxxx
    is the name of the addon).

    There are four types:

      * Install

      * Upgrade

      * Reinstall

      * Uninstall

    The methods called are usually named CodeInstall, CodeUninstall, etc.
    If you need to run an other method, you can specify the method to be
    called:

        "code" : [
            { "type" : "Install", "function": "OtherMethod" }
        ]

    And that would create

        <CodeInstall Type="post"><![CDATA[
            $Kernel::OM->Get('var::packagesetup::' . $Param{Structure}->{Name}->{Content} )->OtherMethod();
        ]]></CodeInstall>

    Usually you would run the code after the files are installed and
    database changes are done. But sometime you need to run code before
    this stuff is done. As the packagesetup file isn't available you, you
    would need to provide the Perl code in the JSON file. That's nasty.
    With inline you can tell this command to get the Perl code from a file.

  Options

      * type

      * version

      * phase

      * function

      * inline
