        [MAYBE JUST POSSIBLY A BREAKING CHANGE]
        - ...but probably not
        - fix the <=> operator to behave more predictably
        - now implemented in terms of ==, <, and >
        - thanks, Karen Etheridge!

1.707     2015-07-17 20:36:41-04:00 America/New_York
        - do not lose a min or max of 0 when intersecting two tolerances
          (thanks, Michael Carman!)

1.706     2015-03-22 12:27:08-04:00 America/New_York
        - do not allow offsets with inverted/broken offset values

1.705     2014-11-16 13:59:01-05:00 America/New_York
        - correct reversed-order of parameters in documentation for
          Test::Tolerant

1.704     2014-10-30 23:11:41-04:00 America/New_York
        - do not rely on feature.pm -- that was an accident

        - overload tolerances for ~~ operator (thanks, Smylers!)

          update bugtracker

          avoid circular loading problems (with a nasty hack)

          fix spelling error; thanks, Alexandre Mestiashvili!

1.701   2010-11-29

        include Test::Tolerant

1.700   2010-08-10
        major changes to support rational numbers via BigRat; n +/- a/b

        refuse to build impossible intersections as previously promised
          (now fatal, as all previous undef-on-failures became in 1.600)

        several "0 treated like undef" bugs fixed

1.601   2008-10-06
        remove tests that non-author testers should not run

1.600   2008-07-30
        Still tolerant after all these years!
        100% test coverage restored

        THIS MAY BREAK YOUR CODE:
        "return undef on error" has been replaced by "throw exception on error"
        ...when creating a tolerance with bogus args
        ...and intersecting a tolerance with a constant outside its range

1.556   2006-06-11
        perl critic, and other minor format/packaging changes

1.555   2006-06-11
        use Sub::Exporter to export

1.540   2006-05-18
        allow more variety in spaces inside parsed tolerance strings

1.52    2006-05-11
        no functional changes
        documentation tweaks, individual module versions updated

1.50    2006-01-27
        large refactoring of types

        greatly expanded test coverage

1.42    2004-12-08
        bump requirements to perl 5.8 (5.6 has an overload bug, it seems)

1.40    2004-12-07
        added end-point exclusion
        rewrote exensibilty as subclassing, like a sane person would
        eliminated most numifications

1.34    2004-08-24 15:45
        minor refactoring of new() to allow extensible non-object returns
        added ::Constant

1.32    2004-08-23 09:25

1.012   2004-07-20 15:35
        add Union.pm
        enable |-overloaded union of ranges

        refactored awful "values" sub (it's still ugly)
        return simple scalars when tolerance == 0
