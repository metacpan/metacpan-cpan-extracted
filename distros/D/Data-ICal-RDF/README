NAME
    Data::ICal::RDF - Turn iCal files into an RDF graph

VERSION
    Version 0.03

SYNOPSIS
        use Data::ICal::RDF;

        # Instantiate a processing context with the appropriate handlers:
        my $context = Data::ICal::RDF->new(
            resolve_uid    => sub {
                # returns an RDF node for the UID...
            },
            resolve_binary => sub {
                # stores a binary object and resolves any relations
                # between it and its supplied file name; returns either an
                # identifier for the content or an identifier for the
                # relation between the name and the content.
            },
        );

        # Process a Data::ICal object...
        $context->process($ical);

        # Successive calls to 'process' against different iCal objects
        # will accumulate statements in the context's internal model.

        # Now you can do whatever you like with the model.
        my $result = $context->model;

DESCRIPTION
    This module is a processor context for turning Data::ICal objects into
    RDF data. By default it uses version 4 (i.e., random) UUIDs as subject
    nodes.

METHODS
  new %PARAMS
    Initialize the processor context.

    resolve_uid
        Supply a callback function to resolve the "UID" property of an iCal
        object. This function *must* return a RDF::Trine::Node::Resource or
        RDF::Trine::Node::Blank. The function is handed:

        1.  The context object itself, meaning the function should be
            written as if it were a mixin of Data::ICal::RDF,

        2.  The "UID" of the iCal entry as a string literal.

        This function is used in "subject_for", which is used by
        "process_events", which is used by "process". If the function is not
        reliable for any reason, such as a failure to access hardware or
        network resources, those methods may "croak".

        By default the processor will automatically convert iCal UIDs which
        are V4 UUIDs into "urn:uuid:" URIs and use them as the subjects of
        the resulting RDF statements. Furthermore, this is checked *before*
        running this function to mitigate any database overhead (see
        "no_uuids"). A V4 UUID URN is also generated as the iCal data's
        subject if this function returns "undef". If you do *not* want to
        use UUIDs, then this function must *always* return a valid value.

        Here is an example of a method in a fictitious class which generates
        a closure suitable to pass into the Data::ICal::RDF constructor:

            sub generate_resolve_uid {
                my $self = shift;
                return sub {
                    my ($data_ical_rdf, $uid) = @_;

                    # magically look up a resource node from some other
                    # data source
                    return $self->lookup_uid($uid);
                };
            }

        This parameter is *required*.

    resolve_binary
        Supply a callback function to handle inline "BINARY" attachments.
        This function *must* return a RDF::Trine::Node::Resource or
        RDF::Trine::Node::Blank. The function is handed:

        1.  The context object itself, meaning the function should be
            written as if it were a mixin of Data::ICal::RDF,

        2.  The binary data as a seekable IO object,

        3.  The *declared* Content-Type of the data (as in you might want to
            verify it using something like File::MMagic or
            File::MimeInfo::Magic),

        4.  The suggested file name, which will already be stripped of any
            erroneous path information. File names of zero length or
            containing only whitespace will not be passed into this
            function, so you need only check if it is "defined".

        This function is used in the "BINARY" type handler in
        "process_events", which is used by "process". Once again, if this
        function is not completely reliable, those methods may "croak".

        Here is an example of a method in a fictitious class which generates
        a closure suitable to pass into the Data::ICal::RDF constructor:

            sub generate_resolve_binary {
                my $self = shift;
                return sub {
                    my ($data_ical_rdf, $io, $type, $name) = @_;

                    # store the content somewhere and get back an identifier
                    my $content_id = $self->store($io, $type);

                    # return the content ID if there is no file name
                    return $content_id unless defined $name;

                    # turn the name into an RDF literal
                    $name = RDF::Trine::Node::Literal->new($name);

                    # now retrieve the subject node that binds the filename
                    # to the content identifier
                    my $subj = $self->get_subject_for($content_id, $name);

                    # now perhaps write the relevant statements back into
                    # the parser context's internal model
                    map { $data_ical_rdf->model->add_statement($_) }
                        for $self->statements_for($content_id, $name);

                    # now we want to return the retrieved *subject*, which
                    # will be passed into the upstream RDF statement
                    # generation function.
                    return $subj;
                };
            }

        This parameter is *required*.

    model
        Supply an RDF::Trine::Model object to use instead of an internal
        temporary model, for direct interface to some other RDF data store.
        Note that this is also accessible through the "model" accessor.

        This parameter is *optional*.

    tz  Supply a "HASH" reference whose keys are *known* iCal "TZID"
        identifiers, and the values are DateTime::TimeZone objects. By
        default, these values are gleaned from the supplied Data::ICal
        objects themselves and *will override* any supplied values.

        This parameter is *optional*.

    no_uuids
        This is a flag to alter the short-circuiting behaviour of
        "subject_for". When set, it will *not* attempt to return the result
        of "uid_is_uuid" before running "resolve_uid".

  process $ICAL
    Process a Data::ICal object and put it into the object's internal model.
    Note that any "VTIMEZONE" objects found will *not* be inserted into the
    model, but rather integrated into the appropriate date/time-like
    property values.

    Note as well that *all* non-standard properties are *ignored*, as well
    as all non-standard property *parameters* with the exception of
    "X-FILENAME" and "X-APPLE-FILENAME" since there is no standard way to
    suggest a file name for attachments.

    This method calls "subject_for" and therefore may croak if the
    "resolve_uid" callback fails for any reason.

  process_events @EVENTS
    Process a list of Data::ICal::Entry::Event objects. This is called by
    "process" and therefore also may croak.

  subject_for $UID
    Take an iCal "UID" property and return a suitable RDF node which can be
    used as a subject. This may call the "resolve_uid" callback and
    therefore may croak if it receives a bad value.

  uuid_is_uid $UID
    Returns a suitable "urn:uuid:" node if the iCal UID is also a valid
    (version 4) UUID. Used by "subject_for" and available in the resolve_uid
    and resolve_binary functions.

  model
    Retrieve the RDF::Trine::Model object embedded in the processor.

CAVEATS
    This module is *prototype-grade*, and may give you unexpected results.
    It does not have a test suite to speak of, at least not until I can come
    up with an adequate one. An exhaustive test suite to handle the vagaries
    of the iCal format would likely take an order of magnitude more effort
    than the module code itself. Nevertheless, I know it works because I'm
    using it, so my "test suite" is production. I repeat, this is *not*
    mature software. Patches welcome.

    Furthermore, a number of iCal datatype handlers are not implemented in
    this early version. These are:

    *   "CAL-ADDRESS"

    *   "DURATION"

    *   "PERIOD"

    *   "RECUR"

    *   "TIME"

    *   "UTC-OFFSET"

    In particular, a lack of a handler for the "DURATION" type means events
    that follow the "DTSTART"/"DURATION" form will be incomplete. In
    practice this should not be a problem, as iCal, Outlook, etc. use
    "DTEND". This is also in part a design issue, as to whether the
    "DURATION" *property* should be normalized to "DTEND".

    As well, the "GEO", "RESOURCES", and "CLASS" properties are yet to be
    implemented. Patches are welcome, as are work orders.
