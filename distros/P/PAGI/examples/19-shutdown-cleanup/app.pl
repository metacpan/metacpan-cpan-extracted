# Cleaning up when the server shuts down.
#
# Each WebSocket connection keeps a little state (here, the messages it
# received). When the connection ends -- the client leaves, or the server
# shuts down -- the app saves that state before it returns. Saving is
# asynchronous (a database, a remote service); the 0.2 s sleep in save_session
# stands in for that latency.
#
# On shutdown the server closes each WebSocket with code 1012 ("Service
# Restart") and reason server_shutdown, waits (up to its shutdown_timeout) for
# each app call to return, and only then sends lifespan.shutdown -- so every
# session is saved before the process exits.
#
# Run:    pagi-server --app examples/19-shutdown-cleanup/app.pl --port 5000
# Try:    websocat ws://127.0.0.1:5000/   (type a few lines), then Ctrl-C the
#         server: each session is saved, then the shutdown summary prints.
