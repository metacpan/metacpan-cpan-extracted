0.08 2015/03/13
  - explicitly use IO::Handle

0.07 2015/03/11
  - requires Exporter 5.57
  - let recurse() accept a single code reference as its argument

0.05 2014/10/10
  - replaced recurse with the code in Path::Extended, which silenced
    "Attempt to free unreferenced scalar" warnings with fork()
    (this was actually an issue of File::Find it used)

0.04 2014/10/07
  - requires IO::Handle 1.25

0.03 2014/09/30
  - fixed a case when an absolute path is passed to file/subdir
    (Unlike Path::Class/Path::Tiny, Path::Extended doesn't simply
    append the path to the original and replaces the original with
    the new absolute path.)
