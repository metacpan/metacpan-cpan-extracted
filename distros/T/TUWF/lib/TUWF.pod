=head1 NAME

TUWF - The Ultimate Website Framework

=head1 DESCRIPTION

TUWF is a small framework designed for writing websites. It provides an
abstraction layer to various environment-specific tasks and has common
functions to ease the creation of both small and large websites.


=head2 Main features and limitations

TUWF may be The Ultimate Website Framework, but it is not the perfect solution
to every problem. This section introduces you to some main features and
limitations you will want to know about before using TUWF.

=over

=item TUWF is small.

I have seen many frameworks being advertised as "small" or "minimal", yet they
either require loads of dependencies or are not small at all. TUWF, on the
other hand, B<is> quite small. Its total codebase is significantly smaller than
the primary code of CGI.pm, and TUWF requires absolutely no extra dependencies
to run.

Some optional features, however, do require extra modules. In order to run TUWF
in a FastCGI environment, the L<FCGI|FCGI> module is required. The
L<TUWF::DB|TUWF::DB> methods require L<DBI|DBI>, and
L<PerlIO::gzip|PerlIO::gzip> is required when you want to enable content
encoding.

=item The generated response is buffered.

This allows you to change the response completely while generating an other
one, which is extremely useful if your code decides to throw an error while a
part of the response has already been generated. In such a case your visitor
will properly see your error page and not some messed up page that does not
make sense. Thanks to this buffering, you will also be able to set cookies and
send other headers B<after> generating the contents of the page.  And as an
added bonus, your pages will be compressed more efficiently when output
compression is enabled.

On the other hand, this means that you can't use TUWF for applications that
require streaming dynamic content (e.g. a chat application), and you may get
into memory issues when sending large files.

=item Everything is UTF-8.

All TUWF functions (with some exceptions) will only accept and return Unicode
strings in Perls native encoding. All incoming data is assumed to be encoded in
UTF-8 and all outgoing data will be encoded in UTF-8. This is generally what
you want when developing new applications. If, for some very strange reason,
you want all I/O with the browser to be in anything other than UTF-8, you won't
be able to use TUWF. It B<is> possible to use external resources which use
other encodings, but you will have to C<decode()> that into Perls native
encoding before passing it to any TUWF function.

=item Designed for CGI and FastCGI environments.

TUWF is designed to be run in CGI and FastCGI environments, and has been
optimized for FastCGI. That is, all modules will be pre-loaded at
initialization.

Due to the singleton design of TUWF, you should avoid running TUWF websites in
persistent environments that allow multiple websites to share the same process,
such as mod_perl.

=item One (sub)domain is one website.

TUWF assumes that the website you are working on resides directly under a
(sub)domain. That is, the homepage of your website has a URI like
I<http://example.com/>, and all sub-pages are directly beneath it. (e.g.
I<http://example.com/about> would be your "about" page).

While it B<is> possible to run a TUWF website in a subdirectory (i.e. the
homepage of the site would be I<http://example.com/mysite/>), you will have to
prefix all HTML links and registered URIs with the name of the subdirectory.
This is neither productive, nor will it be fun when you wish to rename that
directory later on.

=item One website is one (sub)domain.

In the same way as the previous point, TUWF is not made to handle websites that
span multiple (sub)domains and have different behaviour for each one. It is
possible - quite simple, even - to have a different subdomain affect some
configuration parameter while keeping the structure and behaviour of the
website the same as for the other domains. An example of this could be a
language setting embedded in a subdomain: I<en.example.com> could show to the
English version of your site, while I<de.example.com> will have the German
translation.

Things will become messy as soon as you want (sub)domains to behave
differently. If you want I<forum.example.com> to host a forum and
I<wiki.example.com> to be a wiki, you will want to avoid programming both
subdomains in the same TUWF script. A common solution is to write a separate
script for each subdomain. It is still possible to share code among both sites
by means of modules.

=item Backward compatibility is not guaranteed.

TUWF is the result of years of evolution, from one implementation to another
and from one design to another. The reason TUWF has become what it is now is
because of this unconstrained evolution. Providing backward compatibility in
many cases complicates the implementation of new ideas and may add unwanted
bloat to the framework. For this reason, future versions of TUWF may work
differently from older versions, and may not be backward compatible with code
written for an older version.

When using TUWF for your project, it is adviced to get one version of TUWF and
stick to that, until you have time to check out a later version and update your
code to work with that one.

=back



=head2 General structure of a TUWF website

A website written using TUWF consists of a single Perl script, optionally
accompanied by several modules. The script is responsible for loading,
initializing and running TUWF, and can be used as a CGI or FastCGI script. For
small and simple websites, this script may contain the code for the entire
website. Usually, however, the actual implementation of the website is spread
among the various modules.

The script can load the modules by calling C<TUWF::load()> or
C<TUWF::load_recursive()>. TUWF configuration variables can be set using
C<TUWF::set()>, and URIs can be mapped to functions using C<TUWF::register()>.
These functions can also be called by the loaded modules. In fact, for larger
websites it is common for the script to only initialize TUWF and load the
modules, while all calls to C<TUWF::register()> are done from the modules.

The framework is based on callbacks: At initialization, your code registers
callbacks to the framework and then passes the control to TUWF using
C<TUWF::run()>. TUWF will then handle requests and call the appropriate
functions you registered.


=head2 The TUWF Object

While TUWF can not really be called I<object oriented>, it does use B<one>
major object, called the I<TUWF object>. This object can be accessed from
C<$TUWF::OBJ> and is passed as the first argument to all callback functions.
Even though it is an "instance" of C<TUWF::Object>, you are encouraged to use
it as if it is the main object for your website: You can use it to store global
configuration settings and other shared data.

All modules loaded using C<TUWF::load()> and its recursive counterpart can
export functions; These functions are automatically imported in the
C<TUWF::Object> namespace and can be used as methods of the TUWF object. This
allows for an easy method to split the functionality of your website among
different functions and files, without having to constantly load and import
your utility modules in each file that uses them.

Of course, with all exported functions being imported into a single namespace,
this does call for some function naming conventions to avoid name conflicts and
other confusing issues. The main TUWF methods use camelCase and are often
prefixed with a short identifier to indicate to which module or section they
belong. For example, the L<TUWF::Request|TUWF::Request> methods all start with
C<req> and L<TUWF::Response|TUWF::Response> with C<res>. It is a good idea to
adopt this style when you write your own methods.

Be warned that the data in the TUWF object may or may not persist among
multiple requests, depending on whether your script is running in FastCGI or
CGI mode, respectively. In particular, it is a bad idea to store session data
in this object, assuming it to be available on the next request. Storing data
specific to a single request in the object is fine, as long as you make sure to
reset or re-initialize the data at the beginning of the request. The
C<pre_request_handler> is useful for such practice.


=head2 Utility functions

Besides the above mentioned methods, TUWF also provides various handy
functions. These functions are implemented in the TUWF submodules (e.g.
L<TUWF::Misc|TUWF::Misc>) and can be imported manually through these modules.
Check out the L<SEE ALSO|/"SEE ALSO"> below for the list of submodules.

An alternative, and more convenient, approach to importing these functions into
your code is also available: you can import functions from multiple submodules
at once by adding their names and/or tags to the C<use TUWF;> line.

The following two examples are equivalent:

  # the simple approach
  use TUWF ':xml', 'uri_escape', 'sqlprint';

  # the classic approach
  use TUWF;
  use TUWF::XML ':xml';
  use TUWF::Misc 'uri_escape';
  use TUWF::DB 'sqlprint';

The first C<use TUWF;> line of the classic approach is not required if all you
need is to import the functions. Omitting this line from your main website
script, however, will cause the main TUWF code to not be loaded into memory,
and the global functions (listed below) will then not be available. The simple
approach does not suffer from this problem and is therefore recommended.




=head1 GLOBAL FUNCTIONS

The main TUWF namespace contains several functions used to initialize the
framework and register the callbacks for your website.

=head2 TUWF::load(@modules)

Loads the listed module names and imports their exported functions to the
C<TUWF::Object> namespace. The modules must be available in any subdirectory in
C<@INC>.

  # make sure the website modules are available from @INC
  use lib 'mylib';
  
  # load mylib/MyWebsite/HomePage.pm
  TUWF::load('MyWebsite::HomePage');
  
  # load two other modules
  TUWF::load('MyWebsite::Forum', 'MyUtilities');

Note that your modules must be proper Perl modules. That is, they should return
a true value (usually done by adding C<1;> to the end of the file) and they
should have the correct namespace definition.

=head2 TUWF::load_recursive(@modules)

Works the same as C<TUWF::load()>, but this also loads all submodules.

  # the following will load MyWebsite.pm (if it exists) and all modules below
  # the MyWebsite/ directory (if any).
  TUWF::load_recursive('MyWebsite');

Note that all submodules must be in the same parent directory in C<@INC>.

=head2 TUWF::register(regex => subroutine, ..)

Maps a URI to a function. The I<regex> is matched to L<reqPath()|TUWF::Request>
and must match the path from the begin to the end.  (That is, the regex is used
between C<^> and C<$> marks). The leading slash of the path is removed before
matching, so these should be omitted in the regexes. It is common to use the
C<qr{}> operator to quote the regex, which prevents you from having to escape
slashes in the path as would be required with C<qr//>.

All registered regexes are matched against any incoming URI, and the subroutine
corresponding to the first matched regex will be called to handle the request.
The first argument to the subroutine will be the main TUWF object. If the
regular expression has capture buffers, these will also be provided as
additional arguments.

  TUWF::register(
    # empty regex = root URI (/)
    # myhomepage() will be called with the main TUWF object
    qr{}  => \&myhomepage,
  
    # The following will match on any /user/<numeric-id> URI.
    # userpage() will be called with
    # - the TUWF object and
    # - the id-part of the URI ($1 in the regular expression)
    qr{user/(\d+)} => \&userpage,
  );

=head2 TUWF::set(key => value, ..)

Get or set TUWF configuration variables. When called with only one argument,
will return the configuration variable with that key. Otherwise the number of
arguments must be a multiple of 2, setting the configuration parameters.

=over

=item content_encoding

Set the default output encoding. Supported values are I<none>, I<gzip>,
I<deflate>, I<auto>. See L<TUWF::Response|TUWF::Response> for more information.
Default: auto.

=item cookie_defaults

When set to a hashref, will be used as the default options to
L<resCookie()|TUWF::Response>. These options can still be overruled by each
individual call to C<resCookie()>. This can be useful when globally setting the
cookie domain:

  $self->set(cookie_defaults => { domain => '.example.org' });
  $self->resCookie(foo => 'bar');
  
  # is equivalent to:
  $self->resCookie(foo => 'bar', domain => '.example.org');
  # for each call to resCookie()

Default: undef (disabled).

=item cookie_prefix

When set to a non-empty string, its value will be used as prefix to all cookie
names used by C<reqCookie()> and C<resCookie()>. C<reqCookie()> will act as if
all cookies not having the configured prefix never existed, and removes the
prefix when used in list context. C<resCookie()> will simply add the prefix to
all outgoing cookies. Default: undef (disabled).

=item db_login

Sets the login information for the L<TUWF::DB|TUWF::DB> functions. Can be set
to either an arrayref or a subroutine reference.

In the case of an arrayref, the array should have three elements, containing
the first three arguments to C<DBI::connect()>. Do not include the last options
argument, TUWF will set the appropriate options itself. When necessary,
however, it is still possible to set options using the DSN string itself, see
the L<DBI|DBI> documentation for more information. C<TUWF::DB> will
automatically enable the unicode/utf8 flag for C<DBD::mysql>, C<DBD::Pg> and
C<DBD::SQLite>.

When setting this to a subroutine reference, the subroutine will be called when
connecting to the database, with the main TUWF object as only argument. The
subroutine is expected to return a DBI instance. It is the responsibility of
the subroutine to set the correct DBI options. In particular, it is important
to have I<RaiseError> enabled and I<AutoCommit> disabled. It is also
recommended to enable unicode support if your database driver has such an
option.

Default: undef (disabled).

=item debug

Set to a true value to enable debug mode. When debug mode is enabled and
I<logfile> is specified, TUWF will log page generation times for each request.
This flag can be easily read through the C<debug()> method, so you can also use
is in your own code. Default: 0 (disabled).

=item error_400_handler

Similar to I<error_404_handler>, but is called when something in the request
data did not make sense to TUWF. In the current implementation, this only
happens when the request data contains non-UTF8-encoded text. A warning is
written to the log file when this happens.

=item error_404_handler

Set this to a subroutine reference if you want to write your own 404 error
page. The subroutine will be called with TUWF object as only argument, and is
expected to generate a response.

=item error_405_handler

Similar to I<error_404_handler>, but is called when the HTTP request method is
something other than HEAD, GET or POST. These requests are usually generated by
bots or applications which don't actually read the response contents, so
overriding the default 405 error page makes little sense in most situations. If
you do override it, do not forget to add an C<Allow> HTTP header to the
response, as required by the HTTP standard.

=item error_413_handler

Similar to I<error_404_handler>, but is called when the POST body exceeds the
configured I<max_post_body>.

=item error_500_handler

Set this to a subroutine reference if you want to write your own 500 error
page. The subroutine will be called with the TUWF object as first argument and
the error message as second argument. When I<logfile> is set, a detailed error
report will be written to the log. It is recommended to ignore the error
message passed to your subroutine and to enable the log file, so you won't risk
sending sensitive information to your visitors.

=item logfile

To enable logging, set this to a string that indicates the path to your log
file. The file must of course be writable by your script. TUWF automatically
logs all Perl warnings, and when one of your callbacks throws an exception a
full request dump with useful information will be logged, allowing you to
easily locate and fix the problem. You can also write information to the log
yourself using the C<log()> method. Default: undef (disabled).

=item log_format

Set to a subroutine reference to influence the default log format. The
subroutine is passed three arguments: the main TUWF object, the URI of the
current request (or '[init]' if C<log()> was called outside of a request), and
the log message. The subroutine should return the string to be written to the
log, including trailing newline.

Be warned that your subroutine can be called even when no request is being
processed or before some resources have been initialized, so you should avoid
using such resources. In paticular, do not call any database functions from
this subroutine, as the database connection may not be in a defined state. Any
Perl warnings generated by this subroutine will not be logged in order to avoid
infinite recursion.

=item log_slow_pages

Setting this to a number will log all pages that took longer to generate than
the time indicated in the number, in milliseconds. The format of the log line
is the same as used when the I<debug> option is enabled. This option is ignored
when I<debug> is enabled, since in that case all pages will be logged anyway.
Default: 0 (disabled).

=item log_queries

Setting this to a true value will write all database queries to the log file.
Useful when debugging queries, but can generate a lot of data. Default: 0
(disabled).

=item mail_from

The default value of the C<From:> header of mail sent using
L<mail()|TUWF::Misc>. Default: C<E<lt>noreply-yawf@blicky.netE<gt>>.

=item mail_sendmail

The path to the C<sendmail> command, used by L<mail()|TUWF::Misc>. Default:
C</usr/sbin/sendmail>.

=item max_post_body

Maximum length of the contents of POST requests, in bytes. This disallows
people to upload large files and potentially cause your script to run out of
memory. Set to 0 to disable this limit. Default: 10MB.

=item pre_request_handler

Set to a subroutine reference if you want to perform some actions before TUWF
calls your URI handling function. The subroutine B<must> return a true value to
indicate that TUWF can continue processing the request as usual. If the
subroutine returns false, TUWF will assume the subroutine has generated a
response and will halt any further processing. This callback is often used
for initializing or resetting request-specific data, and parsing cookies or
other request data to set preferences or session information.

=item post_request_handler

Similar to I<post_request_handler>, except it will be called after the request
has been processed but before it has been sent to the client. This callback
will not be called if any of the functions before threw an exception.

=item validate_templates

Hashref, templates for the L<kv_validate()|TUWF::Misc> function when called
using L<formValidate()|TUWF::Misc>. The recommended way to add new templates is
to call C<TUWF::set()> with a single argument:

  TUWF::set('validate_templates')->{$key} = \%validate_options;

=item xml_pretty

Passed to the I<pretty> option of C<TUWF::XML-E<gt>new()>. See
L<TUWF::XML|TUWF::XML>. Default: 0 (disabled).

=back

=head2 TUWF::run()

After TUWF has been initialized, all modules have been loaded and all URIs have
been registered, the last thing that remains is to execute C<TUWF::run()>. This
function will start processing requests and calls the appropriate callbacks at
the appropriate stages.

Whether this function ever returns or not depends on the environment your
script is running in; if you're running your script in a CGI environment,
C<TUWF::run()> will return as soon as the request has been processed. If, on
the other hand, you are running the script as a FastCGI script, it will keep
waiting for new incoming requests and will therefore never return. It is a bad
idea to assume either way, so you want to avoid putting any run-time code after
calling C<TUWF::run()>.



=head1 BASIC METHODS

This section documents the basic TUWF object methods provided by TUWF.pm. The
TUWF object provides many other methods as well, which are implemented and
documented in the various sub-modules. See the documentation of each sub-module
for the methods it provides.

=head2 debug()

Returns the value of the I<debug> setting.

=head2 log(message)

Writes a message to the log file configured with I<logfile>. When no log file
is configured, C<log()> will do nothing. The I<message> argument may contain
newlines, which will be nicely (re-)formatted before logging, in order to avoid
ambiguity with other log entries. By default the log message will be prefixed
with the date and URI of the request, but this can be changed with the
L<log_format|/log_format> setting.

This function is not used very often in practice, since it is easier to simply
use Perl's C<warn()> function instead. TUWF automatically writes all warnings
to the log file.



=head1 SERVER CONFIGURATION

Since a website written using TUWF consists of a single Perl script that acts
as the main script for your site, the only thing you have to do is tell your
webserver to run it. There are generally two things you should take care of:

=over

=item 1.

You can run the script as CGI or FastCGI script. In the case of FastCGI, you
will need the L<FCGI|FCGI> module.

=item 2.

You have to make sure all requests to non-existing files are passed to your
script, in order for the URI rewriting in TUWF to work.

=back

The following examples show how to configure your server to run the
C<examples/singlefile.pl> script from the TUWF distribution. I assume the TUWF
distribution is unpacked in C</tuwf> and the site runs on the hostname
C<test.example.com>.

=head2 Examples for Apache (2.2)

CGI mode:

  <VirtualHost *:*>
    ServerName test.example.com
    DocumentRoot /tuwf/examples
    AddHandler cgi-script .pl

    # %{REQUEST_FILENAME} does not seem to always work inside a <VirtualHost>
    # But it should be equivalent to "%{DOCUMENT_ROOT}/%{REQUEST_URI}"
    RewriteEngine On
    RewriteCond "%{DOCUMENT_ROOT}/%{REQUEST_URI}" !-s
    RewriteRule ^/ /singlefile.pl
  </VirtualHost>

It is possible to move the mod_rewrite statements into a .htaccess file, in
which case you can remove the C<Rewrite*> lines in the above example and put
the following in your .htaccess file:

  RewriteEngine On
  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-s
  RewriteRule ^/ /singlefile.pl

FastCGI mode, using C<mod_fcgid>. With this configuration it is possible to
have the documentroot point to a different directory than where the TUWF script
resides, which could improve security.

  <VirtualHost *:*>
    ServerName test.example.com
    DocumentRoot /whatever/you/want
    AddHandler fcgid-script .pl
    FcgidWrapper /tuwf/examples/singlefile.pl virtual

    # same as above example, except 'singlefile.pl' can be anything,
    # as long as it ends with '.pl'
    RewriteEngine On
    RewriteCond "%{DOCUMENT_ROOT}/%{REQUEST_URI}" !-s
    RewriteRule ^/ /singlefile.pl
  </VirtualHost>

Again, it is possible to move the rewrites into a .htaccess. All of the above
examples assume the referenced directories have the appropriate options set
using a C<E<lt>DirectoryE<gt>> clause.


=head2 Examples for lighttpd (1.4)

CGI mode:

  $HTTP["host"] == "test.example.com" {
    server.document-root = "/tuwf/examples"
    cgi.assign = ( ".cgi" => "" )
    server.error-handler-404 = "/singlefile.pl"
  }

FastCGI:

  fastcgi.server = (
    ".singlefile" => ((
      "socket"            => "/tmp/perl-tuwf-singlefile.socket",
      "bin-path"          => "/tuwf/examples/singlefile.pl",
      "check-local"       => "disable"
    ))
  )

  $HTTP["host"] == "test.example.com" {
    server.document-root = "/whatever/you/want"
    cgi.assign = ( ".cgi" => "" )
    server.error-handler-404 = "/something.singlefile"
  }
