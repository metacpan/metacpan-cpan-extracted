        uri     => 'http://metabase.example.com/',

DESCRIPTION
    Metabase::Client::Simple provides is extremely simple, lightweight
    library for submitting facts to a Metabase web server.

METHODS
  new
      my $client = Metabase::Client::Simple->new(\%arg)

    This is the object constructor.

    Valid arguments are:

      profile - a Metabase::User::Profile object
      secret  - a Metabase::User::Secret object
      uri     - the root URI for the metabase server

    If you use a "uri" argument with the 'https' scheme, you must have
    IO::Socket::SSL and Net::SSLeay installed. You may also require
    Mozilla::CA.

  submit_fact
      $client->submit_fact($fact);

    This method will submit a Metabase::Fact object to the client's server.
    On success, it will return a true value. On failure, it will raise an
    exception.

  guid_exists
      $client->guid_exists('2f8519c6-24cf-11df-90b1-0018f34ec37c');

    This method will check whether the given GUID is found on the metabase
    server. The GUID must be in lower-case, string form. It will return true
    or false. Note that a server error will also result in a false value.

  register
      $client->register;

    This method will submit the user credentials to the metabase server. It
    will be called automatically by "submit_fact" if necessary. You
    generally won't need to use it. On success, it will return a true value.
    On failure, it will raise an exception.
