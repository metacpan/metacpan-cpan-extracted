            * Fix broken compilation on linux.

0.000011    2019-04-05
            * Fix conversion of large integers from Perl to JS.
            * Hide some undesired warnings.

0.000010    2019-03-04
            * Support sending cyclic data to the console.
            * Update ppport.h to 3.43.
            * Improve docs.

0.000009    2018-10-31
            * Support passing Perl objects with magic into JS.
            * If perl sub dies, handle by dying.

0.000008    2018-09-11
            * Treat references with more care:
              + Recursively dereference any references.
              + For \0 and \1, convert into false and true.
              + For any other references, use the underlying data.
            * Allow passing blessed objects to JS and back; ignore the fact
              that they are blessed and treat them as data.
            * Improve tests.

0.000007    2018-09-10
            * Bring back dispatch_function_in_event_loop() to have an easy
              migration path from this to eval(); we will remove it soon.
            * Make stacktraces more similar between Duktape and V8.

0.000006    2018-08-28
            * Convert JS booleans into JSON::PP::Boolean objects.
              This allows us to roundtrip, especially for cases such as
              reading a JSON file in JS (which will likely use booleans)
              and passing that to / from Perl.
            * Get rid of dispatch_function_in_event_loop().  It is
              actually better that calling eval() always tries to
              dispatch any pending timers after running the requested code.
            * Fixed wrong references to Duktape.

0.000005    2018-07-27

            * Clean up and expand perldoc.
