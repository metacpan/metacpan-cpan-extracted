                      User-Visible PGP::Sign Changes

PGP::Sign 1.03 (2020-09-12)

    Document that GnuPG 2.1.23 or GnuPG 1.4.20 or later is required and
    skip tests on platforms that do not meet those version requirements.
    The alternative would be auto-discovery of which command-line flags to
    use and these version requirements are met by Debian stable (and
    Debian oldstable with backports), so hopefully this restriction will
    not cause too much hardship.

PGP::Sign 1.02 (2020-08-29)

    On systems where gpg is GnuPG v1, override the path to the gpg binary
    in the test suite.  Some tests were still incorrectly looking for a
    gpg1 binary.

    On systems where gpg as found on the PATH is GnuPG v2 but is older
    than 2.1.12 and therefore doesn't support the command-line arguments
    PGP::Sign uses, skip the relevant tests.  Tests are skipped rather
    than failed because this doesn't represent a problem with the module
    and the module can still be used with explicit configuration pointing
    to a different version of GnuPG.

PGP::Sign 1.01 (2020-07-18)

    Fix test suite to pass on systems where gpg is GnuPG v1.  This is
    apparently still common among many CPAN tester machines, and thus
    probably other systems in the wild.  This does not change the module's
    default behavior; systems using GnuPG v1 still need to pass an
    explicit style => 'GPG1' argument to the PGP::Sign constructor.

    Update to rra-c-util 8.3:

    * Fix style issues caught by Perl::Critic::Freenode.
    * Ignore debian/changelog when checking for obsolete strings.

PGP::Sign 1.00 (2020-06-27)

    Drop support for all PGP implementations other than GnuPG.  I haven't
    seen a working copy of the old commercial PGP implementations in years
    and no longer have any way to test PGP::Sign with them.

    Require a minimum Perl version of 5.20 and stop attempting to support
    versions of Perl back to 5.003, which are now impossible to test with
    and are missing many modern Perl features.

    Add a new object-oriented API.  This avoids global variables and
    global state, provides a simpler API that doesn't require or support
    the now-obsolete version string, and calls croak on errors.  The
    legacy API of pgp_sign, pgp_verify, and pgp_error is still supported
    but is now implemented in terms of the object-oriented API.  The new
    API should be used for all new code.

    Add support for GnuPG v2.  GnuPG v2 is chosen by setting the style
    constructor parameter or $PGP::Sign::PGPSTYLE to "GPG", which is now
    the default.  Be aware that GnuPG v2 does not support creating
    signatures that can be verified with PGP 2.6.2.  To support older keys
    and signatures, set the style constructor parameter or
    $PGP::Sign::PGPSTYLE to "GPG1", which uses GnuPG v1 configured to be
    backward-compatible with PGP 2.6.2.

    Status output from GnuPG is now kept separate from human-readable log
    and error output for more reliable parsing.  This will change the
    order of GnuPG output in reported error messages.  The human-readable
    output will always be first, followed by the status messages.

    Pass --allow-weak-digest-algos to GnuPG so it can use old keys and
    verify signatures from old keys, such as those created with PGP 2.6.2.

    pgp_sign, when called in array context, now always returns "GnuPG" as
    the version string, and the version passed into pgp_verify is always
    ignored.  Including the OpenPGP implementation version information in
    signatures is obsolete; GnuPG no longer does it by default and it
    serves no useful purpose.

    When calling pgp_sign multiple times in the same process with
    whitespace munging enabled, trailing whitespace without a newline
    could have leaked into the next invocation of pgp_sign, resulting in
    an invalid signature.  Clear any remembered whitespace between
    pgp_sign invocations.

    PGP::Sign now depends on IPC::Run and uses it to talk to GnuPG instead
    of hand-rolling equivalent functionality with IPC::Open3.

    Use File::Temp to create temporary files.  This should significantly
    improve the safety of temporary file creation.  The default directory
    for temporary file creation is now whatever directory File::Temp
    chooses by default.  It can stll be overridden by setting the tmpdir
    constructor parameter or $PGP::Sign::TMPDIR.

    Rewrite the build system to use Module::Build.  This eliminates the
    spurious VERSION.pm "module" at the top level, which was a hack for
    setting the distribution version in old versions of
    ExtUtils::MakeMaker and should improve the indexing of the module.
    Move the module into a lib structure and the test suite data into
    t/data.  Eliminate all of the prompting and command-line parameters to
    set the PGP style and path to programs; instead, PGP::Sign will
    default to using gpg1 from the user's PATH.

    Rewrite ChangeLog into a more conventional Changes file.

PGP::Sign 0.20 (2007-04-27)

    Unbuffer output when building the module since there is an interactive
    prompt.

PGP::Sign 0.19 (2004-08-08)

    Replace verification code for GnuPG with code that uses --status-fd,
    so that it will work independent of locale.

    Document limitations in the error reporting and recommended setting
    TMPDIR.

PGP::Sign 0.18 (2004-08-04)

    Remove trustdb.gpg from the distribution and add it to the files
    cleaned by make clean.

PGP::Sign 0.17 (2002-06-28)

    Skip the test for verification of data with trailing whitespace when
    run under GnuPG, since the whitespace behavior changes fromr elease to
    release.  GnuPG 1.0.2 is back to the previous behavior of releases
    before GnuPG 1.0.1.

    Update CAVEATS to be slightly less optimistic about the chances of a
    major overhaul.  Add a URL for RFC 2440 and this module's web site.
    Add a COPYRIGHT AND LICENSE section.  Update the markup in the
    documentation.

PGP::Sign 0.16 (2000-02-12)

    Add support for PGP 6.5, including a new PGPSTYLE setting.

    Add a waitpid call to pgp_verify() to avoid leaving zombies behind.

    Document the change in trailing whitespace handling in GnuPG 1.0.1.

PGP::Sign 0.15 (1999-06-13)

    Clear the close-on-exec flag on the passphrase pipe in pgp_sign(),
    required for Perl 5.005_03.

    Document that PGP may want to write randseed.bin to its keyring
    directory when run.

PGP::Sign 0.14 (1999-02-10)

    Add support for GnuPG and PGP 5.0.  This includes a new PGPSTYLE
    global variable, support for separate programs for signing and
    verification and lots of choosing between styles all over the code.
    Document the incompatibilities between different versions with respect
    to whitespace munging.

    Add support for passing overrides for PGP paths and PGPSTYLE
    configuration settings via a paths file in the top-level directory
    instead of on the command line of makepm.PL.

PGP::Sign 0.13 (1998-12-04)

    Allow setting the path to PGP on the command line when running perl
    Makefile.PL.

PGP::Sign 0.12 (1998-12-02)

    Ensure the path to PGP input by the user during the build process
    overrides any other path to PGP found by the build system.

PGP::Sign 0.11 (1998-11-27)

    Prevent ExtUtils::MakeMaker from spuriously generating a
    PGP::PGP::Sign man page.

    Add ABSTRACT and AUTHOR to Makefile.PL for Perl versions 5.005 and
    higher.

PGP::Sign 0.10 (1998-11-26)

    Fix a bug in finding the PGP version number of a signature.

    Add support for the $PGP::Sign::PGPPATH configuration variable.

    Clean up and reformat the documentation, add information about PGP
    environment variables, and document the lack of support for PGP v5 and
    GnuPG.

    Add a test suite.

PGP::Sign 0.9 (1998-07-05)

    Fix the code for getting the exit status of PGP to call waitpid on a
    specific PID, avoiding getting the status of some other child
    process.

    Explicitly set $/ in case the calling program had it set to something
    odd.

PGP::Sign 0.8 (1997-08-18)

    Explicitly set a umask of 077 in pgp_verify() (and restore it on
    completion) since we're creating temporary files.

    Add a check to pgp_sign() to make sure we got a signature.

PGP::Sign 0.7 (1997-08-15)

    Use O_EXCL when opening files in /tmp to avoid symlink attacks.

PGP::Sign 0.6 (1997-08-15)

    Add support for $PGP::Sign::MUNGE, which says to remove trailing
    whitespace from each line before passing it to PGP.

PGP::Sign 0.5 (1997-07-28)

    Fix some minor documentation nits.

PGP::Sign 0.4 (1997-07-28)

    Change signature verification code to verify detached signatures
    instead of attached ones, and add a $PGP::Sign::TMPDIR variable to
    specify where the temporary files should be created.

    Remove support for $PGP::Sign::ORS, which was a hack that's no longer
    necessary.  Adding newlines before the signature can be done by the
    caller of the module.

    Add a pgp_error() function to retrieve the error message from the last
    command.

PGP::Sign 0.3 (1997-07-27)

    Add pgp_verify().

PGP::Sign 0.2 (1997-07-27)

    Use @PGP::Sign::ERROR correctly to store errors from pgp_sign().

    Add documentation.

    Fix some minor bugs.

PGP::Sign 0.1 (1997-07-27)

    Initial version, only supporting signature creation.
