                        CM+ has several dozen commands that can
                    be used both for operation and configuration of the product.
                    As CM+ is change-based, commands are substantially
                    different than CVS.  The GUI is used primarily and implemented
                    on top of the command set.  As well, CM+ covers a full ALM
                    suite and can be extended beyond, so there are many more
                    generic commands for browsing, reporting, etc.
