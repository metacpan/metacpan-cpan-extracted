NAME

    Test::RequiredMinimumDependencyVersion - Require a minimum version for
    your dependencies

VERSION

    Version 0.002

SYNOPSIS

        use Test::RequiredMinimumDependencyVersion;
        Test::RequiredMinimumDependencyVersion->new(module => { ... })->all_files_ok;

DESCRIPTION

    There are some modules where you'll always depend on a minimal version,
    either because of a bug or because of an API change. A good example
    would be Test::More where version 0.88 introduced done_testing() or
    version which strongly urges to set 0.77 as a minimum in your code.

    This test can be used to check that, whenever you use these modules,
    you also declare the minimum version.

    This test is an author test and should not run on end-user
    installations. Recommendation is to put it into your xt instead of your
    t directory.

USAGE

 new( ARGS )

    Returns a new Test::RequiredMinimumDependencyVersion instance. new
    takes a hash with its arguments.

        Test::RequiredMinimumDependencyVersion->new(
            module => {
                'Test::More' => '0.88',
            },
        );

    The following arguments are supported:

  module (required)

    The module argument is a hash ref where the keys are the modules you
    want to enforce and the minimal version is its value.

 file_ok( FILENAME )

    This will run a test for parsing the file with Perl::PrereqScanner and
    another test for every module you specified if it is used in this file.
    It is therefore unlikely to know the exact number of tests that will
    run in advance. Use done_testing from Test::More if you call this test
    directly instead of a plan.

    file_ok returns something true if all checked dependencies are at least
    of the required minimal version and false otherwise.

 all_files_ok( [ @entries ] )

    Checks all the files under @entries by calling file_ok on every file.
    Directories are recursive searched for files. Everything not a file and
    not a directory (e.g. a symlink) is ignored. It calls done_testing or
    skip_all so you can't have already called plan.

    If @entries is empty default directories are searched for files. The
    default directories are blib, or lib if it doesn't exist, bin and
    script.

    all_files_ok returns something true if all files test ok and false
    otherwise.

EXAMPLES

 Example 1 Default Usage

    Check all files in the bin, script and lib directory.

        use 5.006;
        use strict;
        use warnings;

        use Test::RequiredMinimumDependencyVersion;

        Test::RequiredMinimumDependencyVersion->new(
            module => {
                'version' => '0.77',
            },
        )->all_files_ok;

 Example 2 Check non-default directories or files

        use 5.006;
        use strict;
        use warnings;

        use Test::RequiredMinimumDependencyVersion;

        Test::RequiredMinimumDependencyVersion->new(
            module => {
                'Test::More' => '0.88',
                'version'    => '0.77',
            },
        )->all_files_ok(qw(bin lib t xt corpus/hello_world.pl));

 Example 3 Call file_ok directly

        use 5.006;
        use strict;
        use warnings;

        use Test::More 0.88;
        use Test::RequiredMinimumDependencyVersion;

        my $trmdv = Test::RequiredMinimumDependencyVersion->new(
            module => {
                'Test::More' => '0.88',
            },
        );
        $trmdv->file_ok('t/00-load.t');
        $trmdv->file_ok('xt/author/pod-links.t');

        done_testing();
