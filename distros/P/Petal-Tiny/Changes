Revision history for Perl extension Petal::Tiny

1.16      2015-05-13 15:32:32+02:00 Europe/Copenhagen
        - Release without nytprof files...
1.15      2015-05-13 15:27:50+02:00 Europe/Copenhagen
        - Fixed issue with recognizing single-character tags, e.g. "<p>".
        - Fixed issue with matching multiline tags, e.g. "<foo\n>".
        - Better error message when reporting on close tags not matching start tags.
1.14      2015-05-12 15:51:56+02:00 Europe/Copenhagen
        - Lots and lots of optimizations, much faster now.
          Given a large benchmark, Devel::NYTProf reports:
                1.13  "Executed 2158858 statements in 3.19s"
                1.14  "Executed 454786 statements in 463ms"
        - Fix the value '0' getting turned into the empty string in the
          expression engine
        - Use same quote-char for attributes as was in original html
          (instead of forcing "").
1.13      2014-11-12 14:35:53+01:00 Europe/Copenhagen
        - fixed old bug in tal_condition relating to anding ;-seperated values
1.12      2014-11-12 12:11:45+01:00 Europe/Copenhagen
        - dollar interpolation now warns the expression when you try to interpolate undef
1.11      2014-10-06 13:49:57+02:00 Europe/Copenhagen
        - make string: use the same $-interpolation as the one for the xml.
          (Which actually fixes the problem mentioned below.)
1.10      2014-10-03 15:28:31+02:00 Europe/Copenhagen
        - fix '${}' to match documentation. Now '${' will eat everything
          up to the '}', allowing
                string:The current CGI 'action' param is: ${cgi/param --action}

          '${foo' (without any '}') and '$foo}' will still interpolate foo (and eat the '}').

1.09      2014-08-06 14:17:32+02:00 Europe/Copenhagen
        - allow tal:repeat to loop over a single element
        - add nested looping to tal:repeat

1.08      2014-08-04 13:28:23+02:00 Europe/Copenhagen
        - never try to xmlencode references!
          (Actual issue for Mojolicious::Plugin::PetalTinyRenderer,
          since Mojo::Collection stringifies, so if a Mojo::Collection
          contained a string that needed encoding, it would turn into
          a string...)

1.07      2014-07-31 16:04:13+02:00 Europe/Copenhagen
        - refactored expression internals to pass around $self, to
          make it possible to subclass Petal::Tiny.
        - added reftype method, to make it easier to add support for
          blessed references that you actually want to treat like
          e.g. array references (like Mojo::Collection). (This could
          be conceptually purer, but is "good enough" for what i want;
          patches welcome).

1.06      2014-06-28 09:53:19CEST+0200 Europe/Copenhagen
        - mocked CGI in regression test, since CGI moved out of core in 5.21+.
          Thanks, cpantesters!

1.05      2014-06-26 14:27:55+02:00 Europe/Copenhagen

        - added + feature to tal:attributes to append to existing attributes
