0.007_02  2023-08-16 12:44:24 UTC

  - get() now returns 2 additional values, a Path::Tiny object for the
    files containing stdout and stderr from git.
  - added 2 new methods, path_stderr, and path_stdout.

0.007  2023-08-05 12:30:25 UTC

    the output from git.

0.005  2022-04-03 16:05:30 UTC

  - Use Git::Background::Future->fail instead of Future->fail when
    Proc::Background fails. Otherwise mthods like stdout() wouldn't be
    available on these errors but on others, which would be confusing.
