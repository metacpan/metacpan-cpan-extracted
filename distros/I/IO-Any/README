NAME
    IO::Any - open anything

SYNOPSIS
        # NOTE commented out lines doesn't work (yet)
        use IO::Any;

        $fh = IO::Any->read('filename');
        $fh = IO::Any->read('file://var/log/syslog');
        #$fh = IO::Any->read('http://search.cpan.org/');
        #$fh = IO::Any->read('-');
        $fh = IO::Any->read(['folder', 'other-folder', 'filename']);
        $fh = IO::Any->read('folder');
        $fh = IO::Any->read("some text\nwith more lines\n");
        $fh = IO::Any->read(\"some text\nwith more lines\n");
        $fh = IO::Any->read('{"123":[1,2,3]}');
        $fh = IO::Any->read('<root><element>abc</element></root>');
        $fh = IO::Any->read(*DATA);
        $fh = IO::Any->read(IO::String->new("cba"));
        #$fh = IO::Any->read($object_with_toString_method);

        $fh = IO::Any->write('filename');
        $fh = IO::Any->write('file://var/log/syslog');
        #$fh = IO::Any->write('-');
        $fh = IO::Any->write(['folder', 'filename']);
        #$fh = IO::Any->write('=');
        my $string;
        $fh = IO::Any->write(\$string);

        my $content = IO::Any->slurp(['folder', 'filename']);
        IO::Any->spew(['folder2', 'filename'], $content);

        perl -MIO::Any -le 'print IO::Any->slurp("/etc/passwd")'
        perl -MIO::Any -le 'IO::Any->spew("/tmp/timetick", time())'

DESCRIPTION
    The aim is to provide read/write anything. The module tries to guess
    `$what' the "anything" is based on some rules. See new method Pod for
    examples and the new and _guess_what entries elsewhere in this document
    code for the implementation.

    There are two methods the slurp and spew entries elsewhere in this
    document to read/write whole `$what'.

MOTIVATION
    The purpose is to be able to use IO::Any in other modules that needs to
    read or write data. The description for an argument could be - pass
    anything that IO::Any accepts as argument - GLOBs, IO::File,
    Path::Class::File, IO::AtomicFile, IO::String, pointers to scalar and
    pointer to array (array elements are passed to File::Spec as portable
    file addressing).

    First time I've used IO::Any for JSON::Util where for the functions to
    encode and decode needs to read/write data.

METHODS
  new($what, $how, $options)
    Open `$what' in `$how' mode.

    `$what' can be:

                    'filename'                => [ 'file' => 'filename' ],
                    'folder/filename'         => [ 'file' => 'folder/filename' ],
                    'file:///folder/filename' => [ 'file' => '/folder/filename' ],
                    [ 'folder', 'filename' ]  => [ 'file' => File::Spec->catfile('folder', 'filename') ],
                    'http://a/b/c'            => [ 'http' => 'http://a/b/c' ],
                    'https://a/b/c'           => [ 'http' => 'https://a/b/c' ],
                    '{"123":[1,2,3]}'         => [ 'string' => '{"123":[1,2,3]}' ],
                    '[1,2,3]'                 => [ 'string' => '[1,2,3]' ],
                    '<xml></xml>'             => [ 'string' => '<xml></xml>' ],
                    "a\nb\nc\n"               => [ 'string' => "a\nb\nc\n" ],
                    *DATA                     => [ 'file' => *{DATA}{IO} ],

    Returns filehandle. IO::String for 'string', IO::File for 'file'. 'http'
    not implemented yet.

    Here are available `%$options' options:

        atomic    true/false if the file operations should be done using L<IO::AtomicFile> or L<IO::File>
        LOCK_SH   lock file for shared access
        LOCK_EX   lock file for exclusive
        LOCK_NB   lock file non blocking (will throw an excpetion if file is
                      already locked, instead of blocking the process)

  _guess_what
    Returns ($type, $what). $type can be:

        file
        string
        http
        iostring
        iofile

    `$what' is normalized path that can be used for IO::*.

  read($what)
    Same as `IO::Any->new($what, '<');' or `IO::Any->new($what);'.

  write($what)
    Same as `IO::Any->new($what, '>');'

  slurp($what)
    Returns content of `$what'.

    If AnyEvent is loaded then uses event loop to read the content.

  spew($what, $data, $opt)
    Writes `$data' to `$what'.

    If AnyEvent is loaded then uses event loop to write the content.
