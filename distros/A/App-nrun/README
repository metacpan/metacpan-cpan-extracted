nrun
====

nrun will run a single command or script on a multiple of target servers
synchronously.  ncopy will copy a file or directory to multiple target servers.

the underlying remote access mechanism is exchangeable. as of now, ssh, nsh, rsh
and local execution modes are implemented.

the return code and all command output will be logged.

configuration
=============

special configuration options for the different modes and additional all
commandline options can be given in a configuration file. the following three
places will be searched for configuration files (values in the last
configuration file will overwrite values in the first configuration file).
indentation does matter (YAML syntax).

- $FindBin::Bin/../etc/nrunrc
- /etc/nrunrc
- $HOME/.nrunrc

logging
=======

on each execution run, the command output and exit code will be saved inside the
logging directory. the default logging directory is $HOME/.nrun. Logging is realized by
so called filters (see FILTERS).

- $LOGDIR/result.log - will contain the exit codes
- $LOGDIR/output.log - will contain the complete command output for all hosts
- $LOGDIR/raw.log - will contain the raw worker output for all hosts

mode ssh
========

use ssh as the underlying remote access mechanism.

the following configuration options must be set in the configuration file:

'ssh_exec'   - commandline for remote execution (COMMAND, ARGUMENTS, HOSTNAME will be replaced)
'ssh_copy'   - commandline for remote copying (SOURCE, TARGET, HOSTNAME will be replaced)
'ssh_rcopy'  - commandline for reverse remote copying (SOURCE, TARGET, HOSTNAME will be replaced)
'ssh_delete' - commandline for remote deletion (FILE, HOSTNAME will be replaced)

for passwordless login ssh-agent can be used:

# ssh-keygen
# scp .ssh/id_rsa.pub $USER@$HOST:.ssh/authorized_keys

# eval `ssh-agent` 
# ssh-add

to prevent any ssh interaction the following ssh command paramters are
suggested:

-o User=root
-o PreferredAuthentications=hostbased,publickey
-o StrictHostKeyChecking=no
-o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null
-o LogLevel=FATAL

mode rsh
========

use rsh as the underlying remote access mechanism.

the following configuration options must be set in the configuration file:

'rsh_exec'   - commandline for remote execution (COMMAND, ARGUMENTS, HOSTNAME will be replaced)
'rsh_copy'   - commandline for remote copying (SOURCE, TARGET, HOSTNAME will be replaced)
'rsh_rcopy'  - commandline for reverse remote copying (SOURCE, TARGET, HOSTNAME will be replaced)
'rsh_delete' - commandline for remote deletion (FILE, HOSTNAME will be replaced)

mode local
==========

execute the script locally for each host and set the environment variable
TARGET_HOST on each execution.

'local_exec' - commandline for local execution (COMMAND, ARGUMENTS, HOSTNAME will be replaced)

mode nsh
========

use nsh as the underlying remote access mechanism.

the following configuration options must be set in the configuration file:

'nsh_exec'   - commandline for remote execution (COMMAND, ARGUMENTS, HOSTNAME will be replaced)
'nsh_copy'   - commandline for remote copying (SOURCE, TARGET, HOSTNAME will be replaced)
'nsh_rcopy'  - commandline for reverse remote copying (SOURCE, TARGET, HOSTNAME will be replaced)
'nsh_delete' - commandline for remote deletion (FILE, HOSTNAME will be replaced)
'nsh_check'  - commandline for the agentinfo check command (HOSTNAME will be replaced)

mode generic
============

this is a special generic mode the can be used for arbitrary remote execution
mechanism. it takes only two configuration options, one to specify a command
for remote exection and one to specify a command for remote copying.

'generic_exec'   - commandline for remote execution (COMMAND, ARGUMENTS, HOSTNAME will be replaced)
'generic_copy'   - commandline for remote copying (SOURCE, TARGET, HOSTNAME will be replaced)
'generic_rcopy'  - commandline for reverse remote copying (SOURCE, TARGET, HOSTNAME will be replaced)
'generic_delete' - commandline for remote deletion (FILE, HOSTNAME will be replaced)

an example that resembles the mode ssh would look the following way:

--<snip>--
generic_copy: >
    /usr/bin/scp
    -o User=root
    -o PreferredAuthentications=hostbased,publickey 
    -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no 
    -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null
    -o LogLevel=FATAL 
    SOURCE HOSTNAME:TARGET 

generic_rcopy: >
    /usr/bin/scp
    -o User=root
    -o PreferredAuthentications=hostbased,publickey 
    -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no 
    -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null
    -o LogLevel=FATAL 
    HOSTNAME:SOURCE TARGET 

generic_exec: >
    /usr/bin/ssh
    -o User=root
    -o PreferredAuthentications=hostbased,publickey
    -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no
    -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null
    -o LogLevel=FATAL
    HOSTNAME COMMAND ARGUMENTS

generic_delete: >
    /usr/bin/ssh
    -o User=root
    -o PreferredAuthentications=hostbased,publickey
    -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no
    -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null
    -o LogLevel=FATAL
    HOSTNAME rm -f "FILE"

filters
=======

a filter reads the raw output generated by the worker processes and prints this
output in a specific format.

filter raw
==========

this filter will just dump the output as it is provided by the worker process. no
formatting will be done.

format:

        HOSTNAME;[stdout|stderr];TSTAMP;PID;PID(CHILD);[debug|error|exit|output|end];"OUTPUT"

filter async
============

this filter dumps the worker process output unsynchronized in the following format. unsynchronised
means, that output lines from the different worker processes are printed at the same time they are
generated.

format:

        HOSTNAME: OUTPUT

filter sync
============

this filter dumps the worker process output synchronised in the following format. synchronized
means, that the complete output for a single hosts will be dumped at once when the worker proces
has finished execution.

format:

        HOSTNAME: OUTPUT

filter result
=============

this filter will only print the exit codes for the worker processes.

format:

        HOSTNAME: exit code CODE


LOGGERS
=======

a logger reads the raw output generated by the worker processes and logs this
output in a specific format.

logger output
=============

this logger creates a logfile in the logging directory called output.log which
contains the same data that the filter sync produces.

logger result
=============

this logger creates a logfile in the logging directory called result.log which
contains the same data that the filter result produces.

logger raw
==========

this logger creates a logfile in the logging directory called raw.log which contains the same
data that the filter raw produces.

checks
======

a check does a specific check for each hostname. if the check fails, the hostname
that failed will be removed from the target list and an error message will be
printed. multiple checks may be given at the command line.

check ping
==========

checks that the host is pingable.

check ns
========

checks that the hostname is resolvable to an ip address.

check rscd
==========

checks that the rscd agent is alive.

targets
=======

a target name may be either a filename containing the target hosts, one per line,
an alias definition in the configuration file or simply a hostname.

if there is a conflict, for example an alias named identically as an existing
file, the alias will always overrule the filename and the filename will always
overrule the hostname.

an alias can be defined in the configuration file the following way. an alias
definition may contain additional alias names, filenames or simply hostnames.
indentation does matter.

    # alias definitions
    alias:
        production:
            - host1
            - host2
        development:
            - host3
            - host4
        all:
            - production
            - development

transferring the public key
===========================

the helper script misc/put_pubkey can be used to transfer the ssh public key
to the target hosts without supplying a password for each login. it is meant
to be executed by the nrun script in mode local.

$ nrun -t HOSTS.LST --mode local --timeout 120 -- ./put_pubkey KEY USER PWD

a note on the git repository
============================

$ git clone https://github.com/tbenk/nrun
$ ln -s ../../.git_hooks/commit-msg .git/hooks

to enable keyword substitution:
$ git config --local filter.keywords.clean ".git_filters/keywords -m clean -f %f"
$ git config --local filter.keywords.smudge ".git_filters/keywords -m smudge -f %f"

to disable keyword substitution:
$ git config --local filter.keywords.smudge "cat"

after git keyword substitution is enabled, the following command will replace
all keywords in the source files:

$ git checkout HEAD .

for keyword substitution to work at least git version v1.7.3.4-599-ga2b665d is
necessary.
