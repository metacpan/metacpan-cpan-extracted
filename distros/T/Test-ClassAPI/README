NAME
    Test::ClassAPI - Provides basic first-pass API testing for large class
    trees

DESCRIPTION
    For many APIs with large numbers of classes, it can be very useful to be
    able to do a quick once-over to make sure that classes, methods, and
    inheritance is correct, before doing more comprehensive testing. This
    module aims to provide such a capability.

  Using Test::ClassAPI
    Test::ClassAPI is used with a fairly standard looking test script, with
    the API description contained in a __DATA__ section at the end of the
    script.

      #!/usr/bin/perl
      
  # Test the API for Foo::Bar
      use strict;
      use Test::More 'tests' => 123; # Optional
      use Test::ClassAPI;
      
  # Load the API to test
      use Foo::Bar;
      
  # Execute the tests
      Test::ClassAPI->execute;
      
  __DATA__
      
  Foo::Bar::Thing=interface
      Foo::Bar::Object=abstract
      Foo::Bar::Planet=class
      
  [Foo::Bar::Thing]
      foo=method
      
  [Foo::Bar::Object]
      bar=method
      whatsit=method
      
  [Foo::Bar::Planet]
      Foo::Bar::Object=isa
      Foo::Bar::Thing=isa
      blow_up=method
      freeze=method
      thaw=method

    Looking at the test script, the code itself is fairly simple. We first
    load Test::More and Test::ClassAPI. The loading and specification of a
    test plan is optional, Test::ClassAPI will provide a plan automatically
    if needed.

    This is followed by a compulsory __DATA__ section, containing the API
    description. This description is in provided in the general form of a
    Windows style .ini file and is structured as follows.

  Class Manifest
    At the beginning of the file, in the root section of the config file, is
    a list of entries where the key represents a class name, and the value
    is one of either 'class', 'abstract', or 'interface'.

    The 'class' entry indicates a fully fledged class. That is, the class is
    tested to ensure it has been loaded, and the existance of every method
    listed in the section ( and its superclasses ) is tested for.

    The 'abstract' entry indicates an abstract class, one which is part of
    our class tree, and needs to exist, but is never instantiated directly,
    and thus does not have to itself implement all of the methods listed for
    it. Generally, many individual 'class' entries will inherit from an
    'abstract', and thus a method listed in the abstract's section will be
    tested for in all the subclasses of it.

    The 'interface' entry indicates an external interface that is not part
    of our class tree, but is inherited from by one or more of our classes,
    and thus the methods listed in the interface's section are tested for in
    all the classes that inherit from it. For example, if a class inherits
    from, and implements, the File::Handle interface, a
    "File::Handle=interface" entry could be added, with the "[File::Handle]"
    section listing all the methods in File::Handle that our class tree
    actually cares about. No tests, for class or method existance, are done
    on the interface itself.

  Class Sections
    Every class listed in the class manifest MUST have an individual
    section, indicated by "[Class::Name]" and containing a set of entries
    where the key is the name of something to test, and the value is the
    type of test for it.

    The 'isa' test checks inheritance, to make sure that the class the
    section is for is (by some path) a sub-class of something else. This
    does not have to be an immediate sub-class. Any class refered to
    (recursively) in a 'isa' test will have its 'method' test entries
    applied to the class as well.

    The 'method' test is a simple method existance test, using
    "UNIVERSAL::can" to make sure that the method exists in the class.

METHODS
  execute
    The "Test::ClassAPI" has a single method, "execute" which is used to
    start the testing process. It accepts a single option argument,
    'complete', which indicates to the testing process that the API listed
    should be considered a complete list of the entire API. This enables an
    additional test for each class to ensure that every public method in the
    class is detailed in the API description, and that nothing has been
    "missed".
