  - Fix the auto-generation of META.yml/META.json.
    - There was a NO_META in the Makefile.PL (WTF?), which preserved

  - New version to get over a CPAN/PAUSE's SNAFU.
    - The CPAN clients don't install the right version.

  - Apply patch to Makefile.PL to fix builds on x86-64 Macintosh:
    - https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=75730
    - Thanks to Ian Barton for the report and the patch.
  - Update lib/Math/Cephes.pod with up-to-date information.

0.47    2009-01-06
  - dmake requires creation of dummy libmd file (reported by Sisyphus)

0.46    2009-01-02
  - Intel Mac support (dsteinbrunner):
      http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=25842
  - support for building on cygwin (patch supplied by Sisyphus)
  - remove LIBS from Makefile.PL, so as not to require creation of dummy
    libmd library, which causes problems on some platforms:
      https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=19716
  - don't run test 36 of t/poly.t, which seems to fail consistently
    on some platforms:
      http://cpantesters.perl.org/show/Math-Cephes.html

    (spotted by Philip Lijnzaad)
  - allow clr() method of Math::Cephes::Matrix to accept
    a value to set all matrix elements equal to
  - incorporate a couple of small changes in igam.c, igami.c,
    polylog.c, and hyperg.c to bring them in synch to cephes 0.28.

    to get the right size of the resulting polynomial

  - move Cephes_wrap.c and arrays.c to top-level directory
    and configure Makefile.PL to build static libmd.
  - generate a mconf.h for darwin (thanks to Thomas Puzia)
  - upgraded Cephes_wrap.c swig wrapper
  - prepended md_ prefix to many functions, to avoid
    collisions with system functions (thanks to Thomas
    Puzia and David Martin for pointing out the problem)

0.36    2002-09-12

  - added functions that require arrays into and out from
    C (simpson's rule, polynomial and matrix routines).
  - added Math::Cephes::Polynomial and Math::Cephes::Matrix
  - added Solaris mconf.h that mostly works (thanks to
    Jost Krieger).

  - added Math::Cephes::Fraction and Math::Cephes::Complex
    for a more "perlish" interface
