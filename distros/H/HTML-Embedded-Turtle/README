NAME
    HTML::Embedded::Turtle - embedding RDF in HTML the crazy way

SYNOPSIS
     use HTML::Embedded::Turtle;
 
     my $het = HTML::Embedded::Turtle->new($html, $base_uri);
     foreach my $graph ($het->endorsements)
     {
       my $model = $het->graph($graph);
   
       # $model is an RDF::Trine::Model. Do something with it.
     }

DESCRIPTION
    RDF can be embedded in (X)HTML using simple <script> tags. This is
    described at <http://esw.w3.org/N3inHTML>. This gives you a file format
    that can contain multiple (optionally named) graphs. The document as a
    whole can "endorse" a graph by including:

     <link rel="meta" href="#foo" />

    Where "#foo" is a fragment identifier pointing to a graph.

     <script type="text/turtle" id="foo"> ... </script>

    The rel="meta" stuff is parsed using an RDFa parser, so equivalent RDFa
    works too.

    This module parses HTML files containing graphs like these, and allows
    you to access them each individually; as a union of all graphs on the
    page; or as a union of just the endorsed graphs.

    Despite the module name, this module supports a variety of <script
    type>s: text/turtle, application/turtle, application/x-turtle text/plain
    (N-Triples), text/n3 (Notation 3), application/x-rdf+json (RDF/JSON),
    application/json (RDF/JSON), and application/rdf+xml (RDF/XML).

    The deprecated attribute "language" is also supported:

     <script language="Turtle" id="foo"> ... </script>

    Languages supported are (case insensitive): "Turtle", "NTriples",
    "RDFJSON", "RDFXML" and "Notation3".

  Constructor
    "HTML::Embedded::Turtle->new($markup, $base_uri, \%opts)"
        Create a new object. $markup is the HTML or XHTML markup to parse;
        $base_uri is the base URI to use for relative references.

        Options include:

        *   markup

            Choose which parser to use: 'html' or 'xml'. The former chooses
            HTML::HTML5::Parser, which can handle tag soup; the latter
            chooses XML::LibXML, which cannot. Defaults to 'html'.

        *   rdfa_options

            A set of options to be parsed to RDF::RDFa::Parser when looking
            for endorsements. See RDF::RDFa::Parser::Config. The default is
            probably sensible.

  Public Methods
    "union_graph"
        A union graph of all graphs found in the document, as an
        RDF::Trine::Model. Note that the returned model contains quads.

    "endorsed_union_graph"
        A union graph of only the endorsed graphs, as an RDF::Trine::Model.
        Note that the returned model contains quads.

    "graph($name)"
        A single graph from the page.

    "graphs"
    "all_graphs"
        A hashref where the keys are graph names and the values are
        RDF::Trine::Models. Some graph names will be URIs, and others may be
        blank nodes (e.g. "_:foobar").

        "graphs" and "all_graphs" are aliases for each other.

    "endorsed_graphs"
        Like "all_graphs", but only returns endorsed graphs. Note that all
        endorsed graphs will have graph names that are URIs.

    "endorsements"
        Returns a list of URIs which are the names of endorsed graphs. Note
        that the presence of a URI $x in this list does not imply that
        "$het->graph($x)" will be defined.

    "dom"
        Returns the page DOM.

    "uri"
        Returns the page URI.
