0.13    1 June 2012
        Fixed problem with "Installation:" in text files, that would keep

0.12    31 May 2012
        Added support for "maint_blead" parameter, so that we can automatically

        and a "blead" version of the code.

        Fixed error in tests for versions of perl / ExtUtils::MakeMaker that
        would not leave test droppings (aka MYMETA.* files).

        Makefile.

0.06    8 february 2004
