Revision history for Tapper-MCP

5.0.8     2019-11-04
        - adapt to reworked Minion signal handling

5.0.7     2018-09-19
        - less aggressive name simplification of uploaded files
        - support for test type 'minion' which enqueues the testrun
          into a Mojo Minion job queue. From there the corresponding
          PRC minion worker can dequeue it. Requires new configuration
          for the Minion database.

5.0.6     2016-11-11
        - Cancel 'local' testruns kills the whole process tree behind it

5.0.5     2016-11-11
        - for 'local' replace hardcoded script with config entry

5.0.4     2016-08-09
        - scheduler fixes

5.0.3     2016-03-11
        - logfile wording and job finishing

5.0.2     2016-03-03
        - intermediate release with misc experimental fixes

5.0.1     2016-02-16
        - better version dependent experimental warnings

5.0.0     2016-02-15
        - internal refactoring
        - use MooseX::Daemonize for daemon
        - plugin system for organizing MCP functionality
        - now as plugins: console handling, reset handling
        - host pool handling: many "anonymous" hosts that have a
          common name where only the count matters but not the
          particular single name. Think of cloud instances.
        - merged TestrunDB/ReportsDB
        - polishing edge cases around:
          * MCP chil exit handling
          * state handling when installation is skipped
          * output directory cleanup
          * interdependent scenarios
          * explicit db disconnects in MCP children

4.1.2     2012-11-23
        - new precondition hint 'local' to run a PRC locally
          around any program which is then your hook to any testing
          (kind of a lightweight machine automation)

4.1.1     2012-11-20
        - dzil pluginbundle TAPPER

4.1.0     2012-10-19

        - [FEAT] Scheduler with non-DBIC objects
        - [FEAT] scheduler in separate process
        - [TEST] for memory growth
        - make package immutable

        * PostgreSQL support
        - [FIX] slow first() usage
        - rename USER into OWNER

        * Cobbler integration (first part)
        - [FEAT] new precondition_type "cobbler"

        * Features
        - [FEAT] host blacklists per queue ("denied host")
        - [FEAT] poor mans nesting for SimNow
        - [FEAT] new precondition "testrun_stop"

        * Misc
        - [FIX] condition to grep for forbidden hosts

4.0.5     2012-06-26
        - rework tmp/log/pid file handling in daemon and reset plugin

        - help with Crypt::DH deps via AAAA::Crypt::DH

4.0.3     2012-06-11
        - hide test modules from PAUSE

4.0.2     2012-06-05
        - timeout handling bit more lax to adapt PRC timing changes
        - log files during test

4.0.1     2012-05-16
        - *lots* of enhancements in whole automation layer
        - MCP is now a stop/resume-able state engine,
          based on event queues,
          making the whole automation persistent,
          inclusive still correctly recalculating timeouts
        - introduce SSH-connect to test without complete machine setup
        - introduce 'notification framework' to conditionally
          trigger notifications on incoming results
        - SIGUSR1 based live debugging, testrun-id part of process name
        - introduced keep-alive detection
        - reworked API for reset plugins
        - OSRC-RESET plugin with watchdog-style success checking
        - configurable and host-dependent grub-config
        - improved integration with kickstart/autoyast/debinst installers
        - allow lazy precondition producers also in "virt" preconditions
        - big Dist::Zilla roundhouse kick
