NAME
    Crypt::OpenSSL::Blowfish::CFB64 - Blowfish CFB64 Algorithm using OpenSSL

SYNOPSIS
      use Crypt::OpenSSL::Blowfish::CFB64;
  
      my $crypt = Crypt::OpenSSL::Blowfish::CFB64->new($key);
      # or
      my $crypt = Crypt::OpenSSL::Blowfish::CFB64->new($key, $ivec = pack( C8 => 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 ));
  
      my $binary_data = $crypt->encrypt("source");
      my $hex_data = $crypt->encrypt_hex("source");

      my $source = $crypt->decrypt($binary_data);
      my $source = $crypt->decrypt_hex($hex_data);

DESCRIPTION
    Crypt::OpenSSL::Blowfish::CFB64 implements the Blowfish cipher algorithm
    in CFB mode, using function "BF_cfb64_encrypt" contained in the OpenSSL
    crypto library.
