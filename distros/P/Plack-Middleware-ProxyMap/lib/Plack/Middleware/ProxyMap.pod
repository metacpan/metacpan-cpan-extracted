=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $map = YAML::Load(<<'...');
    - prefix: /yahoo/
      remote: http://au.search.yahoo.com/search?p=
      preserve_host_header: 1
      env:
        HTTP_COOKIE: some cookie text
    - prefix: /google/

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This middleware allows you to easily map one or more URL prefixes to
remote URLs.

It makes use of L<Plack::App::Proxy> and supports its options. It also makes
it easy to specify custom overrides to any of the PSGI environment entries.
These are often necessary to proxy successfully.

=head1 PARAMETERS

The input to this module is an array ref of hash refs that contain the
following keys:

=over

=item prefix (required)

The string that matches the beginning of the URL. It it matches, it is
removed and the rest of the URL is tacked onto the end of the C<remote> URL.
(See below).

=item remote (required)

This is the remote URL to proxy to. The remainder of the incoming URL is
tacked onto this after the C<prefix> is removed. (See above).

=item preserve_host_header (optional)

Accepted values are 0 (default) or 1. Passed through to L<Plack::App::Proxy>.
See that module for more info.

If a proxy is not working as expected, try playing with this option.

=item env (optional)

This is a hash ref that will be merged into the current plack C<env> hash when
the proxy is used.

By default Proxymap will clear PATH_INFO, QUERY_STRING and HTTP_COOKIE,
which is usually what you want. To not clear anything, set this option to a
empty hash ref.

Can be useful for cookie injection, should you need that.

=item backend (optional)

Use this to specify an alternative backend for L<Plack::App::Proxy>. See that
module for more info.

=item debug (optional)

Set this to 1 to warn the remote url when performing a proxy.

=back

=head1 USAGE NOTE

This module can make it trivial to do ajax calls from JavaScript to load
external web pages. Since the browser thinks it is now your local web page,
there is no cross site prevention. When you get the content back, you can load
it into a DOM element and use things like jQuery to easily find data, that you
can subsequently display. You can also use REST APIs that offer JSON but not
JSONP, directly from JavaScript.

=head1 CREDIT

This is just a simple way to use L<Plack::App::Proxy>. Thanks to Lee Aylward
for that work.

Thanks to Strategic Data for supporting the writing and release of this
module.
