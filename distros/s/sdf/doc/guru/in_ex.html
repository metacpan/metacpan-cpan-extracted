<H1>1. Extending SDF</H1>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Overview">1.1. Overview</A></H2>
<H3><A NAME="Logical Documents">1.1.1. Logical Documents</A></H3>
<P>A central part of SDF's philosophy is that documents should be specified in a logical manner. In order to make this possible, SDF has been designed to be easy to extend.</P>
<H3><A NAME="Documenting Extensions">1.1.2. Documenting Extensions</A></H3>
<P>If you do extend SDF and other people need to use your extensions, please try to document things. Within the SDF distribution, the SDF document catalog (doc/catalog.html) provides a link for local documentation (doc/local/) which you may wish to use.</P>
<H3><A NAME="Packaging Extensions">1.1.3. Packaging Extensions</A></H3>
<P>If your extensions would be useful to a wider audience, please consider packaging them into an SDF library or module, documenting the features and notifying people on the SDF mailing lists.</P>
<H3><A NAME="What Can I Create">1.1.4. What Can I Create?</A></H3>
<P>Almost every part of SDF is extensible. As a rule, the most commonly created extensions are new macros and new filters. However, creating new paragraph, phrase and table styles is also quite simple.</P>
<P>Details on how to create these things and other SDF entities are given below.</P>
