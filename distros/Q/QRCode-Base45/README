NAME
    QRCode::Base45 - Base45 encoding used in QR codes

SYNOPSIS
        use QRCode::Base45;

        my $text_for_qrcode = encode_base45($binary_or_utf8_data);
        my $binary_data = decode_base45($text_from_qrcode);

DESCRIPTION
    This module handles encoding/decoding of Base45 data, as described in
    draft-faltstrom-base45-06
    <http://www.watersprings.org/pub/id/draft-faltstrom-base45-06.html>.
    Base45 is used especially in QR codes, for example in European
    vaccination certificates.

  encode_base45
    Takes an arbitrary string as argument, and returns the Base45
    representation of it. Character strings (as opposed to byte strings) are
    encoded to bytes as UTF-8.

    For zero-length input strings (undef or '') an empty string ('') is
    returned.

  decode_base45
    Takes a textual Base45 representation of data, and tries to decode it.
    Returned value is a byte string (as this function cannot possibly know
    whether the content should be interpreted as bytes or UTF-8). The caller
    has to decode the returned byte string to characters afterwards, if
    needed.

    For zero-length input strings (undef or '') an empty string ('') is
    returned.

    For invalid inputs, such as strings of length 3n+1 or characters outside
    of the Base45 alphabet, this function croak()s.

BUGS
    Please report any bugs or feature requests to "bug-qrcode-base45 at
    rt.cpan.org", or through the web interface at
    <https://rt.cpan.org/NoAuth/ReportBug.html?Queue=QRCode-Base45>. I will
    be notified, and then you'll automatically be notified of progress on
    your bug as I make changes.

    The Base45 encoding is relatively new. After it is standardized and
    maybe used elsewhere apart from QR codes, this module should probably be
    moved to some other namespace, such as IETF:: or RFCxyzq::.
