NAME
    Cache::Meh - A cache of indifferent quality

VERSION
    version 0.04

SYNOPSIS
        use 5.008;
        use Cache::Meh;
        use Digest::SHA qw(sha1);

        my $cache = Cache::Meh->new(
            filename => 'blort',
            validity => 10, # seconds
            lookup => sub { 
                my $key = shift;
                return sha1($key);
            },
        );

        my $value = $cache->get('some_key');

        if ( sha1('some_key') eq $value ) {
            print "equal\n";
        }
        else {
            print "not equal\n";
        }

OVERVIEW
    This module is intended to implement a very simple memory cache where
    the internal cache state is serialized to disk by Storable so that the
    cached data persists beyond a single execution environment which makes
    it suitable for things like cron tasks or CGI handlers and the like.

    You may optionally disable disk access by setting the "only_memory"
    attribute.

    Cache state is stored to disk when a key is set in the cache; keys are
    only purged from the cache when they expire and there is no "lookup"
    function available. These are arguably bad design decisions which may
    encourage you to seek your caching pleasure elsewhere. On the other
    hand, pull requests are welcome.

    Since this module is intended to be run under Perl 5.8 (but preferably
    much much more recent Perls) it sadly eschews fancy object systems like
    Moo. It doesn't require any dependencies beyond core modules. I maybe
    would have called it Cache::Tiny, but then people might use it.

    Besides, this is a cache of indifferent quality. You probably ought to
    be using something awesome like CHI or Cache::Cache or Cache.

ATTRIBUTES
  filename
    This is the filename for your Storable file. Required unless you specify
    "only_memory".

    The file is written to the "temporary" path as provided by File::Spec
    "tmpdir". On Unix systems, you may influence this directory by setting
    the "TMPDIR" environment variable.

  only_memory
    If this attribute is set, then DO NOT access the disk for reads or
    writes. Only store cache values in memory. This option is mutually
    exclusive from the "filename" attribute above.

  validity
    Pass an argument to set it; no argument to get its current value.

    How long keys should be considered valid in seconds. Arguments must be
    positive integers.

    Each key has an insert time; when the insert time + validity is greater
    than the current time, the cache refreshes the cached value by executing
    the lookup function or evicting the key from the cache if no lookup
    function is provided.

    This value defaults to 300 seconds (5 minutes) if not provided.

  lookup
    Pass an argument to set it; no argument to get its current value.

    A coderef which is executed when a key is no longer valid or not found
    in the cache. The coderef is given the cache key as a parameter.

    Optional; no default.

METHODS
  new
    A constructor. You must provide the filename unless "only_memory" is
    set. You may optionally provide a validity time and lookup function. The
    cache state is loaded (if available) as part of object construction.

  get
    Takes a key which can be any valid Perl hash key term. Returns the
    cached value or undef if no lookup function is defined.

  set
    Takes a key and a value which is unconditionally inserted into the
    cache. Returns the cache object.

    The cache state is serialized during set operations unless "only_memory"
    is set.
