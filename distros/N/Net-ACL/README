Net::ACL version 0.06
=====================

The Net::ACL module allows a Perl program to do complex filtering and
manipulation of data in the same way as routers does with access-lists
and route-maps.

The access and control lists are general and can handle any data that
perl can handle. The bundled matching and modification modules however
have been focused on data like IP addresses and data found in the BGP
protocol. Later other router data types may be added.

However adding simple matching rules or modification rules for other
complex data types are simple.

Any comments and feedback are more then welcome!
