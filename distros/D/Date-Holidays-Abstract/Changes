Changes file for Date-Holidays-Abstract

0.07 2014.09.01, maintenance release, update not necessary

- Updated requirement to Class::Virtually::Abstract instead of Class::Virtual,
  this was the requirment used but not specified. The first is a compile time
  check variant of the first

- Updated Dist::Zilla configuration with more plugins to save more time

- Bumped up license to Artistic 2.0 (was done in 0.06, forgot to mention)


0.06 2014.08.20, maintenance release, update not necessary

- Added changes.t TEST::CPAN::Changes test

- Updated t/kwalitee.t to more contemporary version


0.05 2007.03.13, maintenance release, update not necessary

- Added missing t/perlcriticrc

- Updated to more contemporary versions of:
    t/pod-coverage.t
    t/pod.t

  These should be there for the quality, but will not be run as a part of the
  normal test run, unless the TEST_POD environment variable is set.

  This seem to be the defacto way of doing things.
