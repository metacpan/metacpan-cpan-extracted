NAME

    HTML::Template::Plugin::Dot::Helpers - Add useful objects to your
    templates

SYNOPSIS

      use HTML::Template::Plugin::Dot::Helpers;

    Then in your template, you can do:

      <tmpl_var Number.format_currency(orderitem.price)>
      

DESCRIPTION

    This helper class adds some useful objects to your Dot-enabled
    templates (see HTML::Template::Plugin::Dot).

 Added objects

    Number

      An extended Number::Format object. See Number::Format for
      documentation. Note that only the object oriented methods are
      supported here.

      I've added several generic numerical methods. Most (well, all in this
      release) are boolean methods, useful in <tmpl_if>s. They are:

      equals - test whether two numbers are equal (==)

      le, lt, ge, gt - test how two numbers compare

	(implemented with <=, <, >=, > respectively)

      The following is not yet implemented.

    String

      Adds generic string testing functions similar to the above:

      equals - test whether two strings are equal (eq)

      le, lt, ge, gt - test how two strings compare lexically
