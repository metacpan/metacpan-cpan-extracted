=head1 NAME

KinoSearch::Plan::FieldType - Define a field's behavior.

=head1 DEPRECATED

The KinoSearch code base has been assimilated by the Apache L<Lucy> project.
The "KinoSearch" namespace has been deprecated, but development continues
under our new name at our new home: L<http://lucy.apache.org/>

=head1 SYNOPSIS


    my @sortable;
    for my $field ( @{ $schema->all_fields } ) {
        my $type = $schema->fetch_type($field);
        next unless $type->sortable;
        push @sortable, $field;
    }




=head1 DESCRIPTION

FieldType is an abstract class defining a set of traits and behaviors which
may be associated with one or more field names. 

Properties which are common to all field types include C<< boost >>,
C<< indexed >>, C<< stored >>, C<< sortable >>,
C<< binary >>, and C<< similarity >>.

The C<< boost >> property is a floating point scoring multiplier
which defaults to 1.0.  Values greater than 1.0 cause the field to
contribute more to a document's score, lower values, less.

The C<< indexed >> property indicates whether the field should be
indexed (so that it can be searched). 

The C<< stored >> property indicates whether to store the raw field
value, so that it can be retrieved when a document turns up in a search.

The C<< sortable >> property indicates whether search results should
be sortable based on the contents of the field.

The C<< binary >> property indicates whether the field contains
binary or text data.  Unlike most other properties, C<< binary >> is
not settable.

The C<< similarity >> property is a
L<Similarity|KinoSearch::Index::Similarity> object which defines matching
and scoring behavior for the field.  It is required if the field is
C<< indexed >>.
