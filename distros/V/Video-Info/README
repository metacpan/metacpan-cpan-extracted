Video::Info version 0.99
=======-================

Suite of modules to probe video files for various attributes.

Previous versions of Video::Info depended on external modules, such as
RIFF::Info and ASF::Info.  This is no longer the case, you don't need to
install them.  All the functionality is now included with the Video::Info
distribution.

To contribute, use Video::Info::FOO as a template to write
a module, and email it to the Allen Day <allenday@ucla.edu>.
Also see t/FOO.t as an example test script to verify the
sanity of your code.
