PDF/Reuse version 0.40
======================

This module gives you a possibility to reuse PDF-files. You can use pages,
images, fonts and Acrobat JavaScript from old PDF-files (if they
were not encrypted), and rearrange the components, and add new graphics,
texts etc.

There is also support for graphics. In the tutorial there is a description of
how to transform simple PDF-pages to graphic Perl objects with the help of
programs based on this module.

The module is fairly fast, so it should be possible to used it for mass
production.

Usage e.g. for a long list:

   use PDF::Reuse;
   use strict;

   # Getting customer data in some way ...

   my @custData = ( { firstName => 'Anders',
                      lastName  => 'Wallberg' },
                    { firstName => 'Nils',
                      lastName  => 'Versen' },
                    { firstName => 'Niclas',
                      lastName  => 'Lindberg' },

                    # and 10000 more records

                    { firstName => 'Sten',
                      lastName  => 'Wernlund' } );

   prFile('myFile.pdf');

   for my $customer (@custData)
   {    prForm('letter.pdf');
        prText(50, 750, "Dear $customer->{'firstName'}");
        # ...
        prPage();
   }
   prEnd();
