 [00 Major]
 - Changes that will affect hand operated downstreams.

 [01 Version Scheme]
 - Migrated to x.yyyzzz from x.y.z
 - This is the primary reason for the 1.x on the box.
 - https://questhub.io/realm/perl/quest/5388d3a9bbd0be2224000129

 [02 Tooling]
 - Moved to ExtUtils::MakeMaker
 - "Latest" deps for toolchain parts are now only "recommended"
 - https://questhub.io/realm/perl/quest/5388cc12bbd0be5b2500011f

 [03 Cleanup functions nuked from orbit]
 - The persist function is now handled on a tempdir basis by directly using File::Temp tricks.
 - This means that any tempdir that is to be freed will be freed as soon as it is no longer referenced
 - so ->_clear_dir will wipe it
 - and program termination should wipe it.
 - so cleanse and DESTROY are no longer needed
