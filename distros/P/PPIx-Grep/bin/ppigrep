=head1 NAME

ppigrep - Search L<PPI> documents (not Perl code).


=head1 VERSION

This document describes ppigrep version 0.0.6.


=head1 USAGE

    ppigrep [--format format] PPI-class file [...]

    ppigrep { -h | --help | -V | --version }


=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<ppigrep> is meant as a means of more intelligently searching L<PPI>
documents than via L<ack> or C<grep>.  You might know PPI documents
better as Perl code, but there are valid PPI documents that are not
valid Perl.  See the PPI documentation for the details on the
differences.

C<ppigrep> does not search or emit lines from your files.  It searches
and emits the contents of L<PPI::Element>s, which may consist of
partial or multiple lines.  Thus, given a file F<foo.pl> which
contains

    $x = 'a' . 'b';

C<ppigrep quote foo.pl> will emit

    foo.pl:1:6:'a'
    foo.pl:1:12:'b'

by default, even though both expressions were found on the same line.


=head1 REQUIRED ARGUMENTS

=over

=item · PPI-class

A comma-delimited list of names of L<PPI::Element> subclasses to
search for, as recognizable by L<PPIx::Shorthand>.

For example, you could specify "package,include" to get all instances
of L<PPI::Statement::Package> and L<PPI::Statement::Include>.


=item · file [...]

A list of files to search.


=back


=head1 OPTIONS

=over

=item · C<--match>

A Perl regular expression that each L<PPI::Element>'s contents must
match.


=item · C<--format format>

A C<printf>-like format for the output for each found L<PPI::Element>.
The default value is C<%f:%l:%c:%s>.

Specifiable fields are:

=over

=item C<%f> – The name of the file.

=item C<%l> – The starting line number of the element.

=item C<%c> – The starting character within the first line of the
element.

=item C<%C> – The starting column within the first line of the
element.  This will differ from C<%c> when there are tab characters.

=item C<%L> – The class of the element, with the 'PPI::' prefix
removed (you can always get that back by prefixing this field with the
5 characters).

=item C<%s> – The source-code/content for the element.

=item C<%S> – The source-code/content for the element, C<chomp>ed.

=item C<%W> – The source-code/content for the element, leading and trailing
whitespace removed and all other whitespace converted to a single space
character.

=back

Z<>

=item · C<--help> or C<-h>

Emit a short description of this command and its options and quit.


=item · C<--version> or C<-V>

Emit the version of this command and quit.


=back


=head1 EXAMPLES

=over

=item Show all C<eval> statements.

    ppigrep --format '%s' --match '^\s*eval' statement Some/Module.pm


=item Find all calls to the date program via back-ticks, e.g. C<`date`>.

    ppigrep --match '\bdate\b' backtick Some/Module.pm


=back


=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

Exits with a value that is equivalent to the one for C<grep>.  If a
match was found, this is 0.  If no match was found, this is 1.  And if
any problems occurred, this is 2.


=over

=item Could not figure out what PPI class to use for "%s".

The PPI-class argument could not be resolved to a subclass of
C<PPI::Element> via L<PPIx::Shorthand>.


=item Could not find any PPI::Element subclasses to use for "%s".

The pattern argument didn't resolve to any L<PPI::Element> subclasses.
Did you specify the empty string?


=item Invalid regex "%s": %s.

The regex specified via C<--match> could not be compiled.


=item "%s" does not exist.

Cannot find the file.


=item "%s" is not readable.

Cannot read the file.


=item "%s" is a directory.

The "file" was actually a directory.


=item Could not parse "%s".

L<PPI> could not interpret the file as a Perl document.


=back


=head1 CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT

None, yet.


=head1 DEPENDENCIES

L<PPIx::Grep>


=head1 INCOMPATIBILITIES

None known.


=head1 BUGS AND LIMITATIONS

=over

=item · This thing is way too limited in functionality.


=back
