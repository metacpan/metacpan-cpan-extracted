DESCRIPTION

    This module implements the ideas from
    https://code.facebook.com/posts/991252547593574 to create the data
    needed for inline previews of images that can be served within the HTML
    page while keeping a low overhead of around 250 bytes per image
    preview. This is achieved by splitting up the preview image into a JPEG
    header which is common to all images and the JPEG image data. With a
    Javascript-enabled browser, these previews will be shown until the
    request for the real image has finished loading the data. This reduces
    the latency and bandwidth needed until the user sees an image.

    It turns the following image

    into 250 bytes of image data representing this image:

    The Javascript on the client side then scales and blurs that preview
    image to create a very blurry placeholder until the real image data
    arrives from the server.

    See below for the Javascript needed to reassemble the image data from
    the split header and scan data.

METHODS

 Image::JpegMinimal->new( %OPTIONS )

      my $compressor = Image::JpegMinimal->new(
          xmax => 42,
          ymax => 42,
          jpegquality => 20,
      );

    Creates a new compressor object. The xmax and ymax values give the
    maximum dimensions for the size of the preview image. It is suggested
    that the preview image is heavily blurred when presenting the preview
    image to the user to hide the JPEG artifacts.

 $compressor->data_preview

      my $data_preview = $compressor->data_preview( $file );

    Reads the JPEG data from a file and returns a base64 encoded string of
    the reduced image data. You stuff this into the data-preview attribute
    of the img tag in your HTML.

 $compressor->headers

      my %headers = $compressor->headers;

    After processing all files, this method returns the headers that are
    common to the images. You need to pass this to your Javascript.

HTML

    Each image that has a pre-preview placeholder will need to store the
    placeholder data in the data-preview attribute. That is all the
    modification you need. You should also set the width and height
    attributes of the image so that no ugly image-popping occurs when the
    real data arrives. The $payload64 is the data that is returned from the
    ->data_preview call.

        <img width="${final_width}px" height="${final_height}px"
           data-preview="$payload64"
           src="$file"
           />

JAVASCRIPT

    You will need to include some Javascript like the following in your
    page, preferrably near the end so the code runs right after the HTML
    has loaded completely but image loading has not yet fired.

    The hash %headers should be set to the base64 encoded fixed headers as
    returned by the ->headers( $file ) call. The image HTML should have
    been constructed as outlined above.

        "use strict";
    
        var header = {
            l : atob("$headers{l}"),
            h : atob("$headers{p}"),
        };
        function reconstruct(data) {
            // Reconstruct a JPEG header from our special data structure
            var raw = atob(data);
            // Keep as "char" so we don't have to bother with Unicode vs. ASCII
            var width  = raw.charAt(0);
            var height = raw.charAt(1);
            var payload = raw.substring(2,raw.length);
            var head;
            if( width < height ) {
                head = header["p"]
            } else {
                head = header["l"]
            };
            var dimension_patch = width+height;
            var patched_header = head.substring(0,head.length-13)
                               + width
                               + head.substring(head.length-12,head.length-11)
                               + height
                               + head.substring(head.length-10,head.length);
            var reconstructed = patched_header+payload;
            var encoded = "data:image/jpeg;base64,"+btoa(reconstructed);
            return encoded;
        }
    
        var image_it = document.evaluate("//img[\@data-preview]",document, null, XPathResult.ANY_TYPE, null);
        var images = [];

        for( var i = 0; i < images.length; i++ ) {
            var el = images[ i ];
            if( !el.complete || el.naturalWidth == 0 || el.naturalHeight == 0) {
            
                var fullsrc = el.src;

                img.height = el.height;
                // Shouldn't we also copy the style and maybe even some events?!
                // img = el.cloneNode(true); // except this doesn't copy the eventListeners etc. Duh.
                (function(img,container,src) {
                    img.onload = function() {
                        // Put the loaded child in the place of the preloaded data
                        parent.replaceChild(img,container);
                    };
                    var timeout = 1000+Math.random()*3000;
                    // Kick off the loading
                    // The timeout is just for demonstration purposes
