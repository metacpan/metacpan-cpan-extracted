		- Changed the way dynamically calculated attributes work, now they
		  are defined in a third parameter to doc_matches(), which allows
		  for greater flexibility, and also calculating attributes from other
		  calculated attributes. See "DYNAMICALLY CALCULATED ATTRIBUTES" under
		  MQUL::Reference.
		- More dynamic functions added, such as $diff, $sum, $product, etc.
