0.21    2016-10-19  Released-By: PERLANCAR

        - [Experimental] Create lib/Bencher/ScenarioR/* module files that
          contain raw benchmark sample results. (Doing this in this Pod::Weaver
          plugin is a bit too late though, because the generated files won't get
          weaved. I plan to move the sample benchmarking into
          Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Bencher::Scenario and pass the result to this
          plugin).
