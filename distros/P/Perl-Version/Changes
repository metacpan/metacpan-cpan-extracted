1.014 2015-11-29T16:03:25Z
	* Bump to release version

1.013   2014-02-12
	* Remove File::Slurp, which has a critical security issue (RT 92974)

1.011   2011-02-21
	* Remove Build.PL which didn't install perl-reversion.

1.010   2010-09-19
	* Install perl-reversion by default.

1.009   2009-03-08
	* Make perl-reversion better at inferring version from structured
	files and not getting confused by unstructured files (like
	README). See #43946.

1.008   2009-03-07
	* Skip perl-reversion tests on Windows. They need fork.
	* Allow negative indexes on component, increment. See #42181.
	* perl-reversion now checks in bin, script subdirectories. See #28119.

1.007   2008-04-07
	Fix for perl-reversion:
	* try to only find top-level keys in META.yml; this means we will stop
	  catching the version from meta-spec and (hopefully) only catch the
	  dist's version.

1.006   2008-04-07
	Major fix for perl-reversion:
	* -bump now properly maintains the number of version components;
	  previously, it was treating every version as though it had at least 3
	  components, so e.g. 1.1 was being wrongly bumped to 1.1.1
	Other fixes for perl-reversion:
	* -bump -stringify will now properly keep the original version format
	  (it was acting as though -normal had been specified)
	* noted that -stringify is the effective default for -bump/-set, so
	  those options more accurately report the new version

1.005   2008-04-03
	Fixes for perl-reversion:
	* Allow any of the version formats as options for displaying or
	  setting/bumping the version.
	* Display current version in the format found rather than as though -normal had been used.
	* Allow more specific -bump-<component> options.
	* Using -current=1.2 no longer matches 1.2.3 in some cases

1.004   2007-11-08
	* Removed '> 999' warning.

1.003   2007-11-08
	* Removed version.pm dependency.

1.002   2007-09-07
	* Improved META.yml handling. So now it, er, works.

1.001   2007-09-07
	* Added META.yml to perl-reversion's list of target files.

1.000   2007-09-03
	* Removed warning about long version numbers not having a mulitple
	of three digits. Perl 5.00504 doesn't have a multiple of three
	digits and it shouldn't be discriminated against.

0.0.8   2007-03-29
	* Documentation fixes
	* Added -dryrun option to perl-reversion [27649]. Thanks to DAXIM
	for the patch.

	* Alpha used to default to three digits, changed to two.

	* Added perl-reversion example / utility

0.0.4   2007-02-24

	* Added machine readable licence.

0.0.2   2007-02-07
