NAME
    Text::WideChar::Util - Routines for text containing wide characters

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.170 of Text::WideChar::Util (from Perl
    distribution Text-WideChar-Util), released on 2019-05-17.

SYNOPSIS
     use Text::WideChar::Util qw(
         mbpad pad mbswidth mbswidth_height mbtrunc trunc mbwrap wrap);

     # get width as well as number of lines
     say mbswidth_height("red\n红色"); # => [4, 2]

     # wrap text to a certain column width
     say mbwrap("....", 40);

     # pad (left, right, center) text to specified column width, handle multilines
     say mbpad("foo", 10);                          # => "foo       "
     say mbpad("红色", 10, "left");                 # => "      红色"
     say mbpad("foo\nbarbaz\n", 10, "center", "."); # => "...foo....\n..barbaz..\n"

     # truncate text to a certain column width
     say mbtrunc("红色",  2); # => "红"
     say mbtrunc("红色",  3); # => "红"
     say mbtrunc("红red", 3); # => "红r"

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides routines for dealing with text containing wide
    characters (wide meaning occupying more than 1 column width in
    terminal).

INTERNAL NOTES
    Should we wrap at hyphens? Probably not. Both Emacs as well as
    Text::Wrap do not.

FUNCTIONS
  mbswidth($text) => INT
    Like Text::CharWidth's mbswidth(), except implemented using
    Unicode::GCString->new($text)->columns.

  mbswidth_height($text) => [INT, INT]
    Like mbswidth(), but also gives height (number of lines). For example,
    "mbswidth_height("foobar\nb\n")" gives [6, 3].

  length_height($text) => [INT, INT]
    This is the non-wide version of mbswidth_height() and can be used if
    your text only contains printable ASCII characters and newlines.

  mbwrap($text, $width, \%opts) => STR
    Wrap $text to $width columns. Replaces multiple whitespaces with a
    single space.

    It uses mbswidth() instead of Perl's length() which works on a
    per-character basis. Has some support for wrapping Kanji/CJK
    (Chinese/Japanese/Korean) text which do not have whitespace between
    words.

    Options:

    *   tab_width => INT (default: 8)

        Set tab width.

        Note that tab will only have effect on the indent. Tab between text
        will be replaced with a single space.

    *   flindent => STR

        First line indent. If unspecified, will be deduced from the first
        line of text.

    *   slindent => STD

        Subsequent line indent. If unspecified, will be deduced from the
        second line of text, or if unavailable, will default to empty string
        ("").

    *   return_stats => BOOL (default: 0)

        If set to true, then instead of returning the wrapped string,
        function will return "[$wrapped, $stats]" where $stats is a hash
        containing some information like "max_word_width", "min_word_width".

    *   keep_trailing_space => BOOL (default: 0)

        If set to true, then trailing space that separates words will be
        kept at the end of wrapped lines. This option is useful if you want
        to rejoin the lines later. Without this option set to true, wrapping
        this line at width=4 (quotes shown):

         "some long   line"

        will result in:

         "some"
         "long"
         "line"

        While if this option is set to true, the result will be:

         "some "
         "long "
         "line"

    Performance: ~450/s on my Core i5 1.7GHz laptop for a 1KB of text.

  wrap($text, $width, \%opts) => STR
    Like mbwrap(), but uses character-based length() instead of column
    width-wise mbswidth(). Provided as an alternative to the venerable
    Text::Wrap's wrap() but with a different behaviour. This module's wrap()
    can reflow newline and its behavior is more akin to Emacs (try reflowing
    a paragraph in Emacs using "M-q").

    Performance: ~2000/s on my Core i5 1.7GHz laptop for a ~1KB of text.
    Text::Wrap::wrap() on the other hand is ~2500/s.

  mbpad($text, $width[, $which[, $padchar[, $truncate]]]) => STR
    Return $text padded with $padchar to $width columns. $which is either
    "r" or "right" for padding on the right (the default if not specified),
    "l" or "left" for padding on the right, or "c" or "center" or "centre"
    for left+right padding to center the text.

    $padchar is whitespace if not specified. It should be string having the
    width of 1 column.

  pad($text, $width[, $which[, $padchar[, $truncate]]]) => STR
    The non-wide version of mbpad(), just like in mbwrap() vs wrap().

  mbtrunc($text, $width) => STR
    Truncate $text to $width columns. It uses mbswidth() instead of Perl's
    length(), so it can handle wide characters.

    Does *not* handle multiple lines.

  trunc($text, $width) => STR
    The non-wide version of mbtrunc(), just like in mbwrap() vs wrap(). This
    is actually not much more than Perl's "substr($text, 0, $width)".

BUGS
    Please report any bugs or feature requests on the bugtracker website
    <https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Dist/Display.html?Name=Text-WideChar-Util>

    When submitting a bug or request, please include a test-file or a patch
    to an existing test-file that illustrates the bug or desired feature.

SEE ALSO
    Unicode::GCString which is consulted for visual width of characters.
    Text::CharWidth is about 2.5x faster but it gives weird results (-1 for
    characters like "\n" and "\t") and my Strawberry Perl installation fails
    to build it.

    Text::ANSI::Util which can also handle text containing wide characters
    as well ANSI escape codes.

    Text::WrapI18N which provides an alternative to wrap()/mbwrap() with
    comparable speed, though wrapping result might differ slightly. And the
    module currently uses Text::CharWidth.

    Text::NonWideChar::Util contains non-wide version of some of the
    abovementioned routines (the non-wide version of the routines will
    eventually be moved here).
