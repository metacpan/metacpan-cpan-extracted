=head1 NAME

Lucy::Plan::FullTextType - Full-text search field type.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $easyanalyzer = Lucy::Analysis::EasyAnalyzer->new(
        language => 'en',
    );
    my $type = Lucy::Plan::FullTextType->new(
        analyzer => $easyanalyzer,
    );
    my $schema = Lucy::Plan::Schema->new;
    $schema->spec_field( name => 'title',   type => $type );
    $schema->spec_field( name => 'content', type => $type );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Lucy::Plan::FullTextType is an implementation of
L<FieldType|Lucy::Plan::FieldType> tuned for “full text search”.

Full text fields are associated with an
L<Analyzer|Lucy::Analysis::Analyzer>, which is used to tokenize and
normalize the text so that it can be searched for individual words.

For an exact-match, single value field type using character data, see
L<StringType|Lucy::Plan::StringType>.

=head1 CONSTRUCTORS

=head2 new

    my $type = Lucy::Plan::FullTextType->new(
        analyzer      => $analyzer,    # required
        boost         => 2.0,          # default: 1.0
        indexed       => 1,            # default: true
        stored        => 1,            # default: true
        sortable      => 1,            # default: false
        highlightable => 1,            # default: false
    );
