== INSTALLATION VIA CPAN =======================================================

You can install the base WebDyne module, and all prerequisites, with:

perl -MCPAN -e 'install WebDyne'

or 

cpanm WebDyne

This assumes you have already setup and initialised CPAN appropriately for your
environment.

Note that WebDyne will not be automatically usable after this - you must modify
your Web server configuration to make it active or install the Plack PSGI
version.  You may do this manually (referring to the documentation available in
the doc directory, or at http://webdyne.org) or via an installer module which
will do the work for you.


== INSTALLATION OF PSGI VERSION =================================================

To use the PSGI version of WebDyne install the Plack module via:

cpanm Plack

You can then start the WebDyne server via the command

webdyne.psgi --test

To validate it is working.  See instruction at https://webdyne.org for
additional usage information


== INSTALLATION OF APACHE VERSION ===============================================

The base WebDyne module comes with an installer module for Apache.  It will be
installed into whichever bin location (usually /usr/local/bin) your CPAN
configuration defaults to.

You can run the installer with the command:

wdapacheinit

It will use reasonable defaults to try and locate and update your Apache
config, Webdyne cache dir.  etc.  If you need to alter the defaults do a

wdapacheinit --help


== INSTALLATION VIA MANUAL BUILD ==============================================

You can download and install the base WebDyne module with the following
commands after it is unpacked:

perl Makefile.PL make make test make install

You will need to download and install all prerequisite modules manually. 
Modules required should be listed when you run the "perl Makefile.PL" command
above.

Similarly to the CPAN install you will either need to adjust your Web server
config manually to serve WebDyne pages, or run/download the appropriate
installer module.
