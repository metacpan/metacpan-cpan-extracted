Revision history for Perl module Text::Table::Tiny

1.00 2020-08-07 NEILB
    - Added align parameter, which can be used to set a common alignment
      for all columns, or per-column alignment.
    - Added style parameter, which takes values 'classic' (existing look),
      'boxrule' (for ANSI box rule characters), or 'norule', which can
      be think of tabular formatting.
    - Added compact parameter, which suppresses the space padding on either
      side of all columns.
    - Added indent parameter, which can take either a string, or an integer
      count of the number of spaces to prefix every row with.
    - Completely rewritten both code and documentation.
    - Back compat with original interface is still maintained (I think!),
      but it's not mentioned in the documentation.
    - Now handles TTY escape sequences, so you can color or otherwise highlight
      the text, and the column widths will still come out right.

    - Added a bunch of examples to the documentation
    - Mentioned in the doc that you need to binmode with boxrule style
    - Set Github issues as the bugtracker
    - Added boxrule examples to the doc, so want to do another dev
      release to whether they come out ok on MetaCPAN, etc.

    - The align parameter was still expecting previous idea of an 'lrc' string.
    - Can now specify a single alignment which applies to all columns.
    - Handle ANSI escape codes, so they don't mess up alignment

    - generate_table() was die'ing if no rows were passed, which resulted
      in a suboptimal error message. Now croaks; added fatal test for this.
    - Added top_and_tail param, to address GH#3.
    - deleted unused internal function _get_cols_and_rows(). Devel::Cover++
    - Enabled Travis-CI. PR from Petr Kletečka++.

    - Added this Changes file. Addresses RT#97285
    - Now use Exporter, and provide an optional export generate_table(),
      which works exactly the same as the previous table() function.
      The old interface is provided for back compat. Tests for new interface.
    - Restructured the doc.
    - Cleaned up the dist.ini, which now adds a META.json to releases.
    - Added a SEE ALSO section to the doc, which refers the reader to
      the See Also section in Text::Table::Manifold RT#107613.
    - Specified min perl version as 5.006
    - Github repo now listed in the doc and in the dist metadata
