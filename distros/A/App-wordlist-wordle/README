NAME
    App::wordlist::wordle - A wordlist wrapper to help solve Wordle

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.295 of App::wordlist::wordle (from
    Perl distribution App-wordlist-wordle), released on 2025-03-07.

FUNCTIONS
  wordlist_wordle
    Usage:

     wordlist_wordle(%args) -> [$status_code, $reason, $payload, \%result_meta]

    Help solve Wordle.

    Examples:

    *   One guess:

         wordlist_wordle(arg => ["cR^eEk"]);

    *   Five guesses:

         wordlist_wordle(arg => ["A^R^isE^", "Pound", "might", "blA^ck", "PR^ivY^"]);

    This is a wrapper to wordlist designed to be a convenient helper to
    solve Wordle puzzle. By default it greps from the "EN::Wordle" wordlist.
    It accepts a series of guesses in a format like the following:

     A^R^isE^
     Pound
     might
     blA^ck
     PR^ivY^

    where lowercase means wrong guess, uppercase means correct letter and
    position, while (uppercase) letter followed by a caret ("^") means the
    letter exists in another position. It will convert these guesses to
    regex patterns and the "--chars-unordered" option and pass it to
    "wordlist".

    This function is not exported.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   arg => *array[str]*

        (No description)

    *   color => *str* (default: "auto")

        When to highlight search string/matching pattern with color.

    *   detail => *bool*

        Display more information when listing modules/result.

        When listing installed modules ("-l"), this means also returning a
        wordlist's language.

        When returning grep result, this means also returning wordlist name.

    *   exclude_dynamic_wordlists => *bool*

        (No description)

    *   exclude_wordlist_pattern => *re_from_str*

        (No description)

    *   exclude_wordlists => *array[str]*

        Exclude wordlist modules.

    *   ignore_case => *bool* (default: 1)

        (No description)

    *   langs => *array[str]*

        Only include wordlists of certain language(s).

        By convention, language code is the first subnamespace of a wordlist
        module, e.g. WordList::EN::* for English, WordList::FR::* for
        French, and so on. Wordlist modules which do not follow this
        convention (e.g. WordList::Password::* or WordList::PersonName::*)
        are not included.

    *   len => *int* (default: 5)

        (No description)

    *   max_len => *int*

        (No description)

    *   min_len => *int*

        (No description)

    *   num => *int* (default: 0)

        Return (at most) this number of words (0 = unlimited).

    *   or => *bool*

        Instead of printing words that must match all queries (the default),
        print words that match any query.

    *   random => *bool*

        Pick random words.

        If set to true, then streaming will be turned off. All words will be
        gathered first, then words will be chosen randomly from the gathered
        list.

    *   wordlist_bundles => *array[str]*

        Select one or more wordlist bundle
        (Acme::CPANModules::WordListBundle::*) modules.

    *   wordlists => *array[str]* (default: ["EN::Wordle"])

        Select one or more wordlist modules.

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element ($status_code) is an integer containing HTTP-like status
    code (200 means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second
    element ($reason) is a string containing error message, or something
    like "OK" if status is 200. Third element ($payload) is the actual
    result, but usually not present when enveloped result is an error
    response ($status_code is not 2xx). Fourth element (%result_meta) is
    called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information, much like how HTTP response headers provide additional
    metadata.

    Return value: (any)

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR,
    Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps
    required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
