    * Album loading sometimes failed because certain Moose attributes were set
      to be required when they shouldn't have been. (HT: Riccardo Mativi)
    * Migrating it to use my regulate Dist::Zilla setup (mostly)
    * Reorganized the project layout a little bit
    * Cleaned up the code a bit
    * Added calls to make_immutable to all classes, which should spead things up
      slightly.
    * Added some more attributes to control some of the previously hardcoded
      bits (like Google's URL and which namespaces to map in the API).
    * Added the xml_text() method to the base class to give "official" access to
      the internals of certain elements passed back by Google, but haven't been
      mapped to an attribute yet..

      username/password to run these tests.  This will login to the given
      account and list some albums and photos.
    * Added the size attribute to Net::Google::PicasaWeb::Media to get the file
      size of the photo from the API, when presented.

      from base classes to make it easier to browser without having to navigate
      multiple manual pages. (Thanks Terrence Brannon)
    * Added geo-coding support to Net::Google::PicasaWeb::Album and
      Net::Google::PicasaWeb::Photo. This adds latitude and longitude attributes
      to these objects, when available. (Thanks Benjamin Thomas)
