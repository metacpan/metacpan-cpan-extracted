I begin this story with a neutral statement.
Basically this is a very silly test.
You are testing the Lingua::EN::Opinion package using short, inane sentences.
I am actually very happy today.
I have finally finished writing this package.
Tomorrow I will be very sad.
I won't have anything left to do.
I might get angry and decide to do something horrible.
I might destroy the entire package and start from scratch.
Then again, I might find it satisfying to have completed my this package.
You might even say it's beautiful!
