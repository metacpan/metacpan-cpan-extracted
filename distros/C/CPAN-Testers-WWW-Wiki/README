NAME
       CPAN::Testers::WWW::Wiki - The CPAN Testers Wiki website.

DESCRIPTION
       This distribution contains all the code used to run the CPAN Testers Wiki 
       website.

VHOST FILES
       The CPAN Testers Wiki website is built on top of the Labyrinth Website 
       Management System. As such, the code to drive the website is conatined 
       within the Labyrinth and
       associated plugin prerequisites. In order to define the website in terms 
       of functionality, layout and style, the files within the './vhost' 
       directory of this distribution
       should be installed into your web server's virtual host directory.

       Included in the distribution is a "vhost.conf" file, which contains the 
       virtual host settings to implement the site using the Apache Web Server.

       within the site. TinyMCE is distributed under the GNU Lesser General 
       Public License Version 2.1, and

CPAN TESTERS FUND
       CPAN Testers wouldn't exist without the help and support of the Perl 
       community. However, since 2008 CPAN Testers has grown far beyond the 
       expectations of it's original
       creators. As a consequence it now requires considerable funding to help 
       support the infrastructure.

       In early 2012 the Enlightened Perl Organisation very kindly set-up a CPAN 
       Testers Fund within their donatation structure, to help the project cover 
       the costs of servers and
       services.

       If you would like to donate to the CPAN Testers Fund, please follow the 
       link below to the Enlightened Perl Organisation's donation site.

       If your company would like to support us, you can donate financially via 
       the fund link above, or if you have servers or services that we might 
       use, please send an email to
       admin@cpantesters.org with details.
