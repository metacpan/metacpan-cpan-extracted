OpenOffice/OOBuilder version 0.07
=================================

This is a collection of modules to create OpenOffice documents. 
At this moment OpenOffice spreadsheets (calc documents) are 
supported. Other OpenOffice documents will follow depending 
on time and feedback. 

Bug reports and questions can be sent to <oobuilder(at)maygill.com>. 
Attention: make sure the word <oobuilder> is in the subject or 
body of your e-mail. Otherwhise your e-mail will be taken as 
spam and will not be read.

The modules present in this collection are:

  OpenOffice::OOBuilder - The base class. For each OpenOffice 
      document type, another class will be inherited from this
      base class.
      
  OpenOffice::OOCBuilder - For creating OpenOffice calc documents:
      spreadsheets, documents with the sxc extension.


PREREQUISITES

In order to install and use this package you will need Perl version
5.8.0 or better (although I don't expect problems with older versions, 
but I didn't test them).  

Other packages needed:  
  Archive::Zip
    If you don't want to use this, and you are on a Linux system with 
    access to a zip program, take a look at the OOBuilder.pm file, search
    for 'zip', and you will find some instructions how to change this.
    If you do so, please let me know. If enough people want this to be 
    an option, I'll try to implement that in one of the next releases.

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install
