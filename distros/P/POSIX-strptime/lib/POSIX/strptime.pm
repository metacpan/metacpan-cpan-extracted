=head1 NAME

POSIX::strptime - Perl extension to the POSIX date parsing strptime(3) function

=head1 SYNOPSIS

=head1 DESCRIPTION

=item strptime

 ($sec, $min, $hour, $mday, $mon, $year, $wday, $yday) = POSIX::strptime(string, format);

The result for any value not extracted is not defined. Some platforms may
reliably return C<undef>, but this is dependent on the C<strptime(3)> function
in the underlying C library.

For example, only the following fields may be relied upon:

 my ($min, $hour) = ( POSIX::strptime( "01:23", '%H:%M' ) )[1,2];
 
 my ($mday, $mon, $year) = ( POSIX::strptime( "2010/07/16", '%Y/%m/%d' ) )[3,4,5];

Furthermore, not all platforms will set the C<$wday> and C<$yday> elements. If
these values are required, use C<mktime> and C<gmtime>:

 use POSIX qw( mktime );
 use POSIX::strptime qw( strptime );

 my ($mday, $mon, $year) = ( POSIX::strptime( "2010/07/16", '%Y/%m/%d' ) )[3,4,5];
 my $wday = ( gmtime mktime 0, 0, 0, $mday, $mon, $year )[6];
