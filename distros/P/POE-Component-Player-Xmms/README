    For now, just $kernel->call these to get the return values. I will
    document these and add event replys for everything later.

EVENTS
    Events are fired at the session from which the *spawn()* method as
    called from. Currently there is only one event fired.

  xmms_started
    This event is fired by the player's notification that it's ready.
