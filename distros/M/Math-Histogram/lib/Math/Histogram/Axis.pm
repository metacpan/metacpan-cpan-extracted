=head1 NAME

Math::Histogram::Axis - Object representing single histogram dimension

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Math::Histogram;
  # 10 bins between 0 and 1
  my $fixed_bin = Math::Histogram::Axis->new(10, 0., 1.);
  # 5 bins of variable size
  my $var_bin = Math::Histogram::Axis->new([1, 2, 4, 8, 16]);
  
=head1 DESCRIPTION

An object of this class represents the binning information along one
dimension of an N-dimensional histogram. A 1-D histogram will require
one axis, a 2-D histogram two axises, etc. Axises can contain
a number of equal-sized bins (also referred to as fixed-bin axises in
other parts of the documentation) or a number of explicitly
specified variable-width bins. Some of the algorithms, most notably
the one for determining the bin number for a given coordinate,
will be O(1) for fixed-width binning, but O(log(n)) for variable-width
binning.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new

The constructor takes one or three arguments. With three arguments, the
axis will have fixed-width bins. The first argument is the number of
bins on the axis, the second is the lower boundary of the first bin,
the third is the upper boundary of the last bin.

One argument indicates a variable-width binning. The argument must
be a reference to an array of floating point numbers that increase
strictly monotonically. They are interpreted in order
as the lower boundary of the first bin, the boundary between first
and second bin, ... and finally the upper boundary of the last bin.
Given N elements of the array reference, the axis will have N-1 bins.

Bin numbers start at 1 since the bin with number 0 is the
underflow bin which technically has the range (-Infty., min),
so excluding the lower limit of the first bin.

=head2 clone

Returns a deep clone of the axis object.

=head2 nbins

Returns the number of bins on the axis.

=head2 min

Returns the lower boundary of the first bin of the axis.

=head2 max

Returns the upper boundary of the last bin of the axis.

=head2 width

Returns the total width of all bins combined. Yes,
that's simply C<$axis-E<gt>max - $axis-E<gt>min>.

=head2 binsize

Given a bin number, returns the width of that bin. Defaults to '1',
so for axis objects with fixed-width binning, calling this method without
argument is valid.

=head2 lower_boundary

Given a bin number, returns the lower boundary of that bin.

=head2 upper_boundary

Given a bin number, returns the upper boundary of that bin.

=head2 bin_center

Given a bin number, returns the center of that bin.

=head2 find_bin

Given a coordinate, finds the bin number of the bin it lies in.
Returns 0 for underflow and C<$nbins + 1> for overflow.

=head2 serialize

Returns a JSON string that represents this axis object.

=head2 deserialize

Class method. Given a JSON string as generated by C<serialize()>,
recreates the axis object that it represents. Also accepts a scalar
reference to a JSON string.
