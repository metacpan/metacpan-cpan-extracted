NAME
    Data::Header::Fields - encode and decode RFC822 header field lines

SYNOPSIS
            use IO::Any;
            my $email_msg = IO::Any->slurp([ 'path', 'to', 'email.eml' ]);
            my ($email_header, $email_body) = split(/^\s*$/m, $email_msg, 2);

            use Data::Header::Fields;
            my $dhf = Data::Header::Fields->new->decode(\$email_header);
            print 'From    - ', $dhf->get_value('From'), "\n";
            print 'Subject - ', $dhf->get_value('Subject'), "\n";
            print 'Date    - ', $dhf->get_value('Date'), "\n";
            print '--- cut ---', "\n";

            $dhf->set_value('To' => ' anyone@anywhere');
            $dhf->rm_fields('Received');
        
            print $dhf->encode();

DESCRIPTION
    RFC822 - Standard for ARPA Internet Text Messages
    (http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc822#section-3.2) describes the format of
    header lines used in emails. The tricky part is the line folding.

    There are some "forks" of this standard. One of them is Debian
    RFC-2822-like fields and the other is RFC2425 that defines the so called
    vCard format. Data::Header::Fields is generic enough to serve as a base
    class to parse those as well.

    One of the main goals of the module is to be able to edit the headers
    while keeping the lines that were not changed untouched.

    For the moment this is all documentation. After more tests with vCards
    and using this module for the basic parsing in Parse::Deb::Control it
    will be stable enough.

    Currently this distribution is highly radioactive!
