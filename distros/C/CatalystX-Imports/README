Installation

  You can install this module like any other perl module:

     perl Makefile.PL
     make
     make test
     make install

  Depending on your setup, you probably will need superuser
  privileges to run the last command.

  Note, however, that the installation via CPAN[1] is the
  recommended method for installing this module. Using CPAN will
  make sure that you install the latest version.
