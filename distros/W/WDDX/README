This module provides a perl interface to WDDX. The latest version of this
module as well as additional information can be found at
http://www.scripted.com/wddx/. For more information about WDDX please visit
http://www.wddx.org/.

This code is copyright 1999 by Scott Guelich. You may use and distribute 
this code according to the same terms that Perl is distributed.


INSTALL
-------

NOTE: These modules require the MIME::Base64 module, available at
<http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-module/MIME/> and XML::Parser, available
at <http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-module/XML/>. You can find help for
installing these modules at http://www.perl.com/CPAN/modules/INSTALL.html.

I have been told that recent distributions of ActiveState Perl include
both MIME::Base64 and XML::Parser, so Windows users should check before
downloading and installing them.

To install the WDDX modules, use CPAN.pm. If you can't use CPAN.pm,
then follow these steps:

 1. Expand the package using one of these commands:
     tar xvfz WDDX-*.tar.gz              # If your system has GNU tar
     gzip -cd WDDX-*.tar.gz | tar xvf -  # If your tar is gzip-challenged

 2. Run the following series of commands:
     cd WDDX-*
     perl Makefile.PL
     make
     make test

 3. You must do this step as superuser:
     make install

If you do not have superuser priveleges and your sysadmin is too unfriendly
to install this for you, then you can install this module in another
location by replacing "perl Makefile.PL" from step 2 with this (replace
/home/USER/lib with some directory on your system that you can write to):

    perl Makefile.PL LIB=/home/USER/lib

You can then run "make", "make test", and"make install" yourself to have
the module installed in the specified lib directory. If you do override
the install directory this way, you will need to add the following line
to the top of your scripts:

    use lib "/home/USER/lib";


Manual Install
--------------

If your system does not support 'make', then you can manually copy
WDDX.pm and the WDDX folder to the site_perl folder in your Perl lib
folder.


Usage
-----

Refer to the POD in WDDX.pm for usage and more information.

If you find any problems or have any comments, please contact Andy
Lester at andy@petdance.com. You can also find all sorts of WDDX help
and resources at www.wddx.org, especially in the WDDX Forums.

Have fun.
