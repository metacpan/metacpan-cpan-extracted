NAME
    Devel::XRay - See What a Perl Module Is Doing

VERSION
    Version 0.95

SYNOPSIS
    use Devel::XRay along with "ignore", "only", or "all",

        use Devel::XRay;
        use Devel::XRay 'all';    # same as saying 'use Devel::XRay;'
        use Devel::XRay 'none';   # filter the source but don't inject anything
        use Devel::XRay ignore => qw(man_behind_curtain private);
        use Devel::XRay only   => qw(sex drugs rock_and_roll);

DESCRIPTION
    Devel::XRay is a handy source filter using Filter::Simple when used at
    the top of perl code, will inject print statements to standard error to
    show you what a module is doing.

    This module is useful if...

    *   You're a visual learner and want to "see" program execution

    *   You're tracking an anomaly that leads you into unfamiliar code

    *   You want to quickly see how a module _runs_

    *   You've inherited code and need to grok it

    *   You start a new job and want to get a fast track on how things work

EXAMPLES
        #!/usr/bin/perl
        use strict;
        use warnings;
        use Devel::XRay;

        use Example::Object;

        init();
        my $example = Example::Object->new();
        my $name = $example->name();
        my $result = $example->calc();
        cleanup();

        sub init    {}
        sub cleanup {}

        # In a another file, say Example/Object.pm
        package Example::Object;
        use Devel::XRay;
        sub new { bless {}, shift }
        sub name {}
        sub calc {}

    Produces the following output

        # Hires seconds     # package::sub
        [1092265261.834574] main::init
        [1092265261.836732] Example::Object::new
        [1092265261.837563] Example::Object::name
        [1092265261.838245] Example::Object::calc
        [1092265261.839443] main::cleanup

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
    This module was inspired by Damian Conway's Sufficently Advanced
    Technology presentation at YAPC::NA 2004. I had initially attempted to
    use Hook::LexWrap, but using Filter::Simple was just a lot cleaner and
    seemed a bit more practical for debugging code. The first iteration was
    only 2 lines of actual code.

        package Devel::XRay;
        use strict;
        use warnings;
        use Filter::Simple;

        my $code = 'print STDERR (caller(0))[3] . "\n";';
        FILTER { return unless $_; $_ =~ s/(sub.+?{)/$1 $code/sg; }

    I'd also like to thank fellow SouthFlorida.pm member Rocco Caputo for
    working out the import logic over Sub Etha Edit at OSCON. Rock on Rocco!
