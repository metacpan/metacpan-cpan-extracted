      $ chit chat "What if I mix blue and yellow?"
      Mixing blue and yellow produces green. The exact shade of green can vary
      depending on the proportions of blue and yellow used.
  
      $ chit chat "Can you write a haiku about that colour?"
      Blue and yellow blend,
      Nature's hue emerges bright,
      Verdant whispers sing.
  
      $ chit chat "What were we just talking about?"
      We were discussing the color produced by mixing blue and yellow, which
      is green. I also wrote a haiku about that color. If you have more
      questions or want to talk about something else, feel free to let me
      know!
