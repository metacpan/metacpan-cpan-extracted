     Fix entry point in pmv script.

2.00 Dec 14 2020

     API CHANGED: Transform subroutines must now operate on their
     (single) argument and return the result.

     Main routine is now pmv(), and exported by default.
     File::PerlMove::move can be used as a legacy call with the old
     API.

     Handle lc, uc and ucfirst as builtins. Add tc.

     Allow extensions by defining custom transformation routines in
     File::PerlMove::XXX modules.
