INSTALLING
==========

Look at the INSTALL file.

WHAT IS CHRONOS?
================

Chronos is a Web agenda/calendar for Intranets (even if it can be used from
anywhere). It can send reminders by email. You can schedule multi-user events.
It is fast and light on resources (the balance size/speed can be tweaked by
tweaking mod_perl and Apache).

WHY WRITE YET ANOTHER WEB AGENDA?
=================================

All others are one of these:
    - Proprietary
    - Ugly
    - Broken/buggy

Chronos is not
    - Proprietary
    - Ugly
    - Broken/buggy

Chronos is released under the GPL (see the file COPYING to understand what it
means to release a software under the GPL). Linux Québec Technologies is the
copyright holder and is backing the development of this software. Chronos's look is 
based on Prospector, whose look is based on Sun's agenda. The look has been enhanced
with the power of style sheets, while always being careful to stay as close as
possible to HTML 4.01.

The following browsers are compatible with HTML 4.01 and
CSS2 and therefore can be used to view Chronos as it was intended to be viewed:
    - Mozilla 1.0+
    - Internet Explorer 5.5+
The following browsers can display Chronos relatively correctly, though some
features will look uglier:
    - Konqueror 3.0
    - Internet Explorer 5.0
    - Opera 6.0
These browsers are too old/dumb and therefore Chronos looks ugly on them:
    - Netscape 4.x
Other browsers have not been tested. Send email to
chronoss-devel@lists.sourceforge.net if you want one of them to be included in
this list. Note that all browsers should be able to at least display Chronos as
we try to be standards-compliant. Particularly, text browsers can be used to
access Chronos.

Lastly, Chronos is not buggy. All time calculations are done with Date::Calc. You
will _not_ find yourself clicking on the first of the next month and getting
sent to the first of the current month. And Chronos benefits from the Open
Source movement: many eyes can fix many bugs. If you find a bug (even if Chronos
is definitively *not* buggy), send email to chronoss-devel@lists.sourceforge.net.
It should be squashed within a day.

THIS RELEASE
============

1.1.6 features the new Dutch translation (thanks to Remco B. Brink
<remco@rc6.org>!!) along with some bugfixes. As usual, check the ChangeLog for
details.

Chronos is currently available in the following languages:
    - English
    - French
    - Italian (incomplete)
    - German
    - Norwegian
    - Portuguese
    - Swedish
    - Dutch

OLDER RELEASES
==============

1.1.5: New icons, new Swedish translation, couple of bugfixes, URLs and email
addresses highlighted as clickable links, and others.

1.1.4.2 fixes another major bug that would cause the date at the top of a day
view to be always today.

1.1.4.1 fixes a major bug that would print 0:00 for any event in month and week
views.

New Portuguese translation by Augusto Cesar Sandoval. Cosmetic and non-cosmetic
bugfixes. Most date formats are now customizable. It is now possible to run
multiple Chronos servers on the same system. More user-friendly confirmation
email.

remindd simply didn't work in 1.1.2, it does now in 1.1.3. Sorry.

1.1.2 brings minor bugfixes and visual enhancements. Apache::DBI does not
complain anymore, meaning that Chronos is installable by CPAN and installation
will be overall easier.

1.1.1 fixes some minor bugs that inevitably appear in .0 releases.

1.1.0 brings major feature enhancements: file attachments, participant
management, events with no time associated, more intuitive status management and
locale-dependant holidays. Minor documentation, installation and look issues
have also been fixed.

1.0.4 features two new translations: German by Peer Oliver Schmidt and Norwegian
by Tarjei Knapstad. Minor installation bugs have been squashed.

1.0.3 introduces the Italian translation by Enzo Bontempo, fixes some language
issues and minor display glitches. This could be the last 1.0.x release, unless
translations for other languages get written.

1.0.2 fixes some language issues (sorry English speakers), has better
installation instructions and an easter egg.

1.0.1 is an early release. It is fully working but lacks documentation. This
will be addressed in 1.0.2, which should be out shortly. Also, this software was
developed by French-speaking people so there may be some artifacts of that in
various places in the code. This will surely disappear over time.

1.0 was fully working but a few cosmetic bugs had to be ironed out.

FUTURE RELEASES
===============

1.2.0 will have the following features:
    - Week starting on Sunday and 5-day work week
    - Palm Pilot integration

Future plans/dreams:
    - Ability to choose from different stylesheets (themeability!)
    - SMS reminders
    - Send reminder to address ____________
    - WinPopup/ICQ/AIM/MSN (maybe)/Yahoo/Jabber reminders
