NAME

    Test2::Tools::MemoryCycle - Check for memory leaks and circular memory
    references

VERSION

    version 0.01

SYNOPSIS

     use Test2::V0;
     use Test2::Tools::MemoryCycle;
    
     my $foo = { bar => 1 };
     
     memory_cycle_ok $foo;  # pass
     
     $foo->{baz} = sub {
       print $foo->{bar}, "\n";
     };
    
     memory_cycle_ok $foo;  # fail
    
     done_testing;

DESCRIPTION

    Perl's garbage collection has one big problem: Circular references
    can't get cleaned up. The above example is the sort of thing that
    sometimes trips me up, where a code reference inside a data structure
    refers to another part of the data structure. There already exists a
    good testing module to find these sort of problems:
    Test::Memory::Cycle, so why write this one? Well that module uses
    Test::Builder, and this one instead uses Test2::API. If you want to
    write Test2::Suite tests without pulling in Test::Builder then this is
    the cycle testing module for you.

    This module also uses the standard Exporter interface, instead of
    letting you specify a test plan. That behavior was once in vogue I
    guess, but I do not care for it.

FUNCTIONS

 memory_cycle_ok

     memory_cycle_ok $reference, $message;
     memory_cycle_ok $reference;

    Checks that $reference doesn't have any circular memory references.

CAVEATS

    This module is based on and quite similar to Test::Memory::Cycle. That
    module is more mature, and has more features. So far I only need the
    one test function. Other features may be added in the future.
