Revision history for CtrlO::PDF

0.33 Tue Jul 8 2025

    * Widow support for tables - thanks Sam Kington
    * Includes better spacing support for tables wrapping over pages and fixes
      exceptions when table header spans pages

0.32 Wed Mar 3 2025

    * Prevent infinite loop if unable to print text to PDF

0.31 Wed Apr 5 2023

    * Start new page if not enough space for initial text

0.30 Mon Jan 20 2023

    * Remove support for PDF::API2, greatly simplifying the code
    * Remove requirement for PDF::TextBlock, use PDF::Builder instead
    * Fix inability to use negative values when setting y position
    * Round top margin to whole number

0.20 Mon Feb 1 2021

    * Many minor tweaks to make default page layout better. This breaks
      previous formatting, hence the version number, but means much
      easier and tidier content layout by default.
    * Fix first words being chopped when no room on page for para
    * Add image alignment option
    * Fix word spacing in headings

0.10 Sat Jan 30 2021

    * Fix problems with the color of text
    * Require minimum PDF::TextBlock version

0.09 Tue Jan 26 2021

    * Further workaround for words that are too long, when they don't have
      any more words after them

0.08 Wed Jan 06 2021

    * remove PDF::API2 as a prerequisite, allowing PDF::Builder to be used
      (and if absent, look for PDF::API2). The PDFlib option can be used to
      specify either PDF::API2 or PDF::Builder (the default) as your PDF
      support library.
    * PDF::API2 removed as an installation prerequisite (either PDF::API2 or
      PDF::Builder is needed to run). If neither is installed, Makefile.PL 
      will install PDF::Builder (easily configured which).
    * use README.md instead of README, to get formatting
    * Fix infinite loop if text is too long to fit on one-line. This fix
      implements a workaround, which removes the word that is too long, carps,
      and then continues.

0.07 Tue Dec 22 2020

    * minor corrections and cleanup to make POD and README consistent
    * make example (POD, README) fully working, save out.pdf file
    * put example (ctrlo.pl) and logo.png into new sample/ directory
    * update version number in META.json and META.yml

0.06 Tue Nov 24 2020

    * Add header option
    * Reduce bottom margin if no footer defined

0.05 Thu Jul 2 2020

    * Automatically add space for logo whenever starting new page
    * Make sure space for table if at end of page
    * Add size option to text
    * Add move_y_position and change name of current_y
    * Add options to get and set y position
    * Add indent option

0.04 Tue Oct 1 2019

    * Fix uninitialized value warning when no logo specified (thanks Mike West)

0.03 Fri Apr 26 2019

    * Another attempt to add the missing font files

0.02 Mon Apr 15 2019

    * Fix failing test due to missing default font (thanks Tom Hukins). A
      better longer term solution would probably allow the module to not depend
      on any fonts - PRs welcome.

0.01 Sun Aug 12 2018

    * Initial release
