App-IniDiff

App-IniDiff is a package of Perl utilities that compares,
patches and filters INI files.

It works much as the GNU diffutils package works, but taking 
the INI structure of section, key and values into account.

Originally Developed by Michael Rendell, Memorial University of Newfoundland
as part of the regutils package, for maintaining Win95 diskless workstations,
which is still available here: https://sourceforge.net/projects/regutils/

App-IniDiff can be used to help in managing INI configuration files.
The utilities can be used to apply changes to INIs as needed.
They can also be used to identify and correct similarities and 
differences between configurations. These may be helpful in debug 
situations or when consistency or differences need to be maintained.

The package contains the following programs:

    inicat    - cat ini files to standard output.
    inidiff   - generate the differences between two ini files.
    iniedit   - edit (or patch) a ini file.
    inifilter - filter an ini file by making substitutions
		        and deletions to keys and entries.
