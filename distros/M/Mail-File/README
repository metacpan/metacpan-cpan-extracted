Mail-File
=========

DESCRIPTION

This module was written to overcome the problem of sending mail messages, 
where there is no mail application available. 

The aim of the module is to write messages to a text file, that will format
the contents to include all the key elements of the message, such that the 
file can be transported to another machine, which is then capable of sending 
mail messages.

DEPENDENCIES

The distribution requires the following modules:

  File::Basename
  File::Path
  File::Temp
  Time::Piece

For testing purposes, the following modules are required:

  IO::File
  Test::More

For testing purposes, the following modules are desireable, but not essential:

  Pod::Coverage

INSTALLATION

CPAN TESTING

This module was initially written to aid me in the CPAN Testing experience
(see http://cpantesters.org for further details). Unfortunately the machine
I was testing on didn't have sendmail or SMTP access, so I needed to store
plain text mails to send later.
