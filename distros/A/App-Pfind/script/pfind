=head1 NAME

B<pfind> - A Perl based I<find> replacement

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  pfind dir1 dir2 ... [--exec perl_code]

The program recursively crawls through all the directories listed on its command
line and execute some piece of perl code on each files and directories that
are encountered.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

TODO

See examples of B<pfind> in action below, in the L</EXAMPLES> section.

=head1 OPTIONS

All the options below can be abbreviated down to uniqueness and be supplied in
any order. Input files and directories can be mixed in with the options. Options
processing can be stopped with the B<--> flag, all remaining arguments will be
considered input files.

=over 4

=item B<-e> I<code>, B<--exec>

Execute the given piece of code for each file and directory encountered by the
program. The program will C<chdir> into each directory being crawled before
calling your code and the C<$_> variable will contain the base name of the
current file or directory. In addition, the C<$dir> variable will contain the
directory name of the current file and C<$name> will contain the full name of
the file (more or less C<$dir> concatenated with C<$_>).

The code can also call the C<prune> method to skip recursing into the current
directory. This has no effect if called while looking at a file. This cannot be
used if the B<--depth-first> option is passed. This does not interupt the
execution of the code for the current directory or file.

You will typically uses the code to perform tests on the given file and some
sort of actions depending on the result of the tests. See L</EXAMPLES> below.

This option can be passed multiple times. However, multiple pieces of code given
to this option will not be independant: they will share the same variables and
if C<return> is called by a piece of code, no more code will be executed for the
current file. However the keyword C<next> can be used to jump to the next piece
of code to be executed.

One exception is that the C<$_>, C<$dir>, and C<$name> variables are saved and
each piece of coce will initially see the correct values. The variables can be
modified but the next pieces of code executed after the current one will not see
the modification.

=item B<-d>, B<--depth-first>

When this option is passed, the code given to B<--exec> will be called first for
the content of a directory and then for the directory itself (this is a depth
first approach). By default, the code is executed first for a directory and then
for its content.

Using this option might be required if you're planning on changing the name of a
directory.

The opposite option is B<--no-depth-first> (or B<--nod>).

=item B<-f>, B<--follow>

When this option is passed, symlinks are followed (by default they are treated
as files but not followed).

=item B<-ff>, B<--follow-fast>

Same as B<--follow> but faster. However, with this option, it is possible that
some files will be processed twice if the symlinks for some kind of cycles.

The B<--follow> and B<--follow-fast> options are mutually exclusive.

=item B<--chdir>

When this option is set (which is the default), the program will C<chdir> into
each directory being crawled before calling your code.

This behavior can be deactivated with the opposite option B<--no-chdir>. In this
case, during the execution of the code passed to B<--exec>, the C<$_> variable
will contain the full path to the current file (same as the C<$name> variable).
That name will be absolute or relative, depending on whether the starting
directory given on the command line has been given with an absolute or relative
path.

=item B<-p> I<text>, B<--print>

Print the argument of this function after each call of the Perl C<print>
function. This defaults to a new-line. Technically this option is setting the
C<$\> variable in Perl.

=item B<-B> I<code>, B<--BEGIN>

Specify a piece of code that is executed before starting to crawl the
directories. That code can set-up variables and functions to be used later by
the code passed to B<--exec>.

This option can be passed several times. Each piece of code will be called in
order.

=item B<-E> I<code>, B<--END>

Similar to the B<--BEGIN> option, but the passed code will be executed after all
the crawling is done.

=item B<--pre> I<code>, B<--pre-process>

Execute the given piece of code each time a directory is entered. The name of
the current directory is in the variables C<$_> and C<$dir>. If B<--chdir> is in
effect (the default), then the current directory is already set to that
directory.

This option cannot be used together with B<--follow> or B<--follow-fast>.

Note: the matching option in the underlying C<File::Find> Perl library support
modifying which files of the directory will be used. This is not supported by
B<pfind>.

=item B<--post> I<code>, B<--post-process>

Execute the given piece of code just before exiting each processed directory.
The name of the (still) current directory is in the variables C<$_> and C<$dir>.
If B<--chdir> is in effect (the default), then the current directory is still
set to that directory.

This option cannot be used together with B<--follow> or B<--follow-fast>.

=item B<-h>, B<--help>

Print this help message and exits. Note: the help message printed will be much
improved if you have the B<perldoc> program installed (sometimes from a
B<perl-doc> package).

=item B<--version>

Print the version of the program and exit.

=back

=head1 EXAMPLES

A default invocation of the program without arguments other than directories and
files will as the B<find> program, printing the recursive content of all the
listed directories and files:

  pfind dir1 dir2 dir3

By default, pfind C<chdir> into each directory, so the only the base name of the
files is printed. With the B<--no-chdir> option, the full name of the files is
printed:

  pfind --no-chdir dir1 dir2 dir3

This example will print the name of all the files and directories that it sees
but it will skip the content of hidden directories and hidden directories
themselves:

  pfind -e 'if (/^\..+/) { prune; return }' -e 'print $name' dir...

This example prints the name of all symbolic links whose targets are invalid:

  pfind -e 'print $name if -l && !-e'
