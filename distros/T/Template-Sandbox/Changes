        COMPAT BUSTERS:

        Version started at  2010-02-03-05:40.
        Do not discard drive letter when building current_dir for includes

        Version started at  2010-01-28-21:22.
        Previous issue was _really_ that $current_dir shouldn't have
        been undefined in the first place... silly path-finding regexp.
        Now uses File::Spec for all directory/filename fiddling.

1.01_08 Version released at 2010-01-28-21:07.  *** Development version. ***
        Version started at  2010-01-28-21:02.

        Correct line/character numbers for changes from define replacement.

        Retired <: for iterator=x set=y :> syntax.
        Moved void-wrap of assigns from optimization to compile phase.
        Preallocate large string to template output string for speed.
        Tightened main instruction loop in run().
        Removed unused $total_instr variable.
        Unroll of top of variable stack into own variable during execution.
        Evil evil and thrice evil optimizations to _eval_var().
        Use faster procedural rather than OO interface to Digest::MD5().
        Push count of program length into compile rather than runtime.
        Push count of variable segment length into compile from eval.

1.01_06 Version released at 2010-01-04-13:40.  *** Development version. ***
        Version started at  2009-12-31-17:43.
        Correction to broken position character counting after newlines.
        _optimize_template() no longer takes args or returns one.
        Added clarification to FastMmap caching benchmarks in POD.

        Version started at  2009-12-29-11:14.
        COMPAT BUSTER: $current_dir no-longer defaults to Cwd::cwd() when
            find_template() is called, instead an undef value will be passed:
            if you need the cwd you can work it out yourself. :)
        Removed dependency on Cwd.
        Store special loop vars as array rather than hash.
        Only build special loop vars if any are needed by loop.
        Added tests for special loop var optimizations.
        Added tests for subscript access of special vars. (var['__prev__']).
        Added "case-study" style snippets to caching documentation.
        Added benchmark dump to performance section.

1.01_03 Version released at 2009-12-09-22:19.  *** Development version. ***
        Version started at  2009-12-09-20:14.
        Knew those unixy file paths in the tests' error-match regexps
        would bite me eventually:
            made the error text tests properly OS-agnostic.
        Remembered to update coverage stats this time.

        Version started at  2009-12-08-08:29.
        Release focus: optimizing the compile and optimization phases.
        Major optimization to jump target renumbering in template optimization.
        Only call _delete_instr() when actually needed.  Doh.
        Prebuild list of jump-targets for speed when merging adjacent literals.
        Correctly made FUNC_NEEDS_TEMPLATE a constant sub.
        Use tr/// instead of m// for newline-counting during compile.
        Replace nasty array munging during compile with splice().
        Moved a few regexp compiles outside the loops using them.

1.01_01 Version released at 2009-10-07-10:48.  *** Development version. ***
        Version started at  2009-09-10-13:25.
        No-longer assumes english-localized perl error text in tests.
