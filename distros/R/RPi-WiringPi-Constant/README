NAME

    RPi::WiringPi::Constant - Constant variables for RPi::WiringPi

SYNOPSIS

        # THIS DISTRIBUTION IS DEPRECATED. PLEASE SEE THE "DESCRIPTION" SECTION
    
        use RPi::WiringPi::Constant (:all);
    
        # or...
    
        use RPi::WiringPi::Constant (:pinmode);
    
        # etc

DESCRIPTION

    THIS DISTRIBUTION/MODULE IS DEPRECATED. It'll continue to install and
    work, but it will not be updated or maintained further.

    PLEASE USE RPi::Const FOR ANY PROJECTS MOVING FORWARD. If current
    projects break due to the use of this distribution, please switch over
    to RPi::Const.

    This module optionally exports selections or all constant variables
    used within the RPi::WiringPi suite.

CONSTANT EXPORT TAGS

    These are the individual grouping of export tags. The :all tag includes
    all of the below.

 :mode

    Setup modes. This is what determines which pin numbering scheme you're
    using. See wiringPi setup modes <http://wiringpi.com/reference/setup>
    for details.

        RPI_MODE_WPI      =>  0, # wiringPi scheme
        RPI_MODE_GPIO     =>  1, # GPIO scheme
        RPI_MODE_GPIO_SYS =>  2, # GPIO scheme in SYS mode
        RPI_MODE_PHYS     =>  3, # physical pin layout scheme
        RPI_MODE_UNINIT   => -1, # setup not yet run

 :pinmode

    Pin modes.

        INPUT            => 0,
        OUTPUT           => 1,
        PWM_OUT          => 2,
        GPIO_CLOCK       => 3,
        SOFT_PWM_OUTPUT  => 4,  # reserved
        SOFT_TONE_OUTPUT => 5,  # reserved
        PWM_TONE_OUTPUT  => 6,  # reserved

 :altmode

    Pin ALT modes.

        ALT0 => 4,
        ALT1 => 5,
        ALT2 => 6,
        ALT3 => 7,
        ALT4 => 3,
        ALT5 => 2,

 :pull

    Internal pin pull up/down resistor state.

        PUD_OFF  => 0,
        PUD_DOWN => 1,
        PUD_UP   => 2,

 :state

        HIGH => 1,
        LOW  => 0,
        ON   => 1,
        OFF  => 0,

 :pwm_mode

    The modes the PWM can be set to.

        PWM_MODE_MS  => 0,
        PWM_MODE_BAL => 1,

 :interrupt

    Edge detection states for interrupts.

        EDGE_SETUP   => 0,  # reserved
        EDGE_FALLING => 1,
        EDGE_RISING  => 2,
        EDGE_BOTH    => 3,
