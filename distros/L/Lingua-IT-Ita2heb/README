Lingua-IT-Ita2heb

This is a module for transliterating Italian words into Hebrew.

It is supposed to be useful for transliterating names of people and places.

It manages to get many words correctly, but don't count on it to be right
about <z>, semi-vowel <i>, and some other quirks of Italian spelling.

Corrections, comments, suggestions and test-cases are welcome.
