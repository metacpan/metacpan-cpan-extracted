NAME

    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::OurPkgVersion - No line insertion and does Package
    version with our

VERSION

    version 0.21

SYNOPSIS

    in dist.ini

            [OurPkgVersion]

    in your modules

            # VERSION

DESCRIPTION

    This module was created as an alternative to
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::PkgVersion and uses some code from that module.
    This module is designed to use a the more readable format our $VERSION
    = $version; as well as not change then number of lines of code in your
    files, which will keep your repository more in sync with your CPAN
    release. It also allows you slightly more freedom in how you specify
    your version.

 EXAMPLES

    in dist.ini

            ...
            version = 0.01;
            [OurPkgVersion]

    in lib/My/Module.pm

            package My::Module;
            # VERSION
            ...

    output lib/My/Module.pm

            package My::Module;
            our $VERSION = '0.01'; # VERSION
            ...

    please note that whitespace before the comment is significant so

            package My::Module;
            BEGIN {
                    # VERSION
            }
            ...

    becomes

            package My::Module;
            BEGIN {
                    our $VERSION = '0.01'; # VERSION
            }
            ...

    while

            package My::Module;
            BEGIN {
            # VERSION
            }
            ...

    becomes

            package My::Module;
            BEGIN {
            our $VERSION = '0.01'; # VERSION
            }
            ...

    you can also add additional comments to your comment

            ...
            # VERSION: generated by DZP::OurPkgVersion
            ...

    becomes

            ...
            our $VERSION = '0.1.0'; # VERSION: generated by DZP::OurPkgVersion
            ...

    you can also use perltidy's default static side comments (##)

            ...
            ## VERSION
            ...

    becomes

            ...
            our $VERSION = '0.1.0'; ## VERSION
            ...

    Also note, the package line is not in any way significant, it will
    insert the our $VERSION line anywhere in the file before # VERSION as
    many times as you've written # VERSION regardless of whether or not
    inserting it there is a good idea. OurPkgVersion will not insert a
    version unless you have # VERSION so it is a bit more work.

    If you make a trial release, the comment will be altered to say so:

            # VERSION

    becomes

            our $VERSION = '0.01'; # TRIAL VERSION

METHODS

    BUILD

      Provides validations after object creation.

    munge_files

      Override the default provided by Dist::Zilla::Role::FileMunger to
      limit the number of files to search to only be modules and
      executables.

    munge_file

      tells which files to munge, see Dist::Zilla::Role::FileMunger.

    finder

      Override the default FileFinder for finding files to check and
      update. The default value is :InstallModules and :PerlExecFiles (when
      available; otherwise :ExecFiles) -- see also
      Dist::Zilla::Plugin::ExecDir, to make sure the script files are
      properly marked as executables for the installer.

PROPERTIES

    underscore_eval_version

      For version numbers that have an underscore in them, add this line
      immediately after the our version assignment:

              $VERSION = eval $VERSION;

      This is arguably the correct thing to do, but changes the line
      numbering of the generated Perl module or source, and thus optional.

    semantic_version

      Setting this property to "true" (1) will set the version of the
      module/distribution to properly use semantic versioning. It will also
      expect that you setup version with a v-string, without adding quotes.
      For example:

              version = v0.0.1

      Beware you can't setup both underscore_eval_version and
      semantic_version since both are mutually exclusive: if you try, your
      code is going to die.

      For more details, check this blog
      <https://weblog.bulknews.net/how-to-correctly-use-semantic-version-vx-y-z-in-perl-modules-eb08568ab911>
      for more details about using semantic version with Perl.

    skip_main_module

      Set to true to ignore the main module in the distribution. This
      prevents a warning when using
      Dist::Zilla::Plugin::VersionFromMainModule to obtain the version
      number instead of the dist.ini file.

    overwrite

      When enabled, this option causes any match of the # VERSION comment
      to first check for an existing our $VERSION = ...; on the same line,
      and if found, overwrite the value in the existing statement. (the
      comment still gets modified for trial releases)

      Currently, the value must be a single Perl token such as a string or
      number.

    no_critic

      When underscore_eval_version is used the generated code for dev
      versions may not technically be Perl::Critic compliant due to string
      eval, but is nevertheless pretty safe. This option will add the
      appropriate no critic directive to save you the hassle.
