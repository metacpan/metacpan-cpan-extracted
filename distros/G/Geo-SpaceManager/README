NAME
    Geo::SpaceManager - Place rectangles without overlap

SYNOPSIS

    use Geo::SpaceManager;

    $sm = Geo::SpaceManager->new([0,0,100,100]);
    my $r1 = [10,10,40,30];
    my $r2 = [20,20,60,40];
    my $r3 = [50,10,80,70];
    my $r4 = [20,50,90,90];
    my $p1 = $sm->nearest($r1);  # returns [10,10,40,30];
    $sm->add($p1);
    my $p2 = $sm->nearest($r2);  # returns [20,30,60,50];
    $sm->add($p2);
    my $p3 = $sm->nearest($r3);  # returns [60,10,90,70]
    $sm->add($p3);
    my $p4 = $sm->nearest($r4);  # returns undef


DESCRIPTION
    Geo::SpaceManager keeps track of the free space available in a
    two-dimensional space as upright (non-rotated) rectangles are
    added. The module can find the nearest available location where
    a rectangle may be placed or indicate that the rectangle cannot
    be placed in any of the remaining free space.

    Rectangles are specified by references to four-element arrays
    giving the boundaries of the rectangle:

      [ left, bottom, right, top ]

    Reflected boundary values may be used by swapping left <-> right
    and top <-> bottom when specifying rectangles, but the return
    value of nearest() will return a value as shown above.

CONSTRUCTOR
  new
    The new() constructor should be called with the rectangle
    representing the entire free space to be managed. A second,
    optional argument turns debugging on if it has a true value.

        my $sm = Geo::SpaceManager->new( [0, 0, 100, 100] );
        my $sm_debug = Geo::SpaceManager->new( [0, 0, 100, 100], 1 );
    
METHODS
  set_minimum_size
    Set the minimum size for rectangles to be added.

    The following all set the minimum size of rectangles to (10,20):

      $sm->set_minimum_size([10,20]);
      $sm->set_minimum_size([0,0,10,20]);
      $sm->set_minimum_size([10,30,20,50]);
      $sm->set_minimum_size([20,50,10,30]);

    Setting a minimum size means that SpaceManager can be more
    efficient in space and time by discarding free-space areas if
    they are too small to contain any more rectangles of the minimum
    size.

    You should set the minimum size before adding any rectangles and
    not change it afterwards with another call to set_minimum_size.

  add
    Add a rectangle to the current free space.

      $sm->add( [10,20,50,40] );

    The free space will be reduced by the rectangle. The method
    returns 1 if successful and undef on failure. The only failures
    will be if the rectangle argument is missing or if it lies
    entirely outside of the space.

  nearest
    Find the nearest location in which to place the specified
    rectangle.

      $r = $sm->nearest([10,30,30,50]);

    The method will return a reference to an array of four scalars
    specifying a rectangle of the same size as the supplied one that
    fits wholly into an available free space if space can be found.
    The rectangle will be a copy of the provided one if it fits as
    is. The method will return undef if there is no free space that
    can contain the supplied rectangle.

  distance
    Return the distance between two (x,y) points or two rectangles.

      $dist = $sm->distance( $rect1, $rect2 );
      $dist = $sm->distance( [0,0], [3,4] );        # returns 5

    Calculate the distance between the two arguments, which should
    be references to arrays with at least two elements. Only the
    first two elements will be used, so you may pass refereces to
    two arrays with four elements that represent rectangles. This
    method may be used to find how far away the nearest available
    location is from a desired rectangle placement location.

      $s = $sm->nearest($r);
      $d = $sm->distance($r,$s);
      print "nearest available location is $d units away\n";
        
  dump
      $sm->dump()

    Print out the current set of free-space rectangles to standard
    output. The area of each rectangle is also printed.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
    The algorithm used is based on that described by Bernard and
    Jacquenet in "Free space modeling for placing rectangles without
    overlap" which appeared in the Journal of Universal Computer
    Science, vol. 3, no. 6, 1997. See
    http://www.jucs.org/jucs_3_6/free_space_modeling_for

    The term "space manager" was used by Bell and Feiner in their
    paper "Dynamic Space Management for User Interfaces", Proc. UIST
    '00, San Diego, CA, November 5-8 2000. pp. 239-248.

LIMITATIONS
    The algorithm used is first-come-first-served and makes no
    attempt at optimization such as minimum displacements. The first
    rectangle placed will occupy its desired location, while others
    may have to be moved, farther and farther as more are placed.

    There is no method for removing rectangles and restoring the
    space they occupied. Doing so is not trivial and remains the
    goal of a later update to this module, if there turns out to be
    a demand for such a feature. See the Bell and Feiner paper cited
    above for details on how this could be done.

    This module does in theory handle the placement of overlapping
    rectangles. You can place a rectangle that overlaps a
    rectangle that was already added and was, therefore, not
    returned by a call to the nearest method. The module should
    reduce the free space correctly in this case. However, this
    feature has not been thoroughly tested and there may still be
    bugs. It is safest to add only rectangles that have been
    returned from the nearest method.
