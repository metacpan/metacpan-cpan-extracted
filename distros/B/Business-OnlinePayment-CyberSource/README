DESCRIPTION
    For detailed information see Business::OnlinePayment.

METHODS
  BUILD
    this is a before-construction hook for Moose. You Will never call this
    method directly.

SUPPORTED TRANSACTION TYPES
  CC
    Content required: type, login, action, amount, first_name, last_name,
    card_number, expiration.

    cvv2 is required in order to get back a cvv2_response value.

  Settling
    To settle an authorization-only transaction (where you set action to
    "Authorization Only"), submit the "order_number" code in the field
    "po_number" with the action set to "Post Authorization".

    You can get the transaction id from the authorization by calling the
    "order_number" method on the object returned from the authorization. You
    must also submit the amount field with a value less than or equal to the
    amount specified in the original authorization.
