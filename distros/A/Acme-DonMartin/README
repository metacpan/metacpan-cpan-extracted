PREREQUISITES

This module requires the following module:

    Compress::Zlib

The following modules are advised for full testing, but are
not required:

    use File::Copy (normally available, since it is in the core)
    use Test::Cmd
    use Test::Pod
    use Test::Pod::Coverage

BASIC USAGE

    use Acme::DonMartin;
    print "hello, world\n";

Place the above code in a file, and then execute it, and it will
be transformed into Don Martin sound effects. Run it a second time,
and it will perform as expected. (In this case, "hello, world" will
be printed to the usual place.

BUGS

I have made an improved attempt, as of version 0.07, to create a
test suite for this module that works reliably and portably. (It
works okay on Unix and Win32). Mainly by finding the right Test
modules to do all the nitty-gritty details for me.
