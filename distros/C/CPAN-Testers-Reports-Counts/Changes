Revision history for Perl module CPAN::Testers::Reports::Counts

0.05 2015-10-27
    - Updated github repo URL after changing my github username
    - Include a META.json in releases, and tag & push to github on release

0.04 2014-02-14
    - Lazy loading of the data from CPAN Testers. The site was recently
      down, and all the test runs failed because of the require test.
    - Added a SEE ALSO section to doc.

0.03 2014-02-10
    - Stopped using LWP::Online in the tests (occasional failures from
      CPAN Testers website were causing failing tests) and instead
      wrapped up http_get():
          CPAN::Testers::Reports::Counts::TestWrapper
      If the http_get() request fails, then we provide fallback data,
      if we have some.

0.02 2014-02-01
    - Bumped min perl to 5.8.0, as use of Internals::SvREADONLY requires it
      (and submitted a pull request to Perl::MinimumVersion to fix that :-)

0.01 2014-01-29
    - Initial release to CPAN
