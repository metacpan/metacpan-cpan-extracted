NAME
    inc - Smart @INC Processing

SYNOPSIS
        use inc <smart-object-spec-list>;

    or:

        perl -Minc=<smart-object-spec-list> …

    or:

        PERL5OPT='-Minc=<smart-object-spec-list>' prove -v t/

DESCRIPTION
    The "inc" module redefines @INC to a list of predefined *smart objects*.
    These objects are really just code refs for handy lookup techniques. For
    example, only finding modules that were core in Perl 5.8.1, or only
    finding non-core modules that are declared prerequisites of some module.

    A real example is testing a module that you are releasing to CPAN. You
    can use this to make sure that only predeclared prerequisite modules get
    loaded:

        PERL5OPT='-Minc=dist.ini:core=5.8.1:lib' prove -v t/

    Each smart object object can have an argument list:

        use inc 'core=5.8.1';

    In this example "core" is the name of the smart object (code ref) and
    '5.8.1' is an argument. Multiple arguments are separated by commas.

    The list of objects can be a real list or a single string separated by
    colons. This is to allow easy usage loading "inc" using "-M":

        perl -Minc=lib:core …

SMART OBJECTS
    This is a list of the smart objects that are predefined by the "inc"
    module (in alpha order):

    "blib"
        Use the path values that "blib.pm" would add.

    "cache"
        Some of the smart objects can take long time to get their
        information. They might need to fetch information from the internet,
        for example. This object will save all the state into a file called
        "./.perl-inc-cache". You can override this filename by passing a
        value of your own as an argument.

        If the cache file exists it will be used. If not, values will be
        stored to it. To refresh the cache, simply delete the file.

    "core"
        Only finds the modules that are in core for the version of Perl that
        is running. You can give this a Perl version argument, and modules
        will be limited to the ones that were core for that version.

    "cwd"
        Adds the absolute path of the current directory.

    "deps"
        Only finds modules that are known prereqs of a module. Defaults to
        the module from which it was called. You can pass in the names of
        one or more modules to use.

    "dot"
        Adds "File::Spec->curdir". (Usually ".").

    "dzil"
        Use Dist::Zilla's "dzil listdeps" to find prereqs. Only find these
        modules.

    "inc"
        Expands to the value on @INC prior to the execution of "use inc …".

    "INC"
        Expands to the perl's default @INC.

    "LC"
        Lancaster Core. Alias for "core=5.8.1"

    "lib"
        Expands to an absolute path of "./lib".

    "meta"
        Only find modules listed as prereqs in "META.json" or "META.yaml".
        Also finds modules that are prereqs of those modules.

    "none"
        Use this to set @INC to the empty list. The "use inc …" statement
        requires at least one object, so this is needed to make it empty.

    "not=<regex>"
        Removes paths that match the regex.

    "ok=<regex>"
        If the name of the module being loaded matches the regex, it will be
        loaded from the original @INC.

    "perl5lib"
        Expands to the paths in the PERL5LIB environment variable.

    "priv"
        Adds "privlib" and "archlib" paths from the Config module.

    "-priv"
        Removes "privlib" and "archlib" paths from the Config module.

    "show"
        This is for debugging. Prints the @INC values that have been
        assembled so far.

    "site"
        Adds "sitelib" and "sitearch" paths from the Config module.

    "-site"
        Removes "sitelib" and "sitearch" paths from the Config module.

    "zild"
        Use Zilla::Dist's "zild listdeps" to find prereqs. Only find these
        modules.

    Directory Paths
        Any list value containing a '/' in the name, is a real filesystem
        path. That means you can do something like:

            use inc 'foo', @INC, 'bar';

    "::Foo" (Plugins)
        Use the "inc::Plugin::Foo" module to look for smart objects. Objects
        will be searched in plugins first, then "inc.pm".

USE WITHOUT "USE"
    If you just want to get the list of real values the "inc" would create
    from a usage list, do this:

        require inc;
        my @inc = inc->list(<smart-object-spec-list>);

    This can be used to have more control and set @INC yourself.

"INC" PLUGINS
    You can define your own "inc" plugin by making a module called
    "inc::Plugin::Mine":

        package inc::Plugin::Mine;
        sub inc_this {
          …
        }

    People can use it like this:

        use inc qw'::Mine this=arg1,arg2';

    Plugins are searched in the reverse order they are loaded in. For
    example:

        use inc qw'this ::His that ::Hers other';

    The "this" object will only be looked for in "inc". The "that" object
    will be looked for in "inc::Plugin::His" then "inc". The "that" object
    will be looked for in "inc::Plugin::Hers", then "inc::Plugin::His" then
    "inc".
