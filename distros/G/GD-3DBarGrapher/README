GD-3DBarGrapher

3DBarGrapher was written primarily to create "professional looking" 3D bar
graphs.

It features:

  - customisable colours, fonts and dimensions 
  - bar or column styles 
  - gradient fill option for columns and plot area background 
  - random bar colour feature to easily make multiple graphs on the same
    page more distinct 
  - XHTML image map output to enable displaying of values when moving mouse
    cursor over the bars
    
Example usage:

  use GD::3DBarGrapher qw(creategraph);
        
  my @data = (
      ['Apples', 28],
      ['Pears',  43],
      ...etc 
  );

  my %options = (
      'file' => '/webroot/images/mygraph.jpg',
  );

  my $imagemap = creategraph(\@data, \%options);
