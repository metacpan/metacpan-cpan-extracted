  DESCRIPTION
    This module implements most of the Magrathea NTS API
    <https://www.magrathea-telecom.co.uk/assets/Client-Downloads/Numbering-A
    PI-Instructions.pdf> in a simple format.

  EXPORT
    Nothing Exported.

  MAIN API METHODS
  Constructor
   new
    This will create a new Magrathea object and open at telnet session to
    the server. If authorisation fails, it will croak.

        my $mt = new Magrathea::API(
            username    => 'myuser',
            password    => 'mypass',
        );

   Parameters:
    username
    password
        The username and password allocated by Magrathea.

    host
        Defaults to *api.magrathea-telecom.co.uk* but could be overridden.

    port
        Defaults to *777*.

    timeout
        In seconds. Defaults to *10*.

    debug
        If set to a true value, this will output the conversation between
        the API and Magrathea's server. Be careful as this will also echo
        the username and password.

  Allocation Methods
    In all cases where $number is passed, this may be a string containing a
    number in National format (*020 1234 5678*) or in International format
    (*+44 20 1234 5678*). Spaces are ignored. Also, Phone::Number objects
    may be passed.

    When a number is returned, it will always be in the for of a
    Phone::Number object.

   allocate
    Passed a prefix, this will allocate and activate a number. You do not
    need to add the "_" characters. If a number can be found, this routine
    will return a Phone::Number object. If no match is found, this routine
    will return "undef". It will croak on any other error from Magrathea.

   activate
    Passed a number as a string or a Phone::Number, this will activate that
    number.

   deactivate
    Passed a number as a string or a Phone::Number, this deactivates the
    number.

   reactivate
    Reactivates a number that has previously been deactivated.

   list
    This should be passed a prefix and possibly a quantity (defaulting to
    10. It will return a sorted random list of available numbers matching
    the prefix. These are returned as an array (or an arrayref) of
    Phone::Number. None of the numbers is allocated by this method.

    If none are available, the method will return an empty array.

  Block Methods
   block_allocate
    This should be passed a prefix (without any "_" characters) and an
    optional block size (defaulting to 10). It will attempt to allocate and
    activate a block of numbers.

    If a block can be found, this routine should return an array or arrayref
    of Phone::Number objects. Under odd circumstances, it is possible that
    fewer than the requested quantity of numbers will be returned;

    If no range is found is found, this routine will return "undef" in
    scalar context or an empty array in list context. It will croak on any
    other error from Magrathea.

   block_info
    This should be passed a number (string or Phone::Number) to check
    whether that number is part of a block.

    If it is, the size of the block will be returned in scalar context; In
    list context, the response will be an array of all the numbers in that
    block.

    If it is not a block, this will return "undef" or an empty array.

   block_deactivate
    This should be passed the first number in a block. It will deactivate
    and return the block of numbers.

   block_reactivate
    This should be passed the first number in a block. It will reactivate
    the block and return the size of the block in scalar context or an array
    of the numbers in list context.

    If the block is not available, this method will croak.

    In testing, this method has never worked correctly.

  Service Methods
   fax2email
    Sets a number as a fax to email.

        $mt->fax2email($number, $email_address);

   voice2email
    Sets a number as a voice to email.

        $mt->voice2email($number, $email_address);

   sip
        $mt->sip($number, $host, [$username, [$inband]]);

    Passed a number and a host, will set an inbound sip link to the
    international number (minus leading +) @ the host. If username is
    defined, it will be used instead of the number. If inband is true, it
    will force inband DTMF. The default is RFC2833 DTMF.

   divert
        $mt->divert($number, $to_number);

   status
    Returns the status for a given number.

        my $status = $mt->status($number);
        my @status = $mt->status($number);

    In scalar context, returns the first (and usually only) status as a
    Magrathea::API::Status object. In list context, returns up to three
    statuses representing the three possible setups created with ORDE.

    If the number is not allocated to us and activated, this routine returns
    "undef" in scalar context and an empty list in list context.

    The Magrathea::API::Status object has the following calls:

    "$status->number"
        A Phone::Number object representing the number to which this status
        refers.

    "$status->active"
        Boolean.

    "$status->expiry"
        The date this number expires in the form "YYYY-MM-DD".

    "$status->type"
        One of sip, fax2email, voice2email, divert or unallocated.

    "$status->target"
        The target email or phone number for this number;

    "$status->entry"
        The entry number (1, 2 or 3) for this status;

    In addition, it overloads '""' to provide as tring comprising the type
    and the target, separated by a space.

  Emergency Methods
   emergency_info
    Passed a phone number, this method returns a Magrathea::API::Emergency
    object with the current 999 information.

    Optionally it can be passed a second parameter which, if it is a truthy
    value, will set the "ported" flag.

  Low Level Methods
    All the Magrathea low level calls are available. These are simply passed
    an array of strings which are joined to create the command string. They
    return the raw response on success (minus the leading 0) and die on
    failure. $@ will contain the error.

    See the Magrathea documentation
    <http://www.magrathea-telecom.co.uk/assets/Client-Downloads/Numbering-AP
    I-Instructions.pdf>.

    The functions are:

    auth
        This is called by "new" and should not be called directly.

            $mt->auth('username', 'password');

    quit
        This is called automatically upon the Magrathea::API object going
        out of scope and should not be called directly.

    allo
            $mt->allo('0201235___');

    acti
            $mt->acti('02012345678');

            $mt->deac('02012345678');

    reac
            $mt->reac('02012345678');

    stat
            $mt->stat('02012345678');

    set
            $mt->set('02012345678 1 441189999999');
            $mt->set('02012345678 1 F:fax@mydomain.com');
            $mt->set('02012345678 1 V:voicemail@mydomain.com');
            $mt->set('02012345678 1 S:username@sip.com');
            $mt->set('02012345678 1 I:username:password@iaxhost.com');

    spin
            $mt->set('02012345678 [pin]');

    feat
            $mt->feat('02012345678 D');
            $mt->feat('02012345678 J');

    orde
            $mt->orde('02012345678 1 0000');

    info
            $mt->info('02012345678 GEN Magrathea, 14 Shute End, RG40 1BJ');

    It will not usually be necessary to call these functions directly.
