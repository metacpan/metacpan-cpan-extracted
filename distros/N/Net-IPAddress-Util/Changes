Revision history for Net-IPAddress-Util

5.000   2018-09-03
        v3.x data is not "broken", just "following a different (and more commonly followed) RFC".
        Go back to v3.x being the default, but allow v4.x to be specified with an option-setting method.
        Make the output of Data::Dumper *not* break certain terminals.
        Fix a bug where dot-quad octets beginning with '0' were not being treated as octal.

4.004   2017-10-05
        Enhanced detection and logging of repairable <= v3.x data.

4.003   2017-10-05
        Fix ::Tie so that it actually does what the POD says it does.

4.002   2017-10-04
        Add "repair" functionality to upgrade v3.x data to v4.x format.

4.001   2017-09-22
        Doc fix so that the POD specifies ::ffff:0:0:0/96 to agree with the code.

4.000   2017-09-21
        Major backwards-incompatible bug fix. Was treating ::ffff:0:0/96 as SIIT
        instead of ::ffff:0:0:0/96. Was self-compatible, but RFC-wrong.

3.033   2017-08-31
        Starting to prepare for Perl 5.026

3.032   2017-08-31
        A couple of ultra-paranoid numification tweaks

3.031   2017-08-18
        Fixup whitespace and make the tests smarter

3.030   2017-08-18
        Fix Range->outer_bounds() to return a moderately-compatible object (instead of gibberish), and nudge the tests to reflect that.
        Get rid of weird dangling dependency on utf8 -- we don't use Unicode.

3.029   2017-08-17
        Additional documentation, and a re-check of POD coverage

3.028   2017-08-17
        Clean up versioning in docs & throughout

3.027   2016-04-13
        Clean up versioning in docs & throughout

3.026   2016-04-07
        Respond better to unparseable arguments
        Respond to undef() arguments early, instead of trying to parse them

3.025   2016-03-30
        Trying again to fix stringification of IPv6 addresses

3.024   2016-03-30
        Fix stringification of IPv6 addresses

3.023   2015-03-21
        Remove requirement for Perl 5.12, to see whether it'll work on vanilla 5.10

3.022   2015-03-21
        Solve some extreme edge cases that can arise due to unpacking 'U' and then packing 'C'

3.021   2015-02-18
        Wasn't properly identifying well-formed IPv6 addresses

3.020   2015-01-??
        Code beautifying for Kwalitee purposes

3.019   2015-01-10
        Code beautifying for Kwalitee purposes

3.017   2014-09-29
        Code beautifying for Kwalitee purposes

3.016   2014-09-29
        Code cleaning

3.015   2014-09-29
        Was not accepting integers bigger than 32 bits, regardless of $PROMOTE_N32 setting

3.014   2014-09-27
        Fix typo in documentation: s/to_str/as_str/smg;

        Code cleaning on something that bizarrely appeared to work as desired
        despite being written in a highly nasty way.

3.013   2014-09-27
        Fix RT #99174: IPv6 addresses with fewer than 4 digits per word handled wrong

3.000   2013-11-01
        Back to proper CPAN-friendly version numbers

1.500   2013-10-31
        Attempt to backport the 2.x speedups and fixes into a non-mop env.

1.002   2012-06-09
        Make it explicit that 5.010 is required. Start trying to make the
        time trials smarter.

1.001   2012-05-31
        Try advancing some of the deps to see if that cures the spurious
        test fails on what look like random architectures. This is unrelated
        to the previous GMP / Pari stuff, and might be BigInt version related.

1.000   2012-05-24
        Move from ISA BigInt to HASA BigInt to try to solve the GMP / Pari
        stuff once and for all.

0.12    2011-03-26
        Fix completely idiotic thinko in handling backend specification.

0.11    2011-03-26
        Try to solve weird issue with certain binary versions of GMP and Pari.

0.10    2010-04-28
        Fewer internal dependencies means fewer chances to use the wrong lib.

0.09    2010-03-27
        Try to be even more bullet-proof wrt the N32 bugs.

0.08    2010-03-25
        Add hopefully more-useful output to the diagnostic tests

0.07    2010-03-25
        Add more purely-diagnostic tests.
        Hopefully fix weird $PROMOTE_N32 and ->as_n32() bug on Windows and BSD.

0.06    2010-03-22
        Add $PROMOTE_N32 and ->as_n32().
        Hopefully fix a weird bug on *BSD systems.
        Now at 76.2% coverage.

0.05    2010-03-22
        Make compatability API test better at surviving lack of Net::IPAddress

0.04    2010-03-21
        Added more tests for compatibility API. Now at 75.9% coverage.

0.03    2010-03-21
        Added tests for compatibility API.

0.02    2010-03-21

        First version, released on an unsuspecting world.
