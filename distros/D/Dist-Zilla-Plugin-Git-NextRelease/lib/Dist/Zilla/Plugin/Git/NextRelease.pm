=head1 NAME

Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Git::NextRelease - Use time-stamp from Git instead of process start time.

=head1 VERSION

version 0.004001

=head1 SYNOPSIS

This module acts as a moderately thin wrapper to L<< C<[NextRelease]>|Dist::Zilla::Plugin::NextRelease >>
so that the time-stamps produced are generated by asking C<git> for the time-stamp of the current branch.

If you always require a specific branch for generating time-stamps, it can be specified as a parameter.

    -[NextRelease]
    +[Git::NextRelease]

Optionally:

    +branch = master

Or:

    +default_branch = master

( The latter only having impact in detached-head conditions )

This exists mostly because of my extensive use of L<< C<[Git::CommitBuild]>|Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Git::CommitBuild >>, to provide
a commit series for both releases, and builds of all changes/commits in order to push them to Travis for testing. ( Mostly,
because testing a build branch is substantially faster than testing a master that requires C<Dist::Zilla>, especially if you're
doing "Fresh install" testing like I am. )

=head1 METHODS

=head2 C<section_header>

This is the sole method of L<< C<[NextRelease]>|Dist::Zilla::Plugin::NextRelease >> that we override,
in order for it to inject the right things.

This method basically returns the date string to append to the Changes header.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 C<branch>

If set, always use the specified branch to determine time-stamp.

Default value is resolved from determining "current" branch.

=head2 C<default_branch>

If you want being on a branch to always resolve to that branch,
but you still want a useful behavior when on a detached head,
specifying this value means that on a detached head, the stated branch will be used instead.

=head1 FORMATS

C<[Git::NextRelease]> enhances and adds a few features of C<[NextRelease]>

=over 4

=item * C<%d> - A CLDR formatter of the C<branch>'s C<HEAD> timestamp. ( Original uses simply C<now> )

=item * C<%H> - The SHA1 of C<branch>'s C<HEAD>

=item * C<%h> - The SHA1 of C<branch>'s C<HEAD> shortened to 7 characters.
