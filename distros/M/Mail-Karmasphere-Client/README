NAME
    Mail::Karmasphere::Client - Client for Karmasphere Reputation Server

SYNOPSIS
            use Mail::Karmasphere::Client qw(:all);

            my $client = new Mail::Karmasphere::Client(
                            PeerAddr        => '123.45.6.7',
                            PeerPort        => 8666,
                                    );

            my $query = new Mail::Karmasphere::Query();
            $query->identity('123.45.6.7', IDT_IP4);
            $query->composite('karmasphere.email-sender');
            my $response = $client->ask($query, 6);
            print $response->as_string;

            my $id = $client->send($query);
            my $response = $client->recv($query, 12);
            my $response = $client->recv($id, 12);

            my $response = $client->query(
                    Identities      => [ ... ]
                    Composite       => 'karmasphere.email-sender',
                            );

DESCRIPTION
    The Perl Karma Client API consists of three objects: The Query, the
    Response and the Client. The user constructs a Query and passes it to a
    Client, which returns a Response.

CONSTRUCTOR
    The class method new(...) constructs a new Client object. All arguments
    are optional. The following parameters are recognised as arguments to
    new():

    PeerAddr
        The IP address or hostname to contact. See IO::Socket::INET. The
        default is 'query.karmasphere.com'.

    PeerPort
        The TCP or UDP to contact. See IO::Socket::INET. The default is
        8666.

    Proto
        Either 'udp' or 'tcp'. The default is 'udp' because it is faster.

    Principal
        An identifier used to authenticate client connections. This may be a
        login or account name. The precise details will depend on the policy
        of the query server being used.

    Credentials
        The credentials used to authenticate the principal. This may be a
        password, or a certificate. The precise details may depend on the
        policy of the query server being used.

    Debug
        Either a true value for debugging to stderr, or a custom debug
        handler. The custom handler will be called with N arguments, the
        first of which is a string 'debug context'. The custom handler may
        choose to ignore messages from certain contexts.

METHODS
    $response = $client->ask($query, $timeout)
        Returns a Mail::Karmasphere::Response to a Mail::Karmasphere::Query.
        The core of this method is equivalent to

                $client->recv($client->send($query), $timeout)

        The method retries up to 3 times, doubling the timeout each time. If
        the application requires more control over retries or backoff, it
        should use send() and recv() individually. $timeout is optional.

    $id = $client->send($query)
        Sends a Mail::Karmasphere::Query to the server, and returns the id
        of the query, which may be passed to recv().

    $response = $client->recv($id, $timeout)
        Returns a Mail::Karmasphere::Response to the query with id $id,
        assuming that the query has already been sent using send(). If no
        matching response is read before the timeout, undef is returned.

    $response = $client->query(...)
        A convenience method, equivalent to

                $client->ask(new Mail::Karmasphere::Query(...));

        See Mail::Karmasphere::Query for more details.

EXPORTS
    IDT_IP4 IDT_IP6 IDT_DOMAIN IDT_EMAIL IDT_URL
        Identity type constants.

    AUTHENTIC SMTP_CLIENT_IP SMTP_ENV_HELO SMTP_ENV_MAIL_FROM
    SMTP_ENV_RCPT_TO SMTP_HEADER_FROM_ADDRESS
        Identity tags, indicating the context of an identity to the server.

    FL_FACTS
        A flag indicating that all facts must be returned explicitly in the
        Response.

BUGS
    UDP retries are not yet implemented.
