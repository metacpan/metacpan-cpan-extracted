NAME
    Scalar::Accessors::LikeHash - access a JSON/Sereal/etc scalar string in a
    hash-like manner

SYNOPSIS
       {
          package Acme::Storable::Accessors;
      
          use Storable qw/ freeze thaw /;
      
          use Role::Tiny::With;
          with 'Scalar::Accessors::LikeHash';
      
          sub _to_hash {
             my ($ref) = @_;
             thaw($$ref);
          }
      
          sub _from_hash {
             my ($ref, $hash) = @_;
             $$ref = freeze($hash);
          }
       }
   
       my $string = File::Slurp::slurp("some-data.storable");
       my $object = Acme::Storable::Accessors->new(\$string);
   
       $object->store(some_key => 42) unless $object->exists('some_key');
       $object->fetch('some_key');
       $object->delete('some_key');

DESCRIPTION
    The idea of this is to treat a reference to a string as if it were a hash.
    You can store key-values pairs; fetch values using keys; delete keys; etc.
    This is slow and quite silly.

    This module is a role. Concrete implementations of the role need to
    provide `_from_hash` and `_to_hash` methods to serialize and deserialize a
    hashref to/from a scalarref.

    This role provides the following methods:

    `new(\$scalar)`
        Yes, this role provides a constructor. Consumers can overide it.

    `fetch($key)`
    `store($key, $value)`
    `exists($key)`
    `delete($key)`
    `clear()`
        Delete for each key.

    `keys()`
    `values()`

    These can be called as methods on a blessed scalar reference:

            my $string = "{}";
            bless \$string, "Scalar::Accessors::LikeHash::JSON";
            $string->store(foo => 42);

    Or as class methods passing the scalar reference as an extra first
    argument:

            my $string = "{}";
            Scalar::Accessors::LikeHash::JSON->store(\$string, foo => 42);
