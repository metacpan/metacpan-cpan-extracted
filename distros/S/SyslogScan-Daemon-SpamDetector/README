SYNOPSIS
     plugin SyslogScan::Daemon::SpamDetector as sd_

            ignoreip        /etc/postfix/ourip

DESCRIPTION
    SyslogScan::Daemon::SpamDetector is a plugin for SyslogScan::Daemon that
    watches log files for indications of Spam.

    To do it's job it uses additional plugins.

CONFIGURATION PARAMETERS
    The following configuration parameters are supported:

    debug
        Debugging on (1) or off (0).

    configfile
        Usually defaulted to the config file for SyslogScan::Daemon.

    idcachesize
        How big should the message id cache be? This is used by some of the
        plugins to match up what happens to a message. For example, we need
        to remember the IP address of that a message came from
        (SyslogScan::Daemon::SpamDetector::Sendmail or
        SyslogScan::Daemon::SpamDetector::Postfix) and then later decide if
        it's spam (SyslogScan::Daemon::SpamDetector::SpamAssassin). Default
        is 10,000.

    spam_command
        A shell command to run when spam is found. In the command, $ip will
        be substituted for the IP address the message came from. All of the
        other keys to the %info array (documented blow) are also available
        as substitutions.

    ham_command
        A shell command to run when a non-spam message is found.

    ignoreip
        A filename that contains a list of IP blocks (one per line) that
        should be ignored. The blocks are in the format A.B.C.D/bits

WRITING PLUGINS
    Plugins for SyslogScan::Daemon::SpamDetector will either help recognize
    spam or do something with recognized spam.

    Either way, they create or use an <%info> hash that describes an event:

    status
        What is being reported? Values are:

        spam   A spammy message has been found.

        ham    A non-spam message has been found.

        idmap  A message has come in, establish a mapping from the "id" to
               the "ip".

    id  The message id. Usually required.

    ip  The IP address. This is required unless an "idmap" established an
        "id" -> "ip" mapping previously in which case an "id" may be used
        instead.

    score
        The spam score from SpamAssassin. If not reporting SpamAssassin,
        make something else up.

    match
        What kind of match was made. Example values are: "spamassassin",
        "spamsink", "badaddrs", etc.

    host
        Hostname of the system receiving the message.

    hideid
        If you report message ids to outsiders (like, for example if you're
        using this information to block mail) then don't report the message
        id *this time* because it is sensitive information. Optional.

    SyslogScan::Daemon::SpamDetector invokes the following methods on it's
    plugins:

    @logs = get_logs()
        Inherited from SyslogScan::Daemon.

    %info = parse_logs($logfile, $regex_matched)
        When this is called, $_ will be set to the logfile line that
        matched. Please leave $_ alone so that other plugins that matched
        the same line can also use it.

        Return "()" if not providing an %info.

    preconfig($configfile)
        Inherited from SyslogScan::Daemon.

    periodic()
        Inherited from SyslogScan::Daemon.

    spam_found(%info)
        Called when spam is found. Called though Plugins::API.

    ham_found(%info)
        Called when non-spam is found. Called though Plugins::API.

    SyslogScan::Daemon::SpamDetector provides some Plugins::API callbacks:

    process_spam_match(%info)
        Calling this is the same as returning %info from "parse_logs()".

    is_ourip($ip_address)
        Is this one of our own IP addresses and thus should be ignored? A
        return of "undef" doesn't answer but a return of 0 says that the
        item is *not* our IP address.
