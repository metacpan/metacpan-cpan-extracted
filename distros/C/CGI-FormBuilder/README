NAME
    README - README for FormBuilder 3.0, please also see Changes

DESCRIPTION
    I hate form generation and validation because the majority of the
    process is tedious and mindless. In addition to being boring, there is
    too much room for simple error, which could render your application
    insecure or just plain useless.

    So I wrote FormBuilder to try and get rid rid of the stoopid parts, as
    well as take care of some tricky parts. As a result, you can build a
    complete application with something like this:

        use CGI::FormBuilder;

        # Assume we did a DBI query to get existing values
        my $dbval = $sth->fetchrow_hashref;

        # First create our form
        my $form = CGI::FormBuilder->new(
                        fields   => [qw(name email phone gender)],
                        header   => 1,
                        method   => 'POST',
                        values   => $dbval,
                        validate => {
                           email => 'EMAIL',
                           phone => '/^1?-?\d{3}-?\d{3}-?\d{4}$/',
                        },
                        required => 'ALL',
                        stylesheet => '/path/to/style.css',
                   );

        # Change gender field to have options
        $form->field(name => 'gender', options => [qw(Male Female)] );

        if ($form->submitted && $form->validate) {
            # Get form fields as hashref
            my $fields = $form->fields;

            # Do something to update your data (you would write this)
            do_data_update($fields->{name}, $fields->{email},
                           $fields->{phone}, $fields->{gender});

            # Show confirmation screen
            print $form->confirm;
        } else {
            # Print out the form
            print $form->render;
        }

    That simple bit of code would print out an entire form, laid out in a
    table. Your default database values would be filled in from the DBI
    hashref. It would also handle stickiness across multiple submissions
    correctly, and it will also be able to tell if it's been submitted.
    Finally, it will do both JavaScript and server-side validation too.

KEY FEATURES
    Here's the main stuff that I think is cool:

  Input field abstraction
    You simply define your fields and their values, and this module will
    take care of figuring out the rest. FormBuilder will automatically
    generate the appropriate input fields (input, select, radio, etc), even
    changing any JavaScript actions appropriately.

  Easy handling of defaults
    Just specify a hash of values to use as the defaults for your fields.
    This will be searched case-insensitively and displayed in the form.
    What's more, if the user enters something via the CGI that overrides a
    default, when you use the "field()" method to get the data you'll get
    the correct value.

  Correct stickiness
    Stickiness is a PITA. FormBuilder correctly handles even multiple values
    selected in a multiple select list, integrated with proper handling of
    defaults.

  Multiple submit mode support
    Related to the above, FormBuilder allows you to reliably tell whether
    the person clicked on the "Update" or "Delete" button of your form,
    normally a big pain.

  Robust field validation
    Form validation sucks, and this is where FormBuilder is a big help. It
    has tons of builtin patterns, and will even generate gobs of JavaScript
    validation code for you. You can specify your own regexps as well, and
    FormBuilder will correctly check even multivalued inputs.

  Template driver support
    FormBuilder can natively "drive" several major templating engines,
    including "HTML::Template", "Template Toolkit", and "Text::Template". if
    you want to build a form application with a template in less that 20
    lines of Perl, FormBuilder is for you.

SUPPORT
    If this is your first time using FormBuilder, you should check out the
    website for tutorials and examples at <http://formbuilder.org>.

    You should also consider joining the google group at
    <http://groups.google.com/group/perl-formbuilder>. There are some pretty
    smart people on the list that can help you out.

    Have fun!
