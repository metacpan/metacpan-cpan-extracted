NAME
    Data::Password::Manager - generate, check, manage crypt - des passwords

SYNOPSIS
      use Data::Password::Manager qw(
            pw_gen
            pw_valid
            pw_obscure
            pw_clean
            pw_get
      );

      $password = pw_gen($cleartext);
      $ok = pw_valid($cleartxt,$password);
      $clean_text = pw_clean($dirty_text);
      ($code,$text) = $pw_obscure($newpass,$oldpass,$min_len);
      $passwd = pw_get($user,$passwd_file,\$error);

DESCRIPTION
    * $password = pw_gen($cleartext);
      Generate a 13 character DES password string from clear text

        input:        string <= 128 characters
        output:       password

    * $ok = pw_valid($cleartxt,$password);
      Return true if clear text is password match

        input:        string <= 128 characters,
                      password
        output:       true on match, else false

    * $clean_text = pw_clean($dirty_text);
        Clean a text string to only include
        / . 0..9 a..z A..Z

        Useful for restricted password sets 
        i.e. http applications

        Returns a string of 128 characters or less

    * ($code,$text) = $pw_obscure($newpass,$oldpass);
      Check for a usable password. Returns ok if there is no old password.
      i.e. any new password will do.

        input:        string <= 128 characters

        return (0, 'OK') if no old password or new is good
        return ( 1, 'too short' ) if length < $MIN_LEN (default 5)
        return ( 2, 'no change' ) if old eq new
        return ( 3, 'a palindrome' ) if new is a palindrome
        return ( 4, 'case change only' ) if old =~ /$new$/i
        return ( 5, 'to similar' ) see code
        return ( 6, 'to simple' ) if not a good character mix
        return ( 7, 'rotated' ) if new is rotated version of old
        return ( 8, 'flipped' ) if new is old flipped around

    * $passwd=pw_get($user,$passwd_file,\$error);
      Check a password file for the presence of $user:$password.

        input:        $user
        return:       $password

      Returns undef on error and places a descriptive error message in the
      scalar $error. Since a valid password can be empty, the caller must
      check that the return value is defined, not just false.

      FILE is of the form:

              user1:DESpassword1
              user2:DESpassword2
              etc...
              # in-line comments are OK

EXPORTS_OK
            pw_gen
            pw_valid
            pw_clean
            pw_obscure
            pw_get
