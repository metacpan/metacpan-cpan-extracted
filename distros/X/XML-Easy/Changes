version 0.009; 2011-10-27

  * change usage of Params::Classify functions to take advantage of
    custom ops in Params::Classify 0.012

  * fix a latent bug where SvCUR() was used without first checking SvPOK()
    (but SvPOK was guaranteed by other circumstances)

  * correct dynamic_config setting to 0

  * include META.json in distribution

  * convert .cvsignore to .gitignore

  * add MYMETA.json to .gitignore

version 0.008; 2010-10-24

  * in XS, declare "PROTOTYPES: DISABLE" to prevent automatic generation
    of unintended prototypes

  * jump through hoops to avoid compiler warnings

  * in t/setup_pp.pl, avoid a warning and consequent false test failure
    that occurs if XSLoader::load() is given no arguments, which is now
    a valid usage

version 0.007; 2010-10-15

  * bugfix: avoid memory leak in construction of content objects

  * in XS, use newSVpvs(), sv_catpvs_nomg(), and gv_stashpvs() wherever
    appropriate

  * in XS, use PERL_NO_GET_CONTEXT for efficiency

  * use full stricture in test suite

  * also test POD coverage of pure Perl implementation

  * in test suite, make all numeric comparisons against $] stringify it
    first, to avoid architecture-dependent problems with floating point
    rounding giving it an unexpected numeric value

  * in Build.PL, explicitly set needs_compiler to avoid bogus
    auto-dependency on ExtUtils::CBuilder

  * list XML::Easy::SimpleSchemaUtil and
    XML::Easy::Transform::RationalizeNamespacePrefixes in documentation's
    lists of other distributions

  * in Build.PL, complete declaration of configure-time requirements

  * move declaration of $VERSION in XML::Easy::Syntax to match all
    other modules

  * slightly reformat some C code to avoid exceeding 80 columns

version 0.006; 2010-05-20

  * bugfix: in XS, check SvOBJECT before looking at SvSTASH, because
    the latter isn't guaranteed to be meaningful otherwise

  * port to Perl 5.11, supporting new first-class regexp objects in
    type checking

  * check for required Perl version at runtime

  * in XS, avoid using "class" as a variable name, for compatibility
    with C++ compilers

  * in Build.PL, explicitly declare configure-time requirements

  * remove bogus "exit 0" from Build.PL

  * in XML::Easy::NodeBasics documentation, reference
    XML::Easy::ProceduralWriter

  * add MYMETA.yml to .cvsignore

version 0.005; 2009-08-16

  * bugfix: in xml_content_object(), xml_content(), and xml_element(),
    avoid clobbering function arguments (this occurred when passing a
    content array as an argument)

  * in XML::Easy::NodeBasics, add node equality comparison functions

  * introduce the term "twine" for content
    arrays, and corresponding methods and functions
    (XML::Easy::Content->twine, XML::Easy::Element->content_twine,
    XML::Easy::Classify::is_xml_content_twine,
    XML::Easy::Text::xml10_read_{content,extparsedent}_twine,
    XML::Easy::NodeBasics::xml{,_c,_e}_content_twine)

  * in XML::Easy::Classify, add "check_" functions for argument checking

  * in XML::Easy::NodeBasics, add short names for all functions

  * tweak introductory documentation to improve comprehension

  * in documentation, note that returned twine arrays and attribute
    hashes must not be modified

  * list Test::XML::Easy in documentation's list of other distributions

version 0.004; 2009-05-20

  * bugfix: correct character classification code that was incorrectly
    rejecting characters U+ac00 to U+d7a3 (precomposed Hangul syllables)
    in XML names

  * XS implementation of low-level constructors and accessors for element
    and content nodes

  * document the XML::Easy::Transform:: namespace

  * in XS code, fix the char_unicode() function to return the documented
    sentinel value (it was returning a different value than intended,
    but one which still operated correctly)

version 0.003; 2009-05-13

  * in XS code, use the correct "PREINIT:" instead of "INIT:" to introduce
    variable declarations

  * in XS code, use the cheaper SvOBJECT() in place of truth-value uses
    of SvSTASH()

  * use simpler "parent" pragma in place of "base"

version 0.002; 2009-03-07

  * in t/syntax_main.t, shortcut test for regexp iteration limit bug on
    pre-5.10 perls, because the test is liable to overflow the stack

  * work around Module::Build bug that was causing broken
    ExtUtils::CBuilder objects that failed to compile anything

  * to check whether C compilation is available, use Module::Build's
    more robust ->have_c_compiler method, rather than just checking for
    the availability of a C builder object

  * avoid return with expression in void function (not valid in C90)

  * add casts for pointer target signedness, and other small changes to
    the C code, to avoid compiler warnings

  * in XML::Easy::Syntax documentation, note the possibility of pre-5.10
    perls overflowing the stack when executing regexps

version 0.001; 2009-03-03

  * introduce class XML::Easy::Content to encapsulate XML content

  * add friendlier node manipulation functions in XML::Easy::NodeBasics

  * bugfix: work around perl bug that was causing spurious errors in
    the pure-Perl parser and serialiser for inputs with long (>= 32 Ki)
    sequences of characters (the XS parser and serialiser were unaffected)

  * document that the long-input perl bug affects the XML::Easy::Syntax
    regular expressions in a way that can't be effectively worked around

  * bugfix: make pure Perl parser always generate its own exception,
    not a Perl exception, when processing a character reference for
    an illegal Unicode character such as U+d800, and not emit a Perl
    warning when processing a character reference for a dubious Unicode
    character such as U+1ffff (the XS parser is unaffected)

  * bugfix: make element construction and pure Perl serialiser always
    generate its own exception, not a Perl exception, when given data
    containing an illegal Unicode character such as U+d800 (the XS
    serialiser is unaffected)

  * new module XML::Easy::Classify, with data classification functions

  * move parser and serialiser into new module XML::Easy::Text, leaving
    XML::Easy itself to be just documentation of the suite

  * revise documentation and some code for consistency of terminology

  * detect and complain about use of non-string input to parser functions

  * detect and complain about use of invalid attribute name in
    $element->attribute()

  * bugfix: properly detect and complain about use of glob as encoding
    name argument to XS serialiser functions (they were being treated
    as undef on perl 5.8)

  * where a content array or attribute hash has multiple errors,
    consistently complain about the first one rather than any other

  * detect and complain about globs used in place of string arguments,
    in XS version (the pure-Perl version already detected them)

  * add #line directive to XML::Easy::Text to give useful line numbers
    in error messages regarding the code in the __DATA__ section

  * more test cases

  * don't use literal CR in t/read.data, because it was causing signature
    checking problems

  * avoid declaration-after-statement in C code (not valid in C90)

  * use full stricture in Build.PL

version 0.000; 2008-04-08

  * initial released version
