A test suite for the DtfSQLmac driver
=====================================

Most of the tests are borrowed from Jochen Wiedmann's test suite for  
DBD drivers, which is part of the Msql-Mysql-modules distribution 
found on CPAN. Credits to Jochen Wiedmann.

I've adapted that testsuite to (a) Mac OS and (b) to my needs while
testing the DtfSQLmac driver.



What's currently included?
==========================

The test suite consists of a lot of files, currently these are:

  lib.pl				Is the core of the test suite, being included in nearly
  						any test before doing anything; in short it defines
            			some global variables and also some global functions 
						used within any test.

  README.tests    		This file.

  00load.t				Tests loading of required modules and driver.
  
  01base.t	    		This is essentially the base.t from DBD::Oracle. It
						checks whether the driver may be installed.

  10dsn_driverlist.t   	This test lists all available DBI drivers, checks if 
  						the DtfSQLmac driver is found and lists all available 
						data sources for our driver.

  20connect.t   		This test connects and disconnects to the test database, 
  						checks if the connection is alive or not and checks if we 
						can connect a second time and as an unknown user.

  30createdrop.t   		Creates a table and drops it.

  40insertfetch.t  		Inserts a row into a table and retrieves it.

  50bindparam.t    		Checks the bind_col() method and the internal function 
  						dbd_ph_bind().
						
  51listfields.t   		Checks the attributes of a statement handle, currently
		   				NUM_OF_FIELDS, NAME and NULLABLE.

  52nulls.t        		Checks working with NULLS.

  53numrows.t			Tests, whether the number of rows can be retrieved.

  60chopblanks.t   		Checks the "ChopBlanks" attribute.

  61commit.t       		Checks commit, rollback and the "AutoCommit" attribute.

  90failure.t			Various (failure-) tests. Many of them *should* fail in order 
  						to stress test the internal error handling.
