Revision history for Perl extension DB2.

0.10
    * Original version: a massive rewrite from the three or four
      previous frameworks, first time prepared for possible
      redistribution

0.11
    ! Added significant (read: non-trivial) test cases.  Found problems
      while doing so.  Reorganised some code.

0.12
    + Added SELECT_join, find_join to DB2::Table
    + Added case insensitive match for DB2::db::get_table

0.13
    ! API CHANGE
    - Obsoleted get_row_table_relationship
    + Add add_row_table_relationship (to add more flexibility,
      and save me some significant typing)

0.14
    + Added !!!/!<tbl>! support to CONSTRAINT and FOREIGNKEY
      column attributes
    + Improved return codes from DB2::Row->save() - should be able
      to reliably use "true" as success.  Note that if nothing has
      changed, it is considered "true" that it saved okay.
    + Add default ROW setting for setup_row_table_relationship
      Defaults to C<$tablename . "R"> .
    + Added add_table as a simpler way to call
      add_row_table_relationship (especially when using the new
      default)

0.15
    + Added default row type - now you don't need to derive a type
      from DB2::Row if you have nothing to overload.  Deriving from
      DB2::Table remains since you always have to overload data_order.
    + Added add_tables as a simpler way to call add_table, only if
      using the defaults.
    + Added set_default_package for adding tables in other packages.

0.16
    + Added get_base_row_type (was base_row_type in 0.15, but not
      documented).
    * Submitted to CPAN for the first time

0.17
    + Added LICENSE file.  Woops.

0.18
    + Reworked SELECT to be a more general function.
      + Added ability to pass in columns as array ref
      + Added ability to pass in extra options
        + Added FOR READ ONLY clause, made it the default for find*
          functions
      - Obsoleted SELECT_join and SELECT_distinct as they can both
        be done via SELECT (simultaneously, even!)
      + Added statement attributes
    + Slight speed-up to DB2::db::get_row_type_for_table by converting
      eval STR to eval BLOCK.
    + Added DB2::Row::as_hash for *::Template users

0.19
    + Allowed table types to be pre-loaded - if you don't want to put
      the table package into its own module, you'll need to use/require
      it first, and then DB2::db::get_table will just use it.
    + Setting $DB2::db::debug to greater than 1 will now Carp::cluck
      the SQL statement about to be prepared so you can see the context
      of any DBD::DB2 error messages.

0.20
    + Added table delete functions - delete_id, delete_where, allowing
      for massive cleanups without having to retrieve the data first.

0.21
    ! Changed to Module::Build
    ! API CHANGE
      * All data_order tags were lowercased.  This is partly to follow
        Perl conventions, and partly to follow XML conventions.
        (Hoping to eventually add a DB2::TableFromXML or something)
    + Added pod-coverage tests (CPANTS game)

0.22
    ! Forgot to add Test::NoWarnings as requirement
    ! Added call to finish statement handle for generated identities
    + Added WITH statement support (though if you start using this,
      you're probably more advanced than the author of this framework,
      and may be better off just using DBI directly)

0.23
    ! DB2::Row::as_hash wasn't returning hashes properly
    ! DB2::db::create_db had a similar bug in precedence
    ! get_column was lc'ing something that wasn't always passed in - woops

0.24
    + Add DB2::db::dsn, allowing override to connect to remote databases
      that are not currently cataloged locally

0.25
    + Add sqldefault
    ! Fix dsn - it seemed to break local connections?
