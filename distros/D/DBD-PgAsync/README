DBD::PgAsync
------------

This is a fork of DBD::Pg (3.18.0) intended to fully support
asynchronous database operations. In addition to the existing DBD::Pg
async support, this needs

	1. Support for async connect via PQconnectStart/ PQconnectPoll.
        2. Support for async prepare PQsendPrepare.
        3. Removal of synchronous database operations embedded in
           dbdimp.c functions, eg, in pg_db_cancel.

1) is implemented using a special attribute to connect and a method
named pg_continue_connect which functions as interface to
PQconnectPoll. See manpage for more details.

2) is implemented as well. The code should transparently use
PQsendPrepare instead of PQprepare for async statements.

3) completed so far:

	- pg_cancel no longer waits for the result of the cancelled
          query.

	- transactions started automatically when autocommit is off
          use asychronous command execution          

Bug reports etc specifically about this code should probably rather be
sent to me than to any other DBD::Pg address, especially including the
principal author of most of the code (<greg@turnstep.com>).

Present status
--------------

WIP to get this cleaned up for CPAN release. AFAICT, the code for this
is complete and working but it still fails some of the automated
style tests.


Debian Package
--------------

Because development happens on Debian (Devuan, actually, but that's an
unimportant detail), there's support for creating a Debian package of
the driver. This has only been tested Devuan daedalus (Debian 12
based) and the only tested way to build the package is executing

fakeroot debian/rules binary

in the top-level distribution directory.
