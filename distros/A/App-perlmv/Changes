        - Support searching for scriptlet in App::perlmv::scriptlet::* modules.
          In this way, scriptlet code is written as normal Perl code instead of
          inside a string, so it can get checked when loaded. You can also add
          summary/description/tags etc.

        - Add tab completion support.


0.50    2015-11-17  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	  [CT].


0.47     2014-05-15  Released-By: PERLANCAR

         - [Bugfix] Use l_abs_path() instead of abs_path() so we can handle
           symlinks to non-existing targets. Also, use File::Spec->rel2abs()
           instead of abs_path() to absolutize new/renamed file, because new
           path might not exist (yet). [RT#101288]


0.46     2014-05-15  Released-By: SHARYANTO

         - No functional changes.

         - Replace given/when in test suite to if/else, because it becomes

           devices. The new script 'perlrename' is added; this one still uses
           Perl's rename().

           la piping.

           now --execute.
