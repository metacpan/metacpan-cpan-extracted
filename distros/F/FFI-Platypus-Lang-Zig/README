NAME

    FFI::Platypus::Lang::Zig - Documentation and tools for using Platypus
    with the Zig programming language

VERSION

    version 0.02

SYNOPSIS

    Zig:

     pub export fn add(a: i32, b: i32) i32 {
         return a + b;
     }

    Perl:

     use FFI::Platypus 2.00;
     use FFI::CheckLib qw( find_lib_or_die );
     use File::Basename qw( dirname );
     
     my $ffi = FFI::Platypus->new( api => 2, lang => 'Zig' );
     $ffi->lib(
       find_lib_or_die(
         lib        => 'add',
         libpath    => [dirname __FILE__],
         systempath => [],
       )
     );
     
     $ffi->attach( add => ['i32','i32'] => 'i32' );
     
     print add(1,2), "\n";  # prints 3

DESCRIPTION

    This module provides native Zig types for FFI::Platypus in order to
    reduce cognitive load and concentrate on Zig and forget about C types.
    This document also covers using Platypus with Zig, and includes a
    number of examples.

    Note that in addition to using pre-compiled Zig libraries, you can
    bundle Zig code with your Perl distribution using FFI::Build and
    FFI::Build::File::Zig.

EXAMPLES

    The examples in this discussion are bundled with this distribution and
    can be found in the examples directory.

 Passing and Returning Integers

  Zig Source

     pub export fn add(a: i32, b: i32) i32 {
         return a + b;
     }

  Perl Source

     use FFI::Platypus 2.00;
     use FFI::CheckLib qw( find_lib_or_die );
     use File::Basename qw( dirname );
     
     my $ffi = FFI::Platypus->new( api => 2, lang => 'Zig' );
     $ffi->lib(
       find_lib_or_die(
         lib        => 'add',
         libpath    => [dirname __FILE__],
         systempath => [],
       )
     );
     
     $ffi->attach( add => ['i32','i32'] => 'i32' );
     
     print add(1,2), "\n";  # prints 3

  Execute

     $ zig build-lib -dynamic add.zig
     $ perl add.pl
     3

  Notes

    Basic types like integers and floating points are the easiest to pass
    across the FFI boundary. The Platypus Zig language plugin (this module)
    provides the basic types used by Zig (for example: bool, i32, u64, f64,
    isize and others) will all work as a Zig programmer would expect. This
    is nice because you don't have to think about what the equivalent types
    would be in C when you are writing your Perl extension in Zig.

    Zig functions do not use the same ABI as C by default, so if you want
    to be able to call Zig functions from Perl they need to be declared
    with the C calling convention callconv(.C) as in this example.

METHODS

    Generally you will not use this class directly, instead interacting
    with the FFI::Platypus instance. However, the public methods used by
    Platypus are documented here.

 native_type_map

     my $hashref = FFI::Platypus::Lang::Zig->native_type_map;

    This returns a hash reference containing the native aliases for the Zig
    programming languages. That is the keys are native Zig types and the
    values are libffi native types.

CAVEATS

    Only one example so far! Hopefully more to come soon.
