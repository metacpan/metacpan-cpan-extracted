NAME
    HTTP::Request::Params - Retrieve GET/POST Parameters from HTTP Requests

SYNOPSIS
      use HTTP::Request::Params;
  
      my $http_request = read_request();
      my $parse_params = HTTP::Request::Params->new({
                           req => $http_request,
                         });
      my $params       = $parse_params->params;

DESCRIPTION
    This software does all the dirty work of parsing HTTP Requests to find
    incoming query parameters.

  new
      my $parser = HTTP::Request::Params->new({
                      req => $http_request,
                   });

    "req" - This required argument is either an "HTTP::Request" object or a
    string containing an entire HTTP Request.

    Incoming query parameters come from two places. The first place is the
    "query" portion of the URL. Second is the content portion of an HTTP
    request as is the case when parsing a POST request, for example.

  params
      my $params = $parser->params;

    Returns a hash reference containing all the parameters. The keys in this
    hash are the names of the parameters. Values are the values associated
    with those parameters in the incoming query. For parameters with
    multiple values, the value in this hash will be a list reference. This
    is the same behaviour as the "CGI" module's "Vars()" function.

  req
      my $req_object = $parser->req;

    Returns the "HTTP::Request" object.

  mime
      my $mime_object = $parser->mime;

    Returns the "Email::MIME" object.

    Now, you may be wondering why we're dealing with an "Email::MIME"
    object. The answer is simple. It's an amazing parser for MIME compliant
    messages, and RFC 822 compliant messages. When parsing incoming POST
    data, especially file uploads, "Email::MIME" is the perfect fit. It's
    fast and light.
