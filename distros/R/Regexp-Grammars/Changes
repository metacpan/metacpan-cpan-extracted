    * Fixed mishandling of (??{....}) blocks

    * Documented more explicitly that start-pattern is supposed to act
      like a regular regex (or a token) wrt to whitespace



1.011  Sun Oct 10 18:57:10 2010

    * Added <!RULENAME> as alias for: (?! <.RULENAME> )

      that errors manifest in @! variable (thanks Leigh)

      to optimize error messages (thanks Nicolas)

    * Removed undocumented dependency of test suite on Class::Accessor
      (thanks Duff)

    * Tweaked caveats section to reflect improvements both in module

    * Made Latin-1 encoding of docs explicit


1.022  Tue Jan 22 18:39:16 2013

    * Doc patch (thanks Steven)

    * Added workarounds for some unfortunate changes in 5.18 behaviour
      (thanks Steven)

    * CRITICAL: Added warning regarding fundamental and intractable
      incompatibilities with Perl 5.18, and announcing that
      Regexp::Grammars is not supported under that version of Perl. :-(


1.030  Wed Jun 26 07:17:41 2013

    * Added essential-but-missing Skip_if_Perl_518 to the MANIFEST



1.031  Mon Aug 19 09:55:37 2013

    * Updated warning re 5.18 incompatibilities. Some progress has been
      made, but a complete solution is still at least a month away,
      possibly longer.

    * Added dependency on Lexical::Var under Perl 5.18 to overcome
      problem with magic pseudo-variables


1.032  Thu Aug 29 10:44:21 2013

    * Culled stray DB::single = 1 (thanks Robert!)


1.033  Sat Aug 31 13:10:57 2013

    * Listed dependency on Lexical::Var under Perl 5.18 to overcome
      problem with magic pseudo-variables (thanks Andreas!)

      (thanks Olivier)

    * Fixed last bug preventing module from passing
      its own test suite under 5.20.

    * Gave up (for the present) on Perl 5.18 compatibility.

    * Noted limitations of passing %MATCH values as subrule args
      under 5.18+


1.035  Sat Jun 28 19:03:54 2014

    (All of the following with deepest thanks to Hugo...)

    * Removed no-longer-necessar Skip_if_Perl_518.pm from MANIFEST

    * Allowed rule declarations to be made anywhere
      (not just at the start of a line)

    * Fixed buggy edge-case for in-rule whitespace auto-matching
      at start of rule body (now works even if there is only a single
      whitespace between <rule: NAME> and first element of rule body)

    * Made R::G auto-/x any regex used under its suasion
      (solves formerly intractable problem of detecting a missing /x)

    * R::G now short-circuits any regex in its scope that does not
      contain any R::G constructs (and does not auto-/x them either)

    * Added line numbers to all warnings generated by the module

    * Added detection of "stray" quantifiers: unquoted quantifiers that
      don't actually quantify anything.

    * Added line-number annotations to the transformed regex as a
      last-gasp kind of assistance when confronted with the dreaded
      post-transformation "error marked with <-- HERE" message



1.036  Mon Sep 15 12:58:47 2014

    * Minor doc improvements

    * Fixed odd behaviour of <debug: off> 
      (Thanks, Chris!)



1.038  Thu Dec 11 14:52:05 2014

    * Fixed bug where actions persisted after a failed ->with_actions() match
      (Thanks Hao Wu!)




1.039  Sat Feb  7 08:39:58 2015

    * Module works correctly under 5.18.4.
      Updated warnings to reflect this.
      (Thanks p5p!)


1.040  Thu Mar 26 07:44:41 2015

    * Tweaked Makefile.PL and BUILD.PL to (maybe)
      work more happily with the CPANTesters toolchain



1.041  Sun May  3 12:57:37 2015

    * Documented edge case where new 5.18 regex compilation semantics
      breaks the <%hash> construct, listing two work-arounds
      (thanks David and Gianni!)

    * Fixed subtle problem with implicit whitespace-matching invalidating
      subrule argument lists
      (thanks Alex!)


1.042  Wed Sep 16 16:32:23 2015

    * Prelimary attempt to support raw named captures as well as R::G syntax
      (may induce bugs, though none found in the test suite)

    * Fixed bug deep inside demo/demo_rfc5322.pl
      (Thanks, Dale!)

    * Replaced Lexical::Vars with B::Hooks::Parser for 5.22+ compatibility
      (Thanks Alex!)


1.043  Mon Dec 14 13:14:25 2015

    * Eliminated redundant calls to setup() and teardown() for B::Hooks::Parser

    * Removed timeout test, as it cannot be reliably run across platforms
      much faster or slower than the author's development platform.
      (Thanls Slavin)


1.044  Wed Dec 16 08:22:01 2015

    * Yet another attempt to code around the changes in vars-inside-regexes
      to preserve post-5.18 compatibility (Thanks, Kent!)



1.045  Tue Jan 12 15:55:21 2016

    * Fixed bug causing premature clearing of action handlers
      (thanks Keith!)



1.047  Tue Sep 26 15:41:13 2017

    * Fixed misleading (mis-)documentation of <[MATCH=item]>
      (thanks, Felix!)

    * Fixed handling of (?>...) construct
      (thanks, Hugo!)




1.048  Wed Sep 27 06:20:49 2017

    * Hid use of Regexp package from CPAN
      (Thanks, Neil)


1.049  Fri Oct  5 06:55:49 2018

    * Modified documentation of problems with "non-backtracking"
      constructs, to cover new cases that have been discovered.
      (Sorry, Hugo)

    * Extended documentation of rules vs tokens with a short
      example demonstrating the explicit equivalence
      (thanks, Stefan)

    * Miscellaneous POD fixes (thanks, Hugo)

    * Clarified behaviour of <[MATCH=subrule]>* on zero match
      (Thanks, Alex)

    * Added %% operator for separated lists
      with optional trailing separator


1.050  Sat Apr 27 08:38:21 2019

    * Improved detection of explicit space matching in rules
      (now handles \h and \v as well as \s)

    * Improved transparency of debugger so that it no longer injects
      spurious whitespace matching after debugged constructs
      (Thanks, Louis!)



1.051  Tue Jul  2 20:17:55 2019

    * Documented %% operator

    * Numerous POD nits fixed (thanks, Ruud and Alex!)
