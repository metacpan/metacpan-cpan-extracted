Revision history for Net-IRC3

0.6	Tue Sep 23 12:42:11 CEST 2008
        - deprecated this module, use AnyEvent::IRC in future!
        - connect is done non blocking
        - major semantic change: you can't reuse a connection object,
          after the 'disconnect' event has been issued you have to recreate
          it and reconnect the new object. All event handlers are cleared
          after the 'disconnect' event has been issued too.
        - major api change for channel_add and channel_remove
        - added CTCP support
        - implemented automatic pinging (on user request)
