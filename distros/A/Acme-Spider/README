NAME
    Acme::Spider - frighten some other modules

SYNOPSIS
      use Acme::Spider;

DESCRIPTION
    Damian Conway is afraid of spiders, and all his code is afraid of this
    spider.

TODO
    As the spider evolves, it will become better at recognising Damian's
    modules.  It's a pity evolution doesn't happen without some help.
