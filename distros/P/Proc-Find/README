NAME
    Proc::Find - Find processes by name, PID, or some other attributes

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.051 of Proc::Find (from Perl
    distribution Proc-Find), released on 2019-11-23.

SYNOPSIS
     use Proc::Find qw(find_proc proc_exists);

     # list all of a user's processes
     my $procs = find_proc(user=>'ujang', detail=>1);

     # check if a program is running
     die "Sorry, xscreensaver is not running"
         unless proc_exists(name=>'xscreensaver').

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides a simple routine, "proc_exists()", to check a
    process' existence by name, something that is commonly done in shell
    scripts using:

     ps ax | grep name
     pgrep name

    and also some routines, "find_*()", to list processes matching some
    criteria.

VARIABLES
  $Proc::Find::CACHE => bool (default: 0)
    If set to true, will cache the call to "Proc::ProcessTable"'s "table()"
    so subsequent invocation to "find_proc()" or "proc_exists" doesn't have
    to call the method again. But this also means that the process
    check/listing will be done on a past/stale process table.

FUNCTIONS
  find_proc(%args) => \@pids (or \@procs)
    Find process by name, PID, or some other attributes. Return an arrayref
    of PID's, or an empty arrayref if none match the criteria.

    Currently use Proc::ProcessTable to list the processes.

    Arguments:

    *   filter => code

        Filter by a coderef. The coderef will receive the process record
        (hashref).

    *   pid => int|array[int]|regex

        Find by PID. Note that if you only want to check whether a PID
        exists, there are cheaper methods (see "SEE ALSO").

    *   name => str|array[str]|regex

        Match against process' "name". Name is taken from the first word of
        the cmndline, with path stripped.

        If value is regex, will do a regex match instead of exact string
        comparison.

        Example:

         find_proc(name => "bash")
         find_proc(name => qr/^(Thunar|dolphin|konqueror)$/)

    *   cmndline => str|array[str]|regex

        Match against full cmndline.

        If value is regex, will do a regex match instead of exact string
        comparison.

    *   exec => str|array[str]|regex

        Match against program (executable/binary)'s path. If value does not
        contain a path separator character, will be matched against
        program's name.

        Example:

         find_proc(exec => "perl")          # find any perl
         find_proc(exec => "/usr/bin/perl") # find only a specific perl

    *   user => int|str|array[int|str]|regex

        List processes owned by specified user/UID.

        If given a username which does not exist, will simply not match.

    *   uid => int|str|array[int|str]|regex

        Same as "user".

    *   euser => int|str|array[int|str]|regex

        List processes running as certain effective user/UID (will look
        against "euid").

        If given a username which does not exist, will simply not match.

    *   euid => int|str|array[int|str]|regex

        Same as "euser".

    *   inverse => bool

        If set to true, then will return all processes *not* matching the
        criteria.

    *   table => obj

        Supply result from "Proc::ProcessTable" object's "table()". This can
        be used to reuse the "table()" cached result instead of repeatedly
        call "table()" on every invocation.

        See also $Proc::Find::CACHE.

    *   detail => bool (default: 0)

        Instead of returning just the PID for each result, return a hash
        (record) of process information instead. Currently this is just the
        entry from "Proc::ProcTable" object's "table()" result.

  proc_exists(%args) => bool
    Shortcut for:

     @{ find_proc(%args) } > 0

  find_all_proc(\%args, \%args2, ...) => \@pids (or \@procs)
    Given multiple criteria, perform an AND search. Will only call
    "Proc::ProcessTable"'s "table()" method once.

     # find all processes matching mutiple criteria (although the same thing can
     # also be accomplished by find_proc() and combining the criteria)
     find_all_proc([{name=>'mplayer'}, {cmndline=>qr/mp3/}]);

  find_any_proc(\%args, \%args2, ...) => \@pids (or \@procs)
    Given multiple criteria, perform an OR search. Will only call
    "Proc::ProcessTable"'s "table()" method once.

     # find all processes belonging to either user
     find_any_proc([{user=>'ujang'}, {user=>'titin'}]);

BUGS
    Please report any bugs or feature requests on the bugtracker website
    <https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Dist/Display.html?Name=Proc-Find>

    When submitting a bug or request, please include a test-file or a patch
    to an existing test-file that illustrates the bug or desired feature.

SEE ALSO
    Proc::Exists can be used to check if one or more PIDs exist. If you are
    only concerned with POSIX systems, you can just do "kill 0, $pid" to
    accomplish the same.

    pgrep Unix command.
