SYNOPSIS

     use Text::WideChar::Util qw(
         mbpad pad mbswidth mbswidth_height mbtrunc trunc mbwrap wrap);
    
     # get width as well as number of lines
     say mbswidth_height("red\n红色"); # => [4, 2]
    
     # wrap text to a certain column width
     say mbwrap("....", 40);
    
     # pad (left, right, center) text to specified column width, handle multilines
     say mbpad("foo", 10);                          # => "foo       "
     say mbpad("红色", 10, "left");                 # => "      红色"
     say mbpad("foo\nbarbaz\n", 10, "center", "."); # => "...foo....\n..barbaz..\n"
    
     # truncate text to a certain column width
     say mbtrunc("红色",  2); # => "红"
     say mbtrunc("红色",  3); # => "红"
     say mbtrunc("红red", 3); # => "红r"

DESCRIPTION

    This module provides routines for dealing with text containing wide
    characters (wide meaning occupying more than 1 column width in
    terminal).

FUNCTIONS

 mbswidth($text) => INT

    Like Text::CharWidth's mbswidth(), except implemented using
    Unicode::GCString->new($text)->columns.

 mbswidth_height($text) => [INT, INT]

    Like mbswidth(), but also gives height (number of lines). For example,
    mbswidth_height("foobar\nb\n") gives [6, 3].

 length_height($text) => [INT, INT]

    This is the non-wide version of mbswidth_height() and can be used if
    your text only contains printable ASCII characters and newlines.

 mbwrap($text, $width, \%opts) => STR

    Wrap $text to $width columns. It uses mbswidth() instead of Perl's
    length() which works on a per-character basis. Has some support for
    wrapping Kanji/CJK (Chinese/Japanese/Korean) text which do not have
    whitespace between words.

    Options:

      * tab_width => INT (default: 8)

      Set tab width.

      Note that tab will only have effect on the indent. Tab between text
      will be replaced with a single space.

      * flindent => STR

      First line indent. If unspecified, will be deduced from the first
      line of text.

      * slindent => STD

      Subsequent line indent. If unspecified, will be deduced from the
      second line of text, or if unavailable, will default to empty string
      ("").

      * return_stats => BOOL (default: 0)

      If set to true, then instead of returning the wrapped string,
      function will return [$wrapped, $stats] where $stats is a hash
      containing some information like max_word_width, min_word_width.

    Performance: ~450/s on my Core i5 1.7GHz laptop for a 1KB of text.

 wrap($text, $width, \%opts) => STR

    Like mbwrap(), but uses character-based length() instead of column
    width-wise mbswidth(). Provided as an alternative to the venerable
    Text::Wrap's wrap() but with a different behaviour. This module's
    wrap() can reflow newline and its behavior is more akin to Emacs (try
    reflowing a paragraph in Emacs using M-q).

    Performance: ~2000/s on my Core i5 1.7GHz laptop for a ~1KB of text.
    Text::Wrap::wrap() on the other hand is ~2500/s.

 mbpad($text, $width[, $which[, $padchar[, $truncate]]]) => STR

    Return $text padded with $padchar to $width columns. $which is either
    "r" or "right" for padding on the right (the default if not specified),
    "l" or "left" for padding on the right, or "c" or "center" or "centre"
    for left+right padding to center the text.

    $padchar is whitespace if not specified. It should be string having the
    width of 1 column.

 pad($text, $width[, $which[, $padchar[, $truncate]]]) => STR

    The non-wide version of mbpad(), just like in mbwrap() vs wrap().

 mbtrunc($text, $width) => STR

    Truncate $text to $width columns. It uses mbswidth() instead of Perl's
    length(), so it can handle wide characters.

    Does *not* handle multiple lines.

 trunc($text, $width) => STR

    The non-wide version of mbtrunc(), just like in mbwrap() vs wrap().
    This is actually not much more than Perl's substr($text, 0, $width).

INTERNAL NOTES

    Should we wrap at hyphens? Probably not. Both Emacs as well as
    Text::Wrap do not.

SEE ALSO

    Unicode::GCString which is consulted for visual width of characters.
    Text::CharWidth is about 2.5x faster but it gives weird results (-1 for
    characters like "\n" and "\t") and my Strawberry Perl installation
    fails to build it.

    Text::ANSI::Util which can also handle text containing wide characters
    as well ANSI escape codes.

    Text::WrapI18N which provides an alternative to wrap()/mbwrap() with
    comparable speed, though wrapping result might differ slightly. And the
    module currently uses Text::CharWidth.

POD ERRORS

    Hey! The above document had some coding errors, which are explained
    below:

    Around line 7:

      Non-ASCII character seen before =encoding in
      'mbswidth_height("red\n红色");'. Assuming UTF-8
