NAME
    DJSON - Decommisioned. Use JSONY.pm instead.

SYNOPSIS
        use DJSON;

        my $data = decode_djson $djson_string;

DESCRIPTION
    DJSON is a data language that is simlar to JSON, just more chill. All
    valid JSON is also valid DJSON (and represents the same thing when
    decoded), but DJSON lets you omit a lot of the syntax that makes JSON a
    pain to write.

DJSON SYNTAX
    Here is some examples of DJSON followed by equivalent JSON:

    Words don't need quotes. A list of things is an array:

        foo bar baz

        [ "foo", "bar", "baz" ]

    Strings with spaces can use single or double quotes:

        'foo bar'      # <= This is (a comment indicating) a string
        # More commenting
        "baz  boom "

        [ "foo bar ", "baz  boom " ]

    Hashes still need curly braces:

        {
            foo { bar baz }
            num -1.2e3
        }

        { "foo": { "bar": "baz" }, "num": -1.2e3 }

    More soon...

    NOTE: You may want to look at the tests (especially "t/decode.t") to see
    the full abilities of DJSON.

STATUS
    BEWARE!!!

    DJSON is mst's idea, and ingy's Pegex based implementation. The language
    is just a baby, and will change a lot, or may go away entirely.

    Development people are currently working on this in "#pegex" in
    irc.freenode.net. Please drop by.
