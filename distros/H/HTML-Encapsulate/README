NAME
    HTML::Encapsulate - rewrites an HTML page as a self-contained set of
    files

VERSION
    This document describes HTML::Encapsulate version 0.1

SYNOPSIS
        use HTML::Encapsulate qw(download);
    
        # This will download the page at the URL given in the first
        # argument into a folder named in the second, here called
        # C<bar.html>.  The folder will contain all the images and other
        # components required to view the page.  The page itself will be
        # saved as C<index.html>
        download "http://foo.com/bar" => "bar.html";

        # It also has an OO interface, allows various defaults to be
        # adjusted via the %options hash.
        my $he = HTML::Encapsulate->new(%options);
        $he->download("http://foo.com/bar" => "bar.html");


        # HTTP::Requests can also be passed.  This enables the result of
        # form posts to be captured.
        my $request = HTTP::Request->new(GET => 'http://somewhere.com/something.html');
        my $download_dir = 'some/directory/path';

        $he->download($request, $download_dir);

DESCRIPTION
    The main motivation for this module is for archiving and printing web
    pages: these typically come in various separate pieces and aren't simple
    to download as one chunk.

    However, it is possible to preserve the content of a web page, but to
    rewrite the links to the embedded contend like images, stylesheets, etc.
    so that the downloaded version can be viewed entirely offline.

    Once web pages have been downloaded in an "encapsulated" form, they can
    then be archived, and/or converted into other formats.

    The "wget" command line utility has an option for downloading web pages
    with their images and stylesheets, rewriting the links to point to the
    downloaded copies, like this:

        wget -kp http://foo.com/bar

    This command isn't always convenient, nor available, so it's a fairly
    non-portable option. This module aims to perform the same function in a
    portable, pure-perl fashion.

    See the documentation for the "->download" method for more details.

EXPORTABLE FUNCTIONS
  "download($url_or_request, $download_dir)"
  "download($url_or_request, $download_dir, $user_agent)"
    Essentially constructs a default instance and delegates to its
    "->download" method. See the appropriate documentation for that method.
    Note that, once created, this instance will be re-used by future calls
    to "download".

    Optionally, a LWP::UserAgent instance $user_agent may be supplied for
    use, e.g. if the download needs to be performed as part of an ongoing
    session, or needs to have specific properties or behaviour.

    If no $user_agent is supplied, a new LWP::UserAgent instance will be
    created by the default instance used. See the "->new" method for
    details.

CLASS METHODS
  "$obj = $class->new(%options)"
    Constructs a new instance with tweaked properties.

    Only one option is currently available:

    "ua"
        Supplies a "LWP::UserAgent" instance to use instead of the default.
        If not supplied, a default new instance will be constructed like
        this:

            $ua = LWP::UserAgent->new(
                requests_redirectable => [qw(GET POST HEAD)]
            );

        This means that redirects will be followed for "GET", "HEAD", and
        (unlike a default instance), "POST".

        One reason for using an externally supplied user agent might be to
        download within the context of a session it has created.

OBJECT METHODS
  "$obj->download($url_or_request, $download_dir)"
    This downloads the page obtained by the HTTP::Request $request (which
    could be a post, or any other request returning HTML) in the directory
    $download_dir, plus all images and other dependencies needed to render
    it.

    The main HTML document will be saved in $download_dir as 'index.html'.
    Other dependencies will be saved with filenames composed of an index
    number (1 for the first item saved, 2 for the second, etc.), plus an
    extension (taken from the source URL).

    By design, this function will dowload but not attempt to process
    non-html content (i.e. if the 'content-type' header does not end in
    html). Note also that I've been lazy, so it will still save the content
    with as "index.html" as for a HTML page.

    The content of the HTML is re-written so that links to dependencies
    refer to the downloaded files. External dependencies (anything not
    downloaded) are left as-is.

    The following dependencies *are* handled:

    *   "<img href="...">" linked images

    *   "<style href="...">" stylesheet links

    *   CSS "@import url(...)" linked stylesheets

    *   "<script src="...">" linked scripts.

    *   "<input src="...">" linked images.

    *   CSS "url()" links.

    TODO

    The following constructs are not handled, but ought to be:

    *   Frames and "iframe" tags.

    *   "<embed>", "object"

    Unsupported

    These are not handled, and may or may not get implemented:

    *   inline "data://" urls

    *   excessivly funky javascript which constructs content dynamically

DEPENDENCIES
    Dependencies are intentionally kept fairly minimal, but do exist. The
    main non-core ones are HTML::Tidy, HTML::Entities and
    HTML::TreeBuilder::XPath. See the "META.yaml" included the distribution
    for full details.

BUGS / CAVEATS
    The internals are a bit of an ugly hack. If I could find something off
    the shelf which does the job equivalently, I'd have used that. Since I
    couldn't find anything suitable I whipped this up in a jiffy, and then
    warped it to support as much as I could.

    See the description of "->download" for details of what is and isn't
    implemented.
