NAME
    RT-Extension-NonWatcherRecipients - Note when non-watchers received an
    email which RT redistributed to watchers

RT VERSION
    Works with RT 4.0, 4.2, 4.4, 5.0, 6.0

DESCRIPTION
    Sometimes email addresses will be added to a thread attached to an RT
    ticket because someone wants someone else to know what's going on.
    However, if that person isn't added as a Watcher on the RT ticket,
    they'll likely miss subsequent correspondence on the thread as RT
    doesn't know about them.

    RT::Extension::NonWatcherRecipients looks for email addresses on
    correspondence that RT doesn't know about and posts a message like this
    so you know someone may need to be added:

        ------------------------------------------------------------------------
           From: "A User" <a-user@example.com>

        The following people received a copy of this email but are not on the ticket.
        You may want to add them before replying:
        https://YourRT.com/Ticket/ModifyPeople.html?id=12345

           Cc: "Non Watcher" <non-watcher@example.com>
        ------------------------------------------------------------------------

    If you want the person to see correspondence, you can click the link and
    add them. If not, you can just ignore the message.

    You can choose between a text message or html formatted message.

INSTALLATION
    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make install
        May need root permissions

    make initdb
        Only run this the first time you install this module.

        If you run this twice, you may end up with duplicate data in your
        database.

        If you are upgrading this module, check for upgrading instructions
        in case changes need to be made to your database.

    Edit your /opt/rt6/etc/RT_SiteConfig.pm
        If you are using RT 4.2 or greater, add this line:

            Plugin('RT::Extension::NonWatcherRecipients');

        For RT 4.0, add this line:

            Set(@Plugins, qw(RT::Extension::NonWatcherRecipients));

        or add RT::Extension::NonWatcherRecipients to your existing @Plugins
        line.

    Restart your webserver

USAGE
    If you run the make initdb step, two new global templates called
    NonWatcherRecipients Admin Correspondence and NonWatcherRecipients Admin
    Correspondence in HTML are installed on your system. You can then select
    one of these templates for any scrips that use the standard Admin
    Correspondence or Admin Correspondence in HTML templates. We recommend
    the Admin Correspondence templates because you'll need RT privileges to
    add the user to the ticket.

    You can also add these to existing templates by adding the following to
    any template for the plain text version:

        { RT::Extension::NonWatcherRecipients->FindRecipients(
            Transaction => $Transaction, Ticket => $Ticket ) }

    or adding the following for the html version:

        { RT::Extension::NonWatcherRecipients->FindRecipients(
            Transaction => $Transaction, Ticket => $Ticket, Format => 'text/html' ) }

    As described below, this method returns a message which is then inserted
    into your template. Look at the installed template for an example. You
    may also call the method and use the returned string however you'd like.

METHODS
  FindRecipients
    Search headers for recipients not included as watchers on the ticket and
    return a message to insert in the outgoing email to notify participants.

    Takes:

        (Transaction => $Transaction, Ticket => $Ticket, Format => 'text/html')

    Transaction and Ticket are the objects provided in the RT template.
    Format is an optional parameter that accepts either 'text/plain' or
    'text/html' and defaults to 'text/plain' if not specified.

    Returns: a message to insert in a template
