NAME

    Alien::Build::Plugin::Fetch::Rewrite - Alien::Build plugin to rewrite
    network requests to local resources

VERSION

    version 0.01

SYNOPSIS

    In your ~/.alienbuild/rc.pl:

     postload 'Fetch::Rewrite';
     
     sub rewrite {
       my($build, $uri) = @_;
       
       # $uri isa URI
       
       if($uri->host eq 'ftp.gnu.org')
       {
         # if we see a request to ftp.gnu.org (either ftp or http)
         # we redirect it to the local mirror at
         # http://mirror.example.com/ftp.gnu.org
         $uri->scheme('http');
         $uri->host('mirror.example.com');
         $uri->host('/ftp.gnu.org' . $uri->path);
       }
     }

DESCRIPTION

    This plugin allows you to rewrite the URLs for remote networked
    resources to local resources. This is useful if you are building CPAN
    modules that rely on Alien distributions where you do not have system
    packages. It may also seem useful if you do not trust the remote
    resources, although please keep in mind that like a Makefile.PL or
    Build.PL, an alienfile is arbitrary Perl code, and should be
    appropriately vetted before being used in an environment with security
    requirements.

CAVEATS

    This plugin is only able to rewrite URLs that are fetched through the
    standard Alien::Build URL fetching interface, and only URLs that are
    supported by LWP::UserAgent and URI.
