win version 0.03
================

The goal of win, the Perl Win32 programming tool, is to make 
Perl Win32 programming simpler, quicker, and less of a hassle. 
The win tool seeks to achieve its goal by:

1. Addressing the integration of Win32 modules.
2. Addressing Win32 idiosyncrasies.

You can call other Win32 modules via win and if your system 
doesn't have the module, win is polite enough to download and 
install the module for you (using PPM). 

By default, win also enables a few useful Win32 modules, 
specifically Win32::Autoglob and Win32::Die. You can think of 
win as a broom that sweeps the idiosyncrasies of Windows under
the rug. It is good to know what those idiosyncrasies are, but 
sometimes you don't want to deal with them. If that's ever the 
case, then win is for you.

INSTALLATION 

It's all pure Perl, so just put the .pm file in its appropriate 
local Perl subdirectory.
