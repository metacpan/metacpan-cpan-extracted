=head1 NAME

pastorize - Generate Perl classes with XML bindings starting from a W3C XSD Schema

=head1 SYNOPSIS 

  pastorize [options] schema1 schema2 ...
  
  Options:  --help, --man, --verbose, --debug, --mode, --style, --module, --destination, --class_prefix, --complex_isa, --simple_isa
  
=head1 OPTIONS

=item ARGUMENTS

Argument is a file name or the URL to the B<W3C XSD schema> file to be processed. 

Be careful about the paths that are mentioned for any included schemas though. If these are relative, they
will be taken relative to the current schema being processed. In the case of a schema string, the resolution
of relative paths for the included schemas is undefined.

Currently, it is also possible to pass multiple schemas, in which case the schemas will be processed in order
and merged to the same model for code generation. Just make sure you don't have name collisions in the schemas though.

=item THE OPTIONS

=over

=item mode

This parameter effects what actually will be done by the method. Either offline code generation, or run-time
code evaluation, or just returning the generated code.

=over

=item offline

B<Default>.

In this mode, the code generation is done 'offline', that is, similar to Java's Castor way of doing things, the generated code 
will be written to disk on module files under the path given by the L</destination> parameter.

In 'offline'  mode, it is possible to generate a single module with all the generated clasess or multiple modules
one for each class, depending on the value of the L</style> parameter. 

The typical use of the offline mode is during a 'make' process, where you have a set of XSD schemas and you
generate your modules to be later installed by 'make install'. This is very similar to Java Castor's behaviour. 
This way your XSD schemas don't have to be accessible during run-time and you don't have a performance penalty.

  # Generate MULTIPLE modules, one module for each class, and put them under destination.
  pastorize --mode offline --style multiple --destination /tmp/lib/perl --class_prefix MyApp::Data /some/path/to/schema.xsd 
    
=item eval 

In 'I<eval>' (run-time) mode, the XSD schema is processed at 
run-time giving much more flexibility to the user. In this mode, no code will be written to disk. Instead, the generated code 
(which is necessarily a L</single> block) will be evaluated before returning to the caller. 

The added flexibility has a price on the other hand, namely a performance penalty and 
the fact that the XSD schema needs to be accessible at run-time. Note that the performance penalty applies only to the code genereration (pastorize) phase; 
the generated classes perform the same as if they were generated offline.

Note that 'eval' mode forces the L</style> parameter to have a value of 'single';

  # Generate classes in MEMORY, and EVALUATE the generated code on the fly.
  pastorize --mode eval --class_prefix MyApp::Data /some/path/to/schema.xsd 
    

=item return 

In 'return'  mode, the XSD schema is processed but no code is written to disk or evaluated. In this mode, the method
just returns the generated block of code as a string, so that you may use it to your liking. You would typically be evaluating 
it though.

Note that 'return' mode forces the L</style> parameter to have a value of 'single';


=item print 

Like 'return' mode, but also prints the resulting string on STDOUT. 

=back

=item style

This parameter determines if XML::Pastor will generate a single module where all classes reside (L</single>), or 
multiple modules one for each class (L</multiple>).

Some modes (such as L</eval> and L</return>)force the style argument to be 'single'.

Possible values are :

=over 

=item single 

One block of code containg all the generated classes will be produced. This will be put in the module given by the
'module' argument (or otherwise the class_prefix).

=item multiple 

A separate piece of code for each class will be produced. In addition, a module that 'uses' each of the 
individual generated modules will be created whose name is given by the 'module' argument (or otherwise it's 
given by 'class_prefix').

=back

=item class_prefix

If present, the names of the generated classes will be prefixed by this value. 
You may end the value with '::' or not, it's up to you. It will be autocompleted. 
In other words both 'MyApp::Data' and 'MyApp::Data::' are valid. 

=item destination

This is the directory prefix where the produced modules will be written in I<offline> mode. In other modes (I<eval> and I<return>), it is ignored.

Note that the trailing slash ('/') is optional. The default value for this parameter is '/tmp/lib/perl/'.

=item module

This parameter has sense only when generating one big chunk of code (L</style> => L</single>) in offline L</mode>. 

It denotes the name of the module (without the .pm extension) that will be written to disk in this case. 

=item complex_isa

Via this parameter, it is possible to indicate a common ancestor (or ancestors) of all complex types that are generated by XML::Pastor.
The generated complex types will still have XML::Pastor::ComplexType as their last ancestor in their @ISA, but they will also have the class whose  
name is given by this parameter as their first ancestor. Handy if you would like to add common behaviour to all your generated classes. 

This parameter can have a string value (the usual case) or an array reference to strings. In the array case, each item is added to the @ISA array (in that order) 
of the generated classes.

=item simple_isa

Via this parameter, it is possible to indicate a common ancestor (or ancestors) of all simple types that are generated by XML::Pastor.
The generated simple types will still have XML::Pastor::SimpleType as their last ancestor in their @ISA, but they will also have the class whose  
name is given by this parameter as their first ancestor. Handy if you would like to add common behaviour to all your generated classes. 

This parameter can have a string value (the usual case) or an array reference to strings. In the array case, each item is added to the @ISA array (in that order) 
of the generated classes.

=item verbose

This parameter indicates the desired level of verbosity of the output. A value of zero (0), which is the default, indicates 'silent' operation where only a fatal
error will result in a 'die' which will in turn write on STDERR. A higher value of 'verbose' indicates more and more chatter on STDERR.
Setting 'debug' will currently put 'verbose' to level 9.

=item debug

Currently all that this option does is to put the verbose level to 9. 

=back

=head1 BUGS & CAVEATS

There no known bugs at this time, but this doesn't mean there are aren't any. 
Note that, although some testing was done prior to releasing the module, this should still be considered alpha code. 
So use it at your own risk.

There are known limitations however:

=over 

=item * Namespaces

The namespace support is somewhat shaky. Currently at most one I<targetNamspace> is supported. 
Multiple target namespaces are not supported. That's why schema 'import' facility does not work. 

=item * Schema import

The 'import' element of W3C XSD schema is not supported at this time. This is basically because of namespace complexities. If you think of a 
way to support the 'import' feature, please let me know. 

=item * 'mixed' elements

Elements with 'mixed' content (text and child elements) are not supported at this time.

=item * substitution groups

Substitution groups are not supported at this time.

=item * Encoding

Only the UTF-8 encoding is supported. You should make sure that your data is in UTF-8 format. It may be possible to read (but not write) XML from other encodings. 
But this feature is not tested at this time. 

=item * Default values for attributes

Default values for attributes are not supported at this time. If you can think of a simple way to support this, please let me know.

=back

Note that there may be other bugs or limitations that the author is not aware of.
