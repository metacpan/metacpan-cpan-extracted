0.2 Summary
===========

Module::LocalBuild is used to call 'perl Makefile.PL' and friends on
packages in a local working copy of a source code repository.  This
allows people to have local copies of Perl modules, and edit them at
will without having to worry about when to compile them.

   It also allows the same sources to be simultaneously built and
maintained under different operating systems.

   For more details see Module::LocalBuild manpage, and the
t/30_locaboot.t test which calls the example t/localboot.pl boot script.
