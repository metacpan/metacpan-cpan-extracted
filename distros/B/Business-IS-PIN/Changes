Revision history for Perl extension Business::IS::PIN

0.06 2010-03-12 21:21:08

    - Fix RT#55252: "Persons born on the 30th/31st mistakenly
      identified as companies" reported by Philip Newton.

    - Move the module over to Dist::Zilla while I was at it

0.05 Fri Dec 21 2007

    - Stopped using Module::Install in favour of ExtUtils::MakeMaker

    - Use split(//) not unpack('(A)*'). split is faster in 5.10 (yay me!)
      and the unpack format doesn't work in 5.6p
