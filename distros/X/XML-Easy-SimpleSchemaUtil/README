NAME

XML::Easy::SimpleSchemaUtil - help with simple kinds of XML schema

DESCRIPTION

The rules by which some class of thing is encoded in XML constitute a
schema.  (A schema does not need to be codified in a formal language such
as Schematron: a natural-language specification can also be a schema.
Even if there is no explicit specification at all, the behaviour of
the interoperating processors of related XML documents constitutes a de
facto schema.)  Certain kinds of rule are commonly used in all manner
of schemata.  This module supplies functions that help to implement such
common kinds of rule, regardless of how a schema is specified.

This module processes XML data in the form used by XML::Easy, consisting
of XML::Easy::Element and XML::Easy::Content objects and twine arrays.
In this form, character data are stored fully decoded, so they can be
manipulated with no knowledge of XML syntax.
