1.44 Jan 4, 2010

    [ ENHANCEMENTS ]

    - Use Log::Any to log various events, such as the start and end of each
  request and each component call.

    - Add $m->log, allowing easy logging to a component-specific namespace.

    - Fix use of CHI when no data directory is specified.

1.43 Dec 25, 2009

    [ BUG FIXES ]

    - If a component was located in a patch with spaces, the feature which
  referred to errors by their source file line number was broken. This could
  cause test failures if the package was downloaded into a path with spaces by
  CPAN. Reported by Shawn Moore. RT #53072.

    - HTML::Entities is no longer an optional dependency. This fixes some issues
  with packaged versions of Mason. Reported by Jens Rehsack. RT #48890.

    - $m->flush_buffer is now ignored when inside $m->scomp or $m->content. Patch
  by Frédéric Brière, with extra tests from Ruslan Zakirov. RT #38924.

1.42 May 7, 2009

    [ BUG FIXES ]

    - Fix 10b-cache-chi.t to work with latest version of CHI - expire_if
  and ref of cache changed

    - Fixed a bug where attempting to load a module that failed to compile
  in a Mason component could mask the compilation error. RT #39803.

    - Fixed the print method in HTML::Mason::FakeApache. It was including
  the object itself in the output. Patch by Martin Petricek. RT
  #43035.

1.41  May 5, 2009

    [ BUG FIXES ]

    - This is a one-fix release to get this module working with the latest
  version of Exception::Class (1.27).

1.40  Jul 24, 2008

    [ BUG FIXES ]

    - Attempting to set multiple cookies when running under CGIHandler
  failed. Patch by Andrej Czapszys. RT #33710.

    - The Request->alter_superclass() method could cause a segfault
  (sometimes) with perl 5.10.0. Reported and patched by Jesse Vincent.

1.39  Jan 30, 2008

    [ ENHANCEMENTS ]

    - CHI may now be used as the backend for $m->cache as an updated
  alternative to Cache::Cache.  Among other things, this facilitates
  easy use of Cache::FastMmap and memcached for data
  caching. Cache::Cache is still the default for now, and is still
  listed as a prereq for Mason.

1.38  Dec 20, 2007

    [ BUG FIXES ]

    - (Hopefully) fixed a problem where the cpan shell thought that Mason
  needed mod_perl1 as a prereq when it was trying to require a newish
  version of mod_perl2.

    - If you called $r->send_http_header() explicitly in a component under
  mod_perl 1.x, headers would end up getting sent again once the
  component finished executing. Reported by Brett Gardner.

    - Component call with content end tags could not span multiple
  lines. Fixing this makes it consistent with the opening tag. Patch
  by Alex Robinson.

    - Includes a possible fix for a test failure in 10-cache.t. This
  failure is a problem in the test code, not the Mason core code.

1.37  Sep 6, 2007

    [ BUG FIXES ]

    - Mason could send the HTTP headers twice under mod_perl 1.x when
  making a request for a directory path that was handled by a
  dhandler. Reported by David Beaudet.

    - If you set the Content-Type header in a handler sub before passing
  control to Mason via ApacheHandler, this value was overwritten if
  the request was for a directory path.

    [ ENHANCEMENTS ]

    - Make t/08-ah.t and t/16-live-cgi.t more verbose about why they are
  skipping tests when they do so. Based on a patch from
  C.J. Adams-Collier.

1.36  Jun 10, 2007

    [ BUG FIXES ]

    - If a component with content call ending tag appeared inside a
  subcomp or method without an opening tag, then the compiler dies
  with a Perl error, rather than reporting the error
  usefully. Reported by Rich Williams.

    - Under mod_perl 2, if decline_dirs was false and a directory was
  requested, you got a "Use of uninitialized value" warning from
  ApacheHandler in your logs. Reported by Ogden Nefix.

    - HTML::Entities is now a prereq. Not requiring it made for various
  weird gyrations in the tests that didn't seem to work all the time,
  causing various failures. Fixes RT #24827.

    - Request::CGIHandler->exec() now returns the return value from
  executing the component, just like a normal Request. Reported by
  Adrian Irving-Beer.

    [ ENHANCEMENTS ]

    - Added a new Compiler::ToObject parameter,
  named_component_subs. Turning this on makes it possible to profile
  components.

    - Added a new Request parameter, component_error_handler. This can be
  set to change how component compilation and runtime errors are
  handled. It can also be set to false to just let errors go
  unhandled, which could speed up apps that throw a lot of non-object
  exceptions.

1.35  Oct 17, 2006

    [ BUG FIXES ]

    - Version 1.34 introduced a bug that caused corruption of the callers
      stack when a component call with content was used.

    - When Mason tried to load a package required for a feature (like
      Cache::Cache for $m->cache) and this failed, the error message would
      say something like "Can't locate Cache::Cache". However, the real
      error could be that Cache::Cache was present, but a module required by
      Cache::Cache was not. Now we report the real missing module.

    - Some people saw a spurious test failure in 05-request.t. RT #22099.

    - Added Module::Build to the build_requires prereqs.

1.34  Oct 14, 2006

    [ BUG FIXES ]

    - List Module::Build as a build prereq in the Build.PL, so it shows up
      in META.yml. Reported by Colin Henein. RT #22097.

    - Apache::Request and mod_perl{1,2} will no longer show up as prereqs
      in META.yml. Requested by Jesse Vincent.

    - Fixed a serious memory leak bug where an object referenced in
      arguments to another component was never destroyed. Reported by
      Dominic Mitchell.

    - Using $m->call_next from a helper component should reset base_comp
      to the request_comp.  Reported by Mark Elrod.

    - The 08-ah.t and 16-live-cgi.t test files could fail with an error
      like "Failed to re-load 'Mason::Build'" when Mason was being installed
      via the CPANPLUS shell (and maybe other cases). Reported by David
      Wheeler.

    - Fixed a bug where $m->clear_buffer inside a component called from a
      comp_with_content did not clear all buffers.

    [ ENHANCEMENTS ]

    - Added support for get_server_port() in FakeApache. Patch from Dieter
      Piercey.

1.33  May 28, 2006

    [ BUG FIXES ]

    - If $m->flush_buffer() was called when there was a filter somewhere
      in the component chain, the flush did nothing. Task id #596. Reported
      by Shane McCarron.

    - Added several tests for $m->flush_buffer() and $m->clear_buffer(),
      which will hopefully avoid more bugs in this part of the code.

    - On Win32, a test failed when Mason tried to use rename to move a dir
      into an existing dir. Patch by Shane McCarron. Task id #594 and RT
      #17828.

    - Trying to load HTML::Mason::ApacheHandler outside of mod_perl caused
      an error "like Undefined subroutine &Apache::perl_hook called at
      /usr/local/share/perl/5.8.7/HTML/Mason/ApacheHandler.pm line
      257". While it will never _run_ outside of mod_perl, it should at
      least load.

    - Fixed test in 14a-fake_apache.t that failed with CGI.pm >= 3.16.

    - The example code in the HTML::Mason::Resolver::Null code was
      just wrong. Fixed by John Siracusa.

    - Fixed a test failure in 06-compile.t when using bleadperl. RT
      #17118.

1.32  January 3, 2006

    [ BUG FIXES ]

    - Under mod_perl 1.x with error_mode set to output, the headers were
      sent after the content when a compilation error occurred.  Reported by
      Gareth Kirwan.  Task id #592.

    - URI-escape utf8 characters the same way that CGI::escape and
      URI::Escape::uri_escape_utf8 do.  Patch by Denis Shaposhnikov.

    - On startup Mason creates a file named ".__obj_create_marker" in the
      object directory.  Under mod_perl, Mason was not chmod'ing the file
      when Apache was started as root. This led to permission errors in
      environments where the Interp is created anew every request.  Task id
      #593.

    - Treat the return value of component execution as a string in
      ApacheHandler.  This prevent warnings about comparing the empty string
      to a number when a component returns "".  Reported by Benjamin Franz.

    - Setting a MasonPlugins Apache parameter caused a fatal error.  Patch
      by David Jack Olrik.

    - Calling base_comp() on the Request object inside a plugin's
      start_request_hook method caused an infinite recursion in Mason.
      Reported by Jesse Vincent.

1.3101  August 23, 2005

    [ BUG FIXES ]

    - One last fix for CGIHandler.  If you provided your own out_method it
      was ignoring it and using its own.  Reported by David Glasser.

1.31  August 20, 2005

    [ BUG FIXES ]

    - Fix several regressions in the CGIHandler and FakeApache modules.
      Some changes from the stable branch were never merged into the trunk
      before 1.30.  Reported by Jesse Vincent.  Task id #589.

    - Under Apache2, if an ApacheHandler object was created during server
      startup and the associated Interp object created any files or
      directories, Mason would crash when attempting to chown those
      files/dirs to the uid/gid that Apache will use after forking.  Task
      #586.

    - The compiler was adding an extra block around a component's
      body, which meant that variables declared in the body (in perl lines
      or blocks) were not seen in the cleanup section.  Task id #587.

    - The compiler was also adding "no warnings 'uninitialized'" in this
      block, which could hide various errors.

    - Hopefully fix $VERSION in ApacheHandler so PAUSE will not be
      confused and think we have regressed.

    - Turned off some prompts during the module's installation.  These
      were intended to help new users configure Apache to run Mason
      components, but they're probably a bit confusing.  Will return in a
      future release as a separate script that can be run from the command
      line.

1.30  August 11, 2005

    [ INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES ]

    - ** Under mod_perl2, MasonArgsMethod will default to "CGI", since
      libapreq2 is still in development.  If you have successfully installed
      libapreq2, just set MasonArgsMethod to "mod_perl" to use it.

    [ ENHANCEMENTS ]

    - Some doc tweaks to clarify that Mason should work out of the box
      with both mod_perl 1 and 2.
    - Added "use warnings" to all modules and made sure all tests ran
      warnings-free.

    [ BUG FIXES ]

    - Silence a warning when HTML::Mason::ApacheHandler was loaded outside
      of mod_perl.
    - Support renamed Apache2::Status module.

1.29_02  June 22, 2005

    [ ENHANCEMENTS ]

    - ** Support for mod_perl-2.00 (mod_perl-1.99 is no longer supported
      because of API changes in 2.0RC5).
    - Mason recovers more gracefully from an empty or corrupted object
      file. Task id #579.

    [ BUG FIXES ]

    - Fixed bug with content type being reset when decline_dirs=0.
      Submitted by Brian Phillips. Task id #584.
    - Put "Mason" prefix back in Params.pod. Task id #575.
    - Fixed fetch_comp(undef) to not return an empty hash. Task id #578.
    - static_source_touch_file did not take effect until after one request
      for a top-level component.  Reported by Lai Zit Seng. Task id #576.

1.29_01  January 25, 2005

    [ INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES ]

    - ** Mason now requires Perl 5.6.0 or later. However, because 5.6.0
      has so many problems, it cannot be officially supported; we strongly
      recommend upgrading to at least 5.6.1.
    - ** Mason now requires version 1.24 of mod_perl in the ApacheHandler
      module.
    - ** The behaviors of $m->flush_buffer and $m->clear_buffer have been
      simplified. $m->flush_buffer only acts on the top-level output buffer;
      $m->clear_buffer clears all output buffers. Task id #554.
    - ** max_code_cache_size is now kept in terms of number of components,
      not bytes, and its default value is 'unlimited'.
    - ** Components with a <%filter> and a cache_self are no longer cached
      in their filtered state. Performance-related code simplifications made
      this behavior difficult to maintain. Long term this would be
      easier to implement with a cache_self component <%flag>.
    - ** All compiler properties are now read-only. If you need to change
      compiler properties on a per-request basis, you'll need to create
      multiple compiler and interpreter objects.
    - ** comp_exists may try to load the designated component, and may
      throw an error if it contains a syntax error.
    - ** The current_time method, deprecated in 1.1x, has been removed.
    - ** The HTML::Mason::Buffer class has been eliminated for performance
      reasons. You can use separate components, methods, or subcomponents
      and scomp to achieve the same effects as buffer pushes and pops.

    [ ENHANCEMENTS ]

    - Significantly improved performance in component execution,
      especially in static_source mode.
    - Added static_source_touch_file, making it much easier to update
      a server running in static_source mode.
    - Added a plugin architecture. Plugin classes can perform actions at
      key points, e.g. before and after each request and each component
      call.  See HTML::Mason::Plugin for documentation. Task id #24.
      Initial implementation by Doug Treder.
    - Added the ability to change component root(s) on the fly if the
      dynamic_comp_root parameter is turned on. Task id #561. Suggested
      by Alex Robinson.
    - Added enable_autoflush parameter. When turned off, Mason can
      compile components to a more efficient form.
    - Changed the </&> tag to allow the starting component name to be
      included. e.g. <&| /foo &> ... </& /foo >. Task id #556. Suggested
      by Alex Robinson, John Williams, and others.
    - Moved the notion of component roots (single and multiple) from the
      Resolver to the Interpreter. This improved the performance of multiple
      component roots in conjunction with static source mode. Any resolver,
      file-based or otherwise, can benefit from component root settings or
      choose to ignore them.
    - Added the compiler object_id to the object file path, so that
      multiple versions of Mason do not collide in the same object
      directory. Task id #569.
    - Added .obj (or a configurable extension) to object filenames.
      Task id #152. Suggested by John Tobey.
    - Added $m->clear_and_abort, syntactic sugar for the common idiom
      of calling clear_buffer() and then abort(). Task id #505.
    - Added an official comment syntax, <% # ... %>, and documented
      the various comment markers in the developer's manual. Task id #566.
    - Added buffer_preallocate_size parameter, which allows you to
      potentially reduce buffer reallocations.
    - Augmented the 'could not find component' error message with the
      current component root(s). Task id #562.

    [ BUG FIXES ]

    - Mason now throws an error if the path specified in a component's
      'inherit' flag cannot be found. Task id #480.
    - Fixed comp_exists to work with any path accepted by comp or
      fetch_comp, and fixed fetch_comp to stop throwing errors for certain
      bad paths. Task id #572.
    - Fixed $m->decline to work from /dhandler. Task id #573. Submitted
      by Carl Raiha.
    - Using 'next' or 'last' without a loop can no longer corrupt
      the component stack. Task id #539.

1.28  November 6, 2004

      This version is entirely identical to 1.27 except for a fix to make
      CPAN/PAUSE properly index the version number in
      HTML::Mason::ApacheHandler.  If you already installed 1.27 you do not
      need to install this version unless you want to fix the "out of date
      modules" report from the CPAN or CPANPLUS shells.

1.27  October 28, 2004

    [ ENHANCEMENTS ]

    - Full support for Apache2/mod_perl2.

    [ BUG FIXES ]

    - The request object was not available as $m in the preamble if
      in_package was set.  Reported by David Wheeler and David Baird.  Task
      id #538.

    - Component with subcomponents or methods were not getting freed when
      they were purged from the code cache.  Task id #549.

    - Component calls (<& &>) starting with a newline were compiled
      incorrectly. Reported by Rick Delaney. Task id #564.

    - If both a parent request and subrequest had autoflush set, output
      from the subrequest wasn't actually flushed.  Reported by Tony
      Clayton.  Task id #550.

    - The documentation in HTML::Mason::Tests for the path and call_path
      parameters was wrong.  Reported by Michael Gray.  Task id #528.

    - Line numbers in errors were incorrectly reported if the error
      happened in code after an <%args>, <%attr>, or <%flags> block.
      Reported by Tony Clayton.  Task id #552.

    - The Apache handler now only sends headers once if make_request()
      aborts, such as when a redirect is executed in a
      MasonX::Interp::WithCallbacks callback.

1.26  April 5, 2004

    [ BUG FIXES ]

    - The fix to make CGIHandler support flush_buffer and autoflush caused
      it to not rethrow any exceptions created during the request.  If
      error_mode was set to 'fatal', then an error would simply cause no
      output to be generated.  Task id #531.

    - A comment in the last line of a component call with content caused a
      syntax error in the compiled component.  Reported by Todd Goldenbaum.
      Task id #530.

    - The various request handling methods in CGIHandler once again return
      the value of calling the Interp object's exec() method.

    - CGIHandler now explicitly handles redirect statuses when an abort
      exception is thrown from the Interp object's exec() method.  This
      fixes some problems when this module was used with David Wheeler's
      MasonX::Interp::WithCallbacks module.

    - Using a <%shared> block when "in_package" was set to something other
      than HTML::Mason::Commands led to an error like "Can't call method
      "call_dynamic" on an undefined value".  Reported by David Wheeler.
      Task id #535.

1.25  December 12, 2003

    [ BUG FIXES ]

    - CGIHandler did not support $m->flush_buffer or autoflush.  Reported
      by Shane McCarron.
    - Every line in the error stacktrace had a 'g' appended to it in HTML
      error mode.
    - The HTML error display of the stacktrace was not filtering out some
      packages that it should have, so there were extra lines that made it
      harder to find the real error.
    - Several FakeApache methods were broken: path_info, uri, and
      the_request.  Reported by Matthias F. Brandstetter.

    [ ENHANCEMENTS ]

    - The CGIHandler request object now supports the autoflush parameter.

1.24  November 12, 2003

    [ BUG FIXES ]

    - Two tests in 04-misc.t, #9 and #10, failed if Params::Validate 0.66+
      was installed.  This happened because an error message given by
      Params::Validate changed slightly, and was not a problem in the Mason
      core code.
    - The Component object method attr_if_exists returned 0 when the
      attribute didn't exist, instead of undef as is documented.  Reported
      by Chris Reinhardt.
    - The HTML::Mason::Resolver::File glob_path method, which is used for
      the preloads feature, now uses File::Glob::bsd_glob when run with Perl
      5.6.0+.  This function properly handles spaces in filenames, which are
      legal on most systems, and common on Win32.  Implemented by Autrijus
      Tang.
    - The Admin guide erroneously said that the default component root
      when running Mason outside a web environment was "/".  It is the
      current working directory.  Reported by Patrick Kane.

1.23  September 8, 2003

    [ ENHANCEMENTS ]

    - Lots of enhancements to the Apache.pm emulation when using the
      CGIHandler module.  Implemented by David Wheeler.
    - The fact that autohandlers or dhandlers can be turned off by setting
      autohandler_name or dhandler_name to "" has now been documented, and
      we explicitly check for this in the code.  Task id #499.
    - The ApacheHandler module now handles certain exceptions
      (TopLevelNotFound, Abort, Decline) thrown from the Interp class's
      make_request method by returning the desired error code.  With the
      default Mason Interp & Request classes, this will never happen.
      However, subclasses may want to throw exceptions when constructing a
      request.  Implemented by David Wheeler.

    [ BUG FIXES ]

    - If any code type parameters were set in the httpd.conf file, Mason
      died trying to read them.  This bug was introduced in version 1.20.
      Task id #496.  Reported by David Wheeler.
    - $m->caller, $m->callers and $m->caller_args now return undef or an
      empty list instead of crashing when the specified stack level does not
      exist. Task id #495.  Reported by Bernhard Schmalhofer.
    - The busy_lock option to $m->cache->get did not accept did not accept
      string values for durations, like "4m".  Task id #484.  Reported by
      Igor Muratov.
    - When generating the HTML error message page, we now only use basic
      HTML escaping.  This fixes two problems.  One is that if
      HTML::Entities is not installed, using the "|h" escape flag in the
      error display component causes an endless loop.  The other is that the
      "|h" flag can mangle non-Latin-1 characters.  Task ids #497 and #494.
      Reported by Harmen and Oleg Bartunov respectively.
    - If a component generated output, then called another component via
      $m->scomp, and that other component attempted to clear the buffer and
      then abort, any output generated before the call to $m->scomp was
      still sent to the client.  This broke calling $m->redirect inside an
      $m->scomp call.  Task id #498.  Reported by Kim Alexander Hansen.

1.22  July 14, 2003

    [ ENHANCEMENTS ]

    - Added $m->has_content to check for content without evaluating it.
    - Comments are now allowed on separate lines inside <%attr> and
      <%flags> blocks.  Task id #475.
    - $m->subexec and $m->make_subrequest now accept relative paths which
      are interpreted relative to the current component directory, like
      $m->comp.
    - Documented potential problems if call to $m->redirect is trapped in
      an eval block, and then output is generated before the exception is
      rethrown.  Task id #477.

    [ BUG FIXES ]

    - If a component with a filter section called abort, the filter was
      run twice.  Task id #473.
    - If an exception was thrown when creating a request, memory was
      leaked.  This can happen when the top-level component cannot be
      found (e.g. 404) or if there is an error in compiling the top-level
      component. Task id #478. Reported by Doug Treder.
    - Removed the use of alarm() and SIG{ALRM} to trap rare infinite loops
      inside the compilation of components. It interfered with Mason
      environments that use alarm() for their own purposes, and the
      associated test would crash in certain Perl environments. If you find
      that Mason sometimes enters an infinite loop, see the
      "Hanging Processes: Detection and Diagnostics" section of the mod_perl
      guide for hints on diagnosing the problem.  Task id #472.
    - Mason allowed a component to define two subcomponents or methods
      with the same name.  Task id #476.  Reported by John Michael Mars.

1.21  June 4, 2003

    [ INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES ]

    - ** The semantics of @_ for components now match Perl subroutines: @_
      contains aliases to the caller's arguments, instead of copies.  For
      example, if a component updates $_[0], the corresponding argument is
      updated (or an error occurs if it is not updateable). The only users
      that will notice this are those that update elements of @_ in
      components and do not expect those changes to affect the caller. If
      you have any doubts, grep your component tree for '\$_\[' and look for
      assignment statements.

    [ ENHANCEMENTS ]

    - Cache the result of taint_is_on() for performance.
    - Mason was copying arguments several times for a request, and several
      more times for each component call. The unnecessary copies have been
      eliminated.  As part of eliminating these copies, a new compiler
      parameter has been added, "define_args_hash".  The default setting,
      "auto", should work with all existing Mason components.  See the
      HTML::Mason::Compiler::ToObject docs for details.  Task id #464.
      Suggested by Doug Treder.
    - Added more details about subclassing the compiler to the Subclassing
      documentation.
    - There is now a compiler parameter called "use_source_line_numbers",
      which can be used to turn off line numbering based on the source file.
      This can be useful when single stepping a component through the
      debugger.  Task id #461.

    [ BUG FIXES ]

    - Fixed a serious error in which a Compiler that was used on a
      component containing certain kinds of syntax errors would claim that
      any future components also contained syntax errors.  Task id #467.
    - Now assigning runtime properties (such as interp) to method
      component objects as well as subcomponent objects.  Task id #462.
    - Fixed the HTML error display.  Errors were not being properly
      HTML-escaped.  Task id #468.  Reported by Jeremy Blain.
    - A bad interaction between the XS version of Params::Validate, Perl
      5.00503 and taint mode has been "fixed" by requiring Params::Validate
      0.59, where the problem is fixed.  Task id #470.
    - The test suite now runs the taint mode tests with earlier versions
      of Perl.  Task id #471.
    - The ApacheHandler module would go into an infinite memory-eating
      loop when run in taint mode with Perl 5.6.1.  Task id #469.  Reported
      by William McKee.

1.20  May 1, 2003 (May Day)

    [ ENHANCEMENTS ]

    - Added an $m->notes() method, which is similar to $r->pnotes() but
      may be used outside a mod_perl environment.  Task id #449.
    - Mason will now only convert non-reference exceptions to
      HTML::Mason::Exception objects, so it should cooperate better with
      modules like Error.pm.  Task id #446.
    - Added more documentation on Mason's error handling and exception
      system.  Task id #446.
    - If Mason was configured via the Apache httpd.conf file, it could in
      many cases be quite a bit slower than configuration via a custom
      handler subroutine.  Now configuration via the httpd.conf is much
      faster, and is only about 5% slower than a custom handler subroutine.
      Reported by Jeremy Blain.
    - Mason's test harness now gives verbose output when the TEST_VERBOSE
      environment variable is true.  This eliminates the need for setting
      MASON_VERBOSE.
    - ** It is now an error to have a subcomponent and method with the
      same name in a single component.

    [ BUG FIXES ]

    - Mason would die if asked to compile a component that evaluates
      to a false value.  Task id #444.  Reported by David Wheeler.
    - Mason now gives a better error message if you try to call a
      component's methods or subcomponents from its <%shared> block.  Task
      id #448.  Reported by Randy Harmon.
    - If in_package was set, Mason would die if output was generated after
      a subrequest.  Task id #453.  Reported by David R. Baird.
    - If Perl's print() was called after a subrequest, Mason would die
      when run with any Perl before 5.8.0.  Task id #458.
    - If a component called $m->cache_self, and then $m->decline, no
      output would be generated.  Task id #454.  Patch by Vadim Ustiansky.

1.19  March 3, 2003

    [ BUG FIXES ]

    - Fixed a very nasty bug that could cause subcomponents or methods
      from one component to show up in another components.  Task id #443 in
      todo list.
    - If the closing tag of a <%flags>, <%attr>, or <%args> block
      contained upper case characters, the component would not be parsed
      properly.  Reported by Chris Snyder.  Task id #440 in
      todo list.
    - Providing a Resolver object directly to the ApacheHandler
      constructor caused a fatal error.  Reported by Kwindla Kramer.  Task
      id #441 in todo list.

1.18  January 24, 2003

    [ BUG FIXES ]

    - Require Exception::Class 1.09.  Version 1.08 has a bug that causes
      problems with Mason when used with any Perl earlier than 5.8.0.
    - Fix a bug in the lexer code that caused Mason to not work with Perl
      5.00503 at all.

1.17  January 17, 2003

    [ ENHANCEMENTS ]

    - Added "REQUEST:" as a component specifier for method comp calls,
      similar to "SELF:" and "PARENT:".  "REQUEST:" is short-hand for
      $m->request_comp.  Suggested by Manuel Capinha, among others.
    - Added $m->call_self.  This was present in Mason pre-1.10, and has
      been added back per Jon Swartz's request.
    - Added $comp->attributes, similar to $comp->methods.  This just
      returns attributes for a given component object.  It doesn't return
      attributes inherited from a parent.  Suggested by Matti Makitalo.

    [ BUG FIXES ]

    - ** When $m->cache_self was used for a component with a filter block,
      the output would be cached _before_ filtering, and filtered every time
      it was retrieved from the cache.  This has been fixed, and the
      documentation now specifies that the filtered output is cached.
    - Fixed failure of 12-taint.t #7 on Win32 boxes.  Reported by Randy
      Kobes.
    - Without HTML::Entities installed, 13-errors.t #7 failed.  Reported
      by Sam Kington.
    - $m->file did not handle relative paths properly when called from a
      subcomponent or method.  Reported by Chris Hutchinson.
    - If $m->abort was called in the shared block of a component that had
      a filter, then a fatal error occured.  Reported by Chris Pudney.
    - Mason was not cooperating with Apache::Filter, and attempts to
      filter Mason's output did not work.  Fixing this also requires
      Apache::Filter 1.021, if you are using Apache::Request to handling
      incoming arguments.  Reported by by Manuel Capinha.
    - Mason assumed that if Scalar::Util loaded without errors, it had a
      weaken() subroutine.  However, Scalar::Util provides a pure Perl
      implementation that does not include this subroutine.  Now we check
      for this subroutine explicitly.  Reported by Autrijus Tang.
    - Some code constructs, such as qw() lists, would end up being turned
      into invalid code during component compilation.  Reported by Robert
      Landrum.
    - Subclassing a subclass of HTML::Mason::Request broke when the class
      between HTML::Mason::Request and your own class called
      alter_superclass.
    - Under mod_perl 2.0, when ApacheHandler could't resolve a filename to
      a component, it would die instead of returning a not found status.

    [ INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES ]

    - ** Removed the long deprecated and undocumented $comp->parent_comp
      method.  Use $comp->owner instead.

1.16  December 13, 2002

    [ ENHANCEMENTS ]

    - Documented behavior of $m->flush_buffer when a filter is present.
    - Turned off "nowrap" for error message on HTML error page.  No more
      horizontal scrolling!
    - Substantially rewrote portions of the Admin Guide, in order to
      improve and clarify the portions related to configuring and
      customizing Mason under mod_perl.
    - Added back "raw error" on HTML error page.
    - Replaced FilesMatch with LocationMatch in docs and FAQ, because
      using FilesMatch means you can't use dhandlers.
    - Reduced memory usage when compiling large components.  Memory usage
      for smaller components hasn't changed much, but they weren't really a
      problem in the first place.
    - Added a cgi_request method to the CGIHandler::Request object, which
      parallels the apache_req method offered by the ApacheHandler::Request
      object.

    [ BUG FIXES ]

    - When using the code cache within an Interp, a circular reference was
      created which prevented the Interp object from ever being destroyed.
      With Perl 5.6.0+, this will be automatically prevented by using weak
      references as needed.  With Perl 5.00503, you will need to call the
      new Interp->flush_code_cache method in order to break the circular
      reference.  This bug could cause memory leaks with code that created
      new Interp objects over time, though most uses of Mason do not do
      this.  Reported by Kate Porter.
    - Fixed bad parsing of <% $foo || 50 %>.  Mason was interpreting this
      as an escape flag.  Escape flags now much match /^[[:alpha:]_]\w+/ and
      Mason specifically looks for || in a substitution as well.  Reported
      by Kwindla Kramer.
    - If a dhandler one subdirectory down (like /foo/dhandler) called
      $m->decline, Mason threw a bogus exception.  Fixed by Harmen.
    - Running the test suite caused an error in the shell on Win32 with
      newer versions of MakeMaker.  Reported by Murat Unalan.  (We _think_
      this is fixed but we'd like confirmation from a Win32 user).
    - It was not possible to set the data_cache_defaults parameter from
      the httpd.conf file.  Now it is.
    - Mason was using Apache::Request->new instead of
      Apache::Request->instance.  This meant that if you had a handler that
      ran earlier (like a TransHandler) and that handler created an
      Apache::Request object, then the one Mason created would be missing
      any POST arguments.  Reported by Ray Zimmerman.
    - Several different places in the docs said that Cache::Cache accepts
      a username option, but there is no such thing.
    - alter_superclass didn't work with CGIHandler because CGIHandler
      didn't define a $VERSION variable.  Reported by Nadine and Harry
      Laxen.
    - Made CGIHandler merge together POST and query string arguments in
      order to be consistent with ApacheHandler.  Reported by Nadine and Harry
      Laxen.
    - The CGIHandler module was overriding any out_method provided by the
      user.  Reported by Nadine and Harry Laxen.

1.15  October 14, 2002

    [ BUG FIXES ]

    - Fixed a number of problems with filters:
      -- They didn't see changes made to %ARGS (they were seeing a copy).
      -- They couldn't see any variables declared in <%args> blocks.
      -- The presence of a filter caused a call to $m->flush_buffer,
      breaking redirects.
    - Added a number of tests for filters (*cough*).
    - Fixed broken links and other bugs in the POD and HTML versions of
      the docs.
    - Fixed test failures when running as root.  These failures were not
      reflective of bugs in Mason, simply problems in the tests or test
      setup.  Now we skip the tests for end user installs (we still run them
      during development, never fear).
    - HTML::Mason::Request contained code that caused an error when using
      the CPAN shell's "r" command.

1.14  October 7, 2002

    [ BACKWARDS COMPATIBILITY ]

    - Added compatibility layer for 1.0x cache API. It is now possible to
      use $m->cache and $m->cache_self in the old way by setting the
      data_cache_api parameter to '1.0'.
    - Added back $comp->create_time, which was renamed as $comp->load_time
      in 1.09_02, as a deprecated method.
    - Added back $interp->time and $m->current_time, which were removed in
      1.09_01, as deprecated methods.

    [ ENHANCEMENTS ]

    - Implemented the long requested user-defined escapes feature.  It is
      now possible to define your own escape flags, as well as overriding
      Mason's own 'h' and 'u' flags.
    - Implemented expire_if and busy_lock options in new $m->cache->get
      API. These retain the essence of the 1.0x options although both
      work a little differently.
    - Added new module to implement caching extensions,
      HTML::Mason::Cache::BaseCache, with accompanying documentation.
    - Enhanced Params.pod with TOC and full descriptions of all
      parameters.  Standardized rest of documentation to link to Params.pod
      when referring to a parameter.
    - When a component path is not found, but that path matches a file on
      disk, we now print an extra warning, because this indicates that the
      user does not understand the distinction between component paths and
      filesystem paths.
    - The Request object's redirect() method now accepts an optional
      additional argument, allowing users to use a status code other than
      302 for the redirect.
    - Mason should now work on a box with a fresh mod_perl 2/Apache 2
      install.  Previously, Mason unconditionally tried to load
      Apache::Status, which comes with mod_perl 1.x, but not (yet?) with
      mod_perl 2.

    [ BUG FIXES ]

    - Installation was failing when Exception::Class wasn't installed.
    - Calling <%def> subcomponents no longer changes base_comp, which is
      important in autohandlers.  (reported by Ian Robertson)
    - The documentation incorrectly indicated that you could create an
      ApacheHandler object during server startup without providing a
      component root.  This will also shown incorrectly in the sample
      handler.pl in the eg/ directory.
    - Reduced Mason's memory usage when compiling and serving components.
      This is particularly noticeable with very large components (1-2MB or
      greater).  Work on this will continue for future versions.  (reported
      by Todd Holbrook)
    - %ARGS and <%shared> variables could not be accessed from <%filter>.
      (reported by Adam Roth)
    - Switch.pm did not work in file-based components. (reported by Gert
      Thiel)
    - use_strict could not be turned off. (reported by Viacheslav
      Voytovich)
    - $m->clear_buffer (and $m->redirect) did not work inside a component
      call with content. (reported by Manuel Capinha)
    - Some tests were failing on Windows, because they assumed Unix style
      filesystem paths.  This was a problem with the tests, not the core
      code, but still worth fixing.  (reported by Adam Rinehart).
    - $m->caller() was inadvertently left out of the documentation - fixed.
    - Fixed a small documentation error about what kinds of things are
      valid keys in <%flags> and <%attr> blocks.
    - Configuring multiple component roots via the httpd.conf file failed
      silently (as opposed to releases 1.10 - 1.12, where this failed with
      an error).
    - Unreadable component source files caused the confusing error message
      "source callback returned no source".  This will now throw a much more
      helpful exception.
    - Errors occurring in subrequests would cause error output to be mixed
      with regular output when the error_mode was "output" (the default with
      ApacheHandler and CGIHandler).  Errors in subrequests should now look
      the same as errors in the top request.

1.13  August 26, 2002 (Taiwan time)

    [ ENHANCEMENTS ]

    - Replace the regex "[A-Za-z0-9]" with "\w", which should cooperate
      better with Unicode.
    - Added a section called "Avoiding Concurrent Recomputations" to the
      Developer's Manual.  This describes how to achieve the same effect as
      was provided by the "busy locks" feature in 1.0x.
    [ BUG FIXES ]

    - When running under mod_perl, a warning was issued from
      HTML::Mason::Request::ApacheHandler's exec() method.  (reported by
      Marius Feraru)
    - The request wrapper code did not work with anonymous component.
      (reported by Bob McElrath)
    - Mason 1.10-1.12 did not cooperate with Apache::Filter, or any other
      Apache subclass that overrode the print() method.  (reported by Mark
      Moseley)
    - If an object blessed into Apache::Request was provided to
      ApacheHandler's handle_request method, and you were using the
      args_method parameter was set to "mod_perl" (the default), then
      ApacheHandler would die.  This was a bug introduced in 1.12 as a
      result of fixing the memory leaks in 1.11.  (reported by Autrijus
      Tang)
    - Configuring multiple component roots via the httpd.conf file failed.
      (reported and patched by Alexei V. Barantsev)
    - $interp->exec and $m->exec were not respecting wantarray.  (reported
      by David Bushong)
    - Suppress a "subroutine redefined" warning from
      HTML::Mason::Request::Apachehandler's exec() method.  (reported by
      Marius Feraru)
    - Combining cache_self, <%filter> blocks, and $m->scomp did not work.
      (reported by Calle Dybedahl)
    - Tests 4 & 5 for 06-compiler.t would fail if HTML::Entities was not
      installed.  Now they will be skipped if necessary.
    - Tests 75 & 99 for 08-ah.t depended on hash key ordering and would
      fail with Perl 5.8.0.  (submitted by Michael Gray)
    - Fixed a number of cases where the lexer/compiler's behavior differed
      from Mason 1.05 in unintended ways.
      -- Dashes were not being allowed in subcomponent and method names,
      even though this is documented as being allowed.  (reported by Ken
      Miller)
      -- Space between a method or subcomponent name and the '>' at the end
      of the tag was not being allowed.  It should be noted that this is not
      documented as being allowed in the docs, and so may change in the
      future.  But for now, we'd rather be compatible with 1.05.  (reported
      by Chris Hutchinson)
      -- Comments were not being allowed after flag and attribute
      assignments.  Again, this is not documented as being allowed.
      (reported by Chris Hutchinson)
    - CPAN thought that version 1.68 of HTML::Mason::ApacheHandler (part
      of the 1.05 release), was newer than version 1.242 (part of the 1.1201
      release).  This is what we get for using CVS to set verson numbers.
      This version number is now set by hand in order to make sure that this
      does not happen in the future.

1.1201  July 24, 2002

    [ ENHANCEMENTS ]

    - Added details to the UPGRADE document on what has changed with the
      caching system.
    - Added some documentation on how to arbitrarily expire items in the
      cache with the new caching system.  This is in HTML::Mason::Devel.

    [ BUG FIXES ]

    - Fixed a compilation error in HTML::Mason::Tools that was occurring
      with Perl 5.00503.
    - Made sure that <%method> and <%def> tags are treated
      case-insensitively.

1.12  July 23, 2002

    [ ENHANCEMENTS ]

    - Various optimizations have been added to this release in order to
      address the fact that Mason 1.11 is quite a bit slower than 1.05.  One
      major factor was optimizing Params::Validate and Class::Container, so
      for that reason this version of Mason requires Params::Validate 0.24
      and Class::Container 0.07.  With these modules installed, this release
      shows improvements of up to 50-60% in benchmarks that stress Mason's
      weaknesses, with other benchmarks showing up to a 100% improvement.
    - Made subclassing CGIHandler more useful by breaking out its arg
      processing into a request_args method, just like ApacheHandler.
    - Added alter_superclass method to Request class, for use by Request
      subclasses.  See the HTML::Mason::Subclassing document for details.

    [ BUG FIXES ]

    - Fix HTML generated for error messages so that tags balance out.
      Unbalanced table tags caused this page to not display properly with
      Netscape 4.x.
    - Fix nasty memory leaks in ApacheHandler.

1.11  July 3, 2002

    [ BUG FIXES ]

    - The 08-ah.t tests failed with a runtime error if run by root.  This
      was not a Mason bug, but a bug in the test code itself.
    - ApacheHandler did not work Perl 5.005.
    - Even if ApacheHandler was given an Apache::Request object to
      handle_request() or prepare_request(), it was still calling
      Apache::Request->new.  (reported by Ray Zimmerman)
    - Fixed incorrect $m->make_subrequest documentation.  (reported by Ray
      Zimmerman)
    - Added some incompatibilities in 1.10 to the UPGRADE document that
      were left out in previous versions.
    - HTML error output could be sent as plain text or some other content
      type depending on your Apache config and the file extension of the
      requested component.  Now we explicitly set $r->content_type before
      sending HTML error output.
    - Fix failures of Resolver::File::glob_path() with Win32.  (reported
      by Adam Reinhart)

1.10  June 25, 2002

      This is a big release and there are a number of backwards
      incompatibilities with version 1.05 and earlier.  Please make sure to
      read the UPGRADE document, which covers these in more detail.

    [ ENHANCEMENTS ]

    - Mason can always detect when an object file was compiled with an
      incompatible compiler/lexer, even if the object file contains syntax
      errors.
    - Method and subcomponent blocks with no name (<%method>) were caught
      as an error, but the error message was very confusing.  This has been
      fixed.
    - Added HTML::Mason::Subclassing, documentation on subclassing Mason
      objects.
    - Added documentation on the interaction between <%once> sections and
      preloading components.
    - Mason automatically calls $m->clear_buffer when $m->decline is
      called.

    [ BUG FIXES ]

    - Fixed a bug in the lexer that made it think it had found a Perl-line
      where none existed.
    - Fixed a bug related to handling of parameters in httpd.conf files.
      This was only noticeable if you attempted to provide a subclass of one
      of Mason's classes (like your own Request class) that took its own
      parameters.  Mason was not recognizing those additional parameters as
      valid.
    - Improved line number reporting from earlier releases.  Line numbers
      are now reported properly for errors in any type of block.

1.09_02  June 4, 2002

      longer resolved.  All component paths must be absolute.  Relative path
      resolution was added in 1.09_01 so this change is unlikely to affect
      most users.
    - ** Removed option to expire a component from the Apache::Status
      page.  This option made little sense since components are cached
      per-process, and there's no guarantee that any particular process has
      cached a given component.  Again, this is a feature added in 1.09_01
      so this change should not cause most people any problems.
    - ** Renamed CGIHandler's handle_cgi method to handle_comp.
    - ** Removed the dev_dirs feature from CGIHandler.
    - ** The default component root when not using ApacheHandler or
      CGIHandler is now the current working directory at the time the
      HTML::Mason::Resolver::File class is loaded.

    [ ENHANCEMENTS ]

    - All the modules included with Mason are now documented.
    - Various pieces of existing documentation have been tweaked and
      modified.
    - Added handle_cgi_object method to CGIHandler.
    - Mason works with the CVS version of mod_perl 2.0 when mod_perl 2.0's
      backwards compatibility layer is used.  AFAICT, the CVS version is
      close enough to what will be released as 2.0 that few, if any, changes
      should be required once 2.0 is out.
    - When running Mason with the ApacheHandler or CGIHandler modules, the
      Mason request object ($m) now has a "redirect" method, which can be
      used to send an HTTP redirect to the client.
    [ BUG FIXES ]

    - $m->flush_buffer was sending out '' to the buffer, even if no output
      existed.  This caused ApacheHandler to send headers, which broke
      redirects, for example.
    - Fix broken Apache::Status page  (reported by Thomas A. Lowery).
    - The lexing code now handles some weird edge case errors in a better
      way.  One of these involved a component starting with a invalid block
      name like <%foo>.
    - A component that compiles into Perl code that causes syntax errors
      seems to trigger a Perl bug when Mason attempts to eval it.  The
      symptom is that Mason simply hangs when it tries to eval the
      component's object file.  This bug is present in Perls before 5.7.3,
      but appears to be fixed in the development branch.  Mason will use
      alarm, if supported by the system, to work around this.
    - Output from subrequests was appearing _before_ other component
      output.  The new default is that this output appears "inline" in the
      calling component, which we think is most DWIM-ish.  Alternate
      behavior can be achieved by explicitly setting the subrequest's
      out_method parameter.
    - The $r object provided by CGIHandler.pm was not passing header
      values to CGI.pm in a way that CGI.pm liked.  Now we add a '-' to the
      front of the header name if necessary, and all headers are canonized
      to lower case in order to avoid having duplicates.
    - Mason only requires Apache::Request if you have mod_perl installed
      already.

1.09_01  April 4, 2002

    [ INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES ]

    - ** Errors now report line numbers from the component source file.
    - ** The Parser class has been removed entirely.  Its functionality
      has been split between the Lexer and Compiler objects.
    - ** The debug file feature has been removed.
    - ** The previewer has been removed.
    - ** The system log feature has been removed.
    - ** The Interp use_reload_files parameter has been removed.  The new
      static_source parameter provides a useful, and conceptually simpler,
      replacement.
    - ** Mason's built in caching now uses Cache::Cache to do all the
      heavy lifting.  This means that parameters for both the $m->cache and
      $m->cache_self methods have changed.
    - ** The ApacheHandler's top_level_predicate parameter has been
      removed.
    - ** The mc_* commands have been removed entirely.
    - ** The Interp's taint_check parameter has been removed.  Mason now
      simply determines whether or not it is running in taint mode and acts
      appropriately without user intervention.
    - ** Mason now uses Apache::Request as its default argument processing
      module.  You can explicitly use CGI.pm if you prefer.
    - ** The ApacheHandler module no longers accepts parameters when
      imported.  Instead, you specify this parameter via the ApacheHandler
      constructor.
    - ** The ApacheHandler module now requires a minimum of mod_perl 1.22.
    - ** The Component's run_count() and first_time() methods have been
      removed.
    - ** The HTML::Mason::Config module is no longer needed, and is no
      longer generated during the installation process.
    - ** The Interp's autohandler_name and dhandler_name params no longer take
      undef as a valid value.
    - ** The Interp's use_autohandlers, use_dhandlers, and
      allow_recursive_autohandlers parameters have all been removed.
    - ** The $m->top_args and $m->top_comp methods have been renamed to
      $m->request_args and $m->request_comp.  The old methods are deprecated
      but will work until the 1.20 release.
    - ** Passing an Interp object to the ApacheHandler constructor (as in
      a handler.pl file) will no longer work unless you set the Interp's
      resolver_class parameter to
      'HTML::Mason::Resolver::File::ApacheHandler'.  However, you can now
      pass Interp constructor params directly to the ApacheHandler
      constructor, which will create the interp object internally. 
    - ** The MasonMultipleConfig httpd.conf parameter has been removed.
      Mason can now figure this out by itself.
    - ** The HTML::Mason::Interp time() method has gone away.
    - ** The base_comp is now changed for each component call, unless that
      component call uses a component object for its first argument, or the
      call starts with SELF: or PARENT:.
    - ** The "perl_" prefix for Mason tags is no longer supported.
    - ** The backslash character now eliminates a newline at the end of
      any line, not just before %-lines and section tags.

    [ ENHANCEMENTS AND NEW FEATURES ]

    - It is now possible to pass chunks of component content as part of a
      component call.
    - Mason now supports subrequests via the new $m->subexec and
      $m->make_subrequest methods.
    - Mason no longer requires you to specify a component root or data
      directory.  The component root now defaults to your document root in a
      web context, or your filesystem root in a standalone context.  The
      data directory will be a subdirectory of your server root under
      mod_perl, and Mason can work without any data directory at all in
      other contexts.
    - The Resolver class API has been redesigned and is documented for the
      first time.
    - The installation process will offer to help you setup Mason for use
      with mod_perl if it can find your Apache configuration file and it
      cannot find an existing Mason configuration.
    - The HTML::Mason::Request->instance method is now the officially
      supported way of getting at the current request object outside of a
      Mason component (suggested by John Siracusa).
    - The HTML::Mason::Interp->comp_exists method now checks for a
      component's existence without loading the component (suggested by
      Randal Schwartz).
    - Mason now includes a module called HTML::Mason::CGIHandler, which
      greatly simplifies the use of Mason via CGI scripts.
    - Mason now uses File::Spec for all filesystem operations.
    - All the .pod files have been merged into their corresponding .pm
      files, where appropriate.
    - Added the Component attr_if_exists method (suggested by Joe
      Frisbie).
    - We now use the HTML::Entities module's encode function for the 'h'
      substitution escape flag.  This module escapes high-ascii characters
      properly.
    - Calling a method via $m->comp('comp:method') works just like
      $comp->call_method('method').
    - When an object contains other objects then the containing object's
      constructor accepts parameters intended for the contained objects.
      For example, the Interp object contains a Resolver object and Request
      objects.  The Interp's new method will accept constructor parameter
      for both the Resolver and Request objects.
    - The ApacheHandler args_method is now a per-object parameter.
    - Mason is now much smarter about recompiling components.  In general,
      it can detect if compiler options for a compiled component are
      different from the current options, and will recompile the component
      if necessary.  The exception to this is that with compiler parameters
      which take callbacks (such as preprocess), Mason can only tell if such
      a parameter is present, not whether the actual callback has changed.
    - The ApacheHandler object will chown any files created during server
      startup as needed.

    [ BUG FIXES ]

    - The <%args> section can now contain comments which contain the
      string '=>' (reported by Chris Hutchinson).
    - Fixed the longstanding bug that using print() or $r->print() causes
      output/headers to appear out of order.  You can now safely use these,
      though we still recommend that you use Mason to send output.
    - Filtered output now does appear when $m->abort() used.  However, an
      abort inside a component called via $m->scomp() still cause the output
      generated by that component to disappear.

    [ INTERNALS ]

    - Output buffering and filtering is handled by the new
      HTML::Mason::Buffer class.
    - All fatal errors thrown during component execution are exception
      objects in the HTML::Mason::Exception class hierarchy.
    - The CGI GET/POST argument processing code has been simplified
      (submitted by Ilmari Karonen).
    - ApacheHandler now uses a special Resolver subclass to translate URIs
      to component paths.
    - Parameters passed to "set" accessors are now validated in the same
      way as constructor parameters.
    - The component requested and the arguments it was passed are now
      properties of the Request object.

1.05  April 30, 2002

    - Fixed improper handling of parameters for non-GET/POST
      request. (submitted by Radu Greab)
    - Fixed Interp to accept a resolver object param. (reported by Bojan
      Jovanovic)
    - Fixed infinite loop when calling $m->decline with // in dhandler
      arg. (reported by Baldur Kristinsson)

1.04  October 30, 2001

    - Fixed locale parser_version 0,8 problem. (submitted by Louis-David Mitterrand) 
    - Fixed inability to use '/' for comp_root. (reported by Doug Hunt) 
    - Fixed HTML::Mason::Parser::make_dirs dying when reload_file not
      defined. (reported by Ivan E. Panchenko)
    - Made error_process regexps more specific. (suggested by Vadim Belman) 
    - Fixed $m->count. (reported by David Wheeler) 
    - Fixed writing of object files in taint mode. (submitted by Barrie Slaymaker) 
    - Made it possible to run Makefile.PL without prompts. 

1.03  May 17, 2001

    - Made raw error message accessible from the new error display via
      an unobtrusive link.
    - Fixed Apache tests when started by a non-root user. (reported
      by Barrie Slaymaker)
    - Added short-circuits for Apache tests on Win32 and on systems with
      Apache configurations that cannot be properly parsed. (reported by
      Jindra Vavruska)

1.02  April 17, 2001

    - Completely redesigned error display. The new display includes a
      contextual source listing and readable stacktrace. You can access the
      old error behavior with the raw_html and raw_fatal error modes.
      (implemented by Matthew Lewinski)
    - Fixed $m->file to close its filehandle between uses. (reported by
      Matthew Lewinski)
    - Fixed bad interaction with Mason 1.01 and CPAN module, by adding
      version number to ApacheHandler.pm.
    - Fixed $m->top_comp to work as documented, and made documentation
      a bit more explicit. (reported by Gordon Henriksen)
    - Fixed specification of a component root as "foo => /foo" in
      httpd.conf. (reported by Chuck O'Donnell)
    - Added MasonDeclineDirs, accidentally omitted in 1.01. (reported by
      David Wheeler)
    - Changed sql examples in Devel.pod to use bind variables. (suggested
      by Austin S. Lin)

1.015 April 3, 2001

    - Fixed incompatibility with mod_perl < 1.21_01, introduced in 1.01.
    - Added 'use Apache.pm' to ApacheHandler.pm, necessary for some
      mod_perl installations.

1.01  March 27, 2001

    - Implemented configuration of Mason from httpd.conf via PerlSetVar
      directives.  This removes the need for a handler.pl file in many
      cases.
    - Revamped ApacheHandler tests to use a real Apache web server and
      mod_perl (assuming this is installed).  This allows for much better
      testing of Mason.  However, the test suite takes a bit longer to run
      as starting and stopping the server can take a second or two each
      time.
    - ** Fixed handling of POST requests with query strings via CGI.pm;
      the query string arguments were previously ignored, and are now merged
      with POST arguments. This is an incompatible change only for those
      whose code relied on the arguments missing.
    - Added basic validation of arguments to Parser, Interp,
      and ApacheHandler constructors.
    - Added interp->die_handler, allowing you to install your own
      subroutine as $SIG{__DIE__} to catch errors during component
      execution.  Alternately, you can simply turn the special error
      handling off.
    - Added interp->use_dhandlers and interp->use_autohandlers, more
      intuitive ways to turn on/off dhandlers and autohandlers.
    - Eliminated interp->verbose_compile_error, which is no longer needed
      and has not worked for some time.
    - Wrapped each component call in eval, allowing us to simplify the
      request stack code.  No visible user change.
    - Documented that you cannot call return() from a <%shared> or <%once>
      section.  (reported by Paolo Campanella)
    - Fixed documentation of escaped newline behavior.
    - Fixed incorrect code for using mod_perl args method in
      eg/session_handler.pl.

1.0  January 31, 2001

    - Identical to 0.896 except for version.

0.896  January 5, 2001

    - Fixed bug preventing Mason from working with PerlFreshRestart.
    - Fixed use_reload_file to work as documented and not stat() source files. (submitted by Benjamin John Turner)
    - Fixed display in Apache::Status.
    - Documented the significance of ordering in <%args> sections.
    - Fixed documentation of %ARGS with regards to hashes passed in query string. (suggested by Adam Stubbs)
    - Added version # to 'use Apache::Session::File' in session_handler.pl.
    - Fixed preloads documentation to match reality.

0.895  December 11, 2000

    - ** Removed ApacheHandler from Mason.pm. It is now necessary to
      explicitly 'use' the HTML::Mason::ApacheHandler module in your
      handler.pl file (or elsewhere).  This fixes an intermittent
      args_method bug and cleans up Mason.pod.
    - ** Changed $m->caller_args to return a hash reference in scalar
      context and a list/hash in list context. Older calls expecting a list
      reference will need to be changed.
    - Fixed Mason to work under Perl's tainting mode again.  Thanks to John
      Tobey for pointing us in the right direction.
    - Modified the definition of "next component" to depend on the current
      component, not merely the number of times $m->call_next has been
      called.  This allows $m->fetch_next to work as documented. Also
      added $m->fetch_next_all, which returns the rest of the wrapper chain.
    - Fixed bug with ../.. in component paths.  Versions 0.88 and 0.89
      would create multiple object files for a single component and would
      allow any filename to be treated as an internal component.  This was
      _not_ exploitable externally via Apache, however.  (reported by Pascal
      Eeftinck)
    - Implemented $m->top_comp and $m->top_args, and fixed documentation
      for $m->callers(-1).  (suggested by Kees Vonk)
    - Added full line comments to <%args> sections. (suggested by Matthew
      Lewinski)
    - Revamped test harness system with HTML::Mason::Tests, greatly
      simplifying the new test creation process.
    - Implemented partial compliance with Apache::Filter; Mason can now be
      used as a pre-filter but not yet as a post-filter. i.e. Configurations
      like "PerlHandler HTML::Mason Apache::Compress" will work.
    - Implemented logging of NOT FOUND errors to match plain Apache. Also
      issue special warnings for Mason-specific causes of NOT FOUND.
    - Documented Mason request object's aborted and aborted_value methods.
    - Documented the fact that any variable declared in the <%args>
      section must be a valid Perl variable name.  The parser will now give
      an error if it encounters an invalid name (such as $foo.x).
    - Eliminated upgrade of Apache request object to Apache::Request class
      if this were done previously.  (submitted by Shevek)
    - Removed FAQ from distribution. Users should seek out the most
      current FAQ, now maintained by Kwindla Kramer, on the web.
    - Fixed bug where an attempt to escape a substitution that contained a
      function operating on a list (like sort or map) ended up appending the
      escape flag characters to the list being operated on.
    - Fixed the test 08-ah to work with CGI versions >= 3.0. (reported by
      Alexei V. Barantsev)
    - Fixed a problem with the parser when running with a locale that used
      a comma as the decimal separator instead of a period. (reported by
      Louis-David Mitterrand)
    - Clarified the 'u' escape flag in docs.
    - Removed use of $r->finfo in Apachehandler.pm, which causes random
      core dumps in certain versions of mod_perl.
    - Updated eg/session_handler.pl code to match Apache::Session 1.50+.
    - Fixed various problems with debug files.
    - Fixed a bug sometimes seen when the parser failed to parse a
      component called by another component.
    - Fixed a bug that prevented the $m->cache_self method from returning
      anything.
    - Fixed documentation regarding 'months' and 'years' units in
      expire_in cache flag.
    - Fixed bug in HTML/Mason/Component/Subcomponent.pm create_time
      method.  (reported by Caleb Crome)
    - Fixed bug where Mason would try to escape undefined values in a
      substitution with an escape flag.  (submitted by Denis Shaposhnikov)

0.89  September 14, 2000

    - Fixed broken CGI args implementation from 0.88 (old arguments
      appearing in new requests)
    - Fixed system log bug from 0.88

0.88  August 30, 2000

    - Fixed broken Parser postprocessor code (broken since 0.85).  Added
      tests for this code path as well as the preprocessor feature.
      (reported by Tim Bishop)
    - Replaced lots of simple accessors with new HTML::Mason::MethodMaker
      (which just makes simple read-only and read-write accessor methods).
    - Removed all direct hash key access from one object into another.
    - Removed all unneeded uses of Exporter in various modules.
    - Added warning about using mod_perl as a DSO to README file.
    - Added 'cgi_object' method to HTML::Mason::Request::ApacheHandler.
      This method returns the CGI object Mason uses internally (unless
      you're using Apache::Request instead in which case its a fatal error).
      Added documentation for this. (suggested by many people).
    - Squashed warning in assignment to %ARGS in component sub body.
    - Fixed call_method and scall_method to take arbitrary list of args
      instead of hash.
    - Fixed expression escape flags to allow arbitrary following
      whitespace.  (reported by Mikhail Zabaluev)
    - Added FAQ on how to handle file uploads.
    - $m->cache returns the value stored on a successful store action.
    - Reduced memory usage by removing unneeded uses of various modules.
      On my box I see about a 500k or so reduction in memory use (Dave).
    - Removed all uses of the IO::* modules.
    - Mason seems to be working under a mod_perl DSO, at least under
      mod_perl 1.24 and Apache 1.3.12.  This probably has nothing to do with
      Mason but the very adventurous are encouraged to experiment with a
      mod_perl DSO and report back to the mason list.

0.87  May 24, 2000

    - Fixed multiple GET/POST argument glitch introduced in 0.86.
      (reported by Matt Hoskins)

0.86  May 18, 2000

    - Fixed multiple-<%perl>-section infinite loop bug introduced in 0.85.
    - (Re-)Fixed Apache hang on POST not-found bug.
    - Added $m->scall_method, analagous to $m->scomp. (suggested by Michael Shulman)
    - When using mod_perl args method, $r is upgraded to Apache::Request object.
      (suggested by Matt Hoskins)
    - Documented attr, methods, and flags in Component.pod.
    - Improved error msg for <%def> or <%method> lacking name.
    - Improved error msg for using invalid embedded tag in def or
      method. (submitted by Dave Rolsky)
    - Eliminated reliance on hash ordering in tests.
    - Changed test scripts to create separate data dirs for each test
      branch and clear data dir at start of test.
    - Added mixed case and repeated sections to <%perl> tests.
    - ** Removed mod_perl specific $m->http_input; can no longer be
      supported.
    - Fixed args processing loop to allow multiple file
      uploads. (submitted by Matt Hoskins)

0.85  May 7, 2000

    - Added object-oriented primitives to components. Components can
      define methods and attributes and inherit from parent components.
      Templates can access the current page's methods and attributes for
      greater flexibility.
    - ** Major improvements/changes to autohandler feature. Autohandlers
      are now recursive by default, and all applicable autohandlers for a
      given page get a chance to run. If you have multiple autohandlers in
      parent/child directories, or if you used autohandlers with
      allow_recursive_autohandlers=0, you will need to adjust for the new
      policy.
    - Integrated a revamped parse_component that is cleaner, more modular
      and easier to subclass. Courtesy of Dave Rolsky.
    - New <%shared> section contains code that executes once per request
      and whose declarations are visible from the main component, methods
      and subcomponents alike.
    - Added escape flags for <% %> output. Can now HTML-escape or
      URI-escape expressions on a site-wide or per-expression
      basis.
    - Added choice of CGI or Apache::Request when using
      ApacheHandler. (submitted by Dave Rolsky)
    - Documented $m->clear_buffer, which removes all pending output from
      the buffer.
    - Fixed keys and expires cache actions from m->cache
      interface. (suggested by Matt Hoskins)
    - dhandlers can now serve their own directory; added documentation
      about handling directories.
    - Fixed dhandler bug introduced in 0.81 whereby $m->dhandler_arg only
      contains the first branch of a multi-branch argument.
    - Removed memory leak in ApacheHandler::handle_request_1. (submitted
      by Pascal Eeftinck and Renzo Toma)
    - Changed parent_comp() to owner() for subcomponents/methods.
    - Increased maximum recurse level from 16 to 32.
    - Reorganized syntax section of developer's manual and added a "how to
      use this manual" section.
    - Added an UPGRADE guide to distribution.
    - Added section about securing top-level components to Admin.pod.
      (suggested by Sean Cazzell)
    - Added section about declining image requests to Admin.pod.
    - Eliminated "Subroutine status_mason redefined" warning when creating
      multiple ApacheHandlers.
    - Updated cookie expiration in CD-ME example. (reported by Renzo Toma)
    - Added a "-f" flag to rm in faq Makefile. (reported by Jeremy Taylor)

0.81  February 20, 2000

    - Fixed small 0.8 bugs with automatic header sending. Headers are now
      sent for blank pages and are not sent on an error status code.
    - Fixed bug with default system log file. (submitted by Renzo Toma)
    - Eliminated memory leak introduced in 0.8 for a few Linux platforms.
      (submitted by Renzo Toma and Pascal Eeftinck)
    - Fixed bug with component paths displaying two leading slashes.
    - Fixed $comp->source_file when multiple comp roots declared.
    - Fixed $m->decline in mod_perl mode.
    - Removed legacy dhandler code from ApacheHandler.
    - Replaced $r->filename with $r->finfo in ApacheHandler.
      (submitted by Dennis Watson)
    - Added dynamic virtual server configuration example to Admin.pod.
      (submitted by Caleb Crome)

0.8  January 23, 2000

    - New integrated request API. $m replaces $REQ as the global variable
      containing the current request object. All mc_ commands have been
      incorporated into $m methods: mc_comp becomes $m->comp, mc_file
      becomes $m->file, etc. The old commands still work for now.
    - The utility bin/convert0.8.pl converts existing components to use
      the new request API.
    - Autohandler methods have been renamed: from mc_auto_next to
      $m->call_next and mc_auto_comp to $m->fetch_next. This is in
      preparation for a more general component inheritance system.
      convert0.8.pl handles this change.
    - Can now specify multiple component roots in the spirit of @INC.
      (suggested by Ewan Edwards and others)
    - Simplified HTTP header behavior. Headers are sent at the end of the
      request (in batch mode) or just before the first non-whitespace output
      (in stream mode). suppress_http_header no longer needed.
    - New organization of Component class into subclasses
      Component::FileBased and Component::Subcomponent. No outward change.
    - Updated object file format. Mason should generally auto-detect
      and recompile old object files, but may not catch everything. Try
      removing your object directory if errors persist.
    - ** mc_suppress_http_header command still exists but does nothing.
      In most cases this should not cause a problem. The only
      incompatibility is if you have used mc_suppress_http_header to
      suppress headers completely (i.e. you don't want Mason to send headers
      at all); in this case pass auto_send_headers=>0 to ApacheHandler.
    - Output mode parameter was moved from ah->output_mode to
      interp->out_mode, to make it independent of mod_perl.
      ah->output_mode still works.
    - New in-memory code cache keeps track of component usage, and
      discards the most infrequently used components as needed.  You can
      specify the cache size with interp->max_code_cache_size.
    - ** Eliminated the now unnecessary interp->code_cache_mode.
    - ** Eliminated the "source references" optimization, a common source of
      bugs, no longer needed with the new code cache.
    - Allow arguments to be accessed via @_ as in regular subroutines; no
      longer required to be in hash form. (suggested by Ken Williams)
    - Added $m->scomp, which returns the output of the component call
      instead of printing it. This is a cleaner replacement for the STORE
      parameter, which still works but is no longer officially documented.
    - Added $m->flush_buffer, which forces the buffer to be sent to the
      client when in batch mode.
    - Added $m->caller_args, which returns the argument list for any point
      in the stack. (suggested by Lee Semel)
    - Added $m->decline, which passes control to the next dhandler.
      (suggested by Chuck O'Donnell)
    - Augmented $m->cache_self to cache return values as well as output.
      (suggested by Jon Frisby)
    - Changed data cache filenames from colon-separated to url-encode
      style for Win32 compatibility. (submitted by Ken Williams)
    - Added improved, separate session_handler.pl for session handling.
    - ** mc_comp_source no longer works for non-existent components.
    - ** Removed mc_date legacy command.
    - Many new test scripts.
    - Added warnings about using Mason with mod_perl DSO.
    - Added more site configuration examples to Admin.pod.
    - Split object parameter methods (interp->comp_root, etc.) into
      read/write and read-only as appropriate.
    - Fixed request stack corruption when die() or error from one
      component is caught by another component's eval.
    - Fixed doc_root / comp_root mismatch on case-insensitive O/S.
      (reported by John Arnold)
    - Fixed "directory not absolute" warning on "/" (reported by Joe Edmonds)
    - Fixed reload file scanning mechanism (submitted by Brian Holmes)
    - Added use_data_dumper_xs Config.pm item, which checks whether
      Data::Dumper::Dumpxs is available. (reported by Pelle Johnsen)
    - Added "code examples" section to README

0.72  October 15, 1999

    - Eliminated long-standing infinite-block bug when POSTing to a
      non-existent URL
    - Fixed "keys" cache action which never worked as documented
      (submitted by Scott Straley)
    - Fixed source references on Win32 platforms by using text mode when
      reading object file (submitted by Michael Shulman)
    - Fixed various methods in FakeApache
    - Remove final slash from system paths (component root, etc.) and
      check that those paths are absolute
    - Fixed all-text subcomponents, by bypassing the pure-text
      optimization
    - Quoted all hash strings in object file to reduce "Ambiguous use
      of ..." warnings (suggested by Paul Schilling)
    - Replaced */* with default-handler as recommended way to bypass Mason
      (suggested by Dirk Koopman)
    - Removed defunct pure text section in Administrators Guide (reported
      by Michael Shulman)

0.71  September 14, 1999

    - Logic of top_level_predicate was reversed in 0.7; fixed.
      (reported by Tom Hughes, Eric Hammond)
    - mc_suppress_http_header(0) was broken in 0.7; fixed.
      (reported by Michael Alan Dorman)
    - Fixed bug in parser section that determines whether % is at the
      beginning of a line.  (reported by Tom Hughes)
    - Parser no longer inadvertently accepts argument names with
      whitespace.  (reported by Phillip Gwyn)

0.7  September 1, 1999

    - Improved core implementation with two new classes,
      HTML::Mason::Request and HTML::Mason::Component.  Code is now cleaner
      and more scalable, and the new APIs give developers control and
      introspection over Mason's inner workings.
    - Added documentation to accommodate new classes: created
      Request.pod and Component.pod, and moved component developer's guide
      (previously at Components.pod) to Devel.pod to avoid
      confusion.
    - Object files have changed significantly (they now return a
      component object).  Pre-0.7 object files will be detected and
      automatically updated, unless you are running in reload file mode
      in which case you are responsible for generating new object files.
    - New <%def> section defines a subcomponent embedded inside a larger
      component.  This allows repeated code and HTML to be modularized
      without affecting the global component namespace.
    - <%args> section now accommodates optional comments for declarations
    - Improved Perl translation of <%args> section (submitted by Ken
      Williams)
    - Autohandler and dhandler file names are now configurable
    - Dhandlers, which formerly worked only in mod_perl mode, now work in
      stand-alone mode as well
    - Interp::exec is now re-entrant with all request specific information
      having been moved to Request class.
    - ** Reworked Parser API. parse is now called make_component, has a
      simplified set of options, and returns a component object
      directly. make is now called make_dirs.
    - Source references now read from the object file, cleaner for a
      variety of reasons. Preprocess and postprocess now work with source
      references.
    - Removed obsolete and undocumented Interp::vars and mc_var functions
    - Simplified chown/getpwuid usage in handler.pl (submitted by Randal
      Schwartz)

0.6.2  August 20, 1999

    - Fixed problem with shared data cache locks over NFS (submitted by
      Tom Hughes)
    - Fixed mc_auto_comp, which never really worked as documented
    - Fixed preloading for directories (submitted by Dennis Watson)
    - Added back Utils::get_lock, which is used by content management

0.6.1  July 27, 1999

    - Added warnings to convert-0.6.pl about occasional erroneous
      component call syntax conversions (reported by Oleg Bartunov)
    - Fixed conversion of <% mc_comp("/foo/$bar") %> (reported by Oleg
      Bartunov)
    - Fixed cache access under high concurrencies (reported by Oleg
      Bartunov)
    - Fixed uppercase <%PERL>, broken in 0.6 (reported by Daniel L. Jones)
    - Fixed mc_suppress_http_header(0), broken in 0.6 (reported by Jim
      Mortko)

0.6  July 16, 1999

    - New <& &> tag provides a more convenient way to call components
      inside HTML. mc_comp still works.
    - The "perl_" prefix has been eliminated from section names: now
      simply use <%init>, <%cleanup>, <%args>, etc. The old names still
      work.
    - The utility bin/convert0.6.pl converts existing components to use
      the above new syntax.
    - New autohandler feature finally provides an easy way to specify a
      common template or behavior for a directory. An autohandler is invoked
      just before any top-level components in its directory begins executing.
      It can display header/footers, apply a filtering function, set up
      globals, etc.  A good complement to dhandlers.
    - New <%once> section contains code that will be executed once when a
      component is loaded.  It is useful for defining persistent variables
      and named subroutines.
    - New <%filter> section and mc_call_self command allow you to arbitrarily
      filter the output of the current component.
    - New <%text> section allows you to turn off Mason processing for a
      particular section of text.
    - Implemented first installation test suite! [modus]
    - HEAD optimization: we now automatically abort after headers are sent
      on a HEAD request.
    - New Parser make() utility traverses a tree of components, compiling
      any out-of-date components into object files and reporting errors.
    - New mc_comp_source command returns the source filename of this or
      any component.
    - mc_file now uses current component path by default for relative paths
      if no static_file_root defined (suggested by John Landahl)
    - Various previewer interface improvements
    - Removed link tags in pods documentation due to 5.004 problems
    - Took out previewer stub from Mason.pm to eliminate "subroutine
      redefined" warning
    - Updated makeconfig.pl to prefer GDBM_File, to avoid a bug in
      Berkeley DB 1.x
    - Cleaned and sped up interp hooks facility
    - Stopped substituting control characters for section strings in Parser
      [modus]
    - Fixed mc_cache 'expire' bug (reported by Aaron Ross)
    - Changed ignore_warnings default to ignore "subroutine redefined"
      warnings to make <%once> more useful
    - Removed defunct Safe code from Parser and defunct ALLOW_HANDLERS
      code from Interp
    - Added index file to htdocs/

0.5.1  June 10, 1999
    - Removed leftover "use File::Recurse" in ApacheHandler.pm [modus]
    - Added empty test target to FAQ Makefile, required on certain
      architectures [modus]

0.5   June 3, 1999
    - Removed memory leak associated with "return sub { ... }"
    - Overhauled Config.pm, now maintains previous configuration when
      upgrading Mason (suggested by Patrick Kane)
    - Made filename processing compatible with Windows 32 (suggested by
      Rafael Weinstein)
    - Removed requirement of File::Tools/File::Recurse, replaced with
      standard File::Find
    - Switched output to STDOUT from $r->print, to facilitate chaining
      with other mod_perl tools
    - Switched to standard argument processing code, now handles
      multi-part forms [modus]
    - New preprocess and postprocess Parser options allow you to apply
      auomatic modifications to components, before or after they are compiled
      into code. (submitted by Philip Gwyn)
    - New in_package Parser option allows components to live in any
      package. (submitted by Philip Gwyn)
    - Added documentation about using globals in components, and
      some new facilities: Parser option 'allow_globals' and Interp
      method 'set_global'.
    - Documented how to save persistent user information with Apache::Session [modus]
    - ** Changed behavior of reload_file mode to read directly from object
      files. If you use reload files, you're now responsible for
      creating object files. [mschmick]
    - Reduced number of file stats when loading components [mschmick]
    - New apache_status_title ApacheHandler option makes it possible to
      use Mason's perl-status page with multiple ApacheHandler objects.
      (submitted by Philip Gwyn)
    - Upgraded FakeApache/debug files to work with mod_perl 1.19
    - New sections in Component Developer's Guide explain how debug files
      work and some caveats about when they don't.
    - Mentioned mailing lists, masonhq.com web site, and FAQ in the
      documentation and README
    - Improved documentation on how to integrate images and non-Mason
      hierarchies with Mason.
    - Differentiated mc_cache and mc_cache_self in the commands manual
      (suggested by Tom Hukins)
    - Increased discouraging of SDBM, improved warnings when cache store
      fails (suggested by Patrick Kane)
    - Fixed HTML documentation to work with IE (suggested by Fen Lebalme)
    - Fixed infinite loop in ApacheHandler dhandler search (submitted by
      Chuck O'Donnell)
    - Documented Parser method parse(), which allows you to compile
      components outside of a Interp environment.
    - New mc_cache actions 'expire' and 'keys' help you peer into data cache
      files and expire selected keys.
    - Corrected Parser to properly handle \ in components (submitted by
      Ken Williams)
    - ** Took Preview out of Mason.pm; ApacheHandler used only if mod_perl
      environment. If you use the previewer, you now have to explicitly "use
      HTML::Mason::Preview" in your handler.pl.
    - Improved documentation about argument/GET/POST handling (suggested
      by Ken Williams)
    - Added cache option 'busy_lock', which prevents multiple processes
      from recomputing an expire cache value at the same time.  (suggested
      by Dennis Watson)
    - Inserted work-around for Perl 5.005 $r scoping bug (submitted by
      Rafael Weinstein)
    - Fixed "new CGI" example in Components.pod (submitted by Austin Lin)
    - Fixed "return if content-type..." line in handler.pl and Mason.pod
      (submitted by Patrick Kane)
    - Added CREDITS file

0.4  January 06, 1999
    - Added support for using Perl profiler in conjunction with debug
      files
    - Fixed bug in previewer HTML trace introduced in 0.3
    - Created Perl status section for Mason
    - Removed most warnings when PerlWarn is on (suggested by Philip Gwyn)
    - Added code_cache_mode parameter to control caching of components in
      memory
    - Fixed mismatch between documentation and code with regards to cache
      store events in system log.  The real event name is CACHE_WRITE.
    - Changed system logging to use canonical server name when recording
      URI
    - Field access methods inside Mason objects are now handled with
      custom subroutines instead of generic AUTOLOAD, improving performance
    - Information for debug file is no longer collected if debug mode is
      "none"
    - Code to decline images and other non-text requests was placed in
      default handler.pl and described in documentation (suggested by
      Patrick Kane)
    - Fixed server header output from debug files (suggested by Ewan Edwards)
    - Created a Mason bundle
    - Created a CPAN "alias" from Apache::Mason to HTML::Mason

0.3   November 25, 1998
    - Added optional system logging of page requests, cache activity,
      component loading
    - Deny directory requests so that index files will work in mod_perl 1.16+
    - Removed reliance on several external packages (Date::Manip,
      CGI::Base, URI::Escape). This should reduce the amount of memory taken
      up by Mason processes and make Mason easier to install.
    - ** Due to the removal of Date::Manip, the mc_date command will no
      longer work unless Date::Manip is explicitly used, and the syntax for
      the expire_at cache parameter and the Interp current_time parameter
      have changed.
    - Added parser taint_check flag which allows Mason to work with taint
      checking on (suggested by Randal Schwartz)
    - Added warning messages when returning 404 from ApacheHandler
    - Improved cache locking with the use of separate lock files
    - Makefile.PL checks for required and optional packages
    - Documentation fixes and improvements
    - Removed obsolete and undocumented commands from Commands.pm
    - Failure to write debug file is now a warning rather than fatal error
    - Augmented "no configuration for previewer port" error
    - Fixed $interp->exec to be able to return list
    - Changed parser to remove ctrl-Ms instead of replacing with spaces
    - Always call http_header hook, not just at top level
    - Added global IN_DEBUG_FILE flag
    - Renamed mc_call_stack to mc_comp_stack to match documentation

0.2   August 21, 1998
    - Replaced File::lockf module, which could not port to some systems,
      with simple call to flock
    - Corrected email address in README
    - Fixed undeclared variable bug in preview component
    - The previewer did not work in basic versions of Perl 5.004 due to an
      eval scoping bug. A workaround was put in place.
    - Fixed expire_if cache option to pass correct argument to provided
      subroutine
    - Empty argument section no longer parsing incorrectly
    - Took out directory names from manifest which were causing errors on
      install
    - Debug file is no longer prepared when debug_mode is "none"
    - Use Preview.pm in Mason.pm

0.1   July 22, 1998
    - Original version; created by h2xs 1.18
