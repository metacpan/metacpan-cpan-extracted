=head1 INSTRUCTIONS

The documentation is pretty light on this, sorry.  I think most things in the
editor are pretty self explanatory if you mess around with it.  There are a few
things I should explain though.

The editor supports three types of tiles: walls, corridors and rooms.  Each tile
has four "closures" (north, east, south, and west).

There are three types of closures: walls, openings, and doors.  The doors have
various settings as well.

The only other thing that you need to know is that room tiles are special and
are linked to their group-mates.  They cannot be modified unless they're
converted to corridor tiles -- although their closures can be modified.
