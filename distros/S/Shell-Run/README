Shell::Bash

This module provides an interface to the bash shell (or any other
interpreter) in addition to "system()", "qx{}", "open CMD, '|-', 'cmd'"
or "open CMD, '-|', 'cmd'".
While the first two offer no way to specify the command interpreter,
the last two don't allow to pipe data from and to the command at the
same time.

Shell::Bash tries to fill this gap as it uses (by default) "/bin/bash"
as the command interpreter and permits feeding input and capturing
output to/from the given command in variables simultaneously.
Furthermore it provides an easy way to set environment variables that
may be referred to as shell variables within the called command.
