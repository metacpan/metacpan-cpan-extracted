        - Prepared for SWISH-E 2.2.  Namely, made the results
          callback method ($hit->property) use the (at this time)
          standard names for the fields, and provide access to all
          data (swish internal data such as rank, title, file name, and
          properties) through method calls on the $hit object.

        - More works toward use with SWISH-E 2.2.
          New method $result->get_header that replaces the
          $result->indexheaders method.  The headers are now
          stored as a hash with a key INDEX that points to
          a hash of headers by index file name.
