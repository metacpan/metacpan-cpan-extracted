0.21 2015-02-08

- No code changes from 0.20.


0.20 2015-01-01 (TRIAL RELEASE)

[BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBILITIES]

- The errors thrown by this module when a type constraint fails have
  changed. They are now instances of the
  MooseX::Params::Validate::Exception::ValidationFailedForTypeConstraint
  class. When stringified, this class include the message generated by the
  failing type constraint. While similar to the error message thrown by
  Params::Validate itself, this message does not match that string exactly,
  and may break code that relies on a regex against the error message. This
  addresses RT #89378, requested by several people.


0.19 2014-11-08

- Added support for the depends parameter. RT #98685. (Hans Staugaard)


0.18 2013-01-16

- Fix broken prereq specification in 0.17. Reported by Justin Hunter.


0.17 2013-01-16

- Fix tests that broke with new hash randomization in 5.17.6. (Dagfinn Ilmari
  Mannsåker)


0.16 2011-01-29

- The validated_list and validated_hash functions now accept the values to be
  validated as both a hash and a hash reference.


0.15 2010-11-29

- Add MX_PARAMS_VALIDATE_ALLOW_EXTRA which allows extra parameters in
  validation calls (like allow_extra for Params::Validate).

- Converted to Test::Fatal.


0.14 2010-03-18

- The validated_hash method failed when called on in an overloaded stringify
  method. Patch by Ian Sillitoe. RT #52565.


0.13 2009-11-29

- Fix so that validated_hash does not try to coerce optional parameters which
  are not present. Patch by Ian Sillitoe.

- Same fix for pos_validated_list. (Dave Rolsky)


0.12 2009-07-07

- Using the subroutine name as a cache key for validation specs broke in the
  face of method modifiers, which all appear to have the same name. Now we use
  Devel::Caller to get the CV of the caller and use its refaddr as the key,
  which will be unique in all cases. Bug report by Jos Boumans. RT #46730.


0.11 2009-07-07

- The validation functions tried to coerce optional keys which weren't present
  in the incoming parameters, leading to weird errors. Based on a patch from
  Jos Boumans. RT #46344.

- Allow other callbacks to be specified. Previously these were silently thrown
  out. But we'd recommend just defining types that encapsulate everything in
  the callback instead. Based on a patch from Jos Boumans. RT #47647.


0.10 2009-06-30

- Shut up deprecation warnings from the tests. Reported by John Goulah.


0.09 2009-02-01

- The subroutine name being reported in error messages was screwy.


0.08 2009-02-01

- Renamed validate to validated_hash and validatep to validated_list. The old
  function names are still available under the ":deprecated" import tag.

- Added a new pos_validated_list which can validate position parameters.

- Errors now reflect the subroutine that called the validation function,
  rather than coming form inside the validation function itself.


0.07 2008-09-21

- No code changes, just fixing missing prereqs (Dave Rolsky)


0.06 2008-09-20

- Fixes to work with Moose 0.58 (Dave Rolsky)

- Switched to using Module::Install (Dave Rolsky)


0.05 2008-03-07

- This package would cause a fatal error if loaded by a non-Moose class (Dave
  Rolsky)

- Added support for coercions (Dave Rolsky)


0.04 2008-01-08

- upped the Moose dependency and added support for the new improved Moose type
  constraints

- adding caching of the prepared parameter specs, this results in approx. 3x
  speedup using rough benchmarks.

- added special caching handlers see the IMPORTANT NOTE ON CACHING section of
  the POD for more details


0.03 2007-06-08

- added support for using this within role methods too.


0.02 2007-04-25

- added validatep, which returns the captured args as positional instead of as
  hash


0.01 2007-04-18

- trying to fill a gap, we will see ...
