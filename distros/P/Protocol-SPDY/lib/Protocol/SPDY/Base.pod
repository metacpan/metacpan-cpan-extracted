=head1 NAME

Protocol::SPDY::Base - abstract support for the SPDY protocol

=head1 VERSION

version 1.001

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Provides the base class for client, server and generic (proxy/analysis)
SPDY handling.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new

Instantiates a new SPDY-handling object. Applies any attributes
passed as named parameters.

=head2 sender_zlib

The compression instance used for sending data.

=head2 receiver_zlib

Compression instance used for receiving (decompressing) data.

=head2 request_close

Issue a close request by sending a GOAWAY message.

=head2 restore_initial_settings

Send back the list of settings we'd previously persisted.

Typically called immediately after establishing the connection.

=head2 send_settings

Sends a SETTINGS frame generated from the key/value pairs passed
to this method.

Typically called immediately after establishing the connection.

Example:

 $spdy->send_settings(
   initial_window_size    => 32768,
   max_concurrent_streams => 16,
 );

=head2 check_version

Called before we do anything with a control frame.

Returns true if it's supported, false if not.

=head2 next_stream_id

Generate the next stream ID for this connection.

Returns the next available stream ID, or 0 if we're out of available streams

=head2 queue_frame

Requests sending the given C< $frame > at the earliest opportunity.

=head2 on_read

This is the method that an external transport would call when it has
some data received from the other side of the SPDY connection. It
expects to be called with a scalar containing bytes which can be
decoded as SPDY frames; any SSL/TLS decoding should happen before
passing data to this method.

Will call L</dispatch_frame> for any valid frames that can be
extracted from the stream.

=head2 prioritise_incoming_frames

Given a list of L<Protocol::SPDY::Frame> instances, returns them
reordered so that higher-priority items such as PING are handled
first.

Does not yet support stream priority.

=head2 dispatch_frame

Dispatches the given frame to appropriate handlers - this will
be the matching L<Protocol::SPDY::Stream> if one exists, or
internal connection state handling for GOAWAY/SETTINGS frames.

=head2 dispatch_unhandled_frame

Called when we receive a frame that's not been picked up by the
usual handlers - could be a SYN_REPLY on a stream that we don't
have, for example.

=head2 incoming_stream

Called when a new SYN_STREAM frame is received.

=head2 related_stream

Returns the L<Protocol::SPDY::Stream> matching the stream_id
for this frame (if it has one).

Will return undef if we have no stream yet or this frame
does not have a stream_id.

=head2 apply_settings

Applies the given settings to our internal state.

=head2 extract_frame

Given a scalar reference to a byte buffer, this will extract the first frame if possible
and return the bytes if it succeeded, undef if not. No frame validation is performed: the
bytes are extracted based on the length information only.

=head2 parse_frame

Parse a frame extracted by L</extract_frame>. Returns an appropriate subclass of L<Protocol::SPDY::Frame>
if this succeeded, dies if it fails.

=head2 goaway

Requests termination of the connection.

=head2 ping

Sends a ping request. We should get a PING packet back as a high-priority reply.

=head2 settings

Send settings to the remote.

=head2 credential

Sends credential information to the remote.

=head2 version

Returns the version supported by this instance. Currently, this is
always 3.

=head2 last_stream_id

The ID for the last stream we created.

=head2 write

Calls the external code which is expected to handle writes.

=head2 create_stream

Instantiate a new stream, returning the L<Protocol::SPDY::Stream> instance.

=head2 pending_send

Returns a count of the frames that are waiting to be sent.

=head2 has_stream

Returns true if we have a stream matching the ID on the
provided L<Protocol::SPDY::Stream> instance.

=head2 stream_by_id

Returns the L<Protocol::SPDY::Stream> matching the given ID.

=head2 expected_upload_bandwidth

The expected rate (kilobyte/sec) we can send data to the other side.

=head2 expected_download_bandwidth

The rate (kilobyte/sec) we expect to be able to receive data from the other side.

=head2 expected_round_trip_time

The rate (kilobyte/sec) we expect to be able to receive data from the other side.

=head2 max_concurrent_streams

The rate (kilobyte/sec) we expect to be able to receive data from the other side.

=head2 current_cwnd

The rate (kilobyte/sec) we expect to be able to receive data from the other side.

=head2 download_retrans_rate

The rate (kilobyte/sec) we expect to be able to receive data from the other side.

=head2 initial_window_size

The rate (kilobyte/sec) we expect to be able to receive data from the other side.

=head2 client_certificate_vector_size

The rate (kilobyte/sec) we expect to be able to receive data from the other side.

=head1 METHODS - Futures

=head2 batch

Future representing the current batch of frames being processed. Used
for deferring window updates.

=head1 EVENTS

The following events may be raised by this class - use
L<Mixin::Event::Dispatch/subscribe_to_event> to watch for them:

 $spdy->subscribe_to_event(
   send_frame => sub {
     my ($ev, $frame) = @_;
	 print "Send: $frame\n";
	 $ev->unsubscribe if $frame->type_name eq 'GOAWAY';
   }
 );

=head2 send_frame event

Called with the L<Protocol::SPDY::Frame> instance just before we attempt to send
a frame to the other side.

=head2 receive_frame event

Called with the L<Protocol::SPDY::Frame> instance just before we attempt to process
a frame received from the other side.

=head2 ping event

Called when we have received a PING request, just before we send back the reply.

=head2 stream event

Called after we have created a new stream in response to an incoming packet.

=head2 setting event

Called for each new SETTINGS entry received from the other side, just before
we have applied the value locally.
