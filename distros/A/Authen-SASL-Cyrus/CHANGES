History of updates to Authen::SASL::Cyrus

0.13
Updated the WRITE() method to use syswrite() and account for
variable buffer sizes in SASL.

0.12
Made Cyrus.xs more compatible with Perl API by changing function calls
like Perl_warn() to just warn(), and defining PERL_NO_GET_CONTEXT.
Made SASL properties which take an IP address and load it into the SASL
library more robust by determining if the passed address is in
"struct sockaddr" format or in "IP1.IP2.IP3.IP4;PORT" format.
Fixed passing of "function + params" as a callback. 

0.11
Fixed t/callback.t to NOT try connecting to the LDAP server
on localhost since that, well, doesn't work at Pause.

0.10
Added better callback management, Perl memory management,
and three test scripts, as written by Ulrich Pfeifer.

0.09
Changed securesocket GLOB, as suggested by Marius Tomaschewski.
Extended SASL2 support.

0.08
Changed the "code" routine to return the result code of the
last SASL library call. This allows differentiation of the
result of the client_step returning a zero byte string vs.
it saying authentication is complete.

0.07
Memcpy fix provided by Maurice Massar

0.06
Added SASL V2 support patch provided by Leif Johansson.

0.05
Added the SASL_CB_PASS callback. This callback, unfortunately, does
not put the caller's "context" as the first parameter to the callback
function. This means that the PerlCallback() function has to be able
to determine if the _perlcontext is the first parameter or the second.
Added a magic number as the first field of the _perlcontext struct
to help PerlCallback() decide which parameter is the perl context.

0.04
Added a method "securesocket" that takes a file handle and returns a
new file handle that is tied to the Security subclass added in 0.03. 
In this way, a client program can take the object returned from
client_new() and call the securesocket() method on it, passing in the
client's file handle, without ever having to know about the Security
subclass.  Also added a "tiehandle" method which will take the same
file handle as "securesocket", and tie it directly to the Security
subclass. The difference being "securesocket" returns a new file handle,
and "tiehandle" ties the handle passed in.

0.03  
Added encryption layer. Cyrus.xs now has encode() and decode()
methods. Added a "Security" subclass that can be used to tie a
filehandle to perform encryption on write() and decryption on read().
The new() method ties a passed in glob to the class.

0.02
Encryption layer not ready yet, so changed the "secflag" param in the
call to sasl_client_new() from 1 to 0.  Otherwise, the server will
start expecting encrypted requests and sending encrypted responses
after the authentication, and the client cannot encrypt/decrypt.

0.01
Initial release
