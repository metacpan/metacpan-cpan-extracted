NAME

    Hook::Output::Tiny - Easily enable/disable trapping of STDOUT/STDERR

SYNOPSIS

        use Hook::Output::Tiny;
    
        my $output = Hook::Output::Tiny->new;
    
        # trap either
    
        $output->hook('stdout');
        my @out = $output->stdout;
    
        $output->hook('stderr');
        my @err = $output->stderr;
    
        # untrap either
    
        $output->unhook('stdout');
        $output->unhook('stderr');
    
        # trap/untrap both simultaneously
    
        $output->hook;
        $output->unhook;
    
        # delete all entries from both (can specify individually)
    
        $output->flush;
    
        # append to a file (can specify individually)
    
        $output->write('file.txt');

DESCRIPTION

    Extremely lightweight mechanism for trapping STDOUT, STDERR or both.

    We save the captured output internally, so on long running
    applications, memory usage may become an issue if you don't flush() out
    or write() out the data.

    There are many modules that perform this task. I wrote this one for
    fun, and to be as small and as simple as possible.

METHODS

 new

    Returns a new Hook::Output::Tiny instance.

 hook

    You can send in either 'stdout' or 'stderr' and we'll trap that data.

    If you don't specify an option, we'll trap both (the data remains
    separated).

 unhook

    Send in either 'stdout' or 'stderr'. If not specified, we'll untrap
    both.

 stdout

    Returns a list of all the STDOUT entries that have been trapped.

 stderr

    Returns a list of all the STDERR entries that have been trapped.

 write($filename, $handle)

    Writes to $filename the entries in $handle, where $handle is either
    stdout or stderr. If no $handle is specified, we'll write out both
    handles to the same file.

    We then flush() (ie. delete) the respective handle data until the next
    write() or flush().

 flush

    Deletes all data for the handles. Send in either 'stdout' or 'stderr'
    to specify which to delete, otherwise we'll delete both.

EXAMPLE

    Testing scenario...

        use Foo::Bar;
        use Hook::Output::Tiny;
        use Test::More;
    
        my $output = Hook::Output::Tiny->new;
        my $thing = Foo::Bar->new;
    
        $output->hook;
    
        $thing->do;
    
        $output->unhook;
    
        is ($thing->do(), 1, "thing() ok");
        is ($output->stdout, 2, "got expected STDOUT");
        is ($output->stderr, 0, "got no STDERR");
    
        my @stdout = $output->stdout;
    
        like ($stdout[0], qr/do() called/, "STDOUT ok");
        is ($stdout[1], 'did', "STDOUT said do() 'did'");
    
        $output->hook;
    
        $thing->error;
    
        $output->unhook;
    
        @stderr = $output->stderr;
    
        like ($stderr[0], qr/error/, "error() errored properly");
