Revision history for overload::open

1.02.0 Jan 13, 2020
    - Add an option to suppress warnings. For now this is only
      applying to an internal error (so as long as you setup overload::open
      properly you should probably not get a warning

1.01.0 Jan 13, 2020
    - Use ssize_t instead of I32 when doing pointer math
    - If number of items is negative, don't attempt to PUSHMARK, just
      warn and don't try to do the prehook

    - Add provides to META and some code cleanup
