DESCRIPTION

This is a DateTime implementation of the Shire Calendar as described in
The Lord of the Rings by J. R. R. Tolkien. It is a follow-on to the
Date::Tolkien::Shire module.

The Shire Calendar is a rationalized calendar consisting of 12 months of
30 days each, plus 5 holidays (6 in leap years) that are not part of any
month. One of the holidays (two in leap years) are also not part of any
week. This causes every year to start on the same day of the week.

INSTALLATION

This pure-Perl module is installable using any of the usual
incantations.
