  - Fixed a nasty bug in the RecentChanges plugin
  - added two wiki maintenance tools :
      - dump-wiki.pl - creates nodeballs

0.08 20030401
  - Second cleanup release :
  - Fixed unquoted prerequisites in Makefile.PL (Perl 5.8.0 complains)

  - RecentChanges plugin now actually works
  - The scripts in bin/ are now checked whether they actually compile
  - Massive thanks to Kate L. Pugh and Podmaster who tested the previous
    release and reported all those nasty errors that either slipped
    my test setup or I didn't have tests for, or were simply neglected
    by me.
