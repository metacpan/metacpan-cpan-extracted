Version 0.51
February 19, 2007
----------------
	- Makefile reporting dependencies in CPAN-compatible way
	- added basic test suite
	- minor fixes
Version 0.50
July 14, 2006
----------------
	- a major bug in storing language tags and datatypes for
	  literals fixed (bug 3148, thanks to Pierluigi Miraglia and
	  Gregory Williams), it affects all types of storages (Memory,
	  DB_File, Postgres). The new version is NOT compatible with old
	  storages, so you will have to serialize your data, create new
	  storages and parse it back.
Version 0.40
March 2, 2006
----------------
	- some code cleanup (thanks to Gregory Williams)
	- a new method equals() added to literal object, datatype 
	  and laguage tag are taken into account (bug 2306)
	- escaping characters in rdf:about attribute fixed (bug 1630, 
	  thanks to Norman Walsh)
	- rdf:nodeID is produced by serializer when necessary, instead
	  of incorrect deanonymizing resource
Version 0.31
August 11, 2004
----------------
        - Typo in RDF::Core::NodeFactory fixed
	- RDF::Core::Model::Serializer callback functions can be
	  overriden now
Version 0.30
March 14, 2003
----------------
	Specification changes:
	- datatype and language information are handled wherever
	  needed (parser, serializer, storages, literal object, 
	  NTriples output)	
	- RDF/XML: rdf:nodeID attribute is handled in parser 
	- RDF/XML: rdf:parseType="Literal" asserts typed literal 
	- RDF/XML: rdf:parseType="Collection" attribute value is
	  handled

	Fixed bugs:
	- rdf namespace is prepended to about attribute in serializer
	- Namespace/local value separation is kept where
	  RDF::Core::Resource->clone() is called. (reported by Dan Berrios)  
Version 0.20
October 14, 2002
----------------
	- several bugs fixed
        - external variables binding supported in query 
          (prepare() and execute() methods)
        - comments are allowed in query syntax
	- query language syntax changes for (hopefully) better 
	  readability

Version 0.16
May 27, 2002
----------------
	- a second variable binding is added to query language (binds 
	  variable to property itself instead of property value)
	- member() - of container - function added to query language 
	  functions
	- a method "equals" is added to RDF::Core::Resource
	- a new module Schema is added, which provides access to RDF 
	  Schema
	- query tokenizer bug corrected (bug 854)

Version 0.15
April 16, 2002
----------------
	- parser recognizes and handles xml:base attribute (bug 771)
	- parser bug with rdf:bagID fixed (bug 774)
	- parser bug with rdf:li fixed (bug 776)
	- query results are not returned in array of rows, a callback 
	  function is called for each row instead
	- query evaluation speed was improved by applying conditions 
	  as soon as possible
	- DB_File storage handles SIGINT to protect data consistency
	- DB_File storage has a new option Sync which says how often
	  it should synchronize cache with disk
