NAME

Test::Builder::SubtestSelection - Select subtests by name or by number

DESCRIPTION

This subclass of the "Test::Builder" class allows you to select subtests by
name or by number before running them. In your test script you have to use the

"prove" runs your test script and the subtest selection is based on the value
given to the "--subtest" option.
