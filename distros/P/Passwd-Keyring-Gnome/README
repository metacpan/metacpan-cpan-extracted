VERSION

    Version 0.3003

SYNOPSIS

    Gnome Keyring based implementation of Keyring. Provide secure storage
    for passwords and similar sensitive data.

        use Passwd::Keyring::Gnome;
    
        my $keyring = Passwd::Keyring::Gnome->new(
             app=>"blahblah scraper",
             group=>"Johnny web scrapers",
        );
    
        my $username = "John";  # or get from .ini, or from .argv...
    
        my $password = $keyring->get_password($username, "blahblah.com");
        unless( $password ) {
            $password = <somehow interactively prompt for password>;
    
            # securely save password for future use
            $keyring->set_password($username, $password, "blahblah.com");
        }
    
        login_somewhere_using($username, $password);
        if( password_was_wrong ) {
            $keyring->clear_password($username, "blahblah.com");
        }

    Note: see Passwd::Keyring::Auto::KeyringAPI for detailed comments on
    keyring method semantics (this document is installed with
    Passwd::Keyring::Auto package).

SUBROUTINES/METHODS

 new(app=>'app name', group=>'passwords folder')

    Initializes the processing. Croaks if gnome keyring does not seem to be
    available.

    Handled named parameters:

    - app - symbolic application name (not used at the moment, but can be
    used in future as comment and in prompts, so set sensibly)

    - group - name for the password group (will be visible in seahorse so
    can be used by end user to manage passwords, different group means
    different password set, a few apps may share the same group if they
    need to use the same passwords set)

 set_password(username, password, realm)

    Sets (stores) password identified by given realm for given user

 get_password($user_name, $realm)

    Reads previously stored password for given user in given app. If such
    password can not be found, returns undef.

 clear_password($user_name, $realm)

    Removes given password (if present)

    Returns how many passwords actually were removed

 is_persistent

    Returns info, whether this keyring actually saves passwords
    persistently.

    (true in this case)
