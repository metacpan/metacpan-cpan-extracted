NAME
    Runops::Recorder - Runops replacement which saves what is being
    performed

SYNOPSIS
      # will save to a rr-<timestamp> directory in the current directory
      perl -MRunops::Recorder <program>

      # will save to a custom directory 
      perl -MRunops::Recorder=my_recording <program>
  
      # and then to view the recording
      rr-viewer <path to recording>

DESCRIPTION
    Runops::Recorder is an alternative runops which saves what it does into
    a file that can later be viewed using the rr-viewer tool.

HOW TO RECORD
    Simply use this module and it'll replace perl's standard runloop with
    its own. By default a recording goes into a directory named
    rr-<date>-_<time>. If you want an alternate name just pass it as the
    first argument to the use (eg -MRunops::Recorder=foo).

    Sometimes perl will optimize away COPs and this may look confusing when
    viewing. If you want to turn of the optimizer pass "-noopt" when using
    this module.

    It's possible to adjust the buffer size which is how much it'll keep in
    memory before flushing it to disk. This is done by passing "-bs=SIZE"
    where SIZE is a number followed by an optional G/M/K/g/m/k to denote the
    multiple. G, M and K are base-2 and g, m, k base-10. So 512K would be
    524288 bytes. If ommited a default of 64K is used. The minimum size is
    128 bytes.

    It is possible to prevent continous store to disk with "-nostore". This
    is ment to be used with "-die" that dumps the buffer to disk when an
    exception occurs.

VIEWING THE RECORDING
    Use the 'rr-viewer' tool. It just takes the path with the recording as
    an argument. Press 'q' to quit or any other key to step to the next
    event. Press 's' to skip any events in the current file until end of
    recording. Press 'a' to toggle wether we should skip whatever is in @INC
    when the recorder what loaded. Press 'h' for help.

    The environment variable RR_AUTORUN tells the viewer to run automaticly.
    The value should be the sleep time until stepping. And yes, it uses
    Time::HiRes so you can give it fracitonal seconds.

    If you set RR_SKIP_INC the autorun will not show @INC files as the 'a'
    option does.

FUNCTIONS
    dump ( $name )
        Dumps the buffer as *$name* in the recording. Adds .dump to the
        $name if ommited.

TODO
    Record more things such as changes to variables, opened file descriptors
    etc.
