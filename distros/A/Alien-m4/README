NAME

    Alien::m4 - Find or build GNU m4

VERSION

    version 0.19

SYNOPSIS

    From a Perl script

     use Alien::m4;
     use Env qw( @PATH );
     unshift @PATH, Alien::m4->bin_dir;  # m4 is now in your path

    From Alien::Base Build.PL

     use Alien:Base::ModuleBuild;
     my $builder = Module::Build->new(
       ...
       alien_bin_requires => {
         'Alien::m4' => '0.07',
       },
       ...
     );
     $builder->create_build_script;

DESCRIPTION

    This package can be used by other CPAN modules that require GNU m4.

METHODS

 exe

     my $m4 = Alien::m4->exe;

    Returns the "name" of m4. Normally this is m4, but on some platforms it
    may be gm4 or gnum4, or whatever is specified by $ENV{M4}.

HELPERS

 m4

     %{m4}

    Returns the name of the m4 command. Usually just m4.

CAVEATS

    Why GNU m4? Many Unixen come with BSD or other variants of m4 which are
    perfectly good. Unfortunately, the main use case for this module is
    Alien::Autotools and friends. Autoconf requires the GNU m4, probably
    for political reasons, possibly for technical reasons. If you are using
    one of these Unixen, don't despair, you can usually install the GNU
    version of m4 either by building from source or by installing a binary
    package, with either the name gm4 or gnum4, and this module will find
    it, and Alien::Autotools will be able to use it.
