NAME
    RT::Extension::ResetPassword - add "forgot your password?" link to RT
    instance

DESCRIPTION
    This extension for RT adds a new "Forgot your password?" link to the
    front of your RT instance. Any user can request that RT send them a
    password reset token by email. RT will send the user a one-time URL
    which he or she can use to reset her password.

    It also adds a new option to the user admin page in RT for the RT admin
    to send a password reset email for new users or users who have forgotten
    their passwords. See below for options to enable this admin feature only
    and disable self-service features.

RT VERSION
    Works with RT 6.0. For previous versions of RT install the latest 1.*
    version.

CONFIGURATION
    This extension resets passwords managed by RT. It cannot reset passwords
    for RTs that use any configured external auth such as SAML, OAuth, LDAP,
    or Active Directory as RT does not have password reset connections in
    those external systems.

    The contents of the email sent to users can be found in the global
    PasswordReset template (do not confuse this with the core PasswordChange
    template).

    If you want to prevent unauthorized visitors from determining what user
    accounts exist and whether they are disabled, set
    HidePasswordResetErrors to 1 in your RT configuration; then any password
    reset request will appear to the requestor to have resulted in an email
    being sent, thus not revealing the reasons for any failure. All failures
    will still be logged with an appropriate diagnostic message.

    For an RT open to the internet the most secure configuration is to use
    the default configuration ( This means setting no config options from
    below ). The default configuration only allows for existing users with
    an existing password to reset their password.

    If the rights schema for the RT is tight then it could be desirable to
    allow users who have a user record in RT ( They have emailed RT before )
    but no password to create a password for themselves by setting
    $AllowUsersWithoutPassword to 1. This can allow for any user to access
    the RT self service pages. This can be dangerous if the RT rights are
    not set-up correctly as users could see data they should not be able to.

    The $CreateNewUserAndSetPassword and $CreateNewUserAsPrivileged config
    options should only be used when access to the RT web UI is limited.
    This usually means access to the web UI is restricted so that only users
    on the company network can access the UI and create new user records.

    $AllowUsersWithoutPassword
        Setting this config option to true will allow existing users who do
        not have a password value to send themselves a reset password email
        and set a password.

        Setting this to false (0) requires a user to already have a password
        to use the reset feature. This is useful for managing access and not
        automatically allowing new accounts to get a password.

        This extension adds a "Password Status" at the bottom of the Access
        control section on the user admin page which shows whether the user
        currently has a password set. The "Delete password" option allows
        you to clear passwords if a user should no longer have access.

        For RT 4.4 and 5, this extension also adds a checkbox to the user
        admin page that allows you to filter users, displaying only those
        who have a password set. If you disable the
        $AllowUsersWithoutPassword option, this checkbox allows you to see
        all users who have an existing password and would therefore be able
        to reset their password.

    $CreateNewUserAsPrivileged
        Set this config value to true if users creating a new account should
        default to privileged users.

        WARNING Setting this to true can be dangerous as it allows anyone to
        create a new priviledged user. Usually privlidged users are given
        rights to edit and see information not desired to be public.

    $CreateNewUserAndSetPassword
        This configuration option determines if a nonexistant user can
        create an new user record.

        WARNING See the note about the danger of setting this to true and
        setting $CreateNewUserAsPrivileged to true as well.

    $DisableResetPasswordOnLogin
        Set this config value to true if you do not want the "forgot
        password" option to display on the login page.

        This is useful if you want only the password reset email option on
        the RT user admin page, but no self-service options.

    $PasswordChangeLinkExpirySeconds
        Set this config value to the time in seconds before a
        password-change link expires. The default value is 4*60*60, meaning
        that password-change links expire after four hours by default.

    $ResetPasswordFromAddress
        By default, the From address in the password reset email is the
        default $CorrespondAddress from RT. You can use this option to set a
        different From address for the reset email.
