Revision history for Net-IP-XS

0.21    5 February 2018
        - Avoid unnecessary calls to NI_ip_get_version when
          constructing objects (Github #2).

0.20    26 October 2017
        - Fix subroutine redefinition problem (RT #122438).

0.19    5 November 2016
        - Updated manifest.

0.18    3 November 2016
        - Fix strtol usage (RT #118605).
        - Fix parsing problem in ip_normalize (RT #118593).

0.17    22 March 2016
        - Make IP::Authority an optional dependency, as in Net::IP.

0.16    9 November 2015
        - Set array size correctly in NI_ip_is_ipv6 (RT #108605).

0.15    18 February 2015
        - Improve the fixes done as part of 0.14.
        - Fix a similar problem with the Net::IP::XS::N128 bindings.
          This only affects tests, since the IPv6 functions use the
          n128_t type directly.

0.14    17 February 2015
        - Update internal n128 handling so that IP objects can be used
          in conjunction with threads.

0.13    15 February 2014
        - Updated manifest.

0.12    15 February 2014
        - Adjust ip_is_ipv6 so that it rejects truncated addresses.
        - Handle '::' when it is used to shorten a single 16-bit
          field. (Such an address is technically invalid (RFC 5952
          [4.2.2]), but this change is in keeping with this module's
          generally lax approach to parsing.)

0.11    20 June 2013
        - Fix IPv4 object size problem (if a range began at 0.0.0.0,
          size() returned (1 << 32), regardless of the actual size of
          the range).

0.10    22 December 2012
        - Minor text/makefile updates.

0.09    16 May 2012
        - Remove Tie::Hash::Sorted dependency. It was not strictly
          necessary that the hash always be sorted, and it's more in
          line with how Net::IP works for it to only sort when
          NI_ip_iptype is called.
        - Fix NI_ip_is_ipv4 and NI_ip_is_ipv6 problems (both were
          writing past the end of an array in some cases).
        - Add 128-bit integer tests.

0.08    15 May 2012
        - Remove GMP dependency.
        - Fix NI_ip_aggregate memory error on invalid input.
        - Change NI_ip_binadd's behaviour on invalid input (non-zeroes
          treated as ones).
        - NI_ip_bintoint will now return at most ((1 << 128) - 1).
        - NI_ip_inttobin's result will now always be either 32 or 128
          characters in length.

0.07    18 August 2011
        - NI_ip_compress_v4_prefix now matches the behaviour of the
          version from Net::IP (it was returning incorrect results
          when the prefix length was not on an octet boundary).

0.06    11 March 2011
        - Fixed 0.05 change (it led to a memory leak in NI_aggregate).
        - Now compiles when using a C++ compiler (tested with gcc-g++).
        - Miscellaneous problems (wrong types, unused variables).

0.05    08 March 2011
        - Missing 'return 0' statement on aggregation failure in the 
          IPv6 aggregate object method.

0.04    07 March 2011
        - Use Devel::CheckLib when installing to see whether GMP 
          is present.

0.03    26 February 2011
        - Modified NI_ip_compress_address so that it does not use '::' 
          to shorten a single 16-bit 0 field (see RFC 5952).

0.02    10 April 2010
        - Added ip_add_num function and +/bool overloads.
        - Added 'PROC' export tag.

0.01    06 April 2010
        - Initial release.
