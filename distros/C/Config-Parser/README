Config::Parser and Config::Parser::Ini
======================================

Config::Parser provides a framework for writing configuration file
parsers.  It is an intermediate layer between the abstract syntax tree
(Config::AST) and implementation of a parser for a particular
configuration file format.

Config::Parser::Ini is a configuration file parser for ini-style files.

EXAMPLE

  use Config::Parser::Ini;
  # Parse the configuration
  my $cf = new Config::Parser::Ini(filename => "config.ini");
  # Access a configuration setting
  print $cf->get('core', 'root');
  
  __DATA__
  # Declare valid keywords:
  [core]
     root = STRING :default /
     umask = OCTAL
  [user]
     uid = NUMBER
     gid = NUMBER
