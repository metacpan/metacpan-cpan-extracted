NAME
    MooseX::ClosedHash - blessed coderefs (closing over a hash) with Moose

SYNOPSIS
       use v5.14;
   
       package Person {
          use MooseX::ClosedHash;
          has name => (is => "rw");
          has age  => (is => "rw");
          __PACKAGE__->meta->make_immutable;
       }
   
       my $bob = Person->new(name => "Bob", age => 42);
   
       say $bob->name, " is ", $bob->age, " years old.";
       say $bob->dump;

DESCRIPTION
    MooseX::ClosedHash is a Moose module that lets you store your object's
    attributes in a hash, closed over by a blessed coderef.

    Why? I have no idea why you'd want to do this.

    It provides a modicum of privacy I suppose. Privacy that is easily
    violated, but that you're unlikely to accidentally violate.
