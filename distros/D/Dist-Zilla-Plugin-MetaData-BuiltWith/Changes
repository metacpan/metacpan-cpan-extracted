 - Added tests
 - Prereqs retrieved directly from Dist::Zilla now *WITHOUT* using EmulatePhase.

 - This is the primary reason for the 1.x on the box.

 [Bugfix]
 - BuiltWith::All ocasionally messed up when it found certain modules in %INC which had names such that it was
   impossible to load them ( Anon classes, Mx Types ), and these needlessly caused failures. Fixed.

 [00_Note]
 - Accidentally lost the source code entirely for 0.03xxxyyy, so had to sort of reconstruct that history. Also
   accidentally released it as 0.02000101 due to not having said code and not realising it.

 - Defer module version checks to later to help bootstrap.

 [Dependencies]

0.02000000 2012-02-27T03:48:01Z
 [Bugfixes]
 - This release should hopefully neuter the occasional glitch that occured due to $_ being clobbered in a few places
   yeilding a package of 'undef', which emits broken META.yml. Hopefully this should resolve rt#63930
