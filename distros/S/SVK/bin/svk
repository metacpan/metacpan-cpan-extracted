SVK requires the Scalar::Util module be built with support for  the 'weaken'
function. 

It is sometimes the case that operating system upgrades will replace 
a working Scalar::Util with a non-working one. If your system was working
correctly up until now, this is likely the cause of the problem.

Please reinstall Scalar::Util, being careful to let it build with your C 
compiler. Usually this is as simple as running the following command as
root:

    perl -MCPAN -e'install Scalar::Util'

EOF

=head1 NAME

svk - A Distributed Version Control System

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<svk> I<command> S<[I<options>]> [I<args>]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<SVK> is a decentralized version control system written in Perl.
It uses the Subversion filesystem but provides additional features:

=over 4

=item * Offline operations like C<checkin>, C<log>, C<merge>.

=item * Distributed branches.

=item * Lightweight checkout copy management (no F<.svn> directories).

=item * Advanced merge algorithms, like I<star-merge> and I<cherry picking>.

=back

For more information about the SVK project, visit L<http://svk.bestpractical.com/>.

Run C<svk help> to access the built-in tool documentation.

By default svk stores its state in the F<.svk> directory in your home
directory. You can change this default by setting the SVKROOT environment
variable to your preferred svk depot path.
