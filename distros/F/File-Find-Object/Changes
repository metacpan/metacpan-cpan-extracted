0.3.2   2017-01-13
    - Made the version number consistent across the .pm files.
        - https://bitbucket.org/shlomif/perl-file-find-object/issues/1/wrong-version-number
        - Thanks to aer0 for the report.

0.3.1   2017-01-09
    - Fixed an issue with tracking the depth of the inodes when detecting
    a symlink loop.
        - Detected by several cygwin reports.

0.3.0   2016-09-11
    - Converted the build system to Dist-Zilla.
        - Part of the impetus was removing the warning about
        Test::TrailingSpace needed for the trailing whitespace tests
        (which in turn requires this modules) which was reported to us as a
        problem by someone (despite not being a real issue).

0.2.13  2015-04-07
    - Clarified the documentation regarding the use/return of array
    references.

0.2.12  2014-11-28
    - Made sure no two t/*.t test scripts share temp paths.
        - This caused failure with HARNESS_OPTIONS="j9".
        - Thanks to ETHER for the report:
            - http://www.cpantesters.org/cpan/report/2711a2ec-7401-11e4-8c78-d7697441a48b

0.2.11  2014-03-26
    - Add $VERSION globally to all packages in lib/.
        - This was done to silence some warnings from PAUSE.
    - Add scripts/bump-version-number.pl to update it.

0.2.10  2014-03-26
    - Correct a misspelling reported by dsteinbrunner.
        - https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=94206
    - Fix Build.PL by excluding the 'license' URL from the resources.
        - New versions of Module::Build add it automatically.

0.2.9   2014-01-29
    - Convert from "use base" to the more modern "use parent".
    - Minimal version on perl-5.008 (CPANTS Kwalitee).
    - Add the LICENSE file - CPANTS Kwalitee.

0.2.8   2013-08-17
    - Fix https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=87901
        - repository metadata duplication.

0.2.7   2013-05-21
    - Convert this file to t/cpan-changes.t .

0.2.6   2012-11-25
    - Correct a typo:
        - see https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=81428
        - Thanks to Xavier Guimard for the report.
    - Remove trailing space.

0.2.5   2012-07-12
    - Add the scripts/tag-release.pl script to tag a release in the
    Mercurial repository.
        - The problem is that I'm using different conventions for the
        names of the tags in different repositories and wish to introduce
        some consistency.

0.2.4   2012-07-12
    - Update the link to the new repository at bitbucket.org.
    - Add cleanup for a temporary directory in the tests.

0.2.3   2009-07-30
    - 0.2.2 seems to have been deleted. Re-uploading.
        - thanks to lwpetre

0.2.2   2009-06-25
    - added some META.yml resources.
        - added META.yml keywords.

0.2.1   2009-06-18
    - Optimization: removed the _dir field of File::Find::Object::PathComp
    and its _dir_copy copy-accessor, and replaced them all with passing
    the $dir_str explicitly. This reduced the code considerably, and
    eliminated a similar symptom to this one:
        - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schlemiel_the_painter%27s_Algorithm
    - Added the ->is_file() method to ::Result.
    - Converted ::Result->is_dir() to use -d _
    - Added ::Result->is_link().

0.2.0   2009-02-22
    - Optimization: now not checking for the existence of the callback() after
    every iteration, in case it doesn't exist. Instead, the default_actions
    is calculated according to its existence when the tree traverser
    is initialized.
    - Refactoring/Optimization: avoided having two _set_obj() methds by
    calling _set_obj() from _run_cb().

0.1.9   2009-02-10
    - Added use integer to the modules, because they don't make use
    of floating-point calculation. It may be a minor optimization, but then
    again it may be not.
    - Optimization: optimized the loop detection by having a hash lookup
    of inodes in each path component, that are built incrementally and checked
    for every subsequent node.
    - Optimization: replaced the _top_it() of _me_die() with a normal method
    with a conditional, as it was the only place where _top_it() was still
    used.
    - Optimization/Cleanup: _set_inodes() in ::DeepPath.
    - Clarified the licensing blurbs of the .pm files.

0.1.8   2009-01-19
    - Optimization/Refactoring: replaced the last call to ->_father with a
    call to _current_father(). Removed ->_father and optimized
    _current_father() .
    - Optimization/Refactoring: refactored _become_default() to remove
    the execessive use of $father and $father->idx(). Now ->idx() is
    no longer needed and will be removed next.
    - Optimization/Refactoring: removed the ->idx() method as it
    was no longer used and needed.
    - Optimization: instead of calling File::Find::Object::Result->new()
    just bless to it.
    - Optimization: now caching the filesystem device at
    the top for nocrossfs().
        - Plus: rearranged the order of the checks in
        _non_top__check_subdir_helper
    - Optimization/Refactoring: made the _top_it method names saner,
    and removed an unused one.
    - Refactoring: refactored _check_subdir_helper_d() to make
    the conditions clearer.
    - Optimization: now compiling the _check_subdir_helper function
    by eval ""'ing it because it contains many conditions that depend
    on instance-wide and constant parameters.
    - Cleanup: moved some POD'ed out functions to under rejects/ .
    - Optimization: renamed _calc_next_obj() to next_obj(), as next_obj()
    just called it directly. Cleaned up the rest of the logic in next_obj().
    - Bug fix: the nocrossfs option was fixed. Previously it used an undefined
    method.

0.1.7   2009-01-15
    - Fixed the check-for-link and for directory semantics on Windows
    and other systems. Converted to "perldoc -f lstat" instead of
    "perldoc -f stat", and using stat only for symbolic links to check
    if they are directories. Now added a test for that.
        - Fixed t/01ffo.t to check for the warning.
        - Also see: http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/2009/01/msg143399.html
    - Small optimization: converted a loop with:
    while($ptr) { ... } continue { $ptr = $self->_father($ptr); }
    to List::Util::first.
    - Added more dependencies to Build.PL / Makefile.PL including
    List::Util.

0.1.6   2009-01-09
    - Converted the accessor generator to Class::XSAccessor instead
    of Class::Accessor. After consulting Devel::NYTProf, it seemed that
    the majority of the time of a simple File-Find-Object scan was spent
    in Class::Accessor. Hopefully, this will make F-F-O run faster.
    - A small optimization - added a flag to $self with whether the stack
    is full or not. This is used inside _top_it() and _is_top().
    - A small optimization - implemented _current directly instead of
    a _top / _non_top version - saved 2.5 seconds of runtime.
    - A small optimization - got rid of _current_components_copy() (which
    was useless because _current_components already returns a dynamic
    reference) and replaced all calls with calls to _current_components().
    - A small optimization - ->dir() instead of ->_dir_copy() for
    a function whose return value is dereferenced and flatted.
    - A small optimization - now caching the results of _current_components
    inside an accessor and updating it upon every change.
    - A small optimization - now caching the results of _current_path()
    upon every modification of _current_components, so File::Spec->catfile()
    won't be called excessively.
    - Optimization/Refactoring - changed the actions() handling so instead
    of having the indices, we calculate an array of master actions at
    start that correspond with the depth() parameter, and then assign it for
    each PathComponent object in turn based on $top. This is instead of
    the indexes and explicit calculations etc., which was both messier
    and slower.
    - Optimization/Refactoring - renamed _current_components() to
    _curr_comps() and _current_path to _curr_path() to make them
    shorter and faster. Added a comment explaining what they are.
    - Optimization/Refactoring - optimized _calc_current_item_obj.
    - Optimization - removed an _is_top() conditional in _recurse() that
    was likely not to be evaluated, by re-arranging the order of _mystat
    call. Now _mystat is not an action, but rather called explicitly.
    _is_top() is now PODded-out because it's not used.
    - Refactoring - made the top path component-handling object a separate
    object (::PathTop) instead of $top/$tree . Hopefully, this will later
    allow caching _current(), and having a unified directory stack.
    - Refactoring - created a base class for Path-Components (i.e: ::PathTop
    and ::PathComponent). Most of the methods out of ::Base belong there
    so they were moved. This class inherits from ::Base, but there's not
    a lot there anymore.
    - Refactoring - renamed ::PathComponent as ::DeepPath and ::PathTop
    as ::TopPath. Otherwise they could be confused with ::PathComp.
    - Refactoring - made the first ::PathTop component the first element
    in _dir_stack() so we won't need to keep in a distinct reference. All
    the other elements moved 1 level down the stack.
    - Optimization - now caching $top->_dir_stack()->[-1] into
    $top->_current() as an accessor.

0.1.5   2009-01-03
    - Unified the two calls to stat() (and several calls to other file
    operators) in order to reduce the number of system calls/disk accesses
    issued by File::Find::Object.
    - Refactored the code from the last change and added
    File::Find::Object::Result->stat_ret() for the return value of stat().

0.1.4   2008-12-25
    - Bug fix: made sure ->item_obj() is available on the first call
    to the callback() and is properly synchronized with it.

0.1.3   2008-11-12
    - Refactoring: converted _movenext() from pseudo-conditionals
    to polymorphism by making it a method of ->_current().
    - Refactoring: extracted the _next_traverse_to() method.
    - Bug fix (with possible correctness/SECURITY implications):
        - now correctly handling files and directories whose filenames
        are false in Perl - most notable "0".

0.1.2   2008-10-26
    - Corrected the README.
    - Now checking for inodes that are 0, when checking for cyclical trees,
    as a fix for stat() calls on systems that do not support them. This should
    fix Win32 test failures (and bad behaviour in general) like the following:          - http://nntp.x.perl.org/group/perl.cpan.testers/2479582

0.1.1   2008-10-22
    - Potential Security Fix!!! No longer passing a filename directly to
    the format in <<printf (STDERR)>> when warning on a loop.
    - Bug fix - the check for a loop was broken.
    - New Feature - Added the ->next_obj() and ->item_obj() methods
    to return a File::Find::Object::Result object instead of a plain
    path.
    - Refactoring:
        - No longer passing $current explicitly from one method to another
        (hello EEK!). Instead, we reference $self->_current()
        - Remmed out the DESTROY method as it was empty.
        - Revamped the _action handling - an array instead of a hash.
        - Created _top and _non_top methods delegated by _is_top using
            _top_it()
        - _current_idx() was eliminated - now it's just $#dir_stack.
        - Created a _copy methods to create flat copies of array references.
        - Extracted many methods.
    - Switched Build.PL to inc/Test/Run/Builder.pm - that gives us:
        - ./Build runtest
        - ./Build distruntest
        - ./Build tags

0.1.0   2008-03-05
    - Now handling directories that cannot be opendir()'ed in a graceful
    manner - just not traversing them further.

0.0.9   2008-02-22
    - Now running canonpath() on the targets in the call to
      File::Find::Object->new. That way, trailing slashes are omitted in
      the results.
    - Allow File::Find::Object to properly accept paths to regular
      files as input paths. Fixes:
        http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=33453
      Thanks to Sergey V Panteleev for reporting the bug.
    - TODO : check behavior on traversing non-existant paths.
        - Done.
    - Now skipping non-existant files.
        - Added a test for it in t/03traverse.t

0.0.8   2007-07-31
    - added the empty PL_FILES key to the Makefile.PL to avoid running
    Build.PL on older versions of EU::MM.

0.0.7   2007-02-02
    - moved the tree script under the examples directory.
    - added the LICENSE section to the POD.
    - added t/pod.t and t/pod-coverage.t and made sure the module
      has full POD coverage.
    - added a Build.PL build script to generate a better META.yml file.
    - all of these are Kwalitee improvements.
      ( http://cpants.perl.org/dist/File-Find-Object )
    - Added some links to the main POD documentation for similar modules
      and for the Perl Advent article.

0.0.6   2006-11-28
    - Added the following new interface methods:
        - set_traverse_to
        - get_traverse_to
        - get_current_node_files_list
        - prune
    - Some changes to the internals to accomodate for them.

0.0.5   2006-09-03
    - Eliminated the F-F-O-internal isa F-F-O relationship.
    - Created accessors for everything - now based on Class::Accessor
    - F-F-O-internal is now named File::Find::Object::PathComponent
    - Some smaller refactorings.

0.0.4   2006-08-23
    - Eliminated circular references. (Hopefully)
        - Still have an isa relationship between File::Find::Object and
        File::Find::Object::internal, which is what handles each recursed to
        directory.
    - Created some accessor functions instead of direct hash accesses.

0.0.3   2006-07-14
    - Fixed some language problems in the POD.
    - Added the Changes file.
    - Changed the license to GPL/Artistic/Artistic-2.0
    - Placed the .pm files inside lib.
    - Added the TreeCreate module under t/lib (with appropriate tests) to test
    the main module.
    - Made the default test order lexicographical, and predictable. In the
    process, eliminated keeping the directory handles, and possibly the fact
    that they are kept open.
    - Fixed a bug where circular references prevented the module from being
    destroyed.
