 [ Packaging ]
 - Add myself as maintainer rather than developer; this should ensure that
   I don't get listed in 'x_contributors'.

 - Silence warnings under 'perl -w'. (But you shouldn't use 'perl -w'
   anyway.)

 - Optionally export 'provided' function.

 - Use PerlX::Maybe::XS if it's available - roughly 30% faster.

0.002	2012-05-03

 - Faster implementation. Tested on Perl 5.10.1 on Linux, the new version
   is 60% faster. (Not that it was slow to begin with - 'maybe' is a pretty
   simple function.)
