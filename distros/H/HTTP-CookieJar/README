NAME
    HTTP::CookieJar - A minimalist HTTP user agent cookie jar

VERSION
    version 0.012

SYNOPSIS
      use HTTP::CookieJar;

      my $jar = HTTP::CookieJar->new;

      # add cookie received from a request
      $jar->add( "http://www.example.com/", "CUSTOMER=WILE_E_COYOTE; Path=/; Domain=example.com" );

      # extract cookie header for a given request
      my $cookie = $jar->cookie_header( "http://www.example.com/" );

DESCRIPTION
    This module implements a minimalist HTTP user agent cookie jar in
    conformance with RFC 6265 <http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6265>.

    Unlike the commonly used HTTP::Cookies module, this module does not
    require use of HTTP::Request and HTTP::Response objects. An
    LWP-compatible adapter is available as HTTP::CookieJar::LWP.

CONSTRUCTORS
  new
        my $jar = HTTP::CookieJar->new;

    Return a new, empty cookie jar

METHODS
  add
        $jar->add(
            "http://www.example.com/", "lang=en-US; Path=/; Domain=example.com"
        );

    Given a request URL and a "Set-Cookie" header string, attempts to adds
    the cookie to the jar. If the cookie is expired, instead it deletes any
    matching cookie from the jar. A "Max-Age" attribute will be converted to
    an absolute "Expires" attribute.

    It will throw an exception if the request URL is missing or invalid.
    Returns true if successful cookie processing or undef/empty-list on
    failure.

  clear
        $jar->clear

    Empties the cookie jar.

  cookies_for
        my @cookies = $jar->cookies_for("http://www.example.com/foo/bar");

    Given a request URL, returns a list of hash references representing
    cookies that should be sent. The hash references are copies -- changing
    values will not change the cookies in the jar.

    Cookies set "secure" will only be returned if the request scheme is
    "https". Expired cookies will not be returned.

    Keys of a cookie hash reference might include:

    *   name -- the name of the cookie

    *   value -- the value of the cookie

    *   domain -- the domain name to which the cookie applies

    *   path -- the path to which the cookie applies

    *   expires -- if present, when the cookie expires in epoch seconds

    *   secure -- if present, the cookie was set "Secure"

    *   httponly -- if present, the cookie was set "HttpOnly"

    *   hostonly -- if present, the cookie may only be used with the domain
        as a host

    *   creation_time -- epoch seconds since the cookie was first stored

    *   last_access_time -- epoch seconds since the cookie was last stored

    Keep in mind that "httponly" means it should only be used in requests
    and not made available via Javascript, etc. This is pretty meaningless
    for Perl user agents.

    Generally, user agents should use the "cookie_header" method instead.

    It will throw an exception if the request URL is missing or invalid.

  cookie_header
        my $header = $jar->cookie_header("http://www.example.com/foo/bar");

    Given a request URL, returns a correctly-formatted string with all
    relevant cookies for the request. This string is ready to be used in a
    "Cookie" header in an HTTP request. E.g.:

        SID=31d4d96e407aad42; lang=en-US

    It follows the same exclusion rules as "cookies_for".

    If the request is invalid or no cookies apply, it will return an empty
    string.

  dump_cookies
        my @list = $jar->dump_cookies;
        my @list = $jar->dump_cookies( { persistent => 1 } );

    Returns a list of raw cookies in string form. The strings resemble what
    would be received from "Set-Cookie" headers, but with additional
    internal fields. The list is only intended for use with "load_cookies"
    to allow cookie jar persistence.

    If a hash reference with a true "persistent" key is given as an
    argument, cookies without an "Expires" time (i.e. "session cookies")
    will be omitted.

    Here is a trivial example of saving a cookie jar file with Path::Tiny:

        path("jar.txt")->spew( join "\n", $jar->dump_cookies );

  load_cookies
        $jar->load_cookies( @cookies );

    Given a list of cookie strings from "dump_cookies", it adds them to the
    cookie jar. Cookies added in this way will supersede any existing
    cookies with similar domain, path and name.

    It returns the jar object for convenience when loading a new object:

        my $jar = HTTP::CookieJar->new->load_cookies( @cookies );

    Here is a trivial example of loading a cookie jar file with Path::Tiny:

        my $jar = HTTP::CookieJar->new->load_cookies(
            path("jar.txt")->lines
        );

LIMITATIONS AND CAVEATS
  RFC 6265 vs prior standards
    This modules adheres as closely as possible to the user-agent rules of
    RFC 6265. Therefore, it does not handle nor generate "Set-Cookie2" and
    "Cookie2" headers, implement ".local" suffixes, or do path/domain
    matching in accord with prior RFC's.

  Internationalized domain names
    Internationalized domain names given in requests must be properly
    encoded in ASCII form.

  Public suffixes
    If Mozilla::PublicSuffix is installed, cookie domains will be checked
    against the public suffix list. Public suffix cookies are only allowed
    as host-only cookies.

  Third-party cookies
    According to RFC 6265, a cookie may be accepted only if has no "Domain"
    attribute (in which case it is "host-only") or if the "Domain" attribute
    is a suffix of the request URL. This effectively prohibits Site A from
    setting a cookie for unrelated Site B, which is one potential
    third-party cookie vector.
