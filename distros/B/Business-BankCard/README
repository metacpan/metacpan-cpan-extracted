    provide a list of IIN codes, routines to parse a card number into
    components, routines to validate card number, etc.

    About bank card number: Bank card numbers are found on payment cards,
    such as credit cards and debit cards. They have a certain amount of
    internal structure and shares a common numbering scheme. Bank card
    numbers are allocated in accordance with ISO/IEC 7812. An ISO/IEC 7812
    number is typically 16 digits in length. It consists of: 1) a six-digit
    Issuer Identification Number (IIN), the first digit of which is the
    Major Industry Identifier (MII); 2) a variable length (up to 12 digits)
    individual account identifier; 3) a single check digit calculated using
    the Luhn algorithm.

    The term "Issuer Identification Number" (IIN) replaces the previously
    used "Bank Identification Number" (BIN). See ISO/IEC 7812 for more
    information.
