Revision history for Perl extension Shell::POSIX::Select.

0.01  Sun May  4 00:47:26 PDT 2003
		- original version; created by h2xs 1.21 with options
						-XA -n Shell::POSIX::Select

0.02  Mon May  5 11:07:55 PDT 2003
		- fixed some typos and bugs in sample scripts
		- reworked documentation slightly
		- deleted some test programs, modified others
		- removed some debugging statements to simplify code

0.03  Mon May  5 17:51:54 PDT 2003
		- fixed more typos in documentation
		- rearranged documentation slightly
		- added some diagnostics to test.pl

0.04  Thu May  8 10:34:49 PDT 2003
		- enhanced "Failure to identify" section in docs
		- modified test.pl to omit screen dumps for comparison testing;
				seems that even with buffering disabled, order of STDERR vs STDOUT
				outputs is unpredictable, and causing tests to fail although
				everything actually works okay
		- removed disturbing messages from eval if killed by signal

0.05  Sun May 11 11:34:59 PDT 2003
		- removed large chunks of commented-out code, no longer needed
		- dumbed-down the markup for SYNOPSIS in documentation, which the 
				PAUSE version of pod2html was not handling correctly correctly.
