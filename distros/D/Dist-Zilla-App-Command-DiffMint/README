NAME
    Dist::Zilla::App::Command::CompareMint - Compare files to what a minting
    profile produces

SYNOPSIS
      $ dzil diff-mint [ --provider=<provider> ] [ --profile=<profile> ] [ <file> ]

DESCRIPTION
    Displays a diff of the current dist with what would be created by
    minting a dist with the same name.

    Additional files in the current dist, files in the `t` or `lib`
    directories, `Changes`, and `Changelog` files will be ignored.

    While the output is produced using unified diff format, it is only meant
    to be interpreted by a human.

OPTIONS
    --color[=<when>]
        Show colored diff. If "<when>" is not specified or is "always",
        color will be used. If "<when>" is "auto" or when the option is not
        specified, color will be used when the output is a terminal.

    --no-pager
        Avoid using a pager. By default, $PAGER or "less" will be used if
        the output is a terminal.

    --provider=<provider>
        The minting provider to compare against. If not specified, it will
        try to use the value configured in the "[%Mint]" section of either
        the dist.ini or ~/.dzil/config.ini file.

    --profile=<profile>
        The minting profile to compare against. If not specified, it will
        try to use the value configured in the "[%Mint]" section of either
        the dist.ini or ~/.dzil/config.ini file.

    --reverse
        Generate the diff in reverse order.
