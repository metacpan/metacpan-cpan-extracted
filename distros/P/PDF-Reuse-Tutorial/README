PDF/Reuse/Tutorial version 0.11
===============================

This is dummy module created only for the POD documentation

INSTALLATION

To install this module in a Windows environment:
   
   perl Makefile.PL
   nmake
   nmake test
   nmake install

(If you haven't got nmake, try to download it via
http://download.microsoft.com/download/vc15/Patch/1.52/W95/EN-US/Nmake15.exe)


Under other operating systems try the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install
   
   

N.B.
In the examples directory there is a zip file with PDF documents and generated
modules. Unzip it. I had to put all these files like that, to hide them from
the normal processing around the upload to CPAN.
