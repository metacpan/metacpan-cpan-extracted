NAME
    Module::Package::RDF - drive your distribution with RDF

SYNOPSIS
    In your Makefile.PL:

      use inc::Module::Package 'RDF';

    That's all folks!

DESCRIPTION
    Really simple Makefile.PL.

FLAVOURS
    Currently this module only defines the ":standard" flavour.

  :standard
    This is the default, so the following are equivalent:

      use inc::Module::Package 'RDF';
      use inc::Module::Package 'RDF:standard';

    In addition to the inherited behavior, this flavour uses the following
    plugins:

    *   AutoLicense

    *   AutoManifest

    *   Copyright

    *   Credits

    *   DOAP

    *   DOAPChangeSets

    *   RDF

    *   ReadmeFromPod

    *   TrustMetaYml

    And sets "static_config" and "sign".
