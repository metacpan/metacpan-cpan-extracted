	thanks to Slaven Rezic for spotting it and providing the solution.

0.83  Wed Nov 21 13:06:35 PST 2007
	This release includes a major upgrade to the way in which
	IP's are added to an removed from the database. IP's whose
	PTR record match the generic form 'ddd.ddd.ddd.ddd' were
	targeted for optional inclusion in the permanent zonefile
	in rev 0.83. This concept has been expanded in this release
	to include automated addition to the zonefile (evidence
	database) of IP's that match a configurable regular 
	expression list for both mailfilter and BLcheck scripts.
	In addition, for the BLcheck script the additions can be
	alternatively made to the internal (non-zonefile blcontrib db)
	which are also removable by BLpreen script.

	Matching updates have been made to the helper routine
	Net::DNSBL::MultiDaemon which prefilters connections to the
	mail system before BLcheck runs.
	
	updated sc_Blacklist.conf.example to change 
	sbl.spamhaus.org to zen.spamhaus.org
	removed relays.ordb.org, commented out bl.spamcop.net
	because it is way to aggressive.

	when no zonedump pid file is found

	fix typo in public_html/incl/delist.incl

	subroutine xcidr24 is deprecated and removed, replaced
	with Xcidr24 that has an enhanced API

	GENERIC PTR record checking and CIDR24 checking
	is added to sub BLcheck in ScriptSupport v0.48

	configuration for sc_mailfilter.conf XCIDR24
	and sc_BLcheck GENERIC is enhanced and added
	respectively

	change ignor, regexp GENERIC detection to ignore case
	in ScriptSupport.pm v0.49

	add bogon dnsbl to sc_BlackList
	add page to return PTR records for an IP address

	when required header match fails

0.80  Mon Jun 25 09:51:43 PDT 2007
	in ParseMessage 0.09 add sub to conditionally remove blank
	lines and trim the total number of lines in the message portion 
	of the spam sample if 'MSGMAX' is in the config file

	in ScriptSupport 0.42 add call to trimmsg above.

	added 'block4zonedump' to ScriptSupport.pm v0.40
	add call to 'block4zonedump' to scripts
	sc_BLcheck.pl, sc_BLpreen.pl, sc_cleanup.pl

	zonedumps for very large zone files are perturbed by blcheck and
	blpreen IP additions and deletions. This addition to the script
	files allows them to block until the zonedump completes

0.78  Thu Oct 19 08:06:45 PDT 2006
	removed stub zone collection from contrib/zonedump.pl
	and ScriptSupport::dns2rblz v0.39 -- concept flawed
	use Net::Bind::rbldnsdAccessor instead

    In DNSBLserver v0.40
	add -C continuity flag, default '0', this is a BEHAVIOR CHANGE
	For very large zones and multiple daemons constantly adding
	and removing records, it is very difficult to get a contiguous
	zone dump where the starting and ending serial number is constant.
	Instead, re-sync the cursor to ignore BerkeleyDB's behavior of
	renumbering the records after an insert or delete. This allows
	a zone dump to proceed when record values that have already
	been read are deleted or inserts are made to the area the cursor
	has already transversed. More specifically, records ahead of the 
	cursor will appear in the zone file as they are transversed, records
	altered behind the cursor are not seen so effectively the zone is
	frozen for dump purposes at the instant the cursor transverse it.
	With "Continuity" set true, a single unperterbed snapshot of the
	database is dumped to the zone file. However, this method will fail
	if records are added or removed during the dump. The dump will
	automatically retry 3 times. The practical aspect of this change
	is that it is as if the zone was read a minute or two earlier in
	the case of similtaneous database updates.

	The old -C behavior is not desirable for large zones because it is
	not practical for the database to remain static long enough for 
	a complete zone dump. The behavior is deprecated, the -C flag is
	provided to retain the old behavior if for some strange reason
	you find it desirable.
	
	Removed redundant tests for 127.0.0.0 and 127.0.0.1
	in ns.c and zonefile.c

	corrected and old bug in zonefile.c that dumped 127.0.0.1
	records to the zonefile


0.58  Fri Apr 15 15:57:36 PDT 2005

	Corrected description of "sub rfheaders" in ParseMessage.pm v0.07

	to SMTPsend that will be spooled to completion.

	Add abuse_host to ScriptSupport v0.28
	This subroutine supports abuse_host.pl + documentation

	Add Quick Start documentation to document tree.

	for the addition.

	Update the SpamCannibal "home" page and add configurable
	site blacklist reason.

	Add configurable 'reason' to sc_web.conf
	This allows the site user to customize the text at the end of the 
	SpamCannibal home page so that it is specific for the local site.

	Change public_html/cannibal.cgi v1.23 to support 'reason' in config file

	Add dnsbl_stats.shtml to contrib directory. This page is from the

		T_ANY
	);
	Net::DNS::ToolKit qw(
		get16

	These are needed by runtime scripts that remain.
	Update to ScriptSupport v0.27

0.44  Wed Sep  1 15:35:37 PDT 2004

		revIP   
		query  
		dns_udpsend
		dns_udpresp
		dns_ans
		dns_ns
		dns_ptr
		rlook_send

	modified cannible.cgi v1.22 to use Net::DNS::ToolKit::Utilities

0.43  not released
	in BDBaccess(v0.18)/CTest.xs and DNSBLserver(v0.30)/CTest.xs,
	update CTest.xs to eliminate use of "putchar" which conflicts
	with buffered/unbuffered use of IO in testing

	Tune DNAT documentation.
	Tune IPTABLES QUEUE documentation.
	Tune spam_report.cgi.example summary screen comments.

	Add additional test in cannibal.cgi v1.21 to detect 
	undefined $query{query}.

	(failed in Firefox 0.92 without the qualifier).

	Add init file 'rc_debian_spamcannibal' to contrib

0.42  Sun Jun 27 14:01:44 PDT 2004
	updated the documentation to include bastion host DNAT
	instructions for setting up a tarpit connection where 
	the server is behind the bastion host

0.41  Sun Jun 27 09:04:56 PDT 2004
	DNSBLserver 0.29
	Added 'stop' variable for testing in main.c to intercept
	processing of the -T flag and stop STDOUT
	# Something in perl 5.8 does not allow the redirection of
	# STDOUT in an eval to a C program. The workaround is
	# simply to abort the call to 'main' just prior to issuing
	# the print statements since this is all tested elsewhere
	#

	DNSBLserver 0.28 - unreleased
	added time tag to zone file dump in dnsbls::zonefile.c

	changed test for zone dump so that it just checks for the
	presence of a "zone_request" instead of no other activity + zone_request

0.40  Sat Jun 26 12:09:14 PDT 2004
	Update INSTALL document about BIND zone forward method

0.39  Thu Jun 24 11:35:08 PDT 2004
	oops! Fixed  PGP code in ScriptSupport::mailcheck v0.24 
	that had been commented out for debugging

0.38  not released to CPAN, but was on the web site for awhile
	minor (annoying) bug fixes... my bad :-(

	commented out several "use diagnostics" inadvertently remaining

	corrected test at line 1624 of ScriptSupport.pm v0.23 which failed 
	on undefined value, reversed order of test to detect undefined first

0.37  Wed Jun 23 19:42:20 PDT 2004
	Minor updates to the INSTALL document re: dnsbl installation

	corrected major typo in sc_session.pl v1.08 that pointed to the dbhome
	directory. The recent upgrade of IPTables... uncovered a missing
	variable in the SiteConfig hash that was duplicated in IPTables
	and did not (should not) exist in SpamCannibal SiteConfig.

	added test in cannibal.cgi v1.20 to detect missing query and ignore.

0.36  Wed Jun 23 13:10:52 PDT 2004
	updated the documentation in ./config/sc_Blacklist.conf
	to clarify problems with the timeouts in sendmail when using
	Net::DNSBL::MultiDaemon

	removed duplicate use [module] qw(inet_aton inet_ntoa);
	in cannibal.cgi. Also, line 826
			=~ spamlst...
	should be	=~ /^spamlst/...
	Thanks to "Jonathan Baker-Bates" <jonathan@bakerbates.com>
	for spotting those two mistakes.

    Changes to DNSBLserver 0.26
	fixed bug in ns.c that prevented 127.xx.xx.xx response TXT strings
	inserted by rc.dnsbls from being reported

	added zonefile.c and zonedump.c so that dnsbls can
	dump a zonefile to the dbhome directory on receipt
	of a SIG_USR2

	add script 'sc_zoneload' to load a BIND or 'dig' zone file
	into the database.

0.35  NOT RELEASED -- distributed for testing, changes included above

0.34  Tue Jun  8 16:29:39 PDT 2004
	updated rc.bdbaccess v0.06 and rc.dnsbls v0.10 to fix bug for
	perl v5.8.3 where unshift does not work properly for default @_

	update sc_recoverdb.pl v1.01 to remove environment on an update

0.33  NOT RELEASED
	updated SMTPsend.pm v0.03 to properly include To: and From: headers
	instead of depending on the MTA to provide them. This is necessary
	so that spamassassian does not flag messages as spam. and... I
	overlooked it.

	updated ScriptSupport.pm v0.22 to check mode, uid, gid of one of 
	the db files to use for restoring db environment files.

	added utility sc_recoverdb.pl + documentation

0.32  Wed May 26 12:21:37 PDT 2004
	corrected a code typo in ScriptSupport.pm v0.21 that returned an undef 
	instead of the value expected -- not noticed because the expected 
	return was "false"

	updated internal call in ParseMessage.pm v0.06 sub _host2ip, to return
	255.255.255.255 for hosts where the gethostbyname lookup fails.
	This allows this forces all unknown hosts to fail certain test
	instead of matching a ''.

0.31  Sat May 22 10:45:37 PDT 2004
	updated DNSBLserver and BDBaccess packages to remove
	compiler dependent bug when extracting the C version 
	from the primary *.PM file

0.30  Mon May 10 19:34:54 PDT 2004
	update ScriptSupport v0.20 'BLpreen' to check the
	age of each tarpit entry and not bother to check
	blcontrib entries that are older than 5x the CRON interval
	for the BLpreen job. Last preen time is stored in the
	mandatory 127.0.0.2 entry in the 'tarpit' database

	Add the entry 'FORCE_PREEN' to the sc_BLacklist.conf file
	to force the old behavior.

	DNSBLserver v0.24, modified rc.dnsbls so that tarpit records
	forceably added from the config file (such at 127.0.0.2, 
	127.0.0.3, etc...) are tested first for existence and NOT 
	added if they already exist. This preserves the data (time tag) 
	on these records so that they can be used by other routines -- 
	noteably, 127.0.0.2 which should always be present is used by 
	sc_BLpreen.pl to determine it's own cron interval

0.29  Sat May  1 15:37:43 PDT 2004
	Moved Mail::SpamCannibal::PidUtil to Proc::PidUtil
	PidUtil remains but imports all its functions from
	the new module

	correct documentation error in WhoisIP.pm

	add favicon.ico update top.incl
	add warning popup to cannibal.cgi for 
	admin login session expiration

	v0.15 and DNSBLserver.pm v0.23

0.28  Sat Feb 21 11:42:10 PST 2004
	add db write cacheing to BLpreen in ScriptSupport v0.18 
	to reduce disk thrashing and speed preening process

	correct cannibal.cgi v1.18 to display truncated character
	after hotlink for IP address in secondary db display

0.27  Mon Feb  9 16:20:27 PST 2004
	Re-write 'restart' routines for:
	DNSBLserver/rc.dnsbls v0.8
	BDBaccess/rc.bdbaccess v0.5
	scripts/rc.sc_lbdaemon v1.04

	Change wording in cannibal.cgi v1.17 for LOOKUP warning to:
	Automated lookups not allowed, click SUBMIT to continue.

	Add 'lookup' link to 'Whois' page in 
	cannibal.cgi v1.16, whois.incl v1.02

	Add script sc_country_origin.pl to analyze the number
	of IP's from a particular country in the tarpit

	Add domain name lookup to whois cannibal.cgi page
	ScriptSupport.pm
	  add dns_udpsend
	  add dns_udpresp

0.21  Wed Jan  7 11:52:56 PST 2004
	Fixed typo in howitworks.pod 'in-definite-ly', thanks to Graham Barr
	gbarr@pobox.com for spotting it.

	Added "focus" to web pages for LOOKUP, WHOIS, UPDPASSWD, SPAMADD, BLKADD

	Removed easynet.nl from the sample sc_Blacklist.conf file,
	they went out of service 12-1-03

	Removed dsbl.org from sample sc_Blacklist.conf file, this 
	was an erroneous entry.

	Update sc_Blacklist.conf to track Net::DNSBL::MultiDaemon

0.20  Fri Dec  5 17:12:31 PST 2003
	Require version 0.23 if IPTables::IPv4::DBtarpit which has
	the workaround in tarpit.c for the memory leak in libnet.

0.19  Sat Nov  8 18:45:03 PST 2003
	update public_html/cannibal.cgi so that javascript will
	insert the IP address into automated attempts for whois 
	and lookup page request actions.

	Add support to Whois and Lookup for country code and flag 
	display if the optional Geo::xxx modules are installed

0.18  Mon Oct 30 11:21:40 PDT 2003

	changed syslog call in rc.sc_dbwatch to match prototype

	update spamlst.incl, sc_session.pl, sc_remote.pl, cannibal.cgi
	to include admin capability to add CIDR/24 -31 blocks of addresses

	update public_html/index.html to behave better with robots

	add sort logic to ScriptSupport::BLcheck to check DNSBL's in
	the order of max hits to min hits and to optionally save

	squash a test bug in DNSBLserver

	modifiy sc_session.pl to access database directly for CIDR/24
	related IP lookups rather than have cannibal.cgi use BDBclient. 
	The lookup time for 255 addresses over the remote link was 
	much too long.

	add remote commands to sc_remote.pl to support insEBLK, getC24 delBLK

0.16  Fri Oct 10 13:46:42 PDT 2003

	This release contains many bug fixes as well as some new features
	in the admin interfac.
	The following modules should be updated when installing this
	release:

		IPTables::IPv4::DBTarpit verion 0.22
		Net::DNS::Codes 0.08
		Net::DNS::ToolKit 0.14
	and the optional
		LaBrea::Tarpit version 1.20
	---------------------------------------------------------------
	add "add CIDR/24 and delete CIDR24" functions to admin tools

	corrected bad use of 'clean' function in sc_session.pl
	on non-strings such as netaddrs, addresses which end in '0'
	like 1.2.3.10 are truncated by 'clean'. This function SHOULD always
	be called on real strings or numbers, not string like objects such
	as netaddrs.

	add -x expires option to sc_cleanup.pl

	add dbjob_xxx utilities to ScriptSupport.pm 0.10 for db watcher

	add missing PidUtil qw(get_script_name) to sc_mailfilter.pl

	update test suites to accomodate libdbtarpit change

	add support for DB watcher to all daemons and scripts.
	each daemon and script creates a PID file in the db environment 
	directory and NOW removes the file on clean exit. The watcher script
	periodically checks whether the files described by the pid's are
	actually running and will signal the remaining jobs to exit, 
	remove and recreate the environment and restart the jobs.

	add administrative screen shots to document package

	correct sc_web.conf.example for missing entry to 
	support admin change password

	change nav.incl a href for 'docs' to 'docs/' to 
	for the web robots. This is comsmetic since the 
	href is not used anyway, but the robots see it.

	in cannibal.cgi, modify 'whois' and 'lookup' to insert the 
	IP address into the text box when the web interface is used.
	Correct typo *gt should be &gt

	update DNSBL list in sc_BlackList.conf

0.15  Tue Sep 30 10:01:08 PDT 2003

	modify spam_report.cgi to do a better job of extracting
	URL information from the DNSBL TXT records

	add onUnLoad function to spam_report.cgi to
	close popup window in multi-site environment.
	Requires LaBrea::Tarpit::Report v 1.09

0.14  Mon Sep 29 17:18:57 PDT 2003
	Changes are to these files ONLY

	deleted public/html/whois.cgi
	Makefile.PL
	public_html/spam_report.cgi.example
		(needs LaBrea::Tarpit::Report v 1.08)
		(found in LaBrea::Tarpit 1.18)

    Makefile.PL
	fixed install for $(SPAMCANNIBAL_HOME)/public_html/tmp
	to remove directory contents after chowning so that
	web daemon does not hang after a re-installation

    spam_report.cgi.example
	corrected variable name 'usr' should be 'url' in 
	public_html/spam_report.cgi

	correct the name of the 'dbtarpit' daemon displayed
	by 'spam_report.cgi'

	eliminate 'whois.cgi' as it does not work with MSIE in
	the pop-up window. Add workaround in LaBrea::Tarpit::Report
	which must be used with this version for all to work well.
