=head1 NAME

sparkline.cgi - CGI script for generating SVG-based sparklines

=head1 VERSION

This document describes sparkline.cgi version 1.12

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    http://example.com/cgi-bin/sparkline.cgi?type=Line&values=1,2,3,4,3,2

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Since SVG sparklines are useful for display on the web, this CGI script supports
creating sparklines on the fly. The CGI returns an SVG file representing the
sparkline based on the supplied parameters.

=head1 REFERENCING THE SPARKLINE

In theory, you would be able to reference the sparkline call in an HTML C<img>
tag to display it. Unfortunately, browser support for SVG in the C<img> tag is
currently inconsistent. You can work around this by using the C<object> tag. For
example, to render a Line sparkline in an HTML page, you might use the following:

    <object type="image/svg+xml" height="12"
        data="http://anomaly.org/cgi-bin/sparkline.cgi?type=Line&sized=0&color=blue&values=10,12,9,11,14,17,20,15,13,8,5,9,13&mark=3:green&mark=high:%23f66&mark=last:%23000&thick=2&padx=4">
    </object>

=head1 QUERY PARAMETERS

=over 4

=item type

The value of this parameter specifies the type of sparkline. It must be one of
C<Area>, C<Bar>, C<Line>, C<RangeArea>, C<RangeBar>, or C<Whisker>.

=item allns

A value of 1 provides all of the xmlns attributes on the root svg element, the
default is to only supply the default SVG namespace.

=item sized

A value of 1 adds the I<height> and I<width> attributes on the root svg element. This is
currently the default behavior. A value of 0 removes thos attributes.

=item bgcolor={color}

Specify a background color for the sparkline. By default, the sparkline will
have a transparent background.

=item padx={length}

Provide {length} pixels of padding on the left and right of the sparkline.

=item pady={length}

Provide {length} pixels of padding on the top and bottom of the sparkline.

=item height={length}

Specify the height of the sparkline. The default height is 10 pixels.

=item width={length}

Specify the width of the sparkling in pixels. The default width depends on the
sparkline type and the number of data values.

=item values={comma separated list of values}

Specify the parameters to display on the sparkline. These values can take one
of three forms.

=over 4

=item All but RangeArea and RangeBar

Almost all sparkline types support the default data format which is a series
of numbers separated by commas. The C<Whisker> type has limits on the values
allowed. Other than that, all specified types work the same way.

  values=1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9

=item Whisker

The C<Whisker> sparkline type supports another format which is more condensed.
This is a series of '+', '-', and '0' characters that represent the high, low,
and neutral ticks on the Whisker graph.

   values=+--+-0+---+++

=item RangeArea and RangeBar

These two sparkline types require a pair of data values for each point on the
sparkline. To accomplish this, we comma-separated list of pairs of values. Each
pair consists of two values separated by a colon, with the smaller value first.

   values=1:1,2:4,3:9,4:16,5:25

=back

=item mark={mark}

This parameter can be supplied multiple times to define multiple marks. Each mark
has an index value and a color separated by a colon (or equals). The index value
can be either a numeric index or one of the named indexes described in
L<SVG::Sparkline::Manual> under I<mark>.

=item color={color}

Specify the color of the data line.

=item xscale={length}

Specify the distance between individual data points in the absence of a
a I<width>. If neither I<width> or I<xscale> are supplied, the default
is 2.

=item thick={length}

Thickness of the line for those sparklines that have lines. For a Bar or
RangeBar sparkline, this specifies the thickness of the bar.

=item gap={length}

Gap between the bars of the Bar sparkline or the whiskers of the
Whisker sparkline.

=back

=head1 ON COLORS

When specifying colors for any part of a sparkline, you can use any of the color
formats allowed by the SVG recommendation. However, the hexadecimal form poses a
problem when used with a CGI script. The C<#> preceding the hexadecimal string
must be URL-encoded as C<%23>, otherwise it truncates the URL.

With that caveat, the all color forms listed in
L<SVG::Sparkline::Cookbook/"How do I specify a color for the data, background, or marks?">
are supported.

=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

The error messages that this script can generate are documented in the
various C<SVG::Sparkline> modules. Each is returned with a status code
of 400. The error message is returned as HTML content.

=head1 CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT

Although it should be obvious, it is important that the modules that this
script depends on are available to the webserver and user the CGI will be
run as. Otherwise, the program will not execute.

=head1 HOSTED ENVIRONMENT

If you need to run the script in a hosted environment, you may not be able to
install the dependencies normally. The recommended approach is the use the
L<local::lib> module to configure a local Perl directory for modules the host
admin won't or can't install.

Follow the directions in the L<local::Lib> module. Then install L<SVG> and
L<SVG::Sparkline> to the local perl directories. Then add the following lines
to your copy of C<sparkline.cgi> before the other libraries.

   use lib '/home/example/perl5/lib/perl5';
   use local::lib;

Obviously, you will need to replace I</home/example/perl5> with the path created
by the L<local::lib> bootstrap process.

=head1 DEPENDENCIES

L<CGI>, L<SVG::Sparkline>, L<SVG>, and the various submodules associated
with L<SVG::Sparkline>.

=head1 BUGS AND LIMITATIONS

No bugs have been reported.
