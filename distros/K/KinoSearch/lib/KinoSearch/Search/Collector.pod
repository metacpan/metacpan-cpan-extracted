=head1 NAME

KinoSearch::Search::Collector - Process hits.

=head1 DEPRECATED

The KinoSearch code base has been assimilated by the Apache L<Lucy> project.
The "KinoSearch" namespace has been deprecated, but development continues
under our new name at our new home: L<http://lucy.apache.org/>

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    # Abstract base class.



=head1 DESCRIPTION

A Collector decides what to do with the hits that a
L<Matcher|KinoSearch::Search::Matcher> iterates through, based on how the
abstract collect() method is implemented.

Collectors operate on individual segments, but must operate within the
context of a larger collection.  Each time the collector moves to a new
segment, set_reader(), set_base() and set_matcher() will be called, and the
collector must take the updated information into account.

        my %args = @_;
        $foo{$$self} = $args{foo};

    }
