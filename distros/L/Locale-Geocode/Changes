Revision history for Perl extension Locale::Geocode

1.20 - Mon Feb 9 19:10:35 CST 2009
 - add new ext_enable and ext_disable methods for selectively enabling
   or disabling only the specified subset of all supported extensions
 - add new "ust" extention for united states territories.  this
   extension is ALWAYS on unless you explicitly disable it, thus it
   retains compatibility with previous releases.
 - rewrite ext method so that the extension list is constructed in a
   more straightforward fashion.  while the behavior of the ext method
   was never fully documented, the behavior now is, for multiple flags
   for the same extension (ie, qw(usm -usm usm))), the most recent
   element in the list is the one that is honored.
