=head1 NAME

narada-diff - prepare patch from previous version to current


=head1 VERSION

This document describes narada-diff version v2.3.7


=head1 USAGE

    narada-diff


=head1 DESCRIPTION

Should be executed in Narada 1.x project root directory.

When executed, script will delete C<var/patch/CURRENT.*> files, then
detect all changes between previous and current project versions and
generate from 0 (if there are no changes) to 4 files with these names:

    var/patch/CURRENT.10.sh
    var/patch/CURRENT.20.patch
    var/patch/CURRENT.30.tgz
    var/patch/CURRENT.40.sh

You should review these files - if something is wrong, then make changes
to project and run C<narada-diff> again until you'll be happy.

Next you can manually modify these files. If you need to add some commands
to .sh files - it's better to put them into C<var/patch/PENDING.*.sh>
instead of modifying these files. But if you need to remove some changes
from these files to avoid including them into next update - it's ok.

Now, run C<narada-release> to release next update with all changes from
current C<var/patch/CURRENT.*> and C<var/patch/PENDING.*> files.

When detecting changes it take in account C<config/patch/exclude> plus
handle files in C<config/> in special way: only added and removed files
processed, changed files ignored.


=head1 CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT

Use config/patch/exclude.
Use files in var/patch/.
