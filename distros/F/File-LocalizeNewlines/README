NAME
    File::LocalizeNewlines - Localize the newlines for one or more files

DESCRIPTION
    For people that routinely work with a mixture of different platforms
    that have conflicting newline formats (mainly *NIX and Win32) there are
    a number of different situations that can result in files having their
    newlines get corrupted.

    File::LocalizeNewlines provides a mechanism for one off or bulk
    detection and conversion of these files to the newline style for the
    local platform.

    The module implements the conversion using a standard "universal line
    seperator" regex, which ensures that files with any of the different
    newlines, plus a couple of common "broken" newlines, including multiple
    different types mixed in the same file, are all converted to the local
    platform's newline style.

METHODS
  new param => value, ...
    The "new" constructor creates a new conversion object.

    By default, the conversion object will process all files and convert
    them to the local platform's newline format.

    Takes some optional parameters

    filter => File::Find::Rule
        The "filter" param allows you to provide an instantiate
        File::Find::Rule object, that will used to determine the list of
        files to check or process.

    newline => $newline
        The "newline" option allows you to provide an alternative newline
        format to the local one. The newline format should be provided as a
        literal string.

        For example, to force Win32 newlines, you would use

          my $Object = File::LocalizeNewlines->new( newline => "\015\012" );

    verbose => 1
        The "verbose" option will cause the "File::LocalizeNewlines" object
        to print status information to "STDOUT" as it runs.

    Returns a new "File::LocalizeNewlines" object.

  Find
    The "Find" accessor returns the File::Find::Rule object that will be
    used for the file search.

  newline
    The "newline" accessor returns the newline format that will be used in
    the localisation process.

  localized $file
    The "localized" method takes an argument of a single file name or file
    handle and tests it to see it is localized correctly.

    Returns true if localized correctly, false if not, or "undef" on error.

  find $dir
    The "find" method takes the path for a dir (or file) and returns a list
    of relative files names for all of the files that do not have their
    newlines correctly localized.

    Returns a list of file names, or the null list if there are no files, or
    if an incorrect path was provided.

  localize $file | $dir
    The "localize" method takes a file, file handle or directory as argument
    and localizes the newlines of the file, or all files within the
    directory (that match the filter if one was provided).

    Returns the number of files that were localized, zero if no files needed
    to be localized, or "undef" on error.
