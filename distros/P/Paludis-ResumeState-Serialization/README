NAME
    Paludis::ResumeState::Serialization - Work with resume-files generated
    by Paludis

VERSION
    version 0.01000410

SYNOPSIS
        use Paludis::ResumeState::Serialization;

        open my $fh, '<' , '/resumefile' or die;

        my $objects = Paludis::ResumeState::Serialization->deserialize({
            content => ( do { local $/ = undef;  scalar <$fh> } ),
            format => 'basic'
        });

        my $content = Paludis::ResumeState::Serialization->serialize({
            data => $object,
            format => 'basic'
        });

        # $content should == contents of resumefile.

    This class is just really a proxy serialization interface for a few of
    the varying back-ends.

    Currently only the 'basic' back-end exists, which provides basic, but
    consistent serialization support.

  FormatNames
   basic
    Defers serialization to "::Basic"

METHODS
  deserialize
        my $object = ::Serialization->deserialize({
            content => $string
            format  => FormatName
        });

    See "FormatNames"

  serialize
        my $string = ::Serialization->serialize({
            data => $object,
            format => FormatName
        });
