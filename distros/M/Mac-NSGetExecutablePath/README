NAME
    Mac::NSGetExecutablePath - Perl interface to the _NSGetExecutablePath
    darwin (OS X) system call.

VERSION
    Version 0.03

SYNOPSIS
        sub get_perl_path {
         if ($^O eq 'darwin') {
          require Cwd;
          require Mac::NSGetExecutablePath;
          return Cwd::abs_path(Mac::NSGetExecutablePath::NSGetExecutablePath());
         } else {
          return $^X;
         }
        }

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides a Perl interface to the "_NSGetExecutablePath"
    darwin system call. It will only build on darwin systems.

    Note that if you are using perl 5.16 or greater, then the value of $^X
    is already computed from the return value of "_NSGetExecutablePath",
    making this module mostly irrelevant.

FUNCTIONS
  "NSGetExecutablePath"
        my $path = NSGetExecutablePath();

    Returns a string representing the path to the current executable. This
    path may rightfully point to a symlink.

    This function may throw exceptions, see "DIAGNOSTICS" for details.

DIAGNOSTICS
  "NSGetExecutablePath() wants to return a path too large"
    This exception is thrown when "_NSGetExecutablePath" requires an
    outrageously large buffer to return the path to the current executable.

EXPORT
    The function "NSGetExecutablePath" is only exported on request, either
    individually or by the tags ':funcs' and ':all'.

DEPENDENCIES
    perl 5.6.

    A C compiler. This module may happen to build with a C++ compiler as
    well, but don't rely on it, as no guarantee is made in this regard.

    Exporter (core since perl 5), XSLoader (since 5.6.0), base (since
    5.004_05).

SEE ALSO
    dyld(3).
