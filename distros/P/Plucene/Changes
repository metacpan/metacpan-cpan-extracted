1.25 - Mon Sep  5 09:24:00 UTC 2005

  - Stop QueryParser turning 'notice' into 'NOT ice' (RT#14450)

1.24 - Wed 20 July 2005

  - use pack and unpack to read/write frq and prx files [Minty]
  - Small doc changes [Minty / TB]

1.23 - Sun 17 July 2005

  - Stop rolling our own sorting in SegmentMerger/merge_term_infos [Minty]
  - Replace sequence of read_byte() calls in SegmentReader with one
    direct call to read() [Aaron Crane]
  - add a fast clone() method to Plucene::Index::TermInfo [TB]
    - and use it in preference to copy_in() [Minty]
  - close the file at DESTROY in Input/Output Stream classes [Minty]
  - Improve POD for Document::Field [Geoff Richards]
  - minor POD fixes [Minty / TB]
  - add indexing benchmark script [TB]

1.22 - Tue Jun 28 2005

  - perl 5.8 required
  - use pack and unpack to read/write 'segments' files in SegmentInfos [TB]
  - Use string xor to find longest common string prefix in
    TermInfosWriter [Minty / Nicholas Clark]
  - switch to direct hash access in comparison methods in
    Plucene::Index::Term [Minty]
  - remove some indirection in SegmentTermEnum [TB]
  - remove Plucene::Index::FieldInfo file [TB]
  - minor speed tweaks to SegmentMergeInfo, SegmentTermPositions [TB]
  - minor speed tweaks to SegmentsTermEnum (and split out into own file) [TB]
  - remove Tie::Array::Sorted from SegmentMerger [TB/MP]

1.21 - Mon 24 Jan 2005
  - use pack and unpack to read/write FieldInfos files (.fnm). This
    breaks index compatability with Lucene, as we now use BER
    compressed integers (but we never really had index compatability
    anyway). It will also break index compatability with older versions
    of Plucene if you have documents with more than 127 fields. Hopefully
    no-one actually does. [MP / TB]
  - localise $\ in Plucene::Store::OutputStream so -l works [Chris Nandor]
  - Removed needless new() method from FieldInfo for speed [TB]
  - Speed up FieldsInfo::_add_internal [TB]
  - explicitly close lock files immediately after creating them [MP]
  - remove all remaining catfile() calls [TB]
  - tweak docs for skipping_doc() [TB]
  - lots of tiny micro-optimisations [TB]
