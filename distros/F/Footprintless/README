NAME

    Footprintless - A utility for managing systems with minimal installs

VERSION

    version 1.28

SYNOPSIS

        use Footprintless;
    
        my $footprintless = Footprintless->new();
    
        # Deploy initialize, start, and follow the log of the foo
        $footprintless->overlay('dev.foo.overlay')->initialize();
        $footprintless->service('dev.foo.service')->start();
        $footprintless->log('dev.foo.logs.app')->follow();

DESCRIPTION

    Footprintless is an automation framework with an application frontend
    for managing diverse software stacks in a consistent fashion. It
    provides a minimally invasive approach to configuration management. At
    its core, Config::Entities are used to define the whole system
    <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System>. Once defined, the entities are
    used by all of the Footprintless modules to decouple the environment
    from the action. The environment is defined by the entities used to
    create command options. Specifically:

        hostname
        ssh
        sudo_username
        username

    Each module will have its own entities structure, see them for more
    details.

ENTITIES

    An example system my consist of multiple environments, each defined in
    their own file:

        ./fooptintless
                      /entities
                               /foo
                                   /dev.pm
                                   /qa.pm
                                   /prod.pm

    Each one of them would likely be rather similar, perhaps a variation
    of:

        return {
            app => {
                deployment => {
                    'Config::Entities::inherit' => ['hostname', 'sudo_username'],
                    clean => [
                        '/opt/foo/tomcat/conf/Catalina/localhost/',
                        '/opt/foo/tomcat/temp/',
                        '/opt/foo/tomcat/webapps/',
                        '/opt/foo/tomcat/work/'
                    ],
                    resources => {
                        bar => 'com.pastdev:bar:war:1.0',
                        baz => 'com.pastdev:baz:war:1.0'
                    },
                    to_dir => '/opt/foo/tomcat/webapps'
                },
                hostname => 'app.pastdev.com',
                logs => {
                    catalina => '/opt/foo/tomcat/logs/catalina.out'
                },
                overlay => {
                    'Config::Entities::inherit' => ['hostname', 'sudo_username'],
                    base_dir => '/home/me/git/foo/base',
                    clean => [
                        '/opt/foo/tomcat/'
                    ],
                    deployment_coordinate => 'foo.dev.app.deployment',
                    key => 'T',
                    os => 'linux',
                    resolver_coordinate => 'foo.dev',
                    template_dir => '/home/me/git/foo/template',
                    to_dir => '/opt/foo/tomcat'
                },
                sudo_username => 'tomcat',
                tomcat => {
                    'Config::Entities::inherit' => ['hostname', 'sudo_username'],
                    catalina_base => '/opt/foo/tomcat',
                    http => {
                        port => 20080
                    },
                    service => {
                        'Config::Entities::inherit' => ['hostname', 'sudo_username'],
                        action => {
                            'kill' => { command_args => 'stop -force' },
                            'status' => { use_pid => 1 }
                        },
                        command => '/opt/foo/tomcat/bin/catalina.sh',
                        pid_file => '/opt/foo/tomcat/bin/.catalina.pid',
                    },
                    shutdown => {
                        port => 20005,
                        password => $properties->{'foo.dev.app.tomcat.shutdown.password'},
                    },
                    trust_store => {
                        'Config::Entities::inherit' => ['hostname', 'sudo_username'],
                        file => '/opt/foo/tomcat/certs/truststore.jks',
                        include_java_home_cacerts => 1,
                        password => $properties->{'foo.dev.app.tomcat.trust_store.password'},
                    }
                }
            }
            web => {
                hostname => 'web.pastdev.com',
                logs => {
                    error => '/var/log/httpd/error_log',
                    access => '/var/log/httpd/access_log'
                }
                sudo_username => 'apache'
            }
        }

    Then when you decide to perform an action, the environment is just part
    of the coordinate:

        fpl log foo.dev.app.tomcat.logs.catalina follow
    
        fpl service foo.qa.app.tomcat.service status
    
        fpl deployment foo.prod.app.deployment deploy --clean

    If using the framework instead, the story is the same:

        my $permission_denied = Footprintless->new()
            ->log('foo.prod.web.logs.error')
            ->grep(options => 'Permission denied');

CONSTRUCTORS

 new(\%entity, %options)

    Creates a new Footprintless factory. Available options are:

    config_dirs

      The root folder(s) for configuration entities. Defaults to the
      $FPL_CONFIG_DIRS environment variable if set, $FPL_HOME/config if
      not. config_dirs can be a scalar (one directory), or an array ref if
      there is more than one directory. If set via the $FPL_CONFIG_DIRS
      environment variable, and you need more than one directory, use a ;
      to delimit on windows, or a : to delimit on *nix (same as the $PATH
      variable).

    config_properties

      The properties file(s) used for placeholder replacement for
      configuration entities. Defaults to the $FPL_CONFIG_PROPS environment
      variable if set, $FPL_HOME/properties.pl if not. config_properties
      can be a scalar (one file), or an array ref if there is more than one
      directory. If set via the $FPL_CONFIG_PROPS environment variable, and
      you need more than one directory, use a ; to delimit on windows, or a
      : to delimit on *nix (same as the $PATH variable).

    command_options_factory

      Sets the command_options_factory for this instance. Must be an
      instance or subclass of Footprintless::CommandOptionsFactory.

    command_runner

      Footprintless::CommandRunner.

    entities

      If supplied, entities will serve as the configuration for this
      instance. All other configuration sources will be ignored. Must be
      either a hashref, or an instance of Config::Entities.

    fpl_home

      The root folder for footprintless configuration. Defaults to the
      $FPL_HOME environment variable if set, ~/.footprintless if not.

      Sets the localhost resolver for this instance. Must be an instance or
      subclass of Footprintless::Localhost.
