SWIM FUNCTIONS

    This plugin provides 2 block level functions:

    `<<<cpan-head [args]>>>

      The cpan-head function adds a name, badge and version section (in
      that order) to your document using metadata variables. By default you
      get a NAME section and a VERSION section. You get a badge section if
      your metadata has a badge key. You can specify the section names you
      want like this:

          <<<cpan-head name version>>>

      You can request a section not be used like this:

          <<<cpan-head -version>>>

    `<<<cpan-tail [args]>>>

      The cpan-tail function adds a see, author and copyright section (in
      that order) to your document using metadata variables. By default you
      get a AUTHOR section and a COPYRIGHT AND LICENSE section. You can
      request a 'SEE ALSO' section if your metadata has a see key. You can
      specify the section names you want like this:

          <<<cpan-tail see author copyright>>>

      You can request a section be added like this:

          <<<cpan-head +see>>>
