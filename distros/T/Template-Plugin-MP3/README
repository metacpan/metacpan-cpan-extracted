NAME
    Template::Plugin::MP3 - Interface to the MP3::Info Module

SYNOPSIS
        [% USE mp3 = MP3("Montana.mp3") %]

        [% mp3.title %]
        [% mp3.album %]

        # perldoc MP3::Info for more ideas

DESCRIPTION
    "Template::Plugin::MP3" provides a simple wrapper for using "MP3::Info"
    in object oriented mode; see the MP3::Info manpage for more details.

CONSTRUCTOR and CONFIGURATION
    "Template::Plugin::MP3" takes a filename as its primary argument:

        [% USE MP3("Tryin_To_Grow_A_Chin.mp3") %]

    Optional configuration info can also be specified in the constructor:

        [% USE MP3("Camarillo_Brillo.mp3", utf8 => 1, dir => "/mp3") %]

    The name of the file can also be specified as a named parameter
    ("name"):

        [% USE MP3(name => "A_Token_Of_My_Extreme.mp3", dir => "/mp3") %]

    "Template::Plugin::MP3" understands the following options:

    name    The name of the MP3 file. Note that if both a positional
            argument and a "name" parameter are passed the positional
            argument will take precedence.

    dir     Specify a base directory name; will be prepended to the
            filename, if it is defined.

    utf8    Determines whether results should be returned in UTF-8, as
            handled by "MP3::Info"'s use_mp3_utf8() function. See the
            use_mp3_utf8 entry in the MP3::Info manpage. Note that this
            requires Unicode::String.

    If the constructor cannot create an instance using the filename passed,
    a "plugin.mp3" Exception is thrown, which will need to be caught
    appropriately:

        [% TRY %]
            [% USE mp3 = MP3("Willie The Pimp.mp3") %]
        [% CATCH plugin.mp3 %]
            Can't find that MP3; are you sure you spelled it right?
        [% CATCH %]
            Unexpected exception: [% error %]
        [% END %]

METHODS
    "Template::Plugin::MP3" provides the following, mostly intuitive,
    methods:

    file            Name of the file.

    artist          Name of the artist.

    album           Name of the album.

    bitrate         Bitrate at which the mp3 was encoded.

    size            Size of the file, in bytes.

    time, secs, mm, ss, ms
                    Length of the song, in various permutations. For
                    example:

                    time    03:37

                    secs    217.0253125

                    mm      3

                    ss      27

                    ms      25.3125000000125

    genre           Genre of the MP3.

    tagversion      Full name of the version of the MP3 tag, e.g. "ID3v1.1"

    version         Version of the MP3 tag: 1 or 2

    "MP3::Info" defines some other fields that I don't grok; try

        [% MP3.Dump %]

    to see them all.

    Of course, all of the above methods don't return the advertised value if
    the tag being read does not contain useful information.

OTHER STUFF
    "Template::Plugin::MP3" provides access to the @mp3_genres and
    @winamp_genres arrays via the mp3_genres() and winamp_genres() class
    methods, or collectively through the genres() class method:

        [% FOREACH genre = MP3.genres %]
           * [% genre;
        END %]
