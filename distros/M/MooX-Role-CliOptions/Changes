0.05    2019-09-24 19:00:00
        Promoted test version 0.04.1_004 to release version 0.05

0.04.1_004 2019-09-23 22:35:00
        Added non-modulino style script to examples to verify it works
        from package 'main'. Tweaked POD. Added POD spell-check.

0.04.1_003 2019-09-23 11:11:00
        Set plan to 'skip_all' if it appears that the spawned child process
        fails to run the example script properly. This appears to happen on
        several test platforms even though required modules are specified in
        Makefile.PL.

0.04.1_002 2019-09-22 23:45:00
        Added TEST_REQUIRES to Makefile.PL after see test failures indicating
        that Moo was not available.

0.04.1_001 2019-09-22 23:40:00
        Re-instated tests for moodulino.pl back after adding additional tests
        to help diagnose why they fail on some platforms. Do NOT merge this
        branch to master until that is solved.

0.04    2019-09-21 21:53:00
        Removed tests for moodulino.pl since they do not test the Role
        itself and system() behaves erratically on some systems.

0.03.1_001 2019-09-21 20:13:00
        Added Test::MockModule to build requirements. Investigating test
        failures with system() on some platforms.
