0.004     2012-01-02 09:13:04 Europe/London
	Support DevInf 1.1, and a test to go through the samples/wbxml/*.wbxml
	files to check whether we can extract the basic metadata (still need tests
	for XML->WBXML->XML roundtrip handling).

0.003     2012-01-02 08:55:04 Europe/London
	SyncML 1.1 DTD support, and handle strtable lookups for character data.

	Added some missing public IDs, several fixes around element and
	attribute parsing, implemented initial termstr method for terminated
	strings (incorrectly assumes \0 terminator but this is 'good enough'
	for utf8 documents).

	Initial CPAN release.
