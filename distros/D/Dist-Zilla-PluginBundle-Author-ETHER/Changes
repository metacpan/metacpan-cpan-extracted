          - always report installed version of Module::Runtime in

          - add new xt/author/changes_has_content.t that calls

          - bump minimum required version of [Test::MinimumVersion], to get

          - new 'plugin_prereq_phase' and 'plugin_prereq_relationship'
            configuration options, which control whether and how to inject
            plugins used by this bundle into distribution prerequisites
          - plugins used in the distribution build are now injected into
            x_Dist_Zilla/requires by default, rather than develop/suggests

          - plugins used by the bundle are now injected into develop-suggests

          - fix a new test to avoid triggering the "looks like you're
            installing from cpan, rather than building a distribution in the
            repository" heuristic when using Dist::Zilla (e.g. on older perls)

0.128     2017-08-16 23:39:44Z
          - version extraction and updating plugins now fully extracted out

          - added [CheckMetaResources]

0.119     2016-09-04 22:48:25Z
          - Module::Metadata is no longer used as a test prereq (via
            [Test::ReportPrereqs]) if ExtUtils::MakeMaker is the sole

            with loaded modules
          - copy_file_from_release option now appends to, rather than

            [MakeMaker] version 5.020

            (github) CPAN-API/metacpan-web#1270 instead.
          - order contributors by number of commits, descending
          - no longer adding an $AUTHORITY variable to modules, as nothing
            (save Class::MOP, Moose and Moo) has ever used it - this also

            release, so it never shows up in the shipped dist
          - include a default .mailmap in the minted dist; invite the user to
            update .mailmap if the contributor data is not quite right
          - avoid errors from in XS-based distributions where a token Makefile.PL
            is included and we try to generate our own over top
          - more directories added to no_index
          - now instead of installing release with [InstallRelease], switch to
            [Run::AfterRelease] with an author-specific PAUSE URL, to help out
            cpanm-reporter
          - adjust the command that updates the .latest symlink, to account
            for @#$!@#$ incompatibilities between implementations of `ln`

          - internally-hardcoded extra arguments to be passed to optional

          - minimum perl version really really fixed now
          - drop [Test::UnusedVars] - too many false positives; perl-critic is
            better suited to address these sorts of issues
          - Makefile.PL now checks for 'git' command, so we can get NA reports
            for every smoker that tried to look at us (before attempting to

            distributions (still at 5.013002)

0.050     2014-02-13 17:39:49Z

            Config::MVP::Assembler::WithBundles::_add_bundle_contents

0.047     2014-01-14 05:34:39Z
          - adjusted plugin order so [PkgVersion] gets a chance to insert into
            the first blank line of the package (new in 5.010) before other
            modules insert their code lines
          - pod removed from in the middle of source is now replaced with a
            commented-out version of itself, to avoid altering line numbers

          - ensure that .pod files are also eligible for indexing
          - minting profile switched to using a dist sharedir to store

          - disable invocation of cpanm-reporter (see RT#88367)

            report

0.019     2013-08-21 19:16:27Z
          - now supporting dists hosted elsewhere than github (currently
            gitmo, p5sagit, or other), via the 'server' option
          - Test::Version now runs in strict mode
          - generated clean-namespaces.t test now skips ::Conflicts module
          - [Test::Kwalitee] now included in bundle, rather than adding it
            into the minted dist.ini separately

0.018     2013-08-16 05:11:06Z
          - now using [PromptIfStale] to ensure the plugin bundle is always
            the latest version, and all plugins are checked at release time
          - bring back [Test::CPAN::Changes], now that the spec has become a
            bit more reasonable (removed since v0.015)
          - Changes entries are now made with times in UTC, with a trailing
            'Z' rather than the CLDR 'ZZZZ' format code

          - update minimum version of perl required, re syntax used in
            templates applied during minting
          - inject a forced dependency on a fixed CPAN::Meta::Check

          - added basic tests for the pluginbundle and minter
          - clean up .ackrc editing at build time

0.015     2013-08-01 23:02:32Z
          - [Test::CPAN::Changes] omitted if its version >= 0.21, pending
            resolution of too-strict datetime formats (e.g. RT#87499)

          - injected compile test now also checks files in examples/

            compatibility with Module::Build::Tiny

0.013     2013-07-28 23:59:41Z
          - inserts --ignore-dir line into .ackrc at build time
          - when releasing this pluginbundle, dist.ini is edited (and
            committed) to force a dependency on the newly-released version, and
            all other local dist.inis using this bundle are also edited
            (without committing)
          - issue tracking is disabled in newly-created github repositories

0.012     2013-07-17 01:32:35Z
          - do not require trial versions of [Test::Compile], allowing
            flexibility as which we choose to build with

0.011     2013-07-06 00:59:57Z
          - compile test will also check for warnings, when author is testing

0.009     2013-06-20 17:18:12Z
          - 'installer' now defaults to ModuleBuildTiny
          - (experimental) namespaces-are-clean release test added to minting
            profile, although this won't pass for many types of dists as many
            things are sloppy about modifying the package stash

0.008     2013-06-11 22:59:23Z
          - fix bad templating in minted module
          - during minting, push the initial commit to github after creating
            the remote

0.007     2013-05-30 01:48:34Z
          - minting profile updates:
            - extra kwalitee tests enabled by default
            - test now has 'use <main module>;', prefers done_testing,
              and now fails, rather than not compiling
            - main module now avoids the list transformer where it breaks pod
              coverage tests; includes more template pod
          - config option added for changing the installer backend (still
            defaults to MakeMaker, for now)

0.006     2013-05-11 00:06:41Z
          - support dropped for directly passing stopwords via a mvp argument
            -- it's easier to just use a directive right in pod (and they can
            be added via ConfigSlicer too, if needed)
          - minting process now prompts to create a repository on github
          - alter max_target_perl setting for *this dist itself only* to
            commit to run on 5.16.3+, not 5.8.8+
          - the version of Dist::Zilla used to build this distribution is
            injected as a develop prerequisite for users of the plugin bundle
          - the version of this bundle used to mint a dist is set as the
            minimum version for subsequent builds of the dist
          - after release, the github repository is updated with the
            distribution's abstract as its description, and the metacpan page
            as its homepage.

0.005     2013-04-28 15:47:40Z
          - bump version for [Test::Compile] and [Test::CheckDeps] (RT#84900,

0.004     2013-04-27 03:56:11Z
          - fix missing .gitignore in minted dists
          - [-Encoding] podweaver plugin added to this distribution and
            minted dists
          - extra stopwords added, after disabling my local aspell dictionary
          - Pod::Weaver plugins used in this bundle are added as runtime
            prerequisites

0.003     2013-04-21 17:22:48Z

            Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Test::CPAN::Changes
          - document the multiple mechanisms for adding stopwords (and add the
            [-Stopwords] weaver plugin, which seems to be needed sometimes)

0.002     2013-04-14 22:40:08Z
          - do not index our profiles/, to avoid its contents from showing up
            under "Documentation" on metacpan
          - users of [@Author::ETHER] can now -remove plugins

0.001     2013-04-14 20:52:50Z
          - Initial release, incorporating the minting profile that I had been
            using locally in ~/.dzil/profiles/github.
