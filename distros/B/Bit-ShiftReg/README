Legal stuff:
------------

Copyright (c) 1997 by Steffen Beyer. All rights reserved.
This package is free software; you can redistribute it
and/or modify it under the same terms as Perl itself.


Requirements:
-------------

Perl version 5.000 or higher, a C compiler capable of the ANSI C standard (!)
                              ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


What does it do:
----------------

This module implements rotate left, rotate right, arithmetic shift left
and logical shift right operations with carry flag for all C integer types.

The results depend on the number of bits that the integer types unsigned
char, unsigned short, unsigned int and unsigned long have on your machine.

The module automatically determines the number of bits of each integer type
and adjusts its internal constants accordingly.


Preliminary steps for use with Perl prior to version 5.002:
-----------------------------------------------------------

Edit the file "Makefile.PL" in this distribution and change the line

    'VERSION_FROM'	=> 'ShiftReg.pm',

to

    'VERSION'		=> '2.0',

Then edit the file "ShiftReg.pm" and change the line

    bootstrap Bit::ShiftReg $VERSION;

to

    bootstrap Bit::ShiftReg;

Finally, edit the file "ShiftReg.xs" and delete the line

    PROTOTYPES: DISABLE


How to install it:
------------------

Please unpack and build this package OUTSIDE the Perl source and distribution
tree!!

 1) Change directory to the directory that has been created by unpacking this
    package ("Bit-ShiftReg-2.0/").

 2) Type "perl Makefile.PL" (or whatever the name and path of your Perl 5
    binary is).

    This will create a "Makefile" with the appropriate parameters for your
    system (for instance, where the install directories are, and so on).

 3) Type "make".

    This will create a dynamically linkable library file that will be linked
    to Perl later, at runtime, provided your system supports dynamic linking.

    Please refer to the MakeMaker documentation for instructions on how
    to build a new Perl with statically linked libraries (invoke "perldoc
    ExtUtils::MakeMaker" for this), if your system does NOT support dynamic
    linking!

    Should you encounter any compiler warnings or errors (like the redefini-
    tion of certain types already defined by your system), please contact
    me by mail at <sb@sdm.de>, sending me your compiler output (both STDOUT
    and STDERR). Thank you!

    ======================================================================
    Be aware that you need a C compiler which supports ANSI C in order to
    successfully compile this package!
    ======================================================================

    Also note that problems may arise with the c89 compiler of HP, although
    it allegedly supports ANSI C!

    I recommend the GNU gcc compiler, which is available for free on the
    Internet.

    (HP users are strongly recommended to install the GNU assembler GAS
    first before installing GNU gcc)

    Should you get the error messages

    ShiftReg.c: 15: Unable to find include file 'EXTERN.h'.
    ShiftReg.c: 16: Unable to find include file 'perl.h'.
    ShiftReg.c: 17: Unable to find include file 'XSUB.h'.

    then edit the file Makefile.PL and change the line

    'INC'	=> '',     # e.g., '-I/opt/pkg/perl5.003/dist'

    in such a way that it points to your Perl 5 distribution tree, e.g.,

    'INC'	=> '-I/usr/ctr/dlt/private/perl/perl5.003',

    or the like, and start over with the generation of the Makefile at 2).

 4) Now issue "make test".

    The output should look somewhat like this:

    PERL_DL_NONLAZY=1 /usr/bin/perl -I./blib/arch -I./blib/lib
    -I/e/www/sw/pkg/perl/lib/i386-freebsd/5.003 -I/e/www/sw/pkg/perl/lib
    -e 'use Test::Harness qw(&runtests $verbose); $verbose=0; runtests @ARGV;'
    t/*.t
    t/f000..............ok
    t/f001..............ok
    t/f002..............ok
    t/f003..............ok
    t/f004..............ok
    t/f005..............ok
    t/f006..............ok
    t/f007..............ok
    All tests successful.
    Files=8,  Tests=234,  1 secs ( 1.40 cusr  0.23 csys =  1.63 cpu)

 5) At last, type "make install".

 6) Share and enjoy!


Version history:
----------------

Version 1.0 was the initial release.

Version 1.1 fixed a possible bug in the XS file where the number of bits
of an unsigned char was assumed to be 8 bits (without even checking) in
the previous version.

Version 2.0 provides new "MSB" and "LSB" functions (for all types).

This version also changed the module's name from "ROL_ROR" to "Bit::ShiftReg".

It also provides testing routines so that "make test" now works.

And last but not least this version changed the interfaces of the existing
functions so that they can be chained to form ever larger shift registers.
