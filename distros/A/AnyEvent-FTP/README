NAME

    AnyEvent::FTP - Simple asynchronous FTP client and server

VERSION

    version 0.09

SYNOPSIS

     # For the client
     use AnyEvent::FTP::Client;
    
     # For the server
     use AnyEvent::FTP::Server;

DESCRIPTION

    This distribution provides client and server implementations for File
    Transfer Protocol (FTP) in an AnyEvent environment. For the specific
    interfaces, see AnyEvent::FTP::Client and AnyEvent::FTP::Server for
    details.

    Before each release, AnyEvent::FTP::Client is tested against these FTP
    servers using the t/client_*.t tests that come with this distribution:

    Proftpd

    wu-ftpd

    Net::FTPServer

    vsftpd

    Pure-FTPd

    bftpd

    AnyEvent::FTP::Server

    The client code is also tested less frequently against these FTP
    servers:

    NcFTPd

    Microsoft IIS

    It used to also be tested against the VMS ftp server, so it was
    verified to work with it, at least at one point. However, I no longer
    have access to that server.
