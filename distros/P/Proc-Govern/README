NAME
    Proc::Govern - Run child process and govern its various aspects

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.200 of Proc::Govern (from Perl
    distribution Proc-Govern), released on 2018-01-31.

SYNOPSIS
    To use via command-line (in most cases):

     % govproc \
           --timeout 3600 \
           --log-stderr-dir        /var/log/myapp/ \
           --log-stderr-size       16M \
           --log-stderr-histories  12 \
       /path/to/myapp

    To use directly as Perl module:

     use Proc::Govern qw(govern_process);
     govern_process(
         name       => 'myapp',
         command    => ['/path/to/myapp', 'some', 'args'],
         timeout    => 3600,
         log_stderr => {
             dir       => '/var/log/myapp',
             size      => '16M',
             histories => 12,
         },
     );

DESCRIPTION
    Proc::Govern is a child process manager. It is meant to be a convenient
    bundle (a single parent/monitoring process) for functionalities commonly
    needed when managing a child process. It comes with a command-line
    interface, govproc.

    Background story: I first created this module to record STDERR output of
    scripts that I run from cron. The scripts already log debugging
    information using Log::Any to an autorotated log file (using
    Log::Dispatch::FileRotate, via Log::Any::Adapter::Log4perl, via
    Log::Any::App). However, when the scripts warn/die, or when the programs
    that the scripts execute emit messages to STDERR, they do not get
    recorded. Thus, every script is then run through govproc. From there,
    govproc naturally gets additional features like timeout, preventing
    running multiple instances, and so on.

    Currently the following governing functionalities are available:

    *   logging of STDOUT & STDERR output to an autorotated file

    *   execution time limit

    *   preventing multiple instances from running simultaneously

    *   load watch

    *   autorestart

    In the future the following features are also planned or contemplated:

    *   CPU time limit

    *   memory limit

        With an option to autorestart if process' memory size grow out of
        limit.

    *   other resource usage limit

    *   fork/start multiple processes

    *   set (CPU) nice level

    *   set I/O nice level (scheduling priority/class)

    *   limit STDIN input, STDOUT/STDERR output?

    *   trap/handle some signals for the child process?

    *   set UID/GID?

    *   provide daemon functionality?

    *   provide network server functionality?

        Inspiration: djb's tcpserver.

    *   set/clean environment variables

EXIT CODES
    Below is the list of exit codes that Proc::Govern uses:

    *   124

        Timeout. The exit code is also used by timeout.

    *   202

        Another instance is already running (when "single_instance" option
        is true).

CAVEATS
    Not yet tested on Win32.

FUNCTIONS
  govern_process
    Usage:

     govern_process(%args) -> int

    Run child process and govern its various aspects.

    It basically uses IPC::Run and a loop to check various conditions during
    the lifetime of the child process.

    TODO: restart_delay, check_alive.

    This function is not exported by default, but exportable.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   command* => *array[str]*

        Command to run.

        Passed to IPC::Run's "start()".

    *   killfam => *bool*

        Instead of kill, use killfam (kill family of process).

        This can be useful e.g. to control load more successfully, if the
        load-generating processes are the subchildren of the one we're
        governing.

        This requires Proc::Killfam CPAN module, which is installed
        separately.

    *   load_check_every => *duration* (default: 10)

        Frequency of load checking.

    *   load_high_limit => *int|code*

        Limit above which program should be suspended, if load watching is
        enabled. If integer, will be compared against Unix::Uptime"->load"'s
        $load1 value. Alternatively, you can provide a custom routine here,
        code should return true if load is considered too high.

    *   load_low_limit => *int|code*

        Limit below which program should resume, if load watching is
        enabled. If integer, will be compared against Unix::Uptime"->load"'s
        $load1 value. Alternatively, you can provide a custom routine here,
        code should return true if load is considered low.

    *   load_watch => *bool* (default: 0)

        If set to 1, enable load watching. Program will be suspended when
        system load is too high and resumed if system load returns to a
        lower limit.

    *   log_stderr => *hash*

        Will be passed as arguments to `File::Write::Rotate`.

        Specify logging for STDERR. Logging will be done using
        File::Write::Rotate. Known hash keys: "dir" (STR, defaults to
        "/var/log", directory, preferably absolute, where the log file(s)
        will reside, should already exist and be writable, will be passed to
        File::Write::Rotate's constructor), "size" (int, also passed to
        File::Write::Rotate's constructor), "histories" (int, also passed to
        File::Write::Rotate's constructor), "period" (str, also passed to
        File::Write::Rotate's constructor).

    *   log_stdout => *hash*

        Will be passed as arguments to `File::Write::Rotate`.

    *   name => *str*

        Should match regex "\A\w+\z". Used in several places, e.g. passed as
        "prefix" in File::Write::Rotate's constructor as well as used as
        name of PID file.

        If not given, will be taken from command.

    *   no_screensaver => *bool*

        Prevent screensaver from being activated.

    *   on_multiple_instance => *str*

        Can be set to "exit" to silently exit when there is already a
        running instance. Otherwise, will print an error message "Program
        <NAME> already running".

    *   pid_dir => *str*

        Directory to put PID file in.

    *   restart => *bool* (default: 1)

        If set to true, do restart.

    *   show_stderr => *bool* (default: 1)

        Can be used to turn off STDERR output. If you turn this off and set
        "log_stderr", STDERR output will still be logged but not displayed
        to screen.

    *   show_stdout => *bool* (default: 1)

        Just like `show_stderr`, but for STDOUT.

    *   single_instance => *bool* (default: 0)

        If set to true, will prevent running multiple instances
        simultaneously. Implemented using Proc::PID::File. You will also
        normally have to set "pid_dir", unless your script runs as root, in
        which case you can use the default "/var/run".

    *   timeout => *int*

        Apply execution time limit, in seconds.

        After this time is reached, process (and all its descendants) are
        first sent the TERM signal. If after 30 seconds pass some processes
        still survive, they are sent the KILL signal.

        The killing is implemented using IPC::Run's "kill_kill()".

        Upon timeout, exit code is set to 124.

    Return value: Child's exit code (int)

FAQ
  Why use Proc::Govern?
    The main feature this module offers is convenience: it creates a single
    parent process to monitor child process. This fact is more pronounced
    when you need to monitor lots of child processes. If you use, on the
    other hand, separate parent/monitoring process for timeout and then a
    separate one for CPU watching, and so on, there will potentially be a
    lot more processes running on the system. Compare for example:

     % govproc --timeout 10 --load-watch CMD

    which only creates one monitoring process, versus:

     % timeout 10s loadwatch CMD

    which will create two parent processes (three actually, loadwatch
    apparently forks first).

ENVIRONMENT
  DEBUG => bool
    If set to true, will display debugging output to STDERR, e.g. when
    stopping/starting a process.

SEE ALSO
    Proc::Govern uses IPC::Run at its core.

    IPC::Cmd also uses IPC::Run (as well as IPC::Open3 on systems that do
    not have IPC::Run installed or on some archaic systems that do not
    support IPC::Run) and its "run_forked()" routine also has some of
    Proc::Govern's functionalities like capturing stdout and stderr,
    timeout, hiding (discarding) output. If you only need those
    functionalities, you can use IPC::Cmd as it is a core module.

    Proc::Govern attempts (or will attempt, some day) to provide the
    functionality (or some of the functionality) of the
    builtins/modules/programs listed below:

    *   Starting/autorestarting

        djb's supervise, http://cr.yp.to/daemontools/supervise.html

    *   Pausing under high system load

        loadwatch. This program also has the ability to run N copies of
        program and interactively control stopping/resuming via Unix socket.

        cPanel also includes a program called cpuwatch.

    *   Preventing multiple instances of program running simultaneously

        Proc::PID::File, Sys::RunAlone

    *   Execution time limit

        timeout.

        alarm() (but alarm() cannot be used to timeout external programs
        started by system()/backtick).

        Sys::RunUntil

    *   Logging

        djb's multilog, http://cr.yp.to/daemontools/multilog.html

    Although not really related, Perinci::Sub::Wrapper. This module also
    bundles functionalities like timeout, retries, argument validation, etc
    into a single function wrapper.
