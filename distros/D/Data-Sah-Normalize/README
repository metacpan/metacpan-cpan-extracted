NAME
    Data::Sah::Normalize - Normalize Sah schema

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.050 of Data::Sah::Normalize (from Perl
    distribution Data-Sah-Normalize), released on 2018-09-10.

SYNOPSIS
     use Data::Sah::Normalize qw(normalize_clset normalize_schema);

     my $nclset = normalize_clset({'!a'=>1}); # -> {a=>1, 'a.op'=>'not'}
     my $nsch   = normalize_schema("int");    # -> ["int", {}, {}]

DESCRIPTION
    This often-needed functionality is split from the main Data::Sah to keep
    it in a small and minimal-dependencies package.

FUNCTIONS
  normalize_clset($clset) => HASH
    Normalize a clause set (hash). Return a shallow copy of the original
    hash. Die on failure.

    TODO: option to recursively normalize clause which contains sah clauses
    (e.g. "of").

  normalize_schema($sch) => ARRAY
    Normalize a Sah schema (scalar or array). Return an array. Produce a
    2-level copy of schema, so it's safe to add/delete/modify the normalized
    schema's clause set and extras (but clause set's and extras' values are
    still references to the original). Die on failure.

    TODO: recursively normalize clause which contains sah clauses (e.g.
    "of").
