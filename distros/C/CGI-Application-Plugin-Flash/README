CGI-Application-Plugin-Flash

This CGI::Application plugin wraps the CGI::Session::Flash module to
implement a Flash object.  A flash is session data with a specific life cycle.
When you put something into the flash it stays then until the end of the next
request.  This allows you to use it for storing messages that can be accessed
after a redirect, but then are automatically cleaned up.
