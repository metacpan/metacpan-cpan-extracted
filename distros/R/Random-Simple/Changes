0.26 2025-12-14
	- Lowered warmup rounds to 32
	- Require Perl v5.14
	- Better automatic seeding (less overhead)
	- `rand()` should be more accurate on 32bit systems
	- Make `random_float()` inclusive for real this time
	- Use pcg64 (RXS-M-XS) for `rand64()` calls instead of chaining 2x 32bit calls

0.24 2025-03-31
	- Add `shuffle_array()` function
	- Minor fixes for Win32 seeding

0.22 2025-02-04
	- BUGFIX: rand_float() on 32bit platforms was broken

0.20 2025-02-03
	- Calculate random floating point without bias
	- Use a better hashing function for srand()

0.18 2025-01-15
	- Drop `nanos()` for seeding because it isn't well supported on Windows
	- Document how to manually seed the PRNG
	- Add wrapper around srand()
	- Add random_elem(@arr)

0.17 2025-01-12
	- Add back in the unit tests

0.16 2025-01-08
	- Better document code
	- Catch if somehow our seeds are both zero
	- Log the random seeds used in the unit tests
	- Break all the random methods into their own test file
	- Use two different PCG32 generators to make 64 bit values

0.15 2024-12-11
	- Require Win32::API for Windows builds
	- Update POD documentation with correct bug reporting location
	- Minor perlcritic fixes

0.14 2024-11-28
	- Better documentation of individual functions
	- POD is more consistent with other Perl modules
	- BUGFIX: rand() is no longer inclusive
	- BUGFIX: random_float() uses the full range now (we were off by one)

0.12 2024-11-28
	- Simplify unit testing for ranges
	- Triply verify we are getting enough entropy from the OS
	- Uprgrade/override rand() to use a good PRNG
	- More efficient seeding

0.11 2024-11-19
	- Use grep instead of any because it is more supported
	- Fix some color output
	- Only run 64bit test on 64bit platforms

0.10 2024-11-17
	- Add random_float()
	- Bump the warmup to 1024 iterations because it is fast
	- Much improved unit testing
	- Cleaner XS linking code
	- Properly use CryptGenRandom on Windows
	- Error out if we cannot read /dev/urandom or CryptGenRandom so there is no chance of bad seeds

0.5 2024-11-12
	- Support for older Perls back to v5.12
	- Better support for 32bit Perls
