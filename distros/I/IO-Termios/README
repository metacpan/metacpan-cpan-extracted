NAME

    IO::Termios - supply termios(3) methods to IO::Handle objects

SYNOPSIS

     use IO::Termios;
    
     my $term = IO::Termios->open( "/dev/ttyS0", "9600,8,n,1" )
        or die "Cannot open ttyS0 - $!";
    
     $term->print( "Hello world\n" ); # Still an IO::Handle
    
     while( <$term> ) {
        print "A line from ttyS0: $_";
     }

DESCRIPTION

    This class extends the generic IO::Handle object class by providing
    methods which access the system's terminal control termios(3)
    operations. These methods are primarily of interest when dealing with
    TTY devices, including serial ports.

    The flag-setting methods will apply to any TTY device, such as a
    pseudo-tty, and are useful for controlling such flags as the ECHO flag,
    to disable local echo.

     my $stdin = IO::Termios->new( \*STDIN );
     $stdin->setflag_echo( 0 );

    When dealing with a serial port the line mode method is useful for
    setting the basic serial parameters such as baud rate, and the modem
    line control methods can be used to access the hardware handshaking
    lines.

     my $ttyS0 = IO::Termios->open( "/dev/ttyS0" );
     $ttyS0->set_mode( "19200,8,n,1" );
     $ttyS0->set_modem({ dsr => 1, cts => 1 });

 Arbitrary Baud Rates on Linux

    Linux supports a non-POSIX extension to the usual termios interface,
    which allows arbitrary baud rates to be set. IO::Termios can
    automatically make use of this ability if the Linux::Termios2 module is
    installed. If so, this will be used automatically and transparently, to
    allow the set*baud methods to set any rate allowed by the
    kernel/driver. If not, then only the POSIX-compatible rates may be
    used.

CONSTRUCTORS

 new

       $term = IO::Termios->new()

    Construct a new IO::Termios object around the terminal for the program.
    This is found by checking if any of STDIN, STDOUT or STDERR are a
    terminal. The first one that's found is used. An error occurs if no
    terminal can be found by this method.

 new (handle)

       $term = IO::Termios->new( $handle )

    Construct a new IO::Termios object around the given filehandle.

 open

       $term = IO::Termios->open( $path, $modestr )

    Open the given path, and return a new IO::Termios object around the
    filehandle. If the open call fails, undef is returned.

    If $modestr is provided, the constructor will pass it to the set_mode
    method before returning.

METHODS

 getattr

       $attrs = $term->getattr

    Makes a tcgetattr() call on the underlying filehandle, and returns a
    IO::Termios::Attrs object.

    If the tcgetattr() call fails, undef is returned.

 setattr

       $term->setattr( $attrs )

    Makes a tcsetattr() call on the underlying file handle, setting
    attributes from the given IO::Termios::Attrs object.

    If the tcsetattr() call fails, undef is returned. Otherwise, a true
    value is returned.

 set_mode

 get_mode

       $term->set_mode( $modestr )
    
       $modestr = $term->get_mode

    Accessor for the derived "mode string", which is a comma-joined
    concatenation of the baud rate, character size, parity mode, and stop
    size in a format such as

     19200,8,n,1

    When setting the mode string, trailing components may be omitted
    meaning their value will not be affected.

 tiocmget

 tiocmset

       $bits = $term->tiocmget
    
       $term->tiocmset( $bits )

    Accessor for the modem line control bits. Takes or returns a bitmask of
    values.

 tiocmbic

 tiocmbis

       $term->tiocmbic( $bits )
    
       $term->tiocmbis( $bits )

    Bitwise mutator methods for the modem line control bits. tiocmbic will
    clear just the bits provided and leave the others unchanged; tiocmbis
    will set them.

 get_modem

       $flags = $term->get_modem

    Returns a hash reference containing named flags corresponding to the
    modem line control bits. Any bit that is set will yield a key in the
    returned hash of the same name. The bit names are

     dtr dsr rts cts cd ri

 set_modem

       $term->set_modem( $flags )

    Changes the modem line control bit flags as given by the hash
    reference. Each bit to be changed should be represented by a key in the
    $flags hash of the names given above. False values will be cleared,
    true values will be set. Other flags will not be altered.

 getmodem_BIT

 setmodem_BIT

       $set = $term->getmodem_BIT
    
       $term->setmodem_BIT( $set )

    Accessor methods for each of the modem line control bits. A set of
    methods exists for each of the named modem control bits given above.

FLAG-ACCESSOR METHODS

    Theses methods are implemented in terms of the lower level methods, but
    provide an interface which is more abstract, and easier to re-implement
    on other non-POSIX systems. These should be used in preference to the
    lower ones.

    For efficiency, when getting or setting a large number of flags, it may
    be more efficient to call getattr, then operate on the returned object,
    before possibly passing it to setattr. The returned IO::Termios::Attrs
    object supports the same methods as documented here.

    The following two sections of code are therefore equivalent, though the
    latter is more efficient as it only calls setattr once.

     $term->setbaud( 38400 );
     $term->setcsize( 8 );
     $term->setparity( 'n' );
     $term->setstop( 1 );


     my $attrs = $term->getattr;
     $attrs->setbaud( 38400 );
     $attrs->setcsize( 8 );
     $attrs->setparity( 'n' );
     $attrs->setstop( 1 );
     $term->setattr( $attrs );

    However, a convenient shortcut method is provided for the common case
    of setting the baud rate, character size, parity and stop size all at
    the same time. This is set_mode:

     $term->set_mode( "38400,8,n,1" );

 getibaud

 getobaud

 setibaud

 setobaud

 setbaud

       $baud = $term->getibaud
    
       $baud = $term->getobaud
    
       $term->setibaud( $baud )
    
       $term->setobaud( $baud )
    
       $term->setbaud( $baud )

    Convenience accessors for the ispeed and ospeed. $baud is an integer
    directly giving the line rate, instead of one of the Bnnn constants.

 getcsize

 setcsize

       $bits = $term->getcsize
    
       $term->setcsize( $bits )

    Convenience accessor for the CSIZE bits of c_cflag. $bits is an integer
    5 to 8.

 getparity

 setparity

       $parity = $term->getparity
    
       $term->setparity( $parity )

    Convenience accessor for the PARENB and PARODD bits of c_cflag. $parity
    is n, o or e.

 getstop

 setstop

       $stop = $term->getstop
    
       $term->setstop( $stop )

    Convenience accessor for the CSTOPB bit of c_cflag. $stop is 1 or 2.

 getflag_cread

 setflag_cread

       $mode = $term->getflag_cread
    
       $term->setflag_cread( $mode )

    Accessor for the CREAD bit of the c_cflag. This enables the receiver.

 getflag_hupcl

 setflag_hupcl

       $mode = $term->getflag_hupcl
    
       $term->setflag_hupcl( $mode )

    Accessor for the HUPCL bit of the c_cflag. This lowers the modem
    control lines after the last process closes the device.

 getflag_clocal

 setflag_clocal

       $mode = $term->getflag_clocal
    
       $term->setflag_clocal( $mode )

    Accessor for the CLOCAL bit of the c_cflag. This controls whether local
    mode is enabled; which if set, ignores modem control lines.

 getflag_icanon

 setflag_icanon

       $mode = $term->getflag_icanon
    
       $term->setflag_icanon( $mode )

    Accessor for the ICANON bit of c_lflag. This is called "canonical" mode
    and controls whether the terminal's line-editing feature will be used
    to return a whole line (if true), or if individual bytes from
    keystrokes will be returned as they are available (if false).

 getflag_echo

 setflag_echo

       $mode = $term->getflag_echo
    
       $term->setflag_echo( $mode )

    Accessor for the ECHO bit of c_lflag. This controls whether input
    characters are echoed back to the terminal.

TODO

      * Adding more getflag_*/setflag_* convenience wrappers

      * Automatically upgrading STDIN/STDOUT/STDERR if appropriate, given a
      flag.

       use IO::Termios -upgrade;
      
       STDIN->setflag_echo( 0 );
