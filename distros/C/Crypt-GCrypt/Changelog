    - Makefile.PL now requires libgcrypt being not older than 1.3.0

version 1.23_03 (2009/12/07):

    - fixes to make 07-thread.t pass (or skip) regardless of thread support
      or libgcrypt version

version 1.23_01 (2009/11/24):

    - added new version check functions gcrypt_version() and 
      built_against_version() (Daniel Kahn Gillmor)
    - fixed a memory leak and other minor memory optimizations (Daniel Kahn Gillmor)
    - new cipher_algo_available() package function (Daniel Kahn Gillmor)
    - message digests (Daniel Kahn Gillmor)

version 1.22 (2009/11/01):

    - now thread-safe (patch by Daniel K. Gillmor)

version 1.21 (2009/02/04):

    - added Devel::CheckLib to avoid FAIL reports from CPAN testers

version 1.20 (2008/01/25):

    - new "none" padding method

    - added an optimization to make the new API a bit retrocompatible
      in some special cases
    
    - padding recognition is more robust

    - [API CHANGE] ->finish() is now required after decrypting, because
      the previous implementation contained a bug when decrypting data 
      in multiple calls to ->decrypt(): the module tried to strip
      padding at every call, thus removing wrong bytes in some cases.
      Added the 06-multi.t test and a warning for users who don't 
      call the ->finish() method.
      (thanks to Paul Kolano for bug report and test case)
