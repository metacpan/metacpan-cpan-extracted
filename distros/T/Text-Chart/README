NAME
    Text::Chart - Generate text-based chart

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.041 of Text::Chart (from Perl
    distribution Text-Chart), released on 2021-04-10.

SYNOPSIS
     use Text::Chart qw(gen_text_chart);

    Bar chart:

     my $res = gen_text_chart(
         data => [1, 5, 3, 9, 2],
         type => 'bar',
     );

    will produce this:

     *
     *****
     ***
     *********
     **

    Adding data labels and showing data values:

     my $res = gen_text_chart(
         data => [["Andi",1], ["Budi",5], ["Cinta",3], ["Dewi",9], ["Edi",2]],
         type => 'bar',
         show_data_label => 1,
         show_data_value => 1,
     );

    Result:

     Andi |*         (1)
     Budi |*****     (5)
     Cinta|***       (3)
     Dewi |********* (9)
     Edi  |**        (2)

    "Column chart:"

     my $res = gen_text_chart(
         data => [["Andi",1], ["Budi",5], ["Cinta",3], ["Dewi",9], ["Edi",2]],
         type => 'column',
         show_data_label => 1,
     );

    Result:

                         *
                         *
                         *
                         *
            *            *
            *            *
      *     *      *     *
      *     *      *     *     *
      *     *      *     *     *
     Andi  Budi  Cinta  Dewi  Edi

    "Sparkline chart:"

     my $res = gen_text_chart(
         data => [["Andi",1], ["Budi",5], ["Cinta",3], ["Dewi",9], ["Edi",2]],
         type => 'column',
         show_data_label => 1,
     );

     my $res = gen_text_chart(
         data => [1.5, 0.5, 3.5, 2.5, 5.5, 4.5, 7.5, 6.5],
         type => 'sparkline',
     );

    Result:

     XXX

    "Plotting multiple data columns:"

     XXX

DESCRIPTION
    THIS IS AN EARLY RELEASE, MANY FEATURES ARE NOT YET IMPLEMENTED.
    Currently only sparkline chart is implemented. Showing data labels and
    data values are not yet implemented.

    This module lets you generate text-based charts.

FUNCTIONS
  gen_text_chart
    Usage:

     gen_text_chart(%args) -> str

    Generate text-based chart.

    This function is not exported by default, but exportable.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   chart_height => *float*

    *   chart_width => *float*

    *   data* => *array[num]|array[array]|array[hash]*

        (Table) data to chart.

        Either in the form of array of numbers, example:

         [1366,1248,319,252]

        or an array of arrays (there must be at least one number columns),
        example:

         [["China",1366],["India",1248],["United Status",319], ["Indonesia",252]]

        or an array of hashes (there must be at least one key which
        consistently contain numbers), example:

         [{country=>"China"        , population=>1366},
          {country=>"India"        , population=>1248},
          {country=>"United Status", population=> 319},
          {country=>"Indonesia"    , population=> 252}]

        All data needs to be in table form (where there are notions of rows
        and columns/fields). Array data is assumed to be a single-column
        table with the column named "data". Array of arrays will have
        columns named "column0", "column1" and so on. Array of hashes will
        have columns named according to the hash keys.

    *   data_column => *str|array[str]*

        Which column(s) contain data to plot.

        Multiple data columns are supported.

    *   label_column => *str*

        Which column contains data labels.

        If not specified, the first non-numeric column will be selected.

    *   spec => *hash*

        Table specification, according to TableDef.

    *   type* => *str*

        Chart type.

    Return value: (str)

FAQ
  Why am I getting 'Wide character in print/say' warning?
    You are probably printing Unicode characters to STDOUT without doing
    something like this beforehand:

     binmode(STDOUT, ":utf8");

SEE ALSO
    Text::Graph, a mature CPAN module for doing text-based graphs. Before
    writing Text::Chart I used this module for a while, but ran into the
    problem of weird generated graphs. In addition, I don't like the way
    Text::Graph draws things, e.g. a data value of 1 is drawn as zero-width
    bar, or the label separator ":" is always drawn. So I decided to write
    an alternative charting module instead. Compared to Text::Graph, here
    are the things I want to add or do differently as well: functional
    (non-OO) interface, colors, Unicode, resampling, more chart types like
    sparkline, animation and some interactivity (perhaps).

    App::tchart, a CLI for Text::Chart.
