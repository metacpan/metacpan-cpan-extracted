       - Message::encode no longer tries fix potential 'double-encoding' (in any case it appeared to be doing it wrong).
         Now it just complains if you try to pass in undecoded strings. (thanks Daisuke Maki and KATOU Akira)

0.25   Sun, 21 Mar 2010 03:50:40 UTC
       - Gah, $VERSION lameness

0.24   Sun, 21 Mar 2010 03:39:40 UTC
       - Fix test breakage in 0.23

0.23   Thu, 18 Mar 2010 17:23:36 UTC
       - Removed UNIVERSAL::require dependency
       - Net::OAuth->request constructor now dies if module fails to load (thanks Mike Schleif)

       - Replaced die() with croak()

       - Renamed xAuthAccessTokenRequest to XauthAccessTokenRequest for CamelCaseConsistency
       - Added a couple tests for XauthAccessTokenRequest

       - Added xAuth support with xAuthAccessTokenRequest (thanks Masayoshi Sekimura and Simon Wistow)
       - Added performance patch to decrease stat() system calls when requiring modules (thanks Brad Whitaker)

0.20   Fri, 13 Nov 2009 18:56:55 UTC
       - Fixed RT#48867 - error in synopsis - thanks Adam Taylor!
       - Removed UTF8 double-encoding warning.  Now Net::OAuth::Message::encode() uses Encode::is_utf8() to determine if
         the input is already UTF-8 encoded.  If so, it runs decode_utf8() on it before sending it to uri_escape_utf8().
         Thanks Hector Garcia Alvarez!
       - Potentially fixed an issue found by Marc Mims, where HMAC_SHA1 was failing to load, breaking some CPAN tests.
         Build.PL now explicitly requires Digest::SHA1 and Encode.  Hopefully that fixes it.

       [Bug Fixes]
       - Fixed RT#47369 - Don't automatically set oauth_version parameter when message is created via from_hash (or

       - Fixed RT#47293 - Message->from_hash was validating using the incorrect class, causing a 'Parameter X not valid
         for a message of type Y' message on V1.0a messages.  Thanks Jeff Dairiki!
