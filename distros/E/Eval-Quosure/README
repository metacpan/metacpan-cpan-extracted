    Eval::Quosure - Evaluate within a caller environment

VERSION

    version 0.001000

SYNOPSIS

        use Eval::Quosure;
    
        sub foo {
            my $a = 2;
            my $b = 3;
            return Eval::Quosure->new('bar($a, $b, $c)');
        }
    
        sub bar {
            my ($a, $b, $c) = @_;
            return $a * $b * $c;
        }
    
        my $q = foo();
    
        my $a = 0;  # This is not used when evaluating the quosure.
        print $q->eval( { '$c' => 7 } ), "\n";

DESCRIPTION

    This class acts similar to R's "quosure". A "quosure" is an object that
    combines an expression and an environment in which the expression can
    be evaluated.

    Note that as this is string eval so is not secure. USE IT WITH CAUTION!

METHODS

 expr

    Get the expression stored in the object.

 captures

    Get the captured variables stored in the object. Returns a hashref with
    keys being variables names including sigil and values being references
    to the variables.

 caller

    Get the caller info stored in the object. Returns an arrayref of same
    structure as what the caller() returns.

 eval

        eval(HashRef $additional_captures={})

    Evaluate the quosure's expression in its own environment, with captured
    variables from what's obtained when the quosure's created plus
    specified by $additional_captures, which is a hashref with keys be the
    full name of the variable including sigil.

CONSTRUCTION

        new(Str $expr, $level=0)

    $expr is a string. $level is used like the argument of caller and
    PadWalker's peek_my, 0 is for the scope that creates the quosure
    object, 1 is for the upper scope of the scope that creates the quosure,
    and so on.

SEE ALSO

    R's "rlang" package <https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rlang>
    which provides quosure.
