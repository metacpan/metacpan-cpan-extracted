 [BUG FIXES]
 - CPAN testers feedback: back off Perl version requirement from 5.26 to
   5.20 (which is 3 years older than buildah)
 - CPAN testers feedback: remove buildah path check from t/011_prog.t
   because of course test machines don't have it
 - CPAN testers feedback: make t/014_buildah.t skip all tests if buildah
   isn't found
