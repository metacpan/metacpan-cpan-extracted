NAME
    Types::CLike - C-like data types for Moo(se)

SYNOPSIS
        package MyPackage;
        use Moo;  # or Moose or Mouse
        use Types::CLike qw(:c);
 
        has 'foo' => (
           isa => Int     # or Int32, Signed32
        );
        has 'bar' => (
           isa => Short   # or SmallInt, Int16, Signed16
        );
 
        use Scalar::Util qw(blessed);
        use Math::BigFloat;
        use Sub::Quote;
 
        has 'baz' => (
           isa => Double,  # or Float64, Binary64
 
           # A Double number gets pretty big, so make sure we use big numbers
           coerce => quote_sub q{
              Math::BigFloat->new($_[0])
                 unless (blessed $_[0] =~ /^Math::BigFloat|^bignum/);
           },
        );

DESCRIPTION
    Given the popularity of various byte-sized data types in C-based
    languages, databases, and computers in general, there's a need for
    validating those data types in Perl & Moo(se). This module covers the
    gamut of the various number and character types in all of those forms.

    The number types will validate that the number falls within the right
    bit length, that unsigned numbers do not go below zero, and "Perl
    unsafe" numbers are blessed. Blessed numbers are also checked to make
    sure they have an accuracy that supports the right number of significant
    decimal digits. (However, BigInt/Float defaults to 40 digits, which is
    above the 39 digits for 128-bit numbers, so you should be safe.)

    Char types will validate that it's a single character, using Perl's
    Unicode-complaint "length" function. The bit check types will also check
    that the ASCII/Unicode code ("ord") is the right bit length.

    IEEE 754 decimal floating types are also available, which are floats
    that use a base-10 mantissa. And the SQL Server "money" types, which are
    basically decimal numbers stored as integers.

TYPES
    All available types (including lots of aliases) are listed below:

        ### Integers ###
                  [SIGNED]                                   | [UNSIGNED]
          4-bit = SNibble SSemiOctet Int4 Signed4            | Nibble SemiOctet UInt4 Unsigned4
          8-bit = SByte SOctet TinyInt Int8 Signed8          | Byte Octet UnsignedTinyInt UInt8 Unsigned8
         16-bit = Short SmallInt Int16 Signed16              | UShort UnsignedSmallInt UInt16 Unsigned16
         24-bit = MediumInt Int24 Signed24                   | UnsignedMediumInt UInt24 Unsigned24
         32-bit = Int Int32 Signed32                         | UInt UnsignedInt UInt32 Unsigned32
         64-bit = Long LongLong BigInt Int64 Signed64        | ULong ULongLong UnsignedBigInt UInt64 Unsigned64
        128-bit = SOctaWord SDoubleQuadWord Int128 Signed128 | OctaWord DoubleQuadWord UInt128 Unsigned128
 
        ### Floats (binary) ###
        (Total, Exponent) bits; Significand precision = Total - Exponent - 1 (sign bit)
 
        ( 16,  4) bits = ShortFloat
        ( 16,  5) bits = Half Float16 Binary16
        ( 32,  8) bits = Single Real Float Float32 Binary32
        ( 40,  8) bits = ExtendedSingle Float40
        ( 64, 11) bits = Double Float64 Binary64
        ( 80, 15) bits = ExtendedDouble Float80
        (104,  8) bits = Decimal    # not a IEEE 754 decimal, but C#'s bizarre "128-bit" float
        (128, 15) bits = Quadruple Quad Float128 Binary128
 
        ### Floats (decimal) ###
        (Digits, Exponent Max)
 
        ( 7,   96) = Decimal32
        (16,  384) = Decimal64
        (34, 6144) = Decimal128
 
        ### "Money" ###
        (Bits, Scale)
 
        ( 32,  4) = SmallMoney
        ( 64,  4) = Money Currency
        (128,  6) = BigMoney  # doesn't exist; might change if it does suddenly exists
 
        ### Chars ###
        Bit check types = Char/Char8, Char16, Char32, Char48, Char64

EXPORTER TAGS
    Since there are so many different aliases in this module, using ":all"
    (while available) probably isn't a good idea. So, there are some
    Exporter tags available, grouped by language:

        # NOTE: Some extra types are included to fill in the gaps for signed vs. unsigned and
        # byte vs. char.
 
        :c       = Char Byte Short UShort Int UInt Long ULong Float Double ExtendedDouble
        :stdint  = Int4 UInt4 ... Int128 UInt128 (except 24-bit)
        :c#      = SByte Byte Char16 Short UShort Int UInt Long ULong Float Double Decimal
        :ieee754 = Binary16,32,64,128 and Decimal32,64,128
        :tsql    = TinyInt SmallInt Int BigInt SmallMoney Money Float64 Real
        :mysql   = TinyInt SmallInt MediumInt Int BigInt (and Unsigned versions) Float Double
        :ansisql = SmallInt Int Float Real Double
 
        :is_*     = All of the is_* functions for that tag
        :to_*     = Same for to_* functions
        :assert_* = Same for assert_* functions
        :+*       = Imports is_*, to_*, assert_*, and types for that tag

CAVEATS
  Types::Numbers
    All of these types are basically aliases of parameterized types in
    Types::Numbers. Caveats of those types apply here. The types used are as
    follows:

        SignedInt     # signed integers
        UnsignedInt   # unsigned integers
        FloatBinary   # binary floats
        FloatDecimal  # decimal floats
        FixedBinary   # money types
        Char          # char types

  Type namespace conflicts
    Some types are also used by Types::Standard and Types::Numbers, namely
    "Int" and "Char". So be careful not to import them at the same time, as
    they have different meanings.

  Differences between CLike and real data types
    Most C-based languages use a "char" type to indicate both an 8-bit
    number and a single character, as all strings in those languages are
    represented as a series of character codes. Perl, as a dynamic language,
    has a single scalar to represent both strings and numbers. Thus, to
    separate the validation of the two, the term "Byte" or "Octet" means the
    numeric 8-bit types, and the term "Char" means the single character
    string types.

    The term "long" in C/C++ is ambiguous depending on the bits of the OS:
    32-bits for 32-bit OSs and 64-bits for 64-bit OSs. Since the 64-bit
    version makes more sense (ie: "short < int < long"), that is the
    designation chosen. To avoid confusion, you can just use "LongLong" and
    "ULongLong".

    The confusion is even worse for float types, with the "long" modifier
    sometimes meaning absolutely nothing in certain hardware platforms.
    "Long" isn't even used in this module for those types, in favor of IEEE
    754's "Extended" keyword.

  Floats
    The floats will support infinity and NaN, since C floats support this.
    This may not be desirable, so you might want to subtype the float and
    test for Inf/NaN if you don't want these. Furthermore, the "Perl safe"
    scalar tests for floats include checks to make sure it supports Inf/NaN.
    However, the odds of it NOT supporting those (since Perl should be using
    IEEE 754 floats for NV) are practically zero.

    Hopefully, I've covered all possible types of floats found in the wild.
    If not, let me know and I'll add it in. (For that matter, let me know if
    I'm missing any type found in the wild.)

HISTORY
    This module started out as MooX::Types::CLike. Since Type::Tiny came
    about, that module has been translated to work with TT's API. Both
    Types::Numbers and this module are the result.
