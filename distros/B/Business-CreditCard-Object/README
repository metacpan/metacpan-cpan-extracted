NAME
    Business::CreditCard::Object - a Credit Card object

SYNOPSIS
            my $card = Business::CreditCard::Object->new("4929-4929-4929-4929");

            if ($card->is_valid) { 
                    print "Card " . $card->number . " is a " . $card->type;
            }

DESCRIPTION
    This provides an OO interface around the Business::CreditCard module.
    You instantiate it with a card number, and can ask if it is valid, for a
    standardised version of the card number, and what type of card it is.

METHODS
  new
            my $card = Business::CreditCard::Object->new("4929-4929-4929-4929");

    Construct a new Card object. The card number can contain optional
    numbers and/or spaces.

  is_valid
    This computes the checksum for the card given and returns a boolean
    value for whether or not the number passes this check.

  type
    This returns the type of card given. See Business::CreditCard for a list
    of possible values.

  number
    This returns a standardised version of the card number as a string of
    digits with all spaces and minus signs removed. The object will also
    stringify to this value.
