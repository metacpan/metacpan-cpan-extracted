NAME
    Dancer::Plugin::WindowSession - Manage Per-Browser-Window sessions.

VERSION
    version 0.02

SYNOPSIS
            use Dancer;
            use Dancer::Plugin::WindowSession;

            get '/' => sub {
                    ## Read Session-wide variable
                    ## (applies to all open browser windows)
                    my $username = session 'username';

                    ## Read Window-Session variable
                    ## (will be different for every open browser window)
                    my $color = window_session 'color';

                    ## [ return something to the user ]
            };

            ## Assume the user submitted a POST <form>
            ## with new data, save some variables to the standard session,
            ## and others to the per-window session.
            post 'change_settings' => sub {
                    my $username = param 'username';
                    my $color = param 'color';

                    session 'username' => $username ;
                    window_session 'color' => $color ;

                    ## [ return something to the user ]
            };

            dance;

            ######################
            In all the template files, you must pass-on the 'winsid' CGI variable,
            either as part of a URL or as part of a POST <form> varaible.

            Using Template::Toolkit templtates:

            <a href="some_other_page?winsid=[% winsid | uri %]">Go to some other page</a>

            OR

            <form method="post">
                    <input type="hidden" name="winsid" value="[% winsid|uri %]">
            </form>

FUNCTIONS
    `window_session' - Read/Write access to the per-window-session
    variables. Behaves exactly like Dancer's `session' keyword.

    `window_session_id' - Returns the per-window-session ID number (if you
    need to embed it in a URL string).

DESCRIPTION
    This module makes it easy to manage per-window session variables (as
    opposed to browser-wide session variables).

    The common use case is when you expect users of your website to have
    multiple web-browser windows open with your web-site, and for each open
    window you want to maintain independant set of variables.

IMPLEMENTATION
    To use this plugin effectively, be sure to include the `winsid' value in
    all URLs and POST forms you have in your templates.

    This plugin uses the same session engine configured for your Dancer
    application (see Dancer::Session).

CONFIGURATION
    No configuration options are available, at the moment.

    Future version might allow changing the name of the CGI varaible
    (`winsid') to something else.

BUGS
    Possibly many.

    NOTE: If a user copies a URL (containing the `winsid' value) and pastes
    it in a new browser window (or sends it to another user) - then both
    windows will share the same sessions. This can be viewed as a bug (The
    per-window mechanism does not really guarentee to be a single-window
    session) or a feature (users can easily share their session state with
    other users).
