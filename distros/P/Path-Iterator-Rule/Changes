Revision history for Path-Iterator-Rule

1.015     2021-09-09 12:07:00-04:00 America/New_York

    [FIXED]

    - Directories on windows that return true for `-r` but
      false for `opendir` now warn and skip instead of attempting
      `readdir`.

1.014     2018-06-27 09:46:20-04:00 America/New_York

    [DOCS]

    - Noted that file separators are unix-style forward slashes.

1.013     2018-06-20 16:48:23-06:00 America/Denver

    [CHANGED]

    - Breadth-first search now reads children lazily on demand,
      instead of pre-computing children and adding them to the queue.

1.012     2016-04-10 13:45:55-04:00 America/New_York

    [PREREQS]

    - Dropped minimum Perl version required to 5.008001

1.011     2016-02-29 22:17:45-05:00 America/New_York

    [ADDED]

    - Added 'report_symlinks' option to include symlinks in results, even
      if not descending into directories.  Defaults to 'follow_symlinks'
      if not explicitly set.

1.010     2016-02-29 21:48:56-05:00 America/New_York

    [FIXED]

    - Protects tests from temporary directory names that cause false
      errors.

1.009     2015-09-20 22:02:20-04:00 America/New_York

    [FIXED]

    - Regular expressions flags were being lost.  Now name(qr/foo/i) works
      like iname(qr/foo/)

    [ADDED]

    - Added VCS rules for DARCS (Gian Piero Carrubba)

1.001     2013-03-02 08:50:25 America/New_York

    [FIXED]

      the minimum Perl once again

1.000     2013-02-27 15:25:47 America/New_York

    [INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES]

    - Custom rule logic has changed.  The previous "0 but true" hack
      will throw an exception.  Custom rules should return \1 or \0
      to signal that a directory should be pruned but returned or
      pruned and skipped, respectively

    [ADDED]

    - Added 'skip_subdirs' method (Issue #7)

    [DOCUMENTED]

    - Clarified max/min depth rules

0.014     2013-02-16 09:57:39 America/New_York

    [CHANGED]

    - Refactored some internals to allow more flexible subclassing

      for less typing for one-liners

    [FIXED]

    - Really fixed tests on Windows this time, I hope.

0.010     2013-01-31 15:56:17 America/New_York

    [ADDED]

    - Added a "visitor" option to pass results to a code reference
      during iteration

    [CHANGED]

    - Calling all() in void context will iterate but not store results

    [FIXED]

    - Another attempt at fixing tests on Windows. Damn those backslashes!

0.009     2013-01-25 21:52:41 America/New_York

    [FIXED]

    - Fixed tests on Windows

0.008     2013-01-24 09:05:01 America/New_York

0.007     2013-01-23 22:35:47 America/New_York

    [DOCUMENTED]

    - Fixed typo relating to Number::Compare.  "1M" is legal, "1MB" is not

    [CHANGED]

    - Even more internal optimization

0.005     2013-01-23 19:55:57 America/New_York

0.004     2013-01-23 19:37:47 America/New_York

    [ADDED]

    - Added 'iter_fast' and 'all_fast' methods that switch default options
      from safe to fast

0.003     2013-01-23 18:32:31 America/New_York

    [DOCUMENTED]

    - Added PERFORMANCE section with tips

    - Additional internal optimization

0.002     2013-01-23 14:38:24 America/New_York

    [INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES]

    - Test subroutines now get path, basename and stash
      instead of just path and stash; this saves substantial
      overhead on name checks.

    - Add 'sorted' option that defaults to true; disabling
      this can improve speed for directories with many files

    [CHANGED]

    - Setting 'error_handler' to undef disables error
      checks for speed

    - Various other optimizations for improved performance
