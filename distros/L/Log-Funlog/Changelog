 0.84_1		25/04/2005
 * test.t was bugged

 0.84		14/04/2005
 * No more complaining when you ask verbose absurdly high ( > levelmax)
 + Colors in log, if you want, and if your are not under MSWin
 + Splitting funny sentences from Log::Funlog's core to Log::Funlog::Lang. Long
 time since I wanted to do such a thing! So I can clean the directory from all
 the stuff laying around.
 
 + If Log::Funlog::Lang is not present and you don't ask for fun, it won't
 complain (so that you can use Log::Funlog in a production environment: it
 has no more fancy things in it that a customer could see.)

 specify %ss

 is somewhat symetric)

 0.82		27/12/2004
 * Numbering change so that it conforms to perl usage, and you can say:
 	use Log::Funlog 0.82;
 + You can now say:
 	verbose => 'n/m',
 and n can be 'max'. What for? In case of n is an option of the command line,
 and you want the max debug level: you don't have to remember what is the max debug
 level, just say 'max' :)
