NAME

    Alien::Build::Plugin::Fetch::Prompt - Alien::Build plugin to prompt a
    user before making external download

VERSION

    version 0.58

SYNOPSIS

    In your ~/.alienbuild/rc.pl

     preload 'Fetch::Prompt';
     1;

DESCRIPTION

    This plugin allows you to force Alien::Build to prompt the user and ask
    for permission before downloading anything from the internet. It uses
    the ExtUtils::MakeMaker prompt function, so that it will do the
    sensible thing, like not infinitely halt install on non-interactive
    installs. The default response is yes, which is usually reasonable (and
    the default if you do not use this plugin at all), but you may change
    this by using the ALIEN_DOWNLOAD environment variable (see below).

ENVIRONMENT

 ALIEN_DOWNLOAD

    Set this environment variable to the default response. Should be either
    yes or no.

CAVEATS

    This plugin depends on the alienfile using the appropriate channels for
    downloading external libraries. It is perfectly legal to write a
    alienfile that downloads using an external program like wget or curl,
    or not go through the normal fetch plugin. There is also nothing
    stopping someone from doing something nefarious when installing a cpan
    module. If you have strict security requirements you really should
    audit the alienfile and other Perl code that you are using.
