NAME
    Apache::TinyCP - a tiny content provider to put up content really
    quickly

SYNOPSIS
    In your Apache configuration:

        PerlModule Apache::TinyCP
    
        <Location />
            SetHandler  perl-script
            PerlHandler Apache::TinyCP

            DirectoryIndex HomePage

            PerlSetVar  ContentDir       /home/www/content
            PerlSetVar  TemplateDir      /home/www/templates
            PerlSetVar  CacheDir         /home/www/var/contentcache
            PerlSetVar  ModTimeFormat    %d.%b.%y
        </Location>

    In your "ContentDir" directory, a file named HomePage, along with other
    content files:

        Hello, world! *This* is the HomePage!
    
        Here's a link to AnotherPage.
    
        See [=Text::KwikiFormatish] for more info on the default formatter

    In your "TemplateDir" directory, a file named layout:

        <html>
            <head>
                <title>My Site - [% title %]</title>
            </head>
            <body>
                <h1>[% title %]</h1>
                <hr/>
                [% content %]
                <hr/>
                <p>Last modified: [% modtime %]</p>
            </body>
        </html>

DESCRIPTION
    This module is a very simple handler that takes files from ContentDir,
    formats them somehow, and stamps on a header and footer using the
    template file template in TemplateDir. The default formatter is
    Text::KwikiFormatish and the end result is somewhat of a pseudo-wiki web
    site. It was created because I enjoyed the ease and functionality of
    Kwiki text for creating content, but wanted something like a single-user
    wiki.

    To set this up, create the three directories and set them as
    "TemplateDir", "ContentDir" and "CacheDir" in the Apache configuration,
    like in "SYNOPSIS".

    By default the content files located in ContentDir are formatted with
    Text::KwikiFormatish and cached with Cache::File, which uses the path
    specified at CacheDir to store cache files. The default templating
    system is Template::Toolkit. The handler uses the layout template
    wrapper in "TemplateDir". The tags "[% content %]", "[% title %]" and
    "[% modified %]" are replaced by the formatted content, the filename,
    and the formatted modification date (respectively).

    You could probably do this by writing a formatting handler and filtering
    that through Apache::Template, though I'm not sure how the caching would
    work. You might also want to check out Apache::Sandwich. If any of these
    ways works for you, more power to ya.

    My goal was to have all my content files in one place (not htdocs) as
    well as use wiki text for the rapid creation of content for my site.

EXTENDING
  Changing the Formatter
    Say you wanted to write your pages in POD instead of Kwikish text. You
    would create a custom package, override the "format_content()" method
    and use that as your PerlHandler. In your Apache configuration:

        <Perl>
            use Pod::Simple::HTML ();
        
            package Local::TinyCP;
            use base qw( Apache::TinyCP );
        
            sub format_content {
                my ( $self, $data, $r ) = @_;
                my $output;
            
                my $parser = Pod::Simple::HTML->new;
                $parser->output_string( \$output );
                $parser->parse_string_document( $data );
            
                return $output;
            }
        </Perl>
    
        <Location />
            ...
            PerlHandler Local::TinyCP
            ...
        </Location>

  Futher Customization
    Here are all of the methods you can override. All methods are passed
    $self, the name of the package, as the first argument and sometimes $r,
    the Apache request object.

    * get_filename( $self, $r )
        Returns the absolute path to the content file.

    * get_content( $self, $filename, $r )
        Returns the formatted content to be inserted into the "[% content
        %]" template variable. By default, this formats with
        Text::KwikiFormatish and caches the formatted content using
        Cache::File.

    * format_content( $self, $data, $r )
        Return the formatted version of $data, the contents of the content
        file.

        This method is only used by "get_content". If you override
        "get_content", you will not need to override this method.

    * print_content( $self, $content, $r )
        Print the given $content to STDOUT. By default this method wraps the
        content in a template, and provides two extra variables: "[% title
        %]", the name of the document without a leading slash, and "[%
        modtime %]", the modification time of the document. The modification
        time format is configurable -- see "SYNOPSIS".

    * get_content_type( $self )
        Return the content type returned. Default is "text/html".

        This method is only used by "print_content". If you override
        "print_content", you will not need to override this method.

    * handler( $self, $r )
        mod_per1 handler method. You do not need to override this method
        unless you want to change the core logic.
