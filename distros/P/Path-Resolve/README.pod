=for html
<a href="https://travis-ci.org/mamod/Path-Resolve"><img src="https://travis-ci.org/mamod/Path-Resolve.svg?branch=master"></a>

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Path::Resolve;
    
    my $path = Path::Resolve->new();
    
    my $file = $path->resolve('./r/p/../file.txt');
    my $ext  = $path->extname($file);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module behaves exactly like L<node.js path module|https://nodejs.org/api/path.html>, it doesn't check for path validity, 
it only works on strings and has utilities to resolve and normalize path strings.

If you're looking for system specific path module that can create, check, chmod, copy ... etc. then
take a look at L<Path::Tiny>

=head1 METHODS

For a complete documentations about supported methods please check node.js path module
L<api documentation|https://nodejs.org/api/path.html> all methods are supported
