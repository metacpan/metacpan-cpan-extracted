=head1 NAME

inplace - Replace file with output of command

=head1 VERSION

This document describes version 0.001 of inplace (from Perl distribution Browser-Find-Windows), released on 2022-04-21.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 % inplace [INPLACE_OPTS] <COMMAND> <FILE> [CMD_OPTS]...

Example:

 % inplace csv2ansitable myfile.txt

If command is successful, then F<myfile.txt> will contain the output of the
command. F<myfile.txt~> will contain the original content. The file to be
replaced must be specified as the first argument to the command.

If you do not want any backup:

 % inplace -b csv2ansitable myfile.txt

If you want another backup extension other than the default C<~>:

 % inplace -b.bak csv2ansitable myfile.txt

If the file is not the first argument of the command, you can use C<-->:

 % inplace csv2ansitable -t -- myfile.txt

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<inplace> is a command wrapper to give "in-place editing" capability to another
command. Sometimes a command that manipulates file does not allow you to
overwrite an input file or even specify an output path; they output to stdout.
With B<inplace>, you can replace the content of the input file with the output
of the command in one go.

=head1 HOMEPAGE

Please visit the project's homepage at L<https://metacpan.org/release/Browser-Find-Windows>.

=head1 SOURCE

Source repository is at L<https://github.com/perlancar/perl-Browser-Find-Windows>.

=head1 SEE ALSO

B<sponge>, but with this command you need to specify the filename twice (but
useful when your command is a pipeline), e.g.:

 % sed '...' FILE | grep '...' | sponge FILE

=head1 CONTRIBUTING


To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull requests on
GitHub.

Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You can
simply modify the code, then test via:

 % prove -l

If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally on your
system), you can install L<Dist::Zilla>,
L<Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR>, and sometimes one or two other
Dist::Zilla plugin and/or Pod::Weaver::Plugin. Any additional steps required
beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.

Please report any bugs or feature requests on the bugtracker website L<https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Dist/Display.html?Name=Browser-Find-Windows>

When submitting a bug or request, please include a test-file or a
patch to an existing test-file that illustrates the bug or desired
feature.
