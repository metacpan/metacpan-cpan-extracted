NAME

    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::InsertExample - Insert example into your POD from
    a file

VERSION

    version 0.10

SYNOPSIS

    In your dist.ini:

     [InsertExample]

    In your POD:

     =head1 EXAMPLE
     
     Here is an exaple that writes hello world to the terminal:
     
     # EXAMPLE: example/hello.pl

    File in your dist named example/hello.pl

     #!/usr/bin/perl
     say 'hello world';

    After dzil build your POD becomes:

     =head1 EXAMPLE
     
     Here is an example that writes hello world to the terminal:
     
      #!/usr/bin/perl
      say 'hello world';

    and example/hello.pl is there too (unless you prune it with another
    plugin).

DESCRIPTION

    This plugin takes examples included in your distribution and inserts
    them in your POD where you have an EXAMPLE directive. This allows you
    to keep a version in the distribution which can be run by you and your
    users, as well as making it available in your POD documentation,
    without the need for updating example scripts in multiple places.

    When the example is inserted into your pod a space will be appended at
    the start of each line so that it is printed in a fixed width font.

    This plugin will first look for examples in the currently building
    distribution, including generated and munged files. If no matching
    filename is found, it will look in the distribution source root.

OPTIONS

 remove_boiler

    Remove the #!/usr/bin/perl, use strict; or use warnings; from the
    beginning of your example before inserting them into the POD.

 indent

    Specifies the number of spaces to indent by. This is 1 by default,
    because it is sufficient to force POD to consider it a verbatim
    paragraph. I understand a lot of Perl programmers out there prefer 4
    spaces. You can also set this to 0 to get no indentation at all and it
    won't be a verbatim paragraph at all.
