=head1 VERSION

version 0.102

=head1 SYNOPSIS

=head1 DESCRIPTION

=head2 inlineSQL

Returns the "inline SQL" representation for this condition. See L<EntityModel::Query> description for more details on what this means.

=head2 parseCondition

An array reference expands out as follows:

 [ x => 3 ]

=head2 parseBranch

For a hashref, the following three items should be in the hash:

=over 4

=item * left - left node of the branch, this will be recursed into as appropriate

=item * right - right node of the branch, will be recursed as required

=item * op - the operation to perform, such as =, and, or, etc.

=back

An arrayref will use the '=' operation for all entries unless the second element is
a hashref, in which case the key will be used as the operation and the value as the
RHS.

=head2 parseQuery

=head2 quoteIdentifier

Convert an identifier to the quoted version.
