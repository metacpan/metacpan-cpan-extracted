This software requires Perl/Tk, and obviously, mtx.  

- mtx

  Tested with mtx versions 1.2.9, 1.2.10, 1.2.15 and 1.2.17, 1.2.18rel.

- Perl

  Perl is likely already installed on your system.  If not, you can
  fetch it from:

	http://www.cpan.org/src/stable.tar.gz

  Briefly, installation goes like this:

	tar -zxvpf stable.tar.gz
	cd perl-5.8.2
	sh Configure -des -Dprefix=/usr/local
	make
	make test
	make install

- Perl/Tk (using the perl executable from above in /usr/local/bin)

  Get it from:

	http://search.cpan.org/~ni-s/Tk-804.027/

  Briefly, installation goes like this:

	tar -zxvpf Tk804.027.tar.gz
	cd Tk804.027
	/usr/local/bin/perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install

- Proc::ProcessTable, Tk::ExecuteCommand and Tk::CollapsableFrame modules

  Fetch from CPAN and install in the standard manner:

	/usr/local/bin/perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install

*****
***** INSTALLATION OF TKJUKE FOLLOWS THE PERL IDIOM. AFTER UNPACKING:
*****

perl Makefile.PL
make 
make test
make install

At this point, edit tkjuke.config and make entries for your jukeboxes
using the example entries as a guide - tkjuke will auto-connect to the
listed machines.  If you have not setup either host-based or key
authentication the you'll need to enter the root passwords in the
window from which tkjuke was started.

  The program "wait-tape-ready" defines a system command that ensures media is
  ready after it has been loaded into a DTE. The basic idea is to
  status the drive until it is ready.

  IFF you experience tape-not-ready errors, or long delays after a
  "juke load" or "juke next" command, you must inspect this code
  and make appropriate changes. The code comments in "wait-tape-ready"
  tell you what to do. Please, send any changes to sol0@lehigh.edu.

  OK, juke/tkjuke installation and configuration is complete.  Have the
  appropriate amount of fun.
