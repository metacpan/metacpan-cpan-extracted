NAME
    PkgConfig::LibPkgConf - Interface to .pc file interface via libpkgconf

SYNOPSIS
     use PkgConfig::LibPkgConf;
 
     if(pkgconf_exists('libarchive'))
     {
       my $version = pkgconf_version('libarchive');
       my $cflags  = pkgconf_cflags('libarchive');
       my $libs    = pkgconf_libs('libarchive');
     }

DESCRIPTION
    Many libraries in compiled languages such as C or C++ provide ".pc"
    files to specify the flags required for compiling and linking against
    those libraries. Traditionally, the command line program "pkg-config" is
    used to query these files. This module provides a Perl level API using
    "libpkgconf" to these files.

    This module provides a simplified interface for getting the existence,
    version, cflags and library flags needed for compiling against a
    package, using the default compiled in configuration of "pkgconf". For a
    more powerful, but complicated interface see
    PkgConfig::LibPkgConf::Client. In addition, PkgConfig::LibPkgConf::Util
    provides some useful utility functions that are also provided by
    "pkgconf".

FUNCTIONS
  pkgconf_exists
     my $bool = pkgconf_exists $package_name;

    Returns true if the package is available.

    Exported by default.

  pkgconf_version
     my $version = pkgconf_version $package_name;

    Returns the version of the package, if it exists. Will throw an
    exception if not found.

    Exported by default.

  pkgconf_cflags
     my $cflags = pkgconf_cflags $package_name;

    Returns the compiler flags for the package, if it exists. Will throw an
    exception if not found.

    Exported by default.

  pkgconf_cflags_static
     my $cflags = pkgconf_cflags_static $package_name;

    Returns the static compiler flags for the package, if it exists. Will
    throw an exception if not found.

  pkgconf_libs
     my $libs = pkgconf_libs $package_name;

    Returns the linker library flags for the package, if it exists. Will
    throw an exception if not found.

    Exported by default.

  pkgconf_libs_static
     my $libs = pkgconf_libs_static $package_name;

    Returns the static linker library flags for the package, if it exists.
    Will throw an exception if not found.

SEE ALSO
    The best entry point to the low level "pkgconf" interface can be found
    via PkgConfig::LibPkgConf::Client.

    Alternatives include:

    PkgConfig
        Pure Perl implementation of "pkg-config" which can be used from the
        command line, or as an API from Perl. Does not require pkg-config in
        your path, so is a safe dependency for CPAN modules.

    ExtUtils::PkgConfig
        Wrapper for the "pkg-config" command line interface. This module
        will fail to install if "pkg-config" cannot be found in the "PATH",
        so it is not safe to use a dependency if you want your CPAN module
        to work on platforms where "pkg-config" is not installed.

    Alien::Base
        Provides tools for building non-Perl libraries and making them
        dependencies for your CPAN modules, even on platforms where the
        non-Perl libraries aren't already installed. Includes hooks for
        probing "pkg-config" ".pc" files using either "pkg-config" or
        PkgConfig.
