NAME

    spread-revolutionary-date - Spread date and time from Revolutionary
    (Republican) Calendar

VERSION

    version 0.10

DESCRIPTION

    spread-revolutionary-date is a Free Software
    <https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html> that spreads the current
    date, expressed in French Revolutionary calendar
    <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Republican_calendar>, to various
    social networks: Twitter <https://twitter.com/>, Mastodon
    <https://mastodon.social/>, and the Freenode <https://freenode.net/>
    Internet Relay Chat network.

    Moreover, you can easily extend these defaults targets with any desired
    one, see "EXTENDING TO NEW TARGETS", and even spread something else
    than the revolutionary date, see "msgmaker" option and "EXTENDING TO
    NEW MESSAGE MAKERS".

    The French Revolutionary calendar, also called Republican calendar, was
    introduced during the French Revolution
    <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Revolution>, and used from late
    1793 to 1805, and also during the Paris Commune
    <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Commune> in 1871. This was an
    attempt to get rid of religious and royalist references found in
    Gregorian calendar when naming measures of Time. Months were given new
    names based on nature, each day of the year, instead of being named
    after an associated saint, had a unique name associated with the rural
    economy: agricultural tools, common animals, grains, pastures, trees,
    roots, flowers, fruits, plants, and minerals. But this was also an
    attempt to give more rational in measuring Time, basing measures on
    decimal system. Instead of weeks, each month was divided into exactly 3
    décades, that is ten days; days were divided into ten hours; hours into
    100 minutes; and minutes into 100 seconds.

    You must have a registered account on each of the targets you want to
    spread the revolutionary date. And you must get credentials for
    spread-revolutionary-date to post on Twitter and Mastodon. Finally, you
    have to configure spread-revolutionary-date to use these credentials,
    see "CONFIGURATION" and "COMMAND LINE PARAMETERS" below.

    The revolutionary date and time is computed thanks to the
    DateTime::Calendar::FrenchRevolutionary Perl module, by Jean Forget.

USAGE

      # Just execute the script in your shell
      # to spread current date to configured accounts on Twitter, Mastodon and Freenode:
      $ spread-revolutionary-date
    
      # Or, since this script do nothing but calling the L<App::SpreadRevolutionaryDate> Perl module,
      # use this one-liner:
      $ perl -MApp::SpreadRevolutionaryDate -e 'App::SpreadRevolutionaryDate->new->spread;'
    
      # Test spreading to Mastodon only:
      $ spread-revolutionary-date --targets=mastodon --test
    
      # Test spreading to Twitter only in English:
      $ spread-revolutionary-date --targets=twitter --test --locale=en
    
      # Spread acab time to Twitter and Freenode explicit channels
      $ spread-revolutionary-date --targets=twitter \
          --targets=freenode \
          --freenode_channels='#revolution' \
          --freenode_channels='#acab' \
          --revolutionarydate_acab
    
      # Prompt user for a message to spread to mastodon
      $ spread-revolutionary-date --targets=mastodon \
          --msgwriter=UserPrompt

CONFIGURATION

    Once again: you have to configure spread-revolutionary-date with
    credentials for registered account on each of the desired targets, so
    it can spread the revolutionary date on behalf of these accounts.

    Configuration options may also be specified as command line parameters,
    see "COMMAND LINE PARAMETERS" below, which take precedence on options
    of the configuration file.

    The configuration file should lie on
    ~/.config/spread-revolutionary-date/spread-revolutionary-date.conf or
    ~/.spread-revolutionary-date.conf. In case a file is found on both
    paths, the second one is ignored. The configuration file should use the
    popular INI file format <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INI_file>. A
    sample configuration file can be found in this distribution at
    etc/sample-spread-revolutionary-date.conf.

 General options

    These options should appear outside of any section of the configuration
    file.

  targets

    This option can be specified multiple times, with values as strings. It
    explicitly defines targets where the revolutionary date should be
    spread to. Any value set for this option should be a valid target: any
    of the three default targets (twitter, mastodon, or freenode) or some
    new target if you have extended this application (see "EXTENDING TO NEW
    TARGETS"). If this option is not defined, the revolutionary date is
    spread on all three default targets: twitter, mastodon, and freenode.

  msgmaker

    This option can only be specified once, with a value as string. Spread
    a message computed by the class defined by the value of this option,
    defaults to RevolutionaryDate. The Value (case sensitive) of this
    option should correspond to an existing
    App::SpreadRevolutionaryDate::MsgMaker::Value class consuming
    App::SpreadRevolutionaryDate::MsgMaker role. Message makers values
    pre-defined in this distribution are RevolutionaryDate, which spreads
    the revolutionary date, and PromptUser, which prompts the user for the
    message to be spread (with confirmation). See "EXTENDING TO NEW MESSAGE
    MAKERS" for details on using a new value for this option.

  locale

    This option can only be specified once, with a value as string. Spread
    with chosen language. As of DateTime::Calendar::FrenchRevolutionary
    0.14, locale is limited to 'en' or 'fr', defaults to 'fr'.

  test

    This boolean option takes no value, either it is defined or not. If
    defined, do not actually spread the revolutionary date, just print it
    on standard output for Twitter and Mastodon, and send it on configured
    test channels for Freenode (see "test_channels" below).

  acab DEPRECATED

    This option is deprecated since version 0.09 of this distribution and
    may be removed in future release. Please use "acab" option in
    [revolutionarydate] section, as described below.

  twitter DEPRECATED

    This option is deprecated since version 0.07 of this distribution and
    may be removed in future release. Please use "targets" option, as
    described below. Spread on Twitter explicitly. If none of the twitter,
    mastodon, freenode option is set, the revolutionary date is spread on
    all of these three targets.

  mastodon DEPRECATED

    This option is deprecated since version 0.07 of this distribution and
    may be removed in future release. Please use "targets" option, as
    described below. Spread on Mastodon explicitly. If none of the twitter,
    mastodon, freenode option is set, the revolutionary date is spread on
    all of these three targets.

  freenode DEPRECATED

    This option is deprecated since version 0.07 of this distribution and
    may be removed in future release. Please use "targets" option, as
    described below. Spread on Freenode explicitly. If none of the twitter,
    mastodon, freenode option is set, the revolutionary date is spread on
    all of these three targets.

 Twitter options

    These options are credentials for spread-revolutionary-date to spread
    on a Twitter account. You have to get them from your Twitter API
    account <https://apps.twitter.com/> with write access level. They
    should be defined in the [twitter] section of the configuration file.

  consumer_key

    This option can only be specified once, with a value as string: your
    Twitter Consumer API key for this application.

  consumer_secret

    This option can only be specified once, with a value as string: your
    Twitter Consumer API secret key for this application.

  access_token

    This option can only be specified once, with a value as string: your
    Twitter Access token for this application.

  access_token_secret

    This option can only be specified once, with a value as string: your
    Twitter Access token secret for this application.

 Mastodon options

    These options are credentials for spread-revolutionary-date to spread
    on a Mastodon account. You have to get them from your Mastodon instance
    API account <https://mstdn.fr/settings/applications> with write scope.
    Note that Mastodon is a decentralized network with multiple instances,
    the previous link is for mstdn.fr instance, please replace url with
    your preferred instance. They should be defined in the [mastodon]
    section of the configuration file.

  instance

    This option can only be specified once, with a value as string: the
    domain name of your instance, eg: mastodon.social, mstdn.fr, etc.

  client_id

    This option can only be specified once, with a value as string: your
    Mastodon Client key for this application.

  client_secret

    This option can only be specified once, with a value as string: your
    Mastodon Client secret for this application.

  access_token

    This option can only be specified once, with a value as string: your
    Mastodon Access token for this application.

 Freenode options

    The first two options are credentials for spread-revolutionary-date to
    spread on a Freenode account. See
    https://freenode.net/kb/answer/registration to find out how to register
    an account on Freenode. They should be defined in the [twitter] section
    of the configuration file.

  nickname

    This option can only be specified once, with a value as string: your
    Freenode nickname.

  password

    This option can only be specified once, with a value as string: your
    Freenode password.

  channels

    This option can be specified multiple times, with values as strings.
    spread-revolutionary-date will spread on every channel specified with
    this option. This option should be specified at least one time if
    "test" option is not set. It is ignored if "test" option is set.

  test_channels

    This option can be specified multiple times, with values as strings.
    spread-revolutionary-date will spread on every channel specified with
    this option. This option should be specified at least one time if
    "test" option is set. It is ignored if "test" option is not set.

 RevolutionaryDate options

    These options change the way revolutionary date is computed when
    "msgmaker" option is RevolutionaryDate. They should be defined in the
    [revolutionarydate] section of the configuration file.

  acab

    This boolean option takes no value, either it is defined or not,
    defaults to false. If defined, instead of spreading the current date
    and time, pretend that decimal time is 1:31:20 (which corresponds to
    03:08:56 UTC, 04:08:56 Paris winter time, or 05:08:56 Paris summer
    time, in sexagesimal scale used by common Anglo-Babylonian Time).

  wikipedia_link

    This boolean option takes no value, either it is defined or not,
    defaults to true. If defined, a link to the wikipedia page, in language
    defined by the locale option, corresponding to the feast of the day, is
    added to the date to be spread.

 PromptUser option

  default

    This option can only be specified once, with a value as string. Instead
    of spreading the revolutionary date, prompt user (with confirmation)
    for the message to be spread, with a default value (if user enters
    nothing when prompted). If default option is not defined, the default
    message is 'Goodbye old world, hello revolutionary worlds' if the user
    enters nothing when prompted. The default option should be defined in
    the [promptuser] section of the configuration file. It is only used if
    "msgmaker" option is PromptUser.

EXTENDING TO NEW TARGETS

    Version 0.07 of this distribution is a complete redesign of the API,
    taking advantage of Moose, the postmodern object system for Perl 5,
    allowing to easily extend spread-revolutionary-date to other targets
    than the default ones (Twitter, Mastondon and Freenode.

    To add a new target, you should write a new class in the
    App::SpreadRevolutionaryDate::Target:: namespace (that is: the class
    should be App::SpreadRevolutionaryDate::Target::Mytarget for a new
    Mytarget target), that consumes the
    App::SpreadRevolutionaryDate::Target role. See "DESCRIPTION" in
    App::SpreadRevolutionaryDate::Target for a comprehensive description of
    this role.

    The name of the target should be added as a value of the "targets"
    option in lower case.

    Such a target class is actually just a wrapper. Usually a target has to
    use an existing specific module (which can be a Moose class or not) to
    perform the actual work of posting a message according the specific
    target protocol, after having complied with any potential required
    authentication. Such authentication should be carried on by the
    constructor or, along with posting, by the required spread method of
    the target class.

    To perform authentication and to post a message, there is a strong
    likelihood that the new target requires specific parameters (for eg.
    tokens, keys, account name, password, channels, etc.). These parameters
    should be defined as required attributes of the target class. Values
    for such attributes should be set in the configuration file, inside a
    section named after the target in lower case ([mytarget]), or as
    command line parameters prefixed with the name of the target in lower
    case, followed by an underscore (--mytarget_myparam).

    Should you extend spread-revolutionary-date to a new target, we advise
    you to have a look on how default targets are implemented:
    App::SpreadRevolutionaryDate::Target::Twitter with
    Net::Twitter::Lite::WithAPIv1_1 worker,
    App::SpreadRevolutionaryDate::Target::Mastodon with Mastodon::Client
    worker. Both are using OAuth2 protocol <https://oauth.net/2/> to
    perform authentication. The third default target,
    App::SpreadRevolutionaryDate::Target::Freenode, uses a chatbot
    <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot>:
    App::SpreadRevolutionaryDate::Target::Freenode::Bot subclassing
    Bot::BasicBot. You can also see a very simple example with a test file
    provided in this distribution at t/new_target.t, which just prints out
    the revolutionary date on the standard output using core module
    IO::Handle.

EXTENDING TO NEW MESSAGE MAKERS

    It is even easier to spread whatever you want instead of the
    revolutionary date. You should write a new class in the
    App::SpreadRevolutionaryDate::MsgMaker:: namespace (that is: the class
    should be App::SpreadRevolutionaryDate::MsgMaker::MyMsgMaker for a new
    MyMsgMaker message maker), that consumes the
    App::SpreadRevolutionaryDate::MsgMaker role. See "DESCRIPTION" in
    App::SpreadRevolutionaryDate::MsgMaker for a comprehensive description
    of this role.

    The name of the message maker should be set as a value of the
    "msgmaker" option in lower case.

    Such a message maker class is actually just a wrapper. Usually a
    message maker has to use an existing specific module (which can be a
    Moose class or not) to craft the message.
    App::SpreadRevolutionaryDate::Target::MsgMaker::RevolutionaryDate uses
    DateTime::Calendar::FrenchRevolutionary, while
    App::SpreadRevolutionaryDate::Target::MsgMaker::PromptUser is based on
    IO::Prompt::Hooked. You may need for example LWP to extract the message
    from a fetched web page or service, or XML::Feed to build it from a RSS
    <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS> feed, or DBI to retrieve it from a
    database, or nothing at all to spread a fixed message, etc.

    If your new message maker class needs specific parameters (other than
    locale, which comes with App::SpreadRevolutionaryDate::MsgMaker role),
    they should be defined as attributes of this class. Values for such
    attributes should be set in the configuration file, inside a section
    named after the message maker in lower case ([mymsgmaker]), or as
    command line parameters prefixed with the name of the message maker in
    lower case, followed by an underscore (--mytarget_myparam).

    Have a look to the
    App::SpreadRevolutionaryDate::Target::MsgMaker::PromptUser class, it
    shows a simple example on how to extend spread-revolutionary-date to a
    new message maker.
