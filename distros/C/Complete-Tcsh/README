NAME
    Complete::Tcsh - Completion module for tcsh shell

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.030 of Complete::Tcsh (from Perl
    distribution Complete-Tcsh), released on 2019-12-20.

DESCRIPTION
    tcsh allows completion to come from various sources. One of the simplest
    is from a list of words:

     % complete CMDNAME 'p/*/(one two three)/'

    Another source is from an external command:

     % complete CMDNAME 'p/*/`mycompleter --somearg`/'

    The command receives one environment variables "COMMAND_LINE" (string,
    raw command-line). Unlike bash, tcsh does not (yet) provide something
    akin to "COMP_POINT" in bash. Command is expected to print completion
    entries, one line at a time.

     % cat foo-complete
     #!/usr/bin/perl
     use Complete::Tcsh qw(parse_cmdline format_completion);
     use Complete::Util qw(complete_array_elem);
     my ($words, $cword) = @{ parse_cmdline() };
     my $res = complete_array_elem(array=>[qw/--help --verbose --version/], word=>$words->[$cword]);
     print format_completion($res);

     % complete foo 'p/*/`foo-complete`/'
     % foo --v<Tab>
     --verbose --version

    This module provides routines for you to be doing the above.

    Also, unlike bash, currently tcsh does not allow delegating completion
    to a shell function.

FUNCTIONS
  format_completion
    Usage:

     format_completion($completion) -> str|array

    Format completion for output (for shell).

    tcsh accepts completion reply in the form of one entry per line to
    STDOUT. Currently the formatting is done using "Complete::Bash"'s
    "format_completion" because escaping rule and so on are not yet well
    defined in tcsh.

    This function is not exported by default, but exportable.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   $completion* => *hash|array*

        Completion answer structure.

        Either an array or hash, as described in "Complete".

    Return value: Formatted string (or array, if `as` is set to `array`)
    (str|array)

  parse_cmdline
    Usage:

     parse_cmdline($cmdline) -> array

    Parse shell command-line for processing by completion routines.

    This function converts COMMAND_LINE (str) given by tcsh to become
    something like COMP_WORDS (array) and COMP_CWORD (int), like what bash
    supplies to shell functions. Currently implemented using
    "Complete::Bash"'s "parse_cmdline".

    This function is not exported by default, but exportable.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   $cmdline => *str*

        Command-line, defaults to COMMAND_LINE environment.

    Return value: (array)

    Return a 2-element array: "[$words, $cword]". $words is array of str,
    equivalent to "COMP_WORDS" provided by bash to shell functions. $cword
    is an integer, equivalent to "COMP_CWORD" provided by bash to shell
    functions. The word to be completed is at "$words->[$cword]".

    Note that COMP_LINE includes the command name. If you want the
    command-line arguments only (like in @ARGV), you need to strip the first
    element from $words and reduce $cword by 1.
