The following is a high-level summary based on those posted to the list:

2003-09-08
    +	spike implementation of the URL search
    +	a whole load of stress-testing & profiling; should handle expected
	load of 25 concurrent users, not pushed any higher at the moment.

    +	introduced checkboxes to make selecting search criteria more obvious.
    +	the Pager now works
    +	wrote a bare-bones off-line admin interface that can create users,
	list collections, and upload terms.  Pangloss shell can be found in
	'bin/pg_admin'.
    +	included a sample set of terms from Dan McQuillan into the test suite.
    +	lots of little bugfixes.
    +	started doing load tests.

2003-08-01
    +	fairly painless integration w/Apache, Pangloss now loads under

    +	updated filters make for more intuitive search navigation.

    +	basic search functionality now working.

2003-06-21
    +	creator & date required for all objects.

	translations, and proofreaders can modify statuses)

2003-06-14
    +	search page now dynamic, though search functionality still not
	implemented.
