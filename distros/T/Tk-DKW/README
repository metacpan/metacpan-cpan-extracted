I submit these widgets to the Perl community in the hope that someone
other than myself will find them useful. I have placed POD documentation
within as many as I could, time permitting, and those that do not have
adequate documentation will do eventually. The example programs should
show adequate usage profiles, though.

Requirements :-

    Tk::TiedListbox - by Andrew Allen <ada@fc.hp.com>
    Tk::Pane - by Graham Barr <gbarr@pobox.com>

The suite is built/installed in the conventional manner :-

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

The public classes are :-


	Tk::CheckBox -   A radio button style widget that uses a
                    check mark in a box. Useful as a boolean field.

	Tk::Columns	-   A multicolumn list widget with resizeable borders
                    and sorting by column.

	Tk::ComboEntry - A Drop down listbox + entry widget with nice keyboard
                    equivalent behaviour

	Tk::IconCanvas - A canvas implementing a moveable iconic interface.
                    Allows attaching menus to icons and to background.

	Tk::SplitFrame - A sliding separator for two child widgets. Allows either
                    horizontal or vertical separation between the two widgets.
                    Can work in concert as horizontal inside vertical or
                    vice-versa.

	Tk::TabFrame   - A tabbed frame geometry manager (like NoteBook).

    Tk::DockingGroup - A dockable widget management widget hierarchy. This
                       widget set only works properly on Win32. I've gotten
                       most of the functionality on Linux under KDE to work
                       but the docking stuff is still screwy. Any help here
                       would be appreciated.

    Tk::CornerBox - A textured window resizing widget (like in Win95)

    ################################################################
    # I consider the following widgets ready for use but having    #
    # behaviour that I would personally like to rewrite. I believe #
    # them to be relatively bug-free and invite you to try them out#
    ################################################################

	Tk::TabbedForm - An extended TabFrame, allowing managed subwidgets used
                     as entry fields. Each field widget is given a 'set'
                     and a 'get' method to provide widget independent
                     methods of maintaining and querying data. The form
		     will pass back a hash of all field values on request.

	Tk::TableEdit  - A compound widget built from the TabbedForm, SplitFrame,
                     and Column widgets. It implements a simplified interface
                     to a flat file database. Try out the demo.

	Tk::Menustrip  - My own menu bar. Nothing special, though.

	Tk::Signals    - A publish and subscribe object signalling method like
			 that found in QT. Very useful when widgets that are not
			 in the same hierarchy need to alert each other to various
			 application level events.

The private classes are :-

	Tk:ChildNotification - A kludge that some of the widgets use to get
                           alerted when a child widget is created. It
                           reimplements a method in Widget.pm and Derived.pm.
                           This will work in TK8.0 but hopefully something
                           will be implemented to take its place.

Bugs, suggestions, fixes, etc. can either be sent to ptk@lists.stanford.edu
or directly to myself at dkw@rcm.bm. All critiques are welcome.
