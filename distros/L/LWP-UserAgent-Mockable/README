NAME
    LWP::UserAgent::Mockable - Permits recording, and later playing back of
    LWP requests.

SYNOPSIS
    In your test code:

        # setup env vars to control behaviour, allowing them to be
        # overridden from command line.  In current case, do before
        # loading module, so will be actioned on.

        BEGIN {
            $ENV{LWP_UA_MOCK}      ||= 'playback';
            $ENV{LWP_UA_MOCK_FILE} ||= "$0-lwp-mock.out";
        }

        use LWP;
        use LWP::UserAgent::Mockable;

        # setup a callback when recording, to allow modifying the response

        LWP::UserAgent::Mockable->set_record_callback( sub {
            my ( $request, $response ) = @_;

            print "GOT REQUEST TO: " . $request->uri;
            $response->content( lc( $response->content ) );

            return $response;
        } );

        # perform LWP request, as normal

        my $ua = LWP::UserAgent->new;
        my $res = $ua->get( "http://gmail.com" );
        print $res->content;

        # when the LWP work is done, inform LWP::UserAgent::Mockable
        # that we're finished.  Will trigger any behaviour specific to
        # the action being done, such as saving the recorded session.

        END {
            # END block ensures cleanup if script dies early
            LWP::UserAgent::Mockable->finished;
        }

    To run the tests:

        # Store data
        LWP_UA_MOCK=record prove t/my-test.t

        # Use stored data
        prove t/my-test.t  # playback is default in example
        # or
        LWP_UA_MOCK=playback prove t/my-test.t

        # Re-record stored data
        LWP_UA_MOCK=record prove t/my-test.t

        # Ignore stored data
        LWP_UA_MOCK=passthrough prove t/my-test.t

DESCRIPTION
    This module adds session record and playback options for LWP requests,
    whilst trying to introduce as little clutter as necessary.

    When in record mode, all LWP requests and responses will be captured
    in-memory, until the finished method is called, at which point they will
    then be written out to a file. In playback mode, LWP responses are
    short-circuited, to instead return the responses that were previously
    dumped out. If neither of the above actions are requested, this module
    does nothing, so LWP requests are handled as normal.

    Most of the control of this module is done via environment variables,
    both to control the action being done (LWP_UA_MOCK env var, allowed
    values being 'record', 'playback', 'passthrough' (the default) ), and to
    control the file that is used for storing or replaying the responses
    (LWP_UA_MOCK_FILE env var, not used for 'passthrough' mode).

    The only mandatory change to incorporate this module is to call the
    'finished' method, to indicate that LWP processing is completed. Other
    than that, LWP handling can be done as-normal.

    As the initial impetus for this module was to allow mocking of external
    HTTP calls within unit tests, a couple of optional callback (one for
    each action of the valid action types), to allow for custom handling of
    responses, or to modify the response that is returned back to the client
    (this is useful for simulating the requested system being down, or when
    playing back, to modify the mocked response to reflect expected dynamic
    content).

  Methods
    As there is only a singleton instance of LWP::UserAgent::Mockable, all
    methods are class methods.

    finished() - required
        Informs LWP::UserAgent::Mockable that no further requests are
        expected, and allow it to do any post-processing that is required.

        When in 'record' mode, this will cause the playback file (controlled
        by LWP_UA_MOCK_FILE env var) to be created. When in 'playback' mode,
        this will issue a warning if there is still additional mocked
        responses that haven't been returned.

    set_record_callback( <sub {}> ) - optional
    set_playback_callback( <sub {}> ) - optional
        These optional methods allow custom callbacks to be inserted, when
        performing the relevant actions. The callback will be invoked for
        each LWP request, AFTER the request has been actioned (see
        set_record_pre_callback for a method o short-circuiting the LWP
        fetch). They will be passed in 2 parameters, an HTTP::Request and an
        HTTP::Response object. For the record callback (which is used for
        both 'record' and 'passthrough' mode) the request will be the
        HTTP::Request object used to perform the request, and the response
        the HTTP::Response result from that. In playback mode, the request
        will be the HTTP::Request object used to perform the request, and
        the response the mocked response object.

        When the callbacks are being used, they're expected to return an
        HTTP::Response object, which will be treated as the actual reply
        from the call being made. Failure to do do will result in a fatal
        error being raised.

        To clear a callback, call the relevant method, passing in no
        argument.

    set_record_pre_callback( <sub {}> ) - optional
        This callback is similar to set_record_callback, except that it will
        short-circuit the actual fetching of the remote URL. Only a single
        parameter is passed through to this callback, that being the
        HTTP::Request object. It's expected to construct an return an
        HTTP::Response object (or subclass thereof). Should anything other
        than an HTTP::Response subclass be returned, a fatal error will be
        raised.

        This callback will be invoked for both 'record' and 'passthrough'
        modes. Note that there is no analagous callback for 'playback' mode.

        To clear the callback, pass in no argument.

    set_playback_validation_callback( <sub {}> ) - optional
        This callback allows validation of the received request. It receives
        two parameters, both HTTP::Requests, the first being the actual
        request made, the second being the mocked request that was received
        when recording a session. It's up to the callback to do any
        validation that it wants, and to perform any action that is
        warranted.

        As with other callbacks, to clear, pass in no argument to the
        method.

    reset( <action>, <file> ) - optional
        Reset the state of mocker, allowing the action and file operation on
        to change. Will also reset all callbacks. Note that this will raise
        an error, if called whilst there are outstanding requests, and the
        finished method hasn't been called.

CAVEATS
    The playback file generated by this is not encrypted in any manner. As
    it's only using Storable to dump the file, it's easy to get at the data
    contained within, even if the requests are going to HTTPS sites. Treat
    the playback file as if it were the original data, security-wise.
