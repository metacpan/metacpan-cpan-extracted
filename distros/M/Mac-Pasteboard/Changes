    Use utf8 plain text in 10.11 El Capitan and later, and provide -t
    (traditional) and -u (utf-8) options to Makefile.PL and Build.PL.

    Thanks to Gary Greene for bringing the need for utf-8 on older systems
    to my attention, and helping me to work out the fix.

    Thanks to Neil Bowers for adding a macOS machine to CPAN Testers,
    with every production Perl back to 5.8.9.

    Get more diagnostic information out of tests, so I can have a prayer
    of diagnosing what is going on in smokers that (apparently) do not
    use UTF-8.

    Add rt.cpan.org back to bug reporting methods.

    Correct handling of non-ASCII characters.  At least, I sincerely
    hope so. Thanks to Ray Takamoto for bringing this to my attention.
    User-visible changes (aside from the obvious) include:

    * The default data flavor is now public.utf8-plain-text under macOS
      10.15 Catalina and higher.

    * By default, the encoding attribute is true under macOS 10.15 Catalina
      and higher.

    * You can now pass desired attribute values to new(), instead of
      instantiating a default object and calling set().

    * Method flavor_encoding() reports what Unicode encoding is used for a
      given pasteboard data flavor -- or the default flavor if no argument
      is specified.

    * The stopgap mods for macOS 10.15 Catalina, introduced in version
      0.010_01, are now disabled by default, since investigating this
      problem showed (I think!) what was actually going on.

    * Made sure it would actually work under Perl 5.6.2. The encoding
      functionality, though, does not work prior to Perl 5.8.4.

    Use GitHub as bug tracker. R.I.P. rt.cpan.org.

    Normally this release would include Travis CI testing, but they do
    not support Perl under macOS.

    Stopgap mods for macOS 10.15 Catalina

    The underlying problem appears to be that copy() does not put stuff on
    the public pasteboards. It puts it somewhere, though, becase paste() can
    find it, even if run in a separate process. But paste() also finds stuff
    put on the pasteboard by pbcopy (1).

    The above makes no sense to me, but I band-aided it by having copy()
    spawn pbcopy if POSIX::uname indicates that we are running under Darwin
    19 or higher.

    Tweak t/pasteboard.t do() file names.  This test does things like
    "do 't/misc.tx';", and some CPAN testers flunk this with the error
    "... '.' is no longer in @INC ...". So I accepted the error
    message's recommendation and made it './t/misc.tx'. Thanks to Karen
    Etheridge for the CPAN Testers report AND the RT ticket.

    Move bin/pbtool to script/pbtool

    Use test compile to find MacTypes.h.  I was previously explicitly
    testing for it in /usr/include/, but apparently it can live
    elsewhere and still be used.

    Eliminate unused variables in pbl.c.

    Ditch 'use base'.

    Impose minimum Perl of 5.6.2.

    Add Makefile targets authortest, testcover.

    Document script editor name change in eg/README.

     options will remain, with their present function.

  Clean up compile warnings in XS code. The most significant change here
    is a correction in the size of the pasteboard flavor flags, from
    'unsigned long' to 'unsigned int' (or equivalent).
  Add metnods default_flavor() (to override the hard-wired default) and
    encode() (to encode data to and decode data from the UTF flavors).
  Add subtroutines pbflavor(), pbflavor_find(), pbencode(), and
    pbencode_find() to do the same thing for the convenience
    subroutines.
  Support pbflavor() and pbencode() in bin/pbtool.
  Support specifying the output encoding in bin/pbtool.
  Have the pbtool script dump the flavor flags in hex.

  Document the fact that Mac::Pasteboard does not (yet) support the Mac
    OS 10.6 Snow Leopard functionality of placing more than one item on
    a pasteboard. Also document a workaround if the user is trying to
    write a droplet.
  Skip rather than fail when t/basic.t gets an error that indicates that
    we are forbidden to access the pasteboard. Enhance the skip message
    to include 'ssh session' as a possible reason for this.
