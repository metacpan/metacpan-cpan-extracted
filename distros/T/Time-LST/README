Time-LST version 0.038
=====================

A wrapper to a number of Astro::Time methods that simplifies
conversion of a datetime array (such as returned by Date::Calc),
or time in seconds since the epoch (as returned by time, or stat fields),
into local sidereal time (in hours, minutes and seconds).
Give a filepath to get the LST of its last modified time,
or see what the LST is now.
Essentially, you need to know the longitude (in degrees) of the space relevant to your time.
