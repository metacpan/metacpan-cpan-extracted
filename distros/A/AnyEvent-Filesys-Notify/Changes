Changes for AnyEvent::Filesys::Notify

1.23 - Wed Dec  6 11:19:35 EST 2017
    Cleans up CONTRIBUTORS listed in pod and addresses various author tests
    - No need to upgrade

1.22 - Tue Dec  5 16:47:23 EST 2017
    Adds new directories to watch *before* searching them for new entities.
    - When using `parse_events => 1` with inotify, there is a race condition
      where entities in a new directory could be missed. We need to add the
      new directory to the watch list before searching it for new files or
      sub-directories.
    - Reported with PR by @ufobat (GH#11). Thanks!
    - Upgrade is recommended on Linux

    Adds skip_dirs support as contributed by @kyzn

    Other minor changes:
    - Improves the diagnostic when Linux::Inotify2->new fails
    - Adds skip_dirs support as contributed by @kyzn
    - Remove 5.21 from travis build (doesn't exist)
    - Removing Mac::FSEvents in META.json

1.21 - Thu Jun 23 15:13:59 EDT 2016
    Updates KQueue to remove file handles from watch list for deleted paths
    - Addresses issue with leaking file handles. Thanks to dave@jetcafe.org.
      (RT#115562).
    - Upgrade is recommended if you use the KQueue backend.

1.20 - Fri Jun 17 13:59:05 EDT 2016
    Runs bug test against KQueue if possible; improves comments
    - Ensures files are added to watch before calling in callback (RT#115380)
      Files that were modified in the callback were sometimes not added to the
      watch list first (specifically in KQueue and Inotify2). This patch
      ensures that files/directories are added to the watch before the callback
      is called. Thanks to Dave Hayes <dave@jetcafe.org> for the bug report.
    - If you modified _process_events (a private method) this could break your
      code.
    - Upgrade is recommended if you use the KQueue or Inotify2 backends.

1.19 - Tue May 26 15:20:03 EDT 2015
    - Converts utility functions to methods to support subclassing (RT#104714).
      The use of local functions (rather than methods) makes subclassing
      more difficult. This change converts all utility functions in Notify.pm
      to methods. Thanks to Dave Hayes for submitting RT#104714.
    - Any users attempting to subclass should consider upgrading.

1.18 - Wed May 20 20:27:58 EDT 2015
    - Adds version to some files which were missing it
    - No change in functionality. No need to upgrade.

1.17 - Wed May 20 08:07:04 EDT 2015
    - Switches from namespace::sweep to namespace::autoclean (RT#104554).
      autoclean no longer depends on Class::MOP (a heavy prereq).
      Thanks to Karen Etheridge (ether++) for report.
    - No change in functionality. No need to upgrade.

1.16 - Fri Feb 27 13:38:46 EST 2015
    - Rewrites the test functions to accommodate optional events
      Parsing events from Inotify2 (instead of re-scanning) results in
      extraneous modifications in some situations. Tests shouldn't fail if
      these optional events are triggered.

1.15 - Fri Aug 15 20:14:38 EDT 2014
    - Adds minimum version of perl to the prereqs

1.12 - Sun Dec 22 14:04:39 EST 2013
    - Uses KQueue on any BSD RT#91556

1.11 - Wed Dec 11 08:59:54 EST 2013
    - Uses IO::KQueue on all freebsd-like systems (ie, gnufreebsd).
    - Fixes minor POD linking problem.

1.10 - Tue Dec 10 11:42:06 EST 2013
    - If the parse_events flag is set, use events from Inotify2 instead of
      rescanning all files (RT#82847).  Thanks to Carsten Wolff
      <carsten@wolffcarsten.de> for the patch.
    - Generates 'created' events for files in a new subdirs when parsing events.
      This ensures that we don't miss any.
    - Refactors the test routines to improve reliability and increase code
      reuse.

0.24 - Fri Oct  4 11:44:42 EDT 2013
    - Makes an official release of after converting to Moo. CPANTesters didn't
      seem to have any issues with the conversion. Hopefully this change will
      be seemless for users.

0.23_10 - Mon Sep 30 20:06:50 EDT 2013
    EXPERIMENTAL DEVELOPERS RELEASE

    - Attempts to convert from Moose to Moo for our OO infrastructure. We
      don't need much of Moose's power, so let's take advantage of Moo's speed.
    - Adds version requirements to the prereqs. Earlier version of some of
      the prereq seemed to produce an unstable result. Current versions seem
      fine.
    - Fixes Changes file to adhere to CPAN::Changes spec
    - Replaces namespace::autoclean with namespace::sweep as
      namespace::autoclean relies on Class::MOP

0.22 - Tue Mar  5 14:15:44 EST 2013
    - This is an important release for KQueue users. Prior versions had several
      bugs in the KQueue backend. As a result, KQueue was effectively polling
      the filesystem with no delay. KQueue has a serious limitation which makes
      it impractical for monitoring medium to large sets of files (namely, you
      need an open filehandle for each directory AND file that you are
      monitoring). The use of the KQueue backend is discouraged.

    - Fixes KQueue backend bug which causes CPU usage to peg at 100%
      (thank to gdxhsw++ for the bug report and patch)
    - Updates the documentation and issue warnings for KQueue filehandles
    - Fixes errors in documentation
    - Adds namespace::autoclean to the Event object

0.21 - Mon Feb  4 15:52:47 EST 2013
    - Converts from File::Find::Rule to Path::Interator::Rule
      - Should speed things up marginally.
      - Adds benchmark and profiling tools
    - Marks tests as TODO if we are on gnufreebsd or gnukfreebsd
      - Based on diag output, tests appear to work, but we get failures from
        cpantesters. I don't have access to this platform to investigate
        further.

0.19 - Mon Jan 14 20:30:38 EST 2013
    - Fixes KQueue bugs.  This works on a Mac, hoping it will work on FreeBSD.

0.18 - Thu Jan 10 10:39:22 EST 2013
    - Fixes non-mac bug where 'plan' is called twice.
      Thanks to syohex for the patch.

0.17 - Wed Jan  9 19:53:53 EST 2013
    - Renames backend roles to reflect the implementation rather than the O/S
      (Inotify2, FSEvents and KQueue)
    - Adds the 'backend' argument to the constructor allow the user to force
      a particular backend
    - Guides the user to avoid no_external in the docs

0.15 - Wed Dec  5 12:01:07 EST 2012
    - Skips attribute modification tests on Win32.

0.14 - Tue Nov 27 08:58:47 EST 2012

    - Checks of Kqueue from TODO list

0.12 - Wed Nov 21 08:22:55 EST 2012
    - Fixes missing file in MANIFEST and bumps versions

0.11 - Tue Nov 20 11:27:16 EST 2012
    - Adds kqueue support and test on FreeBSD. Thanks to Gasol Wu
      <gasol.wu@gmail.com> who provided the well done patch.

0.10 - Tue Nov 20 10:57:28 EST 2012

    - Updates README with current year in copyright

0.08 - Tue Oct 16 12:08:22 EDT 2012

      - Adds a timeout to the test scripts

0.06 - Wed Dec 14 17:24:52 EST 2011
    - Implemented a fix for RT#72849 (excessive warnings if there are broken
      symlinks on ext4)

0.05 - Mon Feb  8 18:47:45 2010
    - Fixed bug in AFN::Event, where is_dir was incorrectly typed.

      directories.
    - Other minor cleanup.

0.03 - Fri Dec 11 08:55:30 2009
    - Added namespace::autoclean and switched to apply_all_roles. This gives us
      true per-instance application of backends (Inotify/FSEvents/Fallback).

0.02 - Thu Dec 10 11:53:37 2009
    - Initial release on CPAN
