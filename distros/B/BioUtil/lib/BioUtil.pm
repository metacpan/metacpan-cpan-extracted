=head1 NAME

BioUtil - Bioinformatics Utilities!

Some great modules like BioPerl provide many robust solutions. 
However, it is not easy to install for someone in some platforms.
And for some simple task scripts, a lite module may be a good choice.
So I reinvented some wheels and added some useful utilities into this module,
hoping it would be helpful.

Please check the submodules.
