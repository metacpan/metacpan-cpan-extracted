You can install this using in the usual Perl fashion

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install
	
The documentation is in the module file.  Once you install
the file, you can read it with perldoc.

	perldoc Surveyor::Benchmark::HTMLEntities
	
If you want to read it before you install it, you can use
perldoc directly on the module file.

	perldoc  lib/
	
This module is also in Github:

	http://github.com/briandfoy/surveyor-benchmark-htmlentities
