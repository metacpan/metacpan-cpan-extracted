Usage information: this package was designed around gtk 0.99.8, and there is
no guarantee it will work with any other distributions, or indeed even that
one. To build, install Gtk in your system, then run 'perl Makefile.PL', and
'make test', and then 'make install' if all went well.

You may optionally run Makefile.PL with the --with-gdkimlib and/or
--with-gnome switches to enable use of some Gtk widgets and Gdk functions
available in those packages.

Gtk is available at <ftp://ftp.gimp.org/pub/gtk/>.

The code may very well still have leaks, and a few portions are incomplete
(such as Gdk colormap manipulation) and much of it is untested. As a point
of fact, I know that several parts of object deallocation and tracking are
broken, and may not be fixed for some time. No documentation currently
exists, but this code is designed to mimic the C calling sequences as much
as is reasonable.

A major file reorganization happened with 0.1.13, hopefully making the
module easier to work with, and add widgets to, but it may turn out to break
with older Perl installations.

If you have been using Gtk-0.1.8, several changes have been made to the API,
including the change of enumeration and flag values to lowercase (to match
the constants defined in gtk.defs), and the requirement for Gtk->init() to
be invoked before any other Gtk functions.

Please bring information regarding bugs and other issues to
<gtk-list@redhat.com> (before posting, you will need to subscribe to the
list by sending 'subscribe' to gtk-list-request@redhat.com) or the author,
at <kjahds@kjahds.com>. I cannot guarantee, at the moment, that any
particular problem will be fixed.

Good Luck,
Ken
