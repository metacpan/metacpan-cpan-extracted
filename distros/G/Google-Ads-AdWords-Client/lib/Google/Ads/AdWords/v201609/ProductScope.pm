Google::Ads::AdWords::v201609::ProductScope

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Perl data type class for the XML Schema defined complexType
ProductScope from the namespace https://adwords.google.com/api/adwords/cm/v201609.

These product dimensions must have a value; the "everything else" case without a value is not allowed. <p>If there is no {@code ProductScope}, all products are included in the campaign. If a campaign has more than one {@code ProductScope}, products are included as long as they match any. Campaigns of {@link AdvertisingChannelType#SHOPPING} can have at most one {@code ProductScope}. <span class="constraint AdxEnabled">This is disabled for AdX when it is contained within Operators: ADD, SET.</span>
