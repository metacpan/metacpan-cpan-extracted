DESCRIPTIONS
    The "File::Revision" program modules provides the name of a non-existing
    file with a revision identifier based on the a file name $file. This has
    many uses backup file uses. There are no restrictions on the number of
    backup files or the time to live of the backup files.

    A typical use would be to create a backup file for If the revised file
    passes does not pass all validity checks, use the backup file to replace
    or repair the revised file. This minimizes loses import data when
    revising files.

    Better yet, create a temporary file, using one of the temp file name
    program modules. Revise the temp file. Once it passes all valitity
    checks, rename the original file to the backup file and rename the temp
    file to the original file. This allows full use of the original file
    until a validated revison is ready to replace it.

    The "File::Revision" program module also supports limiting the backup
    files and delete the oldest once "File::Revision" reaches the rotation
    limit.

SUBROUTINES
  new_revision

     ($file_name, $next_revsion) = new_revision($file, @options);

    The "new_revision" subroutine returns the name of a non-existing file by
    appending revision letters to the base name of a supplied file. The
    supplied file usually exists.

  num2revsion

     $revision = num2revsion($number)

    The "num2revision" is the inverse of "revision2num" as described below.

  parse_options

     $options = parse_options($file, @options);

    The "parse_options" subroutine pre-process the options and used
    internally by the other routines. The only external ues is as an input
    to the "revision_file" subroutine.

    The "rotate" and "new_revision" subroutine embeds the revision in the
    "$file" input to produce the "$file_name" output as follows:

     "$vol$dir$base$pre_revision$lead_revision$revision$ext"

    The "$vol $dir $base $ext" are obtained from the "$file" input but may
    be overrided by the options "vol dir base ext". The $pre_revision is the
    "pre_revision" option and has a default of '-'. The "$lead_revision"
    comes in play when a the "places" option has a number. It contains just
    enough characters so that "places" revision is exactly

     length(($lead_revision$revision")

    The "lead_revision" default to a '_' for drafing style letter revisions
    and '0' for numeric revisions.

                   (rotate subroutine only)

     vol           overide the $file_name vol

  revision2num

     $number = revision2num($revision)

    The "revision2num" subroutine converts a drawing revision letter(s) that
    complies to American industry, US DOD, and International drawing
    practices to a number, where 0 is the drawing release, 1 the 1st
    revision, 2 the 2nd revision and so forth.

    The old DOD-STD-100C which itself cited a slew of American National
    Standards, may itself been superceded by an American National Standard.
    Anyway drawing revisions are pretty the same across commerical, military
    and national boundaries. The US Navy provides DOD-STD-100C free.
    However, comericalized American Nation Standards are not so generous.
    They do not have the American taxpayer to support their generosity.

    DOD-Std-100C 5003.2, Drawing Practices, states

    '5003.2 Revision Letters. Upper-case letters shall be used in
    alphabetical sequence. The letters "I", "O", "Q", "S', "X" and "Z" shall
    be omitted. When revisions are numberous enough to exhaust the alphabet
    the revision following Y shall be "AA" and the next "AB", the "AC", etc.
    Revision letters shall not exceed two characters. The first revision to
    a drawing shall be assigned the letter A. Release (initial issue) of a
    drawing does not constitute a need for a revision letter.'

    The convention is to use rev - for the initial release. The requirement
    that the revision does not exceed two letters, maximum of 400 revisions,
    is not realistic for automation of drawings. The revision for index
    drawings that index large databases can easy exceed this very quickly.

    During the development of software programs, there can easily be more
    than 400 builds. When this happens, for strcit compliance, the drawing
    had to be rolled over to a new drawing and start out with rev -. Isn't
    more sensible to allow more than two letters for revisions, especially
    since it is easy to convert revision letters into a number.

    When using hard paper media, 400 revisions never exist. Management
    lowers the hammer about revision MN. They fire the development team and
    bring in a new one.

    Once there was a software engineer (SE) working on a Laser Printer and
    the lead mechanical engineer (ME) came it and starting examining a part.
    The SE asked him why he was looking so intensely at that part. The ME
    replied that they where going to revise it. SE: "Whey are you revising
    it?" ME: "It is the only part that has not been changed." That is funny
    unless you are the manager paying for it.

    The standard drawing revision conventions is an interesting number
    system with no symbol for zero (absence of a revision is zero) and is
    base 20. The Persians successfully argued that the lack of a zero makes
    the arith twisted back in what is now Iran, Iraq around 600 A.D.
    However, the drafing disciplines never went along with this concept.
    Maybe they feel a symbol for zero makes the arith twisted. Anyway with
    non-zero digit arith there are additions and subtractions of one to
    shift around numbers to line up with the computer arith which uses arith
    with a zero symbol.

    Actually this is being unkind. The reason drafting uses letters is
    because they are trying to make it hard to confuse the drawing revision
    with the drawing number. Then again, the American drafting standards and
    Internationl drafting standards allow letters in the drawing number. In
    other words, do not tried to understand drafting standards or make sense
    out of them. Just live with them.

    Take a look at a base 4 number system without zero.

  revision_file

      $file_name = revision_file($revision_number, parse_options($file, @options));

    The "revision_file" subroutine returns the backup file name for "$file"
    with the "$revision_number" embedded. This subroutine does not check to
    see if the "$file_name" exists. The "rotate" and "new_revision"
    subroutines use it extensively internally.

  rotate

     $file_name = rotate($file, @options);

    The "rotate" subroutine returns is similar to the "new_file" subroutine
    except that it uses "rotate" as the highest revision that will be
    embedded in $file_name. When the subroutine finds that the highest
    revision file exists, it unlinks the oldest revision and rotates the
    rest of the files by renaming them to the next lowest revision. The
    subroutine returns the a "$file_name" with the vacated "rotate" revision
    embedded in the name.

QUALITY ASSURANCE
    Running the test script "Revision.t" verifies the requirements for this
    module. The "tmake.pl" cover script for Test::STDmaker automatically
    generated the "Revision.t" test script, "Revision.d" demo script, and
    "t::File::Revision" STD program module POD, from the "t::File::Revision"
    program module contents. The "tmake.pl" cover script automatically ran
    the "Startup.d" demo script and inserted the results into the
    'DEMONSTRATION' section above. The "t::File::Revision" program module is
    in the distribution file File-Revision-$VERSION.tar.gz.

  3.3 Changes

    The changes to the previous version are as follows:

    File-Revision-0.01
        Originated.

    File-Revision-0.02
        Bad problems with "$options" being init. Seems running with Exporter
        masks problems. Need to make sure make a dry run without Exporter
        between final distribution run, and triple check with Exporter.

    File-Revision-0.03
        In the "parse_options" subroutine, supply an revision if there is
        none. Also make sure pick out a valid revision when from the
        revision string.

  3.4 Adaptation data.

    This installation requires that the installation site has the Perl
    programming language installed. There are no other additional
    requirements or tailoring needed of configurations files, adaptation
    data or other software needed for this installation particular to any
    installation site.

  3.5 Related documents.

    There are no related documents needed for the installation and test of
    this release.

  3.7 Possible problems and known errors

    There is still much work needed to ensure the quality of this module as
    follows:

    *   State the functional requirements for each method including not only
        the GO paths but also what to expect for the NOGO paths

    *   All the tests are GO path tests. Should add NOGO tests.
