NAME
    CatalystX::TraitFor::Dispatcher::ExactMatch - handle trailing slashes
    properly

SYNOPSIS
       package MyApp;
   
       use Catalyst::Runtime 5.80;
       use Catalyst qw/
          -Debug
          Static::Simple
          /;
       use CatalystX::RoleApplicator;
   
       __PACKAGE__->apply_dispatcher_class_roles(
          qw/CatalystX::TraitFor::Dispatcher::ExactMatch/
       );

DESCRIPTION
    The Catalyst dispatcher doesn't differentiate between:

    `http://localhost:3000/foo`
    `http://localhost:3000/foo/`

    Not even with Regex dispatching. Not even by writing a custom dispatch
    type.

    This is apparently a "feature". As far as I'm concerned, it's a bug.

    This trait for Catalyst::Dispatcher attempts to perform an exact match,
    including trailing slashes, ahead of Catalyst's default dispatching. It's
    not been tested in every possible configuration, but it works for me.

BUGS
    Please report any bugs to
    <http://rt.cpan.org/Dist/Display.html?Queue=CatalystX-TraitFor-Dispatcher-
    ExactMatch>.

SEE ALSO
    CatalystX::RoleApplicator, Catalyst::Dispatcher.

    Catalyst::Plugin::SanitizeUrl appears to do something similar for
    pre-Moose versions of Catalyst.
