NAME
       Template::Plugin::Filter::MinifyHTML - HTML minification filter for Template Toolkit

VERSION
       version 0.01

SYNOPSIS
         [% USE Filter.MinifyHTML( comments => 1, html5 => 1 ) %]

         [% FILTER minify_html %]
         <html>...Your html content here...</html>
         [% END %]

DESCRIPTION
       This is a Template Toolkit filter which uses a few quick and nasty regexes to minify HTML source code. It’s built upon the idea/workings
       of the default ’collapse’ filter, but adds a little spice of its own into the mix, removing HTML comments and a few other bits and
       pieces.

USAGE
       Be sure to [% USE Filter.MinifyHTML %] in your template, then you're able to wrap [% FILTER minify_html %][% END %] around blocks that you would like to minify.

       Filter.MinyfyHTML can currently take two arguments - comments and html5.
       
       If comments is set to a truesy value it will remove any HTML comments it finds (<!-- ... -->). It shouldn't affect any conditional comments in your markup (ie. <!--[if lt IE 9]><link href="/static/css/custom-ie.css" rel="stylesheet"><![endif]-->).

      If html5 is truesy, then it will remove the trailing slash on self-closing elements (<br />, <input />, etc).

BUYER BEWARE
       This filter does not check for or acknowledge the existence or importance of tags such as <pre> or <textarea>. As such, any whitespace
       within these tags *WILL* be royally messed up by this module in its current state.
