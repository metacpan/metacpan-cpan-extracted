NAME
    maybe - Use a Perl module and ignore error if can't be loaded

SYNOPSIS
      use Getopt::Long;
      use maybe 'Getopt::Long::Descriptive';
      if (maybe::HAVE_GETOPT_LONG_DESCRIPTIVE) {
        Getopt::Long::Descriptive::describe_options("usage: %c %o", @options);
      }
      else {
        Getopt::Long::GetOptions(\%options, @$opt_spec);
      }

      use maybe 'Carp' => 'confess';
      if (maybe::HAVE_CARP) {
        confess("Bum!");
      }
      else {
        die("Bum!");
      }

DESCRIPTION
    This pragma loads a Perl module. If the module can't be loaded, the
    error will be ignored. Otherwise, the module's import method is called
    with unchanged caller stack.

    The special constant `maybe::HAVE_*MODULE*' is created and it can be
    used to enable or disable block of code at compile time.
