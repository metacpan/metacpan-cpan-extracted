Object-InsideOut version 4.04
=============================

This module provides comprehensive support for implementing classes using the
inside-out object model.

This module implements inside-out objects as anonymous scalar references that
are blessed into a class with the scalar containing the ID for the object
(usually a sequence number).  Object data (i.e., fields) are stored within the
class's package in either arrays indexed by the object's ID, or hashes keyed
to the object's ID.

The virtues of the inside-out object model over the 'blessed hash' object
model have been extolled in detail elsewhere.  Briefly, inside-out objects
offer the following advantages over 'blessed hash' objects:

* Encapsulation

Object data is enclosed within the class's code and is accessible only through
the class-defined interface.

* Field Name Collision Avoidance

Inheritance using 'blessed hash' classes can lead to conflicts if any classes
use the same name for a field (i.e., hash key).  Inside-out objects are immune
to this problem because object data is stored inside each class's package, and
not in the object itself.

* Compile-time Name Checking

A common error with 'blessed hash' classes is the misspelling of field names:

    $obj->{'coment'} = 'No comment';   # Should be 'comment' not 'coment'

As there is no compile-time checking on hash keys, such errors do not usually
manifest themselves until runtime.

With inside-out objects, data is accessed using methods, the names of which
are checked by the Perl compiler such that any typos are easily caught using
"perl -c".


This module offers all the capabilities of other inside-out object modules
with the following additional key advantages:

* Speed

When using arrays for storing object data, Object::InsideOut objects are as
much as 40% faster than 'blessed hash' objects for fetching and setting data,
and even with hashes they are still several percent faster than 'blessed hash'
objects.

* Threads

Object::InsideOut is thread safe, and thoroughly supports sharing objects
between threads using threads::shared.

* Flexibility

Allows control over object ID specification, accessor naming, parameter name
matching, and more.

* 'Runtime' Support

Supports classes that may be loaded at runtime (i.e., using "eval { require
...; };").  This makes it usable from within mod_perl, as well.  Also supports
additions to class hierarchies, and dynamic creation of object fields during
runtime.

* Perl 5.6

Tested on Perl v5.6.0 through v5.6.2, v5.8.0 through v5.8.8, and v5.9.3.

* Exception Objects

As recommended in "Perl Best Practices", Object::InsideOut uses
Exception::Class for handling errors in an OO-compatible manner.

* Object Serialization

Object::InsideOut has built-in support for object dumping and reloading that
can be accomplished in either an automated fashion or through the use of
class-supplied subroutines.  Serialization using 'Storable' is also supported.

* Foreign Class Inheritance

Object::InsideOut allows classes to inherit from foreign (i.e.,
non-Object::InsideOut) classes, thus allowing you to sub-class other Perl
class, and access their methods from your own objects.

* Introspection

Obtain constructor parameters and method metadata for Object::InsideOut
classes.
