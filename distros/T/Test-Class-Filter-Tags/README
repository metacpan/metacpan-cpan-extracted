NAME
    Test::Class::Filter::Tags - Selectively run only a subset of Test::Class
    tests that inclusde/exclude the specified tags.

SYNOPSIS
     # define a test baseclass, to avoid boilerplate

     package MyTests::Base;

     # load the filter class.  This will both add the filter to Test::Class, as
     # well as importing the 'Tags' attribute into the current namespace

     use Test::Class::Filter::Tags

     # and, of course, inherit from Test::Class;

     use base qw( MyTests::Base );

     1;


     package MyTests::Wibble;

     # using custom baseclass, don't have to worry about importing attribute
     # class for each test

     use Base qw( Test::Class );

     # can specify both Test and Tags attributes on test methods

     sub t_foo : Test( 1 ) Tags( quick fast ) {
     }

     sub t_bar : Test( 1 ) Tags( loose ) {
     }

     sub t_baz : Test( 1 ) Tags( fast ) {
     }

     1;


     #
     # in Test::Class driver script, or your Test::Class baseclass
     #

     # load the test classes, in whatever manner you normally use
     use MyTests::Wibble;

     $ENV{ TEST_TAGS } = 'quick,loose';

     Test::Class->runtests;

     # from the test above, only t_foo and t_bar methods would be run, the
     # first because it has the 'quick' tag, and the second becuase it has
     # 'loose' tag.  t_baz doesn't have either tag, so it's not run.

     # Alternatively, can specify TEST_TAGS_SKIP, in a similar fashion,
     # to *not* run tests with the specified tags

DESCRIPTION
    When used in conjunction with Test::Class tests, that also define
    Attribute::Method::Tags tags, this class allows filtering of the tests
    that will be run.

    If $ENV{ TEST_TAGS } is set, it will be treated as a list of tags,
    seperated by any combination of whitespace or commas. The tests that
    will be run will only be the subset of tests that have at least of one
    these tags specified.

    Conversely, you may want to run all tests that *don't* have specific
    tags. This can be done by specifying the tags to exclude in $ENV{
    TEST_TAGS_SKIP }.

    Note that, as per normal Test::Class behaviour, only normal tests will
    be filtered. Any fixture tests (startup, shutdown, setup and teardown)
    will still be run, where appropriate, whether they have the given
    attributes or not.

IMPORTS
    By using this class, you'll get the 'Tags' attribute imported into your
    namespace. This is required to be able to add Tags attribute to your
    test methods. This will also cause Attribute::Method::Tags to be
    pre-pended to the ISA of the using class.

METHODS
    method_has_tag( $class, $method, $tag )
        Returns a true value if $tag is defined on $method in $class, or any
        of $class'es super-classes. This may sound of limited use, but one
        of the use cases presented to me when developing this module was to
        have setup fixtures conditionally run if the method that's being
        tested has a specific tag.

TAGS ADDITIVE OVER INHERITANCE
    When inheriting from test classes, the subclasses will adopt any tags
    that the superclass methods have, in addition to any that they specify.
    (ie, tags are addative, when subclass and superclass have the same
    method with different tags, the tags for the subclass method will be
    those from both).

SEE ALSO
    Test::Class
        This class is implemented via the Test::Class filtering mechanism.

    Attributes::Method::Tag
        This class supplies the 'Tags' attribute to consuming classes. Note
        that this will alsp be pre-pended to the @ISA for any consuming
        class.
