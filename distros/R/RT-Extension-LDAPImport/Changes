Revision history for RT-Extension-LDAPImport

0.36 2014-09-22
 - Update documenation to no imply RT -> LDAP syncing
 - Allow importing of users as-needed when importing groups
 - Don't attempt to add disabled users into groups they already belong
   to
 - Treat undef and empty CF values identically
 - Ensure that user custom fields are applied in consistent order
 - Updated packaging

0.35
 - Implement better way to use functions in mappings. Old way was mostly
 - useless. It's not expected that somebody used them. See description of
 - C<$LDAPMapping> option for details.
 - Adds id to $LDAPGroupMapping to allow the importer to keep up with group
 - renames in LDAP.
 - Change tests to be author-only because they tended to cause confusion
   and
 - attempt to create/drop a database.  This is not something you want
   happening
 - on your production machine when using a cpan client to install.
