NAME
    Module::Require

SYNOPSIS
     use Module::Require qw: require_regex require_glob :;

     require_regex q[DBD::.*];
     require_regex qw[DBD::.* Foo::Bar_.*];
     require_glob qw[DBD::* Foo::Bar_*];
     walk_inc sub { m{(/|^)Bar_.*$} and return $_ }, undef, q"DBD";

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides a way to load in a series of modules without having
    to know all the names, but just the pattern they fit. This can be useful
    for allowing drop-in modules for application expansion without requiring
    configuration or prior knowledge.

    The regular expression and glob wildcards can only match the filename of
    the module, not the directory in which it resides. So, for example,
    "Apache::*" will load all the modules that begin with "Apache::",
    including "Apache::Session", but will not load "Apache::Session::MySQL".
    Likewise, *::Session is not allowed since the variable part of the
    module name is not in the last component.

    Note that unlike the Perl "require" keyword, quoting or leaving an
    argument as a bareword does not affect how the function behaves.

FUNCTIONS
    walk_inc \&filter \&todo 'path'
        This function will walk through @INC and pass each filename under
        "path::" to &filter. If &filter returns a defined value, the
        returned value is then passed to the &todo function. The default
        path is '' (the empty string). The default filter function is to
        return the argument. The default todo function is to load the
        module.

        For example,

          print join "\n", walk_inc;

        will try to load all the available modules, printing a list of
        modules that could not be loaded. Note that files and directories
        beginning with a period (`.') are not considered.

          walk_inc sub { /^X/ and return $_ }, undef, 'Foo';

        will try and load all the modules in the "Foo::" namespace that
        begin with an `X', recursively.

        Module files should end with ".pm" and directories otherwise. This
        allows for an easy way to keep "walk_inc" from descending
        directories. The filter function may also be used to transform
        module names.

        If the module is already in %INC it will be passed over.

    require_regex
        This function takes a list of files and searches @INC trying to find
        all possible modules. Only the last part of the module name should
        be the regex expression ("Foo::Bar_.*" is allowed, but "F.*::Bar" is
        not). Each file found and successfully loaded is added to %INC. Any
        file already in %INC is not loaded. No "import" functions are
        called.

        The function will return a list of files found but not loaded or, in
        a scalar context, the number of such files. This is the opposite of
        the sense of "require", with true meaning at least one file failed
        to load.

    require_glob
        This function behaves the same as the "require_regex" function
        except it uses the glob operator (<>) instead of regular
        expressions.
