0.11 Initializing the encryption system will call ask_pass twice.
     Because it needs to have a password that is completely correct.

0.10 ask_pass will always return 'undef' now if the given password
     is the empty string "".

0.09 Encryption through tickets using a different scheme.
     Instead of beginning all encryptions with the string 'crypted',
     it starts with a random sequence of 6 bytes, which is repeated.
     The decryption algorithm checks if the first and the second
     6 bytes are the same.

0.08 Documentation change; Minor bug with decrypting rsa private solved.
     Delete all variables in the bag if account is deleted.

0.07 Added BAG functionality to the Aut Framework. Through 
     Aut, configuration items can be set for a ticket.

0.06 Fixed a flaw in the ticket_all_admin_get() routine.
     This routine must check the validity of the given
     password for the RSA Private key, otherwise the underlying
     routine will give an error message for each account in the
     database.

0.05 The first meaningfull functional Aut Framework.

0.02 Small bugfix.
