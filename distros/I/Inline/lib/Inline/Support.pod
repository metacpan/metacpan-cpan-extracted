=head1 NAME

Inline-Support - Support Information for Inline.pm and related modules.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document contains all of the latest support information for C<Inline.pm>
and the recognized Inline Language Support Modules (ILSMs) available on CPAN.

=head1 SUPPORTED LANGUAGES

The most important language that Inline supports is C<C>. That is because Perl
itself is written in C<C>. By giving a your Perl scripts access to C<C>, you
in effect give them access to the entire glorious internals of Perl. (Caveat
scriptor :-)

As of this writing, Inline also supports:

=over

=item * C++

=item * Java

=item * Python

=item * Tcl

=item * Assembly

=item * CPR

=item * And even Inline::Foo! :)

=back

Projects that I would most like to see happen in the year 2001 are:

=over

=item * Fortran

=item * Ruby

=item * Lisp

=item * Guile

=item * Bash

=item * Perl4

=back

=head1 SUPPORTED PLATFORMS

C<Inline::C> should work anywhere that CPAN extension modules (those that use
XS) can be installed, using the typical install format of:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

It has been tested on many Unix and Windows variants.

B<NOTE>: C<Inline::C> requires Perl 5.005 or higher because
C<Parse::RecDescent> requires it. (Something to do with the C<qr> operator)

Inline has been successfully tested at one time or another on the following
platforms:

=over

=item * Linux

=item * Solaris

=item * SunOS

=item * HPUX

=item * AIX

=item * FreeBSD

=item * OpenBSD

=item * BeOS

=item * OS X

=item * WinNT

=item * Win2K

=item * WinME

=item * Win98

=item * Cygwin

=back

The Microsoft tests deserve a little more explanation. I used the following:

=over

=item * Windows NT 4.0 (service pack 6)

=item * Perl 5.005_03 (ActiveState build 522)

=item * MS Visual C++ 6.0

=item * The "nmake" make utility (distributed w/ Visual C++)

=back

C<Inline::C> pulls all of its base configuration (including which C<make>
utility to use) from C<Config.pm>. Since your MSWin32 version of Perl probably
came from ActiveState (as a binary distribution) the C<Config.pm> will
indicate that C<nmake> is the system's C<make> utility. That is because
ActiveState uses Visual C++ to compile Perl.

To install C<Inline.pm> (or any other CPAN module) on MSWin32 w/ Visual C++,
use these:

    perl Makefile.PL
    nmake
    nmake test
    nmake install

Inline has also been made to work with Mingw32/gcc on all Windows platforms.
This is a free compiler for Windows. You must also use a perl built with
that compiler.

The "Cygwin" test was done on a Windows 98 machine using the Cygwin Unix/Win32
porting layer software from Cygnus. The C<perl> binary on this machine was
also compiled using the Cygwin tool set (C<gcc>). This software is freely
available from L<http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin/>

If you get Inline to work on a new platform, please send me email email. If it
doesn't work, let me know as well and I'll see what can be done.
