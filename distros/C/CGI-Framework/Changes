Revision history for Perl module CGI::Framework

0.23
	- New initializer parameter "output_filter"
	- show_template accepts a second optional boolean parameter
	  "nofinalize" which denotes it should not finalize() when done.
	  This was used to bugfix fatal error emails not being sent out
	  when not running under mod_perl

0.22
	- Fatal errors sent via sendmail now also try to respect supplied
	  smtp_from parameter

0.21
	- Tweaked code that handles braindead browsers that do not properly
	  terminate an SSL/TLS session.  This used to generated a fatal
	  error (email and all) in some cases.  Now it's ignored silently.

0.20
	- Fatal error email now includes X-CGI-Framework-PID header

0,19
	- Minor bugfix - the fatal_error_template was shown to the user as
	  text/plain instead of text/html if application was running under
	  mod_perl and sendmail was used to email fatal error messages.

0.18
	- pre__pre__all(), pre__post__all(), post__pre__all() and
	  post__post__all() are now all passed a second argument:  The name
	  of the template about to be/just sent.

0.17
	- The "process" javascript function now returns false, so its return
	  value can be utilized in "onclick" events of anchors to avoid the
	  "screen-scroll-to-top" abnormality.

0.16
	- Implemented new constructor parameters: sessions_serializer_default,
	  sessions_serializer_freezethaw and sessions_serializer_storable
	- Bugfix - running under mod_perl resulted in occasional "Software
	  caused connection abort" messages.  These are no longer considered
	  fatal.
	
0.15
	- No longer tries to write and unlink a testing file to sessions_dir
	  for every invocation
	- Fatal error messages now have a stack backtrace appended to them
	- Bugfix: Fatal errors are no longer sent to browser below the fatal
	  error template content when running under mod_perl

0.14
	- Errors emailed via fatal_error_email now include header
	  X-CGI-Framework-REMOTE-ADDR
	- Implemented new constructor parameters: action and cookie_domain
	- Bugfix: A weird error produced if a submitted form has the element
	  _lang more than once is now avoided
	- Some minor changes to make the framework work under mod_perl: Also
	  introduced new method finalize()

0.13
	- Implemented new constructor parameter: expire
	- log_this now also logs the IP address from REMOTE_ADDR
	- Internal HTML::Template object is now initialized with option
	  loop_context_vars, allowing for loop vars such as __odd__
	  and __inner__

0.12
	- Implemented support for 4 new callbacks:
	    pre__pre__all()
	    post__pre__all()
	    pre__post__all()
	    post__post__all()

0.11
	- Implemented new method: return_template()
	- Implemented 2 new special variables: _missing_info and
	  _missing_info_caller
   - Calling the clear_session() method will now preserve
	  the internal _lang and _lastsent variables

0.10
   - Implemented new logic that fixes problem of the framework validating
	  the last-sent template even if the client hit BACK in their web browser
	  and is actually submitting a different template.  The default is now
	  to validate whichever template the client is submitting, which is not
	  necessarily the last template sent.
	- Added new constructor option: disable_back_button
	  Note that this constructor replicates the behavior of version 0.09
	  and below.  Unlike the previous versions, the default for
	  version 0.10 is NOT to disable the back button.

	  If you'd like to maintain the behavior of version 0.09 and
	  earlier, you must set "disable_back_button => 1" in your
	  constructor/initializer.

	  See the POD for more details.

0.09
	- Fixed a bug that caused language tags in a template with no content
	  in them (such as <en></en>) to cause random parsing problems and
	  missing content.
	- Introduced internationalization and localization to errors added
	  via the add_error() method by utilizing the excellent Locale::Maketext
	  module.
	- Documentation clarification for multi-language support

0.08
	- Added new method initial_template()

0.07
	- Implemented new logging features:
		+ log_filename constructor key
		+ log_this() method
	- Implemented new fatal error handling features:
		+ Fatal error template through the new fatal_error_template constructor key
		+ Fatal error email-to-admin feature through the new fatal_error_email,
		  sendmail, smtp_host and smtp_from constructor keys as well as the
		  new pre-defined variable _fatal_error for use in the fatal error template
	- New pre-defined variable _current_template

0.06
	- Renamed constructor parameter importform to import_form, renamed built-in
	  html variable _formaction to _form_action.  Both changes are backwards compatible
	- If "import_form" was supplied to constructor, then subsequent calls to the
	  form() method will return the value from the import_form namespace instead of
	  from the built-in CGI object.  This allows the programmer to modify the value
	  in the namespace (such as $FORM::firstname) then use form() or remember() to
	  operate on the new value, not the original one.
	- add_error() method no longer restricted to being called from inside a
	  validate_templatename() routine.  That gives the flexibility to add_error()
	  followed by manually calling show_template() at any time.
	- The INITIALIZENEWPROJECT function now creates an /images/ subdirectory
	  inside the /public_html/ subdirectory and places a couple of small images in
	  it, which the errors.html template references. It looks nicer :)

0.05
	- Fixed a bug that caused the framework not to call the pre_templatename and
	  validate_templatename subroutines if the non-OOP (function-based) approach using
	  the initialize_cgi_framework initializer was used, and the callbacks_namespace
	  parameter was not supplied.

0.04
	- Any methods and initializer parameters that were made up of 2 concatenated words
	  have now been separated by an underscore.  The following are affected:

	  Methods/Functions:
	  adderror		=>	add_error
	  clearsession	=> clear_session
	  showtemplate	=> show_template

	  Constructor/Initializer parameters:
	  callbacksnamespace	=>	callbacks_namespace
	  cookiename			=>	cookie_name
	  initialtemplate		=>	initial_template
	  sessionsdir			=>	sessions_dir
	  templatesdir			=>	templates_dir
	  validlanguages		=>	valid_languages

	  The old names will still be available for compatability-purposes however will be
	  phased out sometime in the future for code-cleanliness.  All existing and new
	  programs should use the new naming convention.

	- Implemented the ability to save session data in a mysql table instead of text files
	  through a new constructor parameter sessions_mysql_dbh.
	- Implemented a new method "remember" that is a shorthand for transferring values
	  from the just-submitted form to the session.
	- Changed default form enctype to "multipart/form-data" so that file-uploads can
	  be done.  This seems to have no side-effect other than enabling file uploads to
	  work.
	- Some documentation and synopsis bugfixes. - Thanks to Ron Savage <rons@deakin.edu.au>

	-  Added new constructor option, importform
	-  Documentation fixes and elaborations
