NAME
    Net::DNS::QueryID - random Query ID numbers

SYNOPSIS
    Functions to manage a cache of random Query ID's for DNS packets.

    The purpose of this module is to provide and unpredictable source of 16
    bit DNS Query ID numbers to help defeat cache poisoning using DNS
    Spoofing or "Man in the Middle" attacks as describe in the Wikipedia
    article and its references:

            http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_cache_poisoning

      use Net::DNS::QueryID qw(
            id_get
            id_clr
            id_busy
      );

      $queryID = id_get();
      $result  = id_clr($queryID);
      $result  = id_busy($queryID);

    * $queryID = id_get();
      input:        none
      returns:      16 bit integer from 1 - 65535
                    that is not currently in the cache.
                    false (0) if all 65535 ID's are in use

    * $result = id_clr($queryID);
      input:        Query ID to clear
      returns:      true (the Query ID) on success
                    false if the Query ID is not in use
                    false if the Query ID is out of range
                    i.e. not 1 -1 65535

    * $result = id_busy($queryID);
      input:        Query ID
      returns:      true if Query ID is in the cache
                    false if Query ID is not in the cache
                    false if Query ID is out of range
                    i.e. not 1 -165535
