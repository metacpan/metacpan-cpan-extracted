0.27 (2018/06/15)
    Added Test::Simple 1.302073 as minimum version required to be able to use

    Getting a logger from Log::Log4perl to be able to improve performance by
    avoiding doing expensive string
    concatenation unless the log level allows it.
    Reverted changes on list_reset() to go back reading and printing each line
