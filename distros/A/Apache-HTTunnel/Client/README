INSTALLATION

- To install this module type the following:

     % perl Makefile.PL
     % make
     % make test
     % make install

     Note 1: The test suite will require the URL to an Apache::HTTunnel server 
             to run. You will prompted for it during the installation. This 
             server must allow tunnels to localhost:80. That Apache server 
             must also return an HTTP 200 code for a "GET / HTTP/1.0" request. 
             Generally if the server has index.html file in the document root 
             it will be ok.
