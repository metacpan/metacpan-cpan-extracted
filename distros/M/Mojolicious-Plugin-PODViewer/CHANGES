    [Fixed]

    - Fixed routing when the plugin was not directly at the root. Thanks
      @iamb!
    - Fixed link rewriting to only rewrite modules in the allowed
      modules list. This prevents the need for a 302 Redirect for
      modules we aren't serving. Thanks @iamb!

    - Added option to change route to load POD under. Previously, it
      would only be available under `/perldoc`.
    - Added option to change the default module. Previously, it would
      load Mojolicious::Guides.
    - Added a custom template. The template being used previously was
      the one shipped with Mojolicious and designed for the
      mojolicious.org website (which is not appropriate for other
      sites).
    - Added a "layout" option. This is the easiest way to customize the
      appearance of the POD output (using CSS and surrounding content).
    - Added "allow_modules" option to restrict which modules are served
      from the app. Any disallowed modules will be redirected to
      MetaCPAN.
