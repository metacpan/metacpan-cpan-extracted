Building DBD::DB2
-----------------
1.  The DBD::DB2 driver is supported by DB2 UDB V8.2 and
    later. See http://www.software.ibm.com/data/db2/perl
    for more information on supported environments.
2.  The DB2 Application Development Client is required.
    You can download the client here:
    http://www.ibm.com/software/data/db2/udb/support/
3.  The build must be performed in a properly configured
    DB2 environment (ie. You have installed the DB2
    Application Development Client).  On Unix, make sure
    the shell has sourced the sqllib/db2profile OR the
    DB2_HOME environment variable must point to
    the installed location of DB2.  For example, if you
    installed DB2 to /home/inst1/sqllib then you would need
    to export DB2_HOME=/home/inst1/sqllib before building
    the DBD::DB2 driver.


Common Build Errors:
--------------------
When compiling the DBD::DB2 driver and you see errors such
as the following:

sqlcli.h: No such file or directory
sqlc1l1.h: No such file or directory
sqlext.h: No such file or directory

This usually means that you are not in a properly configured
DB2 client shell. A typical case would be that you installed
DB2 to /home/inst1/sqllib and now you are using root to install
DBD::DB2.  The root id does not have the DB2 Client configured.
The fix for this scenario is as follows:

export DB2_HOME=/home/inst1/sqllib
perl Makefile.PL     (This will create the proper INC)

Then check the Makefile created to verify that the INC is correct.
For example:

INC = -I"/home/inst1/sqllib/include" -I"/usr/lib/perl5/site_perl
/5.8.0/i386-linux-thread-multi/auto/DBI" -I"/usr/lib/perl5/vendor_
perl/5.8.0/i386-linux-thread-multi/auto/DBI"

The headers files are located under /home/inst1/sqllib/include.

Known Test Case issues:
-----------------------
1) perld020_stmtWithHostVars: Due to error code changes from version V95 to V97 of DB2 you will see this test case failing against V97. 
	This can be safely ignored as it does not impact any functionality.
2) perld071_connIncorrectPortRemote: This test case checks that a proper connection failure message is thrown when passed wrong port information.
	Given that the protocol specific codes is different on different platforms you might see this case failing on some platforms due to mismatch
	in the protocol code.
	
Special Notes re: Linux
-----------------------
Some versions of gcc have problems with optimization.  This
can cause Contants.C to take a long time to compile.  Please
be patient, it will probably finish eventually.  If it
doesn't, or the resulting build causes a 'Total
Environment allocation failure!' error when you try to
connect, you will have to edit the Makefile (after running
perl Makefile.PL) and change:

        OPTIMIZE = -O2
          to
        OPTIMIZE = -O0


If during the "make test" step, you get the following error:

"/auto/DBD/DB2/Constants/SQL_PARAM_I.al" cannot be located

you will need to remove some constants from Constants.pm or
Constants.C file. This file is located under the Constants
directory.  The Constants.pm is there to allow you to use
constants inside your perl script. You can remove all the
constants that you don't need.


Special Notes re: HP-UX
-----------------------
1.  At the present time, HP-UX V11 cannot dynamically load
    libraries that contain thread local storage.  As such,
    additional libraries, -lpthread and -lcl, MUST be
    specified when building perl.  If this is not done,
    errors will occur during the DBD::DB2 "make test" phase.
2.  In order to avoid some warnings when building perl, DBI,
    and DBD::DB2, you may want to add the compile option,
    +DAportable.  This compile option is used to generate
    code that is compatible across both PA_RISC 1.1 and 2.0
    workstations and servers.
3.  If an "out of memory" error is returned when compiling
    the file Constants.c during the DBD::DB2 build process,
    remove the "+Onolimit" compile option from the file
    Makefile.PL in the Constants subdirectory and restart
    the build process.  Removing this compile option will
    result in a warning like "Exceeding compiler resource
    limits in constants; some optimizations skipped", but
    this warning can be ignored.


Special Notes re: AIX 5.1
-------------------------
When using AIX v5.1.0.0 with DB2 v8.1.1.32 and Visual Age
Compiler v6.0.0.0, make returns the following error:

"dbdimp.c", line 1272.28: 1506-196 (E) Initialization between
types "const unsigned char*" and "char*" is not allowed.
"dbdimp.c", line 1273.27: 1506-196 (E) Initialization between
 types "const unsigned char*" and "char*" is not allowed.

The fix is to edit the Makefile and add "-qlanglvl=extended"
to the CCFLAGS entry


Special Notes re: Windows
-------------------------
When using MS Visual Studio 7 (cl compiler version 13.10.3077),
"nmake test" fails. This problem can be fixed by upgrading to
Service Pack 1 (cl compiler version 13.10.6030). With this version,
if you continue with the install, the programs run fine.


Special Notes re: Binding the CLI packages
------------------------------------------
The DBD::DB2 uses CLI to access the server. The DB2 CLI
packages are automatically bound to the databases when the
databases are created or migrated.  If a FixPak is applied
to either the client or server, or a user has intentionally
dropped a package, then you must rebind db2cli.lst, by issuing
the following command:

On UNIX:
db2 connect to <dbAlias>
db2 bind <BNDPATH>/.lst blocking all grant public

On Windows:
db2 connect to <dbAlias>
db2 bind "%DB2PATH%\bnd\.lst" blocking all grant public

For z/OS (OS/390) server, use the ddcsmvs.lst bind list file.
For iSeries (AS/400) server, use the ddcs400.lst bind list file.
For VM/VSE, use ddcsvm.lst and ddcsvse.lst bind files.

For more information, please see the infocenter:

http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/db2help/index.jsp

Search for CLI bind files.


Special Notes re: Metadata functions
------------------------------------
Each of the perl metadata functions maps to a CLI equivalent.

     DBI method        CLI function
     ----------        -------------
     column_info       SQLColumns
     foreign_key_info  SQLForeignKeys
     get_info          SQLGetInfo
     primary_key_info  SQLPrimaryKeys
     table_info        SQLTables
     type_info         SQLGetTypeInfo

For more information on each of the CLI functions,
please see the infocenter:

http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/db2help/index.jsp

The above link contains information for DB2 UDB v8.
For v7 users, please consult the v7 CLI Guide And Reference.

The metadata functions require certain stored procedures to
be installed on the DB2 Server.  These stored procedures are
installed by default, but if you get errors calling these
methods, you may want to check that your DB2 server has the
following pre-requisites installed:

DB2 for z/OS (OS/390):
APAR 76858

DB2 for iSeries (OS/400):
5722SS1 SI05363 is the PTF to refer to for v5r1 enablement

DB2 for VM/VSE:
Schema function stored procedures are available for download from the
DB2 Server for VM/VSE web page:
http://www-306.ibm.com/software/data/db2/vse-vm/support/dwnldsfs.html


Special Notes re: type_info
---------------------------
To retrieve the type information for DATE, TIME or TIMESTAMP,
you must pass to $dbh->type_info one of the following constants:

SQL_TYPE_DATE
SQL_TYPE_TIME
SQL_TYPE_TIMESTAMP

For example:

use DBD::DB2::Constants;
@ra = $dbh->type_info( SQL_TYPE_DATE );


Unsupported Features
--------------------
1.  Fetching any type of LOB directly to a file.
2.  The child process of a fork cannot use the DB2 Perl driver
    whatsoever.  In addition the child process must turn on the
    InactiveDestroy flag for any DBI handles inherited.
3.  Local row caching: $dbh->{RowCacheSize} and $sth->{RowsInCache}
