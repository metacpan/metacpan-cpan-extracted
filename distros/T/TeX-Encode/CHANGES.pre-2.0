Revision history for Perl extension Encode::LaTeX.

2.0
    - New co-maintainer, added repository link
    - Added 295 new mappings (PAUSE issue #118001)

1.3
	- Oops, missing BibTeX.pm and charmap.pm from MANIFEST

1.2
	- Added support to encode() for check argument
	- Adds braces to protect whitespace after macros
	- This version is a clean-up version that doesn't emit HTML fragments, if
	  you want HTML you should look at http://www.mathjax.org/

1.1
	- Added support for \ensuremath{}
	- Wrap greek letters in \ensuremath{} to fix a typesetting problem
	  (reported by Mark Muldoon)

1.0
	- CPAN thinks 0.10 is less than 0.9

0.10
	- Remove empty braces e.g. $\sim{}200$

0.9
	- Removed autoloader: this isn't an xs module
	- Added LaTeX 'special characters'
	- Changed decode behaviour to decode mathmode first, then other macros
	- Modified decode to use a single regexp for other macros
	- Searches for longest named macro first

0.7
	- Fixed bug: Wasn't actually eating paired braces at all
	- math** and text** now map to span classes of the same name in htmlise
	- Added encoding of TeX reserved characters

0.6
	- Fixed incompatibility with HTML::Parser 1.35
	- Upped the required versions of Pod::LaTeX and HTML::Entities to ones I know
		work

0.5
	- Fixed an incorrect quoting bug in MathMode
	- Added a couple of tests for quote bug and escaping
	- Now unescapes any singular character (\\ => \, \x => x, etc), this may be
		too broad and need casing?

0.4
	- Support for Latex braces (e.g. {\rm \sigma})
	- Support for fractions (still off-set though)

0.3
	- Moved namespace to TeX::Encode, as this isn't really
	character encoding per-se (more character escaping)

0.2
	- Added support for decoding mathematical symbols

0.1  Tue Aug 16 12:58:54 2005
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.23 with options
		-X -v 0.1 -b 5.8.0 -n Encode::LaTeX
