This module, built as a subclass of XML::Parser, parses encoding map
XML files. Included in the distribution is the compile_encoding script
that compiles these to the binary form used by XML::Parser in order to
parse scripts in the given encoding. Also included is a script that
generates encoding map XML files from the type of mapping files obtained
at ftp://ftp.unicode.org/Public/MAPPINGS.

Several encoding maps are included in the maps subdirectory.

There is nothing to build, but to test and install you need to do the
following:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make test
	make install
