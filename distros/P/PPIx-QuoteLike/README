PPIx-QuoteLike is Copyright (C) 2016 by Thomas R. Wyant, III

DESCRIPTION

This Perl module parses Perl-syntax quote-like strings in a manner more
or less consistent with PPI.

The PPIx::QuoteLike object is instantiated using new(), passing either
one of the relevant PPI objects or a string representation.

See the eg/ directory for samples.

INSTALLATION

This module is best installed using your favorite CPAN client: cpan,
cpanp, or cpanm. ActivePerl users can try their ppm.

Failing that, you can use one of the two usual incantations:

    gunzip PPIx-QuoteLike-9.999.tar.gz
    tar -xf PPIx-QuoteLike-9.999.tar
    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

or

    gunzip PPIx-QuoteLike-9.999.tar.gz
    tar -xf PPIx-QuoteLike-9.999.tar
    perl Build.PL
    ./Build
    ./Build test
    ./Build install

You should substitute the appropriate program name for 'make', eg nmake
(typically) under MSWin32, or mms or mmk under VMS. See
ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/Softlib/MSLFILES/nmake15.exe for a copy of
nmake for MSWin32 if you need it.

Of course, since it's pure Perl, you can just expand the kit and drop
SpaceTrack.pm and the SpaceTrack folder into the Astro directory
(creating it if necessary) in the appropriate place in your @INC
directories.
