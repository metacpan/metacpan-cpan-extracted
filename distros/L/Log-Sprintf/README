SYNOPSIS

     my $log_formatter = Log::Sprintf->new({
       category => 'DeployMethod',
       format   => '[%L][%p][%c] %m',
     });
    
     $log_formatter->sprintf({
       line     => 123,
       package  => 'foo',
       priority => 'trace',
       message  => 'starting connect',
     });

    Or to add or override flags, make a subclass and use it instead:

     package SuprLogr;
     use base 'Log::Sprintf';
    
     sub codes {
       return {
         c => 'coxyx',
         x => 'xylophone',
       }
     }
    
     sub coxyx { 'COXYX' }
    
     sub xylophone { 'doink' }

    and elsewhere...

     my $log_formatter = SuprLogr->new({ format => '[%c][%x] %m' });
    
     $log_formatter->sprintf({ message => 'GOGOGO' });

DESCRIPTION

    This module is meant as a mostly drop in replacement for the log
    formatting system that Log::log4perl uses; it doesn't bring in all of
    the weight of Log::log4perl and allows you to add new flags in
    subclasses.

DIFFERENCES FROM LOG4PERL

    Instead of %p{1} for a single character priority, this uses %{1}p.
    Similarly, instead of %m{chomp} for a message with a trailing newline
    removed, this uses %{chomp}m.

METHODS

 new

     my $log_formatter = Log::Sprintf->new({
       category     => 'WebServer',
       format       => '[%L][%C] %m',
       priority     => 'trace',
     })

    returns a freshly instantiated Log::Sprintf object. Currently it has
    the following options, none of which are required.

  arguments

      * format - the format to use for logging. See "formats" for what's
      available.

      * category - what category we are logging to

      * priority - the priority or level we are logging to (trace, debug,
      etc)

      * package - the package you are logging from

      * date - the date the log happened

      * file - the file you are logging from

      * host - the host you are logging from

      * line - the line you are logging from

      * subroutine - the subroutine you are logging from

      * pid - the pid you are logging from

      * priority - the priority (level) you are logging at

      * milliseconds_since_start - milliseconds since program start

      * milliseconds_since_last_log - milliseconds since previous log

      * stacktrace - full stacktrace

  formats

      * C - "package"

      * c - "category"

      * d - "date", in the format of localtime or gmtime

      * F - "file"

      * H - "host"

      * L - "line"

      * l - "location"

      * M - "subroutine"

      * m - "message"

      * {chomp}m - "message", but with any trailing newline removed

      * n - "newline"

      * P - "pid"

      * p - "priority"

      * {1}p - "priority", but just the first character

      * r - "milliseconds_since_start"

      * R - "milliseconds_since_last_log"

      * T - "stacktrace", an arrayref of arrayrefs in the format of
      caller($x), ordered by deeper to shallower in the trace

 sprintf

    Takes the exact same arguments as "new" with the additional message
    argument. Returns a formatted string. Note that if a flag is included
    in your format but its corresponding value is not included in the call
    to sprintf you will get lots of warnings.

 format

    Returns the current format

SUBCLASSING

    This module was designed from the start to be subclassed. All you need
    to know to subclass it (to add or change formatting codes) is that the
    codes subroutine should be defined in your subclass, and should return
    a hashref where keys are codes and values are the names of methods your
    class defines to fill in the values of those codes.

MESSAGE METHODS

 milliseconds_since_start

    returns milliseconds since instantiation

 milliseconds_since_last_log

    returns milliseconds since last log

 line

    returns line

 file

    returns file

 package

    returns package

 subroutine

    returns subroutine

 category

    returns category

 message

    returns message; if passed "chomp" it will remove a trailing newline
    from message

 priority

    returns priority; if passed a true value it will only return the first
    character

 date_str

    returns date formatted as YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS

 host

    returns host

 location

    returns location (as in "$subroutine $file:$line")

 newline

    returns newline

 pid

    returns process id

SEE ALSO

    Log::Log4perl

      this module has a lot of really neat ideas

    Log::Structured

    you can use this module to fill in the values for "sprintf"
