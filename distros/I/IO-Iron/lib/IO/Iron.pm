=head1 DESCRIPTION

IronCache, IronMQ and IronWorker are cloud based services accessible 
via a REST API. CPAN Distribution IO::Iron contains Perl clients for 
accessing them.

[See L<http://www.iron.io/|http://www.iron.io/>]

Please see the individual clients for further documentation and usage.

Clients:

=over 8

=item L<IO::Iron::IronCache::Client|IO::Iron::IronCache::Client>

=item L<IO::Iron::IronMQ::Client|IO::Iron::IronMQ::Client>

=item L<IO::Iron::IronWorker::Client|IO::Iron::IronWorker::Client>

=back

IO-Iron code is available at Github: L<IO-Iron|https://github.com/mikkoi/io-iron>
for download with Git: L<https://github.com/mikkoi/io-iron.git|https://github.com/mikkoi/io-iron.git>.

=head2 IO::Iron

Package IO::Iron is only a "convenience" module for quick startup.
The three functions provided are L<ironcache|/#ironcache>, 
L<ironmq|/#ironmq> and L<ironworker|/#ironworker>.

The following parameters can be given to each of them as hash item type
parameters. See section L<SYNOPSIS|/#SYNOPSIS> for an example.

=over 8

=item C<project_id>,        The ID of the project to use for requests.

=item C<token>,             The OAuth token that is used to authenticate requests.

=item C<host>,              The domain name the API can be located at. E.g. 'mq-aws-us-east-1.iron.io/1'.

=item C<protocol>,          The protocol that will be used to communicate with the API. Defaults to "https".

=item C<port>,              The port to connect to the API through. Defaults to 443.

=item C<api_version>,       The version of the API to connect through. Defaults to the version supported by the client.

=item C<timeout>,           REST client timeout (for REST calls accessing IronMQ.)

=item C<config>,            Config filename with path if required.

=back

You can also give the parameters in the config file F<.iron.json> or 
F<iron.json> (in local directory) or as environmental variables. Please read 
L<Configuring the Official Client Libraries|http://dev.iron.io/mq/reference/configuration/> for further details.

=head3 Client Documentation

Please read individual client's documentation for using them.

=head3 Exceptions

A REST call to Iron service may fail for several reason.
All failures generate an exception using the L<Exception::Class|Exception::Class> package.
Class IronHTTPCallException contains the field status_code, response_message and error.
Error is formatted as such: IronHTTPCallException: status_code=<HTTP status code> response_message=<response_message>.

    use Try::Tiny;
    use Scalar::Util qw{blessed};
    try {
        my $asked_iron_cache_01 = $iron_cache_client->get_cache('name' => 'unique_cache_name_01');
    }
    catch {
        die $_ unless blessed $_ && $_->can('rethrow');
        if ( $_->isa('IronHTTPCallException') ) {
            if ($_->status_code == 404) {
                print "Bad things! Can not just find the catch in this!\n";
            }
        }
        else {
            $_->rethrow; # Push the error upwards.
        }
    };

When using policies (see next chapter) also exceptions
NoIronPolicyException and CharacterGroupNotDefinedIronPolicyException
can be met.

=head3 Policies

Policies is a way to limit the names of message queues, code packages,
caches and items (item keys)
to a predefined group of possible strings. This can limit the chances
for typos and enforce an enterprise policy. The policies are loaded from
a JSON file which is specified either when creating a 
IO::Iron::Iron*::Client object, or 
in the config file F<.iron.json> (or equivalent).

=head4 Policies in Config file

Add the item I<policies> to the config file. The value of the item is the 
filename of the policies file.

Example config file:

    {
        "project_id":"51bdf5fb2267d84ced002c99",
        "token":"-Q9OEHZPhdZtd0KHBzzdUJIqV_E",
        "host":"cache-aws-us-east-1.iron.io",
        "policies":"iron_policies.json"
    }

=head4 Policies file specified when creating the client

    my $policies_filename = '/etc/ironmq/global_policies.json';
    my $client = IO::Iron::IronCache::Client->new('policies' => $policies_filename);

=head4 Examples of Policies File and Explanation of Configuration

The 'default' policies JSON file:

    {
    "definition":{
        "character_group":{
        },
        "no_limitation":1, # There is an unlimited number of alternatives.
    },
    "queue":{ "name":[ "[:alnum:]{1,}" ], },
    "cache":{
        "name":[ "[:alnum:]{1,}" ],
        "item_key":[ "[:alnum:]{1,}" ]
        },
    "worker":{ "name":[ "[:alnum:]{1,}" ], }
    }

The above file would set an open policy for IronMQ, IronCache and IronWorker alike.
The file is divided into four parts: definition for defining meta options, and
queue|cache|worker parts for defining the changing strings
(queue|cache|worker names and item keys). The character group I<alnum> covers
all ascii alphabetic characters (both lower and upper case) and digits (0-9).

N.B. The option I<definition:no_limitation> controls the open/closed policy.
If I<definition:no_limitation> is set (1=set), the policy control is
turned off.

An example of policies file 

    {
        "__comment1":"Use normal regexp. [:digit:] = number:0-9, [:alpha:] = alphabetic character, [:alnum:] = character or number.",
        "__comment2":"Do not use end/begin limitators '^' and '\$'. They are added automatically.",
        "__comment3":"Note that character groups are closed inside '[::]', not '[[:]]' as normal POSIX groups.",
        "definition":{
            "character_group":{
                "[:lim_uchar:]":"ABC",
                "[:low_digit:]":"0123"
            },
        },
        "cache":{
            "name":[
                "cache_01_main",
                "cache_[:alpha:]{1}[:digit:]{2}"
            ],
            "item_key":[
                "item.01_[:digit:]{2}",
                "item.02_[:lim_uchar:]{1,2}"
            ]
        }
    }

This policies file sets policies for cache names and item keys. Both have two
templates. Template "cache_01_main" is without wildcards: the template list
can also only contain predefined names or keys. Sometimes this could be
exactly the wanted behaviour, especially in regard to cache and 
message queue names.

Items beginning with '__' are considered comments. Comments can not be
inserted into lists, such as I<character_group>.

The I<definition> part contains the list I<character_group> for user-defined
groups. The following groups are predefined:

=over 8

=item [:alpha:], ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz

=item [:alnum:], ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789

=item [:digit:], 0123456789

=item [:lower:], abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz

=item [:upper:], ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ

=item [:word:], ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789_

=back

All lower ASCII (7-bit) characters are allowed in names and in character
groups, except for the reserved characters (S<RFC 3986>)
S<B<!$&'()*+,;=:/?#[]@>>.

A character group definition is closed inside characters '[::]',
not '[[:]]' as normal POSIX groups. Only the equivalents of the POSIX groups
mentioned above can be used; e.g. POSIX group C<[[:graph:]]> is not available.

When using the character groups in a name or key, only two markings are allowed:
C<[:group:]{n}> and C<[:group:]{n,n}>, where C<n> is an integer.
This limitation (not being able to use any regular expression) is due to the
double functionality of the policy: a) it acts as a filter when creating
and naming new message queues, code packages, caches and cache items; 2) it
can be used to list all possible names, for example when querying for
cache items.

=head1 TESTING

Subdirectory F<integ_t> contains "integration" tests which require an active Iron.io account and Internet connection.
To run the tests, create first three config files in the main directory: 
F<iron_cache.json>, F<iron_mq.json>, F<iron_worker.json>.
Set at least the following attributes: B<project_id>, B<token> and B<host>.

Execute B<prove> (L<prove|https://metacpan.org/pod/distribution/TAP-Parser/bin/prove>), e.g. B<prove -lv -Iinteg_t integ_t\Iron\iron_all.t>.

=item * Fix the $self->{'caches'} to a hash instead of list.

=item * Implement new features in http://blog.iron.io/2014/05/ironmq-long-polling.html

=over 4

=item - Long Polling

=item - Get-Delete as One Operation

=back

=item * The IronMQ client needs to control the queues, perhaps using semafores.

=item * A buffer mechanism to keep the messages while the IronMQ REST service is unavailable. IO::Iron::IronMQ::ASyncPush?

=item * Implement push queues.

=item * Mock IronMQ/IronCache for testing.

=item * Handle message size (total), delay, timeout and expiration min-max values.

=over 4

=item * Message Var	Default	Maximum	Notes

=item * Message Size	--	64KB	Includes the entire request (delay, timeout, expiration).

=item * Delay	0sec	604,800sec	Message is made available on queue after the delay expires.

=item * Timeout	60sec	86,400sec	Message goes back on queue after timeout unless deleted.

=item * Expiration	604,800sec	2,592,000sec	Equates to 7 days and 30 days, respectively.

=item * Messages per Get	1	100	One or more messages can be handled at a time.

=back

=item * Option to delete queue when IO::Iron::IronMQ::Queue object goes to garbage collection?

=item * Verify the client is connected when created (by calling queues?)

=item * Rethink the using of REST:Client. Since message queues often involve a lot of traffic 
but always to the same address, we need to optimize REST:Client usage.

=item * Carp::Assert, Carp::Assert::More, other checking deactivation in production?
