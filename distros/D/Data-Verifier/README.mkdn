# NAME

Data::Verifier - Profile based data verification with Moose type constraints.

# VERSION

version 0.61

# DESCRIPTION

Data::Verifier allows you verify data (such as web forms, which was the
original idea) by leveraging the power of Moose's type constraint system.

# MOTIVATION

Data::Verifier firstly intends to leverage Moose's type constraint system,
which is significantly more powerful than anything I could create for the
purposes of this module.  Secondly it aims to keep a fairly simple interface
by leveraging the aforementioned type system to keep options to a minimum.

# NOTES

## Multiple Values

It should be noted that if you choose to make a param a `Str` then validation
will fail if multiple values are provided.  To allow multiple values you
must use an `ArrayRef[Str]`.

## ArrayRef based types (more on Multiple Values)

If you use an ArrayRef-based parameterized type (e.g. ArrayRef\[Str\]) then
Data::Verifier has the following behavior:

Each parameter supplied for the field is checked.  If all the members pass
then the field is considered valid.  If any of the members fail, then the
entire field is invalid.  If any of the members pass then those members will
be included in the `values` attribute.  An example:

    use Moose::Util::TypeConstraints;
    use Data::Verifier;

    subtype 'Over10'
    => as 'Num'
    => where { $_ > 10 };

    my $verifier = Data::Verifier->new(
    profile => {
        foos => {
            type => 'ArrayRef[NumberOver10]',
        }
    }
    );

    my $res = $verifier->verify(foos => [ 1, 2, 30, 40 ]);
    $res->success; # This is false, as 1 and 2 did not pass
    $res->get_value('foos'); # [ 30, 40 ] because 30 and 40 passed!
    $res->original_value('foos); # [ 1, 2, 30, 40 ] because it's all of them!

It should also be noted that `post_check`s that are specified in the profile
do **not** get applied to the individual members, only to the entire, completed
field that they are constituents of.

**Note**: Filters and such DO get applied to individual fields, so something
like:

    my $verifier = Data::Verifier->new(
      filters => qw(trim),
      profile => {
          foos => {
              type => 'ArrayRef[Str]',
              filters => 'collapse'
          }
      }
    );

In the above example, both `trim` and `collapse` **bill** be applied to each
member of foos.

## Stops on First Failure

Data::Verifier stops checking a field (not all, just the failed one) if it
fails any of it's constraints. Consult the Execution Order below to ascertain
the order.  For example, if a field exceeds it's max length then it will not
be checked against it's type constraint.

## Serialization

Data::Verifier uses [MooseX::Storage](https://metacpan.org/pod/MooseX::Storage) to allow serialization of
[Data::Verifier::Results](https://metacpan.org/pod/Data::Verifier::Results) objects.  You can use this to store results for
validation across redirects.  Note, however, that the `value`
attribute is **not** serialized.  Since you can coerce a value into anything
it is not reasonable to expect to be able to serialize it.  Have a look at
the `original_value` or `post_filter_value` in [Data::Verifier::Results](https://metacpan.org/pod/Data::Verifier::Results)
if you want to know more.

## Verifying Objects

Data::Verifier can verify data encapsulated in objects too. Everything works
the way that it does for hash references.  Each key in the profile is used as
the name of a method to call on the object. In order to maintain consistency
with the hash reference case, missing methods pass an 'undef' value into the
verification process.

## Execution Order

It may be important to understand the order in which the various steps of
verification are performed:

- Global Filters

    Any global filters in the profile are executed.

- Per-Field Filters

    Any per-field filters are executed.

- Empty String Check

    If the value of the field is an empty string then it is changed to an undef.

- Required Check

    The parameter must now be defined if it is set as required.

- Length Check

    Minimum then maximum length is checked.

- Type Check (w/Coercion)

    At this point the type will be checked after an optional coercion.

- Dependency Checks

    If this field has dependents then those will now be processed.

- Post Check

    If the field has a post check it will now be executed.

- Derived Fields

    Finally any derived fields are run.

# SYNOPSIS

    use Data::Verifier;

    my $dv = Data::Verifier->new(
        filters => [ qw(trim) ],
        profile => {
            name => {
                required    => 1,
                type        => 'Str',
               filters     => [ qw(collapse) ]
            },
            age  => {
                type        => 'Int'
            },
            sign => {
                required    => 1,
                type        => 'Str'
            }
        }
    );

    # Pass in a hash of data
    my $results = $dv->verify({
        name => 'Cory', age => 'foobar'
    });

    $results->success; # no

    $results->is_invalid('name'); # no
    $results->is_invalid('age');  # yes

    $results->is_missing('name'); # no
    $results->is_missing('sign'); # yes

    $results->get_original_value('name'); # Unchanged, original value
    $results->get_value('name'); # Filtered, valid value
    $results->get_value('age');  # undefined, as it's invalid

# ATTRIBUTES

## derived

An optional hashref of fields that will be derived from inspecting one or more
fields in the profile.

The keys for `derived` are as follows:

- **required**

    Marks this derived field as required.  If the `deriver` returns undef then
    when this is true then the field, any source `fields` and (in turn) the entire
    profile will be invalid.

- **fields**

    An optional arrayref that contains the names of any "source" fields that
    should be considered invalid if this field is determiend to be invalid.

- **deriver**

    A subref that is passed a copy of the final results for the profile.  The
    return value of this subref will be used as the value for the field. A return
    value of undef will cause the field (and any source fields) to be makred
    invalid **if** required is true.

An example:

    my $verifier = Data::Verifier->new(
        profile => {
            first_name => {
                required => 1
            },
            last_name => {
                required => 1
            }
        },
        derived => {
            'full_name' => {
                required => 1,
                fields => [qw(first_name last_name)],
                deriver => sub {
                    my $r = shift;
                    return $r->get_value('first_name').' '.$r->get_value('last_name')
                }
            }
        }
    );

In the above example a field named `full_name` will be created that is
the other two fields concatenated.  If the derived field is required and
`deriver` subref returns undef then the derived field **and** the fields
listed in `fields` will also be invalid.

## filters

An optional arrayref of filter names through which **all** values will be
passed.

## profile

The profile is a hashref.  Each value you'd like to verify is a key.  The
values specify all the options to use with the field.  The available options
are:

- **coerce**

    If true then the value will be given an opportunity to coerce via Moose's
    type system.  If this is set, coercion will be ignored.

- **coercion**

    Set this attribute to the coercion defined for this type.  If **coerce** is
    set this attribute will be ignored.  See the `coercion` method above.

- **dependent**

    Allows a set of fields to be specifid as dependents of this one.  The argument
    for this key is a full-fledged profile as you would give to the profile key:

        my $verifier = Data::Verifier->new(
            profile => {
                password    => {
                    dependent => {
                        password2 => {
                            required => 1,
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        );

    In the above example `password` is not required.  If it is provided then
    password2 must also be provided.  If any depedents of a field are missing or
    invalid then that field is **invalid**.  In our example if password is provided
    and password2 is missing then password will be invalid.

- **filters**

    An optional list of filters through which this specific value will be run.
    See the documentation for [Data::Verifier::Filters](https://metacpan.org/pod/Data::Verifier::Filters) to learn more.  This
    value my be either a scalar (string or coderef) or an arrayref of strings or
    coderefs.

- **max\_length**

    An optional length which the value may not exceed.

- **min\_length**

    An optional length which the value may not be less.

- **member\_post\_check**

    A post check that is only to be applied to the members of an ArrayRef based
    type.  Because it is verified in something of a vacuum, the results object it
    receives will have no other values to look at.  Therefore member\_post\_check
    is only useful if you want to do some sort of weird post-check thing that I
    can't imagine would be a good idea.

- **post\_check**

    The `post_check` key takes a subref and, after all verification has finished,
    executes the subref with the results of the verification as it's only argument.
    The subref's return value determines if the field to which the post\_check
    belongs is invalid.  A typical example would be when the value of one field
    must be equal to the other, like an email confirmation:

        my $verifier = Data::Verifier->new(
            profile => {
                email    => {
                    required => 1,
                    dependent => {
                        email2 => {
                            required => 1,
                        }
                    },
                    post_check => sub {
                        my $r = shift;
                        return $r->get_value('email') eq $r->get_value('email2');
                    }
                },
            }
        );

        my $results = $verifier->verify({
            email => 'foo@example.com', email2 => 'foo2@example.com'
        });

        $results->success; # false
        $results->is_valid('email'); # false
        $results->is_valid('email2'); # true, as it has no post_check

    In the above example, `success` will return false, because the value of
    `email` does not match the value of `email2`.  `is_valid` will return false
    for `email` but true for `email2`, since nothing specifically invalidated it.
    In this example you should rely on the `email` field, as `email2` carries no
    significance but to confirm `email`.

    **Note about post\_check and exceptions**: If have a more complex post\_check
    that could fail in multiple ways, you can `die` in your post\_check coderef
    and the exception will be stored in the fields `reason` attribute.

    **Note about post\_check and ArrayRef based types**: The post check is **not**
    executed for ArrayRef based types.  See the note earlier in this documentation
    about ArrayRefs.

- **required**

    Determines if this field is required for verification.

- **type**

    The name of the Moose type constraint to use with verifying this field's
    value. Note, this will also accept an instance of
    [Moose::Meta::TypeConstraint](https://metacpan.org/pod/Moose::Meta::TypeConstraint), although it may not serialize properly as a
    result.

# METHODS

## coercion

Define a coercion to use for verification.  This will not define a global
Moose type coercion, but is instead just a single coercion to apply to a
specific entity.

    my $verifier = Data::Verifier->new(
        profile => {
            a_string => {
                type     => 'Str',
                coercion => Data::Verifier::coercion(
                    from => 'Int',
                        via => sub { (qw[ one two three ])[ ($_ - 1) ] }
                ),
            },
        }
    );

## verify (\\%parameters)

Call this method and provide the parameters you are checking.  The results
will be provided to you as a [Data::Verifier::Results](https://metacpan.org/pod/Data::Verifier::Results) object.
