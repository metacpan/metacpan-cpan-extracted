    Test::SVN::Repo - Subversion repository fixtures for testing

VERSION

    version 0.022

SYNOPSIS

        # Create a plain on-disk repo
        my $repo = Test::SVN::Repo->new;
    
        # Create a repo with password authenticated server
        $repo = Test::SVN::Repo->new(
                users => { joe => 'secret', fred => 'foobar' },
            );
    
        my $repo_url = $repo->url;
    
        # do stuff with your new repo
        system("svn co --username joe --password secret $repo_url");

DESCRIPTION

    Create temporary subversion repositories for testing.

    If no authentication is required, a simple on-disk repo is created. An
    svnserve instance is created when authentication is required.

    Repositories and servers are cleaned up when the object is destroyed.

    Requires the svnadmin and svnserve external binaries. These are both
    included in standard Subversion releases.

METHODS

 CONSTRUCTOR

    Creates a new svn repository, spawning an svnserve server if
    authentication is required.

    Arguments. All are optional.

    users

      Hashref containing username/password pairs for repository
      authentication.

      If this attribute is specified, there must be at least one user.
      Specifying users causes an svnserve instance to be created.

    root_path

      Base path to create the repo. By default, a temporary directory is
      created, and deleted on exit.

    keep_files

      Prevent root_path from being deleted in the destructor.

      If root_path is provided in the constructor, it will be preserved by
      default. If no root_path is provided, and a temporary directory is
      created, it will be destroyed by default.

    verbose

      Verbose output. Default off.

    start_port end_port retry_count

      Server mode only.

      In order to find a free port for the server, ports are randomly
      selected from the range [start_port, end_port] until one succeeds.
      Gives up after retry_count failures.

      Default values: 1024, 65536, 1000

 READ-ONLY ACCESSORS

  url

    Repository URL.

  repo_path

    Local path to the SVN repository.

  is_authenticated

    True if the the svn repo requires authorisation. This is enabled by
    supplying a users hashref to the constructor.

  server_pid

    Process id of the svnserve process.

  server_port

    Listen port of the svnserve process.
