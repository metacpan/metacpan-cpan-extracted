INSTALL for Geo::KML::PolyMap v 1.34

2007-09-19


-----
1. Prerequisites
-----

This modules requires Carp, GD (>=2.0), Archive::Zip, File::Temp, and
Statistics::Descriptive. You could, technically, get away without the last one,
as it supports code that is not enabled in the default configuration. To do
this, you may have to delete code, however.

You should have at least one TrueType font installed on your system in order to
make maps with legends.

-----
2. Installation procedure
-----

Installation is mostly routine - run perl Makefile.PL, then make, and make install.

There is one post-installation step you must complete if you wish to generate
KMZ files with built-in legends. The variable $FONT_PATH, in PolyMap.pm, must
be changed to the pathname of a TrueType font that you would like to use to
render the legends. I realize this is suboptimal; it will probably change in a
later version.

If you do not have any TrueType font files lying around, you can try grabbing
the GPL'ed freefont package:
	 http://download.savannah.gnu.org/releases/freefont/

The FreeSans font in there should work well.

The perldoc says there is another configurable parameter - binning algorithm.
This is true, but it's set up such that you shouldn't need to change it out of
the box; if you're curious, read the perldoc to understand the advantages and
disadvantages of the different options.
