# ABSTRACT: Visualize stages in a process using area-encoded trapezoids. This trace can be used to show data in a part-to-whole representation similar to a "pie" trace, wherein each item appears in a single stage. See also the "funnel" trace type for a different approach to visualizing funnel data.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 TO_JSON

Serialize the trace to JSON. This method should be called only by L<JSON> serializer.

=head2 type

Trace type.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=over

=item * aspectratio

Sets the ratio between height and width

=item * baseratio

Sets the ratio between bottom length and maximum top length.

=item * customdata

Assigns extra data each datum. This may be useful when listening to hover, click and selection events. Note that, *scatter* traces also appends customdata items in the markers DOM elements

=item * customdatasrc

Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  customdata .

=item * dlabel

Sets the label step. See `label0` for more info.

=item * domain

=item * hoverinfo

Determines which trace information appear on hover. If `none` or `skip` are set, no information is displayed upon hovering. But, if `none` is set, click and hover events are still fired.

=item * hoverinfosrc

Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  hoverinfo .

=item * hoverlabel

=item * hovertemplate

Template string used for rendering the information that appear on hover box. Note that this will override `hoverinfo`. Variables are inserted using %{variable}, for example "y: %{y}". Numbers are formatted using d3-format's syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for example "Price: %{y:$.2f}". See https://github.com/d3/d3-format/blob/master/README.md#locale_format for details on the formatting syntax. The variables available in `hovertemplate` are the ones emitted as event data described at this link https://plot.ly/javascript/plotlyjs-events/#event-data. Additionally, every attributes that can be specified per-point (the ones that are `arrayOk: true`) are available. variables `label`, `color`, `value`, `percent` and `text`. Anything contained in tag `<extra>` is displayed in the secondary box, for example "<extra>{fullData.name}</extra>". To hide the secondary box completely, use an empty tag `<extra></extra>`.

=item * hovertemplatesrc

Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  hovertemplate .

=item * hovertext

Sets hover text elements associated with each sector. If a single string, the same string appears for all data points. If an array of string, the items are mapped in order of this trace's sectors. To be seen, trace `hoverinfo` must contain a *text* flag.

=item * hovertextsrc

Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  hovertext .

=item * ids

Assigns id labels to each datum. These ids for object constancy of data points during animation. Should be an array of strings, not numbers or any other type.

=item * idssrc

Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  ids .

=item * insidetextfont

=item * label0

Alternate to `labels`. Builds a numeric set of labels. Use with `dlabel` where `label0` is the starting label and `dlabel` the step.

=item * labels

Sets the sector labels. If `labels` entries are duplicated, we sum associated `values` or simply count occurrences if `values` is not provided. For other array attributes (including color) we use the first non-empty entry among all occurrences of the label.

=item * labelssrc

Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  labels .

=item * legendgroup

Sets the legend group for this trace. Traces part of the same legend group hide/show at the same time when toggling legend items.

=item * marker

=item * pmeta

Assigns extra meta information associated with this trace that can be used in various text attributes. Attributes such as trace `name`, graph, axis and colorbar `title.text`, annotation `text` `rangeselector`, `updatemenues` and `sliders` `label` text all support `meta`. To access the trace `meta` values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use `%{meta[i]}` where `i` is the index or key of the `meta` item in question. To access trace `meta` in layout attributes, use `%{data[n[.meta[i]}` where `i` is the index or key of the `meta` and `n` is the trace index.

=item * metasrc

Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  meta .

=item * name

Sets the trace name. The trace name appear as the legend item and on hover.

=item * opacity

Sets the opacity of the trace.

=item * scalegroup

If there are multiple funnelareas that should be sized according to their totals, link them by providing a non-empty group id here shared by every trace in the same group.

=item * showlegend

Determines whether or not an item corresponding to this trace is shown in the legend.

=item * stream

=item * text

Sets text elements associated with each sector. If trace `textinfo` contains a *text* flag, these elements will be seen on the chart. If trace `hoverinfo` contains a *text* flag and *hovertext* is not set, these elements will be seen in the hover labels.

=item * textfont

=item * textinfo

Determines which trace information appear on the graph.

=item * textposition

Specifies the location of the `textinfo`.

=item * textpositionsrc

Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  textposition .

=item * textsrc

Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  text .

=item * title

=item * transforms

=item * uid

Assign an id to this trace, Use this to provide object constancy between traces during animations and transitions.

=item * uirevision

Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name` and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`. Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`, `selectedpoints` is controlled by `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)` (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove traces before the end of the `data` array, such that the same trace has a different index, you can still preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a `uid` that stays with it as it moves.

=item * values

Sets the values of the sectors. If omitted, we count occurrences of each label.

=item * valuessrc

Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  values .

=item * visible

Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If *legendonly*, the trace is not drawn, but can appear as a legend item (provided that the legend itself is visible).
