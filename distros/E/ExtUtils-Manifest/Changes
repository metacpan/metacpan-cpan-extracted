      * ExtUtils::Command, ExtUtils::Install, ExtUtils::Manifest,
        ExtUtils::Mkbootstrap, ExtUtils::Mksymlists and ExtUtils::Packlist
        are all now considered to be separate distributions.  To avoid a
        circular dependency, MakeMaker distributes its own versions but CPAN
        should not index them and they will not overwrite a newer, installed
        version.

  We accomplish this by moving the auxillaries into inc/ and then culling
  them out of $self->{PM} with an override.  This is not ideal as it requires
  too much poking at the internals.  The final approach will probably be a
  three stage with auxillaries in extra_libs/ moved to inc/ before
  WriteMakefile is run.

  init_dirscan() has been split into init_MANPODS, init_MAN1PODS, init_MAN3PODS
  and init_PM for better encapsulation and easier overriding.

  init_MAN*PODS now share the same POD scanning code.

  Added an undocumented PMLIBPARENTDIRS flag to tell MakeMaker which
  directories should be treated as parent directories when determining
  what modules are below them.

 Remove the svn:keywords settings held over from CVS.  They weren't set right
 anyway.

 There are two files which need them.  MM_VMS and MakeMaker.pm both have
 a global $Revision variable.  That needs to be set.

     * META.yml will no longer be generated in the build directory.  It will
       only appear in the distdir.  This should make it easier on developers,
       they don't have to worry about checking the file in all the time.
     * Similarly, the SIGNATURE file will not be updated in the build
       directory.  It will only be generated in the distdir.

 In the course of doing this I've added the cd() method to unify handling
 of "cd into this directory and run this command" in the Makefile.  Needed
 it to make distdir do what I want and I wasn't going to add a bunch of
 duplicate distdir methods in MM_Win95 and MM_VMS.

 There's a lot of duplication yet to be eliminated using this new method.
