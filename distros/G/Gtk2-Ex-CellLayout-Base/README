Gtk2::Ex::CellLayout::Base provides a basic set functions for use in
new data viewer widgets written in Perl and wanting to implement the
Gtk2::CellLayout interface.

This code started life in Gtk2::Ex::TickerView, and because a
renderers list in Gtk2::CellLayout style is pretty much the same in
every new viewer it's offered for general use.

A few subtleties of GtkCellLayout aren't particularly well documented
in the Gtk reference manual, so even if you decide you don't like this
code you might still see if you agree with some of the details of
packing order, attribute application, etc.

The prerequisites are Gtk2-Perl and my Glib-Ex-ObjectBits.  Gtk2-Perl
1.180 or higher is needed to implement GtkCellLayout as an actual
GInterface from Perl code.
