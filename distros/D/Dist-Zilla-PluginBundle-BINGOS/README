    version 0.20

SYNOPSIS

       # in dist.ini
       [@BINGOS]

DESCRIPTION

    This is a Dist::Zilla PluginBundle. It is roughly equivalent to the
    following dist.ini:

      [@Basic]
    
      [MetaJSON]
      [PodSyntaxTests]
      [PodCoverageTests]
    
      [PodWeaver]
      [PkgVersion]
      [GithubMeta]
    
      [ChangelogFromGit]
      file_name = Changes
      tag_regexp = ^(\\d+\\.\\d+)$
      max_age = 1825
    
      [ReadmeAnyFromPod]
      [Test::Compile]
    
      [Clean]

    This PluginBundle also supports PluginRemover, so dropping a plugin is
    as easy as this:

       [@BINGOS]
       -remove = PluginIDontWant

 METHODS

    configure
