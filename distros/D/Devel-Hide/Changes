Revision history for Perl extension Devel::Hide.

0.0009  Mon Jan 28 2013
        - avoid "defined @HIDDEN" which generates
          a warning since Perl 5.15.7 
          CPAN RT #74225

0.0008  Thu Nov 15 2007
        - no real code changes
        - make t/050child-processes.t less clever for
          Windows' sake: which choked with too long
          argument and exec()

0.0007  Mon Nov  5 2007
        - promoted: no longer a development release

0.0006_01
        - some POD fixes
        - new option -from:children makes the selected
          modules hidden from process children as well
          (thanks to David Cantrell)

0.0005  Wed May 30 2007
        - code reformatting with perltidy
        - now warns about already loaded modules
        - META.yml is auto-generated by Makefile.PL
        - a bit of refactoring to affect code readability
        - side effect: warnings are emitted at compile time
          and at every import call - a hopefully better timing
        - the package variable @HIDDEN does not change anymore

0.0004  Tue May 29 2007
        - slight implementation change preparing for the big time

0.0003  Wed Oct 4 2006
        - not a development version anymore
        - get rid of warning at "t/003user.t"
        - new test "t/098pod-coverage.t"

0.00_02 Sun Sep 25 2005
        - lifted the requirement on perl 5.8: now 5.6.1 will do 
          (because it may use File::Temp to fake bad modules)

0.00_01 Tue Sep 20 2005
        - first release to CPAN

0.00_00 Tue Sep 13 2005
        - absolute beginning
