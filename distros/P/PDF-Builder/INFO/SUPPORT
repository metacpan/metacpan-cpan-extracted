PDF::Builder is a fork (July, 2017) of the popular PDF::API2 Perl 
software for PDF creation and manipulation. 

Why does it start with version 3.004? The owner of PDF::API2 requested 
that the name of the fork be changed from API2 to something else to 
avoid confusion. The author of Builder had originally offered this
software as another version of API2, and had already jumped the version
from 2.xxx (API2) to 3.xxx (now Builder) and had made three releases
(served from the catskilltech.com website). Rather than reset to 1.000, 
it seemed cleaner just to continue with the 3.xxx version.

PDF::Builder source is hosted on GitHub
(https://github.com/PhilterPaper/Perl-PDF-Builder), with the Perl
installable module download offered on CPAN (PDF::Builder). Many users can
directly install using a CPAN-compatible installer (e.g., 'cpan' on Strawberry
Perl, or 'cpanm').

Please raise issues (bug reports, etc.) on GitHub, under the "issues" tab,
with label "bugs". Feature Requests should be labeled "enhancement". The 
maintainer will close (and tag as appropriate) resolved or rejected issues. 

General discussions not pertaining to a specific issue (bug) may be
conducted on GitHub "issues", labeled with the "general discussion" label.

Do NOT under ANY circumstances open a PR (Pull Request) to report a bug. It is 
a waste of both your and our time and effort. Open a regular ticket (issue), 
and attach a Perl (.pl) program illustrating the problem, if possible. If you
believe that you have a program patch, and offer to share it as a PR, we may
give the go-ahead. Unsolicited PRs may be closed without further action.
