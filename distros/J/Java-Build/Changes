Revision history for Perl extension Java::Build.

0.05  Mon Oct  6 12:48:04 CDT 2003
        - Changed Tasks::jar so it accepts an undef manifest.
        - Cleaned t/02javac.t to remove the old compile filed test
        - Removed Java::Build::JVM::_dump_errors in favor of inlining its
          action.
        - Adjusted documentation and error message relating to tools.jar.
          During installation, this jar must be in the classpath.  Otherwise
          the tests will not work.
        - Corrected bug in GenericBuild::GO which did not allow callers
          to request the first step in the targets list.  (I will write
          50 times on the chalkboard: 0 is false.)
        - Renamed build.script to build.driver in the demo.  This is on my
          list of politically correct name changes 'script' is pajorative.
        - Corrected Tasks::copy_file so that directories with spaces are
          properly quoted.

        - Corrected small problems with the demo build so it will actually
          run on other people's machines.  (It used to depend on absolute
          paths, I made them relative.)
        - Added Test::More to the PREREQ_PM list in Makefile.PL.
        - Cleaned GenericBuild test file.
        - Improved GenericBuild error when GO receives a target that isn't
          in its list.
        - Corrected GenericBuild so it doesn't die when the BUILD_SUCCESS
          file is initially missing.
        - Corrected GenericBuild so GO no longer does an extra step when
          user requests two targets, the later of which is currently
          in BUILD_SUCCESS.
        - Changed Tasks::read_prop_file so it uses a bare return if it
          can't read the file.  It used to kill the program.  That lead
          to odd log entries when Tasks::update_prop_file was asked to
          update an absent file.
        - Made it a fatal error to supply a BASE_DIR argument to
          Tasks::build_file_list which is not an existing directory.
        - Added optional INCLUDE_PATTERNS parameter to
          Tasks::make_jar_classpath.  Now callers can control which files
          end up in the list.  In particular, they can have both .jar and .zip.

        - Added Java::Build::GenericBuild to be the top level controller of
          builds.
        - Added a demo directory to the distrubution to show how builds might
          be built.
        - Changed Java::Build::JVM so that compile error are fatal.
          All calls to its compile method should be eval'ed to trap errors.
        - Changed jar and jarsigner Tasks so they only log when their
          underlying call returns something.
        - Changed jar and jarsigner so they call croak when their underlying
          command fails.
        - Corrected jar so it doesn't stay in the base directory of the jar
          contents when it dies.  This is important for callers who are
          trapping fatal errors with eval.

0.02  Wed Aug 27 09:32:16 CDT 2003
        - Modified Java compiling code so that errors from javac are not
          dumped directly onto standard out.  Now when compile returns false,
          the caller should call dump_errors on the compiling object to
          retrieve the errors.
