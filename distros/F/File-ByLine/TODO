Todo Items:

  * Constructor should accept parameters
  * Better checking of parameters for OO mode
  * UTF-8 and other encoding support
  * Support CRLF line endings on all platforms (:crlf)
  * Documentation on parallel_ that these methods do a SEEK_EOF, so you
    shouldn't use them on things like terminal input.  There's a little
    note already, but it's not particularly clear.
  * A write routine wouldn't be a bad thing.
  * A more detailed CONTRIBUTING file
  * Ability to lock the file before read (particularly for use with the
    header option)
  * Ability to automically read file (copy to temp file, read, delete
    temp file)
  * The header_handler function and header_skip should handle multi-line
    headers.
