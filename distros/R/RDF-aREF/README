DESCRIPTION
    aREF (another RDF Encoding Form <http://gbv.github.io/aREF/>) is an
    encoding of RDF graphs in form of arrays, hashes, and Unicode strings.
    This module provides methods for decoding from aREF data to RDF triples
    (RDF::aREF::Decoder), for encoding RDF data in aREF
    (RDF::aREF::Encoder), and for querying parts of an RDF graph
    (RDF::aREF::Query).

EXPORTED FUNCTIONS
    The following functions are exported by default.

  decode_aref $aref [, %options ]
    Decodes an aREF document given as hash reference with
    RDF::aREF::Decoder. Equivalent to
    "RDF::aREF::Decoder->new(%options)->decode($aref)".

  encode_aref $graph [, %options ]
    Construct an aREF subject mapfrom an RDF graph. The RDF::aREF::Encoder
    for possible options. The $graph can be supplied as:

    *   instance of RDF::Trine::Model

    *   instance of RDF::Trine::Model::Iterator

    *   an URL or a filename (only if RDF::Trine is installed)

    *   instance of Attean::API::TripleIterator (experimental)

    *   instance of Attean::API::TripleStore (experimental)

    *   hash reference with RDF/JSON <http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-json/> format
        (as returned by method "as_hashref" in RDF::Trine::Model)

  aref_query $graph, [ $origin ], @queries
    Query parts of an aREF data structure by aREF query expressions
    <http://gbv.github.io/aREF/aREF.html#aref-query> and return a list. See
    RDF::aREF::Query for details.

  aref_query_map( $graph, [ $origin ], $query_map )
    Map parts of an aREF data structure to a flat key-value structure.

SEE ALSO
    *   aREF is specified at <http://github.com/gbv/aREF>.

    *   See Catmandu::RDF for an application of this module.

    *   Usee RDF::Trine for more elaborated handling of RDF data in Perl.

    *   See RDF::YAML for a similar (outdated) RDF encoding in YAML.
