	  - Image::Magick's Draw() method has an option, 'fill'. When I first wrote this module,
	  	fill's value defaulted to 'none', and now it defaults to something else. The effect is
		that when drawing a frame, the whole image is now filled in with black. Hence the patch
		to Image::Magick::Chart's draw_frame() method.
		I am tempted to rant and rave about the endless butchering of Image::Magick by its author,
		but that would not achieve anything... And anyway, it's an extremely useful module

1.02  2005-07-17T17:52:00
	- Add an option, y_axis_labels_x, which allows the user to specify the x-axis value
		(abscissa) at which to start writing y-axis labels. From the POD:
		The value, if not undef, determines the x-axis value (abscissa) at which y-axis labels are written.
		The special value undef means this module calculates an abscissa at which to start writing
		y-axis labels. The default behaviour is identical to the previous version 1.01.
		This calculation will only produce a pretty-looking column of y-axis labels when all labels are
		the same width in pixels. See C<sub draw_y_axis_labels()> for the calculation.
		The default value is undef.
		This parameter is optional.
