Tie-Cfg can now handle .ini files and you can access sections
just by using the tied hash as follows:

$ini{"$section}{$key"}="Set key $key in section $section";

print $ini{"$section}{$key"},"\n";

Tie-Cfg is a module to have simple configuration files
tied to a hash.

The configuration files have format:

<key>[:=]<value>

Empty lines are allowed, # <comment> is used for comments.
