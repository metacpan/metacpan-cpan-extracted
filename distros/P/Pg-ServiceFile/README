NAME

    Pg::ServiceFile - Basic PostgreSQL connection service file interface

SYNOPSIS

        use Pg::ServiceFile;
    
        # Uses $ENV{PGSERVICEFILE} or user's `~/.pg_service.conf` file
        my $pgservice = Pg::ServiceFile->new();
    
        # Use a specific service file - `pg_config --sysconfdir`/pg_service.conf
        my $pgservice = Pg::ServiceFile->new(file => '/etc/postgresql-common/pg_service.conf');
    
        # Print all the service names
        say $_ for @{$pgservice->names};
    
        # Get the username for a specific service name
        say $pgservice->services->{foo}->{user};

DESCRIPTION

    Pg::ServiceFile is a partially complete interface to the PostgreSQL
    connection service file. It's complete in the fact that it reads the
    $ENV{PGSERVICEFILE} or user service file as standard, but will not
    automatically retrieve and merge the system-wide service file or check
    PGSYSCONFDIR.

    If you know the connection service file you want to use, and just want
    the data as a HASH reference, you can use the simpler module
    Config::Pg::ServiceFile which has less dependencies and features.

ATTRIBUTES

    Pg::ServiceFile implements the following attributes.

 data

        my $pgservice = Pg::ServiceFile->new(data => <<~'PGSERVICEFILE');
            [foo]
            host=localhost
            port=5432
            user=foo
            dbname=db_foo
            password=password
        PGSERVICEFILE
    
        my $pgservice = Pg::ServiceFile->new(file => '~/.pg_service.conf');
        say $pgservice->data;

    The connection service file data. This is the contents of "file", or
    the data that has been passed in directly during instantiation.

 file

        my $pgservice = Pg::ServiceFile->new();
        say $pgservice->file; # ~/.pg_service.conf (if it exists)
    
        my $pgservice = Pg::ServiceFile->new(file => '~/myservice.conf');
        say $pgservice->file; # ~/myservice.conf

    Defaults to $ENV{PGSERVICEFILE} or ~/.pg_service.conf, but can be any
    valid connection service file.

 name

        local $ENV{PGSERVICE} = 'foo';
    
        my $pgservice = Pg::ServiceFile->new();
        say $pgservice->name; # foo
        say $pgservice->service->{dbname}; # db_foo

    The value of $ENV{PGSERVICE} if it exists, or whatever is set during
    instantiation. It does not check to see if a corresponding service
    entry exists in the service "file", but "service" will return the
    relevant data if it does.

 names

        my $pgservice = Pg::ServiceFile->new();
        say $_ for @{$pgservice->names};

    Returns the names of all the connection services from the service
    "file".

 service

        my $pgservice = Pg::ServiceFile->new(name => 'foo');
        say $pgservice->service->{dbname}; # db_foo

    If "name" has been set via $ENV{PGSERVICE} or on instantiation, returns
    the corresponding connection service. See "name".

 services

        my $pgservice = Pg::ServiceFile->new();
        while (my ($name, $service) = each %{$pgservice->services}) {
            say "[$name] $service->{dbname} at $service->{host}";
        }

    Returns a HASH of all of the connection services from "file".
