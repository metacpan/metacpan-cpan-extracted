NAME
    warnings::DynamicScope - Provides warning categories in dynamic scope.


DESCRIPTION
    This module provides warning categories in dynamic scope through the
    variable "%^W".

    You can use it like special variable "$^W":

     require warnings::DynamicScope;

     package MyPkg;
     use warnings::register;
 
     sub my_func {
         if ($^W{MyPkg}) {
             print "Don't do it!!\n";
         } else {
             print "That's fine\n";
         }
     }
 
     package main;
     $^W = 1;

     {
         local $^W{MyPkg} = 0;
         MyPkg::my_func();
     }
     MyPkg::my_func();

    This code prints:

     That's fine.
     Don't do it!!

    That's all.
