Revision history for Perl extension DBIx::Frame.

1.06	Wed May 26 09:11:40 CDT 2004 

	Minor changes in DBIx::Frame::CGI, mostly bug fixes and HTML changes.

	Documentation fixes all around.

	dbixframe.cgi and dbixframe_create.pl fixes to match what we've
	done elsewhere (mostly added documentation).

1.05	Tue Oct 21 13:32:09 CDT 2003 
	
	Renamed everything from 'DBI::Frame' to 'DBIx::Frame', so it's
	more capable of going into CPAN.

	DBIx::Frame
	  More documentation
	  Added new fields - REQUIRED, ADMIN, and ORDER, all of which 
	    are essentially optional but can be quite handy.  
          select() now works differently - if the old MATCH entry is 
	    a hash, we'll assume there's a lot of data in there and 
	    use it.  This lets us do more sophisticated queries and,
	    most importantly, use the ORDER stuff.
          Now using SelfLoader to improve load times.
          Various bugfixes.

        DBIx:Frame::CGI
          Added a 'quiet' option, for use with html_create() to not 
	    print "optional" information.  
          Now using SelfLoader to improve load times.
	  Various fairly minor bugfixes.
         

1.04	Wed Aug 14 16:21:06 CDT 2002

	Updated dbiframe.cgi to be more modular.

	DBI::Frame
          Split off set_html(), set_list(), etc.
          Added select_multi and _make_select_multi().
          Updated _replace() to work right, documented its full behaviour.
          Added the Helper Functions list of functions - select_fieldlist(),
            select_fieldlist_id(), and select_list_id().
    
	DBI::Frame::CGI 
          html_list_nosearch() split off to let other functions use it.
 	  Added 'tdopts' as an option.  
          Updated _firstentry() to use whole forms instead of links; this 
            looks much better, and works better too.
