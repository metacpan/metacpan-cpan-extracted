NAME
    Attribute::Property - Easy lvalue accessors with validation. ($foo->bar
    = 42)

SYNOPSIS
  CLASS
        use Attribute::Property;
        use Carp;

        package SomeClass;

        sub new : New { further initialization here ... }
    
        sub nondigits : Property { /^\D+\z/ }
        sub digits    : Property { /^\d+\z/ or croak "custom error message" }
        sub anyvalue  : Property;
        sub another   : Property;

        sub value     : Property {
            my $self = shift;  # Object is accessible as $_[0]
            s/^\s+//;          # New value can be altered through $_ or $_[1]

            $_ <= $self->maximum or croak "Value exceeds maximum";
        }

        package Person;

        sub new  : New;
        sub name : Property;
        sub age  : Property { /^\d+\z/ and $_ > 0 }

  USAGE
        my $object = SomeClass->new(digits => '123');

        $object->nondigits = "abc";
        $object->digits    = "123";
        $object->anyvalue  = "abc123\n";

        $object->anyvalue('archaic style still works');

        my $john = Person->new(name => 'John Doe', age => 19);
    
        $john->age++;
        printf "%s is now %d years old", $john->name, $john->age;

        # These would croak
        $object->nondigits = "987";
        $object->digits    = "xyz";

DESCRIPTION
    This module introduces two attributes that make object oriented
    programming much easier. You can just define a constructor and some
    properties without having to write accessors.

    "Property"
            sub color : Property;
            sub color : Property { /^#[0-9A-F]{6}$/ }

        The "Property" attribute turns a method into an object property. The
        original code block is used only to validate new values, the module
        croaks if it returns false. The method returns an *lvalue*, meaning
        that you can create a reference to it, assign to it and apply a
        regex to it.

        Undefined subs (subs that have been declared but do not have a code
        block) with the "Property" attribute will be properties without any
        value validation.

        In the validation code block, the object is in $_[0] and the value
        to be validated is aliased as $_[1] and for regexing convenience as
        $_.

        Feel free to croak explicitly if you don't want the default error
        message.

    "New"
            sub new : New;
            sub new : New { my $self = shift; ...; return $self; }

        The "New" attribute turns a method into an object constructor. The
        original code block can be used for further initialization, but it
        is completely optional.

        The constructor takes named arguments in "property => value" pairs
        and populates the hash with the given pairs. After validating them,
        of course.

        The new object is passed to the initialization code block as $_[0].
        Be sure to return the object if you use any initialization block. If
        there is no initialization code block, Attribute::Property takes
        care of returning the new object.

PREREQUISITES
    Your object must be a blessed hash reference. The property names will be
    used for the hash keys.

    For class properties of "Some::Module", the hash %Some::Module is used.
    For class properties of packages without "::", the behaviour is
    undefined.

    In short: "$foo->bar = 14" and "$foo->bar(14)" assign 14 to
    "$foo->{bar}" after positive validation. The same thing happens with "my
    $foo = Class->new(bar => 14);" given that "Class::new" uses the "New"
    property.

    If you have the Want module installed, Attribute::Property will use it
    to make rvalue method calls more efficient.

COMPATIBILITY
    Old fashioned "$object->property(VALUE)" is still available.

    This module requires a modern Perl (5.6.0+), fossils like Perl 5.00x
    don't support our chicanery.

BUGS
    * The "New" attribute should really be called "Constructor", but that
      would conflict with the existing Attribute::Constructor module.
