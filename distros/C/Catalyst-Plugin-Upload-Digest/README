NAME
    Catalyst::Plugin::Upload::Digest - Compute digest of uploads with Digest

SYNOPSIS
        use Catalyst qw< Upload::Digest >;

        if ( my $upload = $c->request->upload( 'field' ) ) {
            # Get Digest::Whirlpool object
            my $whirlpool = $upload->digest( 'Whirlpool' );

            # Get the digest of the uploaded file, addfile() has already
            # been called on its filehandle.
            my $hexdigest = $whirlpool->hexdigest;

            # I want a SHA-512 digest too!
            my $sha512digest = $upload->digest( 'SHA-512' )->digest;
        }

DESCRIPTION
    Extends "Catalyst::Request::Upload" with a "digest" method that wraps
    Digest's construction method. Any arguments to it will be passed
    directly to Digest's constructor. The return value is the relevant
    digest object that has already been populated with the file handle of
    the uploaded file, so retrieving its digest will work as expected.

EXAMPLE
    This module is distributed with a Catalyst example application called
    Upload::Digest, see the example/Upload-Digest directory in this
    distribution for how to run it.

CAVEATS
    To avoid being overly smart the "digest" method does not cache the
    digest for a given upload object / algorithm pair. If it is required to
    get the digest for a given file at two separate places in the program
    the user may wish to store the result somewhere to improve performance,
    or no do so because the speed of popular digest is likely not to become
    a bottleneck for most files.
