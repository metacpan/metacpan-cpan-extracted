Revision history for Perl extension Apache::AutoIndex.

0.08 Tue Jun 29 13:53:24 1999
 	- Added complete prototyping information into Makefile.PL since auto-parsing
	  for configuration directives doesn't seem to work on all platforms.
	- Thumbnail support now fully debugged (I think)

0.05 Fri Jan 29 04:00:23 1999
	Destroyed version 0.04! forgot one friggin debug variable set :<

0.04 Fri Jan 29 01:19:23 1999
	- Maintenance version
        - Added support for all mod_autoindex.c directives (+/- included)
	- At this point it should work with anything mod_autoindex.c could handle
	  maybe ignoring some directives, but it should produce an index anyway.
