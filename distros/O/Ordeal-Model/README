    Ordeal::Model - Manage cards and decks

VERSION

    This document describes Ordeal::Model version 0.004.

SYNOPSIS

       use Ordeal::Model;
    
       # leverage Ordeal::Model::Backend::PlainFile
       my $model = Ordeal::Model->new(PlainFile => [base_directory => $dir]);
    
       # get a card by identifier
       my $card = $model->get_card($card_id);
    
       # get a deck by identifier
       my $deck = $model->get_deck($deck_id);
    
       # evaluate a complex expression, getting a "shuffle" back
       my $shuffle = $model->evaluate($expression, %args);
    
       # you can pre-compute the parsing of an expression, e.g. for caching
       my $ast = $model->parse($expression);
       $shuffle = $model->evaluate($ast, %args);
    
       # override to provide an alternative resolution algorithm
       my $backend_class = $model->resolve_backend_name($some_name);

DESCRIPTION

    This document is about Ordeal::Model, a module allows you to manage
    cards and group them into decks. The main goal is to provide an easy
    mean to shuffle decks and get some cards out of them.

    In the document you will find a reference for the main module. If you
    are interested into using it, head to Ordeal::Model::Tutorial which
    provides a gentler introduction.

METHODS

 evaluate

       my $shuffle = $model>evaluate($expression_or_ast, %args);

    Evaluate an input expression, or the AST resulting from its parsing.
    Calls "parse" if the input is not already in AST form. See
    Ordeal::Model::Parser for the gory details about the grammar accepted
    for expressions, and to the code for Ordeal::Model::Evaluator to figure
    out how to structure an AST (which you should not need to!). For a
    gentler introduction (who loves to read a grammar, after all?!?) see
    Ordeal::Model::Tutorial.

    The optional additional arguments in %args are used for random source
    selection if there is any suitable key among the following:

    random_source

      a random source conforming to the interface provided by
      Ordeal::Model::ChaCha20;

    random_source_state

      opaque data useful for fully restoring the state of a random data in
      an instance of Ordeal::Model::ChaCha20;

    seed

      seed value used for creating a new instance of
      Ordeal::Model::ChaCha20.

    The key above are in order of precedence, i.e. random_source is tried
    first, then random_source_state, then seed at last.

    This method returns an Ordeal::Model::Shuffle object that you can use
    to draw cards from, e.g.:

       my @two_cards        = $shuffle->draw(2);
       my @three_more_cards = $shuffle->draw(3);

    Be careful that Ordeal::Model::Shuffle will throw an exception if you
    try to draw more cards than available!

 get_card

       my $card = $model->get_card($id);

    get an Ordeal::Model::Card by identifier.

 get_deck

       my $deck = $model->get_deck($id);

    get an Ordeal::Model::Deck by identifier.

 get_deck_ids

       my @ids = $model_>get_deck_ids;

    get a list of available deck identifiers. Each can be used with
    "get_deck" to load a deck.

 new

       my $model = Ordeal::Model->new(%args); # OR
       my $model = Ordeal::Model->new(\%args);

    constructor.

    The %args hash can contain only one key/value pair. If the key is
    backend, then the value MUST be either a blessed object to be used as
    backend, or an array reference with information suitable for generating
    one. In particular, the array form should contain a name that can be
    resolved through "resolve_backend_name" as the first item, and any
    argument for the resolved class as the remaining items, in order as
    they are supposed to be consumed by its new method.

    Otherwise, the key is considered a name suitable for
    "resolve_backend_name", and the associated value MUST be an array/hash
    reference that is expanded and passed to the new method associated to
    the class resolved from the name.

    Too complicated? A few examples will hopefull help:

       use Ordeal::Model::Backend::PlainFile;
       my $pf = Ordeal::Model::Backend::PlainFile->new;
    
       # Case: backend => $blessed_reference
       my $m1 = Ordeal::Model->new(backend => $pf);
    
       # Case: backend => $array_ref
       my $m2 = Ordeal::Model->new(
          backend => [PlainFile => base_directory => '/some/path']);
    
       # Case: key different from 'backend', points to an array reference
       my $m3 = Ordeal::Model->new(PlainFile => [base_directory => '/some/path']);
    
       # Case: key different from 'backend', points to a hash reference
       my $m4 = Ordeal::Model->new(PlainFile => {base_directory => '/some/path'});

    If %args contains nothing, then Ordeal::Model::Backend::PlainFile is
    used with default parameters for its constructor.

 parse

       my $ast = $model>parse($expression);

    Parse an expression and return an AST suitable for "evaluate".

 random_source

       # in constructor
       Ordeal::Model->new(random_source => $rs, ...);
    
       my $rs = $shuffler>random_source;
       $shuffler>random_source($rs);

    Accessor for the source of randomness. It defaults to an instance of
    Ordeal::Model::ChaCha20, set at construction time. It MAY be used by
    "evaluate" unless it is overridden by arguments.

 resolve_backend_name

       my $class_name = $model->resolve_backend_name($name);
       my $class_name = $package>resolve_backend_name($name);

    resolve a $name for a backend to use - this is a class method.

    The resolution process is as follows:

      * if $name begins with a -, then it is considered directly the class
      name to be used after removing the initial - character. Examples:

         $name = '-Whatever';         # resolves to class Whatever
         $name = '-Whatever::Module'; # resolves to class Whatever::Module

      * otherwise, if it contains ::, but does not begin with ::, then it
      is again considered as the full name to use for the class. Example:

         $name = 'Whatever::Module';  # resolves to class Whatever::Module

      * otherwise, it is used to search for a candidate class, first in
      namespace $package . '::Backend::', then in namespace
      Ordeal::Model::Backend::. Examples (assuming that the package you
      call it with is Ordeal::Model):

         $name = 'Whatever'; # resolves to Ordeal::Model::Backend::Whatever
         $name = '::W::Ever': # resolves to Ordeal::Model::Backend::W::Ever

    If you want to be on the safe side, always pre-pend :: if you want to
    activate the automatic search for a backend class, and always pre-pend
    - if you want to specify the full backend class name.

    This method is used by "new" behind the scenes, so you can override it
    to provide a different resolution algorithm.

BUGS AND LIMITATIONS

    The code leverages some experimental Perl features like signatures and
    postderef; for this reason, at least perl 5.20 will be needed.
