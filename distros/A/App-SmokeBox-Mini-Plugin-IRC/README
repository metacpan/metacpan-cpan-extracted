DESCRIPTION
    App::SmokeBox::Mini::Plugin::IRC is an IRC plugin for
    App::SmokeBox::Mini and minismokebox that announces on IRC channels when
    smoke jobs finish and when minismokebox itself finishes.

    Configuration is handled by a section in the minismokebox configuration
    file.

    When minismokebox starts a bot will join configured channels and start
    announcing completed smoke jobs. When the smoke run finishes the bot
    will announce statistics relating to the smoke run and then terminate.
