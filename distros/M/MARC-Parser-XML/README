NAME

    MARC::Parser::XML - Parser for MARC XML records

SYNOPSIS

        use MARC::Parser::XML;
    
        my $parser = MARC::Parser::XML->new( 't/marc.xml' );
    
        while ( my $record = $parser->next() ) { 
            # do something ...
        }

DESCRIPTION

    MARC::Parser::XML is a lightweight, fault tolerant parser for MARC XML
    records. Tags, indicators and subfield codes are not validated against
    the MARC standard. The resulting data structure is optimized for usage
    with the Catmandu data tool kit.

MARC

    The MARC record is parsed into an ARRAY of ARRAYs:

        $record = [
                [ 'LDR', undef, undef, '_', '00661nam  22002538a 4500' ],
                [ '001', undef, undef, '_', 'fol05865967 ' ],
                ...
                [   '245', '1', '0', 'a', 'Programming Perl /',
                    'c', 'Larry Wall, Tom Christiansen & Jon Orwant.'
                ],
                ...
            ];
