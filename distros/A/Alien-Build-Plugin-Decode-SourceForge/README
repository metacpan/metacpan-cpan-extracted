NAME

    Alien::Build::Plugin::Decode::SourceForge - Alien::Build plugin to
    handle SourceForge links

VERSION

    version 0.02

SYNOPSIS

     use alienfile;
     
     plugin 'Decode::SourceForge';

DESCRIPTION

    SourceForge is a website that offers software developers a centralized
    online location to manage their Open Source projects. One of the
    challenges it presents is that projects hosted by SourceForge add the
    unnecessary suffix /download to links of tarballs, which confuses the
    way Alien::Base computes the filename based on URLs. This plugin solves
    this problem by rewriting the filenames returned by the configured
    decode plugin.
