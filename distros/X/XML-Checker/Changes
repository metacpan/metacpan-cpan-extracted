Change History:

0.13 (tjmather) 9/11/2002
- make parse return 1 (Steven Allen)
- sub setModel: Generation of regexp goes wrong if an element has more than
  62 members and any of these has cardinality other than 1:
  Parentheses are required around each re token, because the tokens are
  encoded as character pairs if there's 62 or more of them. (B Mills)

0.12 (tjmather) 4/22/2002
- Fixed bug with DTD alternation rules (Steven Allen)

0.11 (tjmather) 4/8/2002
- Corrected the token abbreviation sub (Philippe Verdret)
- Added error 170, Element can't be empty (Philippe Verdret)
- Added strict and warnings pragmas (Philippe Verdret)
- Added two new tests, t/empty_elt.t and t/high_elt_number.t
    (Philippe Verdret)

0.10 (tjmather) 9/2/2001
- Fixed bug where checker didn't raise an error where a element
  that should have only contained sub-elements contained a text
  element (Michel Rodriguez)
- Moved XML::DOM::ValParser into correct directory

libxml-enno-1.04 (tjmather) 3/20/2001

- Fixed bug in XML::Checker::Parser with the setting 
  @InterceptedHandlers (William Horka)
- Fixed errors in test case t/chk_batch.t.  Most had to do with change
  from "well-formed" to "well-formed (invalid token)" in error message.
  Also, the tests in chk_batch.t for the xml file attr3 did not return any
  errors any more, since XML::Parser >= 2.28 doesn't seem to call the entity
  handler more than once if a entity is repeated.
- Updated t/chk_batch.t to be independent of the order of the error
  messages generated.  This is because the order of the error messages
  seems to be dependent on the version of perl used (e.g. 5.005 vs. 5.6.0).

libxml-enno-1.03 (enno) unreleased

- Fixed errors in test case t/chk_batch.t for Windows. Most were related
  to differences in newlines. 

0.09 in libxml-enno-1.01 (enno) 2/17/2000

- error 103 (undefined attribute) was not detected in all cases.
  (Thanks to Mark Hewis <mark@talbat.demon.co.uk>)
- error 103 - The error context used to contain the hash key 'Elem', 
  but since all other errors use 'Element', this was changed to 'Element'
  as well.
- The parsefile() method of XML::Checker::Parser now supports URLs.
  It uses LWP to download the remote file. See XML::Checker::Parser documentation
  for more info.
- Fixed attlist_decl() handler to use 'ElementName' instead of 'EntityName'.

0.08 in libxml-enno-1.00 (enno) 10/26/1999

- XML::Checker moved to libxml-enno distribution.
- XML::Checker now implements the PerlSAX Handler interface.
- Fixed XML::Checker::Parser to use XML::Parser::Expat::specified_attr to
  determine which attributes were specified (and which were defaulted by expat.)
  (I was using original_string before and parsing the string myself to
  figure out which attributes were specified, but there was a bug in my code
  which would generate bogus error-159's.)
  (Thanks to Jim Anderson <jander@ml.com>)
- External DTDs with relative file paths (and without the 'file://' prefix)
  are now located using SGML_SEARCH_PATH.
  See XML::Checker::Parser pod for details.
  (Thanks to Stephane Bortzmeyer <bortzmeyer@pasteur.fr>)
- XML::Checker::DOM is now obsolete. I moved the functionality to XML::DOM.
- The error descriptions in the XML::Checker manual page now have links to
  the appropriate sections and Validity Constraints in the XML spec.

0.07 (enno) 9/10/1999
- Fixed checking of NOTATION tokens in an ATTLIST. It would allow only valid
  XML Name ($ReName) values instead of NmTokens ($ReNmToken)
  (Thanks to Laurent Caprani <caprani@multimania.com>)
- Added error 115: "ELEMENT [$name] already defined"
  (Thanks to Laurent Caprani <caprani@multimania.com>)
- Added 'Element' to the error context of error 124
- Fixed checking of #REQUIRED attributes (error 159.)
  I had to add another handler to XML::Checker, called 'EndAttr', to support 
  checking of #REQUIRED attributes. 
  It should be called after all attributes are passed with Attr().
  If the user forgets to call this method, missing #REQUIRED attributes (i.e.
  error 159) will not be generated.
  XML::Checker::Parser and XML::DOM::ValParser have been updated accordingly,
  so users of these classes don't need to make any code changes. Only people
  using XML::Checker directly have to add a call to EndAttr().
  (Thanks to Jim Anderson <jander@ml.com>)
- Default attribute values were stored in ARule as $arule->{$attr}->{Default}.
  This could wipe out other ARule fields (like Elem, Checker and Required) if
  your XML file contained attributes with those names. Now they are stored as
  $arule->{Default}->{$attr}.

0.06 (enno) 8/10/1999
- Added option to detect insignificant whitespace. 
  See the section 'INSIGNIFICANT WHITESPACE' in the XML::Checker maual page
  and the SkipInsignifWS option in XML::Checker::Parser.
- Added Comment handler to XML::Checker for completeness. It currently
  doesn't do anything.
- Added t/filterInsignifWS.pl script that filters insignificant whitespace
  using XML::DOM::ValParser (see script for USAGE)

0.05 (enno) 8/2/1999
- Fixed the regular expressions for XML tokens to include Unicode values > 127

0.04 (enno) 6/29/1999
- Fixed splitting of Enumeration tokens in ATTLIST.
  It used to split the tokens with /\s+/, instead of /\s*\|\s*/ and it would
  produce error 134.
  (Thanks to Philippe Verdret <pverdret@sonovision-itep.fr>)
- When parsing the external DTD in XML::Checker::Parser, the XML::Parser now
  copies the ErrorContext from the XML::Checker::Parser.
  (Thanks to Philippe Verdret <pverdret@sonovision-itep.fr>)
- When parsing the external DTD in XML::Checker::Parser, it now prefixes the
  System ID with 'file:' because HTTP::Request is used to retrieve the external 
  DTD and it expects 'file:' prefixes for file URLs.
  (Thanks to Stephane Bortzmeyer <stephane@sources.org>)
- It no longer generates error 156: unexpected root Element [doc], expected []
  when no DTD is available and it doesn't know what the root element is.
- Cleaned up some warnings when running with perl -w.
  (Thanks to Beau Simensen <altern8@dnai.com>)
- Added CAVEATS section to XML::Checker::Parser POD regarding external DTDs.

0.03 (enno) 6/23/1999
- Fixed message 154 to print out better Buf and RE parameters.
- Fixed the RE (regular expression) that is used to check valid element names.
  (Thanks to Matt Sergeant <matt@sergeant.org>)
- Added code that reads external DTDs using LWP.
  This can be disabled by setting the XML::Checker property SkipExternalDTD.
  (Thanks to Matt Sergeant <matt@sergeant.org> for writing the code!)

0.02 (enno) 5/28/1999
- Updated the regular expressions for the following tokens: Name, NmToken, 
  AttValue. For now, I copied some of them from XML::DOM, but they should probably
  be in a separate module. (Thanks to John Posner <jjp@oreilly.com>)
- XML::DOM::EntityReference::expat_iter was using getName instead of getEntityName
- fixed bugs in XML::Checker::EntityRef
- XML::DOM::Notation::expat_iter was calling the Entity handler
- implemented the XML::Checker::Entity method to check for duplicate ENTITY
  definitions and added error 114 - ENTITY [$entity] already defined
- modified the test scripts to pass (KeepCDATA => 1, NoExpand => 1) to XML::Parser

0.01 (enno) 5/27/1999
- First release.
