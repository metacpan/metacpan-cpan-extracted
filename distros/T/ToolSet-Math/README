NAME

    ToolSet::Math - Bring in common math functions and constants.

SYNOPSIS

      use ToolSet::Math;

    is equivalent to:

      use List::Util qw(max min sum sum0);
      use Math::Trig;
      use Math::Complex;
      use Math::Complex ":pi";
      use POSIX qw(ceil floor modf pow round isfinite isinf isnan);

    Also, several constants are defined as well:

      E LN2 LN10
      PI PI2 PI4 PIP2 PIP4
      SQRT2 SQRT5 SQRT1_2 GOLDENR
      Inf nan NaN NAN
      FLT_EPSILON DBL_EPSILON

    In addition, two functions are automatically exported: log2 for base-2
    logarithm, and fac for factorial.

DESCRIPTION

    This module automatically exports convenience math functions and
    constants which are not available by default in Perl, such as ceil,
    floor, round, log10 and trigonometric ones like tan, asin, cosec, and
    deg2rad. It also sets up support for complex numbers to expand Perl's
    math capabilities.

    See Math::Trig and Math::Complex for details on all exported functions.
