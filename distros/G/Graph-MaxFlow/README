NAME
    Graph::MaxFlow - compute maximum flow between 2 vertices in a graph

SYNOPSIS
      use Graph::MaxFlow qw(max_flow);

      my $g = new Graph;
      # construct graph
      my $flow = max_flow($g, "source", "sink");

DESCRIPTION
    Computes the maximum flow in a graph, represented using Jarkko
    Hietaniemi's Graph.pm module.

FUNCTIONS
    This module provides the following function:

    max_flow($g, $s, $t)
        Computes the maximum flow in the graph $g between vertices $s and $t
        using the Edmonds-Karp algorithm. $g must be a Graph.pm object, and
        must be a directed graph where the edge weights indicate the
        capacity of each edge. The edge weights must be nonnegative. $s and
        $t must be vertices in the graph. The graph $g must be connected,
        and for every vertex v besides $s and $t there must be a path from
        $s to $t that passes through v.

        The return value is a new directed graph which has the same vertices
        and edges as $g, but where the edge weights have been adjusted to
        indicate the flow along each edge.
