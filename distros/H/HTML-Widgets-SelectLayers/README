HTML::Widgets::SelectLayers
===========================

This module implements an HTML widget with multiple layers.  Only one layer
is visible at any given time, controlled by a <SELECT> box.  For an example
see http://www.420.am/selectlayers/

This HTML generated by this module uses JavaScript, but nevertheless attempts
to be as cross-browser as possible, testing for features via DOM support rather
than specific browsers or versions.  It has been tested under Mozilla
0.9.8->1.4, Netscape 4.77, IE 5.5, Konqueror 2.2.2->3.1.5, and Opera 5.0.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install
