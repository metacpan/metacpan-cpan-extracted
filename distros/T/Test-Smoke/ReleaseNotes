=head1 NAME

ReleaseNotes - These are the Release Notes for 1.30

=head1 SYNOPSIS

These are the major changes since version 1.20

=head1 DESCRIPTION

You will need to rerun F<configsmoke.pl> in order to use the new
Test::Harness 3 parallel testing feature.

=over 4

=item 0

Remove all the cruft from F<Makefile.PL>, so it's more standard.

=item 1

I moved L<Mail::Sendmail> so it will be installed but no longer looks
like a part of the distribution.

=item 2

I moved all the default configuration files to the Test/Smoke library
directory (easier in standard install).

=item 3

I added support for L<Test::Harness> 3. This is for extending test
failures with harness and to take advantage of the new parallel
testing option in this version of the harness.

=item 4

I changed my mind about version numbering. I'll just use X.YY from now on.
