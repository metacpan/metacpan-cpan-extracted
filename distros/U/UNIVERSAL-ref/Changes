Revision history for UNIVERSAL::ref

0.01    Feb 25, 2007
        First version, released on an unsuspecting world.

0.02    Mar 6, 2007
        Now with tests for overloading too. It doesn't pass tests but
        that's the point. I'd like the CPAN version to fail its tests.

        Moved the hook logic into perl from XS.
        Uses 5.10's ->DOES when possible.
        Separates out the idea of hooked classes and classes that need
        the truth.
