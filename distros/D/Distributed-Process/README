Distributed-Process

This module provides a framework for running a process simultaneously on
several machines.

It was first designed to conduct stress tests session, where several computers
would send queries to a server at the same time, but it might prove useful for
other purposes.

This distribution provides code to run server to conduct the "workers", and to
run the clients that do the actual work.

The task to distribute must be implemented in a subclass of
Distributed::Process::Worker, by overloading its run() method.

Please read the documentation for Distributed::Process for further details, and
remember that this is still alpha code.
