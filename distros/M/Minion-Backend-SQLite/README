NAME

    Minion::Backend::SQLite - SQLite backend for Minion job queue

SYNOPSIS

      use Minion::Backend::SQLite;
      my $backend = Minion::Backend::SQLite->new('sqlite:test.db');
    
      # Minion
      use Minion;
      my $minion = Minion->new(SQLite => 'sqlite:test.db');
    
      # Mojolicious (via Mojolicious::Plugin::Minion)
      $self->plugin(Minion => { SQLite => 'sqlite:test.db' });
    
      # Mojolicious::Lite (via Mojolicious::Plugin::Minion)
      plugin Minion => { SQLite => 'sqlite:test.db' };
    
      # Share the database connection cache
      helper sqlite => sub { state $sqlite = Mojo::SQLite->new('sqlite:test.db') };
      plugin Minion => { SQLite => app->sqlite };

DESCRIPTION

    Minion::Backend::SQLite is a backend for Minion based on Mojo::SQLite.
    All necessary tables will be created automatically with a set of
    migrations named minion. If no connection string or :temp: is provided,
    the database will be created in a temporary directory.

ATTRIBUTES

    Minion::Backend::SQLite inherits all attributes from Minion::Backend
    and implements the following new ones.

 dequeue_interval

      my $seconds = $backend->dequeue_interval;
      $backend    = $backend->dequeue_interval($seconds);

    Interval in seconds between "dequeue" attempts. Defaults to 0.5.

 sqlite

      my $sqlite = $backend->sqlite;
      $backend   = $backend->sqlite(Mojo::SQLite->new);

    Mojo::SQLite object used to store all data.

METHODS

    Minion::Backend::SQLite inherits all methods from Minion::Backend and
    implements the following new ones.

 new

      my $backend = Minion::Backend::SQLite->new;
      my $backend = Minion::Backend::SQLite->new(':temp:');
      my $backend = Minion::Backend::SQLite->new('sqlite:test.db');
      my $backend = Minion::Backend::SQLite->new->tap(sub { $_->sqlite->from_filename('C:\\foo\\bar.db') });
      my $backend = Minion::Backend::SQLite->new(Mojo::SQLite->new);

    Construct a new Minion::Backend::SQLite object.

 broadcast

      my $bool = $backend->broadcast('some_command');
      my $bool = $backend->broadcast('some_command', [@args]);
      my $bool = $backend->broadcast('some_command', [@args], [$id1, $id2, $id3]);

    Broadcast remote control command to one or more workers.

 dequeue

      my $job_info = $backend->dequeue($worker_id, 0.5);
      my $job_info = $backend->dequeue($worker_id, 0.5, {queues => ['important']});

    Wait a given amount of time in seconds for a job, dequeue it and
    transition from inactive to active state, or return undef if queues
    were empty. Jobs will be checked for in intervals defined by
    "dequeue_interval" until the timeout is reached.

    These options are currently available:

    id

        id => '10023'

      Dequeue a specific job.

    queues

        queues => ['important']

      One or more queues to dequeue jobs from, defaults to default.

    These fields are currently available:

    args

        args => ['foo', 'bar']

      Job arguments.

    id

        id => '10023'

      Job ID.

    retries

        retries => 3

      Number of times job has been retried.

    task

        task => 'foo'

      Task name.

 enqueue

      my $job_id = $backend->enqueue('foo');
      my $job_id = $backend->enqueue(foo => [@args]);

    Enqueue a new job with inactive state.

    These options are currently available:

    attempts

        attempts => 25

      Number of times performing this job will be attempted, with a delay
      based on "backoff" in Minion after the first attempt, defaults to 1.

    delay

      Delay job for this many seconds (from now).

        notes => {foo => 'bar', baz => [1, 2, 3]}

      Hash reference with arbitrary metadata for this job.

    parents

        parents => [$id1, $id2, $id3]

      transitioned to the state finished before it can be processed.

    priority

        priority => 5

      Job priority, defaults to 0. Jobs with a higher priority get
      performed first.

        $job_id, $retries, {msg => 'Something went wrong!'});

    there are attempts remaining, transition back to inactive with an
    exponentially increasing delay based on "backoff" in Minion.
