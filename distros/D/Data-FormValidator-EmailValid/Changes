    - rewrite tests to be more resilient to possible DNS/mxcheck issues
    - move POD tests into "xt/"

0.04    Thu Nov 12 16:18 PST 2015
    - update tests to use "@cpan.org" instead of "@example.com"; example.com no
      longer has a published MX record and so tests were failing

    - first public release
