	* lib/PDF/Burst.pm, lib/PDF/Burst.pod, t/10_problemfile.dev.t,
	  t/multiple_page_problem.t: Using pdftk burst method, if you burst
	  2 different files in the same directory, and they have diff page
	  counts, (if the first has 5 pages, and the second 2), we return
	  the most page docs matched A hack has been requested/placed to
	  help ameliorate this.  What it does is, pdftk places a
	  doc_data.txt file in the current working directory that holds how
	  many pages there were in the document, we try to find that file
	  (doc_data.txt) and read it for count of pages, and then compare
	  to what we got.

	  This is a hack solution. The real solution is not to burst two
	  files with the same filename in the same directory.  Or to clean
	  up afterwards.

	* lib/PDF/Burst.pm, t/00_find_which_burst_works.t, t/01_burst14.t:
	  there were some errors using warnings that did not mean anything
	  that were taken out by either code change or no warnings
	  statements.

	* lib/PDF/Burst.pm, lib/PDF/Burst.pod, t/01_burst14.t: moved doc to
	  separate .pod file.  added more documentation added better
	  reporting on test failure

	* lib/PDF/Burst.pm: Added a simple way to change the method that
	  pdf_burst uses.  Before I used a hard coded alias from
	  *PDF::Burst::pdf_burst to PDF::Burst::pdf_burst_CAM_PDF, Now we
	  set the name in $PDF::Burst::BURST_METHOD , one of pdftk,
	  PDF_API2, CAM_PDF.

	* lib/PDF/Burst.pm, t/01_burst14.t: Made it so there's a nice
	  $PDF::Burst::errstr that holds errors instead of dying, so any
	  fails may be treated as pdf_burst('./file.pdf') or
	  die($PDF::Burst::errstr); added a 'fail' test for this.  Also
	  cleaned up the doc synopsis a bit and added more see also
	  references.

	* lib/PDF/Burst.pm, t/00_burst.t, t/00bust.pl, t/02_burst_scan1.t,
	  t/pdfapi2-burst.pl: I am adding both CAM::PDF and PDF::API2
	  methods of bursting a pdf.  pdf_burst is pointing to the CAM::PDF
	  method by default.
