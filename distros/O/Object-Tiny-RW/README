NAME
    Object::Tiny::RW - Class building as simple as it gets (with rw
    accessors)

SYNOPSIS
      # Define a class
      package Foo;
  
      use Object::Tiny::RW qw{ bar baz };
  
      1;
  
      # Use the class
      my $object = Foo->new( bar => 1 );
  
      print "bar is " . $object->bar . "\n";       # 1
      $object->bar(2);
      print "bar is now " . $object->bar . "\n";   # 2

DESCRIPTION
    This module is a fork of Object::Tiny. The only difference is that it
    also accepts arguments to it's accessors to set the according value.

    Please see Object::Tiny for all the original ideas.

    To use Object::Tiny::RW, just call it with a list of accessors to be
    created.

      use Object::Tiny::RW 'foo', 'bar';
