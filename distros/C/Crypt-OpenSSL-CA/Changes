0.20    27 Aug 2010
      - Yet another cpan-testers-bugfix-only release (YACTBOR). Work around a
        breakage in Test::Group introduced by the new Test::Builder.

0.19    14 Feb 2008
      - YACTBOR for FreeBSD with ccache and another OpenSSL setup lacking basic
        dignity

0.18    12 Sep 2008
      - YACTBOR; don't try to use `openssl req` to create a PKCS#10, as this is
        known to fail on OpenSSL-installation-challenged cpan-testers systems.

0.17    14 Feb 2008
      - YACTBOR.  Fixes spurious test failures with FreeBSD 6.2's backward
        OpenSSL.

0.16    14 Feb 2008
      - YACTBOR.  Can now detect OpenSSL version before attempting the
        whole compile despite CPAN.pm's quirks.
