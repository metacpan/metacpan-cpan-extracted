                                 thing" when comparing objects that overload
                                 numification and stringification

                                 tests - something's a bit broken around

1.23    2013-09-26  DCANTRELL  Add David Muir Sharnoff's tests for
                                 really big data structures (but not yet
                                 working);
                               Check for taint-mode less insanely, thanks

1.22    2010-02-12  DCANTRELL  Previous release was in error.  Instead, fix
                                 the problem, circular structures now
                                 compare equal, no matter what the starting
                                 point (see RT 52836)

1.21    2008-08-21  DCANTRELL  Extra tests added in 1.20 now skip with

                                 Nalagandla (no bug found, but you can never
                                 have too many tests!)
                               Fixed bug in PERL5LIB splitting in taint test
                                 (thanks to ADAMK, see RT 38319)

1.18    2008-01-15  DCANTRELL  Got rid of prototypes;
                               File::Find::Rule now only loads when needed;
                               Plugins can be ignored with a null import() list;
                               Explicitly documented the auto-export;
                               Got rid of diagnostics pragma

                               Fixed problem with taint testing when PERL5LIB
                                 is set (thanks to Andreas Koenig for finding
                                 the bug)
                               Minor doco fiddling

0.13    2004-11-09  DCANTRELL  Oops, left in some debugging output
0.12    2004-11-09  DCANTRELL  Fixed recursion detection bug - wasn't decrementing
                               counter properly!  (thanks to Jenda for the bug
                               report)
0.11    2004-06-02  DCANTRELL  Now taint-safe - in taint mode there's no plugins
                               (thanks Gabor Szabo for reporting the bug)
0.10    2004-03-13  DCANTRELL  Replaced recursion detection with Rusty Conover's

                               once.  S::P plugin renamed so it would work with
                               this bugfix.  Clean-up of code.  Fix minor doc-bug
                               in lib/Data/Compare/Plugins.pod.
