Revision history for Perl extension Perlbal::Plugin::SessionAffinity

0.110   22.04.19
        * GH #1: Handle inexistent tunable keys in a locked hashed of a
          service.  This was presented when using SessionAffinity with
          Throttle.
          (Thanks, Slaven Rezić!)
        * GH #1: Handle tunable values for services that were stored as
          arrayrefs by flattening them to comma-separated values.
          (Slaven Rezić)
        * Tests less verbose.

0.101   14.10.16
        * Provide a META.json file.

0.100   15.09.14
        * Craziness ensued. You can now have almost-random cookie names
          based on the request's domain.

0.010   18.12.13
        * Copy over extra_config and extra_headers from the original service.
        * Document possible incompatibilities.

0.008   21.10.12
        * Fix breakage of non-XS headers.

0.007   21.10.12
        * Handle Perlbal::XS::HTTPHeaders too.

0.006   11.10.12
        * Add "domain mode" - use_domain to handle fragmented cache.
        * Doc fixes/cleanups.

0.005   01.08.12
        * Affinity salt is now off by default.
        * You can now set salt on using AFFINITY_USE_SALT.
        * Make configurations more relaxed by allowing prefixed spaces.
        * Remove Carp dependency, it wasn't used.

0.004   15.07.12
        * Fix crash caused by "use fields" in Perlbal. Pfff...

0.003   14.07.12
        * Docs reversal.

0.002   12.07.12
        * affinity_cookie_header and affinity_salt are now production.
          (the worked before, but now they're documented to be working)
        * Removing pluggable fetching of backends since Perlbal already
          picks them up without asking us and the user should actually
          play with the pool if s/he want such stuff.
        * Lots of code fixups/cleanups.
        * Some docs fixups. Expect more. :)

0.001   11.07.12
        * Works, damn it!
