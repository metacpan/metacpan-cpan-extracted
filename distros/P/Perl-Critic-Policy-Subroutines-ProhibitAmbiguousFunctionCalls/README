NAME

    Perl::Critic::Policy::Subroutines::ProhibitAmbiguousFunctionCalls -
    Don't call fully qualified function methods without parens

DESCRIPTION

    When writing code like this...

      Some::Class::Name::foo->mymethod

    ..it is not clear if 'foo' is part of the class, or a function within
    Some::Class::Name. The better way to write it is:

      Some::Class::Name::foo()->method

CONFIGURATION

    method_always_ok (string list, default is "new add")

      A list of method names which should always be considered "ok"

    uppercase_module_always_ok (boolean, defaults to true)

      Indicates whether module names starting with an uppercase letter are
      considered "ok".

      For example, Foo::Bar->pop; is considered ok by default, but
      Foo::bar->pop is not.
