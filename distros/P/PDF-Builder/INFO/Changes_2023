3.026     2023-12-07

    lib/PDF/Builder/Content/Text.pm, examples/Column.pl
     Add HTML "reversed" (boolean) to <ol> tag to count down instead of up 
      (needs "start" value to make any sense). 

      I wanted to fix a few more minor problems with column(), including the
      color of the first text in a <li> overriding the marker color, a bunch
      of redundant font and color change commands and some other 
      inefficiencies, and some other stuff. Unfortunately, that looks like a 
      considerable rewrite of column(), and I ran out of runway, so I'll have 
      to put it off to the next release.

    lib/PDF/Builder/Content.pm
     Add some POD notes about the use of charspace for tracking adjustments,
      and the interaction with wordspace adjustments for a more balanced
      appearance of justified text.

    devtools/
     A collection of various utilities I use to build PDF::Builder (the CPAN
      package), as well as do the PHP conversion of HTML code for the web page
      display of documentation (see catskilltech.com). Note that buildDoc.pl
      (to build all the HTML files from POD) is already shipped with the
      package. Further note that tools/1_pc.pl (Perl Critic) will complain
      a LOT about the code in devtools/ ... maybe some day I'll get around to
      cleaning it up.

    (many .pm files), META.yml, Makefile.PL, README.md, docs/buildDoc.pl,
      t/00-all-usable.t, tools/optional_update.pl, version
     Cleanup of POD so that unordered/bulleted lists, ordered/numbered lists,
      definition/description lists, and indented paragraphs are properly
      handled upon conversion to HTML. Change optional POD-to-HTML generation 
      from the old pod2html to Pod::Simple::XHTML.

    lib/PDF/Builder/Content.pm
     The linedash() method was not properly handling a restore of a saved
      dash pattern, resulting in PDF "dash pattern" values that could be
      unusable by a Reader.

    lib/PDF/Builder.pm, lib/PDF/Builder/FontManager.pm, 
      lib/PDF/Builder/Content/Text.pm, t/03-xrefstm-index.t
     Continuing Issue #197, clean up handling of newly-created PDF object
      in from_string() method (used by open() method). Also knock-on effects
      on some t-tests.

    lib/PDF/Basic/PDF/Pages.pm
     Issue #203 a new page was being inserted in the wrong place. Thanks to
      Vadim Repin for finding a "one off" index error that's apparently been 
      there for at least a decade, and the fix.

    lib/PDF/Builder.pm, lib/PDF/Builder/Basic/PDF/File.pm
     Improve upon the Integrity Check, acknowledging that missing objects
      might be hidden in an object stream. The open() function was also 
      sometimes seeing a class reference rather than a pure class, which has
      been fixed. See issue #196 and especially #197.

    lib/PDF/Builder.pm, lib/PDF/Builder/Content.pm, examples/060_transparency,
      INFO/KNOWN_INCOMP, tools/1_pc.pl
     Remove ability to generate save() ("q") and restore() ("Q") while in a
      text object. If attempted in text, it is now a no-op with a one-time
      (per run) warning message reminding users to update their code NOT to
      attempt save and restore in text mode. This was prompted by PDF::TableX 
      t-tests using text save and restore, which isn't permitted by the PDF
      definition. Updated one PDF::Builder example that (unnecessarily) did a
      save/restore in text mode. Thanks to Vadim Repin for troubleshooting this
      and determining the problem and fix. While in here, make the warning 
      message that a request for 'Times' core font is changed to 'Times-Roman'
      a one-time (per run) output, rather than every time.

    lib/PDF/Builder/Page.pm, INFO/DEPRECATED, t/deprecations-page.t 
     Obsolete and deprecated methods get_mediabox(), get_cropbox(), 
      get_bleedbox(), get_trimbox(), and get_artbox() have been removed. Please
      use the regular methods (in $pdf or $page) with no arguments, to retrieve
      the current box values.

    lib/PDF/Builder/Resource/XObject/Image.pm, INFO/DEPRECATED
     Deprecate Image object methods width() and height() ability to SET the 
      width and height of an image. This setting apparently has never worked 
      properly, but in case someone is actually using it for some purpose, it 
      has not been immediately removed. It is planned to be removed after
      October, 2025, unless someone shows that they are using it.

    (most .pm files)
     Reformat POD to make navigation easier, including the listing of all user-
      accessible methods in a POD's Table of Contents at the top.

    lib/PDF/Builder/Content.pm, lib/PDF/Resource/XObject/Form/Hybrid.pm,
      lib/PDF/Builder/Lite.pm, INFO/DEPRECATED, examples/021_psfonts,
      t/content-deprecated.t, t/deprecations.t
     Remove long-deprecated method and global variable "lead". Use "leading" 
      instead, which is the correct typographical term. Although the "Lite" 
      subpackage isn't really maintained, "textlead()" has been replaced by 
      "textleading()".
    
    lib/PDF/Builder/Basic/PDF/Array.pm, /lib/PDF/Builder/Basic/PDF/Objind.pm, 
      INFO/DEPRECATED, t/deprecations.t
     Remove long-deprecated method "elementsof()" in favor of "elements()".
     Remove long-deprecated method "removeobj()" in favor of "remove_element()".

    README.md, Makefile.PL, META.yml, META.json, lib/PDF/Builder.pm, 
      examples/Column.pl
     Minimum Perl version changed from 5.24 to 5.26. Update list of expected
      end-of-service against various Perl versions.

    lib/PDF/Builder/Content.pm
     Clarify description of "bogen()" method's "larger" and "reverse" options.

    lib/PDF/Builder/Content.pm, lib/PDF/Builder/Content/Text.pm
     Implement 'align' option for text() left/center/right, l/c/r.

    README.md, examples/020_textunderline
     Add pointer to README to online documentation, and clarify underline 
      example (that first text is NOT underlined).

    lib/PDF/Builder.pm
     Clarify documentation on page_labels() versus pageLabel(), add code to
      check differences in starting page index and form of options, in response
      to PDF::API2 Issue #61.

    lib/PDF/Builder/Content/Text.pm
     A number of minor fixes: explicitly make paragraph <p> a block level, 
       any pending margin-bottom at the end of a column (if ran out of input) 
       should be accounted for in the returned $start_y.

    INFO/ACKNOWLEDGE.md (new), README.md, MANIFEST 
     Add acknowledgements and thanks.

    lib/PDF/Builder/Basic/PDF/Filter/LZWDecode.pm
     Revert an earlier change that broke some filtering.

    README.md  Update to point to new PDF::Builder Home Page structure (on 
      catskilltech.com).

    t/info.t
     Add test of modified() method.

    lib/PDF/Builder.pm
     Incorrect check on date format (missing last '). Reported by Johan Vromans
      against PDF::API2 #62. The _is_date() method has been updated to reflect
      a number of date/time formats found "in the wild", although the PDF
      documentation is a bit inconsistent over time, as well as ambiguous, so
      this may allow through some invalid formats.

    lib/PDF/Builder.pm, examples/050_pagelabels
     Fix an incompatibility with PDF::API2 recent changes (page_labels method).
      Now starts page index (for page_labels) at 1 instead of 0, and warns
      if 0 page index (page number) is given for page_labels (per API2 ticket
      #61). The old pageLabel method, kept for compatibility, is unaffected. 
      The example script has been updated to show both styles.

    lib/PDF/Builder/Content/Text.pm
     Make paragraph() method compatible with PDF::API2's, i.e., $continue
      parameter is optional. It should make no difference in calls to paragraph
      whether there is a fourth parameter (continue) before the options. This
      incompatibility showed up in PDF::TableX t-tests.

    lib/PDF/Builder/Docs.pm
     Full writeup of what's supported for markup input (Markdown, HTML).

    tools/3_examples.pl, examples/020_corefonts, examples/021_synfonts,
      examples/023_cjkfonts
     Add -s flag to run a small subset of the lengthy test list for three of
      the examples, plus overall when running all examples.

    lib/PDF/Builder/Page.pm, lib/PDF/Builder/Resource/CIDFont.pm
     Clean up some typos preventing synfont t-test from running.

    lib/PDF/Builder.pm, lib/PDF/Builder/Resource/CIDFont.pm
     It has come to our attention (#193) that PDF Readers (Adobe Reader and a 
      number of Third Party readers) do not properly handle the "Tw" operator 
      with TrueType fonts. Other font types work as expected. This operator, 
      set by the $text->wordspace(n) method, is ignored for TTF and OTF fonts
      ($pdf->ttfont()) because Tw works only for inputs in the stream where 
      words are separated by ASCII spaces (x20). TrueType fonts, on the other 
      hand, uses an input list of glyph IDs (4 digit hex numbers). Thus, there 
      are never any ASCII spaces to detect and adjust their widths. 

      We have updated the TTF/OTF handling code to honor the Tw operator value
      and emulate its actions, even though a native PDF Reader does not. In
      order to match the effects of the Tw operator on other font types, only
      ASCII spaces (x20) in the original text strings are affected, and not 
      other flavors of spaces. Finally, TextHS() and advancewidthHS() still do
      not handle charspace or wordspace settings (perhaps in the future).

    lib/PDF/Builder/Content/Text.pm
     When linking to a page via Markdown or HTML (URL #p-x-y), the default
      zoom was 1 (100%) when given just the x and y coordinates on a page. This
      has been changed to leave the zoom factor unchanged by default (unless,
      of course, you choose to specify a zoom amount). Also, the thickness
      (height) of the horizontal rule defaulted to 1pt, which was a bit heavy
      in appearance. It has been changed to default to 0.5pt.

    lib/PDF/Builder.pm
     GD image call was not working in some circumstances, due to image_gd()
      being called incorrectly. Reported and fixed by Hakon Hagland against
      PDF::API2 (#60).

    lib/PDF/Builder/Resource/Font/Postscript.pm, lib/PDF/Builder/Docs.pm,
      examples/021_psfonts, t/font-type1.t
     Update Type 1 font (PS font) handling to allow T1 fonts (.t1 filetype,
      variant of .afm/.pfm). Also some new font paths to search on. Per request 
      #194 from Red Hat packager (@ppisar).

    ===== IMPORTANT NOTICE =====
    lib/PDF/Builder.pm, lib/PDF/Builder/Docs.pm, 
      lib/PDF/Builder/Resource/Font/Postscript.pm
     Adobe has announced an end to support for Type 1 (Postscript/T1) fonts in 
      its products. The announcement wordings are a bit vague, sometimes 
      referring to "all products" and other times just to "authoring software".
      Presumably, Adobe PDF Readers (as well as Readers supplied by other 
      parties) will continue to display PDFs with Type 1 fonts for quite some 
      time, although this is by no means absolutely certain. Note that this 
      does NOT mean that PDF::Builder or other Third Party authoring tools may 
      not continue to support Type 1 fonts. This termination by Adobe of
      support of a now old and obsolete font format does not affect the use of 
      PDF::Builder for authoring PDFs, nor is it binding on other non-Adobe 
      readers and authoring tools. However, using Adobe products for editing of 
      PDFs with Type 1 fonts, and possibly of displaying them, may soon no 
      longer be possible. At any rate, users may want to consider starting to 
      move away from Type 1 font usage (psfont), and switch to TTF/OTF (ttfont)
      or even core fonts (corefont), as it is unknown how long Type 1 Reader 
      support will continue.
    ============================

3.025     2023-01-19

    ===== many thanks to Amtivo Group for sponsoring this work!
          see INFO/SPONSORS for more information
    lib/PDF/Builder/Content/Text.pm, examples/README, examples/examples_output,
      examples/Column.pl (new), MANIFEST, tools/3_examples.pl
     Add column() function to Content::Text, to support markup (none, Markdown,
      and HTML) in arbitrary columns. Note that PDF::Table will also support
      column(), but only when using PDF::Builder.

    lib/PDF/Builder.pm, lib/PDF/Builder/FontManager.pm (new), examples/README,
      examples/examples_output, examples/FontManager.pl (new), MANIFEST,
      tools/3_examples.pl
     Add a Font Manager to be able to select a font simply by giving the "face"
      and whether bold and/or italics are to be used. The actual font setting
      (with font size) is still done with $text->font($font, $size), but
      instead of having to explicitly create (or reuse) a $font, that part is
      all handled for you. It does not depend on any OS-provided font manager
      libraries (such as Linux provides, but Windows does not). Except for
      the core fonts, your application has to specify the base font and the
      files to use for italic, bold, etc.
    ===== end of sponsored work

    lib/PDF/Builder.pm, lib/PDF/Builder/FontManager.pm
     Update "font path" in Builder, make use of it in Font Manager. Note that
      at this time, only FontManager.pm makes use of the global font path
      settings (font_path() method). All other code, examples, and t tests 
      give full paths to font files. At some point in the future, this may be 
      changed, but the problem is that Linux and other non-Windows systems 
      seem to store their font files all over the place, and even Windows is 
      consistent only for TrueType files (it doesn't ship with any Type1 or 
      other format fonts). Note that if you wish to modify the default font
      path list, you need to edit Builder.pm.

    lib/PDF/Builder/Content.pm, examples/042_links, examples/HarfBuzz.pl, 
      examples/examples.output; MANIFEST, 040_annotation.pdf (new),
      examples/resources/HarfBuzz_example.pdf (removed) 
     Remove the output of HarfBuzz Shaper's example from examples/resources 
      (examples/resources/HarfBuzz_example.pdf), as this file is now available
      on the CTS website (Examples/PDF/Builder/HarfBuzz.pdf) and substitute a
      much smaller PDF, the output from 040_annotation, as the PDF sample for
      042_links. This will cut the package size of PDF::Builder by about half!
      References to HarfBuzz_example.pdf as a sample to look at (should you
      not be able to run HarfBuzz.pl due to HarfBuzz::Shaper not being 
      installed) have been updated to refer to the CTS website examples.

    README.md, LICENSE, lib/PDF/Builder.pm, examples/Column.pl
     Change copyright to 2023.

    META.json, META.yml
     Remove "provides" entries because 1) they do not seem to survive the
      packaging process, 2) no one seems to be able to state what this inform-
      ation is actually used for -- I see something vague about "search", and 
      3) how do I make "provides" entries that are better at doing whatever 
      they're supposed to do better than what CPAN does by default? Also, 
      there may be a META_ADD provides that I'm supposed to add to Makefile.PL, 
      but again, documentation is quite scarce. I think I'll just ignore the
      whole "provides" thing until there's good documentation on it. 

    README.md, Makefile.PL, META.json, META.yml, tools/optional_update.pl,
      t/00-all-usable.t, lib/PDF/Builder.pm, MANIFEST
     No longer automatically install Graphics::TIFF, Image::PNG::Libpng, and
      HarfBuzz::Shaper. This should lighten the installation and testing load
      on users, if they do not plan to use TIFF or PNG images, or do text
      shaping. Also list the new prerequisites for markup processing 
      (HTML::TreeBuilder, Text::Markdown). optional_update.pl no longer needed
      and has been removed from the distribution.

    xt/author-critic.t, xt/author-pod-syntax.t, MANIFEST, tools/2_t-tests.pl
     Move a couple of specialty t tests from t/ to xt/

    lib/PDF/Builder/Content/Hyphenate_basic.pm
     Add ability to split a word on Required Blanks (non-breaking spaces), as 
      a last-ditch way to do basic hyphenation. Add ability to split a word to
      fit a given width (regardless of where the split ends up), as an even
      more last-ditch way.

    lib/PDF/Builder.pm
     Per PDF::API2 change, allow 'Times' as an alias for core font 
      'Times-Roman'. This was also done for 'corefont()', as well as the
      original 'font()'. A warning is given if Times is used. Also, change
      'die' on errors to 'croak'.

    INFO/RoadMap, examples/020_corefonts
     Add discussion of /StructTreeRoot, remove Bank Gothic examples from
      core fonts (it appears to be just a partial alias for some other
      sans-serif font).

    LICENSE   remove superfluous "59" from FSF address in license. From
      PDF::API2 #59.

    lib/PDF/Builder.pm  open_page() clarify that default index is last page.

    lib/PDF/Builder/ViewerPreferences.pm
     Fix glitch in $pdf->viewer_preferences() for non-full-screen-page-mode.
      From PDF::API2 #50.

    lib/PDF/Builder.pm
     Fix page mode "SinglePage" unsupported. From PDF::API2 #49.

    lib/PDF/Builder/Page.pm
     Add documentation reminding users of rotation problems when using a
      crop box or other clipping. From PDF::API2 #58.

    lib/PDF/Builder.pm
     Add checks to page() method to see if the application is attempting to 
      add a new page number that is too negative (more than one before the
      existing first page) or too positive (beyond the existing last page). 
      The index value (page number) is clamped to be within possible values, 
      with a warning. Ref: #190.

    lib/PDF/Builder/Annotation-NamedDestination-Outline.pm,
      lib/PDF/Builder.pm, t/named-destinations.t, t/042_links
     Remove new PDF::API2-style location+args interfaces, as I don't like the
      way they work, and that they are not backwards compatible with the old
      methods. Unfortunately, this may break any application changed (or
      recently written) to use the new PDF::API2 2.043 interfaces. If the
      new location+args list notation were to be used, only if the number of
      args was even could this be detected. An odd number of args, plus the
      location string, would be indistinguishable from a hash list, one of 
      which may follow (as options) the location+args list. Ref: #190.

    lib/PDF/Builder/Resource/CIDFont/TrueType/FontFile.pm
     Typo fixed.

3.024     2022-09-12

    lib/PDF/Builder/Resource/CIDFont/TrueType/FontFile.pm
     "loca" table in TTF is optional, so to fix PDFAPI2#47, return from 
     subsetByCId() method early if no such table. According to PDFAPI2#37, it
     may be necessary to instruct ttfont() to NOT subset the font. Also, it
     appears that 'glyf' table may be missing in some fonts, so add check.
     Doesn't blow up any more, but problem #47 persists even with this fix.

    t/info.t (new), t/version.t (new), MANIFEST, tools/2_t-tests.pl
     New t-tests per PDF::API2.

    All "options" whose name begins with a dash (hyphen) "-" may now be given
     without a dash. E.g., "-translate => [30,25]" may now be given as
     "translate => [30,25]", or "'translate' => [30,25]". This is in keeping 
     with the new practices on PDF::API2. The old (dashed) names are still 
     valid, although they may be deprecated in the future.

    lib/PDF/Builder/Content.pm
     advancewidth() adds alias text_width(), per PDF::API2 changes.

    lib/PDF/Builder/Content.pm
     Fix problems in position() and textpos() methods reported by J Vromans,
      where the returned X coordinate was incorrect after being set twice.

    lib/PDF/Builder.pm
     New interfaces added for metadata query and set.

    INFO/RoadMap  Add thoughts on an Environments package

    lib/PDF/Builder.pm, INFO/KNOWN_INCOMPAT
     Various changes to keep compatibility with latest PDF::API2, although
      not all old methods are deprecated. Some methods are added, some are
      renamed (alternate names added), and some may have minor changes or
      extended functionality. See KNOWN_INCOMPAT for a description of these
      minor differences.

    lib/PDF/Builder.pm, lib/PDF/Builder/ViewerPreferences.pm (new), MANIFEST
     Per PDF::API2 change, split up function of $pdf->preferences into several
      easier-to-use methods: page_mode(), page_layout(), viewer_preferences(),
      open_action().

    lib/PDF/Builder/NamedDestination-Annotation.pm, t/named-destinations.t 
      (new), MANIFEST, tools/2_t-tests.pl, examples/042_links
     Minor cleanup plus locations may now be given without leading dashes.
      'link' is now alias for 'goto', 'file' is now alias for 'launch', 'url' 
      is now alias for 'uri', and 'pdf_file' and 'pdfile' are now aliases for 
      'pdf' method names.

    lib/PDF/Builder/Dict.pm
     Fix doubled $class (per PDF::API2 fix).

    INFO/old/.travis.yml.HOLD
     Remove per PDF::API2 removal of .travis.yml

    lib/PDF/Builder/Content.pm
     For linejoin()/line_join() and linecap()/line_cap(), allow alpha
      strings ("miter" or "m", etc.) in addition to numeric values (0, etc.).
      For PDF::API2 compatibility, many alternate method names exist now, such 
      as line_join() in addition to linejoin().

    lib/PDF/Builder/Resource/XObject/Form/BarCode.pm
     Some minor fixes to improve spacing between bars and labels when both 
      -lmzn and -fnsz are set and the font size is larger than -lmzn. Per
      PDF::API2 change. The barcode() convenience function has not been
      implemented.

    lib/PDF/Builder.pm, t/gif.t, t/jpg.t, t/png.t
     Add convenience image() method to simplify use of image_jpeg(), 
      image_tiff(), image_pnm(), image_png(), image_gif(), and image_gd().
      This is for PDF::API2 compatibility, and the original methods are
      unchanged.

    lib/PDF/Builder.pm, t/font-ttf.t, font-type1.t
     Add convenience font() method to combine corefont(), ttfont(), psfont(),
      and bdfont(). This is for PDF::API2 compatibility, and the original
      methods are unchanged. Font search path changes: add font_path() and
      set_font_path() for base search paths for fonts. Rename addFontDirs()
      to add_to_font_path() (keeping the old name around). Note that, unlike
      corefont(), font() requires the exact name of a standard core font.
      Kerning defaults to "on" when using font(), unlike other font methods.

    lib/PDF/Builder/Page.pm, lib/PDF/Builder.pm
     Deprecate unneeded update() method. Per PDF::API2 changes.

     Rename method end() to close(). close should be used for new work.

    lib/PDF/Builder.pm, t/deprecations.t, t/pdf.t, t/rt67767.t
     Rename method open_scalar() to from_string(). from_string() should be
      used for new work. This is for compatibility with PDF::API2 changes
      renaming open_scalar() to from_string(). Although open_scalar() should 
      still be supported for some time, it is possible that it may be 
      deprecated and removed in the future.

    lib/PDF/Builder.pm
     Permit the save(filename) method to be used as an alias for 
      saveas(filename). This is for compatibility with PDF::API2 changes 
      combining save() and saveas(). Note that this is NOT good interface
      design, to use 'save' for both purposes.

     pdf->stringify() renamed to pdf->to_string() (original still available).
      Also catch up on some new t-tests from API2.

    lib/PDF/Builder/Basic/PDF/File-Objind.pm  
     Per RT131657 PDF::API2 fix, Suppress recursion warnings while releasing 
      (destroying) PDF indirect objects, which can be highly-interconnected 
      (reported by Leon Winter).

    lib/PDF/Builder.pm
     Revise RT41971 fix per PDF::API2 change for outlines (no functional change)

    lib/PDF/Resource/Font/SynFont.pm   
     Code cleanup per PDF::API2. This includes a number of renamed options
      (old ones are still supported) and changed behavior for 'bold' if
      coming through alternate name synthetic_font(). Read the documentation
      for synfont/synthetic_font to ensure that you won't be tripped up by
      any changes, or differences between the two.

    lib/PDF/Builder.pm  per PDF::API2 fix, messages if fail to open input PDF

    CONTRIBUTING  minor update

    docs/buildDoc.pl  update to better handle non-PDF::Builder doc builds

    Makefile.PL, META.json, META.yml, README.md
     Perl 5.24 is the earliest supported version.

    README.md add manual build section

    t/tiff.t add exclude_version() function to exclude GhostScript or
      ImageMagick from all or selected uses, if your installed version
      falls with a range of excluded version numbers. This is to fix a problem
      where certain GhostScript versions were built with a bad library.
      Currently, the bad builds are believed to be limited to GhostScript 
      9.56.0 and 9.56.1. If you have this version, two of the tests in tiff.t
      (13 and 16, lzw+horizontal predictor, not converted to flate) will be
      skipped with "GhostScript not found".

    META.json, META.yml, MANIFEST add "provides" entry to make package
      sites happier.

    INFO/RoadMap add comments on PCF-format bitmapped fonts, and possible
      MathJax-based eqn support.

    INFO/LICENSE, MANIFEST 
      License moved up to top level, to make package sites happier.

    examples/HarfBuzz.pl, examples/resources/HarfBuzz_example.pdf
     Add 'fj' and 'ij' ligatures, although Times doesn't appear to include 
     them.

    examples/020_textrise add baselines and additional examples

    lib/PDF/Builder/Docs.pm, examples/HarfBuzz.pl
     Adobe Acrobat DC has changed its installed fonts location, so several
      non-Latin entries had to be updated.

    lib/PDF/Builder/Resource/CIDFont.pm
     Per PDF::API2 code style changes and uninitialized variable fix.

    INFO/Changes_2021, MANIFEST, README.md, lib/PDF/Builder.pm, INFO/LICENSE
     2022 copyright.

    lib/PDF/Builder/Annotation.pm, t/annotate.t, examples/040_annotation, 
      examples/041_annot_fileattach, examples/042_links
     Annotations revert to "no border" [#176] to match up with PDF::API2 
      behavior.

    lib/PDF/Builder.pm  per #171, allow blank or prefix-only page label (on 
     Reader's thumb slider) with -style => 'nocounter'.

    lib/PDF/Builder/Basic/PDF/File.pm
     Per RT 136648, PDF::API2 fix when writing xref streams. Note that while
      there is no longer an error message (fixed some time ago in PDF::Builder),
      there is still some new material (an XRef stream) added at the end of 
      the PDF, at each save (for both PDF::API2 and PDF::Builder). Something
      still needs to be done about this, some time later.

    lib/PDF/Builder/Resource/XObject/Image/GD-GIF-JPEG-PNG-PNM-TIFF.pm
     Add -name option to name the image object if desired.
      In sync with PDF::API2, add -compress option for PNM. 

    lib/PDF/Builder/Resource/XObject/Image/GIF-PNM.pm minor changes to sync
      with PDF::API2 changes.

    examples/HarfBuzz.pl, examples/resources/HarfBuzz_example.pdf
     show a better Chinese (CJK) example in vertical mode, which demonstrates 
      rotation of punctuation such as ( ). Continuation of #144.

    INFO/RoadMap  comments on page labeling (slider thumb) enhancements per 
      #171, including possibly integrating with header() and footer() calls
      that place a page number on the paper, and any outline/bookmarks, so
      that they all give a consistent page label (number).

    optional_update.pl, MANIFEST, README.md 
     optional_update moved to tools/, otherwise it
      was being placed in the PDF/ directory by the installer. Note that you 
      should be in your PDF::Builder root (parent of tools/) and run
      tools/optional_update.pl.
