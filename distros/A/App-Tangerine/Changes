0.22 2015-06-23

- Revert the previous change.  We don't want to list
  pragmas at the end.  Inline:: grouping needs to be handled
  differently, preferrably in Tangerine itself.

0.21 2015-06-23

- Don't convert module and file names to lowercase before sorting
  them.  There's no reason for it and it messes Inline::* groups.

0.20 2015-05-15

- Added [GithubMeta] to dist.ini, so the repo will be listed in the
  dist metadata, and also [MetaJSON], so the release will include a
  META.json file.
