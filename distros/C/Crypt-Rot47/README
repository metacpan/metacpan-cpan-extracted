Crypt::Rot47 version 0.06
================================

This module applies the ROT47 substitution cipher to ASCII text, thereby scrambling
it and making it difficult for others to read. Applying the same ROT47 substitution
cipher on the scrambled text will then restore the original text.

The ROT47 substitution cipher is a very simple form of encryption that works simply by
rotating the ASCII characters from '!" to '~' by 47 positions (hence its name). Therefore,
spaces in the plain text remain unchanged, but other characters are replaced with their
rotated equivalents.

For example, a 'B' (ASCII 66) becomes a 'q' (ASCII 113) because 66 + 47 = 113. When the
sum exceeds ASCII 126 ('~'), it simply wraps around starting at ASCII 33 ('!').

Because there are 94 characters between '!' and '~' in the ASCII table, rotating them
twice by 47 places has no net effect. Therefore, encryption and decryption are identical
operations with ROT47.
