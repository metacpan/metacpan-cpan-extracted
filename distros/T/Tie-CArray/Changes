Revision history for Perl extension Tie::CArray

0.15  2010-02-22
	- fix #54864 Fails on systems with nvsize > 8 (-Duselongdouble)
          exchanged double with NVTYPE, int by IVTYPE
        - PAGESIZE => MY_PAGESIZE use our own
        - require from 5.005005 to 5.006. 5.005 fails with 
          undefined IVTYPE, NVTYPE and a simple workaround didn't work
0.14  2008-01-20 11:56
	- fix 64int warnings
0.13  2008-01-15 20:00
	- fixed wrong tests 
0.12  2000-01-11 06:22
	- added SLICE
	- finally fixed eof problems strict unix c compilers
	  (in 0.11 RCS put \r\n in again, sorry)
        - under the Tie namespace (CArray -> Tie::CArray)
	- added wantarray to functions which could return arrays
	- fixed return of arrayrefs
        - started with structured pack-style templates as in Tie::MmapArray
	- changed test scripts
0.11  2000-01-02 02:29
	- added CArray.def to help cc/gcc
	- fixed eof problems and c comments for strict unix c compilers
	  (not really: RCS put \r\n in again, sorry)
        - added XS_rcs_string, XS_compile_date
        - added list() and init()
	- changed SeqArrays to return arrayrefs instead of arrays (faster),
          fast xs wantarray pending
0.10  06:31 05.12.99
        - complete rewrite: no Ptr/Array seperation anymore,
          the XS array contains the size info (as a pascal string)
	- 7 times faster for arrays, 24 times faster for seq. arrays.
	- renamed size() to len()
	- added easier array resize: internal ->freelen field,
	  grow() and delete() methods, itemsize variable and read-only method
	- fixed nreverse()
	- still problematic DESTROY with DEBUGGING perl
	- CStringArray's might be broken.
	  no fails with t/02strarr.t but some with test.pl. strange.
0.09  Tue Nov 30 21:45:09 1999
        - removed Exporter
	- fixed some bugs in ->ToInt3, ToInt4
	  changed argument order in ->ToDouble2, ToDouble3
        - fixed looping bug in all conversions: last element was not copied.
	- Type coercion for the arrays was fixed as for the CPtrs quite okay.
	  Any numeric value is accepted and converted on set()
	- fixed a bug in CDoublePtr::new with the RvAV assignment
	  (arrayrefs as ints instead of doubles)
	  t/02dblptr.t: 7 passes now
	- changed CSeqBase class hierarchy
	- nreverse still buggy, tie not tested, some errors in CSeqBase classes.
0.08  01:51 28.11.99
        - added nreverse for IntPtr and DoublePtr
        - new Int2 Int3 Int4 Double2 Double3 Ptr classes
  	  and converters (for Geometry::Points, ...)
	- changed classnames to full CArray::xxxPtr
        - rewrote the importer
	- removed SvROK_off from DESTROY, less crashes.
	  (only in DEBUG Perl, but this seems to be unrelated)
	- added some t/ harness tests
	- renamed *.txt to *.readme
0.07  05:23 26.11.99
	- added SvROK_off to DESTROY
	- CPtr::DESTROY crashes Perl_sysfree in DEBUG PERL
0.06  Sun Nov 22 1999
	- changed CintPtr to CIntPtr, ...
        - optional AV* initializer for CIntPtr and CStringPtr
        - fixed  OO methods
        - changed CArray::C**Array to C**Array
        - added convenient import tags
        - CIntPtr->new() not supported
        - added get_grouped_by(), isort(), and the CArray::CPtr base class
        - test 15 fails: import tags. seems to be too lazy. ignore it.
        - TIEARRAY not tested yet
0.05  Sat Nov 20 1999
	- changed intPtr to CintPtr, ...
        - compiles fine,
          raw function syntax (type::new) works but $obj = new type not.
        - optional AV* initializer for CDoublePtr only
0.04  Thu Nov 18 16:21:48 1999
	- re-created from scratch by h2xs 1.19
        - renamed from Geometry::CArray to CArray
        - decided between CArray::CDoublePtr (raw) and
          CArray::CDoubleArray (checked and tieable) objects
      16:53 20.11.99
        - fixed XS, PM, typemap
0.03  13:26 18.11.99
        - renamed from Geometry::Arrays to Geometry::CArray
          TIEARRAY and range checked classes
0.02  17.11.99 14:34
	- fixed test (dangling indices), added array_isort,
0.01  Mon Nov 16 15:57:36 1999
	- original version Geometry::Arrays for Geometry::Delaunay
