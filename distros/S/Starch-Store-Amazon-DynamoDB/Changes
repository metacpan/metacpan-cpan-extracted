0.07 2019-03-02T17:57:49Z

 - Declare deps as modules, not distros.
 - Remove Carp dependency.

0.06 2019-02-20T18:48:27Z

0.05 2019-02-18T05:58:28Z

 - Remove reaping, the way Amazon::DynamoDB does table scans does not
   account for provisioned read units and will always go over the limit.

 - Migrate all the tests from Test::More to Test2::V0.

0.04 2015-07-27

 - Properly extend the BUILD method.

0.03 2015-07-22

   LWP stuff which dramatically slows down the first DDB call.

 - Better Carp caller reporting.
 - Fix Type::Tiny union constraints sometimes failing on Perl < 5.14.
