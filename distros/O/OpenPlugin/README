README: OpenPlugin
=======================

OpenPlugin is a Plugin manager for web applications.

There are many web application frameworks out there, and each seems to have
it's own method of handling sessions, user authentication, datasource
management, logging, etc.  OpenPlugin's goal is to make one unified system,
capable of handling those needs for all web application frameworks.  OpenPlugin
offers an interface, plugin, and drivers for each plugin -- you get to choose
what plugins you want loaded, and the exact driver for how that plugin will
function.

For example, OpenPlugin provides an API for logging.  But OpenPlugin doesn't
choose where it logs, thats up to you and your application.  You can have it
log to a file, STDERR, Syslog, or anything you want.  If the driver you want
doesn't exist, simply create one!

The following is a list of the current plugins with their drivers:
