NAME

    Dist::Zilla::App::Command::update - A Dist::Zilla (and hence
    Dist::Milla) command to update generated files

SYNOPSIS

        $ dzil update [--trial]
        $ milla update    # my use case

DESCRIPTION

    This command is approximated by

        $ dzil build --no-tgz [--trial]
        $ rm -rf Your-Package-x.yz/

    but it builds inside a temporary directory. If you've ever used dzil
    build && dzil clean to update generated files, now you can use dzil
    update. That's all!

OPTIONS

 --trial

    Build a trial release, as if dzil build was called with --trial.
