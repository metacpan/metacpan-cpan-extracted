1.00  Wed Nov 18 22:00:00 2009
- API changed.
  Placeholder escapes are a very bad idea.
  Now the first step is the translation.
  During the translation placeholders (maketext/gettext) are expanded.
  The second step is the escaping of the translated string.
  Then the formatter should run.
  At least expand the unescaped placeholders.
