NAME
    Dancer::Template::Tenjin - Tenjin wrapper for Dancer

VERSION
    version 0.5

SYNOPSIS
            # in your config.yml
            template: "tenjin"

            # note: templates must use the '.tt' extension

            # you might also want to add (if your templates are UTF-8, which is the
            # default encoding used by Tenjin):
            charset: "UTF-8"

DESCRIPTION
    This class is an interface between Dancer's template engine abstraction
    layer and the Tenjin module.

    Tenjin is a fast and feature-full templating engine that can be used by
    Dancer for production purposes. In comparison to Template::Toolkit, it
    is much more lightweight, has almost no dependencies, and supports
    embedded Perl code instead of defining its own language.

    In order to use this engine, you need to set your webapp's template
    engine in your app's configuration file (config.yml) like so:

            template: "tenjin"

    You can also directly set it in your app code with the set keyword.

    Now you can create Tenjin templates normally, but note that due to a
    Dancer restriction your template files must end in the '.tt' extension
    as Dancer automatically adds this extension to the template names you
    declare in your apps.

METHODS
  init()
    Initializes a template engine by generating a new instance of Tenjin.

  render( $template, $tokens )
    Receives a template name and a hash-ref of key-value pairs to pass to
    the template, and returns the template rendered by Tenjin.
