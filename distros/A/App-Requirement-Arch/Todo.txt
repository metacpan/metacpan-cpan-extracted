# This is Todo.txt #
#------------------#

use Text::Aspell, seems that the implementation to find errors in the file name is broken
	get user dictionary from ~/.ra
	
requirements are expected to have a .txt extension
	change to .rat allowing it to be associated with ra_edit

merge check_requirement_violation and chek_requirement_contents

allow a requirement template that is free form but checked with the perl requirement tempalte
	allow free form template perl user/project

all the scripts options are taken from a single file to allow project wide setting
	cli overrides projects settings
	
RELEASE
	dependencies
	list all files in manifest
	all sub documentation
	document the script and put the right =head fields in them

remove NO_CATEGORIES from the flat requirement document

split load_and_filter_requirements

explain why this module


add output section in the application documentation

master template and master categories when requirements come from different project
	shall we merge or verify each requirement to its own masters?

show  all the files (and structure) needed to run the applications

can we have commands that can be  piped into each other?

	ra select r1 | ra select directory/  | ra check --templates | ra check --script | ra filter- something | ra merge | ra filter- something | ra show --dhtml
	
	can we keep a server instance up to avoid reloading or re-evalauating requirements?
		we could also implement the pipes ourselves
	
	
ra check should keep a cache of checked requirements (passed and fail) and simply handle the requirement name out

does ra merge have to 'merge'?
	can't it create a parralel data structure to  be merged when necessary only?
	
ra filter can be used on the unmerged requirements and on the merged requirements
	since the filters that are used are most probably the same from a run to another, the filtering result
	can be cached

can the ra_show_* scripts use the same base functionality more and can they be
	called through the ra_show command + arguments
	
asciio diagram can't be loaded in latest asciio

gtk based UI for requirement creation and manipulation

better handling of fit criteria
	list not string
	link to real tests
	use for traceability to tests
		may impact test granularity
	
way of working
	define 
		a project vision
		categories
		term definition
			
links to oos project and other tools

Arch.pm should implement the front end to the commands which should be defined in App::R::A::Commands::*

merge the todo files!
