Revision history for Dist-Zilla-Plugin-ChangelogFromGit-Debian

0.10 Nov 20 2014
    - Add allow_empty_head option to allow HEAD versions with no changes
      to be entered into the changelog. This is a selfish feature that I
      need for something I'm doing. Yay me!

0.07 Feb 8 2012
    - Add maintainer email and name as Debian doesn't like multiple folks
      being attributed. This should clean up a lot of warnings in debuild's
      processing of changelogs. Defaults to CPAN Author <cpan@example.org>

0.06 Jan 17 2012
    - Add leading asterisk to change lines and indent additional lines past
      the first-lines asterisk. Refs IIOSS-26

0.05 Dec 29 2011
    - Default package name to lc($self->zilla->name) to match other plugins

0.04 Nov 14 2011
    - Use @GPHAT plugin bundle for dzil
    - Add dist_name config option
