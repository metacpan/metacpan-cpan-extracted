DESCRIPTION
    The methods in the "Test::STD:Scrub" package are designed to support the
    "Test::STDmaker" and the "ExtUtils::SVDmaker" package. This is the focus
    and no other focus. Since "Test::STD::Scrub" is a separate package, the
    methods may be used elsewhere. They are used to wild card out parts of
    two documents before they are compared by making these snippets the
    same. In all likehood, any revisions will maintain backwards
    compatibility with previous revisions. However, support and the
    performance of the "Test::STDmaker" and "ExtUtils::SVDmaker" packages
    has priority over backwards compatibility.

  scrub_architect

     $scrubbed_text = Test::STD::Scrub->scrub_architect($script_text)

    When comparing the contents of two Perl program modules, the architect
    should not be used in the comparision. The "scrub_architect" method will
    replace the architect with a generic value. Applying the
    "scrub_architect" to the contents of both files before the comparision
    will eliminate the date and version as factors in the comparision.

  scrub_date_ticket

     $scrubbed_text = Test::STD::Scrub->scrub_date_ticket($script_text)

    When comparing the contents of email messages, the date and email ticket
    should not be used in the comparision. The "scrub_date_ticket" method
    will replace the date and email ticket with a generic value. Applying
    the "scrub_date_ticket" to the contents of both files before the
    comparision will eliminate the data and ticket as factors in the
    comparision.

  scrub_date_version

     $scrubbed_text = Test::STD::Scrub->scrub_date_version($script_text)

    When comparing the contents of two Perl program modules, the date and
    version should not be used in the comparision. The *scrub_date_versiont*
    method will replace the date and version with a generic value. Applying
    the "scrub_date_version" to the contents of both files before the
    comparision will eliminate the date and version as factors in the
    comparision.

  scrub_file_line

     $scrubbed_text = Test::STD::Scrub->scrub_file_line($script_text)

    When comparing the ouput of *Test* module the file and line number
    should not be used in the comparision. The "scrub_file_line" method will
    replace the file and line with a generic value. The subroutine changes
    any double quotes around numbers to single quotes. Applying the
    "scrub_file_line" to the contents of both files before the comparision
    will eliminate the file and line as factors in the comparision.

  scrub_test_file

     $scrubbed_text = Test::STD::Scrub->scrub_test_file($script_text)

    When comparing the ouput of *Test:Harness* module the test file should
    not be used in the comparision. The "scrub_test_file" method will
    replace the test file with a generic value. Applying the
    "scrub_test_file" to the contents of both files before the comparision
    will eliminate the test file as a factor in the comparision.

QUALITY ASSURANCE
    Running the test script "Scrub.t" verifies the requirements for this
    module. The "tmake.pl" cover script for Test::STDmaker automatically
    generated the "Scrub.t" test script, "Scrub.d" demo script, and
    "t::Text::Scrub" program module POD, from the "t::Text::Scrub" program
    module contents. The "tmake.pl" cover script automatically ran the
    "Scrub.d" demo script and inserted the results into the 'DEMONSTRATION'
    section above. The "t::Text::Scrub" program module is in the
    distribution file Text-Scrub-$VERSION.tar.gz.

1.0 SCOPE
    This paragraph identifies and provides an overview of the released
    files.

  1.1 Identification

    This release, identified in 3.2, is a collection of Perl modules that
    extend the capabilities of the Perl language.

  1.2 System overview

    The "Text::Scrub" module extends the Perl language (the system).

    When comparing text there are small snippets such as version numbers and
    dates that should be wild carded out and not influence the comparisions.
    The Test::STD:Scrub module replaces these small snippets with invariant
    snippet. By replacing the same part of each file with the same invariant
    snippet, those small sections of text are effectively wild carded for
    the comparisions.

    When performing tests, the ability to wild card small snippets of text
    is vital in making accurate comparison. The same capability is also
    essential for version control in comparing two pieces of software to see
    if there are significant changes.

  1.3 Document overview.

    This document releases Text::Scrub version 0.08 providing a description
    of the inventory, installation instructions and other information
    necessary to utilize and track this release.

  3.3 Changes

    The changes are as follows:

    Test-STD-Scrub-0.01
        Rename Module
            At 02:44 AM 6/14/2003 +0200, Max Maischein wrote: A second thing
            that I would like you to reconsider is the naming of
            "Test::TestUtil" respectively "Test::Tech" - neither of those is
            descriptive of what the routines actually do or what the module
            implements. I would recommend renaming them to something closer
            to your other modules, maybe "Test::SVDMaker::Util" and
            "Test::SVDMaker::Tech", as some routines do not seem to be
            specific to the Test::-suite but rather general
            (format_array_table). Some parts (the "scrub" routines) might
            even better live in another module namespace,
            "Test::Util::ScrubData" or something like that.

            Broke away the "scrub" routines from Test::TestUtil created this
            module Test::STD::Scrub.

        new methods
            Added the scrub_data and scrub_probe methods

    Test-STD-Scrub-0.02
        Use the new modules from the break-up of the "File::FileUtil" module

    Text-Scrub-0.01
        Moved to a more appropriate library location.

    Text-Scrub-0.02
        Change the test so that test support program modules resides in
        distribution directory tlib directory instead of the lib directory.
        Because they are no longer in the lib directory, test support files
        will not be installed as a pre-condition for the test of this
        module. The test of this module will precede immediately. The test
        support files in the tlib directory will vanish after the
        installtion.

    Text-Scrub-0.03
        Recreate distribution file with Archive::TarGzip 0.02 that uses mode
        777 for directories instead of 666. Started to get emails from Unix
        installers about untar not being able to change to a directory with
        mode of 666.

    Text-Scrub-0.04
        Changes the 'stringify' module for 'Test-Tech' from 'Data::Strify'
        to 'Data::Secs2'.

    Text-Scrub-0.05
        The lastest build of Test::STDmaker expects the test library in the
        same directory as the test script. Coordiated with the lastest
        Test::STDmaker by moving the test library from tlib to t/Text, the
        same directory as the test script and deleting the test library
