=head1 NAME

Bio::RNA::Treekin - Classes for working with I<Treekin> output.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Bio::RNA::Treekin;

    # Read multi-record file (records separated by single '&')
    my $treekin_records = Bio::RNA::Treekin::MultiRecord->new($treekin_file);

    # Iterate over single records.
    while (defined (my $next_treekin_record = $treekin_records->next)) {
        # Print current file name.
        print 'Treekin simulation for ', $next_treekin_record->rates_file, " \n";

        # Print population of minimum 42 at the end of the simulation
        my  $init_pop = $current_treekin_record->init_population;
        my $final_pop = $current_treekin_record->final_population;
        print 'min 42: ', $init_pop->of_min(42), ' => ',
              $final_pop->of_min(42), "\n";
    }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides auxiliary classes to parse, query and print the data
generated by the reaction kinetics simulation tool I<Treekin>, as well as
multi-landscape simulations as generated by I<BarMap>.

Both I<Treekin> and I<BarMap> are being developed by the Theoretical
Biochemistry Group (TBI) of the University of Vienna. Note that this
package is I<not> developed or supported by the authors of I<Treekin> and
I<BarMap>.

=head1 CLASSES

To process a regular output file of I<Treekin>, use a record object as
provided by L<Bio::RNA::Treekin::Record>. When working with multi-record files
as produced by I<BarMap>, use a record stream from
L<Bio::RNA::Treekin::MultiRecord> to retrieve the individual simulation
records.

Each I<Treekin> record comprises, beside meta-information, a time series of
populations of each minimum. These data are stored as objects of type
C<Bio::RNA::Treekin::PopulationDataRecord>.

Please refer to the documenation of the individual classes for more
information.
