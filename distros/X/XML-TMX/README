XML::TMX
========

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

Note that some installed scripts require modules that are not required
for XML::TMX installation. This gives you the possibility to install
quickly XML::TMX for your use, but probably installs some commands
that will not work out-of-the-box.
