1.18 - 2007-11-24
	* Cleanups for the move from CVS to SVN
	* No need to upgrade

1.17 - 2007-03-18

	* fixed man page destination for linktractor

1.14 - 2007-01-02
	* Added a command line tool, linktractor, to extract the links
	from the input files, stdin, or a file of the net.
	* Updated license info. Use this under the terms of Perl itself.
	* Happy New Year!

1.13 - 2006-05-27
	* Added functions to add tags and attributes to the list that
	the module will parse. You don't have to fool with the internal
	hash or email me to make changes anymore!
	* Unless you want this feature, you don't need to upgrade.

1.12 - 2006-01-11
	* rt.cpan.org: Ticket #16942: A bug in my URL resolution code
	only resolved the last URL found in a tag. Now the code goes through
	all the value and resolves each that it thinks should be a URL
	* Everyone should upgrade

1.11 - 2005-08-22
	* added support for iframe src extraction
	* no need to upgrade unless you need this feature

1.10 - 2005-08-16
	* added a clear_links() method so you can start fresh if you
	want to parse multiple files with the same parser object. This
	does not affect previous behavior, so old scripts should be
	safe.

	* Added POD coverage tests, fixed issues
	* No code changes: no need to upgrade

1.08 - 2004-09-07
