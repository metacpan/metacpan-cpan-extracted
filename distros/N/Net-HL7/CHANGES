Change history
--------------

0.81:
* Change in the licence. The Beer-ware license was considered non-free by the
  Fedora legal department, given that it would require you to give is beer in 
  some situations. So now we just stringly encourage you to do so...

0.80:
* POD fixes

0.79:
* Added IO::Socket::Timeout to requirements

0.78:
* Added timeout to daemon connection, so as to close connections on badly
  behaved clients

0.77:
* Fixed Segment->getFieldAsString so as to properly return values that
  Perl considers 'not true'.

0.76:
* Added getFieldAsString method to Segment
* Added tests for above
* Made getSegmentAsString use getFieldAsString 

version 0.75:

* Fixed regex describing segment name in Message.pm for compatibility
  with all segment names.

version 0.74:
* Fixed documentation issue (again, hinted by Brent B. Powers)
* Added removeSegmentByName method (added by Sebastian John)
* Fix for regex describing segment name in Message.pm, hinted by Brent B.Powers

version 0.73:
* Fixed issue 1035505 with proposed patch of Brent B. Powers
* Fixed issue 1034857
* Fixed issue 1033989 with proposed patch of Brent B. Powers

version 0.72:
* Fixed broken Message.pm: new message from string with subcomponents
  didn't produce a correct string with toString. Thanx to Jason Aragorn 
  Tobias Lunn <jlunn@coderyte.com> of CodeRyte, Inc..
* Added untaint in Message, so that no errors are produced when using
  the tainted mode (like the hl7d does) 
* Added getSegmentAsString and getSegmentFieldAsString methods to Message, 
  after a proposal by H.Emery Ford (emery_ford@bigfoot.com).

version 0.71:
* Fixed broken MANIFEST: added lib/Net/HL7.pm

version 0.70:
* Full redesign of internal structure of the Message and Segment
  classes. Changes have been made to the toString method of the
  Message, and to the constructor when providing a string representation
  of a HL7 message.
* Added the possibility of passing an array of field values to the
  constructor of the Segment.
* Removed automatic creation of a MSH segment when creating an HL7 
  message.
* Added better (sub)composed fields support on Segment getField method.
* Added the Net::HL7 module, to provide a version number of the whole 
  package to Perl 'things' requiring a specific version, and as a container
  for global HL7 properties, like control characters.
* Refactored tests to use Test::More after mysterious failing of
  existing tests under Perl 5.8.2, due to a change in the implementation
  of the 'eq' operator regarding 'undefined' (?).

version 0.68:
* Added more documentation (this is an ongoing effort...)
* made setField on segment accept multiple values. These are joined with
  the component separator.
* Added the HL7 NULL variable for the setField operation on a segment.
* Fixes in MSH segment due to some reference interference quirks on 
  Solaris.
* Added size method to Segment
* Made ACK message type copy full MSH when initialized with message, then
  set it's own specific fields.
* Fixed some complaints when running in strict mode on uninitialized values.
* Fixed some tests that used undefined values.

version 0.67:
* Added COMPONENT_SEPARATOR, REPETITION_SEPARATOR, ESCAPE_CHARACTER and
  SUBCOMPONENT_SEPARATOR to the MSH segment. The setField method on this
  segment, on index 2 now actually changes the values of these variables.
  Also checks on setting field 1 on MSH, whether input is just 1 char.
* Fixes on ACK, to set the error message.  
* Check on segment id: it must be exactely three characters long, upper 
  case.
* Fixed Makefile.PL, so it now really installs into the Perl lib path.
* Added more methods to the Message to manipulate segments.

version 0.66:
* Implemented the getNextRequest method to actually read new data. The
  getRequest method only reads data from the socket if there's no request
  cached.

version 0.65:
* the getRequest method of the Net::HL7::Daemon::Client has been enabled for
  multiple incoming messages. This means that the getRequest method now tries
  to read from the socket every time it is called.
* Fixed some documentation

version 0.64:
* Fixed error in daemon and ack tests
* Fixed erroneous setting of MSH fields in Message.pm
* set MSH(11) to P and MSH(15) to AL per default
* Made new() method of Message also split message string on \n
* ACK now takes MSH(11) and MSH(12) from incoming MSH, and sets MSH(15) and MSH(16)
  to the empty string.
* Fixed erroneous sendAck and sendNack methods. The stuff is now sent as a single 
  line, to prevent perl from inserting separators, like end of lines, etc.

version 0.63:
* fixed some POD errors
* added the sendResponse method to Net::HL7::Daemon::Client
* Removed NACK module: it doesn't exists in the HL7 world.
* The MSH segment now uses index 1 of it's fields for the FIELD_SEPARATOR value;
  other fields have moved one to the right
* added setAckCode method to ACK, to be able to set the error for the acknowledgement.

version 0.62:
* Fixed erroneous read of input buffer for Client
* Added ACK, NACK messages
* Added MSH segment
* getSegmentByName is removed
* Made the Daemon and the Client inherit from IO::Socket, so you can more 
  easy do things with forking and other server operations you would 
  perform on sockets.
* Made several constructors set segments and values, like auto-adding the
  MSH segment to every instance of Message.

version 0.61:
* Moved the stuff to a new namespace (Net::HL7)
* Created a Daemon, resembling the HTTP::Daemon
* Created the Request and Response classes
* added tests

version 0.5:
* Added the getField method to HL7::Message
* repaired broken message parse for HL7::Message constructor

version 0.4:
* Removed spurious newline between segments.
