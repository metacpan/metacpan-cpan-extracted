0.022 17 Feb 2010

0.021 03 Feb 2010

 - move logic for can_write() check into edit.tt so that related values can
   be edited. This logic change is first supported in CatalystX::CRUD 0.40.
 - fix authz check for m2m relationships to look at the m2m controller
   (map_class_controller) rather than the foreign class controller.

   (https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=45631)

0.017 16 April 2009
 - fix bug with missing 'Export as Excel' link when in View mode
 - change to extjs grey style css
 - add support for sort_prefix() in RHxFR::Metadata. This allows for
   setting explicit sort prefix strings on column names and (in theory)
   allows for sorting on JOINed tables as with m2m and o2m and FK "virtual"
   columns.
 - fix bug when related FK is undef in Serializer
 - enable Create and Reassign links without having to go to edit mode	  
 - fix Excel view and list.xls.tt to work (finally!) with
   LiveGrid+Serializer

   mode (reduce confusion particularly for Delete button)

   relationship

   Then use it in autocomplete_field.tt
 - tweeks to results livegrid size
 - textarea fields use <pre>+autowrap+htmlescape unless they have HTML
   markup in them.
 - click on related_field_link always defaults to 'view' regardless of
   can_write. may be overridden with c.session.prefs.default_crud_action
 - add html_escape feature to Serializer

   together.
 - skip ManyToOne and OneToOne rels in filter_relationships.tt since we
   assume those are handled by related_field_link.tt

0.011 02 Dec 2008
 - revert crud.js to ignore m2m_url on livegrid row click. The feature
   needs more thought.
 - fix bug with limit != count so increased livegrid buffer size from 50 to

   for usability.

 - add unique_value() check in form related label even if foreign_field is
   undef
 - fix autocomplete_field to initialize the hidden input with the original
   internal_value

   o2m and m2m creation without leaving the current page. The number of
   fields controls whether it is enabled or not. See the LIVEGRID_FORM_SIZE
   setting in crud/tt_config.tt.
 - replace all 'datatable' instances with 'livegrid' in Serializer class.
 - PK value in Serializer comes from controller to allow app override of
   schema class.

   relationships view * stricter dom structure * yui_header.tt * split up
   some .tt into smaller chunks * RelOpts hash instead of separate
