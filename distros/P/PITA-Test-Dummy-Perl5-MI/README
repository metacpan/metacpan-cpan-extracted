NAME
    PITA::Test::Dummy::Perl5::MI - CPAN Test Dummy for testing
    Module::Install::With

SYNOPSIS
        use PITA::Test::Dummy::Perl5::MI;
    
        my $name = PITA::Test::Dummy::Perl5::MI->dummy;

DESCRIPTION
    This module is part of the Perl Image Testing Architecture (PITA) and
    acts as a test module for seeing if the environment-sensing functionaliy
    in Module::Install work as expected.

    As such, his Makefile.PL contains some non-standard instrumentation
    which outputs harmless human-readable testing data to STDOUT for later
    analysis outside of the installation.

    In addition, it shares the normal functionality of all CPAN Test
    Dummies.

    1. Contains no functionality, and will never do so.

    2. Has no non-core depencies, and will never have any.

    3. Exists on CPAN.

    Unlike the other Test Dummies, the versioning of Milton loosely matches
    that of the Module::Install version he was built with ("loosely" because
    sometimes he gets built with non-production versions of
    Module::Install).

METHODS
  dummy
    Returns the dummy's name, in this case 'Milton'

SUPPORT
    No support is available for Milton.

    His head is meant to come off ONLY when called as Makefile.PL :)
