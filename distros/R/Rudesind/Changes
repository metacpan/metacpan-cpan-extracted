- Make sure that Rudesing::Build loads Rudesing::Config in an eval, so
installation doesn't blow up before Path::Class and Config::Auto are
installed.  Reported by Barry Hoggard.

- Add missing prereq of File::Find::Rule, and make sure that
Rudesing::Build loads it with require, so installation doesn't blow up
before it can be detected as a prereq.  Reported by Barry Hoggard.

- Failed admin logins redirected to a non-existent URI.

- Move some functions around.

- Replaced the term "directory" with "gallery" throughout the code and
style sheet.
