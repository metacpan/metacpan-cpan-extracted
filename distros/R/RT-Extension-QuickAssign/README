NAME
    RT-Extension-QuickAssign - Add owner change links on ticket display page

DESCRIPTION
    For tickets that are currently unowned, this extension provides an
    "Assign..." menu under the Actions menu, allowing users with sufficient
    rights to quickly assign the owner to any of the possible owners for a
    ticket.

    Generating the list of potential owners for a ticket may have a
    performance impact for some installations.

RT VERSION
    Works with RT 4 and 5.0
