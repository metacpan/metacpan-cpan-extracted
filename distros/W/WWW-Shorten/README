NAME
    WWW::Shorten - Interface to URL shortening sites.

SYNOPSIS
      #!/usr/bin/env perl
      use strict;
      use warnings;

      use WWW::Shorten 'TinyURL'; # Recommended
      # use WWW::Shorten 'Bitly'; # or one of the others

      # Individual modules have have their own syntactic variations.
      # See the documentation for the particular module you intend to use for details

      my $url = 'https://metacpan.org/pod/WWW::Shorten';
      my $short_url = makeashorterlink($url);
      my $long_url  = makealongerlink($short_url);

      # - OR -
      # If you don't like the long function names:

      use WWW::Shorten 'TinyURL', ':short';
      my $short_url = short_link($url);
      my $long_url = long_link( $short_url );

DESCRIPTION
    A Perl interface to various services that shorten URLs. These sites
    maintain databases of long URLs, each of which has a unique identifier.

DEPRECATION NOTICE
    The following shorten services have been deprecated as the endpoints no
    longer exist or function:

    *   WWW::Shorten::LinkToolbot

    *   WWW::Shorten::Linkz

    *   WWW::Shorten::MakeAShorterLink

    *   WWW::Shorten::Metamark

    *   WWW::Shorten::TinyClick

    *   WWW::Shorten::Tinylink

    *   WWW::Shorten::Qurl

    *   WWW::Shorten::Qwer

    When version 3.100 is released, these deprecated services will not be
    part of the distribution.

SHORTEN APP
    A very simple program called shorten is supplied in the distribution's
    bin folder. This program takes a URL and gives you a shortened version
    of it.

BUGS, REQUESTS, COMMENTS
    Please submit any issues
    <https://github.com/p5-shorten/www-shorten/issues> you might have. We
    appreciate all help, suggestions, noted problems, and especially
    patches.

    * If you know of a shorten service that we don't already have, make your
    own service and release it as a separate module, like
    WWW::Shorten::Googl or WWW::Shorten::Bitly. Alternatively, you can let
    us know and we'll be happy to work it up for you.
