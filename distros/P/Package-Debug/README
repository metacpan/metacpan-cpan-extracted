NAME
    Package::Debug - Add ENV/Config controlled debug tokens to your code

VERSION
    version 0.2.2

SYNOPSIS
    There is a lot of code on "CPAN" that has something like this in it:

        our $DEBUG = $ENV{MY_PACKAGE_NAME_DEBUG};

    or something like

        sub DEBUG {
            return if not $ENV{MY_PACKAGE_NAME_DEBUG};
            <real debug code>
        }

    or something like:

        if( $ENV{MY_PACKAGE_NAME_DEBUG} ) {
            *DEBUG=sub{ withdebug }
        } else {
            *DEBUG=sub { noop }
        }

    These are mostly simple and straight forward, ... however, they
    artificially limit what you can do, at the cost of making ugly code.

    This module aims to implement the common utility, with less fuss:

        $ENV{MY_BAZ_DEBUG} = 1;

        package My::Baz;

        use Package::Debug;

        ...

        sub foo {
            DEBUG("message");
        }

    And all the right things should still occur.

    Additionally, this module will eventually add a bunch of features, that
    are by default off, but can be toggled on using environment or
    configuration files.

EXPECTED FEATURES
    *   Deferrable debug mechanism

        The defacto "DEBUG()" stub when not in a debug environment should be
        a no-op, or as close to a no-op as possible.

        However, when debugging is turned on, debugging back ends should
        also be controllable via env/configuaration, and proxy to things
        like Log::Message and friends.

    *   Per-package debug granularity

        Every package will get its own independent DEBUG key, and DEBUG for
        a class can be toggled with an %ENV key relevant to that class.

    *   Global Debugging

        In addition to package level granularity, global debugging can also
        be enabled, while still seeing the individual packages the debug
        message emanates from.
