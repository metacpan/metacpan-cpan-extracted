0.04    22 December 2012
        - Minor text/makefile updates.

0.03    13 July 2011
        - (Changelog update only: the comment for 0.02 states that
           Digest::SHA1 is core, but it is not. It being a dependency
           of Net::OAuth is still sufficient reason to use it instead
           of Digest::SHA, though.) 

0.02    12 July 2011
        - Incorporated patch from sthoenna@gmail.com to use Digest::SHA1,
          instead of Digest::SHA, since the former is core and is already a
          dependency of Net::OAuth.

0.01    17 January 2011
        - Initial release.
