1.12  2013-09-03 13:00:00 EST

 WARNING BACK COMPAT BREAKAGE FOLLOWS

 Removed The YAML and HTML parser from the distro.  You
 should install these if you actually use them.  They are listed as
 optional dependencies going forward.

 This is possibly a breaking change, but necessary for security and
 considered acceptable since those formats have not generally
 become preferred for web services.

 In addition, the default de/serialization mappings for HTML and YAML
 have been removed.  You can add that back by adding the following to
 you Configuration for the subclass of Catalyst::Controller::REST -

    package Foo::Controller::Bar;

    use Moose;
    use namespace::autoclean;

    BEGIN { extends 'Catalyst::Controller::REST' }
    __PACKAGE__->config(
      'map' => {
        'text/html'          => 'YAML::HTML',
        'text/x-yaml'        => 'YAML',
      },
    );

 You should do this if you are using these de/serialization formats.

1.11  2013-06-16 15:23:03 BST

 - Fix infinite recursion in tests under Catalyst 5.90040

1.10  2013-04-22 14:36:53 BST

 - Use YAML rather than JSON in basic tests

1.09  2013-04-19 13:34:38 BST

 - Don't load Data::Serializer unnecessarily in tests

1.08  2013-04-16 08:33:00 BST

 - Factor Data::Serializable into it's own dist to stop breakages.

     If you use any of:

     * Data::Dumper
     * Data::Denter
     * Data::Taxi
     * Config::General
     * PHP::Serialization

     You'll need to install Catalyst-Action-Serialize-Data-Serializer and add the
     appropriate lines to your controller config.  Said lines may be:

         'text/x-data-dumper' => [ 'Data::Serializer', 'Data::Dumper' ],
         'text/x-data-denter' => [ 'Data::Serializer', 'Data::Denter' ],
         'text/x-data-taxi'   => [ 'Data::Serializer', 'Data::Taxi'   ],
         'text/x-config-general'    => [ 'Data::Serializer', 'Config::General' ],
         'text/x-php-serialization' => [ 'Data::Serializer', 'PHP::Serialization' ],

1.07  2013-04-11 20:20:00 BST

 - Don't serialize if a view is explicitly set.

  - If the controller sets the view in $c->stash->{current_view} or
    $c->stash->{current_view_instance}, then it is explicitly requesting a
    certain kind of serialization and C::A::Serialize shouldn't override
    that.

 - Remove Storable and FreezeThaw from the list
   of serialization methods offered by default, and
   from the docs - they're totally unsafe :/

1.06  2012-12-11 22:04:00 UTC

 - Sort list of allowed methods. RT#81825

1.05  2012-07-02 20:13:00 BST

 - Bugfix get_allowed_methods list:
    - include HEAD
    - remove "not_implemented"

1.04  2012-06-30 10:25:00 BST

 - Bugfix to _dispatch_rest_method

1.03  2012-06-28 00:40:00 BST

 - Expose _get_allowed_methods to the API (wreis)

 - Fix default OPTIONS handler: As the ->body is defined, then serialization
   won't happen and we don't get wrong responses. (wreis)

 - Add default HEAD handler: auto dispatches to _GET method if it exists (wreis)

1.02  2012-06-05 22:23:00 BST

 - Fix forwarded REST methods, e.g. foo_GET to be more
   correctly displayed as a forward in the stats info.

 - Make public response building methods for errors
   _unsupported_media_type and _serialize_bad_request which
   can be extended from an action-role to return custom
   error response.

1.01  2012-05-29 20:19:00 BST

 - Add Catalyst::Action::Deserialize::JSON::XS

 - Fix JSON::XS useage to depend on JSON.pm v2.0, and rely on the
   fact that can be backed by XS code, by explicitly setting
   $ENV{'PERL_JSON_BACKEND'} = 2

1.00  2012-04-13 09:31:00 BST

 - Repack without auto_include to stop Module::Install inlining
   Test::More without Test::Builder. RT#76524

0.99  2012-02-28 09:09:00 UTC

 - Repack with new Module::Install to stop depending on an unnecessary
   ExtUtils::MakeMaker version.

0.98  2012-02-21 11:40:00 UTC

 - More fixes as per last release.

0.97  2012-02-21 09:58:00 UTC

 - Fix test with latest Catalyst version which passes _log into
   requests.

0.96  2012-01-20 11:22:00 UTC

 - Added fix for RT 63537 (from Gerv) and tests to check it.

0.95  2012-01-04 19:34:00 UTC

 - Fix regex for JSONP parameter name to be able to include the . character
   in Catalyst::Action::Serialize::JSONP. RT#73741

 - Add optional location parameter to status_accepted handler. RT#73691 (ghenry)

0.94  2011-12-09 08:35:00 UTC

 - Add 403 Forbidden and 302 Not Found status methods to
   Catalyst::Controller::REST (Caleb Cushing)

0.93  2011-10-12 11:37:00 America/Chicago

 - Add a "Callback" serializer/deserializer to allow for more customization in
   how the REST data is parsed/generated (bphillips)

0.92  2011-10-01 11:04:00 BST

 - Add a Catalyst::Action::DeserializeMultiPart, allowing one part of a multipart
   request to be deserialized as the REST data (allowing other parts to be used for
   file uploads, for example) (bphillips)

0.91  2011-08-04 14:37:21 Europe/Berlin

 - For the deserialization action class, make the HTTP methods it operates on
   configurable on a per-action level (plu, rafl).

0.90  2011-02-25 13:56:00 UTC

 - Remove test which is no longer applicable and fails in the latest Catalyst
   release.

0.89  2011-01-24 21:57:42 UTC

 - All classes are now made immutable. (Dave Rolsky)

 - Added a Catalyst::Action::REST::ForBrowsers class. This will try to dispatch
   GET requests to a foo_GET_html method before trying foo_GET. (Dave Rolsky)

0.88  2011-01-11 23:07:00 UTC

 - Fix documentation for overriding Serialize and Deserialize actions
   in Catalyst::Controller::REST.

 - Avoid warning with empty response bodies and new Catalyst version
   (>= 5.80030)

 - Returning a body of '' is now possible - Catalyst::Action::Serialize
   acts like Catalyst::Action::RenderView (>= 0.16) by using the has_body
   predicate in Catalyst::Response (>= 5.80030)

0.87  2010-11-03 19:46:00 UTC

 - Fix Request class role when used with new Moose and other request
   class roles.

0.86  2010-09-01 23:14:00 BST

 - Add rest_serializer_json_options config key useable to set options
   like relaxed => 1 to be passed to the JSON serializer (Ton Voon)

 - Make Data::Dumper unserializer safer by using a Safe compartment (Ton Voon)

0.85  2010-05-13 10:09:19 Europe/Berlin

 - Make Catalyst::Action::Serialize::View return directly rather than serializing
   a response for 3XX status codes. This stops back-compat breakage from the
   previous change (in 0.84), whilst also allowing actual data serializers
   to still handle 3XX.

 - Fix docs in Catalyst::TraitFor::Request::REST::ForBrowsers. (RT#54983)

0.84  2010-05-06 09:27:56 BST

 - Revert always using a trait rather than Catalyst::Request::REST to improve
   debug messages.

 - Add a status_multiple_choices helper method to the Controller base class.

 - Allow 3XX responses to be serialized.

0.83  2010-02-08 22:17:12 UTC

 - Make it possible to deserialize a request with a DELETE method. This probably
   breaks 'strict' REST guidelines, but is useful for being able to delete multiple
   resources from a single call by providing a batch delete method.

 - Remove JSONP from the list of default serializers (RT#54336)
   Fix MANIFEST (RT#54408)

0.82  2010-02-04 22:31:57 UTC

 - Integrated Catalyst::Request::REST::ForBrowsers as
   Catalyst::TraitFor::Request::ForBrowsers. (Dave Rolsky)

 - Clarified docs so that they encourage the use of the request traits, rather
   than using Catalyst::Request::REST. (Dave Rolsky)

 - When Catalyst::Action::REST or Controller::REST automatically add the trait,
   your request class will no longer end up getting set to
   Catalyst::Request::REST. Instead, creates an anon class with the appropriate
   role. (Dave Rolsky)

 - Shut up log output from the tests. (Dave Rolsky)

 - Added a $VERSION to every module, mostly to make sure that when people
   install Catalyst::Request::REST::ForBrowsers, they get the version in this
   distro. (Dave Rolsky)

 - Change Catalyst::Action::Serialize, Catalyst::Action::Deserialize and
   Catalyst::Action::SerializeBase to be more Moose like.

 - Fix JSON and JSON::XS to encode_blessed. (fREW)
 - Fix Catalyst::Action::Serialize to use objects instead of classes. (fREW)
 - Fix doc nits. (RT#53780)

0.81  2010-01-14 20:56:00 UTC

 - Add a JSONP serialization type.

0.80  2009-12-19 14:54:00 UTC

 - Convert all classes to Moose

 - Change Catalyst::Request::REST to be a mostly empty class, with
   all the functionality in Catalyst::TraitFor::Request::REST

 - Simplify _get_allowed_methods method (aristotle)

 - Rework serializer return so that serializers throw an exception in
   the case of issues serializing the data (hobbs).

0.79  2009-12-11 01:08:00 UTC

 - Cope with invalid (missing required q parameter) header like:
   application/json; charset="utf-8"

 - Fix documentation to not mention deprecated things and generally be
   in better style.

 - Make author information consistant and only in one module.

0.78  2009-09-28 15:01:03 BST

 - Require Moose for the tests (RT#50066).

0.77  2009-08-27 02:21:09 BST

 - Allow dispatching to Catalyst Actions, for use with ActionClasses
   etc - fREW

 - Fix test if CATALYST_DEBUG environment variable is set

0.76  2009-08-21 21:20:52 BST

 - Added two new status response helpers (202 no content and 410 gone),
   and tests - Franck Cuny

0.75  2009-08-17 14:07:41 BST

 - Fix optional test failures in catalyst-action-serialize-accept.t
 - Added a serializer for JSON::XS
 - Made test independent of YAML::Syck bugs (dandv)

0.74  2009-07-22 23:49:16 BST (t0m)

 - Switch from NEXT to MRO::Compat (agladdish).

 - Add display of additional REST actions in the stats, and also fix a warning
   in Catalyst 5.80 when you forward to another action from inside an
   action_FOO method (as it was confusing the stats).

 - POD fixes
 - Catalyst::Action::REST no longer @ISA Catalyst or Catalyst::Controller.
 - Change constructor to call next::method instead of SUPER::
 - Change method used to find the application class to be more correct

0.73  2009-06-27 20:20:09 America/New_York (hdp)

 - Packaging fixes

0.72  2009-06-25 14:52:29 America/New_York (hdp)

 - Refresh Module::Install

0.71  2009-03-28 09:16:09 America/Los_Angeles (hdp)

 - Fix RT#44641, missing documented 'end' action

0.70  2009-03-27 23:21:17 America/Los_Angeles (hdp)

 - Tests that use JSON were either not checking for the version or checking in a
 - way that was a syntax error.

0.69  2009-03-26 14:16:03 America/Los_Angeles (hdp)

 - Fix RT#32342, deprecated config loses default map (hdp)
 - Fix broken insertion of Catalyst::Request::REST for Action::REST (jshirley)

0.68  2009-03-25 22:33:38 America/Los_Angeles (hdp)

 - Remove prompt for ancient and deprecated Data::Denter from Makefile.PL
 - Remove Data::Dump, which was entirely unused
 - Stop tests from dying with Catalyst 5.80

0.67  2009-03-25 21:59:59 America/Los_Angeles (hdp)

 - (no changes from 0.67_01)

0.67_01  2009-03-25 09:36:00 America/Los_Angeles (hdp)

 - Fix RT#43840, improper app-level config handling
 - Fix RT#42859, 'wrong' Catalyst dependency
 - Fix RT#42025, stepping on custom request classes

0.65  2008-08-20 10:42:00 America/Los_Angeles (jshirley)

0.64  2008-08-13 08:55:00 America/Los_Angeles (jshirley)

 - New dist to fix issue with Module::Install

0.63  2008-07-09 11:16:00 America/Los_Angeles (jshirley)

 - Changing from JSON::Syck to JSON/JSON::XS
 - Refactored tests to be more applicable to current state of affairs

0.62  2008-07-02 07:53:00 America/Los_Angeles (jshirley)

 - Reshipping with current Module::Install included due to error reports
   about failed installs

0.61  2008-06-30 12:28:00 America/Los_Angeles (jshirley)

 - Support official application/json and carp about text/x-json

 - Accepted patch from Luke Saunders for processing all accepted content types

0.60  2008-01-03 17:23:58 America/Los_Angeles (adam)

 - Updated my contact information.

 - Fixed RT#30498 - REST controller references Catalyst without
   loading it first.

 - Fixed RT#32042 - Import of Params::Validate :all plays badly
   with subclasses that have their own validate()

 - Fixed RT#30456 - Debug messages print even with debugging disabled

 - Fixed an issue where YAML::Syck versions 0.92 require $c->request->body to
   be stringified

 - Updated the configuration specifiers to operate more in line with the way
   Catalyst expects.  Most notably component based configuration through
   "Controller::RestClass" now works.  "serialize" at the top level simply
   is suggested defaults that all REST classes inherit.

 - Fixed 'default' serializer to set a valid Content-Type: header.  Fixes
   RT ticket 27949.  Note that behavior has changed -- the default
   serializer must now be specified as a content-type, not as a plugin
   name. (dmo@roaringpenguin.com)

0.41  2007-05-24 14:01:06 America/Los_Angeles (adam)

 - Moved a bogus $self->class to $c->component($self->class)

0.40  2007-03-09 14:13:29 America/Los_Angeles (adam)

 - Refactored the Content-Type negotiation to live in Catalyst::Request::REST.  (drolsky)
 - Added some useful debugging. (drolsky)
 - Added a View serializer/deserializer, which simply calls the correct
 - Catalyst view.  ('text/html' => [ 'View', 'TT' ]) (claco, adam)

0.31  2006-12-06 00:45:02 America/Los_Angeles (adam)

 - Fixed a bug where we would report a blank content-type negotiation.
 - Added Data::Dump as a dependency.

 - Made the YAML::HTML view automatically append content-type=text/html on
   the resulting URLs.

0.30  2006-12-03 12:24:16 America/Los_Angeles (adam)

 - Updated the Makefile to support optional installation of the different
   Serialization formats.

 - Renamed some of the test cases, since the execution order doesn't
   matter.

 - Fixed things so that not having a Serialization module returns 415.
 - Fixed things so that failure to Deserialize sends the proper status.
 - Refactored the Plugin loading to Catalyst::Action::SerializeBase.
 - Updated the Documentation.

 - Added a whole raft of serializers. (JSON, all the Data::Serializer
   supported ones, and XML::Simple)

 - Added test cases.

 - Refactored the Catalyst::Action::REST dispatch, so that the default
   method is called before any _METHOD handlers.  In addition, moved
   the 405 Not Implemented handler to be foo_not_implemented, instead
   of the default sub.  (daisuke++ pointed out the inconsistency and
   provided a patch, and I added the foo_not_implemented support)

 - Added in automated OPTIONS handler, which constructs the allow
   header for you, just like the 405 handler.  Can be overridden
   with a normal _METHOD sub.

 - Refactored Test::Rest, so that it uses closures to create the
   very similar $test->method() subs.

 - Added tests for Catalyst::Action::REST.

0.2  2006-11-30 17:14:51 America/Los_Angeles (adam)

 - Added documentation patch from Daisuke Maki (daisuke@endeworks.jp)
 - Added dependency patch from Daisuke Maki (daisuke@endeworks.jp)

0.1  2006-11-19 16:24:20 America/Los_Angeles (adam)

 - Added status_accepted (Code 202)
 - Added a first pass at documentation.
 - Added in Test Suite
 - Created Catalyst::Action::Serialize and Catalyst::Action::Deserialize
 - Added Data::Serializer actions
 - Added status_created helper method
 - Added more status_ helpers

 - Converted error helpers to return an object instead of plain-text.  It's
   a more consistent model than a text/plain error message.

 - Added logging to 4xx status handlers
