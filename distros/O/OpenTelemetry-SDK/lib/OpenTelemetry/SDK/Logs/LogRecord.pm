    # TODO: We don't currently restrict LogRecord attributes
    # The spec is a little vague on exactly how the attribute
    # restrictions work for LogRecord objects, but a reasonable
    # interpretation would be that the normal restrictions apply
    # _except_ the one that states that values can be either
    # nuclear types, or arrays of nuclear types. The ability
    # to set attributes that are nested arbitrarily deep is
    # needed to support existing loggers in the wild, and this
    # is not currently supported by OpenTelemetry::Attributes.
    # If we want to add it we'd probably need some way to
    # opt-in to the lax behaviour, probably like we used to do
    # for read-write attributes, which was removed in
    # 66ff6a4d83afdeb99882e524f7e37261fe337304.
    # Alternatively, we can expose the attribute validation
    # logic so we can call it from here, but that'd be more
    # awkward, because it relies on knowing what the limits
    # are. Let's not even get into the name of the SpanLimits
    # class, which would now apply to more than just spans...
