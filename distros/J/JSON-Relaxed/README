NAME

    JSON::Relaxed -- An extension of JSON that allows for better
    human-readability.

IMPORTANT NOTICE: TAKEOVER

    New maintainer will continue development provided it is possible
    to raise the minimal perl version to 5.26.

    This version if JSON::Relaxed has no functional changes from 0.05
    but only adds the 5.26 requirement. If users depend on this module
    to be functional on ancient versions of perl the takeover will be
    cancelled, the old version requirement restored, and a new module
    (different name) will be released for future development.

    For a look at the future, see:
    https://github.com/sciurius/perl-JSON-Relaxed .

SYNOPSIS

     my ($rjson, $hash, $parser);
     
     # raw RJSON code
     $rjson = <<'(RAW)';
     /* Javascript-like comments are allowed */
     {
       // single or double quotes allowed
       a : 'Larry',
       b : "Curly",
       
       // nested structures allowed like in JSON
       c: [
          {a:1, b:2},
       ],
       
       // like Perl, trailing commas are allowed
       d: "more stuff",
     }
     (RAW)
     
     # subroutine parsing
     $hash = from_rjson($rjson);
     
     # object-oriented parsing
     $parser = JSON::Relaxed::Parser->new();
     $hash = $parser->parse($rjson);

INSTALLATION

    JSON::Relaxed can be installed with the usual routine:

     perl Makefile.PL
     make
     make test
     make install

DESCRIPTION

    JSON::Relaxed is a lightweight parser and serializer for an extension
    of JSON called Relaxed JSON (RJSON). The intent of RJSON is to provide
    a format that is more human-readable and human-editable than JSON. Most
    notably, RJSON allows the use of JavaScript-like comments. By doing so,
    configuration files and other human-edited files can include comments
    to indicate the intention of each configuration.

    JSON::Relaxed is currently only a parser that reads in RJSON code and
    produces a data structure. JSON::Relaxed does not currently encode data
    structures into JSON/RJSON. That feature is planned.

 Why Relaxed JSON?

    There's been increasing support for the idea of expanding JSON to
    improve human-readability. "Relaxed" JSON is a term that has been used
    to describe a JSON-ish format that has some features that JSON doesn't.
    Although there isn't yet any kind of official specification,
    descriptions of Relaxed JSON generally include the following extensions
    to JSON:

      * comments

      RJSON supports JavaScript-like comments:

       /* inline comments */
       // line-based comments

      * trailing commas

      Like Perl, RJSON allows treats commas as separators. If nothing is
      before, after, or between commas, those commas are just ignored:

       [
          , // nothing before this comma
          "data",
          , // nothing after this comma
       ]

      * single quotes, double quotes, no quotes

      Strings can be quoted with either single or double quotes. Space-less
      strings are also parsed as strings. So, the following data items are
      equivalent:

       [
          "Starflower",
          'Starflower',
          Starflower
       ]

      Note that unquoted boolean values are still treated as boolean
      values, so the following are NOT the same:

       [
          "true",  // string
          true,    // boolean true
          
          "false", // string
          false,   // boolean false
          
          "null", // string
          null, // what Perl programmers call undef
       ]

      Because of this ambiguity, unquoted non-boolean strings should be
      considered sloppy and not something you do in polite company.

      * documents that are just a single string

      Early versions of JSON require that a JSON document contains either a
      single hash or a single array. Later versions also allow a single
      string. RJSON follows that later rule, so the following is a valid
      RJSON document:

       "Hello world"

      * hash keys without values

      A hash in JSON can have a key that is followed by a comma or a
      closing } without a specified value. In that case the hash element is
      simply assigned the undefined value. So, in the following example, a
      is assigned 1, b is assigned 2, and c is assigned undef:

       {
          a: 1,
          b: 2,
          c
       }

 from_rjson()

    from_rjson() is the simple way to quickly parse an RJSON string.
    Currently from_rjson() only takes a single parameter, the string
    itself. So in the following example, from_rjson() parses and returns
    the structure defined in $rjson.

     $structure = from_rjson($rjson);

 Object-oriented parsing

    To parse using an object, create a JSON::Relaxed::Parser object, like
    this:

     $parser = JSON::Relaxed::Parser->new();

    Then call the parser's <code>parse</code> method, passing in the RJSON
    string:

     $structure = $parser->parse($rjson);

    Methods

      * $parser->extra_tokens_ok()

      extra_tokens_ok() sets/gets the extra_tokens_ok property. By default,
      extra_tokens_ok is false. If by extra_tokens_ok is true then the
      multiple-structures isn't triggered and the parser returns the first
      structure it finds. So, for example, the following code would return
      undef and sets the multiple-structures error:

       $parser = JSON::Relaxed::Parser->new();
       $structure = $parser->parse('{"x":1} []');

      However, by setting multiple-structures to true, a hash structure is
      returned, the extra code after that first hash is ignored, and no
      error is set:

       $parser = JSON::Relaxed::Parser->new();
       $parser->extra_tokens_ok(1);
       $structure = $parser->parse('{"x":1} []');

 Error codes

    When JSON::Relaxed encounters a parsing error it returns undef and sets
    two global variables:

      * $JSON::Relaxed::err_id

      $err_id is a unique code for a specific error. Every code is set in
      only one place in JSON::Relaxed.

      * $JSON::Relaxed::err_msg

      $err_msg is an English description of the code. It would be cool to
      migrate towards multi-language support for $err_msg.

    Following is a list of all error codes in JSON::Relaxed:

      * missing-parameter

      The string to be parsed was not sent to $parser->parse(). For
      example:

       $parser->parse()

      * undefined-input

      The string to be parsed is undefined. For example:

       $parser->parse(undef)

      * zero-length-input

      The string to be parsed is zero-length. For example:

       $parser->parse('')

      * space-only-input

      The string to be parsed has no content beside space characters. For
      example:

       $parser->parse('   ')

      * no-content

      The string to be parsed has no content. This error is slightly
      different than space-only-input in that it is triggered when the
      input contains only comments, like this:

       $parser->parse('/* whatever */')

      * unclosed-inline-comment

      A comment was started with /* but was never closed. For example:

       $parser->parse('/*')

      * invalid-structure-opening-character

      The document opens with an invalid structural character like a comma
      or colon. The following examples would trigger this error.

       $parser->parse(':')
       $parser->parse(',')
       $parser->parse('}')
       $parser->parse(']')

      * multiple-structures

      The document has multiple structures. JSON and RJSON only allow a
      document to consist of a single hash, a single array, or a single
      string. The following examples would trigger this error.

       $parse->parse('{}[]')
       $parse->parse('{} "whatever"')
       $parse->parse('"abc" "def"')

      * unknown-token-after-key

      A hash key may only be followed by the closing hash brace or a colon.
      Anything else triggers unknown-token-after-key. So, the following
      examples would trigger this error.

       $parse->parse("{a [ }") }
       $parse->parse("{a b") }

      * unknown-token-for-hash-key

      The parser encountered something besides a string where a hash key
      should be. The following are examples of code that would trigger this
      error.

       $parse->parse('{{}}')
       $parse->parse('{[]}')
       $parse->parse('{]}')
       $parse->parse('{:}')

      * unclosed-hash-brace

      A hash has an opening brace but no closing brace. For example:

       $parse->parse('{x:1')

      * unclosed-array-brace

      An array has an opening brace but not a closing brace. For example:

       $parse->parse('["x", "y"')

      * unexpected-token-after-colon

      In a hash, a colon must be followed by a value. Anything else
      triggers this error. For example:

       $parse->parse('{"a":,}')
       $parse->parse('{"a":}')

      * missing-comma-between-array-elements

      In an array, a comma must be followed by a value, another comma, or
      the closing array brace. Anything else triggers this error. For
      example:

       $parse->parse('[ "x" "y" ]')
       $parse->parse('[ "x" : ]')

      * unknown-array-token

      This error exists just in case there's an invalid token in an array
      that somehow wasn't caught by missing-comma-between-array-elements.
      This error shouldn't ever be triggered. If it is please let me know.

      * unclosed-quote

      This error is triggered when a quote isn't closed. For example:

       $parse->parse("'whatever")
       $parse->parse('"whatever') }

INTERNALS

    The following documentation is for if you want to edit the code of
    JSON::Relaxed itself.

 JSON::Relaxed

    JSON::Relaxed is the parent package. Not a lot actually happens in
    JSON::Relaxed, it mostly contains from_rjson() and definitions of
    various structures.

    Special character and string definitions

      The following hashes provide information about characters and strings
      that have special meaning in RJSON.

	* Escape characters

	The %esc hash defines the six escape characters in RJSON that are
	changed to single characters. %esc is defined as follows.

         our %esc = (
           'b'   => "\b",    #  Backspace
           'f'   => "\f",    #  Form feed
           'n'   => "\n",    #  New line
           'r'   => "\r",    #  Carriage return
           't'   => "\t",    #  Tab
           'v'   => chr(11), #  Vertical tab
         );

	* Structural characters

	The %structural hash defines the six characters in RJSON that
	define the structure of the data object. The structural characters
	are defined as follows.

         our %structural = (
           '[' => 1, # beginning of array
           ']' => 1, # end of array
           '{' => 1, # beginning of hash
           '}' => 1, # end of hash
           ':' => 1, # delimiter between name and value of hash element
           ',' => 1, # separator between elements in hashes and arrays
         );

	* Quotes

	The %quotes hash defines the two types of quotes recognized by
	RJSON: single and double quotes. JSON only allows the use of double
	quotes to define strings. Relaxed also allows single quotes.
	%quotes is defined as follows.

         our %quotes = (
           '"' => 1,
           "'" => 1,
         );

	* End of line characters

	The %newlines hash defines the three ways a line can end in a RJSON
	document. Lines in Windows text files end with carriage-return
	newline ("\r\n"). Lines in Unixish text files end with newline
	("\n"). Lines in some operating systems end with just carriage
	returns ("\n"). %newlines is defined as follows.

         our %newlines = (
           "\r\n" => 1,
           "\r" => 1,
           "\n" => 1,
         );

	* Boolean

	The %boolean hash defines strings that are boolean values: true,
	false, and null. (OK, 'null' isn't just a boolean value, but I
	couldn't think of what else to call this hash.) %boolean is defined
	as follows.

         our %boolean = (
           'null' => 1,
           'true' => 1,
           'false' => 1,
         );

 JSON::Relaxed::Parser

    A JSON::Relaxed::Parser object parses the raw RJSON string. You don't
    need to instantiate a parser if you just want to use the default
    settings. In that case just use from_rjson().

    You would create a JSON::Relaxed::Parser object if you want to
    customize how the string is parsed. I say "would" because there isn't
    actually any customization in these early releases. When there is
    you'll use a parser object.

    To parse in an object oriented manner, create the parser, then parse.

     $parser = JSON::Relaxed::Parser->new();
     $structure = $parser->parse($string);

    new

      JSON::Relaxed::Parser-new()> creates a parser object. Its simplest
      and most common use is without any parameters.

       my $parser = JSON::Relaxed::Parser->new();

      option: unknown

	The unknown option sets the character which creates the unknown
	object. The unknown object exists only for testing JSON::Relaxed.
	It has no purpose in production use.

         my $parser = JSON::Relaxed::Parser->new(unknown=>'~');

    Parser "is" methods

      The following methods indicate if a token has some specific property,
      such as being a string object or a structural character.

	* is_string()

	Returns true if the token is a string object, i.e. in the class
	JSON::Relaxed::Parser::Token::String.

	* is_struct_char()

	Returns true if the token is one of the structural characters of
	JSON, i.e. one of the following:

         { } [ ] : ,

	* is_unknown_char()

	Returns true if the token is the unknown character.

	* is_list_opener()

	Returns true if the token is the opening character for a hash or an
	array, i.e. it is one of the following two characters:

         { [

	* is_comment_opener()

	Returns true if the token is the opening character for a comment,
	i.e. it is one of the following two couplets:

         /*
         //

    parse()

      parse() is the method that does the work of parsing the RJSON string.
      It returns the data structure that is defined in the RJSON string. A
      typical usage would be as follows.

       my $parser = JSON::Relaxed::Parser->new();
       my $structure = $parser->parse('["hello world"]');

      parse() does not take any options.

    parse_chars()

      parse_chars() parses the RJSON string into either individual
      characters or two-character couplets. This method returns an array.
      The only input is the raw RJSON string. So, for example, the
      following string:

       $raw = qq|/*x*/["y"]|;
       @chars = $parser->parse_chars($raw);

      would be parsed into the following array:

       ( "/*", "x", "*/", "[", "\"", "y", "\""", "]" )

      Most of the elements in the array are single characters. However,
      comment delimiters, escaped characters, and Windows-style newlines
      are parsed as two-character couplets:

	* \ followed by any character

	* \r\n

	* //

	* /*

	* */

      parse_chars() should not produce any fatal errors.

    tokenize()

      tokenize() organizes the characters from parse_chars() into tokens.
      Those tokens can then be organized into a data structure with
      structure().

      Each token represents an item that is recognized by JSON. Those items
      include structural characters such as { or }, or strings such as
      "hello world". Comments and insignificant whitespace are filtered out
      by tokenize().

      For example, this code:

       $parser = JSON::Relaxed::Parser->new();
       $raw = qq|/*x*/ ["y"]|;
       @chars = $parser->parse_chars($raw);
       @tokens = $parser->tokenize(\@chars);

      would produce an array like this:

       (
         '[',
         JSON::Relaxed::Parser::Token::String::Quoted=HASH(0x20bf0e8),
         ']'
       )

      Strings are tokenized into string objects. When the parsing is
      complete they are returned as scalar variables, not objects.

      tokenize() should not produce any fatal errors.

    structure()

      $parser-structure()> organizes the tokens from tokenize() into a data
      structure. $parser-structure()> returns a single string, single array
      reference, a single hash reference, or (if there are errors) undef.

 JSON::Relaxed::Parser::Structure::Hash

    This package parses Relaxed into hash structures. It is a static
    package, i.e. it is not instantiated.

    build()

      This static method accepts the array of tokens and works through them
      building the hash reference that they represent. When build() reaches
      the closing curly brace (}) it returns the hash reference.

    get_value

      This static method gets the value of a hash element. This method is
      called after a hash key is followed by a colon. A colon must be
      followed by a value. It may not be followed by the end of the tokens,
      a comma, or a closing brace.

 JSON::Relaxed::Parser::Structure::Array

    This package parses Relaxed into array structures. It is a static
    package, i.e. it is not instantiated.

    build()

      This static method accepts the array of tokens and works through them
      building the array reference that they represent. When build()
      reaches the closing square brace (]) it returns the array reference.

    missing_comma()

      This static method build the missing-comma-between-array-elements
      error message.

    invalid_array_token)

      This static method build the unknown-array-token error message.

 JSON::Relaxed::Parser::Token::String

    Base class . Nothing actually happens in this package, it's just a base
    class for JSON::Relaxed::Parser::Token::String::Quoted and
    JSON::Relaxed::Parser::Token::String::Unquoted.

 JSON::Relaxed::Parser::Token::String::Quoted

    A JSON::Relaxed::Parser::Token::String::Quoted object represents a
    string in the document that is delimited with single or double quotes.
    In the following example, Larry and Curly would be represented by
    Quoted objects by Moe would not.

     [
        "Larry",
        'Curly',
        Moe
     ]

    Quoted objects are created by $parser->tokenize() when it works through
    the array of characters in the document.

      * new()

      new() instantiates a JSON::Relaxed::Parser::Token::String::Quoted
      object and slurps in all the characters in the characters array until
      it gets to the closing quote. Then it returns the new Quoted object.

      A Quoted object has the following two properties:

      raw: the string that is inside the quotes. If the string contained
      any escape characters then the escapes are processed and the
      unescaped characters are in raw. So, for example, \n would become an
      actual newline.

      quote: the delimiting quote, i.e. either a single quote or a double
      quote.

      * as_perl()

      as_perl() returns the string that was in quotes (without the quotes).

 JSON::Relaxed::Parser::Token::String::Unquoted

    A JSON::Relaxed::Parser::Token::String::Unquoted object represents a
    string in the document that was not delimited quotes. In the following
    example, Moe would be represented by an Unquoted object, but Larry and
    Curly would not.

     [
        "Larry",
        'Curly',
        Moe
     ]

    Unquoted objects are created by $parser->tokenize() when it works
    through the array of characters in the document.

    An Unquoted object has one property, raw, which is the string. Escaped
    characters are resolved in raw.

      * new()

      new() instantiates a JSON::Relaxed::Parser::Token::String::Unquoted
      object and slurps in all the characters in the characters array until
      it gets to a space character, a comment, or one of the structural
      characters such as { or :.

      * as_perl()

      as_perl() returns the unquoted string or a boolean value, depending
      on how it is called.

      If the string is a boolean value, i.e. true, false, then the as_perl
      return 1 (for true), 0 (for false) or undef (for null), unless the
      always_string option is sent, in which case the string itself is
      returned. If the string does not represent a boolean value then it is
      returned as-is.

      $parser->structure() sends the always_string when the token is a key
      in a hash. The following example should clarify how always_string is
      used:

       {
          // key: the literal string "larry"
          // value: 1
          larry : true,
          
          // key: the literal string "true"
          // value: 'x'
          true : 'x',
          
          // key: the literal string "null"
          // value: 'y'
          null : 'y',
          
          // key: the literal string "z"
          // value: undef
          z : null,
       }

 JSON::Relaxed::Parser::Token::Unknown

    This class is just used for development of JSON::Relaxed. It has no use
    in production. This class allows testing for when a token is an unknown
    object.

    To implement this class, add the 'unknown' option to
    JSON::Relaxed->new(). The value of the option should be the character
    that creates an unknown object. For example, the following option sets
    the tilde (~) as an unknown object.

     my $parser = JSON::Relaxed::Parser->new(unknown=>'~');

    The "unknown" character must not be inside quotes or inside an unquoted
    string.

VERSION

    Version: 0.051

HISTORY

    Version 0.01 Nov 30, 2014

      Initial version.

    Version 0.02 Dec 3, 2014

      Fixed test.t so that it can load lib.pm when it runs.

      Added $parser->extra_tokens_ok(). Removed error code
      invalid-structure-opening-string and allowed that error to fall
      through to multiple-structures.

      Cleaned up documentation.

    Version 0.03 Dec 6, 2014

      Modified test for parse_chars to normalize newlines. Apparently the
      way Perl on Windows handles newline is different than what I
      expected, but as long as it's recognizing newlines and|or carriage
      returns then the test should pass.

      Takeover by new maintainer.
