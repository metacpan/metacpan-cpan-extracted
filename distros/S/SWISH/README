SWISH - Sat Nov  1 22:47:45 UTC 2003

    The modules SWISH and SWISH::Fork are depreciated

    Swish-e 2.4.0 has been released.  2.4.0 is a major rewrite of
    the C API, and thus there's a new Perl module SWISH::API
    available.  SWISH::API is a better interface for Swish-e
    than this module and is now the recommend way to access
    Swish-e with Perl.
    
    SWISH::API is distributed with Swish-e 2.4.0, but will soon be
    removed from the distribution and placed on CPAN.
