NAME
    SVN::Tree - SVN::Fs plus Tree::Path::Class

VERSION
    version 0.005

SYNOPSIS
        use SVN::Tree;
        use SVN::Core;
        use SVN::Repos;
        use SVN::Fs;

        my $repos = SVN::Repos::open('/path/to/repository');
        my $fs = $repos->fs;

        my $tree = SVN::Tree->new(root => $fs->revision_root($fs->youngest_rev));
        print map {$_->path->stringify} $tree->tree->traverse;

DESCRIPTION
    This module marries Tree::Path::Class to the Perl Subversion bindings,
    enabling you to traverse the files and directories of Subversion
    revisions and transactions, termed roots in Subversion API parlance.

ATTRIBUTES
  root
    Required attribute referencing a _p_svn_fs_root object.

  tree
    Read-only accessor for the Tree::Path::Class object describing the
    filesystem hierarchy contained in the "root". Will be updated every time
    the "root" attribute is changed.

  projects
    Read-only accessor returning an array reference containing one or more
    Tree::Path::Class hierarchies for the top-level project directories in
    the repository. In the case of a repository with trunk, branches and
    tags at the top level, this will be one element referring to the same
    hierarchy available through the "tree" attribute.

    Like "tree" this will also be updated with "root" changes.

  branches
    Read-only accessor returning a hash reference of arrays containing
    Tree::Path::Class objects for each branch in each project in the
    repository. The hash keys are the names of the projects, and trunk
    counts as a branch.

    Like "tree" this will also be updated with "root" changes.

SEE ALSO
    The distribution for this module also includes MooseX::Types::SVN, a
    Moose type library for the Subversion Perl bindings. This may be split
    off into its own distribution at a later point if it proves useful in
    other projects.
