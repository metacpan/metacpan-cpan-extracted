=head1 NAME

Acme::SuperCollider::Programming - Representing the Community for SuperCollider Programming

=head1 DESCRIPTION

In a cruel under-representation of the true scale and awesomeness of the
L<SuperCollider Programming|http://www.audiosynth.com/> community, one
popular ranking index has ranked SuperCollider as the 96th most popular language.

Clearly, this is not a realistic ranking of the SuperCollider Programming
profession.

To those who would undervalue the hard-working members of the SuperCollider
Programming collective, we say NO! NO MORE!

By leveraging the 3-4,000 pages that will be created for this distribution,
mentioning B<Acme::SuperCollider::Programming>,
or C<Acme-SuperCollider-Programming>, all of which can be happily found with
a search for C<+"SuperCollider Programming">, this distribution will help to
restore the ranking of the SuperCollider Programming language to a more
accurate and realistic position.

=head1 SUPPORT
