=head1 NAME

dzooky - convert a dist to Dist::Zilla

=head1 VERSION

version 0.24

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  $ cd Some-Dist-Dir
  $ dzooky

=head1 DESCRIPTION

dzooky is L<Dist::Zilla>'s nephew. He has the ability to summon his uncle.

dzooky will try its best to convert a distribution to use L<Dist::Zilla>. It
supports L<ExtUtils::MakeMaker>, L<Module::Install> and L<Module::Build> based
distributions, with certain limitations.

Simply execute C<dzooky> in the directory containing the distribution you wish
to convert to L<Dist::Zilla>. C<dzooky> will determine the type of distribution
it is and execute the C<Makefile.PL> or C<Build.PL> and gather meta information
to generate a C<dist.ini> file for you.

It will C<die> on any error conditions it encounters.

If you do not wish to execute C<Makefile.PL> or C<Build.PL> and have C<META.json>
or C<META.yml>, you may use the C<metafile> command to merely examine those files.

  $ dzooky metafile

dzooky also supports specifying a C<Dist::Zilla> bundle to use instead of the
defaults.

  $ dzooky dist --bundle BINGOS

This will add [@BINGOS] to the generated C<dist.ini>.

=head1 CAVEAT PROGRAMMER

This should be considered as experimental for the moment. It does work in the main
but there are some C<gotchas>.

The L<ExtUtils::MakeMaker> examination is done by parsing the C<Makefile> that is
produced by executing C<Makefile.PL>. L<Module::Install> will also fall back to
this mechanism if a C<MYMETA.json> or C<MYMETA.yml> file is not generated.

The L<Module::Build> examination is purely from C<MYMETA.json> or C<MYMETA.yml>.

This has some limitations.

=head1 TODO

As we pull a lot of data from C<MYMETA.json> or C<MYMETA.yml> ( where applicable ), we could fill in
a lot more of the C<dist.ini> automatically.

The L<Module::Install> code does not take into account dists using L<Module::AutoInstall>,
maybe it should. Any ideas for achieving this would be welcome.
