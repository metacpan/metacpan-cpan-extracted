=item $obj-E<gt>B<fieldContentsToHtml>( $field, [$subject] )

Format one field from the header to HTML.  When the header line usually
contains e-mail addresses, the line is scanned and valid addresses
are linked with an C<mailto:> anchor.  The C<$subject> can be specified to
be included in that link.

=item $obj-E<gt>B<fieldToHtml>( $field, [$subject] )

Reformat one header line field to HTML.  The C<$field>'s name
is printed in bold, followed by the formatted field content,
which is produced by L<fieldContentsToHtml()|Mail::Message::Convert::Html/"Converting">.

=item $obj-E<gt>B<headToHtmlHead>($head, $meta)

Translate the selected header lines (fields) to an html page header.  Each
selected field will get its own meta line with the same name as the line.
Furthermore, the C<Subject> field will become the C<title>,
and C<From> is used for the C<Author>.

Besides, you can specify your own meta fields, which will overrule header
fields.  Empty fields will not be included.  When a C<title> is specified,
this will become the html title, otherwise the C<Subject> field is
taken.  In list context, the lines are separately, where in scalar context
the whole text is returned as one.

If you need to add lines to the head (for instance, http-equiv lines), then
splice them before the last element in the returned list.

» example: 

  my @head = $html->headToHtmlHead(
        $head,
        description => 'This is a message',
        generator   => 'Mail::Box',
  );
  splice @head, -1, 0, '<meta http-equiv=...>';
  print @head;

=item $obj-E<gt>B<headToHtmlTable>( $head, [$table_params] )

Produce a display of the L<selectedFields()|Mail::Message::Convert/"Converting"> of the header in a
table shape.  The optional C<$table_params> are added as parameters to the
produced TABLE tag.  In list context, the separate lines are returned.
In scalar context, everything is returned as one.

» example: 

  print $html->headToHtmlTable($head, 'width="50%"');

=item $obj-E<gt>B<selectedFields>($head)

Inherited, see L<Mail::Message::Convert/"Converting">

=item $obj-E<gt>B<textToHtml>($lines)

Translate one or more C<$lines> from text into HTML.  Each line is taken one
after the other, and only simple things are translated.  C<textToHtml>
is able to convert large plain texts in a descent fashion.  In scalar
context, the resulting lines are returned as one.

=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

=over 4

=item Error: class $package does not implement method $method.

Fatal error: the specific C<$package> (or one of its superclasses) does not
implement this method where it should. This message means that some other
related classes do implement this method however the class at hand does
not.  Probably you should investigate this and probably inform the author
of the package.
