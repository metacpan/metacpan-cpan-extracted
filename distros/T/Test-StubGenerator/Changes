Revision history for Test-StubGenerator

0.9.6   August 26, 2009
        Took the option to tidy the generated test code out of
        the tests due to too many test failures from various
        conflicting perltidyrc files.

0.9.5   August 13, 2007
        Removed the debugging code I accidentally left enabled :(

0.9.4   August 13, 2007
        Added TODO file to keep track of ideas I want to implement,
        even though it's not really very full.  Added examples directory
        to help add kwalitee.  Added support for hashes as args to methods.

0.9.3   August 8, 2007
        Forgot that the order of each %hash was different for older
        perls, so converted each %self->{structure}->{methods} to use
        a for loop so i could sort the output.

0.9.2   August 7, 2007
        Forgot to update the tests for the change of the name of the
        perltidyrc option.  Also forgot to update this file, but who's
        counting?

0.9.1   August 7, 2007
        Uploaded to CPAN, many tests failed, realized I needed an option
        for a user configurable perltidyrc, so added pertidyrc as an option,
        defaulting to ~/.perltidyrc.

0.9.0   August 1, 2007
        First version checked into repository.
