0.1712  May, 14th 2014
        - Make OLE.xs compatible with 64-bit Cygwin.  Thanks to
          Alexander Stadler [RT #95612]

0.1711  December, 11th 2013
	- remove EUMM-Update changes to Makefile.PL, which removed
	  the updated metadata in 0.1710 from META.yml

0.1710  December, 4th 2013
	- Speedup Win32::OLE::Const by avoiding unneccessary calls to
	  stat().  Thanks to Eric Roode.
	- Skip ANSI <-> OEM conversion test unless the OEM code page
	  is 437 or 850 [RT #53704]
	- Fix required perl version 5.6 -> 5.006.
	- Add Github repo link to META.yml
	- Typo fixes by David Steinbrunner
        - Avoid 5.18 bug in t/3_ole.t about AUTOLOAD inheritance failure
          using SUPER:: [perl #120694]

0.1709  April 17th 2008
	- Get rid of "package Win32" statement in lib/OLE.pm because
	  it confuses the CPAN indexer.

0.1708  April 17th 2008
	- new version for separate upload to CPAN
	- updated email addresses
	- simplified Makefile.PL
	- added META.yml
	- additional casts to suppress compiler warnings under Win64
	- added V_RECORD() and V_RECORDINFO macros for MinGW
	- changed code to be conformant with ISO for() variable scoping rules

0.1707  unreleased, August 7th 2006
	- add special support for tlbinf32.dll from Microsoft

0.1706	unreleased, June 8th 2006
	- add support for receiving VT_RECORD and arrays of VT_RECORD
	- improve error handling logic

0.1705	unreleased, March 28th 2006
	- fix memory leak in Win32::OLE::Enum::All() and Win32::OLE::Enum::Next()
	  (as a side effect collections containing undefined elements,
	   like VT_NULL or VT_EMPTY variant, will be handled correctly)

0.1704	unreleased, November 28th 2005
	- in ClearVariantObject() check IDispatch/IUnknown variants
	  for NULL before calling Release() on them
	- Win32::OLE::Const: check for 32 bit typelibs even in Win64 mode
	- Don't load hidden or restricted types in Win32::OLE::Const.
	  This fixes the "emptyenum redefined" problem with the "Microsoft
	  Word" type library.

0.1703	September 6th 2005
	- remove all USING_WIDE() codepaths
	- use PTR2IV() and INT2PTR() macros
	- make everything work with current cygwin

0.1702	unreleased, Sun, September 5th 2004
	- fix freeing of VT_BYREF Win32::OLE::Variant objects

0.1701	unreleased, Thu, August 28th 2003
	- add Win32::OLE->Option(Variant => 1) support

0.17	Mon, August 11th 2003
	- add IsNothing and IsNullString predicate methods to
	  Win32::OLE::Variant
	- nullstring() variants used to be converted to undef.  They
	  are now converted to the empty string.

0.1604	unreleased, Thu, July 22nd 2003
	- fix passing nullstring() as a parameter.  VariantCopy() used
	  to turn it back into an empty string.

	- fix PL_dowarn test to only check the relevant bit

0.1602	unreleased, Thu, February 13th 2003
	- Work around a Perl problem to support lvalue arguments to OLE
	  method calls (e.g. substr() expressions).  This will only work
	  for PV lvalues, and not for IV lvalues (like pos()).

0.1601	Fri, November 22nd, 2002
	- allow Variant(VT_VARIANT|VT_BYREF) as a shortcut for
	  Variant(VT_VARIANT|VT_BYREF, Variant(VT_EMPTY))

0.16	Fri, October 18th, 2002
	- Add Unicode support: passing Unicode strings to methods and
	  properties as well as returning Unicode back to Perl works now
	- Unicode::String objects can be passed to methods or assigned
	  to properties
	- Make Unicode support compatible with Perl 5.8
	- Remove prototype checking from Win32::OLE::Forward() so that
	  it works normally as an automation method too
	- Fix compatibility problem ($AUTOLOAD munging) with Devel::DProf
	- Add Win32::OLE::nullstring() method [alias for Variant(VT_BSTR)]
	- Fix 2_variant.t tests for non-US locales

0.1502	September, 7th 2001
	- Only turn undef into VT_ERROR/DISP_E_PARAMNOTFOUND when used as a
	  positional parameter in a method call.  Otherwise turn it into
	  VT_EMPTY.

0.1501	February, 6th 2001
	- Don't clobber $1 etc. in AUTOLOAD.  Unfortunately Perl doesn't set
	  POK on the $1 SV, so we still cannot pass it to OLE methods. :(

0.15	Wed, December 6th, 2000
	- Make sure the OLE browser works with IE5.5 and the latest ActivePerl
	- Relax the checks for file existance in Win32::OLE::Const

	- Win32::OLE::Const: ignore non-existant typelibs (by Richard Letts)
	- safeguard against access violation in Dispatch()

	  rethrow the exception to get the runlevel right

0.1402	Mon, September 25th, 2000
	- Fix potential crash during global cleanup when _Unique is set
	  (by Rudi Farkas <rudolf.farkas@lecroy.com>)

0.1401	Mon, September 11th, 2000
	- fix bug in GetMultiByteEx() sometimes chopping off the last byte

0.14	Tue, August 22th, 2000
	- remove support for Perl 5.004 & 5.005
	- don't built for 5.005 Threads (because it won't work anyways)
	- make sure the other compile options for 5.6 work
	- support embedded '\0's in BSTR return values

0.1301	Thur, July 13th, 2000 (dougl@ActiveState.com)
	- patch to fix exported functions
	- lost UTF-8 support added back in

0.13	Sat, May 6th, 2000
	- add Win32::OLE::Variant::nothing() function
	- fix strrev() definition for Borland
	- changes based on ideas and patches from Rudi Farkas
          <rudolf.farkas@lecroy.com>:
	  - add _Unique option to prevent creating duplicate proxy Win32::OLE
	    objects for the same COM object
	  - add _NewEnum option to add a visible _NewEnum property to
	    collection objects.

	- Win32::OLE::Variant: Support for SAFEARRAYs (VT_ARRAY) added
	  New methods: Dim/Get/Put

	- Initialize/Uninitialize/SpinMessageLoop reset LastError
	- EXPERIMENTAL ITypeInfo stuff
	- CP_MACCP, CP_UTF7, CP_UTF8 constants in OLE.pm

	  constant) to disable COM initialization by Win32::OLE

	- memory corruption fix (for ->SetProperty method) by Gurusamy Sarathy
	- document *nitialize(), SpinMessageLoop()

0.0902	(unreleased)
	- Allow specification of apartment model to Initialize() method. Special
	  case is COINIT_OLEINITIALIZE to fall back to OleInitialize(). This
	  is required to instantiate objects using compound document technology,
	  like e.g. "MAPI.Session".
	- Compatibility module now uses OleInitilize()

0.0901	(unreleased)
	- PL_na replaced by local variables
	- Dispatch method now accepts [wFlags, 'method'] to specify
	  various dispatch flags, e.g. DISPATCH_PROPERTYPUT

0.0808  (unreleased)
	- Introduced USE_SV_PERINTERP to switch off perl_atexit() usage

0.0807  (unreleased)

	  window problem.
	- Fixed warning in Win32::OLE::Const when called without arg

0.0806  (unreleased)
	- Bug fixes for IsLocalMachine()
	- Free per-interpreter memory area at interpreter-exit

0.0802  (unreleased)
	- Win32::OLE->new(['Machine', 'Prog.Id']) does a remote registry lookup
	  if the Prog.Id is not registered locally.
	- CLSCTX changed to CLSCTX_REMOTE_SERVER when a machine is specified.
	  Otherwise OLE would still prefer a local server when available

0.0801  (unreleased)
	- Win32::OLE::Tie::(FETCH|STORE) now interpret $^H correctly
	- removed all Perl related stuff from DllMain (for embedded stuff)
	- Additional checks in GetOleObject for Perl 5.004_05 or later

	- Win32::OLE::LastError() returns $Win32::OLE::LastError
