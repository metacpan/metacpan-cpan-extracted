=head1 VERSION

version 0.013

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	use HTML::Show;
	use Chart::Plotly;
	use Chart::Plotly::Trace::Attribute::Lighting;
	my $lighting = Chart::Plotly::Trace::Attribute::Lighting->new(x => [1 .. 5], y => [1 .. 5]);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This file has been autogenerated from the official plotly.js source.

=head1 NAME 

Chart::Plotly::Trace::Attribute::Lighting

=head1 DISCLAIMER

This is an unofficial Plotly Perl module. Currently I'm not affiliated in any way with Plotly. 
But I think plotly.js is a great library and I want to use it with perl.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 TO_JSON

Serialize the trace to JSON. This method should be called only by L<JSON> serializer.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=over

=item * ambient

Ambient light increases overall color visibility but can wash out the image.

=item * diffuse

Represents the extent that incident rays are reflected in a range of angles.

=item * fresnel

Represents the reflectance as a dependency of the viewing angle; e.g. paper is reflective when viewing it from the edge of the paper (almost 90 degrees), causing shine.

=item * roughness

Alters specular reflection; the rougher the surface, the wider and less contrasty the shine.

=item * specular

Represents the level that incident rays are reflected in a single direction, causing shine.

=item * name

Sets the trace name
