NAME
    Setup::File::Symlink - Setup symlink (existence, target)

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.29 of Setup::File::Symlink (from Perl
    distribution Setup-File-Symlink), released on 2017-07-10.

FUNCTIONS
  ln_s
    Usage:

     ln_s(%args) -> [status, msg, result, meta]

    Create symlink.

    Fixed state: "symlink" exists and points to "target".

    Fixable state: "symlink" doesn't exist.

    This function is not exported.

    This function is idempotent (repeated invocations with same arguments
    has the same effect as single invocation). This function supports
    transactions.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   symlink => *str*

        Path to symlink.

    *   target => *str*

        Path to target.

    Special arguments:

    *   -tx_action => *str*

        For more information on transaction, see Rinci::Transaction.

    *   -tx_action_id => *str*

        For more information on transaction, see Rinci::Transaction.

    *   -tx_recovery => *str*

        For more information on transaction, see Rinci::Transaction.

    *   -tx_rollback => *str*

        For more information on transaction, see Rinci::Transaction.

    *   -tx_v => *str*

        For more information on transaction, see Rinci::Transaction.

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element (status) is an integer containing HTTP status code (200
    means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second element (msg) is
    a string containing error message, or 'OK' if status is 200. Third
    element (result) is optional, the actual result. Fourth element (meta)
    is called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information.

    Return value: (any)

  rmsym
    Usage:

     rmsym(%args) -> [status, msg, result, meta]

    Delete symlink.

    Will not delete non-symlinks.

    Fixed state: "path" doesn't exist.

    Fixable state: "path" exists, is a symlink, (and if "target" is defined,
    points to "target").

    This function is not exported.

    This function is idempotent (repeated invocations with same arguments
    has the same effect as single invocation). This function supports
    transactions.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   path => *str*

    *   target => *str*

        Only delete if existing symlink has this target.

    Special arguments:

    *   -tx_action => *str*

        For more information on transaction, see Rinci::Transaction.

    *   -tx_action_id => *str*

        For more information on transaction, see Rinci::Transaction.

    *   -tx_recovery => *str*

        For more information on transaction, see Rinci::Transaction.

    *   -tx_rollback => *str*

        For more information on transaction, see Rinci::Transaction.

    *   -tx_v => *str*

        For more information on transaction, see Rinci::Transaction.

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element (status) is an integer containing HTTP status code (200
    means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second element (msg) is
    a string containing error message, or 'OK' if status is 200. Third
    element (result) is optional, the actual result. Fourth element (meta)
    is called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information.

    Return value: (any)

  setup_symlink
    Usage:

     setup_symlink(%args) -> [status, msg, result, meta]

    Setup symlink (existence, target).

    When "should_exist=>1" (the default): On do, will create symlink which
    points to specified target. If symlink already exists but points to
    another target, it will be replaced with the correct symlink if
    "replace_symlink" option is true. If a file/dir already exists and
    "replace_file"/"replace_dir" option is true, it will be moved (trashed)
    first before the symlink is created. On undo, will delete symlink if it
    was created by this function, and restore the original symlink/file/dir
    if it was replaced during do.

    When "should_exist=>0": On do, will remove symlink if it exists (and
    "replace_symlink" is true). If "replace_file"/"replace_dir" is true,
    will also remove file/dir. On undo, will restore deleted
    symlink/file/dir.

    This function is not exported by default, but exportable.

    This function is idempotent (repeated invocations with same arguments
    has the same effect as single invocation). This function supports
    transactions.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   create => *bool* (default: 1)

        Create if symlink doesn't exist.

        If set to false, then setup will fail (412) if this condition is
        encountered.

    *   replace_dir => *bool* (default: 0)

        Replace if there is existing dir.

        If set to false, then setup will fail (412) if this condition is
        encountered.

    *   replace_file => *bool* (default: 0)

        Replace if there is existing non-symlink file.

        If set to false, then setup will fail (412) if this condition is
        encountered.

    *   replace_symlink => *bool* (default: 1)

        Replace previous symlink if it already exists but doesn't point to
        the wanted target.

        If set to false, then setup will fail (412) if this condition is
        encountered.

    *   should_exist => *bool* (default: 1)

        Whether symlink should exist.

    *   symlink* => *str*

        Path to symlink.

    *   target => *str*

        Target path of symlink.

        Required, unless "should_exist => 0".

    Special arguments:

    *   -tx_action => *str*

        For more information on transaction, see Rinci::Transaction.

    *   -tx_action_id => *str*

        For more information on transaction, see Rinci::Transaction.

    *   -tx_recovery => *str*

        For more information on transaction, see Rinci::Transaction.

    *   -tx_rollback => *str*

        For more information on transaction, see Rinci::Transaction.

    *   -tx_v => *str*

        For more information on transaction, see Rinci::Transaction.

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element (status) is an integer containing HTTP status code (200
    means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second element (msg) is
