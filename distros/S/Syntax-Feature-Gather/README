NAME
    Syntax::Feature::Gather - Provide a gather keyword

VERSION
    version 1.002001

SYNOPSIS
     use syntax 'gather';

     my @list = gather {
        # Try to extract odd numbers and odd number names...
        for (@data) {
           if (/(one|three|five|seven|nine)$/) { take qq{'$_'} }
           elsif (/^\d+$/ && $_ %2)            { take $_ }
        }
        # But use the default set if there aren't any of either...
        take @defaults unless gathered;
     }

    or to use the stuff that Sub::Exporter gives us, try

     # this is a silly idea
     use syntax gather => {
       gather => { -as => 'bake' },
       take   => { -as => 'cake' },
     };

     my @vals = bake { cake (1...10) };

    The full documentation for this module is in Syntax::Keyword::Gather.
    This is just a way to use the sugar that syntax gives us.
