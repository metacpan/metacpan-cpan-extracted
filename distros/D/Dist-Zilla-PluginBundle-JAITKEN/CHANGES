0.1.6   2014-02-09

    [ BUGFIX ]      
    * Specify the minimum_year as 2007 to get perl v5.10 rather than v5.1.0.1
        Some linux distros patch the base version themselves (Oliver Gorwits)


0.1.5   2013-04-23

    [ FEATURE ]      
    * Add D::Z::P::NameFromDirectory because it's really useful

    [ TESTS ]
    * This is a personal module, I don't need to test it on every perl version ever


0.1.3   2013-01-16

    [ BUGFIX ]      
    * A minimum year of 2010 forces Perl v5.12 - which is not my intention.


0.1.2   2012-09-18

    [ BUGFIX ]      
    * Correctly specify minimum_perl version as a v-string.


0.1.1   2012-09-17

    [ FEATURE ]      
    * Add D::Z::P::PrereqsClean defaulting to perl v5.10
        Perl v5.10 is the minimum version I can reasonably support

    * Add D::Z::P::MinimumPrereqs defaulting to 2010
        This is the year Perl v5.12 was released
