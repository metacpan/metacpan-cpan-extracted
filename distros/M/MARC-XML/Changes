Revision history for Perl extension MARC-XML

1.0.3 Thu Jan 23 05:02:52 UTC 2014
       - fix t/external-entities.t to pass on Strawberry

1.0.2 Tue Jan 21 17:18:37 UTC 2014
       - MARC::File::XML will now die upon parsing a record that
         declares an external entity and tries to use it. This
         prevents the potential unwanted disclosure of the contents
         of files on the server by applications that embed this module.
         If, for some reason, an application needs to process MARCXML
         records that contain external entities, set_parser() can be
         used to force the use of an XML::LibXML parser that is
         configured to process external entities.
    
         The issue was reported by John Lightsey.

1.0.1 Fri Feb 15 08:25:04 PST 2013
       - RT#83284: return empty MARC::Record given empty <record/>

1.0  Sun Feb 10 21:32:32 PST 2013
       - Use XML::LibXML rather than XML::SAX to parse MARCXML records.
         This offers a significant speed improvement for record parsing;
         in some tests, parsing time on a large file was reduced by 80%.
         This also avoids problems caused by character encoding bugs in
         XML::SAX::PurePerl.
       - Add method to let client code give MARC::File::XML a shared
         XML::LibXML parser object.

0.93 Fri Feb 11 17:13:02 EST 2011
       - When slurping MARCXML records (e.g., via MARC::Batch), can
         now handle XML files that use a prefix
         to refer to the http://www.loc.gov/MARC21/slim namespace.
       - If trying to parse a MARCXML record that has omitted
         the <record> wrapper element, throw an exception
         with a more meaningful error message.
       - adjusted copyright statement further to meet Debian requirements
         (RT#48333)
       - set license in Makefile.PL
 
0.92 Thu Jul 30 22:37:07 EDT 2009
      - small documentation changes to close RT tickets #48334 and #48333
        filed by Jonathan from Debian world.
      - added license string to META.yml so that CPAN can pick it up

0.91 Tue Jul 28 2009
      - Nixing the stray space (always been there) in the schemaLocation
        attribute for single-record output
      - Properly apply the leader modification for USMARC to signal UTF-8
        encoding.
      - Escape '<', '>', and '&' used as indicator values and subfield labels 
        during XML output (Bill Erickson)
      - CPAN RT#34082: clarify names of header output switches

0.90 Fri Dec 14 2007
      - modifications to MARC::File::SAX to use LocalName rather than Name
        Name can contain a namespace prefix and cause parsing to fail
        Should be ok to rely on LocalName since the parser factory is
        requiring Namespace support?
      - MARC::File::SAX also can build up multiple records now, for use 
        in other SAX contexts like Net::OAI::Harvester. This required
        a few changes in MARC::File::XML as well.

0.88 Wed Nov 28 2007
      - String test for subfield code to avoid dropping $0 (Galen Charlton)

0.88_1 Tue Oct 23 2007
      - Fixed a typo in M::F::X that could be the origin of the test failure(miker)
      - Removed some useless (and confusing) code that
	    throws away some character set mapping information in the 066 (miker)

0.85 Fri Feb 13 2007
      - fixed typo in handling of unimarc w/regard to marc8 (ppoulain)

0.84 Mon Nov 26 2006
      - Fixed UNIMARC encoding detection logic (miker)
	  - Added UNIMARC Authority support (miker) 

0.83 Fri Apr 21 15:19:20 EST 2006
      - remove premature return from close() thanks Jay Luker (exlibris)

0.82 March 4, 2006
      - details unknown :(

0.81  Fri Feb  3 23:29:04 EST 2006
      - minor changes so that diagnostics (when character mappings aren't found)
        will not throw warnings about unitialized variables too.

0.8   Fri Feb  3 22:49:11 EST 2006
      - overhaul by Mike Rylander to use the new MARC::Charset for mapping
        back and forth from marc8 encoding to utf8 encoding
      - Makefile.PL requires v0.9 of MARC::Charset to be installed

0.7   Thu Apr 14 11:54:24 CDT 2005
      - marc2xml uses MARC::Batch in lenient mode, thanks Rob Casson.

      - added marc2xml and xml2marc utilities

0.61  Mon May 09 10:32:55 2004 
      - need to require MARC::Record v1.36 since it renames is_control_tag()
        to is_control_field().

0.6   Sat May 08 02:23:04 2004 
      - rudimentary XML encoding (thanks to Peter Robertson for inquiring 
        about it)

0.53  Mon Dec 01 17:32:01 2003
