NAME

    CPAN::Perl::Releases - Mapping Perl releases on CPAN to the location of
    the tarballs

VERSION

    version 3.34

SYNOPSIS

      use CPAN::Perl::Releases qw[perl_tarballs];
    
      my $perl = '5.14.0';
    
      my $hashref = perl_tarballs( $perl );
    
      print "Location: ", $_, "\n" for values %{ $hashref };

DESCRIPTION

    CPAN::Perl::Releases is a module that contains the mappings of all perl
    releases that have been uploaded to CPAN to the authors/id/ path that
    the tarballs reside in.

    This is static data, but newer versions of this module will be made
    available as new releases of perl are uploaded to CPAN.

FUNCTIONS

    perl_tarballs

      Takes one parameter, a perl version to search for. Returns an hashref
      on success or undef otherwise.

      The returned hashref will have a key/value for each type of tarball.
      A key of tar.gz indicates the location of a gzipped tar file and
      tar.bz2 of a bzip2'd tar file. The values will be the relative path
      under authors/id/ on CPAN where the indicated tarball will be
      located.

        perl_tarballs( '5.14.0' );
      
        Returns a hashref like:
      
        {
          "tar.bz2" => "J/JE/JESSE/perl-5.14.0.tar.bz2",
          "tar.gz" => "J/JE/JESSE/perl-5.14.0.tar.gz"
        }

      Not all perl releases had tar.bz2, but only a tar.gz.

      Perl tarballs may also be compressed using xz and therefore have a
      tar.xz entry.

    perl_versions

      Returns the list of all the perl versions supported by the module in
      ascending order. TRIAL and RC will be lower than an actual release.

    perl_pumpkins

      Returns a sorted list of all PAUSE IDs of Perl pumpkins.
