# extproc_perl configuration

# format: [db:]key value
# directives apply to all database instances in this ORACLE_HOME
# db is an optional database name for database-specific directives
# database-specific directives MUST follow global ones if they co-exist
# database name is case insensitive
# comment out all empty settings with a hash (#)
#
# GLOBAL & DATABASE CONFIGURATION EXAMPLE:
# bootstrap_file /tmp/boot.pl
# db1:bootstrap_file /tmp/db1-boot.pl

# path to bootstrap file
bootstrap_file -BOOTSTRAP-

# name of the code table, including schema if it is not a public synonym
code_table -CODETABLE-

# additions to perl's include path (@INC) -- colon separated
#inc_path 

# path to debug output directory
debug_directory /tmp

# use taint checking -- this applies globally to all subroutines
# HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
enable_tainting yes

# use per-session namespaces
enable_session_namespace yes

# allow fully-qualified subroutine names in Perl.func & Perl.proc
# this lets you run any subroutine in any imported package, regardless of
# its existence as in the code table or bootstrap file.  Very useful for
# development.  Not recommended for production.
enable_package_subs no

# path to trusted directory that contains imported code files
trusted_code_directory -TRUSTEDDIR-

# format for DDL to create directly executed procedures
# standard: outputs a CREATE statement you can run directly from sqlplus
# package: outputs DDL for a package body
ddl_format standard

# maximum code size per subroutine in bytes
# must be less than or equal to max size of CLOB (4 GB)
# allocated once per interpreter
max_code_size 32768

# maximum arguments to a subroutine (<=  system max, which is usually 128)
# there is currently no benefit to tuning this
max_sub_args 32

# check code table for changes at each subroutine invocation and reparse
# any changed subroutines.  adds a bit of overhead, but good for development.
reparse_subs yes
