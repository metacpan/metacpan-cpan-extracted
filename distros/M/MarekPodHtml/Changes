0.45 marek Wed Oct 23 14:46:50 MEST 2002
  - fixes/enhancements requested by Mark Overmeer <Mark  at  Overmeer.net>:
  * option -stylesheet <link> to include a CSS
  * fixed bug that turned a normal text paragraph into a verbatim one
  * option -idxopt <options> to switch on/off index items
  * Allow L<page/xxx> to X<xxx> in page.pod
  - added some documentation and test
  - fix spurious links to toc/idx if they are not generated
  - -verbose switch now deserves its name (default is off)
  - decent Pod documentation in mpod2html
  - updated documentation wrt. the package name (Marek:: namespace)
    as this probably will not make it into the core as the
    replacement for Pod::HTML

0.44 marek Fri Oct 12 12:30:35 MET DST 2001
  - added paragraph for
     =item * some text
  - one more test added

  - removed spurious <br> after <li>something
  - fixed some HTML::Element->new()
  - mpod2html in filter mode now omits navigation by default
  - added a few TODO items
  - DOCTYPE is now root element

0.42 marek Mon Dec  4 10:10:05 MET 2000
  - updated prerequisites to current versions on CPAN
  - enabled parsing of HTML comments in =for/=begin html
  - changed creation of <P> tags: now every text paragraph is in its own
    <P> with proper start/end tags (<P>...</P>)
  - =for/=begin do *not* introduce separate paragraphs in the output.
    Give your own <P>...</P> if you like separate paragraphs
  - thanks to Raphael Manfredi <Raphael_ManfrediATpobox.com> for these
    valuable suggestions
