BUILDING

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install (if the tests look okay)

PROBLEMS

  1. Perl version is older than 5.005
    The package uses operator qr, which was introduced in 5.005
    If you have older perl versions, follow the instructions inside Table.pm.
    The instructions are started with '###', three steps in total --
    comment out two lines, uncomment one line.

    Instructions in Table.pm looks like the following:

       ### comment out next line if your perl version < 5.005 ###
       $r = ($caseIgn)?qr/$s/i : qr/$s/;

       ### comment out the next line if your perl version < 5.005
       if ($elm =~ /$r/) {
       ### uncomment the next line if your perl version < 5.005
       # if ($elm =~ /$s/ || ($elm=~ /$s/i && $caseIgn)) {
