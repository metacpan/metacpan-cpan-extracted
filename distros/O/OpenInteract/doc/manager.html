<h1>Illustrated Manager's Guide to OpenInteract</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p align="center"><img src="diagram.png" alt="OpenInteract flow"></p>

<P>
OpenInteract implements a mod_perl content handler (2) that takes all requests.
It parses the URL and maps it to a module (1) which will generate the content
for the page. (That module can in turn call any number of other modules,
but that's getting into details.)

<P>
The content handler calls separate modules to parse cookies, create a
session to compensate for the stateless http request paradigm, and ensures
that the user is properly authenticated (3). It passes the module information
to the user interface handler, which calls the module and puts it into the
site template so every page looks the same (4).

<P>
OpenInteract also handlers errors in a uniform fashion, enables database
connection pooling, and manages user interface elements (colors, fonts and
otherwise) through a web interface.

<P>
<H2>Configuration</H2>

<P>
Configuration of OpenInteract is done through human-readable and
editable text files (formatted as Perl). This also
enables each configuration file to be brief and to the point.

<p>There are two levels of configuration files:

<ol>

 <li><b>Website configuration</b>: Allows you to define database
 connection parameters, caching directives, session management and
 related information for a particular website. The information in this
 file is always available to all packages within a website and is
 represented by the <code>OpenInteract::Config</code> object. See the
 <a href="sample-server-ini.html">sample server.ini</a> for the
 specific configuration directives.
 
 <li><b>Package configuration</b>: For an individual package, see the
 <a href="sample-action-perl.html">sample action.perl</a> referenced
 as (1) in the diagram and the <a href="sample-spops-perl.html">sample
 spops.perl</a> referenced as (3) in the diagram.

</ol>
 
<P>
<H2><A NAME="TEMPLATES">Templates</A></H2>
<P>
Just about everything you <em>see</em> as a user looking at an
OpenInteract website is a template. Templates provide a way to put the
"values" of objects into HTML pages. (This is done using the Template
Toolkit, a standard Perl module available from CPAN.)

<p>If a user wants to affect some object (edit, remove, create), he
does so by clicking and pointing at things in the browser. The browser
shows the HTML resulting from a processed template (4). So all
standard techniques for user interaction through a web growser (e.g.,
Javascript, forms, links, upload fields, etc.) are available in
OpenInteract by creating appropriate templates.

<p>You can use any existing tools for creating the templates -- HTML
editors, etc. You can also do simple online editing through the
OpenInteract template editing tool in the web browser.

<p>It is important to understand that in OpenInteract templates are
the only way to expose data (as objects) to the user. From a user
point of view, all OpenInteract does is put objects into
templates. (Obviously, there is a lot more going on in the background,
but this is a useful way of looking at things.)

<H2>Themes</H2>
<P>
The appearance of an OpenInteract application is almost entirely
controlled by a theme. A theme defines the appearance of background
colors, fonts, border colors of boxes, and standard graphical elements
like bullets, etc. Themes implement the notion of "style sheets" in
OpenInteract. (This is not to be confused with Cascading Style Sheets,
which are a different means to control the appearance of raw HTML.)

<p>You can define as many themes as you like, inheriting most
attributes from a parent theme and only overriding a few. Setting the
theme to be used is as simple as a few clicks, and you can develop
themes behind the scenes, testing out and tweaking the appearance,
then rolling it out for everyone.

<H2><A NAME="USERS_AND_GROUPS">Access Control: Users And Groups</A></H2>

<P>
Besides storing your objects in a database and displaying them to the
user, OpenInteract provides a very simple, flexible and standard
scheme of access control by way of users and groups. The scheme is
characterized by the following (those in the know will recognize this
as the Unix way of doing things):

<UL>
<LI>The user with user_id 1 is the superuser, and the group with
group_id 1 is the supergroup. The superuser and the members of the
supergroup can do anything and see anything
<LI>A user can belong to more than one group.
<LI>A user cannot belong to a group for which he/she does not have
read access.
</UL>

<P>
That's it.

<H2>Security</H2>

<p>There are two levels of security in OpenInteract: data security and
action security. Data security is described extensively in the
documentation of the SPOPS interface layer. (See this using the System
Documentation tool in your OpenInteract website or via the command
line with <code>perldoc SPOPS</code>.)

<P>Enabling an object to use security is as simple as a few lines in
the SPOPS configuration file (<code>spops.perl</code>, see
above). Afterward, you can set the security for the entire world, or
on a per-group and per-user basis. Each user and group can have
specific permissions to an object, and the most specific permission is
always utilized.

<P>
The SPOPS security model is also utilized for actions, not just
objects. For instance, you might want to establish a policy that
states all users who are not logged in can view events, but they
cannot add new ones. This implements the notion of "policies" in
OpenInteract and defined at the handler level (2).


<H2>Error Handling</H2>

<P>
OpenInteract has a fairly robust error handling system that allows certain
errors to simply be logged into the system, others to trigger a
notification to an administrator or module author, and others to change
what the user sees onscreen.

<P>
In addition, OpenInteract comes with a very capable error browsing
package that allows you to filter errors by date or type, making it
easy to pinpoint problems in your website.
