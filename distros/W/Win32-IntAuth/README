Win32-IntAuth version 0.12
==========================

This module encapsulates (with Win32::API) the SSPI-API functions that are necessary
to authenticate and impersonate remote users from an already existing
session without additional specification of username and password.

The used Security Package is always 'Negotiate'.

The module does not handle transport of the created user token to the
server process or service nor does it provide routines for further
evaluation of user rights or group memberships.

The outline provided in the synopsis should be enough to get you
started. For details please look at the SSPI docs at:
