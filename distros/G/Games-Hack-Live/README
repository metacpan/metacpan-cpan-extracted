EXAMPLE - using keepvalueat


As an example I'll be taking "craft"; debian version 3.5-12, a "Warcraft 2-like 
multi-player real-time strategy game".

Start it with
	$ hack-live craft

The script outputs a prompt "--->", and starts "craft".

Choose some settings, and start the game.
You'll be starting with money=1000, wood=1000.

Build a town-hall, and send the other worker to dig somewhere; you'll have 
995 money left.

Enter a search command into the script 
	---> find 995

and it will give you
	Searching for e3030000
  found at 0xa7690870 (0xa6dfd000 + 0x893870): e3030000e6030000
	found at 0xa76908d4 (0xa6dfd000 + 0x8938d4): e3030000e6030000

	Most wanted:
		0xA7690870(1)  0xA76908D4(1)  0x00000000(0)  0x00000000(0)  0x00000000(0)  0x00000000(0)

As you'll see, craft uses two memory location to know how much money you 
have. Now we'll get us some; enter

	---> keepvalueat 0xA7690870 20000 "money"
	---> keepvalueat 0xA76908D4 20000 "money2"


Now we want to have more wood, too.

Clear the search cache:
	---> cleanup
	---> find 198

	Searching for c6000000

As you can see, the wood is not so easy.
So you send a worker harvesting wood, as when he has delivered:
	---> find 298
	Searching for 2a010000
		found at 0x08b5ee94 (0x080f6000 + 0xa68e94): 2a01000003000200

		found at 0x08b5eff4 (0x080f6000 + 0xa68ff4): 2a01000003000200
		found at 0xa7690874 (0xa6dfd000 + 0x893874): 2a010000c88b16d9

		found at 0xa76f6f6c (0xa6dfd000 + 0x8f9f6c): 2a0100002b010000

	Most wanted:
		0xA76908D8(2)  0xA7690874(2)  0x08C27114(1)  0x08C266FE(1)  
		0x08B5EE94(1)  0xA7B9AA50(1)

So now only two locations are left, and we set them:

	---> keepvalueat 0xA76908D8 20000 "wood"
	---> keepvalueat 0xA7690874 20000 "wood2"


Finished!

Now you can play your game, and when you stop the script with CTRL-D you 
will get the finished output.

Please note that craft won't be stopped - but as the debugger quits, too, 
the money and wood will no longer be kept at their values!

	# keeping "money" (0xA7690870) at 0x4e20 (20000):
					set *(int*)0xA7690870=20000
					watch *(int*)0xA7690870
					commands
					silent
					set *(int*)0xA7690870=20000
					c
					end

	# keeping "money2" (0xA76908D4) at 0x4e20 (20000):
					set *(int*)0xA76908D4=20000
					watch *(int*)0xA76908D4
					commands
					silent
					set *(int*)0xA76908D4=20000
					c
					end

	# keeping "wood" (0xA76908D8) at 0x4e20 (20000):
					set *(int*)0xA76908D8=20000
					watch *(int*)0xA76908D8
					commands
					silent
					set *(int*)0xA76908D8=20000
					c
					end

	# keeping "wood2" (0xA7690874) at 0x4e20 (20000):
					set *(int*)0xA7690874=20000
					watch *(int*)0xA7690874
					commands
					silent
					set *(int*)0xA7690874=20000
					c
					end

These are the commands that GDB needs to keep the money and wood at the 
wanted 20000.


EXAMPLE - using killwrites

You start the game and find the memory locations and before; but instead of 
the keepvalueat commands you enter the killwrites commands:

	---> find 995

	Searching for e3030000
		found at 0xa767f870 (0xa6dec000 + 0x893870): e3030000e6030000
		found at 0xa767f8d4 (0xa6dec000 + 0x8938d4): e3030000e6030000

	Most wanted:
		0xA767F8D4(1)  0xA767F870(1)  0x00000000(0)  0x00000000(0)  0x00000000(0)  0x00000000(0)
	---> killwrites 0xA767F8D4 "money1"
	---> killwrites 0xA767F870 "money2"

	---> cleanup
	---> find 998
	Searching for e6030000
		found at 0xa767f874 (0xa6dec000 + 0x893874): e6030000a93108ac
		found at 0xa767f8d8 (0xa6dec000 + 0x8938d8): e6030000a93108ac

	Most wanted:
		0xA767F874(1)  0xA767F8D8(1)  0x00000000(0)  0x00000000(0)  0x00000000(0)  0x00000000(0)
	---> killwrites 0xA767F874 "wood1"
	---> killwrites 0xA767F8D8 "wood2"


And you're finished again. Please note that this will keep *changes* from 
happening - so you might not be able to acquire more wood or money, because 
the writes get killed ...
In this case it might be better to set a new value *before* killing all 
writes - to avoid having not enough money to buy things.
This you can do with
	---> set *(int*)0xA767F8D4=20000
	---> set *(int*)0xA767F870=20000
	---> set *(int*)0xA767F874=20000
	---> set *(int*)0xA767F8D8=20000


After quitting the script you'll get again the fruits of your labor:

	# stopped at 0x8082df2 for "wood1" (at 0xa767f874); killing command "mov %eax,0x9c86c(%edx)" via
		set *(short*)(0x8082dec)=0x04eb

	# stopped at 0x80be6cf for "wood2" (at 0xa767f8d8); killing command "mov %edx,0x9c8d0(%eax)" via
		set *(short*)(0x80be6c9)=0x04eb

	...

These are the commands to patch your (running) craft binary.
