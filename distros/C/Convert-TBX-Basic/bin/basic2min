=head1 NAME

basic2min - Convert a TBX-Basic file into TBX-Min

=head1 VERSION

version 0.03

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  % basic2min file.tbx en fr 2>log.txt

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This script takes three arguments: the name of a TBX-Basic file and
source and target language abreviations indicating which languages
to extract from the file. Relevant terms are extracted from the file
and a TBX::Min document is printed to standard out. All logs are
printed to stderr.

=head1 SEE ALSO
This script is a simple wrapper around the C<basic2min>
function in L<Convert::TBX::Basic>.
