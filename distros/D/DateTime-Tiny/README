DESCRIPTION
    DateTime::Tiny is a most prominent member of the DateTime::Tiny suite of
    time modules.

    It implements an extremely lightweight object that represents a
    datetime.

  The Tiny Mandate
    Many CPAN modules which provide the best implementation of a certain
    concepts are very large. For some reason, this generally seems to be
    about 3 megabyte of ram usage to load the module.

    For a lot of the situations in which these large and comprehensive
    implementations exist, some people will only need a small fraction of
    the functionality, or only need this functionality in an ancillary role.

    The aim of the Tiny modules is to implement an alternative to the large
    module that implements a useful subset of their functionality, using as
    little code as possible.

    Typically, this means a module that implements between 50% and 80% of
    the features of the larger module (although this is just a guideline),
    but using only 100 kilobytes of code, which is about 1/30th of the
    larger module.

  The Concept of Tiny Date and Time
    Due to the inherent complexity, Date and Time is intrinsically very
    difficult to implement properly.

    The arguably only module to implement it completely correct is DateTime.
    However, to implement it properly DateTime is quite slow and requires
    3-4 megabytes of memory to load.

    The challenge in implementing a Tiny equivalent to DateTime is to do so
    without making the functionality critically flawed, and to carefully
    select the subset of functionality to implement.

    If you look at where the main complexity and cost exists, you will find
    that it is relatively cheap to represent a date or time as an object,
    but much much more expensive to modify, manipulate or convert the
    object.

    As a result, DateTime::Tiny provides the functionality required to
    represent a date as an object, to stringify the date and to parse it
    back in, but does not allow you to modify the dates.

    The purpose of this is to allow for date object representations in
    situations like log parsing and fast real-time type work.

    The problem with this is that having no ability to modify date limits
    the usefulness greatly.

    To make up for this, if you have DateTime installed, any DateTime::Tiny
    module can be inflated into the equivalent DateTime as needing, loading
    DateTime on the fly if necessary.

    This is somewhat similar to DateTime::LazyInit, but unlike that module
    DateTime::Tiny objects are not modifiable.

    For the purposes of date/time logic, all DateTime::Tiny objects exist in
    the "C" locale, and the "floating" time zone. This may be improved in
    the future if a suitably tiny way of handling timezones is found.

    When converting up to full DateTime objects, these locale and time zone
    settings will be applied (although an ability is provided to override
    this).

    In addition, the implementation is strictly correct and is intended to
    be very easily to sub-class for specific purposes of your own.

USAGE
    In general, the intent is that the API be as close as possible to the
    API for DateTime. Except, of course, that this module implements less of
    it.

METHODS
  new
      my $date = DateTime::Tiny->new(
          year   => 2006,
          month  => 12,
          day    => 31,
          hour   => 10,
          minute => 45,
          second => 32,
          );

    The "new" constructor creates a new DateTime::Tiny object.

    It takes six named parameters. "day" should be the day of the month
    (1-31), "month" should be the month of the year (1-12), "year" as a 4
    digit year. "hour" should be the hour of the day (0-23), "minute" should
    be the minute of the hour (0-59) and "second" should be the second of
    the minute (0-59).

    These are the only parameters accepted.

    Returns a new DateTime::Tiny object.

  now
      my $current_date = DateTime::Tiny->now;

    The "now" method creates a new date object for the current date.

    The date created will be based on localtime, despite the fact that the
    date is created in the floating time zone.

    Returns a new DateTime::Tiny object.

  year
    The "year" accessor returns the 4-digit year for the date.

  month
    The "month" accessor returns the 1-12 month of the year for the date.

  day
    The "day" accessor returns the 1-31 day of the month for the date.

  hour
    The "hour" accessor returns the hour component of the time as an integer
    from zero to twenty-three (0-23) in line with 24-hour time.

  minute
    The "minute" accessor returns the minute component of the time as an
    integer from zero to fifty-nine (0-59).

  second
    The "second" accessor returns the second component of the time as an
    integer from zero to fifty-nine (0-59).

  ymdhms
    The "ymdhms" method returns the most common and accurate stringified
    date format, which returns in the form "2006-04-12T23:59:59".

  from_string
    The "from_string" method creates a new DateTime::Tiny object from a
    string.

    The string is expected to be an ISO 8601 combined date and time, with
    separators (including the 'T' separator) and no time zone designator. No
    other ISO 8601 formats are supported.

      my $almost_midnight = DateTime::Tiny->from_string( '2006-12-20T23:59:59' );

    Returns a new DateTime::Tiny object, or throws an exception on error.

  as_string
    The "as_string" method converts the date to the default string, which at
    present is the same as that returned by the "ymdhms" method above.

    This string conforms to the ISO 8601 standard for the encoding of a
    combined date and time as a string, without time-zone designator.

  DateTime
    The "DateTime" method is used to create a DateTime object that is
    equivalent to the DateTime::Tiny object, for use in conversions and
    calculations.

    As mentioned earlier, the object will be set to the 'C' locale, and the
    'floating' time zone.

    If installed, the DateTime module will be loaded automatically.

    Returns a DateTime object, or throws an exception if DateTime is not
    installed on the current host.

HISTORY
    This module was written by Adam Kennedy in 2006. In 2016, David Golden
    adopted it as a caretaker maintainer.
