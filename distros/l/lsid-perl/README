lsid-perl version 1.1.4
=======================

* ABOUT

This module implements an object-oriented interface for building clients
and servers that resolve LSIDs and perform metadata queries on LSIDs.


* What's new in this release

This release contains updates and many bug fixes. Specific issues
resolved:

	- Fixed bug in Perl use statements
	- Minor code style cleanups
        - Documentation updates

This release is based on the specification submitted to the Object
Management Group (OMG) and is not compatible with all previous releases.
Clients and authorities based on previous versions should still
interoperate with minimal changes to each. Most changes involve port
types and the addition of a Services WSDL document that describes how to
invoke the authority. Please see the examples/ for more information.


* IMPORTANT: You need SOAP::Lite 0.60a installed for this release. You should 
			 also install File::Temp from CPAN as the File::Temp included
			 with Perl is not sufficient for this module.




* MODIFICATIONS TO AUTHORITIES

This release modifies how ports are added to authorities. The OLD method
of adding ports should still work. However the new method is much cleaner:

NOTE: $authority is a LS::Service::Authority object reference

$authority->addMetadataPort(
	serviceName=> 'myService',
	endpoint=> "$location/authority/metadata",
	protocol=> $LS::Authority::WSDL::Constants::Protocols::SOAP,
	);

$authority->addDataPort(
	serviceName=> 'myService',
	endpoint=> "$location/authority/data",
	protocol=> $LS::Authority::WSDL::Constants::Protocols::SOAP,
	);

Notice the 'serviceName' and 'protocol' parameters. We recommend 
that you use different service names for each protocol. For example, 
if you have SOAP and HTTP ports for metadata, add each port to 
a service named for its respective protocol (ie. authoritySOAP 
or authorityHTTP).




FEATURES



* LSID Assigning Service

This release provides a client and the necessary framework for
implementing an LSID Assigning Service. See examples/assigning for more
information about how to use the framework and client.


* Foreign Authority Notification service

The LSID Authority framework has been updated to support FAN. See
rfcfan.txt for more information about FAN.


* Authority Framework

The Authority framework has been moved to LS::Service and underwent
significant changes. In many cases, crating a SOAP based authority
has become easier. See the examples/ subdirectory for two authority
examples.



* Caching

The cache modules have been updated to return LS::Service::Response
objects containing IO::File objects in the response.

The client stack now caches all metadata, data and WSDL queries. The
default path is stored in /tmp/lsid-client and can be change through
then evironment variable LSID_CACHE_ROOT.



DEPENDENCIES

lsid-perl requires these other modules and libraries:

SOAP-Lite-0.60a
URI-1.21
libwww-perl-5.53
Net::FTP 2.65
Net-DNS-0.28
XML-XPath-1.12
MIME-Base64-2.12
File::Temp 0.12 (Install from CPAN, File::Temp in the Perl distribution is not enough)
RDF-Core-0.30
MIME-tools >6.100 (Needed for Apache AXIS compatibility)

This module is known to work with the versions given, but later and
earlier ones may also work.



INSTALLATION

lsid-perl can be installed like any Perl module found on CPAN. In short:

On Unix or Linux:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install
   
On Windows:

Download the nmake utility from
ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/Softlib/MSLFILES/nmake15.exe, then

   perl Makefile.PL
   nmake
   nmake test
   nmake install

OR

   Copy LS.pm and the LS folder into your Perl's lib directory. You can
   find the lib directory by typing

    perl -e 'print "@INC"'
