Revision history for Perl extension FormMagick.
0.88
----
* License clarification on all files. FormMagick is licensed under the
  same terms as perl itself.
* Trim blank space around lexicon entries
* Textarea fields can now have "rows" and "cols" arguments instead of size
  and generate proper HTML
* UI changes to make using CSS easier
* Improved email address parsing using Mail::RFC822::Address module
* Security fix: force use of session dir for tokens, don't pass full path

0.87
----
An HTML error (missing > symbol) was making the script print only the
first error message if a field was failing more than one validation.

0.86
----
Nothing user-visible.
There is now a get_validation_attribute routine in Validator.pm to help
me with a subclass we're using at e-smith.

0.85
----
Fixed bug with charsets when displaying values in text fields.  It's a
long story.  Ugh.

0.84
----
Fixed insidious, nasty little display bug that caused certain form
elements to show weird character sets.  Bleh.

0.83
----
Various minor bugfixes.  See CVS.  I'm in a hurry.

0.82
----
Fixed up various warnings that were thrown to the httpd error log.

Templated form headers/footers are now untainted automatically.  Note 
that this could be considered a security problem; suggestions on how to
handle it more securely would be welcomed.  (See the parse_template
routine in CGI::FormMagick::Utils if you're interested.)

0.81
----
Now fails more gracefully on XML errors, dumping the XML to a file in
/tmp as a side effect

You can now specify the default XML character set encoding as an
argument to new() (defaults to undef).  In future versions this should
be changed to work on a per-lexicon basis, but for now we will use this
stopgap measure.

Fixed a bug which was causing fallback_language not to work.

0.80
----
Langtags are now smashed to lowercase throughout.

0.79
----
Added lexicon params, for variable interpolation in l10n'd strings.

0.78
----
Added "literal" field type.

0.77
----
Added accessor method $fm->cgi()

Added convenience function $fm->wherenext() to set the magic wherenext
variable for skipping pages etc.

0.75
----

Support for language dialects.  L10N for something like en-US will now
work.

Some minor documentation patches.

Fixed some weirdness with validate_field() so that its return values can
be successfully L10N'd.

0.70
----

URLs generated for form submission, start over link, etc, are now
relative.

The following things, which have always run a subroutine if the input
contained parens, eg foo(), now also accept arguments to those
subroutines, eg foo("bar", "baz"):

    Form pre/post events
    Page pre/post events
    Field values
    Subroutine elements

Multiple lexicons for the same language are now merged, with the later
entries overwriting the former.

You can now set a fallback language for localisation, using the
fallback_language() method.

0.60
----

WARNING: BREAKS BACKWARDS COMPATIBILITY AGAIN.  LOTS.

Changed all XML elements and attributes, and parameters to new(), to
lower case.  For instance, <FORM...> is now <form...>

All external routines called by FM, including pre- and post-events and
validation routines, now have the FormMagick object passed to them as
their first parameter.  This will break any existing validation, 
pre/post routines, etc.

Fixed a small bug where field values of "0" would not be preserved.

Documentation fixes.

MAJOR CHANGES, WARNING WARNING AWOOGA AWOOGA.  THIS RELEASE BREAKS
BACKWARDS COMPATIBILITY LOTS.

Added HTML and SUBROUTINE elements to allow arbitrary stuff in your
forms.

Added LEXICON element so that l10n now happens right in your XML.
Removed all Locale::Maketext stuff.

OPTIONS which are hashes (either from a subroutine or static) now sort
by value rather than key.

CHECKBOX values now default to "1" if you don't set them, and retain
their state when navigating back and forth.

Added validation routine(s):
    Network         mac_address()

Improved taint-friendliness.

0.50
----

Various code cleanups.

Added experimental file upload support.

Changed email() validation routine to email_simple()

OO interface to previousbutton() and friends

More taint-friendly

Starting to deprecate Locale::Maketext in favour of XML-based lexicons

0.49
----

New numbering scheme (CPAN-friendly).

Lots of internal fixes, shouldn't be visible to users.

Lots of stuff has been moved out to sub-modules such as
CGI::FormMagick::Setup etc.  Most of this should be irrelevant and
invisible to users.

One visible bugfix: there were problems with i18n and the "Next" button
because we were looking for the literal string "Next".  This has been
fixed.

0.4.1
-----
Fixed a small bug which caused SELECT MULTIPLE fields with no SIZE to
have their size default to only showing one item.

0.4.0
-----
Error messages now appear near the fields to which they apply, and can
be prettified using the "error" class in a cascading style sheet.

A new parameter to the new() method, SESSIONDIR, allows the user to
specify where they want their session-handling tokens to be put.

The parameters PREVIOUSBUTTON, RESETBUTTON and STARTOVERLINK, when given
to new(), allow you to switch off these buttons/links.  They default to
being on.

New validation routines now working:
	password()
	credit_card_number()
	credit_card_expiry()

Validation module no longer requires Business::CreditCard

Major reworking and bug-fixing of the flow between pages when clicking
Next/Previous/etc, including passing round a stack of all previous pages
visited.

Fixes to validation, including stuff that allows you to validate stuff
by hand if you want.

SELECT MULTIPLE is now supported.

SIZE is now supported for TEXT and SELECT form elements.

0.3.1
-----
Added stub L10N perl modules for every language in iso639.  This means
that add_lexicon() now works for *any* real language.

Added some tools to assist developers in generating L10N translations.

A couple of very small bugfixes.

0.3.0
-----
Renamed to CGI::FormMagick

Changes to DTD:
Optional CHECKED attribute on FIELD

Validation changes:
user-supplied routines now work
much improved docco

Other changes:
You can now use TYPE => "STRING" as well as "FILE"
RADIO buttons now implemented
CHECKBOX now implemented

0.2.9
-----
Made FormMagick CPAN-friendly.

Changes to DTD:
NAME attriute on PAGE element is now required
optional DESCRIPTION attribute for PAGE and FIELD elements

Validation changes:
domain_name routine now works

L10N changes:
You can now add items to the lexicon with the add_lexicon method

Debugging:
Adding DEBUG => 1 to your new() call will turn debugging on
You can use debug messages yourself with $fm->debug($message)

Look and feel:
You can now put DESCRIPTION attributes on your pages and/or fields, and
   they'll show up nicely output in the HTML.
Most parts of the form now have CSS "label" attriutes so you can
   change the look and feel of your FormMagick apps

Other functionality changes:
Page pre/post events now work
Form post events now work
You can use form post events to "branch" to a page other than the
   next one in line by setting $cgi's "wherenext" param
when calling the new() method, TYPE now defaults to "file" and SOURCE
   to the same filename as your script but with a .xml extension

Examples:
A worked example of collecting email retrieval options for the e-smith
server and gateway system is included in examples/e-smith/
