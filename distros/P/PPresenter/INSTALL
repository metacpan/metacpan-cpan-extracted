- INSTALL

Portable Presenter is a fully Perl/Tk compliant package, so as
long as you have compiled a recent Perl and Tk, it should work
`out the box'.

** What do you need?

Install the following packages.  The version-numbers are indications;
it might be that earlier versions work too.
- Perl 5.005_02 or higher
  You can best use the latest stable version, which is located at
  http://www.CPAN.org/src/stable.tar.gz
- Perl/Tk 800.015 or higher  (obligatory)
  http://www.CPAN.org/modules/by-module/Tk/Tk800.015.tar.gz
  Versions 800.016-800.019 are less stable.
- X11::Protocol v0.04        (optional)
  http://www.CPAN.org/modules/by-module/X11/X11-Protocol-0.04.tar.gz

For ImageMagick:       (optional)
http://www.ImageMagick.org
- ImageMagick v4.2.9 and PerlMagick v4.29   Other version will work
  too, as long as the ImageMagick and PerlMagick versions match!  This
  is wrong for some Linux Distributions.
  Newer versions of ImageMagick will work too.

You can best compile Perl and Perl/Tk yourself (best chance that it will
work together).  For ImageMagick, the binary distribution is linked to
most image libraries: that's quite a lot of work to collect yourself.

You may want to have a look at the manual how to improve your X-fonts:

** Installing this package.

Unpack the package (hey! you did of course, otherwise you wouldn't
be able to read this messsage) with, and install:

   gzip -d < PPresenter-v*.tar.gz | tar xf -
   cd PPresenter-v?.??
   perl Makefile.PL
   make install

This package does not contain any binaries.  You can install, upgrade
or remove the other packages without the need to reinstall PPresenter.

** Warning

WARNING:
   Do not run PPresenter files which you have downloaded from the Net: they
   are Perl programs, hence can perform any task on your system without
   you noticing it.
   Presentation should be distrubed as websites or postscript.  See the
   export facilities on how to create them.
