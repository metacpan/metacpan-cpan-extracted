--- before the next release-ish

- wrong handling enclosure subelement of item
  http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=21740

--- soon-ish

- Make all the date/time interfaces accept and emit DateTime dates (maybe unix
  timestamps too?) instead of strings

--- eventually

- use a better / more liberal XML parser

- fix skipHour and skipDay methods (bdf: what's wrong with them?)

- rewrite for extendability (base class with a derived one for
  each version)

- auto encode text?

- Investigate parsing multiple dc:items into an array reference when
inside other elements besides an <item>:
    - http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=6000

- Add a way (and an option) to parse module items with duplicate keys into
an array reference.
    - check more edge cases with other than <image> elements.
