Revision history for XML-MyXML

1.02    2018-06-12
        - Add mention of perlmodules.net

1.01    2018-06-12
        - Added mini-tutorial on how to use the simple_to_xml function

1.000   2018-06-08
        - simple_to_xml allows setting attributes, with refs or strings
        - default indentstring changed from tab character to 4 spaces

0.9407  2017-01-12
        - get or set a node's inner_xml, using the method of the same name

0.9406  2017-01-12
        - Fixed compatibility with perl v5.8 again

0.9405  2017-01-12
        - allow user to set the value (aka "text contents") of a node, with $obj->value("text")
        - when getting the value of a node, returns text contents of all descendant nodes as well
        - $obj->text is an alias for $obj->value

0.9404  2016-12-03
        - minor bugfix

0.9403  2016-11-28
        - testing something really unimportant

0.9402  2016-07-26
        - replaced $ in regexes with \z, to slightly improve accuracy of XML parsing
        - publish dist.ini and weaver.ini to CPAN

0.9401  2016-07-06
        Fixed leftover mistakes in the documentation

0.9400  2016-07-06
        BREAKING CHANGE: XML documents parsed or produced by this module are character strings, rather than
            bytes/octets. This is in order to follow the convention explained by Ricardo Signes here:
            https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmTeXcEixEg
            An optional 'bytes' function flag changes that behaviour
        Added $obj->parent method

0.9010  2016-07-04
        In path method, allow surrounding attr value with quotes

0.9009  2016-07-03
        path method can now follow multiple paths to target elements

0.9008  2016-03-31
        Minor optimization in speed

0.9007  2015-05-26
        Add "provides" clause in META.yml, META.json files

0.9006  2014-07-06
        Replaced Test::Deep::cmp_deeply with Test::More::is_deeply
        Removed the only non-core dependency from the prereqs (Test::Deep)

0.9005  2014-06-24
        Fixed bug where just $obj->path('/root-tag') wouldn't return the root element

0.9004  2014-06-24
        The path parameter of the $obj->path method can now also include the root element inside it, if preceeded with a slash
            e.g. $obj->path('/root-tag/child-tag/grandchild-tag')

0.9003  2014-06-15
        On error, all functions now 'croak' rather than 'confess'

0.9002  2014-04-11
        Improved documentation, with an example
        Fixed documentation (added 'xml_escape' in the list of exportable methods)

0.9001  2014-03-04
        Made Changes file compliant
        Fixed bug where it wasn't possible to have two entities resolving to the same string

0.9000  2014-03-04
        BREAKING CHANGES:
        XML::MyXML has changed to work like XML::MyXML::II. This means:
            Better unicode support (all strings except XML docs themselves, will contain characters instead of bytes/octets)
            Removed the 'utf8' and 'soft' options from methods and functions that used them
            Created objects that go out of scope are automatically destroyed (and also removed the $obj->delete method)
            $obj->tag doesn't by default strip the namespace from the returned tagname
            XML::MyXML::II doesn't exist anymore
        Also fixed the rare double-decoding bug (bug #1 on github)
        The interface looks stable, so preparing for v1.0 release

0.1003  2014-02-01
        Issue a warning if a user uses XML::MyXML instead of XML::MyXML::II

0.1002  2013-09-10
        Made it compatible with Perl 5.8 again

0.1001  2013-09-02
        Fixed documentation of XML::MyXML a bit

0.1000  2013-09-02
        Created XML::MyXML::II to replace the deprecated XML::MyXML which won't be maintained anymore. Differences are the following:
        Better unicode support (all strings except XML docs themselves, will contain characters instead of bytes/octets)
        Removed the 'utf8' and 'soft' options from methods and functions that used them
        Created objects that go out of scope are automatically destroyed (and also removed the $obj->delete method)
        $obj->tag doesn't by default strip the namespace from the returned tagname

0.0993  2013-08-13
        Quickly changed name of ent_encode function to the more correct 'xml_escape'

0.09921 2013-08-12
        Re-releasing because of a mistake I made in the release process previously

0.0992  2013-08-12
        Prepared this module for KJabberd. More specifically:
        simple_to_xml now returns empty elements correctly (<el/>)
        $obj->tag now optionally doesn't strip the namespace
        paths may contain attrs, like in CSS3 selectors
        added $el->cmp_element('tag[attr=val]') method (returns 1 or 0)
        allow setting of attributes

0.0991  2013-04-07
        Test some file reading/writing functions of the module as well

0.0990  2013-03-28

        Include $! in error messages when open fails
        Remove the '&' symbol from function calls
        Include all of the dependencies (including Perl version) in the META files

0.0989  2013-03-23
        Wrote basic tests
        Use the 3-param syntax for 'open' (for read & write)

0.0988  2013-03-21
        Switched from using filehandle globs (like FILE) to ordinary scalars (like $fh)

0.0987  2013-03-11
        Switched to Dist::Zilla

0.098061 2007-08-10
        Minor modification in the documentation to describe change in version 0.09806

0.09806 2007-08-10
        XML documents to be parsed may be encoded either in UTF-8 or in some other encoding provided this encoding is declared in the XML declaration ( <?xml ... encoding="..." ?> ) in the beginning of the document

0.09805 2007-07-27
        Slight improvements to the $obj->delete method and to garbage-colection throughout the module

0.098   2007-07-26
        Added the $obj->delete method that will clear the memory of an object (needed because an object and its children refer to each other circularly)

0.09766 2007-04-17
        All functions that parse XML strings will convert string to utf8 if a different encoding is declared in the XML declaration

0.09765 2007-04-17
        Fixed dependencies so tests don't fail

0.09762 2007-04-16
        Some functions now check whether the provided XML is valid utf-8, and produce an error if it's not (having 'soft' flag turned on will return undef in case of invalid utf-8)

0.09761 2007-04-16
        Removed some debugging code

0.0976  2007-04-16

        Fixed bug where simple arrayref structures would get 'consumed' by &simple_to_xml

0.097   2007-03-24
        &simple_to_xml can add xslt declarations in the beginning
        &xml_to_simple and ->simplify can create arrayrefs in addition to hashrefs (arrayrefs preserve order and duplicate elements)
        Fixed bug where &xml_to_object would choke with some symbols in utf8::upgrade'd XML strings

0.0969  2007-03-17
        Fixed bug where simple_to_xml wouldn't accept attributes at the root element
        Fixed XML version in declaration from 1.1 to 1.0

0.0968  2007-03-09
        Added the 'strip_ns' flag, that strips namespaces from tags, on &xml_to_simple and on ->simplify

0.0961  2007-03-07
        Corrected bug where the indentstring flag on &simple_to_xml wouldn't do anything

0.096   2007-03-06
        Added ability for the following functions/methods to save their XML output to a file: &tidy_xml, &object_to_xml, &simple_to_xml, ->to_xml, ->to_tidy_xml
        Added the 'soft' flag to &tidy_xml

0.0951  2007-03-06
        Corrected bug where ->value would double-decode

0.095   2007-03-06

        Added a space before the '?>' mark in the XML declaration introduced in 0.093
        Corrected small bits in documentation

0.093   2007-03-05
        Parser will now ignore all special markup instead of dying on it (except for CDATA sections which it can handle since v0.061)
        XML documents produced with this module may now have an XML declaration in the beginning (<?xml ... ?>)
        Almost all functions and methods accept flags now
        Wrote features & limitations in the documentation
        Wrote a 'function flags' section in the documentation

0.092   2007-03-05
        check_xml, which used to be able to check XML strings only, can now check XML files also
        Added an optional 'soft' mode to xml_to_simple and xml_to_object functions, which returns undef instead of dying in case of error
        Added the :all export tag - imports all exportable functions

0.091   2007-03-04
        xml_to_simple and xml_to_object can now accept a filename for an argument
        Minor alterations in the documentation

0.09    2007-03-03
        simple_to_xml($simple_ref) has been changed to allow the argument to be a hashref, an arrayref or a mixed structure

0.083   2007-03-03
        Changed the way that flags are set. Instead of a string such as 'strip internal', it's with a hashref { strip => 1, internal => 1 }. Module stops execution and informs about the change, if programmer tries to set flags with the old way.

0.082   2007-03-03
        Added optional 'strip' mode for the &xml_to_simple function and the $obj->simplify method, that strips surrounding whitespace from texts
        Added optional 'internal' mode for the $obj->simplify method, that return a hashref only of the contents of the top element

0.081   2007-03-03
        Added an 'internal' mode for the &xml_to_simple function
        Added a 'strip' mode for the ->value method that strips surrounding whitespace

0.08    2007-03-01
        XML-decodes the attribute values when parsing documents, and XML-encodes them when creating XML documents
        Added the ->tag method to XML objects, which retrieves the tag name of the top element
        Minor changes in the documentation

0.076   2007-02-27
        $element->value returns empty string ('') if element is empty, instead of null

0.075   2007-02-25
        Added the ->attr('attr_name') method to XML objects, which retrieves the value of an attribute

0.07    2007-02-25
