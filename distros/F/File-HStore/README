File-HStore version 0.10
========================


File-HStore  is a very  minimalist perl  library to  store files  on a
filesystem using a very simple hash-based storage.

File-HStore  is nothing  more than  a  simple wrapper  interface to  a
storage containing a specific directory structure where files are hold
based on  their hashes. The  name of the  directories is based  on the
first two  bytes of the  hexadecimal form of  the digest. The  file is
stored and named  with its full hexadecimal form  in the corresponding
prefixed directory.

The  current version  is supporting  the  SHA-1 and  SHA-2 (256  bits)
algorithm. The FAT (Free Archive Toolkit) format is also supported and
it is  composed of the date  of submission plus the  SHA-2 real digest
part.
