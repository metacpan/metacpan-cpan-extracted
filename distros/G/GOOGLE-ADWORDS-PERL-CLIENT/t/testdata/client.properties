# An OAuth2 refresh token.
# MCC service tests do not pass a clientCustomerId in the requests and
# instead rely on AdWords finding the gaia account associated with the
# OAuth token. As a result, tests of MCC-related services will fail if
# this token did not come from an MCC.
# Furthermore, tests of non-MCC services will fail if this token is
# from an account that does not have permission to manage the account
# identified by clientId.
#
# Since non-test and test accounts cannot be linked, it
# follows from this that either:
#   clientId is a test account and this token was obtained
#   from a test MCC, in which case tests on MCC services
#   will fail
# or:
#   clientId is a non-test account and this token was obtained
#   from a non-test MCC, in which case tests on MCC services
#   will succeed
