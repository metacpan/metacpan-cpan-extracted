DONATIONS

    If you'd like to thank me (the author, Dave Rolsky) for the work I've
    done on this module, please consider making a "donation" to me via
    PayPal. I spend a lot of free time creating free software, and would
    appreciate any support you'd care to offer.

    Please note that I am not suggesting that you must do this in order for
    me to continue working on this particular software. I will continue to
    do so, inasmuch as I have in the past, for as long as it interests me.

    Similarly, a donation made in this way will probably not make me work
    on this software much more, unless I get so many donations that I can
    consider working on free software full time, which seems unlikely at
    best.

    To donate, log into PayPal and send money to autarch@urth.org or use
    the button on this page: http://www.urth.org/~autarch/fs-donation.html
