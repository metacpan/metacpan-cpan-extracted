0.012     2014-01-11 14:19:46-05:00 America/New_York
        - YAML dumper now uses YAML::XS, as previous bugs (see 0.003) are,
          I think, fixed now; on the other hand, there were some crazy
          B-related bugs in 5.16 and later

0.011     2013-12-31 13:41:12 America/New_York
        - fix some infelicities in email subject and thread id construction

0.010     2013-09-12 09:46:44 America/New_York
        - when the YAML dumper fails to dump, include the reason why

        - simplify code for ident guessing, avoiding newlines in idents

0.008     2013-08-22 20:14:46 America/New_York
        - fix tiny but quite significant documentation error (thanks, Tomohiro
          Hosaka!)

0.007     2013-08-22 17:35:07 America/New_York
        - update bugtracker and repository

        - add abstracts to all modules

0.006     2013-03-18 15:41:35 America/New_York
        - both simplify and improve the ident-generation for Text summarizer

0.005     2013-02-06 12:00:07 America/New_York
        - add the Text dumper to summarize simple strings literally

0.004     2013-01-03 14:39:54 America/New_York

0.003     2012-07-05 15:19:21 America/New_York
