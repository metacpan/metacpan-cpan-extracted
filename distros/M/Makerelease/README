ABOUT

  The makerelease script allows developers to perform an
  partially-automated set of steps that a developer needs to perform in
  order to release their software.  It checks the results at each step
  and prompts the developer with any issues it runs into as it goes
  along.

INSTALLATION

  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make install

HISTORY

  The makerelease script derives in concept from one that was used to
  simplify and standardize the process of releasing the Net-SNMP package.
