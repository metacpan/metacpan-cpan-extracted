NAME

    App::FatPacker::Simple - only fatpack a script

SYNOPSIS

        > fatpack-simple script.pl

DESCRIPTION

    App::FatPacker::Simple or its frontend fatpack-simple helps you fatpack
    a script when YOU understand the whole dependencies of it.

    For tutorial, please look at App::FatPacker::Simple::Tutorial.

MOTIVATION

    App::FatPacker::Simple is an alternative for App::FatPacker's fatpack
    file command. Let me explain why I wrote this module.

    App::FatPacker brings more portability to Perl, that is totally
    awesome.

    As far as I understand, App::FatPacker does 3 things:

    (a) trace dependencies for a script

    (b) collects dependencies to fatlib directory

    (c) fatpack the script with modules in fatlib

    As for (a), I have often encountered problems. For example, modules
    that I don't want to trace trace, conversely, modules that I DO want to
    trace do not trace. Moreover a core module has changed interfaces or
    has been bug-fixed recently, so we have to fatpack that module with new
    version, etc. So I think if you author intend to fatpack a script, YOU
    need to understand the whole dependencies of it.

    As for (b), to locate modules in a directory, why don't you use carton
    or cpanm?

    So the rest is (c) to fatpack a script with modules in directories, on
    which App::FatPacker::Simple concentrates.

    That is, App::FatPacker::Simple only fatpacks a script with features:

      * automatically perl-strip modules

      * has option to exclude some modules
