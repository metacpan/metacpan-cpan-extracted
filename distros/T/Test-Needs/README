NAME
    Test::Needs - Skip tests when modules not available

SYNOPSIS
      # need one module
      use Test::Needs 'Some::Module';

      # need multiple modules
      use Test::Needs 'Some::Module', 'Some::Other::Module';

      # need a given version of a module
      use Test::Needs {
        'Some::Module' => '1.005',
      };

      # check later
      use Test::Needs;
      test_needs 'Some::Module';

      # skips remainder of subtest
      use Test::More;
      use Test::Needs;
      subtest 'my subtest' => sub {
        test_needs 'Some::Module';
        ...
      };

      # check perl version
      use Test::Needs { perl => 5.020 };

DESCRIPTION
    Skip test scripts if modules are not available. The requested modules
    will be loaded, and optionally have their versions checked. If the
    module is missing, the test script will be skipped. Modules that are
    found but fail to compile will exit with an error rather than skip.

    If used in a subtest, the remainder of the subtest will be skipped.

    Skipping will work even if some tests have already been run, or if a
    plan has been declared.

    Versions are checked via a "$module->VERSION($wanted_version)" call.
    Versions must be provided in a format that will be accepted. No extra
    processing is done on them.

    If "perl" is used as a module, the version is checked against the
    running perl version ($]). The version can be specified as a number,
    dotted-decimal string, v-string, or version object.

    If the "RELEASE_TESTING" environment variable is set, the tests will
    fail rather than skip. Subtests will be aborted, but the test script
    will continue running after that point.

EXPORTS
  test_needs
    Has the same interface as when using Test::Needs in a "use".

SEE ALSO
    Test::Requires
        A similar module, with some important differences. Test::Requires
        will act as a "use" statement (despite its name), calling the import
        sub. Under "RELEASE_TESTING", it will BAIL_OUT if a module fails to
        load rather than using a normal test fail. It also doesn't
        distinguish between missing modules and broken modules.

    Test2::Require::Module
        Part of the Test2 ecosystem. Only supports running as a "use"
        command to skip an entire plan.

    Test2::Require::Perl
        Part of the Test2 ecosystem. Only supports running as a "use"
        command to skip an entire plan. Checks perl versions.

    Test::If
        Acts as a "use" statement. Only supports running as a "use" command
        to skip an entire plan. Can skip based on subref results.
