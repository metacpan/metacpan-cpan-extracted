NAME
    Win32::OLE::OPC - OPC Server Interface

SYNOPSIS
    Two ways of using the OPC interface are provided, the class
    methods:

        use Win32::OLE::OPC;

        my $opcintf = Win32::OLE::OPC->new('Someones.OPCAutomation',
                                           'Someones.Server');
        $opcintf->MoveToRoot;
        foreach $item ($opcintf->Leafs) {
          print $item->{name}, "\n";
          my %result = $opcintf->ItemData($item->{itemid});
          for $attrib (keys %result) {
            print "        [", $attrib, " = '", $result{$attrib}, "']", "\n";
          }
          print "\n";
        }
        foreach $item ($opcintf->Branches) {
          print $item->{name}, "\n";
        }

    or a tied hash:

        use Win32::OLE::OPC;

        my %OPC;
        tie %OPC, Win32::OLE::OPC, 'Someones.OPCAutomation', 'Someones.Server';

        # OK, list the keys...
        for $key (keys %OPC) {
          my %x = %{$OPC{$key}};
          print $key, "\n";
          for $attrib (keys %x) {
            print "        '", $attrib, "' = '", $x{$attrib}, "'", "\n";
          }
          print "\n";
        }

    The tied hash method has to return a reference to a hash
    containing the item data hence the unpleasant code '`%x =
    %{$OPC{$key}}''. Alternatively one can assign the returned value
    into a scalar and dereference it when using the hash like this
    '`keys %$x'' and '`$result->{$item}''.

    Note that both methods can be used together. First create an
    interface using the `new()' method and then tie it like this:

        tie %OPC, $opcintf, 'Someones.OPCAutomation', 'Someones.Server';

    To connect to a remote server add the name of the server as a
    parameter to the call to new() or to the tie:

      my $opcintf = Win32::OLE::OPC->new('Someones.OPCAutomation',
                                         'Someones.Server',
                                         'machine.name');
      tie %OPC, Win32::OLE::OPC, 'Someones.OPCAutomation',
                                 'Someones.Server',
                                 'machine.name';

DESCRIPTION
    A partial implementation of the OLE for Process Control dispatch
    interface as defined in the 'Data Access Automation Interface
    Standard' version 2.

    An exception is raised using `Carp::croak()' on any failure.

  METHODS

    Win32::OLE::OPC->new(DLLPROGID, SERVERPROGID, SERVERNODE)
        The `new()' method creates an instance of an OPC server
        object. The `DLLPROGID' argument is the COM progid of the
        Dll which implements the Dispatch interface to the OPC
        server. The `SERVERPROGID' is the COM progid of the OPC
        server containing the data you wish to access. The DLLPROGID
        and SERVERPROGID arguments are required.

        The SERVERNODE argument is optional and is the name of a
        remote machine running the SERVERPROGID. When SERVERNODE is
        specified a connection is made to the server using DCOM.
        WARNING: DCOM security can be a little difficult to
        understand so perseverance is required.

        As the OPC specification only allows one browser per
        instance of the dispatch Dll the `new()' method creates and
        keeps a browser object in `Win32::OLE::OPC->{browser}'

    MoveToRoot
        A browser method. Moves the current browse position to the
        root of the address space.

    MoveDown(TO)
        A browser method. Moves the current browse position one
        branch down the address space. The `TO' parameter is the
        branch name.

    MoveUp
        A browser method. Moves the current browse position one node
        up the address space.

    MoveTo(TO)
        A browser method. Moves the current browse position to the
        absolute location specified by `TO'.

            $opcintf->MoveTo('COM1._Diagnostics');

    Branches
        A browser method.

        Returns the branch names and itemid in a hash in an array.
        The method has a different name from the OPC ShowBranches
        method because it doesn't do quite the same thing.

        The returned array is also stored in `Win32::OLE::OPC-
        >{items}'.

        See synopsis for an example of how to call this method.

    Leafs
        A browser method.

        Returns the leaf names and itemid in a hash in an array. The
        method has a different name from the OPC ShowLeafs because
        it doesn't do quite the same thing. The hash has the members
        `name' and `itemid'. The number of items in the array is
        saved in `Win32::OLE::OPC->{count}'

        The returned array is also stored in `Win32::OLE::OPC-
        >{items}'.

            foreach $item ($opcintf->Leafs) {
              print $item->{name}, " ", item->{itemid}, "\n";
            }

    Item(N)
        Returns a hash contining the name and itemid of item `N'.
        Calls to `Leafs' and `Branches' collect the item data. This
        is an alternative method of fetching the address space.

          $opcintf->Leafs;
          for (my $i = 0; $i < $opcintf->{count}; $i++) {
            my $item = $opcintf->Item($i);
            print $item->{name}, " ", item->{itemid}, "\n";
          }

    ItemData(ITEMID)
        Use this to extract all the data the server holds for this
        item of data. The `ITEMID' is the `itemid' member of the
        hash returned by the `Leafs' method.

        It returns a hash, the keys of which are the available
        attributes (found by calling the OPC
        `QueryAvailableProperties()' method) and the values of in
        the hash are obtained by calling GetItemProperties.

    AvailableProperties(ITEMID)
        Returns the available properties of an item. The `ITEMID' is
        the `itemid' member of the hash returned by the `Leafs'
        method.

        It returns an array of hashes containing the available
        attributes found by calling the OPC
        `QueryAvailableProperties()' method. The hash contains `Id',
        `Description' and `DataType' members.

        The returned array is also stored in `Win32::OLE::OPC-
        >{properties}'.

            print " Id Type Description\n";
            foreach my $prop ($opcintf->AvailableProperties($item->{itemid})) {
              printf "%3d %4d %s\n",
                  $prop->{Id},
                  $prop->{DataType},
                  $prop->{Description};
            }

    ServerProperties
        Return a hash indexed by the following properties containing
        the property value:

            StartTime CurrentTime LastUpdateTime MajorVersion
            MinorVersion BuildNumber VendorInfo ServerState LocaleID
            Bandwidth OPCGroups PublicGroupNames ServerName
            ServerNode ClientName

        Note that the OPCGroups value is itself a reference to a
        hash and it contains a hash member indexed 'Parent' which is
        a hash pointing back up.

    GetOPCServers
        Return an array containing the names of available servers.
        Can be called with the progid of the dispatch Dll as an
        argument, in which case it will connect to the Dll and
        extract the list of servers. It can also be called using the
        object created by a call to new, in which case the name of
        the Dll is not required. The GetOPCServers is not exported
        by default.

          use Win32::OLE::OPC qw(GetOPCServers);

          my @AvailableServers = GetOPCServers('Someones.OPCAutomation');

    BrowserProperties
        Return a hash indexed by the following properties containing
        the property value:

            Organization Filter DataType AccessRights CurrentPosition Count

    GetItemIdFromName
        This is not a standard OPC browser method. It translates a
        full OPC path name to an item id. It is often the case that
        the item id and the OPC path name is one and the same thing,
        but you cannot assume that!

  TIED HASH

    See the SYNOPSIS for example code.

    If you tie a hash to this module you can:

    Read an items attributes
        A reference to a hash keyed by attribute names is returned.
        See the synopsis fo an example.

    Access the Keys
        The keys of the hash can be enumerated so `keys' and `each'
        function will work.

    Writing, deleting or undefining a member of the hash is not
    possible.

  OPCGroups

    The Win32::OLE::OPC::OPCGroups method returns an OPCGroups
    object which is blessed into the perl Win32::OLE::OPC::Groups
    class.

    Properties
        Return a hash indexed by the following properties containing
        the property value:

          Parent DefaultGroupIsActive DefaultGroupUpdateRate DefaultGroupDeadband
          DefaultGroupLocaleID DefaultGroupTimeBias Count

        Note that the hash member indexed 'Parent' is a hash
        pointing back up to the parent properties.

    SetProperty(PROPERTY,VALUE)
        Set one of these properties to the value given.

          DefaultGroupIsActive DefaultGroupUpdateRate DefaultGroupDeadband
          DefaultGroupLocaleID DefaultGroupTimeBias

    Add(NAME)
        Add a group to the OPC groups collection. NAME is optional.

    Item([NUMBER | NAME])
        Get group by 1 based index or by the name used when it was
        added to the groups list.

    GetOPCGroup([SERVERHANDLE|NAME])
        Get group using the server handle or by the name used when
        it was added to the groups list.

    Remove([SERVERHANDLE|NAME])
        Remove group using the server handle or by the name used
        when it was added to the groups list.

    RemoveAll
        Remove all groups from the groups list.

    ConnectPublicGroup(NAME)
        You connect to a public group, it cannot be added. NAME is a
        string which identifies the group.

        This is untested as I have no server which implements public
        groups.

    RemovePublicGroup([SERVERHANDLE|NAME})
        You remove to a public group using this method. NAME is a
        string which identifies the group or SERVERHANDLE is the
        server handle. Talk about stating the obvious!

        This is untested as I have no server which implements public
        groups.

  OPCGroup

    The Win32::OLE::OPC::Group object has methods Add, Item,
    GetOPCGroup and ConnectPublicGroup which all return a hash
    blessed into the OPCGroup class.

    Properties
        Return a hash indexed by the following properties containing
        the property value:

          Parent Name IsPublic IsActive IsSubscribed ClientHandle ServerHandle
          LocaleID TimeBias DeadBand UpdateRate OPCItems

        Note that the hash member indexed 'Parent' is a hash
        pointing back up to the parent properties.

    SetProperty(PROPERTY,VALUE)
        Set one of these properties to the value given.

          Name IsActive IsSubscribed ClientHandle LocaleID TimeBias DeadBand
          UpdateRate

        The Win32::OLE::OPC::OPCGroup::OPCItems method returns an
        OPCItems object which is blessed into the perl
        Win32::OLE::OPC::Items class.

  OPCItems

    This class contains a collection of OPCItem objects.

    Properties

        the property value:

          Parent DefaultRequestedDataType DefaultAccessPath DefaultIsActive Count

        Note that the hash member indexed 'Parent' is a hash
        pointing back up to the parent properties.

    SetProperty(PROPERTY,VALUE)
        Set one of these properties to the value given.

          DefaultRequestedDataType DefaultAccessPath DefaultIsActive Count

    Item(NUMBER])
        Get item by 1 based index.

    GetOPCItem(SERVERHANDLE)
        Get item using the server handle.

    AddItem(ITEMID, CLIENTHANDLE)

        you get back later.

    AddItems(NUM, ITEMIDS, CLIENTHANDLES)
        Add a load of items.

          NUM is how many.
          ITEMIDS is a reference to an array of itemids.
          CLIENTHANDLES is a reference to an array of client handles.

    Remove(SERVERHANDLES)
        Removes the items in SERVERHANDLES.

  OPCItem

    This is the object used for reading and writing actual values.

    Properties
        Return a hash indexed by the following properties containing
        the property value:

          Parent ClientHandle ServerHandle AccessPath AccessRights ItemID IsActive
          RequestedDataType Value Quality TimeStamp CanonicalDataType EUType EUInfo

        Note that the hash member indexed 'Parent' is a hash
        pointing back up to the parent properties.

    Read(SOURCE)
        Read the value for this item. SOURCE is either $OPCCache or
        $OPCDevice, each of which is exported by OPC.pm by default.

        Read returns a hash reference which contains Value, Quality
        and TimeStamp values.

    Write(VALUE)
        Write VALUE to this item.

    ServerHandle

INSTALLATION
    If you have nmake you can use MakeMaker as follows:

      perl Makefile.PL
      nmake
      nmake test
      nmake install
      nmake documentation

    The final step makes OPC.html and OPC.txt from OPC.pm.

    If you don't have nmake then you will find OPC.html and OPC.txt
    are included in the package ready built and all you have to do
    is copy OPC.pm into the `site/lib/Win32/OLE' directory with your
    Perl installation. This module has been tested with ActiveState
    Perl build 522.
