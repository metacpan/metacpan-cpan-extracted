SYNOPSIS

                    fileid => [ 123, 456, 789 ],
                    nogzip => 1
            );

DESCRIPTION
    This module is a Perl interface to the Newzbin.com v3 direct APIs.
    Newzbin is a Usenet binary indexing service that also offers .nzb files
    - short summary files containing all the information a newsreader
    requires to download any given binary or set of binaries from Usenet.

METHODS
  COMMON METHODS
   new
            my $nzb = WWW::Newzbin->new(
                    username => "joebloggs",
                    password => "secretpass123"
            );

    The "new()" method constructs a new "WWW::Newzbin" object.

    "username" and "password" should be valid Newzbin credentials, and both
    must be supplied for the object to be successfully constructed. The
    "new()" method does not check whether these credentials are valid.

    Other (optional) parameters are:

    *   "nowarnings" - "WWW::Newzbin" "warn"s whenever something unexpected
        happens (for example, if an unrecognised parameter is passed to a
        method, or if a recognised parameter is passed in an incorrect
        manner). Any true value (e.g. 1) for "nowarnings" disables all
        warnings issued by "WWW::Newzbin".

    *   "proxy" - Defines a proxy server that the underlying LWP::UserAgent
        object will use when accessing Newzbin. Should be given in the
        format "http://proxy.address:port".

    "die"s if the username or password are missing, and "warn"s if any
    unrecognised parameters are given.

   error_code
            print "Error code for last error: " . $nzb->error_code;

    If an error occurred during the last method call, this method will
    return an integer describing what kind of error occurred (or "undef" if
    an error did not occur during the last method call). Check the
    documentation for each individual method for a list of expected return
    values from "error_code".

    This method's output is programmatically useful, but isn't pretty to
    give back to a user. Consider "error_message" for user feedback.

   error_message
            print "An error occurred while processing your request: " . $nzb->error_message;

    If an error occurred during the last method call, this method will
    return a short description of the error (or "undef" if an error did not
    occur during the last method call). Check the documentation for each
    individual method for an idea of what to expect for a return value from
    this method - the message will depend on the "error_code".

    This method's output is useful for user feedback, but isn't very useful
    programmatically. Consider "error_code" for handling errors using code.

   search_files
            my @results = $nzb->search_files(
                    query => "the john smith orchestra",
                    category => [ NEWZBIN_CAT_MUSIC, NEWZBIN_CAT_MOVIES ],
                    group => [ "alt.binaries.music", "alt.binaries.test" ],
                    retention => 30,
                    resultlimit => 50,
                    sortfield => NEWZBIN_SORTFIELD_SUBJECT,
                    sortorder => NEWZBIN_SORTORDER_ASC
            );

    Searches Newzbin's files index for a given string, and (optionally)
    filters the results based on given criteria. Please note that it is not
    possible to search Newzbin without a valid Premium account.

    Search criteria are passed as parameters to the method. The following
    parameters are allowed; each is optional unless otherwise specified:

    *   "query" (required) - The string of text to search for.

    *   "category" - The Newzbin category (or categories) to search. Any of
        the "NEWZBIN_CAT_*" constants specified in WWW::Newzbin::Constants
        are valid. May be a single constant if only one category is to be
        searched, or an arrayref of constants if more than one category is
        to be searched. Default is none (i.e. all categories are searched).

    *   "group" - The Usenet newsgroup (or newsgroups) to search. May be a
        scalar containing the name of a single newsgroup to search, or an
        arrayref of scalars if more than one newsgroup is to be searched.
        Default is none (i.e. all newsgroups are searched).

    *   "retention" - The maximum age (in days) of a file that is permitted
        for it to be included as a search result. Must be at least 1, and at
        most 240 (this might change without notice; see "LIMITATIONS").
        Default is currently 7 (again, this might change without notice; see
        "LIMITATIONS").

    *   "minsize" and "maxsize" - Respectively, the minimum and maximum
        sizes (in bytes) that files must be to count as results. Either
        parameter may be given; if both are given, "minsize" must be less
        than or equal to "maxsize", otherwise neither criteria will be
        considered in the search. Defaults are 0 for both parameters (i.e.
        no file size restrictions).

    *   "filetype" - Filter by file type. At the time of writing, values
        currently accepted by Newzbin for this field are *SFV*, *NFO* and
        *NZB* (this might change without notice; see "LIMITATIONS"). Default
        is none (i.e. all file types are allowed).

    *   "resultoffset" and "resultlimit" - Respectively, the offset at which
        to begin returning results and the maximum number of results to
        return for this search. Either parameter (or both) may be specified.
        "resultoffset" should be at least 0 and "resultlimit" must be at
        most 5000 (this might change without notice; see "LIMITATIONS"),
        otherwise neither criteria will be considered in the search.
        Defaults are 0 for "resultoffset" and 500 for "resultlimit" (again,
        this might change without notice; see "LIMITATIONS").

    *   "sortfield" and "sortorder" - Respectively, the field by which to
        sort and the order in which to sort. Any of the
        "NEWZBIN_SORTFIELD_*" constants specified in WWW::Newzbin::Constants
        are valid for the "sortfield" parameter, and any of the
        "NEWZBIN_SORTORDER_*" constants specified in WWW::Newzbin::Constants
        are valid for the "sortorder" parameter. If an invalid value is used
        for either parameter, the values given for both parameters will not
        be considered as search criteria. Defaults are
        "NEWZBIN_SORTFIELD_DATE" (the file's posted date) for "sortfield"
        and "NEWZBIN_SORTORDER_ASC" (ascending) for "sortorder" (either of
        these might change without notice; see "LIMITATIONS").

    If the search is successful, the method returns an array of results
    (with the first result at the head of the array). Each result is a
    hashref containing the following keys:

    *   "fileid" - Newzbin's unique, internal ID for this file. Suitable for
        use in "get_nzb".

    *   "subject" - The file's subject (title), as given by its poster.

    *   "posttime" - Unix representation of the date and time at which the
        file was posted to Usenet (may not be completely accurate; see
        "LIMITATIONS").

    *   "filesize" - The size of the file, in bytes (may not be completely
        accurate; see "LIMITATIONS").

    *   "author" - The name of the user who posted the file to Usenet.

    *   "groups" - An arrayref containing a list of the newsgroups to which
        this file was posted.

    The method "die"s if required parameters were not passed to it, and
    "warn"s if unrecognised parameters were passed (but the search will
    still progress). If the search was otherwise unsuccessful, the method
    returns "undef" and "error_code" will return one of the following
    values:

    *   -1 - The search could not be carried out due to a technical fault;
        "error_message" gives a more verbose reason.

    *   -2 - Invalid Newzbin account credentials were given in the
        constructor for "WWW::Newzbin".

    *   -3 - The account credentials given in the constructor were valid,
        but the account is not a Newzbin Premium account. A Premium account
        is required for searching.

    *   -4 - No results that matched the given search criteria could be
        found.

   search_files_total
            print "Total number of files found: " . $nzb->search_files_total;

    If used after a successful call to "search_files", this method returns
    the total number of results that would have been returned if
    "resultlimit" had not been specified. If used after an unsuccessful (or
    no) call to "search_files", returns "undef".

   get_nzb
            my ($nzb_file, $report_name, $report_category) = $nzb->get_nzb(reportid => 12345678);
        
            my ($nzb_file_gzipped, $report_name, $report_category) = $nzb->get_nzb(
                    reportid => 12345678,
                    leavegzip => 1
            );
        
            my $nzb_file = $nzb->get_nzb(
                    fileid => [ 123, 456, 789 ]
            );

    Constructs an NZB (.nzb file) based on either a Newzbin report ID or one
    or more Newzbin file IDs. Please note that it is not possible to
    construct NZB files without a valid Premium account.

    NZB files are easily compressed, and Newzbin supports *gzip* file
    compression for NZB downloads. If Compress::Zlib is available,
    "WWW::Newzbin" will transparently handle compression to reduce bandwidth
    usage; otherwise, the NZB file will be downloaded uncompressed.

    Either (but not both) of the following parameters are required:

    *   "reportid" - A scalar containing the ID of the Newzbin report to
        download. All files listed in the report will be included in the
        NZB.

    *   "fileid" - A scalar or arrayref of scalars containing the Newzbin
        file ID or IDs to include in the NZB.

    Other acceptable parameters for this method are as follows (all
    parameters listed below are optional):

    *   "nogzip" - If set to a true value (i.e. 1), forcefully disables the
        compression feature explained above. Use this if Compress::Zlib is
        installed but isn't working for some reason.

    *   "leavegzipped" - If set to a true value (i.e. 1), download the
        compressed version of the NZB file, but leave it compressed when the
        method returns (rather than decompressing it and returning that,
        which is the default behaviour). Useful if the NZB file needs to be
        transferred over a network to another end-user.

    The method's return value depends on how it was called:

    *   If "fileid" was supplied, the method returns a scalar containing the
        NZB file.

    *   If "reportid" was supplied, the method returns an array containing
        the following (in this order):

        *   A scalar containing the NZB file;

        *   A scalar containing the name of the report;

        *   The Newzbin category in which the report was filed (see
            WWW::Newzbin::Constants).

    The method "die"s if one of the required parameters were not passed to
    it, and "warn"s if unrecognised parameters were passed (but the download
    will still occur). If the download was otherwise unsuccessful, the
    method returns "undef" and "error_code" will return one of the following
    values:

    *   Any integer greater than 0 - Newzbin rate-limits the number of NZB
        download requests that a user can make in a given timeframe. A
        positive integer means your account is being rate-limited and that
        you must wait this many seconds before sending your request again.
        See "LIMITATIONS".

    *   -1 - The download could not be requested due to a technical fault;
        "error_message" gives a more verbose reason.

    *   -2 - Invalid Newzbin account credentials were given in the
        constructor for "WWW::Newzbin".

    *   -3 - The account credentials given in the constructor were valid,
        but the account is not a Newzbin Premium account. A Premium account
        is required for downloading NZB files.

    *   -4 - In the words of Newzbin's documentation: *"the data trying to
        be fetched does not exist or is not accessible"*. If this error code
        is returned, do not try the same request again because you will
        receive the same response.

    *   -5 - "WWW::Newzbin" downloaded the compressed version of the NZB and
        tried to decompress it using Compress::Zlib, but failed for some
        reason. If this error code is returned, consider using "nogzip" or
        "leavegzipped" to bypass decompression.

  ADVANCED METHODS
   lwp_useragent
            $nzb->lwp_useragent->timeout(30);

    Grants access to the underlying LWP::UserAgent object that powers
    "WWW::Newzbin". Useful for fine-tuning; if you just need to specify a
    proxy server for LWP::UserAgent, consider using the far-neater "proxy"
    parameter in the "new" constructor.

LIMITATIONS
  USENET LIMITATIONS
    The "posttime" and "filesize" values returned for each result by
    "search_files" may not always be accurate because Newzbin reports the
    post time and file size based on the first news server on which it sees
    the file. Newzbin's *FileFind* documentation states that the file size
    *"should be accurate to within a few kilobytes"*, however.

  NEWZBIN LIMITATIONS
    *FileFind*, the Newzbin API upon which "search_files" relies, has
    default values for a number of its parameters (specifically:
    "retention", "resultoffset" and "resultlimit"). The "WWW::Newzbin"
    documentation states these defaults but they are actually set by the
    Newzbin API, not by this module. This means, of course, that the Newzbin
    developers could change these default values at any time, which may
    drastically alter the search results that "WWW::Newzbin" returns. Every
    effort will be made to keep this documentation up-to-date with any
    changes made to the default values in the *FileFind* API, but you are
    advised to explicitly specify "search_files" parameters rather than
    relying too much on the defaults.

    Newzbin's retention is currently 240 days. At the moment no mainstream
    Usenet provider has a retention that Newzbin doesn't cover, but this
    might change in future. Therefore, while the "WWW::Newzbin"
    documentation states that the "search_files" "retention" parameter must
    not exceed 240, this limit is not hardcoded and specifying longer
    retentions will not result in a warning or error.

    Newzbin intentionally caps *FileFind*'s result limit to 5000. The
    "search_files" "resultlimit" parameter, therefore, should not exceed
    5000; although Newzbin could of course change or remove this limit at
    any time without notice, so "WWW::Newzbin" will not produce a warning or
    error if "resultlimit" is greater than 5000.

    The "search_files" "filetype" parameter only accepts a handful of file
    types. Newzbin's *FileFind* documentation states that you're welcome to
    contact them to request indexing of other file types. Nevertheless, the
    *FileFind* documentation also states that file type filtering is
    *"fairly accurate, but don't rely on it as any malicious Usenet poster
    could easily circumvent it"*.

    *DirectNZB*, the Newzbin API upon which "get_nzb" relies, only allows
    either one report ID or several file IDs per request. The documentation
    states that this is unlikely to change in future.

    *DirectNZB* also limits the rate at which accounts can generate NZB
    files - currently the restriction is 5 NZB files per minute per IP
    address. If "get_nzb" reports a positive integer as its "error_code",
    you are advised to wait that many seconds (or, preferably, 60 seconds)
    before calling "get_nzb" again. Failure to do so might result in your IP
    address (or even the entire account) being banned from accessing
    Newzbin.
