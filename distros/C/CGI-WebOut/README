CGI/WebOut
==========

The README is used to introduce the module and provide instructions on
how to install the module, any machine dependencies it may have (for
example C compilers and installed libraries) and any other information
that should be provided before the module is installed.

A README file is required for CPAN modules since CPAN extracts the
README file from a module distribution so that people browsing the
archive can use it get an idea of the modules uses. It is usually a
good idea to provide version information here so that people can
decide whether fixes for the module are worth downloading.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

SYNOPSIS

  # Simple CGI script (no 500 Apache error!)
  use CGI::WebOut;
  print "Hello world!"; # wow, we may NOT output Content-type!
  # Handle output for {}-block
  my $str=grab {
    print "Hi there!\n";
  };
  $str=~s/\n/<br>/sg;
  print $str;

DESCRIPTION

CGI::WebOut - Perl extension for handle CGI output (in PHP-style)

This module is used to make CGI programmer's work more comfortable. 
The main idea is to handle output stream (STDOUT) to avoid any data 
to be sent to browser without Content-type header. Of cource,
you may also send your own headers to browser using Header(). Any 
errors will be printed at the bottom of page "in PHP-style". You may 
also use Carp module together with CGI::WebOut.

You may also handle any program block's output (using print etc.)
and place it to the variable using grab {...} subroutine. It is a 
very useful feature for lots of CGI-programmers.

The last thing - support for try-catch "instruction". WARNING: this 
is NOT tre real instruction, like map {...}, grep {...} etc.! Be careful
with return instruction in try-catch blocks.

Note: you may use CGI::WebOut not only for CGI scripts. In "non-CGI" 
script headers are NOT output, and warnings are shown as plain-text. 
grab {...}, try-catch etc. work as usual.

DEPENDENCIES
