SYNOPSIS

    In your module (producer):

     package Foo;
     use Log::ger; # will import some logging methods e.g. log_warn, log_error
    
     # produce some logs
     sub foo {
         ...
         log_warn "an error occurred";
         log_error "an error occurred: %03d - %s", $errcode, $errmsg;
     }
     1;

    In your application:

     use Foo;
     use Log::ger::Output 'Screen';
    
     foo();

DESCRIPTION

    EARLY RELEASE, EXPERIMENTAL.

    This is yet another logging framework. Like Log::Any, it separates
    producers and consumers. Unlike Log::Any (and like Log::Contextual), it
    uses plain functions (non-OO). Some features:

      * Low startup overhead;

      * Low overhead;

      * Customizable levels;

      * Changing levels and outputs during run-time;

      For example, you can debug your running server application to turn on
      trace logs temporarily when you need to investigate something.

      * Option to optimize away the logging statements when unnecessary;

      See Log::ger::OptAway.

      * Interoperability with other logging frameworks;

      See Log::ger::Output::LogAny to interop with Log::Any.

FAQ

 How do I create multiple loggers?

    For example, in Log::Any:

     my $log = Log::Any->get_logger;
     my $log_dump = Log::Any->get_logger(category => "dump"); # to dump contents
    
     $log->debugf("Headers is: %s", $http_res->{headers});
     $log_dump->debug($http_res->{content});

    in Log::ger:

     # instead of installing to package, we setup objects/hashes for the secondary
     # loggers
     my $log_dump = Log::ger::setup_object(category => "dump");
     # or, for hash: my $log_dump = Log::ger::setup_hash(category => "dump");
    
     log_debug("Headers is: %s", $http_res->{headers});
     $log_dump->log_debug($http_res->{content});
     # or, for hash: $log_dump->{log_debug}->($http_res->{content});

 How do I do custom formatting

    For example, a la Log::Contextual:

     log_warn { 'The number of stuffs is: ' . $obj->stuffs_count };

    See Log::ger::Format::Block for an example.

INTERNALS

 Plugins

    Plugins are how Log::ger provides its flexibility. Plugins are run at
    various phases. Plugin routine is passed a hash argument and is
    expected to return an array:

     [$result, $flow_control]

    Some phases will stop after the first plugin that returns non-undef
    $result. $flow_control can be set to 1 to stop immediately after this
    hook.

    Aguments received by plugin: target (str, can be package if installing
    to a package, or hash or object), target_arg (str, when target is
    package, will be the package name; when target is hash will be the
    hash; when target is object will be the object's package), setup_args
    (hash, arguments passed to Log::ger when importing). These arguments
    are received by plugins for create_log_routine and
    create_log_is_routine which are run for every level: level (numeric
    level), str_level.

    Available phases:

      * create_filter_routine

      * create_formatter_routine

      * create_log_routine phase

      Used to create "log_level" routines. Run for each level.

      * create_log_is_routine phase

      Used to create "log_level" routines. Run for each level.

      * after_install_log_routine phase
