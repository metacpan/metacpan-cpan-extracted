    * misc cleanup

    * added VERSIONs to all subclasses to fix CPAN indexing
    * fixed PropertyList and MetaList to return native objects without wrappers
      (thanks to bmiele@ipnstock.com for the bug report)
    * fixed bug in Result subclass with returning undef when native returns undef

0.05
    * added default index value 'index.swish-e' to mimic libswish-e default

    * added die_on_error() method.
