NAME
    ToolSet - Load your commonly-used modules in a single import

VERSION
    version 1.03

SYNOPSIS
    Creating a ToolSet:

        # My/Tools.pm
        package My::Tools;

        use base 'ToolSet';

        ToolSet->use_pragma( 'strict' );
        ToolSet->use_pragma( 'warnings' );
        ToolSet->use_pragma( qw/feature say switch/ ); # perl 5.10

        # define exports from other modules
        ToolSet->export(
            'Carp'          => undef,       # get the defaults
            'Scalar::Util'  => 'refaddr',   # or a specific list
        );

        # define exports from this module
        our @EXPORT = qw( shout );
        sub shout { print uc shift };

        1; # modules must return true

    Using a ToolSet:

        # my_script.pl

        use My::Tools;

        # strict is on
        # warnings are on
        # Carp and refaddr are imported

        carp "We can carp!";
        print refaddr [];
        shout "We can shout, too!";

DESCRIPTION
    ToolSet provides a mechanism for creating logical bundles of modules
    that can be treated as a single, reusable toolset that is imported as
    one. Unlike CPAN bundles, which specify modules to be installed
    together, a toolset specifies modules to be imported together into other
    code.

    Toolset is designed to be a superclass -- subclasses will specify
    specific modules to bundle. ToolSet supports custom import lists for
    each included module and even supports compile-time pragmas like
    "strict", "warnings" and "feature".

    A ToolSet module does not physically bundle the component modules, but
    rather specifies lists of modules to be used together and import
    specifications for each. By adding the component modules to a
    prerequisites list in a "Makefile.PL" or "Build.PL" for a ToolSet
    subclass, an entire dependency chain can be managed as a single unit
    across scripts or distributions that use the subclass.

INTERFACE
  Setting up
        use base 'ToolSet';

    ToolSet must be used as a base class.

  @EXPORT
        our @EXPORT = qw( shout };
        sub shout { print uc shift }

    Functions defined in the ToolSet subclass can be automatically exported
    during "use()" by listing them in an @EXPORT array.

  "export"
        ToolSet->export(
            'Carp' => undef,
            'Scalar::Util' => 'refaddr',
        );

    Specifies packages and arguments to import via "use()". An argument of
    "undef" or the empty string calls "use()" with default imports.
    Arguments should be provided either as a whitespace delimited string or
    in an anonymous array. An empty anonymous array will be treated like
    passing the empty list as an argument to "use()". Here are examples of
    how how specifications will be provided to "use()":

        'Carp' => undef                 # use Carp;
        'Carp' => q{}                   # use Carp;
        'Carp' => 'carp croak'          # use Carp qw( carp croak );
        'Carp' => [ '!carp', 'croak' ]  # use Carp qw( !carp croak );
        'Carp' => []                    # use Carp ();

    Elements in an array are passed to "use()" as a white-space separated
    list, so elements may not themselves contain spaces or unexpected
    results will occur. (But read further below about exact whitespace
    handling.)

    As of version 1.00, modules may be repeated multiple times. This is
    useful with modules like autouse.

        ToolSet->export(
          autouse => [ 'Carp' => qw(carp croak) ],
          autouse => [ 'Scalar::Util' => qw(refaddr blessed) ],
        );

    As of version 1.02, if you need exact handling of whitespace, pass a
    reference to a string and it will be used verbatim:

        'Foo' => \'-foo => { bar => "Some thing with spaces" }'

        #  use Foo -foo => { bar => "Some thing with spaces" }'

  "use_pragma"
      ToolSet->use_pragma( 'strict' );         # use strict;
      ToolSet->use_pragma( 'feature', ':5.10' ); # use feature ':5.10';

    Specifies a compile-time pragma to enable and optional arguments to that
    pragma. This must only be used with pragmas that act via the magic $^H
    or "%^H" variables. It must not be used with modules that have other
    side-effects during import() such as exporting functions.

  "no_pragma"
      ToolSet->no_pragma( 'indirect' ); # no indirect;

    Like "use_pragma", but disables a pragma instead.

    If a pragma is specified in both a "use_pragma" and "no_pragma"
    statement, the "use_pragma" will be executed first. This allow turning
    on a pragma with default settings and then disabling some of them.

      ToolSet->use_pragma( 'strict' );
      ToolSet->no_pragma ( 'strict', 'refs' );

  "set_feature" (DEPRECATED)
    See "use_pragma" instead.

  "set_strict" (DEPRECATED)
    See "use_pragma" instead.

  "set_warnings" (DEPRECATED)
    See "use_pragma" instead.

DIAGNOSTICS
    ToolSet will report an error for a module that cannot be found just like
    an ordinary call to "use()" or "require()".

    Additional error messages include:

    *   "Invalid import specification for MODULE" -- an incorrect type was
        provided for the list to be imported (e.g. a hash reference)

    *   "Can't import missing subroutine NAME" -- the named subroutine is
        listed in @EXPORT, but is not defined in the ToolSet subclass

CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT
    ToolSet requires no configuration files or environment variables.

DEPENDENCIES
    ToolSet requires at least Perl 5.6. ToolSet subclasses will, of course,
    be dependent on any modules they load.

SEE ALSO
    Similar functionality is provided by the Toolkit module, though that
    module requires defining the bundle via text files found within
    directories in "PERL5LIB" and uses source filtering to insert their
    contents as files are compiled.
