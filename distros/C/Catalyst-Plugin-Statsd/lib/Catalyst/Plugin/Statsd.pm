=head1 NAME

Catalyst::Plugin::Statsd - Log Catalyst stats to statsd

=head1 VERSION

version v0.6.3

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Catalyst qw/
     Statsd
     -Stats=1
   /;

  use Net::Statsd::Tiny;

  __PACKAGE__->config(
    'psgi_middleware', [
        Statsd => {
            client => Net::Statsd::Tiny->new,
        },
    ],
  );

  # (or you can specify the Statsd middleware in your
  # application's PSGI file.)

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This plugin will log L<Catalyst> timing statistics to statsd.

=head2 CONFIGURATION

  __PACKAGE__->config(

    'Plugin::Statsd' => {
        disable_stats_report => 0,
    },

  );

=head2 C<disable_stats_report>

Enabling stats will also log a table of statistics to the Catalyst
log.  If you do not want this, then set C<disable_stats_report>
to true.

Note that if you are modifying the C<log_stats> method or using
another plugin that does this, then this may interfere with that if
you disable the stats report.

This defaults to

    !$c->debug

=head1 METHODS

=head2 C<statsd_client>

  $c->statsd_client;

Returns the statsd client.

This is the statsd client used by L<Plack::Middleware::Statsd>.

=head2 C<statsd_metric_name_filter>

  $c->statsd_metric_name_filter( $stat_or_name );

This method returns the name to be used for logging stats, or C<undef>
if the metric should be ignored.

Only alphanumeric characters, hyphens or underscores in namespaces are
accepted. All other characters are converted to dots, with consecutive
dots compressed into a single dot.

If it is passed a non-arrayref, then it will stringify the argument
and return that.

If it is passed an array reference, then it assumes the argument comes
from L<Catalyst::Stats> report and is converted into a suitable metric
name.

You can override or modify this method to filter out which metrics you
want logged, or to change the names of the metrics.

=head1 METRICS

=head2 C<catalyst.response.time>

This logs the Catalyst reponse time that is normally reported by
Catalyst.  However, it is probably unnecessary since
L<Plack::Middleware::Statsd> also logs response times.

=head2 C<catalyst.stats.*.time>

These are metrics generated from L<Catalyst::Stats>.

All non-word characters in the paths in an action are changed to dots,
e.g. the timing for an action C</foo/bar> will be logged with the
metric C<catalyst.stats.foo.bar.time>.

The metric name is generated by L</statsd_metric_name_filter>.

=head1 KNOWN ISSUES

=head2 Custom Profiling Points

If you have custom profiling points, then these will be treated as
top-level names in the C<catalyst.stats.*> namespaces, e.g.

  my $stats = $c->stats;
  $stats->profile( begin => 'here' );

  ...

  $stats->profile( end => 'here' );

will be logged to statsd in the C<catalyst.stats.here.time> namespace.

If you do not want this, then you can work around this by prefixing
the block name with a controller name, e.g.

  $stats->profile( begin => 'controller.here' );
