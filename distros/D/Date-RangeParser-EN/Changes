    - Support "since [element]"
    - Fix case where unit tests would fail on older versions of Date::Manip

0.04  Wed Sep 19 11:43:36 2012
    - Add support for parsing months followed by a 4-digit year, like 
      August 2012
    - Add support for parsing explicit ranges where either side of the range is
      something Date::RangeParser::EN already supports, e.g., 
      August to December, January 21 thru February 1st, 9/1 - 9/5, 
      Jun through the end of this year, etc.
    - The now_callback is used to set the ForceDate setting of Date::Manip when
      falling back to Date::Manip for parsing. Care has been taken to make sure
      this happens correctly for DM5 and DM6
