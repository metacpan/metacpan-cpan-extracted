- extend the monitor stuff
    - socket errors
    - remote_subscribe/remote_unsubscribe

- Other IPC then just INET and UNIX domain sockets (IPC, Pipes, FIFOs)

- Global event naming scheme
    This will also make documentation and discussions easier.

- Access restrictions
    Currently all a foreign kernel can post events to any session w/in
    a local kernel.

    A much better idea would be to have sessions register the events
    they want foreign kernels to get access.  

- Proxy sessions
    During negociation phase, a kernel will tell the foreign kernel about
    all the sessions that have "exposed" events.  The local kernel will
    create proxy sessions locally of thses sessions.  These sessions will
    "die" when the kernel disconnects.  (Hey, why not have these proxy
    sessions attempt to reconnect also?) This will mean $_[SENDER] will
    always make sense.

    However, the negociation phase could rapidly become overly tedious if a
    foreign kernel knows about 100 Sessions, but the local kernel is only 
    going to use one of them.

- Lazy Proxy creation
    When someone does a $kernel->alias_resolve(), the kernel could query
    foreign kernels if they have the given session alias.



Looking wider :

- POE::Carp  AKA MONITORING
    POE needs a general exception handling mechanism.  This will allow us
    to send better diagnostic messages back to foreign kernels.  Maybe
    something along the lines of the monitor stuff.

- IKC clouds
    I envision a multiply connected network of IKC servers, one per host.  A
    IKC server would need to be able to find at least one other IKC server. 
    After connecting, they would send each other all the kernels they know
    about, and how to connect to each of them.

    A kernel that wants to expose sessions and events to foreign kernels
    (let's call it a IKC module) would only connect to the nearest IKC
    server, which would take care of propogating the information to the
    other servers in the cluster).

    This will allow us to implement load balancing, rollover,
    high-availablility and other buzz-words.  And remote CONFIGS!  See next
    item

- Automagical IKC
    /etc/poe.conf or ~/.poe.conf could have all the params needed for
    connecting to the IKC cluster.

    Cf Stem: it has a nice config-driven way of doing things (local config,
    ARGS config and even remote config).  This is similar, but better, then
    the POE::Interface (a la IDL) idea I had at the begining.
