*** Ticket Format Has Changed ***
    Tickets are now opaque, and are strings that include the signature hash,
        and the ticket data in MIME::Base64 encoding. This ensures that fields
        that may have been added to the ticket by a subclass are included in
        the signature.

Release 0.40
   o update to use new Apache::Filter API (you need at least 1.012 now)
   o Create Apache2::AuthTicket from copy of Apache::AuthTicket and ported to
     mod_perl 2.0 API.  This is the first release that supports mod_perl2
   o MP2 - use SQL::Abstract to generate queries

Release 0.31
   o Removed an email address from Changes file via owners request.

Release 0.30
   o Changed calls from to Digest::MD5->md5_hex to just Digest::MD5::md5_hex()
     This causes md5 passwords generated with other md5() routines (PHP for 
     example to fail).  Thanks to Steve Chadsey for spotting this.

     ** NOTE ** MD5 passwords that worked with previous versions will not work
     with this version due to the fact that md5_hex() was used incorrectly.  
     Upgrading from previous versions will also invalidate any current tickets
     because the ticket generation routines also were using md5_hex
     incorrectly.

Release 0.20
   o Renamed module from Apache::TicketAccess to Apache::AuthTicket after
     discovering that Apache::TicketAccess is distributed with the mod_perl
     book examples.
   o Adapted module to Apache::AuthCookie v2.011.  This module now
     subclasses Apache::AuthCookie and relies on AuthCookie for all of the 
     cookie login logic.  This was basically a complete rewrite.
   o Split up query to fetch the server secret so that the LIMIT clause is
     not needed (for Sybase ASE backends, thanks to Eivind Trondsen)
   o Made DBI commit() only be called if AutoCommit is off. 
     (silences a warn() for MySQL)
   o Added support for md5 style passwords.
   o Added support for crypt() style passwords.
   o Added way to retrieve reason for login using
     $r->subprocess_env("AuthTicketReason").
   o Added support for Idle Timeout logouts via TicketIdleTimeout
     configuration.
   o Added "sample" directory with sql examples for setting up pgsql and mysql
     backends, as well as httpd.conf samples.
   o Removed libapreq dependency (AuthCookie does this stuff now)

Relaese 0.10
   o Initial public release: Apache::TicketAccess 0.10
