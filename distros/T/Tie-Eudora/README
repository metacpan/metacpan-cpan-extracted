     tie *MAILBOX, 'Tie::Eudora';
     open MAILBOX,'>',$mbx;

DESCRIPTION
    The "Tie::Eudora" program module provides a File Handle Tie package for
    reading and writing of Eudora mailbox files. The "Tie::Eudora" package
    handles each email in Eudora mailbox files as a record. Each record is
    read and written not as a scalar text string but as an array of
    "field-name, field-body" pairs corresponding to the header and body
    fields in the email.

  Email Array

    An email array, "@email", is an array of "field-name, field-body" pairs
    where the even index array members are the "field-name" and the odd
    index array members are the field-values. The "field-name, field-body"
    pairs, except for the last pair, are as specified in RFC 822,
    http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc822.txt, and are in the order that they
    appear in an "$encoded_email" encoded in accordance with RFC 822. The
    last "field-name, field-body" pair has a "field-name" of 'X-Body' and
    the "field-body" contents is the body of the "$encoded_email".

  Mailbox Array

    A mailbox array, "@mailbox", is a list of references to email arrays.

REQUIREMENTS
  Eudora Mailbox Format

    A "@mailbox" array, written using the appropriate "Tie::Eudora" package
    file subroutines, shall[1] produce a Eudora mailbox file that can be
    read by *Eudora 5.0*. One appropriate use of the "Tie::Eudora" package
    subroutines to create a Eudora mailbox file is as follows:

     tie *MAILBOX, 'Tie::Eudora';
     open MAILBOX,'>',$mbx;
     print MAILBOX @Write_mailbox;
     close MAILBOX;

  Eudora Mailbox Lossless

    The "@read_mailbox" array from reading a mailbox file in accordance with
    Eudora Mailbox Format using the appropriate "Tie::Eudora" package file
    subroutines, shall[1] be exactly the same as the mailbox array
    "@write_mailbox" used to write the Eudora mailbox file. One appropriate
    use of the "Tie::Eudora" package subroutines to read a Eudora mailbox
    file is as follows:

     tie *MAILBOX, 'Tie::Eudora';
     open MAILBOX,'<',$mbx;
     @read_mailbox = <MAILBOX>;
     close MAILBOX;

  RFC822 Email Format

    A "@mailbox" array, written using the "Tie::Eudora" package file
    subroutines, shall[1] create a Eudora mailbox file that can be read by
    Eudora 5.0. A typical use of the "Tie::Eudora" package subroutines are
    as follows:

     tie *MAILBOX, 'Tie::Eudora';
     open MAILBOX,'>',$mbx;
     print MAILBOX @Write_mailbox;
     close MAILBOX;

  RFC822 Email Lossless

    The "@read_mailbox" array from reading a mailbox file in accordance with
    Eudora[1] using the "Tie::Eudora" package file subroutines, shall[1] be
    exactly the same as the mailbox array "@write_mailbox" used to write the
    Eudora mailbox file.

     tie *MAILBOX, 'Tie::Eudora';
     open MAILBOX,'<',$mbx;
     @read_mailbox = <MAILBOX>;
     close MAILBOX;
