        - WARNING: Incompatible changes in this release! Oliver G has pointed out that the as_microsoft and as_ieee were switched. I have swapped their output formats in this version and bumped the version to 0.9. This change brings the API in sync with Net::MAC.

0.82    2013-12-09
        - Tests for bad mac addresses from Oliver Gorwits (http://gorwits.me.uk/)
        - For Cisco format 1111.2222.3333 - we no longer support dropping leading zeros. This was a trade off to better detect broken mac's. Cisco doesnt drop them anyway so its, IMO, the most sensible compromise.
