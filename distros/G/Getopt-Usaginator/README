            Usage: xyzzy <options>
    
            --derp          Derp derp derp

        # The 'usage' subroutine is now installed

        ...

        $options = parse_options( @ARGV ); # Not supplied by Usaginator

        usage if $options{help}; # Print usage and exit with status 0

        if ( ! $options{derp} ) {
            # Print warning and usage and exit with status -1
            usage "You should really derp";
        }
    
        if ( $options{durp} ) {
            # Print warning and usage and exit with status 2
            usage 2 => "--durp is not ready yet";
        }

        ...

        usage 3 # Print usage and exit with status 3

DESCRIPTION
    Getopt::Usaginator is a tool for creating a handy usage subroutine for
    commandline applications

    It does not do any option parsing, but is best paired with Getopt::Long
    or any of the other myriad of option parsers

USAGE
  use Getopt::Usaginator <usage>
    Install a "usage" subroutine configured with the <usage> text

  $code = Getopt::Usaginator->usaginator( <usage> )
    Return a subroutine configured with the <usage> text

  ...
    More advanced usage is possible, peek under the hood for more
    information

        perldoc -m Getopt::Usaginator

    An example:

        use Getopt::Usaginator
            # Called with the error
            error => sub { ... },
            # Called when usage printing is needed
            usage => sub { ... },
            ...
        ;

An example with Getopt::Long parsing
        use Getopt::Usaginator ...

        sub run {
            my $self = shift;
            my @arguments = @_;
    
            usage 0 unless @arguments;

            my ( $help );
            {     
                local @ARGV = @arguments;                                  
                GetOptions(
                    'help|h|?' => \$help,
                );
            }

            usage 0 if $help;

            ...
        }
