- POD for add-memo.
- Add support for general-purpose parsers: read the database type (PDB
  or PRC), creator, and type, and look them up in a database. This
  should return the name of a Perl module to use to parse that
  particular database type.
	The best way of doing this appears to be

	sub load_module
	{
		eval "require $_[0]";
		die if $@;
		$_[0]->import($_[1..$#_]);
	}
  See "Perl Cookbook," 12.3.
- Add PRC support. Unlike PDBs, the thing to do here is to have
  registered handlers for various resource types.
- Add PQA parser.
- Make $VERSION be a floating-point number. See mail from Andreas J.
