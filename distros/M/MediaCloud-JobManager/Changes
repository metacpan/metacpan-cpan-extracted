Revision history for Perl module MediaCloud::JobManager (ex. Gearman::JobScheduler)

0.26   2016-11-21
    * Make number of RabbitMQ connect retries configurable.

0.25   2016-06-09
    * Fix broker initialization problem.

0.24   2016-06-09
    * Remove Gearman support.
    * Remove obsolete dependencies.
    * Upgrade Net::AMQP::RabbitMQ.

0.23   2016-06-02
    * Make job result (response) queues optional because they fill up
      RabbitMQ's queue list for clients that don't care about job results.
    * Remake per-function priorities into per-job priorities (passed as an
      argument to run_remotely() or add_to_queue()) because they make more
      sense.
    * Sort job arguments in job log.

0.22   2016-05-30
    * Add support for RabbitMQ's "lazy queues"
      (https://www.rabbitmq.com/lazy-queues.html, configurable per-function) to
      handle large queues without a huge memory pressure.

0.21   2016-05-27
    * Retry connecting to RabbitMQ for a minute when starting a client.
    * Don't print default job priority when starting a worker.

0.20   2016-05-04
    * Remove unique() from workers because RabbitMQ doesn't support merging
      jobs with identical arguments into one.
    * Don't use PIDs for RabbitMQ channel numbers.

0.19   2016-05-03
    * Add basic RabbitMQ job broker support using Celery as message protocol.

0.18   2016-04-27
    * Use CPAN's preferred versioning.

0.17.1 2016-04-27
    * Copy mjm_worker.pl to bin/.

0.17   2016-04-26
    * Rename from Gearman::JobScheduler to MediaCloud::JobManager.
    * Rename run_on_gearman() to run_remotely().
    * Rename enqueue_on_gearman() to add_to_queue().
    * Refactor the module to be job broker-agnostic in order to later add
      additional job broker support (e.g. RabbitMQ via Celery protocol).
    * Modernize Makefile.PL.
    * Update README.

0.16.1   2016-04-20
    * Remove Log::Log4perl's error log appender because together with Media
      Cloud's usage of Log::Log4perl it ends up in a deep recursion.

0.16   2014-07-01
    * Fix support for Perl 5.19+.
    * Remove support for "timeout()" subroutine because it wasn't working as
      expected.
    * Add basic, sanity checking unit tests.
    * Add compile test.
    * Fix list of module dependencies.

0.15   2014-02-18
    * Add FILENO() subroutine to Gearman::JobScheduler::ErrorLogTrapper because
      otherwise IPC::Open3 fails (see
      http://stackoverflow.com/a/6012757/200603).

0.14   2014-02-05
    * Remove fork()-based workers because they're more of a bug than a feature;
      clients should run separate processes instead.
    * Use JSON instead of Storable to encode / decode job arguments in order to
      improve compatibility with Gearman clients / workers in other languages.

0.13   2014-02-03
    * Sanitize function name when writing to a single ("unified") log.

0.12   2014-02-03
    * Added support for writing worker logs into a single file.
    * Print job arguments into a single line for clarity.

0.11   2013-11-19
    * Got rid of the Sys::Path dependency because it doesn't work on Perl 5.18
      without warnings (requires JSON::Util -> IO::Any -> uses "~~" and "given"
      which emit warnings).

0.10   2013-11-18
    * Got rid of an outdated/experimental "given-when" syntax so Perl 5.18
      doesn't complain.
    * Dropped leading 'v' off versions to satisfy CPAN::Changes::Spec.
    * Added GitHub repo to Build.PL / META.yml.

0.09   2013-10-28
    * Make "unique_job_id()" public for the use of client applications because
      they might want to generate their own unique job IDs in order to test
      whether or not a job with given parameters is enqueued.

0.08   2013-10-21
    * Gearman::JobScheduler::Admin utility package for administering the
      server (just like "gearadmin" does).
    * Removed Gearman::JobScheduler::cancel_gearman_job() subroutine as
      redundant.
    * Don't die() when a log path is not found.
    * Added Gearman/JobScheduler/Worker.pm to the list of "provided" files.

0.07   2013-10-07
    * Moose 2.1005 requirement.

0.06   2013-10-07
    * Handle (log) undefined arguments to run() correctly.

0.05   2013-10-07
    * Use SHA256 hashes for Perl-generated unique job identifiers because the
      job identifier is limited to 64 bytes by Gearman which is usually not
      enough.

0.04   2013-09-30
    * Ability to start multiple worker instances of a single Gearman function.

0.03   2013-09-30
    * Gearman functions can now provide their own default configurations.

0.02   2013-09-30
    * Moved worker helper subroutines to a separate package so that they can be
      reused more easily.

0.01   2013-09-16
    * Initial release.
