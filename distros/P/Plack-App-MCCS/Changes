	- Bugfix: assign the correct path to the filehandle when reading the
	  minified file. This also allows windows tests to pass.
      - Bugfix: tests would fail if JavaScript::Minifier::XS and
        CSS::Minifier::XS were not installed
	- add autodie to protect against ignored errors in file operations
	- add min_cache_dir to reduce pollution with files that are hard to
	  filter

	- Bugfix: bin/mccs did not parse the root directory from the command
