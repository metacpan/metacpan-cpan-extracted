NAME
    Alien::hdt_java - Find or build hdt-java (RDF binary format library)

SYNOPSIS
    Command line tool:

     use Alien::hdt_java;
     use Env qw( @PATH );

     unshift @PATH, Alien::hdt_java->bin_dir;

DESCRIPTION
    This distribution provides hdt-java so that it can be used by other Perl
    distributions that are on CPAN. It does this by first trying to detect
    an existing install of hdt-java on your system. If found it will use
    that. If it cannot be found, the source code will be downloaded from the
    internet and it will be installed in a private share location for the
    use of other modules.
