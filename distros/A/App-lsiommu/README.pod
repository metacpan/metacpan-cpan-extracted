=head1 DESCRIPTION

L<This script|http://github.com/a3f/.dotfiles/blob/master/bin/lsiommu> packaged as CPAN module.
Isolation/pass-through of devices via IOMMU is only possible in groups.
This script reads the groups out the Linux SysFS and displays them as a tree.
If C<lspci(1)> is available, it's used to display full device information.
