- The generated tests are now added as "xt/author/pp-*". This lets other
  Dist::Zilla plugins which handle tests under xt do the right thing.

- The generated tests no longer include their own "only run under
  RELEASE_TESTING" block. This is handled by whatever plugin you might use to
  handle tests in xt/.

- When making pure Perl copies of test files, this plugin now skips
  Dist::Zilla::File::InMemory objects. These are typically added by other
  plugins like Test::EOL or Test::Compile, and there's no usually no point in
  testing them twice. Some plugins (like Test::Compile) are implemented in a
  way that copying the test file ends up generating a broken test, and this
  avoid that problem.
