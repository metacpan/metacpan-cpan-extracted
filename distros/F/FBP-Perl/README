NAME
    FBP::Perl - Generate Perl GUI code from wxFormBuilder .fbp files

SYNOPSIS
      my $fbp = FBP->new;
      $fbp->parse_file( 'MyProject.fbp' );
      
  my $generator = FBP::Perl->new(
          project => $fbp->project
      );
      
  open( FILE, '>', 'MyDialog.pm');
      print $generator->flatten(
          $generator->dialog_class(
              $fbp->dialog('MyDialog')
          )
      );
      close FILE;

DESCRIPTION
    FBP::Perl is a cross-platform Perl code generator for the cross-platform
    <wxFormBuilder> GUI designer application.

    Used with the FBP module for parsing native wxFormBuilder save files, it
    allows the production of complete standalone classes representing a
    complete Wx dialog, frame or panel as it appears in wxFormBuilder.

    As code generators go, the Wx code produced by FBP::Perl is remarkebly
    readable. The produced code can be used either as a starter template
    which you modify, or as a pristine class which you subclass in order to
    customise.

    Born from the Padre Perl IDE project, the code generation API provided
    by FBP::Perl is also extremely amenable to being itself subclassed.

    This allows you to relatively easily write customised code generators
    that produce output more closely tailored to your large Wx-based
    application, or to automatically integrate Perl Tidy or other
    beautifiers into your workflow.
