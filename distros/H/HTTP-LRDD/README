NAME
    HTTP::LRDD - link-based resource descriptor discovery

SYNOPSIS
     use HTTP::LRDD;
 
     my $lrdd        = HTTP::LRDD->new;
     my @descriptors = $lrdd->discover($resource);
     foreach my $descriptor (@descriptors)
     {
       my $description = $lrdd->parse($descriptor);
       # $description is an RDF::Trine::Model
     }

DESCRIPTION
    Note: the LRDD specification has ceased to be, with some parts being
    merged into the host-meta Internet Draft. This CPAN module will go in
    its own direction, bundling up best-practice techniques for discovering
    links and descriptors for a given URI.

  Import Routine
    "use HTTP::LRDD (@predicates)"
        When importing HTTP::LRDD, you can optionally provide a list of
        predicate URIs (i.e. the URIs which rel values expand to). This may
        also include IANA-registered link types, which are short tokens
        rather than full URIs. If you do not provide a list of predicate
        URIs, then a sensible default set is used.

        Because this configuration is global in nature, it is not
        recommended. It is better to supply a list of predicates to the
        constructor instead, or rely on the defaults. This feature should be
        regarded as deprecated.

  Constructors
    "HTTP::LRDD->new(@predicates)"
        Create a new LRDD discovery object using the given predicate URIs.
        If @predicates is omitted, then the predicates passed to the import
        routine are used instead.

    "HTTP::LRDD->new_strict"
        Create a new LRDD discovery object using the 'describedby' and
        'lrdd' IANA-registered predicates.

    "HTTP::LRDD->new_default"
        Create a new LRDD discovery object using the default set of
        predicates ('describedby', 'lrdd', 'wdrs:describedby', 'xhv:meta'
        and 'rdfs:seeAlso').

  Public Methods
    "$lrdd->discover($resource_uri)"
        Discovers a descriptor for the given resource; or if called in a
        list context, a list of descriptors.

        A descriptor is a resource that provides a description for
        something. So, if the given resource URI was the web address for an
        image, then the descriptor might be the web address for a metadata
        file about the image. If the given URI was an e-mail address, then
        the descriptor might be a profile document for the person to whom
        the address belongs.

        The following sources are checked (in order) to find links to
        descriptors.

        *   HTTP response headers ("Link" header; "303 See Other" status)

        *   HTTP response message (RDF or RDFa)

        *   https://HOSTNAME/.well-known/host-meta

        *   http://HOSTNAME/.well-known/host-meta

        If none of the above is able to yield a link to a descriptor, then
        the resource URI itself may be returned if it is in a
        self-describing format (e.g. RDF).

        There is no guaranteed file format for the descriptor, but it is
        usually RDF, POWDER XML or XRD.

        This method can also be called without an object (as a class method)
        in which case, a temporary object is created automatically using
        "new".

    "$lrdd->parse($descriptor_uri)"
        Parses a descriptor in XRD or RDF (RDF/XML, RDFa, Turtle, etc).

        Returns an RDF::Trine::Model or undef if unable to process.

        This method can also be called without an object (as a class method)
        in which case, a temporary object is created automatically using
        "new".

    "$lrdd->process($resource_uri)"
        Performs the equivalent of "discover" and "parse" in one easy step.

        Calls "discover" in a non-list context, so only the first descriptor
        is used.

    "$lrdd->process_all($resource_uri)"
        Performs the equivalent of "discover" and "parse" in one easy step.

        Calls "discover" in a list context, so multiple descriptors are
        combined into the resulting graph.

EXAMPLES
    Discover the hub address (PubSubHubub) for a feed:

     my $lrdd = HTTP::LRDD->new('hub');
     my $hub  = $lrdd->discover('http://example.net/feed.atom');

    Discover an author link (rel="author") from an HTML page:

     my $lrdd   = HTTP::LRDD->new('author');
     my $author = $lrdd->discover('http://example.com/page.html');

    (For RDF people, you should note that rel="author" is not semantically
    equivalent to the "foaf:maker" property but closer to the
    "foaf:maker/foaf:homepage" SPARQL 1.1 property path - i.e. the
    rel="author" link destination is not a URI for the author themselves,
    but a page about the author.)

    If that author resource is in a machine-readable format (e.g. RDF), then
    parse the data:

     my $author_data = $lrdd->parse($author);

    Or, you can combine "discover" and "parse":

     my $lrdd        = HTTP::LRDD->new('author');
     my $author_data = $lrdd->process('http://example.com/page.html');

    Get metadata for an image:

     my $lrdd = HTTP::LRDD->new;
     my $data = $lrdd->process_all('http://example.org/flower.jpeg');

    As we're not passing any arguments to the constructor, we can use a
    shortcut:

     my $data = HTTP::LRDD->process_all('http://example.org/flower.jpeg');

    Find the title of the image:

     use RDF::QueryX::Lazy;
 
     my $image   = q<http://example.org/flower.jpeg>;
     my $results = RDF::QueryX::Lazy
       -> new("SELECT * WHERE { <$image> dc:title ?t }")
       -> execute( HTTP::LRDD->process_all($image) );

BUGS
    Please report any bugs to <http://rt.cpan.org/>.

    Note: many problems can stem from servers that send incorrect
    "Content-Type" headers. If you send an XRD file as "text/html", then
    this module will not guess what you're doing - it will assume the file
    is really HTML, and inspect it for RDFa. For host-meta files, this
    module is slightly more relaxed, as there's a strong assumption that
    they are XRD... but YOU SHOULD NOT RELY ON THIS. If you're running a
    server, use the correct media type.
