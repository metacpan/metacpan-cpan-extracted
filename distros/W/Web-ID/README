NAME
    Web::ID - implementation of WebID (a.k.a. FOAF+SSL)

SYNOPSIS
     my $webid = Web::ID->new(certificate => $pem_encoded_x509);
     if ($webid->valid)
     {
       say "Authenticated as: ", $webid->uri;
     }

DESCRIPTION
    WebID is a simple authentication protocol based on TLS (Transaction Layer
    Security, better known as Secure Socket Layer, SSL) and the Semantic Web.
    This module provides a Perl implementation for authenticating clients
    using WebID.

    For more information see the Web::ID::FAQ document.

    Bundled with this module are Plack::Middleware::Auth::WebID, a plugin for
    Plack to perform WebID authentication on HTTPS connections; and
    Web::ID::Certificate::Generator, a module that allows you to generate
    WebID-enabled certificates that can be installed into web browsers.

  Constructor
    `new`
        Standard Moose-style constructor.

  Attributes
    `certificate`
        A Web::ID::Certificate object representing and x509 certificate,
        though a PEM-encoded string will be coerced.

        This is usually the only attribute you want to pass to the
        constructor. Allow the others to be built automatically.

    `first_valid_san`
        Probably fairly uninteresting. This is the first subjectAltName value
        found in the certificate that could be successfully authenticated
        using Web::ID. An Web::ID::SAN object.

    `uri`
        The URI associated with the first valid SAN. A URI object.

        This is a URI you can use to identify the person, organisation or
        robotic poodle holding the certificate.

    `profile`
        Data about the certificate holder. An RDF::Trine::Model object. Their
        FOAF file (probably).

    `valid`
        Boolean.

  Methods
    `node`
        Returns the same as `uri`, but as an RDF::Trine::Node object.

    `get(@predicates)`
        Queries the `profile` for triples of the form:

          $self->node $predicate $x .

        And returns literal and URI values for $x, as strings.

        $predicate should be an RDF::Trine::Node, or a string. If a string, it
        will be expanded using RDF::Trine::NamespaceMap, so you can do stuff
        like:

          my $name   = $webid->get('foaf:name', 'rdfs:label');
          my @mboxes = $webid->get('foaf:mbox');

    Web::ID::Certificate, Plack::Middleware::Auth::WebID.

    RDF::ACL provides an access control system that complements WebID.

    CGI::Auth::FOAF_SSL is the spiritual ancestor of this module though they
    share very little code, and have quite different APIs.

THANKS
    Thanks to Kjetil Kjernsmo (cpan:KJETILK) for persuading me to port my old
    CGI-specific implementaton of this to Plack.

    Thanks Kjetil Kjernsmo (again), Florian Ragwitz (cpan:FLORA), and Jonas
    Smedegaard for help with testing and advice on dependencies.

    Thanks to Henry Story, Melvin Carvalho, Simon Reinhardt, Bruno Harbulot,
    Ian Jacobi and many others for developing WebID from a poorly thought out
    idea to a clever, yet simple and practical authentication protocol.

    Thanks to Gregory Williams (cpan:GWILLIAMS), Tatsuhiko Miyagawa
    (cpan:MIYAGAWA) and the Moose Cabal for providing really good platforms
    (RDF::Trine, Plack and Moose respectively) to build this on.
