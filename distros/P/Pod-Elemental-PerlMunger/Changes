Revision history for Pod-Elemental-PerlMunger

0.200006  2016-04-24 19:22:40+01:00 Europe/London
        - strip leading BOM (well, U+FEFF) from input
        - pass text, not bytes, to PPI

0.200005  2016-04-24 16:17:30+01:00 Europe/London
        - avoid double-decoding; new pod is already text

0.200004  2016-04-24 10:50:23+01:00 Europe/London
        - decode the fully new document, not just the Perl part
          (thanks, van-de-bugger and perlancar)

0.200003  2015-07-17 18:29:02-04:00 America/New_York
        - replace use of List::AllUtils with List::Util

0.200002  2014-03-20 19:13:01-04:00 America/New_York
        - the comment replacer now uses "#pod" not "#" to build replacement
          text, making it easier to strip out with grep (thanks, Karen
          Etheridge)

0.200001  2014-01-12 15:46:22-05:00 America/New_York
        - there's now also a post_code_replacer, used to generate replacements
          for Pod removed after the final bits of code, in case you were only
          worried about affecting code line numbers

0.200000  2014-01-11 14:23:46-05:00 America/New_York
        - it's now possible to replace Pod with something rather than nothing
          when it's extracted from your document; check out the "replacer"
          attribute

0.100000  2014-01-07 20:02:01-05:00 America/New_York
        - encode character string input into octets for PPI, then ensure output
          is also characters

0.093333  2013-10-09 17:17:00 America/New_York
          update bugtracker and repo data

0.093332  2012-08-24 21:03:56 America/New_York
          if there's nothing after __END__ but whitespace (after removing POD)
          then place the munged POD there.  Also, place a blank line
          between __END__ and the POD (thanks, Christopher J. Madsen!)

0.093331  2011-09-19 15:52:00 America/New_York
          some speed improvements by changing how we use PPI (thanks, Dave
          Rolsky!)

0.093330  2009-11-29 08:43:08 America/New_York
          throw exception if PPI parsing fails

0.093020  2009-10-28
          first release
