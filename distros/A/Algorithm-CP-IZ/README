Algorithm-CP-IZ version 0.03
============================

Algorithm::CP::IZ is an interface to iZ-C constraint programming library.
This modules contains XS wrapper and simple OO interface.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

Makefile.PL takes following command line options to specify path to iZ-C.

  -I path_to_iz_h

    Used to specify path to "iz.h".
    (environment variable IZ_INC_DIR and some default directories are
     used as default)

  -L path_to_libiz_so

    Used to specify path to "libiz.so"
    (environment variable IZ_LIB_DIR and some default directories are
     used as default)

   On Linux platform, libiz.so must be symblic link to libiz.so.3, and
   libiz.so.3 must be symbolic link to libiz.so.3.x.x. Create these
   links if not exist.

   On Windows platfrom (strawberry perl), you need two steps before make.
     1. Remove CTRL-Z exists end of iz.h. (EOF character of good old CP/M)
     2. Generate libiz.a from iz.dll.
        (see http://www.mingw.org/wiki/msvc_and_mingw_dlls)
        
        $ pexports iz.dll > libiz.def
        $ dlltool -d libiz.def -l libiz.a

   And use "gmake" instead of make command.
