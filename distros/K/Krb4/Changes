1.1     Fix PL_ macros for Perl 5.6 compatibility.

1.0	First production release.
	Moved module into the Authen:: namespace.  This should get the Krb4
	on the main module list, making it easier to find.

0.93	Implemented get_svc_in_tkt, read_service_key, and dest_tkt.
	Added DESTROY methods for all Krb4 objects to avoid memory leaks.

0.92	Replaced system memory functions with Perl macros.
	Implemented krb_get_pw_in_tkt for password authentication.
	Better sample code, including both client and server scripts.
	Cleaned up some code to make compilation somewhat quieter.

0.91	Implemented sendauth and recvauth.  Fixed a bug in mk_priv and
	rd_priv where empty strings weren't being encrypted/decrypted
	correctly.  Cleaned up some of the code.

0.9	Added object oriented interface.  Beta version released.
