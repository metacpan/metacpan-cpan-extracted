=head1 NAME

B<Nama> - digital audio workstation

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<nama> [I<options>] [I<project_name>]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<Nama> performs multitrack recording, effects processing,
editing, mixing, mastering, live performance and
general-purpose audio processing, using the Ecasound
realtime audio engine.

=head2 Audio Functionality

Audio projects may be developed using tracks, buses,
effects, sends, inserts, marks, regions, fades, sequences
and edits.  Each track may contain one or more WAV files,
which may be recorded or imported.

Effects processing by LADSPA, LV2 and Ecasound
plugins may be performed in realtime, or cached (e.g.
frozen) to a file. The user may toggle between cached and
dynamic processing for a track. Audio regions may be
altered, duplicated, time-shifted or replaced.  

Nama supports MIDI functionality via midish. 

=head2 Presets and templates

To facilitate reuse, a track's plugins and inserts can be
stored as an effect chain.  Effect profiles and project
templates provide templating for groups of tracks and entire
projects, respectively.

=head2 Audio framework

Audio IO is via JACK or ALSA. Soundcard IO is normally
routed to JACK with transparent fallback to ALSA.

=head2 Persistence

Project data parameters related to audio configuration are
serialized as JSON and tracked using Git when available. The
entire project history is retained and may be managed using
branches and tags.

Nama supports Ladish Level 1 session handling.

=head2 User interfaces

Nama has fully featured terminal command prompt, a Tk
GUI, and experimental OSC and remote-command modes.
 
The command prompt accepts Nama commands, Ecasound
interactive-mode commands, shell commands and perl code.

It has command history and autocompletion.  The help
system provides documentation and keyword search 
covering Nama commands and effects.

The hotkey mode provides a convenient way to select, view,
and modify effect parameters.

By default, Nama displays a graphic user interface while
the command processor runs in a terminal window.

=head1 CONTROLLING NAMA/ECASOUND

The Ecasound audio engine is configured through use of
I<chain setups> that specify the signal processing network.

Nama serves as an intermediary, taking high-level commands
from the user, generating appropriate chain setups for user
tasks such as recording, playback, mixing, etc., and running
the audio engine.

=head2 Configuration Commands

Configuration commands affect I<future> runs of the audio
engine.  For example, B<rec, play, mon> and B<off> determine
whether the current track will get its audio stream from an
external (e.g. live) source, whether an existing WAV file
will be played back, and whether a new WAV file will be
recorded. Nama responds to these commands by reconfiguring
the engine and displaying the updated track status. See 'man
::ChainSetup' for details on how the chain setup created.

=head2 Realtime Commands

Once a chain setup is loaded and the engine is launched,
commands can be issued to control the realtime behavior of
the audio processing engine. These commands include
transport C<start> and C<stop>, playback repositioning
commands such C<forward>, C<rewind> and C<setpos>. Effects
may be added, modified or removed while the engine is
running.

=head2 Configuration

General configuration of sound devices and program options
is performed by editing the F<.namarc> file. On Nama's first
run, a default version of F<.namarc> is usually placed in
the user's home directory. 

=head1 Tk GRAPHICAL UI 

Invoked by default if Tk is installed, this interface
provides a subset of Nama's functionality on two
windows: 

=head2 Main Window

The top section has buttons for creating, loading and saving
projects, adding tracks, adding effects to tracks. In
short, for setup.

Below are buttons for controlling the transport (start, stop
and friends) and for setting marks. 

The GUI project name bar and time display change color to
indicate whether the upcoming operation will include live
recording (red), mixdown (yellow) or playback (green).

=head2 Effects Window

The B<effects window> provides sliders for each effect
parameter of each track. Parameter range, defaults, and log/linear
scaling hints are automatically detected. Text-entry widgets
are used to enter parameters values for plugins without
hinted ranges. Any parameter label can be clicked to 
add a parameter controller.

=head2 Terminal Window 

The command prompt is available in the terminal window
during GUI operation. Text commands are used to access
Nama's more advanced functions.

=head1 TEXT USER INTERFACE

Press the I<Enter> key if necessary to get the 
command prompt, which will look something like this:

=over 12

C<nama sax ('h' for help)E<gt>>

=back

In this instance, 'sax' is the current track.

When using buses, the bus is indicated before the track:

=over 12

C<nama Strings/violin ('h' for help)E<gt>>

=back

At the prompt, you can enter Nama and Ecasound commands, Perl code
preceded by C<eval> or shell code preceded by C<!>.

Multiple commands on a single line are allowed if delimited
by semicolons. Usually the lines are split on semicolons and
the parts are executed sequentially, however if the line
begins with C<eval> or C<!> the entire line (up to double
semicolons ';;' if present) will be given to the
corresponding interpreter.

You can access command history using up-arrow/down-arrow.

Type C<help> for general help, C<help command> for help with
C<command>, C<help foo> for help with commands containing
the string C<foo>. C<help_effect foo bar> lists all 
plugins/presets/controller containing both I<foo> and
I<bar>. Tab-completion is provided for Nama commands, Ecasound-iam
commands, plugin/preset/controller names, and project names.

Many effects have abbreviations, such as 'afx' for
'add_effect'. 

=head1 TRACKS

Each track has a descriptive name (i.e. vocal) and an
integer track-number assigned when the track is created.
New user tracks initially belong to the Main bus.

Track output signals are usually mixed and pass through the
Master track on the way to soundcard for monitoring.

The following sections describes track attributes and
their effects.

=head2 Width

Specifying 'mono' means the track has one input channel, which
will be recorded as a mono WAV file. Mono track signals are
automatically duplicated to stereo and a pan effect is provided.

Specifying 'stereo' for a track means that two channels of
audio input will be recorded as an interleaved stereo WAV
file.  You can also use a 'stereo' declaration to avoid the
automatic channel copy usually applied to single-channel
sources.

Specifying N channels for a track ('set width N') means N
successive input channels will be recorded as an N-channel
interleaved WAV file.

=head2 REC/PLAY/MON/OFF

Each track, including Master and Mixdown, has its own
REC/MON/PLAY/OFF setting.
 
The I<MON> setting means that the track source is connected to
the track input, and the track output is supplied for
monitoring by the Main bus and other submixes if any.

The I<REC> setting prepares the track is ready to record a
WAV file.

The I<PLAY> setting enqueues an audio file for playback
from disk as the track source.
 
I<REC> and I<PLAY> settings also create the monitoring
routes associated with I<MON> status.

I<OFF> setting tells Nama to remove the track from the audio
network. I<OFF> status also results when no audio source is
available. A track with no recorded WAV files
will show OFF status, even if set to PLAY.

=head3 Bus setting

Buses can force the status of their member tracks to OFF.
Nama provides MON and OFF settings for buses.
OFF (set by C<bus_off>) removes all member tracks from the chain
setup, MON (set by C<bus_mon> restores them.

The B<mixplay> command sets the Mixdown track to PLAY and the
Main bus to OFF.

=head2 Version Numbers

Multiple WAV files ("takes") can be recorded for each track. These are
distinguished by a version number that increments with each
recording run, i.e. F<sax_1.wav>, F<sax_2.wav>, etc.  All
WAV files recorded in the same run have the same version
numbers.

The version numbers of files for playback can be selected at
the bus or track level. By setting the bus version
to 5, you can play back version 5 of several tracks
at once. Version 5 could signify the fifth take of a song, or
the fifth song of a live recording session. 

The track version setting, if present, overrides the bus
setting. Setting the track version to zero restores control
of the version number to the bus.

The Main bus version setting does I<not> currently propagate to
other buses. 

=head2 Marks

Marks in Nama are similar to those in other audio editing
software. One limitation is that mark positions are relative
to the beginning of an Ecasound chain setup. If your project
involves a single track, and you will be shortening the
stream by setting a region to play, set any marks you need
I<after> defining the region.

=head2 Regions

The C<region> command allows you to define endpoints for a
portion of an audio file. You can then use the C<shift>
command to move the region to the desired time position.

Each track can have one region definition. To create
multiple regions, the C<new_region> command takes a pair of
marks to create a read-only copy of the current track with
the specified region definition. 

You can control this region as you would any other other
track, applying effects, adjusting volume, etc.

Currently, regions are not clipped out of their host track.
This feature may be implemented in future.

=head3 Using Tracks from Other Projects

The C<link_track> clones a read-only track from
another track, which may belong to a different project. 

=head2 Effects

Each track gets volume and pan effects by default.  New
effects added using C<add_effect> are applied before pan
volume controls.  You can position effects anywhere you
choose using C<insert_effect> or C<position_effect>.

=head3 Fades

Nama allows you to place fades on any track. Fades are
defined by mark position and duration. An additional volume
operator, -eadb, is applied to each track to host the
envelope controller that implements fades.

=head3 Sends and Inserts

The C<send> command can route a track's post-fader output
to a soundcard channel or JACK client in addition to the
normal mixer input. Nama currently allows one aux send per
track.

The C<add_insert> command configures a pre- or post-fader
send-and-return to soundcard channels or JACK clients.
Wet and dry signal paths are provided, with a default
setting of 100% wet.

Each track can have one pre-fader and one post-fader insert.

=head2 Bunches

A bunch is just a list of track names. Bunch names are used
with the keyword C<for> to apply one or more commands to several
tracks at once. A bunch can be created with the C<new_bunch>
command. Any bus name can also be treated as a bunch.
Finally, several system defined bunches are available:

=over 12

=item B<rec>, B<mon>, B<off>

All tracks with the corresponding I<setting> in the current bus

=back

=head2 Buses

=head3 Sub Buses

B<Buses> enable multiple tracks to be routed through a
single mix track before feeding the Main mixer bus (or
possibly, another bus.) 

The following commands create a bus and assign
three tracks to it. The mix track takes the name of
the bus and is stereo by default.

	# create a bus named Strings with a same-named mix track
	add_bus Strings 

	# create tracks for the bus
	add_tracks violin cello bass

	# move the tracks from the Main bus (default) to the Strings bus
	for violin cello bass; move_to_bus Strings

	# use the mix track to control bus output volume
	Strings vol - 10

=head3 Submixes

B<Submixes> are a type of bus used to provide instrument
monitors, or to send the outputs from multiple user tracks
to an external program such as jconverter.

=head1 ROUTING

=head2 General Notes

While Nama can address tracks by either name and track number,
the chain setups use the track number exclusively.

The Master track (mixer output control) is always
chain 1, the Mixdown track is always chain 2.

In single-engine mode, Nama uses Ecasound loop devices where
necessary to connect two tracks, or to allow one track to
have multiple inputs or outputs. Each loop device adds one
buffer, which increases latency.  In dual-engine mode, JACK
ports are used for interconnections instead of loop devices. 

=head2 Flow Diagrams

The following diagrams apply to Nama's single-engine, mode.
(The same topology is used in dual-engine mode.)

Let's examine the signal flow from track 3, the first 
available user track. Assume track 3 is named "sax".

We will divide the signal flow into track and mixer
sections.  Parentheses show the track number/name.

The stereo outputs of each user track terminate at 
Master_in, a loop device at the mixer input.

=head3 Track, REC status

    Sound device   --+---(3)----> Master_in
      /JACK client   |
                     +---(R3)---> sax_1.wav

REC status indicates that the source of the signal is the
soundcard or JACK client. The input signal will be written
directly to a file except in the special preview and doodle
modes, or if C<rec_disable> is issued.

=head3 Track, MON status

    sax_1.wav ------(3)----> Master_in

=head3 Mixer, with mixdown enabled

In the second part of the flow graph, the mixed signal is
delivered to an output device through the Master chain,
which can host effects. Usually the Master track
provides final control before audio output or mixdown.

    Master_in --(1)--> Master_out --+--------> Sound device
                                    |
                                    +-->(2)--> Mixdown_1.wav

=head3 Mastering Mode

In mastering mode (invoked by C<master_on> and released
C<master_off>) the following network, receives the Master
track signal as input and provides an output to the
soundcard or WAV file.

                       +- Low -+ 
                       |       |
    Master_in --- Eq --+- Mid -+--- Boost -> soundcard/wav_out
                       |       |
                       +- High + 

The B<Eq> track hosts an equalizer.

The B<Low>, B<Mid> and B<High> tracks each apply a bandpass
filter, a compressor and a spatialiser.

The B<Boost> track applies gain and a limiter.

These effects and their default parameters are defined
in the configuration file F<.namarc>.

=head2 Mixdown

The C<mixdown> command configures Nama for mixdown. The
Mixdown track is set to REC (equivalent to C<Mixdown rec>)
and the audio monitoring output is turned off (equivalent to
C<Master off>).

Mixdown proceeds after you start the transport.

As a convenience, Mixdown_nn.wav will be symlinked to
F<<branch_name>_nn.wav> in the project directory. (If git is
disabled or not available F<<project_name>_nn.wav> is used
instead.)  Corresponding encoded files are created if the
"mixdown_encodings" option is set. Acceptable values are a
space-separated list. The default is "mixdown_encodings: ogg
mp3".

=head2 The Preview and Doodle Modes, and the Eager Setting

These non-recording modes, invoked by C<preview> and
C<doodle> commands tweak the routing rules for special
purposes. B<Preview mode> disables recording of WAV files
to disk. B<Doodle mode> disables PLAY inputs while
excluding any tracks with the same source as a currently
routed track. The C<arm> command releases both preview and
doodle modes.

The eager setting causes the engine to start immediately
following a reconfiguration.

These modes are unnecessary in Nama's dual-engine mode.

=head2 Saving Projects

The C<save> command is the usual way to
preserve your work.

When you type C<save>, Settings related to the state of the
project are saved in the file F<State.json> in the current
project directory. F<State.json> is tracked by git.

C<save> updates several other data files as well:

F<Aux.json>, in the current project directory, contains
data that is part of the project (such as command history,
track comments, and current operating modes) but with no direct 
effect on the project audio.  

F<global_effect_chains.json>, in the project root directory,
contains system and user defined effect chains.

=head3 Save without Git

C<save somename.json> will save project state to a file of
that name.  Similarly C<get somename.json> will load the
corresponding file. The F<.json> suffix may be omitted if
"use_git: 0" is set in F<.namarc>.

=head3 Save with Git

When git is installed, Nama uses it to store snapshots of
every step in the history of your project.

While you can continue using the same C<save> and C<get> 
with snapshots, the underlying version control gives
them huge advantages over files: (1) they can sprout
branches, (2) they retain their history and (3) they are
never overwritten. 

When you type C<save initial-mix>, the latest snapshot is
tagged with the name "initial-mix", which you can recall
later with the command C<get initial-mix>. 

You can include a comment with the snapshot:

C<save initial-mix "sounds good enough to send to the front office">

Nama lets you create new branches, starting at any snapshot.

To start a new branch called I<compressed-mix> starting at a
snapshot called I<initial-mix> you would say:

C<new_branch compressed-mix initial-mix>

If you want to go back to working on the master branch, use
C<branch master>.

You can also issue native git commands at the Nama prompt.

=head3 Git history example

All projects begin on the "master" branch. Because this is
the default branch, it is not displayed in the prompt.
Otherwise "master" is not special in any way.

In the graphs below, the letters indicate
named snapshots.

    create test-project
    ...
    save a
    ...
    save b
    ...
    save c
    
    ---a---b---c (master)
    
    get a
    ...
    save d
    ...
    save e
    ...
    save f
    
           d---e---f (a-branch)
          /
    -----a----b---c (master)
    
Now, you want to go back to try something different at "c":

    get c
    ...
    save g
    
          d---e---f (a-branch)
         /
    ----a----b---c (master)
                  \
                   g (c-branch CURRENT HEAD)
    
You could also go back to master, and restart
from there:

    get master
    ...
    save h
    ...
    save i
    
          d---e---f (a-branch)
         /
    ----a----b---c---h---i (master CURRENT HEAD)
                  \
                   g (c-branch)
    
While the merging of branches may be possible, 
the function has not been tested.

=head2 Exiting

When you type C<quit> Nama will automatically save your work
to F<State.json>. If you I<don't> want this behavior, use
Ctrl-C to exit Nama.

=head2 Jack ports list file

Use I<source filename.ports> to ask Nama
to connect multiple JACK ports listed in a file
F<filename.ports> to the input
port(s) of that track.

If the track is stereo, ports from the list are alternately
connected to left and right channels.
 
=head2 Track edits

An edit consists of audio clips and data structures
associated with a particular track and version. The edit
replaces part of the original WAV file, allowing you to fix
wrong notes, or substitute one phrase for another.

Each track can host multiple edits. Edits are
non-destructive; they are achieved by using Ecasound's
ability to crossfade and sequence.

Select the track to be edited and the correct version.

Before creating the edit, you will now need to create three
marks:

=over 4

=item * play start point
=item * rec start point
=item * rec end point

=back

The edit will replace the audio between the rec start and
rec end points.

There are two ways to set these points.

=head3 set_edit_points command

Position the playback head a few seconds before the edit.
Enter the I<set_edit_points> command. This will start the
engine. Hit the B<P> key three times to designate the
playback start, punch-in and punch-out positions.

=head3 Specify points individually

Position the playback head at the position you want playback
for the edit to start. Enter the I<set_play_start_mark>
command.

Use the same procedure to set the rec start and rec end
positions using the I<set_rec_start_mark>
and I<set_rec_end_mark> commands.

=head3 Provide marks as arguments to I<new_edit> (not implemented)

Type I<new_edit play_start_mark rec_start_mark rec_end_mark>.)

=head3 Create the edit 

Enter the I<new_edit> command to create the necessary 
tracks and data structures.

Use I<preview_edit> to confirm the edit positions.  The
engine will run and you will hear the host track with the
target region removed. Playback will be restricted to the
edit region. You may use I<preview_out> to hear the clip to
be removed.

Use I<list_marks> to see the edit marks and I<modify_mark> 
to nudge them into perfect position.

Once you are satisfied with the mark positions, you are
ready to record your edit.

Enter I<start_edit>. Playback will begin at first mark. The
replacement clip will be recorded from the source specified
in the original track.

Each I<start_edit> command will record an additional version
on the edit track. I<redo_edit> will delete (destructively)
the most recent audio clip and begin recording anew.

You may specify another range for editing and use
the editing procedure again as many times as 
you like. Edits may not overlap.

=head3 Merging edits

I<merge_edits> will recursively merge all edits applied to
the current track and version, creating a new version.

I recommend that you merge edits when you are satisfied,
with the results to protect your edits against an accidental
change in mark, region or version settings. 

I<restore_edits> acts on a merged version of the current
track, selecting the prior unmerged version with all edits
and region definitions in "live" form.  You may continue to
create new edits. B<TO BE IMPLEMENTED>

I<list_edits> will label the edits by index and time.

I<end_edit_mode> will restore normal playback mode

I<destroy_edit>
Behind the scenes, the host track becomes the mix track to a
bus. Sources for the bus are the original audio track, and
zero or more edits, each represented by one track object.

=head1 REMOTE CONTROL

You can send now send commands from a remote process, and
also get information back. Understand that this code opens a
remote execution hole.

In F<.namarc> you need something like:

      remote_control_port: 57000

Then Nama will set up a listener for remote commands.

The usual return value will be a single newline.

However, if you send an 'eval' command followed by perl
code, the return value will be the result of the perl code
executed with a newline appended. If the result is a list,
the items will be joined by spaces into a single string.

If the result is an object or data structure, it will be
returned in a serialized form. 

For example, if you send this string:

      eval $this_track->name

The return value will be the name of the current track.

=head1 REALTIME OPERATION

Nama selects realtime or nonrealtime parameters based on the
B<realtime_profile>, B<ecasound_buffersize> and
B<ecasound_globals> fields in F<.namarc>. You can
optionally specify the buffersizes as a multiple of the JACK
period size. Note that for best realtime operation under
JACK you will have to configure jackd appropriately as well.

The B<realtime> and B<auto> profiles are useful when using
Nama/Ecasound for live fx processing or live monitoring.

The B<realtime> profile sets a small buffersize and other low
latency settings whenever a soundcard or JACK client is
connected. 

The B<nonrealtime> profile uses a bigger buffer, providing
extended margins for stable operation. It is suitable for
post-processing, or for recording without live monitoring
responsibilities.

The B<auto> profile defaults to nonrealtime settings. It
switches to realtime, low-latency settings when a track has
a live input.

=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

On any change in setup, the GUI display updates and
C<show_tracks> command is executed automatically showing
what to expect the next time the engine is started.

You can use the C<chains> command to verify the Ecasound
chain setup. (The Ecasound command C<cs-save-as mysetup.ecs>
will additionally store all engine data, effects as
well as routing.)

The C<dump> command displays data for the current track.
The C<dumpall> command shows all state that would be saved.

This is the same output that is written to the F<State.yml>
file when you issue the C<save> command.

=head1 BUGS AND LIMITATIONS

No latency compensation across signal paths is provided at
present. This feature is under development.

=head1 SECURITY CONCERNS

If you are using Nama with the NetECI interface (i.e. if
Audio::Ecasound is I<not> installed) you should block TCP
port 2868 if your computer is exposed to the Internet. 

=head1 INSTALLATION

The following commands, available on Unixlike systems with
Perl installed, will pull in Nama and other Perl libraries
required for text mode operation:

C<cpanm Audio::Nama>
-or-
C<PERL_MM_USE_DEFAULT=1 cpan Audio::Nama>

To use the GUI, you will need to install Tk:

C<cpanm Tk>

You may want to install Audio::Ecasound if you prefer not to
run Ecasound in server mode:

C<cpanm Audio::Ecasound>

You can pull the source code as follows: 

C<git clone git://github.com/bolangi/nama.git>

Consult the F<BUILD> file for build instructions.

=head1 SUPPORT

The Nama mailing list is a suitable forum for questions
regarding Nama installation, usage, bugs, feature requests, etc.
