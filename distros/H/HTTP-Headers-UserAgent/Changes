Revision history for Perl module HTTP::Headers::UserAgent

3.09 2015-11-11 NEILB
    - Updated github repo URL after changing my github username
    - Added [MetaJSON] to dist.ini so META.json is included in releases

3.08 2015-03-10
    - I should have specified min version for HTTP::BrowserDetect as 1.77,
      since switching to work with HTTP::BrowserDetect 1.77 meant tests
      fail with 1.76 and earlier. Thanks to SREZIC for pointing this out.

3.07 2015-03-09
    - Changes needed to get tests passing after a new version of
      HTTP::BrowserDetect (1.77) was released by OALDERS.

    - The doc was mistakenly saying that HTTP::BrowserDetect had been
      deprecated, instead of HTTP::Headers::UserAgent :-)
