Digest::SHA3 version 1.04
=========================

Digest::SHA3 is a complete implementation of the NIST SHA-3 cryptographic
hash function, known originally as Keccak.  It gives Perl programmers a
convenient way to calculate SHA3-224, SHA3-256, SHA3-384, and SHA3-512
message digests, as well as variable-length hashes using SHAKE128
and SHAKE256.  The module can handle all types of input, including
partial-byte data.

Digest::SHA3 is written in C for speed.  If your platform lacks a C
compiler, perhaps you can find the module in a binary form compatible
with your particular processor and operating system.

The initial version of Digest::SHA3 was written to emphasize simplicity
and correctness.  It passed all known-answer-tests for short and long
messages.  No particular emphasis was placed on performance.  However,
as the SHA-3 standard matures, versions of this module will endeavor to
perform on a par with optimized portable implementations.

The module omits all HMAC-SHA-3 functions until such time as official
test vectors become available.

The tests subdirectory (t/*.t) contains a set of test vectors compiled
from both official and informal sources.
