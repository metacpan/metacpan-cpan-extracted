NAME

    Test::OpenLDAP - Creates a temporary instance of OpenLDAP's slapd
    daemon to run tests against.

VERSION

    Version 0.71

SYNOPSIS

      my $slapd = Test::OpenLDAP->new(); # Test::OpenLDAP->new( suffix => 'dc=foobar,dc=com', 'debug' => '-1' );
    
      my $ldap = Net::LDAP->new($slapd->uri()) or Carp::croak("Failed to connect:$@");
    
      my $mesg = $ldap->bind($slapd->admin_user(), password => $slapd->admin_password());
    
      ... add / modify / search entries
    
      $slapd->stop();
    
      $slapd->start();
    
      $slapd->DESTROY();

DESCRIPTION

    This module allows easy creation and tear down of a OpenLDAP slapd
    instance. When the variable goes out of scope, the slapd instance is
    torn down and the file system objects it relies on are removed.

SUBROUTINES/METHODS

 new

    This method initialises and starts an OpenLDAP slapd instance,
    listening on a unix socket. It then creates an admin user and password
    and returns the slapd instance to the user. The method accepts a hash
    of configuration options. The following keys are currently accepted;

      * suffix - specifies the suffix that subsequent LDAP queries will be
      procesed under (e.g. 'dc=example,dc=org')

      * debug - the debug level of the slapd instance. To see valid values
      for debug, execute the command "slapd -d '?'". slapd will list all
      the valid debug levels. It defaults to '0' or no logging.

      * syslog - the debug level of the slapd instance for syslog. This
      parameter accepts the same values as the debug level. It defaults to
      '0' or no logging to syslog

 skip

    This method allows the user to skip tests requiring Test::OpenLDAP by
    checking to see if the slapd binary exists AND that the OS uses fork
    for process control.

 start

    This methods starts the slapd process

 start

    This method stops the slapd process

 uri

    This method gives the uri for the test code to connect to via a
    Net::LDAP->new() call.

 suffix

    This method gives the dn used as the suffix for the slapd database.

 admin_user

    This method gives the admin user name for the slapd database.

 admin_password

    This method gives the admin password for the slapd database.

 debug

    This method gives the debug level that the slapd instance is reporting.

 debug_handle

    This method gives a handle to the slapd debug log.

 set_cookie

    This method sets the value for the "-c" argument to slapd. This can be
    used to force a reload for a replication consumer.

 get_cookie

    This method gets the value for the "-c" argument to slapd.

 clear_cookie

    This method clears the value for the "-c" argument to slapd. This can
    be used to reset the cookie in between stopping and starting slapd

 new_db_directory

    This method creates and returns a new database directory (for
    subsequent use with the olcDbDirectory attribute)

DIAGNOSTICS

    slapd already started

      Each instance of Test::OpenLDAP may only start one instance of slapd
      at a time.

CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT

    Test::OpenLDAP requires no configuration files or environment
    variables.

DEPENDENCIES

    Test::OpenLDAP requires the following non-core Perl modules

      * Data::UUID

      * File::Temp

      * URI::Escape

      * Net::LDAP
