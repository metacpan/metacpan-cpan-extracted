NAME
    MooseX::Role::MongoDB - Provide MongoDB connections, databases and
    collections

VERSION
    version 1.000

SYNOPSIS
    In your module:

        package MyData;
        use Moose;
        with 'MooseX::Role::MongoDB';

        has database => (
            is       => 'ro',
            isa      => 'Str',
            required => 1,
        );

        has client_options => (
            is       => 'ro',
            isa      => 'HashRef',
            default  => sub { {} },
        );

        sub _build__mongo_default_database { return $_[0]->database }
        sub _build__mongo_client_options   { return $_[0]->client_options }

        sub do_stuff {
            my ($self) = @_;

            # get "test" database
            my $db = $self->_mongo_database("test");

            # get "books" collection from default database
            my $books = $self->_mongo_collection("books");

            # get "books" collection from another database
            my $other = $self->_mongo_collection("otherdb" => "books");

            # ... do stuff with them
        }

    In your code:

        my $obj = MyData->new(
            database => 'MyDB',
            client_options  => {
                host => "mongodb://example.net:27017",
                username => "willywonka",
                password => "ilovechocolate",
            },
        );

        $obj->do_stuff;

DESCRIPTION
    This role helps create and manage MongoDB objects. All MongoDB objects
    will be generated lazily on demand and cached. The role manages a single
    MongoDB::MongoClient connection, but many MongoDB::Database and
    MongoDB::Collection objects.

    The role also compensates for dropped connections and forks. If these
    are detected, the object caches are cleared and new connections and
    objects will be generated in the new process.

    Note that a lost connection will not be detectable until *after* an
    exception is thrown due to a failed operation.

    When using this role, you should not hold onto MongoDB objects for long
    if there is a chance of your code forking. Instead, request them again
    each time you need them.

REQUIREMENTS
  _logger
    You must provide a private method that returns a logging object. It must
    implement at least the "info" and "debug" methods. MooseX::Role::Logger
    version 0.002 or later is recommended, but other logging roles may be
    sufficient.

METHODS
  _mongo_database
        $obj->_mongo_database( $database_name );

    Returns a MongoDB::Database. The argument is the database name. With no
    argument, the default database name is used.

  _mongo_collection
        $obj->_mongo_collection( $database_name, $collection_name );
        $obj->_mongo_collection( $collection_name );

    Returns a MongoDB::Collection. With two arguments, the first argument is
    the database name and the second is the collection name. With a single
    argument, the argument is the collection name from the default database
    name.

  _mongo_clear_caches
        $obj->_mongo_clear_caches;

    Clears the MongoDB client, database and collection caches. The next
    request for a database or collection will reconnect to the MongoDB.

CONFIGURING
    The role uses several private attributes to configure itself:

    *   "_mongo_client_class" — name of the client class

    *   "_mongo_client_options" — passed to client constructor

    *   "_mongo_default_database" — default name used if not specified

    Each of these have lazy builders that you can override in your class to
    customize behavior of the role.

    The builders are:

    *   "_build__mongo_client_class" — default is "MongoDB::MongoClient"

    *   "_build__mongo_client_options" — default is an empty hash reference

    *   "_build__mongo_default_database" — default is the string 'test'

    You will generally want to at least override
    "_build__mongo_client_options" to allow connecting to different hosts.
    You may want to set it explicitly or you may want to have your own
    public attribute for users to set (as shown in the "SYNOPSIS"). The
    choice is up to you.

    If a MongoDB "host" string is provided in the client options hash, any
    host names will be converted to IP addresses to avoid known bugs using
    authentication over SSL.

    Note that the "_mongo_default_database" is also used as the default
    database for authentication, unless a "db_name" is provided to
    "_mongo_client_options".

LOGGING
    Currently, only 'debug' level logs messages are generated for tracing
    MongoDB interaction activity across forks. See the tests for an example
    of how to enable it.
