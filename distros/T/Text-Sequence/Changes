As 0.26, but I botched the upload of 0.26 to PAUSE.

Very minor internal tweak to make the test suite pass consistently
on recent Perls. This is RT#111173.

Lots of work on singletons by Adam Spiers. Some work
to generate regexen by Simon Wistow.

Initial release. This is based on some code by Simon Wistow
and then bashed into a more usuable and general form by 
Adam Spiers. 

It was largely done to attempt to find sequences of files so
it may still have the odd anachronism because of that.
