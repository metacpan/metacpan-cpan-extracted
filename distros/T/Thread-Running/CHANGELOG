	whether a thread is running.  Fixed by marking the thread as running
	in the parent thread, rather than in the thread itself.

0.06    29 March 2004
        Goto &sub considered evil with regards to performance and memory

	Now uses load.pm to reduce the number of subroutines loaded at compile
	time.  The status hash is now also available externally, which may or
