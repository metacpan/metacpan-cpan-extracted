=head1 NAME

KinoSearch::Search::PolySearcher - Aggregate results from multiple Searchers.

=head1 DEPRECATED

The KinoSearch code base has been assimilated by the Apache L<Lucy> project.
The "KinoSearch" namespace has been deprecated, but development continues
under our new name at our new home: L<http://lucy.apache.org/>

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $schema = MySchema->new;
    for my $server_name (@server_names) {
        push @searchers, KSx::Remote::SearchClient->new(
            peer_address => "$server_name:$port",
            password     => $pass,
            schema       => $schema,
        );
    }
    my $poly_searcher = KinoSearch::Search::PolySearcher->new(
        schema    => $schema,
        searchers => \@searchers,
    );
    my $hits = $poly_searcher->hits( query => $query );



=head1 DESCRIPTION

The primary use for PolySearcher is to aggregate results from several
remote L<Searchers|KinoSearch::Search::Searcher> via
L<KSx::Remote::SearchClient>, diffusing the cost of searching a large
corpus over multiple machines.  It is also possible to aggregate results
from multiple Searchers on a single machine.

=head1 CONSTRUCTORS

=head2 new( I<[labeled params]> )

    my $poly_searcher = KinoSearch::Search::PolySearcher->new(
        schema    => $schema,
        searchers => \@searchers,
    );

=over

=item *

B<schema> - A Schema.

=item *

B<searchers> - An array of Searchers.

=back





=head1 METHODS

=head2 hits( I<[labeled params]> )

Return a Hits object containing the top results.

=over

=item *

B<query> - Either a Query object or a query string.

=item *

B<offset> - The number of most-relevant hits to discard, typically
used when "paging" through hits N at a time.  Setting
C<< offset >> to 20 and C<< num_wanted >> to 10 retrieves
hits 21-30, assuming that 30 hits can be found.

=item *

B<num_wanted> - The number of hits you would like to see after
C<< offset >> is taken into account.

=item *

B<sort_spec> - A L<KinoSearch::Search::SortSpec>, which will affect
how results are ranked and returned.

=back

=head2 doc_max()

Return the maximum number of docs in the collection represented by the
Searcher, which is also the highest possible internal doc id.
Documents which have been marked as deleted but not yet purged are
included in this count.

=head2 doc_freq( I<[labeled params]> )

Return the number of documents which contain the term in the given
field.

=over

=item *

B<field> - Field name.

=item *

B<term> - The term to look up.

=back

=head2 fetch_doc(doc_id)

Retrieve a document.  Throws an error if the doc id is out of range.

=over

=item *

B<doc_id> - A document id.

=back

=head2 get_schema()

Accessor for the object's C<< schema >> member.
