=head1 alleles_to_bp_locs

This command can be used to find the contig and position corresponding to each
of a set of alleles.  The command takes in a table with a designated column containing
allele IDs.  It adds a column containing the location corresponding to the allele

Example:

    alleles_to_bp_locs [arguments] < input > output

The standard input should be a tab-separated table (i.e., each line
is a tab-separated set of fields).  Normally, the last field in each
line would contain the identifer. If another column contains the identifier
use

    -c N

where N is the column (from 1) that contains the identifier.

This is a pipe command. The input is taken from the standard input, and the
output is to the standard output.

=head2 Documentation for underlying call

This script is a wrapper for the CDMI-API call alleles_to_bp_locs. It is documented as follows:



=over 4

=item Parameter and return types

=begin html

<pre>
$alleles is an alleles
$return is a reference to a hash where the key is an allele and the value is a bp_loc
alleles is a reference to a list where each element is an allele
allele is a string
bp_loc is a reference to a list containing 2 items:
	0: a contig
	1: an int
contig is a string

This is used only if the column containing the identifier is not the last column.

=head2 Output Format

The standard output is a tab-delimited file. It consists of the input
file with extra columns added.

Input lines that cannot be extended are written to stderr.
