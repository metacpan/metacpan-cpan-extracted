If you want better support for older Perls, use Test::Reporter.
CPAN::Reporter is also required if you are using CPAN shell.
Also you can run cpan smoking. That way module can be fixed even before
you'll find that you need it. See CPAN::YACSmoke.


Generally, you should use Test::Reporter - it's the only way to measure popularity
of distribution. Why do anything with it, if it is not used.


Patches welcome. Please write tests for error you found.
