DESCRIPTION

    This module defines a simple format to let you store and read parts
    from data section. The distribution also comes with a reader (see
    Data::Section::Seekable::Reader) and a writer/generator (see
    Data::Section::Seekable::Writer).

    Like Data::Section, the format allows you to store multiple parts in
    data section. This module's format is different from Data::Section's
    and is meant to allow seeking to any random content part just by
    reading the index/"table of content" part of the data section.

FORMAT

    This document descries version 1 (v1) of the format.

    First line of data section is the header line and must be:

     Data::Section::Seekable v1

    Actually, the header line need not be the first line of data. Previous
    lines not matching the header line will be ignored (so you can put
    other stuffs here).

    After the header line, comes zero or more TOC ("table of content")
    lines. Each TOC line must match this Perl regex:

     /^([^,]+), (\d+), (\d+) (?:, (.*))?/x

    The first field is the name, the second field is the offset, the third
    field is the length. Offset starts from 0 and the zero is counted from
    after the blank line after the last TOC line. The fourth field is to
    store extra information, it is optional and can contain zero or more
    non-newline characters.

    After the last TOC line is a blank line. And after that is content.

    Example:

     Data::Section::Seekable v1
     part1,0,14
     part2,14,17,very,important
    
     This is part1
     This is part
     two
