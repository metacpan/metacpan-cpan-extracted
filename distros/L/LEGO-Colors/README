README for LEGO::Colors

			    LEGO::Colors

LEGO::Colors is a data module giving access to the RGB values of the various
available colors of LEGO pieces.

PREREQUISITES

This suite requires Perl 5; I've only used it under Perl 5.8.0, so for
anything lower, you're on your own.

LEGO::Colors doesn't use any nonstandard modules.  In fact, it doesn't use
any other modules at all.

INSTALLATION

You install LEGO::Colors, as you would install any perl module
library, by running these commands:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

If you want to install a private copy of LEGO::Colors in your home
directory, then you should try to produce the initial Makefile with
something like this command:

  perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=~/perl

DOCUMENTATION

POD-format documentation is included in Colors.pm and Color.pm.  POD is
readable with the 'perldoc' utility.
