DESCRIPTION

    This module tries to implement the creation of XML files conforming to
    the NewsML-G2 specification as published by the IPTC. It does not aim
    to implement the complete standard, but to cover the most common use
    cases in a best-practice manner.

    For the full specification of the format, visit
    http://www.newsml-g2.org/. For a quick introduction, you might prefer
    the Quick Start Guides
    <http://www.iptc.org/download?g2quickstartguides>.

GETTING STARTED

    To start, you need to create an instance of the item class of your
    choice, e.g. XML::NewsML_G2::News_Item_Text for a text story, or
    XML::NewsML_G2::News_Item_Picture for an image. Each of these classes
    might have some required attributes (e.g. title, language, provider),
    which you will have to provide when creating the instance, as well as a
    number of optional ones (e.g. note). While for some attributes scalar
    values will do, others will require further instances of classes, e.g.
    for provider you will need an instance of XML::NewsML_G2::Provider.
    Please see each class' documentation for details.

    Once you're done setting up your data structure, you have to create a
    writer instance in order to retrieve your DOM. For simple news items
    like text or picture, XML::NewsML_G2::Writer::News_Item will be the
    writer class to use.

CURRENT STATUS

    The implementation currently supports text, picture, video, audio,
    graphics, as well as multimedia packages and slideshows.

    Version 2.18 is the latest version of the standard supported by this
    software, and should be your first choice. Using versions 2.9, 2.12 and
    2.15 is deprecated, and support for it will beremoved in future
    releases.
