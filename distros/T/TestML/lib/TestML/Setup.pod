=head1 SYNOPSIS

    perl -MTestML::Setup -e setup t/testml.yaml

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A pure TestML suite contains no language specific code. Normally you need to
write a very small test program that points to a TestML document and runs it.

This module does that for you. By providing a small YAML file, this module
will generate all your testml runtime programs for you.
