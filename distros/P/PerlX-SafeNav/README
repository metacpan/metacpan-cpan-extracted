NAME

    PerlX::SafeNav - Safe-navigation for Perl

SYNOPSIS

    Wrap a chain of method calls to make it resilient on encountering undef
    values in the middle:

        use PerlX::SafeNav ('$safenav', '$unsafenav', 'safenav');
    
        my $answer = safenav {
            $_->a()->{b}->c()->[42]->d()
        } $o;
    
        my $tire_age = $car -> $safenav
             -> wheels()
             -> [0]               # undef, if no wheels at all.
             -> tire()            # undef, if no tire on the wheel.
             -> {created_on}
             -> delta_days($now)
             -> $unsafenav;
    
        unless (defined $tire_age) {
            # The car either have no wheels, or the first wheel has no tire.
            ...
        }

DESCRIPTION

 Background

    In many other languages, there is an operator (often ?.) doing "Safe
    navigation", or "Optional Chaining". The operator does a method-call
    when its left-hand side (first operant) is an object. But when the
    left-hand side is an undefined value (or null value), the operator
    returns but evaluates to undef.

    For perl there is currently an PPC: Optional Chaining
    <https://github.com/Perl/PPCs/blob/main/ppcs/ppc0021-optional-chaining-operator.md>

    This module provides a mean of making chains of method call safe
    regarding undef values. When encountering an undef in the middle of a
    call chain like $o->foo()->bar()->baz(), the program would die with a
    message like this:

        Can't call method "bar" on an undefined value

    With the help of this module, instead of making the program die, the
    call chain is reduced to undef.

 Usages

  $safenav and $unsafenav

    With this module, instead of using a different operator, we wrap a
    chain of calls to make it safe with the imported $safenav and
    $unsafenav. $safenav must be placed at the beginning, while $unsafenav
    must be place at the end. The should be invoked as method calls, like
    this:

        $obj-> $safenav
            -> a()
            -> {b}
            -> [0]
            -> c()
            -> $unsafenav;

    Notice that it is possible to mix all three kinds method calls, hash
    fetches, and array fetches together in the same chain. If any of the 4
    sub-expresions returns undef, the entire chain upto $unsafenav would
    also be evaluated to undef. (For this reason, you probably don't want
    to concatenate more sub-expressions after $unsafenav.)

    This module provide 2 symbols are both $-sigiled scalar variables, this
    is on purpose, so that they could be called as methods on arbitrary
    scalar values.

    It is mandatory to have both $safenav and $unsafenav together in the
    same chain. Without $unsafenav, the original return value of the chain
    would be forever wrapped inside the mechanism of PerlX::SafeNav.

    While being unconventional in their look, one benifit is that the
    chance of having naming conflicts with methods from $o should be very
    small. However, be aware that $safenav and $unsafenav would be masked
    by locally-defined variables with the same name.

  safenav block

    A block syntax is also provided by importing the safenav symbol
    explicitly:

        use PerlX::SafeNav ('safenav');
    
        my $answer = safenav {
            $_ ->a()->{b}->[0]->c()
        } $o;

    Inside this safenav block, $_ is the safenav-wrapped version of $o, and
    the chain is automaticly un-wrapped at the end. $answer contains the
    return value of method c() if no undef values are encountered or
    otherwise, an undef.

 Bugs

    There are likely many unknown bugs, as the current test suite only
    covers the minmum set of forms that are known to work.
