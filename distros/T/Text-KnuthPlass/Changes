  lib/Text/KnuthPlass.xs, lib/Text/KnuthPlass.pm, t/01-nodes.t
   Fix mishandling of line length array in XS code (was only looking at first 
    two elements). Remove elements as used, and return to application.

  examples/text/KP.pl (new), examples/text/Flatland.pl (new), 
    examples/text/Triangle.pl (new), MANIFEST, tools/3_examples.pl
   Add more examples, this time for text file (.txt) output (constant width).

  examples/PDF/Flatland.pl (new), examples/PDF/Triangle.pl (new),
    examples/PDF/KP.pl, MANIFEST, tools/3_examples.pl
   Add more examples of PDF document creation, and update KP example.

  lib/Text/KnuthPlass.pm, lib/Text/KnuthPlass.xs, examples/*, t/01-nodes.t
   Pass paragraph indentation (or negative outdent amount) to KP algorithm, so
    can start even the first line of paragraph at same x value every time. 
    Allow per-paragraph setting of indentation via typeset() method and the new
    line_lengths() method. For compatibility with older applications, the
    default indentation is 0.

  lib/Text/KnuthPlass.pm, README.md
   Add flag to ignore XS code (whether or not successfully installed) and just 
    run pure Perl. This is good for debugging, watching paint dry, or torturing
    your users! In other words, pure Perl is quite slow.

  lib/Text/KnuthPlass.pm 
   Add flag for minimum 3 letter suffix in hyphenation (not sure Text::Hyphen
    is obeying it).

  META.json, MANIFEST add META.json

  examples/PDF/KP.pl sample put all three texts on one page

  LICENSE, MANIFEST  add separate LICENSE file

  META.yml  add minimum Perl version (5.8.1)

  examples/PDF/KP.pl, examples/resources/, tools/3_examples.pl, MANIFEST,
    README.md
   Move PDF examples to own subdirectory, leaving room in examples/ for
    other language examples (such as plain text). Common resources directory.

  tools/*.pl, lib/Text/KnuthPlass.pm
   Change "my $LAST_UPDATE" to "our $LAST_UPDATE" so info available to a
    program.

  README.md, lib/Text/KnuthPlass.pm
   2022 copyright

  lib/Text/KnuthPlass.xs 
   Fix compiler warnings (#8).

  In examples, change lead() to leading() per PDF::API2 and PDF::Builder.

  Update build process to ensure that all human-readable files are "unix"
   format and not MS-DOS (CRLF) format on line-ends. Some non-CPAN packagers
   are complaining about the mixed line-end formats.

2021-02-12  1.06  (Phil M Perry)

  lib/Text/KnuthPlass.pm, lib/Text/KnuthPlass.xs
   Minor fix to properly index line length list on longer paragraphs.

  Build.PL
   Add resources for repository and bugtracker (point to GitHub).

  tools/pod2cpanhtml.pl, INFO/kp.html, MANIFEST, .github/workflows/test.yml
   Let's see if Continuous Integration is any happier with this HTML produced
    by a more up-to-date tool. No, but try excluding kp.html from lint.

  README.md, INFO/kp.html, lib/Text/KnuthPlass.pm, MANIFEST
   2021 copyright. NOT archiving Changes, yet. kp.html moved to INFO/.

  MANIFEST, kp.html, RoadMap, .gitignore, lib/Text/KnuthPlass.pm
   Ship documentation (POD) kp.html (also on GitHub). 
    Roadmap/discussions/thoughts (RoadMap) in public on GitHub (Read-Only).

2020-12-29  1.05  (Phil M Perry)

  examples/KP.pl
   Fix superfluous hyphen when splitting at an existing hyphen. It is not clear
    whether this is the best practice, or that it would be better to handle
    this "upstream" in KnuthPlass.pm. Also, other hyphens and dashes do not
    seem to be well handled.

  META.yml, README.md
   Clean up support-related email addresses and pages.

  README.md  remove example code (is still found in examples/KP.pl) to 
    shorten this file to a reasonable length.

  META.yml
   Add repository (GitHub) and bugtracker (GitHub) entries. Want to cut over
    to GitHub because RT ticket system is going away in March.

  t/02-javascript.t
   Got another floating point failure (long double or quadmath), so went 
    ahead and rounded the rest of the floating point constants in that test.

2020-12-10  1.04  (Phil M Perry)

  Makefile.PL removed, Build.PL, META.yml, MANIFEST, README.md
   Revert to use of Build.PL.

2020-12-09  1.03  (Phil M Perry)

  Makefile.PL, Build.PL, MANIFEST
   Change build process to use Makefile.PL instead of Build.PL

  t/02-javascript.t
   Fix failing t-tests due to use of long-double or quadmath libraries (more
    precision than the t-test was providing). There are still many failures
    of this test on every Solaris box, but at the moment I have no way to
    try to debug on that platform (I will be looking for volunteers to help
    out with this).

  lib/Text/KnuthPlass.xs
   Fix failing Windows t-tests where libraries already contained an _unlink
    module (rename to _unlinkKP).

  Build.PL, README.md, MANIFEST
   Change authorship statement, write a much more complete README 
    (with markdown).

  t/00-load.t, t/02-javascript.t, t/pod-coverage.t, t/pod.t, 
    lib/Text/KnuthPlass.pm
   Fix Perl Critic complaints. Currently ignoring "multiple package 
    declarations" in KnuthPlass.pm, might in the future split up the file.
    Move pod and pod-coverage to "author testing only".

  tools/1_pc.pl, tools/2_t-tests.pl, tools/3_examples.pl, MANIFEST,
    examples/KP.pl
   Add some tools for testing and illustrating usage.
