Asset::Pack

This module allows you to construct Perl modules containing the content
of arbitrary files, which may then be installed or fat-packed.

In most cases, this module is not what you want, and you should use a
"File::ShareDir" based system instead, but "File::ShareDir" based
systems are inherently not fat-pack friendly.

However, if you need embedded, single-file applications, aggregating not
only Perl Modules, but templates, JavaScript and CSS, this tool will
make some of your work easier.

If anything fails it throws an exception. This is meant for scripts that
will be tended by a human (or analyzed if it fails as part of a build).

INSTALLATION

This is a Perl module distribution. It should be installed with whichever
tool you use to manage your installation of Perl, e.g. any of

  cpanm .
  cpan  .
  cpanp -i .

Consult http://www.cpan.org/modules/INSTALL.html for further instruction.
Should you wish to install this module manually, the procedure is

  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test
  make install
