=head1 NAME

lcpan - Manage your local CPAN mirror

=head1 VERSION

This document describes version 1.034 of lcpan (from Perl distribution App-lcpan), released on 2019-06-19.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

=head2 Creating/updating your local CPAN mirror

The first step to use C<lcpan> is to create/update your local CPAN mirror. You
can install the bootstrap database first to avoid doing indexing from scratch:

 % cpanm -n App::lcpan::Bootstrap

Then run:

 % lcpan update --trace

A mini CPAN mirror will be downloaded/updated in your C<~/cpan> directory. This
will take a while, e.g. a couple of hours, depending on your Internet connection
speed (as of 2019-05-20 the size of a mini CPAN mirror is ~7GB). Subsequent
updates will of course take significantly shorter time.

After download, a SQLite database will also be created/updated at
C<~/cpan/index.db> which will contain information about authors,
modules/packages, distributions. This database will be used to answer queries
you might issue later. During this "indexing" process, release files will be
extracted to temporary directory and the source codes will be scanned. This
process will again take a while for the first time, e.g. under an hour (if you
are using a fairly recent bootstrap database) or a few hours (if you are
indexing from scratch). Subsequent updates will be much faster.

You can run the above "update" command e.g. daily to keep your mirror
up-to-date. Omit the C<--trace> option to see less debugging messages.

=head2 Using your local CPAN mirror to install modules

 % lcpanm -n Some::Module

C<lcpanm> is a thin wrapper for C<cpanm>. The above command is equivalent to:

 % cpanm --mirror ~/cpan --mirror-only -n Some::Module

=head2 Injecting additional modules to your local CPAN mirror

Sometimes, you only want to add one or a few modules to the local CPAN mirror.
For example, you are on a bad/expensive Internet connection and cannot afford a
full mirror update. Or, you have a module that is not indexed on CPAN but want
to add to your local mirror (creating a so-called DarkPAN based on an existing
mini CPAN mirror). To do that:

 % lcpan inject --author SOMEONE Foo-0.01.tar.gz Bar-Baz-2.34.tar.gz

where C<SOMEONE> is an author ID (does not need to already exist) that you
choose to put the modules under.

This will add the files to the local mirror as well as update the index.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This application is a convenient bundling of C<CPAN::Mini> and an indexer so in
addition to creating your local CPAN mirror and installing modules from it, you
can also query various things about your local CPAN mirror quickly from the
command-line (as well as programmatically). Powerful and more convenient
querying is the main reason C<lcpan> is created.

=head1 MORE EXAMPLE QUERIES AND COMMANDS FOR CPAN USERS

=head2 Show how many dists will need to be installed if I install this module

TODO

=head2 Install all modules from a certain CPAN author

 % lcpan author-mods PERLANCAR | cpanm -n

or (if you want to install from local CPAN mirror):

 % lcpan author-mods PERLANCAR | lcpanm -n

or (specify release files directly):

 % lcpan author-rels --latest PERLANCAR | cpanm -n

=head2 Update all modules on your system, from local CPAN mirror

 % cpan-outdated --mirror file:$HOME/cpan | lcpanm -n

=head1 MORE EXAMPLE QUERIES AND COMMANDS FOR CPAN AUTHORS

=head2 Count your CPAN modules, dists, and releases

 % lcpan author-mods  PERLANCAR | wc -l
 % lcpan author-dists PERLANCAR | wc -l
 % lcpan author-rels  PERLANCAR | wc -l

=head2 More complex queries

For more complex queries, you can always access the SQLite database directly.
See L<App::lcpan> for the database schema.

=head1 SUBCOMMANDS

=head2 B<author-deps>

List dependencies for all of the dists of an author.

=head2 B<author-deps-by-dependent-count>

List all dependencies of dists of an author, sorted by number of dependent dists.

=head2 B<author-dists>

List distributions of an author.

=head2 B<author-mods>

List modules of an author.

=head2 B<author-rdeps>

Find distributions that use one of author's modules.

=head2 B<author-rels>

List releases of an author.

=head2 B<author-scripts>

List scripts of an author.

=head2 B<authors>

List authors.

=head2 B<authors-by-dist-count>

List authors ranked by number of dists.

=head2 B<authors-by-filesize>

List authors ranked by total size of their indexed releases.

=head2 B<authors-by-mod-count>

List authors ranked by number of modules.

=head2 B<authors-by-mod-mention-count>

List authors ranked by number of module mentions.

This shows the list of most mentioned authors, that is, authors whose modules
are linked/referred to the most in PODs.

By default, each source module/script that mentions a module from author is
counted as one mention (C<--count-per content>). Use C<--count-per dist> to only
count mentions by modules/scripts from the same dist as one mention (so an
author only gets a maximum of 1 vote per dist). Use C<--count-per author> to only
count mentions by modules/scripts from the same author as one mention (so an
author only gets a maximum of 1 vote per mentioning author).

By default, only mentions from other authors are included. Use
C<--include-self-mentions> to also include mentions from the same author.


=head2 B<authors-by-rdep-count>

List authors ranked by number of distributions using one of his/her modules.

=head2 B<authors-by-rel-count>

List authors ranked by number of releases.

=head2 B<authors-by-script-count>

List authors ranked by number of scripts.

=head2 B<changes>

Show Changes of distribution/module.

This command will find a file named Changes/CHANGES/ChangeLog or other similar
name in the top-level directory inside the release tarballs and show it.


=head2 B<contents>

List contents inside releases.

This subcommand lists files inside release archives.


=head2 B<copy-mod>

Copy a module's latest release file to current directory.

=head2 B<copy-rel>

Copy a release file to current directory.

=head2 B<copy-script>

Copy a script's latest release file to current directory.

=head2 B<delete-rel>

Delete a release record in the database.

Will delete records associated with a release in the database (including in the
C<file> table, C<module>, C<dist>, C<dep>, and so on). If C<--delete-file> option is
specified, will also remove the file from the local mirror.

But currently will not remove/update the C<modules/02packages.details.txt.gz>
index.


=head2 B<deps>

List dependencies.

By default only runtime requires are displayed. To see prereqs for other phases
(e.g. configure, or build, or ALL) or for other relationships (e.g. recommends,
or ALL), use the C<--phase> and C<--rel> options.

Note that dependencies information are taken from C<META.json> or C<META.yml>
files. Not all releases (especially older ones) contain them. L<lcpan> (like
MetaCPAN) does not extract information from C<Makefile.PL> or C<Build.PL> because
that requires running (untrusted) code.

Also, some releases specify dynamic config, so there might actually be more
dependencies.


=head2 B<deps-by-dependent-count>

List dependencies, sorted by number of dependents.

This subcommand is like C<deps>, except that this subcommand does not support
recursing and it sorts the result by number of dependent dists. For example,
Suppose that dist C<Foo> depends on C<Mod1> and C<Mod2>, C<Bar> depends on C<Mod2>
and C<Mod3>, and C<Baz> depends on C<Mod2> and C<Mod3>, then C<lcpan
deps-by-dependent-count Foo Bar Baz> will return C<Mod2> (3 dependents), C<Mod3>
(2 dependents), C<Mod1> (1 dependent).


=head2 B<dist-contents>

List contents inside a distribution.

This subcommand lists files inside a distribution.

 % lcpan dist-contents Foo-Bar

is basically equivalent to:

 % lcpan contents --dist Foo-Bar


=head2 B<dist-meta>

Get distribution metadata.

=head2 B<dist-mods>

List modules in a distribution.

=head2 B<dist-scripts>

List scripts in a distribution.

=head2 B<dist2author>

Get author of distribution(s).

=head2 B<dist2rel>

Get (latest) release name of a distribution.

=head2 B<dists>

List distributions.

=head2 B<dists-by-dep-count>

List "heavy" distributions (ranked by number of dependencies).

=head2 B<doc>

Show POD documentation of module/.pod/script.

This command extracts module (.pm)/.pod/script from release tarballs and render
its POD documentation. Since the documentation is retrieved from the release
tarballs in the mirror, the module/.pod/script needs not be installed.

Note that currently this command has trouble finding documentation for core
modules because those are contained in perl release tarballs instead of release
tarballs of modules, and C<lcpan> is currently not designed to work with those.


=head2 B<extract-dist>

Extract a distribution's latest release file to current directory.

=head2 B<extract-mod>

Extract a module's latest release file to current directory.

=head2 B<extract-rel>

Extract a release to current directory.

=head2 B<extract-script>

Extract a script's latest release file to current directory.

=head2 B<inject>

Inject one or more tarballs to the mirror.

=head2 B<mentions>

List mentions.

This subcommand lists mentions (references to modules/scripts in POD files
inside releases).

Only mentions to modules/scripts in another release are indexed (i.e. mentions
to modules/scripts in the same dist/release are not indexed). Only mentions to
known scripts are indexed, but mentions to unknown modules are also indexed.


=head2 B<mentions-by-mod>

List POD mentions by module(s).

This subcommand is a shortcut for:

 % lcpan mentions --mentioner-module MOD


=head2 B<mentions-by-script>

List POD mentions by script(s).

This subcommand is a shortcut for:

 % lcpan mentions --mentioner-script SCRIPT


=head2 B<mentions-for-all-mods>

List PODs which mention all specified module(s).

=head2 B<mentions-for-mod>

List POD mentions for module(s).

This subcommand is a shortcut for:

 % lcpan mentions --type known-module --mentioned-module MOD


=head2 B<mentions-for-script>

List POD mentions for script(s).

This subcommand is a shortcut for:

 % lcpan mentions --type script --mentioned-script SCRIPT


=head2 B<mod-contents>

List contents inside a module's distribution.

This subcommand lists files inside a module's distribution.

 % lcpan mod-contents Foo::Bar

is basically equivalent to:

 % lcpan contents --dist C<lcpan mod2dist Foo::Bar>


=head2 B<mod2author>

Get author of module(s).

=head2 B<mod2dist>

Get distribution name of module(s).

=head2 B<mod2rel>

Get (latest) release name of a module.

=head2 B<mods>

Alias for 'modules'.

=head2 B<mods-by-mention-count>

List modules ranked by number of mentions.

This shows the list of most mentioned modules, that is, modules who are
linked/referred to the most in PODs.

Unknown modules (modules not indexed) are not included. Note that mentions can
refer to unknown modules.

By default, each source module/script that mentions a module is counted as one
mention (C<--count-per content>). Use C<--count-per dist> to only count mentions
by modules/scripts from the same dist as one mention (so a module only gets a
maximum of 1 vote per dist). Use C<--count-per author> to only count mentions by
modules/scripts from the same author as one mention (so a module only gets a
maximum of 1 vote per mentioning author).

By default, only mentions from other authors are included. Use
C<--include-self-mentions> to also include mentions from the same author.


=head2 B<mods-by-rdep-count>

List modules ranked by number of reverse dependencies.

=head2 B<mods-from-same-dist>

Given a module, list all modules in the same distribution.

=head2 B<modules>

List modules/packages.

=head2 B<namespaces>

List namespaces.

=head2 B<rdeps>

List reverse dependencies.

=head2 B<related-mods>

List other modules related to module(s).

This subcommand lists other modules that might be related to the module(s) you
specify. This is done by listing modules that tend be mentioned together in POD
documentation.

The scoring/ranking still needs to be tuned.


=head2 B<releases>

List releases/tarballs.

The status field is the processing status of the file/release by lcpan. C<ok>
means file has been extracted and the meta files parsed, C<nofile> means file is
not found in mirror (possibly because the mirroring process excludes the file
e.g. due to file size too large), C<nometa> means file does not contain
META.{yml,json}, C<unsupported> means file archive format is not supported (e.g.
rar), C<err> means some other error in processing file.


=head2 B<rels>

Alias for 'releases'.

The status field is the processing status of the file/release by lcpan. C<ok>
means file has been extracted and the meta files parsed, C<nofile> means file is
not found in mirror (possibly because the mirroring process excludes the file
e.g. due to file size too large), C<nometa> means file does not contain
META.{yml,json}, C<unsupported> means file archive format is not supported (e.g.
rar), C<err> means some other error in processing file.


=head2 B<reset>

Reset (empty) the database index.

=head2 B<script2author>

Get author name of script(s).

=head2 B<script2dist>

Get distribution(s) of script(s).

=head2 B<script2mod>

Get module(s) of script(s).

This returns a module name from the same dist as the script, so one can do
something like this (install dist which contains a specified script from CPAN):

 % cpanm -n C<lcpan script2mod pmdir>


=head2 B<script2rel>

Get release(s) of script(s).

=head2 B<scripts>

List scripts.

This subcommand lists scripts. Scripts are identified heuristically from
contents of release archives matching this regex:

 #         container dir,  script dir,       script name
 \A (\./)? ([^/]+)/?       (s?bin|scripts?)/ ([^/]+) \z

A few exception are excluded, e.g. if script name begins with a dot (e.g.
C<bin/.exists> which is usually a marker only).

Scripts are currently indexed by its release file and its name, so if a single
release contains both C<bin/foo> and C<script/foo>, only one of those will be
indexed. Normally a proper release shouldn't be like that though.


=head2 B<scripts-by-mention-count>

List scripts ranked by number of mentions.

This shows the list of most mentioned scripts, that is, scripts who are
linked/referred to the most in PODs.

By default, each source module/script that mentions a script is counted as one
mention (C<--count-per content>). Use C<--count-per dist> to only count mentions
by modules/scripts from the same dist as one mention (so a script only gets a
maximum of 1 vote per dist). Use C<--count-per author> to only count mentions by
modules/scripts from the same author as one mention (so a script only gets a
maximum of 1 vote per mentioning author).

By default, only mentions from other authors are included. Use
C<--include-self-mentions> to also include mentions from the same author.


=head2 B<scripts-from-same-dist>

Given a script, list all scripts in the same distribution.

=head2 B<src>

Show source of module/.pod/script.

This command is a shortcut for:

 % lcpan doc --raw MODULE_OR_POD_OR_SCRIPT


=head2 B<stats>

Statistics of your local CPAN mirror.

=head2 B<stats-last-index-time>

Return last index time of mirror.

This is mostly to support L<App::lcpan::Call>. See also C<stats> subcommand
which gives a more complete statistics, but can be much slower.


=head2 B<subnames-by-count>

List subroutine names ranked by number of occurrences.




=head2 B<subs>

List subroutines.

This subcommand lists subroutines/methods/static methods.


=head2 B<update>

Create/update local CPAN mirror.

This subcommand first create/update the mirror files by downloading from a
remote CPAN mirror, then update the index.

=head1 OPTIONS

C<*> marks required options.

=head2 Common options

=over

=item B<--config-path>=I<filename>, B<-c>

Set path to configuration file.

=item B<--config-profile>=I<s>, B<-P>

Set configuration profile to use.

=item B<--cpan>=I<s>

Location of your local CPAN mirror, e.g. /path/to/cpan.

Defaults to C<~/cpan>.


=item B<--debug>

Shortcut for --log-level=debug.

=item B<--format>=I<s>

Choose output format, e.g. json, text.

Default value:

 undef

=item B<--help>, B<-h>, B<-?>

Display help message and exit.

=item B<--index-name>=I<s>

Filename of index.

Default value:

 "index.db"

If `index_name` is a filename without any path, e.g. `index.db` then index will
be located in the top-level of `cpan`. If `index_name` contains a path, e.g.
`./index.db` or `/home/ujang/lcpan.db` then the index will be located solely
using the `index_name`.


=item B<--json>

Set output format to json.

=item B<--log-level>=I<s>

Set log level.

=item B<--no-config>, B<-C>

Do not use any configuration file.

=item B<--no-env>

Do not read environment for default options.

=item B<--no-naked-res>

When outputing as JSON, add result envelope.

By default, when outputing as JSON, the full enveloped result is returned, e.g.:

    [200,"OK",[1,2,3],{"func.extra"=>4}]

The reason is so you can get the status (1st element), status message (2nd
element) as well as result metadata/extra result (4th element) instead of just
the result (3rd element). However, sometimes you want just the result, e.g. when
you want to pipe the result for more post-processing. In this case you can use
`--naked-res` so you just get:

    [1,2,3]


=item B<--no-use-bootstrap>

If you are indexing your private CPAN-like repository, you want to turn this
off.


=item B<--quiet>

Shortcut for --log-level=error.

=item B<--self-upgrade>, B<-U>

Update program to latest version from CPAN.

=item B<--subcommands>

List available subcommands.

=item B<--trace>

Shortcut for --log-level=trace.

=item B<--verbose>

Shortcut for --log-level=info.

=item B<--version>, B<-v>

=item B<--author>=I<s>*

=item B<--exclude-core>

Exclude core modules.

=item B<--exclude-noncore>

Exclude non-core modules.

=item B<--flatten>

Instead of showing tree-like information, flatten it.

When recursing, the default is to show the final result in a tree-like table,
i.e. indented according to levels, e.g.:

    % lcpan deps -R MyModule
    | module            | author  | version |
    |-------------------|---------|---------|
    | Foo               | AUTHOR1 | 0.01    |
    |   Bar             | AUTHOR2 | 0.23    |
    |   Baz             | AUTHOR3 | 1.15    |
    | Qux               | AUTHOR2 | 0       |

To be brief, if `Qux` happens to also depends on `Bar`, it will not be shown in
the result. Thus we don't know the actual `Bar` version that is needed by the
dependency tree of `MyModule`. For example, if `Qux` happens to depends on `Bar`
version 0.45 then `MyModule` indirectly requires `Bar` 0.45.

To list all the direct and indirect dependencies on a single flat list, with
versions already resolved to the largest version required, use the `flatten`
option:

    % lcpan deps -R --flatten MyModule
    | module            | author  | version |
    |-------------------|---------|---------|
    | Foo               | AUTHOR1 | 0.01    |
    | Bar               | AUTHOR2 | 0.45    |
    | Baz               | AUTHOR3 | 1.15    |
    | Qux               | AUTHOR2 | 0       |

Note that `Bar`'s required version is already 0.45 in the above example.

=head1 COMPLETION

This script has shell tab completion capability with support for several
shells.

=head2 bash

To activate bash completion for this script, put:

 complete -C lcpan lcpan

in your bash startup (e.g. F<~/.bashrc>). Your next shell session will then
recognize tab completion for the command. Or, you can also directly execute the
line above in your shell to activate immediately.

It is recommended, however, that you install modules using L<cpanm-shcompgen>
which can activate shell completion for scripts immediately.

=head2 tcsh

To activate tcsh completion for this script, put:

 complete lcpan 'p/*/`lcpan`/'

in your tcsh startup (e.g. F<~/.tcshrc>). Your next shell session will then
recognize tab completion for the command. Or, you can also directly execute the
line above in your shell to activate immediately.

It is also recommended to install L<shcompgen> (see above).

=head2 other shells

For fish and zsh, install L<shcompgen> as described above.

=head1 FAQ

=head2 How to customize location of local CPAN mirror?

By default CPAN mirror is put in C<~/cpan>. To customize this, use the C<--cpan>
option, e.g.:

 % lcpan update --cpan /path/to/my/cpan

You can also create a configuration C<~/lcpan.conf> so you don't have to specify
the C<--cpan> option everytime:

 cpan=/path/to/my/cpan

=head2 Where is the SQLite database (the index) located?

By default at C<$cpan/index.db>. You can customize the name of the database
using the C<--index-name> command-line option or the Cindex_name> configuration,
e.g.:

 --index-name lcpan.db

which will create the database at C<$cpan/lcpan.db>. If you want to put the
database file somewhere else (e.g. outside the CPAN repository structure),
prepend a path (something that contains "/") to the index name, e.g. in
configuration:

 index_name = /home/ujang/lcpan.db

=head2 How do I see the SQL statements/queries being issued while running lcpan?

You can try using L<Log::ger::DBI::Query>, e.g.:

 % PERL5OPT=-MLog::ger::DBI::Query TRACE=1 lcpan ...

=head2 How do I reindex from scratch (without downloading the mirror)?

Run C<lcpan reset> (or delete C<index.db>) and run C<lcpan update
--noupdate-files> again.

=head2 Indexing error: Out of memory!

This could happen when there is a corrupt archive or an archive that is too big.
To see which file is the culprit, try running C<lcpan update --noupdate-files>
with C<--verbose> (or even C<--debug> or C<--trace>). Then, you can skip the
file by using C<-F> or adding this entry to your C<lcpan.conf>:

 [update]
 skip_index_files=The-Culprit-1.23.tar.gz

Add more of such lines if you want to skip more files.

=head2 How do I download the mirror without updating the indexing?

Run C<lcpan update --noupdate-index>.

=head2 How do I see how recent the mirror or the index is?

Use C<lcpan stats> or C<lcpan stats-last-index-time>.

=head2 Can I use lcpan with a DarkPAN?

Yes. You can use C<lcpan> to index any CPAN-like repository. This include a mini
CPAN mirror, a mini CPAN mirror with a few injected private modules, or a
repository created by L<OrePAN> (or similar tools).

=head1 CONFIGURATION FILE

This script can read configuration files. Configuration files are in the format of L<IOD>, which is basically INI with some extra features.

By default, these names are searched for configuration filenames (can be changed using C<--config-path>): F<~/.config/lcpan.conf>, F<~/lcpan.conf>, or F</etc/lcpan.conf>.

All found files will be read and merged.

To disable searching for configuration files, pass C<--no-config>.

To put configuration for a certain subcommand only, use a section name like C<[subcommand=NAME]> or C<[SOMESECTION subcommand=NAME]>.

You can put multiple profiles in a single file by using section names like C<[profile=SOMENAME]> or C<[SOMESECTION profile=SOMENAME]> or C<[subcommand=SUBCOMMAND_NAME profile=SOMENAME]> or C<[SOMESECTION subcommand=SUBCOMMAND_NAME profile=SOMENAME]>. Those sections will only be read if you specify the matching C<--config-profile SOMENAME>.

You can also put configuration for multiple programs inside a single file, and use filter C<program=NAME> in section names, e.g. C<[program=NAME ...]> or C<[SOMESECTION program=NAME]>. The section will then only be used when the reading program matches.

Finally, you can filter a section by environment variable using the filter C<env=CONDITION> in section names. For example if you only want a section to be read if a certain environment variable is true: C<[env=SOMEVAR ...]> or C<[SOMESECTION env=SOMEVAR ...]>. If you only want a section to be read when the value of an environment variable has value equals something: C<[env=HOSTNAME=blink ...]> or C<[SOMESECTION env=HOSTNAME=blink ...]>. If you only want a section to be read when the value of an environment variable does not equal something: C<[env=HOSTNAME!=blink ...]> or C<[SOMESECTION env=HOSTNAME!=blink ...]>. If you only want a section to be read when an environment variable contains something: C<[env=HOSTNAME*=server ...]> or C<[SOMESECTION env=HOSTNAME*=server ...]>. Note that currently due to simplistic parsing, there must not be any whitespace in the value being compared because it marks the beginning of a new section filter or section name.
