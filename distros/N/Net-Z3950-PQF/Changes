Revision history for Perl extension Net::Z3950::PQF.

0.04  Fri Oct  5 13:13:20 BST 2007
	- Add new toSimpleServer() method to Net::Z3950::PQF::Node,
	  returning the compiled query as a nested set of structures
	  identical to those produced by the SimpleServer module and
	  passed as the {RPN} argument into the search handler.
	- Add new test-suite script, t/3-simpleserver.t, to test the
	  translation of compiled queries into SimpleServer format.

0.03  Wed Apr 27 11:51:28 BST 2005
	- Net::Z3950::PQF::TermNode and Net::Z3950::PQF::BooleanNode
	  are now subclasses of Net::Z3950::PQF::BooleanNode as
	  documented.  Test script "t/1-node.t" now tests subclass
	  relationships.
	- Support for Rset nodes.  Test script "t/1-node.t" now tests
	  Rset nodes.
	- Support for parsing @set.  Test script "t/2-parser.t" now
	  tests @set queries.
	- Handle multi-word terms enclosed in {curly brackets}.  Test
	  script "t/2-parser.t" tests this.
	- Representation of Term nodes has changed due to new private
	  base-class shared with Rset nodes.  NOTE THAT THIS IS A
	  BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE.  Code that used to
	  inspect $termNode->{term} should now use $termNode->{value}

0.02  Fri Dec 17 17:17:47 GMT 2004
	- Write the code!  First functional version.

0.01  Fri Dec 17 10:41:04 2004
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.22 with options
		-b 5.6.0 -X Net::Z3950::PQF


### Still to do:
	- Correct handling of double-quoted terms, so that backslash
	  can protect embedded double quotes.
	- Support for creating and rendering ProxNode.
	- Support for parsing @prox.
	- Support for parsing @term.
