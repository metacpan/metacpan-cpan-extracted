=head1 DESCRIPTION

In this section, a "keyboard" has a certain "character repertoir" (which characters may be
entered using this keyboard), and a mapping associating a character in the repertoir
to a keypress or to several (sequential or simultaneous) keypresses.  A small enough keyboard
may have a pretty arbitrary mapping and remain useful (witness QUERTY
vs Dvorak vs Colemac).  However, if a keyboard has a sufficiently large repertoir,
there must be a strong logic ("orthogonality") in this association - otherwise
the most part of the repertoir will not be useful (except for people who have an
extraordinary memory - and are ready to invest part of it into the keyboard).

"Character repertoir" needs of different people vary enormously; observing
the people around me, I get a very narrow point of view.  But it is the best
I can do; what I observe is that many of them would use 1000-2000 characters
if they had a simple way to enter them; and the needs of different people do 
not match a lot.  So to be helpful to different people, a keyboard should have 
at least 2000-3000 different characters in the repertoir.  (Some ballpark
comparisons: L<MES-3B|http://web.archive.org/web/20000815100817/http://www.egt.ie/standards/iso10646/pdf/cwa13873.pdf> 
has about 2800 characters; L<Adobe Glyph list|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Glyph_List> corresponds 
to about 3600 Unicode characters.)

To access these characters, how much structure one needs to carry in memory?  One can
make a (trivial) estimate from below: on Windows, the standard US keyboard allows 
entering 100 - or 104 - characters (94 ASCII keys, SPACE, ENTER, TAB - moreover, C-ENTER, 
BACKSPACE and C-BACKSPACE also produce characters; so do C-[, C-] and C-\
C-Break in most layouts!).  If one needs about 30 times more, one could do
with 5 different ways to "mogrify" a character; if these mogrifications 
are "orthogonal", then there are 2^5 = 32 ways of combining them, and
one could access 32*104 = 3328 characters.

Of course, the characters in a "reasonable repertoir" form a very amorphous
mass; there is no way to introduce a structure like that which is "natural"
(so there is a hope for "ordinary people" to keep it in memory).  So the
complexity of these mogrification is not in their number, but in their
"nature".  One may try to decrease this complexity by having very easy to
understand mogrifications - but then there is no hope in having 5 of them
- or 10, or 15, or 20.

However, we B<know> that many people I<are> able to memorise the layout of 
70 symbols on a keyboard.  So would they be able to handle, for example, 30 
different "natural" mogrifications?  And how large a repertoir of characters
one would be able to access using these mogrifications?

This module does not answer these questions directly, but it provides tools
for investigating them, and tools to construct the actually working keyboard
layouts based on these ideas.  It consists of the following principal
components:

=over 4

=item Unicode table examiner

distills relations between different Unicode characters from the Unicode tables,
and combines the results with user-specified "manual mogrification" rules.
From these automatic/manual mogrifications, it constructs orthogonal scaffolding 
supporting Unicode characters (we call it I<composition/decomposition>, but it
is a major generalization of the corresponding Unicode consortium's terms).

=item Layout constructor

allows building keyboard layouts based on the above mogrification rules, and
on other visual and/or logical directives.  It combines the bulk-handling
ability of automatic rule-based approach with a flexibility provided by 
a system of manual overrides.   (The rules are read from a F<.kbdd> L<I<Keyboard
Description> file|/"Keyboard description files">.

=item System-specific software layouts

may be created basing on the "theoretical layout" made by the layout
constructor — currently only on Windows (only via F<KBDUTOOL> route) and OS X.

=item Report/Debugging framework

creates human-readable descriptions of the layout, and/or debugging reports on
how the layout creation logic proceeded.

=back

The last (and, probably, the most important) component of the distribution is
L<an example keyboard layout|http://k.ilyaz.org/iz> created using this toolset.

=head1 Keyboard description files

=head2 Syntax

I could not find an appropriate existing configuration file format, so was
farced to invent yet-another-config-file-format.  Sorry...

Config file is for initialization of a tree implementing a hash of hashes of
hashes etc whole leaves are either strings or arrays of strings, and keys are
words.  The file consists of I<"sections">; each section fills a certain hash
in the tree.

Sections are separated by "section names" which are sequences of word
character and C</> (possibly empty) enclosed in square brackets.
C<[]> is a root hash, then C<[word]> is a hash reference by key C<word> in the
root hash, then C<[word/another]> is a hash referenced by element of the hash
referenced by C<[word]> etc.  Additionally, a section separator may look like
C<< [visual -> wordsAndSlashes] >>.

Sections are of two type: normal and visual.  A normal section
consists of comments (starting with C<#>) and assignments.  An assignment is
in one of 4 forms:

   word=value
   +word=value
   @word=value,value,value,value
   /word=value/value/value/value

The first assigns a string C<value> to the key C<word> in the hash of the
current section.  The second adds a value to an array referenced by the key
C<word>; the other two add several values.  Trailing whitespace is stripped.

Any string value without end-of-line characters and trailing whitespace
can be added this way (and values without commas or without slash can
be added in bulk to arrays).  In particular, there may be no whitespace before
C<=> sign, and the whitespace after C<=> is a part of the value.

Visual sections consist of comments, assignments, and C<content>, which
is I<the rest> of the section.  Comments
after the last assignment become parts of the content.  The content is
preserved as a whole, and assigned to the key C<unparsed_data>; trailing
whitespace is stripped.  (This is the way to insert a value containing
end-of-line-characters.)

In the context of this distribution, the intent of visual sections is to be
parsed by a postprocessor.  So the only purpose of explicit assignments in a
visual section is to configure how I<the rest> is parsed; after the parsing
is done (and the result is copied elsewhere in the tree) these values should
better be not used.

=head2 Semantic of visual sections

Two types of visual sections are supported: C<DEADKEYS> and C<KBD>.  A content of
C<DEADKEYS> section is just an embedded (part of) F<.klc> file.  We can read deadkey
mappings and deadkey names from such sections.  The name of the section becomes the
name of the mapping functions which may be used inside the C<Diacritic_*> rule
(or in a recipe for a computed layer).

A content of C<KBD> section consists of C<#>-comment lines and "the mapping 
lines"; every "mapping line" encodes one row in a keyboard (in one or several 
layouts).  (But the make up of rows of this keyboard may be purely imaginary; 
it is normal to have a "keyboard" with one row of numbers 0...9.)
Configuration settings specify how many lines are per row, and how many layers
are encoded by every line, and what are the names of these layers:

 visual_rowcount	# how many config lines per row of keyboard
 visual_per_row_counts 	# Array of length visual_rowcount
 visual_prefixes	# Array of chars; <= visual_rowcount (miss=SPACE)
 prefix_repeat		# How many times prefix char is repeated (n/a to SPACE)
 in_key_separator	# If several layers per row, splits a key-descr
 layer_names		# Where to put the resulting keys array
 in_key_separator2	# If one of entries is longer than 1 char, join by this 
 				# (optional)

Each line consists of a prefix (which is ignored except for sanity checking), and
whitespace-separated list of key descriptions.  (Whitespace followed by a
combining character is not separating.)  Each key description is split using
C<in_key_separator> into slots, one slot per layout.  (The leading 
C<in_key_separator> is not separating.)  Each key/layout
description consists of one or two entries.  An entry is either two dashes
C<--> (standing for empty), or a hex number of length >=4, or a string.
(A hex numbers must be separated by C<.> from neighbor word
characters.)  A loner character which has a different uppercase is
auto-replicated in uppercase (more precisely, titlecase) form.  Missing or empty key/layout description
gives two empty entries (note that the leading key/layout description cannot
be empty; same for "the whole key description" - use the leading C<-->.

If one of the entries in a slot is a string of length ≥ 2, one must separate 
the entries by C<in_key_separator2>.  Likewise, if a slot has only one entry,
and it is longer than 1 char, it must be started or terminated by C<in_key_separator2>.

To simplify BiDi keyboards, a line may optionally be prefixed with the L<C<LRO/RLO>|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode_character_property#Bidirectional_writing>
character; if so, it may optionally be ended by spaces and the L<C<PDF>|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode_character_property#Bidirectional_writing> character.
For compatibility with other components, layer names should not contain characters C<+()[]>.

=head2 Inclusion of F<.klc> files

Instead of including a F<.klc> file (or its part) verbatim in a visual
section, one can make a section C<DEADKEYS/NAME/name1/nm2> with
a key C<klc_filename>.  Filename will be included and parsed as a C<DEADKEYS>
visual section (with name C<DEADKEYS/name1/nm2>???).  (Currently only UTF-16
files are supported.)

=head2 Metadata

A metadata entry is either a string, or an array.  A string behaves as
if were an array with the string repeated sufficiently many times.  Each
personality defines C<MetaData_Index> which chooses the element of the arrays.
The entries

  COMPANYNAME LAYOUTNAME COPYR_YEARS LOCALE_NAME LOCALE_ID
  DLLNAME SORT_ORDER_ID_ LANGUAGE_NAME

should be defined in the personality section, or above this section in the
configuration tree.  (Used when output Windows F<.klc> files and OS X
F<.keylayout> files.)

  OSX_ADD_VERSION OSX_LAYOUTNAME

The first one is the ordinal of the word after which to insert the version
into C<LAYOUTNAME> (OS X allows layout names longer than the limit of 64 UTF-16
codepoints of Windows); the second one allows a completely different name.

Optional metadata currently consists only of C<VERSION> key (the protocol
version; hardwired now as C<1.0>) and keys C<LRM_RLM ALTGR SHIFTLOCK> defining
what goes into the C<ATTRIBUTES> section of F<.klc> file (the latter may also
be specified in a face's section, or its parents).

=head2 Layer/Face/Prefix-key Recipes

The sections C<layer_recipes> and C<face_recipes> contain instructions how
to build Layers and Faces out of simpler elements.  Similar recipes appear  
as values of C<DeadKey_*> entries in a face.  Such a "recipe" is
executed with I<parameters>: a base face name, a layer number, and a prefix
character (the latter is undefined when the recipe is a layer recipe or
face recipe).  (The recipe is free to ignore the parameters; for example, most
recipes ignore the prefix character even when they are "prefix key" recipes.)

The recipes and the visual sections are the most important components of the description
of a keyboard group.

To construct layers of a face, a face recipe is executed several times with different 
"layer number" parameter.  In contrast, in simplest cases a layer recipe is executed
once.  However, when the layer is a part of a compound ("parent") recipe, it inherits 
the "parameters" from the parent.  In particular, it may be executed several times with
different face name (if used in different faces), or with different layer number (if used
- explicitly or explicitly - in different layer slots; for example, C<Mutator(LayerName)>
in a face/prefix-key recipe will execute the C<LayerName> recipe separately for all the
layer numbers; or one can use C<Layers(Empty+LayerName)> together with
C<Layers(LayerName+Other)>).  Depending on the recipe, these calls may result in the same layout 
of the resulting layers, or in different layouts.

A recipe may be of three kinds: it is either a "first comer wins" which is a space-separated collection of
simpler recipes, or C<SELECTOR(COMPONENTS)>, or a "mutator": C<MUTATOR(BASE)> or just C<MUTATOR>.
All recipes must be C<()>-balanced
and C<[]>-balanced; so must be the C<MUTATOR>; in turn, the C<BASE> is either a 
layer name, or another recipe.  A layer name must be defined either in a visual C<KBD> section,
or be a key in the C<layer_recipes> section (so it should not have C<+()[]> characters),
or be the literal C<Empty>.
When C<MUTATOR(BASE)> is processed, first, the resulting layer(s) of the C<BASE> recipe 
are calculated; then the layer(s) are processed by the C<MUTATOR> (one key at a time).

The most important C<SELECTOR> keywords are C<Face> (with argument a face name, defined either
via a C<faces/FACENAME> section, or via C<face_recipes>) and C<Layers> (with argument
of the form C<LAYER_NAME+LAYER_NAME+...>, with layer names defined as above).  Both
select the layer (out of a face, or out of a list) with number equal to the "layer number parameter" in the context
of the recipe.  The C<FlipLayers> builder is similar to C<Face>, but chooses the "other" 
layer ("cyclically the next" layer if more than 2 are present).

The other selectors are C<Self>, C<LinkFace> and C<FlipLayersLinkFace>; they
operate on the base face or face associated to the base face.

The simplest forms of C<MUTATORS> are C<Id, lc, uc, ucfirst, Empty> (note that
C<uc>/C<lc>/C<ucfirst> return C<undefined> when case-conversion results in no
change; use C<maybe_uc>/C<maybe_lc>/C<maybe_ucfirst> if one wants them to behave
as Perl operators).  Recall that a layer
is nothing more than a structure associating a pair "unshifted/shifted character" to the key number, and that
these characters may be undefined.  These simplest mutators modify these characters
independently of their key numbers and shift state (with C<Empty> making all of
them undefined).  Similar user-defined simple mutators are C<ByPairs[PAIRS]>;
here C<PAIRS> consists of pairs "FROM TO" of characters (with optional spaces between pairs);
characters not appearing as FROM become undefined by C<ByPairs>.
(As usual, characters may be replaced by hex numbers with 4 or more hex digits;
separate the number from a neighboring word character by C<.> [dot].)

All mutators must have a form C<WORD> or C<WORD[PARAMETERS]>, with C<PARAMETERS>
C<(),[]>-balanced.  Other simple mutators are C<dectrl> (converts
control-char [those between 0x00 and 0x1f] to the corresponding [uppercase] character), 
C<ShiftFromTo[FROM,TO]> (adds a constant to the [numerical code of the] input character
so that C<FROM> becomes C<TO>), C<SelectRX[PERL_REGEXP]> (keeps input characters
which match, converts everything else to C<undefined>), C<FromTo[LAYER_FROM,LAYER_TO]>
(similar to C<ByPairs>, but pairs all characters in the layers based on their position),
C<DefinedTo[CHAR]> (all defined characters are converted to C<CHAR>).

The mutator C<Imported[NAME]> is similar to <ByPairs>, but takes the F<.klc>-style
visual C<DEADKEYS/NAME> section as the description of the mutation.  C<NAME> may
be followed by a character as in C<NAME,CHAR>; if not, C<CHAR> is the prefix key from
the recipe's execution parameters.

The simple mutator C<ByPairs> has flavors: one can append C<Prefix> or C<InvPrefix>
to the name, and the resulting characters become prefix keys (the “C<AltGr>-inverted”
prefix followed by C<CHAR> behaves as non-inverted prefix followed by C<AltGr-CHAR>).

Some mutators pay attention not only to what the character is, but how it is 
accessible on the given key: such are C<FlipShift>, C<FlipLayers>, 
C<FromToFlipShift[LAYER_FROM,LAYER_TO]>.  Some other mutators also take into
account how the key is positioned with respect to the other keys.

C<ByColumns[CHARS]> assigns a character
to a particular column of the keyboard.  Which keys are in which columns is 
governed by how the corresponding
visual layer is formatted (shifted to the right by C<keyline_offsets> array of the
visual layer).  This visual layer is one associated to the face by the
C<geometry_via_layer> key (and the face is the parameter face of the
mutator).  C<CHARS> is a comma-separated list;
empty positions map to the undefined character.

C<ByRows[MUTATORS]> chooses a mutator based on the row of the keyboard.  On the top row,
it is the first mutator which is chosen, etc. The list C<MUTATORS> is separated by C<///> 
surrounded by whitespace.

The mutator C<InheritPrefixKeys[FACE_FROM]> converts some non-prefix characters to prefix
characters; the conversion happens if the argument of the mutator coincides with 
what is at the corresponding position in C<FACE_FROM>, and this position contains
a prefix character.  (Nowadays this mutator is not very handy — most of its uses 
may be accomplished by having I<inheritable> prefix characters in appropriate faces.)

The mutators C<NotId(BASEFACE FACES)>, C<NotSameKey(BASEFACE FACES)> process their 
argument in a special way: the characters in C<FACES> which duplicated the characters 
present (on the same key, and possibly with the same modifiers) in C<BASEFACE> are
ignored.  The remaining characters are combined “as usual” with “the first comer wins”.

The most important mutator is C<Mutate> (and its flavors).  (See L<The C<Mutate[RULES]> mutator>.)

Note that C<Id(LAYERNAME)> is similar to a selector;
it is the only way to insert a
layer without a selector, since a bareword is interpreted as a C<MUTATOR>; C<Id(LAYERNAME)> is a synonym
of C<Layers(LAYERNAME+LAYERNAME+...)> (repeated as many times as there are layers
in the parameter "base face").


The recipes in a space-separated list of recipes ("first comer wins") are 
interpreted independently to give a collection of layers to combine; then,
for every key numbers and both shift states, one takes the leftmost recipe 
which produces a defined character for this position, and the result is put 
into the resulting layer.

Keep in mind that to understand what a recipe does, one should trace 
its description right-to-left order: for example, C<ByPairs[.:](FlipLayers)> creates
a layout where C<:> is at position of C<.>, but on the second [=other] layer (essentially,
if the base layout is the standard one, it binds the character C<:> to the keypress C<AltGr-.>).

To simplify formatting of F<.kbdd> files, a recipe may be an array reference.
The string may be split on spaces, or split after comma or C<|>.

=head2 The C<Mutate[RULES]> mutator

The essense of C<Mutate> is to have several mutation rules and choose I<the best>
of the results of application of these rules.  Grouping the rules allows
one a flexible way to control what I<the best> actually means.  The rules may
be separated by comma, by C<|>, or by C<|||> (interchangeable with C<||||>).

In the simplest case of grouping, C<RULES> form a C<|>-separated list, and
each group consists of one rule.  Then I<the best> result is one coming from
an earlier rule.  The groups are separated by C<|>, and the rules inside the
group are separated by comma; if more than one rule appears in a group, a
different kind of competition appears (inside the group).  

The I<quality> of the generated characters is a list C<UNICODE_AGE, HONEST, 
UNICODE_BLOCK, IN_CASE_PAIR, FROM_NON_ALTGR_POSITION>
with lexicographical order (the earlier element is stronger that ones after it).
Here C<HONEST> describes whether a character is generated by
Unicode compositing (versus “compatibility compositing” or other
“artificially generated” mogrifiers); the older age wins, as well as
honest compositing, earlier Unicode blocks, as well as case pairs and
characters from non-C<AltGr>-positions.  (Experience shows that these rules
have a pretty good correlation with being “more suitable for human consumption”.)

Moreover, quality in case-pairs is equalized by assigning the strongest 
I<quality> of two.  Such pairs are always considered “tied together” when
they compete with other characters.  (In particular, if a single character
with higher quality occupies one of C<Shifted/Unshifted> positions, a
case pair with lower quality is completely ignored; so the “other” position 
may be taken by a single character with yet lower quality.)

In addition, the characters which lost the competition for
non-C<AltGr>-positions are considered I<again> on C<AltGr>-positions.  (With
boosted priority compared to mutated C<AltGr>-characters; see above.)

This mutator comes in several flavors: one can append to its name
C<SpaceOK>/C<Hack>/C<DupsOK>/C<32OK> (in this
order).  Unless C<SpaceOK> is specified, it will not modify characters on a key
which produces C<SPACE> when used without modifiers.  Unless C<32OK> is specified, it
will not produce Unicode characters after C<0xFFFF> (the default is to follow
the brain-damaged semantic of prefix keys on Windows).  Unless C<DupsOK> is
specified, the result is optimized by removing duplicates (per key) generated
by application of C<RULES>.  With the C<Hack> modifier, the generated characters
are not counted as “obtained by logical rules” when statistics for the generated
keyboard layout are calculated.

=head2 Linked prefixes

On top of what is explained above, there is a way to arrange “linking” of two prefix keys;
this linking allows characters which cannot be fit on one (prefixed) key to
“migrate” to unassigned positions on the otherwise-prefixed key.  (This is
similar to migration from non-C<AltGr>-position to C<AltGr>-position.)
This is achieved by using mutator rules of the following form:

  primary	= 		+PRE-GROUPS1|||SHARED||||POST-GROUPS1
  secondary	= PRE-GROUPS2||||PRE-GROUPS1|||SHARED||||POST-GROUPS2

Groups with digits are not shared (specific to a particular prefix); C<SHARED> is
(effectively) reverted when accessed from the secondary prefix; for the
secondary key, the recipies from C<SHARED> which were used in the primary 
key are removed from C<SHARED>, and are appended to the end of C<POST-GROUPS2>;
the C<PRE-GROUPS1> are skipped when finding assignments for the secondary
prefix.

In the primary recipe, C<|||> and C<||||> are interchangeable with C<|>.
Moreover, if C<POST-GROUPS2> is empty, the secondary recipe should be written as

  secondary	= PRE-GROUPS2|||PRE-GROUPS1|||SHARED

if C<PRE-GROUPS1> is empty, this should be written as one of

  secondary	= PRE-GROUPS2|||SHARED
  secondary	= PRE-GROUPS2||||SHARED
  secondary	= PRE-GROUPS2||||SHARED||||POST-GROUPS2

These rules are to allow macro-ization of the common parts of the primary
and secondary recipe.  Put the common parts as a value of the key
C<Named_DIA_Recipe__***> (here C<***> denotes a word), and replace them by
the macro C<< <NAMED-***> >> in the recipes.

B<Implementation>: the primary key recipe starts with the C<+> character; it
forces interpretation of C<|||> and C<||||> as of ordinary C<|>.

If not I<primary>, the top-level groups are formed by C<||||> (if present), otherwise by C<|||>. 
The number of top-level groups should be at most 3.  The second of C<||||>-groups
may have at most 2 C<|||>-groups; there should be no other subdivision.  This way,
there may be up to 4 groups with different roles.

The second of 3 toplevel C<|||>-groups, or the first of two sublevel C<|||>-groups
is the “skip” group.  The last of two or three toplevel C<|||>-groups (or of 
sublevel C<|||>-groups, or the 2nd toplevel C<||||>-group without subdivisions) is the 
inverted group; the 3rd of toplevel C<||||>-groups is the “extra” group.

“Penalize/prohibit” lists start anew in every top-level group.

=head2 Atomic mutators rules

As explained above, the individual RULES in C<Mutate[RULES]> may be
separated by C<,> or C<|>, or C<|||> or C<||||>.  Such an individual
rule is a combination of I<atomic rules> combined by C<+> operators,
and/or preceded by C<-> prefix (with understanding that C<+-> must
be replaced by C<-->).  The prefix C<-> means I<inversion> of the
rule; the operator C<+> is the composition of the rules.

B<Example:> the atomic rule C<< <super> >> converts its input character into
its superscript forms (if such forms exist; for example, C<a> may
be converted to C<ᵃ> or C<ª>).  The atomic rules C<lc>, C<uc>, C<ucfirst>
behave the same as the corresponding MUTATORs.   The atomic rule C<dectrl>
converts a control-character to the corresponding “uppercase” character:
C<^A> is converted to C<A>, and C<^\> is converted to C<\>.  (The last
4 rules cannot be inverted by C<->.)

The composition is performed (as usual) from right to left.  B<Example:> the
indivial rule C<< <super>+lc+dectrl >> converts C<^A> to C<ᵃ> or C<ª>.

In addition to rules listed above, the atomic rules may be of the
following types:

=over

=item *

A hex number with ≥4 digits, or a character: implements the composition
inverting (compatibility or not) Unicode decompositions into two characters;
the character in the rule must the first character of the decomposition.
Here “Unicode decompositions” are either deduced from Unicode decomposition
rules (with compatibility decompositions having lower priority), or deduced
basing on splitting the name of the character into parts.

=item *

C<< <pseudo-upgrade> >> is an inversion of a Unicode decomposition which goes from
1 character to 1 character.

=item *

Flavors of characters C<< <FLAVOR> >> from Unicode tables come from Unicode 
1-character to 1-character decompositions
marked with C<< <FLAVOR> >>.  B<Example:> C<< <sub> >> for a subscript form;
or C<< <final> >>.

=item *

C<< <font=***> >> rules TBC ..........................................

=item *

Calculated rules C<< <pseudo-calculated-***> >> are extracted by a 
heuristic algorithm which tries to parse the Unicode name of the character.

For the best understanding of what these rules produce, inspect
results of print_compositions(), print_decompositions() methods documented
in L<"SYNOPSIS">.  The following “keywords” are processed by the algorithm:

  WITH, OVER, ABOVE, PRECEDED BY, BELOW (only with LONG DASH)

are separators;
  
  COMBINING CYRILLIC LETTER, BARRED, SLANTED, APPROXIMATELY, ASYMPTOTICALLY, 
  SMALL (not near LETTER), ALMOST, SQUARED, BIG, N-ARY, LARGE, LUNATE,
  SIDEWAYS DIAERESIZED, SIDEWAYS OPEN, INVERTED, ARCHAIC, EPIGRAPHIC,
  SCRIPT, LONG, MATHEMATICAL, AFRICAN, INSULAR, VISIGOTHIC, MIDDLE-WELSH,
  BROKEN, TURNED, INSULAR, SANS-SERIF, REVERSED, OPEN, CLOSED, DOTLESS, TAILLESS, FINAL
  BAR, SYMBOL, OPERATOR, SIGN, ROTUNDA, LONGA, IN TRIANGLE, SMALL CAPITAL (as smallcaps)

are modifiers.  For an C<APL FUNCTIONAL SYMBOL>, one scans for

  QUAD, UNDERBAR, TILDE, DIAERESIS, VANE, STILE, JOT, OVERBAR, BAR

TBC ..........................................

=item *

Additionally, C<esh/eng/ezh> are considered C<pseudo-phonetized> variants of
their middle letter, as well as C<SCHWA> of C<0>.

=item *

C<< <pseudo-fake-***> >> rules are obtained by scanning the name for

  WHITE, BLACK, CIRCLED, BUT NOT 

as well as for C<UM> (as C<umify>), paleo-Latin digraphs and C<CON/VEND> 
(as C<paleocontraction-by-last>), doubled-letters
(as C<doubleletter>), C<MIDDLE-WELSH> doubled-letters
(as C<doubleletter-middle-welsh>), C<MODIFIER LETTER> (possibly with C<RAISED>

=head2 The C<Mutate2Self> mutator

TBC ..............................

=head2 Pseudo-mutators for generation of documentation

A few mutators do not introduce any characters (in other words, they behave as 
C<Empty>) but are used for their side effects: in prefix-key recipes, 
C<PrefixDocs[STRING]> introduces documentation of what the prefix key is intended
for.  Likewise, C<HTML_classes[HOW]> allows adding CSS classes to highlight 
parts of HTML output generated by this module, the parts corresponding to selected
characters in a face.

C<HOW> is a comma-separated list, every triple in the
list being C<WHERE,HTML_CLASS,CHARACTERS>.  C<WHERE> is one of C<k>/C<K> (which
add formatting to the key containing one of the C<CHARACTERS>) or C<c>/C<C>
(which add formatting to an individual character displayed on the key),
one can add a digit to C<WHERE> to limit to a particular layer in the face
(useful when a character appears several times in a face).
The lower-case variants select characters basing on the I<base face> of a key.
One can also append C<=CONTEXT> to C<WHERE>, then the class is added only if
C<CONTEXT> appears as one of the options for the HTML output generator.

The CSS rules generated by this module support several classes directly; the
rest should be supported by the user-supplied rules.  The classes with existing
support are: on keys

  to_w from_w				# generate arrows between keys
  from_nw from_ne to_nw to_ne		# generate arrows between keys; will yellow-outline
  pure					# 	unless combined with this
  red-bg green-bg blue-bg		# tint the key as the whole (as background)

On characters

  very-special need-learn may-guess	# provide green/brown/yellow-outlines
  special				# provide blue outline (thick unless combined with 
  thinspecial				#                   <-- this)

=head2 Extra CSS classes for documentation

In additional, several CSS classes are auto-generated basing on Unicode
properties of the character.  TBC ........................

=head2 Debugging mutators

If the bit 0x40 of the environment variable C<UI_KEYBOARDLAYOUT_DEBUG> 
(decimal or C<0xHEX>) is set, debugging output for mutators is enabled:

  r ║ ║   ┆ ║ ṙ ṛ ┆ ║ ║ ║ ║ ⓡ ┆
    ║ ║   ┆ ║ Ṙ Ṛ ┆ ║ ║ ║ ║ Ⓡ ┆
    ║ ║ ặ ┆ ║     ┆ ║ ║ ║ ║   ┆
    ║ ║ Ặ ┆ ║     ┆ ║ ║ ║ ║   ┆
  Extracted [ …list… ] deadKey=00b0

The output contains a line per character assigned to the keyboard key (if 
there are 2 layers, each with lc/uc variants, there are 4 lines); empty lines are 
omitted.  The first column indicates the base character (lc of the 1st layer) of 
the key; the separator C<║> indicates C<|>-groups in the mutator.  Above, the first
group produces no mutations, the second group mutates only the characters in
the second layer, and the third group produces two mutations per a character in
the first layer.  The 7th group is also producing mogrifications on the 1st layer.

The next example clarifies C<┆>-separator: to the left of it are mogrifications which 
come in case pairs, to the right are mogrifications where mogrified-lc is not
a case pair of mogrified-uc:

  t ║ ║ ᵵ ║ ꞇ ┆ ʇ ║   ┆ ║
    ║ ║   ║ Ꞇ ┆ ᴛ ║   ┆ ║
    ║ ║   ║   ┆   ║ ꝧ ┆ ║
    ║ ║   ║   ┆   ║ Ꝧ ┆ ║
  Extracted [ …list… ] deadKey=02dc

In this one, C<│> separates mogrifications with different priorities (based on
Unicode ages, whether the atomic mutator was compatibility/synthetic one, and the
Unicode block).

  / ║ ║ ║ ║ ║   │ ∴   ║ ║
    ║ ║ ║ ║ ║   │ ≘ ≗ ║ ║
    ║ ║ ║ ║ ║ / │ ⊘   ║ ║
  Extracted [ …list… ] deadKey=00b0

For secondary mogrifiers, where the distinction between C<|||> and C<|> 
matters, some of the C<║>-separators are replaced by C<┃>.  Additionally,
there are two rounds of extraction: first the characters corresponding
to the primary mogrifier are TMP-extracted (from the groups PRE-GROUPS1, 
COMMON); then what is the extracted from COMMON is put back at the 
effective end (at the end of POST-GROUPS2, or, if no such, at 
the beginning of COMMON):

  t ║ ║ ᵵ ┃ ┃ ʇ │   │ ꞇ ┆ ║
    ║ ║   ┃ ┃   │ ᴛ │ Ꞇ ┆ ║
    ║ ║   ┃ ┃   │   │ ꝧ ┆ ║
    ║ ║   ┃ ┃   │   │ Ꝧ ┆ ║
  TMP Extracted: <…list…> from layers 0 0 | 0 0
  t ║ ║ ᵵ ┃ ꞇ ┆ ʇ ┋ ┃ ┆ │ ┆ │   ┆ ║
    ║ ║   ┃ Ꞇ ┆ ᴛ ┋ ┃ ┆ │ ┆ │   ┆ ║
    ║ ║   ┃   ┆   ┋ ┃ ┆ │ ┆ │ ꝧ ┆ ║
    ║ ║   ┃   ┆   ┋ ┃ ┆ │ ┆ │ Ꝧ ┆ ║
  Extracted [ …list… ] deadKey=02dc

In the second part of the debugging output, the part of common which is put
back is separated by C<┋>.

When bit 0x80 is set, much more lower-level debugging info is printed.  The
arrays at separate depth mean: group number, priority, not-cased-pair, layer
number, subgroup, is-uc.  When bit 0x100 is set, the debugging output for
combining atomic mutators is enabled.

=head2 Personalities

A personality C<NAME> is defined in the section C<faces/NAME>.  (C<NAME> may
include slashes - untested???)

An array C<layers> gives the list of layers forming the face.  (As of version
0.03, only 2 layers are supported.)  The string C<LinkFace> is a “fallback”
face: if a keypress is not defined by C<layers>, it would be taken from
C<LinkFace>; additionally, it affects the C<Compose> key bindings: for example,
if C<LinkFace> has C<g> where C<layers> has C<γ>, and there is a binding for 
C<Compose g>, the same binding applies for C<Compose γ>.
.........

=head2 Substitutions

In section C<Substitutions> one defines composition rules which may be
used on par with composition rules extracted from I<Unicode Character Database>.
An array C<FOO> is converted to a hash accessible as C<< <subst-FOO> >> from
a C<Diacritic> filter of satellite face processor.  An element of the the array
must consist of two characters (the first is mapped to the second one).  If
both characters have upper-case variants, the translation between these variants
is also included.

=head2 Classification of diacritics

The section C<Diacritics> contains arrays each describing a class of
diacritic marks.  Each array may contain up to 7 elements, each
consising of diacritic marks in the order of similarity to the
"principal" mark of the array.  Combining characters may be
preceded by horizontal space.  Seven elements should contain:

 Surrogate chars; 8bit chars; Modifiers
 Modifiers below (or above if the base char is below)
 Vertical (or Comma-like or Doubled or Dotlike or Rotated or letter-like) Modifiers
 Prime-like or Centered modifiers
 Combining 
 Combining below (or above if base char is below)
 Vertical combining and dotlike Combining

These lists determine what a C<Diacritic2Self> filter of satellite face processor 
will produce when followed by whitespace characters 
(possibly with modifiers) C<SPACE ENTER TAB BACKSPACE>.  (So, if F<.kbdd> file
uses C<Diacritic2Self>) this determines what diacritic prefix keys produce.

=head2 Compose Key

The scalar configuration variable C<ComposeKey> controls the ID of the prefix
key to access F<.Compose> composition rules.  The rules are read from files
in the class/object variable; set this variable with

  $self->set__value('ComposeFiles', [@Files]);	# Class name (instead of $self) is OK here

The format of the files is the same as for X11’s F<.Compose> (but C<includes> are
not supported); only compositions starting with C<< <Multi_Key> >>, having no
deadkeys, and (on Windows) expanding to 1 UTF-16 codepoint are processed.  (See
L<“systematic” parts of rules in the standard
F<.XCompose>|"“Systematic” parts of rules in a few .XCompose"> — see lines with postfix C<s>.)

Repeating this prefix twice accesses characters via their HTML/MathML entity names.  The files
are as above (the variable name is C<EntityFiles>); the format is the same as in
F<bycodes.html>.

Repeating this prefix 3 times accesses characters via their C<rfc1345> codes;
the variable C<rfc1345Files> contains files in the format of F<rfc1345.html>.
It is recommended to download these files (or the later flavors)

  http://www.x.org/releases/X11R7.6/doc/libX11/Compose/en_US.UTF-8.html
  http://www.w3.org/TR/xml-entity-names/bycodes.html
  http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1345

See L<"SYNOPSIS"> for an example.  Note that this mechanism does not assign this
prefix key to any particular position on the keyboard layout; this should be
done elsewhere.  Implementation detail: if some of these 3 maps cannot be created,
they are skipped (so less than 3 chained maps are created).

For more control, one can make this configuration variable into an array.  The
value C<KEY> is equivalent to the array with elements

  ComposeFiles,dotcompose,warn,KEY
  EntityFiles,entity,warn,,KEY
  rfc1345Files,rfc1345,warn,,KEY

Five comma-separated fields are: the variable controlling the filelist, 
the type of files in the filelist (only the 3 listed types are supported now),
whether to warn when a particular flavor 
of composition table could not be loaded, the global access prefix, the prefix 
for access from the previous element (chained access).

If C<ComposeFiles> (etc.) has more than 1 file, bindings from earlier files
take precedence over bindings from the later ones.  If the same sequence is
bound several times inside a file, a later binding takes precedence.

=head2 Names of prefix keys

Section C<DEADKEYS> defines naming of prefix keys.  If not named there (or in
processed F<.klc> files), the C<PrefixDocs> property will be used; if none, 
Unicode name of the character will be used.

=head2 More than 2 layers and/or exotic modifier keys

This is controlled by C<output_layers>, C<mods_keys_KBD>, and C<layers_mods_keys>
configuration arrays.  TBC..................................

=head2 CAVEATS for German/French/BÉPO/Neo keyboards

Non-US keycaps: the character "a" is on C<(VK_)A>, but its scancode is now different.
E.g., French's A is on 0x10, which is US's Q.  Our table of scancodes is
currently hardwired.  Some pictures and tables are available on

  http://bepo.fr/wiki/Pilote_Windows

With this module, the scancode and the C<VK_>-code for a position in a layout
are calculated via the C<BaseLayer> configuration variable; the first recognized 
character at the given position of this layer is translated to
the C<VK_>-code (using a hardwired table).  The mapping of C<VK_>-codes 
to scancodes is currently hardwired.

For “unusual” keys, one can use the C<VK> subsection of the face to describe
its scancode (the first entry in the array) and the bindings.  If the scancode
is empty, the name of the key is translated to a scancode using the hardwired
tables.

=head1 Keyboards: on ease of access (What makes an easy-to-use keyboard layout)

The content of this section has no I<direct> relationship to the functionality
of this module.  However, we feel that it is better that the user of this
module understands these concerns.  Moreover, it is these concerns which
lead to the principles underlying the functionality of this module.

=head2 On the needs of keyboard layout users

Let's start with trivialities: different people have different needs
with respect to keyboard layouts.  For a moment, ignore the question
of the repertoir of characters available via keyboard; then the most 
crucial distinction corresponds to a certain scale.  In absense of  
a better word, we use a provisional name "the required typing speed".

One example of people on the "quick" (or "rabid"?) pole of this scale are 
people who type a lot of text which is either "already prepared", or for 
which the "quality of prose" is not crucial.  Quite often, these people may
type in access of 100 words per minute.  For them, the most important
questions are of physical exhaustion from typing.  The position
of most frequent letters relative to the "rest" finger position, whether
frequently typed together letters are on different hands (or at least
not on the same/adjacent fingers), the distance fingers must travel
when typing common words, how many keypresses are needed to reach 
a letter/symbol which is not "on the face fo the keyboard" - their
primary concerns are of this kind.

On the other, "deliberate", pole these concerns cease to be crucial.
On this pole are people who type while they "create" the text, and
what takes most of their focus is this "creation" process.  They may
"polish their prose", or the text they write may be overburdened by
special symbols - anyway, what they concentrate on is not the typing itself.

For them, the details of the keyboard layout are important mostly in
the relation to how much they I<distract> the writer from the other
things the writer is focused on.  The primary question is now not
"how easy it is to type this", but "how easy it is to I<recall> how
to type this".  The focus transfers from the mechanics of finger movements
to the psycho/neuro/science of memory.

These questions are again multifaceted: there are symbols one encounters
every minute; after you recall once how to access them, most probably
you won't need to recall them again - until you have a long interval when
you do not type.  The situation is quite different with symbols you need
once per week - most probably, each time you will need to call them again
and again.  If such rarely used symbols/letters are frequenct (since I<many>
of them appear), it is important to have an easy way to find how to type them;
on the other hand, probably there is very little need for this way to
be easily memorizable.  And for symbols which you need once per day, one needs
both an easy way to find how to type them, I<and> the way to type them should
better be easily memorizable.

Now add to this the fact that for different people (so: different usage
scenarios) this division into "all the time/every minute/every day/every week"
categories is going to be different.  And one should not forget important
scenario of going to vacation: when you return, you need to "reboot" your
typing skills from the dormant state.

=head2 On “mixing” several “allied” layouts

On the other hand, note that the questions discussed above are more or less
orthogonal: if the logic of recollection requires ω to be related in some 
way to the W-key,
then it does not matter where the W-key is on the keyboard - the same logic
is applicable to the QWERTY base layou	t, or BÉPO one, or Colemak, or Dvorak.
This module concerns itself I<only> with the questions of "consistency" and
the related question of "the ease of recall"; we care only about which symbols
relate to which "base keys", and do not care about where the base key sit on
the physical keyboard.

B<EXCEPTIONS:> The “main island” of the keyboard contains a 4×10 rectangle
of keys.  So if a certain collection of special keys may be easily memorized
as a rectangular table, it is nice to be able to map this table to the
physical keyboard layout.  This module contains tool making this task easy.

Now consider the question of the character repertoir: a person may need ways
to type "continuously" in several languages; quite often one must must type
a “standalone” foreign word in a sentence; in addition to this, there may
be a need to I<occasionally> type "standalone" characters or symbols outside
the repertoir of these languages.  Moreover, these languages may use different
scripts (such as Polish/Bulgarian/Greek/Arabic/Japanese), or may share a
"bulk" of their characters, and differ only in some "exceptional letters".
To add insult to injury, these "exceptional letters" may be rare in the language
(such as ÿ in French or à in Swedish) or may have a significant letter frequency 
(such as é in French) or be somewhere in between (such as ñ in Spanish).

And the non-language symbols do not need to be the I<math> symbols (although
often they are).  An Engish-language discussion of etimology at the coffee table 
may lead to a need to write down a word in polytonic greek, or old norse;
next moment one would need to write a phonetic transcription in IPA/APA
symbols.  A discussion of keyboard layout may involve writing down symbols
for non-character keys of the keyboard.  A typography freak would optimize
a document by fine-tuned whitespaces.  Almost everybody needs arrows symbols,
and many people would use box drawing characters if they had a simple access
to them.

Essentially, this means that as far as it does not impacts other accessibility
goals, it makes sense to have unified memorizable access to as many
symbols/characters as possible.  (An example of impacting other aspects:
MicroSoft's (and IBM's) "US International" keyboards steal characters C<`~'^">:
typing them produces "unexpected results" - they are deadkeys.  This
significantly simplifies entering characters with accents, but makes it
harder to enter non-accented characters.)

=head2 The simplest rules of design of “large” keyboard layouts

One of the most known principles of design of human-machine interaction
is that "simple common tasks should be simple to perform, and complicated
tasks should be possible to perform".  I strongly disagree with this
principle - IMO, it lacks a very important component: "a gradual increase
in complexity".  When a certain way of doing things is easy to perform, and another 
similar way is still "possible to perform", but on a very elevated level 
of complexity, this leads to a significant psychological barrier erected
between these two ways.  Even when switching from the first way to the other one 
has significant benefits, this barrier leads to self-censorship.  Essentially,
people will 
ignore the benefits even if they exceed the penalty of "the elevated level of 
complexity" mentioned above.  And IMO self-censorship is the worst type of 
censorship.  (There is a certain similarity between this situation and that
of "self-fulfilled prophesies".  "People won't want to do this, so I would not
make it simpler to do" - and now people do not want to do this...)

So I would add another clause to the law above: "and moderately complicated
tasks should remain moderately hard to perform".  What does it tell us in
the situation of keyboard layout?  One can separate several levels of
complexity.

=over 10

=item Basic:

There should be some "base keyboards": keyboard layouts used for continuous 
typing in a certain language or script.  Access from one base keyboard to
letters of another should be as simple as possible.

=item By parts:

If a symbol can be thought of as a combination of certain symbols accessible
on the base keyboard, one should be able to "compose" the symbol: enter it
by typing a certain "composition prefix" key then the combination (as far
as the combination is unambiguously associated to one symbol).

The "thoughts" above should be either obvious (as in "combining a and e should 
give æ") or governed by simple mneumonic rules; the rules should cover as
wide a range as possible (as in "Greek/Coptic/Hebrew/Russian letters are
combined as G/C/H/R and the corresponding Latin letter; the correspondence is 
phonetic, or, in presence of conflicts, visual").

=item Quick access:

As many non-basic letters as possible (of those expected to appear often)
should be available via shortcuts.  Same should be applicable to starting
sequences of composition rules (such as "instead of typing C<StartCompose>
and C<'> one can type C<AltGr-'>).

=item Smart access

Certain non-basic characters may be accessible by shortcuts which are not
based on composition rules.  However, these shortcuts should be deducible
by using simple mneumonic rules (such as "to get a vowel with `-accent,
type C<AltGr>-key with the physical keyboard's key sitting below the vowel key").

=item Superdeath:

If everything else fails, the user should be able to enter a character by
its Unicode number (preferably in the most frequently referenced format:
hexadecimal).

=back

=over

B<NOTE:> This does not seem to be easily achievable, but it looks like a very nifty
UI: a certain HotKey is reserved (e.g., C<AltGr-AppMenu>);
when it is tapped, and a character-key is pressed (for example, B<B>) a
menu-driven interface pops up where user may navigate to different variants
of B, Beta, etc - each of variants with a hotkey to reach I<NOW>, and with
instructions how to reach it later from the keyboard without this UI.

Also: if a certain timeout passes after pressing the initial HotKey, an instruction
what to do next should appear.

=back

=head2 The finer rules of design of “large” keyboard layouts

Here are the finer points elaborating on the levels of complexity discussed above:

=over 4

=item 1

It looks reasonable to allow "fuzzy mneumonic rules": the rules which specify
several possible variants where to look for the shortcut (up to 3-4 variants).
If/when one forgets the keying of the shortcut, but remembers such a rule,
a short experiment with these positions allows one to reconstruct the lost
memory.

=item

The "base keyboards" (those used for continuous typing in a certain language
or script) should be identical to some "standard" widely used keyboards.
These keyboards should differ from each other in position of keys used by the
scripts only; the "punctuation keys" should be in the same position.  If a
script B has more letters than a script A, then a lot of
"punctuation" on the layout A will be replaced by letters in the layout B.
This missing punctuation should be made available by pressing a modifier
(C<AltGr>? compare with L<MicroSoft's Vietnamese keyboard|http://www.microsoft.com/resources/msdn/goglobal/keyboards/kbdvntc.html>'s top row).

=item

If more than one base keyboard is used, there must be a quick access:
if one needs to enter one letter from layout B when the active layout is A, one
should not be forced to switch to B, type the letter, then switch back
to A.  It should better be available I<also> on a prefixed combination "C<Quick_Access_Key letter>".

=item

One should consider what the C<Quick_Access_Key> does when the layouts A
and B are identical on a particular key (e.g., punctuation).  One can go with the "Occam's
razor" approach and make the C<Quick_Access_Key> prefix into the do-nothing identity map.
The alternative is make it access some symbols useful both for
script A and script B.  It is a judgement call.

Note that there is a gray area when layouts A and B are not identical,
but a key C<K> produces punctuation in layout A, and a letter in layout
B.  Then when in layout B, this punctuation is available on C<AltGr-key>,
so, in principle, C<Quick_Access_Key> would duplicate the functionality
of C<AltGr>.  Compare with "there is more than one way to do it" below;
remember that OS (or misbehaving applications) may make some keypresses
"unavailable".  I feel that in these situations, “having duplication” is
a significant advantage over “having some extra symbols available”.

=item

The considerations in two preceding parts are applicable also in the
case when there are more “allied” layouts than A and B.  Ways to make it possible
are numerous: one can have several alternative C<Quick_Access_Key>’s, B<and> one
can use a I<repeated> prefix key C<Quick_Access_Key>.  With a large enough
collection of layouts, a combination of both approaches may be visualized
as a chain of layout

S< >… C<L_Quick³ L_Quick² L_Quick> B<Base> C<R_Quick R_Quick² R_Quick³> …

here we have two quick access prefix keys, the left one C<L_Quick>, and the right one
C<R_Quick>.  Superscripts C<² ³ …> mean “pressing the prefix key several times”;
the prefix keys move one left/right along the chain of layouts.

=item

The three preceding parts were concerned with entering one character from
an “allied” layout.  To address another frequent need, entering one word
from an “allied” layout, yet another approach may be needed.  The solution may
be to use a certain combination of modifier keys.  (How to choose useful
combinations?  See: L<"A convenient assignment of KBD* bitmaps to modifier keys">.)

(Using “exotic” modifier keys may be impossible in some badly coded applications.
This should not stop one from implementing this feature: sometimes one has a choice
from several applications performing the same task.  Moreover, since this feature
is a “frill”, there is no pressing need to have it I<always> available.)

=item

Paired symbols (such as such as ≤≥, «», ‹›, “”, ‘’ should be put on paired 
keyboard's keys: <> or [] or ().

=item

"Directional symbols" (such as arrows) should be put either on numeric keypad
or on a 3×3 subgrid on the letter-part of the keyboard (such as QWE/ASD/ZXC).
(Compare with [broken?] implementation in L<Neo2|http://www.mzuther.de/en/contents/osd-neo2>.)

=item

for symbols that are naturally thought of as sitting in a table, one can 
create intuitive mapping of quite large tables to the keyboard.  Split each
key in halves by a horizontal line, think of C<Shift-key> as sitting in the
top half.  Then ignoring C<`~> key and most of punctuation on the right
hand side, keyboard becomes an 8×10 grid.  Taking into account C<AltGr>
modifier (either as an extra bit, or as splitting a key by a horizontal line),
one can map up to 8×10×2 (or 8×20) table to a keyboard.

B<Example:> Think of L<IPA consonants|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet#Consonants>.

=item

Cheatsheets are useful.  And there are people who are ready to dedicate a
piece of their memory to where on a layout is a particularly useful to them
symbol.  So even if there is no logical position for a certain symbol, but
there is an empty slot on layout, one should not hesitate in using this slot.

However, this I<will be> distractive to people who do not want to dedicate
their memory to "special cases".  So it makes sense to have three kinds of
cheatsheets for layouts: one with special cases ignored (useful for most 
people), one with all general cases ignored (useful for checks "is this 
symbol available in some place I do not know about" and for memorization),
and one with all the bells and whistles.

(Currently this module allows emitting HTML keyboard layouts with such
information indicated by classes in markup.  The details may be treated
by the CSS rules.)

=item

"There is more than one way to do it" is not a defect, it is an asset.
If it is a reasonable expectation to find a symbol X on keypress K', and
the same holds for keypress K'' I<and> they both do not conflict with other
"being intuitive" goals, go with both variants.  Same for 3 variants, 4
- now you get my point.

B<Example:> The standard Russian phonetic layout has Ё on the C<^>-key; on the
other hand, Ё is a variant of Е; so it makes sense to have Ё available on
C<AltGr-Е> as well.  Same for Ъ and Ь.

=item

Dead keys which are "abstract" (as opposed to being related to letters
engraved on physical keyboard) should better be put on modified state
of "zombie" keys of the keyboard (C<SPACE>, C<TAB>, C<CAPSLOCK>, C<MENU_ACCESS>).

B<NOTE:> Making C<Shift-Space> a prefix key may lead to usability issues
for people used to type CAPITALIZED PHRASES by keeping C<Shift> pressed
all the time.  As a minimum, the symbols accessed via C<Shift-SPACE key>
should be strikingly different from those produced by C<key> so that
such problems are noted ASAP.  Example: on the first sight, producing
C<NO-BREAK SPACE> on C<Shift-Space Shift-Space> or C<Shift-Space Space>
looks like a good idea.  Do not do this: the visually undistinguishable
C<NO-BREAK SPACE> would lead to significantly hard-to-debug problems if
it was unintentional.

=head2 Explanation of keyboard layout terms used in the docs

The aim of this module is to make keyboard layout design as simple as 
possible.  It turns out that even very elaborate designs can be made
quickly and the process is not very error-prone.  It looks like certain
venues not tried before are now made possible; at least I'm not aware of 
other attempts in this direction.  One can make layouts which can be
"explained" very concisely, while they contain thousand(s) of accessible
letters.

Unfortunately, being on unchartered territories, in my explanations I'm 
forced to use home-grown terms.  So be patient with me...  The terms are
I<keyboard layout group>, I<keyboard>, I<face> and I<layer>.  (One may want compare them
with what ISO 9995 does: L<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_9995>….  On
the other hand, most parts of ISO 9995 look as remote from being ergonomic
[in the sense discussed in these sections] as one may imagine!)

In what follows,
the words I<letter> and I<character> are used interchangeably.  A I<key> 
means a physical key on a keyboard tapped (possibly together with 
one of modifiers C<Shift>, C<AltGr> - or, rarely, L<[right] C<Control>|http://www.microsoft.com/resources/msdn/goglobal/keyboards/kbdcan.html>;
more advanced layouts may use “extra” modifiers).  The key C<AltGr> 
is often marked as such on the keycap, otherwise it is just the "right" C<Alt> key; at least
on Windows, for many simple layouts it can be replaced by C<Control-Alt>.  What is a I<prefix key>? 
Tapping such a key does not produce any letter, but modifies what the next
keypress would do (sometimes it is called a I<dead key>; in C<ISO 9995> terms,
it is probably a I<latching key>.  Sometimes, prefix keys may be “chained”; then
insertion of a character happens not on the second keypress, but on the third one [or fourth/etc]).

To describe which character (or a prefix) is produced by a keypress one must describe
I<the context>: which prefix keys were already tapped, and which modifier keys are
currently pressed.  It is natural to consider the C<Shift> modifier specially: let’s
remove it from the context; now given a context, a keypress may produce two characters:
one with C<Shift>, one without.  A I<layer> describe such a pair of characters (or
prefixes) for every key of the keyboard.

So, the plain I<layer> is the part of keyboard layout accessible by using only 
non-prefix keys (possibly in combination with C<Shift>).  Many keyboard layouts
have up to 2 additional layers accessible without prefix keys: the C<AltGr>-layer and C<Control>-layer.  

On the simplest layouts, such as "US" or "Russian",  there is no prefix keys or “extra” 
modifier keys - 
but this is only feasible for languages which use very few characters with 
diacritic marks.  However, note that most layouts do not use 
C<Control>-layer - sometimes it is claimed that this causes problems with
system/application interaction.

A I<face> consists of the layers of the layout accessible with a particular
combination of prefix keys.  The I<primary face> consists of the plain layer 
and “additional prefix-less layers” of the layout;
it is the part of layout accessible without switching "sticky state" and 
without using prefix keys.  There may be up to 3 layers (Plain, C<AltGr>, C<rightControl>)
per face on the standard Windows keyboard layouts.  A I<secondary face> is a face exposed after pressing 
a prefix key (or a chain of prefix keys).

A I<personality> is a collection of faces: the primary face, plus one face per
a defined prefix-key (or a prefix chain).  Finally, a I<keyboard layout group> is a collection of personalities
(switchable by sticky keys [like C<CapsLock>] and/or in other system-specific ways)
designed to work smoothly together.  For example, in multi-script settings, there may be:

=over 4

=item *

one personality per script (e.g., Latin/Greek/Cyrillic/Arabic); 

=item *

every personality may have several script-specific additional (“satellite”) faces (one per a particular diacritic for Latin
personality, one for regional/historic “flavors” for Cyrillic personality, one per aspiration type for Greek personality, etc); 

=item *

every personality may also have “liason” faces accessing the base faces of other personalities;

=item *

with chained prefixes, it is easy to design intuitive ways to access satellite faces of other personalities;
then every personality will also contain the satellite faces of I<other> personalities (on different prefix chains!).

=item *

For access to “technical symbols” (currencies/math/IPA etc), the personalities may share a certain collection
of faces assigned to the same prefix keys.

=back

=head2 Example of keyboard layout groups

Start with a I<very> elaborate example (it is more or less a simplified variant
of the L<C<izKeys> layout|http://k.ilyaz.org>.  A keyboard layout group may consist of 
phonetically matched Latin and Cyrillic personalities, and visually matched Greek 
and Math personalities.  Several prefix-keys may be shared by all 4 of these 
personalities; in addition, there would be 4 prefix-keys allowing access to primary 
faces of these 4 personalities from other personalities of the group.  Also, there 
may be specialised prefix keys tuned for particular need of entering Latin script, 
Cyrillic script, Greek script, and Math.

Suppose that there are 8 specialized-for-Latin prefix-keys (for example, name them
   
  grave/tilde/hat/breve/ring_above/macron/acute/diaeresis

although in practice each one of them may do more than the name suggests).  
Then the Latin personality will have the following 13 faces:

   Primary/Latin-Primary/Cyrillic-Primary/Greek-Primary/Math-Primary
   grave/tilde/hat/breve/ring_above/macron/acute/diaeresis

B<NOTE:>   Here Latin-Primary is the face one gets when one presses
the Access-Latin prefix-key when in Latin mode; it may be convenient to define 
it to be the same as Primary - or maybe not.  For example, if one defines it 
to be Greek-Primary, then this prefix-key has a convenient semantic of flipping
between Latin and Greek modes for the next typed character: when in
Latin, C<Latin-PREFIX-KEY a> would enter α, when in Greek, the same keypresses
[now meaning "Latin-PREFIX-KEY α"] would enter "a".

Assume that the only “extra” modifier used by the layout is C<AltGr>.  Then each of 
these faces would consists of two layers: the plain one, and the C<AltGr>- 
one.  For example, pressing C<AltGr> with a key on Greek face could add
diaeresis to a vowel, or use a modified ("final" or "symbol") "glyph" for
a consonant (as in σ/ς θ/ϑ).  Or, on Latin face, C<AltGr-a> may produce æ.  Or, on a
Cyrillic personality, AltGr-я (ya) may produce ѣ (yat').

Likewise, the Greek personality may define special prefix-keys to access polytonic 
greek vowels.  “Chaining” these prefix keys after the C<Greek-Primary> prefix
key would make it possible to enter polytonic Greek letters from non-Greek
personalities without switching to the Greek personality.

With such a keyboard layout group, to type one Greek word in a Cyrillic text one 
would switch to the Greek personality, then back to Cyrillic; but when all one 
need to type now is only one Greek letter, it may be easier to use the 
"Greek-PREFIX-KEY letter" combination, and save switching back to the
Cyrillic personality.  (Of course, for this to work the letter should be 
on the primary face of the Greek personality.)

How to make it possible to easily enter a short Greek word when in Cyrillic mode?
If one uses one more “extra” modifier key (say, C<ApplicationMenu>), one could
reserve combinations of modifiers with this key to “use” other personality.  Say,
C<ApplicationMenu-b> would enter Greek β, C<AltGr-ApplicationMenu-b> would enter
Cyrillic б, etc.

=head2 “Onion rings” approach to keyboard layout groups

Looks too complicated?  Try to think about it in a different way: there
are many faces in a keyboard layout group; break them into 3 "onion rings":

=over 4

=item I<CORE> faces 

one can "switch to a such a face" and type continuously using 
this face without pressing prefix keys.  In other words, these faces 
can be made "active" (in an OS-dependent way).
     
When one CORE face is active, the letters in another CORE face are still 
accessible by pressing one particular prefix key before each of these
letters.  This prefix key does not depend on which core face is 
currently "active".

=item  I<Universally accessible> faces 

one cannot "switch to them", however, letters
in these faces are accessible by pressing one particular prefix key
before this letter.  This prefix key does not depend on which
core face is currently "active".

=item I<satellite> faces 

one cannot "switch to them", and letters in these faces
are accessible from one particular core face only.  One must press a 
prefix key before every letter in such faces.

(In presence of “chained prefixes”, the description is less direct:
these faces are much easier to access from one particular CORE face.
From another CORE face, one must preceed this prefix key by the
access-that-CORE-face prefix.)

=back

For example, when entering a mix of Latin/Cyrillic scripts and math,
it makes sense to make the base-Latin and base-Cyrillic faces into
the core; it is convenient when (several) Math faces and a Greek face 
can be made universally accessible.  On the other hand, faces containing
diacritized Latin letters and diacritized Cyrillic letters should better
be made satellite; this avoids a proliferation of prefix keys which would
make typing slower.

Comparing to the terms of the preceding section, the CORE faces correspond
to personalities.  A personality I<imports> the base face from other personalities;
it may also import satellite faces from other personalities.

In a personality, one should make access to satellite faces, the imported
CORE faces, and the universally accessible faces as simple as possible.
If “other” satellite faces are imported, the access to them may be more
cumbersome.

=head2 Large Latin layouts: on access to diacritic marks

Every prefix key has a numeric I<ID>.  On Windows, there are situations
when this numeric ID may be visible to the user.  (This module makes every
effort to make this happen as rarely as possible.  However, this effort
blows up the size of the layout DLL, and at some moment one may hit the
L<Windows’ limits for size of the layout DLL|"If data in KEYNAME_DEAD takes too much space, keyboard is mis-installed, and “Language Bar” goes crazy">.
To reduce the size of the DLL, the module makes a triage, and won’t protect the ID from leaking in some rare cases.)
When such a leak happens, what the user sees is the character with this codepoint.
So it makes sense to choose the ID to be the codepoint of a character “related
to what the prefix key ‘does’”.

The logic: if the prefix keys add some diacritic, the ID should be the 
I<primary non-ASCII spacing modifier letter> related to this diacritic: either
C<Latin-1>’s 8-bit characters with high bit set, or
if none with the needed glyph, suitable non-Latin-1 "spacing modifier letters" or
"spacing clones of diacritics".

If followed by “special keys”, one should be able to access other related 
modifier letters and combining characters (see L<"Classification of diacritics">
and the section C<Diacritics> in L<the example
layout|http://search.cpan.org/~ilyaz/UI-KeyboardLayout/examples/izKeys.kbdd>);
one possible convenient choice is:

=over 4

=item The second press of the prefix key

The principal combining mark;

=item SPACE

The primary non-ASCII spacing modifier letter;

=item SPACE-related (NBSP, or C<Shift-SPACE>, or C<AltGr-SPACE>)

The secondary/ternary/etc modifier letter;

=item digits (possibly with C<Shift> and/or C<AltGr>)

related combining marks (with C<Shift> and/or C<AltGr>, other categories
from L<"Classification of diacritics">).

=item C<'> or C<"> (possibly with C<AltGr>)

secondary/ternary/etc combining marks (or, if these are on 
digits, replace by prime-shape modifier chars).

=back

=head2 The choice of prefix keys

Some stats on prefix keys: C<ISO 9995-3> uses 41 prefix keys for diacritics (but 15 are fake, see below!);
L<Apple’s C<US Extended> uses 24|http://www.macfreek.nl/memory/Mac_Keyboard_Layout> (not counting prefix №, action=specials
on L<the code for this layout|https://raw.github.com/lreddie/ukelele-steps/master/USExtended.keylayout>:

   "'@2#3%5^67*8AaCcEeGghHjJ   KkMmNnQqRrsUuvwWYyZz‘’“  default=terminator
  №ʺʹƧƨƐɛƼƽƄƅ⁊ȢȣƏəƆɔƎǝƔɣƕǶƞȠ  K’ĸƜɯŊŋƢƣƦʀſƱʊʌƿǷȜȝƷʒʻʼʽ  №

); bépo uses 20, while EurKey uses 8, and L<Apple’s C<US> uses 5|http://www.macfreek.nl/memory/Mac_Keyboard_Layout>.  
On the other end of spectrum, there are 10 US keyboard keys with "calculatable" relation to Latin diacritics:

  `~^-'",./? --- grave/tilde/hat/macron/acute/diaeresis/cedilla/dot/stroke/hook-above

To this list one may add a "calculatable" key C<$> as I<the currency prefix>;
on the other hand, one should probably remove C<?> since C<AltGr-?> should better
be "set in stone" to denote C<¿>.  If one adds Greek, then the calculatable positions
for aspiration are on C<[ ]> (or on C<( )>).  Of widely used Latin diacritics, this
leaves out I<ring/hacek/breve/horn/ogonek/comma> (and doubled I<grave/acute>);
these diacretics should be either “mixed in” with similar "calculatable" diacritics
(for example, <AltGr-,> may either create a character with cedilla, or with
ogonek — depending on the character), or should be assigned on less intuitive positions.

Extra prefix keys of L<C<ISO 9995-3>|http://www.pentzlin.com/info2-9995-3-V3.pdf>: 
I<breve↓/circumflex↓/comma↑/dot↓/↺breve/long-solidus/low-line/macron↓/short-stroke/vertical-line↑↓>.
Additionally, the following diacritics produce only 4 precomposed characters: ṲṳḀḁ, so their use as prefix characters is questionable:
I<candrabindu/comma↗↓/diaeresis↓/²breve(↓)/²↺breve/²macron(↓)/²tilde/²vertical-line↑↓/=↓/hook↑/ring↓>
(Here ↓ is a shortcut for C<below>, same with ↑ for C<above>, and ↗ for C<above right>; ↺ means C<inverted>, and ² means C<double>.
Combined arrows expand to multiple diacritics.)

(Keep in mind that this list is just a conjecture; the standard does not distinguish combining characters
and prefix keys, so it is not clear which keypresses produce combining characters, and which are prefix keys.)

=head2 On principles of intuitive design of Latin keyboard

Using tricks described below, it is easy to create a convenient map of vowels
with 3 diacritics `¨´ to the QWERTY keyboad.  However, some common
(meaning: from Latin-1–10 of ISO 8859) letters from Latin alphabet 
cannot be composed this way; they are  B<ÆÐÞÇĲØŒß>
(one may need to add B<ªº>, as well as B<¡¿> for non-alphabetical symbols). It is crucial 
that these letters may be entered by an intuitively clear key of the keyboard.
There is an obvious ASCII letter associated to each of these (e.g., B<T> associated to the thorn
B<Þ>), and in the best world just pressing this letter with C<AltGr>-modifier
would produce the desired symbol.

  Note that ª may be associated to @; then º may be mapped to the nearby 2.

There is only one conflict: both B<Ø>,B<Œ> "want" to be entered as C<AltGr-O>;
this is the ONLY piece of arbitrariness in the design so far.  After
resolving this conflict, C<AltGr>-keys B<!2ASDCTIO?> are assigned their meanings,
and cannot carry other letters (call them the “stuck in stone keys”).

(Other keys "stuck in stone" are dead keys: it is important to have the
glyph etched on these keyboard's keys similar to the task they perform.)

Then there are several non-alphabetical symbols accessible through ISO 8859
encodings.  Assigning them C<AltGr>- access is another important task to perform.
Some of these symbols come in pairs, such as ≤≥, «», ‹›, “”, ‘’; it makes
sense to assign them to paired keyboard's keys: <> or [] or ().

However, this task is in conflict of interests with yet another (!) task, so
let us explain the needs answered by that task first.

One can always enter accented letters using dead keys; but many people desire a
quickier way to access them, by just pressing AltGr-key (possibly with
shift).  The most primitive keyboard designs (such as IBM International
or Apple’s US (Extended)

   http://www.borgendale.com/uls.htm
   http://www.macfreek.nl/memory/Mac_Keyboard_Layout

) omit this step and assign only the NECESSARY letters for AltGr- access.
(Others, like MicroSoft International, assign only a very small set.)

This problem breaks into two tasks, choosing a repertoir of letters which
will be typable this way, and map them to the keys of the keyboard.
For example, EurKey choses to use ´¨`-accented characters B<AEUIO> (except

=head2 Our solution

First, the answer (the alternative, illustrated description is on
L<the visual maps list|http://k.ilyaz.org/windows/izKeys-visual-maps.html#altgr-latin>):

=over 10

=item Rule 0:

non-ASCII letters which are not accented by B<` ´ ¨ ˜ ˆ ˇ ° ¯ ⁄> are entered by
C<AltGr>-keys "obviously associated" to them.  Supported: B<ÆÐÞÇĲŒß>.
 
=item Rule 0a: 

Same is applicable to B<Ê> and B<Ñ>.

=item Rule 1:

Vowels B<AEYUIO> accented by B<¨´`> are assigned the so called I<"natural position">:
3 “alphabetic” rows of keyboard are allocated to accents (B<¨> is the top, B<´> is the middle, B<`> is
the bottom row of 3 alphabetic-rows on keyboard - so B<À> is on B<ZXCV>-row),
and are on the same diagonal as the base letter.  For left-hand
vowels (B<A>,B<E>) the diagonal is in the direction of \, for right hand
voweles (B<Y>,B<U>,B<I>,B<O>) - in the direction of /.

=item Rule 1a: 

If the "natural position" is occupied, the neighbor key in the
direction of "the other diagonal" is chosen.  (So for B<A>,B<E> it is
the /-diagonal, and for right-hand vowels B<YUIO> it is the \-diag.)

=item Rule 1b: 

This neighbor key is below unless the key is on bottom row - then it is above.

Supported by rules "1": all but B<ÏËỲ>.

=item Rule 2:  

Additionally, B<Å>,B<Ø>,B<Ì> are available on keys B<R>,B<P>,B<V>.
B<ª> is on B<@>, and B<º> is on the nearby B<2>.

=back

=head2 Clarification:

B<0.> If you remember only Rule 0, you still can enter all Latin-1 letter using
Rule 0; all you need to remember that most of the dead keys are at “obvious”
positions: for L<C<izKeys>|http://k.ilyaz.org> it is B<`';"~^.,-/> for B<`´¨¨˜ˆ°¸¯ ̸>
(B<¨> is repeated on B<;">!) and B<6> for B<ˇ> (memorizable as “opposite” of B<^> for B<ˆ>).
   
  (What the rule 0 actually says is: "You do not need to memorize me". ;-)

(If you need a diacritic which is only I<similar> to one of the listed diacritics,
there is a good chance that the dead key above L<will do what you need|"On possibilities of merging 2 diacritics on one prefix key">.)
   
B<1.> If all you remember are rules 1,1a, you can calculate the position of the
AltGr-key for AEYUIO accented by `´¨ up to a choice of 3 keys (the "natural
key" and its 2 neighbors) - which are quick to try all if you forgot the
precise position.  If you remember rules 1,1ab, then this choice is down to
2 possible candidates.

Essentially, all you must remember in details is that the "natural positions"
form a B<V-shape> — \ on left, / on right, and in case of bad luck you
should move in the direction of other diagonal one step.  Then a letter is
either in its "obvious position", or in one of 3 modifications of the
“natural position”.

Note that these rules cover I<ALL> the Latin letters appearing in
Latin-1..Latin-10, I<provided> we resolve the B<Œ/Ø>-conflict by putting B<Œ> to the key B<O> (since
B<Ø> may be entered using C<AltGr->B</ O>)!

=head2 Motivations:

It is important to have a logical way to quickly understand whether a letter
is quickly accessible from a keyboard, and on which key.  (Or, maybe, to find
a small set of keys on which a letter may be present — then, if one forgets,
it is possible to quickly un-forget by trying a small number of keys).

In fact, the problem of choosing “the optimal” assignment (by minimizing the
rules to remember) has almost unique solution.  Understanding this solution
(to a problem which is essentially combinatorial optimization) may be a great help
in memorizing the rules.

The idea: we assign alphabetical Latin characters only to alphabetical keys
on the keyboard; this frees the way to use (paired) symbol keys to enter (paired)
Unicode symbols.  Now observe the diagonals on the alphabetic part of the
keyboard: \-diagonals (like B<EDC>) and /-diagonals (like B<UHB>).  Each diagonal
contains 3 (or less) alphabetic keys; what we want is to assign ¨-accent to the top
one, ´-accent to the middle one, and `-accent to the bottom one.

On the left-hand part of the keyboard, use \-diagonals, on the right-hand
part use /-diagonals; now each diagonal contains EXACTLY 3 alphabetic keys.
Moreover, the diagonals which contain vowels B<AEYUIO> do not intersect!

If we have not decided to have keys set in stone, this would be all - we
would get "completely predictable" access to B<´¨`>-accented characters B<AEUIO>.
For example, B<Ÿ> would be accessible on C<AltGr->B<Y>, B<Ý> on C<AltGr->B<G>, B<Ỳ> on C<AltGr->B<V>.
Unfortunately, the diagonals contain keys C<ASDCIO> set in stone.  So we need
a way to "move away" from these keys.  The rule is very simple: we move
one step away in the direction of "other" diagonal (/-diagonal on the left
half, and \-diagonal on the right half) one step down (unless we start
on keys B<A>, B<C> where "down" is impossible and we move up to B<W> or B<F>).

Examples: B<Ä> is on B<Q>, B<Á> "wants to be" on B<A> (used for C<Æ>), so it is moved to
C<W>; B<Ö> wants to be on B<O> (already used for B<Ø> or B<Œ>), and is moved away to B<L>;
B<È> wants to be on B<C> (occupied by B<Ç>), but is moved away to B<F>.

There is no way to enter B<Ï> using this layout (unless we agree to move it
to the "8*" key, which may conflict with convenience of entering typographic
quotation marks).  Fortunately, this letter is rare (comparing even to B<Ë>
which is quite frequent in Dutch).  So there is no big deal that it is not
available for "handy" input - remember that one can always use deadkeys.

 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_frequency#Relative_frequencies_of_letters_in_other_languages

Note that the keys B<P> and B<R> are not engaged by this layout; since B<P>
is a neighbor of B<O>, it is natural to use it to resolve the conflict
between B<Ø> or B<Œ> (which both want to be set in stone on B<O>).  This leaves
only the key B<R> unengaged; but what we do not cover are two keys B<Å> and B<Ñ>
which are relatively frequent in Latin-derived European languages.

Note that B<Ì> is moderately frequent in Italian, but B<Ñ> is much more frequent
in Spanish.  Since B<Ì> and B<Ñ> want to be on the same key (which on many keyboards is taken by
B<Ñ>), it makes sense to prefer B<Ñ>…  Likewise, B<Ê> is much more frequent
than B<Ë>; switch them.

This leaves only the key B<R> unassigned, I<AND> a very rare B<Ỳ> on B<B>.  In
L<C<izKeys>|http://k.ilyaz.org>, one puts B<Å> and B<Ì> there.  This completes
the explanation of the rule 2.

=head2 On possibilities of merging 2 diacritics on one prefix key

With many diacritics, and the limited mnemonically-viable positions on
the keyboard, it makes sense to merge several diacritics on the same prefix key.
Possible candidates are cedilla/ogonek/comma-below (on C<AltGr-,>),
dot-above/ring-above/dot-below (on C<AltGr-.>), caron/breve, circumflex/inverted-breve (on C<AltGr-^).
In some cases, only one of the diacretics would be applicable to a particular character.
Otherwise, one must decide which of several choices to prefer.  The notes below may be
useful when designing such preferences.  (This module can take most of such choices
automatically due to knowledge of L<Unicode ages|http://www.unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/DerivedAge.txt> 
of characters; this age correlates well with expected frequency of use.)

Another trick discussed below is implementing a rare diacritic X by applying the diacretic Y to a character
with pre-composed diacritic Z.

U-caron: ǔ, Ǔ which is used to indicate u in the third tone of Chinese language pinyin.
But U-breve ŭ/Ŭ is used in Latin encodings.
Ǧ/ǧ (G with caron) is used, but only in "exotic" or old languages (has no
combined form - while G-breve ğ/Ğ is in Latin encodings.
A-breve Ă: A-caron Ǎ is not in Latin-N; apparently, is used only in pinyin,
zarma, Hokkien, vietnamese, IPA, transliteration of Old Latin, Bible and Cyrillic's big yus.

In EurKey: only a takes breve, the rest take caron (including G but not U)

Merging ° and dot-accent ˙ in Latin-N: only A and U take °, and they
do not take dot-accent.  In EurKey: also small w,y take ring accent; same in
Bepo - but they do not take dot accent in Latin-N.

Double-´ and cornu (both on a,u only) can be taken by ¨ or ˙ on letters with
¨ precombined (in Unicode ¨ is not precombined with diaeresis or dots).
But one must special-case Ë and Ï and Ø (have Ê and Ĳ instead; Ĳ takes no accents,
but Ê takes acute, grave, tilde and dot below...)!  Æ takes acute and macron; Ø takes acute.

Actually, cornu=horn is only on o,u, so using dot/ring on ö and ü is very viable...

So for using AltGr-letter after deadkeys: diaeresis can take dot above, hat and wedge, diaeresis.
Likewise, ` and ´ are not precombined together (but there is a combined
combining mark).  So one can do something else on vowels (ogonek?).

Applying ´ to `-accented forms: we do not have ỳ (on AltGr-keys), so must use "the natural position"
which is mixed with Ñ (takes no accents) and Ç (takes acute!!!).

s, t do not precombine with `; so can use for the "alternative cedilla".

Only a/u/w/y take ring, and they do not take cedilla.  Can merge.

Bepo's hook above; ảɓƈɗẻểƒɠɦỉƙɱỏƥʠʂɚƭủʋⱳƴỷȥ ẢƁƇƊẺỂƑƓỈƘⱮỎƤƬỦƲⱲƳỶȤ

  perl -wlnae "next unless /HOOK/; push @F, shift @F; print qq(@F)" NamesList.txt | sort | less

Of capital letters only T and Y take different kinds of hooks... (And for T both are in Latin-Extended-B...)

=head1 Keyboard input on Windows: interaction of applications and the kernel

=head2 Keyboard input on Windows, Part I: what is the kernel doing?

This is not documented.  We try to provide a description which is
both as simple as possible, and as complete as possible.  (We ignore
many important parts: the handling of hot keys [or C<C-A-Del>]), IME,
handling of focus switch [C<Alt-Tab> etc], the syncronization of keystate
between different queues, waking up the system, the keyboard filters,
widening of virtual keycodes, and LED lights.)

We omit Step 0, when the hardware keyboard drivers (PS/2 or USB) deliver keydown/up(/repeat???) event for scan
codes of corresponding keys.  (This is a complicated topic, but well-documented.)

=over

=item 1

The scan codes are massaged (see “Low level scancode mapping” in L<"SEE ALSO">).

=item 2

The keyboard layout tables map the translated scancode to a virtual keycode.
(This may also depend on the “modification column”; see L<"Far Eastern keyboards on Windows">.)
The “internal” key state table is updated.

=item 3

Mythology: the modification keys (C<Shift>, C<Alt>, C<Ctrl> etc) are taken into account.

What actually happens: any key may act as a modification key.  The keyboard layout tables
map keycodes to 8-bit masks.  (The customary names for lower bits of the mask are C<KBDSHIFT>,
C<KBDCTRL>, C<KBDALT>, C<KBDKANA>; two more bits are named C<KBDROYA> and C<KBDLOYA> — after
OYAYUBI 親指, meaning THUMB; two more
bits are unnamed.)  The keycodes of the currently pressed keys (from the “internal” table) are translated to masks, and
these masks are ORed together.  (For the purpose of translation to C<WM_CHAR>/etc [done
in ToUnicode()/ToUnicodeEx()], the bit C<KBDKANA> may be set
also when key C<VK_KANA> was pressed odd number of times; this is
controlled by C<KANALOK> flag in a virtual key descriptor [of the key being currently processed]
of the keyboard layout tables.)

The keyboard layout tables translate the ORed mask to a number called “modification column”.
(Thess two numbers are completely hidden from applications.  The only glint the
applications get is in the [useless, since there is no way to map it to anything “real”] result of
L<VkKeyScanEx()|http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms646332%28v=vs.85%29.aspx>.])

=item 4

Depending on the current “modification column”, the virtual keycode of the current key event
may be massaged further.  (See L<"Far Eastern keyboards on Windows">.)  Numpad keycodes
depend also on the state of C<NumLock> — provided the keyboard layout table marks them with
C<KBDNUMPAD> flag.  A few other scancodes may also produce different virtual keycodes in
different situations (e.g., C<Break>).

When C<KLLF_ALTGR> flag is present, fake presses/releases of left C<Ctrl> are generated
on presses(repeats)/releases of right C<Alt> (exception: the press is not generated if any
Ctrl key is down; likewise for when left C<Ctrl> up when right C<Alt> is released).  With
keypad presses/releases in presence of C<VK_SHIFT> and C<NumLock>, fake releases/presses of C<VK_SHIFT>
are generated.

=item 5

If needed, asyncroneous key state for the current key's non-left-non-right flavor is updated.
(The rest is dropped if the key is consumed by a C<WH_KEYBOARD_LL> hook.)

Asyncroneous key state for the current key is updated.  Numpad-by-number flags are updated.
(The rest is dropped if the key is a hotkey.)

The message C<WM_(SYS)KEYDOWN/UP> is posted to the application.  If C<VK_MENU> [usually
called the C<Alt> key] is
down, but C<VK_CONTROL> is not, the event is of C<SYS> flavor (this info is duplicated in
lParam.  Additionally, for C<VK_MENU> tapping, the UP event is also made C<SYS> — although
at this moment C<VK_MENU> is not down!).
(The C<KBDEXT> flag [of the scancode] is also delivered to the application.)

(When a C<WM_(SYS)KEYDOWN/UP> message is posted, the key state is updated.  This key state
may be used by TranslateMessage() as an argument to ToUnicode(), and is returned by GetKeyState() etc.)

B<The following steps are applicable only if the application uses “the standard message pump”
with TranslateMessage()/DispatchMessage() or uses some equivalent code.>

=item 6

Before the application dispatches C<WM_(SYS)KEYDOWN/UP> to the message handler,
TranslateMessage() calls L<ToUnicode()|The semantic of ToUnicode()> with C<wFlags = 0> (unless a popup menu
is active; then C<wFlags = 1> — which disables character-by-number input via
numeric KeyPad) and the buffer of 16 UTF-16 code units.

=item 7

The UTF-16 code units obtained from ToUnicode() are posted via PostMessage().  All the code units but
the last one are marked by C<FAKE_KEYSTROKE> flag in C<lParam>.  If the initial message
was C<WM_SYSKEYDOWN>, the C<SYS> flavor is posted; if ToUnicode() returns a
deadkey, the C<DEAD> flavor is posted.

(The bit C<ALTNUMPAD_BIT> is set/used only for the console handler.)

=back

=head2 Keyboard input on Windows, Part II: The semantic of ToUnicode()

L<The syntax of ToUnicode() is documented|http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms646320%28v=vs.85%29.aspx>,
the semantic is not.  Here we fix this.

=over 4

=item 1

If the bit 0x01 in C<wFlags> is not set, the key event is checked for contributing to
character-by-number input via numeric KeyPad (and numpad-by-number flags are updated).
If so, the character is
delivered only when C<Alt> is released.  (This the only case when KEYUP
delivers a character.)  Unless the bit 0x02 in C<wFlags> is set, the KEYUP
events are not processed any more.

=item 2

The flag C<KLLF_LRM_RLM> is acted upon, and C<VK_PACKET> is processed.

=item 3

The keys which are currently down are mapped to the ORed bitmap (see above).

=item 4

If the key event does not contribute to input-by-number via numeric keypad,
and C<KBDALT> is set, and no other bits except C<KBDSHIFT>, C<KBDKANA> are set:
then the bit C<KBDALT> is removed from the ORed mask.

=item 5

If C<CapLock> is active, C<KBDSHIFT> state is flipped in the following cases: either at most
C<KBDSHIFT> is set in the bitmap, and C<CAPLOK> is set in the descriptor,
or both C<KBDALT> and C<KBDCTRL> are set in the bitmap, and C<CAPLOKALTGR> is set in the
descriptor.

Now the ORed bitmap is converted to the modification column (see above).

=item 6

The key descriptor for the current virtual keycode is consulted (the “row” of the table).
If C<SGCAPS> flag is on, C<CapsLock> is active, and no other bits but C<KBDSHIFT> are set in the bitmap,
the row is replaced by the next row.

=item 7

The entry at 
the row/column is extracted; if defined, it is either a string (zero or more UTF-16 code units), or a
dead key ID (one UTF-16 unit).  (I<Implementation>: the ID is taken from the next row of the table.)

(If the ORed mask corresponds to a valid modification column, but the row does not
define the behaviour at this column, and the bit C<KBDCTRL> is set, and no other bits but C<KBDSHIFT>, C<KBDKANA>
are set, then an autogenerated character in the range 0x00..0x1f is emitted for virtual keycodes
'A'..'Z' and widened virtual keycodes 0xFF61..0xFF91 [for latter, based on the low bits of translation-to-scancode]).

=item 8

The resulting units are fed to the finite automaton.  When the automaton is in
0-state, a fed character unit is passed through, and a fed deadkey ID sets the state
of the automaton to this number.  In non-0 state, the IDs behave the
same as numerically equal character units; the behaviour is described by the keyboard layout
tables.  The automaton changes the state according to the input; it may also emit a character
(= 1 code unit; then it is always reset to 0 state).  When “unrecognized input” arrives, the automaton
emits the ID I<and> the input, and resets to 0 state.

(On KEYUP event, the changes to the state of the finite-automaton are ignored.  This is only
relevant if C<wFlags> has bit 0x02 set.)

=item 9

After UTF-16 units are passed through the automaton, its output is returned by ToUnicode().
If the automaton is in non-0 state, the state ID becomes the output.

=back

B<NOTE:> MSKLC restricts the length of the string associated to the row/column cell to
be at most 4 UTF-16 code units.  There are 2 restrictions for keyboard layouts created with other tools:
first, the maximal number of UTF-16 codepoints in all these strings is stored in a byte, hence there
may be at most 255 UTF-16 codepoints.  Second, the actual slot C<KBDTABLES.cbLgEntry> where the string is allocated
contains two shorts, then the UTF-16 data; its length is also stored in a byte.  This results in
the maximal string length of 125 code units — if it is stored in one slot.

However, with creative allocations, one can use more than one slot for a string storage
(theoretically, one may imagine specially crafted layout where this would break the
layout; on practice, such situations should not arise — even if one stores long strings in
I<many> slots good for 4-chars strings.

B<NOTE:> If the application uses the stardard message pump
with TranslateMessage()/DispatchMessage(), the caller of ToUnicode() is TranslateMessage().
In this case, ToUnicode() is called with an output buffer consisting of 16 UTF-16 code units.  For
such applications, the strings associated to keypresses are truncated after 16 code units.

B<NOTE:> If the string is “long” (i.e., defined via LIGATURES), when it is fed through the
finite automaton, the transitions to non-0 state do not generate deadkey IDs in the output
string.  (The LIGATURES may contain strings of one code unit!  This may lead to non-obvious
behaviour!  If pressing such a key after a deadkey generates a chained deadkey, this
would happen without delivering C<WM_DEADKEY> message.)

B<NOTE:> How kernel recognizes which key sequences contribute to
character-by-number input via numeric KeyPad?  First, the starter keydown must happen
when the ORed mask contains C<KBDALT>, and no other bits except C<KBDSHIFT>
and C<KBDKANA>.  (E.g., one can press C<Alt>, then tap C<f 1 2 3>, release C<Alt>
[with 1,2,3 on the numeric keypad].
This would deliver C<Alt-f>, then C<1> would start character-by-number input
provided C<Alt> and C<NumPad1> together have ORed mask “in between” of C<KBDALT>
and C<KBDALT|KBDSHIFT|KBDKANA>.)

After the starter keydown (NumPad: 0..9, DOT, PLUS) is recognized as such, all the keydowns
should be followed by the corresponding keyup (keydowns-due-to-repeat are ignored);
more precisely, between two KEYDOWN events, the KEYUP for the first of them must be present.
(In other words, KEYDOWN/KEYUP events must come in the expected order, maybe with some intermixed “extra” KEYUP events.)
In the decimal mode (numeric starter) only the keys with scancodes of NumPad 0..9 are allowed.
In the hex mode (starter is NumPad's DOT or PLUS) also the keys with virtual codes
'0'..'9' and 'A'..'F' are allowed.  The sequence is terminated by releasing C<VK_MENU>
(=C<Alt>) key.

B<NOTE:> In most cases, the resulting number is reduced mod 256.  The exceptions are: the starter key is C<KeyPadPLUS>, 
or the translate-to codepage is multibyte (then a number above 255 is interpreted as big-endian combination
of bytes).  In multibyte codepages, numbers 0x80..0xFF
are considered in C<cp1252> codepage (unless the translate-to codepage is Japanese, and the number’s codepoint is Katakana).

B<NOTE:> If the starter key is C<KeyPad0> or C<KeyPadDOT>, the number is a codepoint in the default codepage of the keyboard layout;
if it is another digit, it is in the OEM codepage.
Enabling hex modes (C<KeyPadPLUS> or C<KeyPadDOT>) requires extra tinkering; see L<"Hex input of unicode is not enabled">.

B<NOTE:> since keyboard layout normally map C<Alt> to the mask C<KBDALT>, and do not define
a modification column for the ORed mask C<=KBDALT>, and C<KBDALT> is B<NOT> stripped for
key events in input-by-number, these key events usually do not generate spurious C<WM_CHAR>s.

B<NOTE:> if the bit 0x01 of C<wFlags> is intended to be set, then there is a way to query
the kernel “what would happen if a particular key with a particular combination of modifiers
were pressed now”.  (Recall that a “usual” ToUnicode() call is “destructive”: it modifies the
I<state> of the keyboard stored in the kernel.  The information about whether one is in the
middle of entering-by-number and/or whether one is in a middle of a deadkey sequence is
erased or modified by such calls.)  In general, there is no way preserve the state of
entering-by-number; however, in presence of bit 0x01, this is of no concern, so a solution
exists.

Using C<wFlags=0x01|0x02>, and setting the high bit of C<wScanCode> gives the same result as
ToUnicode() with C<wFlags=0x01> and no high bit in C<wScanCode>.  Moreover, this preserves the state of
the deadkey-finite-automaton.  This way, one gets a “I<nondestrictive>” flavor of ToUnicode().

=head2 Keyboard input on Windows, Part III: Customary “special” keybindings of typical keyboards

Typically, keyboards define a few keypresses which deliver “control” characters
(for benefits of console applications).  As shown above, even if the keyboard does not
define C<Control-letter> combinations (but does define modification column for C<Ctrl>
which is associated to C<KBDCTRL> — with maybe C<KBDSHIFT>, C<KBDKANA> intermixed), C<WM_CHAR>
with C<^letter> I<will> be delivered to the application.  Same with happen for combinations
with modifiers which produce only C<KBDCTRL>, C<KBDSHIFT>, C<KBDKANA>.

Additionally, the typical keyboards also define the following bindings:

  Ctrl-Space	 ——→ 0x20
  Esc, Ctrl-[	 ——→ 0x1b
  Ctrl-]	 ——→ 0x1d
  Ctrl-\	 ——→ 0x1c
  BackSpace	 ——→ ^H
  Ctrl-BackSpace ——→ 0x7f
  Ctrl-Break	 ——→ ^C
  Tab		 ——→ ^I
  Enter		 ——→ ^M
  Ctrl-Enter	 ——→ ^J

In addition to this, the standard US keyboard (and keyboards built by this Perl module) define
the following bindings with C<Ctrl-Shift> modifiers:

  @	 ——→ 0x00
  ^	 ——→ 0x1e
  _	 ——→ 0x1f

=head2 Can an application on Windows accept keyboard events?  Part I: insert only

The logic described above makes the kernel deliver more or less “correct” C<WM_(SYS)CHAR> messages
to the application.  The only bindings which may be defined in the keyboard layout, but will not be
seen as C<WM_(SYS)CHAR> are those in modification columns which involve C<KBDALT>, and do not
involve any bits except C<KBDSHIFT> and C<KBDKANA>.  (Due to the stripping of C<KBDALT> described
above, these modification columns are never accessed — I<well, they are, but only for input-by-number>.)

Try to design an application with an entry field; the application should insert B<ALL> the
characters ”delivered for insertion” by the keyboard layout and the kernel.  The application
should not do anything else for all the other keyboard events.  First, ignore
the C<KBDALT> stripping.

Then the only C<WM_(SYS)CHAR> which are NOT supposed to insert the contents to the editable UI fields are the
L<Customary “special” keybindings> described above.  They are easy to recognize and ignore: just
ignore all the C<WM_(SYS)CHAR> carrying characters in the range C<0x00..0x1f>, C<0x7f>, and ignore C<0x20>
delivered when one of C<Ctrl> keys is down.  So the application which inserts all the I<other>
C<WM_(SYS)CHAR>s will follow I<the intent> of the keyboard as close as possible.

Now return to consideration of C<KBDALT> stripping.  If the application follows the policy above,
pressing C<Alt-b> would enter C<b> — provided C<Alt> is mapped to C<KBDALT>, as done
on standard keyboards.  So the application should recognize which C<WM_CHAR> carrying C<b>
are actually due to stripping of C<KBDALT>, and should not insert the delivered characters.

Here comes the major flaw of the Windows’ keyboard subsystem: the kernel translates
SCANCODE —→ VK_CODE —→ ORED_MASK —→ MODIFICATION_COLUMN, then operates in terms of
ORed masks and modification columns.  The application can access only the first two levels
of this translation; one cannot query the kernel for any information about the last
two numbers.  (Except for the API L<VkKeyScanEx()|http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms646332%28v=vs.85%29.aspx>,
but it is unclear how this API may help: it translates “in wrong direction” and covers only BMP.)
Therefore, there is no bullet-proof way to recognize when C<WM_(SYS)CHAR> arrived
due to C<KBDALT> stripping.

B<NOTE:> of course, if only C<Shift/Alt/Ctrl> keys are associated to non-0 ORed mask bitmaps,
and they are associated to the “expected” C<KBDSHIFT/KBDALT/KBDCTRL> bits, then the
application would easily recognize this situation by checking whether C<Alt> is down,
but C<Ctrl> is not.  (Also observe that this is exactly the situation distinguishing
C<WM_CHAR> from C<WM_SYSCHAR> — no surprises here!)

Assuming that the application uses this method, it would correctly recognize stripped
events on the “primitive” keyboards.  However, on a keyboard with an extra modifier
key (call it C<Super>; assume its mask involves a non-SHIFT/ALT/CTRL/KANA bit),
the C<Alt-Super-key> combination will not be stripped by the kernel, but the application
would think that it was, and would not insert the character in C<WM_CHAR> message.  A bug!

Moreover, if “supporing only the naive mapping” were a feasible
restriction, there would be no reason for the kernel to go through the extra step of “the ORed mask”.
Actually, to have a keyboard which is simultaneously backward compatible, easy for users, and
covering a sufficiently wide range of possible characters, one B<must> use more or
less convoluted implementations (as in L<A convenient assignment of C<KBD*> bitmaps to modifier keys>).

B<CONCLUSION:> the fact that the kernel and the applications speak different
incompatible languages makes even the primitive task discussed here impossible
to code in a bullet-proof way.  A heuristic workaround exists, but it will not
work with all keyboards and all combinations of modifiers.

B<CAVEAT with the above assignment:> some applications (e.g., Emacs) manage to distinguish
C<lCtrl+lAlt> combination of modifier keys from the combination C<lCtrl+rAlt> produced by 
a typical C<AltGr>; these applications are able to use C<lCtrl+lAlt>-modified 
keys as a bindable accelerator keys.  We address this question in the L<Part IV|"Can an application on Windows accept keyboard events?  Part IV: application-specific modifiers">.

=head2 Can an application on Windows accept keyboard events?  Part II: special key events

In the preceding section, we considered the most primitive application accepting
the user inserting of characters, and nothing more.  “Real applications” must
support also keyboard actions different from “insertion”; so those KEYDOWN events
which are not related to insertion may trigger some “special actions”.  To model a full-featured
keyboard input, consider the following specification:

As above, the application has an entry field, and should insert B<ALL> the
characters ”delivered for insertion” by the keyboard layout and the kernel.
For all the keyboard events I<not related to insertion of characters>, the application
should write to the log file which of C<Ctrl/Alt/Shift> modifiers were down,
and the virtual keycode of the KEYDOWN event.  Again, at first, we ignore
the C<KBDALT> stripping.

At first, the problem looks simple: with the standard message pump, when C<WM_(SYS)KEYDOWN>
message is processed, the corresponding C<WM_(SYS)(DEAD)CHAR> messages are already
sent to the message queue.  One can PeekMessage() for these messages; if present,
and not “special”, they correspond to “insertion”, so nothing should be written to the log.
Otherwise, one reports this C<WM_(SYS)KEYDOWN> to the log.

Unfortunately, this solution is wrong.  Inspect again what the kernel is delivering
during the input-by-number via numeric keyboard: the KEYDOWN for decimal/hex digits
B<is> a part of the “insertion”, but it does not generate any C<WM_(SYS)(DEAD)CHAR>.
Essentially, the application may see C<Alt-F> pressed during the processing of
C<Alt-NumPadPlus+F+1+2>, but even if C<Alt-F> is supposed to format the paragraph,
this action should not be triggered (but C<U+0F12> should be eventually inserted).

B<CONCLUSION:> Input-by-number is getting in the way of using the standard message
pump.  C<SOLUTION>: one should write a clone of TranslateMessage() which delivers
suitable C<WM_USER*> messages for KEYDOWN/KEYUP involved in Input-by-number.  Doing
this, one can also remove sillyness from the Windows’ handling of Input-by-number
(such as taking C<mod 256> for numbers above 255).

B<POSSIBLE IMPLEMENTATION>: myTranslateMessage() should:

=over 4

=item *

when non handling input-by-number, call ToUnicode(), but use C<wFlag=1>, so that ToUnicode() does not handle input-by-number.

=item *

Recognize input-by-number starters by the scancode/virtual-keycode, the presence of C<VK_MENU> down, and
the fact that ToUnicode() produces nothing or C<'0'..'9','.',',','+'>.

=item *

After the starter, allow continuation by checking the scancode/virtual-keycode and the presence of C<VK_MENU> down.
Do not call ToUnicode() for continuation keydown/up events.

=item *

After a chain of continuations followed by KEYUP for C<VK_MENU>, one should PostMessage() for C<WM_(UNI)CHAR> with
accumulated input.

=back

Combining this with the heuristical recognition of stripped C<KBDALT>, one gets an architecture
with a naive approximation to handling of C<Alt> (but still miles ahead of all the applications
I saw!), and bullet-proof handling of other combinations of modifiers.

B<NOTE:> this implementation of MyTranslateMessage() loses one “feature” of the original one:
that input-by-number is disabled in the presence of (popup) menu.  However, since I never saw
this “feature” in action (and never have heard of it described anywhere), this must be of
negligible price.

B<NOTE:> I<ALL> the applications I checked do this logic wrong.  Most of them check B<FIRST> for
“whether the key event looks like those which should trigger special actions”, then perform
these special actions (and ignore the character payload).

As shown above, the reasonable way is to do this in the opposite order, and check for 
special actions only I<AFTER> it is known that the key event does not carry a character payload.
The impossibility of reversing the order of these checks is due to the same reason as one discussed
above: the
kernel and application speaking different languages.

Indeed, since the application knows nothing
about ORed masks, it has no way to distinguish that, for example, C<lCtrl-rCtrl-=> may be I<SUPPOSED> to be
distinct from C<lCtrl-=> and C<rCtrl-=>, and while the last two do not carry the character
payload, the first one does.  Checking I<FIRST> for the absense of C<WM_(SYS)(DEAD)CHAR>
delegates such a discrimination to the kernel, which has enough information about the
intent of the keyboard layout.  (Likewise, the keyboard may define the pair of C<DEADKEY>
and C<Ctrl-A> to insert ᵃ.  Then C<Ctrl-A> alone will not carry any character payload,
its combination with a deadkey may.)

Why the applications are trying to grab the potential special-key messages as early 
as possible?  I suspect that the developers are afraid that otherwise, a keyboard layout may
“steal” important accelerators from the application.  While this is technically possible,
nowadays keyboard accelerators are rarely the I<only> way to access features of the applications;
and among hundreds of keyboard layout I saw, all but 2 or 3 would not “steal” I<anything> from applications.
(Or maybe the developers just have no clue that the correct solution is so simple?)

B<NOTE:> Among the applications I checked, the worst offender is Firefox.  It follows L<a particularly
unfortunate advice by Mike Kaplan|http://blogs.msdn.com/b/michkap/archive/2005/01/19/355870.aspx>
and tries to reconstruct the mentioned above row/columns table of the keyboard layout, then
uses this (heuristically reconstructed) table as a substitute for the real thing.  And
due to the mismatch of languages spoken by kernel and applications, working via such an 
attempted reconstruction turns out to have very little relationship to the actually intended
behaviour of the keyboard (the behaviour observed in less baroque applications).  In particular, if
keyboards uses different modification columns for C<lCtrl-lAlt> and C<AltGr>=C<rAlt>
modifiers, pressing C<AltGr-key> inputs wrong characters in Firefox.

B<NOTE:> Among notable applications which fail spectacularly is Emacs.  The developers
forget that for a generation, it is already XXI century; so they L<use ToAscii() instead of
ToUnicode()|http://fossies.org/linux/misc/emacs-24.3.tar.gz:a/emacs-24.3/src/w32fns.c>!
(Even if ToUnicode() is available, its result is converted to the result of the
corresponding ToAscii() code.)

In addition to 8-bitness, Emacs also suffers from check-for-specials-first syndrome…

=head2 Can an application on Windows accept keyboard events?  Part III: better detection of C<KBDALT> stripping

We explained above that L<it is not possible to make a bullet-proof algorithm
handling the case when C<KBDALT> might have been stripped by the kernel|"Can an application on Windows accept keyboard events?  Part I: insert only">.  The
very naive heuristic algorithm described there will recognize the simplest
cases, but will also have many false positives: for many combinations it will decide
that C<KBDALT> was stripped while it was not.  The result will be that
when the kernel reports that the character C<X> is delivered, the 
application would interpret it as C<Alt-X>, so C<X> would not be inserted.
It will not handle, for example,
the C<lAlt-Menu-key> modifier combinations with L<the assignment of mask
from that section|"A convenient assignment of C<KBD*> bitmaps to modifier keys">.

Indeed, with this assignment, the only combination of modifiers for which the kernel will strip C<KBDALT>
is C<lAlt> (and C<lAlt+Win> if one does not assign any bits to C<Win>).
So C<lAlt-Menu-key> is not stripped, hence the 
correct C<WM_*CHAR> is delivered by the kernel.  However, since this combination is
still visible to the application as having C<Alt>, and not having C<Ctrl>,
it is delivered as the C<SYS> flavor.

So the net result is: one designed a nice assignment of masks to the modifier 
keys.  This assignment makes keypresses successfully navigate around the quirks 
of I<the kernel>’s calculations of the character to deliver.  However, the naive 
algorithm used by I<the application> will force the application to ignore this
correctly delivered character to insert.

A very robust workaround for this problem is introduced in the
L<Part IV|"Can an application on Windows accept keyboard events?  Part IV: application-specific modifiers">.
What we discuss here is a simple heuristic to recognize the combinations involving 
C<Alt> and an “unexpected modifier”, so that these combinations become
exceptions to the rule “C<SYS> flavor means ‘do not insert’”.

B<NAIVE SOLUTION:> when C<WM_SYS*CHAR> message arrives, inspect the virtual keycodes
which are reported as pressed.  Ignore the keycode for the current message.
Ignore the keycodes for “usual modifiers” (C<Shift/Alt/Kana>) which are
expected to keep stripping.  Ignore the keycode for the keys which may be
kept “stuck down” by the keyboards (see L<"Far Eastern keyboards on Windows">).
If some keycode remains, then consider it as an “extra” modifier, and ignore
the fact that the message was of C<SYS> flavor.

So all one must do is to define one user message (for input-by-number-in-progress),
code two very simple routines,  MyTranslateMessage() and HasExtraModifiersHeuristical(), and perform two 
PeekMessage() on KEYDOWN event, and one gets a powerful almost-robust
algorithm for keyboard input on Windows.  (Recall that all the applications
I saw provide close-to-abysmal support of keyboard input on Windows.)

=head2 Can an application on Windows accept keyboard events?  Part IV: application-specific modifiers

Some application handle certain keys as “extra modifiers for the purpose of
application-specific accelerator keypresses”.  For example, Emacs may treat
the C<ApplicationMenu> in this way (as a C<Super> modifier for its bindable-keys
framework).  Usually, C<ApplicationMenu> does not
contribute anything into the ORed mask; hence, C<ApplicationMenu-letter>
combination will deliver the same character as just C<letter> alone.  When
the application treats C<ApplicationMenu-letter> as an accelerator, it must
ignore the character delivered by this combination.

Additionally, many keyboard layouts
use the C<KLLF_ALTGR> flag (it makes the kernel to fake pressing/releasing the 
left C<Ctrl> key when the right C<Alt> is pressed/released) with “standard”
assignments of the ORed masks.  On such keyboards, pressing right C<Alt> (i.e.,
C<AltGr>) delivers the same characters as pressing any C<Ctrl> together with 
any C<Alt>.  On the other hand, an application may distinguish left-C<Ctrl> combinined 
with left-C<Alt> from C<AltGr> pressed
on such keyboards by inspecting which (virtual) keys are currently down.  So the application 
may consider left-C<Ctrl> combinined with left-C<Alt>
as “intended to be an accelerator”; then the application would ignore the characters delivered by
such a keypress.

One can immediately see that such applications would inevitably enter into conflict
with keyboards which B<define> these key combinations.  For example, on a keyboard
which defines an ORed mask for C<ApplicationMenu>, pressing C<ApplicationMenu-letter>
I<should> deliver a different character than pressing C<letter>.  However, the
application does not know this, and just ignores the character delivered by
C<ApplicationMenu-letter>.

A similar situation arises when the keyboard defines C<leftCtrl-leftAlt-letter> to
deliver a different character than C<AltGr-letter>.  Again, the character will be ignored
by the application.  Since the fact that such a “unusual” keyboard is active
implies user's intent, such behaviour is a bug of the application.

B<CONCLUSION:> an application must interpret a keypress as “intended to be an accelerator”
only if this keypress produces no character, or produces B<the same> character as
the key without the “extra” modifier.  (Correspondingly, if replacing C<leftAlt> by
C<rightAlt> does not change the delivered character.)

B<IMPLEMENTATION:> to do this, the application must be able to query “what would happen
if the user pressed different key combinations?”; such a query requires “non-destructive”
calls of ToUnicode().  (These calls must be done I<before> the “actual”, destructive, 
call of ToUnicode() corresponding to the currently pressed down modifiers.)

Fortunately, with the framework described in the
L<Part III|"Can an application on Windows accept keyboard events?  Part III: better detection of C<KBDALT> stripping">,
the call of ToUnicode() is performed with C<wFlags> being 0x01.  As explained near the end of the section
L<"Keyboard input on Windows, Part II: The semantic of ToUnicode()">, this call has a “non-destructive”
flavor!  Hence, for applications with such “enhanced” modifier keys, the logic of the
L<Part III|"Can an application on Windows accept keyboard events?  Part III: better detection of C<KBDALT> stripping">
should be enhanced in the following ways:

=over 4

=item *

Make a non-destructive call of ToUnicode().  Store the result.  If no insertable character
(or deadkey) is delivered, ignore the rest.

=item *

If both left C<Ctrl> and left C<Alt> are down (AND right C<Ctrl> AND right C<Alt> are up!) 
replace left C<Alt> by the right C<Alt>, and
make another non-destructive call of ToUnicode().  If the result is identical to the first one,
mark C<leftCtrl+leftAlt> as “special modifiers present for accelerators”.

Remove left C<Ctrl> and left C<Alt> from the collection of keys which are down (argument to ToUnicde()),
and continue with the previous step.
(This may be generalized to other combinations of left/right C<Alt>/C<Ctrl>.)

=item *

For every other “special modifier” virtual key which is down,
make another non-destructive call of ToUnicode() with this virtual key up.
If the result is identical to the first one, mark this “special modifier” as “present for accelerators”.

=item *

Finally, if nothing suitable for accelerators is found, make a “usual” call of ToUnicode()
(so that on future keypresses the deadkey finite automaton behaves as expected).  Generate the
corresponding messages.

=back

If no insertable character is delivered, or suitable “extra” accelerators are found, the 
process-the-accelerator logic should be triggered.

For example, if the character Ω is delivered, and a special modifier C<ApplicationMenu> is down
and marked as suitable as accelerator, then Ω will be ignored.  The accelerator for C<ApplicationMenu-Ω>
should be triggered.  (Processing this as C<ApplicationMenu-Shift-ω> may be also done.  This may require an 
extra non-destructive call.)

An alternative logic is possible: if this Ω was generated by modifiers C<lCtrl-rAlt-Shift-ApplicationMenu>
with the virtual key C<VK_W>, then the application may query what C<VK_W> generates standalone (for example,
cyrillic ц), and trigger the accelerator for C<Ctrl-Alt-Shift-ApplicationMenu-ц>.  (This assumes that
C<lCtrl-rAlt-Shift> with C<VK_W> generates the same Ω!)

If no character is delivered, then this is a “trivial” situation, and the framework of accelerator keys
should be called as if the complication considered here did not exist.

B<NOTE:> this logic handles the intended behaviour of C<Alt> key as well!  So, with this implementation,
the application would

=over 5

=item *

Handle C<Alt>-NUMPAD input-by-number in an intuitive mostly compatible with Windows way 
(but not bug-for-bug compatible with the Windows' way);

=item *

Would recognize C<Alt> modifier which does not change the delivered character as such.  (So it may be processed
as the menu accessor.)

=item *

Would recognize B<all> the key combinations defined by the keyboard layout (and deliverable via ToUnicode());

=item *

Would recognize all the application-specific extra modifier keys which do not interfere with the
key combinations defined by the keyboard layout.

=back

=head2 Far Eastern keyboards on Windows

The syntax of defining these keyboards is documented in F<kbd.h> of the toolkit.  
The semantic of the NLS table is undocumented.  Here we fix this.

The function returning the NLS table should be exported with ordinal 2.
The offsets of both tables in the module should be below 0x10000.
The keyboard layout should define a function with ordinal 3 or 5 returning 0, or
be loaded through such a function returning non-0; the signature is

    BOOL ordinal5(HKL hkl, LPWSTR __OUT__ dllname , PCLIENTKEYBOARDTYPE type_if_remote_session, LPVOID dummy);
    BOOL ordinal3(LPWSTR __OUT__ dllname);

if return is non-0, keyboard is reloaded from C<dllname>.
    
In short, these layouts have an extra table which may define the following enhancements:

  One 3-state (or 2-state) radio-button:
      on keys with VK codes DBE_ALPHANUMERIC/DBE_HIRAGANA/DBE_KATAKANA
         (the third state can be also toggled independently of the others).
  Three Toggling (like CAPSLOCK) button (pairs): 
      toggling radio-button-like VK codes DBE_SBCSCHAR/DBE_DBCSCHAR, DBE_ROMAN/DBE_NOROMAN, DBE_CODEINPUT/DBE_NOCODEINPUT
  Make key produce different VK codes with different modifiers.
  Make a “reverse NUMPAD” translation.
  Manipulate a couple of bits of IME state.
  A few random hacks for key-deficient hardware layouts.

(Via assigning ORed masks to radio-buttons, the radio-buttons and toggle-buttons above may affect the layout.
Using this, it is easy to convert each toggling buttons to 2-state radiobuttons.
The limitation is that the number of modification columns compatible with the
extra table is at most 8 — counting one for C<Ctrl>.)

Every C<VK> may be associated to two tables of functions, the “normal” one, and the “alternative” one.  For
every modification column, each table
assigns a filter id, and a parameter for the filter.  (Recall that columns are associated
to the ORed masks by the table in the C<MODIFIERS> structure.  One B<must> define all the entries 
in the table — or at least the entries reachable by the 
modifier keys.  B<NOTE:> the limit on the number of states in the tables is 8; it is not clear what happens with the 
states above this; some versions of Windows may buffer-overflow.)

The input/output for the filters consists of: the C<VK>, C<UP>/C<DOWN> flag, the flags associated to the scancode in C<< KBDTABLES->ausVK >>
(may be added to upsteam), the 
parameter given in C<VK_F> structure (and an unused C<DWORD> read/write parameter).  A filter may change these parameters,  
then pass the event forward, or it may ignore an event.  Filters by ID:

  KBDNLS_NULL		Ignore key (should not be called; only for unreachable slots in the tables).
  KBDNLS_NOEVENT	Ignore key.
  KBDNLS_SEND_BASE_VK	Pass through VK unchanged.
  KBDNLS_SEND_PARAM_VK	Replace VK by the number specified as the parameter.

“active” key, then KEYDOWN for the newly activated key.  When switching 3-state, additional
action happens depending on the new state:

  DBE_ALPHANUMERIC	If IME is off, and KANA toggle is on,  switch IME on  in the KATAKANA mode
  DBE_HIRAGANA		If IME is off, and KANA toggle is off, switch IME off in the ALPHANUMERIC mode
  DBE_KATAKANA			SAME AS HIRAGANA

Additionally, C<KEYDOWN> of C<KBDNLS_KANAEVENT> switches IME to

  KANA toggle on:		switch IME off in the ALPHANUMERIC mode
  KANA toggle off:		switch IME on  in the KATAKANA mode

and C<KBDNLS_CONV_OR_NONCONV> (on C<KEYUP> and C<KEYDOWN>) passes through, and does

  KANA toggle on, IME off:	switch IME off in the ALPHANUMERIC mode
  otherwise:			Do nothing

(The semantic of IME being-in/switching-to OFF/ON mode is not clear (probably IME-specific).
The switching happens by
calling C<RequestDeviceChange(pDeviceInfo, GDIAF_IME_STATUS, TRUE)> for devices with a C<handle>
and C<type == DEVICE_TYPE_KEYBOARD>, while putting the request at into global memory — unless
C<IMECOMPAT_HYDRACLIENT> flag is set on the foreground keyboard.)

For C<KBDNLS_HOME_OR_CLEAR>, the registry is checked at statup.  For C<KBDNLS_HELP_OR_END>, the registry is checked at statup, and:

  KANA_AWARE:	flips END/HELP if KANA toggle is ON (on input, “HELP” means not-an-END)
  otherwise:	sends END/HELP depending on what registry says.

The checked values are C<helpkey>, C<KanaHelpKey>, C<clrkey> in the hive C<RTL_REGISTRY_WINDOWS_NT\WOW\keyboard>.

Which of two tables is chosen is controlled by the type (C<NULL>/C<NORMAL>/C<TOGGLE>) of the key's tables, and the (per key) history bit.  
The initial state of the bit is in C<NLSFEProcCurrent> 
(L<StuxNet hits here|http://www.eset.com/us/resources/white-papers/Stuxnet_Under_the_Microscope.pdf>!).
The tables of type C<NULL> are ignored (the key descriptor passes all events 
through), the C<NORMAL> key uses only the first table.  The C<TOGGLE> key uses the first table on KEYDOWN, and 
uses the first or the second table on KEYUP.  The choice depends on modifiers present in the preceding KEYDOWN;
the bitmap C<NLSFEProcSwitch> is indexed by the modification column of KEYDOWN event; the second table is
used on the following KEYUP if the indexed bit is set.  (The KEYREPEAT events are handled the same way as KEYUP.)

The typical usage of C<TOGGLE> keys is to make the KEYUP event match B<what KEYDOWN did> no matter what
is the order of releasing the modifier keys and the main key.
Having the history bit up “propagates” to KEYUP the information about which modifiers were active on KEYDOWN.  This helps in ensuring
consistency of some actions between the KEYDOWN event and the corresponding KEYUP event: remember that the state of modifiers 
on KEYUP is often different than the state on KEYDOWN: people can release modifiers in different orders: 

  press-Shift, press-Enter, release-Shift, release-Enter	--->	Shift-Enter pressed, Enter released
  press-Shift, press-Enter, release-Enter, release-Shift	--->	Shift-Enter pressed and released

If pressing C<Shift-Enter> acts as if it were the C<F38> key (and only so with C<Shift>!), to ensure consistency, one would need 
to make releasing C<Shift-Enter> B<and> also releasing C<Enter> to act as if it were the C<F38> key.  So one can make pressing
C<Shift-Enter> special (via the first table), sets the history bit on C<Shift-Enter>, and make I<the second table> map C<Enter> 
and C<Shift-Enter> to be special too (send C<F38>) I<if the history bit is set>.

B<Remark:> the standard key processing has its own filters too.  C<AltGr> processing adds fake C<lCtrl> up/down events
(provided the flag C<KLLF_ALTGR> is set);
C<Shift-Cancels-CapsLock> processing ignores/fakes the C<KEYDOWN>/C<KEYUP> for C<VK_CAPITAL> (=C<CapsLock>)
(provided the flag C<KLLF_SHIFTLOCK> is set); C<Shift-Multiply> becomes
C<VK_SNAPSHOT> (same for C<Alt>); C<Ctrl-ScrollLck/Numlock> become C<VK_CANCEL>/C<VK_PAUSE>; C<Ctrl-Pause> may become C<VK_CANCEL>.
OEM translations (NumPad→Cursor, except C<C-A-Del>; C<00> to double-press of C<0>) come first, then locale-specific (C<AltGr>,
C<Shift-Cancels-CapsLock>), then those defined in the tables above.

B<Remark:> As opposed to these translations, C<KLLF_LRM_RLM> and C<Alt-NUMPADn> is actually handled inside the 
even loop, by ToUnicode().

B<Remark:> L<http://www.toppa.com/2007/english-windows-xp-with-a-japanese-keyboard/> (and references inside!)
explains fine points of using Japanese keyboards.  See also: L<http://www.coscom.co.jp/learnjapanese801/lesson08.html>.

=head2 A convenient assignment of C<KBD*> bitmaps to modifier keys

In this section, we omit discussion of C<Shift> modifier; so every
bitmap may be further combined with C<KBDSHIFT> to produce two different bindings.
Assign ORed masks to the modifier keys as follows:X<AssignMasksSmart>

  lCtrl		Win	 lAlt		rAlt			Menu		rCtrl
  CTRL|LOYA	CTRL|X1	 ALT|KANA	CTRL|ALT|LOYA|X1	CTRL|ALT|X2	CTRL|ALT|ROYA

with suitable backward-compatible mapping of ORed masks to modification columns.
This assignment allows using C<KLLF_ALTGR> flag (faking presses of C<lCtrl> when
C<rAlt> is pressed — this greatly increases compatibility of C<rAlt> with brain-damaged
applications), all the combinations involving at most one of C<lCtrl>, C<Win> or 
C<rAlt> give distinct ORed masks, it
avoids stripping of C<KBDALT> on C<lAlt> combined with other modifiers,
makes C<CapsLock> work with all relevant combinations, while completely preserving all
application-visible properties of keyboard events [except those with C<lCtrl-Win-lAlt->
modifiers; this combination is equivalent to C<lAlt-rAlt->].

Note that ignoring the C<CTRL> and C<ALT> bits, all combinations of 
C<LOYA,KANA,X1,X2,ROYA> are possible, which gives at least 32 C<Shift>-pairs.
In fact, the only combination of C<LOYA,KANA,X1,X2,ROYA> which may appear with
different C<CTRL,ALT> bits is C<LOYA|X1>; hence there are 33 possible combinations
of C<CTRL,ALT,LOYA,KANA,X1,X2,ROYA>.  Indeed, C<CTRL> is determined by C<LOYA|X1|X2|ROYA>. 
If one of C<KANA,X2,ROYA> is present, then C<ALT> is set; so assume C<KANA,X2,ROYA> are not present. 
But then, if C<ALT> B<may be> set, then both C<LOYA|X1> B<must> be present; which gives the
only duplication.

Leaving out 5 combinations of C<lCtrl>, C<Win>, C<lAlt> [8, minus the empty one, and 
C<lCtrl+lAlt>, which is avoided by most application due to its similarity to C<AltGr=rAlt>,
and C<lCtrl+Win+lAlt> which is undistinguishable by the mask from C<lAlt+rAlt>]
to have bindable keypresses in applications, and having C<rCtrl> as equivalent to
C<lCtrl>, this gives 27 C<Shift>-pairs which may produce characters.

B<NOTE:> C<lCtrl+Win+lAlt> being undistinguishable by the mask from C<lAlt+rAlt>
is not a big deal, since there is no standard keyboard shortcuts involving C<Ctrl+Win+Alt>.

B<NOTE:> Combinations of C<lCtrl> with C<rCtrl> L<cause several problems|"C<lCtrl-rCtrl> combination: multiple problems">;
likewise for L<combinations of C<lAlt> with C<rAlt> |"C<lAlt-rAlt> combination: many keys are not delivered to applications">.

B<NOTE:> Removing the binding for C<Win> key, only 21 useful C<Shift>-pairs remain.
(This is what C<version 0.63> of L<izKeys keyboard layout|http://k.ilyaz.org/iz> is
using; out of 24 distinct combinations, C<lAlt>, C<lCtrl> and C<rCtrl> should be
excluded.)  B<Trivia:> While this may look as a complete overkill, recall that characters
outside BMP can be inserted on Windows I<only> via one keypress, possibly with many
modifiers. (This restriction relates only to the “classical” flavor of Windows keyboard layouts).
Unicode L<defines 18 additional Latin/Greek alphabets for mathematical
discourse|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_Alphanumeric_Symbols>.  If a keyboard
layout would want to support these letters, this would quickly exhaust the possible combinations
of modifiers.  (For 2-script layout, one could live with Latin/AltGr-Latin/Greek + 18 mathematical
alphabets.  But for layouts supporting more scripts, it lookes like using C<Win> key is not
avoidable.)

B<NOTE:> Applications may call ToUnicode() with I<impossible combinations> of modifiers:
for example, they may "put" C<Ctrl> down, but do not specify whether it is C<rCtrl> or
C<lCtrl>.  Likewise for C<Alt>.

To support that, one would need to define a mask for standalone C<VK_CONTROL> and C<VK_MENU>
(i.e., C<Ctrl> and C<Alt>).  Since these modifiers are present when the real “left-right-handed”
keys are down, the masks should be “contained” in the masks of handed keys.  B<Example:> one
can make the pseudo-key C<Ctrl> to generate bit C<CTRL>, and the pseudo-key C<Alt> to generate
the bit C<ALT>.  Then for any combination of modifiers with unhanded C<Ctrl> and/or C<Alt>,
either the corresponding combination of bits is supported by the layout (and then the
application will access the corresponding modification column — which is probably not
the “expected” column corresponding to some handed flavor), or the combination is not
yet defined.  In the latter case, one may actually decide I<how> to resolve this: one can
map this combination of modifiers to an arbitatrary modification column!

In particular, one can map such combination of modifiers to a certain choice of handedness
of C<Ctrl> and C<Alt>.  (An example of such a problematic application is L<Firefox|"Firefox misinterprets keypresses">;
look for “I<impossible modifier>”.)

B<NOTE:> Some applications may do a "reverse lookup" using 
L<C<VkKeyScanW()>|https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms646329%28v=vs.85%29.aspx> 
(this is B<the only> API which exposes the modifier masks).  Most of these calls would not
know anything about "higher bits", only S/C/A would be covered.  In particular,
it makes sense to add "fake" entries mapping combinations of bits 0x1/0x2/0x4 to the
"corresponding" modification columns.

For example, C<rAlt> above would produce modififier mask C<CTRL|ALT|LOYA|X1>; 
this mask would access a certain column in the table of bindings; make the 
mask C<CTRL|ALT> access the same column.  Then an application making a lookup
for a certain character via VkKeyScanW() would see C<CTRL|ALT>.  Since this is
the mask which is I<usually> produced by pressing C<rAlt>, the application
would think (correctly! — but only thanks to this fake entry) that this character 
may be produced with C<rAlt> modifier.

B<NOTE:> The maximal number of “modification columns” supported by Windows is 126.  A
larger number would make the size of C<VK_TO_WCHARS...> to overflow the maximal number
storable in the field C<VK_TO_WCHAR_TABLE.cbSize> of type C<BYTE> = C<unsigned char>.

Given that the column 15 is ignored, this reduces the number of strings associated to
a keypress (with different “modifiers”) to 125.

=head1 WINDOWS GOTCHAS

First of all, keyboard layouts on Windows are controlled by DLLs; the only function
of these DLLs is to export a table of "actions" to perform.  This table is passed
to the kernel, and that's it - whatever is not supported by the format of this table
cannot be implemented by native layouts.  (The DLL performs no "actions" when
actual keyboard events arrive.)

Essentially, the logic is like that: there are primary "keypresses", and
chained "keypresses" ("prefix keys" [= deadkeys] and keys pressed after them).  
Primary keypresses are distinguished by which physical key on keyboard is 
pressed, and which of "modifier keys" are also pressed at this moment (as well
as the state of "latched keys" - usually C<CapsLock> only, but may be also C<Kana>).  This combination
determines which Unicode character is generated by the keypress, and whether
this character starts a "chained sequence".

On the other hand, the behaviour of chained keys is governed I<ONLY> by Unicode
characters they generate: if there are several physical keypresses generating
the same Unicode characters, these keypresses are completely interchangeable
inside a chained sequence.  (The only restriction is that the first keypress
should be marked as "prefix key"; for example, there may be two keys producing
B<-> so that one is producing a "real dash sign", and another is producing a
"prefix" B<->.)

The table allows: to map C<ScanCode>s to C<VK_key>s; to associate a C<VK_key> to several
(numbered) choices of characters to output, and mark some of these choices as prefixes
(deadkeys).  (These "base" choices may contain up to 4 16-bit characters (with 32-bit
characters mapped to 2 16-bit surrogates); but only those with 1 16-bit character may
be marked as deadkeys.)  For each prefix character (not a prefix key!) one can
associate a table mapping input 16-bit "base characters" to output 16-bit characters,
and mark some of the output choices as prefix characters.

The numbered choices above are determined by the state of "modifier keys" (such as
C<Shift>, C<Alt>, C<Control>), but not directly.  First of all, C<VK_keys> may be
associated to a certain combination of 6 "modifier bits" (called "logical" C<Shift>,
C<Alt>, C<Control>, C<Kana>, C<User1> and C<User2>, but the logical bits are not 
required to coincide with names of modifier keys).  (Example: one can bind C<Right Control>
to activate C<Shift> and C<Kana> bits.)  The 64 possible combinations of modifier bits
are mapped to the numbered choices above.

Additionally, one can define two "separate 
numbered choices" in presence of CapsLock (but the only allowed modifier bit is C<Shift>).
The another way to determine what C<CapsLock> is doing: one can mark that it 
flips the "logical C<Shift>" bit (separately on no-modifiers state, C<Control-Alt>-only state,
and C<Kana>-only state [?!] - here "only" allow for the C<Shift> bit to be C<ON>).

C<AltGr> key is considered equivalent to C<Control-Alt> combination (of those
are present, or always???), and one cannot bind C<Alt> and C<Alt-Shift> combinations.  
Additionally, binding bare C<Control> modifier on alphabetical keys (and
C<SPACE>, C<[>, C<]>, C<\>) may confuse some applications.

B<NOTE:> there is some additional stuff allowed to be done (but only in presence
of Far_East_Support installed???).  FE-keyboards can define some sticky state (so
may define some other "latching" keys in addition to C<CapsLock>).  However,
I did not find a clear documentation yet (C<keyboard106> in the DDK toolkit???).

There is a tool to create/compile the required DLL: F<kbdutool.exe> of I<MicroSoft 
Keyboard Layout Creator> (with a graphic frontend F<MSKLC.exe>).  The tool does 
not support customization of modifier bits, and has numerous bugs concerning binding keys which
usually do not generate characters.  The graphic frontend does not support
chained prefix keys, adds another batch of bugs, and has arbitrarily limitations:
refuses to work if the compiled version of keyboard is already installed;
refuses to work if C<SPACE> is redefined in useful ways.

B<WORKFLOW:> uninstall the keyboard, comment the definition of C<SPACE>,
load in F<MSKLC> and create an install package.  Then uncomment the
definition of C<SPACE>, and compile 4 architecture versions using F<kbdutool>,
moving the DLLs into suitable directories of the install package.  Install
the keyboard.

For development cycle, one does not need to rebuild the install package
while recompiling.

The following sections classify GOTCHAS into 3 categories:

L<"WINDOWS GOTCHAS for keyboard users">

L<"WINDOWS GOTCHAS for keyboard developers using MSKLC">

L<"WINDOWS GOTCHAS for keyboard developers (problems in kernel)">

=head1 WINDOWS GOTCHAS for keyboard users

=head2 MSKLC keyboards not working on Windows 8 without reboot

The layout is shown as active, but "preview" is grayed out,
and is not shown on the Win-Space list.    See also:

  http://www.errordetails.com/125726/activate-custom-keyboard-layout-created-with-msklc-windows

The workaround is to reboot.  Compare with

  http://blogs.msdn.com/b/michkap/archive/2012/03/12/10281199.aspx

=head2 Default keyboard of an application

Apparently, there is no way to choose a default keyboard for a certain
language.  The configuration UI allows moving keyboards up and down in
the list, but, apparently, this order is not related to which keyboard
is selected when an application starts.  (This may be fixed on Windows 8?)

=head2 Hex input of unicode is not enabled

One needs to explicitly tinker with the registry (see F<examples/enable-hex-unicode-entry.reg>)
and then I<reboot> to enable this.

=head2 Standard fonts have some chars exchanged

At least in Consolas and Lucida Sans Unicode φ and ϕ are exchanged.
Compare with Courier and Times.  (This may be due to the L<difference between
Unicode's pre-v3.0 choice of representative glyphs|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phi#Computing>, 
or the L<difference
between French/English Apla=Didot/Porson's approaches|http://www.greekfontsociety.gr/pages/en_typefaces19th.html>.)

=head2 The console font configuration

According to L<MicroSoft|http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;EN-US;Q247815>, it is controlled by Registry hive

  HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Console\TrueTypeFont

The key C<0> usually gives C<Lucida Console>, and the key C<00>
gives C<Consolas>.  Adding random numbers does not work; however,
if one adds one more zero (at least when adding to a sequence of zeros),
one can add more fonts.
You need to export this hive (e.g., use

  reg export "HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Console\TrueTypeFont" console-ttf.reg

), save a copy (so you can always restore if the love goes sour)
then edit the resulting file.

So if the maximal key with 0s is C<00>, add one extra row with an extra 0
at end, and the family name of your font.  The "family name" is what the Font
list in C<Control Panel> shows for I<font families> (a "stacked" icon is shown);
for individual fonts the weight (Regular, Book, Bold etc) is appended.  So I add a line

  "000"="DejaVu Sans Mono"

the result is (omitting Far Eastern fonts)

  Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00

  [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Console\TrueTypeFont]
  "949"="..."
  "0"="Lucida Console"
  "950"="..."
  "932"="..."
  "936"="..."
  "00"="Consolas"
  "000"="DejaVu Sans Mono"

The full file is in F<examples/console-fonts00-added.reg>.  After importing this
file via F<reg> (or give it as parameter to F<regedit>; both require administrative priviledges)
the font is immediately available in menu.  (However, it does not work in "existing"
console windows, only in newly created windows.)

B<(Do not use the example file directly.  First inspect the hive exported on your system,
and find the number of 0s to use.  Then add a new line with correct number of
zeros - as a value, one can use the string above.  This will I<preserve> the defaults
of your setup.>  Keep in mind that
selection-by-fontfamily is buggy: if you have more than one version of the font
in different weight, it is a Russian Rullette which one of them will be taken
(at least for DejaVu, which uses C<Book> as the default weight).  First install
the "normal" flavor of the font, then do as above (so the system has no way of picking
the wrong flavor!), and only after this install the remaining
flavors.

B<NOTE:> keep in mind that I distribute a good-for-console L<“merge” of two
fonts|http://ilyaz.org/software/fonts/>: C<DejaVu + Unifont Smooth>; C<DejaVu> brings
in nicely shaped nicely-scalable 
glyphs, and C<Unifont Smooth> brings a scalable font with complete coverage of BMP (as of 2015, of Unicode C<v7.0>).
(We omit Han/Hangul since it does not fit in a narrow box of a console font.
(As of 2015, it does not include U+30fb since apparently, this breaks display of 
"undefined" character in PUA in Windows' console.)

B<CAVEAT:> the string to put into C<Console\TrueTypeFont> is the I<Family Name> of the font.
The family name is what is shown in the C<Fonts> list of the C<Control Panel> — but only
for families with more than one font; otherwise the “metric name” of the font is appended.

On Windows, it is tricky to find the family name using the default Windows' tools, without
inspecting the font in a font editor.  One workaround is to select the font in C<Character Map>
application, then inspect C<HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\CharMap\Font> via:

  reg export HKCU\Software\Microsoft\CharMap character-map-font.reg

Note: the mentioned above MicroSoft KB article lists the wrong way to find the family name.
What is visible in the C<Properties> dialogue of the font, and in C<CurrentVersion\Fonts> is the
I<Full Font Name>.  Fortunately, quite often the full name and the family name coincide —
this is what happened with C<DejaVu>.  To find the "Full name" of the font, one can look into the hive

  HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Fonts
  reg export "HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Fonts" fonts.reg

For example, after installing C<DejaVuSansMono.ttf>, I see
C<DejaVu Sans Mono (TrueType)> as a key in this hive.  

B<One more remark:> for desktop icons coming from the “Public” user (“shared”
icons) which start a console application, the default font is not directly editable.
To reset it, one must:

=over

=item *

copy the F<.lnk> icon file to “your” desktop directory;

=item *

start the application using the “new” icon;

=item *

change the font via “Properties” of the window's menu;

=item *

as administrator, copy the F<.lnk> file back to the F<Public/Desktop>
directory (usually in something like F<C:/Users>).  Manually refresh
the desktop.  Verify that the “old” icon works as expected.
(Now you can remove the “new” icon created on the first step.)

=back

=head2 There is no way to show Unicode contents on Windows

Until Firefox C<v13>, one could use FireFox to show arbitrary
Unicode text (limited only by which fonts are installed on your
system).  If you upgraded to a newer version, there is no (AFAIK)
Windows program (for general public consumption) which would visualize
Unicode text.  The applications are limited either (in the worst case) by
the characters supported by the currently selected font, or (in the best
case) they can show additionally characters, but only those considered by the
system as "important enough" (coming from a few of default fonts?).

There is a workaround for this major problem in FireFox (present at least
up to C<v20>).  The problem is caused
by L<this “improvement”|https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=705594>
which blatantly saves a few seconds of load time for a tiny minority of
users, the price being an unability to show Unicode I<for everybody>
(compare with comments L<33|https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=705594#c33> 
and L<75|https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=705594#c75> on the bug report above).

It is not documented, but this action is controlled by C<about:config>
setting C<gfx.font_rendering.fallback.always_use_cmaps>.  To enable Unicode,
make this setting into C<true> (if you have it in the list as C<false>, double-clicking it would
do this — do search to determine this; otherwise you need to create a new
C<Binary> entry).

There is an alternative/additional way to enable extra fonts; it makes
sense if you know a few character-rich fonts present on your system.  The (undocumented)
settings C<font.name-list.*.x-unicode> (apparently) control fallback fonts for situations
when a suitable font cannot be found via more specific settings.  For example, when
you installed (free) L<Deja vu|http://dejavu-fonts.org/>, 
L<junicode|http://junicode.sourceforge.net/>, L<Symbola|http://users.teilar.gr/~g1951d/> fonts on your system, you may set (these
variables are not present by default; you need to create new C<String> variables):

  font.name-list.sans-serif.x-unicode	DejaVu Sans,Symbola,DejaVu Serif,DejaVu Sans Mono,Junicode,Unifont Smooth
  font.name-list.serif.x-unicode	DejaVu Serif,Symbola,Junicode,DejaVu Sans,Symbola,DejaVu Sans Mono,Unifont Smooth
  font.name-list.cursive.x-unicode	Junicode,Symbola,DejaVu Sans,DejaVu Serif,DejaVu Sans Mono,Unifont Smooth
  font.name-list.monospace.x-unicode	DejaVu Sans Mono,DejaVu Sans,Symbola,DejaVu Serif,Junicode,Unifont Smooth

And maybe also L<Fantasy|http://shallowsky.com/blog/tech/web/firefox-cursive-fantasy.html>
  
  font.name-list.fantasy.x-unicode	Symbola,DejaVu Serif,Junicode,DejaVu Sans Mono,DejaVu Sans,Unifont Smooth

(Above, we use the L<C<Unifont Smooth>||http://ilyaz.org/software/fonts/> 
as the font of last resort.  Although the glyphs are very coarse, in this role 
it is very useful since it contains all the Unicode C<v7.0> characters in BMP.  

B<Note:> L<the standard distribution|http://unifoundry.com/unifont.html> of C<Unifont>
contains “fake” glyphs for characters not supported by the font.  Such a design error is unexcusable for a TrueType font; this gets 
in the way when an application tries to find the best way to show a character.  Using 
(non-C<Mono> variant of) my “C<Smooth>” re-build not only fixes this (and some others) problems, 
but also makes the font nicely scalable — the original works well only in the size 16px.

If you set both: the C<font.*> variables with rich enough fonts, 
B<and> C<gfx.font_rendering.fallback.always_use_cmaps>,
then you may have the best of both worlds: the situation when a character cannot
be shown via C<font.*> settings will be extremely rare, so the possiblity of delay
due to C<gfx.font_rendering.fallback.always_use_cmaps> is irrelevant.

=head2 Firefox misinterprets keypresses

=over 4

=item *

Multiple prefix keys are not supported.

=item *

C<AltGr-0> and C<Shift-AltGr-0> are recognized as a character-generating
keypress (good!), but the character they produce bears little relationship
to what keyboard produces.  (In our examples, the character may be available
only via multiple prefix keys!)

=item *

After a prefix key, C<Control-(Shift-)letter> is not recognized as a
character-generating key.

=item *

C<Kana-Enter> is not recognized as a character-generating key.

=item *

C<Alt-+-HEXDIGITS> is not recognized as a character-generating key sequence (recall
that C<Alt> should be pressed all the time, and other keys C<+ HEXDIGITS> should be
pressed+released sequentially).

=item *

When keyboard has an “extra” modifier key in addition to C<Shift/Alt/Ctrl> (an
analogue of C<Kana> key), combining it with C<Ctrl> or with C<Alt> is interpreted
by Firefox as if only C<Ctrl> or C<Alt> were pressed.

=item *

When keyboard generates different characters on C<AltGr> than on C<Control-Alt>
(possible with assigning extra modifier bits to C<AltGr>), FireFox interprets any
C<AltGr-Key> as if it were C<Control-Alt-Key>.

C<Exception:> when C<AltGr-Fkey> produces a character, this character is understood
correctly by FF.  Same for C<AltGr-arrowKey> (but again, while this works on numeric
keypad, it is still buggy if C<NumLock> is on, or if the key is C<Numpad-Enter>.)

=item *

The keyboard may have C<rCtrl> which produces the same characters as C<lCtrl>, but
which behaves differently when combined with other keys.  FireFox ignores these
differences.

This is combinable with other remarks above: e.g., C<rCtrl-Kana> is interpreted
by FireFox as C<lCtrl>.

=item *

In addition to this, Firefox replaces C<rCtrl> and C<lCtrl> modifiers by
an I<impossible modifier>: Firefox pretends that I<only> C<unhandedCtrl> is down.  (Here
C<unhandedCtrl> is a fake key C<VK_CONTROL> which Window pretends is down when either one
of C<rCtrl> or C<lCtrl> is down.)  Since the situation when C<unhandedCtrl>
is down, but neither C<rCtrl> nor C<lCtrl> are down is not possible, this
may access parts of the keyboard layout not visible to other applications.
(Same for C<lAlt> and C<rAlt>.)

The net effect is that key combinations involving C<Ctrl> or C<Alt> keys
may behave wrong in Firefox.  For example, with version C<0.63> of
L<izKeys keyboard layout|http://k.ilyaz.org/iz>, C<Ctrl> and C<Alt>
are ignored on character-producing keys.

=item *

If C<lCtrl-lAlt-comma> produces C< — > (this is C<U+200A U+2014 U+200A>), and
C<AltGr-comma> produces the “cedilla deadkey”, then pressing C<AltGr-comma c>
acts as both: first C<U+200A U+2014 U+200A> are inserted, then C<ç>. 

=item *

A subtle variation of the previous failure mode: If C<lCtrl-lAlt-`> produces
deadkey X, and C<AltGr-`> produces the deadkey Y, then combining C<AltGr-`>
with C<a> gives the expected Y*a combination.  However, if combining with
something more complicated (C<Control-Alt-a> or C<Kana-f>), with what
deadkey Y is not combinable, B<THEN> the bugs strike:

=over 4

=item 1

in the first case the deadkey behaves as X: it produces a pair of characters
C<Xα>; here C<Control-Alt-a> produces C<α>.  (Keep in mind that inserting two
characters is the expected behaviour outside of Firefox, but Firefox usually
“eats” an undefined deadkey combination; and note that it is X, not the
expected Y!).

=item 2

in the second case it produces only the character C<ф> generated by C<Kana-f>.  Here
the behaviour is neither as outside Firefox (where it would produce C<Yф>) nor as
usual in Firefox (where it would eat the undefined sequence).

=back

=back

Of these problems, C<Chrome> has only C<Control-(Shift-)letter> one, but a very cursory inspection shows
other problems: C<Kana-arrows> are not recognized as character-generating keys.  (And IE9 just
crashes in most of these situations…)

=head2 C<AltGr>-keypresses triggering some actions

For example, newer versions of windows have graphics driver reacting on C<Ctrl-Alt-Arrow>s by
rotating the screen.  Usually, when you know which application is stealing your keypresses, one
can find a way to disable or reconfigure this action.

For screen rotation: Right-Click on desktop, “Graphics Options”, “Hot Keys”, disable.  The way to
reconfigure this is to use “Graphics Properties” instead of “Graphics Options” (but this may depend
on your graphics subsystem).

=head2 C<AltGr>-keypresses going nowhere

Some C<AltGr>-keypresses do not result in the corresponding letter on
keyboard being inserted.  It looks like they are stolen by some system-wide
hotkeys.  See:

  http://www.kbdedit.com/manual/ex13_replacing_altgr_with_kana.html

If these keypresses would perform some action, one might be able to deduce
how to disable the hotkeys.  So the real problem comes when the keypress
is silently dropped.

I found out one scenario how this might happen, and how to fix this particular
situation.  (Unfortunately, it did not fix what I see, when C<AltGr-s> [but not
C<AltGr-S>] is stolen.)  Installing a shortcut, one can associate a hotkey to
the shortcut.  Unfortunately, the UI allows (and encourages!) hotkeys of the
form <Control-Alt-letter> (which are equivalent to C<AltGr-letter>) - instead
of safe combinations like C<Control-Alt-F4> or
C<Alt-Shift-letter> (which — by convention — are ignored by keyboard drivers, and do not generate
characters).  If/when an application linked to by this shortcut is
gone, the hotkey remains, but now it does nothing (no warning or dialogue comes).

If the shortcut is installed in one of "standard places", one can find it.

=head2 C<Control-Shift>-keypresses starting bloatware applications

(Seen on IdeaPad.)  Some pre-installed programs may steal C<Control-Shift>-keypresses;
it may be hard to understand what is the name of the application even when
the stealing results in user-visible changes.

One way to deal with it is to start C<Task Manager> in C<Processes> (or
C<Details>) panel, and click on CPU column until one gets decreasing-order
of CPU percentage.  Then one can try to detect which process is becoming
active by watching top rows when the action happens (or when one manages to
get back to the desktop from the full-screen bloatware); one may need to
repeat triggering this action several times in a row.  After you know
the name of executable, you can google to find out how to disable it, and/or
whether it is safe to kill this process.

B<Example:> On IdeaPad, it was F<TouchZone.exe> (safe to kill).  It was stealing 
C<Control-Shift-R> and C<Control-Shift-T>. 

B<Example:> On MSI, a similar stealer was F<MGSysCtrl.exe> (some claim it is used to show on-screen
animation when special laptop keys are pressed; if you do not need them, it is safe
to kill).  It was stealing C<Control-Alt-s>.  (But to find I<this> one, I needed to
kill all suspicious apps one by one…)

=head1 WINDOWS GOTCHAS for keyboard developers using MSKLC

=head2 Several similar F<MSKLC> created keyboards may confuse the system

Apparently, the system may get majorly confused when the C<description>
of the project gets changed without changing the DLL (=project) name.
   
(Tested only with Win7 and the name in the DESCRIPTIONS section
coinciding with the name on the KBD line - both in F<*.klc> file.)
   
The symptoms: I know how one can get 4 different lists of keyboards:

=over 4

=item 1

Click on the keyboard icon in the C<Language Bar> - usually shown
on the toolbar; positioned to the right of the language code EN/RU 
etc (keyboard icon is not shown if only one keyboard is associated
to the current language).

=item

Go to the C<Input Language> settings (e.g., right-click on the 
Language bar, Settings, General.

=item

on this C<General> page, press C<Add> button, go to the language
in question.

=item

Check the F<.klc> files for recently installed Input Languages.

=item

In MS Keyboard Layout Creator, go to C<File/Load Existing Keyboard>
list.

=back
        
It looks like the first 4 get in sync if one deletes all related keyboards,
then installs the necessary subset.  I do not know how to fix 5 - MSKLC
continues to show the old name for this project.

Another symptom: Current language indicator (like C<EN>) on the language
bar disappears.  (Reboot time?)

Is it related to C<***\Local Settings\MuiCache\***> hive???

Possible workaround: manually remove the entry in C<HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\ControlSet001\Control\Keyboard Layouts>
(the last 4 digits match the codepage in the F<.klc> file).
   
=head2 Too long description (or funny characters in description?)

If the name in the C<DESCRIPTIONS> section is too long, the name shown in 
the list C<2> above may be empty.
    
(Checked only on Win7 and when the name in the DESCRIPTIONS section
coincides with the name on the C<KBD> line - both in F<*.klc> file.
Length=63 works fine, Length=64 triggers the bug.)
   
(Fixed by shortening the name [but see
L<"Several similar F<MSKLC> created keyboards may confuse the system">
above!], so maybe it was
not the length but some particular character (C<+>?) which was confusing
the system.  (I saw a report on F<MSKLC> bug when description had apostroph
character C<'>.)
   
=head2 F<MSKLC> ruins names of dead key when reading a F<.klc>

When reading a F<.klc> file, MS Keyboard Layout Creator may ruin the names
of dead keys.  Symptom: open the dialogue for a dead key mapping
(click the key, check that C<Dead key view> has checkmark, click on the
C<...> button near the C<Dead key?> checkbox); then the name (the first 
entry field) contains some junk.  (Looks like a long ASCII string 

   U+0030 U+0030 U+0061 U+0039

.)

B<Workaround:> if all one needs is to compile a F<.klc>, one can run
F<KBDUTOOL> directly.

B<Workaround:> correct ALL these names manually in MSKLC.  If the names are
the Unicode name for the dead character, just click the C<Default> button 
near the entry field.  Do this for ALL the dead keys in all the registers
(including C<SPACE>!).  If C<CapsLock> is not made "semantically meaningful",
there are 6 views of the keyboard (C<PLAIN, Ctrl, Ctrl+Shift, Shift,
AltGr, AltGr+Shift>) - check them all for grayed out keys (=deadkeys).
   
Check for success: C<File/"Save Source File As>, use a temporary name.  
Inspect near the end of the generated F<.klc> file.  If OK, you can
go to the Project/Build menu.  (Likewise, this way lets you find which
deadkey's names need to be fixed.)
   
!!! This is time-consuming !!!  Make sure that I<other> things are OK
before you do this (by C<Project/Validate>, C<Project/Test>).
   
BTW: It might be that this is cosmetic only.  I do not know any bad
effect - but I did not try to use any tool with visual feedback on
the currently active sub-layout of keyboard.

=head2 Double bug in F<KBDUTOOL> with dead characters above 0x0fff

This line in F<.klc> file is treated correctly by F<MSKLC>'s builtin keyboard tester:

  39 SPACE 0 0020 00a0@ 0020 2009@ 200a@ //  ,  ,  ,  ,   // SPACE, NO-BREAK SPACE, SPACE, THIN SPACE, HAIR SPACE

However, via F<kbdutool> it produces the following two bugs:

  static ALLOC_SECTION_LDATA MODIFIERS CharModifiers = {
    &aVkToBits[0],
    7,
    {
    //  Modification# //  Keys Pressed
    //  ============= // =============
        0,            // 
        1,            // Shift 
        2,            // Control 
        SHFT_INVALID, // Shift + Control 
        SHFT_INVALID, // Menu 
        SHFT_INVALID, // Shift + Menu 
        3,            // Control + Menu 
        4             // Shift + Control + Menu 
     }
  };

    {VK_SPACE     ,7      ,0x200a   ,0x200a   },

Essentially, C<2009@ 200a@> produce C<LIGATURES> (= multiple 16-bit chars)
instead of deadkeys.  Moreover, these ligatures are put on non-existing
"modifications" 6, 7 (the maximal modification defined is 4; so the code uses
the C<Shift + Control + Menu> flags instead of "modification number" in
the ligatures table.

=head2 F<MSKLC> keyboards handle C<Ctrl-Shift-letter>, C<Ctrl-@ (x00)> , C<Ctrl-^ (x1e)> and C<Ctrl-_ (x1f)> differently than US keyboard

The US keyboard produces (as the 
“string value”) the corresponding Control-letter when 
C<Ctrl-Shift-letter> is pressed.  (In console applications,  
C<\x00> is not visible.)  F<MSKLC> does not reproduces this
behaviour.  This may break an application if
it was not specifically tested with “complicated” keyboards.

The only way to fix this from the “naive” keyboard
layout DLL (i.e., the kind that F<MSKLC> generates) which I found is to
explicitly include C<Ctrl-Shift> as a handled combination, and return
C<Ctrl-letter> on such keypresses.  (This is enabled in the generated
keyboards generated by this module - not customizable in v0.12.)

=head2 F<kbdutool> cannot ignore column=15 of the keybinding definition table

(Compare with L<"Windows ignores column=15 of the keybinding definition table">.)

F<kbdutool> requires that all the columns are associated to a modifier-bitmap.
But column=15 should not be associated to any.

The workaround is to associate it to the bitmap which should not be bound to any
column (like C<4=KBDALT>).  In the output C<.C> file, one would have 15 instead
of C<SHFT_INVALID> for the bitmap 4, but C<SHFT_INVALID> is defined to be 15 anyway…

=head2 F<kbdutool> ignores bits above 0x20 in the modification columns descriptor

=head2 F<kbdutool> cannot assign more than one bitmask to a modification column

Time to switch to direct generation of F<.C> files?

(Quite often, one combination of modifiers should produce the same characters as
another one.  The format of keyboard layout tables allows them to share a
modification column.  The format of F<.klc> files does not allow sharing.)

=head2 F<kbdutool> forgets to emit C<aVkToWch3>/6/8

If the F<.klc> file has many modification columns, the emitted aVkToWcharTable 
contains only C<aVkToWch1>/2.

=head2 F<kbdutool> places C<KbdTables> at end of the generated F<.c> file

The offset of this structure should be no more than 0x10000.  Thus keyboards
with large tables of prefixed keys may fail to load.  This may be related to
the bug L<"If data in C<KEYNAME_DEAD> takes too much space, keyboard is mis-installed, and “Language Bar” goes crazy">.

Time to switch to direct generation of F<.C> files?

=head2 Error "the required resource DATABASE is missing" from F<setup.exe>

The localized C<DESCRIPTION> in F<.klc> file contains a character outside of
the repertoir of the codepage in question.  Removing offending characters, or
removing the C<DESCRIPTION> altogether should fix this.  (But either way, the name of
layout in the C<Settings> of the Language Bar may become empty.)  Having a
different localized description has a side effect that the name of the layout
shown in the Language Bar popups is localized.

(The localized description is what put into the C<resource=1000> of the
DLL file; it is this resource which is mentioned in the registry.  (There
will be no such resource when the localized C<DESCRIPTION> is missing.)

(The failure of F<setup.exe> is not reproducible after a reboot!)

Apparently, this has nothing to do with the length, so the (older) conjectures
below are wrong (although the F<.RC> file generated by MSKLC has the [non-localized] name
truncated after 40 chars in the field C<FileDescription> — but not in other fields):

It looks like there is a buffer overflow in MSKLC, and sometimes the generated
F<setup.exe> in the install package would just exit with this error.  The
apparent reason is the length of the C<DESCRIPTION>-like fields.

Workaround: it looks like the C<DESCRIPTION> field is not used in F<setup.exe>.
So generate an “extra dummied” F<.klc> file I<too> (with shortened descriptions), 
make an install package from it, and mix the F<setup.exe> from the “extra 
dummied” variant with the rest of the install package from a 
“less dummied” F<.klc> file.

The alternative is to get rid of F<setup.exe> completely, and ask users
to run the appropriate F<.msi> file from the install package by hand
(choosing basing on 32-bit vs 64-bit architecture).

=head2 Summary of the productive workflow with F<.klc>:

If direct generation of F<.C> files is out of question, the following workflow
may be used (some of these steps may be omitted depending on how complicated
your F<.klc> layout is; for practical implementation, see
L<the example of F<.klc> creation|http://cpansearch.perl.org/src/ILYAZ/UI-KeyboardLayout/examples/build-iz.pl>
and L<the example of F<.klc> to F<.dll> 
processing|http://cpansearch.perl.org/src/ILYAZ/UI-KeyboardLayout/examples/build_here.cmd>):

=over 4

=item

Make an “extra dummied” F<.klc> (short descriptions, short dummy C<SHIFTSTATE>,
C<LAYOUT>, C<DEADKEY>, C<KEYNAME_DEAD> sections, no C<LIGATURE> section).  Run
it through GUI MSKLC (C<Alt-P Enter>, then C<Alt-P B Enter Enter>, C<Alt-F4>).
Store the generated F<setup.exe>, rename the directory.

=item

Make a “less dummied” F<.klc> file (as above, but with the correct description).
Do as above, and mix in the F<setup.exe> from the previous step.

=item

Run the “real” F<.klc> file through the F<kbdutool> CLI.  Fix errors in the
generated F<.C> and F<.H> files (using scripts and patches if needed).

(One may need to remove a few lines in the C<LAYOUT> section to avoid buffer overflows too.)

=item

Compile the fixed F<.C> files.  (One may need to split them in two to
decrease the offset of the static table in the DLL to the level
Windows can handle: less than 64K.)  Mix the generated F<.dll> files
with the install package made above.

=head1 WINDOWS GOTCHAS for application developers (problems in kernel)

=head2 Many applications need to know the state of hidden flag C<KLLF_ALTGR>

To decide what to do with a keypress, an application may need to know
whether C<KLLF_ALTGR> is enabled in the keyboard (in other words, if
C<left-Control> is faked when C<right-Alt> is pressed).  For example, when
the kernel processes accelerators, it would not trigger C<Ctrl-Alt-A>
if C<A> was pressed with C<right-Alt> in the presence of this flag — even
though C<left-Ctrl> I<IS> visible as being pressed (one needs to press
C<left-Alt + right-Control>).

An application with configurable bindings may need to emulate this action
of TranslateMessage().  One of the ways to do this may be to do (when
C<left-Control> and C<right-Alt> are down)

=over 4

=item *

Set a global flag disabling processing of C<WM_(SYS)COMMAND> in the application;

=item *

Call TranslateAccelerator() with an improbably virtual key (C<VK_OEM_AX> or
some such) and appropriate ad hoc translation table;

=item *

Check whether accelerator was recognized (if so, C<KLLF_ALTGR> is not enabled).

=back

Possible problems with this approach: the “improbable key” should better not
trigger some system accelerator (this is why one should not use “ordinary”
keys).  Additionally, some system accelerators react on Windows key as a
modifier; so acceleration table may specify this as a certain flag.  This
would imply that the algorithm above may not work when C<Windows> key is
down.  (Not tested.)

(Or maybe these C<Win-key> bindings are not accelerators, and are
processed in a different part of keyboard input events. — Then there is
little to worry about.)

=head1 WINDOWS GOTCHAS for keyboard developers (problems in kernel)

=head2 It is hard to understand what a keyboard really does

To inspect the output of the keyboard in the console mode (may be 8-bit,
depending on how Perl is compiled), one can run

  perl -MWin32::Console -wle 0 || cpan install Win32::Console
  perl -we "sub mode2s($){my $in = shift; my @o; $in & (1<<$_) and push @o, (qw(rAlt lAlt rCtrl lCtrl Shft NumL ScrL CapL Enh ? ??))[$_] for 0..10; qq(@o)} use Win32::Console; my $c = Win32::Console->new( STD_INPUT_HANDLE); my @k = qw(T down rep vkey vscan ch ctrl); for (1..20) {my @in = $c->Input; print qq($k[$_]=), ($in[$_] < 0 ? $in[$_] + 256 : $in[$_]), q(; ) for 0..$#in; print(@in ? mode2s $in[-1] : q(empty)); print qq(\n)}"

This installs Win32::Console module (if needed; included with ActiveState Perl)
then reports 20 following console events (press and keep C<Alt> key
to exit by generating a “harmless” chain of events).  B<Limitations:> the reported
input character is not processed (via ToUnicode(); hence chained keys and
multiple chars per key are reported only as low-level), and is reported as
a signed 8-bit integer (so the report for above-8bit characters is
completely meaningless).

  T=1; down=1; rep=1; vkey=65; vscan=30; ch=240; ctrl=9; rAlt lCtrl
  T=1; down=0; rep=1; vkey=65; vscan=30; ch=240; ctrl=9; rAlt lCtrl

This reports single (T=1) events for keypress/keyrelease (down=1/0) of
C<AltGr-a>.  One can see that C<AltGr> generates C<rAlt lCtrl> modifiers
(this is just a transcription of C<ctrl=9>,
that C<a> is on virtual key 65 (this is C<VK_A>) with virtual scancode
30, and that the generated character (it was C<æ>) is C<240>.

The character is approximated to the current codepage.  For example, this is
C<Kana-b> entering C<β = U+03b2> in codepage C<cp1252>:

  T=1; down=1; rep=1; vkey=66; vscan=48; ch=223; ctrl=0;
  T=1; down=0; rep=1; vkey=66; vscan=48; ch=223; ctrl=0;

Note that C<223 = 0xDF>, and C<U+00DF = ß>.  So I<beta> is substituted by
I<eszet>.

There is also a script F<examples/raw_keys_via_api.pl> in this distribution
which does a little
bit more than this.  One can also give this script the argument C<U> (or C<Un>,
where C<n> is the 0-based number among the listed keyboard layouts) to report
ToUnicode() results, or argument C<cooked> to report what is produced by reading raw
charactes (as opposed to events) from the console.

=head2 It is not documented how to make a with-prefix-key(s) combination produce 0-length string

Use C<0000@> (in F<.klc>), or DEADKEY 0 in a F<.c> file.  Explanation: what a prefix key
is doing is making the kernel remember a word (the state of the finite automaton), and not
producing any output character.  Having no prefix key corresponds to the state being 0.

Hence makeing prefix_key=0 is the same as switching the finite automaton to the initial
state, and not producing any character — and this exactly what is requested in the question.

=head2 If data in C<KEYNAME_DEAD> takes too much space, keyboard is mis-installed, and “Language Bar” goes crazy

Installation reports success, the keyboard appears in the list in the Language Bar's "Settings".
But the keyboard is not listed in the menu of the Language Bar itself.  (This is not fixed
by a reboot.)

Deinstalling (by F<MSKLC>'s installer) in such a case removes one (apparently, the last) of the listed keyboards for the language;
at least it is removed from the menu of the Language Bar itself.  However, the list in the “Settings”
does not change!  One can't restore the (wrongly) removed (unrelated!) layout by manipulating the latter list.
(I did not try to check what will happen if only one keyboard for the language is available — is it removed
for good?)  I<This> condition is fixed by a reboot: the “missing” “unrelated” layout jumps to existence.

I did not find a way to restore the deleted keyboard layout (without a reboot).  Experimenting with these is kinda painful:
with each failure,
I add one extra keyboard to the list in the “Settings”; - so the list is growing and growing!  [Better
add useless-to-you keyboards, since until the reboot you will never be able to install them again.]

B<Update:> this condition reappeared in update from v0.61 to v0.63 of B<izKeys> layouts.  Between
these versions, there was
a very small increment of the size: one modification column was added, and two deadkeys were added.
Removing a bunch of (useless?) dead keys descriptions fixed this again; but now I have my doubts on
whether it was due to I<ONLY> increasing the size of C<KEYNAME_DEAD>…  Maybe it is due to the total
size of certain segments in the DLL.

(This may be related to the bug L<"F<kbdutool> places C<KbdTables> at end of the generated F<.c> file">.)

=head2 Windows ignores column=15 of the keybinding definition table

Note that 15 is C<SHFT_INVALID>; this column number is used to indicate that
this particular combination of modifiers does not produce keys.  In particular,
the generator must avoid this column number.

Workaround: put junk into this column, and use different columns for useful modifier
combinations.  The mapping from modifiers to columns should not be necessarily 1-to-1.
(But see L<"F<kbdutool> cannot ignore column=15 of the keybinding definition table">.)

=head2 Windows combines modifier bitmaps for C<lCtrl>, C<Alt> and C<rAlt> on C<AltGr>

(At least when C<AltGr> is special in the keyboard,) the modifier bitmap bound to this
key is actually bit-or of bitmaps above.  Essentially, this prohibits assigning
interesting flag combinations to C<lCtrl>.

The (very limited) workaround is to ensure that the flags one puts on C<AltGr> contain
all the flags assigned to the above VK codes.  (This does not change anything, but
at least makes the assignments less confusing for human inspection.)

=head2 Windows ignores C<lAlt> if its modifier bitmaps is not standard

Adding C<KBDROYA> to C<lAlt> disables console sending non-modified char on keydown.
Together with the previous problem, this looks like essentially prohibiting
putting interesting bitmaps on the left modifier keys.

Workaround: one can add C<KBDKANA> on C<lAlt>.  It looks like the combination
C<KBDALT|KBDKANA> is compatible with Windows' handling of C<Alt> (both in console,
and for accessing/highlighting the menu entries).  (However, since only C<KBDALT>
is going to be stripped for handling of C<lAlt-key>, the modification column for
C<KBDKANA> should duplicate the modification column for no-C<KBD>-flags.  Same with
C<KBDSHIFT> added.)

=head2 When C<AltGr> produces C<ROYA>, problems in Notepad

Going to the Save As dialogue in Notepad loses "speciality of AltGr" (it highlights Menu);
one need to switch layouts via LAlt+LShift to restore.

I do not know any workaround.

=head2 Console applications cannot detect when a keypress may be interpreted as a “command”

The typical logic of an (advanced) application is that it interprets certain keypresses
(combinations of keys with modifiers) as “commands”.  To do this in presence of user-switchable
keyboards, when it is not known in compile time which key sequences generate characters,
the application must be able to find at runtime which keypresses are characters-generating,
and which are not.  The latter keypresses are candidates to be checked whether they should trigger commands
of the application.

For final keypresses of a character-generating key-sequence, an application gets a notification
from the ReadConsoleEvent() API call that this keypress generates a character.  However, for the 
keypresses of the sequence which are non the last one (“dead” keys), there is no such notification.

Therefore, there is no way to avoid dead keys triggering actions in an application.  What is the
difference with non-console applications?  First of all, they get such a notification (with the
standard TranslateMessage()/DispatchMessage() sequence of API calls, on WM_KEYDOWN, one can
PeekMessage() for WM_SYSDEADCHAR/WM_DEADCHAR and/or WM_SYSCHAR/WM_CHAR).  Second, the windowed
application may call ToUnicode(Ex)() to calculate this information itself.

Well, why a console application cannot use the second method?  First, the active keyboard layout
of a console application is the default one.  When user switches the keyboard layout of the console,
the application gets no notification of this, and its keyboard layout does not change.  This makes  
ToUnicode() useless.  Moreover, due to
security architecture, the console application cannot query the ID of the thread serving the message
loop of the console, so cannot query GetKeyboardLayout() of this thread.  Hence ToUnicodeEx() is
useless too.

(There may be a lousy workaround: run ToUnicodeEx() on B<all> the installed keyboard layouts, and
check which of them are excluded by comparing with results of ReadConsoleEvent().  Interpret
contradictions as user changing the keyboard layout.  Of course, on several keypresses following
a change of keyboard layout one may get unexpected results.  And if two similar
keyboards are installed, one may also never get definite answer on which of them is currently active.)

(To handle this workaround, one must have a way to call ToUnicode() in a way which does not change
the internal state of the keyboard driver.  Observe:

=over 4

=item *

Such a way is not documented.

=item *

Watch the character reported by ReadConsoleEvent() on the C<KEYUP> event for deadkeys.  This is
the character which a deadkey would produce if it is pressed twice (and is 0 if pressing it twice
results in a deadkey again).  The only explanation for this I can fathom is that the console's
message queue thread calls such a non-disturbing-state version of ToUnicode().

Why it should be “non-disturbing”?  Otherwise it would reset the state “this deadkey was pressed”,
and the following keypress would be interpreted as not preceded by a deadkey.  And this is not
what happens.  (If one does it with usual ToUnicode() call, DOWN reports a deadkey, but UP reports
“ignored”; to see this, run F<examples/raw_keys_via_api.pl> with arguments C<Un 1> 
with a keyboard which produces ç on C<AltGr-, c>.  Here C<n> is the number of the keyboard in the list
of available keyboards reported by C<examples/raw_keys_via_api.pl U 1>).

Well, when one I<knows> that some API calls are possible, it is just a SMP to find it out
(see F<examples/raw_keys_via_api.pl>).  It turns out that given argument C<wFlags=0x02> achieves
the behaviour of a console during KeyUp event.  (As a side benefit, it also avoids another
glitch in Windows' keyboard processing: it reports the character value in presence of C<Alt>
modifier — recall that ToUnicodeEx() ignores C<Alt> unless C<Ctrl> is present too.  Well, I
checked this so far only on KeyUp event, where console producess mysterious results.)

=item *

However, even without using undocumented flags, it is not hard to construct such a non-disturbing version of ToUnicode().  The only
ingredient needed is a way to reset the state to “no deadkeys pressed” one.  Then just store
keypresses/releases from the time the last such state was found, call ToUnicode(), reset state,
and call ToUnicode() again for all the stored keypresses/releases; then update the stored state
appropriately.

=item *

But I strongly doubt that console's message loop does anything so advanced.  My bet would be that
it uses a non-documented call or non-documented flags.  (Especially since the approach above does
not handle C<Alt> the same way as the console does.)

=back

=head2 In console, which combinations of keypresses may deliver characters?

In addition to the problem outlined in the preceding section, a console application should
better support input of character-by-numeric-code, and of copy-and-pasted strings.  Actually,
the second situation, although undocumented, is well-engineered, so let us document these two
here.  (These two should better be documented together, since pasting may fake input by
repeated character-by-numeric-code.)

Pasting happens character-by-character (more precise, by UTF-16 codepoints), but C<ReadConsoleEvents()>
would group them together:

=over 4

=item *

When pasting a character present in a keyboard layout with at most C<Shift> modifier,
a fully correct emulation of a sequence C<Shift-Press Key-Press Key-Release Shift-Release>
is produced (without C<Shift> if it is not needed).  The character (as usual) is delivered
on both C<Key-Press/Release> events.

=item *

When pasting a character present in a keyboard layout, but needing I<extra> modifiers (not
only C<Shift>), a partial emulation of a certain key tap is produced:
C<rAlt-Press Key-Press Key-Release rAlt-Release>.    The character (as usual) is delivered
on both C<Key-Press/Release> events.

Quirks: first, if C<Shift> is needed, its press/release are not emulated, but the flags on
the C<Key-Press/Release> events indicate presence of a C<Shift>.   Second (by this, the
pasting may be distinguished from “real” keypress), C<lCtrl> press/release are not emulated,
but it is indicated as "present" in flags of all 4 events.

=item *

When pasting control-characters (available via the C<Ctrl(-Shift)>-maps of the layout),
the press/release of C<Ctrl> is not emulated (but the flags indicate C<lCtrl> downs); however,
if C<Shift> is needed, its press/release is emulated (and flags for I<these> events do not
have C<lCtrl> is down).

Pasting C<CR LF> delivers only U+000D (CR) — the typical maps have it on C<Enter> and C<^M>,
and C<Enter> is delivered.

=item *

Otherwise, an emulation of C<lAlt-6-3> is sent, with the C<lAlt-Release> delivering a character:
C<rAlt-Press Key-Press Key-Release Key’-Press Key’-Release lAlt-Release>.  The C<Key Key’>
are very unusual combinations of scancode/vkey for C<6> and C<3> on the numeric keyboard:
they are delivered as if C<NumLock> (or C<Shift>) is down, but the flags indicate that
these modifiers are "not present".

The “honest” C<lAlt-6-3> delivers U+003f, which is "C<?>" (as above, it is delivered on release
of C<lAlt>).

=item *

In general, entering characters-by-numeric-code (entering the decimal — or “KP+” then hex — while
C<Alt> is down) produces the resulting character when C<Alt> is released.  Processing this may create
a significant problem for applications which interpret C<Alt-keypad> as “commands” (e.g., if
they interpret C<Alt-Left> as “word-left”).

There may several work-arounds.  First, usually hex input is much more important than decimal,
and usually, C<Alt-KP_Add> is not bound to commands.  Then the application may ignore characters
delivered on C<Alt-Release> B<unless> the C<Alt-Press> was immediately followed by the press/release
of C<KP_Add>; additionally, it should disable the interpret-as-commands logic while C<Alt> is down,
and its press was followed by press/release of C<KP_Add>.

Second, it is not crucial to deliver Unicode characters numbered in single-digits.  So one may
require that commands are triggered by C<Alt-Numpad> only when pressed one-by-one (releasing
C<Alt> between them), and consider multi-digit presses as input-by-number only.

Finally, Windows aborts entering character-by-numeric-code if any unexpected key press interferes.
For example, C<Alt-6-3> is “C<?>”, but pressing-releasing C<Shift> after pressing down C<Alt>
would not deliver anything.  If an application follows the same logic (in reverse!) when recognizing
keypressing resulting in “commands”, the users would have at least a “technical ability” to enter
both commands, I<AND> enter characters-by-numeric-code.

=back

This is tested I<ONLY> in the situation when a layout has C<KLLF_ALTGR> present, and all the
"with-extra-modifiers" characters are on bitmap entries with C<RMENU> bit marked.  This is
a situation with discussed in the section L<"A convenient assignment of C<KBD*> bitmaps to modifier keys">.

It is plausible that only C<SHIFT>, C<CTRL> and C<ALT> bits in a bitmap returned by C<VkKeyScan()> are
acted upon (with C<Ctrl> flag added based on C<KLLF_ALTGR>).  Some popular keyboard layouts
use C<KANA> bit on the C<rAlt> key; under this assumption, the characters available via C<rAlt> key
would be delivered with at most C<Shift> modifier.

All the emulated events do not have C<NumLock> indicated as "present" in their flags.

=head2 Behaviour of C<Alt-Modifiers-Key> vs C<Modifiers-Key>

When both combinations produce characters (say, X and Y), it is not clear
how an application shouild decide whether it got C<Alt-Y> event (for menu
entry starting with Y), or an C<X> event.

A partial workaround (if the semantic of the layout fits into the limited number
of bits in the ORed mask): make all the keys which may be combined with
C<Alt> to have the C<KBDCTRL> bit in the mask set; add some extra bit
to C<Ctrl> keys to be able to distinguish them.  Then at least the
kernel will produce the correct character on the ToUnicode() call (hence
in TranslateMessage()).  [A potential that an application may be confused
is still large.]

=head2 Customization of what C<CapsLock> is doing is very limited

(See the description of the semantic of C<CapsLock> in L<"Keyboard input on Windows, Part II: The semantic of ToUnicode()">.)

A partial workaround (if the semantic of the layout fits into the limited number
of bits in the ORed mask): make all the modifier combinations (except for the
base layer) to have C<KBDCTRL> and C<KBDALT> bits set; add some extra bits to
C<Ctrl> keys and C<Alt> keys (apparently, only C<KBDKANA> will work with C<Alt>)
to be able to distinguish them.  Then the C<CAPLOKALTGR> flag will affect all
these combinations too.

=head2 C<lCtrl-rCtrl> combination: multiple problems

First of all, sometimes C<Shift> is ignored when used with this combination.
(Fixed by reboot.  When this happens, C<Shift> does not work also with combinations 
with C<lAlt> and/or C<Menu>).  On the
other hand, C<CapsLock> works as intended.  (I even got an impression that
sometimes C<Shift> works when C<CapsLock> is active; cannot reproduce this,
though.)

I suspect this is related to the binding (usually not active) of C<Shift-Ctrl> to switch between
keyboards of a language.  It may have suddently jumped to existence (without my interaction).
Simultaneously, this option disappeared from the UI to change keyboard options
(L<Language Bar/Settings/Advanced Key Settings> in Windows 7).  It might be that 
press/release of C<Shift> is filtered out in presence of C<lCtrl-rCtrl>?  (Looks
like this for C<rightShift> now...)

(I also saw what looks like C<Menu> key being stuck in some rare situations — fixed
by pressing it again.  Do not know how to reproduce this.  It is interesting to
note that one of the bits in the mask of the C<Menu> key is 0x80, and there is
a define for this bit in F<kbd.h> named C<KBDGRPSELTAP> — but it is undocumented,
and, judging by names, one might think that C<KBDGRPSELTAP> would work in pair with the flag
C<GRPSELTAP> of C<VK_TO_WCHARSn->Attributes>.)

B<NOTES:> Apparently, key up/down for many combinations of C<lCtrl+rCtrl+char> are
not delivered to applications.
Key up/down for C<`/5/6/-/=/Z/X/C/V/M/,/./Enter/rShift> are not delivered here when used with C<lCtrl+rCtrl> modifiers
(at least in a console).  Adding C<Shift/lAlt/Menu> does not change this.  Same for C<F1/F2/F8/F9>
and C<Enter/Insert/Delete/Home/PgUp> (but not for keypad ones!).

Moreover, when used with C<KeyPad→> or C<KeyPad*>, this behaves as if both these
keys were pressed.  Same with the pair C<KeyPad-> and C<Keypad+> (is it hardware-dependent???).

(Time to time C<lCtrl+rCtrl+NUMPADchar> do not work — neither with nor without C<NumLock>.)

No workarounds are known.  Although I could reproduce this on 3 physically different
keyboards, this is, most probably, a design defect of hardware keyboards.  Compare with
L<the explanation of problems in diode-less keyboard designs|http://www.dribin.org/dave/keyboard/one_html/> and
L<experiments with 2 Shift keys|http://forums.macrumors.com/threads/hold-down-both-shift-keys-and-type-the-alphabet.230655/>.
Another related tidbit: apparently, L<some hardware keyboard may change the internal layout
after pressing some modifier keys|http://ccm.net/forum/affich-24692-keyboard-mess-up-after-shift-key-held-too-lon?page=2>

=head2 C<lAlt-rAlt> combination: many keys are not delivered to applications

Apparently, key up/down for many combinations of C<lAlt+rAlt+char> are
not delivered to applications.
For example, C<Numpad3> and C<Numpad7> — neither with nor without C<NumLock>; same
for C<G/H/'/B/N/slash> (at least in a console).  Adding C<Shift/lAlt/Menu>
does not change this.  Same for C<F4/F5/F6>.

No workarounds are known (except that C<Numpad3> and C<Numpad7> (without C<NumLock>)
may be replaced by C<Home> and C<PgDown>).

B<NOTE:> in the bottom row of the keyboard, all the keys (except C<lShift>) are
either in the list above, or in the list for C<lCtrl+rCtrl> modifiers.  See also the
references in the discussion of the previous problem (with C<lCtrl+rCtrl>).

=head2 Too long C<DESCRIPTION> of the layout is not shown in Language Bar Settings

(the description is shown in the Language Bar itself).  The examples are (behave the same)

  Greek-QWERTY (Pltn) Grn=⇑␣=^ˡⒶˡ-=Lat; Ripe=Ⓐʳ␣=Mnu-=Rus(Phon); Ripe²=Mnu-^ʳ-=Hbr; k.ilyaz.org
  US-Intl Grn=⇑␣=^ˡⒶˡ-=Grk; Ripe=Ⓐʳ␣=Mnu-=Rus(Phon); Ripe²=Mnu-^ʳ-=Hbr; k.ilyaz.org

(Or maybe it is the semicolons in the names???).  If this happens, one can still assign
distinctive icons to the layout, and distinguish them via going to C<Properties>.

=head1 UNICODE TABLE GOTCHAS

The position of Unicode consortium is, apparently, that the “name” of
a Unicode character is “just an identifier”.  In other words, its
(primary) function is to identify a character uniquely: different
characters should have different names, and that's it.  Any other function
is secondary, and “if it works, fine”; if it does not work, tough luck.
If the name does not match how people use the character (and with the
giant pool of defined characters, this has happened a few times), this is not
a reason to abandon the name.

This position makes the practice of maintaining backward compatibility
easy.  There is L<documentation of obvious errors in the naming|http://unicode.org/notes/tn27/>.

However, this module tries to extract a certain amount of I<orthogonality>
from the giant heap of characters defined in Unicode; the principal concept
is “a mutator”.  Most mutators are defined by programmatic inspection of names 
of characters and relations between names of different characters.  (In other
words, we base such mutators on names, not glyphs.)  Here we 
sketch the irregularities uncovered during this process.

APL symbols with C<UP TACK> and C<DOWN TACK> look reverted w.r.t. other
C<UP TACK> and C<DOWN TACK> symbols.

C<LESS-THAN>, C<FULL MOON>, C<GREATER-THAN>, C<EQUALS> C<GREEK RHO>, C<MALE>
are defined with C<SYMBOL> or C<SIGN> at end, but (may) drop it when combined
with modifiers via C<WITH>.  Likewise for C<SUBSET OF>, C<SUPERSET OF>,
C<CONTAINS AS MEMBER>, C<PARALLEL TO>, C<EQUIVALENT TO>, C<IDENTICAL TO>.

Sometimes opposite happens, and C<SIGN> appears out of blue sky; compare:

  2A18	INTEGRAL WITH TIMES SIGN
  2A19	INTEGRAL WITH INTERSECTION

C<ENG> I<is> a combination of C<n> with C<HOOK>, but it is not marked as such
in its name.

Sometimes a name of diacritic (after C<WITH>) acquires an C<ACCENT> at end
(see C<U+0476>).

Oftentimes the part to the left of C<WITH> is not resolvable: sometimes it
is underspecified (e.g, just C<TRIANGLE>), sometimes it is overspecified
(e.g., in C<LEFT VERTICAL BAR WITH QUILL>), sometime it should be understood
as a glyph-of-written-word (e.g, in C<END WITH LEFTWARDS ARROW ABOVE>).  Sometimes it just
does not exist (e.g., C<LATIN LETTER REVERSED GLOTTAL STOP WITH STROKE> -
there is C<LATIN LETTER INVERTED GLOTTAL STOP>, but not the reversed variant).
Sometimes it is a defined synonym (C<VERTICAL BAR>).

Sometimes it has something appended (C<N-ARY UNION OPERATOR WITH DOT>).

Sometimes C<WITH> is just a clarification (C<RIGHTWARDS HARPOON WITH BARB DOWNWARDS>).

C<SQUARE WITH> specify fill - not combining.  C<FACE> is not combining, same for C<HARPOON>s.

Only C<CIRCLE WITH HORIZONTAL BAR> is combining.  Triangle is combining only with underbar and dot above.

C<TRIANGLE> means C<WHITE UP-POINTING TRIANGLE>.  C<DIAMOND> - C<WHITE DIAMOND> (so do many others.)
C<TIMES> means C<MULTIPLICATION SIGN>; but C<CIRCLED MULTIPLICATION SIGN> means C<CIRCLED TIMES> - go figure!
C<CIRCLED HORIZONTAL BAR WITH NOTCH> is not a decomposition (it is "something circled").

Another way of compositing is C<OVER> (but not C<UNDER>!) and C<FROM BAR>.  See also C<ABOVE>, C<BELOW>
- but only C<BELOW LONG DASH>.  Avoid C<WITH/AND> after these.

C<TWO HEADED> should replace C<TWO-HEADED>.  C<LEFT ARROW> means C<LEFTWARDS ARROW>, same for C<RIGHT>.
C<DIAMOND SHAPE> means C<DIAMOND> - actually just a bug - http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/fv8ao/unicode_600_standard_published/?
C<LINE INTEGRATION> means C<CONTOUR INTEGRAL>.  C<INTEGRAL AVERAGE> means C<INTEGRAL>.
C<SUMMATION> means C<N-ARY SUMMATION>.  C<INFINITY NEGATED> means C<INFINITY>.

C<HEART> means C<WHITE HEART SUIT>.  C<TRIPLE HORIZONTAL BAR> looks genuinely missing...

C<SEMIDIRECT PRODUCT> means one of two, left or right???

This better be convertible by rounding/sharpening mutators, but see

Looking into v6.1 reference PDFs, 2268,2269,2ab5,2ab6,2acb,2acc have two horizontal bars, 
228A,228B,22e4,22e5,2a87,2a88,2ab1,2ab2 have one horizontal bar,  Hence C<BUT NOT EQUAL TO> and C<ABOVE NOT EQUAL TO>
are equivalent; so are C<WITH NOT EQUAL TO>, C<OR NOT EQUAL TO>, C<AND SINGLE-LINE NOT EQUAL TO>
and C<ABOVE SINGLE-LINE NOT EQUAL TO>.  (Square variants come only with one horizontal line?)


Set C<$ENV{UI_KEYBOARDLAYOUT_UNRESOLVED}> to enable warnings.  Then do

    How to contribute:
  http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/XKeyboardConfig/Rules

B<Note:> the problems with handling deadkeys via .Compose are that: .Compose is handled by
applications, while keymaps by server (since they may be on different machines, things can
easily get out of sync); .Compose knows nothing about the current "Keyboard group" or of
the state of CapsLock etc (therefore emulating "group switch" via composing is impossible).

    Console font: Lucida Console 14 is viewable, but has practically no Unicode support.
                  Consolas (good at 16) has much better Unicode support (sometimes better sometimes worse than DejaVue)

=head2 F<.XCompose>: on docs and examples

Syntax of C<.XCompose> is (partially) documented in

  http://www.x.org/archive/current/doc/man/man5/Compose.5.xhtml
  http://cgit.freedesktop.org/xorg/lib/libX11/tree/man/Compose.man

 #   Modifiers are not documented
 #	 (Shift, Alt, Lock, Ctrl with aliases Meta, Caps [Alt/Meta binds Mod1];
 # 	 	 ! means that not mentioned supported modifiers must be off;
#		 None means that all recognizerd modifiers are off.)

Semantic (e.g., which of keybindings has a preference) is not documented.
Experiments (see below) show that a longer binding wins; if same
length, one which is loaded later wins (as far as they match exactly, both
the keys, and the set of required modifiers and their states).
Note that a given keypress may match several I<essentially different> lists of
modifier; one defined earlier wins.

For example, in

    ~Ctrl Shift <a>           : "a1"
    Shift ~Ctrl <a> <b>       : "ab1"
    ~Meta Shift <b>           : "b1"
    ~Ctrl ~Meta Shift <b> <a> : "ba1"
    Shift ~Meta <b>           : "b2"
    Shift ~Meta ~Lock <b>     : "b3"

there is no way to trigger the output C<"a1"> (since the next row captures
essentially the same keypress into a longer binding).  The only binding which
is explicitly overwritten is one for C<"b1">.  Hence pressing
C<Shift-b> would trigger the binding C<"b2">, and there is no way to trigger
the bindings for C<"b3"> and C<"ba1">.

 #      (the source of imLcPrs.c shows that the expansion of the
 #      shorter sequence is stored too - but the presence of
 #      ->succession means that the code to process the resulting
 #      tree ignores the expansion).

The interaction of C<.Compose> with
L<mandatory processing|http://www.x.org/releases/current/doc/kbproto/xkbproto.html#Transforming_the_KeySym_Associated_with_a_Key_Event>
of passed-through C<Control> and C<Lock> modifiers is not documented.

Before the syntax was documented: For the best approximation,
read the parser's code, e.g., google for

    inurl:compose.c XCompose
    site:cgit.freedesktop.org "XCompose"
    site:cgit.freedesktop.org "XCompose" filetype:c
    _XimParseStringFile

    http://cgit.freedesktop.org/xorg/lib/libX11/tree/modules/im/ximcp/imLcIm.c
    http://cgit.freedesktop.org/xorg/lib/libX11/tree/modules/im/ximcp/imLcPrs.c
    http://uim.googlecode.com/svn-history/r6111/trunk/gtk/compose.c
    http://uim.googlecode.com/svn/tags/uim-1.5.2/gtk/compose.c

The actual use of the compiled compose table:

 http://cgit.freedesktop.org/xorg/lib/libX11/tree/modules/im/ximcp/imLcFlt.c

Apparently, the first node (= defined last) in the tree which
matches keysym and modifiers is chosen.  So to override C<< <Foo> <Bar> >>,
looks like (checked to work!) C<< ~Ctrl <Foo> >> may be used...
On the other hand, defining both C<< <Foo> <Bar> <Baz> >> and (later) C<< <Foo> ~Ctrl <Bar> >>,
one would expect that C<< <Foo> <Ctrl-Bar> <Baz> >> should still trigger the
expansion of C<< <Foo> <Bar> <Baz> >> — but it does not...  See also:

  http://cgit.freedesktop.org/xorg/lib/libX11/tree/modules/im/ximcp/imLcLkup.c

The file F<.XCompose> is processed by X11 I<clients> on startup.  The changes
to this file should be seen immediately by all newly started clients
(but GTK or QT applications may need extra config - see below)
unless the directory F<~/.compose-cache> is present and has a cache
file compatible with binary architecture (then until cache
expires - one day after creation - changes are not seen).  The
name F<.XCompose> may be overriden by environment variable C<XCOMPOSEFILE>. 

To get (better?) examples, google for C<"multi_key" partial alpha "DOUBLE-STRUCK">.

  # include these first, so they may be overriden later
  include "%H/my-Compose/.XCompose-kragen"
  include "%H/my-Compose/.XCompose-ootync"
  include "%H/my-Compose/.XCompose-pSub"

Check success: kragen: C<\ space> --> ␣; ootync: C<o F> --> ℉; pSub: C<0 0> --> ∞ ...

Older versions of X11 do not understand %L %S. - but understand %H
    
E.g. Debian Squeeze 6.0.6; according to
      
   http://packages.debian.org/search?keywords=x11-common
    
it has C<v 1:7.5+8+squeeze1>).

   include "/etc/X11/locale/en_US.UTF-8/Compose"
   include "/usr/share/X11/locale/en_US.UTF-8/Compose"

Import default rules from the system Compose file:
usually as above (but supported only on newer systems):

   include "%L"

detect the success of the lines above: get C<#> by doing C<Compose + +> ...

The next file to include have been generated by

  perl -wlne 'next if /#\s+CIRCLED/; print if />\s+<.*>\s+<.*>\s+<.*/' /usr/share/X11/locale/en_US.UTF-8/Compose
  ### Std tables contain quadruple prefix for GREEK VOWELS and CIRCLED stuff

The following exerpt from NEO compose tables may be good if you use
keyboards which do not generate dead keys, but may generate Cyrillic keys;
in other situations, edit filtering/naming on the following download
command and on the C<include> line below.  (For my taste, most bindings are
useless since they contain keysymbols which may be generated with NEO, but
not with less intimidating keylayouts.)

(Filtering may be important, since having a large file may
significantly slow down client's startup (without F<~/.compose-cache>???).)

=head1 LIMITATIONS

Currently only output for Windows keyboard layout drivers (via MSKLC) is available.

Currently only the keyboards with US-mapping of hardware keys to "the etched
symbols" are supported (think of German physical keyboards where Y/Z keycaps
are swapped: Z is etched between T and U, and Y is to the left of X, or French
which swaps A and Q, or French or Russian physical keyboards which have more
alphabetical keys than 26).

While the architecture of assembling a keyboard of small easy-to-describe
pieces is (IMO) elegant and very powerful, and is proven to be useful, it 
still looks like a collection of independent hacks.  Many of these hacks
look quite similar; it would be great to find a way to unify them, so 
reduce the repertoir of operations for assembly.

The current documentation of the module’s functionality is not complete.

The implementation of the module is crumbling under its weight.  Its 
evolution was by bloating (even when some design features were simplified).
Since initially I had very little clue to which level of abstraction and 
flexibility the keyboard description would evolve, bloating accumulated 
to incredible amounts.

=head1 TODO

UniPolyK-MultiSymple

Multiple linked faces (accessible as described in ChangeLog); designated 
Primary- and Secondary- switch keys (as Shift-Space and AltGr-Space now).

C<Soft hyphen> as a deadkey may be not a good idea: following it by a special key
(such as C<Shift-Tab>, or C<Control-Enter>) may insert the deadkey character???
Hence the character should be highly visible... (Now the key is invisible,
so this is irrelevant...)

Currently linked layers must have exactly the same number of keys in VK-tables.

VK tables for TAB, BACK were BS.  Same (remains) for the rest of unusual keys...  (See TAB-was.)
But UTOOL cannot handle them anyway...

Define an extra element in VK keys: linkable.  Should be sorted first in the kbd map,
and there should be the same number in linked lists.  Non-linkable keys should not
be linked together by deadkey access...

Interaction of FromToFlipShift with SelectRX not intuitive.  This works: Diacritic[<sub>](SelectRX[[0-9]](FlipShift(Latin)))

DefinedTo cannot be put on Cyrillic 3a9 (yo to superscript disappears - due to duplication???).

... so we do it differently now, but: LinkLayer was not aggressively resolving all the occurences of a character on a layer
before we started to combine it with Diacritic_if_undef...  - and Cyrillic 3a9 is not helped...

via_parent() is broken - cannot replace for Diacritic_if_undef.

Currently, we map ephigraphic letters to capital letters - is it intuitive???

dotted circle ◌ 25CC

DeadKey_Map200A=	FlipLayers
#DeadKey_Map200A_0=	Id(Russian-AltGr)
#DeadKey_Map200A_1=	Id(Russian)
  performs differently from the commented variant: it adds links to auto-filled keys...

Why ¨ on THIN SPACE inserts OGONEK after making ¨ multifaceted???

When splitting a name on OVER/BELOW/ABOVE, we need both sides as modifiers???

Ỳ currently unreachable (appears only in Latin-8 Celtic, is not on Wikipedia)

Somebody is putting an extra element at the end of arrays for layers???  - Probably SPACE...

Need to treat upside-down as a pseudo-decomposition.

We decompose reversed-smallcaps in one step - probably better add yet another two-steps variant...

When creating a <pseudo-stuff> treat SYMBOL/SIGN/FINAL FORM/ISOLATED FORM/INITIAL FORM/MEDIAL FORM;
note that SIGN may be stripped: LESS-THAN SIGN becomes LESS-THAN WITH DOT

We do not do canonical-merging of diacritics; so one needs to specify VARIA in addition to GRAVE ACCENT.

We use a smartish algorithm to assign multiple diacritics to the same deadkey.  A REALLY smart algorithm
would use information about when a particular precombined form was introduced in Unicode...

AltGrMap should be made CapsLock aware (impossible: smart capslock works only on the first layer, so
the dead char must be on the first layer).  [May work for Shift-Space - but it has a bag of problems...]

Alas, CapsLock'ing a composition cannot be made stepwise.  Hence one must calculate it directly.
(Oups, Windows CapsLock is not configurable on AltGr-layer.  One may need to convert
it to VK_KANA???)

WarnConflicts[exceptions] and NoConflicts translation map parsing rules.

Need a way to map to a different face, not a different layer.

Vietnamese: to put second accent over ă, ơ (o/horn), put them over ae/oe; - including 
another ˘ which would "cancel the implied one", so will get o-horn itself.  - Except
for acute accent which should replaced by ¨, and hook must be replaced by ˆ.  (Over ae/oe
there is only macron and diaeresis over ae.)

Or: for the purpose of taking a second accent, AltGr-A behaves as Ă (or Â?), AltGr-O 
behaves as Ô (or O-horn Ơ?).  Then Å and O/ behave as the other one...  And ˚ puts the
dot *below*, macron puts a hook.  Exception: ¨ acts as ´ on the unaltered AE.

  While Å takes acute accent, one can always input it via putting ˚ on Á.

If Ê is on the keyboard (and macron puts a hook), then the only problem is how to enter
a hook alone (double circumflex is not precombined), dot below (???), and accents on u-horn ư.

Mogrification rules for double accents: AE Å OE O/ Ù mogrify into hatted/horned versions; macron
mogrifies into a hook; second hat modifies a hat into a horn.  The only problem: one won't be 
able to enter double grave on U - use the OTHER combination of ¨ and `...  And how to enter
dot below on non-accented aue?  Put ¨ on umlaut? What about Ë?

To allow . or , on VK_DECIMAL: maybe make CapsLock-dependent?

  http://blogs.msdn.com/b/michkap/archive/2006/09/13/752377.aspx

How to write this diacritic recipe: insert hacheck on AltGr-variant, but only if
the breve on the base layer variant does not insert hacheck (so inserts breve)???

Sorting diacritics by usefulness: we want to apply one of accents from the
given list to a given key (with l layers of 2 shift states).  For each accent,
we have 2l possible variants for composition; assign to 2 variants differing
by Shift the minimum penalty of the two.  For each layer we get several possible
combinations of different priority; and for each layer, we have a certain number
of slots open.  We can redistribute combinations from the primary layer to
secondary one, but not between secondary layers.

Work with slots one-by-one (so that the assignent is "monotinic" when the number
of slots increases).  Let m be the number of layers where slots are present.
Take highest priority combinations; if the number of "extra" combinations
in the primary layer is at least m, distribute the first m of them to
secondary layers.  If n<m of them are present, fill k layers which
have no their own combinations first, then other n-k layers.  More precisely,
if n<=k, use the first n of "free" layers; if n>k, fill all free layers, then
the last n-k of non-free layers.

Repeat as needed (on each step, at most one slot in each layer appears).

But we do not need to separate case-differing keys!  How to fix?

All done, but this works only on the current face!  To fix, need to pass
to the translator all the face-characters present on the given key simultaneously.

  ===== Accent-key TAB accesses extra bindinges (including NUM->numbered one)
	(may be problematic with some applications???
	 -- so duplicate it on + and @ if they is not occupied
	 -- there is nothing related to AT in Unicode)

Diacritics_0218_0b56_0c34=	May create such a thing...
 (0b56_0c34 invisible to the user).

  Hmm - how to combine penaltized keys with reversion?  It looks like
  the higher priority bindings would occupy the hottest slots in both
  direct and reverse bindings...

  Maybe additional forms Diacrtitics2S_* and Diacrtitics2E_* which fight
  for symbols of the same penalty from start and from end (with S winning
  on stuff exactly in the middle...).  (The E-form would also strip the last |-group.)

' Shift-Space (from US face) should access the second level of Russian face.
To avoid infinite cycles, face-switch keys to non-private faces should be
marked in each face... 

"Acute makes sharper" is applicable to () too to get <>-parens...

Another ways of combining: "OR EQUAL TO", "OR EQUIVALENT TO", "APL FUNCTIONAL
SYMBOL QUAD", "APL FUNCTIONAL SYMBOL *** UNDERBAR", "APL FUNCTIONAL SYMBOL *** DIAERESIS".

When recognizing symbols for GREEK, treat LUNATE (as NOP).  Try adding HEBREW LETTER at start as well...

Compare with: 8 basic accents: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_reference_alphabet (English 78)

When a diacritic on a base letter expands to several variants, use them all 
(with penalty according to the flags).

Problem: acute on acute makes double acute modifier...

Penalized letter are temporarily completely ignored; need to attach them in the end... 
 - but not 02dd which should be completely ignore...

Report characters available on diacritic chains, but not accessible via such chains.
Likewise for characters not accessible at all.  Mark certain chains as "Hacks" so that
they are not counted in these lists.

Long s and "preceded by" are not handled since the table has its own (useless) compatibility decompositions.

=head2 Implementation details

Since the C<FullFace[FNAME]> accessor may have different effects at different moment of
a face C<FNAME> synthesis, here is the order in which C<FullFace[FNAME]> changes:

  ini_layers:   essentially, contains what is given in the key “layers” of the face recipe
	Later, a version of these layers with exportable keys marked is created as ini_layers_prefix.
  ini_filled_layers: adds extra (fake) keys containing control characters and created via-VK-keys
	  (For these extended layers, the previous version can be inspected via ini_copy1.)
	(created when exportable keys are handled.)

The next modification is done not by modifying the list of names of layers
associated to the face, but by editing the corresponding layers in place.
(The unmodified version of layer, one containing the exportable keys, is
accessible via C<ini_copy>.)  On this step one adds the missing characters via
from the face specified in the C<LinkFace> key.

	WRONG!!!  Need different multipliers for next and for output; so need 256 individual declarations
	Instead: use multiplier="4" (so that the output char is correct; next state takes 4K values, out of which we
	need only last two bits (manually inserted via next="" above); so we need 1K declarations for per-ultimate???

	So: maybe have 16 declarations for "After +0yz or +10z"; this way, next state takes 64 values, of which
	we may make account for by 16 declarations.  (32 total per 22 chars 0-9a-fA-F.)

	Or: maybe have 16 declarations for "After +0yz or +10z"; each creates a range of 64 possible "next" states;
	but we create 4 groups of such states.  So we may make account for by 4 declarations.  (20 total per 22 chars 0-9a-fA-F.)
