The woodgrain-01.jpg has been taken from the JiGo 2.1.1 distribution and
later modified.

The stone graphics were captured from cgoban1, which creates them
algorithmically in a very pleasant manner, and then enhanced with The
Gimp. I should just rip the algorithm, but the enhancement step is
difficult to automate ;)

Sounds here were taken from opie, imaze and gnome-audio (and modified),
with additional goban sounds by Robin Redeker.
