NAME
    Devel::PL_origargv - access to the Perl interpreter's argv

SYNOPSIS
            my @PL_origargv = Devel::PL_origargv->get;

DESCRIPTION
    If Perl is run with the following command:

            perl -w -Ilib yourscript.pl arg1 arg2

    Then @ARGV will be pre-populated with `arg1` and `arg2`, and $0 will
    reflect the name of your script, but there's no way to access `-w` or
    `-Ilib`.

    This module provides one class method that returns Perl's original argv
    array as a list.

    `get`
        Returns argv as a list of strings. If called in scalar context,
        returns argc (i.e. the count of argv).

CAVEATS
    This module's test suite will not pass when run via `forkprove`. Use the
    standard `prove` instead.
