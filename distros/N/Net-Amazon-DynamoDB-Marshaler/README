NAME

    Net::Amazon::DynamoDB::Marshaler - Translate Perl hashrefs into
    DynamoDb format and vice versa.

SYNOPSIS

      use Net::Amazon::DynamoDB::Marshaler;
    
      my $item = {
        name => 'John Doe',
        age => 28,
        skills => ['Perl', 'Linux', 'PostgreSQL'],
      };
    
      # Translate a Perl hashref into DynamoDb format
      my $item_dynamodb = dynamodb_marshal($item);
    
      # $item_dynamodb looks like:
      # {
      #   name => {
      #     S => 'John Doe',
      #   },
      #   age => {
      #     N => 28,
      #   },
      #   skills => {
      #     SS => ['Perl', 'Linux', 'PostgreSQL'],
      #   }
      # };
    
      # Translate a DynamoDb formatted hashref into regular Perl
      my $item2 = dynamodb_unmarshal($item_dynamodb);

DESCRIPTION

    AWS' DynamoDB <http://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/> service expects
    attributes in a somewhat cumbersome format in which you must specify
    the attribute type as well as its name and value(s). This module
    simplifies working with DynamoDB by abstracting away the notion of
    types and letting you use more intuitive data structures.

    There are a handful of CPAN modules which provide a DynamoDB client
    that do similar conversions. However, in all of these cases the
    conversion is tightly bound to the client implementation. This module
    exists in order to decouple the functionality of formatting with the
    functionality of making AWS calls.

    NOTE: this module does not yet support Binary or Binary Set types. Pull
    requests welcome.

CONVERSION RULES

    See <the AWS
    documentation|http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/HowItWorks.NamingRulesDataTypes.html#HowItWorks.DataTypes>
    for more details on the various types supported by DynamoDB.

    For a given Perl value, we use the following rules to pick the DynamoDB
    type:

      1. If the value is undef or an empty string, use Null ('NULL').

      2. If the value is a number (per StrictNum in Types::Standard), and
      falls within the accepted range for a DynamoDB number, use Number
      ('N').

      3. For any other non-reference, use String ('S').

      4. If the value is an arrayref, use List ('L').

      5. If the value is a hashref, use Map ('M').

      6. If the value isa boolean, use Boolean ('BOOL').

      7. If the value isa Set::Object, use either Number Set ('NS') or
      String Set ('SS'), depending on whether all members are numbers or
      not. All members must be defined, non-reference values, or an error
      will be thrown.

      8. Any other value will throw an error.

    When doing the opposite - un-marshalling a hashref fetched from
    DynamoDB - the module applies the rules above in reverse. Please note
    that NULLs get unmarshalled as undefs, so an empty string will be
    re-written to undef if it goes through a marshal/unmarshal cycle.
    DynamoDB does not allow for a way to store empty strings as distinct
    from NULL.

EXPORTS

    By default, dynamodb_marshal and dynamodb_unmarshal are exported.

 dynamodb_marshal

    Takes in a "normal" Perl hashref, transforms it into DynamoDB format.

      my $attrs_marshalled = dynamodb_marshal($attrs[, force_type => {}]);

  force_type

    Sometimes you want to explicitly choose a type for an attribute,
    overridding the rules above. Most commonly this issue occurs for key
    attributes, as DynamoDB enforces consistent typing on these attributes
    that it doesn't enforce otherwise.

    For instance, you might have a table named 'users' whose partition key
    is a string named 'username'. If you have incoming data with a username
    of '1234', this module will tell DynamoDB to store that as a number,
    which will result in an error.

    Use force_type in that situation:

      my $item = {
          username => '1234',
          ...
      };
    
      my $force_type = {
          username => 'S',
      };
    
      my $item_dynamodb = dynamodb_marshal($item, force_type => $force_type);
    
      # $item_dynamodb looks like:
      # {
      #   username => {
      #     S => '1234',
      #   },
      #   ...
      # };

    You can only specify 'S' or 'N' for force_type values. If the attribute
    you specify is a list or map, the forced type will be applied
    recursively through the data structure. Sets are not currently
    available for force_type.

    Undefs or empty string values for force_type attributes will be removed
    from the marshalled hashref. While this behavior might not seem
    intuitive at first, it's almost certainly what you want. For instance,
    if you have a global secondary index on a string attribute, and your
    item has an undef value for that attribute, you want to avoid sending
    that attribute (using NULL would be rejected by DynamoDB, and you can't
    send empty strings). If you have an undef value for a primary key
    string attribute, you have a bug in your application somewhere.

    If you specify 'N', and a non-number value is encountered, it will also
    be removed.

 dynamodb_unmarshal

    The opposite of dynamodb_marshal.

      my $attrs = dynamodb_unmarshal($attrs_marshalled);
