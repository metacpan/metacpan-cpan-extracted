=head1 NAME

Image::DS9 - interface to the DS9 image display and analysis program

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Image::DS9;

  $dsp = new Image::DS9;
  $dsp = new Image::DS9( \%attrs );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class provides access to the B<DS9> image display and analysis
program through its B<XPA> access points.

B<DS9> is a rather flexible and feature-rich image display program.
Rather than extol its virtues, please consult the website in
L</REQUIREMENTS>.

While one could communicate with B<DS9> solely via the B<IPC::XPA>
class, this class provides a cleaner, less error prone interface,
as it checks the passed commands and arguments for syntax and data
type.  It also cleans up returned data from B<DS9>.

To use this class, first construct a B<Image::DS9> object, and
then apply its methods.  It is possible to both address more
than one B<DS9> with a single object, as well as having
multiple B<Image::DS9> objects communicate with their own
B<DS9> invocations.  Eventually there will be documentation
spelling out how to do this.


=head1 METHODS

The methods in this class closely follow the XPA access points.  The
documentation here tries to cover the mechanics of calling the
methods. For more information on what the methods do, or how the
arguments affect things, please consult the B<DS9> documentation.

=head2 Arguments

Commands sent to DS9 are sent as strings.  Many of the option strings
are available as Perl constants.  See L</Constants> for more details.

=head2 Boolean values

Some methods take boolean values; these may be the strings C<on>, C<off>,
C<yes>, C<no>, or the integers C<1> or C<0>.

=head2 Return Values

Because a single B<Image::DS9> object may communicate with multiple
instances of B<DS9>, queries may return more than one value.
Because one usually communicates with a single B<DS9> instance,
if a query is made in scalar mode, the result is returned as a scalar,
i.e.:

	$cmap = $dsp->cmap();

In this mode, if more than one server responds, you'll get the
results for a randomly chosen server.  Some commands, in particular
some of the options to the C<fits>, will return a scalar reference
in called in scalar mode, as the returned data may be large, and it
makes no sense to have multiple copies of the data floating about.
These commands are documented below.

If a return value is multi-valued, a query in scalar context yields a
reference to an array, not a scalar.  For instance:

	$res = $dsp->bin( 'about' );
	($x, $y ) = @$res;

returns a reference to an array, while

	$res = $dsp->bin( 'buffersize' );

returns a scalar.  Don't attempt to do

	($x, $y ) = $dsp->bin( 'about' ); # ERROR DON"T DO THIS

as it will return a full blown hash as documented next.

When queries are made in list mode, the return values are hashes,
rather than scalars.  The hash has as keys the names of the servers,
with the values being references to hashes with the keys C<name>,
C<buf> and C<message>.  The C<message> element is present if there was
an error. The C<buf> element contains the results of a query.

For example,

	use Data::Dumper;
	%cmaps = $dsp->cmap;
	print Dumper \%cmaps;

yields

	$VAR1 = {
	         'DS9:ds9 838e2ab4:32832' =>
	          {
	            'name' => 'DS9:ds9 838e2ab4:32832',
	            'buf' => 'Grey'
	          }
	        };

Ordinarily, the C<buf> element will be unaltered (except for the
removal of trailing newlines) from what B<DS9> outputs.  For
multi-valued return results, C<buf> is set to an array containing
the values:

	use Data::Dumper;
	%res = $dsp->bin( 'about' );
	print Dumper \%res;

	$VAR1 = {
	         'DS9:ds9 838e2ab4:32832' =>
	          {
	            'name' => 'DS9:ds9 838e2ab4:32832',
	            'buf' => [ 20, 30 ],
	          }
	        };

Sending data doesn't result in a return value.


=head2 Error Returns

In case of error, an exception is thrown via B<croak()>.  The B<res()>
method will return a hash, keyed off of the servers' names.  For each
server which had an error, the hash value will be a reference to a
hash containing the keys C<name> and C<message>; the latter will
contain error information.  For those commands which return data, and
for those servers which did not have an error, the C<buf> key will be
available.

=head2 Administrative Methods

=over 8

=item new

  $dsp = new Image::DS9;
  $dsp = new Image::DS9( \%attrs );

Construct a new object.  It returns a handle to the object.  It throws
an exception (catch via B<eval>) upon error.

The optional hash B<attrs> may contain one of the following keys:

=over 8

=item Server

An alternate server to which to communicate.  It defaults to C<ds9>.

=item WaitTimeOut

The default number of seconds that the B<wait()> method should
try to contact B<DS9> servers.

=item max_servers

The maximum number of servers to which to communicate.  It defaults to
the number of C<DS9> servers running at the time the constructor is
called.

=item min_servers

The minimum number of servers which should respond to commands.  If
a response is not received from at least this many servers, an exception
will be thrown.  It defaults to C<1>.

=item ResErrCroak

If true, queries sent to B<ds9> which returns fewer values than
expected will result in B<croak()>s.  This may be a problem if B<ds9>
is queried for inappropriate information. For example, it will return
an empty result if a image (i.e. not a binned event list) is displayed
in the current frame and the names of the binned columns are queried
(which of course makes no sense).  See the C<ResErrWarn> and
C<ResErrIgnore> attributes for ways of handling this.

If too I<many> results are returned, this module will always croak.
B<ResErrCroak> is the default mode.

=item ResErrWarn

If true, queries sent to B<ds9> which returns fewer values than
expected will result in B<carp()>s and will be compensated for by
filling in the missing values with empty strings.

=item ResErrIgnore

Queries sent to B<ds9> which returns fewer values than expected are
silently compensated for by filling in the missing values with
empty strings.

=back

For example,

	$dsp = new Image::DS9( { max_servers => 3 } );


=item nservers

  $nservers = $dsp->nservers;

This returns the number of servers which the object is communicating
with.

=item res

  %res = $dsp->res;

In case of error, the returned results from the failing B<XPA> call
are available via this method.  It returns a hash, keyed off of the
server signature(s). See the B<IPC::XPA> documentation for more
information on what the hashes contain.

=item wait

  $dsp->wait();
  $dsp->wait($timeout);

Try to contact the B<DS9> servers, and wait until at least
B<min_servers> have replied.  It will attempt this for
B<WaitTimeOut> seconds if no timeout is supplied, else
the given time.  It returns true upon success.  This routine
is useful for doing things like:

  $dsp = new Image::DS9;
  unless ( $dsp->nservers )
  {
    system("ds9 &" );
    $dsp->wait() or die( "unable to connect to DS9\n" );
  }

=back


=head2 Control Methods

Most methods exactly parallel the B<DS9> B<XPA> commands.  In general
each element in a command is passed as a separate argument to the
method.  For example, to change the binning factor:

	 $dsp->bin( factor => 0.2 );

Some commands have more arguments:

	$dsp->bin( smooth => function => 'boxcar' );
	$dsp->bin( smooth => radius => 33 );
	$dsp->bin( about => ( 3, 3 ) );
	$dsp->bin( cols => ( 'rt_x', 'rt_y' ) );

Note the use of the C<=E<gt>> operator to force preceding barewords to be
treated as strings, and the frivolous use of extra parenthesis for
aesthetics.  Some arguments are concatenated to avoid confusion; see
the documentation for the individual methods.

Some commands can query B<DS9> for state information as well as set it.
For example,

        $function = $dsp->bin( smooth => function );

B<Image::DS9> differentiates between the setting and requesting of
values by the presence or absence of the argument containing the information.

Some commands take a hash as their last argument, which contains
attributes which are passed on to B<DS9>.

True Boolean values may be one of the following:  C<1>, C<yes>, C<true>.
False Boolean values may be one of the following:  C<0>, C<no>,
C<false>.  Boolean values returned by a command are always translated
into either C<0> or C<1>.

The documentation for the commands lists the options supported and
any deviations from the general approach described above.  Refer
to the B<DS9> B<XPA> documentation to determine which commands permit
queries and the allowed data types for the arguments.  B<Image::DS9>
checks that all data passed to B<DS9> is of the appropriate type.


The documentation which follows uses doubled square brackets to
indicate an optional argument.

=over 8

=item array

  $dsp->array( $image, [[ \%attrs ]]);

This is a interface to the B<array> access point, which displays
images.  C<$image> may be a PDL object, a scalar, or a scalar
reference.  If it is a PDL object, all required information is
extracted from it, and it is passed to B<DS9>.  Otherwise, it should
be binary data suitable for B<DS9>, and the B<attrs> hash should be
used to pass dimensional and size data to B<DS9>.  B<attrs> may
contain the following elements:

=over 8

=item xdim

The X coordinate array extent.

=item ydim

The Y coordinate array extent.

=item bitpix

The number of bits per pixel.  Negative values indicate a floating point
number (similar to the B<FITS> standard).

=back

=item bin

The following options are supported:

C<about>,
C<buffersize>,
C<cols>,
C<factor>,
C<filter>,
C<function>,
C<average>,
C<sum>,
C<to fit> or C<tofit>

=item blink

To query the whether blink is on:

   $is_blink_on = $dsp->blink( 'state' );

To turn blink on:

   $dsp->blink;

=item cd

  $dsp->cd( $dir );
  $dir = $dsp->cd;

=item cmap

The following options are supported:

C<file>,
C<invert>,
C<value>.

To query the current colormap,

   $cmap = $dsp->cmap;

=item contour

The following options are supported:

C<copy>,
C<paste>,
C<save>.

To turn contouring on or off:

   $dsp->contour( $boolean_value );

To query the state of contouring:

   $is_contour_on = $dsp->contour;

=item crosshair

  $dsp->crosshair( [[x, y, <coordinate system>, [[<sky frame>]],
                                               [[<sky format>]] ]] );
  $coords = $dsp->crosshair( [[<coordinate system>,
                        [[<sky frame>]], [[<sky format>]] ]] );
  ($x, $y ) = @$coords

To query the position, pass no coordinates to the method.  The
return value is multi-valued.

=item cursor

  $dsp->cursor( $x, $y );

Set the cursor position to the given position.

=item dss

The following options are supported:

C<name>
C<coord>
C<server>
C<survey>
C<size>

When queried, some of the options may return more than one value.  In
those cases, a query yields a reference to an array, not a scalar.
For instance:

	$res = $dsp->dss( 'coord' );
	($x, $y ) = @$res;

returns a reference to an array, while

	$res = $dsp->dss( 'server' );

returns a scalar.  Don't attempt to do

	($x, $y ) = $dsp->dss( 'coord' ); # ERROR DON"T DO THIS

As it will return a full blown hash as documented in L</Return Values>.

=item exit

No options, just the grand finale.


=item file

return the current file name loaded for the current frame:

  $dsp->file( $file );

Save the frame as a file:

  $dsp->file( 'save', [[<save options>>,]] $file );

Display the specified C<$file>.

  $dsp->file( [[<type>]], $file, [[\%attrs]] );

The supported options are:

C<orientation>,
C<pagescale>,
C<pagesize>.

They may be queried by specifying no argument.

=item pan

To set the pan position:

  $dsp->pan( [[<type>,]] $x, $y,

C<shape>,
C<color>,
C<width>,
C<source>,
C<background>,
C<include>,
C<exclude>,
C<selected>.

To query the state of options which are subject to query, don't
pass a value for the option (just the option name).

To send B<DS9> a region, pass B<regions> a scalar or scalar ref:

  $dsp->regions( $region );

To query the current list of regions and receive the results using
the current attribute formats,

  $regions = $dsp->regions();


Alternatively, one can request a different attribute format directly
in the query by passing a hash reference with the following available
keys: C<-format>, C<-system>, C<-sky>, C<-skyformat>, C<-strip>.

  $regions = $dsp->regions( \%attr );

=item rotate

  $rotate = $dsp->rotate;	  # query current angle
  $dsp->rotate( abs => $angle );  # absolute

  $dsp->rotate( $angle );         # relative


=item saveas

The following options are supported:

C<jpeg>,
C<tiff>,
C<png>,
C<ppm>.

=item scale

The following options are supported:

C<datasec>,
C<limits>,
C<mode>,
C<scope>.

To query the state of the options, don't pass a value for the option.
A query of C<limits> returns an array ref, as it is multi-valued.


=item single

To query the whether single mode is set:

   $is_single_on = $dsp->single( 'state' );

To turn single mode on:

   $dsp->single;


=item source

Just use the source, Luke.

=item tcl

Nothing special here, move along.

=item tile

The following options are supported:

C<mode>,
C<grid>,
C<grid> C<mode>,
C<grid> C<layout>,
C<grid> C<gap>,
C<row>,
C<column>.

To specify grid modes, layout and gap, do this:

  $dsp->tile( grid => mode => 'automatic' );

To turn tiling on or off,

  $dsp->tile( $boolean ).

To query tiling state, either

  $state = $dsp->tile;
  $state = $dsp->tile( 'state' ); # same as blink and single

To query those options that support query, don't pass a value for the option.
Note that a query of the grid layout will return an arrayref.


=item update

The now option is passed via a hash:

  $dsp->update( { now => 1 } );

=item version

Queries and returns B<DS9>'s version.

=item view

Supported options are:

C<layout>,
C<info>,
C<panner>,
C<magnifier>,
C<buttons>,
C<colorbar>,
C<graph>,
C<filename>,
C<object>,
C<minmax>,
C<lowhigh>,
C<frame>,
C<image>,
C<physical>,
C<wcs>,
C<wcsa>..C<wcsz>.
C<red>,
C<green>,
C<blue>

=item vo

All aboard!

=item wcs

The options supported are:

C<wcs>, C<wcsa>..C<wcsz>,
C<system>,
C<sky>,
C<skyformat>,
C<align>,
C<reset>
C<replace>,
C<append>,
C<replace>,
C<append>.

The C<replace> and C<append> options may take either the C<file>
option (followed by a filename)

  $dsp->wcs( replace => file => $filename );

or a scalar, scalar ref, hash ref, or array ref containing a WCS specification:

  $dsp->wcs( replace => \%wcs ).
  $dsp->wcs( replace => \@wcs ).
  $dsp->wcs( replace => $wcs ).
  $dsp->wcs( replace => \$wcs ).

If it is scalar, the scalar should hold the WCS record.  If it is a hash
reference, a WCS record is constructed from the keys and values.  If
it is an array reference, the record is constructed by appending a
newline to each array value and concatenating the resultant strings.

Query the appropriate options by not passing a value for the option.

=item web

Set (or query) the web address in B<DS9>'s built in browser.

=item width

  $dsp->width( $width );
  $width = $dsp->width;

=item zoom

  $zoom = $dsp->zoom;          # query
  $dsp->zoom( to => $zoom );   # absolute
  $dsp->zoom( abs => $zoom );  # absolute
  $dsp->zoom( rel => $zoom );  # relative
  $dsp->zoom( $zoom );         # relative
  $dsp->zoom(0);               # zoom to fit
  $dsp->zoom('tofit');         # zoom to fit
  $dsp->zoom('to', 'fit');     # zoom to fit

=item Set

  $dsp->Set( $cmd, $buf )

Send an arbitrary XPA Set command to the DS9 server.  If there was an
error sending the command to the server, or fewer than expected
servers responded, it'll B<croak()>.  Messages from the server will be
made available via the B<res()> method.  See IPC::XPA for more
information on the format of those messages.

=item Get

  %results = $dsp->Get( $cmd )

Send an arbitrary XPA Get command to the DS9 Server.   If there was an
error sending the command to the server, or fewer than expected
servers responded, it'll B<croak()>.  Messages from the server will be
made available via the B<res()> method.

Upon success, it'll return the results of the command.  If called in
scalar mode, it'll return just one result (if there is more than one
server, it returns results from an arbitrary server). In array mode,
It'll return a hash, with the hash keys being the names of the server.
The hash values are themselves references to hashes containing
the results, with a key of C<buf>.

=back

=head2 Constants

Many of the options which must be passed as strings to the command
methods are available as Perl constants.  This provides a way for Perl
to verify the strings at compile time, rather than run time.  For
example,

  $ds9->regions( 'resett' );

will be caught at run time, while

  $ds9->regions( _resett );

will be caught at compile time.  There are some places where Perl
will get confused as to whether you are using a constant or a string.
For example, assume there's a constant named C<_mode>:

  $ds9->tile( _mode => 'grid' );

Because of the C<=E<gt>> operator, C<_mode> will be turned into the
string C<_mode>, rather than being identified as the constant B<_mode>,
which presumably will resolve into the string C<mode>.  To avoid this,
use the C<,> operator:

  $ds9->tile( _mode, 'grid' );

There are two ways to get to the constants:
B<Image::DS9::OldConstants> and B<Image::DS9::Constants>.  The former
is the older deprecated way, which groups the constants by command and
uses a group specific prefix to make the constants unique.  This is
confusing, as one has to remember all of the prefixes.

The new arrangement uses a single prefix for all constants.  The
prefix defaults to C<_>, but may be specified by the user.  See
B<Image::DS9::Constants> for more info.

=head1 Obsolete Methods, Changed Interfaces


These methods were available in previous versions of B<DS9>, but
are no longer supported.

=over

=item display

This hid C<tile yes|no>, C<blink>, and C<single>.  Call them
directly.

=item tile_mode

This was really C<tile>, but without the C<tile yes|no> option.
Call C<tile> instead.

=back

The constants previous available from B<Image::DS9> are now available
via B<Image::DS9::OldConstants>.

=head1 REQUIREMENTS

B<Image::DS9> requires B<IPC::XPA> to be installed.  At present, both
B<DS9> and B<xpans> (part of the B<XPA> distribution) must be running
prior to any attempts to access B<DS9>.  B<DS9> will automatically
start B<xpans> if it is in the user's path.

B<DS9> is available at C<http://hea-www.harvard.edu/RD/ds9/>.

B<XPA> is available at C<http://hea-www.harvard.edu/RD/xpa/>.
