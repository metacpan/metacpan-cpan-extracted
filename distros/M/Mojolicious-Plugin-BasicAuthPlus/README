          $self->render(text => 'ok')
              if $self->basic_auth(
                  "My Realm" => {
                      path => '/path/to/some/passwd/file.txt'

DESCRIPTION
    Mojolicious::Plugin::BasicAuthPlus is a helper for basic HTTP
    authentication that supports multiple authentication schemes, including
    a callback, explicit username and password (plaintext or encrypted)
    without a callback, a passwd file, LDAP, and Active Directory.

METHODS
    Mojolicious::Plugin::BasicAuthPlus inherits all methods from
    Mojolicious::Plugin and implements the following new ones.

  "register"
        $plugin->register;

    Register condition in Mojolicious application.

  "basic_auth"
    Configure specific auth method (see CONFIGURATION). Returns a
    two-element list, where the first element is a hash reference and the
    second is an integer (1 for success, 0 for failure).

    In the future, the hash reference may contain additional values, but for
    now it contains just one key/value pair for the username used to
    authenticate. You can ignore this; thus, for example, both of the
    following are valid:

      my ($hash_ref, $auth_ok)
          = $self->basic_auth(
              "My Realm" => {
                  username => 'zapp',
                  password => 'brannigan'
              }
          );
      if ($auth_ok) {
          $self->app->log->info("Auth success for $hash_ref->{username}");
          render(text => 'ok');
      }

      $self->render(text => 'ok')
          if ($self->basic_auth(
              "My Realm" => {
                  username => 'zapp',
                  password => 'brannigan'
              }
          );

  "check_auth"

    Check authentication does the same thing as C<basic_auth> without asking
    for a password if authentication failed.

      my ($hash_ref, $status) = $plugin->check_auth($c, $auth, $params);


CONFIGURATION
    The basic_auth method takes an HTTP Basic Auth realm name that is either
    a code ref for a subroutine that will do the authentication check, or a
    hash, where the realm is the hash name. When the realm represents a
    named hash, the key/value pairs specify the source of user credentials
    and determine the method used for authentication (e.g., passwd file,
    LDAP, Active Directory).

    Realm names may contain whitespace.

    If a username and password are defined, then other options pertaining to
    a passwd file or LDAP/ActiveDirectory authentication will be ignored,
    because it it assumed you intend to compare the defined username and
    password against those supplied by the user.

    The following options may be set in the hash:

  username
    Specify the username to match.

  password
    Specify the password to match. The string may be plaintext or use any of
    the formats noted in Authen::Simple::Password.

  path
    The location of a password file holding user credentials. Per
    Authen::Simple::Passwd, "Any standard passwd file that has records
    seperated with newline and fields seperated by ":" is supported. First
    field is expected to be username and second field, plain or encrypted
    password. Required."

  host
    The hostname or IP address of an LDAP or Active Directory server.

  basedn
    The base DN to use with LDAP or Active Directory.

  binddn
    The bind DN to use when doing an authenticated bind against LDAP or
    Active Directory.

  bindpw
    The password to use when doing an authenticated bind to LDAP or Active
    Directory.

  filter
    The LDAP/ActiveDirectory filter to use when searching a directory.
