Algorithm-GoldenSection version 0.0.2

This module is an implementation of the Golden Section Search Algorithm for finding minima of a unimodal function. 
In order to isolate a minimum of a univariate functions the minimum must first be isolated. 
Consequently the program first bounds a minimum - i.e. the program initially creates a triplet of points: 
x_low < x_int < x_high, such that f(x_int) is lower than both f(x_low) and f(x_high). Thus we ensure that there 
is a local minimum within the interval: x_low-x_high. The program then uses the Golde Section Search algorithm 
to successively narrow down on the bounded region to find the minimum. 
See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_section_search and
http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/manual/html_node/One-dimensional-Minimization.html.

The module provides a Perl5OO interface. Simply construct a Algorithm::GoldenSection object with appropriate parameters
- see L</SYNOPSIS>. Then call the minimise C<method>. This returns a LIST of the value of x at the minimum, the value of
f(x) at the minimum and the number of iterations used to isolate the minimum.
