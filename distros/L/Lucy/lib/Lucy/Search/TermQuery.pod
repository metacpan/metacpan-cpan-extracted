    );
    my $hits = $searcher->hits( query => $term_query );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

TermQuery is a subclass of L<Query|Lucy::Search::Query> for matching

=head1 CONSTRUCTORS

=head2 new

    my $term_query = Lucy::Search::TermQuery->new(

=head2 make_compiler

    my $compiler = $term_query->make_compiler(
        searcher    => $searcher,     # required
        boost       => $boost,        # required
        subordinate => $subordinate,  # default: false
