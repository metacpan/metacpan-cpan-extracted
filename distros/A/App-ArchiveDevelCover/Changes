Changes for App-ArchiveDevelCover

1.002   2012-11-21T22:01:11+0100
    - Better links in archive (Henrik Hald Nørgaard, CPAN-RT#81092)
    - Quote tempfile name in regexps (Pedro Melo)


1.001   2012-06-01T21:45:22+0200
    - added diff.html that shows which coverage metrics
      have changed per file
      NOTE: archives generated with older version probably won't
            display correct, as I've added a new column to the
            HTML table. You will need to add the column by hand to
            index.html


1.000   2012-02-20T21:48:21+0100
    - first release based on a small script I wrote a few days ago
