DESCRIPTION

    OpenAI::API is a Perl module that provides an interface to the OpenAI
    API, which allows you to generate text, translate languages, summarize
    text, and perform other tasks using the language models developed by
    OpenAI.

    To use the OpenAI::API module, you will need an API key, which you can
    obtain by signing up for an account on the OpenAI website
    <https://platform.openai.com>.

INSTALLATION

    If you have cpanm, you only need one line:

        % cpanm OpenAI::API

    Alternatively, if your CPAN shell is set up, you should just be able to
    do:

        % cpan OpenAI::API

    As a last resort, you can manually install it:

        perl Makefile.PL
        make
        make test
        make install

    If your perl is system-managed, you can create a local::lib in your
    home directory to install modules to. For details, see the local::lib
    documentation <https://metacpan.org/pod/local::lib>.

DOCUMENTATION

    After installing, you can find documentation for this module with the
    perldoc command.
