=head1 NAME

KinoSearch::Index::Lexicon - Iterator for a field's terms.

=head1 DEPRECATED

The KinoSearch code base has been assimilated by the Apache L<Lucy> project.
The "KinoSearch" namespace has been deprecated, but development continues
under our new name at our new home: L<http://lucy.apache.org/>

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $lex_reader = $seg_reader->obtain('KinoSearch::Index::LexiconReader');
    my $lexicon = $lex_reader->lexicon( field => 'content' );
    while ( $lexicon->next ) {
       print $lexicon->get_term . "\n";
    }



=head1 DESCRIPTION

A Lexicon is an iterator which provides access to all the unique terms for
a given field in sorted order.

If an index consists of two documents with a 'content' field holding "three
blind mice" and "three musketeers" respectively, then iterating through the
'content' field's lexicon would produce this list:

    blind
    mice
    musketeers
    three



=head1 ABSTRACT METHODS

=head2 seek(target)

Seek the Lexicon to the first iterator state which is greater than or
equal to C<< target >>.  If C<< target >> is undef,
reset the iterator.

=head2 next()

Proceed to the next term.

Returns: true until the iterator is exhausted, then false.

=head2 get_term()

Return the current term, or undef if the iterator is not in a valid
state.

=head2 reset()

Reset the iterator.  next() must be called to proceed to the first
element.
