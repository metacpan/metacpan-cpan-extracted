"tkjuke" is a GUI for manipulating a jukebox in a windowed environment,
which uses the program "juke" as the underlying controller. It has
been tested under AIX,  Linux and IRIX - the default configuration defaults
are suitable for many Linux installations. (There is unsupported code
that uses atape rather than mtx for the controller program. It's a small
mtx <=> atape interface layer I use on AIX. You can manually copy the
two programs atape-mtx and atape-loaderinfo somewhere, and then, during
the "perl Makefile.PL" phase use those programs rather than the real
loaderinfo, mt and mtx programs.)

The "juke" command is a Perl wrapper to the jukebox control program
"mtx".  Once installed and configured, manipulating the jukebox is
totally consistent among various computers.  Additionally, "juke" can
simulate barcodes for jukeboxes lacking an actual barcode reader.  It
does this by consulting an SDBM file that maps barcodes and jukebox
slots.

Perl and Perl/Tk are available from the CPAN, and are presumed already
installed.  "mtx" is available at sourceforge.net, and is presumed
already installed.

This code has been tested with various auto-loading stackers, and I've
written emulation code that simulates larger jukeboxes with multiple
drives, mail slots and invertable media, but since I don't actually
have such a beast, I can only hope everything works in the real world.

"juke" provides a simple command set.  Briefly, here is what "juke" can
do:


juke V2.2.1 usage:

 juke [help]                            - print this information

 juke config                            - print juke.config

 juke status                            - print jukebox status
 
 juke first    [DTE#]                   - unload current media, load first
 juke last     [DTE#]                   - unload current media, load last
 juke next     [DTE#]                   - unload current media, load next
 juke previous [DTE#]                   - unload current media, load previous

 juke [invert] load    SE#  [DTE#]      - load media from jukebox, may be inverted
 juke [invert] unload [SE#] [DTE#]      - return media to jukebox, may be inverted

 juke [eepos eepos#] transfer SE# SE#   - transfer media or bump mail slot

 juke loaded   [DTE#]                   - print barcode(s) of loaded media

 juke barcodes [pathname | SE# barcode] - print or set jukebox barcode list

 juke refresh-tkjuke                    - send SIGHUP to update tkjuke's display
