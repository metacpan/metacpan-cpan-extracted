       The object produced by Data::Pageset can be used to create page naviga-
       tion, it inherits from Data::Page and has access to all methods from
       this object.

       In addition it also provides methods for dealing with set of pages, so
       that if there are too many pages you can easily break them into chunks
       for the user to browse through.

       You can even choose to view page numbers in your set in a 'sliding'
       fassion.

       The object can easily be passed to a templating system such as Template
       Toolkit or be used within a script.

       _n_e_w_(_)

         use Data::Pageset;
         my $page_info = Data::Pageset->new({
           'total_entries'       => $total_entries,
           'entries_per_page'    => $entries_per_page,
           # Optional, will use defaults otherwise.
           'current_page'        => $current_page,
           'pages_per_set'       => $pages_per_set,
           'mode'                => 'slide', # default fixed
         });

       This is the constructor of the object, it requires an anonymous hash
       containing the 'total_entries', how many data units you have, and the
       number of 'entries_per_page' to display. Optionally the 'current_page'
       (defaults to page 1) and pages_per_set (how many pages to display,
       defaults to 10) can be added.

       The mode (which defaults to 'fixed') determins how the paging will
       work, for example with 10 pages_per_set and the current_page set to 18
       you will get the following results:

       _F_i_x_e_d_:

       Pages in set:
           11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20

       Previous page set:
           1

       Next page set:
           21

       _S_l_i_d_e_:

       Pages in set:
           14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23

       Previous page set:
           9

       Next page set:
           24

       You can not change modes once the object is created.

       _c_u_r_r_e_n_t___p_a_g_e_(_)

         $page_info->current_page($page_num);

       This method sets the current_page to the argument supplied, it can also
       be set in the constructor, but you may want to reuse the object if
       printing out multiple pages. It will then return the page number once
       set.

       If this method is called without any arguments it returns the current
       page number.

       _p_a_g_e_s___p_e_r___s_e_t_(_)

         $page_info->pages_per_set($number_of_pages_per_set);

       Calling this method initalises the calculations required to use the
       paging methods below. The value can also be passed into the constructor
       method _n_e_w_(_).

       If called without any arguments it will return the current number of
       pages per set.

       _p_r_e_v_i_o_u_s___s_e_t_(_)

         print "Back to previous set which starts at ", $page_info->previous_set(), "\n";

       This method returns the page number at the start of the previous page
       set.  undef is return if pages_per_set has not been set.

       _n_e_x_t___s_e_t_(_)

         print "Next set starts at ", $page_info->next_set(), "\n";

       This method returns the page number at the start of the next page set.
       undef is return if pages_per_set has not been set.

       _p_a_g_e_s___i_n___s_e_t_(_)

         foreach my $page_num (@{$page_info->pages_in_set()}) {
           print "Page: $page_num \n";
         }

       This method returns an array ref of the the page numbers within the
       current set. undef is return if pages_per_set has not been set.
