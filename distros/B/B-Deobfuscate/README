B::Deobfuscate version 0.19
==========================

B::Deobfuscate is a backend module for the Perl compiler that
generates perl source code, based on the internal compiled structure
that perl itself creates after parsing a program. It adds symbol
renaming functions to the B::Deparse module. An obfuscated program is
already parsed and interpreted correctly by the B::Deparse
program. Unfortunately, if the obfuscation involved variable renaming
then the resulting program also has obfuscated symbols.

This module takes the last step and fixes names like $z5223ed336 to be
a word from a dictionary. While the name still isn't meaningful it is
at least easier to distinguish and read. Here are two examples - one
from B::Deparse and one from B::Deobfuscate.
