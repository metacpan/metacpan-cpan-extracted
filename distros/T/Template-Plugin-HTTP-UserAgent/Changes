0.08 2015-03-08
    - Added a ua_string method, for getting the raw user agent string.

0.07 2014-05-14
    - Switched to Dist::Zilla
    - Switched Perl version dependency from 5.10.0 to 5.6.0.
      I don't seem to have recorded a reason for 5.10.0, and can't
      see an actual dependency on 5.10.0.
    - Various minor documentation improvements.

    - Added "use 5.10.0" to specify min perl version
    - Added new-style github repo details in Makefile.PL

      (was set to dist, instead of module, name)

0.04 2012-02-28

    - Fixed a typo and other tidy-ups of documentation.
    - added 'parent' as a pre-req. Not having it meant that Perl 5.8.9 was
      failing on CPAN testers.
