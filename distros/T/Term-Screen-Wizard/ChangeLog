0.56 -- Addition. If HASPREVIOUS is defined for a screen (HASPREVIOUS => 1),
        if this screen is the first screen to be displayed by the wizard and
        the user touches F3, the wizard is closed, values are saved and
        previous is returned.

0.55 -- BUG fix. After a cancel the values of {NEWVALUE} for all used
        prompts should have been undef'ed. This has been done now.
     -- Added sub system() that executes commands (with system), and also
        resets the terminal to normal input/output.

0.54 -- Hmm, I've been really hacking here. Added a possibility to
        have fields not been used (NIL option) for input, the cursor
        won't touch these fields. Added a field an option READY also, 
        to let the wizard take the next screen if this field is passed.
        
        You can use this with option (READY) together with option 
        NOCOMMIT to have a sort of menu.
        
        I think the code should now be unscrambled sometime. No time
        for that though.

0.53 -- Detected a bug in Term::Screen v1.01 (for solaris). Waiting
        for a patch.

        As solaris doesn't support stty -size, and the Term::Screen
        v1.01 code has a little bug here, Term::Sceen::Wizard 0.52
        does not work. Term::Screen::Wizard 0.53 dies on COLS and ROWS
        having a wrong value.

0.52 -- use strict in again, no strict 'refs' added. Thanks to Andreas
        Marcel Riechert.

0.51 -- As I don't know how to remove 'strict refs', I commented out
        use strict.
        
0.49 -- Fixed a bug. Makefile.PL should now require Term::Screen::ReadLine
        to be at least version 0.33.

0.48 -- Fixed a bug. The Esc, F1, F3 (previous screen) key should work; 
        also when the validator function returns 'false'.

0.47 -- Added an extra parameter to the VALIDATOR function, namely
        $self. So the wizard is given to the validator function as
        the first argument and the inputted line as the second.

0.46 -- Removed a bug. When the user inputs a password, after the
        user leaves the field, the password isn't starred out.
     -- A validator function has been added to validate a field().
     -- A readonly option has been added to a screen.

0.45 -- Removed a bug. When the wizard was called with specific screens,
        all variables were cleared. This has been corrected.
     -- Removed function get_screen() (this has become an internal 
        function).
     -- Added a function set() to set keywords of a screen, or to set
        values of prompts.

0.41 -- Made some changes to the wizard() and get_keys() functions.
        Extended them with the possibility to ask a number of screens.
        This makes it possible to use a selection of all possible
        screens from the wizard.

0.33 -- Enhanced documentation of wizard() function.
     -- Little bug fix. wizard() function now also returns "next", if
        the last prompt of the wizard() has option NOFINISH set.

0.32 -- Converted all files to UNIX format.

0.31 -- Forgot to include the dependencies in Makefile.PL, added them.

0.30 -- Structured the tests in test.pl
     -- Debugged Wizard.pm according to test results.
     -- Extended Makefile.PL to have dependencies.
     -- Added ChangeLog
     -- Added MANIFEST

0.20 -- Initial upload
