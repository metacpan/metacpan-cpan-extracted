NAME
    Dancer2::Plugin::Interchange6 - Interchange6 Shop Plugin for Dancer2

VERSION
    Version 0.203

REQUIREMENTS
    All Interchange6 Dancer2 applications need to use the
    Dancer2::Session::DBIC engine.

    The easiest way to configure this is in your "config.yml" (or whatever
    other configuration file you prefer):

      plugins
        DBIC:
          default:
            schema_class: Interchange6::Schema
            # ... other DBIC plugin config here
      engines:
        session:
          DBIC:
            db_connection_name: default # connection name from DBIC plugin
      session: DBIC

CONFIGURATION
    Available configuration options:

      plugins:
        Interchange6:
          cart_class: MyApp::Cart
          carts_var_name: some_other_var

    *   cart_class

        If you wish to subclass the cart you can have "shop_cart" return
        your subclassed cart instead. You set the cart class via
        "cart_class". Defaults to Dancer2::Plugin::Interchange6::Cart.

    *   carts_var_name

        The plugin caches carts in a "var" in Dancer2 and the name of the
        var used can be set via "carts_var_name". Defaults to "ic6_carts".

ROUTES
    You can use the Dancer2::Plugin::Interchange6::Routes plugin bundled
    with this plugin to setup standard routes for:

    product listing
    product display
    cart display
    checkout form

    To enable these routes, you put the "shop_setup_routes" keyword at the
    end of your main module:

        package MyShop;

        use Dancer2;
        use Dancer2::Plugin::Interchange6;
        use Dancer2::Plugin::Interchange6::Routes;

        get '/shop' => sub {
            ...
        };

        ...

        shop_setup_routes;

        true;

    Please refer to Dancer2::Plugin::Interchange6::Routes for configuration
    options and further information.
