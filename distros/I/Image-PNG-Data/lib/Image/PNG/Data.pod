Image::PNG::Data - manipulate the image data part of PNGs

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Image::PNG::Data;

=head1 VERSION

This documents version 0.01 of Image-PNG-Data
corresponding to L<git commit 64ed7dcffc6a69ab13a59d60c01a8c10fae08e53|https://github.com/benkasminbullock/image-png-data/commit/64ed7dcffc6a69ab13a59d60c01a8c10fae08e53> released on Thu Apr 8 17:01:29 2021 +0900.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides various utilities for manipulating and testing
the image data part of a PNG image. This is a companion module to
L<Image::PNG::Libpng> by the same authors.

B<The documentation below refers to functions which are not yet
implemented.>

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=head2 alpha_unused

    if (alpha_unused (read_png_file ('some.png')) {

Is the alpha channel in the image unused? This function returns a true
value if the PNG has an alpha channel and it is not being used. If the
image doesn't have an alpha channel it returns the undefined value. If
it has an alpha channel and it is being used it returns 0.

=head2 any2gray8

    my $wpng = any2gray8 ("any.png");

Convert any type of PNG file whatsoever into a bit-depth 8 grayscale
image without an alpha channel (C<PNG_COLOR_TYPE_GRAY>). The return
value is a write structure as made by
L<Image::PNG::Libpng/create_write_struct>.

Currently the C<tRNS> chunk (see L<Image::PNG::Libpng/tRNS>) is
ignored by this.

By default the alpha channel is set to either the value of the C<bKGD>
chunk (see L<Image::PNG::Libpng/bKGD>) if there is one, or white if
not. You can set another background using the option C<bkgd>:

    my $wpng = any2gray8 ('any.png', bkgd => {red => 255, green => 0, blue => 99});

This will of course be ignored if F<any.png> does not contain an alpha
channel. RGB to gray conversion is done using
L<Image::PNG::Libpng/set_rgb_to_gray> with the default values.

This function is not supported for versions of libpng earlier than
1.6.14.

=head2 bwpng

    my $png = bwpng (\@rows, sq => 20);

Convert boolean-style data into a black and white PNG. A two-color PNG
is also possible:

    bwpng (\@rows, black => '#CFF', white => '#C00');



=head2 rgb2gray

    my $gray_png = rgb2gray ('colorful.png');

Convert an RGB PNG image to a grayscale one.

Options:


grayonly


=head2 rmalpha

    my $png = rmalpha ('file.png');

Remove the alpha channel of the PNG. If the input PNG has a color type
other than C<GRAY_ALPHA> or C<RGB_ALPHA>, a warning is printed and the
return value is undefined. The return value is an Image::PNG::Libpng
structure for writing with the alpha channel data removed.

=head2 split_alpha

Unimplemented, due to be copied from L<Image::PNG::Libpng>.

=head1 SEE ALSO

=head2 Online PNG tools

=over

=item L<https://onlinepngtools.com/convert-png-to-grayscale>

Converts your PNG to grayscale via JavaScript. This actually resizes
the image to the size of its box, but you can save the image with the
Save as... link and you get the original size back.
