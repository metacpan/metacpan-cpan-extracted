Test-More-Behaviours version 0.0.2

This module was initially written by Antony Marcano when he was working with my team to help us practicing Test Driven Development.

It doesn't do much but it helps keeping Test::More based tests organized and documented in a way that make sense.
In addition, the set_up() and tear_down() mechanisms provided by JUnit was missed by Antony (who has a background in Java Development), so this feature has been added.

This module has also been used and exercised during several Coding Dojos.
