=head1 DESCRIPTION

This chapter of the tutorial explores more advanced functionality for
Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) than we saw in
L<Chapter 4|Catalyst::Manual::Tutorial::04_BasicCRUD>.  In particular,
it looks at a number of techniques that can be useful for the Update
portion of CRUD, such as automated form generation, validation of
user-entered data, and automated transfer of data between forms and
model objects.

In keeping with the Catalyst (and Perl) spirit of flexibility, there are
many different ways to approach advanced CRUD operations in a Catalyst
environment.  Therefore, this section of the tutorial allows you to pick
from one of several modules that cover different form management
tools.  Select one or more options from the list below.
