1.78 2020-05-20T16:50:59+02:00 (d4bd262 => Abe Timmerman)
 - (Abe Timmerman, 65 seconds ago) Autocommit for distribution Test::Smoke
   1.78 (minor)

1.77_04 2020-05-20T12:28:49+02:00 (9c4724d => Abe Timmerman)
 - (Abe Timmerman, 4 hours ago) Autocommit for distribution Test::Smoke
   1.77_04 (test)

 - (Abe Timmerman, 6 minutes ago) More cleanup of HTTP::Lite: 28f09320
   wasn't enough
 -     We really dropped support for HTTP::Lite

1.77_03 2020-05-19T23:11:59+02:00 (40678ef => Abe Timmerman)
 - (Abe Timmerman, 18 hours ago) Autocommit for distribution Test::Smoke
   1.77_03 (test)

 - (Abe Timmerman, 4 hours ago)  More poster-post problems (HTTP::Tiny)
 -	IPv6 is not supported in HTTP::Tiny < 0.042. Alas 5.24.[1-4]
   shipped
 -	with a DEV-version of the module. We must now use
   `version->parse()` to
 -	compare `$HTTP::Tiny::VERSION`

1.77_02 2020-05-19T15:20:21+02:00 (e978fd4 => Abe Timmerman)
 - (Abe Timmerman, 26 hours ago) Autocommit for distribution Test::Smoke
   1.77_02 (test)

 - (Abe Timmerman, 25 hours ago) State MIN_PERL_VERSION in Makefile.PL
 -     6 years overdue... sorry Neil

 - (Abe Timmerman, 25 hours ago) RT#132507: Remove the version number

 - (Abe Timmerman, 18 hours ago) More poster-post problems (curl)
 -     Older curls do need some help to understand the 'http://[::1]:54321'
 -     syntax, so quote the argument and use the '--globoff' switch

 - (Abe Timmerman, 18 hours ago) Merge branch
   'cleanup/remove_support_HTTP_Lite'

1.77_01 2020-05-19T11:52:30+02:00 (d959cb4 => Abe Timmerman)
 - (Abe Timmerman, 29 hours ago) Test::Smoke::LogMixin: no sprintf without
   arguments
 -     The log_* routines use the sprintf() way of creating log-lines. When
 -     there are no arguments, there is no need to use sprintf() and risk
 -     warnings about missing arguments or invalid conversion for bare %
   signs.
 -     (I ran into this with the output of `git clone`)

 - (Abe Timmerman, 28 hours ago) Test::Smoke::Syncer::Git: fix problem with
   the branchfile
 -     The first line was read but not chomp()ed, so if one had
   (mistakenly)
 -     put multiple lines in the file, the command line for the `git
   checkout`
 -     would have been wrong and that branch would not have been checked
   out.
 -     I hope that this also resolves part of RT#128950

 - (Abe Timmerman, 26 hours ago) Prefer JSON::PP over JSON::XS

 - (Abe Timmerman, 26 hours ago) Provide better flow and diagnostics for
   the Posters
 -     Untangle the actual POST and json-decode in the `post`-method.
 -     Also make the clients die from the `_post_data`-method if the
   request
 -     didn't return a 2xx.

 - (Abe Timmerman, 26 hours ago) Provide better diagnostics on failure with
   TEST_VERBOSE
 -     This provides invalid TAP, but compile-errors are worse!

1.77 2020-05-18T18:55:53+02:00 (046d80a => Abe Timmerman)
 - (Abe Timmerman, 2 days ago) Remove support for HTTP::Lite
 -     We ran into a bug for HTTP::Lite that was reported 6 years ago, that
 -     will not be fixed anymore. No need to keep support for this module
 -     around now that HTTP::Tiny is in core (>= 5.14).

1.76_01 2020-05-13T15:51:25+02:00 (c5bf6ca => Abe Timmerman)
 - (Abe Timmerman, 7 days ago) Autocommit for distribution Test::Smoke
   1.76_01 (test)

1.76 2020-05-12T20:54:37+02:00 (0801dd6 => Abe Timmerman)
 - (Abe Timmerman, 8 days ago) Autocommit for distribution Test::Smoke 1.76
   (minor)

 - (H.Merijn Brand, 1 year, 1 month ago) Add support for -Uxx and -Dxx=y on
   tssmokeperl.pl
 -     When a smokescript smokes for two different compilers, it is likely
   to use
 -     something like
 -     :
 -     /pro/bin/perl tssmokeperl.pl --nofetch --nopatch \
 -	   -c "$CFGNAME" $continue $* -Dcc=gcc > p59.log 2>&1
 -     :
 -     :
 -     /pro/bin/perl tssmokeperl.pl --nofetch --nopatch \
 -	   -c "$CFGNAME" $continue $* -Dcc=g++ > p59.log 2>&1
 -     :
 -     This change allows tssmokeperl.pl to accept -Dcc=gcc and/or -Ucc
 -     and make it DWIM. Before this change, these command-line options
 -     were silently ignored.
 -     Only existing options can be (un)set

 - (H.Merijn Brand - Tux, 1 year, 1 month ago) Moving -Dxx=... and -Uxx to
   the correct spot

 - (H.Merijn Brand - Tux, 1 year, 1 month ago) Also allow -A options

 - (Abe Timmerman, 7 days ago) Add a Serialiser
 -     This is a simple serialiser, I still have to hunt the rest of the
   code
 -     for uses of Data::Dumper type serialisations and see if I can change
 -     them.

 - (Abe Timmerman, 7 days ago) Add a '--pass_option' switch to the
   runsmoke-applet
 -     This (repeatable) option will let one pass extra options to
   Configure
 -     from the 'tsrunsmoke.pl' (and thus 'tssmokeperl.pl') commandline:
 -     ~/coresmoke/ts/bin/tssmokeperl.pl -c "$CFGNAME" $* \
 -	    --pass-option '-Dusesuperthreads' \
 -	    -p '-Uusesuperfiles' > p59.log 2>&1
 -     This is what Tux put in a commit message for a different solution of
 -     his own request:
 -     When a smokescript smokes for two different compilers, it is likely
   to
 -     use something like
 -     /pro/bin/perl tssmokeperl.pl --nofetch --nopatch \
 -	   -c "$CFGNAME" $continue $* -Dcc=gcc > p59.log 2>&1
 -     /pro/bin/perl tssmokeperl.pl --nofetch --nopatch \
 -	   -c "$CFGNAME" $continue $* -Dcc=g++ > p59.log 2>&1
 -     This change allows tssmokeperl.pl to accept -Dcc=gcc and/or -Ucc
 -     and make it DWIM. Before this change, these command-line options
 -     were silently ignored.

1.75 2020-03-01T12:41:23+01:00 (995b2f9 => Abe Timmerman)
 - (Abe Timmerman, 3 months ago) Autocommit for distribution Test::Smoke
   1.75 (same)

 - (H.Merijn Brand - Tux, 7 months ago) Ignore all date/time information in
   dot_patch
 -     As we are only interested in the branch (first field), the sha and
   the
 -     describe (last two fields), just take those and ignore everything in
 -     between, so we cannot be fooled by (missing) time-zones or date
   formats
 -     that do not match our expectation

1.74 2020-02-09T16:36:26+01:00 (f119510 => Abe Timmerman)

 - (Abe Timmerman, 3 months ago) FIX: add dependency introduced by
   be0b7a9438bdc9b25176dc8676641aff3bfc6413
 -     We forgot to add Capture::Tiny to the dependencies in Makefile.PL

1.73 2019-08-13T09:33:02+02:00 (b6ca9bd => Abe Timmerman)
 - (Abe Timmerman, 9 months ago) Autocommit for distribution Test::Smoke
   1.73 (minor)

 - (James E Keenan, 3 months ago) Update location of Perl 5 repository
 -     Note that I did not attempt to update all instances of the old
 -     repository in bin/configsmoke.pl.
 -     Needs careful code review.

   1.72_07 (test)

1.72_05 2018-04-22T13:15:31+02:00 (91ae91a => abeltje)
 - (abeltje, 2 years, 1 month ago) Autocommit for distribution Test::Smoke
   1.72_05 (test)

 - (James E Keenan, 1 year, 9 months ago) Report all failing unit tests and
   sequences thereof.
 -     The 'log' and 'out' files were correctly identifying failed unit
   tests and
 -     sequences thereof, e.g.:
 -	  
   ../lib/locale.t.............................................FAILED
 -	       436-437, 441, 444, 458
 -     However, only the first of these was being captured by
 -     Test::Smoke::Reporter::_parse() -- called from within
 -     Test::Smoke::Reporter::read_parse() -- and, hence, only the first
   was
 -     available for recording in the 'jsn' file:
 -	   "failures" : [
 -	      {
 -		 "status" : "FAILED",
 -		 "extra" : [
 -		    "436-437"
 -		 ],
 -		 "test" : "../lib/locale.t"
 -	      }
 -	   ],
 -     And since it is the 'jsn' file that is sent to the CoreSmoke
   database -- from
 -     which the web display draws its data -- the web page was only
   showing this:
 -	   Test failures:
 -	   ~~ ../lib/locale.t ................................ FAILED
   436-437
 -     Cf. http://perl5.test-smoke.org/report/68034
 -     This commit improves the regex capturing the numbers of failing unit
   tests and
 -     sequences of such tests.  In t/reporter.t one block of tests similar
   to
 -     existing blocks is added.
 -     The commit also adds to .gitignore one file created during testing.
 -     For: RTC 125932

 - (James E Keenan, 1 year, 9 months ago) Correct typo in 4 log messages.
 -     For: rt.cpan.org 126045

 - (James E Keenan, 1 year, 9 months ago) Correct spelling of 'omitted' in
   5 locations.

 - (James E Keenan, 1 year, 9 months ago) Report all failing unit tests and
   sequences thereof.
 -     For: https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=125932
 -     In directory logs/smokecurrent/, the '.log' and '.out' files were
   correctly

   working dir before branch
 -     We update the `patchlevel.h` file before the smoke. In some cases
   this
 -     changed file doesn't allow us to checkout the branch we want to
   smoke,
 -     so now before we start updating the working dir we `reset --hard
   HEAD`
 -     See also RT#127577

   and silence stderr with nul on win32

 - (Christian Walde, 1 year, 9 months ago) switch _run from qx to

 - (Christian Walde, 1 year, 9 months ago) on windows, dump make stdout
   under gcc as well

 - (Christian Walde, 1 year, 9 months ago) add binmode so change_manifest
   doesn't mangle the makefile too badly

 - (Christian Walde, 1 year, 9 months ago) [HACK] convert set_skip_tests to
   replace skipped tests with print ok 1
 -     this works around a shitton of manifest- and manifest-test-related
   issues,
 -     but also breaks the unsetting. might needs to work by copying the
   skipped
 -     tests somewhere else.

 - (Christian Walde, 1 year, 9 months ago) add w32args to general options
   list for runsmoke
 -     not sure if this is useful, was an attempt to get cchome into the
   makefile,
 -     but didn't work

 - (H.Merijn Brand - Tux, 1 year, 1 month ago) Revert "[HACK] convert

 -     nice together.
 -     Add a dependency for 'Win32::API' on MSWin32.

 - (abeltje, 2 years, 1 month ago) Don't use a 'fallback' JSON.pm
 -     We now just call it 'Test::Smoke::Util::LoadAJSON' and have it

1.70_10 2017-05-13T15:57:58+02:00 (153b0a1 => abeltje)
 - (abeltje, 3 years ago) Merge branch 'rt/39138'

 - (abeltje, 3 years ago) Fix get_avail_w32compilers() by Steve Hay:
 -     Test-Smoke-1.42 fails to detect the ccversion for my MSVC++
 -     installations, which all reside under "C:\Program Files\...". It
   tries
 -     to run a command like
 -     "$map{ $CC }->{ccbin}" --version 2>&1
 -     but the 'ccbin' there comes from whereis() and is already
   double-quoted
 -     if it contains spaces, which causes an error like
 -     '""C:\Program' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
 -     operable program or batch file.
 -     The attached patch fixes this.
 -     https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=54542

 - (abeltje, 3 years ago) Handle 'development-releases' of Test::Harness in
   core
 -     Sometimes a "_nm" release of Test::Harness in blead, we need to deal
 -     with it. eval("$version") seems the easiest way.

 - (James E Keenan, 3 years ago) Correct multiple typos.
 -     Also: some grammatical corrections and improvements in text flow.

 - (abeltje, 3 years ago) Fix test syncer_rsync.t for Windows
 -     (Cygwin)rsync doesn't understand Windows-paths (C:\Some\Path) but it
   handles UNC-paths (//localhost/C$/Some/Path), so we fix the test.
 -     Left the actual code unchanged, as we normally rsync from a remote
   path.

 -     path. That function prepends '../t/' to tests, unless their name

 -     It by default reports the most recent consistent level. If a single
 -     fileset is missing  (for example /usr/include files)  at the latest
 -     level, the old level is reported rather than the level of "most" of

   and

   (integer

   every 
 -     test verbosely!

 -		    There is a new config variable "ccp5p_onfail" that is
   implented in Test::Smoke::Mailer and depends on the Summary (PASS/FAIL)
   in the subject. It will do a basic check on the To: and Cc: header
   fields to try and avoid having p5p in there twice.
