NAME

    Dancer::Plugin::Email - Simple email sending for Dancer applications

VERSION

    version 1.0400

SYNOPSIS

        use Dancer;
        use Dancer::Plugin::Email;
        
        post '/contact' => sub {
            email {
                from    => 'bob@foo.com',
                to      => 'sue@foo.com',
                subject => 'allo',
                body    => 'Dear Sue, ...',
                attach  => '/path/to/attachment',
            };
        };

DESCRIPTION

    This plugin tries to make sending emails from Dancer applications as
    simple as possible. It uses Email::Sender under the hood. In a lot of
    cases, no configuration is required. For example, if your app is hosted
    on a unix-like server with sendmail installed, calling email() will
    just do the right thing.

    IMPORTANT: Version 1.x of this module is not backwards compatible with
    the 0.x versions. This module was originally built on Email::Stuff
    which was built on Email::Send which has been deprecated in favor of
    Email::Sender. Versions 1.x and on have be refactored to use
    Email::Sender. I have tried to keep the interface the same as much as
    possible. The main difference is the configuration. If there are
    features missing that you were using in older versions, then please let
    me know by creating an issue on github
    <https://github.com/ironcamel/Dancer-Plugin-Email>.

FUNCTIONS

    This module by default exports the single function email.

 email

    This function sends an email. It takes a single argument, a hashref of
    parameters. Default values for the parameters may be provided in the
    headers section of the "CONFIGURATION". Paramaters provided to this
    function will override the corresponding configuration values if there
    is any overlap. An exception is thrown if sending the email fails, so
    wrapping calls to email with try/catch is recommended.

        use Dancer;
        use Dancer::Plugin::Email;
        use Try::Tiny;
    
        post '/contact' => sub {
            try {
                email {
                    sender  => 'bounces-here@foo.com', # optional
                    from    => 'bob@foo.com',
                    to      => 'sue@foo.com, jane@foo.com',
                    bcc     => 'sam@foo.com',
                    subject => 'allo',
                    body    => 'Dear Sue, ...<img src="cid:blabla">',
                    multipart => 'related', # optional, see below
                    attach  => [
                        '/path/to/attachment1',
                        '/path/to/attachment2',
                        {
                            Path => "/path/to/attachment3",
                            # Path is required when passing a hashref.
                            # See Mime::Entity for other optional values.
                            Id => "blabla",
                        }
                    ],
                    type    => 'html', # can be 'html' or 'plain'
                    # Optional extra headers
                    headers => {
                        "X-Mailer"          => 'This fine Dancer application',
                        "X-Accept-Language" => 'en',
                    }
                };
            } catch {
                error "Could not send email: $_";
            };
        };

CONFIGURATION

    No configuration is necessarily required. Email::Sender::Simple tries
    to make a good guess about how to send the message. It will usually try
    to use the sendmail program on unix-like systems and SMTP on Windows.
    However, you may explicitly configure a transport in your
    configuration. Only one transport may be configured. For documentation
    for the parameters of the transport, see the corresponding
    Email::Sender::Transport::* module. For example, the parameters
    available for the SMTP transport are documented here "ATTRIBUTES" in
    Email::Sender::Transport::SMTP.

    You may also provide default headers in the configuration:

        plugins:
          Email:
            # Set default headers (OPTIONAL)
            headers:
              sender: 'bounces-here@foo.com'
              from: 'bob@foo.com'
              subject: 'default subject'
              X-Mailer: 'MyDancer 1.0'
              X-Accept-Language: 'en'
            # Explicity set a transport (OPTIONAL)
            transport:
              Sendmail:
                sendmail: '/usr/sbin/sendmail'

    Example configuration for sending mail via Gmail:

        plugins:
          Email:
            transport:
              SMTP:
                ssl: 1
                host: 'smtp.gmail.com'
                port: 465
                sasl_username: 'bob@gmail.com'
                sasl_password: 'secret'

    Use the Sendmail transport using the sendmail program in the system
    path:

        plugins:
          Email:
            transport:
              Sendmail:

    Use the Sendmail transport with an explicit path to the sendmail
    program:

        plugins:
          Email:
            transport:
              Sendmail:
                sendmail: '/usr/sbin/sendmail'

 Multipart messages

    You can embed images in HTML messages this way: first, set the type to
    html. Then pass the attachments as hashrefs, setting Path and Id. In
    the HTML body, refer to the attachment using the Id, prepending cid: in
    the src attribute. This works for popular webmail clients like Gmail
    and OE, but is not enough for Thunderbird, which wants a
    multipart/related mail, not the default multipart/mixed. You can fix
    this adding the multipart parameter set to related, which set the
    desired subtype when you pass attachments.

    Example:

      email {
             from    => $from,
             to      => $to,
             subject => $subject,
             body    => q{<p>Image embedded: <img src="cid:mycid"/></p>},
             type    => 'html',
             attach  => [ { Id => 'mycid', Path => '/path/to/file' }],
             multipart => 'related'
            };

    The attach value accepts either a single attachment or an arrayref of
    attachment. Each attachment may be a scalar, with the path of the file
    to attach, or an hashref, in which case the hashref is passed to the
    Mime::Entity's attach method.
