0.12    2017-09-18

        [ADDITIONS]

        [IMPROVEMENTS]

        - The newly added functions in Math::MPFR-3.36, Rmpfr_q_div() and Rmpfr_z_div(), are now used by Math::AnyNum.

        [PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATIONS]

        - Re-implemented all the methods without Class::Multimethods, which makes Math::AnyNum ~35% faster.
        - Many internal simplifications and optimizations.

0.11    2017-07-11

        [IMPROVEMENTS]

        - Extended the `rising_factorial(n, k)` and `falling_factorial(n, k)` for negative values of `k`.

        - Optimized `eta(n)` and `zeta(n)` for values of `n` that fit inside a native unsigned integer.

        [OTHER]

        - Fixed the number of skipped tests under old versions of GMP in t/integer_functions.t.

        [FIXES]

        - Fixed `eta(NaN)` to return `NaN` instead of `log(2)`.
        - Fixed `atanh(NaN)` to return `NaN` instead of `NaN+NaNi`.
        - Fixed the return value of `lgrt(+i)` and `lgrt(-i)`.

        [FIXES]

        - Fixed the (in)equality checks when one of the operands is NaN.
