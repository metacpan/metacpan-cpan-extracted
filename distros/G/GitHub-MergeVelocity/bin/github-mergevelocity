=head2 url

Expects an URL to a Github repository.  Multiple C<--url> args can be supplied.

    github-mergevelocity --url oalders/html-restrict --url https://github.com/neilbowers/PAUSE-Packages

An url can be a proper URL to a git repo or even as succinct as
'username/repository-name'.

If you're really lazy, you can even paste in an entire url which contains the
repo in it.  Be creative!
