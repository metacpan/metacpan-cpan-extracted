NAME
    Crypt::DSA - DSA Signatures and Key Generation

SYNOPSIS
        use Crypt::DSA;
        my $dsa = Crypt::DSA->new;

        my $key = $dsa->keygen(
                       Size      => 512,
                       Seed      => $seed,
                       Verbosity => 1
                  );

        my $sig = $dsa->sign(
                       Message   => "foo bar",
                       Key       => $key
                  );

        my $verified = $dsa->verify(
                       Message   => "foo bar",
                       Signature => $sig,
                       Key       => $key,
                  );

DESCRIPTION
    *Crypt::DSA* is an implementation of the DSA (Digital Signature
    Algorithm) signature verification system. The implementation itself is
    pure Perl, although the heavy-duty mathematics underneath are provided
    by the *Math::Pari* library.

    This package provides DSA signing, signature verification, and key
    generation.

USAGE
    The *Crypt::DSA* public interface is similar to that of *Crypt::RSA*.
    This was done intentionally.

  Crypt::DSA->new
    Constructs a new *Crypt::DSA* object. At the moment this isn't
    particularly useful in itself, other than being the object you need to
    do much else in the system.

    Returns the new object.

  $key = $dsa->keygen(%arg)
    Generates a new set of DSA keys, including both the public and private
    portions of the key.

    *%arg* can contain:

    *   Size

        The size in bits of the *p* value to generate. The *q* and *g*
        values are always 160 bits each.

        This argument is mandatory.

    *   Seed

        A seed with which *q* generation will begin. If this seed does not
        lead to a suitable prime, it will be discarded, and a new random
        seed chosen in its place, until a suitable prime can be found.

        This is entirely optional, and if not provided a random seed will be
        generated automatically.

    *   Verbosity

        Should be either 0 or 1. A value of 1 will give you a progress meter
        during *p* and *q* generation--this can be useful, since the process
        can be relatively long.

        The default is 0.

  $signature = $dsa->sign(%arg)
    Signs a message (or the digest of a message) using the private portion
    of the DSA key and returns the signature.

    The return value--the signature--is a *Crypt::DSA::Signature* object.

    *%arg* can include:

    *   Digest

        A digest to be signed. The digest should be 20 bytes in length or
        less.

        You must provide either this argument or *Message* (see below).

    *   Key

        The *Crypt::DSA::Key* object with which the signature will be
        generated. Should contain a private key attribute (*priv_key*).

        This argument is required.

    *   Message

        A plaintext message to be signed. If you provide this argument,
        *sign* will first produce a SHA1 digest of the plaintext, then use
        that as the digest to sign. Thus writing

            my $sign = $dsa->sign(Message => $message, ... );

        is a shorter way of writing

            use Digest::SHA1 qw( sha1 );
            my $sig = $dsa->sign(Digest => sha1( $message ), ... );

  $verified = $dsa->verify(%arg)
    Verifies a signature generated with *sign*. Returns a true value on
    success and false on failure.

    *%arg* can contain:

    *   Key

        Key of the signer of the message; a *Crypt::DSA::Key* object. The
        public portion of the key is used to verify the signature.

        This argument is required.

    *   Signature

        The signature itself. Should be in the same format as returned from
        *sign*, a *Crypt::DSA::Signature* object.

        This argument is required.

    *   Digest

        The original signed digest whose length is less than or equal to 20
        bytes.

        Either this argument or *Message* (see below) must be present.

    *   Message

        As above in *sign*, the plaintext message that was signed, a string
        of arbitrary length. A SHA1 digest of this message will be created
        and used in the verification process.

TODO
    Add ability to munge format of keys. For example, read/write keys
    from/to key files (SSH key files, etc.), and also write them in other
    formats.
