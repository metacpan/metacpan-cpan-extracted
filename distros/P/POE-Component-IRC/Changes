6.75  Sun Nov 13 14:24:50 UTC 2011
    - Win32 fixes to the DCC plugin and netsplit test
    - You couldn't specify a localaddr without a localport. Fixed.

6.74  Sun Oct 9 20:16:13 GMT 2011
    - Disable authentication in t/01_base/04_pocosi.t. Fixes test failure.

6.73  Sat Oct 8 04:40:18 GMT 2011
    - Add missing dependencies to t/inc needed by poco-server-irc

6.72  Fri Oct 7 15:41:53 UTC 2011
    - Skip IPv6 tests on systems which don't have inet_pton()
    - Fix regression in t/03_subclasses/01_state.t
    - Update the poco-server-irc in t/inc to version 1.53

6.71  Sun Sep 18 16:07:33 GMT 2011
    - Make the component easier to use with dynamic IP interfaces
    - Fix race condition in 06_state_nick_sync.t
    - Silence warning due to incorrect use of length() instead of defined()
    - State.pm: Add a parameter to irc_topic containing the old topic

    - State.pm: Support nick!user@host in NAMES replies (UHNAMES)
    - State.pm: Added channel_url()
    - Fixed a race condition in 06_state_nick_sync.t

6.69  Fri Jul 29 01:52:38 GMT 2011
    - Whois.pm: Collect info from numerics 307 and 310
    - Whois.pm: Removed the 'account' key and have the 'identified' key
      do its thing instead, so that there is one generic way to check if
      a user is identified, regardless of the network.

6.68  Sun May 22 17:01:21 GMT 2011
    - REALLY fix it to work with the latest IRC::Utils

6.67  Sun May 22 16:43:27 GMT 2011
    - Add missing documentation for irc_plugin_(add|del|error) events
    - IRC.pm: Improved the layout of the documentation
    - Common.pm: Fix to work with latest IRC::Utils

6.66  Thu May 19 22:32:07 GMT 2011
    - BotCommand.pm: Allow commands to be \S+, not just \w+

6.65  Thu May 19 01:54:21 GMT 2011
    - BotCommand.pm: Quote the 'Prefix' before using it in a regex, and add
      'Bare_private' to allow commands in private without a prefix

6.64  Sun May 15 09:59:12 GMT 2011
    - Fix incorrect amount of tests skipped in 04_ipv6.t when IPv6 is not
      supported

6.63  Sun May 15 05:06:57 GMT 2011
    - Remove vestigial 'unregister' event handler, poco-syndicator handles
      that now. The latest poco-syndicator release croaks if we try to
      override its handler, so this was causing failures.

6.62  Tue May 3 10:58:45 GMT 2011
    - Make use of IPv6 functions from Socket (instead of Socket6) if
      they are available, and skip the IPv6 test if we don't have an
      implementation of getaddrinfo(). Thanks to Apocalypse for this.
    - Add a parameter to irc_snotice which contains the target of the
      message (usually '*' or 'AUTH' or something).
    - Qnet/State.pm: Forgot to import parse_user() from IRC::Utils.
    - IRC.pm: Document the Bitmode parameter and make it 8 (+i) by default.
    - IRC.pm: Remove a sizable chunk of the code and inherit from
      POE::Component::Syndicator instead. Got rid of an old backwards
      compatability workaround in the process: sessions will no longer
      receive irc_connected/irc_disconnected/irc_shutdown events if they
      didn't register for them.
    - Console.pm: Avoid custom stringifications when dumping objects
    - State.pm: nick_info() was failing when a nick was known but unsynced
    - Console.pm: Decode all arguments before printing them

6.61  Tue Apr 19 17:02:54 GMT 2011
    - The changes to the filter test were causing failures on <5.12 due to
      C<values(ARRAY)>. Fixed it.
    - Make it so that irc_shutdown is always the last event to be sent
    - Depend on POE 1.310 to fix failing socket error test on Windows
    - Improve event queue ordering to make it more predictable. Add new
      methods, send_event_next() and send_event_now(), to bypass the
      event queue in different ways.
    - Replace the functions in Common.pm with wrappers around equivalents
      from IRC::Utils.
    - IRC.pm: Add server() and port() accessors.

6.60  Fri Apr 15 06:12:28 GMT 2011
    - Fix failure (RT #67465) related to the recent irc_snotice change.
      Added a test for it as well.

6.59  Mon Apr 4 20:22:38 GMT 2011
    - FollowTail, Logger & DCC: Use rel2abs instead of abs_path to
      preserve symlinks while still being unaffected by chdir()

6.58  Mon Apr 4 17:48:59 GMT 2011
    - Fix FollowTail test to work in case /tmp is a symlink

6.57  Sat Apr 2 03:34:04 GMT 2011
    - FollowTail, Logger & DCC plugins: Expand '~' in filename arguments,
      and resolve them to absolute paths, in case the process will chdir().

6.56  Fri Apr 1 20:05:14 GMT 2011
    - irc_snotice has been used for server NOTICEs which do not have a sender
      prefix. NOTICEs which have a server name as the sender prefix are now
      irc_snotice too, leaving irc_notice only for notices with a proper
      nick!user@host sender.

6.55  Fri Apr 1 18:37:49 GMT 2011
    - State.pm: Store the real nicks of channel members after receiving a
      NAMES reply. Fixes the issue of undefined nicks being returned by
      channel_list() before the channel has been synced.
    - State.pm: Check all arguments for definedness in public methods for
      easier debugging

6.54  Thu Mar 10 18:20:47 GMT 2011
    - Fixed all the trailing space 'errors'
    - Resolve an issue with irc_nick_sync in poco-irc-state, added test

6.52  Fri Nov 5 18:27:16 CET 2010
    - Fixed typo in shutdown code and added a test to confirm

6.51  Fri Nov 5 12:28:14 CET 2010
    - Make the t/02_behavior/06_online.t test a TODO, since we can't work
      around problems such as the user being K-lined from FreeNode
    - Save the sender id on shutdown, not the sender's reference, avoids
      a crash when a sender disappears before we complete the shutdown

6.50  Wed Nov 3 02:05:56 GMT 2010
    - Fix race condition causing a duplicated test in
      t/04_plugins/12_autojoin/03_banned.t
    - Console.pm: Dump hashes and arrays recursively
    - Enable all debugging messages if $ENV{POCOIRC_DEBUG} is true
    - Make the 'shutdown' event do more work for us, such as forcibly
      disconnecting after a timeout if the server doesn't disconnect us
      following a QUIT command
    - Add an irc_raw_out event, corollary to irc_raw
    - AutoJoin.pm: Don't require the component to be ::State

6.49  Sat Oct 16 19:05:25 GMT 2010
    - Add draft-mitchell-irc-capabilities-02.html to docs/
    - Fix incorrect number of skipped tests in 06_online.t in some cases
    - Allow IRC server passwords which evaluate to false (e.g. '0')
    - Prevent possible race conditions in a few tests

6.48  Sun Oct 3 19:49:20 GMT 2010
    - State.pm: Don't send an undefined value with irc_chan_mode when the
      mode has no argument
    - Console.pm: Improve the readability of the output, and show undef
    - Deliver irc_plugin_error immediately, bypassing the event queue

6.47  Sun Oct 3 15:28:50 GMT 2010
    - Join arguments to the 'quote' command with spaces. This allows us to
      send commands with multiple arguments through the Console plugin.
    - Add support for CAP command/replies. We use it to enable the server's
      identify-msg feature when we connect.
    - State.pm: In disconnected/error/socketerr events when no info is
      available, make ARG1 an empty hash reference instead of undef.
    - Console.pm: Don't send events to client before they're authed
    - Console.pm: Pretty-print hash references

6.46  Wed Sep 29 04:57:42 UTC 2010
    - Document the 'debug' parameter.
    - Use Object::Pluggable instead of POE::Component::Pluggable. This smooths
      out an inconsistency between plugins and normal sessions with regard to
      events where extra arguments have been added.

6.45  Sun Sep 26 03:41:48 GMT 2010
    - Don't create a POE::Component::Client::DNS object if the user has
      supplied one. This fixes a regression introduced by yours truly a
      couple of years ago.

6.44  Sat Sep 25 23:34:11 GMT 2010
    - Don't fail on IRC servers where a whole class of channel modes is
      unsupported (e.g. Bitlbee).

6.43  Sat Sep 25 21:30:36 GMT 2010
    - State.pm: Don't forget to call IRC.pm's implementation of S_disconnected
      before our own. Due to this, the logged_in() method was reporting
      incorrect information after disconnecting.

6.42  Sat Sep 25 09:40:21 UTC 2010
    - ISupport.pm: Don't send a premature irc_isupport event on networks
      which send us numerics higher than 005 before the actual 005 (e.g Rizon)
    - NickServID.pm: Send an 'irc_identified' event when we've identified with
      NickServ. In addition, be a little more permissive when determining if
      we have identified. Works with Rizon now.

6.41  Thu Sep 23 21:33:17 UTC 2010
    - Don't use qw() as parentheses, it's deprecated in 5.13.4
    - Drop CTCPs which don't have a closing delimiter

6.40  Thu Sep 9 06:55:27 UTC 2010
    - AutoJoin.pm: Wait for a reply from NickServ before joining channels
      on connect

6.39  Sat Sep 4 02:16:28 UTC 2010
    - AutoJoin.pm: Allow channel keys to be undefined
    - Make the 'nickserv' command do the right thing on ratbox ircds
    - Add a server_version() method

6.38  Fri Sep 3 18:33:50 UTC 2010
    - Only process the first CTCP chunk we find in a message. This prevents
      someone from flooding our outgoing queue by having us e.g. reply to 20
      VERSION requests at a time.
    - CTCP.pm: Reply to VERSION with "dev-git" when no version is available.

6.37  Tue Aug 17 22:53:22 GMT 2010
    - Make all warnings fatal
    - Use real temp files in tests instead of littering the dist directory

6.36  Mon Jul 26 03:53:50 GMT 2010
    - Added a logged_in() method to see if we're logged into IRC

6.35  Sun Jun 27 09:32:22 GMT 2010
    - Disconnecting.pod: Mention when it is appropriate to use
      C<< $irc->yield('shutdown') >>.
    - Connector.pm: Clear the reconnect timer when the plugin is deleted so
      that we can actually shut down the IRC component.
    - Depend on POE::Component::Pluggable 1.26 for irc_plugin_error

6.34  Fri Jun 25 18:16:40 GMT 2010
    - CTCP.pm: Do "use POE::Component::IRC;" to avoid weird failures when
      this plugin is compiled by code which hasn't done the same.

6.33  Mon Jun 21 20:27:42 GMT 2010
    - BotCommand.pm: Allow user to choose how help messages are delivered
    - BotCommand.pm: Require the command prefix in private messages
    - BotCommand.pm: Make the help messages more context-sensitive
    - BotCommand.pm: Add support for custom auth checks
    - BotCommand.pm: If Eat == 1, we eat everything that looks like a command
    - Cookbook: Add Gtk2 example by Damian Kaczmarek
    - Logger.pm: Support a hook for custom log storage
    - IRC.pm: Remove redundant version() method
    - Convert distribution over to Dist::Zilla

6.32  Tue May 11 13:43:50 GMT 2010
    - IRC.pm: Filter out \r in arguments to non-PRIVMSG commands too
    - IRC.pm: Uppercase REHASH/DIE/RESTART commands before sending them
    - IRC.pm: Simplify privmsg handler and remove undocumented behavior of
      concatenating multiple messages.

6.30  Mon May 10 14:34:54 GMT 2010
    - Proxy.pm: Fix documentation error ('bindaddr' -> 'bindaddress')
    - IRC.pm: Split long messages on \r as well as \n. Plugs a security hole.

6.28  Sun Mar 14 10:50:43 GMT 2010
    - Use utf8 encoding in all Pod
    - Cookbook: Replace the MegaHAL recipe with a Hailo one
    - Stop using Module::Install::AuthorTests since M::I 0.94 handles it
      automatically for us

6.26  Sun Mar 14 07:32:23 GMT 2010
    - Depend on POE 1.287 for FollowTail bugfixes
    - Updated documentation to mention advice about avoiding the double
      encoding of non-ASCII channel names
    - Logger.pm: Avoid double-encoding non-ASCII channel names in logs

6.24  Fri Feb 12 02:45:21 GMT 2010
    - NickServID.pm: Identification wasn't working after the change a couple
      of releases ago. Thanks to John O'Brien in RT #54530. (Hinrik)

6.22  Wed Jan 20 01:50:23 GMT 2010
    - Logger.pm: The 'Restricted' switch had the opposite of the documented
      effect. Fixed that and also changed the default to true, so nobody who
      used the default will see a change. (Hinrik)

6.20  Fri Jan 15 18:38:44 GMT 2010
    - NickServID.pm: Identify correctly when switching nicks on ratbox IRC
      servers (Hinrik)
    - Common.pm: Encode::Guess::guess_encoding() doesn't work well with
      'UTF-8', revert back to 'utf8'. Added tests for it. (Hinrik)
    - CTCP.pm: It was sending "ARRAY(0x#######)" in reply to CTCP PING.
      Fixed it and added test for that and CTCP TIME. (Hinrik).
    - Depend on POE 1.284 so we won't get FAIL test reports from CPAN testers
      because of the FollowTail plugin. (Hinrik)

6.18  Fri Dec 11 19:23:24 GMT 2009
    - NickReclaim.pm: Reclaim nick immediately when possible (Hinrik)
    - Depend on POE::Filter::IRCD 2.42. Fixes parsing of 005 numeric replies
      from some servers (Hinrik)

    - BotTraffic.pm: Emit 'irc_bot_notice' events for bot notices (Hinrik)
    - Logger.pm: Log NOTICEs if requested (Hinrik)
    - Proxy.pm: Fix a regression introduced in 6.05_01. This was causing it
      to be completely broken. Added a test so it won't happen again
      unnoticed (Hinrik)

6.14  Thu Sep 24 15:07:05 GMT 2009
    - More "return" -> "return PCI_EAT_NONE" fixes. This eliminates some
      harmless (but annoying) warnings. (Hinrik)
    - State.pm: Fix AwayPoll, which wasn't working at all. Also added a
      test for it and made the documentation clearer. Thanks to David E.
      Wheeler for spotting that one. (Hinrik)
    - IRC.pm: Document which spawn() options can not be passed to the
      'connect' event. (Hinrik)
    - IRC.pm: Split PRIVMSGs with newlines into multiple messages. For other
      commands, don't pass user-supplied newlines through to the IRC server
      as it allows the user to submit raw IRC commands. (Hinrik)

6.12  Thu Sep 10 09:25:02 BST 2009
    - Fix localaddr() issue reported in RT #48791 by Michael Andreen
    - Depend on latest (1.24) POE::Component::Pluggable (Hinrik)
    - BotCommand.pm: Strip colors/formatting before processing (Hinrik)

    - Implemented netsplit detection and handling of state on netjoin (bingos)
    - Refactored the netsplit code for robustness and sanity (bingos)
    - Added testcase for netsplit handling (bingos)
    - AutoJoin.pm: Fixed problem with rejoining password-protected channels
      that were not passed to the plugin constructor (Hinrik)
    - Removed extended debug output from some tests, they've been behaving
      for a while (Hinrik)
    - State and subclasses will use NAMES replies to synchronise
      channel state as well now. Should help RT #46825 (bingos).
    - Refactored the netsplit test slightly to try and eliminate
      race conditions (bingos)
    - Added netsplit detection code to Qnet::State subclass. (bingos)
    - Netsplit restoration now triggers irc_nick_sync event (bingos)
    - Added some diagnostics to the netsplit test. (bingos)
    - Markup test in netsplit as todo due to race condition (bingos)
    - Mark one of the netsplit tests TODO (bingos)
    - Time for a stable release

      handlers, removes some warnings (Hinrik)

    - PlugMan.pm: Don't rely on State.pm for authentication. Eliminates race
      condition when receiving channel commands before the channel has been
      synced (Hinrik)
    - In jailed environments we can't assume that 127.0.0.1 will be that.
      reported by Jase Thew (Bazerka).
    - Logger.pm: Replace slashes with underscores before logging to disk,
      spotted by Sebastian Mair.

6.05_01 Sat Apr 11 09:18:28 GMT 2009

    - CTCP.pm: Use portable strftime parameters when responding to CTCP TIME
      requests (Hinrik)
    - State.pm: Document the extra parameters to irc_disconnected, irc_error,

    - Added more tests for general IRC activity, and for State.pm (Hinrik)
    - Added tests for BotCommand and Logger plugin (Hinrik)
    - Turned off flood control in all the tests, and removed or adjusted many
      of the delays used. This shaves about 70% off the time needed for a full
      test suite run (Hinrik)

5.98 Mon Mar  2 22:51:27 GMT 2009
    - Parse some IRC protocol messages more strictly. Always split on ASCII
      space rather than \s, since tabs are not considered whitespace by the
      IRC protocol. (Hinrik)
    - DCC.pm: Most events now tell you what the peer's IP address is (Hinrik)
    - DCC.pm: Document the timeout parameter to the dcc command, and fixed
      some errors in the docs. (Hinrik)
    - Compat.pm/DCC.pm: Actually provide the whole nick!user@host (not just
      the nick) with every dcc_request, like the synopsis suggests (Hinrik)
    - DCC.pm: Fix crash when closing a DCC connection with pending outgoing
      data, reported by meneldor (Hinrik)

    - DCC.pm: Don't crash if dcc_close is called with an invalid id, also
      reported by meneldor (Hinrik)
    - Logger.pm: Add DCC chat logging (Hinrik)
    - IRC.pm: Document the 'account' key returned by irc_whois (Hinrik)

      work properly now >:) Thanks to mst and dngor.
    - ::State, nick_sync now has the channel name as ARG1.
    - Moved the INVEX and EXCEPTS sync'ing until we are +o'd,
      created irc_chan_sync_(invex|excepts). irc_chan_sync
      features the time in seconds taken to sync as ARG1 now.

4.91  Thu Jun 01 21:08:13 BST 2006
    - Tweak to ::State to deal with ircds that don't report @+
      status in WHO replies ( like unreal ). Thanks to Lyndon Miller
      for reporting that.
    - 'irc_dcc_failed' event was undocumented. Fixed.
    - Switched the poco-client-dns checks to 'use', so as to
      ensure that we only load >= 0.99.
    - Amendments to shutdown so that it sends a quit message
      to the ircd if we are connected.
    - Amended Connector plugin so the lag is collected
      independent of what the ircd sends us back.
    - Various changes to ::State in order to ensure full RFC
      compliant channel mode support, including support
      for channel access lists - Lyndon Miller
    - Added ::State methods to return channel access lists:
      channel_ban_list, channel_invex_list, channel_except_list - Lyndon Miller
    - Using 'use' for the dns checks was fubar. Switched back
      to 'require' and test the VERSION instead.
    - Changed the simpleclient.pl script to accept a filename as
      a second argument to /dump_state command.
    - Documentation tweaks to ::State by Lyndon Miller
    - Channel topic support added to ::State. Added the method
      channel_topic to return a hashref of topic data - Lyndon Miller
    - Changed 'Time' keys for channel lists and topic to 'SetAt'
    - Added irc_chan_mode event to ::State to allow everyone
      to enjoy the mode parsing State does internally - Lyndon Miller
    - Refactored ::Qnet::State subclass after all - Lyndon Miller
      changes to ::State.
    - Refactored ::State slightly to use ARG2 for numerics
      handlers instead of trying to parse ARG1 ourselves. FTW.

      a connect() without parameters was called.

4.69  Mon Sep 05 12:30:01 BST 2005

      prioritisation into the plugin system. Check Plugin.pm and
      Pipeline.pm for details.

4.65  Wed Jul 13 17:47:08 BST 2005
    - Fixed the anamoly where plugins weren't deleted if shutdown()
      is called. This should fix plugins that based around POE::Session.

    - Fixed POD in Plugin::BotAddressed.
    - Added BotTraffic.pm plugin.

    - Applied another ketas patch.
    - Added BotAddressed plugin.
    - Added ::Test::Plugin.
    - Added ::Test::Harness, PoCo-Server-IRC in disguise :)
    - Added tests for the ::Test::*

    - Applied patch from ketas.
    - Fixed docs for DCCPorts parameter to connect().
    - Removed State.pm plugin as it was becoming difficult to
      keep in sync with State subclass. Eventually hope to replace
      State subclass with a proper plugin wrapper.
    - Relocated constants to Constants.pm, tidied up subclasses.
    - Added Connector.pm plugin. See docs for details.
    - PoCo-IRC will now send an 'irc_registered' event to
      registering sessions. ARG0 will the poco's object.

4.4   Thu Apr 28 15:16:03 BST 2005
    - Added event handlers for PING and PONG IRC commands.
    - Added connected() method, so punters can query if the
      component is connected to an IRC server or not.
    - Applied a patch from Apocalypse re: DNS and SSL.
    - Fixed Filter::IRC so it now parses PONG properly.
    - ketas pointed out that in State.pm, the state for a

4.3   Wed Apr 20 09:25:21 BST 2005
    - Added 'irc_raw' events and parameter to spawn/connect() to
      enable them. Thanks to webfox for the idea.

    - Fixed a minor bug in Filter-IRC.pm, where it wasn't
      decoloning the mode line before splitting it.
      Thanks to webfox for pointing it out.
    - Used eval's to make plugins system safe from rogue
      plugins. *tssk* *tssk*
    - Plugins system will now try to send events to a plugin
      method _default() if the call to S_* or U_* fails.
    - Applied a patch from webfox to enable SSL
      connections. \o/
    - Ported SSL patch to all dependent sub-classes.
    - Teased and fixed a bug in IRC-State.pm. ban_mask()
      should work properly now.

3.8   Mon Mar 14 10:15:22 GMT 2005
    - Applied ketas' DCC patch, eventually.
    - Applied a patch from Zsolt Szalai, which adds support
      for Freenode's 320 whois response.
    - Added Apocalypse's port of IRC-State.pm using the plugin
      API, Plugin-State.pm.
    - Added my plugin for 'irc_whois' and 'irc_whowas'
      functionality.
    - Fixed all the necessary modules to use Whois plugin.

3.7   Fri Mar 04 17:37:34 GMT 2005
    - Applied massive patch from Apocalypse @ MAGnet that
      adds plugins. Read the docs in Plugins.pm for more info.
    - Corrected some grammar mistakes in Plugins.pm >:o)
    - Amended IRC-State.pm so that 'irc_nick' and 'irc_quit'
      have an additional parameter in ARG2 which is an
      arrayref of channels that are common with the component.

3.6   Tue Mar 01 17:47:05 GMT 2005 "Y Adeilad Daffydd-Sant"
				   ( The Saint David Build(ing) )
    - Applied ketas' patch to IRC-State. Adds channel_modes
      method and some code tidying.
    - Spotted that in some cases the component *needs* an
      alias. Made it use an internal alias unless one is
      specified.
    - Applied another ketas patch to IRC.pm, puts a
      friendly message when we can't allocate a DCC port.
    - Updated IRC-Qnet-State.pm to use a 'querytype' in the
      extended WHO command, to specify <channel> or <nick>
      WHO queries, due to spurious channels appearing in the
      state. Big thanks to MikeC @ Qnet for the pointers.

3.5   Wed Feb 23 13:28:05 GMT 2005
    - IRC-State bug spotted and patched by ketas @ MAGnet
    - Same bug caught and squashed in IRC-Qnet-State by me.
    - Sorted out DCCPorts. It has to be an arrayref now.

3.4   Fri Feb 18 12:01:58 GMT 2005
    - Deprecated new() in favour of new constructor spawn().
      spawn() will except all the same parameters as connect().
      Moved config stuff to _configure() to save duplication.
    - Changed all the object constructors about. Bit tedious
      but now it is alot easier to subclass. See _create().
    - Added a hack for $self->session_id(). Made 'alias'
      optional if used with 'spawn'.
    - Added parameter NATPort so one can specify the NAT
      address that a bot appears to other IRC clients as
      for DCC transfers, etc.
    - Added DCCPorts parameter so that one can specify a
      range of ports to use for initiating DCC, instead of
      using 0.
    - Implemented and added subclass ::State which provides
      nickname and channel tracking. \o/
    - Implemented and added subclass ::Qnet::State the ::State
      ported to the Qnet module.
    - Fixed the event dispatchers in _sock_up and _sock_down to
      use _send_event like everyone else. Danke to Apocalypse for
      spotting that. Amended _send_event so that 'irc_connected'
      and 'irc_disconnected' get sent to every session not just
      those that ask for it, as was the original behaviour.
    - Documentation updates for all the new stuff.
    - Added CVSLOG which contains all the glorious changes in
      developing this thingy. :)
    - Added send_queue() method, as I noticed that merlyn's
      logfile tailing code was accessing the heap and i moved all
      heap stuff to the object. *sigh* hacked it so that $heap holds
      a reference to $self->{send_queue} which should work.

3.3   Wed Feb 02 14:07:03 GMT 2005
    - Updated IRC-Qnet to a). support new whois/whowas;
      b). support irc_330 which is the account on ircu.

3.2   Wed Feb 02 11:00:59 GMT 2005
    - Implemented 'irc_whois' and 'irc_whowas' which
      gather all the salient data from the numeric replies
      and send one event containing a hashref.
      As suggested by numerous bods on #PoE @ MAGnet >;o)

3.1   Fri Jan 21 11:59:56 GMT 2005
    - Converted _send_event sub to object method.
    - Added IRC-Qnet, with specific extensions for Quakenet.
    - Updated README

3.0   Fri Dec 31 09:00:01 GMT 2004
    - Fixed Filter-IRC so that it groks WALLOPS properly.
    - Added docs/ and populated it with rfcs applicable to IRC.
    - Added a slightly more substantial test case, moved it to t/
    - Converted use of HEAP to OBJECT. PoCo-IRC is *now* an object.
    - Added a fix for the infamous PART bug. Has to be explicitly enabled
      by specifying PartFix => 1 in the 'connect' handler.
    - Added a switch to 'connect' so that the use of PoCo::Client::DNS
      can be disabled if necessary.
    - Applied the outstanding patches:
	- PoCo::Client::DNS patch by Jim Westfall
	- DCC Resume patch by Bruno Boettcher
	- Flood doc patch by Rocco Caputo
	- Debug param patch by Paul Visscher
	- Proxy Support patch by Jeff Pinyan
	- Locops patch by Jon Nistor

========== Maintainership changed from Fimm to BinGOs ====================

2.9   Sat Jul 19 13:32:45 PDT 2003
    - Only one change this time: Adam Foxson's patch to add prioritized
      notices.

2.8   Sat Jun  7 16:13:25 PDT 2003
    - Applied dngor's mega-patch, which fixes (among other things): a
      fix for a nasty lockup, improved error reporting, and better flood
      control.
    - Fixed some broken URLs and a couple mistakes in the documentation.

2.7   Sun Feb  2 15:05:28 PST 2003
    - Fixed up the example scripts to play nicer with POE's new signal
      handling. Thanks to dngor for bringing this up.
    - Added a patch by lunartear to properly handle spaces in DCC filenames.
    - Fixed a bug reported by Robert Rendler regarding CTCP quoting
      accidentally duplicating backslashes.

2.6   Wed Dec 11 20:27:51 PST 2002
    - Brian Kelly thoughtfully pointed out an URL in the documentation
      that was being mangled by pod2html. Should look better now.
    - Added a note about handling CTCP actions to the POD documentation,
      since that seems to be a source of confusion for a lot of people.
    - Added a 'list' event, which I seem to have overlooked entirely
      until now. Thanks to J.D. McCown for pointing it out.
    - Attempted to add Jim Westfall's asynchronous DNS patch, but I
      really need to learn a little more about IPv6 before I attempt to
      port somebody else's code to it. Hopefully in the next release.

2.5   Sun Oct 27 11:03:57 PST 2002
    - Added an AIM <-> IRC proxy bot to the example scripts. Share and enjoy!
    - I just now noticed that POE::Component::IRC sessions never get
      garbage-collected. DOH. Now you can send them "shutdown" events to
      make them go away. Too bad it's probably too late to be breaking
      backwards compatibility on this... sigh.
    - Added a bug fix from Trym Skaar (those Norwegians get the coolest
      names!) which fixes a potential crash while closing DCC connections.
    - Added a mega-patch from the unstoppable Rocco Caputo which prioritizes
      messages sent to the IRC server by importance. This ensures that
      pings and login information will always keep flowing, even if your
      bot's inane chatter has been throttled.

2.4   Thu Oct 10 14:22:04 PDT 2002
    - Added a patch from dngor to fix a crash caused by IRC servers
      sometimes inexplicably sending a blank line.
    - Added a patch from Jim Westfall which speeds up DCC file transfers
      by a couple orders of magnitude. Yay, Jim!

2.3   Fri Sep  6 07:59:50 PDT 2002
    - Fixed a rare "uninitialized value" warning in oneoptarg().
    - Added a patch from Trym Skaar which makes sure that DCC buffers
      are flushed before closing a connection. Thanks, Trym!

    - dngor found an excellent page about IRC server numeric codes,
      which I added a link to in the documentation.
    - dngor also gave me two more patches: one to avoid some deprecation
      warnings introduced in the latest version of POE, and another
      which fixed a bug in one of his earlier patches. He's such a stud.

2.1   Mon Mar  4 17:06:03 PST 2002
    - Added a long-buried patch from thefly to fix IRCnet channel name
      parsing. Sorry about the long turnaround on that one.
    - Applied Scott Beck's patch to Rocco's refcount patch. The whole
      "sessions not being GCed" brain-damage should be fixed now.

2.0   Fri Feb 22 15:23:23 PST 2002
    - Rocco Caputo gave me two patches to apply; the first was a fix to
      his earlier output throttling patch, and the second was a snippet
      of code that will allow bot-writers to avoid having to set aliases
      on their control sessions to keep them alive. Cool!

1.9   Wed Dec 12 22:44:13 PST 2001
    - David Dollar pointed out a bug with DCC using the wrong interface
      on multihomed hosts. Easy fix.

1.8   Mon Dec 10 16:04:06 PST 2001
    - Applied dngor's studly patch to throttle line output.
    - Fixed a bug that would cause events to get thrown away if they
      came in while the connection to the IRC server was down.

1.7   Sat Jul 21 00:46:06 PDT 2001
    - Fixed bugs in my initial implementations of the irc_invite event.
      Sigh. You ever have one of those days where you can't do anything
      right? Thanks again to the exceedingly patient Rasmus Hansen for
      pointing out that my updated version still didn't work right.
    - Fixed a bug in 'dcc_close' which prevented it from calling
      'irc_dcc_done' handlers properly.

1.5   Thu Jul  5 15:24:31 PDT 2001
    - Added an irc_invite event -- I knew I'd forgotten something!
      Thanks to Rasmus Hansen for the bug report.
    - Fixed a bug in topic() that would accidentally clear the topic
      when trying to query it. More thanks to Rasmus Hansen.

1.4   Mon Jul  2 17:10:59 PDT 2001
    - One of the fixes in 1.3 broke newline handling horribly, such that
      it was sending two sets of line terminators on every line. I am a
      doofus. Patched by Rocco Caputo.

1.3   Sat Jun 30 17:29:30 PDT 2001
    - The Indomitable Mark-Jason "Ominous" Dominus sent me so many
      patches and bug reports I'm almost at a loss to list them all.
      Among others, DCC SENDs no longer report the local pathname to the
      client on the other end, multiple concurrent DCC connections work,
      and some documentation errors have been fixed.
    - Many thanks to the infinitely studly Kees Cook, who, in addition
      to having a really cool name, sent me a big patch for lots of DCC
      bugs. DCC connections will now report errors and close their
      sockets properly! Woohoo! Also, 'irc_dcc_error' events give you
      more information about the connection that failed, and the
      'dcc_accept' event now lets you rename incoming DCC files.
    - Fixed a silly bug; sl() was sending \n instead of \r\n as a line
      terminator.
    - Changed lots of Filter::CTCP die()s to warn()s, on the advice of
      Peter Barabas. Thanks, Peter!

1.2   Thu May 24 02:36:40 PDT 2001
    - I have learned a valuable lesson about not including debugging
      prints in released code. Especially when the debugging code in
      question consists of somewhat vulgar inside jokes. :-)

1.1   Fri Mar  2 03:07:01 PST 2001
    - A couple patches from Jonathan Steinert: 'ctcp', 'privmsg', and
      'notice' will join() their arguments together with spaces, and
      'kick' will no longer accidentally concatenate the nick onto the
      kick message. Thanks, Jon!

1.0   Wed Feb 21 15:09:56 PST 2001
    - Split 'irc_ctcp' messages into 'irc_ctcp' and 'irc_ctcpreply'.
      My thanks to Jonathan Steinert.
    - Rocco "dngor" Caputo fixed up my DCC code for me, which was so
      broken as to exercise POE::Kernel bugs. :-) With his fixes in
      mind, I rewrote pretty much all the DCC stuff; it's much less
      hairy now.
    - Added 'dcc_chat' and 'dcc_accept' commands.
    - Moved all scripts into the "examples" directory and added a dummy
      test.pl, so it won't hang during CPAN installations anymore.
    - Worked around a bug in POE versions <0.1201, which caused DCC
      SEND/GET connections not to properly respond to pending data.
    - DCC connections should function properly now. Let me know if you
      experience problems.

1.0b  Sat Jan 13 14:49:22 PST 2001
    - This is a beta release. It may not entirely work, and DCC receive
      is still unimplemented. I'll list the bugs I remember fixing below.
      1.0 final will have DCC receive capability, I promise!
    - CTCP event names are now in the form of "irc_ctcp_ping" or
      whatever. See the POD documentation.
    - CTCP events now actually include the sender and recipient names.
    - The infamous "Not an ARRAY reference" bug should now go away. Make
      sure you're using a recent version of POE! Turned out it was a bug
      in POE::Filter::Line.

0.15  Tue Aug 10 19:21:58 EDT 1999
    - Well, it sucked for the first revision, at least. In my eager haste,
      I released the CTCP code with numerous debugging prints scattered
      throughout the source, some serious brokenness in mixed-mode
      messages, and a totally unimplemented put() method. All fixed! You
      can now actually send CTCP messages with the 'ctcp' and 'ctcpreply'
      events. Now to hack on DCC...

0.14  Sun Aug  8 18:29:46 EDT 1999
    - Wrote documentation for POE::Filter::IRC.
    - Moved Filter.pm to Filter-IRC.pm, in preparation for adding a
      CTCP filter.
    - Addi <amh@mbl.is> fixed a nasty bug with public/msg handling in
      the Filter-IRC module. I am SUCH a neen.
    - Finally sat down and wrote the bloody CTCP filter, at long last.
      Don't be surprised if it sucks for the first few revisions... the
      last one I wrote did, too. On the other hand, this uses big chunks
      of the working code from that effort, so maybe I'll get lucky this
      time.

0.13  Fri Jun  4 03:56:13 EDT 1999
    - Split the parser off into a separate POE::Filter::IRC module.
      The surgery was surprisingly easy, but I had to do an ugly
      Makefile.PL hack to get it to install correctly.

0.12  Fri Jun  4 01:16:55 EDT 1999
    - Wrote a nice README, finally.
    - Fixed a bug in the test.pl script where I accidentally referred
      to the 'irc_disconnected' event as 'irc_disconnect'. No wonder it
      wasn't shutting down properly.

0.11  Thu Jun  3 18:41:51 EDT 1999
    - Spruced up the parser's regexps with a lot of " +"'s.
    - Turned off all the massively verbose debugging code.
    - Realized that I need to write a README.

0.1   Thu Jun  3 16:55:24 EDT 1999
    - Completely functional, minus CTCP and DCC.

0.1a  Mon May 17 09:11:48 EDT 1999
    - Released for a little private QA to oznoid and dngor. Moderately
      functional. Can send every command (I think), and has a
      half-written parser that handles the most common IRC events, and
      a few which it wasn't meant to handle.
