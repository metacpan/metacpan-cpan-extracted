0.11    2022-07-13
        [CHANGES]
         * Updates for Object::Pad 0.57
            + Use `:does` attribute rather than `does` subkeyword
         * Use Commandable for ARGV handling - gives automatic help, better
           parse support, generally nicer

0.10    2021-08-25
        [CHANGES]
         * Fix some (harmless) warnings that would otherwise become apparent
           after Object::Pad RT139027 bugfix

0.09    2021-07-17
        [CHANGES]
         * Support multiple commands to avr-updi; useful for writing
           flash+EEPROM in a single command
         * Convert to using Object::Pad
         * Much faster write performance, by disabling per-byte responses
           during sending
         * No need to reset chip after reading fuses
         * Reset chip only once after all write operations are done

        [BUGFIXES]
         * Better support for AVR Dx chips by using 24bit addressing
         * Handle sparse .hex files by filling in holes with 0xFF
