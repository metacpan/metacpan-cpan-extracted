    HTTP::Tiny::UNIX - A subclass of HTTP::Tiny to connect to HTTP server
    over Unix socket

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.051 of HTTP::Tiny::UNIX (from Perl
    distribution HTTP-Tiny-UNIX), released on 2018-05-08.

SYNOPSIS
     use HTTP::Tiny::UNIX;

     my $response = HTTP::Tiny::UNIX->new->get('http:/path/to/unix.sock//uri/path');

     die "Failed!\n" unless $response->{success};
     print "$response->{status} $response->{reason}\n";

     while (my ($k, $v) = each %{$response->{headers}}) {
         for (ref $v eq 'ARRAY' ? @$v : $v) {
             print "$k: $_\n";
         }
     }

     print $response->{content} if length $response->{content};

DESCRIPTION
    This is a subclass of HTTP::Tiny to connect to HTTP server over Unix
    socket. URL syntax is "http:" + *path to unix socket* + "/" + *uri
    path*. For example: "http:/var/run/apid.sock//api/v1/matches". URL not
    matching this pattern will be passed to HTTP::Tiny.

    Proxy is currently not supported.
