Texinfo-Menus version 1.03, released September 28, 2013

Texinfo::Menus updates the menus and node links in a Texinfo file
based on its chapter structure. The file may use `@include' to include
other files, which may also `@inlcude' other files. Unlike the similar
Emacs functions, Texinfo::Menus does not require that each chapter be
in a separate file.
