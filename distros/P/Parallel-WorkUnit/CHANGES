1.118 - May 28, 2018
Joelle Maslak <jmaslak@antelope.net>

1.116 - Mar 24, 2018
Joelle Maslak <jmaslak@antelope.net>

1.114 - Mar 23, 2018
Joelle Maslak <jmaslak@antelope.net>
 * Properly handle nested workunit() calls
 * Adjust Demolish warning - Parent PID will no longer be the check now
   that we can handle nesting properly - all child processes have
   workunit variables properly cleared.
 * Released as DEV (TRIAL) version for CPAN Testers validation

1.113 - Mar 23, 2018
Joelle Maslak <jmaslak@antelope.net>
 * Add test on queue() and async() to validate that params were coderefs
   (or "coderef like")

   running processes
 * Released as DEV (TRIAL) version for CPAN Testers validation

1.112 - Feb 23, 2018
Joelle Maslak <jmaslak@antelope.net>
 * Released as prod version with 1.111 fixes

1.111 - Feb 22, 2018
Joelle Maslak <jmaslak@antelope.net>
 * Minor documentation update (remove reference to "ordered" attribute)
 * Storable in 5.27.9 now supports (experimentally) regexp freezing,
   which caused a test to fail (we tested that if a regexp was returned
   from a child, that should have thrown an exception - which most version
   of storable do).
 * Released as DEV (TRIAL) version for CPAN Testers validation

1.110 - Jan 8, 2018
Joelle Maslak <jmaslak@antelope.net>
 * Provide ordered response support (spawn work units, have the
   results put into an array in order of spawning of the work units)

1.100 - Dec 16, 2017
Joelle Maslak <jmaslak@antelope.net>
 * First release version with AnyEvent support

1.015 - Dec 15, 2017
Joelle Maslak <jmaslak@antelope.net>
 * Switch from Thread::Queue to socket pairs to allow select() on
   Windows when AnyEvent::Util::portable_pipe is available.
 * Use native Perl fork emulation when AnyEvent::Util::portable_pipe
   is available
 * Released as DEV (TRIAL) version for CPAN Testers validation

1.014 - Dec 13, 2017
Joelle Maslak <jmaslak@antelope.net>
 * Use AnyEvent::Util::portable_pipe on Windows when using available,
   as EV and other event loops can't select on pipes on Windows
 * Released as DEV (TRIAL) version for CPAN Testers validation

1.013 - Dec 12, 2017
Joelle Maslak <jmaslak@antelope.net>
 * Support AnyEvent (optionally, not required)
 * Released as DEV (TRIAL) version for CPAN Testers validation

1.012 - Oct 26, 2017
Joelle Maslak <jmaslak@antelope.net>
 * Minor test updates

1.011 - Oct 26, 2017
Joelle Maslak <jmaslak@antelope.net>
 * Worker pool implimentation
 * Minor documentation changes
 * Released as DEV version

1.010 - Jun 22, 2016
Joelle Maslak <jmaslak@antelope.net>
 * Add Travis CI configuration
 * Change author name

1.009 - Apr 23, 2016
Joelle Maslak <jmaslak@antelope.net>
 * Switched from TryCatch to Try::Tiny to maintain compatibility
   with Perl 5.24.0-RC1 (TryCatch depends on Scope::Upper which
   was broken by perl core changes)

1.008 - Mar 13, 2016
Joelle Maslak <jmaslak@antelope.net>
 * Win32: Really fix the compatibility issue.  There is no
   select() on Win32 that works with sockets, so we simulate
   this with Thread::Queue (Thanks, CPAN Testers!)

1.007 - Mar 7, 2016
Joelle Maslak <jmaslak@antelope.net>
 * Win32: Fix Win32 compatibility issue introduced in 1.006.
   (Thanks, CPAN Testers!)
 * Win32: waitone() no longer waits only for the first running
   thread to stop but waits instead for the first finishing
   thread.

1.006 - Mar 2, 2016
Joelle Maslak <jmaslak@antelope.net>
 * Add waitone() method, which allows you to wait for one and exactly
   one child thread to return.  This is useful in building worker
   pools.
 * Add count() method, which returns the number of outstanding
   threads running or waiting to send output.  This is also usesful
   for building worker pools.

1.005 - July 15, 2015
Joelle Maslak <jmaslak@antelope.net>
 * This version doesn't have any functionality changes from 1.002
 * This beats up the smoke tests hosts (particularly Windows and
   Solaris) a lot less, by spawning fewer processes during tests.

1.004 - July 13, 2015
Joelle Maslak <jmaslak@antelope.net>
 * Correct missing tests in 1.003

1.003 - July 13, 2015
Joelle Maslak <jmaslak@antelope.net>
 * This version doesn't have any functionality changes from 1.002
 * A test failed on some shells due to insecure $ENV in taint mode
 * Minor documentation changes

1.002 - July 12, 2015
Joelle Maslak <jmaslak@antelope.net>
 * Windows compatibility fixes
 * Don't use SIG{CHLD} = 'IGNORE'
     (bug 105823, reported by SREZIC)
 * Relaxed Perl minimum version requirements
     (bug 105824, reported by SREZIC)
 * Returned better error messages in cases where freeze() fails
     (bug 105825, reported by SREZIC)
 * Minor code cleanup/formatting

1.001 - July 12, 2015
Joelle Maslak <jmaslak@antelope.net>
 * Changed behavior for reads, so that the return value can be ready by
   multiple read() calls.  This aids robustness if a signal comes in at
   a bad time, particularly in Perl 5.14.
