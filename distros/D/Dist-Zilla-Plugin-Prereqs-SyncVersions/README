Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Prereqs::SyncVersions

This module exists to pose mostly as a workaround for potential bugs in
downstream tool-chains.

Namely, "CPAN.pm" is confused when it sees:

    runtime.requires : Foo >= 5.0
    test.requires    : Foo >= 6.0

It doesn't know what to do.

This is an easy enough problem to solve if you're using "[Prereqs]"
directly, and "[AutoPrereqs]" already does the right thing, but it gets
messier when you're working with plugins that inject their own
prerequisites
<https://github.com/dagolden/Path-Tiny/commit/c620171db96597456a182ea608
8a24d8de5debf6>

So this plugin will homogenize dependencies to be the same version in
all phases which infer the dependency, matching the largest one found,
so the above becomes:

    runtime.requires : Foo >= 6.0
    test.requires    : Foo >= 6.0
