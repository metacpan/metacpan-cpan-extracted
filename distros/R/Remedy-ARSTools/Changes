Revision history for Perl extension Remedy::ARSTools.


1.23	Thu Jun  6 12:47:00 CDT 2019
	fixed bug in CheckFields on epoch conversion for Date fields

1.22	Tue Mar 12 14:16:21 CDT 2019
	enum values may contain chars that will hork up the non-case-sensitive regex match.
	this fix does an || <val> eq <enum> to end around that.
	
1.21	Fri Jan 15 10:56:23 CST 2016
	when LoadARSConfig() detects a stale config (or missing schema) it will now MERGE the missing
	data into the config file, rather than blow away the old one and replace it with a new one
	containing only the missing data. To think I lived with so many unnecessary config loads
	for all these years ... 
	
	necessity may be the mother of invention but irritation is surely the mother of innovation.

1.20	Fri Sep 18 14:36:44 CDT 2015
	ARSTools object now sets '_API_Message' attribute when non-fatal API messages
	are received from the ARServer (you don't have to set the debug mode to see them now)

1.19	Thu Sep 17 14:32:05 CDT 2015
	added JoinFormPostSubmitQuery support to PushFields (so you can now PushFields onto a join form and not have to use
	the automated query to find the thing you submitted).

1.18	Mon Sep 29 10:23:48 CDT 2014
	* fixed bug in ConvertFieldsToHumanReadable causing null enum field values to evaluate "0"

1.17    Wed Aug 20 13:30:15 CDT 2014
        * fixed bug in ConvertFieldsToHumanReadable causing null datetime, time_of_day and date values to be interpreted as "0"

1.16    Tue Jul  1 14:48:35 CDT 2014
        * fixed sort-order issue on CreateTicket where multiple results match the post-submit query for a 
          join form (previous to 1.16 the sort order was not consistent).

1.15    Fri May 30 11:41:50 CDT 2014
            
        * LoadARSConfig now captures "entry_mode" on field meta-data ("required", "optional", or "display-only")
        * LoadARSConfig now checks loaded cache files for missing schemas specified on object instantiation and refreshes config from server
        * CreateTicket (join form mode) now excludes display-only fields from post-submit query
        * CreateTicket (join form mode) now interpolates "" as $NULL$ in post-submit query
        * CreateTicket (join form mode) now allows override of auto-generated post-submit query qualification on JoinFormPostSubmitQuery option
		
1.14    Thu May 29 10:55:34 CDT 2014

        * bolted 'AlternateSortOrder' onto PushFields

1.13    Wed May 28 10:17:43 CDT 2014

        * fixed bug on CreateTicket, obscuring ARS::ars_errstr on submit to join form where 
          OverrideJoinSubmitQuery is set
			  
1.12    Tue May 27 10:04:08 CDT 2014

        * added MatchAction => "Nothing" to PushFields

1.11    Fri May 16 14:28:08 CDT 2014

        * added PushFields function
        * modified CreateTicket to deal with join forms
        * TO-DO: update the test suite for these two thangs ...

1.1     Mon May  5 11:18:28 CDT 2014

        * fixed typo in CreateTicket sub causing misleading errstr when required options missing

1.09    Tue Apr  8 08:31:29 CDT 2014

        * fixed regex on line 512, preventing CheckFields properly dealing with already-epoch-encoded datetime values

1.08    Wed Feb 26 13:45:57 CST 2014

        * fixed inverted logic in CheckFields / TruncateOK, prevented field lengths from being truncated
        * fixed error in CreateTicket causing CheckFields output to be returned instead of undef when CheckFields fails
        * fixed CheckFields date & time_of_day conversions to not die on NULL field values
                
         adding this to the to-do list
           
        * CoalesceRecords  -> add two records together, spit out complete record with updates
        * IntersectRecords -> take two records, spit out only the fields they have in common
        * SubtractRecords  -> take two records, spit out only the fields that are different
        * CompareRecord	   -> take two records, compare them. spit out a 1 if they're the same 0 if they're different

1.07    Mon Jan 27 16:49:06 CST 2014
        forgot to update dependencies in Makefile.PL to include Date::Parse and Time::Interval

1.06    Mon Jan 27 11:23:05 CST 2014

        * added automatic date, datetime & time_of_day string<->integer conversions on 
          CreateTicket, ModifyTicket, MergeTicket and Query
        * added ImportDefinition
        * added 'dataType' to cache field datastructure
        * added '__Remedy_ARSTools_Version' to cache datastructure
        * added automatic rebuild of cache for upgraded Remedy::ARSTools version
        * enhanced non-sequential custom enum decoding / encoding
        * added user-definable GMT offset for date/time conversions
        * enhanced ParseDBDiary to use datetime conversions
        * added EncodeDBDiary
        * added automatic diary datastructure -> string encoding for MergeTickets
        * added ExportDefinition
        * added TunnelSQL
        * added DeleteObjectFromServer
        * added more complete test suite w/optional test form import
            
        some things on my to-do list:
                  
            * FindFilterInGuides
              find all the filter guides containing the specified filter name
              
            * FindActiveLinkInGuides
              find all the active link guides containing the specified active link name
              
            * some kinda hack to make CreateTicket not return undef every time you create a ticket on a join form
              though presently I'm stumped. Querying by $LASTID$ in that scenario actually core dumped my 8.1 test arserver.
              suggestions welcome.
			  
1.05    Tue Jun 12 23:30:02 GMT 2012
        fixed bug in CheckFields causing enums to return null value match
                
1.04    Sat Apr 28 00:46:04 GMT 2012
        fixed CheckFields bug preventing ModifyTicket from setting a null value on an enum field.
        fixed the hacky duct-tape that was the 1.03 implementation of custom enum value lists with 
        the help mister John Zhang <jzhang@silverspringnet.com>. Thanks, man!

1.031   Sat Apr 28 00:46:04 GMT 2012
        fixed CheckFields bug preventing ModifyTicket from setting a null value on an enum field.

1.03    Fri Mar 23 16:49:48 EDT 2012
        LoadARSConfig now supports enums with custom value lists

1.02    Mon Nov 14 18:19:17 EST 2011
        added Merge function

1.01	Mon Jul 20 20:12:36 CDT 2009
	fixed problem with matching ARSPerl version number

1.0	Mon Nov 13 20:59:52 GMT 2006
	complete re-write. should work for all versions of ARSperl.
	a lot of things changed, a lot of things stayed the same.
	
		- now works without a config file (but faster WITH one)
		- reloads field definition data when missing config data
		- automatically reconnects on ARERR161 type errors
		- converts strings to integers for enum fields
		- removed snarky comments
		- rewrote documentation, removed even more snarky comments
		- removed 'timeout' option
		
0.92	Tue Oct 17 21:45:35 GMT 2006
        added 'timeout' option. If set, the control structure is reloaded if last access 
	was more than that long ago
	goddam this module needs a rewrite like a new set of drawers. it's FUNKY in there! ;-)

0.91	Tue Mar 21 16:16:25 GMT 2006	
	modified checkFieldLengths to accept blessed references on the Fields argument.

0.9	Fri Jul  9 09:46:50 EDT 2004
	well crap! 0.6 says I added truncate, but damn if I can find it in the code
	now ... added the TruncateOK => 1 option to CheckFieldLengths that will 
	truncate long fields. CreateTicket and ModifyTicket will pass this option
	allong to CheckFieldLengths.

0.8	01/30/04 16:12:02
	still carrying all the "things to do"
	CreateTicket now spews field value submissions in Debug mode

0.7 	05/12/03 21:50:47
	now exports procedural methods to calling namespace
	nothing else added/changed, so considder all the "things to do" 
        from .06 be the things to do for .08
	procrastination is the mother of intervention.

0.6	05/05/03 21:50:35
	added TruncateFieldLengths, and Truncate support to CreateTicket and ModifyTicket.
	Pod updated to reflect new options to CreateTicket and ModifyTicket.
	-Things To Do for 0.7:
		add docs to pod for actual TruncateFieldLengths method
		add better port switching via: ars_SetServerPort(ctrl, serverName, TCPport, RPCnumber)
		add the self-healing config
		legit test suite
		switch GenerateARSConfig to _GenerateARSConfig (fix autosplit problem)
	
0.5 	Wed 10/30/02 11:27:02
	initial release to CPAN under Remedy::ARSTools namespace
	added ParseDiay
    	added ParseDBDiary
	added support for auto-generating config files at object creation
	added support for auto-regenerating config files when fields not found
	modified RefreshConfig
	added GenerateConfig
	added GenerateARSConfig
	added GetFieldData
	-Still To Do:
	'AutoConfig' automatically refresh ConfigFile upon field data exceptions
	Write Test Suite.
	Make complains about GenerateConfig and GenerateARSConfig: that they are
	not unique when truncated to 8 chars. Fix in next release.
