=head1 DESCRIPTION

The C<git feature> command allows a simplified way to create and switch to
feature branches using whatever you define as the I<current release>.

By default I<current release> is defined as the I<origin/master> branch that
can be changed either on the command line using the --tag or --branch
arguments or by setting the C<workflow.prod> git config. Example of commonly
used alternatives include using release version tags where you might use
something like C<--tag ^v\d+[.]\d+'> to match tags like v0.1 or v1.0 etc.
Other examples include different branches containing release versions of
code.

The branch I<origin/master> is used over I<master> to save you from having
to switch to master and pull any new changes. A C<git fetch> is called by
default before branching to further ensure the latest version of code is
available.

=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

=head1 CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT

Defaults for this script can be set through C<git config>

 workflow.prod  Sets how a prod release is determined
                eg the default equivalent is branch=^origin/master$
 workflow.pom   The default location for the pom.xml file (used by C<--new-pom>
                when updating pom.xml for the new branch)
 workflow.pom-local
                Can set default value of C<--local>
 jira.url       Specifies the URL for the JIRA instance being used

You can set these values either by editing the repository local C<.git/config>
file or C<~/.gitconfig> or use the C<git config> command

 # eg Setting the global value
    git config --global workflow.prod 'branch=^origin/master$'

 # or set a repository's local value
    git config workflow.prod 'tag=^release_\d{4}_\d{2}\d{2}$'

 # or setting pom.xml location to a sub directory
    git config workflow.pom 'somedir/pom.xml'
