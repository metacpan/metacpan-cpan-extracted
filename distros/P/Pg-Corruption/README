Pg-Corruption version 0.01
==========================

 Checks if primary keys and foreign keys on a table are free of corruption, that
is it verifies that they enforce their constraint roles. Indexes are not used
to fetch heap values since, of course, we can't assume they function properly 
when it is this functionality that we want to verify. Tables with compound fk 
are not currently supported, but tables with multiple but non-compound fk
to other tables are supported.
