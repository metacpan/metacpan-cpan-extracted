=head1 NAME

with-sound - Command executor with sound


=head1 VERSION

This document describes with-sound version 1.2.1


=head1 SYNOPSIS

    $ with-sound [command] ([argument(s)])

    # e.g.
    #    $ with-sound prove t/


=head1 DESCRIPTION

with-sound is the command executor with sound (now with-sound can play the MP3 file only).

If exit-status of the command is success, it playbacks the sound of success.
Else, it plays sound of failure. And this application also can play the sound during executing the command.


=head1 CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT

App::WithSound requires a resource file as '.with-soundrc' on your home directory.
This resource file specifies the path to sound files. Like so:

    SUCCESS=~/Music/success.mp3
    FAILURE=~/Music/failure.mp3
    RUNNING=~/Music/running.mp3

If you want to play the different sound corresponded to discrete command, please use section notation as the following.

    [prove]
    SUCCESS=~/Music/success_prove.mp3
    FAILURE=~/Music/failure_prove.mp3
    RUNNING=~/Music/running_prove.mp3

In case of the above example, configured sounds will be played if you execute 'prove'.
And if other commands are executed, this application uses default settings.
("Default settings" means settings that is not specified by section)

You also can specify the paths by environment variables $ENV{'WITH_SOUND_SUCCESS'}, $ENV{'WITH_SOUND_FAILURE'}
and $ENV{'WITH_SOUND_RUNNING'}.

If the file paths are set by both environment variables and a configuration file,
the environment variables are prior to the configuration file.

These sound file settings are optional. You do not have to fill the all of settings.
with-sound will ignore playing sound if the sound file is not specified.

This module also requires "mpg123" or "mpg321" or "afplay" so please install it before use this application ("afplay" is pre-installed if you are using Mac OS X).
