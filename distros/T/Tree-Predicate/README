Tree::Predicate 0.03

NAME
	Tree::Predicate - a tree of predicate logic (e.g. an SQL predicate)

SYNOPSIS
	use Tree::Predicate qw(:logical);
	
	my $left_branch = OR('a', 'b');
	my $right_branch = OR('c', 'd');
	
	my $tree = AND($left_branch, $right_branch);
	
	my $sql = $tree->as_string;
	
	my @subtrees = $tree->split;
	for (@subtrees) {
		print $_->as_string;
	}

DESCRIPTION
	Improving static queries for optimal performance is almost as old
	as SQL itself.  A relatively recent discussion (on which this module
	is based) can be found in the book "High Performance MySQL" from
	O'Reilly.  One technique for improving queries relies on the way
	that MySQL chooses which indexes to use.  Prior to MySQL 5.0, a query
	such as:
	
	SELECT * FROM foo WHERE a = 1 OR b = 2
	
	would result in a full-table scan, regardless of whether foo is indexed
	on a or b.  For MySQL 5.0 or later, a combination index would be used
	for that query.
	
	But for this query:
	
	SELECT * FROM foo WHERE c IN ('foo', 'bar') AND (a = 1 OR b = 2)
	
	both before-5.0 and after-5.0 will use an index on c before considering
	a merged index of a/b.  For such queries, a significant improvement
	is available by rewriting the query as:
	
	SELECT * FROM foo WHERE c IN ('foo', 'bar') AND a = 1
	UNION
	SELECT * FROM foo WHERE c IN ('foo', 'bar') AND b = 2
	
	Even if we are using placeholders, it is straight-forward to rewrite
	any static query in whatever form performs best.  What about queries
	that are created dynamically, though?

	This is where Tree::Predicate comes in.  Construct a tree with its
	logical operators (AND/OR/NOT).  The "split" method will return a
	list of subtrees that can be used as predicates in a series of
	UNION queries that are logically equivalent to the original predicate.
	
	The subtrees can be used to construct a complete query or can be used
	to query a database successively so that previous results can be used to
	modify subsequent queries.  Suppose we have a tree $tree that is
	being used to query table items:
	
		my @ids;
		for my $subtree ($tree->split) {
			if (@ids) {
				my $ids = join ',' => @ids;
				my $phrase = "NOT IN ($ids)";
				my $new_subtree = AND($phrase, $subtree);
				my $sql =
					"SELECT id FROM items WHERE " . $new_subtree->as_string;
				my $aryref = $dbh->selectcol_arrayref($sql);
				push @ids, @$aryref;
			} else {
				my $sql =
					"SELECT id FROM items WHERE " . $subtree->as_string;
				my $aryref = $dbh->selectcol_arrayref($sql);
				@ids = @$aryref;
			}
		}
	
	This is just an example, of course.  Actual implementations will
	probably be more sophisticated.
	
CAVEATS
	Particularly with slower predicate atoms, such as REGEXP and LIKE, it is
	possible to turn a slow query into a VERY slow query by splitting its
	predicate into several.  You will probably want a heuristic that governs
	when you try to improve the dynamically-generate query or whether you
	just give the whole mess to the database to sort out.
	
FUTURE DIRECTIONS
	I have several ideas for future directions for this module.
	
	One is to allow associating anticipated selectivity and cost information
	with an atom so that the module can order subtrees accordingly.
	(Obviously, we should choose to execute predicates that can find as much
	of the total result as cheaply as possible.)
	
	Two related ideas would entail giving the tree a database handler, plus
	other information, so that it can compute its own result.  This would
	allow the short-circuit emulation above to become internal to the module.
	Additionally, tables that are joined for the purpose of evaluating one
	part of the predicate could be joined when that predicate is part of
	the subtree being evaluated.  Some parts of a predicate could be
	stored elsewhere, such as in a cache, which could avoid some database
	activity.
