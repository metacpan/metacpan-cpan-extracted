NAME
    Config::Role - Moose config attribute loaded from file in home dir

VERSION
    version 0.1.1

SYNOPSIS
        package My::Class;
        use Moose;
        with 'Config::Role';

        # Read configuration from ~/.my_class.ini, available in $self->config
        # This is optional if you like this particular naming of the file
        has 'config_filename' => ( is => 'ro', isa => 'Str', lazy_build => 1 );
        sub _build_config_filename { '.my_class.ini' }

        # Fetch a value from the configuration, allow constructor override
        has 'username' => ( is => 'ro', isa => 'Str', lazy_build => 1 );
        sub _build_username { return (shift)->config->{'username'}; }

        sub make_request {
            my ($self) = @_;
            my $response = My::Class::Request->make(
                username => $self->username,
                ...
            );
            ...
        }

RATIONALE
    This is the problem Config::Role was created to solve: Give me a config
    attribute (hashref) which is read from a file in my home directory to
    give other attributes default values, with configurability to choose the
    file's location and name.

DESCRIPTION
    Config::Role is a very basic role you can add to your Moose class that
    allows it to take configuration data from a file located in your home
    directory instead of always requiring parameters to be specified in the
    constructor.

    The synopsis shows how you can read the value of "username" from the
    file ".my_class.ini" located in the home directory of the current user.
    The location of the file is determined by whatever
    "File::HomeDir->my_data" returns for your particular platform.

    The config file is loaded by using Config::Any's "load_files()" method.
    It will load the files specified in the "config_files" attribute. By
    default this is an array reference that contains the filename from the
    "config_file" attribute. If you specify multiple files which both
    contain the same configuration key, the value is loaded from the first
    file. That is, the most significant file should be first in the array.

    The "Config::Any->load_files()" flag "use_ext" is set to a true value,
    so you can use any configuration file format supported by Config::Any by
    just specifying the common filename extension for the format.

ATTRIBUTES
  config_dir
    The directory where the configuration file is located. A
    Path::Class::Dir object. Defaults to "File::HomeDir->my_data". Allows
    coercion from Str.

  config_file
    The filename the configuration is read from. A Path::Class::File object.
    Allows coercion from Str. Default is calculated based on the composing
    class name. If your composing class is called "My::Class" it will be
    ".my_class.ini". Remember that if you sub-class the composing class, the
    default will be the name of the sub-class, not the super-class.

  config_files
    The collection of filenames the configuration is read from. Array
    reference of Path::Class::File objects. Allows coercion from an array
    reference of strings.

  config
    A hash reference that holds the compiled configuration read from the
    specified files.

METHODS
  config_filename
    Optional attribute or method on the composing class. Should return a
    string with the name of the configuration file name. See "config_file"
    for how the default is calculated if this method is not available.

COMPARISON TO MooseX::ConfigFromFile
    Config::Role doesn't require you to use anything else than
    "$class->new()" to actually get the benefit of automatic config loading.
    Someone might see this as negative, as it gives a minor performance
    penalty even if the config file is not present.

    Config::Role uses File::HomeDir to default to a known location, so you
    only need to specify the file name you use, not a full path. This should
    give better cross-platform compatibility, together with the use of
    Path::Class for all file system manipulation.

    Also, with Config::Role you must explicitly specify in the builder of an
    attribute that you want to use values from the config file.
    MooseX::ConfigFromFile seems to do that for you. You also get the
    benefit that the configuration file keys and the class attribute names
    does not need to map 1-to-1 (someone will probably see that as a bad
    thing).

    Otherwise they are pretty similar in terms of what they do.

TODO
    *   A nicely named sugar function could be exported to allow less
        boilerplate in generating attributes that default to config values.
