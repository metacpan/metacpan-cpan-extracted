=======

0.00007 15 Dec 2009
  * Enable "auto" by default. To surpress, set auto: 1 in your config

0.00006 04 Aug 2009
  * localize() can now be passed arguments in the form of
        $loc->localize( $key, \@args )
    This allows TT to pass in a arrayref as the argument to the localize method.

  * This is done in the Plugin level, as I don't see how else you would
    encounter a situation where you cannot convert an array ref to an array.

0.00005 07 May 2009
  * Make use of Class::C3::Adopt::NEXT

0.00004 14 Apr 2009
  * Add languages config parameter

0.00003 04 Mar 2009
  * Doc fix. Catalyst::Plugin::Data::Localize /is/ now compatible with
    Catalyst::Plugin::I18N (AFAIK), and so does not require any
    special handling for Catalyst::Controller::HTML::FormFu, which it
    previously stated.

0.00002 04 Mar 2009
  * Add language(), loc() for compatibility
  * Remove debug statement

0.00001 20 Feb 2009
  * Protect initialization code when/if the model gets called during
    setup time.

0.00001_01 20 Feb 2009
