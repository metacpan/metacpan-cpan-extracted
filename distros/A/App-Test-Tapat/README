App-Test-Tapat

This is the README file for App-Test-Tapat. Tapat is an automated testing 
framework which uses the TAP protocol. (More on the TAP protocol at 
http://testanything.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page.) This document is the
starting point for all things Tapat.

There also is a web site: http://tapat.sourceforge.net which has more information.
Please note that site is somewhat limited at the moment.


INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install

Or, alternatively, you can use the deb I have built. I recommend this method of 
installation, at least if you are using debian or one of its derivatives. I maintain
the package myself and try to keep it up to date along with the upstream software.
Currently it is only to be found in my debian repository, and I am not sure when I 
will submit it to debian. To use my repository, copy into your /etc/apt/sources.list
the following lines:

# Jeremiah Foster's deb repository:
deb http://jeremiahfoster.com:8080/apt sid main contrib non-free
deb-src http://jeremiahfoster.com:8080/apt sid main contrib non-free 

Now you can do an `aptitude update` and then `aptitude install libapp-test-tapat-perl 
and you should get the Tapat software along with its dependencies.

SUPPORT AND DOCUMENTATION

After installing, you can find documentation for this module with the
perldoc command.
