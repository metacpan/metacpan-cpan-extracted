0.34  (06/26/2014)
    (ms) Added disable_rrdtool_tag option as suggested by Sun Guonian.

0.33  (07/08/2013)
    (ms) Florian Eckert reported that graph() modified 2nd level
         entries of the options array passed to it. Used Storable::clone
         in OO.pm to make a deep copy first.

0.32  (03/06/2012)
    (ms) [rt.cpan.org #63351] Applied modified patch by Jonas Wagner to
         fix stacked graphs with no legend.

    (ms) Slaven Rezic reported huge memory consumption by the test suite,
         turned out to be fetch_start() call spanning several years. 
         Fixed by defining the end time as well as the start time.

0.26 (09/27/2009)
    (ms) [RT 32601] Using prompt() instead of manually asking for input

0.21 (01/23/2008)

    (ms) Bas van der Veen reported that the rrdtool download link 
         changed to http://oss.oetiker.ch/rrdtool/pub/rrdtool.tar.gz,

0.15 (07/23/2006)
    (ms) Fixed bug with multiple comment lines, of which only the first
         one was printed in the graph. It was introduced in 0.14. 
         Thanks to Steve van der Burg for reporting and a patch.

0.14 (04/28/2006)

    (ms) Makefile.PL dependencies version number changed from undef to 0
    (ms) Added 'rigid' option to graph.

0.11 (01/05/2005)
    (ms) Added suggestion by Richard Lippmann <lippmann@sprachtheorie.de>
         to allow for invisible graphs, just used as base for later 
         'cdef' calculations. Since leaving 'type' out will have
         RRDTool::OO default to 'line', type => 'hidden' is used to
         indicate the graph shouldn't be drawn. 
    (ms) Added gprint/print options for graphs

0.10 (11/20/2004)
    (ms) Added legends to graph()

    (ms) Added documentation for multiple data sources and archives.
    (ms) Martin Kurahaupo <martin@kurahaupo.gen.nz> added a patch
         to prevent the test suite from failing when run as root
         because a test file can't be write-protected.
    (ms) Chris Fedde <cfedde@denver.pm.org> provided a patch to 
         structure ::info's output more perl-like. Got input from
         perlmonks (thanks nobull!) on how to efficiently transform
         RRDTools info output into Perl data structures.

0.07 (08/15/2004)

         multiple 'color' settings in graph. Added new graph/color
         syntax.

0.05 (05/26/2004)
    (ms) added support for dump() and restore(). Test cases in
         t/007Dump.t will wait until these functions are 
         available in rrdtool, and are skipped until then.
    (ms) Some graph options don't have parameters, they can
         specified via option_name => undef now.
    (ms) Added lower_limit graph option
    (ms) Added eg/graph.pl as a graph example

         dump()/restore() added also, but not activated yet, 
         because not available via RRDs.

    (ms) fixed discovery of CFs
    (ms) fixed update with values/hash and added test case

0.02 05/16/2004
    (ms) used rrdtool info for meta queries

0.01 05/12/2004
    (ms) Where it all began.
