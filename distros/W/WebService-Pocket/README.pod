=head1 DESCRIPTION

This distribution provides an easy interface to the
L<Pocket API|http://getpocket.com/api/>.  It allows you to add, view and modify
your list of items in a very simple way.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new

The constructor accepts a C<username> and C<password> and validates
your credentials with the L<Pocket API|http://getpocket.com/api/>:

    my $p = WebService::Pocket->new(
        username => 'throughnothing',
        password => 'myS3cr3t',
    );

=head2 add

Allows you to add items to your C<Pocket> list.  You can add a single item
via a simple HashRef:

    my ( $new_item ) = $p->add( { url => 'http://youtube.com/video' } );

Or multiple items via an ArrayRef:

    my $new_items = $p->add([
        { url => 'http://youtube.com/video', title => 'video 1' },
        { url => 'http://youtube.com/video2', title => 'video 2' },
    ]);

Note that only the C<url> field is required for each added item, but you
can set the C<title> as well if you like. The C<add> function will always
return an ArrayRef of L<WebService::Pocket::Item> objects if it succeeded.

=head2 list

Allows you to retrieve the list of items in your C<Pocket> account.  Returns
a list of L<WebService::Pocket::Item> objects.

    my $items = $p->list;

You can pass in any parameters available to the
L<Pocket API Get|http://getpocket.com/api/docs/#get> request.

    # Get only read items, with tags
    $p->list( state = 0, tags => 1 );

    # Get only the first 5 resutls
    $p->list( count => 5, page => 1 );

=head2 stats

Stats will return a L<WebService::Pocket::Stats> object, which contains
a few statistics about your C<Pocket> account.

    # Get the stats object
    my $stats = $p->stats;

    # How long i've been a user
    say $stats->user_since;

    # How many items in my list total
    say $stats->count_list;

    # How many unread items in my list
    say $stats->count_unread;

    # How many read items in my list
    say $stats->count_read;
