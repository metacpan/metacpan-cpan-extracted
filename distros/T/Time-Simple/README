Time-Simple version 0.055
=========================

NAME
    Time::Simple - A simple, light-weight ISO 8601 time object.

SYNOPSIS
            use Time::Simple;
            my $time   = Time::Simple->new('23:24:59');
            my $hour   = $time->hours;
            my $minute = $time->minutes;
            my $second = $time->seconds;

            my $time2  = Time::Simple->new($hour, $minute, $second);

            my $now = Time::Simple->new;
            my $nexthour = $now + (60*60);
            print "An hour from now is $nexthour.\n";

            if ($nexthour->hour > 23) {
                    print "It'll be tomorrow within the next hour!\n";
            }

            # You can also do this:
            ($time cmp "23:24:25")
            # ...and this:
            ($time <=> [23, 24, 25])

            $time++; # Add a second
            $time--; # Subtract a second

            # Seconds of difference:
            $seconds = Time::Simple->new("00:00:02")
                     - Time::Simple->new("00:00:01");

            my $now  = Time::Simple->new;
            # A minute from now:
            my $then = Time::Simple->new( $now + 60 );
            # Or:
            my $soon = Time::Simple->new( '00:01:00' );

DESCRIPTION
    A simple, light-weight time object.

    This version should be considered an alpha developer release.

    How do you think this moudle should handle return values of
    multiplacation, where the return value would be greater than 23:59:59?

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

FATAL ERRORS
    Attempting to create an invalid time with this module will return
    "undef" rather than an object.

    Some operations can produce fatal errors: these can be replaced by
    warnings and the return of "undef" by switching the value of $FATALS:

            $Time::Simple::FATALS = undef;

    You will then only get warnings to "STDERR", and even then only if you
    asked perl for warnings with "use warnings" or by setting $^W either
    directly or with the "-w" command-line switch.

  EXPORT
    None by default.

  CONSTRUCTOR (new)
        $_ = Time::Simple->new('21:10:09');
        $_ = Time::Simple->new( 11,10, 9 );
        Time::Simple->new() == Time::Simple->new( time() );

    The constructor "new" returns a "Time::Simple" object if the supplied
    values specify a valid time, otherwise returns "undef".

    Valid times are either as supplied by the time, or in ISO 8601 format.
    In the latter case, the values may be supplied as a colon-delimited
    scalar, as a list, or as an anonymous array.

    If nothing is supplied to the constructor, the current local time will
    be used.

INSTANCE METHODS
  METHOD next
        my $will_be_by_one_second = $now->next;

    Returns the next time by incrementing the caller's time by one second.

  METHOD prev
        my $was_by_one_second = $now->prev;

    Returns the last time by decrementing the caller's time by one second.

  METHOD hour
        my $hr = $time->hour;

    The hour. Alias: "hours".

  METHOD minute
        my $min = $time->minute;

    The minutes. Alias: "minutes".

  METHOD second
        my $sec = $time->second;

    The seconds. Alias: "seconds".

  format
    Returns a string representing the time, in the format specified. If you
    don't pass a parameter, an ISO 8601 formatted time is returned.

        $date->format;
        $date->format("%H hours, %M minutes, and %S seconds");
        $date->format("%H-%M-%S");

    The formatting parameter is as you would pass to strftime(3): "strftime"
    in POSIX.

OPERATORS
    Some operators can be used with "Time::Simple" objects:

    += -=
        You can increment or decrement a time by a number of seconds using
        the "+=" and "-=" operators

    + - You can construct new times offset by a number of seconds using the
        "+" and "-" operators.

    -   You can subtract two times ("$t1 - $t2") to find the number of
        seconds between them.

    comparison
        You can compare two times using the arithmetic and/or string
        comparison operators: "lt le ge gt < <= >= >".

    ""  You can interpolate a time instance directly into a string, in the
        format specified by ISO 8601 (eg: 23:24:25).

    *   You can multiply a time by a number: "00:00:30 * 2 = 00:01:00".

    /   You can divide a time by a number: "00:02:00 * 2 = 00:01:00".

  DIAGNOSTICS
    "Illegal octal digit ...."
    You probably used an anonymous array and prefixed a number with a
    leading zero, as you would if you supplied a scalar string:
    "[11,10,09]".

TODO
    Suggestions welcome. How should operators not mentioend behave? Can one
    "verbar" times?
