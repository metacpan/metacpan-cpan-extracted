Proc::Safetynet version 0.01
============================

Proc::Safetynet is a utility framework for building programs that
supervises or "babysits" other processes. Supervision tasks can include
process management (start / stop) and program provisioning (add / remove
applications).

Proc::Safetynet is especially useful for monitoring and auto-restarting 
long-running server programs (e.g. FastCGI scripts).

Proc::Safetynet heavily borrows concepts and implementation details
from the Supervisord project - http://supervisord.org
