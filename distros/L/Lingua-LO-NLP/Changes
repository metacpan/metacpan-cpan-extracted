v1.0.0
	* BUGFIX: LAO VOWEL SIGN AM was "normalized" to the wrong character
		order when used after a tone mark.
	* BUGFIX: completely reworked the seriously broken tone rules.
		Despite each Lao material using its own, slightly different
		scheme, this should come close to reality now. This entails a
		set of tones that is slightly different from v0.2.0
	* IMPROVEMENT: Lingua::LO::NLP now accepts constructor options (one,
	  actually) to use as defaults for other methods.

v0.2.0
	* BUGFIX: add missing diphthongs ເ◌ີຍ and ເ◌ິຍ
	* BUGFIX: Lingua::LO::NLP::Romanize::hyphen did not allow
		to turn off hyphenation with an undef value as that
		makes it act as a read accessor. Now you can
		pass an explicit 0.
	* IMPROVEMENT: split ວ => ʋ/w depending on position in IPA
	* IMPROVEMENT: small documentation enhancements

v0.1.1	2016-12-04
