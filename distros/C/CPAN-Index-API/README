DESRIPTION
    "CPAN::Index::API" is a library to read and write CPAN index files. See
    the modules in the "CPAN::Index::API::File" namesace for documentation
    on the individual files supported.

    This class provides a convenient interface for working with multiple
    files from the same location at the same time.

  new
    Creates a new index object. Accepts the following parameters:

    files
        Required. Hashrefs whose values are "CPAN::Index::API::File"
        objects. The individual objects can later be accessed by their
        respective hash key via the "file" method.

    repo_path
        Optional. Path to the root of the repository to which the index
        files belong.

    repo_uri
        Optional. Base uri of the repository to which the index files
        belong.

  new_from_repo_path
    Creates a new index object by reading one or more index files from a
    local repository. Accepts the following parameters:

    files
        Required. Arrayref of names of index files to be read. Each name
        must be the name of a plugin under the "CPAN::Index::API::File::"
        namespace, e.g. "PackagesDetails", "ModList", etc.

    repo_path
        Required. Path to the root of the local repository.

  new_from_repo_uri
    Creates a new index object by reading one or more index files from a
    remote repository. Accepts the following parameters:

    files
        Required. Arrayref of names of index files to be read. Each name
        must be the name of a plugin under the "CPAN::Index::API::File::"
        namespace, e.g. "PackagesDetails", "ModList", etc.

    repo_uri
        Required. Path to the base uri of the remote repository.

METHODS
  file
    Given the name of a file plugin loaded within the index, returns the
    object corresponding to this index file.

  repo_path
    Returns the path to the repository.

  repo_uri
    Returns the base uri of the repository.

  write_all_files
