            if ($msg) {
                if ( $msg->err ) {
                    say "Error: ", Kafka::Librd::Error::to_string($err);
                }
                else {
                    say $msg->payload;
                }
            }
        }

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides perl bindings for librdkafka.

METHODS
  new
        $kafka = $class->new($type, \%config)

    Create a new instance. $type can be either "RD_KAFKA_CONSUMER" or
    "RD_KAFKA_PRODUCER". Config is a hash with configuration parameters as
    described in
    <https://github.com/edenhill/librdkafka/blob/master/CONFIGURATION.md>,
    additionally it may include "default_topic_config" key, with a hash
    containing default topic configuration properties.

  brokers_add
        $cnt = $kafka->brokers_add($brokers)

    add one or more brokers to the list of initial bootstrap brokers.
    *$brokers* is a comma separated list of brokers in the format
    "[proto://]host[:port]".

  subscribe
        $err = $kafka->subscribe(\@topics)

    subscribe to the list of topics using balanced consumer groups.

  unsubscribe
        $err = $kafka->unsubscribe

    unsubscribe from the current subsctiption set

  subscription
        $tplist = $kafka->subscription

    return current subscription. Subscription returned as a reference to
    array of hashes with the following fields: "topic", "partition",
    "offset", "metadata".

  assign
        $err = $kafka->assign(\@tplist)

    assign partitions to consume. @tplist is an array of hashes with "topic"
    and "partition" fields set.

  assignment
        $tplist = $kafka->assignment

    return current assignment. Result returned in the same way as for
    "subscription".

  consumer_poll
        $msg = $kafka->consumer_poll($timeout_ms)

    poll for messages or events. If any message or event received, returns
    "Kafka::Librd::Message" object. If "<$msg-"err>> for returned object is
    zero (RD_KAFKA_RESP_ERR_NO_ERROR), then it is a proper message,
    otherwise it is an event or an error.

  commit
        $err = $kafka->commit(\@tplist, $async)

    commit offsets to the broker. @tplist is an array of hashes with the
    following keys: "topic", "partition", "offset", "metadata". If
    @topic_partition_list is missing or undef, then current partition
    assignment is used instead. If $async is 1, then method returns
    immediately, if it is 0 or missing then method blocks until offsets are
    commited.

  commit_message
        $err = $kafka->commit_message($msg, $async)

    commit message's offset for the message's partition. $async same as for
    "commit".

  committed
        $tplist = $kafka->committed(\@tplist, $timeout_ms)

    retrieve commited offsets for topics and partitions specified in
    @tplist, which is an array of hashes with "topic" and "partition"
    fields. Returned $tplist contains a copy of the input list with added
    "offset" fields.

  position
        $tplist = $kafka->position(\@tplist)

    retrieve current offsets for topics and partitions specified in @tplist,
    which is an array of hashes with "topic" and "partition" fields.
    Returned $tplist contains a copy of the input list with added "offset"
    fields.

  consumer_close
        $err = $kafka->consumer_close

    close down the consumer

  topic
        $topic = $kafka->topic($name, \%config)

    return a "Kafka::Librd::Topic"topic object, that can be used to produce
    messages

  outq_len
        $len = $kafka->outq_len

    return the current out queue length.

  destroy
        $kafka->destroy

    destroy kafka handle

  dump
        $kafka->dump

    dump internal state of kafka handle to stdout, only useful for debugging

Kafka::Librd::Topic
    This class maps to "rd_kafka_topic_t" structure from librdkafka and
    represents topic. It should be created with "topic" method of
    Kafka::Librd object. It provides the following method:

  produce
        $err = $topic->produce($partition, $msgflags, $payload, $key)

    produce a message for the topic. *$msgflags* can be RD_KAFKA_MSG_F_BLOCK
    in the future, but currently it should be set to 0, RD_KAFKA_MSG_F_COPY
    and RD_KAFKA_MSG_F_FREE must not be used, internally RD_KAFKA_MSG_F_COPY
    is always set.

Kafka::Librd::Message
    This class maps to "rd_kafka_message_t" structure from librdkafka and
    represents message or event. Objects of this class have the following
    methods:

  err
    return error code from the message

  topic
    return topic name

  partition
    return partition number

  offset
    return offset. Note, that the value is truncated to 32 bit if your perl
    doesn't support 64 bit integers.

  key
    return message key

  payload
    return message payload

CAVEATS
    Message offset is truncated to 32 bit if perl compiled without support
    for 64 bit integers.
