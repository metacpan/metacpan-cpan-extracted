NAME
    Dancer2::Plugin::Auth::Extensible::Provider::DBIC - authenticate via the
    Dancer2::Plugin::DBIC plugin

DESCRIPTION
    This class is an authentication provider designed to authenticate users
    against a database, using Dancer2::Plugin::DBIC to access a database.

    See Dancer2::Plugin::DBIC for how to configure a database connection
    appropriately; see the "CONFIGURATION" section below for how to
    configure this authentication provider with database details.

    See Dancer2::Plugin::Auth::Extensible for details on how to use the
    authentication framework.

CONFIGURATION
    This provider tries to use sensible defaults, in the same manner as
    Dancer2::Plugin::Auth::Extensible::Provider::Database, so you may not
    need to provide much configuration if your database tables look similar
    to those.

    The most basic configuration, assuming defaults for all options, and
    defining a single authentication realm named 'users':

        plugins:
            Auth::Extensible:
                realms:
                    users:
                        provider: 'DBIC'

    You would still need to have provided suitable database connection
    details to Dancer2::Plugin::DBIC, of course; see the docs for that
    plugin for full details, but it could be as simple as, e.g.:

        plugins:
            Auth::Extensible:
                realms:
                    users:
                        provider: 'DBIC'
                        users_resultset: 'User'
                        roles_resultset: Role
                        user_roles_resultset: UserRole
            DBIC:
                default:
                    dsn: dbi:mysql:database=mydb;host=localhost
                    schema_class: MyApp::Schema
                    user: user
                    pass: secret

    A full example showing all options:

        plugins:
            Auth::Extensible:
                realms:
                    users:
                        provider: 'DBIC'

                        # Should get_user_details return an inflated DBIC row
                        # object? Defaults to false which will return a hashref
                        # inflated using DBIx::Class::ResultClass::HashRefInflator
                        # instead. This also affects what `logged_in_user` returns.
                        user_as_object: 1

                        # generate the resultset names.  If you use standard DBIC
                        # resultset names, then these and the column names are the
                        # only settings you might need.  The relationships between
                        # these resultsets is automatically introspected by

                        # by DBIC, and are passed directly to the DBIC resultset search
                        user_valid_conditions:
                            deleted: 0
                            account_request:
                                "<": 1

                        # Optionally specify a key for the user's roles to be returned in.
                        # Roles will be returned as role_name => 1 hashref pairs

                        # If you don't use standard DBIC resultset names, you might
                        # need to configure these instead:
                        users_resultset: User
                        roles_resultset: Role
                        user_roles_resultset: UserRole

                        # Optional: To validate passwords using a method called
                        # 'check_password' in users_resultset result class
                        # which takes the password to check as a single argument:
                        users_password_check: check_password

                        # Deprecated settings. The following settings were renamed for clarity
                        # to the *_source settings
                        users_table:
                        roles_table:
                        user_roles_table:

    user_as_object
        Defaults to false.

        By default a row object is returned as a simple hash reference using
        DBIx::Class::ResultClass::HashRefInflator. Setting this to true
        causes normal row objects to be returned instead.

    user_source
        Specifies the source name that contains the users. This will be
        camelized to generate the resultset name. The relationship to
        user_roles_source will be introspected from the schema.

    role_source
        Specifies the source name that contains the roles. This will be
        camelized to generate the resultset name. The relationship to
        user_roles_source will be introspected from the schema.

    user_roles_source
        Specifies the source name that contains the user_roles joining
        table. This will be camelized to generate the resultset name. The
        relationship to the user and role source will be introspected from
        the schema.

    users_username_column
        Specifies the column name of the username column in the users table

    users_password_column
        Specifies the column name of the password column in the users table

    roles_role_column
        Specifies the column name of the role name column in the roles table

    schema_name
        Specfies the name of the Dancer2::Plugin::DBIC schema to use. If not
        specified, will default in the same manner as the DBIC plugin.

    user_valid_conditions
        Specifies additional search parameters when looking up a user in the
        users table. For example, you might want to exclude any account this
        is flagged as deleted or disabled.

        The value of this parameter will be passed directly to DBIC as a
        search condition. It is therefore possible to nest parameters and
        use different operators for the condition. See the example config
        above for an example.

    roles_key
        Specifies a key for the returned user hash to also return the user's
        roles in. The value of this key will contain a hash ref, which will
        contain each permission with a value of 1. In your code you might
        then have:

            my $user = logged_in_user;
            return foo_bar($user);

            sub foo_bar
            {   my $user = shift;
                if ($user->{roles}->{beer_drinker}) {
                   ...
                }
            }

        This isn't intended to replace the "user_has_role" in
        Dancer2::Plugin::Auth::Extensible keyword. Instead it is intended to
        make it easier to access a user's roles if the user hash is being
        passed around (without requiring access to the user_has_role keyword
        in other modules).

    users_resultset
    roles_resultset
    user_roles_resultset
        These configuration values are provided for fine-grain tuning of
        your DBIC resultset names. If you use standard DBIC naming
        practices, you will not need to configure these, and they will be
        generated internally automatically.

SUGGESTED SCHEMA
    If you use a schema similar to the examples provided here, you should
    need minimal configuration to get this authentication provider to work
    for you. The examples given here should be MySQL-compatible; minimal
    changes should be required to use them with other database engines.

  user Table
    You'll need a table to store user accounts in, of course. A suggestion
    is something like:

         CREATE TABLE user (
             id int(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
                     username varchar(32) NOT NULL,
             password varchar(40) DEFAULT NULL,
             name varchar(128) DEFAULT NULL,
             email varchar(255) DEFAULT NULL,
             deleted tinyint(1) NOT NULL DEFAULT '0',
             lastlogin datetime DEFAULT NULL,
             pw_changed datetime DEFAULT NULL,
             pw_reset_code varchar(255) DEFAULT NULL,
             PRIMARY KEY (id)
         );

    All columns from the users table will be returned by the
    "logged_in_user" keyword for your convenience.

  role Table
    You'll need a table to store a list of available groups in.

             CREATE TABLE role (
             id int(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
             role varchar(32) NOT NULL,
             PRIMARY KEY (id)
         );

  user_role Table
    Also requred is a table mapping the users to the roles.

         CREATE TABLE user_role (
             user_id int(11) NOT NULL,
             role_id int(11) NOT NULL,
             PRIMARY KEY (user_id, role_id),
             FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES user(id),
             FOREIGN KEY (role_id) REFERENCES role(id)
         );
