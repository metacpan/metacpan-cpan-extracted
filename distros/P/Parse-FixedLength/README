Revamped Parse::FixedLength for parsing fixed length ascii data.
(Well, you could parse some binary fields, but you'd have to convert them
yourself after parsing them as ascii data, and so this module
becomes less useful the more you have to do that...)

TO INSTALL:
 perl Makefile.PL
 make
 make test
 make install

See the perldocs and the tests (in the t directory) for examples.
