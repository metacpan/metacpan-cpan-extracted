  - Add the --jobs option and try to detect if make doesn't support it
  - Correct an off-by-one error on the log's month
  - Be more clear when Makefile.PL or Build.PL couldn't be found and avoid

0.26  2018-11-09 00:36:48 EST
  - Use the full form of File::Temp->new for older perls. GH#11
  - Consolidate use of CoreList so we can also check if a module is deprecated
    and act like it's not core if it is deprecated. GH#12
  - Bug fix for the tests that attempted to install Test::More when core perl
    had the same version as cpan. Fixes perl rt #133617

0.25  2018-10-17 22:45:47 EDT

  - Improve restart_script to work better without --directory (GH#8)
  - Copy App::MechaCPAN to the new locations if it doesn't already exist
    in the destination directory (GH#8)
  - Thanks to James Pattie/pattieja1 for the changes and testing with CH#8
  - Logs now have a much more humane name that includes a timestamp
  - The amount of random, temporary files, both during processing as well as
    after exceptions, has been reduced

0.22  2018-03-02 10:02:08 EST
  - Hotfix a bug with the minimum git test so it uses a known version (the
    minimum we support) instead of the version the machine happens to have

0.21  2018-03-02 00:37:55 EST
  - Having two distributions list the same module in provides is no longer
    immediately fatal.
  - Add the smart-tests option to installing perl
  - Make the code surrounding git more robust and refuse to use use any
    version of git < 1.7.7. (GH#6)
  - Fix --skip-lib and --skip-local so they now actually turn a feature off

0.20  2017-07-21 22:28:41 EDT

  - Reduce the number of calls to metacpan for finding modules
  - Improve the error handling and reporting
  - Handle more variations of CPAN modules
  - Don't stop processing modules after the first error
  - Accept git repositories as a parameter to deploy to checkout and deploy
    from

  - Delete PERL_USE_UNSAFE_INC before running other module's tests (GH#5)
  - Increase the default timeout to 60s
  - Add a --devel flag so you can install unstable versions of perl
  - Fix a bug that would try to install a module after it was determined that
    it didn't need to be installed again

0.18  2017-04-10 16:20:23 EDT
  - Goofed up and did 'keys $req', which is not really okay

0.17  2017-04-10 01:18:00 EDT
  - Make --verbose and --quiet work
  - Fix it so module load order doesn't prevent arguments
  - Make sure module versions are revisited after seeing them
  - Calculate the module name since it's not easily gotten
  - Manually add . to the require path for perl 5.26 (GH#4)

0.16  2017-03-09 23:48:57 EST

  - Include PERL_USE_UNSAFE_INC environment variable to handle the upcoming
    perl v5.26 change that will remove . from the default @INC. Fixes GitHub #3
  - Disable certificate checking in git while testing. It is less than ideal,
