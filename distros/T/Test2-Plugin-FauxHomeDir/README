NAME

    Test2::Plugin::FauxHomeDir - Setup a faux home directory for tests

VERSION

    version 0.05

SYNOPSIS

     use Test2::Plugin::FauxHomeDir;
     use Test2::V0;

DESCRIPTION

    This module sets up a faux home directory for tests. The home directory
    is empty, and will be removed when the test completes. This can be
    helpful when you are writing tests that may be reading from the real
    user configuration files, or if it writes output to the user home
    directory.

    At the moment this module accomplishes this by setting the operating
    system appropriate environment variables. In the future, it may hook
    into some of the other methods used for determining home directories
    (such as getpwuid and friends). There are many ways of getting around
    this faux module and getting the real home directory (especially from
    C). But if your code uses standard Perl interfaces then this plugin
    should fool your code okay.

    This module sets the native environment variables for the home
    directory on your platform. That means on Windows USERPROFILE,
    HOMEDRIVE and HOMEPATH will be set, but HOME will not. This is
    important because your testing environment should match as closely as
    possible what the actual environment will look like.

    You should load this module as early as possible.

    This systems are actively developed and tested:

    Linux

    Strawberry Perl (Windows)

    cygwin

    I expect that it should work on most other modern UNIX platforms. It
    probably will not work on more esoteric systems like VMS or msys2.
    Patches to address this will be eagerly accepted.

METHODS

 real_home_dir

    Returns the real home directory as detected during startup. If
    initialization hasn't happened then this will return undef.

CAVEATS

    Arguably your code shouldn't depend on or be affected by stuff in your
    home directory, or have a hook for your tests to alternate
    configuration files.

    Strange things may happen if you try to use both this plugin and
    File::HomeDir::Test. A notice or diagnostic (depending on if the test
    is passing) will be raised at the end of the test if you attempt this.

SEE ALSO

    File::HomeDir::Test

      I used to use this module a lot. It was good. Unfortunately It has
      not, in this developers opinion, been actively maintained for years,
      with the very brief exception when it was broken by changes
      introduced in the Perl 5.25.x series when . was removed from @INC.

      This module also comes bundled as part of File::HomeDir which does a
      lot more than I really need.

      This module also dies if it is used more than once which I think is
      unnecessary.

      This module also sets HOME on all platforms, even on ones where that
      is not the native environment variable for the home directory. This
      can be a problem, because if your code is using HOME, and your
      testing environment fakes it so that works, then your testing
      environment may be hiding bugs.
