=head1 NAME

PAGI::Server - PAGI Reference Server Implementation

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use IO::Async::Loop;
    use PAGI::Server;

    my $loop = IO::Async::Loop->new;

    my $server = PAGI::Server->new(
        app  => \&my_pagi_app,
        host => '127.0.0.1',
        port => 5000,
    );

    $loop->add($server);
    $server->listen->get;  # Start accepting connections

=head1 DESCRIPTION

PAGI::Server is a reference implementation of a PAGI-compliant HTTP server.
It supports HTTP/1.1, WebSocket, and Server-Sent Events (SSE) as defined
in the PAGI specification.

This is NOT a production server - it prioritizes spec compliance and code
clarity over performance optimization. It serves as the canonical reference
for how PAGI servers should behave.

=head1 PROTOCOL SUPPORT

B<Currently supported:>

=over 4

=item * HTTP/1.1 (full support including chunked encoding, trailers, keepalive)

=item * WebSocket (RFC 6455)

=item * Server-Sent Events (SSE)

=back

B<Not yet implemented:>

=over 4

=item * HTTP/2 - Planned for a future release

=item * HTTP/3 (QUIC) - Under consideration

=back

For HTTP/2 support today, run PAGI::Server behind a reverse proxy like nginx
or Caddy that handles HTTP/2 on the frontend and speaks HTTP/1.1 to PAGI.

=head1 WINDOWS SUPPORT

B<PAGI::Server does not support Windows.>

The server relies on Unix-specific features that are not available on Windows:

=over 4

=item * B<Unix signals> - SIGTERM, SIGINT, SIGHUP for graceful shutdown and worker management

=item * B<fork()> - Multi-worker mode requires real process forking, not thread emulation

=item * B<IO::Async internals> - The event loop has Unix-specific optimizations

=back

For Windows development, consider using WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) to
run PAGI::Server in a Linux environment. The PAGI specification and middleware
components can still be developed and unit-tested on Windows, but the reference
server implementation requires a Unix-like operating system.


=head1 CONSTRUCTOR

=head2 new

    my $server = PAGI::Server->new(%options);

Creates a new PAGI::Server instance. Options:

=over 4

=item app => \&coderef (required)

The PAGI application coderef with signature: async sub ($scope, $receive, $send)

=item host => $host

Bind address (IP address or hostname). Default: C<'127.0.0.1'>

The default binds only to the loopback interface, accepting connections only
from localhost. This is B<intentionally secure by default> - development
servers won't accidentally be exposed to the network.

B<Common values:>

    '127.0.0.1'      - Localhost only (default, secure for development)
    '0.0.0.0'        - All IPv4 interfaces (required for remote access)
    '::'             - All IPv6 interfaces (may also accept IPv4)
    '192.168.1.100'  - Specific interface only

B<For headless servers or production deployments> where remote clients need
to connect, bind to all interfaces:

    my $server = PAGI::Server->new(
        app  => $app,
        host => '0.0.0.0',
        port => 8080,
    );

B<Security note:> When binding to C<0.0.0.0>, ensure appropriate firewall
rules are in place. For production, consider a reverse proxy (nginx, etc.)

=item port => $port

Bind port. Default: 5000

=item ssl => \%config

Optional TLS/HTTPS configuration. B<Requires additional modules> - see
L</ENABLING TLS SUPPORT> below.

Configuration keys:

=over 4

=item cert_file => $path

Path to the SSL certificate file (PEM format).

=item key_file => $path

Path to the SSL private key file (PEM format).

=item ca_file => $path

Optional path to CA certificate for client verification.

=item verify_client => $bool

If true, require and verify client certificates.

=item min_version => $version

Minimum TLS version. Default: C<'TLSv1_2'>. Options: C<'TLSv1_2'>, C<'TLSv1_3'>.

=item cipher_list => $string

OpenSSL cipher list. Default uses modern secure ciphers.

=back

Example:

    my $server = PAGI::Server->new(
        app => $app,
        ssl => {
            cert_file => '/path/to/server.crt',
            key_file  => '/path/to/server.key',
        },
    );

=item disable_tls => $bool

Force-disable TLS even if ssl config is provided. Useful for testing
TLS configuration parsing without actually enabling TLS. Default: false.

=item extensions => \%extensions

Extensions to advertise (e.g., { fullflush => {} })

=item on_error => \&callback

Error callback receiving ($error)

=item access_log => $filehandle | undef

Access log filehandle. Default: STDERR

Set to C<undef> to disable access logging entirely. This eliminates
per-request I/O overhead, improving throughput by 5-15% depending on
workload. Useful for benchmarking or when access logs are handled
externally (e.g., by a reverse proxy).

    # Disable access logging
    my $server = PAGI::Server->new(
        app        => $app,
        access_log => undef,
    );

=item log_level => $level

Controls the verbosity of server log messages. Default: 'info'

Valid levels (from least to most verbose):

=over 4

=item * B<error> - Only errors (application errors, fatal conditions)

=item * B<warn> - Warnings and errors (connection issues, timeouts)

=item * B<info> - Informational messages and above (startup, shutdown, worker spawning)

=item * B<debug> - Everything (verbose diagnostics, frame-level details)

=back

    my $server = PAGI::Server->new(
        app       => $app,
        log_level => 'debug',  # Very verbose
    );

B<CLI:> C<--log-level debug>

=item workers => $count

Number of worker processes for multi-worker mode. Default: 0 (single process mode).

When set to a value greater than 0, the server uses a pre-fork model:

=item listener_backlog => $number

Value for the listener queue size. Default: 2048

When in multi worker mode, the queue size for those workers inherits
from this value.

=item reuseport => $bool

Enable SO_REUSEPORT mode for multi-worker servers. Default: 0 (disabled).

When enabled, each worker process creates its own listening socket with
SO_REUSEPORT, allowing the kernel to load-balance incoming connections
across workers. This can reduce accept() contention and improve p99
latency under high concurrency.

B<Traditional mode (reuseport=0):> Parent creates one socket before forking,
all workers inherit and share that socket. Workers compete on a single
accept queue (potential thundering herd).

B<Reuseport mode (reuseport=1):> Each worker creates its own socket with
SO_REUSEPORT. The kernel distributes connections across sockets, each
worker has its own accept queue (reduced contention).

B<Platform notes:>

=over 4

=item * B<Linux 3.9+>: Full kernel-level load balancing. Recommended for high
concurrency workloads.

=item * B<macOS/BSD>: SO_REUSEPORT allows multiple binds but does NOT provide
kernel load balancing. May actually decrease performance compared to shared
socket mode. Use with caution - benchmark before deploying.

=back

=item max_receive_queue => $count

Maximum number of messages that can be queued in the WebSocket receive queue
before the connection is closed. This is a DoS protection mechanism.

B<Unit:> Message count (not bytes). Each WebSocket text or binary frame counts
as one message regardless of size.

B<Default:> 1000 messages

B<When exceeded:> The server sends a WebSocket close frame with code 1008
(Policy Violation) and reason "Message queue overflow", then closes the
connection.

B<Tuning guidelines:>

=over 4

=item * B<Memory impact:> Each queued message holds the full message payload.
With default of 1000 messages and average 1KB messages, worst case is ~1MB
per slow connection.

=item * B<Workers:> Total memory risk = workers × max_connections × max_receive_queue × avg_message_size.
For 4 workers, 100 connections each, 1000 queue, 1KB average = 400MB worst case.

=item * B<Fast consumers:> If your app processes messages quickly, the queue
rarely grows. Default of 1000 is generous for most applications.

=item * B<Slow consumers:> If your app does expensive processing per message,
consider lowering to 100-500 to limit memory exposure.

=item * B<High throughput:> If you have trusted clients sending rapid bursts,
you may increase to 5000-10000, but monitor memory usage.

=back

B<CLI:> C<--max-receive-queue 500>

=item max_ws_frame_size => $bytes

Maximum size in bytes for a single WebSocket frame payload. When a client
sends a frame larger than this limit, the connection is closed with a
protocol error.

B<Unit:> Bytes

B<Default:> 65536 (64KB) - matches Protocol::WebSocket default

B<When exceeded:> The server closes the connection. The error is logged as
"PAGI connection error: Payload is too big."

B<Tuning guidelines:>

=over 4

=item * B<Small messages:> For chat apps or control messages, default 64KB is plenty.

=item * B<File uploads:> For binary data transfer via WebSocket, increase to 1MB-16MB
depending on expected file sizes.

=item * B<Memory impact:> Each connection can buffer up to max_ws_frame_size bytes
during frame parsing. High values increase memory per connection.

=item * B<DoS protection:> Lower values limit memory exhaustion from malicious clients
sending oversized frames.

=back

B<CLI:> C<--max-ws-frame-size 1048576>

=item max_connections => $count

Maximum number of concurrent connections before returning HTTP 503.
Default: 0 (auto-detect from ulimit - 50).

When at capacity, new connections receive a 503 Service Unavailable
response with a Retry-After header. This prevents file descriptor
exhaustion crashes under heavy load.

The auto-detected limit uses: C<ulimit -n> minus 50 for headroom
(file operations, logging, database connections, etc.).

B<Example:>

    my $server = PAGI::Server->new(
        app             => $app,
        max_connections => 200,  # Explicit limit
    );

B<CLI:> C<--max-connections 200>

B<Monitoring:> Use C<< $server->connection_count >> and
C<< $server->effective_max_connections >> to monitor usage.

=item max_body_size => $bytes

Maximum request body size in bytes. Default: 10,000,000 (10MB).
Set to 0 for unlimited (not recommended for public-facing servers).

Requests with Content-Length exceeding this limit receive HTTP 413
(Payload Too Large). Chunked requests are also checked as data arrives.

B<Example:>

    my $server = PAGI::Server->new(
        app           => $app,
        max_body_size => 50_000_000,  # 50MB for file uploads
    );

    # Unlimited (use with caution)
    my $server = PAGI::Server->new(
        app           => $app,
        max_body_size => 0,
    );

B<CLI:> C<--max-body-size 50000000>

B<Security note:> Without a body size limit, attackers can exhaust server
memory with large requests. The 10MB default balances security with common
use cases (file uploads, JSON payloads). Increase for specific needs, or
use 0 only behind a reverse proxy that enforces its own limit.

=over 4

=item * A listening socket is created before forking

=item * Worker processes are spawned using C<< $loop->fork() >> which properly
handles IO::Async's C<$ONE_TRUE_LOOP> singleton

=item * Each worker gets a fresh event loop and runs lifespan startup independently

=item * Workers that exit are automatically respawned via C<< $loop->watch_process() >>

=item * SIGTERM/SIGINT triggers graceful shutdown of all workers

=back

=item sync_file_threshold => $bytes

Threshold in bytes for synchronous file reads. Files smaller than this value
are read synchronously in the event loop; larger files use async I/O via
a worker pool.

B<Default:> 65536 (64KB)

Set to 0 for fully async file reads. This is recommended for:

=over 4

=item * Network filesystems (NFS, SMB, cloud storage)

=item * High-latency storage (spinning disks under load)

=item * Docker volumes with overlay filesystem

=back

The default (64KB) is optimized for local SSDs where small synchronous reads
are faster than the overhead of async I/O.

B<CLI:> C<--sync-file-threshold NUM>

=item max_requests => $count

Maximum number of requests a worker process will handle before restarting.
After serving this many requests, the worker gracefully shuts down and the
parent spawns a replacement.

B<Default:> 0 (disabled - workers run indefinitely)

B<When to use:>

=over 4

=item * Long-running deployments where gradual memory growth is a concern

=item * Applications with known memory leaks that can't be easily fixed

=item * Defense against slow memory growth (~6.5 bytes/request observed in PAGI)

=back

B<Note:> Only applies in multi-worker mode (C<workers> > 0). In single-worker
mode, this setting is ignored.

B<CLI:> C<--max-requests 10000>

Example: With 4 workers and max_requests=10000, total capacity before any
restart is 40,000 requests. Workers restart individually without downtime.

=item request_timeout => $seconds

Maximum time in seconds a request can stall without any I/O activity before
being terminated. This is a "stall timeout" - the timer resets whenever data
is read from the client or written to the client.

B<Default:> 0 (disabled)

B<Why disabled by default:> Creating per-request timers adds overhead that
impacts throughput on high-performance workloads. For maximum performance,
this is disabled by default. Most production deployments run behind a reverse
proxy (nginx, haproxy) which provides its own timeout protection.

B<When to enable:>

=over 4

=item * Running PAGI directly without a reverse proxy

=item * Small/internal apps where simplicity matters more than max throughput

=item * Untrusted clients that might send data slowly or hang

=item * Defense against application bugs that cause requests to hang indefinitely

=back

B<How it works:>

=over 4

=item * Timer starts when request processing begins

=item * Timer resets on any read activity (receiving request body)

=item * Timer resets on any write activity (sending response)

=item * If timer expires (no I/O for N seconds), connection is closed

=item * Not used for WebSocket/SSE (they have C<ws_idle_timeout>/C<sse_idle_timeout>)

=back

B<Example:>

    # Enable 30 second stall timeout (recommended when not behind proxy)
    my $server = PAGI::Server->new(
        app             => $app,
        request_timeout => 30,
    );

B<CLI:> C<--request-timeout 30>

B<Note:> This differs from C<timeout> (idle connection timeout). The
C<timeout> applies between requests on keep-alive connections. The
C<request_timeout> applies during active request processing.

=item ws_idle_timeout => $seconds

Maximum time in seconds a WebSocket connection can be idle without any
activity (no messages sent or received) before being closed.

B<Default:> 0 (disabled - WebSocket connections can be idle indefinitely)

When enabled, the timer resets on:

=over 4

=item * Sending any WebSocket frame (accept, send, ping, close)

=item * Receiving any WebSocket frame from client

=back

B<Example:>

    # Close idle WebSocket connections after 5 minutes
    my $server = PAGI::Server->new(
        app             => $app,
        ws_idle_timeout => 300,
    );

B<CLI:> C<--ws-idle-timeout 300>

B<Note:> For more sophisticated keep-alive behavior with ping/pong, use
the C<PAGI::Middleware::WebSocket::Heartbeat> middleware instead.

=item sse_idle_timeout => $seconds

Maximum time in seconds an SSE connection can be idle without any events
being sent before being closed.

B<Default:> 0 (disabled - SSE connections can be idle indefinitely)

The timer resets each time an event is sent to the client (including
comments and the initial headers).

B<Example:>

    # Close idle SSE connections after 2 minutes
    my $server = PAGI::Server->new(
        app              => $app,
        sse_idle_timeout => 120,
    );

B<CLI:> C<--sse-idle-timeout 120>

B<Note:> For SSE connections that may be legitimately idle, consider
using the C<PAGI::Middleware::SSE::Heartbeat> middleware to send
periodic comment keepalives.

=back

=head1 METHODS

=head2 listen

    my $future = $server->listen;

Starts listening for connections. Returns a Future that completes when
the server is ready to accept connections.

=head2 shutdown

    my $future = $server->shutdown;

Initiates graceful shutdown. Returns a Future that completes when
shutdown is complete.

=head2 port

    my $port = $server->port;

Returns the bound port number. Useful when port => 0 is used.

=head2 is_running

    my $bool = $server->is_running;

Returns true if the server is accepting connections.

=head2 connection_count

    my $count = $server->connection_count;

Returns the current number of active connections.

=head2 effective_max_connections

    my $max = $server->effective_max_connections;

Returns the effective maximum connections limit. If C<max_connections>
was set explicitly, returns that value. Otherwise returns the
auto-detected limit (ulimit - 50).

=head1 FILE RESPONSE STREAMING

PAGI::Server supports efficient file streaming via the C<file> and C<fh>
keys in C<http.response.body> events:

    # Stream entire file
    await $send->({
        type => 'http.response.body',
        file => '/path/to/file.mp4',
        more => 0,
    });

    # Stream partial file (for Range requests)
    await $send->({
        type => 'http.response.body',
        file => '/path/to/file.mp4',
        offset => 1000,
        length => 5000,
        more => 0,
    });

    # Stream from filehandle
    open my $fh, '<:raw', $file;
    await $send->({
        type => 'http.response.body',
        fh => $fh,
        length => $size,
        more => 0,
    });
    close $fh;

The server streams files in 64KB chunks to avoid memory bloat. Small files
(under 64KB) are read synchronously for speed; larger files use async I/O
via a worker pool to avoid blocking the event loop.

=head2 Production Recommendations for Static Files

B<For production deployments, we strongly recommend delegating static file
serving to a reverse proxy:>

=over 4

=item 1. B<Use nginx, Apache, or a CDN>

Place a reverse proxy in front of PAGI::Server and let it handle static
files directly. This provides:

=over 4

=item * Optimized file serving with kernel sendfile

=item * Efficient caching and compression

=item * Protection from slow client attacks

=item * HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 support

=back

=item 2. B<Use L<PAGI::Middleware::XSendfile>>

For files that require authentication or authorization, use the XSendfile
middleware to delegate file serving to the reverse proxy:

    use PAGI::Middleware::Builder;

    my $app = builder {
        enable 'XSendfile',
            type    => 'X-Accel-Redirect',  # For Nginx
            mapping => { '/var/www/protected/' => '/internal/' };
        $my_app;
    };

See L<PAGI::Middleware::XSendfile> for details.

=back

=head1 ENABLING TLS SUPPORT

PAGI::Server supports HTTPS/TLS connections, but requires additional modules
that are not installed by default. This keeps the base installation minimal
for users who don't need TLS.

=head2 When You Need TLS

You need TLS if you want to:

=over 4

=item * Serve HTTPS traffic directly from PAGI::Server

=item * Test TLS locally during development

=item * Use client certificate authentication

=back

You B<don't> need TLS if you:

=over 4

=item * Use a reverse proxy (nginx, Apache) that handles TLS termination

=item * Only serve HTTP traffic on localhost for development

=item * Deploy behind a load balancer that provides TLS

=back

B<Production recommendation:> Use a reverse proxy (nginx, HAProxy, etc.) for
TLS termination. They offer better performance, easier certificate management,
and battle-tested security. PAGI::Server's TLS support is primarily for
development and testing.

=head2 Installing TLS Modules

To enable TLS support, install the required modules:

B<Using cpanm:>

    cpanm IO::Async::SSL IO::Socket::SSL

B<Using system packages (Debian/Ubuntu):>

    apt-get install libio-socket-ssl-perl

B<Using system packages (RHEL/CentOS):>

    yum install perl-IO-Socket-SSL

B<Verifying installation:>

    perl -MIO::Async::SSL -MIO::Socket::SSL -e 'print "TLS modules installed\n"'

=head2 Basic TLS Configuration

Once the modules are installed, configure TLS with certificate and key files:

    my $server = PAGI::Server->new(
        app  => $app,
        host => '0.0.0.0',
        port => 5000,
        ssl  => {
            cert_file => '/path/to/server.crt',
            key_file  => '/path/to/server.key',
        },
    );

=head2 Generating Self-Signed Certificates (Development)

For local development and testing, you can generate a self-signed certificate:

B<Quick self-signed certificate (1 year validity):>

    openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -nodes \
        -keyout server.key -out server.crt -days 365 \
        -subj "/CN=localhost"

B<With Subject Alternative Names (recommended):>

    # Create config file
    cat > ssl.conf <<EOF
    [req]
    distinguished_name = req_distinguished_name
    x509_extensions = v3_req
    prompt = no

    [req_distinguished_name]
    CN = localhost

    [v3_req]
    subjectAltName = @alt_names

    [alt_names]
    DNS.1 = localhost
    DNS.2 = *.localhost
    IP.1 = 127.0.0.1
    EOF

    # Generate certificate
    openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -nodes \
        -keyout server.key -out server.crt -days 365 \
        -config ssl.conf -extensions v3_req

B<Testing your TLS configuration:>

    # Start server
    pagi-server --app myapp.pl --ssl-cert server.crt --ssl-key server.key

    # Test with curl (ignore self-signed cert warning)
    curl -k https://localhost:5000/

B<Production certificates:>

For production, use certificates from a trusted CA (Let's Encrypt, etc.):

    # Let's Encrypt with certbot
    certbot certonly --standalone -d yourdomain.com

    # Then configure PAGI::Server
    my $server = PAGI::Server->new(
        app => $app,
        ssl => {
            cert_file => '/etc/letsencrypt/live/yourdomain.com/fullchain.pem',
            key_file  => '/etc/letsencrypt/live/yourdomain.com/privkey.pem',
        },
    );

=head2 Advanced TLS Configuration

See the C<ssl> option in L</CONSTRUCTOR> for details on:

=over 4

=item * Client certificate verification (C<verify_client>, C<ca_file>)

=item * TLS version requirements (C<min_version>)

=item * Custom cipher suites (C<cipher_list>)

    Server                  Req/sec     p99 Latency   Notes
    ---------------------------------------------------------------
    PAGI (8 workers)        10-12k      13-40ms       Async, zero errors
    Uvicorn (Python)        10-15k      varies        ASGI reference
    Hypercorn (Python)      8-12k       varies        ASGI
    Starman (Perl)          8-10k       2-3ms*        Sync prefork

    * Starman shows lower latency at low concurrency but experiences
      request timeouts under high concurrent load (500+ connections)
      due to its synchronous prefork model.

=head2 Key Findings

=over 4

=item * B<Keep-alive is essential> - Without it, throughput drops 6x and
port exhaustion errors occur under load.

=item * B<Zero errors under sustained load> - 298k requests over 30 seconds
with no failures when using keep-alive connections.

=item * B<Consistent tail latency> - p99 is typically only 2x p50, indicating
predictable performance without major outliers.

=item * B<JSON overhead> - JSON serialization adds ~20% overhead vs plain text.

=back

PAGI's async architecture handles high concurrency gracefully without
queueing or timeouts, making it well-suited for WebSocket, SSE, and
bursty traffic patterns that would overwhelm traditional prefork servers.

=head2 Worker Tuning

For optimal performance, set C<workers> equal to your CPU core count:

    # Recommended production configuration
    my $server = PAGI::Server->new(
        app     => $app,
        workers => 16,  # Set to number of CPU cores
    );

Guidelines:

=over 4

=item * B<CPU-bound workloads>: workers = CPU cores

=item * B<I/O-bound workloads>: workers = 2 × CPU cores

=item * B<Development>: workers = 0 (single process)

=back

Exceeding 2× CPU cores typically degrades performance due to context
switching overhead.

=head2 System Tuning

For high-concurrency production deployments, ensure adequate system limits:

    # File descriptors (run before starting server)
    ulimit -n 65536

    # Listen backlog (Linux)
    sudo sysctl -w net.core.somaxconn=2048

    # Listen backlog (macOS)
    sudo sysctl -w kern.ipc.somaxconn=2048

PAGI::Server defaults to a listen backlog of 2048, matching Uvicorn's
default. This can be adjusted via the C<listen_backlog> option.

=head2 Event Loop Selection

PAGI::Server works with any L<IO::Async> compatible event loop. If
you are on Linux, its recommended to install L<IO::Async::Loop::EPoll>
because that is the best choice for Linux and if installed will be automatically
used.

For other systems I recommend testing the various backend loop options
and find what works best.   Your notes and updates appreciated.

=head1 RECOMMENDED MIDDLEWARE

For production deployments, consider enabling these middleware components:

=head2 SecurityHeaders

Adds important security headers to all responses. Addresses common security
scanner findings (e.g., nikto, OWASP ZAP).

    use PAGI::Middleware::Builder;

    my $app = builder {
        enable 'SecurityHeaders',
            x_frame_options           => 'DENY',           # Clickjacking protection
            x_content_type_options    => 'nosniff',        # MIME sniffing protection
            content_security_policy   => "default-src 'self'",  # XSS protection
            strict_transport_security => 'max-age=31536000';    # HSTS (HTTPS only)
        $my_app;
    };

Default headers (enabled automatically):

=over 4

=item * X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN

=item * X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff

=item * X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block

=item * Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin

=back

See L<PAGI::Middleware::SecurityHeaders> for full documentation.

=head2 Other Recommended Middleware

=over 4

=item * L<PAGI::Middleware::ContentLength> - Ensures Content-Length header

=item * L<PAGI::Middleware::AccessLog> - Request logging (if not using server's built-in)

=item * L<PAGI::Middleware::RateLimit> - Protection against abuse

=item * L<PAGI::Middleware::CORS> - Cross-origin resource sharing

=item * L<PAGI::Middleware::GZip> - Response compression
