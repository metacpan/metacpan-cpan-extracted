NAME
    Web::Paste::Simple - simple PSGI-based pastebin-like website

SYNOPSIS
            #!/usr/bin/plackup
            use Web::Paste::Simple;
            Web::Paste::Simple->new(
                    storage    => Path::Class::Dir->new(...),
                    codemirror => "...",
                    template   => Text::Template->new(...),
            )->app;

DESCRIPTION
    Web::Paste::Simple is a lightweight PSGI app for operating a pastebin-like
    website. It provides syntax highlighting via the CodeMirror
    <http://codemirror.net/> Javascript library. It should be fast enough for
    deployment via CGI.

    It does not provide any authentication facilities or similar, instead
    relying on you to use subclassing/roles or Plack middleware to accomplish
    such things.

  Constructor
    `new(%attrs)`
        Standard Moose-style constructor.

        This class is not based on Moose though; instead it uses Moo.

  Attributes
    The following attributes are defined:

    `storage`
        A Path::Class::Dir indicating the directory where pastes should be
        stored. Pastes are kept indefinitely. Each is a single file.

    `codemirror`
        Path to the CodeMirror syntax highlighter as a string. For example, if
        CodeMirror is available at `http://example.com/js/lib/codemirror.js`
        then this string should be `http://example.com/js` with no trailing
        slash.

        This defaults to an address on my server, but for production sites,
        *please* set up your own copy: it only takes a couple of minutes; just
        a matter of unzipping a single archive. I offer no guarantees about
        the continued availability of my copy of CodeMirror.

        Nothing is actually done with this variable, but it's passed to the
        template.

    `template`
        A Text::Template template which will be used for *all* HTML output.
        The following variables are available to the template...

        *   $DATA - the text pasted on the curent page (if any), already HTML
            escaped

        *   $MODE - the currently selected syntax highlighting mode (if any),
            already HTML escaped

        *   @MODES - all configured highlighting modes

        *   $CODEMIRROR - the path to codemirror

        *   $APP - the blessed Web::Paste::Simple object

        *   $REQUEST - a blessed Plack::Request for the current request

        *   $PACKAGE - the string "Web::Paste::Simple"

        *   $VERSION - the Web::Paste::Simple version number

        The default template is minimal, but works.

    `modes`
        The list of CodeMirror highlighting modes to offer to the user.

        Nothing is actually done with this variable, but it's passed to the
        template.

    `default_mode`
        The default highlighting mode.

    `uuid_gen`
        A Data::UUID object used to generate URIs. The default should be fine.

  Methods
    The following methods may be of interest to people subclassing
    Web::Paste::Simple.

    `app`
        Technically this is another attribute, but one that should not be set
        in the constructor. Call this method to retrieve the PSGI coderef.

        This coderef is built by `_build_app` (a Moo lazy builder).

    `dispatch`
        Basic request router/dispatcher. Given a Plack::Request, returns a
        Plack::Response.

    `create_paste`
        Given a Plack::Request corresponding to an HTTP `POST` request, saves
        the paste and returns a Plack::Reponse. The response may be an arror
        message, success message, or (as per the current implementation) a
        redirect to the paste's URI.

    `retrieve_paste`
        Given a Plack::Request and a paste ID, returns a Plack::Response with
        a representation of the paste, or an error message.

    `show_error`
        Given an error string and optionally an HTTP status code, returns a
        Plack::Response.

    `show_template`
        Given a Plack::Request and a hashref of data (possibly including
        `paste` and `mode` keys) returns a Plack::Response with the rendered
        template, and the pasted data plugged into it.

    `make_paste_id`
        Returns a unique ID string for a paste. The current implementation is
        a base64-encoded UUID.
