2.02
  - Fixed bug (Ticket 31927)
    URIs in the HREF attribute of an A element are now encoded where needed
    unless and encoding entity is already found (%[A-Fa-f0-9]{2}), for which
    we then assume the URI is already encoded (like you should!)
    Thanks to and Fayland Lam for reporting the bug and Clinton Gormley 
    ('DRTECH') for advice.
    
2.01
  - Removed debugging line

2.00
    === API CHANGE ===
    The options html_tags, no_html and no_jslink are  no longer supported 
    by the new method. It _will_ break your code. The reason for this is the 
    implementation of scanning the output with HTML::StripScripts::Parser 
    (and the reason for that are the piling XSS-related bug reports ;-)
    ==================

  - Bumped up to version 2.00 due to the API CHANGE.
  - html_tags has been removed
  - no_html has been removed
  - no_jslink has been removed
  - HTML::StripScripts::Parser has been implemented for security reasons
  - Fixed XSS bug (Ticket 28830)
    Thanks to Jürgen Peters ('TAULMARIL') for reporting the bug and 
    helping me fix it (as well as Clinton Gormley ('DRTECH') for offering 
    help with his module!).

  - This module has basically been built from scratch again, for a lot
    of problems were spotted by various users (THANKS ALL!). The module now

    linebreak options will ignore [code]-blocks.

  Thanx to Ken for pointing these 'flaws' out to me :)
