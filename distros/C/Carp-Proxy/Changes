Revision history for Carp-Proxy

0.16    26 Feb 2020
        t/30-attr-as_yaml.t stopped working because YAML::XS::Load
        no longer automatically blesses results as a security measure.
        Test now localizes $YAML::XS::LoadBlessed.  Updated docs
        with a section on propagating errors up from child process.

0.15    02 Mar 2015
        More changes to tests around pod2usage()

0.14    02 Mar 2015
        The format produced by pod2usage() has changed, causing tests to
        fail.  Tests now employ a regex that accepts either form.  Small
        additions to the documentation.

0.13    04 Jan 2015
        decipher_child_error() now accepts an optional argument.  More
        wordsmithing.

0.12    07 Nov 2014
        _build_proxy_name() was being ignored in sub classes.  Minor
        wordsmithing in the POD.

0.11    31 Oct 2014
        Windows platforms now skip the portion of 30-attr-context.t that
        used 'open -|' forking during testing.

0.10    29 Oct 2014
        Perl dependency moved from 5.14.0 to 5.10.0.  Also tweaked the
        t/30-attr-context.t test in hopes of picking up a few more
        Windows platforms.

0.09    25 Oct 2014
        Fixes for more Windows tests.  We now use the 'open -|' emulation
        suggested in perldoc perlfork.

0.08    Oct 23 2014
        Attempts to rectify test failures on Windows

0.07    Oct 21 2014
        POD had extraneous =for html tags

0.06    Oct 21 2014
        Tests were failing on windows for what I assume were whitespace
        issues.  In addition, I was missing three test dependencies in
        Makefile.PL

0.05    Oct 18 2014
        I neglected to specify dependencies in Makefile.PL

0.04    Oct 15 2014
        First version released to CPAN
