0.05	2008-11-16
        - as suggested by David Golden:
          - disable distribution filters if the distribution has been disabled.
          - disable default filters if all reports are disabled.
          - use javascript to toggle filters between disable/enable for above.
          - changed saved messages to alerts to be more prominent.
          - fixed notes and keys on distribution list page
          - disabled distributions now greyed out on list page
          - summary table now uses "author defaults" or "reports disabled" to
            avoid blank columns, and inform the user better.
          - labeled first column "X", for the ignore/disable column.
        - removed notion of "NONE", implemented an "ignore" flag and set the
          report type to correctly identify the report requested. This is so
          re-enabling a disabled distribution can recall the previous values.
          A by-product of this is now the author can select to not receive any
          reports by default, but select specific distributions to receieve
          reports for.

          - emphasised the customisation ability of distributions.
          - renamed navigation options
        - added ability to select which distributions to apply to which
          notifications. Only Daily Summary at the moment, but allows for
          future expansion.
