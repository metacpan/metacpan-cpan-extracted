=head1 SYNOPSIS

   #!/usr/bin/env perl
   use v5.24;
   use experimental 'signatures';
   use App::Easer V2 => 'run';
   my $app = {
      aliases     => ['foo'],
      help        => 'this is the main app',
      description => 'Yes, this really is the main app',
      options     => [
         {
            name        => 'foo',
            help        => 'option foo!',
            getopt      => 'foo|f=s',
            environment => 'FOO',
            default     => 'bar',
         },
      ],
      execute => sub ($instance) {
         my $foo = $instance->config('foo');
         say "Hello, $foo!";
         return 0;
      },
      default_child => '-self',    # run execute by default
      children => [
         {
            aliases => ['bar'],
            help => 'this is a sub-command',
            description => 'Yes, this is a sub-command',
            execute => sub { 'Peace!' },
         },
      ],
   };
   exit run($app, $0, @ARGV);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<NOTE>: this software should be considered "late alpha" maturity. I'm
mostly happy with the interface, but there are still a few things that
might get changed. I<Anyway>, if you find a release of C<App::Easer> to
work fine for you, it's fair to assume that you will not need to get a
newer one later.

App::Easer provides the scaffolding for implementing hierarchical
command-line applications in a very fast way.

Development today happens only in L<App::Easer::V2>. The legacy
interface is still available in L<App::Easer::V1>, which is also the
default but has its own documentation.


=head1 BUGS AND LIMITATIONS

Minimum perl version 5.24.
