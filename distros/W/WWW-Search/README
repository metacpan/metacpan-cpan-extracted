WHAT IS NEW IN WWW::Search 2.507?  (2008-11-29)
-----------------------------------------------

Overview of changes: 

 * tweaked WWW::Search::Test

For details, see the Changes file (updates after 2008-11-27) and/or
the pod of each affected module.


WHAT IS WWW::Search?
--------------------

WWW::Search is a collection of Perl modules which provide an API to
search engines on the world-wide web (and similar HTTP-based search
engines).  Backends for many specific engines can be obtained
separately, such as AltaVista, Ebay, HotBot, and Yahoo.  This
distribution includes two applications built from this library:
AutoSearch, a program to automate tracking of search results over
time; and WebSearch, a small demonstration program to drive the
library.

By default, WWW::Search does NOT try to emulate the default search
that you would get with each search engine's GUI.  I.e. WWW::Search
does NOT necessarily return the same results you would get by visiting
the search engine's web page.  WWW::Search performs the search in a
way that is efficient and convenient for text processing.  This might
include using the "advanced search" interface; getting "text-only"
pages; making "OR" the default query term operator instead of "AND";
ungrouping same-site results; making sure descriptions are turned on;
and increasing the number of hits per page, among other tricks.  A few
backends implement the method gui_query(), which does attempt to get
the same results as searches from the engine's default web page; after
installation, see `perldoc WWW::Search::<Backend>` for details.

Because WWW::Search depends on parsing the HTML output of web search
engines, it will fail if the search engine operators change their
format.

This base WWW::Search distribution contains a few backends that can be
used for testing.  The backend Null::Empty always returns no results;
Null::Error always returns an error condition; and Null::Count returns
a number of sample results that you can specify.  After installation,
consult `perldoc WWW::Search::Null::Count` et al. for details.

The following real, working backends (and more!) are registered at
CPAN independently (not included with this WWW::Search distribution):

There are several backends which I don't even know if they work or
not; I put them in a distribution called WWW::Search::Backends which
you can find at http://www.perl.com/CPAN/modules/by-module/WWW

There are even more backends available for manual download and
installation at http://www.idexer.com/backends/ (thanks to Jim Smyser).


REQUIREMENTS
------------

WWW::Search requires Perl5, the libwww-perl module suite, the URI
module, the HTML::Parser module, and several other modules (see
Makefile.PL for a complete list).  For information on Perl5, see
<http://www.perl.com>.  For modules, see
<http://www.perl.com/CPAN/modules>.


AVAILABILITY
------------

The latest version of WWW::Search is always available on CPAN.  Here
is a good URL for finding it:
http://www.perl.com/CPAN/modules/by-module/WWW


INSTALLATION
------------

It is highly recommended that you use CPAN.pm to install WWW::Search.
It will automatically install all the prerequisite modules and put
everything in the right places.  While connected to the internet, just
type

   perl -MCPAN -e 'install WWW::Search'

Otherwise, you can install WWW::Search as you would any perl module
library, by running the following commands in the WWW-Search-x.xx
directory after unpacking the archive (and after installing all the
prerequisite modules):

    perl Makefile.PL
    make test
    make install

On Win32, use 'nmake' instead of 'make' in the above sequence of
commands.

If you want to install a private copy of WWW::Search in your home
directory, then you should do the installation with something like
these commands:

    perl Makefile.PL INSTALLDIRS=perl PREFIX=/my/perl/lib 
    make test
    make pure_perl_install UNINST=1

Don't forget to add /my/perl/lib to your PERL5LIB environment variable
(or use lib '/my/perl/lib'; or unshift @INC, '/my/perl/lib')!


WHAT IS AutoSearch?
-------------------

The WWW::Search distribution includes a search client called
AutoSearch.  AutoSearch performs a web-based search and puts the
results set into a series of web pages.  It periodically updates this
web page, indicating how the search changes over time.  Sample output
from AutoSearch can be found at
<http://www.isi.edu/lsam/tools/autosearch/>.  Output format is
configurable.

See `perldoc AutoSearch` for details, or the DEMONSTRATION section
below for quick-start instructions.


DISCUSSION, BUG REPORTS, AND IMPROVEMENTS
-----------------------------------------

When submitting a bug report or request for help, please remember to
include:
  - the operating system name and version
  - the version of perl (this can be found from `perl -v`)
  - the version of WWW::Search (this can be found from `WebSearch -V`)
  - the version of the backend (this can be found from `WebSearch -e Yahoo -V`)
  - the code you ran to produce the error (PLEASE cut-and-paste, do not just summarize!)
  - actual output showing the error (PLEASE cut-and-paste, do not just summarize!)

There is a mailing list for WWW::Search discussion.  To subscribe,
send "subscribe info-www-search" as the body of a message to
<info-www-search-request@isi.edu>.  If you use WWW::Search at all, you
should subscribe to the mailing list.

Feedback about WWW::Search is encouraged.  If you're using it for a
neat application, please let us know.  If you'd like to (or have
already) implement and publish a new backend for WWW::Search, let us
know so we don't duplicate work.  <mthurn@cpan.org>

Backend-related bug reports ("backend ABC doesn't work") should be
sent to the author/maintainer of the backend (backend maintainers are
identified in the corresponding man page).

All other feedback, bug reports, fixes, and new backends (if you are
unwilling or unable to publish them on CPAN yourself) should be sent
to Martin Thurn <mthurn@cpan.org>.  When sending e-mail, please please
put [WWW-Search] in the subject line (or risk me losing the message
among the spam).


DEMONSTRATION
-------------

After installing the distribution, connect to the internet and type:

	# WebSearch '"Your Name Here"'

or, if you are on Win32:

        C:\> WebSearch "\"Your Name Here\""

to see where your name is mentioned on the web.  Then try:

	# AutoSearch -n me_on_the_web -s '"Your Name Here"' me
        # netscape me/index.html &

or, if you are on Win32:

	C:\> AutoSearch -n me_on_the_web -s "\"Your Name Here\"" me
        C:\> netscape me\index.html

If you are on UNIX you can add

	0 3 * * 1 /usr/local/bin/AutoSearch /path/to/me

to your crontab to update this search every week at 3:00 Monday
morning.  If you install WWW::Search::Ebay, and add the --mail option
to AutoSearch, you'll have your own private replacement for Ebay's
personal search service... WITHOUT the three-query limit!


DOCUMENTATION
-------------

See `perldoc WWW::Search` after installation for an overview of the
library.  POD-style documentation is also included in all modules and
programs, so you can do `perldoc WebSearch` and `perldoc AutoSearch`
after installation.


FUTURE PLANS
------------

Some things we need, and ideas for new features:

 - more robust test mechanism (i.e. more than just counting the number
of URLs returned) (e.g. look at the various values and make sure
they're being parsed correctly) (e.g. change_date() is really a date,
URL is really a URL, URL is not double-encoded, results are not
duplicated, etc.)  Contact <mthurn@cpan.org>

 - updates to each backend to implement the submit() method.  Contact
each backend's maintainer.

 - updates to each backend that will force WWW::Search to perform the
same search as the engine's default web GUI (I'm looking for
contributions of the precise arguments that will produce such a search
for each engine; i.e. the hash that should be passed as the second
argument to native_query).  Contact <mthurn@cpan.org>

 - test cases for WebSearch.  Contact <mthurn@cpan.org>

 - test cases for AutoSearch.  Contact <mthurn@cpan.org>

 - use LWP::ParallelUA to speed up multiple backend search requests
(I'm trying to decide what the API interface will look like; please
send suggestions).  Contact <mthurn@cpan.org>

 - add a "language" parameter to the WWW::Search object?  We would
need a critical mass of backends/engines that can search multiple
languages before this would be useful.

 - more widespread use of result tags such as description, date, size,
etc. across all backends.  Contact backend maintainers.

 - a freeze/restore interface to suspend and resume in-progress queries.

 - more backends!

Contributions are always welcome.  Send me e-mail if you plan a new
backend, or to discuss architectural changes (to avoid duplicating
work).  Contact <mthurn@cpan.org>
