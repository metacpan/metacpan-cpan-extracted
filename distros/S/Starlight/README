NAME

    starlight - a light and pure-Perl PSGI/Plack HTTP server with pre-forks

SYNOPSIS

      $ starlight --workers=20 --max-reqs-per-child=100 app.psgi
    
      $ starlight --port=80 --ipv6=1 app.psgi
    
      $ starlight --port=443 --ssl=1 --ssl-key-file=file.key
                  --ssl-cert-file=file.crt app.psgi
    
      $ starlight --socket=/tmp/starlight.sock app.psgi

DESCRIPTION

    Starlight is a standalone HTTP/1.1 server with keep-alive support. It
    uses pre-forking. It is pure-Perl implementation which doesn't require
    any XS package.

    Starlight was started as a fork of Thrall server which is a fork of
    Starlet server. It has almost the same code as Thrall and Starlet and
    it was adapted to doesn't use any other modules than Plack.

    Starlight is created for Unix-like systems but it should also work on
    Windows with some limitations.

LIMITATIONS

    Perl on Windows systems (MSWin32 and cygwin) emulates "fork" in
    perlfunc and "waitpid" in perlfunc functions and uses threads
    internally. See perlfork (MSWin32) and perlcygwin (cygwin) for details
    and limitations.

    It might be better option to use on this system the server with
    explicit threads implementation, i.e. Thrall.

    For Cygwin the perl-libwin32 package is highly recommended, because of
    Win32::Process module which helps to terminate stalled worker
    processes.

BUGS

 Windows

    There is a problem with Perl threads implementation which occurs on
    Windows systems (MSWin32). Cygwin version seems to be correct.

    Some requests can fail with message:

      failed to set socket to nonblocking mode:An operation was attempted on
      something that is not a socket.

    or

      Bad file descriptor at (eval 24) line 4.

    This problem was introduced in Perl 5.16 and fixed in Perl 5.19.5.

    See https://rt.perl.org/rt3/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=119003 and
    https://github.com/dex4er/Thrall/issues/5 for more information about
    this issue.

    The server fails when worker process calls "exit" in perlfunc function:

      Attempt to free unreferenced scalar: SV 0x293a76c, Perl interpreter:
      0x22dcc0c at lib/Plack/Handler/Starlight.pm line 140.

    It means that Harakiri mode can't work and the server have to be
    started with --max-reqs-per-child=inf option.
