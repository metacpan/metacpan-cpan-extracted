NAME

    OpusVL::Preferences - Generic DBIC preferences module

VERSION

    version 0.26

SYNOPSIS

    This is a really simple module to pull into result classes so you can
    attach preferences, rather than have to continually extend the schema
    definition where its probably not appropriate.

    Say you had an Employees class, and wanted to define the following
    preferences for a customer:

    grows_plants

    has_untidy_desk

    likes_noodles

    You would set up your Result class as follows:

            package Result::Employee;
    
            use strict;
            use Moose;
            
            extends 'DBIx::Class::Core';
    
            with 'OpusVL::Preferences::RolesFor::Result::PrfOwner';
    
            __PACKAGE__->prf_owner_init;
    
            ...

    And the ResultSet class would be:

            package ResultSet::Employee;
    
            use strict;
            use Moose;
    
            extends 'DBIx::Class::ResultSet';
    
            with 'OpusVL::Preferences::RolesFor::ResultSet::PrfOwner';
    
            ...

    This would initialise the class with 3 preferences, set to the
    appropriate defaults. Within the Employee class, the following methods
    are exposed to manage the preferences:

 Result Class Methods

  prf_get

    Get the current value of the preference (either the default or local
    copy as appropriate).

            $p = $employee->prf_get ('grows_plants');    # $p == 1

  prf_set

    Overides the default preference value for the employee in question:

            $employee = prf_set (grows_plants => 0);
            $p = $employee->prf_get ('grows_plants');    # $p == 0

  prf_reset

    Deletes any local overrides and uses the default

            $employee->prf_reset ('grows_plants');
            $p = $employee->prf_get ('grows_plants');    # $p == 1

  prf_preferences

    Returns a resultset containing PrfPreference classes.

 ResultSet Methods

  prf_defaults

    Returns a resultset of the default preferences setup for this
    resultset. Add more results to this object to add more defaults. For
    example, the following might be in the initdb routine:

            sub initdb
            {
                    my $self = shift;
    
                    $self->prf_defaults->populate
                    ([
                            { name => 'grown_plants'    => default_value => '1' },
                            { name => 'has_untidy_desk' => default_value => '1' },
                            { name => 'likes_noodles'   => default_value => '1' },
                    ]);
            }

  prf_search

    To be completed. Will allow an Employee resultset to be return using
    preferences as a search parameter.

BUGS

    None. Past, present and future.
