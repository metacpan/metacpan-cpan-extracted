     I am trying to avoid the world writables policy on pause.
     The last version was fine, but I am trying to lose the 
     'withoutworldwritables' ext. 
    
1.60 Changes
      HTML::Perlinfo::Modules
      -Improved the version extraction method for modules. 
       HTML::Perlinfo will show its version now in INFO_MODULES     

1.59 Changes
      -HTML::Perlinfo now validates as XHTML 1.0 Transitional.
      -Updated the perlinfo utility with INFO_GENERAL
      -Added 5 new tests.
      -Bug fixes:
	HTML::Perlinfo::Modules
	-The module description was not escaping POD tags, so some abstracts were garbled. 
	Fixed now. 

1.58 Changes
      -Changed title from 'Loaded Files' to 'Loaded Modules' for INFO_LOADED.
      -Minor POD update.
      -Bug fixes:
	INFO_GENERAL wasn't listed as an option in the perlinfo routine.

1.57 Changes
     -Removed INFO_CREDITS. This option would always have been out of 
date as soon as a new Perl release. Plus, the JavaScript link on 
INFO_ALL was causing errors for certain security levels of IE. Besides, 
it is not very useful. Perhaps the option will return in a future release. 
     -Removed CGI::Carp 'fatalsToBrowser'. Having this there seemed 
like a good idea, until I realized that its inclusion, forced its usage
 for users of HTML::Perlinfo. Since I don't like forcing anything on anyone,
 it has been removed.
     -Removed the test program (HTML::Perlinfo.t). I couldn't solve all of 
the persistent errors and I realized that it really makes no sense to include
 tests for this module. I can use 'perlinfo' to see if the pages are rendered properly.  

1.56 Changes
       Bug fixes:
	-Fixed some errors in HTML::Perlinfo::Modules

1.55 Changes
	Bug fixes:

	-Added strict to HTML::Perlinfo::Modules. 
	-Improved POD in HTML::Perlinfo & HTML::Perlinfo::Loaded

	-Added HTML::Perlinfo::Loaded module
	-Added INFO_LOADED option to perlinfo
	-Added 'files_in' option to HTML::Perlinfo::Modules

	-Modified Makefile.PL, since App::Info is no longer optional.
 
	-Improved error checking for perlinfo utility. 
	-Removed underscores in INFO_VARIABLES. 
	-Improved POD in Perlinfo.pm, added bug notice.

1.50 Changes:

1.49 Changes:
	-Makefile.PL changes: added use 5.006 and made App::Info optional
	-Removed the following modules: Module::CoreList, IO::Socket, File::Which, CGI
	-Added File::Which code to Common.pm, modified Apache.pm to make App::Info optional, 
         and now HTML::Perlinfo no longer requires non-core modules
	-Removed all images (ORA and mod_perl) and associated code. Simplicity is better than flash.
	Bug fixes: 
	-Fixed bug in Apache.pm that caused warnings of uninitialized value in concatenation (.) or string

1.48 Changes:
	Removed false disclaimer: "This is the last release ..."

1.47 Changes:
        *This is the last release of this module in this namespace.*
        Bug fixes:
        - Fixed Carp::croak to report error in the right place
        - Changed Perl path value in INFO_GENERAL to $^X. Previously it was searching the path.   

1.46 Changes:
        - Fixed some annoying POD formatting errors

1.45 Changes:
	- Updated pod
	- The description column appears in the perlinfo core module section
	- The info_modules method/option shows the description, instead of the path 
	HTML::Perlinfo::Modules
	- Updated lots of pod
	- Added 'desc' column
	- Made the search_dir function better report @INC errors
	- Rewrote some internal code
	- Moved the check_my_args function to Common.pm, renamed it check_module_args

1.44 Changes:
	- Added titles to the perlinfo methods
	- Improved pod
	HTML::Perlinfo::Modules:
	- Added columns parameter. This allowed me to rewrite a lot of internal code.
	- Changed color parameter to exclude color section without 3rd element in array ref
        - Improved pod
        Bug fixes:
        - Fixed a bug that excluded links of the config keys in the INFO_CONFIG section

1.43 Bug fix that breaks old versions:
	The previous version did not print the content-type header for HTML::Perlinfo::Modules. Upon
	reflection, automatically printing the header is a bad idea anyway. So the perlinfo library 
	no longer prints the content-type header. I added this feature a long time ago. But it causes 
	more problems than anything else. Users must now print the header themselves.

	Other changes:
	- Added better titles to the perlinfo pages
	- HTML::Perlinfo::Common:
		* Changed the image locations per image hosting policy. 
	- HTML::Perlinfo::Modules:
		* print_modules now returns undef when no modules are found.
		* Improved error reporting for the internal search_dir function
	- HTML.pod:
		* Added documentation for the print_htmlhead method.

1.42 Bug fixes:
	- HTML::Perlinfo::Modules:
		* Major bug fix: print_modules was printing pages with full_page set to 0. 
		  So added full_page option to print_modules. This option was mistakenly left out. 

1.41 Changes:
	- POD fixes and removal of 'use lib' from Perlinfo.pm

1.40 Changes:
	- Major reorganization of code. 
        	* Added Base.pm to handle info methods
        	* CSS methods removed. They can only be changed in the constructor now.
		* Transplanted pod from HTML::Perlinfo::HTML into HTML::Perlinfo::HTML.pod. 
		* Renamed HTML::Perlinfo::HTML.pm to HTML::Perinfo::Common.pm
		* Various pod updates to HTML::Perlinfo::Modules and HTML.pod
		* Removed info_modules test and created separate test for HTML::Perlinfo::Modules
		* Turned HTML::Perlinfo::Apache into an internal module 
		* Various improvements to Apache detection
    		* mod_perl version is now listed in info_all and info_apache
		* Removed no_links method and added universal links parameter
    		* Added header and full_page attributes
	- HTML::Perlinfo::Modules: 
        	* Renamed named parameters 'show' and 'sort' to 'from' and 'sort_by' respectively.
        	* The form parameter only accepts a directory or an array ref
        	* Created the show_only, show_inc, show_dir, and section parameters
        	* Improved the directory listing in the search summary
	Bug fixes:
