Revision history for Brannigan

2.1   2025-01-23
    - Minor documentation fixes

2.0   2025-01-23
    [ BREAKING CHANGES ]
    - Complete refactor, all packages consolidated into one
    - Terminology change: "scheme" => "schema".
    - Constructor API changed: accepts only options hash-ref, schemas must be
      registered separately via register_schema() method.
    - Schema registration API changed: add_scheme() renamed to register_schema(),
      and it now takes schema name as separate parameter:
      register_schema('name', $schema) instead of embedding the name in the
      schema hash-ref.
    - Rename `parse` functions to `postprocess` to make it clear that they're
      executed after validation. They should now return a replacement value for
      the parameter they receive, not a hash-ref.
    - Default values are calculated before validation, not after. This means
      they can fail validation if they do not comply with the defined rules.
    - Remove parameter groups in favor of global `postprocess` function (see
      NEW FEATURES section below).
    - Remove support for defining parameters via regular expressions to simplify
      the code.
    - Remove support for scope-local "_all" validators.
    - Rename custom_validation() to register_validator().
    - Remove the "max_dict" validator.
    - Remove the "ignore_missing" schema-specific option in favor of the
      global "handle_unknown" option which is more comprehensive. See the
      NEW FEATURES section below.
    - Remove the "forbidden" validator in favor of the new "handle_unknown"
      option.
    - The `process` method/function no longer returns the hash-ref of input
      parameters with an optional '_rejects' key. All processing happens
      in-place, so there's no need to return the parameter hash-ref. Instead,
      the method will return `undef` if all validations passed successfully.
      If not, a hash-ref of rejects is returned. Its structure is different than
      the previous structure in several respects:

         1. It is flattened. A parameter called "day" inside a hash parameter
            called "date" in the second value of an array parameter called
            "important_dates" will appear as "important_dates.1.date.day" in
            the rejects hash-ref if it failed validations.

         2. Instead of a list of validators that failed for a parameter, a
            hash-ref of rules and their arguments is returned.

            For example, instead of `parameter => ['required(1)']` in previous
            versions, `parameter => { required => 1 }` is returned now.

            Instead of `parameter => ['length_between(10,20)']` returned in
            previous versions, `parameter => { length_between => [10, 20] }`
            is returned now.

    [ NEW FEATURES ]
    - Allow `preprocess` functions for parameters, which are executed before
      validation. Useful for input sanitation such as remove heading and
      trailing whitespace.
    - Allow a global `postprocess` function on a schema, that receives the
      complete parameter hash-ref after all preprocessing, validation, and
      parameter-specific postprocessing had completed. This function need not
      return anything. It can directly modify the parameter hash-ref as needed.
    - Added comprehensive unknown parameter handling with three modes:
      * 'ignore' (default): Unknown parameters are preserved unchanged
      * 'remove': Unknown parameters are deleted from input
      * 'reject': Unknown parameters cause validation failure
    - Unknown parameter handling works at all nesting levels:
      * Top-level parameters
      * Nested hash structures with 'keys' definitions
      * Array items that are hashes with 'keys' definitions
      * Deep nesting at any level (e.g., data.users.0.profile.extra_field)
    - Enhanced error reporting: Unknown parameters appear in rejects hash-ref
      using dot notation paths with { unknown => 1 } structure
    - Fixed schema inheritance to work recursively with deep inheritance chains
    - Schema inheritance now properly merges parameter definitions instead of
      replacing them completely
    - Default values now work recursively for all nested structures:
      * Hash fields within arrays get their defaults applied
      * Deeply nested structures (arrays in hashes in arrays) fully supported
      * Both static values and function-based defaults work in nested contexts

    [ DOCUMENTATION & TESTING ]
    - Migrated test suite from Test::More to Test2::V0.
    - Comprehensive test suite reorganization with focused feature tests.
    - Enhanced error format documentation with comprehensive examples.
    - Added upgrade guide for migrating from 1.x to 2.0

    [ INTERNAL IMPROVEMENTS ]
    - Improved code organization and maintainability
    - Added initial schema validation using Brannigan itself
    - Finalized schemas are cached to avoid repeated processing
