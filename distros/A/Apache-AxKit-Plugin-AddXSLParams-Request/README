NAME
    Apache::AxKit::Plugin::AddXSLParams::Request - Provides a way to pass
    info from the Apache::Request to XSLT params

SYNOPSIS
      # in httpd.conf or .htaccess
      AxAddPlugin Apache::AxKit::Plugin::AddXSLParams::Request
      PerlSetVar AxAddXSLParamGroups "Request-Common HTTPHeaders"

DESCRIPTION
    A strong contender for longest package name of the year,
    Apache::AxKit::Plugin::AddXSLParams::Request offers a way to make
    information about the current client request (cookies, headers, uri
    info) available as params within XSLT stylesheets.

CONFIGURATION
    This plugin is added to the request cycle by using the AxAddPlugin
    directive.

      AxAddPlugin Apache::AxKit::Plugin::AddXSLParams::Request
  
    This package introduces the AxAddXSLParamGroups config option, which
    takes a space-seperated list of 'tags' (see PARAM GROUPS below) that are
    used to add groups of related information to the param list. Note that
    this is *not* a first-class config directive and must be added via
    PerlSetVar:

      PerlSetVar AxAddXSLParamGroups "List Of Groups"

PARAM GROUPS
    In an effort to provide an easy-to-setup way to make external data->XSL
    param mapping work while letting folks choose only the types of info
    that they are interested in, sets of related information are grouped
    with an identifying 'tag'. This tag is passed in via the
    AxAddXSLParamGroups config directive which is used to determine which
    groups of info will be passed along as params. For example:

      AxAddXSLParamGroups "Request-Common HTTPHeaders VerboseURI"

    will configure this package to include the sets of data identified by
    the Request-Common, HTTPHeaders, and VerboseURI tags.

    The param groups that this package implements are detailed below.

Request-Common
    A minimal set of common parameters extracted from the request instance.

    Param Prefix: request.*

    Implemented Fields:

    * uri
        The full URI of the current request.

    * method
        The request method (POST, GET, etc.).

    * path_info
        Additional path information.

    * filename
        The file name associated with the current request.

    Examples:

      <xsl:param name="request.method"/>
      <xsl:param name="request.uri"/>
      <xsl:param name="request.path_info"/>
      <xsl:param name="request.filename"/>
  
HTTPHeaders
    Provides access to HTTP headers sent by the client.

    Param Prefix: request.headers.*

    Implemented Fields:

    The headers sent during a request vary somewhat from client to client;
    this group will contain *all* the headers returned by the request
    object's headers_in() method using the convention:
    request.headers.*fieldname* where *fieldname* is name of the given HTTP
    header field, forced to lower case.

    If any HTTP Cookies are found in the headers, they will be parsed and
    values available as XSLT params using the naming convention:
    request.cookies.*yourcookiename*. See the Cookies group below for an
    alternative way to access cookies.

    More common headers include:

    * accept
    * content-type
    * accept-charset
    * accept-encoding
    * accept-language
    * connection
    * host
    * pragma
    * user-agent
    * from
    * referer

    Examples:

      <xsl:param name="request.headers.accept-language"/>
      <xsl:param name="request.headers.host"/>
      <xsl:param name="request.headers.user-agent"/>
      <xsl:param name="request.headers.referer"/>

Cookies
    Provides an *alternative* way to access the HTTP Cookies header for
    those folks that want to get at the cookie data but don't want to pull
    in all of the other HTTP headers.

    Param Prefix: request.cookies.*

    Implemented Fields:

    Cookie values are made available as params using the convention:
    request.cookies.*yourcookiename*

    Examples:

      <xsl:param name="request.cookies.oreo"/>
      <xsl:param name="request.cookies.chocolate-chip"/>
      <xsl:param name="request.cookies.fortune"/>

VerboseURI
    Offers fine-grained access to the URI requested (via Apache::URI's
    parse_uri() method.

    Param Prefix: request.uri.*

    Implemented Fields:

    * scheme
    * hostinfo
    * user
    * password
    * hostname
    * port
    * path
    * rpath
    * query
    * fragment

    Examples:

      <xsl:param name="request.uri.path"/>
      <xsl:param name="request.uri.scheme"/>
      <xsl:param name="request.uri.port"/>
