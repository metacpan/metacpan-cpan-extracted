<H3><A NAME="Better documentation">1.1.1. Better documentation</A></H3>
<P>The <A HREF="../quickref/qr_sdf.html">SDF Quick Reference</A> has been greatly improved. It now documents 95% of SDF's features rather than the 10% of features most frequently used.</P>
<H3><A NAME="build_title enhancements">1.1.2. build_title enhancements</A></H3>
<P>If DOC_CODE is set and DOC_NAME is not set, <A HREF="../ref/mbuild_t.html">build_title</A> will now lookup DOC_NAME via <EM>references</EM> data if it can.</P>
<P>The separator between DOC_CODE and DOC_VERSION in DOC_ID can now be controlled by setting DOC_ID_SEP. The default value is '.'.</P>
<H3><A NAME="Library search path">1.1.3. Library search path</A></H3>
<P>Previously, libraries had to be placed in the <TT>perllib/sdf/home</TT> directory. Now, <A HREF="../ref/sdf.html">sdf</A>'s new -Y option can be used to specify a comma-separated list of directories to search for libraries. For example, if you want <A HREF="../ref/sdf.html">sdf</A> to search <TT>c:\mysdflib</TT> and <TT>c:\</TT> for libraries on a MS-DOS/Windows system, the command is:</P>
<PRE>
  sdf -Yc:\mysdflib,c:\ ...
</PRE>
<P>If your search path for libraries is always the same, the <TT>SDFOPTS</TT> environment variable can be used, e.g. the following sequence of commands will have the same effect as above:</P>
<PRE>
  set SDFOPTS=-Yc:\mysdflib,c:\
  sdf ...
</PRE>
<H3><A NAME="Improved searching rules">1.1.4. Improved searching rules</A></H3>
<P>Previously, libraries had to be placed in a fixed location but modules used the same search rules as normal files. Now that <A HREF="../ref/sdf.html">sdf</A> supports a library search path, libraries, modules and normal files have different search rules. The new rules are:</P>
<TABLE BORDER>
<TR>
<TD>
<STRONG>File type</STRONG>
</TD>
<TD>
<STRONG>Directories searched</STRONG>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
libraries
</TD>
<TD>
current directory, document's directory, directories on the library path, <TT>perllib/sdf/home</TT>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
modules
</TD>
<TD>
current directory, document's directory, directories on the module path, <TT>perllib/sdf/home</TT>, <TT>perllib/sdf/home/stdlib</TT>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
normal files
</TD>
<TD>
current directory, document's directory, directories on the include path, <TT>perllib/sdf/home</TT>
</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>

<P>The library path and the module path are initialised by <A HREF="../ref/sdf.html">sdf</A>'s -Y option. The include path is initialised by <A HREF="../ref/sdf.html">sdf</A>'s -I option. Inheriting a library (via a configuration library or the <A HREF="../ref/minherit.html">inherit</A> macro) appends the library's directory to the module path and the include path.</P>
<H3><A NAME="Pretty printing enhancements">1.1.5. Pretty printing enhancements</A></H3>
<P>Language names are now case insensitive. The keywords for Perl, Java and IDL have also been improved. Python support has been added.</P>
<H3><A NAME="Localisation improvements">1.1.6. Localisation improvements</A></H3>
<P>Strings within dates and times can now be localised using the <A HREF="../ref/fdatestr.html">datestrings</A> filter. See <TT>en_au.sdl</TT> for an example.</P>
<P>A Czech locale (cz_cz) is now provided (although it doesn't have localised date strings yet).</P>
<H3><A NAME="New verbose levels and debug tracing">1.1.7. New verbose levels and debug tracing</A></H3>
<P><A HREF="../ref/sdf.html">sdf</A>'s -v option now supports additional verbose levels:</P>
<UL>
2 - show how names of files and libraries are resolved
<BR>
3 - show the directories searched for libraries
<BR>
4 - show the directories searched for modules
<BR>
5 - show the directories searched for normal files.</UL>
<P>As before, level 1 shows the post-processing actions and leaves intermediate files around.</P>
<P>In addition, <A HREF="../ref/sdf.html">sdf</A>'s new -T option can be used to switch on debug tracing. The parameter is a comma-separated list of name-value pairs where each name is a <EM>tracing group</EM> and each value is the level of tracing for that group. To get the trace output provided by the -v option, one can use the <EM>user</EM> group like this:</P>
<PRE>
  sdf -Tuser=2 ...
</PRE>
<P>This is slightly different from the -v option in that intermediate files are not implicitly kept. Additional tracing groups will be added over time (probably one per output driver).</P>
<H3><A NAME="Miscellaneous stuff">1.1.8. Miscellaneous stuff</A></H3>
<P>Class filters now support a <EM>variables</EM> parameter which implicitly defines a variable for each object. The variable name is the same as the object name with non-alphanumeric characters replaced with '_'. (This feature should simplify configuration libraries for projects.)</P>
<P>The <A HREF="../ref/mjumps.html">jumps</A> macro has been introduced as a more convenient form of the <A HREF="../ref/msubsect.html">subsections</A> macro. (This feature should simplify web pages for projects.)</P>
<P>KP and KN have been added as paragraph styles. These are shorthands for N[keep_prev] and N[keep_next] respectively.</P>
<P>SUB and SUP have been introduced as phrase styles for subscripts and superscripts respectively. (Consider these experimental features for now, as I haven't had a chance to test them.)</P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="2.001beta1 - Fixes">1.2. Fixes</A></H2>
<P>The <EM>SDF Templates</EM> link on the home page included in the distribution now points to the SDF web site as it should.</P>
<P>Mac filename handling should finally be ok now. (However, installation instructions for the Mac are yet to be added.)</P>
<P>Minor corrections have been made to the <A HREF="../user/ug_sdf.html">SDF User Guide</A>.</P>
<P>The conversion of PRN files to GIF files has been improved: a margin is no longer added as ps2gif is prone to incorrectly make it black.</P>
<P>Books generated with the <EM>fancy</EM> look now have a correctly formatted table of contents.</P>
<P>Java pretty printing has been fixed.</P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="2.001beta1 - Incompatibilities">1.3. Incompatibilities</A></H2>
<P>The <SECT>Improved search rules</SECT> may introduce some unexpected incompatibilities, particularly if custom file searching was implemented. Previously, advanced users could customise the search rules (to integrate a configuration management system, say) by overriding the <EM>FindFile</EM> subroutine. The default <EM>FindFile</EM> subroutine no longer searches <TT>perllib/sdf/home/stdlib</TT>, but otherwise, the search rule for normal files has not changed so custom <EM>FindFile</EM> routines should still hopefully work. The new routine called <EM>FileModule</EM> will need to be overriden if your custom <EM>FindFile</EM> is also needed for finding modules (or similar things like <EM>sdg</EM>, <EM>sdr</EM> and <EM>sdp</EM> files).</P>
