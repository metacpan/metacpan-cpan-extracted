# This file documents the revision history for Perl extension CatalystX-RequestModel.

0.020 - 07 February 2025
  - added new 'as_data' method that lets you retreive the model model
    selectively based on a specification.   Useful if you need just some
    attributes from the model and not all of them, or when just calling
    ->nested_params on the model feels like too loose a contract.

0.019 - 27 October 2024
  - fixed issue where omit_empty=0 was not setting empty values to []
    as documented.

0.018 - 26 June 2023
  - fix issue with expand JSON into an indexed model

0.017 - 16 May 2023
  - Allow a model to handle more than one content type

0.016 - 12 May 2023
  - Added BodyModelFor and QueryModelFor to let you use the default model for a different
    action in the current controller or relative to the current controller

0.015 - 29 April 2023
  - Sensible default path to model if left empty in subroutine attributes.
  - Allow you to set a path to the model based on the current controller namespace

0.014 - 08 April 2023
  - Added BodyModel as an alias to RequestModel and noted in the docs that
    its prefered going forward

0.011 - 30 December 2022

0.010 - 30 December 2022
  - Break out QueryModel into a separate class and method attribute.  For backwards
    compatibility we will maintain the code for the previous approach but I recommend
    changing to the new approach.  See docs.

0.009 - 26 September 2022
  - Allow RequestModel(Model1, Model2) for more concise code when you have more than
    one request model.

0.008 - 31 August 2022
  - Properly support 'omit_empty' when user doesn't bother to set the 'predicate'
  Moo/se attribute option.

0.007 - 25 July 2022
  - Specify newer Moo version in dependencies

0.006 - 24 July 2022
  - Fixed issue with incorrect error when there's an error creating the request model
  
0.005 - 23 July 2022
  - JSON Content Body Parser throws an exception when the JSON in the body is
    invalid.   This is an exception object that you can catch and handle or
    use CatalystX::Errors.

  - Added missing dependency

0.003 - 21 July 2022
