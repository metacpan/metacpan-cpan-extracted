        - switch guts to builtin::export_lexically
        - this means you'll get experimental warnings
        - This also means v5.37.2 is required.  Lexical::Sub hasn't worked
          since v5.22.  The code to use Lexical::Sub is still in place, but
          you won't reach it because the dist prereq is v5.37.2.  If there is
          any demand at all, we can tweak the prereqs.  I just don't think
          there is!
