Apache/NavBarDD version 0.75
============================

vBarDD package provides a dynamic navigation bar along the lines
of the NavBar module described in Lincoln Stein's and Doug MacEachern's
"Writing Apache Modules with Perl and C". It goes one step further in
allowing double-decker (two-level) navigation bars, where the selection
in the first level (the *master* bar) determines the contents of the 
second level (the *vassal* bar).

The module provides an object oriented API to allow for easy
customisation. The navigation bar is an object that must be created
prior to use, for example in a server start-up file, according to the
contents of a special configuration file.

The main features of the module are:

* Allows both single and two level navigation bars.
* It can be used to endow existing HTML pages with a navigation bar, or
  it can be called from mod_perl modules.
* Provides a full object oriented interface.
