=head1 NAME

OurCal::Setup - how to set up OurCal

=head1 METHOD

=head2 GET THE CODE

Either check the code out from 

    https://svn.unixbeard.net/simon/OurCal

or get it off CPAN.

=head2 INSTALL THE DEPENDENCIES

OurCal has a bunch of dependencies although most of them are fairly 
standard - you probably have a large swathe of them, especially things 
like C<LWP::Simple> and C<Template>. You only need 
C<Data::ICal::DateTime> if you want C<.ics> support>.

=head2 MAKE AN INSTANCE

If you've checked out into a web accessible directory then you're pretty 
much good to go, other than making sure everything is readable and 
executable by the web server process.

Otherwise you'll need to make a web accessible directory, copy 
C<index.cgi>, C<templates> and C<images> there and make those web 
accessible.

=head2 WRITE A CONFIG

C<OurCal::Config> will help better with this but as a suggested config.

    image_dir = images

    [providers]
    providers = default

    [default]
    type = dbi
    dsn  = dbi:SQLite:db/ourcal.db

Then create a C<db> directory and make it writeable by the web process.

=head2 SETUP THE DATABASE

There's all the SQL you need in the C<sql> directory.

=head2 YOU'RE GOOD TO GO

Feel free to add other C<.ics> files both remote and local.
