DESCRIPTION

    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::GithubMeta is a Dist::Zilla plugin to include
    GitHub https://github.com meta information in META.yml.

    It automatically detects if the distribution directory is under git
    version control and whether the origin is a GitHub repository and will
    set the repository and homepage meta in META.yml to the appropriate
    URLs for GitHub.

    Based on Module::Install::GithubMeta which was based on
    Module::Install::Repository by Tatsuhiko Miyagawa

 ATTRIBUTES

    remote

      The GitHub remote repo can be overridden with this attribute. If not
      provided, it defaults to origin. You can provide multiple remotes to
      inspect. The first one that looks like a GitHub remote is used.

    homepage

      You may override the homepage setting by specifying this attribute.
      This should be a valid URL as understood by MooseX::Types::URI.

    issues

      If true, a bugtracker URL will be added to the distribution metadata
      for the project's GitHub issues page.

    user

      If given, the user parameter overrides the username found in the
      GitHub repository URL. This is useful if many people might release
      from their own workstations, but the distribution metadata should
      always point to one user's repo.

    repo

      If give, the repo parameter overrides the repository name found in
      the GitHub repository URL.

 METHODS
