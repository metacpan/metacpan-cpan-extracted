NAME
    App::Siesh - interactive sieve shell

SYNOPSIS
            App::Siesh->run(
                debug => 0,
                user  => 'dom',
                host  => 'imap',
                tls   => 'require',
                port  => '2000',
                password => 'secret',
            );

DESCRIPTION
    App::Siesh provides a shell-like interface for manipulating sieve
    scripts using the ManageSieve protocol. If you search a command line
    utility, take a look at siesh.

OPTIONS
    debug
        Enable debugging.

    user
        Specifies the username to use when logging into the sieve server.
        This option defaults to the value of the environment variable
        "USER".

    host
        Specifies the machine to connect to. Defaults to "imap".

    port
        Specifies the remote port to connect to. Defaults to 2000.

    tls Specifies whether TLS is required ("require"), optional ("auto") or
        disables ("off"). Defaults to *auto*.

    file
        If an IO::Handle object is provdided, App::Siesh won't read commands
        from the command line prompt, but from that filehandle.

    password
        Specifies the password to login.

COMMANDS
    list
        Prints a list of all scripts on the server. The currently active
        script, if any, is marked by a *** (astersik).

        Synonyms: ls, dir

    delete *script-name* *...*
        Deletes all listed scripts. It's not possible to delete the
        currently active script, so please use deactivate first. There's no
        way to undelete a deleted script.

        If you specify *** (asterisk) as first argument to delete, the
        active script is deactivated and all scripts are deleted.

        Synonyms: rm

    edit *script-name*
        Edits a script on the server without downloading it explicitly to
        your disk first. Under the hood it creates a temporary file, puts
        the script content in it and calls $ENV{EDITOR} on it. After that
        the script is uploaded back. It's also possible to create and edit a
        new script with this command.

        If your script is syntactical incorrect, you will be prompted to
        re-edit the file or throw away your changes.

        Synonyms: vi

    copy *script-name* *script-name*
        Copies the contents of the source script-name to a target script.
        The contents of the target script are overridden.

        Synonyms: cp

    move *script-name* *script-name*
        Moves script to a destination script. The destination script is
        overridden.

        Synonyms: mv

    activate *script-name*
        Activates the listed script. User may have multiple Sieve scripts on
        the server, yet only one script may be used for filtering of
        incoming messages. This is called the active script. Users may have
        zero or one active scripts

        Synonyms: set

    deactivate
        Deactivate all scripts. Deactivation of all your scripts results in
        no filtering at all.

        Synonyms: unset

    cat *script-name*
        Print script on the standard output.

        Synonyms: type

    view *script-name*
        Calls $ENV{PAGER} or "less" on script. In case of any error, we fall
        back to use cat.

        Synonyms: more

    quit
        Terminates the sessiion with the remote SIEVE server. An end of file
        will also terminate the session and exit.

        Synonyms: q, logout

    help
        Print a short description of all commands.

        Synonyms: h

    put *file-name* *script-name*
        Store a local file as script on the remote machine.

    get *file-name* *local-name*
        Retrieve a remote script and store it on the local machine.
