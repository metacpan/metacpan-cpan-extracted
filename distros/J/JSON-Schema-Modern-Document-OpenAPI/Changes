          - validation no longer errors on a missing media type if the
            corresponding schema is empty (true)
          - validate_request and validate_response now accept an operation_id
            instead of a path_template for looking up the endpoint
            specification in the openapi document
          - treat Content-Type headers and media-type entries in openapi
            documents case-insensitively, and also match wildcards

          - implemented validate_response()
          - when validating requests and responses, values that look like
            numbers, and are evaluated as numbers in schemas, are now coerced
