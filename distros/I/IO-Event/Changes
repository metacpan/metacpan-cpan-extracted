 - closure/callback interface instead of the subclass
 - interface of IO::Event.  It's a layer.

 - OOps.  Changes for 0.702 didn't actually make it in.

0.702 2009/04/28

0.601 2005/11/04

 - API CHANGE: 
   Replaced ie_connect_timeout() with ie_connect_failed().

   portable to DragonflyBSD which probably also made it
   work on a bunch of other systems too.
