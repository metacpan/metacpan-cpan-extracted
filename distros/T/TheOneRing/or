=head1 NAME

or - The One Ring to manage all other version control systems

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  # cd svn_repository_checkout
  # or update
  # or diff
  # or commit -m "woot"

  # cd cvs_repository_checkout
  # or update
  # or diff
  # or commit -m "woot"

  # cd git_repository_checkout
  # or update
  # or diff
  # or commit -m "woot"

  # cd svk_repository_checkout
  # or update
  # or diff
  # or commit -m "woot"

=head1 DESCRIPTION

If you're a developer of multiple projects like me, you'll find
yourself needing to switch between multiple different Version Control
Systems (VCSs).  After I've worked on one project using, say, SVN for
an hour I may need to switch to a different one that's using, say,
git.  That's where I start beating my head on a wall.

Not because I dislike either system; I actually like both of those.
It's because my mind thinks "check that in" and then my fingers have
already started typing "svn commit ..." instead of using "git".  It's
just habit.  The VCS should be getting out of my way, but because
there are so many it just got in my way.  I can't work on auto-pilot
because different projects need different VCSes.

95% plus percent of your version control operations are the simple
ones: modify, diff, commit, update, status, info, etc.  It's actually
fairly rare that you need to dive into the more advanced operations.
Thus, I thought, why can't I have a system that automatically figures
out what sort of checkout path I'm in and invoke the right command for
me.  Better yet, they can merge the common features of them all and do
translations to the oddballs when necessary (for example, -N in many
systems means "non-recursive" but in CVS it's "-l" (of course)).

Hence, B<The One Ring was> forged.  And it was good (not evil).

B<or> is the command line application that is a wrapper around SVN,
SVK, CVS and GIT (currently just these 4; others are easy to add).
Internally most of the work is done by the I<TheOneRing> perl module
which does the brute force of the work (which is really driving the
slave modules appropriately).

=head1 MAIN OPTIONS

The main options B<must> go before the version control command to be
processed.

=over

=item  -d

=item  --debug

Turn on debugging output

=item  -n

=item  --dryrun

Dry run only; just show what would be done.

=back

=head1 SUPPORTED COMMANDS

The following are the currently supported commands that or
understands and can convert from one system to the next.  Their
individual options are shown as well.  The individual options B<must>
go after the command.

=head1 EXAMPLE

Debugging: use the -d and -n switch just to see what it'll do:

  # or -d -n commit -m "do a commit"
  found subtype SVK
  running SVK->commit
  would run: 'svk' 'commit' '-m' 'do a commit'

=head1 CAVEATS

B<or> will B<never> replace all the other command line utilties and
wrap around them completely.  There B<will> be times you'll need to
switch back to your natice client for complex operations.  But by that
point, your brain will likely already be thinking about the version
control system in question and it won't be a big leap to switch back.

=head1 STATUS

Alpha; it's just begun.  But I'm already using it.  Expect some bumps
though, or missing features.
