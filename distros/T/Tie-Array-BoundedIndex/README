PURPOSE
-------

Tie::Array::BoundedIndex lets you create arrays whose indices have
limited ranges.  To find out more, either install the module and use
the command:

	$ perldoc Tie::Array::BoundedIndex

or, if you haven't installed it yet,type

	$ perldoc lib/Tie/Array/BoundedIndex.pm

This module is an expanded version of an example developed in the book
"Perl Medic: Transforming Legacy Code". See http://www.perlmedic.com/.

INSTALLATION
------------

Use Module::Build:

	$ perl Build.PL
	$ ./Build
	$ ./Build test
	$ ./Build install

but if you happen to do it the old way:

	$ perl Makefile.PL
	$ make
	$ make test
	$ make install

well then, the magic of Module::Build will make it work anyway.
