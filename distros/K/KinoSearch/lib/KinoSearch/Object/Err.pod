=head1 NAME

KinoSearch::Object::Err - Exception.

=head1 DEPRECATED

The KinoSearch code base has been assimilated by the Apache L<Lucy> project.
The "KinoSearch" namespace has been deprecated, but development continues
under our new name at our new home: L<http://lucy.apache.org/>

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Scalar::Util qw( blessed );
    my $bg_merger;
    while (1) {
        $bg_merger = eval {
            KinoSearch::Index::BackgroundMerger->new( index => $index );
        };
        last if $bg_merger;
        if ( blessed($@) and $@->isa("KinoSearch::Store::LockErr") ) {
            warn "Retrying...\n";
        }
        else {
            # Re-throw.
            die "Failed to open BackgroundMerger: $@";
        }
    }



=head1 DESCRIPTION

Most of the time when KinoSearch encounters an error, it tries to raise a
KinoSearch::Object::Err exception with an error message and context
information.

At present, it is only safe to catch exceptions which are specifically
documented as catchable; most times when an Err is raised, KinoSearch leaks
memory.

The Err module also provides access to a per-thread Err shared variable via
set_error() and get_error().  It may be used to store an Err object
temporarily, so that calling code may choose how to handle a particular
error condition.







=head1 INHERITANCE

KinoSearch::Object::Err isa L<KinoSearch::Object::Obj>.
