Revision history for Perl extension Getopt::OO.

0.01  Wed Dec 29 14:07:26 2004
    - original version; created by h2xs 1.23 with options
        -XA -n Getopt::OO
0.02  Sun Jan 16, 2005
    - Cleaned up documentation.
    - Added test cases and fixed one bad test case.
    - Fixed problems in required and mutual_exclusive options.
    - Modified mutual_exclusive so it will accept either a 
      list of lists or a list as necessary.
    - Tested with Cygwin under Windows with PERL 5.8 and 
      under SuSE linux with PERL 5.8.5 and 5.5.4.
    - Got rid of 'our' keyword so we would work with perl 5.5.
    - Modified the test case to not use Test::More which isn't
      available on the older releases.
0.03  Monday Jan 17, 2005
    - Added additional error checking so we would catch 
      invalid multi-character short options.
    - Added an other_args option to fill out the usage statement.
    - Modified usage message so we print the required options.
    - Updated the README and Changes files which were missed
      in 0.02.
    - Made changes so we should work under PERL 5.004 but this
      has not yet been tested.
0.04 Sunday 1/23/2004
    - Renamed the other_args to be other_values to make things
      more consistent.
    - other_values no takes a number instead of a string and can
      be used to help the parser know how many arguments are expected
      after all the options have been parsed.
    - Changes so we would work under 5.4 perl.
    - Changes to docs to cleanup and reflect changes to code.
    - Added multi-valued option.  Syntax is --arg ... - where
      the final '-' can be either the start of the next argument
      or a free-standing dash.
    - Fixed a problem with calculation of the indent for the
      help strings.
    - Added code to better check the non-dashed tags for validity.
    - Fixed a problem that was causing options to be dropped from
      the first line of the usage output.
    - Added more test cases for new options and to better check
      old ones.
    - Print line numbers for test when test is run as
      perl -Ilib t/Getopt-OO.t

    - Fixed a problem with indent.
    - Fixed a problem with Getopt and mulit-value.
    - Added ability of other_values to use callback and ClientData.
    - Added several tests.
    - Modified error message for callback so that name of option 
      generating error is displayed.
    - This should be it for feature modifications.

    - Changes involving out other_values works.  It now uses the 
      required field and behaves in other ways as the rest of the 
      options parsing works.  Added several tests to make sure
      things were working correctly.  other_values now accepts
      both the n_values and multi_value and also works with 
      callback and client data, but it doesn't accept the 
      multiple argument.  It also can be added to the required
      field.

	- Changed the -multiple_values to be -multiple.  Name
	  seemed more suitable and hopefully won't affect too
	  many people.
	- Fix problem with the Debug and Verbose not detecting 
	  printf format statement correctly.
	- fixed minor bug with not catching invalid parameters correctly.
	- changed some error handling so error messages are more explicit.
	* Most significant change is in how the 'other_values' parameter
	  is handled.  We now place any unparsed values in the other_values
	  so it becomes easier to detect problems with the user's 
	  command line input.  Also allow setting n_values parameter of
	  other_values to 0 so you can disallow any unparsed values
	  if desired.
