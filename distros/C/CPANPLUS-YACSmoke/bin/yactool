=head1 VERSION

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 yactool [options]

 Options:
   --test	- test distributions
   --mark	- mark distributions
   --purge	- purge distributions
   --flush	- flush distributions
   -reindex - reindex CPANPLUS indices

=head1 DESCRIPTION

yactool is a simple command-line tool for L<CPANPLUS::YACSmoke>.

=head1 SWITCHES

=over

=item C<--test>

  yactool --test

  yactool --test R/RR/RRWO/Some-Dist-0.01.tar.gz

Runs tests on CPAN distributions. Arguments should be paths of
individual distributions in the author directories.  If no arguments
are given, it will download the F<RECENT> file from CPAN and use that.

By default it uses L<CPANPLUS> configuration settings. If L<CPANPLUS> is set
not to send test reports, then it will not send test reports.

=item C<--mark>

  yactool --mark Some-Dist-0.01

  yactool --mark Some-Dist-0.01 fail

Retrieves the test result in the database, or changes the test result.

It can be useful to update the status of a distribution that once
failed or was untestable but now works, so as to test modules which
make use of it.

Grades can be one of (case insensitive):

  aborted  = tests aborted (uninstallable prereqs or other failure in test)
  pass     = passed tests
  fail     = failed tests
  unknown  = no tests available
  na       = not applicable to platform or installed libraries
  ungraded = no grade (test possibly aborted by user)
  none     = undefines a grade
  ignored  = package was ignored (a newer version was tested)

=item C<--purge>

  yactool --purge

  yactool --purge Some-Dist-0.01

Purges the entries from the local cpansmoke database. The criteria for purging
is that a distribution must have a more recent version, which has previously
been marked as a C<PASS>. However, if one or more distributions are passed as a
parameter list, those specific distributions will be purged.

=item C<--flush>

  yactool --flush

  yactool --flush all

  yactool --flush old

Removes unrequired build directories from the designated CPANPLUS build
directory. Note that this deletes directories regardless of whether the
associated distribution was tested.

Default flush is 'all'. The 'old' option will only delete the older
distributions, of multiple instances of a distribution.

Note that this cannot be done reliably using last access or modify time, as
the intention is for this distribution to be used on any OS that CPANPLUS
is installed on. In this case not all OSs support the full range of return
values from the stat function.

=item C<--reindex>

  yactool --reindex

Make L<CPANPLUS> reload its indices.
