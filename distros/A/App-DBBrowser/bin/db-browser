=head1 NAME

C<db-browser> - Browse C<SQLite>/C<MySQL>/C<PostgreSQL> databases and their tables interactively.

=head1 VERSION

Version 2.303

=head1 SYNOPSIS

=head2 SQLite/MySQL/PostgreSQL/Firebird

    db-browser -h|--help

    db-browser

    db-browser database-name, ...

When the C<db-browser> is called with the argument C<-h|--help>, it shows a menu. The menu entry I<HELP> shows this
documentation - see L</OPTIONS>.

If C<db-browser> is called without arguments, the user can choose from the databases offered by the database plugin.

If C<db-browser> is called with arguments, the arguments are used as the available databases.

=head2 SQLite/Firebird

    db-browser -s|--search

C<db-browser> called with C<-s|--search> causes a new search for databases instead of using the cached data.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Before using C<db-browser>, make sure you backed up your databases.

Search and read in SQL databases: one can browse databases and their tables interactively.

The database plugins bundled with C<App::DBBrowser> provide support for the DBI drivers C<DBD::SQLite>, C<DBD::mysql>,
C<DBD::MariaDB>, C<DBD::Pg> and C<DBD::Firebird>. See L<App::DBBrowser::DB> how to write a database plugin.

=head1 NAVIGATION

=head2 Menus

=over

=item *

the C<Arrow> keys (or C<h,j,k,l>) to move up and down and to move to the right and to the left.

=item *

the C<PageUp> key (or C<Ctrl-P>) to go to the previous page, the C<PageDown> key (or C<Ctrl-N>) to go to the next page.

=item *

the C<Home> key (or C<Ctrl-A>) to jump to the beginning of the menu, the C<End> key (or C<Ctrl-E>) to jump to the end
of the menu.

=back

With the option I<mouse> enabled it can be used the mouse with the left mouse key to navigate through the menus.

To confirm a chosen menu item use the C<Return> key.

In some sub-menus it is possible to select more then one item before C<Return> is pressed (e.g. the input filters
I<Choose Rows> and I<Choose Cols>); in such sub-menus the list of items marked with the C<SpaceBar> are added to the
chosen items when C<Return> is pressed. If a mouse mode is enabled, it can be used the right mouse key instead of the
C<SpaceBar>. A C<Ctrl-SpaceBar> inverts the made choices - so for example to select all but one select the one with the
C<SpaceBar> and then press C<Ctrl-SpaceBar>.

=head2 Read-line

=over

=item *

C<BackSpace> or C<Strg-H> to delete the character behind the cursor, C<Delete> to delete  the  character at point.

=item *

C<Strg-U> to delete the text backward from the cursor to the beginning of the line, C<Strg-K> to delete the text from
the cursor to the end of the line.

=item *

C<Right-Arrow> to move forward a character, C<Left-Arrow> to move back a character.

=item *

C<Page-Up> to move back 10 characters, C<Page-Down> to move forward 10 characters.

=item *

C<Home> or C<Strg-A> to move to the start of the line, C<End> or C<Strg-E> to move to the end of the line.

=back

To leave a C<read-line> without returning anything press C<Ctrl-X>. When the input puffer is empty and an C<Enter> is
pressed, C<read-line> returns an empty string.

=head1 OUTPUT

The elements are right-justified if they look like a number else they are left-justified.

If the option I<squash_spaces> is enabled, leading and trailing spaces are removed from the elements and spaces are
squashed to a single white-space.

Tab characters (C<\t>) are replaces with a space.

Vertical spaces (C<\v>) are squashed to two spaces

Control characters, code points of the surrogate ranges and non-characters are removed.

See also the option group L</Output>.

C<Ctrl-F> opens a prompt. A regular expression is expected as input. This enables one to only display rows where at
least one column matches the entered pattern. See option L<Search>.

=head1 WRITE ACCESS

=head2 Create/Drop Table/View

I<Create/Drop Table/View> can be reached by selecting the prompt-line in the L</Tables Menu> if the respective option is
activated.

Selecting the prompt line of the I<Create/Drop Table/View> sub-menu allows one to set the parse settings described in
L</Insert Data>.

=head3 Create Table

If the option I<Source type of input data> is set to I<menu>, selecting I<Create Table> opens a sub-menu where one can
choose the type of the data source. If I<Source type of input data> is set to I<plain> or I<file>, the set data source
type is used automatically without showing a menu.

For the meaning of the different data source types see L<Source type of input data>.

After the data has been read the user can apply different input filters (See L<Input filters>). When the input filters
are confirmed the user is asked

=over

=item - for the table name

=item - if the first data row should be used as header

=item - if an auto increment column should be added (if the option L<Auto increment> is enabled)

=item - to edit the column names

=item - to edit the column data types

=item - to confirm the creating of the table

=back

=head3 Drop table

Drop a table. The whole table is shown before the user confirms to drop the table.

=head3 Create View

Before creating a view: print the required select-statement to make it available in the subquery menu.

=head3 Drop View

Drop a view. The whole view is shown before the user confirms to drop the view.

=head2 Insert Into/Update/Delete

I<Insert Into>, I<Update> and I<Delete> can be reached by selecting the prompt-line in the L</SQL Menu> if the
respective option is activated.

I<Delete>, I<Update> or I<Insert Into>  may not be available with C<JOIN> and C<UNION> statements.

Selecting the prompt line of the I<Insert Into/Update/Delete> sub-menu allows one to set the parse settings described in
L</Insert Data>.

=head3 Insert Into

If the option I<Source type of input data> is set to I<menu>, selecting I<Insert Into> opens a sub-menu where one can
choose the type of the data source. If I<Source type of input data> is set to I<plain> or I<file>, the set data source
type is used without showing a menu.

For the meaning of the different data source types see L<Source type of input data>.

After the data has been read the user can apply different input filters (See L<Input filters>).

If the first column of a table is an auto-increment column, the C<INSERT INTO> statement is build without this first
column. This feature is available if supported by the database plugin.

=head3 Update

Update records. The affected (and not yet updated) records are shown shown before the user confirms the update.

See also I<Subqueries> in L</Extensions>

=head3 Delete

Delete records. The affected records are shown before the user confirms the deletion.

=head2 Data Input

=head3 Source type of input data

=over

=item Plain

Insert the data cell by cell.

=item File

The data is read from a chosen file.

Supported file formats: text files and file formats supported by L<Spreadsheet::Read>.

Selecting I<From File> opens the I<Source file directory> sub-menu where one can choose the directory which should be
searched for files.

If L<Directory history> is set to C<1> and a directory has been saved, this menu is skipped and the directory is chosen
automatically.

After a directory has been chosen a sub-menu is opened where one can choose the source file.

Selecting the prompt line of the source file sub-menu allows one to set the parse settings described in L</Insert Data>.
If the previous sub-menu I<Source file directory> is not shown due to the settings described before, additionally to the
parse settings it is also possible the change the source file directory in this sub-menu by selecting I<NEW search>.

=back

See also the input filter L</Reparse> in I<Input filters>, which allows one to change the parse-settings and then
re-read the data.

=head3 Input filters

=over

=item Choose Cols

Use only selected columns of the imported data.

If the data has empty columns (C<-->), the non-empty columns are preselected. Columns are regarded as
empty if the values of all fields in the column - including the column header - have no length.

If the selected columns of a previous I<Choose Cols> usage are a subset of the current available columns, this subset
of columns is preselected. A I<RESET> removes this preselection.

Columns added with the filter I<Append Col> are empty and therefore not preselected.

If a column is not empty, but has no header name the header is named temporarily C<tmp>.

=item Choose Rows

Use only selected rows of the imported data.

If the data has empty rows, the non-empty rows are preselected. Rows are regarded as empty if the values of all fields
in the row have no length.

=item Range Rows

Use only a range of rows.

=item Row Groups

If the input has rows with different numbers of columns, I<Row Groups> sorts rows with the same number of columns in a
group. The user can then choose one or more groups of rows. There is only one group, if all rows have the same column
count.

=item Remove Cell

Remove a cell from a chosen row.

=item Insert Cell

Insert a cell in a chosen row. The new cell is inserted in front of a chosen cell.

=item Append Col

Append an empty column. Appends a header element to the header row and adjusts the remaining rows to the length of the
header row. If the input has rows with different numbers of cells, use the I<Row Group> filter first to select the right
row-group.

=item Split Column

In the replacement it can be used the variable C<$c> as a counter. C<$c> is set to C<0> before each C<s///>.

Available modifiers: C<g>, C<i>, C<e>.

By selecting the prompt line (C<Choose:>) one can save search & replace instructions for later use.

If a search & replace has altered the first row of the input data, a menu entry named C<RESTORE header row> is offered.

I<Join Columns> can be used to edit a column by selecting only one column.

=item Fill up Rows

If the input table rows have different numbers of cells, this filter appends empty cells to the rows until the cell
count of the rows are equal to the cell count of the row with highest cell count.

One can enter in the I<Row Group> filter to see if the table has rows with different length. If I<Row Group> shows only
one group, all rows have the same length.

=item Cols to Rows

Transpose columns to rows.

=item Quote identifiers

If set to C<YES>, SQL identifiers are quoted.

=back

C<SQLite>:

- databases in SQL statements (C<ATTACH DATABASE>) are always quoted.

- if the current database has attached databases, the use of qualified table names is enabled automatically.

=head3 View prefix

Enter a string which should be automatically put in front of all view names.

=head3 Auto increment

Setting I<Auto increment> to a value which is not the empty string enables the option to set an auto increment column
when creating a table. The value set here is then used as the default name for the auto increment column.

=head3 Col data types

If this option is enabled and a table is created, C<SQL::Type::Guess> is used to detect the data types. These data types
are then used as default values when the user is asked for the data types.

=head3 Auto Limit

Sets C<LIMIT> automatically to I<Auto Limit>. This can be overwritten by setting a SQL C<LIMIT> statement manually.
Fetched table rows are kept in memory.

To disable the automatic limit set I<Auto Limit> to C<0>.

=head2 Output

=head3 Truncate column threshold

Columns with a width below or equal I<Trunc col threshold> are only trimmed if it is still required to lower the row
width despite all columns wider than I<Trunc col threshold> have been trimmed to I<Trunc col threshold>.

=head3 Truncate fractions first

If the terminal width is not wide enough and I<Trunc fract first> is enabled, the first step to reduce the width of the
columns is to truncate the fraction part of numbers to 2 decimal places.

=head3 Progress bar

Set the progress bar threshold. If the number of fields (rows x columns) is higher than the threshold, a progress bar is
shown while preparing the data for the output.

=head3 Tab width

Set the number of spaces between columns.

=head3 Color

Enables the support for color and text formatting escape sequences (SGR) if set to C<Enable>. Before the output it is
added a reset (C<\e[0m>) at the end of each row.

=head3 Binary binary

Setting the I<binary_filter> to C<1> means: print "BNRY" instead of arbitrary binary data. If data matches the repexp
C</[\x00-\x08\x0B-\x0C\x0E-\x1F]/>, it is considered arbitrary binary data. Printing arbitrary binary data could break
the output.

=head3 Squash spaces

If I<squash_spaces> is enabled, consecutive spaces are squashed to one space and leading and trailing spaces are removed.

=head3 Indentation

Set the indentation width for the SQL substatements.

=head3 Set string

=head4 Undef

Set the string that will be shown on the screen instead of an undefined field.

On C<MSWin32> only single-byte character sets are supported when entering the setting I<Undef>, I<user>, I<host> or
I<port> with the C<db-browser>s readline. But it is possible to edit the entry in configuration files directly after the
entry was created with this options menu.

=head4 Decimal separator

Set the decimal separator. Numbers with a decimal separator are formatted as number if this option is set to the right
value.

Allowed values: a character with a print width of C<1>. If an invalid value is passed, I<decimal_separator> falls back
to the default value (dot).

=head3 Warnings

Enable/disable C<File::Find> warnings when searching for C<SQLite> databases.

=head2 Insert Data

=head3 Data source menu

Set the data source type to C<plain>, C<file> or C<menu> for C<Insert Into> and for C<Create Table>.

If this option is set to C<menu>, a menu is offered where the user can choose the type of the data source. If this
option is set to C<plain> or C<file>, the respective setting is used directly without any menu.

=head3 Parse tool for 'file'

Set how to parse text files. Files where C<-T $filename> returns true are considered text files.

If a file is not a text file, then it is always used C<Spreadsheet::Read> to parse the file regardless of this setting.

Text::CSV

To decode the files it is used the L</File encoding>.

Advantages:

=over

=item

Allows to set different csv-related options.

split

Reads to whole input at once and splits the input with the input record separator (IRS) to get the records (rows). Then
it splits the records with the input field separator (IFS) to get the fields (columns) of each record.

To decode the files it is used the L</File encoding>.

Advantages:

=over

=item

The values assigned to the IRS and the IFS are treated as regexps.

Template

Uses C<unpack> with the C<A> character to break up input lines.

C<unpack> used with C<A> strips trailing whitespace. For leading whitespace to user has the option to remove it or not.
Any remaining column separators can be removed with the I<Search & Replace> filter.

If the row length is greater than the screen width, make notes of the number of columns and the length of each column
before using I<Template>.

Advantages:

=over

=item

Good for input with fixed-columns-length.

Spreadsheet::Read

If C<Spreadsheet::Read> is chosen, the default settings from L<Spreadsheet::Read> are used.

C<Spreadsheet::Read> will use the first line of the file to auto-detect the separation character if the file is a
csv-file.

C<Spreadsheet::Read::rows> fills up uneven rows automatically so the filter L<Fill up Rows> and L<Row Groups> have no
meaning if C<Spreadsheet::Read> is used.

Advantages:

=over

=item

Auto-detects the separation character for csv-files

=head3 csv settings-b

Set Text::CSV options not mentioned in I<csv settings-a>:

For the meaning of the different options see L<Text::CSV>.

=head3 'split' settings

=over

=item

Record separator

Set the input record separator (regexp).

=item

Trim record left

Expects a regex pattern. If set, removes leading characters matching regexp from each record.

=item

Trim record right

Expects a regex pattern. If set, removes trailing characters matching regexp from each record.

=item

Field separator

Set the input field separator (regexp).

=item

Trim field left

Expects a regex pattern. If set, removes leading characters matching regexp from each field.

=item

Trim field right

Expects a regex pattern. If set, removes trailing characters matching regexp from each field.

=back

=head3 Enable input filter

Enable the input filter menu.

Enabling I<input filter> will cause a second copy of the data to be kept in memory.

=head3 Empty to Null

Set the I<empty_to_null> defaults for the different data source types.

=head3 File encoding

How to decode text files.

=head3 Directory history

Set how many searched directories should be saved in the directory history.

A value of C<0> disables the history.

If I<Directory history> is set to C<1> and a directory has been saved, the directory is chosen automatically without
showing the history menu.

=head3 File filter

This option expects as its value a string. The string is used as a glob pattern.

If I<file> is selected as the data source type, only files matching this glob pattern are part of the available files.

=head3 Show hidden files

If I<file> is selected as the data source type, this setting determines if hidden files are part of the available files
or not.

=head2 Export to CSV

=head3 Destination folder

Set the folder where the data to be exported will be saved as a CSV file.

=head3 Auto-File-Extension

If this option is enabled, the file extension C<csv> is added automatically to the file-name.

=head3 Encoding to CSV

Set the C<Text::CSV::csv>-option C<encoding>.

=head1 CONFIGURATION FILES

To find out the location of the configuration files call C<db-browser -h> and choose I<Path>. The data is saved in JSON
format.

=head1 REQUIREMENTS

=head2 Perl version

Requires Perl version 5.14.0 or greater.

=head2 Decoded strings

C<db-browser> expects decoded strings.

Non mappable characters will break the output.

=head2 Terminal

It is required a terminal that uses a monospaced font which supports the printed characters.

The terminal has to understand ANSI escape sequences. If the OS is MSWin32 C<App::DBBrowser> uses
L<Win32::Console::ANSI> which emulates an ANSI console for the C<db-browser>.

=head2 Permissions

To be able to browse the database-, schema- and table-lists and the content of tables the user must have the database
privileges required for fetching the requested data.

The C<db-browser> expects an existing home directory with read and write permissions for the user of the C<db-browser>.
