1.42	Fri May 30 2003

	- _ping() method taught to use File::MMagic to determine the 
	  image's contenttype. (Image::Magick doesn't always return an 
	  'image/foo-bar' string for an image's 'format'.)

	- The 'type' attribute in hash ref returned by import() is 
	  deprecated in favour of new 'extension' attribute.

	- Added 'contenttype' attribute to hash ref returned by 
	  import() method.

	- Added requirement for Test::More in Makefile.PL

	- Downgraded requirements for Image::Magick to 5.44
