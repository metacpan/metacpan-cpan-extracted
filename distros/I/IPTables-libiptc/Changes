Revision history for Perl extension IPTables::libiptc.

Recent changes

0.52    Wed Nov 30 11:21:52 CET 2011

	- This is a bugfix release, fixing memory leaks.

	- This release is only relevant for people using this module
	  under a daemon or other long lived programs.

	- Newer version of iptables/libiptc support doing several
	  commits on the same handle.  This module, chooses to not to
	  use this option, and instead release/free the handle after a
	  commit.


0.51    Wed Jun 29 11:37:42 EDT 2011

	- Support for iptables v1.4.3 until v1.4.10.

	- This is a significant change release, in-order to adapt to
          iptables ABI/API changes in release 1.4.3, which introduced
          dynamic shared libs.

	- Using the dynamic shared libs libiptc.so and libxtables.so,
          available on target system, instead of maintaining this code
          locally.

	- This version requires that the system provides a correct
          "xtables.h" header file, which corrosponds to the systems
          libxtables.so shared library.

	- To keep the iptables.c file easy maintainable, several
          original versions are included in this package.  The choosen
          versions corrospond to the API/ABI changes in libxtables.


0.18	Mon Oct 26 14:23:51 CET 2009

	- This version is compatible with iptables 1.4.1 and 1.4.2.

	- Significant changes when into 1.4.3, which thus cannot be
	  kept binary compatible with this release.  Expect to see the
	  following error "undefined symbol: xt_params" if using this
	  release anyhow.

	- The segfault issues when comparing the IPTABLES_VERSION
	  variable is handled, and is based upon the iptables detected
	  by the Makefile.PL script.  And some compile time hacks to
	  include/xtables.h


0.17	Fri Oct 23 17:21:23 CEST 2009

	- This version is only compatible with iptables 1.4.1.

	- Its not compatible with 1.4.2 and 1.4.3, because there are
	  some segfault issues when comparing the IPTABLES_VERSION
	  variable (in the dynamic loadable modules) between iptables
	  versions, 1.4.1 and 1.4.2, and also between 1.4.2 and 1.4.3.
	  It has been fixed from version 1.4.3.2 and beyond (see
	  iptables upstream git commit c4edfa63eda06).

	- This is the first version to support iptables 1.4.x, more
	  will be created shortly, for supporting 1.4.2 and 1.4.3.

	- This version also removes the work around for exit()
	  problem, done in release 0.13.  Its still a problem, but
	  its too intrusive to the iptables.c code.


0.15  Fri Jul 10 11:58:47 CEST 2009

	- Problem with list_rules_IPs() on 64-bit platforms.
	  Fixed by Colm Dougan <colm.dougan(at)replify(dot)com>


0.14  Thu Apr 16 11:37:16 CEST 2009

	- Auto-detect iptables version, but this release is only
	  compatible with all iptables 1.3.x versions.

	- This version is up-to-date with iptables 1.3.8.


0.13  Wed Apr 15 14:59:42 CEST 2009

	- Work around for exit() problem, by Alexandre Simon.
	  The C-code in iptables.c calls exit() on all errors, this
	  results in the Perl program dying.  This is now avoided by a
	  setjmp/longjmp hack by Alexandre(dot)Simon(at)ciril(dot)fr.


0.12  Tue Apr 14 15:11:32 CEST 2009

	- This version is compatible with iptables 1.3.6.

	- Use iptables.c command interface from 1.3.6.

	- Backport one of my own mainline bugfixes to chain rename
	  (upstream commit 64ff47cd, Author: Jesper Dangaard Brouer).

	- Backport bugfix "Fix /etc/network usage"
	  (upstream commit 267a5700, Author: Pablo Neira Ayuso).

	- Backport bugfix for rename command line option -E.
	  (upstream commit 2ac1fada, Author: Krzysztof Piotr Oledzki).


0.11  Thu Jul 10 10:22:39 CEST 2008

	- Skip test if not run as root user.  As I cannot make CPAN
	  tester run 'make test' as root, I simply skip these tests.
	  Credit goes to Brian D Foy, for the idea.

0.10  Tue Jul  1 13:38:56 CEST 2008

	- Add a -fPIC option to compile code as "position independent code".
	  As suggested by Matthew "Cheetah" Gabeler-Lee.  This also
	  caused problems for CPAN tester reports trying to compile it
	  on a 64-bit platform.

	- The local libiptc has been updated, to keep it up-to-date
	  with iptables libiptc 1.4.1, except for the xtables.h
	  include. But the iptables.c command interface is still from 1.3.4.

0.09  Tue Jun 17 16:06:33 CEST 2008
	- Fix output for unspecified proto was "0" change back to
	  original behaviour "all".

	- iptables-blocking: link explicit with local library
	  libiptc.a.  Install in sbin/.

0.08  Mon Jun 16 17:11:51 CEST 2008
	- New implementaion of the the "init" scalability fix, which
	  is 64-bit compatible.  This implementation is based on binary
	  search (time complexity has gone from O(n^2) to O(log(n)).

	- Revert the not accepted "init" scalability fix.

0.07  Mon Jun 16 07:08:33 CEST 2008
	- Includes the "init" scalability fix, NOT accepted upstream,
          because its not 64-bit compatible.  The initial parsing of
          the ruleset, during pull-out from kernel, is suboptimal.
	  Its gets slower when the number of chains and jump rules
	  increase.

0.06  Fri Jun 13 17:13:21 CEST 2008
	- Matthew "Cheetah" Gabeler-Lee <cheetah(at)fastcat.org>:
		Make it compile even if iptables libiptc is not on the
		system, by linking with local library object libiptc in
		library_iptc/libiptc.a.

	- libiptc: Integrated scalability fixes. Most of which has
	  been accepted upstream in 1.4.1.  Most significant
	  scalability fix is for chain name searching, used in
	  function is_chain() and iptables_do_command().

	- The local libiptc has been keept up-to-date with iptables
	  1.4.0. But the iptables.c command interface is still from 1.3.4.

	- iptables-blocking: Add an iptables command that does uses a
	  simple file lock. Can be used to replace the iptables
	  command to avoid race conditions between two iptables commands.


0.05  Tue Nov 20 12:47:11 2007
	- Bugfix: Include all files in tarball by updating MANIFEST.
	  Version 0.04 could not compile, because the tarball did not
	  contain all the relevant files (ups, didn't keep MANIFEST in
	  sync).

0.04  Thu Nov 15 16:01:16 2007
	- First CPAN release.
	  Primarily documentation updates.

0.03  Thu Jul 13 16:24:07 2006
	- Because libiptc.c contained some bugs, it has been
          necessary to include it the module and compile libiptc.a our
          self.  The module still depends on the iptables extensions
          being available on the system.

0.02  Tue Jul 4 13:17:16 2006
	- First initial working version.

0.01  Thu Jun 22 14:01:55 2006
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.23 with options
		-n IPTables::libiptc include/libiptc/libiptc.h
