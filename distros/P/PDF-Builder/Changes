3.021     2020-12-28

    Makefile.PL, CONTRIBUTING, INFO/SUPPORT, INFO/old/dist.ini.old, README.md
     Some cleanup of email addresses and obsolete support venues.

    Makefile.PL, lib/PDF/Builder.pm, t/00-all-usable.t
     New minimum version for Image::PNG::Libpng is now 0.56. There was a change
      introduced in 0.53 that broke PDF::Builder, but has now been fixed. As
      far as we know, versions 0.47 through 0.52 should still work, if you 
      happen to have that installed, but for automated install/upgrade, the 
      new minimum is now 0.56.

    lib/PDF/Builder/Resource/XObject/Image/TIFF_GT.pm
     Added some support for TIFF with alpha channel display [CTS 33, with some
      help from 'carygravel']. Limited testing due to lack of sample .tif 
      files, and currently not doing anything about transparency mask type or
      any higher-numbered PhotometricInterpretation types.

    tools/1_pc.pl, lib/PDF/Builder/Resource/Glyphs.pm, 
      t/gif-png-pnm-rt120397-tiff.t
     Clean up a few things Perl Critic doesn't like, and exclude a few more
      frivolous things (in the exclusion list).

    lib/PDF/Builder.pm, t/00-all-usable.t
     Consolidate "optional" library versions to make update easier.

    lib/PDF/Builder/Basic/PDF/File.pm
     Change grep from expression format to { }, per PDF::API2 change.

    README.md (added), README (removed), MANIFEST
     Replace the plain text README with a markdown-formatted README.md

     Change any "no warnings" directive to "use warnings", and fix any
      resulting issues. This makes perlcritic and CPAN kwalitee a bit happier.

      For now, just commented out "no warnings". If no reports of problems,
      will physically remove commented-out lines in 3.022 or later. If you 
      encounter Perl warnings from specific routines, you can uncomment the
      "no warnings" and comment out "use warnings", to get past the warnings,
      but please also file a bug report!

    t/00-all-usable.t, Makefile.PL, lib/PDF/Builder.pm,
      lib/PDF/Builder/Resource/XObject/Image/TIFF_GT.pm
     Make both t-tests and runtime a bit more robust if an optional library
      (Graphics::TIFF and/or Image::PNG::Libpng) is installed, but back-level.

3.020     2020-11-29

    lib/PDF/Builder/Content-Outline-NamedDestination.pm, INFO/DEPRECATED
     Rename previously deprecated names "spline" (to "qbspline") and "pdfile"
     (to "pdf_file").

    examples/042_links
     Add some examples showing non-default positioning (fit) on 
      target PDF's page.

    lib/PDF/Builder/Basic/PDF/File.pm
     Extend cross-reference stream handling (read-in PDFs) to cover field
      widths of 5, 6, or 7 bytes (40-, 48-, or 56-bit integers). Special case
      of 8 byte (64-bit integer) where top 32 bits are all 0, is treated as
      32-bit integer to avoid requiring a 64-bit Perl build just for unpacking
      this field.

    lib/PDF/Builder.pm, lib/PDF/Builder/Docs.pm
     Per [RT 130722, RT 133131, et al.] get any /Version override (in /Catalog)
      and update the read-in PDF version (beyond 1.4, even if the PDF header
      still claims 1.4). This minimizes extraneous warnings about having to
      bump up the PDF version from what is claimed in the header.

      Cross-check parent/kids links, report orphaned objects, report objects
      referenced but not defined, report missing Info and Root objects, etc.
      The input PDF file or string is not changed, but at least it can give
      you an idea of why an error occurs, or the resulting PDF does not work
      correctly.

    lib/PDF/Builder/Basic/PDF/File.pm, INFO/RoadMap
     Per [RT 133131, Vadim Repin's fix], change Quad int unpack code from Q 
      to Q> to indicate "Big-Endian" byte order (MSB at left) for incoming data 
      field in a cross-reference stream. Apparently, with just Q, Perl will 
      assume the doubleword int is native format (for instance, Little-Endian 
      on an Intel chip).
      Note: This is a PDF 1.5+ feature (cross-reference streams) and has
            no business being in a PDF 1.4 file (the original bug report).
      Also add warning if imported file declared to be PDF 1.4 (or lower), as 
      cross-reference streams are a PDF 1.5 feature. Earlier fix had added 
      cross-reference stream support, but it really doesn't belong in PDF 1.4.

    lib/PDF/Builder/Outline.pm, lib/PDF/Builder/Basic/PDF/Objind.pm
     Per [RT 131657, Vadim Repin's fix] add weaken statements to eliminate
      "Deep Recursion" error messages.

    lib/PDF/Builder/Matrix.pm
     Per latest changes to PDF::API2, some code cleanup in Matrix.pm (no
      functional change except for adding some diagnostic carps). 

    lib/PDF/Builder.pm  
     Per [PR 139, by ppisar], replace some hard-coded checks for 
      Graphics::TIFF and Image::PNG::Libpng with calls to LA_GT() and LA_IPL().

    docs/buildDoc.pl, lib/PDF/Builder/Basic/PDF.pm, MANIFEST
     Add NAVIGATION LINKS section to go Up to parent(s), sideways to 
      Siblings, and Down to children. This enables you to get from any place 
      in the docs to any place else without (usually) having to go all the way 
      back up to index.html. PDF.pm added just for a place to put links (no
      code).
    
    lib/PDF/Builder.pm, INFO/RoadMap  minor updates

    lib/PDF/Builder.pm, README, INFO/LICENSE
     Make license-related text more consistent, and attempt to clarify the 
      relationship between the LGPL 2.1 master license and the various other 
      licenses that some files are under, as well as the ability to 
      redistribute under a higher version of LGPL. ref [CTS 35]

    Makefile.PL, t/author-critic.t, tools/1_pc.pl
     Update to fix some perlcritic warnings, enable author-critic (not useful,
      as tools/1_pc.pl does a better job of it). Suggested by 'carygravel',
      but [PR 135] rejected, as 1_pc is a superset of author-critic function.
      Can't change .perlcriticrc SEVERITY from 5 to 4, as the GitHub Actions
      CI testing appears to be using it, leading to a lot of errors.

    lib/PDF/Builder/Resource/XObject/Image/TIFF/File_GT.pm, t/tiff.t, 
      lib/PDF/Builder/Resource/XObject/Image/TIFF_GT.pm, Makefile.PL, 
      lib/PDF/Builder.pm, lib/PDF/Builder/Resource/XObject/Image/TIFF.pm,
     Fix problem with reading colormap from TIFF [GH 133], by 'carygravel'.
      Note that this requires upgrade of Graphics::TIFF from 6 to 7.

    t/tiff.t  upgrade so tests 10 and 11 are no longer always skipped. This 
      works only on a Linux system (definitely not on Windows), and makes use
      of ImageMagick and Linux utilities 'convert' and 'tiffcp'. Graphics::TIFF
      is needed for test 10, and test 9 (alpha layer) is still skipped. Thanks
      to GitHub user 'carygravel' for the upgrade.

    INFO/DEPRECATED   add a couple long-deprecated items ("PDFStr" and 
      "PDFUtf") that were missing from this file.

    INFO/RoadMap, lib/PDF/Builder/Docs.pm  add discussion on why images
      (especially JPEG) are sometimes rotated and/or flipped, and what can be
      done about it.

    t/fonts-synfont.t, t/fonts-ttf.t fix a couple paths to DejaVu fonts on
      certain Linux boxes. From 'gregoa' at Debian Perl Group.

    lib/PDF/Builder/Resource/XObject/Image/PNM.pm
     Bi-level (1 bit per pixel) PNM/PBM image was not being handled 
      correctly if the row length (width) was not a multiple of 8. Not enough 
      data was copied over to the PDF. Continuation of [RT 132844].
     Almost complete rewrite of PNM.pm to properly support all combinations
      of comments in the header, and support "plain" (ASCII) image files
      (P1..P3) and 16 bit samples for grayscale and RGB. Not yet supporting
      multiple images per file, as I don't have any firm definition!

    lib/PDF/Builder/Resource/XObject/Image/PNG_IPL.pm
     Make use of the new 'split_alpha' call in new release 0.47 of 
      Image::PNG::Libpng (this version specified as minimum, for optional
      library installation). This brings the speed for RGB and Gray scale
      with Alpha channels up to reasonable levels, as the 'vec' call is no
      longer called (4 or 8 times per pixel). Note that in contrast to
      PDF::API2, both 8 and 16bps samples are supported, and Gray scale is
      supported, at high speed; not just 8bps RGBA.

    lib/PDF/Builder/Docs.pm, Makefile.PL, README, t/00-all-usable.t
     PDF::Builder will (again) attempt to install or upgrade OPTIONAL 
      libraries (see README). Includes a warning in Makefile.PL not to be
      unduly alarmed if an optional install should fail. The user is given
      a choice of selecting none/all/specific optional libraries when 
      running Makefile.PL (default "all").

    README  add instructions for installing on pre-5.020 Perls, which may be
      adaptable to other OS's and Perls. Note that there's no guarantee that
      PDF::Builder will actually RUN on older Perls! (But you're welcome to
      try.)

    lib/PDF/Builder/Docs-Content.pm, lib/PDF/Builder/Content/Text.pm
     Fix spelling errors/typos, per report by 'carygravel'.

    lib/PDF/Builder/Resource/PaperSizes.pm
     Fix a couple missized entries (B7 and jr-Legal), added a bunch more
      sizes (mostly archaic American and British sizes): dbill, statement 
      (= student), half-letter (= student), old-paper, b-plus 
      (B+/Super-B/A3+/super-A3), arch-a, arch-b, arch-c, arch-d, arch-e, 
      arch-e1, pott, post, large-post, crown, large-crown, demy, small-demy, 
      medium, royal, small-royal, super-royal, imperial, a7, a8, a9, a10.

      Note that some "standard" sizes, such as broadsheet and foolscap, seem
      to have a different size specification depending on where you look. You
      should check that the size used matches your actual paper supply, and to
      either update PaperSizes.pm to match, or specify the MediaBox in points
      instead of by name. This is probably a good idea with any unusual,
      large, archaic, or special-order paper... you want to check what its
      actual size is before going through a lot of expensive failed printing!

    examples/HarfBuzz.pl, examples/resources/HarfBuzz_example.pdf
     In the updated 3.019 example, note that the entire AdobeMingStd-Light.otf 
      font (ttfont call) appears to be embedded, rather than just the subset. 
      This resulted in 3.019 being about 8MB larger than 3.018's version! It may
      be related to bug [RT 130041]. Use caution when embedding CJK fonts, even 
      when not using the cjkfont call, as at least some apparently don't subset.
      I replaced the font with AdobeGothicStd-Light.otf, which appears to embed 
      just a subset of the font, greatly reducing the size of the PDF file.

3.019     2020-07-27   

    lib/PDF/Builder/Content/Text.pm  Per [CTS 31], expand documentation of
      textlabel() call to emphasize that it is a standalone call, and doesn't
      play nicely with other text-output calls (such as not leaving a current
      position for the next write). It is intended for one-off labels, etc.

    lib/PDF/Builder/Content.pm, examples/HarfBuzz.pl, 
      examples/resources/HarfBuzz_example.pdf
     Support TTB (top to bottom) and BTT (bottom to top) vertical text in 
      textHS(), now that HarfBuzz::Shaper supports these modes. Requires 
      HarfBuzz::Shaper 0.23 or higher for TTB and BTT support, 0.21 for just 
      LTR and RTL support. The "example" PDF is provided in case you don't
      yet have HarfBuzz::Shaper installed, and want to see what it does. TTB is
      recommended for both normally RTL (bidirectional) and LTR languages. 
      Vertical writing is most often used with East Asian languages.

    .perl-version, Makefile.PL, README
     New minimum Perl version 5.20, which is already 6 years old, so we don't
      waste a lot of time chasing down bugs due to ancient Perl versions.
      PDF::Builder will likely work with older Perl versions, but your installer
      (e.g., cpan or cpanm) might refuse to install it.

    examples/042_links, examples/README, examples/examples_output, 
      tools/3_examples.pl, lib/PDF/Builder/Annotation.pm, MANIFEST
     Per [CTS 29], improved documentation of annotation-based links: PDF links 
      and targets.

    lib/PDF/Builder/Content.pm, lib/PDF/Builder/Resource/XObject/Image/PNM.pm
     image() and form_image() calls default x,y to 0,0, so can call without
      lower left corner x,y. PNM processing [RT 132844] fix routine forgetting 
      where it is in the PNM file and failing to read part of it. Note that
      132844 is still open, as PNM handling has not yet been thoroughly checked.

    lib/PDF/Builder/Resource/XObject/Image/PNG-PNG_IPL.pm ref PR #25 for 
      PDF::API2. Some have reported that apparently there can be some cases 
      where the deletion of some streams may cause errors in the vec() calls. 
      This may be dependent on the Perl version, use of nonstandard flags 
      (such as -e), or other unusual usage.

      helveticaboldoblique-timesroman-timesbold-timesitalic-timesbolditalic-
      symbol-zapfdingbats.pm, t/text.t
     In 3.018, the Core Font metrics (in particular, the 'wx' character widths) 
      were changed to use the values in the TTF files actually used (at least, 
      on Windows systems). Per [CTS 27] et al., I received complaints about 
      3.018 not using the exact Adobe font metrics for Core Fonts as before. I 
      have gone back to using the canonical Adobe metrics, even though (for 
      core fonts) this is likely to result in a small mismatch between the 
      indicated glyph width and the actual glyph displayed. In most cases it's 
      just one glyph grid unit wider (e.g., 667 instead of 666), which should 
      have no visible effect in any real document. However, there were a 
      handful of (rather esoteric) glyphs where the difference was 
      considerable. I compared the claimed widths for both Adobe metrics and 
      the TTF metrics, and picked one or the other, or even devised a new 
      width. These are documented in the .pm files under 'wx' (widths).

      Note that these are only the base 14 core fonts. The 15 Windows fonts 
      were not changed, as there is no Adobe AFM standard for them.

    INFO/CONVERSION, MANIFEST, README add conversion info for going from
      PDF::API2 to PDF::Builder.

3.018     2020-04-24 

    lib/PDF/Builder/Content.pm-Page.pm
     [RT 132403] clarify documentation on the two different rotate() methods.

    lib/PDF/Builder/Content/Hyphenate_basic.pm, lib/PDF/Builder/Content.pm-

      Makefile.PL, README, MANIFEST
     Implement support for use of HarfBuzz::Shaper (to shape chunks of text).
      [RT 113700] This is an optional installation (manually done). 
      examples/HarfBuzz.pl will not run if you do not have HarfBuzz::Shaper 
      installed.  HarfBuzz_example.pdf is provided in examples/resources/ in 
      case you can't (yet) run HarfBuzz.pl. It demonstrates the use of 
      HarfBuzz::Shaper for a variety of Western (ligatures and kerning), 
      Middle Eastern (script and RTL), and South and Southeast Asian scripts.

    lib/PDF/Builder/Content.pm  Add 'none' option to text underline and
      strikethrough options. This was added to permit the option (underline or
      strikethrough) to be given in the code, but allow a 'none' value in 
      those cases where drawing an underline or strikethrough is not desired.
      This is still the default.

    examples/021_synfonts, examples/examples.output, examples/README
     The synthetic font example only showed for regular BankGothic font.
      Added bold, bold-italic, and italic cases. Note that there is something
      a bit odd about Bank Gothic -- it looks like it may only have regular
      weight (no bold) and the italic is questionable.

      lib/PDF/Builder/Resource/Font/CoreFont/courier*.pm-
      helvetica*.pm-times*.pm-georgia*.pm-trebuchet*.pm-verdana*.pm
     Add full set of glyph widths to core font metrics files [RT 57248].
      This is intended to allow correct rendering of non-Latin-1 single
      byte fonts, by expanding the width listing beyond Latin-1. A utility
      is provided to read a TTF/OTF font and return glyph lists in a format
      that can be dropped into a [typeface].pm file. Only glyph widths table
      was changed (no other metrics). Arial was used for Helvetica metrics,
      BankGothic could not be found (not sure what's being substituted for
      it), and various symbology fonts were not changed. Courier "missing
      width" updated to reflect the character used to indicate a missing glyph.

    INFO/RoadMap  Update some items. Mention other packages PDF::Table,
      Text::Layout, and HarfBuzz::Shaper that may be useful.

    lib/PDF/Builder/Resource/CIDFont.pm  For TTF (ttfont) fix improper 
      ToUnicode cmap so that a PDF may be searched (was broken in 3.016).

    lib/PDF/Builder/Content.pm  Add example of using add() function to
      cancel Chrome browser scaling and Y-axis flip before new content is
      added to an existing PDF.

    lib/PDF/Builder/Content.pm, lib/PDF/Builder/Content/Text.pm
      Remind users not to use charspace() when working with a connected (script)
      font such as Arabic, Devanagari, cursive handwriting, etc. Add -nocs
      option to text line fill (justified) routines to not use any charspace()
      values when expanding or shrinking text content to fit.

    lib/PDF/Builder/Basic/PDF/File.pm. The earlier fix for corrupted xref table
      only ran under diagnostics. Now only the warning message is under the
      diagnostics flag (-diags), and the fixup attempt is always run.
