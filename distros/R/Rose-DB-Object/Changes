      accessor/mutator method names.  (Reported by Kevin McGrath)
    * Stopped the default auto-init handler from asking the convention
      manager to name foreign keys that have only partially populated
      column lists, causing it to burn through the "good" foreign key
      names.  (Patch by Douglas Wilson)

      David Bourget)

      "strict mode" quirk (or, IMO, "bug") which causes it to complain
      about a situation that is only a concern if it decided to do an
      INSERT rather than an UPDATE.  (Reported by Richard Jones)

      correctly when passed as arguments to add_on_save methods.

      by Kevin McGrath)
    * The insert_or_update() and insert_or_update_on_duplicate_key()
      helper methods now call save() instead of insert() or update()
      (passing the appropriate flags to cause an insert or update) in
      order also save child objects.  (Suggested by Kevin McGrath)

      and db_class parameters to make_classes() and the loader object.
    * Renamed some obscure convention manager methods and altered the
      default behavior of the is_map_class() method slightly.

0.65 (01.27.2006) - John Siracusa <siracusa@gmail.com>

    * More MySQL 5 bitfield fixes.  (Reported by Svilen Ivanov)
      Important note: if you are using MySQL 5.0.3 or later and you
      have one or more BIT columns in a given table, you MUST call
      meta->allow_inline_column_values(1) when setting up the 
      Rose::DB::Object-derived class that fronts the table.
    * Added missing "use ..." statements to the code generated by
      perl_class_definition().
    * Fixed a bug that prevented certain kinds of self-referential
      relationships from being initialized properly.  (Reported by

0.64 (01.19.2006) - John Siracusa <siracusa@gmail.com>

    * Worked around yet more SQLite ORDER BY bugs.
    * Improved the column trigger implementation.
    * Added support for MySQL 5's brain-dead new BIT column type.  Classes
      must allow_inline_column_values(1) to use it due to the inability of
      DBD::mysql to bind BIT values correctly without explicit calls to
      DBI's bind_param() method.
    * Use alternate strategies for extracting foreign key information from
      MySQL 5 because the old way no longer works reliably.

    * Added "select" parameter to the Manager which accetps an explicit
      list of columns to be selected.
    * It's now possible to filter based on columns that are not selected
      as part of a Manager query.
    * Extra parameters can now be passed to the method created by
      make_manager_method_from_sql()
    * Fixed several bitfield column accessor method bugs.  (Reported by 
      Svilen Ivanov)
    * The loader's make_modules() method now correctly creates *.pm files
      for auto-generated base classes.  (Reported by Sean Davis)

    * Uncommented some sections of the benchmark script that were
      accidentally left commented-out in the last release.

0.60 (12.31.2005) - John Siracusa <siracusa@gmail.com>

    * Added pre_init_hook() method to metadata objects and the loader.
    * Added overflow attribute to control the behavior when a scalar, 
      character, or varchar column value is too long.  Possible values
      are "fatal" (the default), "truncate", and "warn".
    * Serial columns are now detected correctly even when DBI returns a 
      column type of integer or bigint.  (Reported by Cees Hek)
    * Added support for bigserial columns.
    * Enum columns now have their list of valid values printed correctly
      by the perl_hash_definition() method.  (Reported by Juan Camacho)      
    * Fixed a bug that caused the loader to trip over mixed-case unique 
      keys in MySQL databases. (Reported by Juan Camacho)
    * Force MDY dates in PostgreSQL in the test suite, just in case the user
      has European dates configured.  (Reported by Cees Hek)
    * Fixed numerous PostgreSQL 7.x bugs.  (Reported by Cees Hek)
    * Modified the benchmark suite to further confine each module to its
      own private set of database rows in order to eliminate the influence
      of run order during the tests.
    * Worked around SQLite ORDER BY bugs in order to make the test suite
      function correctly.

0.59 (12.19.2005) - John Siracusa <siracusa@gmail.com>

    * Added in_array, any_in_array, and all_in_array query operators
      for filtering on PostgreSQL array columns.
    * Fixed a bug that caused certain method overrides to fail when
      using a custom metadata class with the auto-initialize feature.

      key columns and primary keys with one or more non-sequence-
      based columns.

      multiple sequence-based primary key columns, and primary keys
      with one or more non-sequence-based columns, migrating to and
      from databases with and without sequence support.  (Whew!)
    * Added a summary of the default conventions to the 
      Rose::DB::Object::ConventionManager documentation.

0.57 (12.04.2005) - John Siracusa <siracusa@gmail.com>

    * Fixed broken custom convention manager support in the loader.

0.56 (12.03.2005) - John Siracusa <siracusa@gmail.com>

    * Updated required Rose::DB version.  The 0.55 release was incorrect.

0.55 (12.03.2005) - John Siracusa <siracusa@gmail.com>

    * Added get_objects_from_sql() and make_manager_method_from_sql()
      Manager methods.
    * Made the use of prepare_cached() optional everywhere.  It's on
      by default in Rose::DB::Object, but off by default in Manager.
      Class data determines the defaults.
    * Added enum column type.

0.54 (11.30.2005) - John Siracusa <siracusa@gmail.com>

    * Added "distinct" and "fetch_only" manager parameters.
    * Added support for foreign key and relationship names as
      column prefixes in manager query parameters and sort_by
      arguments.
    * Changed manager and query builder to default unprefixed
      ambiguous columns to belong to the primary table ("t1").
    * Fixed a bug that caused make_methods() to fail for "... to one"
      relationships that have no corresponding foreign key.

    * Added cascaded delete, plus a plea in the documentation for users
      to do this in the database instead.

      relationship type for foreign keys.
    * Added *_now and *_on_save method types for foreign keys and

    * load() now returns the object itself on success, which allows
      for the convenient $obj = MyObject->new(id => 123)->load;
    * save() now returns the object itself on success, which allows
      for the convenient $obj = MyObject->new(id => 123)->save;

0.075 (09.19.2005) - John Siracusa <siracusa@gmail.com>

    * Added support for "many to many" relationships to Manager's
      "with_objects" and "require_objects" parameters.
    * Corrected a bug that could cause missing sub-objects when
      using the Manager's "with_objects" and "require_objects" 
      parameters.
    * Added warning for doing multiple LEFT OUTER JOINs that could
      cause a geometric explosion of redundant rows.

      instead of updated on save().  (Reported by Uwe Voelker.)
    * Corrected a misspelled method name in Rose::DB::Object::Cached.
      (Reported by David Glass)
    * Updated benchmark suite to include "one to many" search tests.

0.073 (09.09.2005) - John Siracusa <siracusa@gmail.com>

    * Added deferred method creation for relationships and foreign
      keys in order to make "many to many" relationship setup more
      developer-friendly.
    * Renamed default auto-method type for foreign keys and relationships
      from "get" to "get_set", since technically these foreign objects
      can be set.  They just don't go into the database at that point.
      I'll probably use a different term for that process (e.g., "add")
    * Some POD and test fixes.
