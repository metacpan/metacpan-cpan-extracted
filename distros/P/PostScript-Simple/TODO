TO-DO

better error reporting (postscript comments still?)
check landscape: possible problems with rotation
PostScript "compression", i.e. /n {newpath} bind def
code compression using single letter dictionary defs (optional?)
any postscript optimisation that can be done?
postscript font support?
define shape functions
translate / scale / rotate functions?
generate PostScript using a stack, rather than writing
  to the end of a text variable? could lead to some rather
  neat stuff (loops etc) (moved to ps:s "next gen")
different line styles (dashes) (easy)
ttf font support? (get lost!)
