NAME
    OWL::DirectSemantics - representation of the direct semantics of OWL2

SYNOPSIS
      use RDF::Trine;
      my $model = RDF::Trine::Model->temporary_model;
      RDF::Trine::Mode->parse_url_into_model($url, $model);
  
      use OWL::DirectSemantics;
      my $translator = OWL::DirectSemantics::Translator->new;
      my $ontology   = $translator->translate($model);
  
      foreach my $ax ($ontology->axioms)
      {
        if ($ax->element_name eq 'ClassAssertion')
        {
          printf("%s is of type %s.\n", $ax->node, $ax->class);
        }
      }
  
      print "The following data couldn't be translated to OWL:\n";
      print RDF::Trine::Serializer
        ->new('ntriples')
        ->serialize_model_to_string($model);

DESCRIPTION
    This distribution provides a basic framework for representing the OWL 2
    direct semantics model, and a translator to build that model from an
    RDF-based model.
