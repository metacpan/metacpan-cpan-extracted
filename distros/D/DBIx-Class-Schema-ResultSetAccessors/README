NAME
    DBIx::Class::Schema::ResultSetAccessors - Short hand ResultSet Accessors

SYNOPSIS
      # in your schema class
      __PACKAGE__->load_components(qw/
          Schema::ResultSetAccessors
      /);
      __PACKAGE__->load_namespaces;

      # in your program
      use MyApp::Schema;
      my $schema = MyApp::Schema->connect(...);
      @artists = $schema->artists->all; # same as $schema->resultset('Artist')->all;

DESCRIPTION
    Creates short hand accessor methods for each ResultSet. Accessor names
    are properly converted into lowercase and pluralized. E.g.

     LinerNote -> liner_notes
     Artist    -> artists
     CD        -> cds

METHODS
  resultset_accessor_map
    Sometimes you will not want to, or will not be able to use an
    auto-generated accessor name. A common case would be when the accessor
    name conflicts with a built in DBIx::Class::Schema method. E.g. if you
    name your Result class "Source", a pluralized version of this would be
    "sources", which is a built in method.

    This method allows you to redefine the names as you wish. Overload this
    method in your schema class and return a hashref map of Source =>
    accessor names. E.g.:

     # in your MyApp::Schema class
     sub resultset_accessor_map {
        {
            Source => 'my_sources',
            Artist => 'my_artists',
        }
     }

     # later in your code
     $schema->my_sources->all;

  resultset_accessor_name($moniker)
    This method is used to generate the accessor names. If you wish to
    create your own logic for generating the name, you can overload this
    method. The method takes a moniker (aka Source name) as a parameter and
    returns the accessor name.

    Internally it simply uses String::CamelCase to decamelize the name and
    pass it to "pluralize_resultset_accessor_name" method.

  pluralize_resultset_accessor_name($decamelized_name)
    If you only wish to overload the pluralization of the accessor name, in
    case you want to add support for a language other than English, then you
    might only want to overload this method. The method accepts decamelized
    name (e.g. liner_note) and returns properly pluralized version of it.
