	* Adding a to_hash() routine that returns metadata as a Perl hash
	
2005-07-22 Jonadab
	* Added try_harder() and adjusted parse() to support it.
	* Made retain_xml() a method, like strict_validation() and try_harder()
	  For backward compatibility, it is still also settable as an option to parse()
	* When parse fails, it now returns undef in scalar context or an empty list
	  in list context -- a false value either way.
	* Bumped version number to 0.27
        * The POD for subject() was not strictly accurate before and is now
	  more accurate, because I changed parse() slightly to do part of
	  what it says, and also elaborated on the POD to accurately reflect
	  what to_rdf() does.
	* Added some comments and fleshed out some more POD while I was tinkering.
	
2005-07-20 Jonadab
	* Use XML::Twig methods instead of hash reference structure.
	  This eliminates the HASH bug and makes to_svg() work better.
	* Bumped version number to 0.26

	* lib/SVG/Metadata.pm:  Corrected a few bugs in the printing of
	  keywords in emitted RDF.  Fixed problem with parsing publisher
	  information. 
	* scripts/svg_annotate:  Added -e flag for editing metadata.
	  Fiddled with how keywords are edited a little.

2004-10-17 23:00  bryce

	* lib/SVG/Metadata.pm:  Switching to use of HTML::Entities

	* scripts/svg_annotate:  For automatically generated titles,
	  instead of using the first filename for titles of all images, 
	  use each file's filename.

	types of inputs that parse() takes.

2004-06-20 16:41  bryce

	* Makefile.PL, lib/SVG/Metadata.pm, scripts/package_clipart.sh: I
	found that XML::Twig 3.09 was not up to snuff, so requiring the
	latest version in Makefile.PL.
	
	Also adding backend support for a bunch more metadata fields.  Much
	of this is just hooks, and the rest of the support is still TBD.
	
	Major change is making it accept RDF that is in <metadata> elements
	(where it is supposed to go, after all.)
	
	Minor change is to start shifting from author -> creator.
	
	Also fleshed out the packaging script a tad, to help automate
	processing a little.  Still a work in progress and unlikely to be
	of use to anyone but myself.
