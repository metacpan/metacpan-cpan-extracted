Revision history and release notes for dvd::rip.

0.98.11 [stable branch] Sat Mar 6 2010, joern
    Notes:
    - Event::ExecFlow version 0.64 is required for this version.
      This fixes a bug where no error messages were shown after
      ripping short. It was reported via Ubunutu Launchpad:
      https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/dvdrip/+bug/478710
      (You find it in the perl-modules/ directory, which was updated
       to the most recent versions btw)
      
    Features:
    - Updated Danish and Catalan translation. Thanks to Ysangkok,
      Kenneth Nielson and Joan Farrerons.
    - Turn "ripping short" error message into a warning, so the
      ripping process continues and it's up to the user to decide
      whether this is critical or not.

    Bugfixes:
    - Fixed h264 2pass cluster mode bug, generating a malformed
      transcode command. Reported by semkath <semkath AT arcor.de>
      and Christiaan Putter <ceputter AT googlemail.com>.

0.98.10 [stable branch] Sun Feb 22 2009, joern
    Features:
    - transcode 1.1 compatibility improved, warning about
      experimental dvd::rip support removed; there are still issues
      with some filters in the filter preview dialog; your mileage
      may vary.
    - Workaround for transcode h264 two-pass problem, so dvd::rip
      now supports h264 two-pass encoding.
    - Applied patch from Jussi Judin <jjudin+dvdrip AT iki.fi> to
      detect GraphicMagicks as an ImageMagick replacement.
    - No files will be placed in /tmp anymore, instead all temporary
      files will go to PROJECT_DIR/tmp. Thanks for the hint to
      Michael Renner <michael.renner AT gmx.de>.
    - dvdrip-master doesn't throw warnings on unneeded missing
      binaries anymore, if installed alone without the full
      (anyway on the master unneeded) packages. Suggested by
      Nicolas Chauvet <kwizart AT gmail.com>.
    - Added .ogv extension for OGG files as another option.
      Suggested by Nicolas Chauvet.

    Bugfixes:
    - Fixed cluster mode audio processing with transcode 1.1.x.
      Thanks for the report to Samuele Giovanni Tonon <samu AT
      linuxasylum.net>.
    - Fixed race condition which could result in a missing audio
      merge in cluster mode when title has one track. Based on a
      patch from Matt Lawrence <m3lawren AT uwaterloo.ca>.
    - Fixed wrong progress information (not taking chunks into
      account) in cluster mode.
    - Added a patch from Nicolas Chauvet to fix a problem with
      Fedora's Perl (setlocale).
    
0.98.9 [stable branch] Sun Oct 5 2008, joern
    Features:
    - Full support for anamorph transcoding by setting the
      pixel aspect ratio in the transcoded files if no
      resizing is applied.
    - New "Autoadjust, Clipping only" preset by Marc Sherman
      <msherman AT projectile.ca>., which makes use of the
      new anamorph transcoding feature.
    - New preference option for the default Clip & Zoom preset.
    - Updated Catalan translation.
    - New Danish translation by Ysangkok.

    Bugfixes:
    - Fixed a race condition in cluster node version detection.
      Thanks for the report to Sean Gallagher <stgallag AT gmail.com>.
    - Fixed a division by zero condition when video is not resized.
    - Fixed cluster mode problem with avi merging. Thanks for
      help debugging this to Helge Mühlmeier <H_Muehlmeier AT gmx.de>.

0.98.8 [stable branch] Thu Aug 95 2007, joern
    Bugfixes:
    - Tooltips were missing in the Preferences dialog.
    
    Features:
    - Added a small screen layout mode. The default layout
      doesn't fit well on wide screens with a small veritical
      resolution. On initial startup the "small" mode is activated,
      when the screen resolution has less than 1024 lines, but you
      can change it in the preferences at any time.
      Requested by Olivier Choquet <olivier.choquet AT gmail.com>,
      Guelden Cevik <Guelden_Cevik AT yahoo.de> and many 
      I can't remember anymore ;)
    - dvd::rip now remembers the main window size between
      sessions.  

0.98.7 [stable branch] Sun Aug 05 2007, joern
    Bugfixes:
    - tools/gensplash was missing what made "make install"
      in ./l10n fail. Thanks for the reports to
      Flavio <qazav3.0 AT gmail.com> and Joan Farrerons.
    - Cluster mode node check was disabled until a GUI
      connected to the master.
    - Small fixes regarding missing project name and utf8
      problems in the logfile. Thanks to tropikhajma
      <tropikhajma AT gmail.com>.
    - Fixed grabbing previews from the wrong title with
      on-the-fly processing. Thanks for the patch to
      Wolfram Kresse <wk AT wkresse.de>
    - Fixed problems with fping not installed in /usr/sbin.
      Now dvdrip-master supports /usr/sbin and /usr/bin as well.
      Reported by Neill Mitchell <mitchell_neill AT hotmail.com>.
    - Determine svn versions of ffmpeg properly.
    - Fixed close button in "About" dialog.

    Features:
    - A Catalan translation provided by Joan Farrerons
      <jfarrerons AT economistes.com>.
    - Spanish and Italian translation updates.
    - Added dvdrip.desktop file. Thanks to Christian Marillat.

0.98.6 [stable branch] Fri Apr 14 2007, joern
    Features:
    - Swedish and Serbian translation updates.
    
    Bugfixes:
    - Crash on first dvd::rip startup (initial configuration)
      fixed. Thanks for the report to Christian Marillat.

0.98.5 [stable branch] Fri Apr 13 2007, joern
    Notes:
    - This version requires Event::ExecFlow 0.63. Grab it
      from the perl-modules/ directory of this dvd::rip
      tarball.

    Bugfixes:
    - Fixed a typo which made the the subtitle preview
      window crash. Thanks for the report to Dario Castellarin.
    - Fixed ffmpeg preview grabbing with newer ffmpeg builds.
      Thanks for the report to Christian Marillat.
    - Fixed a buffering issue in the cluster control GUI
      when processing progress update events from the master.
      Thanks for the report to Joe Plunkett <ragnarok_it AT
      yahoo.com>.
    - Stopping a cluster node didn't work when it was actually
      executing a job.
    - Cluster node test now checks for ogmtools as well.
      Thanks for this suggestion to Bart Nagel <bart AT
      bnagel.net>.
    - Programs in cluster node check now are executed in
      C locale to prevent any problems due to different
      default locales on cluster nodes.
    - Restarting a cluster project which finished with errors
      didn't work under specific circumstances (bug in
      Event::ExecFlow).
    - Prevent putting non-audio titles with ogg container
      on a cluster, since ogmcat doesn't support ogg files
      without audio. Thanks for the report to Carlos-Manuel
      Major <cmajor AT free.fr>.

0.98.4 [stable branch] Sat Mar 24 2007, joern
    Notes:
    - Added a new dependency to the ffmpeg command line
      program. It's optional for now, but recommended,
      in particular if you're suffering from the
      preview hanging bug (see below).

    Features:
    - Experimental support for transcode 1.1.x branch. You
      get a warning if this transcode version is detected.
      Basic operation seems to work with 1.1.x, but it's not
      deeply tested yet. Please report bugs, if you find them.
      
      Preview stuff (subtitle, filters) is currently known
      not to be working with transcode 1.1.x.

    Bugfixes:
    - Fixed occasional hanging bug on preview grabbing by
      using ffmpeg instead of transcode to decode the preview
      image.
    - Fixed crash with Italian locale when opening cluster
      control menu. Patch by Davide Capodaglio <davidecapod
      AT inwind.it>.
    - Really fixed crash on DVD titles without audio. Fix
      was announced in 0.98.3 but went lost somehow.
    - Missed adding Daniel Nylander to the translators
      list of the About dialog (Swedish translation).
    
0.98.3 [stable branch] Sat Mar 10 2007, joern
    Features:
    - Project's tmp/ directory is now created with 0775
      permissions, which enables cluster mode running
      with different users belonging to the same group.
      Patch by Tom <mailbin AT comcast.net>.
    - Added swedish translation from Daniel Nylander
      <po AT danielnylander.se>

    Bugfixes:
    - Added another patch from Tom fixing cluster processes
      not running with the correct nice value.
    - "Exit dvd::rip after transcoding" didn't work.
    - Fixed off by one bug in dvd::rip command line option
      to select a specific title.
    - Try to workaround transcode hanging on preview frame
      grabbing by providing a different import filter. Based
      on comments from Francesco Romani and Jesse Heitler
      <jheitler AT po2.com>.
    - Fixed crash on DVD image paths with whitespaces. Thanks
      for their reports to Franz Brauße <mike-nought AT gmx.de>
      and Thomas Wendt <thoemy AT gmail.com>.
    - Fixed crash on DVD titles without audio. Thanks for
      the report to Edward Doolittle.
    - Fixed mplayer version detection.

0.98.2 [stable branch] Sat Nov 25 2006, joern
    Features:
    - Updated Serbian translation, now in latin variation as
      well, thanks to Filip Miletic <filmil AT gmail.com>.
    - Added Italian splash screen, thanks to Fabio Russo.
    - Dependency check: accept SVN versions of mplayer as
      well.

0.98.1 [stable branch] Fri Aug 25 2006, joern
    Features:
    - Updated spanish translation. Thanks to Sergio Cambra.
    
    Bugfixes:
    - Fixed exception when TOC reading failed for some reason.
      Thanks for the report to Jimmi <jimmi AT bglug.it>.
    - Spaces in the VOB file path were not refused but gave
      wrong error messages on TOC reading later. Made special
      character checking on project name and paths more strict.
      Reported by Google Roxxort <larspb AT hotmail.com>.
    - Preferences window: places buttons at the bottom of
      the window. Thanks for the hint to Gert Brinkmann
      <g111 AT netcologne.de>.
    - Preferences window: when changing the DVD drive from
      the popup, result checking output wasn't updated.
    - Added "Add node" button to the cluster control window
      (was lost somehow... ;)

    Notes:
    - Updated COPYRIGHT file.

0.98.0 [stable branch] Sun Aug 20 2006, joern
    Features:
    - Improved TOC reading: when lsdvd fails (version 0.16
      sometimes does), fallback to tcprobe.
    - Select longest title after TOC reading.
    - Select nice value 19 by default.
    - Improved installation procedure: most required Perl
      modules are shipped with the dvd::rip tarball and installed
      together with dvd::rip if missing on the system. Refer
      to the installation docs for details.

    Bugfixes:
    - Fixed wrong "Ripping stopped short" warning on NTSC
      movies whith wrongly detected framerate on TOC reading.
      Thanks to Ben <ben AT starlitworld.com> for his hints
      on this topic.
    - transcode options addition didn't work since Event::ExecFlow
      is in use, reported by Kyle Husmann <kyle.husmann AT gmail.com>
    - When default container preference was changed after reading
      TOC, audio widgets weren't setup up properly (e.g. vorbis
      missing for OGG containers) right after ripping.
    - Grabbed subtitle preview images didn't show up immediately
      after ripping, only after reselection of the subtitle.
    - Fixed some missing widget deactivation when no title
      was selected.
    - Preferences: missed updating the checking result text
      after creating a data directory.
    - Frame rate popdown listed wrong format depending on the
      selected system locale (e.g. 23,976 instead of 23.976)
    - Framerate / count corrections didn't show up in the TOC
      right after ripping, only after reopening the project file.
    - Changed transcode version suggestion to 1.0.2.
    - Don't reset all transcode settings to defaults after
      ripping, just these which may be affected due to
      attribute changes (e.g. correctly detected frame rate).
    - No "Save file" request appeared after ripping, even if
      ripping changed attributes and settings.
    - Cluster mode: when creating the first node, dvd::rip
      complained about creating the master node first.

0.97.13 [unstable branch] Sat Aug 5 2006, joern
    Features:
    - Updated French translation from Christophe Combelles.
    - Updated German translation.
    - Initial preferences setup:
      - Show additional message with some notes on intial setup
      - Select first DVD device by default (if HAL is present)
      - Default language setting is derived from user's locale
      - Default dvd::rip data directores is set to $HOME/dvdrip-data
      - Added a "Create directory" button besides the corresponding entries
      - Rearanged pages, so most important settings are on the first page.

    Bugfixes:
    - dvd::rip missed creating the tmp/backup.rip file. Thanks
      for the report to Ben Lancaster <lists AT benlancaster.co.uk>
    - Chapter transcoding didn't work. Thanks for reporting this one
      to Daniel <komet AT stolzesherz.de> and Robert Tell
      <robert.tell AT gmx.net>
    - Fix thumbnail generation with older ImageMagick. Thanks for
      the patch to Kevin Pulo <kev AT pulo.com.au>.
    - Grey out subtitle language selection box on the "Rip" page
      for titles without subtitles.
    - Test results in the Preferences dialog was not colored
      correctly in non-englisch environments.
    

0.97.12 [unstable branch] Sat Jul 2 2006, joern
    Notes:
    - New (optional) dependency: dvd::rip now uses HAL for DVD
      device scanning.
    - Gtk2::Ex::FormFactory 0.65 is required, which fixes a
      serious 0.64 bug.

    Features:
    - Dropped 'DVD image' ripping mode, but added a more generic
      approach of DVD input selection as a replacement. This
      way you can 'rip' from a DVD image e.g. to fulfill cluster
      mode requirements without hacking the DVD device preference
      anymore. Suggested by Stefan Ollermann <Stefan.Ollermann AT gmx.de>.
    - Added DVD device scanning using HAL. This is optional, you
      can always select the DVD device file directly.
    - French splash screen and generally updated splash screen
      design by Christophe Combelles.
    - Updated italian translation by Fabio Russo.
    - Message finetuning, added more tooltips, updated German
      translation.

    Bugfixes:
    - Removed all preference settings and dependencies for
      CD burning, since this module doesn't exist anymore.
    - Fixed minor free diskspace calculation bugs.

0.97.11 [unstable branch] Sat Jun 17 2006, joern
    Dependency notes:
    - libintl-perl resp. Locale::TextDomain 1.16 is required
    - Gtk2::Ex::FormFactory 0.64 is required
    - Event::ExecFlow 0.62 is required

    Features:
    - Filters & Preview finally ported to 0.97.x Gtk2 branch.
      Please note that transcode 1.0.2 has a bug which breaks
      most filters in the preview window :(
      This tar.gz ships a patch which fixes this issue:
      patches/transcode-1.0.x-filter-patch.txt
    - Removed utf-8 l10n workaround which isn't necessary with
      libintl-perl 1.16 anymore.
    - Added new preference setting for default subtitle grabbing
      mode. Feature request by Christian Marillat.
    - Added a hint to the subtitle grabbing radio boxes tooltips
      that subtitle grabbing may slowdown ripping process.
    - Added support for transcode 1.1.x development branch, but
      this is highly experimental.
    - Updated German translation and optimized some messages
      for GUI space. Now the German GUI isn't much wider than
      the English.

    Bugfixes:
    - Job execution: some errors could left the GUI in an
      unusable state.
    - Applied a patch from Eric Festinger <eric.festinger AT
      gmail.com> which makes changing color index B work again.
    - NPTL workaround option is disabled, if workaround is not
      possible for the running architecture (e.g. amd64).
    - Filter color mode check now ignores pure audio filters.
    - Message dialogs are not attached to the main GUI window
      anymore, which was confusing for dialogs opened from
      child windows.
    - Added a workaround for a strange Data::Dumper bug on
      some platforms (fixes 29,576 <-> 29.576 frame rate issue).

0.97.10 [unstable branch] Mon Apr 24 2006, joern
    Features:
    - Updated spanish translation (and a spanish splash screen ;).
      Thanks to Sergio Cambra.

    Bugfixes:
    - Preview grabbing didn't work due to a broken (and untested,
      my bad) fix in 0.97.9.

0.97.9 [unstable branch] Sun Apr 23 2006, joern
    Note:
    - Gtk2::Ex::FormFactory 0.63 is required for this release.
      It fixes a bug with with dvd::rip's Preference dialog.
      Thanks for the report to Niki Kovacs <contact AT kikinovak.net>.

    Bugfixes:
    - Volume scanning didn't work anymore, thanks for the report
      to Alexander Skwar.
    - dvdrip-master didn't start, still used a factored out
      module. Thanks for report & fix to Andreas Vinsander
      <andreas AT vinsander.se>
    - Under some circumstances preview grabbing didn't work due
      to missing default values for width/height settings.
      Thanks for the report to Christian Marillat.

0.97.8 [unstable branch] Mon Apr 10 2006, joern
    Note:
    - Gtk2::Ex::FormFactory 0.62 is required for this release.
      It fixes a nasty bug with recent libgtk2 versions.
      Thanks for debugging assistance to Alex Petkov
      <alexandphyllis AT excite.com>.
    
    Features:
    - Support AC3 passthrough for on-the-fly and dvd image
      encoding as well, by doing an extra audio bitrate probe
      once AC3 codec is selected on the Transcode tab.
    
    Bugfixes:
    - Fixed a divison-by-zero condition in bitrate calculation
      module, thanks for the pointer to Dhek Bhun Kho <bhun.kho
      AT gmail.com>.
    - Subtitle preview didn't work in 0.97.7 due to a missing
      module. Thanks for the report to Rafael Kolless <rafael AT
      mondoria.de>.

0.97.7 [unstable branch] Sun Apr 2 2006, joern
    Notes:
    - dvd::rip now depends on a new Perl module: Event::ExecFlow
      version 0.61. You can get it from CPAN or better from the
      exit1.org homepage: http://www.exit1.org/Event-ExecFlow/
    - Event::ExecFlow itself needs the AnyEvent module, which is
      available from CPAN:
      http://search.cpan.org/~mlehmann/AnyEvent-1.02/
    - Gtk2::Ex::FormFactory needs to be at least version 0.61
    - Event::RPC needs to be at least version 0.89
    
    Features:
    - Refactored out the internal command execution engine to
      Event::ExecFlow introducing some interesting new features.
    - New graphical progress window showing all
      jobs of the current task in a nice hierarchical
      treeview. Just hit on the magnifying glass symbol
      besides the progress bar
    - Pausing/resuming the running job by one click
    - Extensive rewrite of the cluster mode using the new
      execution engine and progress widget which visualizes
      the tree structure of cluster jobs much butter than the
      old cluster job display.
    - More cluster features are:
      - Allow cluster encoding without audio
      - You can specify a speed index for each cluster node.
      - Faster machines will be preferred.
      - vobsub file generation added
      - dvdrip-master now does a clean shutdown on signals.
      - Cluster window now has it's own menu bar with menu items
      - Connect/Disconnect the cluster master daemon from here.
    - Dropped "DVD mount dir" preference, because dvd::rip now
      determines the mount point of your DVD device automatically.
      Thanks for the suggestion to Dario Castellarin <dacstp AT
      tiscali.it>.
    - Generating preview images doesn't block the GUI anymore.
    - Improved Clip & Zoom clipping windows: added text entries
      for clipping values and meaningful warnings when values
      aren't even or not divisible by 16, which is required
      for transcodes internal processing and/or most video codecs.
    - Make "ffmpeg/af6 codec" field a combo box with presets
      for ffmpeg "mpeg4" and "h264" codecs.
    - A new nicer splash image including a Gnome compliant
      About dialog, with credits for the translators.
    - Updated Italian translation, thanks to Fabio Russo.
    - Updated German translation.
    - Added icons to the project's notebook tabs
    
    Bugfixes:
    - Preview frame grabbing failed for multi-PSU titles when
      the frame number goes beyond the first PSU. This fix
      should make the "use slow grabbing" checkbox mostly
      useless. It's still there but will likely be dropped in
      future versions.
    - TOC reading with lsdvd and DVD-image mode still accessed
      the physical DVD device instead of the DVD-image directory.
      Thanks for their reports to Triffid hunter and
      <mykhal AT centrum.cz>.
    - Disable multipass transcoding for ffmpeg/h264, since
      transcode currently doesn't support this.
    - lsdvd was used even if it was too old. Thanks for the report
      to Garnet Ulrich <garnet.ulrich AT gmx.net> and
      Sören Brunk <soerenbrunk AT gmx.de>.
    - Preferences: base project dir need to be absolute, which is
      checked now in the dialog.
    - Preferences: changed default video codec from 'divx4'
      to 'xvid4' (this was overdue... ;)
    - Consistent button behaviour: all buttons triggering
      actions now grey out if a task is active.
    - Some smaller bugfixes in the cluster mode GUI, inconsistencies
      between GUI and the master's state.
    - Clip & Zoom image windows: recalculate images only if the
      user changed something.
    - Subtitles: "Create VOBSUB now" just works on the currently
      selected subtitle. No need to mark it for vobsub creation
      anymore.
    - Fixed wrong frame counting during ripping, which resulted in
      too big frame numbers and thus incorrect bitrate calculation.
      Thanks to Christian Marillat for reporting this one.
    - Audio channel numbers on the GUI now start at 1, not at 0,
      which is more convenient.
    - Fixed regression: don't ask for project file save on exit
      if just the selected notebook page changed.
    - And a lot of more smaller bugs not counted here...

0.97.6 [unstable branch] Tue Jan 3 2005, joern
    Bugfixes:
    - Fixed off by one bugs in viewing angle and chapter
      selection. Thanks for the report to Chandler Carruth
      <chandlerc AT gmail.com>.
    - Deactivate multipass GUI elements for MPEG encodings.
    - Fixed cluster mode 'dvdrip-exec' bug introduced in 0.97.5.
      Thanks for the report to Karl Kashofer <karl AT kashofer.org>.

0.97.5 [unstable branch] Wed Dec 28 2005, joern
    Notes:
    - This version requires Gtk2::Ex::FormFactory 0.59.

    Features:
    - Set default lame/MP3 quality level to 2 instead of 0,
      which is very slow but without an appropriate quality
      gain. Thanks for the hint to Fridtjof Busse.

    Bugfixes:
    - When ripping a title again the Clip & Zoom was reset
      to 'auto_medium_fast' even if it was changed in the
      meantime.
    - When ripping multiple titles preview images were generated
      only for the first selected title. Thanks for the report
      to Fridtjof Busse.
    - MANIFEST lacked files for dvdrip-tet. Thanks for the
      report to Jacob Joseph <jmjoseph AT andrew.cmu.edu>.
    - dvdrip-tet: fixed a typo in "exit afterwards" function.
      Thanks for the report to Fridtjof Busse (again ;)
    - Store LD_ASSUME_KERNEL in tool_version_cache file and
      discard cache if LD_ASSUME_KERNEL changed in the meantime;
      fixes nptl_workaround deadlock problem on Gentoo. Thanks
      to Triffid Hunter for the detailed report.
    - Workaround Locale::TextDomain utf-8 bug, which destroyed
      8 bit characters in the GUI if an utf-8 locale was in effect.
    - Since 0.97.4 all subprocesses were executed with nice
      level 19, the GUI setting was ignored. Thanks for the report
      to Alex <gaaf AT gmx.net>,

0.97.4 [unstable branch] Sun Oct 30 2005, joern
    Bugfixes:
    - Various critical cluster mode fixes (in particular some
      endless loop conditions)
    - Subtitle preview didn't work due to conflicts with
      latest internal API changes.
    - dvd::rip rejected negative vertical subtitle offsets,
      which are absolutely valid. Thanks for the report to
      elerran <elerran AT freemail.gr>.
    - Fixed bug with wrong audio track assignment with
      old tcprobe based TOC reading (new lsdvd mode was not
      affected). Thanks for the report to Markus Frisch
      <markus AT frisch.com>
    - Volume scanning progress bar didn't work; scanned value
      didn't appear in GUI. Thanks for the report to
      Triffid Hunter.
    - dvdrip-tet crashed if a confirmation request should
      pop up. For know dvdrip-tet just assumes "Yes" to
      the question and continues.

0.97.3 [unstable branch] Sun Oct 9 2005, joern
    Notes:
    - This version requires Gtk2::Ex::FormFactory 0.58.
    - New optional dependency: with lsdvd dvd::rip reads
      DVD TOC much faster.
    - Source directory layout changed slightly. All scripts
      and binaries moved into the bin/ subdirectory. All
      additional program files now have a "dvdrip-" prefix,
      the old "dr_" prefix for some binaries was dropped.

    Features:
    - Subtitle preview images may be grabbed while ripping
      which makes finding the correct subtitles much easier
      since no long-winded preview grabbing has to be done
      later. You can chosse to rip no subs, all of them or
      by language. Aware: your CPU will glow a bit more while
      ripping if you use this feature ;)
    - dvd::rip now has a command line frontend for pure
      transcoding without any GUI: dvdrip-tet (task execution
      terminal). Just execute "dvdrip-tet" to get some help
      about the the command line options.
    - With dvdrip-replex an experimental command line
      application is shipped which does DVD shrinking based
      on a ripped DVD and the corresponding dvd::rip project
      file. Just a prove-of-concept. The functionality will
      be added to the GUI sometimes...
    - Added a simple 'configure' script to fulfill GNU Source
      Installer requirements. Thanks for the suggestion to
      Claudio Fontana <sick_soul AT yahoo.it>.
    - Ported "force slow frame grabbing" feature from 0.52 to
      0.97 branch.
    - Preferences dialog now has a "Cancel" button.
    - Added an "dvd::rip" entry to the dependency table which
      checks whether all dvd::rip command files are found
      in the PATH.

    Bugfixes:
    - Cluster control web service was broken.
    - Applied a patch from Ulrich Spoerlein <q AT galgenberg.net>
      removing the -ping option from the ImageMagick "identify"
      calls, since recent ImageMagick versions don't have this
      option anymore.
    - Applied minor patches from Ulrich Spoerlein to improve
      FreeBSD compatability.
    - Parsing output of the ImageMagick identify command was
      broken with specific filenames. Thanks for the report
      to Colin Wheat <cwheat AT ami.com.au>.
    - Dropped "identify -ping" option, since not any longer
      supported with newer versions. Thanks for the report
      to Avinash Chopde <avinash AT acm.org>.
    - X(S)VCD processing with manual bitrate setting didn't
      work. Thanks for the report to Ed Doolittle <ed.doolittle
      AT utoronto.ca>
    - dvd::rip dependency check was broken if tools didn't run
      due to NPTL issues. Switching NPTL workaround on/off
      didn't help anymore because the results were cached even
      on that case. Thanks for figuring that out to
      Joe Zbiciak <intvnut AT gmail.com>.
    - Sightly cluster mode node editor GUI improvements

0.97.2 [unstable branch] Mon Aug 1 2005, joern
    Notes:
    - You need at least Gtk2::Ex::FormFactory 0.57. Download from
      here because it may not reached all CPAN sites yet:

      http://www.exit1.org/Gtk2-Ex-FormFactory/

    Features:
    - Ported cluster mode GUI to Gtk2, including a slightly internal
      code redesign of dvdrip-master, which introduces another Perl
      module dependency: Event::RPC 0.84. Download the module from
      CPAN or from the project's homepage:

      http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-module/Event/
      http://www.exit1.org/Event-RPC

      I think I fixed a bunch of smaller bugs in the cluster
      mode during the code review and redesign as well... ;)

    - New button "Create project" on Storage page. So we have
      a definitive point when the project was created, after
      that the name may not change again and the data directory
      structure, logfile etc. is created.

    Bugfixes:
    - Preferences: changing DVD mount point and setting a directory
      as the DVD device didn't work. Thanks for the report to
      Christian Marillat.
    - When creating a new project: changing the project name
      was impossible once the name matched an existing project
      name in the dvd::rip data directory.
    - Delete volume rescale when a audio filter is set.
    - Fixed wrong viewing angle mplayer DVD command preset.
      Thanks for the report to Brian J. Murrell <brian AT 
      interlinx.bc.ca>
    - Missed log file creation for new projects.
    - Subtitle preview window was broken
    - Bitrate calculation stuff wasn't initialized correctly
      if a default BBP was set in the Preferences

0.97.1 [unstable branch] Sat Jul 23 2005, joern
    Features:
    - Extensive GUI redesign. dvd::rip now uses Gtk2 and
      Gtk2::Ex::FormFactory, so we have new dependencies
      here.

      The Perl Gtk2 binding should be part of every modern
      Linux distribution, e.g. Debian has a libgtk2-perl package.
      Otherwise grab it from CPAN (see URL below). I personally
      use version 1.082, but lower versions may work as well.

      Gtk2::Ex::FormFactory is rather new and not yet packaged
      for any Linux distro, at least I'm not aware of. Installation
      is straight forward (perl Makefile.PL && make test && make install).
      Version 0.56 is required.

      You can grab both Gtk2 and Gtk2::Ex::FormFactory from here:

      http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-module/Gtk2/

    - A bunch of smaller features / changes, in particular making
      the GUI more comfortable. Too many to list them all, just
      poke around to find them ;)

    Notes:
    - This is an ALPHA release, so please use with care, but *please*
      use it and report any bugs to the dvdrip-users list.
    - The project file format didn't change significantly. Files
      from older dvd::rip versions will just work. Even opening
      files created with 0.97.1 should work in older versions.
      As usual you should make backups nevertheless.
    - The redesign is not yet fully completed. The cluster,
      transcode filter & preview and burning stuff is currently missing.
      Cluster stuff will be added soon, filter stuff a bit later
      and burning stuff probably never: depends on user feedback ;)
    - Only the German translation is complete, other languages
      will follow.
    - The online web documentation still covers the old Gtk1
      based version. This will change with the 0.98 stable release
      based on this 0.97 branch. Since the main functionality didn't
      change much this should be no problem at all.

0.52.7 [stable branch] Sat Mar 18 2006, joern
    Bugfixes:
    - Added a workaround for strange transcode bug with VOB
      directory input
    - Backported NPTL-Workaround-Tool-Version-Caching bugfix
      into stable branch.
    - NPTL Workaround now disabled by default, because it's
      in general not necessary anymore with newer transcode
      releases and makes problems on some platforms.
    - VCD bitrate calculation wasn't accurate, multiplex
      reserve wasn't considered.
    - Adjusted transcode frame count regex to cover new output
      format of transcode 1.1.x as well.
    - Applied a patch from Ulrich Spoerlein <q AT galgenberg.net>
      removing the -ping option from the ImageMagick "identify"
      calls, since recent ImageMagick versions don't have this
      option anymore.
    - Applied minor patches from Ulrich Spoerlein to improve
      FreeBSD compatability.

0.52.6 [stable branch] Sat Jul 23 2005, joern
    Notes:
    - Using transcode newer than version 0.6.14 is *not*
      recommended. At least subtitling is broken for
      these versions, and it seems there are still
      several NPTL related issues making problems.

    Features:
    - Added LD_ASSUME_KERNEL version number entry to the
      Preferences dialog extending the NPTL workaround
      feature introduced in 0.52.4. Initially set to
      version 2.4.30, since this number seems to be more
      appropriate, while the prior 2.2.5 made problems
      at least on Gentoo. Thanks for figuring that out to
      <robert AT firehead.org>.
    - Added a "Force slow grabbing" checkbox to the Clip&Zoom
      page to workaround fast nav seeking problems with
      some DVD's. Suggested by Ivan Villanueva.
    - Updated italian translation by Fabio Russo.

    Bugfixes:
    - Cluster mode: client/server communication didn't work
      if the corresponding machines had different endianess
      (e.g. i686 vs. amd64). Thanks for the report to
      Benjamin Van Laere <B.VanLaere AT unpeu.com>.
    - Cluster mode: ogg/vorbis projects didn't work since
      0.52.5. Thanks for the reports to Sören Brunk
      <soerenbrunk AT gmx.de>, Alexander Skwar <listen AT
      alexander.skwar.name> and Knic Knic <oneeyedelf1 AT
      hotmail.com>.
    - Deferred vobsub creation didn't work if dvd::rip was
      configured to exit after transcoding. Thanks to
      Ivan Villanueva <dvdrip AT artificialidea.com> for
      the report.

0.52.5 [stable branch] Mon May 16 2005, joern
    Features:
    - Updated italian translation from Fabio Russo, which was
      *one* minute too late for the 0.52.4 release ;)

    Bugfixes:
    - Cluster mode: merging PSU chunks for a OGG/Vorbis title
      failed due to a dumb typo.

0.52.4 [stable branch] Mon May 16 2005, joern
    Features:
    - Full featured support for BPP (bits per pixel) resp.
      quality based video bitrate calculation (based on a
      request by Daniel Faber <mail AT daniel-faber.de>):
      - Permanent display of the bpp value on the transcode
	tab in a combo box
      - BPP value may be edited, video bitrate is recalculated
	accordingly, a list of reasonable preset values is
	available for convenience. BPP and bitrate follow
	changes of the frame size immediately.
      - A new preset "Default BPP" (in the misc section) is used
	by default for newly ripped titles once set.
    - Bitrate calculation sheet now shows different calculations
      depending on whether a manual bitrate was set or not.
      Suggested by Daniel Faber.
    - Subtitle preview improved; old tedious test transcoding
      dropped, instead you can open a realtime transcode preview
      window straight from the Subtitle tab without opening
      the transcode Filter dialog first. Movie starts with a
      leadtime of 15 seconds before the first subtitle timestamp.
    - Keyframe interval can be edited on the transcode page.
      transcode defaults internally to 250, now you can change
      this (dvd::rip defaults to 50).
    - Added a patch from Larry Siden <lsiden AT gmail.com>
      which makes dvd::rip compatible with dvdrecord. Just
      select "dvdrecord" as the CD burning command (a
      correspondent preset was added) and dvd::rip will
      generate a proper command line for dvdrecord.
    - Added DVD device placeholder %d to the DVD player command
      template and extended the xine and mplayer default commands
      accordingly. This is necessary if DVD devices located at a
      different path as the /dev/dvd default.
    - dvd::rip now workarounds transcode NPTL bugs by setting
      LD_ASSUME_KERNEL. If you encounter problems with this
      you can switch this off in the Preferences / Misc section.
    - Cluster mode
      - Execute jobs with umask 0002. This helps solving
	permission problems, if commands are executed by
	different users on the nodes. With this umask the
	correponding users merely need to be in the same group.
	Based on a request from Triffid Hunter <triffid_hunter
	AT funkmunch.net>.
      - Don't log fping command. It's useless and too noisy.
      - Set LD_ASSUME_KERNEL on the nodes as well if set on
	the master.

    Bugfixes:
    - mplayer CVS versions are now recognized properly. A
      CVS version always satisfies the dependency module,
      assuming people using CVS versions know what they're
      doing ;) Thanks for reports and hints to Philippe Monroux
      <monroux-listes AT wanadoo.fr>, Christian Marillat and
      Fabio Russo.
    - xvid4conf didn't read the defauls properly from
      ~/.transcode/xvid4.cfg, looks like ~ isn't substituted,
      although this is xvid4conf's own default. Now dvd::rip
      passes the full path.
    - Filters didn't work since 0.52.3. Thanks for the report
      to Christian Marillat.
    - Combo box tooltips didn't appear in the Preferences
      dialog.
    - OGG overhead wasn't calculated correctly if a frame
      range was set. Thanks for the report to Daniel Faber.
    - Filter preview window: fixed a race condition when
      starting transcode; now wait max. 10 seconds on transcode
      startup using a Glib timer. Thanks for the bug report
      to Mathias Anselmann <M.Anselmann AT web.de>.
    - Cluster mode: when merging video chunks of a PSU in an
      OGG/Vorbis project the progress information was missing.

0.52.3 [stable branch] Sun Mar 13 2005, joern
    Features
    - Updated french translation from Christophe Combelles
      <ccomb AT free.fr>
    - Skip 1st pass (if "reuse log" is checked) even if
      Ogg/Vorbis vbr audio is enabled.

    Bugfixes:
    - PCM passthrough didn't work.
    - Newer transcode release seem not to need -d for
      PCM audio tracks anymore, so it's used only with
      versions < 0.6.13.
    - Mistaken switch to RGB color space if audio only
      filters are added to the filter chain. Reported
      by Dag Rune Sneeggen <contactus AT dudcore.net>.
    - Applied a patch from Fabio Russo fixing a potential
      problem with mplayer playback of DVD titles with
      an audio codec reported by transcode as 'mpeg1',
      although neither Fabio nor I ever had such a DVD
      in the hand ;)
    - Removed POSIX::setlocale(), since it's not necessary
      and probably the reason for a crash on Mandrake.

0.52.2 [stable branch] Sun Jan 9 2005, joern
    Bugfixes:
    - Missed adding Italian and Serbin translation files to
      the distribution tarball.

0.52.1 [stable branch] Sun Jan 9 2005, joern
    Features:
    - Italian translation added by Fabio Russo and Costantino.

0.52.0 [stable branch] Tue Jan 4 2005, joern
    Notes:
    - This is just a stable release of 0.51.4. Only change
      is that the suggested transcode minimum version is 0.6.14.
    - For changes since the last stable release 0.50.18 please
      refer to the change log entries of the 0.51 branch.

0.51.4 [unstable branch] Sat Dec 13 2004, joern
    Bugfix:
    - The central dvd::rip tools dr_splitpipe and dr_progress
      where broken due to changes to the Makefile. Thanks for
      the reports to Lukas Postupa <postupa AT gmx.de> and
      Christian Marillat.

0.51.3 [unstable branch] Sat Dec 11 2004, joern
    Features:
    - Set transcode -M 2 as default for NTSC movies to improve
      A/V sync unless the user provides -M on its own using
      the transcode options entry. Suggested by Peter Hutnick
      <hutnick AT gmail.com>. Note: default is -M 1, so enter
      this to transcode's option entry if the new -M 2 doesn't
      work for you.
    - More generic Makefile for the dvd::rip parts written in C.
      Thanks for the patch to Mike Frysinger <vapier AT gentoo.org>.

    Bugfixes:
    - Cluster mode / OGM: PSU chunks were not deleted afterwards
      even if the user requsted that. Thanks for the patch to
      Jonathan Hall <flimzy AT flimzy.com>.
    - Increased portion of data to be analyzed for detailed
      audio characteristics after ripping. Should fix problems
      with wrong detection of AC3 bitrates and switching off
      AC3 passthrough. Thanks to Nicholas E Andrade <neandrad
      AT ieng9.ucsd.edu> who helped figuring that out.

0.51.2 [unstable branch] Fri Oct 29 2004, joern
    Notes:
    - If you want to use transcode 0.6.13, you need this
      dvd::rip release. Older releases doesn't work.
    - Unfortunately transcode 0.6.13 has a bug which
      affects most operations of dvd::rip. You need
      to recompile transcode with a tiny patch, which
      is contained in dvd::rip's tarball:

      patches/transcode-0.6.13-bitstream.patch

    Features:
    - Deinterlace preset 'smartdeinter' now uses transcode's
      smartyuv filter instead of smartdeinter. It's much faster,
      assembly optimized and works in YUV colorspace.
    - Bojan Bozeovic added a Serbian translation.

    transcode 0.6.13 compatability:
    - Previews were flipped and wrongly colored. Thanks for
      the patch to Robin Hill <robin AT robinhill.me.uk>.
    - transcode's colorspace default setting changed from
      RGB to YUV, this required according changes in dvd::rip.

0.51.1 [unstable branch] Sun Oct 10 2004, joern
    Notes:
    - A new dependency: the Perl module Locale::TextDomain,
      often packaged as libintl-perl resp. libintl-xs-perl
      in many distribtions.

    Bugfixes:
    - Merging multiple PSU's with OGG/Vorbis in cluster mode
      didn't work. Thanks for the reports to Daniel Baughman
      <danrb AT codenet.net>, Sybren <sybren AT thirdtower.com>
      and Henning <einpfundhirn AT web.de>.
    - backup.rip creation failed if project's tmp/ directory
      was missing. Thanks for the report to Felix Knecht.
    - Gray out RIP button in DVD Image and DVD on-the-fly modes,
      because makes no sense here. Thanks for the report to
      Geoffrey Trexler <skynet AT charter.net>
    - dvdrip --help didn't work with recent Perl versions

    Features:
    - Full localization support (l10n). A lot of work for
      this was done by Oliver Kramer, who translated dvd::rip
      to German and send me a patch, which turned dvd::rip
      into a German version. I used this patch to extract
      all messages from dvd::rip source code and converted
      it to a patch, which added gettext() like calls, instead
      of a hardcoded German translation. Read l10n/README
      if you're interested in maintaining translations
      and contact me.
    - Translations and their maintainers in this release:
        Czech:    Ales Tosovsky <tosovsky AT wo.cz>
        French:   Sebastien Corot <scorot AT libertysurf.fr>
	German:   Jörn Reder <joern AT zyn.de>
        Spanish:  Sergio Cambra <runico AT users.berlios.de>
      The file l10/MAINTAINERS will always list all
      actual translation maintainers.
    - Support for Vorbis quality of -1, suggested by
      Bennett Perkins <bennett.perkins AT optusnet.com.au>.

0.50.18 [stable branch] Sun Apr 18 2004, joern
    Bugfixes:
    - ac3 passthrough was broken. Thanks for reporting
      to James Broberg <jbrobergAT cs.rmit.edu.au> and
      TOSOVSKY Ales <tosovsky AT znalecka.cz>

0.50.17 [stable branch] Sat Apr 10 2004, joern
    Features:
    - support for another transcode deinterlacer (I=5),
      suggested by Jean-Yves Simon <lethalwp AT tiscali.be>

    Bugfixes:
    - mp3 samplerate setting didn't work, only 48khz
      for CVD. Thanks for the report to Neverstopdreaming
      <neverstopdreaming AT tiscali.it>.
    - dvd::rip couldn't open empty project files
    - prevent timeouts when encoding Ogg/Vorbis in cluster mode
    - vobsub creation now splits with millisecond precision,
      thanks for the patch to Jean-Yves Simon

0.50.16 [stable branch] Sun Oct 26 2003, joern
    Note:
    - If you have Perl 5.8.1 you *need* this release. Older
      versions of dvd::rip do not work with Perl 5.8.1.

    Features:
    - New checkbox "Reuse log" for 2-pass encoding on the
      Transcode tab. Once activated an existent 2-pass
      logfile will be reused resp. pass 1 is skipped. This
      way you can continue a 2-pass transcoding if the 2nd
      pass went wrong for some reason. Long awaited feature
      requested by many users, including myself ;)
    - Workaround for transcode filters which declare options
      multiple times (as the unsharp filter in transcode
      0.6.10). Reported by Fabio Russo.

    Bugfixes:
    - Perl 5.8.1 compatability issue fixed. Opening project files
      saved with a Perl 5.8.1 dvd::rip didn't work.
    - Transcode diskspace calculation was wrong in chapter mode.
    - cdrecord-clone (Debian unstable) is detected correctly now.
      Thanks for the report to Ben Handley <ben AT steelgarden.com>
      and Christian Marillat <marillat AT free.fr>.
    - XVCD multiplexing didn't work for higher video bitrates.
      Reported by <dvdrip AT vikas.mailshell.com>.
    - Deinterlacing settings 'smart' and 'inverse telecine' didn't
      restore correctly after saving/reopening. Reported by
      xavier <list.dvdrip-users AT natch.dyndns.org> and
      Jean-Yves Simon <lethalwp AT tiscali.be>.
    - If the transcode installation lacks filters, which are still
      referred in the project file, these referrals are removed to
      prevent dvd::rip from later crashing. Reported by <jawashin
      AT uiuc.edu>.
    - Video bitrate 'manual' setting wasn't deactivated when
      switching from X(S)VCD to (S)VCD.
    - Cluster control window: when removing a project the first
      project was selected internally but not on the GUI. Reported
      by Mark Rose <shifted AT shifted.ca>.
    - Ripping and snapshot grabbing failed if the title had no
      audio at all. Reported by Sean Dwyer <ewe2 AT can.org.au>.
    - dvd::rip hung if a autoadjust preset was applied on a
      completely black frame.

0.50.15 [stable branch] Sun Aug 24 2003, joern
    Features:
    - Expanded the subtitle selection popup to the maximum of
      32 entries, not only the probed entries. With some DVD's the
      subtitle probing fails. This way you can select even
      "impossible" subtitles, if they weren't detected correctly.
      Thanks for the suggestion to Stefan Raspl <stefan.raspl AT
      playofmind.net>.
    - Blank CD-RW (uses the configured cdrecord command and device),
      supporting 'fast' and 'all' methods (choose in the preferences).
      Not really tested yet due to lack of CD-RW media. Suggested
      by <dvdrip AT vikas.mailshell.com>.
    - New preference "Preferred language". Default audio track
      and subtitle are selected accordingly after reading TOC,
      resp. the first audio track / subtitle matching the
      preferred language will be selected. Note that you still
      should review this setting, because the first matching item
      found must not be the one you really want. Suggested by
      John Washington <washingtonj AT acm.org>. Credits for the
      list of available language codes go to Chris Phillips 
      <acid_kewpie AT users.sourceforge.net>, the author of lsdvd,
      from which I extracted the list.
    - Video codec list takes the new XviD variants of transcode 0.6.9
      into account (xvid, xvid2, xvid3 and xvid4). For earlier
      transcode versions still xvid and xvidcvs are listed here.
    - Support for xvid4conf, a tool to tweak all options of the
      new dev-api-4 XviD codec. You need at least transcode 0.6.9
      and xvid4conf 1.6 for this to work.
      Note: the xvid4 settings will be used for all titles of your
      project. Also they don't take effect in cluster mode. This will
      change for future dvd::rip/transcode releases.

    New/Changed X?S?VCD|CVD stuff:
    ==============================
    - Renamed '(S)VCD' container format to 'MPEG', which is in fact
      what it is.
    - Added new MPEG "Codecs": XSVCD, XVCD and CVD
      - SVCD and VCD create standard conform streams. You
	can't change parameters to non-standard values.
      - XSVCD and XVCD allow you to choose arbitrary video and
	audio bitrates / samplerates.
      - CVD allows you everything (like X(S)VCD), but additionally
	dvd::rip checks for correct frame sizes.
    - Added new Clip & Zoom presets: CVD anamorph and XSVCD
      anamorph for PAL and NTSC.
    - Added new Preference: "Default Container Format", fixing also
      a mismatch, if you choosed 'SVCD' or 'VCD' as a default codec,
      but dvd::rip still set to 'avi' container format by default.
    - Audio bitrate 224 was missing in the popup list.
    - Renamed 'Target format' to 'Select container' and the 'Video
      codec' label got renamed to 'MPEG variant' for the MPEG
      container"

    Thanks to James L. Paul who urged me to implement the CVD
    stuff, which hopefully introduced not too many bugs ;)

    Bugfixes:
    - mplayer DVD player command didn't work for LPCM tracks.
      Thanks to Fabio Russo for the patch. You must re-select
      the mplayer command from the Preferences page for this to
      take effect.
    - Free diskspace warning wasn't exact. Thanks for the patch
      to Moritz Muehlenhoff <jmm AT informatik.uni-bremen.de>.
    - Fixed a typo in the --avilimit option (for AVI files >2GB).
      Thanks for the report to Jarkko Seppa <Jarkko.Seppa AT oulu.fi>.
    - Default target size was set to 1406, instead of 1400 (2x700).

0.50.14 [stable branch] Sun 29 Jun 2003, joern
    Features:
    - transcode >= 0.6.6 sets mpeg2enc -I 0 by default, but
      older versions doesn't. This speeds up things signifcantly,
      because now mpeg2enc skips deinterlace processing (it was
      done even for non-interlaced material and wasted time).
      dvd::rip now sets -I0, too. Thanks for the hint to
      Simone Lehmann
    - Warn about AVI files >2GB and set transcode option
      --avi_limit 9999, otherwise transcode splits automatically
      at 2GB.

    Bugfixes:
    - NTSC A/V sync enhancement: dvd::rip's -x vob,null transcode
      option in the 1st pass of a multipass transcoding was 
      good for performance, but could be bad for A/V sync with
      some NTSC material, because the audio information is always
      needed for proper synchronisation. Thanks to Florin and
      Tilmann for figuring this out.
    - NTSC: -M2 isn't set anymore by dvd::rip, because transcode
      does autodetect this. Thanks to Tilmann for the hint.
    - Fixed a small mismatch (about 1%) in the audio size
      calculation, which affected video bitrate calculation.
      Thanks for the report to Charles François Rey
      <charlesfr.rey AT epfl.ch>.
    - Automatic setting of PERLIO=stdio failed, if PERLIO
      was already set to some value. Thanks for the report to
      Richard Kilgore <rkilgore AT hotpop.com>.
    - Progress bar was messed up with PSU core. Thanks for the
      report to Tyler <dvdrip AT unixgod.net> and Florin.
    - NTSC: resolution was set to 720x480, even if the movie
      had 704x480. dvd::rip now sets no resolution at all, because
      transcode autodetects the resolution. Thanks for the report to
      Francisco J. León <fleona AT cantv.net>.

0.50.13 [stable branch] Thu 23 May 2003, joern
    Features:
    - New deinterlace preset: inverse telecine (for NTSC).
      Suggested by Andrew Ukrainec <ukrainec AT sympatico.ca>
      and Thanasis Tsiodras <ttsiod AT softlab.ece.ntua.gr>.
    - Added dvdxchap dependency (which is part of ogmtools),
      because you get proper chapter progress bars only
      if dvdxchap is installed.

    Bugfixes:
    - Removed a small copy protection related function. You
      can read details about why this happened on
      http://www.exit1.org/dvdrip/ news entry 2003/05/23.
    - Default disc size for a new project was still 703 MB
      (instead of 700). Also the Zoom Calculator showed
      703 MB in the disc size popup. Thanks for the report
      to Fridtjof Busse.
    - Audio bitrate combo box popdown button was sensitive
      for VCD, although VCD has a fixed rate of 224. Reported
      by Andreas Volz <andreas AT brachttal.net>.
    - Sometimes the chapter progress bar was messed up, if no
      dvdxchap is installed on the system (which is part of
      ogmtools).

0.50.12 [stable branch] Thu 1 May 2003, joern
    Features:
    - Yet another useless feature ;) You can start the
      dvdrip-master cluster control daemon with the -w
      option to fire up a webserver (listening on port 8888
      by default, can be changed with -W) which delivers
      the cluster status as HTML. Based on an inspiriation
      by Fabio Russo. Maybe somewhat senseless but much fun
      to implement ;)

    Bugfixes:
    - Removed the LD_ASSUME_KERNEL workaround for RedHat 9.
      At least on gentoo dvd::rip didn't start anymore. So
      all RH9 users, which suffer from the transcode/NPTL
      problem, need to set LD_ASSUME_KERNEL=2.2.5 on their own
      before starting dvd::rip. Thanks a lot to Fridtjof Busse
      who helped me debugging this issue.
    - When no title is selected all notebook pages with title
      specific settings are disabled now. Some entries threw
      exceptions if you enter them with no titles selected.
      Thanks for the report to Fabio Russo.
    - Prefefined mplayer command played all chapters from the
      selected chapter on. Now it plays only the one selected
      chapter. Thanks for the report to Fabio Russo.

0.50.11 [stable branch] Sat 26 Apr 2003, joern
    Note:
    - To all RedHat 9 Users: RedHat's default kernel uses
      the new Native Posix Thread Library, which makes problems
      with transcode. Setting the environment variable
      LD_ASSUME_KERNEL=2.2.5 may workaround this problem (also
      installing all RedHat errata). dvd::rip now sets
      LD_ASSUME_KERNEL, just to prevent "yet another FAQ" ;)
      There are reports, that it doesn't work even with this
      variable set. Please keep an eye on the transcode-users
      list, if you suffer from this problem. I can't help you - 
      don't use RedHat ;)

    Bugfixes:
    - dvdrip -v reported nothing, in particular not the version
      number ;)
    - Movies with no audio track within the first few MB of the
      stream made strange problems. Added -H 10 to the
      correspondent transcode commands, which extends the
      area of audio probing, so this shouldn't happen anymore.
      Thanks for the hint to Tillmann Bitterberg.
    - Changed 703 MB cd preset to 700 MB. 703 was too tight.
      Also added the "-overburn" option to the cdrecord command.
    - Workaround for a transcode bug: for NTSC movies the frame
      rate sometimes isn't detected propery from DVD. Only
      probing the VOB's after ripping reports always the correct
      frame rate. Thanks for the report to Douglas Bollinger.
    - Progress bar was messed up when transcoding with PSU Core.
      Thanks for the report to Douglas Bollinger.
    - Cluster mode: the dr_exec program (part of dvd::rip) was
      needed on remote nodes, although no dvd::rip software is
      installed on them. This is fixed now, no dr_exec necessary
      anymore on remote nodes. Thanks for the report to Lethal
      Weapon.
    - Reduced OGG overhead value for video bitrate calculation.
      from 1.15% to 0.25% of total stream size, which is an
      estimation based on several test rips I made (using xvid,
      which has obviously the best vbr control from all existent
      mpeg4 codecs). With this value most of my test rip's hit
      the target size with a maximum error of 1 MB.

0.50.10 [stable branch] Tue 1 Apr 2003, joern
    Features:
    - If you re-read the TOC you get a warning, that this will
      override all settings of the current project.
    - A warning message appears, if you add a project with frame
      range setting to the cluster, because always the full movie
      is transcoded in cluster mode.

    Bugfixes:
    - GUI doesn't block anymore on first DVD access when reading
      TOC. Also the complete tcprobe output is printed, if
      something went wrong, which helps solving transcode related
      problems.
    - Extended preferences check of the cdrecord device, which
      also may be a device file on Linux 2.5 systems, since
      IDE burning support is native here. Thanks for the hint
      to Moritz Muehlenhoff <jmm AT informatik.uni-bremen.de>.
    - Transcoding a frame range in chapter mode didn't
      show correct progress information. Reported by Ole Tange.
    - Viewing a subtitle test transcode movie in chapter
      mode didn't work.
    - A video avi file was generated during the first pass with
      ogg quality proccessing. Thanks for the report to Jonathan
      Rogers.

0.50.9 [stable branch] Fri 28 Mar 2003, joern
    Features:
    - Dropped cluster mode restriction for OGG projects
      with more than one PSU. Thanks for the patch to
      Jonathan Rogers <jonner AT mailandnews.com>.
      Now dvd::rip needs ogmtools >= 0.972.

    Bugfixes:
    - Fixed another division by zero condition in the
      Clip & Zoom module. Thanks for the report to
      Mike Oosten <shaggy AT slavery.cx>.
    - Burning page was disabled if only one of the four burning
      related tools (mkisofs, cdrecord, vcdimager, cdrdao)
      was missing, although you e.g. don't need mkisofs for VCD
      burning and no cdrdao for CDROM burning. Now dvd::rip
      is more specific here und disables only the corresponding
      burning types.
    - Adjusted xine DVD player preference for actual versions
      of xine. Thanks for the hint to Fridtjof Busse.
    - Additional transcode options entry didn't work (most
      probably since 0.50.4). Thanks to James L. Paul <james AT
      mauibay.net>
    - Vorbis quality mode didn't work in cluster mode. Thanks
      for the fix to Jonathan Rogers.
    - Lock audio selection popup, during a volume rescale
      scan. Otherwise the scanned value would be assigned to the
      latest selected channel, which may be wrong. Reported
      by Felix Knecht.

0.50.8 [stable branch] Thu 6 Mar 2003, joern
    Bugfixes:
    - Cluster mode: dvdrip-master daemon bailed out with an
      error message on startup. Thanks for the report to
      David Chan <davidchan AT rcn.com>.
    - Cluster mode: if file cleanup was requested and file
      splitting not necessary (because the file is smaller
      than one disc) the transcoded file was removed.

0.50.7 [stable branch] Tue 4 Mar 2003, joern
    Bugfixes:
    - Encoding multiple audio tracks with OGG and PSU core
      enabled didn't work. Thanks for the report to Daniel Egger
      <degger AT fhm.edu>.
    - Revoked the mplex change from version 0.50.4, because
      several users reported problems with it.

0.50.6 [stable branch] Mon 3 Mar 2003, joern
    Bugfixes:
    - Fixed an evil bug, which overwrote the preferences file
      on each startup. Sorry for the inconvenience. I also lost
      my preferences due to it... Thanks for the report to
      Matthias Saou <matthias AT rpmforge.net>.

0.50.5 [stable branch] Mon 3 Mar 2003, joern
    Features:
    - You can pass the preferences filename with the new command
      line option -p to have multiple configurations (default
      is still ~/.dvdriprc). Suggested by Harald Dunkel.
    - Log last output of aborted job's. Suggested by Felix Enning
      <felix AT hfsclub.de>.
    - Don't split the movie, if it fits already on one disc.
      Suggested by Nicos Panayides <anarxia AT gmx.net>.
    - subtitle language ID is now patched into the vobsub .idx
      file, requested by Douglas Bollinger.

    Bugfixes:
    - Video bitrate entry was not greyed out for VCD. Other
      bitrates than the standard value of 1152 are not supported.
    - Creating splitted vobsub's was broken. Thanks for their
      reports to Lutz Birkhahn <lutz.birkhahn AT gmx.de> and
      Douglas Bollinger.
    - transcode's version number was missing in .dvdrip-info file.

0.50.4 [stable branch] Sun 24 Feb 2003, joern
    Features:
    - Minor layout improvements. GUI should now look better with
      different sized fonts.
    - I removed the ps command dependency - found a completely
      different and more flexible solution, which doesn't depend
      on external tools. A new helper program called dr_exec
      is used to print the main PID of the current job, which is
      needed for cancellation.

    Bugfixes:
    - Wrong options were passed to transcode for Vorbis quality
      encoding. Thanks for the report to Brian Healy <brianhealy
      AT vodafone.ie>.
    - mplex SVCD command used wrong profile for SVCD. Thanks for
      the report to Davros <tashuu AT newsguy.com>.
    - Using the smart deinterlacer switched off YUV processing,
      which isn't necessary for transcode >= 0.6.3 anymore. Thanks
      for the report to Mark Dirix.

0.50.3 [stable branch] Mon 17 Feb 2003, joern
    Bugfixes:
    - Dropped the pstree dependend stuff completely. Now ps
      is used, using Posix conform options only, so this should
      work on most systems without problems.
    - Thanks to Ron Smits, who reported a problem with a few
      zombie processes per dvd::rip session on a Slackware system.
      After about an hour of IRC chatting we found a solution
      for it ;)

0.50.2 [stable branch] Sat 15 Feb 2003, joern
    Features:
    - Some layout optimizations: squeezed the GUI again a bit
      and the preview images are now slightly bigger.

    Bugfixes:
    - Fixed a typo in SVCD transcode command. Reported by
      several users.
    - Cancellation of some tasks left processes over. Changed
      back to old cancellation method, which depends on
      pstree, so this is now listed "mandatory" in the dependency
      window. Reported by Fridtjof Busse <fridtjof AT fbunet.de>.
    - Depend check didn't check for absolute path of
      /usr/sbin/fping. Also reported by Fridtjof Busse.
    - Cancellation of a vobsub PS1 extraction left files over,
      so further vobsub PS1 extraction didn't work. Thanks for
      the report to Gregorio Guidi <g.guidi AT sns.it>.
    - Changed two internal Perl namespaces, which confused the
      CPAN/PAUSE Perl module indexer.

0.50.1 [stable branch] Tue 11 Feb 2003, joern
    Bugfixes:
    - NTSC VCD film encoding (at 23.976) didn't work. Thanks for
      the report to Chris Elston <celston AT corky.sapien.net>.
    - dvd::rip's main window was too tall for standard desktops
      with 1024x768 resolution. I could save some space within
      the "Calculated storage" frame to fix this. On my system the
      window has now 657x696 pixels, which should be Ok for
      1024x768 desktops. Thanks for the report to Florin.
    - Subtitle selection wasn't activated, even if subtitle2pgm
      was detected correctly.

0.50.0 [stable branch] Mon 10 Feb 2003, joern
    Notes:
    - This is a new stable release, closing the 0.49.x unstable
      branch.
    - Project file format changed since 0.48.x. Older files are
      converted automatically, but you can't use files saved with
      this release with older dvd::rip versions.
    - You should use at least transcode 0.6.3 to get all new features,
      but transcode 0.6.2 is still supported.
    - To get full and bugfree support for the new Filter & Preview
      feature, read the entry of 0.49.11 and apply the patch mentioned
      there, unless you have transcode > 0.6.3 (which doesn't exist
      as of this writing).
    - From now on dvd::rip insists on Perl >= 5.6.0.
    - For a full list of changes and bugfixes, refer to the 0.49.x
      change log entries below. Features and bugfixes listed next
      are changes to 0.49.13.

    Features:
    - New button "Check all settings" in Preference dialog.
      Suggested by Ole Tange.

    Bugfixes:
    - Dependencies listed ogmtools with minimum 0.954, but correct
      is 0.960 (mp3/ac3 only works since this version).
    - Dependency check didn't consider maximum rar version (must be
      a 2.x version, no 3.x).
    - Filter removal didn't affect an opened preview window.
    - Negative values in the cropping entries were rejected. Thanks
      for the report to Mauro Spluga <ferluga AT inwind.it>

0.49.13 [unstable branch] Sat 08 Feb 2003, joern
    Features:
    - A more sophisticated dependency check. A new window (menu item
      "Debug/Check dependencies") lists all needed tools with
      minimum, suggested and installed version numbers. On startup
      dvd::rip opens this window with a corresponding error message,
      if a mandatory tool is missing. Optional modules are disabled,
      if the correspondent tool isn't installed (affects subtitles,
      (S)VCD, OGG/Vorbis and CD burning).
    - Filter & preview: an activated subtitle rendering (from the
      Subtitle page) is passed through, so this is a better option to
      test your subtitle settings - compared to the slow test
      transcoding facility on the Subtitle page.
    - PSU core is enabled by default only for NTSC movies which
      have more than one PSU. Thanks for this suggestion to Florin.
    - Full volume scanning support in chapter mode. A patch from
      Kianusch Sayah Karadji.

    Bugfixes:
    - Filter preview: transcode has to be started with -u 1,
      otherwise pause/undo jumps between different frames. Thanks
      to Tilmann for the hint.
    - Enabled nice for all cluster jobs (was enabled only for video
      transcoding). Reported by Michael Dratz <midra AT web.de>.
    - A uncaught exception was thrown, if dvd::rip couldn't connect
      to a remote cluster master daemon. Reported by Fabio Russo.

0.49.12 [unstable branch] Thu 06 Feb 2003, joern
    Bugfixes:
    - Reading TOC threw an exception, reported by Tilmann.
    - Opening a filter preview frame with a freshly ripped
      title segfaulted transcode, because the preview buffer
      size was empty. Now it's 20 by default.
    - Stopping a paused preview window didn't close the window.

0.49.11 [unstable branch] Thu 06 Feb 2003, joern
    Note:
    - Filter & Preview enabled only for transcode >= 0.6.3 stable.

    Features:
    - Added a warning message about non-standard (S)VCD frame sizes.
    - SVCD video framerate is now limited to a maximum of 2600
      (overall bitrate as supplied before is limited to 2748).
    - Added Open/Close DVD/Burner tray buttons on Title and Burn pages.
      Based on a patch from Kianusch Sayah Karadji <kianusch AT
      sk-tech.net>. You need to configure your "burner device" in the
      Preferences and must have the 'eject' command installed on your
      system.
    - Special support for logo, logoaway and mask filters: you
      can select a rectangular area on the preview window and
      the corresponding position / size values are automatically
      filled into the entries on the GUI. For PRE filters (currently
      mask only), the coordinates are transformed correctly - needed
      because the preview window shows the POST result, while the
      filter expects PRE coordinates (prior clipping and resizing).
      Also in YUV mode dvd::rip takes care, that the values are even.
    - File selection dialog for filename filter options.
    - YUV is automatically disabled, if you have a filter which
      supports RGB only (indeed, currently all transcode filters
      support YUV) or if you crop or resize with odd values.
      So now there is no need for the "YUV internal" checkbox to
      come back.
    - Filter preview loops, if end of the movie or frame range
      is reached.
    - Applying filters in pause mode enabled again - also the "Undo"
      button is back. You need transcode 0.6.3 with this patch
      from Tilmann: (to be applied on vanilla 0.6.3)
      http://www.exit1.org/dvdrip/dist/patches/tc-0.6.3-preview-pause.patch
	    % cd transcode-0.6.3
	    % patch -p1 < tc-0.6.3-preview-pause.patch
    - Multiple instances of the same filter are now fully supported.

    Bugfixes:
    - VCD Clip&Zoom presets didn't produce correct aspect ratio.
      Thanks for the hint to Simone Lehmann <simone AT lisanet.de>.
    - Quotes in the project name resp. project paths confuse
      dvd::rip. The path fields on the storage page now reject
      a bunch of special characters, as a first bugfix. Thanks for
      the report to Spencer Ogden <spencero AT mail.utexas.edu>.
    - Added mpeg2enc options "-I 0 -p" for NTSC 23.976 fps movies,
      because otherwise A/V sync is messy. Thanks for the hint
      to Andrew Ukrainec <ukrainec AT sympatico.ca>.
    - Closing the "Configure filter" window when a preview
      window was playing, didn't close the preview window
      also.
    - PSU core disabled for filter preview, because the generated
      transcode command doesn't work with it. Thanks for the
      report to Douglas Bollinger.
    - GUI for filters with no options (e.g. dilyuvmmx) was messed up.
    - Changing some filter frame range options didn't work.
    - Some legal fractional values were rejected by dvd::rip's
      value check module.
    - Fixed a typo on the burning page. Thanks to Yves Duret
      <yves AT zarb.org>.

0.49.10 [unstable branch] Tue 28 Jan 2003, joern
    Features:
    - transcode filter description cache is automatically
      refreshed not only when transcode was updated, but
      also when the corresponding dvd::rip module changed.

    Bugfixes:
    - A broken .dvdriprc file could crash dvd::rip with a
      confusing error message. Now a better error message
      is printed, which suggests to remove the broken file.
    - Filter & Preview:
      - Options of 'logo' filter were not recognized correctly.
	Reported by Tilmann.
      - Adding 'logoaway' filter threw an exception. In general
	some filters with checkbox options didn't work correctly.
	Also reported by Tilmann.
      - Parameter passing for filter options with multiple values
	didn't work.
      - Broken filter default setting parser removed. Now
	String::Scanf is used, which is copied into dvd::rip's
	library tree, to keep the dependencies low.
      - transcode currently doesn't support reliably to apply filter
	changes in paused mode, so this isn't possible on the GUI
	anymore. The "Undo" button became useless due to that, so it
	was also removed. Now everything that's possible, should
	work as expected ;)
      - Closing the preview window now works and stops the
	corresponding transcode process cleanly.
	Note: you need to patch your transcode for that. Download
        http://www.exit1.org/dvdrip/dist/patches/tc-20030123-preview-close.patch
	(from Tilmann) and and apply it with
	    % cd transcode-0.6.3-20030123
	    % patch -p1 < tc-20030123-preview-close.patch
	Any newer snapshot as 0.6.3-20030123 should have that
	patch included, soon. Older unpatched versions show the
	same erroneous behaviour - so don't close the preview
	window with them and use the 'O' button instead.

0.49.9 [unstable branch] Mon 27 Jan 2003, joern
    Features:
    - A new experimental dialog "Configure filters". All filters
      supported by transcode's new socket interface are available
      here for configuration. You need at least transcode 0.6.3.20030123
      for it. But it's not only a comprehensive configuration
      dialog - you have a live preview window and can check your
      changes in realtime WYSIWYG - it's really cool, guys. Thanks
      to Tilmann, who implemented the transcode part and send me
      patches immediately after my bug reports ;) Currently there
      is no documentation, hopefully the GUI is somewhat self-
      explanatory. Nevertheless: a short quick start guide:
      - click "Configure filters & preview" on the transcode page
      - double click on the "invert" filter in the left filter list
      - click on the ">" (Play) Button
      - a preview window opens, showing the movie inverted
      - disable the "Enable filter" checkbox
      - click on "A" (Apply) - the movie immediately gets
	normal again
      - any filter setting changes can be applied in realtime
	by clicking on the "A" button at any time.
      - click on the "||" (Pause) button
      - now you can navigate through transcode's internal preview
	buffer (you can modify the size of this buffer with the
	first entry in the "Preview settings" frame). "<<" and ">>"
	navigate by frame, "<<<" and ">>>" usually by 5 frames
	(resp. higher values for higher buffer sizes). You get green
	frames, if you access parts of the buffer, which aren't
	filled yet.
      - in pause mode:
	- change a filter setting
	- click on "A" (Apply)
	- the current picture is rendered with the new setting
	- now click on "U" (Undo)
	- the picture before you applied the last time is restored.
	  This way you easily can compare two filter settings.
	- (see note about this in the "Known bugs" section beyond).
      - the preview window runs with maximum speed. You can slow
	done resp. speed up again using the "-" and "+" buttons.
      - click on "O" (Stop) to close the preview window
    - Dropped "Antialias" setting on transcode page. It's seldom
      used and you still can enable it using the new filters
      dialog (videocore filter, -C option).
    - Progress information for chapter ripping. dvd::rip uses
      dvdxchap, which is part of ogmtools, to get the chapter
      lengths. If you don't have ogmtools installed, dvd::rip
      falls back to the old bevhaviour showing no ripping progress
      for chapters.

    Known bugs:
    - For some reasons the pp filter doesn't work with the
      filter configuration dialog. Have to debug this.
    - Just closing the preview window doesn't really stop the
      process, you anyway must hit the stop button. Sometimes
      you even must kill transcode processes by hand, if you
      closed the preview window. Have to discuss this with Tilmann.
    - Multiple applying and undoing settings on a paused frame is
      cumulative. Also a subject of discussion with Tilmann ;)
    - transcode supports adding some filters multiple times. Due
      to a bug in transcode (or in dvd::rip - not figured out finally)
      this doesn't work with transcode 0.6.3.20030123, so it's
      disabled on dvd::rip's GUI until it works.

    Bugfixes:
    - Reduce disc size passed to avisplit/ogmsplit to decrease
      the risk of a oversized file. Thanks to Felix Knecht
      <felixknecht AT web.de> and Julio Sánchez for report and
      discussion.
    - Adding (S)VCD projects to cluster using the menu entry
      isn't possible anymore - (S)VCD is not supported by 
      cluster mode. The corresponding button was disabled, but
      the menu entry not.
    - Remove trailing whitespace from path's on the storage page.
      This makes pasting from an xterm easier, if the buffer
      contains a trailing newline. Requested by Tilmann Bitterberg.
    - Subtitle preview grabbing threw an exception.

0.49.8 [unstable branch] Mon 13 Jan 2003, joern
    Bugfixes:
    - Frame range "end" entry didn't work anymore. Christoph's
      frame range patch of 0.49.7 was correct, but I applied an
      erroneous "optimization" ;)
    - Fixed a typo: preset "SVCD 16:9 anamorph, PAL" actually is
      "SVCD anamorph, PAL".

0.49.7 [unstable branch] Mon 13 Jan 2003, joern
    Notes:
    - From now on dvd::rip insists on Perl >= 5.6.0. Older
      versions don't provide the syntactic sugar I like.
    - Added a COPYRIGHT file, with references to all developers
      who contributed patches and share the copyright.

    Features:
    - Multiple audio track support for SVCD (you get a warning
      if you select more than two tracks, because this isn't
      standard conform).
    - A new checkbox "Use range" on the Transcode page enables
      considerung a given frame range for video bitrate
      calculation. This was implemented by Christoph Bartoschek
      <bartoschek AT gmx.de>.
    - Single instance windows now pop up into foreground if
      opened again. A patch from Matthias Riese.
    - DVD TOC occupies now all space available. Again a patch
      from Matthias Riese.
    - Burn page filename list occupies now all space available.
      Yet another a patch from Matthias Riese ;)

    Bugfixes:
    - Removed any conditional code for transcode versions < 0.6.2.
      This fixed also a missing "--print_status 20" transcode
      parameter, which increased video transcoding load
      unnecessarily. Thanks for the report to Vlad Spichek
      <spy AT mbox.ath.cx>.
    - According to a hint from Julio Sánchez mpeg2enc's -S
      parameter is set to 10000 for non-splitting operation,
      because mpeg2enc splits by default at 700 MB.
    - smartdeinter setting wasn't restored after opening a
      project file. Reported by Christian Lambert.
    - Adjusted smartdeinter settings according to a suggestion
      of Christian Lambert:
      -J smartdeinter=threshold=10:Blend=1:diffmode=2:highq=1
    - Frame range: entering illegal ranges (start > end) is
      prevented now. Thanks for the report to Christoph Bartoschek.
    - Most 'focus-out' handlers are 'changed' handlers again.
      Transfering changes to the internal object data structure on
      focus-out is confusing resp. sometimes user has to click
      somewhere to trigger it explicitly. Reported by Florin Andrei.
    - Burning tab: some unusal named (S)VCD image files weren't
      recognized correctly.
    - Preferences: ffmpeg4 preset became ffmpeg. Setting 'ffmpeg'
      from preferences didn't set af6/ffmpeg codec to 'mpeg4'
      automatically. Reported by Christian Lambert.
    - Added fail safe code for a possible "illegal by division by
      zero" condition in bitrate calculator. Reported by Christoph
      Bartoschek.
    - "View AVI" was too fuzzy regarding filename globbing (.mpg
      files were included). Reported by Markus Dewerny.

0.49.6 [unstable branch] Tue 7 Jan 2003, joern
    Features:
    - WAV creation command now printed in the debugging window.

    Bugfixes:
    - WAV creation resulted in white noise for lpcm tracks.
      Thanks for the report to Damien Covey <djcovey AT
      softhome.net>.
    - WAV creation didn't worked for Chapter mode. Also reported
      by Damien Covey.

0.49.5 [unstable branch] Mon 6 Jan 2003, joern
    Features:
    - rar command (for vobsub compression) is now configurable.
      Suggested by Mikkel Mondrup Kristensen <mikkel AT tdx.dk>.

    Bugfixes:
    - CD size wasn't set in (S)VCD transcode command. Reported
      by Markus Dewerny <dewerny AT web.de> and Dirk Aust
      <dirk_aust AT gmx.de>.
    - Clip & Zoom: width and height of zoom/clip2 stages didn't
      update correctly if no zoom was set. Thanks for the report
      to Joakim Verona <joakim AT verona.se>.

0.49.4 [unstable branch] Wed 1 Jan 2003, joern
    Features:
    - WAV generation of the selected audio track. You find a
      correspondent entry in the "Operate" menu. The file is
      created in the project's avi/ directory. Requested by
      Thibaut Cousin <cousin AT in2p3.fr> and Marc Dirix
      <dirixmjm AT home.nl>. Thanks to Tillmann Bitterberg
      <transcode AT tibit.org>, who posted the shortest transcode
      command for this ;)
    - Percentage log messages of previous dvd::rip versions are
      back again (disappeared accidentally some versions ago).
      Requested by Fred Beondo <bl8206 AT mindspring.com>.

    Bugfixes:
    - Fixed a typo on the transcode tab. Thanks to Jochen Puchalla
      <mail AT puchalla-online.de>.
    - Spaces in directories / filenames (project base directory,
      vob/avi/tmp etc.) are not allowed, because they make problems
      with transcode and other tools. Thanks to David Legg
      <david_legg AT tiscali.co.uk>.
    - Changing the project name resp. project path after reading TOC
      isn't possible anymore, because this confuses dvd::rp, which
      can't find the files anymore. Thanks to Fabio Russo.
    - Closing a new project after reading TOC didn't open a save
      file dialog (because after TOC reading the project is saved
      to tmp/backup.rip already).
    - Cluster mode: dvdrip-master ignored configured nodes as long
      as no project ever was added to the cluster. Thanks for some
      hard investigation work to Wolfgang Schricker <wols AT wols.org>.
    - Added a fail safe check in file conversion.

0.49.3 [unstable branch] Sun 29 Dec 2002, joern
    Bugfixes:
    - File conversion didn't work for all older files, due to a bug
      in the version comparison routine.

0.49.2 [unstable branch] Sun 29 Dec 2002, joern
    Notes:
    - File format changed and isn't backward compatible. Old project
      files are autoconverted, but older dvd::rip versions can't open
      files saved with this version.
    - dvd::rip insists on transcode 0.6.2 from now on.

    Features:
    - Major internal code cleanup, hopefully without introducing too
      many bugs.
    - Added OGG/Vorbis video bitrate optimization. First all audio
      tracks are transcoded, after that the real audio size is known
      so the video bitrate can be adjusted accordingly. Correspondent
      messages appear in the log. This works in standard and cluster
      mode. Thanks to Moritz Bunkus, Markus Liebl and xercist for
      suggestions and discussion.
    - PCM passthrough (for AVI only). Requested long time ago by
      Jamie Manley <jamie AT homebrewcomputing.com> and xercist.
    - Support for transcode's smartdeinter deinterlacing filter. This
      switches off YUV mode, because this filter supports only RGB
      (it's rather slow but has good quality). Requested by Christian
      Lambert, Florin Andrei and others.
    - Slightly cluster mode optimization: master node's state is never
      'offline' or 'unknown', and the node isn't fping'ed anymore.

    Bugfixes:
    - Adjusted (S)VCD bitrate overhead calculation (mpeg2enc's -B
      parameter) to audio + 2% of overall stream (was 1%), because
      1% seems to be underestimated in general.
    - (S)VCD disc size calculation didn't consider the per disc
      overhead of 600 sectors. Again thanks to Julio Sánchez.
    - Vorbis sample rate conversion didn't work.
    - transcoding to OGG without audio didn't work. Thanks for the
      report to Clint Silvester <clint AT focuscompanies.com>
    - Volume scanning of PCM audio tracks didn't work.
    - Cluster mode: additional audio tracks with OGG didn't work.

0.49.1 [unstable branch] Fri 27 Dec 2002, joern
    Notes:
    - File format changed and isn't backward compatible. Old project
      files are autoconverted, but older dvd::rip versions can't open
      files saved with this version.

    Bugfixes:
    - All changes from 0.48.0 - 0.48.6 are included in this release
      (refer to the corresponding Changes entries for details)
    - Cluster mode: fixed missing progress information for merge
      jobs. Thanks for the fix to Fabio Russo.

    Features:
    - Applied a patch from Stefan Gmeiner <riddlebox AT freesurf.ch>,
      which adds the ability of estimating the image size before
      burning on the fly, which is needed for some drives (e.g.
      TEAC).
    - Partially applied a patch from Petros Stavrakakis
      <petros AT stavrakakis.de> which brings more detailed options
      for cdrdao, in particular you can select the cdrdao-driver
      and buffersize.
    - On the transcode tab a new setting "Container format" was added,
      currently with three options: AVI, OGG, (S)VCD. This way you
      explicitely decide a container format first, the GUI follows
      this decision and enables/disables all other options accordingly.
      If actual settings can't be done with a selected container
      these will be set to reasonably defaults, with correspondent
      messages in the log.
    - mp3/ac3 audio codecs now supported also for OGG container. You
      need at least ogmtools v0.960 (I tested with v0.970).
    - Preliminary support for vorbis quality based encoding. Future
      versions will determine real audio size after encoding the
      1st pass (when using 2pass transcoding) and will adjust
      video bitrate accordingly for the 2nd pass.
    - Option to change the audio samplerate (be careful with odd
      values here, transcode resp. lame bails out for ununsal
      samplerates - 48000, 44100 and 24000 always worked for me).
      Requested long time ago by Certron DiSoni.
    - A new window "Bitrate calculation details" shows all steps of
      the video bitrate calculation, so you can see exactly what
      happens here. The window can stay open all the time. Its
      calculation sheet follows your settings immediately.
    - Bitrate calculation now considers selected chapters correctly.
    - A new checkbox "manual video bitrate" let you decide explicetly,
      if you want dvd::rip to calculate the video bitrate for you,
      or not. By default, it's disabled and the video bitrate entry
      not sensible. If you enable the "manual" checkbox, dvd::rip
      doesn't touch your setting, even if you change the target size,
      disc count popup etc.
    - Adjusted CD size presets to standard values: 650,703,800,870
      (which are 74, 80, 90, 99 minute CD-R with 2048 bytes sector
      size. 2324 byte sector size for VCD is now considered, see
      below). Thanks to Julio Sánchez <j.sanchezf AT terra.es>.
    - (S)VCD sector sizes are considered for SVCD video bitrate
      calculation, so you can select a CD size from the popup and
      need not to fiddle with SVCD space on your own. This maybe
      somewhat confusing on the one hand (because the resulting size is
      magically bigger than your setting), but on the other hand
      the CD-ROM disc sizes are well-known. And you still can enter
      arbitrary MB values by hand, so I decided to leave the MB based
      size definition (beside a CD-R duration / minute based one).
      Thanks to Julio Sánchez who enlighted several details of the
      (S)VCD specification, which were new to me.
    - Some further SVCD improvements, e.g. min-gop-size and max-gop-size
      values depending on PAL/NTSC are set. Thanks a lot for the
      (S)VCD help to Tom Vijlbrief <tom.vijlbrief AT ision.nl>
    - AVI/OGG/MPEG container overhead is now considered for video
      bitrate calculation. Thanks to Markus Liebl for some tests
      and hints regarding measuring the overhead values, and Moritz
      Bunkus for information about OGG overhead.
    - Dropped the "YUV internally" setting from the GUI, it's always
      enabled.

0.48.8 [stable branch] Mon 06 Jan 2003, joern
    Bugfixes:
    - Clip & Zoom: width and height of zoom/clip2 stages didn't
      update correctly if no zoom was set. Thanks for the report
      to Joakim Verona <joakim AT verona.se>.

0.48.7 [stable branch] Mon 06 Jan 2003, joern
    Bugfixes:
    - CD size wasn't set in (S)VCD transcode command. Reported
      by Markus Dewerny <dewerny AT web.de> and Dirk Aust
      <dirk_aust AT gmx.de>.

0.48.6 [stable branch] Fri 13 Dec 2002, joern
    Bugfixes:
    - Fixed a typo in the vcdimager command (which didn't affect
      proper operation on my system, but it was anyway a typo ;)
      Thanks for report and fix to Tom Vijlbrief <tom.vijlbrief
      AT ision.nl>
    - Using "Create vobsub now" threw an exception due to a missing
      avi directory. Thanks to Eckehardt Luhm <bselu AT web.de>.

0.48.5 [stable branch] Sat 7 Dec 2002, joern
    Bugfix:
    - 0.48.3 introduced a bug which prevents multiple audio
      tracks with OGG/Vorbis. Thanks to Lethal Weapon for
      the report.

0.48.4 [stable branch] Wed 4 Dec 2002, joern
    Bugfix:
    - Fixed a dumb bug, where dvd::rip complained about a missing
      avi directory when transcoding a title the first time.
      Thanks for the report to Florin Andrei (I'm wondering why
      nobody found this bug earlier - it should exist since version
      0.47.5 - anyway, now it's fixed ;)

0.48.3 [stable branch] Tue 3 Dec 2002, joern
    Features:
    - dvd::rip now checks on startup if you're using Perl 5.8
      without having PERLIO=stdio set. If yes, dvd::rip sets
      the variable for you and restarts. (This bug is already
      reported to the Perl developers and hopefully fixed
      soon, so dvd::rip can drop this workaround somedays).

    Bugfixes:
    - Adding additional audio tracks didn't work for DVD image
      and on-the-fly transcoding. Reported by Matthias Hennemann
      <Matthias.Hennemann AT Organik.Uni-Erlangen.DE>
    - Free diskspace wasn't printed before ripping. Reported
      by Florin Andrei.
    - Fixed a possible bug regarding proper ac3 audio codec
      detection which probably depends on the used libdvdread
      version. Thanks to Ronny Buchmann <ronny-transcode AT
      vlugnet.org> who reported a bug in dvd::rip's automatic file
      conversion, which is most likely a consequence of an
      failed ac3 detection.

0.48.2 [stable branch] Sun 24 Nov 2002, joern
    Bugfix:
    - transcode 0.6.2 changed its progress output for transcoding
      frames ranges. dvd::rip didn't show a valid progress bar
      due to that. Thanks for the report to Florin Andrei.

0.48.1 [stable branch] Sat 23 Nov 2002, joern
    Note:
    - transcode 0.6.2 was released on 22. November. dvd::rip
      works with all 0.6 releases, but 0.6.2 is recommended.
      dvd::rip disables some features for smaller versions.

    Features:
    - Added 64 kbit/s audio bitrate preset entry. Suggested by
      Miguel J. Jimenez <cactus_espinado AT yahoo.es>
    - ffmpeg video codec setting adjusted to the new ffmpeg
      interface of transcode 0.6.2. Thanks for the hint to
      Stefano <stefano AT symbola.it>
    - subtitleripper version is now checked, a correspondent
      note is printed, if a version smaller than 0.3 is detected.
      Arne Driescher build a transcode independent tarball
      of this release, which you can get from Sourceforge:
      http://sourceforge.net/projects/subtitleripper

    Bugfixes:
    - Burning tab: label information followed file selection only
      on the GUI, but old values were used internally.
    - IFO file copying didn't work for DVD image projects. Thanks
      for the report to Arne Driescher.
    - thranduil <thranduil AT free.fr> reported that dvd::rip's
      vcdimager command works only with long options. I can't
      reproduce this, but I switched over to the long options,
      just to be sure.

0.48.0 [stable branch] Sun 17 Nov 2002, joern
    Notes:
    - transcode 0.6.2.20021114 is the recommended version for
      this release. 0.6.0 and 0.6.1 still work, but dvd::rip
      lacks features with them, e.g. subtitle support.
    - From 0.47.6 on dvd::rip needs to know the mount point of your
      DVD device. So open the preferences dialog and enter your
      mount point there. Also the DVD must be mountable by the
      user who executes dvd::rip.
    - File format changed slightly with 0.47.2, but is backward
      compatible. dvd::rip prints a short message when converting
      an older file to the new format.
    - Version numbering changes with this release. It follows
      the common MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH scheme. Two branches are
      distuingished using the MINOR number: the stable branch
      uses even numbers, the unstable odd. So the next stable
      release is 0.50.0, bugfixes on 0.48.0 will be numbered 
      0.48.1, 0.48.2 etc and the next unstable branch is 0.49.1,
      0.49.2 etc.
    - Read all change log entries of 0.47 to see what changed
      in detail since 0.46.

    Bugfixes:
    - Fixed a "division by zero" bug on Clip & Zoom tab.
    - Subtitles: test transcoding threw an exception, if no
      preview images were grabbed. Reported by Andreas Lemke.

0.47.12 Wed 13 Nov 2002, joern
    Bugfixes:
    - Changing mp2 bitrate threw an exception. Thanks for the report
      to Andreas Lemke <andreas.lemke AT epost.de>
    - Transcoding failed, if no subtitles were detected. Also
      reported by Andreas Lemke.
    - Message about wrong transcode version on the subtitle tab
      was too big, the project window needed to grow for it.

0.47.11 Tue 12 Nov 2002, joern
    Note:
    - Actual transcode pre-0.6.2 snapshots have a bug in cluster
      mode, which destroys A/V sync, while transcode 0.6.1 works
      fine. The next transcode snapshot should fix that issue.
      Until that happens I suggest using 0.6.1 for cluster
      operation.

    Features:
    - Reorganized the video options widgets on the transcode tab
      a bit. Makes more sense now, in my opinion.
    - Menu entry "Operate/Create dvdrip-info file" (dvdrip-info
      file is by default created when you start transcoding).
    - Information about subtitles added to the dvdrip-info file.

    Bugfixes:
    - The subtitle grabbing frame/timecode entry rejected
      timecode values.
    - Autoadjust presets failed, when the movie had unusual
      frame sizes (mostly this happened, if the preview frame
      was a bad choice, e.g. it's mostly black. Then letterbox
      detection didn't work properly and dvd::rip's autoadjust
      mechanism bailed out).
    - Subtitle sort order in selection popup was alphanumeric.
    - Subtitle preview grabbing still didn't work if the
      selection popup wasn't touched after ripping.
    - Pressing the "Scan volume" button did nothing if the
      title wasn't ripped, instead of telling the user, *that*
      the title isn't ripped ;) Thanks for the report to

    - Cluster mode:
      - Nodes stopped by hand, didn't get online anymore
	after starting them again.
      - Nodes' "stopped" state wasn't restored properly in
	case of a dvdrip-master restart.

0.47.10 Wed 06 Nov 2002, joern
    Features:
    - DVD mounting only for copying the IFO files, not for TOC
      reading and ripping. Because the mount may make problems
      (if your system isn't configured properly), this reduces
      the harm a bit, because only the IFO files will be missing.
      This affects vobsub subtitle generation only, everything
      else will work as usual.

    Bugfixes:
    - IFO file copying didn't work, if the DVD wasn't mounted
      already.
    - Fractional volume rescale values were rejected. Thanks for
      the report to Laurent Grawet.

0.47.9 Fri 01 Nov 2002, joern
    Bugfixes:
    - Spaces in the frame range entries produced illegal transcode
      options. Reported by Andrea Carpani <ancarpan AT tiscalinet.it>.
    - All entry fields are now syntax checked (e.g. non-digits
      are rejected when a number is expected).
    - When ripping multiple titles or chapters, dvd::rip calculated
      6 GB x (number of titles/chapters) as the assumed disk space,
      instead of assuming 6 GB once. Reported by Michel Alexandre
      Salim.
    - Cancelling a rip after a disk usage warning didn't set
      the ripping GUI sensitive again.
    - Cluster mode: switch node state from offline to online after
      a 20 second delay (a booting machine answeres ping requests
      some time before the ssh daemon is up - this way the system
      has 20 seconds to start the ssh daemon after starting the
      network; this should suffice). Requested by Matthias Kukuk
      <m.kukuk AT gmx.de>
    - AC3 audio tab was always active, even if the selected audio
      channel was no AC3.
    - Ripping didn't work, when the DVD wasn't mounted by the user
      before.

0.47.8 Wed 30 Oct 2002, joern
    Bugfixes:
    - Fixed a typo which breaks subtitle transcoding. Thanks to
      Paul Gohn <pgohn AT nexgo.de> for the report and
      William Hawkins <whawkins AT vt.edu> for the fix.

0.47.7 Tue 29 Oct 2002, joern
    Features:
    - Added another RPM spec file RedHat-Rawhide-Video-DVDRip.spec.
      Sorry for my ignorance, but I don't understand anything of
      RPM spec files and don't why or whether they are really distro
      specific or not. I just add them, if I get them. This one
      was sent by Ragnar Kjørstad <dvdrip AT ragnark.vestdata.no>.
      Thanks.

    Bugfixes:
    - The "dvd mount point" check in the preferences dialog didn't
      work reliably with all distributions, so I dropped it (resp.
      the existence of the mount point is checked only). Thanks
      to Douglas Bollinger for the report.
    - dvd::rip now checks the mount state of the DVD reliably
      and really mounts the DVD only, if it isn't mounted yet
      (considering automounters, which were problematic). Thanks
      to Davide Ferrari for the bug report.

0.47.6 Mon 28 Oct 2002, joern
    Notes:
    - From now on dvd::rip needs to know the mount point of your
      DVD device. So open the preferences dialog and enter your
      mount point there. Also the DVD must be mountable by the
      user who executes dvd::rip.
    - To get vobsub support you must re-read the TOC from your DVD.
      (which nukes your settings of the project - sorry, but it's
       a beta release).

    Features:
    - Subtitles: dvd::rip now creates vobsub files, which can be
      played with mplayer, using Arne Driescher's subtitle2vobsub.
      Splitting is considered, you get one vobsub per splitted file.
      You can create the vobsub by pressing the appropriate button
      on the Subtitle tab, or by checking "Create later after
      transcoding". Chapter mode isn't supported. Cluster mode support
      will follow (you can start vobsub creation from dvd::rip's
      Operate menu after transcoding with the cluster). A .rar file is
      created, if rar is present on your system. You need a recent
      mplayer (I use 0.90pre9) to play rar-vobsub files. Attention:
      your rar binary *must not* be newer than 2.x (3.x isn't
      supported by mplayer; I use rar 2.71 with success here).
      It's hard to find such an old version, so you can grab it
      from here: http://www.exit1.org/dvdrip/contrib/rarlnx271.sfx.bin
      Thanks to Arne for the hint about rar-vobsub and again for
      his great subtitleripper package. You can play a vobsub with
      these mplayer options:

      mplayer -vobsub movie-001-sid02 movie-001.avi

      (In this example the vosub file(s) are "movie-001-sid02.rar"
       resp. "movie-001-sid02.{ifo,sub,idx}")

    - IFO files: dvd::rip copies the .ifo files into the project's
      tmp/ifo directory when reading the TOC.
    - Disc size popup became a combo box, so you can enter arbitrary
      disc sizes (for customized splitting, e.g. if you want to
      leave space for other stuff, you want to put on the CD's).
    - dvd::rip prints a warning message if you use RH 8.0 without
      the PERLIO=stdio environment variable set. Requested by
      Michael Mason <mgm AT eskimoman.net>. NEEDS TESTING, please
      report to dvdrip-user, whether this works!

    Bugfixes:
    - transcode supports rendering subtitles only with -x vob, that
      means I had to switch off rendering support for on-the-fly
      and dvd-image-ripping. Creating vobsub's work for all modes.
    - Subtitle grabbing didn't work for titles which have only one
      subtitle, or if you never explicetely selected a subtitle from
      the popup. You must re-read the TOC for the fix to take effect.
      Thanks to Michèl Alexandre Salim for the extensive bug report.
    - When ripping on-thy-fly or from an DVD image, the "Rip" button
      is disabled instead of alter it to a "Volume scan" button.
      Volume scanning can be done on the Transcode tab, so this function
      is rather confusing on the Rip tab.
    - When zoom width/height were empty, dvd::rip produced illegal
      fast resizing transcode options.
    - CD burning: list of files was refreshed when entering the
      transcode tab instead of the burn tab.
    - dvd::rip crashed on first startup, when no ~/.dvdriprc file
      was present. Thanks to Davide Ferarri for the detailed report.

0.47.5 Wed 16 Oct 2002, joern
    Features:
    - Extensive support for rendering subtitles on the movie
      (creating vobsub files is prepared, not yet implemented
      but coming soon). Subtitle stuff is on its own tab, documentation
      will follow. You need at least transcode 0.6.2.20021010 for this
      to work. For existent projects you must re-read the DVD TOC,
      because subtitle-detection is done here. Also you need a recent
      CVS version of subtitle2pgm from Arne Driescher's subtitleripper
      package. You can find it on his project homepage:

      http://subtitleripper.sourceforge.net/

      If you're unfamilar with CVS: I put a snapshot together of the
      version I'm currently using. You can find it here:

      http://www.exit1.org/dvdrip/contrib/subtitleripper-20021015.tgz

      Thanks a lot to Arne, who added some features on my request
      to make it work seamlessly with dvd::rip.
      dvd::rip's subtitle support isn't finished yet, a few things
      could be improved, e.g. the suggestion functions should be
      capable of addding black bars in the clip1 stage or addding black
      bars in clip2 for 4:3 movies etc. Stay tuned.
    - When transcoding a .dvdrip-info file is generated, which
      contains some interesting technical information about the
      created movie file. Thanks to Moritz Bunkus for this
      suggestion.
    - Use a notebook for the different audio codecs supported by
      dvd::rip, instead of struggling around with making widgets
      sensitive when possible. This makes things much clearer and
      is more flexible, because audio options can differ much more,
      depending on the selected codec. Also pages of codecs, which
      aren't supported with the current settings, are hided instead
      of making them unsensitive.
    - DVD audio popup now shows "=> skip" for audio tracks, which
      are not selected for transcoding. I had some reports of users
      regarding wrong transcoded audio channels, but in fact they
      missed activating the desired audio track correctly. I hope
      such misunderstandings don't happen anymore now.
    - Status bar shows free disk space, when idle.
    - Free disk space is checked before starting a job which
      needs some. dvd::rip currently doesn't know in advance
      how much space a ripped title will need. As a thumb rule
      dvd::rip warns if less than 6GB are available. Space
      checking applies to standard mode only, not cluster mode.
    - After an intensive mailing list discussion about the correct
      file extension for OGG files containing video tracks
      (.ogg vs .ogm), I yielded to Roland Seuhs arguments and
      decided that .ogm is now the default file extension for OGG
      files. You can change this in the preference dialog, if you
      prefer .ogg (or an arbitrary different file extension...)
    - CD burning / cdrdao command: if the configured cdrdao command
      contains the 'write' option already, dvd::rip doesn't add
      it again. This way you can provide specific cdrdao options.
      (cdrdao expects 'write' as the first parameter). Thanks
      to Christian Herrmann <paras.rasmatazz AT t-online.de> for
      the hint 
    - Added a rpmspecs/ folder in the distribution, which currently
      contains RPM spec files for SuSE 8.0 and RedHat 8.0. I doesn't
      maintain all of these files personally, e.g. version numbers
      may be outdated or something like that. But I hope they are
      useful anyway. Thanks to Michèl Alexandre Salim <salimma1
      AT yahoo.co.uk>, who provided the RedHat and to Rainer Lay
      Lay for the SuSE file.

    Bugfixes:
    - Clip&Zoom video preview command did not appear in the
      logfile. Thanks to Michael Bushey for the report.
    - Not enough: Clip&Zoom video preview didn't even work from
      ripped VOB's. Same report by Michael Bushey.
    - Add. transcode options weren't passed through when
      transcoding audio for multiple audio tracks (e.g. -D to
      correct A/V sync mismatch). Thanks to Clint Silvester
      <clint AT focuscompanies.com> for his report.
    - Clipping didn't work if clip entries were empty (which
      should be interpreted as 0 instead). Reported by Michael
      Bushey.
    - Audio size calculation on transcode tab wasn't correct
      (calculated base 1024 instead 1000), but the correct value
      was used for video bitrate calculation.
    - When changing from mp3 to vorbis dvd::rip automatically
      choose vorbis for additional tracks on the GUI, but this
      wasn't stored internally, so generated transcode commands
      still had mp3 options. Reported by edaniel <edaniel AT
      perso.mine.nu>.
    - Titles with no target audio track threw an exception in
      cluster mode. As long as the cluster doesn't support this,
      dvd::rip prevents adding such a title to a cluster. Reported
      by Rainer Lay.

0.47.4 Sun 6 Oct 2002, joern
    Bugfixes:
    - On the fly CD burning didn't work (fortunately without
      destroying the CD...).
    - Updated RPM spec file which now considers pstree for
      standard mode.

0.47.3 Sun 6 Oct 2002, joern
    Notes:
    - dvd::rip now generally depends on 'pstree' not only in
      cluster mode
    - Red Hat 8.0's Perl distribution has a bug regarding
      pipes using non-blocking I/O. dvd::rip doesn *not* work
      with RH 8.0 due to this. Refer to the news entry 2002/10/06
      on http://www.exit1.org/dvdrip/ for details.

    Features:
    - Simple CD burning facility. Supports ISO, VCD2 and SVCD
      types. Needs mkisofs, cdrecord for ISO operation and
      vcdimager, cdrdao for (S)VCD operation.
      All commands can and must be configured in the global
      preferences. cdrecord and cdrdao must be able to operate
      as a normal user resp. the user who executes dvd::rip.
      cdrecord must either be set-uid-root or executed through
      xcdrwrap from an existent xcdroast installation. cdrdao
      must be set-uid-root or the CD burner device file must
      be writable by the user who executes dvd::rip.
      Warning: currently *no* special checking beside existence
      of the needed tools is done, so use this on your own risk.
      Try burning in "test mode" first. I tested this with
      * cdrecord 1.11a31
      * cdrdao 1.1.5
      * mkisofs 1.15a29
      * vcdimager 0.7.12
      and don't know if other versions work, too.
    - Debugging window shows CD burning commands for the selected
      file entries.
    - Global preferences now splitted into several pages of
      a notebook widget. Added a simple checking of the specified
      values, e.g. if the DVD device and default project directory
      are writable, or if specified tools exist.
    - New preference: ogg file extension. Suggested by Moritz Bunkus.
      dvd::rip defauls to '.ogg', but you can switch to '.ogm' or
      arbitrary extensions, if this makes using the files more
      comfortable for you.
    - Added a rpm spec file Video-DVDRip.spec, so you can simply
      build a .rpm archive from the .tar.gz using 
      > rpm -ta Video-DVDRip-0.XX.tar.gz
      Thanks to Rainer Ley for the spec file template.
    - Button "Nuke log file" on logging tab, which resets the
      log file.
    - dvd::rip now opens the preferences dialog, if no ~/.dvdriprc
      is found resp. on first startup.

    Bugfixes:
    - PSU core setting was ignored when adding add. audio-tracks,
      reported by Lethal Weapon <lethalwp AT tiscali.be>
    - Window title was not cleared, if a project was closed,
      reported by Fabio Russo

0.47.2 Mon 30 Sep 2002, joern
    Note:
    - File format changed slightly, but is backward compatible.
      dvd::rip prints a short message when converting an older
      file to the new format.

    Features:
    - Experimental OGG/Vorbis audio support. If you choose
      Vorbis as an audio codec, the result will be a .ogm
      file with DivX/Xvid/whatever video and Vorbis audio
      (so this implicetely switches the resulting file container
      format from AVI to OGG - which will become an explicite
      option, once OGG support is more complete).

      Splitting is supported. Cluster mode support available only
      for movies with one PSU. Movies with more than one PSU will be
      supported when ogmtools provide a program for concatenating
      OGG streams. Multiple audio tracks are supported, but you
      currently can't mix mp3/ac3/vorbis codecs for the same title.
      (mp3/ac3 is supported by ogmtools, but without A/V sync).
      You need ogmtools 0.950 and transcode 0.6.1 for the whole
      thing to work. You can get ogmtools here:

      http://www.bunkus.org/videotools/ogmtools/index.html

      Thanks to Moritz Bunkus for writing ogmtools and answering
      my questions.

    - when opening a project file, dvd::rip now selects
      automatically the tab which was selected when the file
      was saved.
    - new dvdrip command line options "-f {transcode|transcode_split}"
      and "-t title-nr" to select a title of a given project file
      on startup and transcode (and optionally split) it.
      dvd::rip exits after finishing, so this can be used for
      simple batch transcoding a bunch of projects/titles, if
      cluster mode is no option for you (e.g. in case of NTSC movies).
      Thanks to Rainer Lay for his suggestion.

      Example: dvdrip -t 1 -f transcode_split movie.rip

    Bugfixes:
    - Cluster mode: if a frame range was set, dvdrip-master
      crashed with a fatal error (transcoding a frame range
      is still not supported with cluster mode, but really no
      need for dvdrip-master to crash here... ;)

0.47.1 Sun 29 Sep 2002, joern
    Bugfixes:
    - Progress information was messed up when transcoding
      chapters from a DVD image or when doing direct DVD
      transcoding. Because dvd::rip can't know the chapter
      length in advance in this case, now no progress information
      is printed (no percent/eta), only fps and elapsed time.
      Thanks to David Rosky <d_rosky AT nccn.net> for his
      detailed bug report.
    - Chapter mode: ripping progress is related to the length
      of the title, what is confusing if not all chapters are
      selected. For single chapter ripping now no percent/eta
      progress is printed anymore. Reported by David Rosky.
    - Cluster mode: node test didn't work (stalled). Thanks for
      the report to Fabio Russo <f.russo AT anthesia.it>.
