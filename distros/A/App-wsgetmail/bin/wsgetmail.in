=head1 NAME

wsgetmail - get mail from cloud webservices

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Run:

    wsgetmail [options] --config=wsgetmail.json

where C<wsgetmail.json> looks like:

    {
    "client_id": "abcd1234-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-1234abcdef99",
    "tenant_id": "abcd1234-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-123abcde1234",
    "secret": "abcde1fghij2klmno3pqrst4uvwxy5~0",
    "global_access": 1,
    "username": "rt-comment@example.com",
    "folder": "Inbox",
    "command": "/opt/rt5/bin/rt-mailgate",
    "command_args": "--url=http://rt.example.com/ --queue=General --action=comment",
    "action_on_fetched": "mark_as_read"
    }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

wsgetmail retrieves mail from a folder available through a web services API
and delivers it to another system. Currently, it only knows how to retrieve
mail from the Microsoft Graph API, and deliver it by running another command
on the local system.

=head1 INSTALLATION

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    sudo make install

C<wsgetmail> will be installed under C</usr/local/bin> if you're using the
system Perl, or in the same directory as C<perl> if you built your own.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

=over 4

=item --config, --configuration, -c

Path of the primary wsgetmail JSON configuration file to read. This argument
is required. The configuration file is documented in the next section.

=item --options

A string with a JSON object in the same format as the configuration
file. Configuration in this object will override the configuration file. You
can use this to extend a base configuration. For example, given the
configuration in the synopsis above, you can process a second folder the
same way by running:

    wsgetmail --config=wsgetmail.json --options='{"folder": "Other Folder"}'

=item --verbose, --debug, -v

Log additional information about each mail API request and any problems
delivering mail.

=item --dry-run

Read mail and deliver it to the configured command, but don't run the
configured C<action_on_fetched> like deleting messages or marking them as
read.

=item --help, -h

Show this help documentation.

=back

=head1 CONFIGURATION

=head2 Configuring Microsoft 365 Client Access

To use wsgetmail, first you need to set up the app in Microsoft 365.
Two authentication methods are supported:

=over

=item Client Credentials

This method uses shared secrets and is preferred by Microsoft.
(See L<Client credentials|https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/msal-authentication-flows#client-credentials>)

=item Username/password

This method is more like previous connections via IMAP. It is currently
supported by Microsoft, but not recommended. (See L<Username/password|https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/msal-authentication-flows#usernamepassword>)

=back

This section walks you through each piece of configuration wsgetmail needs,
and how to obtain it.

=over 4

=item tenant_id

wsgetmail authenticates to an Azure Active Directory (AD) tenant. This
tenant is identified by an identifier that looks like a UUID/GUID: it should
be mostly alphanumeric, with dividing dashes in the same places as shown in
the example configuration above. Microsoft documents how to find your tenant
ID, and create a tenant if needed, in the L<"Set up a tenant"
quickstart|https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-create-new-tenant>. Save
this as the C<tenant_id> string in your wsgetmail configuration file.

=item client_id

You need to register wsgetmail as an application in your Azure Active
Directory tenant. Microsoft documents how to do this in the L<"Register an
application with the Microsoft identity platform"
quickstart|https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app#register-an-application>,
under the section "Register an application." When asked who can use this
application, you can leave that at the default "Accounts in this
organizational directory only (Single tenant)."

After you successfully register the wsgetmail application, its information
page in your Azure account will display an "Application (client) ID" in the
same UUID/GUID format as your tenant ID. Save this as the C<client_id>
string in your configuration file.

After that is done, you need to grant wsgetmail permission to access the
Microsoft Graph mail APIs. Microsoft documents how to do this in the
L<"Configure a client application to access a web API"
quickstart|https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-configure-app-access-web-apis#add-permissions-to-access-microsoft-graph>,
under the section "Add permissions to access Microsoft Graph." When prompted
to select permissions, select all of the following:

=over 4

=item * Mail.Read

=item * Mail.Read.Shared

=item * Mail.ReadWrite

=item * Mail.ReadWrite.Shared

=item * openid

=item * User.Read

=back

=back

=head3 Configuring client secret authentication

We recommend you deploy wsgetmail by configuring it with a client
secret. Client secrets can be granted limited access to only the mailboxes
you choose. You can adjust or revoke wsgetmail's access without interfering
with other applications.

Microsoft documents how to create a client secret in the L<"Register an
application with the Microsoft identity platform"
quickstart|https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app#add-a-client-secret>,
under the section "Add a client secret." Take care to record the secret
token when it appears; it will never be displayed again. It should look like
a completely random string, not a UUID/GUID.

=over 4

=item global_access

Set this to C<1> in your wsgetmail configuration file.

=item secret

Set this to the secret token string you recorded earlier in your wsgetmail
configuration file.

=item username

wsgetmail will fetch mail from this user's account. Set this to an email
address string in your wsgetmail configuration file.

=back

=head3 Configuring user+password authentication

If you do not want to use a client secret, you can also configure wsgetmail
to authenticate with a traditional username+password combination. As noted
above, this method is not recommended by Microsoft. It also does not work
for systems with federated authentication enabled.

=over 4

=item global_access

Set this to C<0> in your wsgetmail configuration file.

=item username

wsgetmail will authenticate as this user. Set this to an email address
string in your wsgetmail configuration file.

=item user_password

Set this to the password string for C<username> in your wsgetmail
configuration file.

=back

=head2 Configuring the mail delivery command

Now that you've configured wsgetmail to access a mail account, all that's
left is configuring delivery. Set the following in your wsgetmail
configuration file.

=over 4

=item folder

Set this to the name string of a mail folder to read.

=item command

Set this to an executable command. You can specify an absolute path,
or a plain command name which will be found from C<$PATH>. For each
email wsgetmail retrieves, it will run this command and pass the
message data to it via standard input.

=item command_args

Set this to a string with additional arguments to pass to C<command>.
These arguments follow shell quoting rules: you can escape characters
with a backslash, and denote a single string argument with single or
double quotes.

=item action_on_fetched

Set this to a literal string C<"mark_as_read"> or C<"delete">.
For each email wsgetmail retrieves, after the configured delivery
command succeeds, it will take this action on the message.

If you set this to C<"mark_as_read">, wsgetmail will only retrieve and
deliver messages that are marked unread in the configured folder, so it does
not try to deliver the same email multiple times.

=back

=head1 TESTING AND DEPLOYMENT

After you write your wsgetmail configuration file, you can test it by running:

    wsgetmail --debug --dry-run --config=wsgetmail.json

This will read and deliver messages, but will not mark them as read or
delete them. If there are any problems, those will be reported in the error
output. You can update your configuration file and try again until wsgetmail
runs successfully.

Once your configuration is stable, you can configure wsgetmail to run
periodically through cron or a systemd service on a timer.

=head1 LIMITATIONS

=head2 Fetching from Multiple Folders

wsgetmail can only read from a single folder each time it runs. If you need
to read multiple folders (possibly spanning different accounts), then you
need to run it multiple times with different configuration.

If you only need to change a couple small configuration settings like the
folder name, you can use the C<--options> argument to override those from a
base configuration file. For example:

    wsgetmail --config=wsgetmail.json --options='{"folder": "Inbox"}'
    wsgetmail --config=wsgetmail.json --options='{"folder": "Other Folder"}'

NOTE: Setting C<secret> or C<user_password> with C<--options> is not secure
and may expose your credentials to other users on the local system. If you
need to set these options, or just change a lot of settings in your
configuration, just run wsgetmail with different configurations:

    wsgetmail --config=account01.json
    wsgetmail --config=account02.json

=head2 Office 365 API Limits

Microsoft applies some limits to the amount of API requests allowed as
documented in their L<Microsoft Graph throttling guidance|https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/throttling>.
If you reach a limit, requests to the API will start failing for a period
of time.
