Revision history for Plugin-Simple

        - fixed a missed croak() if a plugin file can't be found, breaking

0.06    2016-03-25
        - we now croak if a plugin package can't be found and no default is
          set (closes #4)
        - package in cwd is now loaded properly (closes #5)

        - removed _cache()
        - removed _config()
        - updated POD to reflect 'default' option

0.04    2016-03-21
        - in scalar context, plugins() will return the first plugin found
        - we now use Module::Load to do the dirty work, as ExtUtils::Installed
          relies on .packlist files, which not all modules provide
        - changed certain tests to use local modules instead of skipping
        - added github links into Makefile.PL (thanks Mohammad Anwar (MANWAR))
