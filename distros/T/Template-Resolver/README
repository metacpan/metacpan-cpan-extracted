NAME

    Template::Resolver - A powerful, and simple, library for resolving
    placeholders in templated files

VERSION

    version 1.14

SYNOPSIS

      use Template::Resolver;
      my $resolver = Template::Resolver->new($entity);
      $resolver->resolve(file => '/path/to/file', key => 'REPLACEME');

DESCRIPTION

    This module provides a powerful way to resolve placeholders inside of a
    templated file. It uses Template::Transformer to interpolate the the
    placeholder values. The provided template may refer to entity values
    directly (i.e. ${TEMPLATE{my.entity.value}}) or through transformations
    (i.e. ${TEMPLATE_perl{property("my.truthy") ? "true" : "false"}}). You
    may also loop over hash and array entities like this (newlines and
    indentation included for clarity):

      ${TEMPLATE<CLUB>:{my.clubs}}$
          {TEMPLATE<MEMBER>:{<CLUB>.members}}
              ${TEMPLATE{<MEMBER>.name}} is a member of the ${TEMPLATE{<CLUB>.club_name}} club.
          ${TEMPLATE<MEMBER>:end}
      ${TEMPATE<CLUB>:end}

    You may access the key when iterating over hashes:

      ${TEMPLATE<RESOURCE>:{my.resources}}
          Resource, ${TEMPLATE:<RESOURCE.key>} is ${TEMPLATE{<RESOURCE>.deployed_artifact}}
      ${TEMPLATE<RESOURCE>:end}

    You may also access the index when iterating over arrays:

      ${TEMPLATE<CLUB>:{my.clubs}}
          Club at index ${TEMPLATE<CLUB.ix>} is ${TEMPLATE{<CLUB.name>}}
      ${TEMPLATE<CLUB>:end}

CONSTRUCTORS

 new(\%entity, %options)

    Creates a new resolver with properties from \%entity and %options if
    any. The available options are:

    additional_transforms

      Additional custom transforms that will be added to the standard
      transforms. Must be a hashref containing transform name to sub
      reference mappings. The sub reference(s) will be called as a
      method(s) with a single parameter containing the contents of the
      placeholder.

    os

      The operating system path format used when resolving
      ${TEMPLATE_os{xxx}} placeholders.

METHODS

 resolve(%options)

    Will read the template and replace all placeholders prefixed by key.
    One of the options content, handle, or filename is required. The
    available options are:

    content

      A string containing templated content.

    filename

      The name of a file containing templated content.

    handle
