NAME
    once - Execute code only once throughout the program's lifetime

VERSION
    version 1.101420

SYNOPSIS
        use once;

        sub setup {
            my $self = shift;
            ONCE {
                print "run only once however often setup() is called"
            };
            # other_things();
        }

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides a way to run code only once, no matter how often
    the surrounding code is called.

METHODS
  ONCE
    This subroutine is exported automatically. It takes a code block and
    executes it only the first time that this specific call of "ONCE" is
    encountered. This might be useful, for example, in a situation where you
    initialize an object but only want to do it the first time any object of
    that class is initialized, perhaps to install methods or setup some
    other data.

INSTALLATION
    See perlmodinstall for information and options on installing Perl
