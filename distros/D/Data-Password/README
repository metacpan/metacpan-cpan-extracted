NAME
    Data::Password - Perl extension for assessing password quality.

SYNOPSIS
            use Data::Password qw(IsBadPassword);

            print IsBadPassword("clearant");

            # Bad password - contains the word 'clear', only lowercase

            use Data::Password qw(:all);

            $DICTIONARY = 0;

            $GROUPS = 0;
   
            $SKIPCHAR = 0;

            print IsBadPassword("clearant");

DESCRIPTION
    This module checks potential passwords for crackability. It checks that
    the password is in the appropriate length, that it has enough character
    groups, that it does not contain the same characters repeatedly or
    ascending or descending characters, or charcters close to each other in
    the keyboard. It will also attempt to search the ispell word file for
    existance of whole words. The module's policies can be modified by
    changing its variables. (Check "VARIABLES"). For doing it, it is
    recommended to import the ':all' shortcut when requiring it:

    *use Data::Password qw(:all);*

FUNCTIONS
    1   IsBadPassword(password)

        Returns undef if the password is ok, or a textual description of the
        fault if any.

    2   IsBadPasswordForUNIX(user, password)

        Performs two additional checks: compares the password against the
        login name and the "comment" (ie, real name) found on the user file.

VARIABLES
    1   $DICTIONARY

        Minimal length for dictionary words that are not allowed to appear
        in the password. Set to false to disable dictionary check.

    2   $FOLLOWING

        Maximal length of characters in a row to allow if the same or
        following. If $FOLLOWING_KEYBOARD is true (default), the module will
        also check for alphabetical keys following, according to the English
        keyboard layout. Set $FOLLOWING to false to bypass this check.

    3   $GROUPS

        Groups of characters are lowercase letters, uppercase letters,
        digits and the rest of the allowed characters. Set $GROUPS to the
        number of minimal character groups a password is required to have.
        Setting to false or to 1 will bypass the check.

    4   $MINLEN

        $MAXLEN

        Minimum and maximum length of a password. Both can be set to false.

    5   @DICTIONARIES

        Location where we are looking for dictionary files. You may want to
        set this variable if you are using not *NIX like operating system.

    6   $SKIPCHAR

        Set $SKIPCHAR to 1 to skip checking for bad characters.

    7   $BADCHARS

        Prohibit a specific character range. Excluded character range
        regualr experssion is expect. (You may use ^ to allow specific
        range) Default value is: '\0-\x1F\x7F' For ASCII only set value
        $BADCHARS = '^\x20-\x7F'; Force numbers and upper case only
        $BADCHARS = '^A-Z1-9';
