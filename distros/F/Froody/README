DESCRIPTION
    Froody is a framework that can be used to easily create both a server
    and a client for making remote API calls across the web.

    Froody communicates by the AJAX friendly calling convention of passing
    parameters to methods via CGI parameters and returning XML data
    structures as a response. The Froody framework handles all the nastyness
    of dealing with the CGI and XML for you, so all you really have to worry
    about in your Perl code is actually getting the job done. In particular,
    it lets you define a strict spec for what will be returned simply by
    example, making new methods quick and easy to write.

  What Documentation Is There?
    First, before you do anything else, you want to read Froody::QuickStart.
    This is the basic tutorial which'll get you up and running and give you
    and idea of what Froody is all about.
