NAME
    FTN::Nodelist - Process FTN nodelist

SYNOPSIS
     my $ndl = new FTN::Nodelist(-file => '/fido/var/ndl/nodelist.*');
     if (my $node = $ndl->getNode('2:550/4077')) {
       print $node->sysop();
     } else {
       warn 'Cannot find node';
     }

DESCRIPTION
    "FTN::Nodelist" contains functions that can be used to process Fidonet
    Technology Network nodelist and pointlist.

METHODS
  new
    This method creates "FTN::Nodelist" object. Can get following arguments:

    Nodelist file path:

     -file => '/path/to/nodelist'

    Path can point to definite file (ex.: '/var/ndl/nodelist.357') or
    contain wildcard (.*) instead of digital extension. Maximum extension
    value will be used to find exact nodelist (ex.: '/var/ndl/nodelist.*')

    Cacheable status:

     -cache => 0/1

    Default is 1. When cacheable status is set to 1, all search results are
    stored in object cache. It saves resources when searching the same
    address, but eats memory to store results. Choose appropriate behaviour
    depending on your tasks.

  getNode( $addr )
    Takes FTN address as argument. Address can be feed in 3D or 4D style
    (Zone:Net/Node, Zone:Net/Node.Point).

    If 4D style is specified, point address is searching.

    Returns "FTN::Nodelist::Node" object if node can be found in nodelist.

    See FTN::Nodelist::Node for details how these results can be used.

    Examples:

      my $node = $ndl->getNode('2:550/0');
      my $node = $ndl->getNode('2:2/0');
      my $node = $ndl->getNode('2:550/4077');
      my $node = $ndl->getNode('2:550/4077.101');

KNOWN ISSUES
    When using wildcard in nodelist path, maximum extension is taken into
    account. It may bring to wrong results when there are many nodelist
    files and current nodelist has lesser number (for example,
    "nodelist.365" and "nodelist.006").

    This issue may be resolved in next versions of "FTN::Nodelist".
