NAME
    XML::RSS::Feed - Persistant XML RSS Encapsulation

VERSION
    2.4

SYNOPSIS
    A quick and dirty non-POE example that uses a blocking sleep. The magic
    is in the late_breaking_news method that returns only headlines it
    hasn't seen.

        use XML::RSS::Feed;
        use LWP::Simple qw(get);

        my $feed = XML::RSS::Feed->new(
            url    => "http://www.jbisbee.com/rdf/",
            name   => "jbisbee",
            delay  => 10,
            debug  => 1,
            tmpdir => "/tmp", # optional caching
        );

        while (1) {
            $feed->parse(get($feed->url));
            print $_->headline . "\n" for $feed->late_breaking_news;
            sleep($feed->delay); 
        }

    ATTENTION! - If you want a non-blocking way to watch multiple RSS
    sources with one process use POE::Component::RSSAggregator.

    If you want to fetch a feed, mark all the headlines as seen, then get
    events for any new headlines, pass 'init_headlines_seen => 1' to the
    constructor.

CONSTRUCTOR
  XML::RSS::Feed->new( url => $url, name => $name )
    Required Params

        *   name

            Identifier and hash lookup key for the RSS feed.

    Optional Params

        *   delay

            Number of seconds between updates (defaults to 600)

        *   tmpdir

            Directory to keep a cached feed (using Storable) to keep
            persistance between instances.

        *   init_headlines_seen

            Mark all headlines as seen from the intial fetch, and only
            report new headlines that appear from that point forward.

        *   debug

            Turn debuging on.

        *   headline_as_id

            Boolean value to use the headline as the id when URL isn't
            unique within a feed.

        *   hlobj

            A class name sublcassed from XML::RSS::Headline

        *   max_headlines

            The max number of headlines to keep. (default is unlimited)

METHODS
  $feed->parse( $xml_string )
    Pass in a xml string to parse with XML::RSS and then call process to
    process the results.

  $feed->process( $items, $title, $link )
  $feed->process( $items, $title )
  $feed->process( $items )
    Calls pre_process, process_items, post_process, title, and link methods
    to process the parsed results of an RSS XML feed.

    *   $items

        An array of hash refs which will eventually become
        XML::RSS::Headline objects. Look at XML::RSS::Headline->new() for
        acceptable arguments.

    *   $title

        The title of the RSS feed.

    *   $link

        The RSS channel link (normally a URL back to the homepage) of the
        RSS feed.

  $feed->pre_process
    Mark all headlines from previous run as seen.

  $feed->process_items( $items )
    Turn an array refs of hash refs into XML::RSS::Headline objects and
    added to the internal list of headlines.

  $feed->post_process
    Post process cleanup, cache headlines (if tmpdir), and debug messages.

  $feed->create_headline( %args)
    Create a new XML::RSS::Headline object and add it to the interal list.
    Check XML::RSS::Headline->new() for acceptable values for %args.

  $feed->init_all_headlines_seen()
    After fetching a feed for the first time, mark all headlines as seen so
    we don't generate a flood of events. Basically don't issue an event for
    any existing headlines, but for any headline from that point on.

  $feed->num_headlines
    Returns the number of headlines for the feed.

  $feed->seen_headline( $id )
    Just a boolean test to see if we've seen a headline or not.

  $feed->headlines
    Returns an array or array reference (based on context) of
    XML::RSS::Headline objects

  $feed->late_breaking_news
    Returns an array or the number of elements (based on context) of the
    latest XML::RSS::Headline objects.

  $feed->cache
    If tmpdir is defined the rss info is cached.

  $feed->set_last_updated
  $feed->set_last_updated( Time::HiRes::time )
    Set the time of when the feed was last processed. If you pass in a value
    it will be used otherwise calls Time::HiRes::time.

  $feed->last_updated
    The time (in epoch seconds) of when the feed was last processed.

  $feed->last_updated_hires
    The time (in epoch seconds and milliseconds) of when the feed was last
    processed.

SET/GET ACCESSOR METHODS
  $feed->title
  $feed->title( $title )
    The title of the RSS feed.

  $feed->debug
  $feed->debug( $bool )
    Turn on debugging messages

  $feed->init
  $feed->init( $bool )
    init is used so that we just load the current headlines and don't return
    all headlines. in other words we initialize them. Takes a boolean
    argument.

  $feed->name
  $feed->name( $name )
    The identifier of an RSS feed.

  $feed->delay
  $feed->delay( $seconds )
    Number of seconds between updates.

  $feed->link
  $feed->link( $rss_channel_url )
    The url in the RSS feed with a link back to the site where the RSS feed
    came from.

  $feed->url
  $feed->url( $url )
    The url in the RSS feed with a link back to the site where the RSS feed
    came from.

  $feed->headline_as_id
  $feed->headline_as_id( $bool )
    Within some RSS feeds the URL may not always be unique, in these cases
    you can use the headline as the unique id. The id is used to check
    whether or not a feed is new or has already been seen.

  $feed->hlobj
  $feed->hlobj( $class )
    Ablity to use a subclass of XML::RSS::Headline. (See Perl Jobs example
    in XML::RSS::Headline::PerlJobs). This should just be the name of the
    subclass.

  $feed->tmpdir
  $feed->tmpdir( $tmpdir )
    Temporay directory to store cached RSS XML between instances for
    persistance.

  $feed->init_headlines_seen
  $feed->init_headlines_seen( $bool )
    Boolean value to mark all headlines as seen from the intial fetch, and
    only report new headlines that appear from that point forward.

  $feed->max_headlines
  $feed->max_headlines( $integer )
    The maximum number of headlines you'd like to keep track of. (0 means
    infinate)

DEPRECATED METHODS
  $feed->failed_to_fetch
    This should was deprecated because, the object shouldn't really know
    anything about fetching, it just processes the results. This method
    currently will always return false

  $feed->failed_to_parse
    This method was deprecated because, $feed->parse now returns a bool
    value. This method will always return false

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
    Special thanks to Rocco Caputo, Martijn van Beers, Sean Burke, Prakash
    Kailasa and Randal Schwartz for their help, guidance, patience, and bug
    reports. Guys thanks for actually taking time to use the code and give
    good, honest feedback.

    Thank for to Carl Furstenberg for providing feedback for new constructor
    param of 'init_headlines_seen' so you won't get flooded with headlines
    on the first fetch of the feed.

    Thanks to Slaven Rezic for pointing out that t/008_store_retrieve.t
    pointed to broken rss tests on jbisbee.com (that I don't own anymore)

    Thanks to Aaron Krowne for patch for XML::RSS::Headline to use guid as
    the unique id instead of url if its available.
