Revision history for Perl extension Class::DBI::Factory.

0.994 17 April 2005
    - handler back to mod_perl 1 (with great relief) after widespread
      grumbling about premature shift to mod_perl2.
    - CDF::Handler2 available for experiments with mod_perl2
    - new() now a synonym for instance() since a call to instance() is
      now dropped into each data class. this caused a bug in which data 
      classes would get the wrong factory back if the right factory had
      been created with a call to new().
    - fancy new Makefile.PL that installs the demo for you if you like, 
      and adjusts the dependencies appropriately.
    - documentation tidied up at top, rewritten further down.
    - factory startup methods gathered behind init() to 
      simplify future changes.
	- load_class tests whether the class is already loaded, thanks to 
	  clever line pinched from Merlyn. Factory now ok if many data classes 
	  are declared in one file.
	- interface to CDF::Mailer tidied up a bit.
	- Back to SQLite3. added DBD::SQLite 1.08 dependency to Makefile 
	  because 1.07 generates all those warnings. This might be a 
	  nuisance but it means that the demo runs without extra cpanning.
	- moved from CVS to SVN
	- once mod_perl2 settles down, this is likely to be released as v1.
    
0.99  18 February 2005
    - handler now mod_perl2 only.
    - db_Main hooks in data classes now inserted for you.
    - severely tidied up: everything non-essential removed
    - mail-sending functions separated out into Class::DBI::Factory::Mailer
      (mostly to make them optional)
    - new relationships() method in Factory retrieves useful bits of 
      cdbi meta_info.
    - all SQLite mentions now SQLite2, to avoid spurious warnings from 
      newer versions.
    - works much better without config file
    - all hard work deferred for as long as possible to make cdf fit better
      into nasty quick data-munging type scripts.
    - demo application brought up to date, cleaned up, made to work properly
    - documentation redone. still pretty windy, though.
    - tests more extensive. still no proper handler tests, though.
    
0.86
    - Package-handling greatly improved.
    - Documentation updated to explain about problems with live_object 
      index and database shuffling
    - boosterism got rid of to simplify documentation.
    - ghosts made more useful, flexible

0.85
    - Various small fixes and tweaks over the last four point releases,
      mostly to exception-handling and list-building.

0.81
    - Silly MANIFEST error corrected.

0.80
    - Should be a drop-in replacement, with subclasses working exactly
      as before, but much extended:
    - Class::DBI::Factory::Exception now provides a base class for 
      systematic, mod_perl-friendly exception handling. All CDF family
      now throw exceptions based on Apache return codes.
    - CDF::Handler now much more useful and adaptable: includes full 
      request-handling skeleton that should allow handler classes of
      only a few lines.
    - CDF::Ghost added (from Delivery) to simplify handling of 
      object precursors (and deletion relics).
    - Demo application brought up to date. still doesn't store, though.
    - We now have tests for all modules except the Handler, which is
      only use_ok'd. Apache integration is needed for Handler tests :(

0.77
    - minor tweaks to handler base class provide a better way to set
      mime type during response cycle.

0.76  Tues 22 June 2004
    - Brought up to date with Class::DBI 0.96 and Ima::DBI 0.33
      Definitely doesn't work with earlier versions: requirements updated.
      Not guaranteed (or likely) to work with later versions.
    - tweaks to documentation and tests

0.75 Fri 23 April 2004
    - list object now accepts prefix parameter used to mark input/output
      relevant to this list, and allow inclusion of several lists on one page.
    - minor improvements to Factory class, but no interface changes.
    - pager-handling unborked thanks to Bill Moseley
    - demo updated to paginate properly
    
0.742 Fri 5 March 2004
    - bugs introduced by bug fix fixed.

0.741 Fri 5 March 2004
    - pager tests made conditional on presence of Class:DBI::Pager (d'oh).
    
0.74  Weds 3 March 2004
    - tests no longer require Term::Prompt, so as to get out of the
      dilemma of whether to record it as a dependency or not. This means
      the tests don't work in mysql now, but it means the dependencies
      are all that's required to run make test (so we get past CPAN testers)
    - tests skip if DBD::SQLite not present.
    - template processing consolidated in the factory so that it only
      needs to subclassed in one place.
    - more debugging flags in Factory.pm
    - officially works with cdbi 0.95 (I had forgotten to update :)
      should be fine with anything 0.9x, iirc.
    - lots more tests
      
0.73  Tues 2 March 2004
    - debugging hooks spread throughout the system in a way that's useful
      to subclasses. Configuration files now supply a debug_level that
      controls the amount of detail supplied. exception handling still
      poor, though.
    - This version is the first uploaded to CPAN.

0.72
    - bugfix: template path reversed before use, so that later definitions
      appear earlier in path: allows package templates to override core
      which was the whole point.
    - various dull internal rationalisations
    - bugfix: CDF::Config::package_loaded() now works. stupido.
    - factory now exposes using() method for template decisions based 
      on packages loaded. package/plugin thing generally smartened up 
      behind it.
    
0.71  Thursday Jan 28 2004
    - made the dbh connection method compatible with sybase by allowing the 
      omission of db_name.
    - configuration file can supply a whole DSN if required to get around 
      compatibility issues (sugg. Ed Sabol).

0.70  Tue Jan 26 2004
    - first public release, and so heavily rewritten as to bear little relation 
      to any previous version except in the names of the methods, so I shan't bother 
      recording changes except to observe that the package/plugin thing, automatic 
      configuration refresh and POD are all new in this release and therefore less 
      beaten into shape than other parts.
