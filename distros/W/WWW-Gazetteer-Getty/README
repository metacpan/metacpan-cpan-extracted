NAME
    WWW::Gazetteer::Getty - Find location of world towns and cities

SYNOPSYS
      use WWW::Gazetteer;
      my $g = WWW::Gazetteer::Getty->new('getty');
      my @londons = $g->find('London', 'UK');
      my $london = $londons[0];
      print $london->{longitude}, ", ", $london->{latitude}, "\n";
      my $nice = $g->find("Nice", "France")->[0];
      print $nice->{city}, ", ", $nice->{elevation}, "\n";

DESCRIPTION
    A gazetteer is a geographical dictionary (as at the back of an atlas).
    The "WWW::Gazetteer::Getty" module uses the information at
    http://www.getty.edu/research/conducting_research/vocabularies/tgn/ to
    return geographical location (longitude, latitude) for towns and cities
    in countries in the world.

    This module is a subclass of "WWW::Gazetteer", so you must use that to
    create a "WWW::Gazetteer::Getty" object. Once you have imported the
    module and created a gazetteer object, calling find($country => $town)
    will return a list of hashrefs with longitude and latitude information.

      my @londons = $g->find('London', 'UK');
      my $london = $londons[0];
      print $london->{longitude}, ", ", $london->{latitude}, "\n";
      # prints -0.1167, 51.5000

    The hashref for London actually looks like this:

      $london = {
        longitude => "-0.167",
        latitude  => "51.500",
        city      => 'London',
        country   => 'United Kingdom',
      };

    The city and country values are the same as the ones you used. The
    longitude and latitude are in degrees, ranging from -180 to 180 where
    (0, 0) is on the Prime Meridian and the equator.

METHODS
  new()
    This returns a new WWW::Gazetteer::Getty object. It currently has no
    arguments:

      use WWW::Gazetteer;
      my $g = WWW::Gazetteer->new('getty');

  find()
    The find method looks up geographical information and returns it to you.
    It takes in a country and a city, with the recommended syntax being a
    city name and ISO 3166 code.

    Note that there may be more than one town or city with that name in the
    country. You will get a list of hashrefs for each town/city.

      my @londons = $g->find("London", "UK");
      my @londons = $g->find("London", "United Kingdom");
