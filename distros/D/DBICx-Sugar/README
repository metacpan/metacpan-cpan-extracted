NAME

    DBICx::Sugar - Just some syntax sugar for DBIx::Class

VERSION

    version 0.0200

SYNOPSIS

        use DBICx::Sugar qw(schema resultset rset);
    
        # all of the following are equivalent:
    
        $user = schema('default')->resultset('User')->find('bob');
        $user = schema->resultset('User')->find('bob');
        $user = resultset('User')->find('bob');
        $user = rset('User')->find('bob');

DESCRIPTION

    Just some syntax sugar for your DBIx::Class applications. This was
    originally created to remove code duplication between
    Dancer::Plugin::DBIC and Dancer2::Plugin::DBIC.

CONFIGURATION

    Configuration can be automatically parsed from a `config.yaml` or
    `config.yml` file in the current working directory, or it can be
    explicitly set with the config function:

        DBICx::Sugar::config({ default => { dsn => ... } });

    If you want the config to be autoloaded from a yaml config file, just
    make sure to put your config data under a top level dbicx_sugar key.

 simple example

    Here is a simple example. It defines one database named default:

        dbicx_sugar:
          default:
            dsn: dbi:SQLite:dbname=myapp.db
            schema_class: MyApp::Schema

 multiple schemas

    In this example, there are 2 databases configured named default and
    foo:

        dbicx_sugar:
          default:
            dsn: dbi:SQLite:dbname=myapp.db
            schema_class: MyApp::Schema
          foo:
            dsn: dbi:Pg:dbname=foo
            schema_class: Foo::Schema
            user: bob
            password: secret
            options:
              RaiseError: 1
              PrintError: 1

    Each database configured must at least have a dsn option. The dsn
    option should be the DBI driver connection string. All other options
    are optional.

    If you only have one schema configured, or one of them is named
    default, you can call schema without an argument to get the only or
    default schema, respectively.

    If a schema_class option is not provided, then
    DBIx::Class::Schema::Loader will be used to dynamically load the schema
    by introspecting the database corresponding to the dsn value. You need
    DBIx::Class::Schema::Loader installed for this to work.

    WARNING: Dynamic loading is not recommended for production
    environments. It is almost always better to provide a schema_class
    option.

    The schema_class option should be the name of your DBIx::Class::Schema
    class. See "SCHEMA GENERATION" Optionally, a database configuration may
    have user, password, and options parameters as described in the
    documentation for connect() in DBI.

 connect_info

    Alternatively, you may also declare your connection information inside
    an array named connect_info:

        dbicx_sugar:
          default:
            schema_class: MyApp::Schema
            connect_info:
              - dbi:Pg:dbname=foo
              - bob
              - secret
              -
                RaiseError: 1
                PrintError: 1

 replicated

    You can also add database read slaves to your configuration with the
    replicated config option. This will automatically make your read
    queries go to a slave and your write queries go to the master. Keep in
    mind that this will require additional dependencies:
    DBIx::Class::Optional::Dependencies#Storage::Replicated See
    DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI::Replicated for more details. Here is an
    example configuration that adds two read slaves:

        dbicx_sugar:
          default:
            schema_class: MyApp::Schema
            dsn: dbi:Pg:dbname=master
            replicated:
              balancer_type: ::Random     # optional
              balancer_args:              # optional
                  auto_validate_every: 5  # optional
                  master_read_weight:1    # optional
              # pool_type and pool_args are also allowed and are also optional
              replicants:
                -
                  - dbi:Pg:dbname=slave1
                  - user1
                  - password1
                  -
                    quote_names: 1
                    pg_enable_utf8: 1
                -
                  - dbi:Pg:dbname=slave2
                  - user2
                  - password2
                  -
                    quote_names: 1
                    pg_enable_utf8: 1

 alias

    Schema aliases allow you to reference the same underlying database by
    multiple names. For example:

        dbicx_sugar:
          default:
            dsn: dbi:Pg:dbname=master
            schema_class: MyApp::Schema
          slave1:
            alias: default

    Now you can access the default schema with schema(), schema('default'),
    or schema('slave1'). This can come in handy if, for example, you have
    master/slave replication in your production environment but only a
    single database in your development environment. You can continue to
    reference schema('slave1') in your code in both environments by simply
    creating a schema alias in your development.yml config file, as shown
    above.

FUNCTIONS

 schema

        my $user = schema->resultset('User')->find('bob');

    Returns a DBIx::Class::Schema object ready for you to use. For
    performance, schema objects are cached in memory and are lazy loaded
    the first time they are accessed. If you have configured only one
    database, then you can simply call schema with no arguments. If you
    have configured multiple databases, you can still call schema with no
    arguments if there is a database named default in the configuration.
    With no argument, the default schema is returned. Otherwise, you must
    provide schema() with the name of the database:

        my $user = schema('foo')->resultset('User')->find('bob');

 resultset

    This is a convenience method that will save you some typing. Use this
    only when accessing the default schema.

        my $user = resultset('User')->find('bob');

    is equivalent to:

        my $user = schema->resultset('User')->find('bob');

 rset

        my $user = rset('User')->find('bob');

    This is simply an alias for resultset.

 get_config

    Returns the current configuration, like config does, but does not look
    for a config file.

    Use this for introspection, eg:

        my $dbix_sugar_is_configured = get_config ? 1 : 0 ;

 add_schema_to_config

    This function does not touch the existing config. It can be used if
    some other part of your app has configured DBICx::Sugar but did not
    know about the part that uses an extra schema.

        add_schema_to_config('schema_name', { dsn => ... });

SCHEMA GENERATION

    Setting the schema_class option and having proper DBIx::Class classes
    is the recommended approach for performance and stability. You can use
    the dbicdump command line tool provided by DBIx::Class::Schema::Loader
    to help you. For example, if your app were named Foo, then you could
    run the following from the root of your project directory:

        dbicdump -o dump_directory=./lib Foo::Schema dbi:SQLite:/path/to/foo.db

    For this example, your schema_class setting would be 'Foo::Schema'.
