1.000000 2014-04-27T11:25:29Z
 [00 Major]
 - This is a major set of changes, but mostly forwards compatible.
 - Only a few minor packaging backcompat risks for downstream $VENDORs who work by HAND.

 [01 DZil 5 Encoding Support]
 - Dist::Zilla >= 5.0 is now mandatory
 - Callback functions now pass an "encoding" value ( either 'text' or 'bytes' )
 - This is mostly a pragmatic choice, if it can be decoded, you probably want to work with it decoded
 - Otherwise you'll probably want to work with it as bytes.

 [02 New Functions]
 - A whole bunch of new functions have been added which are more DWIM and trying smarter to advoid the horrible black
   magic. - auto_munge_file now the most recommended approach, but supports no laziness overiding.

 [03 Less Black Magic]
 - There's still a rebless trick or two to cast the refs in-place, but they should be more stable and less prone to
   initialization-based errors.

 [04 New Tooling]
 - ExtUtils::MakeMaker has taken precedence over Module::Build
 - Dependencies on latest versions are now only recommended, not required.

 [05 New Verson Scheme]
 - 0.y.z -> 1.yyyzzz
 - This is the primary reason for the 1.x on the box.
