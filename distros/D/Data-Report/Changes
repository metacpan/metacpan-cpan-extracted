Revision history for Data-Report

0.10	2008-08-18

	Add column property 'class' for HTML plugin. Can be used to
	supply a different class from the default h_XXX and c_XXX.

	The special row for headings has been changed from "head" to
	"_head" to avoid conlicts with ordinary row styles.

0.09	2008-08-07 22:16

	Add column property 'ignore'. Does what the name implies.
	This change was suggested by Mário Silva.

	Upgrade requirements for Text::CSV to 1.00.

0.08	2008-08-07 14:27

	Allow handling of Latin texts with CSV plugin and Text::CSV_XS.
	This change was suggested by Mário Silva.

0.07	2008-08-03 16:26

	Add 'raw_html' style mod for HTML plugin. When a cell has this
	property, the data will be placed in the cell unmodified. This
	makes it possible to place pre-prepared HTML code in the cell.
	This change was suggested by Cristina Nunes.

0.05	2006-06-08 15:46

	Better SYNOPSIS + doc fixes.

0.04	2006-06-08 15:20

	Under debian linux, Text::CSV seems to be a wrapper for
	Text::CSV_XS which caused test t/03csv02.t to fail.

	Under perl 5.6, output was written to a file '*main::STDOUT',
        since in older perls refering to a filehandle glob needs an
        additional \.

0.03	2006-05-22 22:03

	Integrate API docs into Data::Report.
	Add get_type method.
	Add topheading attribute. Eliminates most needs for
	$rep->set_heading.
	Row attribute 'ignore'.
	Column attribute 'wrap_indent'.
	Handle alignment < > | in HTML.
	CSV plugin will use Text::CSV_XS or Text::CSV if installed.

0.02	2006-05-01 23:08

	Small documentation fixes.
	Prevent DB from being attempted by the CPAN indexer.

0.01    2006-05-01 16:05

        First version, derived from actual working code of a big
	application. I turned it into a generic CPAN module. During
	the process, some features may have become unstable, but that
	will be cured in time. Also, it is possible that revisions of
	the API will be necessary when new functionality is added.
