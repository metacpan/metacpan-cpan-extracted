"#" items are GitHub issues since the 0.72 release see <https://github.com/OpenGuides/OpenGuides/issues> before that they were tickets on <http://dev.openguides.org>

More detailed changelogs can be found at
<http://github.com/OpenGuides/OpenGuides>

0.84    22 December 2020
        Switch to HTTPS for map tiles and icons, to avoid mixed-content
        warnings.
        Use Wiki::Toolkit 0.86 to fix issues with modern versions of MySQL
        Allow configuration of OpenGuides using environment variables
        Add a Dockerfile which runs OpenGuides under Plack

0.83    06 January 2020
        Remove use of MapQuest tiles, as they're no longer available.
        Add full CGI URL to popups on map search results, so they can be
          used in addon scripts.
        Fix broken version link in ?action=about
        Make sure index pages don't offer page deletion links.
        Upgrade Leaflet version to 1.1.0.
        Make sure HTTPS website links are truncated in same way as HTTP.
        Stop escaping commas in URLs in places that got missed last time.
        Attempts to autocreate categories/locales with underscores in the name
          will now see all underscores changed to spaces.

0.82    05 June 2016
        Add some extra CSS hooks to the templates.  Add new base stylesheet
          rules for a responsive version.  Make a few changes in core templates
          to facilitate the responsive version.  To get all these shiny new
          features, you need to set the "responsive" config variable to true.

0.81    10 January 2016
        Trim leading/trailing whitespace from the fax field (so those of us
          using this field to store the Twitter username don't get broken
          links).
        Stop escaping commas in URLs generated by internal links, category
          listings, locale listings, and Recent Changes (because these URLs
          look ugly and escaping isn't necessary).

0.80    07 June 2015
        Fix calling CGI:param in a list context #85

0.79    31 May 2015
        Add search_content_munger_module option to allow munging of node
        content before indexing for search (Plucene and Lucy only).

        Add support for the OpenGraph Protocol #77
        Add IRC metadata #80
        Remove the @RSS macro #33

0.77    20 September 2014
        Fix tests to work with more upto date versions of SQLite 
        Thanks to @jmdh and Niko Tyni. See PR #78 for more info.

0.76    08 December 2013
        Add facility to create custom macros and override existing ones.

0.75    23 November 2013
        Add a Lucy backend for searching.  This is still experimental,
          so we recommend most people stick with Plucene for now.
        If you do change to Lucy, you will need to reindex your entire guide
          (see examples/reindex.pl in the distribution).

0.74    19 July 2013
        Skip the correct number tests in t/210_json.t

0.73    17 July 2013
        Bump required version of Wiki::Toolkit::Plugin::JSON to remove
          deprecation warnings. 
        Node JSON output now contains image information.
        Node JSON output now includes raw and html formatted content.
        Add the external class to website and map links when
          displaying them in the metadata section of a node. 
        Add the @NODE_COUNT macro to count the number of nodes 
          in a category/locale.
        Allow passing Module::Build long options to Build.PL. Fixes #71.

0.72    28 June 2013
        Fix the date in json output. Fixes #5
        Allow a custom template, custom_auto_map_link.tt to populate
          map links in node metadata
        Updated metadata since code and issues have moved to github
          https://github.com/OpenGuides/OpenGuides/
        Split out the node location search section of the node template.
        Add an optional custom template to node_location_search.tt 
        Added a README.pod to make github look pretty
        Updated OpenGuides.pm pod
        Add a Vagrantfile and docs to help with testing and development
        Add configuration for Travis and Coveralls
          https://travis-ci.org/OpenGuides/OpenGuides
          https://coveralls.io/r/OpenGuides/OpenGuides

0.71    16 March 2013
        Added scale to category/locale index maps.
        Fix several test failures triggered by the stricter
          Test::HTML::Content (et al) mode used when XML::LibXML is
          not installed
        Work around a "No such method textContent" bug in
          Test::HTML::Content when XML::LibXML is not installed
        Respect destdir when installing scripts, templates, etc and
          when initialising SQLite databases
        Use mkpath to create the custom template directory rather than
          mkdir, for cases where the parent directory doesn't already
          exist

0.70    26 August 2012
        New elements allowed in page content: span, dl, dt, dd (fixes #303).
        Changed external link formatting; they're now given a class of
          "external" and the previous hardcoded square brackets are no more.
          This requires version 0.24 of Wiki::Toolkit::Formatter::UseMod.
          If you want the old behaviour back, put this in your CSS (with
          "black" replaced by whatever colour you have your body text in):
              a.external:before {
                content: "[";
                color: black;
              }

              a.external:after {
                content: "]";
                color: black;
              }
        Updated to use version 0.4 of Leaflet (needed for plugins used on a
          couple of live guides).
        Added meta descriptions to headers of map and list index pages
          (fixes #301).
        Implemented new @INDEX_LIST_NO_PREFIX macro.

0.69    07 July 2012
        The output of the "show_missing_metadata" action is now alphabetised.
        There's also now an option to view the results on a map. (#296 & #294).
        Fixed a JavaScript escaping issue for nodes with apostrophes in names.

0.68    21 May 2012
        Made sure that maps are centred and zoomed properly even when they only
          contain one point.
        Made preferences default to never expiring.
        Fixed POST bug introduced with whitespace redirection in version 0.66.

0.67    07 May 2012
        Switched from the Google Maps API to the Leaflet mapping library.
          To make this work, set use_leaflet = 1 in your wiki.conf, and ensure
          that div#map_index_canvas is given a non-zero height in your
          stylesheet (you may also want to style div#map_index_node_list and
          div#node_map_canvas).  Google Maps support is retained for those
          who fear change, but is no longer actively maintained.
        Added support for indexing on category and locale at the same time.
          As part of this, action=index now uses a new form of parameters, so
          instead of e.g.
            action=index;index_type=locale;index_value=holborn
          you should use
            action=index;loc=holborn
          or indeed
            action=index;cat=pubs;loc=holborn
          Format params such as format=map work as before.  Old-style URLs
          will automatically redirect to new-style ones.
        Added project metadata to Build.PL (#285).
        Skip Build.PL questions if AUTOMATED_TESTING=1 (#291)
        Added a basic stylesheet, installed into the static_path directory.
        Fixed the JSON output for action=index (using a new dependency on
          Template::Plugin::JSON::Escape).
        Added JSON output for the preferences page (#293).
        IP addresses no longer show on recent changes for people without the
          admin preference set.
        Website truncation on node display is now a little more intelligent
          (you can still tweak this by setting website_link_max_chars in
          your wiki.conf).
        The preferences page now remembers what page the user got to it from,
          and sends them back there.
        Fixed bug with recent changes display when minor edit suppressed (for
          which we require version 0.80 of Wiki::Toolkit).
        Renumber tests so we have more room (#297).
        Fix warnings in tests due to undef values being lower cased (#298).

0.66    12 April 2012
        All templates now have access to the "username" TT variable.
        Node name parameters in URLs are now accepted with spaces instead of
          underscores, to take account of people typing manually - these will
          redirect (303) to the proper URLs with underscores (#114).
        Add CSS classes for each category and locale to the "content" div
          (and hence we now require version 2.24 of Template).
        Switch to using Geo::Coordinates::OSGB/ITM instead of
          Geography::NationalGrid (which no longer exists on CPAN).
        Make sure that whitespace is collapsed in autocreated categories
          and locales, to avoid creating undeletable pages.
        Add an autocreate_content.tt template to include a map link in content
          for autocreated categories and locales (#275).
        Make sure the show_missing_metadata action skips redirects.

0.65    28 February 2010
        Fix some more broken POD and add POD unit test (#268)
        Don't display revision info for nodes that don't exist (#193)

        Add read_only config option to turn off edits on a guide

        Metadata discovery features (action=metadata)
        JSON support for node details and metadata discovery

        and truncate URLs that are too long (#21)
        Change default database type to sqlite (#241)
        Set content charset correctly in RDF (#260)
        Display geodata ellipsoid to user in edit from (#230)
        Fix install with CPAN when Config::Tiny not already installed (#224)
        Add an admin navbar, to be displayed if the user requests (#261)
        Move the node image outside the metadata div, to aid styling (#222)
        Add the ability to whitelist hosts who can change moderated nodes
          without explicit moderation (#203)
        Don't add delete links unless the user requests (#159)
        Fix clean target to remove everything it should (#242)
        Warn about errors fetching remote RSS feeds, but carry on
          generating the page content (#228)
        Work around Wiki::Toolkit bug #41 by displaying minor edits by
          default
        Correctly paginate search when geodata is supplied (#267)

0.63    16 August 2008
        Major overhaul of RDF output.
        * Remodelled addresses using WAIL.
          (http://www.eyrie.org/~zednenem/2002/wail/)
        * Include node image as foaf:depiction.
        * Link dc:contributor items in RDF output to actual URIs that exist in

          opening hours value and replace with Dublin Core "available" term.
        * Replace unnecessary instances of rdf:ID with rdf:nodeID.
        * Model relationship of neighborhood to parent city.
        * Reduce acres of whitespace in output and clean up indenting.
        Added a Universal Edit Link (http://universaleditbutton.org/) (#254)
        Update references to http://openguides.org moved URLs
        Update Google Analytics code to support new version (#255)
        Some pages didn't properly include Google Analyatics; fix this (#257)

0.62    8 June 2008
        Allow wiki page links (simple: [[Foo]], title: [[Foo|bar]]) in
          change summaries.
        Ensure that all modules we ship are versioned.
        Added experimental support for local IP blacklisting modules; see the
          display_node method in "perldoc OpenGuides" for details.
        Don't include redirect pages in search results. (#24)
        Include map link URLs in RDF output. (#26)
        Hide historic versions of nodes from search engines. (#207)
        Install signal handlers in reindex.pl and CGI scripts to allow
          temporary files (eg from Plucene) to be cleaned up. (#247)

0.61    4 July 2007
        Added experimental support for local spam detection modules; see the
          commit_node method in "perldoc OpenGuides" for details.
        Added extra "edit this page" link next to the node name; if you don't
          want it, add div#title_edit_link {display:none;} to your stylesheet.
        Removed dependency on Test::MockObject.
        Remove misleading CSS examples
        Support alternative database ports (#165)
        Only display the google maps preference if node maps are enabled
          (#192).
        Respect redirect=0 (#104).
        If an unknown action is supplied to wiki.cgi, redirect to
          action=display (partial fix for #102)
        Added new div#nonexistent_node_message for displaying message when
          someone tries to view a nonexistent node.
        Validate input geodata (#22)

        Add email notifications when moderated nodes are edited (#138)
        Add IP addresses into non-anonymous changes in Recent Changes (#113)
        Add an OpenSearch description, and automatic discovery for it (#180)
        Include machine-readable link to licence, if configured (#226)

0.60    13 May 2007
        Removed footer search from edit page (shouldn't have been there).
        Upgraded Module::Build requirement to cope with API change.
        Added new parameters to action=random - you can now supply category
          and/or locale to get a random page chosen from that category/locale.
        To go with this, added a new macro:
          @RANDOM_PAGE_LINK [[Category Pubs|View a random pub]]
        Fixed bug in OpenGuides::Feed - HTML equivalent link now works even
          if your script_name isn't blank.
        Rewrote the HTML of the edit page to use <div>s rather than tables.
          Note that you will probably want to provide at least basic styling
          for these classes.  As part of this, added a new template,
          edit_form_actions.tt
        Moved node image boxes below phone/address/etc on the edit form, and
          moved summary field from openguides information section into main
          section.
        Made div#maincontent on the edit form wrap the preview view only, not
          the whole form.
        Added links to the "revision N" and "Last edited" text in the navbar.
        Added format => "raw" option to OpenGuides::Search->run to let you get
          your results back as a hash.
        Add JavaScript to the Create New Page page so the prefilled
          "New page name" disappears when you click in the field (it doesn't
          make anything other than "New page name" diappear).
        Move node RDF generation from inline to node_rdf.tt and replace
          home-grown escaping with encode_entities_numeric from HTML::Entities
          (technically this is an added dependency, but we already require
          the package it comes in, via Wiki::Toolkit::Formatter::UseMod).
        Move random page functionality from wiki.cgi into OpenGuides.pm and
          add some tests.
        Add config options to let admins omit category and/or locale pages
          from the list of pages that can be returned by the Random Page link.
        Use full URLs for all links in navbar, so people can INCLUDE navbar.tt
          in their own scripts.  (May revisit this later using "base href".)
        Added some stylesheet hooks to newpage.tt; see README.CSS for details.
        Documented the stylesheet hooks in the admin interface (see README.CSS)
        Bugfix: uninitialized variable warning in script_url
        Bugfix: Make sure clean target works

0.59    25 March 2007
        Move preview_node() and edit_node() from wiki.cgi into OpenGuides.pm
        Remove edit_conflict.tt - use edit_form.tt instead to reduce
          duplication.
        Make sure to always pass the config object into the templates.
        Add some extra test utilities to OpenGuides::Test
        Allow Guide admins to control the content of autocreated nodes (#47).
        Let people add name of copyright holder, licence URL, and info page
          URL for node images (#179).
        Add config option to omit recent changes from home page.
        Split out "modules" from navbar.tt into separate templates navbar_*.tt
          to make it easier for people to change the order in a custom template
        Add a new div to wrap the entire body; also, use header.tt in
          home_node.tt instead of copy/paste.
        Add a new div for the atom/RSS feed links on the recent changes page.
        Add config option to place content above navbar in HTML.
        Add config option to suppress inline maps on geotagged nodes.
        Add support for custom template to add to page <head> (#191).
        Fix preferences to take notice of users turning off inline Google maps.
        Add option to include Google Analytics.
        Fix "Link to this page" on index maps to remember the map type and
          the thing it's indexing (#190).
        Write tests for and fix:
          #48 (Edit conflict page erroneously converts lat/lon to os_x, os_y).
          #173 (edit conflict form doesn't let you edit everything).
        Fix:
          #184 (Build.PL doesn't treat the absence of Config::Tiny gracefully.)
        Add admin function for reverting changes by a specified user or host.

0.58    21 December 2006
        Tidy up some minor bugs in the new features.
        Add RDF autodiscovery link to nodes' <head> section.
        Added more data to RDF output
        Redesign node history view along lines of that used by MediaWiki
          (http://www.mediawiki.org/) for clarity.
        Add UPGRADING file which summarises important information for people
          upgrading.
        Add an optional new config parameter, http_charset, which will set
          an explicit charset http header on all responses.
        Add an optional new config parameter, ping_services, which is a list
          of services (defined in Wiki::Toolkit::Plugin::Ping) to ping when
          a node is written. Allows you to ping pingerati etc on changes.
        Helmert Transforms, so that British National grid users can have
        accurate Google Maps tie-ins.
        dbencoding config variable to tell OpenGuides what charset your
          database encoding is.
        As a consequence declare the charset correctly in the XML feeds.
        Other minor UI improvements
        Redesigned node history view a la MediaWiki for greater clarity.


0.57    12 September 2006
        New interfaces:
        * Admin interface.
        * Show nodes missing metadata.
        * Moderate edits (based on Wiki::Toolkit moderation).
        NOTE: these functions should be considered unstable, and may change
          over future releases.

        Lots more Atom and RSS feeds, including for searching.
        Four new config file options: moderation_requires_password,
          enable_node_image, enable_common_categories, enable_common_locales
        Search::InvertedIndex support is deprecated as of this release.
          Please upgrade to Plucene if you are still using it.
        Tidy up some template bits

0.56    14 June 2006
        Fixed bug introduced in feed formatting where Atom feeds would be
          produced when asked for RSS and vice versa.

0.55    13 June 2006
        Versioned dependency on Wiki::Toolkit to avoid development
          versions.
        Support generating feeds of a node's version listing, in addition
          to feeds of the recent changes. For more information on OpenGuides
          feeds, see http://dev.openguides.org/wiki/FeedsIntro

0.54_02 8 June 2006
        Pass the feed_listing (currently just recent_changes) through all
          the feed related code, rather than assuming it'll only ever be
          recent changes. Will allow other listings of nodes to be handled
          in the future.

0.54_01 16 May 2006
        Support for Atom feeds for RecentChanges.
        #118 Use Wiki::Toolkit. NOTE this is a development snapshot and is
          not suitable for production use. It may eat your data! Tests on
          development mirrors of live data are highly welcomed; the underlying
          database schema provided by Wiki::Toolkit has changed and the upgrade
          process needs some rigorous testing.

0.54    21 April 2006
        #112 Fixed website display bug introduced in 0.53.

0.53    20 April 2006
        Miscellanous fixes for mod_perl.
        #42 New "About" screen. Try action=about and action=about;format=rdf.
        #97 Use "summary" metadata to generate HTML meta descriptions.
        New OpenGuides::Feed module to handle feed generation (code was
          previously in OpenGuides::RDF).
        Generate URIs for locales and contributors in RDF output.
        #107 Don't display partial http:// URL in preview.

0.52    5 March 2006
        IMPORTANT CHANGE: "supersearch.cgi" is now simply "search.cgi". If you
          have customisations to your templates, you may need to make changes
          to reflect this.
        Renamed OpenGuides::SuperSearch to OpenGuides::Search.
        Use corrent content-type (application/rdf+xml) for all RDF output.
        Things with opening hours are marked as geospatial in RDF.
        Fixed missing bracket in node.tt.
        Added custom_node template just below main content in node.tt.
        Google Maps support! There is a new index type,
          wiki.cgi?action=index;format=map, and maps appear in the node listings
          (the latter feature is user-configurable).
        Fixed <link> in RSS to point to RecentChanges page, not the feed itself.
        #67 Default website for a page is now http://
        Fixed mod_perl redirect bug.
        Fixed test failure with CGI.pm 3.16.
        #87 Edit on mirrored pages now goes to source site
        #66 Locales in RDF now use dc:title, not foaf:name

0.51    15 November 2005
        Important changes:
          * The preferred way to get RecentChanges is now to pass the CGI the
            parameter "action=rc", rather than just using the page name
            "RecentChanges". However, this method will still work for the time
            being. Similarly, the URL parameter for the RecentChanges RSS feed
            has changed from "action=rss" to "action=rc;format=rss". Requests
            for the former will be redirected to the latter.

        New features:
          * When trying to view a non-existent node, you will now be presented
            with a message asking if you want to create that node, rather than
            a blank page.
          * New "summary" metadata field for one-line summaries of nodes:
            - Added summary field to RDF as dc:description.
            - Show node summary in search results.
          * New "format=raw" option for outputting wiki text of a node.
          * RSS feed now contains DOAP (http://usefulinc.com/doap) metadata.

        RDF bugfixes:
          * Locales, address and summary fields now XML-escaped properly.
          * Added "address" field that was missing from the RDF node view.
          * Update URL for Dublin Core elements in RDF index view.
          * Fixed URL in the RSS <channel> element to point to the RSS URL,
            not the RecentChanges page URL.

        Search bugfixes:
          * Fixed bug that was breaking coordinate entry fields on search page if
            lat/lon was being used.
          * Fixed bug in OpenGuides::SuperSearch that wasn't passing "latitude"
            and "longitude" values to the search template when a distance
            search was being done.

        Minor improvements:
          * Replace underscores in node names in "redirected from" message
            with spaces.
          * "Redirected from" message now links to a rendered version of
            the old page rather than the editing view.

        Miscellaneous bugfixes:
          * Fixed problem with newer Text::Wikiformat and blank nodes.
          * Fixed bug in navbar template that caused warnings in the tests.

0.50    2 October 2005
        Remove rogue ampersand that had crept into the RSS feed.

0.49    24 July 2005
        Added updated prerequisite on CGI::Wiki::Plugin::RSS::ModWiki (fixes
          a test failure).

0.48    24 July 2005
        RDF enhancements:
          * Removed redundant "id" parameter specification from dc:source in
            rdf:Description in RDF node listings.
          * Fixed bug that was causing all nodes to be flagged as a
            geo:SpatialThing whether they were or not.
          * Ensured that ampersands and greater/less than symbols were properly
            escaped so as not to be XML-toxic.
          * Added geo:lat, geo:long and RSS link attributes to items in
            category/locale listings to facilitate integration with mapping
            applications.
          * Added owl:sameAs property to RDF output for nodes that are redirects
            to other nodes.
          * RSS feed now has correct timestamp (matching most recent item) and
            matching Last-Modified HTTP header.
        Reorder navigation bar to provide more logical groupings.
        Added "format=plain" option for all-nodes index listing and associated
          template plain_index.tt.
        New message to appear on pages when you have been redirected
          informing you of the fact.
        Stop showing potentially very long map URLs in metadata section of
          node display.
        Replace ugly obliques in display of categories and locales with more
          natural commas; change "locale" to "locales" in label.
        Replace <label> tags in display_metadata.tt with <span
          class="metadata_label">.
        Wanted pages listing now displays, and sorts by, the number of nodes
          pointing to each node.
        Prevent redirect loops.
        Added _ to the list of forbidden characters in node names.

0.47    15 January 2005
        Fixed bug with list_all_versions for nodes with only one version.
        Extended config changes to examples/reindex.pl (thanks jimbo).
        Now require CGI::Wiki 0.62 to fix bug with deleting versions.
        Try to ensure that a .htaccess file protecting wiki.conf is installed.
        Allow for external URLs for Text Formatting help.
        Home node recent changes box now flags new entries.
        Made default city and country be blank; specify them if you want them.
        Missing PREREQUISITE on Plucene added.
        Added CSS id "maincontent" to exclude the navbar and footer. Misc
          template tidying including removing old layout tables.

0.46    21 December 2004
        Minor bug fixes: remove bogus edit link on index listings,
          added missing default behaviour for geolocation.
        Update supersearch help text URL.
        Added nofollow to robots meta tag.
        Added new CSS class "node_name" for inline non-hyperlink references
          to node names - see README.CSS for details.
        Fixed bug with diff display on nodes containing macros.
        Fixed distance search paging bug.
        Fixed bug that allowed autocreation of locales and categories with
          trailing spaces in the name.
        Config management refactoring. This should not result in any
          user-visible changes, apart from introducing a new dependency on
          Class::Accessor.
        Make it clearer in documentation that overriding factory templates
          is a risky activity.
        Update feedback details and include URL of RT queue.
        Added missing tests to MANIFEST so they are included with the
          distribution.

0.45    1 December 2004
        Made the geolocation stuff work worldwide.  Squeeeeeee!
        You can now choose between doing your distance calculations with
          the British National Grid, the Irish National Grid, or a UTM
          ellipsoid.  If you wish to use anything other than the British
          National Grid and you have pre-existing location data then you
          will need to save an edit of each node with location data before
          distance searches will work.
        In less exciting news:
          Fixed bug relating to lat/long representation.
          Removed debugging warn accidentally left in last release.
          Fixed some HTML validation errors.

0.44    17 November 2004
        Remove all traces of display_categories, which was obsoleted but
          not completely removed before.
        Improved the efficiency of the search.
        Fixed a couple of minor bugs in the search - note that node.tt
          and supersearch.tt have changed.
        Change the default indexer for new installs to Plucene.
        Only run certain search-related tests if Plucene is installed.

0.43    21 October 2004
        Fixed broken navbar changes that crept into last release.

0.42    20 October 2004
        Handle distance searching with OpenGuides::Supersearch instead of
          find_within_distance action.
        Fixed bug with paging on distance-only search (reported by Bob Walker).
        Improved encapsulation in OpenGuides::Supersearch - accessors.
        *INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE* Custom templates are now stored in
          user-definable path, and their names are prefixed with custom_.
          This only affects you if you have used the custom template support
          introduced in 0.41.
        Replace use of CGI::Wiki::Plugin::Geocache with improved node.tt.

0.41    21 September 2004
        Added backlinks link to navbar.
        Added some anti-robot tags to certain pages.
        Fixed bug in install procedure - blank script_name should now get
          installed as index.cgi
        Added option of munging in custom lib paths on install.
        Added option of custom templates for footer, license warning
          on edit form, banner at top of page (see CUSTOMISATION file
          for details).
        Added new macro - used as eg @INDEX_LIST [[Locale Fulham]]
        Also fixed the RSS reader macro - use this as eg
          @RSS http://london.openguides.org/?action=rss;username=Kake
        More semantic markup for metadata display - see README.CSS.

0.40    18 September 2004
        Recent Changes now shows changes in the past 24 hours, past week,
          past fortnight, and past 30 days.
        New preferences option to allow Recent Changes visit tracking.
        Preferences now has an option for when your prefs expire.
        Navbar added to diff and history pages.
        The "omit help links" preference now actually works.
        Set some pages to non-editable and non-deletable that should have been.
        Recent Changes RSS fixed so "wiki:importance" is set correctly.
        New "ignore_minor_edits" option for Recent Changes RSS.
        Added RSS feeds for contributors, locales and categories.

0.39    15 September 2004
        Split commit_node out into OpenGuides.pm in preparation for spam filter
        Added option of using Plucene for searching.  If you want to do this
          (and it is recommended over the default of Search::InvertedIndex)
          you will need to do two things:
            - either delete your old indexes (they're just files in the index
              directory) or use a different index directory
            - reindex your entire wiki (see reindex.pl in the examples/
              directory of this distribution)

0.38    26 July 2004
        Major improvements to the search result ordering (thanks to
          Steve Jolly, Bob Walker and Billy Abbott for test cases).

0.37    23 July 2004
        Fixed bug in diff view - the versions are the right way round now...
        Fixed bug with links in historic view.  Require CGI.pm 2.92 to
          avoid escapeHTML bug.

0.36    13 July 2004
        Added diff link to node template.
        Fixed case sensitivity bug in index node autocreation.
        Fixed bug with node history comments not being HTML-escaped.

0.35    25 June 2004
        Forgot to add version prerequisite on CGI::Wiki.  Don't use 0.34,
          use this.

0.34    25 June 2004
        Added facility to delete only certain revisions of a page - access
          this from the node history page.

0.33    20 June 2004
        Improve node history page to allow diffing between each version and
          the previous one or the current one.
        Test overhauls - you don't need to run the configuration step in
          order to run the tests now, but you do need to have DBD::SQLite
          for most of them.
        Fixed template bug in display_metadata.tt that was stopping map
          links being displayed for nodes with no address data (spotted
          by Steve Jolly).
        Removed inline style from recent_changes.tt. You will need to add
          the styles table#recentchanges, td.recentchanges_meta,
          td.recentchanges_user, td.recentchanges_node_name and
          td.recentchanges_comment to your stylesheets.
          td#map changed to td#map_link in edit_conflict.tt.
        Added searching by distance from an arbitrary point (click on
          Advanced Search).
        Internal rejigging - extracted some methods from wiki.cgi to
          OpenGuides.pm.
        Added new preference for default edit type.
        Reinstate apparently lost change from 0.26 to show IP rather than
          "Anonymous" in RecentChanges.
        More informative <title> tags for non-node (e.g. node version
          history) pages.

0.32    7 June 2004
        Change auto-creating behaviour of index nodes (categories and
          locales): instead of being created on access they are created
          when the referring node is committed. This fixes compliance with
          RFC 2616 section 9.1.1 and prevents corrupted index nodes being
          created accidentally.

0.31    09 May 2004
        Created a new macro to allow the embedding of RSS feeds into
          pages, using CGI::Wiki::Plugin::RSS::Reader. This allows you
          to do this to produce a list of up to ten hyperlinks:
            @RSS [http://example.com/example.rss]

        Numerous template tweaks to comply with the W3C's Web Content
          Accessibility Guidelines (http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT/):
          - summaries for all HTML tables
          - labels for all form input elements and some textual additions
            to templates, such as '/' separators between navbar items,
            because the guidelines specify links should not only be
            separated by whitespace. If you don't want these to appear,
            put the following in your stylesheet and they'll be hidden by
            CSS (but will still appear for people using textual browsers or
            screen readers): ".hidden { display: none }".
          - the "lang" element (a two-letter code identifying the language
            you're writing pages in) will now be added to the <html> tag on
            all pages; a new question has been added to the configuration
            script to ask for it and it will be stored in wiki.conf.
            ***         YOU WILL NEED TO RUN BUILD.PL AGAIN.          ***
            *** Remember to keep a backup copy of your old wiki.conf! ***

        Improved navigation for search results (next and previous n hits).
          Removed underscores from page names in search results.

        Overhauled RDF output. Changes:
          - everything is no longer classified as a restaurant(!)
          - empty tags are no longer generated
          - show categories, locales and OS x/y coords in invididual
            node RDF view
          - switch to W3C contact namespace for addressing data
          - move homepage tag out of wiki metadata
          - remove nonexistent "gs:" namespace from category indices
          - logical structure improvements (subjects of pages are now
            identified as spatial things if they are, or are RDF
            descriptions if they're not, instead of being anonymous
            FOAF topics)
          - include city and country in RDF only for spatial things.

        Fixed bug that prevented automatic database initialization on
          SQLite databases.
        Doc fix for private installations.
        Removed the following characters from the list of forbidden ones in
          node names in newpage.cgi (a restriction which dates from all the way
          back when we were using UseModWiki): " ! $ ^ ~ @ [ ] { }
        Removed newlines from output of search box macro.
        Reimplemented diffing using CGI::Wiki::Plugin::Diff as it seems the
          change in 0.30 got lost. Removed OpenGuides::Diff.pm as we should not
          be distributing it.

0.30    29 December 2003
        Added method to allow admins to delete nodes.  You will need to
          explicitly enable this option in your wiki.conf, since it brings
          with it the risk of accidental data loss.

        Major overhaul of templates - added numerous style hooks.  See
          examples/ for two stylesheet designs that take advantage of these.
          Added new banner template for page headers. Also ensured presence
          of navigation bar is consistent.
          *** INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: *** The navbar class in the stylesheet
          has been renamed to, unsurprisingly, "navbar", for consistency
          (from "toolbar"). *** YOU WILL NEED TO REWRITE YOUR STYLESHEET. ***
          You are advised to create a duplicate wiki.cgi that reads its data
          from your database but its stylesheet and templates from the new
          ones in order to test them *before* deploying them.

        Added "FAQ", "How To Get Started" and "Wiki Etiquette" to the
          navigation, under "Help" - these won't exist unless you create them
          on your site, so at first the links serve as examples of
          documentation you can provide.
        Modified preferences.cgi so that all the help links in the navbar
          can be hidden, not just the text formatting link.
        Fixed some HTML validation bugs.
        Added multiple install and pretty URL notes to INSTALL.
        Removed pubcrawl stuff from distro for now - it doesn't really work.
        Changed to use CGI::Wiki::Plugin::Diff instead of OpenGuides::Diff.

0.29    8 November 2003
        Expanded section in TROUBLESHOOTING about permissions problems.
        Diff.pm now absorbs trailing punctuation and spaces into words
          it is diffing (to give less blocky results).
        SuperSearch.pm change NOT to use '-' instead of '!'.

0.28    1 November 2003
        Allow running sites on SQLite databases.
        Fixed bug with navbar prompt in Build.PL (CPAN RT #3894).
        Junked OpenGuides::Config completely to avoid database password
          leakage, and easier install (CPAN RT #3916).

0.27    1 November 2003
        Fixed bug with category/locale indexing - no longer case-sensitive.
        Fixed bug that had the supersearch results page offering an edit link.
        Revamp of search syntax to make the SuperSearch UI much more like
          Google and Alta Vista. See the POD of SuperSearch.pm for details.

0.26    9 October 2003
        Modified TROUBLESHOOTING to reflect the correct invocation for
          Module::Build to install into a private directory.
        Show IP address for anonymous edits.
        Changed CGI.pm version dependency for Dom (CPAN bug #3895).
        Added check to OpenGuides::SuperSearch to stop it trying to
          retrieve a nonexistent node when the search indexes have screwed up.

0.25    23 September 2003
        Applied recent changes fix to front page feed as well.
        Search box now searches categories and locales as well as title and
          body - so for example a search on "holborn & pubs" will DTRT.
        NOT and phrase search tests were passing even though they shouldn't
          have been - skip them for now.

0.24    8 September 2003
        Fixed Recent Changes so minor changes don't mask major ones.
        Fixed supersearch.cgi to use a template instead of CGI.pm to avoid
          weird errors, also turned it into a module and added tests.
        Strip whitespace from OS co-ords before storing in database.

0.23    4 August 2003
        Removed the "POST_CHOMP" option as it was messing up textareas, added
          a test to make sure this doesn't reoccur.

0.22    4 August 2003
        Fixed bug with usernames containing spaces in recent changes/userstats.
        Try out create_makefile_pl => "passthrough" in Build.PL
        Minor fixes to tests to make them work with newest UseMod formatter.
        Prevented "Edit this page" from showing up on category indexes.
        Set TT "POST_CHOMP" option to strip unnecessary newlines from HTML.
        Fixed CPAN bug #3085 - quotes in change summary box.
        Added openguides_version template variable and added it to page
        footer (CPAN request 3110).

0.21    17 July 2003
        We no longer autogenerate a Makefile.PL, since it doesn't pick up
          all the questions that need to be asked.  Sorry.  Use Module::Build
          as detailed in INSTALL, since you won't be able to get the right
          version of Text::WikiFormat installed without it in any case.
        Added version number to CGI.pm prereq as Alex McLintock hit a
          version that didn't have unescape.
        Added a link on RecentChanges to the RSS version, and put an
          autodiscovery tag for the RSS in the head section.
        Changed diff feature to hide checksums, which aren't necessary for
          the user to see. Fixed a minor bug in the node history template so
          that the diff links compare the selected version against the previous
          one, not the original one every time.

0.20    10 July 2003
        Fixed all the email addresses to openguides-dev@openguides.org.

0.19    10 July 2003
        Extra checks that script_url ends in a '/'.
        Fixed small bug with edit conflict form - map link field was missing.
        Moved "content" div in a couple of templates to fix incorrect nesting.
        @INDEX_LINK macros now have optional title text like so:
          @INDEX_LINK [[Category Pubs|Pubs]]
        Added preferences option for including or excluding text formatting
          rules link in navbar.  Enable this by setting text_formatting_node
          in your config file.
        Added config option for including the navbar on the home page.

0.16    26 May 2003
        Ivor fixed OpenGuides::Diff to diff by word instead of by character.

          Many thanks to Dominic for making an Oxford OpenGuides install for

0.13    17 May 2003
        Added some more stylesheet hooks.
        Tweaked OpenGuides::Diff to make it testable, added a start at tests.
        Lat and long now stored to only 6dp instead of millions.
        Added edit field for map link.

0.12    14 May 2003
        Added OpenGuides::CGI to manage cookies and things, used this to
          do more code tidying.  Added edit box position option to preferences.

0.11    14 May 2003
        Added newpage.cgi for an easy way to create new pages.
        Took loads of repeated code (for extracting and packaging metadata
          variables) out of wiki.cgi into OpenGuides::Template.

0.10    11 May 2003
        Added OpenGuides::Diff to provide nice diff output between
          node versions.
        Added OpenGuides::Template to handle Template Toolkit stuff in a
          more testable and reusable way than just bunging it in wiki.cgi.

0.09    10 May 2003
        Added OpenGuides::UK::PubCrawl and pubcrawl.cgi as a start at a
          pub crawl generator.
        Added OpenGuides::Utils to make it easier to write little standalone
          scripts like supersearch.cgi, pubcrawl. cgi, etc.  Made wiki.cgi and
          supersearch.cgi use it, and lost loads of duplicated code in the
          process, hurrah.

0.08    3 May 2003
        Added fuzzy matching capability -
          action=index;index_type=fuzzy_title_match;index_value=hollborne
          Someone needs to write a nice search box interface for this.
        Fixed edit_conflict template and preview method to cope with stale
          checksum - passes through all the metadata properly now and offers
          a side by side comparison of what you input and what is stored.
        RDF output for node is now encoding-agnostic (used to have UTF-8
          hardcoded).  Also is now called as wiki.cgi?id=Node_Name;format=rdf

0.07    3 May 2003
        Require CGI::Wiki 0.32 to avoid bug (again a Bob find!) where
          committing a node with metadata but no content would die.
        Auto-created category/locale stub pages now added to Category Category
          or Category Locales as appropriate.
        Added a couple of extra allowed HTML tags to cater for existing
          grubstreet data.
        Fixed bug in OpenGuides::RDF - it used to die if called on a
          nonexistent node, now it returns stuff with a wiki:version of 0.

0.06    2 May 2003
        Fixed supersearch.cgi so it works with MySQL as well as Postgres
          (thanks again to Bob for finding the bug).

0.05    2 May 2003
        Redid the script and template installation so the script does
          actually get called what you said it should be (code copied
          somewhat from Siesta::Build).
        Fixed the support for non-local databases/IDENT authentication.
          I think.
        Fixed the hardcoded 'wiki.cgi' in some of the templates (thanks Bob).

0.04    29 April 2003
        First public release.
