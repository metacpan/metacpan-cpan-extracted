Net-Google-SafeBrowsing2-Redis
==============================

Redis back-end for Net::Google::SafeBrowsing2 (http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Net::Google::SafeBrowsing2).

The source code is available on github at https://github.com/juliensobrier/Net-Google-SafeBrowsing2-Redis.

The CPAN release is available at http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Net::Google::SafeBrowsing2::Redis

See http://search.cpan.org/~jsobrier/Net-Google-SafeBrowsing2/ for other back-ends: Sqlite, MySQL, Postgres, etc.


IMPORTANT

You should flush your Redis database if you are upgrading from a version lower than 0.6 (some keys were never deleted).

Version 0.3 breaks backward compatibility. If you are using version 0.2 or below, you need to reset your Redis database (i.e. start from an empty database).

As of 07/31/2012, the Redis database takes 900 MB for both Google Safe Browsing lists (malware and phishing).
