LWP-Protocol-http-SocketUnix version 0.02
====================================

LWP::Protocol::http::SocketUnix enables you to speak HTTP through UNIX sockets.
To use it you need to overwrite the implementor class of the LWP 'http' scheme.
All 'http' URIs will now be interpreted as local sockets by LWP.

The interface of LWP::Protocol::http::SocketUnix is similar to
LWP::Protocol::http, which LWP::Protocol::http::SocketUnix inherits from.
