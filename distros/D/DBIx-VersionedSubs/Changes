    * ::AutoLoad didn't remove subroutines that had
      expired. This bug remains open but there is a
      workaround in place which replaces changed subs
      with code that re-fires AUTOLOAD.

0.03 20060804
    * Added AutoLoad.pm which does lazy loading of code
      instead of loading all of the code all of the time
    * Added tests for AutoLoad.pm which ensure that the
      behaviour is identical across the two versions
      except where it isn't.
