       POE::Stage is a set of base classes for message-driven objects.  It
       cleanly implements standard patterns that have emerged from years of
       working with POE and POE::Component modules.

       As I hope the name implies, POE::Stage objects encapsulate discrete
       steps, or stages, of a larger task.  Eventually they come together to
       implement programs.

       For example, HTTP requests are performed in four or so distinct stages:
       1. The server's address is resolved.  2. The client establishes a
       connection to the server.  3. The client transmits a request.  4. The
       client receives a response.

       By design, POE::Stage promotes the decomposition of tasks into
       multiple, smaller stages.  If these stages are generic enough, new
       tasks may be handled by reusing them in different configurations.

       The hypothetical HTTP client might be a single stage composed of three
       smaller ones:  A DNS resolver stage, which accepts DNS requests and
       returns DNS responses.  A TCP client connection factory, which takes
       socket endpoint descriptions and other parameters, and eventually
       returns established connections.  Finally, there would be an HTTP
       protocol stage that uses established connections to send requests and
       parse responses.

       These stages would be encapsulated by a higher-level HTTP client stage.
       This would accept HTTP requests and return HTTP responses after
       performing the necessary steps to gather them.

       This will sound familiar to anyone working with objects.

       These objects are asynchronous and message-driven, however.  The base
       message class, POE::Request, and its subclasses, implement a standard
       request/response interface between POE::Stage objects.  Where possible,
       these messages attempt to mimic simpler, more direct call/return
       syntax, albeit asynchronously.  POE::Stage also provides a powerful
       closure-based system for maintaining request and response state, so you
       don't have to.

       To do its job, POE::Stage requires some methods for its own.  To be
       extensible, it reserves other methods for standard purposes.  To remain
       useful, it reserves the least number of methods possible.

       nneeww AARRGGUUMMEENNTT__PPAAIIRRSS

       _n_e_w_(_) creates and returns a new POE::Stage object.  An optional set of
       named ARGUMENT_PAIRS will be passed to the object's _i_n_i_t_(_) callback
       before _n_e_w_(_) returns.

       Subclasses should not override _n_e_w_(_) unless they're careful to call the
       base POE::Stage's constructor.  Object construction is customized
       through the _i_n_i_t_(_) callback instead.

       _i_n_i_t_(_) is a callback used to initialize POE::Stage objects after they
       are constructed.  POE::Stage's _n_e_w_(_) constructor passes its named
       ARGUMENT_PAIRS to _i_n_i_t_(_) prior to returning the new object.  The values
       of these arguments will be available as $arg_name lexicals within the
       _i_n_i_t_(_) callback:

         my $object = POE::Stage::Something->new( foo => 123 );

               package POE::Stage::Something;
               sub init {
                       print my $arg_foo, "\n";  # displays "123\n".
               }

       The _i_n_i_t_(_) callback is optional.

       The Handler method implements an attribute handler that defines which
       methods handle messages.  Only message handlers have access to the
       closures that maintain state between messages.

       The Handler method is used as a subroutine attribute:

               sub some_method :Handler {
                       # Lexical magic occurs here.
               }

               sub not_a_handler {
                       # No lexical magic happens in this one.
               }

       Methods with names beginning with "on_" acquire Handler magic
       automatically.

               sub on_event {
                       # Lexical magic occurs here.  No :Handler necessary.
               }

       _e_x_p_o_s_e_(_) is a function (not a method) that allows handlers to expose
       members of specific request or response OBJECT.  Each member will be
       exposed as a particular LEXICAL variable.  OBJECTs must inherit from
       POE::Request.

       The LEXICAL's name is significant.  The part of the variable name up to
       the leading underscore is treated as a prefix and ignored.  The
       remainder of the variable name must match one of the OBJECT's member
       names.  The sigil is also significant, and it is treated as part of the
       member name.

       The following example exposes the '$cookie' member of a POE::Request
       object as the '$sub_cookie' lexical variable.  The exposed variable is
       then initialized.  In doing so, the value stored into it is saved
       within the request's closure.  It will be available whenever that
       request (or a response to it) is visible.

               use POE::Stage qw(expose);

               sub do_request :Handler {
                       my $req_subrequest = POE::Request->new( ... );
                       expose $req_subrequest, my $sub_cookie;
                       $sub_cookie = "stored in the subrequest";
               }

       LEXICAL prefixes are useful for exposing the same member name from
       multiple OBJECTs within the same lexical scope.  Otherwise the variable
       names would clash.

       TODO - Describe how POE::Stage is used.  Outline the general pattern
       for designing and subclassing.

DDEESSIIGGNN GGOOAALLSS
       POE::Stage implements the most important and common design patterns for
       POE programs in a consistent and convenient way.

       POE::Stage hides nearly all of POE, including the need to create
       POE::Session objects and explicitly define event names and their
       handlers.  The :Handler subroutine attribute defines which methods
       handle messages.  There's never a need to guess which message types
       they handle:

               # Handle the "foo" message.
               sub foo :Handler {
                       ...
               }

       POE::Stage simplifies message passing and response handling in at least
       three ways.  Consider:

               my $request = POE::Request->new(
                       stage => $target_stage,
                       method => $target_method,
                       args => \%arguments,
                       on_response_x => "handler_x",
                       on_response_y => "handler_y",
                       on_response_z => "handler_z",
               );

       First, it provides standard message clasess.  Developers don't need to
       roll their own, potentially non-interoperable message-passing schemes.
       The named \%arguments are supplied and are available to each handler in
       a standard way, which is described later in the MAGICAL LEXICAL TOUR.

       Second, POE::Stage provides request-scoped closures via $req_foo,
       $rsp_foo, and _e_x_p_o_s_e_(_).  Stages use these mechanisms to save and access
       data in specific request and response contexts, eliminating the need to
       do it explicitly.

       Third, response destinations are tied to the requests themselves.  In
       the above example, responses of type "response_x" will be handled by
       "handler_x".  The logic flow of a complex program is more readily
       apparent.  It gets better, too.  See HANDLER NAMING CONVENTIONS.

       The mechanisms of message passing and context management become
       implicit, allowing them to be extended transparently.  This will be
       extended across processes, hopefully with few or no seams.

       POE::Stage includes object-oriented classes for low-level event
       watchers.  They simplify and standardize POE::Kernel's interface, and
       they allow watchers to be extended cleanly through normal OO
       techniques.  The lifespan of each resource is tightly coupled to the
       lifespan of each object, so ownership and relevance are clearly
       indicated.

       POE::Stage standardizes shutdown semantics for requests and stages.
       Requests are canceled by destroying their objects, and stages are shut
       down the same way.

       POE::Stage simplifies the cleanup of complex, multi-stage activity.
       Resources for a particular request should be stored within its closure.
       Canceling the request triggers destruction of that closure and its
       contents, which in turn triggers the destruction of the resources
       allocated to that request.  These resources include stages and requests
       created during the lifetime of the request.  They too are canceled and
       freedm

MMAAGGIICCAALL LLEEXXIICCAALL TTOOUURR
       POE::Stage uses lexical aliasing to expose state data to message
       handlers, which are specified by either the :Handler method attribute
       or the use of an on_ prefix in the method's name.

       Lexical variable prefixes indicate the data's origin.  For example,
       $arg_name is the "name" argument included with a message:

               my $request = POE::Request->new(
                       method => "something",
                       args => { name => "ralph" },
                       ...,
               );

               sub something :Handler {
                       my $arg_name;  # already contains "ralph"
               }

       The full list of prefixes and data sources:

       TThhee ""aarrgg__"" lleexxiiccaall pprreeffiixx,, ee..gg..,, $$aarrgg__ffoooo

       Argument (parameter) "xyz".  If an "args" parameter is passed to a
       POE::Request constructor, its value must be a reference to a hash.
       Usually it's an anonymous hashref.  Anyway, the hash's members are
       named arguments to the message handler.  See above for an example.

       TThhee ""rreeqq__"" lleexxiiccaall pprreeffiixx,, ee..gg..,, $$rreeqq__ffoooo

       An incoming request may trigger more than one handler, especially if a
       POE::Stage object calls itself, or sends sub-requests to a helper
       stage.  The "req_" lexical prefix refers to data members within the
       current request's scope.  Their values will magically reflect the
       proper request scope, regardless what that is.

       TODO - Example.

       TThhee ""sseellff__"" lleexxiiccaall pprreeffiixx,, ee..gg..,, $$sseellff__ffoooo

       The "self" scope refers to the currently active POE::Stage object.
       Data may be stored there, in which case it's available from any and all
       requests handled by that object.  This scope is useful for "singleton"
       or static data that must be shared between or persistent between all
       requests.

       TODO - Example

       TThhee ""rrsspp__"" lleexxiiccaall pprreeffiixx,, ee..gg..,, $$rrsspp__ffoooo

       The "rsp" scope refers to data stored in a sub-request's scope, but
       from the response handler's point of view.  That is, when persisting
       data between a request to a substage and its response, one should store
       the data in the substage's request, then retrieve it later from the
       corresponding "rsp" variable.

       TODO - Example.

       TThhee $$sseellff, $req, and $rsp lexicals

       Certain variables are standard:  $self refers to the current object; it
       need not be initialized from @_.  $req refers to the higher-level
       request we're currently handling.  When handling responses from
       substages, $rsp refers to those responses.

       All three variables are intended as invocatnts for method calls.  Other
       prefixes exist to access data members within each object's scope.

       TODO - Example.

       The techniques used here have been abstracted and released as
       Lexical::Persistence.

HHAANNDDLLEERR NNAAMMIINNGG CCOONNVVEENNTTIIOONNSS
       Message handlers are defined in one of two ways.  They may be named
       anything as long as they have a :Handler attribute, or they may be
       prefixed with "on_".  In both cases, they gain lexical persistence
       magic, as discussed previously.

               # Handle the "foo" message.
               sub foo :Handler { ... }

               # Handle the "on_foo" and "foo" messages.
               sub on_foo { ... }

       The _o_n___f_o_o_(_) method above handles both "on_foo" and "foo" messages.
       Given both a _f_o_o_(_) and an _o_n___f_o_o_(_), however, _o_n___f_o_o_(_) will take
       precedence.

       Requests include on_* parameters that map response types to response
       handlers.  For example, this request expects two return types,
       "success" and "failure".  On success, the _h_a_n_d_l_e___s_u_c_c_e_s_s_(_) method is
       called.  On failure, _h_a_n_d_l_e___f_a_i_l_u_r_e_(_) is called.

               my $req_subrequest = POE::Request->new(
                       ...,
                       on_success => "handle_success",
                       on_failure => "handle_failure",
               );

       Response types are specified by the "type" parameter to $req->_e_m_i_t_(_)
       and $req->_r_e_t_u_r_n_(_).  "emit" and "return" are the default types for
       _e_m_i_t_(_) and _r_e_t_u_r_n_(_), respectively.

       Requests can also have roles, which are usually descriptive of the
       transaction.  For example, consider a DNS request for a web client
       component:

               my $req_resolve = POE::Request->new(
                       ...,
                       role => "resolver",
               );

       This is the role of the request, not of the stage that will handle it.
       In this case, there are no on_* parameters.  Success and failure come
       back to methods named "on_" . $request_role . "_" . $response_type.  In
       the previous example, they are:

               sub on_resolver_success { ... }
               sub on_resolver_failure { ... }

       When subclassing a POE::Stage class, it's sometimes useful to intercept
       _e_m_i_t_(_) and _r_e_t_u_r_n_(_) messages.  The subclass may implement handlers
       directly, or it may override or extend the response.  This is done by
       defining "on_my_" . $response_type methdos in the subclass.  For
       example, a TCP connection stage might emit an "input" event, like so:

               sub on_socket_readable {
                       ...;
                       $req->emit( type => "input", input => $data );
               }

       A subclass might implement the code to handle the input.  It can do so
       by defining _o_n___m_y___i_n_p_u_t_(_):

               sub on_my_input {
                       # send a response here
               }

       Messages intercepted like this will not be rethrown automatically to
       the caller.  If that's desired, _o_n___m_y___i_n_p_u_t_(_) will need to _e_m_i_t_(_) or

       TODO - Make a better example.  Something that can tie all these things
       together conceptually.
