=head1 NAME

podsection -- select sections from Module's POD

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 podsection [-h] [-u] ModuleName SectionName [SectionName ...]

For example:

 podsection Catalyst SYNOPSIS   # as text
 podsection Catalyst req res    # as text
 podsection -u Catalyst req res # as plain pod

Don't work with Some module:

 podsection CGI header # doesn't work correctly

Don't work with mixed level section:

 podsection Catalyst SYNOPSIS res  # only show one(in this case, show only SYNOPSIS)

Because Pod::Section only searches name in one level.
If in one level, one/some of them is/are found, it finishes to search.
