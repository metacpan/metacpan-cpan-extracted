	- Removed recursion from the Traceback function.  This was causing 
	  problems if the string was longer than 100 characters.  Added a test
	  for long strings.
0.04  Sat May 9 21:00:00 2009
	- Fixed a major bug in the calculation of the transcript.  The
          values for Deletion and Insertion should be checked prior to 
	  the values for Substitution and 'No action'.  I had this backwards
	  and my initial tests didn't catch it.  It was only when I compared
	  the values of 'GET' and 'POST' that I found the error.  Also updated
	  the tests to reflect the correct values.
0.05  Mon Oct 5 21:00:00 2009
	- Found a corner case where if the strings were of different length,
	  the basic traceback algorithm won't work.  Extended the algorithm
	  to work in this case.
