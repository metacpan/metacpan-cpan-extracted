=head1 NAME

KinoSearch::Highlight::Highlighter - Create and highlight excerpts.

=head1 DEPRECATED

The KinoSearch code base has been assimilated by the Apache L<Lucy> project.
The "KinoSearch" namespace has been deprecated, but development continues
under our new name at our new home: L<http://lucy.apache.org/>

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $highlighter = KinoSearch::Highlight::Highlighter->new(
        searcher => $searcher,
        query    => $query,
        field    => 'body'
    );
    my $hits = $searcher->hits( query => $query );
    while ( my $hit = $hits->next ) {
        my $excerpt = $highlighter->create_excerpt($hit);
        ...
    }



=head1 DESCRIPTION

The Highlighter can be used to select relevant snippets from a document,
and to surround search terms with highlighting tags.  It handles both stems
and phrases correctly and efficiently, using special-purpose data generated
at index-time.
