Business::ReportWriter 0.09
===========================

SYNOPSIS
The idea is to produce reports based on data that are extracted from a
database. The extraction is performed with DBIx::Recordset so the syntax
is the same as that package uses.

I include two sample XML files. The first file (trialbal.xml) is a report
for Trial Balance from the FreeMoney project.
The second (inventory.xml) is _very_ simple; it's only there to show
some of the basic posibilities in ReportWriter. Theres also a database
included. Fire it into PostgreSQL and run ReportWriter.

In the XML file there are sections for 
- Database. You'll want to change this to your settings
- Extraction criteria (The "search" section)
- Page header
- Breaks (this is where Report Writer will make a nice total for you)
- Fields
