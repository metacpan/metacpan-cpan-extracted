NAME
    Class::Adapter - Perl implementation of the "Adapter" Design Pattern

DESCRIPTION
    The "Class::Adapter" class is intended as an abstract base class for
    creating any sort of class or object that follows the *Adapter* pattern.

  What is an Adapter?
    The term *Adapter* refers to a *"Design Pattern"* of the same name, from
    the famous *"Gang of Four"* book *"Design Patterns"*. Although their
    original implementation was designed for Java and similar
    single-inheritance strictly-typed langauge, the situation for which it
    applies is still valid.

    An *Adapter* in this Perl sense of the term is when a class is created
    to achieve by composition (objects containing other object) something
    that can't be achieved by inheritance (sub-classing).

    This is similar to the *Decorator* pattern, but is intended to be
    applied on a class-by-class basis, as opposed to being able to be
    applied one object at a time, as is the case with the *Decorator*
    pattern.

    The "Class::Adapter" object holds a parent object that it "wraps", and
    when a method is called on the "Class::Adapter", it manually calls the
    same (or different) method with the same (or different) parameters on
    the parent object contained within it.

    Instead of these custom methods being hooked in on an object-by-object
    basis, they are defined at the class level.

    Basically, a "Class::Adapter" is one of your fall-back positions when
    Perl's inheritance model fails you, or is no longer good enough, and you
    need to do something twisty in order to make several APIs play nicely
    with each other.

  What can I do with the actual Class::Adapter class
    Well... nothing really. It exist to provide some extremely low level
    fundamental methods, and to provide a common base for inheritance of
    Adapter classes.

    The base "Class::Adapter" class doesn't even implement a way to push
    method calls through to the underlying object, since the way in which
    that happens is the bit that changes from case to case.

    To actually DO something, you probably want to go take a look at
    Class::Adapter::Builder, which makes the creation of *Adapter* classes
    relatively quick and easy.

METHODS
    The "Class::Adapter" class itself supplies only the two most common
    methods, a default constructor and a private method to access the
    underlying object.

  new $object
    The default "new" constructor takes a single object as argument and
    creates a new object which holds the passed object.

    Returns a new "Class::Adapter" object, or "undef" if you do not pass in
    an object.

  _OBJECT_
    The "_OBJECT_" method is provided primarily as a convenience, and a tool
    for people implementing sub-classes, and allows the "Class::Adapter"
    interface to provide a guarenteed correct way of getting to the
    underlying object, should you need to do so.
