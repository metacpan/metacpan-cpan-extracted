=head1 DESCRIPTION

A Remote object is a client-side representation of an object that
resides in a database.  It has the same fields as a normal object of
the same class - as declared in the Schema associated to the database
the Remote was obtained from.  The values of the fields are not normal
Perl values, but L<Tangram::Expr>s that will be evaluated on the
database server side.

Remote objects are somewhat similar to SQL table aliases.

Note that there are no objects which are actually C<Tangram::Remote>
instances; the objects will be called L<Tangram::Expr::QueryObject> et
al.
