RATIONALE
    The bundle is desgined for projects which are hosted on "github". More
    so, the project should have a "master" branch where you do code
    development, and a separete 'releases' branch which is where the *built*
    code is committed.

    Use of the Dist::Zilla::Plugin::MetaResourcesFromGit plugin creates
    links at CPAN which point to the GitHub pages (the wiki page is used as
    the default Homepage).

CONFIGURATION
    The package version is determined by the Git::NextVersion plugin; this
    can be overridden by setting the environment variable "V":

      V=1.000 dzil build ...

    If you provide the "no_cpan" option with a true value to the bundle, or
    set the environment variable "NO_CPAN" to a true value, then the upload
    to CPAN will be suppressed.

    If you provide a value to the "skip_deps" option then it will be passed
    to the "AutoPrereqs" Plugin as the "skip" attribute.

    If you provide a value to the "skip_files" option then it will be passed
    to the "PruneFiles" Plugin as the "match" attribute.

TIPS
    Do not include a "NAME", "VERSION", "AUTHOR" or "LICENSE" POD section in
    your code, they will be provided automatically.
