SNMP-LogParser

The SNMP-LogParser is one component script that allows to access log
file information via SNMP. 

The logparser script is used to incrementally parse log files.
The idea is that the log parser is invoked from Unix cron updating a stats file that
could then be tied easily into Net-SNMP (see http://www.net-snmp.org) by using the
SNMP-MibProxy module.

This module has bit of learning curve, you need to learn the methods of the base
class B<SNMP::LogParserDriver> and then implement an inherited class of
it to the parsing that you need.

Once you've learned it, you can do quick deployments of SNMP info gathered from
log files.

You have more examples of LogParser Drivers in the EXAMPLES directory

INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

    perl Build.PL
    ./Build
    ./Build test
    ./Build install
    ./Build install_system

The last command install_system will populate files in /etc and in /var if you have pernissions to do so.

Please be aware that the installation tries to write create the directories:
/etc/logparser, /var/log/logparser and /var/lib/logparser.
To change those directories please run:

    perl Build.PL --install_path etc=/etc/logparser --install_path log=/var/log/logparser --install_path work=/var/lib/logparser
