Revision history for DBIx-Class-Validation-Structure

0.15  2015-08-10 10:59:51 CDT
        - _val_text, _val_password & _val_number should not set default value to a blank string

          *Note:* This may cause breakage in some uses of this module because end users
          may have relied on this default value for their databases. Instead
          those users should set the `default_value` for those columns.

        - Use utf8 to include all letter characters in _val_text * _val_password
