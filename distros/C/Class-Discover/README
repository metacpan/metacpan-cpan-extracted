NAME
    Class::Discover - detect MooseX::Declare's 'class' keyword in files.

SYNOPSIS
DESCRIPTION
    This class is designed primarily for tools that whish to populate the
    "provides" field of META.{yml,json} files so that the CPAN indexer will
    pay attention to the existance of your classes, rather than blithely
    ignoring them.

    The version parsing is basically the same as what M::I's
    "->version_form" does, so should hopefully work as well as it does.

METHODS
  discover_classes
     Class::Discover->discover_classes(\%opts)

    Takes a single options hash-ref, and returns a array-ref of hashes with
    the following format:

     { MyClass => { file => "lib/MtClass.pm", type => "class", version => "1" } }

    "version" will only be present if the class has a (detected) version.
    "type" is the "keyword" match that triggered this class.

    The following options are understood:

    dir The (absolute) directory from which files should be given relative
        to. If "files" is not passed, then the dir under which to search for
        modules.

    files
        Array-ref of files in which to look. If provided, then only these
        files will be searched.

    keywords
        List of 'keywords' which are treated as being class declarators.
        Defaults to "class" and "role".

    no_index
        A hash of arrays with keys of "directory" and "file" which are
        ignored when searching for packages.

SEE ALSO
