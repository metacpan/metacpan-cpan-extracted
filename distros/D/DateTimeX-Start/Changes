Revision history for DateTimeX-Start

1.8.0   2025-01-05
        - Corrected the version of ExtUtils::MakeMaker that's required.

1.6.0   2016-11-01
        - Optimized based on the assumption that most calls will be for days
          with a midnight and only one midnight.
        - Now croaks rather than returning the wrong answer when a DateTime
          can't be found. This will never happen if the documented assumptions
          are correct.
        - Minor documentation improvements.

1.4.0   2016-10-31
        - Fix bug RT#118417 which could produce the wrong result when passing
          a DT object to start_of_day/day.

1.2.0   2016-05-09
        - Skip tests requiring newer DateTime::TimeZone than the one installed.
        - Fixes for "make disttest".
        - Documentation improvements.

1.0.0   2016-04-24
        - Initial version.
