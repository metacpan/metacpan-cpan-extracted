    UMLS-Interface REQUIRES that the following software packages and data:

  Programming Languages
     Perl (version 5.8.0 or better)

  CPAN Modules
     DBI
     DBD::mysql

INSTALLATION STAGES
    The installation is broken into five stages:
    Stage 1: Install Programming Languages
                  If already installed you need at minimum: 
                      - Perl version 5.8 or better

    Stage 2: Install CPAN Modules
    Stage 3: Install MySQL
                  If already installed you need at minimum: 
                      - MySQL version 5 or better

    Stage 4: Install the UMLS
                  If already installed you need at minimum: 
                      - the following files in the META directory:
                        -- populate_mysql_db.sh script 
                        -- MRREL.RFF
                        -- MRCONSO.RFF
                        -- MRSAB.RFF
                        -- MRDOC.RFF
                        -- MRDEF.RFF
                        -- MRSTY.RFF
                      - the following files in the NET directory
                            --populate_net_mysql_db.sh script
                            --SRDEF

    Stage 5: Load the UMLS into MySQL
                  If already installed you need at minimum: 
                      - the following tables 
                        -- MRREL
                        -- MRCONSO
                        -- MRSAB
                        -- MRDOC
                        -- SRDEF
                        -- MRDEF
                        -- MRSTY

    Stage 6: Install UMLS-Interface and set environment variable
        More details on how to obtain and install appear below.

Stage 1: Install Programming Languages, if already installed go to Stage 2
  Perl (version 5.8.5 or better)
    Perl is freely available at <http://www.perl.org>. It is very likely
    that you will already have Perl installed if you are using a Unix/Linux
    based system.

Stage 2 - Install CPAN modules, if already installed go to Stage 3
  DBI
    CPAN modules, and will not be repeated in detail for each module.****

    UMLS-Interface uses DBI to access the mysql database containing the
    UMLS. DBI is freely available at <http://search.cpan.org/~timb/DBI/>

    If you have supervisor access, or have configured MCPAN for local
    install, you can install via:

     perl -MCPAN -e shell
     > install DBI

    If not, you can, "manually" install by downloading the *.tar.gz file,
    unpacking, and executing the following commands.

     perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/home/programs LIB=/home/lib
     make
     make test
     make install

    Note that the PREFIX and LIB settings are just examples to help you
    create a local install, if you do not have supervisor (su) access.

    You must include /home/MyPerlLib in your PERL5LIB environment variable
    to access this module when running.

    UMLS-Interface uses this module to connect with umls installed on the
    mysql database. It is the MySQL sriver for the Perl5 Database interface.
    This package is freely available at
    <http://search.cpan.org/dist/DBD-mysql/>

    During a recent install there were some very very strange looking
    errors. These wereresolved after installing the Ubuntu package
    libmysqld-dev via

    sudo apt-get install libmysql-dev

    The following gives a little discussion about this situation :

    <http://www.dslreports.com/forum/r26750216-Can-t-install-the-DBD-mysql-p
    ackage-on-Ubuntu>

  Digest::SHA1
    UMLS-Interface uses Digest::SHA1 to conver the human readable tables
    names (the original one) to hex in order to keep the table names short
    while still having them contain all the relevant information. This
    pakcage is freely available at
    <http://search.cpan.org/~gaas/Digest-SHA1/>

  File::Spec
    UMLS-Interface uses this package for testing purposes. This package is
    freely available at:

    <http://search.cpan.org/~smueller/PathTools-3.31/lib/File/Spec.pm>

  File::Path
    UMLS-Interface uses this package for testing purposes. This package is
    freely available at:

    <http://search.cpan.org/~dland/File-Path-2.08/>

  Text::NSP
    UMLS-Interface uses this package to obtain the frequency counts for
    propagation. This package is freely available at:

    <http://search.cpan.org/dist/Text-NSP/>

Stage 3 - Install MySQL, if already installed go to Stage 4
    Requires MySQL (version 5 or better)

    MySQL is a freely available database at <http://www.mysql.com/>. You may
    be able to install this with you package manager. Otherwise you will
    have to download the appropriate files from the MySQL website. Either
    way, make certain that the following are installed:

            1. Server
            2. Client
            3. Shared libraries
            4. Headers and libraries

    Sometimes the headers and libraries are not installed so you want to
    double check on that.

  Installing on Red Hat Enterprise Linux WS release 4 using rpms
    I installed this on Red Hat Enterprise Linux WS release 4 using rpms.
    So, I downloaded the corresponding rpms:

            1. MySQL-server-community-5.0.51a-0.rhel4.i386.rpm
            2. MySQL-client-community-5.0.51a-0.rhel4.i386.rpm
            3. MySQL-shared-community-5.0.51a-0.rhel4.i386.rpm
            4. MySQL-devel-community-5.0.51a-0.rhel4.i386.rpm

    I ran into two problems. The first was I had an older version of RedHat
    that another program was dependent on and it would not let me upgrade. I
    ended up just removing the program and the older version of MySQL. This
    was not recommended by the MySQL documentation but after a certain point
    it just became too frustrating. The second problem that I had was I kept
    receiving the following error:

    Warning: Can't connect to local MySQL server through socket
    '/var/lib/mysql/mysql.sock' (2) in /var/www/html/forum/admin/
    db_mysql.php on line 40

    Warning: MySQL Connection Failed: Can't connect to local MySQL server
    through socket '/var/lib/mysql/mysql.sock' (2) in
    /var/www/html/forum/admin/db_mysql.php on line 40

    I don't completely understand this error but after much googling I ended
    up moving the mysql.sock file to the '/tmp' directory and changed the
    the socket location in my 'my.cnf' file which was located in the '/etc'
    directory. I changed the following line: from : socket =
    /var/lib/mysql/mysql.sock to : socket = /tmp/mysql.sock

    In the /var/lib/mysql/ directory I have a mysql.sock= file. I created a
    symbolic link to that from the /tmp directory

            ln -s /var/lib/mysql/mysql.sock= /tmp/mysql.sock

    Then everything seemed to work fine.

    I then set my root password:

         /usr/bin/mysqladmin -u root password 'new-password'

  Installing on Fedora using yum
    Ted installed mysql on Fedora using yum.

    To install mysql using yum, type the following three commands on the
    command line:

        1. yum install mysql
        2. yum install mysql-server
        3. yum install mysql-devel

    After this is complete mysql should be installed. Next you need to start
    the mysql server by typing the following command:

         service mysqld start

  Installing on Ubuntu using apt-get
    I also installed this on Ubuntu. This was 100 times easier than using
    the rpms! Type the following commands:

     sudo apt-get install mysql-common
     sudo apt-get install mysql-client
     sudo apt-get install mysql-server

    You are done - much easier!

  Reminder
    Also for all the installations, remember to set your root password:

         /usr/bin/mysqladmin -u root password 'new-password'

    If you are not going to be using root as your main entry into mysql -
    which is probably a good idea - you can create a user account. Here is
    how I did it:

     mysql> CREATE USER bthomson IDENTIFIED BY 'psswrd';
     Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

     mysql> GRANT ALL ON *.* TO bthomson;
     Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

    Directions are in the mysql documentation:

    <http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/adding-users.html>

Stage 4 - Install UMLS, if already installed go to Stage 5
  VERSION
    The UMLS-Interface requires version UMLS 2008AA or higher.

    Directionsmodified for installation version 2012AA.

  REMINDER
    If you already have the UMLS installed, make certain that you have the
    populate_mysql_db.sh script in the META directory as well as the
    MRREL.RFF, MRCONSO.RFF, MRSAB.RFF, MRDOC.RFF, MRDEF.RFF, MRSTY.RFF and
    SRDEF.RFF files. If you do not you will need to run the install program
    (MetamorphoSys) again.

  DESCRIPTION OF UMLS
    The UMLS is a freely available knowledge representation framework
    designed to support broad scope biomedical research queries. It includes
    over 100 controlled medical terminologies and classification systems
    encoded with different semantic and syntactic structures. The three
    major sources of UMLS are the Metathesaurus, Semantic Network and
    SPECIALIST Lexicon. To obtain the UMLS you need to register for a
    license. For more information please see:

    <http://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/>

    The UMLS is installed and the MySQL load scripts are created using
    MetamorphoSys. MetamorphoSys is the UMLS installation wizard and
    customization tool included in each UMLS release. It installs one or
    more of the UMLS Knowledge Sources; when the Metathesaurus is selected,
    the user can create customized Metathesaurus subsets. MetamorphoSys may
    be used to exclude vocabularies that are not required or licensed for
    use in local applications and to select from a variety of data output
    options and filters. Below are directions for a basic installation -
    nothing fancy.

    There are quite a few steps and substeps here. The steps aren't
    complicated - there are just a lot of different windows that pop up and
    I tried to break it down into small steps so I wouldn't miss anything.
    The directions can also be found with in the UMLS documentation:

    <http://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/load_scripts.html>
    <http://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/meta6.html>

  Step 1: Download the UMLS
    The UMLS is freely available but you need to register for a UMLS license
    prior to downloading.

    You can register here:

    <http://umlsks.nlm.nih.gov/>

    The download link is here:

    <http://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/>

     Download the following files:
      1. <current release>-1-meta.nlm  
      2. <current release>-otherks.nlm    
      3. <current release>-2-meta.nlm  
      4. mmsys.zip    
      5. <current release>.CHK  
      6. Copyright_Notice.txt  
      7. README.txt

  Step 2: Unzip the mmsys.zip file (unzip mmsys.zip)
    The following should be created: 1. linux_mmsys.sh 2. solaris_mmsys.sh
    3. macintosh_mmsys.sh 4. windows_mmsys.bat 5. MMSYS/ (directory)

  Step 3: Run MetamorphoSys (the install wizard)
     -- Run the appropriate .sh file for your system 
         --> I ran ./run_linux.sh

     -- Click 'Install UMLS'

     -- INSTALL UMLS' Window will appear
        - Type in your destination directory. I used 
          the same directory as my Source.
        - At the very least make certain that the Metathesaurus 
          box is checked. Although, I installed all three of the 
          Knowledge Sources: 'Metathesaurus', 'Semantic 
          Network' and 'SPECIALIST Lexicon and Lexical Tools'.
        - Choose the mysql database for the Semantic Network load
          scripts    
        - Click 'OK'

     -- 'Install UMLS' and 'MetamorphoSys Configuration' windows will appear
         - Click 'New Configuration' in the 'MetamorphoSys Configuration' 

     -- 'License Agreement Notice' window will appear
         - Click 'Accept'

     -- 'Select Default Subset' window will appear
         - Click 'Level 0 + SNOMEDCT'               
         - Unless you don't want or do not have a license for 
           SNOMED-CT. then Click 'Level 0'
         - Click 'Done'

     -- 'UMLS Metathesaurus Configuration' window will appear
         - Click on the 'Output Options' tab
         - Check the 'Write MySQL load script' box 
         - this is under the heading 'Write Database Load Scripts'
       - Click 'Done' and then 'Begin Subset'
         - this is the last option on the list of options in the 
           top left hand corner of the window. 
       - A box will appear asking if you would save the changes 
         - this is up to you; I clicked 'No'

         Now the UMLS will install and the load scripts will be created 

     -- 'Finished' window will appear
        - Click 'Done'

Stage 5 - Load UMLS into MySQL, if already installed go to Stage 6
  Step 1: Create the MySQL database
    Log into MySQL and create a database called 'umls' as follows:

    CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS umls CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_unicode_ci;
    

  Step 2: Modify the 'my.cnf' file.
    This has been put in a different place every version or distribution
    that I have run this one. I have found it in the '/etc' directory as
    well as the '/etc/mysql' directory.

    You can find where yours is by using the find command:

        sudo find / -name my.cnf

    If you do not have a my.cnf file check to see if you have a 'my.ini'
    file (which one you have will depend on your system).

    The following options need to be modified to optimize for read
    performance, the MySQL 5 server requires changing buffer sizes to make
    use of the memory available.

          key_buffer              = 600M
          table_cache             = 300
          sort_buffer_size        = 20M
          read_buffer_size        = 200M
          query_cache_limit       = 3M
          query_cache_size        = 100M
          myisam_sort_buffer      = 200M
          bulk_insert_buffer_size = 100M
          join_buffer_size        = 100M

    Also make certain that this file is readable in order to run this as
    non-root. To change permission on it: chmod gou+r /etc/my.cnf

  Step 3: Populate the MySQL table using the load scripts
   Step A: Find the MySQL load script for the Metathesaurus
    Go to your Destination directory that you typed in Step C (this is where
    I said my source and destination directory were the same)

    Go to the: <destination>/2008AA/META directory

     In it you should see the file:

       populate_mysql_db.sh

    If you don't see this file - you need to start over. Step 3 - F did not
    get done properly.

   Step B: Modify the MySQL load scripts for the Metathesaurus
    In the populate_mysql_db.sh you need to modify the following:

            MYSQL_HOME=<path to MYSQL_HOME>
            user=<username>
            password=<password>
            db_name=<db_name>

    For example, I modified my file as follows:

            MYSQL_HOME=/usr/
            user=bthomson
            password=<well I am not giving you my actual password>
            db_name=umls

   Step C:  Run the MySQL load scripts for the Metathesaurus
    Run this script by typing on the command line:

            ./populate_mysql_db.sh

    If you get the following:

            ./populate_mysql_db.sh: Permission denied.

    You need to change your permissions and try again. To change your
    permissions type:

            chmod 755 populate_mysql_db.sh

    Now this takes what feels like FOREVER! Now would be a good time to go
    do something else until sometime late tomorrow (yes, unfortunately,
    tomorrow) evening ...

    Note: different distributions set up mysql just a bit differently, and
    one area that seems to matter to UMLS is whether or not "load local
    infile" is enabled. I think normally it is, but openSuse does not enable
    that by default. So, statement 15 in mysql_tables.sql was
    failing...which caused the populate script to end immediately...

    To overcome this, modify the my.cnf file to include

    [client] loose-local-infile=1

    This information comes from the following:

    <http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/load-data-local.html>

   Step D: Find the MySQL load script for the Semantic Network
    Go to your Destination directory that you typed in Step C (this is where
    I said my source and destination directory were the same)

    Go to the: <destination>/2008AA/NET

    In it you should see the file:

        LoadScripts.zip

    Unzip this file as follows:

        unzip LoadScripts.zip

    The following file then should appear:

        populate_net_mysql_db.sh

    If you don't see this file - you need to start over. Step 3 - F did not
    get done properly.

   Step E: Modify the MySQL load script for the Semantic Network
    This is the exact same modifications that were done in the Metathesaurus
    load script.

    In the populate_net_mysql_db.sh you need to modify the following:

        MYSQL_HOME=<path to MYSQL_HOME>
        user=<username>
        password=<password>
        db_name=<db_name>

    For example, I modified my file as follows:

        MYSQL_HOME=/usr/
        user=bthomson
        password=<well I am not giving you my actual password>
        db_name=umls

   Step F:  Run the MySQL load script for the Semantic Network
    Run this script by typing on the command line:

        ./populate_net_mysql_db.sh

    If you get the following:

        ./populate_net_mysql_db.sh: Permission denied.

    You need to change your permissions and try again. To change your
    permissions type:

        chmod 755 populate_net_mysql_db.sh

    Now this should not take forever. It goes much much quicker!

  Step G: Modify the my.cnf file (again)
    This has been put in a different place every version or distribution
    that I have run this one. I have found it in the '/etc' directory as
    well as the '/etc/mysql' directory.

    You can find where yours is by using the find command:

        sudo find / -name my.cnf

    This time you are modifying it so the that the UMLS-Interface package
    (and the utils/ files) can automatically log into the umls database.

        [client]
        user            = <username>
        password        = <password>
        port            = 3306
        socket          = /tmp/mysql.sock
        database        = umls

    The port number is should already be in the my.cnf file under the
    [mysql] heading. I just copied and pasted that.

    The socket is what ever socket you used in Stage 3.

    Remember we discussed how big of pain this was since it seemed like the
    socket location depended on what operating system you were using.

    My RedHat is:

        socket = /tmp/mysql.sock

    where as on my Ubunutu 8.04:

        socket = /var/lib/mysql/mysql.sock

    and currently on Ubuntu 9.04:

        socket = /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock

    So the sock file is different and its location is different depending on
    what version of linux you are running.

    You can find it using:

         sudo find / -name mysqld.sock 

         or

         sudo find / -name mysql.sock

    This is a huge pain. If you need help just send me an email.

    The database is whatever you called the database that the UMLS is
    installed in. Mine is 'umls'.

    Also again remember to make certain that this file is readable in order
    to run this as non-root user. To change permission on it:

          chmod gou+r /etc/my.cnf

Stage 6 - Install UMLS-Interface and set environment variable
    The usual way to install the package is to run the following commands:

         perl Makefile.PL
         make
         make test
         make install

    You will often need root access/superuser privileges to run make
    install. The module can also be installed locally. To do a local
    install, you need to specify a PREFIX option when you run 'perl
    Makefile.PL'. For example,

     perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/home

     or

     perl Makefile.PL LIB=/home/lib PREFIX=/home

    will install UMLS-Interface into /home. The first method above will
    install the modules in /home/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.8.3 (assuming you are
    using version 5.8.3 of Perl; otherwise, the directory will be slightly
    different). The second method will install the modules in /home/lib. In
    either case the executable scripts will be installed in /home/bin and
    the man pages will be installed in home/share.

    Warning: do not put a dash or hyphen in front of PREFIX, LIB or WNHOME.

    In your perl programs that you may write using the modules, you may need
    to add a line like so

     use lib '/home/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.8.3';

    if you used the first method or

     use lib '/home/lib';

    if you used the second method. By doing this, the installed modules are
    found by your program. To run the umls-similarity.pl program, you would
    need to do

     perl -I/home/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.8.3 umls-similarity.pl

     or

     perl -I/home/lib

    Of course, you could also add the 'use lib' line to the top of the
    program yourself, but you might not want to do that. You will need to
    replace 5.8.3 with whatever version of Perl you are using. The preceding
    instructions should be sufficient for standard and slightly non-standard
    installations. However, if you need to modify other makefile options you
    should look at the ExtUtils::MakeMaker documentation. Modifying other
    makefile options is not recommended unless you really, absolutely, and
    completely know what you're doing!

    NOTE: If one (or more) of the tests run by 'make test' fails, you will
    see a summary of the tests that failed, followed by a message of the
    form "make: *** [test_dynamic] Error Y" where Y is a number between 1
    and 255 (inclusive). If the number is less than 255, then it indicates
    how many test failed (if more than 254 tests failed, then 254 will still
    be shown). If one or more tests died, then 255 will be shown. For more
    details, see:

    <http://search.cpan.org/dist/Test-Simple/lib/Test/Builder.pm#EXIT_CODES>

    If desired, you can set the UMLSINTERFACE_CONFIGFILE_DIR environment
    variable. This will be the location where you don't mind the
    UMLS-Interface module writing out system files when using the verbose
    option. The files created when using this option are:

           1. <UMLS_version>_<sources><relations>_config

              which is an example configuration file of the 
              the current run

           2. <UMLS_version>_<sources><relations>_child
              <UMLS_version>_<sources><relations>_parent

              this files store the upper level taxonomy which is 
              created when connecting multiple sources

           3. <UMLS_version>_<sources><relations>_table

    They are primarily for testing purposes.
