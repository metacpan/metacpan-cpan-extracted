XML::GXML Readme
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Thanks for your interest in GXML. GXML is a transformation tool for
XML, allowing you to process XML code in many ways. It's like XSLT in
purpose, but much simpler to learn and get started with. While simpler
than XSLT, GXML has features powerful enough for many tasks, comes in
an easy-to-use package, and is highly extensible for special tasks.

These are GXML's high-level features:

*  Template substitution for any given element.
*  Templates may be provided by user code or files on disk.
*  Any part of the XML, source or template, may contain variables
   which will be substituted according to well-defined rules.
*  Variable values may be: things embedded in an enclosing element's
   start tag, other elements in scope, sub-values of an in-scope
   element, or provided by user code.
*  Element tags can have variables in them.
*  Special commands allow conditionals and looping, e.g. "if exists,"
   "if equals," and "foreach."
*  User can specify callbacks for start and/or end of given tags.
*  Element tags can be easily remapped to other things.
*  XML syntax can be easily translated into HTML syntax.

GXML is an outgrowth of gxml2html, my tool for converting web sites
written in XML to HTML output. gxml2html is now "just another
application" that uses the GXML engine to do its work.
