# ----- Example 9 - Filtering PDF with "prog" -------
#
#  Please see the swish-e documentation for
#  information on configuration directives.
#  Documentation is included with the swish-e
#  distribution, and also can be found on-line
#  at http://swish-e.org
#
#
#  This example demonstrates how to use swish's
#  "prog" document source feature to filter documents.
#
#  The "prog" document source feature allows
#  an external program to feed documents to
#  swish, one after another.  This allows you
#  to index documents from any source (e.g. web, DBMS)
#  and to filter and adjust the content before swish
#  indexes the content.
#
#  Using the "prog" method to filter documents requires more
#  work to set up than using the "filters" described in
#  example8.config because you must write a program to retrieve
#  the documents and feed them to swish.
#
#  On the otherhand, the "prog" method should be faster than the
#  filter method in example8.config because swish doesn't need to fork
#  itself and run an external program for each document to filter.
#  This can be significant if you are using a perl script as a filter since
#  the perl script must be compiled each time it is run.  This "prog" method
#  avoides that overhead.
#
#  This example uses the example9.pl program.  This program
#  is very similar to the included DirTree.pl program found in
#  the prog-bin directory.  This program simple reads files from the
#  file system, and passes their content onto swish if they are the correct
#  type.  PDF files are converted by the prog-bin/pdf2xml.pm module.
#
#  The PDF info fields (e.g. author)  are placed in xml tags
#  which allows indexing the PDF info as MetaNames.
#  By specifying metanemes you can limit searches by this PDF info.
#
#  For this example, you will need the xpdf package.
#  Type "perldoc pdf2xml" from the prog-bin directory for
#  more information.
#
#  Run this example as:
#
#     swish-e -S prog -c example9.config
# 
#---------------------------------------------------

# Include our site-wide configuration settings:
IncludeConfigFile example4.config


# Define the program to run
IndexDir ./example9.pl


# Pass in the top-level directory to index
# (here we specify the current directory)
SwishProgParameters .


# Swish can index a number of different types of documents.
# .config are text, and .pdf are converted (filtered) to xml:
IndexContents TXT .config
IndexContents XML .pdf


# Since the pdf2xml module generates xml for the PDF info fields and
# for the PDF content, let's use MetaNames
# Instead of specifying each metaname, let's let swish do it automatically.
UndefinedMetaTags auto
