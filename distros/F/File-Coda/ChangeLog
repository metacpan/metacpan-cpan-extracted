2009-12-11  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	Version 1.91
	* Coda.pm (VERSION): Increment.

	Version 1.10

2009-12-10  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	tests: work around difference in Solaris' spelling of strerror(EBADF)

	Version 1.9
	* Coda.pm ($VERSION): Increase to 1.9.

2009-11-30  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	make t/01 work even without /dev/full
	* t/01-basic.t: Without /dev/full, just skip that sub-test.

	make t/02 work even without /dev/full
	* t/02-noclobber.t: Eliminate FIXME: provoke failure
	with closed stdout rather than relying on /dev/full.

2009-11-29  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	doc: say that we use "warn" for the diagnostic
	* Coda.pm: Say that we use "warn", rather than mentioning STDERR.
	Mention that "1" is just the default exit status.

2009-11-28  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	Coda.pm: fix a subtle taint-related bug
	* Coda.pm: Don't use $ME (aka $0) *inside* double quotes.
	Its taintedness in that context would cause $! to expand to a
	number rather than to a string, thus making tests 01 and 02 fail.
	* t/01-basic.t: Reenable taint-checking, now that the
	problem is resolved.
	* t/02-noclobber.t: Likewise.

2009-11-27  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

2007-02-11  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Version 1.4.
	* Coda.pm ($VERSION): Increase to 1.4.

	* Makefile.PL (WriteMakefile): Use gzip's --rsyncable option,
	if possible.

	* t/0*.t: Use "$ENV{LC_ALL} = 'C';".  That is simpler,
	should work just as well, and may even be more portable.

	Use setlocale to ensure we get English diagnostics.
	* t/01basic.t, t/02noclobber.t, t/03nointerfere.t: Use setlocale,
	in case the system default language is not "C" or en_*.
	This is necessary for some MacOS X configurations.
	Also fix typo: s/email line/stderr line/.
	Suggestions from Ed Santiago.

2007-01-19  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Version 1.3.
