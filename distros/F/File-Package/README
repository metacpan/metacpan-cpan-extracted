DESCRIPTION
    In a perfect Perl, everything would behave exactly the same running
    under "eval". Many times the reason to use an "eval" is the anticipation
    that the expression may die. When that happens, a perfect Perl would
    have deposited all the output fromm the "warn" and "die" in "$@". Maybe
    you have a perfect Perl. However, it is shocking that there are some
    Perls on some platforms out in the wild that are mutants and are not
    perfect.

    A "require" under eval works just fine just to see if a program will
    load or not. If working locally, you can simply devise a quick debug
    setup and track down the problem. However, when running tests remotely,
    on different remote platforms, running continuously unattended where
    uptime is important, or any number of situations it is very helpful to
    have meaningful error messages when a problem arise.

    Thus, the reason to run under "eval" is not only to avoid the "die" but
    also to pick up the error message returned by "eval" in "$@". In certain
    situations it is extremely critical to obtain reliable error messages
    when a failure occurs.

    Well, a "eval "require $program_module"" failure returns a reasonble
    looking "$@" except for one small thing. Not all the warnings make it to
    "$@" at least on one Perl, probably more. And there can be quite a few
    warnings when loading a broken program module. It would be nice if
    everyone could update to a Perl where the "eval" deposits all the
    warnings in "$@". But as the acient proverb says, "If wishes were
    horses, beggers would ride.".

    One workaround is to catch the warnings with "$SIG{__WARN__}" when
    running the "require" under a "eval". This collects all the warnings
    which is good. Now when a load fails, the program does not die, it
    gracefully collects all the warnings and logs them or ships back.

    Now try the "import" under "eval" and pick up the error messages. The
    "import" and "eval" is big time "failure to communicate" aka the movie
    "Cool Hand Luke". The "import" uses the caller stack to determine where
    to stuff the symbols and there is a lot of "Carp" "croak" gyrations such
    as making "import" look like "use", trapping "warnings" and "dies". The
    "eval" takes off on its own caller stack which to quote President Bush:
    "is not helpful".

    The "import" uses the "croak" instead of "die" directly or else any
    efforts to get meaningfull error messages would be dead on arrival. Perl
    is designed so that it is nearly impossible to avoid a die unless
    running under a "eval". A workaround is hooking in a "croak" that does
    not die and collecting the error messages.

Subroutines
  is_package_loaded

     $package = is_package_loaded($program_module, $package)

    The "is_package_loaded" subroutine determines if the "$package" is
    present and the "$progarm_module" loaded. If "$package" is absent, 0 or
    '', "$package" is set to the "program_module".

  load_package

      $error = load_package($program_module, @import, [@package_list]);

    The "load_package" subroutine attempts to capture any load problems by
    loading the package with a "require " under an eval and capturing all
    the "warn" and $@ messages.

    If the "$program_module" load is successful, the checks that the
    packages in the @package list are present. If @package list is absent,
    the "$program_module" uses the "program_module" name as a list of one
    package. Although a program module and package have the same name
    syntax, they are entirely different. A program module is a file. A
    package is a hash of symbols, a symbol table. The Perl convention is
    that the names for each are the same which enhances the appearance that
    they are the same when in fact they are different. Thus, a program
    module may have a single package with a different name or many different
    packages.

    Finally the "$program_module" subroutine will import the symbols in the
    "@import" list. If "@import" is absent "$program_module" subroutine does
    not import any symbols; if "@import" is '', all symbols are imported. A
    "@import" of 0 usually results in an "$error".

    The "$program_module" traps all load errors and all import "Carp::Crock"
    errors and returns them in the "$error" string.

    One very useful application of the "load_package" subroutine is in test
    scripts. If a package does load, it is very helpful that the program
    does not die and reports the reason the package did not load. This
    information is readily available when loaded at a local site. However,
    it the load occurs at a remote site and the load crashes Perl, the
    remote tester usually will not have this information readily available.

    Other applications include using backup alternative software if a
    package does not load. For example if the package 'Compress::Zlib' did
    not load, an attempt may be made to use the gzip system command.

BUGS
    The "load_package" cannot load program modules whose name contain the
    '-' characters. The 'eval' function used to trap the die errors believes
    it means subtraction.

QUALITY ASSURANCE
    Running the test script "package.t" verifies the requirements for this
    module.

    The <tmake.pl> cover script for Test::STDmaker automatically generated
    the "package.t" test script, "package.d" demo script, and
    "t::File::Package" STD program module POD, from the "t::File::Package"
    program module contents. The "t::File::Package" program module is in the
    distribution file File-Package-$VERSION.tar.gz.

1.0 SCOPE
    This paragraph identifies and provides an overview of the released
    files.

  1.1 Identification

    This release, identified in 3.2, is a collection of Perl modules that
    extend the capabilities of the Perl language.

  1.2 System overview

    One very useful test of the installation of a package is whether or not
    the package loaded. If it did not load, the reason it did not load is
    helpful diagnostics and may be used to programically (automatically)
    take corrective action.

    The load_package method attempts to capture any load problems by loading
    the package with a "require " under an eval and capturing all the "warn"
    and $@ messages. The error messages are returned with a warn instead of
    die so that the using program may take the appropriate action such as
    reporting the errors back to the author when used in test software or
    perhaps falling back on a system 'gzip' command when the
    'Compress::Zlib' module fails to load.

  1.3 Document overview.

  3.3 Changes

    The file names from 0.05 were changed as follows:

     return if $file =~ s=lib/File/FileUtil.pm=lib/File/Package.pm=;
     return if $file =~ s=t/File/FileUtil/FileUtil.t=t/File/package.t=;

    Changes to past revisions are as follows:

    Test-TestUtil-0.01
        Originated

    Test-TestUtil-0.02
        Correct failure from Josts Smokehouse"
        <Jost.Krieger+smokeback@ruhr-uni-bochum.de> test run

        t/Test/TestUtil/TestUtil....Bareword "fspec_dirs" not allowed while
        "strict subs" in use at

          /net/sunu991/disc1/.cpanplus/5.8.0/build/Test-TestUtil-0.01/blib/lib/Test/TestUtil.pm line 56.

        Changed line 56 from

         my @dirs = (fspec_dirs) ? $from_package->splitdir( $fspec_dirs ) : ();

        to

         my @dirs = ($fspec_dirs) ? $from_package->splitdir( $fspec_dirs ) : ();

        This error is troublesome since the test passed on my system using
        Active Perl under Microsoft NT. It should never have passed. This
        error is in a core method, *fspec2fspec*, that changes file
        specifications from one operating system to another operating
        system. This method has been in service unchanged for some time.

    Test-TestUtil-0.03
        Correct failure from Josts Smokehouse"
        <Jost.Krieger+smokeback@ruhr-uni-bochum.de> test run

        PERL_DL_NONLAZY=1 /usr/local/perl/bin/perl "-MExtUtils::Command::MM"
        "-e" "test_harness(0, 'blib/lib', 'blib/arch')"
        t/Test/TestUtil/TestUtil.t t/Test/TestUtil/TestUtil....# Test 18
        got: '$VAR1 = ''; ' (t/Test/TestUtil/TestUtil.t at line 540 fail
        #17) # Expected: '$VAR1 = '\\=head1 Title Page

        The *pm2datah* method is not returning any data for Test 18. This
        will also cause the test of *pm2data*, test 19 to fail. The
        *pm2datah* is searching for the string "\n__DATA__\n".

        The "\n" character on Perl is a logical end of line character
        sequence. The "\n" end of line is different on Mr. Smokehouse's Unix
        operating system than on my Windows NT operating system. The test
        file was created under MSWin32 and uses a MSWin32 "\n". Under UNIX,
        *pm2datah* method will look for the Unix "\n" and there will not be
        any.

        Changed "\n__DATA__\n" to /[\012\015]__DATA__/.

        During the clean-up for CPAN, broke the *format_hash_table* method
        for tables in hash of hash format. Fixed the break, added test 29 to
        the *t/Test/TestUtil/TestUtil.t* test script for this feature, and
        added a discusssion of this feature in POD discription for

    Test-TestUtil-0.04
        item our old friend visits again - DOS and UNIX text file
        incompatibility

        This impacts other modules. We have to examine all modules for this
        portability defect and correct any found defects.

        Correct failure from Josts Smokehouse"
        <Jost.Krieger+smokeback@ruhr-uni-bochum.de> and Kingpin
        <mthurn@carbon> test runs.

        On Mr. Smokehouse's run email the got: VAR1 clearly showed extra
        white space line that is not present in the expected: VAR1. In Mr.
        Kingpin's run the got: VAR1 and expected: VAR1 look visually the
        same. However, the Unix found a difference(s) and failed the test.

        For Mr. Smokehouse's run:

        PERL_DL_NONLAZY=1 /usr/local/bin/perl "-MExtUtils::Command::MM" "-e"
        "test_harness(0, 'blib/lib', 'blib/arch')"

        What we have before, was a totally "failure to communicate." aka
        Cool Hand Luke. VAR1 was empty. Now VAR1 has something. It is not
        completely dead. One probable cause is the Unix operating system
        must be producing two Unix \012 new lines for a Microsoft single
        newline \015\012. Without being able to examine the test with a
        debugger, the only way to verify this is to provide the fix and see
        if the problem goes away when this great group of testers try for
        the fourth time.

        Revised *fin* method to take a handle, change *pm2datah* method
        handle, *$fh*, to binary by adding a *binmode $fh* statement, and
        pass the actual thru the *fin* method for test 18.

        Use *fin($fh)* to read in the data for *pm2data*, test 19 Unit Under
        Test (UUT), instead of using the raw file handle.

        The *fin* method takes any \015\012 combination and changes it into
        the logical Perl new line, *"\n"*, for the current operating system.

            that I would like you to reconsider is the naming of
            "Test::TestUtil" respectively "Test::Tech" - neither of those is
            descriptive of what the routines actually do or what the module
            implements. I would recommend renaming them to something closer
            to your other modules, maybe "Test::SVDMaker::Util" and
            "Test::SVDMaker::Tech", as some routines do not seem to be
            specific to the Test::-suite but rather general
            (format_array_table). Some parts (the "scrub" routines) might
            even better live in another module namespace,
            "Test::Util::ScrubData" or something like that.

            Broke away all the file related methods from Test::TestUtil and
            created this module File::FileUtil so the module name is more
            descriptive of the methods within the module.

        *   Broke the smart nl code out of the fin method and made it is own
            separate method, smart_nl method.

            At 02:44 AM 6/14/2003 +0200, Max Maischein wrote: Perl, as Perl
            already does smart newline handling, (even though with the
            advent of 5.8 even Unix-people have to learn the word "binmode"
            now :-))

            The only place where I see Perl does smart newline handling is
            the crlf IO displine introduce in Perl 5.6. The File::FileUtil
            has a use 5.001 so that 5.6 Perl built-ins cannot be used. Added
            comment to smart_nl that for users with 5.6 Perl that it may be
            better to use the built-in crlf IO discipline.

        *   For the load_package method that uses a eval "require $package"
            to load the package, the $@ does not capture all the warnings
            and error messages, at least not with ActiveState Perl. Added
            code the captures also the warnings, by temporaily reassigning
            $SIG(__WARN__), and added these to the $@ error messages.

        *   Added two new tests to verify the NOGO paths for the for the
            load_package method. One tests for load module failure looking
            for all the possilbe information on why the module did not load.
            The other verifies that the vocabulary is present after the
            loading the module. This information is very helpful when you
            must remote debug a load failure from CPAN testing whose is
            running on a different platform.

    File-FileUtil-0.02
        Added the method *hex_dump*.

    File-FileUtil-0.03
        test_lib2inc
            Returns to parent directory of the first t directory going up
            from the test script instead of the t directory.

        find_t_roots
            Added the function find_t_roots that returns the parent
            directory of all the directories in @INC

    File-Package-0.01
        Removed the methods for loading a program module with the same name
        from the "File::FileUtil" module to their own module "File::Package"
        module. The module name is now much more descriptive of the routines
        in the module.

    File-Package-0.02
        Replace the obsolete "File::FileUtil" with File::Packgage in the
        test script "t\File\package.t".

    File-Package-0.03
        Added subroutine interfaces.

        Added @import input to load_packages method

    File-Package-0.04
        Upgraded the 'tlib\Test\Tech' and changed the name of
        'tlib\Data\strify' to 'tlib\Data\Secs2'. The new name is more
        self-explanatory.

    File-Package-0.05
        The lastest build of Test::STDmaker expects the test library in the
        same directory as the test script. Coordiated with the lastest
        Test::STDmaker by moving the test library from tlib to t/File, the
        same directory as the test script and deleting the test library
        File::TestPath program module.

    File-Package-0.06
        Added "Carp::longmess", that dumps the call stack, to the
        Carp::croak trap function.

    File-Package-0.07
        Expanded the description.

        Under the Perl 5.6, Microsoft distribute, "Carp" program module,
        "import" sends warings out using "&Carp::carp" function as well as
        "Carp::croak" function. Adjust to also pick up these messages.

        Right click on 'File-Package-0.06.tar.gz' and download to a
        temporary installation directory. Enter the following where $make is
        'nmake' for microsoft windows; otherwise 'make'.

         gunzip File-Package-0.06.tar.gz
         tar -xf File-Package-0.06.tar

  3.7 Possible problems and known errors

    There is still much work needed to ensure the quality of this module as
    follows:

    *   State the functional requirements for each method including not only
        the GO paths but also what to expect for the NOGO paths

    *   All the tests are GO path tests. Should add NOGO tests.

    *   Add the requirements addressed as *# R: * comment to the tests
