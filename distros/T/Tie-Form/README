NAME
    Tie::Form - access a machine readable database file that minics a
    hardcopy form

SYNOPSIS
     require Tie::Form;

     #####
     # Using support methods and file handle with
     # the file subroutines such as open(), readline()
     # print(), close()
     #
     tie *FORM_FILEHANDLE, 'Tie::Form', @options
     $form = tied \*FORM_FILEHANDLE; 

     #####
     # Using support methods only, no file subroutines
     # 
     $form = Tie::Form->new(@options);

     \$encoded_fields  = $form->decode_record(\$record); 
     \@fields          = $form->decode_field(\$encoded_fields);

     \$encoded_fields  = $form->encode_field (\@fields);
     \$record          = $form->encode_record(\$encoded_fields);

     $record           = $form->get_record();

     ####
     # Subroutine interface
     #
     \$encoded_fields  = decode_record(\$record); 
     \@fields          = decode_field(\$encoded_fields);

     \$encoded_fields  = encode_field (\@fields);
     \$record          = encode_record(\$encoded_fields);

    If a subroutine or method will process a list of options, "@options",
    that subroutine will also process an array reference, "\@options",
    "[@options]", or hash reference, "\%options", "{@options}".

DESCRIPTION
    The "Tie::Form" module provides a text database file suitable for local
    data such as private mailing lists. The "Tie::Form" cannot provide a
    data warehouse shared by mulitple users.

  File format description

    Desireable goals for small local private databases file format are as
    follows:

    *   The database is a text file that can be edited with a simple text
        editor. How many times have a basebase been corrupted and the data
        cannot be recoveried? For most people many times. One time is one
        time too many

    *   The text format resembles as much as possible the standard forms
        that all civilized people must from time to time fill out in order
        to survive in a civilized society. Forms are a necessary evil in the
        pursue of happiness, freedom and prosperity in a civilized society.
        An example of a form is as follows:

          manhood length: ________
          time spent in big house: _________
          what drugs do you use: _________

        Notice the applicant is not required to specify the form data using
        Perl hash notation such as

          manhood_length => 2

        By the way, that would be your entry. My entry would be

          manhood_length => 22

        The political incorrect NH live free or die response would be

          manhood length: come up to my place and I'll show you
          time spent in big house: none of your business
          what drugs do you use: put it where the sun doesn't shine

        The feds response to NH: no federal funding.

    *   The record separator, field separator and any other separator is
        unique and not embedded in the data. With unique separators, various
        components of the database may be accessed with simple file read and
        write functions. There is no need to buffer and process the data to
        determine if the separator is really a separtor or part of the data.

    *   The format has simple, straightforward method of escaping separators
        when they are embedded in the data. Escape techiques such as the
        back-slash besides causing blurred vision also leave the separator
        embedded in the data. Try looking at the output of the metachar()
        function and then try to read a eye chart. This is totally
        unacceptable not only because it impairs vision but also for poor
        computation performance.

    The Tie::Form program module solution is to use separators of the
    following form:

     (not_the_char) . (char) . (not_the_char)

    The separators are escaped in embedded text by adding a extra (char) as
    follows:

     sequence             escaped

     [^$c]$c[^c]          [^$c]$c$c[^c]
     [^$c]$c$c[^c]        [^$c]$c$c$c[^c]

                     ...

     [^$c]$c x n[^c]      [^$c]$c($c x n)[^c]

SUBROUTINES
    This package inherits most of its Tie methods from the Tie::Layers
    package.

    The methods specific to this package are to encode and decode fields and
    records, and to put and get records as follows:

  TIEHANDLE

     tie *FORM_FILEHANDLE, 'Tie::Form', @options
     tie *FORM_FILEHANDLE, 'Tie::Form', \@options
     tie *FORM_FILEHANDLE, 'Tie::Form', \%options
     $form = tied \*FORM_FILEHANDLE; 

    The "TIEHANDLE" method supports the "tie" Perl built-in subroutine. The
    "$form" object created by "tie" may be used to access the functions that
    are in addition to the those established in Tie Handle Perl
    specification. The available options are as follows:

     option      description
     ---------------------------
     EON         End of Name field termination separator
     EOD         End of Data field termination separator
     EOR         End of Record termination separator
     strict      strict processing of EON and EOD

    Typically "EON", "EOD", "EOR" should be read-only. The requirements for
    these options are very specific.

  encode_field

     \$encoded_fields = encode_field (\@fields);

    The "encode_field" subroutine method takes a "@fields" and returns a
    "encoded_fields" string. This subroutine will escape all field
    separators.

  encode_record

     \$record = encode_record(\$encoded_fields);

    The "encode_record" subroutine takes a "$encoded_fields" string and
    encodes it as "$record". This subroutines escapes the record separator
    and embeds the record separator in the "$record" string.

  decode_field

     \@fields = decode_field(\$encoded_fields);

    The "decode_fiel" subroutine takes "$encoded_fields", unescape the field
    separators, decodes the fields and places the results in "@fields". The
    "@fields" array is ordered name, value pairs of the fields. The even
    array elements are the field names and the following odd array element
    is the field data.

    The below code will convert the decoded "@fields" to a hash:

      %fields = @fields

  decode_record

     \$encoded_fields  = decode_record(\$record); 

    The "decode_record" subroutine takes a "$record" string, removes the
    record separator, unescapes the record separator in the fields string
    and leaves the fields string in "$encoded_fields".

  get_record

     $record = $form->get_record();

    The get_record method reads a fully encoded "$record" from the
    underlying file of the object.

  new

     $form = Tie::Form->new(@options);
     $form = Tie::Form->new(\@options);
     $form = Tie::Form->new(\%options);

    The "new" method provides an object that may be used to access the
    functions that are in addition to the those established in Tie Handle
    Perl specification. The "@options" are the same as "TIEHANDLE".

REQUIREMENTS
    The general "STD::TestGen" Perl module requirements are as follows:

    general [1] - load
        shall[1] load without error and

    general [2] - pod check
        shall[2] passed the Pod::Checker check without error.

  File format requirements

    For most databases, the file format is hidden. In this case, since the
    file may be accessed and edited by any text editor, the file format
    requirements must be rigorously established in order that they may be
    properly edited.

    The "Tie::Form" module file format will be as follows:

     $field_name: $field_data ^

          ...

     $field_name: $field_data ^
     ~-~

         ...

     ~-~
     $field_name: $field_data ^

          ...

     $field_name: $field_data ^
     ~-~

    The requirements for the file format are as follows:

    format [1] - separator strings
        The format separator strings shall[1] be as follows:

         End of Field Name (EON):  [^:]:[^:]
         ENd of Field Data (EOD):  [^\^]\^[^\^]
         End of Record(EOR):  ~-~

        The separator strings have the following format:

         (not_the_char) . (char) . (not_the_char)

        The '^' character was and still available in console text editors as
        a cursor. Because it appears very rarely in text, it is a good
        choice for use in a separator string. If it does not appear a lot,
        it will not have to be escaped a lot. The "~-~" separator sequence
        is a natural looking text section separator.

    format [2] - separator escapes
        Separator strings embedded in $field_name and $field_data strings
        shall[2] be escaped by adding one additional middle character.
        Escaped sequences must also be escaped. An escaped separator
        sequence will always have one additional middle character from an
        unescaped separator sequence.

    format [3] - field names
        The characters [\x00-\x1f] shall[3] not be allowed in $field_name
        strings. Spaces will be allowed. The character set [\x00-\x1f] are
        the ASCII control characters. See ascii.computerdiamonds.com.
        Embedded [\x00-\x1f] characters will be converted to the '_'
        character.

    format [4] - field names
        Leading and trailing [ \x00-\x1f] characters in any potential
        $field_name string shall[4] not be part of the $field_name and
        discarded.

    format [5] - EON
        A leading [^:] in the EON separator that is not a [ \x00-\x1f]
        shall[5] be the be the last character in the $field_name string;
        otherwise, it is not part of the the $field_name string and
        discarded. For the situation where the last part of a $field_name
        string is an escape sequence a [ \x00-\x1f] will be required between
        the $field_name string and the EON. The following is a valid
        $field_name EON sequence:

          escaped              unescaped

          field_name:: :       fieldname:

    format [6] - Strict EOD
        For the strict format option, the leading [^\^] of the EOD shall[6]
        not be part of the $field_data. The [^\^] character may be any
        character including the [\x00-\x1f] characters.

        Examples of strict format option are as follows:

         $field_name: $data ^
         $field_name: $data$c^

         $field_name: 
         line1
           ..
         line2
         ^

        The $field_data for the above example is as follows:

         Example               $field_data   

         "$data ^"             "$data"  
         "$data$c^"            "$data"
         "$line1\n$line2\n^"   "$line1\n$line2"

    format [7] - Lenient EOD
        For the lenient format option, the leading [^\^] of the EOD shall[7]
        be part of the $field_data. The lenient format has ambiguous case
        when the last character in the $field_data is the [\^] character. In
        order to be valid, a [^\^] must be used before the [\^], making the
        [^\^] part of the $field_data whether that is intended or not. For
        example in, "$data^^ ^", the $field_data is "$data^ " whether or not
        the space is intended as part of the $field_data. If this cannot be
        tolerated for an application the strict format opion should be
        specified.

        Examples of lenient format option are as follows:

         $field_name: $data1 ^

         $field_name: $data2^

         $field_name: 
         $line1
         $line2
         ^

        The $field_data for the above example is as follows:

         Example               $field_data   

         "$data1 ^"            "$data1 "  
         "$data2^"             "$data2"
         "$line1\n$line2\n^"   "$line1\n$line2\n"

  Methods requirements

    There are two options, that impact the methodsas follows:

    strict => 1 option
        This option determines whether to encode a field in strict or
        lenient format.

    binary => 1 option
        This option determines whether or not to process carriage returns
        and line feeds. Different operating systems handle these characters
        differently for text files.

    The requirements for the methods are as follows:

    methods [1] - encode_field
         $field = $tdb->encode_field (\@fields, \$fields)

        The @fields array will contain a number of fields. The $field_names
        will be the even elements and the $field_data the following odd
        elements.

        The encode_field subroutine shall[1] encode the $field_name string
        and $field_data string into the $field string in accordance with the
        File Format requirements. The encoding shall escape the EON and EOD
        separators and embed the EON and EOD separators.

        The encoding will be conservative in complying with the File Format
        requirements.

        As established by the File Format requirements, the encoding will be
        different depending upon the value of the strict option,
        $tdb->{options}->{strict}.

    methods [2] - decode_field
         $success = $tdb->decode_field(\$fields, \@fields)

        The decode_field subroutine shall[2] decode a $record string into
        the @fields array in accordance with the File Format requirements.
        The $field_names will be the even elements in the @fields array and
        the $field_data the following odd elements.

        The decoding will be liberal what it considers that complies to the
        File Format requirements.

        As established by the File Format requirements, the decoding will be
        different depending upon the value of the strict option,
        $tdb->{options}->{strict}.

    methods [3] - encode_record
         $success = $tdb->encode_record(\$fields, \$record) 
         $success = $tdb->encode_record( \$fields) 

        The encode_record subroutine shall[3] encode the $fields string into
        the $record string in accordance with File Format requirements. If
        the $record string is absence or the \$record reference and the
        \$fields reference are the same, the encoding will modify the
        \$fields string. In this case, the encoding will not perserve the
        $fields string. The encoding will escape the EOR and embed the EOR.

    methods [4] - decode_record
         $success  = $tdb->decode_record(\$record, \$fields) 
         $success  = $tdb->decode_record(\$record) 

        The decode_record subroutine shall[4] decode the $record string and
        into the $fields string in accordance with the File Format
        requirements. If the $fields string is absence or the \$record
        reference and the \$fields reference are the same, the encoding will
        modify the \$record string. In this case, the encoding will not
        perserve the $record string. The decoding will remove the EOR and
        unescape the EOR.

    methods [5] - put_record
         $success = $tdb_out->put_record( \$record )

        The put_record subroutine shall[5] write out the $record to the file
        specified when the object $tdb_out was created with the following
        statement

         $tdb_out = Tie::Form( flag => '>', file => $file, @options );

    methods [6] - get_record
         $success = $tdb_in->get_record( \$record )

        The get_record subroutine shall[6] read a $record from the file
        specified when the object $tdb_in was created with the following
        statement

         $tdb_in = Tie::Form( flag => '<', file=>$file, @options );

    methods [7] - get_record
        Unless $tdb_in was created with the binary option, {binary => 1},
        the get_record subroutine shall[7] translate any "\015\012"
        combination into the "\n" for the current operating system.

    Tie::Layers
        The methods inherit from Tie::Layers will comply to the Tie::Layers
        requirements

1.0 SCOPE
    This paragraph identifies and provides an overview of the released
    files.

  1.1 Identification

    This release, identified in 3.2, is a collection of Perl modules that
    extend the capabilities of the Perl language.

  1.2 System overview

    The system is the Perl programming language software. As established by
    the Perl referenced documents, program modules, such the "Tie::Form"
    module, extends the Perl language.

    The "Tie::Form" program module accesses a text database file in the very
    specific Form format and inherits generic database methods from the
    "DataPort::DataFile" module. The "Tie::Form" program module is a data
    source for the "DataPort::DataFile" module.

    The Form format has improve flexability and performance over other text
    base formats such as the Comma Separated Variable (CSV) format.

    The text format resembles as much as possible the standard hard copy
    forms. An example of a "DatatPort::FIleType::Form record follows:

     manhood length: ________ ^
     time spent in big house: _________ ^

     what drugs do you use:
     _________ 
     _________ 

     ^

     ~-~

    The ':' separates field names and field content. The '^' tags the end of
    a field and the '~-~' tags the end of the record. The separation
    sequences are escaped within the form by adding an extra character as
    follows:

      sequence  escaped
      --------  --------
      ~-~       ~--~
      ~--~      ~---~
      ^         ^^
      ^^        ^^^
      :         :
      ::        :::

    Since ~-~ never appears inside a record, Perl or any other Programming
    Language can very easily find the record separators just by ... well ...
    searching for it. The search for the end of field and end of field name
    are just a little bit more complicated. Search for a ':' or '^' all by
    itself. Escaping and unescaping is just adding one more ':', '^', '-' or
    removing one of these characters.

    The Form record looks very much like a hard copy form yet is very simple
    and straight forward for Perl or any other programming language to
    process.
