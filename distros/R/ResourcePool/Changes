Changelog for ResourcePool

V1.0107 - 2013-04-16
  *   Made it Hash-Randomization proof. (Bug #84265)

V1.0105 - 2009-11-25

  *   Made the timeout in the tests less restritive to avoid false 
      failure in case the test is performad on a loaded machine (Bug #29200).

V1.0104 - 2003-05-07

  *  ResourcePool did use a stringified object as key in a hash 
     reference. This has been replaced by using Tie::RefHash. 

V1.0103 - 2003-05-07

  *  Applied a patch from Chad Redman which is basically the same as 
     the patch from Eric Parusel which was partitially applied to 
     1.0102. This time I applied the patch to the correct CVS branch 
     *argl*. 

  *  Minor corrections and improvements in documentation. 

V1.0102 - 2003-03-27

  *  Two new LoadBalancer policies have been introduced: FailBack is 
     a alias for FallBack, and FailOver which acts like FailBack but 
     does stay on the fall back node. 

  *  Applied patch from Eric Parusel to fix a problem when debuging 
     LoadBalancer. 

V1.0101 - 2003-03-14

  *  An obsolete dependency for the Storable module has been removed. 

V1.0100 - 2003-02-27

  *  This release introduces a new way to use ResourcePool and 
     LoadBalancer. It implements the Command design pattern as 
     described in the GOF Design Patterns book. This release is a 
     preview, the features are not yet fully implemented and might 
     therefore not sufficient for you needs right now. 

V1.0000 - 2003-01-02

  *  From this release on, the ResourcePool package will not contain 
     resource bindings anymore. The previously included bindings for 
     DBI and Net::LDAP are available in the ResourcePool-Resource-DBI 
     and ResourcePool-Resource-Net-LDAP packages on CPAN. 

  *  Applied patch from James G Smith which introduced the is_created 
     method to ResourcePool::Singleton. This does not change the 
     behavior of any ResourcePool module. 

V0.9910 - 2002-11-25

  *  The runtime overhead introduced by ResourcePool and LoadBalancer 
     has been reduced. Depending on you configuration this release 
     has up to 35% less overhead. 

  *  Fixed a bug in LoadBalancer's documentation. The Weight 
     parameter works only for the LeastUsage policy. 

  *  A general code cleanup has been done to gain the performance 
     benefits. 

  *  Added tests for LoadBalancer. 

V0.9909 - 2002-10-07

  *  A refactoring of the Singleton behavior of ResourcePool::Factory 
     makes it possible to implement nicer factories 

  *  Adopted ResourcePool::Factory::Net::LDAP to have a more native 
     interface. 

  *  Fixed links within the POD documentation (was broken for some 
     pod2html translators) 

  *  Added documentation for Net::LDAP bindings which were lost in 
     the previous release. 

V0.9908 - 2002-09-30

  *  Added documentation: ResourcePool::BigPicture, ResourcePool::UML 
     and ResourcePool::ExtensionGuide 

  *  Changed Net::LDAP factory to accept the bind parameters in the 
     same way as Net::LDAP expects them. 

  *  Added tests 

V0.9907 - 2002-08-30

  *  Fixed a major bug in Net::LDAP bindings which was introduced in 
     V0.9906. Every LDAP connection was believed to be broken when 
     handed back via free(). 

V0.9906 - 2002-07-10

  *  wrapped DBI calls into eval{} blocks to make RaiseError aware. 

  *  It's possible to pass the options for ResourcePool and 
     LoadBalancer using a Hash reference. 

  *  added tests 

V0.9905 - 2002-07-05

  *  A rollback() is performed on DBI sessions with AutoCommit 
     disabled when they are free()ed. 

  *  free() and fail() for ResourcePool and LoadBalancer return 
     meaningful values. 

  *  added tests 

V0.9904 - 2002-06-04

  *  Implemented the SleepOnFail option for ResourcePool and 
     LoadBalancer. 

  *  Fixed typo in Net::LDAP bindings which caused incomplete error 
     reporting (thx to Sean Welsh) 

  *  Fixed many typo's in the documentation (thx to Florian 
     Helmberger) 

  *  Greatly improved and extended the documentation. 

V0.9903 - 2001-10-15

  *  first public release
