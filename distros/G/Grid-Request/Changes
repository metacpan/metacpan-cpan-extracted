0.5   - Fixed minor perldoc glitch with log4perl-conf documentation.

0.4   - Added configurable block size for MM jobs with the block_size()
        method.
      - Added unit test for the block size method
      - Added new Grid::Request::Test to remove hard coded project value
        for test execution.

0.3   - Fixed a problem with the grid_request_worker in which it could iterate
        past the smallest iterable argument if larger iterable arguments were
        passed in. Now a check is done to determine the smallest and truncate
        the remaining arguments if they are larger...

        Grid::Request::HTC to get the value.
