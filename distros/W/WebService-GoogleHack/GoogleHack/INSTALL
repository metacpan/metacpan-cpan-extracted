   Brill Tagger Installation Instructions (Required only For Sentiment Classification)
   ===================================================================================

   Download the Brill Tagger Installation file from 

   http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~brill/RBT1_14.tar.Z 
   
   and store the installation file in your local directory:

   Eg, /home/username/

   *Note: The following commands are for the Unix/Linux Command prompt.

   Next, unzip and untar the file into your local directory.
   
   COMMAND: uncompress RBT1_14.tar.Z
   COMMAND: tar -xvf RBT1_14.tar.Z

   This command would have unpacked the tagger into

   /home/username/RULE_BASED_TAGGER_V1.14/
   
   (If you had unpacked the Brill Tagger from you local directory) 
  
   Next, Change the directory to the Brill Tagger directory. 

   COMMAND: cd /home/username/RULE_BASED_TAGGER_V1.14/

   The Brill Tagger uses the "cc" compiler. Current Unix and Linux 
   versions use the "gcc" compiler. Hence, change every occurence of "cc" to 
   "gcc" in the file named Makefile.

   Finally, make the installation,
   
   COMMAND: make  

   You should now be able to access the tagger.  So if you had installed the 
   Brill tagger in

   /home/username/

   then, you should be able to see the tagger in

   /home/username/RULE_BASED_TAGGER_V1.14/

   To run the tagger, you would have to go into the Bin_and_Data directory and 
   issue the following command:
  
   COMMAND: tagger LEXICON inputfile BIGRAMS LEXICALRULEFILE CONTEXTUALRULEFILE

   Use the name of the file to be tagged instead of inputfile in the above 
   command. The input file is basically a corpus of text.


INSTALLATION
-------------

If you would like more information on installing Perl modules, visit:

   http://www.perl.com/pub/a/2002/04/10/mod_perl.html


Please make sure to install the entire package.

There are multiple ways to install the module. 


1) You can use CPAN.pm to install WebSerivce::GoogleHack. To install the module type the following commands in the Unix command prompt:

   COMMAND: perl -MCPAN -e 'install WebSerice::GoogleHack'

The advantage of Using CPAN to install the module is that it will also install 
all the other modules required by WebSerivce::GoogleHack.

2) Otherwise, to install the module manually:

   2.1) Unzip and untar the GoogleHack installation files.

   COMMAND: gunzip WebService-GoogleHack-0.1.tar.gz

   COMMAND: tar -xvf WebService-GoogleHack-0.1

   2.2) Next, CD into the untarred GoogleHack directory.

   COMMAND: cd WebService/GoogleHack/

   2.3) Next, make the installation:

   For the command given below, please make sure to replace LOCALPERLLIBPATH 
   and  LOCALBINPATH with the path to your local perl lib directory and 
   your local bin directory respectively. We do not need to create these 
   directories manually, because the installation command later on will 
   automatically take care of that. An example command is also given.

   COMMAND: perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=LOCALPERLLIBPATH LIB=LOCALBINPATH

   EXAMPLE COMMAND: perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/home/username/lib/ LIB=/home/username/bin

   2.4) Next, type in the following command:

   COMMAND: make
   
   2.5) Next, We need to test if the package is working correctly:
   
   *Note: This command will also prompt the user for the Google API key, and 
    the path to the Google wsdl file.
    
   COMMAND: make test

   2.6) If the tests were succesful, install the program:

   COMMAND: make install

   If the tests were not successful, you must be missing some of the 
   pre-requisites or you must have typed in the wrong API key or path to 
   WSDL file.


3) Next, we need to add this LOCALBINPATH to the perl @INC variable. To do 
   this, open your .cshrc file, this should be in your local directory.

   /home/username/.cshrc

   3.1) Open your .cshrc file and add this line to it:

   3.1)setenv PERL5LIB LOCALBINPATH

   Where you would replace LOCALBINPATH with the your local directory name.

   EG: setenv PERL5LIB /home/username/bin 

   Save the changes, Next issue the command:
   
   COMMAND: source .cshrc

   *Note:If you get an error saying command "setenv" not found, replace the 
   word sentenv with the word "export" and try sourcing the .cshrc file again.

   This should have added the LOCALBINPATH to your Perl @INC variable.To see if
   the command was successful, issue the following command:

   COMMAND:perl -V

   This command will print out all the directories in which Perl would look for
    modules.

4) To install the web interface please follow the instructions given in
