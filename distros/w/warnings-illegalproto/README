NAME
    warnings::illegalproto - Disable illegal prototype warnings on old Perls

VERSION
    version 0.001003

SYNOPSIS
     use strictures 1;
     use signatures;
     no warnings::illegalproto;

     sub ($foo) { ... }

DESCRIPTION
    This module was implemented so that people can "use strictures" and "use
    signatures" at the same time. Thanks to mst, in Perl 5.12 and greater
    this is trivial, but before that a strange dance had to be done.

    This module will do the right thing for both before and after 5.12, but
    if you want to use the native 5.12 and greater without this module, feel
    free to cargo cult the following:

     no if $[ >= 5.012, warnings => 'illegalproto';
     no if $[ < 5.012, 'warnings::illegalproto';
