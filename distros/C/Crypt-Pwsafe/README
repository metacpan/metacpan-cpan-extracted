NAME

    V3 data files

    Version 1.1

    my $file = 'pwsafe.psafe3';
    my $key = Crypt::Pwsafe::enter_combination();
    my $pwsafe = Crypt::Pwsafe->new($file, $key);

DESCRIPTION
    Crypt::Pwsafe module provide read-only access to database files created
    by Version 3 of PasswordSafe utility available from SourceForge at
    <http://passwordsafe.sf.net>.

    Users of this module should take these notes:

    1. All passwords will be stored in memory unencrypted (in the form of
    Perl hashes) once the password file is loaded.

    2. The module will read the entire content of the password file into
    memory. This may be a problem for large data files on systems with small
    amount of memory.

    3. The modules does not support Version 2 Passwordsafe data files.
    Please convert them to Version 3 if needed.
