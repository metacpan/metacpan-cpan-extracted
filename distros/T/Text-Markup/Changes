Revision history for Perl extension Text-Markup.

0.32  2024-02-08T03:25:18Z
    - Added the ability to change the regular expression for a format by
      passing it in the `use` statement.

0.31  2023-09-10T23:24:43Z
    - Fixed the passing of parameters to `parse()`.
    - Documented the parameters passable to `parse()` for each parser.

0.30  2023-09-10T16:42:18Z
    - Removed very old custom paths to `docutils` (reST) and `asciidoc`
      binaries on Windows. Users must ensure that the proper commands are
      in the PATH, instead.
    - Added Text::Markdown::Asciidoctor, which uses the `asciidoctor` command,
      as a updated alternative to Text::Markdown::Asciidoc, which uses the
      legacy `asciidoc` command. Text::Markdown will not use this formatter by
      default, but when explicitly loaded will be used instead of
      Text::Markup::Asciidoc.
    - Added Text::Markup::CommonMark, which uses the cmark library, via the
      CommonMark module. Text::Markdown will not use this formatter by
      default, but when explicitly loaded will be used instead of
      Text::Markup::Markdown.
    - De-duped the utilities for managing external commands from the Rest and
      Asciidoc modules into Text::Markdown::Cmd.

0.25  2023-09-04T22:20:13Z
    - Fixed the importation of Pod::Simple::XHTML, Text::Trac, Text::Textile,
      and Text::MediawikiFormat to use the correct syntax for requiring a
      minimum version. Thanks to Graham Knop for the PR (#27)!
    - Fixed a reStructuredText test failure on newer versions of `docutils`.
    - Moved development test dependencies from recommended prereqs to
      development prereqs.
    - Increased the minimum required Module::Build version to 0.4209.
    - Added GitHub Workflows for testing and releasing and removed Travis
      testing. Test on Perl 5.8 - 5.38 on Linux, macOS, an Windows.
    - Fixed bugs executing Rest and Asciidoc on Windows.
    - Updated Asciidoc ot find `asciidoc.bat` and `asciidoc.exe` on Windows.

     - Added missing `<head>` tag to all output. Thanks to Axel Beckert for
       the pull request (#16, #18)!
     - Added the `format_matchers` class method, which returns a list of
       formats and the regular expressions that match them.
     - Added `use warnings;` to all modules, thanks to a patch from John SJ
       Anderson (#22).
     - Added support for a `--raw` option to the markup modules for which it
       makes sense. This option allows markup to be output without wrapping
       it in a minimal HTML skeleton. Thanks to John SJ Anderson for the
       patch (#2, #24)!
     - Ported reST to Python 3. Thanks to gregor herrmann for the PR (#26).

0.23  2015-05-21T06:23:35Z
     - Added BBcode and Creole to the module description.
     - Fixed a failing test for the Mediawiki format due to a change in CGI
       v4.14. This reverses the workaround required by CGI 4.11, introduced
       in v0.20. Not that you care. It's just a test change.
     - Updated the Pod parser to determine the indentation of verbatim blocks
       by the line with the shortest leading whitespace, rather than the
       whitespace of just the first line. Inspired by an equivalent approach
       in Mojolicious by Joel Berger.

0.22  2015-02-20T03:52:36Z
     - Added support for Creole. Thanks to Lucas Kanashiro for the patch!

0.21  2015-02-17T00:18:20Z
     - Fixed description of Asciidoc and added it to the README.
     - Added support for BBcode. Thanks to Lucas Kanashiro for the patch!

0.20   2015-01-22T00:54:50Z
     - Fixed a failing test for the Mediawiki format due to a change in CGI
       v4.11. Thanks to Andreas Koenig for the report and diagnosis.

0.19  2014-02-07T04:00:56Z
     - Fixed Pod markup so that it does not strip text from the first line of
       verbatim blocks.
     - Removed the `--safe` option from Asciidoc. It is just borked with the
       XHTML back end.

0.18  2013-06-08T23:24:09Z
     - Now require HTML::Tagset, since Text::MediawikiFormat seems to need it
       but only recommends it.
     - Removed all Pod tests from the distribution.
     - Updated reST to support docutils 0.7 - 0.10 and when Pygments is not
       available. Daniele Varrazzo.

0.17  2012-02-28T04:31:07Z
     - Added Asciidoc support.

0.16  2012-02-13T17:23:00Z
     - Rest support now uses its own implementation of `rst2html` so that it
       can render specialized reST documents, such as Sphinx files, in a more
       forgiving way: it preserves the content of unknown directives while
        not emulating specialized rendering. Written by Daniele Varrazzo.
     - Improved handling of Sphinx directives in Rest output. Most directives
       are stripped out, although `function` directives now turn out much
       nicer. Props to Daniele Varrazzo for the work on the Rest parser.
     - Fixed character encoding issues with the Rest parser.
     - Fixed a character encoding issue in the test suite.

0.15  2012-01-13T23:04:16Z
      - Changed the parsers to return `undef` if no content was parsed from a
        file.
      - Added reST support, with thanks to Daniele Varrazzo.

0.14  2011-10-09T17:45:28Z
      - Added option processing to the Pod parser. Thanks to Mark Allen for
        the pull request.

0.13  2011-05-21T15:33:28
      - Fixed broken regular expression in the Pod parser that could eat the
        first line of a verbatim block.

0.12  2011-04-04T23:16:12
      - Documented that the `file` parameter to `parse()` is required.
      - Added MultiMarkdown support.
      - Fixed test failure in `t/formats.t` when no supported markup parser
        is installed.

0.11  2011-02-22T22:41:15
      - Added list of supported markups to the README.
      - Fixed test failures on Perls earlier than 5.12.

        + HTML
