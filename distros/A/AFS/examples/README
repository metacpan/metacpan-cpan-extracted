          This is the README file for the AFS Perl examples.
                      AFS Perl (Version 2.6.4)


WHERE ARE THE EXAMPLES?
    A collection of examples demonstrating various functions and
    methods are stored in the directory "v2".  All scripts in "v2"
    conform with the interface version 2.  For more details read the
    appropriate POD documentations.



HOW TO USE THE EXAMPLES
    All scripts in "v2" are designed that you can run them without
    prior installation of the AFS module bundle.  After you have
    performed the steps "perl Makefile.pl", "make", and eventually
    "make test" you can run these test scripts.  Just step into the
    different subdirectories and run the available examples, e.g:
    
        cd AFS-2.6.4/examples/v2/base
        ./error_test
