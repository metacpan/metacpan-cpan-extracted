0.04 2011-12-03 Bug fix release, update recommended

- Update recommended for users of 32-bit perl

- Bug fix release re-addressing previous attempts at fixing bug
  (see 0.03). The issue seemed to be one of architecture and
  where I have only developed on 64-bit enabled platforms using
  64-bit enabled perl I could not replicate the issue, which was
  related to Perl's sprintf on 32-bit perl. I now use string
  indications (s) instead of signed integer (d) and it seems to
  work.
