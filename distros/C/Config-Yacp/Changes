	- Added the following functions

	- Re-implemented all of the tests using the Test::More
	  module

1.17  Fri Nov 21 08:12:54 2003
	- Changed the grammar slightly, so that if a particular
	  key/value pair does not have the value defined, it will
	  still correctly parse the ini file
	    - This idea was inspired by the following node on
	      PerlMonks: http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=308716
	- Added additional tests to test other functions of the module.

1.18  Mon Jan 10 14:09:35 2005

        - Now uses the Object::InsideOut module
	- Added some additional tests
	- Changed the names of the module functions to keep them
