1.51  2016-04-02 
  
  [Bug fixes]
  - fix a syntax error with all perl versions < 5.22
  - fix calls to _generic_show()

1.50  2016-04-02

  [Bug fixes]
  - avoid problems with Log4perl calls in Perl global destruction phase;
    symptoms are error messages like this:
    
      (in cleanup) Internal error: Root Logger not initialized. at /opt/perl5/perls/perl-5.20.2/lib/site_perl/5.20.2/VCS/CMSynergy/Client.pm line 277.

      VCS::CMSynergy::DESTROY(VCS::CMSynergy=HASH(0x499b148)) called at ./smint.pl line 0

  [BEWARE - USER VISIBLE CHANGE]
  - cat_object(): drop array ref and code ref as possible destinations

  [Other changes]
  - implement Object methods recursive_is_FOO_of() and recursive_has_FOO()
    (the corresponding query functions appeared in Synergy 7.2)

  - _ccm(): make it possible to read "ccm" stdout/stderr as UTF-8
    
  - use ccm() instead of _ccm() for AUTOLOADed methods so that we have 
    the same behavior wrt exceptions: if you check the return values(s), 
    no exception will be thrown

  - add a new sub class of VCS::CMSynergy::Object for transfer sets

  - modify *_object() methods to use corresponding query functions
    - supported Synergy versions now start at 7.x
    - add optional @keywords parameter
    - add tset_object(): tset object from transferset name

  - remove full_history* methods: they were never documented and are
    unnecessary as of Synergy >= 7.2 (where "ccm history" already returns
    the "full" history

  - update Module::Install to 1.16

  - add a note that show_reconfigure_properties() is obsolete
    in Synergy 7.2 and up

  - cat_object(): add TRACE message describing the destination

  - fix some warnings from perlcritic

1.49  2015-04-14

  [Bug fixes]
  - fix project_tree() when using omit_top_dir
  - fix problem with get_attribute() of a non-existent attribute in web mode
    (would throw an exception, but should just return undef)

  [Other changes]
  - add LICENSE file, convert README to markdown format
  - upload to GitHub (https://github.com/rschupp/VCS-CMSynergy)
    and add this repository to resources
  - downgrade a Log::Log4perl message from INFO to DEBUG

1.48  2015-04-02

  [BEWARE - USER VISIBLE CHANGE]
  - add optional @keywords parameter to VCS::CMSynergy::ls_object()
    - makes syntax consistent with ls_{arrayref,hashref} and other
      *_object methods
    - make parameter $file_spec mandatory (otherwise parameters are ambiguous)

  [Other changes]
  - drop all references to obsolete get_member_info CLI command
  - make VCS::CMsynergy->new(CCM_ADDR => ..., role => ..., ...) work
  - make tests t/*t not fail when CCM_TEST_DB is not set

1.47  2015-03-22

  [New methods for baseline, process_rule, projects and project_grouping objects]
  - add derived classes VCS::CMSynergy::{Baseline,ProcessRule,ProjectGrouping}
  - add methods show_hashref(), show_object() that wrap 
    "ccm baseline -show WHAT" etc
  - add convenience methods project_grouping(), process_rules()
    to VCS::CMSynergy::Project to quickly move from a project to its
    project_grouping or process_rules, resp.

  [Bug fixes]
  - add workaround for with some Types:Standard expression 
    in certain Perl versions

      perl -MTypes::Standard=Str,ArrayRef,slurpy \
        -e 'my @spec = ( [], Str | ArrayRef[Str], slurpy ArrayRef[Str] ); 
            print scalar(@spec), "\n";'
    
    prints:
    
        2 (broken): Perl 5.8.9 5.10.1 5.12.4
        3 (OK): Perl 5.14.4 5.16.3 5.20.1
    
    Adding superfluous parenthesis around complex Types::Standard expressions
    like "Str | ArrayRef[Str]" makes all Perl versions print "3".

1.46  2015-03-01

  [BEWARE - USER VISIBLE CHANGE]
  - rename VCS::CMSynergy::Project::object_from_proj_ref() to object_from_path()

  [Bug fixes]
  - work around a problem with Type::Params::validate() 
    in certain Perl versions

  [Other changes]
  - make history commands in web mode more robust

1.45  2015-02-21

  [Bug fixes]
  - fix a critical thinko with error handling in ccm():
    ccm() erroneously reports an error when
    - RaiseError or PrintError is on
    - it is called in void context
    - the actual "ccm" command exited with success
    thanks to Jürgen Schorer for reporting this
  - don't "remember" CCM_ADDR in $self until we've checked it
  - if CCM_ADDR is bogus, don't croak(), use set_error() instead
  
  [Other changes]
  - add documentaion about logging via Log::Log4perl;
    remove reference to no longer existing trace() and trace_msg() methods
  - add explicitly "provides" and drop "no_index: namespace";
    hopefully this will make the documentation for
    VCS::CMSynergy::{Client,Object,Project,Helper} show up on CPAN

1.42  2015-02-01

  [BEWARE - USER VISIBLE CHANGE]
  - change error handling for ccm(): if the user checks the return value
    of ccm() (ie. calls ccm() in non-void context) do NOT RaiseError etc
  - users NOT using PrintError/RaiseError/HandleError should see no
    change in behaviour
  - users using PrintError/RaiseError/HandleError are now given a choice:
    they can use try/catch semantics as before OR they can check
    return codes

  [Other changes]
  - make starting a session in classic mode work again
  - when re-using an existing session, fail early if CCM_ADDR is bogus
  - actually allow undef in some arguments as per documentation
    
1.41  2015-01-26

  [BEWARE - USER VISIBLE CHANGE]
  - incompatible change: relations_arrayref() now returns objectnames
    in the "from" and "to" slots of a result row; previously it returned
    VCS::CMSynergy::Objects in these slots
  - this makes it more consistent compared with relations_hashref().

  [New methods for retrieving properties of several objects in one command]
  - add properties_hashref(), properties_object() methods
  - for getting multiple properties for a lsit of objects with
    a single CLI command
  - interface similar to query_{hashref,object}()

  [Other changes]
  - remove outdated "classic mode only" annotations for some methods from POD

1.40  2014-12 25  Just when I thought I was out... they pull me back in.

  [BEWARE - USER VISIBLE CHANGE]
    - The internal structure if VCS::CMSynergy::Object has changed.
    - This above breaks programs using $obj->{name} etc, but they shouldn't
      rely on implementation details.
    - $obj->objectname (or just the stringization of $obj) now uses
      the "all colon" form. This should not matter when passing it back
      to Synergy (for any still supported Synergy version), but could
      cause problems for a program that parses these strings themself
      (which it shouldn't do, use VCS::CMSynergy::Object methods instead).

  [Use "Log::Log4perl enable" for logging]
    - add a dependency on Log::Log4perl
    - remove trace(), trace_msg() methods and $Debug, $Debugfh package variables
    - instead use Log::Log4perl :easy functions INFO(), TRACE() etc where appropriate
    - emulate the old environment variable CMSYNERGY_TRACE by easy_initializing
      Log::Log4perl in a compatible manner
      Note: CMSYNERGY_TRACE is only honored  if Log::Log4perl isn't initialized
      already, so as not to interfere with an explicit initialization
      outside of VCS::CMSynergy

  [New shortcut query syntax]
    - new syntax is 
      $ccm->query_method([ key => value , ...], @keywords)
    - key => value translates to "key = 'value'"
    - omit quotes if value is "TRUE or "FALSE"
    - use "match" instead of "=" if value contains wildcards
    - key => \@values translates to ANY_OF(key, @values)
    - combine same keys with "or"
    - combine all others with "and"
    - deprecate old style syntax
      $ccm->query_method({ key => value , ...}, @keywords)

  [VCS::CMSynergy::Users: make methods case insensitive wrt user names]
    - newer Synergy version treat user name case insensitively:
    - return a Tie::CPHash from users()
    - add a dependeny on Tie::CPHash
    - get rid of insertion order preserving hashes, the order of lines
      in "ccm users" was never relevant
    - make delete_roles() delete the user if it has no more roles left
      (because users without roles aren't allowed by Synergy anyway).

  [New methods full_history_hashref() and full_history_arrayref()]
    When an object is renamed (probably also when its cvtype changed),
    "ccm history" (and hence history_hashref()) doesn't show the full history.
    Add new methods that will do that.

  [Other changes]
  - update for Synergy 7.2, make most methods work with web mode 

  - drop support for Synergy versions older than 6.5

  - normalize objectnames to "all colon separator" form

  - VCS::CMSynergy::Project: add method has_child()

  - upgrade to Module::Install 1.14

  - add covenience functions ANY_OF() and NONE_OF(),
    useful when building complex queries
    
  - always return "unique" objects, not only for :cached_attributes.
    
  - for :tied_objects make it possible to use
    $obj->{objectname}, $obj->{name} etc (read-only, of course)
    
  - kwalitee fixes

  - reformat Changes file according to CPAN::Changes::Spec

  - Cygwin: get rid of obsolescent Filesys::CygwinPaths
    - replace calls to fullwin32path() by running the cygpaths utility

  - replace homegrown _usage() with Type::Params and
    add a dependency on Type::Params and Types::Standard 

  - move all tests in t/ requiring the "tutorial" database to xt/
    and don't distribute them anymore

  - VCS::CMSynergy::Project: add convenience methods project_tree(), top_dir()

  - make VCS::CMSynergy::Object methods "displayname" and "cvid" cache
    their result in the attribute cache (even if not using :cached_attributes)
    and look there first; this makes the following work wrt caching
  
      use VCS::CMSynergy ':cached_attributes';
      ...
      my $result = $ccm->query_object("...", qw( displayname ));
      foreach (@$result) {
          ... $_->displayname ...; # look Ma: already cached
      }
  
  - purge all references to the deprecated "query_object_with_attributes"

1.35  2010-05-22

  - Telelogic has been bought by IBM and "CM Synergy" is now called 
    "IBM Rational Synergy":

    - VCS::CMSynergy::Client: correctly parse output of "ccm version"
    - use the same regex in Makefile.PL
    - drop some text references to "Telelogic"
    - small fixes to test suite for Synergy 7.1


  - First crack at supporting Synergy 7.x "web mode"

    - VCS::CMSynergy::_start, VCS::CMSynergy::new
      - accept option "server => URL" ("ccm start -s URL ..")
      - document "server" option
      - don't supply empty ini file when this option is used 
        (fixes "ccm start": "-f" is illegal when "-s" is specified)

    - t/util.pm: accept URL (instead of hostname) in CCM_TEST_USER string,
      put it in $test_session{server}

    - t/01session.t: when using web mode there's a lag between "ccm stop" exiting
      and the session disappearing from "ccm ps"; delay after 
      closing a session before checking "ccm ps"

    - adapt parsing of "ccm attribute -ls ...": web mode omits the
      parentheses around type and origin

    - ye olde editor trick: web mode renames placeholder %filename to %file

  - Changes to project traversal and diff methods

    - VCS::CMSynergy::Project::traverse
      - add an option "pathsep" that will be "passed down" 
        to VCS::CMSynergy::Traversal::path() 
      - remove the (undocumented) optional $pathsep parameter from
        VCS::CMSynergy::Traversal::path()
      - speed up VCS::CMSynergy::Traversal::path() a bit by precomputing
        the dirname part (as $_catdirs) and only recomputing this
        when @_dirs actually changes
      - fix inadvertent modification of passed-in "wanted" hash
      - make robust against this by copying the hash as early as possible

    - VCS::CMSynergy::project_tree
      add option "omit_top_dir" 

    - VCS::CMSynergy::project_diff
      - new method
      - driver for a "differ" class walking the tree returned 
        by VCS::CMSynergy::project_tree()
      - re-implement examples/ccm_project_diff using project_diff()

  - Spring cleaning - remove deprecated stuff

    - get_releases, set_releases: manipulation of stone-age "release table"
    - _cat_binary, _attype_is_binary: workaround for "ccm cat" on binary objects
      is not necessary anymore
    - delete corresponding note in pod for VCS::CMSynergy::cat_object

  - Don't use global filehandles.

  - Document VCS::CMSynergy::user().

  - Fix wrong documentation for some VCS::CMSynergy::Object methods
    (spotted by Helge Sauer).

1.34  2008-10-18

  - Implement VCS::CMSynergy::Object method mydata(): associate arbitrary data 
    with object.

  - Implement (previously forgotten) VCS::CMSynergy::Object method cat_object().

  - Fix bug: @VCS::CMSynergy::Traversal::dirs and
    @VCS::CMSynergy::Traversal::projects are empty during
    VCS::CMsynergy::Project::traverse() (reported by Andy Hassall).

  - Fix a long standing problem: the record for process "router"
    may be missing from the list returned by ps().

  - Accept objectnames with ":" as the first delimiter
    (instead of the database delimiter), as seen in recent Synergy versions
    (e.g. "releasedef" objects) - Synergy accepts them, too.

  - Move ccm_project_diff from examples/ to script/.

  - Documentation updates:
    - clarify behaviour of finduse() when an argument refers to a 
      non-existing object
    - when describing boolean options, use true/false instead of "on"/"off"

1.33  2008-03-12

  - Follow the advice in "How can I stop getting FAIL reports
    for missing libraries or other non-Perl dependencies" from
    http://cpantest.grango.org/wiki/CPANAuthorNotes: if no working Synergy
    installation is found, make Makefile.PL exit(0), but without generating
    Makefile.

1.32  2008-02-01

  - The CPAN indexer exposed a problem with extracting module VERSIONs
    from SVN $Revision$ tags (which only shows with Perl 5.10). 
    Otherwise no changes.

1.31  2008-02-01

  - Implemented show_reconfigure_properties() Project method.

  - On Cygwin, make sure that path names that are passed down to Synergy
    are in native Windows form.

  - Added -ui_database_dir to session in test suite (bug 27260).
    This should make the tests run with an out-of-the-box Synergy
    client installation.

  - Tested with Synergy 6.5 SP1 and Perl 5.10.

1.30  2007-05-22

  - Ported to CM/Synergy 6.5: the product is now called "Telelogic Synergy".
    Also some changes to the test suite, but it still requires 
    the "tutorial" database from CCM 6.4 before SP1 (upgraded, of course,
    to your Synergy version).

  - examples/project_diff in --terse mode will now mark ("~") items
    that have different cvtypes (e.g. directory vs regular file)
    or instances in both projects.

  - Small cleanups. It is now checked that certain special keywords,
    e.g. "task_objects", can only be used in query-type methods
    when the result data structure is a hash or an array ref (i.e.
    _not_ a VCS::CMSynergy::Object).

1.29  2007-01-17

  - Implemented get_member_info_hashref() and get_member_info_object() 
    as wrappers for the optional command "get_member_info" (from
    the "PC Integrations" package), cf. README.get_member_info.

  - New class VCS::CMSynergy::Project (subclass of VCS::CMSynergy::Object)
    for methods on Synergy projects. All VCS::CMSynergy::Object producing
    methods will automatically return a VCS::CMSynergy::Project if the
    the object's cvtype is "project".

  - query_object() subsumes query_object_with_attributes() which 
    is only kept as an alias for backward compatibility.

  - object_from_cvid() now takes an optional list of keywords (to prime
    the object's attributes when using :cached_attributes.).

  - Implemented object_from_proj_ref().

  - More special keywords recognized in query_* (and related) methods:
    "cr_objects", "baseline_project", "baseline_object". These are similar
    to "task_objects" (which splits the list of tasks returned from 
    Synergy's pseudo attribute %task and objectifies the elements)
    for the pseudo attributes %change_request, %baseline, %in_baseline.

1.28  2006-04-09

  - INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: set_attribute() doesn't fail anymore when
    you try to change the value of an inherited attribute. Instead, it
    silently converts the inherited attribute to a local attribute
    (using "ccm attribute -create -force ...").
    This also works when using :tied_objects and assigning to
    $obj->{attribute_name}.

  - Implemented relations_hashref(), relations_object(), wrappers
    for "ccm relate -show" similar to the query_*() family.

  - Implemented V::C::Object methods recursive_is_member_of(), 
    hierarchy_project_members().

  - Add option "mark_projects" to project_tree(): list projects instead
    of their top level directories.

  - Add special handling of CM Synergy release objects 
    (i.e. of cvtype "relasedef") to the query_*() functions because they
    also have a non-standard objectname method.

  - Don't cache the results of "ccm attr -la" in VCS::CMsynergy::Object anymore 
    because it bloated V::C::Os for little gain.

  - Convert VCS::CMSynergy::Object to use to Class::Accessor::Fast.

  - Convert tests to use Test::Deep.

  - Use Module::Install to bundle Test::* modules i(and others)
    required for `make test' only. Change Makefile.PL accordingsly, add
    MANIFEST.SKIP and generate MANIFEST and META.yml.

  - Rewrote examples/project_diff.

  - Finally got rid of the (undocumented) $OneArgFoo misfeature (and
    corresponding first parameter of _ccm()).

1.27  2005-11-08

  - Fixed a bug where empty string attributes could be returned 
    as undef in query_*() (depending on the order of %keywords 
    in the actual query). Reason was the careless use of split()
    without a limit (which strips trailing empty fields by default).

  - INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: Make attribute values returned from 
    the query_*() family consistent with the return value of get_attribute()
    w.r.t. a trailing newline: If the "real" attribute value is "foo\nbar\n"
    then that's what query_hashref() would have returned. But get_attribute()
    would have returned "foo\nbar" (i.e. stripped the trailing newline).
    The reason is that get_attribute() uses "ccm attr -show" and
    Synergy always appends a newline to the output of a command unless
    one is already there. So there's no way of telling whether the "real"
    value was "foo\nbar" or "foo\nbar\n". Therefore ccm() has always stripped
    a trailing newline from the command's stdout. Now we return "foo\nbar"
    in both cases.

  - Users.pm: Always try to preserve the order of a user's roles.
    If an insertion preserving order tied hash class (e.g. Tie::IxHash)
    is available, also preserve the order of user lines.

  - Implemented folder_object() (similar to task_object()).

  - Make cat_object() work when destination is a filehandle or glob ref
    (now that my fix has found its way into IPC::Run3).

  - Implement V::C::Object methods is_RELATION_of and has_RELATION
    (via AUTOLOAD): $obj->is_RELATION_of is short for

  -   $obj->ccm->query_object("is_RELATION_of('$obj')")

  - Add README.datetime about problems with CM Synergy when trying
    to obtain predictable and consistent datetime values.

  - Add tests for POD and POD coverage and all test failures.

  - Drop README.IPC-Run3 as behaviour with fork is fixed with IPC::Run3 0.032.

1.26  2005-07-05

  - INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: get_attribute() doesn't fail any more if the
    attribute doesn't exist for the given object, it returns "undef"
    instead.  This is more consistent with the behaviour of "ccm query
    -f %foo ..."  when some returned object doesn't have attribute "foo":
    "ccm query -f %foo ..."  puts "<void>" into the corresponding column
    which all query_*() methods will translate to "undef". It also fits
    better with the object-as-hash-of-its-attributes metapher when using
    :tied_objects.

  - INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: The initial attribute value is now mandatory
    (i.e. must be defined) for create_attribute().

  - Added README.IPC-Run3 about problems when scripts using VCS::CMSynergy
    do fork() and call VCS::CMSynergy methods both from parent and child.

  - Make query_count() accept shortcut queries like the rest of query_*.

  - Fix quoting of string values in shortcut queries: use double quotes
    if the string contains single quotes. Fix the regex used to
    sanitize the query string.

  - The method to set an attribute to an empty string value used by 
    set_attribute() doesn't work on Windows (and I don't know any that works),
    so error out in this case.

  - Fixed a bug where multi-line valued properties would be returned
    as undef by property().

  - Dont stop session in VCS::CMSynergy::DESTROY if the current process
    is not the one that created the VCS::CMSynergy object (i.e. after a fork,
    stop session only in the parent, never in the child).

1.24  2005-01-07

  - Fix for bug reported by Robert Kirchner:
    If a session (i.e. VCS::CMSynergy object) is implicitly DESTROYed
    at program termination the script always exits with status 0,
    regardless of any explicit status set with exit(). 
    This was caused by an unlocalized $? in VCS::CMSynergy::Client::exec().

  - Implemented query_count().

  - Implemented pseudo keyword "task_objects" (query_* and history_* methods).

  - The query string in query_*() methods may now contain newlines
    to improve legibility. These will be replaced by blanks in _query().

  - Make set_attribute() work for empty string values.

1.22  2004-08-16

  - Fix breakage on Cygwin introduced in 1.20 - UseCoprocess
    still doesn't work though.

  - Restore VCS::CMSynergy::Helper.pm which was accidentally mangled in 1.20.

  - Change documentation and usage of VCS::CMSynergy::Helper::GetOptions()
    to use the returned value as a hash.

1.20  2004-08-10

  - WARNING: This version is known NOT to work on Cygwin 
    (due to CRLF vs LF issues).

  - IPC::Run3 is now a requisite module.

  - Dropped support for CM Synergy 4.5.

  - Implemented dcm_database_id(), dcm_delimiter(), dcm_enabled(), 
    default_project_instance() and VCS::CMSynergy::Object::exists().

  - Implemented "unique" VCS::CMSynergy::Objects when using :cached_attributes.

  - Implemented project_tree(), made examples/project_diff use it.

  - Replaced IPC::Open3 with IPC::Run3 in VCS::CMSynergy::Client::exec().

  - Implemented object_from_cvid(), documentet object_other_version().

  - Implemented VCS::CMSynergy::Object::copy_attribute().

  - Reinstated types() because of popular demand (read the ACcent sources
    if you really want to know what exactly is returned by "ccm show -types").
    Added migrate_auto_rules().

1.18  2004-05-13

  - Removed types() - not useful.
    Removed proj_vers(), use displayname() instead.

  - Added attribute caching (optional feature, "use VCS::CMSynergy ':cached_attributes'").
    Added query_object_with_attributes() and "attributes" option 
    for traverse_project() that prime object caches with results from query.

  - Documented VCS::CMSynergy::Client; reorganized PODs.

  - Added example script project_tree (thanks to Anne Feldmeier
    for the simplified itree building algorithm).

  - Added example script project_diff.

  - Fixed bug (typo) in update_users.pm spotted by Jürgen Schorer.

  - Fixed t/07workarea.t so that it doesn't assume that the temporary
    project work area path is of the form tempdir/name-version, 
    use attribute wa_path instead.

  - Implemented `postprocess' callback for traverse_project().

  - Trace information for CM commands now includes the elpased time to
    execute the command. Layout of trace information changed for debug
    levels >= 8.

1.16  2003-09-26

  - BIG FAT WARNING: VERSION 1.5 INTRODUCED AN INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE 
    wrt VCS::CMSynergy class methods (e.g. ps() or databases()), see below.

  - INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: The hash returned by finduse() and the "finduse" 
    keyword for query_arrayref()/query_hashref() no longer has keys of the
    form "project-version". The keys are now the full objectnames of the
    projects (regardless which form is returned by CM Synergy). This was
    necessary sincd CM Synergy 6.3 allows for projects with instance
    other than '1'.

  - Implemented traverse_project() (modelled on File::Find).

  - Hacked up script examples/grep_attr: greps attribute values
    for a list of objects (optionally determined by a query).

  - Documented the fact that query_arrayref() and query_hashref() will
    rewrite values for keyword "objectname" that CM Synergy returns
    in deprecated fullname form.

  - Tested on CM Synergy 6.3 SP1 (some tests needed adjustments).

  - INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: VCS::CMSynergy class methods are now
    implemented differently and should not expect to use the value 
    of $ENV{CCM_HOME} current at the time the method is called.
    Code that doesn't manipulate $ENV{CCM_HOME} is unaffected,
    but the following idiom (often seen in administrator scripts
    in an environment with several CM Synergy installations) 
    WILL NOT WORK ANYMORE:

      # run "ccm ps" on all our installations
      use VCS::CMSynergy;
      ...
      foreach my $ccm_home (qw(/usr/local/ccm51 /usr/local/ccm62))
      {
          local $ENV{CCM_HOME} = $ccm_home;
          my $ps = VCS::CMSynergy->ps(...);
          ...
      }

    That's because the very first invocation of any VCS::CMSynergy
    (or VCS::CMSynergy::Client) class method "captures" the value
    of $ENV{CCM_HOME} at that time. This value is then used for all
    class method invocations.  Hence in the above example,
    you will run "ccm ps" twice with CCM_HOME=/usr/local/ccm51.

  - The correct way to rewrite the example is to make the setting of
    CCM_HOME explicit by introducing a VCS::CMSynergy::Client object:

      use VCS::CMSynergy;
      use VCS::CMSynergy::Client;
      ...
      foreach my $ccm_home (qw(/usr/local/ccm51 /usr/local/ccm62))
      {
          my $installation = VCS::CMSynergy::Client->new(CCM_HOME => $ccm_home);
          my $ps = $installation->ps(...);
          ...
      }

  - Split out VCS::CMSynergy class methods (e.g. ps()) into their own class,
    VCS::CMSynergy::Client. Basically, a V::C::Client object encapsulates 
    a particular setting of CCM_HOME. Invoking these methods as class
    methods (either on VCS::CMSynergy or VCS::CMSynergy::Client) still works,
    but they are silently redirected to a "default" V::C::Client object.
    This object is instantiated the first time it is needed and gets the
    value of CCM_HOME valid in %ENV at that time. If you want to call
    V::C::Client methods with different values of CCM_HOME in the
    same program, you must explicitly instantiate different V::C::Client objects
    and call the methods via these objects. In fact, the motivation for
    this surgery were too many administrative programs that wanted to operate
    on several installations in one invocation and had to resort to ugly
    switcheroo of $ENV{CCM_HOME} to do that.

  - Optional usage of Memoize has been dropped.

  - Documented former private methods ccm_with_option() 
    and ccm_with_text_editor().

1.14  2003-07-22

  - Implemented tied hash interface for VCS::CMSynergy::Object.
    Now you can get/set attributes by treating an V::C::Object like a hash.
    Since this requires every V::C::Object to hold a reference to the sesssion,
    this is only available if Scalar::Util is detected at runtime (so we
    can weaken the referemce).

  - Implemented get_releases()/set_releases() for manipulating the release table.
    Implement property().

  - Fixed 'ye olde text_editor trick on Windows (checked on NT 4.0 and XP):
    CM Synergy seems unable to execute "shell" builtins (like "copy"),
    use "xcopy" instead.

  - Made VCS::CMSynergy work on cygwin (even UseCoprocess works).
    This requires Filesys::CygwinPaths to translate Cygwin path names 
    (e.g. as returned by File::Temp::tempfile()) to Windows path names.

  - Changed record/field separators (used internally by query/finduse/history)
    from \cD/\cG to \cA/\cD, but someone will probably succeed in
    entering these into some attribute. Anyway, avoid \x1C-\x1E as
    they are used by Change Synergy in some attribute of "problem".

  - Added a hint on the usage of new(ui_database_dir => ...).
    Merge pod entries for query_arrayref/query_hashref and 
    history_arrayref/history_hashref.

  - Fixed brown paper bag errors in set_attribute (wrong usage check)
    and set_error (handling of HandleError).

1.12  2003-03-31

  - INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: attribute() has been replaced by two methods 
    get_attribute() and set_attribute().
    attributes() has been renamed to list_attributes().

  - Move VCS::CMSynergy hash keys CCM_HOME, CCM_ADDR and CCM_INI_FILE
    into sub hash env. Change ccmexec to pass it a hash ref with keys/values
    to temporarily add to %ENV instead of passing CCM_HOME.
    Factor ccm() into _ccm() (does all the work except error handling) and
    make ccm() a simple wrapper for it. Get rid of IgnoreError and
    use _ccm for all "internal" calls.
    Document "HandleError" and set_errror().
    Pod: change all method "=item"s to "=head2"; the man page looks slightly
    worse, but the HTML rendering is much better.
    CMSynergy/users.pl: renamed to CMSynergy/update_users.pm.
    Implemented create_attribute(), delete_attribute(), and copy_attribute().

1.10  2002-12-23

  - Document types of options for new().
    Document option `KeepSession' for new().
    Mention correct way to explicity stop a session.
    Implement ccm_addr().
    Make database() lazy.

  - Make it work for ancient Continuus 4.5 (fixes #1681):
      - `ccm ps -rfc_address ADDR' doesn't find the process if host part of ADDR
         is given as name (instead of an IP address); esp. this breaks
         `ccm ps -rfc_address $ccm->{CCM_ADDR}' - used in new()
      - different error messages from `ccm finduse' if object is not in use
      - adjust test cases
    Correctly handle (Raise|Print|Handle)Error when ps() in new() fails.
    Add 'remote_client => 1' to options for new() (causes `-rc' for `ccm start').

1.08  2002-10-10

  - INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: The pseudo keyword "finduse" in query_arrayref()
      and query_hashref() does not return a list of project references
      any more. It now returns a hash which maps proj_vers to relative_path. 
      Similarly, the rows returned by finduse() have changed
      from [ $description, @project_references ]
      to [ $description, \%usage_map ].

  - Converted findpath() to use new finduse(), adjusted t/04finduse.t.
    Convert tests to use Test::More.
    Makefile.PL: don't require Memoize anymore, just recommend it.
    Windows: will sleep(2) _after_ "ccm stop" and _before_ unlinking 
      files_to_unlink (because they may still be "busy" - probably "ccm stop"
      returns _before_ CM Synergy really has ceased operation).
    Fix problem with set_error() that's probably a perl bug 
      (at least for 5.6.1, fixed in 5.8.1, cf #9998, #9739 on rt.perl.org):

        sub foo
        {
           my @x = (2, 1, 0);     # last elem must be false
           return @x if wantarray and @x;
           print "OOPS\n";
        }
        my @foo = foo;

      This will print "OOPS". Somehow wantarray seems to force list context
      onto the right-hand side of "and" - @x will thus evaluate to its
      last element.

1.07  2002-08-30

  - INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: The 3-arg form of attribute() does not return
      the old value any more.

  - Document 3-arg form of attribute().

  - When setting attributes, cope with arbitrary types by looking
      up the super_type recursively until one of the well known types 
      (for which we "just know" whether they need the "text_editor"
      trick )is found.

  - Kludge for annoying `Security violation...' warning on Windows
      (thanks to Peter Kreuz for the explanation what's goin' on).

  - Rewritten output parsing for history_*().

  - Fix typo in types().

  - Add error() and ccm_command() calss/instance methods, prefer
      them in docs over explicit $ccm->{error} or $VCS::CMSynergy::error.

  - Add "ui_database_dir" option to new().

1.05  2002-08-06

  - The Great Renaming: s/CMSyngery/VCS::CMSynergy/g.
    First version uploaded to CPAN.
