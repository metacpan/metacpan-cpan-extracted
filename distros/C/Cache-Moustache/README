NAME
    Cache::Moustache - you'd have to be insane to use a module called
    Cache::Moustache, wouldn't you?

SYNOPSIS
      my $cache = Cache::Moustache->new;
      $cache->set($key, $object);
  
      # later ...
      $object = $cache->get($key);

DESCRIPTION
    If you subscribe to the worse-is-better philosophy, then this is quite
    possibly the best cache module available on CPAN. It's the kind of module
    a five-year-old might write if you gave them a project to write a caching
    module. Not a particularly gifted five-year-old.

    It provides an interface similar to CHI, Cache::Cache and other
    commonly-used caching modules. Thus, via polymorphism, Cache::Moustache
    objects can often (if you're lucky) be used when one of those is expected.

    Why would you want to use such a dumb module instead of something
    brilliant like CHI? Because Cache::Moustache is pretty fast, has a low
    memory footprint (except for the memory required to store the cached
    objects), and has no dependencies. I didn't say "no non-core
    dependencies"; I said no dependencies. This thing doesn't even `use
    strict`. It's basically just a hashref with methods.

    I would have called it Cache::Tiny, but then people might have been
    tempted to actually use it.

  Constructor
    `new(%options)`
        Called as a class method returns a shiny new cache. Called as an
        object (instance) method, just returns $self.

        Supported options:

        default_expires_in
            The length of time (in seconds) before a cached value should be
            considered expired. The default is an hour. If you specify -1,
            then things will never expire. If you specify 0, that's dumb, so
            Cache::Moustache will assume that you meant an hour.

        clone_references
            If true, then Cache::Moustache will clone any references you ask
            it to cache. This feature uses the `dclone` function from
            Storable, so violates Cache::Moustache's "no dependencies" rule.
            Yeah, we're so cool we don't even follow our own rules!

            This slows down the cache, so don't use it unless you have to. (I
            only added this feature to pass some test cases, I don't actually
            want to use it myself.)

  Methods
    `set($key, $value, $expires_in)`
        Stores something in the cache. $expires_in is an optional argument
        that allows you to override *default_expires_in*. You can use strings
        like "3 minutes" like what Cache::Cache supports, but I don't
        recommend it.

        Cache::Moustache uses keys beginning with "~~~~" for its own internal
        purposes. If you try to store a value with a key like that, no error
        will be thrown, but it will not be stored; the value will effectively
        expire instantly.

    `get($key)`
        Retrieve the value associated with a key (unless it's expired).

    `remove($key)`
        Removes a key/value pair from the cache. Returns the number of pairs
        removed (one or none).

    `clear`
        Empty everything from the cache. Returns the number of key/value pairs
        removed.

    `purge`
        Remove any expired key/value pairs from the cache. Returns the number
        of pairs removed.

    `size`
        Returns the number of items in the cache (including expired items that
        have not been purged). Note that unlike Cache::Cache and CHI, it does
        not return the total size of all items in bytes.

    `size`
        Returns the number of items in the cache (including expired items that
        have not been purged). Note that unlike Cache::Cache and CHI, it does
        not return the total size of all items in bytes.

    `get_keys`
        Returns the keys of the items in the cache (including expired items
        that have not been purged).

    `isa($class)`
        Returns true if $class is one of 'Cache::Moustache', 'Cache',
        'Cache::Cache', 'Cache::FastMmap', 'Cache::Ref', 'CHI' or
        'Mojo::Cache'.

        In other words, it tells great big porky pie lies.

    Calling any other method returns nothing, but does not die.
