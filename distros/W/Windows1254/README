NAME

  Windows1254 - Native Encoding Support by Traditional Scripting

SYNOPSIS

  # encoding: Windows1254
  use Windows1254;
  print "Hello, world wide market!\n";

  # "no Windows1254;" not supported

DESCRIPTION

  The Windows1254 software provides character-oriented Perl environment on the
  native encoding, by traditional scripting that we know.

  - Character oriented regular expression and runtime routines
  - Character oriented Windows1254::* subroutines
      and
  - Byte oriented CORE::* built-in functions
  - Byte oriented regular expression on /b modifier

  Information processing model beginning with Perl3 or this software.

  In UNIX Everything is a File
  - In UNIX everything is a stream of bytes
  - In UNIX the filesystem is used as a universal name space

  Native Encoding Scripting
  - native encoding of file contents
  - native encoding of file name on filesystem
  - native encoding of command line
  - native encoding of environment variable
  - native encoding of API
  - native encoding of network packet
  - native encoding of database

SUBROUTINES

  Old Days -- memories are always beautiful.

    Functions of
    Byte and SBCS -- Traditional Perl Script
    -------------
    eval
    length
    substr
    ord
    reverse
    getc
    index
    rindex
    pos
    m//
    s///
    split //
    tr///
    qr//
    -------------

  Today -- some memories are beautiful, others are not.
           (I don't say what are not;)

  - Data typing by switching operators, like traditional Perl style
  - Text data by Character Oriented Subroutines
  - Binary data by Byte Oriented Functions
  - /b modifier was introduced via JPerl
  - Multibyte Character Support by Traditional Scripting, in almost all cases
