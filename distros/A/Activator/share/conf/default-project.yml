# Files listed here will be copied from ${conf_dir} to ${sync_conf_dir}. Additionally:
# - If the file looks like a YAML file (ends in .ya?ml), variable
#   replacement is performed and the file is written as the same name.
# - If the file looks like a Template Toolkit file (ends in .tt), it
#   is processed with your project config and written with .tt stripped off.
#
# It is OK to have deep dir paths relative to ${conf_dir}. They will be preserved.
#
# Note that most projects need at least these two files listed here:
# one to configure every catalyst thing that is not Activator aware
# (usually ${project_alias}-catalyst.yml), and one to have the multi-
# functional project registry (usually ${project_alias}-registry.yml).
#
# Note also that this is a great place for a log4perl.conf and your
# Activator::Dictionary files (but don't list dictionary files here,
# list them in the Activator: Dictionary: section below)
