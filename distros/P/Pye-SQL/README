NAME
    Pye::SQL - Log with Pye into MySQL, PostgreSQL or SQLite

SYNOPSIS
            use Pye::SQL;

            my $pye = Pye::SQL->new(
                    db_type => 'mysql', # or 'pgsql' or 'sqlite'
                    database => 'my_log_database',
                    table => 'myapp_logs'
            );

            # now start logging
            $pye->log($session_id, "Some log message", { data => 'example data' });

            # inspect the logs from the command line
            pye -b SQL -t mysql -d my_log_database -T myapp_logs

DESCRIPTION
    This package provides a relational SQL backend for the Pye logging
    system. It currently supports MySQL, PostgreSQL and SQLite.

    All of these database systems will require prior creation of the target
    database and table. Read on for notes and suggestions for each supported
    database system.

  USING THE pye COMMAND LINE UTILITY
    The pye command line utility used to inspect logs supports basic options
    that are consistent across all backends. Anything else you provide is
    passed to the "new( %options )" constructor,

  MySQL
    When creating a table for logs, use something like this:

            CREATE TABLE logs (
                    session_id VARCHAR(60) NOT NULL,
                    date DATETIME(6) NOT NULL,
                    text TEXT NOT NULL,
                    data TEXT
            );

            CREATE INDEX logs_per_session ON logs (session_id);

    For the "session_id" and "text" columns, note that the data type
    definition is purely a suggestion. Use your own judgment as to which
    data types to use, and what lengths, according to your application.

  PostgreSQL
    It is recommended to use PostgreSQL version 9.3 and up, supporting JSON
    or JSONB columns. When creating a table for logs, use something like
    this:

            CREATE TABLE logs (
                    session_id VARCHAR(60) NOT NULL,
                    date TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL,
                    text TEXT NOT NULL,
                    data JSON
            );

            CREATE INDEX ON logs (session_id);

    If using v9.4 or up, "data" might better be a "JSONB" column. As with
    MySQL, use your own judgment for the data type and length of
    "session_id" and "text", according to your application.

    If you're planning on running your own queries on the "data" column, you
    will need to create an index on it. Read PostgreSQL's online
    documentation on JSON data types for more information.

  SQLite
    When using SQLite as a backend, create the following table structure:

            CREATE TABLE logs (
                    session_id TEXT NOT NULL,
                    date TEXT NOT NULL,
                    text TEXT NOT NULL,
                    data TEXT
            );

            CREATE INDEX logs_per_session ON logs (session_id);

    Note that, as opposed to other database systems, SQLite will take the
    path to the database file as the "database" parameter, instead of a
    database name. You can also provide ":memory:" for an in-memory
    database.

CONSTRUCTOR
  new( %options )
    Create a new instance of this class. The following options are
    supported:

    *   db_type - the type of database ("mysql", "pgsql" or "sqlite"),
        required

    *   database - the name of the database to connect to, defaults to
        "logs" (if using SQLite, this will be the path to the database file)

    *   table - the name of the table to log into, defaults to "logs"

    The following options are supported by MySQL and PostgreSQL:

    *   host - the host of the database server, defaults to 127.0.0.1

    *   port - the port of the database server, defaults to 3306 for MySQL,
        5432 for PostgreSQL

OBJECT METHODS
    The following methods implement the Pye role, so you should refer to
    "Pye" for their documentation. Some methods, however, have some
    backend-specific notes, so keep reading.

  log( $session_id, $text, [ \%data ] )
    If "\%data" is provided, it will be encoded to JSON before storing in
    the database.

  session_log( $session_id )
  list_sessions( [ \%opts ] )
    Takes all options defined by Pye. The "sort" option, however, takes a
    standard "ORDER BY" clause definition, e.g. "id ASC". This will default
    to "date DESC".

CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT
    "Pye" requires no configuration files or environment variables.

DEPENDENCIES
    "Pye" depends on the following CPAN modules:

    *   Carp

    *   DBI

    *   JSON::MaybeXS

    *   Role::Tiny

    You will also need the appropriate driver for your database:

    *   DBD::mysql for MySQL

    *   DBD::Pg for PostgreSQL

    *   DBD::SQLite for SQLite
