=head1 NAME

ansiprintf - ANSI terminal sequence aware printf command

=head1 SYNOPSIS

ansiprintf format args ...

=head1 VERSION

Version 2.06

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This command is a simple wrapper command for L<Text::ANSI::Printf>
library.  According to the format given in the first argument, it
formats and outputs the remaining arguments.

Even if the string given as an argument contains ANSI terminal
sequences, the formatting is done based on the visible width on the
screen.

For example, next command

    printf '|%-5s|%-5s|%-5s|\n' Red Green Blue

will print

    |Red  |Green|Blue |

and

    ansiprintf '|%-5s|%-5s|%-5s|\n' \
        $'\e[31mRed\e[m' $'\e[32mGreen\e[m' $'\e[34mBlue\e[m'

will produce same result with colored arguments.

You can give colored arguments with L<ansiecho(1)> command:

    ansiprintf '|%-5s|%-5s|%-5s|\n' $(ansiecho -cR Red -cG Green -cB Blue)

but this can be done with just L<ansiecho(1)>:

    ansiecho -f '|%-5s|%-5s|%-5s|' -cR Red -cG Green -cB Blue

In addition to handling ANSI terminal sequences, L<ansisprintf> has
the following features.

=over 4

=item WIDE and COMBINING CHARACTERS

Asian wide characters are formatted according to the width displayed
on the screen.  Combining characters in other languages are also
handled correctly.

=item UNICODE CHARACTERS

You can give Unicode character in parameter strings by its name
(C<"\N{ALARM CLOCK}">) or code (C<"\N{U+23F0}">).

=item ARGUMENT REORDERING

You can specify the argument by position specifier like C<%2$s %1ds>.
Width, precision, vector string parameter also take position
specifier.

=back

This command supports all other features provided by the Perl
interpreter.  See L<perlfunc/sprintf> or `perldoc -f sprintf` for more
information.
