Directory-Iterator-PP version 1.000
==================================

This is a simple, efficient way to get a recursive list of all files under a
specified directory.

It implements a typical iterator interface, making it simple to convert code
that processes a list of files to use this instead.  The directory is read
as the list is consumed, so memory overhead is minimal.

This module implements the pure-perl backend, with comparable performance to
File::Find; the XS backend is a few times faster.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
