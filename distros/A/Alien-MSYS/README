NAME

    Alien::MSYS - Tools required for GNU style configure scripts on Windows

VERSION

    version 0.07

SYNOPSIS

    from Perl:

     use Alien::MSYS;
     # runs uname from MSYS
     my $uname = mysy { `uname` };

    From Prompt/Makefile

     C:\> perl -MAlien::MSYS -e msys_run uname

DESCRIPTION

    MSYS provides minimal shell and POSIX tools on Windows to enable GNU
    style configure scripts to run (the type usually generated by
    autoconf). This module aims to provide an interface for using MSYS on
    Windows and act as a no-op on Unix like operating systems which already
    have that capability. If you use this module, I recommend that you list
    this as a prerequisite only during MSWin32 installs.

    When installing, this distribution will look for an existing MSYS using
    the following methods in this order:

    environment variable PERL_ALIEN_MSYS_BIN

      If set, this environment variable should be set to the root of MSYS
      (NOT MinGW). For example, if you have MinGW / MSYS installed on D:
      you might use this:

       C:\> set PERL_ALIEN_MSYS_BIN=D:\MinGW\msys\1.0\bin

      Keep in mind that this environment variable is consulted during both
      install and at run-time, so it is advisable to set this in the System
      Properties control panel.

    search PATH for mingw-get.exe

      First Alien::MSYS searches the PATH environment variable for the
      mingw-get.exe program, which is a common method for installing MinGW
      and MSYS. From there if it can deduce the location of MSYS it will
      use that.

    try C:\MinGW\msys\1.0\bin

      This is usually the default location, so Alien::MSYS will try this
      directory even if it isn't found by another method.

    Use desktop shortcut for MinGW Installer

      Usually when you install the MinGW installer it creates a shortcut on
      the desktop. if Win32::Shortcut is installed (it is an optional
      dependency), then Alien::MSYS can use that information to determine
      the location of MSYS.

    If MSYS cannot be found using any of these methods, then it will
    download and install MSYS in this distribution's share directory (via
    File::ShareDir).

FUNCTIONS

 msys

     # get the uname from MSYS
     my $uname = msys { `uanem` };
     
     # run with GNU make from MSYS instead of
     # dmake from Strawberry Perl
     msys { system 'make' };

    This function takes a single argument, a code reference, and runs it
    with the correctly set environment so that calls to the system function
    or the qx quote like operator will use MSYS instead of the default
    environment.

 msys_run

     # pass command through @ARGV
     C:\> perl -MAlien::MSYS -e msys_run uname
     
     # pass command through @_
     C:\> perl -MAlien::MSYS -e "msys_run 'make'; msys_run 'make install'"

    This function runs a command with the MSYS environment. It gets the
    command and arguments either as passed to it, or if none are passed the
    the command is expected to be in @ARGV.

    If the command fails then it will exit with a non-zero error code. This
    is useful, in the second example above if either make or make install
    fails, then the whole command will fail, also make install will not be
    attempted unless make succeeds.

 msys_path

    This function returns the full path to the MSYS bin directory.
