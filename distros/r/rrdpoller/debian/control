Description: Check for thresholds exceeding values in RRD files data
 This Perl module is capable of extracting some RRD information and to
 detect if the current value of a datasource is exeeding some
 thresholds using different algorithms and the help of past values of
 the same or other datasource.

Description: Can poll RRD files and do some thresholds checks on them
 rrdpoller allows you to poll RRD files and get current value of a
 given datasource. Additionally it implement some advanced checks able
 to use past values to decide if the current one is out of threshold
 or not.

 The main purpose of this tool is to do the interface between an
 existing monitoring system like BigBrother, Nagios or Mon and a set
 of RRD graphs generated by some specialized data collectors like
 rrdcollect, Cricket and such. Thus you can build a very modular
 monitoring/trend architecture without the need of double polling.
