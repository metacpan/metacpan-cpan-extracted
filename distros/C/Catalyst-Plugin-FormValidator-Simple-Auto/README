DESCRIPTION
    This plugin provide auto validation to Plugin::FormValidator::Simple.

    You can define validation profiles into config or YAML file, and no
    longer have to write it in actions.

BUNDLING ERROR MESSAGES
    With 0.08 or earlier version, you need define validator profiles and
    error messages in separately.

    So, you had to write two settings like this:

        # profiles.yml
        action1:
          param1:
            - NOT_BLANK
        
    # messages.yml
        action1:
          param1:
            NOT_BLANK: param1 is required!

    It's bothered!

    Since 0.09, you can place error messages in profiles config.

    Above two configs is equals to:

        # profiles.yml
        action1:
          param1:
            - rule: NOT_BLANK
              message: param1 is required!

METHODS

  form_messages
  form_messages( 'key' );
    Return error messages about current validator profile.

    If the key isn't presented, return all messages as hash.
