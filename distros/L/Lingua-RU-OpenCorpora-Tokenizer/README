NAME
    Lingua::RU::OpenCorpora::Tokenizer - tokenizer for OpenCorpora project

SYNOPSIS
        my $tokens = $tokenizer->tokens($text);

        my $bounds = $tokenizer->tokens_bounds($text);

DESCRIPTION
    This module tokenizes input texts in Russian language.

    Note that it uses probabilistic algorithm rather than trying to parse
    the language. It also uses some pre-calculated data freely provided by
    OpenCorpora project.

    NOTE: OpenCorpora periodically provides updates for this data. Checkout
    "opencorpora-update-tokenizer" script that comes with this distribution.

    The algorithm is this:

    1. Split text into chars.
    2. Iterate over the chars from left to right.
    3. For every char get its context (see CONTEXT).
    4. Find probability for the context in vectors file (see "VECTORS FILE")
    or use the default value - 0.5.

  CONTEXT
    In terms of this module context is just a binary vector, currently
    consisting of 17 elements. It's calculated for every character of the
    text, then it gets converted to decimal representation and then it's
    checked against "VECTORS FILE". Every element is a result of a simple
    function like "_is_latin", "_is_digit", "_is_bracket" and etc. applied
    to the input character and few characters around it.

  VECTORS FILE
    Contains a list of vectors with probability values showing the chance
    that given vector is a token boundary.

    Built by OpenCorpora project from semi-automatically annotated corpus.

  HYPHENS FILE
    Contains a list of hyphenated Russian words. Used in vectors
    calculations.

    Built by OpenCorpora project from semi-automatically annotated corpus.

  EXCEPTIONS FILE
    Contains a list of char sequences that are not subjects to tokenizing.

    Built by OpenCorpora project from semi-automatically annotated corpus.

  PREFIXES FILE
    Contains a list of common prefixes for decompound words.

    Built by OpenCorpora project from semi-automatically annotated corpus.

    NOTE: all files are stored as GZip archives and are not supposed to be
    edited manually.

METHODS
  new(%args)
    Constructs and initializes new tokenizer object.

    Arguments are:

    data_dir
        Path to a directory with OpenCorpora data. Optional. Defaults to
        distribution directory (see File::ShareDir).

  tokens($text [, $options])
    Takes text as input and splits it into tokens. Returns a reference to an
    array of tokens.

    You can also pass a hashref with options as a second argument. Current
    options:

    threshold
        Minimal probability value for tokens boundary. Boundaries with lower
        probability are excluded from consideration.

        Default value is 1, which makes tokenizer do splitting only when
        it's confident.

  tokens_bounds($text)
    Takes text as input and finds bounds of tokens in the text. It doesn't
    split the text into tokens, it just marks where tokens could be.

    Returns an arrayref of arrayrefs. Inner arrayref consists of two
    elements: boundary position in text and probability.
