SDL::App::FPS:

* freeze_time() destroys time warp ramping, it should save it and
  unfreeze_time() should restore it
* the time per frame currently (on my system) sways wildly from 11 to 47 ms
  when trying to draw at most 60 fps. This probably accounts for the jerky
  movement in the demo application. Not sure if this is a kernel-timer problem
  or something in my code. I guess I need somehow sub-ms delay or at least an
  delay routine that does not suddenly delay for 10 or 20 ms longer than it
  should...(Hm, disabling xmms and any background app still does not help...)
  Update: Ksysgaurd (KDE applet monitoring CPU and memory) is causing the
  jerky delays, since it does need quite some time every 2 seconds. However,
  since optimisations took place the problem is no longer as apparent as it
  used to be (read: when the delay caused by KSysGuard plus time to draw a
  frame falls under a certain threshold, my eyes no longer see jerky stops.
  Raise the delay by a couple ms, and it is very noticable...funny human
  sensor equipment...)
  However, since we can't sleep much under 5 ms, and sometimes sleep much
  longer than planned, either a better Delay() or some better tracking of
  the sleep times is neccessary. Currently the fps cap stops working at about
  300 FPS, where we will start burnign 100% CPU to achive as much FPS as
  possible, which we wanted to avoid. However, capping at 300 FPS already is
  overkill....120 FPS or less (monitor refresh!) is much more usefull...
* there seems to be a bug with the FPS monitoring, it often goes to 6-digit
  FPS figures and stops to display the real FPS under 10 FPS.

Please send me test-reports, your experiences with this and your ideas - I love
to hear about my work!
