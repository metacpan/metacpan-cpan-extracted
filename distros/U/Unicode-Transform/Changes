Revision history for Perl module Unicode::Transform.

0.51  Wed Mar  7 21:37:08 2012
    - avoid "use vars".

0.50  Sun Jul 31 10:28:09 2011
    - fix the tarball with world writable files.

0.40  Mon Jan 10 13:19:14 2011
    - unitrans.h: provision against the case when UTF8_ALLOW_* flags
                  may be undefined in future.

0.34  Sat Sep 10 11:58:14 2005
    - ord_in_utf32(be|le): avoided promotion from 32-bit int to 64-bit UV.
     (Note: but no test for UV > 0xFFFF_FFFF is included yet.)

0.33  Tue Aug 30 21:27:30 2005
    - improvement of documentation.
    - added ext32bit.t (for UV within 0x8000_0000..0xFFFF_FFFF).
    - added META.yml.

0.32  Sun Nov 30 19:57:01 2003
    - modified doc.
    - UTF-32BE,LE : chr_utf32(be|le) now cope with code points
      in range of 0x8000_0000..0xFFFF_FFFF.
      (ord_utf32(be|le) have been 32-bit safe, then chr_ will be so.)
    - added u32.t.

0.31  Sat Nov 15 21:22:22 2003
    - doc fix: should be chr_utf8mod() and ord_utf8mod(), but not /mode\z/.

0.30  Sat Nov 15 15:47:29 2003
    - new: 8 x 8 conversion functions, <something>_to_<something>.
      (added 50 functions; 14 functions, named unicode_to_<something>
       and <something>_to_unicode, have been already supported.)
    - new: ord_<something> and chr_<something> functions (now improved
      and documented)
    - fixed: unicode_to_<something>(), ord_unicode():
      * \x{D800}-\x{DFFF}\x{FFFE}\x{FFFF} and partial octets are
        no longer regarded as NULL (U+0000).
      * Partial octets are treated as illegal (no longer as NULL).

0.23  Sun Nov  9 17:25:36 2003
    - fixed: unicode_to_utfcp1047() and utfcp1047_to_unicode() did not
      cope with CODEREF correctly.
    - fixed: chr_utfcp1047() was buggy.
    - added ord_*() functions.
    - added chr.t and ord.t.
    - added G_EVAL in XSUB code.
    - modified test.t avoiding a non-character \x{10ffff}.

    - test.t: tests 25..28 are commented out.
