    Distribution
    * Homepage is now metacpan
    * Now testing Strawberry Perl with AppVeyor
    * Kwalitee fix (Patrice Clement) [github 14]

20140709  Wed Jul  9 16:28:37 PDT 2014
    New Features
    * The "git" scheme is supported. (Schwern)
    * svn, ssh and svn+ssh schemes are supported. [rt.cpan.org 57490] (Schwern)
    * Added a --schemeless option to urifind. (Schwern)

    Bug Fixes
    * http:// is no longer matched [rt.cpan.org 63283] (Schwern)

    Backwards Incompatibilities
    * Previously, URIs stringified to their canonical version.  Now
      they stringify as written.  This results in less loss of
      information.  For example.  "Blah HTTP:://FOO.COM" previously
      would stringify as "http://foo.com/" and now it will stringify
      as "HTTP://FOO.COM".  To restore the old behavior you can call
      $uri->canonical. (Schwern)

    Distribution Changes
    * No longer using URI::URL. (Schwern)
    * Now requires URI 1.60 for Unicode support. (Schwern)


20140702  Wed Jul  2 13:41:47 PDT 2014
    New Features
    * IDNA (aka Unicode) domains are now supported. [github 3] (GwenDragon)
    * The list of TLDs for schemeless matching has been updated. [github 3] (GwenDragon)

    Bug Fixes
    * Handle balanced [], {} and quotes in addition to (). [rt.cpan.org 85053] (Schwern)
    * Don't mangle IPv6 URLs. [rt.cpan.org 85053] (Schwern)
    * Schemeless is more accurate about two letter TLDs. [github 3] (GwenDragon)

    Distribution Changes
    * Switched the issue tracker to Github. (Schwern)


20111103  Thu Nov  3 12:14:21 PDT 2011

      other text.  [rt.cpan.org 71658]

    New Features
    * Balanced parens in URIs are no longer stripped.  Example:
      "http://example.com/foo(bar)"  (Merten Falk)

    * URLs with leading dots, pluses and minuses are now found.
      [rt.cpan.org 57032]

20100211  Thu Feb 11 04:02:26 PST 2010

    * Finding URIs inside brackets was pretty badly broken by
      the last release.  (Michael Peters)


20090319  Thu Mar 19 12:17:53 PDT 2009

      them in one fell swoop. (Mike Schilli) [rt.cpan.org 20486]

      RFC 3986 appendix C. [rt.cpan.org 20483]

    * Minimum Perl version is now 5.6.0.


0.16 Fri Jul 22 06:00:24 EDT 2005
    - Oops, make the URI::Find::Schemeless->top_level_domain_re case
      insensitive, as it should be and the docs claimed it was.  Thanks
      to Todd Eigenschink.


0.15 Tue Mar 22 07:23:17 EST 2005
    - Have all functions croak if invoked with the wrong number of
      arguments.  Add URI::Find->badinvo.
        https://rt.cpan.org/NoAuth/Bug.html?id=1845
    - Mention DARREN's urifind script in the man page.
    - Oops, URI::URL::strict was turned on and left on.  Put it back the
      way you found it.  Thanks to Chris Nandor.
        https://rt.cpan.org/NoAuth/Bug.html?id=11906
    - Schemeless.pm:
        - Find '<x>intag.com</x>'.
        - Get $tldRe from a new class method, ->top_level_domain_re.
        - Update top level domain list.


0.14 Sat Oct  9 08:20:04 EDT 2004
    - Add copyright notice.
    - Add ] to main $cruftSet, } to schemeless $cruftSet, for
      [http://square.com] and {brace.com}.
    - quotemeta() $cruftSet.


0.13 Mon Jul  1 10:37:54 EDT 2002
    - Don't find any schemeless URIs with a plain URI::Find.  Previously
      it'd find ones which started with "ftp." and "www.", but it was
      more prone to false positives than URI::Find::Schemeless.
    - Have schemeless_to_schemed use http:// except in the specific case
      in which it uses ftp://.  Remove URI::Find::Schemeless's version.


0.12 Wed Mar 20 14:39:21 EST 2002
    - Improve the "wrap each URI found in an HTML anchor" example.
    - Release a new version so CPAN sees the maintainer change.


0.11 Thu Jul 26 14:43:49 EDT 2001
    - Michael passed the module to Roderick for maintenance.
    - Improve test suite.
    - Tweak URI::Find::Schemeless not to find Foo.p[ml].


0.10  Mon Jul 10 20:14:08 EDT 2000
    - Rearchitected the internals to allow simple subclassing
    - Added URI::Find::Schemeless (thanks Roderick)


0.04  Sat Feb 26 09:05:11 GMT 2000
    - Added # to the uric set of characters so HTML anchors are caught.


0.03  Tue Feb  1 16:15:22 EST 2000
    - Added some heuristic discussion to the docs.
    - Added some heuristics to avoid picking up perl module names
    - Improved schemeless URI heuristic to avoid picking up
      usenet board names.
    - Handling the <URL:...> case better as suggested in RFC 2396 Apdx E
    - Added ; to the cruft heuristic


0.02  Tue Feb  1 13:11:56 EST 2000
    - Added heuristic to handle 'URL:http://www.foo.com'
    - Added heuristic to handle trailing quotes.


0.01  Mon Jan 31 19:12:23 EST 2000
    - First working version released to CPAN.
