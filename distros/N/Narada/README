    Narada - framework for ease deploy and support microservice projects

VERSION

    This document describes Narada version v2.3.8

SYNOPSIS

        #--- Create new project
        ~ $ narada-new my_proj
        ... New project will be created using template (from git repo).
    
        #--- Develop project as usually, until it's ready to run
        ~ $ cd my_proj
        ~/my_proj $
        ... Now you in project's source dir with git repo.
        ... You can develop this project in any way and language.
    
        #--- Make release and deploy it to check how it works
        ... NOTE: This operation is usually automated by script(s) provided
        ... by "project template" used while creating new project.
        ... Create file 0.1.0.migrate with instructions how to migrate between
        ... empty directory and version 0.1.0 of your project plus any related
        ... 0.1.0.{patch,tgz,etc.} files if you need them.
        ... Copy these files into .release/ subdirectory of directory where
        ... you want to deploy this version of project, for ex. in _live/.
        ~/my_proj $ cp 0.1.0.* _live/.release/
        ~/my_proj $ cd _live
        ~/my_proj/_live $ narada-install 0.1.0
        ... Now you in project's deploy directory, with config files, logs,
        ... running services, data files, etc. and you can check how it works.
    
        #--- Upgrade or downgrade project
        ... Repeat same steps to prepare 0.2.0.migrate and save into .release/.
        ~/my_proj/_live $ narada-install 0.2.0
        ... You can downgrade if something goes wrong.
        ~/my_proj/_live $ narada-install 0.1.0

        [LOCKED] ~/my_proj/_live $
        ... Now all project applications will be blocked on next attempt
        ... to read/write any file or database, so you can safely change
        ... project files or databases, etc.
        [LOCKED] ~/my_proj/_live $ exit
        ~/my_proj/_live $
        ... Now project applications will be unblocked and continue to work.

        ~/my_proj $ rm -rf _live/

DESCRIPTION

    Narada was designed for ease development, deploy and support for
    medium/big server-side project or large amount of small projects (used
    in microservice architecture). It's a framework which define the way to
    manage your project (which doesn't really depend on your project's
    nature), and doesn't restrict your project's implementation in any way.
    With Narada you can create any projects using any programming languages
    as long as your project conform to Narada interface and work in *NIX.

    Typical example of project which wins a lot when managed by Narada is
    web site backend or network service, which consists of several
    applications (even written in different programming languages) with
    different entry points (HTTP, RPC, cron, email), which all should have
    common runtime environment, logs, etc.

    In short, Narada dictates where your project should keep and how it
    should work with: config files, logs, locks, temporary and persistent
    data files, required external configuration for cron, qmail, databases.
    All of this is called "Narada interface", and if your project conform
    to it then you can also use a lot of handy command-line tools provided
    by Narada to deploy, backup and manage your project.

    There are few helper Narada::* modules for Perl which helps you to
    conform Narada interface in your Perl modules/scripts; for other
    languages you may want to create similar helpers, but this isn't
    required - Narada interface is simple and can be easily conformed
    without using special helpers (it was designed that way to make it ease
    to conform to Narada interface even in shell scripts).

    To use Narada you'll also need to learn format of .migrate files used
    to describe project's upgrade/downgrade operations (see "SYNTAX" in
    App::migrate) and choose which "project template" to use for your new
    project (for ex. see default template narada-base
    <https://github.com/powerman/narada-base>; you can modify it with
    plugins or develop your own template from scratch).

 Main features

    Templates and plugins for project source.

      You can choose one of existing templates when starting new project,
      and even modify some of them using plugins - or made your own
      templates or plugins if you often develop similar projects. Both
      templates and plugins are implemented by merging remote repositories,
      so if they will change after you've started your project you can
      easily update it by fetching and merging them again.

    You can continue using your favorite workflow.

      While narada-new tool and existing project templates/plugins use Git,
      you may opt out and don't use them. This is only Narada tool which do
      something with your project's source directory (all other tools work
      only with project's deploy directory) and it's completely optional.
      You can create new project using Mercurial or even without using any
      VCS, and use any workflow you like. All you need is produce .migrate
      and related files as result of releasing every version of your
      project, including ephemeral development versions which you may
      release many times per day.

    Provide file/directory structure for deployed project.

      Some choices are already made for you: where and how to store project
      configuration, temporary and persistent data files, logs, locks,
      backups, current version number. This file/directory structure was
      designed to make it ease to use from any programming language
      (including shell scripts) and provide several valuable features like
      reliable upgrades and backups.

    Reliable project upgrade and downgrade.

      Narada use .migrate files to describe operations needed to upgrade
      and (required!) downgrade project. While usual development process
      you'll run these operations each time you wanna check how your
      changes work, i.e. this will happens dozens (if not hundreds) of
      times while you're developing next version, so both upgrade and
      downgrade operations are usually guaranteed to be well-tested before
      releasing each next version.

    Different project installations have different configurations.

      Changes in your local configuration won't be occasionally sent with
      next update to production server. And you won't have any issues
      because of config files added into your repo with project sources
      because in Narada projects config files exists only in project's
      deploy directory.

    Ease project setup after installation/update.

      Narada provide tools to update project's external setup (cron tasks,
      qmail handlers for incoming emails, MySQL scheme) according to
      current project's configuration.

    Reliable services.

      Run your FastCGI or RPC daemons with guaranteed restart after crash.
      Narada project may have own services, always running in background.
      By default we use runit <http://smarden.org/runit/> for supervising
      project's services, but other similar supervisors like daemontools or
      s6 also can be used.

    All project's applications have common log(s).

      When your project consists of many applications/scripts or run many
      processes of same application it's important to have single common
      log for all of them. To implement this each Narada project usually
      run own log service. By default we use socklog
      <http://smarden.org/socklog/> (syslog-compatible daemon) to receive
      logs from all project's applications and svlogd tool from runit
      <http://smarden.org/runit/> to manage logs (rotate, filter, group
      records in separate files, etc.).

    All project's applications have common lock.

      This guarantee live project's consistency while backup, update or
      manual maintenance. NOTE: While Narada provide and use this lock file
      in it's own tools it's your responsibility to always get shared lock
      on that lock file before doing read/write of any project's files or
      databases - if you won't do this you'll break mentioned above
      consistency guarantee.

    Consistent and fast project backup.

      Narada interface include shared/exclusive project locking, which let
      us guarantee backup consistency between project files and databases.

      Narada backup tool support incremental backups both for files and
      database, which makes it possible to backup most projects in few
      seconds - your website visitors won't even notice your daily/hourly
      backup!

    Backward compatibility.

      Whenever possible, projects created using previous Narada versions
      will be supported by latest Narada (but newly added tools may not
      work with such an old projects).

 Important changes since previous versions

  Narada 1.x

    Narada 1 was created when Git and Mercurial wasn't exists yet, so it
    doesn't use repository for project sources. Also it doesn't separate
    project's source vs deploy directories and run project's applications
    in directory with it sources - this was perfectly fine for projects
    developed in script languages like Perl without using VCS. The
    narada-new tool used to create Narada 1 projects is still available but
    it was renamed to narada-new-1.

    Also Narada 1 provide several tools used to generate, email/upload and
    apply patches for project's directory - this was the way to both deploy
    new version to server and distribute changes to other developers in
    team. These tools has no use in current Narada, but they still exists
    for compatibility with Narada 1 projects: narada-diff, narada-release,
    narada-patch-remote, narada-patch-send, narada-patch-pull,
    narada-patch.

    Files&directories structure also was changed since Narada 1.x, see
    Changes <https://metacpan.org/changes/distribution/Narada> in version
    2.0.0 for more details.

    This documentation describe current Narada, check documentation for
    latest Narada 1
    <https://metacpan.org/pod/release/POWERMAN/Narada-v1.4.5/lib/Narada.pm>
    if you're still using Narada 1 projects.

EXAMPLE

    Create new project:

        ~ $ narada-new hello_world
        ... a lot of Git output skipped
        ~ $ cd hello_world/
        ~/hello_world $ ls -AF
        build*  deploy*  doc/  .git/  .gitignore  migrate  release*  t/

    This is project's source directory initialized using default template.
    It provide basic migrate files with all commands needed to create all
    files/directories needed by every deployed Narada project plus few
    scripts: ./release for releasing new versions (both development
    ephemeral versions and tagged final versions) and ./deploy for
    installing them into _live/ subdirectory.

    Cool, we already can release something!

        ~/hello_world $ ./release
        t/build/migrate.t .. 1/1 # Checking migrate
        t/build/migrate.t .. ok
        All tests successful.
        Files=1, Tests=1,  0 wallclock secs ( ... )
        Result: PASS
        ~/hello_world $ ls -AF
        build*  deploy*  doc/  .git/  .gitignore  migrate  release*  .release/
        t/  VERSION
        ~/hello_world $ ls -AF .release/
        0.0.0+b4ff31c.migrate  0.0.0+b4ff31c.patch
        ~/hello_world $ cat VERSION
        0.0.0+b4ff31c

    As you see, your project get unique ephemeral version number in file
    VERSION and this version was released as two files in .release/. Now,
    let's deploy it!

        ~/hello_world $ ./deploy
        Loading .release/0.0.0+b4ff31c.migrate
        ... a lot of executed commands output skipped
        Migration to 0.0.0+b4ff31c completed
        ~/hello_world $ ls -AF
        build*  deploy*  doc/  .git/  .gitignore  _live/  migrate  release*
        .release/  t/  VERSION
        ~/hello_world $ ls -AF _live/
        .backup/  config/  doc/  .lock  .release/  t/  tmp/  var/  VERSION

    The _live/ is project's deploy directory. There are may be many of
    them, even on same development machine in case you develop in several
    branches and wanna have each branch deployed to separate directory, or
    just wanna install simultaneously old and new versions of project and
    compare how they work.

    Okay, we get Narada files&directories structure in _live/, but it
    doesn't have much use for now. Let's add something to our project.

        ~/hello_world $ cat >hello <<EOF
        > #!/usr/bin/perl
        > print "Hello, World!\n";
        > EOF
        ~/hello_world $ chmod +x hello
        ~/hello_world $ git add hello
        ~/hello_world $ ./release && ./deploy
        t/build/migrate.t .. 1/1 # Checking migrate
        t/build/migrate.t .. ok
        All tests successful.
        Files=1, Tests=1,  0 wallclock secs ( ... )
        Result: PASS
        Loading .release/0.0.0+b4ff31c.dirty-1428492362.migrate
        Loading .release/0.0.0+b4ff31c.migrate
        Backuping to .backup/full-0.0.0+b4ff31c.tar
        ...
        Migration to 0.0.0 completed
        ...
        Migration to 0.0.0+b4ff31c.dirty-1428492362 completed

    What just happens? New ephemeral version
    "0.0.0+b4ff31c.dirty-1428492362" was released (it have such a name
    because we didn't committed our changes to the repo yet); then previous
    version "0.0.0+b4ff31c" installed in _live/ was saved in the backup and
    downgraded to version "0.0.0" (which is initial version meaning "empty
    directory"); then that empty directory was upgraded to current version
    "0.0.0+b4ff31c.dirty-1428492362". Look:

        ~/hello_world $ cat VERSION
        0.0.0+b4ff31c.dirty-1428492362
        ~/hello_world $ ls -AF .release/
        0.0.0+b4ff31c.dirty-1428492362.migrate  0.0.0+b4ff31c.migrate
        0.0.0+b4ff31c.dirty-1428492362.patch    0.0.0+b4ff31c.patch
        ~/hello_world $ ls -AF _live/
        .backup/  config/  doc/  hello*  .lock  .release/  t/  tmp/  var/
        VERSION
        ~/hello_world $ cd _live/
        ~/hello_world/_live $ ./hello
        Hello, World!
        ~/hello_world/_live $ cd -
        ~/hello_world $

    Next, let's start using some Narada features, like config files. We'll
    also add migration operation to migrate file to create new config file
    on upgrading to this version and remove it on downgrading from this
    version.

        ~/hello_world $ echo 'add_config my_name Powerman' >> migrate
        ~/hello_world $ cat >hello <<EOF
        > #!/usr/bin/perl
        > use Narada::Config qw( get_config_line );
        > printf "Hello, %s!\n", get_config_line('my_name');
        > EOF
        ~/hello_world $ ./release && ./deploy
        ...
        Loading .release/0.0.0+b4ff31c.dirty-1428493197.migrate
        Loading .release/0.0.0+b4ff31c.dirty-1428492362.migrate
        Backuping to .backup/full-0.0.0+b4ff31c.dirty-1428492362.tar
        ...
        Migration to 0.0.0 completed
        ...
        Migration to 0.0.0+b4ff31c.dirty-1428493197 completed
        ~/hello_world $ cd _live/
        ~/hello_world/_live $ ./hello
        Hello, Powerman!

    In deploy directory we can safely modify config or data files - these
    changes will affect only project deployed in this directory.

        ~/hello_world/_live $ ls -AF config/
        backup/  crontab/  log/  my_name  mysql/  qmail/
        ~/hello_world/_live $ echo Anonymous > config/my_name
        ~/hello_world/_live $ ./hello
        Hello, Anonymous!
        ~/hello_world/_live $ cd -
        ~/hello_world $

    Now, let's release current version tagged with own version number.

        ~/hello_world $ git add migrate
        ~/hello_world $ git commit -m 'add hello'
        ~/hello_world $ ./release --minor
        t/build/migrate.t .. 1/1 # Checking migrate
        t/build/migrate.t .. ok
        All tests successful.
        Files=1, Tests=1,  0 wallclock secs ( ... )
        Result: PASS
        [master 8338faa] Release 0.1.0
         1 file changed, 4 insertions(+)
        ~/hello_world $ cat VERSION
        0.1.0
        ~/hello_world $ ls -AF .release/
        0.0.0+b4ff31c.dirty-1428492362.migrate  0.0.0+b4ff31c.migrate
        0.0.0+b4ff31c.dirty-1428492362.patch    0.0.0+b4ff31c.patch
        0.0.0+b4ff31c.dirty-1428493197.migrate  0.1.0.migrate
        0.0.0+b4ff31c.dirty-1428493197.patch    0.1.0.patch
        ~/hello_world $

    And deploy it on server:

        ~/hello_world $ ssh localhost 'mkdir -p hello_project/.release'
        ~/hello_world $ scp .release/0.1.0.* localhost:hello_project/.release/
        0.1.0.migrate        100% 7105     6.9KB/s   6.9KB/s   00:00
        0.1.0.patch          100% 5223     5.1KB/s   6.9KB/s   00:00
        ~/hello_world $ ssh localhost
        ~ $ cd hello_project/
        ~/hello_project $ ls -AF
        .release/
        ~/hello_project $ ls -AF .release/
        0.1.0.migrate  0.1.0.patch
        ~/hello_project $ narada-install 0.1.0
        Loading .release/0.1.0.migrate
        ...
        Migration to 0.1.0 completed
        ~/hello_project $ ls -AF
        .backup/  config/  doc/  hello*  .lock  .release/  t/  tmp/  var/
        VERSION
        ~/hello_project $ ./hello
        Hello, Powerman!
        ~/hello_project $

    Finally, let's cleanup and uninstall all projects.

    Template used to create this project include some basic cron
    configuration to make daily project backups. And these settings was
    already added to your user's crontab while installing the project. So,
    before removing project directories we should remove this cron setup.

        ~/hello_project $ narada-setup-cron --clean
        ~/hello_project $ cd ..
        ~ $ rm -rf hello_project/
        ~ $ exit
        ~/hello_world $ cd _live/
        ~/hello_world/_live $ narada-setup-cron --clean
        ~/hello_world/_live $ cd ../..
        ~ $ rm -rf hello_world/

INTERFACE

    The "Narada interface" is described here files&directories structure
    for project's deploy directory and some conventions about how they
    should be used. Your project must conform to this interface.

      For example, let's review part of Narada interface related to
      "Consistent and fast project backup." feature.

      "Consistent" require using shared/exclusive file locking on file
      .lock. All Narada does is create that file while installing new
      project and acquire exclusive lock on it while executing
      narada-backup. But to really have consistent backups you must acquire
      shared lock on that file when accessing any project files or database
      in any of your applications! In Perl scripts you can use helper
      module Narada::Lock, and it's not a big deal to manually use flock(2)
      in any other language. If you fail to do this, you backups won't be
      guaranteed to be consistent anymore!

      "Fast" consists of two parts: files and database. To backup project
      files fast you should keep large junk files according to Narada's
      interface - in directories listed in config/backup/exclude, for ex.
      in tmp/. To backup MySQL database fast you should try hard to store
      large amount of data in append-only tables with "auto_increment
      primary key", and add names of these tables to
      config/mysql/dump/incremental.

      All of this will let narada-backup to hold exclusive lock (and thus
      freeze your project while backup) shortest possible time, complete
      safe part of backup task after releasing the lock, and use
      incremental backups to save both time and disk space.

 Directory types

    There are two types of "root" directories in your project: source
    directory and deploy directory.

    The project's source directory isn't part of Narada interface. Only
    tool which work with it is narada-new (which helps you to create new
    project), but you're not required to use it, and even if you use it no
    Narada tools will touch your project's source directory after it will
    be created.

    The project's deploy directory is the one where all files&directories
    defined by Narada interface should exists. Also it's the directory
    where you should run all Narada tools and your project's applications -
    this is required to allow them to find all Narada files&directories
    using paths relative to current directory.

    It's ok to have many source directories (as repo clones for your team)
    and to have many deploy directories (as different installations on same
    or different computers) - for ex. it may be very useful to deploy
    different versions from different Git branches to different deploy
    directories on same development machine.

 Overview of deploy directory structure

    Project templates often include typical directories like doc/ or t/ but
    they isn't part of Narada interface and thus you're free to rename or
    remove them if you like.

    .release/

      Contain .migrate and related files used to upgrade and downgrade
      project while migrating to another version.

    .backup/

      Contain project backups. You can create and manage them yourself, but
      they also will be automatically created before migrating to another
      version and may be automatically used when only way to downgrade
      project is restore previous version from backup. In general it's safe
      to remove backups when you like, but absence of some backups may make
      it impossible to downgrade to some previous version.

    VERSION

      Contain current project version. Required for upgrade and downgrade,
      and will be automatically updated after migration or restoring from
      backup. May be useful for your applications (read-only).

    .lock*

      Several lock files used mostly internally by Narada tools, except for
      the .lock file which should be shared-locked by all your applications
      while they read or write any project's files or databases.

    config/

      Project's configuration (both defined by Narada interface and custom
      settings of your project). May differ in different project's deploy
      directories. While it's possible to modify configuration in all
      deploy directories while project migration, usually most of config
      files modified either manually or by your applications in one deploy
      directory.

    service/

      Used to setup project's services (daemons) and run them using service
      supervisor (runit, daemontools, etc.). Most projects usually have
      just one (log) or a couple (log and fastcgi/http/rpc) services.

    tmp/

      Used for temporary data files. Contents of this directory won't be
      included in backups.

    var/

      Used for persistent data files.

 Deploy

    In "EXAMPLE" above you've seen scripts ./release, ./deploy, files
    migrate and VERSION, directories .release/ and _live/ while working
    with Narada, but all of them was in project's source directory and
    isn't part of Narada interface! All of them was provided by used
    project template, and different templates may implement these tasks in
    different ways - read documentation for chosen project template. Also
    you're free to modify these paths and scripts in any way - template
    provide only starting point, but it's your project's sources and you
    have freedom to do anything you like.

    What is actually part of Narada interface is result of running these
    ./release && ./deploy scripts: file .release/<version>.migrate and
    optional related files (usually named .release/<version>.patch or
    .release/<version>.tgz) in project's deploy directory. No matter how
    you develop, build, compile, release and copy/upload new version to
    deploy directory, the final result should be such file/files.

    .release/<version>.migrate

      These files must contain upgrade and downgrade operations between
      version previous to <version> and <version>, but usually they also
      contain operations for all previous versions up to initial version
      "0.0.0" (meaning "empty directory").

      It's recommended to use semantic versions <http://semver.org/>, but
      except for predefined initial version "0.0.0" you're free to use for
      your project any version numbering scheme you like.

      Files&directories structure conforming to Narada interface must be
      created using upgrade operations in this file when describing upgrade
      from version "0.0.0".

      Narada uses App::migrate to implement project migrations, format of
      .migrate files is documented in "SYNTAX" in App::migrate.

	When you need to convert some data in files or database when
	installing new version you should use .migrate file to run scripts
	which will do this.

	You should not try to do these data migrations automatically on
	first time new version of your project's application starts - both
	because this will make impossible to downgrade quickly and without
	losing data (if you'll provide script which does backward data
	conversion, of course) and you'll have to restore from backup
	instead, and because project migration may include many upgrades at
	once and your application as it was at one of intermediate versions
	wasn't get a chance to run at all.

 Backup

    config/backup/exclude

      Shell patterns (one per line) for files/dirs which shouldn't be
      included in backup. Must contain at least these lines:

          ./.backup/*         to avoid recursively including old backups in new
          ./.lock*            to avoid unlocking while restoring from backup
          ./tmp/*             to conform to Narada interface and not include
                              temporary files in backups

    config/mysql/dump/incremental

      List of database tables (one per line) which can be dumped
      incrementally (according to their "auto_increment primary key"
      field). narada-backup will dump only new records in these tables
      (dumps for older records will be available in existing files in
      .backup/ or var/mysql/).

    config/mysql/dump/empty

      List of database tables (one per line) which records shouldn't be
      included in backup, only scheme.

    config/mysql/dump/ignore

      List of database tables (one per line) which shouldn't be included in
      backup at all (even scheme).

    var/mysql/

      Contain files with last database dump (usually made while last
      backup).

    var/use/

      Keeps current used/unused state recorded by last run of
      narada-setup-* and narada-*-services tools. It will be used by
      narada-restore to setup project after full restore.

    .backup/full.tar

    .backup/incr.tar

      Latest full and incremental backups. To force full backup next time
      just remove .backup/full.tar. See narada-backup for more details.

 Logging

    config/log/type

      Define type of logging: syslog (default if this file not exists) or
      file. If set to syslog then config/log/output should contain path to
      syslog's UNIX socket (like var/log.sock or /dev/log).

      It's recommended to use syslog type and run syslog-compatible log
      service for each project, because it's very hard to correctly
      implement concurrent writes to common log file.

      If set to file then each application in your project must open this
      file in append-only mode, avoid writing single log record using more
      than one write syscall (may happens because of buffered I/O), don't
      use NFS for var/log/… and you anyway may have some issues. One
      possible issue is performance: if you'll conform to Narada interface
      and acquire shared lock on .lock before writing each one line to log
      this may result in noticeable slowdown. Another possible issue
      happens if you avoid locking because of performance issue, but
      without locks it may be impossible to ensure log consistency in
      backups or reliably implement log rotation.

    config/log/output

      File name where project applications should write their logs: either
      UNIX socket (to syslog-compatible daemon) or usual file (or
      /dev/stdout).

    config/log/level

      Current log level, should be one of these strings:

          ERR WARN NOTICE INFO DEBUG DUMP

    var/log/

      This directory contains project log files.

 Cron tasks

    config/crontab/*

      Settings for project's cron tasks, in crontab format.

      When these settings will be installed to system's cron, each command
      will be automatically prefixed by:

          cd /path/to/project/deploy/dir || exit;

      narada-setup-cron update system's cron using settings from these
      files.

 Processing incoming emails

    Only qmail supported at this time.

    config/qmail/*

      Files with qmail configuration (in .qmail format). Commands listed in
      these files (lines beginning with |) will be executed in project's
      deploy directory instead of user's home directory (qmail's default
      behaviour).

    var/qmail/*

      Internally used by narada-setup-qmail.

 Database

    Only MySQL supported at this time.

    config/mysql/db

      Contains one line - name of MySQL database. If this file doesn't
      exists or empty - Narada won't use database.

    config/mysql/login

    config/mysql/pass

      Login/pass for database.

    config/mysql/host

      Host name of database server. if this file doesn't exists or empty
      then usual UNIX socket will be used to connect to MySQL server.

    config/mysql/port

      TCP port of database server.

 Locking

    .lock

      This file should be shared-locked using flock(2) or Narada::Lock or
      narada-lock before accessing any project's files or database by usual
      applications, and exclusive-locked while project's backup, update or
      manual maintenance.

    .lock.new

      This file will be created before trying to acquire exclusive lock on
      .lock. All applications wanted to acquire shared lock on .lock must
      check before that is .lock.new exists and if yes then delay/avoid
      locking .lock. This is needed to guarantee exclusive lock will be
      acquired as soon as possible.

      After exclusive lock will be acquired and critical operations
      requiring it will be completed - .lock.new will be removed.

      If server will be rebooted while waiting for exclusive lock or in the
      middle of critical operations requiring it then file .lock.new won't
      be removed and project applications won't continue to work after
      server reboot until this file will be removed manually or another
      operation requiring exclusive lock will be started and successfully
      finished.

    .lock.bg

      Each project's background process (running as service, or started by
      cron, qmail, etc.) should acquire shared lock on this file. This can
      be easily done using narada-bg tool. This will make possible to
      reliably detect and kill all project's background processes while
      upgrade or downgrade using narada-bg-killall tool.

 Services

    There are several ways to start project's services: manually by running
    narada-start-services - this way they wasn't start automatically after
    server reboot, try to start them every 1 minute from cron if they
    wasn't running yet (usually using config/crontab/service but this file
    isn't part of Narada interface) - this way it may took about 1 minute
    before project services will be started after deploy or server reboot,
    run them as one of system-wide service based on similar
    (runit/daemontools/s6/etc.) supervisor - fastest and most reliable way
    but require root permissions to add new system-wide service.

    config/service/type

      Type of used service supervisor. For now only supported type is
      runit.

    .lock.service

      This lock file is used by narada-start-services to check is services
      already running.
