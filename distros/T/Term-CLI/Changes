    - Fix version number.
        0.05002 might look like "0.05.2", but is in fact "0.50.20".
        Insert a digit to make fix this: "0.051002" translates to
        "0.51.2".

  [Bug Fixes]

    - Fake pager should drain STDIN before exiting.
      This should finally fix the failing test in 
      t/065-Term-CLI-Command-Help.t

        Files modified:

  [Bug Fixes]
    - Separate STDOUT/pager output for help a bit more.
        Also, set "status" to $? regardless of close() result.
        Some tests for status still fail, and I'm suspecting a
        race condition, making close() return "true". If this
        fails as well, then I'll just skip the test. :-(

        Files modified:
            lib/Term/CLI/Command/Help.pm

  [Other Changes]
    - Require specific versions of modules.
        Minimal versions come from Debian jessie (8) install. Wheezy has
        a version of "Moo" that is too old.

        Files modified: (almost all)

  [Bug Fixes]

    - Don't check STDERR on pager error.
        Something's off in checking STDERR when running an external
        pager. Could be race condition? Anyway, we only care about
        propagation of the exit status, so just test that.

        Tests work in my dev. environment, but fail about 30-50% of
        the time on CPAN testers.

    - Fix English-centred error message check.

        Files modified:
            t/075-Term-CLI-History.t

  [Features]

    - Allow empty "pager" (dump to STDOUT)
        Instead of falling back to "cat", fall back to
        raw STDOUT printing. An empty pager list will
        select STDOUT as well.

        Files modified:
            lib/Term/CLI/Command/Help.pm

  [Other Changes]

    - Clean up commented-out code.

    - Add Term::CLI::Argument::Bool

      Files:
        lib/Term/CLI/Argument/Bool.pm

  [Bug Fixes]

    - Fix various (POD and diagnostic message) typos.

    - Don't use POSIX's strtod() and strtol() for number conversions;
      rely on regex and looks_like_number() instead.

      Files: 
        lib/Term/CLI/Argument/Number.pm
        lib/Term/CLI/Argument/Number/Float.pm
        lib/Term/CLI/Argument/Number/Int.pm

    - Tests now force the 'en' language where necessary.
      Error messages are hard to verify without forcing
      a particular language.

      Files:
        lib/Term/CLI/Role/HelpText.pm

    - Fix usage text with variable number of arguments.

      Files:

      Files:
        lib/Term/CLI/Command/Help.pm

    - Fix test on FreeBSD - closes #2

      Error message from "cat" on invalid option differs from
      Linux to FreeBSD. Just check for "cat:" in the error
      message instead.

      Files:
        t/065-Term-CLI-Command-Help.t

    - Fix tests for non-English locales - closes #3

      Tests were assuming that external commands
      communicate their diagnostics in English.

      Files:
        t/065-Term-CLI-Command-Help.t
        t/075-Term-CLI-History.t
