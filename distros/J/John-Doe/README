NAME
    John::Doe - Test case duplicate file names in distribution

SYNOPSIS
      use John::Doe;

DESCRIPTION
    Don't install or use it, except for testing module toolchains.

    This distribution contains files in "lib/", "t/" and "share/" written in
    case variants.

    At the time of release version 0.00 this distribution builds and passes
    all tests.

    On environments with case insensitive filenames only one variant of the
    files survives.
