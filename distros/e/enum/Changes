    - Changed how the constants are defined, to deal with a change in 5.19.3
      "Closures of the form "sub () { $some_variable }" are no longer
       inlined, causing changes to the variable to be ignored by callers of
       the subroutine. [perl #79908]"

1.05 2013-09-06 NEILB

    - Added links to other modules and my review, in SEE ALSO
    - Failed to index, due to clash with PAUSE permissions for Enum module
