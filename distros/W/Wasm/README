SYNOPSIS

    lib/MathStuff.pm:

     package MathStuff;
     
     use strict;
     use warnings;
     use base qw( Exporter );
     use Wasm
       -api => 0,
       -exporter => 'ok',
       -wat => q{
         (module
           (func (export "add") (param i32 i32) (result i32)
             local.get 0
             local.get 1
             i32.add)
           (func (export "subtract") (param i32 i32) (result i32)
             local.get 0
             local.get 1
             i32.sub)
           (memory (export "frooble") 2 3)
         )
       };
     
     1;

    mathstuff.pl:

     use MathStuff qw( add subtract );
     
     print add(1,2), "\n";      # prints 3
     print subtract(3,2), "\n", # prints 1

DESCRIPTION

    WARNING: WebAssembly and Wasmtime are a moving target and the interface
    for these modules is under active development. Use with caution.

    The Wasm Perl dist provides tools for writing Perl bindings using
    WebAssembly (Wasm).

OPTIONS

 -api

     use Wasm -api => 0;

    As of this writing, since the API is subject to change, this must be
    provided and set to 0.

 -exporter

     use Wasm -api => 0, -exporter => 'all';
     use Wasm -api => 0, -exporter => 'ok';

    Configure the caller as an Exporter, with all the functions in the
    WebAssembly either @EXPORT (all) or @EXPORT_OK (ok).

 -file

     use Wasm -api => 0, -file => $file;

    Path to a WebAssembly file in either WebAssembly Text (.wat) or
    WebAssembly binary (.wasm) format.

 -imports

     use Wasm -api => 0, -imports => \@imports;

    Use the given imports when creating the module instance.

 -package

     use Wasm -api => 0, -package => $package;

    Install subroutines in to $package namespace instead of the calling
    namespace.

 -self

     use Wasm -api => 0, -self;

    Look for a WebAssembly Text (.wat) or WebAssembly binary (.wasm) file
    with the same base name as the Perl source this is called from.

    For example if you are calling this from lib/Foo/Bar.pm, it will look
    for lib/Foo/Bar.wat and lib/Foo/Bar.wasm. If both exist, then it will
    use the newer of the two.

 -wat

     use Wasm -api => 0, -wat => $wat;

    String containing WebAssembly Text (WAT). Helpful for inline
    WebAssembly inside your Perl source file.

SEE ALSO

    Wasm::Wasmtime

      Low level interface to wasmtime.

    Wasm::Hook

      Load WebAssembly modules as though they were Perl modules.
