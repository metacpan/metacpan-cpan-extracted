0.19 Thu Jan 31 16:38:15 PST 2008
	- Cleaned up the whole set__foo() and _foo() stuff.  I think.

0.18 Wed Jan 30 09:55:37 PST 2008
	- Took out the conflict resolution feature.  There was a problem
	caused by multiple inheritance that I don't have time to ponder
	right now.

	Removed uninitialized().

0.17 Mon Dec 31 11:55:17 PST 2007
	- Added conflict resolution for inherited attributes.  That means
	  you can do $obj->set_a(1) and it won't conflict with the derived
	  class doing a $self->set_a(2).

0.16 Mon Oct 29 14:06:05 PDT 2007
	- Added STORABLE_freeze() and STORABLE_thaw() to support Storable.
	  Doing that meant I removed DUMP and SLURP.  If anybody actually
	  uses those, let me know and I'll put them back in.

0.15 Wed Oct  3 16:33:04 PDT 2007

	  not installed.
