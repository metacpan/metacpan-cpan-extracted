0.9.11  2017-01-13 (PERLANCAR)

        - Introduce !none encoding.

        - [Experimental] Allow '~' first character of value to implicitly turn
          on !path encoding. This is to avoid a potentially common trap because
          a configuration often contains paths. To disable path encoding
          interpretation of '~foo', one can quote using double quote, e.g.
          "~foo" or use the newly introduced !none encoding.


0.9.10  2016-02-24 (PERLANCAR)

	- [Experimental] Introduce encodings !path and !paths which are
	  literal string/array of strings but with some
	  substitution/wildcard expansion.


0.9.9   2015-03-18 (PERLANCAR)

        - Be more strict about directive line: it must not be indented
          (otherwise it becomes a normal comment line).

        - Fix wordings and minor updates.


0.9.8   2015-01-03 (PERLANCAR)

	- No spec changes.

	- Rebuild (Generate TODO.md).


0.9.7    2014-09-18 (PERLANCAR)

         - No spec changes.

         - Wording and fix example for !merge.


0.9.6    2014-08-28 (PERLANCAR)

         - For convenience, allow value that starts with '[' and '{' to be
           interpreted as JSON (array and hash, respectively).


0.9.5    2014-08-18 (SHARYANTO)

         - Fix grammars and typos.

         - Officially allow bang-only directive ('!foo').


0.9.4    2014-08-18 (SHARYANTO)

         - No spec changes.

         - Tweak Abstract.

         - Fix typo.


0.9.3    2014-08-17 (SHARYANTO)

         - Add directive: !noop (does nothing, for testing).

         - To catch common errors of directive syntax, implementation is now
           encouraged to allow: '!noop' (bang only), '! noop', '; !noop', '; !
           noop' (whitespaces).


0.9.2    2014-08-17 (SHARYANTO)

         [REMOVED FEATURES]

         - Remove '!nomerge' directive. To stop merging, specify '!merge' with
           no arguments.


0.9.1    2014-08-13 (SHARYANTO)

         - Use JSON rule for double-quoted string (in key value as well as
           directive argument), this way we don't have to define our own string
           rule.

         - Introduce key value encoding. This is the more extensible way.
           Currently known encodings: !j (!json), !e (!expr), !base64, !h
           (!hex).

         - Remove !defaults directive, its function can be replaced by !merge.

         - Remove mode merging for now.

         - !merge can merge multiple sections.

         - Expression is left undefined for now, no longer defined as using the
           Xslate/Kolon syntax. Change syntax of expression to use value
           encoding.

         - Add TODO section.

         - Remove mention of nested section. Implementation is now left to do it
           (or not).

         - Remove encoding/quoting in section name and key name for now.

         - Remove !sectionpath and !nosectionpath for now.

         - Other tweaks.


0.9.0    2012-10-14 (SHARYANTO)

         - First release. Split from implementation Config-Ini-OnDrugs.

         - Some rewording and reorganization.

         - Change nested section syntax, from using indented section line to
           using [foo/bar], in an effort to prevent users getting confused with
           significant indentation.

         - Expression now uses Text::Xslate::Syntax::Kolon instead of
           Language::Expr (probably temporary? due to slow implementation of
           Language::Expr).

         - Add directives: !sectionpath, !no{merge,defaults,sectionpath}

         - Now only one argument is allowed for !defaults.

         - Some rewording and reorganization.
