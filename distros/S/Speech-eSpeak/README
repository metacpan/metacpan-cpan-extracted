Speech-eSpeak version 0.4
==========================

This is a Perl binding for eSpeak TTS.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

If ERROR occurs from the above operation, read below:

Make sure you have made symbolic links of eSpeak first. The release of eSpeak from SourceForge is a stand alone version. You should do the following command first:

#sudo ln -s /{path_to_espeak}/shared_library/libespeak.so.{version} /usr/lib/libespeak.so
#sudo ln -s /{path_to_espeak}/shared_library/libespeak.so.{version} /usr/lib/libespeak.so.1
#sudo ln -s /{path_to_espeak}/espeak-data /
#ln -s /{path_to_espeak}/espeak-data ~/
#sudo ln -s /{path_to_espeak}/espeak /usr/bin/

You should substitute {path_to_espeak} and {version} according to your situation.

If you are using a 64bit system, you may need to make a 64bit libespeak.so from source yourself. Here is an existed one from Ubuntu which I have never tried myself:
