2.005003 2025-04-13

* Add new methods to_fp80() and from_fp80() for encoding and decoding values in
  the x86 extended-precision 80 bit format.

2.005002 2025-03-28

* Fix the handling of read-only objects in bblsft() and bbrsft() in
  Math::BigFloat and Math::BigRat.

2.005001 2025-03-25

New:

* Add new method bperm() to Math::BigInt, Math::BigFloat, and Math::BigRat.

* Add the following methods to Math::BigRat and Math::BigFloat:

    bilog2(), bilog10(), bclog2(), bclog10(), bfib(), blucas(),
    from_bytes(), from_base(), to_bytes(), to_ieee754()

* Add method bmuladd(), bgcd(), and blcm() to Math::BigRat.

* Add method bpi() to Math::BigRat. It returns a rational approximation of PI
  accurate to the specified accuracy or precision, or the default accuracy if
  no accuracy is specified.

* Add methods bdstr(), bnstr(), and bestr() to Math::BigRat.

* Add support for rounding in Math::BigFloat methods bdstr(), bestr(), bnstr(),
  and bestr().

* Add method from_ieee754() to Math::BigInt and Math::BigRat, including
  documentation. In Math::BigInt, from_ieee754() is similar to the other
  from_xxx() methods in that way that it returns a NaN if the input is a finite
  non-integer.

* Add new backend library method _scmp() for doing signed comparison.

Changes/Improvements:

* Method new() now always returns a new object, as would be expected.

* Make bgcd() in Math::BigRat and Math::BigFloat support non-integer arguments.
  Now, bgcd(0.8, 1.2) in Math::BigFloat returns 0.4, and bgcd(4/5, 6/5) in
  Math::BigRat returns 2/5.

* Make blcm(0, 0) work the same way in Math::BigInt, Math::BigRat, and
  Math::BigFloat. Now blcm(0, 0) is always 0.

* Correct the documentation for is_inf(), bceil() and bfloor()

* Methods bdiv() and bmod() are now aliases to bfdiv() and bfmod(),
  respectively. (This doesn't change the behaviour of bdiv() and bmod().)

* Math::BigFloat methods bfmod() and btmod() are faster than before.

* Improve documentation for bnok().

* Improve upgrading and downgrading, e.g., use $class->upgrade() rather than
  just $upgrade, since the former works better for sublasses.

Fixes:

* Add missing calls to modify().

* All boolean methods now return 1 or 0. Some would return 1 or "".

* Harmonise methods in different classes so they behave similarly, at least to
  the extent possible.

* Fix bug in Math::BigInt->bfib() causing sign to be incorrect for some of the
  output values when bfib() was called in list context with a negative input.

* Correct miscellaneous typos and errors in the documentation.

2.004001 2025-02-12

* Improve upgrading and downgrading.

  - Upgrading and downgrading is more consistent.

  - Upgrading and downgrading now keeps the reference, so in the following
    example, $x changes from being a Math::BigInt with a value of 2 to a
    Math::BigFloat with the value 1.4142...

      perl -Mbignum -le '$x = 2; $x -> bsqrt(); print $x'

* Fix bug in Math::BigFloat->bdiv(): in list context, bdiv() would do floored
  division, except when the denominator was 1. Now, bdiv() always does floored
  division.

2.003004 2025-01-23

* Fix CPAN RT #150252 regarding bdiv() not modifying the invocand object when
  upgrading/downgrading is enabled.

* Add hyperoperator method bhyperop(). This method implements succession,
  addition, multiplication, exponentiation, tetration, pentation ...).

2.003003 2024-05-27

* Fix CPAN RT #153736 regarding bnok() with large input values.

2.003002 2024-01-05

 * Improved interaction between Math::BigInt and the backend libraries.

 * Much faster versions of _ilog2() and _clog2() implemented in the
   Math::BigInt::Calc backend library. This should speed up bilog2() and
   bclog2() in Math::BigInt when "Calc" is used as the backend liberary.

2.003001 2023-12-26

 * Add configuration methods trap_inf() and trap_nan(). Previously it was only
   possible to modify these properties by using the config() method.

 * Fix CPAN RT #150796 so that config() no longer modifies the input when it is
   a hash ref.

 * Fix CPAN RT #150797 so that both accuracy and precision can be set
   simultaneously with config().

 * Add the following methods to Math::BigInt

   - bilog2()   base 2 logarithm rounded downwards, i.e., int(log2(x))
   - bilog10()  base 10 logarithm rounded downwards, i.e., int(log10(x))
   - bclog2()   base 2 logarithm rounded upwards, i.e., ceil(log2(x))
   - bclog10()  base 10 logarithm rounded upwards, i.e., ceil(log10(x))

 * Add the following backend library methods to Math::BigInt::Lib. These
   methods do the core computations for the corresponding methods in
   Math::BigInt (see above).

   - _ilog2()   base 2 logarithm rounded downwards
   - _ilog10()  base 10 logarithm rounded downwards
   - _clog2()   base 2 logarithm rounded upwards
   - _clog10()  base 10 logarithm rounded upwards

2.002001 2023-12-09

 * Fix CPAN RT #150523

2.002000 2023-12-02

 * Fix bug in Math::BigFloat method bsin(). It can now handle any argument to
   any precision. Also improve downgrading. This fixes CPAN RT #150590 and the
   bsin() part of CPAN RT #107604.

 * Fix bug in Math::BigFloat method bexp(). Specifying precision (rather than
   accuracy) used to give a NaN. Also improve downgrading.

 * Improve upgrading in Math::BigInt methods bsin() and bcos(). They now
   upgrade only when necessary.

2.001001 2023-11-21

 * Fix CPAN RT #150469

2.001000 2023-11-13

 * Fix rounding bug in bsqrt() in Math::BigInt. Also make bsqrt() upgrade only
   when necessary.

 * Simplify and speed up bsqrt() (for computing the square root) in
   Math::BigFloat. The computation time now mainly depends on the desired
   accuracy, not the number of digits in the significand.

 * Add support for using "div_scale" as import parameter, like this

       use Math::BigFloat div_scale => 80;

 * Add better argument checking when the "div_scale" value is set by the
   user.

2.000000 2023-10-29

 * Merge the Math-BigRat distribution into the Math-BigInt distribution. This
   merge eliminates the problems that users have experienced when incompatible
   versions of the two distributions have been installed. This fixes CPAN RT
   #143228.

 * Add method from_dec() to Math::BigRat to make Math::BigRat more consistent
   with Math::BigInt and Math::BigFloat.

* To be consistent with Math::BigInt and Math::BigFloat, make it possible to
  use "require" with Math::BigRat, e.g.,

       require Math::BigRat;
       $x = Math::BigRat -> bone();

 * Fix cases where "require" doesn't work for Math::BigInt and Math::BigFloat,
   and add tests to verify that "require" works for Math::BigInt, Math::BigRat,
   and Math::BigFloat.

 * Add methods bblsft() and bbrsft() to Math::BigRat to make Math::BigRat
   consistent with Math::BigInt and Math::BigFloat. These methods do bitwise
   left and right shift, respectively.

 * Fix bug in to_oct() and to_bin() in Math::BigFloat. They called to_hex()
   when upgrading, but should have called to_oct() and to_bin(), respectively.

 * Add to_hex(), to_oct(), to_bin() to Math::BigRat.

 * Add new method binv() to Math::BigInt, Math::BigFloat, and Math::BigRat.

 * Improve as_float() and as_rat().

 * POD updates.

1.999842 2023-09-27

 * Fix a bug causing Math::BigInt and Math::BigFloat to be caught in an endless
   recursion. The bug was introduced when trying to fix
   https://github.com/pjacklam/p5-Math-BigInt/issues/8

 * Allow div_scale to be 0. It is not documented what div_scale <= 0 means, but
   there are modules that set div_scale to 0 (e.g., Astro::Units) and fail
   their tests if this is not supported.

1.999841 2023-09-21

 * Remove development files that were accidentally included in the
   distribution.

1.999840 2023-09-18

 * Add methods bblsft() and bbrsft(), which do bitwise left and right shift,
   respectively. The binary operators for bitwise left and right shift, "<<"
   and ">>", now call the methods bblsft() and bbrsft(), respectively.

   While this behaviour is consistent with how "<<" and ">>" work on floating
   point numbers in core Perl, it changes how "<<" and ">>" worked on
   Math::BigFloat objects. This is a corner case, but any code currently using
   "<<" and ">>" on Math::BigFloat objects might need to be modified as follows

       $x >>= $y    should be changed to    $x -> brsft($y)
       $x <<= $y    should be changed to    $x -> blsft($y)
       $x >>  $y    should be changed to    $x -> copy() -> brsft($y)
       $x <<  $y    should be changed to    $x -> copy() -> blsft($y)

 * Improve blsft() and brsft(). They now support negative shift values, an
   arbitrarily large base, and have better handling of cases involving NaN.

1.999839 2023-07-14

 * Update documentation. Remove/update obsolete URLs.

 * Fix CPAN RT #148953 regarding loss of precision when using "log" in
   "bignum". The issue was related to broken upgrading and downgrading in
   Math::BigFloat.

1.999838 2023-03-30

 * Fix CPAN RT #146411 regarding infinite recursion in bitwise operations. This
   happened when arguments were upgraded and downgraded and upgraded again ad
   infinitum. Add tests to verify the fix.

1.999837 2022-07-02

 * Improve the interoperability between objects of different classes for the
   methods that are still used as functions.

1.999836 2022-06-24

 * Improve compatibility with older versions of the Math-BigRat distribution.
   Math-BigInt version 1.999835 works with Math-BigRat version 0.2623 and newer.
   Math-BigInt version 1.999836 works with Math-BigRat version 0.2618 and newer.

 * Re-enable upgrading in Math::BigFloat->bdiv().

 * Fix an error in the enabling/disabling of upgrading/downgrading.

 * Fix typos and other formatting errors.

1.999835 2022-05-24

 * Fix bug related to upgrading in Math::BigInt->brsft(). This bug
   only showed up in Perl versions 5.16 and older.

1.999834 2022-05-23

 * Further improvements to upgrading and downgrading.

1.999833 2022-05-23

 * Fix Math::BigFloat->bpi(). The previous attempt at correcting it
   wasn't sufficient. Added test to verify the fix.

 * Correct the formatting in the CHANGES file.

1.999832 2022-05-21

 * Improve as_int(), as_float(), and as_rat() so that they return a
   Math::BigInt, Math::BigFloat, and Math::BigRat, respectivly,
   regardless of upgrading and downgrading.

 * Improve stringification method bsstr() so that it handles upgrading
   and downgrading better.

 * Fix Math::BigFloat->bpi(), which unfortunately didn't handle
   downgrading.

 * Avoid unnecessary downgrading/upgrading.

 * Add missed cases where downgrading/upgrading should be performed.

 * Avoid unnecessary stringification.

1.999831 2022-05-16

 * Further improvements to upgrading, downgrading, and rounding.

 * New stringification method bfstr() for representing numbers as fractions.
   E.g., Math::BigFloat -> new("1.25") -> bfstr() returns "5/4".

 * Miscellaneous bug fixes.

 * Fixed errors and typos in the documentation.

1.999830 2022-04-11

 * Improve upgrading and downgrading. This work is not complete. Some methods
   still don't downgrade when they should.

1.999829 2021-12-29

 * Improve methods div_scale() and round_mode() so they work better with
   subclasses. This fixes CPAN RT #125430.

 * Make div_scale() accept a Math::Big(Int|Float|Rat) object as input. This
   fixes CPAN RT #140599.

1.999828 2021-12-17

 * Add new methods numerator(), denominator(), and fparts().

 * Fix bug in to_ieee754(). Avoid that the significand overflows.

 * Improve bpow(). Avoid unnecessary upgrading.

 * Fix typos and improve wording.

1.999827 2021-10-03

 * Improve error message for missing library argument.

 * Skip tests that don't work on older Perls. Also skip tests that compare
   floating point numbers.

1.999826 2021-10-01

 * Improve documentation related to floating point literals.

 * Skip tests that fail due to Perl's broken handling of floating point literals
   before v5.32.0.

1.999825 2021-09-28

 * Make Math::BigInt accept integers regardless of whether they are written as
   decimal, binary, octal, or hexadecimal integers or decimal, binary, octal, or
   hexadecimal floating point number.

 * When numeric constants are overloaded (with the ":constant" option) in
   Math::BigInt, every numeric constant that represent an integer is converted
   to an object regardless of how it is written. All finite non-integers are
   converted to a NaN.

 * When numeric constants are overloaded (with the ":constant" option) in
   Math::BigFloat, every numeric constant is converted to an object regardless
   of how it is written.

 * Add method from_dec() (cf. from_bin(), from_oct(), and from_hex()). It is
   like new() except that it does not accept anything but a string representing a
   finite decimal number.

1.999824 2021-09-20

 * Don't allow mixing math libraries. Use the first backend math library that is
   successfully loaded, and ignore any further attempts at loading a different
   backend library. This is a solution to the re-occurring problem of using
   objects using different math libraries.

 * Add missing documentation.

 * Miscellaneous minor improvements.

1.999823 2021-07-12

 * Improve the handling of the backend libraries. Provide more useful warnings
   and error messages. Update the documentation.

1.999822 2021-07-09

 * Make the from_hex(), from_oct(), and from_bin() methods consistent with
   CORE::oct(), which does not require a leading "0" before the letter ("x",
   "o", or "b").

 * Make the from_oct() and new() methods accept octal numbers with prefix
   "0o", "0O", "o" (lowercase letter o), and "O" (capital letter O).

 * Make the from_bin() and new() methods accept binary numbers with
   prefix "0b", "0B", "b", and "B".

 * Make the from_hex() and new() methods accept hexadecimal numbers with
   prefix "0x", "0X", "x", and "X".

 * Update test files to match with the above.

1.999821 2021-07-06

 * Make new() and from_hex() accept the "0X" prefix, not just the "0x" prefix,
   but not accept just "X" or "x". Now, "0XFF" returns 255, not NaN.

 * Make new() and from_bin() accept the "0B" prefix, not just the "0b" prefix, but
   not accept just "B" or "b". Now, "0B1111" returns 255, not NaN.

 * Make new() and from_oct() accept the "0o" and "0O" prefixes, but not accept
   just "O" (capital letter O) or "o" (lowercase letter o). Now, "0o377" and
   "0O377" return 255, not NaN. Also intepret floating point numbers with a
   leading zero and a binary exponent as an octal number, so that "01.4p0"
   returns 1.5, not NaN. There is still no ambiguety, since decimal floating
   point numbers use "e" or "E" before the exponent, and binary and hexadecimal
   floating point numbers use a "0b"/"0B" or "0x"/"0x" prefix, respectively.

1.999820 2021-07-06

 * Fix bug and improve error messages in Math::BigInt::import().

1.999819 2021-07-02

 * Add method btfac() (triple factorial) and bmfac() (multi-factorial),
   including tests and documentation.

 * Add missing and correct erroneous documentation for bfac() (factorial)
   and bdfac() (double factorial). Also correct handling of special cases
   and add tests for these cases.

 * Fix error in bsin() and bcos() causing them to hang indefinitely if the
   invocand is +/-inf.

 * Make it possible for the end user to specify the base length used internally
   in Math::BigInt::Calc.

1.999818 2019-10-20

 * Fix CPAN RT #130736 regarding numify() on a Math::BigFloat with a large
   number of digits and an equally large, but negative, exponent.

 * Fix a problem in to_ieee754() due to rounding in bpow().

1.999817 2019-10-11

 * Avoid non-integers in intermediate computations in Math::BigInt::Calc. This
   causes errors due to rounding issues, e.g., 47265625999999999 / 1000000000
   is 47265626 with double precision.

 * Remove api_version() and the corresponding test file. There is no need to
   check which methods are supported by a backend library now that each backend
   library is a subclass of Math::BigInt::Lib. Methods not provided in the
   backend library are provided by the parent class.

 * Add to_ieee745() and from_ieee754().

 * Add backermann() and ackermann() for the Ackermann function.

 * Add buparrow() and uparrow() for Knuth's up-arrow notation.

 * Add information about the github repository.

 * Update links in SUPPORT section in POD.

 * Fix bpow(). It returned NaN when it should truncate to zero.

 * Make blsft() in Math::BigInt allow bases up until the largest unsigned
   integer.

 * Make _lsft() in Math::BigInt::Calc handle an arbitrarily large base.

 * Add new methods bdigitsum() and digitsum() to Math::BigInt. Add new method
   _digitsum() to Math::BigInt::Lib.

 * Add new methods is_non_negative() and is_non_positive().

 * Extend the default collation sequence used by to_base() and from_base() to
   all the 94 printable ASCII characters except blank/space.

 * Make new() in Math::BigFloat handle octal floating point numbers.

 * Slightly more robust t/01load.t.

 * Remove unused variables.

 * Miscellaneous code cleanup.

1.999816 2018-10-26

 * bnok() for Math::BigInt and Math::BigFloat now support the full Kronenburg
   extension. The behaviour is identical to the behaviour of the Maple and
   Mathematica function for negative integers n, k. Add tests. This closes CPAN
   RT #95628.

 * Fix POD errors. This closes CPAN RT #125141.

1.999815 2018-10-19

 * Move bitwise operators signed and, signed or, and signed xor from
   lib/Math/BigInt/CalcEmu.pm into lib/Math/BigInt/Lib.pm. The file
   lib/Math/BigInt/CalcEmu.pm is no longer needed and thus removed.

1.999814 2018-10-01

 * Add to_base() and from_base() to Math::BigInt and corresponding library
   methods _to_base() and _from_base() to Math::BigInt::Lib. This was inspired
   by CPAN RT #122681.

 * Fix Makefile.PL to reflect that Test::More is only needed for testing, not
   for building.

 * In the documentation for each of the to_(bin|hex|oct|bytes) methods, add a
   reference to the corresponding from_(bin|hex|oct|bytes) method.

1.999813 2018-04-18

 * Fix CPAN RT #125108. Remove test files try.pl, t/author-bpi-big-mbf.t, and
   t/release-unused-vars.t, which were included in the 1.999812 distribution by
   accident.

1.999812 2018-04-17

 * Fix CPAN RT #120351 regarding bpow(). Add test.

 * Fix CPAN RT #120717 regarding tests now that '.' is not in @INC by default.

 * Fix CPAN RT #122756 regarding testing for 64 bit integer support.

 * Fix case when both accuracy and precision are set, resulting in a NaN. This
   closes CPAN RT #124790.

 * Fix typo in one of the change log entries for version 1.999811.

 * Clearify documentation of rounding modes.

 * Update the documentation of configuration parameters.

 * Fix rounding and accuracy in bpi(). Extra digits in intermediate computation
   were not used, causing the last digits to be inaccurate. In addition, the
   rounding was incorrect in some cases.

 * Use config() as a method, rather than a function. Also use config("xyz")
   rather than config()->{xyz}.

 * Correct more of the problems with rounding in the constructors. If rounding
   arguments are given as arguments to the constructor, the constructor should
   assign those values to the instance. If no rounding arguments are given, and
   the constructor is called as a class method, the class rounding variables
   should be assigned to the instance. Added test file
   t/author-constructors-a-p-r.t to replace t/author-constructors-a-p.t, but
   lots of tests are failing and (for now) commented out.

 * Remove statements used for debugging.

 * Fix typos.

 * Cleaner log/exp-related code in Math::BigFloat.

 * Remove unused variables.

 * Add test file t/release-portability.t.

 * Add test file t/release-whitespaces.t.

 * Convert test file t/02pod.t to t/release-pod.t and t/03podcov.t to
   t/release-pod-coverage.t.

 * Reformat CHANGES to match the specification in CPAN::Changes::Spec and
   CPAN::Meta::Spec.

 * Expand tabs to spaces and clean up whitepace.

 * Include tests that were previously commented out.

 * Use $LIB as the variable name for backend math library.

 * Import "carp" and "croak" from the Carp module.

 * Math::BigInt isa Exporter, so Math::BigInt should require Exporter.
   Math::BigFloat has Math::BigInt in @ISA, so it doesn't need to require
   Exporter.

 * Don't load Test::More when it isn't really needed. This speeds up processing
   of author test files when they are skipped.

1.999811 2017-03-15 pjacklam

 * Fix an old bug in the Math::BigFloat methods as_hex(), as_oct(), and
   as_bin() methods resulting in loss of accuracy. This bug was introduced in
   bug in Math-BigInt-1.76. Due to a naive copy and paste by me, and lack of
   tests, this bug was also present in the newer to_hex(), to_oct(), and
   to_bin() methods. This shows the bug, as it did not print "0xffff...":

       print Math::BigFloat -> from_hex("f" x 30) -> as_hex();

 * Fix incorrect formatting in the output from the Math::BigFloat methods
   to_hex(), to_oct(), and to_bin() when the output was zero. A prefix was
   added when it shouldn't have been.

 * Add tests to bigintpm.inc and bigfltpm.inc for better testing of as_hex(),
   as_oct(), and as_bin() as well as to_hex(), to_oct(), and to_bin().

 * "Synchronize" tests and code formatting in bigintpm.inc and bigfltpm.inc.

1.999810 2017-03-01 pjacklam

 * CPAN RT #120240 revealed that the problems with undefined values is still
   present. After a close examination, I believe the only way to get this
   really working is to to make blog() call objectify() differently depending
   on whether the base for the logarithm is undefined or not. That way we can
   avoid objectify() converting the undefined value to a zero. Ideally, we
   should warn about undefined values when used in any other context, but we'll
   handle that in a later release. See also the related changelog entry for
   v1.999801.

 * Fix the way the argument count is computed in objectify(). When an argument
   count of 0 is given, it means that we should objectify all input arguments.
   However, it turned out that the actual argument count was computed
   incorrectly.

 * Fix CPAN RT #120242 rearding c3 method resolution.

1.999809 2017-02-10 pjacklam

 * When a new method is added to Math::BigInt or Math::BigFloat, and this new
   method requires a new backend library method, die with a suitable error
   message if the installed backend library does not support this new method.
   The error message says that the method requires a newer version of the
   backend library.

 * Fix typos in Math::BigFloat and Math::BigInt.

 * Add bfib() and blucas() to Math::BigInt. They return Fibonacci and Lucas
   numbers, respectively. The actual computation of the numbers is done by the
   backend library. Documented both methods in POD. Add test files bfib-mbi.t
   and blucas-mbi.t.

 * Add _fib() and _lucas() to Math::BigInt::Lib. They return Fibonacci and
   Lucas numbers, respectively. Document both methods in POD. Add test files
   author-lib-arithmetic-unary-_fib.t and author-lib-arithmetic-unary-_lucas.t.

1.999808 2017-01-11 pjacklam

 * In Math::BigInt and Math::BigFloat, add methods bdfac() for double
   factorial. Add tests for this method.

 * In Math::BigInt and Math::BigFloat, add methods to_hex(), to_oct(), and
   to_bin() for hexadecimal, octal, and binary string output without prefix.
   Even for Math::BigFloat there is still only support for integer output. Add
   tests for these methods.

 * Add test for as_oct() corresponding to the old tests for as_hex() and
   as_bin().

 * In Math::BigInt::Lib, add method _dfac() for double factorial. Add
   corresponding tests.

 * In Math::BigInt::Lib, fix bug in overloaded "int".

 * In Math::BigInt::Lib, implement much faster versions of _from_hex(),
   _from_oct(), and _from_bin().

 * In Makefile.PL, improve the wording in the message displayed if some of
   the installed backend libraries are not a subclass of Math::BigInt::Lib (and
   hence will not provide

 * Fix minor bugs in some of the author library test files (t/author-lib*.t).

 * Allow leading and trailing whitespace in the input to from_hex(),
   from_oct(), and from_bin().  Add tests to verify. This is a regressions
   (CPAN RT #119805).

1.999807 2016-12-23 pjacklam

 * Add a message to Makefile.PL recommending upgrade if old libraries are
   installed. This message is more or less equivalent to the one appearing in
   Math-BigInt up until v1.997.

 * Improve the documentation (POD) in Math::BigInt::Lib.

 * Speed up _sqrt() and _root() in Math::BigInt::Lib.

 * Remove checking for exception cases (cases that would return +Inf, -Inf, or
   NaN) in Math::BigInt::Lib. It has been documented for a long time that such
   checking should be done by the caller.

 * Add library methods _to_bin(), _to_oct(), _to_hex(), which are equivalent to
   the _as_bin(), _as_oct(), and _as_hex() methods respectively, except that
   the _to_*() methods don't use a prefix in the output. This removes the need
   for the frequent removal of the various prefixes. Now each _as_*() method
   calls the equivalent _to_*() method, adds a prefix, and returns the output.
   The _to_*() methods are faster than the equivalent _as_*() methods were.

 * Add author test files for the methods _to_bin(), _to_oct(), and _to_hex().

 * Add library method _to_bytes(). The method _as_bytes() would have been
   called _to_bytes() if I had thought of it earlier. The method _as_bytes() is
   now just an alias to _to_bytes(). The _to_bytes() method also fixes a bug
   that was present in the _as_bytes() method. (CPAN RT #119346).

 * Add author test files for the method _to_bytes().

 * Add more tests for library methods _inc() and _dec(). When trying to bring
   the Math::BigInt::BitVect library back to life I realized that the test
   suite didn't catch certain errors in _inc() and _dec().

 * Die if trying to use as_bytes() or from_bytes() with a backend library that
   doesn't support the corresponding library methods.

 * Correct minor errors in the output messages in the test files.

 * Improve/correct various comments in the source code.

 * More diagnostic output is displayed by the author test files if the
   AUTHOR_DEBUGGING environment variable is set.

1.999806 2016-12-13 pjacklam

 * Add more logic to Makefile.PL regarding INSTALLDIRS (CPAN RT #119199
   and #119225).

 * In the TODO file, remove stuff that has been implemented.

1.999805 2016-12-11 pjacklam

 * Fix Makefile.PL so that this module installs over the core version.

 * Add more tests for _nok() (binomial coefficient "n over k"). These new tests
   revealed some problems with some of the backend libraries when _nok() was
   given very large arguments.

 * Remove t/Math/BigFloat/#Subclass.pm#, which is an Emacs temporary file
   included by accident.

1.999804 2016-12-07 pjacklam

 * Implement as_bytes(), as requested (CPAN RT 119096). Also implement the
   inverse conversion from_bytes(). This applies to Math::BigInt only. (Alas,
   these methods will be inherited from Math::BigInt into Math::BigFloat,
   Math::BigRat etc. where the methods won't work. Fixing this class
   relationship is an issue of its own.)

 * Implement _as_bytes() and _from_bytes() in Math::BigInt::Lib. Preferably,
   the various backend libraries will implement faster versions of their
   own. Add author test files for testing these methods thorougly.

 * Fix from_hex(), from_oct(), and from_bin().
   - When called as instance methods, the new value should be assigned to the
     invocand unless the invocand is read-only (a constant).
   - When called as instance methods, the assigned value was incorrect, if the
     invocand was inf or NaN.
   - Add tests to t/from_hex-mbf.t, t/from_oct-mbf.t, and t/from_bin-mbf.t
     to confirm the fix.
   - Add new test files t/from_hex-mbi.t, t/from_oct-mbi.t, and
     t/from_bin-mbi.t for better testing of these methods with Math::BigInt.

 * Correct typo in Math/BigInt/Lib.pm (otherise -> otherwise) (CPAN RT 118829).

 * Add POD coverage testing of Math::BigInt::Lib to t/03podcov.t.

1.999803 2016-12-03 pjacklam

 * Remove BENCHMARK file. The information was obsolete.

 * Use ExtUtils::MakeMaker rather than Module::Install in Makefile.PL

 * Reorder CHANGES file (this file) so the newest entries appear at the top.

 * Fix error in test information text in various author test files.

 * Remove author information in LICENSE file.

 * Inform that the TODO file is not up to date.

1.999802 2016-11-28 pjacklam

 * When bzero(), bone(), binf(), and bnan() are used as constructors, don't
   check whether the class allows the object to be modified. A constructor
   isn't modifying any existing object. This applies to both Math::BigInt and
   Math::BigFloat.

 * Improve bgcd() and blcm(). This applies to both Math::BigInt and
   Math::BigFloat.

1.999801 2016-11-23 pjacklam

 * Fix, hopefully once and for all, the longstanding problem of handling undef
   as an operand to mathematical methods. The only method that accepts undef as
   an operand is blog(), where the second operand might be undef, as in
   $x->blog() or $x->blog($b), where $b is undef. The undef signifies that
   Euler's number should be used as the base. With this fix, we should be able
   to get Math::BigInt::Lite working again.

 * Add least common multiple method _lcm() to Math::BigInt::Lib, and add
   corresponding test file t/author-lib-arithmetic-binary-_lcm.t and test data
   file t/author-lib-arithmetic-binary-_lcm.dat.

 * Remove internal function __lcm() which has become redundant now that _lcm()
   is in the library.

 * Make it possible to use bgcd() and blcm() as class methods, since other
   methods can be used as class methods. This applies to both Math::BigInt and
   Math::BigFloat.

 * Fix blcm() with negative input. The LCM should always be non-negative. This
   applies to both Math::BigInt and Math::BigFloat.

 * Add tests for bgcd() and blcm() in t/bigintpm.t and t/bigfltpm.t.

 * Fix tests for blcm() assuming that LCM(0,0) should be a NaN. LCM(0,0) is 0
   by convention.

 * Prefer Class->config('option') over Class->config()->{option}. However, this
   does not seem to be working for all options. It seems that this won't work
   properly until we move the global variables into the OO interface.

 * Explicitly specify the library in all test files that are shared between
   Math-BigInt and the library distributions (FaatCalc, GMP, Pari, ...) with,
   e.g., "use Math::BigInt only => 'Calc';". This way, it will fail immediately
   if the specified library can't be loaded rather than using the fallback
   library.

1.999800 2016-11-15 pjacklam

 * Upgrade bundled Module::Install from version 1.16 to version 1.17.

 * Add Math::BigInt::Lib (lib/Math/BigInt/Lib.pm), a parent class for
   Math::BigInt backend libraries.

 * Use objects in Math::BigInt::Calc, not just array refs. Also use OO-style,
   i.e., use $class->_add($x, $y) rather than _add($class, $x, $y).

 * Not all library methods modify the invocand, so call library methods as,
   e.g, $x = $LIB->method($x, $y) rather than just $LIB->method($x, $y).

 * Math::BigInt::Calc is now a subclass of Math::BigInt::Lib.

 * Add Math::BigInt::Lib::Minimal (t/Math/BigInt/Lib/Minimal.pm) for testing
   inheritance from Math::BigInt::Lib.

 * Minor simplification in Math::BigInt::Calc->_str().

 * Speed up Math::BigInt::Calc->_root().

 * Remove test files that were included in the previous release by accident.

 * Add more tests and use more verbose output in some tests.

 * Fix typo in lib/Math/BigFloat.pm

 * Fix documentation error in lib/Math/Calc.pm

 * Use Config::Tiny and an .ini file to handle the library specific
   configuration for the author-lib*.t test files.

1.999727 2016-11-04 pjacklam

 * Skip test exceeding the range of VAX floating point number in t/bigintpm.inc
   (CPAN RT 118468).

 * Fix typo in lib/Math/BigInt.pm (CPAN RT 118550).

1.999726 2016-07-15 pjacklam

 * Re-insert Math::BigFloat->DESTROY, which was accidentally removed in
   v1.999725.

1.999725 2016-07-13 pjacklam

Changes:

 * Add method is_finite().

 * In Math::BigInt and Math::BigFloat, remove warnings about deprecated usage,
   at least until we have removed this usage from the "bignum" distribution.
   These warnings were too annoying for some people.

Improvements:

 * Faster bnok() when the library (backend) does not support it.

 * In the Math::BigFloat method bpi(), use a precomputed list of digits when
   the accuracy is <= 1000. This speeds up the trigonometric functions
   considerably, when I will introduce range reduction in a later release. This
   makes the _atan_inv() method redundant, so remove it. Also, the _alen()
   library method is now only used in _log_int(), which is good, because it
   isn't clear from the docs and tests what it was supposed to do.

Fixes:

 * Fix bug in the Math::BigInt::Calc library method _digit(). It would
   sometimes return undef or an empty string when it should have returned zero.

 * Fix bug in the Math::BigInt::Calc library method _rsft(). It would sometimes
   return two output arguments.

 * Fix bug in the Math::BigInt::Calc library method _lsft(). When the number
   zero was shifted N places in base 10, the result was not zero, but an
   invalid object.

 * Fix bug in the Math::BigInt::Calc library methods _and(), _or(), and _xor().
   They always assigned zero to the first input argument (the invocand).

 * Improve the Math::BigInt::Calc library method _log_int() for the cases when
   the output is zero or one. Also simplify the code.

 * Simplify the code for the Math::BigInt::Calc library method _zeros().

 * Reformat Math::BigInt::Calc so it is easier to read, for me anyway.

 * Add file t/author-bnok-mbi.t

 * Add one test file for every method in the libraries, including
   t/Math/BigInt/Lib/TestUtil.pm with test utilities.

 * Clean up whitespace in all files in the distribution.

 * Better testing in t/author-bpi-mbf.t

 * The Math::BigInt::Calc library now always uses integers inside the objects,
   so there is no longer any need for all the "0 + ..." to convert strings to
   numbers, and the "int()" inside "length(int(...))" to determine the length
   of an array element. The only case that needs "0 + ..." now is the
   constructor _new(), whose input is a string.

   Note, however, that the Math::BigInt::FastCalc library method _new() still
   creates objects with leading zeros, so until that is fixed, we can't remove
   all the "0 + ..." etc. until Math::BigInt::FastCalc has been modified.

1.999724 2016-06-19 pjacklam

 * In Math/BigInt.pm and Math/BigFloat.pm, correct and improve to the
   documentation, e.g., reorder the methods so that methods that belogin
   together are grouped together.

 * In Math/BigInt.pm and Math/BigFloat.pm, refactor the code so that methods
   that belong together are grouped together. Also use consistent code
   formatting.

 * In Math/BigInt/Calc.pm, reformat the code.

1.999723 2016-06-09 pjacklam

 * Add Math::BigInt and Math::BigFloat methods bnstr(), bestr(), and bdstr(),
   as well as corresponding methods nparts(), eparts(), and dparts(). Also add
   test files bdstr-mbf.t, bdstr-mbi.t, bestr-mbf.t, bestr-mbi.t, bnstr-mbf.t,
   bnstr-mbi.t, bsstr-mbf.t, bsstr-mbi.t, dparts-mbf.t, dparts-mbi.t,
   eparts-mbf.t, eparts-mbi.t, nparts-mbf.t, nparts-mbi.t, sparts-mbf.t, and
   sparts-mbi.t.

 * Fix documentation errors.

1.999722 2016-04-26 pjacklam

 * Fix bug in bone() and binf() when used as a function. The error caused
   warnings about using an unitialized variable. This fix applies to both
   Math::BigInt and Math::BigFloat.

1.999721 2016-04-26 pjacklam

 * Prevent Math::BigFloat methods band(), bior(), bxor(), and bnot() from
   modifying unmodifiable objects.

1.999720 2016-04-26 pjacklam

 * Overloaded 'int' should not modify it's argument.

 * Better documentation of blsft() and brsft().

1.999719 2016-04-25 pjacklam

 * Revert the change to Math::BigFloat's blsft() and brsft() methods, which
   truncated the input (and output) to integers. However, now convert the base
   to an object only when the base isn't an object already. Also return NaN if
   any of the three operands is a NaN.

 * Change t/bigfltpm.inc to reflect the changes to blsft() and brsft(). Also,
   when a method should be tested, actually test that method, not the
   overloaded operator, which doesn't necessarily behave in the exact same
   manner as the method. This applies to the methods binc(), bdec(), bpow(),
   badd(), bsub(), bmul(), bdiv() in scalar context, brsft(), blsft(), and
   bmod().

 * The first output argument from objectify() is the class name, so use the
   variable name $class, not $self.

1.999718 2016-04-22 pjacklam

 * Improve documentation on large, unquoted input values to Math::BigInt.

 * Remove stuff from bitfltpm.inc that was placed into author-numify-mbf.t, but
   accidentally still present in bitfltpm.inc. Adjusted test counts as needed.

 * Fix file headers in author-bmod-bdiv-mbi.t and author-btmod-btdiv-mbi.t.

 * Add bnan(), binf(), and bsub() methods to Math::BigFloat. This is a step
   along the way to having Math::BigFloat no longer being a subclass of
   Math::BigInt.

 * Using bnan, binf(), bzero() and bone() as functions is deprecated. This is a
   step along the way to a pure object oriented design.

 * When bnan() and binf() are used as instance methods, they no longer delete
   the accuracy and precision instance variables.

 * Add test files from_bin-mbf.t, from_oct-mbf.t, and new-mbf.t.

 * Remove some code for Perl prior to 5.6. Such old versions are no longer
   support anyway.

 * Fix buggy handling of NaN in bcmp().

 * Add methods beq(), bne(), blt(), ble(), bgt(), and bge() to Math::BigInt and
   Math::BigFloat. These methods are called for the overloaded operators.

 * Add overloading of '==', '!=', '<', '<=', '>', to to Math::BigInt and
   Math::BigFloat and fix the broken overloading of '>='. These overloaded
   operators now behave like the equivalent core Perl operators.

 * Add test file author-relop-mbi-mbf.t for testing bcmp(), beq(), bne(),
   blt(), ble(), bgt(), and bge(), as well as the overloaded operators '==',
   '!=', '<', '<=', '>', and '>='.

 * 'int' now truncates a Math::BigFloat object to an integer without converting
   it to a Math::BigInt. When an object becomes a Math::BigInt, further
   computations with that object as invocand causes the arguments to be
   converted to Math::BigInt objects too, leading to unexpected results. This
   is confusing people. Unless downgrading is in effect, no Math::BigFloat
   object should become a Math::BigInt unless a Math::BigInt is explicitly
   requested.

 * For Math::BigFloat, modify bitwise operations brsft() and brsft(), and add
   band(), bior(), bxor(), and bnot(). These now handle floating point numbers
   the same way as core Perl does, i.e., truncate non-integers to integers
   before applying the bitwise operator. This change will also make Perl's
   behaviour more consistent whether 'use bignum' is in effect or not.

 * Add overloading of '~' (bitwise not). It just calls bnot(), which has been
   implemented for ages.

 * Fix error in POD for bone().

 * Take parts of the code in t/calling.t and move it into the new files
   t/calling-class-methods.t and t/calling-instance-methods.t.

 * Improve test descriptions in t/mbimbf.inc.

1.999717 2016-04-16 pjacklam

 * Using new() with an undefined argument no longer gives a warning. Explicit
   use of this is discouraged, but it is sometimes used by the modules
   themselves issuing warnings that is confusing to the end user. Just
   uncomment the code, since we plan to reintroduce this warning later.

 * Avoid using L<> around e-mail addressess in POD.

1.999716 2016-04-03 pjacklam

 * $x->new(...) can no longer be used to assign a value to $x. This was a
   mistake introduced in v1.999712. As the name "new" implies, it should always
   return a new object.

 * Using new() with no argument no longer gives a warning. This use has been
   discouraged, in favour of bzero(), for many years, but people are still
   using it, so I am reintroducing the support for this.

 * Added btdiv() and btmod() for truncated division (T-division) and ditto
   remainder. Add tests.

 * Add test files author-bmod-bdiv-mbi.t author-btmod-btdiv-mbi.t with more
   thorough testing of bdiv(), bmod(), btdiv(), and btmod().

 * When new() is used as an instance method, the new object is initialized as a
   copy of the invocand.

 * Move test for numfiy() of +Inf, -Inf, NaN, and big integers from
   bigfltpm.inc and bigintpm.inc into author-numify-mbi.t and
   author-numify-mbf.t.

 * Improved wording and fixed typos in earlier changelog entries.

1.999715 2016-01-05 pjacklam

 * Fix Math::BigFloat->bexp() based on patch by DANAJ (Dana Jacobsen).

 * Add Math::BigFloat->bexp() tests to "t/biglog.t" and new file
   "t/author-bexp-mbf.t".

 * Fix flawed test in test_bpow. It used ok($x, $y) rather than is($x, $y).

 * Add better descriptions (test names) to a few tests.

 * Wrap long line in the CHANGES file.

1.999714 2016-01-03 pjacklam

 * Add code to speed up Math::BigFloat->batan(). Thanks to DANAJ (Dana
   Jacobsen) for the patch.

 * Re-write Math::BigFloat->batan2() completely, except for the parts related
   to the rounding. The old version was sometimes correct, sometimes off by pi,
   and sometimes very inaccurate. Also add more tests.

 * Make it clearer in Math::BigFloat->bpi() when it is called as a method vs.
   as a function.

 * The Math::BigFloat->bpi() method can now be used as an instance method to
   assign pi to $x, as in $x->bpi().

 * Add tests for as_oct().

 * Minor simplifications in Math::BigInt->as_oct() and
   Math::BigInt::Calc::_as_oct().

1.999713 2015-12-31 pjacklam

 * Fix Math::BigInt->new(), which had a faulty handling in the shortcut for
   non-zero scalar integers with no non-zero exponent, like "12", "12.000",
   "12e3", and "12.000e4". Added tests for this in t/bigintpm.inc.

1.999712 2015-12-29 pjacklam

 * Fix bug in internal function _e_add() and _e_sub() which causes it to return
   "-0" in some cases.

 * Let new() be used for assignment. Now $x->new(3) assigns 3 to $x.

 * Improve code in new() for non-zero scalar integers with no exponent.

 * Allow both "inf" and "infinity". Allow a leading sign, and ignore letter
   case. This is to be consistent with core Perl.

 * Be more consistent about allowed whitespace in input. E.g., "23 " gave 23,
   but "inf " gave a NaN.

 * Core Perl allows both "0x" and "0X" as hexadecimal prefix, and both "0b" and
   "0B" as binary prefix, so we do too. Previously, only 0x and 0b were
   allowed.

 * Math::BigFloat now has its own from_bin() method which supports binary
   floating point numbers, e.g., "0b1.1001p-4". This complements from_hex().

 * Math::BigFloat now has its own from_oct() method which supports octal
   floating point numbers, e.g., "1.3267p-4". This complements from_hex().

 * The Math::BigInt and Math::BigFloat methods from_hex(), from_oct(), and
   from_bin() can now be used as instance methods to assign values to the
   invocand, e.g, $x->from_oct("10") assigns 8 to $x.

 * Update documentation. Perl now uses "Inf", not "inf" to represent infinity.

 * When the new() method is called with an undefined argument, the round
   parameters are now passed on to bzero(). This applies to both Math::BigInt
   and Math::BigFloat.

 * Replace "UNIVERSAL::isa($this, $that)" with "$this->isa($that)", and ditto
   for "can()", where possible. Not every instance of "UNIVERSAL::Isa()" has
   been replaced, though, since the change causes some tests to fail. This must
   be looked into.

 * Simplify the copy() methods. Always copy accuracy and precision parameters,
   even when they are undefined.

 * Reformat more of the code in accordancw with the "perlstyle" manual page.
   This makes the code a lot easier to read -- for me, anyway.

 * Use a more generic regex in t/calling.t, since the exact wording of the
   error message depends not on the Perl version, but on the module that does
   the version checking.

 * Avoid infinite loop in the Math::BigFloat->batan() method. Thanks to DANAJ
   (Dana Jacobsen) for the patch. This was not intended to be added before the
   next release, but was included in this release by accident.

1.9997_11 2015-12-10 pjacklam

This release introduces no changes in the library code, i.e., the .pm files in
the 'lib' directory, but there are a lot of changes in the test files. Since
there are so many changes, I let this be a development release.

 * Add 'use strict;' and 'use warnings;' to all test files.

 * Reformat code in the test files according to the "perlstyle" manual page.
   This makes the code a lot easier to read -- for me, anyway.

 * Decrement required version of Perl from v5.6.2 to v5.6.1. All tests pass
   when running the test suite with Perl 5.6.1 on Cygwin.

 * Replace "use vars ..." with "our ..." in test files.

 * Replace "BEGIN { unshift @INC, 't'; }" with "use lib 't';" in test files.

 * Use "our $x; $x = ...;" rather than "our $x = ...;" since the latter causes
   Perl 5.6.1 to complain about variables only used once.

 * Add comment to all tests. Now the tests no longer says just "ok 123", but
   rather "ok 123 - $x->blog(2)" etc. This makes it easier to identify failed
   tests, especially in the smoke testing reports.

 * Fix various flawed tests, e.g., ok($x, 2) was used testing whether $x was 2.

 * Use the skip() feature of Test::More for skipping tests.

 * Use more descriptive variable names in test files.

 * Remove unused variables in test files.

 * Move variable declarations to limit their scope in test files.

 * Remove trailing whitespace in test files.

 * Wrap (most) lines to fit 80 columns in test files.

1.999710 2015-11-12 pjacklam

 * New method Math::BigFloat -> from_hex() which supports hexadecimal floating
   point numbers, e.g., "0x1.999ap-4".

 * New test file t/from_hex-mbf.t for testing Math::BigFloat -> from_hex().

 * Add 'from_hex' and 'from_bin' to list of methods in the Math::BigInt POD.

1.999709 2015-11-06 pjacklam

 * Represent and return zero as 0E0, not 0E1. The old POD said "A zero is
   represented and returned as 0E1, not 0E0 (after Knuth)." I find no
   references to Knuth ever having said this. The closest reference I can find
   is that Knuth says 0**0 should be defined to be 1, not 0, but that is
   something else than 0e0, which is 0*10**0. I have yet to see any other
   mathematical software that represents and returns zero as 0e1 rather than
   0e0.

 * Required version of Test::More is 0.9301.

1.999708 2015-11-03 pjacklam

 * Use bxxx() method names consistently, rather than mixing bxxx() and fxxx()
   in code and test files. The fxxx() methods for Math::BigFloat objects are
   still available through autoloading. However, we leave the fround() method
   in Math::BigInt, as it seems to provide some kind of compatibility with
   Math::BigFloat.

 * Correct author information in the README file.

 * Remove INSTALL file, which by accident wasn't removed in v1.999707.

 * Use present tense, not past tense, in CHANGES file.

 * Add '#!perl' to Makefile.PL for correct syntax highlighting in editors
   supporting this.

 * Use Math::Complex::Inf() in testfiles also (for generating Perl scalar
   infinity) since it is more portable.

1.999707 2015-10-29 pjacklam

 * Add dependency on Math::Complex 1.39 for Math::Complex::Inf(), which is
   used for numifying infinity.

 * Update author information.

 * Update information in the file README.

 * Remove the files INSTALL and LICENSE as this information is already covered
   in the file README.

 * Enable 'use warnings' in all modules. We require a Perl newer than 5.6.0
   anyway.

 * Replace 'use vars ...' with 'our ...'. We require a Perl newer than 5.6.0
   anyway.

 * Avoid indirect object syntax in documentation.

 * Moved 'Test::More' from 'build_requires' to 'test_requires' in Makefile.PL.

1.999706 2015-10-28 pjacklam

 * Correct release date of v1.999705 in CHANGES.

 * Add code and tests for numify() on non-finite objects.

1.999705 2015-10-26 pjacklam

 * Avoid using "my" in a false conditional. See "Deprecated use of my() in
   false conditional" in perldiag(1).

 * Faster algorithm for bpi() when accuracy is >= 1000.

1.999704 2015-09-25 pjacklam

 * objectify() in lib/Math/BigInt.pm now uses 'isa' not 'eq' to check object
   relationship. This is necessary for correct handling of subclasses.

 * objectify() in lib/Math/BigInt.pm no longer expects as_int(), as_number()
   and as_float() to return objects, but allows them to return numbers
   formatted as strings. This is used by some other modules on CPAN.

 * Better documentation of as_int() and as_number() in lib/Math/BigInt.pm.

 * Add documentation for as_float() in lib/Math/BigFloat.pm

 * Add test files t/objectify_mbf.t and t/objectify_mbi.t.

1.999703 2015-09-21 pjacklam

 * Fix blog() in Math::BigInt and Math::BigFloat to work correctly regardless
   of the base.

 * Correct existing tests in bigintpm.inc and bigfltpm.inc.

 * Update test plans (number of tests) in t/bare_mbi.t, t/bigintpm.t, and
   t/sub_mbi.t.

 * Add test files t/blog-mbf.t and t/blog-mbi.t for better testing of the
   blog() methods.

1.999702 2015-09-17 pjacklam

 * The overloaded log() is a unary operator, so don't pass additional
   arguments.

 * Fix blog() so the cases $x->blog() and $x->blog(undef) work correctly. An
   undefined base means that blog() should use base e (Euler's number).

 * Both CORE::log() and other mathematical software returns inf for log(inf),
   so we do the same.

 * Add tests for log() as well as templates for future tests of the other
   overloadable functions.

 * Improve descriptions of a few tests.

1.999701 2015-09-11 pjacklam

 * The POD documentation, as well as the comments in the code, said that
   $x->bdiv($y) in list context should return quotient $q and remainder $r so
   that $x = $q * $y + $r, and that the remainder (modulo) $r should correspond
   to Perl's % operator as well as the bmod() method. This has not been the
   actual behaviour. This is now fixed. In scalar context, only the quotient is
   returned.

 * Clearer POD documentation for the bdiv() and bmod() methods.

 * All non-integer input values to Math::BigInt gave a NaN, except non-zero
   numbers in the range (-1,1) that were written without an exponent, e.g.,
   "-0.75" and "0.5". Now also these return a NaN.

 * Input values with a large (absolute value) negative exponent, e.g.,
   1e-9999999, now return NaN. The former behaviour was to die with the message
   "Quantifier in {,} bigger than 32766 in regex; marked by ..."

 * Intermediate computations in blog() increased the number of digits
   significantly in some cases. Now reduce the number of digits by rounding.
   However, keep some extra digits for remaining intermediate computations
   before the final rounding.

 * When $x is a Math::BigFloat, $x -> bceil() and $x -> bint() for -1 < $x < 0
   returned -0. Negative zero is never used by Math::Big(Int|Float), and care
   has been taken to avoid it, so this bug is surely an oversight.

 * Explicitly specify the backend (lib => 'Calc') in t/mbimbf.t for easier
   release management of the backend distributions.

 * Add "use warnings" to test scripts, since Perl 5.6.2 is required anyway, and
   "use warnings" was introduced in Perl 5.6.1.

 * Modified test scripts so the difference between the test files in the
   Math-BigInt distribution and the backend distributions are as few and as
   small as possible. This makes for easier release management.

1.993 2011-02-26 pjacklam

 * Change default backend library from Math::BigInt::FastCalc to
   Math::BigInt::Calc, which is included in the Math-BigInt distro. This
   avoids recursive distribution dependency (RT #65976) (Peter John Acklam).

1.992 2011-02-18 pjacklam

 * Math::BigInt::Calc->_nok(): Use symmetry property nok(n,k) = nok(n,n-k) to
   speed up execution when k is large. Also general code cleanup. (Peter John
   Acklam).
 * Math::BigInt::Calc->_gcd(): Speed up by reducing amount of data copying
   (Peter John Acklam).
 * Add '01load.t' for basic module loading and diagnostics useful for
   debugging. Rename '00-signature.t' to '00sig.t', 'pod.t' to '02pod.t', and
   'pod_cov.t' to '03podcov.t' (Peter John Acklam).
 * Math::BigInt:: Make from_hex(), from_oct(), and behave more like hex() and
   oct() in the Perl core, and make from_bin() consistent with from_hex() and
   from_oct() (this is related to RT #58954) (Peter John Acklam).
 * Math::BigInt::Calc->_rem(): Modify first input arg always, not just
   sometimes (Peter John Acklam).
 * Math::BigInt::Calc->_modinv(): be more consistent with the _modinv() method
   in other libraries (Math::BigInt::GMP, etc.) (Peter John Acklam)
 * Math::BigInt::Calc->_nok(): use symmetry property nok(n,k) = nok(n,n-k).
   This cuts computation time tremendously when n and k are large (Peter John
   Acklam).
 * Math::BigInt::Calc->_gcd(): quickly handle zero cases, avoid code
   duplication, and always modify the first input argument in-place (Peter John
   Acklam).

 * Fix typos (Peter John Acklam).

1.991 2011-02-05 pjacklam

   Math::BigInt::GMP). This makes older versions of Math::BigInt::GMP
   work with latest version of Math::BigInt (Peter John Acklam).
 * Correct and extend API documentation (Peter John Acklam).

 * shortcut for numbers of same length in _div, where X > Y

0.42 2004-10-10 Tels

 * fix critical bug in _from_hex() with parts that were to big for one part
   (introduced in v1.72, thanx Mark Lakata for finding it!)

0.41 2004-07-30 Tels

 * from_hex() convert 28 bits (vs 16) at a time, faster (helps from_bin(), too)
 * potential bug in padding with '0' in _digit()
 * fixed undef warnings in fceil(0.222222222222...) (thanx kenny!)
 * removed the unused integer-detection code and combined the two BEGIN blocks

0.40 2004-03-12 Tels

 * added: api_version(), _ten(), _two(), _is_ten(), _is_two(), _gcd()
 * streamlined: is_foo() methods
 * _new() takes scalar, not scalar ref
 * _str() returns scalar, not scalar ref
 * _and(): bugfix for [perl #26559]: negative arguments that are shorter
    than the positive one caused an error due to cutting instead padding
 * _ior(): forgot to calculate the proper sing of result, making, for
    instance, 30 | -4 go wrong

0.39 2004-01-25 Tels (not released)

0.38 2003-12-30 Tels

 * guess _log_int() result based on $base if $base < $BASE
 * _pow() handle cases 0 ** Y, 1 ** Y, X ** 0 and X ** 1
 * _new(): shortcut for short numbers, makes MBI->new() about 20% faster
 * _root() was wrong for numbers like 9 (0b1001) because they start with
   the pattern /^0b1(0+)/ (missing '$' in regexp) and after fixing this
   it was dead slow for large numbers.

0.37 2003-12-11 Tels

 * implemented _log_int() with a simple and fast "iterative" method
 * fixed bug in _root(): int() rounds sometimes wrong, so use sprintf()
 * _as_bin() and _as_hex() are faster (for small values) due to inlining
   is_zero()
 * _acmp() is about 26% faster for very small numbers or numbers that
   differ in length, and slightly faster for bigger numbers. This helps
   both bacmp() and bcmp()
 * _fac() did:
   + not modify $x in place for small arguments
   + something strange for large arguments
   + not handle 0..2 optimal (code now simplified)
 * _as_bin() used %b, which was not known to v5.5.3 - workaround that
 * implemented _log_int(), which is simple and very fast
 * implemented the missing pieces for _root() (which is quite fast)

0.36 2003-08-31 Tels

 * fixed a bug in div_use_div() that computed remainder wrong if X == X and
   X was very large
 * fixed a off-by-one error discovered with mbi_rand.t in _div_use_XXX()
   (one internal in $x overflowed, thus the wrong computation)

0.35 2003-07-06 Tels

 * fixed a bug in _floor() which caused ffloor(0.1234567) to fail.
   (Thanx to cpan@ali.as for finding it and sending a fix/testcases)
 * make _as_hex() and _as_bin() handle 0, and make them faster for very
   short numbers (less than BASE_LEN digits)

0.34 2002-09-27 Tels

 * fixed bug in mul_use_div() shortcut that used * $RBASE instead of / $MBASE
 * $caught & 1 != 0 vs ($caught & 1) != 0 (changed to $caught != 2)

 * removed unused LEN_CONVERT code (smaller memory footprint)

0.33 2002-09-09 Tels

 * _fac() keep $n as scalar if possible
 * test for when to USE_MUL or not was inverted
 * _mul() is about 6 times faster if $y is small and $x is big

0.32 2002-08-21 Tels

 * fixed bug in _rsft() that did not set result to 0 in some cases
 * _modinv() now works, thanx to the all-positive algorithm

0.28 2002-05-30 Tels

 * added _modinv(), _modpow() (not yet implemented)

0.26 2002-03-17 Tels

 * a fix in _rsft() that left empty array instead of (0)
 * a fix in _sub(): early out made -1 + 100000000001 == 0 (if length($y) > 8)

0.25 2002-03-03 Tels

 * started _square() (not done yet)

0.24 2002-02-27 Tels

 * streamlined _mod() shortcuts
 * _div() has shortcut if $y is very small

0.23 2002-02-24 Tels

 * from_bin() repack input and use from_hex(): twice as fast

0.22 2002-02-10 Tels

 * _sqrt1() => _sqrt() (oups)
 * much better guess for _sqrt() resulting in faster sqrt
 * added _fac()

0.20 2002-01-07 Tels

 * better detection of higher-int-only base (but disabled due to failures)
 * streamlined converting
 * turned dual-basis off by default (now 7-7 on 32 bit and 9-9 on most 64 it)
 * _str() uses int() on first part to avoid '0000' instead of '0'

0.19 2001-12-23 Tels

 * first working version of using two different bases: one for mul/div, the
   other for all other ops, including converting via _to_large()/_to_small()

0.18 2001-12-20 Tels

 * added _as_hex() and _as_bin() with 16 bit chunks

 * added _sqrt() for more speed
 * _sqrt() shortcut for small (< $BASE) numbers for better performance
 * shortcut in _mul for small numbers (< $BASE_LEN2)
 * added _and, _or, and _xor and let them use more than 16 bits
 * find out how many bits _and, _or and _xor can safely use (cap at 23)
 * div() might leave empty array, so __strip_zeros fixes these
 * streamlined _acmp()
 * cap of 5 for BASE for UTS and UNICOS/Cray

 * fixed also a bug in that new code
 * also the speedup in mul() occurs with $x having lots of zeros, not $y.
 * first argument is always classname, so removed checks and shift
 * shift in base ten by _lsft() and _rsft()

0.06 2001-07-09 Tels

##############################################################################
Math::BigFloat:

1.60 2008-04-20 Tels

 * fix #34459: bsqrt() breaks on floats with enough digits (Thanx Niko Tyni!)
 * fix #35238: batan2() handles inf/+inf wrong
 * fix #35162: MBI segfault (as_number(Math::BigRat()) was wrong)

1.58 2007-06-30 Tels

 * remove Exporer from @ISA
 * support config('lib') as shortcut for config()->{lib}
 * add bpi(), bcos(), bsin(), batan(), batan2() methods
 * add bmuladd()
 * streamline the is_xxx() and copy() methods

1.57 2007-05-05 Tels

 * add bnok() method (n over k)
 * add all the missing modify() hooks

1.55 2007-04-16 Tels

 * make bexp() much faster (esp. under GMP) by caching the first coefficients
   and rewriting the inner loop
 * support "try" and "only" in import()

1.54 2007-04-09 Tels

 * fix bug #21747: Re: weirdity in bignum... (powers and high precision):
   infinite loops for blog() (and consequently bpow()) if you requested
   an accuracy greater than 67 digits (uses _log() now, and not blog())
   Thanx to darconc!
 * cache the result of _log(2) and _log(10) so that subsequent calculations
   can re-use the already done work
 * instead of computing _log(10), compute _log(1.25) and _log(2) and then do:
    _log(1.25 * 2 * 2 * 2) = _log(1.25) + _log(2) + _log(2) + _log(2)
   This makes computing _log(10) much faster, so that computing blog(N) is
   about a factor of 5 faster when N >= 10 or N <= 0.1
 * add bexp()

1.53 2007-03-04 Tels

 * fix #25144: [PATCH] Math::BigFloat->new considers any reference a BigInt
   (Thanx mschwern!)
 * fix bug #13866: NaN (in bignum queue)
 * fix bug #21586: Incorrect result when comparing with NaN
 * fix bug #15896: "==" overloading is broken for "NaN"

1.52 2007-01-27 Tels

 * make as_int() return a BigInt, too (not just as_number()) (bug #21412)
 * add as_oct()
 * bpow(): handle negative X and negative Y (instead of returning NaN)

1.51 2005-04-10 Tels

 * fix new() to work with Math::BigInt::Pari

1.50 2005-03-29 Tels

 * fix rounding doc, add notes about prevision vs. accuracy
 * set FastCalc as default (we still use whatever MBI uses)

1.49 2005-03-20 Tels

 * remove dependecy on Scalar::Util in bdiv()
 * bdiv() cache result of "!$y->is_one()" for wantarray case to make
   ($res,$rem) = $x->bdiv($y); about 10% faster

1.48 2005-01-01 Tels

 * use new interface to _scale_a() and _scale_p() in BigInt
 * add bneg() and inline is_zero() in it, making it 1.6 times faster
 * replace ref($_[0]) w/ undef when it isn't actually needed. This
   makes some ops (bsstr(), bneg etc) about 2% faster for small numbers
 * use MBI::_register_callback() to get notified of lib changes
 * bgcd()/blcm() never worked, so fix them for integers and add tests

1.47 2004-10-10 Tels

 * inf/NaN fixes for bpow()
 * eliminate the need for _zeros() in new() (speed-up for GMP et. al.)
 * eliminate _is_zero() in new() (small speed up)

1.46 2004-08-13 Tels

 * blog(10,10) ($x == $y) returned '1.0000...' instead of '1'

1.45 2004-07-30 Tels

 * simple inherit bsub() from BigInt, also fixes bsub() failing under
   $x -= $x - Thanx Peter J. Acklam!
 * bdiv() failed when passed a variable twice (thanx Peter J. Acklam!)
 * bfround() and bround() are about 10% faster when going via Math::BigInt's
   bround() due to constructing a fake BigInt instead of going via ->new()
 * fixed undef warnings in bpow(0,$y) ($y non-integer) (thanx kenny!)

1.44 2004-03-12 Tels

 * bpow() computed -X ** Y wrong for Y that are odd
 * use $HALF instead of 0.5 to speed up broot()
 * use Calc instead of BigInt for parts, that makes it roughly 2x faster
   it also saves memory (419 vs. 767 bytes per (small number) object)
 * bmod() did needlessly test for NaN arguments twice

1.43 2004-01-13 Tels

 * small fixes in AUTOLOAD
 * delete $x->{_a} vs. $x->{_a} = undef to save memory

1.42 2003-12-30 Tels

 * ffac(inf) is inf, not NaN
 * flog() calculate integer result first, and if it fits, return it
   this makes it much faster in case the result is a perfect integer
 * require (instead of use) Exporter
 * froot() calculates an integer result first, and it if fits, returns it

1.41 2003-12-11 Tels

 * flog(): 0.5, 0.25, 0.125, 2, 4 and 8 were not scaled properly back to
   1, instead they remained 0.5 and 2, respectively. This was a '<' vs.
   '>=' respective '<' vs. '<=' issue. No other values are affected
   (neither getting slower nor faster), but the ones in question (incl.
   their multiples like 20, 80, 0.0125 etc) are now tremendously faster -
   about a factor of 30 to 60! :-)
 * removed some crufty logic from _log_10() and made the special cases of
   2, 10 and 0.1 slightly faster. This also helps log($x,2) and log($x,10).
 * bfac() slightly faster for small arguments
 * downgrading to bigint failed for .2e2 (produced 200 vs. 20)

1.40 2003-09-23 Tels

 * bstr(): removed unnec. BigInt math and inlined is_zero() => great speedup
   (10% to factor 6.5 depending on input)
 * replace $self->_one() by $self->bone()

1.39 2003-07-06 Tels

 * $x->blog($base) can handle a $base which is a Math::Bigint
 * replace die() with Carp::croak

1.39 2002-11-03 Tels

 * $x->bpow($y,0), $x->blog($base,0) and $x->bdiv($y,0) were still not doing
    the right thing and no tests caught it *sigh*
 * blog():
   + MUCH faster when $x > 10 or $x < 0.1 (constant time vs.
     time * 10 when doubling/halving $x)
   + also much faster if $x has many digits (like 1/3 or 123**123)
   + for $x < 1 and $x > 0 did not work at all (bacmp vs bcmp)
   + returns now NaN if $base <= 0 or $base == 1
   + does handle other bases than "undef" (aka e) properly now
 * require Math::BigFloat did not work (opposed to BigInt, where it does)
 * _pow() suffered the same bug of bacmp vs bcmp (so 0.2 ** 0.2 failed)
 * removed unused _pow2() routine
 * _find_round_parameters() returns ($x,$a,$p,$r) and not ($a,$p,$r), so
   use it correctly, and also test for $x = NaN afterwards
  (happens when $a and $p were set and thus $x became NaN)
 * bsqrt() failed since v1.63 for values like 0.2, 0.002, 0.00134 etc
 * added broot() method (albeit slow for now)
 * $x->is_one('-') was broken (never returned true for $x == -1)
 * config() can take arguments and set them, croak on wrong ones
 * config(trap_nan => 1) to manipulate former $NaNOK variable
 * config(trap_inf => 1), too
 * trap_nan/trap_inf really croak on any attempt to create an NaN/inf
 * spellings of Bigint => BigInt
 * simplify config() by using SUPER::config()

1.38 2002-09-08 Tels

 * fix that bsqrt() would hang for certain inputs. Instead of using Newton's,
   we now rely on the fact that sqrt(x*y) = sqrt(x) * sqrt(y) by setting y to
   100. This removes the while loop entirely and makes it much faster while
   fixing the bug at the same time.
 * $x->bsqrt(0) did needless warn about undef values, and round to 4 digits
   instead of beeing equivalent to $x->bsqrt(undef)
 * ditto for $x->bpow($y,0), $x->blog($base,0) and $x->bdiv($y,0)
 * use File::Spec was needless, since it was required later on again

1.37 2002-08-20 Tels

 * $x->new("0.02"); $x->accuracy($a); $x->bdiv($y,$d) failed to round
   when $d > $a
 * numify() returned '+inf' instead of 'inf'
 * (more) tests for bsstr(), numify(), as_hex(), as_bin

1.35 2002-07-07 Tels

 * bfround() used accidentally BigInt math; is now about 5.6 times faster for
   small numbers
 * bdiv()/badd() etc skip objectify() if possible and are thus faster
 * doc for accuracy()/precision()
 * $x->bmod() was not modifying $x in place when returning NaN/inf/-inf
 * avoid unec. calls to objectify() for binary op's

1.34 2002-06-10 Tels

 * upgrade used badd() instead of bmul() inside bmul() (again! arg!)

 * $x->bpow(0.5) optimized to $x->bsqrt();

1.30 2002-02-25 Tels

 * bug in bsub() with not rounding when $x->bsub(0) was also in MBF
 * bcmp() and bacmp() 5 times faster due to numify() (might have now impose a
   limit on exponent - but I couldn't find a test that breaks it)
 * streamlined ffloor() and fceil()
 * fixed bug in $x->bsub(0) and $x->badd(0) (both forgot to round result)
 * new() downgrade integers if $downgrade is in effect
 * optimized fpow() (one is_zero() less)
 * optimized as_number (nearly twice as fast)
 * $x->badd(0) forgot to round $x
 * downgrade and upgrade are valid methods for inheritance

1.29 2002-02-24 Tels

 * fsqrt() didn't modify $x sometimes, but returned a new reference
 * fsqrt(): calc 4 more digits for rounding, not 1 (endless looping otherwise)
 * fmod() now actually works

 * bsqrt(): moved is_zero() || is_one() test out of the way => 28% faster

   a _sqrt() routine (BareCalc, BitVect and Pari are affected, Calc, FastCalc
   and GMP were not)

1.62 2002-08-21 Tels

 * bcmp()/bacmp() upgrade now if requested

 * shortcuts to avoid calls to objectify for add/sub/mul/div/mod/pow/bcmp etc
 * fix overloaded bcmp() so that the objectify()-avoidance kicks in
 * avoid calling round() when BigFloat requested 'no rounding please'
 * bcmp()'s shortcut for comparing x <=> 0, 0 <=> 0, 0 <=> $y was making things
   slower than just handing the compare to Calc. Even more so for Pari et al.
 * $x->accuracy() and $x->precision() returned undef, instead of 0 if
   A/P of $x was 0 and global A/P was undef.
 * $x->bmod() did not modify $x in place when returning NaN/inf/-inf
 * some binary ops (band/bxor/bior/bpow) were not properly rounding the result
   to the requested A/P/R; the same ops also forgot to take $y into account

 * '$x = scalar (**|%|+|-|*|\) $object;' failed (was not tested, either)
 * 'if ($x)' is now O(1) instead of O(N) and at least twice as fast
 * fixed nasty bug in _digits that caused <=> after add/sub/mul etc to fail
   if result was between 100001 and 109999, added test for this

 * overload +=, -=, *= and /= for about 20-30% more speed if both args have
   roughly same length
 * shortcut in add() makes $x += $y; $x -= $y; for large $x and small $y
   an O(1) case instead of O(N)
 * fixed (non-critical) bug that caused objectify in numify/bool/stringify to
   create scratch objects from undef params.

1.13 2001-02-18 Tels

 * got rid of duplicated copy() code in new()

1.12 2001-02-16 Tels

 * accidentally dropped self-multiply test in bigintpm.t
 * fixed bug in overloading cmp
 * after correcting the overload for 'cmp', I got a lot of test failings and
   finally discovered that the bstr()'s return of '[+-][0-9]+' instead of
   Perls ways of '[-]?[0-9]+' breaks string comparisons with numbers :(
   F.i. ok() from Test.pm uses 'eq' and you can not do ok($a,3*3) where $a
   is a BigInt. IMNSHO clearly wrong. And only changing the way cmp is
   overloaded would lead to the curios situation that the following:
   'print "$a eq $b" if $a eq $b;' would print "+3 eq 3", which looks wrong.
   Mark B. said go ahead and change bstr(), so I changed it ;) to drop
   the '+', adapted all the tests, changed the doc, etc.
   BigInts behave now transparently like build-in scalars in integer/string
   context ;o)

1.11 2001-02-14 Tels (first release)

 * fixed bug in band(), bxor(), etc that used badd($x, fixed_number_here);
 * since subclasses might not be happy with fixed numbers, make sure we pass
   BigInts all the time if using something like $someclass->badd();
 * fixed bug in band/bxor/bior which destroyed second argument
 * bxor/band/bior work now correctly for subclasses
 * ++ and -- are now a tad (ca 5%) faster

 * testing for undefined fixes this problem (but might waste more time for
 * a new(0), will save time on average.

##############################################################################
Math::BigRat:

0.2624 2022-06-27

 * Improve stringification. Better handling of upgrading/downgrading in
   stringification methods. Add new method bfstr() for compatibility with
   Math::BigInt og Math::BigFloat. Add new author test files to confirm.

0.2623 2022-05-16

 * Fix rounding issues.

0.2622 2022-04-13

 * Add more cases for downgrading, and more tests.

0.2621 2022-04-11

 * Improve downgrading and upgrading.

0.2620 2021-10-03

 * Skip tests that don't work on older Perls. Also skip tests that compare
   floating point numbers.

0.2619 2021-10-01

 * Correct the handling of Inf and NaN in numify().

 * Improve constant overloading. When numeric constants are overloaded
   (with the ":constant" option) in Math::BigRat, every numeric constant
   is converted to an object regardless of how it is written.

0.2618 2021-09-28

 * Add new method binv() for the inverse.

 * Add new method dparts(), which returns the integer part and fraction part
   of a number. For example, 9/4 is split into 2 and 1/4. This method is
   equivalent to the Math::BigInt and Math::BigFloat methods with the same
   name.

 * Improve blog(). Handle cases $x->blog($b) where the numerator of $x
   and/or $b is 1 as special.

 * Sync tests with Math-BigInt.

0.2617 2021-07-12

 * Fix CPAN RT #132712.

 * Reorganize existing test files and add more test files.

0.2616 2021-07-12

 * Better Makefile.PL.

 * Update the BUGS and SUPPORT sections in the POD.

 * Update README.

0.2614 2018-04-17

 * Fix bug in bpow() (CPAN RT #124002). Add tests to verify fix.

 * Fix bug in is_one(). The code $x->is_one("-") returned false when $x was -1
   and true when $x was 1. Add tests to verify fix.

 * Improve bsqrt() so it returns the exact result when possible.

 * Fix documentation errors.

 * The tests now require Test::More version 0.88 or newer.

 * Add test files t/release-portability.t, t/release-test-version.t, and
   t/release-cpan-changes.t.

 * Update TODO file.

 * Prefer as_int() to as_number(), since what is does is return an integer.

 * Expand tabs to spaces and clean up whitepace.

 * Convert test file t/02pod.t to t/release-pod.t and t/03podcov.t to
   t/release-pod-coverage.t.

 * Reformat CHANGES to match the specification in CPAN::Changes::Spec and
   CPAN::Meta::Spec.

 * Better testing of NaN and Inf trapping.

 * Use $class->config("xyz") rather than $class->config()->{xyz}.

 * Add more tests of is_inf() to catch bugs like the one that was in is_one().
   Specifically, make sure we test is_inf() with and without a sign argument.

 * Use $LIB for the math backend library class.

 * Reformat test data in t/bigratpm.inc.

 * Import carp() and croak() from Carp.

 * Make tests pass when '.' is not in @INC (CPAN RT #120892).

 * Remove t/bigroot.t and t/biglog.t which didn't test Math::BigRat at all.

0.2613 2017-06-16 pjacklam

 * Fix problem with second operand being changed in multiplication (CPAN RT
   #121139).

0.2612 2017-03-01 pjacklam

 * Improve the logic in blog() to determine how to call objectify(). The old,
   simpler logic didn't handle an undefined base correctly.

 * Fix bexp() which was objectifying one argument too many.

 * Don't quote the version number of a use'd module.

0.2611 2016-12-13 pjacklam

 * Add more logic to Makefile.PL regarding INSTALLDIRS (CPAN RT #119199
   and #119225).

0.2610 2016-12-11 pjacklam

 * Fix Makefile.PL so that this module installs over the core version.

0.2609 2016-12-03 pjacklam

 * Use ExtUtils::MakeMaker rather than Module::Install in Makefile.PL

 * Remove INSTALL file. The information is in the README file.

 * Inform in the BUGS file that the file may not be up to date.

 * Inform in the TODO file that the file may not be up to date.

 * Update AUTHOR information in Math/BigRat.pm.

 * Remove author information in LICENSE file.

 * Update README file.

 * Minor POD reformatting in lib/Math/BigRat.pm.

0.260805 2016-11-15 pjacklam

 * Standardize on using $LIB for the variable holding the class of the backend
   library.

 * Improve bmul() by doing _gcd() twice on smaller numbers rather than once on
   larger numbers.

0.260804 2016-04-25 pjacklam

 * Revert the change to the blsft() and brsft() methods, which truncated the
   input (and output) to integers. However, now convert the base to an object
   only when the base isn't an object already. Also return NaN if any of the
   three operands is a NaN.

 * Overloaded 'int' should not modify it's argument.

 * The first output argument from objectify() is the class name, so use the
   variable name $class, not $self.

 * In Makefile.PL, change "build_requires 'Test::More' => 0.47" to
   "test_requires 'Test::More' => 0.47". Test::More is only needed for testing,
   not for building.

0.260803 2016-04-22 pjacklam

 * Add methods bnan(), binf(), bzero(), and bone(). The old code was based on
   an undocumented behaviour where the superclass made assumptions about the
   subclass.

 * Fix tests where ok() was used incorrectly, like ok($got, $expected).

 * Remove "require Carp", since we have "use Carp" in the heading.

 * Completly rewrite new(). It was buggy and hard to maintain.

 * Add more descriptions to tests.

 * Rename blog-mbr.t to author-blog-mbr.t.

 * Simplify bsqrt() and blog(). Don't assume we know the internals of
   Math::BigFloat objects.

 * Change bmodpow() and bmodinv() so they handle all input arguments.
   Non-integers are truncated to integers.

 * Change internals of bnok().

 * as_float() and numify() should not make assumptions about the internals of
   Math::BigFloat objects.

 * Wrap long lines.

 * Fix typo in POD ("conversation" -> "conversion").

 * Make internal functions _new_from_float() and _new_from_int() redundant and
   remove them. They make assumtions about the internals of Math::BigFloat
   objects and Math::BigInt objects, respectively.

 * Make internal function _as_float() redundant and remove it.

 * Add methods band(), bior(), bxor(), and bnot().

0.260802 2015-12-28 pjacklam

 * Fix blog(). The handling of inf and NaN was broken. It also returned
   incorrect result in several cases, especially when both the operand and the
   base were both integers. In some cases, the correct result was returned,
   but the operand was not set to this value. An undefined base (indicating
   that Euler's number e should be used) was not handled correctly.

 * Update author information in Makefile.PL.

 * Add tests for log() in t/bigratpm.inc as well as templates for the other
   overloaded functions exp, sin, cos, atan2, int, abs, and sqrt.

 * Update number of tests in t/bigratpm.t.

 * Add test file t/blog-mbr.t.

 * Reformat tests and add comments/descriptions to them.

 * Accept both "Inf" and "Infinity", ignoring letter case, and letting the
   sign be optional. This matches the current behaviour of core Perl.

 * Internal clean-up of the copy() method.

 * Remove all occurences of "require Carp", since we "use Carp".

 * Reformat some of the code to make the code more readable (for me, at least)
   and more in accordance with the guidelines in the "perlstyle" man page.

 * Correct some errors in the comments in the code.

 * Use "our ..." rather than "use vars ...".

 * Rename variables so they have more descriptive names and are more in
   accordance with the Math-BigInt distribution.

 * Remove unused variables.

 * Use "use lib 't'" rather than "unshift @INC, 't'".

 * Include "use strict" and "use warnings" in all files.

0.260801 2015-09-14 pjacklam

 * Added support for bdiv() in list context. Added corresponding tests.

 * Changed bmod() so the result corresponds to Perl's % operator, as well as
   the second output argument of bdiv() in list contest. Modified tests
   correspondingly. Now the behaviour of bmod() is consistent between
   Math::BigInt, Math::BigFloat, and Math::BigRat.

 * Clearer POD for the bdiv() and bmod() methods.

 * Display more information about loaded modules.

0.2608 2015-08-28 pjacklam

  * Wrap long lines.

  * Increment version number. (Sync with blead.)

0.2607 2015-08-28 pjacklam

  * Misc. updates.

  * Update bundled version of Module::Install from v1.00 to v1.08.

  * Fix spelling errors.

  * Avoid negative zero.

  * Various POD corrections.

  * Add refereces to CPAN testers, CPAN RT etc.

  * Test to avoid negative zero.

0.2602 2011-02-13 pjacklam (1000 tests)

 * Fix spelling errors (Peter John Acklam).

 * Include latest versions test scripts shared with the Math::BigInt
   distribution (Peter John Acklam).

 * Add 00sig.t for testing the SIGNATURE file, 01load.t for explicitly
   testing module loading and showing version information useful for
   debugging (Peter John Acklam).

 * Replace pod.t and pod_cov.t by 02pod.t as a generic script for testing
   POD syntax, and 03podcov.t as a more generic script for testing POD
   coverage (Peter John Acklam).

0.26 2010-09-15 rafl 975 tests

 * Remove obsolete test boilerplate that was once needed to test within the
   perl core (Nicholas Clark).

 * Convert tests from Test to Test::More (Nicholas Clark).

0.15 2005-04-02 Tels 924 tests

 * no need to require Exporter

 * rem no longer used 'with' from import

 * add a few comments here and there

 * fix import()'s handling of the lib argument (it didn't work)

 * fix segfault under trap_nan in _bnan()

 * remove unused IMPORT logic (require BigRat seems to work without it)

0.14 2005-01-01 Tels 924 tests

 * require Math::BigInt v1.74

 * streamline copy()

 * inline is_zero() into bneg(), making it about 50% faster

 * more tests for bneg()

 * register callback to get notified of lib changes from Math::BigInt

 * much simpler import() logic

 * new() accepts input like new(Math::BigInt->new(123),Math::BigInt->new(7));

 * doc: as_hex(), as_bin(), add note about as_pos(), as_neg() and as_int()

 * numify() now deals with large N and D by using BigFloat (Thanx Hugo!)

 * numify() lost the sign on negative integer values (Thanx Zefram!)

0.13 2004-10-22 Tels 892 tests

 * fixed digit(): it never worked due to dropping the second parameter

 * fixed a bug in brsft() when passing arguments (2 vs. 3 in objectify)

 * use Math::BigInt->config('lib') for parts instead of Math::BigInt
   + This makes everything go about 2..4 times faster :)
   + And it saves memory (408 vs. 807 bytes for a simple number)

 * _as_float() is about 6 times as fast for integers (e.g. 123/1 vs. 2/3)

 * denominator() returns 1 for +inf and -inf (+inf/1, -inf/1) instead of +-inf

 * when using "lib => GMP;", certain things never worked:
   + sqrt() was not possible
   + new("2.3") did not work
   + new("12.3e-2") did not work

0.12 2004-02-15 Tels 863 tests

 * fixed bug in is_one() (segfault under v.5.6.x)

 * implemented length() and digit() for integers

 * beefed up testing class Test.pm to make more float tests work (185 of them
   still fail)

 * added AUTOLOAD to load fxxx() stubs (for BigFloat compatibility tests)

 * $IMPORT for require and AUTOLOAD

 * added as_bin(), as_hex() which work for integers, NaN, and +-inf

 * implement broot() and blog() for non-integer numbers

 * fixed blsft()/brsft() to work with undefined or scalar base

 * added a copy() method to be independend from BigInt's copy()

 * adopted to new internal format of Math::BigFloat v1.44 (from BigInt v1.70)

0.11 2004-01-07 Tels 859 tests

 * require Exporter vs. use it

 * more tests for bacmp(), bnorm()

 * fixed bug in bacmp() with ($x,[+-]inf) (Thanx to William T. Morgan!)

 * fixed bug in new("+-inf/X") (e.g. "-inf/5" resulted in "inf", not "-inf")

 * delete _a and _p on _d and _n, reduces size of a BigRat object from
   887 bytes to 767 bytes on a x86 32 bit system. This also makes some
   operations slightly (single-digit percentages) faster.

 * bacmp() is about 20% faster

 * bcmp() is:
   * about 4 times faster if sign($x) != sign($y)
   * about 20% faster if sign($x) == sign($y)

 * added broot(), bmodinv(), bmodpow(), blog() so that their equivalent of:
    # perl -MMath::BigRat=:constant -le '$a = 2.0 ** 32; print $a->broot(4)'
     Can't call method "copy" on an undefined value at BigFloat.pm line 1442.
   works now for integer arguments and inf/NaN, at least.

 * doc: rationales => rational numbers

0.10 2003-07-06 Tels 751 tests (released on 2003-08-13)

 * one more die => croak conversion

 * fix inf/NAN handling in new()

 * fix bsqrt(3/4) and similiar cases failing with some obscure error, this was
   a simple typo ({_n} vs. {_m}). Added tests for that.

 * numify() is now much faster (38400 vs 720 tries/s on 2Ghz AMD XP2400+)

 * support for :trap_nan/:trap_inf

 * doc for config()

 * implement trapping of creation of NaN/inf/-inf

 * as_number() forgot to disable $upgrade, resulting in BigRat again when
   run under -Mbigrat -- thanx to Ian Phillips.

 * fixed a bug in new() that failed with
    Math::BigRat->new(Math::BigInt::Lite->new(123));

 * fixed new() to work better under
    use Math::BigRat with => 'Math::BigInt::Lite';

 * add a test for "require Math::BigRat; $x = Math::BigRat->new(123); $x++;"
   (it already works since we "use Math::BigFloat;"

 * require Carp; Carp::croak () instead of simple die()

 * implemented bmod() - Thanx Ian Phillips.

 * bsqrt() now returns a big rationale - Ian again

 * tests for bmod(), as_number(), bsqrt() and some NaN cases

 * bfloor()/bceil() broke under use bigrat; due to missing upgrade-disabling

0.09 2002-08-14 Tels

 * documentation was lacking a proper description, METHODS missing etc

 * setting accuracy/precision in BigFloat/BigInt interfered with BigRat

 * new testcases for the A/P fix in t/big_ap.t

 * speedup: apply the same trick to avoid calls to objectify() like in BigInt

 * speedup: badd()/bsub() did needless gcd(), copy() and bdiv()

 * speedup: workaround for 'x.y.z'-valid bug in BigFloat no longer neccessary

0.08 2002-08-13 Tels

 * bsstr() returned positive result for negative numbers - Oups!

 * added a numify() so that $array[Math::BigRat->new('17/8')] works

0.07 2002-06-04 Tels

 * bfac() now works for integers (x/1), and returns $x->bnan() instead of
   Math::BigRat->bnan() (modify in-place)

 * bpow() faster for x/1 ** y/1 and x/z ** y/1 cases (some of the speedups are
   two-digit factors :) - also some bugfixes

 * bpow() no longer litters stdout

 * removed some (all of them commented out) debug prints to reduce footprint

 * shortened testfile bigrat.t

 * some hardcoded 'Math::BigInt' replaced with '$MBI'

 * bceil() would leave -0 in some cases

 * (more) tests (all in all 628) for:
   bceil/bfloor/bpow/bfac/parts/denominator/nominator/binc/bdec

 * parts('-3/1') would return (3,1) instead of (-3,1)

 * parts() did not work for NaN, +inf, -inf

 * numerator()/denominator() did not work for inf,-inf,NaN

 * new('1.2.2') was valid (resulted in 12/10 due to bug in BigFloat)

 * new() for some cases left internal state not as 0/0 for NaN, inf, -inf etc

 * binc()/bdec() were missing entirely

0.06 2002-05-23 Tels

 * bcmp/bacmp/as_number/bfloor/bceil work now

 * bsqrt() is better now

 * t/Math/BigInt/Test.pm is fixed now and makes a much better figure
   (formerly almost all of the 1500 tests in bigfltrt.inc would fail. Now we
   fail "only" 868 of 2014 tests, and most of them since the test dies early.

 * added stubs for round, bfround, bround and certain others
