        This is a maintenance release. The code contains no functional change.
        Satisfied users of version 0.13 can skip this update.
        + Tst : Author tests are no longer bundled with this distribution.
                They are only made available to authors in the git repository.
        + Tst : Threads tests will not fail anymore if resources constraints
                prevent the system from creating all the required threads.

0.13    2010-03-05 22:50 UTC
        + Fix : t/30-threads.t will not be correctly skipped for perls with
                ithreads but without threads.pm. Thanks David Cantrell for
                providing access to a machine with such a perl.

        + Doc : The usual set of POD typos.
        + Fix : Ensure that we're on linux with $^O, as some smokers don't seem
                to apply anymore the rule of "if it's in the Linux:: namespace,
                then errors should be reported as FAILures only if we actually
                are on linux".
        + Tst : Tiny refinements.

        + Chg : Hash keys are now shared. This new implementation doesn't like
                5.9.3, but seems to be somehow ok with 5.9.5. If you're using
                5.9.3, either upgrade or keep with the precedent module version.

        + Chg : Declare LS_HAS_EXTENDED with newCONSTSUB.
