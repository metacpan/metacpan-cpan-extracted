Revision history for Perl extension Net::Packet.

Net::Frame::* modules on CPAN. This framework is obsolete.

3.28 Sun Feb 15 17:45:54 CET 2015
   - FEATURE: use $Env->noObsoleteWarning(1) to disable the obsolete warning

   - update: copyright notice

3.27 Mon Nov  9 19:19:57 CET 2009

   - NEW: now supports big-endian archs (IPv4 and IPv6 update)
   - bugfix: Frame: require VLAN

3.23 Thu Nov 23 23:47:10 CET 2006
   - examples: updates and bugfixes
   - tests: bugfix when test modules not available

3.22 Sat Nov 18 14:44:49 CET 2006
   - update: ETH: print() now displays length instead of type if 802.3 layer
   - new: IPv4: isProtocolIgmpv4() and NP_IPv4_PROTOCOL_IGMPv4
   - test: added Test::Pod::Coverage
   - test: added Test::Pod
   - pod: old undocumented methods are now documented

3.21 Wed Nov 15 19:52:43 CET 2006
   - NEW: added layers STP, OSPF (header only), IGMPv4 (v1 and v2),
          CDP::Address, CDP::TypeAddresses, CDP::TypeCapabilities,
          CDP::TypePortId, CDP::TypeSoftwareVersion
   - NEW: Dump now support PPP links
   - UPDATE: old PPP integrated into PPPoE, because this is PPP for PPPoE
             So, there is a new PPP implementation, which is now a layer 2
   - UPDATE: also, PPPLCP is now a layer 3
   - UPDATE: IPv4: hlen now defaults to 5, length now defaults to
             NP_IPv4_HDR_LEN
   - update: CDP: new attributes: typeAddresses, typePortId, typeCapabilities,
             typeSoftwareVersion
   - update: Packet: removed the END block that would clean $Env->dump,
             it is user responsibility to do that
   - bugfix: Frame: _getPadding()
   - bugfix: Dump: storing of received frames when doFrameReturnList is true
   - bugfix: Dump: .storable file removing in all cases
   - bugfix: Dump: isFather(), isSon()
   - bugfix: ARP: print()

3.20 Sun Nov 12 23:02:09 CET 2006
  - NEW: support for PPPoE, PPP, PPPLCP, LLC, and begin the work for CDP
  - NEW: Frame->new can now return an array ref of decoded frames, to handle 
         new layers, and such things as IPv6 within IPv4.
         See doFrameReturnList from Env.
         With this new scheme, the behaviour from unpacking VLAN or ICMPv4 
         has changed. Old behaviour remains the same, but if you set 
         doFrameReturnList to true (not by default), your programs will need 
         updating.
  - NEW: all layers: be able to create layers without having the need to 
                     build a full frame
  - new: Frame: print() and dump() methods, encapsulate attribute
  - new: Consts: new constants
  - new: Layer: isLayer2(), isLayer3(), isLayer4(), isLayer7(),
                getPayloadLength()
  - new: Utils: debugDeviceList()
  - new: Env: doFrameReturnList, noFramePadding, doIPv4Checksum,
              noFrameComputeChecksums, noFrameComputeLengths,
              doMemoryOptimizations
  - update: all layers: rewrite of print() methods
  - update: TCP: optimizations on recv() method
  - removed: Frame: noPadding attribute, moved to Env noFramePadding
  - removed: Frame: doChecksum attribute, moved to Env doIPv4Checksum
  - bugfix: Env: in getSubnet()
  - bugfix: Env: mapping between dnet interface and WinPcap interface should 
                 now work
  - bugfix: Env: no IPv6 under Windows for now
  - bugfix: ETH: in isTypeIp()
  - bugfix: Frame: do not use Dump and Desc if they do not exist
  - bugfix: Frame: getFilter() only when a Frame is competely filled
  - bugfix: IPv4: do not use l4 if it does not exist
  - bugfix: IPv6: do not use l4 if it does not exist

3.01 Sun Nov  5 16:27:50 CET 2006
  - NEW: ported to Windows ActivePerl
  - Utils: new subs: getGatewayIp, getGatewayMac, getIpMac
  - Env: new attributes: subnet, gatewayIp, gatewayMac
  - Desc: new attributes: gatewayIp, gatewayMac
  => gatewayIp is automatically set, but not gatewayMac, due to the 
     nature of the ARP lookup implementation.
  - DescL3: under Windows, the layer 2 (ethernet) is automatically built, 
            so using DescL3 is the same as using DescL3 under Unix/Linux 
            systems.

3.00 Sun Oct 29 15:31:06 CET 2006
  - Net::Packet::Dump: added keepTimestamp attribute to keep original pcap 
                       timestamp. Default is to not keep original and use our 
                       own timestamp.
  - bugfix: in Utils.pm, a redifined error is now removed
  - bugfix: in DescL4.pm, a redifined error is now removed
