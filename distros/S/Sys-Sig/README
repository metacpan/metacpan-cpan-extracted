NAME
      Sys::Sig -- return signal constants for this host

SYNOPSIS
  AS METHODS

      use Sys::Sig;

      my $TERM = Sys::Sig->TERM;

      kill $TERM, $pid;

            or

      my $Sig = new Sys::Sig;

      my $TERM = $Sig->TERM;
      ...

    NOTE: the signal name is not case sensitive. The following will work
    just as well for METHODS ONLY:

     my $TERM = $Sig->TeRm;

  AS FUNCTIONS

      use Sys::Sig qw(:all)
      use Sys::Sig qw(
            HUP
            TERM
            etc...
      );

    Use this syntax with care. Depending on the usage, perl may not
    interpret the bare word correctly.

      i.e. my $term = TERM;

    Better:

      my $term = &TERM;
      my $term = TERM();

    or, without the import

      my $term = &Sys::Sig::TERM;

    or, case insensitive for full package function call

      my $term = &Sys::Sig::term;
      my $term = Sys::Sig::term();

  PRINT SIGNALS VALUES

    Print an alphabetical list of all signals to the FILEHANDLE or STDOUT if
    no filehandle is specified.

      Sys::Sig::print(*FILEHANDLE);

    Print a numeric sorted list of all signals to the FILEHANDLE or STDOUT
    if no filehandle is specified.

      Sys::Sig::printN(*FILEHANDLE);
