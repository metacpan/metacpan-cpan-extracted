  [Maintenance release]
  - Fix build on cygwin (Thanks Reini Urban). Closes #31913.

1.02  2007-02-07
  [Maintenance release]
  - Probe for a system ffcall instead of bundling its sources.
  - For Windows, bundle prebuilt ffcall-1.10 libs. (Works with
    Strawberry Perl and MSVC-built perls, including ActivePerl.)

1.01  Thu Jun 19 22:04:59 2003
  [Installation improvements]
  - FFI now uses the _installed_ ffcall libraries and headers,
    rather than those in the ./ffcall directory.
  - Linux installation now works.
  - Fixed two warnings in FFI.xs.
  - Replaced the old ./ffcall contents with the current ffcall-1.8.
  - t/basic.t now uses Test, and win32.t was tweaked.  Hopefully the
    automated module testers will now be happier.

1.00  Tue Oct 31 14:47:45 2000
  - Tidied up
  - Implemented workaround for DynaLoader problems on ActiveState
    binary build
