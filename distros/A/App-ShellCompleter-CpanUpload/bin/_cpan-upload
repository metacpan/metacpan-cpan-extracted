=head1 NAME

_cpan-upload - Shell completer for cpan-upload

=head1 VERSION

This document describes version 0.05 of Getopt::Long::Patch::DumpAndExit (from Perl distribution App-ShellCompleter-CpanUpload), released on 2015-09-27.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

To install, install this module and then in your bash (and/or bash startup
file):

 complete -C _cpan-upload cpan-upload

or, you can use L<shcompgen> to do that for you automatically.

Now L<cpan-upload> has bash completion:

 % cpan-upload <tab>
 % cpan-upload --ig<tab>

=head1 COMPLETION

This script has shell tab completion capability with support for several
shells.

=head2 bash

To activate bash completion for this script, put:

 complete -C _cpan-upload _cpan-upload

in your bash startup (e.g. C<~/.bashrc>). Your next shell session will then
recognize tab completion for the command. Or, you can also directly execute the
line above in your shell to activate immediately.

It is recommended, however, that you install L<shcompgen> which allows you to
activate completion scripts for several kinds of scripts on multiple shells.
Some CPAN distributions (those that are built with
L<Dist::Zilla::Plugin::GenShellCompletion>) will even automatically enable shell
completion for their included scripts (using C<shcompgen>) at installation time,
so you can immadiately have tab completion.

=head2 tcsh

To activate tcsh completion for this script, put:

 complete _cpan-upload 'p/*/`_cpan-upload`/'

in your tcsh startup (e.g. C<~/.tcshrc>). Your next shell session will then
recognize tab completion for the command. Or, you can also directly execute the
line above in your shell to activate immediately.

It is also recommended to install C<shcompgen> (see above).

=head2 other shells

For fish and zsh, install C<shcompgen> as described above.
