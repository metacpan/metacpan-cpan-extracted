Template-Plugin-WikiFormat
==========================

DESCRIPTION

This is a plugin used for wiki rendering inside Template Toolkit.

Parameters may be passed in through the USE directive, e.g. 

  [% USE WikiFormat prefix = "http://www.mysite.com/?page=" %]

This provides the 4 options supported by L<Text::WikiFormat>, i.e.
C<prefix, extended, implicit_links, absolute_links>, and the special option 
global_replace, which takes an array of arrays of from and to strings. The 
output from Text::WikiFormat is post processed by replacing each from regexp 
with the to regexp. Anything else passed in is interpreted as a tag (see the 
Gory Details section).
