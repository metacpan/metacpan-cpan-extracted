# Gibbs -- a Package for Sequence Motif Discovery using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) Sampling

**Author**: MH Seabolt (Github: @hseabolt)

This package creates a Perl object class representing a Gibbs sampler tailored for MCMC sampling of "mutually similar" motifs from string data.
While written with biological sequences in mind, this package is also suitable for motif-finding from generic strings using any alphabet.

The `Gibbs` package is written in base Perl (v5.32.1).

## Installation Instructions

The code can be obtained/installed in two ways:

1. Install from Github:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/hseabolt/Gibbs.git
cd Gibbs
```

2. Install from `CPAN`
```bash
# Using cpanm
cpanm gibbs

# Using the CPAN shell
perl -MCPAN -e shell
install gibbs
```

3. Install using `Conda` (Bioconda)
```bash
conda install -c bioconda gibbs
```

If installing from Github, you can globally install the `Gibbs.pm` package by copying this file to a location that is visible to your `PATH` or Perl's `@INC` variables.

## Running Instructions

An example script comes packaged with the Github version of this code which illustrates the basic idea of how to create and use the Gibbs object class for motif sampling.
and can be plugged into any scripts running Perl.
