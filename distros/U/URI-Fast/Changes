-bugfix: escape_tree and unescape_tree die when called with non-reference
 argument
-workaround: an older release had a versioned URI::Fast::IRI, requiring that it
 remains versioned to keep the cpan indexer happy; this change works around
 that by linking it to $URI::Fast::VERSION.
-bugfix: path([]) caused infinite loop, because why would av_top_index return 0
 for an empty array anyway?
