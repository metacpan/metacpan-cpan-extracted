NAME
    Test2::Tools::Pod -- check that POD syntax is valid

SYNOPSIS
        use Test2::V0;
        use Test2::Tools::Pod;

        # Check a single file
        pod_ok 'lib/Module.pm';

        # Check all modules in distribution
        all_pod_ok;

        done_testing;

DESCRIPTION
    "Test2::Tools::Pod" performs simple POD syntax checks on one or more
    Perl source files, reporting any parsing errors as test failures. It is
    built directly on top of Test2::API, making it suitable for projects
    that use modern Test2-based tooling.

    Parsing and validation are performed using Pod::Simple. Each file is
    read, parsed, and reported as a separate test.

    The tool is suitable for author tests, continuous integration, or any
    situation where POD syntax correctness is required without additional
    diagnostics or formatting checks.

SUBROUTINES
  pod_ok
        sub pod_ok ( $file, $name = undef )

    Parses the given file and runs a single test asserting that its POD
    syntax is valid. The optional $name argument specifies the test name. If
    omitted, the default name is "POD syntax ok for $file".

    If no POD content is found in the file, the test is skipped.

    Returns "true" if the syntax is OK, "false" otherwise. If no POD was
    found and the test was skipped, returns undef;

  all_pod_ok
        sub all_pod_ok ( @locations )

    Recursively searches for Perl files containing POD under @locations,
    which may include both directories and files. If no locations are
    provided, it searches the blib directory if it exists, or otherwise lib.

    Files tested include those with extensions .pl, .pm, .pod, .psgi, and
    .t, as well as any file that begins with a Perl shebang line.

    When scanning directories, "all_pod_ok" automatically skips
    version-control directories for Git and Mercurial. This list is stored
    in %Test2::Tools::Pod::Ignore, which you may modify before calling
    "all_pod_ok" to adjust which directories are ignored.

    Returns the number of files tested.
