0.202   2020-01-28  Released-By: PERLANCAR; Urgency: medium

        - No longer mark the 'message' property as experimental.

        - Mention that completion array structure or word entry is a
          DefHash.

        - Add explanation about 'path_sep' property (moved from
          Complete::Bash).

        - Note that implementations that want to observe additional information
          should do it in x.NAME.WHATEVER, as per DefHash.

        [Removed]

        - Remove property 'type' from the specification; implementation
          modules can observe their own properties.

        - Remove property 'esc_mode' to avoid abstraction leak as this is
          implementation detail.


0.201   2019-06-26  Released-By: PERLANCAR

        - Introduce 'message' (experimental).


0.200   2018-09-26  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- Specify is_partial.


0.19    2015-12-17  Released-By: PERLANCAR; Urgency: low

	- No spec changes.

	- Update documentation.


0.18    2015-11-29  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- Updates (Complete::Setting has been merged to Complete::Common,
	  behavior/options like ci/fuzzy/etc now should not be a
	  per-function argument but are global settings in
	  Complete::Common).


0.17    2015-11-28  Released-By: PERLANCAR

        - Split Complete::Setting to Complete-Common so this distribution is now
          pure specification.


0.16    2015-09-16  Released-By: PERLANCAR

        - [Removed] Remove setting OPT_EXP_IM_PATH_MAX_LEN.


0.15    2015-09-12  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- Because Complete::Path has tweaked the way it does intermediate
	  path expansion, we might not need OPT_EXP_IM_PATH_MAX_LEN
	  anymore, for now I first test increasing this value first from 2
	  to 6, later if things work out I might remove this option.


0.14    2015-09-12  Released-By: PERLANCAR

        - Setting: Introduce OPT_FUZZY for fuzzy matching.


0.13    2015-09-09  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- [Incompatible change] Move settings from Complete to
          Complete::Settings, to allow Complete to become purely a spec module.


0.12    2015-03-04  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- Rename escmode to esc_mode for more consistent word separating
	  style.


0.11    2015-01-09  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- Add experimental option: $OPT_DIG_LEAF.


0.10    2014-12-27  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- No functional changes.

	- Derp, forgot to declare $OPT_EXP_IM_PATH_MAX_LEN.


0.08    2014-12-27  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- Introduce setting: OPT_EXP_IM_PATH_MAX_LEN (defaults to 2) to
	  work around potential annoyance described earlier, set
	  OPT_EXP_IM_PATH default back to on.


0.07    2014-12-25  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- Set default of OPT_EXP_IM_PATH to 0 due to potential annoying
	  behavior in some cases.
