koha-claim - Claim overdues each day, grouping same overdues

=head1 VERSION

version 0.071

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  koha-claim
  koha-claim --doit
  koha-claim --doit --to myself@tamil.fr

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This script creates claim notifications to borrowers for their overdues based
on claim rules.  Notification are inserted into Koha standard notification
queue (message_queue table). They have then to be processed by
process_message_queue.pl script. The notifications group overdues. So for
example, if a borrower has 3 overdues, 1 for 10 days and 2 for 20 days, and if
you have 2 rules, one for 10 days and another one for 20 days, 2 notifications
(not 3, one for each overdue) will be prepared: the 20 days notification will
group the 2 20 days overdues.

Rules are found in C<ClaimRules> Koha system preference.

  # Branch itype days action notice
  # action => 1=email, 2=debarre
  *    *   15  1   REL1
  MAIN *   25  1   REL1
  *    BK  40  1   REL1
  *    *   55  1   REL1
  *    *   75  1   REL1
  *    *   85  1   REL4
  *    *   90  1   REL1

This script MUST be run every day. It matches overdues on a exact number of
days of overdue.

Without C<--doit> parameter, the notifications are sent to the terminal (stdout)
rather than to the notification queue.

The notifications are entered in Koha in Tools > Notifications. Items
information must be enclosed into <items> </items> tag. For example:

  Library <<branches.branchname>>
  <<branches.branchaddress1>>
  <<branches.branchzip>> <<branches.branchcity>>
  <<branches.branchphone>>
  
  Miss, Madam, Sir,
  
  This is overdue:
  
  <items>
    Title:       <<biblio.title>>
    Author:      <<biblio.author>>
    Call Number: <<items.itemcallnumber>>
    Borrowed at: <<item_branch>>
    Due date:    <<issues.date_due>>
    Type:        <<itemtypes.description>>
  </items>
