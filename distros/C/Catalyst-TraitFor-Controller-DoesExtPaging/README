DESCRIPTION
    This module is mostly for sending DBIx::Class paginated data to ExtJS
    based javascript code.

METHODS
  ext_paginate
      my $resultset = $self->model('DB::Foo');
      my $results   = $self->paginate($resultset);
      my $json      = $self->ext_paginate($resultset);
      my $json_str  = to_json($json);

   Description
    Returns a structure like the following from the ResultSet:

      {
         data  => \@results,
         total => $count_before_pagination
      }

   Valid arguments are:
      rs      - paginated ResultSet to get the data from
      coderef - any valid scalar that can be called on the result object

  ext_parcel
      my $items    = [qw{foo bar baz}];
      my $total    = 7;
      my $json     = $self->ext_parcel($data, $total);
      my $json_str = to_json($json);

   Description
    Returns a structure like the following:

      {
         data  => [@{$items}],
         total => $total || scalar @{$items}
      }

   Valid arguments are:
      list  - a list of anything you want to be in the data structure
      total - whatever you want to say the total is.  Defaults to size of
              the list passed in.

CONFIG VARIABLES
    root
      Sets the name of the root for the data structure. Defaults to data.

    total_property
      Sets the name for the total property for the data structure. Defaults
      to total.
