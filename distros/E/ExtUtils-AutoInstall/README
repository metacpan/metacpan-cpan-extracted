This is the README file for ExtUtils::AutoInstall, a module to
let Makefile.PL automatically install dependencies via CPAN or
CPANPLUS.

= Features

* Letting the user enable/disable optional dependencies.
* Support sane defaults by probing for the machine's capability.
* If not inside a cpan shell, use CPAN.pm to install dependencies.
* Enable/disable the associated tests automatically.
* Supply UNINST=1 when it is safe and possibly needed.
* Checks MANIFEST to avoid unnecessary grepping of EXE_FILES.
* Utilizes CPANPLUS and/or Sort::Versions where feasible.
* Offers check-only and skip-all Makefile.PL targets.
* Offers check-only and install-only Makefile targets.
* Take advantage of the 'sudo' command where available.

= Installation

ExtUtils::AutoInstall uses the standard perl module install process:

    cpansign -v         # optional; see SIGNATURE for details
    perl Makefile.PL
    make                # or 'nmake' on Win32
    make test
    make install
