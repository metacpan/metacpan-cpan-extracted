NAME
    Thrust - Perl bindings to the Thrust cross-platform application
    framework

SYNOPSIS
        use Thrust;

        my $t = Thrust->new;

        my $w = $t->window(
                  root_url => 'data:text/html,Hello World!', ## or file://, https://, etc
                  title => 'My App',
                  size => { width => 800, height => 600 },
                )->show;

        $t->run; ## enter event loop

DESCRIPTION
    Thrust is a chromium-based cross-platform and cross-language application
    framework. It allows you to create "native"-like applications using
    HTML/CSS for the interface and (of course) perl for the glue code to
    filesystems, DBs, networking, libraries, and everything else perl is
    great at.

    This is the easiest way to install perl-thrust:

        curl -sL https://raw.github.com/miyagawa/cpanminus/master/cpanm | sudo perl - Thrust

    Read more about Thrust at its official website
    <https://github.com/breach/thrust>. There are bindings for many other
    languages such as node.js, go, and python.

    Like the bindings for other languages, installing the perl module will
    download a zip file from github which contains the "thrust_shell"
    binary. It will extract this into the perl distribution's private share
    directory.

    Unlike the bindings for other languages, in the perl ones there are no
    definitions for individual thrust methods. Instead, an AUTOLOAD is used
    to automatically "forward" all perl method calls (and their JSON encoded
    arguments) to the thrust shell. This has the advantage that there is
    generally no need to do anything to the perl bindings when new
    methods/parameters are added to the thrust shell. However, it has the
    disadvantage that sometimes the API is less convenient. For instance,
    instead of positional arguments in (for example) the "move" method, you
    must use the named "x" and "y" parameters.

    Like the bindings in other languages, methods can be invoked on a window
    object even before the window is created. The methods will be queued up
    and invoked in order once the window is ready. After that point, all
    messages are delivered to the window asynchronously. For example, here
    is a one-liner command to open a maximized window with the dev tools
    console expanded:

        $ perl -MThrust -e 'Thrust->window->show->maximize->open_devtools->run'

    To understand how the above works, consider that the perl bindings also
    support some one-liner shortcuts such as method chaining, an implicit
    "Thrust" context created by "window", and a "run" method on the window.

ASYNC PROGRAMMING
    Like browser programming itself, programming the perl side of a Thrust
    application is done asynchronously. The Thrust package depends on
    AnyEvent for this purpose so you can use whichever event loop you
    prefer. See the AnyEvent documentation for details on asynchronous
    programming.

    The "run" methods of the Thrust context/window objects simply wait on a
    condition variable that will never be signalled (well you can if you
    want to, it's in "$t->{cv}") in order to enter the event loop and "sleep
    forever". "run" is mostly there so you don't need to type "use AnyEvent;
    AE::cv->recv" in simple scripts/examples.

    Almost all methods on the window object can optionally take a callback
    argument that will be called once the operation has been completed. For
    example:

        $w->maximize(sub { say "window has been maximized" });

    If present, the callback must be the final argument. For methods that
    require parameters, the parameters must be in a hash-ref preceeding the
    (optional) callback:

        $w->resize({ width => 100, height => 100 },
                   sub { say "window has been resized" });

EVENT HANDLERS
    Window objects have an "on" method which allows you to append a callback
    to be invoked when a particular event is triggered.

    For example, normally closing a window will not cause the termination of
    your perl program. Instead, the "closed" event will be triggered. By
    default nothing is listening for this event so it is discarded. If you
    want you can make the closing of one or more windows terminate your perl
    program as well (which in turn kills all the other windows this process
    has started):

        $window->on(closed => sub { exit });

    If you ever wish to remove handlers for an event, window objects also
    have a "clear" method:

        $window->clear('closed');

    See the thrust API docs for information on the potential events and
    actions. To snoop on the event traffic to and from the thrust shell, set
    the environment variable "THRUST_DEBUG" to 1 or higher. Set it to 2 or
    higher to also see the standard error debugging output from the
    "thrust_shell" process. Here is a simple example of the traffic when you
    create and show a window:

        $ THRUST_DEBUG=1 perl -MThrust -e 'Thrust->new->window->show->run'

        }

                       "_id" : 11,
                       "_result" : {}
                    }
                
                
                    <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< Message from thrust shell
                    {
                       "_action" : "event",
                       "_event" : {},
                       "_id" : 1,
                       "_target" : 1,
                       "_type" : "focus"
                    }

REMOTE EVENTS
    One of the most useful features of thrust is its support for
    bi-directional messaging between your application and the browser over
    pipes connecting to the thrust shell's stdin/stdout. Without this
    support we would need to allocate some kind of network port or unix
    socket file and start something like an AJAX or websocket server.

    In order for the browser to send a message to your perl code, it should
    execute something like the following javascript code:

        THRUST.remote.send({ foo: 'bar' }); // send message to perl

    On the perl side, you will need to install an event handler for the
    "remote" event by calling the "on" method of a window object:

        $w->on('remote', sub {
            my $msg = $_[0]->{message};

            print $msg->{foo}; # prints bar
        });

    In order to send a message from perl to the browser, call the "remote"
    method on a window object:

        $w->remote({ message => { foo => 'bar' } });

    On the javascript side, you will need to install a handler like so:

        THRUST.remote.listen(function(msg) {
            console.log(msg['foo']); // prints bar
        });

    IMPORTANT NOTE: Before applications can send messages from perl to
    javascript, the "THRUST.remote.listen" function must have been called.
    If you try to send a message before this, it is likely that the message
    will be delivered to the browser before the handler has been installed
    so your message will be lost. Applications should make javascript send a
    message indicating that the communication channel is ready to indicate
    to the perl component that it can begin sending messages to the browser.

TESTS
    Currently this software has two tests, "load.t" that verifies Thrust is
    installed and "remote.t" which starts and shows the thrust shell, then
    proceeds to confirm bi-directional transfer of messages between
    javascript and perl. Maybe the test-suite shouldn't show a window by
    default?

BUGS
    Haha this software is so beta. I've only tested this so far on 64-bit
    linux so the cross-platform claim is theoretical.

    Only the window object is currently exposed. Eventually the window code
    should be refactored into a base class so that session and menu can be
    implemented as well (as done in the node.js bindings).

    Add a test that verifies "thrust_shell" is killed when your program
    exits or is killed.

    The perl bindings don't report errors from the thrust shell properly to
    your code yet. Eventually I think they should use Callback::Frame.

    Actually "thrust_shell" doesn't have great error checking itself. Any
    error messages like the following probably indicate that you passed in
    some malformed argument and terminated the thrust_shell abnormally:

        AnyEvent::Handle uncaught error: Broken pipe at /usr/local/lib/perl/5.18.2/AnyEvent/Loop.pm line 248.

    The fact that "thrust_shell" binaries are duplicated for every language
    binding is good and bad: depending on how backwards compatible
    everything is, duplication may be necessary because of protocol changes.
    It's bad in that you can't immediately apply bug-fixes to all copies of
    "thrust_shell" on your system.
