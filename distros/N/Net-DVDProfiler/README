Net/DVDProfiler version 0.03
==================================

This module is designed to scrape a designated user's DVD Profiler profile and 
grab all the associated movie UPC symbols. This can be quickly tied in with the 
Net::Amazon::DVD2IMDB module to get the resulting IMDB movie information.
