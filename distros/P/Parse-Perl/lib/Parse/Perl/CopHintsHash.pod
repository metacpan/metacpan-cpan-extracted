=head1 NAME

Parse::Perl::CopHintsHash - reified cop_hints_hash structure

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a class used internally by L<Parse::Perl> to represent part of
a lexical environment.  It is not meant to be touched by users directly.
See L<Parse::Perl::Environment> for the class that represents the whole
lexical environment.

An object of this class is a Perl-manipulable handle onto a C<struct
refcounted_he>, which is the structure that Perl (from version 5.9.4
onwards) uses to store a runtime-accessible form of the compile-time
C<%^H> lexical hints hash.  The structures are reference-counted, but
because they are not in the C<SV> format they can't directly participate
in the usual reference counting of Perl objects.  This class is a shim
layer to allow the structures to be referenced from Perl objects in a
way that propagates reference counting semantics.

The C<refcounted_he> structure is only accessible from C code.  This class
does not provide any Perl-level interface to its content.

On versions of Perl that don't have C<struct refcounted_he>, this class
still exists, but represents nothing and should never be encountered.
