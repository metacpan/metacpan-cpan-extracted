DESCRIPTION

    A pure Perl IPv6 address manipulation library. Emphasis on manipulation
    of prefixes and addresses. Very easy to understand and modify. The
    internal representation of an IPv6::Address is a blessed hash with two
    keys, a prefix length (0-128 obviously) and a 128-bit string. A
    multitude of methods to do various tasks is provided.

 Methods

    new( ipv6_string )

      Takes a string representation of an IPv6 address and creates a
      corresponding IPv6::Address object.

    raw_new( bitstr, length )

      Creates a new IPv6::Address out of a bitstring and a prefix length.
      The bitstring must be binary, please do not use a '0' or '1'
      character string.

    get_bitstr

      Returns the bitstr of the object.

    get_prefixlen

      Returns the prefix length of the address.

    get_mask_bitstr(length)

      Returns a 128-bit string with the first prefix-length bits equal to
      1, rest equal to 0. Essentially takes the prefix length of the object
      and returns a corresponding bit mask.

    get_masked_address_bitstr

      Returns the bitstring, after zeroing out all the bits after the
      prefix length. Essentially applies the prefix mask to the address.

    generate_bitstr( number )

      Not a method, returns 128-bit string, first n-items are 1, rest is 0.

    bitstr_and( bitstr1 , bitstr2 )

      Not a method, AND's two bitstrings, returns result.

    bitstr_or( bitstr1 , bitstr2)

      Not a method, OR's two bitstrings, returns result.

    bitstr_not( bitstr )

      Not a method, inverts a bitstring.

    from_str( string_bitstring )

      Not a method, takes a string of characters 0 or 1, returns
      corresponding binary bitstring. Please do not use more than 128
      characters, rest will be ignored.

    to_str( bitstring )

      Not a method, takes a binary bitstring, returns a string composed of
      0's and 1's. Please supply bitstrings of max. 128 bits, rest of the
      bits will be ignored.

    contains( other_address )

      This method takes an argument which is either an IPv6::Address or a
      plain string that can be promoted to a valid IPv6::Address, and tests
      whether the object contains it. Obviously returns true or false.

    addr_string

      Returns the address part of the IPv6::Address. Using the option
      ipv4=>1 like

       $a->addr_string(ipv4=>1) 

      will make the last 32-bits appear as an IPv4 address. Also, using
      nocompress=>1 like

       $a->addr_string( nocompress => 1 ) 

      will prevent the string from containing a '::' part. So it will be 8
      parts separated by ':' colons.

    string

      Returns the full IPv6 address, with the prefix in its end.

    to_string

      Used internally by the overload module.

    split( exponent , target_length )

      Splits the address to the order of two of the number given as first
      argument. Example: if argument is 3, 2^3=8, address is split into 8
      parts. The final parts have prefix length equal to the target_length
      specified in the second argument.

    apply_mask

      Applies the prefix length mask to the address. Does not return
      anything. Works on $self. WARNING:This will alter the object.

    first_address

      Returns the first address of the prefix that is represented by the
      object. E.g. consider 2001:648:2000::1234/64. First address will be
      2001:648:2000::/64.

    last_address

      Returns the last address of the prefix that is represented by the
      object. E.g. consider 2001:648:2000::1234/64. Last address will be
      2001:648:2000::ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff/64.

    is_unspecified , is_loopback , is_multicast

      Returns true or false depending on whether the address falls into the
      corresponding category stated by the method name. E.g.

       IPv6::Address->new('::1')->is_loopback # returns true

    ipv4_to_binarray

      Not a method, takes an IPv4 address, returns a character string
      consisting of 32 characters that are 0 or 1. Used internally, not too
      useful for the end user.

    enumerate_with_IPv4( ipv4, mask )

      Takes an IPv4 address and uses a part of it to enumerate inside the
      Ipv6 prefix of the object. E.g.

       IPv6::Address->new('2001:648:2001::/48')->enumerate_with_IPv4('0.0.0.1',0x0000ffff) #will yield 2001:648::2001:0001::/64

      The return value will be a new IPv6::Address object, so the original
      object remains intact. The part that will be used as an offset is
      extracted from the ipv4 by using the mask.

    enumerate_with_offset( offset, desired_length )

      Takes a non-negative integer offset and returns a prefix whose
      relative position inside the object is defined by the offset. The
      prefix length of the result is defined by the second argument. E.g.

       IPv6::Address->new('2001:648:2000::/48')->enumerate_with_offset( 5 , 64 ) #2001:648:2000:4::/64

    increment( offset )

      Increments the IPv6::Address object by offset. Offsets larger than
      2^32-1 are not acceptable. This method is probably not too useful,
      but is provided for completeness.

    nxx_parts(unpack_format)

      Takes the bitstring of the address and unpacks it using the first
      argument. Internal use mostly.

    n16_parts

      Splits the address into an 8-item array of unsigned short integers.
      Network byte order is implied, a short integer is 16-bits long.

    n16_parts

      Splits the address into an 4-item array of unsigned long integers.
      Network byte order is implied, a long integer is 32-bits long.

    n_cmp( a , b )

      Takes two 128-bit bitstr arguments, compares them and returns the
      result as -1, 0 or 1. The semantics are the same as that of the
      spaceship operator <=>.

      This method will overload the <=> operator for IPv6::Address objects,
      so comparing IPv6::Address objects like they were integers produces
      the correct results.

    n_sort( array )

      Sorts an array of bitstrs using the n_cmp function.

    radius_string

      Returns a string suitable to be returned as an IPv6 Radius AV-pair.
      See RFC 3162 for an explanation of the format.
