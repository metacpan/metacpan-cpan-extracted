Revision history for Socket-GetAddrInfo

0.22    CHANGES:
         * Move most exports into @EXPORT_OK
         * Provide exception-throwing version of API in
           Socket::GetAddrInfo::Strict
         * Wrap lots more flag constants
            + AI_IDN, AI_V4MAPPED, AI_ALL, AI_ADDRCONFIG
            + NI_IDN, NI_NOFQDN
            + EAI_SYSTEM, EAI_BADHINTS, EAI_PROTOCOL
         * Implement NIx_NOHOST and NIx_NOSERV; flags to getnameinfo to
           request only one of host or service name
         * No longer supports API import tags
         * Docs improvements - added some code examples

0.21    BUGFIXES:
         * Exporter 5.57 is required - this has shipped with perl since 5.8.3,
           but now explicitly declared for 5.6.2
         * getservbyport() needs a protocol name on 5.6.2

0.20    CHANGES:
         * Added bin/getaddrinfo and bin/getnameinfo script (replaces previous
           examples/gai.pl)
         * Split Socket6api into its own module
         * Emulate AI_NUMERICSERV in PP emulation since most OSes in practice
           support it, even though RFC 2553 doesn't define it
         * Provide Exporter tags for named constants
         * Don't even attempt to build XS code if no C compiler is available
         * Try to use core's Socket::getaddrinfo if it exists; as it does on
           Socket 1.93 (perl 5.13.9).
         * Avoid Test::Exception and Test::Warn as they're non-core and pull
           in Sub::UpLevel
         * Use ExtUtils::CChecker 0.06's ability to write a config.h rather
           than using C commandline -DFOO that might not be portable
         * Moved legacy resolver emulation code into its own PP.pm for code
           neatness

        BUGFIXES:
         * Bugfix for non-C99 compilers - avoid C99-style struct initialiser
         * Bugfix for threaded perls - aTHX/pTHX in err_to_SV()
         * More MSWin32 fixes [rurban]
         * Use ppport.h

0.19    BUGFIXES:
         * Can't store &PL_sv_undef in an HV; store newSV(0) instead
         * Handle magic in getaddrinfo() args [chansen]
         * Win32 build fixes [chansen]

0.18    BUGFIXES:
         * Fix plain number passing for getaddrinfo()'s service on perl
           versions <5.10.0

0.17    BUGFIXES:
         * Fix 'protocol' hint to getaddrinfo()

0.16    CHANGES:
         * Accept undef as absent host/service name, as well as ""

        BUGFIXES:
         * Need -lsocket on some OSes; hunt it using ExtUtils::CChecker

0.15    CHANGES:
         * Use XSLoader instead of DynaLoader
         * import Exporter::import instead of @ISAing it
         * Use ExtUtils::CChecker for build checking

0.14    BUGFIXES:
         * Don't leak memory on getnameinfo() failures
         * Avoid possible sockaddr alignment errors by allocating/copying a
           new buffer
         (thanks to Zefram)

0.13    CHANGES:
         * Don't warn if only importing symbolic constants; test this
         * Added Test::Pod testing
         * Docs neatening in L<> links

0.12    CHANGES:
         * Added 'use warnings'
         * Added 'gai.pl' example

0.11    CHANGES:
         * Pass "socktype => SOCK_STREAM" hint in example
         * Use "return 1" rather than "exit(1)" in C code to avoid needing
           <unistd.h>; may improve builds on non-UNIX platforms

        BUGFIXES:
         * Declare ExtUtils::CBuilder as a configure_requires dependency, and
           fail gracefully if it still isn't installed when Build.PL runs

0.10    BUGFIXES:
         * Fixed a bug in getnameinfo() when handling IPv6 addresses, where
           a buffer overrun causes at least a failure from libc, but has the
           potential to cause a stack corruption or segfault.

0.09    CHANGES:
         * Conditionally skip the tests for missing hostnames if the legacy
           resolver finds an address anyway. This may mitigate test FAILs on
           smoke test machines with wildcard DNS servers.

0.08    CHANGES:
         * Declare as release

0.08_7  CHANGES:
         * Make sure to sv_2mortal() returned SV*s in XS code

        BUGFIXES:
         * Minor changes to test scripts that should reduce cornercase FAILs,
           or at least help debug them if they occur

0.08_6  BUGFIXES:
         * Set 'sa_len' member of sockaddr structure if platform needs it

0.08_5  BUGFIXES:
         * Better comparison of sockaddr returns - unpack and test components
           to avoid errors on platforms that use sin_len, since Socket doesn't
         * Use XSRETURN() in XS functions to ensure stack is correct height
         * Better diagnostic if $err tests fail - convert number to symbolic
           constant

0.08_4  BUGFIXES:
         * Define constants in XS code wrapped in #ifdef tests, to ensure
           only ones that the platform defines are attempted.
         * Print whether PP or XS implementation are being used in the
           t/00use.t file

0.08_3  BUGFIXES:
         * Use ExtUtils::CBuilder to compile the test .c file in the
           Configure() stage, to make it (hopefully) more portable
         * Some OSes return $err==0 but no results for invalid names - make
           sure the test script can cope.

0.08_2  BUGFIXES:
         * Declare variables in "PREINIT" XS section, not "INIT"; keeps
           non-C99 compilers happy
         * Skip tests that require internet connectivity unless the tester
           declares it possible
         * Declare test counts upfront in testing scripts
         * Renamed XS functions 'getaddrinfo' and 'getnameinfo'; no need to
           prefix with 'real_'
         * Folded Configure.pl inline into Build.PL, in case it has to make
           further decisions

0.08_1  CHANGES:
         * Complete rewrite to XS+PP emulation system. No longer uses Socket6
           on account of API and error reporting issues.
         * Provided two styles of API at import time (:newapi and :Socket6api)
           to allow caller to choose between RFC2553-like or Socket6 styles

0.07    BUGFIXES:
         * Ensure that emulated getaddrinfo() copes with family=AF_UNSPEC (0)

0.06    BUGFIXES:
         * Avoid (harmless) "Constant subroutine .. redefined" warnings if
           'use'd multiple times, when Socket6 is not available.

0.05    CHANGES:
         * Reworded DESCRIPTION section of documentation
         * Fixed some bugs in the SYNOPSIS example

0.04    BUGFIXES:
         * Declare dependency on Test::Exception
         * Fixed skip count in test in 01getaddrinfo-socket6.t

0.03    CHANGES:
         * Changed getnameinfo() to avoid needing sockaddr_family(), which
           avoids a version check, which means it works on perl 5.6.1

0.02    BUGFIXES:
         * Declare required version of Socket.pm sufficient to have
           sockaddr_family()

0.01    First version, released on an unsuspecting world.
