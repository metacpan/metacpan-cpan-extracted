NAME
    App::Stash - persistent application data storage

SYNOPSIS
        use App::Stash;
        $stash = App::Stash->new({application => "test"});
        $stash->data->{'test'} = 1;
        $stash->d->{'test'} = 1;

    after new run:

        use App::Stash;
        $s=App::Stash->new({application => "test"});
        print $s->data->{'test'}, "\n";
        print $s->dao->test, "\n";

WARNING
    experimental, use on your own risk :-)

DESCRIPTION
    The purpose of the module is to transparently save stash data
    (structure) across application (script) execution. The save is done in
    DESTROY method. This has certain limitations. Basically make sure you
    never store object in the data as this one may get destroyed before
    App::Stash object does.

    The module+style is inspired by App::Cache. Unlike App::Cache it uses
    JSON::Util for storage and not Storable. The stash is saved to
    $HOME/.app-name/stash.json. It is in the "pretty" format so it should be
    easy to read and edit. I wanted to go with Storable but using it in
    DESTROY method causes `Segmentation fault' on my Perl.

    Warn: no file locking in place, use Proc::PID::File or similar to have
    just one instance of program running or send a wish list bug report and
    wait for implementation of stash file locking. :)

PROPERTIES
        application
        directory
        stash_filename

    See App::Cache for a description of `application' and `directory'.
    `stash_filename' is the full path to the file where stash data will be
    stored. All three are optional.

METHODS
  new()
    Object constructor.

  d
    Shortcut for data.

  data
    Returns reference to the stash data.

  dao()
    Returns data passed to Data::AsObject. So basically the data structure
    becomes an object. See Data::AsObject for details.

    Note: Data::AsObject is not compile time dependency. It will be used if
    installed. If not the exception will be thrown only when calling dao. So
    if you plan to use it, make it a dependency of your module/program.

  clear
    Will delete stash data and remove the file with the stash data from the
    disk.

  load
    Load stash data from disk. Called automatically by first call to data.
    Can be used to revert current stash data to the state before current
    execution.

  save
    Save stash data to disk - $HOME/.app-name/stash.json. Called
    automatically via DESTROY method when App::Stash object is going to be
    destroyed.

    Will throw an exception if the file save fails.

  DESTROY
    Calls save and prints warning if it fails.
