To-Do List:

1. Enforce GDB's inherent limits
2. define text based dump format which could be used to check databases
   into a revision control system such as RCS or CVS.
   This can be used as a form of backup...
3. Code reorganisation:
   DBgui should be in it's own module

Things left to be done for later:


  additional UNIMPLEMENTED data manipulation methods:
    $db->DELETE ($num)                  delete given data record
    $db->INSERT ($num)                  insert a new object at index
    $db2= $db1->dupDB ()                copy the database
    $db->clearDB ()                     delete data and note elements
    $db->delete ($num)                  delete a data record including note

retrieve DB format
$fmt->{$Fieldname}=
{
  'type'        => type code,
  'min_size'    => minimum size to display, e.g. DATE == 10 as in 1998-01-11
  'max_size'    => maximum size to display
};

formatted print list output somehow

-----
possible import/export application which are not too specific:
+ synchronization of a Phone Database with ELM/Pine/Netscape address books
+ Netscape bookmarks
