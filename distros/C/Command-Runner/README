NAME

    Command::Runner - run external commands and Perl code refs

SYNOPSIS

      use Command::Runner;
    
      my $cmd = Command::Runner->new(
        command => ['ls', '-al'],
        timeout => 10,
        on => {
          stdout => sub { warn "out: $_[0]\n" },
          stderr => sub { warn "err: $_[0]\n" },
        },
      );
      my $res = $cmd->run;
    
      # you can also use method chains
      my $res = Command::Runner->new
        ->command(sub { warn 1; print 2 })
        ->redirect(1)
        ->on(stdout => sub { warn "merged: $_[0]" })
        ->run;

DESCRIPTION

    Command::Runner runs external commands and Perl code refs

METHODS

 new

    A constructor, which takes:

    command

      arrays of external commands, strings of external programs, or Perl
      code refs

      CAUTION! Currently this module does NOTHING for quoting. YOU are
      responsible to quote argument lists. See Win32::ShellQuote and
      String::ShellQuote.

    timeout

      timeout second. You can set float second.

    redirect

      if this is true, stderr redirects to stdout

    keep

      by default, if stdout/stderr is consumed, it will disappear. Disable
      this by setting keep option true

    on.stdout, on.stderr

      code refs that will be called whenever stdout/stderr is available

 run

    Run command. It returns a hash reference, which contains:

    result

    timeout

    stdout

    stderr

MOTIVATION

    I develop a CPAN client App::cpm, where I need to execute external
    commands and Perl code refs with:

    timeout

    flexible logging

    high portability

    While App::cpanminus has excellent APIs for such use, I still needed to
    tweak them in App::cpm.

    So I ended up creating a seperate module, Command::Runner.
