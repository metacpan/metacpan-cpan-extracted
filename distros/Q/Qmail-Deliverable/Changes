              Perl 5.10.

VERSION:      1.03

              stop itself using that.

              Qmail deliverability checkers.

VERSION:      1.02
new:          Support for bouncesaying, although without using the configured
              error message. Plesk puts |bouncesaying in .qmail-default.

VERSION:      1.01
change:       qpsmtpd plugin check_qmail_deliverable installs as a binary, so
              that it has a manpage. If you execute it, you get installation
              instructions.

fix:          Exclusions now enabled for smtproutes.
incompatible: ::Client::qmail_local no longer returns undef on connection error,
              because undef already meant something else.
new:          qmail-deliverabled has basic statistics in $0.
docs:         Minor documentation updates.

VERSION:      1.00
new:          First CPAN release.
