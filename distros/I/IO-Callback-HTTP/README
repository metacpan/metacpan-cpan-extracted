NAME
    IO::Callback::HTTP - read/write from HTTP URIs as if they were filehandles

SYNOPSIS
     use IO::Callback::HTTP;
 
     my $fh = IO::Callback::HTTP->new("<", "http://www.example.com/");
 
     while (my $line = <$fh>)
     {
        print $line;
     }

DESCRIPTION
    This module allows you to read from and write to HTTP resources as if they
    were normal file handles (in fact, any non-HTTP resources supported by
    LWP::UserAgent ought to be OK too, including FTP, Gopher, etc).

    Why would you do this? Not for efficiency reasons, that's for sure.
    However, certain APIs expect to be passed filehandles; this module gives
    you those filehandles.

    Files can be opened in either read mode, using:

     my $fh = IO::Callback::HTTP->new('<', $request, %options);

    or write mode:

     my $fh = IO::Callback::HTTP->new('>', $request, %options);

    The $fh variable will then act like a normal Perl filehandle, but instead
    of interacting with a local file on disk, you'll be interacting with an
    HTTP resource on a remote server.

    $request can be a URI (either a string, or a blessed URI object), or it
    can be an HTTP::Request object. A URI is obviously simpler, but using an
    HTTP::Request object offers you more flexibility, such as the ability to
    change the HTTP method (defaults to GET for filehandles opened in read
    mode, and PUT for filehandles opened in write mode) or include particular
    HTTP headers (some of which are very useful: Accept, Content-Type,
    User-Agent, etc).

    Note that for a single filehandle, only one HTTP request is actually made.
    In the case of read mode, this happens on the first read. If no characters
    are read from the handle, then no request is made. In the case of write
    mode, the request happens once the file is closed.

    There are also a few options which can be passed to the constructor:

    `agent`
        An LWP::UserAgent object (or a subclass, such as WWW::Mechanize or
        LWPx::ParanoidAgent) that will actually make the request.

        This is optional; IO::Callback::HTTP does have its own pet UA that it
        can use if you don't provide one.

    `bytes`
        In read mode, if true, will make sure the data read from the handle is
        returned encoded as a UTF-8 byte string. If false, then the data read
        will be returned as a utf8 character string.

        In write mode, if true, will assume that you're writing bytes to the
        filehandle. If false, will assume that you're writing utf8 character
        strings to the filehandle, so will deal with encoding them to UTF-8
        octets.

        Defaults to true.

    `failure`
        Set this to a coderef to trigger when the HTTP request fails (i.e.
        times out or non-2XX HTTP response code). It is passed a single
        parameter, which is the HTTP::Response object.

        As a shortcut, the strings 'croak', 'confess', 'carp' and 'cluck' are
        also accepted, with the same meanings as defined in Carp.

        Either way, IO::Callback::HTTP should do the correct thing, setting $!
        and so on.

    `success`
        Set this to a coderef to trigger when the HTTP request succeeds (i.e.
        2XX HTTP response code). It is passed a single parameter, which is the
        HTTP::Response object.

        For filehandles in read mode, this is probably not especially useful,
        the fact that you can read from the file handle at all indicates that
        the request was successful. In write mode, it's more interesting as
        you may be interested in the result of a POST or PUT request.

CAVEATS
    Most of the test suite is skipped on MSWin32 because Test::HTTP::Server
    does not currently support that platform. IO::Callback::HTTP is *believed*
    to function correctly on Windows, but it's had no meaningful testing.
