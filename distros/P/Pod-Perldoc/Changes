    * No changes - roll an official
      release for inclusion in Perl 5.22

3.24_02 - Wed Jan 21 03:12:37 UTC 2015
    * Dave Mitchell sent a patch to reduce stderr spam
      during core perl builds. Resolves RT#101493

3.24_01 - Wed Sep 10 03:13:58 UTC 2014
    * The 'ToTerm' backend generates terminal escape sequences that
      the 'less' pager does not display by default. The "-R" option
      controls this, so pass it in the LESS environment variable
      to avoid disturbing other pager invocations. Patch by 
      Niko Tyni. Closes RT#98636

    * Unify filehandle opens and encoding into two methods
      'open_fh' and 'set_encoding'.  Based on a pull request

      of 'use base'

3.24 - Tue Aug 19 03:38:07 UTC 2014
    * Release 3.24

    Make sure when we open a filehandle for reading

    test releases will be 3.23_01, etc. 

    See https://twitter.com/frioux/status/429245594180128769
    for context.

3.22_02 - Wed Feb  5 05:08:34 UTC 2014
    * Add a pager that doesn't redirect stdin RT#85173
      Added a special pager environment variable for use
      when perldoc is in the -m mode that doesn't
      redirect STDIN.  Set PERLDOC_SRC_PAGER to use. 
      
      As in:

      PERLDOC_SRC_PAGER=/usr/bin/vim perldoc -m File::Temp

    * Teach ToTerm.pm to get terminal width RT#85467
      Get a terminal width and pass it to Pod::Text::Termcap
      from one of these sources (in order):
          1. An explicit width set from command line with -w
          2. MANWIDTH environment variable
          3. stty output
          4. The default width of 76 (same as Pod::Text)

3.22_01 - Sat Feb  1 05:00:13 UTC 2014
    * Match =item more carefully when scanning perlfunc.

      on words like 'size' and 'precision' which are not 
      Perl functions.
    * Cleanup code related to mandoc RT #85844
      Patch by Ingo Schwarze
    * Re-add '-U' flag to skip attempting to drop 
      privileges. RT #87837
    * Do not install to INSTALLDIRS after Perl 5.11 RT #89756
    * Refactor search_perlop (finds operators like 'q' 
      'qq' 'tr' and others) RT #86506. Previously most of
      the text generated was incorrect.
    * Fix wrong version in DEBUG output from ToTerm.pm RT #85468

      make sure we open filehandles with utf8 and add an
      =encoding (RT #80527) (RT #80640)

3.19 - Mon Jan 28 04:29:40 UTC 2013

3.14_08 - 2008-11-01
	* no code changes from 3.14_07
	* summary of main changes:

		- old -v (Verbosely describe) is now -D
		- 'perldoc intro' will find 'perlintro' page
		- 'perldoc -L it' can find Italian translations
		of documentation (if you have them)

3.14_07 - 2008-05-08
	* Pod::Perldoc now has POD
	* so does Pod::Perldoc::BaseTo and Pod::Perldoc::GetOptsOO

3.14_06 - 2008-05-02
	* 'perldoc intro' may find 'perlintro' page
	  (suggested by Gisle Aas)
	* -v (Verbosely describe) is now -D
	* perldoc -v PerlVar

3.14_05 - 2008-04-22
	* Search perlvar

	  (after a patch by Ovid, 2008-02-26)
	  [rt.cpan.org #33624]
	* [RFC] the switch name is experimental: I am open
	to convincing alternatives (other than -v and -V
	which are already taken).

3.14_04 - 2008-04-16
	* 'lib' & co. are added to search path if -f Build.PL
	in current directory (rt.cpan.org #33941)

			  $ perldoc -L it perldocpage
	  retrieves the standard (English) version if it cannot find
	  the Italian translation.
	* applied to bleed as Change #31762

3.14_01 - 2007-08-23

3.14 - 2004-11-30  Sean M. Burke  sburke@cpan.org
	* bugfix for Cygwin
	* Matt Johnson sends in two patches to accomodate Cygwin.
	Accepted.
	* Also changing pathsep for IS_MSWin32 || IS_Dos temp files
	from '/' to '\'.

3.13 - 2004-04-09  Sean M. Burke  sburke@cpan.org
	* minor bugfixes
	
	Ken Willians notes that Pod::Perldoc::ToMan breaks when the
	pod2man program isn't in $Config{'scriptdirexp'}.  So I make it
	look there first, but then fall back to not specifying where it
	should be found.
	
	James Michael Du Pont notes that Carp::croak isn't always loaded
	by all versions of the modules perldoc uses.  So I add an explicit
	"require Carp::croak".
	
	I add t/01_about_verbose.t just to give more diagnostics.

3.12 - 2003-10-21  Sean M. Burke  sburke@cpan.org
	* tweak for Linux man.
	
	Slaven Rezic notes that Makefile.PL should say INSTALLDIRS => "perl"
	for perl versions 5.8.1 and newer, to make installation work right
	on those perls.  Change made.
	
	Slaven Rezic notes that -q was generating an erroneous =over 8 ...
	around the sliced text from perlfaq searched via -q.  Change made
	-- this =over 8 ... =back stuff is now generated only if you're
	calling perldoc with -f (for perlfunc sections).


3.11 - 2003-10-12  Sean M. Burke  sburke@cpan.org
    * tweak for Linux man.
    Brendan O'Dea provides code for Pod/Perldoc/ToMan.pm to sets -rLL
    to what stty reports for terminal column width.


3.10 - 2003-09-10  Sean M. Burke  sburke@cpan.org
	* bugfix for cygwin
	Jari Aalto notes a problem with cygwin and the containspod routine
	-- cygwin apparently pretends there's an executable $filename file
	when there's really a "$filename.exe" file.  Added a
	cygwin-specific hack in containspod to trap this case.


3.09 - 2003-07-24  Sean M. Burke  sburke@cpan.org
	* perldoc when run as root no longer dies when it can't manage to
	drop privileges.  This is by popular demand.
	* perldoc -f -X now properly sees an -X entry regardless of
	whether it's coded as =item -X or =item I<-X>.
	* In README, changed "This is an experimental distribution of
	Perldoc," to "This is the distribution of Perldoc,"
	
	Wee little things:
	
	* Added a "use 5.006;" to the start of Perldoc.pm and the
	Makefile.PL, since we do actually need that version of perl
	for the module to even compile right.  (Altho backporting is an
	option later, if we remove the 5.6-isms.)
	* Perldoc.pm has a new constant IS_Cygwin if we ever need it.
	* Added a bit of IS_VMS logic.
	* Minor cosmetic changes to handling of -U.
	* Added a few comments here and there.

3.08 - 2003-01-18  Sean M. Burke  sburke@cpan.org
	* Fixed split-related bug in reading $Config{'pager'}.
	Thanks to Chip Turner <cturner@redhat.com> for pointing it out!

3.07 - 2002-12-01  Sean M. Burke  sburke@cpan.org
	* Minor typo fix to code in Pod::Perldoc::ToMan.
	* Added RTFREADER example to Pod::Perldoc::ToRTF docs.
	* Made Pod::Perldoc::ToTk a bit more tolerant of old Tk::Pod
	versions (pre-4.0).

3.06 - 2002-11-22  Sean M. Burke  sburke@cpan.org
	* Made it install to perldoc pand perldoc.pod now.
	* Added -V
	* Made -U a no-op switch, for legacy.
	* Corrected a few minor typoes in the usage messages.
	* Updated perldoc.pod to document the switches that were
	previously documented only in perldoc -h
	
	* Many thanks to David Hand, Avi Finkel, Iain "Spoon" Truskett,
	Conrad Heiney, Casey West, Pete Sergeant, David Dyck, Michael
	Schwern, Slaven Rezic, Hugo van der Sanden, and many others for
	lots of patient help in working on this.

3.05a - 2002-11-11  Sean M. Burke  sburke@cpan.org
	* Corrected the logic that suppresses warnings during require's or
	formattings.
	* Updated usage messages
	* Corrected bug that ignored -T when using -m

3.04a - 2002-11-11  Sean M. Burke  sburke@cpan.org
	* First public release.
	* Many new features, including the switches: -T, -d, -o, -M, -w


3.01 - Sun Nov 10 21:38:09 MST 2002
	Sean M. Burke <sburke@cpan.org>
	Massive refactoring and code-tidying.
	Now it's a module(-family)!
	Formatter-specific stuff pulled out into Pod::Perldoc::To(Whatever).pm

	Added -U insecurity option

2.01 - Sat Mar 11 15:22:33 MST 2000
	Tom Christiansen <tchrist@perl.com>, querulously.

	-added better error recognition (on no found pages, just exit. On
	missing nroff/pod2man, just display raw pod.)
	-added recursive/case-insensitive matching (thanks, Andreas). This
	slows things down a bit, unfortunately. Give a precise name, and
	it'll run faster.
