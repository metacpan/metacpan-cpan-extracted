1.9  Thu Feb  2 00:46:46 CET 2006
	- added patch by Nicholas Clark to force optimization,
          which is required for syscalls to be inlined on ia32.

1.8  Wed Aug 17 18:56:14 CEST 2005
	- return immediately from poll_wait if nreqs==0.
        - use <linux/unistd.h> and try to make it work.
        - replaced tests by better ones by Brad Fitzpatrick.
        - fix a bug where the data scalar would be truncated if
          the data offset is != 0.

1.71 Sun Jul 10 19:11:36 CEST 2005
	- aio_readahead was missing in 1.7.

1.6 Fri Jul  8 01:17:04 CEST 2005
        - added changes for alpha, ia64, sparc64, hppa, v850 (thanks to Stefan Traby who

        - added t/02_read.t.

1.51 Sat Jul  2 15:18:21 CEST 2005
	- last release was borked.
	- killing threads increases nreqs count infinitely.
        - fixed a bug in queueing => many outstanding

        - clarify licensing (same terms as perl itself).

1.3 Sat Aug  7 17:25:31 CEST 2004
	- ported to AMD64, possibly other 64 bit architecturs
          (inspired by Joshua Hoblitt).
        - removed support for old libcs, kernels (2.2).

1.2 Sun Jul 18 12:54:43 CEST 2004
	- do not clone signal handlers.
        - when the parent thread dies, kill the child threads.
        - added aio_unlink support (Brad Fitzpatrick <brad@danga.com>)

1.1 Fri May  7 02:57:36 CEST 2004

	- better support threaded perls.

1.0  Wed May  5 15:54:23 CEST 2004
	- improved the documentation and made a 1.0 release. Whoopa!

0.1  Tue Apr  2 04:35:28 CEST 2002
	- use pread/pwrite instead of lseek+read/write.
        - fixed syscall prototypes.

        - fixed max_parallel deadlock problem.
        - beginning of a testsuite.

        - paths are now properly saved.

0.011 Tue Dec 25 03:02:30 CET 2001
	- make it compile with 5.6.1 and maybe older versions. Boy is it
          ugly now.

0.01  Mon Oct  8 14:57:59 CEST 2001
