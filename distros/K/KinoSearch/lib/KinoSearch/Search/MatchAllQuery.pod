KinoSearch::Search::MatchAllQuery - Query which matches all documents.

The KinoSearch code base has been assimilated by the Apache L<Lucy> project.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

MatchAllQuery is a utility class which matches all documents.  Each match
is assigned a score of 0.0, so that in composite queries, any document
which matches against another part of the query will be ranked higher than
a document which matches only via the MatchAllQuery.
