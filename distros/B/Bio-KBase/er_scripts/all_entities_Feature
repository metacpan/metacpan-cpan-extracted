=head1 all_entities_Feature

Return all instances of the Feature entity.

A feature (sometimes also called a gene) is a part of a
genome that is of special interest. Features may be spread across
multiple DNA sequences (contigs) of a genome, but never across more
than one genome. Each feature in the database has a unique
ID that functions as its ID in this table.
Normally a Feature is just a single contigous region on a contig.
Features have types, and an appropriate choice of available types
allows the support of protein-encoding genes, exons, RNA genes,
binding sites, pathogenicity islands, or whatever.


Example:

    all_entities_Feature -a 

would retrieve all entities of type Feature and include all fields
in the entities in the output.

=head2 Related entities

The Feature entity has the following relationship links:

=over 4
    
=item Controls CoregulatedSet

=item Encompasses Feature

=item HasCoregulationWith Feature

=item HasFunctional Role

=item HasIndicatedSignalFrom Experiment

=item HasLevelsFrom ProbeSet

=item IsAnnotatedBy Annotation

=item IsContainedIn SSCell

=item IsCoregulatedWith Feature

=item IsEncompassedIn Feature

=item IsExemplarOf Role

=item IsFormedInto AtomicRegulon

=item IsInPair Pairing

=item IsLocatedIn Contig

=item IsMemberOf Family

=item IsOwnedBy Genome

=item IsRegulatedIn CoregulatedSet

=item Produces ProteinSequence

=head2 Command-Line Options

=over 4

=item -a

Return all fields.

=item -h

Display a list of the fields available for use.

=item -fields field-list

Choose a set of fields to return. Field-list is a comma-separated list of 
strings. The following fields are available:

=over 4

=item feature_type

=item source_id

=item sequence_length

=item function

=item alias

=head2 Output Format

The standard output is a tab-delimited file. It consists of the input
file with an extra column added for each requested field.  Input lines that cannot
be extended are written to stderr.
