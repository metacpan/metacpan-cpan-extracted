          common to BOTH systems starting with test.
        - Add a no_data flag to the data handed to Template::Toolkit
          in order to handle cases properly where there is no
          data for the current period and hostname.
        - Add a merge flag to the data handed to Template::Toolkit
          in order to know weither merge mode is active or not
          in the templates
