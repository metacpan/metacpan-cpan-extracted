0.002000 2014-07-24T05:46:13Z
 [00 Major]
 - Reimplement as a subclass of the new CPAN::Changes::Group
 - This greatly simplifies attaching this object to a release.
 - Add a 'prelude' property for arbritray pre-text to inject in a group.
 - Add a 'name' property which can be set during construction to define the groups name
 - Add a 'has_changes' property which will determine if there are changes prior to doing any internal formatting,
   allowing usage as a pre-check if you don't want to add over-simplistic change nodes. ( Maybe I should override
   is_empty here, not sure )
