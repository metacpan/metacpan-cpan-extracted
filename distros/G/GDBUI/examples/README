These are some example programs that show how to use Term::GDBUI.



xmlexer

This is an XML-RPC command execution shell.  It is a proof of
concept so it needs a lot of clean up.  However, it is fairly
useful as it is.  See 'perldoc xmlexer' for more.


fileman-example

This is a reimplementation of the example that comes with the GNU
Readline library.  It's a command shell that demonstrates file and
directory completion.  All dangerous commands are disabled by default.



synopsys	

This is the code from Term::GDBUI's POD.  It ensures that the
code in the documentation actually runs.



tui-sample

The Term::TUI module includes an example of its own.  I have
re-implemented this example using Term::GDBUI to illustrate the
similarities and differences between the two modules.
