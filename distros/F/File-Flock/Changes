    - Bugfix in &unlock for if the lock file has been removed.

    - Added $av0debug variable to note locking attempts in $0

    [2001-05-18]

    - Added lock_rename to the EXPORT list.

100.092501 2000-09-25

    - Added tests to make sure 'nonblocking' works

99.121701 1999-12-17

    - Added the lock_rename() function.

99.062201 1999-06-22

    - SunOS systems seem to fail with EWOULDBLOCK on locked files.

    [1999-06-21]

    - It appears that on some systems (HP-UX) a blocking call to flock()
      can fail with EACCES instead of EAGAIN.

    [1999-06-15]

    - Perl changes.  File::Flock must change to keep up.  A call to
      lock() had to be changed to &lock().  Why?

98.120101 1998-12-01

    - More fixes for Solaris.  

    - Modified the unlock() function so that it can be called as a reference.

98.113001 1998-11-30

    - Fixed the object-style interface.  

    - Attempt to fix a double-unlock bug that makes the Linux port unhappy

98.112801 1998-11-26	

    - Chaged O_RDONLY to O_RDWR for all file opens because Solaris won't let
      you get an exclusive lock on a read-only file.  Crazy!  Change suggested
      by Lupe Christoph <lupe@alanya.m.isar.de>.  Thanks!

    - Rewrote the handling of the removal of files created just so that
      they could be locked.  Also tried to make sure that now file descriptors
      could get leaked.
