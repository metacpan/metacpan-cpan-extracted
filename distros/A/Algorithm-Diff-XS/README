NAME
    Algorithm::Diff::XS - Algorithm::Diff with XS core loop

SYNOPSIS
        # Drop-in replacement to Algorithm::Diff, but "compact_diff"
        # and C<LCSidx> will run much faster for large data sets.
        use Algorithm::Diff::XS qw( compact_diff LCSidx );

DESCRIPTION
    This module is a simple re-packaging of Joe Schaefer's excellent but not
    very well-known Algorithm::LCS with a drop-in interface that simply
    re-uses the installed version of the Algorithm::Diff module.

    Note that only the "LCSidx" function is optimized in XS at the moment,
    which means only "compact_diff" will get significantly faster for large
    data sets, while "diff" and "sdiff" will run in identical speed as
    "Algorithm::Diff".

BENCHMARK
                          Rate     Algorithm::Diff Algorithm::Diff::XS
    Algorithm::Diff     14.7/s                  --                -98%
    Algorithm::Diff::XS  806/s               5402%                  --

    The benchmarking script is as below:

        my @data = ([qw/a b d/ x 50], [qw/b a d c/ x 50]);
        cmpthese( 500, {
            'Algorithm::Diff' => sub {
                Algorithm::Diff::compact_diff(@data)
            },
            'Algorithm::Diff::XS' => sub {
                Algorithm::Diff::XS::compact_diff(@data)
            },
        });
