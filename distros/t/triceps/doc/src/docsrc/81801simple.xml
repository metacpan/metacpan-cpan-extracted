		<title>Simple types reference</title>

		<indexterm>
			<primary>SimpleType</primary>
		</indexterm>
		<para>
		The simple types are defined as instances of the abstract class
		SimpleType, defined in <pre>type/SimpleType.h</pre>.
		They have one method in addition to the base Type:
		</para>

<pre>
int getSize() const;
</pre>

		<para>
		It returns the size of the value of this type. For void it's 0, for
		string 1 (the minimal size of an empty string, consisting of only a
		\0 at the end), for the rest of them it's a sizeof.
		This size is used to extract the values from and copy the values to the
		compact row format.
		</para>

		<para>
		For now this is the absolute minimum of information that makes the data
		usable. The list of methods will be extended over time. For example,
		the methods for value comparisons will eventually go here. And if the
		rows will ever hold the aligned values, the alignment information too.
		</para>

		<para>
		The classes for all the actual
		simple types are defined in <pre>type/AllSimpleTypes.h</pre>:
		</para>

		<indexterm>
			<primary>VoidType</primary>
		</indexterm>
		<indexterm>
			<primary>Uint8Type</primary>
		</indexterm>
		<indexterm>
			<primary>Int32Type</primary>
		</indexterm>
		<indexterm>
			<primary>Int64Type</primary>
		</indexterm>
		<indexterm>
			<primary>Float64Type</primary>
		</indexterm>
		<indexterm>
			<primary>StringType</primary>
		</indexterm>
<pre>
VoidType
Uint8Type
Int32Type
Int64Type
Float64Type
StringType 
</pre>

		<para>
		You can construct the new objects of these classes but usually the
		pre-created shared objects are easier to use, as described in
		<xref linkend="sc_cpp_types" xrefstyle="select: label quotedtitle pageabbrev"/>&xrsp;.
		The shared objects also make the type comparisons for equality and match more efficient,
		since the comparison gets short-circuited at the object pointer stage.
		</para>
