NAME
    Catalyst::Plugin::RedirectAndDetach - Redirect and detach at the same
    time

SYNOPSIS
        # load the plugin

        use Catalyst qw( RedirectAndDetach );

        # in your controller ...

        sub admin
        {
            my $self = shift;
            my $c    = shift;

            $c->redirect_and_detach('/')
                unless $c->stash()->{user}->is_admin();

            ...
        }

DESCRIPTION
    I generally find that if I want to issue a redirect in my web app, I
    want to stop processing right there. This plugin adds a ridiculously
    simply method to your Catalyst objects to do just that.

    The reason to use "detach()" instead of simply returning from the
    current sub is that "detach()" throws an exception that effectively
    aborts all execution, rather than simply exiting the current method.

METHODS
    This class provides one method:

  $c->redirect_and_detach( $uri, $status )
    The $uri parameter is required, and $status is optional. Internally,
    this just calls "redirect()" on the Response object, followed by
    "detach()".
