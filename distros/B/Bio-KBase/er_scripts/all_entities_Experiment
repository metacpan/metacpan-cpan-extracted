=head1 all_entities_Experiment

Return all instances of the Experiment entity.

An experiment is a combination of conditions for which gene expression
information is desired. The result of the experiment is a set of expression
levels for features under the given conditions.

Example:

    all_entities_Experiment -a 

would retrieve all entities of type Experiment and include all fields
in the entities in the output.

=head2 Related entities

The Experiment entity has the following relationship links:

=over 4
    
=item AffectsLevelOf AtomicRegulon

=item HasResultsFor ProbeSet

=item HasValueFor Attribute

=item IndicatesSignalFor Feature

=item OperatesIn Media


=back


=head2 Command-Line Options

=over 4

=item -a

Return all fields.

=item -h

Display a list of the fields available for use.

=item -fields field-list

Choose a set of fields to return. Field-list is a comma-separated list of 
strings. The following fields are available:

=over 4

=item source

=back    
   
=back

=head2 Output Format

The standard output is a tab-delimited file. It consists of the input
file with an extra column added for each requested field.  Input lines that cannot
be extended are written to stderr.
