	- Support loading parameterized wordlist with syntax -w
	  Mod=param1,param2,...

	  straight to next_word().

	- [doc] Remove old FAQ item (--random has been re-added).


0.273   2020-05-22  Released-By: PERLANCAR; Urgency: medium

	- No longer apply WordListMod::RandomSeekPick; let the wordlist modules
	  themselves decide whether they want the behavior.


0.272   2020-05-22  Released-By: PERLANCAR; Urgency: medium

	- [optimize] When random-picking from a single wordlist, use the

	  WordListMod::RandomSeekPick.

0.268   2020-05-02  Released-By: PERLANCAR; Urgency: medium; Backward-Compatible: no

	- [incompatible change] CLI now streams output; output starts
          immediately. This break code that calls App::wordlist::wordlist() and
          expects an array payload.

        - Do not stop when a WordList::* module cannot be loaded; print error
          message but continue.

	- [removed] Remove option --random (-r) because it is incompatible with
	  streaming output. UPDATE 2020-05-18: this option has been re-added in
	  0.270.

0.25    2016-09-26  Released-By: PERLANCAR
