VERSION
    Version 0.10

SYNOPSIS
        use WebService::Embedly;
        use Ouch qw(:traditional);

        my $embedly = WebService::Embedly->new({ api_key => 'get_your_key_at_embed.ly',

        my $e = try {
          $oembed_ref = $embedly->oembed('http://youtu.be/I8CSt7a7gWY');
        };

        if ( catch_all, $e) {
           warn("embedly api failed: ".$e);

        my $embed_html = $oembed_ref->{html};

DESCRIPTION
    The "WebService::Embedly" is a class implementing for querying the
    Embed.ly web service. Prior to using this module you should go to
    <http://embed.ly> and sign up for an api_key.

    You can quickly try out the API by executing: ./sample/usage.pl --apikey
    you_api_key_from_embed.ly

    "WebService::Embedly" exposes three methods: oembed, preview, objectify.
    Each method has additional bits of metadata about the request URL.
    oembed method follows the oembed standard documented here
    <http://oembed.com/>

    Refer to <http://embed.ly> to learn more about the data that is returned
    for preview <http://embed.ly/docs/endpoints/1/preview> and objectify
    <http://embed.ly/docs/endpoints/2/objectify>

    Exception handling is used to expose failures. The Ouch module
    (:traditional) is used to handle try/catch blocks. See the Exception
    block below for all the possible catches. Example:

        my $e = try {
          $oembed_ref = $embedly->oembed('http://youtu.be/I8CSt7a7gWY');
        };

        if ( catch 500, $e) {
           #Server is down
           return;
        }
        if ( catch 401, $e) {
           #Your API key has used all its credits
           return;
        }
        elsif ( catch_all, $e) {
           #I hate the individual exception catching, lets get this over with it.
           return;
        }

    "WebService::Embedly" uses Mouse (lighter version of Moose) to handle
    its object management.

CONSTRUCTOR
    You must pass the api_key into the constructor:

        my $embedly = WebService::Embedly->new({ api_key => 'get_your_key_at_embed.ly'});

    "WebService::Embedly" uses LWP::UserAgent to handle its web requests.
    You have the option to pass in your own LWP object in case of special
    requirements, like a proxy server:

        my $ua = LWP::UserAgent->new();
        $ua->proxy('http', 'http://proxy.sn.no:8001/');

        my $embedly = WebService::Embedly->new({ api_key => 'get_your_key_at_embed.ly',
                                          ua => $ua
                                        });

  Optional Params
    "WebService::Embedly" supports all optional parameters at the time of
    this writing <http://embed.ly/docs/endpoints/arguments>. Refer to the
    embedly documentation for the complete description. In the majority of
    cases you only need to pay attention to the maxwidth param. It is highly
    recommended to specify maxwidth since the embed html could overflow the
    space you provide for it.

   maxwidth
    This is the maximum width of the embed in pixels. maxwidth is used for
    scaling down embeds so they fit into a certain width. If the container
    for an embed is 500px you should pass maxwidth=500 in the query
    parameters.

   maxheight
    This is the maximum height of the embed in pixels.

   width
    Will scale embeds type rich and video to the exact width that a
    developer specifies in pixels.

   format (default: json)
    The response format - Accepted values: (xml, json)

   callback
    Returns a (jsonp) response format. The callback is the name of the
    javascript function to execute.

   wmode
    Will append the wmode value to the flash object. Possible values include
    window, opaque and transparent.

   allowscripts (default: false)
    By default Embedly does not return script embeds for jsonp requests.
    They just don’t work and cause lots of issues. In some cases, you may
    need the script tag for saving and displaying later. Accepted values:
    (true, false)

   nostyle (default: false)
    There are a number of embeds that Embedly has created including
    Amazon.com, Foursquare, and Formspring. These all have style elements
    and inline styles associated with them that make the embeds look good.
    Accepted values: (true, false)

   autoplay (default: false)
    This will tell the video/rich media to automatically play when the media
    is loaded. Accepted values: (true, false)

   videosrc (default: false)
    Either true Embedly will use the video_src meta or Open Graph tag to
    create a video object to embed. Accepted values: (true, false)

   words
    The words parameter has a default value of 50 and works by trying to
    split the description at the closest sentence to that word count.

   chars
    chars is much simpler than words. Embedly will blindly truncate a
    description to the number of characters you specify adding ... at the
    end when needed.

EXCEPTIONS
    All exceptions are thrown in terms of http status codes. Exceptions from
    the web service are passed through directly. For example
    <http://embed.ly/docs/endpoints/1/oembed> and scroll down to view the
    Error Codes. For most situations you can simply do this:

        my $e = try {
          $oembed_ref = $embedly->oembed('http://youtu.be/I8CSt7a7gWY');
        };

        if ( catch_all, $e) {
           warn("embedly api failed: ".$e);
           #do something...
        }

METHODS
  oembed;
  preview;
  objectify;
    Embed.ly provide three different methods: oembed, preview, objectify
    depending on the amount of information/access you need each take the
    same parameters. However different data is returned depending on which
    method used.

    There are three ways to call each method

   Single URL
    Fetch metadata about a single URL - call method with full url as a
    string

        $oembed_ref = $embedly->oembed('http://youtu.be/I8CSt7a7gWY');

   Multiple URLs
    Fetch metadata about multiple URLs - call method with array ref of urls

       my @urls = qw(http://yfrog.com/ng41306327j http://twitter.com/embedly/status/29481593334 http://blog.embed.ly/31814817 http://soundcloud.com/mrenti/merenti-la-karambaa);
       $oembed_ref = $embedly->oembed(\@urls);

   Extra Information
    Fetch metadata about URL(s) and include additional query arguments
    <http://embed.ly/docs/endpoints/arguments> - call methods with with hash
    ref of attributes

       my $query_ref = {

    Can throw an exception (ouch) so wrap in an eval or use Ouch module and
    refer to its syntax
