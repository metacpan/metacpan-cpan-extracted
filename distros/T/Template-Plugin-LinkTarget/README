NAME

    Template::Plugin::LinkTarget - Template Toolkit filter to add "target"
    attribute to all HTML links

SYNOPSIS

      [% USE LinkTarget(target="_blank" exclude=['www.example.com']) %]
      ...
      [% FILTER linktarget %]
        <a href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a>
      [% END %]
      ...
      [% text | linktarget %]

DESCRIPTION

    Template::Plugin::LinkTarget is a filter plugin for Template::Toolkit,
    which adds a target attribute to all HTML links found in the filtered
    text.

    Through the use of the exclude option, you can specify URLs that are
    not given a new target attribute. This can be used to set up a filter
    that leaves internal links alone but that sets up external links to
    open in a new browser window. exclude accepts a list of regular
    expressions, so you can be as elaborate as you'd like.

    The target option specifies what target you'd like to give to links,
    defaulting to "_blank".

METHODS

    init()

      Initializes the template plugin.

    filter($text, $args, $conf)

      Filters the given text, and adds the "target" attribute to links.
