# IP::Country Installation Instructions #
#########################################


1. INSTALLATION THROUGH THE CPAN SHELL
--------------------------------------
If you have the CPAN shell installed and working, you should be able
to install the latest version of this distribution by the following
commands:

  $ perl -MCPAN -e shell

  cpan> install IP::Country

The most likely problems to occur are insufficient privileges to 
install into the default module location (usually solved by running
the CPAN shell as root), or a lack of some prerequisite such as GNU 
make or an FTP command-line client.

The CPAN shell can be an immensely labour-saving tool when properly 
configured. It is worthwhile spending some time getting it right.


2. INSTALLING FROM SOURCE CODE
------------------------------
The latest version of this distribution can be found using the CPAN
search engine:
  http://search.cpan.org/search?query=IP::Country&mode=dist

Download the latest version using your web browser, and unzip the 
distribution:

  $ tar -zxvf IP-Country-2.11.tar.gz

The above command works with GNU tar. Other versions of tar might not
support the 'z' flag. In that case, refer to your operating system's
instructions for unpacking.

A directory will have been created below your current directory. From
this new directory, make and test the modules:

  $ cd IP-Country-2.11/
  $ perl Makefile.PL
  $ make
  $ make test

The above commands obviously rely on you having a working version of
'make' installed on your system. Most Unix and Linux installations come
with make pre-installed. If you do not have make, it's worthwhile 
spending some time installing it, as most source code that you will 
download in future will rely on make being available. However, if you
can't or don't want to install make, you can still install this module
(see INSTALLING WITHOUT MAKE, below).

The tests might take a while on slower machines. Be patient.

If all tests run without errors, you can complete the installation 
process:

  # make install

This final stage might require superuser privileges.

If the building and testing process throw any errors, DO NOT attempt to 
install. The problem will probably be solved by installing some 
pre-requisite as indicated in the errors, but it might also be an 
indicator of some underlying problems with the code in the modules.


3. INSTALLING WITHOUT MAKE
--------------------------
It is possible to install without a working version of make. From the
unzipped distribution directory, copy the lib/IP directory into your
Perl INCLUDE path. For example, on my PC, I can use the following
command:

  # cp -r lib/IP /usr/local/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.8.0/
  # chmod -R uga+r /usr/local/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.8.0/IP

Note how I use the 'r' flag with the copy command to recursively
copy the distribution directories. The second command changes 
permissions to allow any user to use the modules.

I found out the location of the INCLUDE directories using 'perl -V':

  $ perl -V
  Summary of my perl5 (revision 5.0 version 8 subversion 0) config:
    Platform:
      osname=linux, osvers=2.4.18-14, archname=i686-linux

  ... LOT OF INFORMATION HERE ...

    Compiled at Oct 25 2002 14:55:23
    @INC:
      /usr/local/lib/perl5/5.8.0/i686-linux
      /usr/local/lib/perl5/5.8.0
      /usr/local/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.8.0/i686-linux
      /usr/local/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.8.0
      /usr/local/lib/perl5/site_perl
      .
  $ 

Copying into your INCLUDE path will probably require superuser 
privileges. If you don't have such privileges, it is still possible
to use the modules within your programs. Copy the modules to some
location where you have read/write privileges. For example:

  $ copy -r lib /home/nigel/perllibs
  $ chmod -R uga+r /home/nigel/perllibs/

Now, inside your Perl programs, you can use the modules by first 
setting the INCLUDE path.

  #!/usr/local/bin/perl -w
  use strict;
  use lib '/home/nigel/perllibs';
  use IP::Country::Fast;


4. BUILDING YOUR OWN DATABASE
-----------------------------
WARNING: you need a lot (650MB) of free RAM to create the databases
from raw files. These scripts use lots of physical memory to speed
up a process that would take days to complete if I used a relational
database.

The current distribution is bundled with a recent version of the 
country-code database. This version has been tested by the author of 
these modules, so is likely to work. I'm sure that some people will
be interested to know how the database has been constructed, and want
to build their own versions of the database. This is possible using
the two scripts provided in the dbmScripts directory (ipcc_loader.pl 
and ipcc_maker.pl).

The first script (ipcc_loader.pl) processes the files found in the 
./rir_data directory, and produces a sorted flat file of non-overlapping
IP ranges. The files in the ./rir_data directory are recent statistics
from the four regional internet registries (RIRs). The RIPE and ARIN 
statitics require unzipping before running the script.

  ftp://ftp.ripe.net/ripe/dbase/split/ripe.db.inetnum.gz
  ftp://ftp.arin.net/other/dump/aup_dump.txt.gz
  ftp://ftp.apnic.net/public/apnic/stats/apnic/
  ftp://ftp.lacnic.net/pub/stats/lacnic/

** I also usually include the stats dumps from RIPE and ARIN - I've
found that the arin aup_dump doesn't contain all of their ranges **

The output of ipcc_loader.pl (sorted_ranges.txt) is read by the second
script (ipcc_maker.pl) to produce two database files in the 
lib/IP/Country/Fast directory named ip.gif and cc.gif. They have been
given the .gif suffix to help some FTP clients properly cope with
their binary contents. 

Eventually, I will properly document the format of the database. Until
that time, you will need to refer to ipcc_maker.pl and Fast.pm
to understand the format.

The IP::Authority database can be created using the ipauth* scripts.
