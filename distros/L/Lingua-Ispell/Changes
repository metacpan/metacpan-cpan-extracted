Revision history for Perl extension Lingua::Ispell.

0.07  Tue Apr 18 11:09:59 EDT 2000
	- removed support for non-terse mode; this saves me from having to try to
	  parse the input line the same as ispell does.  The downside is that user
	  programs don't get reports on correctly spelled words.  Hopefully this
	  fixes a lot of bugs.
	- "*_dictionaries" subs renamed as "*_dictionary"

0.06  Fri Apr 14 16:51:44 EDT 2000
