====================================
[ENHANCEMENTS]
Measurements are now in milliseconds, not seconds.

Now shows nesting level in the notes.

The times are all shown as a summary at the end, not throughout
the page.

====================================
[FIXES]
When calling

    [% PROCESS block_1 + block_2 %]

the block names are passed as an array reference to process().
Template::Timer was assuming that any ref() passed was an object
and calling ->name on that object.  Thanks to Bill Moseley.
