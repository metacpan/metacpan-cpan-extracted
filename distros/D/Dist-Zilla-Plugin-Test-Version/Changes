Revision history for Dist-Zilla-Plugin-Test-Version

1.09      2016-05-08
  - Require Dist::Zilla 5.036

1.08      2016-05-06
  - migrated to Path::Tiny (ether gh#10)

1.07      2016-05-02
  - Add an "adaptive" option for is_strict.  This allows you to require
    strict checking for production releases, while being less strict for
    trial releases.
  - Create file during the gather stage, but evaluate the template during
    the munge files stage, as with similar such plugins (exaple [Test::EOL]).
  - require latest version of Test::Script.
    Some smokers were barfing on an "argument list too long" error,
    and this should fix that issue.

1.06      2016-04-24
  - Handle the corner case where you specify a finder with no files
    a little more gracefully.
  - Compatability with Dist::Zilla 5.x, 6.x and hopefully 7.x

1.05      2015-06-30
  - Test is now generated as an author test (in xt/author instead of
    xt/release) so it can be run on every commit rather than just before
    release (Dave Rolsky gh#4)

1.04      2015-06-17
  - Added multiple option (requires Test::Version 2.02)
