0.0.3  Fri Apr 13 20:30:47 2007

    - Fixed test suite
      (Removed YAML dependency;
       Instead of line-by-line comparison of serializations, the
       tests now walk the expected and actual DOM representations in parallel,
       comparing node values via the objects' accessor methods;
       This version of the test suite could easily be adapted to any
       implementation of Pod parsing. Look at the 'make_tests' program and
       the 't_source' directory to see how the tests are now declaratively
       specified and auto-generated.

0.0.5  Wed Apr 25 18:24:46 2007

    - Added is_verbatim() method to DOM

    - Fixed propagation of config info into table cells (thanks John!)
