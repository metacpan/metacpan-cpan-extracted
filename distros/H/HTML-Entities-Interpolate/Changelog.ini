Comments= <<EOT
- In V 1.07 I patched t/test.t to use Test::Stream instead of Test::More, but did not patch
Makefile.PL to match. Test::More is still used for xt/author/pod.t.

Date=2013-07-09T08:56:00
Comments= <<EOT
- No code changes.
- Rename CHANGES to Changes as per CPAN::Changes::SPEC.
- Recreate META.* files so they say licence is artistic_2 rather than artistic_1.
Build.PL and Makefile.PL already said artistic_2, but the META.* files didn't.
There is no reference to licences in the source of the module itself.
This was requested by Christopher Meng who packages stuff for Fedora.

Comments= <<EOT
- Original version
- Source code author: David Nicol
- I (Ron Savage) am releasing this module, which David emailed to me,
because it is a pre-requisite for my module DBIx::Admin
- This module was recently released under the name HTML::Entitize, but
I've changed this name so it will be found more easily via CPAN searches.
The name HTML::Entitize was just a bit too obscure for its own good
