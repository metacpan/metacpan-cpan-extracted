Changes in Parse::DNS::Zone

0.70 2024-05-05
- Bump minium Perl version to 5.14, as we use the /r regexp flag.
- Fix crash bug for get_rdata, when asking about non existing
  names/rdata in list context
- Improvements to test suite
- Add support for TTL values with time-unit suffixes as
  supported by Bind9, nsd et al (supported added by Alexander
  Hartmaier)
- Convert README to markdown.

0.60 2016-11-11
- Handle backslash escaped comment characters. Patch by Daniel
  Donckers
- Adhere to CPAN::Changes::Spec for the changelog

0.51 2015-02-18
- Bump minimum Perl version to 5.10. The 0.5 release of
  Parse::DNS::Zone included usage of features introduced in
  Perl 5.10, so this is only documentating that fact.
- Declare vcs repository (and preferred issue tracker):
    https://github.com/olof/Parse-DNS-Zone

0.5 2015-02-15
- Add support for loading zones from strings. Read the POD and
  use the new constructor parameter "zonestr" to pass in the
  complete zone as a string. A new basepath parameter to the
  constructor is added so that $INCLUDE statements may still
  work.

  Suggested by Daniel J. Wright. Solves rt.cpan.org #101719.

- Tweak MANIFEST.SKIP and regenerate MANIFEST. This should solve
  warnings like:

   ==> MISMATCHED content between MANIFEST and distribution files! <==

  Reported by Daniel J. Wright.

- Skip Test::Distribution tests by default. Enable by running with
  RELEASE_TESTING=y.

  Reported by Daniel J. Wright. Solves rt.cpan.org #101794.

- Fix double appended root dot issue when $ORIGIN is "."
