 - testing improvements, and addition of new tests
 - removing variable $Revision
 - started work on separate treatment of output delimiters:
   * to define as a new style variable OutDelimiters, and
   * to introduce number, e.g., //1+ .. //1- if the output
     contains //+ string, or similarly //2+ etc.
 - Changing opening output delimiter "\n#+\n" to "#+\n" and similarly to
   other styles.  This is a significant change that may break some existing
   programs. It is an ongoing process for the other styles.

0.001 2001
 - the project Starfish started under the name SLePerl.pl, or an
   abbreviation for Something like ePerl.  After a search for related
   software that could fulfill the need that I had, the closest thing was
   the system ePerl by David Ljung Madison at
   http://marginalhacks.com/Hacks/ePerl/, however it did not offer all the
   features that I needed.
 - The work on the project as an unnamed project started in 1998.
