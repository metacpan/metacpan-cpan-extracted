SYNOPSIS
      use Crypt::GPG;
      my $gpg = new Crypt::GPG;

      $gpg->gpgbin('/usr/bin/gpg');      # The GnuPG executable.
      $gpg->secretkey('0x2B59D29E');     # Set ID of default secret key.
      $gpg->passphrase('just testing');  # Set passphrase.

      # Sign a message:

      my $sign = $gpg->sign('testing again');

      # Encrypt a message:

      my @encrypted = $gpg->encrypt ('top secret', 'test@bar.com');

      # Get message info:

      my @recipients = $gpg->msginfo($encrypted);

      # Decrypt a message.

      my ($plaintext, $signature) = $gpg->verify($encrypted);

      # Key generation:

      $keystring = $gpg->export($key);

DESCRIPTION
    The Crypt::GPG module provides access to the functionality of the GnuPG
    (www.gnupg.org) encryption tool through an object oriented interface.

    It provides methods for encryption, decryption, signing, signature
    verification, key generation, key certification, export and import.
    Key-server access is on the todo list.

    This release of the module may create compatibility issues with previous
    versions. If you find any such problems, or any bugs or documentation
    errors, please do report them to crypt-gpg at neomailbox.com.

CONSTRUCTOR
    new()
      Creates and returns a new Crypt::GPG object.

DATA METHODS
    gpgbin($path)
      Sets the GPGBIN instance variable which gives the path to the GnuPG
      binary.

    gpgopts($opts)
      Sets the GPGOPTS instance variable which may be used to pass
      additional options to the GnuPG binary. For proper functioning of this
      module, it is advisable to always include '--lock-multiple' in the
      GPGOPTS string.

    delay($seconds)
      Sets the DELAY instance variable. This is no longer necessary (nor
      used) in the current version of the module, but remains so existing
      scripts don't break.

    secretkey($keyid)
      Sets the SECRETKEY instance variable which may be a KeyID or a
      username. This is the ID of the default key to use for signing.

    passphrase($passphrase)
      Sets the PASSPHRASE instance variable, required for signing and
      decryption.

    text($boolean)
      Sets the TEXT instance variable. If set true, GnuPG will use
      network-compatible line endings for proper cross-platform
      compatibility and the plaintext will gain a newline at the end, if it
      does not already have one.

    armor($boolean)
      Sets the ARMOR instance variable, controlling the ASCII armoring of
      output. The default is to use ascii-armoring. The module has not been
      tested with this option turned off, and most likely will not work if
      you switch this off.

    detach($boolean)
      Sets the DETACH instance variable. If set true, the sign method will
      produce detached signature certificates, else it won't. The default is
      to produce detached signatures.

    encryptsafe($boolean)
      Sets the ENCRYPTSAFE instance variable. If set true, encryption will
      fail if trying to encrypt to a key which is not trusted. This is the
      default. Turn this off if you want to encrypt to untrusted keys.

    version($versionstring)
      Sets the VERSION instance variable which can be used to change the
      Version: string on the GnuPG output to whatever you like.

    comment($commentstring)
      Sets the COMMENT instance variable which can be used to change the
      Comment: string on the GnuPG output to whatever you like.

    nofork($flag)
      Sets the NOFORK instance variable which if set to a true value will
      cause keygen() not to fork a separate process for key generation.

    debug($boolean)
      Sets the DEBUG instance variable which causes the raw output of
      Crypt::GPG's interaction with the GnuPG binary to be dumped to STDOUT.
      By default, debugging is off.

OBJECT METHODS
    sign(@message)
      Signs @message with the secret key specified with secretkey() and
      returns the result as a string.

    decrypt(\@message, [\@signature])
      This is just an alias for verify()

    verify(\@message, [\@signature])
      Decrypts and/or verifies the message in @message, optionally using the
      detached signature in @signature, and returns a list whose first
      element is plaintext message as a string. If the message was signed, a
      Crypt::GPG::Signature object is returned as the second element of the
      list.

      The Crypt::GPG::Signature object can be queried with the following
      methods:

         $sig->validity();    # 'GOOD', 'BAD', or 'UNKNOWN'
         $sig->keyid();       # ID of signing key
         $sig->time();        # Time the signature was made
         $sig->trusted();     # Signature trust level

    msginfo(@ciphertext)
      Returns a list of the recipient key IDs that @ciphertext is encrypted
      to.

    encrypt($plaintext, $keylist, [-sign] )
      Encrypts $plaintext with the public keys of the recipients listed in
      $keylist and returns the result in a string, or undef if there was an
      error while processing. Returns undef if any of the keys are not
      found.

      Either $plaintext or $keylist may be specified as either an arrayref
      or a simple scalar.

      If $plaintext is a an arrayref, it will be join()ed without newlines.

      If you want to encrypt to multiple recipients, you must use the
      arrayref version of $keylist. A scalar $keylist works for only a
      single key ID.

      If the -sign option is provided, the message will be signed before
      encryption. The secret key and passphrase must be set for signing to
      work. They can be set with the secretkey() and passphrase() methods.

    addkey($key, $pretend, @keyids)
      Adds the keys given in $key to the user's key ring and returns a list
      of Crypt::GPG::Key objects corresponding to the keys that were added.
      $key may be a string or an array reference.

      If $pretend is true, it pretends to add the key and creates the key
      object, but doesn't actually perform the key addition.

      Optionally, a list of key IDs may be specified. If a list of key IDs
      is specified, only keys that match those IDs will be imported. The
      rest will be ignored.

    export($key)
      Exports the key specified by the Crypt::GPG::Key object $key and
      returns the result as a string.

    keygen($name, $email, $keytype, $keysize, $expire, $passphrase)
      Creates a new keypair with the parameters specified. The only
      supported $keytype currently is 'ELG-E'. $keysize can be any of 1024,
      2048, 3072 or 4096. Returns undef if there was an error, otherwise
      returns a filehandle that reports the progress of the key generation
      process similar to the way GnuPG does. The key generation is not
      complete till you read an EOF from the returned filehandle.

    certify($keyid, $local, @uids)
      Certifies to the authenticity of UIDs of the key with ID $keyid. If
      $local is true, the certification will be non-exportable. The @uids
      parameter should contain the list of UIDs to certify (the first UID of
      a key is 0).

    keydb(@keyids)
      Returns an array of Crypt::GPG::Key objects corresponding to the Key
      IDs listed in @keyids. This method used to be called keyinfo and that
      is still an alias to this method.

    parsekeys(@keylist)
      Parses a raw GnuPG formatted key listing in @keylist and returns an
      array of Crypt::GPG::Key objects.

    keypass($key, $oldpass, $newpass)
      Change the passphrase for a key. Returns true if the passphrase change
      succeeded, false if not, or undef if there was an error.

    delkey($keyid)
      Deletes the key specified by the Crypt::GPG::Key object $key from the
      user's key ring. Returns undef if there was an error, or 1 if the key
      was successfully deleted.

    disablekey($keyid)
      Disables the key specified by the Crypt::GPG::Key object $key.

    enablekey($keyid)
      Enables the key specified by the Crypt::GPG::Key object $key.

Crypt::GPG::Signature
        Documentation coming soon.

Crypt::GPG::Key
        Documentation coming soon.

TODO
    * Key server access.

    * More complete key manipulation interface.

    * Filehandle interface to handle large messages.

BUGS
    * Error checking needs work.

    * Some key manipulation functions are missing.

    * The method call interface is subject to change in future versions.

    * The current implementation will probably eat up all your RAM if you
      try to operate on huge messages. In future versions, this will be
      addressed by reading from and returning filehandles, rather than using
      in-core data.

    * Methods may break if you don't use ASCII armoring.
