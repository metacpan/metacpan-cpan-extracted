To install, execute the sequence

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

Win32 users should use the 'make' program on their system.

The test suite relies on the existence of Apache::Test,
available through the mod_perl 2 sources or in the
httpd-test distribution.

If you do not have permission to install modules in the
Perl site tree on your system, you can install this in
your own library by

   perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/home/me/perl \
     INSTALLMAN1DIR=/home/me/man/man1 \
     INSTALLMAN3DIR=/home/me/man/man3
   make
   make test
   make install

To use modules in this location, either set the PERL5LIB
environment variable to include your private module
directory, or else put

   use lib '/home/me/perl/path/to/lib';

at the top of your script.

A Win32 ppm package, suitable for use with ActivePerl
compatible Perl packages (builds 6xx) is available at
   http://theoryx5.uwinnipeg.ca/ppmpackages/
To install, within the ppm shell set the repository to
  http://theoryx5.uwinnipeg.ca/cgi-bin/ppmserver?urn:/PPMServer
and then
 ppm> install Apache-Geo-IP
