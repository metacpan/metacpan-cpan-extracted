NAME
    Crypt::Camellia - Perl Camellia encryption module

SYNOPSIS
      use Crypt::Camellia;
      my $cipher     = Crypt::Camellia->new($key); 
      my $ciphertext = $cipher->encrypt($plaintext);
      my $plaintext  = $cipher->decrypt($ciphertext);

      # more likely
      use Crypt::CBC;
      $cipher = Crypt::CBC->new( -key    => 'my secret key',
                                 -cipher => 'Camellia'
                                );

DESCRIPTION
    This module implements Camelia 128-bit Block Cipher for perl. For
    Camellia. Check
    <https://info.isl.ntt.co.jp/crypt/eng/camellia/index_s.html>. Here is an
    exerpt of that page.

      Camellia is a symmetric key block cipher developed jointly in 2000 by
      world top class encryption researchers at NTT and Mitsubishi Electric
      Corporation. Technologically speaking, Camellia naturally has not only
      a high level of security, but also excellent efficiency and practical
      characteristics. It can be implemented at high performance by software
      on various platforms. In regard to hardware implementation, compact
      and low-power consumption type implementation as well as high-speed
      implementation is possible.

      Based on these technological advantages, Camellia has been
      internationally recognized, for example the selection project on the
      European recommendation of strong cryptographic primitives, NESSIE,
      evaluated Camellia to have "many similarities to the AES, so much of
      the analysis for the AES is also applicable to Camellia." Currently,
      Camellia is the only cipher internationally recognized which has the
      same level of security and performance as AES, and is selected for
      many international standard/recommended ciphers. In particular, as
      Japanese domestic ciphers, this is the first case to be approved as
      IETF standard ciphers (Proposed Standard RFC) .

    Crypt::Camellia has the following methods:

       blocksize()
       keysize()
       encrypt()
       decrypt()

    Like many Crypt:: modules like Crypt::Blowfish and Crypt::DES, this
    module works as a backend of Crypt::CBC.

FUNCTIONS
    blocksize
      Returns the size (in bytes) of the block cipher. Currently this is a
      fixed value of 16.

    new
        my $cipher = Crypt::Camellia->new($key);

      This creates a new Crypt::Camellia BlockCipher object, using $key,
      where $key is a key of "keysize()" bytes (minimum of eight bytes).

    encrypt
        my $ciphertext = $cipher->encrypt($plaintext);

      This function encrypts $plaintext and returns the $ciphertext where
      $plaintext and $ciphertext must be of "blocksize()" bytes. (hint:
      Camellia is an 16 byte block cipher)

    decrypt
        my $plaintext = $cipher->decrypt($ciphertext);

      This function decrypts $ciphertext and returns the $plaintext where
      $plaintext and $ciphertext must be of "blocksize()" bytes. (hint: see
      previous hint)

EXAMPLE
      my $key = pack("H16", "0123456789ABCDEF");  # min. 8 bytes
      my $cipher = Crypt::Camellia->new($key);
      my $ciphertext = $cipher->encrypt("plaintex");# SEE NOTES 
      print unpack("H16", $ciphertext), "\n";

NOTES
    For practical uses use this module via Crypt::CBC rather than directly.
