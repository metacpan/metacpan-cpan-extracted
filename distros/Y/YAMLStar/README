NAME

    yamlstar - A cross-language, common API YAML reference framework

DESCRIPTION

    The YAMLStar project has a goal of properly implementing complete and
    fully compatible YAML frameworks in all of the most popular programming
    languages. These frameworks are intended to be published under the name
    YAMLStar on each languages packaging system.

    YAMLStar gets its name from the * (star) character and its intent to
    mean any. Think yaml.* => yaml.rb, yaml.java, yaml.rs etc...

    YAMLStar will specify a common usage API and attempt to implement the
    API in a manner that is natural to each target programming language.

    Where possible each framework implementation builds over libfyaml.
