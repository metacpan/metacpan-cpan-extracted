NAME

    Test::BrewBuild - Perl/Berry brew unit testing automation, with remote
    tester dispatching capabilities.

DESCRIPTION

    This module is the backend for the brewbuild script that is accompanied
    by this module.

    For end-user use, see brewbuild
    <https://metacpan.org/pod/distribution/Test-BrewBuild/bin/brewbuild>.
    You can also read the documentation for the network dispatcher
    bbdispatch
    <https://metacpan.org/pod/distribution/Test-BrewBuild/bin/bbdispatch>,
    the remote test listener bbtester
    <https://metacpan.org/pod/distribution/Test-BrewBuild/bin/bbtester>, or
    browse through the Test::BrewBuild::Tutorial for network testing.

    This module provides you the ability to perform your unit tests across
    all of your Perlbrew <http://perlbrew.pl> (Unix) or Berrybrew
    <https://github.com/stevieb9/berrybrew> (Windows) Perl instances.

    For Windows, you'll need to install Berrybrew
    <https://github.com/stevieb9/berrybrew>, and for Unix, you'll need
    Perlbrew <http://perlbrew.pl>.

    It allows you to remove and reinstall on each test run, install random
    versions of perl, or install specific versions.

    All unit tests are run against all installed instances, unless
    specified otherwise.

SYNOPSIS

        use Test::BrewBuild;
    
        my $bb = Test::BrewBuild->new;
    
        my @perls_available = $bb->perls_available;
        my @perls_installed = $bb->perls_installed;
    
        # remove all currently installed instances of perl, less the one you're
        # using
    
        $bb->instance_remove;
    
        # install four new random versions of perl
    
        $bb->instance_install(4);
    
        # install two specific versions
    
        $bb->instance_install(['5.10.1', '5.20.3']);
    
        # install all instances
    
        $bb->instance_install(-1);
    
        # find and test against all the current module's reverse CPAN dependencies
    
        $bb->revdep;
    
        # run the unit tests of the current module only
    
        $bb->test;

METHODS

 new(%args)

    Returns a new Test::BrewBuild object. See the documentation for the
    brewbuild
    <https://metacpan.org/pod/distribution/Test-BrewBuild/bin/brewbuild>
    script to understand what the arguments are and do.

    Many of the options can be saved in a configuration file if you want to
    set them permanently, or override defaults. Options passed into the
    various methods will override those in the configuration file. See
    config file documentation
    <https://metacpan.org/pod/distribution/Test-BrewBuild/lib/Test/BrewBuild/brewbuild.conf.pod>.

 brew_info

    Returns in string form the full output of *brew available.

 perls_available

    Returns an array containing all perls available, whether already
    installed or not.

 perls_installed

    Returns an array of the names of all perls currently installed under
    your *brew setup.

 instance_install

    If an integer is sent in, we'll install that many random versions of
    perl. If the integer is -1, we'll install all available versions. You
    can also send in an array reference, where each element is a version of
    perl, and we'll install those instead.

    You can send a second parameter, an integer for a time out. On each
    install, we'll bail if it takes longer than this time. Default is 300
    seconds. If you're on a fast machine, you should probably lower this
    value.

    On Windows, where you want to install specific perls, we'll default to
    installing 64-bit versions only, if a 64 bit perl is available for the
    version desired and you haven't added the _64/_32 suffix per berrybrew
    available.

    Simply add the _32 suffix if you want to install it specifically. Note
    that if you're dispatching to Unix and Windows servers, the Unix
    systems will remove this invalid portion of the version prior to
    processing further.

 instance_remove

    Uninstalls all currently installed perls, less the one you are
    currently switched or used to.

 test

    Processes and returns the test results as a string scalar of the
    distribution located in the current working directory.

 revdeps

    Returns a list of the reverse dependencies (according to CPAN) that the
    module you're working on in the current working directory have.

 revdep

    Loops over all of the current module's reverse dependencies, and
    executes test() on each one at a time. This helps you confirm whether
    your new build won't break your downstream users' modules.

 legacy

    By default, we don't install perl versions less than v5.8.9. Pass in a
    true value to override this default.

 options(\%args)

    Takes a hash reference of the command-line argument list, and converts
    it into a hash of the translated Test::BrewBuild parameters along with
    their values.

    Returns the converted hash for passing back into new().

    If an invalid argument is included, we'll set $args{error} = 1;. It is
    up to the caller to look for and process an error handling routine.

 config_file

    Returns a string that contains the path/filename of the configuration
    file, if available.

 plugin('Module::Name')

    Fetches and installs a custom plugin which contains the code that
    perlbrew/berrybrew exec will execute. If not used or the module
    specified can't be located (or it contains errors), we fall back to the
    default bundled Test::BrewBuild::Plugin::DefaultExec (which is the
    canonical example for writing new plugins).

    Note that you can send in a custom plugin *.pm filename to plugin as
    opposed to a module name if the module isn't installed. If the file
    isn't in the current working directory, send in the relative or full
    path.

 is_win

    Helper method, returns true if the current OS is Windows, false if not.

 log

    Returns an instance of the packages log object for creating child log
    objects.

 tempdir

    Sets up the object with a temporary directory used for test logs, that
    will be removed after the run.

 workdir

    Returns the brewbuild working directory.

 setup

    Prints out detailed information on setting up a testing environment, on
    Windows and Unix.

 help

    Displays the brewbuild command line usage information.
