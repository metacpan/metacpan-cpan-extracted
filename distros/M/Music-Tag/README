NAME
    Music::Tag - Interface for collecting information about music files.

VERSION
    Music-Tag-0.4103

DESCRIPTION
    Extendable module for working with Music Tags. Music::Tag Is powered by
    various plugins that collect data about a song based on whatever
    information has already been discovered.

    The motivation behind this was to provide a convenient method for fixing
    broken tags in music files. This developed into a universal interface to
    various music file tagging schemes and a convenient way to augment this
    from online databases.

    Several plugin modules to find information about a music file and write
    it back into the tag are available. These modules will use available
    information (REQUIRED DATA VALUES and USED DATA VALUES) and set various
    data values back to the tag.

INSTALLATION
    To install this module type the following:

       perl Makefile.PL
       make
       make test
       make install

  IMPORTANT NOTE
    If you have installed older versions (older than .25) PLEASE delete the
    following scripts from your bin folder: autotag, safetag, quicktag,
    musicsort, musicinfo.

    If you used any of these scripts, create a symbolic link to musictag for
    each.

  QUICK INSTALL OF ALL PACKAGES
    A bundle is available to quickly install Music::Tag with all plugins. To
    install it use:

       perl -MCPAN -eshell

    At the cpan shell prompt type:

       install Bundle::Music::Tag
