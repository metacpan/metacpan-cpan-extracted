NAME
    Dancer::Session::MongoDB - MongoDB session backend for Dancer.

SYNOPSIS
            # in your config.yml file:
            session: "MongoDB"
            mongodb_session_db: "myapp_database"    # required
            mongodb_session_coll: "myapp_sessions"  # optional, defaults to 'sessions'

            # you can pass connection options to MongoDB::MongoClient::new() by
            # prefixing them with 'mongodb_' like so:
            mongodb_host: "mongo.server.com"        # defaults to 'localhost'
            mongodb_port: 27017                     # this is the default
            mongodb_username: "mongodb_user"
            mongodb_password: "secret_password"

            # now you can use sessions in your app as described in L<Dancer::Session>.
            # for example:
            session user => params->{user};
        
            ...
        
            if (session('user')) {
                    my $msg = "Welcome back, ".session('user');
            }

DESCRIPTION
    This module implements a MongoDB based session engine for Dancer
    applications. It keeps session data in a MongoDB collection, providing
    you with a simple, easy to setup, yet powerful session backend.

    If you're running your Dancer application in a PSGI/Plack environment,
    please consider using Plack::Session::Store::MongoDB with
    Dancer::Session::PSGI instead.

    This module is a subclass of Dancer::Session::Abstract.

CONFIGURATION
    In order to use this session engine, you need to define a few settings
    in your app's settings file (or in your app's code):

    *   session

        Give this the value "MongoDB" (using this *exact* capitalization).
        This is required.

    *   mongodb_session_db

        Give this the name of the MongoDB database to use. This is required.

    *   mongodb_session_coll

        The name of the collection in which session objects will be stored.
        Optional, defaults to 'sessions'.

    Optionally, you can also define options for initiating the connection to
    the MongoDB server, as described in "ATTRIBUTES" in MongoDB::Connection,
    by prefixing them with 'mongodb_'. For example, if your database
    requires authentication, you can pass the 'mongodb_username',
    'mongodb_password' and possibly 'mongodb_db_name' to authenticate. Or,
    if your database server is not located on the same server your
    application resides, then you can provide 'mongodb_host' and possibly
    'mongodb_port'.

CLASS METHODS
  init()
  create()
    Creates a new session object and returns it.

  retrieve( $id )
    Returns the session object whose ID is $id if exists, otherwise returns
    a false value.

OBJECT METHODS
  flush()
    Writes the session object to the MongoDB database. If a database error
    occurs and the object is not saved, this method will die.

  destroy()
    Removes the session object from the MongoDB database. If a database
    error occurs and the object is not removed, this method will generate a
    warning.
