HTML-Chunks
-----------

A simple template system for HTML, XML and XHTML which completely separates code
from design. Designers can create a well-formed mockup for presentation purposes
which can immediately be used by developers to create a working system. Or
developers can create an interface which designers turn into something pretty.
This removes the "chicken and egg" problem which plagues traditional template
systems while making it easier to produce proper code that is easily maintained.

HTML::Chunks - The core class

HTML::Chunks::Local - A subclass which handles localization issues, based on the
   browser language preference codes (e.g. en, fr) to choose the best chunk
   to display data. Allows language fallback chaining as well, so display
   oriented chunks need not be copied tediously for each language.

HTML::Chunks::Super - A subclass with superpowers such as conditionals


PREREQUISITES

Perl 5.005 or higher.

HTML::Chunks::Super requires the IO::Scalar and Safe modules.


INSTALLATION

Normal stuff:

    perl Makefile.PL

    make test
    make install
