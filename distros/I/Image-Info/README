This Perl extension allows you to extract meta information from various
types of image files. The following file formats are supported:

   JPEG (plain JFIF and Exif)
   PNG
   GIF
   PBM/PGM/PPM
   SVG
   XBM/XPM
   BMP/DIB/RLE

Usage is something like this:

   use Image::Info qw(image_info);

   @info = image_info("filename");
   $refto_hash_describing_1st_image = $info[0];
   $refto_hash_describing_2nd_image = $info[1];
