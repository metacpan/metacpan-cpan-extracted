Finance::Bank::Postbank_de - Check your Postbank.de bank account from Perl

DESCRIPTION

This module provides a rudimentary interface to the Postbank online banking system at
https://meine.postbank.de/.

The interface was cooked up by me without taking a look at the other Finance::Bank
modules. If you have any proposals for a change, they are welcome !
