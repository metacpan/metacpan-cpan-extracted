VERSION
    Version 0.04

SYNOPSIS
        package My::MarkupEnabled;

        use Moo;                  # or Moose, or something compatible
        with 'Role::Markup::XML'; # ...and this of course

        # write some other code...

        sub something_useful {
            my $self = shift;

            # put your XML-generating data structure here
            my %spec = (
                -name      => 'my:foo',              # element name
                -content   => { -name => 'my:bar' }, # element content
                hurr       => 'durr',                # attribute
                'my:derp'  => 'lulz',                # namespaced attribute
                'xmlns:my' => 'urn:x-bogus:foo',     # namespaces go inline
            );

            # create a document object to hang on to
            my $doc  = $self->_DOC;

            # returns the last node generated, which is <my:bar/>
            my $stub = $self->_XML(
                doc  => $doc,
                spec => \%spec,
            );

                # imagine a bunch of things in here
            );

            # since these nodes will be appended to $stub, we aren't
            # interested in the output this time
            $self->_XML(
                parent => $stub,          # owner document is derived
                spec   => \@contents,     # also accepts ARRAY refs
                args   => $self->cb_args, # some useful state data
            );

            # the rest of the ops come from XML::LibXML
            return $doc->toString(1);
        }

DESCRIPTION
    This is indeed yet another module for lazy XML markup generation. It
    exists because it is different:

    *   It converses primarily in reusable, inspectable, and most
        importantly, *inert* Perl data structures,

    *   It also ingests existing XML::LibXML nodes,

    *   It enables you to generate markup *incrementally*, rather than all
        at once,

    *   It Does the Right Thing™ around a bunch of otherwise tedious
        boilerplate operations, such as namespaces, XHTML, or flattening
        token lists in attributes,

    *   It has a callback infrastructure to help you create modular
        templates, or otherwise override behaviour you don't like,

    *   It is implemented as a Role, to be more conducive to modern Perl
        development.

    I began by using XML::LibXML::LazyBuilder. It is pretty good, definitely
    preferable to typing out reams of XML::LibXML DOM-like API any time I
    wanted to make some (guaranteed well-formed) XML. I even submitted a
    patch to it to make it better. Nevertheless, I have reservations about
    the general approach to terse markup-generating libraries, in particular
    about the profligate use of anonymous subroutines. (You also see this in
    lxml.etree <http://lxml.de/tutorial.html> for Python, Builder::XmlMarkup
    <http://builder.rubyforge.org/classes/Builder/XmlMarkup.html> for Ruby,
    etc.)

    The main issue is that these languages aren't Lisp: it costs something
    at runtime to gin up a stack of nested anonymous subroutines, run them
    once, and then immediately throw them away. It likewise costs in
    legibility to have to write a bunch of imperative code to do what is
    essentially data declaration. It also costs in sanity to have to write
    function-generating-function-generating functions just to get the mess
    under control. What you get for your trouble is an interim product that
    is impossible to inspect or manipulate. This ostensibly time-saving
    pattern quickly hits a wall in both development, and at runtime.

    The answer? Use (in this case) Perl's elementary data structures to
    convey the requisite information: data structures which can be built up
    from bits and pieces, referenced multiple times, sliced, diced, spliced,
    frozen, thawed, inspected, and otherwise operated on by ordinary Perl
    routines. Provide mix-and-match capability with vanilla XML::LibXML,
    callbacks, and make the whole thing an unobtrusive mix-in that you can
    bolt onto your existing code.

METHODS
    Methods in this module are named such as to stay out of the way of
    *your* module's interface.

  _DOC [$VERSION,] [$ENCODING]
    Generate a document node. Shorthand for "new" in XML::LibXML::Document.

  _ELEM $TAG [, $DOC, \%NSMAP ]
    Generate a single XML element. Generates a new document unless $DOC is
    specified. Defaults to XHTML if no namespace map is provided.

  _XML $SPEC [, $PARENT, $DOC, $ARGS | @ARGS ] | %PARAMS
    Generate an XML tree according to the specification format. Returns the
    *last node generated* by the process. Parameters are as follows:

    spec
        The node specification. Strictly speaking this is optional, but
        there isn't much of a point of running this method if there is no
        spec to run it over.

    doc The XML::LibXML::Document object intended to own the contents.
        Optional, however it is often desirable to supply a document object
        along with the initial call to this method, so as not to have to
        fish it out later.

    parent
        The XML::LibXML::Element (or, redundantly, Document) object which is
        intended to be the parent node of the spec. Optional.

    args
        An "ARRAY" reference of arguments to be passed into "CODE"
        references embedded in the spec. Optional.

   Specification Format
    The building blocks of the spec are, unsurprisingly, "HASH" and "ARRAY"
    references. The former correspond to elements and other things, while
    the latter correspond to lists thereof. Literals become text nodes, and
    blessed objects will be treated like strings, so it helps if they have a
    string overload. "CODE" references may be used just about anywhere, and
    will be dereferenced recursively using the supplied "args" until there
    is nothing left to dereference. It is up to *you* to keep these data
    structures free of cycles.

    Elements
        Special keys designate the name and content of an element spec.
        These are, unimaginitively, "-name" and "-content". They work like
        so:

            { -name => 'body', -content => 'hurr' }

            # produces <body>hurr</body>

        Note that "-content" can take any primitive: literal, "HASH",
        "ARRAY" or "CODE" reference, XML::LibXML::Node object, etc.

    Attributes
        Any key is not "-name" or "-content" will be interpreted as an
        attribute.

            { -name => 'body', -content => 'hurr', class => 'lolwut' }

            # produces <body class="lolwut">hurr</body>

        When references are values of attributes, they are flattened into
        strings:

            { -name => 'body', -content => 'hurr', class => [qw(one two three)] }

            # produces <body class="one two three">hurr</body>

    Namespaces
        If there is a colon in either the "-name" key value or any of the
        attribute keys, the processor will expect a namespace that
        corresponds to that prefix. These are specified exactly as one would
        with ordinary XML, with the use of an "xmlns:foo" attribute>.
        (Prefix-free "xmlns" attributes likewise work as expected.)

            { -name => 'svg',
              xmlns => 'http://www.w3.org/2000/svg',
              'xmlns:xlink' => 'http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink',
              -content => [
                  { -name => 'a', 'xlink:href' => 'http://some.host/' },
              ],
            }

            # produces:
            # <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"
            #      xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">
            #   <a xlink:href="http://some.host/"/>
            # </svg>

    Other Nodes

        "-pi"
            Processing instructions are designated by the special key "-pi"
            and accept arbitrary pseudo-attributes:

                { -pi => 'xml-stylesheet', type => 'text/xsl', href => '/my.xsl' }

                # produces <?xml-stylesheet type="text/xsl" href="/my.xsl"?>

        "-doctype"
            Document type declarations are designated by the special key
            "-doctype" and accept values for the keys "public" and "system":

                { -doctype => 'html' }

                # produces <!DOCTYPE html>

        "-comment"
            Comments are designated by the special key "-comment" and
            whatever is in the value of that key:

                { -comment => 'hey you guyyyys' }

                # produces <!-- hey you guyyyys -->

    Callbacks
        Just about any part of a markup spec can be replaced by a "CODE"
        reference, which can return any single value, including another
        "CODE" reference. These are called in the context of $self, i.e., as
        if they were a method of the object that does the role. The "args"
        in the original method call form the subsequent input:

            sub callback {
                my ($self, @args) = @_;

                my %node = (-name => 'section', id => $self->generate_id);

                # ...do things to %node, presumably involving @args...

                return \%node;
            }

            sub make_xml {
                my $self = shift;

                my $doc = $self->_DOC;
                $self->_XML(
                    doc  => $doc,
                    spec => { -name => 'p', -content => \&callback },
                );

               return $doc;
            }

        "CODE" references can appear in attribute values as well.

  _XHTML | %PARAMS
    Generate an XHTML+RDFa stub. Return the "<body>" and the document when
    called in list context, otherwise return just the "<body>" in scalar
    context (which can be used in subsequent calls to "_XML").

      my ($body, $doc) = $self->_XHTML(%p);

      # or

      my $body = $self->_XHTML(%p);

   Parameters
    uri The "href" attribute of the "<base>" element.

    ns  A mapping of namespace prefixes to URIs, which by default will
        appear as *both* XML namespaces *and* the "prefix" attribute.

    prefix
        Also a mapping of prefixes to URIs. If this is set rather than "ns",
        then the XML namespaces will *not* be set. Conversely, if this
        parameter is defined but false, then *only* the contents of "ns"
        will appear in the conventional "xmlns:foo" way.

    title
        This can either be a literal title string, or "CODE" reference, or
        "HASH" reference assumed to encompass the whole "<title>" element,
        or an "ARRAY" reference where the first element is the title and
        subsequent elements are predicates.

    link
        This can either be an "ARRAY" reference of ordinary markup specs, or
        a "HASH" reference where the keys are the "rel" attribute and the
        values are one or more (via "ARRAY" ref) URIs. In the latter form
        the following behaviour holds:

        *   Predicates are grouped by "href", folded, and sorted
            alphabetically.

        *   "<link>" elements are sorted first lexically by the sorted
            "rel", then by sorted "rev", then by "href".

        *   A special empty "" hash key can be used to pass in another
            similar structure whose keys represent "rev", or reverse
            predicates.

        *   A special "-about" key can be used to specify another "HASH"
            reference where the keys are subjects and the values are similar
            structures to the one described.

          {
            # ordinary links
            'rel:prop' => [qw(urn:x-target:1 urn:x-target:2)],

            # special case for reverse links
            '' => { 'rev:prop' => 'urn:x-demo-subject:id' },

            # special case for alternate subject
            -about => {
              'urn:x-demo-subject:id' => { 'some:property' => 'urn:x-target' } },
          }

        The "ARRAY" reference form is passed along as-is.

    meta
        Behaves similarly to the "link" parameter, with the following
        exceptions:

        *   No "" or "-about" pseudo-keys, as they are meaningless for
            literals.

        *   Literal values can be expressed as an "ARRAY" reference of the
            form "[$val, $lang, $type]" with either the second or third
            element "undef". They may also be represented as a "HASH"
            reference where the keys are the language (denoted by a leading
            "@") or datatype (everything else), and the values are the
            literal values.

          {
            'prop:id' => ['foo', [2.3, undef, 'xsd:decimal']],
            'exotic'  => { '@en' => ['yo dawg', 'derp'] }
          }

    head
        This is an optional "ARRAY" reference of "<head>" elements that are
        neither "<link>" nor "<meta>" (or, if you want, additional
        unmolested "<link>" and "<meta>" elements).

    attr
        These attributes (including "-content") will be passed into the
        "<body>" element.

    content
        This parameter enables us to isolate the "<body>" content without
        additional attributes.

        Note that setting this parameter will cause the method to return the
        innermost, last node that is specified, rather than the "<body>".

    transform
        This is the URI of a (e.g. XSLT) transform which will be included in
        a processing instruction if supplied.

    args
        Same as "args" in "_XML".
