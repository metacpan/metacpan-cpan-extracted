NAME

    beamer-reveal.pl - converts the .rvl file and the corresponding pdf
    file to a full reveal website

VERSION

    version 20251224.1500

SYNOPSIS

    beamer-reveal.pl [--help | -h] [--man|-m] [--test|-t] <jobname>

DESCRIPTION

    The beamer-reveal.pl script reads a beamer-reveal (.rvl) driver file
    together with the .pdf file (both generated by LaTeX) and converts
    beamer slides to a working reveal website.

    Starting by reading the documentation of the LaTeX package makes sense.
    We recommend reading this documentation after that.
