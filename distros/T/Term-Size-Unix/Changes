Revision history for Perl extension Term::Size::Unix.

0.205 2008-02-27
        - disabled prototypes in XS code - too misleading
          to be useful
        - borrowed rewritten test from Term::Size::Any
          (which should fix most test failures)
        - NOTE: this distribution will disappear soon,
          merging back to the original Term-Size dist

0.204 2006-09-13
        - included license in Makefile.PL

0.203 2006-05-21
	- moved sources from Term-Size to this distribution
	- bug fixed: &pixels always used fd 0 rather than fileno(f)
	- added test scripts "t/00_use.t" and "t/99_pod.t"

0.202 2006-05-19  Term-Size
	- inserted a note to say this is an UNOFFICIAL distribution

0.201 2006-05-18  Term-Size
	- 'test.pl' rewritten with Test::More and renamed to 't/01_basic.t'
	- an initializer is now used when creating a struct winsize
	  to avoid what looks like a bug on Cygwin: ioctl(., TIOCGWINSZ, .)
	  does not set ws_xpixel and ws_ypixel fields, leaving them untouched.
	  If they contained garbage, they kept the garbage
	- attempt to restore AIX compatibility according to suggestion
	  in CPAN RT #11539 (by jydawg [at] xs4all.nl): "termios.h" 
	  is not where Unix thinks it should

0.2 1997-05-13  Term-Size
	- support filehandle arguments

0.1 1997-04-23  Term-Size
