    Unexpected - Localised exception classes composed from roles

Synopsis

       package YourApp::Exception;
    
       use Moo;
    
       extends 'Unexpected';
       with    'Unexpected::TraitFor::ErrorLeader';
    
       __PACKAGE__->ignore_class( 'YourApp::IgnoreMe' );
    
       has '+class' => default => __PACKAGE__;
    
       package YourApp;
    
       use YourApp::Exception;
       use Try::Tiny;
    
       sub some_method {
          my $self = shift;
    
          try   { this_will_fail }
          catch { YourApp::Exception->throw $_ };
       }
    
       # OR
    
       sub some_method {
          my $self = shift;
    
          eval { this_will_fail };
          YourApp::Exception->throw_on_error;
       }
    
       # THEN
       try   { $self->some_method() }
       catch { warn $_->message };

Description

    An exception class that supports error messages with placeholders, a
    throw method with automatic re-throw upon detection of self,
    conditional throw if an exception was caught and a simplified stack
    trace in addition to the error message with full stack trace

Configuration and Environment

    Applies exception roles to the exception base class Unexpected. See
    "Dependencies" for the list of roles that are applied

    The list of signatures recognised by the constructor method is
    implemented by the signature parser

    Error objects are overloaded to stringify to the full error message
    plus a leader if the optional Unexpected::TraitFor::ErrorLeader role
    has been applied

Subroutines/Methods

 BUILD

    Empty subroutine which is modified by the applied roles

 BUILDARGS

    Differentiates different constructor method signatures

Diagnostics

    String overload is performed in this class as opposed to the stringify
    error role since overloading is not supported in Moo::Role

Dependencies

    namespace::autoclean

    Unexpected::TraitFor::TracingStacks

Incompatibilities

    There are no known incompatibilities in this module

Bugs and Limitations

    Throwable did not let me use the stack trace filter directly, it's
    wrapped inside an attribute constructor. There was nothing else in
    Throwable that would not have been overridden

    There are no known bugs in this module. Please report problems to
    http://rt.cpan.org/NoAuth/Bugs.html?Dist=Unexpected. Patches are
    welcome
