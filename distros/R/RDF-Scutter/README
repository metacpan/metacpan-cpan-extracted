RDF-Scutter version 0.1
=======================

As the name implies, this is an RDF Scutter. A scutter is a web robot
that follows C<seeAlso>-links, retrieves the content it finds at those
URLs, and adds the RDF statements it finds there to its own store of
RDF statements.

It is a LWP::RobotUA, inheriting all the abilities of that class,
including the ability to be nice to remote servers, heeding robots.txt
and so on. Also, it uses the excellent and widespread RDF::Redland
library and builds a Model, which again can be used by other tools. It
can store the retrieved data in any store that can do contexts that is
supported by Redland, file, memory, Berkeley DB, MySQL, etc.

It supports most of http://rdfweb.org/topic/ScutterVocab and adds such
statements to the model. For now, it is pretty much a single-run
robot, as a second run will just start over.

It also depends on LWP, but it is not known to the author if it has
version-specific dependencies.
