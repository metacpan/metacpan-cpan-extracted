                    DESCRIPTION
                    ===========

        Date::Spoken::German is a perl module that helps you convert
        date values given as integers or unix timestamps into their
        text representation as spoken in german language. E.g. the
        7.5.2003 is converted to "siebter Mai zweitausenddrei".

                    INSTALL
                    =======

        To install Date::Spoken::German simply change to the directory
        into which you extracted the module source and type
                perl Makefile.PL
                make
                make install
        After that the module should be installed and useable. You can
        then get help by typing "perldoc Date::Spoken::German".
        
        Note for windows users: use "nmake" instead of "make" to install
        Date::Spoken::German.
        
        Just for convenience I've added two install scripts. The first one,
        install.sh, is for *nix systems with a /bin/sh, the second one,
        install.cmd, for windows system. They don't do anything more than
        explained above, install.sh uses "make" and install.cmd calls
        "nmake".
