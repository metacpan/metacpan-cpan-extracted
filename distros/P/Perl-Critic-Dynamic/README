NAME
    Perl::Critic::Dynamic - Non-static policies for Perl::Critic

AFFILIATION
    This module has no functionality, but instead contains documentation for
    this distribution and acts as a means of pulling other modules into a
    bundle. All of the Policy modules contained herein will have an
    "AFFILIATION" section announcing their participation in this grouping.

DESCRIPTION
    Perl::Critic is primarily used as a static source code analyzer, which
    means that it never compiles or executes any of the code that it
    examines. But since Perl is a dynamic language, there are certain types
    of problems that cannot be discovered until the code is actually
    compiled.

    This distribution includes Perl::Critic::DynamicPolicy, which can be
    used as a base class for Policies that wish to compile the code they
    analyze. The distribution also contains
    Perl::Critic::Policy::Dynamic::ValidateAgainstSymbolTable which
    demonstrates the use of Perl::Critic::DynamicPolicy.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
    Development of the "Perl-Critic-Dynamic" distribution was financed by a
    grant from The Mathworks (<http://mathworks.com>). The Perl::Critic team
    sincerely thanks The Mathworks for their generous support of the Perl
    community and open-source software.
