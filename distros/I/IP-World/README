IP::World is Copyright (C) 2010, Craig MacKenna <craig@animalhead.com>

DESCRIPTION

  IP::World returns the ISO-3166 country code associated with an IP4 
  address.  It uses a free database from WIPmania.com. The free database
  it used to use from MaxMind.com has been discontinued.
  
  The included application 'maint_ip_world_db' checks whether the 
  included IP::World database needs updating during installation, and 
  can be run or scheduled to keep it current.  WIPmania.com releases
  new source data bimonthly. On a server, 'maint_ip_world_db' can be
  scheduled (cron'ed on Unix/Linux) to run at an unbusy time.

INSTALLATION

  During the installation you will be asked if you want to enter a 
  command for 'maint_ip_world_db' to run when the database is updated.  
  (The author enters a command to restart his Apache server at this point.)  
  If you don't want to use this feature, just hit Return.

  Easy ways to install IP::World:

    $ perl -MCPAN -e "install IP::World"
    
    OR
    
    $ perl -MCPANPLUS -e 'fetch IP::World'

  The classic way:

    Choose a directory to use for installing.
    Move/download the distribution file IP-World-n.nn.tar.gz into that directory
    cd into the directory
    $ tar -xf IP-World-n.nn.tar.gz

    This will produce a new directory IP-World-n.n.

    $ cd IP-World-n.n
    $ perl Build.PL
    $ ./Build
    $ ./Build test

    Assuming those steps don't show any problems:

    $ sudo ./Build install  (or just ./Build install if you're superuser)
    
  Windows users can omit the './' and just type Build.

  Either of the above alternatives should install IP::World into the
  Perl library.
  
  See the POD documentation for further details. Once the module
  is installed, you should be able to read the documentation by
  typing the following from the command-line:

    $ perldoc IP::World

  Or if your man system is configured in a compatible way:

    $ man IP::World

NOTES
    
    This module requires perl 5.7.3 or later.

    The author uses it for customizing web pages on his server to the 
    location of the visitor, particularly to quote prices of items 
    for sale in the visitor's currency.  Also for server log analysis.
