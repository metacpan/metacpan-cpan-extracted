Version 0.015 - 2025-12-22
  - Fix 5.8 and C89 compatibility

Version 0.014 - 2025-12-22
  - Fix MULTIPLICITY (ithreads) support

Version 0.013 - 2025-12-21
  - New method $span->cmp($other) is like memcmp but on Unicode codepoints
  - Span objects now also have overloaded cmp, stringify, and boolean cast
  - New PEM parser class

Version 0.012 - 2025-12-19
  - String patterns passed to scanning functions (scan, index, rindex, and
    various methods of Span) can now be perl unicode strings, or SecretBuffer
    objects, or Span objects (with their own encoding) and matches will be
    compared codepoint by codepoint.
  - Added BASE64 encoding
  - New exportable memcmp function, and method of SecretBuffer and Span objects
  - Exceptions in unmask_to and unmask_secrets_to now pass through to caller
    more correctly.
  - SecretBuffer overloads 'cmp' with the new memcmp function, so you can now
    compare buffers directly with cmp, lt, gt, eq and so on.
    (Span objects do not, yet, to avoid the complicated question of how best to
     compare mismatched encodings)
  - Fix debug-build-perl asertion failure in Span->copy_to when copying from
    buffer of capacity=0

Version 0.011 - 2025-12-02
  - Fix bug in parsing strings of '$encoding' parameters that could return
    an uninitialized value for an invalid encoding.
  - Fix compatibility of tests for Win32 and Cygwin

Version 0.010 - 2025-11-22
  - Fix bug where substr with replacement that shrinks the buffer would leave
    un-wiped bytes at the end of the string.
  - Fix compile error on BSD, possibly others
  - New methods: splice, append
  - substr, splice, append, and assign now all have special cases for assigning
    a Span of a buffer.
  - New C API functions:
     - secret_buffer_SvPVbyte
     - secret_buffer_splice
     - secret_buffer_splice_sv
  - Removed the short-lived secret_buffer_assign_sv from the previous release
    since secret_buffer_splice_sv provides a more powerful way to do it.
  - C API is now exported as package variables for simpler conditional use of
    the API, such as
    get_sv("Crypt::SecretBuffer::C_API::void secret_buffer_wipe(char *, size_t)",0);
  - Standardized signatures of exported functions in these variables
  - Removed the macros
      SECRET_BUFFER_DECLARE_FUNCTION_POINTERS,
      SECRET_BUFFER_DEFINE_FUNCTION_POINTERS, and
      SECRET_BUFFER_DEFINE_FUNCTION_POINTERS
    because I'm pretty sure they'll never get used, and so now SecretBuffer.h
    doesn't need to include SecretBufferManualLinkage.h and the user can just
    copy SecretBuffer.h as-is from the git repo.

Version 0.008 - 2025-11-17
  - New Span objects assist with parsing secrets.
  - New INI object for parsing common INI-like formats.
  - SecretBuffer now has 'rindex' and 'scan' methods, and 'index' allows the
    pattern to be a Regexp-ref as long as it is only a single character class.
  - New SecretBuffer methods load_file and save_file.
  - New C API functions:
     - secret_buffer_charset_from_regexpref
     - secret_buffer_charset_test_byte
     - secret_buffer_charset_test_codepoint
     - secret_buffer_parse_init
     - secret_buffer_match
     - secret_buffer_match_charset
     - secret_buffer_match_bytestr
     - secret_buffer_sizeof_transcode
     - secret_buffer_transcode
     - secret_buffer_assign_sv

Version 0.007 - 2025-10-31
  - New API unmask_secrets_to and ->unmask_to
  - Documented ways to use SecretBuffer without depending on it

Version 0.006 - 2025-09-09
  - Fix bug checking errno for EAGAIN after failed _append_random
  - Fix Makefile.PL feature tests for required lib linker flags
  - Fix Win32 compat when wincrypt.h isn't required/available

Version 0.004 - 2025-06-05
  - Add "Inline with => Crypt::SecretBuffer" support
  - Tooling now provides C API from the XS shared lib as native exported symbols
  - Fix failing assertion in substr()

Version 0.003 - 2025-05-23
  - Make attribute accessor for stringify_mask
    Also allows stringify_mask to be specified in the constructor

Version 0.002 - 2025-05-23

Version 0.001 - 2025-05-23
