NAME

    Printer::Thermal - Interface for Thermal and some dot-matrix and
    inkjet Printers that support ESC-POS specification (Deprecated) - Use
    Printer::ESCPOS instead

VERSION

    version 0.29

SYNOPSIS

       use Printer::Thermal;
     
       #For Network Printers $port is 9100 in most cases but might differ depending on how you have configured your printer
       $printer = Printer::Thermal->new(device_ip=>$printer_ip,device_port=>$port);
     
       #These commands won't actually send anything to the printer but it will store all the merged data including control codes to send to printer in $printer->print_string variable.
       $printer->write("Blah Blah \nReceipt Details\nFooter");
       $printer->bold_on();
       $printer->write("Bold Text");
       $printer->bold_off();
       $printer->print(); ##Sends the above set of code to the printer. Clears the buffer text in module.
     
       #For local printer connected on serial port, check syslog(Usually under /var/log/syslog) for what device file was created for your printer when you connect it to your system(For plug and play printers).
       my $path = '/dev/ttyACM0';
       $printer = Printer::Thermal->new(serial_device_path=$path);
       $printer->write("Blah Blah \nReceipt Details\nFooter");
       $printer->bold_on();
       $printer->write("Bold Text");
       $printer->bold_off();
       $printer->print();
     
       #For local printer connected on usb port, check syslog(Usually under /var/log/syslog) for what device file was created for your printer when you connect it to your system(For plug and play printers).
       my $path = '/dev/usb/lp0';
       $printer = Printer::Thermal->new(usb_device_path=$path);
       $printer->write("Blah Blah \nReceipt Details\nFooter");
       $printer->bold_on();
       $printer->write("Bold Text");
       $printer->bold_off();
       $printer->print();

DESCRIPTION

    This Module is deprecated in favour of Printer::ESCPOS, which is the
    shiny new successor to this module. Printer::Thermal will continue to
    work and might receive occasional support and bug fixes but no new
    features. Read the See Also section for reasons on why I deprecated
    Printer::Thermal in favour of a new namespace instead of upgrading
    the existing module. For those who are already using
    Printer::Thermal, have simple needs and are happy with what this
    module provides, they can avoid the switch to Printer::ESCPOS as that
    module does not have a interface compatible with Printer::Thermal and
    might involve some work switching over. If you are starting a new
    project or if you want the support for brand new features like
    printing logos etc., then you must use Printer::ESCPOS.

ATTRIBUTES

 usb_device_path

    This variable contains the path for the printer device file when
    connected as a usb device on UNIX-like systems. I haven't added
    support for Windows and it probably wont work in doz as a local
    printer without some modifications. Feel free to try it out and let
    me know what happens. This must be passed in the constructor

 serial_device_path

    This variable contains the path for the printer device file when
    connected as a serial device on UNIX-like systems. I haven't added
    support for Windows and it probably wont work in doz as a local
    printer without some modifications. Feel free to try it out and let
    me know what happens. This must be passed in the constructor

 device_ip

    Contains the IP address of the device when its a network printer. The
    module creates IO:Socket::INET object to connect to the printer. This
    can be passed in the constructor.

 device_port

    Contains the network port of the device when its a network printer.
    The module creates IO:Socket::INET object to connect to the printer.
    This can be passed in the constructor.

 baudrate

    When used as a local serial device you can set the baudrate of the
    printer too. Default (38400) will usually work, but not always.

    This param may be specified when creating printer object to make sure
    it works properly.

    $printer = Printer::Thermal->new(serial_device_path =>
    '/dev/ttyACM0', baudrate => 9600);

 read_char_time

    *DECRECATED*

 read_const_time

    *DECRECATED*

 black_threshold

    Black ink threshold, This param may be specified when creating the
    printer object. Default is 48.

 alpha_threshold

    Alpha threshold, This param may be specified when creating the
    printer object. Default is 127.

 heatTime

    Heating time to set for Supported Thermal Printers, this affects dot
    intensity.

    This param may be specified when creating the printer object. Default
    is 120

 heatInterval

    This param may be specified when creating the printer object. Default
    is 50

 heatingDots

    This param may be specified when creating the printer object. Default
    is 7

 printer

    This is the direct device handle to the printer, You must almost
    never use this. Unless you are hacking through the module. If you are
    using this you must send me a bug report on why you had to use this.

    You can access it with $printer->printer

 print_string

    This contains the string in the module buffer that will be sent to
    the printer when you call $printer->print();

    my $print_string = $printer->print_string

 font

    Set ESC-POS Font

 underline

    Set/unset underline property

 emphasized

    Set/unset emphasized property

 double_height

    set unset double height property

 double_width

    set unset double width property

METHODS

 print

    $printer->print() Sends the accumulated commands to the printer. All
    commands below need to be followed by a print() to send the data from
    buffer to the printer. You may call more than one printer command and
    then call print to send them all to printer together. The following
    bunch of commands print a text to a printer, move down one line, and
    cut the receipt paper.

        $printer->write("hello Printer\n");
        $printer->linefeed();
        $printer->cutpaper();
        $printer->print(); # Sends the all the commands before this to the printer in one go. 

 write

    $printer->write("some text\n") Writes a bunch of text that you pass
    here to the module buffer. Note that this will not be passed to the
    printer till you call $printer->print()

 left_margin

    $printer->left_margin($nl,$nh) Sets the left margin code to the
    printer. takes two single byte parameters, $nl and $nh. To determine
    the value of these two bytes, use the INT and MOD conventions. INT
    indicates the integer (or whole number) part of a number, while MOD
    indicates the remainder of a division operation. For example, to
    break the value 520 into two bytes, use the following two equations:
    nH = INT 520/256 nL = MOD 520/256

 reset

    Resets the printer

 right_side_character_spacing

    Takes a one byte number, spacing as a parameter

 horiz_tab

    Adds a horizontal tab character like a \t to the print string.

 line_spacing

    Allows you to set the line spacing for the printer.

 linefeed

    Sends a new line character, i.e carriage return and line feed

 justify

    $alignment can be either 'L','C' or 'R' for left center and right
    justified printing

 bold_off

    Turns bold printing off

 bold_on

    Turns bold printing on

 doublestrike_off

    Turns doublestrike on characters off

 doublestrike_on

    Turns doublestrike on characters on

 emphasize_off

    Turns off emphasize(read ESC-POS documentation)

 emphasize_on

    Turns on emphasize(read ESC-POS documentation)

 font_size

    Defined Region 0 <= n <= 255 However, 1 <= vertical direction
    magnification ratio <= 8, 1 <= horizontal direction magnification
    ratio <= 8 Initial Value n=0 Function Specifies the character size
    (magnification ratio in the vertical and horizontal directions).

 font_size_esc

    Set ESC specified font size

        $printer->font_size_esc($size);

 font_b

    Switches printing to font b

 font_a

    Switches printing to font a

 underline_off

    Switches off underline

 underline_on

    Switches on underline

 inverse_off

    Switches off inverse text

 inverse_on

    Switches on inverse text

 barcode_height

    Sets barcode height

 print_barcode

    $printer->print_barcode($type,$string) Prints barcode

 print_text

    $printer->print_text($msg,$chars_per_line); Prints some text defined
    by msg. If chars_per_line is defined, inserts newlines after the
    given amount. Use normal '\n' line breaks for empty lines.

 print_bitmap

    To be done: This function is not implemented yet.

 color_1

    Prints in first color for dual color printers

 color_2

    Prints in second color for dual color printers

 cutpaper

    Cuts the paper. Most Thermal receipt printers support the facility to
    cut the receipt using this command once printing is done.

 open_cash_drawer

    Opens the Cash Drawer connected to the thermal printer.

 test

    Prints a bunch of test strings to see if your printer is working
    fine/connected properly. Don't worry if some things like emphasized
    and double strike looks the same, it happened with my printer too.

NOTES

      * If the printer prints out garbled characters instead of proper
      text, try specifying the baudrate parameter when creating printer
      object when you create the printer object(not for network or USB
      printers)

         $printer = Printer::Thermal->new(serial_device_path => '/dev/ttyACM0', baudrate => 9600);

USAGE

      * This Module offers a object oriented interface to ESC-POS
      Printers.

      * Create a printer object by providing parameters for one of the
      three types of printers supported.

      * then call formatting options or write() text to printer object in
      sequence.

      * Then call the print() method to dispatch the sequences from the
      module buffer to the printer.

    Note: While you may call print() after every single command code,
    this is not advisable as some printers tend to choke up if you send
    them too many commands too quickly.

SEE ALSO

    Printer::ESCPOS is the new module that will take over the Perl
    support for ESC-POS receipt printers. Why did I choose to deprecate
    Printer::Thermal for Printer::ESCPOS instead of upgrading it? Read on
    if you are curious

      * When I started writing Printer::Thermal I was working with
      Thermal printers for my own requirements and wanted to write
      something that would work with all Thermal Printers. As I
      discovered after a couple of releases of Printer::Thermal, the
      ESC-POS specification is a broad command specification for POS
      printers and it has nothing to do with the print technology itself
      thermal or others, so the name of the module was a big misnomer and
      it led to lot of confusion as to question of what the module was
      actually for.

      * Printer::Thermal module was only intended for supporting thermal
      printers but it worked quiet well with other printer types. The way
      receipt printers work there was no reason to have a module
      specifically for thermal printers. So this Printer::Thermal name
      started to make me uneasy.

      * There are those have minimal printing needs from their POS
      printers, they are already using Printer::Thermal and are happy
      with it. There is no reason for them to switch over unless they
      start a new project. For newer users it makes sense to start with a
      module that will have future supports and adds a wider range of
      flexible functions for ESC-POS Printers.

      * Last but not the least important reason, I wanted to make two
      things user-expandable: Printer connection(USB, Serial, Network
      etc.) and Printer Model Profiles(As I discovered that while most
      printer had more or less common command codes, They all had their
      own feature sets which borrowed most commands from a subset of
      ESCPOS. So I wanted users to be able to create their own profiles
      of supported commands to allow community effort for expansion of
      module functionality. Adding these two to existing module would
      have broken backward compatibility. Printer::ESCPOS will have
      better interfaces for users to add their own connection types and
      printer profiles.
