NAME
    Image::Grab - Perl module to easily grab images from the 'net.

Behavior Changes:
    Since 1.1, I've made Image::Grab look for background images. This could
    cause you problems if the background images match your regexps or if you use
    indexes.

    Since 0.9.5, I've added the search_url method in lieu of overloading regexp.
    This means that you'll have to check your scripts.

    Since 0.9.3, I've added the do_posix method and changed the behavior so that
    POSIX date substitution is only done if do_posix is set. This is because
    strftime appears to garble the 128th character and on in long string
    substitutions. I've seen this in Digital Unix, Linux and Solaris.

Installation:
    You must have the following modules already installed:

      Digest::MD5 2.07
      HTML::Parser 2.20
      HTML::Tree 0.51
      MIME::Base64 2.11
      URI 1.02
      libnet 1.0606
      libwww-perl 5.43

    (Earlier versions of some packages may work, but I haven't tested them.)

      $ perl Makefile.PL
      $ make test
      $ make install

    And that should do it. Let me know of any problems (<mah@everybody.org>)

Testing:
    Unless you have cookies for www.chron.com, the cookies.t test will be
    skipped. The tests rely on cookies being set in your ~/.netscape/cookies
    file. You could set these yourself by visiting the Huston Chronicle website
    (http://www.chron/content/comics) and getting an account. If you don't do
    this, these tests won't even run.

    If you are testing this from behind a firewall, be sure that your proxy
    environment variables are set correctly (e.g.
    http_proxy=http://wwwproxy:80/).

Response:
    If you care to, let me know how you are using this module. It's nice to know
    what different people are using this for.
