NAME

    OTRS::OPM::Maker::Command::sopm - Build .sopm file based on metadata

VERSION

    version 1.43

DESCRIPTION

    SOPM files are used for OTRS addon creation. They define some metadata
    like the vendor, their URL, packages required or required Perl modules.
    It is an XML file and it's no fun to create it. It not uncommon that
    the list of files included in the addon is not updated before the addon
    is built and released.

    That's why this package exists. You can define the metadata and stuff
    like database changes in a JSON file and the file list is created
    automatically. And you don't have to write the XML tags repeatedly.

INSTALLATION PHASES

    When an OTRS addon is installed, it happens in several phases

    1 CodeInstall - type "pre"

    2 DatabaseInstall - type "pre"

    3 Files are installed

    4 Include SysConfig

    5 DatabaseInstall - type "post"

    6 CodeInstall - type "post"

    These types are important in some cases and you'll see them later.

CONFIGURATION

    You can configure this command with a JSON file.

 A simple add on

    This configuration file defines only the metadata.

     {
        "name": "Test",
        "version": "0.0.3",
        "framework": [
            "3.0.x"
        ],
        "vendor": {
            "name":  "Perl-Services.de",
            "url": "http://www.perl-services.de"
        },
        "license": "GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 3, November 2007",
        "description" : {
            "en": "Test sopm command"
        }
     }

    And this .sopm will be created (assuming the file exists)

      <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
      <otrs_package version="1.0">
        <!-- GENERATED WITH OTRS::OPM::Maker::Command::sopm (1.27) -->
        <Name>Test</Name>
        <Version>0.0.3</Version>
        <Framework>3.0.x</Framework>
        <Vendor>Perl-Services.de</Vendor>
        <URL>http://www.perl-services.de</URL>
        <Description Lang="en">Test sopm command</Description>
        <License>GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 3, November 2007</License>
        <Filelist>
            <File Permission="644" Location="01_simple_json.t" />
            <File Permission="644" Location="02_intro.t" />
        </Filelist>
      </otrs>

 Support more than one framework version

    If the module runs on several framework version, you can define them in
    the list of frameworks

        "framework": [
            "3.0.x",
            "3.1.x",
            "3.2.x",
            "3.2.x"
        ],

    And they will all be listed in the .sopm

        <Framework>3.0.x</Framework>
        <Framework>3.1.x</Framework>
        <Framework>3.2.x</Framework>
        <Framework>3.3.x</Framework>

 Required packages and modules

    Some addons depend on other addons and/or Perl modules. So it has to
    define those prerequesits.

        "requires": {
            "package" : {
                "TicketOverviewHooked" : "3.2.1"
            },
            "module" : {
                "Digest::MD5" : "0.01"
            }
        },

    Creates those tags

        <PackageRequired Version="3.2.1">TicketOverviewHooked</PackageRequired>
        <ModuleRequired Version="0.01">Digest::MD5</ModuleRequired>
