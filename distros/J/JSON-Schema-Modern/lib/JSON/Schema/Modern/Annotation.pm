=head1 NAME

JSON::Schema::Modern::Annotation - Contains a single annotation from a JSON Schema evaluation

=head1 VERSION

version 0.512

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use JSON::Schema::Modern;
  my $js = JSON::Schema::Modern->new;
  my $result = $js->evaluate($data, $schema);
  my @annotations = $result->annotations;

  my $value = $annotations[0]->annotation;
  my $instance_location = $annotations[0]->instance_location;

  my $annotations_encoded = encode_json(\@annotations);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

An instance of this class holds one annotation from evaluating a JSON Schema with
L<JSON::Schema::Modern>.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 keyword

The keyword that produced the annotation.

=head2 instance_location

The path in the instance where the annotation was produced; encoded as per the JSON Pointer
specification (L<RFC 6901|https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6901>).

=head2 keyword_location

The schema path taken during evaluation to arrive at the annotation; encoded as per the JSON Pointer
specification (L<RFC 6901|https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6901>).

=head2 absolute_keyword_location

The canonical URI or URI reference of the location in the schema where the error occurred; not
defined, if there is no base URI for the schema and no C<$ref> was followed. Note that this is not
actually fragmentless URI in most cases, as the indicated error will occur at a path
below the position where the most recent identifier had been declared in the schema. Further, if the
schema never declared an absolute base URI (containing a scheme), this URI won't be absolute either.

=head2 annotation

The actual annotation value (which may or may not be a string).

=head1 METHODS

=head2 TO_JSON

Returns a data structure suitable for serialization. Corresponds to one output unit as specified in
L<https://json-schema.org/draft/2019-09/json-schema-core.html#rfc.section.10.4.2> and
L<https://json-schema.org/draft/2019-09/output/schema>, except that C<instanceLocation> and
C<keywordLocation> are json pointers, B<not> URI fragments. (See the
C<strict_basic> L<JSON::Schema::Modern/output_format>
if the distinction is important to you.)
