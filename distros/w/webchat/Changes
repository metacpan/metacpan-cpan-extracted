  interoperability with Inline::Webchat

   Release ???
   
   Patched WWW::Chat to require params to passed to make 
   it package safe although it will default to searching 
   the main:: namespace. Wrote WWW::Chat::Processor to 
   perform the job of webchatpp in a more portable way
   and rewrote webchatpp.PL (which generates webchatpp)
   to take this into account. Wrote some automatic tests
   and some ones to be run manually.
