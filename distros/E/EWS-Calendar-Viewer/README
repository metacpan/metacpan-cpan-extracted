NAME
    EWS::Calendar::Viewer - View Your MS Exchange Calendar as a Standalone
    Web App

VERSION
    version 1.111982

SYNOPSIS
    I recommend you use something like App::BundleDeps to deploy this under
    a fastcgi server environment. Configure the application like so:

     privacy_level = limited
     start_of_week = 1
 
     <Model::EWSClient>
         <args>
             server   = myserver.example.com
             username = oliver
             password = s3kr1t # or in EWS_PASS environment variable
         </args>
     </Model::EWSClient>

    And then start the Catalyst application, perhaps using one of the
    bundled server scripts.

CONFIGURATION
  privacy_level
    This can be set to "public" to show only your free/busy status,
    "limited" to show the title of the event as well, or "private" to show
    all details of the event in a tooltip.

  start_of_week
    Set this to a number from 0 to 6 representing Sunday through to Saturday
    respectively.

  EWS Client
    You'll need to set the server fully qualified domain name, and username
    for the calendar's account. The password can be set in the file using
    the "password" option or via the environment variable "EWS_PASS".

    If the Exchange server uses NTLM Negotiated Auth then also pass the
    following:

     <Model::EWSClient>
         <args>
             use_negotiated_auth = 1
         </args>
     </Model::EWSClient>

    Obviously, this setting is in addition to the other "args" mentioned
    above. If you're unsure whether NTLM is required, try it without and if
    you get an "Error: Unauthorised" response then you probably need the
    setting.

QUICK START SCRIPT
    This application brings with it a lightweight web server environment, so
    you can get up and running quickly. First, install the module and its
    dependencies.

    Then create a configuration file as in the "SYNOPSIS" section, above,
    and save it in your current directory as
    "ews_calendar_viewer_local.conf". Finally, run the
    "ews_calendar_viewer_server.pl" script. It listens on port 3000 by
    default but you can change that (see "--help"):

     $> EWS_PASS=s3kr1t ews_calendar_viewer_server.pl
     [info] EWS::Calendar::Viewer powered by Catalyst 5.80032
     You can connect to your server at http://localhost:3000
