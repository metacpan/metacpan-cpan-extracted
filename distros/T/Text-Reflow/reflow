# Usage: reflow [-skipto stuff] [-fast|-slow|-veryslow] [-skipindented] src>out
#
# Uses Knuth's paragraphing algorithm (as used in TeX) to "reflow"
# text files by picking "good" places to break the line. 
#
# It takes an ascii text file (with paragraphs separated by blank lines)
# and reflows the paragraphs. If two or more lines in a row are "indented"
# then they are assumed to be a quoted poem and are passed through unchanged.
# (The -skipindented causes ALL indented lines to be passed unchanged)
#
# The "reflow" operation tries to keep the lines the same length but also
# tries to break at punctuation, and avoid breaking within a proper name
# or after certain "connectives" ("a", "the", etc.).
#
# The "-veryslow" option reflows each paragraph 16 times with different
# optimal line widths and picks the "best" result -- with this option
# the paragraphs are easier to read, but the line width may vary from
# one paragraph to the next.
#
#
# Recent version history:
# 5.1: Fixed a bug with hyphens at end of lines
#      (caught by check-punct!)
# 5.2: Avoid turning ". . ." into ".  .  ."
# 5.3: Added an option "-skipto stuff"
#      which skips lines up to and including a line starting with "stuff"
# 5.4: Added an option "-skipindented" which treats ALL indented lines
#      as "poetry" (i.e. not reflow-ed), rather than requiring two
#      indented lines.
# 5.5: Fixed a bug when a paragraph starts with "--"
# 5.6: Tweaked some parameters, and modified to break before rather
#      than after a word which starts with an opening parenthesis
# 5.7: Delete spaces at the end of lines in output.
# 5.8: Added an option "-slow" which tries a list of "optimum" line lengths,
#      picking the one which gives the least total penalties.
# 5.9: Tweaked the parameters a bit more!
# 6.0: Added a "-veryslow" option which uses a LONG list of "optimum" lengths,
#      -veryslow is about 7 times slower than with no options (or -fast)
# 6.1: Added a penalty for paragraphs with 1 or 2 words on the last line.
# 6.2: Fixed a bug in calculating $bestsofar.
# 6.3: Modified to work with perl5beta1 (gaining a 20% speed improvement).
# 6.4: Added "-w" and fixed warnings and a bug with v long first word in para.
# 6.5: Fix 5.1 could leave @linewords empty
#      -- check for hyphen at end of line before checking @linewords
# 6.6: Trim spaces from the ends of lines before printing.
# 6.7: Tweaked "optimum" parameters and reduced maximum to 75
# 6.8: Speed optimisations, including converting all penalties to integers
#      -- now 37% faster on -veryslow
# 7.0: Converted to a module with an XSUB for reflow_trial
#      -- Vast speed improvement!

=head1 NAME

reflow - Perl script for reflowing text files using Knuth's 
paragraphing algorithm.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

reflow < input > output

reflow file1 file2 ... > output

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Uses Knuth's paragraphing algorithm (as used in TeX) to "reflow"
text files by picking "good" places to break the line.

It takes an ascii text file (with paragraphs separated by blank lines)
and reflows the paragraphs. If two or more lines in a row are "indented"
then they are assumed to be a quoted poem and are passed through unchanged.
(The -skipindented causes ALL indented lines to be passed unchanged)

The algorithm tries to keep the lines the same length but also
tries to break at punctuation, and avoid breaking within a proper name
or after certain "connectives" ("a", "the", etc.).

=head2 OPTIONS

=over 5

=item B<-skipindented>

Cause ALL indented lines to be passed unchanged. Normally a single indented
line is included in the paragraph, while two or more indented lines
are considered to be a quotation or poem and are passed through unchanged.

=item B<-fast>

Sets the optimum line width to 65 characters. This is the default.

=item B<-slow>

Tries line widths of 60, 65 and 70 characters and picks the best one.

=item B<-veryslow>

Tries all line widths between 60 and 70 characters inclusive,
and picks the best one. With the B<-slow> and B<-veryslow> options
the line widths within a paragraph will vary less,
but the line widths may vary from one paragraph to the next.

=item B<-skipto pattern>

Skip to the first line starting with the given pattern before starting
to reflow.  This is useful for skipping Project Gutenberg headers
or contents tables.

See Text::Reflow(3) for more options: all the keyword options
defined in Text::Reflow are also available via the reflow script.
