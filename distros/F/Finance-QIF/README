COMMENTS

We have put together a new version of FInance::QIF. I was looking for
something that could process a complete export from Quicken. I took a
look at the original Finance::QIF currently available at CPAN and
found it could not process much of a typical Quicken QIF file. This
new version of Finance::QIF is fairly different from the existing
Finance::QIF. We have contacted the previous owner and asked for
permission to take ownership of the existing Finance::QIF. They agreed
to let us pick up the code.

This version does have different API's than the 1.X so anyone porting code
to this new version will have to make modifications to get things working.

The software is available at
