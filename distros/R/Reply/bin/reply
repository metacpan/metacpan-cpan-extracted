=head1 SYNOPSIS

  reply [-lb] [-I dir] [-M mod] [--version] [--help] [--cfg file]

This script runs the L<Reply> shell. It looks for a configuration file in
C<.replyrc> in your home directory, and will generate a basic configuration for
you if that file does not exist.

See the L<Reply> documentation for more information about using and configuring
this program.

=head1 OPTIONS

reply takes these command line options:

=over 4

=item -I lib

=item -l

=item -b

Equivalent to C<-I blib/lib -I blib/arch>.

=item -M Carp::Always

repl, so things like exporting work properly.
