DESCRIPTION
    This plugin allows you to add distributions from a list of filenames or
    uris. The list is read from a configuration file containing one
    distribution name per line.

IMPLEMENTS
    CPAN::Local::Role::Gather

ATTRIBUTES
  list
    Required. Path to the configuration file that contains the list of
    distributions. The configuration file must contain absolute paths or
    uris, unless "prefix" is specified.

  prefix
    Optional. String to prepend to each line in the configuration file. This
    is commonly the base uri of a CPAN mirror or the path to a local folder
    containing distributions. Note that the prefix is simply concatenated
    with each line in the configuration file, so be careful not to omit the
    trailing slash where needed.

  cache
    Optional. Directory where to download a remote distribution before
    adding it to the mirror. If a distribtuion from the configuartion file
    is already in the cache, it will not be downloaded again. Ignored when
    "local" is used.

  local
    Optional. Instructs the plugin that the distributions live in the local
    filesystem, so no attempt will be made to download or cache them.

  authorid
    Optional. Author id to use when injecting distributions from this list.
