          - Tests can now cache their output and be rerun without a Typesense
            server. Delete the t/cache directory to require a Typesense server
            again.
          - Consolidate the http request behavior into a single role,
            Search::Typesense::Role::Request.
          - Standardized HTTP request args in _GET, _POST, _PATCH, and _DELETE
            methods.
          - Added Perl::Critic and Perl::Tidy tests to xt/

          - No significant (non-doc) changes. The version number was bumped
            automatically by Dist::Zilla as I was trying to force a new
            release.

          - Collection and Document behaviors are now moved into their own

          - Fix dependencies in the dist.ini file. This should resolve
            https://github.com/Ovid/Search-Typesense/issues/1
          - Start a proper Test::Search::Typesense module. It's only a stub
            right now, but it simplifies some common code.
          - Lay the groundwork for more i18n tests in the future.

          - Bump hard dependency on Perl to 5.16.0
          - Make the Moo code more idiomatic
