Net-Sharktools version 0.009
============================

C<Net::Sharktools> is an adaptation of the Python interface provided with the
C<Sharktools> package which is a "small set of  tools that allow use of
Wireshark's deep packet inspection capabilities in interpreted programming
languages."

Sharktools can be obtained obtained Armen Babikyan's web site at
L<http://www.mit.edu/~armenb/sharktools/>. To use C<Net::Sharktools>, you must
first build the Sharktools C library successfully as described in the README
for the Sharktools package (the version of this file bundled with Sharktools
v.0.1.5 is included in this module for your reference).

C<Net::Sharktools> is almost a direct translation of the Python interface
C<pyshark> included with Sharktools.

INSTALLATION

Sharktools is closely coupled with the internals of Wireshark. Before
attempting to build C<Net::Sharktools>, you should ensure that you are able to
build and run the Python module C<pyshark> distributed with Sharktools. Note
that you should use C<python2> to test C<pyshark>.

The build process for Sharktools requires you to install Wireshark and also
have the full source tree for Wireshark accessible. You will need the same to
build Sharktools as well.

Currently, the C<Makefile.PL> for C<Net::Sharktools> makes no attempt to
automatically deduce the locations for your WireShark and Sharktools
distributions. You will need to edit C<Makefile.PL> to point both the compiler
and linker to the correct locations.

You can do that by specifying command line options when you generate the
Makefile:

    perl Makefile.PL --PREFIX=/install/path \
        --sharktools-src /home/user/sharktools-0.1.5/src \
        --wireshark-src /home/user/shark/wireshark-1.4.3 \
        [ --lib-path /additional/library/paths ] \
        [ --inc-path /additional/include/paths ]

--inc-path and --lib-path are array valued options, so they can be specified
multiple times on the command line.

You should definitely specify those (in addition to the Sharktools and
Wireshark source directories) if you encounter any difficulties related to
locating glib headers and/or glib and Wireshark libraries on your system.

I have use Devel::CheckLib to perform a sanity check prior to WriteMakefile
using a select few headers and libraries. If the checks fail, no Makefile will
be generated. Ensure that you have the requisite libraries installed, make sure
you have built Sharktools according to its instructions prior to attempting to
build Net::Sharktools, and specified the correct paths when invoking
Makefile.PL.

Once a Makefile is generated, you can do:

    make
    make test
    make install
