This is a basic POD example
for using M<Pod::Advent> to generate a
A<Perl Advent Calendar|http://perladvent.pm.org> entry such as this.
Once the POD is written or updated, simply execute
the F<pod2advent> script and save the output:

=begin code

$ pod2advent getting_started.pod > pod2advent getting_started.html

=end code

And we get the file that you are now reading.
The POD source is included below
(normally this would be your I<.pl> script file):

=sourcedcode getting_started.pod
