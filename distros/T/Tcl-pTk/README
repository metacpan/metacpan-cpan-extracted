NAME
    Tcl::pTk - Interface to Tcl/Tk with Perl/Tk compatible syntax

DESCRIPTION
    
    The Tcl::pTk extension (not to be confused with the "native" perl5
    Perl/Tk extension) provides a complete interface to the whole
    of Tk via the Tcl extension. It has full perl/tk compatible syntax for 
    running existing perl/tk scripts, as well as direct-tcl syntax for using any other Tcl/Tk features.
            
    See the POD documentation for more details.
    
Build in the usual way for a perl extension:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

1. Tweak Makefile.PL is necessary only if your Tcl or Tk include files could
not be found automatically by Makefile.PL script. Normally you just make
sure you have right tcl/tk in your path at a moment of running Makefile.PL
script.

2. perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make install

In some rare cases you may want to pass some parameters to Makefile.PL, but
usually defaults are good.
You can see some explanations on these parameters with

   perl Makefile.PL --help
