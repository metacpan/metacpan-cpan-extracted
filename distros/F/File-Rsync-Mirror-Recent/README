rersyncrecent / File-Rsync-Mirror-Recent

This is about speeding up rsync operation on large trees to many
places. Uses a small metadata cocktail and pull technology. Although
designed for the general purpose of mirroring large trees it's primary
goal is to get CPAN sped up (CPEEDPAN). See README.mirrorcpan for a
plan for a better CPAN backbone.
