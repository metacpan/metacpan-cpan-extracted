NAME
    MooseX::DeclareX::Plugin::abstract - shiny syntax for MooseX::ABCD

SYNOPSIS
            class Shape is abstract {
                    requires 'draw';
            }
        
            class Circle extends Shape {
                    method draw { ... }
            }
        
            class Square extends Shape {
                    # does not implement 'draw'
            } # dies
        
            my $shape  = Shape->new;  # dies
            my $circle = Circle->new; # succeeds

DESCRIPTION
    This distribution adds two new plugins to MooseX::DeclareX.

    `is abstract`
        Declares that a class cannot be instantiated.

        Also allows the standard Moose `requires` function to work within
        classes (it normally only works within roles).

        When a class requires a method, then subclasses are supposed to
        provide that method. If the subclass itself is also abstract, then it
        doesn't need to provide the required methods. (There's also a little
        cheat: classes which are mutable may extend abstract classes without
        implementing required methods. You should not do this though.)

    `is concrete`
        A counterpart to `is abstract`. Currently, this is a no-op, but in
        future it might enable some checks related to abstract classes.
