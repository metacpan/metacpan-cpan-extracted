NAME
    package::compute - stop hard-coding your package names

SYNOPSIS
       package Foo::Bar;  # this is a hard-coded package name
       use 5.010;
   
       {
          use package::compute "../Quux";
          say __PACKAGE__;              # says "Foo::Quux";
          say __RPACKAGE__("./Xyzzy");  # says "Foo::Quux::Xyzzy";
      
          sub hello { say __PACKAGE__ };
       }
   
       say __PACKAGE__;   # says "Foo::Bar" (lexically scoped!)
       Foo::Quux->hello;  # says "Foo::Quux"

DESCRIPTION
    This module allows you to compute package names on the fly at compile
    time, rather than hard-coding them as barewords. It is the solution to the
    problem (if indeed you consider it to be a problem at all) that you cannot
    write this in Perl:

       package $blah;

    This module uses B::Hooks::Parser to accomplish its evil goals.

    Using this module at all is probably a very bad idea.

  Package Specification
    The general syntax for specifying a package with this module is:

       use package::compute EXPR;

    Where EXPR is an arbitrary expression which will (caveat!) be evaluated at
    compile time, and interpreted roughly the way Perl interprets package
    names, with the following bonus features:

    *   If the package name expression is a coderef, then that coderef is
        called and the return value is used instead.

    *   Slashes may be used to separate package name components in addition to
        the usual Perl "::" and deprecated "'" package separators.

    *   The component "." at the start of the package name refers to the
        caller. ("." elsewhere is a no-op.)

    *   The component ".." climbs "up" the package hierarchy.

    *   The component "..." climbs "up" the package hierarchy by two levels.
        Et cetera.

    Thus the following are all valid ways of expressing package "Foo::Bar":

       ### 
       use package::compute "Foo::Bar";
       ####
   
       ### Using a coderef
       use package::compute sub { join q(::) qw( Foo Bar ) };
       ####
   
       #### Relative package name
       package Foo;
       use package::compute "./Bar";
       ####
   
       ### Climbing the package hierarchy
       package Foo::XXX;
       use package::compute "../Bar";
       ####
   
       ### Climbing the package hierarchy twice
       package Foo::XXX::YYY;
       use package::compute "../../Bar";
       ####
   
       ### Climbing the package hierarchy twice - shortcut
       package Foo::XXX::YYY;
       use package::compute ".../Bar";
       ####

    As a special case, you can also do:

       use package::compute -filename;

    Which will attempt to determine the package name based on the filename it
    is defined in, much like `autopackage` does.

    Also:

       use package::compute -anon;

    Will compute an "anonymous" (i.e. arbitrary) package name.

  Utility Function
    This module also exports a utility function:

    `__RPACKAGE__($name)`
        Returns a package name as a string, computed in the same way as `use
        package::compute` does. An example of its use for object-oriented
        code:

                package MyProject;
        
                {
                        use package::compute './Person';
                        use Moose;
                        has name => (is => 'ro');
                }
        
                my $bob = __RPACKAGE__('./Person')->new(name => "Robert");

        As you can see, this makes it possible to avoid hard-coded references
        to the MyProject::Person class.

        `__RPACKAGE__` doesn't support the special `-filename` and `-anon`
        options.

        It is possible to import the `__RPACKAGE__` function alone, without
        the package declaration magic using:

           use package::compute undef;
