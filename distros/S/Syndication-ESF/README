NAME
    Syndication::ESF - Create and update ESF files

SYNOPSIS
        use Syndication::ESF;

        my $esf = Syndication::ESF->new;

        $esf->parsefile( 'my.esf' );

        $esf->channel( title => 'My channel' );

        $esf->add_item(
            date  => time,
            title => 'new item',
            link  => 'http://example.org/#foo'
        );

        print "Channel: ", $esf->channel( 'title' ), "\n";
        print "Items  : ", scalar @{ $esf->{ items } }, "\n";

        my $output = $esf->as_string;

        $esf->save( 'my.esf' );

DESCRIPTION
    This module is the basic framework for creating and maintaing Epistula
    Syndication Format (ESF) files. More information on the format can be
    found at the Aquarionics web site:
    http://www.aquarionics.com/article/name/esf

    This module tries to copy the XML::RSS module's interface. All
    applicable methods have been copied and should respond in the same
    manner.

    Like in XML::RSS, channel data is accessed through the "channel()" sub,
    and item data is accessed straight out of the items array.

INSTALLATION
        perl Makefile.PL
        make
        make test
        make install

METHODS
  new()
    Creates a new Syndication::ESF object. It currently does not accept any
    parameters.

  channel(title => $title, contact => $contact, link => $link)
    Supplying no parameters will give you a reference to the channel data.
    Specifying a field name returns the value of the field. Giving it a hash
    will update the channel data with the supplied values.

  contact_name()
    shortcut to get the contact name

  contact_email()
    shortcut to get the contact email

  add_item(date => $date, title => $title, link => $link, mode => $mode)
    By default, this will append the new item to the end of the list.
    Specifying 'insert' for the "mode" parameter adds it to the front of the
    list.

  parse($string)
    Parse the supplied raw ESF data.

  parsefile($filename)
    Same as "parse()", but takes a filename as input.

  as_string()
    Returns the current data stored in the object as a string.

  save($filename)
    Saves the value of "as_string()" to the supplied filename.
