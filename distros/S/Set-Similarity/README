    Set::Similarity - similarity measures for sets

SYNOPSIS

     use Set::Similarity::Dice;
    
     # object method
     my $dice = Set::Similarity::Dice->new;
     my $similarity = $dice->similarity('Photographer','Fotograf');
    
     # class method
     my $dice = 'Set::Similarity::Dice';
     my $similarity = $dice->similarity('Photographer','Fotograf');
    
     # from 2-grams
     my $width = 2;
     my $similarity = $dice->similarity('Photographer','Fotograf',$width);
    
     # from arrayref of tokens
     my $similarity = $dice->similarity(['a','b'],['b']);
    
     # from hashref of features
     my $bird = {
       wings    => true,
       eyes     => true,
       feathers => true,
       hairs    => false,
       legs     => true,
       arms     => false,
     };
     my $mammal = {

       eyes     => true,
       feathers => false,
       hairs    => true,
       legs     => true,
       arms     => true,
     };
     my $similarity = $dice->similarity($bird,$mammal);
    
     # from arrayref sets
     my $bird = [qw(
       wings
       eyes
       feathers
       legs
     )];
     my $mammal = [qw(
       eyes

       legs
       arms
     )];

DESCRIPTION

    This is the base class including mainly helper and convenience methods.

 Overlap coefficient

    ( A intersect B ) / min(A,B)

 Jaccard Index

    The Jaccard coefficient measures similarity between sample sets, and is
    defined as the size of the intersection divided by the size of the
    union of the sample sets

    ( A intersect B ) / (A union B)

    The Tanimoto coefficient is the ratio of the number of features common
    to both sets to the total number of features, i.e.

    ( A intersect B ) / ( A + B - ( A intersect B ) ) # the same as Jaccard

    The range is 0 to 1 inclusive.

 Dice coefficient

    The Dice coefficient is the number of features in common to both sets
    relative to the average size of the total number of features present,
    i.e.

    ( A intersect B ) / 0.5 ( A + B ) # the same as sorensen

    The weighting factor comes from the 0.5 in the denominator. The range
    is 0 to 1.

METHODS

    All methods can be used as class or object methods.

 new

      $object = Set::Similarity->new();

 similarity

      my $similarity = $object->similarity($any1,$any1,$width);

    $any can be an arrayref, a hashref or a string. Strings are tokenized
    into n-grams of width $width.

    $width must be integer, or defaults to 1.

 from_tokens

      my $similarity = $object->from_tokens(['a','b'],['b']);

 from_sets

      my $similarity = $object->from_sets(['a'],['b']);

    Croaks if called directly. This method should be implemented in a child
    module.

 intersection

      my $intersection_size = $object->intersection(['a'],['b']);

 uniq

      my @uniq = $object->uniq(['a','b']);

    Transforms an arrayref of strings into an array of unique elements.

 combined_length

      my $set_size_sum = $object->combined_length(['a'],['b']);

 min

      my $min_set_size = $object->min(['a'],['b']);

 ngrams

      my @monograms = $object->ngrams('abc');
      my @bigrams = $object->ngrams('abc',2);

 _any

      my $arrayref = $object->_any($any,$width);
