NAME
    Test::JSYNC - Test JSYNC data

VERSION
    This document describes Test::JSYNC version 0.02.

SYNOPSIS
       use Test::JSYNC;

       jsync_ok $jsync,                  'jsync is well formed';
       jsync_is $jsync, $expected_jsync, 'jsync matches what we expected';

DESCRIPTION
    JSON YAML Notation Coding (JSYNC) is an extension of JSON that can
    serialize any data objects. Test::JSYNC makes it easy to verify that you
    have built valid JSYNC and that it matches your expected output.

    This module uses the JSYNC module, which is currently the only CPAN
    module to support JSYNC; however, the module itself states that it "is a
    very early release of JSYNC, and should not be used at all unless you
    know what you are doing."

EXPORTED TESTS
  jsync_ok
    Test passes if the string passed is valid JSYNC.

       jsync_ok $jsync, 'jsync is well formed';

    "is_valid_jsync" is provided as an alternative to "jsync_ok" using the
    same naming convention as Test::JSON but is not exported by default.

  jsync_is
    Test passes if the two JSYNC strings are valid JSYNC and evaluate to the
    same data structure.

       jsync_is $jsync, $expected_jsync, 'jsync matches what we expected';

    Test::Differences is used to provide easy diagnostics of why the JSYNC
    structures did not match. For example:

          Failed test 'jsync matches what we expected'
          in t/jsync.t at line 10.

        |   5|  id => '1',               |  id => '1',               |
        *   6|  name => 'foo'            |  name => 'fo'             *
        |   7|}                          |}                          |
        +----+---------------------------+---------------------------+

    "is_jsync" is provided as an alternative to "jsync_is" using the same
    naming convention as Test::JSON but is not exported by default.

SEE ALSO
    This module uses JSYNC and Test::Differences, and is based on
    Test::JSON.
