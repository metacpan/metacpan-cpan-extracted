=head1 DESCRIPTION

For end-users, please review the
[documentation](https://metacpan.org/pod/distribution/Dist-Mgr/bin/distmgr) for
the [distmgr](https://metacpan.org/pod/distribution/Dist-Mgr/bin/distmgr)
program that we've installed for you as part of this distribution.

Performs a full suite of automated creation, addition, pre-release, release and
post release tasks for Perl distributions. It integrates with VCS, automates the
configuration of Continuous Integration, manages version numbers and Changes
files, amongst a slew of other tasks.

This distribution is essentially a bunch of tools that revolve around a base
distribution created with C<module-starter>.

At this time, it relies on using L<Module::Starter> for initial distribution
creation, Github for repository and bugtracker, and the L<ExtUtils::MakeMaker>
build system, which utilizes C<Makefile.PL> files.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Dist::Mgr qw(:all)

    ...

=head1 EXPORT_OK

functionality explicitly. Use the C<:all> tag, or have a peruse through the
L</FUNCTIONS> section for what's available.
