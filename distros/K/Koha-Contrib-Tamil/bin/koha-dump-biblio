=item *

Specifiy the format of the file: ISO2709 or MARCXML.

=item *

koha-dump-biblio - Dump a Koha Catalog

=head1 SYNOPSYS

 koha-dump-biblio
 koha-dump-biblio --branch MAIN
 koha-dump-biblio --branch MAIN --branch EAST catalog.mrc
 koha-dump-biblio --branch MAIN --formater marcxml catalog.xml
 koha-dump-biblio --branch MAIN --query "SELECT biblionumber FROM items WHERE barcode LIKE 'X%' --formater marcxml catalog.xml

=head1 PARAMETERS

=over

=item B<-formater=iso2709|marcxml|text|yaml|json>

Specify the format of the file containing the exported records. You can choose
between ISO2709 format and MARCXML, but also textual formts. By default
C<iso2709>.

=item B<-branch>

Select the library of the items to be included to the exported biblio records.
You can select several libraries by repeating this parameter. For example:
B<-branch MAIN -branch EAST>. If the B<-query> parameter isn't used, the
B<-branch> parameter select also the biblio records. In other words, biblio
records without items belonging the the specifed libraries won't be exported.

=item B<-query>

This parameter contains an SQL query which select the biblio records to export
with their biblionumber.

For example:

=over

=item Select two records, biblionumber 10 and 100:

-query "SELECT 10 AS biblionumber UNION ALL SELECT 11 AS biblionumber"

=item Select records containing items which barcode start with a X:

-query "SELECT biblionumber FROM items WHERE barcode LIKE 'X%'"

=back

=item B<--verbose|-v>

Display a progress status of the export process.

=item B<--help|-h>
