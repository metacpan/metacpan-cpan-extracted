NAME

    Alien::libtool - Build or find libtool

VERSION

    version 0.15

SYNOPSIS

    In your script or module:

     use Alien::libtool;
     use Env qw( @PATH );
    
     unshift @PATH, Alien::libtool->bin_dir;

DESCRIPTION

    This distribution provides libtool so that it can be used by other Perl
    distributions that are on CPAN. It does this by first trying to detect
    an existing install of libtool on your system. If found it will use
    that. If it cannot be found, the source code will be downloaded from
    the internet and it will be installed in a private share location for
    the use of other modules.

    corresponding command. You want to use the helpers because they will
    use the correct incantation on Windows.
