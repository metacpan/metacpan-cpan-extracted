                      Release of version 0.91 of Acme::Smirch
==============================================================================

NAME
    Acme::Smirch - For *really* dirty programs

SYNOPSIS
            use Smirch;

            Smirch::smear("tooClean.pl");

DESCRIPTION
    If you have not yet seen the most clever Acme::Bleach.pm by Damian
    Conway, go see that now. The only trouble with showing off Bleach to
    your friends is that it requires Bleach to be installed on their
    machines. So here is Smirch, that does the converse of Bleach - rewrites
    your program using only non alphanumeric characters BUT it does not
    depend on any external module! That's right - complete perl without
    numbers or letters.

    After you have Smirched a program, the program continues to work as
    before except now it is absolutely unreadable as the module removes all
    *sightly* characters from your source file.

    The Smirched program has to sit in a file of its own - you cannot run a
    smirched program by piping it to perl.

    You can now reform your source to look like this:

                                              $==$';

    Valid and devious perl.

INSTALLATION

    It's all pure Perl, so just put the .pm file in its appropriate
    local Perl subdirectory.

TODO
    Smirch currently spits out perl in one line - it would be nice to have
    it reform the code automatically into pretty pictures like the above
    camel.

BUGS
    Yes.

    Smirch does not work with windows (yet?). Also, smirched programs are a
    little flakey and sadness happens when used with Bleach or anything too
    strenuous. Use is unadvisable for anything important.
