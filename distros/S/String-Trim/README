NAME
    String::Trim - trim whitespace from your strings

VERSION
    version 0.005

SYNOPSIS
        use String::Trim;

        print "Do it? ";
        trim(my $response = <>);
        print "'$response'\n";

DESCRIPTION
    "String::Trim" trims whitespace off your strings. chomp trims only $/
    (typically, that's newline), but "trim" will trim all leading and
    trailing whitespace.

FUNCTIONS
  trim
    Returns the string with all leading and trailing whitespace removed.
    Trimming undef gives you undef. Alternatively, you can trim in-place.

        my $var     = ' my string  ';
        my $trimmed = trim($var);
        # OR
        trim($var);

    "trim" also knows how to trim an array or arrayref:

        my @to_trim = (' one ', ' two ', ' three ');
        my @trimmed = trim(@to_trim);
        # OR
        trim(@to_trim);
        # OR
        my $trimmed = trim(\@to_trim);
        # OR
        trim(\@to_trim);

RATIONALE
    "trim" is often used by beginners, who may not understand how to spin
    their own. While String::Util does have a "trim" function, it depends on
    Debug::ShowStuff, which depends on Taint, which fails the test suite,
    and doesn't appear to be maintained. This module installs, is actively
    maintained, and has no non-core dependencies.

    Other options include Text::Trim and String::Strip (which is implemented
    in XS, and is therefore likely to be very fast, but requires a C
    compiler).
