NAME
    Test::Spelling - check for spelling errors in POD files

SYNOPSIS
        use Test::More;
        BEGIN {
            plan skip_all => "Spelling tests only for authors"
                unless -d 'inc/.author';
        }

        use Test::Spelling;
        all_pod_files_spelling_ok();

DESCRIPTION
    "Test::Spelling" lets you check the spelling of a POD file, and report
    its results in standard "Test::More" fashion. This module requires a
    spellcheck program such as spell, aspell, ispell, or hunspell.

        use Test::Spelling;
        pod_file_spelling_ok('lib/Foo/Bar.pm', 'POD file spelling OK');

    Note that it is a bad idea to run spelling tests during an ordinary CPAN
    distribution install, or in a package that will run in an uncontrolled
    environment. There is no way of predicting whether the word list or
    spellcheck program used will give the same results. You can include the
    test in your distribution, but be sure to run it only for authors of the
    module by guarding it in a "skip_all unless -d 'inc/.author'" clause, or
    by putting the test in your distribution's xt/ directory. Anyway, people
    installing your module really do not need to run such tests, as it is
    unlikely that the documentation will acquire typos while in transit. :-)

    You can add your own stopwords, which are words that should be ignored
    by the spell check, like so:

        add_stopwords(qw(asdf thiswordiscorrect));

    Adding stopwards in this fashion affects all files checked for the
    remainder of the test script. See Pod::Spell (which this module is built
    upon) for a variety of ways to add per-file stopwords to each .pm file.

    If you have a lot of stopwords, it's useful to put them in your test
    file's "DATA" section like so:

        use Test::Spelling;
        add_stopwords(<DATA>);
        all_pod_files_spelling_ok();

        __END__
        folksonomy
        Jifty
        Zakirov

    To maintain backwards compatibility, comment markers and some whitespace
    are ignored. In the near future, the preprocessing we do on the
    arguments to add_stopwords will be changed and documented properly.

FUNCTIONS
  all_pod_files_spelling_ok( [@files/@directories] )
    Checks all the files for POD spelling. It gathers all_pod_files() on
    each file/directory, and declares a "plan" in Test::More for you (one
    test for each file), so you must not call "plan" yourself.

    If @files is empty, the function finds all POD files in the blib
    directory if it exists, or the lib directory if it does not. A POD file
    is one that ends with .pod, .pl, .plx, or .pm; or any file where the
    first line looks like a perl shebang line.

    If there is no working spellchecker (determined by
    "has_working_spellchecker"), this test will issue a "skip all"
    directive.

    If you're testing a distribution, just create a t/pod-spell.t with the
    code in the "SYNOPSIS".

    Returns true if every POD file has correct spelling, or false if any of
    them fail. This function will show any spelling errors as diagnostics.

  pod_file_spelling_ok( FILENAME[, TESTNAME ] )
    "pod_file_spelling_ok" will test that the given POD file has no spelling
    errors.

    When it fails, "pod_file_spelling_ok" will show any spelling errors as
    diagnostics.

    The optional second argument TESTNAME is the name of the test. If it is
    omitted, "pod_file_spelling_ok" chooses a default test name "POD
    spelling for FILENAME".

  all_pod_files( [@dirs] )
    Returns a list of all the Perl files in each directory and its
    subdirectories, recursively. If no directories are passed, it defaults
    to blib if blib exists, or else lib if not. Skips any files in CVS or
    .svn directories.

    A Perl file is:

    *   Any file that ends in .PL, .pl, .plx, .pm, .pod or .t.

    *   Any file that has a first line with a shebang and "perl" on it.

    Furthermore, files for which the filter set by "set_pod_file_filter"
    return false are skipped. By default, this filter passes everything
    through.

    The order of the files returned is machine-dependent. If you want them
    sorted, you'll have to sort them yourself.

  add_stopwords(@words)
    Add words that should be skipped by the spellcheck. Note that Pod::Spell
    already skips words believed to be code, such as everything in verbatim
    (indented) blocks and code marked up with "...", as well as some common
    Perl jargon.

  has_working_spellchecker
    "has_working_spellchecker" will return "undef" if there is no working
    spellchecker, or a true value (the spellchecker command itself) if there
    is. The module performs a dry-run to determine whether any of the
    spellcheckers it can will use work on the current system. You can use
    this to skip tests if there is no spellchecker. Note that
    "all_pod_files_spelling_ok" will do this for you.

  set_spell_cmd($command)
    If you want to force this module to use a particular spellchecker, then
    you can specify which one with "set_spell_cmd". This is useful to ensure
    a more consistent lexicon between developers, or if you have an unusual
    environment. Any command that takes text from standard input and prints
    a list of misspelled words, one per line, to standard output will do.

  set_pod_file_filter($code)
    If your project has POD documents written in languages other than
    English, then obviously you don't want to be running a spellchecker on
    every Perl file. "set_pod_file_filter" lets you filter out files
    returned from "all_pod_files" (and hence, the documents tested by
    "all_pod_files_spelling_ok").

        set_pod_file_filter(sub {
            my $filename = shift;
            return 0 if $filename =~ /_ja.pod$/; # skip Japanese translations
            return 1;
        });
