DESCRIPTION
    This is a release-stage plugin for Dist::Zilla that will ship your
    distribution releases to a local or remote Pinto repository.

    Before building the release, all repositories are checked for
    connectivity. If a repository is not responding you will be prompted to
    skip it or abort the entire release. If none of the repositories are
    responding, then the release will be aborted. Any errors encountered
    while shipping to the remaining repositories will also cause the rest of
    the release to abort.

    IMPORTANT: You need to install Pinto to make this plugin work. It ships
    separately so you can decide how you want to install it. Peronally, I
    recommend installing Pinto as a stand-alone application as described in
    Pinto::Manual::Installing and then setting the "PINTO_HOME" environment
    variable accordingly. But you can also just install Pinto from CPAN
    using the usual tools.

CONFIGURATION
    The following configuration parameters can be set in the "[Pinto::Add]"
    section of the dist.ini file for your distribution. Defaults for most
    paramters can be set via environment variables or via the repository
    configuration.

    root = REPOSITORY
        Specifies the root of the Pinto repository you want to ship to. It
        can be either a path to a local repository or a URI where pintod is
        listening. If not specified, it defaults to the
        "PINTO_REPOSITORY_ROOT" environment variable. You can ship to
        multiple repositories by specifying the "root" parameter multiple
        times. See also "USING MULTIPLE REPOSITORIES".

    authenticate = 0|1
        Indicates that authentication is required for communicating with the
        repository. If true, you will be prompted for a "password" unless it
        is provided as described below. Default is false.

    author = NAME
        Specifies your identity as a module author. It must be two or more
        alphanumeric characters and it will be forced to UPPERCASE. If not
        specified, it defaults to either the "PINTO_AUTHOR_ID" environment
        variable, or else your PAUSE ID (if you have one configured in
        ~/.pause), or else the "username" parameter.

    password = PASSWORD
        Specifies the password to use for authentication. If not specified,
        it defaults to the "PINTO_PASSWORD" environment variable, or else
        you will be prompted to enter a password. If your repository does
        require authentication, then you must also set the "authenticate"
        parameter to 1. For security reasons, I do not recommend putting
        your password in the dist.ini file.

    recurse = 0|1
        If true, Pinto will recursively pull all the distributions required
        to satisfy the prerequisites for the distribution you are adding. If
        false, Pinto will add the distribution only. If not specified, the
        default behavior is determined by the repository configuration.

    stack = NAME
        Specifies which stack in the repository to put the released
        distribution into. If not specified, it defaults to the stack that
        is currently marked as the default within the repository.

    username = NAME
        Specifies the username for server authentication. If not specified,
        it defaults to the "PINTO_USERNAME" environment variable, or else
        your current shell login.

    pinto_exe = PATH
        Specifies the full path to your "pinto" executable. If not
        specified, your "PATH" will be searched.

USING MULTIPLE REPOSITORIES
    You can ship your distribution to multiple repositories by specifying
    multiple the "root" paramter multiple times in your dist.ini file. In
    that case, the remaining parameters (e.g. "stack", "author",
    "authenticate") will apply to all the repositories.

    However, the recommended way to release to multiple repositories is to
    have multiple "[Pinto::Add / NAME]" blocks in your dist.ini file. This
    allows you to set attributes for each repository independently (at the
    expense of possibly having to duplicating some information).
