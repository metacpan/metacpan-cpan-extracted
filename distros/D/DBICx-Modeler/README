NAME
    DBICx::Modeler - A Moose-based model layer over DBIx::Class

VERSION
    Version 0.005

SYNOPSIS
        # Given the following schema:

        My::Schema::Artist
        My::Schema::Cd
        My::Schema::Track

        # ... and the following model:

        My::Model::Artist

        use DBICx::Modeler::Model

        My::Model::Cd ...
        My::Model::Track ...

        ...

        my $modeler = DBICx::Modeler->new( schema => ..., namespace => My::Model );

        my $artist = $modeler->create( Artist => { ... } ) # $artist is My::Model::Artist

        my $cd = $artist->create_related( cds => { ... } ) # $cd is My::Model::Cd

        ...

        my $search = $artist->cds( { title => ... } ) # Start a search ...
        $search->search( { ... } ) # Refine the search ...
        my @cds = $search->slice( 0, 9 ) # Get the first 10     
                                         # Each is of type My::Model::Cd

DESCRIPTION
    DBICx::Modeler is tool for making a thin, Moose-based model layer over a
    DBIx::Class schema

CAVEAT EMPTOR
  Many-to-many is not handled
    Many-to-many relationships are ignored, for now. You'll have to access
    "_model__storage" (which is the DBIx::Class::Row) if you want to play
    with them

  The same storage object can be present in different model objects
        # With the following example:
        $artist->cds( ... )->slice( 0 )->artist # $artist and ->artist are different objects

    This shouldn't be too difficult to fix.

  The modeler will probably barf when trying to modify  immutable Model:: classes
    This shouldn't be too difficult to fix, either.

  Use "DBIC_MODELER" to trace modeler setup
    Set "DBIC_MODELER" to 1 if you want to trace what is going on in the
    modeler internally

        $ENV{DBIC_MODELER} = 1

METHODS
    DBICx::Modeler->new( ... )

        schema          The connected DBIx::Class schema to use/inspect

        namespace       The package containing the Moose classes that will mimic the class structure of <schema>

    $modeler->model( <moniker> )

        Return the model source for <moniker>

    $modeler->create( <moniker> => ... )

        Create a new row for <moniker> and return the modeled object

    $modeler->search( <moniker> => ... )

        Make a search of <moniker> that will inflate into modeled objects
