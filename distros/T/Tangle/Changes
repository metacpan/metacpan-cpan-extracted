        - cleaned up code and spacing. Improved variable naming.
        - improved and expanded tests including CayleyDickson module tests
        - added pod documentation to Tangle.
        - improvements on the CNOT gate. Uses a quaternion for initial rotation.
        - added dimension testing: is_complex, is_quaternion, etc to CayleyDickson.pm
        - removed the triple references from the Cayley Dickson module, where they are not used.
        - Triple references moved into Tangle.pm, where they are used.
        - Changed gamma variable to I_SQUARED to more easily reveal its meaning as i^2 which is usually -1.
        - the outputs from the cnot are tied back to the inputs shared memory in a different manner.
0.03  TBD

        - compactified the gates for easy diffrentiation by eye.
        - completed CayleyDickson pod documentation.
