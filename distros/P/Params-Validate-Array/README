Params-Validate-Array version 0.0.3

Params::Validate::Array supplies a version of validate() 
from module Params::Validate which returns the arguments as an list,
and not the hash which Params::Validate::validate() returns.

The validate() routine is mostly a wrapper around the original
Params::Validate::validate() routine, which does all the hard work.
