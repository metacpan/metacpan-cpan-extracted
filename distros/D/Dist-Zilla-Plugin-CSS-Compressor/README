NAME

    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::CSS::Compressor - Compress CSS files

VERSION

    version 0.02

SYNOPSIS

     [CSS::Compressor]

DESCRIPTION

    Compress CSS files in your distribution using CSS::Compressor. By
    default for each foo.css file in your distribution this plugin will
    create a foo.min.css which has been compressed.

ATTRIBUTES

 finder

    Specifies a FileFinder for the CSS files that you want compressed. If
    this is not specified, it will compress all the CSS files that do not
    have a .min. in their filenames. Roughly equivalent to this:

     [FileFinder::ByName / CSSFiles]
     file = *.css
     skip = .min.
     [CSS::Compressor]
     finder = CSSFile

 output_regex

    Regular expression substitution used to generate the output filenames.
    By default this is

     [CSS::Compressor]
     output_regex = /\.css$/.min.css/

    which generates a foo.min.css for each foo.css.

 output

    Output filename. Not used by default, but if specified, all CSS files
    are merged and compressed into a single file using this as the output
    filename.

METHODS

 $plugin->gather_files( $arg )

    This method adds the compressed CSS files to your distribution.
