Revision history for overload::open

1.9.0 Jan 17, 2020
    - Make sure not to use // comments in the .xs file
    - Remove the minimum version requirement

1.8.0 Jan 16, 2020
    - Actually add G_EVAL|G_KEEPERR. Add tests which test what happens if our hook
      dies inside of it.

1.7.0 Jan 16, 2020
    - Revert base code to 1.4.0 since this had the cleanest cpan testers yet,
      but keep the G_EVAL|G_KEEPERR flags to call_sv()
    - Remove my warn() code which covered up a fatal panic condition and let Perl die if
      this occurs.

1.6.0 Jan 15, 2020
    - Use G_EVAL|G_KEEPERR flags to call_sv()
      These will ensure the hook does not change `$@' which can break
      error handling in programs.

1.5.0 Jan 14, 2020
    - Use another alternative for saving the mark, allowing us to do a popmark before returning

1.4.0 Jan 13, 2020
    - Fix possible issue in pointing math

1.03.0 Jan 13, 2020
    - Add some extra paranoia for ensuring we don't run our hook inside another
      hook. (check CvDEPTH for sysopen in open's hook and check CvDEPTH for
      open in sysopen's hook).

1.02.0 Jan 13, 2020
    - Add an option to suppress warnings. For now this is only
      applying to an internal error (so as long as you setup overload::open
      properly you should probably not get a warning

1.01.0 Jan 13, 2020
    - Use ssize_t instead of I32 when doing pointer math
    - If number of items is negative, don't attempt to PUSHMARK, just
      warn and don't try to do the prehook

1.00.2 Jan 11, 2020
    - Add provides to META and some code cleanup

1.00.1 Jan 11, 2020
    - Fix a lot of issues with META files and MANIFEST
    - Don't put files in build directory when running tests

1.00.0 Jan 10, 2020
    - Fix a bug with MARK
    - The bug would cause the filehandle to not be defined but was
      often hard to trigger.

0.33.0 Jan 8, 2020
    - This time we increase refcount at the start and decrease at the end, but
      also increase them in the ones we push onto the stack.

    - PS. the 0.32 module version is buggier than the 0.31

0.32.0 Jan 8, 2020
    - Decrement refcount before returning from hook

0.31.1 Dec 18, 2019
    - Make SYNOPSIS code actually work
    - Wrap POD to ~80 characters

0.31.0 Dec 18, 2019
    - Fix XS related bugs. Make sure we only get the
    correct number of items from the open call, and not
    everything on the stack
    - Minor changes to the POD

0.30.0 Dec 13, 2019
    - Fix version format so it's actually larger than previous release

0.02.1 Dec 13, 2019
    - Fix SYNOPSIS not being updated to API 0.2

0.02 Dec 11, 2019
    - Changed API
