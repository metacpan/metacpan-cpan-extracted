  replaced use of '$^X' with Probe::Perl to find interpreter to use in system call in t/001_load.t  it was suggested to use $^X in place of 'perl' for the purpose.  while that solution worked on my ubuntu boxes, it started failing in cpantesters (can't find Module::Install ...).  Probe::Perl was also suggested. Local testing is fine, so moving to cpantesters
