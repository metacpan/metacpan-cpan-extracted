Class::Tangram version 1.57
===========================

Class::Tangram serves to provide a base class for objects well suited
for storage into a Tangram SQL storage.

In some ways, it is similar to Class::Contract or Class::MethodMaker -
in that you define attributes for your class, and the module uses
those definitions to create what are known as ``accessor'' methods -
simply speaking, if you define class `Cheese' to have a `holes'
attribute, then you will get two functions - `Cheese->get_holes()' and
`Cheese->set_holes($x)'.  Also, there is a `Cheese->holes()' function
that behaves like a get or a set, depending on how it is called.  DWIM
is the motto.

However, it allows finer-grained specification of the types of
attributes than those other classes.  Currently the granularity is
geared towards the assumption that you're using the SQL Tangram
storage back-end - Tangram 2.

It should be stressed that storing Class::Tangram objects in a Tangram
storage, or ensuring that your classes in a Tangram storage are all
derived from Class::Tangram is not required.

This seperation is what makes Tangram what is known as ``orthogonal'',
and why you can run Tangram 2 side by side with other mapping tools.

If you want to know what the hell I'm rabbitting on about, first go to
the Tangram web site at http://www.tangram-persistence.org/, and read
the "Guided Tour" of Tangram.  It doesn't take long, and will vastly
assist `Aha!' moments whilst reading the Class::Tangram manual page.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   su root -c "make install"

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires Set::Object 1.04 or higher.  You may also want to
install Tangram 2.03 or later.  Realistically, you'll want the latest
version of Tangram - 2.07 or later is recommended.

Test::Simple 0.18 and Date::Manip 0.32 are also required to run the
test suite.

UPGRADING FROM 1.13

The large change in the version number represents a substantial
enhancement to the way `collection' attributes (ref, set, array, hash)
are treated.  See `perldoc lib/Class/Tangram/Containers.pod` for more
information.  If you only ever use the get_* methods for these types
of attributes in scalar context, this will not affect you.

Another important change is that `intermediate' classes are now
inserted into the inheritance tree.  Writers of ambitious code should
be careful not to call Class::Tangram::import_schema() until your
inheritance tree has `settled down'.

The contributed module Class::Tangram::Generator is now included.
It's worth a look!

In other news, support for Perl 5.005 has finally been neglected.

UPGRADING FROM 1.11

The biggest change is that previously, if you wanted to override what
happens when you get or set an attribute, you should have defined
set() and get() functions in your derived class.  Now, you are going
to have to define methods called get_attribute() and/or
set_attribute().  attribute() is a virtual method that calls
get_attribute() or set_attribute() - depending on the number of
arguments given - so don't override that unless you understand the
consequences.

The semantics for specifying an object's fields has changed slightly;
instead of defining $YourClass::schema, you should define
$YourClass::fields, which should contain what
$YourClass::schema->{fields} used to contain.  The module still looks
in the old location, so don't fret about changing your modules too
much :-).

UPGRADING FROM 1.09

There is only a very minor source incompatible change, that would
affect people who used tied values for their init_default attribute
options.  ie, it should not affect anyone.  e-mail me if the new
behaviour is not what you want!

UPGRADING FROM 1.07

There are no backwards-incompatibile changes in this release, unless
you have another Tangram::Type that provides the tangram type
"transient".

UPGRADING FROM 1.06

Most users should be able to install the new version without problems.

However, there are a few small places where slight changes could
affect your code.

   1. If you have an attribute that is an array or a flat array, and
      you evaluate it in list context, it now returns the contents of
      the array rather than a reference to the array.  This is keeping
      in line with the way Set::Object attributes work.

   2. If you were using the bogus "time" or "timestamp" types, you
      will need to switch to "rawtime", "rawdatetime" or "dmdatetime".
