NAME
    Bio::SeqAlignment::Components::SeqMapping Components relevant to
    sequence mapping

VERSION
    version 0.02

SYNOPSIS
      use Bio::SeqAlignment::Components::SeqMapping;
      use Bio::SeqAlignment::Components::SeqMapping::Mapper;
      use Bio::SeqAlignment::Components::SeqMapping::Dataflow;
      use Bio::SeqAlignment::Components::SeqMapping::Mapper::ComponentName;
      use Bio::SeqAlignment::Components::SeqMapping::Dataflow::ComponentName;

DESCRIPTION
    This module loads all the components relevant to sequence mapping. If
    you don't want to nuke your namespace with all the components, you can
    load them as needed by using the specific component name, e.g.:

      use Bio::SeqAlignment::Components::SeqMapping::Mapper::ComponentName;
      use Bio::SeqAlignment::Components::SeqMapping::Dataflow::ComponentName;

    where ComponentName is the name of the component you need. If you choose
    violence, you can load all the components at once by using:

      use Bio::SeqAlignment::Components::SeqMapping;

    or components from one of the two categories of modules, i.e. Mapper or
    Dataflow:

      use Bio::SeqAlignment::Components::SeqMapping::Mapper;
      use Bio::SeqAlignment::Components::SeqMapping::Dataflow;

COMPONENTS
    Mapper
        This module provides mapping modules for sequences. These modules
        available for loading are detailed in the documentation of the
        module itself.

    Dataflow
        This module provides dataflow modules for sequences. These modules
        available for loading are detailed in the documentation of the
        module itself.
