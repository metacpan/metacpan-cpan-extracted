     hasnt_uri($uri_string, $model, "Hasn't correct URI");
     has_subject($uri_string, $model, 'Subject URI is found');
     has_predicate($uri_string, $model, 'Predicate URI is found');
     has_object_uri($uri_string, $model, 'Object URI is found');

DESCRIPTION
    This Perl module, Test::RDF, provides tools for testing code which deals
    with RDF. It can test RDF for validity, check if two RDF graphs are the
    same, or subgraphs of each other, if a URI is or is not in a dataset, if
    it has certain subjects, predicates, objects or literals. It can also test
    to see if a full pattern is present or absent.

EXPORT
  is_valid_rdf
    Use to check if the input RDF string is valid in the chosen syntax

  is_rdf
    Use to check if the input RDF strings are isomorphic (i.e. the same).

  isomorph_graphs
    Use to check if the input RDF::Trine::Models have isomorphic graphs.

  are_subgraphs
    Use to check if the first RDF::Trine::Models is a subgraph of the second.

  has_subject
    Check if the string URI passed as first argument is a subject in any of
    the statements given in the model given as second argument.

  has_predicate
    Check if the string URI passed as first argument is a predicate in any of
    the statements given in the model given as second argument.

  has_object_uri
    Check if the string URI passed as first argument is a object in any of the
    statements given in the model given as second argument.

  has_literal
    Check if the string passed as first argument, with corresponding optional
    language and datatype as second and third respectively, is a literal in
    any of the statements given in the model given as fourth argument.

    language and datatype may not occur in the same statement, so the test
    fails if they are both set. If none are used, use `undef`, like e.g.

     has_literal('A test', undef, undef, $model, 'Simple literal');

    A test for a typed literal may be done like

     has_literal('42', undef, 'http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer', $model, 'Just an integer');

    and a language literal like

     has_literal('This is a Another test', 'en', undef, $model, 'Language literal');

  hasnt_literal
    This is like the above, only the opposite: It checks if a literal doesn't
    exist. Like the above, the test will fail if the literal is invalid,
    however.

  has_uri
    Check if the string URI passed as first argument is present in any of the
    statements given in the model given as second argument.

  hasnt_uri
    Check if the string URI passed as first argument is not present in any of
    the statements given in the model given as second argument.

  pattern_target
    Tests that the object passed as its parameter is an RDF::Trine::Model or
    RDF::Trine::Store. That is, tests that it is a valid thing to match basic
    graph patterns against.

    Additionally, this test establishes the target for future `pattern_ok`
    tests.

  pattern_ok
    Tests that the pattern passed matches against the target established by
    `pattern_target`. The pattern may be passed as an RDF::Trine::Pattern, or
    a list of RDF::Trine::Statement objects.

     use Test::RDF;
     use RDF::Trine qw[iri literal blank variable statement];
     use My::Module;

     my $foaf = RDF::Trine::Namespace->new('http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/');
     pattern_target(My::Module->get_model); # check isa RDF::Trine::Model
     pattern_ok(
       statement(
         variable('who'),
         $foaf->name,
         literal('Kjetil Kjernsmo')
         ),
       statement(
         variable('who'),
         $foaf->page,
         iri('http://search.cpan.org/~kjetilk/')
         ),
       "Data contains Kjetil's details."
       );

    Note: `pattern_target` must have been tested before any `pattern_ok`
    tests.

  pattern_fail
    The same as above, but tests if the pattern returns no results instead.

NOTE
    Graph isomorphism is a complex problem, so do not attempt to run the
    isomorphism tests on large datasets. For more information see
    <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_isomorphism_problem>.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
    Michael Hendricks wrote the first Test::RDF. The present module is a
    complete rewrite from scratch using Gregory Todd William's
    RDF::Trine::Graph to do the heavy lifting.
