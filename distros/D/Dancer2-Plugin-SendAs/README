NAME

    Dancer2::Plugin::SendAs - (DEPRECATED) Dancer2 plugin to send data as
    specific content type

VERSION

    version 0.002

SYNOPSIS

        use Dancer2;
        use Dancer2::Plugin::SendAs;
    
        set serializer => 'YAML';
        set template => 'template_toolkit';
    
        get '/html' => sub {
            send_as html => template 'foo';
        };
    
        get '/json/**' => sub {
            send_as json => splat;
        };

DESCRIPTION

    This plugin is DEPRECATED. The send_as functionality was merged into
    Dancer2 v0.200000.

    A plugin to make it easy to return a specific content type from routes.

    When an app has a serializer defined, returning HTML content is messy.
    You could use send_file, but need to take care of encoding yourself,
    adding unnecessary boilerplate. Another solution is to split your app;
    resulting in routes that return serialized content separated from
    routes that return HTML. If there are a small number of routes (think
    O(1)) that return HTML, splitting the app is tedious.

    Conversly, returning serialized content from a small number of routes
    from an app that otherwise returns HTML has similar issues.

    This plugin provides a send_as keyword, allowing content to be returned
    from any available Dancer2 serializer, or HTML.

METHODS

 send_as type => content

    Send the content "serialized" using the specified serializer, or as
    HTML if no matching serializer is found.

    Any available Dancer2 serializer may be used. Serializers are loaded at
    runtime (if necessary). Both the uppercase 'type' and the provided case
    of the type are used to find an appropriate serializer class to use.

    The implementation of send_as uses Dancer2's send_file. Your route will
    be exited immediately when send_as is executed. send_file will stream
    content back to the client if your server supports psgi streaming.
