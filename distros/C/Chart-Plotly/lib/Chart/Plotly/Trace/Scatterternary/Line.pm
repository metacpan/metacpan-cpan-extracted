=head1 NAME

Chart::Plotly::Trace::Scatterternary::Line - This attribute is one of the possible options for the trace scatterternary.

=head1 VERSION

version 0.027

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use HTML::Show;
 use Chart::Plotly;
 use Chart::Plotly::Trace::Scatterternary;
 my $scatterternary = Chart::Plotly::Trace::Scatterternary->new( x => [ 1 .. 5 ], y => [ 1 .. 5 ] );
 
 HTML::Show::show( Chart::Plotly::render_full_html( data => [$scatterternary] ) );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This attribute is part of the possible options for the trace scatterternary.

This file has been autogenerated from the official plotly.js source.

=head1 DISCLAIMER

This is an unofficial Plotly Perl module. Currently I'm not affiliated in any way with Plotly. 
But I think plotly.js is a great library and I want to use it with perl.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 TO_JSON

Serialize the trace to JSON. This method should be called only by L<JSON> serializer.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=over

=item * color

Sets the line color.

=item * dash

Sets the dash style of lines. Set to a dash type string (*solid*, *dot*, *dash*, *longdash*, *dashdot*, or *longdashdot*) or a dash length list in px (eg *5px,10px,2px,2px*).

=item * shape

Determines the line shape. With *spline* the lines are drawn using spline interpolation. The other available values correspond to step-wise line shapes.

=item * smoothing

Has an effect only if `shape` is set to *spline* Sets the amount of smoothing. *0* corresponds to no smoothing (equivalent to a *linear* shape).

=item * width

Sets the line width (in px).
