METHODS

    This package implements the following methods:

 call

      call(Str | CodeRef $arg) : Object

    The call method takes a method name or coderef, registers it as the
    tryable routine, and returns the object. When invoked, the callback
    will received an invocant if one was provided to the constructor, the
    default arguments if any were provided to the constructor, and whatever
    arguments were provided by the invocant.

    call example #1

        use routines;
      
        my $try = Data::Object::Try->new;
      
        $try->call(fun (@args) {
      
          return [@args];
        });

 callback

      callback(Str | CodeRef $arg) : CodeRef

    The callback method takes a method name or coderef, and returns a
    coderef for registration. If a coderef is provided this method is
    mostly a passthrough.

    callback example #1

        use routines;
      
        my $try = Data::Object::Try->new;
      
        $try->callback(fun (@args) {
      
          return [@args];
        });

    callback example #2

        package Example;
      
        use Moo;
        use routines;
      
        fun test(@args) {
      
          return [@args];
        }
      
        package main;
      
        my $try = Data::Object::Try->new(
          invocant => Example->new
        );
      
        $try->callback('test');

 catch

      catch(Str $isa, Str | CodeRef $arg) : Any

    The catch method takes a package or ref name, and when triggered checks
    whether the captured exception is of the type specified and if so
    executes the given callback.

    catch example #1

        use routines;
      
        my $try = Data::Object::Try->new;
      
        $try->call(fun (@args) {
      
          die $try;
        });
      
        $try->catch('Data::Object::Try', fun (@args) {
      
          return [@args];
        });

 default

      default(Str | CodeRef $arg) : Object

    The default method takes a method name or coderef and is triggered if
    no catch conditions match the exception thrown.

    default example #1

        use routines;
      
        my $try = Data::Object::Try->new;
      
        $try->call(fun (@args) {
      
          die $try;
        });
      
        $try->default(fun (@args) {
      
          return [@args];
        });

 execute

      execute(CodeRef $arg, Any @args) : Any

    The execute method takes a coderef and executes it with any given
    arguments. When invoked, the callback will received an invocant if one
    was provided to the constructor, the default arguments if any were
    provided to the constructor, and whatever arguments were passed
    directly to this method.

    execute example #1

        use routines;
      
        my $try = Data::Object::Try->new(
          invocant => Example->new,
          arguments => [1,2,3]
        );
      
        $try->execute(fun (@args) {
      
          return [@args];
        });

 finally

      finally(Str | CodeRef $arg) : Object

    The finally method takes a package or ref name and always executes the
    callback after a try/catch operation. The return value is ignored. When
    invoked, the callback will received an invocant if one was provided to
    the constructor, the default arguments if any were provided to the
    constructor, and whatever arguments were provided by the invocant.

    finally example #1

        use routines;
      
        my $try = Data::Object::Try->new(
          invocant => Example->new,
          arguments => [1,2,3]
        );
      
        $try->call(fun (@args) {
      
          return $try;
        });
      
        $try->finally(fun (@args) {
      
          $try->{'$finally'} = [@args];
        });

 maybe

      maybe() : Object

    The maybe method registers a default catch condition that returns
    falsy, i.e. an empty string, if an exception is encountered.

    maybe example #1

        use routines;
      
        my $try = Data::Object::Try->new;
      
        $try->call(fun (@args) {
      
          die $try;
        });
      
        $try->maybe;

 no_catch

      no_catch() : Object

    The no_catch method removes any configured catch conditions and returns
    the object.

    no_catch example #1

        use routines;
      
        my $try = Data::Object::Try->new;
      
        $try->call(fun (@args) {
      
          die $try;
        });
      
        $try->catch('Data::Object::Try', fun (@args) {
      
          return [@args];
        });
      
        $try->no_catch;

 no_default

      no_default() : Object

    The no_default method removes any configured default condition and
    returns the object.

    no_default example #1

        use routines;
      
        my $try = Data::Object::Try->new;
      
        $try->call(fun (@args) {
      
          die $try;
        });
      
        $try->default(fun (@args) {
      
          return [@args];
        });
      
        $try->no_default;

 no_finally

      no_finally() : Object

    The no_finally method removes any configured finally condition and
    returns the object.

    no_finally example #1

        use routines;
      
        my $try = Data::Object::Try->new(
          invocant => Example->new,
          arguments => [1,2,3]
        );
      
        $try->call(fun (@args) {
      
          return $try;
        });
      
        $try->finally(fun (@args) {
      
          $try->{'$finally'} = [@args];
        });
      
        $try->no_finally;

 no_try

      no_try() : Object

    The no_try method removes any configured try operation and returns the
    object.

    no_try example #1

        use routines;
      
        my $try = Data::Object::Try->new;
      
        $try->call(fun (@args) {
      
          return [@args];
        });
      
        $try->no_try;

 result

      result(Any @args) : Any

    The result method executes the try/catch/default/finally logic and
    returns either 1) the return value from the successfully tried
    operation 2) the return value from the successfully matched catch
    condition if an exception was thrown 3) the return value from the
    default catch condition if an exception was thrown and no catch
    condition matched. When invoked, the try and finally callbacks will
    received an invocant if one was provided to the constructor, the
    default arguments if any were provided to the constructor, and whatever
    arguments were passed directly to this method.

    result example #1

        use routines;
      
        my $try = Data::Object::Try->new;
      
        $try->call(fun (@args) {
      
          return [@args];
        });
      
        $try->result;

    result example #2

        use routines;
      
        my $try = Data::Object::Try->new;
      
        $try->call(fun (@args) {
      
          return [@args];
        });
      
        $try->result(1..5);
