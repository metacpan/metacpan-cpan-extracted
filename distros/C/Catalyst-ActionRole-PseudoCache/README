NAME
    Catalyst::ActionRole::PseudoCache - Super simple caching for Catalyst
    actions

VERSION
    version 1.000003

SYNOPSIS
     package MyApp::Controller::Root;

     use Moose;
     BEGIN { extends 'Catalyst::Controller::ActionRole' };

     # used with Catalyst::Plugin::Cache
     sub cache_js :Local Does(PseudoCache) PCTrueCache(1) {
       my ($self, $c) = @_;
       # Long running action to be cached
     }

     # used with Catalyst::Plugin::Cache and the optional key attr
     sub cache_with_key :Local Does(PseudoCache) PCTrueCache(1) PCKey('rememberme'){
       my ($self, $c) = @_;
       # Long running action to be cached
     }

DESCRIPTION
    This module was originally made to take the output of
    Catalyst::View::JavaScript::Minifier::XS and store it in a file so that
    after the server booted we would not need to generate it again and could
    let the static web server serve up the static file. Obviously it can be
    used for much more than javascript, but it's mostly made with large,
    purely javascript sites in mind. It does not cache the output of the
    action when the server is run in development mode.

ATTRIBUTES
  PCTrueCache
    Setting PCTrueCache will use Catalyst::Plugin::Cache and allow a real
    cache backend to do the work. After version 2 of this module this will
    no longer need to be set and the old mode of this plugin will be removed
    entirely.

  PCKey
    PCKey is an optional way of providing a different key for the cache
    backend. The default key is "Controller::Name/action".

    The two attributes below are DEPRECATED and provided for back compat
    only. They might disappear in the future. Using "PCTrueCache" and
    Catalyst::Plugin::Cache is highly recommended.

  PCUrl
    Required when not using "PCTrueCache".

    After the action runs once it will redirect to $PCUrl.

  PCPath
    When the action gets run the first time it will write it's output to
    $PCPath.

    Defaults to "$c->path_to('root') . $PCUrl"

    So using the example given above for the "all_js" action, the path will
    be

     $MyAppLocation/root/static/js/all.js

THANKS
    Thanks to Geoffrey Darling for writing all the code for the modern true
    cache mode
