NAME

Math::Interpolator - interpolate between lazily-evaluated points

DESCRIPTION

This class supports interpolation of a curve between known points,
known as "knots", with the knots being lazily evaluated.  An object of
this type represents a set of knots on a one-dimensional curve, the knots
possibly not being predetermined.  The methods implemented in this class
extract knots, forcing evaluation as required.  Subclasses implement
interpolation by various algorithms.

This code is neutral as to numeric type.  The coordinate values used
in interpolation may be native Perl numbers, "Math::BigRat" objects,
or possibly other types.  Mixing types within a single interpolation is
not recommended.
