0.0.11 (2018-08-18)

    Enhancements:
        - Set @CARP_NOT correctly to indicate where OptArgs2 callers
          are making errors.

    Bug Fixes:
        - Arguments that didn't match known sub-commands would fail to
          raise errors. Reported by Mario Domgoergen (mdom at Github).

    Dependencies:
        - Tests depend on Test2::V0 instead of old Bundle

    Packaging:
        - Ensure Getopt::Args::* utility packages are not indexed on
          CPAN.
        - Migrate back to ExtUtils::MakeMaker
        - Keep README up to date using githook-perltidy's .readme_from
          and track it in Git again so that Github shows something
          reasonable again.

0.0.10 (2018-06-26)

    Enhancements:
        - Output Sub-Commands *after* Options in usage message
        - Allow "Flag" options to have defaults as I don't remember
          what the reason may have been for the restriction. I also
          can't think of a valid one now, and it is sometimes useful to
          set a Flag value based on %ENV.
        - Convert command_names to command-names in messages

    Bug Fixes:
        - Remove Getopts/Args2.pm from MANIFEST.SKIP

0.0.9 (2016-12-03)

    Enhancements:
        - Sub commands are always called and no longer depend on a
          particular SubCmd arg type. The arg isa='SubCmd' type is now
          simply a usage pressentation instruction.

0.0.8 (2016-10-17)

    New Features:
        - New "usage()" function

    Dependencies:
        - Require at least Perl 5.10 for "//=" support.

0.0.6 (2016-07-03)

    Bug Fixes:
        - Fix command name handling broken by /r fixes in 0.0.2.
        - Correctly pass the option value to triggers
        - Use "--counter" in usage message for Counter options instead
          of "--counter="

0.0.4 (2016-05-21)

    Bug Fixes:
        - One more /r fixup
        - Build lib/Getopt/Args2.pm from Build.PL

0.0.2 (2016-05-18)

    Bug Fixes:
        - Remove the other uses of /r in regexes that I missed in
          the previous version.

0.0.1_2 (2016-05-10)

    Bug Fixes:
        - Don't use the /r modifier (non-destructive substitution) on
          regex replacements as it is not supported by Perl's earlier
          than 5.14.

0.0.1_1 (2016-05-09)

    Initial release.
