<h2>Introduction</h2>
<hr />
<p>UR is a Class Framework and Object/Relational Mapper (ORM) for Perl.</p>

<p>After installing, run the "ur" command for a list of options.</p>

<p>As a Class Framework, it starts with the familiar Perl meme of the blessed
hash reference as the basis for object instances, and builds upon that 
with a more formal way to describe classes and their properties, object
caching, and metadata about the classes and the ways they connect to each
other.</p>

<p>As an ORM, it aims to relieve the developer from having to think about the
SQL behind any particular request, instead using the class structure and
its metadata as a guide for where the data will be found.  Behind the scenes,
the RDBMS portion can handle JOINs (both INNER and OUTER) representing
inheritance and indirect properties, multi-column primary and foreign keys,
and iterators.  It does its best to only query the database for information
you've directly asked for, and to not query the database for something that
has been loaded before.  Oracle, SQLite, MySQL and PostgreSQL are all
supported.</p>

<p>Additionally, UR can use files or collections of files as if they were
tables in a database, as well as internally handling the equivalent of an
SQL join between two or more databases if that's what the query and class
structure indicates.</p>

<p>UR.pm contains more introductory POD documentation.  UR::Manual has a short
list of documentation you're likely to want to see next.</p>
