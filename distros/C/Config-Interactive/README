Config::Interactive

VERSION

DECRIPTION

Provides a convenient way for loading   config values from a given file and
returns it as a hash structure, allows interpolation for the   perl scalars ( $xxxx ${xxx} )
and inside of XML fragments as well.
Also, it can run interactive session with user, use predefined prompts, use validation patterns
and store back into the file, preserving the original order of the comments and definitions.
Motivation behind this module was inspired by Config::General module which was missing required
functionality ( preservation of the comments order and positioining, prompts and validation for 
command line based UI ). This module is extremely useful as CLI frontend to your application.
