# Note: Species Information taken from  (Schrade et al., Animals 2024, Table 2):
# COMPONENT I 
#   * Element 1 (positions 1-3): 3-letter taxonomic code
#       (Class | Order | Family, e.g. "MPC" for Mammalia | Primates | Cercopithecidae)
#   * Element 2 (positions 5-10): 6-letter binomial acronym
#       (first 3 letters of Genus + first 3 letters of species, e.g. "MacMul" for Macaca mulatta)
#   
# In this file:
#   - code      = Element 2 (binomial acronym)
#   - tax_code  = Element 1 (taxonomic classification)
#                 included here only as metadata, NOT used in current encode/decode routines
#   - stub_code = 2-character Base-62 species index (unique identifier)
