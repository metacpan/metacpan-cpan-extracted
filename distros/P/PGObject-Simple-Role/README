PGObject-Simple-Role

PGObject::Simple::Role is a Moo/Moose mapper for minimalist PGObject framework 
(embodied in PGObject::Simple).  Basically it provides a way to easily map 
stored procedures using the conventions of PGObject::Simple for Moo/Moose 
environments.

PGObject::Simple::Role is a Moo role which allows you to use this functionality
in Moo and Moose environments.  The role itself makes no assumptions about 
database state, but provides hooks for classes to use to retrieve or create
database handles for their use.

This module is suited to quick and easy integration of PostgreSQL stored
procedures with Moo and Moose object models.  It is quite powerful and it makes
developing in such environments relatively easy.
