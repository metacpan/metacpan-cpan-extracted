	#!/usr/bin/perl -w

	use strict;
	use XBase;

	my $table = new XBase "ndx-num.dbf";
	my $cur = $table->prepare_select_with_index("ndx-num.ndx");
	$cur->find_eq(1097);

	while (my @data = $cur->fetch())
		{ print "@data\n"; }
	__END__

Since the 0.063 version of the XBase module, there is a new support
for ndx index files, since 0.0693 we have support for ntx, since 0.13*
we more or less supprot mdx, idx and cdx.

The first example shows how to find all rows equal or greater than
1097. The order is taken from the index file ndx-num.ndx. Note that at
the moment there is not check made that the index really belongs to
the dbf (and the check is impossible, so there will be none in the
future). If you have different index format, just specify different
file name -- the index format is derived from the file extension.

The values in the index (AFAIK) can be character strings, numeric and
dates.  There is probably no problem when using strings and numeric,
but when you want to do find_eq for date, you have to convert it to
Julian format first:

	#!/usr/bin/perl -w

	use strict;
	use XBase;
	use Time::JulianDay;

	my $table = new XBase "ndx-date.dbf" or die XBase->errstr;
	my $cur = $table->prepare_select_with_index("ndx-date.ndx")
						or die $table->errstr;
						
	$cur->find_eq(julian_day(1997, 12, 12));
	while (my @data = $cur->fetch)
		{ print "@data\n"; }
	__END__

If you want to test if the XBase::Index part works fine on your data,
you can call it directly:

	#!/usr/bin/perl -w 

	use strict;
	use XBase::Index;

	my $index = new XBase::Index "klantnum.ndx";
	$index->prepare_select;

	while (my @data = $index->fetch())
		{ print "@data\n"; }
	__END__

Note that we explicitely create object XBase::Index, not XBase, and
call methods of this object, not of cursor object.

This will list the keys from the ndx file, together with their
corresponding values, which are the record numbers in the dbf file.
If the results are not those you would expect, email me.

If you have an index format that can hold more index structures in one
file (mdx, cdx), you have to specify the tag in the file:

	my $index = new XBase::Index "cust.cdx", 'tag' => 'addr';

With the XBase and prepare_select_with_index, you would specify an
arrayref instead of the index file name, holding file name and tag
name:

	my $cur = $table->prepare_select_with_index(
		[ "cust.cdx", 'addr' ], 'field1', 'field2');

There is a script indexdump that does the dump for you.

If you have an compound index, with an expression instead of just
plain field name, chances are that XBase.pm won't be able to recognize
the type of the index. You can specify the type of the index as the
third parameter in the first anonymous array, like

	my $cur = $table->prepare_select_with_index(
		[ "cust.cdx", 'addr+zip', 'char' ], 'field1', 'field2');
