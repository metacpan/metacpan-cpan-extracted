Statistics::Regression version 0.50
===================================

Statistics/Regression.pm is a multivariate linear regression package.  That is,
it estimates the c coefficients for a line-fit of the type

    y= c(0)*x(0) + c(1)*x1 + c(2)*x2 + ... + c(k)*xk

given a data set of N observations, each with k independent x variables and one
y variable.  Naturally, N must be greater than k---and preferably considerably
greater.  Any reasonable undergraduate statistics book will explain what a
regression is.  Most of the time, the user will provide a constant ('1') as
x(0) for each observation in order to allow the regression package to fit an
intercept.

BACKGROUND WARNING

You should have an understanding of OLS regressions if you want to use this
package.  You can get this from an introductory college econometrics class
and/or from most intermediate college statistics classes.  If you do not have
this background knowledge, then this package will remain a mystery to you.
There is no support for this package--please don't expect any.
