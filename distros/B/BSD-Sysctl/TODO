TODO list for BSD::Sysctl

4. Offer a tie interface?
   tie my $loadavg, 'BSD::Sysctl', 'vm.loadavg', {offset=>0};
   while(1) {
       print "$loadavg\n";
       sleep 1;
   }

5. Offer functions that fetch popular values directly (e.g.
pagefree(), representing vm.vmtotal's "number of vm pages free"
value.

7. Deal with bsd-sysctl.pl in a cleverer way (insert the
contents into Sysctl.pm when copying to blib/lib.

8. Add Makefile rules to deal with changes to mibfmt.map

9. eg/mib_scan.pl reports that a number of more obscure
variables are not fetched correctly. The failures need
to be diagnosed.

10. Obtain access to NetBSD and OpenBSD platforms.

11. Remember to tweak the kern.ipc.maxsockbuf test when
support for other platforms is added.
