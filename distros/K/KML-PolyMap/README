README for Geo::KML::PolyMap v 1.34

1. Description
-------
Geo::KML::PolyMap generates KML or KMZ-formatted maps for Google Earth. Given a
set of polygonal regions and a number associated with each region (for example,
city blocks and population counts on each block), Geo::KML::PolyMap generates a
choropleth map showing the data value for each region as a shaded polygon. The
polygons are divided into a number of bins, with the color of each bin unique.
Optionally, Geo::KML::PolyMap will generate a legend along with the map file to
illustrate the data ranges represented by each color.

A good demo application (and the one for which this was designed) is located
at http://gecensus.stanford.edu. This site uses the Geo::KML::PolyMap module to
display maps of US Census data in Google Earth.

If you develop an application that uses this, I'd love to hear about it.
