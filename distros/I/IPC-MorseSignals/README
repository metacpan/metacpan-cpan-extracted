NAME
    IPC::MorseSignals - Communicate between processes with Morse signals.

VERSION
    Version 0.17

WARNING
    Due to the POSIX signals specification (which I wasn't aware of at the
    time I wrote this module), this module is by nature completely
    unreliable and will never work properly. It is therefore deprecated.
    Please don't use it (if you were actually crazy enough to use it).

SYNOPSIS
        # In the sender process
        use IPC::MorseSignals::Emitter;

        my $deuce = IPC::MorseSignals::Emitter->new(speed => 1024);
        $deuce->post('HLAGH') for 1 .. 3;
        $deuce->send($pid);

        ...

        # In the receiver process
        use IPC::MorseSignals::Receiver;

        local %SIG;
        my $pants = IPC::MorseSignals::Receiver->new(\%SIG, done => sub {
         print STDERR "GOT $_[1]\n";
        });

DESCRIPTION
    This module implements a rare form of IPC by sending Morse-like signals
    through "SIGUSR1" and "SIGUSR2". Both of those signals are used, so you
    won't be able to keep them for something else when you use this module.

    *   IPC::MorseSignals::Emitter is a base class for emitters ;

    *   IPC::MorseSignals::Receiver is a base class for receivers.

    But, seriously, use something else for your IPC. :)

CAVEATS
    When the same signal is sent several times in a row to a process, the
    POSIX standard does not guarantee that the relevant signal handler will
    be called for each of the notifications. This will result in malformed
    messages if the transfer speed is so high that the operating system does
    not have the time to call the signal handler for each bit.

DEPENDENCIES
    You need the complete Bit::MorseSignals distribution.

    Carp (standard since perl 5), POSIX (idem) and Time::HiRes (since perl
    5.7.3) are also required.
