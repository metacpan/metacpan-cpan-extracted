NAME
    UNIVERSAL::AUTHORITY - adds an AUTHORITY method to UNIVERSAL

SYNOPSIS
     if (HTML::HTML5::Writer->AUTHORITY ne HTML::HTML5::Builder->AUTHORITY)
     {
       warn "Closely intertwined modules with different authors!\n";
       warn "There may be trouble ahead...";
     }

     # Only trust STEVAN's releases
     Moose->AUTHORITY('cpan:STEVAN'); # dies if doesn't match

DESCRIPTION
    This module is deprecated: use UNIVERSAL::AUTHORITY::Lexical instead.

    This module adds an `AUTHORITY` function to the `UNIVERSAL` package, which
    works along the same lines as the `VERSION` function. Because it is
    defined in `UNIVERSAL`, it becomes instantly available as a method for any
    blessed objects, and as a class method for any package.

    The authority of a package can be defined like this:

     package MyApp;
     BEGIN { $MyApp::AUTHORITY = 'cpan:JOEBLOGGS'; }

    The authority should be a URI identifying the person, team, organisation
    or trained chimp responsible for the release of the package. The
    pseudo-URI scheme `cpan:` is the most commonly used identifier.

  `UNIVERSAL::AUTHORITY`
    Called with no parameters returns the authority of a CPAN release.

  `UNIVERSAL::AUTHORITY($test)`
    If passed a test, will croak if the test fails. The authority is tested
    against the test using something approximating Perl 5.10's smart match
    operator. (Briefly, you can pass a string for `eq` comparison, a regular
    expression, a code reference to use as a callback, or an array reference
    that will be grepped.)
