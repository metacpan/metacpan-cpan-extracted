Revision history for Perl extension HTTP::GetImages.

Version 0.34*, updates by Lee Goddard:

	Re-implemented the `dont =' ['ALL']> feature that got lost
	during the redesign of the API; agent now makes multiple
	attempts to get the image.

Version 0.32, updates by Lee Goddard: fixed bugs..

Version 0.31, updates by Lee Goddard: added 'max_size'.

Version 0.3, updates by Lee Goddard:

	Made it a nicer API and tidied up some coding and added a couple of
	methods. Started to add tests.

Version 0.25, updates by Duncan Lamb and Lee Goddard:

	* The character "~" in the URL would confuse the "abs_url"
	subroutine, resolving "http://www.o.com/~home/page.html" to
	"http://www.o.com". It doesn't any more.
	* Double obliques in a link would cause an endless loop - no longer.
	* A link refrencing its own directory with "./" would also cause an
	endless loop - but no more.
	* "EXTENSIONS_BAD" list added.
	* "NEWNAMES" updated.
	* Frame parsing.
	* Multiple minimum-paths for URLs added.
