=head1 NAME

UI::Dialog::Backend::ASCII - Dialog backend for the native Perl mode of basic text.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use UI::Dialog::Backend::ASCII;
  my $d = new UI::Dialog::Backend::ASCII ( backtitle => 'Demo',
                                           title => 'Default' );

  $d->msgbox( title => 'Welcome!', text => 'Welcome one and all!' );

=head1 ABSTRACT

UI::Dialog::Backend::ASCII is the UI::Dialog backend for the native Perl mode
of basic text. The widgets are very much "rigid" in that the width and height
arguments are completely ignored.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This backend is intended as a last resort mechanism in that no other dialog
variant has been found and so this, the most absolute of bargain basement
dialog variant interfaces, is used instead.
