NAME

    Business::CyberSource - Perl interface to the CyberSource Simple Order
    SOAP API

VERSION

    version 0.010008

DESCRIPTION

    This library is a Perl interface to the CyberSource Simple Order SOAP
    API built on Moose and XML::Compile::SOAP technologies. This library
    aims to eventually provide a full interface the SOAPI.

    You may wish to read the Official CyberSource Documentation on Credit
    Card Services for the Simpler Order API
    <http://apps.cybersource.com/library/documentation/dev_guides/CC_Svcs_SO_API/html/>
    as it will provide further information on why what some things are and
    the general workflow.

    To get started you will want to read the documentation in
    Business::CyberSource::Client and Business::CyberSource::Request. If
    you find any documentation unclear or outright missing, please file a
    bug.

    If there are features that are part of CyberSource's API but are not
    documented, or are missing here, please file a bug. I'll be happy to
    add them, but due to the size of the upstream API, I have not had time
    to cover all the features and some are currently undocumented.

ENVIRONMENT

 Debugging

    Supports MooseY::RemoteHelper::Role::Clients REMOTE_CLIENT_DEBUG
    variable. This can be set to either 0, 1, 2, for varying levels of
    verbosity.

 Testing

    all environment variables are prefixed with PERL_BUSINESS_CYBERSOURCE_

  Credentials

   USERNAME

   PASSWORD

    set's the username and password in the client for running tests.

  Direct Currency Conversion

   DCC_CC_YYYY

    sets the test credit card expiration year for both Visa and MasterCard

   DCC_CC_MM

    sets the test credit card expiration month for both Visa and MasterCard

   DCC_MASTERCARD

    A test credit card number provided by your your credit card processor

   DCC_VISA

    A test credit card number provided by your your credit card processor

EXAMPLE

    In the example, carp means you should log something Dumper means you
    should log it with lots of detail. Safe::Isa is used because you should
    either use it or check for blessed it is always possible that somewhere
    in the stack someone is using die on a string.

                            # you probably want to record this
                            say $capture_response->capture->reconciliation_id;
                    }
            }

    This code is not meant to be DRY, but more of a top to bottom example.
    Also note that if you really want to do Authorization and Capture at
    one time use a Sale. Most common Reasons for Exceptions would be bad
    input into the request object (which validates things) or CyberSource
    just randomly throwing an ERROR, in which case you can usually just
    retry later. You don't have to print the response on error during
    development, you can easily just use the REMOTE_CLIENT_DEBUG
    Environment variable.
