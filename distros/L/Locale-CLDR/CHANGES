0.46.0 2025-01-17
    Updated to use version 45 of CLDR
    
    *WARNING* The minimum supported version now supported is v5.12.0 This is due to external Perl libries neading 5.12.0 as a minimum version
    
    *WARNING* There are several language packs that have as parents locales in other language packs. You wont notice
    this if you are installing from CPAN with one of the CPAN clients but if you are installing manually you will have
    to resolve these dependancies
    
    *WARNING* The locale data no longer uses Any as a place holder for missing script data. Where this was used in earlier
    versions the default script as defined by the CLDR data is used. This may have an inpact on the nameing of locales and
    if you use the locale data without using Locale::CLDR
    
    *WARNING* The Unicode cosortium has changed some of the identifieres used by units. If you are no longer getting
    values back for unit data check the id.

    Added Chinease segmentation test to test the above
