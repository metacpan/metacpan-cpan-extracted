NAME
    PITA::Test::Image::Qemu - A tiny Qemu test image that only boots and
    pings

DESCRIPTION
    This distribution contains a small Qemu image intended for snapshot-mode
    testing of the PITA::Guest::Driver::Qemu module.

    Primarily, it is intended for testing the launch-shutdown cycle, and not
    for testing discovery or package testing.

    It verifies that the driver is using the qemu binary properly.

METHODS
  filename
    The static "filename" method returns the location of the expanded
    testing image, verified to exist. The file will be available only with
    read permissions, and without the ability to write.

SUPPORT
    Bugs should be reported via the CPAN bug tracker at

    <http://rt.cpan.org/NoAuth/ReportBug.html?Queue=PITA-Test-Image-Qemu>

    For other issues, contact the author.
