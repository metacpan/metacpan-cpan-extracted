=head1 DESCRIPTION

Plantuml is a library for generating UML diagrams from a simple text markup language.

This is a simple Perl remote client interface to a plantuml server using the same custom encoding used by most other plantuml clients. Perl was missing from the list.

There are other plantuml Perl libraries, like PlantUML::ClassDiagram::Parse, they provide only parsing capabilities for Class Diagrams. In contrast WWW::PlantUML module provides accessing any UML Diagram Type in various formats supported by any plantUML server via HTTP Protocol.
