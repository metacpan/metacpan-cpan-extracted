NAME
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::DAGOLDEN - Dist::Zilla configuration the way
    DAGOLDEN does it

VERSION
    version 0.078

SYNOPSIS
      # in dist.ini
      [@DAGOLDEN]

DESCRIPTION
    This is a Dist::Zilla PluginBundle. It is roughly equivalent to the
    following dist.ini:

      ; version provider
      [RewriteVersion] ; also munges

      ; collect contributors list
      [Git::Contributors]

      ; choose files to include
      [Git::GatherDir]         ; everything from git ls-files

      exclude_filename = README.mkdn  ; skip this generated file
      exclude_filename = META.json    ; skip this generated file
      exclude_filename = cpanfile     ; skip this generated file
      exclude_filename = Makefile.PL  ; skip this generated file

      [PruneCruft]        ; default stuff to skip
      [ManifestSkip]      ; if -f MANIFEST.SKIP, skip those, too

      ; metadata
      [AutoPrereqs]       ; find prereqs from code
      skip = ^t::lib

      [Authority]
      authority = cpan:DAGOLDEN
      do_munging = 0

      [MinimumPerl]   ; determine minimum perl version

      [MetaNoIndex]       ; sets 'no_index' in META
      directory = t
      directory = xt
      directory = examples
      directory = corpus
      package = DB        ; just in case

      [GithubMeta]        ; set META resources
      remote = origin

      [MetaProvides::Package] ; add 'provides' to META files

      [UploadToCPAN]      ; uploads to CPAN

      ; after release
      [Git::Commit / Commit_Dirty_Files] ; commit Changes (as released)

      [Git::Tag]          ; tag repo with custom tag
      tag_format = release-%v

      ; NextRelease acts *during* pre-release to write $VERSION and
      ; timestamp to Changes and  *after* release to add a new {{$NEXT}}
      ; section, so to act at the right time after release, it must actually
      ; come after Commit_Dirty_Files but before Commit_Changes in the
      ; dist.ini.  It will still act during pre-release as usual

      [NextRelease]
      [BumpVersionAfterRelease]

      [Git::Commit / Commit_Changes] ; commit Changes (for new dev)

      [Git::Push]         ; push repo to remote
      push_to = origin

USAGE
    To use this PluginBundle, just add it to your dist.ini. You can provide
    the following options:

    *   "is_task" — this indicates whether "TaskWeaver" or
        "SurgicalPodWeaver" should be used.

        Default is 0.

    *   "authority" — specifies the "x_authority" field for pause. Defaults
        to 'cpan:DAGOLDEN'.

    *   "auto_prereq" — this indicates whether "AutoPrereqs" should be used
        or not. Default is 1.

        # "auto_version" - this indicates whether "AutoVersion" should be
        used or not. Default is 0.

    *   "darkpan" — for private code; uses "FakeRelease" and fills in dummy
        repo/bugtracker data

    *   "fake_release" — swaps "FakeRelease" for "UploadToCPAN". Mostly
        useful for testing a dist.ini without risking a real release.

    *   "git_remote" — where to push after release

    *   "github_issues" — whether to use github issue tracker. Defaults is
        1.

    *   "stopwords" — add stopword for "Test::PodSpelling" (can be repeated)

    *   "tag_format" — given to "Git::Tag". Default is 'release-%v' to be
        more

        robust than just the version number when parsing versions for
        Git::NextVersion

    *   "weaver_config" — specifies a Pod::Weaver bundle. Defaults to
        @DAGOLDEN.

    *   "version_regexp" — given to Git::NextVersion. Default

        is '^release-(.+)$'

    *   "no_git" — bypass all git-dependent plugins

    *   "no_copy_files" — skip copying Makefile.PL or cpanfile

    *   "no_critic" — omit "Test::Perl::Critic" tests

    *   "no_spellcheck" — omit "Test::PodSpelling" tests

    *   "no_coverage" — omit PodCoverage tests

    *   "no_minimum_perl" — omit "Test::MinimumVersion" tests

    *   "no_bugtracker" — DEPRECATED

    When running without git, "GatherDir" is used instead of
    "Git::GatherDir". and all git check and commit operations are disabled.

    By default, versions are taken/rewritten in the source file using
    "RewriteVersion" and "BumpVersionAfterRelease". If the "auto_version"
    option is true, the version is set by "AutoVersion" and munged with
    "PkgVersion". For "auto_version" the generated "cpanfile" is copied to
    the repo on build; otherwise, "Makefile.PL" is copied.

    This PluginBundle now supports "ConfigSlicer", so you can pass in
    options to the plugins used like this:

      [@DAGOLDEN]
      Test::MinimumVersion.max_target_perl = 5.014
      ExecDir.dir = scripts

    This PluginBundle also supports "PluginRemover", so dropping a plugin is
    as easy as this:

      [@DAGOLDEN]
      -remove = InsertCopyright
