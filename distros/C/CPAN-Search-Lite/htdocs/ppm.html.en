<br><div class=t4> PPM repositories</div>
Consult the documentation that comes with 
<a href="http://www.activestate.com/">ActivePerl</a>
for general directions for using ppm. The ppm packages
that appear here can be installed with the ppm utility.
For the ActivePerl packages, you should just be able to install
the package as <code>install Package-Name</code> from within
the ppm shell; for the other packages, you may have to
add the indicated location to your list of repositories:
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>http://www.bribes.org/perl/ppm</b>, for
the <i>www.bribes.org Perl 5.6 and 5.8 repository</i></li>
<li><b>http://theoryx5.uwinnipeg.ca/cgi-bin/ppmserver?urn:/PPMServer</b>,
for the <i>uwinnipeg Perl 5.6 repository</i></li>
<li><b>http://theoryx5.uwinnipeg.ca/cgi-bin/ppmserver?urn:/PPMServer58</b> (ActivePerl Builds &lt; 819) /
<b>http://theoryx5.uwinnipeg.ca/ppms/</b> (ActivePerl Builds &gt;= 819),  
for the <i>uwinnipeg Perl 5.8 repository</i></li>
</ul>
Make sure that you use a repository appropriate for your
Perl version (5.6 repositories for ActivePerl builds 6xx, and
5.8 repositories for ActivePerl builds 8xx). Also note that
the name of the package that appears here, based on the
CPAN distribution name, is the one to use when installing
a package; this often, but not always, corresponds to the
name of the main module in the package.
