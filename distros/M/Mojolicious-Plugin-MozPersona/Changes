	- Deprecate the default meaning of the "autoHook"/"jquery"
	  option to automatically include the jQuery file that
	  comes bundled with Mojolicious: it is intended for
	  internal use only (kraih)
	- Use functional Mojo::JSON API since the object-oriented
	  API was removed in Mojolicious 5.73; require at least 
	  Mojolicious v4.82, since this was when decode_json was added
