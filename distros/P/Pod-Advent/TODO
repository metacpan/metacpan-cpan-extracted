bookmark http://www.openswartz.com/2010/12/19/perltidy-and-method-happy-together in case we ever need to override  pre-/post-filters in perltidy due to some wonky reserved word collision or syntax addition in a mod99.pl confusing it.

==== ON DECK ====

pod for new (v0.15) pod2advent cmdline options.

option for repeated linking of M<>  (or a new W<> code?)
=over/=item/=back  UL/LI support
support title/author instead of advent_title/advent_author
	use this instead of --noadvent flag?
Add a T<fmt> code (or re-purpose D<>?) for timestamping.

jerrad's multiple P<> usage item
  ==> What is this??
    possibly: make P act like M, and only link the first occurrence??
    ---> check gmail/aim logs

(2009-12-02 9:25:13 PM) Jerrad Pierce: hey. Any idea why paragraphs aren't respected by P::A in begin blocks, like footnotes?


==== IN THE HOLE ====

change __speller() method to a __text_filter() sub that calls &text_filter attribute if it exists.  defaults to sub { __speller }.  lays way for translating subclasses, or html-muckers, or whatever. possibly create a Pod::Advent::Translate (passed a object w/a ->translate() method).
	==> See v0.14 RC's

doc & test case re:  =cut/comment/=pod method of comments.

document that, although Makefile.PL complains, module runs fine w/o Text::Aspell.

Linga::Translate support;  --lang option.

reposition the 'View Source (POD)' link?

pod2advent option to generate template (basically cat ex/getting_started.pod)

pod2advent option to generate css (basically cat style.css)

pod2advent option for 'POD' link vs rel=alternate tag

ability to force html encoding? (see 0.07 changelog entry re: you're)

more tests

test w/more complicated perl samples, for differences in Perl::Tidy versions.

code refactoring (package var usage; also maybe make code/directive behavior based on a config data structure)

support for =over/=item

check html output for validity

custom podchecker (and/or subclass of Pod::Checker)

rewrite with Pod::Simple::Methody ?

------------------
Items from Jerrad:
------------------

process <pre> for pod like A<>?
	(maybe have a new tag?  can a new T<> work multi-line?
	echo -e "=begin pre\n\nA<http://example.com|Test>\n\n=end pre" | perl -Ilib bin/pod2advent +

WISH: better comment support: #lines, and extracting whole <!-- --> clause,
rather than passing it through and hoping the browser parses results correctly.
  ==> See TODO test cases in t/snippets.t

AIM log 2008-12-24:
(8:48:25 PM) Jerrad Pierce: .do P & M interact, so P also only links the first instance of an entity (by date, or |alternateName)?
(8:50:57 PM) David Westbrook: P/M are seperate ..   interesting question re: P -- it doesn't have that link-first-only behvaior that M does, but it easily could
(8:53:30 PM) Jerrad Pierce: it's a rare case, but Yanick's last write-p cited the same old module multiple times
