  The Ruby people have this nice utility called 
  
    gem_server 

  which is a little web server
  that serves up the documentation
  for all the locally installed rubygems.

  It's really handy.

  And then I was left wondering,

    "Why doesn't Perl have something like this???"

      (Apparently, it did...  There's something called Pod::WebServer
       which is a lot like Pod::Server, but I didn't know of its
       existence until after I wrote Pod::Server.)

  Pod::Server is better looking, though.  ;-)
  So try it out.

    pod_server --help

    pod_server -bg '#100' -pbg '#211' -afg '#f44' -ahfg '#fcc'
