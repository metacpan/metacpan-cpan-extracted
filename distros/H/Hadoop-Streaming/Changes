    Use Any::Moose instead of Moose.  This allows users to choose between
    Moose and Mouse.  Is compile and start up actually faster this way?
    As per request from Steve Caldwell @ Campus Explorer.

    Pass @INC to sub-process perl processes while doing testing (so we
    test with the new version, not installed version, of Hadoop::Streaming)

    Improve pod in Hadoop::Streaming by including an example of using
    jar command and hadoop -archives flag.

    Correct Synopsis section in Hadoop::Streaming parent doc, thanks to error report from Frank S Fejes III

    Added documentation --> pod coverage went from 0% to 100%
    Added tests to exercise the example code.
      tests now require Test::Command
