2001-03-06   Gisle Aas <gisle@ActiveState.com>

   Release 1.0.1

   Perl interpreter now destructed when a thread terminates even on
   Windows.

   Avoid direct dependency from perl2.so to Object.so.  This makes it
   much easier to create relocatable binary builds.  Some adjustments
   to the Win32 code because of this.

   Make perlmod.py module thread aware and its PerlModule class now
   provide an wantarray attribute.



2001-03-01   Gisle Aas <gisle@ActiveState.com>

   Release 1.0

   Introduced dbi2.py: A Perl DBI adaptor module that conforms
   to Python's own DB API   

   Introduced perlmod.py: Simplified access to existing Perl
   library modules from Python.

   Added some docstrings.



2001-02-23   Gisle Aas <gisle@ActiveState.com>

   Release 1.0-beta8

   Escape potential safe compartment for perl.defined()
   and perl.get_ref() calls.



2001-02-01   Gisle Aas <gisle@ActiveState.com>

   Release 1.0-beta7

   Introduced RTDL_GLOBAL hack for platforms that use dlopen(3).  After
   this there should not be any need for patching neither perl nor
   python.

   Override pysvrv_nonzero so that len() does not have to lie any more.

   Some prototype changes.



2001-01-11   Gisle Aas <gisle@ActiveState.com>

   Release 1.0-beta6

   Win32 portability tweaks:
      - make sure svrv_object.c is compiled as C++ (by renaming)
      - disable JMPENV code (required internal API not exported on windows)
      - deal with space in the path to python.exe

   Documentation updates (mostly regading MULTI_PERL)

   The dbi.py module does not insist on not working just because
   MULTI_PERL is enabled.



2001-01-03   Gisle Aas <gisle@ActiveState.com>

   Release 1.0-beta5

   Make it possible to pass 'perl ref' objects to python even
   for MULTI_PERL builds.  For this to be safe these objects now
   contain a pointer to perl interpreter that owns them, and the
   objects are only unwrapped when passed to the right interpreter.

   Python::Import() did not release the python lock as it should.

   Fix refcount error for perl.get_ref("@")

   Renamed patches/python-16-dynload-global to python-20-...



2000-12-22   Gisle Aas <gisle@ActiveState.com>

   Release 1.0-beta4

   Implemented Python::Import()

   Implemented Python::exec() and Python::eval()

   Make it possible to boot the symbiosis from perl, i.e. use this
   code base to embed Python in Perl.  This support is still very
   rough.  It is enabled by touching the file 'BOOT_FROM_PERL'
   before building.

   Some Win32 tweaks for Python 2.0



2000-11-14   Gisle Aas <gisle@ActiveState.com>

   Release 1.0-beta3

   Python lists wrapped up in Python::Object now support builtin
   push/pop/shift/unshift/splice and exists.

   Fixed non MULTI_PERL builds.  Did not compile because of missing dTHX
   declarations and a dCTX that expanded to nothing.

   perlsh.py will now use Term::ReadLine.  This allow command line editing.



2000-10-02   Gisle Aas <gisle@ActiveState.com>

   Release 1.0-beta2

   Win32 builds should work now.



2000-09-20   Gisle Aas <gisle@ActiveState.com>

   Release 1.0-beta1

   The alpha zope-perl distribution has now been splitted into two
   different distributions: 'pyperl' and 'zoperl'.  The 'pyperl'
   distribution contains the general stuff for embedding perl in
   python.  There is nothing Zope specific in it.  The 'zoperl'
   distribution depends on 'pyperl' and contains 3 Zope products
   (written in Python) that enable perl for Zope.

   This is the 'pyperl' package.  Techinically this release is
   identical to the 'perl for python' part of zope-perl-0.2.a7.



2000-09-17   Gisle Aas <gisle@ActiveState.com>

   Release 0.2.a7

   Introduced my own thread specific struct; thrd_ctx.[hc]
   It surely needs porting to non-pthread platforms.

   Implemented perl.safecall() and made the other entry points
   able to escape the last compartment and opmask.

   Zope PerlMethods are now compiled and executed inside
   a safe compartment.  PerlMethod icon reverted to old look.

   Added some concurrency tests and others to the test suite.



2000-09-11   Gisle Aas <gisle@ActiveState.com>

   Release 0.2.a6

   The default build flavour of "Perl for Python" is now MULTI_PERL.
   It means that each python thread get its own perl interpreter.
   This avoids the need for a perl lock and allow each the threads to run
   with full concurrency when inside perl.  The downside is that perl data
   can not be passed back to python in this mode.

   Adjusted Zope products to be compatible with MULTI_PERL.

   Added a README file for ZDBI_DA, mostly to explain the connection
   string format.

   Build patch (less hardcoding of perl/python paths)
   by Joseph Wayne Norton <norton@arseed.co.jp>

   Implemented perl.defined() function.

   Implemented Python::id() function.

   Made the PerlMethod icon look more dangerous :-)



2000-08-31   Gisle Aas <gisle@ActiveState.com>

   Release 0.1.a5

   ZDBI_DA can now except multiple statements per query.
   Also implements close() method.  Based on patch from
   Joseph Wayne Norton <norton@alum.mit.edu>.

   The dbi.py file is now installed

   Invoke SETMAGIC after hash updates.  Makes updates to
   tied hashes work.

   Completed ithread-perl support.

   PerlMethod tries to be smart about the size of the editing
   textarea.



2000-08-21   Gisle Aas <gisle@ActiveState.com>

   Release 0.1.a4

   Support builds with perl-5.6 compiled with ithread support.
   But an ithread enabled perl can currently only be invoked from
   the main python thread so it is not usable for Zope yet.

   Disabled dysfunctional 'define_macros' in setup.py

   Introduced two ways of calling python methods with keyword
   arguments from perl $o->foo($pos1, *key => $val) and
   $o->foo($pos1, KW(key => $val))

   Implemented Python::apply($func, \@arg, \%kw)

   Implemented Python::complex($real, $imag)

   Fixed refcount error with Python::Err objects (type object where
   decremented twice in the destructor)

   Reindentation of some C source files.

   Zope PerlMethod now use "Change Perl Method" permissions.
   This also covers PUT method.

   Zope PerlMethods can now be edited through ftp (and possibly WebDAV).
   This is cool as it allow them to be edited in emacs directly.

   Zope PerlMethods now support the document_src method.  It means
   that if you have a perl method that you can access as:

       http://myzope:8080/d/foo

   then you can get back the source of the method as plain (readable)
   perl function with:

      http://myzope:8080/d/foo/document_src



2000-08-14   Gisle Aas <gisle@ActiveState.com>

   Release 0.1.a3

   Moved API methods out of the Python::Object namespace
   and made them plain functions in the Python:: namespace.
   This remove stupid limitation of what real attributes names
   can be used safely with the AUTOLOAD mapping.

   Python::Object constructors are now plain functions like
   long(), list(), dict() in the Python:: namespace.

   Overloading of hash/array/call deref for Python::Object.
   It means $list->[0], @$list, $dict->{foo}, %$dict, and
   $callable->($arg1, $arg2) now all work.

   Python::Err->Raise() is now Python::raise()

   Python::len() and Python::hash() did not croak when an
   exception was raised.

   Force keys of lists and tuples to be interpreted as integers
   for PyObject_{Get,Set,Del}Item

   Python::Object sequence/mapping attributes now unwrap
   in list context.

   PyXXX_Check() functions can now be passed non-Python::Object
   arguments.

   Python::Err::Exception() and sister functions now take an
   optional single argument which is tested against the
   corresponding exception type.  Still not a subclass test as
   it probably ought to be.

   Arguments to Zope PerlMethods are now automatically
   extracted from @_.

   Introduced zope-method.pod

   Various documentation updates.




2000-08-08   Gisle Aas <gisle@ActiveState.com>

   Release 0.1.a2

   Force integer key for {Get,Set,Del}Item on
   sequences.

   Fix building of perlmodule when python is compiled
   without thread support.

   Perl data can now be picked with Storable 0.7.
   Pickling of perl data enabled by loading the
   perlpickle module.

   The setup.py script now requires Distutils-0.9

   Provide python-dynload-global patch for py152

   Introduced try_perlapi.pl

   More ZPublisher provided names in methodTry.dtml.
   Patch by Joseph Wayne Norton <norton@alum.mit.edu>.

   Improved documentation.

   Fix comments on last line of a perl method.
   Patch by Monty Taylor <mtaylor@goldridge.net>.

   Implemented hash.update()



2000-07-27   Gisle Aas <gisle@ActiveState.com>

   Release 0.1.a1

   First public alpha release.
