NAME

    Cwd::utf8 - Fully UTF-8 aware Cwd

VERSION

    version 0.011

SYNOPSIS

        # Using the utf-8 versions of cwd, getcwd, fastcwd, fastgetcwd
        use Cwd::utf8;
        my $dir = getcwd;
    
        # Using the utf-8 versions of abs_path
        use Cwd::utf8 qw(abs_path);
        my $abs_path = abs_path($file);
    
        # Exporting no functions
        use Cwd::utf8 qw(:none); # NOT "use Cwd::utf8 qw();"!
        my $real_path = Cwd::real_path($file);

DESCRIPTION

    While the original Cwd functions are capable of handling UTF-8 quite
    well, they expects and return all data as bytes, not as characters.

    This module replaces all the Cwd functions with fully UTF-8 aware
    versions, both expecting and returning characters.

    Note: Replacement of functions is not done on DOS, Windows, and OS/2 as
    these systems do not have full UTF-8 file system support.

 Behaviour

    The module behaves as a pragma so you can use both use Cwd::utf8 and no
    Cwd::utf8 to turn utf-8 support on or off.

    By default, cwd(), getcwd(), fastcwd(), and fastgetcwd() (and, on
    Win32, getdcwd()) are exported (as with the original Cwd). If you want
    to prevent this, use use Cwd::utf8 qw(:none). (As all the magic happens
    in the module's import function, you can not simply use use Cwd::utf8
    qw())

ATTRIBUTES

 $Cwd::utf8::UTF8_CHECK

    By default Cwd:::utf8 marks decoding errors as fatal (default value for
    this setting is Encode::FB_CROAK). If you want, you can change this by
    setting Cwd::utf8::UTF8_CHECK. The value Encode::FB_WARN reports the
    encoding errors as warnings, and Encode::FB_DEFAULT will completely
    ignore them. Please see Encode for details. Note: Encode::LEAVE_SRC is
    always enforced.

BUGS

    Please report any bugs or feature requests on the bugtracker website
    <https://github.com/HayoBaan/Cwd-utf8/issues>.

    When submitting a bug or request, please include a test-file or a patch
    to an existing test-file that illustrates the bug or desired feature.

COMPATIBILITY

    The filesystems of Dos, Windows, and OS/2 do not (fully) support UTF-8.
    The Cwd function will therefore not be replaced on these systems.

      first added the utf-8 aware versions of Cwd and File::Find to before
      moving them to their own package.
