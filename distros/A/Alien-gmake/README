NAME

    Alien::gmake - Find or build GNU Make

VERSION

    version 0.21

SYNOPSIS

     use Alien::gmake ();
     use Env qw( @PATH );
     
     unshift @ENV, Alien::gmake->bin_dir;
     my $gmake = Alien::gmake->exe;
     system $gmake, 'all';
     system $gmake, 'install';

    Or with Alien::Build::ModuleBuild:

     use Alien::Base::ModuleBuild;
     Alien::Base::ModuleBuild->new(
       ...
       alien_bin_requires => {
         'Alien::gmake' => '0.09',
       },
       alien_build_commands => {
         "%{gmake}",
       },
       alien_install_commands => {
         "%{gmake} install",
       },
       ...
     )->create_build_script;

DESCRIPTION

    Some packages insist on using GNU Make. Some platforms refuse to come
    with GNU Make. Sometimes you just want to be able to build packages
    that require GNU Make without having to check the version of Make each
    time. This module is for that. It uses the system provided GNU Make if
    it can be found. Otherwise it will download and install it into a
    directory not normally in your path so that it can be used when you use
    Alien::gmake. This way you can use it when you need it, but not muck up
    your environment when you don't.

    If possible, it is better to fix the package so that it doesn't require
    GNU make extensions, making it more portable. Unfortunately, sometimes
    this isn't an option.

    This class is a subclass of Alien::Base, so all of the methods
    documented there should work with this class.

METHODS

 exe

     my $gmake = Alien::gmake->exe;

    Return the "name" of GNU make. Normally this is either make or gmake.
    On Windows (and possibly other platforms), it may be the full path to
    the GNU make executable.

    To be usable on all platforms you will have to first add directories
    returned from bin_dir to your PATH, for example:

     use Alien::gmake ();
     use Env qw( @PATH );
     
     unshift @PATH, Alien::gmake->bin_dir;
     system "@{[ Alien::gmake->exe ]}";
     system "@{[ Alien::gmake->exe ]} install";

 bin_dir

     my @dir = Alien::gmake->bin_dir;

    Returns the list of directories that should be added to PATH in order
    for the shell to find GNU make. If GNU make is already in the PATH,
    this will return the empty list. For example:

     use Alien::gmake ();
     use Env qw( @PATH );
     
     unshift @PATH, Alien::gmake->bin_dir;

HELPERS

 gmake

     %{gmake}

    Returns either make or gmake depending on how GNU make is called on
    your system.
