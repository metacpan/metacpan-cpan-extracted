Revision history for Perl extension Math::Symbolic::Custom::CCompiler.

1.04  Wed Jun 05 07:48 2013
  - POD encoding fix

1.03  Tue May 14 19:00 2013
  - Move POD tests to xt/

1.02  Sat Jan  5 11:53 2008
  - Added support for Math::Symbolic 0.509's B_ARCTANGENT_TWO op.

1.01  Wed Sep 14 10:47 2006
  - Added optional POD tests.

1.00  Sat Jul 30 21:43 2005
  - Changed call to _find_vars in the ::Compiler package to a method call
    to explicit_signature() which does basically the same thing. Reason
    is, that I've done this to ::Compiler a while ago an removed
    _find_vars. So no I've learned why you don't just call private
    routines of another package!
