# ----- Example 6 - Spider using "prog" feature -------
#
#  Please see the swish-e documentation for
#  information on configuration directives.
#  Documentation is included with the swish-e
#  distribution, and also can be found on-line
#  at http://swish-e.org
#
#
#  This example demonstrates how to use the
#  new (as of 2.2) "prog" document source feature
#  to spider a webserver.
#
#  The "prog" document source feature allows
#  an external program to feed documents to
#  swish, one after another.  This allows you
#  to index documents from any source (e.g. web, DBMS)
#  and to filter and adjust the content before swish
#  indexes the content.
#
#  This example uses the provided spider.pl program
#  to spider a remote web server.  This spider offers
#  more features than the "http" spider method shown
#  in example7.config.
#
# ** Please don't test with this exact config **
#         spider your own web server
#
#  Indexing (spidering) is started with the following
#  command issued from the "conf" directory:
#
#     swish-e -S prog -c example6.config
#
#  Note: You should have the current Bundle::LWP bundle
#  of perl modules installed.  This was tested with:
#     libwww-perl-5.53
#  Run "perldoc spider.pl" in the prog-bin directory for
#  more information.
#
#  ** Do not spider a web server without permission **
#
#---------------------------------------------------

# Include our site-wide configuration settings:

IncludeConfigFile example4.config

# Specify the program to run
IndexDir ../prog-bin/spider.pl


# When running under the "prog" document source method you can
# pass a list of parameters to the program (specified with -i or IndexDir).

# If a parameter is passed to spider.pl, it will use that as the configuration
# file.

# As a special case, the word "default" followed by URL(s).
# In this case the spider will use default settings to spider the provided URLs.

SwishProgParameters default http://swish-e.org

# Note: the default used by spider.pl is SwishSpiderConfig.pl.
# See prog-bin/SwishSpiderConfig.pl for examples
# that include filtering PDF and MS Word documents.

# Tell swish that about how to parse the content
DefaultContents XML
IndexContents HTML .htm .html
IndexContents TXT .txt .conf



# Just to make it interesting, let's modify the URL that get's indexed:
# replace http://swish-e.org/ => http:/localhost/

ReplaceRules replace swish-e.org localhost


# end of example
