NAME

    Win32::ErrorMode - Set and retrieves the error mode for the current
    process.

VERSION

    version 0.05

SYNOPSIS

     use Win32::ErrorMode qw( :all );
     
     my $error_mode = GetErrorMode();
     SetErrorMode(SEM_FAILCRITICALERRORS | SEM_NOGPFAULTERRORBOX);
     
     system "program_that_would_normal_produce_an_error_dialog.exe";

    If you are using Windows 7 or better:

     use Win32::ErrorMode qw( :all );
     
     # The "Thread" versions are safer if you are using threads,
     # which includes the use of fork() on Windows.
     my $error_mode = GetThreadErrorMode();
     SetThreadErrorMode(SEM_FAILCRITICALERRORS | SEM_NOGPFAULTERRORBOX);
     
     system "program_that_would_normal_produce_an_error_dialog.exe";

    Tie interface:

     # use "if" so that your code will still work on non-windows
     use if $^O eq 'MSWin32', 'Win32::ErrorMode';
     
     # 0x3 = SEM_FAILCRITICALERRORS | SEM_NOGPFAULTERRORBOX
     local $Win32::ErrorMode::ErrorMode = 0x3;
     
     system "program_that_would_normal_produce_an_error_dialog.exe";

    Tie interface thread:

     use if $^O eq 'MSWin32', 'Win32::ErrorMode';
     
     # 0x3 = SEM_FAILCRITICALERRORS | SEM_NOGPFAULTERRORBOX
     local $Win32::ErrorMode::ThreadErrorMode = 0x3; 
     
     system "program_that_would_normal_produce_an_error_dialog.exe";

DESCRIPTION

    The main motivation for this module is to povide an interface for
    turning off those blasted dialog boxes when you try to run .exe with
    missing symbols or .dll files. This is useful when you have a long
    running process or a test suite where such failures are expected, or
    part of the configuration process.

    It may have other applications. It also attempts to smooth over the
    variously incompatible versions of Windows while maintaing binary
    compatibility.

    This module also provides a tied interface $ErrorMode and
    $ThreadErrorMode.

FUNCTIONS

 SetErrorMode

     SetErrorMode($mode);

    Controls whether Windows will handle the specified type of serious
    erros or whether the process wil handle them.

    $mode can be zero or more of the following values, bitwise or'd
    together:

    SEM_FAILCRITICALERRORS

      Do not display the critical error message box.

    SEM_NOALIGNMENTFAULTEXCEPT

      Automatically fix memory alignment faults.

    SEM_NOGPFAULTERRORBOX

      Do not display the windows error reporting dialog.

    SEM_NOOPENFILEERRORBOX

      Do not display a message box when the system fails to find a file.

 GetErrorMode

     my $mode = GetErrorMode();

    Retrieves the error mode for the current process.

 SetThreadErrorMode

     SetThreadErrorMode($mode);

    Same as "SetErrorMode" above, except it only changes the error mode on
    the current thread. Only available when running under Windows 7 or
    newer.

 GetThreadErrorMode

     my $mode = GetThreadErrorMode();

    Same as "GetErrorMode" above, except it only gets the error mode for
    the current thread. Only available when running under Windows 7 or
    newer.

CAVEATS

    GetErrorMode was introduced in Windows Vista / 2008, but will be
    emulated on XP using SetErrorMode, but there may be a race condition if
    you are using threads / forking as the emulation temporarily sets the
    error mode. Then again there is probably a race condition anyway since
    you are using the global version in a threaded application, but you
    should keep this in mind if you must support old versions of Windows.

SEE ALSO

    Win32API::File includes an interface to SetErrorMode, but not
    GetErrorMode. The interface for this function appears to be a side
    effect of the main purpose of the module. The inteface to SetErrorMode
    is not well documented in Win32API::File, but is usable.
