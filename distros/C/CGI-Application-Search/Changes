Revision history for Perl extension CGI::Application::Dispatch.

1.14 (Jul 24, 2012)
    - Allow searches for properties without a full text search.

1.13 (Apr 27, 2010)
    - Fixed broken tests that were using a wrong date pattern [Jason Purdy]

1.12 (Apr 21, 2010)
    - Added FIF_DEFAULTS parameter to control HTML::FillInForm [Brad Oaks]

1.11 (Nov 17, 2009)
    - Better diagnostics when we can't load SWISH::API to be able to track down the reasons [M. Stosberg]
    - If we can't load Search::Tools::HiLiter then just warn and move one without highlighting
    - UTF-8 is now the default.

1.10 (Nov 16, 2009)
    - UTF-8 can now be turned on with UTF8 parameter
    - Using Search::Tools::HiLiter instead of HTML::HiLiter

1.05 (Jan 02, 2007)
    - Can now search on poperties that are false, but still there (I'm thinking of you
      zero)
    - Added SORT_BY configuration param to change the order.

1.04 (Nov 06, 2007)
    - Fixed "associate" regression where data in $self->param wasn't
      getting sent to the templates.
    - Fixed broken Makefile.PL
    - Adding new EXTRA_RANGE_PROPERTIES to the available fields returned in the results

1.03 (Nov 05, 2007)
    - Changed generate_search_query to allow searching when no
      key words are specified. The search can be on other properties
      or for everything listed. NOTE: This breaks backwards compatability
      if you were relying on empty searches returning no results.

1.02 (Nov 05, 2007)
    - Now using swish-e 2.4.5
    - Added EXTRA_RANGE_PROPERTIES

1.00 (Jul 08 2006)
    - Added Test::LongString and Test::Class to build_requires
    - Fixed bug with URL generation not including PATH_INFO
    - Fix bug in Ajax TT template that didn't work in non-ajax browsers

0.10 (Nov 21, 2005)
    - Changes to Makefile.PL to make CPAN installation happier
    - documentation cleanup and clarifications

0.09 (Nov 17, 2005)
    - Default templates now fail more gracefully when the browser doesn't support AJAX
    - no longer need both AJAX and AUTO_SUGGEST to use just the AUTO_SUGGEST functionality
    - Makefile.PL not installs sample templates like Build.PL (this should make CPAN happy)

0.08 (Nov 16, 2005)
    - No code changes, just refactored out the repetitive tests using Test::Class
    - move tests and coverage

0.07 (Nov 13, 2005)
    - No code changes just fixed failing tests when installed via CPAN

0.06 (Nov 12, 2005)
    - added AJAX flag to turn on non-refresh searches
    - added AUTO_SUGGEST, AUTO_SUGGEST_FILE, AUTO_SUGGEST_CACHE and AUTO_SUGGEST_LIMIT
        functionality
    - minor doc fixes
    - fixed mispelling of 'global_var' => 'global_vars' in HTML::Template
        options
    - removed use of callbacks since they didn't really add anything
        and required newer versions of C::A
    - better and more complete sample templates that are installed with
        the application and useable when no others are provided.
    - split tutorial out into a separate file and include some setup
        info for AJAX usage.

0.05 (Jul 10, 2005)
    - renamed 'HIGHLIGHT_CONTEXT' to just 'HIGHLIGHT'
    - removed 'HIGHLIGT_STOP' and 'HIGHLIGHT_START' in favor of
        'HIGHLIGHT_TAG' and 'HIGHLIGHT_CLASS' and 'HIGHLIGHT_COLORS'
    - renamed 'CONTEXT_LENGTH' to 'DESCRIPTION_LENGTH'
    - default highlighting is now done with HTML::HiLiter (much faster)
    - DESCRIPTION_CONTEXT added so that highlighting is now independent of
        finding a matching 'context' inside the description

0.04 (Jul 08, 2005)
    - removed 'hit_' prefix from all vars in in the 'hits' loop for templates
    - almost 100% test coverage (99.6%)

0.03 (Jul 05, 2005)
    - changed from straight H::T to CGI::Application::Plugin::AnyTemplate
        for flexibility
    - better template documentation and minor template fixes
    - more complete test suite, still not 100% coverage, but closer
