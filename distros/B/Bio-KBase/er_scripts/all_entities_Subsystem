=head1 all_entities_Subsystem

Return all instances of the Subsystem entity.

A subsystem is a set of functional roles that have been annotated simultaneously (e.g.,
the roles present in a specific pathway), with an associated subsystem spreadsheet
which encodes the fids in each genome that implement the functional roles in the
subsystem.


Example:

    all_entities_Subsystem -a 

would retrieve all entities of type Subsystem and include all fields
in the entities in the output.

=head2 Related entities

The Subsystem entity has the following relationship links:

=over 4
    
=item Describes Variant

=item Includes Role

=item IsInClass SubsystemClass

=item IsRelevantTo Diagram

=item IsSubInstanceOf Scenario

=item WasProvidedBy Source


=back


=head2 Command-Line Options

=over 4

=item -a

Return all fields.

=item -h

Display a list of the fields available for use.

=item -fields field-list

Choose a set of fields to return. Field-list is a comma-separated list of 
strings. The following fields are available:

=over 4

=item version

=item curator

=item notes

=item description

=item usable

=item private

=item cluster_based

=item experimental

=head2 Output Format

The standard output is a tab-delimited file. It consists of the input
file with an extra column added for each requested field.  Input lines that cannot
be extended are written to stderr.
