NAME
      Net::Domain::TLD - Work with TLD names

SYNOPSIS
      use Net::Domain::TLD qw(tlds tld_exists);

DESCRIPTION
      The purpose of this module is to provide user with current list of 
      available top level domain names including new ICANN additions and ccTLDs
      Currently TLD definitions have been acquired from the following sources:

      http://www.icann.org/tlds/
      http://www.dnso.org/constituency/gtld/gtld.html
      http://www.iana.org/cctld/cctld-whois.htm
      https://www.iana.org/domains/root/db

PUBLIC METHODS
      Each public function/method is described here.
      These are how you should interact with this module.

   "tlds"
      This routine returns the tlds requested.

      my @all_tlds = tlds; #array of tlds
      my $all_tlds = tlds; #hashref of tlds and their descriptions

      my @cc_tlds = tlds('cc'); #array of just 'cc' type tlds
      my $cc_tlds = tlds('cc'); #hashref of just 'cc' type tlds and their descriptions

      Valid types are:
        cc                 - country code domains
        ccidn              - internationalized country code top-level domain 
        gtld_open          - generic domains that anyone can register
        gtld_restricted    - generic restricted registration domains
        gtld_new           - new gTLDs
        new_open           - recently added generic domains
        new_restricted     - new restricted registration domains
        reserved           - RFC2606 restricted names, not returned by tlds

   "tld_exists"
      This routine returns true if the given domain exists and false otherwise.

      die "no such domain" unless tld_exists($tld); #call without tld type 
      die "no such domain" unless tld_exists($tld, 'new_open'); #call with tld type
