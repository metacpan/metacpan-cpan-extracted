=head1 NAME

Astro::STSDAS::Table - access STSDAS format table files

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<Astro::STSDAS::Table> is a collection of routines to read STSDAS
table files (see L<http://stsdas.stsci.edu/STSDAS.html> for more
information on the format).  Casual users should peruse 
B<Astro::STSDAS::Table::Simple>.  

Those requiring a more flexible interface may wish to use
B<Astro::STSDAS::Table::Binary>, which is a subclass of
B<Astro::STSDAS::Table::Base>.

The package currently suffers from the following flaws:

=over 8

=item *

Only binary tables are supported

=item *

Tables can only be read.

=item *

Reading of column-ordered binary tables is untested.

=item *

Reading of binary tables with vector elements is untested.

=item *

These classes were not designed as a drop in replacement for
the STSDAS Table package.  They were designed to simply
read entire tables as is.  As such the design might
not scale well.
