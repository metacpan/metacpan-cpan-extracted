SYNOPSIS

      # Mojolicious::Lite
      plugin 'Host';
    
      # Mojolicious
      $app->plugin('Host');
    
      # remove www. from all hosts
      $app->plugin(Host => { www => 'never' });
    
      # add www. to all hosts
      $app->plugin(Host => { www => 'always' });
    
      # provide your own helper name and use different host helpers
      $app->plugin(Host => { helper => 'host' }); # default
      $app->plugin(Host => { helper => 'www_host', www => 'always' });
      $app->plugin(Host => { helper => 'no_www_host', www => 'never' });
    
      my $raw_host = $app->host;
      my $www_host = $app->www_host;
      my $no_www_host = $app->no_www_host;

DESCRIPTION

    Mojolicious::Plugin::Host allows you to easily access the host for the
    current request. You may use "helper" to change the name of the helper,
    or "www" to modify the host before it is returned.

OPTIONS

 helper

      $app->plugin(Host => { helper => 'host' }); # default
      $app->plugin(Host => { helper => 'www_host', www => 'always' });
      $app->plugin(Host => { helper => 'no_www_host', www => 'never' });
    
      # request to mojolicious.org
    
      # contains mojolicious.org
      my $host = $app->host;
    
      # contains www.mojolicious.org
      my $www_host = $app->host;
    
      # contains mojolicious.org
      my $no_www_host = $app->no_www_host;

    "helper" allows you to set the name of the helper. This can be useful
    for clarity or if you want to use multiple "www" options at once.

 www

      # ensure a www. is always present at the beginning of a host
      $app->plugin(Host => { www => 'always' };
    
      # ensure a www. is never present at the beginning of a host
      $app->plugin(Host => { www => 'never' };
    
      # pass the host through unaltered
      $app->plugin('Host');

    The "www" option allows you to specify how you would like a leading
    www. to be handled before being returned. There are three options:

  always

      # ensure a www. is always present at the beginning of a host
      $app->plugin(Host => { www => 'always' };
    
      # request to mojolicious.org returns www.mojolicious.org
      my $host = $c->host;
    
      # request to www.mojolicious.org returns www.mojolicious.org
      my $host = $c->host;

    "always" will append www. to the beginning of the host if it is not
    there before returning it.

  never

      # ensure a www. is never present at the beginning of a host
      $app->plugin(Host => { www => 'never' };
    
      # request to mojolicious.org returns mojolicious.org
      my $host = $c->host;
    
      # request to www.mojolicious.org returns mojolicious.org
      my $host = $c->host;

    "never" will remove any www. at the beginning of the host before
    returning it.

  unspecified

      # pass hosts through unmodified
      $app->plugin('Host');
    
      # request to mojolicious.org returns mojolicious.org
      my $host = $c->host;
    
      # request to www.mojolicious.org returns www.mojolicious.org
      my $host = $c->host;

    Not specifying "www" will pass hosts through unmodified. This is
    equivalent to calling:

      my $host = $c->req->url->to_abs->host;

METHODS

 host

      # returns host based on the provided options
      my $host = $c->host;

    "host" returns the host for the current request. See "www" for how to
    potentially modify the returned host.

    The name of this method may be changed by using the "helper" option.
