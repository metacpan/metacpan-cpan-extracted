 - Marlin::Struct's magical coercion from arrayrefs is now aware of
   ':Alias'.
 - Marlin::XAttribute::Alias no longer forces PP constructors to be
   generated.
 - Move some attribute logic from Marlin to Marlin::Attribute making it
   easier for attribute extensions to override.

   API (and because it can be useful).

   Moo roles.
 - Provide some useful utility API methods.
