SYNOPSIS

     # in function metadata
     retry => 3,
    
     # more detailed
     retry => {n=>3, delay=>10, success_statuses=>/^(2..|3..)$/},

DESCRIPTION

    This property specifies retry behavior.

    Values: a hash containing these keys:

      * n => INT (default: 0)

      Number of retries, default is 0 which means no retry.

      * delay => INT (default: 0)

      Number of seconds to wait before each retry, default is 0 which means
      no wait between retries.

      * success_statuses => REGEX (default: '^(2..|304)$')

      Which status is considered success.

      * fatal_statuses => REGEX

      If set, specify that status matching this should be considered fatal
      and no retry should be attempted.

      * non_fatal_statuses => REGEX

      If set, specify that status not matching this should be considered
      fatal and no retry should be attempted.

      * fatal_messages => REGEX

      If set, specify that message matching this should be considered fatal
      and no retry should be attempted.

      * non_fatal_messages => REGEX

      If set, specify that message not matching this should be considered
      fatal and no retry should be attempted.

    Property value can also be an integer (specifying just 'n').

    If function does not return enveloped result (result_naked=0), which
    means there is no status returned, a function is assumed to fail only
    when it dies.

    This property's wrapper implementation currently uses a simple loop
    around the eval block.

    It also pass a special argument to the function -retries so that
    function can be aware about retries.
