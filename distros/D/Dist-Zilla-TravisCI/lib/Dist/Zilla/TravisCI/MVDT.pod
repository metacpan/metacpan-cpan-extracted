Dist::Zilla::TravisCI::MVDT - FAQ for Minimum Version Dependency Testing (MVDT)

=head1 INTRODUCTION

=head2 What is MVDT?

MVDT stands for "Minimum Version Dependency Testing".  This is a stress test of your prereqs
that tests the absolute lowest version of your prereqs that they said they would be able
to use.  This includes all of those un-versioned dependencies.  If your prereqs said that
it'll work with B<any version> of Moose, then MVDT will test using Moose 0.01.

=head2 Why bother?

Because your prereqs are a commitment to what versions work and what doesn't from within your
tool.  Far too often, the prereqs end up being un-versioned, and the assumption that B<any
version> of a module will work is typically inaccurate.

Can you claim that the very first CPAN release of Moose will work just fine with your fairly
modern module?  No, probably not.  But, that's exactly what your prereqs said, if you used
Moose and didn't tie a version number to the C<<< use >>> command.

And if the prereqs are inaccurate, you're going to get bug reports that your module doesn't
work because of some weird error.  And it's likely going to take a lot of debugging before
you figure out that the user should upgrade module X.

=head2 Why test the lowest version?  Nobody's going to have that!

Probably not, but we can't accurately say what version people will have.  What we can
accurately say is that a certain percentage of the users will B<NOT> have the latest version.
In fact, in most cases and especially with popular "release often" modules, a large majority
won't.

Some may have modules that are 2-5+ years old, since it came with Perl core, or came with
the operating system's package of Perl (or some other module), or came as a dependency for
some module they grabbed from CPAN several years ago.  You can't tell.  The only thing we
can tell is what the prereqs recommend.

=head2 Why not just use LatestPrereqs?

Some users prefer to download as little from CPAN as they need to, and keep their Perl
requirements in the same place as their OS requirements.  For example, Debian's apt system
has thousands of Perl modules, with all of the proper requirements and dependencies, thanks
to the L<Debian Perl Group|http://pkg-perl.alioth.debian.org/>'s work to translate those
Perl modules to Debian packages.  This keeps OS dependencies clean and makes upgrades
seemless.

By maintaining accurate minimum prereqs, you can find a good happy medium between making sure
your module works for the right version ranges, and not promoting overly restrictive version
requirements.

=head2 Why is this built into a CI module?

Because a CI environment is the perfect testbed to install old versions of modules without
affecting your work environment or anything else.  Travis CI is an especially good choice
because of the way they use "throwaway VMs" and Perlbrew.

=head2 Okay, I'm sold.  What am I getting into?

Well, a lot, actually.  I won't lie; MVDT can be a royal PITA.  You will be going through
a lot of cycles like this:

    * Start a chainsmoke
    * Wait for TravisCI to start and finish your testing
    * Try to identify the offending module dep
    * Try to figure out which version it should be elevated to
    * Add/change the module version in your code
    * ...repeat, repeat, repeat...

However, both L<TravisYML|Dist::Zilla::Plugin::TravisYML> and this guide will try to help you
out as much as possible.

=head2 If it takes a while to get through it, it is really worth the effort?

In the end, yes.  Remember that the hard part is going to be the first time you go through it.
The real reward is B<AFTER> you finish through that initial stage and finally get a working
PASS from Travis CI B<WITH> MVDT turned on.  You should keep MVDT on at that point, and it will
continue to check that your code is working under the bare minimum modules.

Let's say at some point you have a need for the C<<< first_index >>> function from L<List::MoreUtils>.
Beforehand, you were just using C<<< notall >>> and C<<< uniq >>>.  So, you had your C<<< use >>> statement set to
C<<< List::MoreUtils 0.10 >>>.  But, L<List::MoreUtils> didn't introduce C<<< first_index >>> (as an alias of
C<<< firstidx >>>) until C<<< 0.12 >>>.

However, the TravisCI chainsmoking found the problem.  (Provided that you're actually testing that
portion of the code...)  You get the failure, fix the version problem, and catch it before it's
released.  And that's probably one less bug report you'll get.

=head1 THE PROCESS

=head2 How do I start?

Your first steps should be as follows:

=over

=item 1.

B<Make sure your branch is clean and passing tests.>  We don't want to any bugs of yours
throwing you off course.

=item 2.

B<Start a new topic branch!>  As indicated earlier, there will be a lot of testE<sol>change cycles.
You're better off creating a new topic branch, like C<<< topic/mvdt >>>, rebasing the huge batch of
commits into one, and then merging it into master.

=item 3.

B<Configure the TravisYML plugin.>  This also includes making sure you L<turn TravisCI on for your distro|http://about.travis-ci.org/docs/user/getting-started/>.

=item 4.

B<Run C<<< dzil chainsmoke --mvdt >>>.>  The C<<< chainsmoke >>> command was practically designed for MVDT.

=item 5.

B<Don't be impatient!>  Don't run the command more than once (until after TravisCI has finished
and you've adjusted your code).  Remember that L<Travis CI has queues|http://travis-ci.org/>.
This is a free service, after all.

=item 6.

B<Pray that it works the first time.>  (It won't.  If it does, I would question your test
platform...)

=back

=head2 Okay, I found a failure.  Now what?

First, identify the module.  The chances are good that the error message is of the C<<< Can't
locate object method >>> variety.  If not, then something within the module or object will
complain.  If you don't recognize the module as a prereq of yours, you may want to litter
your tests with L<Devel::SimpleTrace> or similiar to ensure that the failures give you a
full path.  Something in that path has to be the module failure point.

Now, you'll need a better version to use.  Check L<BackPAN|http://backpan.perl.org/> and
L<MetaCPAN|http://metacpan.org/>.  If you're lucky, the module doesn't have that many versions
and you can just try the next one up.  If not, there are some ways of figure out where to
go next:

=over

=item *

Some module writers will clearly indicate when a method came into existence.
L<Module::CoreList> is a good example.

=item *

Sometimes you can find L<various|version/DESCRIPTION> L<clues|https://metacpan.org/source/RJBS/Dist-Zilla-Plugin-Git-1.121820/lib/Dist/Zilla/Plugin/Git.pm#L19>
showing you a pretty good idea where you should start your minimum version.

=item *

If it's a rather mature module, say, already into major version 2, then start at 1.00.

=item *

The L<MinimumPrereqs|Dist::Zilla::Plugin::MinimumPrereqs> module can at least elevate your
requirements by year.  This will keep the modules within a certain date threshold.

=item *

In fact, use the whole L<@Prereqs|Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Prereqs> bundle.  That will also
include L<PrereqsClean|Dist::Zilla::Plugin::PrereqsClean>, which will reduce what you actually
need to test.

=item *

If all else fails, just use the L<binary search method|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm>
and pick a version in the middle.

=back

Once you have your version, you actually don't need to change it within, say, the L<Prereqs|Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Prereqs>
plugin.  Just put it in one of your C<<< use >>> statements and L<AutoPrereqs|Dist::Zilla::Plugin::AutoPrereqs>
will pick up the change.

Commit that change and re-run the C<<< chainsmoke >>> command.
