      - Minor optimizations to Term::CLI::Argument::Enum cache.

    Term::CLI, Term::CLI::Command::Help
      - Move pager logic from `Help` command to `CLI` object (add
        `write_pager` method).

    CLI::Base
      - Move `parent` and `root_node` to CLI::Base.

    [Bug fixes]

    Term::CLI::ReadLine

    Term::CLI::Command::Help
      - Fix missing ')' in help text.

    [Documentation fixes]

    - Change references in documentation from M6::CLI
      to Term::CLI [djerius]

    - Miscellaneous POD fixes.

    [Miscellaneous]

    - Lower dependency on Term::ReadKey for older system Perls.

0.056001 -- 2022-04-12

    [Enhancements]

    Term::CLI::Command, Term::CLI::Command::Help,
    Term::CLI::Element, Term::CLI::Role::CommandSet

    - Consistent state between `processed` and `validate`/`execute`
        The state passed to `complete` and `execute_command` (and, by extension
        the argument's `validate` methods) differs in subtle ways. Try to make
        them more consistent by:
        
          * For `complete`: the `processed` key in the state information
            now points to a list of hashes instead of strings.
            The hashes have an `element` key (ref. to relevant command or
            argument object) and a `value` key (the literal value provided
            in the inpug).
        
          * For `execute_command` and `validate`: the state given to these
            methods now also contains a `processed` key.
            Semantics are the same as for `complete`, except that the
            `value` keys of the elements contain the *validated* values, i.e.
            they can be converted, expanded, or otherwise normalised.

    [Bug fixes]

    - Term::CLI::Command
        POD fix: reference to "execute" -> "execute_line".

    - Term::CLI::Tutorial
        Convert TABs to spaces.

0.055002 -- 2022-02-14

    [Bug fixes]

    - benchmarks/grep_vs_search.pl
        Fix duplicate '-i' option in `grep_vs_search.pl`.

    - t/*
        Work around GNU readline interaction with xterm. Tests can fail if GNU
        readline is told to use STDIN/STDOUT: it may inadvertently output a
        `ESC-[?1034h` sequence ("interpret Meta key, enable 8-bit input"), which
        does not play well with our `Test::Output` tests.
        
        To avoid this, we specify `filehandles => []` to the `Term::CLI`
        constructor.

        So far this only manifested itself on OpenBSD 7.0, and only on the
        i386 build of that. Still, I want my tests to pass...

    [Building / Testing]

    - Leave POD test prereqs out of the distribution.
    - Improve test coverage (also add tests for `Term::CLI::Util`).
    - Fix enviroment testing for skipping tests.
        The `Test::Class` `SKIP_ALL` method does not work as advertised.

    [Enhancements]

    Term::CLI::Util
        Make find_* routines a little faster. The `last if ...` check
        when iterating over possible matches is not necessary. A simple
        unqualified `last` will do.

    Term::CLI::Argument::Filename
        - Promote `_glob_complete` to `glob_complete`.

0.055001 -- 2022-02-12

    [Enhancements]

    - Context-sensitive Completion / Validation
        `complete` methods now receive a second argument: a HashRef
        with "state" information that includes the preceding words on
        the command line (in the `$state->{processed}` ArrayRef) and a
        collection of options seen so far (in the `$state->{options}`
        HashRef).

        Argument validators also receive a "state" parameter HashRef
        (although it has a different different structure than that of
        `complete`, see documentation).

        See the demo script in `examples/context_sensitive_completion/`.

    - Dynamic Enum Arguments
        The `value_list` of Term::CLI::Argument::Enum objects now accepts
        a CodeRef, which will be called when the list of values needs
        to be fetched.

        The new `values` method returns the actual list of values.

        The `cache_values` boolean attribute can be used to to execute
        the list expansion only once.

        The tutorial has been updated to include this.

    - Dynamic Command Lists
        The `commands` argument of Term::CLI and Term::CLI::Commands
        objects (through Term::CLI::Role::CommandSet) now accepts a
        CodeRef, which will only be called the first time the command
        list is needed.  This allows for delayed command building,
        which, if used in deeper levels of a command hierarchy, can
        reduce start-up time.

        A new `delete_command` method allows for dynamic command
        hierarchies [RFE#16].  See `examples/dynamic_commands.pl` for
        a demo of this.

    - New `state` attribute for Term::CLI and Term::CLI::Command
        These classes now use a new role called Term::CLI::Role::State
        that provides a "state" HashRef that can be used to store
        application-specific state.

    - Term::CLI
        Create a ReadLine object that uses `STDIN` and `STDOUT`
        by default, instead of letting (Gnu) ReadLine find and open
        the TTY separately.  This ensures that:

            perl readline_app < input_file

        - will actually read input from `input_file`, while also
        making sure that whatever encoding you have on the standard I/O
        handles (e.g. `use open qw(:std :utf8)`) will also be applied
        to ReadLine's I/O.  This means that Estonians can write "tõsi"
        for "true" and Macedonians can write "лажни" for "false".

    - Term::CLI::Argument::Boolean
        Completions now match the case of the partial text, so "TR"
        gets completed to "TRUE" instead of "TRue".

    - Term::CLI::Role::CommandSet
        Command lists are now always sorted by name internally.  This
        allows for optimised searching/matching.

    - Term::CLI::Argument::Enum
        Value lists are always sorted internally.  This allows for
        optimised searching/matching, see also examples/big_enum.pl

    [New]

    - Term::CLI::Util
        New module with a few utility functions for other modules.

    - Term::CLI::Role::State
        A `Moo::Role` that adds a `state` hash to objects.
        See examples/state_demo.pl.

    - benchmarks/*
        A few scripts with benchmarks for different approaches to
        particular algorithms.

    - examples/cli_context.pl
        Demo script for CLI context (provided by djerius).

    [Tests]

    - Various updates and fixes to test the new functionalities.

    [Bug Fixes]

    - Term::CLI::Argument::Bool
        - Fix case-sensitive completion (used `lc` where we shouldn't).
        - Fix test cases for case-insenstive (enum) completion.

    - tutorial/example_17_suspend.pl
        Don't suspend if there was an error on the command line input.

    - Fix Boolean bug in tutorial (and accompanying code).
        We specified "1" as a valid value for "false"; that should be "0".

    [Miscellaneous]

    - Eliminate unnecessary `shift` of function argument in favour
      of assigning from `@_`.

    - Improve Dutch translation of "unknown (sub-)command"

    - Fix dependency on Test::MockModule so it builds on FreeBSD 12.

    - POD fixes and updates.

    - Term::CLI::Command
        Modify error message for invalid arguments for readability.

0.054002 -- 2022-01-05

    [Testing]
    - Fix test for help command.
        Take into account that help text can be rendered using overstrike.

0.054001 -- 2022-01-04

    [Code Cleanup]
    - Tests and modules pass perlcritic's "stern" (-4) filter.
    - Apply perltidy.
    - Properly localise %SIG in `readline`.
    - POD fixes.
    - Remove unnecessary `else` and `elsif`.
    - Run code through perltidy.
    - Eliminate some unnecessary else/elsif.
    - Remove default export of `loc` from `Term::CLI::L10N`
        Explicitly import `loc` in all modules that need it.
    - Do not use `package Foo {}` syntax.
        All modules have only one `package`, so the block syntax
        doesn't add anything and causes perltidy to unnecessarily
        indent all code.

    [Enhancements]
    - Improve filename completion for non-GNU readline
        The glob variation now uses a trick when completing directory
        names that prevents the readline module from adding a space.

        Files modified:
            lib/Term/CLI/Argument/Filename.pm

    - Add CONTRIBUTING.md, Contributors; fix README

    - Add a `clear_error` method to Term::CLI::Base
      and use it instead of `set_error('')`.


    [Bug Fixes]
    - Fix potential bug in line splitting (Term::CLI).

    - Work around for old Pod::Text::Termcap, closes #12
        Versions of `Pod::Text::Termcap` before 4.11 had a bug (#124447)
        that resulted in it using a screen width of 80, regardless of what
        was specified in the constructor call or environment. As a result,
        the high `=over` indents could cause very strange output or even
        make `Pod::Text::Termcap` spin into an eternal loop.

        To make life easier for those with older Perl installations,
        we test for the older `Pod::Text::Termcap` version and use
        `Pod::Text::Overstrike` instead if necessary. The overstrike
        variant does not contain the screen width bug, although it does
        require a pager that understands overstrike sequences. The default
        pager for `Term::CLI` (`less`) does, so the invonvenience should
        be minor.

        Thanks to djerius for reporting and diagnosing the problem.

    [Compatibility]

    - Fix versions of used modules for Perl 5.14.1
        If we claim to to be compatible with Perl 5.14, then we should
        make sure that the minimum required version of modules included
        in the default distribution match up with what we require.

        Files modified:
            lib/**/*.pm
            t/**/*.t

    - Use `bsd_glob` instead of `:bsd_glob`
        `File::Glob` in Perl 5.14 didn't have the `:bsd_glob` tag yet.
        Since we only need the `bsd_glob()` function, just import the
        function.

        Files modified:
            lib/Term/CLI/Argument/Filename.pm

    [Bug Fixes]

    - Term::CLI::ReadLine
        - Make sure Term::ReadKey uses a "TTY" filehandle.
          In cases of e.g. automated runs, STDIN and STDOUT may be
          redirected. `Term::ReadLine` can handle that, `Term::ReadKey`
          cannot, so we need to be explicit.

    - Minor POD fixes.

    [Packaging]

    - Remove author tests from MANIFEST.SKIP

0.053002 -- 2021-12-23

    [Packaging]

    - Fix MANIFEST.

0.053001 -- 2021-12-22

    [Features]

    - Now indepenent of Term::ReadLine implementation
        I.e. compatible with Term::ReadLine::Perl and Term::ReadLine::Stub
        as well (though Term::ReadLine::Gnu is still the best supported).

    - Improved signal handling:
        - Add `ignore_keyboard_signal`.
        - Ignore QUIT control sequence (makes ::Gnu behave like ::Perl).

    - Allow Term::CLI::Argument::Enum values to be provided dynamically
        Term::CLI::Argument::Enum's value_list attribute may be a coderef,
        which should return an array reference of valid values.
        (Pull request #13 from djerius/dynamic-enum.)

    - Add "cleanup" attribute.

    [Tutorial]

    - Formatting fixes.
    - Add SIGNAL HANDLING section.
    - Add HISTORY HANDLING section.
    - Add tutorial/example_17_suspend.pl
    - Use `local($SIG{...})` in `sleep` command.

    [Refactoring]

    - Move most history logic to Term::CLI::ReadLine
        Term::CLI::ReadLine is much more of a compatibility layer
        between Term::CLI and Term::ReadLine now, providing compatibility
        code to compensate for missing functionality in the underlying
        Term::ReadLine implementation.

    [Bug Fixes]

    - Fix Enum validation - closes #10
        Enum validation finds potential matches to an argument by performing
        prefix comparison against the list of valid values. This works fine
        as long as the valid values are not prefixes of each other; if they
        are, then the shorter strings will never be considered valid input.

    - GNU ReadLine - exclude prompt ornaments for leading/trailing whitespace.
        The Term::ReadLine::GNU implementation will just slap the prompt
        between the ornament-start/ornament-end sequences, but this looks
        ugly if there are leading/trailing spaces and the ornament is set
        to e.g. underline or standout. This is now brought in line with how
        the Term::ReadLine::Perl implementation handles it, by inserting
        relevant escape sequences where necessary.

    [Packaging]

    - Various build fixes.
    - Remove prereq on Term::ReadLine::Gnu.

0.052002 -- 2021-05-19
    - Packaging fixes.
    - POD fixes.
    - Get rid of `Modern::Perl` dependency (add `Term::CLI::PerlFeatures`)

    - Force use of `Term::ReadLine::Gnu`
        `Term::ReadLine` *always* looks at the `PERL_RL` environment variable.
        This is a problem if your applications depends on not just
        `Term::ReadLine`, but features of `Term::ReadLine::Gnu` in particular.

        The way we can force the issue, is to make sure we override `PERL_RL`
        before loading `Term::ReadLine`.

        The workaround only works if `Term::ReadLine` has not been loaded by
        another module yet.

        Hopefully, this fixes the CPAN tests on FreeBSD as well.

        newly created Term::ReadLine object is of the "::Gnu" variety.
        If not, it will call "Carp::confess()".

    - Separate STDOUT/pager output for help a bit more.
        Also, set "status" to $? regardless of close() result.
        Some tests for status still fail, and I'm suspecting a
        race condition, making close() return "true". If this
        fails as well, then I'll just skip the test. :-(

    - Require specific versions of modules.
        Minimal versions come from Debian jessie (8) install. Wheezy has
        a version of "Moo" that is too old.

    - Don't check STDERR on pager error.
        Something's off in checking STDERR when running an external
        pager. Could be race condition? Anyway, we only care about
        propagation of the exit status, so just test that.

        Tests work in my dev. environment, but fail about 30-50% of
        the time on CPAN testers.

  [Features]

    - Allow empty "pager" (dump to STDOUT)
        Instead of falling back to "cat", fall back to
        raw STDOUT printing. An empty pager list will
        select STDOUT as well.

    - Fix various (POD and diagnostic message) typos.

    - Don't use POSIX's strtod() and strtol() for number conversions;

      message instead.
