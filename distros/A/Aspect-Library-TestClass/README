NAME
    Aspect::Library::TestClass - give Test::Class test methods an IUT
    (implementation under test)

SYNOPSIS
      # append IUT to params of all test methods in matching packages
      # place this in your test script
      aspect TestClass => call qr/::tests::/;

SUPER
    Aspect::Modular

DESCRIPTION
    Frequently my "Test::Class" test methods look like this:

      sub some_test: Test {
         my $self = shift;
         my $subject = IUT->new;
         # send $subject messages and verify expected results
         ...
      }

    After installing this aspect, they look like this:

      sub some_test: Test {
         my ($self, $subject) = @_;
         # send $subject messages and verify expected results
         ...
      }

    In the test class you must add one *template method* to provide the
    class of the IUT:

      sub subject_class { 'MyApp::Person' }

REQUIRES
    Only works with "Test::Class" above version "0.06_05".

    "XUL-Node" tests use this aspect extensively.
