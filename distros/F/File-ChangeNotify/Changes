0.31   2019-01-09

- No changes from 0.30.


0.30   2018-10-08 (TRIAL RELEASE)

- Added an optional feature to track path attribute changes (permissions,
  ownership) as well as to provide the old vs new attributes and/or content in
  modify events. Both of these features are off by default since they can use
  a lot more CPU or memory, especially when using otherwise low-overhead
  kernel-based watchers.


0.29   2018-09-25

- The change to Module::Runtime in 0.25 wasn't complete so this distro still
  depended on Class::Load.


0.28   2018-02-11

- Fixed handling of the IN_MOVED_TO event for the Inotify watcher. This event
  was being entirely ignored, but we should just treat it as a file creation
  event. Fixed by Aaron Crane. PR #2.


0.27   2017-01-30

- Inflating File::ChangeNotify::Default::Watcher into a Moose object with
  Moose 2.2000 would cause an error or warning because of a bug in how it
  defined an attribute. This broke Catalyst::Restarter.


0.26   2016-05-29

- Require Moo 1.006000+.


0.25   2016-05-28

- Switched from Moose to Moo and Type::Tiny.

- Switched from Class::Load to Module::Runtime.

- Made File::ChangeNotify::Watcher a role instead of a parent class.

- Fixed a bug where the wrong watcher class could be used the second time
  File::ChangeNotify->instantiate_watcher was called.

- Allow the exclude parameter to accept subroutine references. Patch by
  H. Merijn Brand. RT #114492.


0.24   2013-11-28

- Removed used of deprecated Class::MOP::load_class().


0.23   2013-01-26

- The new_events() watcher method blocked when using IO::Kqueue as the watcher
  backend. Reported and patched by Jun Kuriyama.


0.22   2012-04-13

- Remove unnecessary Perl 5.10 requirement.


0.21   2012-02-03

- The implementation of the exclude feature did not work properly in several
  cases. First, for the Inotify and KQueue watchers, when a new directory was
  created that should have been excluded, it was not. Second, it didn't work
  for files at all for these watchers. Reported by Jon Swartz. RT #73089.


0.20   2011-04-19

- The KQueue watcher checks that a file has a file descriptor to avoid
  watching closed files. Patch by Adreas Voegele.


0.19   2010-10-17

- The all.t test didn't run any tests at all if neither the Inotify nor KQueue
  watchers could be loaded. This was treated as a failure by test
  harnesses. Now we always test the Default class.


0.18   2010-10-15

- Always make a Default watcher object if we cannot load an OS-specific class.

- Add Test::Exception as a test prereq.


0.17   2010-10-04

- Loading File::ChangeNotify always loads the Default watcher class. This will
  give a useful error message if this module's prereqs are not loaded.


0.16   2010-07-12

- Changes to avoid a warning about a useless coercion from future versions of
  Moose.


0.15   2010-07-09

- Add a missing prereq, namespace::autoclean.


0.14   2010-07-08

- Running the tests left behind a lot of temp directories that should have
  been cleaned up, but weren't. Reported by Peter Edwards. RT #59125.

- License is now Artistic 2.0


0.13   2010-03-28

- Circular symlinks would cause instantiating a watcher to die with an error
  from File::Find. These are now ignored. Reported by Jon Schutz. RT #55883.

- Fixed misspelling of IO::KQueue in auto features. Reported by Jens
  Rehsack. RT #54905.


0.12   2010-01-28

- Added auto_features to the Build.PL, which will give hints on what modules
  to install for KQueue and Inotify support.

- Require Linux::Inotify 1.2+, since 1.1 apparently doesn't work with this
  module. Reported by Michael Grondin. RT #54069.


0.11   2009-12-07

- A test attempted to use Test::Without::Module but this wasn't in the prereq
  list. I've made the test check for the module and skip its tests if the
  module isn't present. Reported by Leon Brocard. RT #52539.


0.10   2009-12-06

- Attempting to instantiate more than one watcher failed if you were on a
  system where one of the watcher subclasses could not be loaded (which is
  basically every system because no system has both inotify and kqueue). Patch
  by Mark Grimes. RT #52477.


0.09   2009-11-09

- This release fixes the excluded-dirs.t under Windows. There are no other
  changes in this release, so there's no need to upgrade if you have 0.08
  installed. Patch by Taro Nishino. RT #51161.


0.08   2009-11-05

- Added a new exclude feature that allows you to excludes files or directories
  outright. Implemented by Dan Thomas. RT #51062.

- Added a KQueue-based watcher written by Dan Thomas. I have no idea if this
  works, as I don't have BSD, but we'll assume he ran the tests on his system
  ;) RT #51062.


0.07   2009-06-29

- Fixed a typo in File::ChangeNotify::Watcher that causes a warning
  with newer versions of Moose. Reported by David Raab. Fixes RT
  #47431.


0.06   2009-06-03

- Created a Makefile.PL from the Build.PL.


0.05   2009-05-17

- Update the Moose::Params::Validate prereq so it requires the version
  we really need (0.08+).

- Removed Cwd and FindBin from our prereq list.


0.04   2009-05-14

- The Default watcher would blow up when a directory it was watching
  was later removed. Reported by Tomas Doran.

- The Inotify watcher would generate two events when a directory it
  was watching was removed, one delete and one unknown, rather than
  just a delete event.


0.03   2009-05-11

- Removed the default value for directories in the Watcher class,
  because setting this value is really an app-specific task.


0.02   2009-05-10

- Not having Linux::Inotify2 caused attempting to make a watcher blow
  up, when it should just use the Default watcher. Reported by Florian
  Ragwitz.

- Fixes a a bug in the Default watcher that causes it die
  when trying to sleep in the wait_for_events method.

- Fixed warnings from the Default watcher in the face of symlinks that
  point to nonexistent files.


0.01   2009-05-07

- First version, released on an unsuspecting world.
