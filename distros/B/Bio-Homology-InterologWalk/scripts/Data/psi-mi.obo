The difference in left and right handed absorbance A(l)- A(r) is the signal registered in CD spectra. This signal displays distinct features corresponding to different secondary structures present in peptides, proteins and nucleic acids.

Changes in the fluorescence emission spectrum on complex formation can occur either due to a shift in the wavelength of maximum fluorescence emission or by a shift in fluorescence intensity caused by the mixing of two proteins. The interaction of two proteins causes a shift in the fluorescence emission spectrum relative to the sum of the individual fluorescence spectra, resulting in a difference spectrum [F (complex)-2 F (sum)], which is a measurable effect of the interaction.

def: "The classical two-hybrid system is a method that uses transcriptional activity as a measure of protein-protein interaction. It relies on the modular nature of many site-specific transcriptional activators (GAL 4) , which consist of a DNA-binding domain and a transcriptional activation domain. The DNA-binding domain serves to target the activator to the specific genes that will be expressed, and the activation domain contacts other proteins of the transcriptional machinery to enable transcription to occur. The two-hybrid system is based on the observation that the two domains of the activator need to be non-covalently brought together by the interaction of any two proteins. The application of this system requires the expression of two hybrid. Generally this assay is performed in yeast cell, but it can also be carried out in other organism."

This is accomplished experimentally by excitation with plane-polarized light, followed by measurement of the emission at parallel and perpendicular planes. Since rotational correlation times depend on the size of the molecule, this method can be used to measure the binding of two proteins because the observed polarization increase when a larger complex is formed. A fluorescence anisotropy experiment is normally carried out with a protein bearing a covalently added fluorescent group, which increases both the observed fluorescence lifetime of the excited state and the intensity of the fluorescent signal. Residue modification can be assessed by addition of an antibody which binds to the modified residue and alters the molecular weight of the complex. A variation of this technique has been used to show interaction of a DNA binding protein with another protein. In this case the DNA rather than protein is fluorescently labelled."

To determine the full sequence, the four different chain-terminating dideoxyribonucleosides are used in competition with an excess of deoxyribonucleosides in separate DNA synthesis reactions on the same DNA template. When the products of these four reactions are analysed by electrophoresis in four parallel lanes of a denaturing polyacrylamide gel, the DNA sequence can be derived.

A typical ITC experiment is carried out by the stepwise addition of one of the reactants (~10-6 L per injection) into the reaction cell (~1mL) containing the second reactant. The chemical reaction occurring after each injection either releases or absorbs heat (qi) proportional to the amount of ligand that binds to the protein with a characteristic binding enthalpy (DH). As modern ITC instruments operate on the heat compensation principle, the instrumental response (measured signal) is the amount of power (microcalories per second) necessary to maintain constant the temperature difference between the reaction and the reference cells. Because the amount of uncomplexed protein available progressively decreases after each successive injection, the magnitude of the peaks becomes progressively smaller until complete saturation is achieved. The difference between the concentration of bound ligand in the ith and (i-1)th injections depends on the binding constant Ka and the total ligand injected. The calculations depend on the binding model (number of substrates). Analysis of the data yields DH and DG = -RTlnKa. The entropy change is obtained by using the standard thermodynamic expression DG = DH-TDS." [PMID:11785756]

The spin aligns along the strong magnetic field, but can be changed to a misaligned excited state in response to applied radio frequency (RF) pulses of electromagnetic radiation. When the excited hydrogen nuclei relax to their aligned state, they emit RF radiation, which can be measured and displayed as a spectrum. The nature of the emitted radiation depends on the environment of each hydrogen nucleus, and if one nucleus is excited, it will influence the absorption and emission of radiation by other nuclei that lie close to it. It is consequently possible, by an ingenious elaboration of the basic NMR technique known as two-dimensional NMR, to distinguish the signals from hydrogen nuclei in different amino acid residues and to identify and measure the small shifts in these signals that occur when these hydrogen nuclei lie close enough to interact: the size of such a shift reveals the distance between the interacting pair of hydrogen atoms. In this way NMR can give information about the distances between the parts of the interacting molecule. NMR provides information about interacting atoms thereby permitting to obtain information about macromolecular structure and molecular interactions."

However, depending on the data quality, proteins that are highly homologous to already characterised proteins (greater than 80 to 90% sequence identity) can also be identified. The retrieved sequence are evaluated by mass accuracy of the peptides, matching of additional peptide masses in the MALDI spectrum after accounting for common modifications such as oxidation, acrylamidation of cysteine and missed cleavages and the use of secondary information (apparent isoelectric point and molecular weight). If any ambiguity about the identification by MALDI-MS still exists, the results must verified by an other identification method.

Peptides are routinely synthesised in a test tube from monomeric amino acids by condensation reactions that form peptide bonds. Peptides are constructed sequentially by coupling the C-terminus of a monomeric amino acid to the N-terminus of the growing peptide. To prevent unwanted reactions involving the amino groups and carboxyl groups of the side chains during the coupling steps, a protecting (blocking) group is attached to the side chains.

Retentate chromatography is performed on ProteinChip Arrays with varying chromatographic properties (e.g. anion exchange, cation exchange, metal affinity and reverse phase). By utilising arrays with differing surface chemistries in parallel and in series, a complex mixture of proteins, as from cells or body fluids, can be resolved into subsets of proteins with common properties. Specific analytes can also be examined by using preactivated arrays to which a bait molecule (such as an antibody or biotinylated DNA) is immobilized and a solution containing the binding partner(s) is presented to the array. This array-based immunoprecipitation or protein-binding experiment has been used with good success to study DNA-binding proteins, receptor-ligand interactions, and protein complexes. Any ligand retained on a SELDI chip can directly be identified by mass spectrometry." [PMID:11827829]

As a first step a cDNA library is constructed that encodes chimeric proteins in which the natural proteins or protein domains are fused to a C-terminal tether. As a consequence when the mRNA is translated in vitro the domain can fold while the tether is still in the ribosomal tunnel. Furthermore this chimeric mRNAs lack a stop codon, thus preventing release of the mRNA and the polypeptide from the ribosome. High concentrations of magnesium and low temperature further stabilise the ternary complex. Similarly to phage display, these complexes can be used directly to select for nucleic acids encoding proteins with desired properties." [PMID:11551470, PMID for application instance:12167034]

def: "This approach leads to protein identification by combining mass measurement and short amino acid sequence information obtained by tandem mass spectrometry. This information is then used to automatically find the best match in a sequence database. A mixture of peptides derived from a protease digestion is analysed by nanoelectrospray LC-MS/MS (Liquid Chromatography Tandem Mass Spectrometer or nanoESI MS/MS) mass spectrometry. Electrospray mass spectrometry cannot be applied to dilute samples and is affected by high salt. As a consequence peptides, normally extracted from acrylamide gels by in situ proteolysis, are desalted and concentrated on a microcolumn followed by elution into a capillary used for nanoelectrospray tandem mass spectrometry. A first mass spectrum (Normal mass spectrum or Q1 mass spectrum) gives information about the masses of all the peptides. Peptides observed in the normal mass spectrum are isolated in turn and dissociated into fragments by collision with gas molecules within the mass spectrometer. Some of the fragments obtained from a peptide constitute a nested set, differing by one amino acid, and the mass difference between them allows assignment of a partial sequence. The masses of the fragments define the position of the partial sequence in the peptide. Together with the cleavage specificity of the protease used to cleave the protein, and mass information such sequence tag provides much higher search specificity to match the a database entry. The procedure is repeated with several peptides from the digest, resulting in multiple identifications of the same protein or identification of several proteins from the peptide mixture. Unknown proteins can easily be identified by using the high specificity of the peptide sequence tag for searches in most sequence databases including EST or genome databases."

A ligand of interest (small molecule, peptide, protein, sugar, lipid, nucleic acid) is immobilized on a gold surface, and the interacting partner is injected in buffer flow over it. Biomolecules that interact with the immobilized ligand are retained on the surface, and alter the resonance angle of impinging light as a result of the change in refractive index brought about by the increased biomolecule mass retained on the surface. Since all the biomolecules belonging to the same class have the same refractive index and since there is a linear correlation between resonance angle shift and biomolecule concentration near the surface, this allows one to measure changes in concentration at the surface as a consequence of interaction. Furthermore, this is done in real time, allowing direct measurement of both the on-rate and the off-rate and of the affinity constant of complex formation."

The fusion protein and associated components are recovered from cell extracts by affinity selection on an IgG matrix. After washing, the TEV protease is added to release the bound material. The eluate is incubated with calmodulin-coated beads in the presence of calcium. This second affinity step is required to remove the TEV protease as well as traces of contaminants remaining after the first affinity selection. After washing, the bound material is released with EGTA. This two steps purification steps ensures a highly selective complex purification of the tapped protein (first round of selection on the protein A, a high affinity tag) under mild condition (non denaturant pH or conditions required to remove the tag).\nOBSOLETE redundant term.

A fluorescence assay can also be carried out taking advantage of fMTX binding to reconstituted DHFR. The basis of this assay is that complementary fragments of DHFR, when expressed and reassembled in cells, will bind with high affinity (Kd 5 540 pM) to fMTX in a 1:1 complex. fMTX is retained in cells by this complex, whereas the unbound fMTX is actively and rapidly transported out of the cells.

A small fraction, however, will be scattered by the atoms in the sample. If the sample is a well-ordered crystal, the scattered waves will reinforce one another at certain points and will appear as diffraction spots when the X-rays are recorded by a suitable detector. The position and intensity of each spot in the X-ray diffraction pattern contain information about the position and nature of the atoms in the crystal. The three-dimensional structure of a large molecule can be deduced from the electron-density map of its crystal. In recent years X-ray diffraction analysis has become increasingly automated, and now the slowest step is likely to be the production of suitable macromolecule crystals.

After reversal of the cross-links, the enriched DNA is amplified and labeled with a fluorescent dye (Cy5) by using a ligation-mediatedpolymerase chain reaction (LM-PCR). In parallel a sample of DNA that is not enriched by immunoprecipitation is subjected to LM-PCR in the presence of a different fluorophore (Cy3), and both immunoprecipitation (IP)-enriched and unenriched pools of labeled DNA were hybridized to a single DNA microarray containing a set of intergenic sequences. The ratio of the Cy5 to Cy3 fluorescence intensities measured at each DNA element in the microarray provided a measure of the extent of binding of the transcription factor to the corresponding genomic locus."

RNAi or dsRNA-induced silencing phenomena are present in evolutionarily diverse organisms, e.g., nematodes, plants, fungi, and trypanosomes. The mechanisms by which RNAi works is initiated by a progressive cleavage of dsRNA into 21 to 23 nucleotide (nt) short interfering RNAs (siRNAs). These native siRNA duplexes are then incorporated into a protein complex called RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). ATP-dependent unwinding of the siRNA duplex generates an active RISC complex. Guided by the antisense strand of siRNA, the active RISC complex recognizes and cleaves the corresponding mRNA." [PMID:12110901, PMID:12408823]

The fusion protein and associated components are recovered from cell extracts by affinity selection on an IgG matrix. After washing, the TEV protease is added to release the bound material. The eluate is incubated with calmodulin-coated beads in the presence of calcium. This second affinity step is required to remove the TEV protease as well as traces of contaminants remaining after the first affinity selection. After washing, the bound material is released with EGTA. This tag allows two steps purification steps ensuring a highly selective purification of the tapped protein (first round of selection on the protein A, a high affinity tag) under mild condition (non denaturant pH or conditions required to remove the tag)."

The experiment involves the treatment with DMS of two DNA samples with identical sequence, one protein bound and the other naked. The two samples are treated with piperidine to induce chemical cleavage of the DMS modified guanine residues followed by digestion with restriction enzymes. Once labelled the samples are run in parallel on a gel to visualize the pattern of nested fragments sharing a common end generated by restriction enzyme(or PCR primer extension) and a variable end guanine dependent.

The corresponding target (prey) protein is fused to the N-terminal domain of the alfa-subunit of RNA polymerase (248 amino acids). The bait is tethered to the lambda operator sequence upstream of the reporter promoter through the DNA-binding domain of lambdacI. When the bait and prey interact, they recruit and stabilize the binding of RNA polymerase at the promoter and activate the transcription of the HIS3 reporter gene. Due to the tendency of both the lambda repressor protein and the N-terminal domain of the alfa-subunit of RNA polymerase to dimerize, this system might not be optimal for the analysis of proteins that self-associate unless their interaction with other protein partners depends on the oligomerization."

When a biological interaction between molecules brings the beads into proximity, a cascade of chemical reactions is initiated to produce a greatly amplified signal. Upon laser excitation, a photosensitizer in the Donor bead converts ambient oxygen to a more excited singlet state. The singlet state oxygen molecules diffuse across to react with a chemiluminescer in the Acceptor bead that further activates fluorophores contained within the same bead. The fluorophores subsequently emit light at 520-620 nm. In the absence of a specific biological interaction, the singlet state oxygen molecules produced by the Donor bead go undetected without the close proximity of the Acceptor bead. AlphaScreen has successfully been developed for enzyme assays (kinase, helicase, protease, ...), interaction assays (ligand/receptor, protein/protein, protein/DNA), immunoassays, and GPCR functional assays (cAMP, IP3)."
