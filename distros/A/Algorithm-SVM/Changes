0.12  Sun Jan 15 11:39:00 GMT+1 2006
  - Updated libsvm to 2.81 (i.e. added half a dozen lines of code)
  - added many testcases in test.pl
  - SVM: Added binding for predict_values, improved memory usage
  - DataSet: changed to use sparse format internally
             internal format similar to what libsvm uses
             added asArray function, improved memory usage
  - All changes (except libsvm update which slightly changes the
    learned models) are completely transparent to the user. No
    changes in programs depending on this should be necessary.
