DESCRIPTION
    This is a Template::Toolkit plugin to filter text, replacing sequences
    of characters with corresponding typographic ligatures using
    Text::Ligature.

    When using this filter in HTML templates, one of the following steps
    will also need to be performed in order to properly display these
    Unicode ligatures.

    *   Set the "charset" to "UTF-8" in the HTTP response "Content-Type"
        header

            Content-Type: text/html; charset="UTF-8"

    *   Set the "charset" to "UTF-8" in the HTML "Content-Type" meta element

            <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8">

    *   Convert the ligatures to HTML entities using the "html_entity"
        filter

            [% $content | ligature | html_entity %]
