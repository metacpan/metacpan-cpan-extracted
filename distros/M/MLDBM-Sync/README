      my $value = $cache{"AAAA"};

      # SERIALIZED PROTECTED read/write with explicit lock for both i/o requests

      $sync_dbm_obj->UnLock;

      # MEMORY CACHE LAYER with Tie::Cache
      $sync_dbm_obj->SyncCacheSize('100K');

      # KEY CHECKSUMS, for lookups on MD5 checksums on large keys
      my $sync_dbm_obj = tie %cache, 'MLDBM::Sync', '/tmp/syncdbm', O_CREAT|O_RDWR, 0640;
      $sync_dbm_obj->SyncKeysChecksum(1);

DESCRIPTION
    This module wraps around the MLDBM interface, by handling concurrent
    access to MLDBM databases with file locking, and flushes i/o explicity
    per lock/unlock. The new [Read]Lock()/UnLock() API can be used to
    serialize requests logically and improve performance for bundled reads &
    writes.

      my $sync_dbm_obj = tie %cache, 'MLDBM::Sync', '/tmp/syncdbm', O_CREAT|O_RDWR, 0640;

      # Write locked critical section
      $sync_dbm_obj->Lock;
        ... all accesses to DBM LOCK_EX protected, and go to same tied file handles
        $cache{'KEY'} = 'VALUE';
      $sync_dbm_obj->UnLock;

      # Read locked critical section
      $sync_dbm_obj->ReadLock;
        ... all read accesses to DBM LOCK_SH protected, and go to same tied files
        ... WARNING, cannot write to DBM in ReadLock() section, will die()
        ... WARNING, my $v = $cache{'KEY'}{'SUBKEY'} will trigger a write so not safe
        ...   to use in ReadLock() section
        my $value = $cache{'KEY'};
      $sync_dbm_obj->UnLock;

      # Normal access OK too, without explicity locking
      $cache{'KEY'} = 'VALUE';
      my $value = $cache{'KEY'};

    MLDBM continues to serve as the underlying OO layer that serializes
    complex data structures to be stored in the databases. See the MLDBM the
    BUGS manpage section for important limitations.

    MLDBM::Sync also provides built in RAM caching with Tie::Cache md5 key
    checksum functionality.

INSTALL
    Like any other CPAN module, either use CPAN.pm, or perl -MCPAN "-e"
    shell, or get the file MLDBM-Sync-x.xx.tar.gz, unzip, untar and:

      perl Makefile.PL
      make
      make test
      make install

LOCKING
    The MLDBM::Sync wrapper protects MLDBM databases by locking and
    unlocking around read and write requests to the databases. Also
    necessary is for each new lock to tie() to the database internally,
    untie()ing when unlocking. This flushes any i/o for the dbm to the
    operating system, and allows for concurrent read/write access to the
    databases.

    Without any extra effort from the developer, an existing MLDBM database
    will benefit from MLDBM::sync.

      my $dbm_obj = tie %dbm, ...;
      $dbm{"key"} = "value";

    As a write or STORE operation, the above will automatically cause the
    following:

      $dbm_obj->Lock; # also ties
      $dbm{"key"} = "value";
      $dbm_obj->UnLock; # also unties

    Just so, a read or FETCH operation like:

      my $value = $dbm{"key"};

    will really trigger:

      $dbm_obj->ReadLock; # also ties
      my $value = $dbm{"key"};
      $dbm_obj->Lock; # also unties

    However, these lock operations are expensive because of the underlying
    tie()/untie() that occurs for i/o flushing, so when bundling reads &
    writes, a developer may explicitly use this API for greater performance:

      # tie once to database, write 100 times
      $dbm_obj->Lock;
      for (1..100) {
        $dbm{$_} = $_ * 100;
        ...
      }
      $dbm_obj->UnLock;

      # only tie once to database, and read 100 times
      $dbm_obj->ReadLock;
      for(1..100) {
        my $value = $dbm{$_};  
        ...
      }
      $dbm_obj->UnLock;

CACHING
    I built MLDBM::Sync to serve as a fast and robust caching layer for use
    in multi-process environments like mod_perl. In order to provide an
    additional speed boost when caching static data, I have added an RAM
    caching layer with Tie::Cache, which regulates the size of the memory
    used with its MaxBytes setting.

    To activate this caching, just:

      my $dbm = tie %cache, 'MLDBM::Sync', '/tmp/syncdbm', O_CREAT|O_RDWR, 0640;
      $dbm->SyncCacheSize(100000);  # 100000 bytes max memory used
      $dbm->SyncCacheSize('100K');  # 100 Kbytes max memory used
      $dbm->SyncCacheSize('1M');    # 1 Megabyte max memory used

    The ./bench/bench_sync.pl, run like "bench_sync.pl "-c"" will run the
    tests with caching turned on creating a benchmark with 50% cache hits.

    One run without caching was:

     === INSERT OF 50 BYTE RECORDS ===
      Time for 100 writes + 100 reads for  SDBM_File                  0.16 seconds     12288 bytes
      Time for 100 writes + 100 reads for  MLDBM::Sync::SDBM_File     0.17 seconds     12288 bytes
      Time for 100 writes + 100 reads for  GDBM_File                  3.37 seconds     17980 bytes
      Time for 100 writes + 100 reads for  DB_File                    4.45 seconds     20480 bytes

    And with caching, with 50% cache hits:

     === INSERT OF 50 BYTE RECORDS ===
      Time for 100 writes + 100 reads for  SDBM_File                  0.11 seconds     12288 bytes
      Time for 100 writes + 100 reads for  MLDBM::Sync::SDBM_File     0.11 seconds     12288 bytes
      Time for 100 writes + 100 reads for  GDBM_File                  2.49 seconds     17980 bytes
      Time for 100 writes + 100 reads for  DB_File                    2.55 seconds     20480 bytes

    Even for SDBM_File, this speedup is near 33%.

KEYS CHECKSUM
    A common operation on database lookups is checksumming the key, prior to
    the lookup, because the key could be very large, and all one really
    wants is the data it maps too. To enable this functionality
    automatically with MLDBM::Sync, just:

      my $sync_dbm_obj = tie %cache, 'MLDBM::Sync', '/tmp/syncdbm', O_CREAT|O_RDWR, 0640;
      $sync_dbm_obj->SyncKeysChecksum(1);

     !! WARNING: keys() & each() do not work on these databases
     !! as of v.03, so the developer will not be fooled into thinking
     !! the stored key values are meaningful to the calling application 
     !! and will die() if called.
     !!
     !! This behavior could be relaxed in the future.
 
    An example of this might be to cache a XSLT conversion, which are
    typically very expensive. You have the XML data and the XSLT data, so
    all you do is:

      # $xml_data, $xsl_data are strings
      my $xslt_output;
      unless ($xslt_output = $cache{$xml_data.'&&&&'.$xsl_data}) {
        ... do XSLT conversion here for $xslt_output ...
        $cache{$xml_data.'&&&&'.xsl_data} = $xslt_output;
      }

    What you save by doing this is having to create HUGE keys to lookup on,
    which no DBM is likely to do efficiently. This is the same method that
    File::Cache uses internally to hash its file lookups in its directories.

New MLDBM::Sync::SDBM_File
    SDBM_File, the default used for MLDBM and therefore MLDBM::Sync has a
    limit of 1024 bytes for the size of a record.

    SDBM_File is also an order of magnitude faster for small records to use
    with MLDBM::Sync, than DB_File or GDBM_File, because the tie()/untie()
    to the dbm is much faster. Therefore, bundled with MLDBM::Sync release
    is a MLDBM::Sync::SDBM_File layer which works around this 1024 byte
    limit. To use, just:

      use MLDBM qw(MLDBM::Sync::SDBM_File);

    It works by breaking up up the STORE() values into small 128 byte
    segments, and spreading those segments across many records, creating a
    virtual record layer. It also uses Compress::Zlib to compress STORED
    data, reducing the number of these 128 byte records. In benchmarks, 128
    byte record segments seemed to be a sweet spot for space/time
    efficiency, as SDBM_File created very bloated *.pag files for 128+ byte
    records.

BENCHMARKS
    In the distribution ./bench directory is a bench_sync.pl script that can
    benchmark using the various DBMs with MLDBM::Sync.

    The MLDBM::Sync::SDBM_File DBM is special because is uses SDBM_File for
    fast small inserts, but slows down linearly with the size of the data
    being inserted and read.

    The results for a dual PIII-450 linux 2.4.7, with a ext3 file system
    blocksize 4096 mounted async on a RAID-1 2xIDE 7200 RPM disk were as
