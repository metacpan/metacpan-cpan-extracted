0.06    2015-06-18  Released-By: PERLANCAR

        - [Incompatible change] Replace separator() with header() as the latter
          makes more sense when adding multiple parts. header() can be a string
          or a coderef.

        - [ux] The default header() now prints "### <name> ###" so for normal
          cases user does not change the default.
