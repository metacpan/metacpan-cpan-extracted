METHODS

            OO interface

 Graph::ChartSVG->new

      Create a new Chart

      possible parameters are :

  active_size

        an array ref with x,y size of the active graph ( without the reserved border for label )
        
     

  bg_color

      an hex color for the global background color
     

  frame

      a Frame object to surround the active part of the graph

  grid

      a Grid oject to add to the graph
      
      

  overlay

     a Overlay to add on top of the graph ( useful to enhance a period in alarm )
      

  layer

     a Layer object
      

  border

     a Border object ( = some extra space to fit aroubd the active graph to allow label.
                    This increase the actual_size and create the total_size)
     

  tag

     a Tag objet ( if missing create a automatically incremented one )
     

  glyph

     a Glyph object to add on the graph ( like a arrow to point at the end of the current data )
        

    my $graph = Graph::ChartSVG->new( active_size => \@size, bg_color =>
    'FCF4C6', frame => $f, png_tag => 1 );

 Frame->new

  color

     a hex color of the frame
     

  thickness

     thickness of the frame

    my $f = Frame->new( color => 'ff0000', thickness => 3 );

 Border->new

  top

     space between the active part of the graph and the top of the image
     

  bottom

     space between the active part of the graph and the bottom of the image
     

  left

     space between the active part of the graph and the left of the image

  right

    space between the active part of the graph and the right of the image

    my $b = Border->new( top => 200, bottom => 100, left => 80, right =>
    200 );

 $graph->border

    method to add or change a border on the graph

 Data->new

     create a new set of data 
     

  type

     the type of graph used for that data set.
     could be :
     

      * line

      a normal line

      * line_up

      a line with zero starting at the middle of the active graph with
      increasing value in the top direction

      * line_down

      a line with zero starting at the middle of the active graph with
      increasing value in the bottom direction

      * bar

      a filled graph

      * bar_up

      a filled graph with zero starting at the middle of the active graph
      with increasing value in the top direction

      * bar_down

      a filled graph with zero starting at the middle of the active graph
      with increasing value in the bottom direction

      * line_stack

      a set of line stacked under each other

      * line_stack_up

      a set of line stacked under each other with zero starting at the
      middle of the active graph with increasing value in the top direction

      * line_stack_down

      a set of line stacked under each otherwith zero starting at the
      middle of the active graph with increasing value in the bottom
      direction

      * bar_stack

      a set of filled graph stacked under each other

      * bar_stack_up

      a set of filled graph stacked under each other with zero starting at
      the middle of the active graph with increasing value in the top
      direction

      * bar_stack_down

      a set of filled graph stacked under each other with zero starting at
      the middle of the active graph with increasing value in the bottom
      direction

  color

    the hex color of the graph

    if Data is stack type, it should be a array ref with all the hex color

  thickness

    the thickness of the line used

    in bar the thickness of the border

  label

    a label to set to the SVG object

  offset

    a vertical offset ( where the zero start )

   example:

        my $l = Data->new( type => 'line', color => 'ff9800A0', thickness => 3, label => 'oblique' ,  offset    => 50 );

 $l->data_set( ... )

    include a set of data to a Data object

    it is an array ref with all data

    or an array ref of array ref for the stack type of Graph

   example:

      $l->data_set( \@data1 );
      
      

 $graph->add( ... )

    add a element in the graph

    the element could be:

      * data_set

      * Glyph

      * Overlay

   example:

     $graph->add( $l );
     

    method to add an object to a graph

 graph->grid( debord => ..., x => Grid_object, y = > Grid_object, )

        $graph->grid(
    
            Grid->new(

            )
        );
    
     

 $graph->label( label_name);

    search for the layer with the label = label_name

    in array context return ( ref_data, layer_level) in scalar context
    return ref_data

    (ref_data = an array ref with the data set )

     my ( $Mal, $Mlan ) = $graph->label( 'src_all' );
     

 $graph->move( from, to );

    Move a speciied layer to another level.

    the other layer are shifted to allow the insert

 Glyph->new

    3 type of glyph are available:

    'line' draw a polyline or polygon 'text' draw a text 'image' include a
    PNG image Embeded in the SVG

    To draw an arrow:

        my $g1 = Glyph->new(
            x        => $graph->border->left ,  
            y        =>$graph->active_size->[1] +$graph->border->bottom ,       
            type     => 'line',
            filled   => 1,                  # if 1 = fill the polygon ( be sure to correctly close the path )
            color    => '0faFff',
            data_set => [
                {
                    data => [ [ 0, 0 ], [ 8, 10 ], [ 0, 10 ], [ 0, 10 + 20 ], [ 0, 10 ], [ -8, 10 ], [ 0, 0 ] ], # the list of point to create the polyline
                    thickness => 3
                }
            ]
        );

    To write 2 text label ( in one Glyph )

            $g = Glyph->new(
                label =>'label_max',
                x => 100 ,

                font     => 'Verdana',                      # the TrueType font to use
                data_set => [                               # the data set contain an array with all the text to plot followed by the relative position + the optional rotation
                    {
                        text   => "hello text 1",
                        x      => 0,                                # the relative position in x for that specific text
                        y      => 15,                               # the relative position in yfor that specific text
                        anchor => 'end',                                    # the text anchor ( could be  start, middle or end )

                        style => 'oblique'                          # could be      normal (default) ,| italic = oblique
                    },
                    {
                        text =>"Bye text 2",
                        x      => 60,                                # the relative position in x for that specific text
                        y      => 15,                              # the relative position in yfor that specific text

                ],
            );
            
           
     To inlude a PNG image ( the image is encoded with MIME::Base64 )
          
             $g = Glyph->new(
                label => 'port_label',
                x     => $graph->active_size->[0] + $graph->border->left + 250,

                type  => 'image',
                data_set => [    
                    {
                        image  => $img_bin,

                ],
            ); 
            

 $graph>image

    return the SVG image ( to be writed in a file )

        open( my $IMG, '>', $file_svg ) or die $!;
        binmode $IMG;
        print $IMG $graph>image;
        close $IMG;
        

    !!!! This object is only available after the render method !!!!

 $graph->reduce( data => \@dot1, start => 50, end => 360, init => 300 );

    This method allow to create a set of data directly usable a a data_set.
    If there are more plotting value in the input data then the size of the
    graph, use some average to create the plotting dot If there are lower
    plotting value in the input data then the size of the graph, fill the
    gap to smooth the graph data = an array ref with the input data start =
    where the data start in the reduced data ( if missing =0 ) end = where
    the data end in the reduced data ( f missing = end of the active size
    graph ) init = a default value to set the element when there is no data
    to add, like before start or after end ( if missing use undef )

    return a array of 2 element

    The first one contains an array refwith the reduced set of data The
    second a hash ref with the statistic info

    $VAR1 = { 'perc' => 345, 'last_val' => 359, 'avg' => '400', 'min' => 0,
    'last' => 360, 'max' => 800, 'sum' => 320400 };

 $graph->render

    create the SVG from all the objects
