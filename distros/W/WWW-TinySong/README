WWW::TinySong version 1.01
==========================

tinysong.com is a web app that can be queried for a song and returns a tiny
URL, allowing you to listen to the song for free online and share it with
friends.  WWW::TinySong is a Perl interface to this service, allowing you
to programmatically search its underlying database..

INSTALLATION

To install this module, open a terminal in the directory containing the
unarchived source and type:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

This should work on most modern systems assuming you have Perl and a Make
utility installed and configured in the usual way.  The most likely change
you might need to make to the above is replacing the first line with

    perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=~

if you're on a Unix-like OS and wish to install the module in your home
directory.

The `make test' step is optional but recommended to verify that the code
works as expected on your system before proceeding with the install.

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires the following other modules:

  Carp
  Exporter
  CGI
  HTML::Parser
  LWP::UserAgent
