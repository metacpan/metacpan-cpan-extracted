=end HTML

This widget provides a scrollable table implementation for use on larger data
sets. Rather than populating the table with values, you provide an adapter
which implements the C<count> and C<get> methods, and the table widget will
query the adapter for the current "page" of values.

This abstraction should allow access to larger datasets than would fit in
available memory, such as a database table or procedurally-generated data.

See L<Adapter::Async::OrderedList::Array> if your data is stored in a Perl
array. Other subclasses may be available if you have a different source.

=head2 Transformations

Apply to:

=over 4

=item * Row

=item * Column

=item * Cell

=back

=head3 Item transformations

This takes the original data item for the row, and returns one of the following:

=over 4

=item * Future - when resolved, the items will be used as cells

=item * Arrayref - holds the cells directly

=back

The data item can be anything - an array-backed adapter would return an arrayref, ORM will give you an object for basic collections.

Any number of cells may be returned from a row transformation, but you may get odd results if the cell count is not consistent.

An array adapter needs no row transformation, due to the arrayref behaviour. You could provide a Future alternative:

 $row->apply_transformation(sub {
  my ($item) = @_;
  Future->wrap(
   @$item
  )
 });

For the ORM example, something like this:

 $row->apply_transformation(sub {
  my ($item) = @_;
  Future->wrap(
   map $item->$_, qw(id name created)
  )
 });

=head3 Column transformations

Column transformations are used to apply styles and formats.

You get an input value, and return either a string or a Future.

Example date+colour transformation on column:

 $col->apply_transformation(sub {
  my $v = shift;
  Future->wrap(
   String::Tagged->new(strftime '%Y-%m-%d', $v)
   ->apply_tag(0, 4, b => 1)
   ->apply_tag(5, 1, fg => 8)
   ->apply_tag(6, 2, fg => 4)
   ->apply_tag(9, 1, fg => 8)
  );
 });

=head3 Cell transformations

Cell transformations are for cases where you need fine control over individual components. They operate similarly to column transformations,
taking the input value and returning either a string or a Future.

Typical example would be a spreadsheet:

 $cell->apply_transformation(sub {
  my $v = shift;
  return $v unless blessed $v;
  return eval $v if $v->is_formula;
  return $v->to_string if $v->is_formatted;
  return "$v"
 });

=head3 View transformations

This happen every time the row is rendered. They provide the ability to do view-specific modification,
such as replacing long strings with an elided version ("Some lengthy messa...")

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new

Instantiate. Will attempt to take focus.

Takes the following named parameters:

=over 4

=item * on_activate - coderef to call when the user hits the Enter key,
will be passed the highlighted row or selection when in C<multi_select> mode,
see L</on_activate> for more details.

=item * multi_select - when set, the widget will allow selection of multiple
rows (typically by pressing Space to toggle a given row)

=item * adapter - an L<Adapter::Async::OrderedList::Array> instance

=item * data - alternative to passing an adapter, if you want to wrap an existing
array without creating an L<Adapter::Async::OrderedList> subclass yourself

=back

Returns a new instance.

=head2 bus

Bus for event handling. Normally an L<Adapter::Async::Bus> instance
shared by the adapter.

=head1 METHODS - Table content

=head2 clear

Clear all data in the table.

=head2 expose_row

Expose the given row (provided as an index into the underlying storage).

 $tbl->expose_row(14);

=head2 add_column

Add a new column. Takes the following named parameters:

=over 4

=item * width - (optional) number of columns

=item * type - (optional) data type, currently only supports 'text' (the default)

=item * align - (optional) align left, center or right

=item * transform - (optional) list of transformations to apply

=item * visible - (optional) true if this column should be shown

=back

Returns $self.

=head2 selected_rows

Returns the selected row, or multiple rows as a list if multi_select is enabled.
If multi_select is enabled it does not return the row currently highlighted (unless that row is also selected).

=head1 METHODS - Callbacks

=head2 on_activate

Accessor for the activation callback - if called without parameters,
will return the current coderef (if any), otherwise, will set the new
callback.

This callback will be triggered via L</key_activate>:

 $code->($row_index, $row_data_as_arrayref)

If multiselect is enabled, the callback will have the following:

 $code->(
   [$highlight_row_index, @selected_row_indices],
   $highlight_row_data_as_arrayref,
   @selected_rows_as_arrayrefs
 )

(the selected row data + index list could be empty here)

=head2 multi_select

Accessor for multi_select mode - when set, this allows multiple rows
to be selected.

=head1 METHODS - Other

=head2 lines

Number of lines to request.

=head2 cols

Number of columns to request.

=head2 vscroll

True if there's a vertical scrollbar (currently there is no way to
disable this scrollbar).

=head2 hscroll

True if there's a horizontal scrollbar. There isn't one, this always
returns false.

=head2 row_offset

Current row offset (vertical scroll position).

=head2 header_rect

Returns the L<Tickit::Rect> representing the header area.

=head2 body_rect

Returns the L<Tickit::Rect> representing the body area.

=head2 scrollbar_rect

Returns the L<Tickit::Rect> representing the scroll bar.

	$self
}

=head2 show_header

=head1 METHODS - Key bindings

=head2 key_previous_row

Go to the previous row.

=head2 key_next_row

Move to the next row.

=head2 key_first_row

Move to the first row.

=head2 key_next_page

Go down a page.

=head2 key_next_column

Move to the next column.

=head2 key_previous_column

Move to the previous column.

=head2 key_first_column

Move to the first column.

=head2 key_last_column

Move to the last column.

=head2 key_activate

Call the C< on_activate > coderef with either the highlighted item, or the selected

 $on_activate->([ row indices ], [ items... ])

The items will be as returned by the storage adapter, and will not have any of the
data transformations applied.

=head2 key_select_toggle

Toggle selected row.

=head1 METHODS - Filtering

Very broken. Ignore these for now. Sorry.

=head2 row_visibility

Sets the visibility of the given row (by index).

Example:

 # Make row 5 hidden
 $tbl->row_visibility(5, 0)
 # Show row 0
 $tbl->row_visibility(0, 1)

=head2 filter

This will use the given coderef to set the visibility of each row in the table.
The coderef will be called once for each row, and should return true for rows
which should be visible, false for rows to be hidden.

The coderef currently takes a single parameter: an arrayref representing the
columns of the row to be processed.

 # Hide all rows where the second column contains the text 'OK'
 $tbl->filter(sub { shift->[1] ne 'OK' });

Note that this does not affect row selection: if the multiselect flag is enabled,
it is possible to filter out rows that are selected. This behaviour is by design
(the idea was to allow union select via different filter criteria), call the
L</unselect_hidden_rows> method after filtering if you want to avoid this.

Also note that this is a one-shot operation. If you add or change data, you'll
need to reapply the filter operation manually.

=head2 unselect_hidden_rows

Helper method to mark any hidden rows as unselected.
Call this after L</filter> if you want to avoid confusing
users with invisible selected rows.

=head1 TODO

Current list of pending features:

=over 4

=item * Column and cell highlighting modes

=item * Proper widget-in-cell support

=item * Better header support (more than one row, embedded widgets)

=item * More efficient redraw when showing/hiding header (scroll body and redraw just the header lines)

=back

=head1 SEE ALSO

Other tables and table-like things:

=over 4

=item * L<Tickit::Widget::Table::Paged> - earlier version of this module without adapter support

=item * L<Text::ANSITable> - not part of L<Tickit> but has some impressive styling capabilities.

=item * L<Term::TablePrint> - again, not part of L<Tickit> but provides an interactive table
via direct terminal access.

=back

And these are probably important background reading for formatting and data source support:

=over 4

=item * L<String::Tagged> - supported for applying custom formatting (specifically, pen attributes)

=item * L<Adapter::Async> - API for dealing with abstract data sources

=item * L<Adapter::Async::OrderedList> - subclass of the above for our tabular layout API

=back
