2004/02/12 19:00 (-0500) muppetman

	* Makefile.PL: add_headers is a noop in ExtUtils::Depends >= 0.2,
	and doesn't do anything useful that install doesn't do in < 0.2,
	so take it out.  this avoids some noise on stderr as well.

	trick. use Glib::MakeHelper.

	better.

	them in the upstream dist makes things difficult for the packagers

2003/10/09 23:52 muppetman

	stuff to use GPerlCallbacks.  (i'm committing because chas has no

	requirements using pkg-config's interface, make use of it.

2003/09/16 23:50 rwmcfa1

	* Makefile.PL, perl-*spec.in: somewhat automated versioning system 
	implemented for depenancy modules

2003/07/05 07:13 rwmcfa1

	gchar_own

	after copying from Gtk2-Perl

2003/05/27 20:36 rwmcfa1

	* GladeXML.xs: a pass at the custom_handler stuff, very close to what's

	lack of signal_connect_object (which is irrelivent with gtk2-perl)
	should be ok. this comments on the fact and cleans it up slightly.
