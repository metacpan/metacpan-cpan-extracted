NAME
    RCU - Remote Control Unit Interface

SYNOPSIS
       use RCU;

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides a generic interface to remote control units (only
    receivers at the moment, as I cannot test more). It only provides an
    abstract management interface, other modules are required for the
    hardware access (RCU::Irman and RCU::Lirc are included, however).

  GETTING STARTED
    Please read RCU::Receipts to get some idea on how to proceed after you
    installed the module (testing & standard techniques).

THE RCU CLASS
    The RCU class provides a general interface to anything you might want to
    do to, it represents your application.

    $rcu = new RCU "interface-spec"
        Creates a new RCU application. "interface" must be an interface
        specification similar to DBI's DSN:

         RCU:ifname:arg:arg...

        Examples: low-level interface (without "RCU::" prefix) or an
        arrayref containing name and constructor arguments. If the interface
        name has a "::" prefix it will be used as-is (without that prefix,
        of course).

        For a much better interface, see RCU::Event.

    $rcu->interface
        Return the RCU::Interface object used by this RCU object.

    ($keycode, $repeat) = $rcu->get
    ($keycode, $repeat) = $rcu->poll
        Simplified interface to the RCU (See also RCU::Event), return a
        cooked keycode and a repeat count (initial keypress = 0, increasing
        while the key is pressed). If "get" is called in scalar context it
        only returns unrepeated keycodes.

        This interface is problematic: no key-up events are generated, and
        the repeat events occur pseudo-randomly and have no time relation
        between each other, so better use the event-based interface provided
        by RCU::Event.

THE RCU::Key CLASS
    This class collects information about rcu keys.

THE RCU::Interface CLASS
    "RCU::Interface" provides the base class for all rcu interfaces, it is
    rarely used directly.

    fd  Return a unix filehandle that can be polled, or -1 if this is not
        possible.

    ($time, $raw, $cooked) = $if->get
    ($time, $raw, $cooked) = $if->poll
        Wait until a RCU event happens and return it. If the device can
        translate raw keys events (e.g. hex key codes) into meaningful names
        ("cooked" keys) it will return the cooked name as second value,
        otherwise both return values are identical.

        "get" always returns an event, waiting if neccessary, while "poll"
        only checks for an event: If one is pending it is returned,
        otherwise "poll" returns nothing.
