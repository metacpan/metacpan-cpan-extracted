Revision history for Perl extension XML::Encoding.

2.09 30 May 2014
        - Uploaded source code to GitHub and included repository URLs in
          metadata.
        - Included META.json file in addition to META.yml.
        - Set minimum required ExtUtils::MakeMaker version to 6.64 to ensure
          that all parameters used are supported, to save jumping through hoops
          to support earlier versions.  (This should not be a problem since
          ExtUtils::MakeMaker 6.64 is easily installed into Perl 5.8.1 and
          above, that being the whole point of the new choice of minimum
          supported Perl version.)
        - Set minimum required Perl version to 5.8.1.  This is in line with the
          minimum requirement of the "Perl Toolchain".
2.08 20 Sep 2010
        - Changed test script to use Test::More, renamed it to test.t and moved
          it into the t/ folder. (Fixes [cpan #61369].)
        - Moved the perl module into the lib/ folder.
2.07 29 Jan 2009
        - Minor correction to POD from Daniel Leidert <daniel.leidert@wgdd.de>.
2.06 20 Jan 2009
        - Fixed make_encmap to avoid spurious output when there is an error with
          the input file. (Fixes [cpan #41854].)
2.05 11 Sep 2008
        - Changed the shebang line in the two scripts to be less specific. Thanks
          to Daniel Leidert <daniel.leidert@wgdd.de> for the suggestion.
2.04 06 Sep 2008
        - Incorporated a patch from Daniel Leidert <daniel.leidert@wgdd.de> which
          updates the maps iso-8859-2.xml to iso-8859-9.xml and adds the maps
          iso-8859-1.xml, iso-8859-10.xml, iso-8859-11.xml, iso-8859-13.xml to
          iso-8859-16.xml and windows-1251.xml.
        - Updated the map windows-1250.xml and added the maps windows-1252.xml to
          windows-1258.xml using data from ftp://ftp.unicode.org/Public/MAPPINGS.
2.03 08 Jul 2008
        - Improved POD formatting of compile_encoding and make_encmap manual pages,
          courtesy of a patch from Daniel Leidert <daniel.leidert@wgdd.de>.
2.02 29 Jun 2008
        - Added manual pages supplied by Daniel Leidert <daniel.leidert@wgdd.de>
          for compile_encoding and make_encmap.
2.01 24 Jul 2007
        - Fixed crash at end of test script when using perl-5.6.x. (The crash
          was actually due to a bug in perl that is fixed as of perl-5.8.0 at
          least, so the test script is simply modified to not tickle that bug.)
        - Clarified the copyright notices. Only the *changes* in version 2.x are
          my copyright.
2.00 18 Jul 2007
        - Fixed bin/compile_encoding to run with perl-5.9.x by using restricted
          hashes instead of pseudo-hashes (which have been removed from
          perl-5.9.x)
        - Fixed accidental variable interpolation in Encoding.pm
        - Fixed case of $ExtUtils::MakeMaker::VERSION in Makefile.PL so that
          ABSTRACT_FROM and AUTHOR get set when intended
        - Added LICENSE to Makefile.PL
1.01
        - Added PREREQ_PM to Makefile.PL
        - Added x-euc-jp-jisx0221 and x-euc-jp-unicode from
          Yoshida Masato <yoshidam@inse.co.jp> to maps
        - With the advice of MURATA Makoto <murata@apsdc.ksp.fujixerox.co.jp>,
          removed the Shift_JIS encoding and replaced it with 4 variations
          he provided. He also provided an explanatory message.
