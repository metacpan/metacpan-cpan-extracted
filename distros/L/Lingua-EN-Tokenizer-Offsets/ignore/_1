Introduction
Chemolithotrophic
nitrification
is
a
two-step
process
involving
two
groups
of
bacteria
:
ammonia-oxidizing
bacteria
(
AOB
)
oxidize
NH3
to
NO2-
and
nitrite-oxidizing
bacteria
(
NOB
)
oxidize
NO2-
to
NO3-
(
1
)
.
Nitrification
is
an
important
process
in
biogeochemical
nitrogen
cycling
and
in
controlling
effluent
toxicity
in
wastewater
treatment
.
The
physiological
activity
and
abundance
of
these
organisms
in
wastewater
processing
is
critical
in
the
design
and
operation
of
waste
treatment
systems,
particularly
since
these
organisms
display
low
growth
rate
and
high
sensitivity
to
environmental
disturbances
and
inhibitors
(
2
)
.
An
important
aspect
of
activity
relates
to
reactor
design
.
Single
sludge
wastewater
treatment
designs
accomplish
nitrification
concurrent
with
removal
of
carbonaceous
oxygen
demand
in
one
reactor
;
activated
sludge
in
these
reactors
contains
both
heterotrophs
and
nitrifiers
that
necessarily
compete
for
resources
such
as
oxygen
(
3
)
.
Single
sludge
reactors
are
a
dominant
design
in
the
United
States
(
4
)
.
Alternatively,
nitrification
can
be
accomplished
using
a
series
of
reactors,
the
first
dedicated
to
carbonaceous
oxygen
demand
removal
and
the
second
to
nitrification
.
To
date,
molecular
quantification
of
nitrifying
populations
in
activated
sludge
from
full-scale
wastewater
treatment
plants
(
WWTPs
)
has
been
performed
on
samples
obtained
from
facilities
with
high
nitrogen
loads
(
5
)
or
twostage
reators
(
6,
7
)
.
Given
that
single-sludge
nitrification
processes
may
contain
fewer
nitrifiers
and
are
more
susceptible
to
plant
upsets,
attempts
at
quantification
of
nitrifiers
in
these
plants
is
warranted
.
In
recent
studies,
a
competitive
Polymerase
Chain
Reaction
(
cPCR
)
procedure
was
developed
to
quantify
nitrifying
bacteria
by
PCR
amplification
of
ammonia
monooxygenase
(
amoA
)
and
Nitrospira
spp
.
16S
rRNA
genes
(
16S
rDNA
)
,
respectively
(
8,
9
)
.
The
cPCR
procedure
is
a
well
established
quantitative
method
that
has
been
used
to
enumerate
both
culturable
and
nonculturable
organisms,
including
nitrifying
bacteria
(
10-13
)
.
This
method
relies
on
the
measurement
of
PCR
products
at
the
endpoint,
after
gel
electrophoresis,
and
it
has
a
log-linear
detection
range
of
only
2
to
3
orders
of
magnitude
(
14,
15
)
.
The
cPCR
technique
is
robust
due
to
the
presence
of
a
stringent
internal
control
.
However,
cPCR
is
difficult
to
use
in
routine
process
monitoring
of
populations
in
wastewater
treatment
processes
because
it
is
labor-
and
cost-intensive
with
low
throughput
.
In
the
current
study,
real-time
PCR
was
investigated
for
applications
in
monitoring
nitrifying
populations
in
wastewater
treatment
because
it
combines
high
throughput
with
high
analytical
sensitivity
and
precision,
offering
a
dynamic
detection
range
of
6
orders
of
magnitude
or
more
(
15,
16
)
.
Although
real-time
PCR
has
been
widely
applied
in
medical
research,
its
application
to
environmental
research
has
been
slower
(
17-21
)
.
In
real-time
PCR,
amplicons
are
detected
by
measurement
of
a
fluorescence
signal
without
post-PCR
sample
processing
such
as
gel
electrophoresis
(
Figure
1
)
.
Several
different
fluorescent
probes
can
be
used
in
real-time
PCR
including
TaqMan
(
22
)
or
Molecular
Beacon
(
23,
24
)
.
A
TaqMan
probe
is
a
linear
oligonucleotide
complementary
to
a
target
nucleic
acid
sequence,
with
a
fluorophore
attached
to
the
5
′
end
and
a
quencher
to
the
3
′
end
(
22
)
(
Figure
1
)
.
The
TaqMan
probe
is
cleaved
by
the
5
′
exonuclease
activity
of
Taq
DNA
polymerase
as
the
primer
is
extended,
resulting
in
the
separation
of
the
reporter
dye
from
quencher
dye
and
an
increase
in
fluorescence
signal
emitted
by
the
reporter
.
In
each
cycle,
additional
reporter
dye
molecules
are
cleaved,
resulting
in
an
increase
in
fluorescence
intensity
proportional
to
the
amount
of
amplicon
produced
(

)
.

and
the
stem
results
from
the
annealing
of
artificially
designed
arm
sequences
(
23,

)
.
A

dye
(

)
and
a

(

)
are
attached
to
the
arm
sequences
.
Step
:
(
1
)
Denaturation
at
95
°
C
results
in
the
separation
of
the
template
DNA
and
separation
of
the
stem
on
the
molecular
beacon
probe,
separating
the
quencher
from
the
dye
allowing
fluorescence
.
(
2
)
Annealing
at
60
°
C
allows
the
probe
to
hybridize
to
the
template
resulting
in
fluorescence
.
Alternatively,
if
the
probe
does
not
hybridize
with
the
template
the
stem-and-loop
structure
is
reformed
and
fluorescence
is
quenched
.
The
relative
fluorescence
is
measured
at
the
beginning
of
this
step
(
eye
)
and
is
proportional
to
the
number
of
target
sequences
.
(

)
Extension
and
synthesis
of
DNA
at
72
°
C
results
in
dissociation
of
the
probe
from
the
target
and
fluorescence
is
quenched
.
Steps
1-3
are
repeated
45
to
50
times
.
The
final
output
for
both
assays
shows
relative
fluorescence
as
a
function
of
cycle
number
.

curves
for
template
concentrations
between
107
and
10
copies
per

.
The
threshold
is
calculated
as
10
times
the
standard
deviation
of
the
background
fluorescence
(

)
.
The
point
where
the
fluorescence
signal

Molecular
Beacon
probe
has
a
stem
and
loop
structure,
with
the
loop
section
of
the
probe
complementary
to
the
target
and
the
stem
formed
by
the
annealing
of
an
artificially
designed
arm
sequence
(
24
)
.
A
fluorescent
dye
and
a
quencher
are
attached
to
both
ends
of
the
molecule
(
Figure
1
)
.
When
free
in
solution
the
Molecular
Beacon
adopts
a
hairpin
structure,
which
results
in
fluorophore
quenching
.
In
the
presence
of
a
complementary
target,
the
hairpin
structure
unfolds
and
the
separation
of
the
fluorophore
and
the
quencher
leads
to
emission
of
fluorescence
.
Using
either
a
TaqMan
or
a
Molecular
Beacon
probe
the
threshold
cycle
of
a
sample
is
inversely
proportional
to
the
logarithm
of
the
amount
of
template
DNA
initially
added
to
the
PCR
reaction
for
both
types
of
probe
(
22-24
)
.
Although
the
design,
chemistry
and
portion
of
the
PCR
cycle
in
which
fluorescence
is
detected
differ
for
these
two
probes,
similar
results
should
be
obtained
in
the
enumeration
of
molecules
.
The
primary
objectives
of
the
current
study
were
to
develop
methods
and
to
quantify
ammonia-oxidizing
bacteria
and
nitrite-oxidizing
bacteria
(
Nitrospira
)

assays
by
comparison
with
previous
data
in
copies

Gene
copies
were
initially
calculated
by

.
To
reduce

In

were
obtained
for
the
Nitrospira

In
the
no

control
reactions
using
the
16S
rDNA
assay
a
CT
value
of
29.7
(
0.43

obtained
.
Conversion
of
the
CT
value
to
copies

indicated
that
there
were
3.8

bacterial
16S

in
the
control
reaction

This
background
value
may
result
from
bacterial
DNA
contamination
of
the
Taq
enzyme
or
other
reagents
in
the
PCR
mix
.
The
MLSS
sample
containing
greater
than
5
pg
DNA
per
PCR
assay
was
20-fold
higher
than
the
detection
limit
(

the
effect
of
background
contamination
on
the
calculated
value
would
be
less
than
5
%
in
the
most
dilute
samples
.
Conversion
of
the
CT

indicated
that
the

The

bacteria,
AOB,

oligotropha-like
AOB
and
Nitrospira
cells
per
liter
MLSS
were
calculated
from
copies
per
liter
using
several
assumptions
regarding
gene
copies
per
cell
(
Table
3,
Figure
5
)
.
First,
the
average
16S
rDNA
copies
per
genome
in
bacterial
cells
were
assumed
to
be
3.6
copies
based
on
the
average
16S
rDNA
copies
found
in
cultured
bacteria
(

)
.
Second,
one
cell
of
N.
oligotropha
was
assumed
to
contain
2
copies
amoA
based
on
the
copies
reported
for
N.
europaea
(
31
)
.
Third,
both
AOB
and
Nitrospira
were
assumed
to
contain
1
copy
16S
rDNA
per
cell
based
on
copies
16S
rDNA
found
in
Nitrobacter
and
the
AOB
Nitrosomonas
and
Nitrosospira
(

)
.
In
the

total
bacteria
ranged

Nitrospira

ranged
from
1.7

to
1.2

cells
per

MLSS
and
were
relatively
constant
through
the
year
(

The
number

bacteria
as
determined
using
the
AOB

not
as
constant
with
a
drop
in
AOB
in
the
August,

October
samples
(

.
Although
the

were
about

the
values

Discussion
Real-time
PCR
using
a
fluorescent
internal
probe
combines
high
throughput
with
high
analytical
sensitivity
for
the
detection
of
specific
genes
present
in
low
concentrations
in
complex
and
variable
DNA
mixtures,
such
as
those
extracted
from
environmental
samples
.
The
log-linear
detection
range
using
standards
in
the
real-time
PCR
assays
was
very
broad,
with
up
to
6
orders
of
magnitude
and
detection
limits
of
10
to
60
copies
for
the
Nitrospira
16S
rDNA,
16S
AOB
rDNA,
and
N.
oligotropha
amoA
assays
.
These
values
were
comparable
to
other
real-time
PCR
assays
(
15-20
)
.
The
bacterial
16S
rDNA
assay
showed
a
log-linear
detection
range
across
4
orders
of
magnitude
.
The
higher
detection
limit
(
4.5
×
103
copies
per
PCR
)
in
the
bacterial
assay
was
comparable
to
the
detection
limit
for
other
bacterial
real-time
PCR
assays
(
21,
37
)
.
These
high
detection
limits
in
bacteria
real-time
PCR
assays
are
generally
attributed
to
DNA
contamination
of
the
Taq
DNA
polymerase
enzyme
or
other
sources
such
as
water
and
plasticware
(
37
)
.
The
high
detection
limit
in
the
bacterial
real-time
PCR
assay
did
not
affect
the
use
of
this
assay
in
DNA
extracted
from
MLSS
because
these
samples
contained
approximately
108
bacterial
16S
rDNA
copies
per
µg
of
DNA
.

The
bacterial
16S
rDNA
real-time
PCR
assay
was
designed
to
be
a
broad-based
assay
for
the
estimation
of
total
bacterial
biomass
in
the
MLSS
.
This
assay
may
also
serve
as
an
internal
standard,
since
bacterial
16S
rDNA
in
the
MLSS
remained
relatively
constant
.
Although
the
PCR
primers
and
probes
used
in
this
study
have
zero
base
pair
mismatches
with
more
than
9000
bacterial
16S
rDNA
sequences
found
in
GenBank,
the
number
of
bacterial
cells
calculated
needs
to
be
considered
an
estimate
because
some
bacterial
strains
/
and
or
species
may
not
hybridize
to
the
primers
or
probes
and
thus
may
not
be
detected
.
The
cell
/
L
values
obtained
using
the
real-time
PCR
assay
were
10-fold
less
than
those
obtained
by
dot-blots
using
a
single
probe
.
This
may
result
from
the
reduction
of
background
due
to
the
combined
specificity
levels
of
the
primers
and
probe
used
for
the
16S
rDNA
assay
.
In
addition
the
probe
1392r
used
for
the
dot-blot
hybridizations
(
9
)
is
a
universal
probe
that
hybridizes
to
eukaryotic
DNA
found
in
the
MLSS
and
measures
total
microbial
population
including
both
eukaryotic
and
bacterial
cells
.
The
bacterial
real-time
PCR
assay
used
in
this
study
has
not
been
compared
to
other
bacterial
16S
rDNA
real-time
PCR
assays
(
21,
37,
38
)
.
Application
of
PCR
assays
to
environmental
samples
is
complicated
by
several
factors
such
as
low
concentration
of
targets
and
the
possible
presence
of
PCR
inhibitors
.
The
inhibitory
effects
of
complex
genomic
DNA
at
concentrations
of
10
to
50
ng
/
ul
and
other
PCR
inhibitors
can
be
minimized
by
dilution
of
the
DNA
extracts
.
However,
over-dilution
may
result
in
low
total
DNA
and
target
concentrations
resulting
in
high
variability
and
potential
over-
or
under-estimation
of
the
target
.
In
this
study,
the
acceptable
DNA
per
PCR
range
varied
between
the
assays
with
the
bacterial
16S
rDNA
and
Nitrospira
16S
rDNA
assays
producing
similar
results
over
a
broad
DNA
concentration
range
(
1000
to
2500-fold
)
.
In
contrast,
the
N.
oligotropha-like
amoA
and
AOB
16S
rDNA
assay
produced
consistent
results
over
a
narrow
DNA
concentration
range
(
5
to
10-fold
)
.
These
results
suggest
that
in
DNA
extracts
from
environmental
samples
real-time
PCR
assays
may
need
to
be
performed
using
several
dilutions
.
Other
factors
that
may
affect
real-time
PCR
assays
are
a
loss
in
fluorescence
signal
due
to
a
large
excess
of
complex
DNA
or
an
overestimation
of
target
DNA
due
to
limited
probe
specificity
(
15
)
.
The
design
of
specific
PCR
assays
for
Nitrospira
16S
rDNA
was
straightforward
because
regions
of
the
Nitrospira
16S
rDNA
are
well
conserved
between
Nitrospira
species
and
distinct
from
nearest
phylogenetic
groups
(
39,
40
)
.
The
primers
used
for
the
Nitrospira
real-time
PCR
assays
in
this
study
were
previously
demonstrated
to
be
specific
for
Nitrospira
sp.
in
the
cPCR
assay
(
9
)
.
The
Molecular
Beacon
and
TaqMan
probes
were
designed
using
the
same
target
sequence
used
in
the
cPCR
assay
.
The
differences
in
values
obtained
previously
in
individual
MLSS
samples
using
cPCR
and
more
recently
using
the
Molecular
Beacon
and
TaqMan
real-time
PCR
assays
were
statistically
insignificant
.
This
suggests
that
quantitative
PCR
methods
are
robust
and
that
real-time
PCR
assays
can
be
adapted
from
cPCR
assays
.

PCR
using
the
TaqMan
probes
have
also
been
reported
for
the
quantification
of
Mycobacterium
tuberculosis
DNA
in
sputum
(
41
)
.
In
contrast
to
the
Nitrospira
assay,
designing
a
real-time
PCR
assay
to
detect
AOB
is
more
complicated
for
two
reasons
.
First,
wastewater
treatment
plants
may
contain
multiple
species
of
AOB
(
28
)
.
Second,
most
AOB
are
phylogenetically
closely
related
to
other
activated
sludge
bacteria
within
the
beta-subdivision
class
of
Proteobacteria
.
Both
the
16S
rDNA
and
amoA
gene
provide
well-studied
genetic
markers
for
the
characterization
of
AOB
(
28
)
.
DNA
probes
and
primers
targeting
AOB
16S
rDNA
have
been
used
to
detect
essentially
all
known
beta-subdivision
AOB
species
(
2,
5-7,
11,
12,
28
)
.
The
16S
rDNA
assay
described
by
Hermansson
and
Lindgren
(
20
)
is
broad
based
and
can
quantify
a
range
of
AOB
species
including
N.
oligotropha,
the
presumptive
AOB
species
at
this
WWTP
.
One
potential
problem
with
probes
and
primers
designed
to
target
AOB
16S
rDNA
is
that
they
may
hybridize
with
closely
related
non-AOB
species
resulting
in
false
positives
.
Indeed,
BLAST
analysis
of
the
primers
and
probe
used
in
the
AOB
16S
rDNA
assay
indicated
that
one
of
the
degenerate
permutations
of
each
of
the
RT1r
and
TMP1
sequences
had
zero
mismatches
to
Ralstonia
eutropha,
a
non-AOB
species
.
However,
in
realtime
PCR
assays,
3
oligonucleotides
(
2
primers
and
1
probe
)
must
bind
for
efficient
amplification
and
detection,
so
the
effect
of
nonspecific
hybridization
by
one
primer
or
probe
is
reduced
.
The
amoA
gene
can
be
used
as
an
alternative
phylogenetic
marker
or
target
molecule
for
the
detection
of
AOB
(
28
)
.
The
amoA
gene
is
found
only
in
AOB
and
thus
serves
as
a
more
specific
marker
than
the
16S
rDNA
.
However,
the
amoA
gene
has
higher
sequence
variability
between
AOB
than
the
16S
rDNA,
thus
making
it
more
difficult
to
design
a
single
assay
to
detect
all
ammonia
oxidizing
bacteria
.
In
this
study,
the
real-time
PCR
assay
was
designed
to
detect
N.
oligotrophalike
bacteria
because
it
was
the
only
AOB
previously
found
within
the
municipal
WWTP
used
in
this
study
(
9
)
.
The
primers
amoNo550D2f
and
amoNo754r
were
redesigned
from
the
previously
published
cPCR
primers
based
on
additional
sequence
information
obtained
from
amoA
clonal
libraries
made
to
MLSS
obtained
from
a
bioreactor
system
(
8
)
.
The
specificity
of
the
primer
pair
was
confirmed
by
additional
sequence
analysis
of
clonal
libraries
obtained
after
PCR
amplification
and
cloning
of
the
product
.
When
compared
to
the
cPCR
assay,
the
real-time
PCR
with
the
redesigned
primers
detected
about
50-fold
more
amoA
copies
in
the
municipal
MLSS
samples
.
The
specificity
of
the
N.
oligotropha-like
amoA
real-time
PCR
assay
was
confirmed
by
the
lack
of
amplification
found
in
industrial
MLSS
samples
which
lack
N.
oligotropha
but
contain
N.
nitrosa
AOB
(
9
)
.
Because
the
AOB
16S
rDNA
assay
has
the
potential
to
produce
false
positives
and
the
N.
oligotropha
amoA
assay
has
the
potential
to
produce
false
negatives,
the
use
of
the
two
assays
in
these
samples
provides
complimentary
data
for
the
detection
of
AOB
.
The
16S
rDNA
assay
and
the
amoA
assay
were
highly
correlated
and
both
assays
indicated
a
drop
in
AOB
during
August,
September,
and
October
suggesting
that
both
assays
were
useful
for
AOB
quantification
.
The
reason
for
the
drop
in
AOB
is
unclear
as
the
percent
nitrification
remained
constant
and
there
was
no
apparent
link
to
the
basin
temperature
.
The
AOB
cell
numbers
calculated
by
the
16S
rDNA
assay
were
approximately
2-fold
higher
than
the
N.
oligotropha
cell
numbers
using
the
amoA
assay
.
Although
AOB
have
not
been
cultured
from
this
plant,
these
results
suggest
that
N.
oligotropha-like
AOB
comprise
at
least
50
%
of
the
AOB
population
in
this
WWTP
.
The
percent
of
the
AOB
population
determined
using
either
the
AOB
16S
rDNA
assay
(
2.9
%
)
or
the
N.
oligotropha
amoA
assay
(
1.7
%
)
were
3-4-fold
lower
than
reported
for
an

activated
sludge
sample
obtained
from
the
second
stage
of
a
2-stage
WWTP
measured
by
fluorescence
in
situ
hybridization
(
FISH
)
(
8.4
%
)
(
6
)
.
Additionally,
the
AOB
percent
was
approximately
2-3-fold
lower
than
reported
for
a
sludge
sample
from
an
industrial
plant
connected
to
a
rendering
factory
(
7
%
)
(
7
)
.
Differences
in
the
percent
of
ammoniaoxidixing
bacteria
between
these
studies
may
reflect
the
differences
in
the
operation
and
design
of
the
WWTPs,
e.g.
single-sludge
nitrification
versus
two-stage
rectors
or
sludge
with
a
high
nitrogen
load
.
Alternatively,
the
differences
may
reflect
differences
in
the
methods,
FISH
versus
real-time
PCR
.
Interestingly,
the
percent
Nitrospira
(
8.6
%
)
calculated
in
this
study
is
consistent
with
values
obtained
by
FISH
in
the
sludge
from
an
industrial
plant
connected
to
a
rendering
factory
at
9
%
to
12
%
Nitrospira
population
(
7,
40
)
.
The
ammonia-oxidizing
activity
per
cell
per
hour
was
calculated
based
on
the
estimated
number
of
ammoniaoxidizing
cells
in
the
basin
and
the
estimated
amount
of
ammonia
oxidized
per
hour
.
The
estimated
ammoniaoxidizing
rate
of
7.7
fmol
/
hr
/
cell
based
on
AOB
16S
rDNA,
or
12.4
fmol
/
hr
/
cell
based
on
the
N.
oligotropha
amoA,
were
in
the
range
of
values
reported
using
FISH
(
2.3
(
0.4
fmol
/
hr
/
cell
)
(
6
)
,
a
cPCR
assay
(
16
to
43
fmol
/
hr
/

)
(
34
)
and
for
pure
cultures
(
4
to
23
fmol
/
hr
/
cell
)
(
42
)
.
Given
that
the
estimated
ammonia-oxidizing
rates
are
in
the
expected
range,
it
is
likely
that
the
real-time
PCR
assays
used
in
this
study
detects
one
of,
if
not,
the
major
organisms
mediating
ammonia
oxidation
in
the
WWTP
under
study
.
The
results
of
this
study
indicate
that
real-time
PCR
technology
is
a
valuable
tool
for
quantification
of
uncultivable
or
difficult
to
culture
microbes
in
environmental
samples,
offering
high
throughput,
analytical
sensitivity,
and
precision
.
The
bacterial
16S
rDNA
assay
and
the
Nitrospira
16S
rDNA
assays
described
in
the
study
and
the
previously
published
AOB
16S
rDNA
may
have
broad
utility
to
other
wastewater
treatment
plants
and
environmental
samples
.
The
N.
oligotropha
amoA
assay
will
be
more
useful
in
wastewater
systems
where
the
N.
oligotropha
is
a
known
member
of
the
AOB
population
.
The
amoA
assay
may
also
prove
useful
in
developing
mRNA
based
reverse
transcriptase
real-time
PCR
assays
to
measure
physiological
responses
of
N.
oligotropha
to
changes
in
environmental
conditions
.
