=head1 NAME

Unixish - Data transformation framework, inspired by Unix toolbox philosophy

=head1 VERSION

This document describes version 1.0.5 of Unixish (from Perl distribution Unixish), released on 2015-09-06.

=head1 SPECIFICATION VERSION

 1.0

=head1 ABSTRACT

This document specifies B<Unixish>, Perl framework for data processing
(transformation, conversion, whatever) using the tried-and-true Unix toolbox
philosophy. For the implementation, see L<Data::Unixish>.

=head1 STATUS

Early draft. The 1.0 series does not guarantee full backward compatibility
between revisions, so caveat implementor. However, major incompatibility will
bump the version to 1.1.

=head1 PHILOSOPHY

The Unix philosophy says a program should do only one thing and do it well.
Problem is solved by sewing or chaining together a sequence of small,
specialized programs. From Douglas McIlroy, the original developer of Unix
pipelines:

 This is the Unix philosophy: Write programs that do one thing and do it well.
 Write programs to work together. Write programs to handle text streams, because
 that is a universal interface.

In Unixish, programs translate to functions. Unixish is essentially a set of
guidelines and tools on how to write such functions.

The goal of the framework is to let users easily create functions that can be
used as normal Perl functions operating on arrays and streams (filehandles), as
well as functions that can become Unix command-line utilities.

=head1 GLOSSARY

L<Data::Unixish> is the Perl implementation.

B<dux> is a short notation for Data::Unixish.

=head1 GUIDELINES

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be
interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

=item * Function should accept a hash argument C<%args>

This future-proofs the function when more and more arguments are added.

=item * Arguments should be described in Rinci metadata

See L<Rinci> and L<Rinci::function> for more details.

=item * There are some standard arguments: in, out

B<in> and B<out> are analogous to standard input and output streams, explained
below.

=item * Arguments should have good defaults

=item * Input data is given in C<$args{in}>

It is a "stream", usually actually a reference to array or a tied array.
Function can iterate it as follows:

 while (my ($index, $item) = each @{ $args{in} }) {
     ...
 }

Function SHOULD NOT slurp it in memory like this, unless necessary:

 # CAUTION!
 for (@{ $args{in} }) {
     ...
 }

Remember that in Perl 5 for() is not lazy, the stream might contain very large
amount of data or is infinite.

=item * Output should be written (appended) to C<$args{out}>

It is a "stream", usually actually a reference to array or a tied array.
Function can append output as follows:

 while (my ($index, $item) = each @{ $args{in} }) {
     ...
     push @{ $args{out} }, $res;
 }

Note that assigning an array directly doesn't work the way you think:

 # DOESN'T WORK
 $args{out} = [1, 2, 3];

=item * Error messages can be logged to Log::Any

Standard format for error message will be specified in the future.

=item * When processing, undef/invalid/non-applicable value should generally be skipped (passed unchanged)

For example, the B<date> dux function accepts either an integer (assumed as Unix
timestamp) or a L<DateTime> object. Other values like undef, an empty string, or
other kinds of unsupported objects should not be processed and just passed to
the output stream unprocessed. A warning can be logged if needed.

=back

A well-written dux function can be readily transformed into a usual Unix
command-line utility.

=head1 NAMESPACE ORGANIZATION

B<Unixish> is the specification.

B<Data::Unixish> is the implementation.

Each dux function should be written in all-lowercase name, put under
B<Data::Unixish::FUNCTION_NAME> package. The function itself is put in that
package with the same name. For example the L<Data::Unixish::date> package
contains the Data::Unixish::date::date function.

A further subpackaging is allowed, for example:
B<Data::Unixish::English::count_syllables>.

L<App::dux> is a utility to access dux functions via the command-line.

=item * L<Text::Pipe> (2007-now)

Similarly inspired by Unix pipes, OO. I didn't find this project before I
started Unixish.

Some of the differences: Text::Pipe is, as the name suggests, more
text-oriented. It was created to unify text/template processing. Unixish on the
other hand focuses on functions that can accept streams/arrays.

=item * B<Perl Power Tools> (1999-now)

(Search for C<ppt> in CPAN).

Actually not quite the same thing, but the end result is roughly the same for
many text-oriented Unix utilities (like B<wc>, B<sum>, B<head>, B<tail>, etc).
