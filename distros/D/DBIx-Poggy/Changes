    * INCOMPATIBLE: handles with transactions are not released
      to the pool after commit/rollback. They behave as any other
      handle and gets released on "destruction"
    * don't listen IO when a query gets rejected by error in pg_ready
      call
    * calls to commit/rollback are not allowed (die) when there is
      an active query on the handle
    * update documentation

    * ping DB if we take 30+ seconds old handle from the pool
    * handle more exceptions and turn them into promise's rejects
    * delete release_to state var so the same handle can be takes
      in different mode
    * don't accept handles for release that have an error and are
      not pingable
    * handle server closing connection
    * ->errobj method on dbh
    * avoid memory leak in transaction release code
    * rollback not finished transactions on destruction
