1.927	2014-05-10

 [ Packaging ]
 - Bump required version of Types::Standard to 0.040.
 - Bump required version of match::simple to 0.008.

 [ Other ]
 - Rather than defining Datetime and Uri types in Web::ID::Types, use
   Types::DateTime and Types::URI from CPAN.

1.926	2013-12-10

 - Updated: Use Exporter::Tiny instead of Exporter::TypeTiny.

1.925	2013-09-03

1.924_03	2013-08-10

 [ Packaging ]
 - configure_requires File::ShareDir.

1.924_02	2013-08-09

1.924_01	2013-08-07

 [ Bug Fixes ]
 - Type::Utils no longer exports `extends` by default; request it.

 [ Packaging ]
 - Minor packaging fixes.

1.923	2013-05-21

 - Do a better job searching for OpenSSL binary; use Alien::OpenSSL if it
   can't be found.
 - Switched from MooseX::Types to Types::Standard.
 - Switched from Path::Class to Path::Tiny.
 - Switched from Sub::Exporter to Exporter::TypeTiny.
 - Switched from smartmatch to match::smart.

1.922	2012-12-15

 [ Documentation ]
 - Documented test suite.

 [ Other ]
 - Make test suite output cleaner (no openssl junk) if Capture::Tiny is
   available.
 - Updated: RDF::Trine now uses Moose, so there's no reason for Web::ID to
   continue using Any::Moose. All the old Any::Moose/Mouse stuff is now
   gone, and Web::ID now uses Moose and MooseX::Types.
 - Updated: Switched from namespace::clean to namespace::sweep.

1.921	2012-05-20

 [ Packaging ]
 - Add version number (0.06) to MouseX::Types dependency.

1.920	2012-05-10

 [ Documentation ]
 - Minor documentation changes.

 [ Packaging ]
 - Mark as non-development release.

1.910_04	2012-05-09

 - Drop dependency on Class::Load; use load_class from Plack::Util instead.
 - Use File::Temp and Path::Class in t/04webid.t - they're already
   dependencies, so might as well.

1.910_03	2012-05-09

 - Better hooks for subclassing Plack::Middleware::Auth::WebID.

1.910_02	2012-05-08

   cleaner) API.
