Building Informix Database Driver for Perl DBI on Microsoft Windows NT

There are two ways of obtaining Perl for Windows NT, the easy way and
the hard way.  The easy way uses the pre-built ActiveState version of
Perl, ActivePerl.  The hard way uses the raw Perl source code and builds
it on your machine.  We recommend using the ActiveState Perl because it
is probably the most widely used system for Windows NT and you can
purchase support for it if you wish.

Regardless of whether you build your own Perl or use the ActiveState
version, you will need MS Visual C++ on your machine, and you will need to
set the command line environment to use it (for example, by running the
batch file C:\Progra~1\DevStudio\VC\bin\vcvars32.bat on the command line;
trying to type C:\Program Files\DevStudio\VC\bin\vcvars32.bat at the
command line with the space in it does not work).

You will need a copy of PKZip (http://www.pkzip.com) or WinZip
(http://www.winzip.com) or InfoZip (http://www.cdrom.com/pub/infozip or
ftp://ftp.cdrom.com/pub/infozip) on your machine to unpack the source code
for DBD::Informix.

You will also need a version of Informix Client SDK such as 2.40.TC1
(ESQL/C 2.30.TC1) on your machine.  Your Informix environment should be
configured so that a database server is available to you.  See the main
README file for more information on the requirements.

The build of DBD::Informix is done using an MS-DOS command window.

Using ActiveState Perl
======================

1.  Get ActivePerl (APi522e.exe was current at 2000-03-01) from ActiveState
    Tool Corporation at http://www.activestate.com and install it.  Accept
    all the options install offers (adding bin to the path etc).

2.  You should use the ActiveState PPM (Perl Package Manager) to download a
    prebuilt version of DBI rather than build and install your own version.
    Run PPM, and give the command 'install DBI'.  This will install the DBI
    module.

3.  Make sure you have Informix Client SDK installed (obtained, for
    example, from the product downloads section of the Informix web site at
    http://www.informix.com).

4.  Verify that you can connect to a database with the ILogin demo.

5.  Get the source code for DBD::Informix (DBD-Informix-2015.1101.tar.gz)
    from http://www.cpan.org, unpack it into a temporary directory, and
    then run:

        perl Makefile.PL
        nmake
        nmake test
        nmake install

Build Your Own Perl
===================

Be brave!  Read everything!

1.  Get the source code for Perl 5.005_03; extract it into a directory
    somewhere, eg C:\tmp\perl5.005_03.

2.  Change directory to C:\tmp\perl5.005_03.  Read README.win32.  Print it
    and reread it.

3.  Change directory to C:\tmp\perl5.005_03\win32.  Edit the Makefile as
    instructed.  Set , and OBJECT = -DPERL_OBJECT.  I had problems building
    with USE_PERLCRT = define, which is supposed to avoid the documented
    failure in t/posix.t, despite downloading the PerlCRT library as
    documented in the Makefile.

4.  Run:

        nmake
        nmake test
        nmake install

    This completes the Perl install.  Ensure that your environment picks up
    this version of Perl.

5.  Get the source code for DBI 1.13, unpack it into a directory such as
    C:\tmp\DBI-1.13, change to that directory, and run:

        perl Makefile.PL
        nmake
        nmake test
        nmake install

6.  Get the source code for DBD::Informix 2015.1101, unpack it into a
    directory such as C:\tmp\DBD-Informix-2015.1101, change to that
    directory, and run:

        perl Makefile.PL
        nmake
        nmake test
        nmake install

PTS Bug B83831 - Using SqlFreeMem() in dbdimp.ec

This is a mildly reformatted version of the bug record for B83831
along with the NOT-DOC assertion which states that the problem is
a documentation issue rather than a bug in the product per se.

PTS BUG NUMBER 83831                            02/29/00

Product: SDK           Date:       11/04/97   Dup. Bug ID:
Type:    SW                                   Submitter:   kputnam

---- Short Description ----
RECEIVE SAP APPLICATION ERROR (DISP+WORK.EXE) WHEN STOPPING THE SAP SERVICE
WHEN USING THE SDK I-CONNECT WITH A 7.X SERVER ON THE SAME NT BOX

---- Long Description ----
I installed the following on the same NT 4.0 system:

. Informix ODS 7.20.TE1
. SDK (All products installed but only using I-connect and run-time libs)
. SAP 30F

All products are installed on the same server in the same $INFORMIXDIR

I have tried installing both the Server first and then the client and
vice-versa.

I can bring the Informix Engine up successfully and connect to the DB.  I
start the SAP service manager and connect to the server.  However, if I
attempt to run tests from a client or stop the SAP service (disp+work.exe)
the SAP application, on the NT server, displays the following error to the
screen and all current processing from the client is halted:

"The instruction at '0x0.....' referenced memory at '0x0.....'. The
memory could not be read."

The SAP service manager is a 7.x compiled binary.

The event viewer displays the following:

Unable to write to pipe, pipe is broken. Error text: The pipe is being
closed. (ErrorNo. 232)

Documentation Changes required:
1) In the section of the ESQL/C Manual that we talk about Compiler
Version Independence we need to add a new way to solve the problem:
     function SqlFreeMem()
The SqlFreeMem() function has been in the ESQL/C run-time
(I-Connect) since 7.20.TD1, its prototype and defines are in the
shipped include files also since 7.20.TD1. It has not been
documented since it was there for backward compatibility with
version 5.01.WC1 where it was documented.

2) Once the section about Compiler Version Independence is updated
it needs to be placed in the UNIX/Windows combined release notes (as
Windows specific) and stay there since this problem is so hard to
find we need to tell the customer as many times as possible.

3) Pubs needs to search the Syntax, Tutorial, and ESQL/C manuals for
"free". PD needs to check each of these to determine if the "free"
is about the free() function and what is being freed by the customer
is memory allocated by the Informix run-time. If it is then we need
to add a note explaining that on Windows platforms free() can be
used only in special circumstances and how to get it to always work.
This would mostly be for $describe into.

4) Pubs needs to search the Syntax, Tutorial, and ESQL/C manuals for
"open". PD needs to check each of these to determine if the "open"
is about the fopen() function and if the resulting file
handle/control block is passed to the Informix run-time. If it is
then we need to add a note explaining that on Windows platforms file
handle/control blocks can be used only in special circumstances and
how to get it to always work. This would mostly be for Blobs:
LOC_FILE.

While determining that the problem was caused by the SAP application
freeing Informix allocated memory with the wrong C run-time the
following Generic and Windows specific problem were discovered and
fixed:

1) Generic, The translation module that translates 7.2x calls to
Client SDK 2.x calls has to convert 7.2x format sqlda to 9.x format
sqlda. The sqld (count of sqlvar structures allocated) can be 0, a
malloc() of zero bytes was performed (which returns a pointer to a
zero byte array on Windows). The pointer was used as a sqlvar
pointer and a flag was set to indicate the sqlvar was allocated by
Informix. The problem was that this flag was a positive offset from
a pointer to a ZERO byte array. This set a flag in memory that was
not owned by that sqlvar and it corrupted a pointer in a previously
allocated cursor.
This problem was fixed by checking for sqlda->sqld of zero, if it is
zero set the sqlvar pointer (sqlda->sqlvar) to NULL.
This was the original 83831 error.

2) Windows only, Windows DLLs work differently than UNIX shared
objects. 7.2x user applications link to and load isqlt07c.dll. The
current I-Connect run-time is named isqlt09a.dll (name changed since
the interface changed). A new isqlt07c.dll was linked (the
"translation module") that replaced the original DLL and did nothing
more than translate the 7.2x format call to a 9.x (Client SDK 2.x)
format call. To do this it need some utility routines. For ease of
building we had duplicated these utility functions in isqlt07c.dll
and isqlt09a.dll. This caused problems since it turned out that some
of these utility functions had globals in them and were written
expecting that only one version of the global existed. This problem
was fixed by moving all utility functions into isqlt09a.dll and
exporting those functions that the translation module needed.
This problem was found in the PeopleSoft application as bug # 86733
and 87146.

3) Windows only, while the translation module was passing on the
user's exported C run-time routines to isqlt09a.dll (the Client SDK
2.x I-Connect run-time) it was not using these exported routines
itself, therefore, any memory that it malloced might be from the
wrong C run-time.
This problem was found in the PeopleSoft application as bug # 86733
and 87146.

4) Generic, sqli_prep in sqli\iqdynam.c was not testing the return
code from _iqprepare, if _iqprepare detects an error it removes the
cursor, sqli_prep was returning the address of the freed cursor,
should have returned NULL.
This problem was found in the PeopleSoft application as bug # 86733
and 87146.
