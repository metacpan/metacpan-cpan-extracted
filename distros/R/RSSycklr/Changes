        - General lack of review and checking what I may or may not

        - Updated error on feed parse failure to include URI.

0.09    20090224
        - Arrrrrrg. Mac case insensitivity got me again. Makefile now
          lists Getopt::Long, not GetOpt::Long as a requirment.
        - Couple spelling errors in Pod fixed and that's it.

0.08    20081114
        - Put a default of "" into lede to prevent errors when it's
          not correctly formed.
        - Redid alarm handling a little to account for latent failures
          in XML parsing.

0.07    20080809
        - Qualified namespace with YAML::Dump call.
        - Put in a BUILD so things like Catalyst::Model::Adaptor can
          put configs into new() calls.

0.06    20080808
        - Fixed CSS typo in Pod.
        - Put in Hash::Merge::Simple for config. Made the ellipsis and
          read_more options work. Docs showed them working but they
          did not befeore.
        - Put a little Encode stuff in though frankly I'm not sure
          it's in the right place.

0.05    20080805
        - Strip leading and trailing <br/>s when they are in the keep_tags.

        - Fixed broken command line snippet to see keep_tags.
        - Happy 4 to the VI.

0.03    20080804
        - Updated half-done 0.02 entry date below. Sigh.
        - Fixed synopsis.t output a little.
        - Put timeout on XML::Feed->parse() requests.
        - Updated docs a bit and though load_config will still handle
          a Perl structure, it's not in the doc now and won't do it
          much longer.
        - Considering name change to App::RSSycklr... Not sure.

0.02    20080803
        - Improved Pod for 'rssycklr.' Didn't mean to ship it with
          such bad docs.

0.01    20080803
        - Holy cats is Mouse/Moose hot. This is an adaptation of a
          script I've been using. It's the kind of thing that normally
          seems wrong for a module but Mouse made it natural. Really
          nice. See the docs for todo and such.
