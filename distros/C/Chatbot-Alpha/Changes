Revision history for Perl extension Chatbot::Alpha.

2.05  Fri Jan 23 11:24:00 2009
	- This module is *officially* obsolete, and this is just a revision
		release so that the documentation urges users use RiveScript
		instead.

2.04  Mon Dec 19 15:42:00 2005
	- Fixed up some Perl warnings within the code.
	- Renamed the example script to 'example.pl' to not confuse Makefile.

2.03  Sat Dec 17 12:17:00 2005
	- Added ~REGEXP command.
	- Added {random} tag.
	- Added more information about #CODE on manpage.
	- Updated Chatbot::Alpha::Syntax to support the new ~REGEXP command.
	- Applied a patch to Syntax.pm to hopefully make automatic installation
		run more smoothly.

2.02  Thu Oct 27 10:57:30 2005
	- Mostly bug fixes in this release:
	- Added 'verify' argument to the new() constructor. If 1 (default),
		Chatbot::Alpha::Syntax is run on all files loaded. Set to 0 to avoid
		syntax checking (not recommended).
	- Fixed regexp bug with {formal}, {sentence}, {uppercase}, and {lowercase}.
		They should now function correctly even if their values have odd characters
		in them that would've previously screwed up the regexp parser.
	- Chatbot::Alpha::Syntax updated. See its manpage for details.
	- Rearranged a bit of the code so that <input> and <reply> would process
		before string tags.

2.01  Thu Oct 13 15:23:00 2005
	- Added string tags {formal}, {sentence}, {uppercase}, {lowercase}
	- Added tags <input> and <reply> and alias <star>.
	- Fixed conditionals bug (conditionals wouldn't increment correctly so
		only the last condition remained in memory. Now multiple conditions
		can be used for one trigger... i.e. comparing gender to male/female
		in two different conditions).

2.00  Thu Oct  6 18:53:00 2005
	- Added some AIML emulation:
		- In-reply redirections (like <srai>):
			+ * or something
			- Or something. {@<star1>}
	- "That" kind of support.
		+ i hate you
		- You're really mean... =(

		+ sorry
		% youre really mean
		- Don't worry--it's okay. :-)
	- Renamed all methods to be alternatingCaps instead of with underscores.
	- Chatbot::Alpha::Syntax supports the newly-added commands.
	- Fixed conditionals, should work more efficiently now:
		- Format changed to *VARIABLE=VALUE::HAPPENS
		- Does numeric == for numbers, or eq for strings... = better matching.

1.71  Sat Oct  1 14:01:00 2005
	- Sorting method reprogrammed for more efficient sorting.

1.70  Wed Aug 17 13:47:35 2005
        - Chatbot::Alpha::Syntax added.
        - ^ command added.
        - Module keeps filenames and line numbers internally, so on internal
                errors such as 'Deep Recursion' and 'Infinite Loop' it can point you
                to the source of the problem.
        - $alpha->search() method added.

1.61  Sat Aug  6 14:43:00 2005
        - Completed Chatbot::Alpha::Sort module.

1.40  Wed May  4 14:54:00 2005
	- Fixed major bug: * being converted to (.*?) wasn't a global replace, so
		thus far reply triggers could only contain a single *.

1.30  Tue Feb 15 16:12:00 2004
	- Added capability for topics.

1.10  Thu Dec 23 14:20:23 2004
	- Added the "#" command.
	- Fixed bugs in reply matching.

1.00  Wed Sep  6 16:22:40 2004
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.23 with options
		-X -n Chatbot::Alpha
