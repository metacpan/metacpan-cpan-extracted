0.06      2017-01-12 10:08:20-05:00 America/New_York (TRIAL RELEASE)

  [BUILD FIX]

    * Diagnosis of build failure fixed by 0.05 was only partially correct.
      "use strict" _is_ propagated for Perl >= 5.10, but the error
      message changed between Perl 5.20 && 5.22.

0.05      2017-01-12 10:08:20-05:00 America/New_York (TRIAL RELEASE)

  [BUILD FIX]

    * t/lexicals.t depended upon "use strict" being propagated into
      the quoted subs environment.  This seems not to be the case in
      Perl < 5.22

0.02      2016-12-16 17:23:01-05:00 America/New_York

  [BUG FIX]

      compile context and subroutine package.

    * quote_subs can now inline syntactically incomplete code
      snippets.
