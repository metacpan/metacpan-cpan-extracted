POE::Component::Client::Halo is an add-on to the POE framework
to allow easy access to the Halo query protocol.

This is based off an early release of the Halo dedicated server 
and was reverse engineered with a sniffer, so the specification 
may change.  I will attempt to keep the latest version on CPAN 
up-to-date with the protocol changes.

--HISTORY--
This is version 0.2.  This release adds support for player_flags
and game_flags.  The documentation in this release is still 
really rough.  The sample is still the best way to get going.

This is version 0.1.  This is the first release.
