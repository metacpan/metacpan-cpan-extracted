=head1 NAME

ORDB::CPANTS - An ORM for the published CPANTS SQLite database

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  TO BE COMPLETED

=head1 DESCRIPTION

TO BE COMPLETED

=head1 METHODS

=head2 dsn

  my $string = Foo::Bar->dsn;

The C<dsn> accessor returns the dbi connection string used to connect
to the SQLite database as a string.

=head2 dbh

  my $handle = Foo::Bar->dbh;

To reliably prevent potential SQLite deadlocks resulting from multiple
connections in a single process, each ORLite package will only ever
maintain a single connection to the database.

During a transaction, this will be the same (cached) database handle.

Although in most situations you should not need a direct DBI connection
handle, the C<dbh> method provides a method for getting a direct
connection in a way that is compatible with ORLite's connection
management.

Please note that these connections should be short-lived, you should
never hold onto a connection beyond the immediate scope.

The transaction system in ORLite is specifically designed so that code
using the database should never have to know whether or not it is in a
transation.

Because of this, you should B<never> call the -E<gt>disconnect method
on the database handles yourself, as the handle may be that of a
currently running transaction.

Further, you should do your own transaction management on a handle
provided by the <dbh> method.

In cases where there are extreme needs, and you B<absolutely> have to
violate these connection handling rules, you should create your own
completely manual DBI-E<gt>connect call to the database, using the connect
string provided by the C<dsn> method.

The C<dbh> method returns a L<DBI::db> object, or throws an exception on
error.

=head2 selectall_arrayref

The C<selectall_arrayref> method is a direct wrapper around the equivalent
L<DBI> method, but applied to the appropriate locally-provided connection
or transaction.

It takes the same parameters and has the same return values and error
behaviour.

=head2 selectall_hashref

The C<selectall_hashref> method is a direct wrapper around the equivalent
L<DBI> method, but applied to the appropriate locally-provided connection
or transaction.

It takes the same parameters and has the same return values and error
behaviour.

=head2 selectcol_arrayref

The C<selectcol_arrayref> method is a direct wrapper around the equivalent
L<DBI> method, but applied to the appropriate locally-provided connection
or transaction.

It takes the same parameters and has the same return values and error
behaviour.

=head2 selectrow_array

The C<selectrow_array> method is a direct wrapper around the equivalent
L<DBI> method, but applied to the appropriate locally-provided connection
or transaction.

It takes the same parameters and has the same return values and error
behaviour.

=head2 selectrow_arrayref

The C<selectrow_arrayref> method is a direct wrapper around the equivalent
L<DBI> method, but applied to the appropriate locally-provided connection
or transaction.

It takes the same parameters and has the same return values and error
behaviour.

=head2 selectrow_hashref

The C<selectrow_hashref> method is a direct wrapper around the equivalent
L<DBI> method, but applied to the appropriate locally-provided connection
or transaction.

It takes the same parameters and has the same return values and error
behaviour.

=head2 prepare

The C<prepare> method is a direct wrapper around the equivalent
L<DBI> method, but applied to the appropriate locally-provided connection
or transaction

It takes the same parameters and has the same return values and error
behaviour.

In general though, you should try to avoid the use of your own prepared
statements if possible, although this is only a recommendation and by
no means prohibited.

=head2 pragma

  # Get the user_version for the schema
  my $version = Foo::Bar->pragma('user_version');

The C<pragma> method provides a convenient method for fetching a pragma
for a datase. See the SQLite documentation for more details.

=head1 SUPPORT

ORDB::CPANTS is based on L<ORLite> 1.18.

Documentation created by L<ORLite::Pod> 0.06.
