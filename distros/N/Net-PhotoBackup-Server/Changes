    - Minor. Convert to use Plack::Test for testing rather than running up a
      daemon and making real HTTP requests. There were multiple failures on
      http://www.cpantesters.org/author/D/DAVEWEBB.html#Net-PhotoBackup-Server for
      OSX and some Linux/BSD architectures.
      Using Plack::Test avoids any issues around forking and daemonising on
      architectures which I can't easily test.

    - Minor. Blind attempt to fix new testing failures reported by cpantesters.org for Darwin.
      See http://www.cpantesters.org/cpan/report/4971e9a0-64d3-11e5-87d5-7a83b4e1cf47 for an example.
      - Use 0.0.0.0, rather than 127.0.0.1 for testing HTTP.
      - Wait for 2 seconds for server to start.
      - Dump diagnostics for failing tests.
 
0.08 2015-09-26T08:05:46Z

    - Switch github repo from https://github.com/d5ve/p5-Net-PhotoBackup-Server
      to https://github.com/PhotoBackup/server-perl as the module is now part
      of that organisation.

    - Use Pod::Markdown::Passthrough to allow us to edit README.md manually
      independently of the module POD.
