SYNOPSIS

        use XML::Compile::WSDL11;
        use XML::Compile::SOAP11;
        use XML::Compile::Transport::SOAPHTTP;
        use XML::CompileX::Schema::Loader;
    
        my $wsdl   = XML::Compile::WSDL11->new;
        my $loader = XML::CompileX::Schema::Loader->new(
            wsdl => $wsdl,
            uris => 'http://example.com/foo.wsdl',
        );
        $loader->collect_imports;
        $wsdl->compileCalls;
        my ( $answer, $trace ) = $wsdl->call( hello => {name => 'Joe'} );

DESCRIPTION

    From the description of XML::Compile::WSDL11:

      When the [WSDL] definitions are spread over multiple files you will
      need to use addWSDL() (wsdl) or importDefinitions() (additional
      schema's) explicitly. Usually, interreferences between those files
      are broken. Often they reference over networks (you should never
      trust). So, on purpose you must explicitly load the files you need
      from local disk! (of course, it is simple to find one-liners as
      work-arounds, but I will to tell you how!)

    This module implements that work-around, recursively parsing and
    compiling a WSDL specification and any imported definitions and
    schemas. The wrapped WSDL is available as a wsdl attribute.

    You may also provide your own LWP::UserAgent (sub)class instance,
    possibly to correct on-the-fly any broken interreferences between files
    as warned above. You can also provide a caching layer, as with
    WWW::Mechanize::Cached which is a sub-class of WWW::Mechanize and
    LWP::UserAgent.

    Please see the distribution's eg directory for sample scripts that use
    this module to save schemas from a URL to the filesystem and then
    reload them again.

ATTRIBUTES

 wsdl

    An XML::Compile::WSDL11 instance. If you do not set this, a generic
    instance will be created with the XML from the URIs in uris added. If
    there are problems retrieving any files, an HTTP::Exception is thrown
    with the details.

 uris

    Required string or URI object, or a reference to an array of the same,
    that points to WSDL file(s) to compile.

 user_agent

    Optional instance of an LWP::UserAgent that will be used to get all
    WSDL and XSD content.

METHODS

 collect_imports

    Loops through all uris, adding them as WSDL documents to wsdl and then
    importing all definitions, schemas, included and imported definition
    and schema locations. You should call this before calling any of the
    compilers in XML::Compile::WSDL11 to ensure that any dependencies have
    been imported.
