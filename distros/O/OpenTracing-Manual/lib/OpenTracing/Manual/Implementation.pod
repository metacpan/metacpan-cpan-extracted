OpenTracing::Manual::Implementation - For Tracing Service Implementations



=head1 DESCRIPTION



This part of the L<OpenTracing::Manual> will describe how communication with the
backend is established through some sort of I<Agent>. This manual also provides
information on how to C<extract_context> or C<inject_context> and carriers.

=head1 INTRODUCTION



OpenTracing merely describes the API, see the L<OpenTracing::Interface>
documentation. It only requires that any implementation has a minimal set of
methods that have a signature, or defined argument list. It is a deliberate
choice to have the specification as POD and leaving the implementation to the
Service Provider. The OpenTracing SDK for Perl however, comes with quite some
useful tools to help building your own.



=head1 THE DETAILS



=head2 Bootstrapping a Tracer Implementation

Because of directory structure, Perl best practices and more, an implementation
consists of several files, grouped under a single namespace. However, the API has
no higher level definition of what an implementation is, it only speaks of the
L<Tracer|OpenTracing::Interface::Tracer> being the I<entry point> of the API. It
only looks more natural to be able to do things like:

    use "OpenTracing::Implementation qw/YourServiceProvider/;

Which bootstraps the L<OpenTracing::GlobalTracer>.

Or be more specific in your own code:

    use aliased
        "OpenTracing::Implementation::MyServiceProvider",
        "Implementation" ;
    
    my $tracer = Implementation->bootstrap_tracer( %options );

Although the 'Implementation' could do all sorts of things with that call, it
basically is the same as:

    use aliased
        "OpenTracing::Implementation::MyServiceProvider::Tracer" ;
    
    my $tracer = Tracer->new( %options );

=head2 Writing your own Implementation and using Roles

Since a lot of the responsibilities described in the <OpenTracing::Interface>
are common across all implementations, there is a whole set of L<Moo::Role>s
files to quickly build your own classes.

    package OpenTracing::Implementation::MyServiceProvider::Scope
    
    use Moo;
    
    ...
    
    with 'OpenTracing::Role::Scope'
    
    1;

Look at L<OpenTracing::Roles> to see what each of those roles provides.



=head2 Adding Implementation Specific Information to Traces.

The L<OpenTracing::Interface::SpanContext> carries data across process
boundaries. Specifically, it has two major components:

=over

=item An implementation-dependent state to refer to the distinct span within a
trace

for example the implementing Tracer's definition of spanID and traceID

=item Any Baggage Items

These are key:value pairs that cross process-boundaries.
These may be useful to have some data available for access throughout the trace
(https://opentracing.io/docs/overview/tags-logs-baggage/#baggage-items).

=back

Depending on the purpose, it is most likely that you want to add additional
information like a I<ServiceEndpoint> to the L<SpanContext|
OpenTracing::Interface::SpanContext> as 'private' attributes. As an implementor
you do want to have a reliable way to persist that information. The
L<BaggageItems|OpenTracing::Interface::SpanContext/"METHODS"> can be altered at
application level, as they are part of the 'public' API.

    package OpenTracing::Implementation::MyServiceProvider::SpanContext
    
    use Moo;
    
    with 'OpenTracing::Role::SpanContext'
    
    has service_endpoint => (
        is      => 'ro',
        default => { 'index.cgi' },
        isa     =>  Str,
    );
    
    1;

As implementor, it's your own responsibility to send that information back to
the service provider.



=head2 Sending Span Information to a Service Provider Backend

How information is being send back to a service provider backend is beyond the
scope of this manual. There are different scenarios to do so. Some may want to
collect a larger number of spans and send those straight to the backend. Others
may have a locally installed agent that will gather spans coming from multiple
threads and send them as a batch to the backend.

Either way, as a implementor, you will need to add to the L<Tracer|OpenTracing::
Interface::Tracer> a I<send> method that will communicate with the outer world.

    package OpenTracing::Implementation::MyServiceProvider::Tracer
    
    use Moo;
    
    with 'OpenTracing::Role::Tracer'
    
    has your_agent => (
        is      => 'lazy',
        isa     => 'OpenTracing::Implementation::MyServiceProvider::Agent',
        handles => qw/send_the_span/,
    );
    
    1;

Then, at the time you call L<< C<finish>|OpenTracing::Interface::Span/
"finish(-<none>-|-$epoch_timestamp-)" >>,
calling such method as mentioned (C<send_the_span>) in the above example through
a call back added as a C<on_finish> attribute, would transmit the span.



=head2 Propagating Tracer Information between Services

At the boundary or edges of an application, Frameworks use the two methods
L<< C<inject_context>|OpenTracing::Interface::Tracer/
"inject_context(-OPENTRACING_CARRIER_FORMAT-=>-$carrier,-$span_context-)" >> and
L<< C<extract_context>|OpenTracing::Interface::Tracer/
"extract_context(-OPENTRACING_CARRIER_FORMAT-=>-$carrier-)" >>
(L<https://opentracing.io/docs/overview/tracers/#propagating-a-trace-with-inject-extract>).


It is required that these methods are provided in the implementation. There are
at least three OpenTracing required formats that need to be support. Only the
C<OPENTRACING_CARRIER_FORMAT_HTTP_HEADERS> is being described in the manual.

An C<inject_context> might be implemented like:

    package OpenTracing::Implementation::MyServiceProvider::Tracer
    
    our $injectors = {
        OPENTRACING_CARRIER_FORMAT_HTTP_HEADERS => sub {
            my $http_headers = shift;
            my $context = shift;
            
            return $http_headers->clone(
                X_YOUR_IMPLEMENTATION_TRACE_ID = $context->trace_id,
                ...
        },
        OPENTRACING_CARRIER_FORMAT_BINARY => sub { ... },
        OPENTRACING_CARRIER_FORMAT_TEXT_MAP => sub { ... },
    }
    
    sub inject_tracer {
        my $self = shift;
        my $carrier_format = shift;
        my $carrier;
        
        croak "unsupported carrier format [$carrier_format]"
            unless exists %$injectors{$carrier_format};
        
        my $context = $self->get_active_span->get_context;
        
        return $injectors->{$carrier_format}->($carrier, $context)
    }

Where the C<X_YOUR_IMPLEMENTATION_TRACE_ID> is fully provider dependent. The
other (micro) service you want to talk may be implemented using a complete
different technology stack or language. But since (most likely) that service
will use the same Distributed Tracing Backend, it expects the carrier to hold
the trace information in a known format.



=head2 OpenTracing Roles and Types

The entire L<API|OpenTracing::Interface> is described in POD, it also provides a
set of Roles. These roles can optionally be consumed to do all the type-checking
for parameters, options, and returned results.

It also provides L<OpenTracing::Types>. These duck-type checking types check
that a object will at least have the methods described in the API.
A C<isa> check will dictate a subclassing, which is what is deliberately avoided.



=head2 Testing your Implementation

There are a few tests available for Implementation developers. Those will check
that the implementation is at least compliant with the L<OpenTracing::Interface>
and can be found at L<Test::OpenTracing::Interface>.

    use Test::Most;
    use Test::OpenTracing::Interface::Span;
    
    use YourImplementation::Span;
    
    my $test_span = new_ok( 'YourImplementation::Span' => { %options },
        "Created a Span object"
    );
    
    interface_can_ok( $test_span,
        "... and can do all the required methods defined"
    );
    
    interface_lives_ok( $test_span,
        "... and each method accepts described parameters and options"
    );
    
    interface_dies_ok( $test_span,
        "... and will not tollerate bad input"
    );

The latter one should work, but only if your implementation does do some sort of
checking.

B<WARNING>: If you do not check for the parameters and their types, please do
check manually that the C<child_of> and C<references> options are mutual
exclusive in
L<< C<start_active_span>|OpenTracing::Interface::Tracer/
"start_active_span(-$operation_name,-%options-)" >>
and
L<< C<start_span>|OpenTracing::Interface::Tracer/
"start_span(-$operation_name,-%options-)" >>

Testing that your implementation is executing the C<inject_context> and
C<extract_context> correctly, is entirely up to you. Also, it is up to you to
check that the correct span information is being send to the tracer backend at
C<finish>.
