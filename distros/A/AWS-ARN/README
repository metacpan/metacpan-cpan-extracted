DESCRIPTION

CONSTRUCTOR

 new( $arn );

    Return a new AWS::ARN object

 new( partition => $part, service => $svc, region => $rgn, account_id =>
 $acct, resource_id => $res );

ATTRIBUTES

 partition

    The partition in which the resource is located. A partition is a group
    of AWS Regions. Each AWS account is scoped to one partition.

    The following are the supported partitions:

      * aws - AWS Regions

      * aws-cn - China Regions

      * aws-us-gov - AWS GovCloud (US) Regions

    Defaults to "aws"

 service

    The service namespace that identifies the AWS product. For example, s3
    for Amazon S3 resources.

 region

    The Region. For example, us-east-2 for US East (Ohio).

 account_id

    The ID of the AWS account that owns the resource, without the hyphens.
    For example, 123456789012.

 resource_id

    The resource identifier. This part of the ARN can be the name or ID of
    the resource or a resource path. For example, user/Bob for an IAM user
    or instance/i-1234567890abcdef0 for an EC2 instance. Some resource
    identifiers include a parent resource
    (sub-resource-type/parent-resource/sub-resource) or a qualifier such as
    a version (resource-type:resource-name:qualifier).

NOTES

      * Needs tests

      * Needs more validation
