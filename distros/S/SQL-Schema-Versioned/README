DESCRIPTION

    To use this module, you typically run the create_or_update_db_schema()
    routine at the start of your program/script, e.g.:

     use DBI;
     use SQL::Schema::Versioned qw(create_or_update_db_schema);
     my $spec = {...}; # the schema specification
     my $dbh = DBI->connect(...);
     my $res = create_or_update_db_schema(dbh=>$dbh, spec=>$spec);
     die "Cannot run the application: cannot create/upgrade database schema: $res->[1]"
         unless $res->[0] == 200;

    This way, your program automatically creates/updates database schema
    when run. Users need not know anything.

FAQ

 Why use this module instead of other similar solution?

    Mainly simplicity. I write simple application which is often
    self-contained in a single module/script. This module works with
    embedded SQL statements instead of having to put SQL in separate
    files/subdirectory.

 How do I see each SQL statement as it is being executed?

    Try using Log::Any::For::DBI, e.g.:

     % TRACE=1 perl -MLog::Any::For::DBI -MLog::Any::App yourapp.pl ...

BEST PRACTICES

    It is recommended that after you create the second and subsequent
    version (upgrade_to_v2, upgrade_to_v3, and so on) you create and keep
    install_v1 so you can test migration from v1->v2, v2->v3, and so on.

SEE ALSO

    Some other database migration tools on CPAN:

      * DBIx::Migration

      Pretty much similar to this module, with support for downgrades. OO
      style, SQL in separate files/subdirectory.

      * Database::Migrator

      Pretty much similar. OO style, SQL in separate files/subdirectory.
      Perl scripts can also be executed for each version upgrade. Meta
      table is configurable (default recommended is 'AppliedMigrations').

      * sqitch

      A more proper database change management tool with dependency
      resolution and VCS awareness. No numbering. Command-line script and
      Perl library provided. Looks pretty awesome and something which I
      hope to use for more complex applications.
