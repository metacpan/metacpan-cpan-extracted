Revision history for Perl module Data::IEEE754::Tools.

v0.016 2016-Aug-29
    - had a bug in v0.014 Makefile which caused CPAN to not
      index; tried a couple of submissions, none of which
      really did what I wanted.  Will try to move up to next
      public release version number (v0.016), and ask PAUSE
      to forget the incorrect v0.14001.0 release, and hopefully
      re-index to this release.

v0.014 2016-Aug-29
    - feature request <https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=116155>
      + add many functions
        :ulp => ulp, nextUp, nextDown, nextAfter
        :info => isSignMinus, isNormal, isFinite, isNaN, isSignaling,
            isSignalingConvertedToQuiet, isCanonical, class, radix, totalOrder,
            totalOrderMag, compareFloatingValue, compareFloatingMag
        :signbit => copy, negate, abs, copySign, isSignMinus
    - feature request <https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=116154>
      + add :constants
    - feature request <https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=116153>
      + update ulp() with new, faster method

v0.013
    - Odd versions are development versions, used for developing and verifying
      new features and bug fixes.  There may have been one or more alpha
      subversions (v0.013_001, etc).

v0.012 2016-Jul-14
    - test coverage: Devel::Cover showed two conditionals which can only ever
        trigger one of the two (impossible to hit the opposite); remove the
        unnecessary conditional
    - bugfix <https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=116005>: get SNAN,
        expect QNAN
      - original code always expected QNAN, because all of the developer's
        machines automatically quiet SNAN to QNAN
      - v0.011_001: Test suite for :floatingpoint now converts SNAN to expect
        /[SQ]NAN/, because it doesn't really matter that much whether Perl
        silences a signaling NAN
    - bugfix <https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=116006>
      - getting NAN instead of expected value on nextup(NEGATIVE NORMAL) or
        nextdown(POSITIVE NORMAL)
      - v0.011_001: when LSB underflows (goes to -1), the hexification is too
          many F's; misinterpreted when the two were being recombined, so masked
          the MSB and LSB before merging
    - bugfix <https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=116004>
      - test suite getting -0.160000000000000003 when expecting -0.16
      - caused by systems with $Config{nvsize} > 8: code expected 64bit NV (some
        CPAN Testers have 128bit NV)
      - v0.011_002: change test suite to only compare enough significant figures
        for a 64bit double, so that even 128bit floats (quad?) will pass
      - v0.011_004: added documentation to explain that the module expects
        64bit NV, rounds off more-precise NV floats to 64bit, and will fail
        tests on 32bit NV (but might coerce to 64bit floats and might still
        "work" if the installation is forced)

v0.011
    - Odd versions are development versions, used for developing and verifying
      new features and bug fixes.  There may have been one or more alpha
      subversions (v0.011_001, etc).
