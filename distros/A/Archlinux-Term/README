Archlinux::Term - Print messages to the terminal in Archlinux style

* Background
  Archlinux has a distinctive and simple style for displaying messages
  on the terminal. This style is used in the init scripts and pacman
  to give a cohesive look to Archlinux's terminal. This module makes
  it easy to use that style in your perl scripts.

* Installation
  To install this module follow these steps. If you have already
  downloaded and extracted the distribution tarball in order to read
  this README file skip to step 4.
  
  1) Download the distribution tarball from CPAN.
  2) Extract the tarball.
  3) *cd* into the extracted directory (Archlinux-Term-<version>)
  4) Run *perl Makefile.PL* to create a *Makefile*
  5) Run *make* to build the module using the *Makefile*
  6) (Optional) Run *make test* to run automated self-tests.
  7) Run *make install* to install the perl module into a system directory.

  Or better yet use a CPAN shell to do it for you! Cpanminus is available
  on CPAN under the name "App-cpanminus".

** Example
