NAME

DynaLoader::Functions - deconstructed dynamic C library loading

DESCRIPTION

This module provides a function-based interface to dynamic loading as used
by Perl.  Some details of dynamic loading are very platform-dependent,
so correct use of these functions requires the programmer to be mindful
of the space of platform variations.

INSTALLATION

	perl Build.PL
	./Build
	./Build test
