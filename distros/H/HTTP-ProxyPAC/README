    This version will use the JavaScript module and I<libjs> from 
    Mozilla, if it finds JavaScript installed.  Otherwise it will use 
    the JE module as its JavaScript interpreter, so that CPAN or 
    CPANPLUS can do the whole installation.

    This module is being developed to provide access for Perl scripts 
    to the Proxy Auto Config format from Netscape.  The original 
    description is now archived at:
    
    http://linuxmafia.com/faq/Web/autoproxy.html
     
    HTTP::ProxyPAC allows use of a Proxy Auto Configuration file to
    find an appropriate proxy for a URL.  You can use a .pac file 
    from Firefox, IE or Opera, or a wpad.dat file obtained via the 
    WPAD protocol (see 2nd link in DESCRIPTION).
