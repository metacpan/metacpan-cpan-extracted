* cpantesters looks good besides Win32. Waiting for someone from windows
  world to care/submit patch

Todd Rinaldo March 29 2011 v0.14_01
* Mmap could not handle files larger than 2GB if perl was not using 64bit int.
  Resolved the problem by taking a string and converting it via atoll,
  depending on _FILE_OFFSET_BITS > 32
* Added test and fix to croak if a negative offset is passed in.
* initialize global variable pagesize = 0 so it'll set right the first time
* Remove typemap which was only used by mmap sub. Now we're using SV,
  it's no longer an issue.
