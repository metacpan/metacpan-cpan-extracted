  * Bunch of changes by David Wheeler, granting a minor version++ :)
    Note that changes about stringifying child elements may have affect
    some users. Drop me a line if you have a problem.

  - Add support for xml:base in RSS 2.0. (theory)
  - Parse and include items in RSS 2.0 feeds without a title or description. (theory)
  - The encoding() method now returns the encoding of a parsed feed. (theory)
  - Parser recognizes elements that should not have children and stringifies 
    the children of such elements when it finds children. (theory)

0.3005 - 3 Jun 2010
  - rt #58067 Document create_libxml() (theory)
  - rt #58068 Add support for RSS 0.92 (theory)

0.3004 - 20 Jan 2009
  - rt #42536. Some files were removed from the distro for the time being.
    (I don't have the time to re-create these for now -- patch submissions
    are most welcome)

0.3003 - 26 Nov 2008
  - Try not to die if we encountered a Broken <image> tag in RSS 2.0
  - We won't test RSS 0.9x. This is due to the nature of libxml wanting to
    validate the DTD, when the namespaces have been changed
    (see http://blog.netscape.com/2008/01/22/rss-specifications-moving-to-rss-advisory-board/)
    We could use a hackish fix, but we won't, as it may change the behavior
    for this widely used format (which is surprisingly large number).
    So instead, we'll just silence the tests, to stop odd failures from occurring
  - For practical purposes, we use the old namespace unless asked
    otherwise via XML_RSS_LIBXML_USE_NEW_RSS09 environment variable

0.3002 - 08 Oct 2007
  - Apply fix from AAR (rt #29683) to make things work with XML::LibXML >= 1.64

0.3001 - 09 May 2007
  - Fix Makefile.PL dependency
  - Remove stray debug output

0.30 - 08 May 2007
  - Move to Module::Install
  - Tweak tests.

0.30_02 - 23 Mar 2007
  - Make things more compatible with t/items-are-0.t

0.30_01 - 14 Mar 2007
  - BEWARE! MAJOR CHANGE IN CODE!
  - Compatiblity with XML::RSS-1.29_02's test suite.
  - Completely redo the internal structure in a saner manner.

0.23 - 05 Jul 2006
  - Apply multiple enclosure patch from SERGEYCHE (rt #20285)
    This allows you to *generate* RSS with multiple enclosures

0.22 - 28 Jun 2006
  - Remove stray files and debug statements (rt #19939)

0.21 - 31 May 2006
  - Repository blunder messes up the distro. fixed.
    Reported by Tatsuhiko Miyagawa

0.20 - 14 May 2006
  - Set $rss->{version} for compatibility.
  - As a result, we no longer set or depend on $rss->{_internal}{version}.
    If you saw it and used it, then stop doing that ;)

0.19 - 17 Apr 2006
  - Fixed bug where $rss->channel('title') and such would give you the
    non-UTF8 representation when another encoding is specified in the
    RSS document (reported by Tatsuhiko Miyagawa)

0.18 - 06 Mar 2006
  - Fixed bug where extra modules were not included in the output string.
    (reported by Tatsuhiko Miyagawa)

0.17 - 05 Mar 2006
  - s/getValue/getData/g (reported by Tatsuhiko Miyagawa)
  - Add caveat: namespaced attributes aren't parsed correctly

0.16 - 28 Feb 2006
  - Fix namespace support for RSS 2.0. Reported by various people.

0.15 - 06 Jan 2006
  - Fix cpan #16748, and now we can parse RSS 0.91.
    Patch provided by aar@cpan.org
  - Add tests for 0.91

0.14 - 20 Nov 2005
  - Bah, stupid POD msitakes. No code change

0.13 - 18 Nov 2005
  - XML::RSS::LibXML wasn't conforming to the XML::RSS interface on
    channel(), image() and textinput() methods. Reported by
    Taro Minowa.
  - Make POD tests run only on disttest

0.12 - 09 Nov 2005
  - Ugh, need to use Test::Pod::Coverage more carefully.
    Reported by various people.

0.11 - 19 Oct 2005
  - Most files were mysteriously not included in the previous release.

0.10 - 18 Oct 2005
  - Mainly a kwalitee improvement release. Added bunch of POD and tests
  - Fix: Allow XML::RSS::LibXML constructor to accept encoding. Currently
    this just controls the output encoding, not the internal representation

0.09 - 17 Aug 2005
  - Various fixes to make $rss->parse($rss->as_string) work. However,
    it turns out that since XML::RSS doesn't parse <-> generate RSS
    in a way that allows 100% of the cases to work, I've decided to
    stop it at a "good enough" state.
  - taxo: parses correctly
  - use exists() to prevent autovivification

0.08 - 17 Aug 2005 ("Insanity" Release)
  - In a fit of insanity, I've implemented RSS generation code.
    Currently RSS version 0.9, 1.0, and 2.0 are supported.
  - You can now parse RSS, serialize it via as_string(), parse it again, and
    get (almost) the same structure back.
  - Separated out RSS parsing/generation code from main module. These modules
    are loaded as necessary, or by demand.
  - Updated benchmark.

0.07 - 15 Aug 205
  - Document MagicElements in the main docs.
  - Create XPathContext at parse time, andd call registerNs() only then.
  - Update benchmark for fairness. 
  - Changed code to use eh, cleaner Test::More code
  - Removed unused code

0.06 - 10 Aug 2005 ("Magic Is In The Air" Release)
  - Introduce MagicElement.pm. This allows us to parse RSS elements
    that have attributes without sacrificing the interface (hopefully).
    Inspired by patch from Taro Minowa.

0.05 - 04 Jul 2005 ("I'm so dumb" Release)
  - Make $item->{$namespace_uri}->{$tag} work. Patch by Naoya Ito.
  - Add corresponding tests. Patch by Naoya Ito.

0.04 - 21 Jun 2005
  - No code change.
  - Clarify compatibility issues.
  - Fix typos

0.03 - 21 Jun 2005
  - channel() fix by Naoya Ito (compatibility with XML::RSS)

0.02 - 21 Jun 2005
  - Doc tweaks.
  - This be 0.02. Remember to read the backward incompatible changes
    below.

0.01_01 - 20 Jun 2005
  - Typo in Build.PL/Makefile.PL (Tatsuhiko Miyagawa)

  **** Backwards Incompatible Change ****
  - Make namespace handling the same as XML::RSS - e.g.,
    <content:encoded> is now parsed as $item->{content}->{encoded}.
    (thanks to Tatsuhiko Miyagawa for suggestions)
  - Remove add_parse_context(), as it is no longer necessary.
  - Parsing is now done only on nodes that are immediately under
    <channel> and <item>. This is not correct spec-wise, but it does the
    job for most of the RSS out there.

0.01 - 14 Jun 2005
  - Seems like some people just think about the same thing. Tatsuhiko
    Miyagawa caught me doing some of the same thing he was doing in an
    unrelease module, so merged some features from his :)
  - Added add_module() (Tatsuhiko Miyagawa)
  - Added as_string() (Tatsuhiko Miyagawa)
  - Added add_parse_context().
  - Added fields to be parsed by default.
  - Changed internal representation a bit.

0.01_02 - 14 June 2005
  - Doc screw up

0.01_01 - 14 June 2005
  - Initial CPAN release
