NAME
    Catalyst::Action::FromPSGI - Use a PSGI app as a Catalyst action

VERSION
    version 0.001006

SYNOPSIS
    First, you have a psgi app you wrote and want to use:

     package MyApp::WS::App;

     use Web::Simple;

     has name => (
        is => 'ro',
        required => 1,
     );

     sub dispatch_request {
        sub (/hi) {
           [ 200,
              [ 'Content-type' => 'text/plain' ],
              [ 'Hello ' . $_[0]->name ]
           ]
        },
     }

     1;

    Now you want to reuse this app in a Catalyst action:

     package MyApp::Controller::HelloName;

     use base 'Catalyst::Controller';

     sub say_hi :Path('/say_hi_to') ActionClass('FromPSGI') {
       my ($self, $c, $name, @args) = @_;

       MyApp::WS::App->new(name => $name)->to_psgi_app
     }

     1;

    The above would yield 'Hello fREW' for the request to
    "/say_hi_to/fREW/hi".

    Of course the above example is contrived, but keep in mind this will
    work for any of the myriad PSGI apps out there.

DESCRIPTION
    "Catalyst::Action::FromPSGI" gives you a handy way to mount PSGI apps
    under Catalyst actions.

    Note that because Catalyst is in control of the dispatch cycle any
    limitations you place on it will be placed on the PSGI app as well. So
    for example:

     sub foo : Path('/foo') Args(1) ActionClass('FromPSGI') { ... }

    will never run the PSGI app if the url is "/foo/bar/baz" because the
    Catalyst dispatcher won't even match for more than one argument. For
    this reason I recommend leaving "Args" unspecified for "FromPSGI"
    actions.

    I actually made this because I'm interested in using Web::Machine
    instead of Catalyst::Action::REST and possibly even replacing my
    chaining code with Web::Simple based dispatching.

THANKS
    Matt S. Trout - for pioneering the actual guts of this code. Stevan
    Little - for porting Web::Machine, my motivation for making this.
