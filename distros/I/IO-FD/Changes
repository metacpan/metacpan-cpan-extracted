Revision history for Perl extension IO::FD.

0.1.3   Tue 15 Nov 2022 20:45:17 AEST
	- Added accept_multiple routine
	- Fixed IPv6 address corruption bug.
		  Not enough space was allocated for IPv6 addresses. Now using struct
		  sockaddr_storage instead of struct sockaddr for sizing.
	- Fixed sockaddr allocation
		Routines returning packed sockaddr structures now have SvCUR
		forced to length of INET/INET6/UNIX sockaddr types. This stops
		Socket::unpack_sockaddr_in6 for example complaining the length
		of the SV is too long for the address family.
	- Documented accept_multiple and small POD typo fixes.
	- Fixed potential blocking hang in pipe test.
	  	It attempted to read more data than was written
	- Disabled  stat testing. IO::FD::stat is currently broken, to be fixed...


0.1.2	Sun 23 Oct 2022 18:38:07 AEST
	- Fixed failing peername test due to 'Temporary failure in name resolution'
	- Added shutdown to IO::FD and IO::FD::DWIM

	- IO::FD::recv now returns single element, like perl

	- IO::FD::mkstemp returns undef for second item
		- This is a stop gap until a cross platform 'fd=>path' is implemented
	- IO::FD::mktemp  and IO::FD::mkstemp now requires 6 'X' characters for better compatibility (linux)
	- Fixed IO:FD::readline to actually work as documented.
	- Added tests for IO::FD::readline
