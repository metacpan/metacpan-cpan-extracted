I'm sorry if this sounds pedantic, but because the second argument is a
node list, the above expression will be true if *any* of the preceding
siblings nodes has an attribute named "foo" of the equal value.

To check the immediately preceding element for an attribute named "foo", I
would think one would use:

   <xsl:if test="@foo = preceding-sibling::*[1]/@foo">

To check the the closest (in proximity) preceding element with an attribute
named "foo", I would think one would use:

   <xsl:if test="@foo = preceding-sibling::*[@foo][1]/@foo">

I hope this helps and is considered constructive.

XDR was a predecessor to XML Schema developed with DataChannel and others,
and Microsoft is just as involved and supportive of XML Schema as we were
with XDR.  XML Schema is still not ratified, and we like everyone else are
supporting the standard as it evolves.  BTW, Lee specifically mentions
MSXML3, which does have XSLT support.  The older parser that shipped with
IE5 had more limited support based on earlier drafts.  There is an XSLT
stylesheet at
http://msdn.microsoft.com/downloads/webtechnology/xml/xsltconv.asp which
will convert older stylesheets to the new XSLT format.

Hello Lee,

concede-admin very conveniently hit both myself and Adam, so Gerald does
not need to take any further action.

Gerald mentioned your work to me last time we spoke and I'm very much
looking forward to seeing the results.

I'm sending by separate email the postscript version of the (single)
paper that was the basis of the two presentations you mentioned. Please
not however that this is an UNPUBLISHED PROJECT-INTERNAL document and
should not be cited or distributed without the authors' express
permission (this is not because its secret, but because it will probably
change form, title and maybe even authorship before it does get
published somehow.)

best wishes

Roger

Took a look at DATR - wow, a very powerful, very simple model. I bet you
could have implemented most of XML-Schema in it at a fraction of the
complexity. Has it been used much outside linguistics?

How are you getting on with the XSLT? What you're attempting sounds very
do-able - especially if you have a copy of Mike Kay's book...

Let me know if you have any interesting problems - it's a while since I
coughed up for my copy of LPA Micro Prolog (for DOS!) but with hindsight
it was a really useful non-procedural skill, probably still paying off
whenever I bump into another non-procedural language - like XSLT itself.

Anyway, I like debugging interesting programming problems...

(Hmmm... presumably you could do a *certain* amount just by using XSLT
as the target language as well as the transform language)

Francis.

ps - you anything to do with the Concede people who seem to be doing
SGML/XML -> DATR at the University of Brighton
(http://www.itri.brighton.ac.uk/projects/concede/DR0.2.1_no_pointers.html)
- are they neighbours?

<xsl:template match="/">

  <xsl:apply-templates/>
</xsl:template>

<xsl:template match="*">
  <!-- stuff to do for each element here -->
  <!-- when done, go process this element's child elements -->

Replace <!-- stuff to do... --> with the appropriate code, depending on
the output you want. Example:

<xsl:value-of select="concat(name(),': ',text(),'&#xA;')"/>
<xsl:for-each select="@*">
  <xsl:value-of select="concat('   ',name(),': ',text(),'&#xA;')"/>
</xsl:for-each>

would give you something like:

element1: text1
  attribute1a: value1a
  attribute1b: value1b
element2: text2
  attribute2a: value2a
element3: text3

etc.
