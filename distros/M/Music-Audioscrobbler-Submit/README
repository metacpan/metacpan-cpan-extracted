NAME
    Music::Audioscrobbler::Submit - Module providing routines to submit
    songs to last.fm using 1.2 protocol.

DESCRIPTION
    Music::Audioscrobbler::Submit is a scrobbler for MPD implementing the
    1.2 protocol, including "Now Playing' feature.

    Items are submitted and stored in a queue. This queue is stored as a
    file using Tie::File. When you submit a track, it will add the queue to
    the track and process the queue. If it submits all items in the queue,
    the submit() method will return true. A method called
    process_scrobble_queue() allows you to try again in case of failure. Do
    not submit songs more than once!

INSTALLATION
    To install this module type the following:

       perl Makefile.PL
       make
       make test
       make install

DEPENDENCIES
    This module requires these other modules and libraries:

       Encode
       File::Spec
       Digest::MD5
       Config::Options
       LWP
       Tie::File
       Music::Tag

METHODS
    new()
            my $mas = Music::Audioscrobbler::Submit->new($options);

    options()
        Get or set options via hash. Here is a list of available options:

        lastfm_username
            lastfm username

        lastfm_password
            lastfm password. Not needed if lastfm_md5password is set.

        lastfm_md5password
            MD5 hash of lastfm password.

        lastfm_client_id
            Client ID provided by last.fm. Defaults to "tst", which is valid
            for testing only.

        lastfm_client_version
            Set to the version of your program when setting a valid
            client_id. Defaults to "1.0"

        verbose
            Set verbosity level (1 through 4)

        logfile
            File to output log info to. If set to "STDERR" or undef, will
            print messages to STDERR. If set to "STDOUT" will print messages
            to STDOUT.

        scrobble_queue
            Path to file to queue info to. Defaults to
            ~/.musicaudioscrobbler_queue

        get_mbid_from_mb
            Use the Music::Tag::MusicBrainz plugin to get missing "mbid"
            value. Defaults false.

        musictag
            True if you want to use Music::Tag to get info from file. This
            is important if you wish to use filenames to submit from.

        musictag_overwrite
            True if you want to Music::Tag info to override file info.
            Defaults to false, which with the unicode problems with
            Music::Tag is a good thing.

        music_tag_opts
            Options for Music::Tag

        proxy_server
            URL for proxy_server in the form http://my.proxy.ca:8080

    default_options()
        Returns a reference to the default options.

    now_playing()
        Takes a file, hashref, or Music::Tag object and submits the song to
        Last.FM now playing info. For example:

            $mas->now_playing("/path/to/file.mp3");

        The hash reference is of the form:

                { artist   => "Artist Name",   # Mandatory
                  title    => "Song Title"     # Mandatory
                  secs     => 300,             # Length of time in seconds (integers only please). Mandatory
                  album    => "Album",         # Optional
                  tracknum => 12,              # Optional
                  mbid     => '6299a467-95bc-4bc1-925d-71c4e556770d'  # Optional
                }
 
    submit()
        To submit a song pass an arrayref whose first entry is a File,
        Music::Tag object, or hashref (see now_playing()) for format) and
        whose second entry is an integer representing the seconds since
        epoch (UNIX time). Several songs can be submitted simultaneously.
        For example:

            $mas->submit->(["/path/to/file.mp3", time]);

        or:

            $mas->submit->( ["/var/mp3s/song1.mp3", time - 600 ], 
                            ["/var/mp3s/song2.mp3", time - 300 ], 
                            ["/var/mp3s/song3.mp3", time ] );

        Returns true if song was scrobbled, false otherwise. submit calls
        process_scrobble_queue(). If it fails, process_scrobble_queue() can
        be called again.

        The following is taken from
        http://www.audioscrobbler.net/development/protocol/:

        The client should monitor the user's interaction with the music
        playing service to whatever extent the service allows. In order to
        qualify for submission all of the following criteria must be met:

        1. The track must be submitted once it has finished playing. Whether
        it has finished playing naturally or has been manually stopped by
        the user is irrelevant.

        2. The track must have been played for a duration of at least 240
        seconds or half the track's total length, whichever comes first.
        Skipping or pausing the track is irrelevant as long as the
        appropriate amount has been played.

        3. The total playback time for the track must be more than 30
        seconds. Do not submit tracks shorter than this.

        4. Unless the client has been specially configured, it should not
        attempt to interpret filename information to obtain metadata instead
        of tags (ID3, etc).

    process_scrobble_queue()
        Processes the current scrobble queue. Call this if submit fails and
        you wish to try again. Do not resubmit a song.

    handshake()
        Perform handshake with Last.FM. You don't need to call this, it will
        be called by submit() or now_playing() when necessary.

    music_tag_opts()
        Get or set the current options for new Music::Tag objects.

    logfileout()
        Glob reference (or IO::File) to current log file. If passed a value,
        will use this instead of what the logfile option is set to. Any glob
        reference that can be printed to will work (that's all we ever do).

    status()
        Print to log. First argument is a level (0 - 4). For example:

            $mas->status($level, @message);

    scrobble_queue()
        Returns a reference to the current scrobble_queue. This is a tied
        hash using Tie::File. Useful to found out how many items still need
        to be scrobbled after a failed submit().

    ua()
        Returns the LWP::UserAgent used. If passed a value, will use that as
        the new LWP::UserAgent object.

    info_to_hash()
        Takes a filename, hashref, or Music::Tag object and returns a hash
        with the structure required by submit() or now_playing. Normally
        this is called automatically by submit() or now_playing. See
        now_playing for syntax of hash.

        Examples:

            my $hash = $mas->info_to_hash("/path/to/mp3/file.mp3");

        is functionally equivalent to

            my $hash = $mas->info_to_hash(Music::Tag->new("/path/to/mp3/file.mp3", $mas->music_tag_opts() ));

CHANGES
    Release Name: 0.05
        *   Added new option: proxy_server to set proxy_server. Also now
            reads proxy server from enviroment.

    Release Name: 0.04
        *   I noticed that Music::Tag was called with a use function.
            Removed this line to remove Music::Tag requirement.

        *   Added some more level 4 debuging messages.

    Release Name: 0.03
        *   Added musictag_overwrite option. This is false by default. It is
            a workaround for problems with Music::Tag and unicode. Setting
            this to true allows Music::Tag info to overwrite info from MPD.
            Do not set this to true until Music::Tag returns proper unicode
            consistantly.

    Release Name: 0.02
        *   Will print error and die if lastfm_password is not set.

        *   Will print error and die if BADAUTH is received.

    Release Name: 0.01
        *   Initial Release
