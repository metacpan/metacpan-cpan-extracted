  Lots o Documentation Updates

  (From Paul J. Schinder)
   - bugfix for encrypt without signing

  (For Jesse)
   - verify(): return uid/email on success
   - new methods: is_signed() and is_encrypted(), which are
     encapsulations of the simple tests for guessing whether something
     is signed or encrypted.

   - get_decrypt_key(): fix for gpg not in current path
   - decrypt(): return uid/email on successful decrypt of signed msg

   - verify() : fix tempfile creation location

0.06   Wed Jul 23 19:59:51 PDT 2003

  (From Jörn Reder)
   - bugfix in decrypt(): with ASCII armor messages the first line of
   the cleartext was removed by MIME::Parser, if the cleartext was no
   entity but simple ASCII text.

   - new method get_decrypt_key() which returns a secret key and the
   corresponding mail address, which could be used to decrypt a given
   encrypted message.


0.05  Thu Jun 12 23:05:48 PDT 2003

  (From Jörn Reder)
  - insecure temp file handling (still insecure, but not that much ;)
  - non portable temp directory handling
  - insecure temp file / MIME::Parser handling in decrypt()
  - broken signature verification on quoted printable ascii armor messages
  - broken MIME canonical conversion (was broken if single CR's or
    CR/LF sequences were already in the message)
  - removed line break mangling in mime_encrypt(). RFC3156 doesn't
    request it.

  new methods:

  clear_sign()        - clearsign the body of an email message
  ascii_encrypt()     - encrypt an email message body using ascii armor
  ascii_signencrypt() - encrypt and sign an email message body using
			ascii armor
