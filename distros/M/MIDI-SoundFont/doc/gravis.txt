The Gravis Ultrasound Patch File Format
http://www.fileformat.info/format/gravis/corion.htm

The GF1 Patch files are multipart sound files for the Gravis Ultrasound
sound card to emulate MIDI sounds in high quality. Each Patch can consist
of many samples (for example, a string ensemble consists of Violin,
Viola, Cello, Bass) which are played depending on the note to play.
A patch can also contain a part to be played before the loop
and a part to be played after the tone has been released.

0055h                   1 byte   Number of voices for sample
0056h                   1 byte   Number of output channels
                                 (1=mono,2=stereo)

0059h                   1 word   Master volume for all samples
005Bh                   1 dword  Size of the following data
0060h                  36 byte   reserved

Following this header, the instruments with their headers follow.
An instrument header contains the name and other data
about one instrument contained within the patch.

OFFSET              Count TYPE   Description
0000h                   1 word   Instrument number. ?Maybe the MIDI instrument
                                 number?. In the Gravis patches, this is 0, in
                                 other patches, I found random values.
0002h                  16 char   ASCII name of the instrument.
0012h                   1 dword  Size of the whole instrument in bytes.
0016h                   1 byte   Layers. Needed for whatever.
0017h                  40 byte   reserved

About the patch, I don't know anything. Maybe somebody could enlighten me.
Each patch record has the following format :
