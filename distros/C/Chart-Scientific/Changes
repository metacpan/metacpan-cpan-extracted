Revision history for Perl extension Chart::Scientific.

0.16  ??? ?? ??? ??:??:?? 2004
	- For consistency with the rest of the parameters, which have a [xy]_
      naming scheme, I changed the names of the following parameters:
          xcol      -> x_col      
          xdata     -> x_data     
          xlabel    -> x_label    
          xlog      -> x_log      
          xrange    -> x_range   
          ycol      -> y_col      
          ydata     -> y_data    
          yerr_col  -> y_err_col  
          yerr_data -> y_err_data 
          ylabel    -> y_label    
          ylog      -> y_log      
          yrange    -> y_range.
      The old [xy] style is supported but depreciated.

0.14  Thu 09 Dec 09:37:00 2004
	- Problems with test more prenicious than I thought.  They succeede with "perl t/Chart-Scientific", but not "make test".  Problem with my machine? Removed most tests for now.
