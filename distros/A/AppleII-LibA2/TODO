LibA2                            Things to Do                       $%    11d%$
===============================================================================

This is a list of features that could be added to LibA2.  They are
organized by file, and ranked on a scale of 1 to 10, where 10 means
"I'm planning to do this right away", and 1 means "I may get around to
this, if there's a blizzard and I'm stuck in the house for a month".

If you'd like to attempt one of these projects, contact me at
<perl AT cjmweb.net>.  Many of them aren't very difficult; I just have
other things to do.

    1	Allow read/write by track & sector on ProDOS-order disk images

    1	Write these modules to access DOS 3.3 and Apple Pascal disk images
