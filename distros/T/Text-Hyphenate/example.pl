In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.  And the earth
was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the
deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.  And
God said, Let there be light: and there was light.  And God saw the
light, that it was good: and God divided the light from the darkness.
And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night.  And
the evening and the morning were the first day.

And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and
let it divide the waters from the waters.  And God made the firmament,
and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters
which were above the firmament: and it was so.  And God called the
firmament Heaven. And the evening and the morning were the second day.
And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together
unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so.  And God
called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters
called he Seas: and God saw that it was good.

And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the
waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good.  And God said,
Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit
tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the
earth: and it was so.  And the earth brought forth grass, and herb
yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed
was in itself, after his kind: and God saw that it was good.  And the
evening and the morning were the third day.
