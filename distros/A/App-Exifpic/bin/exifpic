=head1 NAME

exifpic - Extract embedded jpegs from RAW camera files.

=head1 VERSION

version 0.02

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    # Extract embedded jpegs from all .CR2 files in the current dir

    $ exifpic *.CR2

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a super-simple program to extract embedded (full-size) jpegs
from RAW camera files.  EXIF headers are copied to the new file, which
will always have the same name as the old file, but with a .jpg extension.

The code will use as many cores as you have available, and assumes you're
running a threaded perl.

The code will always scale pictures so the longest side is 2048px or less.
A patch to allow users to select sizes would be great. :)

=head1 BUGS

Plenty! The code assumes you have a F</proc/cpuinfo> so it can count
cores. It's only been tested on Canon .CR2 files. There are probably
more.

Patches are I<super-welcome>.  You can find the code repo at
L<https://github.com/pfenwick/app-exifpic> .
