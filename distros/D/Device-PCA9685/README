NAME

    Device::PCA9685 - I2C interface to PCA9685 16 channel 12 bit PWM
    Generator

VERSION

    version 0.004

SYNOPSIS

         use Device::PWMGenerator::PCA9685;
     
         my $dev = Device::PWMGenerator::PCA9685->new(
             I2CBusDevicePath => '/dev/i2c-1', # this would be '//dev/i2c-dev-0 for Model A Pi
             debug            => 1,
             frequency        => 400, #Hz
         );
         $dev->enable();
         $dev->setChannelPWM(4,0,$dutycycle); # Duty cycle values between 0 and 4096 channel 4

DESCRIPTION

    This module provides a Object oriented interface to Adafruit 16 channel
    12 bit PWM Generator(PCA9685). Before you use this module make sure you
    follow install Prerequisites for Device::SMBus

ATTRIBUTES

 I2CBusDevicePath

    this is the device file path for your I2CBus that the PCA9685 is
    connected on e.g. /dev/i2c-1 This must be provided during object
    creation.

 PWMGenerator

        $self->PWMGenerator->enable();
        $self->PWMGenerator->setChannelPWM($channel,$pulseOnPoint,$pulseOffPoint);

    The PCA9685 offers a 12 bit resolution which means across a duty cycle
    you may set and unset the PWM at 4096 different point. Range of values
    for $pulseOnPoint and $pulseOffPoint is 0 to 4095 Range of values of
    $channel is 0 to 15

    This is a object of Device::PWMGenerator::PCA9685
