=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<dh-make-perl> will create the files required to build
a debian source package out of a Perl module or CPAN distribution.
This works for most simple packages and is also useful
for getting started with packaging Perl modules.

You can specify a module or distribution name with the L<--cpan>
switch and B<dh-make-perl> will download it for you from a CPAN mirror, or you
can specify the directory with the already unpacked sources. If neither
L<--cpan> nor a directory is given as argument, B<dh-make-perl>
tries to create a Perl package from the data in the current directory.

You can build and install the debian binary package using the
L</--build> and L</--install> command line switches.

If B<dh-make-perl> is called as

    cpan2deb <options...> Foo::Bar

it behaves like

    dh-make-perl make <options...> --build --cpan Foo::Bar

If B<dh-make-perl> is called as

    cpan2dsc <options...> Foo::Bar

it behaves like

    dh-make-perl make <options...> --build-source --cpan Foo::Bar

Using this program is no excuse for not reading the
debian developer documentation, including the Debian policy,
the Debian Perl policy, the packaging manual and so on.

=head2 COMMANDS

=over

=item make

Default command if no command is given. Creates debianisation from scratch.
Fails with an error if F<debian/> directory already exists.

=item refresh [directory]

For refreshing a package. C<directory> defaults to the current working
directory. Rebuilds F<debian/copyright>, F<debian/rules>, F<debian/compat>
using the current templates. Before any changes are made to these files, a
backup copy is created with a .bak suffix.

This is useful when F<debian/rules> was created using older templates and
doesn't contain much customisations. As always, you're strongly encouraged to
verify if F<debian/rules> looks sane.

C<refresh> also tries to update dependency lists in F<debian/control> from
F<META.yml>. It hooks L<quilt(1)> into F<debian/rules> and creates
F<debian/README.source>

When updating F<debian/copyright> dh-make-perl tries to be clever about
remembering email addresses. It gets the list of copyright holders and their
emails for F<debian/*> from the sign off lines in F<debian/changelog>.
However to allow for email addresses changing, it looks for change lines
of the form

      * Email change: Debbie Devlin -> devlin@debian.org

So now C<Debbie Devlin E<lt>devlin@debian.orgE<gt>> will be used in the copyright
instead of C<Debbie Devlin E<lt>debbie@devlin.orgE<gt>>.

=item B<--only> | B<-o> I<control|copyright|docs|examples|rules>

This option allows one to update only one or more file(s) in the debian/
directory when B<dh-make-perl> is run in L</refresh> mode. Filenames are
separated by a comma. The option can be given multiple times, accumulating
arguments.

=item locate I<MODULE> ...

Tries to locate the package that conains the given Perl I<MODULE>s.

Example:

    dh-make-perl locate IPC::Run3 XML::Tidy

=item refresh-cache

B<dh-make-perl> parses the Contents files, fetched by L<apt-file(1)> and stores
the result in a cache. The cache is refreshed automatically if it is older than
any Contents file. However, if you run L<apt-file(1)> in your nightly cron job,
the first time you run B<dh-make-perl> during the day, you shall wait for the
cache to be reconstructed. With this option, you can move the cache re-creation
to the cron job, right after C<apt-file update>.

Does nothing if the cache is newer that the Contents files.

=item dump-config

Causes the current config, including any default settings to be printed to the
standard output.

Useful for populating L<dh-make-perl.conf> file.

=item help

Displays short usage information.

=back

=head2 OPTIONS

=over

=item B<--apt-contents-dir> I<dir>

Location of L<apt-file> Contents directory. Default is
F</var/cache/apt/apt-file>

=item B<--arch> I<any> | I<all>

This switches between arch-dependent and arch-independet packages. If B<--arch>
isn't used, B<dh-make-perl> uses a relatively good-working algorithms to
decide this alone.

=item B<--backups> | B<--no-backups>

In L</refresh> mode, create backups of F<debian/copyright> and
F<debian/rules> before overwritting them. On by default.

=item B<--basepkgs>

Explicitly gives a comma-separated list of packages to consider "base"
packages (i.e. packages that should always be available in Debian
systems). This option defaults to C<perl,perl-base> - it
is used to check for module dependencies. If a needed module is in the
C<basepkgs>, it won't be mentioned in the C<depends:> field of
C<debian/control>.

If this option is specified, the above mentioned default packages will
not be included (but will be mentioned as explicit dependencies in the
resulting package). You can, of course, mention your own modules
and explicitly specify the default values.

Note that this option should be used sparsingly and with care, as it
might lead to packages not being rebuildable because of unfulfilled
dependencies.

=item B<--bdepends> I<BUILD-DEPENDS>

Manually specify the string to be used for the module's build-dependencies
(that is, the packages and their versions that have to be installed in order to
successfully build the package). Keep in mind that packages generated by
B<dh-make-perl> require debhelper to be specified as a build dependency. Same note
as for --depends applies here - use only when needed.

=item B<--bdependsi> I<BUILD-DEPENDS-INDEP>

Manually specify the string to be used for the module's build-dependencies
for architecture-independent builds. Same notes as those for the --depends
and --bdepends options apply here.

Note that for --depends, --bdepends and --bdependsi you can also specify that
the field should not appear in debian/rules (if you really mean it, of course
;-) ) by giving it an empty string as an argument.

=item B<--build>

Builds the binary package (i.e. the .deb file) after setting the
package directory up.

NB: This builds only a binary package (by calling "fakeroot debian/rules
binary") and does not sign the package. It is meant for a quick local
install of a package, not for creating a package ready for submission to the
Debian archive.

=item B<--build-source>

Builds the source package (i.e. the .dsc and .debian.tar.gz files)
after setting the package directory up.

NB: This builds only a source package (by calling "dpkg-source -b")
and does not sign the package. It is meant for a quick local install
of a source package to be thrown into e.g. a pbuilder, not for
creating a source package ready for submission to the Debian archive.

=item B<--closes> I<ITPBUG>

Manually specify the ITP bug number that this package closes. If not
given, B<dh-make-perl> will try to connect to bugs.debian.org to fetch the
appropriate bug number, using WWW::Mechanize.

=item B<--core-ok>

Allows building core Perl modules. By default, B<dh-make-perl> will not allow
building a module that is shipped as part of the standard Perl library; by
specifying this option, B<dh-make-perl> will build them anyway.

Note that, although it is not probable, this might break unrelated items in
your system - if a newer version of a core module breaks the API, all kinds
of daemons might get upset ;-)

=item B<--cpan> I<MODULE>|I<DIST>

Instructs B<dh-make-perl> to fetch and extract the given CPAN module or
distribution. Works both with C<Foo::Bar> and C<Foo-Bar>.

=item B<--cpan-mirror> I<MIRROR>

Specifies a CPAN site to use as mirror.

=item B<--data-dir> I<DIRECTORY>

Use another data directory, instead of the default, C</usr/share/dh-make-perl>

Data directory is were B<dh-make-perl> looks for its default rules.* templates.
It is similar to B<--home-dir>, but does not change the location of the APT
Contents cache file. If both are given, B<--home-dir> takes precedence.

=item B<--depends> I<DEPENDS>

Manually specify the string to be used for the module's dependencies. This
should be used when building modules where B<dh-make-perl> cannot guess the Perl
dependencies (such as modules built using L<Module::Install>), or when the
Perl code depends on non-Perl binaries or libraries. Usually, B<dh-make-perl>
will figure out the dependencies by itself. If you need to pass B<dh-make-perl>
dependency information, you must do it using the debian package format. i.e.

    dh-make-perl --depends libtest-more-perl

=item B<--desc> I<SHORT DESCRIPTION>

Uses the argument to --desc as short description for the package.

=item B<--dh> I<VERSION>

Set desired debhelper compatibility level. The default is 8 for
architecture-independent packages, and 9 for architecture-dependent packages
(XS).

Since version 0.77, B<dh-make-perl> only supports debhelper compatibility
levels B<< >=8 >>.

See L<debhelper(1)>.

=item B<--dist> I<DISTRIBUTION>

Limit the distributions whose C<Contents> files are parsed. The argument is a distribution name.

Default: empty, meaning no filtering.

Example:
    dh-make-perl --dist etch

=item B<--email> | B<-e> I<EMAIL>

Manually specify the Maintainer email address to use in debian/control and
in debian/changelog.

=item B<--exclude> | B<-i> [I<REGEX>]

This allows you to specify a PCRE to exclude some files from the search for
docs and stuff like that. If no argument is given (but the switch is specified
- not specifying the switch will include everything), it defaults to
dpkg-source's default values.

=item B<--install>

Installs the freshly built package. Specifying --install implies --build - The
package will not be installed unless it was built (obviously ;-) )

=item B<--intrusive>

When determining module dependencies, if L<Module::Depends> fails, tries again
with L<Module::Depends::Intrusive>. M:D:I loads all .pm files, intercepting
loading of other modules, effectively running untrusted code on your behalf.
Use with caution.

=item B<--network>

Enables querying of Debian WNPP lists for ITP and similar bugs. Enabled by
default, use C<--no-network> to disable.

=item B<--notest>

This option for not running the automatic testing of the module as part of
the build script has been removed in 0.54. Please put nocheck in the
DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS environment variable if you want to skip the tests when
building a package.

=item B<--home-dir> I<DIRECTORY>

Where APT Contents and other caches are stored.

Default: ~/.dh-make-perl

=item B<--packagename> | B<-p> I<PACKAGENAME>

Manually specify the Package Name, useful when the module has dashes in its
name.

=item B<--pkg-perl>

Useful when preparing a package for the Debian Perl Group
L<http://pkg-perl.alioth.debian.org>.

Sets C<Maintainer>, C<Uploaders>, C<Vcs-Git> and C<Vcs-Browser> fields in
F<debian/control> accordingly. Also, when C<--vcs git> is used (the default),
sets up a Git remote pointing to the right place on I<git.debian.org>.

=item B<--recursive>

Valid only in L</make> mode with L</--cpan> or I<directory> arguments. Causes
dh-make-perl to try to create packaging (and possibly build and install the
packages if L</--build> and L</--install> options are also given) for any
dependencies which are missing packages.

This works like this: when the 'main' package is constructed, any missing
packages are put in a list, and then the debianisaion procedure is run in turn
on each of them, recursively.

=item B<--requiredeps>

Fail if a dependency Perl package was not found (dependency tracking
requires the apt-file package installed and updated)

=item B<--source-format> I<format>

When creating or refreshing packaging, use the specified source format.
Defaults to C<3.0 (quilt)>.

=item B<--sources-list> I<FILE>

Instruct the C<Contents> file parser to use this B<file> when determining if a
given file should be parsed or not. Contents files not matching any line in
B<sources.list> are not parsed in order to save you time parsing old files from
mirrors you no longer use.

Default: apt's default.

=item B<--vcs> I<VCS>

In B<--pkg-perl> mode, use the specified version control system in the
generated I<Vcs-*> fields. The default is C<git>.

If I<VCS> is C<git>, C<dh-make-perl> will setup a Git repository with three
branches:

=over

=item upstream

The initial branch containing upstream sources

=item master

The branch where packaging is done, forked off C<upstream> and with the
contents of the C<debian/> directory added.

=item pristine-tar

A branch to keep L<pristine-tar(1)> data.

=back

If B<--pkg-perl> is also given, an C<origin> remote is added pointing to the
repository on I<git.debian.org>.

=item B<--verbose> | B<--no-verbose>

Print additional information while processing.

--verbose is on by default in L</make> mode, off otherwise.

=item B<--version> I<VERSION>

Specifies the version of the resulting package.

=back

=head1 FILES

The following directories will be searched to find additional files
required by B<dh-make-perl>:

	/usr/share/dh-make-perl/
	$HOME/.dh-make-perl/

=over 4

=item * dh-make-perl.conf

User configuration. The file is in YAML format. The keys are option names,
as documented in L</OPTIONS> (without leading I<-->).

See the output of C<dh-make-perl --dump-config>, which can also be used for
population of F<dh-make-perl.conf>.

=back

=head1 ENVIRONMENT

HOME - get user's home directory

DEBFULLNAME - get the real name of the maintainer

LOGNAME or USER - get the username

DEBEMAIL or EMAIL - get the email address of the user

=head1 BUGS

Several, let me know when you find them.
