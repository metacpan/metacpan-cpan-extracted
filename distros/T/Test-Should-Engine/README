NAME
    Test::Should::Engine - Should it be OK?

SYNOPSIS
        use Test::Should::Engine;

        Test::Should::Engine->run('should_be_ok', 1);

DESCRIPTION
    Test::Should::Engine is yet another assertion library for Perl5.

    You don't need to use this module directly. This module may include to
    other testing libraries.

    This module is currently under development. API MAY change WITHOUT
    notice.

METHOD
    Test::Should::Engine->run($pattern, $subject, @args);
        This method checks the $subject by $pattern with @args and return
        boolean value.

RULES
    In this section, the code uses Test::Should.

    should_be_ok
            1->should_be_ok()

        Assert truthfulness.

    should_be_empty
            []->should_be_empty()
            ''->should_be_empty()

        On ArrayRef, it doesn't have a elements.

        On String, the length is zero.

    should_be_equal
            [1,2,3]->should_be_equal([1,2,3])

        strict equality.

    should_be_a / should_be_an
            MyObj->new()->should_be_a('MyObj');
            MyObj->new()->should_be_an('ARRAY');

        Checks type.

    should_be_above
            9->should_be_above(4)

        Assert numeric value above the given value.

    should_be_below
            2->should_be_below(4)

        Assert numeric value below the given value.

    should_match
            'hoge'->should_match(qr/h.ge/);

        Assert regexp match.

    should_have_length
            'hoge'->should_have_length(4);
            [1,2,3]->should_have_length(3);

        Assert the length has a value of the given number.

    should_include
            # array
            [1,2,3]->should_include(3)
            [1,2,3]->should_not_include(4)

            # string
            'foo bar baz'.should.include('foo')

        Assert the subject includes a value.

    should_throw
        Assert an exception is thrown:

            (sub { die })->should_throw();

        Assert an exception is not thrown:

            (sub { 1 })->should_not_throw();

        Assert exception message matches regexp:

            (sub { die "Foo" })->should_throw(qr/F/);

    should_not_*
        Invert the result.

USAGE
    You can embed this module to your code by following style :)

    I'll be release this style module named by Test::Should.

    You can see more details in t/01_autobox.t.

        use Test::Should::Engine;
        use Test::More;

        {
            package UNIVERSAL;
            sub DESTROY { }
            our $AUTOLOAD;
            sub AUTOLOAD {
                $AUTOLOAD =~ s/.*:://;
                my $test = Test::Should::Engine->run($AUTOLOAD, @_);
                Test::More->builder->ok($test);
            }
        }

        # and test code
        (bless [], 'Foo')->should_be_ok();
        (bless [], 'Foo')->should_be_a('Foo');
        (bless [], 'Foo')->should_not_be_a('Bar');

        done_testing;

FAQ
    Why do you split a distribution from Test::Should?
        Test::Should depends to autobox. autobox is not needed by some
        users.
