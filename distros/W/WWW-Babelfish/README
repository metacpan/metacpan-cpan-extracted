WWW::Babelfish, version .16

STATUS
======
This is BETA software; use at your own risk. 

Comments, bug reports, patches etc. are appreciated.

DESCRIPTION
===========
This module is a simple perl front-end to the Babelfish, Google or Yahoo
translation servers.  It's more fun than useful, but it might have a
place in IRC/talk clients or perhaps a translating web proxy. It makes
an attempt at breaking longer pieces of text up into chunks that
Babelfish can handle and then reassembling them. 


INSTALLATION
============
This module needs the following modules, all available from CPAN:

HTTP::Request    (in the libwww-perl bundle)
LWP::UserAgent   (in the libwww-perl bundle)
HTML::TokeParser (in the libwww-perl bundle)
IO::String
Encode

After unpacking the tar file, do the usual:

        perl Makefile.PL 
        make
	make test
        make install

There is embedded POD documentation in Babelfish.pm
