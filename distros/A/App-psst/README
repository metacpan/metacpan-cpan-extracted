NAME
    App::psst - prompt string setting tool

VERSION
    version 0.09

DESCRIPTION
    Set-once configuration for ~/.bashrc to show presence of
    $PERL_LOCAL_LIB_ROOT.

  Origin
    I wrote a local::lib-based installer for a small project.

    I added the obligatory "set up the environment and start a shell in
    there" script.

    I wanted the new subshell to be clearly marked as having local::lib
    environment, and decided that this functionality doesn't belong in the
    small project.

  Intentions
    Polish it a little to make a small CPAN-installable package. Install in
    all my $HOMEs.

    Thanks to Magnus Manske for some useful discussion of the mechanism,

    and this post for convincing me that this is a useful route to sanity

    and to my employer for making it easy to mix free software with $work.

  Related tools
    These are tools I have found links to. I have not yet chosen some to
    assemble a better working environment.

    *   Git::CPAN::Hook or CPANPLUS::Dist::GitHook

    *   App::local::lib::helper (App::local::lib::helper::rationale)

        "localenv bash" starts a new shell, which psst can configure.

    *   App::PerlLocalEnv, perl-local-env(1)

        "perl-local-lib $DIR activate" starts a new shell, which psst can
        configure.

    *   App::local::lib::Win32Helper

        This psst has not (yet) been tested with bash under Windows.

    *   App::perlbrew

        This version of psst knows nothing about perlbrew.
