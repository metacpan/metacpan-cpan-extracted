DESCRIPTION
    POE::Component::IRC is a POE component (who'd have guessed?) which acts
    as an easily controllable IRC client for your other POE components and
    sessions. You create an IRC component and tell it what events your
    session cares about and where to connect to, and it sends back
    interesting IRC events when they happen. You make the client do things
    by sending it events. That's all there is to it. Cool, no?

    [Note that using this module requires some familiarity with the details
    of the IRC protocol. I'd advise you to read up on the gory details of
    RFC 1459 (<http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1459.html>) before you get
    started. Keep the list of server numeric codes handy while you program.
    Needless to say, you'll also need a good working knowledge of POE, or
    this document will be of very little use to you.]

    The POE::Component::IRC distribution has a docs/ folder with a
    collection of salient documentation including the pertinent RFCs.

    POE::Component::IRC consists of a POE::Session that manages the IRC
    connection and dispatches "irc_" prefixed events to interested sessions
    and an object that can be used to access additional information using
    methods.

    Sessions register their interest in receiving "irc_" events by sending
    "register" to the component. One would usually do this in your "_start"
    handler. Your session will continue to receive events until you
    "unregister". The component will continue to stay around until you tell
    it not to with "shutdown".

    The SYNOPSIS demonstrates a fairly basic bot.

    See POE::Component::IRC::Cookbook for more examples.

  Useful subclasses
    Included with POE::Component::IRC are a number of useful subclasses. As
    they are subclasses they support all the methods, etc. documented here
    and have additional methods and quirks which are documented separately:

    *   POE::Component::IRC::State

        POE::Component::IRC::State provides all the functionality of
        POE::Component::IRC but also tracks IRC state entities such as nicks
        and channels.

    *   POE::Component::IRC::Qnet

        POE::Component::IRC::Qnet is POE::Component::IRC tweaked for use on
        Quakenet IRC network.

    *   POE::Component::IRC::Qnet::State

        POE::Component::IRC::Qnet::State is a tweaked version of
        POE::Component::IRC::State for use on the Quakenet IRC network.

  The Plugin system
    As of 3.7, PoCo-IRC sports a plugin system. The documentation for it can
    be read by looking at POE::Component::IRC::Plugin. That is not a
    subclass, just a placeholder for documentation!

    A number of useful plugins have made their way into the core
    distribution:

    *   POE::Component::IRC::Plugin::DCC

        Provides DCC support. Loaded by default.

    *   POE::Component::IRC::Plugin::AutoJoin

        Keeps you on your favorite channels throughout reconnects and even
        kicks.

    *   POE::Component::IRC::Plugin::Connector

        Glues an irc bot to an IRC network, i.e. deals with maintaining ircd
        connections.

    *   POE::Component::IRC::Plugin::BotTraffic

        Under normal circumstances irc bots do not normal the msgs and
        public msgs that they generate themselves. This plugin enables you
        to handle those events.

    *   POE::Component::IRC::Plugin::BotAddressed

        Generates "irc_bot_addressed" / "irc_bot_mentioned" /
        "irc_bot_mentioned_action" events whenever your bot's name comes up
        in channel discussion.

    *   POE::Component::IRC::Plugin::BotCommand

        Provides an easy way to handle commands issued to your bot.

    *   POE::Component::IRC::Plugin::Console

        See inside the component. See what events are being sent. Generate
        irc commands manually. A TCP based console.

    *   POE::Component::IRC::Plugin::FollowTail

        Follow the tail of an ever-growing file.

    *   POE::Component::IRC::Plugin::Logger

        Log public and private messages to disk.

    *   POE::Component::IRC::Plugin::NickServID

        Identify with NickServ when needed.

    *   POE::Component::IRC::Plugin::Proxy

        A lightweight IRC proxy/bouncer.

    *   POE::Component::IRC::Plugin::CTCP

        Automagically generates replies to ctcp version, time and userinfo
        queries.

    *   POE::Component::IRC::Plugin::PlugMan

        An experimental Plugin Manager plugin.

    *   POE::Component::IRC::Plugin::NickReclaim

        Automagically deals with your nickname being in use and reclaiming
        it.

    *   POE::Component::IRC::Plugin::CycleEmpty

        Cycles (parts and rejoins) channels if they become empty and opless,
        in order to gain ops.

CONSTRUCTORS
    Both constructors return an object. The object is also available within
    'irc_' event handlers by using "$_[SENDER]->get_heap()". See also
    "register" and "irc_registered".

  "spawn"
    Takes a number of arguments, all of which are optional. All the options
    below may be supplied to the "connect" input event as well, except for
    'alias', 'options', 'NoDNS', 'debug', and 'plugin_debug'.

    *   'alias', a name (kernel alias) that this instance will be known by;

    *   'options', a hashref containing POE::Session options;

    *   'Server', the server name;

    *   'Port', the remote port number;

    *   'Password', an optional password for restricted servers;

    *   'Nick', your client's IRC nickname;

    *   'Username', your client's username;

    *   'Ircname', some cute comment or something.

    *   'Bitmode', an integer representing your initial user modes set in
        the USER command. See RFC 2812. If you do not set this, 8 (+i) will
        be used.

    *   'UseSSL', set to some true value if you want to connect using SSL.

    *   'SSLCert', set to a SSL Certificate(PAM encoded) to connect using a
        client cert

    *   'SSLKey', set to a SSL Key(PAM encoded) to connect using a client
        cert

    *   'SSLCtx', set to a SSL Context to configure the SSL Connection

        The 'SSLCert' and 'SSLKey' both need to be specified. The 'SSLCtx'
        takes precedence specified.

    *   'Raw', set to some true value to enable the component to send
        "irc_raw" and "irc_raw_out" events.

    *   'LocalAddr', which local IP address on a multihomed box to connect
        as;

    *   'LocalPort', the local TCP port to open your socket on;

    *   'NoDNS', set this to 1 to disable DNS lookups using PoCo-Client-DNS.
        (See note below).

    *   'Flood', when true, it disables the component's flood protection
        algorithms, allowing it to send messages to an IRC server at full
        speed. Disconnects and k-lines are some common side effects of
        flooding IRC servers, so care should be used when enabling this
        option. Default is false.

        Two new attributes are 'Proxy' and 'ProxyPort' for sending your
        =item * 'Proxy', IP address or server name of a proxy server to use.

    *   'ProxyPort', which tcp port on the proxy to connect to.

    *   'NATAddr', what other clients see as your IP address.

    *   'DCCPorts', an arrayref containing tcp ports that can be used for
        DCC sends.

    *   'Resolver', provide a POE::Component::Client::DNS object for the
        component to use.

    *   'msg_length', the maximum length of IRC messages, in bytes. Default
        is 450. The IRC component shortens all messages longer than this
        value minus the length of your current nickname. IRC only allows raw
        protocol lines messages that are 512 bytes or shorter, including the
        trailing "\r\n". This is most relevant to long PRIVMSGs. The IRC
        component can't be sure how long your user@host mask will be every
        time you send a message, considering that most networks mangle the
        'user' part and some even replace the whole string (think FreeNode
        cloaks). If you have an unusually long user@host mask you might want
        to decrease this value if you're prone to sending long messages.
        Conversely, if you have an unusually short one, you can increase
        this value if you want to be able to send as long a message as
        possible. Be careful though, increase it too much and the IRC server
        might disconnect you with a "Request too long" message when you try
        to send a message that's too long.

    *   'debug', if set to a true value causes the IRC component to print
        every message sent to and from the server, as well as print some
        warnings when it receives malformed messages. This option will be
        enabled if the "POCOIRC_DEBUG" environment variable is set to a true
        value.

    *   'plugin_debug', set to some true value to print plugin debug info,
        default 0. Plugins are processed inside an eval. When you enable
        this option, you will be notified when (and why) a plugin raises an
        exception. This option will be enabled if the "POCOIRC_DEBUG"
        environment variable is set to a true value.

    *   'socks_proxy', specify a SOCKS4/SOCKS4a proxy to use.

    *   'socks_port', the SOCKS port to use, defaults to 1080 if not
        specified.

    *   'socks_id', specify a SOCKS user_id. Default is none.

    *   'useipv6', enable the use of IPv6 for connections.

    "spawn" will supply reasonable defaults for any of these attributes
    which are missing, so don't feel obliged to write them all out.

    If the component finds that POE::Component::Client::DNS is installed it
    will use that to resolve the server name passed. Disable this behaviour
    if you like, by passing: "NoDNS => 1".

    IRC traffic through a proxy server. 'Proxy''s value should be the IP
    address or server name of the proxy. 'ProxyPort''s value should be the
    port on the proxy to connect to. "connect" will default to using the
    *actual* IRC server's port if you provide a proxy but omit the proxy's
    port. These are for HTTP Proxies. See 'socks_proxy' for SOCKS4 and
    SOCKS4a support.

    For those people who run bots behind firewalls and/or Network Address
    Translation there are two additional attributes for DCC. 'DCCPorts', is
    an arrayref of ports to use when initiating DCC connections. 'NATAddr',
    is the NAT'ed IP address that your bot is hidden behind, this is sent
    whenever you do DCC.

    SSL support requires POE::Component::SSLify, as well as an IRC server
    that supports SSL connections. If you're missing POE::Component::SSLify,
    specifying 'UseSSL' will do nothing. The default is to not try to use
    SSL.

    'Resolver', requires a POE::Component::Client::DNS object. Useful when
    spawning multiple poco-irc sessions, saves the overhead of multiple dns
    sessions.

    'NoDNS' has different results depending on whether it is set with
    "spawn" or "connect". Setting it with "spawn", disables the creation of
    the POE::Component::Client::DNS completely. Setting it with "connect" on
    the other hand allows the PoCo-Client-DNS session to be spawned, but
    will disable any dns lookups using it.

    SOCKS4 proxy support is provided by 'socks_proxy', 'socks_port' and
    'socks_id' parameters. If something goes wrong with the SOCKS connection
    you should get a warning on STDERR. This is fairly experimental
    currently.

    IPv6 support is available for connecting to IPv6 enabled ircds (it won't
    work for DCC though). To enable it, specify 'useipv6'. Perl >=5.14 or
    Socket6 (for older Perls) is required. If you that and
    POE::Component::Client::DNS installed and specify a hostname that
    resolves to an IPv6 address then IPv6 will be used. If you specify an
    ipv6 'localaddr' then IPv6 will be used.

  "new"
    This method is deprecated. See the "spawn" method instead. The first
    argument should be a name (kernel alias) which this new connection will
    be known by. Optionally takes more arguments (see "spawn" as name/value
    pairs. Returns a POE::Component::IRC object. :)

    Note: Use of this method will generate a warning. There are currently no
    plans to make it die() >;]

METHODS
  Information
   "server"
    Takes no arguments. Returns the server host we are currently connected
    to (or trying to connect to).

   "port"
    Takes no arguments. Returns the server port we are currently connected
    to (or trying to connect to).

   "server_name"
    Takes no arguments. Returns the name of the IRC server that the
    component is currently connected to.

   "server_version"

   "logged_in"
    Takes no arguments. Returns true or false depending on whether the IRC
    component is logged into an IRC network.

   "connected"
    Takes no arguments. Returns true or false depending on whether the
    component's socket is currently connected.

   "disconnect"
    Takes no arguments. Terminates the socket connection disgracefully >;o]

   "isupport"
    Takes one argument, a server capability to query. Returns "undef" on
    failure or a value representing the applicable capability. A full list
    of capabilities is available at <http://www.irc.org/tech_docs/005.html>.

   "isupport_dump_keys"
    Takes no arguments, returns a list of the available server capabilities
    keys, which can be used with "isupport".

   "resolver"
    Returns a reference to the POE::Component::Client::DNS object that is
    internally created by the component.

  Events
   "session_id"
    *Inherited from POE::Component::Syndicator*

    Takes no arguments. Returns the ID of the component's session. Ideal for
    posting events to the component.

     $kernel->post($irc->session_id() => 'mode' => $channel => '+o' => $dude);

   "session_alias"
    *Inherited from POE::Component::Syndicator*

    Takes no arguments. Returns the session alias that has been set through
    "spawn"'s 'alias' argument.

   "raw_events"
    With no arguments, returns true or false depending on whether "irc_raw"
    and "irc_raw_out" events are being generated or not. Provide a true or
    false argument to enable or disable this feature accordingly.

   "yield"
    *Inherited from POE::Component::Syndicator*

    This method provides an alternative object based means of posting events
    to the component. First argument is the event to post, following
    arguments are sent as arguments to the resultant post.

     $irc->yield(mode => $channel => '+o' => $dude);

   "call"
    *Inherited from POE::Component::Syndicator*

    This method provides an alternative object based means of calling events
    to the component. First argument is the event to call, following
    arguments are sent as arguments to the resultant call.

     $irc->call(mode => $channel => '+o' => $dude);

   "delay"
    *Inherited from POE::Component::Syndicator*

    This method provides a way of posting delayed events to the component.
    The first argument is an arrayref consisting of the delayed command to
    post and any command arguments. The second argument is the time in
    seconds that one wishes to delay the command being posted.

     my $alarm_id = $irc->delay( [ mode => $channel => '+o' => $dude ], 60 );

    Returns an alarm ID that can be used with "delay_remove" to cancel the
    delayed event. This will be undefined if something went wrong.

   "delay_remove"
    *Inherited from POE::Component::Syndicator*

    This method removes a previously scheduled delayed event from the
    component. Takes one argument, the "alarm_id" that was returned by a
    "delay" method call.

     my $arrayref = $irc->delay_remove( $alarm_id );

    Returns an arrayref that was originally requested to be delayed.

   "send_event"
    *Inherited from POE::Component::Syndicator*

    Sends an event through the component's event handling system. These will
    get processed by plugins then by registered sessions. First argument is
    the event name, followed by any parameters for that event.

   "send_event_next"
    *Inherited from POE::Component::Syndicator*

    This sends an event right after the one that's currently being
    processed. Useful if you want to generate some event which is directly
    related to another event so you want them to appear together. This
    method can only be called when POE::Component::IRC is processing an
    event, e.g. from one of your event handlers. Takes the same arguments as
    "send_event".

   "send_event_now"
    *Inherited from POE::Component::Syndicator*

    This will send an event to be processed immediately. This means that if
    an event is currently being processed and there are plugins or sessions
    which will receive it after you do, then an event sent with
    "send_event_now" will be received by those plugins/sessions *before* the
    current event. Takes the same arguments as "send_event".

  Plugins
   "pipeline"
    *Inherited from Object::Pluggable*

    Returns the Object::Pluggable::Pipeline object.

   "plugin_add"
    *Inherited from Object::Pluggable*

    Accepts two arguments:

     The alias for the plugin
     The actual plugin object
     Any number of extra arguments

    The alias is there for the user to refer to it, as it is possible to
    have multiple plugins of the same kind active in one Object::Pluggable
    object.

    This method goes through the pipeline's "push()" method, which will call
    "$plugin->plugin_register($pluggable, @args)".

    Returns the number of plugins now in the pipeline if plugin was
    initialized, "undef"/an empty list if not.

   "plugin_del"
    *Inherited from Object::Pluggable*

    Accepts the following arguments:

     The alias for the plugin or the plugin object itself
     Any number of extra arguments

    This method goes through the pipeline's "remove()" method, which will
    call "$plugin->plugin_unregister($pluggable, @args)".

    Returns the plugin object if the plugin was removed, "undef"/an empty
    list if not.

   "plugin_get"
    *Inherited from Object::Pluggable*

    Accepts the following arguments:

     The alias for the plugin

    This method goes through the pipeline's "get()" method.

    Returns the plugin object if it was found, "undef"/an empty list if not.

   "plugin_list"
    *Inherited from Object::Pluggable*

    Takes no arguments.

    Returns a hashref of plugin objects, keyed on alias, or an empty list if
    there are no plugins loaded.

   "plugin_order"
    *Inherited from Object::Pluggable*

    Takes no arguments.

    Returns an arrayref of plugin objects, in the order which they are
    encountered in the pipeline.

   "plugin_register"
    *Inherited from Object::Pluggable*

    Accepts the following arguments:

     The plugin object
     The type of the hook (the hook types are specified with _pluggable_init()'s 'types')
     The event name[s] to watch

    The event names can be as many as possible, or an arrayref. They
    correspond to the prefixed events and naturally, arbitrary events too.

    You do not need to supply events with the prefix in front of them, just
    the names.

    It is possible to register for all events by specifying 'all' as an
    event.

    Returns 1 if everything checked out fine, "undef"/an empty list if
    something is seriously wrong.

   "plugin_unregister"
    *Inherited from Object::Pluggable*

    Accepts the following arguments:

     The plugin object
     The type of the hook (the hook types are specified with _pluggable_init()'s 'types')
     The event name[s] to unwatch

    The event names can be as many as possible, or an arrayref. They
    correspond to the prefixed events and naturally, arbitrary events too.

    You do not need to supply events with the prefix in front of them, just
    the names.

    It is possible to register for all events by specifying 'all' as an
    event.

    Returns 1 if all the event name[s] was unregistered, undef if some was
    not found.

INPUT EVENTS
    How to talk to your new IRC component... here's the events we'll accept.
    These are events that are posted to the component, either via
    "$poe_kernel->post()" or via the object method "yield".

    So the following would be functionally equivalent:

     sub irc_001 {
         my ($kernel,$sender) = @_[KERNEL,SENDER];
         my $irc = $sender->get_heap(); # obtain the poco's object

         $irc->yield( privmsg => 'foo' => 'Howdy!' );
         $kernel->post( $sender => privmsg => 'foo' => 'Howdy!' );
         $kernel->post( $irc->session_id() => privmsg => 'foo' => 'Howdy!' );
         $kernel->post( $irc->session_alias() => privmsg => 'foo' => 'Howdy!' );

         return;
     }

  Important Commands
   "register"
    *Inherited from POE::Component::Syndicator*

    Takes N arguments: a list of event names that your session wants to
    listen for, minus the "irc_" prefix. So, for instance, if you just want
    a bot that keeps track of which people are on a channel, you'll need to
    listen for JOINs, PARTs, QUITs, and KICKs to people on the channel
    you're in. You'd tell POE::Component::IRC that you want those events by
    saying this:

     $kernel->post('my client', 'register', qw(join part quit kick));

    Then, whenever people enter or leave a channel your bot is on (forcibly
    or not), your session will receive events with names like "irc_join",
    "irc_kick", etc., which you can use to update a list of people on the
    channel.

    Registering for 'all' will cause it to send all IRC-related events to
    you; this is the easiest way to handle it. See the test script for an
    example.

    Registering will generate an "irc_registered" event that your session
    can trap. "ARG0" is the components object. Useful if you want to bolt
    PoCo-IRC's new features such as Plugins into a bot coded to the older
    deprecated API. If you are using the new API, ignore this :)

    Registering with multiple component sessions can be tricky, especially
    if one wants to marry up sessions/objects, etc. Check the SIGNALS
    section for an alternative method of registering with multiple
    poco-ircs.

    Starting with version 4.96, if you spawn the component from inside
    another POE session, the component will automatically register that
    session as wanting 'all' irc events. That session will receive an
    "irc_registered" event indicating that the component is up and ready to
    go.

   "unregister"
    *Inherited from POE::Component::Syndicator*

    Takes N arguments: a list of event names which you *don't* want to
    receive. If you've previously done a "register" for a particular event
    which you no longer care about, this event will tell the IRC connection
    to stop sending them to you. (If you haven't, it just ignores you. No
    big deal.)

    If you have registered with 'all', attempting to unregister individual
    events such as 'mode', etc. will not work. This is a 'feature'.

   "connect"
    Takes one argument: a hash reference of attributes for the new
    connection, see "spawn" for details. This event tells the IRC client to
    connect to a new/different server. If it has a connection already open,
    it'll close it gracefully before reconnecting.

   "ctcp" and "ctcpreply"
    Sends a CTCP query or response to the nick(s) or channel(s) which you
    specify. Takes 2 arguments: the nick or channel to send a message to
    (use an array reference here to specify multiple recipients), and the
    plain text of the message to send (the CTCP quoting will be handled for
    you). The "/me" command in popular IRC clients is actually a CTCP
    action.

     # Doing a /me
     $irc->yield(ctcp => $channel => 'ACTION dances.');

   "join"
    Tells your IRC client to join a single channel of your choice. Takes at
    least one arg: the channel name (required) and the channel key
    (optional, for password-protected channels).

   "kick"
    Tell the IRC server to forcibly evict a user from a particular channel.
    Takes at least 2 arguments: a channel name, the nick of the user to
    boot, and an optional witty message to show them as they sail out the
    door.

   "remove"
    Tell the IRC server to forcibly evict a user from a particular channel.
    Takes at least 2 arguments: a channel name, the nick of the user to
    boot, and an optional witty message to show them as they sail out the
    door. Similar to KICK but does an enforced PART instead. Not supported
    by all servers.

   "mode"
    Request a mode change on a particular channel or user. Takes at least
    one argument: the mode changes to effect, as a single string (e.g.
    "#mychan +sm-p+o"), and any number of optional operands to the mode
    changes (nicks, hostmasks, channel keys, whatever.) Or just pass them
    all as one big string and it'll still work, whatever. I regret that I
    haven't the patience now to write a detailed explanation, but serious
    IRC users know the details anyhow.

   "nick"
    Allows you to change your nickname. Takes exactly one argument: the new
    username that you'd like to be known as.

   "nickserv"
    Talks to NickServ, on networks which have it. Takes any number of
    arguments.

   "notice"
    Sends a NOTICE message to the nick(s) or channel(s) which you specify.
    Takes 2 arguments: the nick or channel to send a notice to (use an array
    reference here to specify multiple recipients), and the text of the
    notice to send.

   "part"
    Tell your IRC client to leave the channels which you pass to it. Takes
    any number of arguments: channel names to depart from. If the last
    argument doesn't begin with a channel name identifier or contains a
    space character, it will be treated as a PART message and dealt with
    accordingly.

   "privmsg"
    Sends a public or private message to the nick(s) or channel(s) which you
    specify. Takes 2 arguments: the nick or channel to send a message to
    (use an array reference here to specify multiple recipients), and the
    text of the message to send.

    Have a look at the constants in IRC::Utils if you would like to use
    formatting and color codes in your messages.

     $irc->yield('primvsg', '#mychannel', 'Hello there');

     # same, but with a green Hello
     use IRC::Utils qw(GREEN NORMAL);
     $irc->yield('primvsg', '#mychannel', GREEN.'Hello'.NORMAL.' there');

   "quit"
    Tells the IRC server to disconnect you. Takes one optional argument:
    some clever, witty string that other users in your channels will see as
    you leave. You can expect to get an "irc_disconnected" event shortly
    after sending this.

   "shutdown"
    By default, POE::Component::IRC sessions never go away. Even after
    they're disconnected, they're still sitting around in the background,
    waiting for you to call "connect" on them again to reconnect. (Whether
    this behavior is the Right Thing is doubtful, but I don't want to break
    backwards compatibility at this point.) You can send the IRC session a
    "shutdown" event manually to make it delete itself.

    If you are logged into an IRC server, "shutdown" first will send a quit
    message and wait to be disconnected. It will wait for up to 5 seconds
    before forcibly disconnecting from the IRC server. If you provide an
    argument, that will be used as the QUIT message. If you provide two
    arguments, the second one will be used as the timeout (in seconds).

    Terminating multiple components can be tricky. Check the SIGNALS section
    for a method of shutting down multiple poco-ircs.

   "topic"
    Retrieves or sets the topic for particular channel. If called with just
    the channel name as an argument, it will ask the server to return the
    current topic. If called with the channel name and a string, it will set
    the channel topic to that string. Supply an empty string to unset a
    channel topic.

   "debug"
    Takes one argument: 0 to turn debugging off or 1 to turn debugging on.
    This flips the debugging flag in POE::Filter::IRCD,
    POE::Filter::IRC::Compat, and POE::Component::IRC. This has the same
    effect as setting Debug in "spawn" or "connect".

  Not-So-Important Commands
   "admin"
    Asks your server who your friendly neighborhood server administrators
    are. If you prefer, you can pass it a server name to query, instead of
    asking the server you're currently on.

   "away"
    When sent with an argument (a message describig where you went), the
    server will note that you're now away from your machine or otherwise
    preoccupied, and pass your message along to anyone who tries to
    communicate with you. When sent without arguments, it tells the server
    that you're back and paying attention.

   "cap"
    Used to query/enable/disable IRC protocol capabilities. Takes any number
    of arguments.

   "dcc*"
    See the DCC plugin (loaded by default) documentation for DCC-related
    commands.

   "info"
    Basically the same as the "version" command, except that the server is
    permitted to return any information about itself that it thinks is
    relevant. There's some nice, specific standards-writing for ya, eh?

   "invite"
    Invites another user onto an invite-only channel. Takes 2 arguments: the
    nick of the user you wish to admit, and the name of the channel to
    invite them to.

   "ison"
    Asks the IRC server which users out of a list of nicknames are currently
    online. Takes any number of arguments: a list of nicknames to query the
    IRC server about.

   "links"
    Asks the server for a list of servers connected to the IRC network.
    Takes two optional arguments, which I'm too lazy to document here, so
    all you would-be linklooker writers should probably go dig up the RFC.

   "list"
    Asks the server for a list of visible channels and their topics. Takes
    any number of optional arguments: names of channels to get topic
    information for. If called without any channel names, it'll list every
    visible channel on the IRC network. This is usually a really big list,
    so don't do this often.

   "motd"
    Request the server's "Message of the Day", a document which typically
    contains stuff like the server's acceptable use policy and admin contact
    email addresses, et cetera. Normally you'll automatically receive this
    when you log into a server, but if you want it again, here's how to do
    it. If you'd like to get the MOTD for a server other than the one you're
    logged into, pass it the server's hostname as an argument; otherwise, no
    arguments.

   "names"
    Asks the server for a list of nicknames on particular channels. Takes
    any number of arguments: names of channels to get lists of users for. If
    called without any channel names, it'll tell you the nicks of everyone
    on the IRC network. This is a really big list, so don't do this much.

   "quote"
    Sends a raw line of text to the server. Takes one argument: a string of
    a raw IRC command to send to the server. It is more optimal to use the
    events this module supplies instead of writing raw IRC commands
    yourself.

   "stats"
    Returns some information about a server. Kinda complicated and not
    terribly commonly used, so look it up in the RFC if you're curious.
    Takes as many arguments as you please.

   "time"
    Asks the server what time it thinks it is, which it will return in a
    human-readable form. Takes one optional argument: a server name to
    query. If not supplied, defaults to current server.

   "trace"
    If you pass a server name or nick along with this request, it asks the
    server for the list of servers in between you and the thing you
    mentioned. If sent with no arguments, it will show you all the servers
    which are connected to your current server.

   "users"
    Asks the server how many users are logged into it. Defaults to the
    server you're currently logged into; however, you can pass a server name
    as the first argument to query some other machine instead.

   "version"
    Asks the server about the version of ircd that it's running. Takes one
    optional argument: a server name to query. If not supplied, defaults to
    current server.

   "who"
    Lists the logged-on users matching a particular channel name, hostname,
    nickname, or what-have-you. Takes one optional argument: a string for it
    to search for. Wildcards are allowed; in the absence of this argument,
    it will return everyone who's currently logged in (bad move). Tack an
    "o" on the end if you want to list only IRCops, as per the RFC.

   "whois"
    Queries the IRC server for detailed information about a particular user.
    Takes any number of arguments: nicknames or hostmasks to ask for
    information about. As of version 3.2, you will receive an "irc_whois"
    event in addition to the usual numeric responses. See below for details.

   "whowas"
    Asks the server for information about nickname which is no longer
    connected. Takes at least one argument: a nickname to look up (no
    wildcards allowed), the optional maximum number of history entries to
    return, and the optional server hostname to query. As of version 3.2,
    you will receive an "irc_whowas" event in addition to the usual numeric
    responses. See below for details.

   "ping" and "pong"
    Included for completeness sake. The component will deal with ponging to
    pings automatically. Don't worry about it.

  Purely Esoteric Commands
   "die"
    Tells the IRC server you're connect to, to terminate. Only useful for
    IRCops, thank goodness. Takes no arguments.

   "locops"
    Opers-only command. This one sends a message to all currently logged-on
    local-opers (+l). This option is specific to EFNet.

   "oper"
    In the exceedingly unlikely event that you happen to be an IRC operator,
    you can use this command to authenticate with your IRC server. Takes 2
    arguments: your username and your password.

   "operwall"
    Opers-only command. This one sends a message to all currently logged-on
    global opers. This option is specific to EFNet.

   "rehash"
    Tells the IRC server you're connected to, to rehash its configuration
    files. Only useful for IRCops. Takes no arguments.

   "restart"
    Tells the IRC server you're connected to, to shut down and restart
    itself. Only useful for IRCops, thank goodness. Takes no arguments.

   "sconnect"
    Tells one IRC server (which you have operator status on) to connect to
    another. This is actually the CONNECT command, but I already had an
    event called "connect", so too bad. Takes the args you'd expect: a
    server to connect to, an optional port to connect on, and an optional
    remote server to connect with, instead of the one you're currently on.

   "squit"
    Operator-only command used to disconnect server links. Takes two
    arguments, the server to disconnect and a message explaining your
    action.

   "summon"
    Don't even ask.

   "servlist"
    Lists the currently connected services on the network that are visible
    to you. Takes two optional arguments, a mask for matching service names
    against, and a service type.

   "squery"
    Sends a message to a service. Takes the same arguments as "privmsg".

   "userhost"
    Asks the IRC server for information about particular nicknames. (The RFC
    doesn't define exactly what this is supposed to return.) Takes any
    number of arguments: the nicknames to look up.

   "wallops"
    Another opers-only command. This one sends a message to all currently
    logged-on opers (and +w users); sort of a mass PA system for the IRC
    server administrators. Takes one argument: some clever, witty message to
    send.

OUTPUT EVENTS
    The events you will receive (or can ask to receive) from your running
    IRC component. Note that all incoming event names your session will
    receive are prefixed by "irc_", to inhibit event namespace pollution.

    If you wish, you can ask the client to send you every event it
    generates. Simply register for the event name "all". This is a lot
    easier than writing a huge list of things you specifically want to
    listen for.

    FIXME: I'd really like to classify these somewhat ("basic", "oper",
    "ctcp", "dcc", "raw" or some such), and I'd welcome suggestions for ways
    to make this easier on the user, if you can think of some.

    In your event handlers, $_[SENDER] is the particular component session
    that sent you the event. "$_[SENDER]->get_heap()" will retrieve the
    component's object. Useful if you want on-the-fly access to the object
    and its methods.

  Important Events
   "irc_registered"
    *Inherited from POE::Component::Syndicator*

    Sent once to the requesting session on registration (see "register").
    "ARG0" is a reference tothe component's object.

   "irc_shutdown"
    *Inherited from POE::Component::Syndicator*

    Sent to all registered sessions when the component has been asked to
    "shutdown". "ARG0" will be the session ID of the requesting session.

   "irc_connected"
    The IRC component will send an "irc_connected" event as soon as it
    establishes a connection to an IRC server, before attempting to log in.
    "ARG0" is the server name.

    NOTE: When you get an "irc_connected" event, this doesn't mean you can
    start sending commands to the server yet. Wait until you receive an
    "irc_001" event (the server welcome message) before actually sending
    anything back to the server.

   "irc_ctcp"
    "irc_ctcp" events are generated upon receipt of CTCP messages, in
    addition to the "irc_ctcp_*" events mentioned below. They are identical
    in every way to these, with one difference: instead of the * being in
    the method name, it is prepended to the argument list. For example, if
    someone types "/ctcp Flibble foo bar", an "irc_ctcp" event will be sent
    with 'foo' as "ARG0", and the rest as given below.

    It is not recommended that you register for both "irc_ctcp" and
    "irc_ctcp_*" events, since they will both be fired and presumably cause
    duplication.

   "irc_ctcp_*"
    "irc_ctcp_whatever" events are generated upon receipt of CTCP messages.
    For instance, receiving a CTCP PING request generates an "irc_ctcp_ping"
    event, CTCP ACTION (produced by typing "/me" in most IRC clients)
    generates an "irc_ctcp_action" event, blah blah, so on and so forth.
    "ARG0" is the nick!hostmask of the sender. "ARG1" is the
    channel/recipient name(s). "ARG2" is the text of the CTCP message. On
    servers supporting the IDENTIFY-MSG feature (e.g. FreeNode), CTCP
    ACTIONs will have "ARG3", which will be 1 if the sender has identified
    with NickServ, 0 otherwise.

    Note that DCCs are handled separately -- see the DCC plugin.

   "irc_ctcpreply_*"
    "irc_ctcpreply_whatever" messages are just like "irc_ctcp_whatever"
    messages, described above, except that they're generated when a response
    to one of your CTCP queries comes back. They have the same arguments and
    such as "irc_ctcp_*" events.

   "irc_disconnected"
    The counterpart to "irc_connected", sent whenever a socket connection to
    an IRC server closes down (whether intentionally or unintentionally).
    "ARG0" is the server name.

   "irc_error"
    You get this whenever the server sends you an ERROR message. Expect this
    to usually be accompanied by the sudden dropping of your connection.
    "ARG0" is the server's explanation of the error.

   "irc_join"
    Sent whenever someone joins a channel that you're on. "ARG0" is the
    person's nick!hostmask. "ARG1" is the channel name.

   "irc_invite"
    Sent whenever someone offers you an invitation to another channel.
    "ARG0" is the person's nick!hostmask. "ARG1" is the name of the channel
    they want you to join.

   "irc_kick"
    Sent whenever someone gets booted off a channel that you're on. "ARG0"
    is the kicker's nick!hostmask. "ARG1" is the channel name. "ARG2" is the
    nick of the unfortunate kickee. "ARG3" is the explanation string for the
    kick.

   "irc_mode"
    Sent whenever someone changes a channel mode in your presence, or when
    you change your own user mode. "ARG0" is the nick!hostmask of that
    someone. "ARG1" is the channel it affects (or your nick, if it's a user
    mode change). "ARG2" is the mode string (i.e., "+o-b"). The rest of the
    args ("ARG3 .. $#_") are the operands to the mode string (nicks,
    hostmasks, channel keys, whatever).

   "irc_msg"
    Sent whenever you receive a PRIVMSG command that was addressed to you
    privately. "ARG0" is the nick!hostmask of the sender. "ARG1" is an array
    reference containing the nick(s) of the recipients. "ARG2" is the text
    of the message. On servers supporting the IDENTIFY-MSG feature (e.g.
    FreeNode), there will be an additional argument, "ARG3", which will be 1
    if the sender has identified with NickServ, 0 otherwise.

   "irc_nick"
    Sent whenever you, or someone around you, changes nicks. "ARG0" is the
    nick!hostmask of the changer. "ARG1" is the new nick that they changed
    to.

   "irc_notice"
    Sent whenever you receive a NOTICE command. "ARG0" is the nick!hostmask
    of the sender. "ARG1" is an array reference containing the nick(s) or
    channel name(s) of the recipients. "ARG2" is the text of the NOTICE
    message.

   "irc_part"
    Sent whenever someone leaves a channel that you're on. "ARG0" is the
    person's nick!hostmask. "ARG1" is the channel name. "ARG2" is the part
    message.

   "irc_public"
    Sent whenever you receive a PRIVMSG command that was sent to a channel.
    "ARG0" is the nick!hostmask of the sender. "ARG1" is an array reference
    containing the channel name(s) of the recipients. "ARG2" is the text of
    the message. On servers supporting the IDENTIFY-MSG feature (e.g.
    FreeNode), there will be an additional argument, "ARG3", which will be 1
    if the sender has identified with NickServ, 0 otherwise.

   "irc_quit"
    Sent whenever someone on a channel with you quits IRC (or gets KILLed).
    "ARG0" is the nick!hostmask of the person in question. "ARG1" is the
    clever, witty message they left behind on the way out.

   "irc_socketerr"
    Sent when a connection couldn't be established to the IRC server. "ARG0"
    is probably some vague and/or misleading reason for what failed.

   "irc_topic"
    Sent when a channel topic is set or unset. "ARG0" is the nick!hostmask
    of the sender. "ARG1" is the channel affected. "ARG2" will be either: a
    string if the topic is being set; or a zero-length string (i.e. '') if
    the topic is being unset. Note: replies to queries about what a channel
    topic *is* (i.e. TOPIC #channel), are returned as numerics, not with
    this event.

   "irc_whois"
    Sent in response to a WHOIS query. "ARG0" is a hashref, with the
    following keys:

    *   'nick', the users nickname;

    *   'user', the users username;

    *   'host', their hostname;

    *   'real', their real name;

    *   'idle', their idle time in seconds;

    *   'signon', the epoch time they signed on (will be undef if ircd does
        not support this);

    *   'channels', an arrayref listing visible channels they are on, the
        channel is prefixed with '@','+','%' depending on whether they have
        +o +v or +h;

    *   'server', their server (might not be useful on some networks);

    *   'oper', whether they are an IRCop, contains the IRC operator string
        if they are, undef if they aren't.

    *   'actually', some ircds report the user's actual ip address, that'll
        be here;

    *   'identified'. if the user has identified with NICKSERV (ircu, seven,
        Plexus)

    *   'modes', a string describing the user's modes (Rizon)

   "irc_whowas"
    Similar to the above, except some keys will be missing.

   "irc_raw"
    Enabled by passing "Raw => 1" to "spawn" or "connect", or by calling
    "raw_events" with a true argument. "ARG0" is the raw IRC string received
    by the component from the IRC server, before it has been mangled by
    filters and such like.

   "irc_raw_out"
    Enabled by passing "Raw => 1" to "spawn" or "connect", or by calling
    "raw_events" with a true argument. "ARG0" is the raw IRC string sent by
    the component to the the IRC server.

   "irc_isupport"
    Emitted by the first event after an "irc_005", to indicate that isupport
    information has been gathered. "ARG0" is the
    POE::Component::IRC::Plugin::ISupport object.

   "irc_socks_failed"
    Emitted whenever we fail to connect successfully to a SOCKS server or
    the SOCKS server is not actually a SOCKS server. "ARG0" will be some
    vague reason as to what went wrong. Hopefully.

   "irc_socks_rejected"
    Emitted whenever a SOCKS connection is rejected by a SOCKS server.
    "ARG0" is the SOCKS code, "ARG1" the SOCKS server address, "ARG2" the
    SOCKS port and "ARG3" the SOCKS user id (if defined).

   "irc_plugin_add"
    *Inherited from Object::Pluggable*

    Emitted whenever a new plugin is added to the pipeline. "ARG0" is the
    plugin alias. "ARG1" is the plugin object.

   "irc_plugin_del"
    *Inherited from Object::Pluggable*

    Emitted whenever a plugin is removed from the pipeline. "ARG0" is the
    plugin alias. "ARG1" is the plugin object.

   "irc_plugin_error"
    *Inherited from Object::Pluggable*

    Emitted when an error occurs while executing a plugin handler. "ARG0" is
    the error message. "ARG1" is the plugin alias. "ARG2" is the plugin
    object.

  Somewhat Less Important Events
   "irc_cap"
    A reply from the server regarding protocol capabilities. "ARG0" is the
    CAP subcommand (e.g. 'LS'). "ARG1" is the result of the subcommand,
    unless this is a multi-part reply, in which case "ARG1" is '*' and
    "ARG2" contains the result.

   "irc_dcc_*"
    See the DCC plugin (loaded by default) documentation for DCC-related
    events.

   "irc_ping"
    An event sent whenever the server sends a PING query to the client.
    (Don't confuse this with a CTCP PING, which is another beast entirely.
    If unclear, read the RFC.) Note that POE::Component::IRC will
    automatically take care of sending the PONG response back to the server
    for you, although you can still register to catch the event for
    informational purposes.

   "irc_snotice"
    A weird, non-RFC-compliant message from an IRC server. Usually sent
    during to you during an authentication phase right after you connect,
    while the server does a hostname lookup or similar tasks. "ARG0" is the
    text of the server's message. "ARG1" is the target, which could be '*'
    or 'AUTH' or whatever. Servers vary as to whether these notices include
    a server name as the sender, or no sender at all. "ARG1" is the sender,
    if any.

   "irc_delay_set"
    *Inherited from POE::Component::Syndicator*

    Emitted on a successful addition of a delayed event using the "delay"
    method. "ARG0" will be the alarm_id which can be used later with
    "delay_remove". Subsequent parameters are the arguments that were passed
    to "delay".

   "irc_delay_removed"
    *Inherited from POE::Component::Syndicator*

    Emitted when a delayed command is successfully removed. "ARG0" will be
    the alarm_id that was removed. Subsequent parameters are the arguments
    that were passed to "delay".

  All numeric events
    Most messages from IRC servers are identified only by three-digit
    numeric codes with undescriptive constant names like RPL_UMODEIS and
    ERR_NOTOPLEVEL. (Actually, the list of codes in the RFC is kind of
    out-of-date... the list in the back of Net::IRC::Event.pm is more
    complete, and different IRC networks have different and incompatible
    lists. Ack!) As an example, say you wanted to handle event 376
    (RPL_ENDOFMOTD, which signals the end of the MOTD message). You'd
    register for '376', and listen for "irc_376" events. Simple, no? "ARG0"
    is the name of the server which sent the message. "ARG1" is the text of
    the message. "ARG2" is an array reference of the parsed message, so
    there is no need to parse "ARG1" yourself.

SIGNALS
    The component will handle a number of custom signals that you may send
    using POE::Kernel's "signal" method.

  "POCOIRC_REGISTER"
    *Inherited from POE::Component::Syndicator*

    Registering with multiple PoCo-IRC components has been a pita. Well, no
    more, using the power of POE::Kernel signals.

    If the component receives a "POCOIRC_REGISTER" signal it'll register the
    requesting session and trigger an "irc_registered" event. From that
    event one can get all the information necessary such as the poco-irc
    object and the SENDER session to do whatever one needs to build a
    poco-irc dispatch table.

    The way the signal handler in PoCo-IRC is written also supports sending
    the "POCOIRC_REGISTER" to multiple sessions simultaneously, by sending
    the signal to the POE Kernel itself.

    Pass the signal your session, session ID or alias, and the IRC events
    (as specified to "register").

    To register with multiple PoCo-IRCs one can do the following in your
    session's _start handler:

     sub _start {
         my ($kernel, $session) = @_[KERNEL, SESSION];

         # Registering with multiple pocoircs for 'all' IRC events
         $kernel->signal($kernel, 'POCOIRC_REGISTER', $session->ID(), 'all');

         return:
     }

    Each poco-irc will send your session an "irc_registered" event:

     sub irc_registered {
         my ($kernel, $sender, $heap, $irc_object) = @_[KERNEL, SENDER, HEAP, ARG0];

         # Get the poco-irc session ID
         my $sender_id = $sender->ID();

         # Or it's alias
         my $poco_alias = $irc_object->session_alias();

         # Store it in our heap maybe
         $heap->{irc_objects}->{ $sender_id } = $irc_object;

         # Make the poco connect
         $irc_object->yield(connect => { });

         return;
     }

  "POCOIRC_SHUTDOWN"
    *Inherited from POE::Component::Syndicator*

    Telling multiple poco-ircs to shutdown was a pita as well. The same
    principle as with registering applies to shutdown too.

    Send a "POCOIRC_SHUTDOWN" to the POE Kernel to terminate all the active
    poco-ircs simultaneously.

     $poe_kernel->signal($poe_kernel, 'POCOIRC_SHUTDOWN');

    Any additional parameters passed to the signal will become your quit
    messages on each IRC network.

ENCODING
    This can be an issue. Take a look at IRC::Utils' section on it.

MAD PROPS
    The maddest of mad props go out to Rocco "dngor" Caputo
    <troc@netrus.net>, for inventing something as mind-bogglingly cool as
    POE, and to Kevin "oznoid" Lenzo <lenzo@cs.cmu.edu>, for being the
    attentive parent of our precocious little infobot on #perl.

    Further props to a few of the studly bughunters who made this module not
    suck: Abys <abys@web1-2-3.com>, Addi <addi@umich.edu>, ResDev
    <ben@reser.org>, and Roderick <roderick@argon.org>. Woohoo!

    Kudos to Apocalypse, <apocal@cpan.org>, for the plugin system and to
    Jeff 'japhy' Pinyan, <japhy@perlmonk.org>, for Pipeline.

    Thanks to the merry band of POE pixies from #PoE @ irc.perl.org,
