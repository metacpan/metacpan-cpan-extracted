Parallel-Fork-BossWorkerAsync version 0.03
==========================================

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

There is an extra test that's not in the MANIFEST, called t/large_return.t. You may wish
to include it. The reason it's not part of the default build is that on BSD systems it
takes well over five minutes to execute (9 minutes on Darwin 12.4.0 Mountain Lion). The
problem is the 8k limit on 
the socket read buffer, enforced by the OS. It's only an issue on BSD, and if you're
passing megabyte chunks of data between processes. More details in the man page.

To avoid the test, simply move t/large_return.t to another directory.
