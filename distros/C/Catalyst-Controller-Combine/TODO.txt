Things we could add
-------------------

- include directive is flexible but ugly.
  allow either a name for a directive eg. @import or #include
  or a regular expression as we have now.
  allow a string or an array-ref

- add a postprocess directive allowing to use eg. scss
  Postprocessing happens before minifiying

- does it make sense to add a way to auto-generate CSS files from sass
  using eg. compass?
  http://github.com/chriseppstein/compass
  if we do, do we have a way to cache files efficiently somewhere?

- document examples for pseudo-versioning by adding a version-number into URL

- looks like uri_for() magic stops working after some Moose version. find out.

### done.
- allow some kind of 'include' directive in the config section:
  $1 will contain a file to include
  (will work recursively)
    include => [
        qr{\@import \s+ (?:url\s*\()? ["']? ([^"')]+) ["']? [)]? .*? ;}xms
    ],

## done 2010-04-13 by Phil Soehnlein. 'Expires' is cool.
- find out clever HTTP Headers to set.

### done.
- add to config section:
    replace => {
                       # for every file -- how to quote '$1' ??? --> s{$regex}{qq{qq{$replace}}}ee
        '*'         => [ 'url\\(images/([^)]+)\\)' => 'url(/static/images/$1)' ],
        
                       # some files only
        'jquery*'   => [ qr'color:\s*#123456' => 'color: #987654' ],
        
                       # just this file
        'jquery-ui' => [ ... => ... ],
    },
