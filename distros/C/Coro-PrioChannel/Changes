Revision history for Coro-PrioChannel

        ! Some testers don't have sub-second timers (?), such as
          perl 5.17.{[789],10}, or darwin (?), causing a failure in
          t/06_reprio.t.  Workaround in the test, not the code.
          If you are missing sub-second timers, this is likely your
          perl, not this module nor AnyEvent.

        + Queues now age items to prevent starvation

        + Add optional minimum-priority-level to size. Need to figure it out
          for get, too (blocking here is harder, as will be testing).

        + Add github metadata
        + Add some better documentation for put (hey, it's all relative)
