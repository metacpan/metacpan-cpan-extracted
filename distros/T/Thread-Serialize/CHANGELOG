1.02	9 November 2019
	Adoption.

1.01    7 December 2012
        Upgraded to Devel::MaintBlead 0.08.  This should fix the problem as
        reported in https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=81354 by
        Justin Traer.  Also upgraded the maint version to 0.14.

1.00    11 June 2012
        Now uses Devel::ThreadsForks for checking whether running on a thread
        enabled Perl.

        Now uses Devel::MaintBlead to keep a maint and a blead version going.
        Blead version now no longer requires the "load" module: I considered
        it to have been a premature optimization that just caused a lot of
        grief.

        Raised the "maint" version to 0.13 as to distinguish it from the older,
        now maint version.

        Upgraded test-suite for blead to use the latest in Test::More's
        threading capabilities.

0.12    1 April 2012
        Some cleanup in distro.  Some code cleanup as well, as well as some
        code esthetics.  Verified it work with 5.14.2.

0.11    20 September 2010
        Checking the tool chain with perl 5.13.5.

0.10    29 September 2004
        Added support for $Thread::Serialize::no_external_perl to prevent
        problems when used in embedded Perls.  Spotted by Philip Monsen.
        Added documentation and additional tests in the test-suite.

0.09    28 December 2003
        Added automatic required modules update using Devel::Required.

0.08    18 September 2003
        Upgraded dependency on load to 0.10, since that has some significant
        Windows fixes.

0.07    17 September 2003
        Upgraded dependency on load to 0.09.

        17 August 2003
        Some documentation fixes: we're not using AutoLoader anymore.

0.06    11 August 2003
        Fixed some nits in Makefile.PL.  Updated copyright notice.

        Fixed dependency on order of hash keys in test-suite: this caused
        spurious testing errors in 5.8.1.

0.05    30 September 2002
        Removed support for AutoLoader and replaced it by support for "load.pm".
        Added dependency on "load" to Makefile.PL.

        Removed "our" from $VERSION, should shave off some bytes in memory
        usage, as found from testing with Benchmark::Thread::Size.

0.04    22 September 2002
        Fixed warnings when running under -w.  Thanks to Chris Rosebrugh for
        the spot.

0.03    10 September 2002
        Removed the NOT_ICED environment variable hack and its documentation.
        Replaced by having an external Perl process calculate the Storable
        (iced) signature at load time.  This should be compatible with all
        versions of Storable on all possible OS's and hardware architectures.

0.02    30 August 2002
        Now uses pre-frozen signature value unless told otherwise.  This saves
        Storable::freeze to have to be available in all threads.  Can be
        circumvented by specifying NOT_ICED environment variable.  Added
        OPTIMIZATIONS and CAVEATS sections to the pod.

        Added support for AutoLoader.  Together with all of the other Thread::
        modules, this should start saving a lot of memory.

        Removed reference tricks: we should find other ways of saving memory
        with threads.

0.01    13 August 2002
        First version of Thread::Serialize.
