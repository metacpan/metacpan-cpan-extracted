0.0102  2007-06-12
        * Fixed a class-inheritance-graph problem in which the plugin
        inherited from Test::Run::Core and caused the functions of the
        plugins following it to be referenced directly from Test::Run::Core.
        * Note: instead of inheriting from Class::Accessor inherit from
        Test::Run::Base which defines ->new properly.
