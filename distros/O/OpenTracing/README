NAME

    OpenTracing - support for https://opentracing.io application tracing

DESCRIPTION

    This is an early implementation, so the API may be subject to change.

    In general, you'll want to create an OpenTracing::Batch, then add one
    or more OpenTracing::Span instances to it. Those instances can have
    zero or more OpenTracing::Log entries.

    See the following classes for more information:

      * OpenTracing::Tag

      * OpenTracing::Log

      * OpenTracing::Span

      * OpenTracing::SpanProxy

      * OpenTracing::Process

      * OpenTracing::Batch
