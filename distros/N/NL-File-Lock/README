NAME
    NL::File::Lock - File locking (based on lockfiles)

SYNOPSIS
            use NL::File::Lock;

            # We will create locks for that file:
            my $filename = 'test_file.txt';

            # Writing all lockfiles to '/tmp' directory:
            &NL::File::Lock::init('/tmp');
            # If no 'NL::File::Lock::init' called - all lockfiles
            # will be at the same directorys as files

            # ---
            # Lock for writing (only one process can write)
            # 'timeout' - time to wait lock
            # 'time_sleep' - time to sleep between locking retrys
            if (&NL::File::Lock::lock_write($filename, { 'timeout' => 10, 'time_sleep' => 0.1 } )) {
                    # File locked
                    # ... code ...
                    &NL::File::Lock::unlock($filename);
            }
            else {
                    # Unable to lock file
            }

            # ---
            # Lock for reading (many processes can read)
            # 'timeout' - time to wait lock
            # 'time_sleep' - time to sleep between locking retrys
            if (&NL::File::Lock::lock_read($filename, { 'timeout' => 10, 'time_sleep' => 0.1 } )) {
                    # File locked
                    # ... code ...

DESCRIPTION
    This module is used to easy and portable file locking.

EXAMPLES
            # ---
            # Lock for writing (only one process can write)
            my $filename = 'test_file.txt';
            # 'timeout' - time to wait lock
            # 'time_sleep' - time to sleep between locking retrys
            if (&NL::File::Lock::lock_write($filename, { 'timeout' => 10, 'time_sleep' => 0.1 } )) {

                    print "-UnLocked for some time...\n";
                    sleep(5);
