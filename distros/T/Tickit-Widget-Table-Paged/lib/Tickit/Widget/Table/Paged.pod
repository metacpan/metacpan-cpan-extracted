=head1 METHODS

=head2 new

Instantiate. Will attempt to take focus.

=head1 METHODS - Table content

=head2 data

Returns the table's current data content as an arrayref.

Note that it is not recommended to make any changes to this
data structure - you are responsible for triggering any
necessary redrawing or resizing logic if you choose to do so.

=head2 clear

Clear all data in the table.

=head2 add_row

Add a row to the table. Data should be provided as a list with one item per
column.

Returns $self.

=head2 add_column

Add a new column. Takes the following named parameters:

=over 4

=item * width - (optional) number of columns

=item * type - (optional) data type, currently only supports 'text' (the default)

=item * align - (optional) align left, center or right

=back

=head2 selected_rows

Returns the selected row, or multiple rows as a list if multi_select is enabled.
If multi_select is enabled it does not return the row currently highlighted (unless that row is also selected).

=head1 METHODS - Callbacks

=head2 on_activate

Accessor for the activation callback - if called without parameters,
will return the current coderef (if any), otherwise, will set the new
callback.

This callback will be triggered via L</key_activate>:

 $code->($row_index, $row_data_as_arrayref)

If multiselect is enabled, the callback will have the following:

 $code->(
   [$highlight_row_index, @selected_row_indices],
   $highlight_row_data_as_arrayref,
   @selected_rows_as_arrayrefs
 )

(the selected row data + index list could be empty here)

=head1 TODO

Current list of pending features:

=over 4

=item * Storage abstraction - the main difference between this widget and
L<Tickit::Widget::Table> is that this is designed to work with a storage
abstraction. The current abstraction implementation needs more work before
it's reliable enough for release, so this version only has basic arrayref
support.

=item * Column and cell highlighting modes

=item * Proper widget-in-cell support

=item * Formatters for converting raw cell data into printable format
(without having to go through a separate widget)

=item * Better header support (more than one row, embedded widgets)

=back

=head1 SEE ALSO

=over 4

=item * L<Tickit::Widget::Table> - older table implementation based on L<Tickit::Widget::HBox> and L<Tickit::Widget::VBox>
widgets. Does not support scrolling and performance isn't as good, so it will eventually be merged with this one.

=item * L<Text::ANSITable> - not part of L<Tickit> but has some impressive styling capabilities.
