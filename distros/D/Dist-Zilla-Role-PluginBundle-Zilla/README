SYNOPSIS

 Dist::Zilla::Role::PluginBundle

        package Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::MyBundle;

        use Moose;
        with 'Dist::Zilla::Role::PluginBundle::Zilla';

        sub bundle_config {
            my ( $class, $section ) = @_;

            my $self = $class->new($section);

            $self->log_fatal('Something went wrong...');

            return;
        }

 Dist::Zilla::Role::PluginBundle::Easy

        package Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::MyBundle;

        use Moose;
        with 'Dist::Zilla::Role::PluginBundle::Easy';
        with 'Dist::Zilla::Role::PluginBundle::Zilla';

        sub configure {
            my ($self) = @_;

            $self->log('Hello from your friendly bundle! We are running in ' . $self->zilla->root);
            $self->log_fatal('Something went wrong...');

            return;
        }

DESCRIPTION

    This role makes the zilla object available and adds the log, log_fatal,
    and log_debug methods to your bundle.

    This allows you to use the same logging procedure in your bundle that
    plugins use.

    If you use Dist::Zilla::Role::PluginBundle::Easy you have to import
    these two roles with two separate calls to with because both roles
    declare the name attribute.
