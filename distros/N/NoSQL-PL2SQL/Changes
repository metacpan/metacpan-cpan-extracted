	- original version; created by h2xs 1.23 with options
		-An NoSQL::PL2SQL

1.00  Mon Oct  8 13:01:46 2012
	- Incremented the version for release.

1.01  Sat Nov  3 12:50:08 EDT 2012
	- Ironically, PL2SQL::SQLObject() actually failed to bless 
	  unblessed objects.  An explicit bless() was added.
	- Added a test to insert an undef.
	- Cleaned up documentation.

1.02  Tue Nov 13 13:36:42 EST 2012
	- Fixed a few more documentation typos.
	- Tests to make sure PL2SQL methods handle non-tied objects.
	- Fixed PL2SQL::Object::sqlobject() to identify and return
	  untied containers

1.03  Mon Nov 19 12:09:17 EST 2012
	- Fixed a few more documentation typos.
	- Throws an error on duplicate ObjectID assignment
	- Added support for SQLObject() error handlers
	- Added SQLError() method to assign error handlers
	- Fixed a bug in PL2SQL::Object::DESTROY() preventing
	  items from being added to empty containers

1.04  Sat Nov 24 16:55:47 EST 2012
	- Fixed a bug in PL2SQL::Node::stringsplit() which converted 
	  a 0 length string to undefined
	- Fixed a bug in PL2SQL::Object::DESTROY() which sometimes lost 
	  global values writing new nodes.
	- PL2SQL::DBI methods have been revised and are more useful for
	  data sources other than PL2SQL:

	- Generalized PL2SQL::DBI::fetch() and PL2SQL::DBI::perldata()
	  methods to handle arbitrary schemas
	- PL2SQL::DBI::perldata() arguments are explicitly defined
	- PL2SQL::DBI::delete() now accepts the same argument format as
	  PL2SQL::DBI::fetch()
	- PL2SQL::DBI::table() can be invoked as a factory

1.10  Tue Nov 27 13:54:59 EST 2012
	- cksums.txt was incomplete
	- Incremented minor version to reflect new functionality in PL2SQL::DBI

	lib/NoSQL/PL2SQL/DBI.pm
	  - Schema changed: CREATE INDEX
	  - indexschema() method added
	  - sqlstatement() sprintf changed to allow multiple terms
	  - table() can now be overloaded as a factory constructor
	    in order to share a db handle among several dsn's
	  - Methods db(), connect(), and dbconnect() now reflect this change
	  - Method sqlupdate() added:  Allows an SQL UPDATE statement to
	    be generated using the same conditional arguments as fetch().
	  - update() return value now contains {nvp} property that is
	    passed to the sqlupdate() method.
	  - perldata() returns array of hashes of rows_hash() unless
	    exists {id} property

	lib/NoSQL/PL2SQL/Object.pm
	  - The test that determines the perldata header record was
	    rewritten as it sometimes found the wrong record.

	- lib/NoSQL/DBI/SQLite.pm was updated to reflect the changes
	  in lib/NoSQL/DBI.pm

1.11  Thu Dec 13 10:02:28 EST 2012
	- Overloaded DESTROY method now fails gracefully
	- Added method descriptors to sqlite.t so I can interprete
	  the CPAN test reports

1.12  Thu Dec 20 13:30:05 EST 2012
	- Changed XML::Parser requirement to 2.41
	- stringtest() fixed in sqlite.t
	- Fixed insertall().  Scalars with refct > 1 need to be preserved.  
	  When the delete flag is set, the chained string was recalculated 		  on undefined scalar data, resulting in a broken chain.  

1.13  Sat Dec 22 09:52:39 EST 2012
	- Fixed insertall() again (false postive on zero length strings)

1.14  Tue Jan 22 12:36:46 EST 2013
	- NoSQL::PL2SQL::DBI::perldata() has been changed again.  New 
	  invocation:
	    $dsn->fetch()->perldata

1.20  Tue Mar  5 15:06:19 EST 2013
	- Minor release:  Implements record locking and full vs partial \		  updates for better concurrent data access:
	    Added NoSQL::PL2SQL::Lock class definition
	    Added NoSQL::PL2SQL::Clone class definition
	    Added method NoSQL::PL2SQL::Object::package
	    Added method NoSQL::PL2SQL::Object::objectkey
	    Added method NoSQL::PL2SQL::Object::innerclone
	- Fixed a bug- now maintains internal references in SQLClone() clones.
	- Eliminated NoSQL::PL2SQL::DBI::perldata() * NO BACKWARDS CAPABILITY *
	- Rewrote documentation of NoSQL::PL2SQL::DBI to reflect usage
	  independent of NoSQL::PL2SQL.
	- Error handlers are now specifically assigned to a class.

1.21  Mon Apr 29 23:37:09 EDT 2013
	- Updated to reflect dependencies
	- Refactored NoSQL::PL2SQL::Object
	    data()
	    FETCH()
	    DELETE()
	- Added internal %scalars to NoSQL::PL2SQL::Nodes::insertall
