NAME
    Mail::ExpandAliases - Expand aliases from /etc/aliases files

SYNOPSIS
      use Mail::ExpandAliases;

      my $ma = Mail::ExpandAliases->new("/etc/aliases");
      my @list = $ma->expand("listname");

DESCRIPTION
    I've looked for software to expand aliases from an alias file for a
    while, but have never found anything adequate. In this day and age, few
    public SMTP servers support EXPN, which makes alias expansion
    problematic. This module, and the accompanying "expand-alias" script,
    attempts to address that deficiency.

USAGE
    Mail::ExpandAliases is an object oriented module, with a constructor
    named "new":

      my $ma = Mail::ExpandAliases->new("/etc/mail/aliases");

    "new" takes the filename of an aliases file; if not supplied, or if the
    file specified does not exist or is not readable, Mail::ExpandAliases
    will look in a predetermined set of default locations and use the first
    one found. See the section on "ALIAS FILE LOCATIONS", below, for details
    on this search path and how to modify it.

    Lookups are made using the "expand" method:

      @aliases = $ma->expand("listname");

    "expand" returns a list of expanded addresses, sorted alphabetically.
    These expanded addresses are also expanded, whenever possible.

    A non-expandible alias (no entry in the aliases file) expands to itself,
    i.e., does not expand.

    In scalar context, "expand" returns a reference to a list.

    Note that Mail::ExpandAliases provides read-only access to the alias
    file. If you are looking for read access, see Mail::Alias, which is a
    more general interface to alias files.

    Mail::ExpandAliases make a resonable attempt to handle aliases the way
    "sendmail" does, including loop detection and support for escaped named.
    See chapter 24, "Aliases", in *Sendmail*
    (<http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/sendmail/>) for full details about this
    process.

ALIAS FILE LOCATIONS
    Paths to the aliases file can be added globally at compile time:

      use Mail::ExpandAliases qw(/etc/exim/aliases);

    Alias file locations can also be specified to instances when they are
    constructed:

      my $ma = Mail::ExpandAliases->new("/etc/exim/aliases");

    Alias file locations are stored in the package global
    @POSSIBLE_ALIAS_FILES, which can be assigned to directly if you're not
    impressed with encapsulation:

      @Mail::ExpandAliases::POSSIBLE_ALIAS_FILES = ("/etc/aliases");

    By default, @POSSIBLE_ALIAS_FILES contains /etc/aliases,
    /etc/mail/aliases, /etc/postfix/aliases, and /etc/exim/aliases. If your
    alias file is ones of these, the filename can be omitted from the
    constructor; Mail::ExpandAliases will look in @POSSIBLE_ALIAS_FILES
    until it finds a file that exists.

    Note that it is not (necessarily) an error if none of these files
    exists. An alias file can be added by passing a filename to the init()
    method:

      my $ma = Mail::ExpandAliases->new();

      # Write a temporary aliases file in /tmp/aliases-$<
      $ma->init("/tmp/aliases-$<");

    Calling expand before setting an alias file will, of course, produce no
    useful expansions.

    If the constructor is called with the name of a file that exists but
    cannot be opened, Mail::ExpandAliases will die with an error detailing
    the problem.

BUGS / SHORTCOMINGS
    If you were telnet mailhost 25, and the server had EXPN turned on, then
    sendmail would read a user's .forward file. This software cannot do
    that, and makes no attempt to. Only the invoking user's .forward file
    should be readable (if any other user's .forward file was readable,
    sendmail would not read it, making this feature useless), and the
    invoking user should not need this module to read their own .forward
    file.

    Any other shortcomings, bugs, errors, or generally related complaints
    and requests should be reported via the appropriate queue at
    <http://rt.cpan.org/>.
