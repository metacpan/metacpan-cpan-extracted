NAME
    README for Algorithm::BinarySearch::Vec - binary search and basic set
    operations for vec()-vectors

DESCRIPTION
    The Algorithm::BinarySearch::Vec perl module provides binary search
    functions and basic set operations for vec()-vectors, including fast XS
    implementations, which are used by default if available.

INSTALLATION
  Building from Source
    To build and install the entire package, issue the following commands to
    the shell:

    More details on the top-level installation process can be found in the
    perlmodinstall(1) manpage.
