0.11 Thu Nov 10 07:59:11 EST 2005
	- Dealt with a slight change in CR format introduced in CC 6.0.
	  This simply suppresses a warning issued with the new format.

0.12 Mon Nov 21 16:53:48 EST 2005
	- Fixed a number of Windows-specific bugs involving paths
	  (/-vs-\, case sensitivity, and drive letters).
	- Fix: do not assume a variables section between MVFS Objects
	  and Build Script in a CR.

0.15 Fri Oct 20 07:38:16 EDT 2006
	- Major cleanup of code.
	- Added cr2mf script suite for regeneration of Makefiles
	  from config records (proof of concept only)
	- Removed support for Data::Denter, which is deprecated
	  nowadays and in any case was only ever here as a proof
	  of concept.
	- Actually, all support for alternate storage formats
	  has been removed. I don't believe it was being used and
	  I'm not in a position to test it. There's nothing to
	  stop it from being put back in later.
	- Now uses catcr in -long mode, allowing more intelligent
	  handling of sibling derived objects.
	- Whouses adds a new interactive mode so you can "browse"
	  your way through dependencies.
