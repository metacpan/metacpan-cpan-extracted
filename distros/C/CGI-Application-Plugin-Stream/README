NAME
    CGI::Application::Plugin::Stream - CGI::Application Plugin for streaming
    files

SYNOPSIS
      use CGI::Application::Plugin::Stream (qw/stream_file/);

      sub runmode {
        # ...

        # Set up any headers you want to set explicitly
        # using header_props() or header_add() as usual

        #...

        if ( $self->stream_file( $file ) ) {
          return;
        } else {
          return $self->error_mode();
        }
      }

DESCRIPTION
    This plugin provides a way to stream a file back to the user.

    This is useful if you are creating a PDF or Spreadsheet document
    dynamically to deliver to the user.

    The file is read and printed in small chunks to keep memory consumption
    down.

    This plugin is a consumer, as in your runmode shouldn't try to do any
    output or anything afterwards. This plugin affects the HTTP response
    headers, so anything you do afterwards will probably not work. If you
    pass along a filehandle, we'll make sure to close it for you.

    It's recommended that you increment $| (or set it to 1), which will
    autoflush the buffer as your application is streaming out the file.

METHODS
  stream_file()
      $self->stream_file($fh);
      $self->stream_file( '/path/to/file',2048);

    This method can take two parameters, the first the path to the file or a
    filehandle and the second, an optional number of bytes to determine the
    chunk size of the stream. It defaults to 1024.

    It will either stream a file to the user or return false if it fails,
    perhaps because it couldn't find the file you referenced.

    We highly recommend you provide a file name if passing along a
    filehandle, as we won't be able to deduce the file name, and will use
    'FILE' by default. Example:

     $self->header_add( -attachment => 'my_file.txt' );

    With both a file handle or file name, we will try to determine the
    correct content type by using File::MMagic. A default of
    'application/octet-stream' will be used if File::MMagic can't figure it
    out.

    The size will be calculated and added to the headers as well.

    Again, you can set these explicitly if you want as well:

     $self->header_add(
          -type                     =>      'text/plain',
          -Content_Length   =>      42, # bytes
     );
