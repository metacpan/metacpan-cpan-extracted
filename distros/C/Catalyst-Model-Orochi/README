        Model::Orochi:
            injections: # for literal values
                name01: value01 
            classes:
                - ClassName01
                - ClassName02
            namespaces:

DESCRIPTION
    This model integrates Orochi DI container with Catalyst. The same
    caveats from Orochi apply.

CONFIGURATION KEYS
    injections
        A hashref of literal values. Same as inject_literal() or
        Orochi::Injection::Literal

    classes
        A list of class names. These classes should be using MooseX::Orochi.
        If the class does not use, or have an ancestor that uses
        MooseX::Orochi, the class will be silently ignored

    namespaces
        A list of namespaces. Any class files found under the namespace that
        uses MooseX::Orochi will be included.
