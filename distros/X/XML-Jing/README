NAME
    XML::Jing - Validate XML files using an RNG schema using the Jing tool

VERSION
    version 0.04

SYNOPSIS
            use XML::Jing;
            my $jing = XML::Jing->new('path/to/rng','use compact RNG');
            my $error = $jing->validate('path/to/xml');
            if(!$error){
                    print 'no errors!';
            }else{
                    print $error;
            }

DESCRIPTION
    This module is a simple interface to Jing which allows checking XML
    files for validity using an RNG file.

METHODS
  "new"
    Arguments: the path to the RNG file to use in validation, and a boolean
    indicating whether or not the given RNG file uses compact syntax (false
    means XML syntax)

    Creates a new instance of "XML::Jing".

  "validate"
    Argument: path to the XML file to validate

    Returns: The first error found in the document, or "undef" if no errors
    were found.

TODO
    Jing has more functionality and options than what I have interfaced with
    here.

    Also, it would be nice to be able to get ALL of the errors in an XML
    file, instead of jut the first one.
