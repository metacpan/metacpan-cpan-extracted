NAME
    Module::Modular - Create optional plugins for your module

DESCRIPTION
    Module::Modular allows you, or others, to create plugins for your
    modules. They are not loaded by default - only when you want them to be.
    This means you can even load them further on down in your module if you
    wish. The idea is to have your plugins handle certain tasks you don't
    want cluttering the core code of your module. I started writing this
    before I came across another plugin module called Module::Pluggable. So
    if you like how that one works better, or even prefer the name (I do),
    then go check it out. This one is different in the sense you explicitly
    tell your module what plugins to load, and each plugin may have an
    initialiser ("__init") that will get run once it has been loaded, which
    I found pretty neat. This module is modular itself. By importing "with"
    followed by an array of options you can extend the functionality of
    Module::Modular. Currently just the one option is available
    ("Accessors") which provides methods for accessing meta data of your
    plugins. A plugin can only be loaded if it's within the same namespace
    and within your path (ie: YourModule::Plugin::*)

SYNOPSIS
        # MyModule.pm
    
        package MyModule;

        use Module::Modular;
        load_plugins qw<Foo Bar>;
    
        sub load_another_plugin {
            load_plugins 'DifferentOne';
        }

        # MyModule::Plugin::Foo
        package MyModule::Plugin::Foo;

        sub __init {
            my ($class, $name) = @_;
            # $class = MyModule::Plugin::Foo
            # $name  = Foo

            # some code here to be run when loaded
        }

        sub foo {
            print "You have been foo'd!\n";
        }

    Now, when you "use MyModule", the Foo plugin will get loaded and run
    "__init" from "MyModule::Plugin::Foo". Simple. The initialiser is
    completely optional. It's quite simple to get a list of plugins, or you
    can get hold of a single plugin to do stuff with.

        # Run the foo() method within the Foo plugin
        my $foo_plugin = $module->plugin('Foo')->foo();

    Calling the "plugins" method will return an array of your loaded
    plugins. Each one will be blessed, so you have objects to work with
    which makes things easier.

        # call the foo() method on every loaded plugin
        for my $plugin ($module->plugins) {
            $plugin->foo();
        }

METHODS
    "Module::Modular" exports only a few functions into your module. They
    are...

  load_plugins
      void load_plugins(@list)

    Takes an array of plugins (Not their entire path, just the name of the
    plugin. For example, if I wanted to load "MyModule::Plugin::Foo" I would
    only have to use "load_plugins 'Foo'". If it can't load the module for
    any reason it will print out a warnings and move onto the next one if
    it's specified.

  plugins
      @array plugins(void)

    Returns an array of your loaded plugins. It will only register those
    introduced by "load_plugins", just having one in the right namespace and
    loaded by any other means will do nothing.

  plugin
      $object plugin(string)

    Returns a blessed reference of a plugin (ie: The plugin object). You
    only need to supply the name, not the entire path. For example

        my $plugin = $module->plugin('Foo');

  stash
    This is a plugin method (Called from a plugin only). It's a really
    simple method used to get the data of a specific global variable from
    the base module. After all, what's the point of a plugin if you have
    absolutely no way to share data, right?

        # MyModule.pm
        package MyModule;

        use Module::Modular;

        our $PluginStash = { bees => 'knees' };
        load_plugins 'Bees';

        # MyModule::Plugin::Bees
        package MyModule::Plugin::Bees;

        sub __init {
            my ($self, $name) = @_;
            print "The $name have " . $self->stash('bees');
        }

    It's not overly useful, secure, or remotely interesting, but if you need
    a quick and dirty way to get some data to your plugins, it works. I am
    trying to find a neater solution..

  OPTIONS
    When you "use Module::Modular" you can pass a key called "with" as an
    arrayref of options or just a string for a single option.

    Accessors

    Implements specific accessors to access the meta data of a plugin

        # MyModule.pm
        use Module::Modular
            with => 'Accessors';

        load_plugins qw<Foo Bar>;

        # test.pl
        for my $plugin ($module->plugins) {
            say "Name: " . $plugin->name;
            say "Version: " . $plugin->version;
        }

    Strict

    Will not allow you to get a plugin object directly from outside the core
    modules scope

        # MyModule.pm
        use Module::Modular
            with => [qw<Accessors Strict>];

        load_plugins 'Foo';
        sub get_plugin { my $self = shift; return $self->plugin('Foo'); }

        # test.pl
        my $c = MyModule->new;
        $c->plugin('Foo')->foo(); # fails
        my $plugin = $c->get_plugin(); # works, because it went through the core module first
