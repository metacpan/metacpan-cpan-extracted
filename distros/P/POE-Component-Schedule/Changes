Revision history for POE-Component-Schedule

0.95    2010-05-25T22:36+02:00    DOLMEN (Olivier Mengué)
        No changes since 0.94_03.
        Only change since 0.94 is fix for RT#56447 (allow POE aliases as target
          session ID for events).

0.94_03 2010-05-25T00:14+02:00    DOLMEN (Olivier Mengué)
        No functional change since 0.94_01.
        Fixed constant functions: added "()" prototype to make them inlinable
          by perl. Should have been like that since 0.91_01. That should
          improve performance.
        Added .perlcriticrc to disable Perl::Critic policies that do not match
          our style (filled RT#57638, RT#57639, RT#57640, RT#57807 for issues
          with default policies).
        Made some suggestions from Perl::Critic. Reduced number of lines, so
          improved test coverage ratio.
        Test coverage: 94.5%.
        Author build system: fixed the 'Build tag'.
        Author build system: improved steps to publish 'Changes.rss' in the
          Google Code wiki area.

0.94_02 2010-05-18T01:02+02:00    DOLMEN (Olivier Mengué)
        Author build system: Changes.{rss,yml} generation is now automated by
          extending Module::Build (see 'inc/MY/Build.pm' and
          'inc/MY/Build/Changes.pm').
        Added 't/90-critic.t' to 'MANIFEST.SKIP' as it is the main cause of
          CPAN Testers failures.
        Author build system: Drop 'Makefile.PL' generation by Module::Build.
        Author build system: Transformed 'make-svn-tag.pl' into a Build target
          ('tag').

0.94_01 2010-05-09T19:44+02:00    DOLMEN (Olivier Mengué)
        RT#56447 fixed, but I expect to unapply the fix once RT#57314
          (allow aliases in $poe_kernel->refcount_{in,de}crement) is
          implemented. Test cases added.
        Bug references are now linked in 'Changes.rss'.
        Test coverage: 91.6%.

0.94    2010-03-13T16:37+01:00    DOLMEN (Olivier Mengué)
        Only minor POD changes in Schedule.pm since 0.93_02.
        Increased dependencies versions.
        Small tweak to the 'Changes' file format to make it more parseable
          and be able to generate 'Changes.yml' and 'Changes.rss'.
        Added 'Changes.rss' and 'Changes.yml', generated from 'Changes'
          using either 'make-Changes-rss.pl' or 'make-Changes-rss-2.pl' (see
          SVN repo).
        Test coverage: 92.1%.

0.93_02 2010-02-13T16:30+01:00    DOLMEN (Olivier Mengué)
        More test coverage, but still only 92.1%. Help still welcome for
          RT#53925.
        Improved argument check for ->add() (and now, with tests too).
        POE >= 1.281 is recommended as it fixes the _child(lose) issue.
        Updated POD: removed obsolete warnings, updated copyright.
        Updated README: should be more helpful for distribution packagers.

0.93_01 2010-02-13T01:55+01:00    DOLMEN (Olivier Mengué)
        Applied fix for RT#53925 (Patch by Zeph Gillen).
        Added t/50-subclass.t to try to catch subclassing problems which may
          affect POE::Component::Cron. Unfortunately it does not catch
          RT#53925. Help needed.
        Added strictures in tests.
        Updated 'MANIFEST.SKIP' to match new Module::Build: ignore MYMETA.yml.

0.92    2009-11-20T19:17+01:00    DOLMEN (Olivier Mengué)
        Official Release. Have to review doc before 1.00.
        Fixed my local YAML.pm to have correct encoding of 'META.yml'.

0.91_01 2009-11-19T20:55+01:00    DOLMEN (Olivier Mengué)
        Major internal rewrite. No external changes. I love TDD!
        Now the scheduling session is detached from the session from
          which the session was spawned. This should help to avoid session
          attachment/references problems as the scheduler is not anymore
          attached to a particular session. Note that due to a POE bug,
          _child(lose) is still fired.
        Fixed typos in example code. kthakore++
        TODO: add a test that extracts test code from the
              SYNOPSIS POD section and runs it. Maybe using
              Test::Pod::Snippets.

0.03    2009-06-16T19:10+02:00    DOLMEN (Olivier Mengué)
        Major improvement of POD. Fixed sample code.
        Improved test suite to check session reference counting.
        Added DESTROY handler for schedule handles to automatically
          delete handles which are not anymore referenced.
        Deprecated ->delete().

0.02    2009-06-15T23:09+02:00    DOLMEN (Olivier Mengué)
        Changed the default session alias to $class.
        Fixed warning in Schedule.pm about new() not being used.
        Improved test suite to increase code coverage (added 11-two.t).
        Improved documentation for spawn().
        Thanks to Rob Fugina for discussion.

0.01    2009-06-05T19:56+02:00    DOLMEN (Olivier Mengué)
        First release to the world, with Chris Fedde's blessing.
        This a fork of POE::Component::Cron 0.019. See RT#44442.
