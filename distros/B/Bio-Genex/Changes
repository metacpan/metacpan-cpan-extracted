Revision history for Perl extension Genex.

2.6.0 Tue Feb  6 15:48:00 MST 2001
      - XMLUtils.pm:
        Added the beginings of a real XML API, defining db2xml() and
	   all2xml() for some classes
	Now defines Bio::Genex::GeneXML and ::GeneXML::USF helper
	   classes 
	Fixed pretty_print() to preserve whitespace
      - DBUtils.pm:
        now has many more assert_* methods
        new helper method: fetch_db_ids_for_species() that does a
	   join accross the USF, and ExternalDatabase tables
      - Genex.pm:
        now has timestamp() helper method, so that all DB timestamps
	   can be formatted identically
      - GenexAdmin.pm:
        Class interface to new table. This enables a DB history
	mechanism to record changes to the DB installation
      - get_objects() fixed for all classes
      - db2xml.pl: 
        fixed a BlastHits bug
	added pretty_print() again
	Fixed caching of control bundles, so that the <misc_list> is 
	   specific to each download
      - cv-insert.pl:
        now records info into GenexAdmin
        now uses --name option to identify *who* made the changes
	uses --dbname to specify what DB to use
      - status.pl:
        New CGI script that shows all version information pertinent to
	   the server installation. 

2.5.0 Fri Jan 26 02:38:59 MST 2001
      - db2xml.pl:
        caching of experiment sets and control-bunldes implemented
        now has --no_cache option to avoid using or setting cache
	--user/--password now optional unless --authenticate is specified
	Removed citationlink()
	Fixed aweful citation bug that never showed up, because
	   citationlink table was never populated
      - Fixed API for get_objects() by creating new method
	   get_all_objects().
      - fixed bug in check_password()
      - XMLUtils.pm.in
	Added new framework for implementing class-specific XML output. 
	Implemented output for Chromosome, and partial output for Species
	   (still needs USF for completeness).
      - DBUtils.pm.in (Repository): 
	Added new assert_* methods: 
	   assert_species
	   assert_protocol
	   assert_scanner
	   assert_software
	   assert_spotter
	   assert_array
	   assert_experiment
	check_password() no longer dies() with a bad password, instead it
	   returns undef
      - UserSequenceFeature, ExperimentSet and ArrayMeasurement now have
           provider_con_fk() and  provider_con_obj() methods
	post_process() no longer automatically derefences the con_obj()
	   from a us_obj, it first tests the definedness
      - ExternalDatabase: Fixed full name
      - list_tables.pl.in: Fixed name of HTML title

2.4.0 Tue Jan 16 09:50:56 MST 2001
      - Changed to Bio::Genex namespace
      - Now gets INSTALLSITELIB, INSTALLMAN1DIR, and INSTALLMAN3DIR from
	   Config.PM 

2.2.0 Sun Jan 14 16:37:46 MST 2001
      - Is now compatible as part of complete GeneX installation or as
        update of just Genex.pm
      - db2xml.pl can now use cached control bundle files
      - example scripts now have more flexibility to choose a
        different DB if DEBUG is set.

2.1.2 Tue Jan  9 18:00:51 MST 2001
      - Genex.pm is now included as part of the larger GeneX
        installation process
      - Renamed GEML to GeneXML
      - reorganization of directories (query and curation_tool
        removed, cgi renamed to samples).

2.1.1 Sat Dec  2 13:29:50 MST 2000
      - Changed HTMLUtils::post_process(), it now is much more modular
        and handles errors more intelligently

2.1.0 Sun Nov 12 22:27:02 MST 2000
      - Major upgrade for Bio::Genex::current_connection(). The $Bio::Genex::*
        global variables are still available, but current_connection()
        now takes key/value style arguments when making a
        connection. If given arguments, it checks their value against
        those of the current db handle and if any differ, it will
        invalidate the handle and create a new connection.
      - DBUtils::check_password() enables checking username/password
        pairs from the UserSec table. 
      - UserSec table now stores passwords in crypt() format using the
        first two letters of the login as salt.
      - Makefile.PL now sets four DB user variables:
	$Bio::Genex::RO_USERNAME
	$Bio::Genex::RO_PASSWORD
	$Bio::Genex::SU_USERNAME
	$Bio::Genex::SU_PASSWORD
	They are accessible by programs	that don't want to hard-code
	usernames and passwords for the readonly => RO, and super-user
	=> SU accounts. 
      - list_tables.pl and fetch_table.pl can now access alternate
        DB's by specifying the dbname parameter.
      - HTMLUtils::post_process() now includes the raw fkey as well as
        the pretty printed name 
      - new geml.dtd (two minor #REQUIRED ==> #IMPLIED modifications)

2.0.8 Tue Oct 31 13:45:46 MST 2000
      - Fixed linking table bug in get_objects().
      - get_objects() API now resolved:
	   * get_objects('ALL') 
	   * get_objects({column=>foo,value=>bar})  ==> no 'ALL'
	   * get_objects(@ids) 	
      - db2xml now handles treatments correctly
      - minor geml.dtd modifications

2.0.7 Thu Oct 26 16:44:46 MST 2000
      - Added new configuration parameters that enable installing the
        gxquery scripts and the curation-tool scripts properly
      - Changes to data files

2.0.6 Tue Oct 24 16:50:40 MST 2000
      - included query/Makefile.PL which slipped through the cracks

2.0.5 Tue Oct 24 16:05:40 MST 2000
      - Changed URL in HTMLUtils.pm to point to sample scripts
      - added new configuration options that query for the directories
        to install the sample cgi scripts and the query cgi scripts
      - added Makefile.PL to query and install_query target to primary
        Makefile, and query/Makefile

2.0.4 Tue Oct 24 15:56:40 MST 2000
      - added new configuration option for locating the analysis tools

2.0.3 Tue Oct 24 15:22:40 MST 2000
      - added new configuration options for placing the query iterface
        and the sample CGI scripts in different directories 

2.0.2 Tue Oct 24 14:22:40 MST 2000
      - updated controlled vocabulary XML
      - add new data XML files in data/db_tables
      - added gxquery/ 
      - minor fixes to db2xml.pl

2.0.1 Wed Oct 18 22:13:38 MST 2000
      - Added db2xml.pl.in
      - All dtd's now have versions
      - eliminated numerous warnings from all modules
      - xml-write.pl renamed to db2xml.pl
      - new functionality for create_insert_sql() for creating SQL
        without placeholders
      - Made error messages more verbose
      - use of DBUtils::fetch_fkey_list() is depricated, use
        get_objects() instead

2.0.0 Tue Sep 26 20:56:00 MST 2000
      - Fkey interface revamped. Now each foreign key has a raw
        interface that accesses the values as stored in the DB, and an
        object oriented interface that retrieves an object of foreign
        class. This also obsoleted many of the old confusing flags to
        new(), such as:  'no_fkey_objects', 'recursive_fetch',
        'fetch_fkey_fkeys', and 'fetch_otm_fkeys'	 
      - application startup time is much quicker. Classes no longer
        declare 'use' pragmas for all fkeys.
      - created data directory where XML versions of some tables are
        stored: external_database, and controlled vocabularies.
      - also all MANY_TO_ONE fkeys now leave methods in the calling
        class, for example 'spc_fk' in Chromosome. This provides both
        parent and child links to DB objects in MANY_TO_ONE
        relationships.
      - xml-write now has friendlier command line option interface
      - all internal methods now have better DBI error messages
      - get_objects() no longer returns bogus objects.
      - new example script: list_tables.pl that is the main entry
        point from browsing the DB, table-by-table
      - example cgi scripts are now only installed during 'make
        install'
      - more example scripts for using XML to insert data into the
        DB: cv-insert.pl, contact-insert.pl, security-insert.pl 

1.0.5 Fri Sep 22 19:41:44 MST 2000
      - Bug fix for xml-write: if USF/CSF entries not present, no
        external_file reference is created.
      - Bug fix for make process: cgi scripts are now installed in
        $CGDIR only during 'make install'
      - minor bug fixes for entire make process, and general cleanup
        of Makefile.PL

1.0.4 Wed Sep 20 14:50:41 MST 2000
      - Fixed linking table bug that caused only a single entry to be
        retrieved for any fkey access.
      - Final version of xml-write.pl. Species can now be specified by
        comma-delimited list (--species=4,5,6), as can
        experiments. New option for limiting what arrays are output by
        specifying array type
        (--am-types=primary_raw,derived_ratio). New tables supported
        include GroupSec, TL_FactorValues, Treatment_AMs, Sample, and
        Citation.  

1.0.3 Sat Sep 16 14:18:02 MST 2000
      - Bug fix in create_genex_class.pl for linking tables
	 ==> %TABLE2PKEY was improperly generated
      - moved DTD's into distribution
      - new scripts directory
      - Makefile.PL has nicer interface
      - numerous additions to xml-write: control bundle can now
	include all contacts in DB, info has been normalized between
	<array> and <array_measurement>, <citation> support added,
	controlled vocab terms no longer use white-space, 

1.0.2 Thu Sep  7 17:00:58 MST 2000
      - created scripts directory
      - moved assert_element() to XMLUtils.pm
      - more refinements to xml-write.pl

     - new controlled vocab tables

0.27 Thu Jun 15 15:20:15 MDT 2000
     - changed interface to get_objects(), it now accepts an optional
       hashref as the first parameter,

0.26 Tue Jun 13 15:24:07 MDT 2000
     - Fixed CACHE bug in Makefile.PL
     - added xml-write.pl.in, write-con-vocab.pl.in, and pretty-print.pl.in

0.25 Tue Jun 13 13:37:07 MDT 2000
     - removed %%GENEX-EXTRALIBS%% this broke make test because the
       use 'lib' made perl find those libs *before* the new ones in
       blib. 

0.20 Tue Jun  6 16:57:40 MDT 2000
     - DBUtils.pm: Moved all functions in @EXPORT to @EXPORT_OK.
       Added fetch_fkey_list().
       Added caching to assert_table_defined() ==> much faster for
	repetitive asserts.
     - Genex.pm: undefined() handles fetching fkeys as objects.
     - All classes: new fkey type: LOOKUP_TABLE fkeys.
	delayed_fetch flag is gone, instead it works by default
	Added fkey_objects, fetch_all, fetch_fkey_fkeys, fetch_lt_fkeys,

	   BlastHits.pm
     - fetch_es.pl: Added security check to make sure that CGI
        parameters haven't been modified. 
        Now use filtering on technology types. Had to add DISTINCT flag
        to select statement, and prepend table name to columns requested.  
     - fetch_array.pl: Added security check to make sure that CGI
	parameters haven't been modified.
     - fetch_spot.pl.in: Added security check to make sure that CGI
	parameters haven't been modified.
     - query-intro.pl.in: Technology types are now fetched from
       DB. Values are now sorted so defaults come to the top. 
     - DBUtils.pm.in: Added a DISTINCT option to create_select_sql(). 

0.18 Wed May 31 16:34:48 MDT 2000
     - DBUtils.pm.in: Added three new helper functions: 
	   fetch_es_ids -- gets a list of all available experiment set ids
	      from the DB.
	   fetch_am_ids -- gets a list of all available array measurement
	       ids for a given experiment from the DB.
	   output_spot_data -- writes all spot data for a given experiment
	       set to a filehandle.

0.17 Fri May 26 16:34:48 MDT 2000
     - added fetch_spot.pl for retrieval of spot data in downloadable
       tab delimited files
     - Added ONLY_ONE_ES parameter to enable a generic interface to
       the combination of query-intro.pl/fetch_es.pl/fetch_array.pl
     - query-intro.pl can now filter on species
     - fetch_es.pl can now filter on array type
     - HTMLUtils::post_process() now filters out logins and passwords 
     - All objects can be called in a recursive fetch mode. If fetch
       is called with a numeric parameter (e.g. $array->fetch(2)),
       that parameter is used to specify the depth of the recursive
       fetch -- this is used for following fkeys. 
     - renamed mksub.pl to create_genex_class.pl
     - Added classes:
               Spotter.pm
               Software.pm
               Scanner.pm
               Sample.pm
               Protocol.pm
               ExperimentSet.pm
               ArrayMeasurement.pm
               ArrayLayout.pm

0.16 Tue May 23 13:51:28 MDT 2000
     - fixed dangerous problem with caching the current database
       handle => calling disconnect() didn't undefine the handle,
       just removed the backend connection. 
     - fixed dangerous bug in Bio::Genex::undefined()
     - fixed grammar bug in cgi scripts

0.15 Mon May 22 16:58:30 MDT 2000
