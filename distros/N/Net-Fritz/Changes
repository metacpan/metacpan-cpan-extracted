Revision history for perl distribution Net::Fritz

v0.0.9 2017-07-20

 - Use SSL communication by default.  If this makes any problems,
   please let me know so I can revert the change in the next version
   (or better yet: fix the bug).
   In case of problems, call Net::Fritz::Box->new with
   upnp_url => 'http://fritz.box:49000' to revert to the old behaviour.
 - Net::Fritz::Box->new( configfile => 0) will now check multiple
   locations for the default configuration file, see
   Net::Fritz::ConfigFile for details
 - various documentation fixes

v0.0.8 2017-07-08

 - Net::Fritz::Box::new() can parse a configuration file where you can
   store the username and password to log into your FRITZ!Box
 - new convenience methods that reduce boilerplate code:
   - Net::Fritz::Box::call()
   - Net::Fritz::Device::call()
 - various documentation fixes

v0.0.7 2017-06-14

 - next try to fix XML::Simple related bugs during test execution,
   this time by forcing XML::Simple to use XML::Parser
   (still can't reproduce locally, need the tester infrastructure
    to pick up a new released version)

v0.0.6 2017-06-12

 - try to fix XML::Simple related bugs during test execution
   where parse_string() gets something that looks more like a file

    CPAN test reports show about 0.5% error rate)
