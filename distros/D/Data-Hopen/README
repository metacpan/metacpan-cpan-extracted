NAME
    Data::Hopen - A build generator with first-class edges and explicit
    dependencies

    hopen is a cross-platform software build generator.  It makes files you
    can pass to Make, Ninja, Visual Studio, or other build tools, to compile
    and link your software.  hopen gives you:

    *   A full, Turing-complete, robust programming language to write your
        build scripts (specifically, Perl 5.14+)

    *   No hidden magic!  All your data is visible and accessible in a build
        graph.

    *   Context-sensitivity.  Your users can tweak their own builds for their
        own platforms without affecting your project.

    See Data::Hopen::Conventions for details of the input format.

    Why Perl?  Because (1) you probably already have it installed, and (2) it
    is the original write-once, run-everywhere language!

INSTALLATION
    Easiest: install "cpanminus" if you don't have it - see
    <https://metacpan.org/pod/App::cpanminus#INSTALLATION>.  Then run "cpanm
    Data::Hopen".

    Manually: clone or untar into a working directory.  Then, in that
    directory,

        perl Makefile.PL
        make
        make test

    (you may need to install dependencies as well - see
    <https://www.cpan.org/modules/INSTALL.html> for resources).  If all the
    tests pass,

        make install

    If some of the tests fail, please check the issues and file a new one if
    no one else has reported the problem yet.
