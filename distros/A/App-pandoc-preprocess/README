NAME
    App::pandoc::preprocess - Preprocess Pandoc before Processing Pandoc

VERSION
    version v0.9.10

ppp - pandoc pre-process
USAGE
         cat chapters/input-*.pandoc | ppp | pandoc -o output.pdf --smart [more pandoc options...]

    Additionally see `etc/input.txt` for concrete examples.

PREREQUISITES
    *   dot/neato (neato is new!)

    *   rdfdot

    *   ditaa

    *   Image::Magick (for downscaling of large images)

BACKGROUND
    *   much simpler design than version 1: pipeable & chainable, reading
        line-by-line

    *   parallelized work on image file creation

  How it works
    1. while-loop will iterate line by line and is using the
    flip-flop-operator:

         * as soon, as a ditaa/rdfdot/dot-block starts,
           globals ($fileno, $outfile, etc) are set, so all other routines can see them
         * when actually *inside* the block, the block's contents are printed
           to the newly generated file (image-X.(ditaa/rdfdot/dot))

    2. once the flip-flop-operator hits the end of the
    ditaa/rdfdot/dot-block, a child will be spawned to take over the actual
    ditaa/rdfdot/dot-process to create the png-file and the globals are
    reset

    3. all other lines which are not part of a ditaa/rdfdot/dot-block will
    simply be piped through to stdout

    4. at the end of the program, all children are waited for

    5. in the meantime, the new pandoc contents are printed to stdout

    6. all child-processes will remain quiert as far as stdout is concerned
    and write to their individual log-files

  Todo
    *   Captions

    *   Checks whether ditaa... are available

    *   check whether ditaa has file.encoding set

    *   bundle ditaa with this
