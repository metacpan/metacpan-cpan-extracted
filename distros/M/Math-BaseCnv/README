NAME
    Math::BaseCnv - basic functions to CoNVert between number Bases

VERSION
    This documentation refers to version 1.14 of Math::BaseCnv, which was
    released on Sat Jul 30 06:44:28:46 -0500 2016.

SYNOPSIS
      #!/usr/bin/perl
      use strict;use warnings;use utf8;use v5.10;use Math::BaseCnv;

                  # CoNVert     63 from base-10 (decimal) to base- 2 (binary )
      my $binary__63 = cnv(     63 , 10,  2 );
                  # CoNVert 111111 from base- 2 (binary ) to base-16 (HEX    )
      my $HEX_____63 = cnv( 111111 ,  2, 16 );
                  # CoNVert     3F from base-16 (HEX    ) to base-10 (decimal)
      my $decimal_63 = cnv(    '3F', 16, 10 );
      say "63 dec->bin $binary__63 bin->HEX $HEX_____63 HEX->dec $decimal_63";

DESCRIPTION
    BaseCnv provides a few simple functions for converting between arbitrary
    number bases. You're probably better off using Michael Robinton's
    Math::Base::Convert benchmarked high-performance Perl modules. Another
    object syntax for number-base conversion is Ken Williams' fine
    Math::BaseCalc module.

PURPOSE
    The reason I created BaseCnv was that I needed a simple way to convert
    quickly between the 3 number bases I use most (10, 16, and 64). It
    turned out that it was trivial to handle any arbitrary number base that
    is represented as characters. High-bit ASCII has proven somewhat
    problemmatic but at least BaseCnv can simply and reliably convert
    between any possible base between 2 and 64 (or 96). I'm happy with it
    and employ b64() in places I probably shouldn't now.

USAGE
  cnv($numb[,$from[,$tobs]])
    CoNVert the number contained in $numb from its current number base
    ($from) into the result number base ($tobs).

    When only $numb is provided as a parameter:

    If $numb only contains valid decimal (base 10) digits, it will be
    converted to HEXADECIMAL (base 16).

    If $numb only contains valid hexadecimal (base 16) digits or begins with
    '0x', it will be it will be converted to decimal (base 10).

    When only $numb and $from are provided as parameters:

    cnv() assumes that $numb is already in decimal format and uses $from as
    the $tobs.

    When all three parameters are provided:

    The normal (and most clear) usage of cnv() is to provide all three
    parameters where $numb is converted from $from base to $tobs.

    cnv() is the only function that is exported from a normal 'use
    Math::BaseCnv;' command. The other functions below can be imported to
    local namespaces explicitly or with the following tags:

      :all - every function described here
      :heX - only cnv(), dec(), heX(), and HEX()
      :b64 - only cnv(), b10(), b64(), and b64sort()
      :dig - only dig() and diginit()
      :sfc - only summ(), fact(), and choo()

  b10($b64n)
    A shortcut to convert the number given as a parameter ($b64n) from base
    64 to decimal (base 10).

  b64($b10n)
    A shortcut to convert the number given as a parameter ($b10n) from
    decimal (base 10) to base 64.

  b64sort(@b64s)
    A way to sort b64 strings as though they were decimal numbers.

  dec($b16n)
    A shortcut to convert the number given as a parameter ($b16n) from
    hexadecimal (base 16) to decimal (base 10).

  HEX($b10n)
    A shortcut to convert the number given as a parameter ($b10n) from
    decimal (base 10) to HEXADECIMAL (base 16) uppercase.

  heX($b10n)
    A shortcut to convert the number given as a parameter ($b10n) from
    decimal (base 10) to hexadecimal (base 16) lowercase.

    Please read the "NOTES" regarding heX().

  dig(\@newd)
    Assign the new digit character list to be used in place of the default
    one. dig() can also alternately accept a string name matching one of the
    following predefined digit sets:

      'bin' => ['0', '1'],
      'dna' => ['a', 'c', 'g', 't'],
      'DNA' => ['A', 'C', 'G', 'T'],
      'oct' => ['0'..'7'],
      'dec' => ['0'..'9'],
      'heX' => ['0'..'9', 'a'..'f'],
      'HEX' => ['0'..'9', 'A'..'F'],
      'b36' => ['0'..'9', 'a'..'z'],
      'B36' => ['0'..'9', 'A'..'Z'],
      'b62' => ['0'..'9', 'a'..'z', 'A'..'Z'],
      'b64' => ['0'..'9', 'A'..'Z', 'a'..'z', '.', '_'], # month:C:12 day:V:31
      'm64' => ['A'..'Z', 'a'..'z', '0'..'9', '+', '/'], # 0-63 from MIME::Base64
      'iru' => ['A'..'Z', 'a'..'z', '0'..'9', '[', ']'], # P10 server-server protocol used by IRCu daemon
      'url' => ['A'..'Z', 'a'..'z', '0'..'9', '-', '_'], # MIME::Base64::URLSafe (avoid %2B %2F expansions)
      'rgx' => ['A'..'Z', 'a'..'z', '0'..'9', '!', '-'], # ReGular eXpression variant
      'id0' => ['A'..'Z', 'a'..'z', '0'..'9', '_', '-'], # IDentifier style 0
      'id1' => ['A'..'Z', 'a'..'z', '0'..'9', '.', '_'], # IDentifier style 1
      'xnt' => ['A'..'Z', 'a'..'z', '0'..'9', '.', '-'], # XML Name Tokens (Nmtoken)
      'xid' => ['A'..'Z', 'a'..'z', '0'..'9', '_', ':'], # XML identifiers (Name   )
      'sxl' => ['?', '@', 'A'..'Z', '[','\\', ']', '^',  # Sixel Base64 from VT100.Net
                '_', '`', 'a'..'z', '{', '|', '}', '~'],
      'b85' => ['0'..'9', 'A'..'Z', 'a'..'z', '!', '#',  # RFC 1924 for IPv6 addresses like in Math::Base85
                '$', '%', '&', '(', ')', '*', '+', '-',
                ';', '<', '=', '>', '?', '@', '^', '_',
                '`', '{', '|', '}', '~'               ],
      'asc' => [' ', '!', '"', '#', '$', '%', '&', "'",  # Base96 7-bit printable 0x20 (space) - 0x7F
                '(', ')', '*', '+', ',', '-', '.', '/',  #   (tilde ~) 'ascii' from Math::Base::Convert
                '0'..'9', ':', ';', '<', '=', '>', '?',
                '@', 'A'..'Z', '[','\\', ']', '^', '_',
                '`', 'a'..'z', '{', '|', '}', '~'     ],
      'b96' => ['0'..'9', 'A'..'Z', 'a'..'z', '.', '_',  # Base96 but starting with b64 characters
                ' ', '!', '"', '#', '$', '%', '&', "'",
                '(', ')', '*', '+', ',', '-', '/', ':',
                ';', '<', '=', '>', '?', '@', '[','\\',
                ']', '^', '`', '{', '|', '}', '~'     ],

    If no \@newd list or digit set name is provided as a parameter, dig()
    returns the current character list. It's fine to have many more
    characters in your current digit set than will be used with your
    conversions (e.g., using dig('b64') works fine for any cnv() call with
    $from and $tobs params less than or equal to 64).

    An example of a \@newd parameter for a specified alternate digit set for
    base 9 conversions is:

      dig( [ qw( n a c h o z   y u m ) ] );

  diginit()
    Resets the used digit list to the initial default order of the
    predefined digit set: 'b64'. This is simply a shortcut for calling
    dig('b64') for reinitialization purposes.

  summ($numb)
    A simple function to calculate a memoized BigInt summation of $numb down
    to 1.

  fact($numb)
    A simple function to calculate a memoized BigInt factorial of $numb.

  choo($ennn, $emmm)
    A simple function to calculate a memoized BigInt function of $ennn
    choose $emmm.

NOTES
    The Perl built-in hex() function takes a hex string as a parameter and
    returns the decimal value (FromBase = 16, ToBase = 10). This notation
    seems counter-intuitive to me since I prefer to read the code as though
    a hex() function will turn your parameter into hexadecimal (i.e., I
    think hex() should hexify your parameter but Perl's built-in does not.).
    I initially decided to invert the notation for my similar functions, but
    reconsidered the potential harm possible by introducing exported
    conflicting opposite behavior into other people's maybe crucial code, so
    I am falling back on unique casing with heX().

    My b64() function takes a decimal number as a parameter and returns the
    base64 equivalent (FromBase = 10, ToBase = 64) and my b10() function
    takes a base64 number (string) and returns the decimal value (FromBase =
    64, ToBase = 10). My heX() function opposes Perl's built-in hex() (which
    is similar to my dec()).

    Please think of my dec() and heX() functions as meaning decify and
    heXify. Also the pronunciation of dec() is 'dess' (not 'deck').

    Error checking is minimal.

    This module does not handle fractional number inputs because I like
    using the dot (.) character as a standard base64 digit since it makes
    for clean filenames.

    summ(), fact(), and choo() are general Math function utilities which are
    unrelated to number-base conversion but I didn't feel like making
    another separate module just for them so they snuck in here.

    I hope you find Math::BaseCnv useful. TTFN.
