NAME
    Dancer::Plugin::Stomp - A Dancer plugin for messaging using STOMP based
    message queues.

VERSION
    version 1.0302

SYNOPSIS
        use Dancer;
        use Dancer::Plugin::Stomp;

        post '/messages' => sub {
            stomp_send { destination => '/queue/foo', body => request->body };
        };

        dance;

DESCRIPTION
    The goal of this module is to make it as easy as possible to interact
    with a STOMP message broker. STOMP stands for Simple (or Streaming) Text
    Orientated Messaging Protocol. It is a simple and standard protocol for
    messaging systems. See <http://stomp.github.com> for more details about
    the protocol.

KEYWORDS
  stomp_send
        stomp_send \%data
        stomp_send name => \%data

    This is a convenience function that handles connection details for you.
    It sends your message using the default configured client. If you have
    only one client configured, it is your default one. If you have multiple
    clients configured, the one named "default" will be used. Doing this

        stomp_send { destination => '/queue/foo', body => 'hello' };

    is the same as:

        my $stomp = stomp();
        $stomp->connect(login => $login, passcode => $passcode);
        $stomp->send(destination => '/queue/foo', body => 'hello');
        $stomp->disconnect();

    If you have multiple clients configured, you can distinguish between
    them by providing the name of the client as the first argument, followed
    by the data as the second argument:

        stomp_send foo => { destination => '/queue/foo', body => 'hello' };

  stomp
        my $stomp = stomp
        my $stomp = stomp $name

    This simply returns a Net::Stomp object. You are responsible for
    connecting and disconnecting. When no arguments are given, it returns a
    handle to the default configured client. You may provide a name if you
    have multiple clients configured.

CONFIGURATION
    Configuration at a minimum requires a name and a host. The following
    example defines one client named "default".

        plugins:
          Stomp:
            default:
              hostname: foo.com
              port: 61613

    Multiple clients can also be configured:

        plugins:
          Stomp:
            default:
              hostname: foo.com
              port: 61613
            bar:
              hostname: bar.com
              port: 61613
              login: bob
              passcode: secret

    Failover hosts are supported:

        plugins:
          Stomp:
            default:
              hosts:
                -
                  hostname: foo.com
                  port: 61613
                -
                  hostname: bar.com
                  port: 61613

    The available configuration options for a client are:

    hostname
        This is the location of the STOMP server. It can be an ip address or
        a hostname. Either hostname or hosts is required.

    hosts
        This is to support failover hosts as documented in Net::Stomp. In
        Perl terms, it should be an arrayref of hashrefs, each of which
        contains at least a hostname and a port. Either hostname or hosts is
        required.

    port
    login
    passcode
