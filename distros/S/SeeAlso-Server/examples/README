This directory contains some examples of services based on the SeeAlso-Module.

You can directly run the scripts if SeeAlso is installed in your PERL library 
path (@INC) or if the 'lib' directory of SeeAlso is a subdirectory of this
example directory (on Unix just create a symlink with "ln -s ../lib/ lib").
