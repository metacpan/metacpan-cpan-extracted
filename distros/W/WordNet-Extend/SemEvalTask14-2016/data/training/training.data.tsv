The marker itself may be a part of a gene or may have no known function.	http://www.genome.gov/glossary/index.cfm?id=455
LOD Score	noun	withdef.70	LOD stands for "logarithm of the odds." In genetics, the LOD score is a statistical estimate of whether two genes, or a gene and a disease gene, are likely to be located near each other on a chromosome and are therefore likely to be inherited. A LOD score of 3 or higher is generally understood to mean that two genes are located close to each other on the chromosome. In terms of significance, a LOD score of 3 means the odds are a thousand to one that the two genes are linked, and therefore inherited together.	http://www.genome.gov/glossary/index.cfm?id=531
DNA Fingerprinting	noun	withdef.71	DNA fingerprinting is a laboratory technique used to establish a link between biological evidence and a suspect in a criminal investigation. A DNA sample taken from a crime scene is compared with a DNA sample from a suspect. If the two DNA profiles are a match, then the evidence came from that suspect.

Plots of residuals can reveal computational errors in linear regression, as well as conditions under which linear regression is inappropriate, such as nonlinearity and heteroscedasticity. If linear regression is performed properly, the sum of the residuals from the regression line must be zero; otherwise, there is a computational error somewhere.	http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~stark/SticiGui/Text/gloss.htm
Two-Sided Test	noun	withdef.132	A two-sided test is a statistical hypothesis test in which the values for which we can reject the null hypothesis, H0 are located in both tails of the probability distribution. In other words, the critical region for a two-sided test is the set of values less than a first critical value of the test and the set of values greater than a second critical value of the test. A two-sided test is also referred to as a two-tailed test of significance.	http://www.stats.gla.ac.uk/steps/glossary/probability.html

slant	noun	withdef.183	A receiver route. In the slant route, a receiver runs straight upfield a few yards, plants his outside foot hard while in full stride, and turns 45 degrees towards the quarterback. A staple of the West Coast Offense (WCO) and the player may go as little as 2 yards or as many as 6 yards before moving inside for the pass. Variations include the quick slant in which the player plants and turns at the snap instead of running ahead first and the Slow or Zone route, in which the receiver runs 10 to 15 yards downfield to get behind the linebackers before turning.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_American_football
