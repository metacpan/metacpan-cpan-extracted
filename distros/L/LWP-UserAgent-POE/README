NAME
    LWP::UserAgent::POE - Drop-in LWP::UserAgent replacement in POE
    environments

SYNOPSIS
        use LWP::UserAgent::POE;

        my $ua = LWP::UserAgent::POE->new();

          # The following command looks (and behaves) like it's blocking, 
          # but it actually keeps the POE kernel ticking and processing 
          # other tasks. post() and request() work as well.
        my $resp = $ua->get( "http://www.yahoo.com" );

        if($resp->is_success()) {
            print $resp->content();
        } else {
            print "Error: ", $resp->message(), "\n";
        }

        POE::Kernel->run();

DESCRIPTION
    LWP::UserAgent::POE is a subclass of LWP::UserAgent and works well in a
    POE environment. It is a drop-in replacement for LWP::UserAgent in
    systems that are already using LWP::UserAgent synchronously and want to
    play nicely with POE.

    The problem: LWP::UserAgent by itself is synchronous and blocks on
    requests until the response from the network trickles in. This is
    unacceptable in POE, as the POE kernel needs to continue processing
    other tasks until the HTTP response arrives.

    LWP::UserAgent::POE to the rescue. Its request() method and all related
    methods like get(), post() etc. work just like in the original. But if
    you peek under the hood, they're sending a request to a running
    POE::Component::Client::HTTP component and return a valid $response
    object when a response from the network is available. Although the
    program flow seems to be blocked, it's not. LWP::UserAgent::POE works
    the magic behind the scenes to keep the POE kernel ticking and process
    other tasks.

    The net effect is that you can use LWP::UserAgent::POE just like
    LWP::UserAgent in a seemingly synchronous way.

    Note that this module is not a POE component. Instead, it is a subclass
    of LWP::UserAgent. It is self-contained, it even spawns the
    POE::Component::Client::HTTP component in its constructor unless there's
    one already running that has been started by another instance.

  Cookies and other features
    Just like LWP::UserAgent, LWP::UserAgent::POE supports cookies if you
    define a cookie jar:

       my $ua = LWP::UserAgent::POE->new(
           cookie_jar => HTTP::Cookies->new(),
       );

    Just make sure to pass these parameters to the constructor, see the
    'Bugs' section below on what hasn't been implemented yet.

  Bugs
    Currently, you can't call LWP::UserAgent's parameter methods, like

        $ua->timeout();

    as this won't be propagated to the POE component running the HTTP
    requests. It might be added later. Currently, you have to add it to the
    constructor, like

        my $ua = LWP::UserAgent->new( timeout => 10 );

    to take effect. LWP::UserAgent::POE translates the LWP::UserAgent
    parameter names to POE::Component::Client::HTTP's parameters, which are
    slightly different.
