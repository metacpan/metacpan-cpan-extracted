Statistics-Distributions-Ancova version 0.32.2

    A perl implementation of One-Way Analysis of Covariance for Independent Samples. As with paired t-test and repeated-measures ANOVA this test
    removes the obscuring effects of pre-existing individual differences among subjects. In cases where a substantial portion of the variability 
    that occurs within each of the set of a dependent variable Y is actually covariance with another concomitant variable X measures, this test
    removes the covariance with X from Y thus removing a portion of the irrelevant variability of individual differences. 

    See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_of_covariance for more info.
