Mozilla::DOM::Supports

=for object Mozilla::DOM::Supports

Mozilla::DOM::Supports is a wrapper around an instance of Mozilla's
nsISupports interface, from which everything else inherits.

This is how you can get different interfaces from
an object. Basically that means a way to get different
methods from the same object.

The $obj return value will be blessed into the class corresponding to
whatever interface you requested.

The $uuid argument is just a string which looks something like

  {69e5df00-7b8b-11d3-af61-00a024ffc08c}

which you can find in the Mozilla header files, but it's
better to use a GetIID class method, like

  $uuid = Mozilla::DOM::EventTarget->GetIID();
