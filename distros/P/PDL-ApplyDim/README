NAME

    PDL::ApplyDim - shuffle before and after applying function

SYNOPSIS

        use PDL;
        use PDL::ApplyDim;
        my $nd=sequence(3,3);
        sub mult_columns($x, $dx, $m) { # multiply some columns of $x by $m
            $x->slice("0:-1:$dx")*=$m;
        }
        say $nd->apply_to(\&mult_columns, 1, 2, 3); #multiply even rows of $nd by 3
        say $nd->apply_not_to(\&mult_columns,0,2,3);# same

DESCRIPTION

    Many operations in PDL act on the first dimension, so a very common
    idiom is

        $pdl->mv($dim,0)->function($some, $extra, $args)->mv(0, $dim);

    to move the dimension $dim to the front, operate with the function and
    the move the dimension back to its original place. The idea is to hide
    the mv operations and write this as

        $pdl->apply_to(\&function, $dim, $some, $extra, $args);

    or

        apply_to($pdl, "function", $dim, $some, $extra, $args);

    Similarly

        $pdl->apply_not_to(\&function, $dim, $some, $extra, $args);

    moves the dimension to the back.

    Besides a number, $dim may also be an array reference, such as as
    =[$d0, $d1...], to move the dimensions $d0, $d1... to the front or to
    the back instead of just a single dimension.

METHODS

 apply_to($code, $dim, @extra_args)

    Applies $code to an ndarray after moving dimension $dim to the front,
    and then bringing the dimension back to its original position. Code can
    be a string naming a PDL function or a reference to a subroutine that
    acts on an ndarray. It may take extra arguments. If <$dim> is an array
    reference, moves several dimensions.

 apply_not_to($code, $dim, @extra_args)

    Applies <$code> to an ndarray after moving dimension $dim to the end,
    and then bringing the dimension back to its original position. Code can
    be a string naming a PDL function or a reference to a subroutine that
    acts on an ndarray. It may take extra arguments. If <$dim> is an array
    reference, moves several dimensions.
