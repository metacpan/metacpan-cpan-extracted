BlueCoat-SGOS

This is the BlueCoat::SGOS module.  It seeks to parse
the configuration of a Blue Coat SGOS device.  It was
formerly Net::BlueCoat::SGOS.


** WARNING 
This is currently beta-quality software.  This means:
+ there could be bugs
+ the API is not stable

It has been tested on a handful of sysinfo files with great
success.

Because sysinfo data is semi-unstructured, this module
reads everything into memory and splits it apart
at each "delimiter" section.  This is inefficient
and slow.
