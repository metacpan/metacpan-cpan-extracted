=head1 Changes in the 3.1 release

=head2 Remove support for DB2 releases prior to V8.2

Support for DB2 releases V7.2 and V8.1 has been dropped.

=head2 Improve support for Windows

Mike O'Reilly gracefully and patiently pointed out a number of
Unix-specific assumptions that have to be corrected to compile the
module with ActiveState Perl 5.8.8 for 32-bit and 64-bit Windows.

Most of these affect device and filenames

=head2 Add database manager configuration parameters for V9.7

Add the new DB2 V9.7 configuration parameters, most of which are
SSL-related.

=head2 Generate constants locally

The C<db2_constants.pl> file translates DB2 constants from symbolic
names to numeric values.  Previous releases generated the file when
the package was created for distribution; the file will now be
generated locally as part of the build process.  This is necessary
because IBM changes the value of some constants in an incompatible
manner; so a file generated for V9.5 will not work with V8.2.

=head2 ListUtilities fix

The C<ListUtilities> method now supports the C<Version> parameter.

=head1 Changes in the 3.0 release

=head2 Backup

Add support for the Backup command, including support for DPF backups
(with included logs) in DB2 V9.5.

=head1 Changes in the 2.9 release

=head2 Fix core dump in load from cursor

A second bug in the db2Load command, caused a load from cursor (source
type "Statement") to perform an invalid free, sometimes leading to a
core dump. Now fixed.  Have run valgrind on import/export/load to
verify no additional mistakes are present.

=head1 Changes in the 2.8 release

=head2 Fix core dump in load from cursor

A bug in the db2Load command, introduced in the 2.7 release, caused a
load from cursor (source type "Statement") to dump core. Now fixed.

=head2 BugFix in Load / Import

A bug in the Load and Import methods prevented load/import operations
against mixed-case schema and table names (which have to be
double-quoted when passed to DB2).  Now fixed.

=head2 Add the 'ReOpt' option to the Rebind method

The re-optimization level can now be set at Rebind time.

=head1 Changes in the 2.7 release

=head2 Rename module to DB2::Admin

The modules/classes have been renamed from DB2API to DB2::Admin as
recommended by Tim Bunce.

=head2 Add "list of files" support for Load of DEL files

The Load method now supports loading a list of DEL files in a single
command.

=head2 Support new protocol, types for node directory

Support the TCP/IP v4, TCP/IP v6 and TCP/IP v4 using SOCKS protocol
types for the node directory methods.

=head1 Changes in the 2.6 release

=head2 Add XML support to Export, Import and Load methods

The Export, Import and Load methods now supports the XML options
introduced in DB2 V9.1 (Export, Import) and DB2 V9.5 (Load).  Note
that the schema-related XML validate / default / ignore / map options
are not supported at this time.

=head2 Add connect attributes

Allow the user to specify the program name and connect time-out as
connect attributes.  Default options can be set with
C<SetConnectAttributes> and per-connect options can be specified with
the C<ConnectAttr> parameter to the C<Connect> method.

The default program name is no longer C<perl> or C<perl5.8>, but the
script name (the basename of C<$0>).

=head1 Changes in the 2.5 release

=head2 Add the NoCharDel option for the import and load commands

The NoCharDel option, which is used to handle files where character
strings have no delimiters, is now supported for FileOptions
parameters of the the Import and Load methods.  It was already
supported for the Import method.

=head2 Support "Update Profile Only" for Runstats

The implementation of the runstats API contained a bug that made
"update profile only" not work.  This was due to an discrepancy
between the documented constant name in the IBM documentation
(DB2RUNSTATS_UPDATE_PROFILE_ONLY) and the actual #define
(DB2RUNSTATS_UPDA_PROFILE_ONLY), missing the letters TE from the
middle.

The code now handles both cases

=head2 Fine-tune error handling

The error handling now differentiates between errors and warnings.
The default behavior is unchanged - error messages are printed for
errors and warnings, and no exception is thrown.  However, the
'RaiseError' option now only throws exceptions for errors, not
warnings - the new 'RaiseWarn' option handles the latter.

=head2 Support the ExcludingXML option for the Runstats command

The new DB2RUNSTATS_EXCLUDING_XML flag for the db2Runstats API is now
supported as the ExcludingXML option.

=head2 Support the CodePage file type modifier

The Export, Import, and Load commands now support the CodePage file
type modifier.  The Load command claimed to support this before,. but
the implementation was incorrect.

=head2 Rename the system admin group constants

The SysAdm, SysMaint, SysCtrl and SysMon group instance configuration
parameters (SQLF_KTN_xxx_GROUP) were limited to 16 characters in DB2
V8.1 and before.  With DB2 V8.2, new configuration parameters were
introduced that changed this limit to 30, but had a different name:
SQLF_KTN_xxx_GRP.  However, the documentation hides this difference
and refers to the new parameters by the old name.

DB2 V9.1 introduces a bug in the handling of the old parameters.  In
order to work around this, the new parameters now override the old
ones in the parse_constants script.  So in DB2 V8.2 and above, the old
names (e.g. 'sysadm_group') can be used and do the right thing by
using the new constants.

=head1 Changes in the 2.4 release

=head2 Changes in db2CfgGet / db2CfgSet for V9.1

The get/update instance/database configuration parameters methods have
new flags for DB2 V9.1: 'Computed' (get/set) and 'Manual' (set).  Add
support for these new flags.

The only value that supports 'Computed' as far as I am aware, is
'database_memory'.  When the Command Line Processor reports it as
'computed', the admin API can now do the same.

The 'Manual' option allow you to turn off automatic management for
parameters while DB2 maintains the last automatically set value.

=head2 Support for new format IP v4 for datastream elements

When IP v4 clients running DB2 V9.1 connect to a database, the
application id has a new format and includes the IP address and port
in plain text.  Support this new format and straighten out the
existing IP v4 format so it is now always "<address> port <port>".

=head1 Changes in the 2.3 release

=head2 Changes in db2Load API for V9.1

On DB2 V9.1, use the "iSetIntegrityPending" field for the db2Load API
instead of the "iCheckPending" field.

=head2 IP v6 support for datastream elements

Support IP v6 addresses for the application-id in snapshot and
event monitor data elements (untested)

=head2 Add new instance and database configuration parameters for V9.1

The following database manager and database configuration parameters
are new for DB2 V9.1 and have been added:

=over 4

=item federated_async

=item fcm_num_channels

=item self_tuning_mem

=item db_mem_thresh

=item db_collname

=item restrict_access

=back

=head1 Changes in the 2.2 release

=head2 Add basic support for DB2 V9.1

The module now compiles on DB2 V9.1.  No new features are supported,
but the makefiles and various utility scripts have been adjusted and
compile issues fixed.

No support has been added for new instance / database configuration
parameters or for the new XML-related features of db2Import and
db2Export.

=head2 Add ClientInfo method

A new ClientInfo method can be used to get/set the TPM client
information (sqleseti, sqleqryi).

=head1 Changes in the 2.1 release

=head2 Add DPF options to the Load command

Various DPF-related options for the Load command are now supported.
In addition, a more detailed second return value describes the DPF
aspects of the load, including each agent, in detail.

=head1 Changes in the 2.0 release

=head2 Add LOB support to the Export, Import and Load methods

Support for the LobPath, LobFile and LobsInFile options of the Export,
Import and Load methods has been added.  (LobFile is Export specific.)

=head2 Add the 'DelPriorityChar' option 

Support for the 'DelPriorityChar' option for the DEL file type
modifiers of Import/Load now supports data files with embedded
newlines in column values.

=head2 Support the DB2 V8.2 FP9 enhanced deadlock event monitor

The enhanced deadlock event monitor in DB2 V8.2.2 (FP9) writes a new
type of monitoring element, called 'handle' (but really a blob).

Support to decode this has been added (the data is returned as a
hexadecimal string).

=head1 Changes in the 1.9 release

=head2 Fix bugs in Load option handling

The XS code was handling load options incorrectly, leading the
'NonRecoverable' flag to set the "HoldQuiesce" flag instead, and
leading the "Allow Read Access" flag to set the IndexingMode to
"rebuild".

=head2 Support the SQLM_HEAP_xx constants

The various constants for database manager, database and application
pool ids are now supported.  Previously, a numeric code was displayed.

=head1 Changes in the 1.8 release

=head2 Support fork()ing programs

The XS code now detects a fork() has occurred and will mark as closed
database connections opened by the parent.  This requires some care,
as closing the connection in the child will affect the connections in
the parent.  And, of course, IBM doesn't properly document this.

=head2 Handle cross-partition connection names

The code parsing connection names got cross-DPF node connections wrong
and spewed out large amounts of "unitialized value" warnings.  Now
corrected.

=head1 Changes in the 1.7 release

=head2 Support the ReorgStatus constants

The reorg status constants returned by database snapshots are now
supported.  Previously, a numeric code was displayed.

=head2 Support the HADR constants

The HADR-related constants returned by database snapshots (HADR role,
state, syncmode, connection status) are now supported.  Previously, a
numeric code was displayed.

=head1 Changes in the 1.6 release

=head2 Bugfix for Runstats method

Bugfix for the 'Runstats' method: you can now collect index statistics
using a previously set profile without collecting/updating column
statistics.

=head2 Bugfix for Runstats, Rebind methods

Bugfix for the 'Runstats' and 'Rebind' methods: the low-level
administrative API functions used to implement these methods ignore
the connection-level auto-commit flag.  This means they will continue
to hold locks on the catalog until an explicit commit or disconnect is
issued.

Both methods now explicitly issue a commit (whether the low-level call
succeeded or not).

=head2 Support 'TempFilesPath' for Load method

A new 'TempFilesPath' parameter for the Load method allows users to
specify the pathname for load temporary files.

=head1 Changes in the 1.5 release

=head2 Add Runstats method

A new 'Runstats' method can be used to collect table and index
statistics.  Only a subset of options is supported; specifically, the
column distribution options and column group features are not
supported.  This may change in future releases. This method requires
DB2 V8.

=head2 Minor Load FileOptions changes

Minor changes to the 'FileOptions' parameter to the 'Load' method: fix
some typos, add 'DumpFileAccessAll', add documentation.

=head2 Bugfix for "load terminate"

The perl and XS code for 'LOAD' got the caller_action wrong; this was
set to SQLU_TERMINATE for a "LOAD TERMINATE", but should always be set
to SQLU_INITIAL.  This removes code and is a Good Thing...

=head2 Add ListUtilities method

A new 'ListUtilities' method supports listing currently active
utilities.  It is implemented using an instance snapshot and requires
DB2 V8.

=head1 Changes in the 1.4 release

=head2 Support exception tables for Load

The Load method now supports the optional 'ExceptionTabe' and
'ExceptionSchema' parameters to set the exception table for load
exceptions.

=head2 Support the 'Utility type' constants

The 'utility type' constants returned by instance snapshots are now
supported.  Previously, a numeric code was displayed.

=head1 Changes in the 1.3 release

=head2 Add more Export options

Add the 'StripZeros', 'DatesISO' and 'DecPlusBlank' options to the
Export file modifiers

=head2 Handle quoting for FileOptions

FileOptions for Import, Export and Load that contain embedded blanks
(e.g. a TimestampFormat like 'MMM D YYY H:M:S') are now quoted before
being fed to the DB2 APIs.

=head2 Add LoadQuery method

A new LoadQuery method allows you to query the progress of a Load
command against a table.

=head1 Changes in the 1.2 release

=head2 Add ListHistory command

A new ListHistory method implements the equivalent of the CLP "List
History" command that allows you to query loads, backups,
rollforwards, etc.

=head2 Make test suite configurable

A CONFIG file is used to drive the test suite, externalizing the names
of the test database, test tables, schema names, etc.

=head1 Changes in the 1.1 release

=head2 Add Load method

New Load method provides an API to the table load functions; only a
subset of features is supported (most notably, partitioned loads,
table hierarchies, TSM media, LOBs and Data Links are not supported).

=head2 Add TargetColumns, InputColumns to Import method

New parameters to the Import method allow specification of the target
columns and selection of the relevant columns from the input file (by
position or DEL files and by name for IXF files).

=head2 Add ImportOptions to Import method

Add import options to the 'Import' method; this allows users to set
commit count, warning count, row count, skip count, etc.  Most options
are available only with DB2 V8.2.

=head1 Changes in the 1.0 release

=head2 Add CatalogDatabase / UncatalogDatabase methods

New methods to catalog a database in the database directory or
uncatalog one.

=head2 Add CatalogNode / UncatalogNode methods

New methods to catalog a node in the node directory or uncatalog one.

=head2 Add CatalogDCSDatabase / UncatalogDCSDatabase methods

New methods to catalog a DCS database in the DCS directory or
uncatalog one.

=head2 Add import/export options for DEL files

The following import options have been added for DEL files:
C<DateFormat>, C<TimeFormat>, C<TimestampFormat>, C<ImpliedDecimal>,
C<StripTBlanks>.

The following export options have been added for DEL files:
C<NoCharDel>, C<TimestampFormat>.

=head2 Use db2Export/db2Import function for export/import

On DB2 V8.2, the new db2Export function is used instead of sqluexpr
and the new db2Import function is used instead of sqluimpr.

=head2 Use db2DbDirXXX functions for GetDatabaseDirectory()

The DatabaseDirectory() method now uses the db2DbDirXXX functions when
available (DB2 V8.2).  For global database directories, this means the
new 'Alternate Hostname' and 'Alternate Port Number' fields are
returned for HADR setups.

=head1 Changes in the 0.9 release

=head2 Add import/export functions

Building on the database connection functions, provide limited table
export/import methods.

=head2 Add database connection functions

New Connect and Disconnect functions allow database connections; this
is implies the database configuration get/set functions can now use
the 'Immediate' option.

=head1 Changes in the 0.8 release

=head2 Add more database manager configuration parameters

All medium/high important updatable database manager configuration
parameters have been added.

=head1 Changes in the 0.7 release

=head2 More value types formatted by DB2API::DataElement

More types of monitor elements are being formatted by the
DB2API::DataElement class.  This includes lock mode, statement
type/operation, server platform, application status.

=head2 DB2API::EventParser more tolerant of unexpected files

The EventParser class warns when it encounters un-expected files.  It
now does not warn for hidden files (dotfiles) that we use internally
to keep track of event file state.

=head1 Changes in the 0.6 release

=head2 Linux/ia64 (Itanium) support

Make the module work on Linux/ia64 (Itanium) and DB2 V8.2.0

=head2 DB2 V8.2 support on Solaris

Make the module work on Solaris 7/8 with DB2 V8.2.0 (32-bit perl only)

=head1 Changes in the 0.5 release

=head2 Accept unknown elements in DB2API::DataStream, DB2API::DataElement

When an unknown monitoring element / even code is found, the decoding
functions now return "(unknown element XXX)" instead of die()ing.

=head2 Convert tests to Test::More

All tests have been converted to the Test::More framework

=head2 Add ForceApplications and ForceAllApplications methods

Two new methods can be used to force selected applications or all
applications.  These should obviously be used with care.

=head2 Add GetDCSDirectory method

A new method allows retrieval of the DCS (gateway) directory

=head2 Change keys in catalog entries

The name of the keys in the GetDatabaseDirectory() and
GetNodeDirectory() methods has been changed to match the (Morgan
Stanley private) reverse-engineered catalog decoding/generation code.

=head2 Support for event files

Add an event file parser module, C<DB2API::EventParser> which can
'tail' growing event files and delete those marked as processed.  A
sample program provides the skeleton for a minimal event monitor.

=head2 More configuration parameter work

The checking script now warns if IBM-internal configuration parameters
are used; more V8.2 configuration parameters have been added.

=head1 Changes in the 0.4 release

=head2 Add additional configuration parameters

A number of additional database and database manager configuration
parameters have been added; this includes support for a 'float' type,
constants used for both the database and the database manager, and a
mechanism to try and deal with configuration parameter names that have
switched to a new constant name and new type between releases.

=head2 Add additional constant categories

Add the 'LockMode' and 'LockObjectType' categories to the
C<DB2API::Constants> C<Lookup> method; use these in the
C<DB2API::DataElement> C<getValue> method.

=head1 Changes in the 0.3 release

=head2 Re-implement self-describing data stream class

The C<DB2API::Elements> class has been replaced by
C<DB2API::DataStream> and C<DB2API::DataElement>, which decode the
information lazily and provide an object-oriented interface to get the
data, including a path search loosely modeled after XPath.

=head2 Add GetDatabaseDirectory and GetNodeDirectory methods to DB2API

These new methods allow retrieval of the database directory and node
directory.

=head2 Database/Dbm Config methods support multiple flags

The database / database manager config methods now support passing in
a single 'Flag' parameter string, or a reference to a hash with
multiple flags.

=head2 Bugfixes and V7 inter-operability fixes

Basically, release 0.2 did not work very well in practice (dealing
with 64-bit values, very slow decoding of snapshot data).  A number of
small fixes were applied to DB2API::Elements to address this.

=head1 Changes in the 0.2 release

=head2 Add UpdateDatabaseConfig method to DB2API

This new method allows updating of database configuration parameters.
Until such time that we support database connections, only delayed
database parameters updates are allowed.

=head2 Add GetDatabaseConfig method to DB2API

This new method allows retrieval of database configuration parameters.
Until such time that we support database connections, only delayed and
default database parameters may be retrieved.

=head2 Add UpdateDbmConfig method to DB2API

This new method allows updating of database manager configuration
parameters.

=head2 Add GetDbmConfig method to DB2API

This new method allows retrieval of database manager configuration
parameters.

=head2 Add GetConfigParam method to DB2API::Constants

This new method allows lookup of meta-data about configuration
parameters.  The API is provisional, as I have not yet decided how to
deal with parameters that change constant name and type between DB2
releases.

=head2 Add <sqlutil.h> to DB2API::Constants

The constants generated are now for both C<sqlmon.h> and C<sqlutil.h>
