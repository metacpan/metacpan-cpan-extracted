NAME
    Module::Notify - trigger a callback when a module is loaded

SYNOPSIS
       use Module::Notify;
   
       Module::Notify->new(Foo => sub { print "2\n" });
   
       # Count to three...
       print "1\n";
       require Foo;
       print "3\n";

DESCRIPTION
    Module::Notify runs callback code when it detects that a particular module
    has been loaded.

  Constructor
    `new($module_name, $callback)`
        Runs the callback when the module is loaded.

        Unlike most OO modules, you can freely use this in void context, and
        it will work fine. However, if you keep the returned reference, you
        can call methods on it:

           my $handle = Module::Notify->new($module, $callback);

        If the module is *already* loaded, runs the callback immediately, and
        returns undef instead of an object.

  Object Methods
    `cancel`
        Cancels the callback.

CAVEATS
    Module::Notify works through an @INC hook. It ought to be the first item
    in @INC and does its best to insert itself as $INC[0] at every opportunity
    it gets.

    If any other path or hook does end up before Module::Notify's @INC hook,
    then any modules loaded via that path or hook will escape Module::Notify's
    notice.
