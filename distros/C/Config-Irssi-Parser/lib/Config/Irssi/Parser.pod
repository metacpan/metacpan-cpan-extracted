=head1 NAME

Config::Irssi::Parser - Yapp-based LALR parser for the irssi config files.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Config::Irssi::Parser;
  my $p = new Config::Irssi::Parser;
  my $hashref = $p->parse(\*STDIN);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This parses an irssi config file into the equivelent perl data structure.
It's quite simple, really.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new(Z<>)

This is a simple constructor that returns a new Config::Irssi::Parser
object.

=head2 parse($fh)

Parser the contents of $fh and return a hashref
of its contents, or undef on failure.


=head1 LIMITATIONS

The current implementation loses all comments and empty lines,
which is in contrast to irssi's own parser which preserves
both comments and empty lines. If anyone has an elegant way of
fixing this, patches are welcome.

=head1 BUGS

There might be issues with backslashes... Quite likely
there are many other bugs.
