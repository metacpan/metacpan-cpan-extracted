NAME
    Plack::Middleware::Throttle::Lite::Backend::Redis - Redis-driven storage
    backend for Throttle-Lite

VERSION
    version 0.04

DESCRIPTION
    This is implemetation of the storage backend for
    Plack::Middleware::Throttle::Lite. It uses redis-server to hold
    throttling data, automatically sets expiration time for stored keys to
    save memory consumption.

SYNOPSYS
        # inside your app.psgi
        enable 'Throttle::Lite',
            backend => [
                'Redis' => {
                    instance => 'redis.example.com:6379',
                    database => 1,
                    password => 'VaspUtnuNeQuiHesGapbootsewWeonJadacVebEe'
                }
            ];

OPTIONS
    This storage backend must be configured in order to use. All options
    should be passed as a hash reference. The following options are
    available to tune it for your needs.

  instance
    A string consist of a hostname (or an IP address) and port number
    (delimited with a colon) or unix socket path of the redis-server
    instance to connect to. Not required. Default value is 127.0.0.1:6379.
    Some usage examples

        # tcp/ip redis-servers
        instance => '';                          # treats as '127.0.0.1:6379'
        instance => 'TCP:example.com:11230';     # ..as 'example.com:11230'
        instance => 'tcp:redis.example.org';     # ..as 'redis.example.org:6379'
        instance => 'redis-db.example.com';      # ..as 'redis-db.example.com:6379'
        instance => 'tcp:127.0.0.1';             # ..as '127.0.0.1:6379'
        instance => 'tcp:10.90.90.90:5000';      # ..as '10.90.90.90:5000'
        instance => '192.168.100.230';           # ..as '192.168.100.230:6379'
        instance => 'bogus:0'                    # ..as 'bogus:6379' (allowed > 0 and < 65536)
        instance => 'Inet:172.16.5.4:65000';     # ..as '172.16.5.4:65000'
        instance => 'bar:-100';                  # ..as 'bar:6379' (allowed > 0 and < 65536)
        instance => 'baz:70000';                 # ..as 'baz:6379' (allowed > 0 and < 65536) and so on..

        # unix sockets might be passed like this
        instance => 'Unix:/var/foo/Redis.sock';  # this socket path '/var/foo/Redis.sock'
        instance => '/bar/tmp/redis/sock';       # ..as '/bar/tmp/redis/sock',
        instance => 'unix:/var/foo/redis.sock';  # ..as '/var/foo/redis.sock',

  database
    A redis-server database number to store throttling data. Not obligatory
    option. If this one omitted then value 0 will be assigned.

  password
    Password string for redis-server's AUTH command to processing any other
    commands. Optional. Check the redis-server manual for directive
    *requirepass* if you would to use redis internal authentication.

  reconnect
    A time (in seconds) to re-establish connection to the redis-server
    before an exception will be raised. Not required. Default value is 10
    sec.

  every
    Interval (in milliseconds) after which will be an attempt to
    re-establish lost connection to the redis-server. Not required. Default
    value is 100 ms.

  debug
    Enables debug information to STDERR, including all interactions with the
    redis-server. Not required. Default value is 0 (disabled).

METHODS
  redis
    Returns a redis connection handle.

  rdb
    A redis database number to store data.
