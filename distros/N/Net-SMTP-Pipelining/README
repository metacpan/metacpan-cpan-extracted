TEST AGAINST A LIVE MAIL SERVER

You can test whether Net::SMTP::Pipelining works with your mail server by using
one of the test scripts in this distributions t/ directory (02.optional.t). To
enable this test, set the environment variable NSPipeliningInteractive to "yes"
before running "make test" (consult your system documentation on how to do this,
on *NIX with a bash shell you'd execute "export NSPipeliningInteractive=yes").
The test script will then prompt you for the information needed to run the test.

If you want to test this multiple times you can also create a file
t/optional.config containing the mail server name, the sender address and the
recipient address, each on a line. 02.optional.t will then no longer prompt you
for the information and instead read it from this file (you still need to have
the environment variable set for the test to run though).

Please note that testing against a live mail server will send actual email
through that server. Please make sure that you choose the settings so that
no-one will feel harassed or spammed by these messages. Also make sure that
your mail server will actually accept messages to/from the address you use,
otherwise the test will fail.
