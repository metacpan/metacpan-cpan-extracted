Revision history for the Persistent Base package.

Changes in Persistent 0.52	25 Feb 2000

  Thanks to Mike Blazer (blazer@mail.nevalink.ru), I was able to
  modify DBM.pm and File.pm to work under Windows95/98 and other ports
  of Perl that do not have a flock system call implemented.  The
  following changes were made to allow this:

  o Removed the use of POSIX.pm for the O_* constants and instead use
    Fcntl.pm for these constants now.
  o Put an eval block around all of the flock system calls to ignore
    any errors related to flock not being implemented on that platform.
    For example:

      eval { flock(LOCK_FH, $flock_type) or
        croak "Can't lock ($lock_type) $file.lock: $!";
      }; undef $@;

Changes in Persistent 0.51	22 Feb 2000

  Fixed a problem with file locking related to the following platforms:

    o hpux 10.20 PA-RISC1.1
    o sco 3.2v5.0.4 i386-sco
    o solaris 2.7 sun4-solaris

  Now a shared lock is obtained using a read-only file handle and an
  exclusive lock uses a write-only file handle.

Changes in Persistent 0.50	07 Feb 2000

  Alright, I'm lame.  I never got around to submitting Persistent to
  CPAN.  So here goes...

  This will be the first submission of Persistent to CPAN.  This release
  will contain the following modules:

      Persistent::Base
      Persistent::DBM
      Persistent::File
      Persistent::Memory
      Persistent::DataType::*

  We'll also in parallel submit these additional and separate modules:

      Persistent::LDAP
      Persistent::DBI (required by the following database modules)
      Persistent::MySQL
      Persistent::mSQL
      Persistent::Oracle
      Persistent::Sybase (if we can find a Sybase database!)

  Here are some actual changes in this release:

  Base
  ----
  o renamed the register_field method to add_attribute

  o merged methods: debug and ShowSQL attribute
      now you can pass a 'SQL' and 'LDAP' argument to print out
      their respective generated query statements

  DBM
  ---
  o fixed possible problem: changed order of args for DBM datastore method
      from: DBM->datastore($file, $type, $delimiter)
      to:   DBM->datastore($file, $delimiter, $type)

  o checked lock library that I was using
      Some people complained that it was slow.

  First release of the Persistent classes to CPAN.  This initial release
  of the base package consists of the Persistent::Base, Persistent::DBM,
  Persistent::File, Persistent::Memory, and Persistent::DataType::*
  classes.  All of the classes have been documented and there is also an
  overview document for the Persistent classes, Persistent.pod.
