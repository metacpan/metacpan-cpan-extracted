0.20 Wed Feb 13 00:00:22 UTC 2001

	- Made error messages more informative.  Thanks to Tim Ayers for the
	  suggestion.

	- Made set() method return the ISIN object, rather than the ISIN
	  as a string, to allow $isin->set("GB0004005475")->is_valid.  (Note
	  that stringification means that print $isin->set("GB0004005475")
	  still works).

0.11 Thu Oct  4 21:22:51 BST 2001

	- Fixed algorithm bug and checked against thousands of ISINs.
	  Thanks to Peter Dintelmann for providing useful feedback and test
	  data.
	
	- Added PS country code (Palestine).

0.10 Sat Sep 29 06:42:39 UTC 2001

	- Changed algorithm to cope with ISINs containing letters, such
	  as "US459056DG99".
	
	- Checked algorithm against draft copy of update of ISO 6166.

0.01 Sat Mar 10 15:17:41 UTC 2001
