        - Conversion to dzil packaging and public release of library to CPAN to
          assist with maintenance of applications with this legacy dependency.
        - Additions of tests using SQLite.
        - Changes to the library itself since 0.096 limited almost exclusively
          to packaging, testing, and documentation. Functionality is unaltered.

        - Ugly work-around to properly handle CTEs as read-oriented DML.

        - Finally added a new entry to the horribly decrepit and out of date
          Changes file.
        - Dropping the code on Github, without any further modifications.

        - Brand-new YAML config loader with support for multiple datastore
          configs in one location, auto-discovery of appropriate config based
          on top-level package namespace in stack, new syntax in constructor.
        - Various bug fixes from the last version of SQL::Wrapper.
        - Cleaner debugging support (code still needs a lot more DEBUG checks).
        - New methods: hashref(), next_hashref(), schemas().
        - Automatic rollbacks on connect in the event a cached connection is
          returned with a stale transaction still open.

0.080   2007-11-02
        - Branch from original in-house only SQL::Wrapper to the new
          name DBIx::DataStore.
