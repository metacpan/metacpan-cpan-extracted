NAME

    Tcl extension module for Perl5

DESCRIPTION

    The Tcl extension provides a small but complete interface into libtcl and
any other Tcl-based library. It lets you create Tcl interpreters as perl5
objects, execute Tcl code in those interpreters and so on. There is a Tcl::Tk
extension (not to be confused with "native" perl5 Perl/Tk extension)
distributed separately which provides a raw but complete interface to the
whole of libtk via this Tcl extension.

Using "tcl stubs", module could be built even without tcl-dev package
installed on system. Still, tcl (or tcl/tk) must be installed during module
build. --nousestubs also supported. Tcl versions 8.4, 8.5, 8.6 and above are
supported.

Build in the usual way for a perl extension:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

This will take reasonable defaults on your system and should be ok for most
uses. In some rare cases you need to specify parameters to Makefile.PL, such
as pointing non-standard locations of tcl/tk, etc. Use --help option to find
out supported parameters to Makefile.PL:

   perl Makefile.PL --help

See License, Authors sections in Tcl.pm, or with 'perldoc Tcl' - once it
is installed - to have acknowledged on this type of information.
