    Alien::Build::Plugin::Download::GitHub - Alien::Build plugin to
    download from GitHub

VERSION

    version 0.05

SYNOPSIS

     use alienfile;
    
     ...
    
     share {
     
       plugin 'Download::GitHub' => (
         github_user => 'Perl5-Alien',
         github_repo => 'dontpanic',
       );
     
     };

DESCRIPTION

    This plugin will download releases from GitHub. It is generally
    preferred over Alien::Build::Plugin::Download::Git for packages that
    are released on GitHub, as it has much fewer dependencies and is more
    reliable.

PROPERTIES

 github_user

    The GitHub user or org that owns the repository. This property is
    required.

 github_repo

    The GitHub repository name. This property is required.

 include_assets

    Defaulting to false, this option designates whether to include the
    assets of releases in the list of candidates for download. This should
    be one of three types of values:

    true value

      The full list of assets will be included in the list of candidates.

    false value

      No assets will be included in the list of candidates.

    regular expression

      If a regular expression is provided, this will include assets that
      match by name.

 version

    Regular expression that can be used to extract a version from a GitHub
    tag. The default ( qr/^v?(.*)$/ ) is reasonable for many GitHub
    repositories.

 prefer

    How to sort candidates for selection. This should be one of three types
    of values:

    code reference

      This will be used as the prefer hook.

    true value (not code reference)

      Use Alien::Build::Plugin::Prefer::SortVersions.

    false value

      Don't set any preference at all. The order returned from GitHub will
      be used if no other prefer plugins are specified. This may be
      reasonable for at least some GitHub repositories. This is the
      default.

CAVEATS

    The GitHub API is rate limited. The unauthenticated API is especially
    so. This may render this plugin inoperative for a short time after only
    a little testing. Please see
