HTTP/Server/Singlethreaded version 0.11
==================================
A single-threaded HTTP server suitable for building
stand-alone web applications around. On systems without
working non-blocking listening sockets, we can only
accept one new client per select interation, and the
module figures out what is available and uses does single
or multiple accept calls depending on the platform.

Tested under glibc linux and activestate on win2000.

This version is still very early, but the following command
line is able to produce a server on port 8000 that exports
the files in my /tmp directory and provides a clock service:

perl -we 'use HTTP::Server::Singlethreaded \
   static => {"/tmp/" => "/tmp"},\
   function => {"/d/" => sub { \
  "Content-type: text/plain\n\n$_{QUERY_STRING}\n".localtime \
  }};Serve while 1'


INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

Alternately, just create a HTTP/Server directory under
somwhere in your Perl installation's include path and
copy Singlethreaded.pm there.

You may want to edit the module some to make it a
little less chatty to STDOUT.

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires no modules or libraries not
distributed with core Perl.
