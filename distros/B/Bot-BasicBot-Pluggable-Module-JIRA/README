NAME
    Bot::BasicBot::Pluggable::Module::JIRA - Access JIRA via IRC!

VERSION
    This POD describes version 0.02

SYNOPSIS
    You will need to load the module into your instance:

        $bot->load('JIRA');

    Then feel free to interrogate the shit out of her:

        <diz> purl: what's going on with PRJ-284?
        <purl> diz: PRJ-284 (add jira support to bot) is unresolved - http://jira.domain.com/issue/284
        <diz> purl: who fixed PRJ-284?
        <purl> diz: gphat marked PRJ-284 as fixed in changeset bbb6a0f9

CONFIGURATION
  uri
    The location of the JIRA instance. (Ex, http://jira.domain.com)

  username
    User to authenticate against JIRA with. This is configured in JIRA. Note
    that the user will need permissions to view issues in order to send
    getIssue requests over the SOAP interface.

  password
    The password to use for the user during authentication. Also setup in
    JIRA (or LDAP if you're using the LDAP linkage).

  db_dsn (optional)
  db_user (optional)
  db_pass (optional)
    The SOAP API in JIRA is hit or miss. It exposes functionality that I'll
    never use while omitting other functionality that makes the API seem
    downright useless.

    One of the particular egregious omissions happens to be the lack of a
    remote interface for retrieving the ChangeHistory for an issue. If,
    however, you configure db_dsn, db_user, and db_pass, this module will
    attempt to extract that information directly from the database. This
    isn't recommended and has only been tested with 4.1.2.

  status_verbs
    The default inquiry format reports issue status by referring to the last
    status change in the past tense. By default, the reply uses "changed to"
    prepended to the status name. Instead of this, you may want the bot to
    respond using more colloquial language. You may do this by setting
    status_verbs to a hashref mapping status names to status verb phrases.
    (ie, { Open => 'opened' }) Any missing pairs default to "changed to".

  status_colors
    This one is fun. You may map issue status names to individual IRC colors
    by setting status_colors to a hashref containing the map. The following
    colors are understood:

    * bold

    * white

    * black

    * blue

    * green

    * red

    * brown

    * purple

    * orange

    * yellow

    * light_green

    * teal

    * cyan

    * light_blue

    * pink

    * gray

  formats
    Inquiry responses may be custom formatted. The formats configuration
    item is expected to be a hashref containing key/value pairs for each
    class of inquiry. The format is rendered using Text::Xslate. Several
    convienient xslate functions have also been provided. In addition to a
    function for each of the individual color names above, the following
    functions are available:

    * colorize

      colors the given text according to the configured status_colors

    The RemoteIssue object returned by JIRA::CLient is the root context of
    the template rendering, with the following keys added to the hashref:

    * issue (shortcut for key)

    * version (shortcut for the first fixVersion listed)

    * status_name (the issue's current status)

    * status_verb (the issue's current status in the past tense)

    If you've enabled the DBI options above, these are also available to
    you:

    * status_last_changed_user (user that most recently changed the issue
      status)

    * status_last_changed_datetime (DateTime object for the most recent
      status change)

    More details on the RemoteIssue object may be found in the JIRA docs:

    http://docs.atlassian.com/rpc-jira-plugin/4.1-1/com/atlassian/jira/rpc/s
    oap/beans/RemoteIssue.html

    Most all accessors methods on the RemoteIssue object are available in
    the stash as keys of the hashref. For example, getAssignee may be
    accessed in xslate like:

        <: $assignee :>

    The getComponents method, which returns a list of components, may be
    accessed using similar perl/xslate idioms:

        <: $components.0 :>

    The default inquiry format is:

        <: colorize($issue) :> [<: $version :>] <: bold($summary) :> for <: $assignee :>

    which produces replies such as:

        <purl> PRJ-284 [Unscheduled] add jira to bot for diz

    The default status format is:

        <: $issue :> [<: $version :>] was <: $status_verb :> by <: $status_last_changed_user :> on <: $status_last_changed_datetime.strftime("%Y %b %d (%a) at %l:%M %P") :>

    which produces replies such as:

        <purl> PRJ-284 [Unscheduled] was closed by diz on 2010 Sep 13 (Mon) at  1:26 pm

BUGS
    Probably a lot of them. The test suite does nothing beyond what
    Module::Starter already provides.
