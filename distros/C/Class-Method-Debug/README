NAME
    Class::Method::Debug - Trace who is calling accessors

VERSION
    version 1.101420

SYNOPSIS
        use Class::Method::Debug ':tracer';
        enable_scalar_tracer(name => 'foo');
        enable_hash_tracer('header', mykey => 'myvalue');

DESCRIPTION
    Provides method modifiers that trace who is setting scalar and hash
    attributes.

FUNCTIONS
  enable_scalar_tracer
    Takes as a mandatory argument an accessor name and enables a tracer on
    that accessor that prints a stack trace every time a value is set using
    the accessor. The accessor is expected to be for a scalar attribute. If
    you pass an optional second argument, the stack trace will only be
    printed if the value being set is (string) equal to that argument.

    This function is exported either by direct request or via the ":tracer"
    tag.

    Examples:

        use Class::Method::Debug ':tracer';
        enable_scalar_tracer('last_name');
        enable_scalar_tracer('first_name', 'Hikaru');

    The first tracer is run every time a new value is set using the
    "last_name()" accessor. The second tracer is run every time the
    "first_name()" accessor is used to set the attribute to "Hikaru". So:

        $obj->last_name('Shindou');    # triggers stack trace
        $obj->last_name;               # no stack trace

        $obj->first_name('Hikaru');    # triggers stack trace
        $obj->first_name('Akira');     # no stack trace
        $obj->first_name;              # no stack trace

  enable_hash_tracer
    Takes as a mandatory argument an accessor name and enables a tracer on
    that accessor that prints a stack trace every time a value is set using
    the accessor. The accessor is expected to be for a hash attribute. If
    you pass an optional second argument, the stack trace will only be
    printed if that hash key is being set. If you pass an optional third
    argument, the stack trace will only be printed if the value being set on
    that hash key is (string) equal to that argument.

    This function is exported either by direct request or via the ":tracer"
    tag.

    Examples:

        use Class::Method::Debug ':tracer';
        enable_hash_tracer('config');
        enable_hash_tracer('address', 'zip');
        enable_hash_tracer('header', 'to', 'foo@bar.com');

    The first tracer is run every time any hash value is set using the
    "config()" accessor. The second tracer is run every time the
    "aaddress()" accessor is used to set the "zip" key. The third tracer is
    run every time the "header()" accessor is used to set the "to" key to
    "foo@bar.com". So:

        $obj->config(foo => 'bar');    # triggers stack trace
        $obj->config;                  # no stack trace

        $obj->address(zip => 1080);      # triggers stack trace
        $obj->address(country => 'AT');  # no stack trace
        $obj->address;                   # no stack trace

        $obj->header(to   => 'foo@bar.com');      # triggers stack trace
        $obj->header(to   => 'baz@flurble.com');  # no stack trace
        $obj->header(from => 'foo@bar.com');      # no stack trace
        $obj->header;                             # no stack trace

  print_stacktrace
    Makes the stack trace, beautifies it, drops the frame from the tracer
    itself and warns it.
