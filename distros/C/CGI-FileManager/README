NAME
    CGI::FileManager - Managing a directory structure on an HTTP server

SYNOPSIS
    Enable authenticated users to do full file management on a subdirectory
    somewhere with a web server installed.

    After installing the module you have to create a file with usernames and
    passwords in it. For this we supply cfm-passwd.pl which should have been
    installed in your PATH. Type:

    > cfm-passwd.pl /home/user/mypwfile add someuser

    It will ask for password and the home directory that the use is supposed
    to be able to manage.

    Then in nearby CGI script:

     #!/usr/bin/perl -wT
     use strict;
 
     use CGI::FileManager;
     my $fm = CGI::FileManager->new(
                            PARAMS => {
                                    AUTH => {
                                            PASSWD_FILE => "/home/user/mypwfile",
                                    }
                            }
                    );
     $fm->run;

    Now point your browser to the newly created CGI file and start managing
    your files.

WARNING
     This is Software is in Alpha version. Its interface, both human and programatic
     *will* change. If you are using it, please make sure you always read the Changes
     section in the documentation.

VERSION
    Version 0.05

DESCRIPTION
    Enables one to do basic file management operations on a filesystem under
    an HTTP server. The actions on the file system provide hooks that let
    you implement custom behavior on each such event.

    It can be used as a base class for a simple web application that mainly
    manipulates files.

Methods
  cgiapp_init
    Initialize application (standard CGI::Application)

  setup
    Standart CGI::Appication method to setup the list of all run modes and
    the default run mode

  cgiapp_prerun
    Regular CGI::Application method

  redirect
    Just to easily redirect to the home page

  load_tmpl
    Change the default behaviour of CGI::Application by overriding this
    method. By default we'll load the template from within our module.

  message
    Print an arbitrary message to the next page

  login
    Show login form

  login_process
    Processing the login information, checking authentication, configuring
    the session object or giving error message.

  authenticate
    Called without parameter. Returns an objects that is capable to
    authenticate a user.

    By default it returns a CGI::FileManager::Auth object.

    It is planned that this method will be overriden by the user to be able
    to replace the authentication back-end. Currently the requirements from
    the returned object is to have these methods:

     $a->verify(username, password)   returns true/false
     $a->home(username)               return the full path to the home directory of the given user

    WARNING: this interface might change in the future, before we reach
    version 1.00 Check the Changes.

  logout
    logout and mark the session accordingly.

  change_dir
    Changes the current directory and then lists the new current directory

  list_dir
    Listing the content of a directory

  delete_file
    Delete a file from the server

  remove_directory
    Remove a directory

  unzip
    unzip

  rename_form
    Rename file form

  rename
    Rename file

  upload_file
    Upload a file

  create_directory
    Create a directory

  DEFAULT
    To get the default behavior you can write the following code. The module
    will use the built in templates to create the pages.

     #!/usr/bin/perl -wT
     use strict;
 
     use CGI::FileManager;
     my $fm = CGI::FileManager->new(
                            PARAMS => {
                                    AUTH => {
                                            PASSWD_FILE => "/home/user/mypwfile",
                                    }
                            }
                    );
     $fm->run;

    new(OPTIONS)

  META-DATA
    Theoretically we could manage some meta-data about each file in some
    database that can be either outside our virtual file system or can be a
    special file in each directory.

  Limitations
    The user running the web server has to have read/write access on the
    relevant part of the file system in order to carry out all the
    functions.

USE CASES
  Virtual web hosting with no ftp access for one user
    A single user needs authentication and full access to one directory
    tree. This does not work yet.

     #!/usr/bin/perl -T
 
     use CGI::FileManager;
     my $fm = CGI::FileManager->new({
                 ROOT => "/home/gabor/web/client1",
                 AUTH => ["george", "WE#$%^DFRE"],   # the latter is the crypt-ed password we expect
                 });
     $fm->run;

  Virtual web hosting with no ftp access for a number of users
    A number of users need authentication and full access to one directory
    tree per user.

     #!/usr/bin/perl -T
 
     use CGI::FileManager;
     my $fm = CGI::FileManager->new(
                            PARAMS => {
                                    AUTH => {
                                            PASSWD_FILE => "/home/user/mypwfile",
                                    }
                            }
                    );
     $fm->run;

     The mypwfile file looks similar to an /etc/passwd file:
     username:password:uid:gid:geco:homedir:shell

     gid and shell are currently not used
     homedir is the directory the user has rights for
     password is encrypted by crypt
     uid is just a unique number

Changes
  v0.01 2004 June 27
     Initial release

  v0.02_01
     Move file/directory
     Unzip file (.zip)

  v0.02_02
     Separate CGI::FileManager::Templates
     add cfm-install.pl install script

     Use CGI::Application::Plugin::Session
     remove catching the warning of CA and require higher version of CA
     add a test that test a particular warning
     some subs were called as functions, now they are called as methods allowing better subclassing

TODO
     - install the module as regular CPAN module and add a script that will generate the templates
       and hard-code their location in the script.
 
     - Replace the Unix::ConfigFile with my own implementation

     Test the module on Windows and find out what need to be done to pass the windows
     tests ? Especially look at Unix::ConfigFile

     Show most of the error messages on the directory listing page
 
     Support for filenames with funny characters (eg. space)

     Test all the functions, look for security issues !
     Show the current directory  (the virtual path)
     Separate footer/header
     Enable external templates

     Security issues: can I be sure that unzipping a file will open files only under the current directory ?
     What should I do in case a file that comes from an unzip operation already exists ?

     ZIP: currently the path to unzip is hard coded. It probably should be replaced by Archive::Zip

     More fancy things:
     Create file
     Copy file/directory
     Unzip file (tar/gz/zip)
     Edit file (simple editor)

     look at CGI::Explorer and check what is the relationsip to it ?
