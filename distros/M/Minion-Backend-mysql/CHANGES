Revision history for Perl extension Minion::Backend::mysql.

0.17      2019-08-27 16:11:57-05:00 America/Chicago

  [Fixed]

  - Fixed migrations not running when given an existing MySQL
    connection. Thanks @larryl and Grant Street Group!
  - Improved performance for locks and dequeueing. Thanks @larryl and
    Grant Street Group!
  - Fixed the statistics to work under MySQL strict mode. Thanks @larryl
    and Grant Street Group!

0.16      2019-08-10 21:27:33-05:00 America/Chicago

  [Added]

  - Added Travis tests for more MySQL and MariaDB versions. Thanks
    @paultcochrane for the initial work on this. (Github #1)
  - You can now pass in a connected Mojo::mysql instance to the backend
    to make it use that (instead of creating its own instance). This can
    help make sure that concurrent connections are limited and reused.
    Thanks @larryl & @GrantStreetGroup for contributing this!
    (Github #22)

  [Fixed]

  - Fixed SQL errors under MySQL strict mode (Specifically, the SQL
    GROUP BY columns need to be specified as SELECTed). Thanks @larryl
    & @GrantStreetGroup! (Github #22)
  - Fixed backend creating dozens of connections to MySQL. Now basic
    operations should be far more efficient. Thanks @larryl
    & @GrantStreetGroup! (Github #22)

0.15      2018-11-10 11:46:56-06:00 America/Chicago

  [Fixed]

  - Fixed warning when pulling history for the Minion admin console.
    Thanks @chromedome! [Github #20]
  - Fixed tests failing with "DBD::mysql::st execute failed: This
    function has none of DETERMINISTIC, NO SQL, or READS SQL DATA in its
    declaration and binary logging is enabled". MySQL 8 adds some sanity
    checks to functions and we need to override them. This might
    actually be a problem that we will have to fix later...

0.14      2018-04-30 20:41:08-04:00 America/New_York

  [Fixed]

  - Fixed backend to work with Minion v9.03. Thanks @pentabion! [Github
    #18]
  - Fixed an intermittently failing test. Thanks @pentabion! [Github
    #19]

  [Other]

  - Fixed Travis configuration to pass tests on 5.12/5.10 and improve
    performance

0.13      2018-02-03 11:28:16-06:00 America/Chicago

  [Added]

  - Added `list_locks` method so that the Minion admin UI works. Thanks
    @pentabion! [Github #17]

0.12      2018-01-14 01:22:07-06:00 America/Chicago

  [Fixed]

  - Fixed all the missing features from the backend to fully-support
    Minion 8.

0.11      2017-11-18 13:43:48-06:00 America/Chicago

  [Fixed]

  - Upgraded backend to work with Minion 8 and the Minion admin UI

  - Allow hashref of options to Mojo::mysql. This lets us pass in a full
    DBI connection string to use options not normally available via the
    `mysql://` URL string.

0.10      2017-11-05 19:12:38-06:00 America/Chicago

  [Fixed]

  - Fixed tests to only run on MySQL 5.6.5 or higher. Versions older
    than this do not support the `TIMESTAMP` column settings we are
    using. Thanks @paultcochrane!

  - Fixed tests to report which MySQL version is running so we can more
    easily detect why database queries are failing. Thanks
    @paultcochrane!

  - Fixed travis reporting coverage to coveralls. Thanks @paultcochrane!

  - Removed some whitespace-only POD lines which `podchecker` was
    complaining about. Thanks @paultcochrane!

0.09      2017-11-02 14:08:31-05:00 America/Chicago

  [Added]

  - Added initial Travis CI configuration. Thanks @paultcochrane!
    (Github #5)

  [Fixed]

  - Fixed missing test prereqs as requested by CPANTS. Thanks
    @paultcochrane! (Github #4)
  - Added an explicit Perl version declaration as requested by CPANTS.
    Thanks @paultcochrane! (Github #3)
  - Fixed links to Travis and Coveralls badges. Thanks @paultcochrane
    (Github #2)

0.08      2017-09-01 20:21:11-05:00 America/Chicago

  - Fixed contributors showing multiple times in the documentation

0.07      2017-09-01 20:02:45-05:00 America/Chicago

    - Increased size of args/result fields to support jobs with more
      information.

0.06  2017-09-01

    - Partial support for Minion 7.0
        - Automatic job retry
        - Worker commands
        - Missing features: job parents, locking, job notes
      This is enough to boot Minion and run basic jobs. Any jobs that
      depend on unimplemented features may not work correctly, and may
      cause errors.
