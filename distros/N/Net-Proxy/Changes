    [ENHANCEMENTS]
    - print a meaningful error message when the ssl connector can't listen

0.11 Mon Oct 15 03:44:30 CEST 2007
    [ENHANCEMENTS]

    - better support for the cases where accept() fails
    - better error message when accept() fails for a SSL socket
    [DOCUMENTATION]
    - added a tutorial about Net::Proxy, with code examples
    [TESTS]
    - prevent t/pod-coverage.t to fail on the upgrade_SSL method
      mixed in Net::Proxy::Connector::connect_ssl

0.10 Mon Oct  1 22:26:50 CEST 2007
    [DOCUMENTATION]
    - added information about the public SVN repository and the
      mailing-list
    [TESTS]
    - prevent t/21connect.t, t/32tcp_connect.t, t/90compile.t to fail
      when LWP::UserAgent is not installed

0.09 Thu Sep 13 11:01:21 CEST 2007
    [ENHANCEMENTS]
    - the notice(), info() and debug() methods now have a timestamp
    [TESTS]
    - prevent the t/37connectssl_tcp.t test script to die when one
      of the prerequisites is missing (thus removing many FAILs)

0.08 Mon Apr 23 19:08:30 CEST 2007
    [ENHANCEMENTS]
    - the hook callback now receives the socket on which the data
      was received, in addition to the connector
    [NEW CONNECTOR]
    - Net::Proxy::Connector::connect_ssl
      (combines Net::Proxy::Connector::connect and
      Net::Proxy::Connector::ssl in a single connector)
    [TESTS]
    - made tests more robust when connector prerequisites are missing
    - test Net::Proxy::Connector::ssl as an "in" connector
    - test the start_cleartext option of Net::Proxy::Connector::ssl

0.07 Sat Sep  2 19:47:24 CEST 2006
    [ENHANCEMENTS]
    - added support for SSL proxies (ssl connector)
    [NEW CONNECTOR]
    - Net::Proxy::Connector::ssl
    [TESTS]
    - add support for NET_PROXY_VERBOSITY environnement variable
      in the tests, to have more verbose tests if needed

0.06 Thu Apr 20 21:27:00 CEST 2006
    [ENHANCEMENTS]
    - add support for "hooks" on received data, as proposed by Martin
      Werthmöller (see http://www.cpanforum.com/threads/1991),
      but with a different implementation

0.05 Mon Apr 17 20:42:22 CEST 2006
    [ENHANCEMENTS]
    - added a debug() method (but all uses of it are commented out)
    - better socket management algorithm:
      + prevents deadlocks (as could occur when having a connection and
        a tunneled connection within it both going through Net::Proxy)
      + limits buffering (so as to avoid sucking a lot of memory
        when one socket sends data faster than its peer can accept it)
    [SCRIPTS]
    - patched sslh so that it can listen not only on localhost.
      (Thanks to Dieter Voegtli.)

0.04 Tue Jan 17 14:47:20 CET 2006
    [ENHANCEMENTS]
    - added some basic information logging
      (enable with Net::Proxy->set_verbosity( $level ))
    [TESTS]
    - test for several failure cases
    - the test suite now covers more than 95% of the code
    [SCRIPTS]
    - patched sslh so that it works correctly, now
