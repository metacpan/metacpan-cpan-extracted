=head1 NAME

Linux::Info::MemStats - Collect linux memory information.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Linux::Info::MemStats;

    my $lxs  = Linux::Info::MemStats->new;
    my $stat = $lxs->get;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Linux::Info::MemStats gathers memory statistics from the virtual F</proc> filesystem (procfs).

For more information read the documentation of the front-end module L<Linux::Info>.

=head1 MEMORY INFORMATIONS

Generated by F</proc/meminfo>.

    memused         -  Total size of used memory in kilobytes.
    memfree         -  Total size of free memory in kilobytes.
    memusedper      -  Total size of used memory in percent.
    memtotal        -  Total size of memory in kilobytes.
    buffers         -  Total size of buffers used from memory in kilobytes.
    cached          -  Total size of cached memory in kilobytes.
    realfree        -  Total size of memory is real free (memfree + buffers + cached).
    realfreeper     -  Total size of memory is real free in percent of total memory.
    swapused        -  Total size of swap space is used is kilobytes.
    swapfree        -  Total size of swap space is free in kilobytes.
    swapusedper     -  Total size of swap space is used in percent.
    swaptotal       -  Total size of swap space in kilobytes.
    swapcached      -  Memory that once was swapped out, is swapped back in but still also is in the swapfile.
    active          -  Memory that has been used more recently and usually not reclaimed unless absolutely necessary.
    inactive        -  Memory which has been less recently used and is more eligible to be reclaimed for other purposes.
                       On earlier kernels (2.4) Inact_dirty + Inact_laundry + Inact_clean.

    The following statistics are only available by kernels from 2.6.

    slab            -  Total size of memory in kilobytes that used by kernel for data structure allocations.
    dirty           -  Total size of memory pages in kilobytes that waits to be written back to disk.
    mapped          -  Total size of memory in kilbytes that is mapped by devices or libraries with mmap.
    writeback       -  Total size of memory that was written back to disk.
    committed_as    -  The amount of memory presently allocated on the system.

    The following statistic is only available by kernels from 2.6.9.

    commitlimit     -  Total amount of memory currently available to be allocated on the system.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new()

Call C<new()> to create a new object.

    my $lxs = Linux::Info::MemStats->new;

It's possible to set the path to the proc filesystem.

     Linux::Info::MemStats->new(
        files => {
            # This is the default
            path    => '/proc',
            meminfo => 'meminfo',
        }
    );

=head2 get()

Call C<get()> to get the statistics. C<get()> returns the statistics as a hash reference.

    my $stat = $lxs->get;

=head1 EXPORTS
