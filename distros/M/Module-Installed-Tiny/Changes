          information about the entry and nature of error. ("Can't locate
          Foo/Bar.pm (you may need to install the Foo::Bar module): EXTRA INFO
          (@INC contains ...)").

          entry index. The full return in list context is now: ($src, $path,
          $entry, $index).

        [Bug Fixes]

        - Consistently try not to die when passed die=>0 option, by enclosing
          calls to hook with eval { }.

        - In the error message, consistently show Foo::Bar as Foo/Bar.pm and do
          not use native path separator.
