NAME
    App::lcpan - Manage your local CPAN mirror

VERSION
    This document describes version 1.035 of App::lcpan (from Perl
    distribution App-lcpan), released on 2019-06-26.

SYNOPSIS
    See lcpan script.

FUNCTIONS
  authors
    Usage:

     authors(%args) -> [status, msg, payload, meta]

    List authors.

    Examples:

    *   List all authors:

         authors();

    *   Find CPAN IDs which start with something:

         authors( query => ["MICHAEL%"]); # -> undef

    This function is not exported by default, but exportable.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   cpan => *dirname*

        Location of your local CPAN mirror, e.g. /path/to/cpan.

        Defaults to "~/cpan".

    *   detail => *bool*

    *   index_name => *filename* (default: "index.db")

        Filename of index.

        If "index_name" is a filename without any path, e.g. "index.db" then
        index will be located in the top-level of "cpan". If "index_name"
        contains a path, e.g. "./index.db" or "/home/ujang/lcpan.db" then
        the index will be located solely using the "index_name".

    *   or => *bool*

        When there are more than one query, perform OR instead of AND logic.

    *   query => *array[str]*

        Search query.

    *   query_type => *str* (default: "any")

    *   use_bootstrap => *bool* (default: 1)

        Whether to use bootstrap database from App-lcpan-Bootstrap.

        If you are indexing your private CPAN-like repository, you want to
        turn this off.

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element (status) is an integer containing HTTP status code (200
    means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second element (msg) is
    a string containing error message, or 'OK' if status is 200. Third
    element (payload) is optional, the actual result. Fourth element (meta)
    is called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information.

    Return value: (any)

    By default will return an array of CPAN ID's. If you set "detail" to
    true, will return array of records.

  deps
    Usage:

     deps(%args) -> [status, msg, payload, meta]

    List dependencies.

    By default only runtime requires are displayed. To see prereqs for other
    phases (e.g. configure, or build, or ALL) or for other relationships
    (e.g. recommends, or ALL), use the "--phase" and "--rel" options.

    Note that dependencies information are taken from "META.json" or
    "META.yml" files. Not all releases (especially older ones) contain them.
    lcpan (like MetaCPAN) does not extract information from "Makefile.PL" or
    "Build.PL" because that requires running (untrusted) code.

    Also, some releases specify dynamic config, so there might actually be
    more dependencies.

    This function is not exported by default, but exportable.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   cpan => *dirname*

        Location of your local CPAN mirror, e.g. /path/to/cpan.

        Defaults to "~/cpan".

    *   flatten => *bool*

        Instead of showing tree-like information, flatten it.

        When recursing, the default is to show the final result in a
        tree-like table, i.e. indented according to levels, e.g.:

         % lcpan deps -R MyModule
         | module            | author  | version |
         |-------------------|---------|---------|
         | Foo               | AUTHOR1 | 0.01    |
         |   Bar             | AUTHOR2 | 0.23    |
         |   Baz             | AUTHOR3 | 1.15    |
         | Qux               | AUTHOR2 | 0       |

        To be brief, if "Qux" happens to also depends on "Bar", it will not
        be shown in the result. Thus we don't know the actual "Bar" version
        that is needed by the dependency tree of "MyModule". For example, if
        "Qux" happens to depends on "Bar" version 0.45 then "MyModule"
        indirectly requires "Bar" 0.45.

        To list all the direct and indirect dependencies on a single flat
        list, with versions already resolved to the largest version
        required, use the "flatten" option:

         % lcpan deps -R --flatten MyModule
         | module            | author  | version |
         |-------------------|---------|---------|
         | Foo               | AUTHOR1 | 0.01    |
         | Bar               | AUTHOR2 | 0.45    |
         | Baz               | AUTHOR3 | 1.15    |
         | Qux               | AUTHOR2 | 0       |

        Note that "Bar"'s required version is already 0.45 in the above
        example.

    *   include_core => *bool* (default: 1)

        Include core modules.

    *   include_noncore => *bool* (default: 1)

        Include non-core modules.

    *   index_name => *filename* (default: "index.db")

        Filename of index.

        If "index_name" is a filename without any path, e.g. "index.db" then
        index will be located in the top-level of "cpan". If "index_name"
        contains a path, e.g. "./index.db" or "/home/ujang/lcpan.db" then
        the index will be located solely using the "index_name".

    *   level => *int* (default: 1)

        Recurse for a number of levels (-1 means unlimited).

        index will be located in the top-level of "cpan". If "index_name"
        contains a path, e.g. "./index.db" or "/home/ujang/lcpan.db" then
        the index will be located solely using the "index_name".

    *   use_bootstrap => *bool* (default: 1)

        Whether to use bootstrap database from App-lcpan-Bootstrap.

        If you are indexing your private CPAN-like repository, you want to
        turn this off.

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element (status) is an integer containing HTTP status code (200
    means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second element (msg) is
    a string containing error message, or 'OK' if status is 200. Third
    element (payload) is optional, the actual result. Fourth element (meta)
    is called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information.

    Return value: (any)

  update
    Usage:

     update(%args) -> [status, msg, payload, meta]

    Create/update local CPAN mirror.

    This subcommand first create/update the mirror files by downloading from
    a remote CPAN mirror, then update the index.

    This function is not exported by default, but exportable.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   cpan => *dirname*

        Location of your local CPAN mirror, e.g. /path/to/cpan.

        Defaults to "~/cpan".

    *   exclude_author => *array[str]*

        Exclude files from certain author(s).

    *   force_update_index => *bool*

        Update the index even though there is no change in files.

    *   include_author => *array[str]*

        Only include files from certain author(s).

    *   index_name => *filename* (default: "index.db")

        Filename of index.

        If "index_name" is a filename without any path, e.g. "index.db" then
        index will be located in the top-level of "cpan". If "index_name"
        contains a path, e.g. "./index.db" or "/home/ujang/lcpan.db" then
        the index will be located solely using the "index_name".

    *   max_file_size => *int*

        If set, skip downloading files larger than this.

    *   remote_url => *str*

        Select CPAN mirror to download from.

    *   skip_file_indexing_pass_1 => *bool*

    *   skip_file_indexing_pass_2 => *bool*

    *   skip_file_indexing_pass_3 => *bool*

    *   skip_index_file_patterns => *array[re]*

        Skip one or more file patterns from being indexed.

    *   skip_index_files => *array[str]*

        Skip one or more files from being indexed.

    *   skip_sub_indexing => *bool* (default: 1)

        Since sub indexing is still experimental, it is not enabled by
        default. To enable it, pass the "--no-skip-sub-indexing" option.

    *   update_files => *bool* (default: 1)

        Update the files.

    *   update_index => *bool* (default: 1)

        Update the index.

    *   use_bootstrap => *bool* (default: 1)

        Whether to use bootstrap database from App-lcpan-Bootstrap.

        If you are indexing your private CPAN-like repository, you want to
        turn this off.

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element (status) is an integer containing HTTP status code (200
    means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second element (msg) is
    a string containing error message, or 'OK' if status is 200. Third
    element (payload) is optional, the actual result. Fourth element (meta)
    is called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra

    Return value: (any)

HISTORY
    This application began as CPAN::SQLite::CPANMeta, an extension of
    CPAN::SQLite. "CPAN::SQLite" parses "02packages.details.txt.gz" and
    "01mailrc.txt.gz" and puts the parse result into a SQLite database.
    "CPAN::SQLite::CPANMeta" parses the "META.json"/"META.yml" files in
    individual release files and adds it to the SQLite database.

    In order to simplify things for the users (one-step indexing) and get
    more freedom in database schema, "lcpan" skips using "CPAN::SQLite" and
    creates its own SQLite database. It also parses
    "02packages.details.txt.gz" but does not parse distribution names from
    it but instead uses "META.json" and "META.yml" files extracted from the
    release files. If no "META.*" files exist, then it will use the module
    name.
