NAME

    File::Edit::Portable - Read and write files while keeping the original
    line-endings intact, no matter the platform.

SYNOPSIS

        use File::Edit::Portable;
    
        my $rw = File::Edit::Portable->new;
    
        # read a file, replacing original file's line endings with
        # that of the local platform's default
    
        my $fh = $rw->read('file.txt');
    
        # edit file in a loop, and re-write it with its original line endings
    
        my $fh = $rw->read('file.txt');
        my $wfh = $rw->tempfile;
    
        while (<$fh>){
            ...
            print $wfh $_;
        }
    
        $rw->write(contents => $wfh);
    
        # get an array of the file's contents, with line endings stripped off
    
        my @contents = $rw->read('file.txt');
    
        # write out a file using original file's record separator, into a new file,
        # preserving the original
    
        $rw->write(contents => \@contents, copy => 'file2.txt');
    
        # replace original file's record separator with a new (custom) one
    
        $rw->write(recsep => "\r\n", contents => \@contents);
    
        # rewrite all files in a directory recursively with local
        # platform's default record separator
    
        $rw->dir(dir => '/path/to/files');
    
        # insert new data into a file after a specified line number
    
        $rw->splice(file => 'file.txt', line => $num, insert => \@contents);
    
        # insert new data into a file after a found search term
    
        $rw->splice(file => 'file.txt', find => 'term', insert => \@contents);
    
        # get a file's record separator
    
        $rw->recsep('file.txt'); # string form
        $rw->recsep('file.txt', 'hex'); # hex form
        $rw->recsep('file.txt', 'type');  # line ending type (nix, win, mac, etc)

DESCRIPTION

    The default behaviour of perl is to read and write files using the
    Operating System's (OS) default record separator (line ending). If you
    open a file on an OS where the record separators are that of another
    OS, things can and do break.

    This module will read in a file, keep track of the file's current
    record separators regardless of the OS, and save them for later
    writing. It can return either a file handle (in scalar context) that
    has had its line endings replaced with that of the local OS platform,
    or an array of the file's contents (in list context) with line endings
    stripped off. You can then modify this array and send it back in for
    writing to the same file or a new file, where the original file's line
    endings will be re-appended (or a custom ending if you so choose).

    Uses are for dynamically reading/writing files while on one Operating
    System, but you don't know whether the record separators are
    platform-standard. Shared storage between multpile platforms are a good
    use case. This module affords you the ability to not have to check each
    file, and is very useful in looping over a directory where various
    files may have been written by different platforms.

EXPORT

    None by default. See EXPORT_OK

EXPORT_OK

    recsep(), platform_recsep()

METHODS

 new

    Returns a new File::Edit::Portable object.

 read('file.txt')

    In scalar context, will return a read-only file handle to a copy of the
    file that has had its line endings replaced with those of the local OS
    platform's record separator.

    In list context, will return an array, where each element is a line
    from the file, with all line endings stripped off.

    In both cases, we save the line endings that were found in the original
    file (which is used when write() is called, by default).

 write

    Writes the data back to the original file, or alternately a new file.
    Returns 1 on success. If you inadvertantly append newlines to the new
    elements of the contents array, we'll strip them off before appending
    the real newlines.

    Parameters:

    file => 'file.txt'

    Not needed if you've used read() to open the file. However, if you have
    multiple read()s open, write() will die without the 'file' param, as it
    won't know which file you're wanting to write.

    copy => 'file2.txt'

    Set this if you want to write to an alternate (new) file, rather than
    the original.

    contents => $filehandle or contents => \@contents

    Mandatory - either an array with one line per element, or a file handle
    (file handle is far less memory-intensive).

    recsep => "\r\n"

    Optional - a double-quoted string of any characters you want to write
    as the line ending (record separator). This value will override what
    was found in the read() call. Common ones are "\r\n" for Windows, "\n"
    for Unix and "\r" for Mac. Use a call to platform_recsep() as the value
    to use the local platforms default separator.

 splice

    Inserts new data into a file after a specified line number or search
    term.

    Parameters:

    file => 'file.txt'

    Mandatory.

    insert => \@contents

    Mandatory - an array reference containing the contents to merge into
    the file.

    copy => 'file2.txt'

    Optional - we'll read from file, but we'll write to this new file.

    line => Integer

    Optional - Merge the contents on the line following the one specified
    here.

    find => 'search term'

    Optional - Merge the contents into the file on the line following the
    first find of the search term. The search term is put into qr, so
    single quotes are recommended, and all regex patterns are honoured.
    Note that we also accept a pre-created qr// Regexp object directly (as
    opposed to a string).

    limit => Integer

    Optional - When splicing with the 'find' param, set this to the number
    of finds to insert after. Default is stop after the first find. Set to
    0 will insert after all finds.

    NOTE: Although both are optional, at least one of line or find must be
    sent in. If both are sent in, we'll warn, and operate on the line
    number and skip the find parameter.

    Returns an array of the modified file contents.

 dir

    Rewrites the line endings in some or all files within a directory
    structure recursively. By default, rewrites all files with the current
    platform's default line ending. Returns an array of the names of the
    files found.

    Parameters:

    dir => '/path/to/files'

    Mandatory.

    types => ['*.txt', '*.dat']

    Optional - Specify wildcard combinations for files to work on. We'll
    accept anything that File::Find::Rule::name() method does. If not
    supplied, we work on all files.

    maxdepth => Integer

    Optional - Specify how many levels of recursion to do after entering
    the directory. We'll do a full recurse through all sub-directories if
    this parameter is not set.

    recsep => "\r\n"

    Optional - If this parameter is not sent in, we'll replace the line
    endings with that of the current platform we're operating on.
    Otherwise, we'll use the double-quoted value sent in.

    list => 1

    Optional - If set to any true value, we'll return an array of the names
    of the files found, but won't take any editing action on them.

    Default is disabled.

 recsep('file.txt', $want)

    Returns the record separator found within the file. If the file is
    empty, we'll return the local platform's default record separator.

    The optional $want parameter can contain either 'hex' or 'type'. If
    'hex' is sent in, the record separator will be returned in hex form
    (eg: "\0d\0a" for Windows). If 'type' is sent in, we'll return a
    short-form of the line-ending type (eg: win, nix, mac, etc).

    Note that this method can be imported into your namespace on demand if
    you don't need the object functionality of the module.

 platform_recsep($want)

    Returns the the current platform's (OS) record separator in string
    form.

    The optional $want parameter can contain either 'hex' or 'type'. If
    'hex' is sent in, the record separator will be returned in hex form
    (eg: "\0d\0a" for Windows). If 'type' is sent in, we'll return a
    short-from of the line-ending type (eg: win, nix, mac, etc).

    Note that this method can be imported into your namespace on demand if
    you don't need the object functionality of the module.

 tempfile

    Returns a file handle in write mode to an empty temp file.
