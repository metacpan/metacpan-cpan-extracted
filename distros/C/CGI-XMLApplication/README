CGI::XMLApplication

How To Install?

The installation should be perlish

perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install

CGI::XMLApplication requires the XML::LibXML and XML::LibXSLT module.
Both modules are available on CPAN.

What is CGI::XMLApplication?

Perl modules to implement OO CGI-Scripts with XML capabilities in
Perl similar to CGI::Application. It is not related to CGI::XML
(than it would be CGI::XML::Application) and does share its features.

CGI::XMLApplication is not a simple addon to CGI.pm! I think there
is no simple and fast way to convert existing CGI scripts. This is
basicly because of the gap of main concepts and paradigmata between
CGI.pm and CGI::XMLApplication, although CGI.pm is the SUPER class of
CGI::XMLApplication.

Why is there so much broken english?

The original code and documentation has been writtin in 2003/4 and
the documentation shows my poor English back then.
If you find the documentation offending to the English language, please
nudge me via RT.cpan.org and ask me to improve a particular section. I
will see to it that I will improve the documentation. An even
better approach is to create a pull-request on github that corrects the language.

Behind the scene.

While most CGI-Scripts are embedded into larger web based applications
the scripts themselves usually do not represent this fact. The
evolutionary grown mosaic of an traditional CGI-Script assembly style
application cannot easily be extended with certain features, relevant
to the application in general.

CGI::XMLApplication is an application framework to implement
CGI-Scripts in Perl without the overhead of a complete Perl
application. The framework should hide most of the important, but
redundant code of a Perl CGI-Application shared by several
scripts. Since CGI.pm is a very powerfull module to implement CGI
scripts it is used as a super class of CGI::XMLApplication. This
should make the implementation of new scripts usinge this class easy,
since the whole Interface of CGI.pm is still available. There are some
conceptual changes, basicly related to the response that reflect
concepts of XML/XSLT. This has the effect, that most output functions
of CGI.pm are not very usefull if used from this class ;)

The module have especially been written to enable Perl newbees to
write full featured CGI-Scripts and CGI applications. To make things
more easier readable for people, the CGI:OO module forces the
programmer to implement the application rather problem-orientated than
programm-code-orientated.

Using such concepts makes it much easier for people, who want to
understand the code -- and usually they are forced to --, to follow
the structure of the application.  In larger software projects this is
a very important aspect.

Using the object and problem orientated application programming
paradigma makes it possible to develop a certain (web based)
application aloing its structure, not along the restraints of its
primary programming language.  The CGI::XMLApplication concept opens the
possiblity to port the application to another programming language
(like C++ or Java) more easily. This aspect is quite important if a
port has to be done -- be it for performance or any other reasons.

Why should I use it?

If you are planning to implement a single script CGI application, that
should do a very simple job, CGI::XMLApplication is probably not what
you are looking for. More commonly Netslaves like us are forced to
implement fully grown web based applications consisting of a set of
more or less isolated CGI-Scripts. Each script having a default
behaviour, for example doing something after an event like a button
being pushed or a link beeing followed by the client.  If you know a
little about CGI-Scripts, you may already have recognized that scripts
look amazingly similar in their principal function-set. Most of the
scripts may have quite similar implementations of the same basic
requirements they should fulfill. That being a potential source for
redundancy and painful hours debugging.  This is there
CGI::XMLApplication comes in -- a problem oriented application
framework to avoid redundancies and to facilitate easier portabilty of
Perl based CGI applications.

Where is the difference to CGI::Application?

This question is quite important, since CGI::Application was discussed
on the Web a lot at the time I wrote this module. The main difference
I see, is that CGI::XMLApplication includes the XML paradigma of
dispairing data and datapresentation.

The second major difference is, that a perl programmer does not have
that much freedom on the programm structure. Yes, CGI::XMLApplication
is rather strict for perl standards. I realized in my daily work that
this freedom causes a lot of problems in midsize or large web-based
applications.

The less obvious difference is how the data presentation is
done. While CGI::Application uses the "propritary" perl format for
data presentation, CGI::XMLApplication uses by default XML and XSLT,
which are standardised. This leaves the oportunity to change the
programm code and even the programming language, but leaves the data
model untouched. New output formats can be added without changing
the entire code.

Old-school CGI scripts will have most allways quite a lot print calls
(or at least some thing similar). All these calls are related to the
field of data persentation, usually a job done by designers or HTML
programmers. Both modules CGI.pm and CGI::Application include such
formating functions. A perl coder using CGI::XMLApplication does not
need to bother about the data a client will finally see. Therefore,
formated output calls as they are used in CGI.pm and CGI::Application
doesn't make much sense with CGI::XMLApplication. Presenting data is
handled via XSLT Stylesheets. The script has to care only about the
data, which should be kept in a XML-DOM. So a script programmer
can pass data to a stylesheet and does not care about the output
anymore.

As well CGI::XMLApplication implements a stricter application
structure, than CGI::Application. CGI::XMLApplication handles script
initialization, functionality, cleanup and data output is strictly
separated parts of the script.
