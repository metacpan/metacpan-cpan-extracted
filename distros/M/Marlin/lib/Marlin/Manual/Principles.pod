Marlin::Manual::Principles - getting the most out of Marlin

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Following this advice will help you get the most out of Marlin:

=over

=item *

Aim for objects to be immutable. Mutable objects are a foot gun.
Marlin defaults to attributes being "ro" for a reason.

=item *

Type coercions are nice, but will slow down your constructor so
should be used sparingly.

=item *

Eager defaults/builders will slow down your constructors. If you want
fast constructors, use lazy defaults/builders.

=item *

Lazy defaults/builders will slow down your accessors. If you want
fast accessors, use eager defaults/builders.

Sorry you can't have it both ways. Though see:
L<https://github.com/tsee/Class-XSAccessor/pull/14>.
