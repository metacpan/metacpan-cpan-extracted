      This puts jQuery in the directory where the dist is currently being
      built, where it will be incorporated into the dist.

      This puts jQuery in the root directory (The same directory that
      contains dist.ini). It will also be included in the built
      distribution.

 cache

    Cache the results so that the Internet is required less frequently.
    Defaults to 0.

CAVEATS

    copyright section to include a notice that bundled copy of jQuery is
    copyright the jQuery Project and is licensed under either the MIT or
    GPLv2 license. This module does not bundle jQuery, but its dependency
    Resource::Pack::jQuery does.
