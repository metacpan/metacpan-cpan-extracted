	- Now does PAP and CHAP authentication, as well
	as the original ASCII. PAP and CHAP use TACACS+ version 1
	- Added flag to make_auth to specify the
	authentication type, plus string lengths (because
	in some auth types, the password string may contain NULs.
	- Added optional flag to ->authen() to specify the
	authentication type. Defaults to ASCII
	- Some reformatting to make it easier to read.
	- Cleaned up Makefiles so it builds cleaner

     - Mike McCauley (mikem@open.com.au) is now co-maintainer.
     - DISTNAME changed to Authen-TacacsPlus to be consistent with file
     naming of other Authen modules.
     - readme changed to README.
     - Added licensing statement to README, with the approval and consent of
     Mike Shoyher.
     - Fixed a typedef in md5.h that breaks md5 on 64 bit machines. Patch
     provided by Ernst Oudhof.
     - Removed bogus broken constant TACACS_CLIENT.
     - Fixed a number of compiler warnings, but still does not compile on
     Windows.

0.18 Sat Mar 15 2008, Mike McCauley
     - Disabled default setting of -symbolic in Makefile.PL
     on Solaris since it seems to be
     no longer required on most platforms.
     - Improved errmsg() so it works as advertised
     - test suite now uses Test.
     - test suite now skips if there is no Tacacs server to test against

0.19 Sun Mar 16 2008, Mike McCauley
     - Fixed 'make test' failure in taclibplus due to missing pure_all target

0.20 Fri July 10, 2009 Mike McCauley
     - Fixed incorect spelling of 'Authentication' in tac_client.c
     - implements a 
     timeout for the connect() operation. It uses the timeout value which is
     passed to the init_tac_session() function. Contributed by Robert Leibl

0.21 Sat Aug 13, 2011 Mike McCauley
     - Changes to TacacsPlus.pm to permit multiple servers to be specified in
     new(). Patches provided by Paulo A Ferreira.
     
0.22 Wed Jan 18, 2012 Mike McCauley
     - Fixed warning under perl 5.14g

0.23 Wed Aug 23, 2012 Mike McCauley
     - Fixed problems in low level read_data() function triggered when an
     incorrect key is used with some Tacacs+ servers, resulting in a 0-length
     read(), causing a seg
     fault on some platforms, and a very slow exit on others. This problem
     appears to have been in tac_client ever since I inherited this library.

0.24 Fri Mar 22, 2013 Mike McCauley
     - Updated author and distribution location details to airspayce.com

0.26 2015-12-08 Mike McCauley

     under Docker on armv7l, and possibly others
