	* [r1652] - As Red Hat 6.2 in chroot doesn't support setarch i386

	* [r1605] - Change urpmi.update call from /usr/bin (consolehelper)

	* [r1601] - pb correctly now differentiate PBDEP and BPBDEP (in
	  Env.pm for template generation
	  - pbtest uses now this feature
	  - Fix mageia 1 and 2 deps for VE
	  - remove a detail given in a generated pb_system as it creates
	  errors in the built script
	* [r1597] - Adds option pbshowsudo (false by default) to check
	  whether we display the detail of sudo commands (to match security
	  requiremetns) or not (to have a nicer output)
	  - Fix a template generation error in Env.pm for deb rules file
	  (line was split)
	  - In VE.pm fix modes of the chroot after the snapshot phase
	  detection to avoid error which make the code die
	  - In pb create the RPM build dirs before entering in the parallel
	  loop as sometimes 2 identical were created simultaneously,
	  leading to an error leading to a die
	  - In pb revert the code added by Eric to check deb content
	  creation as it was failing in my environement (naming issues).
	  Could be added after 0.12.1 is out as an additional check, but
	  anyway as the files are copied after, it's not that important.
	  - Use full path of chown in sudo for pb
	  - Make the test account a variable in pbtest
	  - Start to add test case for a VM in pbtest
	  - This patch makes pb build back in a debian 6 VE.

2012-05-24  Bruno Cornec <bruno@project-builder.org>

	* [r1596] - Improve system cmd display in Distribution.pm for deps
	  analysis
	  - umount /proc in the VE when using rpmbootstrap, if it wasn't
	  unmounted due to error, to allow snapshots to work correctly
	  - pbtest should now be able to build afio in an rpm VE (The VE is
	  setup correctly again, including fedora 16 having the requiretty
	  constraint))
	* [r1595] - pb_system is back to 3 params, as the previously
	  undocumented "mayfail" 3rd parameter povides what the 4th was
	  dded for. callers adapted in relationship
	* [r1594] - Fix a bug in VE context around the chown part (no
	  quotes without the sudo)
	  - Improve mageia 2 deps
	  - pbtest is nearly at the end

2012-05-23  Bruno Cornec <bruno@project-builder.org>

	* [r1593] - Fix mageia 1 VE creation support
	* [r1592] - Fix another bug in pb_check_req on the default value
	  used with a || where an undef wasn't different from a bad
	  integer.
	* [r1591] - Adds entry for mageia 2
	* [r1588] - Use pb_cjeck_req for all commands called in the VE for
	  its setup, so it can be used correctly in a secured environement
	  with a sudoers conf file (Cf pbtest)
	* [r1586] - Adds support for the PBVCSOPT env var to pass cli
	  options to the VCS command. Example is authentication method for
	  SVN as in pbtest.
	* [r1585] - Fix pb_syntax, where a call with an exit of 0 was seen
	  as false and thus lead to a value of -1. Now pb -h returns true
	* [r1584] - Move PBPROJ env var setuo from Env.pm to Conf.pm to
	  have it earlier available for some calls with less context.
	  - Fix a bug when (ve|vm|rm)path->ENV(PBPROJ) was undefined, and
	  expand its path when defined to support that type of definition
	  in conf files (pbtest does it)
	  - getconf now loads more conf files, and calls cms_compliant
	* [r1576] Add support of the PBVCSOPT environment variable to pass
	  options to the VCS command such as a login/passwd authentication
	  (useful for pbtest)

2012-05-22  Bruno Cornec <bruno@project-builder.org>

	* [r1564] - Fix typo n rpmbootstrap preventing it to run
	  - Fix the detection of setarch call with a more correct regexp
	  - New mageia mirror used (similar as mandriva)
	  - Add a test script to have a full regression suite before
	  publishing a new version

2012-05-21  Bruno Cornec <bruno@project-builder.org>

	* [r1560] -pb project: Add Copyrights specified by HP Open Source
	  Review Board (Eric Anderson)
	* [r1558] - pb: [BUGFIX] added code assumed it had
	  Parallel::ForkManager package. (Eric Anderson)
	  - Fix more typos on comma (Bruno Cornec)
	* [r1556] pb: Use new pbgpgcheck option to control whether we
	  enable gpgcheck in the repo script. Problem is that signing
	  failure is tolerated, so the rpms can be unsigned, but gpgcheck
	  is on by default. Preserve those semantics by default, but allow
	  for control. (Eric Anderson)
	  - pbgpgcheck is optional and default to 1 (Bruno Cornec)
	* [r1555] - pb: improve documentation on the project.pb entries.
	  Use new projcomponent value to specify which component we are
	  building for -- most things probably aren't contrib (for deb
	  based distros) (Eric Anderson)
	* [r1554] - pb: Update documentation, the newproj docs were missing
	  an important argument. Expanded out the newproj documentation.
	  Fixed the cms2build documentation to match the same style as the
	  other documentation. (Eric Anderson)
	  - CMS.pm/VCS.pm: Tolerate the file: scheme -- it was tolerated in
	  some places but not others. (Eric Anderson)
	* [r1553] - pb: log when we start and finish the build, that's an
	  important state. Add missing setting of all_ok to false that kept
	  us from properly stopping on errors. Fix typos in comments (coma
	  => comma). Greatly simplify pb_get_distros function by using
	  split and join. Also remove whitespace since multi-line conf file
	  support will cause that to be added. (Eric Anderson)
	  - Filter.pm: use new pb_pbos_to_keylist function to generate the
	  list of basenames we want, and use a loop rather than lots of
	  separate statements. Simplifies and makes more powerful this
	  function. Also now guaranteed to maintain consistency with key
	  lookups in the hash maps. (Eric Anderson)
	  - rename pb_pbos_to_keylist to pb_distro_to_keylist and make it
	  public (Bruno Cornec)
	* [r1551] - pbdistrocheck: remove hack to have common library path
	  and static ref to /usr/share/perl5. That should really be done in
	  the build process if needed not in code (Bruno Cornec)
	  - pb: Just create the /etc/sysconfig/network file on rpm based
	  distro not being opensuse (where it is a directory) (Eric
	  Andersson/Bruno Cornec)
	  - CMS.pm: drop log level down to 2 this is a pretty irrelevant
	  log message. (Eric Andersson)

2012-05-14  Bruno Cornec <bruno@project-builder.org>

	* [r1545] - pb: Add in better documentation for setupve, and add
	  documentation for build2ve. Make sure that if we are doing a
	  parallel build we will stop on errors if that option is set. Fix
	  the code for determining which output files were made. The .dsc,
	  .tar.gz, and .changes files are named based on the Source: option
	  in the debian control file. The .deb files can be extracted from
	  there or (as implemented) from the output of dpkg-deb. Verify
	  that all expected files are present. Refactor code to avoid
	  duplicating long filename construction. Fix bug in running in
	  32bit VE with 64bit host; the setarch command needs to be used to
	  make the child think it is running in a 32 bit environment. Make
	  the use of a key option to ssh optional so that if ssh-agent is
	  in use no key-file is generated. Do *not* set the time in a
	  virtual environment. It is getting it's time from the parent OS
	  and I believe this piece of code was mis-setting the time since
	  the VE thought it was in UTC rather than PST for the parent and
	  so was shifting the clock by many hours. In the script generated
	  in the sub-child, enable set -e if pb_stop_on_error is set so
	  that if the package build fails we don't try to keep going.
	  Having done that, /proc can remain around on failure, so tolerate
	  that state. Fix the documentation on how the date is being set.
	  Invert the loop that makes the bootstrapping project-builder so
	  that we only include each of the .pm files once; if you have
	  installed the pb-modules and have a locally built copy in @INC
	  you could get both copies in the bootstrap version which lead to
	  updating the source not changing the behavior. When getting the
	  ssh-keyfile, if ssh-agent is running, and asked to use it then
	  use it. Tolerate failures on the debsign step -- the key-file can
	  validly not exist. (Eric Anderson)
	  - Add a new option pbusesshagent in pb.conf to allow the user to
	  specify whether he wants to use his existing SSH environement and
	  agent, or if he prefers to create a new key pair for building.
	  (Bruno Cornec)
	* [r1544] Document ossueminorrel
	* [r1543] - setupve|m does not require a cms2 command earlier now.

2012-05-13  Bruno Cornec <bruno@project-builder.org>

	* [r1540] - vmmonport is now optional
	  - vmmem is also now really optional (wasn't working before as
	  wasn't correctly tested)
	  - We are allowed to kill the sleep during VMs wait without it
	  aborting the process
	  - newv(e|m) doesn't require execution of cms2build before being
	  available
	  - Fix another git support error introduced earlier
	* [r1539] - checking packages is allowed to fail
	  - Fix syntax error introduced by a previous patch
	  - When using git and pb_vcs_up, for git we need to loop on all
	  the dirs passed (change of interface after Eric's patch)
	* [r1538] - Use more confess instead of die in Conf.pm to debug a
	  calling issue
	* [r1536] - Improve git support for pb_vcs_get_uri (Eric Anderson)
	  as for the previous patches
	* [r1535] - Add git support in pb_vcs_up, pb_vcs_checkin and
	  pb_vcs_add

2012-05-12  Bruno Cornec <bruno@project-builder.org>

	* [r1530] - ossueminorrel option now initialized first, and
	  correectly. Removes warnings.
	  - other smaller fixes for CMD usage
	* [r1529] - Fix a typo introduced when adding the pbuseminorrel
	  option
	* [r1528] - Add Copyrights specified by HP Open Source Review Board
	  (Eric Anderson)
	  - Clarification of copyrights, dates and licences (Bruno Cornec)
	* [r1527] - VE.pm: Verify that the proxy variables are passed
	  through if we are using sudo. (Eric Anderson)
	* [r1526] - Document pbgpgcheck option. (Eric Anderson)
	  - Generate example of the 2 last new project options in th .pb
	  template (Bruno Cornec)
	* [r1525] - pb.conf: ospkgdep has changed for debian, er-sort
	  general to specific. (Eric Anderson)
	  - pb.conf.pod: document new projcomponent entry. (Eric
	  Anderson/Bruno Cornec)
	* [r1524] - Distribution.pm: check that package was installed
	  failed because package name could be truncated if COLUMNS env var
	  is set. Also log out missing dependencies at log level 1. Add
	  missing newlines on some log messages. (Eric Anderson)
	* [r1523] - pb.conf: Add scilinux to list of OS's. Add case where
	  centos versioning include minor since centos makes major changes
	  in minor releases. Fix typo in oracle linux regex. Proposes min
	  dependencies separately for centos-5.2, 5.6 others just match
	  that set. Add next ubuntu codename. (Eric Anderson)
	  - Distribution.pm: Add new pb_pbos_to_keylist function that
	  generates the keys that should be used for looking up filter
	  filenames or keys into the hash-maps. New function will generate
	  5.m, for all m in [0,n] for version 5.n of some OS. Useful
	  because minor versions are usually similar. Use it in
	  distro_get_param, simplifying the function and making it more
	  powerful. Fix comment to be correct, you can check for
	  scalar/list context if you want, but that's not what this code
	  does.

2012-05-11  Bruno Cornec <bruno@project-builder.org>

	* [r1522] pb.conf: dependency on perl-Date-Manip in project-builder
	  means that the mirror must come from the Everything repo rather
	  than the Fedora one. (Eric Anderson)
	* [r1521] - pb.conf: add auto-agree-with-licenses for opensuse,
	  other failures on install can occur. partially fix dependencies
	  for opensuse-11.2, stopped because the version isn't supported.
	  remove cracklib-dict-small, not actually a dependency. (Eric
	  Anderson)
	  - Distribution.pm: Fix bug, if we install with yum, put the repo
	  in the yum location. If we install with zypper, put it in the
	  zypper location. Otherwise complain that we don't know what to do
	  with the file. (Eric Anderson/Bruno Cornec)
	* [r1520] - Fix an error introduced when isolating the new
	  pb_distro_compare_repo function (Bruno Cornec)
	  - pbdistrocheck: hack so that we can have one pb package that
	  just works everywhere (Need a special use lib for opensuse) (Eric
	  Anderson)
	* [r1519] - pb.conf: Add support for centos-6: new osrelfile, add
	  initial dependencies, add perl and package dependencies (Eric
	  Anderson)
	  - Distribution.pm: Require that we have a functional install
	  command. The old protection code was wrong since without a valid
	  value it defaults to '', and if it had been correct would cause
	  installs to silently fail. (Eric Anderson)
	  - VE.pm: Run bootstrapping under linux32 (Bruno changed that to
	  setarch) if arch is i386 and host is x86_64/amd64 so that it gets
	  the architecture right. (Eric Anderson)
	* [r1518] - Base.pm: Don't display the error message if failure is
	  ok. Simplify cluck + exit to confess. (Eric Anderson)
	  - Env.pm: We are in a "", so escape the \'s. (Eric Anderson)

2012-05-10  Bruno Cornec <bruno@project-builder.org>

	* [r1517] r4765@localhost: bruno | 2012-05-10 17:08:00 +0200
	  - pb.conf: centos-5.6 moved python-libs into a separate package.
	  List it or otherwise we can't run yum. Fix the mirror servers for
	  centos-4,5 to just get the latest, and add mirror servers for 6.
	  - pb.conf.pod: document addrepo, looked here and didn't find it,
	  accidentally found it in code before adding it myself. Fix pod
	  glitch at the end (missing =over/=back)
	  - Distribution.pm: move the code to apply ftp_proxy/http_proxy
	  from the conf files to a sub function since it's now needed in
	  two places. Log the proxy and verify that everything we tried to
	  install succeeded since yum will silently tolerate failing to
	  install things, but rpmbuild will complain about missing
	  dependencies. Tolerate an error from testing install of an rpm in
	  pb_distro_setuprepo_gen.
	  - Env.pm: Give an example of multi-line filters and an example of
	  a transform.
	  - VE.pm: If the verpmtype isn't defined, error out cleanly.
	  Otherwise we're just going to fail later with lots of noisy
	  output.
	* [r1516] r4764@localhost: bruno | 2012-05-10 15:13:10 +0200
	  - Distribution.pm: Fix the code to check to see if a package is
	  installed. dpkg -L <package> can succeed on an installed but not
	  configured package, however, dpkg-buildpackage will later fail.
	  Fix is to check that the package is in the ii state. (Eric
	  Anderson)
	* [r1515] r4760@localhost: bruno | 2012-05-10 11:48:21 +0200
	  - pb.conf: sudo does not pass through the DEBIAN_FRONTEND
	  variable; use env to make sure it is set. Also change from
	  --force-yes to --allow-unauthenticated (Eric Anderson)
	  - Base.pm: Provide a better error message for failures of
	  pb_mkdir_p (Eric Anderson)
	  - Distribution.pm: Make sure to apply the ftp/http proxy when
	  installing dependencies. Also add hack to try the install twice
	  if it fails the first time. That may be unnecessary with the
	  DEBIAN_FRONTEND fix, but doesn't hurt. (Eric Anderson)
	* [r1514] r4759@localhost: bruno | 2012-05-10 11:12:46 +0200
	  Distribution.pm: Handle multi-line entries in debian control
	  files. Tolerate errors from listing dependencies since we handle
	  them in pb_distro_only_deps_needed. If the two files differ,
	  generate more error output. (Eric Anderson as the previous patch)
	* [r1513] r4758@localhost: bruno | 2012-05-10 10:49:36 +0200
	  Base.pm: Add a parameter to pb_system that allows commands to
	  fail even if pb_stop_on_error is set. Some callers handle the
	  error code. Add in pid to the error output from pb_system for
	  help in tracking down which parent ran the command.

2012-05-09  Bruno Cornec <bruno@project-builder.org>

	* [r1509] - Fix a build bug with the new prefix variable in
	  pb-module. Only use if it exists !
	  - pb_conf_init is called at low level on the default project to
	  avoid PBPROJ to be undefined and creatin lots of error msgs.
	  pbdistrocheck works again with it
	  - Fix sbx2setupvm in order to call pb_conf_init correctly at
	  start of the pbinit script.
	* [r1508] - pb.conf.pod: expand documentation a bit more. (Eric
	  Anderson from 73ca8f77a96586841affff0e41c8e29d4dbcecad)
	* [r1507] - pb.conf: installing project-builder requires
	  --force-yes since the keys don't get installed into the virtual
	  environment. (Eric Anderson from
	  d3145b5c2c63cf9cf00ffa818fa03a432a2e6e45)
	  - pb.conf.pod: Fix lots of typos (coma -> comma) Document new
	  ftp_proxy and http_proxy options. Document the rbsmirrorsrv
	  option (already supported, not documented) Document that sshlogin
	  and sshport are now optional parameters; both have reasonable
	  defaults (not in that patch, will come later) (Eric Anderson from
	  d3145b5c2c63cf9cf00ffa818fa03a432a2e6e45)
	  - Conf.pm: Use confess so when failing to get a parameter we get
	  a stack trace. (Eric Anderson from
	  d3145b5c2c63cf9cf00ffa818fa03a432a2e6e45)
	  - Distribution.pm: Fix typo (Donwloading -> Downloading); Fix
	  code so that you can try to setup a VE multiple times. Existing
	  debian code would fail the second time since pb.conf would
	  already exist. Unclear on correct semantics here; the rpm code
	  just force overwrites the file, but the old debian code was
	  trying not to. (Eric Anderson from
	  d3145b5c2c63cf9cf00ffa818fa03a432a2e6e45)
	  - Distribution.pm: Adding the internal function
	  pb_distro_compare_repo to avoid code duplication between apt and
	  yum repos treatment (Bruno Cornec)
	* [r1506] - Base.pm: add pb_path_expand to do the path expansion
	  for config values. Print out all sudo'd commands if we haven't
	  already so people know what they're typing their passwords in
	  for. (Eric Anderson from
	  aaf4d2337ab1554ba0c1f894108b3edc90996f69)
	  - Env.pm: use pb_path_expand instead of inline expansion. (Eric
	  Anderson from aaf4d2337ab1554ba0c1f894108b3edc90996f69)
	  - VE.pm: Error out if vetype isn't defined; improve variable
	  name, and verify that we don't try to launch a mips ve on x86_64
	  (previous check only prevented x86_64 on ix86). Use
	  pb_path_expand to expand out the vepath also. Make sure to create
	  the path to the VE before we try to bootstrap it. (Eric Anderson
	  from aaf4d2337ab1554ba0c1f894108b3edc90996f69)
	* [r1505] - Base.pm: use Carp and Cwd so we can give better error
	  messages. Use new Global::pb_stop_on_error variable to decide
	  whether we should abort on an error. (Eric Anderson from
	  9c3c696597c49b385df409311b1385d7a394db5a)
	  - Distribution.pm: Remove useless redundant check of deps not
	  maching whitespace, improve message since it is likely to call
	  sudo. Skip dependencies that are all whitespace since that leads
	  to errors when running dpkg -L <whitespace> (Eric Anderson from
	  9c3c696597c49b385df409311b1385d7a394db5a)

2012-05-08  Bruno Cornec <bruno@project-builder.org>

	* [r1504] - Avoid error msg in log when uri is undef in pb_get_uri
	  (Eric Anderson from 2f76f20dc7337edcc323b4efb45ba7831029dbc7)
	* [r1503] - Add possibility to use a PREFIX variable for Makefie.PL
	  for pb-module (Eric Anderson) from
	  b97fdb1f441101ad30da0f0d9ca399c57d08ffa8

2012-05-07  Bruno Cornec <bruno@project-builder.org>

	* [r1495] r4735@localhost: bruno | 2012-05-07 03:46:39 +0200
	  - Conf.pm largely rewritten to cache all conf files into a local
	  $h hash in which conf files are added in reverse order.
	  The new pb_conf_hash stores a configuration file into a hash
	  structure passed in parameter.
	  pb_conf_add now triggers the computation of the hash structure
	  with pb_conf_cache and adds it to the main $h hash.
	  pb_conf_read_if now just uses the content in the $h hash to
	  return its table.
	  pb_conf_get_in_hash_if function added to do the same as
	  pb_conf_read_if on the cached $h hash instead of a configuration
	  file.
	  pb_conf_get_if now uses pb_conf_get_in_hash_if and the $h hash
	  without re-reading conf files
	  pb_conf_add_last_in_hash adds the content of a hash behind the
	  content of the $h main hash (was done in pb_conf_get before)
	  pb_env_init now calls pb_conf_init to have PBPROJ defined when
	  needed.
	  pb seems to work with this new version (builds itself)
	  - Add a new getconf option to pb in order to see the state of the
	  current configuration parameters (now in memory)

2012-04-30  Bruno Cornec <bruno@project-builder.org>

	* [r1493] - Fix the previous improvement by using really a list as
	  second parameter
	* [r1492] - pb_vcs_add and pb_vcs_up now support a list of
	  dirs/files as second parameter

2012-04-24  Bruno Cornec <bruno@project-builder.org>

	* [r1486] - pb_mkdir_p now returns the return value of mkpath
	  - Do not point onto Cauldron anymore for Mageia chroots

2012-04-16  Bruno Cornec <bruno@project-builder.org>

	* [r1469] - Split CMS functions in 2 parts, one lowlevel reusable
	  outside of pb in VCS.pm, the remaining stay in CMS.pm, part of
	  pb.

2012-04-15  Bruno Cornec <bruno@project-builder.org>

	* [r1465] - Fix a minor POD error
	* [r1464] - Fix a remaining issue with extdir in newproj, which
	  wasn't using it

2012-04-07  Bruno Cornec <bruno@project-builder.org>

	* [r1460] - Prepare support for os-release coming from systemd

2012-04-06  Bruno Cornec <bruno@project-builder.org>

	* [r1452] - Fedora 4 and 5 also use sha1 as checksum mecaniss (some
	  people seems to still use it !)

2012-03-27  Bruno Cornec <bruno@project-builder.org>

	* [r1443] - Env.pm now generates also template files with extdir

2012-03-17  Bruno Cornec <bruno@project-builder.org>

	* [r1433] r4570@cabanilles: bruno | 2012-03-15 14:21:23 +0100
	  - Improve return value documentation of pb_check_req

2012-02-26  Bruno Cornec <bruno@project-builder.org>

	* [r1429] - Fix rpmbootstrap to support sites with multiple href in
	  their page (opensuse main site e.g)
	  - Fix conf to support VE for opensuse 12.1
	* [r1428] - update opensuse mirror as kernel.org is not up to date
	* [r1427] - Add more VM to build
	  - Rename suse-11 in opensuse as well as 10.3

2012-02-25  Bruno Cornec <bruno@project-builder.org>

	* [r1425] - Adds a new -k option to kep some temporary files for
	  debug purposes
	  - Fix newvm as the awk call was broken
