NAME
    Parse::CPAN::Cached - Parse CPAN meta files & cache the results

VERSION
    Version 0.02

SYNOPSIS
    Ensure you already have a CPAN::Mini mirror setup, then:

        use Parse::CPAN::Cached;
        my $parsers       = Parse::CPAN::Cached->new();

        # $authors is a Parse::CPAN::Authors (or Parse::CPAN::Whois) object
        my $authors       = $parsers->parse_cpan('authors');

        # $distributions is a Parse::CPAN::Packages object
        my $distributions = $parsers->parse_cpan('packages');

DESCRIPTION
    Parsing the CPAN meta data files can take a few seconds if you do it
    normally:

      my $p = Parse::CPAN::Packages->new($filename);

    this wraps the parsing/loading with App::Cache which in turn stores the
    initial parse in a storable file.

    Provided the cache hasn't expired, subsequent calls are loaded from this
    storable file rather than being re-parsed from the original cpan
    metadata file. If the cache has expired, we re-parse the source.

    This is probably redundant unless you are repeatadly opening these files
    (in different processes perhaps).

    Note: 02packages.details.txt.gz (circa 2009-03) is ~730KB on disk but
    13MB as a (App::Cached generated) Storable file. We're trading disk &
    memory for speed.

CONSTRUCTOR METHODS
    All are optional.

  cpan_mini_config
    Defaults to the result of calling CPAN::Mini->read_config. We only use
    the 'local' value returned, so you could say:

        my $parsers = Parse::CPAN::Cached->new(
            cpan_mini_config => { local => '/path/to/mini_cpan/' }
        );

  cache
    Defaults to App::Cache->new(). If you want to change any of the defaults
    in App::Cache, construct your own App::Cache first and pass it in.

  info
    A coderef that is called to emit some information about what is going
    on. By default, we're silent under normal operation but if you want a
    little more detail about what is happening pass in a coderef that
    accepts a single string parameter.

        my $parsers = Parse::CPAN::Cached->new(
            info => sub { warn @_, "\n" }
        );

    Currently the only time this is used is when we're about to parse one of
    the cpan meta data files form scratch, rather than loading in the data
    via the cache.

METHODS
    There is only one.

  parse_cpan
    Give it the key, get back the appropriate Parse::CPAN::Foo object.

        my $parsers = Parse::CPAN::Cached->new();
        my $result  = $parsers->parse_cpan($key);

    Where $key is one of:

   packages
    Returns a Parse::CPAN::Packages object.

   authors
    Returns either a Parse::CPAN::Authors object or a (api compatible)
    Parse::CPAN::Whois object if the 00whois.xml file exists.

   whois
    Returns a Parse::CPAN::Whois object.
