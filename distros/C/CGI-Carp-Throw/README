CGI-Carp-Throw version 0.02
===========================

CGI::Carp::Throw provides the ability to represent thrown
exceptions as user oriented messages rather than obvious
error messages with technical tracing information.  It adds
the new functionality without losing any of the capabilities for
providing error tracing from CGI::Carp.

By default it imports the function throw_browser as well as
some default functions such as croak and carp from CGI::Carp.
You can also request the import of throw_browser_cloaked and
throw_format_sub as well as the importable methods of CGI::Carp.
Detailed documentation of all methods are available in the POD
of CGI::Carp::Throw and CGI::Carp.
