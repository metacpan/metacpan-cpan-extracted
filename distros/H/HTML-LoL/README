NAME
    HTML::LoL - construct HTML from pleasing Perl data structures

SYNOPSIS
      use HTML::LoL;

      &hl(sub { print shift },
          [body => {bgcolor => 'white'},
           [p => 'Document body', ...], ...]);

    See EXAMPLE section below.

DESCRIPTION
    This module allows you to use Perl syntax to express HTML. The
    function `hl()' converts Perl list-of-list structures into HTML
    strings.

    The first argument to `hl()' is a callback function that's
    passed one argument: a fragment of generated HTML. This callback
    is invoked repeatedly with successive fragments until all the
    HTML is generated; the callback is responsible for assembling
    the fragments in the desired output location (e.g., a string or
    file).

    The remaining arguments to `hl()' are Perl objects representing
    HTML, as follows:

    [TAG, ...]
        TAG is a string (the name of an HTML element); remaining
        list items are any of the forms described herein.
        Corresponds to <TAG>...</TAG>. If TAG is an "empty element"
        according to `%HTML::Tagset::emptyElement', then the </TAG>
        is omitted.

    [TAG => {ATTR1 => VAL1, ATTR2 => VAL2, ...}, ...]
        Corresponds to <TAG ATTR1="VAL1" ATTR2="VAL2" ...>...</TAG>.
        (As above, </TAG> is omitted if TAG is an "empty element.")
        Each ATTR is a string. Each VAL is either a string, in which
        case the value gets HTML-entity-encoded when copied to the
        output, or a list reference containing a single string (viz.
        [VAL]) in which case the value is copied literally.

        Finally, for boolean-valued attributes, VAL may be
        `hl_bool(BOOLEAN)', where BOOLEAN is a Perl expression. If
        BOOLEAN is true, the attribute is included in the output;
        otherwise it's omitted.

    Any string
        Strings are copied verbatim to the output after entity-
        encoding.

    `hl_noquote(...)'
        Suppresses entity-encoding of its arguments.

    `hl_requote(...)'
        Reenables entity-encoding of its arguments (use it inside a
        call to `hl_noquote()').

    `hl_preserve(...)'
        Normally, HTML::LoL tries to optimize the whitespace in the
        HTML it emits (without changing the meaning of the HTML).
        This suppresses that behavior within its arguments.

    `hl_entity(NAME)'
        Includes the HTML character-entity named NAME.

EXAMPLE
      &hl(sub { print shift },
          [table => {border => 2, width => '80%'},
           [tr =>
            [td => {nowrap => &hl_bool(1)}, 'This & that'],
            [td => {nowrap => &hl_bool(0)}, '<b>This is not bold</b>'],
            [td => [b => 'But this is']],
            [td => &hl_noquote('<b>And so is this</b>')]]]);

    prints:

      <table width="80%" border="2">
       <tr>
        <td nowrap>This &amp; that</td>
        <td>&lt;b&gt;This is not bold&lt;/b&gt;</td>
        <td><b>But this is</b></td>
        <td><b>And so is this</b></td>
       </tr>
      </table>
