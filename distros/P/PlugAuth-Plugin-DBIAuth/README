    PlugAuth::Plugin::DBIAuth - DBI Authentication back end for PlugAuth

VERSION

    version 0.05

SYNOPSIS

    In your PlugAuth.conf file:

     ---
     plugins:
       - PlugAuth::Plugin::DBIAuth:
           db:
             dsn: 'dbi:SQLite:dbname=/path/to/dbfile.sqlite'
             user: ''
             pass: ''
           sql:
             init: 'CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (username VARCHAR UNIQUE, password VARCHAR)'
             check_credentials: 'SELECT password FROM users WHERE username = ?'
             all_users: 'SELECT username FROM users'

DESCRIPTION

    This plugin provides an authentication mechanism for PlugAuth using any
    database supported by DBI as a backend. It is configured as above, with
    two hashes, db and sql.

 encryption

    Specifies the encryption method to use. This is only used when creating
    new users, or changing their passwords. Existing passwords will remain
    in their existing formats and will be decrypted automatically in the
    correct format.

    If provided, must be one of:

      * unix

      Traditional UNIX crypt()

      * unix_md5

      UNIX MD5

      * apache_md5 [ default ]

      Apache MD5

 db

    The db hash provides the required parameters for the plugin needed to
    connect to the database.

  dsn

    The DNS passed into DBI. See the documentation for your database driver
    for the exact format (DBD::SQLite, DBD::Pg, DBD::mysql ... ).

  user

    The database user.

  pass

    The database password.

 sql

    The sql hash provides SQL statements which are executed for each
    operation. They are all optional. The examples shown here assumes a
    simple table with usernames and passwords:

     CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (
       username VARCHAR UNIQUE,
       password VARCHAR
     );

  init

    Arbitrary SQL executed when the plugin is started.

  check_credentials

    The SQL statement used to fetch the encrypted password of a user. The
    username is the first bind value when executed. Example:

     SELECT password FROM users WHERE username = ?

  all_users

    The SQL statement used to fetch the list of users. Example:

     SELECT username FROM users

  create_user

    The SQL statement used to create a new user. Example:

     INSERT INTO users (username, password) VALUES (?,?)

  change_password

    The SQL statement used to change the password of an existing user.
    Example:

     UPDATE users SET password = ? WHERE username = ?

  delete_user

    The SQL statement used to delete an existing user. Example:

     DELETE FROM users WHERE username = ?

  dbh

    Returns the dbh handle used to query the database.

  created_encrypted_password

    Given a new plain text password, return the encrypted version.
