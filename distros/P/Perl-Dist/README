NAME
    Perl::Dist - Perl Distribution Creation Toolkit

DESCRIPTION
    The Perl::Dist namespace encompasses creation of pre-packaged, binary
    distributions of Perl, primarily as executable installers for Win32.

    Packages in this namespace include both "builders" and "distributions".

    Builder packages automate the generation of distributions.

    Distribution packages contain configuration files for a particular
    builder, extra files to be bundled with the pre-packaged binary, and
    documentation.

    Distribution namespaces are also recommended to consolidate bug
    reporting using http://rt.cpan.org/.

    *Distribution packages should not contain the pre-packaged install files
    themselves.*

  BUILDERS
    At the present time the primarily builder module is Perl::Dist::Inno.

  DISTRIBUTIONS
    Currently available distributions include:

    *   Perl::Dist::Vanilla -- An experimental "core Perl" distribution
        intended for distribution developers.

    *   Perl::Dist::Strawberry -- A practical Win32 Perl release for
        experienced Perl developers familiar with Perl on Unix environments
        with full CPAN capabilities.

        Strawberry Perl is considered stable, and can be downloaded from the
        Strawberry Perl website at <http://strawberryperl.com/>.

    *   Perl::Dist::Chocolate -- A concept distribution that bundled a large
        "standard library" collection of CPAN modules, and provides a
        variety of WxWindows-based GUI tools.

    *   Perl::Dist::Bootstrap -- Bootstrap Perl is a Perl 5.8.8 distribution
        designed for people that are themselves creating Perl distributions.

        It installs to a disk location out of the way and not used by any
        "end-user" distributions, and comes with Perl::Dist and support
        modules pre-bundled.

ROADMAP
    Perl::Dist::Inno, based on Inno Setup, is working well, but has a
    limited lifespace, as it is not capable of produces Windows native .msi
    installer files.

    Ultimately this means that Perl::Dist will see the additional of an
    alternative module based on Nullsoft or Wix that allows the creation of
    .msi files (a major feature for corporate users).

    Various other features are able to be implemented within the Inno Setup
    feature set, and include:

    *   Bug-squashing Win32 compatibility problems in popular modules

    *   Customisable installation path.

    *   Support installation paths with spaces and other weird characters.

    *   Restore support for .exe installation instead of .zip.

    *   Better uninstall support and upgradability.
