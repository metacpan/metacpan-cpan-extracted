=head1 DESCRIPTION

This package aims to provide a standard for documenting L<Venus> derived
software projects, a framework writing tests, test automation, and
documentation generation. This package will automatically exports C<true>,
C<false>, and L</test> keyword functions.

=cut

=head1 SPECIFICATION

This section describes the specification format used by L<Venus::Test> to
generate documentation and automate testing for Perl packages. The
specification uses specially formatted POD blocks that serve as both
human-readable documentation and executable test cases.

B<Note:> When code blocks are evaluated, "redefined" warnings are automatically
disabled.

=head2 Overview

A specification document consists of POD blocks that describe a package. The
blocks are organized into the following categories:

=over 4

=item * B<Required Blocks> - Must be present in every specification

=item * B<Package Structure Blocks> - Define inheritance and dependencies

=item * B<API Blocks> - Document attributes, methods, functions, etc.

=item * B<Supporting Blocks> - Signatures, examples, metadata, and exceptions

=item * B<Feature Blocks> - Special capabilities and operators

=item * B<Document Control Blocks> - Layout and partial inclusions

=item * B<Project Information Blocks> - Authors, license, version

=head1 REQUIRED BLOCKS

These blocks must be present in every specification document.

=head2 name

  =name

  Example

  =cut

  $test->for('name');

The C<name> block should contain the package name. This is tested for
loadability.

=head2 abstract

  =abstract

  Example Test Documentation

  =cut

  $test->for('abstract');

The C<abstract> block should contain a subtitle describing the package. This is
tested for existence.

=head2 tagline

  =tagline

  Example Class

  =cut

  $test->for('tagline');

The C<tagline> block should contain a 2-5 word description of the package,
which will be prepended to the name as a full description of the package.

=head2 synopsis

  =synopsis

    use Example;

    my $example = Example->new;

    # bless(..., "Example")

  =cut

  $test->for('synopsis', sub {
    my ($tryable) = @_;
    $tryable->result;
  });

The C<synopsis> block should contain the normative usage of the package. This
is tested for existence. This block should be written in a way that allows it
to be evaled successfully and should return a value.

=head2 description

  =description

  This package provides an example class.

  =cut

  $test->for('description');

The C<description> block should contain a description of the package and its
behaviors.

=head1 PACKAGE BLOCKS

These optional blocks define the package's relationships and dependencies.

=head2 includes

  =includes

  function: eg

  method: prepare
  method: execute

  =cut

  $test->for('includes');

The C<includes> block should contain a list of C<function>, C<method>, and/or
C<routine> names in the format of C<$type: $name>. Empty (or commented out)
lines are ignored. Each function, method, and/or routine is tested to be
documented properly, i.e. has the requisite counterparts (e.g. signature and at
least one example block). Also, the package must recognize that each exists.

=head2 libraries

  =libraries

  Venus::Check

  =cut

  $test->for('libraries');

The C<libraries> block should contain a list of packages, each describing how
particular type names used within function and method signatures will be
validated. These packages are tested for loadability.

=head2 inherits

  =inherits

  Venus::Core::Class

  =cut

  $test->for('inherits');

The C<inherits> block should contain a list of parent packages. These packages
are tested for loadability.

=head2 integrates

  =integrates

  Venus::Role::Catchable
  Venus::Role::Throwable

  =cut

  $test->for('integrates');

The C<integrates> block should contain a list of packages that are involved in
the behavior of the main package (typically roles). These packages are not
automatically tested.

=head1 API BLOCKS

These blocks document the package's interface: attributes, methods, functions,
messages, and routines. Each API block follows a common pattern requiring a
description block, a signature block, and at least one example block.

=head2 Common Pattern

All API blocks (attribute, function, message, method, routine) follow this
structure:

  =$type $name               # Description of the $type
  =signature $name           # Type signature
  =metadata $name            # Optional metadata (since, deprecated, etc.)
  =example-1 $name           # First example (required)
  =example-2 $name           # Additional examples (optional)
  =raise $name $error        # Document exceptions (optional)
  =raise $name $error $id    # Exception with named error (optional)
  ...

The C<signature> block should contain a routine signature in the form of
C<$signature : $return_type>, where C<$signature> is a valid typed signature
and C<$return_type> is any valid L<Venus::Check> expression.

The C<example-$number> block should contain valid Perl code and return a value.
Examples can include a "magic" comment to incorporate other code:

=over 4

=item * C<# given: synopsis> - Include the synopsis code

=item * C<# given: example-$number $name> - Include another example's code

=back

=head2 attribute

  =attribute name

  The name attribute is read-write, optional, and holds a string.

  =signature name

    name(string $value) (string)

  =metadata name

  since: 1.0.0

  =example-1 name

    # given: synopsis

    my $name = $example->name;

    # "..."

  =cut

  $test->for('attribute', 'name');

  $test->for('example', 1, 'name', sub {
    my ($tryable) = @_;
    $tryable->result;
  });

The C<attribute> block should contain a description of the attribute and its
purpose. Each attribute is tested and must be recognized to exist.

=head2 method

  =method prepare

  The prepare method prepares for execution.

  =signature prepare

    prepare() (boolean)

  =example-1 prepare

    # given: synopsis

    my $prepare = $example->prepare;

    # "..."

  =cut

  $test->for('method', 'prepare');

  $test->for('example', 1, 'prepare', sub {
    my ($tryable) = @_;
    $tryable->result;
  });

The C<method> block should contain a description of the method and its purpose.
Each method is tested and must be recognized to exist.

=head2 function

  =function eg

  The eg function returns a new instance of Example.

  =signature eg

    eg() (Example)

  =example-1 eg

    # given: synopsis

    my $example = eg();

    # "..."

  =cut

  $test->for('function', 'eg');

  $test->for('example', 1, 'eg', sub {
    my ($tryable) = @_;
    $tryable->result;
  });

The C<function> block should contain a description of the function and its
purpose. Each function is tested and must be recognized to exist.

=head2 routine

  =routine process

  The process routine processes and returns data.

  =signature process

    process(any @args) (any)

  =example-1 process

    # given: synopsis

    my $result = $example->process;

    # "..."

  =cut

  $test->for('routine', 'process');

  $test->for('example', 1, 'process', sub {
    my ($tryable) = @_;
    $tryable->result;
  });

The C<routine> block documents a subroutine that can be called as either a
function or a method. It follows the same pattern as method and function
blocks.

=head2 message

  =message accept

  The accept message represents acceptance.

  =signature accept

    accept(any @args) (string)

  =example-1 accept

    # given: synopsis

    my $accept = $example->accept;

    # "..."

  =cut

  $test->for('message', 'accept');

  $test->for('example', 1, 'accept', sub {
    my ($tryable) = @_;
    $tryable->result;
  });

The C<message> block documents a method that returns a message string, typically
used for error messages or localization. It follows the same pattern as other
API blocks.

=head1 SUPPORTING BLOCKS

These blocks provide additional context for API documentation.

=head2 signature

  =signature prepare

    prepare() (boolean)

  =cut

  $test->for('signature', 'prepare');

The C<signature> block should contain a routine signature in the form of
C<$signature : $return_type>, where C<$signature> is a valid typed signature
and C<$return_type> is any valid L<Venus::Check> expression.

=head2 example

  =example-1 name

    # given: synopsis

    my $name = $example->name;

    # "..."

  =cut

  $test->for('example', 1, 'name', sub {
    my ($tryable) = @_;
    $tryable->result;
  });

The C<example-$number $name> block should contain valid Perl code and return a
value. The block may contain a "magic" comment in the form of C<given:
synopsis> or C<given: example-$number $name> which if present will include the
given code example(s) with the evaluation of the current block.

=head2 metadata

  =metadata prepare

  {since => "1.2.3"}

  =cut

  $test->for('metadata', 'prepare');

The C<metadata $name> block should contain a stringified hashref containing
Perl data structures used in the rendering of the package's documentation.
Metadata can also be specified as flat key/value pairs:

  =metadata prepare

  introduced: 1.2.3
  deprecated: 2.0.0

  =cut

=head2 raise

  =raise execute Venus::Error

    # given: synopsis

    $example->operation; # throw exception

    # Error

  =cut

  $test->for('raise', 'execute', 'Venus::Error', sub {
    my ($tryable) = @_;
    my $error = $tryable->error->result;
    $test->is_error($error);
  });

The C<raise $name $error> block documents an exception that may be thrown by
an API (attribute, function, method, or routine). The parameters are:

=over 4

=item * C<$name> - The name of the attribute, function, method, or routine that may throw the exception.

=item * C<$error> - The error class or package that may be caught (e.g., C<Venus::Error>, C<Example::Error>).

=item * C<$id> (optional) - An error name for further classification within the error class.

=back

The C<$error> represents the exception class that calling code can catch using
a try/catch mechanism. This links the API documentation to error handling
expectations.

An optional C<$id> can be appended to specify a named error. Venus::Error
objects support named errors for further classification:

  =raise execute Venus::Error on.unknown

    # given: synopsis

    $example->operation; # throw exception

    # Error (on.unknown)

  =cut

  $test->for('raise', 'execute', 'Venus::Error', 'on.unknown', sub {
    my ($tryable) = @_;
    my $error = $tryable->error->result;
    $test->is_error($error);
    $test->is($error->name, 'on.unknown');
  });

When C<$id> is provided, it indicates a specific named error within the error
class, allowing for more granular error documentation and handling.

=head1 FEATURE BLOCKS

These blocks document special capabilities, errors, and operator overloads.

=head2 feature

  =feature noop

  This package provides no particularly useful features.

  =example-1 noop

    # given: synopsis

    my $feature = $example->feature;

    # "..."

  =cut

  $test->for('feature');

  $test->for('example', 1, 'noop', sub {
    my ($tryable) = @_;
    $tryable->result;
  });

The C<feature $name> block should contain a description of the feature(s) the
package enables, and can include an C<example-$number $name> block to ensure
the feature described works as expected.

=head2 error

  =error error_on_unknown

  This package may raise an error_on_unknown error.

  =example-1 error_on_unknown

    # given: synopsis

    my $error = $example->catch('error', {
      with => 'error_on_unknown',
    });

    # "..."

  =cut

  $test->for('error', 'error_on_unknown');

  $test->for('example', 1, 'error_on_unknown', sub {
    my ($tryable) = @_;
    $tryable->result;
  });

The C<error $name> block should contain a description of the error the package
may raise, and can include an C<example-$number $name> block to ensure the
error is raised and caught.

=head2 operator

  =operator ("")

  This package overloads the C<""> operator.

  =example-1 ("")

    # given: synopsis

    my $string = "$example";

    # "..."

  =cut

  $test->for('operator', '("")');

  $test->for('example', 1, '("")', sub {
    my ($tryable) = @_;
    $tryable->result;
  });

The C<operator $name> block should contain a description of the overloaded
operation the package performs, and can include an C<example-$number $name>
block to ensure the operation is functioning properly.

=head1 CONTROL BLOCKS

These blocks control how documentation is rendered.

=head2 encoding

  =encoding

  utf8

  =cut

  $test->for('encoding');

The C<encoding> block should contain the appropriate
L<encoding|perlpod/encoding-encodingname>.

=head2 layout

  =layout

  encoding
  name
  synopsis
  description
  attributes: attribute
  authors
  license

  =cut

  $test->for('layout');

The C<layout> block should contain a list of blocks to render using L</render>,
in the order they should be rendered.

=head2 partials

  =partials

  t/path/to/other.t: present: authors
  t/path/to/other.t: present: license

  =cut

  $test->for('partials');

The C<partials> block should contain references to other marked-up test files
in the form of C<$file: $method: $section>, which will call the C<$method> on a
L<Venus::Test> instance for the C<$file> and include the results in-place as
part of the rendering of the current file.

=head1 PROJECT BLOCKS

These blocks provide metadata about the project.

=head2 authors

  =authors

  Awncorp, C<awncorp@cpan.org>

  =cut

  $test->for('authors');

The C<authors> block should contain text describing the authors of the package.

=head2 license

  =license

  No license granted.

  =cut

  $test->for('license');

The C<license> block should contain a link and/or description of the license
governing the package.

=head2 project

  =project

  https://github.com/awncorp/example

  =cut

  $test->for('project');

The C<project> block should contain a description and/or links for the
package's project.

=head2 version

  =version

  1.2.3

  =cut

  $test->for('version');

The C<version> block should contain a valid version number for the package.

=head1 TESTING

This framework provides automated subtests based on the package specification,
but also provides hooks for manual testing when automation is not sufficient.

=head2 Basic Testing

For simple blocks, testing verifies existence:

  $test->for('name');
  $test->for('abstract');
  $test->for('description');

=head2 Testing with Callbacks

Code examples can be evaluated and returned using a callback for further
testing:

  $test->for('synopsis', sub {
    my ($tryable) = @_;

    my $result = $tryable->result;

    # must return truthy to continue
    $result;
  });

=head2 Exception Testing

Because code examples are returned as L<Venus::Try> objects, capturing and
testing exceptions is straightforward:

  $test->for('synopsis', sub {
    my ($tryable) = @_;

    # catch exception thrown by the synopsis
    $tryable->catch('Path::Find::Error', sub {
      return $_[0];
    });

    # test the exception
    my $result = $tryable->result;
    ok $result->isa('Path::Find::Error'), 'exception caught';

    # must return truthy to continue
    $result;
  });

=head2 Testing Examples

The C<example> method evaluates a given example and returns the result as a
L<Venus::Try> object. The first argument is the example number:

  $test->for('example', 1, 'children', sub {
    my ($tryable) = @_;

    my $result = $tryable->result;

    # must return truthy to continue
    $result;
  });

=head2 Testing Features

The C<feature> method evaluates a documented feature and returns the result as
a L<Venus::Try> object:

  $test->for('feature', 'export-path-make', sub {
    my ($tryable) = @_;

    ok my $result = $tryable->result, 'result ok';

    # must return truthy to continue
    $result;
  });

=head2 Benefits

The test automation and documentation generation enabled through this framework
makes it easy to maintain source/test/documentation parity. This also increases
reusability and reduces the need for complicated state and test setup.

=cut

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

This package has the following attributes:

=cut

=head2 file

  file(string $data) (string)

The file attribute is read-write, accepts C<(string)> values, and is required.

L<Venus::Role::Encaseable>

=cut

=head1 FUNCTIONS

This package provides the following functions:

=cut

=head2 test

  test(string $file) (Venus::Test)

The test function is exported automatically and returns a L<Venus::Test> object
for the test file given.

I<Since C<0.09>>

=over 4

=item test example 1

  package main;

  use Venus::Test;

  my $test = test 't/Venus_Test.t';

  # bless(..., "Venus::Test")

=back

=cut

=head1 METHODS

This package provides the following methods:

=cut

=head2 auto

  auto(string $name, any @args) (any)

The auto method gets or sets environment variables that control automatic
behaviors in the testing framework. When called with just a name, it returns
the current value of the corresponding environment variable. When called with
a name and value, it sets the environment variable. The environment variable
name is derived from the name parameter as C<VENUS_TEST_AUTO_${NAME}>.

Supported auto settings:

=over 4

=item * C<bailout> - When truthy, bails out of testing on the first error.

=item * C<render> - When truthy, automatically renders POD when L</done> is
called.

=item * C<scrub> - When truthy, uses L<Venus::Space/scrub> to clean up packages
created in example code for testing.

=item * C<unpatch> - When truthy, uses L<Venus::Space/unpatch> (via
L</unpatch>) to restore any existing monkey-patching on the package associated
with the test.
