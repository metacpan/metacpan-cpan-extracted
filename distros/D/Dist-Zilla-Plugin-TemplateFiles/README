NAME

    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::TemplateFiles - use files as templates to build a
    distribution

SYNOPSIS

    In your dist.ini:

      [TemplateFiles]
          filename = README
          filename = path/to/other/file

DESCRIPTION

    Utilize Text::Template to turn certain files into templates. Each
    template has available to it the $dist variable that is the instance of

    relative to the root of the build.
