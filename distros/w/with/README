DESCRIPTION
    This pragma lets you define a default object against with methods will
    be called in the current scope when possible. It is enabled by the "use
    with \$obj" idiom (note that you must pass a reference to the object).
    If you "use with" several times in the current scope, the default object
    will be the last specified one.

HOW DOES IT WORK
    The main problem to address is that lexical scoping and source
    modification can only occur at compile time, while object creation and
    method resolution happen at run-time.

    The "use with \$obj" statement stores an address to the variable $obj in
    the "with" field of the hints hash "%^H". It also starts a source filter
    that replaces function calls with calls to "with::defer", passing the
    name of the original function as the first argument. When the replaced
    function has a prototype or is part of the core, the call is deferred to
    a corresponding wrapper generated in the "with" namespace. Some keywords
    that couldn't possibly be replaced are also completely skipped. "no
    with" undefines the hint and deletes the source filter, stopping any
    subsequent modification in the current scope.

    When the script is executed, deferred calls first fetch the default
    object back from the address stored into the hint. If the object "->can"
    the original function name, a method call is issued. If not, the calling
    namespace is inspected for a subroutine with the proper name, and if
    it's present the program "goto"s into it. If that fails too, the core
    function with the same name is recalled if possible, or an "Undefined
    subroutine" error is thrown.

IGNORED KEYWORDS
    A call will never be dispatched to a method whose name is one of :

        my our local sub do eval goto return
        if else elsif unless given when or and 
        while until for foreach next redo last continue
        eq ne lt gt le ge cmp
        map grep system exec sort print say
        new
        STDIN STDOUT STDERR

EXPORT
    No function or constant is exported by this pragma.

CAVEATS
    Most likely slow. Almost surely non thread-safe. Contains source
    filters, hence brittle. Messes with the dreadful prototypes. Crazy. Will
    have bugs.

    Don't put anything on the same line of "use with \$obj" or "no with".

    When there's a function in the caller namespace that has a core function
    name, and when no method with the same name is present, the ambiguity is
    resolved in favor of the caller namespace. That's different from the
    usual perl semantics where "sub push; push @a, 1" gets resolved to
    CORE::push.

    If a method has the same name as a prototyped function in the caller
    namespace, and if a called is deferred to the method, it will have its
    arguments passed by value.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
    A fair part of this module is widely inspired from Filter::Simple
    (especially "FILTER_ONLY"), but a complete integration was needed in
    order to add hints support and more placeholder patterns.
