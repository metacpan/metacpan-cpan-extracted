Revision history for Email-MIME-Kit

3.000007  2023-01-09 20:33:45-05:00 America/New_York
        - update packaging and metadata
        - minimum required Perl is now v5.12

3.000006  2018-03-10 16:45:07-05:00 America/New_York
        - add some docs on cid_for (thanks, Kaitlyn Parkhurst!)

3.000005  2016-09-20 11:22:25-04:00 America/New_York
        - set up kit_reader and manifest_reader with a helper attribute instead
          of the weird and rarely-seen Moose "initializer" system

3.000004  2016-08-03 22:48:27-04:00 America/New_York
        - require a newer Email::MIME so we can rely on the header_raw method

3.000003  2016-08-03 09:08:35-04:00 America/New_York
        - manifest.json is now properly decoded while being read, so
          UTF-8 strings in the manifest.json are treated the same way as
          \u.... sequences.  If you had been doubly-UTF-8-encoding your
          manifest.json to work around this bug, your code is now broken
          because my code is now fixed.

3.000002  2015-02-19 11:02:14-05:00 America/New_York
        - immutabilize more classes

3.000001  2014-12-01 14:10:12-05:00 America/New_York
          [BREAKING CHANGES]
        - content read from disk (templates, for example) is now decoded
          as UTF-8 if and only if the content type for which it is being used
          is text/*
        - for more information on this change, consult the "ENCODING" section
          of the documentation for Email::MIME::Kit

          [BUG FIXES]
        - non-text parts are no longer padded with CRLFs

2.102015  2014-11-02 08:59:04-05:00 America/New_York
        - read kit entries in binary mode for the sake of Win32 (thanks,
          Octavian Rasnita!)

2.102014  2014-06-06 08:24:52-04:00 America/New_York
        - break a circular reference in the assembler (thanks, Charlie
          Garrison)

2.102012  2013-04-08 15:29:38 America/New_York
          make tests for header encoding less specific: the header must be
          encoded, but we don't mind if it's B or Q

2.102011  2012-07-25 10:58:12 America/New_York
          stop failing with changed crlf detection

2.102010  2010-07-20 15:00:43 America/Los_Angeles
          eliminate use of auto_deref on some private attributes

2.101960  2010-07-15 09:04:53 America/New_York
          improve the chances of correctly bracketing message-ids
          avoid re-setting already set message-ids

2.093070  2009-11-03
          improve handling of header and body encoding

2.091920  2009-07-10
          add missing (test) prereq Test::Deep
          fix cid_for callbacks to exclude the content-id brackets (RT 47787)
