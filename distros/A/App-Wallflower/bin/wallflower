=head1 NAME

wallflower - Sorry I can't dance, I'm hanging on to my friend's purse

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 wallflower [options] [arguments]

=head1 OPTIONS AND ARGUMENTS

In typical L<Getopt::Long> fashion, all options can be abbreviated
as long as the shorter version is unambiguous.

=head2 Required options

 --application <app>        Pathname of the .psgi Plack application file

=head2 Other options

 --destination <path>       Directory for saving generated files
 --directory   <path>       (default: current dir), must exist

 --environment <name>       Plack environment for running the application,
                            usually development, deployment, or test
                            (default: deployment)

 --index       <filename>   Name of index file for URLs ending in /
                            (default: index.html)

 --follow                   Do/don't follow links in (X)HTML and CSS pages
 --no-follow                (default = follow)

 --filter                   Arguments are files containing lists of URLs
 --files
 -F

 --url         <url>        URL of the production site. If the URL has
                            a path component, the application will be
                            "mounted" there.

 --host        <hostname> * Process URLs with one of these hostnames in
                            addition to hostame-less ones and ones using
                            localhost (default is only hostame-less and
                            localhost ones), can include * as a wildcard,
                            like *.example.com. The hostname used in the
                            --url option is automatically added to the list,

 --errors                   Show URLs that returned a non-200 status code
 --verbose                  Show URLs that returned a 200 status code
 --quiet                    Disable both --errors and --verbose
                            (which are enabled by default)

 --include     <path>     * Library paths to add to @INC, delimited with your
 --INC         <path>     * OS' path separator ($Config::Config{path_sep})

 --help                     Print a short help summary and exit
 --manual                   Print the full manual page and exit
 --tutorial                 Print the tutorial and exit

Options marked with * can be repeated as necessary.

=head2 Arguments

Arguments are either URLs or (if I<--filter> is specified) files containing
URLs (one per line) or lines containing only spaces or where the first
non-space is a #. If no arguments are present, / (or standard input if
I<--filter> is specified) is used instead.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<wallflower> turns your L<Plack> application into a static (read-only)
web site.

While this isn't suitable for all applications, it makes sense for many
uses. Most web sites are largely static. With no
way for the site's users to update its content (via forms, comments, etc)
the only changes to the web site come from sources that you control
(including the database) and that are accessible in your development
environment.

Using a web framework like L<Dancer> (or any other) for a static web
site is very useful, because it lets you use all the features of the
framework on that site. Think of it as I<extreme caching>.

A possible dataflow would be processing forms on your development server
(maybe to update a local database), then I<publish> as static pages
a I<subset> of all the URLs the application supports.

Turning that application into a real static site (a set of pages
to upload to a static web server) is just a matter of generating all
possible URLs for the static site and saving the corresponding pages to files.

B<wallflower> does just that. It reads a list of URLs, strips off
any query strings, issues HTTP C<GET> requests for each in turn and
saves the response body to a file with a name derived from the request
pathinfo, under the directory specified by the B<--destination> option.

Note that B<wallflower> is not meant for use as an offline browsing tool:
among other things, it doesn't rewrite link URLs to match the pathnames of
the saved pages.

=head1 EXAMPLE

The web site created by C<dancer -a mywebapp> is the perfect example.

The complete list of URLs needed to view the site is:

    /
    /404.html
    /500.html
    /css/error.css
    /css/style.css
    /favicon.ico
    /images/perldancer-bg.jpg
    /images/perldancer.jpg
    /javascripts/jquery.js

Passing this list to B<wallflower> gives the following result:

    $ wallflower -a bin/app.pl -d /tmp -F urls.txt
    200 / => /tmp/output/index.html [5367]
    200 /404.html => /tmp/output/404.html [499]
    200 /500.html => /tmp/output/500.html [510]
    200 /css/error.css => /tmp/output/css/error.css [1210]
    200 /css/style.css => /tmp/output/css/style.css [2850]
    404 /favicon.ico
    404 /images/perldancer-bg.jpg
    404 /images/perldancer.jpg
    200 /javascripts/jquery.js => /tmp/output/javascripts/jquery.js [248235]

Note that URLs with a path ending in a C</> are considered directories
and have the default I<index> filename appended, and that wallflower will
behave unpredictably if the site contains pages accessible through URLs
ending both in F<foo> and F<foo/>. This is arguably a bug, but it's
unclear where to fix it, or if it can be fixed at all. See
L<Wallflower::Tutorial/URI SEMANTICS COMPARED TO DIRECTORY SEMANTICS> for
background on this.

Any URL returning a status other than C<200> will be logged,
but not saved. URLs returning a C<301> status (moved) are followed.

Only the path component is used to fetch the response, so URLs
pointing to other sites will likely return a C<404> (or fetch the
I<local> page if it exists in the application).

=head1 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

L<wallflower> started as a neat idea in a discussion between Marc
Chantreux, Alexis Sukrieh, Franck Cuny and myself in the hallway of
OSDC.fr (L<http://osdc.fr/>) 2010, after Alexis' talk about L<Dancer>.

Because a good pun should never be wasted, a first version of the
program has been included in L<Dancer> since version 1.3000_01.
Since it wasn't maintained, it has been removed in version 1.3110,
after the first release of L<App::Wallflower>.

The idea for L<App::Wallflower> owes a lot to Vincent Pit who, while
I was talking about L<wallflower> and L<Dancer> with Marc on IRC in
January 2011, noted that this file generation scheme had
nothing to do with L<Dancer> and much more with L<Plack>.

L<wallflower> treats all L<Plack> applications equally, even if the
first version of the program was targetting L<Dancer> only.
