NAME

    Archive::Libarchive::Compress - Recursively archive a directory (using
    libarchive)

VERSION

    version 0.01

SYNOPSIS

     use Archive::Libarchive::Compress;
    
     my $w = Archive::Libarchive::Compress->new( filename => 'foo.tar' );
     $w->compress( from => '.' );

DESCRIPTION

    This module recursively archives a directory to either a file or to
    memory. This module does not store directory structure, just the files,
    so an empty directory will not be represented in the resulting archive.

CONSTRUCTOR

 new

     my $w = Archive::Libarchive::Compress->new(%args);

    Exactly one of filename and memory are required. All other arguments
    are optional.

    entry

      Callback function called for each entry before it is written to the
      archive. The entry is passed in as an instance of
      Archive::Libarchive::Entry. If this callback returns a false value,
      then the entry will not be written to the archive.

       my $w = Archive::Libarchive::Compress->new(
         filename => 'foo.tar',
         entry => sub ($e) {
           # skip "hidden" files
           return $e->pathname !~ /^\./;
         },
       )

      You may also modify the entry, before it gets written. This can be
      useful for modifying stored file properties like the owner, group or
      permissions that you may not want in the archive.

    filename

      The name of the archive filename to create.

    memory

      Scalar reference which will be used as a buffer to write the archive
      to memory. This scalar does not have to be pre-allocated, so this
      will work:

       my $out = '';
       my $w = Archive::Libarchive::Compress->new( memory => \$out );

    prep

      Callback function called before the archive has been opened. An
      instance of Archive::Libarchive::ArchiveWrite will be passed in. This
      is useful for specifying a format for the archive. If not provided,
      then pax restricted format will be used. (This is uncompressed and
      widely supported). If you wanted to for example use GNU tar format
      compressed with bzip2:

       my $w = Archive::Libarchive::Compress->new(
         filename => 'foo.tar.bz2',
         prep => sub ($archive) {
           $archive->set_format_gnutar;
           $archive->add_filter_bzip2;
         },
       );

      See Archive::Libarchive::ArchiveWrite for more details.

METHODS

 filename

     my $filename = $w->filename;

    Returns the Archive filename.

 from

     my $from = $w->from;

    Returns the directory that was archived. If "compress" hasn't been
    called yet, then it will return undef.

 compress

     $w->compress( from => $dir );
     $w->compress;

    Recursively archives the directory. If $dir is not provided, then the
    current directory will be used.
