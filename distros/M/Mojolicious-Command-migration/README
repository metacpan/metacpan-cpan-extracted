=head2 status
 
  $ app migration status
  Schema version: 21
  Deployed database is 20

Returns the state of the deployed database (if it is deployed) and the state of the current schema version. Sends this as a string to STDOUT

=head2 prepare

Makes deployment files for the current schema. If deployment files exist, will fail unless you "overwrite_migrations".

  $ app migration prepare
  Schema version: 21

  # no changes
  $ app migration prepare
  Schema version: 21
  Nothing to upgrade. Exit

=head2 install

Installs either the current schema version (if already prepared) or the target version specified via any to_version flags.

If you try to install to a database that has already been installed (not empty), you'll get an error. Use flag force to set current database to schema version without changes database.
