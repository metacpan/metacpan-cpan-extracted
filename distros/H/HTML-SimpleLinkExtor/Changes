	(so it needs to know where they stop)

1.18 - Sat Nov 24 04:44:09 2007
	* Cleanups for the move from CVS to SVN
	* No need to upgrade

1.17 - Sun Mar 18 22:32:01 2007

1.16 - Tue Jan  9 22:07:34 2007

	from the input files, stdin, or a file of the net.

	* Happy New Year!

1.13 - Sat May 27 02:21:37 2006

	the module will parse. You don't have to fool with the internal
	hash or email me to make changes anymore!

1.12 - Wed Jan 11 00:51:33 2006
	* rt.cpan.org: Ticket #16942: A bug in my URL resolution code
	only resolved the last URL found in a tag. Now the code goes through
	all the value and resolves each that it thinks should be a URL
	* Everyone should upgrade

1.11 - Mon Aug 22 22:44:18 2005
	* added support for iframe src extraction
	* no need to upgrade unless you need this feature

1.10 - Tue Aug 16 14:42:24 2005
	* added a clear_links() method so you can start fresh if you
	want to parse multiple files with the same parser object. This
	does not affect previous behavior, so old scripts should be
	safe.
