DESCRIPTION
    This module provides fast functions and methods to convert between
    arbitrary number bases from 2 (binary) thru 65535.

    This module is pure Perl, has no external dependencies, and is backward
    compatible with old versions of Perl 5.

PREFERRED USE
    Setting up the conversion parameters, context and error checking consume
    a significant portion of the execution time of a single base conversion.
    These operations are performed each time cnv is called as a function.

    Using method calls eliminates a large portion of this overhead and will
    improve performance for repetitive conversions. See the benchmarks
    sub-directory in this distribution.

BUILT IN NUMBER SETS
    Number set variants courtesy of the authors of Math::Base:Cnv and
    Math::BaseConvert.

USAGE
    * $converted = cnv($number,[from],[to])
        SCALAR context: array context covered later in this document.

        To preserve similarity to other similar base conversion modules, cnv
        returns the converted number string with SIGN if both the input and
        output base strings are in known signed set of bases in this module.

        In the case of binary, octal, hex, all leading base designator
        strings such as '0b','0', '0x' are automatically stripped from the
        input. Base designator strings are NOT applied to the output.

        The context of base FROM and TO is optional and flexible.

        Unconditional conversion from decimal to HEX [upper case]

                $converted = cnv($number);

        Example conversion from octal to default HEX [upper case] with
        different context for the 'octal' designator.

          base as a number
                $converted = cnv($number,8);

          base as a function    (imported)
                $converted = cnv($number,oct);

          base as text
                $converted = convbase($number,'oct');

        Conversion to/from arbitrary bases i.e.

          $converted = cnv($number); # dec -> hex (default)
          $converted = cnv($number,oct);        # oct to HEX
          $converted = cnv($number,10,HEX);     # dec to uc HEX
          $converted = cnv($number,10,hex);     # dec to lc hex
          $converted = cnv($number,dec,hex);#    same

                pointer notation
          $converted = cnv($number, oct => dec);

          $converted = cnv($number,10 => 23); # dec to base23
          $converted = cnv($number,23 => 5);  # b23 to base5
          etc...

    * $bc = new Math::Base::Convert([from],[to]);
        This method has the same usage and syntax for FROM and TO as cnv
        above.

        Setup for unconditional conversion from HEX to decimal

                $bc = new Math::Base::Convert();

        Example conversion from octal to decimal

          base number
                $bc = new Math::Base::Convert(8);

          base function (imported)
                $bc = new Math::Base::Convert(oct);

          base text
                $bc = new Math::Base::Convert('oct')

        The number conversion for any of the above:

        NOTE: iterative conversions using a method pointer are ALWAYS faster
        than calling cnv as a function.

                $converted = $bc->cnv($number);

    * $converted = cnvpre($number,[from],[to])
        Same as cnv except that base descriptor PREfixes are applied to
        binary, octal, and hexadecimal output strings.

    * $converted = cnvabs($number,[from],[to])
        Same as cnv except that the ABSolute value of the number string is
        returned without SIGN is returned. i.e. just the raw string.

    * ($sign,$prefix,$string) = cnv($number,[$from,[$to]])
    * ($sign,$prefix,$string) = cnv($number,[$from,[$to]])
    * ($sign,$prefix,$string) = cnv($number,[$from,[$to]])
        ARRAY context:

        All three functions return the same items in array context.

          sign          the sign of the input number string

          prefix        the prefix which would be applied to output

          string        the raw output string

    * $basemap = basemap(base);
    * $basemap = $bc->basemap(base);
        This function / method returns a pointer to a hash that maps the
        keys of a base to its numeric value for base conversion. It accepts
        base in any of the forms described for cnv.

        The return basemap includes upper and lower case variants of the the
        number base in cases such as hex where upper and lower case a..f,
        A..F map to the same numeric value for base conversion.

          i.e. $hex_ptr = {
                0  => 0,
                1  => 1,
                2  => 2,
                3  => 3,
                4  => 4,
                5  => 5,
                6  => 6,
                7  => 7,
                8  => 8,
                9  => 9,
                A  => 10,
                B  => 11,
                C  => 12,
                D  => 13,
                E  => 14,
                F  => 15,
                a  => 10,
                b  => 11,
                c  => 12,
                d  => 13,
                e  => 14,
                f  => 15
          };

BENCHMARKS
    Math::Base::Convert includes 2 development and one real world benchmark
    sequences included in the test suite. Benchmark results for a 500mhz
    system can be found in the 'benchmarks' source directory.

      make test BENCHMARK=1

    Provides comparison data for bi-directional conversion of an ascending
    series of number strings in all base powers. The test sequence contains
    number strings that go from a a single 32 bit register to several.
    Tested bases are: (note: b32, b128, b256 not useful and are for testing
    only)

        base 2    4    8    16   32   64   85   128   256
            bin, dna, oct, hex, b32, b64, b85, b128, b256

    Conversions are performed FROM all bases TO decimal and are repeated in
    the opposing direction FROM decimal TO all bases.

    Benchmark 1 results indicate the Math::Base::Convert typically runs
    significantly faster ( 10x to 100x) than Math::BigInt based
    implementations used in similar modules.

      make test BENCHMARK=2

    Provides comparison data for the frontend and backend converters in
    Math::Base::Convert's CalcPP and Shortcuts packages, and Math::Bigint
    conversions if it is present on the system under test.

      make test BENCHMARK=3

    Checks the relative timing of short and long number string conversions.
    FROM a base number to n*32 bit register and TO a base number from an
    n*32 bit register set.

    i.e. strings that convert to and from 1, 2, 3... etc.. 32 bit registers
