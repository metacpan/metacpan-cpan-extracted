	- build in Storage Module to support Flat File DB
	- use Storable; is used to download raw json content, STORE the preparsed hash contents that are needed for processing
	- so the first time you start the programm it downloads the json content and preparses it and stores it to flat file db
	- next time you start the programm you should see increased speed in processing because downloadin the json content an parsing
	it must not be done again, because the preparsed content is already been stored in flat file and only that we read from the second time into memory (=faster processing)
