NAME

    POE::Component::SSLify - Makes using SSL in the world of POE easy!

VERSION

      This document describes v1.012 of POE::Component::SSLify - released November 14, 2014 as part of POE-Component-SSLify.

SYNOPSIS

            # look at the DESCRIPTION for client and server example code

DESCRIPTION

    This component is a method to simplify the SSLification of a socket
    before it is passed to a POE::Wheel::ReadWrite wheel in your
    application.

 Client usage

            # Import the module
            use POE::Component::SSLify qw( Client_SSLify );
    
            # Create a normal SocketFactory wheel and connect to a SSL-enabled server
            my $factory = POE::Wheel::SocketFactory->new;
    
            # Time passes, SocketFactory gives you a socket when it connects in SuccessEvent
            # Convert the socket into a SSL socket POE can communicate with
            my $socket = shift;
            eval { $socket = Client_SSLify( $socket ) };
            if ( $@ ) {
                    # Unable to SSLify it...
            }
    
            # Now, hand it off to ReadWrite
            my $rw = POE::Wheel::ReadWrite->new(
                    Handle  =>      $socket,
                    # other options as usual
            );

 Server usage

            # !!! Make sure you have a public key + certificate
            # excellent howto: http://www.akadia.com/services/ssh_test_certificate.html
    
            # Import the module
            use POE::Component::SSLify qw( Server_SSLify SSLify_Options );
    
            # Set the key + certificate file
            eval { SSLify_Options( 'server.key', 'server.crt' ) };
            if ( $@ ) {
                    # Unable to load key or certificate file...
            }
    
            # Create a normal SocketFactory wheel to listen for connections
            my $factory = POE::Wheel::SocketFactory->new;
    
            # Time passes, SocketFactory gives you a socket when it gets a connection in SuccessEvent
            # Convert the socket into a SSL socket POE can communicate with
            my $socket = shift;
            eval { $socket = Server_SSLify( $socket ) };
            if ( $@ ) {
                    # Unable to SSLify it...
            }
    
            # Now, hand it off to ReadWrite
            my $rw = POE::Wheel::ReadWrite->new(
                    Handle  =>      $socket,
                    # other options as usual
            );

FUNCTIONS

 Client_SSLify

    This function sslifies a client-side socket. You can pass several
    options to it:

            my $socket = shift;
            $socket = Client_SSLify( $socket, $version, $options, $ctx, $callback );
                    $socket is the non-ssl socket you got from somewhere ( required )
                    $version is the SSL version you want to use
                    $options is the SSL options you want to use
                    $ctx is the custom SSL context you want to use
                    $callback is the callback hook on success/failure of sslification
    
                    # This is an example of the callback and you should pass it as Client_SSLify( $socket, ... , \&callback );
                    sub callback {
                            my( $socket, $status, $errval ) = @_;
                            # $socket is the original sslified socket in case you need to play with it
                            # $status is either 1 or 0; with 1 signifying success and 0 failure
                            # $errval will be defined if $status == 0; it's the numeric SSL error code
                            # check http://www.openssl.org/docs/ssl/SSL_get_error.html for the possible error values ( and import them from Net::SSLeay! )
    
                            # The return value from the callback is discarded
                    }

    If $ctx is defined, SSLify will ignore $version and $options.
    Otherwise, it will be created from the $version and $options
    parameters. If all of them are undefined, it will follow the defaults
    in "SSLify_ContextCreate".

    BEWARE: If you passed in a CTX, SSLify will do Net::SSLeay::CTX_free(
    $ctx ) when the socket is destroyed. This means you cannot reuse
    contexts!

    NOTE: The way to have a client socket with proper certificates set up
    is:

            my $socket = shift;     # get the socket from somewhere
            my $ctx = SSLify_ContextCreate( 'server.key', 'server.crt' );
            $socket = Client_SSLify( $socket, undef, undef, $ctx );

    NOTE: You can pass the callback anywhere in the arguments, we'll figure
    it out for you! If you want to call a POE event, please look into the
    postback/callback stuff in POE::Session.

            # we got this from POE::Wheel::SocketFactory
            sub event_SuccessEvent {
                    my $socket = $_[ARG0];
                    $socket = Client_SSLify( $socket, $_[SESSION]->callback( 'sslify_result' ) );
                    $_[HEAP]->{client} = POE::Wheel::ReadWrite->new(
                            Handle => $socket,
                            ...
                    );
                    return;
            }
    
            # the callback event
            sub event_sslify_result {
                    my ($creation_args, $called_args) = @_[ARG0, ARG1];
                    my( $socket, $status, $errval ) = @$called_args;
    
                    if ( $status ) {
                            print "Yay, SSLification worked!";
                    } else {
                            print "Aw, SSLification failed with error $errval";
                    }
            }

 Server_SSLify

    This function sslifies a server-side socket. You can pass several
    options to it:

            my $socket = shift;
            $socket = Server_SSLify( $socket, $ctx, $callback );
                    $socket is the non-ssl socket you got from somewhere ( required )
                    $ctx is the custom SSL context you want to use; overrides the global ctx set in SSLify_Options
                    $callback is the callback hook on success/failure of sslification

    BEWARE: "SSLify_Options" must be called first if you aren't passing a
    $ctx. If you want to set some options per-connection, do this:

            my $socket = shift;     # get the socket from somewhere
            my $ctx = SSLify_ContextCreate();
            # set various options on $ctx as desired
            $socket = Server_SSLify( $socket, $ctx );

    NOTE: You can use "SSLify_GetCTX" to modify the global, and avoid doing
    this on every connection if the options are the same...

    Please look at "Client_SSLify" for more details on the callback hook.

 SSLify_ContextCreate

    Accepts some options, and returns a brand-new Net::SSLeay context
    object ( $ctx )

            my $ctx = SSLify_ContextCreate( $key, $cert, $version, $options );
                    $key is the certificate key file
                    $cert is the certificate file
                    $version is the SSL version to use
                    $options is the SSL options to use

    You can then call various Net::SSLeay methods on the context

            my $mode = Net::SSLeay::CTX_get_mode( $ctx );

    By default we don't use the SSL key + certificate files

    By default we use the version: default. Known versions of the SSL
    connection - look at http://www.openssl.org/docs/ssl/SSL_CTX_new.html
    for more info.

            * sslv2
            * sslv3
            * tlsv1
            * sslv23
            * default ( sslv23 )

    By default we don't set any options - look at
    http://www.openssl.org/docs/ssl/SSL_CTX_set_options.html for more info.

 SSLify_Options

    Call this function to initialize the global server-side context object.
    This will be the default context whenever you call "Server_SSLify"
    without passing a custom context to it.

            SSLify_Options( $key, $cert, $version, $options );
                    $key is the certificate key file ( required )
                    $cert is the certificate file ( required )
                    $version is the SSL version to use
                    $options is the SSL options to use

    By default we use the version: default

    By default we use the options: Net::SSLeay::OP_ALL

    Please look at "SSLify_ContextCreate" for more info on the available
    versions/options.

 SSLify_GetCTX

    Returns the actual Net::SSLeay context object in case you wanted to
    play with it :)

    If passed in a socket, it will return that socket's $ctx instead of the
    global.

            my $ctx = SSLify_GetCTX();                      # get the one set via SSLify_Options
            my $ctx = SSLify_GetCTX( $sslified_sock );      # get the one in the object

 SSLify_GetCipher

    Returns the cipher used by the SSLified socket

            print "SSL Cipher is: " . SSLify_GetCipher( $sslified_sock ) . "\n";

    NOTE: Doing this immediately after Client_SSLify or Server_SSLify will
    result in "(NONE)" because the SSL handshake is not done yet. The
    socket is nonblocking, so you will have to wait a little bit for it to
    get ready.

            apoc@blackhole:~/mygit/perl-poe-sslify/examples$ perl serverclient.pl
            got connection from: 127.0.0.1 - commencing Server_SSLify()

            Got Reply: hola
            Input: ^C
            stopped at serverclient.pl line 126.

 SSLify_GetSocket

    Returns the actual socket used by the SSLified socket, useful for stuff
    like getpeername()/getsockname()

            print "Remote IP is: " . inet_ntoa( ( unpack_sockaddr_in( getpeername( SSLify_GetSocket( $sslified_sock ) ) ) )[1] ) . "\n";

 SSLify_GetSSL

    Returns the actual Net::SSLeay object so you can call methods on it

            print Net::SSLeay::dump_peer_certificate( SSLify_GetSSL( $sslified_sock ) );

 SSLify_GetStatus

    Returns the status of the SSL negotiation/handshake/connection. See
    http://www.openssl.org/docs/ssl/SSL_connect.html#RETURN_VALUES for more
    info.

            my $status = SSLify_GetStatus( $socket );
                    -1 = still in negotiation stage ( or error )
                     0 = internal SSL error, connection will be dead
                     1 = negotiation successful

NOTES

 Socket methods doesn't work

    The new socket this module gives you actually is tied socket magic, so
    you cannot do stuff like getpeername() or getsockname(). The only way
    to do it is to use "SSLify_GetSocket" and then operate on the socket it
    returns.

 Dying everywhere...

    This module will die() if Net::SSLeay could not be loaded or it is not
    the version we want. So, it is recommended that you check for errors
    and not use SSL, like so:

            eval { use POE::Component::SSLify };
            if ( $@ ) {
                    $sslavailable = 0;
            } else {
                    $sslavailable = 1;
            }
    
            # Make socket SSL!
            if ( $sslavailable ) {
                    eval { $socket = POE::Component::SSLify::Client_SSLify( $socket ) };
                    if ( $@ ) {
                            # Unable to SSLify the socket...
                    }
            }

  $IGNORE_SSL_ERRORS

    As of SSLify v1.003 you can override this variable to temporarily
    ignore some SSL errors. This is useful if you are doing crazy things
    with the underlying Net::SSLeay stuff and don't want to die. However,
    it won't ignore all errors as some is still considered fatal. Here's an
    example:

            {
                    local $POE::Component::SSLify::IGNORE_SSL_ERRORS=1;
                    my $ctx = SSLify_CreateContext(...);
                    #Some more stuff
            }

 OpenSSL functions

    Theoretically you can do anything that Net::SSLeay exports from the
    OpenSSL libs on the socket. However, I have not tested every possible
    function against SSLify, so use them carefully!

  Net::SSLeay::renegotiate

    This function has been tested ( it's in t/2_renegotiate_client.t ) but
    it doesn't work on FreeBSD! I tracked it down to this security
    advisory:
    http://security.freebsd.org/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-09:15.ssl.asc which
    explains it in detail. The test will skip this function if it detects
    that you're on a broken system. However, if you have the updated
    OpenSSL library that fixes this you can use it.

    NOTE: Calling this means the callback function you passed in
    "Client_SSLify" or "Server_SSLify" will not fire! If you need this
    please let me know and we can come up with a way to make it work.

 Upgrading a non-ssl socket to SSL

    You can have a normal plaintext socket, and convert it to SSL anytime.
    Just keep in mind that the client and the server must agree to sslify
    at the same time, or they will be waiting on each other forever! See
    t/3_upgrade.t for an example of how this works.

 Downgrading a SSL socket to non-ssl

    As of now this is unsupported. If you need this feature please let us
    know and we'll work on it together!

 MSWin32 is not supported

    This module doesn't work on MSWin32 platforms at all ( XP, Vista, 7,
    etc ) because of some weird underlying fd issues. Since I'm not a
    windows developer, I'm unable to fix this. However, it seems like
    Cygwin on MSWin32 works just fine! Please help me fix this if you can,
    thanks!

 LOAD_SSL_ENGINES

    OpenSSL supports loading ENGINEs to accelerate the crypto algorithms.
    SSLify v1.004 automatically loaded the engines, but there was some
    problems on certain platforms that caused coredumps. A big shout-out to
    BinGOs and CPANTesters for catching this! It's now disabled in v1.007
    and you would need to explicitly enable it.

            sub POE::Component::SSLify::LOAD_SSL_ENGINES () { 1 }
            use POE::Component::SSLify qw( Client::SSLify );

EXPORT

    Stuffs all of the functions in @EXPORT_OK so you have to request them
    directly.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

            Original code is entirely Rocco Caputo ( Creator of POE ) -> I simply
            packaged up the code into something everyone could use and accepted the burden
            of maintaining it :)
    
            From the PoCo::Client::HTTP code =]
            # This code should probably become a POE::Kernel method,
            # seeing as it's rather baroque and potentially useful in a number
            # of places.

    ASCENT also helped a lot with the nonblocking mode, without his hard
    work this module would still be stuck in the stone age :)

    A lot of people helped add various features/functions - please look at
    the changelog for more detail.
