Role-RunAlone

This Role provides a simple way for a command line script to ensure that
only a single instance of said script is able to run at one time. This is
accomplished by trying to obtain an exlusive lock on the sctript's __DATA__
or __END__ section.

The Role will call C<exit(2)> if neither of those tags are present.
This behavior can not be disabled and occurs when the Role is composed.

If one of the aforementioned tags are present, a failure to obtain an
exclusive lock indicates that another instance of the composing script
is already executing and the Role will call C<exit(1)>. This behavior
can be modified if desired by means of an environment variable.

Please see the main documentation for a full description.
