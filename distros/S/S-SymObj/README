SymObj.pm provides an easy way to create and construct symbol-tables
and objects.  With a simple hash one defines the fields an object
should have.  An automatically instantiated constructor can then be
used to create the object, and the generated accessor subs implement
a *feed in and forget* approach when they are about to manage arrays
or hashes, trying to handle all kinds of arguments; this is also true
for the constructor.

If debug was enabled upon creation time a constructor which does a lot
of argument checking and more is used, which is pretty useful in times
when the interface is unstable.  Otherwise a different constructor is
used which implements no checking at all; and if the object in question
is the head of a "clean" object tree, one that is entirely managed by
S-SymObj, then indeed a super-fast super-lean constructor implementation
is used that'll rock your house.

The SymObj module is available on CPAN.  The S-SymObj project is located
at https://www.sdaoden.eu/code.html.  It is developed using a git(1)
repository, which is located at https://git.sdaoden.eu/scm/s-symobj.git
(browse it at https://git.sdaoden.eu/git/s-symobj.git).

Installation
------------

Since v0.6.0 [S-]SymObj is available on CPAN as SymObj.  Please see
the standard ``$ man 1 cpan`` (and maybe ``$ man 1 perlmodinstall``)
manual(s) for how to perform a regular installation from CPAN.
In short: ``$ cpan SymObj``.

But In general SymObj.pm is a Perl module and therefore needs to be
in ``@INC`` if scripts should be able to find it easily.  This can be
accomplished by placing the SymObj.pm somewhere and either specifying
the path via the ``-I`` command line option, or, and that is maybe the
easiest and most flexible solution, by placing it in the ``PERL5LIB``
environment variable.  Here is how to do that in a Bourne/Korn/POSIX
shell: ::

   $ PERL5LIB=/PATH/TO/SymObj.pm PERL5OPT=-C
   $ export PERL5LIB PERL5OPT

Usage
-----

The complete and up-to-date documentation is part of the S-SymObj
module itself -- if that has been regularly installed via CPAN as shown
above, then the manual should show up by typing ``$ man SymObj``,
otherwise the ``pod2XY`` family of programs can be used directly upon
SymObj.pm, as in ``$ pod2text SymObj.pm``.  The POD example as of
2016-10-24: ::

   use diagnostics -verbose;
   use strict;
   use warnings;
   # You need to require it in a BEGIN{}..; $Debug may be one of 0/1/2
   BEGIN{ require SymObj; $SymObj::Debug = 2 }

   # Accessor subs return references for hashes and arrays (but shallow
   # clones in wantarray context), scalars are returned "as-is"
   {package X1;
      SymObj::sym_create(SymObj::NONE, { # (NONE is 0..)
         _name => '', _array => [qw(Is Easy)],
         _hash => {To => 'hv1', Use => 'hv2'},
         boing => undef}) # <- $SymObj::Debug will complain!  FAILS!
   }

   {package X2;
      our @ISA = ('X1');
      SymObj::sym_create(0, {}) # <- adds no fields on its own
   }
   # (Clean hierarchy has optimized constructor which is used, then)
   if($SymObj::Debug != 0){
      $o = X2->new(name => 'It detects some misuses (if $Debug > 0)',
         'un' => 'known argument catched')
   }else{
      $o = X2->new(name => 'It detects some misuses (if $Debug > 0)')
   }

      our @ISA = ('X2');
      SymObj::sym_create(0, {'_name' => 'Auto superclass-ovw'},
         sub{ my $self = shift; print "X3 usr ctor\n" })
   }
   $o = X3->new();
   print $o->name, "\n";

   # One may enforce creation of array/hash accessors even for undef
   # values by using the @/% type modifiers; the objects themselves
   # are lazy-created as necessary, then...
   {package X4;
      our @ISA = ('X3');
      SymObj::sym_create(0, {'%_hash2'=>undef, '@_array2'=>undef});
      sub __ctor{ my $self = shift; print "X4 usr ctor\n" }
   }
   $o = X4->new(name => 'A X4');
   die 'Lazy-allocation failed'
      if !defined $o->hash2 || !defined $o->array2;
   print join(' ', keys %{$o->hash2(Allocation=>1, Lazy=>1)}), ' ';
   print join(' ', @{$o->array2(qw(Can Be Used))}), "\n";

   %{$o->hash2} = ();
   $o->hash2(HashAndArray => 'easy');
   $o->hash2(qw(Accessors development));
   $o->hash2('Really', 'is');
   $o->hash2(['Swallow', 'possible']);
   $o->hash2({ Anything => 'here' });
   print join(' ', keys %{$o->hash2}), "\n"
   # P.S.: this is also true for the constructor(s)
