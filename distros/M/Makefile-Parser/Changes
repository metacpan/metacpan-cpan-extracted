* added some more POD to plmake

0.13 2007-03-10
* minor POD fixes: C<< ... >> and SVN repos URL

0.12 2007-03-10
* added the C<prereqs> method to Makefile::Parser
* added POD accordingly (deprecated C<depends>)
* explaned the current status and plans for this module in the POD
* checked in a naive "make" command-line utility "plmake" which uses Makefile::Parser
* added basic support for commands after ';' in rules
* added a second optional argument to the C<parse> method so as to pass initial variable settings to the parser
* updated plmake to pass %ENV and variables specified on the command-line to the parser
* forced to use "/bin/sh" in run_commands
* implemented GNU make function 'subst', 'patsubst', 'strip', 'findstring', 'filter', 'filter-out' and 'sort'.
* implemented the Substitution References in GNU makefiles, for example, $(objects:.o=.c)
* fixed a bug regarding single-letter variable expansion

0.11 10/17/2005
* User-defined variable names are defined as /\w+/
* GNUMake's variable expansion sytax
        ${FOO}
  is now supported. Guretz++
* Add support for variable definition sytax
        FOO := blah blah blah
* Expand $@ in commands as expected
* Optimize the parser effectively by following Guretz Maxim's
  enlightening suggestion. Guretz++

0.10 10/16/2005
* Update the version number to 0.10
* Fix the platform-specific tests, stripped CR from test files,
  and test both against Cygwin and Win32. Slaven++

0.09 10/15/2005
* Fix a stupid bug in Parser.pm. The order of the two suffixes is
  inverted accidentally.
* Update the POD document, implementation, and tests accordingly.

0.08 10/10/2005
* Make Makefile::Parser->parse to raise syntax errors under strict mode
* Add full support for implicit pattern rules:
    %.o : %.c
        $(CC) -c $<
  The order of the implicit rules is not significant. Whee!
* Add more tests for pattern rules, expand $< and $* as expected, and clean up
  the stderr output.
* Add support for implicit suffix rules:
    .c.o:
        $(CC) -c $<
  Currently .SUFFIXES is a no-op. So suffix rules will be applied to any 
  suffix-like targets.
  Internally the parser converts the suffix rules to pattern
  rules, thus saving me a lot of coding.

0.07 10/5/2005
* Host this module to a SVN repository at OSSF
* Add sections "Syntax Supported" and "TODO" to POD doc

0.06 10/5/2005
* Add string-ify overloading to the Makefile::Target class
* Use tar+gzip to compress the distribution.

0.05 10/1/2005
* Add support for the syntax ^\

0.04 9/30/2005
* Fix some issues in the POD doc

0.03 9/30/2005
* Force the user to call the ->parse method after he/she constructs every Makefile::Parser object.
  That is to say, the constructor of the Makefile::Parser class won't call ->parse internally
  from now on.
* Add error checking code and corresponding tests for Parser objects which has never parsed anything.
* Add support of default target to the ->target method of the Makefile::Parser class.
* Add method ->roots to the Makefile::Parser class which returns the "root targets" for the
  Makefile.
* Use Devel::Cover to check the code coverage.
* Use Test::Pod to check the validity of the POD docs
* Use Test::Pod::Coverage to check the integrity of POD docs

0.02 9/25/2005
