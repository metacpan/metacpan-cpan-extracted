      will be done in the _report() function
    - the event text now begins with the script's absolute path

1.00  10 Jan 2001
        - This version is a serious re-write!
    - Win32 events are posted by trapping __WARN__ and __DIE__ signals
      (which means warnings and errors from most other modules used by
      the calling program will be posted to the event log)

    * changed behavior of 'click' to use Carp::shortmess
    - carriage-return/newline combinations handled better in event text
    - blank lines in event text are ignored
