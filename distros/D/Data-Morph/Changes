1.112770  2011-10-04 10:30:35 Europe/Amsterdam
        Bug/Doc fix regarding the map constraint. It should have been:
            union([Str, Tuple[Maybe[Str], CodeRef]])

1.112760  2011-10-03 19:06:52 Europe/Amsterdam
        Relax the constraint on the store method defined in Role::Backend from
        Defined to Any

        Allow for one-way transformations by not providing a write within the
        map for that particular element

        Read elements can now use a tuple of undef+coderef as a special case
        for supplying OOB data

1.112730  2011-09-30 14:19:35 Europe/Amsterdam
        Tweak generate_instance to receive the raw input to allow for dynamic
        building of instances.

        Move the default value for new_instance in Backend::DBIC out to a
        builder method

        Update deps to include SQL::Translator so we can test with DBD::SQLite
