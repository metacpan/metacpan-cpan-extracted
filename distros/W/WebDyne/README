Introduction
============

WebDyne is a dynamic content generation engine for Apache/mod_perl and PSGI web servers (such as
Plack and Starman). HTML documents with embedded Perl code are processed to produce dynamic HTML
output.

An installer is included in the base WebDyne module for Apache, or a PSGI variant is included
for use with Plack. Once WebDyne is installed any file with a .psp extension is treated as a
WebDyne source file. It is parsed for WebDyne tags (such as <perl> and <block>) which are
interpreted and executed on the server as appropriate to generate a compliant HTML document. The
resulting output is then sent to the browser.

Once parsed paged are are optionally stored in a partially compiled format, speeding up
subsequent processing. The aim of WebDyne is to make coding web pages with Perl components a
faster, easier and more enjoyable experience.

Getting Started
===============

Install the WebDyne module from CPAN using cpanminus (cpanm) or cpan, and install Plack for the
PSGI version.

    #  Use cpan if you don't have cpanm
    #
    $ cpanm WebDyne
    Building and testing Webdyne-2.04 ... OK

    $ cpanm Plack
    Building and testing Plack-1.0051 ... OK

Run the PSGI variant in test mode and connect to the server to check that it is working.

    $ webdyne.psgi --test
    HTTP::Server::PSGI: Accepting connections at http://0:5000/

Create an app.psp file in the appropriate web server home directory. Don't be put off by the
shortcut <start_html> tag, you can still use traditional tags if you like.

    # Create file called app.psp with this content.
    #
    <start_html>
    The local server time is: <perl>localtime()</perl>

Run the PSGI variant against that directory

    # 
    $ webdyne.psgi /location/of/app.psp
    HTTP::Server::PSGI: Accepting connections at http://0:5000/
