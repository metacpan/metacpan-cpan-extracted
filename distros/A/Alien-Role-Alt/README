NAME

    Alien::Role::Alt - Alien::Base role that supports alternates

VERSION

    version 0.04

SYNOPSIS

    From your alienfile

     use alienfile;
     
     plugin 'PkgConfig' => (
       pkg_name => [ 'libfoo', 'libbar', ],
     );

    Then in your base class:

     package Alien::Libfoo;
     
     use base qw( Alien::Base );
     use Role::Tiny::With qw( with );
     
     with 'Alien::Role::Alt';
     
     1;

    Then you can use it:

     use Alien::Libfoo;
     
     my $cflags = Alien::Libfoo->alt('foo1')->cflags;
     my $libs   = Alien::Libfoo->alt('foo1')->libs;

DESCRIPTION

    NOTE: The capabilities that used to be provided by this role have been
    moved into Alien::Base's core class. This is an empty role provided for
    compatibility only. New code should not be using this class.

    Some packages come with multiple libraries, and multiple .pc files to
    use with them. This Role::Tiny role can be used with Alien::Base to
    access different configurations.

METHODS

 alt

     my $new_alien = $old_alien->alt($alt_name);

    Returns an Alien::Base instance with the alternate configuration.
