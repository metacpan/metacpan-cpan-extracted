DbFramework change log

2008-05-03	version 1.12
	 1. Makefile.PL and Build.PL: Provide a valid default DSN for
	    DBD::mysql, DBD::mSQL and DBD::Pg.
	 2. Makefile.PL and Build.PL: Do not create the schema if
	    answer is "no".

2008-04-21
	 1. Changes: Updated.
	 2. Build.PL: Renamed test database from "dbframework_test" to
	    "test", to adapt the convention of MySQL and PostgreSQL.
	 3. TODO: Added.
	 4. AUTHORS: Added.
	 5. Artistic and COPYING: Added.
	 6. Makefile.PL: Added PL_FILES to disable PL files searching
	    behavior, in order to work with ExtUtils::MakeMaker earlier
	    than 6.25 that treats Build.PL as one of the PL files to run.

2008-04-20
	 1. Added lib and lib/DbFramework subdirectory.  Move everything
	    inside, to make the directory cleaner.
	 2. Makefile.PL: Clean up.  Removed PMLIBDIRS since it is not
	    required anymore.  Removed linkext.  linkext is only needed
	    for ExtUtils::MakeMaker before version 5.  That is too old
	    today.
	 3. Makefile.PL and Build.PL: Use "use lib qw(lib);
	    use DbFramework::Util;" instead of "require "./Util.pm"", in
	    order to be more portable on different platforms.
	 4. Makefile.PL: Renamed test database from "dbframework_test" to
	    "test", to adapt the convention of MySQL and PostgreSQL.
	 5. README: Moved Paul's BackPen URL to the previous line.

2008-04-19
	 1. Added lib and lib/DbFramework subdirectory.  Move everything
	    inside, to make the directory cleaner.
	 2. Changes: Added, with contents from original Paul's README file.
	    This is to adapt the Perl module convention.

2008-04-19	version 1.11
	Maintainance taken over by imacat.
	 1. Makefile.PL: Updated to use prompt() from ExtUtils::MakeMaker
	    instead of reading STDIN directly, in order to prevent infinite
	    loop with automated CPAN testers.  (RT#34538)
	 2. t/util.pl: Subroutine yn() removed.  It is not used anymore,
	    due to the prompt() fix.
	 3. README: Add notice about the distribution ownership change.
	 4. Makefile.PL: ABSTRACT, AUTHOR, LICENSE and SIGN added to the
	    WriteMakefile() arguments.  VERSION is added in replace of
	    VERSION_FROM.
	 5. SIGNATURE: Digital signature added.
	 6. META.yml: YAML distribution meta-nformation added.
	 7. Build.PL: Module::Build build support added.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
RELEASE 1.10

Added support for PostgreSQL.

INTERFACE CHANGES
  PrimaryKey::
    - New method as_hidden_html()

30-04-1999               Paul Sharpe          <paul@miraclefish.com>
--------------------------------------------------------------------
RELEASE 1.09

dbforms.cgi
  - Can now update primary keys.
  - Removed dependency on ePerl.
  - Now takes dsn arguments to cater for variance between DBDs.

INTERFACE CHANGES
  Catalog::
    - set_primary_key() now sets labels if defined in the catalog.
  DataModel::
    - New method dsn().
    - new() now requires name to be the database name as pattern match
      to get database name forgot that this part of a DBI DSN is *non
      standard*
    - init_db_metadata() now requires DSN for catalog as it varies
      between drivers.  Also now allows username/password for authentication
      against catalog database.
  ForeignKey::
    - New method sql_where().
  Makefile.PL
    - Moved most of the catalog initialisation here.
    - Manual creation of databases now required as there's no standard
      for creating databases.  Each driver can use an arbitrarily named
      database for testing.
  Persistent::
    - new() now requires a Catalog object.
    - update now takes %attributes argument so that a primary key can be
      updated.  The current object state is used to update the row WHERE the
      primary key matches the values in %attributes.
  PrimaryKey::
    - html_select_field() now has 'Any' *and* 'NULL' entries.  I have a
      feeling this still isn't quite right.
    - New method as_hidden_html()
    - Signature to new() has changed now that label columns are
      supported by the catalog.
    - html_select_field() now follows label columns which are foreign
      keys back to their associated primary key table and uses the label
      columns from that table.  This gives more meaningful select fields.
  Table::
    - init_db_metadata() now requires catalog object argument.  This
      should improve performance as a new catalog object (which involves a
      database connect()) won't be created every time this method is called.
    - in_foreign_key() now returns a list of foreign keys containing
      $attribute
  DataType::ANSII::
    - Signature to new() has changed.  Now requires $ansii_type
      argument.  All data type objects will need to return their closest
      ANSII types as this is the $type which needs to be supplied to
      $dbh->quote($value,$type).
    - New method ansii_type().

RELEASE 1.08

BUG FIX

    fail.

RELEASE 1.01 (FIRST PUBLIC RELEASE)


To do
=====

* BUG: dbforms.cgi delete on row consisting of all foreign keys silently fails.

* Improve dbforms.cgi interface.  Perhaps a rename is in order too.
I'm thinking of having a single record interface with record
navigation.  The form can then be designed and specified as an
argument.

* Fri Jan 8, 1999
  BUG - >1 fk relating to the same pk table in a single table is not
       handled by dbforms.cgi
  
4/1/1999
  - User-defined templates specify attributes to be used for foreign keys
    and ordering
  - Allow relationships between the same table (in different roles).
    Needs documenting

* Make Bundle::DbFramework

* Schema grammar
  - might be better off using Jeeves (from the Panther book)
  - should handle relationships of degree >2
  - could be CDIF compliant

* Attributes of relationships should be stored so that full schema
  including attributes of relationships can be built from meta-data.

* add support for UNIQUE columns (different to ordinary KEYs)

* make primary key in grammar optional (1:1 relationships) 

* make relationships optional in grammar
