A programming project required the creation of a Revision Control
System (RCS) front end.  I started with inline system calls to the RCS
utilities, and by creating multiple parsing functions to extract information
from an RCS archive file.

I then decided to put all my functions in one place, and created Perl module
Rcs.pm.

The next step was to change my functions into object methods, and Rcs.pm
became object oriented.  

This Perl module should be of interest to anyone creating an RCS front end.

Here's a quick and dirty example of how to check in a file.

use Rcs;

$obj = Rcs->new;
$obj->file('testfile.pl');

# Set RCS archive directory, is './RCS' by default
$obj->rcsdir("./project_tree/archive");

# Set working directory, is '.' by default
$obj->workdir("./project_tree/src");

$obj->ci('-mRevision Comment');

If there's any interest, I would like to make Rcs.pm publicly available.
Please let me know is you have any suggestions or comments.
