=head1 REST API

This document defines the REST API.  By and large, this follows the WebIOpi 
REST interface:

  https://code.google.com/p/webiopi/wiki/INSTALL?tm=6

There are a few notable differences, mostly to account for being on more 
than just the Rapsberry Pi.  For instance, the pcDuino has different 
voltage and bit resolutions for some of its ADC and PWM channels, so 
the API to access that data must specify a pin.

Specific differences are noted as "B<COMPATIBILITY NOTE>" below.

=head2 Status Codes

Just a few of the HTTP status codes you might expect to hit.

400 Bad Request (path incomplete)
403 GPIO # Not Available
403 GPIO # Disabled
404 [something] Not Found 


=head2 BASIC

=head3 GET /map

Returns a JSON list, with each entry corresponding to a pin on the physical 
header.  Each entry can be:

=over 4

=item * Some number (corresponding to a GPIO number)

=item * "V33" (3.3 volt power)

=item * "V50" (5.0 volt power)

=item * "GND" (ground)

=back

Example:

    ["V33", "V50", 2, "V50", 3, "GND", 4, 14, "GND", 15, 17, 18, 27, "GND", 22, 23, "V33", 24, 10, "GND", 9, 25, 11, 8, "GND", 7]

=head3 GET /*

Returns a JSON of available interfaces.  Keys:

=over 4

=item * UART [bool]

=item * SPI [bool]

=item * I2C [bool]

=item * ONEWIRE [bool]

=item * GPIO [object]

=back

GPIO's keys are numbers mapping to each GPIO pin.  The values are objects 
containing:

=over 4

=item * function ["IN", "OUT", "ALTn" (where n is some number)]

=item * value [bool]

=back

Example: 

    {
        "UART": 1, 
        "SPI": 0, 
        "I2C": 0, 
        "ONEWIRE": 0,
