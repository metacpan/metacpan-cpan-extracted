	  <bsdz@numeninest.com>

	! Updated Makefile.PL in order to:
		- accept command line switch '-n' which 
		  doesn't ask at prompt and doesn't run live Apache tests. This is to pack
		  easier this package for Debian (suggested by Krzysztof Krzyzaniak 
		  <eloy@debian.org>)
		- check correctly environment: test mod_perl generation
		  and test suite. Added messages before configuring test
		- add httpd.conf extra lines for testing with Apache::DBI
	! Updated PODS
		- SessionManager.pm PODS (VERSION section)
		- added L<> in every module name
		- documented mp1/mp2 bug with "PerlSetVar Foo 0"
		- Switched use of $ENV{'GATEWAY_INTERFACE'} to $ENV{'MOD_PERL'} in
	     cookbook samples
		- Fix 'Expire' with 'Expires'
	! Bug fix: SessionManagerExpire: '0' => (none|no|disabled) value means no 
	  expiration time 
	! Moved tests to run only under Apache::testold mod_perl 1 test suite
	! Ported t/lib/*.pm sample modules to work either with mod_perl 1.0 and 2.0

0.06    Mon Jul 28 17:00:00 2003
