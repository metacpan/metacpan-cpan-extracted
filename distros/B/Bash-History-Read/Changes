Revision history for Bash-History-Read

0.04    2015-11-07 (PERLANCAR)

	- Allow stripping timestamp by undef-ing $TS.

	- Increase minimum perl version from 5.10.1 -> 5.14 because we use
	  package BLOCK syntax [CT].


0.03    2015-11-05 (PERLANCAR)

        - Change parsing algorithm to be more flexible and more closely follows
          bash. Since bash history file can contain a mix of entries that have
          timestamps and entries that do not, we just need to assume that all
          /^\#\d+$/ lines are timestamps, instead of requiring that all entries
          are prefixed with a timestamp.

        - Add parse_bash_history_file().


0.02    2015-11-04 (PERLANCAR)

	- [Bugfix] Don't add timestamp for each line in a multiple-line
	  entry.


0.01    2015-10-12 (PERLANCAR)

        - First release.
