0.09 Sun Jan 28 11:29:28 CET 2007
        [ENHANCEMENTS]
        - added support for aliases: perl is an alias perl_tidy,
          and ppi is an alias for perl_ppi
        - added support for wiki format thanks to chromatic's Text::WikiFormat
        - added support for mediawiki format thanks to Derek Price's
          Text::MediawikiFormat
        [CHANGED BEHAVIOUR]
        - non verbatim filters do not add <p></p> tags any more

0.08 Thu Jan 25 23:53:59 CET 2007
        [ENHANCEMENTS]
        - Sébastien Aperghis-Tramoni added support for a new Perl
          highlighter: PPI::HTML
        [EXAMPLES]
        - example stylesheets included for the following filters:
          perl, html, kate and ppi

0.07 Tue Jan 16 23:27:48 CET 2007
        [ENHANCEMENTS]
        - support for kate filtering, thanks to Hans Jeuken's
          Syntax::Highlight::Engine::Kate
        [TESTS]
        - added the t/14indent.t test file, forgotten in the previous
          release

0.06 Tue Jan 16 01:59:05 CET 2007
        [ENHANCEMENTS]
        - add() behaves differently when called on the class or an
          instance, and updates the appropriate list of filters:
          + an instance always has access to the latest class filters (so
            you can update the class with add() after creating an object
            and it will DWYM)
          + it's possible to override the class filter for a single
            instance
        - blocks are now automatically unindented before processing,
          but it's possible to prevent this (at your own risks) with
          auto_unindent => 0 in the constructor
        - HTML characters '&', '<' and '>' are now escaped in the default
          filter
        - the result is enclosed in <pre>...</pre> if any of the filters
          if declared as 'verbatim', and also if Pod::POM detected a
          verbatim block inside the begin block (which it shouldn't do,
          since begin block should be opaque to it... but that's a bug
          in Pod::POM). Otherwise it's enclosed in <p>...</p> tags.
        - when processing a filter stack, if one of the filters is not
          available, the whole stack is replaced with the 'default'
          filter
        [DOCUMENTATION]
        - the Caveats listed in the documentation are no longer valid,
          since the content of the begin block is now processed as
          a string where the POD escape sequences are left alone
        [FIXES]
        - the bug discovered in version 0.03 has been unexpectedly
          removed, when reworking the processing of the filter stack
        [TESTS]
        - the main test script (t/20builtins.t) uses the files in t/pod/
          as test data. Those files contain a pod source, and the expected
          results according to a combination of available filters.
        - the tests related to the "disappearing POM" bug are no longer
          marked TODO

0.05 Thu Oct 14 11:44:14 CEST 2004
        [FEATURES]
        - support stacking filters by using the | notation
        [ENHANCEMENTS]
        - =for blocks now accept filter options
        - much better processing for the content of the begin section
        - support for shell colouring with Maddingue's Syntax::Highlight::Shell
        [DOCUMENTATION]
        - much more documentation with many examples
        [FIXES]
        - removed the pasted code from Pod::POM::View::HTML (see 0.03)

0.04 Tue Tue Oct 12 09:46:17 CEST 2004
        [ENHANCEMENTS]
        - when the filter is not known by PPVHF, simply use the default
          filter (<pre>...</pre>)
        - $Pod::POM::View::HTML::Filter::default is the default filter
        [FIXES]
        - set Getopt::Long::Configure back to defaults just before calling
          perltidy, which may break otherwise
        - consistently use carp and croak

0.03 Thu Jul 29 01:05:02 CEST 2004
        [ENHANCEMENTS]
        - more flexible interface for the add() method, that lets one
          add more parameters to a filter (requires, verbatim)
        - the verbatim mode for filters prevent the present()
          method to be called on the verbatim, text and code items it
          contains. The content of all items is catenated and passed to
          the filter as a single block.
        - support for html filtering, thanks to Maddingue's
          Syntax::Highlight::HTML.
        [BUGS]
        - for some unknown reason, presenting the pod twice is broken
          with the perl filter (TODO test added).
        - view_seq_text is copied verbatim from Pod::POM::View::HTML,
          because I need to access a private variable. This should be
          fixed, because duplicated code is never good.
        [FIXES]
        - Makefile.PL lists the prerequisites forgotten in 0.02

0.02 Mon Jul 26 15:00:28 CEST 2004
        [ENHANCEMENTS]
        - limited support for =begin filter options
        - perl_filter can now accept options (such as -nnn)

0.01 Mon Jul 26 12:11:00 CEST 2004
        [FEATURES]
        - add(), know(), filters()
        - =begin filter foo
        - =for filter=foo
        Did I mention it's the first version?
