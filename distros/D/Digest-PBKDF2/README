NAME
    Digest::PBKDF2 A minimalist Digest module using the PBKDF2 algorithm.

NOTICE
    You can only use one salt, a pre-salt, with this module. It is not smart
    enough to do post-salts.

SYNOPSIS
        my $digest = Digest::PBKDF2->new;   # Or...
        my $digest = Digest::PBKDF2->new(encoding => 'ldap');
        $digest->add('mysalt');             # salt = 'mysalt'
        $digest->add('k3wLP@$$w0rd');       # password = 'k3wLP@$$w0rd'

        $digest->add('eX+ens10n');          # password = 'k3wLP@$$w0rdeX+ens10n'

        my $result = $digest->digest;       # $PBKDF2$HMACSHA1:1000:bXlzYWx0$4P9pwp
                                            # LoF+eq5jwUbMw05qRQyZs=

    That's about it.

METHODS
    new Create a new Digest::PBKDF2 object. This defaults to using the
        "ldap" encoding available in Crypt::PBKDF2--please see Crypt::PBKDF2
        for details.

    clone
        Copies the data and state from the original Digest::PBKDF2 object,
        and returns a new object.

    add Pass this method your salt and data chunks. They are stored up until
        you call digest.

    digest
        This encrypts your data and returns the encrypted string.

    reset
        After calling digest, the module calls reset on its self, clearing
        data and the record of how many additions were made to the data to
        be digested.
