NAME

    report-prereqs - report prerequisite versions

VERSION

    Version 0.001

SYNOPSIS

    report-prereqs [--with-develop]

DESCRIPTION

    The report-prereqs utility will examine cpanfile for prerequisites with
    Module::CPANfile. It reports the version of all modules listed as
    prerequisites (including 'recommends', 'suggests', etc.). However, any
    'develop' prerequisites are not reported, unless they show up in
    another category or the --with-develop option is used.

    Versions are reported based on the result of parse_version from
    ExtUtils::MakeMaker, which means prerequisite modules are not actually
    loaded. Parse errors are reported as "undef". If a module is not
    installed, "missing" is reported instead of a version string.

    Additionally, unfulfilled required prerequisites are reported after the
    list of all versions.

OPTIONS

    --with-develop

      Also report develop prerequisites.

EXIT STATUS

    The report-prereqs utility exits 0 on success, 1 if an error occurs,
    and 2 if invalid command line options were specified.

    The state of the prerequisites does have no effect on the exist status.
