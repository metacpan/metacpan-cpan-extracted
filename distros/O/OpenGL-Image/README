This module provides methods to load/modify/save images for use
with OpenGL textures, FBOs and VBOs.

It requires the OpenGL module - version 0.55_03 or newer.

It also requires at least one supported OpenGL::Image imaging engine.
At this time, the following drivers are supported:

* Targa  - Pure Perl - uncompressed RGBA files (comes with OpenGL::Image).
* Magick - Requires PerlMagick (v6.3.5 or newer for best performance).

You can find the latest releases and information for installing/using
these modules at the Perl OpenGL (POGL) Developer's Site:
http://graphcomp.com/opengl


NOTE: as of 1.03, you _must_ call Sync prior to calling native (eg. ImageMagick) APIs
on an OpenGL::Image object, and call SyncOGA when done with your native calls.
