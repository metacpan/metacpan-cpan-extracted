Revision history for Tapper-Schema

5.0.9     2017-02-14
        - support for testrun_scheduling content update

5.0.8     2016-08-24
        - last release did only search by updated_at but not show it
          with that -- now fixed

5.0.7     2016-08-24
        - rawsql testrun web_list now based on updated_at field
        - fix transaction handling on testrun+host state setting
          (fixing a mis-scheduling in Tapper::MCP)

5.0.6     2016-03-11
        - provide a MySQL optimized plain SQL "create tables" file
          supporting UTF-8 and COMPRESSED tables
          (see https://github.com/tapper/Tapper/wiki/SwitchingToMySQL)
        - that file also does not contain the unused Tapper::Benchmark
          tables, as we use BenchmarkAnything anyway
          (however, the Tapper::Schema::TestrunDB still contains them
          to not diverge from upstream too much)

5.0.5     2016-03-10
