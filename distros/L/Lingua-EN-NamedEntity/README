NAME
    Lingua::EN::NamedEntity - Basic Named Entity Extraction algorithm

SYNOPSIS
      use Lingua::EN::NamedEntity;
      my @entities = extract_entities($some_text);

DESCRIPTION
    "Named entities" is the NLP jargon for proper nouns which represent
    people, places, organizations, and so on. This module provides a very
    simple way of extracting these from a text. If we run the
    "extract_entities" routine on a piece of news coverage of recent UK
    political events, we should expect to see it return a list of hash
    references looking like this:

      { entity => 'Mr Howard', class => 'person', scores => { ... }, },
      { entity => 'Ministry of Defence', class => 'organisation', ... },
      { entity => 'Oxfordshire', class => 'place', ... },

    The additional "scores" hash reference in there breaks down the various
    possible classes for this entity in an open-ended scale.

    Naturally, the more text you throw at this, the more accurate it
    becomes.
