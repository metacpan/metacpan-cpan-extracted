NAME
    git-find - Find files anywhere in a Git repository

SYNOPSIS
        git find [SWITCHES] [REVS] [--] [EXPRESSION]

    This command searches for files satisfying the "EXPRESSION", a la find(1),
    anywhere in a Git repo.  Unlike find(1), the search scope is the whole
    repo (for the "REVS" you specify) regardless of the current directory.

    For more help, run "git find --help" or "git find --man".

    NOTE: most of this is not yet implemented :) .  Contributions welcome!

OPTIONS AND ARGUMENTS
    Quick reference:

    Switches:
        Help (-?, --usage; -h, --help; --man); Version (-V, --version);
        Verbosity (-v); Warnings (-W).

    Revs:
        Anything accepted by git-rev-parse(1).

        A git ref (under ".git/refs/") is also a rev in the sense of
        git-rev-parse(1) and gitrevisions(7).  The terms "ref" and "rev" are
        used interchangeably by "git-find".

    Expression:
        Anything accepted by find(1), plus -ref/-rev

DESCRIPTION
  Switches
    These are options controlling the overall behaviour of git-find.  They may
    not be interleaved in with the "Expression", if one is given.

    -?, --usage
        Print a brief usage reminder

    -h, --help
        Print basic help

    --man
        Show full help (equivalent to "man git-find")

    -u  Unrestricted search.  Normally, git-find does not search ignored
        files.  When this option is given, it does search those files. 
        However, it still skips ".git/" directories.

    -v  Increase verbosity.  May be given multiple times.

    -V, --version
        Print version information and exit

    -W, -Wname
        Enable warning name, or all warnings if no name is given.

  Operators
    In the "Revs" or "Expression", you can specify multiple items joined by
    logical operators.  They are listed below in order of descending
    precedence.  Each operator must be separated by whitespace from any
    adjacent parameters.  Operators short-circuit.

    ( ), [ ]
        Grouping.  Parentheses and brackets are interchangeable.

    -not, --not, !, ^
        Logical negation.

    -a, --a, -and, --and, &&
        Logical and.  This is the default operator between terms if no
        operator is given.

    -o, --o, -or, --or, ||
        Logical or

    , (a single comma)
        Sequence: separates items to be evaluated separately.  The return
        value is that of the last item in the sequence.

  Revs
    By default, git-find searches the current index (cache).  This is the same
    as the default for git-ls-files(1).  You can specify one or more revs to
    search using any of the forms described in gitrevisions(7)
    <https://git-scm.com/docs/gitrevisions>.

    You can specify the special value "]]" (a double right bracket) to search
    the working tree that is currently checked out.  (Mnemonic: search *right*
    here.)  If you have an actual rev called "]]", git-find won't be able to
    help you.  Sorry!

        TODO? You can specify multiple ranges of revs separated by C<-o> (or its
        equivalent forms given in L</Operators>) or C<,>.  Comma is treated as
        equivalent to C<-o> when separating revs.

  Expression
    The expression includes one or more elements separated by "Operators". 
    Elements can be options, tests, or operators.

    Elements of expressions can be specified in a form similar to find(1). 
    Long elements (e.g., "-name") can start with a single or a double dash.

    Tests are of two types:

    Index tests
        These are tests that only require information from the git index, such
        as the name of the file and whether it is executable.  They are (at
        least on Unix-like systems):

        "-cmin", "-cnewer", "-ctime", "-empty", "-executable", "-false",
        "-gid", "-group", "-ilname", "-iname", "-inum", "-ipath", "-iregex",
        "-iwholename", "-level", "-mmin", "-mtime", "-name", "-nogroup",
        "-nouser", "-path", "-readable", "-regex", "-size", "-true", "-type",
        "-uid", "-user", "-wholename", "-writeable"

            TODO also -links, -lname, -perm, -samefile, -xtype?

    Detailed tests
        All tests other than index tests may require checking out a worktree
        with one or more of the given revs.  Therefore, they may be much
        slower than name-only tests.  However, if the only rev given is "]]"
        (working directory), detailed tests can be executed without checking
        out a worktree, so the slowdown is not as bad.

DIFFERENCES FROM FIND(1)
    In git-find but not in find(1): -ref, -rev

    In find(1) but not in git-find: find switches; TODO -xtype, -context?

WARNINGS
    If the "-W" option is given, warnings are enabled.  Possible warnings are:

    -Wdetailed
        Warn if a detailed test is used on a search scope other than "]]" (the
        current working tree).
