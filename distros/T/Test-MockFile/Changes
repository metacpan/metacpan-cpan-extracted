 - Fix for my $file_contents = do { local $/; <$fh> };
 - Mock CORE::GLOBAL::unlink and support directories for unlink

0.010   10/31/2018
 - Add .perltidyrc policy
 - When reporting strict mode violations, be sure to report the a stack location outside of our modules.
 - Report a stack trace for strict mode violations to determine the source of the problem.
 - Add an ignore hash for modules (like DynaLoader) which are allowed to open files.
 - Ignore STDIN/STDERR/STDOUT since tests often have to manipulate them and that's not really IO.
 - Autovivify a sysread where the buffer passed in is undef.
