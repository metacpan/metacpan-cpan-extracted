NAME
    Template::Plugin::Body - Strip HTML to just keep the body content

SYNOPSIS
      # _included.html
      <html>
      <head>
        <style ...>
      </head>
      <body>
      This is content we need the stylesheet to see properly.
      </body>
      </html>
  
      # mypage.html
      [% USE Body %]
      <html>
      <head>
        <style ...>
      </head>
      <body>
      Some content
      [% INCLUDE _included.html | Body %]
      Some more content
      </body>
      </html>

DESCRIPTION
    The things we do to support designers...

    When you are including a big chunk of HTML into a page via an include,
    you can have problems editing it in WYSIWYG editors because it won't
    have the stylesheets, meta tags and javascript libs that the main
    document does.

    So for the sake of designers, the best solution is to provide the
    includes with full HTML headers, including proper styles and so on. They
    can do what they like in Dreamweaver or Editor De Jour. Then when
    including, we strip the wrapping off to get just the content.

    And that's what this module does. It removes everything to keep only
    what is inside the body tags.
