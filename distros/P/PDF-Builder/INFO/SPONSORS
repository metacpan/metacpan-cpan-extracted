S P O N S O R S H I P S

We would like to thank the following individuals and organizations for
sponsoring new features in PDF::Builder: 


Amtivo Group, Kings Hill, Kent, England -- FontManager and Column with MD 
    and HTML markup. Also support added to PDF::Table to use these new
    features with PDF::Builder.


If you would like to see new features for PDF::Builder on an accelerated
schedule, please feel free to contact us (via catskilltech.com Contact page)
to discuss scope, schedule, and cost. Please keep in mind that such a 
sponsorship does NOT create any exclusive intellectual property belonging to
the sponsor! Rather, all results go into the public code repository for all
to use immediately. You simply get the features sooner, and your name engraved
on a plaque in this file (OK, just listed above).

On the other hand, if you have code (or at least, good algorithms) instead of
money to contribute, please see CONTRIBUTING.md for information on submitting
code changes.

If you wish to purchase new features for PDF::Builder (and/or PDF::Table or
any other open source product we provide) that are NOT released to the public,
that is, are your exclusive intellectual property, feel free to contact us for
a discussion of scope, schedule, and cost. Note that the cost will be higher,
as the world doesn't get to share in the benefits of this work! In addition,
it creates much more work for us if we need to maintain parallel versions of 
PDF::Builder. Please consider a sponsorship for work that will be released to 
the public, and benefit it.
