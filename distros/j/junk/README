SYNOPSIS
     use 5.010;
     use junk KnRlaCdiaXRlPSp0YWRwb2xlJ3dheD0qZGFyZSd5b3U9c3Vie3BvcH0K;
     no junk;

         or alarm my $accountant;

DESCRIPTION
    The "junk" module performs two very different tasks depending on whether
    you type `use junk` or `no junk`.

  `import`
    `use junk` takes each of its arguments, performs some unescaping on each,
    decodes them as base64, and then passes them each to `eval`.

    The unescaping is as follows:

     "_D0"   => "0"
     "_D1"   => "1"
     "_D2"   => "2"
     "_D3"   => "3"
     "_D4"   => "4"
     "_D5"   => "5"
     "_D6"   => "6"
     "_D7"   => "7"
     "_D8"   => "8"
     "_D9"   => "9"
     "_P"    => "+"
     "_S"    => "/"

    This allows base64 to be encoded as Perl barewords (provided you're not in
    strict mode).

    Called with no arguments, it switches off switch mode.

  `unimport`
    `no junk` is equivalent to saying `use strict 'subs', 'vars'`.

    I don't know about you, but 'refs' is the only part of strict that I ever
    disable, so `no junk` just enables all of strict except 'refs'.
