NAME

    Alien::Libarchive - Build and make available libarchive

VERSION

    version 0.28

SYNOPSIS

    Build.PL

     use Alien::Libarchive;
     use Module::Build;
     
     my $alien = Alien::Libarchive->new;
     my $build = Module::Build->new(
       ...
       extra_compiler_flags => [$alien->cflags],
       extra_linker_flags   => [$alien->libs],
       ...
     );
     
     $build->create_build_script;

    Makefile.PL

     use Alien::Libarchive;
     use ExtUtils::MakeMaker;
     
     my $alien = Alien::Libarchive;
     WriteMakefile(
       ...
       CCFLAGS => scalar $alien->cflags,
       LIBS    => [$alien->libs],
     );

    FFI::Platypus

     use Alien::Libarchive;
     use FFI::Platypus;
     
     my $ffi = FFI::Platypus->new(lib => [Alien::Libarchive->new->dlls]);
     $ffi->attach( archive_read_new => [] => 'opaque' );

DESCRIPTION

    This distribution installs libarchive so that it can be used by other
    Perl distributions. If already installed for your operating system, and
    it can be found, this distribution will use the libarchive that comes
    with your operating system, otherwise it will download it from the
    Internet, build and install it.

    If you set the environment variable ALIEN_LIBARCHIVE to 'share', this
    distribution will ignore any system libarchive found, and build from
    source instead. This may be desirable if your operating system comes
    with a very old version of libarchive and an upgrade path for the
    system libarchive is not possible.

    For partial compatibility with Alien::Base, this distribution will also
    honor the ALIEN_FORCE environment variable. Setting ALIEN_BASE to a
    true value is the same as setting ALIEN_LIBARCHIVE to 'share'.

 Requirements

  operating system install

    The development headers and libraries for libarchive

    Debian

      On Debian you can install these with this command:

       % sudo apt-get install libarchive-dev

    Cygwin

      On Cygwin, make sure that this package is installed

       libarchive-devel

    FreeBSD

      libarchive comes with FreeBSD as of version 5.3.

  from source install

    A C compiler and any prerequisites for building libarchive.

    Debian

      On Debian build-essential should be good enough:

       % sudo apt-get install build-essential

    Cygwin

      On Cygwin, I couldn't get libarchive to build without making a minor
      tweak to one of the include files. On Cygwin this module will patch
      libarchive before it attempts to build if it is version 3.1.2.

METHODS

 cflags

    Returns the C compiler flags necessary to build against libarchive.

    Returns flags as a list in list context and combined into a string in
    scalar context.

 libs

    Returns the library flags necessary to build against libarchive.

    Returns flags as a list in list context and combined into a string in
    scalar context.

 dlls

    Returns a list of dynamic libraries (usually a list of just one
    library) that make up libarchive. This can be used for FFI::Raw.

    Returns just the first dynamic library found in scalar context.

 version

    Returns the libarchive version.

 install_type

    Returns the install type, one of either system or share.

 pkg_config_dir

    Returns a path that contains the libarchive.pc file which can be used
    by pkg-config for linking against libarchive.

 pkg_config_name

    Returns the name by which pkg-config knows libarchive (should always be
    libarchive).

CAVEATS

    Debian Linux and FreeBSD (9.0) have been tested the most in development
    of this distribution.

    Patches to improve portability and platform support would be eagerly
    appreciated.

    If you reinstall this distribution, you may need to reinstall any
    distributions that depend on it as well.
