NAME

    Dist::Zilla::App::Command::aliendeps - (DEPRECATED) Print your alien
    distributions alien prerequisites

VERSION

    version 0.03

SYNOPSIS

     % dzil aliendeps | cpanm

DESCRIPTION

    NOTE: This Dist::Zilla subcommand is deprecated in favor of App::af
    which can produce useful results with alienfile + Alien::Build with the
    af missing command.

    Alien::Base based Alien distributions may have optional dependencies
    that are required when it is determined that a build from source code
    is necessary. This command probes your distribution for such optional
    requirements and lists them.

    This command of course works with Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Alien (and
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Alien), but will also work with any
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::ModuleBuild based distribution that emits an
    alien_bin_requires property.

OPTIONS

    --env

      Honor the ALIEN_FORCE and ALIEN_INSTALL_TYPE environment variables
      used by Alien::Base::ModuleBuild (see Alien::Base::ModuleBuild::API).
      That is do not list anything unless a source code build will be
      forced. This may be useful when invoked from a .travis.yml file.
