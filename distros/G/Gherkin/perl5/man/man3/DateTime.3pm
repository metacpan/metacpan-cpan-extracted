.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
DateTime is a class for the representation of date/time combinations,
and is part of the Perl DateTime project. For details on this project
please see <http://datetime.perl.org/>. The DateTime site has a \s-1FAQ\s0
which may help answer many \*(L"how do I do X?\*(R" questions. The \s-1FAQ\s0 is at
<http://datetime.perl.org/wiki/datetime/page/FAQ>.
.PP
It represents the Gregorian calendar, extended backwards in time
before its creation (in 1582). This is sometimes known as the
\&\*(L"proleptic Gregorian calendar\*(R". In this calendar, the first day of
the calendar (the epoch), is the first day of year 1, which
corresponds to the date which was (incorrectly) believed to be the
birth of Jesus Christ.
.PP
The calendar represented does have a year 0, and in that way differs
from how dates are often written using \*(L"\s-1BCE/CE\*(R"\s0 or \*(L"\s-1BC/AD\*(R".\s0
.PP
For infinite datetimes, please see the
DateTime::Infinite module.
.SH "USAGE"
.IX Header "USAGE"
.SS "0\-based Versus 1\-based Numbers"
.IX Subsection "0-based Versus 1-based Numbers"
The \f(CW\*(C`DateTime\*(C'\fR module follows a simple logic for determining whether or not a
given number is 0\-based or 1\-based.
.PP
Month, day of month, day of week, and day of year are 1\-based. Any
method that is 1\-based also has an equivalent 0\-based method ending in
\&\f(CW\*(C`_0\*(C'\fR. So for example, this class provides both \f(CW\*(C`day_of_week\*(C'\fR and
\&\f(CW\*(C`day_of_week_0\*(C'\fR methods.
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`day_of_week_0\*(C'\fR method still treats Monday as the first day of
the week.
.PP
All \fItime\fR\-related numbers such as hour, minute, and second are
0\-based.
.PP
Years are neither, as they can be both positive or negative, unlike
any other datetime component. There \fIis\fR a year 0.
.PP
There is no \f(CW\*(C`quarter_0\*(C'\fR method.
.SS "Error Handling"
.IX Subsection "Error Handling"
Some errors may cause this module to die with an error string. This
can only happen when calling constructor methods, methods that change
the object, such as \f(CW\*(C`set\*(C'\fR, or methods that take parameters.
Methods that retrieve information about the object, such as \f(CW\*(C`year\*(C'\fR
or \f(CW\*(C`epoch\*(C'\fR, will never die.
.SS "Locales"
.IX Subsection "Locales"
All the object methods which return names or abbreviations return data based
on a locale. This is done by setting the locale when constructing a DateTime
object. If this is not set, then \f(CW"en\-US"\fR is used.
.SS "Floating DateTimes"
.IX Subsection "Floating DateTimes"
The default time zone for new DateTime objects, except where stated
otherwise, is the \*(L"floating\*(R" time zone. This concept comes from the
iCal standard. A floating datetime is one which is not anchored to
any particular time zone. In addition, floating datetimes do not
include leap seconds, since we cannot apply them without knowing the
datetime's time zone.
.PP
The results of date math and comparison between a floating datetime
and one with a real time zone are not really valid, because one
includes leap seconds and the other does not. Similarly, the results
of datetime math between two floating datetimes and two datetimes with
time zones are not really comparable.
.PP
If you are planning to use any objects with a real time zone, it is
strongly recommended that you \fBdo not\fR mix these with floating
datetimes.
.SS "Math"
.IX Subsection "Math"
If you are going to be doing date math, please read the section \*(L"How DateTime
Math Works\*(R".
.SS "Determining the Local Time Zone Can Be Slow"
.IX Subsection "Determining the Local Time Zone Can Be Slow"
If \f(CW$ENV{TZ}\fR is not set, it may involve reading a number of files in \fI/etc\fR
or elsewhere. If you know that the local time zone won't change while your
code is running, and you need to make many objects for the local time zone, it
is strongly recommended that you retrieve the local time zone once and cache
it:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    our $App::LocalTZ = DateTime::TimeZone\->new( name => \*(Aqlocal\*(Aq );
\&
\&    # then everywhere else
\&
\&    my $dt = DateTime\->new( ..., time_zone => $App::LocalTZ );
.Ve
.PP
DateTime itself does not do this internally because local time zones can
change, and there's no good way to determine if it's changed without doing all
the work to look it up.
.SS "Far Future \s-1DST\s0"
.IX Subsection "Far Future DST"
Do not try to use named time zones (like \*(L"America/Chicago\*(R") with dates
very far in the future (thousands of years). The current
implementation of \f(CW\*(C`DateTime::TimeZone\*(C'\fR will use a huge amount of
memory calculating all the \s-1DST\s0 changes from now until the future
date. Use \s-1UTC\s0 or the floating time zone and you will be safe.
.SS "Globally Setting a Default Time Zone"
.IX Subsection "Globally Setting a Default Time Zone"
\&\fBWarning: This is very dangerous. Do this at your own risk!\fR
.PP
By default, \f(CW\*(C`DateTime\*(C'\fR uses either the floating time zone or \s-1UTC\s0 for newly
created objects, depending on the constructor.
.PP
You can force \f(CW\*(C`DateTime\*(C'\fR to use a different time zone by setting the
\&\f(CW\*(C`PERL_DATETIME_DEFAULT_TZ\*(C'\fR environment variable.
.PP
As noted above, this is very dangerous, as it affects all code that creates a
\&\f(CW\*(C`DateTime\*(C'\fR object, including modules from \s-1CPAN.\s0 If those modules expect the
normal default, then setting this can cause confusing breakage or subtly
broken data. Before setting this variable, you are strongly encouraged to
audit your \s-1CPAN\s0 dependencies to see how they use \f(CW\*(C`DateTime\*(C'\fR. Try running the
test suite for each dependency with this environment variable set before using
this in production.
.SS "Upper and Lower Bounds"
.IX Subsection "Upper and Lower Bounds"
Internally, dates are represented the number of days before or after
0001\-01\-01. This is stored as an integer, meaning that the upper and lower
bounds are based on your Perl's integer size (\f(CW$Config{ivsize}\fR).
.PP
The limit on 32\-bit systems is around 2^29 days, which gets you to year
(+/\-)1,469,903. On a 64\-bit system you get 2^62 days, to year
(+/\-)12,626,367,463,883,278 (12.626 quadrillion).
.SH "METHODS"
.IX Header "METHODS"
DateTime provides many methods. The documentation breaks them down into groups
based on what they do (constructor, accessors, modifiers, etc.).
.SS "Constructors"
.IX Subsection "Constructors"
All constructors can die when invalid parameters are given.
.PP
\fIWarnings\fR
.IX Subsection "Warnings"
.PP
Currently, constructors will warn if you try to create a far future DateTime
(year >= 5000) with any time zone besides floating or \s-1UTC.\s0 This can be very
slow if the time zone has future \s-1DST\s0 transitions that need to be
calculated. If the date is sufficiently far in the future this can be
\&\fIreally\fR slow (minutes).
.PP
All warnings from DateTime use the \f(CW\*(C`DateTime\*(C'\fR category and can be suppressed
with:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    no warnings \*(AqDateTime\*(Aq;
.Ve
.PP
This warning may be removed in the future if DateTime::TimeZone is made
much faster.
.PP

.PP
This class method accepts the following parameters:
.IP "\(bu" 4
year
.Sp
An integer year for the DateTime. This can be any integer number within the
valid range for your system (See \*(L"Upper and Lower Bounds\*(R"). This is
required.
.IP "\(bu" 4
month
.Sp
An integer from 1\-12. Defaults to 1.
.IP "\(bu" 4
day
.Sp
An integer from 1\-31. The value will be validated based on the month, to
prevent creating invalid dates like February 30. Defaults to 1.
.IP "\(bu" 4
hour
.Sp
An integer from 0\-23. Hour 0 is midnight at the beginning of the given date.
Defaults to 0.
.IP "\(bu" 4
minute
.Sp
An integer from 0\-59. Defaults to 0.
.IP "\(bu" 4
second
.Sp
An integer from 0\-61. Values of 60 or 61 are only allowed when the specified
date and time have a leap second. Defaults to 0.
.IP "\(bu" 4
nanosecond
.Sp
An integer that is greater than or equal to 0. If this number is greater than
1 billion, it will be normalized into the second value for the DateTime
object. Defaults to 0
.IP "\(bu" 4
locale
.Sp
A string containing a locale code, like \f(CW"en\-US"\fR or \f(CW"zh\-Hant\-TW"\fR, or an
object returned by \f(CW\*(C`DateTime::Locale\->load\*(C'\fR. See the DateTime::Locale
documentation for details. Defaults to the value of \f(CW\*(C`DateTime\->DefaultLocale\*(C'\fR, or \f(CW"en\-US"\fR if the class default has not been
set.
.IP "\(bu" 4
time_zone
.Sp
A string containing a time zone name like \*(L"America/Chicago\*(R" or a
DateTime::TimeZone object. Defaults to the value of
\&\f(CW$ENV{PERL_DATETIME_DEFAULT_TZ}\fR or \*(L"floating\*(R" if that env var is not
set. See \*(L"Globally Setting a Default Time Zone\*(R" for more details on that env
var (and why you should not use it).
.Sp
A string will simply be passed to the \f(CW\*(C`DateTime::TimeZone\->new\*(C'\fR method as
its \f(CW\*(C`name\*(C'\fR parameter. This string may be an Olson \s-1DB\s0 time zone name
(\*(L"America/Chicago\*(R"), an offset string (\*(L"+0630\*(R"), or the words \*(L"floating\*(R" or
\&\*(L"local\*(R". See the \f(CW\*(C`DateTime::TimeZone\*(C'\fR documentation for more details.
.IP "\(bu" 4
formatter
.Sp
An object or class name with a \f(CW\*(C`format_datetime\*(C'\fR method. This will be used to
stringify the DateTime object. This is optional. If it is not specified, then
stringification calls \f(CW\*(C`$self\->iso8601\*(C'\fR.
.PP
Invalid parameter types (like an array reference) will cause the constructor
to die.
.PP
Parsing Dates
.IX Subsection "Parsing Dates"
.PP
\&\fBThis module does not parse dates!\fR That means there is no
constructor to which you can pass things like \*(L"March 3, 1970 12:34\*(R".
.PP
Instead, take a look at the various
DateTime::Format::* <https://metacpan.org/search?q=datetime%3A%3Aformat>
modules on \s-1CPAN.\s0 These parse all sorts of different date formats, and you're
bound to find something that can handle your particular needs.
.PP
Ambiguous Local Times
.IX Subsection "Ambiguous Local Times"
.PP
Because of Daylight Saving Time, it is possible to specify a local
time that is ambiguous. For example, in the \s-1US\s0 in 2003, the
transition from to saving to standard time occurred on October 26, at
02:00:00 local time. The local clock changed from 01:59:59 (saving
time) to 01:00:00 (standard time). This means that the hour from
01:00:00 through 01:59:59 actually occurs twice, though the \s-1UTC\s0 time
continues to move forward.
.PP
If you specify an ambiguous time, then the latest \s-1UTC\s0 time is always
used, in effect always choosing standard time. In this case, you can
simply subtract an hour from the object in order to move to saving time,
for example:
.PP
.Vb 10
\&    # This object represent 01:30:00 standard time
\&    my $dt = DateTime\->new(
\&        year      => 2003,
\&        month     => 10,
\&        day       => 26,
\&        hour      => 1,
\&        minute    => 30,
\&        second    => 0,
\&        time_zone => \*(AqAmerica/Chicago\*(Aq,
\&    );
\&
\&    print $dt\->hms;    # prints 01:30:00
\&
\&    # Now the object represent 01:30:00 saving time
\&    $dt\->subtract( hours => 1 );
\&
\&    print $dt\->hms;    # still prints 01:30:00
.Ve
.PP
Alternately, you could create the object with the \s-1UTC\s0 time zone and
then call the \f(CW\*(C`set_time_zone\*(C'\fR method to change the time zone. This
is a good way to ensure that the time is not ambiguous.
.PP
Invalid Local Times
.IX Subsection "Invalid Local Times"
.PP
Another problem introduced by Daylight Saving Time is that certain
local times just do not exist. For example, in the \s-1US\s0 in 2003, the
transition from standard to saving time occurred on April 6, at the
change to 2:00:00 local time. The local clock changed from 01:59:59
(standard time) to 03:00:00 (saving time). This means that there is
no 02:00:00 through 02:59:59 on April 6!
.PP
Attempting to create an invalid time currently causes a fatal error.
.PP
\fIDateTime\->from_epoch( epoch => \f(CI$epoch\fI, ... )\fR
.IX Subsection "DateTime->from_epoch( epoch => $epoch, ... )"
.PP
This class method can be used to construct a new DateTime object from
an epoch time instead of components. Just as with the \f(CW\*(C`new\*(C'\fR
method, it accepts \f(CW\*(C`time_zone\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`locale\*(C'\fR, and \f(CW\*(C`formatter\*(C'\fR parameters.
.PP
If the epoch value is a non-integral value, it will be rounded to nearest
microsecond.
.PP
By default, the returned object will be in the \s-1UTC\s0 time zone.
.PP
\fIDateTime\->now( ... )\fR
.IX Subsection "DateTime->now( ... )"
.PP
This class method is equivalent to calling \f(CW\*(C`from_epoch\*(C'\fR with the
value returned from Perl's \f(CW\*(C`time\*(C'\fR function. Just as with the
\&\f(CW\*(C`new\*(C'\fR method, it accepts \f(CW\*(C`time_zone\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`locale\*(C'\fR parameters.
.PP
By default, the returned object will be in the \s-1UTC\s0 time zone.
.PP
If you want sub-second resolution, use the DateTime::HiRes module's \f(CW\*(C`DateTime::HiRes\->now\*(C'\fR method instead.
.PP
\fIDateTime\->today( ... )\fR
.IX Subsection "DateTime->today( ... )"
.PP
This class method is equivalent to:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    DateTime\->now(@_)\->truncate( to => \*(Aqday\*(Aq );
.Ve
.PP
\fIDateTime\->last_day_of_month( ... )\fR
.IX Subsection "DateTime->last_day_of_month( ... )"
.PP
This constructor takes the same arguments as can be given to the
\&\f(CW\*(C`new\*(C'\fR method, except for \f(CW\*(C`day\*(C'\fR. Additionally, both \f(CW\*(C`year\*(C'\fR and
\&\f(CW\*(C`month\*(C'\fR are required.
.PP
\fIDateTime\->from_day_of_year( ... )\fR
.IX Subsection "DateTime->from_day_of_year( ... )"
.PP
This constructor takes the same arguments as can be given to the
\&\f(CW\*(C`new\*(C'\fR method, except that it does not accept a \f(CW\*(C`month\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`day\*(C'\fR
argument. Instead, it requires both \f(CW\*(C`year\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`day_of_year\*(C'\fR. The
day of year must be between 1 and 366, and 366 is only allowed for
leap years.
.PP
\fIDateTime\->from_object( object => \f(CI$object\fI, ... )\fR
.IX Subsection "DateTime->from_object( object => $object, ... )"
.PP
This class method can be used to construct a new DateTime object from
any object that implements the \f(CW\*(C`utc_rd_values\*(C'\fR method. All
\&\f(CW\*(C`DateTime::Calendar\*(C'\fR modules must implement this method in order to
provide cross-calendar compatibility. This method accepts a
\&\f(CW\*(C`locale\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`formatter\*(C'\fR parameter
.PP
If the object passed to this method has a \f(CW\*(C`time_zone\*(C'\fR method, that is used to
set the time zone of the newly created \f(CW\*(C`DateTime\*(C'\fR object.
.PP
Otherwise, the returned object will be in the floating time zone.
.PP
\fI\f(CI$dt\fI\->clone\fR
.IX Subsection "$dt->clone"
.PP
This object method returns a new object that is replica of the object
upon which the method is called.
.ie n .SS """Get"" Methods"
.el .SS "``Get'' Methods"
.IX Subsection "Get Methods"
This class has many methods for retrieving information about an
object.
.PP
\fI\f(CI$dt\fI\->year\fR
.IX Subsection "$dt->year"
.PP
Returns the year.
.PP
\fI\f(CI$dt\fI\->ce_year\fR
.IX Subsection "$dt->ce_year"
.PP
Returns the year according to the \s-1BCE/CE\s0 numbering system. The year

.PP
\fI\f(CI$dt\fI\->era_name\fR

.Ve
.PP
The \f(CW$optional_separator\fR parameter allows you to override the separator
between the date and time, for e.g. \f(CW\*(C`$dt\->datetime(q{ })\*(C'\fR.
.PP
This method is also available as \f(CW\*(C`$dt\->iso8601\*(C'\fR, but it's not really a
very good \s-1ISO8601\s0 format, as it lacks a time zone. If called as \f(CW\*(C`$dt\->iso8601\*(C'\fR you cannot change the separator, as \s-1ISO8601\s0 specifies that \*(L"T\*(R"
must be used to separate them.
.PP
\fI\f(CI$dt\fI\->rfc3339\fR
.IX Subsection "$dt->rfc3339"
.PP
This formats a datetime in \s-1RFC3339\s0 format. This is the same as \f(CW\*(C`$dt\->datetime\*(C'\fR with an added offset at the end of the string except if the
time zone is the floating time zone.
.PP
If the offset is '+00:00' then this is represented as 'Z'. Otherwise the
offset is formatted with a leading sign (+/\-) and a colon separated numeric
offset with hours and minutes. If the offset has a non-zero seconds component,
that is also included.
.PP
\fI\f(CI$dt\fI\->stringify\fR
.IX Subsection "$dt->stringify"
.PP
This method returns a stringified version of the object. It is also how
stringification overloading is implemented. If the object has a formatter,
then its \f(CW\*(C`format_datetime\*(C'\fR method is used to produce a string. Otherwise,
this method calls \f(CW\*(C`$dt\->iso8601\*(C'\fR to produce a string. See \*(L"Formatters
And Stringification\*(R" for details.
.PP
\fI\f(CI$dt\fI\->is_leap_year\fR

.IX Subsection "$dt->week"
.PP
.Vb 1
\&   my ( $week_year, $week_number ) = $dt\->week;

.PP
Returns information about the calendar week for the date. The values returned
by this method are also available separately through the \f(CW\*(C`$dt\->week_year\*(C'\fR
and \f(CW\*(C`$dt\->week_number\*(C'\fR methods.
.PP
The first week of the year is defined by \s-1ISO\s0 as the one which contains
the fourth day of January, which is equivalent to saying that it's the
first week to overlap the new year by at least four days.
.PP
Typically the week year will be the same as the year that the object
is in, but dates at the very beginning of a calendar year often end up
in the last week of the prior year, and similarly, the final few days
of the year may be placed in the first week of the next year.
.PP
\fI\f(CI$dt\fI\->week_year\fR
.IX Subsection "$dt->week_year"
.PP
Returns the year of the week. See \f(CW\*(C`$dt\->week\*(C'\fR for details.

.PP
\fI\f(CI$dt\fI\->week_of_month\fR
.IX Subsection "$dt->week_of_month"
.PP
The week of the month, from 0..5. The first week of the month is the
first week that contains a Thursday. This is based on the \s-1ICU\s0
definition of week of month, and correlates to the \s-1ISO8601\s0 week of
year definition. A day in the week \fIbefore\fR the week with the first
Thursday will be week 0.
.PP
\fI\f(CI$dt\fI\->jd, \f(CI$dt\fI\->mjd\fR
.IX Subsection "$dt->jd, $dt->mjd"
.PP
These return the Julian Day and Modified Julian Day, respectively.
The value returned is a floating point number. The fractional portion
of the number represents the time portion of the datetime.
.PP
The Julian Day is a count of days since the beginning of the Julian Period,
which starts with day 0 at noon on January 1, \-4712.
.PP
The Modified Julian Day is a count of days since midnight on November 17,
1858.
.PP
These methods always refer to the local time, so the Julian Day is the same
for a given datetime regardless of its time zone. Or in other words,
2020\-12\-04T13:01:57 in \*(L"America/Chicago\*(R" has the same Julian Day as
2020\-12\-04T13:01:57 in \*(L"Asia/Taipei\*(R".
.PP
\fI\f(CI$dt\fI\->time_zone\fR

currently in Daylight Saving Time or not.
.PP
\fI\f(CI$dt\fI\->time_zone_long_name\fR
.IX Subsection "$dt->time_zone_long_name"
.PP
This is a shortcut for \f(CW\*(C`$dt\->time_zone\->name\*(C'\fR. It's provided so
that one can use \*(L"%{time_zone_long_name}\*(R" as a strftime format
specifier.
.PP
\fI\f(CI$dt\fI\->time_zone_short_name\fR
.IX Subsection "$dt->time_zone_short_name"
.PP
This method returns the time zone abbreviation for the current time zone, such
as \*(L"\s-1PST\*(R"\s0 or \*(L"\s-1GMT\*(R".\s0 These names are \fBnot\fR definitive, and should not be used
in any application intended for general use by users around the world. That's
because it's possible for multiple time zones to have the same abbreviation.
.PP
\fI\f(CI$dt\fI\->strftime( \f(CI$format\fI, ... )\fR
.IX Subsection "$dt->strftime( $format, ... )"
.PP
This method implements functionality similar to the \f(CW\*(C`strftime\*(C'\fR
method in C. However, if given multiple format strings, then it will
return multiple scalars, one for each format string.
.PP
See the \*(L"strftime Patterns\*(R" section for a list of all possible
strftime patterns.
.PP
If you give a pattern that doesn't exist, then it is simply treated as
text.
.PP
Note that any deviation from the \s-1POSIX\s0 standard is probably a bug. DateTime
should match the output of \f(CW\*(C`POSIX::strftime\*(C'\fR for any given pattern.
.PP
\fI\f(CI$dt\fI\->format_cldr( \f(CI$format\fI, ... )\fR
.IX Subsection "$dt->format_cldr( $format, ... )"
.PP
This method implements formatting based on the \s-1CLDR\s0 date patterns. If
given multiple format strings, then it will return multiple scalars,
one for each format string.
.PP
See the \*(L"\s-1CLDR\s0 Patterns\*(R" section for a list of all possible \s-1CLDR\s0
patterns.
.PP
If you give a pattern that doesn't exist, then it is simply treated as
text.
.PP
\fI\f(CI$dt\fI\->epoch\fR
.IX Subsection "$dt->epoch"
.PP
Returns the \s-1UTC\s0 epoch value for the datetime object. Datetimes before the
start of the epoch will be returned as a negative number.
.PP
The return value from this method is always an integer number of seconds.
.PP
Since the epoch does not account for leap seconds, the epoch time for
1972\-12\-31T23:59:60 (\s-1UTC\s0) is exactly the same as that for
1973\-01\-01T00:00:00.
.PP
\fI\f(CI$dt\fI\->hires_epoch\fR
.IX Subsection "$dt->hires_epoch"
.PP
Returns the epoch as a floating point number. The floating point
portion of the value represents the nanosecond value of the object.
This method is provided for compatibility with the \f(CW\*(C`Time::HiRes\*(C'\fR
module.
.PP
Note that this method suffers from the imprecision of floating point numbers,
and the result may end up rounded to an arbitrary degree depending on your
platform.
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    my $dt = DateTime\->new( year => 2012, nanosecond => 4 );

\fI\f(CI$dt\fI\->utc_rd_values\fR
.IX Subsection "$dt->utc_rd_values"
.PP
Returns the current \s-1UTC\s0 Rata Die days, seconds, and nanoseconds as a

modules to create objects based on the values provided by this object.
.PP
\fI\f(CI$dt\fI\->local_rd_values\fR
.IX Subsection "$dt->local_rd_values"
.PP
Returns the current local Rata Die days, seconds, and nanoseconds as a

DateTime::Event::Recurrence.
.PP
\fI\f(CI$dt\fI\->leap_seconds\fR
.IX Subsection "$dt->leap_seconds"

.PP
These are shortcuts to calling \f(CW\*(C`set\*(C'\fR with a single key. They all
take a single parameter.
.PP
\fI\f(CI$dt\fI\->truncate( to => ... )\fR
.IX Subsection "$dt->truncate( to => ... )"
.PP
This method allows you to reset some of the local time components in the
object to their \*(L"zero\*(R" values. The \f(CW\*(C`to\*(C'\fR parameter is used to specify which
values to truncate, and it may be one of \f(CW"year"\fR, \f(CW"quarter"\fR, \f(CW"month"\fR,
\&\f(CW"week"\fR, \f(CW"local_week"\fR, \f(CW"day"\fR, \f(CW"hour"\fR, \f(CW"minute"\fR, or \f(CW"second"\fR.
.PP
For example, if \f(CW"month"\fR is specified, then the local day becomes 1, and the
hour, minute, and second all become 0.
.PP
If \f(CW"week"\fR is given, then the datetime is set to the Monday of the week in
which it occurs, and the time components are all set to 0. If you truncate to
\&\f(CW"local_week"\fR, then the first day of the week is locale-dependent. For
example, in the \f(CW"en\-US"\fR locale, the first day of the week is Sunday.
.PP
\fI\f(CI$dt\fI\->set_locale($locale)\fR
.IX Subsection "$dt->set_locale($locale)"
.PP
Sets the object's locale. You can provide either a locale code like \f(CW"en\-US"\fR

.PP
\fI\f(CI$dt\fI\->set_time_zone($tz)\fR
.IX Subsection "$dt->set_time_zone($tz)"
.PP
This method accepts either a time zone object or a string that can be passed
as the \f(CW\*(C`name\*(C'\fR parameter to \f(CW\*(C`DateTime::TimeZone\->new\*(C'\fR. If the new time
zone's offset is different from the old time zone, then the \fIlocal\fR time is
adjusted accordingly.

If the old time zone was a floating time zone, then no adjustments to
the local time are made, except to account for leap seconds. If the
new time zone is floating, then the \fI\s-1UTC\s0\fR time is adjusted in order
to leave the local time untouched.

This method returns a new DateTime::Duration object representing

the object from which \f(CW$datetime\fR is subtracted. For example:
.PP
.Vb 4

.PP
Note that this duration is not an absolute measure of the amount of
time between the two datetimes, because the length of a month varies,
as well as due to the presence of leap seconds.

The returned duration may have deltas for months, days, minutes,
seconds, and nanoseconds.

Each of these methods returns a new DateTime::Duration object representing
some portion of the difference between two datetimes.  The \f(CW\*(C`$dt\->delta_md\*(C'\fR method returns a duration which contains only the month and day portions of
the duration is represented. The \f(CW\*(C`$dt\->delta_days\*(C'\fR method returns a
duration which contains only days.
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`$dt\->delta_md\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`$dt\->delta_days\*(C'\fR methods truncate the
duration so that any fractional portion of a day is ignored. Both of these

ignore the time zone.

way to accurately measure the absolute amount of time between two datetimes,
since units larger than a second do not represent a fixed number of seconds.

This method compare two DateTime objects. The semantics are compatible with
Perl's \f(CW\*(C`sort\*(C'\fR function; it returns \f(CW\*(C`\-1\*(C'\fR if \f(CW\*(C`$dt1 < $dt2\*(C'\fR, \f(CW0\fR if
\&\f(CW\*(C`$dt1 == $dt2\*(C'\fR, \f(CW1\fR if \f(CW\*(C`$dt1 > $dt2\*(C'\fR.
.PP
If one of the two DateTime objects has a floating time zone, it will
first be converted to the time zone of the other object. This is what
you want most of the time, but it can lead to inconsistent results
when you compare a number of DateTime objects, some of which are
floating, and some of which are in other time zones.
.PP
If you want to have consistent results (because you want to sort an array of
objects, for example), you can use the \f(CW\*(C`compare_ignore_floating\*(C'\fR method:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    @dates = sort { DateTime\->compare_ignore_floating( $a, $b ) } @dates;
.Ve
.PP
In this case, objects with a floating time zone will be sorted as if
they were \s-1UTC\s0 times.
.PP
Since DateTime objects overload comparison operators, this:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    @dates = sort @dates;
.Ve
.PP
is equivalent to this:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    @dates = sort { DateTime\->compare( $a, $b ) } @dates;

DateTime objects can be compared to any other calendar class that implements
the \f(CW\*(C`utc_rd_values\*(C'\fR method.
.SS "Testing Code That Uses DateTime"

If you are trying to test code that calls uses DateTime, you may want to be to
explicitly set the value returned by Perl's \f(CW\*(C`time\*(C'\fR builtin. This builtin is
called by \f(CW\*(C`DateTime\->now\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`DateTime\->today\*(C'\fR.
.PP
You can override \f(CW\*(C`CORE::GLOBAL::time\*(C'\fR, but this will only work if you do this
\&\fBbefore\fR loading DateTime. If doing this is inconvenient, you can also
override \f(CW\*(C`DateTime::_core_time\*(C'\fR:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    no warnings \*(Aqredefine\*(Aq;
\&    local *DateTime::_core_time = sub { return 42 };
.Ve
.PP
DateTime is guaranteed to call this subroutine to get the current \f(CW\*(C`time\*(C'\fR
value. You can also override the \f(CW\*(C`_core_time\*(C'\fR sub in a subclass of DateTime
and use that.

If you want to simplify your life and not have to think too hard about
the nitty-gritty of datetime math, I have several recommendations:
.IP "\(bu" 4
use the floating time zone
.Sp
If you do not care about time zones or leap seconds, use the
\&\*(L"floating\*(R" timezone:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    my $dt = DateTime\->now( time_zone => \*(Aqfloating\*(Aq );
.Ve
.Sp
Math done on two objects in the floating time zone produces very
predictable results.
.Sp
Note that in most cases you will want to start by creating an object in a
specific zone and \fIthen\fR convert it to the floating time zone. When an object
goes from a real zone to the floating zone, the time for the object remains
the same.
.Sp
This means that passing the floating zone to a constructor may not do what you
want.
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    my $dt = DateTime\->now( time_zone => \*(Aqfloating\*(Aq );
.Ve
.Sp
is equivalent to
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    my $dt = DateTime\->now( time_zone => \*(AqUTC\*(Aq )\->set_time_zone(\*(Aqfloating\*(Aq);
.Ve
.Sp
This might not be what you wanted. Instead, you may prefer to do this:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    my $dt = DateTime\->now( time_zone => \*(Aqlocal\*(Aq )\->set_time_zone(\*(Aqfloating\*(Aq);
.Ve
.IP "\(bu" 4
use \s-1UTC\s0 for all calculations
.Sp
If you do care about time zones (particularly \s-1DST\s0) or leap seconds,
try to use non-UTC time zones for presentation and user input only.
Convert to \s-1UTC\s0 immediately and convert back to the local time zone for
presentation:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    my $dt = DateTime\->new( %user_input, time_zone => $user_tz );
\&    $dt\->set_time_zone(\*(AqUTC\*(Aq);
\&
\&    # do various operations \- store it, retrieve it, add, subtract, etc.
\&
\&    $dt\->set_time_zone($user_tz);
\&    print $dt\->datetime;
.Ve
.IP "\(bu" 4
math on non-UTC time zones
.Sp
If you need to do date math on objects with non-UTC time zones, please read
the caveats below carefully. The results \f(CW\*(C`DateTime\*(C'\fR produces are predictable,
correct, and mostly intuitive, but datetime math gets very ugly when time
zones are involved, and there are a few strange corner cases involving
subtraction of two datetimes across a \s-1DST\s0 change.
.Sp
If you can always use the floating or \s-1UTC\s0 time zones, you can skip ahead to
\&\*(L"Leap Seconds and Date Math\*(R"
.IP "\(bu" 4
date vs datetime math
.Sp
If you only care about the date (calendar) portion of a datetime, you should
use either \f(CW\*(C`$dt\->delta_md\*(C'\fR> or \f(CW\*(C`$dt\->delta_days\*(C'\fR, not \f(CW\*(C`$dt\->subtract_datetime\*(C'\fR. This will give predictable, unsurprising results,
free from DST-related complications.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW$dt\fR\->subtract_datetime and \f(CW$dt\fR\->add_duration
.Sp
You must convert your datetime objects to the \s-1UTC\s0 time zone before
doing date math if you want to make sure that the following formulas
are always true:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&    $dt2 \- $dt1 = $dur
\&    $dt1 + $dur = $dt2
\&    $dt2 \- $dur = $dt1
.Ve
.Sp
Note that using \f(CW\*(C`$dt\->delta_days\*(C'\fR ensures that this formula always works,
regardless of the time zones of the objects involved, as does using \f(CW\*(C`$dt\->subtract_datetime_absolute\*(C'\fR. Other methods of subtraction are not
always reversible.
.IP "\(bu" 4
never do math on two objects where only one is in the floating time zone
.Sp
The date math code accounts for leap seconds whenever the \f(CW\*(C`DateTime\*(C'\fR object
is not in the floating time zone. If you try to do math where one object is in
the floating zone and the other isn't, the results will be confusing and
wrong.
.PP
\fIAdding a Duration to a DateTime\fR
.IX Subsection "Adding a Duration to a DateTime"
.PP
The parts of a duration can be broken down into five parts. These are months,
days, minutes, seconds, and nanoseconds. Adding one month to a date is
different than adding 4 weeks or 28, 29, 30, or 31 days.  Similarly, due to
\&\s-1DST\s0 and leap seconds, adding a day can be different than adding 86,400
seconds, and adding a minute is not exactly the same as 60 seconds.
.PP
We cannot convert between these units, except for seconds and nanoseconds,
because there is no fixed conversion between most pairs of units. That is
because of things like leap seconds, \s-1DST\s0 changes, etc.
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`DateTime\*(C'\fR always adds (or subtracts) days, then months, minutes, and then
seconds and nanoseconds. If there are any boundary overflows, these are
normalized at each step. For the days and months the local (not \s-1UTC\s0) values
are used. For minutes and seconds, the local values are used. This generally
just works.
.PP
This means that adding one month and one day to February 28, 2003 will
produce the date April 1, 2003, not March 29, 2003.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    my $dt = DateTime\->new( year => 2003, month => 2, day => 28 );
\&
\&    $dt\->add( months => 1, days => 1 );
\&
\&    # 2003\-04\-01 \- the result
.Ve
.PP
On the other hand, if we add months first, and then separately add
days, we end up with March 29, 2003:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    $dt\->add( months => 1 )\->add( days => 1 );
\&
\&    # 2003\-03\-29
.Ve
.PP
We see similar strangeness when math crosses a \s-1DST\s0 boundary:
.PP
.Vb 8
\&    my $dt = DateTime\->new(
\&        year      => 2003,
\&        month     => 4,
\&        day       => 5,
\&        hour      => 1,
\&        minute    => 58,
\&        time_zone => "America/Chicago",
\&    );
\&
\&    $dt\->add( days => 1, minutes => 3 );
\&    # 2003\-04\-06 02:01:00
\&
\&    $dt\->add( minutes => 3 )\->add( days => 1 );
\&    # 2003\-04\-06 03:01:00
.Ve
.PP
Note that if you converted the datetime object to \s-1UTC\s0 first you would
get predictable results.
.PP
If you want to know how many seconds a DateTime::Duration object
represents, you have to add it to a datetime to find out, so you could do:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    my $now   = DateTime\->now( time_zone => \*(AqUTC\*(Aq );
\&    my $later = $now\->clone\->add_duration($duration);
\&
\&    my $seconds_dur = $later\->subtract_datetime_absolute($now);
.Ve
.PP
This returns a DateTime::Duration which only contains seconds and
nanoseconds.
.PP
If we were add the duration to a different \f(CW\*(C`DateTime\*(C'\fR object we might get a
different number of seconds.
.PP
DateTime::Duration supports three different end-of-month algorithms for
adding months. This comes into play when an addition results in a day past the
end of the following month (for example, adding one month to January 30).
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    # 2010\-08\-31 + 1 month = 2010\-10\-01
\&    $dt\->add( months => 1, end_of_month => \*(Aqwrap\*(Aq );
\&
\&    # 2010\-01\-30 + 1 month = 2010\-02\-28
\&    $dt\->add( months => 1, end_of_month => \*(Aqlimit\*(Aq );
\&
\&    # 2010\-04\-30 + 1 month = 2010\-05\-31
\&    $dt\->add( months => 1, end_of_month => \*(Aqpreserve\*(Aq );
.Ve
.PP
By default, it uses \f(CW"wrap"\fR for positive durations and \f(CW"preserve"\fR for
negative durations. See DateTime::Duration for a detailed explanation of
these algorithms.
.PP
If you need to do lots of work with durations, take a look at the
DateTime::Format::Duration module, which lets you present information from
durations in many useful ways.
.PP
There are other subtract/delta methods in \f(CW\*(C`DateTime\*(C'\fR to generate different
types of durations. These methods are \f(CW\*(C`$dt\->subtract_datetime\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`$dt\->subtract_datetime_absolute\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`$dt\->delta_md\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`$dt\->delta_days\*(C'\fR, and \f(CW\*(C`$dt\->delta_ms\*(C'\fR.

\fIDateTime Subtraction\fR

Date subtraction is done based solely on the two object's local datetimes,

first before subtraction. This is best explained through examples:

The first of these probably makes the most sense:

.PP
.Vb 9

.Ve
.PP
This seems obvious until you realize that subtracting 60 minutes from \f(CW$dt2\fR

are accounting for a 25 hour day.

Date math operations are not always reversible. This is because of the way
that addition operations are ordered. As was discussed earlier, adding 1 day

3 minutes and 1 day in two separate calls.

If we take a duration returned from \f(CW\*(C`$dt\->subtract_datetime\*(C'\fR and then try

The \f(CW\*(C`$dt\->subtract_duration\*(C'\fR operation gives us a (perhaps) unexpected
answer because it first subtracts one day to get 2003\-04\-05T03:01:00
and then subtracts 3 minutes to get the final result.
.PP
If we explicitly reverse the order we can get the original value of
\&\f(CW$dt1\fR. This can be facilitated by the DateTime::Duration class's \f(CW\*(C`$dur\->calendar_duration\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`$dur\->clock_duration\*(C'\fR methods:

\fILeap Seconds and Date Math\fR
.IX Subsection "Leap Seconds and Date Math"
.PP
The presence of leap seconds can cause even more anomalies in date
math. For example, the following is a legal datetime:
.PP
.Vb 9
\&    my $dt = DateTime\->new(
\&        year      => 1972,
\&        month     => 12,

.Ve
.PP
If we add one month ...
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    $dt\->add( months => 1 );
.Ve
.PP
\&... the datetime is now \*(L"1973\-02\-01 00:00:00\*(R", because there is no 23:59:60 on
1973\-01\-31.
.PP
Leap seconds also force us to distinguish between minutes and seconds
during date math. Given the following datetime ...
.PP
.Vb 9
\&    my $dt = DateTime\->new(
\&        year      => 1972,
\&        month     => 12,

\&        second    => 30,
\&        time_zone => \*(AqUTC\*(Aq
\&    );
.Ve
.PP
\&... we will get different results when adding 1 minute than we get if we add
60 seconds. This is because in this case, the last minute of the day,
beginning at 23:59:00, actually contains 61 seconds.
.PP
Here are the results we get:
.PP
.Vb 10
\&    # 1972\-12\-31 23:59:30 \- our starting datetime
\&    my $dt = DateTime\->new(

\fILocal vs. \s-1UTC\s0 and 24 hours vs. 1 day\fR
.IX Subsection "Local vs. UTC and 24 hours vs. 1 day"
.PP
When math crosses a daylight saving boundary, a single day may have
more or less than 24 hours.
.PP
For example, if you do this ...
.PP
.Vb 7
\&    my $dt = DateTime\->new(
\&        year      => 2003,
\&        month     => 4,
\&        day       => 5,
\&        hour      => 2,
\&        time_zone => \*(AqAmerica/Chicago\*(Aq,
\&    );
\&
\&    $dt\->add( days => 1 );
.Ve
.PP
\&... then you will produce an \fIinvalid\fR local time, and therefore an exception
will be thrown.
.PP
However, this works ...
.PP
.Vb 7
\&    my $dt = DateTime\->new(
\&        year      => 2003,
\&        month     => 4,
\&        day       => 5,
\&        hour      => 2,
\&        time_zone => \*(AqAmerica/Chicago\*(Aq,
\&    );
\&
\&    $dt\->add( hours => 24 );
.Ve
.PP
\&... and produces a datetime with the local time of \*(L"03:00\*(R".
.PP
If all this makes your head hurt, there is a simple alternative. Just convert
your datetime object to the \*(L"\s-1UTC\*(R"\s0 time zone before doing date math on it, and
switch it back to the local time zone afterwards. This avoids the possibility
of having date math throw an exception, and makes sure that 1 day equals 24
hours. Of course, this may not always be desirable, so caveat user!
.SS "Overloading"
.IX Subsection "Overloading"
This module explicitly overloads the addition (+), subtraction (\-), string and
numeric comparison operators. This means that the following all do sensible
things:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    my $new_dt = $dt + $duration_obj;
\&
\&    my $new_dt = $dt \- $duration_obj;
\&
\&    my $duration_obj = $dt \- $new_dt;
\&
\&    foreach my $dt ( sort @dts ) {...}
.Ve
.PP
Additionally, the fallback parameter is set to true, so other
derivable operators (+=, \-=, etc.) will work properly. Do not expect
increment (++) or decrement (\-\-) to do anything useful.
.PP
The string comparison operators, \f(CW\*(C`eq\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`ne\*(C'\fR, will use the string
value to compare with non-DateTime objects.
.PP
DateTime objects do not have a numeric value, using \f(CW\*(C`==\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`<=>\*(C'\fR to compare a DateTime object with a non-DateTime object will result
in an exception. To safely sort mixed DateTime and non-DateTime
objects, use \f(CW\*(C`sort { $a cmp $b } @dates\*(C'\fR.
.PP
The module also overloads stringification using the object's
formatter, defaulting to \f(CW\*(C`iso8601\*(C'\fR method. See \*(L"Formatters And
Stringification\*(R" for details.
.SS "Formatters And Stringification"
.IX Subsection "Formatters And Stringification"
You can optionally specify a \f(CW\*(C`formatter\*(C'\fR, which is usually a
\&\f(CW\*(C`DateTime::Format::*\*(C'\fR object or class, to control the stringification of the
DateTime object.
.PP
Any of the constructor methods can accept a formatter argument:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    my $formatter = DateTime::Format::Strptime\->new(...);
\&    my $dt        = DateTime\->new( year => 2004, formatter => $formatter );
.Ve
.PP
Or, you can set it afterwards:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    $dt\->set_formatter($formatter);
\&    $formatter = $dt\->formatter;
.Ve
.PP
Once you set the formatter, the overloaded stringification method will
use the formatter. If unspecified, the \f(CW\*(C`iso8601\*(C'\fR method is used.
.PP
A formatter can be handy when you know that in your application you
want to stringify your DateTime objects into a special format all the
time, for example in Postgres format.
.PP
If you provide a formatter class name or object, it must implement a
\&\f(CW\*(C`format_datetime\*(C'\fR method. This method will be called with just the
\&\f(CW\*(C`DateTime\*(C'\fR object as its argument.
.SS "\s-1CLDR\s0 Patterns"
.IX Subsection "CLDR Patterns"
The \s-1CLDR\s0 pattern language is both more powerful and more complex than
strftime. Unlike strftime patterns, you often have to explicitly
escape text that you do not want formatted, as the patterns are simply
letters without any prefix.
.PP
For example, \f(CW"yyyy\-MM\-dd"\fR is a valid \s-1CLDR\s0 pattern. If you want to include
any lower or upper case \s-1ASCII\s0 characters as-is, you can surround them with
single quotes ('). If you want to include a single quote, you must escape it
as two single quotes ('').
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    my $pattern1 = q{\*(AqToday is \*(Aq EEEE};
\&    my $pattern2 = q{\*(AqIt is now\*(Aq h \*(Aqo\*(Aq\*(Aqclock\*(Aq a};
.Ve
.PP
Spaces and any non-letter text will always be passed through as-is.
.PP
Many \s-1CLDR\s0 patterns which produce numbers will pad the number with leading
zeroes depending on the length of the format specifier. For example, \f(CW"h"\fR
represents the current hour from 1\-12. If you specify \f(CW"hh"\fR then hours 1\-9
will have a leading zero prepended.
.PP
However, \s-1CLDR\s0 often uses five of a letter to represent the narrow form
of a pattern. This inconsistency is necessary for backwards
compatibility.
.PP
There are many cases where \s-1CLDR\s0 patterns distinguish between the \*(L"format\*(R" and
\&\*(L"stand-alone\*(R" forms of a pattern. The format pattern is used when the thing in
question is being placed into a larger string. The stand-alone form is used
when displaying that item by itself, for example in a calendar.
.PP
There are also many cases where \s-1CLDR\s0 provides three sizes for each item, wide
(the full name), abbreviated, and narrow. The narrow form is often just a
single character, for example \*(L"T\*(R" for \*(L"Tuesday\*(R", and may not be unique.
.PP
\&\s-1CLDR\s0 provides a fairly complex system for localizing time zones that
we ignore entirely. The time zone patterns just use the information
provided by \f(CW\*(C`DateTime::TimeZone\*(C'\fR, and \fIdo not follow the \s-1CLDR\s0 spec\fR.
.PP
The output of a \s-1CLDR\s0 pattern is always localized, when applicable.
.PP
\&\s-1CLDR\s0 provides the following patterns:

\&\*(L"\-01234\*(R".

yy
.Sp
This is a special case. It always produces a two-digit year, so \*(L"1976\*(R" becomes

The \s-1CLDR\s0 data includes pre-defined formats for various patterns such as \*(L"month

\&\f(CW\*(C`DateTime\*(C'\fR implements Storable hooks in order to reduce the size of a
serialized \f(CW\*(C`DateTime\*(C'\fR object.
.SH "THE DATETIME PROJECT ECOSYSTEM"
.IX Header "THE DATETIME PROJECT ECOSYSTEM"
This module is part of a larger ecosystem of modules in the DateTime
family.
.SS "DateTime::Set"
.IX Subsection "DateTime::Set"
The DateTime::Set module represents sets (including recurrences) of
datetimes. Many modules return sets or recurrences.
.SS "Format Modules"
.IX Subsection "Format Modules"
The various format modules exist to parse and format datetimes. For example,
DateTime::Format::HTTP parses dates according to the \s-1RFC 1123\s0 format:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    my $datetime
\&        = DateTime::Format::HTTP\->parse_datetime(
\&        \*(AqThu Feb  3 17:03:55 GMT 1994\*(Aq);
\&
\&    print DateTime::Format::HTTP\->format_datetime($datetime);
.Ve
.PP
Most format modules are suitable for use as a \f(CW\*(C`formatter\*(C'\fR with a DateTime
object.
.PP
All format modules start with
DateTime::Format:: <https://metacpan.org/search?q=datetime%3A%3Aformat>.
.SS "Calendar Modules"
.IX Subsection "Calendar Modules"
There are a number of modules on \s-1CPAN\s0 that implement non-Gregorian calendars,
such as the Chinese, Mayan, and Julian calendars.
.PP
All calendar modules start with
DateTime::Calendar:: <https://metacpan.org/search?q=datetime%3A%3Acalendar>.
.SS "Event Modules"
.IX Subsection "Event Modules"
There are a number of modules that calculate the dates for events, such as
Easter, Sunrise, etc.
.PP
All event modules start with
DateTime::Event:: <https://metacpan.org/search?q=datetime%3A%3Aevent>.
.SS "Others"
.IX Subsection "Others"
There are many other modules that work with DateTime, including modules in the
DateTimeX namespace <https://metacpan.org/search?q=datetimex> namespace, as
well as others.
.PP
See MetaCPAN <https://metacpan.org/search?q=datetime> for more modules.
.SH "KNOWN BUGS"
.IX Header "KNOWN BUGS"
The tests in \fI20infinite.t\fR seem to fail on some machines,
particularly on Win32. This appears to be related to Perl's internal
handling of \s-1IEEE\s0 infinity and NaN, and seems to be highly
platform/compiler/phase of moon dependent.
.PP
If you don't plan to use infinite datetimes you can probably ignore
this. This will be fixed (perhaps) in future versions.
.SH "SEE ALSO"

.SH "DONATIONS"
.IX Header "DONATIONS"
If you'd like to thank me for the work I've done on this module, please
consider making a \*(L"donation\*(R" to me via PayPal. I spend a lot of free time
creating free software, and would appreciate any support you'd care to offer.
.PP
Please note that \fBI am not suggesting that you must do this\fR in order for me
to continue working on this particular software. I will continue to do so,
inasmuch as I have in the past, for as long as it interests me.
.PP
Similarly, a donation made in this way will probably not make me work on this
software much more, unless I get so many donations that I can consider working
on free software full time (let's all have a chuckle at that together).
.PP
To donate, log into PayPal and send money to autarch@urth.org, or use the
button at <https://www.urth.org/fs\-donation.html>.
