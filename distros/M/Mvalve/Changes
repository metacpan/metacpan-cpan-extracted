Changes
=======

0.00014 - 08 Sep 2008
  - Recent versions of Moose (properly) unimport blessed() and confess(), 
    which breaks my code depending on it.
  - Recent versions of MooseX::ClassAttribute (properly) makes class
    attributes /not/ able to be required, which breaks my code depending on it.
