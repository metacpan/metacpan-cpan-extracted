DESCRIPTION

    WWW::KrispyKreme::HotLight is a Perl wrapper for Krispy Kreme's
    location search page. This module will return an array ref of hash refs
    which contain info for all the Krispy Kreme stores near the given
    geolocation.

METHODS

 new

    Creates a new WWW::KrispyKreme::HotLight object. Currently the only
    REQUIRED option is 'where' and only supports geo

        my $donuts = WWW::KrispyKreme::HotLight->new(where => [34.170833,-118.25]);

 locations

    Returns an array ref of hash refs. Each hash ref represents a store
    near the given geolocation. The structure of one location entry should
    look like this:
