MSDOS::Descript version 1.05, released September 20, 2014


This module provides access to 4DOS style DESCRIPT.ION files.
It can both read and write them.



INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

	perl Build.PL
	./Build
	./Build test
	./Build install



DEPENDENCIES

  Package      Minimum Version
  ------------ ---------------
  perl          5.6.0
  Carp          
  Tie::CPHash   
  vars

    You must have the Tie::CPHash module (a case-insensitive hash).

    Additionally, you should have the MSDOS::Attrib module if it's
    supported on your system (it currently works on OS/2 and Win32
    systems).  If you don't have MSDOS::Attrib, then any DESCRIPT.ION
    files modified by MSDOS::Descript will no longer be hidden files.
    This means that they will show up in directory listings.

    Both these modules are available on CPAN:

        http://search.cpan.org/dist/Tie-CPHash/
        http://search.cpan.org/dist/MSDOS-Attrib/
