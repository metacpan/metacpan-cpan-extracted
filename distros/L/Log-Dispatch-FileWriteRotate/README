SYNOPSIS

     use Log::Dispatch::FileWriteRotate;
    
     my $file = Log::Dispatch::FileWriteRotate(
         min_level => 'info',
    
         # will be passed to File::Write::Rotate
         dir       => '/var/log',
         prefix    => 'myapp',
         suffix    => '.log',
         period    => 'monthly',
         size      => 25*1024*1024,
         histories => 12,
     );
    
     $file->log(level => 'info', message => "Your comment\n");

DESCRIPTION

    This module functions similarly to Log::Dispatch::FileRotate, but uses
    File::Write::Rotate as backend, thus interoperates more easily with
    other modules which use File::Write::Rotate as backend, e.g.
    Tie::Handle::FileWriteRotate or Process::Govern.

METHODS

 new(%args)

    Constructor. This method takes a hash of parameters. The following
    options are valid: min_level and max_level (see Log::Dispatch
    documentation); dir, prefix, suffix, period, size, and histories (see
    File::Write::Rotate).

 log_message(message => STR)

    Send a message to the appropriate output. Generally this shouldn't be
    called directly but should be called through the log() method (in
    LLog::Dispatch::Output>).
