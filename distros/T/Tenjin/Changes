0.070001  2011-03-29 21:38:04 Asia/Jerusalem
	- Added version numbers to all modules (not just Tenjin.pm) as the CPAN
	  indexer failed.

0.070     2011-03-29 21:31:14 Asia/Jerusalem
	- Tenjin now properly decodes template input and encodes template output
	  according to the user's selected encoding
	- Default encoding now spelled UTF-8 instead of utf8
	- Added t/encoding.t to test template encoding

0.062     2010-08-06 20:49:28 Asia/Jerusalem
	- Tenjin now croaks instead of dies, and only inside the context
	  class (the evaluate and to_func methods).
	- The _render internal method was removed as it's not needed anymore
	- Every template object now has the template's name, not just the
	  file name. This is good for non-file templates and allows croaking
	  with a message that gives more info about the location of the error.
	- Added a new test that simply attempts to catch a croak in an
	  intentionally "faulty" template.
	- Removed the Encode dependency from Tenjin::Util as it wasn't
	  even used.
	- Migrated distribution to use Dist::Zilla
