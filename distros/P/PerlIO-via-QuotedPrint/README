NAME

    PerlIO::via::QuotedPrint - PerlIO layer for quoted-printable strings

SYNOPSIS

    use PerlIO::via::QuotedPrint;

    open(my $in, '<:via(QuotedPrint)', 'file.qp') or
        die "Can't open file.qp for reading: $!\n";

    open(my $out, '>:via(QuotedPrint)', 'file.qp') or
        die "Can't open file.qp for writing: $!\n";

DESCRIPTION

    This module implements a PerlIO layer that works on files encoded in the
    quoted-printable format. It will decode from quoted-printable while reading
    from a handle, and it will encode as quoted-printable while writing to a
    handle.
