Ham::APRS::FAP
==============

FAP - Finnish APRS Parser (Fabulous APRS Parser)

This module is a fairly complete APRS parser implemented in pure Perl.
It parses normal, mic-e and compressed location packets, NMEA location
packets, objects, items, messages, telemetry and most weather packets. It is
stable and fast enough to parse the APRS-IS stream in real time.

Unless a debugging mode is enabled, all errors and warnings are reported
through the API (as opposed to printing on STDERR or STDOUT), so that
they can be reported nicely on the user interface of an application.
This parser is not known to crash on invalid packets. It is used to power
the http://aprs.fi/ web site.

APRS features specifically NOT handled by this module:
 - special objects (area, signpost, etc)
 - network tunneling/third party packets
 - direction finding
 - station capability queries
 - status reports (partially)
 - user defined data formats

This module is based (on those parts that are implemented)
on APRS specification 1.0.1.
