Changelog for Beam-Minion

0.006     2017-08-22 18:48:33-05:00 America/Chicago

    [Fixed]

    - Fixed issue with passing plain DBI DSNs: The backend expects
      a list of arguments, not an arrayref of arguments.

    - Moved log to STDERR. This is temporary until we can come up with
      some more robust logging configuration (probably Log::Any)

0.005     2017-08-19 21:42:31-05:00 America/Chicago

    [Fixed]

    - Fixed raw Minion args to allow passing plain DBI DSNs. This allows
      me to use the `mysql_read_defaults_file` DBD::mysql configuration.

0.004     2017-08-14 13:01:07-05:00 America/Chicago

    [Added]

    - Added `enqueue` Perl API to the Beam::Minion module. This makes it
      easier to add jobs via Perl instead of using the command-line (or
      the command class)

    [Fixed]

    - Fixed deprecated use of `slurp` from Mojolicious
    - Fixed some error messages to be easier to understand for the user

0.003     2017-04-28 01:26:54-05:00 America/Chicago

      error message

    [Added]

    - Added some basic getting started documentation in preparation for
      writing some tutorials
