Revision history for Ryu

4.000     2024-08-19 00:54:18+08:00 Asia/Singapore
    [New features]

    - Ryu::Source->emit_batch provides initial support for batches, for more efficient
    handling of larger volumes of data. Use `on_batch` to deal with the results.
    - Ryu::Source->as_void gives you an empty result, useful if you want to await
    without caring about the result
    - Ryu::Source->as_last allows you to wait for the last emitted value
    - Ryu::Sink->drain_from allow sequential processing of sources as inputs to a sink

    [Bugs fixed]

    - passing an arrayref to `$src->from` probably didn't work as expected before
    - some potential memory leaks addressed, particularly in source/sink interaction and for code using flow control (e.g. `$src->unblocked`)

3.005     2024-01-04 04:21:40+08:00 Asia/Singapore
    [Bugs fixed]

    - handle the `max_items` parameter to `->as_queue`

    [Dependencies]

    - update to latest Future::Queue to avoid deep-recursion scenario

3.004     2023-03-05 14:36:17+08:00 Asia/Singapore
    [New features]
    - Ryu::Source->as_queue allows `max_items` and will pause the stream while waiting for the queue to drain
    - flag a warning when someone tries to use `->completed->done/fail` directly, since that's not likely to work as expected

    [Bugs fixed]
    - extra single-use Futures were being created, which caused complaints from Future::XS since they were
    abandoned (the ->without_cancel calls in Ryu::Node)
    - chained nodes were still being called after completion, which would lead to some odd-looking debug messages
    from nodes such as `->take(5)`

3.003     2023-03-03 20:51:58+08:00 Asia/Singapore
    [New features]
    - Ryu::Observable now has a ->finish method

3.002     2021-07-07 17:48:25+08:00 Asia/Kuala_Lumpur
    [Bugs fixed]
    - in ->flat_map, any failure in the original or added Ryu::Source instances
    will now propagate as a failure for the ->flat_map source as well

3.001     2021-06-21 08:19:28+08:00 Asia/Kuala_Lumpur
    [New features]
    - Ryu::Observable has aliases for ->as_numeric, ->as_number and ->set_numeric, ->set_number
    - Sentinel support for Ryu::Observable via ->lvalue_str and ->lvalue_num

3.000     2021-05-01 19:58:23+08:00 Asia/Kuala_Lumpur
    [New features]
    - ->next support

    [Bugs fixed]
    - the ->completed and ->unblocked methods now return uncancellable Futures, so that
    they can be used with constructs such as Future->wait_any(timeout, $src->unblocked)
    without affecting internal state

2.009     2021-04-13 13:32:36+08:00 Asia/Kuala_Lumpur
    No new features.

    Bugs fixed:

    - ->unblocked could fail due to bypassing the default when attempting to use the Future factory

2.008     2021-04-05 12:20:04+08:00 Asia/Kuala_Lumpur
    New features:

    - ->emit_from joins multiple sources into the current source

2.007     2021-01-25 02:01:08+08:00 Asia/Kuala_Lumpur
    New features:

    - the `->source` provided by a Ryu::Sink is now a child of the sink itself,
    to facilitate backpressure algorithms and help with common streaming configurations

    Bugs fixed:

    - ->ordered_futures would call ->pause or ->resume more often than required,
    these are now only triggered when they would change state

2.006     2021-01-17 03:02:18+08:00 Asia/Kuala_Lumpur
    New features:

    - ->ordered_futures (->resolve) now also takes low/high parameters for backpressure

    Bugs fixed:

    - original source failure propagates after any pending Future instances are resolved,
    thanks to Amin Marashi (Github issue #8)

2.005     2021-01-17 02:16:18+08:00 Asia/Kuala_Lumpur
    New features:

    - ->as_buffer can take low/high parameters similar to ->buffer, providing backpressure
    for buffer streams.

    Bugs fixed:

    - small amount of extra protection on Ryu::Observable->notify_all, which was
    previously passing an alias to the internal value (so the notifier callback
    was able to modify this directly). Now receives a copy.

    Documentation updates:

    - Mojo::Rx no longer exists, replaced with RxPerl references

2.004     2020-12-03 00:38:42+08:00 Asia/Kuala_Lumpur
    No new features.

    Bugs fixed:

    - the `->from` method on a source was trying to call `blessed()` without importing
    it (thanks to KARJALA for raising this one)

2.003     2020-08-04 11:50:48+08:00 Asia/Kuala_Lumpur
    No new features.

    Bugs fixed:

    - memory leak when using ->ordered_futures, due to accumulation of callbacks for
    cancelling pending requests (thanks to Nael Alolwani for reporting and providing
    a test case)

2.002     2020-06-27 23:53:40+08:00 Asia/Kuala_Lumpur
    No new features.

    Documentation updates:

    - mention RxPerl and Future::Buffer
    - clearer link to Ryu::Source, since it's not always obvious
    where the real code can be found...

2.001     2020-06-09 01:35:39+08:00 Asia/Kuala_Lumpur
    New features:

    - basic ->read_packed support in Ryu::Buffer

2.000     2020-06-09 00:37:33+08:00 Asia/Kuala_Lumpur
    New features:

    - Ryu::Buffer was previously an empty class, should now be doing something useful
    - ->as_queue to get a Future::Queue instance from a Ryu::Source
    - ->as_buffer to get a Ryu::Buffer instance from a Ryu::Source

    Deprecations:

    - Ryu::Exception ->future is no longer supported, should be ->as_future instead

    Since there's a deprecated feature, this is a major version release.

1.012     2020-03-22 13:35:42+08:00 Asia/Kuala_Lumpur
    New features:

    - ->unblocked returns a Future which can be used to await a paused source/sink.

1.011     2020-01-07 11:24:46+08:00 Asia/Kuala_Lumpur
    No new features.

    Bugs fixed:

    - ->ordered_futures now cancels any pending Futures when the source fails.

1.010     2019-12-25 20:55:38+08:00 Asia/Kuala_Lumpur
    No new features.

    Bugs fixed:

    - ->take_until and ->skip_until may complete before the condition, handle that correctly
    - fully-qualify calls to Scalar::Util::refaddr to avoid runtime errors

1.009     2019-11-17 23:53:21+08:00 Asia/Kuala_Lumpur
    No new features.

    Dependencies:

    - minimum Future.pm version is now 0.42, due to a memory leak relating
    to cancellation in previous versions:
    https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=130957

1.008     2019-11-06 00:05:39+08:00 Asia/Kuala_Lumpur
    New features:

    - support ->on_failed on Ryu::Source

    Bugs fixed:

    - a Ryu::Sink could be completed before the Ryu::Source, avoid
    exceptions when the Ryu::Source subsequently completes and tries
    to mark the Future as done

1.007     2019-10-03 00:25:56+08:00 Asia/Kuala_Lumpur
    No new features.

    Bugs fixed:

    - ->ordered_futures was terminating too early due to previous changes, now
    only finishes after all items are complete.

1.006     2019-10-01 12:48:37+08:00 Asia/Kuala_Lumpur
    No new features.

    Bugs fixed:

    - ->with_index and some other methods were not completing when the parent
    was finished - thanks to Amin Marashi for reporting
    - lifetime handling for chained sources was simplified, ->each_while_source
    was supposed to attach handlers for the parent rather than the child source
    - dropped usage of namespace::clean

1.005     2019-05-05 19:15:56+08:00 Asia/Kuala_Lumpur
    No new features.

    Bugs fixed:

    - when there are no downstream nodes, the ->buffer node should accumulate
    data until something is attached, to support the common pattern of
    swapping out downstream nodes periodically (or when a threshold is reached)

1.004     2019-04-30 02:03:42+08:00 Asia/Kuala_Lumpur
    New features:

    - ->take_until method

1.003     2019-04-28 00:15:57+08:00 Asia/Kuala_Lumpur
    Documentation fixes:

    - Incorrect `C<>` block, thanks to MANWAR for reporting+submitting a
    [pull request for this](https://github.com/team-at-cpan/Ryu/pull/5).

    Dependencies:

    - minimum Perl version is now 5.18, as reported by SREZIC earlier
    versions get stuck on the test suite for some reason. This is quite
    likely to be a bug in the code, but legacy Perl support is not
    currently a priority (newer Perl versions have lots of useful bugfixes
    and improvements!).

1.002     2019-04-21 00:21:55+08:00 Asia/Kuala_Lumpur
    New features:

    - ->batch method for grouping items into arrayrefs

1.001     2019-04-15 05:44:47+08:00 Asia/Kuala_Lumpur
    New features:

    - sources populated from an immediate source (e.g. from an arrayref)
    will stream data via the `->{on_get}` callback the first time
    ->completed is called, since there's no guarantee we will be calling
    ->await on the top-level source.

    Bugs fixed:

    - ->buffer sources now only complete once the queue is drained.

1.000     2019-04-08 22:56:19+08:00 Asia/Kuala_Lumpur
    New features:

    - ->ignore method added: this throws away all its input

    Bugs fixed:

    - pause handling on sinks could previously report errors if nothing
    had called `->pause($src)` before the ->is_paused check

0.037     2019-03-25 17:42:43+08:00 Asia/Kuala_Lumpur
    No new features.

    Bugs fixed:

    - boolean comparison on Ryu::Observable instances caused a warning

0.036     2019-02-08 17:14:51+08:00 Asia/Kuala_Lumpur
    New features:
    
    - ->skip_until will filter out any items until the given condition
    is reached (either Future being true, or coderef returning true)

0.035     2019-01-02 01:37:38+08:00 Asia/Kuala_Lumpur
    No new features.

    Bugs fixed:

0.034     2019-01-02 00:19:29+08:00 Asia/Kuala_Lumpur
    Bugs fixed:

    - better support for sync chains: we now call the `->{on_get}` callback
    recursively if available.

    Developer updates:

    - moved from the old manual dist.ini content to a plugin bundle,
    hopefully this doesn't cause too much breakage

0.033     2018-12-21 15:35:22+08:00 Asia/Kuala_Lumpur
    Bugs fixed:

    - the ordered futures method ->resolve should not complete
    until all incoming entries are received and resolved

    New features:

    - ->buffer now supports high/low watermark
    - ->is_paused($obj) will check to see if the node is
    paused on request from $obj

    New features:

    - ->buffer method for collecting items while a source/sink
    are paused
    - ->retain method for keeping sources around

0.030     2018-12-13 20:58:38+08:00 Asia/Kuala_Lumpur
    New features:

    - flow control expanded and moved to the Ryu::Node
    parent class

    Bugs fixed:

    - resolved some edge cases where handlers can be
    added/removed during callback loops
    - the ->source inside a Ryu::Sink for handling events
    is now preserved when attaching an external source
    via ->from

0.029     2018-12-02 14:20:37+08:00 Asia/Kuala_Lumpur
    No new features.

    Bugs fixed:

    - ensure we retain sources when merging
    - allow merging with no parent source (Ryu::Source->merge)

0.028     2018-10-14 00:03:50+08:00 Asia/Kuala_Lumpur
    New features:

    - handle undef better in ->filter, and support arrayref as list
    of options (string match only so far, but this will eventually
    be a recursive match)

0.027     2018-01-02 00:52:31+08:00 Asia/Kuala_Lumpur
    New features:

    - ->hexdump, mainly intended for debugging protocol handling
    - ->map_from_source, allowing control over what is emitted (and
    when) compared to ->map

0.026     2017-12-28 01:11:07+08:00 Asia/Kuala_Lumpur
    No new features.

    Internal changes:
