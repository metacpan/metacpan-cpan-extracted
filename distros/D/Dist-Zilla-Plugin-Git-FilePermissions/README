NAME

    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Git::FilePermissions - fix the file permissions in
    your Git repository with Dist::Zilla

VERSION

    Version 1.000

SYNOPSIS

      # in dist.ini:
      [Git::FilePermissions]
      perms = ^bin/         0755
      perms = ^scripts/     0755

DESCRIPTION

    This plugin fixes the file permissions of all the files in the Git
    repository where your project is saved. Files not in the Git index, and
    directories, are ignored.

    Without configuration, every file is changed to the default permission
    of 0644. The default permissions can be changed with the default option
    and you can configure different permissions for some files with the
    perms option in the dist.ini.

    The plugin runs in the before build phase, which means it will fix the
    file permissions before the files are picked up in the file gather
    phase. The new permissions are therefore also the ones used in the
    build.

    The plugin should ensure that you always commit your files with the
    correct permissions.

 perms

    The perms configuration option takes the form of:

      perms = REGEX WHITESPACE PERMS

    or

      perms = REGEX WHITESPACE -

    The perms configuration options are processed in order for every file.
    If a file matches the REGEX the file permissions are changed to the
    corresponding PERMS instead of the default permissions of 0644. If the
    PERMS are - the file is ignored.
