;   It is always a good idea to anchor, using ORGs, important sections such as 
;   the character bitmaps so that they don't move as code is added and removed.

;   Generally most approaches try to maintain main entry points as they are
;   often used by third-party software.

;** Part 1. RESTART ROUTINES AND TABLES **
;*****************************************

; -----------
; THE 'START'
; -----------
;   At switch on, the Z80 chip is in Interrupt Mode 0.
;   The Spectrum uses Interrupt Mode 1.
;   This location can also be 'called' to reset the machine.
;   Typically with PRINT USR 0.

;; START

START:
        di                      ; Disable Interrupts.
        xor a                   ; Signal coming from START.
        ld de, $FFFF            ; Set pointer to top of possible physical RAM.
        jp START_NEW            ; Jump forward to common code at START-NEW.


; -------------------
; THE 'ERROR' RESTART
; -------------------
;   The error pointer is made to point to the position of the error to enable
;   the editor to highlight the error position if it occurred during syntax 
;   checking.  It is used at 37 places in the program.  An instruction fetch 
;   on address $0008 may page in a peripheral ROM such as the Sinclair 
;   Interface 1 or Disciple Disk Interface.  This was not an original design 
;   concept and not all errors pass through here.

;; ERROR-1

ERROR_1:
        ld hl, (CH_ADD)         ; Fetch the character address from CH_ADD.
        ld (X_PTR), hl          ; Copy it to the error pointer X_PTR.
        jr ERROR_2              ; Forward to continue at ERROR-2.


; -----------------------------
; THE 'PRINT CHARACTER' RESTART
; -----------------------------
;   The A register holds the code of the character that is to be sent to
;   the output stream of the current channel.  The alternate register set is 
;   used to output a character in the A register so there is no need to 
;   preserve any of the current main registers (HL, DE, BC).  
;   This restart is used 21 times.

;; PRINT-A

PRINT_A:
        jp PRINT_A_2            ; Jump forward to continue at PRINT-A-2.


; ---

        defb $FF, $FF, $FF, $FF, $FF
                                ; Five unused locations.

; -------------------------------
; THE 'COLLECT CHARACTER' RESTART
; -------------------------------
;   The contents of the location currently addressed by CH_ADD are fetched.
;   A return is made if the value represents a character that has
;   relevance to the BASIC parser. Otherwise CH_ADD is incremented and the
;   tests repeated. CH_ADD will be addressing somewhere -
;   1) in the BASIC program area during line execution.
;   2) in workspace if evaluating, for example, a string expression.
;   3) in the edit buffer if parsing a direct command or a new BASIC line.
;   4) in workspace if accepting input but not that from INPUT LINE.

;; GET-CHAR

GET_CHAR:
        ld hl, (CH_ADD)         ; fetch the address from CH_ADD.
        ld a, (hl)              ; use it to pick up current character.

;; TEST-CHAR

TEST_CHAR:
        call SKIP_OVER          ; routine SKIP-OVER tests if the character is
                                ; relevant.
        ret nc                  ; Return if it is significant.

; ------------------------------------
; THE 'COLLECT NEXT CHARACTER' RESTART
; ------------------------------------
;   As the BASIC commands and expressions are interpreted, this routine is
;   called repeatedly to step along the line.  It is used 83 times.

;; NEXT-CHAR

NEXT_CHAR:
        call CH_ADD_1           ; routine CH-ADD+1 fetches the next immediate
                                ; character.
        jr TEST_CHAR            ; jump back to TEST-CHAR until a valid
                                ; character is found.


; ---

        defb $FF, $FF, $FF      ; unused

; -----------------------
; THE 'CALCULATE' RESTART
; -----------------------
;   This restart enters the Spectrum's internal, floating-point, stack-based, 
;   FORTH-like language.
;   It is further used recursively from within the calculator.
;   It is used on 77 occasions.

;; FP-CALC

FP_CALC:
        jp CALCULATE            ; jump forward to the CALCULATE routine.


; ---

        defb $FF, $FF, $FF, $FF, $FF

                                ; little cramped, these same locations were
                                ; used for the five-byte end-calc literal.

; ------------------------------
; THE 'CREATE BC SPACES' RESTART
; ------------------------------
;   This restart is used on only 12 occasions to create BC spaces
;   between workspace and the calculator stack.

;; BC-SPACES

BC_SPACES:
        push bc                 ; Save number of spaces.
        ld hl, (WORKSP)         ; Fetch WORKSP.
        push hl                 ; Save address of workspace.
        jp RESERVE              ; Jump forward to continuation code RESERVE.


; --------------------------------
; THE 'MASKABLE INTERRUPT' ROUTINE
; --------------------------------
;   This routine increments the Spectrum's three-byte FRAMES counter fifty 
;   times a second (sixty times a second in the USA ).
;   Both this routine and the called KEYBOARD subroutine use the IY register 
;   to access system variables and flags so a user-written program must 
;   disable interrupts to make use of the IY register.

;; MASK-INT

MASK_INT:
        push af                 ; Save the registers that will be used but not
        push hl                 ; the IY register unfortunately.
        ld hl, (FRAMES)         ; Fetch the first two bytes at FRAMES1.
        inc hl                  ; Increment lowest two bytes of counter.
        ld (FRAMES), hl         ; Place back in FRAMES1.
        ld a, h                 ; Test if the result was zero.
        or l
        jr nz, KEY_INT          ; Forward, if not, to KEY-INT

        inc (iy+FRAMES3-IY0)    ; otherwise increment FRAMES3 the third byte.

;   Now save the rest of the main registers and read and decode the keyboard.

;; KEY-INT

KEY_INT:
        push bc                 ; Save the other main registers.
        push de

        call KEYBOARD           ; Routine KEYBOARD executes a stage in the
                                ; process of reading a key-press.
        pop de
        pop bc                  ; Restore registers.

        pop hl
        pop af

        ei                      ; Enable Interrupts.
        ret                     ; Return.


; ---------------------
; THE 'ERROR-2' ROUTINE
; ---------------------
;   A continuation of the code at 0008.
;   The error code is stored and after clearing down stacks, an indirect jump 
;   is made to MAIN-4, etc. to handle the error.

;; ERROR-2

; ------------------------------------
; THE 'NON-MASKABLE INTERRUPT' ROUTINE
; ------------------------------------
;   
;   There is no NMI switch on the standard Spectrum or its peripherals.
;   When the NMI line is held low, then no matter what the Z80 was doing at 
;   the time, it will now execute the code at 66 Hex.
;   This Interrupt Service Routine will jump to location zero if the contents 
;   of the system variable NMIADD are zero or return if the location holds a
;   non-zero address.   So attaching a simple switch to the NMI as in the book 
;   "Spectrum Hardware Manual" causes a reset.  The logic was obviously 
;   intended to work the other way.  Sinclair Research said that, since they
;   had never advertised the NMI, they had no plans to fix the error "until 
;   the opportunity arose".
;   
;   Note. The location NMIADD was, in fact, later used by Sinclair Research 
;   to enhance the text channel on the ZX Interface 1.
;   On later Amstrad-made Spectrums, and the Brazilian Spectrum, the logic of 
;   this routine was indeed reversed but not as at first intended.
;
;   It can be deduced by looking elsewhere in this ROM that the NMIADD system
;   variable pointed to L121C and that this enabled a Warm Restart to be 
;   performed at any time, even while playing machine code games, or while 
;   another Spectrum has been allowed to gain control of this one. 
;
;   Software houses would have been able to protect their games from attack by
;   placing two zeros in the NMIADD system variable.

;; RESET

RESET:
        push af                 ; save the
        push hl                 ; registers.
        ld hl, (NMIADD)         ; fetch the system variable NMIADD.
        ld a, h                 ; test address
        or l                    ; for zero.

        retn                    ; return to previous interrupt state.


; ---------------------------
; THE 'CH ADD + 1' SUBROUTINE
; ---------------------------
;   This subroutine is called from RST 20, and three times from elsewhere
;   to fetch the next immediate character following the current valid character
;   address and update the associated system variable.
;   The entry point TEMP-PTR1 is used from the SCANNING routine.
;   Both TEMP-PTR1 and TEMP-PTR2 are used by the READ command routine.

;; CH-ADD+1

CH_ADD_1:
        ld hl, (CH_ADD)         ; fetch address from CH_ADD.

;; TEMP-PTR1

TEMP_PTR1:
        inc hl                  ; increase the character address by one.

;; TEMP-PTR2

TEMP_PTR2:
        ld (CH_ADD), hl         ; update CH_ADD with character address.


X007B:
        ld a, (hl)              ; load character to A from HL.
        ret                     ; and return.


; --------------------------
; THE 'SKIP OVER' SUBROUTINE
; --------------------------
;   This subroutine is called once from RST 18 to skip over white-space and
;   other characters irrelevant to the parsing of a BASIC line etc. .
;   Initially the A register holds the character to be considered
;   and HL holds its address which will not be within quoted text
;   when a BASIC line is parsed.
;   Although the 'tab' and 'at' characters will not appear in a BASIC line,
;   they could be present in a string expression, and in other situations.
;   Note. although white-space is usually placed in a program to indent loops
;   and make it more readable, it can also be used for the opposite effect and
;   spaces may appear in variable names although the parser never sees them.
;   It is this routine that helps make the variables 'Anum bEr5 3BUS' and
;   'a number 53 bus' appear the same to the parser.

; THE 'KEY' TABLES
; ----------------
;   These six look-up tables are used by the keyboard reading routine
;   to decode the key values.
;
;   The first table contains the maps for the 39 keys of the standard
;   40-key Spectrum keyboard. The remaining key [SHIFT $27] is read directly.
;   The keys consist of the 26 upper-case alphabetic characters, the 10 digit
;   keys and the space, ENTER and symbol shift key.
;   Unshifted alphabetic keys have $20 added to the value.
;   The keywords for the main alphabetic keys are obtained by adding $A5 to
;   the values obtained from this table.

;   rotated left to work up the left hand side and then down the right
;   hand side of the keyboard. When the reset bit drops into the carry
;   then all 8 half-rows have been read. Shift is the first key to be

;**********************************

; Documented by Alvin Albrecht.

; ------------------------------
; Routine to control loudspeaker
; ------------------------------
; Outputs a square wave of given duration and frequency
; to the loudspeaker.
;   Enter with: DE = #cycles - 1
;               HL = tone period as described next
;
; The tone period is measured in T states and consists of
; three parts: a coarse part (H register), a medium part
; (bits 7..2 of L) and a fine part (bits 1..0 of L) which
; contribute to the waveform timing as follows:
;
;                          coarse    medium       fine
; duration of low  = 118 + 1024*H + 16*(L>>2) + 4*(L&0x3)
; duration of hi   = 118 + 1024*H + 16*(L>>2) + 4*(L&0x3)
; Tp = tone period = 236 + 2048*H + 32*(L>>2) + 8*(L&0x3)
;                  = 236 + 2048*H + 8*L = 236 + 8*HL
;
; As an example, to output five seconds of middle C (261.624 Hz):
;   (a) Tone period = 1/261.624 = 3.822ms
;   (b) Tone period in T-States = 3.822ms*fCPU = 13378
;         where fCPU = clock frequency of the CPU = 3.5MHz
;      Find H and L for desired tone period:
;         HL = (Tp - 236) / 8 = (13378 - 236) / 8 = 1643 = 0x066B
;   (d) Tone duration in cycles = 5s/3.822ms = 1308 cycles
;         DE = 1308 - 1 = 0x051B
;
; The resulting waveform has a duty ratio of exactly 50%.

;   An edge is a transition from one mic state to another.
;   More specifically a change in bit 6 of value input from port $FE.
;   Graphically it is a change of border colour, say, blue to yellow.
;   The first entry point looks for two adjacent edges. The second entry point
;   is used to find a single edge.
;   The B register holds a count, up to 256, within which the edge (or edges) 
;   must be found. The gap between two edges will be more for a '1' than a '0'
;   so the value of B denotes the state of the bit (two edges) read from tape.

; --------------------------
;   This moves the print position to the right leaving a trail in the

;   "However the programmer has failed to store the new print position
;   so CHR$ 9 will only work if the next print position is at a newly
;   defined place.
;   e.g. PRINT PAPER 2; CHR$ 9; AT 4,0;
;   does work but is not very helpful"

; THE 'POSITION FETCH' ROUTINE
; ----------------------------
;   This routine fetches the line/column and display file address of the upper 
;   and lower screen or, if the printer is in use, the column position and 
;   absolute memory address.
;   Note. that PR-CC-hi (23681) is used by this routine and if, in accordance 
;   with the manual (that says this is unused), the location has been used for 
;   other purposes, then subsequent output to the printer buffer could corrupt 
;   a 256-byte section of memory.

; THE 'NEW' COMMAND
; -----------------
;   The NEW command is about to set all RAM below RAMTOP to zero and then
;   re-initialize the system.  All RAM above RAMTOP should, and will be,
;   preserved.
;   There is nowhere to store values in RAM or on the stack which becomes
;   inoperable. Similarly PUSH and CALL instructions cannot be used to store
;   values or section common code. The alternate register set is the only place
;   available to store 3 persistent 16-bit system variables.

;; NEW

NEW:
        di                      ; Disable Interrupts - machine stack will be
                                ; cleared.
        ld a, $FF               ; Flag coming from NEW.
        ld de, (RAMTOP)         ; Fetch RAMTOP as top value.
        exx                     ; Switch in alternate set.
        ld bc, (P_RAMT)         ; Fetch P-RAMT differs on 16K/48K machines.
        ld de, (RASP)           ; Fetch RASP/PIP.
        ld hl, (UDG)            ; Fetch UDG    differs on 16K/48K machines.

; ----------------------
; THE 'START-NEW' BRANCH     
; ----------------------
;   This branch is taken from above and from RST 00h.
;   The common code tests RAM and sets it to zero re-initializing all the 
;   non-zero system variables and channel information.  The A register flags 
;   if coming from START or NEW.

;   This routine fetches the address of the input stream from the current 
;   channel area using the system variable CURCHL.

;; INPUT-AD

INPUT_AD:
        exx                     ; switch in alternate set.
        push hl                 ; save HL register

; THE 'CODE OUTPUT' ROUTINE
; -------------------------
;   This routine is called on five occasions to print the ASCII equivalent of 
;   a value 0-9.

;; OUT-CODE

; -------------------------
; THE 'MAIN OUTPUT' ROUTINE
; -------------------------
;   PRINT-A-2 is a continuation of the RST 10 restart that prints any character.
;   The routine prints to the current channel and the printing of control codes
;   may alter that channel to divert subsequent RST 10 instructions to temporary
;   routines. The normal channel is $09F4.

; The Channel and Streams Routines
; --------------------------------
; A channel is an input/output route to a hardware device
; and is identified to the system by a single letter e.g. 'K' for
; the keyboard. A channel can have an input and output route
; associated with it in which case it is bi-directional like
; the keyboard. Others like the upper screen 'S' are output
; only and the input routine usually points to a report message.
; Channels 'K' and 'S' are system channels and it would be inappropriate
; to close the associated streams so a mechanism is provided to
; re-attach them. When the re-attachment is no longer required, then
; closing these streams resets them as at initialization.
; Early adverts said that the network and RS232 were in this ROM. 
; Channels 'N' and 'B' are user channels and have been removed successfully 
; if, as seems possible, they existed.
; Ironically the tape streamer is not accessed through streams and
; channels.
; Early demonstrations of the Spectrum showed a single microdrive being
; controlled by the main ROM.

; ---------------------
; THE 'CLOSE #' COMMAND
; ---------------------
;   This command allows streams to be closed after use.
;   Any temporary memory areas used by the stream would be reclaimed and
;   finally flags set or reset if necessary.

; THE 'CLOSE-2' SUBROUTINE
; ------------------------
;   There is not much point in coming here.
;   The purpose was once to find the offset to a special closing routine,
;   in this ROM and within 256 bytes of the close stream look up table that
;   would reclaim any buffers associated with a stream. At least one has been
;   removed.
;   Any attempt to CLOSE streams $00 to $04, without first opening the stream,
;   will lead to either a system restart or the production of a strange report.

; The Stream Opening Routines.
; ----------------------------
; These routines would have opened any buffers associated with the stream
; before jumping forward to OPEN-END with the displacement value in E
; and perhaps a modified value in BC. The strange pathing does seem to
; provide for flexibility in this respect.
;
; There is no need to open the printer buffer as it is there already
; even if you are still saving up for a ZX Printer or have moved onto
; something bigger. In any case it would have to be created after
; the system variables but apart from that it is a simple task
; and all but one of the ROM routines can handle a buffer in that position.
; (PR-ALL-6 would require an extra 3 bytes of code).
; However it wouldn't be wise to have two streams attached to the ZX Printer
; as you can now, so one assumes that if PR_CC_hi was non-zero then
; the OPEN-P routine would have refused to attach a stream if another
; stream was attached.

; Something of significance is being passed to these ghost routines in the
; second character. Strings 'RB', 'RT' perhaps or a drive/station number.
; The routine would have to deal with that and exit to OPEN_END with BC
; containing $0001 or more likely there would be an exit within the routine.
; Anyway doesn't matter, these routines are long gone.

; These just generate an error report as the ROM is 'incomplete'.
;
; Luckily this provides a mechanism for extending these in a shadow ROM
; but without the powerful mechanisms set up in this ROM.
; An instruction fetch on $0008 may page in a peripheral ROM,
; e.g. the Sinclair Interface 1 ROM, to handle these commands.
; However that wasn't the plan.
; Development of this ROM continued for another three months until the cost
; of replacing it and the manual became unfeasible.
; The ultimate power of channels and streams died at birth.

; -------------------------------
; The parameter or "Syntax" table
; -------------------------------
; For each command there exists a variable list of parameters.
; If the character is greater than a space it is a required separator.
; If less, then it is a command class in the range 00 - 0B.
; Note that classes 00, 03 and 05 will fetch the addresses from this table.
; Some classes e.g. 07 and 0B have the same address in all invocations
; and the command is re-computed from the low-byte of the parameter address.
; Some e.g. 02 are only called once so a call to the command is made from
; within the class routine rather than holding the address within the table.
; Some class routines check syntax entirely and some leave this task for the
; command itself.
; Others for example CIRCLE (x,y,z) check the first part (x,y) using the
; class routine and the final part (,z) within the command.
; The last few commands appear to have been added in a rush but their syntax
; is rather simple e.g. MOVE "M1","M2"

; A General Note on Invalid Line Numbers.
; =======================================
; One of the revolutionary concepts of Sinclair BASIC was that it supported
; virtual line numbers. That is the destination of a GO TO, RESTORE etc. need
; not exist. It could be a point before or after an actual line number.
; Zero suffices for a before but the after should logically be infinity.
; Since the maximum actual line limit is 9999 then the system limit, 16383
; when variables kick in, would serve fine as a virtual end point.
; However, ironically, only the LOAD command gets it right. It will not
; autostart a program that has been saved with a line higher than 16383.
; All the other commands deal with the limit unsatisfactorily.
; LIST, RUN, GO TO, GO SUB and RESTORE have problems and the latter may
; crash the machine when supplied with an inappropriate virtual line number.
; This is puzzling as very careful consideration must have been given to
; this point when the new variable types were allocated their masks and also
; when the routine NEXT-ONE was successfully re-written to reflect this.
; An enigma.
; -------------------------------------------------------------------------

; ----------------------
; Handle RESTORE command
; ----------------------
; The restore command sets the system variable for the data address to
; point to the location before the supplied line number or first line
; thereafter.
; This alters the position where subsequent READ commands look for data.
; Note. If supplied with inappropriate high numbers the system may crash
; in the LINE-ADDR routine as it will pass the program/variables end-marker
; and then lose control of what it is looking for - variable or line number.
; - observation, Steven Vickers, 1984, Pitman.

; It is at STMT-RET that the actual change in control takes place.
; Unlike some BASICs the line number need not exist.
; Note. the high byte of the line number is incorrectly compared with $F0
; instead of $3F. This leads to commands with operands greater than 32767
; being considered as having been run from the editing area and the
; error report 'Statement Lost' is given instead of 'OK'.

; Colour Item Routines
; --------------------
;
; These routines have 3 entry points -
; 1) CO-TEMP-2 to handle a series of embedded Graphic colour items.
; 2) CO-TEMP-3 to handle a single embedded print colour item.
; 3) CO TEMP-4 to handle a colour command such as FLASH 1
;
; "Due to a bug, if you bring in a peripheral channel and later use a colour
;  statement, colour controls will be sent to it by mistake." - Steven Vickers
;  Pitman Pocket Guide, 1984.
;
; To be fair, this only applies if the last channel was other than 'K', 'S'
; or 'P', which are all that are supported by this ROM, but if that last
; channel was a microdrive file, network channel etc. then
; PAPER 6; CLS will not turn the screen yellow and
; CIRCLE INK 2; 128,88,50 will not draw a red circle.
;
; This bug does not apply to embedded PRINT items as it is quite permissible
; to mix stream altering commands and colour items.
; The fix therefore would be to ensure that CLASS-07 and CLASS-09 make
; channel 'S' the current channel when not checking syntax.

; THE 'CIRCLE' COMMAND
; --------------------
;   "Goe not Thou about to Square eyther circle" -
;   - John Donne, Cambridge educated theologian, 1624
;
;   The CIRCLE command draws a circle as a series of straight lines.
;   In some ways it can be regarded as a polygon, but the first line is drawn 
;   as a tangent, taking the radius as its distance from the centre.
;
;   Both the CIRCLE algorithm and the ARC drawing algorithm make use of the
;   'ROTATION FORMULA' (see later).  It is only necessary to work out where 
;   the first line will be drawn and how long it is and then the rotation 
;   formula takes over and calculates all other rotated points.
;
;   All Spectrum circles consist of two vertical lines at each side and two 
;   horizontal lines at the top and bottom. The number of lines is calculated
;   from the radius of the circle and is always divisible by 4. For complete 
;   circles it will range from 4 for a square circle to 32 for a circle of 
;   radius 87. The Spectrum can attempt larger circles e.g. CIRCLE 0,14,255
;   but these will error as they go off-screen after four lines are drawn.
;   At the opposite end, CIRCLE 128,88,1.23 will draw a circle as a perfect 3x3
;   square using 4 straight lines although very small circles are just drawn as 
;   a dot on the screen.
;
;   The first chord drawn is the vertical chord on the right of the circle.
;   The starting point is at the base of this chord which is drawn upwards and
;   the circle continues in an anti-clockwise direction. As noted earlier the 
;   x-coordinate of this point measured from the centre of the circle is the 
;   radius. 
;
;   The CIRCLE command makes extensive use of the calculator and as part of
;   process of drawing a large circle, free memory is checked 1315 times.
;   When drawing a large arc, free memory is checked 928 times.
;   A single call to 'sin' involves 63 memory checks and so values of sine 
;   and cosine are pre-calculated and held in the mem locations. As a 
;   clever trick 'cos' is derived from 'sin' using simple arithmetic operations
;   instead of the more expensive 'cos' function.
;
;   Initially, the syntax has been partly checked using the class for the DRAW 
;   command which stacks the origin of the circle (X,Y).

;   Note. the jump to DRW-STEPS is just to decrement B and jump into the 
;   middle of the arc-drawing loop. The arc count which includes the first 
;   vertical arc draws one less than the perceived number of arcs. 
;   The final arc offsets are obtained by subtracting the final COORDS value
;   from the initial sx and sy values which are kept at the base of the
;   calculator stack throughout the arc loop. 
;   This ensures that the final line finishes exactly at the starting pixel 
;   removing the possibility of any inaccuracy.
;   Since the initial sx and sy values are not required until the final arc
;   is drawn, they are not shown until then.
;   As the calculator stack is quite busy, only the active parts are shown in 
;   each section.


; ------------------
; THE 'DRAW' COMMAND
; ------------------
;   The Spectrum's DRAW command is overloaded and can take two parameters sets.
;
;   With two parameters, it simply draws an approximation to a straight line
;   at offset x,y using the LINE-DRAW routine.
;
;   With three parameters, an arc is drawn to the point at offset x,y turning 
;   through an angle, in radians, supplied by the third parameter.
;   The arc will consist of 4 to 252 straight lines each one of which is drawn 
;   by calls to the DRAW-LINE routine.

;   the jump will always be made to ARC-START.

; THE 'ARC LOOP'
; --------------
;
;   The arc drawing loop will draw up to 31 straight lines for a circle and up 
;   251 straight lines for an arc between two points. In both cases the final
;   closing straight line is drawn at ARC_END, but it otherwise loops back to 
;   here to calculate the next coordinate using the ROTATION FORMULA where (a)
;   is the previously calculated, constant CENTRAL ANGLE of the arcs.
;
;       Xrotated = x * cos(a) - y * sin(a)
;       Yrotated = x * sin(a) + y * cos(a)
;
;   The values cos(a) and sin(a) are pre-calculated and held in mem-3 and mem-4 
;   for the duration of the routine.
;   Memory location mem-1 holds the last relative x value (rx) and mem-2 holds
;   the last relative y value (ry) used by DRAW.
;
;   Note. that this is a very clever twist on what is after all a very clever,
;   well-used formula.  Normally the rotation formula is used with the x and y
;   coordinates from the centre of the circle (or arc) and a supplied angle to 
;   produce two new x and y coordinates in an anticlockwise direction on the 
;   circumference of the circle.
;   What is being used here, instead, is the relative X and Y parameters from
;   the last point plotted that are required to get to the current point and 
;   the formula returns the next relative coordinates to use.

;   The figure shows a right triangle that inscribes a circle of radius 1 with
;   centre, or origin, D.  Line BC is the diameter of length 2 and A is a point 
;   on the circle. The periphery angle BAC is therefore a right angle by the 
;   Rule of Thales.
;   Line AC is a chord touching two points on the circle and the angle at the 
;   centre is (a).
;   Since the vertex of the largest triangle B touches the circle, the 
;   inscribed angle (a/2) is half the central angle (a).
;   The cosine of (a) is the length DE as the hypotenuse is of length 1.
;   This can also be expressed as 1-length CE.  Examining the triangle at the
;   right, the top angle is also (a/2) as angle BAE and EBA add to give a right
;   angle as do BAE and EAC.
;   So cos (a) = 1 - AC * sin(a/2) 
;   Looking at the largest triangle, side AC can be expressed as 
;   AC = 2 * sin(a/2)   and so combining these we get 
;   cos (a) = 1 - 2 * sin(a/2) * sin(a/2).

;    not claim the discovery as your own, but will say it is mine."

;** Part 8. EXPRESSION EVALUATION **
;***********************************
;
; It is a this stage of the ROM that the Spectrum ceases altogether to be
; just a colourful novelty. One remarkable feature is that in all previous
; commands when the Spectrum is expecting a number or a string then an
; expression of the same type can be substituted ad infinitum.
; This is the routine that evaluates that expression.
; This is what causes 2 + 2 to give the answer 4.
; That is quite easy to understand. However you don't have to make it much
; more complex to start a remarkable juggling act.
; e.g. PRINT 2 * (VAL "2+2" + TAN 3)
; In fact, provided there is enough free RAM, the Spectrum can evaluate
; an expression of unlimited complexity.
; Apart from a couple of minor glitches, which you can now correct, the
; system is remarkably robust.

; ----------------
; This function returns the code of a bit-mapped character at screen
; position at line C, column B. It is unable to detect the mosaic characters
; which are not bit-mapped but detects the ASCII 32 - 127 range.
; The bit-mapped UDGs are ignored which is curious as it requires only a
; few extra bytes of code. As usual, anything to do with CHARS is weird.
; If no match is found a null string is returned.
; No actual check on ranges is performed - that's up to the BASIC programmer.
; No real harm can come from SCREEN$(255,255) although the BASIC manual
; says that invalid values will be trapped.
; Interestingly, in the Pitman pocket guide, 1984, Vickers says that the
; range checking will be performed.

;   RANDOM THEORY from the ZX81 manual by Steven Vickers
;
;   (same algorithm as the ZX Spectrum).
; 
;   Chapter 5. Exercise 6. (For mathematicians only.)
;
;   Let p be a [large] prime, & let a be a primitive root modulo p.
;   Then if b_i is the residue of a^i modulo p (1<=b_i<p-1), the 
;   sequence             
;   
;                           (b_i-1)/(p-1)
;               
;   is a cyclical sequence of p-1 distinct numbers in the range 0 to 1
;   (excluding 1). By choosing a suitably, these can be made to look 
;   fairly random.
;
;     65537 is a Mersenne prime 2^16-1. Note.
;
;   Use this, & Gauss' law of quadratic reciprocity, to show that 75 
;   is a primitive root modulo 65537.
;
;     The ZX81 uses p=65537 & a=75, & stores some b_i-1 in memory. 
;   The function RND involves replacing b_i-1 in memory by b_(i+1)-1, 
;   & yielding the result (b_(i+1)-1)/(p-1). RAND n (with 1<=n<=65535)
;   makes b_i equal to n+1.
;
; --------------------------------------------------------------------
;
; Steven Vickers writing in comp.sys.sinclair on 20-DEC-1993
; 
;   Note. (Of course, 65537 is 2^16 + 1, not -1.)
;
;   Consider arithmetic modulo a prime p. There are p residue classes, and the
;   non-zero ones are all invertible. Hence under multiplication they form a
;   group (Fp*, say) of order p-1; moreover (and not so obvious) Fp* is cyclic.
;   Its generators are the "primitive roots". The "quadratic residues modulo p"
;   are the squares in Fp*, and the "Legendre symbol" (d/p) is defined (when p
;   does not divide d) as +1 or -1, according as d is or is not a quadratic
;   residue mod p.
;
;   In the case when p = 65537, we can show that d is a primitive root if and
;   only if it's not a quadratic residue. For let w be a primitive root, d
;   congruent to w^r (mod p). If d is not primitive, then its order is a proper
;   factor of 65536: hence w^{32768*r} = 1 (mod p), so 65536 divides 32768*r,
;   and hence r is even and d is a square (mod p). Conversely, the squares in
;   Fp* form a subgroup of (Fp*)^2 of index 2, and so cannot be generators.
;
;   Hence to check whether 75 is primitive mod 65537, we want to calculate that
;   (75/65537) = -1. There is a multiplicative formula (ab/p) = (a/p)(b/p) (mod
;   p), so (75/65537) = (5/65537)^2 * (3/65537) = (3/65537). Now the law of
;   quadratic reciprocity says that if p and q are distinct odd primes, then
;
;    (p/q)(q/p) = (-1)^{(p-1)(q-1)/4}
;
;   Hence (3/65537) = (65537/3) * (-1)^{65536*2/4} = (65537/3)
;            = (2/3)  (because 65537 = 2 mod 3)
;            = -1
;
;   (I referred to Pierre Samuel's "Algebraic Theory of Numbers".)

; Scanning function (FN)
; ----------------------
; This routine deals with user-defined functions.
; The definition can be anywhere in the program area but these are best
; placed near the start of the program as we shall see.
; The evaluation process is quite complex as the Spectrum has to parse two
; statements at the same time. Syntax of both has been checked previously
; and hidden locations have been created immediately after each argument
; of the DEF FN statement. Each of the arguments of the FN function is
; evaluated by SCANNING and placed in the hidden locations. Then the
; expression to the right of the DEF FN '=' is evaluated by SCANNING and for
; any variables encountered, a search is made in the DEF FN variable list
; in the program area before searching in the normal variables area.
;
; Recursion is not allowed: i.e. the definition of a function should not use
; the same function, either directly or indirectly ( through another function).
; You'll normally get error 4, ('Out of memory'), although sometimes the system
; will crash. - Vickers, Pitman 1984.
;
; As the definition is just an expression, there would seem to be no means
; of breaking out of such recursion.
; However, by the clever use of string expressions and VAL, such recursion is
; possible.
; e.g. DEF FN a(n) = VAL "n+FN a(n-1)+0" ((n<1) * 10 + 1 TO )
; will evaluate the full 11-character expression for all values where n is
; greater than zero but just the 11th character, "0", when n drops to zero
; thereby ending the recursion producing the correct result.
; Recursive string functions are possible using VAL$ instead of VAL and the
; null string as the final addend.

; Used to parse DEF FN
; --------------------
; e.g. DEF FN     s $ ( x )     =  b     $ (  TO  x  ) : REM exaggerated
;
; This routine is used 10 times to advance along a DEF FN statement
; skipping spaces and colour control codes. It is similar to NEXT-CHAR
; which is, at the same time, used to skip along the corresponding FN function
; except the latter has to deal with AT and TAB characters in string
; expressions. These cannot occur in a program area so this routine is
; simpler as both colour controls and their parameters are less than space.

; It is called from SCANNING to isolate the required part of the structure.

;
; If checking syntax,
; the B register, which counts dimensions is set to zero (256) to allow
; the loop to continue till all subscripts are checked. While doing this it
; is reading dimension sizes from some arbitrary area of memory. Although
; these are meaningless it is of no concern as the limit is never checked by
; int-exp during syntax checking.
;
; The routine is also called from the syntax path of DIM command to check the
; syntax of both string and numeric arrays definitions except that bit 6 of C
; is reset so both are checked as numeric arrays. This ruse avoids a terminal
; slice being accepted as part of the DIM command.
; All that is being checked is that there are a valid set of comma-separated
; expressions before a terminal ')', although, as above, it will still go

; -------------------------
; Handle slicing of strings
; -------------------------
; The syntax of string slicing is very natural and it is as well to reflect
; on the permutations possible.
; a$() and a$( TO ) indicate the entire string although just a$ would do
; and would avoid coming here.
; h$(16) indicates the single character at position 16.
; a$( TO 32) indicates the first 32 characters.
; a$(257 TO) indicates all except the first 256 characters.
; a$(19000 TO 19999) indicates the thousand characters at position 19000.
; Also a$(9 TO 5) returns a null string not an error.
; This enables a$(2 TO) to return a null string if the passed string is
; of length zero or 1.
; A string expression in brackets can be sliced. e.g. (STR$ PI) (3 TO )
; We arrived here from SCANNING with CH-ADD pointing to the initial '('
; or from above.

; Storage of numbers in 5 byte form.
; ==================================
; Both integers and floating-point numbers can be stored in five bytes.
; Zero is a special case stored as 5 zeros.
; For integers the form is
; Byte 1 - zero,
; Byte 2 - sign byte, $00 +ve, $FF -ve.
; Byte 3 - Low byte of integer.
; Byte 4 - High byte
; Byte 5 - unused but always zero.
;
; it seems unusual to store the low byte first but it is just as easy either
; way. Statistically it just increases the chances of trailing zeros which
; is an advantage elsewhere in saving ROM code.
;
;             zero     sign     low      high    unused
; So +1 is  00000000 00000000 00000001 00000000 00000000
;
; and -1 is 00000000 11111111 11111111 11111111 00000000
;
; much of the arithmetic found in BASIC lines can be done using numbers
; in this form using the Z80's 16 bit register operation ADD.
; (multiplication is done by a sequence of additions).
;
; Storing -ve integers in two's complement form, means that they are ready for
; addition and you might like to add the numbers above to prove that the
; answer is zero. If, as in this case, the carry is set then that denotes that
; the result is positive. This only applies when the signs don't match.
; With positive numbers a carry denotes the result is out of integer range.
; With negative numbers a carry denotes the result is within range.
; The exception to the last rule is when the result is -65536
;
; Floating point form is an alternative method of storing numbers which can
; be used for integers and larger (or fractional) numbers.
;
; In this form 1 is stored as
;           10000001 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000
;
; When a small integer is converted to a floating point number the last two
; bytes are always blank so they are omitted in the following steps
;
; first make exponent +1 +16d  (bit 7 of the exponent is set if positive)

; 10010001 00000000 00000001
; 10010000 00000000 00000010 <-  now shift left and decrement exponent
; ...
; 10000010 01000000 00000000 <-  until a 1 abuts the imaginary point
; 10000001 10000000 00000000     to the left of the mantissa.
;
; however since the leftmost bit of the mantissa is always set then it can
; be used to denote the sign of the mantissa and put back when needed by the
; PREP routines which gives

; ------------------------------
; (offset: $86 'series-06')
; (offset: $88 'series-08')
; (offset: $8C 'series-0C')
;   The Spectrum uses Chebyshev polynomials to generate approximations for

;   Pafnuty Chebyshev, born in 1821, who did much pioneering work on numerical
;   series.  As far as calculators are concerned, Chebyshev polynomials have an
;   advantage over other series, for example the Taylor series, as they can
;   reach an approximation in just six iterations for SIN, eight for EXP and
;   twelve for LN and ATN.  The mechanics of the routine are interesting but
;   for full treatment of how these are generated with demonstrations in
;   Sinclair BASIC see "The Complete Spectrum ROM Disassembly" by Dr Ian Logan
;   and Dr Frank O'Hara, published 1983 by Melbourne House.

;   True binary operations.
;   A single entry point is used to evaluate six numeric and six string
;   comparisons. On entry, the calculator literal is in the B register and
;   the two numeric values, or the two string parameters, are on the 
;   calculator stack.
;   The individual bits of the literal are manipulated to group similar
;   operations although the SUB 8 instruction does nothing useful and merely
;   alters the string test bit.
;   Numbers are compared by subtracting one from the other, strings are 
;   compared by comparing every character until a mismatch, or the end of one
;   or both, is reached.
;
;   Numeric Comparisons.
;   --------------------
;   The 'x>y' example is the easiest as it employs straight-thru logic.
;   Number y is subtracted from x and the result tested for greater-0 yielding
;   a final value 1 (true) or 0 (false). 
;   For 'x<y' the same logic is used but the two values are first swapped on the
;   calculator stack. 
;   For 'x=y' NOT is applied to the subtraction result yielding true if the
;   difference was zero and false with anything else. 
;   The first three numeric comparisons are just the opposite of the last three
;   so the same processing steps are used and then a final NOT is applied.

;
;   String comparisons are a little different in that the eql/neql carry flag
;   from the 2nd RRCA is, as before, fed into the first of the end tests but
;   along the way it gets modified by the comparison process. The result on the
;   stack always starts off as zero and the carry fed in determines if NOT is 
;   applied to it. So the only time the greater-0 test is applied is if the
;   stack holds zero which is not very efficient as the test will always yield
;   zero. The most likely explanation is that there were once separate end tests
;   for numbers and strings.

; THE 'NATURAL LOGARITHM' FUNCTION 
; --------------------------------
; (offset $25: 'ln')
;   Function to calculate the natural logarithm (to the base e ). 
;   Natural logarithms were devised in 1614 by well-traveled Scotsman John 
;   Napier who noted
;   "Nothing doth more molest and hinder calculators than the multiplications,
;    divisions, square and cubical extractions of great numbers".
;
;   Napier's logarithms enabled the above operations to be accomplished by 
;   simple addition and subtraction simplifying the navigational and 
;   astronomical calculations which beset his age.
;   Napier's logarithms were quickly overtaken by logarithms to the base 10
;   devised, in conjunction with Napier, by Henry Briggs a Cambridge-educated 
;   professor of Geometry at Oxford University. These simplified the layout
;   of the tables enabling humans to easily scale calculations.
;
;   It is only recently with the introduction of pocket calculators and machines
;   like the ZX Spectrum that natural logarithms are once more at the fore,
;   although some computers retain logarithms to the base ten.
;
;   'Natural' logarithms are powers to the base 'e', which like 'pi' is a 
;   naturally occurring number in branches of mathematics.
;   Like 'pi' also, 'e' is an irrational number and starts 2.718281828...
;
;   The tabular use of logarithms was that to multiply two numbers one looked
;   up their two logarithms in the tables, added them together and then looked 
;   for the result in a table of antilogarithms to give the desired product.
;
;   The EXP function is the BASIC equivalent of a calculator's 'antiln' function 
;   and by picking any two numbers, 1.72 and 6.89 say,
;     10 PRINT EXP ( LN 1.72 + LN 6.89 ) 
;   will give just the same result as
;     20 PRINT 1.72 * 6.89.
;   Division is accomplished by subtracting the two logs.
;
;   Napier also mentioned "square and cubicle extractions". 
;   To raise a number to the power 3, find its 'ln', multiply by 3 and find the 
;   'antiln'.  e.g. PRINT EXP( LN 4 * 3 )  gives 64.
;   Similarly to find the n'th root divide the logarithm by 'n'.
;   The ZX81 ROM used PRINT EXP ( LN 9 / 2 ) to find the square root of the 
;   number 9. The Napieran square root function is just a special case of 
;   the 'to_power' function. A cube root or indeed any root/power would be just
;   as simple.

;   First test that the argument to LN is a positive, non-zero number.
;   Error A if the argument is 0 or negative.

; -----------------------------
; THE 'TRIGONOMETRIC' FUNCTIONS
; -----------------------------
; Trigonometry is rocket science. It is also used by carpenters and pyramid
; builders. 
; Some uses can be quite abstract but the principles can be seen in simple
; right-angled triangles. Triangles have some special properties -
;
; 1) The sum of the three angles is always PI radians (180 degrees).
;    Very helpful if you know two angles and wish to find the third.
; 2) In any right-angled triangle the sum of the squares of the two shorter
;    sides is equal to the square of the longest side opposite the right-angle.
;    Very useful if you know the length of two sides and wish to know the
;    length of the third side.
; 3) Functions sine, cosine and tangent enable one to calculate the length 
;    of an unknown side when the length of one other side and an angle is 
;    known.
; 4) Functions arcsin, arccosine and arctan enable one to calculate an unknown
;    angle when the length of two of the sides is known.

; --------------------------------
; THE 'REDUCE ARGUMENT' SUBROUTINE
; --------------------------------
; (offset $39: 'get-argt')
;
; This routine performs two functions on the angle, in radians, that forms
; the argument to the sine and cosine functions.
; First it ensures that the angle 'wraps round'. That if a ship turns through 
; an angle of, say, 3*PI radians (540 degrees) then the net effect is to turn 
; through an angle of PI radians (180 degrees).
; Secondly it converts the angle in radians to a fraction of a right angle,
; depending within which quadrant the angle lies, with the periodicity 
; resembling that of the desired sine value.
; The result lies in the range -1 to +1.

; The cosine of angle x is the adjacent side (a) divided by the hypotenuse 1.
; However if we examine angle y then a/h is the sine of that angle.
; Since angle x plus angle y equals a right-angle, we can find angle y by 
; subtracting angle x from pi/2.
; However it's just as easy to reduce the argument first and subtract the
; reduced argument from the value 1 (a reduced right-angle).
; It's even easier to subtract 1 from the angle and rectify the sign.
; In fact, after reducing the argument, the absolute value of the argument
; is used and rectified using the test result stored in mem-0 by 'get-argt'
; for that purpose.
