    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::MathInt64 - Include the Math::Int64 C client API
    in your distribution

VERSION

    version 0.10

SYNOPSIS

    in your dist.ini

     [PPPort]
     [MathInt64]
     [ModuleBuild]
     mb_class = MyDist::ModuleBuild

    in your xs (lib/MyDist.xs):

     #include "EXTERN.h"
     #include "perl.h"
     #include "XSUB.h"
     #include "ppport.h"
     
     /* provides int64_t and uint64_t if not   *
      * already available                      */
     #include "perl_math_int64_types.h"
     
     /* #define MATH_INT64_NATIVE_IF_AVAILABLE */
     #include "perl_math_int64.h"
     
     MODULE = MyDist  PACKAGE = MyDist

       CODE:
         int64_t native_number = SvI64(sv_number);
         ...
         RETVAL = newSVi64(native_number);
       OUTPUT:
         RETVAL

    See Math::Int64#C-API for details.

    in your Module::Build subclass (inc/MyDist/ModuleBuild.pm):

     package MyDist::ModuleBuild;
     
     use base qw( Module::Build );
     
     sub new
     {
       my($class, %args) = @_;
       $args{c_source} = '.';
       $class->SUPER::new(%args);
     }

DESCRIPTION

    Math::Int64 provides an API for Perl and XS modules for dealing with 64
    bit integers.

    This plugin imports the C client API from Math::Int64 into your
    distribution. The C client API depends on ppport.h, so make sure that
    you also get that (the easiest way is via the PPPort plugin.

    This plugin will also create an appropriate typemap or update an
    existing typemap to automatically support the types int64_t and
    uint64_t in your XS code. (You can turn this off by setting typemap =
    0).

    This plugin will also declare Math::Int64 as a prerequisite for your
    distribution.

    One thing this plugin does NOT do is, it doesn't tell either
    Module::Build or ExtUtils::MakeMaker where to find the C and XS
    sources. One way of doing this would be to create your own
    Module::Build subclass and set the c_source attribute to where the C
    header and source code go (see the synopsis above as an example).

ATTRIBUTES

 dir

    Directory to dump the C source and header files into. If not specified,
    they go into the distribution root. If you use this option you probably
    need to tell the PPPort plugin to put the ppport.h file in the same
    place.

     [PPPort]
     filename = xs/ppport.h
     [MathInt64]
     dir = xs

 typemap

    If set to true (the default), then create a typemap file if it does not
    already exist with the appropriate typemaps for 64 bit integers, or if
    a typemap already exists, add the 64 bit integer mappings.

 typemap_path

    The path to the typemap file (if typemap is true). The default is
    simply 'typemap'.

CAVEATS

    This plugin uses ExtUtils::Typemaps to munge the typemaps file, which
    strips any comments from the typemap file, but should be semantically
    identical. Versions prior to 0.05 did its own parsing but would retain
    comments.

BUNDLED SOFTWARE

    This distribution comes bundled with C source code placed in the public
    domain by Salvador Fandino.

    Thanks to Salvador Fandino for writing Math::Int64 and providing a XS /
    C Client API for other distribution authors.
