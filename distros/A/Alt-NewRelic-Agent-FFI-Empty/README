NAME

    Alt::NewRelic::Agent::FFI::Empty - NewRelic::Agent::FFI interface that
    doesn't do anything

VERSION

    version 0.03

SYNOPSIS

     env PERL_ALT_INSTALL=OVERWRITE cpanm Alt::NewRelic::Agent::FFI::Empty

DESCRIPTION

    NOTE: This module is deprecated. It is based on the NewRelic Agent SDK,
    which was only ever released as beta software. Please use NewFangle
    instead.

    This distribution provides an interface for NewRelic::Agent::FFI and
    NewRelic::Agent::FFI::Procedural that doesn't do anything. It might be
    useful for developing an application that uses NewRelic::Agent::FFI,
    that runs on a supported platform in production, but you want to
    develop parts of the code base that don't rely on NewRelic on a
    platform that is not supported (which is everything that isn't Linux
    AMD64 apparently).
