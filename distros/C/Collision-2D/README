Collision::2D

An object-oriented continuous collision detection library.

Here's how to use Collision::2D
1. Create some entities. Say you want detect a collision
   betwixt 2 rectangles. I recommend using hash2rect for
   DWIMMY goodness, or the constructor
   Collision::2D::Entity::Rect->new(%params).
   Parameters are x, y, h, w, xv, and yv.
2. Detect collisions with 
   my $collision = Collision::2D::dynamic_collision($ent1, $ent2, interval=>1);
   A Collision::2D::Collision object is returned in the event of a collision.
   This will return undef if the entities do not collide.
2. Alternatively, to detect static collision, i.e. intersection, 
   my $intersects = Collision::2D::intersection($ent1, $ent2);
   $intersects is a true or false value.
