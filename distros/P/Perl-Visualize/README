Perl::Visualize version 1.02
============================

Perl::Visualize generates GIF/Perl polyglots.  A polyglot is a program
that can be validly executed by multiple interpreters.  Usually,
polyglots are written in multiple *programming* languages -
Perl::Visualize is slightly different in that one of the languages
being generated is GIF - a format ordinarily used to encode images.
See perldoc for Perl::Visualize for more information.

SYNOPSIS

  # In program
  use Perl::Visualize qw/etch paint/;
  etch "larry.gif", "larrysig.gif", 'print "This is Larry Wall\n"';
  etch "nagra.gif", "nagraview.gif", 'exec "/usr/bin/display $0"';
  paint "damian.gif", "poetic-damian.gif", <<EOF;
  use Coy;
  Recite war "poetry";
  EOF

  # Sometime later
  bash$ perl larrysig.gif
  This is Larry Wall

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

Although this module does not require any other module to function
correctly, some of the examples included rely on other modules.  In
particular, the examples involving Piet require Piet::Interpreter and
the "99 bottles of beer example" requires perlmagick to be installed.
In fact, because using Perl::Visualize will result in the user wanting
to manipulate images, it is highly recommended that imagemagick and
perlmagick be installed to make full explore the module fully.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

I would like to thank Christian Collberg for not dissuading me from
writing this module. :-)
