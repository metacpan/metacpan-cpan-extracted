- BUGFIX: when creating a Gapp::Widget without keeping a reference to it, the
Gapp::Object would be garbage collected before the Gtk2::Widget was destroyed. Fixed
by creating a circular reference between the Gapp object and the Gtk widget. When
the Gtk object emits the "destroy" signal, the circular reference is broken, and
all involved objects are garbage collected.
