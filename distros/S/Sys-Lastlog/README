Sys::Lastlog
============

This module is designed to provided an Object Oriented API to the lastlog
file found on many Unix-like systems.  Some systems do not have this file
so this module will not be of much use on those systems.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

This module does require that the structure of the lastlog is defined in
the system C header files.  By default it will look for the definition in
utmp.h but some systems (notably Solaris) have a lastlog.h file which
contains the definition - if compilation fails because the C compiler has
been unable to find the definition then redo the install again but with
the first step as:

  perl Makefile.PL DEFINE='-DUSE_LASTLOG_H'

and hopefully then everything will be alright.  If it isnt then please
contact the author with as much information as might determine where
lastlog is defined.

Finally some systems may not define '_PATH_LASTLOG' in paths.h which will
lead to a compile time error for the XS part of this module - on these
systems you will need to supply this definition yourself :

  perl Makefile.PL DEFINE='-D_PATH_LASTLOG="/var/adm/lastlog"'

for example.  You will have to discover where the lastlog file on your
system resides for yourself.

It is infact highly likely that the above two circumstances will both
arise on the same system (Solaris again :) and that the two sets of
defines will need to be combined.

  perl Makefile.PL DEFINE='-D_PATH_LASTLOG="/var/adm/lastlog" -DUSE_LASTLOG_H'
