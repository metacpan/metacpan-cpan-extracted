      o "resume" option went to oblivion.
      o Taint mode support
      o Cache improvements.
      o "monolith" & interpolated includes do not mix. It now returns an error.

0.79_07 Thu Aug  6 04:17:38 2009
    - Implemented the monolith test.
    - monolith option does not work with interpolated includes. It's currently

    - Internal cleanup.
    - Implement block filter test.

0.79_03 Fri May  1 04:18:15 2009

    - Internal cleanup.
    - Add version checking into template disk cache.
    - Remove resume() completely.
      Was:
         - too complex

    - Fix for 24-include-paths.t.

0.54_17 Thu Oct  2 22:46:02 2008

    - Changed token format (swapped id <-> str).

0.54_14 Wed Oct  1 06:11:49 2008
    - Re-implemented the previous overcomplicated and buggy chomping interface.
      This is now solid.
         * Removed buggy chomping tests.
         * Also moved the chomping action into the parser.
    - Improved token dumping.

0.54_13 Tue Sep 23 20:53:34 2008
    - Renamed the test to "26-template-name-dollar-zero.t" as either the shell
      or the test suite seem to expand $0 in the file name. Weird, but too lazy
      to investigate the real cause.

0.54_12 Mon Sep 22 00:37:43 2008
    - Fixed template name access through $0.
    - New placeholder test.

0.54_11 Sat Sep 20 23:51:43 2008

    - Fix tokenizer bug.

0.54_09 Wed Sep 17 00:01:41 2008

      completes the chomp() interface. Unit tests & Pod to come...
    - Added roadmap & flow chart to distro.

0.54_08 Mon Sep 15 01:44:40 2008
    - More fixes for the _chomp().
    - Implemented pre/post chomp and collapse (tricky!).

0.54_07 Sun Sep 14 03:09:39 2008
    - Pod typos.
    - I/O layer fix.
    - Added ltrim/rtrim to Util.
    - Implemented the chomping inside the tokenizer.

0.54_06 Sat Sep 13 02:22:00 2008
    - You can now use $0 inside templates to access to the name of the template.
    - Added support for pre/post chomping (a la TT) into the tokenizer.
      The rest of the tokenizer or the parser currently does not support that,
      so it's practically useless for now (<%- -%>, <%=- -%>, etc.).

0.54_05 Fri Sep 12 00:15:23 2008
    - Implemented include paths.

0.54_04 Wed Sep 10 22:26:35 2008

    - Implemented comment directives.
    - Removed fix_uncuddled. Seemed like nonsense :p
    - Added DEBUG_TOKENS to the tokenizer.
    - Implemented & documented the no "monolith" option
      (also renamed cache_monolith to monolith).
    - ".tts" is now the official file extension for Text::Template::Simple
      templates. Updated test suite and Pod to reflect this.

0.54_01 Sat Aug 30 20:12:09 2008
    - Fix _parser_id().
    - Pod updates.
    - Implemented the "dynamic" include directive.
    - Implemented interpolation in includes
    - New tests for includes.

    - Added a mechanism to make it possible to add new tokens and token handlers.
    - New sub modules:
        Text::Template::Simple::Cache      - Cache object
        Text::Template::Simple::Cache::ID  - Cache ID generator
        Text::Template::Simple::IO         - I/O methods
        Text::Template::Simple::Deprecated - Temporary module to support old interface for a while
    - All cache methods are now accessible through the cache object.
    - All I/O methods are now accessible through the io object.
    - New cache tests.

0.50 Sun Dec 30 22:05:32 2007

    - Fix typos.
    - Added Perl::Tidy support. If you have this module, bogus templates
      will be displayed in a tidied way. This also enabled for displaying
      template fragments (if debug is enabled and set to a higher value).
    - Forgot a single quote in the resume template.

0.49_08 Sat Dec 15 00:48:48 2007
    - Each subclass is now in it's own file. Monolithic module is no more.
    - Internal cleanup.

0.49_07 Sun Dec  9 23:00:33 2007

      interface (and Pod) related to this has now been removed.
    - Exporter is back. But with different export keys.
    - Internal cleanup.
    - New subclassing tests.

0.49_06 Sun Dec  2 21:49:38 2007
    - Improved I/O Layer handling.
    - Pod fix.

0.49_05 Sat Dec  1 23:54:15 2007
    - Code cleanup.
    - Removed IS_DEBUG().
    - Removed Exporter.
    - Removed old code.
    - Restored verbose error message when there is a compilation error.

0.49_04 Fri Nov 30 00:12:23 2007
    - Added a "check" option to map_keys.
    - Code cleanup.

0.49_03 Wed Nov 28 01:05:26 2007

    - Replaced the parser with a new sleek & sexy tokenizer.
    - Unbalanced delimiter error now gives the type of missing one.

0.49_02 Sun Nov  4 00:09:53 2007
    - Fixed a typo in Text::Template::Simple::Caller::_text_table();
    - All distro files now has LF line ending.

    - Fixed Win32 compatibility (again).

0.48 Tue May 29 21:40:16 2007
    - Removed AUTOLOAD.
    - When I issue a dump_cache() with Data::Dumper & 
      Deparse() enabled, under mod_perl2 or PerlEx,
      I got a strange error: 

         Can't locate object method "first" via package "B::SVOP" at ...

      This does not happen suddenly, but after I call dump_cache()
      three times. 
      
      I couldn't duplicate the error with a simple example, so 
      this may be related to some other part of my actual code 
      (not related to Text::Template::Simple). I've created a 
      workaround for now. If you get the same error somehow 
      (it is now a warning) please report via RT and include
      a sample code if possible.
    - Internal cleanup.
    - Test::More is now required.

0.47 Thu Jan  4 18:16:21 2007
    - Implemented an I/O layer mechanism.
    - Fixed Win32 compatibility 
      (older perls don't have a Win32.pm)

0.46 Thu Dec 21 20:16:33 2006
    - Bugfix in _resume().
    - Internal changes:
         Replaced remaining die()s with croak()s.
         s[} else {][}\n else {]sg;
    - Added a new test to demonstrate extending 
      Text::Template::Simple.
    - Safe templates were not working. Fixed by 
      adding a require opcode (disable strict to
      disable require).
    - Added a safe test.

0.45 Sat Dec 16 22:15:18 2006
    - Internal optimization.
    - Added line number and file name emulation to parser.
      You have to use file templates or enable cache to 
      enable this feature.
    - Implemented a resume method. If enabled, the compiler 
      will resume on fatal errors. There are some buggy parts
      and it will slow down the compilation process.

0.44 Sat Sep  9 10:44:43 2006
    - Forgot to remove development code.
      Fixed versions in this file.

0.43 Fri Sep  8 20:52:41 2006
    - Internal cleanup & optimization.

0.42 Fri Sep  8 14:23:34 2006
    - Added fix_uncuddled option (bool) to new & 
      implemented it. If you are a uncuddled else/elsif
      fan, enable this or your template will die a horrible
      death.

0.41 Tue Aug  8 04:01:44 2006
    - Fixed flock() check.
    - New option to new(): warn_ids.

    - Completely new API and new design.

0.2 Thu Dec  1 22:24:35 2005
    - New extended interface.
