  Tk::ProgressBar
	o value() method now resets value to -from option
	  value when it get the undef value. (Now creating
	  a ProgressBar without args does not complain about
	  undefined values.

	o Tk800 markup style fixes in POD

  Tk::NumEntryPlain
	o replaced DoWhenIdle with afterIdle so a
	  pending idle callback is canceled when widget
	  is destroyed.

        o Used 'incdec' instead of \&incdec in afterIdle
	  callback for proper subclassing. 

	o enabled -textvariable + doc: that's only
	  save for read

  Tk::NumEntry:
	o specify -anchor=>'center' for FireButton so
	  one does not rely on the fact that it's the
	  default.
	o explicitly with off Focus of FireButton to 
	  prevent hanging focus with hidden buttons.

	o Tk800 markup style fixes in POD

  Tk::FireButton:
	o Apply Slaven Rezic (thanks) Firebutton patch so
    	  option handling work and ContextHelp works
    	  with FireButton.  This also fixes the
    	  'hanging focus' problem Stephen O'Lidie
    	  reported with NumEntry and hidden inc/dec.

	o Tk800 markup style fixes in POD

	o removed -anchor from ConfigSpec because it same
	  as for Button.

  Tk::TFrame
  Tk::Pane
  Tk::Cloth
	o Tk800 markup style fixes in POD
	o CR update and email pobox.com

  Tk/*, Makefile.PL, MANIFEST

	o better perllocal.pod entry now Tk::GBARR instead of Tk
          (moved Tk/* . and set WriteMakefile's NAME to Tk::GBARR,
    	  updated MANIFEST)

	o added 1998 to copyright and changed @ti.com @pobox.com.

  t/0basic.t
	o simple tests for all widgets (derived from
	  Tk800.005/t/create.t). Finds ConfigSpecs bug.

  t/1numentryplain.t
	o test if read of -textvariable works.
