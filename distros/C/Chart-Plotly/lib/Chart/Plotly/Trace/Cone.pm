=head1 METHODS

=head2 TO_JSON

Serialize the trace to JSON. This method should be called only by L<JSON> serializer.

=head2 type

Trace type.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=over

=item * anchor

Sets the cones' anchor with respect to their x/y/z positions. Note that *cm* denote the cone's center of mass which corresponds to 1/4 from the tail to tip.

=item * autocolorscale

Determines whether the colorscale is a default palette (`autocolorscale: true`) or the palette determined by `colorscale`. In case `colorscale` is unspecified or `autocolorscale` is true, the default  palette will be chosen according to whether numbers in the `color` array are all positive, all negative or mixed.

=item * cauto

Determines whether or not the color domain is computed with respect to the input data (here u/v/w norm) or the bounds set in `cmin` and `cmax`  Defaults to `false` when `cmin` and `cmax` are set by the user.

=item * cmax

Sets the upper bound of the color domain. Value should have the same units as u/v/w norm and if set, `cmin` must be set as well.

=item * cmid

Sets the mid-point of the color domain by scaling `cmin` and/or `cmax` to be equidistant to this point. Value should have the same units as u/v/w norm. Has no effect when `cauto` is `false`.

=item * cmin

Sets the lower bound of the color domain. Value should have the same units as u/v/w norm and if set, `cmax` must be set as well.

=item * coloraxis

Sets a reference to a shared color axis. References to these shared color axes are *coloraxis*, *coloraxis2*, *coloraxis3*, etc. Settings for these shared color axes are set in the layout, under `layout.coloraxis`, `layout.coloraxis2`, etc. Note that multiple color scales can be linked to the same color axis.

=item * colorbar

=item * colorscale

Sets the colorscale. The colorscale must be an array containing arrays mapping a normalized value to an rgb, rgba, hex, hsl, hsv, or named color string. At minimum, a mapping for the lowest (0) and highest (1) values are required. For example, `[[0, 'rgb(0,0,255)', [1, 'rgb(255,0,0)']]`. To control the bounds of the colorscale in color space, use`cmin` and `cmax`. Alternatively, `colorscale` may be a palette name string of the following list: Greys,YlGnBu,Greens,YlOrRd,Bluered,RdBu,Reds,Blues,Picnic,Rainbow,Portland,Jet,Hot,Blackbody,Earth,Electric,Viridis,Cividis.

=item * customdata

Assigns extra data each datum. This may be useful when listening to hover, click and selection events. Note that, *scatter* traces also appends customdata items in the markers DOM elements

=item * customdatasrc

Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  customdata .

=item * hoverinfo

Determines which trace information appear on hover. If `none` or `skip` are set, no information is displayed upon hovering. But, if `none` is set, click and hover events are still fired.

=item * hoverinfosrc

Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  hoverinfo .

=item * hoverlabel

=item * hovertemplate

Template string used for rendering the information that appear on hover box. Note that this will override `hoverinfo`. Variables are inserted using %{variable}, for example "y: %{y}". Numbers are formatted using d3-format's syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for example "Price: %{y:$.2f}". See https://github.com/d3/d3-format/blob/master/README.md#locale_format for details on the formatting syntax. The variables available in `hovertemplate` are the ones emitted as event data described at this link https://plot.ly/javascript/plotlyjs-events/#event-data. Additionally, every attributes that can be specified per-point (the ones that are `arrayOk: true`) are available. variable `norm` Anything contained in tag `<extra>` is displayed in the secondary box, for example "<extra>{fullData.name}</extra>". To hide the secondary box completely, use an empty tag `<extra></extra>`.

=item * hovertemplatesrc

Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  hovertemplate .

=item * hovertext

Same as `text`.

=item * hovertextsrc

Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  hovertext .

=item * ids

Assigns id labels to each datum. These ids for object constancy of data points during animation. Should be an array of strings, not numbers or any other type.

=item * idssrc

Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  ids .

=item * lighting

=item * lightposition

=item * pmeta

Assigns extra meta information associated with this trace that can be used in various text attributes. Attributes such as trace `name`, graph, axis and colorbar `title.text`, annotation `text` `rangeselector`, `updatemenues` and `sliders` `label` text all support `meta`. To access the trace `meta` values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use `%{meta[i]}` where `i` is the index or key of the `meta` item in question. To access trace `meta` in layout attributes, use `%{data[n[.meta[i]}` where `i` is the index or key of the `meta` and `n` is the trace index.

=item * metasrc

Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  meta .

=item * name

Sets the trace name. The trace name appear as the legend item and on hover.

=item * opacity

Sets the opacity of the surface. Please note that in the case of using high `opacity` values for example a value greater than or equal to 0.5 on two surfaces (and 0.25 with four surfaces), an overlay of multiple transparent surfaces may not perfectly be sorted in depth by the webgl API. This behavior may be improved in the near future and is subject to change.

=item * reversescale

Reverses the color mapping if true. If true, `cmin` will correspond to the last color in the array and `cmax` will correspond to the first color.

=item * scene

Sets a reference between this trace's 3D coordinate system and a 3D scene. If *scene* (the default value), the (x,y,z) coordinates refer to `layout.scene`. If *scene2*, the (x,y,z) coordinates refer to `layout.scene2`, and so on.

=item * showscale

Determines whether or not a colorbar is displayed for this trace.

=item * sizemode

Determines whether `sizeref` is set as a *scaled* (i.e unitless) scalar (normalized by the max u/v/w norm in the vector field) or as *absolute* value (in the same units as the vector field).

=item * sizeref

Adjusts the cone size scaling. The size of the cones is determined by their u/v/w norm multiplied a factor and `sizeref`. This factor (computed internally) corresponds to the minimum "time" to travel across two successive x/y/z positions at the average velocity of those two successive positions. All cones in a given trace use the same factor. With `sizemode` set to *scaled*, `sizeref` is unitless, its default value is *0.5* With `sizemode` set to *absolute*, `sizeref` has the same units as the u/v/w vector field, its the default value is half the sample's maximum vector norm.

=item * stream

=item * text

Sets the text elements associated with the cones. If trace `hoverinfo` contains a *text* flag and *hovertext* is not set, these elements will be seen in the hover labels.

=item * textsrc

Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  text .

=item * u

Sets the x components of the vector field.

=item * uid

Assign an id to this trace, Use this to provide object constancy between traces during animations and transitions.

=item * uirevision

Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name` and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`. Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`, `selectedpoints` is controlled by `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)` (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove traces before the end of the `data` array, such that the same trace has a different index, you can still preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a `uid` that stays with it as it moves.

=item * usrc

Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  u .

=item * v

Sets the y components of the vector field.

=item * visible

Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If *legendonly*, the trace is not drawn, but can appear as a legend item (provided that the legend itself is visible).

=item * vsrc

Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  v .

=item * w

Sets the z components of the vector field.

=item * wsrc

Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  w .

=item * x

Sets the x coordinates of the vector field and of the displayed cones.

=item * xsrc

Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  x .

=item * y

Sets the y coordinates of the vector field and of the displayed cones.

=item * ysrc

Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  y .

=item * z

Sets the z coordinates of the vector field and of the displayed cones.

=item * zsrc

Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  z .
