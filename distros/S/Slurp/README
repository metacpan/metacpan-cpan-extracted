NAME
    Slurp - Slurp entire files into variables

SYNOPSIS
     use Slurp;

     my $file = slurp($file1, $file2, ...);

     my @array = Slurp::to_array($filename);
     my $scalar = Slurp::to_scalar($filename);

DESCRIPTION
    This simple module serves one purpose - to provide a simple means to
    read (or slurp) an entire file into memory for processing. This module
    allows the replacement of the prototypical foreach- or while- loops used
    for opening and reading of files with single-line constructs.

    Of note with this module is that the magic of the @ARGV variable and the
    input record separator, $/, are used to facilitate the reading of entire
    files into either an array or scalar using minimal code.

METHODS
    The following methods are available through this module for use in other
    applications. By default, the "slurp" method is exported into the
    calling namespace - The other methods of this module, "to_array" and
    "to_scalar", may also be exported into the calling namespace.

    slurp
         my @array = slurp($filename, ...);
         my $scalar = slurp($filename, ...);

        This method slurps one or more files, specified by filenames passed
        to this method as arguments, into memory. The assignment can be made
        either either an array or scalar depending upon the context in which
        this method was called.

    to_array
         my @array = Slurp::to_array($filename, ...);
         my $array_ref = Slurp::to_array($filename, ...);

        This method slurps one or more files, specified by filenames passed
        to this method as arguments, into memory. If called in a scalar
        context, this method returns an array reference - This is
        particularly useful if dealing with large files.

    to_scalar
         my $scalar = Slurp::to_scalar($filename, ...);

        This method slurps one or more files, specified by filenames passed
        to this method as arguments, into a scalar variable.
