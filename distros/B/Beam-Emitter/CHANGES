Changelog for Beam-Emitter

1.007     2017-01-29 01:43:15-06:00 America/Chicago

    [Fixed]

    - Passing in an overridden emitter when emitting an event no longer
      uses the emitter's boolean overload. This could cause the wrong
      emitter to be used in the event. Thanks @djerius (Github #25)

1.006     2016-11-23 22:35:48-06:00 America/Chicago

    [Added]

    - Added a couple more cookbook entries to show Beam::Emitter
      patterns

    [Fixed]

    - Events with no listeners now correctly return the Event object
      like they used to. This was a regression starting in v1.004.
      Thanks @eserte and CPAN Testers for the report (Github #24)

1.005     2016-11-22 12:56:41-06:00 America/Chicago

    [Fixed]

    - Custom listener classes are now loaded automatically. This
      prevents a very strange error about the unloaded class not
      inheriting from Beam::Listener, even though it does. Perl doesn't
      know that it does, because the class isn't loaded, and there's no
      good way to detect if a class is loaded or if it failed to load.
      So, to make it easier, Beam::Emitter now simply loads the class
      for you. Thanks @djerius (Github #23)

1.004     2016-11-17 17:28:01-06:00 America/Chicago

    [Added]

    - Allow the event's name to be overridden when emitting the event.
      This is a rare thing to want, but it makes some future cookbook
      items (like a catch-all '*' event) more useful.

    - Allow the event's emitter object to be overridden when emitting
      the event. This, too, is a rare thing to want, but it allows an
      object to more easily proxy the event emitter if needed. Thanks
      @djerius! (Github #19)

    - Added a Cookbook document (Beam::Emitter::Cookbook) to start
      demonstrating some useful patterns that aren't quite useful or
      generally-desired enough to be part of the main distribution
      always. Thanks @yanick for the help! (Github #12)

    - Enhanced how Beam::Emitter tracks listeners by creating
      Beam::Listener objects with the option of adding additional
      metadata to the listener by extending the Beam::Listener class.
      Thanks @djerius! (Github #16)

    - Added a method (`listeners()`) to list the current listeners
      (Beam::Listener objects) for an event. Thanks @djerius! (Github
      #16)

    [Fixed]

    - The Beam::Emitter role no longer pollutes the consumer's namespace
      with things from Types::Standard, Scalar::Util, and Carp. Thanks
      @kentnl! (Github #13)

      This could result in problems if you accidentally depended on this
      behavior. To fix these problems, please import the correct subs
      explicitly.

    - The Beam::Emitter role now allows composing classes to use method
      modifiers for the `subscribe` and `unsubscribe` methods.
      Previously, if the composing class overrode either of those
      methods, those changes would be ignored by the `on` and `un`
      aliases. Now, the `on` and `un` aliases use proper method
      resolution. This means that if you want to modify behaviors of
      your class on subscribe and unsubscribe, you must only modify the
      `subscribe` and `unsubscribe` methods. (Github #18)

1.003     2016-11-11 21:35:53-06:00 America/Chicago

    [Fixed]

    - Fix the unsubscribe callback (returned from the `subscribe`
      method) throwing an exception if the emitter object has already
      been destroyed. Since the unsubscribe callback has a weak
      reference to the emitter object, we have to make sure the
      reference still exists before using it to unsubscribe. Thanks
      @djerius! (Github #14)

    - Fix unsubscribing from an event during an event not firing all the
      rest of the events properly. When using the unsubscribe callback
      to create a one-time event handler, the emitter could miss the
      next event listener (since we were looping over the listeners
      array and modifying it in the loop). Now we loop over a copy of
      the listeners array so that the original can be modified to remove
      the listener we want. Thanks @djerius! (Github #15)
