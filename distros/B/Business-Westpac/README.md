# NAME

Business::Westpac - Top level namespace for the Business::Westpac
set of modules

# VERSION

0.02

# DESCRIPTION

Business::Westpac is a set of libraries for parsing/generating files
for use with Westpac bank as documented at
[https://paymentsplus.westpac.com.au/docs/](https://paymentsplus.westpac.com.au/docs/)

Note that this distribution is a work in progress or, if you prefer,
"incomplete" - we started working on it under the expectation of Westpac
being our banking partner but ended up going with another one so have
effectively abandoned development on this. It has been uploaded to
CPAN/github for anyone else to use/extended/fork/etc.

# Do Not Use This Module Directly

You should go to the relevant module for the file format you want to
work with.
