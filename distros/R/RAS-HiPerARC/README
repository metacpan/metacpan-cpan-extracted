RAS::HiPerARC.pm
Version 1.03, June 9, 2000


DESCRIPTION

RAS::HiPerARC is a PERL 5 module for interfacing with a 
3Com/USR Total Control HiPerARC remote access server. Using 
this module, one can very easily construct programs to find a 
particular user in a bank of ARCs, disconnect users, get usage 
statistics, or execute arbitrary commands on a ARC.


PREREQUISITES AND INSTALLATION

This module uses Jay Rogers' Net::Telnet module. If you don't have 
Net::Telnet, get it from CPAN or this module won't do much for you.

Installation is easy:
   perl Makefile.PL && make && make test
   make install

Check out the examples in the documentation for ideas on how you'd 
want to use this module.
