Encode/CP1252 version 0.33
==========================

Have you ever been processing a Web form submit, assuming that the incoming
text was encoded in ISO-8859-1 (Latin-1), only to end up with a bunch of junk
because someone pasted in content from Microsoft Word? Well, this is because
Microsoft uses a superset of the Latin-1 encoding called "Windows Western" or
"CP1252". So mostly things will come out right, but a few things--like curly
quotes, m-dashes, ellipses, and the like--will not. The differences are
well-known; you see a nice chart at documenting the differences on
[Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows-1252).

Of course, that won't really help you. So this library's module,
Encode::ZapCP1252, provides subroutines for removing Windows Western Gremlins
from strings, turning them into their appropriate UTF-8 or ASCII
approximations:

    my $clean_latin1 = zap_cp1252 $latin1_text;
    my $fixed_utf8   = fix_cp1252 $utf8_text;
