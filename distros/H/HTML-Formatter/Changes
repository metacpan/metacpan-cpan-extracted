2.10      2011-07-18 17:07:35 Europe/London
    - Tests reworked to not use subtests.  Development versions
      of Test::More do not support subtests, and the smokers
      that are running with these dev versions then send me
      confusing test failures.  This is a pain.

    - Reworking of HTML quote issue in FormatPS
    - Now remap all double quotes to " in FormatPS (which is not
      really right, but the best I can do with latin1 output)

      to see if test release threw up any issues...

    - minor bugfix
      The lack of \plain's in HTML::FormatRTF's output was confusing some
      formatters.  Fixed.


2.02      2002-11-16   Sean M. Burke <sburke@cpan.org>
    - minor bugfix
      Changed the set_version_tag method in HTML::Formatter to avoid some
      undef warnings that "James W. Durkin" <jwd@phonogram.net> found.

      No big bug reports on the previous version, so maybe it's not so
      experimental after all!
