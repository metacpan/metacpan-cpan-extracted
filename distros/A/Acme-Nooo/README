Acme-Nooo version 0.01
======================

Tired of ``object-fetishist'' modules that force you to create a
handle object when a simple procedural interface would have been
sufficient? Acme::Nooo will import functions into the current
namespace to de-objectify abominable interfaces.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install
