NAME
    Die::Hard - objects as resistant to dying as John Maclane

SYNOPSIS
     my $fragile = Fragile::Object->new;
     my $diehard = Die::Hard->new($fragile);
 
     $diehard->isa('Fragile::Object'); # true
     $diehard->method_that_will_die;   # lives!
     $fragile->method_that_will_die;   # dies!

DESCRIPTION
    Die::Hard allows you to create fairly transparent wrapper object that
    delegates all method calls through to the wrapped object, but does so
    within an `eval { ... }` block. If the wrapped method call dies, then it
    sets a `last_error` attribute.

  Constructor
    `new(%attributes)`
        Standard Moose-style constructor.

    `new($object)`
        Shortcut for setting the `proxy_for` attribute.

  Attributes
    `proxy_for`
        The object being wrapped. Read-only; required.

    `last_error`
        If the last proxied method call died, then this attribute will contain
        the error. Otherwise will be undef.

  Methods
    `isa`
        Tells lies; claims to be the object it's proxying.

    `DOES`
        Tells the truth; claims to do the object it's proxying.

    `can`
        Tells the truth; claims it can do anything the object it's proxying
        can do.

    No::Die.

    The $_try function from Object::Util is a different way to achieve a
    similar effect.
