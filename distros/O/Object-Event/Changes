Revision history for Object-Event:

1.23    Thu Aug  4 10:52:32 CEST 2011
        - added small safety-check to unreg_cb.

1.22    Thu Mar 10 17:17:58 CET 2011
        - fixed a bug where event methods were not registered correctly.
        - found a bug with using the guard to track cb registrations.

1.21    Thu Nov  5 19:37:58 CET 2009
        - fixed a bug in the legacy forward code to support the old
          AnyEvent::XMPP API.

1.2     Thu Nov  5 00:01:47 CET 2009
        - removed hand_event_methods_down and inherit_event_methods_from
          in favour of the event_cb attribute, which made inheriting event
          method much easier.
        - added event_cb alias attribute parameter to be able to specify
          multiple package method event handlers for an object.
        - added some debugging functionality.

1.101   Fri Sep  4 14:24:58 CEST 2009
        - fixed stupid bug in event method, returning always false
          (added test for that now).
        - using common::sense now.

1.1     Sun Aug  9 18:05:08 CEST 2009
        - fixed some really wrong documentation (i.e.: about return values of
          the event method).
        - added init method for cases where you can't use the Object::Event
          constructor.
        - testing for undefined $self in the guard destructor.
        - added 'handles' method to query whether handlers exist.
        - made the 'event' method return true or false in case
          handlers ran.

1.0     Mon Mar 16 21:23:02 CET 2009
        - added stop/continue feature.
        - deprecated forward feature.
          (will be kept until AnyEvent::XMPP 0.4 is replaced by the new
           AnyEvent::XMPP, in around 1 year probably.)
        - added support for arbitrary priorities.
        - added syntactic sugar for using method calling syntax
          as event invocation.

0.7     Wed Feb 18 11:56:40 CET 2009
        NOTE: This is the last release which will contain the add_forward
        feature. The next release will contain some minor incompatible changes.

        - added unreg_my_set method.
        - fixed bug in _while_referenced implementation
          and added tests (by Pedro Melo)
        - some more tests.
        - added ::Methods syntactic sugar. Please note that the next
          version might contain some incompatible changes here.

0.6     Tue Sep 23 15:13:23 CEST 2008
        - recursive event calling now also should work properly.

0.4     Tue Apr 15 12:48:11 CEST 2008
        - events can now be registered from within the
          callbacks for the same object and event safely.
