[V 1.09]
Date=2017-04-16T11:16:00
Comments= <<EOT
- Adopt new repo structure. For details, see
http://savage.net.au/Ron/html/My.Workflow.for.Building.Distros.html.
- Fix issue with open(my $fh...) used twice in generate_xml_file(). The 2nd use of 'my' was
chopped. Reported by Nigel Horne. See RT#120946.
- Add the option validate_gedcom_file, which takes a Boolean value, to the set of options
accepted by new() and hence accepted by bin/timeline.pl. It defaults to 0, so that
validate() is no longer called by default. Suggested by Nigel Horne. See RT#120973.
- In bin/timeline.pl, document much more clearly what values are taken by each option.
Do the same in the pod.
- Fix docs for new(). It takes a hash of options, not a hashref.
- Add specific versions of pre-reqs in Makefile.PL.
- Rewrite t/test.t to run bin/timeline.pl under control of Capture::Tiny, and check its output.
This requires Capture::Tiny as a new pre-req.
