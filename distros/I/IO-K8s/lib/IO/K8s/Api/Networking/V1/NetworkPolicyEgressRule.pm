If this field is present and contains at least one item, then this rule allows traffic only if the traffic matches at least one port in the list.

=head2 to

If this field is empty or missing, this rule matches all destinations (traffic not restricted by destination). If this field is present and contains at least one item, this rule allows traffic only if the traffic matches at least one item in the to list.
