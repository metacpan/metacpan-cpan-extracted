Installing Uplug
----------------

Get the sources and Uplug modules from
https://bitbucket.org/tiedemann/uplug

You can either run Uplug without explicitly installing it 
or you can run the usual perlish installation steps (for putting Uplug into a global loction)

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   sudo make install

Note: Uplug includes some pre-compiled binaries (see share/bin). You may have to compile and install your own binaries in case your OS and system architecture is not supported. Currently, there are GNU/Linux binaries (i686 and x86_64) and Intel-based Mac OSX (x86_64) binaries.

There are language-specific packages with annotation tools and pre-rpocessing pipelines. Check the Uplug website for details. Download the packages you like to use and follow there installation instructions.
