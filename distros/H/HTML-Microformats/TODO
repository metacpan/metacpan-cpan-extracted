* Documentation is pretty sketchy.

* More test cases.

* AUTOLOADed get methods:
	- document them better
		+ can auto-generate much docs using ->format_signature 
	- ensure they can be called as get_X and get_Y where X is the microformat
          class/rel name, and Y is the hash key from ->data which sometimes differ.
		+ make sure any such differences are clearly documented

* Microformats 2.0???

* Drop dependencies on CGI/CGI::Util and URI::URL.
