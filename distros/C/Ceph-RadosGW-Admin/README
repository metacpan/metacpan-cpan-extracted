SYNOPSIS

            my $admin = Ceph::RadosGW::Admin->new(
                    access_key => 'not really secret',
                    secret_key => 'actually secret',
                    url        => 'https://your.rados.gateway.com/',
            );
            
            my $user  = $admin->create_user(
                    uid          => 'myusername',
                    display_name => 'my user name',
            );
            
            # they're really evil, suspending them should be enough
            $user->suspended(1);
            $user->save;
            
            # nah, they're really evil
            $user->delete;
            
            my $otheruser = $admin->get_user(uid => 'other');
            
            my @keys          = $otheruser->keys();
            my @keys_plus_one = $otheruser->create_key();
            
            $otheruser->delete_key(access_key => $keys[0]->{access_key});
            
            my @buckets = $otheruser->get_bucket_info();
            

DESCRIPTION

    This module provides an interface to the Admin OPs
    <http://docs.ceph.com/docs/master/radosgw/adminops/> interface of a
    ceph rados gateway. It is at this time incomplete, with only the parts
    needed by the authors implemented. Patches for the rest of the
    functionality are encouraged.

METHODS

 get_user

    Returns a Ceph::RadosGW::Admin::User object representing the given uid.

    Dies if the user does not exist.

    Example:

            my $user = $admin->get_user(uid => 'someuserhere');
            

 create_user

    Makes a new user on the rados gateway, and returns a
    Ceph::RadosGW::Admin::User object representing that user.

    Dies on failure.

    Example:

            my $new_user = $admin->create_user(
                    uid          => 'username',
                    display_name => 'Our New User',
            );

TODO

      * The docs are pretty middling at the moment.

      * This module has only been tested against the Dumpling release of
      ceph.
