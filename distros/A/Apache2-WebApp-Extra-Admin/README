DESCRIPTION

    existing project using the "webapp-extra" helper script provided with
    the WebApp::Toolkit

    * Compatible with Internet Explorer, Firefox, Safari, Chrome, and Opera
    web browsers.
    * User management panel.
    * User action logging.
    * Result sorting capabilities.

PREREQUISITES
      Apache2::WebApp
      Apache2::WebApp::Plugin::DateTime
      Apache2::WebApp::Plugin::DBI (optional)
      Apache::Htpasswd
      Params::Validate

INSTALLATION
    From source:

      $ tar xfz Apache2-WebApp-Extra-Admin-0.X.X.tar.gz
      $ perl MakeFile.PL PREFIX=~/path/to/custom/dir LIB=~/path/to/custom/lib
      $ make
      $ make install

    Perl one liner using CPAN.pm:

      $ perl -MCPAN -e 'install Apache2::WebApp::Extra::Admin'

    Use of CPAN.pm in interactive mode:

      $ perl -MCPAN -e shell
      cpan> install Apache2::WebApp::Extra::Admin
      cpan> quit

    Just like the manual installation of Perl modules, the user may need
    root access during this process to insure write permission is allowed
    within the installation directory.

GETTING STARTED
  HELPER SCRIPT
   Export project settings to the Unix shell
      $ source /path/to/project/.projrc

   Add this *Extra* to an existing project
      $ webapp-extra Admin

   Restart your application
      $ webapp-kickstart

   Accessing the admin control panel
      http://domain.com/app/admin

CONFIGURATION
    Unless it already exists, add the following to your projects
    *webapp.conf*

      [custom]
      items_per_page = 25     # default value

SECURITY
    By default, the admin control panel is public and not secure. You can
    enable user access controls by adding the following *Apache* directives
    into your project "httpd.conf"

      <Location /app/admin>
          AuthType Basic
          AuthName "Admin"
          AuthUserFile /home/webapp/conf/htpasswd
          Require valid-user
      </Location>

    As always, you must restart your application for changes to take effect.

ADMIN ACCESS
    The login information below is currently set-up by default. In order to
    manage user access this account must exist within your "htpasswd"

      User Name       admin
      Password        password

OPTIONAL
    If database support is available, you can log control panel user actions
    to a database. The database table to store logging information is
    auto-generated. Since this is the case, the SQL user must have CREATE
    privileges.

    In case you want to manually create this table, you can run the
    following SQL statement on the database command-line:

      CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS admin_log (
          admin_log_id int(3) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
          admin_log_username varchar(15) DEFAULT NULL,
          admin_log_action varchar(55) DEFAULT NULL,
          admin_log_query_string text,
          admin_log_user_ip_addr varchar(15) DEFAULT NULL,
          admin_log_created datetime DEFAULT NULL,
          PRIMARY KEY (admin_log_id)
        );

    If a database is not available at the time data is collected, this
    information will be written to a file that can be located in your
    project "logs" directory.

DEBUG MODE
    If debugging is enabled, the URI and query string are logged. This can
    pose as a security risk when running in a production environment since
    personal information (including passwords) may be exposed.
