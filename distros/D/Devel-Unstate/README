NAME
    Devel::Unstate - Disable 'state' keyword statelessness

DESCRIPTION
    This module makes all state variables behave as if they were my
    variables. This can be useful for testing, when you cache some data in
    your application, but want to get fresh values on each test iteration.

    The effect of "Devel::Unstate" is global. But only variable declarations
    compiled after it is loaded are affected.
