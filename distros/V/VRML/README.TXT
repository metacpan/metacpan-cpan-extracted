To install this module, cd to the directory that this README file is
in and type the following:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make test
	make install

Documentation for these modules is part of the files themselves using
the pod (Plain Old Documentation) format, and can be read using the
pod2man and pod2html programs that come with perl5.001.  To convert
them into manual page format, type something like the following:

	pod2man VRML.pm > VRML.1

To convert them into html format, type:

	pod2html VRML.pm > VRML.html

For your convenience, html-ized documentation is already installed in
the doc/ subdirectory.

Online documentation of these modules as well as related modules (such
as the earlier VRML.pm module)  can be found at:
