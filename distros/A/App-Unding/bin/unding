=head1 NAME

unding - dark magic, encrypted wallet

=head1 VERSION

version 0.004

=head1 SYNOPSIS

This is an executable script, not a library.
Since this script needs write access on it self (yes!), it's best you copy it to your local directory before using.

 cp $(which unding) .
 chmod 755 unding

Encrypt a file. Content will be stored in unding.
Attention: File will remain on disk!

 ./unding /path/to/file

Decrypt and display content stored in unding.

 ./unding

In both cases you must enter a password, but no prompt will tell you so.

=head1 MOTIVATION

B<Why «dark magic»?> The script uses a technique which making use of, is higly disencouraged by intelligent programmers:
L<https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41061214/write-to-the-data-section-in-perl>

B<Why the name «unding»?> C<unding> derives from the German I<Un-Ding>, meaning the negation of a thing, a I<Not-Thing> (nothing).
The negation can be meant pejoratively, relating to the I<dark magic> invoced.
But also descriptively, because the script transforms a I<thing> (text) into a I<nothing> (cypher text).

B<So what's in for me?> The I<dark magic> offers you your encrypted secrets together with the code to decrypt it in one single file.
All you need to de- and encrypt is this file and a Perl environment.
No separation of ciphertext and cryptologic.

=head1 WARNINGS

=over

=item This is an early release. Use it at your own risk.

=item While encryption, the script does not check if it overwrites existing encrypted data.

=item While encryption, the script does not check if the password is the same as before. Decrypt once to be sure you made no typos.

=item After encryption, the script does not delete the original file. You have to do this yourself. This may be considered a feature, since it might prevent loss of data.
