NAME
    RT-Extension-Tags - Provides simple tagging using custom fields

DESCRIPTION
    This extension allows you to create tags using custom fields on tickets.
    It adds a new custom field type, "Tags", which allows users to add new
    values (tags) that will then be added to the list of available
    autocomplete values for that custom field.

    The created tags become links to a search of all active tickets with
    that tag.

  Tag Custom Field
    The initdb step installs an example global Tag custom field.

RT VERSION
    Works with RT 4.0, 4.2, 4.4

INSTALLATION
    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make install
        May need root permissions

    make initdb
        This optional step installs an example global Tag custom field.

    Edit your /opt/rt4/etc/RT_SiteConfig.pm
        If you are using RT 4.2 or greater, add this line:

            Plugin('RT::Extension::Tags');

        For RT 4.0, add this line:

            Set(@Plugins, qw(RT::Extension::Tags));

        or add RT::Extension::Tags to your existing @Plugins line.

    Clear your mason cache
            rm -rf /opt/rt4/var/mason_data/obj

    Restart your webserver

  UPGRADING
    If you are upgrading from version 0.01 or 0.02, note that the custom
    field type was changed from a default RT "multiple values with
    autocompletion" to a dedicated tag custom field type. To upgrade:

    *   Change your Tag custom field to use the new tag custom field type

        You can either edit your existing custom field and change the Type
        to "Enter multiple tags" or run the initdb step and copy your values
        to the new Tag custom field automatically created.

    *   Disable the scrip "On Custom Field Change Add New Tag Values"

        This scrip is no longer needed with the new tag custom field type,
        so you can disable or delete it.
