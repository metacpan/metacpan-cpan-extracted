        # English

        my $number    = keys %$installed;

        print _('I know [quant,_1,language,languages]', $number);
        # I know 5 languages

        print set_language('fr','de_DE','en');

        get '/' => sub {

        };

DESCRIPTION
    Dancer::Plugin::Lexicon uses Locale::Maketext::Lexicon to provide I18N
    functionality to your Dancer application.

    Translations are stored in PO or MO (compiled PO) gettext files in the
    "languages/" dir. You can generate or update your PO files by
    automatically extracting translatable strings from your code and
    templates with xgettext.pl.

    It allows you to add language sub-classes which can handle grammatical
    differences in that language (such as the Polish example given in the
    "SYNOPSIS").

    The user's preferred language can be auto-detected from their browser
    settings, and the current language is automatically stored in the user's
    session. Including "lang=$lang_tag" in the query string change the
    user's language.

CONFIGURATION
  namespace
    The only required configuration is "namespace", which should be the base
    class in your application that you will use for I18N. The class itself
    doesn't have to exist, but will be loaded if it does exist:

        plugins:
            Lexicon:
                namespace:  MyApp::Lexicon

    See "LANGUAGE SUB-CLASSES" for more.

  path
    The "path" option (default "languages/") allows you to set a different
    path for where to find your PO files.

  default
    The default language to use. If not specifified, it defaults to "en".
    The language must exist in your "languages/" directory. If a translation
    doesn't exist in the current language, it will be translated using the
    default language instead.

  langs
    If not specified, then any PO files in your "languages/" directory will
    be loaded.

    Alternatively, you can specify a list of language tags:

        langs:
            en
            en_US
            pt
            pt_BR

    The name of each language will be derived from "name" in
    I18N::LangTags::List which provides the name in English.

    You can provide your own names as follows:

        langs:
            en:     English
            en_US:  US English
            de:     Deutsch
            it:     Italiano

    A PO file must exist for all listed languages.

  func
    One or more function names which will be exported to your modules and
    templates to localize text. For instance:

        func:   x

    Would allow you to do:

        x('Localize me')

    And:

        func:   [l, _]

    Would allow you to do:

        _('Localize me');
        l('Localize me');

  session_name
    The "session_name" param (default "lang") is the session key used to
    store the user's current language (if sessions are available).

  param_name
    The "param_name" param (default "lang") is the query string parameter
    used to change the user's current language.

  auto_detect
    If you don't want Dancer::Plugin::Lexicon to automatically detect the
    user's preferred language from their browser headers, then set:

        auto_detect: 0

FUNCTIONS
  set_language
    "set_language()" accepts a list of language tags, and chooses the best
    matching available language. For instance, if you have these languages
    available: 'en_GB','fr':

        set_language('en_US','en_AU');
        # British English

        set_language('it','de');
        # French (closer to Italian)

    If no suitable language is found, then it will set the default language,
    which you can also force with:

        set_language;

  language
    The name of the current language as specified in "installed_langs".

  language_tag
    The language tag of the current language.

  installed_langs
    A hashref containing all installed languages. The keys are language
    tags, and the values are the names as specified in your config, or as
    derived from "name" in I18N::LangTags::List.

  localize
    The "localize" function will translate the passed in phrase using the
    current language:

        localize('Translate me', @any_args);

    Also, and functions that you specify in "/func" will also be exported as
    aliases of "localize"

LANGUAGE SUB-CLASSES
    No ".pm" files need to exist, but if they do exist, they will be loaded
    and setup correctly.

    For instance, the class specified in "namespace" (eg "MyClass::Lexicon")
    is loaded or inflated, and setup to inherit from Locale::Maketext. If
    you load "fr.po" then it tries to load "MyClass::Lexicon::fr" if it
    exists, otherwise it inflates it. This class inherits from
    MyClass::Lexicon.

    If you want to override any functionality for a particular language,
    then you can create the file "lib/MyClass/Lexicon/fr.pm" and add your
    overrides in there.

    Also, you could have (eg) "MyClass::Lexicon::pt_br" (Brazilian
    Portuguese), which is a subclass of "MyClass::Lexicon::pt" (Portuguese).
    Any translations that aren't found in "pt_br.po" will be looked for in
    "pt.po", before finally failing over to the default language.
