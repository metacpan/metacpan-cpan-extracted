NAME
    Text::sprintfn - Drop-in replacement for sprintf(), with named parameter
    support

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.090 of Text::sprintfn (from Perl
    distribution Text-sprintfn), released on 2019-11-19.

SYNOPSIS
     use Text::sprintfn; # by default exports sprintfn() and printfn()

     # with no hash, behaves just like printf
     printfn '<%04d>', 1, 2; # <0001>

     # named parameter
     printfn '<%(v1)-4d>', {v1=>-2}; # <-2  >

     # mixed named and positional
     printfn '<%d> <%(v1)d> <%d>', {v1=>1}, 2, 3; # <2> <1> <3>

     # named width
     printfn "<%(v1)(v2).1f>", {v1=>3, v2=>4}; # <   3>

     # named precision
     printfn "<%(v1)(v2).(v2)f>", {v1=>3, v2=>4}; # <3.0000>

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides sprintfn() and printfn(), which are like sprintf()
    and printf(), with the exception that they support named parameters from
    a hash.

RATIONALE
    There exist other CPAN modules for string formatting with named
    parameter support. Two of such modules are String::Formatter and
    Text::Sprintf::Named. This module is far simpler to use and retains all
    of the features of Perl's sprintf() (which we like, or perhaps hate, but
    nevertheless are familiar with).

    String::Formatter requires you to create a new formatter function first.
    Text::Sprintf::Named also accordingly requires you to instantiate an
    object first. There is currently no way to mix named and positional
    parameters. And you don't get the full features of sprintf().

HOW IT WORKS
    Text::sprintfn works by converting the format string into sprintf
    format, i.e. replacing the named parameters like "%(foo)s" to something
    like "%11$s".

DOWNSIDES
    Currently the main downside is speed. "sprintfn()" is about 2-3 orders
    of magnitude slower than "sprintf()". See
    Bencher::Scenario::Textsprintfn for benchmarks.

TIPS AND TRICKS
  Common mistake 1
    Writing

     %(var)

    instead of

     %(var)s

  Common mistake 2 (a bit more newbish)
    Writing

     sprintfn $format, %hash, ...;

    instead of

     sprintfn $format, \%hash, ...;

  Alternative hashes
    You have several hashes (%h1, %h2, %h3) which should be consulted for
    values. You can either merge the hash first:

     %h = (%h1, %h2, %h3); # or use some hash merging module
     printfn $format, \%h, ...;

    or create a tied hash which can consult hashes for you:

     tie %h, 'Your::Module', \%h1, \%h2, \%h3;
     printfn $format, \%h, ...;

FUNCTIONS
  sprintfn $fmt, \%hash, ...
    If first argument after format is not a hash, sprintfn() will behave
    exactly like sprintf().

    If hash is given, sprintfn() will look for named parameters in argument
    and supply the values from the hash. Named parameters are surrounded
    with parentheses, i.e. "(NAME)". They can occur in format parameter
    index:

     %2$d        # sprintf version, take argument at index 2
     %(two)d     # $ is optional
     %(two)$d    # same

    or in width:

     %-10d       # sprintf version, use (minimum) width of 10
     %-(width)d  # like sprintf, but use width from hash key 'width'
     %(var)-(width)d  # format hash key 'var' with width from hash key 'width'

    or in precision:

     %6.2f       # sprintf version, use precision of 2 decimals
     %6.(prec)f  # like sprintf, but use precision from hash key 'prec'
     %(width).(prec)f
     %(var)(width).(prec)f

    The existence of formats using hash keys will not affect indexes of the
    rest of the argument, example:

     sprintfn "<%(v1)s> <%2$d> <%d>", {v1=>10}, 0, 1, 2; # "<10> <2> <0>"

    Like sprintf(), if format is unknown/erroneous, it will be printed
    as-is.

    There is currently no way to escape ")" in named parameter, e.g.:

     %(var containing ))s

  printfn $fmt, ...
    Equivalent to: print sprintfn($fmt, ...).
