         # this is the default build step, if you do not specify one.
         [ '%{cmake}', -G => '%{cmake_generator}', '-DCMAKE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE:BOOL=true', '-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=%{.install.prefix}', '.' ],

SEE ALSO

    Alien::Build::Plugin::Build::CMake

      Alien::Build plugin for cmake This will automatically pull in
      Alien::cmake3 if you need it.

    Alien::CMake

      This is an older distribution that provides an alienized cmake. It is
      different in these ways:

      Alien::cmake3 is based on alienfile and Alien::Build

	It integrates better with Aliens that are based on that technology.

      Alien::cmake3 will provide version 3.0.0 or better

	Alien::CMake will provide 2.x.x on some platforms where more recent
	binaries are not available.

      Alien::cmake3 will install on platforms where there is no system
      cmake and no binary cmake provided by cmake.org

	It does this by building cmake from source.

      Alien::cmake3 is preferred

	In the opinion of the maintainer of both Alien::cmake3 and
	Alien::CMake for these reasons.
