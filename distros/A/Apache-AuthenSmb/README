NAME
    Apache::AuthenSMB - mod_perl NT Authentication module

SYNOPSIS

    <Directory /foo/bar>
    # This is the standard authentication stuff
    AuthName "Foo Bar Authentication"
    AuthType Basic

    # Variables you need to set, you must set at least
    # the myPDC variable, the DOMAIN defaults to WORKGROUP
    PerlSetVar myPDC workgroup-pdc
    PerlSetVar myBDC workgroup-bdc
    PerlSetVar myDOMAIN WORKGROUP

    # Optional Variables
    PerlSetVar groupFile /path/to/htgroups
    # Set the format of the username to check against
    # defaults to username
    PerlSetVar authzUsername username or domain\username

    PerlAuthenHandler Apache::AuthenSmb

    # Standard require stuff, only user and
    # valid-user work currently
    require valid-user

    # Optional, reqires that you have Apache::Htgroup
    # require group groupname
    </Directory>

    These directives can be used in a .htaccess file as well.

    If you wish to use your own PerlAuthzHandler then the require
    directive should follow whatever handler you use.


DESCRIPTION
    This perl module is designed to work with mod_perl and the
    Authen::Smb module by Patrick Michael Kane (See CPAN). You need
    to set your PDC, BDC, and NT domain name for the script to
    function properly. You MUST set a PDC, if no BDC is set it
    defaults to the PDC, if no DOMAIN is set it defaults to
    WORKGROUP.

    Users can also specify the Windows Domain name along with the username
    when authenticating using the format: C<Domain\Username>. The Domain
    specified will override the domain name set in the myDOMAIN
    configuration setting.

    PerlSetVar myPDC

    Set to the FQDN or IP Address of your Primary Domain Controller

    PerlSetVar my BDC

    Set to the FQDN or IP Address of your Backup Domain Controller

    PerlSetVar myDOMAIN

    Set this to the Domain Name

    PerlSetVar groupFile

    Set this to the path of the htgroup file you wish this module
    to check in.  It allows you to specify your users in groups
    found on the web server, as opposed to groups within Active
    Directory, etc.

    PerlSetVar authzUsername

    Set this to "username" or "domain\username" depending on your preference.
    (This simply formats the input username to allowing checking the username
    as "domain\username" or "username".)  For example:

    # speeves is a DOMAIN user of DOMAIN
    domain\username =>  DOMAIN\speeves

    # speeves is a DOMAIN user of DOMAIN,
    # but the server administrator wants to
    # check this user against groups in the
    # htgroup file as:

    # groupname: speeves userA userB

    username => speeves

    If you allow users to use B<Domain\Username> and restrict access
    using the C<require user username> or C<require group groupname> make
    sure to set the username with the domain included. The authorization
    phase will be looking for C<Domain\Username> string.

    Example: require user mydomain\ramirezc

NOTE
    If you are using this module please let me know, I'm curious how
    many people there are that need this type of functionality.
