=head1 NAME

findsimilars - Fast similar-files finder

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  [perl -S] findsimilars [--level=1] [dirs...]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Similar-sized and similar-named files are picked as suspicious candidates of
duplicated files.

=head2 Basic Usage

Nothing descirbes better than actual outputs. Here is an example of suspicious
duplicated files:

  $ findsimilars -l 1 test
  ## =========
	     3 'CardLayoutTest.java' 'test/'
	     5 'TestLayout.java' 'test/'

  ## =========
	     4 'Python Standard Library.chm'              'test/'
	     4 'GNU - Python Standard Library (2001).chm' 'test/'
	     5 'GNU - 2001 - Python Standard Library.rar' 'test/'

The first column is the size of the file, 2nd the name, and 3rd the path.
L<findsimilars> will pick similar-sized and similar-named files as suspicious
candidates of duplicated files. Suspicious duplicated files are shown in
groups. The motto for the listing is that, I would rather the program
overkills (wrongly picking out suspicious ones) than neglects something that
would cause me otherwise years to notice.

By default, L<findsimilars> assumes that similar files within the B<same
folder> are OK. Hence you will not get duplicate warnings for generated
files (like .o, .class or .aux, and .dvi files) or other file series.

Once you are sure that there are no duplications across different folders
and want L<findsimilars> to scoop deeper and further into same folder,
specify the --level=1 command line switch (or -l 1). This is very good to
eliminate similar mp3 files within the same folder, or downloaded files from
big sites where different packaging methods are used, e.g.:

  ## =========
         66138 jdc-src.tar.gz  .../ftp.ora.com/published/oreilly/java/javadc
        147904 jdc-src.zip     .../ftp.ora.com/published/oreilly/java/javadc

=head2 Advanced Usages

The command line parameters can be a list of dir names or file names.

The command line parameter can also be a '-', a special case in which
file information is read from stdin: 

  find /path/you/want \( -type f -o -type l \) -follow -printf "%p\t%s\n" | findsimilars -

You can change the find (or L<findsimilars>) parameters; cache or filter the
find result, but the find output format has to be as shown.
