0.42     2017-11-04

- The Perl library claimed it provided types named LaxVersionStr and
  StrictVersionStr but they were really named LaxVersion and
  StrictVersion. The names have now been fixed to match the documentation, so
  they are LaxVersionStr and StrictVersionStr.


0.41     2017-11-04

- Fixed checks for whether a class is loaded in light of upcoming optimization
  in Perl 5.28. Fixed by Sprout (GH #12).


0.40     2017-08-03

- Fixed more bugs with {any,object}_{can,does,isa}_type. When passed a glob
  (not a globref) they would die in their type check. On Perl 5.16 or earlier,
  passing a number to an any_* type would also die.

- Fixed subification overloading. If Sub::Quote was loaded, this would be
  used, but any environment variables needed for the closure would not be
  included. This broke enums, among other things.


0.39     2017-08-02

- Many bug fixes and improves to the types created by
  {any,object}_{can,does,isa}_type. In some cases, an invalid value could
  cause an exception in type check itself. In other cases, a value which
  failed a type check would cause an exception when generating a message
  describing the failure. These cases have all been fixed.

- The messages describing a failure for all of these types have been improved.

- You can now create anonymous *_does and *_isa types using the exports from
  Specio::Declare.


0.38     2017-07-01

- Simplify checks for overloading to not call overload::Overloaded(). Just
  checking the return value of overload::Method() is sufficient.


0.37     2017-05-09

- Possible fix for very weird failures seen under threaded Perls with some
  modules that use Specio.


0.36     2017-02-19

- Inlined coercions would attempt to coerce for every type which matched the
  value given, instead of stopping after the first type. Fixed by Graham Knop
  (GH #11).

- Inlined coercions did not include the inline environment variables needed by
  the type from which the coercion was being performed. Fixed by Graham Knop
  (GH #8).

- When you use the same type repeatedly as coderef (for example, as a
  constraint with Moo), it will only generated its subified form once, rather
  than regenerating it each time it is de-referenced.

- Added an API to Specio::Subs to allow you to combine type libraries and
  helper subs in one package for exporting. See the Specio::Exporter docs for
  more details.


0.35     2017-02-12

- Added Specio::Subs, a module which allows you to turn one or more library's
  types into subroutines like is_Int() and to_Int().

- Added an inline_coercion method to Specio constraints.


0.34     2017-01-29

- Packages with Specio::Exporter as their parent can now specify additional
  arbitrary subs to exporter. See the Specio::Exporter docs for details.

- Importing the same library twice in a given package would throw an
  exception. The second attempt to import is now ignored.

- Added an alpha implementation of structured types. See
  Specio::Library::Structured for details.


0.33     2017-01-24

- Fixed a mistake in the SYNOPSIS for Specio::Declare. The example for the
  *_isa_type helpers was not correct.

- Removed the alpha warning from the docs. This is being used by enough of my
  modules on CPAN that I don't plan on doing any big breaking changes without
  a deprecation first.


0.32     2017-01-12

- Fixed a bug in the inlining for types create by any_can_type() and
  object_can_type(). This inlining mostly worked by accident because of some
  List::Util XS magic, but this broke under the debugger. Reported by
  Christian Walde (GH #6) and Chan Wilson
  (https://github.com/houseabsolute/DateTime.pm/issues/49).


0.31     2016-11-05

- The stack trace contained by Specio::Exception objects no longer includes a
  stack frames for the Specio::Exception package.

- Made the inline_environment() and description() methods public on type and
  coercion objects.


0.30     2016-10-15

- Fix a bug with the Sub::Quoted sub returned by $type->coercion_sub. If a
  type had more than one coercion, the generated sub could end up coercing the
  value to undef some of the time. Depending on hash key ordering, this could
  end up being a heisenbug that only occured some of the time.


0.29     2016-10-09

- Doc Specio::PartialDump because you may want to use it as part of the
  failure message generation code for a type.


0.28     2016-10-02

- Added a Test::Specio module to provide helpers for testing Specio libraries.

- Fixed another bug with a subtype of special types and inlining.


0.27     2016-10-01

- Cloning a type with coercions defined on it would cause an exception.

- Creating a subtype of a special type created by *_isa_type, *_can_type, or
  *_does_type, or enum would die when trying to inline the type constraint.

- Removed the never-documented Any type.

- Added documentation for each type in Specio::Library::Builtins.


0.26     2016-09-24

- Require Role::Tiny 1.003003. This should fix the test failures some
  CPANTesters reported with this error:

    Can't resolve method "???" overloading "&{}" in package
    "Specio::Constraint::Simple" at Specio::Constraint::Simple->new line 35.


0.25     2016-09-04

- Calling {any,object}_{isa,does}_type repeatedly in a package with the same
  class or role name would die. These subs are now special-cased to simply
  return an existing type for the given name when they receive a single
  argument (the name of the class or role). This could come up if you had two
  attributes both of which required an object of the same type.


0.24     2016-06-20

- Fix a bizarre failure on Perl before 5.14. AFAICT this was a test problem,
  not a library problem.


0.23     2016-06-20

- Added intersection types.


0.22     2016-06-18

- Require version.pm 0.83. I know 0.77 doesn't work but I'm not sure exactly
  which version fixed the problem, since I cannot install older
  versions. Reported by Slaven Rezic. RT #115418.


0.21     2016-06-18

- Don't load Sub::Quote, but use it if it's already loaded. Since Moo uses it,
  this should make Specio constraints just work with Moo.


0.20     2016-06-18

- Removed test dependency on namespace::autoclean.


0.19     2016-06-17

- Removed dependency on Devel::PartialDump by making a copy of just the bits
  we need. Gross but effective.


0.18     2016-06-15

- Added union types.

- If a subtype's parent could be inlined and the subtype itself did not
  specify any additional constraints (inlinable or not), then the subtype was
  not being inlined, even though it could be.

- This distro now works with Perl 5.8 (though it was only tested with 5.8.8).


0.17     2016-06-01

- Change "use v5.10" to "use 5.010". The former appears to cause warnings on
  older Perls.


0.16     2016-05-30

- Remove use of Class::Load and Module::Runtime.


0.15     2016-05-30

- The Num and Int type now accepts numbers in scientific notation such as 1e10
  or -1.2e-5.

- Removed various prereqs that weren't really needed.

- Added three new libraries, Specio::Library::String, ::Numeric, and
  ::Perl. These provide additional commonly used string and numeric types, as
  well as some types related to Perl syntax.


0.14     2016-05-22

- Added an inline_assert method for constraint objects. This makes certain
  types of inlining tasks easier.

- Parameterized constraint objects now have a default name based on the parent
  type and contained type.

- Rewrote the code used for inlined types so that the generated inline code is
  optimized to check the most common cases first.

- Fixed a bug where two enum types could not be inlined together in the same
  sub.


0.13     2016-05-15

- Parameterizing a type which generated inline parameterized constraints (like
  the ArrayRef and HashRef builtins) now dies if given a parameter which
  cannot itself be inlined. Mixing inlinable and non-inlinable constraints
  previously caused very confusing errors.


0.12     2015-12-19

- Fixed tests that failed if Moose wasn't installed. Reported by Karen
  Etheridge. RT #109247.


0.11     2014-05-27

- Remove a Perl 5.14-ism.


0.10     2014-05-26

- Added Class::Method::Modifiers to prereqs.

- Made Specio classes faster by inlining all accessors and constructors.

- Added support for Moo. Specio constraints now overloading sub-ification so
  you can pass them as "isa" values for Moo attributes. Also added a new
  $type->coercion_sub() method which returns a sub ref suitable for the
  "coerce" value. These all use Sub::Quote so that the returned sub refs can
  be inlined.


0.09     2014-05-25

- Reimplemented entirely without Moose. This module now implements its own
  half-assed (really, more like eighth-assed) OO system.

* TODO: Integrate cleanly with Moo and Moose.

* TODO: Improve the internal OO system to do some eighth-assed inlining so
  creating type objects is faster.


0.08     2013-06-08

- Removed the use of the encoding pragma from the tests. This pragma is
  deprecated in 5.18.


0.07     2013-03-03

- Disabled the tests that rely on an as-yet-unreleased Moose. These were
  mostly disabled but some cpan testers boxes were set up in a way that made
  them run.


0.06     2013-03-02

- Renamed Type to Specio.


0.05     2012-10-14

- This module didn't really need XS. It turns out that 5.10 added
  re::is_regexp() so we can use that instead. Thanks to Jesse Luehrs for
  pointing this out.


0.04     2012-09-30

- Added any_does_type and object_does_type declaration helpers. These check
  whether a class and/or object does a given role. They work with Moose,
  Mouse, and Role::Tiny.

- Fixed implementation of any_isa_type and object_isa_type to match docs. If
  given more than one argument, the docs said they expected named parameters
  but internally the code expected positional parameters.


0.03     2012-09-30

- Various hacks to make Specio::Constraint objects play nice with Moose. Needs
  changes to Moose to work properly, however.

- The message generator sub is no longer called as a method. It is called as a
  sub so it doesn't receive the type as an argument.

- The inline environment variable names used for each type are now
  unique. This means that types will not step on each other if you want to
  inline more than one type check in the same scope.

- Non-inlined type coercions were completely broken.

- Added $type->is_same_type_as and $type->is_a_type_of methods.

- The Maybe type was a subtype of Ref in the code, which is wrong. It is now a
  subtype of Item.

- This module now explicitly requires Perl 5.10.


0.02     2012-05-14

- Now with lots more documentation, but this is still very alpha. Feedback
  from potential users is welcome.


0.01     2012-05-13

- First release upon an unsuspecting world. This is very alpha and subject to
  change. I'm mostly releasing it to get some feedback on the design. Do not
  use this in your code yet, unless you promise not to complain about the lack
  of docs or the fact that the next release breaks your code.
