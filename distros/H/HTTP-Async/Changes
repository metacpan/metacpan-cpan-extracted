  * Created HTTP::Async::Polite that adds limits to the scraping to avoid over
    stretching the domain being scraped.

    machines.

  * Added pod tests, README and Makefile.PL in an attempt to achieve kwalitee.

  * Changed the timeout to be an inactivity timeout and added a
    max_request_length to limit the amount of time that a request can be
    running for.

  * Added more diagnostics to the tests to try to find the bug that is causing
    MIYAGAWA issues.

  * Created TODO and CHANGES docs.
