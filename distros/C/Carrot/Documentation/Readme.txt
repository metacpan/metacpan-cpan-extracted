This document applies to version 1.1.309 of Carrot, released 17th August 2014

Carrot gives you systematic expressiveness in the form of diversity,
modularity, and individuality. Technically the expressiveness relies
on controlled monadic growth. Global variables, file descriptors or
object oriented methods and attributes are the most common monads in
mainstream computer programs. But they're considered wild. Carrot
provides a systematic approach to control their growth through
providers. It leads to an extended understanding of Object
Orientation, among other things.

Carrot is a spin-off from a bigger application (which then became
smaller). If the preview of Carrot doesn't excite you, then wait for
the application which runs on top of Carrot.

This is an experimental module and in relation to its complexity there
are not enough tests available to consider it ready for general
production use, yet.
