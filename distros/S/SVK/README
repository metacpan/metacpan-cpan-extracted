This is the README file for SVK, a decentralized version control
system.

The latest version could be found at

    http://svn.bestpractical.com/svk/trunk

You need Module::Install if you are not installing from release tarballs.

* About

While Subversion aims to take over the CVS user base, SVK attempts
to take over the others -- including people who are already using
other SCM systems, and people who had not started using SCM.

SVK is written in Perl, using Subversion's underlying filesystem
but provides additional features:

 * Offline operations like "checkin", "log", "merge".
 * Distributed branches.
 * Lightweight checkout copy management (no ".svn" directories).
 * Advanced merge algorithms, like "star-merge" and "cherry picking".

For more information, please visit the web site at http://svk.bestpractical.com/.

* Installation

To use SVK, you need Subversion version 1.0.4 or higher, compiled with
Perl bindings support.

SVK uses the standard perl module install process:

% perl Makefile.PL
% make
# make install

* Usage

You may want to start with the SVK tutorial, available on the web site.
