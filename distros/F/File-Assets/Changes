0.060_6 Thursday June 12 13:08:32 PDT 2008:
 - Fixed some tests that were working but a little too tight

0.060_5 Wednesday June 11 11:02:00 PDT 2008:
 - Fixed a YUI Compressor test
 - Changed "minify 1" to "minify concat" in tests

0.060_4 Wednesday June 11 10:57:01 PDT 2008:
 - Took out JSON::XS reference that was killing tests

0.060_3 Tuesday June 10 14:51:55 PDT 2008:
 - Dropped the key digest and renamed content digest to fingerprint
 - Changed output path patterning and renamed/deprecated a bunch of directives
 - Streamlined File::Assets::Filter::Collect
 - Documented the output_path scheme
 - Made the output_path scheme easier to declare
 - This is better now: The interface is horrible, improve, improve, improve
 - Incorporate/allow external assets (e.g. http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.2.6/jquery.min.js)

0.060_2 Tuesday June 10 03:46:12 PDT 2008:
 - Improvements to the interface
 - Implemented automatic file content/file digesting caching
 - Incorporated *::Minifier::XS, but it's too buggy, so it's disabled for now

0.060_1 Thursday June 05 18:48:02 PDT 2008:
 - Marked $asset->content_digest as deprecated
 - Changed the name of Filter->digest to Filter->key_digest
 - Added %.?, %-?, %/? to output_path scheming
 - Got rid of %a, and %b in output_path scheming, these are now %l, and %-l
 - The output_path now includes %-d by default (good in the case of filter-built assets)
 - Remove HAML reference (meant SASS anyway)
 - Added a note about YUI Compressor version compatability

0.056 Saturday April 19 02:57:44 PDT 2008:
 - Bump for packaging error (*grumble* *grumble* META.yaml inc/ *grumble*)

0.055 Saturday March 29 22:57:47 PDT 2008:
 - Fixed a problem with inline content being escaped by HTML::Declare (thanks James Munson)
 - ->include and ->include_content can now accept simple HTML of the form <script>script> or
   <style></style>
 - Will not detect for rank/type misordering in ->include, ->include_path, and ->include_content
   It should just do-the-right-thing now.

0.051 Tuesday March 11 21:28:07 PDT 2008:
 - Fixed issue where HTML::Declare was using self-closing <script/> HTML, which 
   most browsers don't like (thanks patspam):

0.050 Sunday March 02 00:29:57 PST 2008:
 - Major "guts" rewrite. The interface is largely the same,
   but some heavy lifting had to be done to support different text/css media types.
 - Inline content is supported via ->include_content(...) or ->include(content => ...)
 - Passes through unrecognized attributes when generating HTML
 - Filters and output path selection is handled in a somewhat better (though not perfect, IMHO)
   fashion. Still need to write the documentation for this part.

0.032 Tuesday January 22 14:01:12 PST 2008:
 - Some minor tweaking of the timing of the caching test
