DESCRIPTION
    This module is mainly intended to strip the extra leading spaces which
    appear in text lines inside "<pre>...</pre>" blocks (corresponding to
    Pod *verbatim paragraphs*) in an HTML-transformed pod (then it can
    optionally apply other transformations as well on such blocks).

    perlpodspec states that (leading) *whitespace is significant in verbatim
    paragraphs*, that is, they must be preserved in the final output (e.g.
    HTML).

    This is an unfortunate mixture between syntax and semantics (which is
    really unavoidable, given the freedom perlpodspec leaves in choosing the
    verbatim paragraphs indentation width), which leads to (at least) a
    couple of annoying consequences:

    *   the code blocks are awful to see (at least in HTML, where those
        leading spaces have no meaning);

    *   the extra leading spaces can break the code (for example with
        non-*free form* code such as YAML, but it can even happen with plain
        Perl code - think of *heredocs*), so that, in the general case, the
        code cannot be taken verbatim from the document (for example by
        copying and pasting it into a text editor) and run without
        modifications.

    This module takes any document created by a Pod to HTML transformer and
    eliminates the extra leading spaces in *code blocks* (rendered in HTML
    as "<pre>...</pre>" blocks).

    Really, Pod::Simple already offers a sane solution to this problem
    (through its "strip_verbatim_indent" method), which has the advantage
    that it works with any final format.

    However it requires you to pass the leading string to strip, which, to
    work across different pods, of course requires the indentation of
    verbatim paragraphs to be consistent (which is very unlikely, if said
    pods come from many different authors). Alternatively, an heuristic to
    remove the extra indentation can be provided (through a code reference).

    Though much more limited in scope, since it works only on HTML, this
    module offers instead a ready-made simple but effective heuristic, which
    has proved to work on 100% of the HTML-rendered pods tested so far
    (including a large CPAN Search subset). For the details, please look at
    the "ALGORITHM" section below.

    Furthermore, since it works only on the final HTML (produced by any Pod
    transformer), it can more easily be integrated into existing workflows.

METHODS
  "new"
    *   "HTML::PodCodeReformat->new( %options )"

    *   "HTML::PodCodeReformat->new( \%options )"

    It creates and returns a new "HTML::PodCodeReformat" object. It accepts
    its options either as a hash or a hashref.

    It can take the following options:

    *   "squash_blank_lines"

        Boolean option which, when set to *true*, causes every line composed
        solely of spaces ("\s") in a "pre" block, to be *squashed* to an
        empty string (the newline is left untouched).

        When set to *false* (which is the default) the *blank lines* in a
        "pre" block will be treated as *normal* lines, that is, they will be
        stripped only of the extra leading whitespaces, as any other line.

    *   "line_numbers"

        Boolean option which, when set to true, causes every line in a "pre"
        text to be wrapped in "<li>...</li>" tags, and the whole text to be
        wrapped in "<ol>...</ol>" tags (so that a line number is prepended
        to every line in the "pre" text, when the HTML document is viewed in
        a browser).

        In this case the original newlines in the "pre" text are removed, to
        not add extra empty lines when the HTML document is rendered.

        It defaults to false.

    The above options can be read/set after the object construnction through
    their corresponding methods as well.

  "reformat_pre"
    *   "reformat_pre( $filename )"

    *   "reformat_pre( $filehandle )"

    *   "reformat_pre( \$string )"

    Instance method which removes the *extra* leading spaces from the lines
    contained in every "<pre>...</pre>" block in the given HTML document (of
    course preserving any *real* indentation *inside* code, as showed in the
    "SYNOPSIS" above), and returns a string containing the HTML code
    modified that way.

    It can take the name of the HTML file, an already opened filehandle or a
    reference to a string containing the HTML code.

    It would work even on nested "pre" blocks, though this situation has
    never been encountered in *real* pods.

    If the options "squash_blank_lines" and "line_numbers" are set, the
    corresponding transformations (described above) are applied as well
    (after the extra leading spaces removal).

ALGORITHM
    The adopted algorithm to remove the extra leading whitespaces is
    extremely simple.

    Skipping some minor details, it basically works this way: given an HTML
    document, for each text block inside "<pre>...</pre>" tags, first the
    length of the shortest leading whitespace string across all the lines in
    the block is calculated (ignoring empty lines), then every line in the
    block is *shifted to the left* by such amount.

LIMITATIONS
    With the exception explained below in the "Non-limitations" section, any
    "<pre>...</pre>" block which has *extra* leading spaces will be
    reformatted. This will happen also if a given verbatim paragraph (most
    probably composed of text, not code) is intended to stay indented (no
    pun intended) that way, such as in, for example:

            This text
            should really stay
            8-spaces indented
            (but it will be shifted to the first column :-(

    Currently there is no way to *protect* a "pre" block, but such
    requirement should be really rare.

  Non-limitations
    *   Really, perlpodspec says that indenting only the first line it is
        sufficient to qualify a verbatim paragraph. But this seems not to be
        used by any author (at least not for *real* code), and it's even not
        fully honoured by some Pod parsers.

        Furthermore, the only time I've found such a situation, it was
        *text* (not code) meant to really remain indented that way. Since
        you asked, it was the following block:

                                   columns
        <------------------------------------------------------------>
        <----------><------><---------------------------><----------->
         leftMargin  indent  text is formatted into here  rightMargin

        from Text::Format.

        That's why such blocks will be left unaltered, and that's why it's
        more an advantage than a limitation (hopefully).

    *   Working only on "pre" tags may seem a limitation, but this is the
        way any Pod to HTML transformer I'm aware of renders a Pod verbatim
        paragraph in HTML.
