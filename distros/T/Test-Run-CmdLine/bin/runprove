=head1 NAME

runprove -- A command-line tool for running tests against Test::Run

=head1 SYNOPSIS

runprove [options] [files/directories]

Options:

    -b, --blib      Adds blib/lib to the path for your tests, a la "use blib".
    -d, --debug     Includes extra debugging information.
    -D, --dry       Dry run: Show the tests to run, but don't run them.
        --ext=x     Extensions (defaults to .t)
    -h, --help      Display this help
    -H, --man       Longer manpage for runprove
    -I              Add libraries to @INC, as Perl's -I
    -l, --lib       Add lib to the path for your tests.
    -r, --recurse   Recursively descend into directories.
    -s, --shuffle   Run the tests in a random order.
    -T              Enable tainting checks
    -t              Enable tainting warnings
        --timer     Print elapsed time after each test file
    -v, --verbose   Display standard output of test scripts while running them.
    -V, --version   Display version info

Single-character options may be stacked.  Default options may be set by
specifying the PROVE_SWITCHES environment variable.

=head1 OVERVIEW

F<runprove> is a command-line interface to the test-running functionality
of C<Test::Run>.  With no arguments, it will run all tests in the
current directory.

Shell metacharacters may be used with command lines options and will be exanded
via C<glob>.

=head1 RUNPROVE VS. "MAKE TEST"

F<runprove> has a number of advantages over C<make test> when doing development.

=over 4

=item * F<runprove> is designed as a development tool

Perl users typically run the test harness through a makefile via
C<make test>.  That's fine for module distributions, but it's
suboptimal for a test/code/debug development cycle.

=item * F<runprove> is granular

F<runprove> let your run only the files you want to check.
Running C<runprove t/live/ t/master.t> checks every F<*.t> in F<t/live>,
plus F<t/master.t>.

=item * F<prove> has an easy verbose mode

F<runprove> has a C<-v> option to see the raw output from the tests.
To do this with C<make test>, you must set C<HARNESS_VERBOSE=1> in
the environment.

=item * F<runprove> can run under taint mode

F<runprove>'s C<-T> runs your tests under C<perl -T>, and C<-t> runs them
under C<perl -t>.

=item * F<runprove> can shuffle tests

You can use F<runprove>'s C<--shuffle> option to try to excite problems
that don't show up when tests are run in the same order every time.

=item * F<runprove> doesn't rely on a make tool

Not everyone wants to write a makefile, or use L<ExtUtils::MakeMaker>
to do so.  F<runprove> has no external dependencies.

=item * Not everything is a module

More and more users are using Perl's testing tools outside the
context of a module distribution, and may not even use a makefile
at all.

=head1 COMMAND LINE OPTIONS

=head2 -b, --blib

Adds blib/lib to the path for your tests, a la "use blib".

=head2 -d, --debug

Include debug information about how F<runprove> is being run.  This
option doesn't show the output from the test scripts.  That's handled
by -v,--verbose.

=head2 -D, --dry

Dry run: Show the tests to run, but don't run them.

=head2 --ext=extension

Specify extensions of the test files to run.  By default, these are .t,
but you may have other non-.t test files, most likely .sh shell scripts.
The --ext is repeatable.

=head2 -I

Add libraries to @INC, as Perl's -I.

=head2 -l, --lib

Add C<lib> to @INC.  Equivalent to C<-Ilib>.

=head2 -r, --recurse

Descends into subdirectories of any directories specified, looking for tests.

=head2 -s, --shuffle

Sometimes tests are accidentally dependent on tests that have been
run before.  This switch will shuffle the tests to be run prior to
running them, thus ensuring that hidden dependencies in the test
order are likely to be revealed.  The author hopes the run the
algorithm on the preceding sentence to see if he can produce something
slightly less awkward.

=head2 -t

Runs test programs under perl's -t taint warning mode.

=head2 -T

Runs test programs under perl's -T taint mode.

=head2 --timer

Print elapsed time after each test file

=head2 -v, --verbose

Display standard output of test scripts while running them.  Also sets
TEST_VERBOSE in case your tests rely on them.

=head2 -V, --version

Display version info.

=head1 BUGS

Please report any bugs or feature requests to
C<bug-test-run-cmdline@rt.cpan.org>, or through the web interface at
L<http://rt.cpan.org/NoAuth/ReportBug.html?Queue=Test-Run-CmdLine>.
I will be notified, and then you'll automatically be notified of progress on
your bug as I make changes.

=head1 TODO

=over 4

=item *

Shuffled tests must be recreatable
