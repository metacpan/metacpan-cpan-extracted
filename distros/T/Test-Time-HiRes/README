        use Test::Time::HiRes time => 123.456789;
    
        # Freeze time
        my $now       = time();
        my $now_hires = Time::HiRes::time();
    
        # Increment internal time (returns immediately)
        sleep 1;        # seconds
        usleep 1000;    # microseconds
    
        # Return internal time incremented by 1.001s
        my $then       = time();
        my $then_hires = Time::HiRes::time();
    
        # set/reset time
        Test::Time::HiRes->set_time( 123.456789 );
    
        Test::Time::HiRes->unimport(); # turn off behaviour

DESCRIPTION
