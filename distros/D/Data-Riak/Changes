2.0  2013-04-03

  - Remove leftovers of Data::Riak::Result::WithVClock. It's been replaced by
    Data::Riak::Result::MaybeWithVClock in an earlier release. This makes this
    distribution installable again if you didn't have an older version of
    Data-Riak that still contained ::WithVClock installed before.

1.9  2013-02-21

  - Allow passing extra arguments to AnyEvent::HTTP when using the
    Async::HTTP transport

1.8  2013-02-21

  - Add an experimental and undocumented asynchronous API

1.7  2013-02-06

  - Bump dependency on Throwable::Error to fix warnings that showed
    up when using older versions

1.6  2013-02-06

  - Allow HTTP request header generation to depend on other request
    instance attributes

1.5  2013-02-05

  - Make HTTP request construction more pluggable

1.4  2013-02-05

  - Fix Test::Data::Riak's import method to allow both overriding of
    transport defaults and using all Sub::Exporter features.

1.3  2013-02-05

  - Fix flaking tests by giving Riak more time to finish processing the
    requests sent
  - Deal gracefully with RemoveObject requests returning results without
    a VClock

1.2  2013-02-04

  - This release contains a lot of new features and various refactorings that
    make it not fully backward compatible with earlier versions of Data::Riak.

  - Add structured exceptions
  - Add set_props to set bucket properties
  - Remove Bucket->indexing as it never actually worked
  - Handle vector clocks
  - Deprecate $result->sync in void context
  - Make ResultSets and Results immutable
  - Add experimental HTTPS support
  - Deprecate default host and port
  - Add save_unless_modified allowing conflict handling
