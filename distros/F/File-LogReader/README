File::LogReader - tail log files with state between runs

Tail log files across multiple runs over time.

    use File::LogReader;

    my $lr = File::LogReader->new( filename => $filename );
    while( my $line = $lr->read_line ) {
        # do stuff with $line
    }
    $lr->commit;

This module makes it easy to periodically check a file for new content
and act on it.  For instance, you may want to parse a log file whenever
it is updated.


The code is kept in a git repository at:
