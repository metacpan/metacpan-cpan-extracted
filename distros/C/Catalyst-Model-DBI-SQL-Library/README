DESCRIPTION
    This is the "SQL::Library" model class. It provides access to
    "SQL::Library" via sql accessor. Additional caching options are provided
    for increased performance via sqlcache and sqlcache_use_mtime, these
    options can only be used when sql strings are stored within a file and
    loaded by using a scalar value passed to load. The load and parse phase
    is then bypassed if cached version of the file is found.

    The use of these options can result in more memory being used but faster
    access to query data when running under persistent environment such as
    mod_perl or FastCGI. When sqlcache_use_mtime is in use, last
    modification time of the file is being referenced upon every cache
    check. If the modification time has changed only then query file is
    re-loaded. This should be much faster then re-creating the SQL::Library
    instance on every load. Please refer to the "SQL::Library" for more
    information.

METHODS
    new Initializes database connection

    $self->load
        Initializes "SQL::Library" instance

    $self->dbh
        Returns the current database handle.

    $self->sql
        Returns the current "SQL::Library" instance
