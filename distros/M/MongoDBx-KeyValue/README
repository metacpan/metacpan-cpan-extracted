NAME
    MongoDBx::KeyValue - Use MongoDB as if it were a key-value store.

VERSION
    version 0.001001

SYNOPSIS
            use MongoDBx::KeyValue;

            my $mkv = MongoDBx::KeyValue->new(kvdb => 'my_key_value_database', %opts);
                    # 'kvdb' is required, other options are passed to MongoDB::Connection->new()

            $mkv->set('cache', 'index.html', '<html><head><title>Index</title></head><body>Index</body></html>');

            my $index = $mkv->get('cache', 'index.html');
            print $index; # prints '<html><head><title>Index</title></head><body>Index</body></html>'

DESCRIPTION
    MongoDBx::KeyValue is a very simple module for easy usage of MongoDB as
    a key-value store (similar to Redis, Riak or Memcached).

    The interface is very simple: you *set* the values of keys and *get* the
    values of keys. Every key-value pair is stored in a bucket, which is
    really just a MongoDB collection (the "bucket" terminology is used
    merely for resemblance with other key-value stores), so the same key can
    exist, with possibly different values, in multiple buckets.

    To get the value of a key, just pass the "get()" method the name of the
    bucket and the key. If it is not found, "undef" is returned. To set the
    value for a key, just provide the "set()" method with the name of the
    bucket, the key and the value. If the key already exists in the bucket,
    its value will be replaced.

    The value for a key can be anything that MongoDB supports, including
    simple scalars (strings, numbers, etc.), hash or array references, and
    whatever else MongoDB natively supports such as DateTime objects. While
    no checking is made for keys, you probably should only use scalars for
    them.

    Every key-value pair is stored in the database as a document with two
    attributes: "_id", which holds the key; and "value", which holds the
    value.

CLASS METHODS
  new( %opts )
    Creates a new instance of this module and connects to the MongoDB
    server. The only required option is 'kvdb', which should hold the name
    of the database to use for the key-value store. All other options will
    be passed to "MongoDB::Connection->new()", so take a look at
    "ATTRIBUTES" in MongoDB::Connection for a list of all supported options.

OBJECT METHODS
  get( $bucket, $key )
    Attempts to find the value for the key $key in the bucket named $bucket.
    Returns "undef" if not found.

  set( $bucket, $key, $value )
    Sets the value for the key named $key inside the bucket named $bucket.
    If the key already exists, its value will be replaced with the new one.

    It's probably better for keys to be scalars, but values can be anything,
    including hash-refs, array-refs and whatever MongoDB can store natively
    (take a look at MongoDB::DataTypes for more info).

  db()
    Returns the MongoDB::Database object of the key-value store.

  bucket( $bucket_name )
    All this really does is return a MongoDB::Collection object for the
    collection named $bucket_name. Use it if you need MongoDB collection
    objects for some reason.

DIAGNOSTICS
    This module generates the following errors:

    *   "You must provide the name of the key-value database to use (as
        parameter 'kvdb')."

        This error will be issued by the "new()" method if you don't provide
        it with the 'kvdb' parameter, which should hold the name of the
        database to use as the key-value store.

DEPENDENCIES
    This module only depends on MongoDB.

INCOMPATIBILITIES
    None reported.
