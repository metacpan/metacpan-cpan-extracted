NAME
    Module::Patch - Patch package with a set of patches

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.26 of Module::Patch (from Perl
    distribution Module-Patch), released on 2017-08-09.

SYNOPSIS
    To use Module::Patch directly:

     # patching DBI modules so that calls are logged

     use Module::Patch qw(patch_package);
     use Log::ger;
     my $handle = patch_package(['DBI', 'DBI::st', 'DBI::db'], [
         {action=>'wrap', mod_version=>':all', sub_name=>':public', code=>sub {
             my $ctx = shift;

             log_trace("Entering %s(%s) ...", $ctx->{orig_name}, \@_);
             my $res;
             if (wantarray) { $res=[$ctx->{orig}->(@_)] } else { $res=$ctx->{orig}->(@_) }
             log_trace("Returned from %s", $ctx->{orig_name});
             if (wantarray) { return @$res } else { return $res }
         }},
     ]);

     # restore original
     undef $handle;

    To create a patch module by subclassing Module::Patch:

     # in your patch module

     package Some::Module::Patch::YourCategory;
     use parent qw(Module::Patch);

     sub patch_data {
         return {
             v => 3,
             patches => [...], # $patches_spec
             config => { # per-patch-module config
                 a => {
                     default => 1,
                 },
                 b => {},
                 c => {
                     default => 3,
                 },
             },
         };
     }
     1;

     # using your patch module

     use Some::Module::Patch::YourCategory
         -force => 1, # optional, force patch even if target version does not match
         -config => {a=>10, b=>20}, # optional, set config value
     ;

     # accessing per-patch-module config data

     print $Some::Module::Patch::YourCategory::config->{a}; # 10
     print $Some::Module::Patch::YourCategory::config->{c}; # 3, default value

     # unpatch, restore original subroutines
     no Some::Module::Patch::YourCategory;

DESCRIPTION
    Module::Patch is basically a convenient way to define and bundle a set
    of patches. Actual patching is done by Monkey::Patch::Action, which
    provides lexically scoped patching.

    There are two ways to use this module:

    *   subclass it

        This is used for convenient bundling of patches. You create a *patch
        module* (a module that monkey-patches other module by
        adding/replacing/wrapping/deleting subroutines of target module) by
        subclassing Module::Patch and providing the patches specification in
        patch_data() method.

        Patch module should be named *Some::Module*::Patch::*YourCategory*.
        *YourCategory* should be a keyword or phrase (verb + obj) that
        describes what the patch does. For example,
        HTTP::Daemon::Patch::IPv6, LWP::UserAgent::Patch::LogResponse.

        Patch module should be use()'d, or require()'d + import()'ed instead
        of just require()'d, because the patching is done in import().

    *   require/import it directly

        Module::Patch provides patch_package which is the actual routine to
        do the patching.

PATCH DATA SPECIFICATION
    Patch data must be stored in "patch_data()" subroutine. It must be a
    DefHash (i.e. a regular Perl hash) with the following known properties:

    *   v => int

        Must be 3 (current version).

    *   patches => array

        Will be passed to "patch_package()".

    *   config => hash

        A hash of name and config specifications. Config specification is
        another DefHash and can contain the following properties: "schema"
        (a Sah schema), "default" (default value).

    *   after_read_config => coderef

        A hook to run after patch module is imported and configuration has
        been read.

    *   before_patch => coderef

    *   after_patch => coderef

    *   before_unpatch => coderef

    *   after_unpatch => coderef

FUNCTIONS
  import()
    If imported directly, will export @exports as arguments and export
    requested symbols.

    If imported from subclass, will take %opts as arguments and run
    patch_package() on caller package. %opts include:

    *   -load_target => BOOL (default 1)

        Load target modules. Set to 0 if package is already defined in other
        files and cannot be require()-ed.

    *   -warn_target_loaded => BOOL (default 1)

        If set to false, do not warn if target modules are loaded before the
        patch module. By default, it warns to prevent users making the
        mistake of importing subroutines from target modules before they are
        patched.

    *   -force => BOOL

        Will be passed to patch_package's \%opts.

  patch_package($package, $patches_spec, \%opts) => HANDLE
    Patch target package $package with a set of patches.

    $patches_spec is an arrayref containing a series of patches
    specifications. Each patch specification is a hashref containing these
    keys: "action" (string, required; either 'wrap', 'add', 'replace',
    'add_or_replace', 'delete'), "mod_version" (string/regex or array of
    string/regex, can be ':all' to mean all versions; optional; defaults to
    ':all'). "sub_name" (string/regex or array of string/regex,
    subroutine(s) to patch, can be ':all' to mean all subroutine, ':public'
    to mean all public subroutines [those not prefixed by "_"], ':private'
    to mean all private), "code" (coderef, not required if "action" is
    'delete').

    Die if there is conflict with other patch modules, for example if target
    module has been patched 'delete' and another patch wants to 'wrap' it.

    Known options:

    *   force => BOOL (default 0)

        Force patching even if target module version does not match. The
        default is to warn and skip patching.

FAQ
  This module does not work! The target module does not get patched!
    It probably does. Some of the common mistakes are:

    *   Not storing the handle

        You do this:

         patch_package(...);

        instead of this:

         my $handle = patch_package(...);

        Since the handle is used to revert the patch, if you do not store
        $handle, you are basically patching and immediately reverting the
        patch.

    *   Importing before patching

        If "Target::Module" exports symbols, and you patch one of the
        default exports, the users need to patch before importing. Otherwise
        he/she will get the unpatched version. For example, this won't work:

         use Target::Module; # by default export foo
         use Target::Module::Patch::Foo; # patches foo

         foo(); # user gets the unpatched version

        While this does:

         use Target::Module::Patch::Foo; # patches foo
         use Target::Module; # by default export foo

         foo(); # user gets the patched version

        Since 0.16, Module::Patch already warns this (unless "-load_target"
        or "-warn_target_loaded" is set to false).
