CONFIGURATION
    An example configuration file is provided in etc/RT_AI_Config.pm. The
    configuration defines both the details of the service you want to
    connect to and details of the specific features, like prompts for
    different features.

    Here is a sample configuration with Gemini:

        Set( %RT_AI_Provider,
              'Default' => {
                 name    => 'Gemini',
                 api_key => 'YOUR_API_KEY',
                 timeout => 15,
                 url     => 'https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-2.0-flash:generateContent',
                 prompts => {
                    summarize_ticket => 'You are a helpdesk assistant. Summarize the ticket conversation precisely. Focus on key points, decisions made, and any follow-up actions required.',
                    assess_sentiment => 'Classify the overall sentiment as Satisfied, Dissatisfied, or Neutral. Provide reasoning if possible.',
                    adjust_tone => 'Paraphrase the text for clarity and professionalism. Ensure the tone is polite, concise, and customer-friendly.',
                    suggest_response => 'Provide clear, practical advice or suggestions based on the given question or scenario.',
                    translate_content => 'Translate the provided text, maintaining accuracy and idiomatic expressions.',
                    autocomplete_text => 'Predict the next three words based on the input text without explanations.',
                 },
                 editor_features => [ 'adjust_tone', 'suggest_response', 'translate_content', 'autocomplete_text' ],
              },
        );

    Below shows a sample configuration with OpenAI:

        Set( %RT_AI_Provider,
              'Default' => {
                name    => 'OpenAI',
                api_key => 'YOUR_API_KEY',
                timeout => 15,
                url     => 'https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions',
                default_model => {
                    name        => 'gpt-4',
                    max_tokens  => 300,
                    temperature => 0.5,
                },
                autocomplete_model => {
                    name        => 'gpt-3.5-turbo',
                    max_tokens  => 20,
                    temperature => 0.7,
                },
                prompts => {
                    summarize_ticket => 'You are a helpdesk assistant. Summarize the ticket conversation precisely. Focus on key points, decisions made, and any follow-up actions required.',
                    assess_sentiment => 'Classify the overall sentiment as Satisfied, Dissatisfied, or Neutral. Provide reasoning if possible.',
                    adjust_tone => 'Paraphrase the text for clarity and professionalism. Ensure the tone is polite, concise, and customer-friendly.',
                    suggest_response => 'Provide clear, practical advice or suggestions based on the given question or scenario.',
                    translate_content => 'Translate the provided text, maintaining accuracy and idiomatic expressions.',
                    autocomplete_text => 'Predict the next three words based on the input text without explanations.',
                },
                editor_features => [ 'adjust_tone', 'suggest_response', 'translate_content', 'autocomplete_text' ],
              },
        );

  Global and Queue-specific Configuration
    The block of configuration defined for the "Default" key, as shown
    above, is used as the default global settings for your RT. You can
    define per-queue configuration by adding sections with queue names as
    keys. In any context where RT can associate the AI action with a ticket
    or queue, it will load the matching queue configuration, if available.

    Some features, like the editor autocomplete, may call the AI service
    many times. To limit AI features to selected queues only, do not provide
    a Default configuration and only add configuration for the queues you
    want. The AI menu in the editor will only appear for configured queues
    and autocomplete will also run only for configured queues.

  Using Different AI Providers
    This extension is designed to work with any AI provider with a REST API.
    The features currently all use the conversation AI feature. To interface
    with a system, you need the REST API URL for the conversation endpoint.

    Authentication can be different for different providers and may require
    some custom coding. Most require a token as indicated in the
    configuration. We have tested with the following providers.

    *   OpenAPI, URL: https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions

    *   Gemini, URL:
        https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-2.0-f
        lash:generateContent

  Models
    Some API providers have different models that are optimized for
    different tasks. Currently most AI features use the general model. The
    autocomplete feature, however, requires fast responses, so we provide a
    way to set a different model for that feature. ChatGPT, for example, has
    a turbo model that is optimized for speed and makes the autocomplete
    work much better.

  Prompts
    You can define different prompts for different AI features. The keys in
    the prompts section describe what they are used for. These prompts are
    sent with every request to the AI for the defined feature. You will
    likely need to experiment with your selected AI to find wording that
    correctly processes the prompt along with the content sent in each
    request.

  CKEditor Integration
    Some AI features are integrated into RT's editor and are accessible via
    buttons in the editor toolbar. To load the editor features, some
    additional configuration is needed. It is provided in the sample
    etc/RT_AI_Config.pm file and should be loaded automatically when you
    enable the extension. If you don't see the AI button, you can copy the
    configuration into your local site configuration.

FEATURES
  Scrips
    The following scrips are provided to update information on tickets when
    configured with whatever conditions you prefer. The sample scrips are
    configured with "On Correspond" conditions. These are just examples and
    you can use the actions in any new scrips you want to create.

    These scrips are applied globally as part of the installation. If you
    are just testing, you may want to update the scrips and limit them to
    just one queue.

    On Correspond Summarize Ticket History
    On Correspond Assess Reply Sentiment

   Scrip Actions
    The actions below are included with the extension and can be used with
    any conditions to create scrips that make sense for your system.

    Analyze Ticket Sentiment
        Content from the ticket is sent to the AI provider and analyzed to
        assess the sentiment of the end user. Responses are Satisfied,
        Dissatisfied, or Neutral and the value is saved in the "Ticket
        Summary" custom field on the ticket.

    Generate Ticket Summary
        Content from the ticket is sent to the AI provider and a concise
        summary is requested. The result is saved in the "Ticket Sentiment"
        custom field on the ticket.

  Editor Features
    The following features are available in RT's editor.

    Autocomplete
        As you type, suggestions are provided for the next few words. The
        behavior of the suggestions can be modified with the prompt.

    Adjust Tone
        You can submit a block of text to your AI provider and ask it to
        change the tone to something different.

    AI Suggestion
        Your AI provider can suggest a response to the current question on
        the ticket.

    Translate
        Translate the provided content from the current language to another
        selected language.

DEVELOPER
  CKEditor Plugin RtExtensionAi
    A new custom CKEditor plugin RtExtensionAi provides the AI integration
    with the RT editor.

  Updating the plugin
    The plugin uses Vite to build the assets loaded into RT. Information on
    working with CKEditor plugins can be found on the CKEditor website
    <https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/framework/tutorials/creating
    -simple-plugin-timestamp.html>.

    We use Vite to build the CKEditor plugin.

        npm install
        npm run build
