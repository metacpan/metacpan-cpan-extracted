=head1 NAME

markdent-html - Turn Markdown into HTML with Markdent

=head1 VERSION

version 0.34

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    $> markdent-html --file ./path/to/text.md

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This tool turns Markdown into HTML using L<Markdent>.

=head1 OPTIONS

This tool accepts the following command line options:

=head2 --file

The file containing the Markdown to process. You must provide this or
C<--text>, but not both.

=head2 --text

The Markdown text to process. You must provide this or C<--file>, but not
both.

=head2 --title

If you pass then the output will be a full HTML document containing this as
the C<< <title> >> tag. If this isn't passed then the output will be a HTML
fragment with no C<< <html> >> or C<< <body> >> tags.

=head2 --charset

If you pass with a C<--title> it will be used to populate a C<< <meta
charset="..."> >> tag for the document.

=head2 --language

If you pass with a C<--title> it will be used to set the C<lang> attribute for
the document's C<< <html> >> tag.

=head2 --dialects

You can add one or more dialects to the standard parser with this option. This
can either be a full class name like C<Markdent::Dialect::GitHub> or just a
short name like C<GitHub>.
