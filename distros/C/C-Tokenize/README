This is the README for C::Tokenize version 0.18.

C::Tokenize is a "module" for the Perl computer programming language, a
library of computer code to install on a computer.  This document contains
four sections:

1. About - what the module does

2. Documentation - how to learn more about the module

3. Installation - how to install this module on a computer

4. Help - what to do if you get stuck

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. ABOUT

C::Tokenize - reduce a C file to a series of tokens

This module provides a tokenizer, "tokenize", which breaks C source
code into its smallest meaningful components, and the regexes which
match each of these components. For example, "$comment_re" matches a
C comment.

As well as components of C, it supplies regexes for local include
statements, "$include_local", and C variables, "$cvar_re", as well
as extra functions, like "decomment" to remove the comment syntax of
traditional C comments, and "strip_comments", which removes all
comments from a C program.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. DOCUMENTATION

You can read the documentation for the module online at the following
websites:

    * http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?C::Tokenize
    * http://metacpan.org/release/C-Tokenize

(These links go to the latest version of the module.)

After installing the module, you can read the documentation on your
computer using

    perldoc C::Tokenize

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. INSTALLATION

This module requires Perl version 5.10.1 or later.

To install the module from CPAN, use

    cpan C::Tokenize

If you have the App::cpanminus installer, you may prefer

    cpanm C::Tokenize

To install the module from the source file, C-Tokenize-0.18.tar.gz, follow
this sequence of commands:

    tar xfz C-Tokenize-0.18.tar.gz
    cd C-Tokenize-0.18
    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make install

If you want to test the module before installing it, use "make test" after
"make" and before "make install".
