Gnome2::GConf version 1.044
===========================

This module allows you to use the GConf configuration system in order to
store/retrieve the configuration of an application.  GConf is a powerful
configuration manager based on a user daemon that handles a set of key and
value pairs, and notifies any changes of the value to every program that
monitors those keys.  GConf is used by GNOME 2.x.


INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install


To avoid installing to a system directory, since this is a beta release,
you can change the installation prefix at Makefile.PL time with

   perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/some/other/place

This will install the module to the subdirectory lib/perl5 under the given
prefix.  If this is not already in perl's include path, you'll need to tell
perl how to get to this library directory so you can use it; there are three
ways:

  in your environment (the easiest):
    PERL5LIB=/some/other/place/lib/perl5/site_perl:$PERL5LIB

  on the perl command line:
    perl -I /some/other/place/lib/perl5/site_perl yourscript

  in the code of your perl script:
    use lib '/some/other/place/lib/perl5/site_perl';
