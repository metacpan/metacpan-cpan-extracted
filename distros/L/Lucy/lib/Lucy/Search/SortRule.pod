=head1 NAME

Lucy::Search::SortRule - Element of a SortSpec.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $sort_spec = Lucy::Search::SortSpec->new(
        rules => [
            Lucy::Search::SortRule->new( field => 'date' ),
            Lucy::Search::SortRule->new( type  => 'doc_id' ),
        ],
    );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

SortRules are the building blocks used to assemble
L<SortSpecs|Lucy::Search::SortSpec>; each SortRule defines a single
level of sorting.  For example, sorting first by “category” then by score
requires a SortSpec with two SortRule elements.
