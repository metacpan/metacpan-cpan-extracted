This is a demo program.  It contains a small english polish dictionary..
very small.  Interesting words include (in english):-

	car
	fog
	I

From which you should be able to find most of the rest (try translating car
with

	transword.pl english car

then translate the result with 

	transword.pl polish <result>

P.S. It will no doubt annoy my Polish friends and associates, but I've cut out
the 8-bit accent characters in this, so mgla should actually be mg\la in TeX
notation.
