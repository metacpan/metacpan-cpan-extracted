Net-Payment-CCAvenue-NonSeamless

The README is used to introduce the module and provide instructions on
how to install the module, any machine dependencies it may have (for
example C compilers and installed libraries) and any other information
that should be provided before the module is installed.

A README file is required for CPAN modules since CPAN extracts the README
file from a module distribution so that people browsing the archive
can use it to get an idea of the module's uses. It is usually a good idea
to provide version information here so that people can decide whether
fixes for the module are worth downloading.


INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install

    );
    
    # Get NonSeamless integration form
    $foo->payment_form();

    # Above method returns html form and your need to render this and click on pay button to start payment.

    my $handle_response = Net::Payment::CCAvenue::NonSeamless::Response->new(
        encryption_key => 'xxxx',
        access_code => 'xxxx',
