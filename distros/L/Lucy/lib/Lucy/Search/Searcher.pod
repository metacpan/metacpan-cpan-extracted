Abstract base class for objects which search.  Core subclasses include
L<IndexSearcher|Lucy::Search::IndexSearcher> and
L<PolySearcher|Lucy::Search::PolySearcher>.

=head1 CONSTRUCTORS

=head2 new

    package MySearcher;
    use base qw( Lucy::Search::Searcher );

=head1 ABSTRACT METHODS

=head2 doc_max

    my $int = $searcher->doc_max();

Return the maximum number of docs in the collection represented by the
Searcher, which is also the highest possible internal doc id.
Documents which have been marked as deleted but not yet purged are
included in this count.

=head2 doc_freq

    my $int = $searcher->doc_freq(
        field => $field,  # required
        term  => $term,   # required
    );

Return the number of documents which contain the term in the given
field.

=over

=item *

B<field> - Field name.

=item *

B<term> - The term to look up.

=back

=head2 collect

    $searcher->collect(
        query     => $query,      # required
        collector => $collector,  # required
    );

Iterate over hits, feeding them into a
L<Collector|Lucy::Search::Collector>.

=over

=item *

B<query> - A Query.

=item *

B<collector> - A Collector.

=back

=head2 fetch_doc

    my $hit_doc = $searcher->fetch_doc($doc_id);

Retrieve a document.  Throws an error if the doc id is out of range.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 glean_query

    my $query = $searcher->glean_query($query);
    my $query = $searcher->glean_query();  # default: undef

If the supplied object is a Query, return it; if it’s a query string,
create a QueryParser and parse it to produce a query against all
indexed fields.

=head2 hits

    my $hits = $searcher->hits(
        query      => $query,       # required
        offset     => $offset,      # default: 0
        num_wanted => $num_wanted,  # default: 10
        sort_spec  => $sort_spec,   # default: undef
    );

Return a Hits object containing the top results.

=over

=item *

B<query> - Either a Query object or a query string.

=item *

B<offset> - The number of most-relevant hits to discard, typically
used when “paging” through hits N at a time.  Setting
C<offset> to 20 and C<num_wanted> to 10 retrieves
hits 21-30, assuming that 30 hits can be found.

=item *

B<num_wanted> - The number of hits you would like to see after
C<offset> is taken into account.

=item *

B<sort_spec> - A L<SortSpec|Lucy::Search::SortSpec>, which will affect
how results are ranked and returned.

=back

=head2 get_schema

    my $schema = $searcher->get_schema();

Accessor for the object’s C<schema> member.

=head1 INHERITANCE

Lucy::Search::Searcher isa Clownfish::Obj.
