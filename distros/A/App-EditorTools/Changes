    Let users choose their own leader key, simplify menu
    Since not all vim users might like to use the comma as their leader, we
    can simply use "<leader>" instead of "," when mapping the editor tools
    commands. (Thanks to mannih for the patch.)

    Updates pod and makes layout more github friendly.

    Fixes several problems with the emacs file that's installed. Thankes to
    lackita++ for the patch on github.
    * If the command failed, the entire contents of the file would be wiped
    * out, now it just puts a message in the minibuffer.
    * Extracted some methods to remove duplication and clarify intent.
    * Introduce temporary variable was using the start column value as the end
    * column value. 
    * Rename package was renaming all packages to the file path name.
