<h3>Dear Attendee,</h3>
<p>We would like to invite you to complete the following survey as best you 
can. Our aim is to allow us and future organisers to understand who attends 
these events, and also to see what we can do to improve the whole conference
experience for everyone. As a by-product we also hope to better focus our
attempts at getting the right kind of sponsorship for these events, so
that both you and the sponsors are getting the most out of the conferences.</p>
<p>Please note that your individual survey response will be stored anonymously.
Your conference survey code is only used to ensure multiple forms are not
submitted, and is referenced independently of your submitted survey response,
so we cannot correlate the two. We would be very grateful if you could complete 
this survey as soon as possible, as the survey will close at <b>midnight on 
[% survey_close %]</b>. </p>
<p>The initial results of this survey will be publish on the 
<a href="http://yapc-surveys.org">YAPC Conference Surveys</a> website, with 
more detailed feedback from the event being published later.</p>
<p>Many thanks for taking part.</p>
