NAME
    Module::Inspector - An integrated API for inspecting Perl distributions

DESCRIPTION
    An entire ecosystem of CPAN modules exist around the files and formats
    relating to the CPAN itself. Parsers and object models for various
    different types of files have been created over the years by various
    people for various projects.

    These modules have a variety of different styles, and work in various
    different ways.

    So when it comes to analysing the structure of a Perl module (either
    inside a repository, in a tarball, or in unpacked form) it is certainly
    quite possible to do.

    It's just that often it takes a high level of experience with the
    various modules in question, and the knowledge of how to combine the
    dozen of so modules in one cohesive program.

    Personally, I have always found this laborious.

    What I would prefer is a single API that is easy to use, implements the
    magic invisibly behind the scenes, and co-ordinates the use of the
    various modules for me as needed.

    Module::Inspector provides such an API, and provides a companion to the
    Class::Inspector API for accessing information on class after
    installation.

    It provides a wrapper around the various modules used to read and
    examine the different parts of a Perl module distribution tarball, and
    can inspect a module unrolled on disk, in a repository checkout, or just
    look directly inside a tarball.

METHODS
  new
      # Inspect a plain dist directory or cvs/svn checkout
      my $dir = Module::Inspector->new(
              dist_dir => $dirpath,
              );
  
      # Inspect a tarball
      my $file = Module::Inspector->new(
              dist_file => 'Foo-Bar-0.01.tar.gz',
              );

    The "new" constructor creates a new module inspector. It takes a named
    param of either "dist_file", which should be the file path of the dist
    tarball, or "dist_dir", which is the root of the distribution directory
    (if it is already unrolled).

    The distribution will be quickly pre-scanned to locate the various
    significant documents in the distribution (although only a few are
    initially supported).

    Returns a new "Module::Inspector" object, or dies on exception.

  version_control
      my $vcs_type = $self->version_control;

    For reasons that will hopefully be more apparant later,
    Module::Inspector detects any version control system in use within the
    "dist_dir" for the module.

    Currently, support is limited to detection of CVS and Subversion.

    Returns a the name of the version control system detected in use as a
    string (currently 'cvs' or 'svn'). If no version control is able to be
    detected returns the null string ''.

  documents
    The "documents" method returns a list of the names of all the documents
    detected by the "Module::Inspector".

    In scalar context, returns the number of identifyable documens found in
    the distribution.

  document_type
      # Returns 'PPI::Document::File'
      my $ppi_class = $inspector->document_type('lib/Foo.pm');

    In Module::Inspector, all documents are represented as objects.

    Thus, for each different type of document, there is going to be a
    different class that implements the document objects for that type.

    The "document_type" method returns the type for a provided document as a
    class name.

    Please note that at this time these document types are not necesarily
    stable, and over the first several releases I may need to change the
    class I'm using to represent a particular document type.

  document
      my $perl = $inspector->document('lib/Foo.pm');

    The "document" method returns the document object for a named file,
    loading and caching it on the fly if needed.

    The type of object will vary depending on the document.

    For example, a Perl file will be returned as a PPI::Document, a MANIFEST
    file as a Module::Manifest, and so on.

    Returns an object, or dies on error.

  dist_name
      # Returns Config-Tiny
      my $name = $inspector->dist_name;

    The "dist_name" method returns the name of the distribution, as
    determined from the META.yml file.

    Returns the name as a string, or dies on error.

  dist_version
    The "dist_version" method returns the version of the distribution, as
    determined from the META.yml file in the distribution.

    Returns a version object, or dies on error.

  dist_requires
      my $depends = $inspector->dist_requires;

    The "dist_requires" method checks for any run-time dependencies of the
    distribution and returns them as a Module::Math::Depends object.

    See the docs for Module::Math::Depends for more information on its
    structure and API.

    If the distribution has no run-time dependencies, the object will still
    be returned, but will be empty.

    Returns a single Module::Math::Depends object, or dies on error.

  dist_build_requires
    The "dist_build_requires" method returns the build-time-only
    dependencies of the distribution.

    If there are no build-time dependencies, the object will still be
    returned, but will be empty.

    Returns a Module::Math::Depends object, or dies on exception.

  dist_depends
    The "dist_depends" method returns as for the two methods above
    ("dist_requires" and "dist_build_requires") except that this method
    returns a merged dependency object, representing BOTH the install-time
    and run-time dependencies for the distribution.

    If there are no build-time or run-time dependencies, the object will be
    returned, but will be empty.

    Returns a Module::Math::Depends object, or dies on error.

TO DO
    - Implement most of the functionality

SUPPORT
    This module is stored in an Open Repository at the following address.

    <http://svn.ali.as/cpan/trunk/Module-Inspector>

    Write access to the repository is made available automatically to any
    published CPAN author, and to most other volunteers on request.

    If you are able to submit your bug report in the form of new (failing)
    unit tests, or can apply your fix directly instead of submitting a
    patch, you are strongly encouraged to do so as the author currently
    maintains over 100 modules and it can take some time to deal with
    non-Critcal bug reports or patches.

    This will guarentee that your issue will be addressed in the next
    release of the module.

    If you cannot provide a direct test or fix, or don't have time to do so,
    then regular bug reports are still accepted and appreciated via the CPAN
    bug tracker.

    <http://rt.cpan.org/NoAuth/ReportBug.html?Queue=Module-Inspector>

    For other issues, for commercial enhancement or support, or to have your
    write access enabled for the repository, contact the author at the email
    address above.
