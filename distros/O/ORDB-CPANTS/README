NAME
    ORDB::CPANTS - An ORM for the published CPANTS SQLite database

SYNOPSIS
      TO BE COMPLETED

DESCRIPTION
    TO BE COMPLETED

METHODS
  dsn
      my $string = Foo::Bar->dsn;

    The "dsn" accessor returns the dbi connection string used to connect to
    the SQLite database as a string.

  dbh
      my $handle = Foo::Bar->dbh;

    To reliably prevent potential SQLite deadlocks resulting from multiple
    connections in a single process, each ORLite package will only ever
    maintain a single connection to the database.

    During a transaction, this will be the same (cached) database handle.

    Although in most situations you should not need a direct DBI connection
    handle, the "dbh" method provides a method for getting a direct
    connection in a way that is compatible with ORLite's connection
    management.

    Please note that these connections should be short-lived, you should
    never hold onto a connection beyond the immediate scope.

    The transaction system in ORLite is specifically designed so that code
    using the database should never have to know whether or not it is in a
    transation.

    Because of this, you should never call the ->disconnect method on the
    database handles yourself, as the handle may be that of a currently
    running transaction.

    Further, you should do your own transaction management on a handle
    provided by the <dbh> method.

    In cases where there are extreme needs, and you absolutely have to
    violate these connection handling rules, you should create your own
    completely manual DBI->connect call to the database, using the connect
    string provided by the "dsn" method.

    The "dbh" method returns a DBI::db object, or throws an exception on
    error.

  selectall_arrayref
    The "selectall_arrayref" method is a direct wrapper around the
    equivalent DBI method, but applied to the appropriate locally-provided
    connection or transaction.

    It takes the same parameters and has the same return values and error
    behaviour.

  selectall_hashref
    The "selectall_hashref" method is a direct wrapper around the equivalent
    DBI method, but applied to the appropriate locally-provided connection
    or transaction.

    It takes the same parameters and has the same return values and error
    behaviour.

  selectcol_arrayref
    The "selectcol_arrayref" method is a direct wrapper around the
    equivalent DBI method, but applied to the appropriate locally-provided
    connection or transaction.

    It takes the same parameters and has the same return values and error
    behaviour.

  selectrow_array
    The "selectrow_array" method is a direct wrapper around the equivalent
    DBI method, but applied to the appropriate locally-provided connection
    or transaction.

    It takes the same parameters and has the same return values and error
    behaviour.

  selectrow_arrayref
    The "selectrow_arrayref" method is a direct wrapper around the
    equivalent DBI method, but applied to the appropriate locally-provided
    connection or transaction.

    It takes the same parameters and has the same return values and error
    behaviour.

  selectrow_hashref
    The "selectrow_hashref" method is a direct wrapper around the equivalent
    DBI method, but applied to the appropriate locally-provided connection
    or transaction.

    It takes the same parameters and has the same return values and error
    behaviour.

  prepare
    The "prepare" method is a direct wrapper around the equivalent DBI
    method, but applied to the appropriate locally-provided connection or
    transaction

    It takes the same parameters and has the same return values and error
    behaviour.

    In general though, you should try to avoid the use of your own prepared
    statements if possible, although this is only a recommendation and by no
    means prohibited.

  pragma
      # Get the user_version for the schema
      my $version = Foo::Bar->pragma('user_version');

    The "pragma" method provides a convenient method for fetching a pragma
    for a datase. See the SQLite documentation for more details.

SUPPORT
    ORDB::CPANTS is based on ORLite 1.18.
