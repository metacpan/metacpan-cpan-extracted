Bio-Taxonomy-GlobalNames

Bio::Taxonomy::GlobalNames provides Perl objects and functions that 
interface with the Global Names Resolver web service. Using a REST client, 
input is sent to the service, whereas results are internally converted 
from JSON format to nested objects and returned to the user.

This module can be used for automated standardisation of species names, 
according to a variety of sources that can be manually selected, if needed. 
See also the example script, provided with this module.
