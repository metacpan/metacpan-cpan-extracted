NAME
    Net::FCP - http://freenet.sf.net client protocol

SYNOPSIS
     use Net::FCP;

     my $fcp = new Net::FCP;

     my $ni = $fcp->txn_node_info->result;
     my $ni = $fcp->node_info;

DESCRIPTION
    This module implements the first version of the freenet client protocol,
    for use with freenet versions 0.5. For freenet protocol version 2.0
    support (as used by freenet 0.7), see the AnyEvent::FCP module.

    See <http://freenet.sourceforge.net/index.php?page=fcp> for a
    description of what the messages do.

    The module uses AnyEvent to find a suitable Event module.

  IMPORT TAGS
    Nothing much can be "imported" from this module right now.

  FREENET BASICS
    Ok, this section will not explain any freenet basics to you, just some
    problems I found that you might want to avoid:

    freenet URIs are _NOT_ URIs
        Whenever a "uri" is required by the protocol, freenet expects a kind
        of URI prefixed with the "freenet:" scheme, e.g. "freenet:CHK...".
        However, these are not URIs, as freeent fails to parse them
        correctly, that is, you must unescape an escaped characters ("%2c"
        => ",") yourself. Maybe in the future this library will do it for
        you, so watch out for this incompatible change.

    Numbers are in HEX
        Virtually every number in the FCP protocol is in hex. Be sure to use
        "hex()" on all such numbers, as the module (currently) does nothing
        to convert these for you.

  THE Net::FCP CLASS
    $fcp = new Net::FCP [host => $host][, port => $port][, progress => \&cb]
        Create a new virtual FCP connection to the given host and port
        (default 127.0.0.1:8481, or the environment variables "FREDHOST" and
        "FREDPORT").

        Connections are virtual because no persistent physical connection is
        established.

        You can install a progress callback that is being called with the
        Net::FCP object, a txn object, the type of the transaction and the
        attributes. Use it like this:

           sub progress_cb {
              my ($self, $txn, $type, $attr) = @_;

              warn "progress<$txn,$type," . (join ":", %$attr) . ">\n";
           }

    $txn = $fcp->txn (type => attr => val,...)
        The low-level interface to transactions. Don't use it unless you
        have "special needs". Instead, use predefiend transactions like
        this:

        The blocking case, no (visible) transactions involved:

           my $nodehello = $fcp->client_hello;

        A transaction used in a blocking fashion:

           my $txn = $fcp->txn_client_hello;
           ...
           my $nodehello = $txn->result;

        Or shorter:

           my $nodehello = $fcp->txn_client_hello->result;

        Setting callbacks:

           $fcp->txn_client_hello->cb(
              sub { my $nodehello => $_[0]->result }
           );

    $txn = $fcp->txn_client_hello
    $nodehello = $fcp->client_hello
        Executes a ClientHello request and returns it's results.

           {
             max_file_size => "5f5e100",
             node => "Fred,0.6,1.46,7050"
             protocol => "1.2",
           }

    $txn = $fcp->txn_client_info
    $nodeinfo = $fcp->client_info
        Executes a ClientInfo request and returns it's results.

           }

    $txn = $fcp->txn_generate_chk ($metadata, $data[, $cipher])
    $uri = $fcp->generate_chk ($metadata, $data[, $cipher])
        Calculates a CHK, given the metadata and data. $cipher is either
        "Rijndael" or "Twofish", with the latter being the default.

    $txn = $fcp->txn_generate_svk_pair
    ($public, $private, $crypto) = @{ $fcp->generate_svk_pair }
        Creates a new SVK pair. Returns an arrayref with the public key, the
        private key and a crypto key, which is just additional entropy.

           [
             "acLx4dux9fvvABH15Gk6~d3I-yw",
             "cPoDkDMXDGSMM32plaPZDhJDxSs",
             "BH7LXCov0w51-y9i~BoB3g",
           ]

        A private key (for inserting) can be constructed like this:

           SSK@<private_key>,<crypto_key>/<name>

        It can be used to insert data. The corresponding public key looks
        like this:

           SSK@<public_key>PAgM,<crypto_key>/<name>

        Watch out for the "PAgM"-part!

    $txn = $fcp->txn_invert_private_key ($private)
    $public = $fcp->invert_private_key ($private)
        Inverts a private key (returns the public key). $private can be
        either an insert URI (must start with "freenet:SSK@") or a raw
        private key (i.e. the private value you get back from
        "generate_svk_pair").

        Returns the public key.

    $txn = $fcp->txn_get_size ($uri)
    $length = $fcp->get_size ($uri)
        Finds and returns the size (rounded up to the nearest power of two)
        of the given document.

    $txn = $fcp->txn_client_get ($uri [, $htl = 15 [, $removelocal = 0]])
    ($metadata, $data) = @{ $fcp->client_get ($uri, $htl, $removelocal)
        Fetches a (small, as it should fit into memory) key content block
        from freenet. $meta is a "Net::FCP::Metadata" object or "undef").

        The $uri should begin with "freenet:", but the scheme is currently
        added, if missing.

          my ($meta, $data) = @{
             $fcp->client_get (
                "freenet:CHK@hdXaxkwZ9rA8-SidT0AN-bniQlgPAwI,XdCDmBuGsd-ulqbLnZ8v~w"
             )
          };

    $txn = $fcp->txn_client_put ($uri, $metadata, $data, $htl, $removelocal)
    my $uri = $fcp->client_put ($uri, $metadata, $data, $htl, $removelocal);
        Insert a new key. If the client is inserting a CHK, the URI may be
        abbreviated as just CHK@. In this case, the node will calculate the
        CHK. If the key is a private SSK key, the node will calculcate the
        public key and the resulting public URI.

        $meta can be a hash reference (same format as returned by
        "Net::FCP::parse_metadata") or a string.

        The result is an arrayref with the keys "uri", "public_key" and
        "private_key".

  THE Net::FCP::Txn CLASS
    All requests (or transactions) are executed in a asynchronous way. For
    each request, a "Net::FCP::Txn" object is created (worse: a tcp
    connection is created, too).

    For each request there is actually a different subclass (and it's
    possible to subclass these, although of course not documented).

    The most interesting method is "result".

    new arg => val,...
        Creates a new "Net::FCP::Txn" object. Not normally used.

    $txn = $txn->cb ($coderef)
        Sets a callback to be called when the request is finished. The
        coderef will be called with the txn as it's sole argument, so it has
        to call "result" itself.

        Returns the txn object, useful for chaining.

        Example:

           $fcp->txn_client_get ("freenet:CHK....")
              ->userdata ("ehrm")
              ->cb(sub {
                 my $data = shift->result;
              });

    $txn = $txn->userdata ([$userdata])
        Set user-specific data. This is useful in progress callbacks. The
        data can be accessed using "$txn->{userdata}".

        Returns the txn object, useful for chaining.

    $txn->cancel (%attr)
        Cancels the operation with a "cancel" exception and the given
        attributes (consider at least giving the attribute "reason").

        UNTESTED.

    $result = $txn->result
        Waits until a result is available and then returns it.

        This waiting is (depending on your event model) not very efficient,
        as it is done outside the "mainloop". The biggest problem, however,
        is that it's blocking one thread of execution. Try to use the
        callback mechanism, if possible, and call result from within the
        callback (or after is has been run), as then no waiting is
        necessary.

  The Net::FCP::Exception CLASS
    Any unexpected (non-standard) responses that make it impossible to
    return the advertised result will result in an exception being thrown
    when the "result" method is called.

    These exceptions are represented by objects of this class.

    $exc = new Net::FCP::Exception $type, \%attr
        Create a new exception object of the given type (a string like
        "route_not_found"), and a hashref containing additional attributes
        (usually the attributes of the message causing the exception).

    $exc->type([$type])
        With no arguments, returns the exception type. Otherwise a boolean
        indicating wether the exception is of the given type is returned.

    $exc->attr([$attr])
        With no arguments, returns the attributes. Otherwise the named
        attribute value is returned.
