  - silenced "alpha->numify() is lossy" warning

0.39 2016/01/10
  - no code changes

0.38 2016/01/09
  - no code changes
  - added diagnostic messages to find the reason of sporadic

0.37 2016/01/07
  - ported version_ok() implemented in PAUSE to disallow a VERSION
    that is too long to store correctly in the PAUSE database

0.36 2015/04/16
  - removed an unnecessary $DB::single line (oalders++)

0.35 2015/01/17

0.34 2015/01/04
  - fixed a case where our $VERSION is in a block. (ether++, mst++)

0.33 2014/12/13
  - reverted the change in 0.32 to store overloaded stuff in the object
    which seems to have caused segfaults under some environments

0.32 2014/12/12
  - improved version->declare handling (by numifying earlier for Safe
    not to do with a version object)
  - stored overloaded stuff in the object

0.31 2014/12/09
  - fixed cases where version->declare / qv() used in the VERSION line
    without using version explicitly

0.30 2014/12/05
  - restore overloaded stuff from version::vpp as well (if necessary)
    (haarg++)

0.29 2014/10/10
  - silenced a redefinition warning

0.28 2014/10/08
  - import qv into main package if UNSAFE

0.27 2014/10/08
  - added UNSAFE option for older perls plus recent versions of
    Safe/version

0.24 2014/09/17
  - improved fatpacked version::vpp support

0.23 2014/09/16
  - let Safe compartment share charstar:: stuff so that older perls
    forced to use version::vpp can correctly parse $VERSION declared by
    version->declare. (miyagawa++)

0.22 2014/09/02
  - tweak for backward compatibility

0.21 2014/09/02

  - bumped up the version requirement slightly (moznion++)

0.18 2014/04/28
  - make sure to erase stuff in Safe.pm and restore overloaded
    version.pm stuff so that version.pm works correctly after
    parsing versions via Parse::PMFile
  - cpanfile
