HTML-EditableTable 0.21

This module was developed to simplify the manipuation of complex tabular data in engineering and business-process web applications.  The developement was motivated by a rapid-prototype software development flow where the requirements gathering phase goes something like "I have this big complicated spreadsheet that I want to make a website out of - can you help?".  The EditableTable class is an 'abstract' base class and EditableTable::Horizontal and EditableTable::Vertical are the implementations for two commonly used table types.
