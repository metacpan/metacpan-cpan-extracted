Revision history for Perl extension HTML::Template::Pro::Extension.

0.11 Wed Jul 23 15:19:04 2014
	- Update documentation

0.10 (2009-10-27)
=================
- A change in H::T::Pro interface (probabily). I don't find anymore clear_param
  and there is a new method called clear_params.

0.09 (2006-08-19)
=================
- H::T::P::Extension::HEAD_BODY::header_css now return also <link...> tags with
  "rel" attribute equal to "stylesheet" and "type" equal to "text/css".

0.08 (2005-11-02)
=================
- Now, when calling filters, the object is passed to filter as second parameter.
- Removed a bug in the HEAD_BODY.pm module that cannot parse headers sometimes.

0.07 (2005-09-20)
=================
- In vanguard mode, key can be start with an underscore (_) too because, for
  example, some internal LOOP variable (__COUNTER__,...) start with it.

0.06 (2005-09-19)
=================
- In vanguard mode (%....) now is accepted only keys that start with alpha
  characters [A-Za-z]

0.05 (2005-09-14)
=================
- If you try to initialize H::T::P::Extention with some parameters that should
  be routed to H::T::Pro, it doesn't work because H::T::P::Extension 
	inizialize H::T::Pro with internal parameters. Now you can pass 
	initializing parameters (like functions as an example) to H::T::P::Extension
	that routed them to H::T::Pro.

0.04 (2005-08-21)
=================
- A little optimization in calling H::T::P->param method.

0.03 (2005-08-18)
=================
- Removed a bug.

0.02 (2005-08-17)
=================
- Minor changes

0.01 (2005-08-16)
=================
- First release derived from HTML::Template::Extension
