LSF::Base - Access Platform Computing's LSF (Load Sharing Facility) Base API

Most of the functions in the API have been implemented and tested, but
the formal test.pl is still rather skimpy, as you can see from the
test.pl. The Testlist file shows which calls have been tested as of
today.

If you are interested in contributing at this point, you can:

1: Write some more tests so I can get this whole thing tested.
2: Flesh out the interfaces to a few calls that I haven't implemented
   yet, ls_loadinfo() being the most notable.
3: If you have ideas for improving the "perlishness" of the interface
   chime right in.

Notes:

This has now been tested on both AIX and Solaris. It is currently in
production use at my site, without too many problems, so far.

Thanks to Jim Meyer of Platform Computing for his Makefile.PL.
