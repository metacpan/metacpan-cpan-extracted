NAME
    Module::Pluggable::Loader - Just load plugins, aware of development
    directories

VERSION
    version 1.100860

SYNOPSIS
        use Module::Pluggable::Loader 'My::Plugin::Namespace';

DESCRIPTION
    This module is a simple loader for plugins found by Module::Pluggable.
    The search paths can be specified when using the module.
    Module::Pluggable's "search_dirs" option will be made aware of
    development directories found by Devel::SearchINC, if any exist.

    The plugins will then be loaded, but not instantiated.

    One use for this module is when defining test classes - see Test::Class
    - as plugins. You don't want to instantiate those classes, just load
    them and let Test::Class handle the rest.

FUNCTIONS
  import
    Handles the calls to Module::Pluggable at compile-time, that is, when
    calling "use()" on this module.

INSTALLATION
