NAME
    Log::Any::Adapter::Journal - Adapter for Log::Any that outputs with a
    priority prefix that systemd's journal can parse

VERSION
    version 1.0

STATUS
SYNOPSIS
        use Log::Any::Adapter;
        Log::Any::Adapter->set( 'Journal', 
            # min_level => 'debug', # default is 'warning'
            # colors    => { }, # customize colors
            # use_color => 1, # force color even when not interactive
            # stderr    => 0, # print to STDOUT instead of the default STDERR
            # formatter => sub { "LOG: $_[1]" }, # default none
        );

DESCRIPTION
    When sending log messages to systemd's journal, the priority can be set
    by prefixing the message with the priority (as a number) in angled
    brackets. This adapter will format Log::Any messages to accomodate the
    systemd's log parser.

    By default, systemd will parse the output from commands run as systemd
    services/units for the priority prefix (both STDOUT and STDERR). Users
    can also pipe output through the "systemd-cat" command to enable parsing
    of priority for scripts.

    Journald doesn't support the trace (8) log level. If the min_level is
    set to 'trace', then logs will be sent to journald with the debug (7)
    log level. This behavior changed in version 1.0 of
    Log::Any::Adapter::Journal. Prior to version 1.0, trace logs were
    treated as if they were debug logs, so they were sent to with debug (7)
    log level even if min_level was 'debug'.

    This adapter is based on the Log::Any::Adapter::Screen, and accepts the
    same optional settings. We assume you want color output when running
    interactively and the priority prefix otherwise. More precisely, the
    priority prefix will be added when "! -t STDIN" or "!!use_color". See
    Log::Any::Adapter::Screen for more information on the various options.
