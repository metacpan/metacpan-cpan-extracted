NAME
    Devel::Assert - assertions for Perl >= 5.14

SYNOPSIS
        use Devel::Assert; # release mode, won't perform checks

        assert(3 < 2); 

        use Devel::Assert 'on';

        assert(3 < 2); # oops, check your math

USAGE
        use Devel::Assert; # import 'assert' function, but doesn't enable it
        use Devel::Assert 'on'; # import 'assert' function and enable it

        use Devel::Assert 'global'; # import 'assert' function and enable it in all later 'use Devel::Assert' imports
        use Devel::Assert::Global; # the same, can be used as perl -MDevel::Assert::Global your_program.pl

        use Devel::Assert 'off'; # import 'assert' function, but doesn't enable it, even when in 'global' mode

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides you with a C-like assert() function. And, like in
    C, it only is compiled in debug mode - it's completely removed together
    with it's arguments at compile time in release mode. That's useful to
    force functions' contracts during development without sacrificing
    production performance.

    Think of an assert() being a test, but right inside your code:

        sub get_url {
            my ($self, $url, $cb) = @_;

            assert length $url;
            assert(ref($cb) eq 'CODE');

            ...
        }

    Failed assertions are reported by confess with failed test code
    embedded:

        Assertion 'ref $cb eq 'CODE'' failed at ...

    This module doesn't use source filters or any other form of source text
    parsing, but instead relies on the generated optree analysis and
    manipulation.

CHANGES FROM 0.04
    This version significantly differs from 0.04 release. The main reason
    behind such radical change was to get rid of the Devel::Declare
    dependency and to pass all the parsing work to Perl itself (instead of
    creating own statement parser).

SEE ALSO
    assertions - uses code attributes

    Carp::Assert - requires annoying 'if DEBUG' suffix

    PerlX::Assert - based on Devel::Declare
