DBIx::ProcedureCall version 0.10
=============================

NOTE:
While the interface provided by DBIx::ProcedureCall is 
database-independent,
only Oracle and PostgreSQL are currently implemented.

When developing applications for a database that supports
stored procedures, it is a good 
idea to put all your database access code right into the
database..

This module provides a convenient way to call these stored
procedures from Perl by creating wrapper subroutines that
produce the necessary SQL statements, bind parameters and run
the query.

	use DBIx::ProcedureCall qw(sysdate);
	my $conn = DBI->connect(.....);  
	print sysdate($conn);
	
There is also a command line interface: After setting the
appropriate environment variable with the connection information,
you can do

	perl -MDBIx::ProcedureCall::CLI -e function sysdate


INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   # if you want to run  Oracle tests
   export ORACLE_USERID = 'username/passwd@dbname'
   # if you want to run PostgreSQL tests
   export PGUSER = 'username'
   make test
   make install
   
The ORACLE_USERID and PGUSER environment variables are
only needed to connect to the database
during "make test" and will not be stored anywhere.
The tests use the database read-only.

DEPENDENCIES

This module strictly speaking does not require, but is pretty useless without
these other modules:

  DBI
  DBD::Oracle or DBD::Pg
