	  big-endian, sizeof(int)==4, and sizeof(long)==8 platform
	  with the GNU Readline Library 7.0. [rt.cpan.org #118371]

1.34  2016-06-12
	- ppport.h: update from version 1.0007 to version 3.31.

1.32  2016-06-06
	- improve UTF-8 handling
	  - UTF-8 decoding is done at the interface between Perl and

            from the GNU Readline Library functions and variables.
	  - add enableUTF8() method
	  - UTF-8 support is enabled when STDIN is in UTF-8 by the -C
	    command-line switch, or PERL_UNICODE environment variable,
	    or IN file handle has utf8 IO layer, or -enableUTF8 method
	    is called.
	  - pop IO layer only when stdio layer is pushed on utf8 layer
            to support Perl 5.8.x

              characters
