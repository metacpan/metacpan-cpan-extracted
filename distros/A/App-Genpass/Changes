2.400   12.10.16

        * Cleanup Pod. (Brian Manning)
        * Create passwords in a more secure fashion (ie not simply rand()).
          (Arthur Axel fREW Schmidt)

2.34    04.08.14
        * GH #3: When provided some empty types, it would loop forever.

        * Reinstate configuration reading which was removed with the move
          to Moo.
        * RT #81287: Update docs to reflect Mouse no longer used.
          (Props to zaxon)

2.32    01.07.12
        * RT #77652: Depend directly on MooX::Types::MooseLike.
          (nice catch, Brad Bowman!)

        * number was accidentally a Bool instead of Int.
          (nice catch, Jonathan Swartz! *COUGH*USETHECHI*COUGH*)

        - Move from Mouse to Moo - MUCH FASTER!

        - Add minlength and maxlength (Neil Bowers).
        - Correct warning (Neil Bowers).

2.10    08.08.11
        - Removing the need for "special" boolean flag. Using 'noreadable'

        characters.

        - Clarify the distribution contains an application as well.
