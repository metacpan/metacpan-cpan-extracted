    This class provides a hash of European authors' PAUSE ID and name to the
    "Acme::CPANAuthors" module.

    If you're European CPAN author without further specified nationality,
    please send me your ID/name via email, and I may keep this module op to
    date.

BUGS

    necessarely the case, as Russia and Turkey lie in more than one
    continent.

TODO
    Add more countries if they become available.
