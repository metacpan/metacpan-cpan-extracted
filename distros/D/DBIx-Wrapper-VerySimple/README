DBIx::Wrapper::VerySimple - Simplify use of DBI
===============================================

DBIx::Wrapper::VerySimple is a simple module that provides a high-level
interface to the Perl DBI module. The provided methods are for fetching
a single record (returns a hashref), many records (returns
an arrayref of hashrefs), and for executing a non-select statement
(returns a result code).

The intention here is that your application will have much cleaner code,
so instead of writing:

    $sql = 'SELECT name,address FROM $table WHERE zipcode=?';
    $sth = $dbh->prepare($sql);
    $rv  = $sth->execute($zipcode);
    @found_rows;
    while ( my $hash_ref = $sth->fetchrow_hashref ) {
        push( @found_rows, $hash_ref );
    }

You would write:

    $sql = 'SELECT name,address FROM $table WHERE zipcode=?';
    $found_rows = $wrapper->fetch_all($sql,$zipcode); # An arrayref of hashrefs
