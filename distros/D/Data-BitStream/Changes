Revision history for Perl extension Data::BitStream.

0.08    16 Aug 2014
        - Updates to documentation.
        - Goldbach encoding almost 2x faster (sped up pair search).

0.07    1 Jan 2013
	- Change from Mouse to Moo.  Mouse has great performance, but the Perl
	  community is moving toward Moo/Moose and away from Any:Moose and
	  Mouse.  In most cases Moo will be similar performance assuming the
	  Class::XSAccessor module is installed.
	- Remove some Unicode characters that snuck into references.
	- Much faster primes for big Goldbach codes.  DBXS is still ~30x
	  faster overall, but almost all of that is the pair search.
        - Add BER and Varint codes.

0.06   28 May 2012
	- Make all tests numbered.
	- Documentation additions (Pod Coverage testing).
	- get_arice / put_arice modify the k parameter, just like XS code.
	- Update Additive / Goldbach to reflect DBXS and MPFS changes.

0.05   17 May 2012
	- Make a couple 64-bit tests work properly with the 'xs' module on
	  LLP64 systems.
	- Add put_raw, from_raw uses it.
	- String has custom to_raw and put_raw.
	- Inline C for decorrelator / predictor in image compression example.
	- Better behavior when doing bad reads.
	- Unify a lot of error strings.
	- Add generalized Fibonacci coding (order 2-16).
	- Add additive and Goldbach G1/G2 codes from Fenwick's 2002 IEEE paper.
	- Add comma codes (including ternary comma codes e.g. Fenwick 1996).
	- Add block-based taboo codes (Pigeon 2001).

0.04    9 Nov 2011
	- Fix late regression in one of the tests, unpack "W" -> "C".
	- Minor test and documentation changes.
	- Make most error strings consistent.

0.03   Mon Nov  7 06:00:00 2011
	- More work on unit tests.
	- Add BLVec class to use XS.  Inefficient but it works (and even with
	  the silly setpos/setlen after every call, it's much faster than PP).
	- Don't use Vec and BitVec implementations unless specifically asked.
	- Lossless image codec example.
	- Simple file support (read / write).
	- Text methods (code_get, code_put, add_code)
	- Performance.
	- Clarify POD compression example slightly.
	- More tests on 32-bit and big-endian machines.

0.02  Fri Sep 30 08:16:13 2011
	- Create dist with tool instead of by hand.  Uses version number.
	- WordVec was setting the Vec variables.

0.01  Mon Sep 26 10:12:53 2011
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.23 with options
		-XAn Data::BitStream

	- 24 Sep 2011, add Boldi-Vigna Zeta, Levenstein Codes, and Baer codes
	- 19 Sep 2011, make Golomb take a sub, better default impls
	- 14 Sep 2011, add skip(), optimizations
	- 13 Sep 2011, more tests, harden the reader/writer distinction
	- 12 Sep 2011, add Delta and Omega
	- 11 Sep 2011, add ExpGolomb, and fix readahead
	- 9 Sep 2011, split into Base/impls/codes, first unit tests,
		add Fibonacci, Golomb, and Rice encoding.
	- 8 Sep 2011, Vec and BitVec code, with Gamma and GG3
	- 24 Aug 2011, first Perl version, Unary
