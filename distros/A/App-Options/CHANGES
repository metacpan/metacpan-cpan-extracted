# CHANGE LOG
#############################################################################

VERSION 1.12
 x Added a copyright statement at the request of a Debian administrator.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=62017

VERSION 1.11
 x Added prefixadmin to the MANIFEST

VERSION 1.1
 x Supports the "secure" option attribute. (Also, all options which end in "pass" or "password"
   are assumed to be secure.) The value is a security level: 1=[don't print the value in a help screen].
   2=[ensure that the value can never be supplied on a command line or from the environment but
      only from a file that only the user running the program has read/write access to]

VERSION 1.07
 x Automagically add $PREFIX/lib/perl5 to @INC (only if it exists), else $PREFIX/lib/perl
   Also check $PREFIX/share/perl and add it to @INC if it exists.
   Surprisingly, $PREFIX/share/perl and $PREFIX/lib/perl seem to be the directories created
   and used under Ubuntu 8.04's perl.
 x Allow dashes ("-") as a variable name (i.e. foo-bar = 1).
   In doing this, I actually allow that any characters other than spaces/tabs/= can make up the variable name
 x Trim leading and trailing tabs (as well as spaces) from the line

VERSION 1.06
 x Remove trailing \r from option files (for Windows-edited .conf files)

VERSION 1.05
 x Substitutions of ${prefix} in option files now works even if only defined by assumption
   This is particularly valuable for portability between environments of CGI scripts and cron scripts.

VERSION 1.04
 x Fixed RT Bug #33597: Problem of ignoring drive letter on Win32 filesystem.

VERSION 1.03
 x better use of /\s*/ instead of / */ so that tabs don't catch you off-guard
 x enable application use of App::Options objects to read additional data structures
   * $option_processor = App::Options->new(@args);
   * $option_processor->read_option_files(\%values, [$file]);
 x allow for subclassing (App::Options::YAML, etc.)
   * made App::Options object-oriented to allow for subclassing
   * split read_option_files() method out of the read_options() method (for subclassing)
 x save the import arguments for later print_usage or later reparsing (as $self->{init_args})

VERSION 1.02
 x ENV{FOO} = x in app.conf sets environment variable "FOO" (i.e. LD_LIBRARY_PATH)
 x added perl_restart option to re-exec() the program so that it picks up a new LD_LIBRARY_PATH
 x save original @ARGV to @App::Options::ARGV (used for perl_restart/re-exec())
 x line continuation characters strip off newlines and leading spaces

VERSION 1.01
 x removed dependency in Makefile.PL on Config.pm (which was causing a false error on "make test")

VERSION 1.00
 x clean up for v1.00. no dependency on Module::Build (which has been giving problems)
 x add default values for MANPATH, LD_LIBRARY_PATH to bin/prefix
 x added t/file.txt so the test process doesn't spew warnings

VERSION 0.99
 x fixed a condition that didn't work on Windows when executing in current dir
 x fix double slash /usr/rubicon/test/bin//app.conf
 x improved --debug_options, --debug_options=[1-7] output

VERSION 0.98
 x disabled some tests that cause failure on MSWin32

VERSION 0.97
 x enable "here documents", var = <<EOF
 x enable file/cmd variables, var = < filename (or "cmd|")
 x allow line continuation chars, i.e. var = hello \\nworld

VERSION 0.96
 x cleaned up some of the --debug_options output
 x tests run clean on Win32
 x used File::Spec to make file/directory manipulation platform-independent (i.e. Win32)
   NOTE: I used a mix of platform-independent File::Spec functions and explicit
   conversion from "\" paths to POSIX-compliant "/" paths.  This is because the
   purist form of leaving "\" paths for Win32 was causing weirdness.  When
   I would interpolated the string or use it in a regular expression, the
   backslashes were interacting badly.  The only reason I'm not going to 1.0
   with this is that I want to see it pass Win32 tests on the CPAN testers
   farm before giving it that number.

VERSION 0.95
 x made a change (hack) to Build.PL to get it to work with the CPAN shell

VERSION 0.94
 x use Module::Build instead of ExtUtils::MakeMaker
 x add a META.yaml file to the distribution (from "Build distmeta")
 x add --version support (print out versions of all modules)
 x make prefix authoritative before defaults so that we can use ${prefix} in substitutions
 x set defaults in order of "options" to ensure the correct order for variable substitution

VERSION 0.93
 x prefix can now be set in $prog_dir/app.conf to find $prefix/etc/app/app.conf
 x single-line sections in option files are no longer independent of the
   section they are in.  Both the section-condition and the line-condition
   must now be satisfied for a value to be set.

VERSION 0.92
 x cleaned up some warnings which appeared under -w (concatenation of undef)
 x add system-supplied hostname and host options
 x variable substitution works with environment vars (url = http://$ENV{HOST})
 x auto-import of environment vars named "APP_*" even if not otherwise defined
 x usage: undefined values appear as "[undef]" rather than "[]"
 x usage: options appear as "--var=<value>" rather than "--var=<var>"
 x usage: "args_description" describes what's left on cmd line after options removed
 x usage: "value_description" describes option value (instead of "<value>")
 x added an examples directory
 x added a benchmark directory
 x default is $Config{prefix} instead of /usr/local
 x improve debug_options (env vars, etc.) (implemented 6 levels of debug_options)

VERSION 0.91
 x show_all is off by default whenever "option" or "options" used
 x remove app_path_info

VERSION 0.90
 x new "use App::Options (...);" syntax (rather than ->init(...) syntax)

VERSION 0.64
 x added $VERSION to App::Options (use VERSION_FROM in Makefile.PL)
 x fixed bug where "show_all" wasn't showing all on --help
 x touched up titles on pod documentation
 x implement import() method to use module outside the BEGIN block (i.e. use App::Options (@args))
 x update documentation with new syntax using import() method
 x improve show_all logic: show_all = 1 by default always unless overridden

VERSION 0.63
 x improve documentation (api reference, logic flow, usage tutorial)
 x "integer" type now matches integers with underscores (i.e. 1_000_000)
 x "float" type now matches numbers with underscores (i.e. 1_000.000_001)
 x added /etc/app/app.conf to the end of the option file search path
 x default "prefix" is now "/usr/local" instead of "."
 x {env} attribute of "" means don't search any env variable

VERSION 0.62
 x [prog] matches "prog" only. [/prog/] matches by regular expression.
   In version 0.61, the section [list] would match ($app =~ /list/).
   In version 0.62, the section [list] only matches ($app eq "list"),
   while [/list/] matches ($app =~ /list/).
 x type="/regexp/" matches regexp. unknown types ignored.
   In version 0.61, an option type which was not one of the known
   option types (integer, float, date, datetime, etc.), was considered
   automatically as a regular expression.
   In version 0.62, only types which take the form "/regexp/" are
   actually regular expressions.  All other unknown "types" are ignored.
   This sets the groundwork for better forward-compatibility when new
   types are introduced, they will not break older versions of the code.
   It also just seems clearer.
 x "show_all" option - shows all defined options, not just in [ options ]
   In version 0.61, the --help option would show all variables defined
   in the code, on the command line, or in any of the files (i.e.show_all=1).
   However, if the "options" argument is used in the init() method in the
   code, only those enumerated options would be shown (i.e. show_all=0).
   In version 0.62, the same behavior applies unless the "show_all"
   parameter is given explicitly.
 x quoting, var = " hello world "
   In version 0.61, variable values in the option file had leading and
   trailing spaces removed.  This meant that a value of a single space
   was not possible.
   In version 0.62, the same behavior applies.  However, if the 
   remaining text starts with " and ends with ", those quote marks are
   removed.  i.e. var = " " will result in the value of a single space,
   and message = "Hello world. " will have a trailing space.
 x check list of configurable environment vars ("env") instead of
   "APP_${uc_var}"
   In version 0.61, variable values could be supplied by specifying the
   variable prefixed with "APP_".  (i.e. "path" could be specified
   with "APP_PATH")
   In version 0.62, a list of environment variable names may be given
   and the first with a supplied value is used for the value.
   (i.e. options => { path => { env => "PATH" } } will cause the
   "path" variable to be set from the "PATH" environment variable.)

VERSION 0.61
 x Initial release
