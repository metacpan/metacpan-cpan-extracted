NAME
    rmcd - Remotely control a daemonized Mplayer process

SYNOPSIS
      rmcd [OPTION]... [FILE/URI]

DESCRIPTION
    rmcd is a mplayer daemon/client - it daemonizes itself, playing
    music/movies/radio stations and waiting for input through the named
    pipe.

    You can send commands, load and play new content whenever you like.

    You can run rmcd on one computer and remotely control it on another,
    fully transparent. It only cares for the presence of the named pipe.

    You can also setup mplayer to stream the content to you, creating a
    solution similar to MPD and their builti-in httpd streaming (except MPD
    does not support video streaming).

    rmcd features a built-in, user configurable, web radio management
    system, functionality for copying the current track to your portable mp3
    player or wherever you prefer, favorizing of tracks and loading of the
    same, now playing information for both local files and streams, along
    with other nifty stuff.
