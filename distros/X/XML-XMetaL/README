XML::XMetaL version 0.52
========================

*  XML::XMetaL::Utilities::Iterator fix again. This time it should work!

XML::XMetaL version 0.51
========================

* Bug fixes in the XML::XMetaL::Utilities::Iterator class

  The iterator could sometimes break off before all nodes were
  traversed.
  
* Added mock DOM classes to emulate XMetaL DOM trees. Useful for debugging
  the iterator.


XML/XMetaL version 0.51
=======================

XML::XMetaL is a framework for object oriented XMetaL development using Perl.
The framework makes it easy to write Perl classes that customize XMetaL.
The advantages of using the framework are:

* Object oriented development.

  Object oriented XMetaL application development, with nearly all code
  moved from XMetaL .mcr and .ctm files to Perl modules.

  In addition to the advantages of object oriented development, this
  makes it possible to use any editor for XMetaL development, not just
  Visual Studio (XMetaL 4+), or the built in editor (XMetaL 1.0 - 3.1).

* Better control over shared functions and code reuse.

  There is no longer any need to use global customization files, such as
  xmetal.mcr to share functionality over several customization packages.
  Instead, common functionality is factored out into Perl modules and
  reused only by those customizations that need them.

  This reduces the risk of conflicts between different customizations
  installed on the same XMetaL client.

* Automated unit and function testing.

  Using the framework it is possible to write automated unit and function
  tests for XMetaL applications using Test::More and other test frameworks.

* Utility functions.

  Useful utility functions, including a word counter, id generator,
  common XMetaL constants, node iterator, and more.


The object oriented development features, and the support for automated
unit and function testing makes the XML::XMetaL framework especially
useful when using Extreme Programming and other test driven development
methodologies.

This version is still in alpha state. Future versions may have changes
that are not fully backwards compatible.
