0.12 Sat 24 Mar 2007 00:00:00 +0100 (Ran Eilam <ran.eilam@gmail.com>)
	- You can now attach advice to subs in main:: package, see Advice tests
	- Made everything easier to install by including dependencies required for
	  testing
	- Added __always_fire option to Listenable
	- Listenable: You can now let listeners receive any parameters, not just
	  the event, see the test object_listener
	- Modified our hack on Hook::LexWrap so it does not ignore prototypes, see
	  Advice tests
	- Removed old warning from Makefile.PL

0.11 Tue 03 Aug 2004 00:00:00 +0100 (Ran Eilam <ran.eilam@gmail.com>)
	- Fixed problem in upgrading from 0.08, CPAN.pm was getting confused on
	  Advice and Modular, because they had no version numbers, and undef is
	  smaller than 0.08. (merlyn)
	- Lowered dependency on Test::Class to 0.03

0.10 Fri 30 Jul 2004 00:00:00 +0100 (Ran Eilam <ran.eilam@gmail.com>)
	- No longer a developer release
	- Added Listenable reusable aspect
	- Added subject_params() support for TestClass library aspect

0.09_03 Tue 06 Jul 2004 00:00:00 +0100 (Ran Eilam <ran.eilam@gmail.com>)
	- Added Carp::Heavy to list of untouchables in Weaver.pm, to avoid Carp
	  dumping core
	- Test::Class aspect allows for customizing IUT through init_subject_state

0.09_02 Sat 06 Mar 2004 00:00:00 +0100 (Ran Eilam <ran.eilam@gmail.com>)
	- AdviceContext now has the original code, so you can do AspectJ-style
	  around advice. You can call the original code from before or after
	  advice. Added AdviceContext::run_original.
	- Memoize can memoize in any context, not just scalar, again
	- Added Test::Class helper aspect
	- Started using Devel::Symdump

0.09_01 Sat 06 Mar 2004 00:00:00 +0100 (Ran Eilam <ran.eilam@gmail.com>)
	- Released for review by participants in YAPC::Israel 2004
	- New syntax is incompatible with old
	- New maintainer, Ran Eilam
	- Control flow pointcut: cflow(), done according to Marcel's design
	- Advice context trapping for control flow pointcuts
	- Use Test::Class for unit tests
	- Wormhole reusable aspect
	- Added prototypes so you can dispense with parentheses
	- Removed return/around pointcuts, added after advice
	- Removed attribute interface
	- Added a mutated version of Hook::LexWrap with support for
	  appending/removing arguments
	- Moved reusable aspects to Aspect::Library
	- regression: Aspect exported subs generate join points again

0.07 Wed 31 Jul 2002 22:42:27 +0200 (Marcel Gruenauer <marcel@cpan.org>)
	- The distribution has been adapted for use with perl5.8.0.
	  C<Hook::LexWrap> is now a core module, but there was a problem with
	  context (wantarray) handling with Aspect::Memoize. Sorry about the perl
	  5.6.x users, but this is bleeding-edge stuff, so you're expected to use
	  the very latest gear. Anyway, you can still get an earlier version (up
	  to 0.07) from CPAN, which will work with perl 5.6.x.
	- Aspect::Memoize is now intended for subroutines returning scalars only.
	  That is, if the sub is called in list context, it will still only
	  memoize, and return, a memoized scalar. Void context obviously doesn't
	  matter when it comes to memoization; subroutines returning lists are
	  something I have to think about.
	- Tests now use Test::More

0.07 Fri 15 Mar 2002 09:04:51 +0100 (Marcel Gruenauer <marcel@cpan.org>)
	- symbols exported from Aspect.pm now don't generate join points. So I
	  added Aspect::import() and modified Aspect::JoinPoint::enum() to check
	  for %Aspect::exp_syms.

0.06 Fri 26 Oct 2001 16:42:51 +0200 (Marcel Gruenauer <marcel@cpan.org>)
	- added around() function to Aspect.pm
	- added Aspect::Profiled
	- added Aspect::Attribute interface to creating advice
	- made Aspect::Advice's enable() and disable() return $self
	- added cookbook example program callflow_attr.pl
	- added cookbook recipes for bounds checking and change tracking, plus
	  sample programs

0.05 Thu 11 Oct 2001 09:44:50 +0200 (Marcel Gruenauer <marcel@cpan.org>)
	- removed dependency on Data::Denter

0.04 Mon 01 Oct 2001 18:33:00 +0200 (Marcel Gruenauer <marcel@cpan.org>)
	- removed the patched Hook::LexWrap now that 0.20 is out which fixes all
	  the problems of 0.10
	- added documentation (a recurring theme, never finishes)

0.03 Sun 30 Sep 2001 19:43:56 +0200 (Marcel Gruenauer <marcel@cpan.org>)
	- added documentation
	- Included a patched Hook::LexWrap that fixes a bug with wantarray
	  preservation in subroutine wrappers. Will be removed if and when Damian
	  approves of the patch or otherwise fixes the bug.

0.02 Fri 28 Sep 2001 12:59:06 +0200 (Marcel Gruenauer <marcel@cpan.org>)
	- added documentation
	- added '$::thisjp' global variable
	- added modular memoization aspect: Aspect::Memoize
	- added modular tracing aspect: Aspect::Trace
