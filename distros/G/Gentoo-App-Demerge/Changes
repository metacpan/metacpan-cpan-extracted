0.041
 - Tell user what we are doing when analyzing the current state

0.040
 - Speedups/Caching (in memory)
 - New storage format (uses less disk space; melts down ~13MB to 60kb per state)

 - Overall performance: up to 5 times faster than 0.035
 - Do not call GetTerminalSize() from Term::ReadKey when --postsync is called.
  (Problems occured while testing on ppc/efika. Reported by Wernfried Haas <amne@gentoo.org>)

 - Made NOCOLOR work with PortageXS-0.02.05

0.032
 - Fixed typo in help.
 - Work around for portage bug that made useflags appear multiple times in USE/IUSE.
 - Prettified output. Hope you all like it.
 - Added new option: -C, --nocolor: Turn off colors

0.031
 - Fixed error that some packages weren't emerged in a demerge --restore process (broken in 0.030).
 - New option --dir which can be used to change the datadir demerge uses. Furthermore this can also be
  done using the new .demergerc. See `man demerge` for further information.
