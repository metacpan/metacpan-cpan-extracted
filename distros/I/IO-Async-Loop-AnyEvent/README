NAME
    "IO::Async::Loop::AnyEvent" - use "IO::Async" with "AnyEvent"

SYNOPSIS
     use IO::Async::Loop::AnyEvent;

     my $loop = IO::Async::Loop::AnyEvent->new();

     $loop->add( ... );

     $loop->add( IO::Async::Signal->new(
           name => 'HUP',
           on_receipt => sub { ... },
     ) );

     $loop->loop_forever();

DESCRIPTION
    This subclass of IO::Async::Loop uses AnyEvent to perform its work.

CONSTRUCTOR
  $loop = IO::Async::Loop::AnyEvent->new
    This function returns a new instance of a "IO::Async::Loop::AnyEvent"
    object.

BUGS
    *   "watch_idle" and "unwatch_idle" don't work properly against
        "AnyEvent::Impl::IOAsync". At least, the unit tests fail, and some
        scheduled CODErefs never get executed, and sit in the internal queue
        of the inner-nested "IO::Async::Loop" that "AnyEvent::Impl::IOAsync"
        itself constructed. An easy workaround here is simply to pick
        another AnyEvent model, by using the "PERL_ANYEVENT_MODEL"
        environment variable.

        That all said, I am honestly surprised this is the only thing that
        breaks, when "IO::Async" is nested upon "AnyEvent" itself running
        atop another "IO::Async".

    *   The implementation of the "loop_once" method requires the use of an
        undocumented "AnyEvent" method ("one_event" before version 6,
        "_poll" thereafter). This happens to work at the time of writing,
        but as it is undocumented it may be subject to change.

        The "loop_forever" method does not rely on this undocumented method,
        so should be safe from upstream changes. Furthremore, if "AnyEvent"
        rather than "IO::Async" remains ultimately in control of the
        runtime, by waiting on condvars, this should not be problematic.
