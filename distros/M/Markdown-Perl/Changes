Revision history for pmarkdown and the Markdown::Perl module.

1.03 - 2024-04-10

 - Disable hard line breaks using two spaces in our default syntax because they
   are invisible in the source file.
 - Support a YAML table at the start of a document to provide metadata.
 - Bugfixes:
   - Disable some part of the Makefile of the project that can’t be parsed under
     Solaris.

1.02 - 2024-04-06

 - Improvement to the support of the original markdown syntax. This is probably
   the best that we will do as this is now quite faithful and some of the
   remaining differences are bugs in the original implementation.
 - Bugfixes:
   - Do not make a list loose when it is followed by blank lines.
   - Tab stops after list markers are properly computed.

1.01 - 2024-04-05

 - Deactivate the support for setext headings in pmarkdown default syntax.
 - Remove a copy of the input Markdown when using the functional interface.
 - Bugfixes:
   - Correctly scope a mode set in a call to convert().
   - Make the OO interface usable with read-only scalar for the Markdown
     content.

1.00 - 2024-03-31

 - Initial release with full support for the CommonMark spec, the GitHub
   Flavored Markdown extentions, and partial support for original Markdown
   syntax.
