This module contains a script to create and find directories in a
filesystem interactively and a accompanying perl module that does the
job of creating and finding the directories. You may install the
module and script like any other perl module, i.e. either running

  $ perl Build.PL
  $ ./Build test
  $ sudo ./Build install

or

  $ perl Makefile.PL
  $ make test
  $ sudo make install

If you just want the script, you may take the script gen_single_file to
incorporate the library into the script and have all in one place.

  $ gen_single_file mkdir_heute > mkdir_heute_single

Place mkdir_heute_single anywhere in your $PATH.

mkdir_heute - create and find directories interactive
-----------------------------------------------------
This script scans a basedir (~/A) for directories named YYYY/MM/DD
where YYYY, MM and DD are numbers corresponding to a year, month, day
of month, prints them on STDERR and asks for your input on STDIN.

You may

  - choose a directory from the list with it’s number

  - choose the current directory with ’q’ or ’.’

  - advance to the next or last page with ’n’ or ’l’

  - return to the previous or first page with ’p’ or ’f’

  - constrain the shown directories with ’/’ and a pattern

  - constrain the creation date of the directories with ’d’ followed by
    ’=’, ’<’ or ’>’ and a date (eg. 2009, 2009-04 or 2009-04-24)

  - create a new directory with ’+’ and a description for it

End your input with <Return> or <Enter>.
The script returns the choosen directory on STDOUT and may be used in a
shell alias like this:

  alias cdheute='cd `mkdir_heute`'

or

  alias cdheute='cd $(mkdir_heute)'

so that you can say ’cdheute’ on the command line and your working
directory will be changed to the choosen directory.
