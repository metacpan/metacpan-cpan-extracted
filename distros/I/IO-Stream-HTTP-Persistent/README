                printf "%d requests was sent\n", 0+@{ $http->{out_sizes} };
                $http->{out_sizes} = [];
            }
            if ($e & HTTP_RECV) {
                while (my $size = shift @{ $http->{in_sizes} }) {
                    my $http_reply = substr $io->{in_buf}, 0, $size, q{};
                    ...
                }
            }
            ...
        }

DESCRIPTION

    This module is plugin for IO::Stream which allow you to process
    complete HTTP requests and responses read/written by this stream. It's
    useful only for persistent HTTP connections (HTTP/1.0 with Keep-Alive
    and HTTP/1.1).

    On usual HTTP/1.0 non-persistent connections it's ease to detect sent
    HTTP request using SENT event and received HTTP response using EOF
    event. But on persistent connections that's become much more
    complicated: to detect end of single received HTTP response (or
    boundaries between several received responses) you have to parse HTTP
    protocol, and when HTTP/1.1 Pipelining is used it's not easy to find
    out how many complete requests was already sent.

    This module will parse HTTP protocol for sent and received data, and
    will generate non-standard events HTTP_SENT and HTTP_RECV when one or
    more complete HTTP requests will be sent or HTTP responses received. It
    will provide you with list of sizes for each sent request and received
    response, which make it ease to find how many requests was sent or get
    separate responses from {in_buf}.

EXPORTS

    This modules doesn't export any functions/methods/variables, but it
    exports some constants. There two groups of constants: events and
    errors (which can be imported using tags ':Event' and ':Error'). By
    default all constants are exported.

    Events:

        HTTP_SENT HTTP_RECV

    Errors:

        HTTP_EREQINCOMPLETE HTTP_ERESINCOMPLETE

    Errors are similar to $! - they're dualvars, having both textual and
    numeric values.

INTERFACE

 new

        $plugin = IO::Stream::HTTP::Persistent->new();

    Create and return new IO::Stream plugin object.

PUBLIC FIELDS

    in_sizes =[]

    out_sizes =[]

      Size of each complete sent HTTP request or received HTTP response
      will be pushed into these fields.

      You can remove elements from these arrays if you need, but you should
      keep these fields in ARRAYREF format.

EVENTS

    HTTP_SENT

    HTTP_RECV

      These non-standard events will be generated when one or more complete
      HTTP requests will be sent or one or more HTTP responses will be
      received. Their sizes will be push()ed into fields {out_sizes} and
      {in_sizes} before generating events.

      Instead of using these events you can use standard IN and OUT events
      and check is new items was added to {out_sizes} and {in_sizes}.

ERRORS

    HTTP_EREQINCOMPLETE

      All HTTP headers of one request MUST be appended to {out_buf} using
      single $io->write(), otherwise you'll get HTTP_EREQINCOMPLETE. It's
      safe to add request body after that using any amount of $io->write().

      You can safely continue I/O after receiving HTTP_EREQINCOMPLETE, but
      after that error you'll not get HTTP_SENT event and {out_sizes} won't
      be updated anymore.

    HTTP_ERESINCOMPLETE

      Unexpected EOF happens while receiving HTTP response.

LIMITATIONS

      * This plugin usually should be first (top) plugin in IO::Stream
      object's plugin chain, because if upper plugins will somehow modify
      {in_buf} or {out_buf} then values in {in_sizes} and {out_sizes} may
      become wrong.

      * {out_buf} MUST NOT be modified in any way except by appending new
      data.

      * Partial HTTP response in {in_buf} MUST NOT be modified. It's safe
      to cut from start of {in_buf} complete HTTP responses.
