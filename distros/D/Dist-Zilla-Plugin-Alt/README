NAME

    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Alt - Create Alt distributions with Dist::Zilla

VERSION

    version 0.07

SYNOPSIS

    Your dist.ini:

     [GatherDir]
     [MakeMaker]
     [Alt]

DESCRIPTION

    This Dist::Zilla plugin can be added to an existing dist.ini file to
    turn your (or someone else's) distribution into an Alt distribution.
    What it does is:

    Modifies Makefile.PL or Build.PL

      Adds code to change the install location so that your dist won't be
      installed unless the environment variable PERL_ALT_INSTALL is set to
      OVERWRITE.

    Updates the no_index meta

      So that only .pm files in your lib directory that are in the Alt::
      namespace will be indexed.

    Sets the dist name property

      If the name isn't already set in your dist.ini by some other means,
      this plugin will set the name based on the Alt module. If you have
      more than one Alt module (which would be unusual) then it is an error
      unless you set the name by some other means.

CAVEATS

    This plugin should appear in your dist.ini toward the end, or at least
    after your [GatherDir] and [MakeMaker] plugins (or equivalent).
