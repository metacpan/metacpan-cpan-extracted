0.05    2016-03-29  Released-By: PERLANCAR

        - [Incompatible change] Tree::Object::Array now uses
          Class::Accessor::Array instead of Class::Build::Array::Glob (object
          storage layout changed).

        - Add Tree::Object::Array::Glob which uses Class::Accessor::Array::Glob
          which uses the same object storage layout like the old
          Tree::Object::Array.

	- [dist] Add missing dep to Class::Build::Array::Glob [RT#113409].


0.03    2016-03-26  Released-By: PERLANCAR

        - This distribution now includes more than one implementation of tree
          objects.

        - [Incompatible change] Rename module Tree::Object to
          Tree::Object::Hash. Parent and children are now stored in '_parent'
          and '_children' keys respectively instead of 'parent' and 'children',
          to denote that they are internal and to reduce chance of clash. To set
          children, an arrayref must now be passed to children() instead of
          list. This is because passing a list to set an arrayref attribute is
          incompatible with accessor generators.

        - The main module Tree::Object now becomes empty and contains just a
          link to all the available implementations.

        - Add Tree::Object::Array.
