	Fixed the 'make test' problem - it was a permissions thing
	where the cgi files had to be executable.  Go figure. ;)

	I also updated the POD documentation AUTHORS section to
	have folks bug me.

	Updated README file to let folks know I'm the new maintainer of
	this module.  Other than that, nothing else has been changed.

. Description:

	Fixed HISTORY section.

	Random cleanup in named argument docs, to add the "=>" where it
	should be.

	Removed DFEATURE call from stringify hooks in the Exception
	hierarchy.  With Carp::Datum turned on with argument listing,
	that would cause an infinite recursion.

	Added sub-section on creation routine in the CGI::MxScreen::Screen
	manpage.

	Minor README reformatting.

	Forgot to list all t/ in MANIFEST.

Sun Apr 22 19:31:07 MEST 2001   Raphael Manfredi <Raphael_Manfredi@pobox.com>

	Version 0.1.0.
	First public alpha release.
