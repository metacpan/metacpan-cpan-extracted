SYNOPSIS
      # in your Catalyst application:

  __PACKAGE__->config(
          simpleauth => { class => 'Users' },
      );
      
  # in your sign up code
      
  unless( $c->sign_up(
                {   username => $email,
                    password => $password,
                }
            ) ) {
            # sign up failed, user exists
      }
      my $user = $c->user;
      ...

      # in your sign in code
      
  my $user = $c->user; 
      if ($c->sign_in(
              {   username => $email,
                  password => $password,
              }
          )
          )
      {
          my $user = $c->user;
          ...
      } else {
          # sign in failed
      }

      # in your sign out code

      $c->sign_out;

DESCRIPTION
    This module is a replacement module for Catalyst::Authentication::*
    which does one thing and does it well. This module assumes that you have
    a model for the users you wish to authenticate - this will typically be
    a DBIx::Class module.

    You set the name of the model to authenticate in the configuration as
    above. 'sign_up' creates the instance for you. 'sign_in' signs a person
    in, 'sign_out' signs a person out. You can access the user object either
    as $c->user in the code or as the 'user' variable in the stash.

    This module saves SHA1 digests of the passwords instead of the password.

    The model will generally have a database structure along the lines of:

      CREATE TABLE `users` (
        `username` text NOT NULL,
        `password` char(40) NOT NULL,
        `first_name` text,
        `last_name` text
      );

    Note that the password will be 40 characters long.

    This module requires either Catalyst::Plugin::Session or
    Catalyst::Plugin::CookiedSession.
