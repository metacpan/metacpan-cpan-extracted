NAME

    Time::Moment::Role::TimeZone - Adjust Time::Moment with time zone
    objects

SYNOPSIS

      use Role::Tiny ();
      use DateTime::TimeZone;
    
      my $tz = DateTime::TimeZone->new(name => 'America/New_York');
      my $class = Role::Tiny->create_class_with_roles('Time::Moment', 'Time::Moment::Role::TimeZone');
      my $tm = $class->from_epoch(1000212360)->with_time_zone_offset_same_instant($tz);
    
      use Time::Moment;
      use Role::Tiny ();
      use DateTime::TimeZone::Olson 'olson_tz';
    
      my $tz = olson_tz('Europe/Oslo');
      my $tm = Time::Moment->new(year => 2012, month => 3, day => 4, hour => 13, minute => 7, second => 42);
      Role::Tiny->apply_roles_to_object($tm, 'Time::Moment::Role::TimeZone');
      $tm = $tm->with_time_zone_offset_same_local($tz);

DESCRIPTION

    This role provides convenience methods to return a new Time::Moment
    object adjusted according to a DateTime::TimeZone/ ::Tzfile-compatible
    time zone object, as in "TIME ZONES" in Time::Moment. See "CAVEATS"
    regarding usage with date math.

METHODS

 with_time_zone_offset_same_instant

      my $same_instant = $tm->with_time_zone_offset_same_instant($tz);

    Returns a Time::Moment of the same instant, but at an offset from UTC
    according to the given time zone object at that instant.

 with_time_zone_offset_same_local

      my $same_local = $tm->with_time_zone_offset_same_local($tz);

    Returns a Time::Moment of the same local time, with an offset from UTC
    according to the given time zone object at that local time.

CAVEATS

    Time::Moment does not store a time zone; these methods only set the
    offset and local time for the instantaneous moment represented by the
    object. After doing date math with the object, new times may need to be
    corrected, based on whether the date math was intended to be done
    relative to the absolute or local time.

      my $tm = $class->now->with_time_zone_offset_same_instant($tz); # now in $tz
      my $next_day = $tm->plus_days(1)->with_time_zone_offset_same_local($tz); # 1 day from now in $tz
      my $24h_later = $tm->plus_days(1)->with_time_zone_offset_same_instant($tz); # 86400 seconds from now in $tz

    Note that with_time_zone_offset_same_local may throw an exception here
    if the new local time does not exist in that time zone (e.g. between 2
    and 3 AM on the start of Daylight Savings Time).
