Apache-TieBucketBrigade version 0.01
====================================

Apache::TieBucketBrigade ties an IO::Handle to an Apache 2 bucket brigade 
in order to make building protocol handlers much simpler.

The test suite is currently broken, but I'm releasing to code anyway.  
Hopefully I'll figure out how to use Apache::Test to test protocol handers soon.
Help is appreciated.
