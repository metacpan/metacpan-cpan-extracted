    =head1 Description

    This module is enhancement of on original AI::ParticleSwarmOptimization
    to support multi-core processing with use of MCE. Below you can find
    original documentation of that module, but with one difference. There is
    new parameter "-workers", which one can use to define of number of
    parallel processes that will be used during computations.

    The Particle Swarm Optimization technique uses communication of the
    current best position found between a number of particles moving over a
    hyper surface as a technique for locating the best location on the
    surface (where 'best' is the minimum of some fitness function). For a
    Wikipedia discussion of PSO see
    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_swarm_optimization.

    This pure Perl module is an implementation of the Particle Swarm
    Optimization technique for finding minima of hyper surfaces. It presents
    an object oriented interface that facilitates easy configuration of the
    optimization parameters and (in principle) allows the creation of
    derived classes to reimplement all aspects of the optimization engine (a
    future version will describe the replaceable engine components).

    This implementation allows communication of a local best point between a
    selected number of neighbours. It does not support a single global best
    position that is known to all particles in the swarm.

Methods
    AI::ParticleSwarmOptimization provides the following public methods. The
    parameter lists shown for the methods denote optional parameters by
    showing them in [].

    new (%parameters)
        Create an optimization object. The following parameters may be used:

        *-workers*: positive number, optional
            The number of workers (processes), that will be used during
            computations.

        *-dimensions*: positive number, required
            The number of dimensions of the hypersurface being searched.

        *-exitFit*: number, optional
            If provided *-exitFit* allows early termination of optimize if
            the fitness value becomes equal or less than *-exitFit*.

        *-fitFunc*: required
            *-fitFunc* is a reference to the fitness function used by the
            search. If extra parameters need to be passed to the fitness
            function an array ref may be used with the code ref as the first
            array element and parameters to be passed into the fitness
            function as following elements. User provided parameters are
            passed as the first parameters to the fitness function when it
            is called:

                my $pso = AI::ParticleSwarmOptimization::MCE->new(
                    -fitFunc    => [\&calcFit, $context],
                    -dimensions => 3,
                );

                ...

                sub calcFit {
                    my ($context, @values) = @_;
                    ...
                    return $fitness;
                }

            In addition to any user provided parameters the list of values
            representing the current particle position in the hyperspace is
            passed in. There is one value per hyperspace dimension.

        *-inertia*: positive or zero number, optional
            Determines what proportion of the previous velocity is carried
            forward to the next iteration. Defaults to 0.9

            See also *-meWeight* and *-themWeight*.

        *-iterations*: number, optional
            Number of optimization iterations to perform. Defaults to 1000.

        *-meWeight*: number, optional
            Coefficient determining the influence of the current local best
            position on the next iterations velocity. Defaults to 0.5.

            See also *-inertia* and *-themWeight*.

        *-numNeighbors*: positive number, optional
            Number of local particles considered to be part of the
            neighbourhood of the current particle. Defaults to the square
            root of the total number of particles.

        *-numParticles*: positive number, optional
            Number of particles in the swarm. Defaults to 10 times the
            number of dimensions.

        *-posMax*: number, optional
            Maximum coordinate value for any dimension in the hyper space.
            Defaults to 100.

        *-posMin*: number, optional
            Minimum coordinate value for any dimension in the hyper space.
            Defaults to -*-posMax* (if *-posMax* is negative *-posMin*
            should be set more negative).

        *-randSeed*: number, optional
            Seed for the random number generator. Useful if you want to
            rerun an optimization, perhaps for benchmarking or test
            purposes.

        *-randStartVelocity*: boolean, optional
            Set true to initialize particles with a random velocity.
            Otherwise particle velocity is set to 0 on initalization.

            A range based on 1/100th of -*-posMax* - *-posMin* is used for
            the initial speed in each dimension of the velocity vector if a
            random start velocity is used.

        *-stallSpeed*: positive number, optional
            Speed below which a particle is considered to be stalled and is
            repositioned to a new random location with a new initial speed.

            By default *-stallSpeed* is undefined but particles with a speed
            of 0 will be repositioned.

        *-themWeight*: number, optional
            Coefficient determining the influence of the neighbourhod best
            position on the next iterations velocity. Defaults to 0.5.

            See also *-inertia* and *-meWeight*.

        *-exitPlateau*: boolean, optional
            Set true to have the optimization check for plateaus (regions
            where the fit hasn't improved much for a while) during the
            search. The optimization ends when a suitable plateau is
            detected following the burn in period.

            Defaults to undefined (option disabled).

        *-exitPlateauDP*: number, optional
            Specify the number of decimal places to compare between the
            current fitness function value and the mean of the previous
            *-exitPlateauWindow* values.

            Defaults to 10.

        *-exitPlateauWindow*: number, optional
            Specify the size of the window used to calculate the mean for
            comparison to the current output of the fitness function.
            Correlates to the minimum size of a plateau needed to end the
            optimization.

            Defaults to 10% of the number of iterations (*-iterations*).

        *-exitPlateauBurnin*: number, optional
            Determines how many iterations to run before checking for
            plateaus.

            Defaults to 50% of the number of iterations (*-iterations*).

        *-verbose*: flags, optional
            If set to a non-zero value *-verbose* determines the level of
            diagnostic print reporting that is generated during
            optimization.

            The following constants may be bitwise ored together to set
            logging options:

            *   kLogBetter

                prints particle details when its fit becomes bebtter than
                its previous best.

            *   kLogStall

                prints particle details when its velocity reaches 0 or falls
                below the stall threshold.

            *   kLogIter

                Shows the current iteration number.

            *   kLogDetail

                Shows additional details for some of the other logging
                options.

            *   kLogIterDetail

                Shorthand for "kLogIter | kLogIterDetail"

    setParams (%parameters)
        Set or change optimization parameters. See *-new* above for a
        description of the parameters that may be supplied.

    init ()
        Reinitialize the optimization. init () will be called during the
        first call to optimize () if it hasn't already been called.

    optimize ()
        Runs the minimization optimization. Returns the fit value of the
        best fit found. The best possible fit is negative infinity.

        optimize () may be called repeatedly to continue the fitting
        process. The fit processing on each subsequent call will continue
        from where the last call left off.

    getParticleState ()
        Returns the vector of position

    getBestParticles ([$n])
        Takes an optional count.

        Returns a list containing the best $n particle numbers. If $n is not
        specified only the best particle number is returned.

    getParticleBestPos ($particleNum)
        Returns a list containing the best value of the fit and the vector
        of its point in hyper space.

            my ($fit, @vector) = $pso->getParticleBestPos (3)

    getIterationCount ()
        Return the number of iterations performed. This may be useful when
        the *-exitFit* criteria has been met or where multiple calls to
        *optimize* have been made.

BUGS
    None... I hope.

    If any: A small script which yields the problem will probably be of
    help.
