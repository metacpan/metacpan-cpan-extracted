Scalar-Validation version 0.700
==============================

Scalar::Validation makes validation of scalar values or function (sub)
parameters easy, is fast and uses pure Perl:

  my $param = par param => Int => shift;

It will die (by default), if shift returns something different than an Int.

Same for named parameters

  my $param = npar param => Int => \%options;

You can create own types/rules.  You can change behaviour for invalid
data detected, or switch checks totally off. In this case par()
returns immediately the given value.

  my $var = validate var => int => $box->get_input();

It uses pure Perl (no compilation needed), so you can run it from a
USB stick.
