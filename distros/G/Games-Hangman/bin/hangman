=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is yet another text-based implementation of the popular word game Hangman.
In Hangman, you guess a word letter-by-letter. There is a maximum of seven wrong
guesses. Each wrong guess will incrementally draw a figure of a man being hung.
What's different about this particular variant:

=over

=item * Wordlist is searched from C<Games::Word::Wordlist::*> modules

=item * Phraselist

Aside from words, phrases are also allowed. Non-letters will be revealed first.
Phraselists are searched in C<Games::Word::Phraselist::*> modules.

=back

=head1 OPTIONS
