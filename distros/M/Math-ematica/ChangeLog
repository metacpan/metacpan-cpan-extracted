	* Added rudimentary support for display packets

	* Removed bang line from install.pl and call it via $^X

	The last test did fail on every system were /usr/local/bin/perl
	was not a Perl binary compatible with the $^X perl.

	* New code to locate libML.a and mathlink.h

	The code to spot the files is even more ugly but works with at
	least one 5.0 Installation.

	* ematica.xs, emathica.pm: do not call LinkClose during global
	destruction.

	* ematica.pm: Solaris nroff seems to hav eproblems with the output
	generated for '=item C<something>'.

	* Makefile.PL: Added MAN3PODS to WriteMakefile call.  Newer
	versions of Perl would not generate manual pages without that.

	* Added ppport.h for compatibility with newer Perls.  Verified
	that the module works with Mathematica 4.0 for Solaris.
