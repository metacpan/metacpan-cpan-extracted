This is the Perl distribution RPG-Dice.

Installing RPG-Dice is straightforward.

## Installation with cpanm

If you have cpanm, you only need one line:

    % cpanm RPG::Dice

If you are installing into a system-wide directory, you may need to pass the
"-S" flag to cpanm, which uses sudo to install the module:

    % cpanm -S RPG::Dice

## Installing with the CPAN shell

Alternatively, if your CPAN shell is set up, you should just be able to do:

    % cpan RPG::Dice

## Manual installation

## Documentation

RPG-Dice documentation is available as POD.
You can run perldoc from a shell to read the documentation:

    % perldoc RPG::Dice
