The files in this directory provide tools for conjugating Portuguese
verbs and recognizing conjugated forms of these verbs.

- Conjugate.pm   is a perl module with low-level tools (see manpage)
- conjug         is a perl program that conjugates verbs (see manpage) 
- treinar        is a perl program that drills the user on conjugation. 
- UnConjugate.pm is a perl module with low-level tools.
- unconj         is a perl program that regcognizes conjugated verbs.


Quick demo :

perl -e 'use Lingua::PT::Conjugate; print conjug("programar","perfeito")'

programar :                                                          
perf         programei programaste programou programamos programaram

Requisites : 
    
    Perl 5.004 or greater. Maybe less will do.

                   Term::ReadKey modules. Term::ReadLine::Perl or
                   Term::ReadLine::Gnu are more friendly.

on conjugation, programming, on naming and on all relevant points.

  Thanks to Lupe Christoph <lupe@lupe-christoph.de> from
cpan-testers@perl.org and to Miguel Marques

  A big part of the list of verb infinitives comes from files used in
Ispell (shiva.di.uminho.pt/~jj/pln) and in Logos (www.verba.org,
www.logos.it).  these projects. Some verbs were removed and others
added by hand.

  A fix for the verb "pedir" was sent by Itai Nahshon <itai@siftology.com>
