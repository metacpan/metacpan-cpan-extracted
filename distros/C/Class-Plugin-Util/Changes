    -  Forgot to update Makefile.PL with the new dependency (Module::Find).
       Now we use Module::Build's create_makefile_pl => 'traditional' instead.

       See documentation for more infomration.
    -  Now depends on Module::Find v0.05.
    -  Now passes the new perlcritic policies.

    -  Renamed _require_class to require_class (an alias is mantained for
       backwards-compatability).
    -  Now exports require_class.

0.005  Sat Aug 11 11:50:00 AM 2007 [asksh@cpan.org]
    -  VERSION BUMP 0.005 Impact: None.
    -  TESTS: Test::Kwalitee, Test::Pod::Coverage, Test::Pod and
       Test::YAML::Meta now changed to author only tests.
    -  REMOVED DEPENDENCY: UNIVERSAL::require
         added new function instead: _require_class($class),
         as this does not add the require function to every single class.
         also it has a class name to filename cache, and tests if the
         class-name passed as parameter actually is a valid Perl class.

    -  REMOVED DEPENDENCY: Params::Util
       Stole _CLASS from Params::Util, as we don't wanna load all of it.
    -  Fixed up import to only load Carp when necessary.
