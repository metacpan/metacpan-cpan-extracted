 - Added: Marlin::X::Clone is bundled as a demonstration of the extension
   API (and because it can be useful).
 - Marlin now provides a rudimentary API for extension modules.
 - Stop using `mkopt` to parse parameters; do it more manually to allow
   some options to take a simple string as their value instead of requiring
   a reference.

   Moo roles.
