NAME

    TestML - A Generic Software Testing Meta Language

SYNOPSIS

        # file t/testml/encode.tml
        %TestML 0.1.0
    
        Title = 'Tests for AcmeEncode'
        Plan = 3
    
        *text.apply_rot13 == *rot13
        *text.apply_md5   == *md5
    
        === Encode some poetry
        --- text
        There once was a fellow named Ingy,
        Combining languages twas his Thingy.
        --- rot13
        Gurer bapr jnf n sryybj anzrq Vatl,
        Pbzovavat ynathntrf gjnf uvf Guvatl.
        --- md5: 7a1538ff9fc8edf8ea55d02d0b0658be
    
        === Encode a password
        --- text: soopersekrit
        --- md5: 64002c26dcc62c1d6d0f1cb908de1435

    This TestML document defines 2 assertions, and defines 2 data blocks.
    The first block has 3 data points, but the second one has only 2.
    Therefore the rot13 assertion applies only to the first block, while
    the the md5 assertion applies to both. This results in a total of 3
    tests, which is specified in the meta Plan statement in the document.

    To run this test you would have a normal test file that looks like
    this:

        use TestML;
        use t::Bridge;
    
        TestML->new(
            testml => 'testml/encode.tml',
            bridge => 't::Bridge',
        )->run;

    The apply_* functions are defined in the bridge class that is specified
    outside this test (t/Bridge.pm).

DESCRIPTION

    TestML is a generic, programming language agnostic, meta language for
    writing unit tests. The idea is that you can use the same test files in
    multiple implementations of a given programming idea. Then you can be
    more certain that your application written in, say, Python matches your
    Perl implementation.

    In a nutshell you write a bunch of data tests that have inputs and
    expected results. Using a simple syntax, you specify what functions the
    data must pass through to produce the expected results. You use a
    bridge class to write the data functions that pass the data through
    your application.

    In Perl 5, TestML is the evolution of the Test::Base module. It has a
    superset of Test:Base's goals. The data markup syntax is currently
    exactly the same as Test::Base.
