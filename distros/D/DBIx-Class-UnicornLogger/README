                                        # to SQL if show_progress is on.  Again, the
                                        # default is probably good enough.

                                        # be ellided and only show the new bind params

       format => '[%d][%c]%n ** %m',    # both format and multiline format take the

                                        # format is defined it will be used for each

                                        # will be used for the first line, and
                                        # multiline_format will be used for the rest

       },                               # passed along to the SQL::Abstract::Tree
                                        # constructor
       # any other args are passed through directly to SQL::Abstract::Tree
