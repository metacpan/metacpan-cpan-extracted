Release as v1.01.

Wed Apr 10 06:18:05 2002  Spider Boardman  <spider@Orb.Nashua.NH.US>

	* lib/Net/Gen.dat (BINMODE): Allow for PerlIO layers in binmode()
	calls.

	* Gen.xs: Update for 'loose' compiler I was using, exposed by
	complaints from users.  I don't think xsubpp should be re-arranging
	as much as it is, which is what caused the declaration in the
	middle of the block, but that's a whole different battle.

Release as v1.0.

Sat Mar 30 04:25:08 2002  Spider Boardman  <spider@Orb.Nashua.NH.US>

	* Makefile.PL: Override 'ci' rule to skip the .pm's.

	* MANIFEST: Add manifake for cleaner 'ci' handling.

	* Gen.dat, Gen.xs: Add AF_LOCAL & PF_LOCAL.

	* all the .dat files: Update the PODs.

Release as v0.932.

Wed Aug  2 12:42:36 2000  Spider Boardman  <spider@Orb.Nashua.NH.US>

	* lib/Net/Gen.dat: Update @EXPORT_OK with the SO_* values,
	which I'd somehow missed before.  Thanks to
	'"Ged the Grey's Hain" <Ged@FaerieMUD.org>' for the bug report.

Release as v0.931.

Sun Feb 20 18:40:17 2000  Spider Boardman  <spider@Orb.Nashua.NH.US>

	* MANIFEST: re-add the lib/Net.../*.pm files for the PAUSE indexer.

	* Makefile.PL (gen_pm_files): Don't push .pm files onto the
	@delfiles array, or they won't be in the kit to be indexed
	by PAUSE.

Release as v0.93.

Wed Jan 19 02:45:18 2000  Spider Boardman  <spider@Orb.Nashua.NH.US>

	* Makefile.PL (gen_pm_files): Create .pm files from .dat
	files, modifying the attribute lines appropriately depending
	on which version of perl we have.

	* MANIFEST: Replaced .pm files with .dat files.

	* lib/Net/Gen.dat: replaced .pm files with .dat files, so
	that C<sub : attrlist> vs. C<use attrs qw(attrlist)> problems
	wouldn't give multiple warnings with 5.5.640.  Also made
	conversion of lib/attrs.dat to lib/attrs.pm dependent on
	whether we were going to install attrs.pm.
	lib/Net/**.dat: re-formatted attribute information and many
	subroutine headers for automated conversion from .dat to .pm
	files with the proper application of subroutine attributes.

Release as v0.92.

Internal snaphost as v0.9111.

	* lib/Net/Gen.pm: Bump version for next snapshot.

	* Gen.xs (BAD_TCP_MSS): Fix to undef TCP_MSS after netgen.h
	includes possible broken system .h files, and replace TCP_MSS
	with TCP_MSS_IETF.

	* Makefile.PL (%defdefines): Add TCP_MSS_IETF to hold the proper
	value, so that we can fix older Linux systems.

Internal snapshot as v0.9110.

Wed Aug  4 00:38:43 1999  Spider Boardman  <spider@Orb.Nashua.NH.US>

	* t/01unix.t (t_chk_hello_dgram): Don't hang in the receive if the

	* t/00basic.t: Update method of returning error when not all tests
	succeed.

	* t/01unix.t: Slight tweak to return error status if not all tests

	* t/00basic.t: Add a simple RCS string for the curious.

	* t/01unix.t: Clean up to avoid possible clashes with Socket and
	Net::Gen after adding the new constants to the latter.  Add a
	simple RCS string for the curious.

	* lib/Net/UNIX/Server.pm: Make Version() a constant sub.
	Streamline AUTOLOAD a bit.  Remove Socket dependencies.  Add a
	simple RCS string for the curious.

	* lib/Net/TCP/Server.pm: Make Version() a constant sub.
	Streamline AUTOLOAD a bit.  Remove Socket dependencies.  Add a
	simple RCS string for the curious.

	* lib/Net/UNIX.pm: Clean up Socket dependencies by using new XS
	constants.  Streamline AUTOLOAD a bit.  Set netgen_fakeconnect for
	SOCK_DGRAM sockets.  Make Version() a constant sub.  Add a simple
	RCS string for the curious.

	* lib/Net/UDP.pm: Streamline AUTOLOAD a bit.  Set
	netgen_fakeconnect for datagram sockets.  Reduce dependency on
	Socket by using new XS constants.  Make Version() a constant sub.
	Add a simple RCS string for the curious.

	* lib/Net/TCP.pm: Reduce dependency on Socket by using new XS
	constants.  Streamline AUTOLOAD a bit (for future use).  Make
	Version() a constant sub.  Add a simple RCS string for the
	curious.

	* lib/Net/Inet.pm: Make Version() a constant sub.  Reduce Socket
	dependencies by using new XS constants.  Streamline AUTOLOAD a
	bit.  Add a simple RCS string for the curious.

	* lib/Net/Gen.pm: Reduce bloat from Socket by adding new XS
	constants for various values.  Add new export tags for the new
	constants.  Add some missing sockopts.  Start implementing
	netgen_fakeconnect object parameter for UDP versus Solaris 2.5.1.
	Update POD for the new constants, export tags, and socket options.
	Make Version() a constant sub.  Streamline initsockopts() a bit.
	Add a simple RCS string for the curious.

	* Makefile.PL: Clean up PREOP and POSTOP, since the previous
	write-enabling was a bad idea with RCS.  Add a simple RCS header
	for the curious.

	* Gen.xs: Use constants for several things we used to get from
	Socket, since the latter doesn't make them into constant subs.
	Add a simple RCS header for the curious.

Sat Feb 27 02:08:01 1999  Spider Boardman  <spider@Orb.Nashua.NH.US>

	* lib/Net/Inet.pm (_setport): Correct dependency on hash
	ordering which caused some connects not to happen because the
	port got set after the host, and the host was 0.
	(_sethost): Fixed up gotcha with binding to just a port or
	just a host.
	(_setproto): Slight improvement to use a hash-slice delete
	when clearing protocol information.  Improve updating of
	the value to set at the epilogue.

	* All .pm files: Replace C<${*$self}> with C<*$self{HASH}>.
	It makes emacs happier with me, and it eliminates an annoying
	unoptimised block when single-stepping in the debugger.
	Rescinded upon realising that C<*$self{HASH}> has to generate
	a temporary to hold a newly-created RV.  Changed them to
	C<$ {*$self}>, which looks ugly but works with emacs.  I'll
	just have to live with the debugger wart.

	* lib/Net/UNIX/Server.pm: Get rid of `$myclass' in favour of
	__PACKAGE__.  Update copyright.  POD cleanup.

	* lib/Net/TCP/Server.pm: Get rid of `$myclass' in favour of
	__PACKAGE__.  Update copyright.  POD cleanup.

	* lib/Net/UNIX.pm: Get rid of `$myclass' in favour of
	__PACKAGE__.  Update copyright.  POD cleanup.  Added
	unbuffered_IO options (and PODs) a la Net::UDP, except
	that they only operate on non-SOCK_STREAM sockets.

	* lib/Net/UDP.pm: Get rid of `$myclass' in favour of
	__PACKAGE__.  Update copyright.  POD cleanup.
	(_addrinfo): Always obey the $numeric_only flag.

	* lib/Net/TCP.pm: Finish getting rid of `$myclass' in favour
	of __PACKAGE__.  POD cleanup.
	(_addrinfo): Always obey the $numeric_only flag.

	* lib/Net/Inet.pm: Finish getting rid of `$myclass' in favour
	of __PACKAGE__.  POD cleanup.

	* lib/Net/Gen.pm: Fix up studly caps in EXPORT_TAGS, allowing
	non_block_vals as well as NonBlockVals.  POD cleanup.
	Minor code tweaks for efficiency.  Bump version.

	* Gen.xs: Allow for 4.4bsd-style addressing in unpack_sockaddr().
	Minor cleanup.

Release as v0.91.  Now it should have non-blocking/timed connect logic
which works just about everywhere, as long as perl isn't built with SOCKS.
Maybe I'll move some of _valconnect into XS later, so that I have a shot
at detecting SOCKS and doing the right thing for that, too.  In the
meanwhile, it's back to trying to finish up a complete test suite for
this code, even though the two test scripts I already ship cover more than
was originally intended.

Wed Feb 24 22:41:17 1999  Spider Boardman  <spider@Orb.Nashua.NH.US>

	* lib/Net/TCP.pm: Disable C<use AutoLoader> until such time as
	we have real autoloadable subs again.  We still have &AUTOLOAD,
	but that's for the constants.  We don't autosplit anything, so
	why bother with running autosplit to create an empty index?

	* lib/Net/Gen.pm: Bump version for release.

Pre-release as 0.9007.

Wed Feb 24 10:08:50 1999  Spider Boardman  <spider@Orb.Nashua.NH.US>

	* lib/Net/Gen.pm: Bump version before I forget.
	(_valconnect): Don't try to read SO_ERROR if the select()
	call doesn't show the connect to have finished.  Solaris 2.5.1
	hangs the getsockopt in that case, even though the socket's
	non-blocking.

	* README: Added note about failure to handle non-blocking
	connect() with SOCKS.

Pre-release as 0.9006.

Wed Feb 24 09:27:05 1999  Spider Boardman  <spider@Orb.Nashua.NH.US>

	* lib/Net/Gen.pm: Fix botch in connect() causing attempts to
	finish pending connects to start new ones instead.  Bump
	version stamp for re-distribution.

Tue Feb 23 18:09:17 1999  Spider Boardman  <spider@Orb.Nashua.NH.US>

	* t/01unix.t: Ignore SIGPIPE while trying to figure out the
	non-blocking connect problem with Solaris.

	* Makefile.PL: Update to make the distribution write-locked
	by default, while keeping it write-enabled on my local disk.

	* lib/Net/Gen.pm: Update _tryconnect, add _valconnect.  Bump
	version stamp for pre-release testers.

Sat Feb 20 15:38:41 1999  Spider Boardman  <spider@Orb.Nashua.NH.US>

	* lib/Net/Gen.pm: Update test version stamp for pre-release
	testers.

	* MANIFEST.SKIP: Add some additional development directories to
 	keep out of the package.

	* t/01unix.t: Update test output to include full errno
 	descriptions.  Still trying to figure out why Solaris has to be so
 	different for making sockets work right.

Sun Feb 14 06:01:49 1999  Spider Boardman  <spider@Orb.Nashua.NH.US>

	* lib/Net/Gen.pm: Eliminate last uses of $myclass in favor of
	__PACKAGE__.
	(WRITE): Updated to default length argument now that syswrite
	does so.
	(initsockopts): localize $SIG{__DIE__} as well as __WARN__.
	(TIEHANDLE): Deal with being called with an object.

	* lib/Net/Inet.pm: Add IPPORT_DYNAMIC.

Sat Feb 13 16:22:44 1999  Spider Boardman  <spider@Orb.Nashua.NH.US>

	* t/01unix.t: Update to give test names with TEST_VERBOSE=1
	for better debugging (and better error reports).

	* t/00basic.t: Modified yet again, still trying to work around
	Solaris bug with socket emulation.

Fri Feb  5 02:32:09 1999  Spider Boardman  <spider@Orb.Nashua.NH.US>

	* lib/Net/TCP.pm: Updated copyright.

	* lib/Net/Inet.pm: Updated copyright.

	* MANIFEST.SKIP: Update to skip "Net-ext-<foo>" directories.

	* Makefile.PL (MY::libscan): Update to skip directories named
	"<foo>.ORIG" or "Net-ext-<foo>".

	* lib/Net/TCP.pm: Drop now-useless "used only once" hack
	now that it's been fixed in Gen.xs.

	* lib/Net/Inet.pm: Drop now-useless "used only once" hack
	now that it's been fixed in Gen.xs.

	* Gen.xs: Drop constant() entirely.  Replace with newmissing()
	in XS code and %_missing for AUTOLOAD().

	* lib/Net/Gen.pm: Bump version number.  Update AUTOLOAD() to
	use %_missing instead of constant().  Drop now-useless preinit
	seeding of missing routines, since they're always created in
	Gen.xs even when undefined.

Sun Jan 31 02:43:17 1999  Spider Boardman  <spider@Orb.Nashua.NH.US>

	* t/00basic.t: Work around Solaris bug with sockets-over-streams
	emulation for UDP sockets.  (bind required when using connect
	and defaulted addresses.)

Released as version 0.89, since 0.88 leaked out before it was ready.

Wed Nov  4 01:37:24 1998  Spider Boardman  <spider@Orb.Nashua.NH.US>

	* lib/Net/TCP.pm: Avoid "used only once" warnings for
	undefined XS constants.

	* lib/Net/Inet.pm: Avoid "used only once" warnings for
	undefined XS constants.

	* lib/Net/Gen.pm: Bump version number.  Update to avoid
	"used only once" warnings for undefined XS constants.

	* t/00basic.t: Update for Solaris bug with socket-over-stream
	emulation to not hang on test 16.

Wed Oct 21 04:16:48 1998  Spider Boardman  <spider@Orb.Nashua.NH.US>

	* README: Fix embedded test code in response to a bug report
	from Rob Hagopian <hagopiar@vuser.vu.union.edu>.

Released as version 0.87.  Critical to replace 0.86 because of
the typos in Gen.xs.

Thu Oct 15 04:26:49 1998  Spider Boardman  <spider@Orb.Nashua.NH.US>

	* lib/Net/TCP.pm: Suppress -w complaints about socket options which
	are not known on the current system (such as TCP_RPTR2RXT).

	* lib/Net/Gen.pm (_trace): Try to fix bogus tracing output in the
	debugger.

	* t/01unix.t: Update to unbuffer stdout.

	* Gen.xs: Fix typos for SHUT_* symbols.

	* lib/Net/Gen.pm: Update version stamp.

Released as version 0.86.  Further tests are needed, but the clean-up
work already done might be needed by other users.

Wed Oct 14 05:20:42 1998  Spider Boardman  <spider@Orb.Nashua.NH.US>

	* lib/Net/Gen.pm (shutdown): Slight clean-up for 'wasconnected'
	handling.  It's now down to a single hash, which is used in part
	for argument validation.

	* README: Add bug-report instructions relative to `perl -V'
	and `make test TEST_VERBOSE=1'.

	* t/00basic.t: Update to print Net::Gen::Version output
	under TEST_VERBOSE=1 so I can request better debugging info.
	Remove UNIX domain load tests for non-i_sysun systems.
	That's now tested in t/01unix.t anyway.

Fri Oct  2 20:53:12 1998  Spider Boardman  <spider@Orb.Nashua.NH.US>

	* lib/Net/Gen.pm (recv): Fix ->shutdown(0) to use SHUT_RD.

Thu Oct  1 17:28:19 1998  Spider Boardman  <spider@Orb.Nashua.NH.US>

	* Gen.xs: drop _xlate_shut_flag().

	* lib/Net/Gen.pm: Re-think _xlate_shut_flag.  Even XS subcall
	overhead is too high.  Just use a pair of hashes, and think about
	how to do a better job with the 'wasconnected' interface to
	eliminate the need for the conversions.

Wed Sep 30 18:40:41 1998  Spider Boardman  <spider@Orb.Nashua.NH.US>

	* lib/Net/Inet.pm: Updated pods.

	* lib/Net/Gen.pm: Added SHUT_RD, SHUT_WR, SHUT_RDWR, and the
	:shutflags export tag.  Updated pods.

	* Gen.xs: Added SHUT_RD, SHUT_WR, SHUT_RDWR, and the `private'
	routine _xlate_shut_flag().

	* lib/Net/UNIX.pm: Updated pods.

	* lib/Net/UNIX/Server.pm: Updated pods.

	* lib/Net/TCP/Server.pm: Updated pods.

	* lib/Net/UDP.pm: Updated pods.

Released as version 0.85.  The test suite still needs a lot more work,
but Perl v5.005 produced too many spurious warnings to ignore.

Wed Sep 30 00:23:19 1998  Spider Boardman  <spider@Orb.Nashua.NH.US>

	* lib/Net/Gen.pm: On second thought, the _autoload method
	interface is too slow.  Fix up the client AUTOLOAD's to
	stuff $Net::Gen::AUTOLOAD and goto &Net::Gen::AUTOLOAD
	directly.

	* lib/Net/TCP/Server.pm: No longer autoload new() && init().

	* lib/Net/UNIX/Server.pm: No longer autoload new() && init().

	* lib/Net/TCP.pm: Drop backward-compat for ::Server load.

	* lib/Net/UNIX.pm: Drop backward-compat for ::Server load.

	* lib/Net/*.pm: Made AUTOLOAD work with an _autoload method
	to silence the complaints about inheritance.

	* t/00basic.t: Expanded beyond loader tests to do simple
	message exchange over UDP sockets.

	* t/01unix.t: Added simple tests for UNIX-domain sockets.

Tue Sep 29 15:49:41 1998  Spider Boardman  <spider@Orb.Nashua.NH.US>

	* Makefile.PL: Changed minimum perl version to 5.004_05.

	* README: Noted update to 5.004_05.

	minimum perl version to 5.004_05.

	* lib/Net/UNIX/Server.pm: Add 'use attrs' for threads, bumping the
	minimum perl version to 5.004_05.

	* lib/Net/UNIX.pm: Add 'use attrs' for threads, bumping the
	minimum perl version to 5.004_05.

	* lib/Net/Inet.pm: Add 'use attrs' for threads, bumping the
	minimum perl version to 5.004_05.

	* lib/Net/Gen.pm: Fix up for 5.005 braindamage with respect
	to CORE::whatever functions.  Feh.  This advances the minimum
	version to 5.004_05, since I need to 'use attrs' for threads
	in 5.005.

Emergency release as version 0.84.  Begin work on real test suite for 0.85.

Sat Apr  4 00:36:44 1998  Spider Boardman  <spider@Orb.Nashua.NH.US>

	* lib/Net/Gen.pm: Added CLOSE, EOF, and WRITE for tied fh's.

	* MANIFEST: Added hints/linux.pl.

	* hints/linux.pl: Added to avoid TCP_MSS problems on Linux 2.0.30.

	and IPOPT_NUMBER.

	* Makefile.PL: Added note that DEFINE is expected to be overridden
	by hint files.

Released as version 0.82.

Sat Feb  7 14:56:06 1998  Spider Boardman  <spider@Orb.Nashua.NH.US>

	* lib/Net/UDP.pm: Fixed bug in READLINE reported by Olivier
 	Bodenreider <olivier@nlm.nih.gov>.  I really need to work on
	real regression tests soon....

	* lib/** except Gen.pm: Fix up indirect object syntax examples,
	and point people at the proto-FMTEYEWTK until Tom has the real one
	up on perl.com.

Released as version 0.81.

Thu Jan 29 00:17:08 1998  Spider Boardman  <spider@Orb.Nashua.NH.US>

	* README: Updated description & copyright.

	* ALL: Don't C<use Carp>!  Defer loading carp until we need it.
  	Done by providing carp & croak subs in the modules, and having
 	them be defined as C<require Carp> followed by the appropriate
 	C<goto &Carp::routine>.

	* lib/Net/Inet.pm: Cease getting SOMAXCONN from Socket.pm.

Wed Jan 28 23:47:57 1998  Spider Boardman  <spider@Orb.Nashua.NH.US>

	* Gen.xs: Added SOMAXCONN as a constant XSUB.

	* Makefile.PL: Added just-in-case default define for SOMAXCONN, so
 	that it can be a constant XSUB, too, rather then defined by eval()
 	in Gen.pm.

	* lib/Net/Gen.pm: Eliminated various redundant copies of the form
 	C<$fh = $self>.  Fix to generate proper errno in ->send when we
 	aren't connected and we have no dest-addr arg by just doing the
 	send anyway.  Removed eval() for SOMAXCONN, and stopped inheriting
 	it from Socket.pm.  We'll use another constant XSUB for it.

Wed Dec 24 01:16:18 1997  Spider Boardman  <spider@Orb.Nashua.NH.US>

	* lib/Net/Gen.pm: Converted from hashref with dependent globref to
 	globref with associated hashref.  Made to inherit from IO::Handle
 	so that the I/O will behave as people expect.  Updated the other
 	modules to compensate.  Removed some workarounds to 5.000 and
 	5.001 behaviour, since I'm requiring 5.004 (and finally noticed
 	that the old workarounds were still in place).

Thu Dec 18 16:21:21 1997  Spider Boardman  <spider@Orb.Nashua.NH.US>

	* lib/Net/UDP.pm: Added unbuffered options for ->PRINT() and
	->READLINE() via object parameters unbuffered_{input,output,IO}.

	* lib/Net/Gen.pm: Added default to reply address for ->send().
	Added tracking of OOB peer address in ->recv().

	* Gen.xs: Add MSG_OOB constant XSUB.

	* Makefile.PL: Added %defdefines entry for MSG_OOB.

Released as 0.80.  Next release will re-implement with a different internal
representation.  Be warned.  Use the documented interfaces only.

Sat Dec  6 06:05:01 1997  Spider Boardman  <spider@Orb.Nashua.NH.US>

	* lib/Net/UNIX/Server.pm: split off from UNIX.pm.

	* lib/Net/TCP/Server.pm: split off from TCP.pm.

	* Gen.xs:   Added ENOENT, EINVAL, and EBADF to the errnos.
	Reverted to XS for unpack_sockaddr_in and _pack_sockaddr_in.

	* lib/Net/Inet.pm: Made ->init's acceptance of ->isconnecting
 	conditional on being non-blocking.  Revert to XS help for
	unpack_sockaddr_in and pack_sockaddr_in.

	* lib/Net/UNIX.pm: Made ->init's acceptance of ->isconnecting
	conditional on being non-blocking.

	* lib/Net/Gen.pm: Add accessor function simulation to AUTOLOAD
 	with the use of the new _accessor() routine.  Now single-key
 	setparam & getparam calls are even easier.
	[Example: $self->timeout(20)]
	Added ->wasconnected.  Made ->connect re-try for ->isconnecting
	sockets.  Made timeout of 0 try only one address.  Merged ->send
	and ->SEND.  Made ->sendto autoloaded.  Added EINVAL, EBADF, and
	ENOENT to the :errnos list.

Released as 0.79.

Wed Nov 26 00:57:12 1997  Spider Boardman  <spider@Orb.Nashua.NH.US>

	* lib/Net/UDP.pm: Added localisation of $! around undef'ing $self
 	to preserve the errno value in the ->new method.

	* lib/Net/TCP.pm: Added localisation of $! around undef'ing $self
 	to preserve the errno value in the ->new method.

	* lib/Net/Inet.pm: Added localisation of $! around undef'ing $self
 	to preserve the errno value in the ->new method.

	* lib/Net/UNIX.pm: Fixed 'type' param initialisation so that
	the 'new' routine doesn't return undef because ->open failed.
	Added localisation of $! around undef'ing $self to preserve
	the errno value in the ->new and ->init methods.

	* lib/Net/Gen.pm: Added ->isconnecting method, and added timeouts
 	and the blocking object parameter.  Added localisation of $!
  	around undef'ing $self to preserve the errno value in the ->new
 	and ->init methods.  Tweaked STORE method to avoid passing undef
 	to ->put.

Tue Nov 25 00:24:59 1997  Spider Boardman  <spider@Orb.Nashua.NH.US>

	* Gen.xs: Added socket-related errno values to the Net::Gen UV
 	constant definitions.

	* Makefile.PL: Added socket-related errno values to be defaulted
 	to 0 if not present in sys/errno.h or net/errno.h.

	* lib/Net/TCP.pm: Made server-new set the reuseaddr parameter.

	* lib/Net/UNIX.pm: Cleaned up some interpolations of undef for -w.
	Made server-new set the reuseaddr parameter.

	* lib/Net/UDP.pm: Slight doc tweak.

	* lib/Net/Inet.pm: Cleaned up some interpolations of undef for -w.

	* lib/Net/Gen.pm: Added reuseaddr param key.  Added :errnos tag
 	for socket-related errno values, and added those errnos to
 	@EXPORT_OK.

Mon Nov 24 23:39:23 1997  Spider Boardman  <spider@Orb.Nashua.NH.US>

	* lib/Net/Gen.pm: Cleaned up some interpolations of undef for -w.
  	Fixed some doc typos.

Released as 0.78.

Mon Jul 14 21:28:00 1997  Spider Boardman  <spider@Orb.Nashua.NH.US>

	* README: Pointed harder at Makefile.PL for instructions about
	adding new system headers.

	* Makefile.PL: Added check for netinet/ip_tcp.h as contributed by
	Christopher F. Miller <cfm@maine.com>.  Added additional text
	near "my @hfiles" describing what a user might need to do in
	order to get a good build on a "new port".  Added perl version
	check here to keep people from trying to compile under 5.003 despite
	what the README says.

Mon May 19 05:22:54 1997  Spider Boardman  <spider@Orb.Nashua.NH.US>

	* Makefile.PL: Added check for <netinet/in_system.h>.

Sun May 18 04:49:17 1997  Spider Boardman  <spider@Orb.Nashua.NH.US>

	* lib/Net/Inet.pm: Updated to require 5.00399 and use __PACKAGE__
        for $myclass setup.  Added 'desthost=>"host:port(n)"' handling.
        Added default ports for services known from IANA's list.

Sat May 17 20:27:23 1997  Spider Boardman  <spider@Orb.Nashua.NH.US>

	* lib/Net/Gen.pm: Updated pods.  Most significant change was to
	re-arrange the routines to be listed alphabetically, since there
	are so many of them.  Added a 'functional grouping' intro to the
	'public methods' section.  Made SEND autoloaded.  Updated to
	require 5.00399 because of TIEHANDLE support.  Because of being
	post-5.00394, switched from godawful caller()-abuse to __PACKAGE__
	for $myclass initialisation.

Fri May 16 01:01:10 1997  Spider Boardman  <spider@Orb.Nashua.NH.US>

	* lib/Net/Gen.pm: Tweak pod entry for PRINTF to avoid bogus
        warning from pod2man.

Fri May  2 14:12:54 1997  Spider Boardman  <spider@Orb.Nashua.NH.US>

	* lib/Net/Gen.pm (READLINE): Fixread READLINE vs. getline so
	that READLINE respects wantarray as the tied-fh internals
	expect.  Updated pods for tied-fh methods.

Thu May  1 02:14:14 1997  Spider Boardman  <spider@Orb.Nashua.NH.US>

	* lib/Net/Gen.pm: Some additional support for tied filehandles.
	Now have TIEHANDLE, READ, PRINTF, and GETC.  READLINE is still
	scalar-context-only, and these new methods need docs.

Wed Apr 30 21:11:15 1997  Spider Boardman  <spider@Orb.Nashua.NH.US>

	* lib/Net/Gen.pm (sub listen): Applied patch from Eric Anderson
	<eanders@cs.berkeley.edu> to eliminate warning with respect to
	$$self{didlisten} (quotes got added).

Released as version 0.77 as this part of development now seems stable.

Sat Apr  5 01:58:20 1997  Spider Boardman  <spider@Orb.Nashua.NH.US>

	* README: Added a copyright statement as per the recommendations
        in the module list.

	* lib/Net/Inet.pm: Missed INADDR_UNSPEC_GROUP before.

	* Gen.xs: Consolidated the BOOT: sections for better compilation
        performance.

Fri Apr  4 12:47:18 1997  Spider Boardman  <spider@Orb.Nashua.NH.US>

	* Makefile.PL: Added MY::libscan to keep my local 'make install'
        working despite my backup files.

	* lib/Net/Gen.pm: Fixed up the RECV method so that its calling
	sequence is appropriate for tied FH support, instead of matching
	the recv method.  Updated the pod accordingly.

	* lib/Net/UDP.pm: Updated the new/init handling to set IPproto as
	well as proto (just in case).

	* lib/Net/UNIX.pm: Updated the bind and connect methods to allow
	additional parameter setting, as in Inet.pm.  Updated the pods to
	match.

	* lib/Net/TCP.pm: Slight pod cleanup.

	* lib/Net/Inet.pm: Updated general pod for the IN_MULTICAST() and
	IPOPT_COPIED() additions, along with the IP multicast addresses.

	* README: Updated for items which are (mostly?) done.

Limited private release as 0.76 with these changes except for the ChangeLog.

Fri Apr  4 12:28:57 1997  Spider Boardman  <spider@Orb.Nashua.NH.US>

	* lib/Net/UNIX.pm: Updated EXPORT_TAGS and related pod.

	* lib/Net/TCP.pm: Updated EXPORT_TAGS and related pod.

	* lib/Net/Inet.pm: Updated EXPORT_TAGS and related pod.

	* lib/Net/Gen.pm: Updated EXPORT_TAGS and related pod.  Changed
	initsockopts to use a generated closure in the caller's package to
	evaluate the proposed socket options.  I'm not convinced whether
	this is better than the previous can() method, though.  Some
	profiling is required, along with testing the behaviour of each
	style under pathological conditions.

	* Gen.xs: Removed entries in constant() which will (now) never be
        missing from the rest of the generated file.  Added entries for
        the 1-arg macros, and a few new constants (such as IPOPT_CIPSO and
        INADDR_ALLRTRS_GROUP).  Added support for sv_inaddr_t / T_INADDR
        typemap (routine sv2inaddr) so that IN_CLASSD() and friends can
        take a local-byte-ordered UV or a PV which is returned by
        Socket::inet_aton() or unpack_sockaddr_in() which is in network
        byte order.

	* Makefile.PL: Added code to create "netgen.h" for #include, in
        support of finding local .h files and generating default values
        for system-independent symbols.  This means that I have #defines
        which duplicate the anonymous enums used in Linux, but that's
        life.  The macros generated in netgen.h allow me to support some
        of the 1-argument macros, too, such as IN_CLASSD() and
        IPOPT_COPIED().

	* typemap: Add sv_inaddr_t / T_INADDR mapping for the new
        IN_CLASSD() and related predicate functions.

Released as version 0.75 (still alpha) because of perl 5.003_96 & AUTOLOAD.

Tue Apr  1 00:53:05 1997  Spider Boardman  <spider@Orb.Nashua.NH.US>

	* README: Add a note about the Linux issue, and configuration
	problems with tracking down the right <*.h> files.

	* lib/Net/UNIX.pm: Hoisted initialisation, and corrected for the
        non-inherited AUTOLOAD problem.  Minor additional cleanup so that
        it will work with autosplit now.

	* lib/Net/UDP.pm: Hoisted initialisation, and corrected for the
        non-inherited AUTOLOAD problem.

	* lib/Net/Inet.pm: Hoisted initialisation, and corrected for the
	non-inherited AUTOLOAD problem.  Made auto-split, as well.

	* lib/Net/Gen.pm: Hoisted some things into BEGIN {} blocks so that
	should-be-constant subs (and xsubs) will be.

	* Gen.xs (cv_constant): Fixed up the constant XSUBs.  Now they
	really are.

Sun Mar 30 20:34:35 1997  Spider Boardman  <spider@Orb.Nashua.NH.US>

	* lib/Net/Gen.pm: Revamped a lot of calling sequences to be a
	strict match for the docs, after cleaning up the few remaining
	errant calls in my own code.  This streamlined a lot of the
	methods, so some fairly common operations should be faster now.
	Also fixed up references to $myclass so that the "should be
	autoloaded" functions can be.  In fact, now they are.  Added the
	condition() method, so that the autoflush() and binmode() calls in
	accept() and open() can be abstracted.  Some sub-classes may only
	need to override (or augment) condition() now rather than both
	open() and accept().

Turned loose as version 0.74 (still alpha because of the Linux problem).

Fri Mar 28 21:48:53 1997  Spider Boardman  <spider@Orb.Nashua.NH.US>

	* Gen.xs: Revamp `constant' subs for easier auto-generation.
	Still to do: mark them as constant.

	* lib/Net/Gen.pm: Fix up eof handling in get().  Fix up
	subclass new() call in accept().  Eliminate private gensym
	emulation and just use Symbol::gensym().  Document the new
	ckeof() method.

Thu Mar 27 02:12:41 1997  Spider Boardman  <spider@Orb.Nashua.NH.US>

	* lib/Net/Gen.pm: Declare missing constant routines so that they
	have the right prototypes.

	* lib/Net/TCP.pm: Declare routines which need to go through
	constant() so that they always have the same prototype.

	* Gen.xs (constant): Create routines for the constants which are
        defined, so that we only call constant() in the AUTOLOAD routine
        for missing macros.

Tue Mar 25 11:50:01 1997  Spider Boardman  <spider@Orb.Nashua.NH.US>

	* README: Updated.

	* lib/Net/UNIX.pm: Finished the promised routines in the pod.
	Cleaned up for new distribution structure.

	* lib/Net/UDP.pm: Clean up for new distribution structure.
	Query--Does this module need a Server sub-class like the TCP one?

	* lib/Net/TCP.pm: Clean up for inherited autoloader.  Some pod
        updates.

	* lib/Net/Inet.pm: Add exporter tags.  Fix up to use more of the
        routines which are in Socket (and which work well enough for me
        now).  Significant pod updates.  In _setport, allow port/service
        args like 'http(80)' for parity with IO::Socket.  In getsockinfo,
        update the lcl* parameters if we have a binding, even if the
        remote info is not available because we're not connected.

	* lib/Net/Gen.pm: Fix paragraph-mode mismatch in getline().  Make
	DESTROY() be null, since de-refs will do the right thing more
	efficiently than the explicit Perl code which used to be there.
	Significant pod updates.

	* Gen.xs: Eliminate 'privatized' versions of things in Socket.
        I'm cleaning up the alternate versions now that Socket works.

	* Makefile.PL: Restructure distribution layout to be friendly to
        CPAN.pm.  This also eliminates all the .xs files except for
        Gen.xs, which now has all the constants.  This makes for only one
        loadable library, which should be more efficient.  The Net::Dnet
        module has been split out into a separate distribution.

This was 'released' as version 0.72 (a.k.a alpha 8).

Sun Dec 22 09:58:02 1996  Spider Boardman  <spider@Orb.Nashua.NH.US>

	* Snapshot work-in-progress, even though should be updated
	for 5.003_13, since I'll be away for a while.

Wed Jul 24 03:29:13 1996  Spider Boardman  <spider@Orb.Nashua.NH.US>

	* Dnet/Dnet.pm: Clean up some {'word'} and {'key'=>val} stuff.

	* TCP/TCP.pm: Clean up some {'word'} and {'key'=>val} stuff.

	* Inet/Inet.pm: Clean up some {'word'} and {'key'=>val} stuff.

	* Gen/Gen.pm: Clean up some {'word'} and {'key'=>val} stuff.

Tue Jul 23 10:52:38 1996  Spider Boardman  <spider@Orb.Nashua.NH.US>

	* Contents: Remove pad_lexicals patch, since that fix is obsolete
        with 5.003.

Sun Jul 21 02:48:39 1996  Spider Boardman  <spider@Orb.Nashua.NH.US>

	* Gen/Gen.pm: Fix old bug with OOB messages and 'lastFrom'
        handling with respect to recv.

Sat Jul 20 19:32:15 1996  Spider Boardman  <spider@Orb.Nashua.NH.US>

	* Gen/Gen.pm: Begin updating for 5.003 language features (like
        SUPER:: and anonymous globs.)

	* UNIX/UNIX.pm: Begin updating for 5.003 language features (like
        SUPER:: and anonymous globs.)

	* Dnet/Dnet.pm: Begin updating for 5.003 language features (like
        SUPER:: and anonymous globs.)

	* Inet/Inet.pm: Begin updating for 5.003 language features (like
        SUPER:: and anonymous globs.)

	* UDP/UDP.pm: Begin updating for 5.003 language features (like
        SUPER:: and anonymous globs.)

Sun Jul 14 14:33:07 1996  Spider Boardman  <spider@Orb.Nashua.NH.US>

	* TCP/TCP.pm: Fixed bug formerly patched in private testing kits
        which prevented passing parameters to Net::TCP::Server::new and
        having them take effect.
	Begin updating for 5.003 language features (like SUPER:: and
        anonymous globs.)

	* Dnet/Makefile.PL: Upgraded to MakeMaker 5.34.

	* UNIX/Makefile.PL: Upgraded to MakeMaker 5.34.

	* UDP/Makefile.PL: Upgraded to MakeMaker 5.34.

	* TCP/Makefile.PL: Upgraded to MakeMaker 5.34.

	* Inet/Makefile.PL: Upgraded to MakeMaker 5.34.

	* Gen/Makefile.PL: Upgraded to MakeMaker 5.34.

Thu Jun  1 03:38:49 1995  Spider Boardman  <spider@Orb.Nashua.NH.US>

	* Inet/Inet.xs: Added _inet_aton() for performance.

	* Inet/Inet.pm: Moved some of inet_aton() into XSUB for
	  performance.

	* TCP/TCP.pm: Worked up Net::TCP::Server sub-module for easier
	  server creation.

Sun May 28 18:35:42 1995  Spider Boardman  <spider@Orb.Nashua.NH.US>

	* Gen/Gen.pm: -w fixup in getline for (undef $/) case.
	  Add aliases for registerOptions and similar mixed-case methods
	  to allow names like "register_options" for those who prefer that.
	  Updated the pod for the alias methods and a discussion of the use
	  of the fileno method and/or the embedded filehandle.
	  Added new_from_fh method and pod info.

Sat May 27 02:30:46 1995  Spider Boardman  <spider@Orb.Nashua.NH.US>

	* TCP/TCP.pm: 'use strict' fix for select() in accept method.

Mon Apr 17 02:58:40 1995  Spider Boardman  <spider@Orb.Nashua.NH.US>

	* version 0.51-alpha released.

Mon Apr 10 17:45:29 1995  Spider Boardman  <spider@Orb.Nashua.NH.US>

	* Contents: Changed to unpack into Net/ rather than ext/Net/, to
	  be friendlier to people who are building this stuff as loadable
	  pieces separate from the Perl distribution.

	* Gen/Gen.pm: More -w fixups (missed by perl -wc).

Sat Apr  8 11:26:48 1995  Spider Boardman  <spider@Orb.Nashua.NH.US>

	* UDP/Makefile.PL: Hack up to be in the same directory tree,
	  even though it doesn't have a .xs file.

	* UDP/UDP.pm: Make ready for exposure to the world.

	* Inet/Inet.pm: Add wrapper for pack_sockaddr_in to make
	  the 'family' argument optional.

	* Inet/Inet.xs: Fix constant() to be U32 rather than double.
	  Privatize pack_sockaddr_in() to allow for optional sin_family.

	* TCP/TCP.xs: Fix constant() to be U32 rather than double.

Wed Apr  5 14:55:54 1995  Spider Boardman  <spider@Orb.Nashua.NH.US>

	* TCP/TCP.pm: Remove TIESCALAR workaround, as either my
	  pad-lexicals patch fixed it or I'm no longer exercising the bug.

	* Inet/Inet.pm: Fix glitches with -w stuff.  Fix inet_aton not to
	  'use integer', as it loses the high-order bit.

	* Gen/Gen.pm: Fix glitches in the 'use strict' and -w stuff.

Mon Apr  3 02:22:21 1995  Spider Boardman  <spider@Orb.Nashua.NH.US>

	* Version 0.50-alpha released.

Mon Apr  3 02:00:25 1995  Spider Boardman  <spider@Orb.Nashua.NH.US>

	* README: Updated to reflect the need for a patched 5.001.

	* Contents: add pad-lexicals-patch for making 5.001 work for me.

	* TCP/TCP.pm: Undocument ``setdebug''.  It's a botch that's only
	  there because it helped me in figuring out where things were
	  dying while looking for bugs in perl itself.  It's not a
	  desirable feature for the modules.  Debug options should be
	  per-object if they exist.

	* Gen/Gen.pm: Finish fixing up for ``use strict'' where possible
	  after my posted patches for bugs found along the way.  Enough of
	  this now depends on working lexicals that it now requires 5.001
	  (with patches) to work.

Sat Apr  1 01:07:35 1995  Spider Boardman  <spider@Orb.Nashua.NH.US>

	* Gen/Gen.pm: Clean up for ``use strict'' and ``-w'' stuff.

	* Inet/Inet.pm: Clean up for ``use strict'' stuff.

	* TCP/TCP.pm: Clean up to make 'use strict qw(subs refs)' work.
	  Add 'use strict;' after AUTOLOAD.

Thu Mar 30 02:04:14 1995  Spider Boardman  <spider@Orb.Nashua.NH.US>

	* TCP/TCP.pm: Clean up -w warnings resulting from @ISA conflicts
	  between DynaLoader and AutoLoader.

	* Inet/Inet.pm: Clean up -w warnings resulting from @ISA conflicts
	  between DynaLoader and AutoLoader.

	* Gen/Gen.pm: Cleaned up a lot of warnings (-w).  Most of them
	  were "cleaned up" by being suppressed, since the overhead of
	  checking things in setparams to satisfy -w isn't really worth
	  it.  However, some of them were real, and worth fixing.

Mon Mar 27 01:51:58 1995  Spider Boardman  <spider@Orb.Nashua.NH.US>

	* Gen/Gen.pm: Fixed the pod a bit.

	* Inet/Inet.pm: Fixed format_addr to allow static-style calls as
	  per its documentation.

	* TCP/TCP.pm: Fixed a warning-causing typo, and fixed the pod a
	  bit.  Added _addrinfo hack for format_addr.

Sat Mar 25 11:34:26 1995  Spider Boardman  <spider@Orb.Nashua.NH.US>

	* Version 0.3-alpha released.

Sat Mar 25 11:34:26 1995  Spider Boardman  <spider@Orb.Nashua.NH.US>

	* Inet/Inet.pm: Moved IPVERSION to @EXPORT_OK.  Added format_addr.
	  Cleaned up some sign-extension problems.
	  Added keys {lcl,rem}{host,addr,service,port} and augmented
	  getsockinfo method to fill in the values.
	  Added key IPproto to store the name of protocol in use, and
	  made keys IPproto and proto inter-dependent.

	* Gen/Gen.pm: Don't allow getline's stashed buffer to interfere
	  with recv's involving MSG_OOB.  Clean up another eval to be more
	  efficient (compiled, not purely interpreted).  Clean up some
	  sign-extension problems.

	  Added format_addr, format_local_addr, format_remote_addr
	  methods.

Fri Mar 24 02:19:09 1995  Spider Boardman  <spider@Orb.Nashua.NH.US>

	* Gen/Gen.pm: Avoided some excessive warnings.
	  Added some error-checking to select and fhvec methods.

	* Inet/Inet.pm: Cleaned up some excess evals.

	* Inet/Inet.xs: Made {un,}pack_sockaddr_in more robust by using
