	- Fixed a few memory leaks caused by changes in 1.42 and
	  tested these changes on both Netscape and UMICH SDKs.
	- Changed the test.pl to be more intuitive and no longer require
	  modifications.
	- Made a few cosmetic changes to Makefile.PL

	  the get_all_values function.
	- Fixed a multitude of problems with rebinding
	- Resolved issue resulting in dumped core on modify where NULL
	  values were passed.
	- Much more extensive testing by the author against both Netscape
	  and University of Michigan libraries.  Many small corrections.
	- Added Makefile.PL options for Netscape LDAPv3 SDK.  No v3 calls
	  added yet.
1.40a Wed Jan 28 11:20:51 CST 1998
	- sort_entries and multisort_entries have been added with the single
	  arguments $attr and \@attr respectively.  Neither seem to work
	  properly on my system when sorting anything besides DN (attr =
	  non-null).  Please try this function on your system and let me
	  know if it you can get it to work.  If so, I will finish adding
	  this function with another argument to specify a perl based compare
          function for the sort.
	- Lots of changes from Hallvard B. Furuseth <h.b.furuseth@usit.uio.no>
          Including:
           o Got rid of extra checks in LDAPapi.pm where checks exist in
	      XS or Perl.
	   o Cleaned up ldap_<add/modify>[_s] with a few simple changes to
	      hash2mod() function.  Also fixed bug in that function that
	      causes problems when you supply an empty hash.
	   o Small typos and bug fixes in test.pl fixed.
	   o Error string is now retrieved when requested, rather than after
	      every call (What was I thinking when I did this?  Who knows....)
	   o Fixed some reverse logic in ldap_<set/get>_option in the XS file.
	- Changed memory related calls to use 'New' and 'Safefree' macros,
	  which seems to be what the perlguts document suggests.
	- Got rid of the ber_free define in ldap_compat.h when using UMICH.
	  This was causing core dumps on some platforms.
	- Added ldap_mod_attr.pl to the examples.  A wonderful script from
	  Andrew J Cosgriff <ajc@bing.wattle.id.au>.

1.40 Wed Jan 21 11:12:24 CST 1998
	- I never did include the new version of web500.pl that supports
          Add functionality.  It did exist, and I've included it with this
          release.
	- There was a bug when adding or modifying a record where the value
	  was set to be an integer.  The bug has probably existed since a very
	  old version of the module.  It has now been fixed.
	- Fix to internal rebind process for Netscape API users provided by
	  Rob Weltman <rweltman@netscape.com> of Netscape.

1.40beta Tue Jan 13 14:54:13 CST 1998
	- Wow, what hasn't changed in this version...
	- Removed the extra 'free' in ldap_get_dn that was submitted as
	  a fix to a memory leak.  The fix seems to give inconsistent results
	  on different platforms and APIs.
	- Added Perl-OO methods for virtually all API calls.  The C style
	  API calls still work, and will work in all future versions.
	  Note that I haven't added named arguments yet, so argument order
	  matters.  This should be in the next version.
	- Manpages completely rewritten.  Please send me any errors or typos.
	- All examples except the two web ones have been rewritten to run under
	  'use Strict'.
	- Test program and all examples except web500.pl have been rewritten
	  to use Perl-OO methods.  Might need to clean-up comments and code
	  after so many rewrites.
	- Minor bugfixes to web500.pl

1.39a Tue Nov 25 16:37:35 CST 1997
        - Version 1.39 "overimproved" memory handling.  It seemed to dump
          core, as it occasionally freed memory that Perl felt very inclined
          to freeing on its own.  Whoops!  This is only a bugfix release
          put out while I work on v1.40.
        - In the process of debugging, also changed several scripts to run
          under 'use strict' and 'perl -w'.

1.39 Mon Oct 27 15:33:12 CST 1997
        - Added Al Grimstead's memory leak fix for ldap_get_all_entries.
        - Added Windows NT 4.0 Support (using Perl5.004, not ActiveState Perl)
        - Added finished web500.pl Gateway
        - Improved memory handling in Add/Modify Routine
        - Included updatepw.pl in the examples directory.  This is a script
          that can syncronize unix passwords into directories supporting
          crypted passwords.

1.36 Fri Aug 29 14:54:38 CDT 1997
        - Added ldap_get_all_entries, which is not a C API command, but
          useful anyway.  Thanks to Andreas Beck for some of the code to
          make this possible.
        - Included a few new examples (ldapwalk2.pl and web500.pl)

1.35 Tue Aug 26 15:44:25 CDT 1997
        - Added SSL Functions when using Netscape SDK
        - Added the following functions for non-Netscape SDKs (and ensured
          that they now work properly for Netscape SDK users):
                ldap_get_lderrno (to get errno from LDAP struct)
                ldap_set_lderrno (to set errno from LDAP struct)
                ldap_msgid       (to obtain msgid from an LDAPMessage *)
                ldap_msgtype     (to obtain msgtype from an LDAPMessage *)
                ldap_set_option  (to set some LDAP * options)
                ldap_get_option  (to get some LDAP * options)
        - Added support for a rebind process.  Mostly untested, so let me know
          how well this works for you.  You can set this to a PERL routine
          using ldap_set_rebind_proc($ld,\&perl_function_name), then make
          sure that this function returns DN, PASSWORD, and AUTHTYPE.
        - Added more code and documentation fixes from Hallvard Furuseth
        - Fixed documentation/code errors noted by Al Grimstad <alg@att.com>
        - Added ldap_compat.h for non-Netscape SDK users.
        - Added Credits file containing people who have provided feedback
          and fixes.
        - Added Todo file containing list of things I'm working on (or
          would like to be working on).

1.31 Tue Jul 29 17:25:54 CDT 1997
        - Added function prototypes for internal functions so that some C
          compilers don't complain.
        - Fixed the ldap_*_option functions for Netscape SDK users.
        - Implemented fixes from Hallvard Furuseth <h.b.furuseth@usit.uio.no>
          for ISODE support and lots of code cleanup, including a very nice
          script to autogenerate a constant.h file.  THANKS!

1.30 Tue Jul 22 17:19:36 CDT 1997
        - Fixes Makefile.PL to add Kerberos libraries if needed.  Also added
          LDAP_AUTH_KRB* defines to LDAPapi.xs file.
        - Changed all malloc to PERL5 safe versions.
        - Now properly free all LDAPMod structures after ldap_add & ldap_modify
        - Completely rewrote add and modify routines and added binary value
          support to add and modify command
        - Added ldap_get_values_len function to support retrieving binary
          attributes.

1.21 Fri Jul 18 08:53:11 CDT 1997
        - Fixed the compile warnings with University of Michigan
        - Changed www-ldap.pl to only submit changed items.
        - Updated all files changing module name from LDAP to Net::LDAPapi

1.20 Thu Jul 17 01:20:08 CDT 1997
        - Changed LDAP.xs - added hash2add and hash2mod internal routines
          and seriously cleaned up the add and modify routines.
        - References to Arrays (\%) are now required as the third parameter
          to ldap_add* and ldap_modify* functions.
        - Updated README, Man Page in LDAP.pm, and other documentation
          changes.

1.11 Wed Jul 16 10:48:17 CDT 1997
        - Changed LDAP.xs and Makefile.PL to make this module work with
          University of Michigan LDAP SDK.  Tested on Solaris.
        - 'ldap_init' call does not seem to work properly if compiled with
          University of Michigan LDAP SDK.  Otherwise all OK.  Use ldap_open
          as a temporary work-around.

1.1  Tue Jul 15 17:54:27 CDT 1997
        - Fixed a few simple bugs in ldap_modify* and ldap_add* commands.
        - Included new www-ldap.pl CGI script
