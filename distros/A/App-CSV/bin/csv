=head1 NAME

csv - process CSV files from the command line

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  # On the command line:

  csv 1 2 -1 < report.csv

  # Reads the first two fields, as well as the last one, from "report.csv".
  # Data is cleaned up and emitted as CSV.

  csv --fields Revenue,Q1,Q2 < report.csv   # or "-f" for short

  # First line of the input (from file "report.csv") is considered as
  # header line; the fields are emitted in the order "Revenue", "Q1",
  # and "Q2". Data is cleaned up and emitted as CSV.

  csv --input report.csv --to_tsv

  # Converts the whole report to TSV (tab-separated values).

=head1 DESCRIPTION

CSV (comma-separated value) files are the lowest common denominator of
structured data interchange formats. For such a humble file format, it
is pretty difficult to get right: embedded quote marks and linebreaks,
slipshod delimiters, and no One True Validity Test make CSV data found
in the wild hard to parse correctly. L<Text::CSV_XS> provides flexible
and performant access to CSV files from Perl, but is cumbersome to use
in one-liners and the command line.

B<csv> is intended to make commandline processing of CSV files as easy
as plain text is meant to be on Unix. Internally, it holds two L<Text::CSV>
objects (for input and for output), which have reasonable defaults but
which you can reconfigure to suit your needs. Then you can extract just
the fields you want, change the delimiter, clean up the data etc.

In the simplest usage, B<csv> filters stdio and takes a list of integers.
These are 1-based column numbers to select from the input CSV stream.
Negative numbers are counted from the line end. Without any column list,
B<csv> selects all columns (this is still useful to normalize quoting
style etc.).

=head2 Command line options

The following options are passed to L<Text::CSV>. When preceded by the
prefix "output_", the destination is affected. Otherwise these options
affect both input and output.

=over 4

=item B<--quote_char>

=item B<--escape_char>

=item B<--sep_char>

=item B<--eol>

=item B<--always_quote>

=item B<--binary>

=item B<--keep_meta_info>

=item B<--allow_loose_quotes>

=item B<--allow_loose_escapes>

=item B<--allow_whitespace>

=item B<--verbatim>

=back

B<NOTE>: I<binary> is set to 1 by default in B<csv>. The other options have
their L<Text::CSV> defaults.

The following additional options are available:

=over 4

=item B<--input>, B<-i>

=item B<--output>, B<-o>

Filenames for input and output. "-" means stdio. Useful to trigger TSV mode
(C<--from_tsv> and C<--to_tsv>).

=item B<--columns>, B<-c>

Column numbers may be specified using this option.

=item B<--fields>, B<-f>

When this option is specified, the first line of the input file is
considered as a header line. This option takes a comma-separated list
of column-names from the first line.

For convenience, this option also accepts a comma-separated list of
column numbers as well. Multiple --fields options are allowed, and
both column names and numbers can be mixed together.

=item B<--from_tsv>, B<--from-tsv>

=item B<--to_tsv>, B<--to-tsv>

Use tabs instead of commas as the delimiter. When B<csv> has the input or
output filenames available, this is inferred when they end with C<.tsv>.
To disable this dwimmery, you may say C<--to_tsv=0> and C<--from_tsv=0>.
