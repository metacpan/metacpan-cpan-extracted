3.0       2019-07-18 16:16:50+01:00 Europe/London
 - documentation improvements
 - compatibility fix for Net::Stomp 0.60

2.9       2015-02-19 11:12:30+00:00 Europe/London
 - add receipt_timeout to TraceOnly, to support Net::Stomp 0.53

2.8       2015-01-26 18:09:55+00:00 Europe/London
 - add send_with_receipt to TraceOnly, require Net::Stomp 0.51

2.7       2014-07-29 10:46:22+01:00 Europe/London
 - use SingleEncoding (thanks sergeyromanov)

2.6       2014-07-14 17:16:36+01:00 Europe/London
 - require Net::Stomp 0.49
 - move failover handling to Net::Stomp, now that we know it works

2.5       2014-06-25 14:31:48+01:00 Europe/London
 - fix race-condition on tracing: write to a temporary file, then
   rename; this fixes some hard-to-reproduce problems when used in
   conjunction with Plack::Handler::Stomp::NoNetwork, which would read
   a new frame from disk before we've finished writing it

2.4       2014-03-10 10:33:41 Europe/London
 - RT #93698 fix dependency on newer List::Util for 'none' (thanks to
   Andreas J. König who did the work of figuring out the version
   before I even started looking into the problem)

2.3       2014-03-04 11:12:56 Europe/London
 - enable SSL connections, I had not noticed that there was no
   sensible way to set them up via these helpers

2.2       2014-02-25 15:03:27 Europe/London
 - you can now specify which frame types TracerRole will dump

 BREAKING CHANGES:
 - only SEND and MESSAGE frames will be dumped by default, set
   trace_types to [] to get the previous behaviour

2.1       2013-10-09 11:56:21 Europe/London
 - TraceOnly now emulates send_transactional as well as send

2.0       2013-05-23 22:19:12 Europe/London
 - TracerRole now allows you to specify the permissions for the
   directories of dumped files
 - fixed tests under Windows and other systems without POSIX file
   permissions

1.9       2013-05-16 17:36:57 Europe/London
 - TracerRole now allows you to specify the permissions for the dumped
   files

1.8       2013-03-01 15:46:59 Europe/London
 - ReadTrace::read_frame_from_* better detects broken or incomplete
   frames in files (fixes RT #83320)

1.7       2012-11-21 17:18:29 Europe/London
 - ReadTrace::clear_destination no longer removes the trace directory,
   it just empties it; this makes looking for files via
   File::ChangeNotify much simpler
 - ReadTrace::read_frame_from_filename returns nothing if the file
   can't be parsed as a STOMP frame

1.6       2012-10-24 15:28:25 Europe/London
 - die if undef or '' is passed as a destination to ReadTrace's methods

1.5       2012-10-19 17:00:42 Europe/London
 - avoid a "defined-or", it's not strictly necessary and breaks ancient
   perls

1.4       2012-09-03 21:00:19 Europe/London
 - lesson learned: never change your versioning scheme!

1.3.1     2012-09-03 11:44:11 Europe/London
 - ::TraceOnly broke ->connect, fixed now

1.3       2012-09-03 11:37:23 Europe/London
 - ->connect dies if the brokers returns an ERROR frame

1.2       2012-07-12 17:46:58 Europe/London
 - new method "clear_destination" on ReadTrace
 - make TraceOnly really always trace
 - accept destinations not starting with "/" in ReadTrace

1.1       2012-07-10 12:10:01 Europe/London
 - added ReconnectOnFailure, and moved some attributes around
 - 'connect' can now be called multiple times, and is a no-op if we're
   already connected

 BREAKING CHANGES:
 - 'tries_per_server' is gone (was not used)
 - 'connect_retry_delay' is moved to the new role

1.0       2012-03-24 11:02:54 Europe/London
 - first non-devel release

0.1_01    2012-03-14 11:49:53 Europe/London
 - Initial release
