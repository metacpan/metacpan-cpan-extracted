2.01      2020-12-06 00:39:19Z
  - better matching on files, directories to be ignored (e.g. no longer
    confuses directory "vincent" for "inc") - closes RT#133862, PR #1
  - handle long @INC lines by passing through $PERL5LIB (Father Chrysostomos,

  - Add 'no_test' import option to allow more composability
    (Arthur Axel fREW Schmidt)

1.5 2012-09-08
  - Change to default to searching for trailing whitespace from the
    current directory downwards (as tests are run from the top of a dist
    normally), rather than one directory above the test file, as then
    we don't work as expected if tests are in t/author or similar. RT#66177

    - Use binmode :raw for input/output. Solves win32 translating the
