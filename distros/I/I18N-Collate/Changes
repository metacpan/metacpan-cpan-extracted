  * First upload to cpan. Identical with version 1.01 in the perl core. Upstream
    for this module is still blead perl.
  * Note that this module is already deprecated in the perl core since at least
    1996. It's only being uploaded to CPAN to be able to remove it from the core
    eventually. I suggest you do not use it.
