0.54 2015-01-01

   weird) filename check. Fixed.

 - When cover option is passed, actually use it for the EPUB

0.52 2015-12-31

 - headings option now takes a value (but boolean still accepted)

0.51 2015-12-19

   title page, but append it to the end of the body.

0.50 2015-12-05

 - Handle partials

0.46 2015-12-02

 - Handle long author's name in documents, avoiding \maketitle
 - Added headings option to the template

0.45 2015-10-30

 - Fixed bug on fileparse() usage.

0.44 2015-10-28

 - Added class to parse the muse headers
 - Added methods to the template options to get some defaults

0.43 2015-10-15

 - Cleanup files left by previous compilation and remove LaTeX
   leftovers (.aux, .vrb, etc).

0.42 2015-10-14

 - "slides" is now an alias for "sl_pdf"

0.41 2015-10-14

0.40 2015-10-13

 - Updated styles for description lists
 - Internal refactoring for option handling
 - New option --purge to muse-compile

0.38 2015-08-26

 - Replaced EBook::EPUB with EBook::EPUB::Lite (to lighten up the
   dependecies, no XS).

0.37 2015-05-10

 - Added --luatex option to use lualatex instead of xelatex

0.36 2015-04-08

 - Adjusted definition of \forcelinebreak preventing a pagebreak after
   that. This could have some unwanted side effects in some corner
   case (like poetry overflowing).

0.35 2015-02-14

 - It looks like Archive::Zip 1.30 fails to extract the whole zip with
   the syntax $zip->extractTree('', $dest). This appears to work at
   least on 1.37 and 1.45 (latest). Changes file doesn't talk about
   this, though. 1.30 is shipped by debian, so we have to support
   this. Relevant tests updated.

 - Added support in the class and in the script for embedding fonts in
   the EPUB (--webfontsdir)

0.34 2015-02-12

 - Table of contents for EPUB now is properly nested

 - The compiler now can merge multiple texts into an EPUB. Merging
   into a single HTML document would require rewriting the footnotes
   reference and honestly doesn't make much sense.

0.33 2015-02-05

 - Fixed dumb validations for filename. This is still strict and
   probably will create validation problems on some setups (passing
   absolute filenames with spaces will fail miserably).

0.32 2015-02-03

 - Support for #hyphenation tag in the header. Dependency of
   Text::Amuse bumped because of needed hyphenation method.

0.31 2015-01-19

 - New option: opening (for chapter pages)
 - Interpret (via Text::Amuse) and so escape all the strings passed
   to the templates

0.30 2015-01-18

 - Downgraded requirement from Template to Template::Tiny. This change
   should produce a minor performance improvement (both speed and
   memory-wise) and, more important, pull out the complicated logic
   from the the LaTeX template into the code. This of course will
   prevent to do crazy stuff into the template. I see this as a
   feature. Eventually, if the need arise, there could be an option to
   use Template instead, given that the interface is the same. This is
   a major cleanup which has the potential to introduce bugs.

 - Added validation for extra values

0.27 2015-01-13

 - Fixed minor bug with missing cleardoublepage after title page
 - Prepared tests for upcoming downgrade from Template to Template::Tiny

0.26 2014-12-12

 - Fixed bug with missing escape in the epub's titlepage

0.25 2014-10-10

 - Fixed output out missing character report (missing newline)
 - Removed File::Slurp from the script

0.24 2014-09-08

 - LaTeX template change: reduced the footskip to 2 baselines.

0.23 2014-09-02

 - No code change. More verbose output in the methods.t which had a
   bunch of unexplicable test failing on windows.

0.22 2014-08-30

 - Added notoc option to suppress the table of content generation

0.21 2014-08-08

 - Changed default LaTeX class to book, even for texts without a table
   of contents. You can switch to the old behaviour either setting
   nocoverpage to a true value in the header or passing the extra key
   nocoverpage=1 to the compiler.

0.20 2014-07-26
 - Avoid useless and warmful decoding of TeX log file (known to have invalid utf8)

0.19 2014-07-20
 - Removed dependency on File::Slurp
 - Basic validation of extra options which enter the template not interpolated
 - Report missing fonts when compiling the PDF

0.18 2014-06-08
 - Set the language code in the html tag in the HTML output
 - Removed the need for a lock file using flock
 - Respect bcor and twoside option when building only plain pdf

0.17 2014-05-29
 - Added method to see if a file has already been compiled

0.16 2014-05-22
 - Adjusted logger

0.15 2014-05-17
 - Added --extra cover and --extra cover-width keys and documentation

0.14 2014-04-15
 - Adjusted code and tests for directory names with dots

0.13 2014-04-07
 - Restored slightly verbose logging
 - Added recursive compilation
 - Added --recursive and --dry-run to muse-compile.pl
 - Use a status file instead of dummy .ok
 - Added cleanup option to remove the status file
 - Decode --extra arguments passed on the command line
 - Hopefully fixed tests on Win32

0.12 2014-03-30
 - Remove the use of fork when compiling (save for the latex exec)
 - Improved logging

0.11 2014-03-23
 - Fixed test failures because of hash randomization

0.09 2014-03-22
 - Handle the merging of files in different languages

0.08 2014-03-16
 - New EXPERIMENTAL feature: file merging (only tex and pdf for now)

0.07 2014-03-08
 - New format: zip file with sources and attachments

0.06 2014-03-02
 - Removed noisy debug (leftover of the previous change)

0.05 2014-03-02
 - Force bcor=0mm and oneside=true for default .tex output
 - Renamed option size to papersize to avoid TT problems (which would interpret
   the size as the size of the options hashref

0.04 2014-03-01
 - Disabled testing with XeLaTeX by default and fixed localtime warning

0.03 2014-03-01
 - Added options to pass to the templates

0.02 2014-02-26
