Revision history for Perl extension Class::Tables.

0.28	Tue Jul 6 2004
	- Use diag() in test.pl instead of print
	- Schema cache with Storable
	- field() accessor update
	- undefs correctly handled as NULLs everywhere

0.27	Sat Feb 7 2004
	- More tests.
	- Can now manually skip test suite in Makefile.PL (for jeffa).
	- New Postgres support.

0.26	Thu Jan 22 2004
	- Added POD section about subclassing.
	- Optional "tablename_" prefix for any column (idea from Ron Savage).
	- Added support for SQLite, including first attempt to factor out
	  driver-specific stuff.
	- Changed interface for enabling/disabling Lingua::EN::Inflect stuff
	  and cascading deletes.

0.25	Sun Jan 12 2004
	- Test suite bugfixes.
	- Workaround for bizarro behavior with DBI::fetchall_arrayref.

0.24	Sat Jan 10 2004
	- DBI speedups & misc query optimizations.
	- Test suite rewrite & cleanup, now get database info for `make test`
	  from Makefile.PL (the *right* way (I think)).
	- Cascading deletes implemented.

0.23	Fri Dec 19 2003
	- Big change: pluralization using Lingua::EN::Inflect. See the massive
	  POD updates for what this means.
	- Near rewrite of the POD.
	- Different dump() method output, to better suit HTML::Template.
	- Modularized accessor type detection. This made it easy to allow more
	  flexible column naming. Now department_id column can be a foreign
	  key ref (accessor is still named department). Also the primary key
	  of the employee table can be employee_id.
	- Indirect (reverse-mapped) foreign keys can now take additional
	  query constraints.

0.22	Thu Oct 16 2003
	- An actual test suite, nice!
	- Whaddya know, the test suite found a bug in foreign key mutators.
	- POD updates, including adding a copyright notice. Oops!

0.21	Wed Oct 15 2003
	- First public release!
	- Decided on a name: Class::Tables.
	- Small improvements, like manual ref counting on the stub objects.

0.20	Complete rewrite, with a lot of new ideas. Inside-out objects to avoid
	concurrency problems, cached statement handles, etc. I posted an RFC on
	Perlmonks and got a fairly positive response so decided to clean it up,
	find a name, and release it.

A long long time ago:
	I wrote a little DB abstraction and called it MikeroDBI. I used it a
	lot. The actual code, however, was kinda nasty. We'll call these dark
	ages versions 0.0x through 0.1x.
