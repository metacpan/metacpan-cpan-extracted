    Thanks to Yanick Champoux for the following changes:
    - Added the loc_for() currying method to generate a localization function that
      translates to a specific language without having to specify it on every call.
    - Added the ability to translate arguments to placeholders without having to
      call loc() on the arguments as well. For example, instead of having to write
      $w->loc("I'm using %1", 'he', $w->loc('Linux', 'he')), you can now simply
      write $w->loc("I'm using %1", 'he', ['Linux']), and "Linux" will be translated
      to Hebrew as well before replacing the %1 placeholder.
    - Fixed a bug with definitions including 10 or more placeholders not being
      correctly filled out.

	  of other code in an application. Modification now localized.

1.000000  2014-04-08 19:08:18+03:00 Asia/Jerusalem
	- Added the ability to load localization data directly from a hash-ref, so data can
	  come from other sources except files (think databases).
	- The path paremeter to the new() constructor is now optional, as you can call the
	  (new) methods load_path() and load_structure() manually and as much as you want,
	  merging data from call to call. Backwards compatibility is kept.
	- Now using JSON instead of JSON::Any.
