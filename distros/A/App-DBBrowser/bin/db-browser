=head1 NAME

C<db-browser> - Browse SQL databases and their tables interactively.

=head1 VERSION

Version 2.323

=head1 SYNOPSIS

=head2 SQLite/MySQL/MariaDB/PostgreSQL/Firebird/DB2/Informix

    db-browser -h|--help

    db-browser

    db-browser database-name, ...

When the C<db-browser> is called with the argument C<-h|--help>, it shows a menu. The menu entry I<HELP> shows this
documentation - see L</OPTIONS>.

If C<db-browser> is called without arguments, the user can choose from the databases offered by the database plugin.

If C<db-browser> is called with arguments, the arguments are used as the available databases.

=head2 SQLite/Firebird

    db-browser -s|--search

C<db-browser> called with C<-s|--search> causes a new search for databases instead of using the cached data.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Before using C<db-browser>, make sure you backed up your databases.

Search and read in SQL databases: one can browse databases and their tables interactively.

C<App::DBBrowser> provides and supports plugins for the DBI drivers C<DBD::SQLite>, C<DBD::mysql>, C<DBD::MariaDB>,
C<DBD::Pg>, C<DBD::Firebird>, C<DBD::DB2> and C<DBD::Informix>. See L<App::DBBrowser::DB> how to write a database
plugin.

=head1 NAVIGATION

=head2 Menus

=over

=item *

the C<Arrow> keys (or C<h,j,k,l>) to move up and down and to move to the right and to the left.

=item *

the C<PageUp> key (or C<Ctrl-P>) to go to the previous page, the C<PageDown> key (or C<Ctrl-N>) to go to the next page.

=item *

the C<Home> key (or C<Ctrl-A>) to jump to the beginning of the menu, the C<End> key (or C<Ctrl-E>) to jump to the end
of the menu.

=back

With the option I<mouse> enabled it can be used the mouse with the left mouse key to navigate through the menus.

To confirm a chosen menu item use the C<Return> key.

In some sub-menus it is possible to select more then one item before C<Return> is pressed (e.g. the input filters
I<Choose Rows> and I<Choose Cols>); in such sub-menus the list of items marked with the C<SpaceBar> are added to the
chosen items when C<Return> is pressed. If a mouse mode is enabled, it can be used the right mouse key instead of the
C<SpaceBar>. A C<Ctrl-SpaceBar> inverts the made choices - so for example to select all but one select the one with the
C<SpaceBar> and then press C<Ctrl-SpaceBar>.

=head2 Read-line

=over

=item *

C<BackSpace> or C<Strg-H> to delete the character behind the cursor, C<Delete> to delete  the  character at point.

=item *

C<Strg-U> to delete the text backward from the cursor to the beginning of the line, C<Strg-K> to delete the text from
the cursor to the end of the line.

=item *

C<Right-Arrow> to move forward a character, C<Left-Arrow> to move back a character.

=item *

C<Page-Up> to move back 10 characters, C<Page-Down> to move forward 10 characters.

=item *

C<Home> or C<Strg-A> to move to the start of the line, C<End> or C<Strg-E> to move to the end of the line.

=back

To leave a C<read-line> without returning anything press C<Ctrl-X>. When the input puffer is empty and an C<Enter> is
pressed, C<read-line> returns an empty string.

=head1 OUTPUT

The elements are right-justified if they look like a number else they are left-justified.

If the option I<squash_spaces> is enabled, leading and trailing spaces are removed from the elements and spaces are
squashed to a single white-space.

Tab characters (C<\t>) are replaces with a space.

Vertical spaces (C<\v>) are squashed to two spaces

Control characters, code points of the surrogate ranges and non-characters are removed.

See also the option group L</Output>.

C<Ctrl-F> opens a prompt. A regular expression is expected as input. This enables one to only display rows where at
least one column matches the entered pattern. See option L</Search>.

=head1 WRITE ACCESS

=head2 Create/Drop Table/View

I<Create/Drop Table/View> can be reached by selecting the prompt-line in the L</Tables Menu> if the respective option is
activated.

Selecting the prompt line of the I<Create/Drop Table/View> sub-menu allows one to set the parse settings described in
L</Import>.

=head3 Create Table

If the option I<Source type> is set to I<menu>, selecting I<Create Table> opens a sub-menu where one can
choose the type of the data source. If I<Source type> is set to I<plain> or I<file>, the set data source
type is used automatically without showing a menu.

For the meaning of the different data source types see L<Source type>.

If the data has been read from a file, the user can apply different input filters (See L<Input filters>).

The user is then asked

=over

=item

for the table name

=item

if the first data row should be used as header

=item

if an auto increment column should be added (if the option L<Auto increment> is enabled)

=item

to edit the column names

=item

to edit the column data types

=item

to confirm the creating of the table

=back

=head3 Drop table

Drop a table. The whole table is shown before the user confirms to drop the table.

=head3 Create View

Before creating a view: print the required select-statement to make it available in the subquery menu.

=head3 Drop View

Drop a view. The whole view is shown before the user confirms to drop the view.

=head2 Insert Into/Update/Delete

I<Insert Into>, I<Update> and I<Delete> can be reached by selecting the prompt-line in the L</SQL Menu> if the
respective option is activated.

I<Delete>, I<Update> or I<Insert Into>  may not be available with C<JOIN> and C<UNION> statements.

Selecting the prompt line of the I<Insert Into/Update/Delete> sub-menu allows one to set the parse settings described in
L</Import>.

=head3 Insert Into

If the option I<Source type> is set to I<menu>, selecting I<Insert Into> opens a sub-menu where one can
choose the type of the data source. If I<Source type> is set to I<plain> or I<file>, the set data source
type is used without showing a menu.

For the meaning of the different data source types see L<Source type>.

After the data has been read the user can apply different input filters (See L<Input filters>).

If the first column of a table is an auto-increment column, the C<INSERT INTO> statement is build without this first
column. This feature is available if supported by the database plugin.

=head3 Update

Update records. The affected (and not yet updated) records are shown shown before the user confirms the update.

See also I<Subqueries> in L</Extensions>

=head3 Delete

Delete records. The affected records are shown before the user confirms the deletion.

=head2 Data Input

=head3 Data source

=over

=item Plain

Insert the data cell by cell.

=item From File

The data is read from a chosen file.

Supported file formats: text files and file formats supported by L<Spreadsheet::Read>. C<Spreadsheet::Read> uses
different parser modules for the different file formats - see L<Spreadsheet::Read/SEE-ALSO>. The parser modules are
not installed automatically. It is up to the user to install the required parser modules.

Selecting I<From File> opens the I<Source directory> sub-menu where one can choose the directory which should be
searched for files.

If the L<Directory history> is set to C<1>, the I<Source directory> sub-menu is skipped and the directory is chosen
automatically.

After a directory has been chosen a sub-menu is opened where one can choose the source file.

If the previous sub-menu I<Source directory> is not shown due to the settings described before, it is possible to
change the source directory in this sub-menu by selecting I<Change dir>.

=back

=head3 Input filters

=over

=item Choose Cols

Use only selected columns of the imported data.

If the data has empty columns (C<-->), the non-empty columns are preselected. Columns are regarded as
empty if the values of all fields in the column - including the column header - have no length.

Columns added with the filter I<Append Col> are empty and therefore not preselected.

If a column is not empty, but has no header name the header is named temporarily C<tmp>.

=item Choose Rows

Use only selected rows of the imported data.

If the data has empty rows, the non-empty rows are preselected. Rows are regarded as empty if the values of all fields
in the row have no length.

=item Range Rows

Use only a range of rows.

=item Row Groups

If the input has rows with different numbers of columns, I<Row Groups> sorts rows with the same number of columns in a
group. The user can then choose one or more groups of rows. There is only one group, if all rows have the same column
count.

=item Remove Cell

Remove a cell from a chosen row.

=item Insert Cell

Insert a cell in a chosen row. The new cell is inserted in front of a chosen cell.

=item Append Col

Append an empty column. Appends a header element to the header row and adjusts the remaining rows to the length of the
header row. If the input has rows with different numbers of cells, use the I<Row Group> filter first to select the right
row-group.

=item Split Column

In the replacement it can be used the variable C<$c> as a counter. C<$c> is set to C<0> before each C<s///>.

Available modifiers: C<g>, C<i>, C<e>.

By selecting the prompt line (C<Your choice:>) one can save I<search & replace>-instructions for later use.

If a I<search & replace> has altered the first row of the input data, a menu entry named C<RESTORE header row> is
offered.

I<Join Columns> can be used to edit a column by selecting only one column.

=item Fill up Rows

If the input table rows have different numbers of cells, this filter appends empty cells to the rows until the cell
count of the rows are equal to the cell count of the row with highest cell count.

One can enter in the I<Row Group> filter to see if the table has rows with different length. If I<Row Group> shows only
one group, all rows have the same length.

=item Cols to Rows

Transpose columns to rows.

     Year | 2000 | 2001 | 2002              Year | Max | Min

=back

C<SQLite>:

- database names in SQL statements (C<ATTACH DATABASE>) are always quoted.

- if the current database has attached databases, the use of qualified table names is enabled automatically.

=head3 View prefix

Enter a string which should be automatically put in front of all view names.

=head3 Auto increment

Setting I<Auto increment> to a value which is not the empty string enables the option to set an auto increment column
when creating a table. The value set here is then used as the default name for the auto increment column.

=head3 Col data types

If this option is enabled and a table is created, C<SQL::Type::Guess> is used to detect the data types. These data types
are then used as default values when the user is asked for the data types.

=head2 Output

=head3 Truncate column threshold

Columns with a width below or equal I<Trunc col threshold> are only trimmed if it is still required to lower the row
width despite all columns wider than I<Trunc col threshold> have been trimmed to I<Trunc col threshold>.

=head3 Truncate fractions first

If the terminal width is not wide enough and I<Trunc fract first> is enabled, the first step to reduce the width of the
columns is to truncate the fraction part of numbers to 2 decimal places.

=head3 Progress bar

Set the progress bar threshold. If the number of fields (rows x columns) is higher than the threshold, a progress bar is
shown while preparing the data for the output.

=head3 Tab width

Set the number of spaces between columns.

=head3 Color

Enables the support for color and text formatting escape sequences (SGR) if set to C<Enable>. Before the output it is
added a reset (C<\e[0m>) at the end of each row.

=head3 Binary filter

Set I<Binary filter> to C<NO>, C<BNRY> or C<Hexadecimal>.

C<NO> - print the binary data as it is

C<BNRY> - "BNRY" is printed instead of the binary data

C<Hexadecimal> - the binary data is printed in hexadecimal format

If the first 100 characters of the data match the repexp C</[\x00-\x08\x0B-\x0C\x0E-\x1F]/>, the data is considered
arbitrary binary data.

Printing unfiltered arbitrary binary data could break the output.

=head3 Squash spaces

If I<squash_spaces> is enabled, consecutive spaces are squashed to one space and leading and trailing spaces are removed.

=head3 Indentation

Set the indentation width for the SQL substatements.

=head3 Undef string

Set the string that will be shown on the screen instead of an undefined field.

On C<MSWin32> only single-byte character sets are supported when entering the setting I<Undef string>, I<user>, I<host>
or I<port> with the C<db-browser>s readline. But it is possible to edit the entry in configuration files directly after
the entry was created with this options menu.

=head3 Warnings

If the row length is greater than the screen width, make notes of the number of columns and the length of each column
before using I<Template>.

=item

Choose the input record separator.

=item

Set the number of columns (I<Col count>) and the width of the column separator (I<Sep width>). I<Col count> expects an
integer of 1 or greater; I<Sep width> expects an integer of 0 or greater.

=item

Set the widths of the columns (1 or greater). For the last column one can also enter an asterisk (C<*>). The last
column with an asterisk means: Use the remaining part of the row for the last column.

=item

Decide whether leading spaces should be removed. Trailing whitespaces are removed automatically.

=back

Advantages:

=item

Good for fixed column length inputs containing only single width characters.

Spreadsheet::Read

If C<Spreadsheet::Read> is chosen, the default settings from L<Spreadsheet::Read> are used.

C<Spreadsheet::Read> will use the first line of the file to auto-detect the separation character if the file is a
csv-file.

C<Spreadsheet::Read::rows> fills up uneven rows automatically so the filter L<Fill up Rows> and L<Row Groups> have no
meaning if C<Spreadsheet::Read> is used.

Advantages:

=over

=item

Auto-detects the separation character for csv-files

=head3 CSV options in a

Set C<sep_char>, C<quote_char>, C<escape_char>, C<eol> and C<comment_str>.

If entered nothing, default values are used.

For the meaning of the different options see L<Text::CSV_XS>.

=head3 CSV options in b

Set C<allow_loose_escapes>, C<allow_loose_quotes>, C<allow_whitespace>, C<blank_is_undef>, C<binary>, C<decode_utf8>,
C<empty_is_undef> and C<skip_empty_rows>.

For the meaning of the different options see L<Text::CSV_XS>.

=item

Record separator

Set the input record separator (regexp).

=item

Trim record left

Expects a regex pattern. If set, removes leading characters matching regexp from each record.

=item

Trim record right

Expects a regex pattern. If set, removes trailing characters matching regexp from each record.

=item

Field separator

Set the input field separator (regexp).

=item

Trim field left

Expects a regex pattern. If set, removes leading characters matching regexp from each field.

=item

Trim field right

=head3 Input filter

Enable the input filter menu.

Enabling I<input filter> will cause a second copy of the data to be kept in memory.

=head3 Empty to Null

Set the I<empty_to_null> defaults for the different data source types.

=head3 File encoding in

How to decode text files.

=head3 Directory history

Set how many searched directories should be saved in the directory history.

A value of C<0> disables the history.

If I<Directory history> is set to C<1> and a directory has been saved, the directory is chosen automatically without
showing the history menu.

=head3 File filter

This option expects as its value a string. The string is used as a glob pattern.

If I<file> is selected as the data source type, only files matching this glob pattern are part of the available files.

=head3 Hidden files

If I<file> is selected as the data source type, this setting determines if hidden files are part of the available files
or not.

=head3 Source type

Set the data source type to C<plain>, C<file> or C<menu> for C<Insert Into> and for C<Create Table>.

If this option is set to C<menu>, a menu is offered where the user can choose the type of the data source. If this
option is set to C<plain> or C<file>, the respective setting is used directly without any menu.

=head2 Export_

=head3 Destination folder

Set the folder where the data to be exported will be saved as a CSV file.

=head3 File name

=over

=item File extension csv

If this option is enabled, the file extension C<csv> is added automatically to the file-name.

=item Default file name

If enabled, the table name will be used as the default name for the exported file.

=back

=head3 CSV options out a

Set C<sep_char>, C<quote_char>, C<escape_char>, C<eol> and C<undef_str>.

If entered nothing, default values are used except for C<eol> which is then set to C<$/> (input record separator).

For the meaning of the different options see L<Text::CSV_XS>.

=head3 CSV options out b

Set C<always_quote>, C<binary>, C<escape_null>, C<quote_binary>, C<quote_empty> and C<quote_space>.

For the meaning of the different options see L<Text::CSV_XS>.

=head3 File encoding out

The encoding of the exported CSV file.

=head2 Misc

Set the behavior of

=head3 Menu memory

If enabled: saves the menu position while entering in a sub menu.

=head3 Expand table

Expand table rows:

=over

=item C<YES>

if C<Return> is pressed, the selected table row is printed with each column in its own line. The first row is not
expanded if the cursor auto-jumped to the first row.

=item C<NO>

don't expand table rows.

=back

=head3 Search

Set the search behavior (C<Ctrl-F>).

=over

=item C<disabled>

=item C<case-insensitive search>

=item C<case-sensitive search>

=back

=head3 Mouse mode

Set the I<Mouse mode> (see L<Term::Choose/mouse>).

=head3 DB2 encoding

C<DB2> databases only: set the application code set.

Data comming from a DB2 database is decoded with this encoding.

=head1 CONFIGURATION FILES

To find out the location of the configuration files call C<db-browser -h> and choose I<Path>. The data is saved in JSON
format.

=head1 REQUIREMENTS

=head2 Perl version

Requires Perl version 5.14.0 or greater.

=head2 Decoded strings

C<db-browser> expects decoded strings.

Non mappable characters will break the output.

=head2 Terminal

It is required a terminal that uses a monospaced font which supports the printed characters.

The terminal has to understand ANSI escape sequences. If the OS is MSWin32 C<App::DBBrowser> uses
L<Win32::Console::ANSI> which emulates an ANSI console for the C<db-browser>.

=head2 Permissions

To be able to browse the database-, schema- and table-lists and the content of tables the user must have the database
privileges required for fetching the requested data.

The C<db-browser> expects an existing home directory with read and write permissions for the user of the C<db-browser>.
