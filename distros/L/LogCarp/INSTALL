To install the CGI::LogCarp module for Perl 5, proceed as follows:

1. Unpack the source archive into a suitable directory with

	gunzip -cf LogCarp-x.xx.tar.gz | tar xvf -

2. Go into the newly created directory with

	cd LogCarp-x.xx

3. Build the module as usual :

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install

See the file 'README' for general notes on CGI::LogCarp.

See the file 'Changes' for change notes on CGI::LogCarp.

Note: The tests currently fail when testing croak, die, and confess for
obvious reasons. Don't worry too much about that. In the ./t directory,
there will be the output of redirected error, log, and debug streams.
You can check what you get against my versions in the ./t/check directory.
