  examples/KP.pl
   Fix superfluous hyphen when splitting at an existing hyphen. It is not clear
    whether this is the best practice, or that it would be better to handle
    this "upstream" in KnuthPlass.pm. Also, other hyphens and dashes do not
    seem to be well handled.

  META.yml, README.md
   Clean up support-related email addresses and pages.

  README.md  remove example code (is still found in examples/KP.pl) to 
    shorten this file to a reasonable length.

  META.yml
   Add repository (GitHub) and bugtracker (GitHub) entries. Want to cut over
    to GitHub because RT ticket system is going away in March.

  t/02-javascript.t
   Got another floating point failure (long double or quadmath), so went 
    ahead and rounded the rest of the floating point constants in that test.

2020-12-10  1.04  (Phil M Perry)

  Makefile.PL removed, Build.PL, META.yml, MANIFEST, README.md
   Revert to use of Build.PL.

2020-12-09  1.03  (Phil M Perry)

  Makefile.PL, Build.PL, MANIFEST
   Change build process to use Makefile.PL instead of Build.PL

  t/02-javascript.t
   Fix failing t-tests due to use of long-double or quadmath libraries (more
    precision than the t-test was providing). There are still many failures
    of this test on every Solaris box, but at the moment I have no way to
    try to debug on that platform (I will be looking for volunteers to help
    out with this).

  lib/Text/KnuthPlass.xs
   Fix failing Windows t-tests where libraries already contained an _unlink
    module (rename to _unlinkKP).

  Build.PL, README.md, MANIFEST
   Change authorship statement, write a much more complete README 
    (with markdown).

  t/00-load.t, t/02-javascript.t, t/pod-coverage.t, t/pod.t, 
    lib/Text/KnuthPlass.pm
   Fix Perl Critic complaints. Currently ignoring "multiple package 
    declarations" in KnuthPlass.pm, might in the future split up the file.
    Move pod and pod-coverage to "author testing only".

  tools/1_pc.pl, tools/2_t-tests.pl, tools/3_examples.pl, MANIFEST,
    examples/KP.pl
   Add some tools for testing and illustrating usage.
