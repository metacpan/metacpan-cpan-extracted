 Lingua::PT::Speaker  
---------------------

  Text-to-Speech module for the portuguese language.

  To run it you need to fulfill the module dependencies (as expected)
  but also:

  - an mbrola player. You can find an executable for your operating
    system in the mbrola webpage. At the moment we expect you to have
    in the your system PATH, and called just 'mbrola'.

  - the mbrola phonemes library for the Portuguese language. It can be
    downloaded also from the mbrola website. Put it somewhere as
    /usr/lib/mbrola/pt1. The module checks for some reasonable
    locations, but not all possible.

  - an .wav command line player. We check for 'play', 'sndplay',
    'esdplay' and 'rawplay' in this order. Please check you have one
    of those in your path.
