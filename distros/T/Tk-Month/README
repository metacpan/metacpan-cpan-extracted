HOW TO BUILD AND INSTALL
perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install

TESTING
As this is a Tk GUI module it is hard to test non-interactively.
Try
	perl lib/Tk/Month.pm
	perl lib/Tk/Year.pm
	perl lib/Tk/StrfClock.pm
	perl lib/Tk/Panel.pm
	perl t/demo

There is a built-in test procedure which is run if and only if
the module itself is run. In the case of Month.pm and StrfClock.pm
the built-in is actually useful.

You can also pass widget flags from the command line:
	./lib/Tk/Year.pm -fg grey -bg darkblue -font fixed

There is also a demonstration in './t/demo'. Run after doing a make.

TODO
Nothing planned.
