   "synopsis" : "Poker Run - Live to Ride, Ride to DIE! Robert and Allan are two upstanding lawyers, suburbanites, husbands caught in the grip of boring normalcy that sometimes plagues us all - the wife, the house, the cars, the debt. A quiet desperation that often finds its own unique outlet in the form of the motorcycle; an ultimate expression of freedom now consigned to weekend outings straddled by flocks of rich urban bikers living out Easy Rider fantasies. However Robert and Allan's biker fantasies soon come crashing headlong into the brutal realities of biker life when they find themselves in the hands of two psychopaths on wheels, Ray and Billy. In the middle of a Poker Run, a desert bike rally between Victorville and Vegas, Ray and Billy abduct Robert and Allan's wives and leave the two men with an ultimatum of death if they ever hope to see the women alive again. Now they must follow a bizarre set of clues that include several horrifying tasks that will leave the sweltering Mojave desert deafened by the roar of motorcycles and awash in blood!",
