NAME
    Graph::Algorithm::HITS - Anothor HITS algorithm implementation loading
    Graph

SYNOPSIS
      use Graph::Algorithm::HITS;
      use Graph;
      my $g = new Graph();
      $g->add_vertices(...);
      $g->add_edges(...);
      # Graph object as input
      my $hits = Graph::Algorithm::HITS(graph => $g);
      $hits->iterate(20); 
      # $auth_vector = { v1 => $auth_score_v1, v2 => $auth_score_v2,,, }
      my $auth_vector = $hits->get_authority();
      # $hub_vector = { $v1 => $hub_score_v1, v2 => $hub_score_v2,,, }
      my $hub_vector = $hits->get_hub();

DESCRIPTION
    Graph::Algorithm::HITS implements HITS algorithm (see
    <http://www2002.org/CDROM/refereed/643/node1.html>). There are a couple
    of HITS algorithm implementations in CPAN though, the reason you would
    choose this is that the score can be calculated by simply loading from
    Graph object.
