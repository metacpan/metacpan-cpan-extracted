NAME
    Lingua::Alphabet::Phonetic::LAPD - map ABC's to the LAPD phonetic letter
    names

VERSION
    version 0.02

SYNOPSIS
     use Lingua::Alphabet::Phonetic;
     my $phonetic = Lingua::Alphabet::Phonetic('LAPD');
     # prints One-Adam-OneTwo
     print $phonetic->enunciate("1-A-12");

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides for Lingua::Alphabet::Phonetic the LAPD phonetic
    alphabet used by the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) and other
    local state law enforcement agencies across the state of California.

    This is a specialization of Lingua::Alphabet::Phonetic. You do not use
    this module directly. All interaction should be through an
    Lingua::Alphabet::Phonetic.

INSPIRATION
    I wrote this module along with a number of other back ends for L::A::P
    years ago for a gimmick on my website. Recently I was watching Adam-12
    on Netflix and decided this was a sign that this module should be
    shared.

    Unfortunately 1-A-12 comes back as 1-Adam-OneTwo instead of
    1-Adam-Twelve.
