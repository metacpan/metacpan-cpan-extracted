NAME
    File::ShareDir::Tarball - Deal transparently with shared files
    distributed as tarballs

VERSION
    version 0.2.2

SYNOPSIS
        use File::ShareDir::Tarball ':all';

        # use exactly like File::ShareDir
        $dir = dist_dir('File-ShareDir');

DESCRIPTION
    If the shared files of a distribution are contained in a tarball (see
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::ShareDir::Tarball for why you would want to do
    that), automatically extract the archive in a temporary directory and
    return the path to that directory. If called for a regular distribution
    without a bundle file ("shared-files.tar.gz"), it'll return the original
    shared dir. In other words, from the consumer point of view, it'll
    behave just like File::ShareDir.

EXPORT TAGS
  :all
    Exports "dist_dir()" and "dist_file()".

EXPORTABLE FUNCTIONS
  dist_dir( $distribution )
    Behaves just like "dist_dir()" from File::ShareDir.

  dist_file( $distribution, $file )
    Behaves just like "dist_file()" from File::ShareDir.

SEE ALSO
    Test::File::ShareDir
        To test or use a shared dir that is not deployed yet.

    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::ShareDir::Tarball
        Dist::Zilla plugin to create the tarball effortlessly.

    Module::Build::CleanInstall
        Provides an alternative to this module by subclassing Module::Build
        and, upon installation, remove the files from previous installations
        as given in the *packlist*.
