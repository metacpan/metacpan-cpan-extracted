- Chart::PNGgraph version 1.21
- Minor fix of a bug in sample11.pl

Thu April 4 2000 by sbonds@agora.rdrop.com
- Chart::PNGgraph version 1.20
- Major revision from Martien Verbruggen to use GD::Graph instead of
  linking directly with GD.  This is intended for backward compatibility
  only-- you are encouraged to use GD::Graph instead of Chart::PNGgraph as 
  there will not be any more features added to Chart::PNGgraph

Mon January 3 2000 by sbonds@agora.rdrop.com
- Chart::PNGgraph version 1.15
- minor bugfix-- 'make test' would fail due to a missing file

Mon December 20 1999 by sbonds@agora.rdrop.com
- Chart::PNGgraph version 1.14
- Bugfixes only-- better TrueType support coming soon
- Fix divide-by-zero error when all data points are zero
- Clarify documentation on how to use plot(\@data) method

Thu October 21 1999 by sbonds@agora.rdrop.com
- Chart::PNGgraph version 1.13
- Added primitive support for TrueType fonts
- Fixed bug where 3d charts with very large slices would not have both
  parts of the front filled properly.

Thu October 7 1999  by sbonds@agora.rdrop.com
- Chart::PNGgraph version 1.12
- Changed namespace to Chart:PNGgraph so that CPAN will index it properly
- Added "base" tests-- still very incomplete
- Changed sample 5-2 to have multiple lines since this is what the html
  file described it as having.
- Checks the read-only attributes 'pngx' and 'pngy' so these will not get
  accidently set.  $g->set() returns undef if they are present, but the
  rest of the attributes will be set.

Tue August 31 1999  by sbonds@agora.rdrop.com
- Please contact me rather than the original author for problems unless
  you are convinced that the problems are not a result of the port to PNG
- Converted GIFgraph-1.10 to PNGgraph-1.10 so it works properly with GD-1.20
- UNISYS has been increasingly defensive of the LZW patent used in GIF
  compression, which necessitates these kinds of fixes.

  it.
