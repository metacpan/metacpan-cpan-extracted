DESCRIPTION

    POE::Component::Client::DNS::Recursive is a POE component that
    implements a recursive DNS client.

    POE sessions and components can spawn a
    POE::Component::Client::DNS::Recursive instance to perform a DNS query.
    The component will perform its task and return the results to the
    requesting session.

    One may also enable tracing of the delegation path from the root name
    servers for the name being looked up.

CONSTRUCTOR

    resolve

      Takes a number of options, only those marked as mandatory are
      required:

        'event', the event to emit when completed, mandatory;
        'host', what to look up, mandatory;
        'type', defaults to 'A' or 'PTR' if 'host' appears to be an IP address;
        'class', defaults to 'IN';
        'port', the port to use for DNS requests. Default is 53;
        'session', provide an alternative session to send the resultant event to;
        'trace', the event to send trace information to;
        'nameservers', an arrayref of IP addresses that the poco will use instead of built-in 'hints';
        'context', user defined data. Can be anything that can be stored in a scalar;

      event and trace are discussed in the OUTPUT EVENTS section below.

      event and trace may also be POE::Session postbacks.

      session is only required if one wishes to send the resultant events
      to a different session than the calling one, or if the component is
      spawned with the POE::Kernel as its parent.

OUTPUT EVENTS

    The output events from the component as specified in the resolve
    constructor.

    If you have opted to use postbacks, then these parameters will be
    passed in the arrayref in ARG1.

    event

      Emitted when the query has finished.

      ARG0 will contain a hashref with the following fields:

        host     => the host requested,
        type     => the type requested,
        class    => the class requested,
        context  => the context that was passed to us,
        response => a Net::DNS::Packet object,
        error    => an error message ( if applicable )

      response contains a Net::DNS::Packet object on success or undef if
      the lookup failed. The Net::DNS::Packet object describes the response
      to the program's request. It may contain several DNS records. Please
      consult Net::DNS and Net::DNS::Packet for more information.

      error contains a description of any error that has occurred. It is
      only valid if response is undefined.

    trace

      Emitted whenever an element of the delegation path from the root
      servers is found.

      ARG0 will be a Net::DNS::Packet object.
