DESCRIPTION
    The Logfile extension will help you to generate various reports from
    different server logfiles. In general there is no restriction as to what
    information you extract from the logfiles.

  Reading the files
    The package can be customized by subclassing "Logfile".

    A subclass should provide a function "next" which reads the next record
    from the file handle "$self->{Fh}" and returns an object of type
    "Logfile::Record". In addition a function "norm" may be specified to
    normalize the various record fields.

    Here is a shortened version of the "Logfile::Cern" class:

      package Logfile::Cern;
      @ISA = qw ( Logfile::Base ) ;

      sub next {
          my $self = shift;
          my $fh = $self->{Fh};

          *S = $fh;
          my ($line,$host,$user,$pass,$rest,$date,$req,$code,$bytes);

          ($host,$user,$pass,$rest) = split ' ', $line, 4;
          ($rest =~ s!\[([^\]]+)\]\s*!!) && ($date = $1);
          ($rest =~ s!\"([^\"]+)\"\s*!!) && ($req = (split ' ', $1)[1]);
          ($code, $bytes) = split ' ', $rest;
          Logfile::Record->new(Host  => $host,
                               Date  => $date,
                               File  => $req,
                               Bytes => $bytes);
      }

    As stated above, in general you are free to choose the fields you enter
    in the record. But:

    Date should be a valid date string. For conversion to the seconds
         elapsed since the start of epoch the modules GetDate and
         Date::DateParse are tried. If both cannot be "use"ed, a crude
         build-in module is used.

         The record constructor replaces Date by the date in "yymmdd" form
         to make it sortable. Also the field Hour is padded in.

    Host Setting Host will also set field Domain by the verbose name of the
         country given by the domain suffix of the fully qualified domain
         name (hostname.domain). "foo.bar.PG" will be mapped to "Papua New".
         Host names containing no dot will be assigned to the domain Local.
         IP numbers will be assigned to the domain Unresolved. Mapping of
         short to long domain names is done in the Net::Country extension
         which might be useful in other contexts:

           use Net::Country;
           $germany = Net::Country::Name('de');

    Records
         is always set to 1 in the "Record" constructor. So this field gives
         the number of successful returns from the "next" function.

    Here is the shortened optional "norm" method:

      sub norm {
          my ($self, $key, $val) = @_;

          if ($key eq File) {
              $val =~ s/\?.*//;                             # remove query
              $val =~ s!%([\da-f][\da-f])!chr(hex($1))!eig; # decode escapes
          }
          $val;
      }

    The constructor reads in a logfile and builds one or more indices.

      $l = new Logfile::Cern  File => 'cache.log.gz', 
                              Group => [Host,Domain,File,Hour,Date];

    There is little space but some time overhead in generating additional
    indexes. If the File parameter is not given, STDIN is used. The Group
    parameter may be a field name or a reference to a list of field names.
    Only the field names given as constructor argument can be used for
    report generation.

  Report Generation
    The Index to use for a report must be given as the Group parameter.
    Output is sorted by the index field unless a Sort parameter is given.
    Also the output can be truncated by a Top argument or Limit.

    The report generator lists the fields Bytes and Records for a given
    index. The option List may be a single field name or a reference to an
    array of field names. It specifies which field should be listed in
    addition to the Group field. List defaults to Records.

      $l->report(Group => Domain, List => [Bytes, Records])

    Output is sorted by the Group field unless overwritten by a Sort option.
    Default sorting order is increasing for Date and Hour fields and
    decreasing for all other Fields. The order can be reversed using the
    Reverse option.

    This code

      $l->report(Group => File, Sort => Records, Top => 10);

    prints:

  Report options
    Group "=>" *field*
         Mandatory. *field* must be one of the fields passed to the
         constructor.

    List "=>" *field*
    List "=>" [*field*, *field*]
         List the subtotals for *field*s. Defaults to Records.

    Sort "=>" *field*.
         Sort output by *field*. By default, Date and Hour are sorted in
         increasing order, whereas all other fields are sorted in decreasing
         order.

    Reverse "=> 1"
         Reverse sorting order.

    Top "=>" *number*
         Print only the first *number* subtotals.

    Limit "=>" *number*
         Print only the subtotals with Sort field greater than *number*
         (less than number if sorted in increasing order).

    Currently reports are simply printed to STDOUT.

NEWS
    Fixed strict refs bug for perl 5.005.

    Fixed bug in fallback to included date parsing reported by James Downs.

    Fixed y2k bug as suggested by Fred Korz. I chose the two digit version
    to be a backward compatible as possible. The 20 will be obvious a few
    years from now ;-) Output columns should now be separated by whitespace
    in any case.
