NAME
    Dist::Zilla::Stash::Store::Git - A common place to store and interface
    with git

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.000005 of
    Dist::Zilla::Stash::Store::Git - released May 14, 2014 as part of
    Dist-Zilla-Stash-Store-Git.

SYNOPSIS
DESCRIPTION
    This is a Dist::Zilla Store providing a common place to store, fetch and
    share configuration information as to your distribution's git
    repository, as well as your own preferences (e.g. git tag versioning
    scheme).

ATTRIBUTES
  dynamic_config
    This attribute contains all the configuration information provided to
    the store by the plugins performing the
    Dist::Zilla::Role::GitStore::ConfigProvider. Any values specified herein
    override those in the "default_config", and anything set by the store
    configuration (aka "store_config") similarly overrides anything here.

  store_config
    This attribute contains all the information passed to the store via the
    store's configuration, e.g. in the distribution's "dist.ini". Any values
    specified herein override those in the "default_config", and anything
    returned by a plugin (aka "dynamic_config") similarly overrides anything
    here.

    This is a read-only accessor to the "store_config" attribute.

  config
    This attribute contains a HashRef of all the known configuration values,
    from all sources (default, stash and plugins aka dynamic). It merges the
    "dynamic_config" into "store_config", and that result into
    "default_config", each time giving the hash being merged precedence.

    If you're looking for "The Right Place to Find Configuration Values",
    this is it. :)

  repo_wrapper
    Contains a lazily-constructed Git::Wrapper instance for our repository.

  repo_raw
    Contains a lazily-constructed Git::Raw::Repository instance for our
    repository.

  repo_root
    Stores the repository root; by default this is the current directory.

  tags
    An ArrayRef of all existing tags in the repository.

  previous_versions
    A sorted ArrayRef of all previous versions of this distribution, as
    derived from the repository tags filtered through the regular expression
    given in the "version.regexp".

METHODS
  stash_from_config()
    This method wraps "stash_from_config" in Dist::Zilla::Role::Stash to
    capture our Dist::Zilla instance and funnel all our stash configuration
    options into the "store_config" attribute.

  default_config
    This method provides a HashRef of all the default settings we know
    about. At the moment, this is:

        version.regexp => '^v(.+)$'
        version.first  => '0.001'

    You should never need to mess with this -- note that "store_config"
    (values passed to the store via configuration) and "dynamic_config"
    (values returned by the plugins performing the
    Dist::Zilla::Role::GitStore::ConfigProvider), respectively, override
    this.

  dynamic_config
    This is a read-only accessor to the "dynamic_config" attribute.

  has_dynamic_config
    True if we have been provided any configuration by plugins.

    This is a read-only accessor to the "dynamic_config" attribute.

  has_dynamic_config_for
    True if plugin configuration has been provided for a given key, e.g.

        do { ... } if $store->has_dynamic_config_for('version.first');

    This is a read-only accessor to the "dynamic_config" attribute.

  store_config
    A read-only accessor to the store_config attribute.

    This is a read-only accessor to the "store_config" attribute.

  has_store_config
    True if we have been provided any static configuration.

    This is a read-only accessor to the "store_config" attribute.

  has_store_config_for
    True if static configuration has been provided for a given key, e.g.

        do { ... } if $store->has_store_config_for('version.first');

    This is a read-only accessor to the "store_config" attribute.

  config()
    A read-only accessor returning the config HashRef.

    This is a read-only accessor to the "config" attribute.

  has_config
    True if we have any configuration stored; false if not.

    This is a read-only accessor to the "config" attribute.

  has_no_config
    The inverse of "has_config".

    This is a read-only accessor to the "config" attribute.

  has_config_for($key)
    Returns true if we have configuration information for a given key.

    This is a read-only accessor to the "config" attribute.

  get_config_for($key)
    Returns the value we have for a given key; returns "undef" if we have no
    configuration information for that key.

    This is a read-only accessor to the "config" attribute.

  repo_wrapper()
    This is a read-only accessor to the "repo_wrapper" attribute.

  repo_raw()
    This is a read-only accessor to the "repo_raw" attribute.

  repo_root
    Returns the path to the repository root; this may be a relative path.

    This is a read-only accessor to the "repo_root" attribute.

  tags()
    A read-only accessor to the "tags" attribute.

  previous_versions()
    A read-only accessor to the "previous_versions" attribute.

  has_previous_versions
    True if this distribution has any previous versions; that is, if any git
    tags match the version regular expression.

    This is a read-only accessor to the "previous_versions" attribute.

  earliest_version
    Returns the earliest version known; "undef" if no such version exists.

    This is a read-only accessor to the "previous_versions" attribute.

  latest_version
    Returns the latest version known; "undef" if no such version exists.

    This is a read-only accessor to the "previous_versions" attribute.

ATCHUNG!
    This is VERY EARLY CODE UNDER ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT! It's being used by
    this author's plugin bundle, and as such is being released as a
    non-TRIAL / non-development (e.g. x.xxx_01) release to make that easier.
    The interface is likely to change. Stability (as it is) should be
    expected when this section is removed and the version = 0.001 (aka
    0.001000).

    Contributions, issues and the like are welcome and encouraged.
