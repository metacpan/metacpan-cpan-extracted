NAME
    Web::Solid::Test - Solid Test Scripts

VERSION
    Version 0.021

SYNOPSIS
      use Test::FITesque::RDF;
      my $suite = Test::FITesque::RDF->new(source => $file, base_uri => $ENV{SOLID_REMOTE_BASE})->suite;
      $suite->run_tests;
      done_testing;

    See `tests/basic.t` for a full example.

DESCRIPTION
    The basic idea with these tests is to simplify reuse and formulation of
    fixture tables using the Resource Description Framework (RDF). It is in an
    early stage, but there are running tests in this module.

    This system is built on Test::FITesque::RDF, which adds RDF fixture tables
    to Test::FITesque.

    Then, the idea is that modules such as this will provide a reusable
    implementation of certain tests, and that they can be adapted to concrete
    test scenarios by either passing parameters from the RDF tables (for both
    input variables and expected outcomes), or using environment variables.

    To run the actual tests, test scripts will be made, but they should be
    terse as their only mission is to initialize the test framework, see the
    synopsis for an example of such a script. The script can then be invoked
    by e.g. CI systems or used in development.

    The RDF fixture tables and the small wrapper scripts can exist
    independently of the module, and modules can be installed easily so that
    they can be reused. Nevertheless, it is also natural to package these
    together, like it has been done in this package.

TEST MODULES
    The tests will live in test modules, currently, this distribution contains

    *   Web::Solid::Test::Basic

    *   Web::Solid::Test::HTTPLists

    Within these, there are test scripts in the form of subroutines containing
    subtests. These are then referenced from the fixture tables.
