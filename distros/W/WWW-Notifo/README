DESCRIPTION
    Notifo (<http://notifo.com/>) is a web based notification service that
    can send push messages to mobile deviceas.

    From <http://notifo.com/>:

      What Can I Do With Notifo?

      If you are a User, you can subscribe to receive notifications from
      your favorite services that integrate with Notifo. On Notifo's site
      you can set timers, send yourself messages, set stock alerts, and
      Google Voice SMS alerts. More built-in services will be released in
      the near future.

      If you are a Service, you can integrate with Notifo's API and start
      sending mobile notifications to your users within a few hours. No need
      to spend time or resources developing mobile applications just so you
      can reach your users!

  "new"
    Create a new "WWW::Notifo" object. In common with all methods exposed by
    the module accepts a number of key => value pairs. The "username" and
    "secret" options are mandatory:

      my $notifo = WWW::Notifo->new(
        username => 'alice',
        secret   => 'x3122b4c4d3bad5e8d7397f0501b617ce60afe5d'
      );

  API Calls
    API calls provide access to the Notifo API.

    On success they return a reference to a hash containing the response
    from notifo.com. On errors an exception will be thrown. In the case of
    an error the response hash can be retrieved by calling "last".

   "subscribe_user"
    Service providers must call this method when users want to subscribe to
    notifo alerts. This method will send a confirmation message to the user
    where they can complete the opt-in process. The service provider will
    not be able to send notifications to the user until this subscribe/opt-
    in process has been completed.

    Users sending notifications to themselves with their User account do not
    need to use this method. Since a User account can only send
    notifications to itself, it is already implicitly subscribed. Only
    Service accounts need to use this method to subscribe other users.

      my $resp = $notifo->subscribe_user(
        username => 'hexten'
      );

   "send_notification"
    Once a user has subscribed to notifo alerts, service providers can call
    this method to send notifications to specific users. The "to" and "msg"
    parameters are required. The "title" parameter is optional, and can be
    thought of as a description of the type of notification being sent
    (almost like the subject of an email). The "uri" parameter is used to
    specify what URI (web address, app uri, etc) will be loaded when the
    user opens the notification. If omitted, the default service provider
    URL is used.

      my $resp = $notifo->send_notification(
        to    => 'hexten',
        msg   => 'Testing...',
        label => 'Test',
        title => 'Hoot',
        uri   => 'http://hexten.net/'
      );

   "api"
    API entry points other than "subscribe_user" and "send_notification" (of
    which there are currently none) can be accessed directly by calling
    "api". For example, the above send_notification example can also be
    written as:

      my $resp = $notifo->api(
        'send_notification',
        to    => 'hexten',
        msg   => 'Testing...',
        label => 'Test',
        title => 'Hoot',
        uri   => 'http://hexten.net/'
      );

   "last"
    Get the most recent response (a hash ref). Useful in the case of an HTTP
    error (which throws an exception).

  Procedural Interface
    The following convenience subroutine may be exported:

   "notifo"
    Send a notification.

      notifo(
        username  => 'alice',
        secret    => 'x3122b4c4d3bad5e8d7397f0501b617ce60afe5d',
        to        => 'hexten',
        msg       => 'Testing...',
        label     => 'Test',
        title     => 'Hoot',
        uri       => 'http://hexten.net/'
      );
