Revision history for Perl extension NEXT.pm

0.67 2016-07-30 NEILB
    - Changed class names in SYNOPSIS from A, B, C, D to P, Q, R, S.
      This is avoid potential clash with core B:: namespace. RT#9734
      I didn't change the later examples in the doc, as I think they're ok.
    - Added mentions of next::method in the core "mro" module.
    - Changed all mentions of "NEXT.pm" in the doc to C<NEXT>.

0.66 2016-07-28 NEILB
    - split the "package EVERY" statement across two lines to hide it
      from PAUSE and help with resolving a permissions conflict with "Every".
    - Added prereqs, license type, and min perl version to dist metadata
    - Added github repo to dist metadata
    - Fixed pod error reported in RT#49984 and RT#100587,
      and rogue trailing spaces in pod, RT#64923

0.62    Wed Apr  8 03:27:25 2009
