        # run validate
        $input->validate or die $input->errors_to_string;

DESCRIPTION

    Validation::Class is a scalable data validation library with interfaces
    for applications of all sizes. The most common usage of
    Validation::Class is to transform class namespaces into data validation
    domains where consistency and reuse are primary concerns.
    Validation::Class provides an extensible framework for defining
    reusable data validation rules. It ships with a complete set of
    pre-defined validations and filters referred to as "directives".

    The core feature-set consist of self-validating methods, validation
    profiles, reusable validation rules and templates, pre and post input
    filtering, class inheritance, automatic array handling, and
    extensibility (e.g. overriding default error messages, creating custom
    validators, creating custom input filters and much more).
    Validation::Class promotes DRY (don't repeat yourself) code. The main
    benefit in using Validation::Class is that the architecture is designed
    to increase the consistency of data input handling. The following is a
    more traditional usage of Validation::Class, using the DSL to construct
    a validator class:

        package MyApp::Person;
    
        use Validation::Class;
    
        # data validation template
        mixin basic     => {
            required    => 1,
            max_length  => 255,
            filters     => [qw/trim strip/]
        };
    
        # data validation rules for the username parameter
        field username  => {
            mixin       => 'basic',
            min_length  => 5
        };
    
        # data validation rules for the password parameter
        field password  => {
            mixin       => 'basic',
            min_length  => 5,
            min_symbols => 1
        };
    
        package main;
    
        my $person = MyApp::Person->new(username => 'admin', password => 'secr3t');
    
        # validate rules on the person object
        unless ($person->validates) {
            # handle the failures
            warn $person->errors_to_string;
        }
    
        1;

QUICKSTART

    If you are looking for a simple in-line data validation module built
    using the same tenets and principles as Validation::Class, please
    review Validation::Class::Simple or
    Validation::Class::Simple::Streamer. If you are new to
    Validation::Class, or would like more information on the underpinnings
    of this library and how it views and approaches data validation, please
    review Validation::Class::Whitepaper. Please review the "GUIDED-TOUR"
    in Validation::Class::Cookbook for a detailed step-by-step look into
    how Validation::Class works.

UPGRADE

    Validation::Class is stable, its feature-set is complete, and is
    currently in maintenance-only mode, i.e. Validation::Class will only be
    updated with minor enhancements and bug fixes. However, the lessons
    learned will be incorporated into a compelete rewrite uploaded under
    the namespace Validation::Interface. The Validation::Interface fork is
    designed to have a much simpler API with less options and better
    execution, focused on validating hierarchical data as its primarily
    objective.

    The adopt keyword (or adt) copies configuration and functionality from
    other Validation::Class classes. The adopt keyword takes three
    arguments, the name of the class to be introspected, and the
    configuration type and name to be recreated. Basically, anything you
    can configure using a Validation::Class keyword can be adopted into
    other classes using this keyword with the exception of coderefs
    registered using the build keyword. Please note! If you are adopting a
    field declaration which has an associated mixin directive defined on
    the target class, you must adopt the mixin explicitly if you wish it's
    values to be interpolated.

        package MyApp::Exployee;
    
        use Validate::Class;
        use MyApp::Person;
    
        adopt MyApp::Person, mixin   => 'basic';
        adopt MyApp::Person, field   => 'first_name';
        adopt MyApp::Person, field   => 'last_name';
        adopt MyApp::Person, profile => 'has_fullname';
    
        1;

    The attribute keyword (or has) registers a class attribute, i.e. it
    creates an accessor (getter and setter) on the class. Attribute
    declaration is flexible and only requires an attribute name to be
    configured. Additionally, the attribute keyword can takes two
    arguments, the attribute's name and a scalar or coderef to be used as
    it's default value.

        package MyApp::Person;
    
        use Validate::Class;
    
        attribute 'first_name' => 'Peter';
        attribute 'last_name'  => 'Venkman';
        attribute 'full_name'  => sub {
            join ', ', $_[0]->last_name, $_[0]->first_name
        };
    
        attribute 'email_address';
    
        1;

    The build keyword (or bld) registers a coderef to be run at
    instantiation much in the same way the common BUILD routine is used in
    modern OO frameworks.

        package MyApp::Person;
    
        use Validation::Class;
    
        build sub {
    
            my ($self, $args) = @_;
    
            # run after instantiation in the order defined
    
        };
    
        1;

    The build keyword takes one argument, a coderef which is passed the
    instantiated class object.

    The directive keyword (or dir) registers custom validator directives to
    be used in your field definitions. Please note that custom directives
    can only be used with field definitions. This is a means of extending
    the list of directives per instance. See the list of core directives,
    Validation::Class::Directives, or review Validation::Class::Directive
    for insight into creating your own CPAN installable directives.

        package MyApp::Person;
    
        use Validate::Class;
    
        # define a custom class-level directive
        directive 'blacklisted' => sub {
    
            my ($self, $field, $param) = @_;
    
            if (defined $field->{blacklisted} && defined $param) {
                if ($field->{required} || $param) {
                    if (exists_in_blacklist($field->{blacklisted}, $param)) {
                        my $handle = $field->label || $field->name;
                        $field->errors->add("$handle has been blacklisted");
                        return 0;
                    }
                }
            }
    
            return 1;
    
        };
    
        field 'email_address' => {
            blacklisted => '/path/to/blacklist'
            email => 1,
        };
    
        1;

    The directive keyword takes two arguments, the name of the directive
    and a coderef which will be used to validate the associated field. The
    coderef is passed four ordered parameters; a directive object, the
    class prototype object, the current field object, and the matching
    parameter's value. The validator (coderef) is evaluated by its return
    value as well as whether it altered any error containers.

    The document keyword (or doc) registers a data matching profile which
    can be used to validate heiarchal data. It will store a hashref with
    pre-define path matching rules for the data structures you wish to
    validate. The "path matching rules", which use a specialized object
    notation, referred to as the document notation, can be thought of as a
    kind-of simplified regular expression which is executed against the
    flattened data structure. The following are a few general use-cases:

        package MyApp::Person;
    
        use Validation::Class;
    
        field  'string' => {
            mixin => [':str']
        };
    
        # given this JSON data structure
        {
            "id": "1234-A",
            "name": {
                "first_name" : "Bob",
                "last_name"  : "Smith",
             },
            "title": "CIO",
            "friends" : [],
        }
    
        # select id to validate against the string rule
        document 'foobar'  =>
            { 'id' => 'string' };
    
        # select name -> first_name/last_name to validate against the string rule
        document 'foobar'  =>
            {'name.first_name' => 'string', 'name.last_name' => 'string'};
    
        # or
        document 'foobar'  =>
            {'name.*_name' => 'string'};
    
        # select each element in friends to validate against the string rule
        document 'foobar'  =>
            { 'friends.@'  => 'string' };
    
        # or select an element of a hashref in each element in friends to validate
        # against the string rule
        document 'foobar'  =>
            { 'friends.@.name' => 'string' };

    The document declaration's keys should follow the aforementioned
    document notation schema and it's values should be strings which
    correspond to the names of fields (or other document declarations) that
    will be used to preform the data validation. It is possible to combine
    document declarations to validate hierarchical data that contains data
    structures matching one or more document patterns. The following is an
    example of what that might look like.

        package MyApp::Person;
    
        use Validation::Class;
    
        # data validation rule
        field  'name' => {
            mixin      => [':str'],
            pattern    => qr/^[A-Za-z ]+$/,
            max_length => 20,
        };
    
        # data validation map / document notation schema
        document 'friend' => {
            'name' => 'name'
        };
    
        # data validation map / document notation schema
        document 'person' => {
            'name' => 'name',
            'friends.@' => 'friend'
        };
    
        package main;
    
        my $data = {
            "name"   => "Anita Campbell-Green",
            "friends" => [
                { "name" => "Horace" },
                { "name" => "Skinner" },
                { "name" => "Alonzo" },
                { "name" => "Frederick" },
            ],
        };
    
        my $person = MyApp::Person->new;
    
        unless ($person->validate_document(person => $data)) {
            warn $person->errors_to_string if $person->error_count;
        }
    
        1;

    Alternatively, the following is a more verbose data validation class
    using traditional styling and configuration.

        package MyApp::Person;
    
        use Validation::Class;
    
        field  'id' => {
            mixin      => [':str'],
            filters    => ['numeric'],
            max_length => 2,
        };
    
        field  'name' => {
            mixin      => [':str'],
            pattern    => qr/^[A-Za-z ]+$/,
            max_length => 20,
        };
    
        field  'rating' => {
            mixin      => [':str'],
            pattern    => qr/^\-?\d+$/,
        };
    
        field  'tag' => {
            mixin      => [':str'],
            pattern    => qr/^(?!evil)\w+/,
            max_length => 20,
        };
    
        document 'person' => {
            'id'                             => 'id',
            'name'                           => 'name',
            'company.name'                   => 'name',
            'company.supervisor.name'        => 'name',
            'company.supervisor.rating.@.*'  => 'rating',
            'company.tags.@'                 => 'name'
        };
    
        package main;
    
        my $data = {
            "id"      => "1234-ABC",
            "name"    => "Anita Campbell-Green",
            "title"   => "Designer",
            "company" => {
                "name"       => "House of de Vil",
                "supervisor" => {
                    "name"   => "Cruella de Vil",
                    "rating" => [
                        {   "support"  => -9,
                            "guidance" => -9
                        }
                    ]
                },
                "tags" => [
                    "evil",
                    "cruelty",
                    "dogs"
                ]
            },
        };
    
        my $person = MyApp::Person->new;
    
        unless ($person->validate_document(person => $data)) {
            warn $person->errors_to_string if $person->error_count;
        }
    
        1;

    Additionally, the following is yet another way to validate a document
    by passing the document specification directly instead of by name.

        package MyApp::Person;
    
        use Validation::Class;
    
        package main;
    
        my $data = {
            "id"      => "1234-ABC",
            "name"    => "Anita Campbell-Green",
            "title"   => "Designer",
            "company" => {
                "name"       => "House of de Vil",
                "supervisor" => {
                    "name"   => "Cruella de Vil",
                    "rating" => [
                        {   "support"  => -9,
                            "guidance" => -9
                        }
                    ]
                },
                "tags" => [
                    "evil",
                    "cruelty",
                    "dogs"
                ]
            },
        };
    
        my $spec = {
            'id'                            => { max_length => 2 },
            'name'                          => { mixin      => ':str' },
            'company.name'                  => { mixin      => ':str' },
            'company.supervisor.name'       => { mixin      => ':str' },
            'company.supervisor.rating.@.*' => { pattern    => qr/^(?!evil)\w+/ },
            'company.tags.@'                => { max_length => 20 },
        };
    
        my $person = MyApp::Person->new;
    
        unless ($person->validate_document($spec => $data)) {
            warn $person->errors_to_string if $person->error_count;
        }
    
        1;

    The ensure keyword (or ens) is used to convert a pre-existing method
    into an auto-validating method. The auto-validating method will be
    registered and function as if it was created using the method keyword.
    The original pre-existing method will be overridden with a modifed
    version which performs the pre and/or post validation routines.

        package MyApp::Person;
    
        use Validation::Class;
    
        sub register {
            ...
        }
    
        ensure register => {
            input  => ['name', '+email', 'username', '+password', '+password2'],
            output => ['+id'], # optional output validation, dies on failure
        };
    
        package main;
    
        my $person = MyApp::Person->new(params => $params);
    
        if ($person->register) {
            # handle the successful registration
        }
    
        1;

    The ensure keyword takes two arguments, the name of the method to be
    overridden and a hashref of required key/value pairs. The hashref may
    have an input key (e.g. input, input_document, input_profile, or
    input_method). The `input` key (specifically) must have a value which
    must be either an arrayref of fields to be validated, or a scalar value
    which matches (a validation profile or auto-validating method name).
    The hashref may also have an output key (e.g. output, output_document,
    output_profile, or output_method). The `output` key (specifically) must
    have a value which must be either an arrayref of fields to be
    validated, or a scalar value which matches (a validation profile or
    auto-validating method name). Whether and what the method returns is
    yours to decide. The method will return undefined if validation fails.
    The ensure keyword wraps and functions much in the same way as the
    method keyword.

    The field keyword (or fld) registers a data validation rule for reuse
    and validation in code. The field name should correspond with the
    parameter name expected to be passed to your validation class or
    validated against.

        package MyApp::Person;
    
        use Validation::Class;
    
        field 'username' => {
            required   => 1,
            min_length => 1,
            max_length => 255
        };

    The field keyword takes two arguments, the field name and a hashref of
    key/values pairs known as directives. For more information on
    pre-defined directives, please review the "list of core directives".

    The field keyword also creates accessors which provide easy access to
    the field's corresponding parameter value(s). Accessors will be created
    using the field's name as a label having any special characters
    replaced with an underscore.

        # accessor will be created as send_reminders
        field 'send-reminders' => {
            length => 1
        };

    Please note that prefixing field names with a double plus-symbol
    instructs the register to merge your declaration with any pre-existing
    declarations within the same scope (e.g. fields imported via loading
    roles), whereas prefixing field names with a single plus-symbol
    instructs the register to overwrite any pre-existing declarations.

        package MyApp::Person;
    
        use Validation::Class;
    
        set role => 'MyApp::User';
    
        # append existing field and overwrite directives
        field '++email_address' => {
            required => 1
        };
    
        # redefine existing field
        field '+login' => {
            required => 1
        };
    
        1;

    The filter keyword (or flt) registers custom filters to be used in your
    field definitions. It is a means of extending the pre-existing filters
    declared by the "filters directive" before instantiation.

        package MyApp::Person;
    
        use Validate::Class;
    
        filter 'flatten' => sub {
            $_[0] =~ s/[\t\r\n]+/ /g;
            return $_[0];
        };
    
        field 'biography' => {
            filters => ['trim', 'strip', 'flatten']
        };
    
        1;

    The filter keyword takes two arguments, the name of the filter and a
    coderef which will be used to filter the value the associated field.
    The coderef is passed the value of the field and that value MUST be
    operated on directly. The coderef should also return the transformed
    value.

    The load keyword (or set), which can also be used as a class method,
    provides options for extending the current class by declaring roles,
    requirements, etc.

    The process of applying roles, requirement, and other settings to the
    current class mainly involves introspecting the namespace's methods and
    merging relevant parts of the prototype configuration.

    The `classes` (or class) option uses Module::Find to load all child
    classes (in-all-subdirectories) for convenient access through the
    "class" in Validation::Class::Prototype method, and when introspecting
    a larger application. This option accepts an arrayref or single
    argument.

        package MyApp;
    
        use Validation::Class;
    
        load classes => ['MyApp::Domain1', 'MyApp::Domain2'];
    
        package main;
    
        my $app = MyApp->new;
    
        my $person = $app->class('person'); # return a new MyApp::Person object
    
        1;

        package MyApp::User;
    
        use Validate::Class;
    
        load requirements => 'activate';
    
        package MyApp::Person;
    
        use Validation::Class;
    
        load role => 'MyApp::User';
    
        sub activate {}
    
        1;

    The `requirements` (or required) option is used to ensure that if/when
    the class is used as a role the calling class has specific pre-existing
    methods. This option accepts an arrayref or single argument.

        package MyApp::User;
    
        use Validate::Class;
    
        load requirements => ['activate', 'deactivate'];
    
        1;

        package MyApp::Person;
    
        use Validation::Class;
    
        load role => 'MyApp::User';
    
        1;

    The `roles` (or role) option is used to load and inherit functionality
    from other validation classes. These classes should be used and
    thought-of as roles although they can also be fully-functioning
    validation classes. This option accepts an arrayref or single argument.

        package MyApp::Person;
    
        use Validation::Class;
    
        load roles => ['MyApp::User', 'MyApp::Visitor'];
    
        1;

    The message keyword (or msg) registers a class-level error message
    template that will be used in place of the error message defined in the
    corresponding directive class if defined. Error messages can also be
    overridden at the individual field-level as well. See the
    Validation::Class::Directive::Messages for instructions on how to
    override error messages at the field-level.

        package MyApp::Person;
    
        use Validation::Class;
    
        field email_address => {
            required   => 1,
            min_length => 3,
            messages   => {
                # field-level error message override
                min_length => '%s is not even close to being a valid email address'
            }
        };
    
        # class-level error message overrides
        message required   => '%s is needed to proceed';
        message min_length => '%s needs more characters';
    
        1;

    The message keyword takes two arguments, the name of the directive
    whose error message you wish to override and a string which will be
    used to as a template which is feed to sprintf to format the message.

    The method keyword (or mth) is used to register an auto-validating
    method. Similar to method signatures, an auto-validating method can
    leverage pre-existing validation rules and profiles to ensure a method
    has the required pre/post-conditions and data necessary for execution.

        package MyApp::Person;
    
        use Validation::Class;
    
        method 'register' => {
    
            input  => ['name', '+email', 'username', '+password', '+password2'],
            output => ['+id'], # optional output validation, dies on failure
            using  => sub {
    
                my ($self, @args) = @_;
    
                # do something registrationy
                $self->id(...); # set the ID field for output validation
    
                return $self;
    
            }
    
        };
    
        package main;
    
        my $person = MyApp::Person->new(params => $params);
    
        if ($person->register) {
    
            # handle the successful registration
    
        }
    
        1;

    The method keyword takes two arguments, the name of the method to be
    created and a hashref of required key/value pairs. The hashref may have
    a `using` key whose value is the coderef to be executed upon successful
    validation. The `using` key is only optional when a pre-existing
    subroutine has the same name or the method being declared prefixed with
    a dash or dash-process-dash. The following are valid subroutine names
    to be called by the method declaration in absence of a `using` key.
    Please note, unlike the ensure keyword, any pre-existing subroutines
    will not be wrapped-and-replaced and can be executed without validation
    if called directly.

        sub _name {
            ...
        }
    
        sub _process_name {
            ...
        }

    The hashref may have an input key (e.g. input, input_document,
    input_profile, or input_method). The `input` key (specifically) must
    have a value which must be either an arrayref of fields to be
    validated, or a scalar value which matches (a validation profile or
    auto-validating method name), which will be used to perform data
    validation before the aforementioned coderef has been executed. Whether
    and what the method returns is yours to decide. The method will return
    undefined if validation fails.

        # alternate usage
    
        method 'registration' => {
            input  => ['name', '+email', 'username', '+password', '+password2'],
            output => ['+id'], # optional output validation, dies on failure
        };
    
        sub _process_registration {
            my ($self, @args) = @_;
                $self->id(...); # set the ID field for output validation
            return $self;
        }

    Optionally the hashref may also have an output key (e.g. output,
    output_document, output_profile, or output_method). The `output` key
    (specifically) must have a value which must be either an arrayref of
    fields to be validated, or a scalar value which matches (a validation
    profile or auto-validating method name), which will be used to perform
    data validation after the aforementioned coderef has been executed.

    Please note that output validation failure will cause the program to
    die, the premise behind this decision is based on the assumption that
    given successfully validated input a routine's output should be
    predictable and if an error occurs it is most-likely a program error as
    opposed to a user error.

    See the ignore_failure and report_failure attributes on the prototype
    to control how method validation failures are handled.

    The mixin keyword (or mxn) registers a validation rule template that
    can be applied (or "mixed-in") to any field by specifying the mixin
    directive. Mixin directives are processed first so existing field
    directives will override any directives created by the mixin directive.

        package MyApp::Person;
    
        use Validation::Class;
    
        mixin 'boilerplate' => {
            required   => 1,
            min_length => 1,
            max_length => 255
        };
    
        field 'username' => {
            # min_length, max_length, .. required will be overridden
            mixin    => 'boilerplate',
            required => 0
        };

    Since version 7.900015, all classes are automatically configured with
    the following default mixins for the sake of convenience:

        mixin ':flg' => {
            required   => 1,
            min_length => 1,
            filters    => [qw/trim strip numeric/],
            between    => [0, 1]
        };
    
        mixin ':num' => {
            required   => 1,
            min_length => 1,
            filters    => [qw/trim strip numeric/]
        };
    
        mixin ':str' => {
            required   => 1,
            min_length => 1,
            filters    => [qw/trim strip/]
        };

    Please note that the aforementioned mixin names are prefixed with a
    semi-colon but are treated as an exception to the rule. Prefixing mixin
    names with a double plus-symbol instructs the register to merge your
    declaration with any pre-existing declarations within the same scope
    (e.g. mixins imported via loading roles), whereas prefixing mixin names
    with a single plus-symbol instructs the register to overwrite any
    pre-existing declarations.

        package MyApp::Moderator;
    
        use Validation::Class;
    
        set role => 'MyApp::Person';
    
        # overwrite and append existing mixin
        mixin '++boilerplate' => {
            min_symbols => 1
        };
    
        # redefine existing mixin
        mixin '+username' => {
            required => 1
        };
    
        1;

    The mixin keyword takes two arguments, the mixin name and a hashref of
    key/values pairs known as directives.

    The new method instantiates a new class object, it performs a series of
    actions (magic) required for the class to function properly, and for
    that reason, this method should never be overridden. Use the build
    keyword for hooking into the instantiation process.

    In the event a foreign (pre-existing) `new` method is detected, an
    `initialize_validator` method will be injected into the class
    containing the code (magic) necessary to normalize your environment.

        package MyApp::Person;
    
        use Validation::Class;
    
        # hook
        build sub {
    
            my ($self, @args) = @_; # on instantiation
    
        };
    
        sub new {
    
            # rolled my own
            my $self = bless {}, shift;
    
            # execute magic
            $self->initialize_validator;
    
        }
    
        1;

    The profile keyword (or pro) registers a validation profile (coderef)
    which as in the traditional use of the term is a sequence of validation
    routines that validates data relevant to a specific action.

        package MyApp::Person;
    
        use Validation::Class;
    
        profile 'check_email' => sub {
    
            my ($self, @args) = @_;
    
            if ($self->email_exists) {
                my $email = $self->fields->get('email');
                $email->errors->add('Email already exists');
                return 0;
            }
    
            return 1;
    
        };
    
        package main;
    
        my $user = MyApp::Person->new(params => $params);
    
        unless ($user->validate_profile('check_email')) {
            # handle failures
        }
    
        1;

    The profile keyword takes two arguments, a profile name and coderef
    which will be used to execute a sequence of actions for validation
    purposes.

    The prototype method (or proto) returns an instance of the associated
    class prototype. The class prototype is responsible for manipulating
    and validating the data model (the class). It is not likely that you'll
    need to access this method directly, see Validation::Class::Prototype.

        package MyApp::Person;
    
        use Validation::Class;
    
        package main;
    
        my $person = MyApp::Person->new;
    
        my $prototype = $person->prototype;
    
        1;

PROXY METHODS

    Validation::Class mostly provides sugar functions for modeling your
    data validation requirements. Each class you create is associated with
    a prototype class which provides the data validation engine and keeps
    your class namespace free from pollution, please see
    Validation::Class::Prototype for more information on specific methods
    and attributes. Validation::Class injects a few proxy methods into your
    class which are basically aliases to the corresponding prototype class
    methods, however it is possible to access the prototype directly using
    the proto/prototype methods.

EXTENSIBILITY

    Validation::Class does NOT provide method modifiers but can be easily
    extended with Class::Method::Modifiers.

 before

        before foo => sub { ... };

    See "before method(s) => sub { ... }" in Class::Method::Modifiers for
    full documentation.

 around

        around foo => sub { ... };

    See "around method(s) => sub { ... }" in Class::Method::Modifiers for
    full documentation.

 after

        after foo => sub { ... };

    See "after method(s) => sub { ... }" in Class::Method::Modifiers for
    full documentation.

SEE ALSO

    Validation::Class does not validate blessed objects. If you need a
    means for validating object types you should use a modern object system
    like Moo, Mouse, or Moose. Alternatively, you could use decoupled
    object validators like Type::Tiny, Params::Validate or Specio.
