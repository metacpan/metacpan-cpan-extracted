NAME

    Class::PublicPrivate - Class with public keys with any name and a
    separate set of private keys

SYNOPSIS

    PublicPrivate is intended for use as a base class for other classes.
    Users of class based on PublicPrivate can assign any keys to the object
    hash without interfering with keys used internally. The private data
    can be accessed by retrieving the private hash with the private method.
    For example, the following code outputs two different values, one for
    the public value of start and another for the private value of start.

     package ExtendedClass;
     use base 'Class::PublicPrivate';
    
     sub new{
        my $class = shift;
        my $self = $class->SUPER::new();
        my $private = $self->private;
    
        # initialize one of the private properties
        $private->{'start'}=time();
    
        return $self;
     }
    
     package main;
     my ($var);
     $var = ExtendedClass->new();
     $var->{'start'} = 1;
    
     print $var->{'start'}, "\n";
     print $var->private()->{'start'}, "\n";

INSTALLATION

    Class::PublicPrivate can be installed with the usual routine:

     perl Makefile.PL
     make
     make test
     make install

METHODS

 YourClass->new(classname ,[initikey1=>initvalue [, ...]])

    Returns an instantiation of YourClass, where YourClass is a class that
    extends Class::PublicPrivate. Additional key=>value pairs are stored in
    the private hash. Programs that use your class can store any date
    directly in it w/o affecting the object's private data.

 $ob->private()

    Returns a reference to the hash of private data.
