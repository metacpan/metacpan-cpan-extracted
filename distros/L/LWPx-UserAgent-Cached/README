NAME

    LWPx::UserAgent::Cached - Subclass of LWP::UserAgent that caches HTTP
    GET requests

VERSION

    version 0.011

SYNOPSIS

        use LWPx::UserAgent::Cached;
        use CHI;
    
        my $ua = LWPx::UserAgent::Cached->new(
            cache => CHI->new(
                driver => 'File', root_dir => '/tmp/cache', expires_in => '1d',
            ),
        );
        $ua->get('http://www.perl.org/');

DESCRIPTION

    This module borrows the caching logic from WWW::Mechanize::Cached but
    without inheriting from WWW::Mechanize; instead it is just a direct
    subclass of LWP::UserAgent.

 HTTP/1.1 cache operation

    Full HTTP/1.1 cache compliance is a work in progress. As of version
    0.006 we have limited support for HTTP/1.1 ETag/If-None-Match headers,
    as well as no-cache and no-store Cache-Control directives (both on
    request and response) and the Pragma: no-cache request header.

ATTRIBUTES

 cache

    Settable at construction, defaults to using CHI::Driver::RawMemory with
    an instance-specific hash datastore and a namespace with the current
    package name. You can use your own caching object here as long as it
    has get and set methods.

 is_cached

    Read-only accessor that indicates if the current request is cached or
    not.

 cache_undef_content_length

    Settable at construction or anytime thereafter, indicates whether we
    should cache content even if the HTTP Content-Length header is missing
    or undefined. Defaults to false.

 cache_zero_content_length

    Settable at construction or anytime thereafter, indicates whether we
    should cache content even if the HTTP Content-Length header is zero.
    Defaults to false.

 cache_mismatch_content_length

    Settable at construction or anytime thereafter, indicates whether we
    should cache content even if the length of the data does not match the
    HTTP Content-Length header. Defaults to true.

 ref_in_cache_key

    Settable at construction or anytime thereafter, indicates whether we
    should store the HTTP referrer in the cache key. Defaults to false.

 positive_cache

    Settable at construction or anytime thereafter, indicates whether we
    should only cache positive responses (HTTP response codes from 200 to
    300 inclusive) or cache everything. Defaults to true.

 ignore_headers

    Settable at construction or anytime thereafter, indicates whether we
    should ignore Cache-Control: no-cache, Cache-Control: no-store, and
    Pragma: no-cache HTTP headers when deciding whether to cache a
    response. Defaults to false.

    Important note: This option is potentially dangerous, as it ignores the
    explicit instructions from the server and thus can lead to returning
    stale content.

HANDLERS

    This module works by adding request_send, response_done and
    response_header handlers that run on successful HTTP GET requests. If
    you need to modify or remove these handlers you may use
    LWP::UserAgent's handler-related methods.
