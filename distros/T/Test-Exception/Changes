    -   The optional test description for lives_and is now optional :)
    -   Can now have empty test description for throws_ok

        style

    -   Added test to Exception.t that demonstrated bug in throws_ok

0.10  [2002-06-02]
    -   Stopped over-exuberant pod.t and documented.t checking that 
        other peoples modules were documented and had legal POD!
    -   Couple of minor tweaks to the docs.
    -   Added caller.t and patch to Exception.pm from Michael G Schwern 
        to stop dies_ok, lives_ok and throws_ok interfering with

    -   Added stacktrace.t to demontrate error reported by Janek 
        Schleicher <bigj@kamelfreund.de> where a stacktrace in the

    -   Stopped stacktrace.t failing.

    -   may_be_regex -> maybe_regex in Test::Builder

0.06
    -   couple of minor tweaks to the docs

0.05
    -   now uses may_be_regex public method from Test::Builder
    -   should work & test under 5.005, don't have a perl to hand
        to double check so feedback welcome

0.04
    -   Can now pass regex-like strings as well as regexes. Thanks to 
        Mark Fowler for the suggestion and Michael G Schwern for adding
        code to Test::Builder.

0.03  [2002-04-09]
    -   dies_ok, lives_ok & throws_ok now all return the result of the 
        underlying ok
    -   $@ is now guaranteed to be preserved (and is documented as 
        such). Thanks to Michael G Schwern for suggesting this.

        (just to be on the safe side :-)
