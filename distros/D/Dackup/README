NAME
    Dackup - Flexible file backup

SYNOPSIS
      use Dackup;

      my $source = Dackup::Target::Filesystem->new(
          prefix => '/home/acme/important/' );

      my $destination = Dackup::Target::Filesystem->new(
          prefix => '/home/acme/backup/' );

      my $dackup = Dackup->new(
          source      => $source,
          destination => $destination,
          delete      => 0,
          dry_run     => 0,
          verbose     => 1,
          throttle    => '1Mbps',
      );
      $dackup->backup;

DESCRIPTION
    This module is an attempt at a flexible file backup. It supports copying
    to and from filesystems, remote hosts via SSH, Amazon's Simple Storage
    Service and Mosso's CloudFiles. At all stages, it checks the MD5 hash of
    the source and destination files.

    It uses an MD5 cache to speed up operations, which it stores by default
    in your home directory (you can pass it as a directory parameter). It's
    just a cache, so you can delete it, but the next time you sync it might
    be a little slower.

    It will update new and changed files. If you pass in delete => 1 then it
    will also delete removed files.
