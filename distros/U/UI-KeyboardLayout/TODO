FF locks in Latin?!  Even with v73 compiled with klc2c — fixed by omitting OEM_8.

Latin has -> ♫ on multicomp in Hebrew and Cyrillic prefixes???!!!  (Should be triggered only on AltGr-Invertor???)

Latin duplications (meaningful) bindings on AltGr-inverted prefix key.

(Shift)-Menu-F12 is Compose (³).

In RU, Dial-a-dash is on AltGr-inverted Green!  Without inversion, ♫ is inserted (vs. ♪ on other prefix keys).

Maybe it is better to map synthetic Ctrl-Alt- bindings to AltGr- (as opposed to “Greek” lAlt-lCtrl-)???

klc2c emits junk (instead of “empty”) if sections were missing.

lAlt-Space in console not working anymore. lAlt-Char search not working in FCW; likewise for input in CMD.  But lAlt-\ works in FCW,
and not in CMD.  keycodes.exe shows the same “translation” as English(US), but empty “Key”.  raw_… cannot see char on lAlt-a; neither
by default, nor with “cooked” argument.
						DONE and DOCUMENTED

lCtrl-Menu-, produces “ — ¼”.  (Header file contains the type LIGATURE3, but the length in msklc_altgr(_r2l).c was 4.)
						DONE

Control-@ does not produce "\000". (But Control-2 does.)
			But how a console application can see that it got 0 without using back-scan (sp?)???

On RU AltGr-- д emits ¯д.  AltGr-- AltGr-F1 emits ¯🙂 = ¯🙂.	(Actually, AltGr- is not a dead key???)

Duplication of VK_-codes does not duplicate LIGATURES.

Binding like ByPairsPrefix[0020.06f0](Face(Latin)) works only with (FullFace(Latin)).  (VK keys not in Face(Latin).)
How to preserve determinism — but make this less error-prone?
    ByPairsPrefix cannot bind SPACE on extra-modifiers maps (even without SPACE in @skip_extra_layers_WIN).  (Needs FullFace()!)
						DOCUMENTED; a workaround put into the kbdd.


Document that if different keys have identical chars, to make an assignment to prefix key maps one may need to define a special
layer with different values at these positions.

Put ⋮ ⋯ ⋰ ⋱ to be more accessible???  Duplicate RET - / \ ; maybe would not be critical???  ⪇≦ ⪈≧

ABNT2 Brazil keyboard has OEM_102 (scancode 56) on the left (in PT with “\|”), and ABNT_C1 (scancode 73) on the right
(in PT with “/?”).  (ABNT_C2 should have the “opposite separator” to PERIOD.)

         https://www.win.tue.nl/~aeb/linux/kbd/scancodes-8.html
 JIS keyboard has OEM_8 (scancode 7D) to the left of BACKSPACE (unmarked, or with “¥|” — with “¥” often substituted by “\” in
 DOS???).  To the right of “/?” there is a key with “\_” OEM_102 (but with scancode 73, of ABNT_C1).

  So to combine the ”full functionality” of both (with scancodes 56+73 and with scancodes 73+7D), one needs to duplicate 56 to 7D.

    DOCUMENT THIS!
    					DONE

One should duplicate “the opposite of DECIMAL” to ABNT_C2.
					DONE

Mark=comment as “mirrored” extra entries in SHIFTSTATE.

Mark the minimal representation of “modification bitmap” in SHIFTSTATE and in the header of layout columns.

Need to duplicate VK_OEM_AX to another “redefinable” scancode or VK_CODE???

Document restrictions of SGCAPS and dead keys (can one circumvent some of them by combining with CAPLOK???).
					DONE

					DONE??

Make %double_scan_VK the default of a customizable mapping.

========================

The current code producing SGCAPS lines cannot work with CAPLOKALTGR.
					DONE

Since CAPLOKALTGR affects not only the AltGr-keys, one should allow a way to force a particular value.  Likewise for CAPLOK.

Make Compose⁴ show ⎄,    AltGr_Invert⁶ show ⤨ instead of “ ” 2008 (as we show on Apple bindings)

Document choice of modifier flags:
	No autogeneration of Ctrl-letters if l/rCTRL has more bits set than expected.
					DOCUMENTED

  only ø and SHIFT are affected by CAPSLOK and SGCAPS logic (so it is disabled by KANALOK — see below);
  only those with ALT and CTRL are affected by CAPSLOKALTGR logic
  all are affected by KANALOK logic (which turns up KANA flag — but it is “documented” otherwise?!)

How to implement (=merge internal nodes)interaction of prefix keys and keys producing multi-codepoint strings:

  On the prefix tree of “multi-chars” some inner vertices may be multi-chars.  If it is defined, then we cannot define any vertex
  after this vertex (but this is not confusing to the user).  If it is not defined, we need to define it to ♪ to avoid user’s
  confustion.  CONCLUSION: defined sequences which have a defined prefix should be ignored.

    This is as with the compose map???

  Two vertices are compatible if the colors (codepoints) of outgoing edges do not intersect.  Out of immediate childs compatible
  with the vertex choose one with smallest valence (to try to minimize conflicts); out of those compatible with it too choose
  likewise etc.

KANALOK seems to be used only when VK_KANA is down (locked by a physical keyboard); so, essentially, this allows VK_KANA to
have effect on some keys (those with KANALOK), and no effect on tother keys (those without).  (Of course, this effect could be
achieved also by duplicating entries in the columns with KBDKANA?!)
			DOCUMENTED

With our layout of modifiers bits, it seems that rCTRL (standalone) is affected by CAPSLOCK state.  How to check this?  This does
not show in CMD or copy con nul???

Ctrl-_ should produce 0x1f.  In fact, Ctrl-- produces 0x1f, and Ctrl-Shft-- produces 0x2001f in FCW (which usually cannot read
above 0xFFFF from keyboard!).  (One can also get top-flags 4,6,8 instead of 2 with e.g. Ctrl-Q Ctrl-Alt-1, with the bottom
being the bound key!)  But they perform as expected in CMD and "copy con nul"?!

   Another mystery(?): in CMD, both Ctrl-2 and Ctrl-@ produce a control character shown as ^@.

     It seems that our produced binding for Ctrl and Ctrl-Shift do not take into account Loya and Roya bits!!!  ???
     Is it because of this that Ctrl-[]\ do not work in Cyrillic (where the base chars are not as expected)???

All other combinations of modifier-keys are affected by CAPSLOCK.

However, the implementation has WORD wModBits; so the bitmap on a character may go up to 16 bits!!!
	https://dispoclavier.com/src/kbfrintu/kbfrintu.c
  Uses flag 0x80 KBDGRPSELTAP as a modifier bit on a modifier key!!!
	See the last message on:
https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/forum/all/how-to-implement-multiple-deadkey-strokes/4ff38c09-b58c-490a-963e-3cc745dfb396

  In Bépo wiki: B00 is the key to the left of Z (=B01; B=the second row from the bottom)


============================== If one can make Win “mean ±Bold” (e.g., with KBD-flag 0x100)

	!!!!!  Unfortunately, Win-accelerators act on VK_codes, so this would not work???   !!!!!!!
		But this works with AltGr!

============================== Orthogonality with Win allowed

  (Assuming that Win is used only “with AltGr” or “with lCtrl-lAlt”, so does not conflict with system’s accelerators.)

If A and B are two modifier keys, then “A⊕B 3-hook” consists of their combinations where at least one is down.  Likewise for
A⊕B-squares, A⊕B⊕C-cubes.  Given a set S of certain combinations of modifiers in a set σ, likewise for sets T and τ, denote by S×T
their combinations — provided σ ∩ τ = ∅.

First, introduce a shortcut: note that if AltGr is down, one can use Win, and when AltGr is not down, one can use lCtrl.  So call
leftKey “a suitable key out of lCtrl and Win, depending on the state of AltGr”.  Likewise, let leftKey² be the combination of them
both.

=========================== A working variant using Win (with 26 output 34 used)

Summary (with FancyMath=rCtrl, Bold=lAlt, Italic=Win, mathGreek=OtherScript), earlier rule wins over the latter one:
  • All text variants are orthogonal and “without FancyMath”.  4 personalities are controlled by OtherScript/FancyScript. And AltGr.
  • With FancyMath (and can add Bold): the 3-hook AltGr ⊕ Menu means Bbb,Script,Frakture (with Bold: Mono,Bold-Script,Bold-Fracture)
  • One can combine Latin and OtherScript, with “Font Math” (as AltGr) — but only with ONE of “math-Bold/Italic” by Win or lAlt
    (with OtherScript meaning “Greek” in math).  (Bold-Italic is obsured by the first rule.)
  • One can combine the preceding rule orthgonally with FancyMath to add SansSerif — however, the second rule obsures the non-Italic
    variants.

(This leaves Bold Italic math, SansSerif math, and SansSerif Bold math not yet supported.)

  • SansSerif math is entered as lCtrl-rCtrl.  Combining this with Win for Italic and lAlt for Bold, Menu for Greek (as above) is
    supported — but for Bold Italic one omits Sans Serif.  (Lᴵˢˢ is omitted — see below — since it is on Win-Ctrl-Ctrl which may
    trigger system accelerators.)  This allows access to all the Unicode Math letters.

This follows from what is described above:

  • Math “TensorLike”: FancyScript + FancyMath (modifiable by OtherScript and by AltGr).  With AltGr: it is “Tensor” (SansSerif Bold
    Italic), removing AltGr removes SansSerif.
  • There is a pair of unused positions differing by Menu-, based on Win-lAlt-rCtrl.
  • There is a 3-hook lCtrl-lAlt of unused positions based on Menu.  This based position may be also modified by rCtrl.

 • Columns are combinations of “keys on the right of Spacebar: AltGr, Menu, rCtrl”,
 • Rows are cominations of keys “on the left of Spacebar: lCtrl Win lAlt”;
 • dashes “—” mean “this position should not bound to free it to application accelerators”;
 • ditto marks “〃” mean “same as above it” — the limitation due to KLLF_ALTGR.
 • L/Gr/Cyr/Hbr mean 4 personalities, the superscripts mean: ᴬ: AltGr-flavor, ᴮ: Bold, ᴵ: Italic, ˢˢ: SansSerif, ᵗᵉⁿ: “Tensor” = ᴮᴵˢˢ.
 • Bbb/Mono/Scr/Frk mean flavors of “fancy” math charactre: Blackboard-Bold, Monospaced, Script, Frakture (the last two may be bold).
 • “¿?” marks “questionable positions”, where the system-accelerator-based-on-VK_-code can trigger???

Document dial-a-smiley and new positions for dial-a-space and dial-a-dash.

Put new dial-a-something on Mnu-digits.  (Circled digits???)  Would conflict with ≠ variants on Blue 9.

Implement FromToFlat(Inv)?

2a7b (etc.) are considered not simple in the “Compose” summary.  (Although it is CORRECTLY marked as ⓕ11.)

06f0 on Greek is considered accessible.  Likewise for AltGr-inverted prefix keys (due to UTF-16 codepoints “staged” in two steps?).

In Hebrew and Greek there are many chars (correctly) detected as difficult to reach.

AltGr-inverted “flat” not in “access types” with assigned letters.

Ctrl-keys should be considered as difficult too!  (What about AltGr???)

Difficulty of flat is less than of many others, but they would win in assignment.

Flat mapping is not reflected in “covered Math+Latin-D” report (at end).

Accessibility report on SPACE: is counted as an AltGr-inverted control-char.  Some of accessors conradictory: Ⓔ?
				PROBABLY FIXED???

Check report on Ⓐ.  Mnu-: ^Shift-A (=Ripe⁴); AltGr-, ^Shift-A.  The former is reported as ②: so an extra “prefix” is counted.  This
affects the calcuation of “difficulty” — should be compensated!

Inspect accessibility reports in 1-prefix and 2-prefices sections.

One of the turned commas obscured by by ⓐ→ binding on AltGr-inverted . (but not on AltGr-.???)

In non-Latin personalities it is not clear which of Green/Ripe symbols are on Green or Ripe (in the numeric row).

On the coverage, introduce a category “from a flat map”.

When importing a satellite face from a companion, how to grab a flat map???

AltGr-inverted Ctrl-⋆ on AltGr-. should insert Ⓐ etc.  (What about AltGr-, where Ⓐ/etc currently are???)

Currently Circled uppercase are on ⓐ, prefix and 0483=Ripe⁴=Menu-:.

Need to insert AltGr-inverted Ctrl-⋆ into visual layout tables.  As extra two columns on ⓒ-z etc?

Seems that the reports of “Unreached:” positions are legitimate bugs!  (Or unhandled AltGr-inverted Ctrl-⋆, or prefer-first of 06f0???)

  Getting and reporting of how-reachable info on keys.  Getting ignores flat maps.
  		PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED: enhanced maps, unmatched slots on AltGr-inverted-base

  (Need to move all these from output-for-Win to massage stage. ???)
  		PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED: enhanced maps

  Shift-Gray-* and Menu-Gray-* produce the same ÷; since Menu⸣less version takes preference, ÷ is associated to both
  Gray-* and Shift-Gray-* when action of prefix keys is calculated.  (ᴬ$ maps Shift-Gray-/ to ☐ — hence Menu-/ to ☐ — as producing
  the same base key; and since shifted, Shift-Menu-/ is also mapped to ☐.)
  						DONE (via @Prefix_Force_Altern)

  Extracting coverage0 from AltGr-inverted base face should be special-cased when AltGr-inversion is not bijective!
  (No: this should be handled when the inverted map is created…)
  						DONE

  Reporting "Unreached:" should show which row/column of the keyboard this comes from (or what is on the base face).

     Enhanced/Flat maps are used on Windows only — so how to test coverage “in general”?

$self->keys2hex(to_UTF16LE_units(chr hex $hex)) - need to do for all components of the binding.

As an optimization, have a special prefix key for 32-bit (or multichar) not-bound keys

Alt-→ arrows should give double tips.  Alt-↑ should give double arrows; Alt-↓ double-opposite arrows???

AltGr-" or AltGr-; should produce double arrows on arrows.

Check Menu-; in Cyrillic: “hanging” ʗ.

Length in IPA “ː Modifier Letter Triangular Colon” should be accessible via “ⓐ↑ :”. ???  (Currently ˸/꞉; use ⓐ; Ⓒm)
Maybe move “modifier letter colon ‘꞉’” to “ⓐ↓ :”.
	U+02d1 ˑ half triangular colon???  (On ⓐ↑ ^)

0297@ imports Cyr-Bizzare (?) into Latin — but it also leaks to Cyrillic — where it is useless.

On non-Latin Green, ,. are obscured by Latin’s ¸°.  So one needs alternative access to ⊚ and operator-⋅.

  When we order faces to process, one needs to take into account faces mentioned as sections in the .kbdd file.

On F12 columns 8,9 are not faces, but Compose.  Needed???

On Cyrillic and Hebrew, columns 8,9 do not contain smilies???

ByPairsFlat of satellites should be able to depend on the base face.

Use of coverage0oneUTF16 is obsolete now; use of $cov1 for extra-faces makes no sense.

Why adding .⪈ to FlipLayer adds it to comma-on-non-flipped layer too?

Apparently, deliver-Script prefix-face may be evaluated in context of non-Latin face, which is not yet filled via LinkFace; but why
OTHER coptic digits work???  Seems that FlipShift is not good without an explicit argument face

In RU, - produces -_¯—⁻–₋― (base, AltGr, lClA, Mnu), but no prefix.  And 6 makes 6Ъ^ⷶ⁶£₆˦; ' makes '"ꙗ´∂∇′″;
while ; makes ;:¨÷äΦаΦаⷶ (so lClA-; works) and , makes ,<«≤ — ą —  —  (so one needs lClA-Shift-, instead of lClA-,);
while . makes .>»≥·å…𝄡𝄡 (again, extra Shift with lClA), and / makes /?јЈ⁄¿÷;.  On the other hand, ` and 4 work as expected.

In LA, - produces -_ā—⁻–₋―; why ¯ is not exported???

In the hashes of prefix maps, need to take into account characters produced with CapsLock.
	Also: need to be able to map chars produced with non-AltGr modifiers.
The order ꞵꞴḅḄ on AltGr-, b is not optimal.  (How to change???)

On ABNT_C1, a lot of bindings are to non-assigned deadkeys.

[AltGr-][Mnu-]KpEnter produces “!” in Character Map???   (With `US´ as well...)

There is no special binding for KpEnter???

On Cyrillic: CA-, CA-. require extra shift; CA-/ CA-- CA-; are wrong; CA-: accesses a ghost prefix Φ (no binding on Cyrillic/Latin);
	     on CA-' CA-" CA-6 CA-^ ∂∇⁶£ obscure “the prefix meaning”.

On B/I-Math: digits reproduce Bold math (there are no B+I-digits!)

In RU, Ripe⁴ Ctrl-char does not produce Ⓕ etc.

In Compose, may need to put flags into submaps (like 0000 is OK).

Problem with ъ vs Inv-AltGr on ISO key:
	in Latin, AltGr-Space Inv-AltGr is Ъ.
		In fcw — the actual behaviour is different: empty output!!! ???
		Ъ .

		Example (but not as above???)
			AltGr-SPACE² TAB is ↹;
				one can replace with Inv-AltGr³ SPACE TAB
					[here Inv-AltGr³ is Inv-AltGr of AltGr-SPACE; so SPACE ⎯→ AltGr-SPACE²]
				but one cannot make it with Inv-AltGr SPACE???

  Switching ABNT_C1 and SPACE does not help.
    !!! No wonder: they are both in VK hash, so the order does not matter!  Sorted alphabetically!
	Comparing Lat ⎯→ Cyr has Shift-ISO (00a0) ↦ Ъ, AltGr-Shift-Space (00a0) ↦ prefix for Cyr-inverted
	We have prefer-last on 00a0     (In addition to ISO, 00a0 is also on ABNT_C1.)

We use output_deadkeys() on Apple too, but it only supports up to 0xFFFF.  Likewise for treatment of Compose???

  In Compose, create small-integer deadkeys only for stuff needed on Windows; create something else for Apple/X11???
    But what if WIN key is also down???

In Cyrillic, Mnu-F4 etc do not work.
		In Cyr, working are on AltGr, lCtrl-lAlt, Mnu-rCtrl (AltGr, Latin, Hebrew)
		In Lat, working are on AltGr, Mnu, Mnu-rCtrl (AltGr, Cyr, Hebrew)		???

In mini-en output, deadkeys should be named based on the row they trigger.

In mini-en output, flipAltGr_key is flipping only the base. (Processing bound on a presence of chains!)

In mini-en output: Compose with unreachable characters is emitted!

Add warning to multi-char key2hex(), rework into keys2hex() if needed.

Repeating Flip-AltGr should end in output of ⤨ (as in Apple terminators! — is it configurable?).

Satellite vs Companion.  Personalities.

	Before posting (sys)keyup/keydown, async key state is updated.
	Keystate is allowed up to vk=255.
	xxxSkipSysMsg(): when a message is moved from system queue to the thread's one, sets key state.
	For VK_APPCOMMAND_FIRST ... VK_APPCOMMAND_LAST, a message QEVENT_APPCOMMAND is posted before the usual processing;
		This causes the corresponding APPCOMMAND_FIRST + ... is sent (in low), with GetMouseKeyFlags() in top.
			GetMouseKeyFlags(): shift/control + 5 mouse buttons.
		+ Extra code to allow the target window to go to foreground if it wishes.
	TranslateAccelerator():
		Disabled in HEX input mode
		Acts on (SYS)KEYDOWN and (SYS)CHAR keys
		For KLLF_ALTGR layouts with AltGr down, acts only on RCONTROL and LMENU
		Uses GetKeyState to check for C/A/Shift down
		Shift/Control are checked only on (SYS)KEYDOWN events
		For every found, find the first for which it may send a message:
			Tries to find menu (for non-child), or else sysmenu, or sys-desktop menu
				If: !item_disables AND (sysmenu OR !minimized) AND (not_in_menu AND !(captured OR win_disabled)):
					send:	(sys)command (sys = in sys menu) with low(w)=cmd,
						top(w) = 1 for non-sys
						top(l)=1 for sys
					When checking menus, WM_INITMENU is send, and for submenus
						WM_INITMENUPOPUP, WM_UNINITMENUPOPUP (the latter after the main send, if any).

Apple "terminators" for surrogates:
  low:  Now U-DC .. U-DF, or U-DC0 .. U-DFF		[U-DC]=U+_[048C], [U-DC0]=U+_[048C]0
  high: Now U-D8 .. U-DB, or U-D80 .. U-DBF		[U-D8]=U+0[1-4], [U-DB]=U+[0D-10],	[U-D80]=U+01[0-3]
  	U+_⁽⁰⁴⁸ᶜ⁾	U+0⁽¹⁻⁴⁾	U+⁽⁰ᵈ⁻¹⁰⁾
  		After a high surrogate, drop the user into a state for entering 3 low digits?

Flip-AltGr Ctrl-char	should be also engaged
Flip-AltGr AltGr-char	should duplicate Ctrl-char.  (With Shift-AltGr-char, should do Flip-AltGr Ctrl-char.)

SPACE not switching to SCROLL in GIMP.  (US, Russian, US Intl and Canadian multilingual are OK!)

Move circled to (Repeated) AltGr-Prefix Ctrl-CHAR.

Math faces: rCtrl, lCtrl, and lAlt+rAlt are liabilities.  Move the most important
actions (Bold; ???) to Mnu, and lAlt instead?

New map consolidators (instead of default, empty one; should be surrounded by spaces):
  +	Same as “|” in mutators
  ++	Same, and allow removing AltGr if an AltGr-less slot is empty
    or maybe
  +[-A]	instead of ++,
    allow [-S] for removal of Shift, --S for removal of Shift AND of Shift-ed binding
      and maybe [+A] for explicitly allowing adding AltGr if AltGr-less position is taken, etc. 

Or maybe:
  +	Equivalent to +[+A]
  +[]	Same without allowing adding AltGr if AltGr-less position is already taken (synonym of joining by whitespace???).

In newer, disappeared: AltGr-~ AltGr-~ now makes ⍭.  
	Changed in 0.65 —→ 0.66 (due to APL???)

======================== DONE AFTER THiS POINT

Accessibility report on “1” is garbled.
						DONE

On Cyrillic ∤ is obscured by a dash (on Green AltGr-1) — and a lot of others on Green are too.  Likewise on Hebrew.
						DONE

AltGr-: hides Greek question mark in Greek.  (But /? are AltGr-mapped to ɂɁ ???)
Greek question mark is available in Latin on Green AltGr-?, but not on Greek?!
						DONE (on AltGr-?)

Put ⋮ (v-ellipsis, not 3ple-dot colon) to Menu-, (like … on Menu-.).
						DONE

Adding AltGr-: as prefix modified many bindings on prefixed AltGr-: (but AltGrCharSubstitutions shouild have
taken care of this?  See AltGrCharSubstitutionsLayers???)
						DONE

#extra-fonts in the docs should direct to a correct HTML file.  Also: The link should be to /software/fonts, and not /fonts.
DejaVu link needs to be updated.
						DONE (mostly)

Above: resolve "-" vs "_" in anchor names to search.cpan.
						DONE
perl -i~cpan -wlpe "sub ss($){(my$in=shift)=~s/-/_/g;$in} s((?<=href=https://)search\.cpan\.org/(?:.*?)/(.*?)(?=/)(.*?)(?=>))(qq(metacpan.org/dist/$1/view).ss $2)ge" izKeys-visual-maps-base.html
							WAS DONE EARLIER


AltGr-↑ / should enter ˊ (currently on AltGr-' TAB), and AltGr-6 should enter ♭ (currently on @).  ♮ on & ???
						DONE

AltGr-→ … (or ⫶) should produce diag-ellipsis, AltGr-↑ … should produce ⋯
					DONE	(NEED TO KNOW that … is accessible ???  But if not, this is reported now!)

Put smilies on Fn keys, and the current meaning to the Green prefix.
						DONE

Menu-Gray-+ produces ﬩ both shifted and unshifted (the latter should produce ∑).  (Since it is noID and the base Shift-Gray-+ gives
∑ instead of the inspected copy of ﬩ on Menu-+???)
						DONE (revert switching of ﬩/∑ on Menu- which led to duplication)

On Cyr-satellite make Cyr-AltGr-1 (which is ₽) into a Shift-Menu-1.
						DONE

Coptic digit “zeroty” is output as 9.  (analogue of 80 with 0 instead of 8)
						DONE

Mnu->, Mnu-< should give ˱, ˲.
						DONE

	diff-izKeys.kbdd-nn-fx-bad
makes non-Latin faces much smaller.  Modifies DeadKey_Map06f3.
Temporarily modify .kbdd to restore the old value
	Was: were not inspecting LinkFace when doing early filtering of ComposeKey.
						DONE

In Greek, there were no bindings for ∁∃ (they are hidden by Latin AltGr).  NotSameKey(FullFace(...) ...) not working???
But non-AltGr digit-row of Hebrew is not used, and the hook-right part...???
Without SelectRX, a lot of Latin prefix keys unaccessible???
		Layer exists ???!!!
						DONE

	New:	Problems: Φ is now directly accessible, and on Greek very easily!  Need to move it to something more exotic… ʗ=0297!

			DONE

Greek Sinosoid sign (on Script ~) obscures Greek-~ prefix.
			DONE

keysymdef.h
dotCompose uses builtin ad hoc translation rules to Unicode.
Shift-␣² f should produce ƒ.
							DONE

In RU, AltGr-inversion does not work on (imported?) 02c6 02c7 02cb 02dc 02f5	(inv=070b etc)
		But works on (imported?) 00a8 (in the first group; inv=0702) or 0338 (the last group)
			Did not work before too: on 00af 00b4!!!
	$HH may contain *Chain* (then works OK), or #@#@#@ (then does not)???
								massage_imported(); calls link_layers();
		DONE

adding AltGr-inv for CyrillicPhonetic, accessor=0702 at UI-KeyboardLayout/lib/UI/KeyboardLayout.pm line 6117.

Added to CyrillicPhonetic###06ed at UI-KeyboardLayout/lib/UI/KeyboardLayout.pm line 6131.
			DONE

Document that one may use TranslateAccelerator() (HOW???) to peek at KLLF_ALTGR flag.
		Since the translation is syncroneous (sent, not posted) one may need to
		set a flag marking a fake message.
			DONE

MS’s “Ligatures” slots have length at most 125; but a ligature — with some creative placement — can
take more than one slot (fine for 1 long ligature; may be prohibited by [highly unprobable] coincidences for more than 1).
Then the limit is 255 UTF-16 codepoints.  (For proper C files, may need to change the first field to unsigned short,
or fill by a union.
				DONE

Insertion of diacritics via *2Self depends on space being in a defined-via-VK SPACE key.

AltGr-Invert of Shift-Space is AltGr-Invert.  This leads to an infinite chain.
				DONE

Put ⨟-style ":" and pilcrow/hedera sign on : and & in Green/Ripe keys.  (Or exchange with "∶".)
On Blue, put double-struck π and Π (instead of ℎ) ℼℿℽ.
			DONE
