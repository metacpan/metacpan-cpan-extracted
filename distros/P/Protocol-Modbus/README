Protocol-Modbus version 0.06
============================

Object-oriented class to abstract generation and parsing of Modbus
protocol messages. This class only handles protocol messages generation
and parsing. It does not directly interface with your PLC devices.
For that task, see the Device::PLC CPAN module (when that will be released).
