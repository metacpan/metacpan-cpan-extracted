NAME
    Text::Undiacritic - remove diacritics from a string

VERSION
    This document describes Text::Undiacritic 0.01

SYNOPSIS
        use Text::Undiacritic qw(undiacritic);
        $ascii_string = undiacritic( $czech_string );

DESCRIPTION
    Changes characters with diacritics into their base characters.

    Also changes into base character in cases where UNICODE does not provide
    a decomposition.

    E.g. all characters '... WITH STROKE' like 'LATIN SMALL LETTER L WITH
    STROKE' do not have a decomposition. In the latter case the result will
    be 'LATIN SMALL LETTER L'.

    Removing diacritics is useful for matching text independent of spelling
    variants.

SUBROUTINES/METHODS
  undiacritic
        $ascii_string = undiacritic( $characters );

    Removes diacritics from $characters and returns a simplified character
    string.

    The input string must be in character modus, i.e. UNICODE code points.
