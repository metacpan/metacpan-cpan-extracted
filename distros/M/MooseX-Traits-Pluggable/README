NAME
    MooseX::Traits::Pluggable - trait loading and resolution for Moose

DESCRIPTION
    See MooseX::Traits for usage information.

    Use "new_with_traits" to construct an object with a list of traits and
    "apply_traits" to apply traits to an instance.

    Adds support for class precedence search for traits and some extra
    attributes, described below.

TRAIT SEARCH
    If the value of "_trait_namespace" in MooseX::Traits starts with a "+"
    the namespace will be considered relative to the "class_precedence_list"
    (ie. @ISA) of the original class.

    Example:

      package Class1
      use Moose;

      package Class1::Trait::Foo;
      use Moose::Role;
      has 'bar' => (
          is       => 'ro',
          isa      => 'Str',
          required => 1,
      );

      package Class2;
      use parent 'Class1';
      with 'MooseX::Traits';
      has '+_trait_namespace' => (default => '+Trait');
      has '+_traits_behave_like_roles' => (default => 1);

      package Class2::Trait::Bar;
      use Moose::Role;
      has 'baz' => (
          is       => 'ro',
          isa      => 'Str',
          required => 1,
      );

      package main;
      my $instance = Class2->new_with_traits(
          traits => ['Foo', 'Bar'],
          bar => 'baz',
          baz => 'quux',
      );

      $instance->does('Class1::Trait::Foo'); # true
      $instance->does('Class2::Trait::Bar'); # true

NAMESPACE ARRAYS
    You can search multiple namespaces for traits, for example:

      has '+_trait_namespace' => (
          default => sub { [qw/+Trait +Role ExtraNS::Trait/] }
      );

    Will search in the "class_precedence_list" for "::Trait::TheTrait" and
    "::Role::TheTrait" and then for "ExtraNS::Trait::TheTrait".

CORRECT ROLE BEHAVIOR
    By default, a method from a role will override a class method, this
    however is not the behavior one expects when applying a Moose role using
    the normal methods.

    If you want the behavior to be consistent with Moose roles, then use
    this configuration attribute in your class:

      has '+_traits_behave_like_roles' => (default => 1);

    This may or may not become the default in the future, for now you have
    to ask for it for backward compatibility reasons.

EXTRA ATTRIBUTES
  _original_class_name
    When traits are applied to your class or instance, you get an anonymous
    class back whose name will be not the same as your original class. So
    "ref $self" will not be "Class", but "$self->_original_class_name" will
    be.

  _traits
    List of the (unresolved) traits applied to the instance.

  _resolved_traits
    List of traits applied to the instance resolved to full package names.
