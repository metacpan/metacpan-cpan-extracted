=head1 SYNOPSIS

   use Minion;
   my $minion = Minion->new(...);

   use Memorator;
   my $memorator = Memorator->create(
      alert_callback => sub {
         my $id = shift;
         print "notification for id <$id>\n";
         return;
      },
      minion => $minion,
      name => 'memorator', # this is the default
   );

   $minion->enqueue(memorator_process_update =>
      {
         id => 'id-001',       # identifier meaningful for you
         epoch => (time + 30), # when you want the alert
         attempts => 5,        # how many retries before giving up
      }
   );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

=over

=over

=item I<< B<< memorātor >> >>

=over

=item *

imperative passive future of verb I<memorāre>, can be translated like
I<you will be reminded> (see L<https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/memoro>,
expand section on I<Inflection>).

=item *

nominative singular of I<memorātor>, male third descension, can be
translated like I<someone who mentions> (see
L<https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/memorator>)

=back

This module allows you to set alerts for some events you need to be warned
of. It's as simple as asking an alarm to ring at a certain date/time.

The module leverages on L<Minion> for the heavylifting. It's actually
a thin API on top of it, installing two I<tasks> which by default go under
the names C<memorator_process_update> and C<memorator_process_alert>
(although you can change the C<memorator> part using L</name>).

The interaction model is simple:

=over

=item *

you create an object with an L</alert_callback> and a C<minion> object
that will do the hard work. The L</alert_callback> is where you will
implement your logic for when the alert expires;

=item *

you enqueue I<updates> to set new alarms or modify existing ones, based on
an I<identifier> that is meaningful for you;

=item *

at the expiration of the alarm time, the L</alert_callback> is called with
the specific I<identifier>, so that you can figure out what has to be done
next.

=back

To add a new reminder, or change an existing one, you use
C<memorator_process_update> passing a hash reference like this:

   $minion->enqueue(memorator_process_update =>
      {
         eid => 'id-001',      # identifier meaningful for you
         epoch => (time + 30), # when you want the alert
         attempts => 5,        # how many retries before giving up
      }
   );

You can also set alerts directly, without the mediation of L<Minion>,
using L</set_alert>:

   $memorator->set_alert(\%same_hashref_as_before);

See L</set_alert> for the allowed keys.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 B<< alert_callback >>

   my $sub_reference = $obj->alert_callback;
   $obj->alert_callback(sub {...});

accessor for the callback to be run when an alert has to be sent. It is
mandatory to set this before the first alert is sent. Can be set in the
constructor.

The callback will be invoked like follows:

   $callback->($identifier);

where C<$identifier> is a meaningful identifier for your applications
(which is also the identifier passed upon creation of the event).

=head2 B<< minion >>

   my $minion = $obj->minion;
   $obj->minion($minion_instance);

accessor for the L<Minion> used behind the scenes. Note that in callbacks
called in jobs the minion instance will be drawn from the jobs themselves,
as it might prove to be I<fresher>.

=head2 B<< name >>

   my $name = $obj->name;
   $obj->name($new_name);

accessor for a name for generating local names of tables in the database,
as well as task names in L<Minion>. This allows you to have more instances
living inside the same L<Minion>, should you ever need to do this.
Defaults to C<memorator>. Can be set in the constructor.

=head2 B<< new >>

   my $obj = Memorator->new(%args);
   my $obj = Memorator->new(\%args);

constructor. The recognized keys in C<%args> correspond to accessors
L</alert_callback> (mandatory), L</minion> (mandatory) and L</name>
(optional).

=head2 B<< remove_alert >>

   $obj->remove_alert(\%hashref); # OR
   $obj->remove_alert($eid);

remove an alert. You can pass either a hash reference compatible with
L</set_alert>, or the external identifier for which you don't need the
alert any more. Returns nothing.

=head2 B<< set_alert >>

   $obj->set_alert(\%hashref);

Set an alert. The following keys are supported:

=over

=item C<attempts>

how many times L<Minion> will retry upon failure of your callback. In this
case, I<failure> means I<thrown exception>.

=item C<epoch>

the UTC epoch at which you want the alert callback to be triggered. If
this field is missing, the alert will be I<removed>.

=item C<id>

the L<identifier> for your event, which can help you retrieve the details
of your event somewhere else. It has a textual form, so you might want to
abuse it to store more data (e.g. some JSON data); just keep in mind that
it is treated as an I<opaque identifier>, i.e. a string that is compared
to other strings for equality.

=back

You don't need to call this directly if you use L<Minion> for enqueuing
alerts via C<memorator_process_update> (or whatever name the task has,
based on L</name>).
