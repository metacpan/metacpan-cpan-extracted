NAME
    MooX::Traits - automatically apply roles at object creation time

SYNOPSIS
    Given some roles:

       package Role;
       use Moo::Role;
       has foo => ( is => 'ro', required => 1 );

    And a class:

       package Class;
       use Moo;
       with 'MooX::Traits';

    Apply the roles to the class:

       my $class = Class->with_traits('Role');

    Then use your customized class:

       my $object = $class->new( foo => 42 );
       $object->isa('Class'); # true
       $object->does('Role'); # true
       $object->foo; # 42

DESCRIPTION
    Was any of the SYNOPSIS unexpected? Basically, this module is the same
    thing as MooseX::Traits and MouseX::Traits, only for Moo. *Quelle
    surprise*, right?

  Methods
    `$class->with_traits( @traits )`
        Return a new class name with the traits applied.

    `$class->new_with_traits(%args, traits => \@traits)`
        `new_with_traits` can also take a hashref, e.g.:

           my $instance = $class->new_with_traits({ traits => \@traits, foo => 'bar' });

        This method exists for compatibility with the MooseX and MouseX
        equivalents of this module, but generally speaking you should prefer
        to use `with_traits`.

    `$class->_trait_namespace`
        This returns undef, but you can override it in your class to
        automatically prepend a namespace to supplied traits.

        This differs slightly from the MooseX and MouseX versions of this
        module which have `_trait_namespace` as an attribute instead of a
        method.

  Compatibility
    Although called MooX::Traits, this module actually uses Role::Tiny, so
    doesn't really require Moo. If you use it in a non-Moo class, you should
    be able to safely consume any Role::Tiny-based traits.

    If you use it in a Moo class, you should also be able to consume
    Moo::Role-based traits and Moose::Role-based traits.

    Package::Variant and MooseX::Role::Parameterized roles should be usable;
    just provide a hashref of arguments:

       $class->with_traits( $param_role => \%args )->new( ... )
