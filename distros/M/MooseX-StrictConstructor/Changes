0.21     2017-02-09

- The last release accidentally added Moo as a hard prereq when it's only
  needed for testing. Patched by Karen Etheride (GH #4).


0.20     2017-02-09

- Repository has moved to the GitHub Moose organization

- Added support for __no_BUILD__ as a constructor argument to skip calling any
  BUILD subs (used internally by modules like Moo that have their own
  implementation of calling BUILD). Reported and patched by Karen Etheridge
  (RT#120124, GH #1).


0.19     2012-01-17

- The 0.17 release broke compatibility with pre-2.0 versions of Moose.


0.18     2012-01-10

- A small internal tweak which prevents the MooseX::ClassCompositor tests from
  failing.


0.17     2012-01-04

- Added a small optimization for an immutable constructor when used with Moose
  2.00+. The list of valid attributes is only generated once, rather than each
  time the constructor is run. Reported by Chip Salzenberg. RT #73664.


0.16     2011-04-22

- Don't wrap BUILDALL, since this breaks if the object doesn't inherit from
  Moose::Object (doy).


0.15     2011-04-13

- The fix in 0.14 only worked with Moose 2.0, causing failures with earlier
  versions.


0.14     2011-04-13

- Using extends caused strictness to be lost. Fixed by Karen Etheridge.


0.13     2011-02-22

- This release provides forward compatibility with Moose 1.99+. It will still
  work with Moose 1.23 as well. Most of the work was done by Jesse Luehrs.


0.12     2010-10-29

- Switched tests to use Test::Fatal instead of Test::Exception.


0.11     2010-09-09

- Added a missing test dep on Test::Exception. Reported by Phillip Moore. RT
  #61205.


0.10     2010-07-16

- Ignore __INSTANCE__ when passed to the constructor. Patch by Jesse
  Luehrs. RT #59236.

- All init args are quoted in the inlined constructor.


0.09     2010-07-14

- Use modern Moose APIs, to avoid warnings with the next Moose release.


0.08     2009-04-07

- Make this module work with Moose 0.73_01+.


0.07     2008-09-01

- No code changes, just a stable release for Moose 0.56.


0.06_02  2008-08-30

* This module no longer exports Moose's sugar. Just use Moose instead.

- Various doc fixes to reflect changes since 0.06.


0.06_01  2008-08-30

- Rewrote this distro's functionality as roles to take advantage of
  Moose::Util::MetaRole. Less code, plays better with other
  extensions.


0.06     2008-06-27

- Changes to the immutable bits to work with the latest Moose (0.51).


0.05     2008-04-18

- The fix in 0.04 only worked for non-immutable classes.


0.04     2008-04-18

- This module did not respect the init_arg attribute setting, and used
  the attribute name instead. Reported by Matt Trout. RT #34507.


0.03     2007-11-20

- Require Moose 0.26, since that's first version to offer init_meta(),
  apparently.


0.02     2007-11-15

- Moose was missing from the prereq list. Reported by Slaven Rezic.

- Version 0.01 did not work after a class was made immutable.


0.01     2007-11-14

- First version, released on an unsuspecting world.
