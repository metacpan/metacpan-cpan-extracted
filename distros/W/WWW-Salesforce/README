NAME
    WWW::Salesforce - this class provides a simple abstraction layer between
    SOAP::Lite and Salesforce.com.

SYNOPSIS
        use WWW::Salesforce;
        my $sforce = eval { WWW::Salesforce->login( username => 'foo',
                                                    password => 'bar' ); };
        die "Could not login to SFDC: $@" if $@;

        # eval, eval, eval.  WWW::Salesforce uses a SOAP connection to
        # salesforce.com, so things can go wrong unexpectedly.  Be prepared
        # by eval'ing and handling any exceptions that occur.

DESCRIPTION
    This class provides a simple abstraction layer between SOAP::Lite and
    Salesforce.com. Because SOAP::Lite does not support complexTypes, and
    document/literal encoding is limited, this module works around those
    limitations and provides a more intuitive interface a developer can
    interact with.

CONSTRUCTORS
  new( HASH )
    Synonym for "login"

  login( HASH )
    The "login" method returns an object of type WWW::Salesforce if the
    login attempt was successful, and 0 otherwise. Upon a successful login,
    the "sessionId" is saved and the serverUrl set properly so that
    developers need not worry about setting these values manually. Upon
    failure, the method dies with an error string.

    The following are the accepted input parameters:

    username
        A Salesforce.com username.

    password
        The password for the user indicated by "username".

METHODS
  convertLead( HASH )
    The "convertLead" method returns an object of type SOAP::SOM if the
    login attempt was successful, and 0 otherwise.

    Converts a Lead into an Account, Contact, or (optionally) an Opportunity

    The following are the accepted input parameters:

    %hash_of_array_references
            leadId => [ 2345, 5678, ],
            contactId => [ 9876, ],

  create( HASH )
    Adds one new individual objects to your organization's data. This takes
    as input a HASH containing the fields (the keys of the hash) and the
    values of the record you wish to add to your organization. The hash must
    contain the 'type' key in order to identify the type of the record to
    add.

    Returns a SOAP::Lite object. Success of this operation can be gleaned
    from the envelope result.

        $r->envelope->{Body}->{createResponse}->{result}->{success};

  delete( ARRAY )
    Deletes one or more individual objects from your organization's data.
    This subroutine takes as input an array of SCALAR values, where each
    SCALAR is an "sObjectId".

  describeGlobal()
    Retrieves a list of available objects for your organization's data. You
    can then iterate through this list and use "describeSObject()" to obtain
    metadata about individual objects. This method calls the Salesforce
    describeGlobal method
    <https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.api.meta/api/sforce_a
    pi_calls_describeglobal.htm>.

  describeLayout( HASH )
    Describes metadata about a given page layout, including layouts for edit
    and display-only views and record type mappings.

    type
        The type of the object you wish to have described.

  describeSObject( HASH )
    Describes metadata (field list and object properties) for the specified
    object.

    type
        The type of the object you wish to have described.

  describeSObjects( type => ['Account','Contact','CustomObject__c'] )
    An array based version of describeSObject; describes metadata (field
    list and object properties) for the specified object or array of
    objects.

  describeTabs()
    Use the "describeTabs" call to obtain information about the standard and
    custom apps to which the logged-in user has access. The "describeTabs"
    call returns the minimum required metadata that can be used to render
    apps in another user interface. Typically this call is used by partner
    applications to render Salesforce data in another user interface.

  get_client( $readable )
    Get a client

  get_session_header()
    Gets the session header

  get_session_id()
    Gets the Salesforce SID

  get_user_id()
    Gets the Salesforce UID

  get_username()
    Gets the Salesforce Username

  getDeleted( HASH )
    Retrieves the list of individual objects that have been deleted within
    the given time span for the specified object.

    type
        Identifies the type of the object you wish to find deletions for.

    start
        A string identifying the start date/time for the query

    end A string identifying the end date/time for the query

  getServerTimestamp()
    Retrieves the current system timestamp (GMT) from the Salesforce web
    service.

  getUpdated( HASH )
    Retrieves the list of individual objects that have been updated (added
    or changed) within the given time span for the specified object.

    type
        Identifies the type of the object you wish to find updates for.

    start
        A string identifying the start date/time for the query

    end A string identifying the end date/time for the query

  getUserInfo( HASH )
    Retrieves personal information for the user associated with the current
    session.

    user
        A user ID

  logout()
    Ends the session for the logged-in user issuing the call. No arguments
    are needed. Useful to avoid hitting the limit of ten open sessions per
    login. Logout API Call
    <http://www.salesforce.com/us/developer/docs/api/Content/sforce_api_call
    s_logout.htm>

  query( HASH )
    Executes a query against the specified object and returns data that
    matches the specified criteria.

    query
        The query string to use for the query. The query string takes the
        form of a *basic* SQL statement. For example, "SELECT Id,Name FROM
        Account".

    limit
        This sets the batch size, or size of the result returned. This is
        helpful in producing paginated results, or fetch small sets of data
        at a time.

  queryAll( HASH )
    Executes a query against the specified object and returns data that
    matches the specified criteria including archived and deleted objects.

    query
        The query string to use for the query. The query string takes the
        form of a *basic* SQL statement. For example, "SELECT Id,Name FROM
        Account".

    limit
        This sets the batch size, or size of the result returned. This is
        helpful in producing paginated results, or fetch small sets of data
        at a time.

  queryMore( HASH )
    Retrieves the next batch of objects from a "query" or "queryAll".

    queryLocator
        The handle or string returned by "query". This identifies the result
        set and cursor for fetching the next set of rows from a result set.

    limit
        This sets the batch size, or size of the result returned. This is
        helpful in producing paginated results, or fetch small sets of data
        at a time.

  resetPassword( HASH )
    Changes a user's password to a server-generated value.

    userId
        A user Id.

  retrieve( HASH )
    fields
        A comma delimited list of field name you want retrieved.

    type
        The type of the object being queried.

    ids The ids (LIST) of the object you want returned.

  search( HASH )
    searchString
        The search string to be used in the query. For example, "find
        {4159017000} in phone fields returning contact(id, phone, firstname,
        lastname), lead(id, phone, firstname, lastname), account(id, phone,
        name)"

  setPassword( HASH )
    Sets the specified user's password to the specified value.

  sf_date
    Converts a time in Epoch seconds to the date format that Salesforce
    likes

  update(type => $type, HASHREF [, HASHREF ...])
    Updates one or more existing objects in your organization's data. This
    subroutine takes as input a type value which names the type of object to
    update (e.g. Account, User) and one or more perl HASH references
    containing the fields (the keys of the hash) and the values of the
    record that will be updated.

    The hash must contain the 'Id' key in order to identify the record to
    update.

  upsert(type => $type, key => $key, HASHREF [, HASHREF ...])
    Updates or inserts one or more objects in your organization's data. If
    the data doesn't exist on Salesforce, it will be inserted. If it already
    exists it will be updated.

    This subroutine takes as input a type value which names the type of
    object to update (e.g. Account, User). It also takes a key value which
    specifies the unique key Salesforce should use to determine if it needs
    to update or insert. If key is not given it will default to 'Id' which
    is Salesforce's own internal unique ID. This key can be any of
    Salesforce's default fields or an custom field marked as an external
    key.

    Finally, this method takes one or more perl HASH references containing
    the fields (the keys of the hash) and the values of the record that will
    be updated.

  get_clientM( $readable )
  get_session_headerM()
  describeMetadata()
    Get some metadata info about your instance.

  retrieveMetadata()
  checkAsyncStatus( $pid )

    useful if ($res->valueof('//success') ne 'true')

      {
          'statusCode' => 'INVALID_FIELD_FOR_INSERT_UPDATE',
          'message' => 'Account: bad field names on insert/update call: type'
          ...
      }

  bye()
    Synonym for "logout".

    Ends the session for the logged-in user issuing the call. No arguments
    are needed. Returns a reference to an array of hash refs

  do_query( $query, [$limit] )
    Returns a reference to an array of hash refs

  do_queryAll( $query, [$limit] )
    Returns a reference to an array of hash refs

  get_field_list( $table_name )
    Returns a ref to an array of hash refs for each field name Field name
    keyed as 'name'

  get_tables()
    Returns a reference to an array of hash references Each hash gives the
    properties for each Salesforce object
