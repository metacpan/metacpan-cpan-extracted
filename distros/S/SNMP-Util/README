  Documentation
  -------------

    User documentation in POD format is contained within the module
    source (i.e. the .pm file).  Installing using "make install"
    places this documentation in a man page in the perl library under
    the directory "man/man3".  There is also html documentation in this
    directory.



  Installation
  ------------

    To install, cd to the directory containing the unpacked
    distribution and do one of the following:

        Create a makefile by running Makefile.PL using the perl
        program into whose library you want to install and then run
        make three times:

            perl Makefile.PL
            make

            *********************************************************************************
            Note: Edit the Util_env.pm file and add the correct mibs before executing make test
            *********************************************************************************

            make test
            make install

        To install into a private library, for example your home
        directory:

            perl Makefile.PL INSTALLSITELIB=$HOME/lib INSTALLMAN3DIR=$HOME/man
            make

            *********************************************************************************
            Note: Edit the Util_env.pm file and add the correct mibs before executing make test
            *********************************************************************************

            make test
            make pure_install

        Alternatively, you can just copy or move Util.pm
        from the distribution into a directory named SNMP/ in the Perl
        library.  You can then manually build the documentation using
        pod2man or pod2html.
