DESCRIPTION
    This dancer plugin gives you access to the products, cart and account
    functions of the Nitesi shop machine.

PRODUCTS
CARTS
    The cart keyword returns a Nitesi::Cart object with the corresponding
    methods.

    You can use multiple carts like that:

        cart('wishlist')->add({sku => 'ABC', name => 'Foobar', quantity => 1, price => 42});
        cart('wishlist')->total;

    The DBI backend (Dancer::Plugin::Nitesi::Cart::DBI) allows you to load
    carts of arbitrary users.

        cart('', 123)->items;

PAYMENT
    Card payments can be processed by one of the various providers supported
    by Business::OnlinePayment with the charge keyword.

        $tx = charge(provider => 'Braintree',
                     amount => cart->total,
                     first_name => 'Test',
                     last_name => 'Tester',
                     card_number => '4111111111111111',
                     expiration => '0714',
                     cvc => '222');

ACCOUNTS
    The account keyword returns a Nitesi::Account::Manager object with the
    corresponding methods.

    Login to an account:

        account->login(username => 'frank@nitesi.com', password => 'nevairbe');

    Logout:

        account->logout();

    Check permissions:

        account->acl(check => 'view_prices');

    Change password for current account:

        account->password('nevairbe');

    Change password for other account:

        account->password(username => 'frank@nitesi.com', password => 'nevairbe');

    Create account:

        account->create(email => 'fina@nitesi.com');

ROUTES
    Standard routes can be registered by including the
    Dancer::Plugin::Nitesi::Routes module and calling `shop_set_routes' at
    the end of your main application module:

        package MyShopApp;

        use Dancer ':syntax';
        use Dancer::Plugin::Nitesi;
        use Dancer::Plugin::Nitesi::Routes;

        ...

        shop_setup_routes;

        1;

CONFIGURATION
    The default configuration is as follows:

        plugins:
          Nitesi:
            Account:
              Session:
                Key: account
              Provider: DBI
            Cart:
              Backend: Session
            Product:
              backend: DBI
              table: products
              key: sku
            Query:
              log: 0

  ACCOUNT
    Connection
    The connection used by Dancer::Plugin::Database can be set as follows:

        plugins:
          Nitesi:
            Account:
              Provider: DBI
              Connection: shop

    Fields
    Extra fields can be retrieved from the account provider and put into the
    session after a successful login:

        plugins:
          Nitesi:
            Account:
              Provider: DBI
              Fields: first_name,last_name,city

  PRODUCTS
    If your products table slightly varies from our default schema in
    Nitesi::Database::Schema, you can adjust this in your configuration:

        plugins:
          Nitesi:
            Product:
              attributes:
                name: description
                short_description: comment_short

    This directs Dancer::Plugin::Nitesi to use the description field instead
    of the name field and the comment_short field instead of the
    short_description field.

  QUERY
    DBI queries can be logged with debug level as follows:

        plugins:
          Nitesi:
            Query:
              log: 1
