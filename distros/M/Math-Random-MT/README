NAME
    Math::Random::MT - The Mersenne Twister PRNG

SYNOPSIS
      ## Object-oriented interface:
      use Math::Random::MT;
      $gen = Math::Random::MT->new()        # or...
      $gen = Math::Random::MT->new($seed);  # or...
      $gen = Math::Random::MT->new(@seeds);
      $seed = $gen->get_seed();             # seed used to generate the random numbers
      $rand = $gen->rand(42);               # random number in the interval [0, 42)
      $dice = int($gen->rand(6)+1);         # random integer between 1 and 6
      $coin = $gen->rand() < 0.5 ?          # flip a coin
        "heads" : "tails"
      $int = $gen->irand();                 # random integer in [0, 2^32-1]

      ## Function-oriented interface:
      use Math::Random::MT qw(srand rand irand);
      # now use srand() and rand() as you usually do in Perl

DESCRIPTION
    The Mersenne Twister is a pseudorandom number generator developed by
    Makoto Matsumoto and Takuji Nishimura. It is described in their paper at
    <URL:http://www.math.keio.ac.jp/~nisimura/random/doc/mt.ps>. This
    algorithm has a very uniform distribution and is good for modelling
    purposes but do not use it for cryptography.

    This module implements two interfaces:

  Object-oriented interface
    new()
        Creates a new generator that is automatically seeded based on
        gettimeofday.

    new($seed)
        Creates a new generator seeded with an unsigned 32-bit integer.

    new(@seeds)
        Creates a new generator seeded with an array of (up to 624) unsigned
        32-bit integers.

    set_seed()
        Seeds the generator. It takes the same arguments as *new()*.

    get_seed()
        Retrieves the value of the seed used.

    rand($num)
        Behaves exactly like Perl's builtin rand(), returning a number
        uniformly distributed in [0, $num) ($num defaults to 1).

    irand()
        Returns a 32-bit integer, i.e. an integer uniformly distributed in
        [0, 2^32-1].

  Function-oriented interface
    srand($seed)
        Behaves just like Perl's builtin srand(). As in Perl >= 5.14, the
        seed is returned. If you use this interface, it is strongly
        recommended that you call *srand()* explicitly, rather than relying
        on *rand()* to call it the first time it is used.

    rand($num)
        Behaves exactly like Perl's builtin rand(), returning a number
        uniformly distributed in [0, $num) ($num defaults to 1).

    irand()
        Returns a 32-bit integer, i.e. an integer uniformly distributed in
        [0, 2^32-1].
