App-TimelogTxt version 0.12

This is a modulized version of a script I've been using for the last few years
to track my time spent on various projects at home and at work. It is based
loosely on two other projects.

For well over a decade I used the program TEAK on Palm OS to track this
information. Now that Palm is defunct, I needed something else. I've also been
using Gina Trapani's Todo.txt tools to track my todo list. Her simple text file
based design solved the biggest problem I had with the time logging software.

So the original timelog script was born. This program is the result of a few
years of refining that design.

In addition to the text-based format, I also stole the concept of configuration
based aliases from git. This turns out to make the timelog tool much more
useful.
