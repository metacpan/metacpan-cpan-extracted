-----------------------------------------------
Eeek - 1.2 didn't compile. Stupid Simon.



Mon Jun 21 09:54:46 BST 2004    v1.2
-----------------------------------------------
Patch from Simon Cozens which should make things
slightly saner if it can't find all the necessary
hidden dictionary files.



Sat Jun 19 18:21:17 BST 2004    v1.01
-----------------------------------------------
Well, it would have been the last release if I hadn't
been a muppet and forgotten an 's' and something out
of the MANIFEST.




Thu Jun 17 19:17:49 BST 2004 	v1.0
-----------------------------------------------
First release. Unlikely to need another, I hope.
