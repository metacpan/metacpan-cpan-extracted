NAME

    Test::Script - Basic cross-platform tests for scripts

VERSION

    version 1.18

SYNOPSIS

     use Test::More tests => 2;
     use Test::Script;
     
     script_compiles('script/myscript.pl');
     script_runs(['script/myscript.pl', '--my-argument']);

DESCRIPTION

    The intent of this module is to provide a series of basic tests for 80%
    of the testing you will need to do for scripts in the script (or bin as
    is also commonly used) paths of your Perl distribution.

    Further, it aims to provide this functionality with perfect
    platform-compatibility, and in a way that is as unobtrusive as
    possible.

    That is, if the program works on a platform, then Test::Script should
    always work on that platform as well. Anything less than 100% is
    considered unacceptable.

    In doing so, it is hoped that Test::Script can become a module that you
    can safely make a dependency of all your modules, without risking that
    your module won't on some platform because of the dependency.

    Where a clash exists between wanting more functionality and maintaining
    platform safety, this module will err on the side of platform safety.

FUNCTIONS

 script_compiles

     script_compiles( $script, $test_name );

    The "script_compiles" test calls the script with "perl -c script.pl",
    and checks that it returns without error.

    The path it should be passed is a relative unix-format script name.
    This will be localised when running perl -c and if the test fails the
    local name used will be shown in the diagnostic output.

    Note also that the test will be run with the same perl interpreter that
    is running the test script (and not with the default system perl). This
    will also be shown in the diagnostic output on failure.

 script_runs

     script_runs( $script, $test_name );
     script_runs( \@script_and_arguments, $test_name );
     script_runs( $script, \%options, $test_name );
     script_runs( \@script_and_arguments, \%options, $test_name );

    The "script_runs" test executes the script with "perl script.pl" and
    checks that it returns success.

    The path it should be passed is a relative unix-format script name.
    This will be localised when running perl -c and if the test fails the
    local name used will be shown in the diagnostic output.

    The test will be run with the same perl interpreter that is running the
    test script (and not with the default system perl). This will also be
    shown in the diagnostic output on failure.

    You may pass in options as a hash as the second argument.

    exit

      The expected exit value. The default is to use whatever indicates
      success on your platform (usually 0).

    signal

      The expected signal. The default is 0. Use with care! This may not be
      portable, and is known not to work on Windows.

    stdin

      The input to be passed into the script via stdin. The value may be
      one of

      simple scalar

	Is considered to be a filename.

      scalar reference

	In which case the input will be drawn from the data contained in
	the referenced scalar.

      The behavior for any other types is undefined (the current
      implementation uses IPC::Run3, but that may change in the future).

    stdout

      Where to send the standard output to. If you use this option, then
      the the behavior of the script_stdout_ functions below are undefined.
      The value may be one of

      simple scalar

	Is considered to be a filename.

      scalar reference

      In which case the standard output will be places into the referenced
      scalar

      The behavior for any other types is undefined (the current
      implementation uses IPC::Run3, but that may change in the future).

    stderr

      Same as stdout above, except for stderr.

 script_stdout_is

     script_stdout_is $expected_stdout, $test_name;

    Tests if the output to stdout from the previous "script_runs" matches
    the expected value exactly.

 script_stdout_isnt

     script_stdout_is $expected_stdout, $test_name;

    Tests if the output to stdout from the previous "script_runs" does NOT
    match the expected value exactly.

 script_stdout_like

     script_stdout_like $regex, $test_name;

    Tests if the output to stdout from the previous "script_runs" matches
    the regular expression.

 script_stdout_unlike

     script_stdout_unlike $regex, $test_name;

    Tests if the output to stdout from the previous "script_runs" does NOT
    match the regular expression.

 script_stderr_is

     script_stderr_is $expected_stderr, $test_name;

    Tests if the output to stderr from the previous "script_runs" matches
    the expected value exactly.

 script_stderr_isnt

     script_stderr_is $expected_stderr, $test_name;

    Tests if the output to stderr from the previous "script_runs" does NOT
    match the expected value exactly.

 script_stderr_like

     script_stderr_like $regex, $test_name;

    Tests if the output to stderr from the previous "script_runs" matches
    the regular expression.

 script_stderr_unlike

     script_stderr_unlike $regex, $test_name;

    Tests if the output to stderr from the previous "script_runs" does NOT
    match the regular expression.

CAVEATS

    This module is fully supported back to Perl 5.8.1. It may work on
    5.8.0. It should work on Perl 5.6.x and I may even test on 5.6.2. I
    will accept patches to maintain compatibility for such older Perls, but
    you may need to fix it on 5.6.x / 5.8.0 and send me a patch.

    This module uses IPC::Run3 to compile and run scripts. There are a
    number of outstanding issues with this module, and maintenance for
    IPC::Run3 is not swift. One of these is that IPC::Run3 incorrectly
    throws an exception on Windows when you feed it a Perl script with a
    compile error. Currently Test::Script probes for this bug (it checks
    for the bug, not for a specific version) and applies a workaround in
    that case. I am hoping to remove the work around once the bug is fixed
    in IPC::Run3.
