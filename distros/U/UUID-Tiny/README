UUID-Tiny Version 1.04

This is a Pure Perl module for the creation of UUIDs:

- version 1 time based (with random multicast MAC address)
- version 3 MD5 based
- version 4 random number based
- version 5 SHA-1 based

The module uses a functional interface and creates binary (network byte order)
or string representations. Version 3 and 5 UUIDs can be created from file
content instead of "names" (strings).

Be aware that, because of being a Pure Perl implementation, there are
performance limits and the randomness of multicast MAC addresses and the
version 4 numbers are not perfect. If you can afford module compilation and
installation, you should look at Data::UUID instead!
