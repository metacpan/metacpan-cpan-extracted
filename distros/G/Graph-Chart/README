  overlay
            method to put an overlay on top of the graph ( to show alarm period ... )

      use the same parameter as the new()
      if the same layer is already present, overwrite this layer

  overlay
            method to put a glyph on the graph ( to show the latest data polled, or a trend value, ... )

      use the same parameter as the new()
      if the same layer is already present, overwrite this layer

  png_zEXt
            method to add a png data TAG 
            This tag is not a PNG standard, but allowed by the RFC
            see code in img_info.pl 
        
            my $png_out1 =$graph->png_zEXt( { eerer => 1, ggg => 'zed' } );
            this overwrite the png TAG data with the new value and return the new image

  render
            render the chart and return a png image

      my $img = $graph->render( \%tag )
   
      the hash ref contain data to put in the PNG meta tag.
      the tools img_info.pl allow to see the result.
      the tag is serialized in the png
  
      the returned value could be writted in a file like this:
      my $png_out = $graph->render();
  
        open( my $IMG, '>', $file ) or die $!;
        binmode $IMG;
        print $IMG $png_out;
        close $IMG;
    );

COLOR format
      the color could be in the form of html hexa value '0xff00ff' of simple the hexa value 'ff00ff' all must be read as a string 0xff0000 = 16711680
      it is also possible to use an array with multiple color to create a 'gdDtyled' color ( see GP.pm doc )
      example:
      color => [
            '0xff0000',
            '0xff0000',
            '0xff0000',
            '0xff0000',
            '0x00ff00',
            '0x00ff00',
            '0x00ff00',
            'gdTransparent',
            'gdTransparent'
            ],
