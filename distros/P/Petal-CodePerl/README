NAME
    Petal::CodePerl - Make Petal go faster by compiling the expressions

SYNOPSIS
      use Petal::CodePerl;

      # continue as you would normally using Petal

    or

      use Petal;
      $Petal::CodeGenerator = 'Petal::CodePerl::CodeGenerator';
      
  # continue as you would normally use Petal

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides a CodeGenerator for Petal that inherits almost
    everything from Petal::CodeGenerator but modifies how expressions are dealt
    with. Petal normally includes code like this

      $hash->get( "not:user" )

    in the compiled template. This means the path has to be parsed and
    interpreted at runtime. Using Petal::CodePerl, Petal will now produce this

      ! ($hash->{"user"})

    which will be much faster.

    It uses Parse::RecDescent to parse the PETALES expressions which makes it a
    bit slow to load the module but this won't matter much unless you have
    turned off caching. It won't matter at all for something like Apache's
    mod_perl.

USAGE
    You have two choices, you can replace "use Petal" with "use Petal::CodePerl"
    in all your scripts or you can do "$Petal::CodeGenerator =
    'Petal::CodePerl::CodeGenerator'". Either of these will cause Petal to use
    the expression compiling version of the CodeGenerator.

EXTRA BONUSES
    Using Parse::RecDescent makes it easier to expand the PETALES grammar. I
    have made the following enhancements.

    * alternators work as in TAL, so you can do

        petal:content="a/name|b/name|string:no name"

    * you can explicitly ask for hash, array or method in a path

      * user{name} is $hash->{"user"}->{"name"}

      * user[1] is $hash->{"user"}->[1]

      * user/method() is $hash->{"user"}->method()

        using these will make your template even faster although you need to be
        certain of your data types.

    * method arguments can be any expression for example

        user/purchase cookie{basket}
        
will give

        $hash->{"user"}->purchase($hash->{"cookie"}->{"basket"})

    * you can do more complex defines, like the following

        petal:define="a{b}[1] string:hello"

      which will give

        $hash->{"a"}->[1] = "hello"

    * some other stuff that I can't remember just now.

MODIFIERS
    Modifiers can now be compiled, partially compiled or work exactly as they
    did before. When compiling the expression, Petal::CodePerl will look at the
    modifier's package to figure what it supports. The order of preference is
    fully compiled, partially compiled, original style. So you can slowly
    migrate you modifiers to full compilation.

    Note that although original style still works, you cannot use any of the
    extra features of Petal::CodePerl in the path if you are using an original
    modifier. So you cannot do mymod:hash{key} until you convert your modifier
    into one of the newer styles. This is because your original style modifier
    uses Petal's parser and Petal's parser doesn't accept the {} syntax. It
    would probably be possible to fix this too but I don't think it's worth it.
    If you really need it, let me know.

  Partially Compiled
    Partially compiled modifiers are easiest, in fact they are even easier than
    Petal's original style. To partially compile a modifier, define a package
    with a "process_value()" method, and put that into %Petal::Hash::MODIFIERS
    just as you would with a normal modifier package.

    A simple example

      package Petal::Hash::Length;
      $Petal::Hash::MODIFIERS{"length:"} = "Petal::Hash::Length";

      sub process_value
      {
        my $class = shift;
        my $hash = shift;
        my $value = shift;

       return length($value);
      }

    This is a little different to the "process()" method originally used for
    modifiers. For a path like true:this/is/a/path, Petal would call "process()"
    with 2 arguments - the Petal hash and the string "this/is/a/path", it was
    then up to the method to parse that string and find the value that it
    pointed to. For "process_value()", this string has already been parsed and
    compiled, so the value defined by the path is passed in and can be used
    straight away.

  Fully Compiled
    The most efficient but a little more complicated is fully compiled. For a
    fully compiled modifier you need to have an "inline()" method which will
    return a Code::Perl object that will produce the compiled code. It's not a
    hard as it sounds. There is an easy to use Code::Perl object provided that
    makes this fairly straight-forward. Here's the example above rewritten as a
    fully compiled modifier.

      package Petal::Hash::Length;
      $Petal::Hash::MODIFIERS{"length:"} = "Petal::Hash::Length";

      use Petal::CodePerl::Expr qw( perlsprintf );

      sub inline
      {
        my $class = shift;
        my $hash_obj = shift;
        my $value_obj = shift;

        return perlsprintf("length(%s)", $value_obj);
      }

    The key points to note are that instead of getting the Petal hash and the
    value of the expression you are modifying, you get Code::Perl objects
    representing them, you then use these objects to construct another
    Code::Perl object which will eventually spit out the Perl code for your
    modifier. It's not in the example above but if your modifier wants to access
    the Petal hash please don't write '$hash->{blah}', instead write
    '%s->{blah}' and pass in the $hash_obj object. This allows for the
    possibility in the future that the hash is not called '$hash'.

    Why not just use simple strings? Because using Code::Perl objects instead of
    strings of Perl everywhere means you don't have to worry about escaping and
    wrapping things in ()s and it means that modifiers can be inside modifiers,
    deep inside complicated Petales expressions, which themselves are inside a
    modifier etc, etc.

  Tips for writing modifiers
    The easiest way to write a compiled modifier is to write a partially
    compiled one first and when you have that working perfectly, you can turn it
    into a fully compiled one. If at any stage you need to go back to using the
    partially compiled one, rather than commenting out the "inline()" method you
    can set "$Petal::CodePerl::InlineMod = 0" and no "inline()" methods routines
    will be used.

    If you are going to use the $value_obj more than once in a compiled modifier
    then you need to be a little bit careful as you only want to calculate the
    value once. Say you have a modifier that takes a string and doubles it, you
    could do this

      perlsprintf("%s.%s", $value_obj, $value_obj);

    but then double:thing/method() would be compiled to

      ($hash->{thing}->method()).($hash->{thing}->method())

    which is bad news because it's inefficient to call the method twice and
    there's no guarantee that the method will actually return the same value for
    each call. So what you should really do is

      perlsprintf("do{my $v = %s; $v.$v}", $value_obj);

    giving

      do{my $v = ($hash->{thing}->method()); $v.$v}

    which is efficient and safe.

  Original
    Any modifiers that are defined in the original Petal style, using a
    "process()" method will not be compiled and so will still work as before.

STATUS
    Petal::CodePerl is in development. There are no known bugs and Petal passes
    it's full test suite using this code generator. However there are probably
    some differences between it's grammar and Petal's current grammar. Please
    let me know if you find anything that works differently with
    Petal::CodePerl.

PROBLEMS
    Your templates may now generate "undefined value" warnings if you try to use
    an undefined value. Previously, Petal prevented many of these from
    occurring. As always, the best thing to do is not to avoid using undefined
    values in your templates. Hopefully this will be fixed shortly.
