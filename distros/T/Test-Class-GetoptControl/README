NAME
    Test::Class::GetoptControl - Command-line control of test class
    execution

VERSION
    version 1.100860

SYNOPSIS
        package MyApp;
        use base qw(Test::Class::GetoptControl);

        package main;
        my $app = MyApp->new;
        $app->runtests;

    on the command-line:

        $ myapp --include FooTests --shuffle
        # test order: shuffle
        ok 1 - foobar

DESCRIPTION
    When inheriting from this class, your application gets the ability to
    control the execution of test classes using command-line options.

METHODS
  runtests
    Calls "get_classes()" to determine which test classes to run and in
    which order, then runs them.

  get_classes
    Asks Test::Class for information on all registered test classes, then
    filters and sorts them by the criteria set in the command-line options.

  GETOPT
    Defines the specific command-line options for this class; see
    Getopt::Inherited.

COMMAND-LINE OPTIONS
    "--include"
        This option takes a string and can be given several times. It says
        that only classes whose package name contains the string should be
        run. "-i" is an alias for this option. If no "include" option is
        given, all test classes are run.

        Examples:

            $ myapp --include Foo
            $ myapp -i Foo
            $ myapp --include Foo --include Bar

    "--shuffle"
        This options causes the test classes to be run in a random order. A
        note saying so is printed as well.

    "--reverse"
        This options causes the test classes to be run in reverse
        alphabetical package name order. If neither "--reverse" nor
        "--shuffle" are given, tests are run in alphabetical package name
        order. If both "--reverse" and "--shuffle" are given, "--shuffle"
        takes precedence and a note saying so is printed.

        In any case, a note specifying the sort order is printed.
