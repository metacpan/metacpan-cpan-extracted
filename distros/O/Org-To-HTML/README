DESCRIPTION
    Export Org format to HTML. To customize, you can subclass this module.

    A command-line utility org-to-html is available in the distribution
    App::OrgUtils.

    Note that this module is just a simple exporter, for "serious" works
    you'll probably want to use the exporting features or org-mode
    <http://orgmode.org>.

new(%args)
  $exp->export_document($doc) => HTML
    Export document to HTML.

FUNCTIONS
  org_to_html
    Usage:

     org_to_html(%args) -> [status, msg, payload, meta]

    Export Org document to HTML.

    This is the non-OO interface. For more customization, consider
    subclassing Org::To::HTML.

    This function is not exported by default, but exportable.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   css_url => *str*

        Add a link to CSS document.

    *   exclude_tags => *array[str]*

        Exclude trees that carry one of these tags.

        If the whole document doesn't have any of these tags, then the whole
        document will be exported. Otherwise, trees that do not carry one of
        these tags will be excluded. If a selected tree is a subtree, the
        heading hierarchy above it will also be selected for export, but not
        the text below those headings.

        exclude_tags is evaluated after include_tags.

    *   html_title => *str*

        HTML document title, defaults to source_file.

    *   ignore_unknown_settings => *bool*

    *   include_tags => *array[str]*

        Include trees that carry one of these tags.

        Works like Org's 'org-export-select-tags' variable. If the whole
        document doesn't have any of these tags, then the whole document
        will be exported. Otherwise, trees that do not carry one of these
        tags will be excluded. If a selected tree is a subtree, the heading
        hierarchy above it will also be selected for export, but not the
        text below those headings.

    *   inline_images => *bool* (default: 1)

        If set to true, will make link to an image filename into an <img>
        element instead of <a>.

    *   naked => *bool*

        Don't wrap exported HTML with HTML/HEAD/BODY elements.

    *   source_file => *str*

        Source Org file to export.

    *   source_str => *str*

        Alternatively you can specify Org string directly.

    *   target_file => *str*

        HTML file to write to.

        If not specified, HTML string will be returned.

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element (status) is an integer containing HTTP status code (200
    means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second element (msg) is
    a string containing error message, or 'OK' if status is 200. Third
    element (payload) is optional, the actual result. Fourth element (meta)
    is called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information.

    Return value: (any)

ATTRIBUTES
  naked => BOOL
    If set to true, export_document() will not output HTML/HEAD/BODY
    wrapping element. Default is false.

  html_title => STR
    Title to use in TITLE element. If unset, defaults to "(no title)" when
    exporting.

  css_url => STR
    If set, export_document() will output a LINK element pointing to this
    CSS.
