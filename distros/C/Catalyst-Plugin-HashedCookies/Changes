        - Added a test for the new _hashedcookies_* check code

        - Silly typo in POD, but was worth correcting to avoid confusion

        - Refactored _hashedcookies_* check code because it was very broken
        - Test support App scrubbed in favour of smarter, simpler alternative

        - Moved POD to the bottom of HashedCookies.pm
        - Updated License and Copyright

        - Lots of tweaks to the POD; a few bugs and a few clarifications.
        - Small fixup to config parameter checking code.
        - Ran the source through perltidy.
        - Refactored the implementation of my Catalyst::Request extensions, so
          that (hopefully) cpan2rpm and the PAUSE indexer don't think I'm
          working on that module.
        - setup() now die()s rather than croak()s.
        - finalize_cookies() now sets $c->error rather than die()ing.
        - Changed dependencies to omit those in Perl core
        - Added 133 tests.
          "Code has bugs. Tests are code. Ergo tests have bugs."
          Please report any broken tests via rt.cpan.org
