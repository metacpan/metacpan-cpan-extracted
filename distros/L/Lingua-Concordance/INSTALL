INSTALL

Installing this module should be trivial since it requires no
dependencies:

  $ perl Makefile.PL
  $ make
  $ make test
  $ make install

Once installed, you should be able to use the concordance.pl script
found in the bin directory. Sample data -- walden.txt -- is found in the
etc directory. Try searching for human. For example:

  $ bin/concordance.pl etc/walden.txt human
