3.08
- webscrape.t still failed on Strawberry Perl if LANG=ru_RU.utf8 - fix

3.07
- webscrape.t fails if LANG=ru_RU.utf8 - fix

3.06
- webscrape.t "top" and "retr" tests failing on some arch: use "is" to
  get actual output from CPAN Testers network.

3.05
Put testp3.pl into scripts - useful POP3-talking test script.
- Change dependency on Email::Stuffer to Email::MIME in conf/jobserve.conf
  and t/webscrape.t - far fewer dependencies, better fit for requirement.
- New scripts/ entry - mailbox-test, which exercises a mailbox class from
  a given conf file.
- New scripts/ entry - webscrape, which exercises *::webscrape from a
  given conf file, allowing development/testing of that class.

3.04
- Use another tmpdir instead of "out" in t/testcommon.pl's server config
  so an "out" directory is not left in the source directory after tests.
- Rename *::Folder::virtual::jobserve to *::Folder::webscrape
- make t/webscrape.t

3.03 2013/12/31
- Moved tests to t/*.t. Changes for Win32: if Win32, don't install SIGUSR1
  handler, don't try to use IO::Select->can_read, don't call getgrnam

3.02 2013/12/28
- Updated tests to reduce duplication and hardcoding.

3.01 2013/12/27
- To make it pass tests (and actually build), stopped using ".inst_dir"
  in distrib directory to build the scripts, since it was not being created
  and therefore was causing immediate failure. Instead used hardcoded value.

3.0 (from 2.* by Mark Tiramani) 2002/08/09
- Turned Mail::POP3Server into Mail::POP3 - redesigned it to be as follows:
  - Mail::POP3::Daemon does the socket-accepting.
  - Mail::POP3::Server does (most of) the network POP3 stuff.
  - Mail::POP3::Security::{User,Connection} do the checks on users and connections.
  - Mail::POP3::Folder::* classes handles the mail folders.
  - Mail::POP3::Folder::virtual::jobserve presents a jobserve search
    (using the username as params) as a POP3 mailbox.

- This involved turning the previous Mail::POP3Server "inside out", since
  it more or less only had as an interface a "startserver" method.
