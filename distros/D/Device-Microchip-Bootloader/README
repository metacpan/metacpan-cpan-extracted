NAME
    Device::Microchip::Bootloader - Bootloader host software for Microchip
    PIC devices

VERSION
    version 0.7

SYNOPSIS
    my $loader = Device::Microchip::Bootloader->new(firmware =>
    'my_firmware.hex', target => '/dev/ttyUSB0');

DESCRIPTION
    Host software for bootloading a HEX file to a PIC microcontroller that
    is programmed with the bootloader as described in Microchip AN1310.

    The tool allows bootloading over serial port and over ethernet when the
    device is connected over a serial to ethernet adapter such as a
    Lantronix XPort.

METHODS
  "new(%parameters)"
    This constructor returns a new Device::Microchip::Bootloader object.
    Supported parameters are listed below

    firmware
        The hex file that is to be programmed into the target device. Upon
        creation of the object, the HEX file will be examined and possible
        errors will be flagged.

    device
        The target device where to send the firmware to. This can be either
        a serial port object (e.g. /dev/ttyUSB0) or a TCP socket (e.g.
        192.168.1.52:10001).

    baudrate
        Optional parameter when using a serial port for connecting to the
        bootloader. Default value is 115200 bps.

    verbose
        Controls the verbosity of the module. Defaults to 0. Increasing
        numbers make the module more chatty. 5 is the highest level and
        probably provides too much information. 3 is a good level to get
        started.

  "connect_target"
    Make a connection to the target device. This function will return a hash
    containing information on the response containing the following
    elements:

    firmware version
    type of PIC we're connected to ('PIC16' of 'PIC18')

  "bootloader_version"
    Reports the version of the bootloader firmware running on the device as
    [major].[minor].

  "launch_app"
    Exit the bootloader and launch the application code.

  "erase_flash($stop_address, $pages)"
    This function erases flash pages. The $stop_address is the base address
    of the last page to erase. $pages specifies how many pages will be
    erased. The erasing happend backwards (from the page defined by
    $stop_address) to lower addresses. See the Microchip application note
    AN1310 for details.

    Warning: this function will erase the 'goto bootloader' instruction at
    address 0x0000 too, so ensure to save it before erasing the first page
    in program memory of the tager device.

  "read_eeprom($start_address, $nr_of_bytes)"
    Reads a number of bytes from the EEPROM of the device. Returns '05' when
    no EEPROM is present in the device.

  "read_flash($start_address, $nr_of_bytes)"
    Reads a number of bytes from the flash memory (= program memory) of the
    target device.

  "read_flash_crc($start_address, $nr_of_write_blocks)"
    Read the CRC values of $nr_of_write_blocks flash write blocks (=
    typically a smaller value than the blocksize of a flash erase block, see
    the specs of your target device for details).

  "write_flash($start_adress, $data)"
    Writes the $data to the program memory starting from location
    $start_address. $start_address should be aligned with the write block
    size and $data is an ASCII string in hexacdecimal format where a single
    byte is a readable nibble. So e.g. "10" represents a byte value of 0x10.
    The first byte of the $data string will be written at $start_address and
    the address is incremented from that point on.

  "BUILD"
    An internal function used by Moose to run code after the constructor.
    Need to document because otherwise Test::Pod::Coverage test fails

  "O_NDELAY"
    Detected by Pod::Coverage from the sysopen function. Stub documenation
    to ensure the test does not fail when the module is deployed.

  "O_NOCTTY"
    Detected by Pod::Coverage from the sysopen function. Stub documenation
    to ensure the test does not fail when the module is deployed.

  "O_RDWR"
    Detected by Pod::Coverage from the sysopen function. Stub documenation
    to ensure the test does not fail when the module is deployed.
