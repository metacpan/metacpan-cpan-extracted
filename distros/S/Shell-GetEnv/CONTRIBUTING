there's something that you think could improve the workflow, please let us know.



What to Contribute?
===================

Very welcome:

* Documentation
* Tests
* New functionality
* Typos.
* Fixing bugs

Things that might take some convincing:

* Functionality that's too far from the core purpose of
  this code
* Invasive changes to make things work with older versions of Perl
  (non-invasive changes are welcome!)


Where's the Code?
=================

The primary repository for this code is on BitBucket:

>  [https://bitbucket.org/djerius/Shell-GetEnv]()

Contribution Guidelines
=======================

* Courtesy is always rewarded. Courtesy is expected from contributers
  and project members.

* Code should be as cross platform as possible. Please use core
  facilities whenever possible, unless the project already uses a
  non-core module which provides better interface or functionality

* Add only necessary dependencies.

* Please communicate via the request tracker prior to making major changes.  There may be
  competing interests that need to be accomodated.

* Keep commits small and targeted.  It is much easier to review and
  understand them.

* Add tests.
