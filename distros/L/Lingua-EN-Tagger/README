Lingua::EN::Tagger 

This module uses part-of-speech statistics from the Penn Treebank
to assign POS tags to English text. The tagger applies a bigram (two-word)
Hidden Markov Model to guess the appropriate POS tag for a word.  That means
that the tagger will try to assign a POS tag based on the known POS tags
for a given word and the POS tag assigned to its predecessor.

The tagger tends to assume unknown words are nouns, but this behavior is 
configurable.

The POS tagger can also be used to find maximal noun phrases in tagged text.  
You can also use this module to extract all nouns and/or noun phrases.



TAG SET

----------------------------------------------------------------
The set of POS tags used here is a modified version of the
Penn Treebank tagset. Tags with non-letter characters have been 
redefined to work better in our data structures. Also, the 
``Determiner'' tag (DET) has been changed from `DT', in order to
avoid confusion with the HTML tag, <DT>.
