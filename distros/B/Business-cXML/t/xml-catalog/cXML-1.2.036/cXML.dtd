    Common to most variants of the PunchOut transaction set.  Defined here
    to be easily shared between multiple DTD files without requiring
    inclusion of Transaction.mod in all of them.

    All of the PunchOut transaction sets include an originating Request
    (ProviderSetupRequest for example), relatively simple Response
    (PunchOutSetupResponse for example) and final Message
    (ProviderDoneMessage or PunchOutOrderMessage).  The Request and
    Response comprise a back-end transaction between two cooperating
    applications that wish to extend an interactive session from one to the
    other.  The Request provides the destination application with
    authentication, identification and other setup information.  The
    Response provides the originating application with a unique starting
    location for the interactive (HTML) session at the destination system.

    After receiving a Response of this type, the originating application
    redirects the user's browser to the provided location.  (For some
    non-HTML applications, opening a new browser window at that location
    may be more appropriate.)  The destination system eventually provides
    an HTML form to the user's browser.  This form submits the final
    Message to close the remote session, return that user to the
    originating application and carry any required information back to the
    originating application.

    OriginatorCookie - Identification of a specific PunchOut session.  Used

<!--
    Defines details of one type of tax.

    TaxableAmount
       The taxable amount.

    TaxAmount
       The tax amount.

    TaxLocation
       The tax location.

    Description
       The textual description of the current type of tax.

    TriangularTransactionLawReference
       The law reference for transactions where isTriangularTransaction is True

    purpose
       The purpose of the tax, e.g., tax (tax), custom duty, shippingTax,
       specialHandlingTax, etc.

    category
       The tax category, Sales tax (sales), Use tax (usage), VAT (vat),
       GST (gst) are defined categories. Other values are permitted.

    percentageRate
       The tax rate in number of percentage.

    isVatRecoverable
       True if the VAT is recoverable.  Default is false.

    taxPointDate
       refers to the date on which VAT becomes due.

    paymentDate
       indicate the date when payment must be made.

    isTriangularTransaction
       True if the transaction is triangular.  Default is false.

    exemptDetail
       If the TaxAmount is zero, VAT or other regulations may require
       a reason why.  zeroRated means the tax rate is zero.  exempt
       means the item or items are exempt from taxation.
	   
	taxRateType
	   Specify the tax rate type code(a string) that corresponds to a specific tax type. 
 	   For example, in Germany the tax rate of 19% for value-added tax (VAT) corresponds to the “Standard” tax rate type. 
 	   In different EU member states, different VAT rates are allowed. 
 	   The tax rate type makes it easy for the back-end system to handle different rates that result from changes in tax law.

    basePercentageRate
       The base tax rate in number of percentage.
       For some Tax categories (eg, ICMS for Brazil) TaxAmount will be calculated
       considering the basePercentageRate along with percentageRate.
       TaxAmount = TaxableAmount * percentageRate * basePercentageRate
       Used only in the Quote Messages.

    isIncludedInPrice

-->
<!ELEMENT SupplierBatchID (#PCDATA)>


<!--
    How the supplier identifies an item they sell.

    If SupplierPartID does not provide a unique key to identify the item,
    then the supplier should generate a key which identifies the part
    uniquely when combined with the SupplierID and SupplierPartID. The
    key is called SupplierPartAuxiliaryID.


    An example is where a Supplier would use the same PartID for an
    item but have a different price for units of "EA" versus "BOX".
    In this case, the ItemIDs should be:
    <ItemID>
        <SupplierPartID>pn12345</SupplierPartID>
        <SupplierPartAuxiliaryID>EA</SupplierPartAuxiliaryID>
    </ItemID>
    <ItemID>
        <SupplierPartID>pn12345</SupplierPartID>
        <SupplierPartAuxiliaryID>
           <foo>well formed XML here</foo>
        </SupplierPartAuxiliaryID>
    </ItemID>
    In this case, the "foo" element must be defined in an internal subset
    sent with the cXML document.  Otherwise, parsers will not be able to
    validate that document.

    In a preferred approach, the sending application may escape the contained
    XML using CDATA sections.  This would appear as:
       ...
       <SupplierPartAuxiliaryID>
           <![CDATA[<foo>well formed XML here</foo>]]>
       </SupplierPartAuxiliaryID>
       ...

    Finally, the angle brackets could be escaped using XML character
    entities.  This might be a bit harder for humans to read.  For example:
       ...
       <SupplierPartAuxiliaryID>
           &lt;foo&gt;well formed XML here&lt;/foo&gt;
       </SupplierPartAuxiliaryID>
       ...

    revisionID     
       Also known as Material Revision Level. "Revision" is the most widely-used
       term for referring to that attribute which distinguishes one closely-
       related design iteration from another. A revision represents a change to
       an object, or a modification to a part such that the part remains
       interchangeable with its previous iteration.
       As part of engineering change management the supplier uses the revision
       level to uniquely identify the version of a product, of an article or of
       a part.

    How the shipment will travel on this segment.  Each carrier within a
    segment controlled by a third party logistics provider provides
    tracking information to that provider externally.  The
    ShipNoticeRequest includes tracking information at the ShipControl
    level only.

    One Route element may describe only a single mode of travel.  If
    described at all, each mode of a multi-modal route must be described by
    a separate Route element.  It is not necessary to describe every leg of
    the journey to the buyer's ShipTo location.

    The only Contact roles likely to be sensible in this element are
    "carrierCorporate" (details the contact information the supplier has
    about the carrier organization), "shipFrom" and "shipTo".  The
    "carrierCorporate" role would be relevant at this level only when a
    third party is providing tracking information across multiple carriers.
    A Contact element with role "shipFrom" must appear in all Route
    elements after the first.  Route elements are not required to describe
    the entire travel under a specific carrier's control.  They may
    describe a discontinuous stream of events, starting and ending at
    different times and locations.

    Elements in the Contact list may appear in any order.  A contact role
    (Contact@role attribute value) must not appear more than once within a
    Route element.

    method
        Qualifier identifying the transportation type code:
		- ship: transportation by boat (ocean).
		- rail: transportation by rail
		- motor: transportation by land motor craft (common carrier)
		- air: transportation by flight
		- mail: This code is provided for practical reasons, despite the
			fact that mail is not a genuine mode of transport. In many
			countries, the value of merchandise exported and imported
			by mail is considerable, but the exporter or importer concerned
			would be unable to state by which mode postal items had passed
			the national border
		- multimodal: This code is provided for practical reasons, despite
			the fact that multimodal transport is not a genuine mode of
			transport. It can be used when goods are carried by at least
			two different modes from a place at which the goods are taken
			in charge by a transport operator to a place designated for
			delivery, on the basis of one transport contract. (Operations
			of pick-up and delivery of goods carried out in the performance
			of a unimodal transport, as defined in such a contract, shall
			not be considered as multimodal transport.)
		- fixedTransport: This code applies to installations for continuous
			transport such as pipelines, ropeways and electric power lines.
		- inlandWater: This code is used only in such cases where the
			application of waterborne transport is reported separately
			than maritime transport.
		- unknown: This code can be used when the mode is not known or when
			information on it is not available at the time of issuing the
			document concerned.
		- custom: This code can be used whenever a custom code is used for
			the method. You can put the actual custom code as a text child
			this element.

		IATA (International Air Transport Association) publication Standard Schedules
		Information Manual (SSIM) under the section "ATA/IATA Aircraft Types". The
		referenced codes cover all aircraft that are flown, or are soon to be flown,
		for commercial scheduled or chartered services only, or have been announced
		by the manufacturer and for which airline orders have been placed.

		When the value of method is "multimodal": as this includes multiple segments,
		each of which may have different mode and means, the only possible value
		for means is "unknown".
		
		When the value of method is "fixedTransport", the possible values of means are:
		- unknown: Fixed transport installation of unknown type.
		- pipeline: A line of one or more pipes for continuous transport of
				liquid or gas commodity.
		- powerline: A line of one or more cables or wires for continuous
				transport of electricity.
				
		When the value of method is "inlandWater", the possible values of means are:
		- unknownVessel: Vessel of unknown type.
		- motorFreighter: Motorized vessel designed for carrying general cargo.
		- motorTanker: Motorized vessel designed for carrying liquid cargo.
		- containerVessel: Vessel designed for carrying containers.
		- gasTanker: Vessel with tanks designed for carrying gas
		- tug: Vessel designed to push or pull another vessel.
		- barge: Lighter designed for carrying general cargo.
		- pushTow: Vessel designed for pushing/towing, facilitating the movement
				of one or more cargo barges.
		- fishingBoat: Vessel designed for fishing.
		- bunkerShip: Vessel designed for carrying and delivering bunkers.

		When the value of method is either "mail" or "unknown", there are no
		specific values of means defined.

<!--
    A Credential Message Authentication Code (MAC).  This is used in
    situations where one party (the sender) must prove to another (the
    receiver) that it is authenticated by a shared secret with a third
    party trusted by both.

    The MAC should be computed by the trusted third party and
    transferred to the sender.  The MAC should be opaque to the sender
    (i.e., it should be secure and non-reversible).  The MAC should
    use as its inputs enough information to accomplish the following
    goals:

    (1) The MAC must prove to the receiver that it really originated
    with the trusted third party.  E.g., the MAC could use a shared
    secret between the receiver and the trusted third party as its
    secret key.

    (2) The MAC should be usable only by a certain sender.  E.g., the
    MAC could authenticate an identifier for the sending organization.

    (3) The MAC should prove that the sender is authorized to send on
    behalf of the From organization.  E.g., the MAC could authenticate
    an identifier for the From organization.

    (4) The MAC should limit the risk of the MAC being compromised and
    used to impersonate the sender by another party communicating with
    the receiver.  E.g., the MAC could authenticate an expiration date
    or sequence number.

    type
        An implementation-dependent identifier for the exact data
        being authenticated and the method in which it is formatted
        for authentication.  Currently the only supported value is
        "FromSenderCredentials".

    algorithm
        An implementation-dependent identifier for the exact MAC
        algorithm used on the data.  Currently the only supported
        value is "HMAC-SHA1-96".

    creationDate
        The time at which this MAC was issued.  The receiver must not
        accept the MAC before this time.

    expirationDate
        The time at which this MAC expires.  The receiver must not
        accept the MAC after this time.

        Date the Contract is available for ordering/releases.

    expirationDate
        Date the Contract is no longer available.

    operation:
        "new" operation identifies a new Contract transaction.
        "update" operation identified an update to an existing transaction.
        the DocumentInfo attribute can be used to indicate the Document information
        in the external system.
        "delete" operation will be used to cancel an existing Contract, the
        assumption here is that the delete request will be an exact replica of the
        original request.

    LegalEntity
        Legal entity defined in the external system. Smallest organizational unit of external accounting for which a complete,
        self-contained set of accounts can be created. This includes the entry of all transactions that must be posted and

        For example, Company Code for SAP.

    OrganizationalUnit
        Purchase Unit or Purchase group defined in the external system.

        A purchasing group corresponds to a buyer or group of buyers who perform the following
        purchasing activities: Procuring certain articles or merchandise categories Acting as the contact for vendors
        For example, Purchasing Organization or Purchasing Group for SAP.

                 10101
            </OrganizationalUnit>


    DocumentInfo
        Contract Id managed in the external system. This would be sent for "update" operation.
        For example,
        <DocumentInfo documentID="55000000" documentType="Contract"/>

    ParentContractInfo
        Parent contract Id if the current contract is a part of an hierarchy.


    QuoteRequestReference
        If the contract is referencing to QuoteRequest originated from the external system, send requestId and requestDate.


    TermsOfDelivery
        Optional shipping terms (incoTerms) as defined by the International Chamber of
        Commerce. These terms inform the buyer which portion of the shipping charges are their responsibility.
        For example,
        <TermsOfDelivery>
            <TermsOfDeliveryCode value="TransportCondition"/>

        </ReferenceDocumentInfo>

    Note:
        The lineNumber attribute in the <ItemIn> will be used to specify the corresponding
        lineNumber on the contract in the source buyer system.
        At an implementation, level checks should be made to validate this.

    Note:
        itemClassification attribute in the <ItemIn> will be used to specify whether the current line item is material or service.

    Note:
        The external system Id of PaymentTerm can be sent as an extrinsic inside of <PaymentTerm>
        For example,
         <PaymentTerm payInNumberOfDays="30">

             </Address>
          </ShipTo>


    Note:
        <IdReference> in <ItemID> will be used to send the corresponding line number of the
        contract in the external system. For example, domain = 'SAPLineNumber', identifier='0100'

    Note:
        The quantity attribute in the ItemIn tag should be set to target quantity. If the line item is amount based,
        it could be set to one.

    Note:
        The UnitsOfMeasure of Min/MaxQuantity and Min/MaxReleaseQuantity is same as the one in ItemDetail.

    Note:
        The MaxReleaseAmount/Quantity and MinReleaseAmount/Quantity at an item level
        indicate the item level amounts and quantities per release (purchase order).

    Note:
        <Modifications> in <UnitPrice> will be used to send Discount amount/percent, Surcharges, Tax, and etc.
        For example,

    AuthRequest

    An AuthRequest is used when one party (the "receiver") receives
    credentials from another party (the "principal") and the receiver
    needs a trusted third party to validate the credentials.  The
    receiver should enclose the credentials in an AuthRequest and send
    them to the trusted third party for validation.

    If the principal attempts to authenticate by revealing the shared
    secret between itself and the trusted third party (not
    recommended), the receiver should forward the credentials as they
    were received, including the shared secret.

    If the principal attempts to authenticate through a client
    certificate (recommended), the receiver should forward the
    credentials as well as an X509Data element containing an
    X509IssuerSerial element describing the certificate used by the
    principal (the receiver normally obtains this information from its
    webserver or SSL/TLS implementation).

    If the supplied credential is invalid, the trusted third party
    should respond with an empty cXML response of status 403
    (Forbidden).  If the supplied credential is valid, the trusted
    third party should respond with an AuthResponse that contains the
    valid credentials.

    Details about quality inspection request.

    QualityInspectionCharacteristic
        Represents an inspection characteristic that describes what should be inspected.
        A quality inspection request can contain one or more characteristics.
-->
<!ELEMENT QualityInspectionRequestDetail (QualityInspectionCharacteristic+)>

<!--  
    Represents an inspection characteristic that describes what should be inspected.

    characteristicID
        Number of the characteristic, the combination of this attribute with operationNumber should be unique.
    operationNumber
        Inspection operation, the combination of this attribute with characteristicID should be unique.
    workCenter
        Work center number.
    procedure
        Specifies how the sample size is calculated and how the inspection characteristic is valuated, is a text value.   
    isLocked
        If a characteristic is locked not more valuations are allowed for this characteristic.
    allowDefectRecording
        If you set this indicator and an inspection characteristic is rejected during results recording, the function for recording defects for a characteristic is automatically called up.
    characteristicType
        You use inspection characteristics to describe the inspection criteria for materials, parts, and products. This allows you to plan inspections systematically, uniformly, and economically. An inspection request can contain different type of characteristics some required, optional or conditional.
            required, the inspection of this characteristic is required to create an Inspection Decision.
            optional, the inspection of this characteristic is not required to create an Inspection Decision.
            afterAccept, if this type is selected, this conditional inspection characteristic must be inspected if the previous
                required characteristic was valuated as accepted. 
                i.e. QualityInspectionRequest with 3 characteristics, second one is "required", third one is "afterAccept". 
                If the valuation of second characteristic is accepted, the third characteristic should be inspected.
            afterRejection, if this type is selected, this conditional inspection characteristic must be inspected if the previous 
                required characteristic in the operation was valuated as rejected.
                i.e. QualityInspectionRequest with 3 characteristics, second one is "required", third one is "afterRejection". 
                If the valuation of second characteristic is rejected, the third characteristic should be inspected.
    isQuantitative
            If send (Quantitative), it means numerical measurement for this characteristic.
            If not send (Qualitative), it means non-numerical measurement for this characteristic.

        The only Contact roles (Contact@role attribute value) likely to be sensible in this element are
        "locationFrom" and "locationTo". locationFrom can be used by the supplier system to the determine 
        the buyer notified ERP vendor ID or vendor location. locationTo can be used by the supplier system to 
        determine the location of the buyer where the product demand originates.  
        To provide a plant location description, the domain attribute of the element IdReference should be set to "buyerLocationID", "supplierLocationID" or "storageLocation" and the identifier to the plantID.
    Inventory
        Inventory that is in the possession of the buyer, and is owned and managed by the buyer.
    ConsignmentInventory
        Inventory that is in the possession of the buyer, but is owned by the supplier.
    TimeSeries
        Forecast data, can be of type "demand" or "orderForecast"
