Revision history for Perl extension Business::FedEx::RateRequest.

______________________________________
1.00 Sun Feb 02 2014

* Fedex without warning changed the return xml document. The elements with versionized name spaces were changed to generic tags.
What was <v9:RateReplyDetails> is now <RateReplyDetails>

0.97 Mon April 02 2012

* Added timestamp to the xlm request.

* Also added 'dst_residential' and 'insured_value' to the optional args. 

'dst_residential' can either be 'true' or 'false'. This significantly effects the 
the rates. The default is 'false'

* Improved error reporting if no valid rates are returned an err_msg is set to the
returned 'faultstring' from FedEx

Bug fixes and new functionality contributed by Kyle Albritton.

----- Changes -----
* Replaced "â" with "-" on ship notes.  The soft-hyphen "â" character was imported from a cut-n-paste from 
FedEx documentation but print problems where encountered on some browsers. 

* Added functionality to include the ability to specify dropoff_type which significantly influences rates. 

* Added notes to documentation on allowable parameters in METHODS item $obj->get_rates(%hash):

Valid weight_units values are LB, KG.
Valid size_units are IN, CM.
Valid dropoff_types are REGULAR_PICKUP, BUSINESS_SERVICE_CENTER, DROP_BOX, REQUEST_COURIER, STATION.

----- Bug Fixes ----- 
* Fixed inconsistent key names on arguments and xml entries so that size and weight units work

Added Tags and Notes. Attempted to align ServiceTypes with notes. I could not exercise
each of these ServiceTypes so there may be missing notes.
