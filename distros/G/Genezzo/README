NAME

  Genezzo - an extensible database system

DESCRIPTION

  The Genezzo modules implement a hierarchy of persistent
  hashes using a fixed amount of memory and disk.  This system is
  designed to be easily configured and extended with custom functions,
  persistent storage representations, and novel data access methods.
  In its current incarnation it supports a limited subset of SQL with
  a command line tool [gendba] and a partial DBI-style interface.

REQUIREMENTS

 Perl 5.6    

INSTALLATION

  If you can read this, then you figured out how to uncompress and
  untar the archive.  

  perl Makefile.PL  # constructs the makefile
  make              
  make test         
  make install      # (as superuser [optional])


  If you install Genezzo, you should be able to run the line-mode tool
  directly by typing "gendba.pl" at the command line.

  You also should be able to run scripts from the directory containing
  this file, something like:

  perl -Iblib/lib lib/Genezzo/gendba.pl


USAGE

  line mode available via (/usr/bin) gendba.pl.  
  Try:

    gendba.pl -help
    gendba.pl -man 

  or:

    perl -Iblib/lib lib/Genezzo/gendba.pl -help
    perl -Iblib/lib lib/Genezzo/gendba.pl -man

  for more information.

  The GenDBI module supports a subset of DBI-style calls.  See
  dbi_example.pl for some sample usage.

  Try:

    perl -Iblib/lib demo/dbi_example.pl # runs an example
    perldoc Genezzo::GenDBI

  for more information.

  The simplest way to create an instance of a Genezzo database is to use:

    gendba.pl -init

  This command will create a new database and login to the
  command-line.  

SQL SUPPORT -- see LIMITATIONS

  EXPRESSIONS: The Genezzo parser can handle expressions composed of
               column names, numeric or quoted string constants,
               logical constants like TRUE, FALSE and NULL,
               concatenation, scalar functions, and basic arithmetic
               like '+', '-', '*', '/'.  However, logical expressions
               using AND, OR, and NOT are only legal in the WHERE clause.

  INSERT: 
    INSERT INTO tablename VALUES (expr [, expr ...]);
    INSERT INTO tablename (colname [, colname ...]) VALUES (expr [, expr ...]);
    INSERT INTO tablename SELECT ... FROM ...

  UPDATE:
    UPDATE tablename SET colname = expr [, colname = expr ...] [WHERE ...]

  DELETE:
    DELETE FROM tablename [WHERE ...]

  SELECT:  The Genezzo parser can parse complex SELECT statements,
           but the execution engine can only handle simple SELECTS
           and basic joins.

    SELECT * FROM tablename [WHERE ...]
    SELECT COUNT(*) FROM tablename 
    SELECT ECOUNT(*) FROM tablename
    SELECT * FROM t1, t2 WHERE t1.col1 = t2.col1    

    SELECT expr [[AS] column_alias] [, expr [[AS] column_alias]]
      FROM tablename
      [WHERE ...]

  CREATE TABLE: 
    CREATE TABLE tablename (colname coltype [, colname coltype ...]);

  CREATE INDEX:
    CREATE INDEX iname on tablename (colname [, colname ...]);

  ALTER TABLE ADD CONSTRAINT: supports primary and unique key and
    check constraints.  NOT NULL and foreign keys are not currently
    supported, though you can implement NOT NULL as 
    CHECK (colname IS NOT NULL).  The CHECK expression is equivalent
    to a WHERE clause.  A table can have multiple CHECK constraints,
    but currently only one key constraint.

    ALTER TABLE tablename 
          ADD [CONSTRAINT constraint_name] 
              PRIMARY KEY (colname [, colname ...]);
    ALTER TABLE tablename 
          ADD [CONSTRAINT constraint_name] 
              UNIQUE (colname [, colname ...]);
    ALTER TABLE tablename 
          ADD [CONSTRAINT constraint_name] 
              CHECK (conditional_expression);

  ADDFILE: Not really a SQL command, but an extension to grow the 
           datafiles.  See "addfile help".

  DROP: drop a table or index.
  COMMIT: write changes to disk.
  SYNC: write changes to disk like "commit", but don't end a transaction.
  ROLLBACK: discard all uncommitted changes.

  DESCRIBE: 
    DESCRIBE tablename

  EXPLAIN PLAN: dump parsing and plan information for any SQL command,
                including CREATE and ALTER TABLE.  Does not require a
                "plan table".  Can perform partial explanations for 
                invalid statements, such as missing tables/columns, etc.
                Example - "explain plan for select * from t1;"
                or even complex sql like:
                Explain plan for
                  select * from t1 
                           where c1 in (select avg(c2) from t2)
                           having avg(c3) > ((select min(c4)
                                             from (select c5 from t3
                                                   union    
                                                   select c6 from t4)
                                             ) + 5) * 7 / min(c7)     ;

  STARTUP/SHUTDOWN: 

LIMITATIONS

  General: No locking/multiuser support, bind variables,          
  incomplete DBI support.

  SELECT: Simple queries only -- no ORDER BY, GROUP BY, 
          HAVING, subqueries, set functions (UNION, INTERSECT).
          Only basic FROM clause joins: FROM t1, t2, ... are
          supported.
          No aggregation functions other than COUNT(*), ECOUNT(*).
          COUNT and ECOUNT do not accept a WHERE clause.
  
  ALTER TABLE: no foreign key, NULL/NOT NULL constraints.

  CREATE TABLE: Only numeric and character datatypes are accepted.
                Datatype length and precision are not enforced.
                Numeric columns will accept arbitrary character input,
                but will attempt to use numeric (versus character) 
                comparisons.  No table or column constraints.
                No CREATE TABLE AS SELECT.

EXAMPLES
        
  Some very basic SQL create/drop/describe table, select, insert, update
  and delete syntax is supported, and like standard SQL, table and
  column names are case-insensitive unless quoted.  More complex SQL
  parses, but is ignored.  While many scalar SQL functions are available, 
  the only supported aggregation functions are count(*) and ecount(*),
  a non-blocking count estimation function.  The database also
  supports commit to force changes to disk, and a crude rollback. 
  NOTE: Data definition (such as create table or ct) must be manually
  committed to keep the database in a consistent state.  Uncommitted
  inserts and updates will only be block-consistent -- there is no
  guarantee that the data will get flushed to disk, and no
  guarantee whether the changes will or will not take effect.

    rem  Some simple SELECTs
    select * from _col1;
    select rid, rownum, tname, colname from _col1;
    select count(*) from _col1;
    select ecount(*) from _col1;

    rem  SELECTs with WHERE, perl and SQL style.
    select * from _tab1 where tname =~ m/col/;
    select * from _tab1 where tid < 5;
    select * from _tab1 where numcols > 3 AND numcols < 6;

    rem basic joins
    select * from _tab1, _col1  where _tab1.tid = _col1.tid 
     and _tab1.tname =~ m/col/;

    rem  Column aliases and Expressions
    select tid as Table_ID, tname Name, (tid+1)/2 from _tab1;

    rem  Basic INSERT
    insert into test1 values ('a','b','c','d');
    insert into test1(col2, col1) values ('a','b','c','d');

    rem CREATE TABLE and INSERT...SELECT
    create table test2(col1 char, col2 char);
    insert into test2 (col1) select col1 from test1;

    rem  DELETE with WHERE
    delete from test1 where col1 < 'bravo' and col2 > 5;

    rem  UPDATE with WHERE (no subqueries supported)
    update test2 set col2 = 'foo' where col2 is null;

    commit

  By default, the database will autostart -- the gendba.pl command will
  connect to an active, updateable instance.  The shutdown command will
  reset the database to a read-only mode that only provides read access
  to certain dictionary tables.  The startup command will restart the
  database.

  The Genezzo parser also supports the Feeble query language, as
  described by gendba.pl -man.  Briefly, the commands are ct (create
  table), dt (drop table), i (insert), u (update), d (delete), s
  (select).  The following example creates a table EMP with two
  columns, ENAME (as character) and ID (as number), inserts five rows,
  and counts them.

    ct EMP ENAME=c ID=n
    i EMP bob 1 orville 2 wilbur 3 harry 4 luke 5
    s EMP count
    s EMP ecount
    commit

  While the SQL update and delete commands support a WHERE clause, the
  Feeble "u" and "d" commands only work via rowid.  For example:

    gendba 10> s EMP rid rownum *
    rid     rownum  ename   id
    ___     ______  _____   __

    1/33/1  1       bob     1
    1/33/2  2       orville 2
    1/33/3  3       wilbur  3
    1/33/4  4       harry   4
    1/33/5  5       luke    5

    5 rows selected.

    gendba 11> d EMP 1/33/1
    deleted 1 rows from table emp.

    gendba 12> u EMP 1/33/5 margo 66
    updated 1 rows in table emp.

    gendba 13> !10
    s EMP rid rownum *
    rid     rownum  ename   id
    ___     ______  _____   __

    1/33/2  1       orville 2
    1/33/3  2       wilbur  3
    1/33/4  3       harry   4
    1/33/5  4       margo   66

    4 rows selected.

  The default database is stored in a fixed-size 160K file.  You can
  change the default filesize and the blocksize at database
  initialization time.  For example:

    gendba.pl -init -define blocksize=8k -define dbsize=10M

  to create a database with a 10 megabyte datafile using 8K blocks.
  By default, this file is a fixed size, but it can be set to grow
  using the "increase_by" settings added in version 0.18.  Also, you can
  add additional files to your database using the "addfile" command.  By
  default, each file is double the size of the previous.  Type "addfile
  help" for more options.


NEW FEATURES - Indexed Tables

  Version 0.13 introduces an indexed-table type.  An indexed table
  treats the first column in the table definition as a unique, not-null
  primary key.  Note that an "Indexed Table" is distinct from an
  ordinary table with a separate index, where you can assign a separate
  index object to a particular column or group of columns.

    gendba 9> ct EMP index id=n name=c
    Create Table : emp 
    with unique index option
    tablename : emp
    column id : n (primary key)
    column name : c
    table emp created 

    gendba 10> i EMP 1 bob 2 orville 3 wilbur 4 harry 5 luke
    inserted 5 rows into table emp.

    gendba 11> s EMP rid *
    rid     id      name
    ___     __      ____

    1       1       bob
    2       2       orville
    3       3       wilbur
    4       4       harry
    5       5       luke

    5 rows selected.

    gendba 12> i EMP 1 bob 2 orville 3 wilbur 4 harry 5 luke
    whisper: duplicate key 1
    Failed to insert row 1 in table emp at lib/Genezzo/gendba.pl line 230
    inserted 0 rows into table emp.

    gendba 13> select tid, tname, otype from _tab1 where tname = 'emp'
    tid     tname   otype
    ___     _____   _____

    14      emp     IDXTAB

    1 row selected.


  Notice that the first column is marked as a primary key when the
  table is created, and the rids for indexed tables are the primary key,
  not a physical block address.  

  Indexed tables have an object type of IDXTAB in the data dictionary
  -- conventional tables are marked as TABLE.

  WHERE clause processing has been enhanced to use equality predicates
  (e.g. "SELECT * from EMP where id = 2") to drive index scans.  Any
  series of "AND"ed predicates is a candidate for an efficient index
  search, but the use of an OR currently requires a full table scan.

  CAVEATS:  The index performance is pretty poor, for a couple reasons.
  It should improve a lot.  

NEW FEATURES - Indexes

  Users can now define their own indexes.  The dictionary
  automatically maintains indexes on its own tables.  In order to create
  an index called EMP_I1 on the ID column of table EMP, the command is:
  
      Create Index EMP_I1 on EMP (ID)

  You can have arbitrary combinations of numeric and character keys.
  RESTRICTIONS: only one index per table currently.  Index keys must
  be less than one-half of the db blocksize.  

  In version 0.15, the query engine will use the index to drive the
  row fetch for a SELECT if the WHERE clause specifies an equality 
  predicate on the primary key.  For example:

      Select * from EMP where ID = 5
 
  uses an index.  In general, additional predicates may accompany the
  equality expression as long as they are ANDed:

      Select * from EMP where ID = 5 and ENAME =~ m/BOB/

  However, the presence of ORs causes the plan to revert to a full
  table scan:

      Select * from EMP where ID = 5 or ID = 6

  All user-defined indexes are non-unique.  Unique indexes should be
  created as unique constraints (fixed in version 0.22) using 
  ALTER TABLE.

NEW FEATURES - automatic tablespace and file growth

  In version 0.18, datafiles are no longer a fixed size.  The column
  "increase_by" in table _tsfiles controls the behavior: if this column
  is blank, null, or zero, the datafile size is fixed.  If
  "increase_by" is a non-zero number, the datafile will attempt to grow by 
  that many bytes if it runs out of free extents.  If "increase_by" is a
  percentage like "50%", the datafile is extended by the current size
  multiplied by this percentage.  The AddFile command now takes
  "increase_by" as an optional argument.  

  Also in version 0.18, each tablespace can be configured to
  automatically create new datafiles when the current datafile runs out
  of free extents.  The column "addfile" in table _tspace controls the
  behavior: if the column is blank or null, then the tablespace must be
  extended manually.  If the "addfile" column contains a valid argument 
  list for the AddFile command, then this command will get invoked when 
  all of the current datafiles are full.  Note that the datafiles can be 
  of a fixed size, or use the new "increase_by" parameter to grow to some
  maximum size (currently 2G).

  Prior to version 0.69, the simplest way to alter tablespace settings
  was the "bigdb.sql" script.  This script is supplanted in version 0.69
  by the alter_ts() utility function.  The command:
    select alter_ts() from dual;
  will, by default, upgrade the SYSTEM tablespace to use a base file
  size of 10M which automatically grows in 50% increments.  For more 
  information, in gendba.pl line-mode please type:
    help area=utility_functions alter_ts
  
NEW FEATURES - ALTER TABLE ADD CONSTRAINT

  Version 0.20 supports ALTER TABLE ADD CONSTRAINT <name> CHECK (<check-text>).

  The check-text is any basic where clause predicate.  Example:

    gendba 3> create table testcon (col1 c, col2 n);
    table testcon created 
    
    gendba 4> alter table testcon add constraint cn1 
              check ((col2 > 5) AND col1 =~ m/(a|b|c)/)
    Added constraint cn1 to table testcon
    
    gendba 5> insert into testcon values ('a', 7);
    inserted 1 row into table testcon.
    
    gendba 6> insert into testcon values ('b', 8);
    inserted 1 row into table testcon.
    
    gendba 7> insert into testcon values ('d', 8);
    WARNING: violated constraint cn1
    must satisfy (col2 > 5) AND col1 =~ m/(a|b|c)/
    WARNING: Failed to insert row 1 in table testcon
    inserted 0 rows into table testcon.
    
    gendba 8> insert into testcon values ('a', 1);
    WARNING: violated constraint cn1
    must satisfy (col2 > 5) AND col1 =~ m/(a|b|c)/
    WARNING: Failed to insert row 1 in table testcon
    inserted 0 rows into table testcon.


  Version 0.22 supports 
    ALTER TABLE ADD CONSTRAINT <name> UNIQUE (<column-list>)
    and
    ALTER TABLE ADD CONSTRAINT <name> PRIMARY KEY (<column-list>

  Version 0.22 only supports a single constraint or single index per
  table, but version 0.23 supports multiple constraints and indexes
  on a table.
  
  Need to extend to fully support NULL/NOT NULL, FOREIGN KEY, plus
  ENABLE/DISABLE.

NEW FEATURES - System/User Extensibility

  Version 0.25 of Genezzo supports database extensibility.  See
  Genezzo::Havok for more details.  The script "havok.sql" (now
  deprecated) can be used to add extensibility tables to your database.
  In version 0.58 a new function HavokUse supercedes the havok.sql
  script, and the table user_extend is supplanted in version 0.59 by
  Havok::UserFunctions.

NEW FEATURES - Improved error reporting, handling

  Version 0.31 error reporting has been significantly reworked to be
  more compatible with DBI.  In particular, Genezzo::GenDBI->connect now
  takes an optional attribute hash with PrintError and RaiseError, so
  it will print messages using warn() or die().  In addition, it also
  supports a GZERR argument is used to replace the internal Genezzo
  error handlers.  More documentation exists in GenDBI.pm.  The DBI
  standard err and errstr aren't supported yet.

NEW FEATURES - backward compatiblity
  
  Version 0.32 supports a compatibility matrix - it can support version 0.31
  databases.  Genezzo can now maintain a list of which versions use the same
  database format.  Need to extend this capability to get automatic upgrade
  between different database revisions.

NEW FEATURES - database export, rollback, quoted strings,  
               dynamic system extensions
  
  Version 0.33 introduces genexpl.pl, a very, very basic data export 
  utility.  A "rollback" command is now available, which will discard 
  all in-memory changes and replace them with the previous committed
  results.  Note that the buffer cache will automatically flush data
  to disk when it is full, so rollback will not be able to restore
  data in this case.  Single-quoted strings in SQL expressions now
  support backslash quoting, so 'foo\\bar\'s' is interpreted as
  foo\bar's.  Finally, a new Havok module called SysHook supports 
  extensions to basic Genezzo database functions.  SysHook is 
  restructured in version 0.34.

NEW FEATURES - multiline SQL statements

  Version 0.38 allows multiline SQL statements for SELECT, INSERT,
  UPDATE, DELETE, and EXPLAIN in the gendba interactive line mode.
  These statements must be terminated by a semicolon.

NEW FEATURES - Improved Parser

  Version 0.39 uses a new parser based upon Parse::RecDescent
  for SELECT statements.  The new parser is stricter about 
  quoting conventions and identifier names -- standard identifiers
  must start with an alpha character, or be specified in double quotes.
  Only identifiers can be unquoted.  String literals must be in single
  quotes.  The parser does make an exception for dictionary tables like
  _tab1 and _col1, which do *not* need to quoted.  Boolean operations
  must use AND and OR, not && and ||.  || is the SQL string concatenation 
  operation.  The count estimation function ECOUNT must be specified as
  ecount(*) in the select list.

  While the parser is smarter, the execution phase is not improved.  The
  only supported aggregation functions are count(*) or ecount(*) in the
  select list.  Having, Group By, and Order By are still missing.

  Version 0.40 allows arbitrary expressions in SELECT lists, e.g:

      Select tid+5/2 from _tab1;

  Version 0.41 adds support for the literals TRUE, FALSE, and NULL,
  and extends the new parser to cover ALTER TABLE, DELETE, and INSERT.
  INSERT can now handle arbitrary expressions, e.g:

     Insert into mytable values (1+1, 2*2, 3/4);
  
  Version 0.42 adds arbitrary expression support to UPDATE, and marks
  the complete switchover to the new parser.

  Version 0.43 adds case-insensitive table and column names.

NEW FEATURES - Raw Device support
  Version 0.44 and 0.45 add support for raw io devices.          

NEW FEATURES - Additional User-supplied Preferences and File Header Info
  In Version 0.47, users can supply arbitrary command-line definitions
  for the dictionary preference table or fileheader info using
  -define and -fileheader_define, respectively.

NEW FEATURES - Object-Oriented SysHooks
  In Version 0.47, a single package can load multiple functions as 
  a set of class methods, versus package methods.

NEW FEATURES - Tablespaces
  In Version 0.51, users can create additional tablespaces (collections
  of datafiles for storage) for tables and indexes.  By default, all
  tables and indexes are created in the SYSTEM tablespace.  The command
  "CREATE TABLESPACE tablespace_name" creates a new, empty tablespace.
  You must add files to the tablespace use "addfile tsname=..." or "af
  tsname=..." before it can be used.  See "addfile help" for more details.
  CREATE TABLE and CREATE INDEX now take a new TABLESPACE option.  Note
  that key constraints on a table inherit its tablespace.  A table or
  index can only be stored in a single tablespace, and they cannot be
  moved to a different tablespace.  Additional files may be added to any
  tablespace at any time.  Currently, there is no support for DROP
  TABLESPACE, or taking tablespace offline.  Example:

  gendba 1> create tablespace ts1
  gendba 2> addfile tsname=ts1
  gendba 3> create table mytab (col1 char) tablespace ts1

NEW FEATURES - Joins
  In Version 0.52, basic joins are supported.

NEW FEATURES - DUAL table

  In version 0.58, Genezzo provides a single-row DUAL table which is
  useful for evaluating expressions, e.g.:

  gendba 1>  select (((5+5)/4)*32) from dual;
  (((5+5)/4)*32)
  ______________

  80

  1 row selected.


NEW FEATURES - HavokUse function for System/User Extensibility

  In version 0.58, the HavokUse function supercedes the havok.sql and
  syshook.sql scripts.  HavokUse operates on Havok modules in a
  fashion analogous to the way perl "use" loads perl modules. Havok
  modules now use a metadata document similar to the MakeMaker META.yml
  which lists module dependencies, table definitions, etc.  For example,
  to load Genezzo::Havok::SysHook, use the command:

      Select HavokUse('Genezzo::Havok::SysHook') from dual;

  If the havok and sys_hook tables do not exist, HavokUse will create
  and update these tables.  If the tables already exist, HavokUse will
  do nothing, but return successfully.  See the Havok module for more
  details.  Note that the "select" statement is now invoking
  dictionary actions which may create and update new tables, and which
  may need to be committed.  Also, prior to version 0.71, HavokUse
  only performs partial initialization -- it is still necessary to
  commit, shutdown and restart to activate the new Havok modules.
  Modules created after version 0.71 can use add_user_function and
  add_sys_hook to dynamically load new functionality.

NEW FEATURES - Havok::UserFunctions, standard SQL scalar functions

  Previously, all standard perl functions could be invoked in a SQL
  statement, and additional SQL functions were optionally added via
  Havok::UserExtend.  In version 0.59, Havok::UserExtend has been
  deprecated and replaced with Havok::UserFunctions, and Genezzo only
  supports functions defined in the new user_functions table.  This
  table is preloaded when the database is created with many common
  perl and sql functions.

  The perl functions which are available in SQL are:

    chomp, chop, chr, crypt, index, lc, lcfirst, length, ord, pack,
    reverse, rindex, sprintf, substr, uc, ucfirst, abs, atan2, cos, exp,
    hex, int, log10 (to avoid confusion between natural log and base10),
    oct, rand, sin, sqrt, srand, and perl_join (which is renamed to
    avoid a conflict with the SQL JOIN operation).

  The SQL string functions are concat, greatest, initcap, least, lower,
  and upper.  The SQL math functions are cosh, ceil, floor, ln, sinh, tan, 
  and tanh (also note many standard SQL math functions are identical to their
  perl counterparts, which are listed above).  The SQL conversion
  functions are ascii, instr, and nvl.

  Version 0.67 has many fixes plus added support for the string
  functions lpad, ltrim, rpad, rtrim, translate, replace, and soundex
  and the math functions mod, power, round, sign, trunc, logN.  Please
  see Genezzo::Havok::SQLScalar or "help area=sql_functions" for more
  information.

  Version 0.69 adds the utility function add_user_function() which
  simplifies the creation of new sql functions. In gendba.pl 
  line-mode please type:
    help area=utility_functions add_user_function
  for more information.

NEW FEATURES - improved genexp.pl
 
  The version 0.60 database export (genexp.pl) now correctly handles table
  constraints and indexes.

NEW FEATURES - Feeble/SQL compatible case-sensitivity

  Prior to version 0.63, Feeble commands (ct, d, u, s) did not match
  the SQL behavior for case-insensitive identifiers.  For example, the
  Feeble command:
    "ct EMP COL1=c" 
  would create a table called EMP (uppercase) with a column COL1, while
  the SQL command:
    "create table EMP (COL1 char(10))"
  would create a table called emp (lowercase) with a column col1.
  This discrepancy would require the use of quoted identifiers in SQL
  in order to reference uppercase or mixed case table or column names.
  To facilitate interoperablity between Feeble and SQL, Feeble now
  matches the SQL usage and legal naming restrictions for unquoted,
  case-insensitive names, and uppercase or mixed case names are only
  available using SQL quoted identifiers.  Feeble does not support
  quoted names.

NEW FEATURES - additional comparison functions IN, LIKE

  In version 0.68, basic support for IN and LIKE comparison is
  supported.  IN only supports expression lists, not subqueries, e.g:

  Select * from tab1 where col1 IN ('a', 'b', 'c');
  Select * from tab2 where col2 NOT IN (22,33,44);

  The LIKE operator supported as a function (versus a separate clause),
  e.g:

  Select * from tab1 where col3 LIKE ('foo%');
  Select * from tab1 where col3 NOT LIKE ('#_foo_', '#');

  The first argument to LIKE is a pattern which can take two special
  matching characters -- a percent ('%') which is a wildcard (any number
  of characters, including zero), and an underscore ('_') which matches
  a single character.  The optional second argument is an ESCAPE
  character.  If the '%' or '_' is prefixed with the ESCAPE character it
  is treated as a literal.  Note that LIKE comparisons are
  case-sensitive.

NEW FEATURES - additional utility functions add_user_function, alter_ts
  
  In version 0.69 utility functions simplify the tasks of adding new
  user functions, and altering tablespaces for large databases. 
  In gendba.pl line-mode please type:
    help area=utility_functions long=alter_ts add_user_function
  for more information.

NEW FEATURES - improved HELP
  
  In version 0.70 the help system is re-organized and enhanced.  The
  new help supports regex lookup, loadable help modules, and online
  support for the SQL functions.  In gendba.pl line-mode, try:
    Help Help
  or
    Help area=sql
  for more information.

NEW FEATURES - dynamic system hooks
 
  Prior to version 0.71, the Genezzo::Havok::SysHook module required
  direct modification of the sys_hook table.  In version 0.71, the
  function add_sys_hook can be used to dynamically add system hooks to a
  running Genezzo instance.  In gendba.pl line-mode please type:
    help area=system_hooks add_sys_hook
  for more information.

NEW FEATURES - self-managed extents

  In version 0.72 the extent code keeps better track of block usage,
  allowing the more efficient re-use of space from deleted rows.

INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES

  Version 0.72 dictionary and block format is incompatible with
  previous releases.  No upgrade path is supported.
  Version 0.48 thru 0.50 are compatible.
