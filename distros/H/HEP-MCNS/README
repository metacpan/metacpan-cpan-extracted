NAME

    HEP::MCNS - converts HEP MC numbers into particle names and vice versa

VERSION

    version 0.022

SYNOPSIS

            use HEP::MCNS qw(particle_name particle_code);
            my $electron_name = particle_name( 11 );
            my $bzero_name = particle_name( 511 );
            my $bplus_code = particle_code( 'B+' );
            my $dstar_code = particle_code( 'D*0' );

DESCRIPTION

    The Monte Carlo Numbering Scheme
    <http://pdg.lbl.gov/2014/reviews/rpp2014-rev-monte-carlo-numbering.pdf>
    assigns a unique identifier to each particle. This module converts
    those numbers into readable particle names and vice versa.

    If any number is missing/wrong, please file an issue.

    LaTeX output is planned but not yet implemented

FUNCTIONS

 particle_name

    takes the Monte Carlo number as input and prints the particle name

 particle_code

    takes a particle name and returns the MC number code
