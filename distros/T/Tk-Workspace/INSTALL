Tk::Workspace.pm, Version 1.75, installation:

The Tk::Workspace.pm distribution has been tested only on the Linux
and Solaris operating systems.  Refer all questions and problem
reports to the author, Robert Allan Kiesling <rkiesling@earthlink.net>.


System Requirements:

1.  A Unix or derivative operating system.
2.  Perl version 5.005 or greater.
3.  Perl/Tk, version 800.022 or later.
4.  GNU make.

Optional:

The following packages, which are available at http://www.cpan.org/,
are required to enable specific features: 

  Remote File Import/Export

    1. Net::FTP (part of libnet)

  Unicode Support:

    1. MIME::Base64
    2. Unicode::Map
    3. Unicode::String

Installation:

1.  Untar the Tk-Workspace-1.75 archive with the guzip and tar commands:

  # gzip -dc Tk-Workspace-1.75.tar.gz | tar xvf -
 
   or, using GNU tar,

  # tar zxvf Tk-Workspace-1.75.tar.gz

2.  Change to the top-level subdirectory:

  # cd Tk-Workspace-1.75

3.  Optionally, install the workspace.xpm icon in your normal personal
    or system icon directory if you have permission to do so.  (For
    example, "/home/joeuser/.icons/workspace.xpm".)  Edit the value of
    $iconpath in line 32 of Workspace.pm to the icon's full pathname,
    including the quotes.

4.  The top-level Makefile should work on any Unix or derivative
    system that has GNU make installed.  It uses the Perl ExtUtils 
    installation to build the package's Makefile.  At the prompt, 
    type:

  # perl Makefile.PL

5.  Build the program modules and documentation.  Type:

  # make

6.  If necessary, become root (via "su", for example), and 
    install the source files and documentation in the system's 
    site_perl library.

  # su
  Enter Password:
  $ make install
