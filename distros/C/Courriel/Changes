0.44     2016-12-05

- The changes to use Params::ValidationCompiler in 0.43 were not quite
  correct, and since Params::ValidationCompiler 0.20 started doing more
  validation of calls to validation_for(), this cause an exception. Reported
  by Todd Bruner. RT #119137.


0.43     2016-11-13

- Replaced MooseX::Params::Validate with Params::ValidationCompiler.


0.42     2016-07-04

- Require the latest version of DateTime::Format::Mail in order to avoid
  warnings from DateTime 1.32+ that will cause some tests to fail. Reported by
  Olaf Alders. RT #115868.


0.41     2016-03-05

- Fixed header folding for headers that contain non-true values like
  '0'. Based on a patch for Email::Simple from
  pali. https://github.com/rjbs/Email-Simple/pull/11.


0.40     2016-01-30

- Fixed the stringification of some headers with regards to encoding. The
  Received header should never be encoded (and thus should never contain
  non-ASCII).

- Fixed headers which contain email addresses (To, From, CC) so that email
  addresses are properly encoded (I think). The phrase and comment portions of
  the address can contain encoded-words, but the address itself should never
  be encoded. Note that per RFC6531 addresses may contain UTF-8, but the MTA
  must support the SMTPUTF8 extension in order for the mail to be
  delivered. As of this release, SMTPUTF8 support does not appear to be very
  widespread, so I would strongly discourage the use of UTF-8 in email
  addresses!


0.39     2015-08-04

- Changed Email::Abstract::Courriel's ->get_body() method to return the entire
  email as a string, making it equivalent to ->as_string(). This is confusing,
  but looking at the few instances of code in Email::Transport that call
  ->get_body(), it seems like that's what this method is expected to
  do. Reported by Greg Oschwald. RT #106176.


0.38     2015-08-04

- Somewhat screwy release now deleted from PAUSE.


0.37     2015-02-26

- Fixed a test failure when MooseX::Params::Validate 0.21+ is
  installed. Reported by Slaven Rezic. RT #102382.


0.36     2014-08-15

- Trying to build an email with a header that started with a space caused the
  header value to be dropped entirely from the generated email. Patch by Greg
  Oschwald. PR #2.


0.35     2014-05-12

- Replaced all uses of File::Slurp with File::Slurp::Tiny. See RT #95479 for
  the initial bug report and discussion on why File::Slurp should not be used.


0.34     2014-05-02

- More test fixes - relax the date parsing more.


0.33     2014-04-19

- Fixed tests so they pass with the most recent DateTime::Format::Mail (0.400)
  as well as older versions.


0.32     2014-04-19

- Courriel parsing is now more liberal and will accept an email with mixed
  line endings (some newline, some CRLF, etc.). Apparently this happens in the
  wild (of course it does). Reported by Joseph Crotty. RT #94837.


0.31     2013-04-03

[MISC]

- Removed the "this is very alpha" warning from the docs. It's really not very
  alpha any more.


0.30     2012-08-20

[API CHANGES]

- Courriel::Builder no longer exports a bcc() subroutine. Creating Bcc headers
  in emails does not make any sense whatsoever. See
  https://metacpan.org/module/Email::Sender::Manual::QuickStart#Hey-wheres-my-Bcc-support-
  for an explanation of why there is no such thing as a Bcc header.


0.29     2012-03-07

[BUG FIXES]

- Courriel now allows an email to have an empty subject when parsing, as does
  Courriel::Builder. Based on a patch from Zbigniew Łukasiak.


0.28     2012-02-01

[BUG FIXES]

- Header attribute names need to be looked up case-insensitively, according to
  the spec. The original casing is preserved in the Courriel::HeaderAttribute
  object's name(), method, but looking up an attribute by name on a
  Courriel::Header object now accepts any casing for the name.


0.27     2011-09-24

[ENHANCEMENTS]

- All objects which can stringify now support a ->stream_to API as well. This
  lets you stream their string output to a sub ref, filehandle, or an object
  with a ->print() method. If you are dealing with large emails, this API may
  be more efficient than generating a single string in memory.

[API CHANGES]

- Renamed the Header->as_header_string and HeaderAttribute->as_header_string
  methods to as_string, so that all objects have the same stringification API.


0.26     2011-09-19

[BUG FIXES]

- Add missing prereq for MooseX::Role::Parameterized. Reported by zby.


0.25     2011-09-15

[BUG FIXES]

- When a header value contained any non-ASCII content, Courriel would
  mistakenly MIME encode the whole value. In some cases, this is okay, but for
  some header fields it is wrong. For example, when a field contains an email
  address the actual address portion must be unencoded.


0.24     2011-09-13

[ENHANCEMENTS]

- The is_binary flag has been replaced with an is_character flag. This flag
  defaults to false. Suggested by zby.


0.23     2011-09-13

[ENHANCEMENTS]

- Courriel->parse now accepts an is_binary flag so you can pass decoded
  (utf-8) data as the email text. However, it's probably smarter to simply
  pass binary data to Courriel and let it do the decoding. The issue was
  brought up by zby.


0.22     2011-09-13

[BUG FIXES]

- Require List::MoreUtils 0.28+, as tests fail with earlier versions.

- Added missing prereq on File::Slurp.


0.21     2011-09-12

[API CHANGES]

- The ->get_attribute() method for Courriel::ContentType and ::Disposition
  objects was replaced by ->attribute in 0.20.

[ENHANCEMENTS]

- Added a new ->get_values() method to Courriel::Headers. This lets you get
  the header string values directly.

- Added a new ->attribute_value() for Courriel::Header::ContentType and
  ::Disposition. This lets you get the attribute's string value, if the
  attribute exists. Suggested by zby.

[BUG FIXES]

- The previous release documented a method ->get_attribute() for
  Courriel::Header::ContentType and ::Disposition objects. This method was
  removed in 0.20 and replaced with a method named ->attribute().


0.20     2011-09-11

[API CHANGES]

- The way headers are represented has been changed quite a bit
  internally. Read on for details.

  All headers are now represented as Courriel::Header objects instead of plain
  strings. This means that calling $headers->get('Foo') returns objects. To
  get the value, you need to call ->value on the individual objects.

  See Courriel::Header for the new class for headers.

- As a corrolary, the Courriel::ContentType and Courriel::Disposition classes
  have been renamed to Courriel::Header::ContentType and
  Courriel::Header::Disposition. They are both now subclasses of
  Courriel::Header. The APIs of these classes have remained mostly the same,
  except for attribute handling (see below).

  The old classes are still shipped in the distro, but they die when
  loaded. This avoids leaving behind old modules which no longer work with
  newer versions of Courriel.

  Methods which returned the old object now return the new one. The
  Courriel::Headers class will return the appropriate object when the header
  is fetched with $headers->get().

- Header attributes for the Content-Type and Content-Disposition object are
  now represented as Courriel::HeaderAttribute objects. This is necessary
  because these attributes may contain information about their character set
  and language, per RFC2231.

[ENHANCEMENTS]

- Header attributes with character set and language data per RFC2231 are now
  parsed properly. Reported by zby. RT #70801.

- Header attribute parsing is much laxer and will not die on bad attributes
  syntax (in most cases). It simply stops parsing and ignores bad data.


0.19     2011-08-21

- Fixed some test failures with older versions of Test::More, which stringify
  objects passed to is() rather than using their overloading. Reported by
  Maximilian Gaß. RT #70395.

- The Courriel::Disposition methods which return DateTime objects now
  explicitly set the time zone of the objects to UTC before returning it.


0.18     2011-08-20

- More improvements in handling broken email based on jwang's corpus of broken
  messages.

- Courriel tries a lot harder to find a date for the email. It now looks at
  all the Received headers, and it also uses DateTime::Format::Natural to
  parse dates if DateTime::Format::Mail fails.

- Courriel handles the charset "unknown-8bit" (by ignoring it and treating it
  as ASCII).


0.17     2011-08-19

- Email parsing is now much more flexible, and throws fewer
  exceptions. Ultimately, it's likely that Courriel will never throw an
  exception from parsing, since email in the wild is often broken, and it's
  better to return something than just give up. Thanks to jwang of
  grokbase.com for providing a corpus of broken messages to test against.

- The Courriel->plain_body_part() and ->html_body_part() methods ignore the case
  of an attachment's mime type, per RFC 2045.

- The Courriel::ContentType->mime_type() method always returns a value in
  lower case, but it preserves the original casing when constructing a header
  value.


0.16     2011-07-21

- Add Courriel->from(), ->to(), and ->cc() methods.

- Skip another test which may fail on other people's machines, as
  File::LibMagic does not return consistent results on all machines.


0.15     2011-06-28

- Skip a test which may fail on other people's machines, as File::LibMagic
  does not return consistent results on all machines.


0.14     2011-06-25

- An email part with non-text content would still be treated as character data
  rather than binary data, and its Content-Type header would end up with a
  charset of us-ascii. This has been fixed, and now you must explicitly ask
  for a charset in the Content-Type header when creating a
  Courriel::ContentType object. Note that plain and html body parts created
  via Courriel::Builder are unaffected, since these always default to UTF-8 as
  the charset. Reported by ico. RT #69085.

- Added Courriel::ContentType->has_charset() and
  Courriel::ContentType->is_binary() methods.


0.13     2011-06-20

- A multipart email built with Courriel::Builder would have a broken
  Content-Type header, missing the required boundary attribute. Reported by
  ico. RT #68694.

- If you explicitly passed unencoded content when creating a part (which
  happens when using Courriel::Builder), that content would be modified so it
  had CRLF line endings. Now, such content is left untouched. Reported by
  ico. RT #68695.

- When passing encoded content to the Courriel::Part::Single constructor, the
  constructor used to modify the content so it had CRLF line endings. Now it
  is left alone.

- Note that if you're passing raw content to the Single constructor _and_
  setting the transfer encoding to 7bit, 8bit, or binary, then you'll end up
  with a noncomformant email. However, by default all raw content is base64
  encoded. It is strongly recommended that you pass raw content and let
  Courriel take care of the transfer encoding.


0.12     2011-06-07

[BUG FIXES]

- The value returned by Courriel::Part::Single->content() was not decoded to
  Perl's native utf-8 character set. Similarly, when encoding content for
  transfer, it was not first transformed to raw bytes.


0.11     2011-06-07

[BUG FIXES]

- Courriel::Builder now adds a "MIME-Version: 1.0" header to all emails it
  creates unless you explicitly set this header, which you probably shouldn't,
  since the only valid value is "1.0". This is a required header for MIME
  emails per RFC2045.


0.10     2011-06-07

[BUG FIXES]

- When parsing an email, the encoding attribute for parts was not set
  correctly, and ended up defaulting to 8bit for all parts. Now the encoding
  is set based on the part's Content-Transfer-Encoding header.


0.09     2011-06-06

[NEW FEATURES]

- This distro now ships a plugin for Email::Abstract, meaning you can use
  Courriel with Email::Sender.


0.08     2011-06-06

[API CHANGES]

- The content() and encoded_content() methods for Courriel::Part::Single now
  return strings, rather than references. This makes the typical use
  simpler. You can still get the reference directly by calling content_ref()
  and encoded_content_ref().

[BUG FIXES]

- Make sure that any Content-ID header set via Courriel::Builder is formatted
  properly (the id value should be wrapped in angle brackets).


0.07     2011-06-06

- Some tests were failing because File::LibMagic may return slightly different
  results on different systems (application/x-perl versus text/x-perl).


0.06     2011-06-05

- Add missing test prereq on File::Slurp.

- The clone_without_attachments() method could end up setting the wrong
  encoding when creating a new single part email.


0.05     2011-06-04

- The clone_without_attachments() method would die when calling on an email
  that contained both plain and html inline parts.


0.04     2011-06-04

- Add missing prereq on File::LibMagic (needed since 0.02).


0.03     2011-06-04

- The encoding parameter is now always set in a part's headers.


0.02     2011-06-04

- Added all_parts_matching() method to Courriel class.

- Added clone_without_attachments() method to Courriel class.

- The Courriel::Part::Single attribute raw_content has been renamed as
  encoded_content.

- The text_body_part() method is now called plain_body_part().

- The add() and unshift() methods in Courriel::Headers now accept only one
  value.

- Added Courriel::Headers->replace as a convenience method.

- A header with attributes (like Content-Type) can escape values inside a
  quoted string, like value="foo \" bar". Courriel wasn't unescaping these
  values.

- It is now possible to pass a Courriel::Disposition object explicitly when
  constructing a Courriel::Part::Single object. The docs said this was
  possible in 0.01, but the parameter was just ignored.

- If a part is created with an explicit content_type and/or disposition
  object, the part's headers will be updated so that the Content-Type and
  Content-Disposition match the given object.

- The boundary for a Multipart part and the boundary in its ContentType's
  attributes will always be the same.

- All classes now use MooseX::StrictConstructor.

- Some hacks to make it possible for Courriel to play nice with
  Email::Abstract.

- Fixed some small doc errors.


0.01     2011-05-31

- First release upon an unsuspecting world.
