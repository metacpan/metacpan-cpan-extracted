NAME
       MacOSX::File - A collection of modules to manipulate files
       on MacOS X

TIGER
       As of Mac OS X v10.4 (Tiger), most of these operations with
       resource fork are supported by the ordinary (cp|mv|rsync).
       If you are looking for psync, you may as well consider using
       rsync -E instead.

DESCRIPTION
       MacOSX::File is a collection of modules that allows you to
       do what binaries in  /Developer/Tools allows you to do
       directly via perl.  You can implement your own CpMac,
       MvMac, GetFileInfo and SetFile without calling these bina-
       ries.

Subroutines defined in MacOSX::File itself
       Others are defined in other submodules.  see SUBMODULES
       below.

       EXPORT

       by default: unlink(), strerr()

       on request: $OSErr, $CopyErr

       unlink(@files)
           Just like CORE::unlink, deletes a list of files.
           Returns the number of files successfully deleted.  In
           addition to that, MacOSX::File::unlink also attempts
           to delete '._' files, files used in UFS volume to
           store Finder attributes and Resouce fork.

             $cnt = unlink 'a', 'b', 'c'; # deletes 'a', 'b', 'c'
                                          # and     '._a', '._b', '._c'
                                          # and returns 3 if all of them are
                                          # unlinked

       strerr()
           Return string representation of File Manager errors if
           any.  See MacOSX::File::Constants for details.

SUBMODULES
         MacOSX::File::Catalog    - Gets/Sets FSCatalogInfo Attributes
         MacOSX::File::Copy       - copy/move with HFS(+) attributes
         MacOSX::File::Info       - Gets/Sets File Attributes (Subset of ::Catal
og)
         MacOSX::File::Spec       - Gets FSSpec Structure

SCRIPTS
         pcpmac     - CpMac reimplemented
         pmvmac     - MvMac reimplemented
         pgetfinfo  - GetFileInfo reimplemented
         psetfinfo  - SetFile reimplemented
         psync      - update copy utility, very reason I wrote this module

       To install this module, first make sure Developer kit is
       installed.  Then type the following:

          perl Makefile.PL
          make
          make test
