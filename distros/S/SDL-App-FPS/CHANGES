Revision history for SDL::App::FPS:

2006-02-27 v0.21 Tels - 310 tests
  * make to work with SDL_perl 1.2.3:
    + resizing didn't work anymore
    + costant exporting was borked, needs "use SDL;" not "use SDL::Event;"
  * bundle Module::Install
  * remove the NEW file
  * fix tests failing due to timer problems
  * fix XS code:
    + remove unused RETVAL from _delay()
    + avoid warnings about unused params, rename "class" to "myclass"
  * option "show_fps" is really "show_fps" (not "showfps")
  * fix speling and nits in doc
  * use better tagline for CPAN indexing
  * include examples/lib/SDL/OpenGL/Cube.pm since normal SDL misses it
  * Mandelbroth example:
    + modify the title to show % done
    + re-use a SDL::Color object for more speed

Older revision history:

2002-12-25 v0.01 Tels - 3 tests (not released)
 * rewrote test.pl into package SDL::App::FPS complete with doc and a testfile
 * features:
   - option handling
   - framerate monitor
   - time warp (slow motion, fast forward, even clock going backwards)
   - event handling after each frame
   - framerate cap, with sophisticated delay to acocunt for timer inaccuracies
   - object oriented approach, subclassable
 * added sample subclass and testfile

2002-12-26 v0.02 Tels - 8 tests (15:30)
 * added $VERSION
 * made into a proper package for easier handling
 * added quit() to quit application from draw_frame() or anywhere else
 * added fullscreen() (still needs some work)
 * added can_ok() test to test for methods to exist
 * added tests for pre_init_handler(), post_init_handler() and quit_handler()
 * added test for framerate cap
 * require SDL version 1.18.0 (since 1.19.x is not yet on CPAN)
 * added ramp_time_warp(), stop_time_warp_ramp()
 * added freeze_time(), thaw_time()

2002-12-26 v0.03 Tels - 11 tests (19:50)
 * added time_is_frozen(), time_is_ramping()
 * added pause() to pause application until some or an specific event occured
   (the SDL_QUIT event will always end the pause and then the application)
 * added examples/ with Kcirb.pl and subclass for it
 * main loop ends when $self->{quit} is true, to avoid hanging at end when
   there are no more events
 * moved post_init_handler() after initializing $self->{now} et al.
 * renamed update() to next_frame() and added update() to call {app}->update()
 * added app(), width() and height()
 * added min_fps(), max_fps()
 * added min_frame_time(), max_frame_time()

2002-12-26 v0.04 Tels - 41 tests (22:35) 
 * moved bugs from TODO to BUGS
 * the event we wait in pause() for is put to handle_event(), too.
 * added support for timers via SDL::App::FPS::Timer and add_timer(),
   get_timer(), remove_timer(), timers() as well as expire_timers()
 * added a timer example to the example application, it now spawns a new
   rectangle every 3 seconds.
 * re-ordered METHODS in FPS.pm: move the automatically used methods to bottom
 * added tests for Timer.pm

2002-12-27 v0.05 Tels - 50 tests (1.35) 
 * timers can have additional arguments to callback, test for them
 * timers allow negative target time and negative delay time
 * fixed: add_timer() really add timer, instead of replacing the first one
 * timer take a 'rand' argument to randomize their times (not used yet)
 * pass overshot value to timer callback
 * fixed README
 * don't start time warp ramp if we are already at the target warp
 * randomize rectangle sizes in example application
 * add "shots" to example application (shows nested timers with overshot
   correction!)
 * added key 'b' to example application, wait for some action, then try it!

2002-12-27 v0.06 Tels - 50 tests (23:43)
 * coded the delay() routine in XS, so that the example app only spents about
   4% of it's time in next_frame(), not 12%.
 * remember timer's next $next_check so as to not check them too often
   (example app saves a few % by calling expire_timers() only about half as
   much as in v0.05)
 * disable next_time_check when adding or removing timers (w/ nesting)
 * optimized the example application to cache the SDL::rect objects for each
   rectangle. While capping at 40 fps it uses about 50% CPU, even when there
   are about 40 rectangles on the screen. v0.05 would start using 100% CPU
   starting from only 20 or so rectangles onwards.

2002-12-28 v0.07 Tels - 70 tests
 * Changed the event handling framework:
   added add_event_handler(), SDL::App::FPS::EventHandler (with new(),
    rebind(), check()), and del_event_handler().
   Overriding handle_event() no longer necc., removed handle_event(), and
   changed example app to use this.
 * timer check that rand value is smaller than abs(time) and abs(delay)
 * wiggle timer time and delay based on rand value
 * added in_fullscreen() to check current fullscreen status
 * fullscreen() takes argument to switch to fullscreen or windowed mode
   (instead just toggling) and returns current status
 * tests for random timers and fullscreen stuff
 * added a big section on why, how, time warp, ramping, event handlers and
   timers to the pod in SDL::App::FPS
 * renamed remove_timer() to del_timer() and documented it
 * tests for del_timer()
 * fixed get_timer() and test for it
 * renamed example application to "demo"

2002-12-29 v0.08 Tels - 76 tests
 * optimized next_frame():
   - calc $frame_diff was unnecc.
   - shifted a bit more code to XS (calc of new wake_time)
   When doing an empty loop (with max_fps set to 500), v0.07 was able to do
   about 11000 FPS, v0.08 manages about 23000. (1 Ghz AMD)
 * if max_fps == 0, set it to at least 1
 * set max_fps to 500 at most (anything above 300 will result in no cap at
   all, currently)
 * fixed EventHandler::check: don't check if event is inactive

2003-01-01 v0.09 Tels - 109 tests
 * added activate(), deactivate(), is_active() to Timer.pm
 * added SDL::FPS::App::Group.
 * added example on how to sort event handlers in groups, and enable, disable
   them in batches
 * added a test for timer not beeing due when time_warp == 0 (time frozen)
 * tests for new timer features and group
 * encapsulate all data of base class SDL::App::FPS inside $self->{_app}
 * EventHandler callback can carry additional arguments
 * added mandel.pl to examples

2003-01-02 v0.10 Tels - 111 tests
 * nit: fixed =NAME to contain 'SDL' for indexing
 * PREREQ SDL_perl v1.19.2 since it is now on CPAN
 * added LICENSE and CREDITS
 * added SDL::App::FPS::depth()
 * depth(), height() and width() return cached values for more speed
 * fixed: create_window() ignored the user options and always used 640x480x24
 * fixed to mandel.pl:
   + fixed and enabled the recursive algorithmn in mandel.pl (takes 48 sec
     instead 154 sec on 1 Ghz AMD for first image, even better when zoomed in)
   + fixed time output in mandel.pl, dump some debug output and coordinates
   + zooming in while recursive calc was underway resulted in corruption
   + toggle method: 1 (iterative), 2 (recursive), 3 (recursive with prefill)

2003-01-04 v0.11 Tels - 164 tests
 SDL::App::FPS::Thingy:
  * added, made Timer, Group, EventHandler and Button use it as base class
 SDL::App::FPS::EventHandler:
  * cater for SDL_VIDEORESIZE events
  * upon rebind, call $app->_rebound_event_handler()
  * is now able to watch for 1,2 or 3 different mousebuttons with the same
    handler (pass BUTTON_MOUSE_LEFT + BUTTON_MOUSE_RIGHT for instance)
  * removed LEFTMOUSEBUTTON, RIGHTMOUSEBUTTON and MIDDLEMOUSEBUTTON
 SDL::App::FPS::Button:
  * added, use Thingy
  * rectangular, circular or elliptic shapes
  * watches for mouse in, out, hover, button down/up or click events
 SDL::App::FPS::Group:
  * use Thingy
  * activate()/deactivate() calls activate()/deactivate() of each member
 SDL::App::FPS:
 * event_handler() no longer exists, so don't use nor document it
 * pause() throws away events
 * internal methods prefixed with '_'
 * added support for option -resizeable
   + add event for SDL_VIDEORESIZE and adjusting width/height in _resized()
 * added _rebound_event_handler()
 * added BUTTON_MOUSE_LEFT, BUTTON_MOUSE_RIGHT, BUTTON_MOUSE_MIDDLE
 * added resize_handler() 
 mandel.pl:
  * rewrote mandel's recursive algorithmn to be simpler, also fixed a bug that
     it calculated/draw one pixel too much for every hor/vert. line
  * fixed the bug in recursive alg. that left 'holes'
  * use watch_event(), support resizable (restart calc upon resize)
  * reset point counter when starting new calculation
  * use recursive method as default
 demo.pl:
  * use watch_event(), supports resizable (automatically)
 empty.pl:
  * use watch_event(), support resizable (automatically)
 event.pl:
  * use watch_event(), support resizable (automatically)
 button.pl and MyButt.pm:
  * added a simple click'n'kill game to show SDL::App::FPS::Button usage

2003-01-05 v0.12 Tels - 190 tests
 Library:
  * fixed all the outstandind issues with Button, all combinations now work
  * added: BUTTON_DOWN and BUTTON_UP (for BUTTON_RELEASED and BUTTON_PRESSED)
  * documented add_button() in FPS.pm
  * added SDL::App::FPS::Color inclusive tests
  * fixed stupid definition bug in BUTTON_MOUSE_*
 Demos:
  * added mouse.pl and MyMouse.pm to show off advanced Button features
  * added color.pl and MyColor.pm to show off colors
  * mandel.pl shows percentage of already done area in recursive mode
  * fixed event.pl (I know I should try things before releasing them..)

2003-01-12 v0.13 Tels - 229 tests
 Library:
 fixed: 
  * Color.pm: darken()s factor was accid. inverted (now 0..1 instead of 1..0)
  * use 'unsigned int' instead of 'int' in XS code
  * Timer.pm: callback no longer get's timer id (please change your code!)
  * FPS: timers 'fire' now in the order in which they expire (e.g. the most
    overdue timer first, then the next etc, instead of the one with the lowest
    ID first)
  * FPS: timers now fire multiple times in one frame (w/ diff. overdue values)
 added:
  * Color.pm: added blend()
  * way more tests for Color.pm
  * added two color ramps (linaer, sinus) to colors.pl to show blending/mixing
  * FPS.pm: save() and load()
  * FPS: base_ticks to adjust now(), allows load() to 'reset' the time to what
    it was when the save() occured
  * XS: keep wake_time, no need to carry it from/to Perl: 24,000 FPS empty
  * XS: monitor framerate instead in Perl: about 31000 FPS empty
  * min_fps() and max_fps() in XS
  * min_frame_time() and max_frame_time() in XS: now about 34000 FPS empty
  * FPS.pm: added resize() method to manually resize window
  * Timer.pm: added is_due() and fire() to seperate these two steps
  * Eventhandler: char2key() - convert char to SDLK_foo
  * Eventhandler: support for key additional (all, none) modifiers 
 Demos:
 fixed:
  * mouse.pl: MyMouse uses Color.pm
 added:
  * added examples/boulder/ - a simple game in a cave, showing resizing w/
    min. window size, keeping a playfield with a fog-o-war
  * added examples/keycheck.pl to show event handlers with key modifiers 

2003-01-23 v0.14 Tels - 255 tests
 mandel.pl
  * optimized MyMandel.pm's _mandel_point() a bit (43 instead of 45 seconds)
  * re-use SDL::Color objects in draw_point() makes it about 15% faster
  * MyMandel.pm use Math::Fractal::Mandelbrot if possible (9 vs 42 seconds)
  * recolor the image by pressing one of: 'r', 'g', 'b', 'p' or 'y'
    (next image will be done with the newly set color preset)
 Library:
  * corrected Color.pm's =head1 NAME section to allow indexing in CPAN
  * Color.pm: desaturate($color,$r,$g,$b) - convert color to gray-scale
  * Color.pm: invert($color) - invert color
  * Group.pm: added $group->clear()
  * FPS.pm: added del_thing()
  * better subclass handling of timers, event handlers and buttons
  * pass $type to check() for about 25% faster event and button check/handling
  * sort event handlers into groups based on type and check only these
    that match the current event. So mouse move handlers don't get activated
    for keydown events etc. No functional change, just faster.
  * Thingy.pm calls $app->_activated_thing($self) and
    $app->_deactivated_thing($self) to allow app to sort handlers etc into
    active and inactive ones (e.g. inactive event handlers are no longer
    called to check occuring events => slightly faster if you have lot's of
    inactive ones)
  * Thingy: don't (de)activate() if Thingy is already (in)active
  * corrected bug in timer firing introduced by timer expiring optimization
  * workaround bug in SDL::Event.pm that crashes us when using KMOD_foo

2003-03-02 v0.15 Tels - 265 tests
  * added example opengl.pl which shows OpenGL usage
  * FPS.pm: support for "gl" switch
	    added get_clock(), set_clock() and clock_to_ticks()
  * Thingy: has field name (w/ default) and accessor method name()
  * Group: method named(), returning one or more matching members by that name

2003-03-10 v0.16 Tels - 265 tests
  * document the Group->named() method
  * opengl example: fix secondary rotation (instead of secondary wiggling)
  * added modelview example: show MD2 models using Games::3D::Model
            
2003-03-12 v0.17 Tels - 265 tests
  * removed modelview from distribution: see http://bloodgate.com/perl/sdl
  * max_fps == 0 disables framerate cap (for benchmarks)
  * removed obsolete cap_fps parameter

2003-03-21 v0.18 Tels - 265 tests
  * made compatible to SDL_perl 1.20.2 (actually, nothing had to be done :)
  * The mandel fractal takes now 6.8 instead of 9.5 seconds, just be switching
    to SDL_perl 1.20.2 :-)

2003-03-23 v0.19 Tels - 306 tests
  * added config file support via Config::Simple (defaults to reading
    'config/client.cfg'), added parameter "config" to set the config file name
  * support for parsing command line options via GetOpt::Long
  * added: watch_event() knows 'screenshot'
  * fixed: $app->option() was broken because it accessed the wrong namespace
  * fixed: switching to fullscreen at new() didn't work since window didn't
           exist yet

2003-04-19 v0.20 Tels - 310 tests
  * forgot to include the config files for mandel and opengl - oups.
  * screenshots of OpenGL apps work now (needs SDL_perl v1.20.3)
  * added support for wheel mouse buttons (needs SDL_perl v1.20.3)
  * support for showing FPS (needs Games::OpenGL::Font::2D v0.05) 
  * support for console (needs Games::Console v0.02) 
  * added the following options:
    - show_fps
    - fps_font
    - console_font
    - debug
    - useconsole
  * reading in of config files describing a font (for fps and console),
    thus the same font-bitmap, with different colors and sizes can be used
  * fixed: option "name" is now known as "title", and really works (sets the
    window title of the application window)
  * when console is open, console receives keypresses instead of the app
  * config reading reads options from default or [app], plus [input] section
  * bind keys from config file (section [input]) to event handlers of the type
    FPS_EVENT, this means you can use in your code:
      $self->add_event_handler ( FPS_EVENT, 'some_event_name_here', ... );
    and it will still work when somebody changes the config file (which even
    your own app could do at runtime!)
  * added: event_bound_to() to find out which keys needs pressing for an event
  * fixed a bug in watch_event( pause => foo ); (didn't work)

Please send me test-reports, your experiences with this and your ideas - I love
to hear about my work!
