### NAME ###

Test::More::Behaviour - BDD module for Perl

### INSTALL ###

    $ cpan -i Test::More::Behaviour

### DESCRIPTION ###

Test::More::Behaviour is a Behaviour-Driven Development module for Perl
programmers.  It is modeled after [Rspec](http://rspec.info), the BDD tool for Ruby programmers.

Because Test::More::Behaviour uses Test::More as its 'base', you can treat every Test::More::Behaviour test as if it were Test::More!

### SYNOPSIS ###

#### basic structure ####

Test::More::Behaviour uses the words `describe` and `it` so we can
express concepts of the application as we would in conversation:

    "Describe a bank account."
    "It transfers money between two accounts."

code:

    describe 'Bank Account' => sub {
        it 'transfers money between two accounts' => sub {
            my $source = BankAccount->new(100);
            my $target = BankAccount->new(0);
            $source->transfer(50, $target);

            is($source->balance, 50);
            is($target->balance, 50);
        };
    };

Then the output should be:

    Bank Account
       transfers money between two accounts

The `describe` subroutine takes a description and a block. Inside the
block you can declare examples using the `it` subroutine.

#### nested groups ####

You can also declare nested groups using the  `describe` or `context`
subroutines.

    describe 'Bank Account' => sub {
        context 'when opening without an initial amount' => sub {
            it 'has an initial balance of 0' => sub {
                ...
            };
        };
        
        context 'when opening with an initial amount of 100' => sub {
            it 'has an initial balance of 100' => sub {
                ...
            };
        };
    };

### QUICK REFERENCE ###

This project is built with the philosophy that 'Tests are the
Documentation'.  For a full set of features, please read through the
test scenarios.

Some examples are listed with the [source code](https://github.com/bostonaholic/test-more-behaviour) under `examples/`.

#### describe ####

Used to group a set of examples of a particular behaviour of the
system that you wish you describe.

    describe 'Bank Account' sub => {
        ...
    };

#### it ####

An example to run.

    describe 'Bank Account' => sub {
        it 'transfers money between two accounts' => sub {
            ...
        };
    };

#### context ####

Used to further establish deeper relations for a set of examples.  This is best used when several examples have similar interactions with the system but have differring expectations.

    describe 'Bank Account' => sub {
        context 'when opening without an initial amount' => sub {
            it 'has an initial balance of 0' => sub {
                ...
            };
        };
        
        context 'when opening with an initial amount of 100' => sub {
            it 'has an initial balance of 100' => sub {
                ...
            };
        };
    };

#### before_all ####

#### after_all ####

These subroutines will run before and after all the `it` examples.

    sub before_all {
        ...
    };
    
    sub after_all {
        ...
    };

    describe 'Bank Account' => sub {
        it 'transfers money between two accounts' => sub {
            ...
        };
    };

#### before_each ####

#### after_each ####

Used to define code which executes before and after each `it` example.

    sub before_each {
        ...
    };
    
    sub after_each {
        ...
    };

    describe 'Bank Account' => sub {
        it 'transfers money between two accounts' => sub {
            ...
        };
    };

### BUGS AND LIMITATIONS ###

Currently, each `it` will not run as a Test::More::subtest.  This is because the coloring was not working correctly because subtest needed the description before evaluating the block passed in.  If you can fix this, please submit a github pull request and I will take a look.

If you do find any bugs, please send me an email or create a
[Github Issue](https://github.com/bostonaholic/test-more-behaviour/issues)
or pull request with a failing test (and your fix if you're able to) and I will be more than happy to fix.
