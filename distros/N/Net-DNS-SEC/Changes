***0.16 March 12, 2010

   Feature: KEY inherits DNSKEY
   This helps maintenance in one part of the code.

   Feature: keylength method (rt.cpan.org #53468)
   Added keylength method for RSA and DSA
   Acknowledgements Hugo Salgado

   Acknowledgement Jakob Shlyter

   Fix: rt.cpan.org #42089
   NSEC3 Algorithm support in NSEC3 broken
   patch by Wes Hardaker


***0.15 December 31, 2008


   Fix: digestbin not set when an empty value passed to hash.

   Feature: Added DLV (rfcc 4431). The RR object is simply a clone of
   the DS RR and inherits ... everything

   Feature: Added NSEC3 and NSEC3PARAM support (RFC5155). 
   This adds Mime::Base32 to the module dependency list. 
   The RR type was still experimental at that time and is maintained
   in Net::DNS::RR.

   Fix: Test script recognizes change in Time::Local. Note that
   Time::Local does not deal with dates beyond 03:14:07 UTC on
   Tuesday, 19 January 2038. Therefore this code has a year 2038 
   problem.

   Fix: DS create_from_hash now produces objects that can create
   wireformat.

   Other: minor changes to the debug statements
          added t/05-rr.t (and identified a couple of bugs using it)

   Fix: a few inconsistencies with respect to parsing of trailing dots.


   During development the test signatures generated with the BIND tools
   were re-generated in order to troubleshoot a bug that (most
   probably) was caused by a version incompatibility between Net::DNS
   and Net::DNS::SEC.  Before release the original test from the 0.14
   release were ran against this version too.
   

 

0.14 February 14, 2005

   FIX: The introducion of the keytag warning triggered a bug with RSAMD5
        keys, causing RSAMD5 keys not to be loaded. 



0.13 December 9, 2005 

   FEAT: rt.cpan.org 14588

        Added support for passing (a reference to) an array of keys to the
	RRSIG verify function.

   FIX/FEAT:
	The Net::DNS::SEC::Private function will for RSA based keys verify if
	the keytag in the filename is actually correct.
	Since at parsing the value of the DNSKEY RR flags is not known we
	test against the currently defined flag values 256 and 257.

	If we cannot find a keytag match a warning is printed and Private
	key generation fails

        This inconsistency was spotted by Jakob Shlyter.
	

   FEAT: Added support for SHA256 to the DS RR. Assigned the expected 
        digest type2 for SHA256 type hashes.
	
        Note that this makes the Net::DNS::SEC depend on Digest::SHA instead
        of Digest::SHA1.

        The default digest type is still set to 1.

        NB. The code makes assumptions about the IANA assignment of the 
            digest type. The assignment may change. Do not use SHA256 in 
	    production zones!!

   FIX: rt.cpan.org #15662

	Roy Arends noticed and patched the label counting did not ignore
        an initial asterisk label.

   FIX: Wes Hardaker noticed the default TTL values for created signatures to
        be different from the TTLs from the data that is being signed.

   FIX: Wes Hardaker reported there was a problem with validating
        RRsets that had ownernames with capitals.
	The fix depends on a fix in Net::DNS::RR that is available in
	version 0.53_03 or later of the Net::DNS distribution.


  FEAT: Propper dealing with mnemonics for algorithm and digest type
	added to DS

  FIX/FEAT: Mnemonics were written as RSA/MD5 and RSA/SHA1. This has been
        corrected tp RSASHA1 and RSAMD5, as in the IANA registry.
	

0.12_02 June 6, 2005 (beta 2 release for 0.13)

   Bug: new_from_hash would not correctly create the RR since internally
	typebm is used to store the data this has been fixed so that
        the following works

        Net::DNS::RR->new(name=>$name,
                    ttl=>$ttl,
                    type=>"NSEC",
                    nxtdname=>$nxtdname,
                    typelist=>join(" ",@types)
                   );


   FEAT: Introduced the "use bytes" pragma to force character interpretation
         of all the scalars. Any utf processing by perl makes the code behave
         unpredictable.

0.12_01 April 18, 2005. (beta release for version 0.13)

   FEAT (!!!): Changed the symantics of the Net::DNS::Keyset::verify method.
	 Read the perldoc for details. The requirement that each key in a 
         keyset has to be selfsigned has been loosened.

   FEAT: Added a "carp" to the new methods of the NXT RR. Warning that
	 that record is deprecated.

   FEAT: Cleaned the tests so that RRSIG and DNSKEY are used except for 
         SIG0 based tests.

   FEAT: Changed the name of the siginceptation[SIC] to siginception.
	 Thanks Jakob Schlyter for notifying me of this mistyping.
	 An alias for the method remains available. 	


   FEAT: Renamed unset_sep() to clear_sep().


   NOTE: To avoid confusion the Net::DNS::SIG::Private class has been
         removed. Use Net::DNS::SEC::Private!

   DOC:  Added references to RFC 4033, RFC 4034 and RFC 4035. Rewrote parts
         of the perlpod.
   



0.12 June 2004 "DNSSEC-bis Release"

   FEAT: Added utility function key_difference() to Net::DNS::SEC. See
         perlpod for details. I needed this in other software and
         figured they are generic enough to make them available
         through this module.

   FEAT: Modified some functions to use DNSKEY and RRSIG instead off
         KEY and SIG.
         - Net::DNS::Keyset now uses DNSKEY and RRSIG.
	 - the demo function getkeyset.pl now uses DNSKEY too.
 
   FEAT: Added the possibility to create a keyset out of two arrays of
         dnskey and rrsig object.
         

   FEAT: Added some helperfunctions to Net::DNS::SEC::Private to read X509 
         formated private keys and dump them into bind format.
	 This functionality has not been tested well.

   BUG : When reading a RRSIG from a packet the signame would not have
         a trailing dot.


0.11_4  Apr 24 2004 Development snapshot.

   BUG: - Fixed MANIFEST.

   FEAT:  Removed critical dependency on bubblebabble. It is available to 
          DS if installed but not critically dependend.


0.11_3  Mar 4 2004 Development snapshot.

   BUG: - Fixed minor in signing unknown RR types.

0.11_2  Jan 27 2004 Development snapshot.

   FEAT: - Prelimanary support for draft-ietf-dnssec-nsec-rdata-02. This
	   depends on support for unknown RR types (Net::DNS version
           0.44) 
   

0.11_1  Sep 23 2003 Development snapshot.

   FEAT: - To be able to deal with argument supplied as either mnemonics or
           by value the Net::DNS::SEC::argument method was created. It can
           be used as a class method but it is also inherited by
	   Net::DNS::RR::RRSIG and Net::DNS::RR::DNSKEY.


0.11 August 28 2003

   FEAT: - Implemented draft-ietf-dnsext-dnssec-2535typcode-change-04.txt 
           This document has been through review and will be published
           as standard track RFCs shortly. (Publsished as RFC3755).
           IMPORTANT: the implementation of the typecode roll deprecated 
           the use of SIG->create for any other reason than SIG0. If
           you try to create SIGs over RRsets you will be warned.

   FEAT: - Modified the namespace for the module that holds the name
           of the private key from Net::DNS::RR::SIG::Private to 
           Net::DNS::SEC::Private.  
           !!!!!
           Net::DNS::RR::SIG::Private will be deprecated in a next release.
           !!!!!


   CLEAN:- Crypt::OpenSSL::RSA v 0.19 introduced the possibility to
           create keys directly from parameters, although this introduced
           a dependency on Crypt::OpenSSL::Bignum it allowed to get rid
           from converting all parameters to DER/ANS1 encoding. Got rid of 
           a number of lines of code.


0.10 January 8 2003

   BUG:  - Crypt::OpenSSL::RSA::new method has been deprecated. Code has
	   been modified to deal with the new constructors

0.09 January 6 2003

   FEAT: - Added Net::DNS::RR::SIG::Private. The class provides 
           an abstraction to the private key material. The SIG create
	   method now either takes a filename, like previously, or a 
	   Private key object as an argument. If you have to create
	   many signatures the latter is preferred because you only have
	   to read the file with the private key material once.
	   
	   Note that by adding this feature a modification to
	   Net::DNS::Resolver was needed to properly do SIG0.  Use
	   Net::DNS version 0.32 or later in combination with this
	   version

   FEAT: - Wes Griffen added a parameter change to keyset:

  	   'Attached is a diff for Net::DNS::SEC v0.8 that adds a
	   parameter changes keyset->writekeyset($path) to
	   keyset->writekeyset($prefix,$path) where prefix is an
	   optional string that is prepended to the filename of the
	   keyset. That way I can keep my unsigned keyset in
	   keyset-<domain>. and have the signed keyset in
	   signed-keyset-<domain>.'


   FEAT: - Babblebubble, handy for telephone confirmation of hashes.
           Added babblebubble string as comment to DS RR.
           DS->babble returns the babble bubble string
  

   FEAT: - Miek Gieben contributed demo/key2ds


0.08 November 4 2002

   BUG:  - DSA signature verification failed at random about 1 per 10
           sigatures. Corrected allignment problem that lead to this.
	   Added 'stresstest' that loops over creation and verification
	   of signatures to spot these kind of seldomly occuring errors.
          
           On my VAIO PII 500Mhz the take about a minute:
 	   Files=3, Tests=3056, 69 wallclock secs 
                               (63.30 cusr +  0.70 csys = 63.99 CPU)


   FEAT: - Added Test::More as dependency as on some systems diag was failing.


0.07 October 2 2002

   FEAT: - Added demo/make-signed-keyset, a contribution by Wes Griffin.

   FEAT: - Removed dependency on Math::Pari by porting away from
	   Crypt::DSA to Crypt::OpenSSL::DSA (version 0.10). This should
	   increase portability over platform.

           T.J. Mather, the Crypt::OpenSSL::DSA maintainer has been
	   particularly helpfull and responsive by adding a few
	   methods to the DSA modules.

0.06 August 16 2002

   NOTE: In one of ther versions prior to Net::DNS 0.26 a bug
         got introduced that made Net::DNS::SEC break. The bug was fixed in
	 version 0.27.

   BUG:  - Check on the existence of the private file improved in SIG.pm

         - signame got trailing dot with the create methods and not with
	   others.

   FEAT: - Added privatekeyname method to KEY.pm
         - Started work on Net::DNS::Keyset.
         - Added RSA/SHA1 (algorithm ID 5) to SIG.pm. Patch supplied by
	   Andy Vaskys,  Network Associates Laboratories.
	 - Rewrote regexp's to not use $' (Postmatch).

0.05 and 0.04 June 17, 2002

    BUG:  Makefile.PL needed a fix for unused dependency. This failed
	  made the installation fail :-(. 0.04 introduced another failing
	  dependency.

    DOC:  Clarified the documentation at points. 



0.03 June 14, 2002
   
    DOC: Few Clarifications

0.02 June 4, 2002

    First CPAN Release.
    Some modifications to the packaging.


0.01 May 25, 2002  

    Version 0.01 of the package is an alpha for CPAN release.



---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The extensions used to be published as a modified version of
Net::DNS. The history of those is documented below.

0.20-DNSSEC-0.2:
  
  Branched off Net::DNS version 0.20 release (CPAN May 15, 2002)


0.20-DNSSEC-0.1:

  This version had limited distribution
  
  First patch against a version 0.20 snapshot (2002-03-27).
  http://www.dyndns.org/~ctriv/net-dns-snaps/2002/03/


  Modified t/09-dnssec.t; uses Test::More now and includes a number of
  self consistency checks.
 

  DOC   Cleaned up the documentation and removed some references to functions
	and libraries that where not used anyway.

  FIX   'aesthetic' patch supplied by Simon Josefsson reordering the NXT
        RR map for the  print  method.
 
  FEAT  Added checks on keytype and updated to latest specs for DS 
        Added SIG0 support. See Net::DNS::Packet for details. The verify and
	create methods of SIG.pm where modified somewhat to cope with the 
	difference.
        Changed RSA backend from Crypt::RSA to Crypt::OpenSSL::RSA because
	Crypt::RSA failed during a 'loss of Math::Pari precision in 
	Crypt::Primes'.
  

0.19-DNSSEC-0.5: 

  BUG   DS create method: Hash calculation was done over concatenation of name
        and key material while the hash should be taken over concatenation of
        canonical name and key rdata. (Fix by Mike Schiraldi)


0.19-DNSSEC-0.4: 
  Added CERT support: Courtesy of Mike Schiraldi <raldi@research.netsol.com> 
        for VeriSign
 
  BUG Fixed MANIFEST file. make dist will result in proper module tar ball
 

0.19-DNSSEC-0.3: 
  Solved patch problems that where due to the $ Id $ in headers not 
  being from the original distribution.

  Added DSA signature creation

  Added DS support 
        You have to uncomment line 77 in Net/DNS.pm to fully enable DS
	This will assign QTYPE 93 to the DS RR.
	That value is not assigned by IANA. 


  Added this README.DNSSEC file

  Added t/09-dnssec.t to the test script with a number of consistency checks.
        after patching the original distribution direction
        perl Makefile.PL
        make test 
        will call this function among other things.

  BUG   KeyID set to 0 for null keys.

  BUG   Sorting of canonical RDATA; 
	Data over which SIG was created was not sorted properly (RFC2535 
        sect 8.3) causing signature verification errors for RDATA within 
	a RRset having different length (e.g. some NS RRsets would not 
	verify.)

0.19-DNSSEC-0.2: 
  First somewhat public release.
