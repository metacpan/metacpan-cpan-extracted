NAME

    App::Jiffy - A minimalist time tracking app focused on precision and
    effortlessness.

SYNOPSIS

      use App::Jiffy;
    
      # cmd line tool
      jiffy Solving world hunger
      jiffy Cleaning the plasma manifolds
      jiffy current # Returns the elapsed time for the current task
    
      # Run server
      jiffyd
      curl -d "title=Meeting with Client X" http://localhost:3000/timeentry

DESCRIPTION

    App::Jiffy's philosophy is that you should have to do as little as
    possible to track your time. Instead you should focus on working.
    App::Jiffy also focuses on precision. Many times time tracking results
    in globbing activities together masking the fact that your 5 hours of
    work on project "X" was actually 3 hours of work with interruptions
    from your coworker asking about project "Y".

    In order to be precise with as little effort as possible, App::Jiffy
    will be available via a myriad of mediums and devices but will have a
    central server to combine all the information. Plans currently include
    the following applications:

    Command line tool

    Web app App::Jiffyd

    iPhone app ( potentially )

INSTALLATION

      curl -L https://cpanmin.us | perl - git://github.com/lejeunerenard/jiffy

METHODS

    The following are methods available on the App::Jiffy object.

 add_entry

    add_entry will create a new TimeEntry with the current time as the
    entry's start_time.

 current_time

    current_time will print out the elapsed time for the current task (AKA
    the time since the last entry was created).

 time_sheet

    time_sheet will print out a time sheet including the time spent for
    each TimeEntry.

 search( $query_text, $days )

    The search subcommand will look for the given $query_text in the past
    $days number of days. It will treat the $query_text argument as a
    regex.

 run

    run will start an instance of the Jiffy app.
