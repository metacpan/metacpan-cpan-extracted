NAME

    Test::Mock::Time - Deterministic time & timers for event loop tests

VERSION

    This document describes Test::Mock::Time version v0.1.7

SYNOPSIS

      use Test::Mock::Time;
    
      # All these functions will return same constant time
      # until you manually move time forward by some deterministic
      # value by sleep(), ff() or doing one tick of your event loop.
      say time();
      say localtime();
      say gmtime();
      say Time::HiRes::time();
      say Time::HiRes::gettimeofday();
      say Time::HiRes::clock_gettime(CLOCK_REALTIME());
      say Time::HiRes::clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC());
    
      # All these functions will fast-forward time (so time() etc.
      # will return increased value on next call) and return immediately.
      # Pending timers of your event loop (if any) will not be processed.
      sleep(1);
      Time::HiRes::sleep(0.5);
      Time::HiRes::usleep(500_000);
      Time::HiRes::nanosleep(500_000_000);
      Time::HiRes::clock_nanosleep(500_000_000);
    
      # This will fast-forward time and process pending timers (if any).
      ff(0.5);
    
      # These will call ff() in case no other (usually I/O) event happens in
      # $Test::Mock::Time::WAIT_ONE_TICK seconds of real time and there are
      # some active timers.
      Mojo::IOLoop->one_tick;
      EV::run(EV::RUN_ONCE);

DESCRIPTION

    This module replaces actual time with simulated time everywhere (core
    time(), Time::HiRes, EV, AnyEvent with EV, Mojolicious, …) and provide
    a way to write deterministic tests for event loop based applications
    with timers.

    IMPORTANT! This module must be loaded by your script/app/test before
    other related modules (Time::HiRes, Mojolicious, EV, etc.).

EXPORTS

    These functions are exported by default:

        ff

INTERFACE

 WAIT_ONE_TICK

        $Test::Mock::Time::WAIT_ONE_TICK = 0.05;

    This value is used to limit amount of real time spend waiting for
    non-timer (usually I/O) event while one tick of event loop if there are
    some active timers. In case no events happens while this time event
    loop will be interrupted and time will be fast-forward to time when
    next timer should expire by calling ff().

 ff

        ff( $seconds );
        ff();

    Fast-forward current time by $seconds (can be fractional). All
    functions like time() will returns previous value increased by $seconds
    after that.

    Will run callbacks for pending timers of your event loop if they'll
    expire while $seconds or if they've already expired (because you've
    used functions like sleep() which fast-forward time without processing
    timers).

    When called without params will fast-forward time by amount needed to
    run callback for next pending timer (it may be 0 in case there are no
    pending timers or if next pending timer already expired).
