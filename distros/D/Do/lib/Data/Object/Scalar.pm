Data::Object::Scalar

=cut

=head1 ABSTRACT

Data-Object Scalar Class

=cut

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Data::Object::Scalar;

  my $scalar = Data::Object::Scalar->new(\*main);

=cut

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This package provides routines for operating on Perl 5 scalar objects.

=cut

=head1 INHERITANCE

This package inherits behaviors from:

L<Data::Object::Scalar::Base>

=cut

=head1 INTEGRATIONS

This package integrates behaviors from:

L<Data::Object::Role::Dumpable>

L<Data::Object::Role::Functable>

L<Data::Object::Role::Throwable>

=cut

=head1 LIBRARIES

This package uses type constraints defined by:

L<Data::Object::Library>

=cut

=head1 METHODS

This package implements the following methods.

=cut

=head2 defined

  defined() : NumObject

The defined method returns true if the object represents a value that meets the
criteria for being defined, otherwise it returns false. This method returns a
L<Data::Object::Number> object.

=over 4

=item defined example

  # given $scalar

  $scalar->defined; # 1

=back

=cut

=head2 eq

  eq(Any $arg1) : NumObject

This method is a consumer requirement but has no function and is not implemented.
This method will throw an exception if called.

=over 4

=item eq example

  # given $scalar

  $scalar->eq; # exception thrown

=back

=cut

=head2 ge

  ge(Any $arg1) : NumObject

This method is a consumer requirement but has no function and is not implemented.
This method will throw an exception if called.

=over 4

=item ge example

  # given $scalar

  $scalar->ge; # exception thrown

=back

=cut

=head2 gt

  gt(Any $arg1) : NumObject

This method is a consumer requirement but has no function and is not implemented.
This method will throw an exception if called.

=over 4

=item gt example

  # given $scalar

  $scalar->gt; # exception thrown

=back

=cut

=head2 le

  le(Any $arg1) : NumObject

This method is a consumer requirement but has no function and is not implemented.
This method will throw an exception if called.

=over 4

=item le example

  # given $scalar

  $scalar->le; # exception thrown

=back

=cut

=head2 lt

  lt(Any $arg1) : NumObject

This method is a consumer requirement but has no function and is not implemented.
This method will throw an exception if called.

=over 4

=item lt example

  # given $scalar

  $scalar->lt; # exception thrown

=cut

=head2 ne

  ne(Any $arg1) : NumObject

This method is a consumer requirement but has no function and is not implemented.
This method will throw an exception if called.
