XML-ApacheFOP version 0.03
==========================

XML::ApacheFOP allows you to use the Apache foundation's
FOP implementation with Perl.

Since FOP is written in Java, this module relies on Java.pm.
You will need to have FOP, Java2, and Java.pm
installed before installing this module. This README
provides some guidance for meeting each of those requirements.

This module has only been tested with Unix and its variants
(Linux, Solaris, etc.) If you get this module working with
Windows I would love to hear about it (along with how you did it.)


JAVA2 INSTALLATION

If you do not already have Java2 installed,
you can download it here:
http://java.sun.com/j2se/

See the Sun documentation for installation details.

This module has been tested with
Java2 (Standard Edition) version 1.4.x.


FOP INSTALLATION

You can download FOP at the following link:
http://xmlgraphics.apache.org/fop/

See the FOP documentation for installation details.


JAVA.PM INSTALLATION

You can download and/or read the docs for Java.pm at:
http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Java

In my experience, Java.pm must be installed manually
and not from CPAN. If you must install it via CPAN
you will need to enter "force install Java" in the
CPAN shell. This will install the module even if the
tests fail (which they usually do).

You may also have to do a force install of Java.pm
if you are installing the module remotely. The tests
try to popup GUI windows that will simply
not work when installing remotely.

If you want to get Java.pm to pass all of the
installation tests, you will need to install
the module manually.

After downloading the module, you will find a file
called JavaServer.jar. Note the location of the module,
then start the JavaServer with the following command:
/path/to/java -classpath /path/to/JavaServer.jar \
com.zzo.javaserver.JavaServer

Once the JavaServer is running you can proceed to
install Java.pm.

There is also a SourceForge page for JavaServer at:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/javaserver/


XML::ApacheFOP INSTALLATION

XML::ApacheFOP can be installed via CPAN or
by building it manually using the standard commands:

perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install


JavaServer SETUP

To use XML::ApacheFOP you will need to include the FOP jar
files in the classpath of the JavaServer startup command.

The -classpath will need to be tailored to suit your system.
Hopefully the following example will help you get it right though.

Here is the command I use:

/path/to/java -classpath \
/path/to/JavaServer.jar\
:/usr/local/xml-fop/build/fop.jar\
:/usr/local/xml-fop/lib/avalon-framework-cvs-20020806.jar\
:/usr/local/xml-fop/lib/batik.jar\
:/usr/local/xml-fop/lib/xalan-2.4.1.jar\
:/usr/local/xml-fop/lib/xercesImpl-2.2.1.jar \
com.zzo.javaserver.JavaServer

Once the JavaServer is running you will be ready to start using XML::ApacheFOP.
See the pod documentation for details on the interface usage.

DEBIAN INSTALLATION

Ken Neighbors has created Debian packages for Java.pm/JavaServer and XML::ApacheFOP.
This greatly eases the installation for the Debian platform.

You can get them at:
http://www.nsds.com/software/

SECURITY

JavaServer runs on port 2000 by default.
I highly recommend you firewall off this port from outside access.

It is also a good idea to use the authfile and allowed_paths options.
See the pod for details on how to do this.
