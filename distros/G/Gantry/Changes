This file documents the revision history for Perl extension Gantry

3.64 Wed Jan 13 09:30:55 PST 2010
    - fix session plugin test, reported by Andreas Koenig via RT
     
3.63 Wed Dec 05 12:46:00 CDT 2009
    - Fixed perl version in Build.PL to work with newer Module::Build.
      Thanks to Matt We...lol... sorry... almost made it through without
      laughing.

3.62 Wed Dec 02 10:36:00 CDT 2009
    - Added plugin to handle shibboleth authentication.

3.61 Thu Oct 15 14:13:00 CDT 2009
    - Added an Engine method that returns whether the current request is being
      served by an SSL-enabled host.

3.60 Wed Oct 14 17:03:00 CDT 2009
    - Added ability to test cache set methods. This is useful for cases where
      you need to ensure that cache sets/gets are working correctly. For
      example, Cache::Memcached does not return any errors if it cannot
      connect to the specified memcached server(s).
    - Added aditional parameter, expires, to the cache_set method in the
      Gantry::Plugins::Cache::Memcached module. Because the underlying
      memcached module supports setting individual expire times for items
      in the case, you can now specificy them. If a expire time is not set
      for the item, then the global cache_expires value is used (this
      maintains backwards-compatibility).

3.59 Fri July 10 17:45:00 CDT 2009
    - Added gantry_secret to serve as a default secret key so you don't have
      to specify different keys for the authcookie, session, cookie check etc.
    - Modify ap_req / apache_request so that it never recreates the
      Apache::Request object. libapreq2 does not like it when you do that
      and specify a max post size. It will throw a conflicting information
      error.
    - Removed code that was setting a test cookie. The code has been replaced
      by a cookie check plugin.
    - Preserve all parameters when redirecting during login so that the original
      request can be fulfilled after login. Also encrypt url during redirect
      to conceal any posted values you don't want appearing in the url.
    - Added methods to url encode / decode a specified value.
    - Modify plugin handling. Plugin method can now be imported into the symbol
      table of the application using the specified plugin namespace. This allows
      you to use otherwise incompatible plugins within the same server.
    - Allow import lists to be added to plugins so that the list of symbols
      imported can be controlled.
    - Removed sort of plugin callbacks. It was sorting sub references which basically
      equated to completely random ordering.
    - Added PRE_ACTION and POST_ACTION states where plugin callbacks can be
      registered.
    - Remove unneeded apreq parse call during file uploads.
    - Update form templates to decode unsafe html characters before sending them
      through HTML::SuperForm as it takes care of encoding the unsafe characters.

3.58 Thurs July 02 16:33:00 CDT 2009
    - Fix AuthCookie.pm so that if get_auth_schema hasn't been imported then
      it falls back to using get_schema.

3.57 Weds July 01 15:33:00 CDT 2009
    - Call find_redirect after calling form_add/form_edit. This allows the
      results of form methods to influence the final redirect location if
      needed.

3.56 Thurs June 25 16:09:00 CDT 2009
    - Removed Gantry::Plugins::Session since its being maintained
      externally now.
    - Also removed session.tt template.

3.55 Tues June 22 15:24:00 CDT 2009
    - Update AuthCookie to first check for matching user/pass then if
      that fails check for the user name by itself. This is needed
      so that encrypted passwords can be used.
    - Add reload_config option to Gantry::Conf to force config file to
      reload. Add reload_config option in 02flat.t test to fix test
      failures do to config file not reloading.
    - Modified Gantry::Conf to be able to parse its config file on import.
      Also modified MP20/MP13 db connection helpers to use cached Gantry::Conf.
      This fixes a performance issue where the entire gantry config could be
      reloaded up to 6 times per request.
    - Fixed get_auth_conn_info so that if gantry conf is being used
      but the auth db info is in the apache conf everything
      still works.
    - Fixed bug in Build.pm where files without an extension would not
      be installed and where directories containing a . would cause
      the build to die.
    - Trim leading / trailing whitespace from incoming parameters by default.
    - Added sfbb/form.tt template.
    - Modified CRUD.pm plugin to allow a default template to be specified in
      the config. The config option is default_form_template.
    - Fixed form.tt so that you can specify your own parameters
      in an onchange event.
    - Skip querying of foreign tables unless a foreign key is actually used on
      the form. This gives a huge speed increase when dealing with foreign
      tables with many rows.

3.54 Sun Mar 22 11:48:54 PDT 2009
    - build CPAN dist
    - All request parameter values will be filtered by default from now on.
      This is done to prevent XSS vulnerabilities.
      The filtering is pretty simple, as it is just translating angle brackets,
      < and >, and quotes, " and ', into their named-entity equivalents &lt;\
      and &gt;. If for some an application requires that all request parameter
      values be unfiltered (which is not safe, and opens the application up to
      XSS vulnerabilities), then they can specify a config option named
      'unfiltered_params'. This value can be set to either '1' or 'on'.  Also,
      if access to a request parameter is needed unfiltered, then the
      uf_params() method may be used.
    - Explicitly close auth database handle in Authorization and Authentication
      handlers on failure so that connections aren't left hanging around when
      Apache::DBI isn't being used.
    - Explicitly close database handles in Gantry cleanup() method so that
      connections aren't left hanging around when Apache::DBI isn't being used.
    - Change use of DBI->connect_cached() in Gantry::Utils::ModelHelper to
      DBI->connect() to prevent "idle in transaction" cases when Apache::DBI
      isn't being used and auto commit is turned off. What ends up happening is
      when a rollback or commit isn't explicitly issued, the transaction is
      left open on the database server in a "idle in transaction" state, even
      though the request has finished being processed.
    - Enhance results.tt
    - Add no_options configuration item to suppress header and row options.
    - Add options for adding a pre header row.
    - Allow more customizing via classes.
    - Add ability to specifiy a plugin directory.
    - Documentation cleanup.
    - Allow a custom template to be specified for CRUD delete action.
    - Allow foreign_display_rows to be constrained.
    - Don't read all rows into memory before processing.
    - Fix bug in is_date. check_date is not a class method.
    - Fix a bug with cgi engine. Post params were not being included as part of
      the cgi object because $self->get_post_body() gets the post body from the
      cgi object, which hadn't been created yet.
    - Fixed a bug with form.tt where input_value wasn't being reset.
    - Changed form.tt to not output a value attribute when the field has no value.
    - Changed FormMunger to throw an error when an invalid form field is
      specified. This prevents the form from getting corrupted.
    - Add option to allow form validation errors to be grouped together by the
      field. This allows for more versbose error reporting.
    - Skip form validation for non post requests. The results were being
      discarded anyways.
    - Add *.* to list of web_dirs so that files in the top level directory are
      also installed.
    - Fix bug in MP13.pm where adding headers would overwrite the previous header
      instead of appending.
    - update mod_perl2 test -- skip tests if Apache2::Request does not exist
    - Updated the documentation, add an external exception handler. Works
      correctly with the standalone server.
    - Added some experimental code to throw exceptions and catching them in
      a state machine. This would allow redirects and such to become exceptions,
      which could then be handled locally or within the handler.

3.53 Sun Jul  6 11:50:58 PDT 2008
    - modify Gantry::Server and Gantry::Engine::CGI to work with the
      new state machines.
    - add Gantry::State::Simple state machine 
    - replace unchecked evals around plugin callback execution (so that errors
      aren't thrown away) with a conditional to see if the arrayref is even
      defined.
    - moved engine_init() and post_engine_init plugin callback execution out
      of init() and into handler() above the init() call so that $r or CGI
      is available to any pre_init callback methods, and so that any errors
      that occur within those callbacks are caught correctly with
      cast_custom_error().

3.52
    - add relocate_permanently() to support 301 redirects (Stas Bekman)
    - patch Gantry.pm - add a simple sort to the plugin calls
    - add patches for Cache plugins
    - add Gantry::Utils::CRON
    - add setter/getter for Gantry::Utils::Crypt errors
    - explicitly call the MP20 engine import for the Auth modules
    - add handle_request_test_post for testing

3.51 Tue Aug 28 11:42:48 CDT 2007
    - fix bug in Gantry::Server::handle_request_test 
    - fix some warning bugs in form.tt
    - modify AuthCookie plugin to support testing with a logged in user
    - add test method to gantry
    - add multiselect option to Gantry::Utils::Threeway 
    - add serialize_params base method.
    
3.50 Tue Jun 19 14:04:10 CDT 2007
    - fixes to Gantry::Plugins::Session (Kevin Esteb)
    - add cache_purge option to Caching pluings (Kevin Esteb)
    - fix Gantry::Utils::DBIxClass util. Calling mk_classdata instead of 
      mk_classaccessor.
    - pass orm rom to AutoCRUD callbacks to text_descr.
      can used to produce a better description on the edit or delete page. 
    - add ability to override the file name when using the write_file method
      in Gantry::Utils::CRUDHelp
    - AuthCookie bug, fix root page login redirection
    - modify AuthCookie login failure error message
    - fix post_max in the CGI engine
    - add Gantry::Utils::Captcha
    - add Gantry::Utils::Crypt
    
3.49 Mon Apr 30 16:45:07 CDT 2007
    - add datetime_now db-agnostic wrapper to Gantry::Utils::DBIxClass
    - add post_body parsing to Plugins::SOAP::Doc
    - modify Gantry handler to work with the PageCache plugin
    - add Gantry::Plugins::PageCache
    - modify cache plugins
    - tie Gantry::Conf into Gantry cache. Specifying a cache plugin will
      enable caching for Gantry::Conf
    - add engine_cycle method to the Gantry object. 
    - add javascript helper for YUI popup calendaring
    - factor out login, logout routines in AuthCookie. AuthCookie now 
      provides login/logout methods that can be called at anytime from 
      anywhere in the app. (think registration form)
    - add add row level error messages to moxie form.tt
    - modify Gantry handler to store action
    - add js_root and js_rootp
	- add search cpan link to pod/doc viewing module
    - patch uninitialized warning in CGI engine 
    - replaced dojo with jquery javascript libraries for the Gantry samples. 
    - patch Gantry::Utils::DBConnHelper::MP20, the server starting test
      does not exist in mod_perl 2. Test was useless.
    - fixed file upload bug, the full extension for .tar.gz 
      was not being matched 
    - modified mod_perl2 test
    - fix link in doc
    - add patch from Stas for fix the permissions problem with Init.pm
    - fix gantry base_root bug -- base_root is now add just before template
      object creation.
    - add JSON to the requires list, JSON is not integrated into the
      CRUD do main method. 
    - added row level permissions by logged in user
    - added consume_post_body and get_post_body to engines, plugins can use
      this to preempt normal form parsing of the post body
    - changed soap plugins to use consume_post_body and get_post_body,
      making them engine agnostic

3.48 Wed Feb 21 13:52:00 CST 2007
    - add Gantry::Utils::Threeway
    - add save and add another to CRUD and AutoCRUD.  To get it from bigtop
      set 'save_and_add_another' to a true value in your form methods
      'extra_keys'.
    - fix crud so that if the form field is display then don't validate
    - add hints to form.tt
    - Revised tutorial to reflect current preferred practices.  This
      involved switching to DBIx::Class and discussing tentmaker.
    - Modify MP13 and MP20 engine to handle multiple entries for form
      parameters. Form parameters that contain multiple values will be 
      joined with nulls ( "\0" ). This is exactly how CGI.pm behaves.
    - changed sample_wrapper stylesheet example to use doc_rootp so it
      can work with stand alone server.
    - Added FormMunger util to massage form fields needed by form.tt.
    - Added no_cancel flag to form.tt, set it if you don't want the
      Cancel button.  In bigtop, set this as one of your form methods
      'extra_keys'.
    - Added onchange to form.tt.  Give it the name of a javascript function
      to trigger when a select list changes (type must be select).  You
      can set this in bigtop with the new html_form_onchange statement.

3.47 Mon Jan 22 09:11:06 CST 2007
    - Added Gantry::Plugins::Session
    - Added Ganty SOAP Support
    - AuthCookie will not redirect to a full url if the 'url' param is passed.
      i.e. <input type="hidden" name="url" value="http://www.here.com/" />
    - added test for AjaxFORM
    - Added auth_cookie_name and auth_cookie_domain as optional conf based
      accessors for AuthCookie plugin.
    - Added log_error method to CGI engine, so all engines have it.
    - Added AJAX form plugin.
    - Added Session plugin with pluggable caching storage mechanism.
      (thanks to Kevin Esteb for all the plugins in this release except SOAP)
    - Added SOAP plugin (mod_perl 2 only).
    - Changed how plugin namespaces work.  Use the new -PluginNamespace
      wherever you use -Engine, follow that with the plugins you want.

3.46 Wed Dec 20 12:18:43 CST 2006
    - Fixed uninitialized warnings in the TT template engine.
    - Fixed CRUD plugin's validator callback use in edit.
    - Added Gantry::Build to simplify Build.PLs that need to install
      web content.
    - Added Gantry::Plugins::AjaxCRUD, thanks to Kevin Esteb for
      submitting it.
    
3.45 Mon Dec 11 10:10:13 CST 2006
    - Arranged documenation
    - Fixed namespace issue with Gantry::Plugins::AuthCookie
   
3.44 Tue Dec  5 09:42:01 CST 2006
    - Added Gantry::Utils::FormErrors to manifest.
   
3.43 Tue Dec  5 09:09:00 CST 2006
    - moved uri, location, path_info, method above the init callback
    - Param cleaning for CRUD and AutoCRUD no longer makes 0 ints null.
      But it does make blank ints null.
    - DBIx::Class autocrud helper now uses transactions so you don't need
      to set AutoCommit => 1 to use it.
    - added Gantry::Plugins::AuthCookie ( cookie based auth ). Supports
      DBIx::Class user models and Apache htpasswd files.
    - added Template::Plugin::GantryAuthCookie for decrypting auth cookies
      from Apache::Templates.
    - added plugin functionality to various phases of the request. Currently
      you can register the plugin and its callback at the init, pre_init, 
      post_init, pre_process and post_process phase. 
      See Gantry::Plugins::AuthCookie for an example.
    - Gantry::Plugins::CRUD has a new callback: validator in case you
      don't want or can't use Data::FormValidator.

3.42 Thu Oct 19 10:05:57 CDT 2006
    - Added Samples.
    - Missing and Invalid fields on form.tt now have their labels in the
      error message instead of their names.
    - Gantry.pm's set_auth_model now requires the model for you.
    - CRUD add, edit, and delete methods now allow their invokers to set
      $self->stash->view->title to override default window and table titles.
    - Added support for generic errors on form.tt (not just missing or
      invalid).
    - Added field type 'display' to form.tt for fields which should be
      displayed, but not in an input element.
    - Added content key to form.tt's fields hashes.  This helps when you have
      a Question #. Text label for input elements, but don't want all that
      text reported in errors.
    - Added file upload.

3.41 Wed Oct  4 14:58:22 CDT 2006
    - Corrected response header handling in CGI engine.
    - Corrected Gantry::Conf so it won't be tested if it can't be used.
    - Added main.tt to the MANIFEST.  Bigtop uses it for defaul pages.
    - Tried again to make prompts visible during CPAN shell install.

3.40 Fri Sep 22 08:14:15 CDT 2006
    - Restored and expanded warning avoidance from Gantry.pm accessors.
      If you ask for a path, you no longer get undef.  At least you get ''.

3.39 Thu Sep 21 14:20:17 CDT 2006
    - switched plugin, engine loading from string eval to require
    - added cookie support to the cgi engine.
    - bug fix to default form.tt - form didn't always select the correct
      default/previous value in the select lists.
    - improved Gantry::Conf so gantry.d includes work and instances
      can conf directly in the gantry.conf or gantry.d instance block.
    - added Net::Server support to stand alone server (it's slow)
    - suppressed some annoying undefined value warnings.

3.38 Wed Aug 16 16:26:03 CDT 2006
    - Gantry supports DBIx::Class
    - added tests for auth handlers and models using SQLite
    - added style to auth pages
    - add extra testing features to the standalone server.

3.36 Thu Aug 10 09:25:12 CDT 2006
    - Took another crack at DBIx::Class

3.35 Never installed
    - Corrected DBIx::Class interactions

3.34 Tue Aug  8 13:27:57 CDT 2006
    - Added a default Gantry::Init for use during testing.

3.33 Tue Aug  8 10:39:14 CDT 2006
    - Modify Build.PL to write the Gantry::Init file during the install.
      This module contains the install options that can be referenced later.
    - Added action (cancel or submit) and user action (add, edit, or delete)
      to the end of the parameter list for the redirect callback in CRUD.
    - Added create method to Gantry::Utils::DBIxClass, calling it (instead
      of the one provided by DBIx::Class::ResultSet) returns a row with a
      valid id, even when the id is generated by a sequence within postgres.

3.32 Mon Jul 17 13:49:33 CDT 2006
	- added Perlbal client ip fix
    - Removed ident from essential column list for auth_users table.
      This makes the model classes compatible with prior auth schemes which
      did not have that column.
    - Changed the Apache basic auth scheme slightly to accomodate apps which
      rely on the Class::DBI.  Users now append either Regular or CDBI
      to all module names used for auth (except Access which never
      used auth databases).
    - Added stringify, and an overload to call it, for the DBIxClass Util
      module.  Without it, form.tt can't show selected items foreign keys
      point to.

3.31 Jun  2 14:46:36 CDT 2006 
	- Doc updates to Gantry.pm, Tutorial and FAQ
    - Added support for DBIx::Class.  (AutoCRUD still only works for ORMs
      with Class::DBI's API.)
    - Converted Gantry::Control::C::* auth modules to use Gantry native models.
    - Cleaned up (that is reduced) the prerequist list in Build.PL.
    - Cleaned up Web Directory questions during ./Build install.
    - Corrected problem with Gantry::Conf parameter fishing in the CGI engine.

3.30 Wed May 10 13:01:44 CDT 2006
    - Corrected bug in CGI engine which made the constructor demand a valid
      hash as an argment.  Now an empty one is supplied by default, making
      it work as the QuickStart doc says it should.  Thanks to Краси Беров
      for pointing this out.

3.29
    - Restored access to dircopy from File::Copy::Recursive to
      custom install code.

3.27-8 Tue Apr 18 15:29:15 CDT 2006 - Tue Apr 18 15:45:32 CDT 2006
    - Made failure due to absence of File::Copy::Recursive gentler.

3.26 Mon Apr 17 14:25:48 CDT 2006
	- Updates to custom error page

3.25 Fri Apr  7 12:53:20 CDT 2006
	- Added Test

3.24 Thu Apr  6 15:12:12 CDT 2006
	- Rearranged/Added more tests
	
3.23 Thu Apr  6 08:44:44 CDT 2006
	- Fixes to the db connection methods
	
3.22 Thu Mar 30 12:41:36 CST 200
	- Added test method to the Gantry server to be used for
	  to run a test on a Gantry application
	
3.21 Wed Mar 29 12:41:36 CST 200
	- Updates to documentation
3.20
	- Added a stand alone web server, Gantry::Server
	- Updates to documentation.
3.19
	- Modified Build.PL. Now copies all files in the root folder.
    - Updated the Gantry::Conf api so you can get location level
      config.
    - Corrected the mechanism for using Gantry::Conf so mulitple
      instances in the same server can really have different conf.

3.18
 	- Documentation updates
3.17
	- tied Gantry::Conf to the framework
    - added initial Gantry::Conf code and stubs for the future 
    - Updated constraint handling in AutoCRUD and CRUD to use the
      current Data::FormValidator constraint_methods key.
    - Updated Gantry::Conf to use ConfigureVia Method insteadn of
      ConfigureViaMethod which allows for multiple ConfigureVia statements
      in the same instance block and easier dispatching.

3.16
	- added PODViewer 
    - CGI Engine fix, casting error to wrong method
	- fixed prompt problem when installing within CPAN shell

3.15 Thu Feb 16 09:22:03 CST 2006
	- add paging.ttc ( paging for the results.tt )
    - added cgi parameter parsing code
	- Added lots of Docs modules
    - Refactored handler and init so that all conf fishing and other
      engine specific code is actually in the engines not Gantry.pm

3.14 Wed Feb  1 08:09:54 CST 2006
	- modified engines
	- added CGI::Simple object to all
	- improved cgi error messages
    - restored connection info scheme having found the bug (mod_perl
      helpers were still caching the conn_info data, so everyone was
      going to the first database hit)
    - renamed Gantry::Utils::ModelHelper to Gantry::Utils::DBConnHelper
      to better reflect what it helps with (renamed all it subclasses too)
    - added Gantry::Utils::Model as a Class::DBI replacement
    - added Gantry::Utils::ModelHelper to provide db_Main and other
      useful methods as mixins to Gantry::Utils::Model::* modules.
    Note that no production app uses Gantry::Utils::Model yet.
    - removed accessors in Gantry.pm for dbconn, dbuser, and dbpass

3.13 Fri Jan 20 13:27:21 CST 2006
    - Added script auth connection handling to db_Main in AuthCDBI util.
    - Added doc stubs in modules.

3.12 Thu Jan 19 10:44:31 CST 2006
    - Added retreive_all_for_main_listing to Gantry::Utils::AuthCDBI
      which we needed to do since we separated Malcolm's auth models
      from the regular ones.

3.09 - 3.11
	- AuthCDBI, CBDI testing

3.08
  	- Add Access auth module ( Gantry::Control::C::Access )
      provides IP authentication for mod_perl.
	- updates to pod
	- updates to Template Default
    - Changed connection info scheme for regular and cgi scripts
      in Gantry::Utils::CDBI.  This required moving connection info
      fishing from init_cgi in Gantry.pm to Gantry::Engine::CGI->new
    - Expanded the connection info scheme change to all engine types
      by introducting Gantry::Utils::ModelHelper as a (mostly) abstract
      base class from which a new module for each engine inherits
    - Expanded connection info scheme to the auth db connecitons.
      CGI may not be working correctly under the new scheme.
