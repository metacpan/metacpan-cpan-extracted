    - Specified min version of perl 5.6.0
    - Now "use warnings"

0.15 2013-09-28
    - Hadn't specified meta-spec version 2, so github repo wasn't turning
      up in the metadata.

    - Changed the repository meta_merge to the new format
    - Tweaked format (mainly release dates) to conform to CPAN::Changes::Spec

    - first test release by NEILB after getting comaint
    - no changes other than specifying github repository

0.13 2009-03-30
    - $module->require now always resets $@ which removes a trap of using $@
      to indicate an error, rather than checking $module->require directly.
      [rt.cpan.org 44444]

0.12 2009-03-30
    - bleadperl introduced a new warning deprecating "use UNIVERSAL"
      (thank goodness) which interfered with t/require.t

    - Sped up require() by about 400% for already loaded modules.
