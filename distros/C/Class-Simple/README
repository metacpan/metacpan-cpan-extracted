Class-Simple
=========================

This is a simple object-oriented base class.  There are plenty of oth-
ers that are much more thorough and whatnot but sometimes I want some-
thing simple so I can get just going (no doubt because I am a simple
guy) so I use this.

What do I mean by simple?  First off, I don't want to have to list out
all my methods beforehand.  I just want to use them (Yeah, yeah, it
doesn't catch typos--that's what testing and Class::Std are for :-).
Next, I want to be able to call my methods by $obj->foo(1) or
$obj->set_foo(1), by $obj->foo() or $obj->get_foo().  Don't tell ME I
have to use get_ and set_ (I would just override that restriction in
Class::Std anyway).  Simple!

I did want some neat features, though, so these are inside-out objects
(meaning the object isn't simply a hash so you can't just go in and
muck with attributtes outside of methods), privatization of methods is
supported, as is serialization out and back in again.

Note that this is my first module for CPAN so please be gentle
with the noob.
