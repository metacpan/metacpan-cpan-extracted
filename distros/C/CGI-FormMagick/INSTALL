Installation instructions for FormMagick 0.3.1

PRE-REQUISITES

You need a metric buttload of modules for this to work.  Here's the
basic list:

	CGI::Persistent
	Persistence::Object::Simple
	XML::Parser
	Text::Template
	Locale::Maketext

The following are required by certain validation routines.  If you don't
use the validation routine (given in parentheses) you won't need the
module.

	Time::ParseDate			(date)
	Geography::States		(US_state)
	Net::IPv4ADDR			(ip_address)
	Locale::Country			(iso_country_code)

You'll also need a web server configured to run CGIs.

INSTALLATION

Install as for any CPAN module (hopefully).  Let me know if this doesn't
work or you have any trouble... this is the first theoretically
CPAN-ready version of this module, and we're not sure if it's quite
right.

COMMON PROBLEMS

Q. My perl modules are installed in /usr/local, and testfm.pl isn't seeing them. 

A. Look in /etc/rc.d/init.d (on Redhat machines) or /etc/init.d (on Debian machines)
for the script that starts apache. Make sure that the PATH is set there
so that it looks for perl in /usr/local/bin before it looks in /usr/bin.
