     __________________________________________________________________

   This chapter describes how you can get and install dvd::rip. You can
   try one of the several binary distributions or install it from the
   source.

   1.1 Binary distributions

   Installation of dvd::rip isn't that hard, but fulfilling the
   requirements actually is (simply because there are a lot ;). So you
   should first try a binary installation using the package manager of
   your Linux distribution. This should track all dependencies
   automatically and speed up things significantly.

   1.1.1 Debian packages

   Christian Marillat builds video related Debian packages and publishes
   them on his website http://www.debian-multimedia.org. You can use
   apt-get to install the packages if you add one of the following entries
   (depending on your distribution) to your /etc/apt/sources.list file:

deb http://www.debian-multimedia.org sarge main
deb http://www.debian-multimedia.org etch main
deb http://www.debian-multimedia.org sid main
deb http://www.debian-multimedia.org experimental main

   You will find all packages to compile transcode on your own (if you
   need always the very latest versions), or can get binaries of
   reasonably recent transcode versions directly. The same applies to
   dvd::rip.

   The dvd::rip package is called dvdrip.

   1.1.2 SuSE packages

   On packman.links2linux.org you find several video related RPM's,
   including dvd::rip and transcode:

     dvd::rip at packman.links2linux.org
     http://packman.links2linux.org/ homepage

   1.1.3 Mandrake packages

   Mandrake users can get actual dvd::rip and transcode RPM's from the
   Penguin Liberation Front lair.

     http://plf.zarb.org/

   1.1.4 RedHat packages

   Matthias Saou does a great job in building dvd::rip and other
   multimedia related packages. You can find them at freshrpms.net. This
   is a direct link the dvd::rip package:

     http://freshrpms.net/rpm/perl-Video-DVDRip

   1.1.5 gentoo packages

   You can get dvd::rip and transcode from the official gentoo package
   repository:

     http://packages.gentoo.org/search/?sstring=dvdrip

   1.1.6 FreeBSD port

   dvd::rip is available in the FreeBSD ports collection. To install from
   source, cd to ${PORTSDIR}/multimedia/dvdrip and type 'make install
   clean'. To install a binary package of the port, type 'pkg_add -r
   dvdrip'. Note however that the default installation of the transcode
   port which dvd::rip depends on is very minimalistic, it is recommended
   to look at the Makefile of the transcode port, enable all the options
   you need for dvd::rip and install the transcode port from source.
   Thanks to Michael Nottebrock, who maintains the FreeBSD port.

   1.1.7 OpenBSD port

   Since June 2004 we have also an official OpenBSD port of dvd::rip. You
   find it under graphics/dvdrip. Thanks to the maintainer Waldemar
   Brodkorb.

   1.2 Source download

   1.2.1 dvd::rip tarball download

   You can download dvd::rip sources from this server or all stable
   releases from any CPAN mirror.

   Local download of the latest stable release: (currently no unstable
   release available)

     dvdrip-0.98.10.tar.gz
     dvdrip-0.98.10.tar.gz.asc (GnuPG signature, get key)

   CPAN download directory: (list of mirrors)

     http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-authors/id/J/JR/JRED/

   You can download older versions from here:

     http://www.exit1.org/dvdrip/dist/
     http://www.exit1.org/dvdrip/dist/pre/

   This is a directory, which contains several user contributed files, you
   probably find useful:

     http://www.exit1.org/dvdrip/contrib/

   1.2.2 CVS access

   This is mainly intended for developers and CVS experienced users. This
   CVS repository is only a read only mirror of my main repository. It's
   updated manually when I publish releases or pre-releases, so there is
   no advantage for normal users compared to downloading the tar balls
   (besides making it easier using "cvs update" ;)

   Since development of dvd::rip is divided into two branches, you get the
   current (unstable) version, if you don't specifiy a release tag. If you
   want to access a stable version, add -r rel-MAJOR-MINOR-PATCH to your
   cvs checkout command (example: for 0.48.5 this is -r rel-0-48-5). If
   you always want to have the latest stable patch release, use -r
   rel-MAJOR-MINOR-patches (e.g. -r rel-0-50-patches). All subsequent
   updates will stay on this branch (here: 0.50). The easiest way of
   switching to another branch is creating a new checkout using the
   corresponding release tag.

   Root                            Module Unstable tag Stable tag
   :pserver:cvs@cvs.exit1.org:/cvs dvdrip none         rel-MAJOR-MINOR-PATCH

   1.2.2.1 CVS examples

   Log into CVS server with:

cvs -z3 -d :pserver:cvs@cvs.exit1.org:/cvs login

          (Press ENTER for password)

   Checkout latest version of the actual stable branch (here 0.50.x):

cvs -z3 -d :pserver:cvs@cvs.exit1.org:/cvs checkout -r rel-0-50-patches dvdrip

   Checkout a specific stable/bugfix version (here 0.50.13) with:

cvs -z3 -d :pserver:cvs@cvs.exit1.org:/cvs checkout -r rel-0-50-13 dvdrip

   Checkout the current development version with:

cvs -z3 -d :pserver:cvs@cvs.exit1.org:/cvs checkout dvdrip

   Update a checkout - created using one of the commands above - with:

cd dvdrip; cvs -z3 update

   1.3 Requirements

   dvd::rip is a Gtk+ based program written in Perl, using the video
   processing tool transcode and many other tools for the internals. So
   you first have to get some prerequisites before installing dvd::rip.

   dvd::rip expects all command line tools mentioned here to be found in
   the standard search PATH.

   1.3.1 External command line tools

   This table gives a brief overview of the tools used by dvd::rip
   (everything but the Perl modules - see the chapters below for more
   information about them). Most tools are optional - the corresponding
   dvd::rip modules are just switched off, if you don't have them.

   But you need at least the tools marked mandatory, otherwise dvd::rip
   will complain with an error message on startup. You can get also a
   dvd::rip window listing this information, refer to the corresponding
   chapter in the documentation for details.

   Tool Comment Mandatory Suggested Minimum Maximum
   transcode dvd::rip is nothing without transcode Yes 1.0.2 0.6.14 -
   ImageMagick Needed for preview image processing Yes 6.2.3 4.0.0 -
   ffmpeg FFmpeg video converter command line program No 0.4.10 -
   xvid4conf xvid4 configuration tool No 1.12 1.6 -
   subtitle2pgm Needed for subtitles No 0.3 0.3 -
   lsdvd Needed for faster DVD TOC reading No 0.15 0.15 -
   rar Needed for compressed vobsub subtitles No 2.71 2.71 2.99
   mplayer Needed for subtitle vobsub viewing No 1.00 0.90 -
   ogmtools Needed for OGG/Vorbis No 1.5 1.0.0 -
   dvdxchap For chapter progress bar (ogmtools) No 1.5 1.0.0 -
   mjpegtools Needed for (S)VCD encoding No 1.6.2 1.6.0 -
   xine Can be used to view DVD's/files No 0.9.15 0.9.13 -
   fping Only for cluster mode master No 2.4 2.2 -
   hal Used for DVD device scanning No 0.5.7 0.5 -

   1.3.2 Perl 5.6.0 or better

   You need a recent Perl version on your system. Perl 5.8.x is
   recommended, 5.6.0 and 5.6.1 should work also. dvd::rip won't start
   with Perl versions prior to 5.6.0. Actual distributions ship minimum
   5.6.1, so this shouldn't be a real problem, anyway.

   1.3.3 Perl modules

   Since dvd::rip is mostly written in Perl it requires a bunch of Perl
   modules. Check if your distribution has installation packages for them,
   otherwise download them from CPAN and install from source.

   Some required Perl modules are shipped with dvd::rip for your
   convenience. These are pure Perl modules which need no C-Compiler or
   something like that for installation. dvd::rip detects if these modules
   are missing on your system and installs them together with its own
   program files. Refer to the Install from source chapter for details
   about this mechanism.

   This table lists all Perl modules, usual names for installation
   packages and CPAN URL's for download:

   Perl Module Package name CPAN URL Shipped with dvd::rip
   Gtk2 libgtk2-perl search.cpan.org No
   Event libevent-perl search.cpan.org No
   Locale::TextDomain libintl-perl-xs search.cpan.org No
   Gtk2::Ex::FormFactory libgtk2-ex-formfactory-perl search.cpan.org Yes
   AnyEvent libanyevent-perl search.cpan.org Yes
   Event::ExecFlow libevent-execflow-perl search.cpan.org Yes
   Event::RPC libevent-rpc-perl search.cpan.org Yes

   To install a Perl module from source, execute these commands:

tar xfz Some-Perl-Module-x.xx.tar.gz
cd Some-Perl-Module-x.xx
perl Makefile.PL
make test
sudo make install

   1.3.4 rar (for vobsub compression)

   Some special notes about the rar program. MPlayer supports vobsub files
   compressed with rar, but you need a 2.x version, 3.x and higher doesn't
   work. You can get a 2.x version locally from here:

     http://www.exit1.org/dvdrip/contrib/rarlnx271.sfx.bin

   I suggest to install the binary to e.g. /usr/local/bin. Then configure
   this path using the Preferences dialog.

   1.4 Install from source

   1.4.1 Install dvd::rip

   This is quite easy, if you have managed to install the packages
   mentioned above... ;)

   Download the .tar.gz archive of the dvd::rip version you want to
   install. Then extract the file, change into the created directory, and
   execute the Makefile.PL script:

# as a normal user
tar xfz dvdrip-x.xx.tar.gz
cd dvdrip-x.xx
perl Makefile.PL

   As mentioned in the Required Perl modules chapter above dvd::rip can
   install some of the required Perl modules for you automatically. If
   dvd::rip detects such missing modules on your system, you get an output
   like this from perl Makefile.PL:

Note:
-----
The following modules are required for dvd::rip but not found on your
system. They're shipped with dvd::rip for your convenience and will be
installed automatically when you run 'make install':

  AnyEvent Event::ExecFlow Event::RPC

You can ignore the 'prerequisite not found' warnings beyond for them.

If you don't like this and want to install these modules manually
just set SKIP_UNPACK_REQUIRED_MODULES before executing Makefile.PL,
e.g. this way:

  SKIP_UNPACK_REQUIRED_MODULES=1 perl Makefile.PL

Checking if your kit is complete...
Looks good
Warning: prerequisite AnyEvent 1.02 not found.
Warning: prerequisite Event::ExecFlow 0.62 not found.
Warning: prerequisite Event::RPC 0.89 not found.
Writing Makefile for Video::DVDRip

   If your distribution has installation packages for these modules, it's
   recommended to use these. Install them and run 'perl Makefile.PL'
   again.

   Now run 'make test' and if no errors were reported 'make install' (as
   root):

make test
sudo make install

   You can ommit the "make install" step. But then you can execute the
   'dvdrip' binary only from the build directory and you must put
   "$PWD/bin" into your PATH (export PATH=$PWD:$PATH), otherwise dvd::rip
   can't find its files.

   1.4.2 Update dvd::rip

   Updating is just like installing. The only thing you should be aware of
   is switching the underlying Perl version. This way you easily can get
   two versions of dvd::rip installed in your system, because dvd::rip
   installs its libraries in your Perl library directory. Such a
   installation mixing isn't recommended unless you know exactly what
   you're doing. So it's better to remove the old version from the old
   Perl directory if you change the Perl version (refer to the uninstall
   chapter for details).
   Read the Changes file!

   I strongly suggest you should read at least the latest change log entry
   of the Changes file, resp. all entries of the versions you probably
   skipped in case of an update. It contains important release notes, e.g.
   about compatibility issues, and all relevant changes from release to
   release.

   Note:
   Changes on the unstable branch are logged in the file Changes.unstable.

   1.4.3 Multiple dvd::rip versions in parallel

   It's possible to use several dvd::rip versions in parallel on your
   system, but you can install only one version using make install into
   your system directories.

   Just extract another dvd::rip version you want to use somewhere, enter
   the created directory (dvdrip-x.xx) and execute perl Makefile.PL &&
   make here (no make install). Add the actual directory to your PATH
   (export PATH=$PWD:$PATH) and you can start this version with bin/dvdrip
   from this directory. All files and libraries located in the actual
   distribution directory will be used. The . in PATH is neccessary,
   otherwise some dvd::rip helper binaries may be taken from another
   place.

tar xvfz dvdrip-x.xx.tar.gz
cd dvdrip-x.xx
perl Makefile.PL && make
export PATH=$PWD:$PATH
bin/dvdrip

   1.5 Uninstall dvd::rip

   If you didn't use a package manager to install dvd::rip and you want to
   uninstall it, follow these instructions. This is necessary, if you
   accidentally mixed several versions on your system, which may result in
   a broken dvd::rip at all. In this case best thing is to remove all
   instances and to do a clean installation afterwards.

   dvd::rip mainly consists of a bunch of Perl modules which reside in the
   Perl library directory of your Perl interpreter. Easiest way to find
   this directory is to use the locate program. Then a few executables
   belong to dvd::rip, which also can be found using locate. This is an
   example session of how this works:

% locate DVDRip.pm
/usr/local/share/perl/5.8.0/Video/DVDRip.pm
% rm -r /usr/local/share/perl/5.8.0/Video/DVDRip*
% locate dvdrip
/usr/bin/dvdrip
/usr/bin/dvdrip-exec
/usr/bin/dvdrip-master
...
% rm /usr/bin/dvdrip*

   In words: find a Perl library directory called Video with DVDRip.pm in
   it. Remove the DVDRip.pm file and the subdirectory called DVDRip. Then
   find the location of the binaries and remove them - see the list above.
   If you find multiple instances this way, remove them all.

   [3]documentation, in particular the [4]FAQ, subscribe to the
   [5]dvdrip-users mailing list and ask your question there (but not
   before you read all information on this page!).

   Eric S. Raymond wrote an excellent article about [6]"How To Ask
   Questions The Smart Way ". You probably want to take a look at it
   before posting ;)

Reporting bugs and suggestions (*please* read this!)

   If you want to send a bug report, patch or feature request, please make
   sure, that you're using the most recent version of dvd::rip (at least
   the latest stable release). Also first check the [7]documentation, in
   particular the [8]FAQ, the [9]ChangeLog and the [10]mailing list
   archive to see, if the bug is reported and probably fixed already in
   the development release. For feature requests, please check if it's not
   already noted on the [11]TODO list. We all know, reading documentation
   is boring, but it saves time ;) Thanks.

   It's really important that you add the following information to your
   bug reports, otherwise you'll likely don't get any helpful answers
   (probably no answer at all, because for most people it's boring to ask
   for this again and again...):
     * a description of how the bug can be reproduced.
     * information about your Linux installation, in particular which
       distribution/version you are using
     * exact versions of all affected packages. That's always dvd::rip and
       transcode, but often a bunch of other packages are important, e.g.
       ogmtools (if it's about ogg/vorbis) or mjpegtools (if it's about
       (S)VCD processing) and so on. You can get a list of most of these
       version numbers by pressing Ctrl+D in the dvd::rip main window.
     * information about usage of binary packages or self compiled
       packages. In case of binary packages: from where did you get them.
     * if dvd::rip crashes or it looks like an internal dvd::rip bug and
       not like a bug of external command execution, add the output of
       "perl -V".
     * if a specific command executed by dvd::rip fails, grab the
       corresponding command line from the log and execute it by hand. It
       is important that you add the complete command line and the
       complete command output to your report.

transcode related issues

   If dvd::rip mainly works for you but you encounter problems ripping
   specific DVDs, this is probably a transcode problem. Maybe you want to
   report this directly to the transcode developers resp. to the
   [12]transcode-users list. If you're not sure about this, report the
   problem to the dvdrip-users list, and we'll see, what we can do for
   you. But aware, that you may be pointed to the transcode-users list...
   ;)

Encrypted DVD's

   Please note: copying encrypted DVD's is illegal in many countries. Also
   it's illegal to provide information about how this could be
   accomplished. So don't send any questions regarding encrypted DVD's or
   DVD cracking to the author of dvd::rip or to the dvd::rip mailing list.
   Corresponding mails will be silently ignored, correspondent posts will
   be removed from the mailing list archive without notification.

Contribute with patches

   Patches are welcome, preferably unified context diffs created this way
   (if you're familiar with CVS, you should use the [13]CVS repository and
   create patches with CVS):
  cd Video-DVDRip-0.48.2.patched
  make realclean
  cd ..
  diff -urN Video-DVDRip-0.48.2 Video-DVDRip-0.48.2.patched > patchfile.txt

   where Video-DVDRip-0.48.2 is the root directory of the original
   distribution and Video-DVDRip-0.48.2.patched your modified version.
   Without the make realclean all files created during make are added to
   the patch, what's not what we want.

If it simply works

   If dvd::rip works for you without any problems and you like it, don't
   hesitate to drop a mail. Next to all those problem and bug reports some
   positive postings delight every coders heart ;)

   Revision history and release notes for dvd::rip.

   0.98.11 [stable branch] Sat Mar 6 2010, joern
    Notes:
    - Event::ExecFlow version 0.64 is required for this version.
      This fixes a bug where no error messages were shown after
      ripping short. It was reported via Ubunutu Launchpad:
      https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/dvdrip/+bug/478710
      (You find it in the perl-modules/ directory, which was updated
       to the most recent versions btw)
      
    Features:
    - Updated Danish and Catalan translation. Thanks to Ysangkok,
      Kenneth Nielson and Joan Farrerons.
    - Turn "ripping short" error message into a warning, so the
      ripping process continues and it's up to the user to decide
      whether this is critical or not.

    Bugfixes:
    - Fixed h264 2pass cluster mode bug, generating a malformed
      transcode command. Reported by semkath <semkath AT arcor.de>
      and Christiaan Putter <ceputter AT googlemail.com>.
