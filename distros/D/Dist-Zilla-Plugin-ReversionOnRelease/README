NAME

    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::ReversionOnRelease - Bump and reversion $VERSION
    on release

SYNOPSIS

      [VersionFromModule]
      [ReversionOnRelease]
      prompt = 1
      [CopyFilesFromRelease]
      match = \.pm$

DESCRIPTION

    This is a Dist::Zilla plugin that bumps version (a la perl-reversion
    -bump) in-place with the .pm files inside lib. You should most likely
    use this plugin in combination with
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::VersionFromModule so that current VERSION is taken
    out of your main module, and then the released file is written back
    after the release with Dist::Zilla::Plugin::CopyFilesFromRelease.

    Unlike perl-reversion, this module uses Version::Next to get more
    naturally incremented version, instead of a little strict 3-digit rules
    in Perl::Version.

    You should not use this plugin with any code munging or Pod::Weaver
    plugins.

    By default, this plugin bumps version by the smallest possible increase
    - if you have 0.001, the next version is 0.002. You can override that
    by either running the plugin with prompt option to give the desired
    value from the prompt, or by setting the environment variable V:

      > V=1.001000 dzil release

      was not already present

      * Dist::Zilla::Plugin::BumpVersionAfterRelease::Transitional - like
      Dist::Zilla::Plugin::BumpVersionAfterRelease, but also adds the
      $VERSION into the repository code if it was not already present
