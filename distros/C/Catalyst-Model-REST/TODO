	Api and internals may still change, but changes are smaller now.

Misc
- Error handling
  Handle situation when getting non-decoded content back
- Serializers
  Is it possible to send json and receive yaml? Should I handle it?
- Find a way to overwrite request object so it will be possible to use in 
  controller tests (?)
