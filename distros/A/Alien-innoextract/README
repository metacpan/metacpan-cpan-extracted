SYNOPSIS
    Command line tool:

DESCRIPTION
    This distribution provides innoextract so that it can be used by other
    Perl distributions that are on CPAN. It does this by first trying to
    detect an existing install of innoextract on your system. If found it
    will use that. If it cannot be found, the source code will be downloaded
    from the internet and it will be installed in a private share location
    for the use of other modules.
