                             version 0.03

To install, type

  # perl Makefile.PL
  # make
  # make test
  # make install

The test of course is optional, but if it doesn't work the
installation probably won't.

man Ao(3pm) for information on using the library, and pcmplay(1p) for
information on the pcmplay script.  Also see the general Ogg Vorbis
documentation available at http://www.xiph.org/ogg/vorbis/.
