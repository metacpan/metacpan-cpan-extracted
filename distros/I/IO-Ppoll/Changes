0.08    BUGFIXES:
         * Fix off-by-one error when removing an fd which causes an
           uninitialised pollfd element to enter the set instead
         * Use dedicated pipe in test script rather than STDIN/STDOUT, which
           the containing test system may have altered in ways that make our
           test fail
