    -i, --ignore-errors              Continue on download errors, for example to
                                     skip unavailable videos in a playlist
                                     (default) (Alias: --no-abort-on-error)
    --abort-on-error                 Abort downloading of further videos if an

                                     extractors and exit
    --force-generic-extractor        Force extraction to use the generic
                                     extractor
    --default-search PREFIX          Use this prefix for unqualified URLs. For
                                     example "gvsearch2:" downloads two videos
                                     from google videos for the search term
                                     "large apple". Use the value "auto" to let
                                     yt-dlp guess ("auto_warning" to emit a
                                     warning when guessing). "error" just throws
                                     an error. The default value "fixup_error"
                                     repairs broken URLs, but emits an error if
                                     this is not possible instead of searching

                                     specify range: "--playlist-items

                                     at index 1, 2, 3, 7, 10, 11, 12 and 13

                                     The date can be "YYYYMMDD" or in the format
                                     "(now|today)[+-][0-9](day|week|month|year)(
                                     s)?"

    --dateafter DATE                 Download only videos uploaded on or after

    --match-filter FILTER            Generic video filter. Any field (see
                                     "OUTPUT TEMPLATE") can be compared with a
                                     number or a string using the operators
                                     defined in "Filtering formats". You can
                                     also simply specify a field to match if the
                                     field is present and "!field" to check if
                                     the field is not present. In addition,
                                     Python style regular expression matching
                                     can be done using "~=", and multiple
                                     filters can be checked with "&". Use a "\"
                                     to escape "&" or quotes if needed. Eg:
                                     --match-filter "!is_live & like_count>?100
                                     & description~='(?i)\bcats \& dogs\b'"
                                     matches only videos that are not live, has
                                     a like count more than 100 (or the like
                                     field is not available), and also has a
                                     description that contains the phrase "cats
                                     & dogs" (ignoring case)

                                     archive file. Record the IDs of all
                                     downloaded videos in it
    --break-on-existing              Stop the download process when encountering
                                     a file that is in the archive
    --break-on-reject                Stop the download process when encountering
                                     a file that has been filtered out

                                     use this option multiple times to give
                                     different arguments to different

                                     resulting video may have fewer artifacts
                                     around the cuts
    --no-force-keyframes-at-cuts     Do not force keyframes around the chapters
