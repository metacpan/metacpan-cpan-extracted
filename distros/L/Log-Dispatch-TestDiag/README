NAME

    Log::Dispatch::TestDiag - Log to Test::More's diagnostic output

SYNOPSIS

      use Log::Dispatch;
    
      my $logger = Log::Dispatch->new(
          outputs => [
              ['TestDiag', min_level=>'debug', as_note=>0],
          ],
      );

DESCRIPTION

    This module provides a Log::Dispatch output that spits the logged
    records out using Test::More's diagnostic output.

METHODS

    new()

      Constructs a new Log::Dispatch::TestDiag object and returns it to the
      caller. Accepts standard Log::Dispatch::Output parameters (e.g.
      min_level).

      Also accepts an optional "as_note" parameter, to indicate that output
      should be sent via Test::More::note() instead of Test::More::diag().
      Difference is that a "note" only appears in the verbose TAP stream
      and does not get shown when running under a test harness.

    log_message(%p)

      Logs the given message.
