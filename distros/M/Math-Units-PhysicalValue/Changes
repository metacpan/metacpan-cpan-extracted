1.009: Thu Feb 11 2016
   - Maybe Slaven's patch will do the trick. Here's hoping.

1.008: Tue Feb 09 2016
   - trying to resolve the test failures that result from LC_NUMERIC differing from USian ($3,000.14)
   - also, try to impose alphabetical ordering on kg*m vs m*kg

1.007: Fri May 15 07:19:12 EDT 2009
   - Math::Round apparently started detecting overflows...  I was unaware of
     them myself -- so that seems like a very good thing.

1.005: Tue Mar 31 11:18:27 EDT 2009
   - Failed to account for the fact that splitting out PV::AU
     would necessitate versioning the file... *sigh*

1.001: Tue Mar 31 09:30:54 EDT 2009
   - This is pretty mature and has worked well for me for years. 1.0
   - added chorny's META.yml stuff
   - added pv to the list of exports PV() is good, pv() is
     easier.
   - split the auto units module
   - split the pod

0.71.0: Mon May 26 16:00:12 EDT 2008
   - user version needs to be on the same line as VERSION for
     older EUMM

0.71.0: Mon May 26 16:00:12 EDT 2008
   - added version.pm

0.71:  Mon Nov  5 07:33:56 EST 2007
   - jettero fixed a bunch of bugs simultaneously by using Math::BigFloat. Why didn't I use that before?

0.68:  Mon Mar  5 13:14:55 EST 2007
   - jettero fixed a problem with num_eq, by using string comparisons...

0.67:  Sun Aug 13 07:37:44 EDT 2006
   - jettero fixed an enormous bug in PV.pm where some operations could be
     reversed if the LHS is unblessed.

0.66:  Wed May 17 21:08:59 EDT 2006
   - jettero added limited support for auto plurals ... the interface may well
     change, but I'm happy with it for now.

0.53:  Tue May 16 10:45:25 EDT 2006
   - jettero added numeric and string comparison overloads. How were these not
     in here before? Has nobody sorted a PV? I certainly hadn't.  I wonder if
     anyone uses this...

0.52:  Wed Apr 12 13:31:27 EDT 2006
   - jettero added pv_str_ne

0.51:  Sun Dec 11 08:28:15 EST 2005
   - jettero added sqrt overloads...  How did I not have this before?

0.50:  Wed Dec  7 16:18:26 EST 2005
   - jettero added the scalar-0 hack

0.49:  Thu Feb 10 11:06:09 EST 2005
   - jettero added boolean support (eg, print "no mass!\n" unless PV("0 g"))

0.48:  Mon Jan 31 07:06:15 EST 2005
   - jettero fixed a log(0) bug in the &sci function.

0.47:  Mon Jan 24 13:46:45 EST 2005
   - jettero made PV understand leading and trailing spaces better

0.46:  Thu Jan 20 10:46:50 EST 2005
   - jettero added ** (exponent) support... how did I overlook that? Seriously.

0.45:  Sun Jan 16 10:26:51 EST 2005
   - jettero added a stupid sci() to return huge numbers in exponential format

0.44:  Fri Jan 14 16:04:30 EST 2005
   - jettero added reduction to scalar support ... I thought that was working.
     I guess thats what the tests are for.  (well, they were, but they were a
     touch flakey in spots)

0.43:  Fri Jan 14 15:49:40 EST 2005
   - jettero added the deunit() function

0.42:  Fri Jan 14 15:34:38 EST 2005
   - jettero improved the number formatting for huge numbers

0.41:  Fri Jan 14 13:50:44 EST 2005
   - jettero found some exponent related bugs

0.4:  Fri Jan 14 13:06:14 EST 2005
   - jettero made a temporary fix for a Number::Format issue (ie poor handling
     of scientific notation) and also fixed a nasty bug in the unit regexp
     where capital letters went unrecognized.

0.39:  Fri Jan 14 11:00:41 EST 2005
   - jettero added exponential matching to new (eg 1.99e3) ... woops.

0.38:  Thu Jan 13 15:26:13 EST 2005
   - jettero found that metric units work well (by adding a test).

0.37:  Thu Jan 13 10:29:14 EST 2005
   - jettero added the readme

0.36:  Thu Jan 13 07:16:08 EST 2005
   - jettero better docs

0.35:  Wed Jan 12 19:58:11 EST 2005
   - jettero added a huge amount of documentation

0.34:  Wed Jan 12 16:27:12 EST 2005
   - jettero added some equivalence overloads

0.33:  Wed Jan 12 15:21:46 EST 2005
   - jettero add some num/str eq overloads

0.32:  Wed Jan 12 15:12:24 EST 2005
   - jettero made this
