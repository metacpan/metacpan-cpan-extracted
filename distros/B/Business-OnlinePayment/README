Business::OnlinePayment is a generic interface for processing payments through
online credit card processors, online check acceptance houses, etc.  (If you
like buzzwords, call it an "multiplatform ecommerce-enabling middleware
solution").

IMPORTANT: Business::OnlinePayment only defines the frontend interface to the
system, in order to use it you also need to have at least one backend
processing module installed.
