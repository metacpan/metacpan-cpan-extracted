Thomas Bayer granted use of his example under the ASF2 License.

This directory contains four examples based on the same existing remote
server.  Sorry, the server thomas-bayer.com is not available anymore:
the examples with the remote service will not work!

The server published a nice WSDL file, and a separate schema, which
have been beautified a bit but nothing more.

 . namesservice.wsdl
   The WSDL file, describing the service.

 . namesservice.xsd
   The Schema file, describing the data types transmitted.

The examples explain how to communicate to the server using certain
conditions:

 . has_wsdl.pl
   Shows how to use the WSDL file to access the server.  Of course, this
   is by far the preferred way.

 . has_schema.pl
   Do not use the WSDL file, but only use the type definitions as found in
   the schema.  Basically, a manual translation is made from the knowledge
   about the protocol (often found in some textual specification, when
   there is no WSDL) into the same structures as the WSDL produces.

Besides the above intensively documented implementations, there are also
two simplified implementations included in the package.  Those may shape
your own code, after you understand the structure.

  . has_wsdl2.pl is a simplification of has_wsdl.pl
  . has_schema2.pl is a simplification of has_schema.pl

Please contribute.
