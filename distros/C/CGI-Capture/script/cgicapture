=head1 NAME

cgicapture - Capture the CGI environment

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 > wget http://web.server/cgi-bin/cgicapture

=head1 DESCRIPTION

L<CGI::Capture> is a module used to capture and replay a full CGI
environment (primarily for debugging purposes).

B<cgicapture> is a script you can copy into your cgi-bin directory
that will capture the CGI environment and return it as a text/plain
document containing the L<CGI::Capture> object, serialized as a YAML
document.

Because B<cgicapture> is providing ALL the detailed data for your CGI
environment this is an EXTREMELY dangerous program to have in your
F<cgi-bin> from a security perspective.

You should only be using it for testing and debugging reasons, and never
on production systems more than temporarily.

=head1 SUPPORT

All bugs should be filed via the bug tracker at
