Note: the dependency upon Math::Matrix is for the
Hopfield module only. If you want to use Backprop
you can safely leave it unresolved.

If you want to perform a standard install, placing
the modules etc in the perl standard library locations,
run:
perl Makefile.PL

followed by:
make install

alternatively, if you want a local install (i.e.
placed somewhere in your home directory so only
you have access to it, perhaps you don't have 
root access) copy from this location to somewhere
handy:

perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=~
make install

and if necessary add that location to your PERL5LIB
env variable (in ~/.profile):

export PERL5LIB=$PERL5LIB:~/perl/lib/
