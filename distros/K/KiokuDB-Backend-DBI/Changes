    - Support for DBIx::Class integration (KiokuDB objects and DBIC rows can
      point to each other, DBIC resultsets can be serialized in KiokuDB)
    - All SQL operations that use placeholders now support limiting of the
      number of placeholders, splitting the operation into batches (this is
      enabled by default for SQLite which limits SQL statements to 999
      placeholders) (Jason May)

      problems with 'create => 1'

1.10  2010-03-17
    - NOTE: this was supposed to be 0.10... oops

      to be set
    - Now specifies 'longblob' instead of 'blob' as the type for the 'data'
