INTRODUCTION

Inline::SLang -- Write Perl subroutines in S-Lang.

Inline::SLang lets you write Perl subroutines in S-Lang. It dynamically 
translates the parameters and return values into native data types for 
both languages (or into Perl classes that are used to represent
S-Lang types with no direct translation to Perl).

From the S-Lang library home page at http://www.s-lang.org/

S-Lang is a multi-platform programmer's library designed to allow a
developer to create robust multi-platform software. It provides
facilities required by interactive applications such as display/screen
management, keyboard input, keymaps, and so on. The most exciting
feature of the library is the slang interpreter that may be easily
embedded into a program to make it extensible. 

Example:

   use Inline SLang => <<'END';
   define JAxH(x) {
     return sprintf( "Just Another %S Hacker!", x );
   }
   END
   print JAxH('Inline'), "\n";

When run, this complete program prints:

   Just Another Inline Hacker!

INSTALLATION

Perl requirements (see CPAN at http://search.cpan.org/):
  Perl v5.6.0 or higher.
  Test::More module (comes with perl 5.8.0)
  Inline module version 0.42 or higher.
  PDL v2.4.0 or higher will be used if installed

S-Lang requirements:
  Version 1.4.7 or higher of the S-Lang library. It has *NOT* been tested
  against version 2 of the library (and I am 100% certain it will not
  work).
  The code requires that S-Lang has been compiled with support for
  floating-point and complex numbers.

The module has only been tested on Solaris, Linux, and OS-X (10.3) 
machines.

To install Inline::SLang do this:

  $ perl Makefile.PL
  $ make
  $ make test
  $ make install

For configuration options, enter

  $ perl Makefile.PL -help

The main options of interest are -slangdir or -slanglib/inc to specify
the location of the library and its include file. The program looks in
/usr, /usr/local, and - if installed - the ots directory within the
CIAO directory structure (http:://cxc.harvard.edu/ciao/).

Note that you have to 'make install' before you can run it successfully.
