DESCRIPTION

    With this module you can easily create new FIX messages in
    human-readable way, i.e. use names like OrderQty => '499', instead of
    directly wring string like '39=499'; and vise versa, you can parse the
    gibberish FIX messages to access fields in human-readable way too.

    The module checks that mandatory fields are present, and that field
    values bypass the validation.

METHODS

  new

        new($class, $version)

    Creates new protocol instance for the specified FIX protocol version.
    Currently shipped version is 'FIX44'.

    The xml with protocol definition was taken at
    http://quickfixengine.org/.

  extension

        extension($self, $extension_path)

    Modifies the protocol, by loading XML extension.

    The extension might contain additional messages or fields. The
    extension XML should conform the format as the protocol definition
    itself, i.e.:

        <fix type='FIX' major='4' minor='4' servicepack='0'>
                <messages>
                        <message name='Logon' msgtype='A' msgcat='admin'>
                                <field name='EncryptMethod' required='Y' />
                                <field name='HeartBtInt' required='Y' />
                                <field name='ResetSeqNumFlag' required='N' />
                                <field name='Username' required='N' />
                                <field name='Password' required='N' />
                                <field name='AwesomeField' required='Y' />
                        </message>
                </messages>
                <fields>
                        <field number='33000' name='AwesomeField' type='STRING' />
                </fields>
        </fix>

  serialize_message

        serialize_message($self, $message_name, $payload)

    Returns serialized string for the supplied $message_name and $payload.
    Dies in case of end-user (developer) error, e.g. if mandatory field is
    absent.

  parse_message

        parse_message($self, $buff_ref)
    
        my ($message_instance, $error) = $protocol->parse($buff_ref);

    Tries to parse FIX message in the buffer refernce.

    In the case of success it returns MessageInstance and $error is undef.
    The string in $buff_ref will be consumed.

    In the case of protocol error, the $message_instance will be undef, and
    $error will contain the error description. The string in $buff_ref will
    be kept untouched.

    In the case, when there is no enough data in $buff_ref both $error and
    $message_instance will be undef. The string in $buff_ref will be kept
    untouched, i.e. waiting futher accumulation of bytes from network.

    In other cases it dies; that indicates either end-user (developer)
    error or bug in the module.

METHODS (for protocol developers)

  humanize

        humanize ($buffer)

    Returns human-readable string for the buffer. I.e. is just substitutes
    SOH <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C0_and_C1_control_codes> to " | ".

    This might be usable during development of own FIX-client/server.

  is_composite

        is_composite($object)

    Checks whether the supplied $object conforms "composte" concept. I.e.
    is it is Field, LGroup, Component or Mesassage.

  field_by_name

        field_by_name($self, $field_name)

    Returns Field object by it's name or dies with error.

  field_by_number

        field_by_number($self, $field_number)

    Returns Field object by it's number or dies with error.

  component_by_name

        component_by_name($self, $name)

    Returns Component object by it's name or dies with error.

  message_by_name

        message_by_name($self, $name)

    Returns Message object by it's name or dies with error.

  header

        header($self)

    Returns Message's header

  trailer

        trailer($self)

    Returns Message's trailer

  id

        id($self)

    Returns Protocol's ID string, as it appears in FIX message (BeginString
    field).

  managed_composites

        managed_composites()

    Returns list of fields, managed by protocol. Currently the list
    consists of fields: BeginString, MsgType, and CheckSum
