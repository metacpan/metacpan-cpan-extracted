Revision history for Elive

1.37   3rd November 2015
       [Elive::DAO]
       - preserve argument order on soap calls.
         This is work around restrictions with Bb::Collaborate::Multimedia
         (and Presentation). uploads Seems that arguments needs to supplied
	 in a particular order (size following upload content).

1.36   1st November 2015
       [Elive::DAO]
       - added support for class level invocation of Elive::DAO update and delete methods.

1.29   25th October 2012
       [enhancements]

       Elive::Entity::Meeting, Elive::Entity::Session, Elive::View::Meeting
       - buildJNLP() method: Tidy up of POD and argument handling.
         -- removed `version' argument; not used.
         -- added 'sessionRole' parameter.
         -- accept any one of 'userId', 'userName' or 'displayName'. In
            particular, don't default 'userId' when 'displayName' given.

       Elive::Entity::Role - added some constants:
       - ${Elive::Entity::Role::PARTICIPANT}       (3)
       - ${Elive::Entity::Role::MODERATOR}         (2)
       - ${Elive::Entity::Role::APPLICATION_ADMIN} (1)
       - ${Elive::Entity::Role::SYSTEM_ADMIN}      (0)

       - ${Elive::Entity::Participant::TYPE_USER}  (0)
       - ${Elive::Entity::Participant::TYPE_GROUP} (1)
       - ${Elive::Entity::Participant::TYPE_GUEST} (2)

       Elive::DAO
       - revert() method - Silence 'unsaved changes' warnings

1.28   12th October 2012
       [bug fixes]
       elive_raise_meeting, script-elive_raise_meeting.t
       - fixed -moderators option. These were being downgraded to regular
         participants. Added tests (bug introduced in 1.20)
       Elive::Entity::InvitedGuest, soap-session-participants.t
       - added BUILDARGS method plus string coercement (it's never had these).
         The following now works:
                Elive::Entity::InvitedGuest->new('Robert (bob@example.com)');
       [enhancements]
       Elive:
       - server_details() - Return all server(s) in a list context:
                my @servers = Elive->server_details;

1.27   14th July 2012
       [bug fixes]
       Elive::Entity::Participant
       - tightened up handling of reference structures (BUILDARGS method)
       - fixed bug with handling of invited guest objects.
       Elive::Entity::Group, Elive::Util::Type, dao-construct.t
       - Fixed element_class declaration and tightened tests to match actual
         content. Elements may be subgroups (group objects) or user-ids
         (strings).
       [testing]
       - dao-errors.t - now checks content of error messages
       - script-elive_lint_conf.t - tolerate perl 5.17.x depreciation warnings 
         (from XML::Simple <= 2.20).
       - soap-preload.t - cross-check imported preload sizes

1.26   4th May 2012
       [bug fixes]
       Elive::Entity::ParticipantList, elive_raise_meeting:
       - Fixed to align with uid (loginName) case sensitivity policies under
         LDAP and latest (ELM 11.1.2). The case of the uid is preserved on
         entry. But comparisons and uniqueness checks are case insensitive.
         -- E.g. if a user has an LDAP uid of 'johnsmith'.  Attempting to add
            'JohnSmith' now works.
         -- Note that after update, the returned participant list entry 
            contains the response uid, e.g. 'johnsmith'.

1.25   18th April 2012
       [enhancements]
       Elive::Connection
       - Added timeout option. This is passed through to the SOAP::Lite proxy object.
       [testing]
       - soap-participants.t, soap-session-participants.t - stress tests now passing.

1.24   28th February 2012
       [Tested against Blackboard Elive 11.1.2  / ELM 3.5.0.]
       [testing]
       - soap-connect.t - raised max_version to 11.1.2
       - soap-participant-list.t - long participant / stress-tests are hanging
         under LDAP. I marked these tests as TODO and added an alarm-timeout.
       [bug fixes]
       elive_query
        - removed disused _get_user() function.
        - direct 'connection error ...' message to STDERR

1.23    26th January 2012
        [enhancements]
        Elive::Entity
        - added quote() method - for quoting list() filter arguments.
        [bug fixes]
        - elive_raise_meeting: correctly handle login and group names with
          embedded single quotes, using Elive::Entity->quote().

1.22    5th January 2012
        [security]
        Elive::Util::_tidy_decimal():
        - Untaint Ints once sanitised - for consistency with Enums and Bools.
        [testing]
        - Replaced Test::Builder->new with Test::More->builder
        00load.t, soap-connect.t:
        - now bail testing if any sub tests fail
        soap-session-participants.t, soap-participant-list.t:
        - reworked long participant list tests

1.21    3rd November 2011

        [error handling]
        Elive::Entity::Participant:
        - now produces a warning if an attempt is made to assign a
          moderator role to an invited guest.
        Elive::DAO:
        - Added taintness checks to the is_changed() method; which now dies
          if any tainted data is detected.
        - is_changed() now also warns if a primary key has been updated.
        elive_raise_meeting, elive_query, elive_lint_config:
        - Changed all scripts to report usage errors to STDERR and exit
         on usage error with status code 2 [i.e. exit via pod2usage(2)].
        elive_query:
        - now dies immediately with status code 2, on command parsing error,
          when being used non-interactively.

        [testing]
        - Replaced Test::Exception with Test::Fatal

1.20    15th October 2011

        [upgrades]
        - regressions from eLive 10.0.2, which is in limited release
          (tested against ELM 3.3.2 - 3.3.5)

        [security]
        - Elive::DAO->set() - now dies when passed tainted data

        [refactoring]
        - elive_raise_meeting: replaced parse_participants() subroutine with
          Elive::Entity::Participants->new(..., -moderators..., -others...);

1.19    28th September 2011
        [bug fixes]
        - Replaced YAML with YAML::Syck. This fixed some puzzling
          compilation failures under 5.12.x and 5.14.2.

1.18    16th September 2011

        [bug fixes]
        Elive::Entity::Report
        - changed ownerId from 'Int' to 'Str' for LDAP compatibility
        - fixed delete() method to pass tests

        [enhancements]
        Elive::Entity::Report
        - insert/update of report body (xml) is still unreliable. Progressed
          slightly and updated 'Bugs & Limitations' pod.
        - fixed/updated example in pod

        [pod]
        - Documented retrieve() method for meeting parameters, server
          parameters, and participant lists
        - Documented list() method for preloads
        
1.17    9th September 2011
        [bug fixes]
        - Elive::Entity::Participant - changed user, group, guest and
          role properties to strictly hold only objects. For example,
          user property was "isa => 'Elive::Entity::User|Str'" but is
          now "isa => 'Elive::Entity::User'".

1.16    27th August 2011
        [enhancements]
        - Elive::Entity::Session - The ELM 3.x SessionInsert and SessionUpdate
          commands often return a null response rather than an error message.
          This was then leading to messy failures while unpacking. Catch
          this earlier and return (as far as possible) a more meaningful
          error message.
        [refactoring]
        - elive_query: cleaned up code for succinctness.

1.15    24th August 2011
        [enhancements]
        More work on inaccessible server details. This can indicate
        that either the session manager or license manager are not running
        and reachable.
        - Elive::Connection::SDK - error message changed to "Unable to get
          server details. Are all services running?"
        [refactoring]
        Elive is no longer a base class for Elive::DAO. This is largely for
        Elive::StandardV2's benefit, which can now base itself directly on
        Elive::DAO rather than Elive.
         - Created new module Elive::DAO::_Base
         - Changed parent class for Elive::DAO and Elive::DAO::_Array from
            Elive to Elive::DAO::_Base
         - Set $Elive::DAO::VERSION = '0.01'

1.14    21st August 2011
        [bug fixes]
        Improved detection and handling of inaccessible server details.
        This is usually an indication that the Session Server (elive) is
        not running or is unreachable.
        - Elive::Connection::SDK - was dieing with 'Can't call method
          "version" on an undefined value'. Now produces the more meaningful
          'Unable to get server details is the Session Server (elive) running?'
        - elive_query: now produces a warning and continues
        - elive_raise_meeting: now dies with this error (unable to determine
          version) unless the '-use elm2 or -use elm3' options are present.
        [testing]
        General improvements to error messages and handling when the server
        details are inaccessible - the underlying problem should now be more
        obvious to the tester.

1.13    19th August 2011
        Improved support for sites running multiple session servers.
        [enhancements]
        - Elive::Connection::SDK - the server_details() method now returns a
          list of values when used in a list context.
        - Elive::DAO - avoid attempting to cache weak (keyless) entities. This
          is for Elive::StandardV2's benefit, e.g. the serverVersions entity.
        [pod]
        - Elive::Entity::ServerDetails - documented the list() method. This
          is useful for sites that are running multiple session servers.
        [testing]
        - script-elive_query.t - removed serverDetails singleton test (there
          can be multiple servers).
        - soap-session-participants.t - fixed planning

1.12    15th August 2011
        [bug fixes]
        Elive::DAO / Elive::Entity::Recording - the 'updateRecording' command
        can return a null response (observed under ELM 3.3.4). Added code to
        Elive::DAO to check for empty update responses and defensively refetch
        the raw data to complete the update and update checks.
        [documentation]
        Elive::Entity::Recording - tidied up upload() and insert() pod
        examples.

1.11    12th August 2011
        [documentation]
        Elive::Entity::InvitedGuest - the login name, by convention, should
        be an email address. Changed pod and some tests to reflect this.

1.10    11th August 2011
        [bug fixes]
        - elive_raise_meeting: re-added default for meeting name (left out
          with Elive 1.09).

1.09    10th August 2011
        [compatibility]
        Further support for Elluminate Live version >= 9.0.0 < 9.5.0
        - elive_raise_meeting: Reintroduced automatic selection of session
          class based on version (see rev 0.96), but this time against
          earlier Elluminate Live! versions
          -- Elive::Entity::Session (-user elm3) is the default for
             Elluminate Live! >= 9.5.0
          -- Elive::View::Session (-use elm2) is otherwise the default

        [testing]
        removed $TEST_AUTHOR check from all script-*.t tests
        script-elive_raise_meeting.t - skip elm3 tests for Elluminate < 9.5

1.08    9th August 2011
        [compatibility]
        I regression tested against Elluminate 9.0 to check results.
        - Recording and groups had some problems and failing tests
        - I skipped all tests that involve Elive::Entity::Session. It
          wasn't usable (as expected).
        - Elive::View::Session worked pretty well, after one minor bug fix
          (see below).
        - I made some modifications to the soap-connect.t to treat 9.0 as the
          mininum supported version and 9.5+ as the recommended version.

        Under Elive 10.0.1+ the getUser command (Elive::Entity::User retrieve
        method) matches on both userId and loginName.
        - I relaxed the _readback() consistency checks to allow this.  Also,
          added tests to soap-user.t to capture this behaviour.

       [bug fixes]
       - Elive::Entity::Session - the retrieve() method now returns undef when
         an attempt is made to access a non-existent meeting. This fix was
         sufficient to pass all Elive::View::Session tests on Elluminate 9.0.

1.07    7th August 2011
        [compatibility]
        Some failures were detected when running soap-user.t and soap-group.t
        tests against earlier ELM 3.0 / Elive 9.5 servers. These were caused
        by attempting to parse 'domain' and 'groups' properties that were seen
        in early 3.0 responses. Some changes were made to silently ignore
        these properties.
        - Elive::DAO, Elive::Util - add 'Any' datatype for ignored properties
        - elive_query - ignore fields of type 'Any'
        - Elive::Entity::User - declare 'groups' and 'domain' as type 'Any'
        - Elive::Entity::User - declare 'domain' as type 'Any'
        Will monitor these properties in new releases.
        [bug fixes]
        elive_query - reverted use of Try::Tiny based on perl 5.8.3 regressions

1.06    6th August 2011
        [enhancements]
        elive_raise_meeting - added -all_moderators option
        [refactoring]
        - renamed class Elive::Array to Elive::DAO::Array. The old class name
          can still be referenced , but now produces a depreciated warning.
        [testing]
        - corrected occasional bogus failures (invalid ID generation) in
          mock tests.

1.05    1st August 2011
        [bug fixes]
        Elive::Entity::Session - corrected handling of invited guests in
        insert() and update () methods
        - Corrected SOAP delimiter for invited guests list from ',' to ';'
        - Disallow promotion of Invited guests to moderator, ie
          $participant->is_moderator(1) has no effect when the participant
          is a group ($participant->type == 1).

1.04    28th July 2011

        [security]
        Essential changes to improve general security and play better with
        Perl's Taint mode. Elive now dies when any attempt is made to
        construct a request from tainted strings.
        - These changes will only have an impact when taint is enabled,
          e.g. '-T' has been passed as a perl option.
        - Taint checking is limited to outgoing strings (Str) in SOAP requests.
        - Neither booleans (Bool) or integers (Int) are checked. However both
          Int and Bool are sanitised when building SOAP requests.
        - No attempt is made to apply taint checking to incoming data from
          SOAP::Lite requests.

        Elive::Util::_freeze() - Any attempts to freeze tainted strings
          (type Str) while in taint mode now results in an error
        Elive::DAO::list() - the 'filter' parameter is now frozen to avoid
          bypassing taintness checks.
        Elive::Entity::Recording, Elive::Entity::Preload - all SOAP
          parameters are now frozen and taint checks are applied.

        Dropped dependency on Storable::dclone; replaced with Clone::clone.
        - Storable::dclone doesn't seem to honor taintness, whereas
          Clone::clone does.

       [enhancements]
       Elive::Entity::Recording - added BUILDARGS method. 'size' is now
       computed and doesn't need to be specified in upload()s.
       Elive::Entity::ParticipantList - moved update checks to
       _readback_checks() for the benefit of Elive::Entity::Session.

1.03    24th July 2011

        [enhancements]
        elive_raise_meeting - added '--dump=yaml' option

        [pod]
        A few minor corrections to Elive::Entity::Session pod.    

1.02    21st July 2011

        [pod]
        Noted insert() and update() methods as undergoing depreciation for
        meetings, meeting parameters, server parameters and participant lists.

        [enhancements]
        Elive::Entity::Participant
        - added is_participant() setter/getter
        Elive::Entity:Role
        - added BUILDARGS() method and simplified coercements.

        [bug fixes]
        Elive::Entity::User
        - corrected ineffective BUILDARGS() method.

1.01    20th July 2011
        [bug fixes]
        Elive::Entity::Preload
        - removed legacy method Elive::Entity::Preload::_freeze(). This was
          interfering with readback checks.
        [documentation]
        README
        - Amendments to section 'Configuring SDK Access'
        Elive
        - Amendments to introductory example POD

1.00    19th July 2011
        [Regression tested against Elm 3.0 / Elive 9.5 (earliest supported
         version). Back-ported recently introduced Elive::Entity::Session
         to  Elm 3.0+. Other minor changes for compatibility.].
        Elive
        - amended introductory example POD to create a meeting using
          Elive::Entity::Session (was using Elive::View::Session).
        elive_raise_meeting
        - now unconditionally uses Elive::Entity::Session as the default
          class for raising meetings (-use elm3).
        soap-recording.t
        - skipped some failing download tests for Elm <= 3.0.
        Elive::Entity::ServerParameters
        - included some aliases for misspellings present in Elm 3.0 responses
          (sic) ModertatorTelephonyAddress, ModertatorTelephonyPIN
        [Minor refactorings]
        - added _restful_url() method to Elive::DAO. Inherited and
          overridden by Elive::Entity::Group.
        [README]
        - Manual configuration instructions amended - only needed for LDAP
