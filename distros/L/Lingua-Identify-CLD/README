Lingua-Identify-CLD

These are Perl bindings to CLD, the Compact Language Detection library
from Google/Chrome.

While CLD is not available as a standard package with a standard build
system, I am shiping the code in the tarball. For details on the
library check
  http://code.google.com/p/chromium-compact-language-detector/

Note that you will require a C compiler to build the library and the bindings.
