# All worker pools running on this host must be defined here, specifying 
# which logical bus should be used and which services it will run. In this
# example only one worker pool (named "myapp") is defined.
#
# Each pool definition must contain the following parameters:
#
#  - pool_id : arbitrary identifier of worker pool
#  - bus_id  : identifier of logical bus used by worker processes
#  - workers : a map of worker classes and its config hashes
#
# To start the worker pool use the "bkpr" command:
#
# $ bkpr --pool "myapp" start
