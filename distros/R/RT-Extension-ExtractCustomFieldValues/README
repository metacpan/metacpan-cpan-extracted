NAME
    RT::Extension::ExtractCustomFieldValues - extract CF values from email
    headers or body

RT VERSION
    Works with RT 4.0, 4.2, 4.4, 5.0, 6.0

DESCRIPTION
    ExtractCustomFieldValues provides an "ExtractCustomFieldValues" scrip
    action, which can be used to scan incoming emails to set values of
    custom fields.

INSTALLATION
    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make install
        May need root permissions

    make initdb
        Only run this the first time you install this module.

        If you run this twice, you may end up with duplicate data in your
        database.

        If you are upgrading this module, check for upgrading instructions
        in case changes need to be made to your database.

    Edit your /opt/rt6/etc/RT_SiteConfig.pm
        If you are using RT 4.2 or greater, add this line:

            Plugin('RT::Extension::ExtractCustomFieldValues');

        For RT 4.0, add this line:

            Set(@Plugins, qw(RT::Extension::ExtractCustomFieldValues));

        or add RT::Extension::ExtractCustomFieldValues to your existing
        @Plugins line.

    Restart your webserver

USAGE
    To use the ScripAction, create a Template and a Scrip in RT. Your new
    Scrip should use a ScripAction of 'Extract Custom Field Values'. The
    Template consists of the lines which control the scanner. All
    non-comment lines are of the following format:

        <cf-name>|<Headername>|<MatchString>|<Postcmd>|<Options>

    where:

    *cf-name*
        The name of a custom field (must be created in RT). If this field is
        blank, the match will be run and Postcmd will be executed, but no
        custom field will be updated. Use this if you need to execute other
        RT code based on your match.

    *Headername*
        Either a Name of an email header, "body" to scan the body of the
        email or "headers" to search all of the headers.

    *MatchString*
        A regular expression to find a match in the header or body. If the
        MatchString matches a comma separated list and the CF is a
        multi-value CF then each item in the list is added as a separate
        value.

    *Postcmd*
        Perl code to be evaluated on $value, where $value is either $1 or
        full match text from the match performed with <MatchString>

    *Options*
        A string of letters which may control some aspects. Possible options
        include:

        *q* - (quiet)
            Don't record a transaction when adding the custom field value

        *** - (wildcard)
            The MatchString regex should contain _two_ capturing groups, the
            first of which is the CF name, the second of which is the value.
            If this option is given, the <cf-name> field is ignored.
            (Supercedes '+'.)

        *+* - (multiple)
            The MatchString regex will be applied with the /g option and all
            matching values will be added to the CF, which should probably
            be a multi-value CF for best results. (Superceded by '*'.)

  Separator
    You can change the separator string (initially "\|") during the template
    with:

        Separator=<anyregexp>

    Changing the separator may be necessary, if you want to use a "|" in one
    of the patterns in the controlling lines.

  ValueSeparator
    You can change the separator string for multi-value customfields
    (initially ",") in the template with:

            ValueSeparator=<anyregexp>

    Changing the mult-value separator may be necessary since your source may
    use a list of values separated by spaces or ', ' or ';' etc.

  Examples
    For reference, a template with these examples is also installed during
    make initdb. See the CustomFieldScannerExample template for examples and
    further documentation. The installed template also makes it easy to cut
    and paste the examples into your own template.

    1. Put the content of the "X-MI-Test" header into the "testcf" custom
    field:
            testcf|X-MI-Test|.*

    2. Scan the body for Host:name and put name into the "bodycf" custom
    field:
            bodycf|Body|Host:\s*(\w+)

    3. Scan the "X-MI-IP" header for an IP-Adresse and get the hostname by
    reverse-resolving it:
            Hostname|X-MI-IP|\d+\.\d+\.\d+\.\d+|use Socket; ($value) = gethostbyaddr(inet_aton($value),AF_INET);

    4. scan the "CC" header for an many email addresses, and add them to a
    custom field named "parsedCCs". If "parsedCCs" is a multivalue CF, then
    this should yield separate values for all email adress found.
            parsedCCs|CC|.*|$value =~ s/^\s+//; $value =~ s/\s+$//;

    5. Looks for an "Email:" field in the body of the email, then loads up
    that user and makes them privileged The blank first field means the
    automatic CustomField setting is not invoked.
            |Body|Email:\s*(.+)$|my $u = RT::User->new($RT::SystemUser); $u->LoadByEmail($value); $u->SetPrivileged(1)|

    6. Looks for any text of the form "Set CF Name: Value" in the body, and
    sets the CF named "CF Name" to the given value, which may be multi-line.
    The '*' option controls the wildcard nature of this example.
            Separator=!
            !Body!^Set ([^\n:]*?):\s*((?s).*?)(?:\Z|\n\Z|\n\n)!!*

    7. Looks for the regex anywhere in the headers and stores the match in
    the AllHeaderSearch CF
            AllHeaderSearch|Headers|Site:\s*(\w+)

    8. If you need to dynamically build your matching, and want to trigger
    on headers and body and invode some arbitrary code like example 5
            Separator=~~
        {
            my $action = 'use My::Site; My::Site::SetSiteID( Ticket => $self->TicketObj, Site => $_ );';

            for my $regex (My::Site::ValidRegexps) {
                for my $from ('headers', 'body') {
                    $OUT .= join '~~',
                        '', # CF name
                        $from,
                        $regex,
                        $action;
                   $OUT .= "\n";
               }
           }
        }
