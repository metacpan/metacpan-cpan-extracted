# DESCRIPTION

Text::Conversation attempts to thread conversational text one line at
a time.  Given a speaker's ID (often a name, screen name, or other
relatively unique identifier) and the text of their message, it
attempts to find the most likely message they are referring to.  It
will also indicate times when it cannot find a referent.

The most common question so far is "How does it work?"  That's often
followed by the leading "Does it just look for another speaker's ID at
the start of the message?"  Text::Conversation uses multiple
heuristics to determine a message's referent.  To be sure, the
presence of another speaker's ID counts for a lot, but so do common
words between two messages.  Consider them similar to quoted text in
an e-mail message.

Text::Conversation also keeps track of people who have spoken to each
other, either explicitly or implicitly.  Chances are good that an
otherwise undirected message is aimed at a person and is part of an
ongoing conversation.

The module also incorporates penalties.  The link between two messages
is degraded more as the module searches farther back in time.
Likewise, there are penalties for referring to messages beyond the
speaker's previous message, or the addressee's.

Text::Conversation is considered by its author to be "beta" quality
code.  The heuristics are often uncannily accurate... if you
steadfastly ignore their shortcomings.  I am trapped in a module
factory.  Please send feedback and patches.

# INTERFACE

So, like, what are the methods?  So far the module only supports
these.  I'm sure others will emerge as people use the module.

- new NAMED\_PARAMETERS

    Create and return a new Text::Conversation object.  The constructor
    takes a few parameters, specified as name/value pairs.  All the
    parameters are optional.

    Here's a constructor that uses all the parameters.  Unfortunately, the
    coder has sillily used all the default values when writing it.

    	my $threader = Text::Conversation->new(
    		debug         => 0,
    		thread_buffer => 30,
    	);

    "debug" turns on a lot of warnings that most people won't be
    interested in to begin with.  They may become curious and enable it
    after they come to realize the module often does a lousy job of
    threading.  Please roll 1d4, and subtract that number from your Sanity
    if you enable debugging.

    "thread\_buffer" sets the number of messages that the module keeps in
    its short-term memory.  These messages are the ones considered when
    looking for referents.  If you're looking for an analogy, consider it
    the number of messages that fit or your terminal, and you can't scroll
    back.  When someone says something peculiar, and you skim your screen
    for what the heck they're talking about, there's only "thread\_buffer"
    number of messages visible.

    The thread buffer shouldn't be too large.  Messages are penalized the
    farther back they are in time, so a huge buffer just consumes memory
    with little or no gain.  The default of 30 lines seems sane today.

- observe SPEAKER\_ID, SPEAKER\_TEXT

    Ask Text::Conversation to observe a "spoken" message.  observe()
    returns two values: the unique ID of this new message, and the ID of
    the message the speaker is most likely referring to.  If we're lucky,
    the referent ID is actually meaningful.

    Oh, if Text::Conversation decides they're just spouting into the void
    (that is, what they've said doesn't refer to anything in its
    short-term memory), then the referent ID is undefined.  I hope the
    example in the SYNOPSIS adequately portrays this behavior.

    	my ($new_message_id, $referent_id) = $threader->observe(
    		$screen_name, $what_they_said
    	);

    	if (defined $referent_id) {
    		print "They're referring to message '$referent_id'.\n";
    	}
    	else {
    		print "Uh-oh.  $screen_name is on their soapbox again.\n";
    	}

# BUGS

Text::Conversation is considered beta code.  Thank Ford it's not
alpha!  The threading heuristics are interesting, and sometimes they
are surprisingly effective, but they aren't perfect.

This module's locale is hardcoded for English.  Please send patches to
support your native tongue if you cannot read this.

Consecutive messages by the same author, where the subsequent messages
begin with conjunctions, are most likely a monologue.  The subsequent
messages are more likely to address the same destination as the first
one.  LotR suggested this.  And I believe he's right.

At least in Perl-related IRC channels there is a convention whereby
people "correct" previous messages by stating simple substitutions.
For example:

	<bynari> my butt hurts
	<bynari> s/butt/head/

The second message states that the previous message was in error, and
"butt" should be replaced with "head".

The module doesn't consider periods of time where a speaker is not
present.  It will happily link someone's message to a thread they
couldn't possibly have known about.  Be careful fixing this one:
Someone may arrive and immediately refer to a thread that occurred
before they left.

If an unaddressed message matches a message farther back in a thread,
perhaps they're referring to something farther along that branch.

	01 <one> A lot of creatures really don't know how to deal with a
			glue trap.  They do that tarbaby thing with increasing
			desperation.
	02 <two> yeah.  so, imagine bambi stuck to one.
	03 <three> I am imagining my neighbors in a glue
			trap...frantically rolling around trying to get free yet picking
			up various objects in their struggle ... (hey...this sounds
			familiar...)
	04 <two> hee
	05 <one> Like that game!
	06 <three> Yeah! But with our NEIGHBORS!
	07 <three> (comic relief IN MY MIND)

At the time of this writing, this conversation threaded like this:

	01 <one> A lot of creatures....
		02 <two> yeah.  so, ....
		03 <three> I am imagining ....
		04 <two> hee
			05 <one> Like that game!
				07 <three> (comic relief....
		06 <three> Yeah! But....

It should instead thread like this:

	01 <one> A lot of creatures....
		02 <two> yeah.  so, ....
			03 <three> I am imagining ....
				04 <two> hee
				05 <one> Like that game!
					06 <three> Yeah! But....
					07 <three> (comic relief....

The problem occurs in the rule where "If a message's referent is by
the same speaker, then set the current referent to the referent of the
previous message."  In the broken case, 06 refers to 03 (by the same
person), so it's "fixed" to point to 01 (because 03 refers to that).

There are probably other things.
