NAME
    pgloader.pl - loads data to Postgres tables

SYNOPSIS
      pgloader.pl  -siTV  person 
      pgloader.pl  --help

DESCRIPTION
    *pgloader.pl* loads tables to a Postgres database. It is similar to the
    pgloader(1) python program, written by other authors. Data are read from
    the file specified in the configuration file (defaults to pgloader.dat).

    This version of pgloader exhibits the -i option which (when activated)
    drops all table indexes and recreates them again after COPY. In case of
    errors, everything rolls back to the initial state. This version also
    allows the libpq 'service' database connection method.

    The configuration file and command options are almost identical to the
    python pythod pgloader(1) and is meant to be a drop-in replacement.
    Configuration entries are ignored for unimplemented features. The core
    functionality and many usefull features are already implemented; read
    further to find what is currently available.

CONFIGURATION FILE
    The configuration file (default is pgloader.conf), follows the ini
    configuration format, and is divided into these sections:

    [pgslq]
        This section is the only mandatory section, and defines how to
        access the database.

	 base          [required]  name of the database
	 host          [optional]  hostname to connect. Default is 'localhost'
	 port          [optional]  port number. Default is 5432
	 user          [optional]  name of login user. Default is epid of user
	 pass          optional]  user password. Not needed with libpq defaults.
	 pgsysconfdir  [optional]  dir for PGSYSCONFDIR
	 service       mandatory only when pgsysconfdir ( or the enviromental
		       variable PGSYSCONFDIR ) is defined .

    [template1]
        This section defines templates. In this case, the name was arbitrary
        chosen as template1. The purpose of templates is to hold default
        values for other table sections (defined bellow). You may define an
        unlimited number of template sections. The only mandatory entry for
        this section is 'template':

         template   when defined, the template as enabled; leave it blank 
                    to disable it.

    [person]
        This is the table section. The name person was arbitrary chosen,
        you can define an unlimited number of table sections. If the name of
        a table section appears on the command line (when invoking
        pgloader.pl) the corresponding table section defines how to load
        this table. Try to keep the name of the section the same as the name
        of the table. In a table section you can define the following
        parameters:


 table                [ MANDATORY ]  Tablename or schema.tablename .
                      Defaults to section name.

 filename             [ OPTIONAL ]  Filename with data for the table
                      If missing, or set to 'STDIN', input data should
                      arrive from standard input.

 use_template         [ OPTIONAL ]   Template to use for default values.

 field_sep            Delimiter that separates fields. The default for
                      text formats is TAB, and for csv formats is ','

 format               [ OPTIONAL ]   Must be either 'text' or 'csv' (without
                      the quotes). Default is text.

 copy                 [ OPTIONAL ]   Names of columns found in data file.
                      The names must match those in the database table.
                      Defauls to * . If you don't wish to list the names
                      in there proper order, you must append a number next
                      to their name; useful when the data file contains data
                      data in different order.
                      Example:  copy = age, last, first
                                copy = first:3, age:1, last:2

copy_columns          [ OPTIONAL ]    Names of columns to use for COPY.
                      The char '*' means all columns specified with
                      the "copy" parameter; carefull, it does not mean
                      all columns defined for the database table, for it
                      would not make sence, much or little.  Default is '*',
                      again, this means, same as "copy".  For this parameter,
                      names need not obey a particular order.
                      Example:  copy_columns = first, last, age
                                copy_columns = *

update                [ OPTIONAL ]   Names of columns found in data file.
                      By including this tag, you are switching to the UPDATE
                      mode for the purpose to change some (or all) fields
                      of an existing row. Updates are allowed only if the
                      the table contains primary keys.
                      The format and semantics are identical to "copy".

update_copy           [ OPTIONAL ]    Names of columns for the update mode.
                      The format and semantics are identical to "copy_columns".

reject_data           [ OPTIONAL ]    Specifies the pathname for the file
                      that records rejected data. 

reject_log            [ OPTIONAL ]    Specifies the pathname for the file
                      that records diagnostics. 



 only_cols            [ OPTIONAL ]    Same purpose as "copy_columns", but here
                      we use numbers (instead of names), to specify the
                      columns. Numbers start from 1, ranges are also allowed.
                      The char '*' means all columns, and is the default.
                      Example: only_cols = 1-2, 3, 5
                               only_cols = 3

 quotechar            [ OPTIONAL ]    Usefull only for csv formats. Default is "
 null                 [ OPTIONAL ]    String that indicates the  NULL value ;
                      usefull only for text mode. Default is string '\NA'

skipinitialspace      [ OPTIONAL ]    Ignore leading and trailing whitespace

udc_COLUMNAME         [ OPTIONAL ]    Assign this value for all rows whose name
                      is column COLUMNAME
                      Examples: udc_title = Sir
                                udc_age   = 99
                                udc_race  = white

reformat              [ OPTIONAL ]    reformat values of the age column by
                      passing it to function upper(), in the John::Util
                      module reformat = age:John::Util::upper

copy_every            [ OPTIONAL ]    How many tuples to copy per transaction.
                      More transactions are automatically created to
                      insert the rest of the date, each inserting
                      upto that many tuples. Defaults is 10_000
                      TIP: set this parameter to 1 if you wish
                      to avoid the case where one bad tuple
                      cause other tuples to also fail.
datestyle             [ OPTIONAL ]   Set datestyle parameter, omit all quotes.
                      Example:  datestyle=euro
                                datestyle=us

client_encoding       [ OPTIONAL ]   Set client encoding, omit all quotes.
lc_messages           [ OPTIONAL ]   Set lc messages parameter, omit all quotes.
lc_monetary           [ OPTIONAL ]   Set lc monetary, omit all quotes.
lc_time               [ OPTIONAL ]   Set lc time, omit all quotes.


NOTE: Because of how the ini format is defined as a value separator,
if you need to include the , char, you must escape it with \ . For
example:
 field_sep = \,          sets field_sep to char ','
