Carp-Always version 0.16
========================

Carp::Always can be used to make a script complain loudly
with stack traces when warn()ing or die()ing.

  perl -MCarp::Always script.pl


Perl has Carp which is a module as old as Perl 5. It has
an option to print errors (from the perspective of caller)
with stack backtrace. With a few lines of codes, this module
illustrates how to make warn() and die() noisy as well.

This module was written as a reaction to Acme::JavaTrace by
Sébastien Aperghis-Tramoni. At the time I didn't know Sébastien or
or understood his humor. But the module
idea stood and lives to help you out with debugging your code.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:
