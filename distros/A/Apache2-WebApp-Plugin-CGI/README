    Apache2::WebApp::Plugin::CGI - Plugin providing common CGI methods

SYNOPSIS
      my $obj = $c->plugin('CGI')->method( ... );     # Apache2::WebApp::Plugin::CGI->method()

        or

      $c->plugin('CGI')->method( ... );

DESCRIPTION
    Common methods for dealing with HTTP requests.

PREREQUISITES
    This package is part of a larger distribution and was NOT intended to be
    used directly. In order for this plugin to work properly, the following
    packages must be installed:

      Apache2::WebApp
      Params::Validate

INSTALLATION
    From source:

      $ tar xfz Apache2-WebApp-Plugin-CGI-0.X.X.tar.gz
      $ perl MakeFile.PL PREFIX=~/path/to/custom/dir LIB=~/path/to/custom/lib
      $ make
      $ make test
      $ make install

    Perl one liner using CPAN.pm:

      $ perl -MCPAN -e 'install Apache2::WebApp::Plugin::CGI'

    Use of CPAN.pm in interactive mode:

      $ perl -MCPAN -e shell
      cpan> install Apache2::WebApp::Plugin::CGI
      cpan> quit

    Just like the manual installation of Perl modules, the user may need
    root access during this process to insure write permission is allowed
    within the installation directory.

OBJECT METHODS
  params
    Get the request paramters; return name/value parameters as a hash.

      my %param = $c->plugin('CGI')->params(\%controller);

  redirect
    Redirect an HTTP request to a target URI or URL.

      $c->plugin('CGI')->redirect( \%controller, $target );
