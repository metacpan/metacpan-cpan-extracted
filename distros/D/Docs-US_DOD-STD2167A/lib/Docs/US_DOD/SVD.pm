=head1 DATA ITEM DESCRIPTION

The following establishes the data general and content
requirements for the identified data item. 

=head1 1. TITLE

SOFTWARE VERSION DESCRIPTION (SVD)

=head1 2. IDENTIFICATION NUMBER

DI-IPSC-81442

=head1 3. DESCRIPTION/PURPOSE

The Software Version Description (SVD) identifies
and describes a software version consisting of one or more Computer
Software Configuration Items (L<CSCI>). It is used to release, track,
and control software versions. 

The term 'version' may be applied to the
initial release of the software, to a subsequent release of that
software, or to one of multiple forms of the software released
at approximately the same time (for example, to different sites).

=head1 7. APPLICATION/INTERRELATIONSHIP

This Data Item Description (DID) contains the
format and content preparation instructions for the data product
generated by specific and discrete task requirements as delineated
in the contract.

This DID is used when the developer is tasked
to identify and record the exact version of software to be delivered
to a user, support, or other site. 

The Contract Data Requirements List (L<CDRL>) should
specify whether deliverable data are to be delivered on paper
or electronic media; are to be in a given electronic form (such
as ASCII, CALS, or compatible with a specified word processor
or other support software); may be delivered in developer format
rather than in the format specified herein; and may reside in
computer-aided software engineering (CASE) or other automated
tool rather than in the form of a traditional document. 

This DID supersedes DI-MCCR-80013A and DI-MCCR-80312.

=head1 10. PREPARATION INSTRUCTIONS 


=head2 10.1 General instructions.


=head2 10.1.1 Automated techniques.

Use of automated techniques
is encouraged. The term 'document' in this DID means
a collection of data regardless of its medium. 

=head2 10.1.2 Alternate presentation styles.

Diagrams, tables,
matrices, and other presentation styles are acceptable substitutes
for text when data required by this DID can be made more readable
using these styles. 

=head2 10.1.3 Title page or identifier with signature blocks.

The document shall include a title page containing, as applicable:
document number; volume number; version/revision indicator; security
markings or other restrictions on the handling of the document;
date; document title; name, abbreviation, and any other identifier
for the systems, subsystems, or items to which the document applies;
contract number; CDRL item number; organization for which the
document has been prepared; name and address of the preparing
organization; distribution statement; and signature blocks for
the developer representative authorized to release the document,
the acquirer representative authorized to approve the document,
and the dates of release/approval. For data in a database or other
alternative form, this information shall be included on external
and internal labels or by equivalent identification methods.

=head2 10.1.4 Table of contents. 

The document shall contain
a table of contents providing the number, title, and page number
of each titled paragraph, figure, table, and appendix. For data
in a database or other alternative form, this information shall
consist of an internal or external table of contents containing
pointers to, or instructions for accessing, each paragraph, figure,
table, and appendix or their equivalents. 

=head2 10.1.5 Page numbering/labeling. 

Each page shall contain
a unique page number and display the document number, including
version, volume, and date, as applicable. For data in a database
or other alternative form, files, screens, or other entities shall
be assigned names or numbers in such a way that desired data can
be indexed and accessed. 

=head2 10.1.6 Response to tailoring instructions. 

If a paragraph
is tailored out of this DID, the resulting document shall contain
the corresponding paragraph number and title, followed by 'This
paragraph has been tailored out.' For data in a database
or other alternative form, this representation need occur only
in the table of contents or equivalent. 

=head2 10.1.7 Multiple paragraphs and subparagraphs. 

Any section, paragraph, or subparagraph in this DID may be written
as multiple paragraphs or subparagraphs to enhance readability.

=head2 10.1.8 Standard data descriptions. 

If a data description
required by this DID has been published in a standard data element
dictionary specified in the contract, reference to an entry in
that dictionary is preferred over including the description itself.

=head2 10.1.9 Substitution of existing documents.

Commercial or other existing documents may be substituted for all or part
of the document if they contain the required data. 

=head2 10.2 Content requirements.

Content requirements begin on the following page. The numbers
shown designate the paragraph numbers to be used in the document.
Each such number is understood to have the prefix '10.2'
within this DID. For example, the paragraph numbered 1.1 is understood
to be paragraph 10.2.1.1 within this DID.

=head1 1 Scope.

This section shall be divided into
the following paragraphs.

=head2 1.1 Identification.

This paragraph shall contain a full
identification of the system and the software to which this document
applies, including, as applicable, identification number(s), title(s),
abbreviation(s), version number(s), and release number(s). It
shall also identify the intended recipients of the SVD to the
extent that this identification affects the contents of the software
released (for example, source code may not be released to all
recipients.)

=head2 1.2 System overview.

This paragraph shall briefly state
the purpose of the system and the software to which this document
applies. It shall describe the general nature of the system and
software; summarize the history of system development, operation,
and maintenance; identify the project sponsor, acquirer, user,
developer, and support agencies; identify current and planned
operating sites; and list other relevant documents.

=head2 1.3 Document overview.

This paragraph shall summarize the
purpose and contents of this document and shall describe any security
or privacy considerations associated with its use.

=head1 2 Referenced documents.

This section shall list the number,
title, revision, and date of all documents referenced in this
document. This section shall also identify the source for all
documents not available through normal Government stocking activities.

=head1 3 Version description.
