This is the README for Lingua::JA::Moji version 0.59.

Lingua::JA::Moji is a "module" for the Perl computer programming language,
a library of computer code to install on a computer.  This document
contains four sections:

1. About - what the module does

2. Documentation - how to learn more about the module

3. Installation - how to install this module on a computer

4. Help - what to do if you get stuck

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. ABOUT

Lingua::JA::Moji - Handle many kinds of Japanese characters

This module provides methods to convert different written forms of
Japanese into one another. It enables conversion between romanized
Japanese, hiragana, and katakana. It also includes a number of unusual
encodings such as Japanese braille and morse code, as well as
conversions between Japanese and Cyrillic and Hangul. It also handles
conversion between the Chinese characters (kanji) used before and
after the character reforms of 1949, as well as the various bracketed
and circled forms of kana and kanji.

All the functions in this module assume the use of Unicode
encoding. All input and output strings must be encoded using Perl's
"UTF-8" format.

The module loads the various data format conversion files on demand,
thus the various obscure conversions hopefully do not cause a memory
burden.

This module does not handle the conversion of kanji words into kana,
or kana into kanji.
