=head1 NAME

brewbuild.conf - Optional configuration file for the C<Test::BrewBuild>
build system.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

By default, an example C<brewbuild.conf-dist> configuration file is copied into
C<~/brewbuild> directory upon installation.

To use a configuration file, copy the C<brewbuild.conf-dist> file to
C<brewbuild.conf> within the same directory, and edit it accordingly.

Command line arguments will override whatever configuration you have in the
config file.
