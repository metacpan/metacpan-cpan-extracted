* v1.8 - May 10, 1997

Removed $` and $' from the code, and "optimized" an important regexp.
As a result, the module is much more efficient. Fixed a minor bug in 
multipart boundary parsing. Corrected an error when storing a key that 
has multiple values which caused more than one array to be allocated. 
Just a note: if you call get_multiple_values method with a scalar
value, the method no longer returns an undef, but the value itself.

As of this version, you can pass a request method (optional) to the 
parse_form_data method. This gives you a bit more flexibility when 
dealing with forms.

The set_file_type method now works as it should. In earlier versions,
CGI_Lite created "handles" in all cases. Added the close_all_files
method to close uploaded files that are opened as a result of passing
"handle" to set_file_type.

The print_form_data and print_cookie_data are deprecated as of this
version, but have not been removed (for compatibility reasons). It's 
better to use the print_data method, which prints the key/value pairs 
in the order they were parsed. As a side effect of this change,
if you want to parse form data and cookies in an application,
you have to create two instances of the CGI_Lite object, which
only makes sense.

Added the get_ordered_keys method which will return the list
of _keys_ in the order in which they were parsed. Modified the
wrap_textarea method; it now works properly.

Also, added the add_mime_type, remove_mime_type and get_mime_types
methods to deal with EOL translation based on MIME types. Added
the filter_filename method to alter the way in which uploaded
files are named. Added the add_timestamp method which allows you 
to turn off timestamps on uploaded files. NOTE: CGI_Lite no longer 
returns the full path of the uploaded file, but simply, the file name.

Added a set of miscellaneous functions: browser_escape, url_encode,
url_decode, is_dangerous, escape_dangerous_chars. CGI_Lite now handles
errors better; you can use the newly implemented is_error, and 
get_error_message methods. I've bought back the return_error
method, which you can use to return errors to the browser and
exit. However, this method no longer outputs the HTTP header,
as it did in versions prior to v1.7.

In addition, this version allows you to debug your CGI scripts
"offline" by letting you pass query information through standard
input. I got this idea from CGI.pm, though it's handled a bit
differently. Thanks Lincoln!

* v1.7 - December 28, 1996

Maybe, I should release this version as 2.0 :-) There were a lot of 
changes made:

    - *Totally* re-wrote the multipart form parsing algorithm. It's
      _much_ more efficient with large uploads. It still needs tweaking
      to remove the $` and $' -- maybe in the next release.
    - Multiple values per field are no longer returned as a null-character
      delimited string. Instead, a reference to an array is returned.
      You need to de-reference, or call the get_multiple_values method
      to get at the array. There was no way I could make this backward
      compatible. Please check your scripts, because a few might break.
      I apologize.
    - Fields containing more than one value in multipart forms are now
      handled correctly.      
    - Added the wrap_textarea method that allows you to neatly "wrap" 
      long strings.
    - You can now parse/decode cookies in much the same manner as forms.
    - When saving uploaded files, the module adds a timestamp. As of this
      version, the timestamp is added to the front of the file,
      as opposed to the end, so that file extensions are preserved.
      Note: this module makes no effort to URL decode the filename for
      security reasons.
    - Added the following new methods: set_buffer_size, parse_cookies,
      print_cookie_data, wrap_textarea, get_multiple_values and
      create_variables.
    - Removed the return_error subroutine and, instead, added _error,
      which dumps a message to STDERR and dies.
    - You can now install this module in a convenient manner. Also,
      fixed up the docs, moved this list of revisions from the module
      to a separate file, and added a directory with simple examples.
    - Fixed up numerous little bugs, including the "Use of uninitialized..."
      warnings.

* v1.62 - January 17, 1996

Modified the parse_multipart_data subroutine so that it
returns the name of the file as the filehandle -- if set_file_type
function is called with the "handle" parameter.

Added the function determine_package to determine the 
calling package.

* v1.61 - January 1, 1996

Fixed a minor bug that resulted in end of line characters being removed
from certain binary files.

* v1.6 - December 30, 1995

Added code to handle other header information that the browser might
send after the "Content-Disposition" header.

Added set_platform function so that uploaded text files display
properly.

The function set_file_type no longer returns a status.

Fixed spacing within code.

* v1.5 - November 13, 1995

Corrected two major bugs that caused several fields to be lost (when
the fields before them were either too small or too large).

Added code to make sure that there are no "\r\n" characters in the
regular form fields. Textarea elements and fields that contain uploaded
information from different platforms (i.e Macintosh and PC) will
contain "\r" characters.

* v1.4 - October 15, 1995

Added pod style documentation. Now you can see this manual page by doing
the following:

    pod2man CGI_Lite.pm | nroff -man | more

Also, modified the parse_form_data method so that it can return
the actual associative array (if called within an array context).

* v1.3 - October 12, 1995

Completely modified the parse_multipart_data method. It no longer
reads the multipart message line by line, but rather in small size
blocks (or "chunks"). This also eliminated a major bug that caused
Netscape to hang.

Since some browsers do not send a "\r\n" character string at the end
of header lines, the parse_multipart_data method conditionally checks
for and removes them. This also allows you to emulate a multipart/form-data
request by storing a sample request in a file and piping it to your program:

    cat multipart.txt | test.pl

* v1.2 - October 12, 1995

Added the set_file_type method to return filehandles for the stored
files.

* v1.1 - October 10, 1995

The environment variable CONTENT_TYPE is used to determine the type of
encoding scheme. In v1.0, the body of the POST request was parsed.

This module no longer outputs an error message if an invalid directory
is passed to the set_directory method. Instead, it returns a status
of 0 to indicate failure.

* v1.0 - September 26, 1995
