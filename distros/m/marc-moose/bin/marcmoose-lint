=head1 NAME

marcmoose-lint - Lint ISO2709 file against validation rules

=head1 VERSION

version 1.0.42

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Command line utility to I<lint> biblio records based on a validation rules file.
Biblio records file must be in ISO2709 format (UTF-8 only). Validation rules
file is in the format described in L<MARC::Moose::Lint::Checker>. At the end of
the process, handled by L<MARC::Moose::Lint::Processor>, 3 files are generated:
F<marc.iso.ok>, an ISO2709 file containing biblio records complying with
validation rules, F<marc.iso.bad>, an ISO2709 file which contains records
violating validation rules, and F<marc.iso.log> a text file containing a text
version of the biblio records that have failed the validation, followed by a
description of the violated rules.

B<TIP:> You can get quick statistics on errors frequency with this Perl
On-Liner: 

 perl -ne 'if (/^([0-9]{3})[()0-9]*: *(.*)$/) { print "$1: $2\n";}' marc.iso.log | sort | uniq -c
