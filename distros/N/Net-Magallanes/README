NAME

    Net::Magallanes - encapsulation of API calls to RIPE Atlas project.

SYNOPSIS

        use Net::Magallanes;
    
        my $atlas = new Net::Magallanes (
            KEY => '<YOUR_API_KEY>'
        );
    
        my $msm_id = $atlas->dns(
            name    =>  'www.vulcano.cl',
            type    =>  'A',
        );
    
        # Wait for RIPE Atlas to complete
        sleep(120);
    
        my @result = $atlas->answers($msm_id, 'A');
        print "Result is ", join ',', @result;

DESCRIPTION

    Net::Magallanes is a pure perl interface to the RIPE Atlas API, for
    requesting measurements and getting data from past measurements.

    More information on RIPE Atlas platform: atlas.ripe.net

    *WARNING*: This module is a "work in progress". By no means does it
    allow full API handling. Functionality will be added as needed. It is
    currently a minimal implementation, which works for the cases indicated
    in the documentation.

METHODS

 new

    Creates a new Net::Magallanes object. There're two optional parameters:

       KEY => '<Secret API Key for RIPE Atlas>'

    If you want to create new measurements, you must provide an API key for
    your RIPE Atlas account.

       INFILES => '<path/filename>[,<morefiles>]'

    If you want to use an existing JSON file with a previous measurement,
    instead of downloading one from Atlas API site. You can use more than
    one file, comma separated.

 answers(<MSM-id> [, { TYPE => <qtype>, TIMESTAMP => 1 }])

    Get an array of answers from the previous measurement with id MSM-id.
    The "answers" are the records from the ANSWER section of a DNS
    measurement.

    You can specify a qtype 'A' (default) or 'AAAA', and you'll get an
    array of addresses from the corresponding answer. With other types
    you'll get an array with a printable representation of each answer.

    If you ask for TIMESTAMP, then you'll have also the time when each
    measurement was done, as epoch seconds. The output will be an array of
    pairs (time, answer).

 nsids(<MSM-id>)

    Get an array of NSID texts from the results of a previous measurement
    MSM-id.

    If there's no NSID for a result, you'll get a 'NULL' string.

 rcodes((<MSM-id> [, { TIMESTAMP => 1 }])

    Get an array of RCODE texts from the results of a previous measurement
    MSM-id.

    If you ask for TIMESTAMP, then you'll have also the time when each
    measurement was done, as epoch seconds. The output will be an array of
    pairs (time, answer).

 dns( name => '<QNAME>' [, type => '<QTYPE>'] [, num_prb => '<NUM_PROBES'>
 ])

    Create a new "one-off" DNS measurement, asking for the name <QNAME>
    (required) and type <QTYPE> (AAAA default), from <NUM_PROBES> (default
    5) probes at random, with worldwide coverage.

    You must had initialized the Net::Magallanes object with a valid API
    key, with enough permissions and credits for measurement creation.

    Return the measurement id assignated by Atlas platform.

    You should take care for waiting enough time (5~6 minutes) before
    asking for the results of this measurement.

    The measurement uses sensible parameters like DO bit set, 1232 EDNS
    buffer size, recursive towards the probe resolver, etc.
