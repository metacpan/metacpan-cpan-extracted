  * Add timeout alarms to process() around send, recv and dispatch

    in the request

    also RPC::Serialized itself

    option, and some handler call naming magic
  * Add new Server using Net::Server in PreFork mode

  * Switched all usage of the YAML module with YAML::Syck

libyaml-rpc2-perl (0.04-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Really add dependency on libclass-accessor-perl.

libyaml-rpc2-perl (0.03-1) unstable; urgency=low
