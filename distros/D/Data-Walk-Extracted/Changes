0.024.004 2013-08-31 08:02:53 America/Los_Angeles

	Removed all of the overly tricky POD self references to mid paragraph points

0.024.002 2013-08-30 07:46:54 America/Los_Angeles

	Updated/tested all the POD links

	Brought all versions to the same level for Kwalitee

0.022.006 2013-08-28 08:38:17 America/Los_Angeles

	Updated Test::Pod to require v1.48 to see if that fixes some linux test fails
	Also removed a return prior to a | in one url to see if that helps

0.022.004 2013-08-27 20:31:58 America/Los_Angeles

	Escaped the # in the url links

0.020.004 2013-08-27 07:29:16 America/Los_Angeles

	Updated the Readme POD

0.022.002 2013-08-27 20:17:30 America/Los_Angeles

	Removed the requirement for use Moose::Role from the Types library
	Fixed a digit width that was causing perl on bsdunix to fail
	Fixed some POD that was causing some linux perl to fail

0.020.002 2013-08-27 07:18:43 America/Los_Angeles

	Final changes to the POD and prep for release to CPAN

0.020.001 2013-08-26 07:40:41 America/Los_Angeles

	Removed MooseX::ShortCut::BuildInstance again.
	added a 'to_string' attribute for Data::Walk::Print'
	Cleaned up some of the documentation

v0.019_007 2013-01-17 11:50:12 America/Los_Angeles

	Fixed the META files to include MooseX::ShortCut::BuildInstance for testing and Building requirements

v0.019_005 2013-01-13 21:51:49 America/Los_Angeles

	A minor change to the dist.ini file

v0.019_005 2013-01-13 21:48:27 America/Los_Angeles

	Major update of the POD's.

v0.019_003 2013-01-08 09:18:18 America/Los_Angeles

	Removed the dispatch table and type tables to their own modules

v0.017_001 2012-10-04 12:21:56 America/Los_Angeles

	Changed print_data to print out the scalar data pointer for skipped nodes instead of the word SKIPPED

	Move all the node skipping to Data::Walk::Extracted from the various roles and then added a skip flag to the $passed_ref for tracking by the roles.   This includes a rewrite of all skipping attributes with their callouts (breaks backwards compatibility!):

	Moved the dispatch method off to it's own role for portability.

	Changed the test suit to use MooseX::ShortCut::BuildInstance

	Rewrote the passed ref to track skip, primary_type, and secondary_type rather than testing for it each time. (also breaks backwards compatibility)

	changed the base state to SCALAR and UNDEF rather than going past SCALAR and UNDEF to END. (also breaks backwards compatibility)

v0.015_005 2012-08-29 12:05:41 America/Los_Angeles

	Removed the (bad) fixed primary call in Data::Walk:Clone - I don't remember how it got there.

v0.015_003 2012-08-28 17:22:53 America/Los_Angeles

	changed the _extracted_ref_type to use hash key lookups rather than if then statements.
	This isn't really a standard disptach table since the ref type hasn't been determined
	yet.

	Added multilayer support to one-shot attributes.  This allows the one shot attribute to stay
	in force for complete method call from a Role if the role makes a nested walking call to
	another Role.

	Another re-write of the guts of Data::Walk::Extracted to untangle the path of recursion.

	The re-write of Data::Walk::Extracted includes the addition of a "Zeroth" branch_ref element.

	The re-write of Data::Walk::Extracted prompted the addition of some dispatch tables to
	Data::Walk::Print.

	Added a DEFAULT failover to the dispatch method choices

	Added a Graft memory to Data::Walk::Graft

v0.013_001 2012-07-09 21:59:29 America/Los_Angeles

	added recognition of a 'name' key in the '_dispatch_method' for Data::Walk::Extracted (Meta data for dispatch methods)

	Fixed a failure to seed empty hash refs and array refs in the deep_clone method

v0.011_001 2012-07-09 14:14:53 America/Los_Angeles

	Changes includes additions to use this package in Log::Shiras

	Added a method for tracking actual subtractions
	in the prune_data method.  This includes a 'remember_prune_items' attribute
	and a 'get_pruned_positions' method.  See the POD for Data::Walk::Prune for
	more details.

	Added another role Data::Walk::Clone to allow for targeted cloning of data
	structures.

	moved the _dispatch_method to Data::Walk::Extracted so that dispatch tables by
	Role could be added without duplicating that code.

	Changed the graft_data function to clone the reference and allow for clone
	definition (Using Data::Walk::Clone)

	built in a 'Single shot settings' processor of attributes passed in the method call for
	the _process_the_data method in Data::Walk::Extracted.  This will allow for possible
	attribute calls in the method that will only affect that one pass of the method call.

	Added graft memory like the prune memory

	created the private method _build_branch in Data::Walk::Extracted to build the branch
	to the current branchref point if requested.   This is used by Data::Walk::Graft and
	Data::Walk::Prune

	Refactored Data::Walk::Extracted to use dispatch tables

	Improved the Data::Walk::Prune documentation and changed the prune memory attribute name

	Added the ability of the sort_XXX attributes to take sort CodeRefs ex. sub{ $b cmp $a }

v0.007_005 2012-05-17 08:24:20 America/Los_Angeles

	Updated the POD to be consistent.

	Switched testing from Test::And::Ouput to use Capture::Tiny.

v0.007_001 2012-04-19 08:46:23 America/Los_Angeles

	Reworked the guts to allow multiple Rolls to be added to the same base class .
	This is a major re-write to the ::Extracted class interface to support this but
	only a minor changes to the Role interfaces.  Among other changes the ::Extracted
	class does not add a default role anymore.  The ::Extracted class no longer has
	public method for processing data either.  Additionally the MooseX::StrictConstructor
	(Module/Pragma) was added to the class.

	Data::Walk::Graft is added to the package

	Testing for Data::Walk::Print is switched from Test::Output to Test::And::Output.

v0.05_07  2012-04-04 11:34:36 America/Los_Angeles

	Removed YAML from the test files since it was an
	unnessesary dependancy that caused test fails.

	Also updated some links in the POD and included
	Data::ModeMerge in the See Also section

v0.05_03  2012-04-03 13:54:29 America/Los_Angeles

	First Release to CPAN

v0.05_01  2012-03-21 20:03:17 America/Los_Angeles

	Adding functionality to support Data::Walk::Prune
