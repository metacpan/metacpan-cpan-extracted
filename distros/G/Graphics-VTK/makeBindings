=head1 NAME

Graphics::VTK  - A Perl interface to Visualization ToolKit

=head1 SYNOPSIS

C<use Graphics::VTK;>

=head1 DESCRIPTION


PerlVTK is an interface to the C++ visualization toolkit VTK 3.20.

It is designed to work similarly to the TCL bindings that come with the stock VTK 
package.

For installation instructions, see the README file.
You must have VTK installed before installing PerlVTK.
The homepage for VTK is http://www.kitware.com/.

To see how to use the module, check out the examples in the examples 
directory. 

All vtk objects in Perl must be created through the function new.
For example: 

  $renderer = Graphics::VTK::vtkRenderer->new;

To know exactly which functions are supported by this module, check the 
perldocs in L<Graphics::VTK::Common>, L<Graphics::VTK::Contrib>, L<Graphics::VTK::Graphics>,
L<Graphics::VTK::Imaging>.

Have fun!
