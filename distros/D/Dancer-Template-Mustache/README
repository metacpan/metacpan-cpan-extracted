NAME
    Dancer::Template::Mustache - Wrapper for the Mustache template system

VERSION
    version 0.3.0

SYNOPSIS
        # in config.yml
       template: mustache

       # in the app
       get '/style/:style' => sub {
           template 'style' => {
               style => param('style')
           };
       };

       # in views/style.mustache
       That's a nice, manly {{style}} mustache you have there!

DESCRIPTION
    This module is a Dancer wrapper for Template::Mustache.

    For now, the extension of the mustache templates must be ".mustache".

    Partials are supported, as are layouts. For layouts, the content of the
    inner template is sent via the usual *content* template variable. So a
    typical mustached layout would look like:

        <body>
        {{ content }}
        </body>
