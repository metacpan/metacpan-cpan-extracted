===============================

=head1 NAME

Date::Holidays::PT - Determine Portuguese public holidays

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Date::Holidays::PT;
  my ($year, $month, $day) = (localtime)[ 5, 4, 3 ];
  $year  += 1900;
  $month += 1;
  print "Woohoo" if is_pt_holiday( $year, $month, $day );

  my $h = pt_holidays($year);
  printf "Jan. 1st is named '%s'\n", $h->{'0101'};

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=head2 new

Creates a new Date::Holidays::PT object.

  my $mh = Date::Holidays::PT->new();

=head2 is_holiday

Should at least take three arguments:

year  (four digits)
month (between 1-12)
day   (between 1-31)

The return value from is_holiday is either a 1 or a 0 (1 if the
specified date is a holiday, 0 otherwise).

  if ( $mh->is_holiday( $year, $month, $day ) ) {
    # it's a holiday
  }

=head2 is_pt_holiday

Similar to is_holiday, but instead of returning 1 if the date is a
holiday returns a string comprising the name of the holidays. In the
event of two or more holidays on the same day (hey, it happens), the
string will comprise the name of all those holidays separated by a
semicolon.

  my $todays_holiday = $mh->is_pt_holiday( $year, $month, $day );
  if ( $todays_holiday ) {
    print "Today is $todays_holiday.\nDon't bother getting up!\n";
  }

=head2 holidays

Should take at least one argument:

year  (four digits)

Returns a reference to a hash, where the keys are date represented as
four digits, the two first representing month (01-12) and the last two
representing day (01-31).

The value for the key in question is the local name for the holiday
indicated by the day. In the event of two or more holidays on the same
day (yes, it happens!), the values will comprise the name of all those
holidays separated by a semicolon.

  my $years_holidays = holidays( $year );
  for (keys %$years_holidays) {
    my ($day, $month) = /(..)(..)/;
    print "$day/$month - $years_holidays->$_\n";
  }
