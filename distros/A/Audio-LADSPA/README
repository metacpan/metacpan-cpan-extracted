Audio::LADSPA
==============

This is a set of extensions to host LADSPA plugins,
you can query them, or apply them to audio data.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

Or, if you prefer the CPAN installer, type:

   perl -MCPAN -e'install Audio::LADSPA'

Which will fetch, make and install the module for you.

DEPENDENCIES

LADSPA dependencies:

 The tests specifically need the demo plugins from the
 ladspa_sdk package, with LADSPA_PATH pointing to the
 directory where they are installed.

 You do not have to set the LADSPA_PATH environment variable
 if your LADSPA plugins are located in either /usr/lib/ladspa
 or /usr/local/lib/ladspa, but you will be warned when the
 modules are loaded. You'll probably want to set it anyway,
 because most other LADSPA hosts need it.

 You can download the sdk from from http://www.ladspa.org/
 Debian users can use "apt-get install ladspa-sdk"

 Alternatively, you can skip the tests, but these modules
 are of no use without at least SOME plugins installed.

CPAN dependencies:

Also, this extension requires the following Perl modules;

  Test::More, Audio::Play, Scalar::Util, Data::Uniqid
  and Graph::Directed
   
Install them first from CPAN. Alternatively, if you're
installing using the CPAN or CPANPLUS shell, this can be taken
care of automatically.
