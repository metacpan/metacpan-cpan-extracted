NAME

    JSONY - Relaxed JSON with a little bit of YAML

VERSION

    This document describes JSONY version 0.1.20.

SYNOPSIS

        use JSONY;
    
        my $data = JSONY->new->load($jsony_string);

DESCRIPTION

    JSONY is a data language that is simlar to JSON, just more chill. All
    valid JSON is also valid JSONY (and represents the same thing when
    loaded), but JSONY lets you omit a lot of the syntax that makes JSON a
    pain to write.

API

    JSONY has one instance method: load. You pass it a JSONY string and it
    returns the loaded Perl data object.

JSONY SYNTAX

    Here is some examples of JSONY followed by equivalent JSON:

    Words don't need quotes. A list of things is an array:

        foo bar baz
    
        [ "foo", "bar", "baz" ]

    Strings with spaces can use single or double quotes:

        'foo bar'      # <= This is (a comment indicating) a string
        # More commenting
        "baz  boom "
    
        [ "foo bar ", "baz  boom " ]

    Top level hashes can be ':' separated pairs or use curlies. Sub hashes
    require curlies.

        foo: { bar baz }
        num: -1.2e3
    
        { "foo": { "bar": "baz" }, "num": -1.2e3 }

    Top level arrays can use '- ' at the start of lines. Those arrays go
    the end of line. Lines can be continued using a trailing comma. Sub
    arrays require square brackets.

        - array of 4 scalars
        - array with [ sub
          array { of
          things }]
        - array of 7 things on,
          two lines
    
        [
          [ "array", "of", 4, "scalars" ],
          [ "array", "with", [ "sub", "array", { "of": "things" } ] ],
          [ "array", "of", 7, "things", "on", "two", "lines" ]
        ]

    NOTE: You may want to look at the tests (especially t/load.t) to see
    the full abilities of JSONY.

STATUS

    JSONY has been in use for well over a year. It seems to working well.

    Development people are working on this in #jsony and #pegex in
    irc.freenode.net. Please drop by.

    JSONY.pm is a very simple Pegex-based parser. You can see the quite
    tiny JSONY grammar here:
