Revision history for Perl extension PPerl.

0.25
    - Fix exec code
    - Call srand so children aren't all the same random seed
    - Fix strange behaviour where perl can't see value in lexical $cycles
      after loop. Making $cycles a package var fixes this for some reason.

0.24
    - More tests (richardc)
    - Made exec() work (see t/19invoke_djbish.t if you're curious)

0.23
    - Locks around race points
    - More improvements to cleanup

0.22
    - Attempt to work around a race condition
    - Added support for turning off cleanup routines
    - Cleanup socket a little better on shutdown

0.21
    - Support maxclients setting on command line
    - Slightly improved debugging
    - chomp $version in pperl.h - multiline strings are a gcc
      extension and deprecated
    - Fixed dickvd bug (again)

0.20
    - Fix for the Dick Van Dyke bug
    
0.19
    - Rejig the generated code to fix a nasty closure bug

0.18
    - Made $$ changes work on perl 5.8
    - Set $0
    - Some bug fixes

0.17
    - Renamed pperl.c to main.c to allow building on case-insensitive file 
      systems (HFS+, samba)
    - pid propogation
    - Minor rework of the script slurping including moving __DATA__ and
      end blocks to the end. __END__ detection

0.16
    - Tests and fixes for: -T behaviour.  fork(), tied data, autoclose
      behavior, signal propogation, broken test 00stevens.t.
    - Cleanups for: argument passing.  Amount of stuff in PPerl.xs.
      Strict prototyping of subs.  Internal use of macros for speed.

0.15
    - Minor fixes
    
0.14
    - Switched entire model to pass fd's over the socket, rather than
      all of STDIN/STDOUT. This means we no longer have to do lots of
      messing with select() - it all just "works". Many beers to
      RichardC for this work.

0.13
    - Implement wide-open sockets (for people who need to run the same
      script as different users). Note this may have bad security "issues".
    - Turn off strict for actual script (script may turn it on again).
    - More help page stuff
