NAME
    XAO::DO::Web::Content -- Dynamic content management for XAO::Web

SYNOPSIS
     <%Content name="about_us"%>

DESCRIPTION
    Obsolete! Do not use in new development.

    For installation and usage instruction see "INSTALLATION AND USAGE"
    chapter below.

    Content object allows to embed editable content stored in a database
    into a web page or any other part of a system based on XAO::Web. There
    are virtually no limitations as to how content can be used.

    For instance the text on "News" page of the site might be a Content
    element. In that case site administrator would not need to modify any
    templates, but can edit, preview and publish news using web interface
    only.

    Another example could be storing complete product description template
    as a Content object. In that case modifying all product pages at once
    would be controlled by modifying just one template over the web in
    content editor.

    A content element is identified by a name that has the same set of
    restrictions as a XAO::FS ID - up to 30 characters, alpha-numeric and
    underscore characters only.

    Every bit of content has multiple values associated with it arranged by
    date of their modification. Most current version of content can be in
    one of two states - published and unpublished. If it is unpublished then
    it can only be seen if the special preview mode is turned on. That gives
    an ability to a site administrator to preview changes and probably make
    corrections before making these changes available for regular site
    visitors.

    A configuration for Content objects can be provided as a part of site
    configuration. Its URI is '/content' and parameters are:

     list_uri    => uri of content storage in the XAO FS, defaults
                    to '/Content'

     cache_time  => for how long to keep retrieved content in memory cache,
                    default is 5 minutes

     cache_size  => the size of memory cache in KB, default is 1024

     flag_cb_uri => location of a flag in clipboard that indicates whether
                    or not the preview mode is on

INSTALLATION AND USE
    The easiest way to install XAO Content is to use CPAN. Usually you would
    need to do something like this:

     sudo perl -MCPAN -e'install XAO::DO::Web::Content'

    If you downloaded archive and want to install it manually then usual
    four commands will do:

     perl Makefile.PL
     make
     make test
     sudo make install

    During execution of Makefile.PL you will be asked for a test database
    DSN, username and password. If you want to skip the tests enter 'none'
    for DSN or otherwise give it any disposable database DSN. In most cases
    OS:MySQL_DBI:test will do. Note: That database content will be
    completely destroyed after tests.

    Once installed the XAO Content is ready to be used. There are two
    scenarios to start using it -- if you already have a site where you want
    to add dynamic content functionality and if you do not have a site and
    want to just see XAO Content in action.

  TEST SITE TO SEE XAO CONTENT IN ACTION
    Here are the steps you need to follow to get a simple working site that
    uses XAO Content:

    1   Sym-link or recursively copy the 'sample' directory from the XAO
        Content distribution to your 'projects' directory in XAO
        installation path (usually /usr/local/xao/projects). The name you
        use for sym-linking is the name of your site --
        /usr/local/xao/projects/content would mean 'content' as the site
        name.

    2   Create an empty MySQL database for your site (providing MySQL
        username/password if required). Inour example we use 'content' as
        the database name.

         mysqladmin create content

    3   Create empty XAO::FS database on top of MySQL database:

         xao-fs --dsn=OS:MySQL_DBI:content init

    4   Go to /usr/local/xao/projects/content and run configure script:

         cd /usr/local/xao/projects/content
         perl ./configure.pl

        Enter OS:MySQL_DBI:content as the database DSN and username/password
        of a user that has full access to that database.

    5   Create database layout required by XAO Content:

         ./bin/build-structure

    6   Configure a virtual server in your Apache config:

         <VirtualHost SOME_HOST_NAME>
           ServerName SOME_HOST_NAME

           <Directory /usr/local/xao/handlers>
             Options ExecCGI
             SetHandler cgi-script
           </Directory>

           RewriteEngine on
           RewriteRule   ^/(.*)$  \
                         /usr/local/xao/handlers/xao-apache.pl/content/$1  \
                         [L]
         </VirtualHost>

        Here you replace SOME_HOST_NAME with a something that you have in
        your DNS or at least in /etc/hosts file. At the last line of
        RewriteRule the last part of the path is the site name that you used
        -- you need to change it if you used a different name.

    7   Done! Restart Apache and go to SOME_HOST_NAME in your browser to see
        how content management works.

  INTEGRATING XAO CONTENT INTO AN EXISTING SITE
    To integrate XAO Content into an existing site you shoul follow these
    steps (depending on your site setup not all of them might be
    applicable):

    1   Copy content*.html files from sample/templates/admin/ to your site's
        admin directory and modify them to your taste. In general you should
        make sure that an administrator is logged in before he/she has
        access to the content editor.

    2   Edit your Config.pm (or Config.pm.proto if you use prototypes) and
        add the following code to your build_structure() method:

         my $cobj=XAO::Objects->new(objname => 'Web::Content');
         $cobj->build_structure;

    3   Re-build your data structure using bin/build-structure script or any
        other tools that you use.

    4   Optionally copy files from sample/bits/content/*,
        sample/bits/hint-link and sample/hints/* to your site and modify
        them appropriately. The idea of these files is to show how you can
        customize default templates used by content editor and to provide
        useful "Hints" functionality.

    5   In your header file that you include in all you pages (if you have
        one) add a call to /bits/content/set-preview. That template displays
        nothing, but sets preview mode to support content editor.

    6   Look into various files in sample/templates for ideas and sample
        code.

METHODS
    Content is based in Web::Action object and such depends on 'mode'
    argument, with the default mode being 'show'.

    All methods if not stated otherwise support the following set of
    arguments that defines which content object to use:

     name       => Name of content
     data_id    => ID of a specific version (optional, rarely used)
     preview    => if non-zero then unpublished version of content will
                   be used. If that argument is not present then the
                   clipboard preview flag is used (see flag_cb_uri above)

    The following list of methods also shows 'mode' as the first element
    (order alphabetically).

    'content-add' => content_add (%)
        Displays a form for creating new content and when the form is filled
        -- creates that content accordingly.

        Arguments are:

         form.path      => path to form template
         success.path   => path to success template

    'content-data' => content_data (%)
        Displays data text by name according to preview argument or
        clipboard flag.

        By default it just outputs the content literally without any
        processing. If 'parse' argument is true then the content will be
        parsed as if it were a template. Arguments given to 'content-data'
        will be available to that template in this case.

        If there is a 'default.path' or 'default.template' arguments then
        they will be displayed in case where there is no content object by
        that name exists in the database. If default is not given and there
        is no content found in the database then an error will be thrown.

        Example:

         <%Content name="about_us"%>

         <%Content name="about_us" parse="1" REAL_NAME="John Silver"%>

         <%Content name="about_us"
                   parse="1"
                   default.path="/bits/default-about-us"
                   REAL_NAME="John Silver"
         %>

    'content-if-preview' => content_if_preview (%)
        Checks if preview mode is currently on and displays given 'path' or
        'template' if it is.

    'content-publish' => content_publish (%)
        Makes preview data block current for the given content. If there
        were no modifications to the content (no preview data block) then
        nothing is modified.

        Arguments are:

         name           => content name
         path/template  => what to display in case of success, optional

    'content_publish_all' => content_publish_all (%)
        Makes preview data blocks current for all content elements.

    'content-revert' => content_revert (%)
        Reverts given content to older date by creating or replacing preview
        data block with a copy of old content.

        Date does not have to match exactly, the data block with closest
        date equal to or preceeding the given date will be used. If as a
        result of that the current content is to be used anf there is no
        preview block defined then no modifications are made.

        If given content did not exist at all at the given time then no
        modifications are made as well.

        Arguments are:

         name       => content name
         time       => time to revert to

    'content_revert_all' => content_revert_all (%)
        Loads older date content for all content elements at once.

    'content-set-preview' => content_set_preview (%)
        Sets or drop preview flag in the clipboard indicating whether all
        subsequent calls to the Content should return current or preview
        content.

        Usually this is used somewhere in the page header on all pages to
        check for a specific cookie or a CGI parameter to turn on site
        'preview' mode.

        Example:

         <%Content
           mode="content-set-preview"
           value={<%Condition
                    a.cgiparam="preview_mode"
                    a.template="1"
                    b.cookie="preview_mode"
                    b.template="1"
                    default.template="0"
                  %>}
         %>

    'content-show' => content_show (%)
        Displays the content by a given name and optionally an ID of a
        specific release of that content.

        Passes the following parameters to the given template:

         COMMENT        => comment for data
         CURRENT_ID     => current published element ID
         DATA_ID        => ID of data block being used
         DESCRIPTION    => content description
         EFFECTIVE_TIME => publication effective time
         INSTRUCTION    => instruction
         MIME_TYPE      => content data MIME type
         MOD_TIME       => last modification time
         NAME           => content name
         PREVIEW_ID     => id of unpublished data or empty string if published
         PREVIEW_URL    => URL of a preview page
         TEXT           => content data

    'content-show-dates' => content_show_dates (%)
        Displays all publication dates in order from most recent to least
        recent. If 'name' parameter is given then dates are restricted to
        that specific element otherwise global list of dates is shown.

        Example:

         <SELECT NAME="xxx">
         <%Content mode="content-show-dates"
                   path="/bits/content-date-option"%>
         </SELECT>

    'content-store' => content_store (%)
        Stores new content by either replacing current content in the
        preview data block or by creating a new preview data block if there
        is no one currently.

        Arguments are:

         name           => content name
         comment        => comment for that release
         text           => full text for that release; stripped of whitespace
                           in the end and in the beginning
         mime_type      => MIME type, default is text/plain

INTERNAL METHODS
    The following methods are not available through 'mode' argument and
    serve various internal purposes.

    build_structure ()
        Builds supporting structure in the database. Does not destroy
        existing data -- safe to call on already populated database.

        Usually should be called in Config.pm's build_structure() method.

    cache ()
        Returns content cache reference.

    data_structure ()
        Returns a reference to a hash that describes database structure.
        Usually you would add it to your database description in Config.pm:

         my $cobj=XAO::Objects->new(objname => 'Web::Content');

         my %structure=(
             MyData => {
                 ...
             },

             %{$cobj->data_structure},

             MyOtherData => {
                 ...
             }
         );

        If that looks ugly (it is ugly) then look at build_structure()
        method description instead.

    get_content ($%)
        This method returns a Data::Content and Data::Content objects using
        standard content location definition arguments described in METHODS
        section preface. It is used in almost every other method to get the
        data of a content object.

        If called in scalar context then returns only content object,
        without data.

        Arguments it accepts are (as stated above):

         name       => Name of content (required)
         data_id    => ID of a specific version (optional, rarely used)
         preview    => if non-zero then unpublished version of content will
                       be used. If that argument is not present then the
                       clipboard preview flag is used (see flag_cb_uri above)
