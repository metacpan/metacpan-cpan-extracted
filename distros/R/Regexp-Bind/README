SYNOPSIS
         use Regexp::Bind qw(
                             bind global_bind
                             bind_array global_bind_array
                            );

         $record = bind($string, $regexp, @fields);
         @record = global_bind($string, $regexp, @fields);

         $record = bind_array($string, $regexp);
         @record = global_bind_array($string, $regexp);

DESCRIPTION
       This module is an extension to perl's native regexp func-
       tion. It binds anonymous hashes or named variables to
       matched buffers. Both normal regexp syntax and embedded
       regexp syntax are supported. You can view it as a tiny and
       petite data extraction system.
