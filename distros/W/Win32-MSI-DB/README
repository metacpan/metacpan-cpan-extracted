**** Changes ****

* since 1.05
	 Bug found and fixed by Peter Jaquiery (GRANDPA). Thank you!

* since 1.04
	Lots of cleanups by DBH. Thank you!

* since 1.03
	I've just discovered a bug in the perl package 'Win32::MSI::DB',
	you've submitted to CPAN. The bug, better to say the type off, is
	in the "_close" method. The handle is stored in the "$hdk", but
	MsiCloseHandle is called with non-existing $hdl.
Thanks to Martin (email protected)

* since 1.02
Field type "l" added (localized string), which ist used
in eg. File and Directory tables
