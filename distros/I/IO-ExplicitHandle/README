NAME

IO::ExplicitHandle - force I/O handles to be explicitly specified

DESCRIPTION

This module provides a lexically-scoped pragma that prohibits I/O
operations that use an implicit default I/O handle.  For example, "print
123" implicitly uses the "currently selected" I/O handle (controlled
by select).  Within the context of the pragma, I/O operations must
be explicitly told which handle they are to operate on.  For example,
"print STDOUT 123" explicitly uses the program's standard output stream.

The affected operations that use the "currently selected" I/O handle are
print, printf, say, close, write, and the magic variables $|, $^, $~, $=,
$-, and $%.  The affected operations that use the "last read" I/O handle
are eof, tell, and the magic variable $..  One form of the .. operator can
implicitly read $., but it cannot be reliably distinguished at compile
time from the more common list-generating form, so it is not affected
by this module.
