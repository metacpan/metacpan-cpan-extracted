0.04  Thu Dec 31 13:19:42 CET 2009
        - bugfixes due to package-name changes
0.05  Sat Feb 20 10:35:33 CET 2010
        - upgrading to libnfc-1.3.3 API 
          (some internal structures have been renamed)
        - lost support for older versions of the library
          (hopefully their api should be stable now)
0.06  Sat Feb 20 11:12:55 CET 2010
        - make it build properly where defines.h is not installed
0.07  Sat Feb 20 13:03:19 CET 2010
        - fixed a bug in 4K->write_sector() introduced when switching
          from unpack("C", $data) to split(//, $data)
0.08  Sun Feb 21 16:47:36 CET 2010
        - supporting the nfc_target_info_t union. Mifare specific structure is
          now accessed through the 'nai' member.
          ( the nfc_iso14443a_info_t  structure has been mapped in Libnfc.xs)
        - some minimal cleanings
0.09  Wed Mar 17 11:26:26 CET 2010
        - Extended support for mifare-classic tags (now supporting 4K, 1K and MINI)
0.10  Fri Jan 21 13:54:35 CET 2011
        - added support for libnfc-1.4 API (the library keeps changing its API)
0.11  Sat Jan 22 01:00:32 CET 2011
        - dropped support for libnfc API < 1.4
          (older versions of this module could be eventually used together with
          older versions of the libnfc library)
        - cleaner mapping of internal structures 
          (on the perl side it's not necessary anymore to care about retaining 
          the storage while references are being accessed)
0.12  Sun Jan 23 16:57:44 CET 2011
        - fixed some leaks (check : 470f526a767817eaf0357e1d067b836a7e0d1d33)
        - cleaned-up libnfc version checking logic in Makefile.PL
        - wrapping allocation/release operations with proper perl macros in the XS code
        - updated documentation
0.13 Mon Jan 24 01:23:59 CET 2011
        - fixed support for Mifare classic 1K and 4K (was broken since 0.11)
