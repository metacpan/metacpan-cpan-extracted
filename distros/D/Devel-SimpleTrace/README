NAME

    Devel::SimpleTrace - See where you code warns and dies using stack traces


DESCRIPTION

    This module can be used to more easily spot the place where a program or
    a module generates errors. Its use is extremely simple, you just need to
    load it.

    This is achieved by modifying the functions warn() and die() in order 
    to replace the standard messages by complete stack traces that precisely
    indicates how and where the error or warning occurred. Other than this, 
    their use should stay unchanged, even when using die() inside eval().


INSTALLATION

    To install this module, run the following commands:

        perl Makefile.PL
        make
        make test
        make install


    Alternatively, to install with Module::Build, you can use the 
    following commands:

        perl Build.PL
