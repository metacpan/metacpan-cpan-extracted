1.000001	2025-12-16

 - Fix default builder name to match documentation.

1.000000	2025-12-12

 - Various changes to Sub::Accessor::Small, mostly to generate more
   efficient code, especially delegations.

0.014	2022-06-16

 - Updated: Cope with changes to Sub::HandlesVia API; try to stick more to
   the public API.

0.013	2020-09-12

 [ Documentation ]
 - Sub::Accessor::Small is now documented, albeit only slightly.

 [ Other ]
 - Sub::Accessor::Small now passes defaults/builders to Sub::HandlesVia.
   This should allow delegated reset to work.

0.012	2020-02-14

 - Make Hash::FieldHash a recommendation rather than a requirement; fall
   back to Hash::Util::FieldHash on Perl 5.10+ and
   Hash::Util::FieldHash::Compat on Perl 5.8.

0.011	2020-02-14

 - Allow private attributes to have public accessor methods. (They could
   already have public methods delegated to them.)

0.010	2020-02-14

 [ Documentation ]
 - Document that you can use non-lexical methods for delegations. (This has
   already worked for at least five years.)

 [ Other ]
 - Added: Sub::HandlesVia support.

0.009	2017-06-13

 [ Bug Fixes ]
 - Fixes for defaults in accessors.
   Fixes RT#101024.

 [ Other ]
 - Updated: Support Sub::Util instead of Sub::Name (with Sub::Name as a
   fallback).

0.008	2014-03-29

 [ Bug Fixes ]
 - Fix attribute defaults.

0.007	2014-03-29

 - Much cleaned up Sub::Accessor::Small.

0.006	2014-03-29

 - Split out the most reusable parts of Lexical::Accessor into
   Sub::Accessor::Small.

0.005	2014-03-28

 - Make Lexical::Accessor more even subclassable.

0.004	2014-03-28

 - Make Lexical::Accessor more subclassable.

0.003	2013-12-15

 - If Sub::Name is available, use it to name the exported `lexical_has`
   keyword.

0.002	2013-10-22

 [ Bug Fixes ]
 - Fix is=>'lazy'.

 [ Documentation ]
 - Bundle a benchmarking script as an example.
 - Comparisons with MooseX::Privacy, MooX::PrivateAttributes, etc.
 - Fix minor (yet confusing) typo.

 [ Other ]
 - Default to is=>'rw' instead of is=>'bare'.
 - Use Hash::FieldHash (it's significantly faster) instead of
   Hash::Util::FieldHash::Compat.
