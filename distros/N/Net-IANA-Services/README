DESCRIPTION

    Working with named services can be a pain when you want to go back and
    forth between the port and its real name. This module helps alleviate
    some of those pain points by defining some helping hashes, functions,
    and regular expressions.

CONSTANTS

 $IANA_REGEX_PORTS

    Regular expression to match any port, irregardless of which protocol it
    goes over.

    While this is a highly optimized regex, you should consider using the
    hashes or subroutines instead as they are much better. This is merely
    for your convenience.

    Case is ignored and the protocol must match on a word boundary!

  Examples

        # Matches
        $port =~ $IANA_REGEX_PORTS;
    
        # Won't match
        $non_port =~ $IANA_REGEX_PORTS;

 $IANA_REGEX_SERVICES

    Regular expression to match any service, irregardless of which protocol
    it goes over.

    While this is a highly optimized regex, you should consider using the
    hashes or subroutines instead as they are much better. This is merely
    for your convenience.

    Case is ignored and the protocol must match on a word boundary!

  Examples

        # Matches
        $service =~ $IANA_REGEX_SERVICES;
    
        # Won't match
        $non_service =~ $IANA_REGEX_SERVICES;

 $IANA_REGEX_PORTS_DCCP

    Regular expression to match any port that is known to work over dccp.

    While this is a highly optimized regex, you should consider using the
    hashes or subroutines instead as they are much better. This is merely
    for your convenience.

    Case is ignored and the protocol must match on a word boundary!

  Examples

        # Matches
        $port_dccp =~ $IANA_REGEX_PORTS_DCCP;
    
        # Won't match
        $non_port_dccp =~ $IANA_REGEX_PORTS_DCCP;

 $IANA_REGEX_PORTS_SCTP

    Regular expression to match any port that is known to work over sctp.

    While this is a highly optimized regex, you should consider using the
    hashes or subroutines instead as they are much better. This is merely
    for your convenience.

    Case is ignored and the protocol must match on a word boundary!

  Examples

        # Matches
        $port_sctp =~ $IANA_REGEX_PORTS_SCTP;
    
        # Won't match
        $non_port_sctp =~ $IANA_REGEX_PORTS_SCTP;

 $IANA_REGEX_PORTS_TCP

    Regular expression to match any port that is known to work over tcp.

    While this is a highly optimized regex, you should consider using the
    hashes or subroutines instead as they are much better. This is merely
    for your convenience.

    Case is ignored and the protocol must match on a word boundary!

  Examples

        # Matches
        $port_tcp =~ $IANA_REGEX_PORTS_TCP;
    
        # Won't match
        $non_port_tcp =~ $IANA_REGEX_PORTS_TCP;

 $IANA_REGEX_PORTS_UDP

    Regular expression to match any port that is known to work over udp.

    While this is a highly optimized regex, you should consider using the
    hashes or subroutines instead as they are much better. This is merely
    for your convenience.

    Case is ignored and the protocol must match on a word boundary!

  Examples

        # Matches
        $port_udp =~ $IANA_REGEX_PORTS_UDP;
    
        # Won't match
        $non_port_udp =~ $IANA_REGEX_PORTS_UDP;

 $IANA_REGEX_SERVICES_DCCP

    Regular expression to match any service that is known to work over
    dccp.

    While this is a highly optimized regex, you should consider using the
    hashes or subroutines instead as they are much better. This is merely
    for your convenience.

    Case is ignored and the protocol must match on a word boundary!

  Examples

        # Matches
        $service_dccp =~ $IANA_REGEX_SERVICES_DCCP;

 $IANA_REGEX_SERVICES_TCP

    Regular expression to match any service that is known to work over tcp.

    While this is a highly optimized regex, you should consider using the
    hashes or subroutines instead as they are much better. This is merely
    for your convenience.

        $ssh_tcp_info = $IANA_HASH_INFO_FOR_SERVICE->{ ssh }{ tcp };
    
        Dumper $ssh_tcp_info;
        #   22 => {
        #      desc => 'The Secure Shell (SSH) Protocol'
        #      name => 'ssh'
        #      note => 'Defined TXT keys: u=<username> p=<password>'
        #   }
    
    
        #  Get info for http over any protocol
        $http_info = $IANA_HASH_INFO_FOR_SERVICE->{ http };
    
        Dumper $http_info;
        #   sctp => {
        #       '80' => {
        #           desc => 'HTTP',

        #       },
        #   },
        #   udp => {
        #       '80' => {
        #           desc => 'World Wide Web HTTP',
        #           name => 'http',

        #   },

 $IANA_HASH_SERVICES_FOR_PORT

    This lists all of the services for the given port, irregardless of the
    protocol.

    An empty list will be returned if nothing is found. This respects
    wantarray>

        Dumper $port_22;
        # [qw/ ssh /]
    
        my $port_tcp_1110 = $IANA_HASH_SERVICES_FOR_PORT_PROTO->{ 1110 }{ tcp };
        Dumper $port_tcp_1110;
        # [qw/ webadmstart /]
    
        my $port_udp_1110 = $IANA_HASH_SERVICES_FOR_PORT_PROTO->{ 1110 }{ udp };
        Dumper $port_udp_1110;
        # [qw/ nfsd-keepalive /]

 $IANA_HASH_PORTS_FOR_SERVICE

    This lists all of the ports for the given service, irregardless of the
    protocol.

  Example

        my $service_http_alt = $IANA_HASH_PORTS_FOR_SERVICE->{ 'http-alt' };
        Dumper $service_http_alt;
        # [qw/ 591  8008  8080 /];

METHODS

 iana_has_port

    Helper function to check if the given port (and optional protocol) is
    defined by IANA.

    If only the port is given, then it will be checked across all protocols
    while restricting the search to just the provided protocol if one is
    given.

  Arguments

      1. Port

	* Required

	* Port (int)

	* Port you want looked up

      2. Protocol

	* Optional

	* String

	* Limit the search to only this protocol if specified

  Returns

      1. Search results

	* Boolean

	* 1 if the match was found, 0 otherwise

  Examples

        iana_has_port( 22 );    # 1
        iana_has_port( 34221 ); # 0
    
        iana_has_port( 271, 'tcp' );  # 1
        iana_has_port( 271, 'udp' );  # 0

 iana_has_service

    Helper function to check if the given service (and optional protocol)
    is defined by IANA.

    If only the service name is given, then it will be checked across all
    protocols while restricting the search to just the provided protocol if
    one is given.

  Arguments

      1. Service Name

	* Required

	* String

	* Service name you want looked up

      2. Protocol

	* Optional

	* String

	* Limit the search to only this protocol if specified

  Returns

      1. Search results

	* Boolean

	* 1 if the match was found, 0 otherwise

  Examples

        iana_has_service( 'ssh' );    # 1
        iana_has_service( 'not-ss' ); # 0
    
        iana_has_service( 'xmpp-server', 'tcp' );  # 1
        iana_has_service( 'xmpp-server', 'udp' );  # 0

 iana_info_for_port

    Helper function to get the known services for the given port and
    optional protocol, as defined by IANA.

    If only the port is given, then you will get back an array ref
    containing all of the services that are defined by IANA. If a protocol
    is specified, then the returned prtocols will be limited to those
    running over that type.

  Arguments

      1. Port

	* Required

	* Port (int)

	* Port you want looked up

      2. Protocol

	* Optional

	* String

	* Limit the search to only this protocol if specified

  Returns

      1. Search results

	* Array

	* The list of protocols running over the specified info (arrayref
	if in scalar context)

	* Undefined if the searched was unsuccessful!

  Examples

        iana_info_for_port( 22 );    # [qw/ ssh /]
        iana_info_for_port( 34221 ); # undef
    
        iana_info_for_port( 271, 'tcp' );  # [qw/ pt-tls /]
        iana_info_for_port( 271, 'udp' );  # undef

 iana_info_for_service

    Helper function to get the known information for the given service and
    optional protocol, as defined by IANA.

    If only the service is given, then you will get back a hash ref
    containing the normal return information hash for each defined protocol
    for that service.

  Arguments

      1. Service Name

	* Required

	* String

	* Service name you want looked up

      2. Protocol

	* Optional

	* String

	* Limit the search to only this protocol if specified

  Returns

      1. Service information (for a provided protocol)

	* Hash

	* Undefined if the searched was unsuccessful!

      The returned hash contains the following pieces of information (keys
      are lower case):

      Name

	The full name (with proper capitalization) for the requested
	service

      Desc

	A short synopsis of the service, usually a sentence or two long

      Note

	Any additional information they wanted to provided that users
	should be aware of

  Examples

        iana_info_for_service( 'xribs' );  # { udp => { 2025 => { desc => '', name => 'xribs', note => '' } } }
        iana_info_for_service( 'not-ss' ); # undef
    
        iana_info_for_service( 'xribs', 'tcp' );  # undef
        iana_info_for_service( 'xribs', 'udp' );  # { 2025 => { desc => '', name => 'xribs', note => '' } }
