IF YOU HAVE PROBLEMS:
    This module is maintained and supported on a mailing list,

    maxdb@lists.mysql.com

    Please send comments and bug-reports to this list. Please
    include the output of perl -v [-V], the version of the MaxDB
    database, the version of the MaxDB SQLDBC-SDK, the version of
    DBI, and details about your platform in your bug report.

    Mailing list archives are available at:

HOW TO GET THE LATEST VERSION:
    Use the following URL to look for new versions of this module:

    the section on "/search.cpan.org/~maxdb" in the http: manpage

PREREQUISITES
    Before installing the driver make sure that you have the
    following prerequisites available.

    Perl
        Build, test and install Perl 5 (at least 5.6.1). It is very
        important to TEST it and INSTALL it!

    DBI Build, test and install DBI (at least 1.21). Since DBD::MaxDB is
        a DBI driver, you need DBI. It is available at:

        the section on "/search.cpan.org" in the http: manpage

    C compiler
        A C compiler is required, since currently you can only
        install from source. Maybe a binary version will be
        available in future releases.

        Make sure, that the C compiler you use is the same C
        compiler that was used for compiling Perl! Otherwise you
        will almost definitely encounter problems because of
        differences in the underlying C runtime libraries.

    MaxDB SQLDBC-SDK
        The DBD::MaxDB driver needs to link with MaxDB's common
        database interface SQLDBC which is not included in this
        distribution. You need at least the version 7.5.00.12. But
        you should use a newer version of SQLDBC from release
        7.6.00. For details about SQLDBC see:

        the section on
        "/www.mysql.com/products/maxdb/pdf/sqldbc_eng.pdf" in the
        http: manpage

        You can download the SQLDBC software development kit from
        the MySQL homepage at:

        the section on "/www.mysql.com/maxdb" in the http: manpage

            There are different ways to install the SQLDBC software
            development kit.

    Install using SDBINST
            You need to download and unpack the MaxDB standard
            installation package (maxdb-all-<os>-[32 or 64]bit-
            <arch>-<version>_<build>.<tgz>)

            Go to the directory into which you unpacked the
            installation package. Enter the following commands:

              ./SDBINST -package Base
              ./SDBINST -package "Database Connectivity"

            The Base package is required for SQLDBC SDK. If you have
            already installed it, you can skip the first command.

    Install from tarball
            Download the latest version of the SQLDBC SDK from the
            MySQL homepage or the ftp server. Choose the SQLDBC
            package that matches your operating system architecture.

            Unpack the tarball to a local directory of your choice
            with the following command:

             tar xvzf maxdb-all-<os>-32|64bit-<arch>-<version>_<build>

    MaxDB database server
        Of course you will need a MaxDB database instance. The
        DBD::MaxDB driver supports all available versions of MaxDB
        (SAP DB) at least 7.3. The MaxDB software and documentation
        can be found at:

        the section on "/www.mysql.com/maxdb" in the http: manpage

INSTALLATION
    By default Makefile.PL uses the MaxDB global configuration file
    (/etc/opt/sdb) on Unix/Linux platforms or the registry (requires
    Win32API::Registry) on Windows platforms for retrieving the
    location of `SQLDBC-SDK'.

    If the location of `SQLDBC-SDK' cannot be found or if you want
    to control it yourself, define the environment variables
    `SQLDBCSDK' or set the option `< -o <path' >> when calling `
    perl Makefile.PL '

    Since the tests will connect to a live database, you need to set
    the following environment variables for the tests to run:

      DBI_DSN=dbi:MaxDB:<host>/<dbname>
      DBI_USER=<username>
      DBI_PASS=<password>
      
    E.g. Definition of the parameter url for a connection to the database TST on 
    the computer REMOTESERVER C< dbi:MaxDB:REMOTESERVER/TST >

    Now you are ready, to make and install DBD::MaxDB. The final
    steps are:

      1.   perl Makefile.PL
      2.   make              (or nmake, if VC++ on windows)
      3.   make test         (or nmake, if VC++ on windows)
      4.   make install      (or nmake, if VC++ on windows)

    Note that you should execute steps 1 to 3 as a normal user, not
    as root!

TESTING
    You need to set the following environment variables for the
    tests to run:

      DBI_DSN=dbi:MaxDB:<host>/<dbname>
      DBI_USER=<username>
      DBI_PASS=<password>

    Execute the command:

    `make test' or `make test TEST_VERBOSE=1'

    to run the test suite. Running the test suite should not show
    any errors.

    Since DBD::MaxDB uses the shared library `libSQLDBC_C.so'
    (`libSQLDBC_C.dll' on windows), you have to ensure that this
    library can be found by the operating system. On windows you
    should add the `libSQLDBC_C.dll' to you `PATH' environment
    variable. On Unix/Linux you will normally add the path of
    `libSQLDBC_C.[so|sl]' to the environment variable
    `LD_LIBRARY_PATH'.
