DESCRIPTION
    This module is designed as a drop in mod_perl2 replacement for the
    mod_dir and mod_index modules. It uses user configurable XSLT
    stylesheets to generate the directory listings.

    THIS CODE IS INCOMPLETE -- THIS IS A DEVELOPMENT RELEASE!

CONFIGURATION
    This module attempts to emulate as much as the functionality from the
    Apache mod_dir and mod_index modules as possible. Some of this is
    performed directly by the Apache::AutoIndex::XSLT module itself, and
    some through a combination of the *options* elements presented in the
    output XML and the XSLT stylesheet. As a result, some of these
    configuration directives will do little or nothing at all if the XSLT
    stylesheet used does not use them.

  FileTypesFilename

  AddAlt
         AddAlt "PDF file" *.pdf
         AddAlt Compressed *.gz *.zip *.Z

    *AddAlt* provides the alternate text to display for a file, instead of
    an icon. File is a file extension, partial filename, wild-card
    expression or full filename for files to describe. If String contains
    any whitespace, you have to enclose it in quotes (" or '). This
    alternate text is displayed if the client is image-incapable, has image
    loading disabled, or fails to retrieve the icon.

  AddAltByEncoding
         AddAltByEncoding gzip x-gzip

    *AddAltByEncoding* provides the alternate text to display for a file,
    instead of an icon. MIME-encoding is a valid content-encoding, such as
    x-compress. If String contains any whitespace, you have to enclose it in
    quotes (" or '). This alternate text is displayed if the client is
    image-incapable, has image loading disabled, or fails to retrieve the
    icon.

  AddAltByType
         AddAltByType 'plain text' text/plain

    *AddAltByType* sets the alternate text to display for a file, instead of
    an icon. MIME-type is a valid content-type, such as text/html. If String
    contains any whitespace, you have to enclose it in quotes (" or '). This
    alternate text is displayed if the client is image-incapable, has image
    loading disabled, or fails to retrieve the icon.

  AddDescription
         AddDescription "The planet Mars" /web/pics/mars.png

    This sets the description to display for a file. File is a file
    extension, partial filename, wild-card expression or full filename for
    files to describe. String is enclosed in double quotes (").

  AddIcon
         AddIcon (IMG,/icons/image.xbm) .gif .jpg .xbm
         AddIcon /icons/dir.xbm ^^DIRECTORY^^
         AddIcon /icons/backup.xbm *~

    This sets the icon to display next to a file ending in name. Icon is
    either a (%-escaped) relative URL to the icon, or of the format
    (alttext,url) where alttext is the text tag given for an icon for
    non-graphical browsers.

    Name is either ^^DIRECTORY^^ for directories, ^^BLANKICON^^ for blank
    lines (to format the list correctly), a file extension, a wildcard
    expression, a partial filename or a complete filename.

    *AddIconByType* should be used in preference to *AddIcon*, when
    possible.

  AddIconByEncoding
         AddIconByEncoding /icons/compress.xbm x-compress

    This sets the icon to display next to files. Icon is either a
    (%-escaped) relative URL to the icon, or of the format (alttext,url)
    where alttext is the text tag given for an icon for non-graphical
    browsers.

    MIME-encoding is a wildcard expression matching required the
    content-encoding.

  AddIconByType
         AddIconByType (IMG,/icons/image.xbm) image/*

    This sets the icon to display next to files of type MIME-type. Icon is
    either a (%-escaped) relative URL to the icon, or of the format
    (alttext,url) where alttext is the text tag given for an icon for
    non-graphical browsers.

    MIME-type is a wildcard expression matching required the mime types.

  DefaultIcon
         DefaultIcon /icons/__unknown.png

    The *DefaultIcon* directive sets the icon to display for files when no
    specific icon is known. Url-path is a (%-escaped) relative URL to the
    icon.

  HeaderName
  IndexIgnore
         IndexIgnore README .htindex *.bak *~

    The *IndexIgnore* directive adds to the list of files to hide when
    listing a directory. File is a shell-style wildcard expression or full
    filename. Multiple *IndexIgnore* directives add to the list, rather than
    the replacing the list of ignored files. By default, the list contains .
    (the current directory).

  IndexOptions
         IndexOptions +DescriptionWidth=* +FancyIndexing +FoldersFirst +HTMLTable
         IndexOptions +IconsAreLinks +IconHeight=16 +IconWidth=16 +IgnoreCase
         IndexOptions +IgnoreClient +NameWidth=* +ScanHTMLTitles +ShowForbidden
         IndexOptions +SuppressColumnSorting +SuppressDescription
         IndexOptions +SuppressHTMLPreamble +SuppressIcon +SuppressLastModified
         IndexOptions +SuppressRules +SuppressSize +TrackModified +VersionSort
         IndexOptions +XHTML

    The *IndexOptions* directive specifies the behavior of the directory
    indexing.

    See
    <http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/mod_autoindex.html#indexoptions>.

  IndexOrderDefault
         IndexOrderDefault Ascending Name

    The *IndexOrderDefault* directive is used in combination with the
    *FancyIndexing* index option. By default, fancyindexed directory
    listings are displayed in ascending order by filename; the
    *IndexOrderDefault* allows you to change this initial display order.

    *IndexOrderDefault* takes two arguments. The first must be either
    Ascending or Descending, indicating the direction of the sort. The
    second argument must be one of the keywords Name, Date, Size, or
    Description, and identifies the primary key. The secondary key is always
    the ascending filename.

    You can force a directory listing to only be displayed in a particular
    order by combining this directive with the *SuppressColumnSorting* index
    option; this will prevent the client from requesting the directory
    listing in a different order.

  IndexStyleSheet
         IndexStyleSheet "/css/style.css" 

    The *IndexStyleSheet* directive sets the name of the file that will be
    used as the CSS for the index listing.

  ReadmeName
         ReadmeName FOOTER.html

    The *ReadmeName* directive sets the name of the file that will be
    appended to the end of the index listing. Filename is the name of the
    file to include, and is taken to be relative to the location being
    indexed. If Filename begins with a slash, it will be taken to be
    relative to the *DocumentRoot*.

  DirectoryIndex
         DirectoryIndex index.html index.shtml

    The *DirectoryIndex* directive sets the list of resources to look for,
    when the client requests an index of the directory by specifying a / at
    the end of the directory name. Local-url is the (%-encoded) URL of a
    document on the server relative to the requested directory; it is
    usually the name of a file in the directory. Several URLs may be given,
    in which case the server will return the first one that it finds. If
    none of the resources exist and the *Indexes* option is set, the server
    will generate its own listing of the directory.

  DirectorySlash
         DirectorySlash On

    The *DirectorySlash* directive determines, whether or not to fixup URLs
    pointing to a directory or not. With this enabled (which is the
    default), if a user requests a resource without a trailing slash, which
    points to a directory, the user will be redirected to the same resource,
    but with trailing slash.

XSLT STYLESHEET
    The XSLT stylesheet will default to *index.xslt* in the DocumentRoot of
    the website. This can be changed using the *IndexStyleSheet* directive.

    An example *index.xslt* file is bundled with this module in the
    *examples/* directory.
