MooseX-NotRequired

This module allows you to create anonymous sub classes of Moose classes with all the
required flags on the attributes turned off.

    package ObjectA;

    use Moose;

    has required => (is => 'ro', isa => 'Str', required => 1);
    has optional => (is => 'ro', isa => 'Int' );
    has semi_required => (is => 'ro', isa => 'Str' );

    1;

    ...

    use MooseX::NotRequired;

    my $new_class = MooseX::NotRequired::make_optional_subclass('ObjectA');
    my $obj = $new_class->new(); # no blow up
    my $default = $new_class->new({ semi_required => undef }); # fine too
    ...
    my $second = ObjectA->new(); # blow up because required isn't filled in.
    my $third = ObjectA->new({ required => 'a', semi_required => undef }); 
    # blow up because semi_required must be a string.
