=head1 NAME

blocksync - CLI command

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.002


=cut

=head1 SYNOPSIS

BlockSync can some of the same stuff that bigsync (by Egor Egorov) can
- it's just written in perl.

BlockSync copies data from source file to destination file (can be a block
device) and calculates checksum on each block it copies.
On all runs after the first only the changed blocks will be copied.

    blocksync -S -s /source/path -d /destination/path
