NAME
    List::MapMulti - map through multiple arrays at once

SYNOPSIS
     use feature qw/say/;
     use List::MapMulti qw/mapm/;
 
     my @numbers = (2..10, qw/Jack Queen King Ace/);
     my @suits   = qw/Clubs Diamonds Hearts Spades/;
     my @cards   = mapm { "$_[0] of $_[1]" } \@numbers, \@suits;
 
     say scalar(@cards);     # says '52'
     say $cards[0];          # says '2 of Clubs'
     say $cards[1];          # says '2 of Diamonds'
     say $cards[-1];         # says 'Ace of Spades'

DESCRIPTION
    List::MapMulti provides shortcuts for looping through several lists in a
    nested fashion. Think about all the times you've needed to do something
    like:

     foreach my $x (@exes) {
       foreach my $y (@whys) {
         # do something with $x and $y
       }
     }

    There are two different solutions available to you: `map_multi` (which has
    an alias `mapm`) and `iterator_multi`.

    The only thing this module exports by default is `mapm`.

  `map_multi { BLOCK } \@list1, \@list2 ...`
    (Or `mapm`!)

    Calls the codeblock with every possible combination of values from each
    list. If you imagine it as calling within a set of nested loops, then the
    final list is the innermost loop; and the first loop is the outermost
    loop.

    Note that within the codeblock, the items from each list are available as
    $_[0], $_[1], etc. The $_ variable is set to a List::MapMulti::Iterator
    object which is used internally by `map_multi`.

    For the special (but common) case where you're just mapping over two
    lists, $a and $b are aliased to $_[0] and $_[1]. You may need to do `our
    ($a, $b)` to suppress warnings about variables being used only once.

    `mapm` is exported by default, but `map_multi` needs to be requested
    explicitly.

  `iterator_multi(\@list1, \@list2, ...)`
    This allows constructions like this:

     my $iterator = iterator_multi(\@numbers, \@suits);
     while (my ($number, $suit) = $iterator->())
     {
       say "$number of $suit";
     }

    Although `map_multi` is arguably a nicer syntax, the iterator provides you
    with an important advantage: you don't have to iterate through every
    possible combination. You can control flow using, say, `next`, `last` or
    `redo`.

  List::MapMulti::Iterator
    This is advanced fu that you probably don't need to know about.

    While iterators act like coderefs (you get the next set of values via
    `$iterator->()`), internally they are blessed objects that overload `&{}`.
    As they are objects, they are able to provide some methods.

    These are the methods they provide:

   `new(\@list1, \@list2, ...)`
    Constructor. The `iterator_multi` function is just a shortcut for this.

   `next`
    Calling `$iterator->next` is exactly equivalent to calling
    `$iterator->()`.

   `current`
    Returns the same thing as the previous call to `next` (unless the original
    arrays have changed since then).

    This can also be used as a setter, in which case it writes back to the
    appropriate slots in the original arrays.

   `next_indices`
    Returns the array indices that will be used to read from the original
    arrays next time `next` is called. Again, this can be used as a setter.

   `current_indices`
    Returns the array indices that was used to read from the original arrays
    last time `next` was called.
