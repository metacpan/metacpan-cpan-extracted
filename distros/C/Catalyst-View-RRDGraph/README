NAME
    Catalyst::View::RRDGraph - RRD Graph View Class

SYNOPSIS
    use the helper to create your View myapp_create.pl view RRDGraph
    RRDGraph

    from the controller:

      sub routine :Local {
        my ($self, $c) = @_;

        $c->stash->{'graph'} = [
                "--lower-limit", "0",
                "--start", "end-1d",
                "--vertical-label", "My Label",
                "--height", 600,
                "--width", 300,
                "DEF:Data=/path/to/rrd.rrd:data:AVERAGE",
                "AREA:Data#0000FF:Data "
        ];
        $c->forward('MyApp::View::RRDGraph');
      }

DESCRIPTION
    This view generates RRD graph images from the graph defintion placed in
    the stash. The controller is responsable of placing an ARRAYREF in
    $c-stash->{'graph'}> with the same data as to generate a graph with the
    RRDs module, except for *filename*, that will be automatically generated
    by the view.

    It doesn't depend on RRDs, but *does* need it to work (and for the tests
    to pass). You can install RRDs, for instance, using Alien::RRDtool, or
    compiling it manually from <http://oss.oetiker.ch/rrdtool/>

CONFIGURATION
    Configurations for the view are:

  IMG_DIR
    Directory to generate temporary image files. Defaults to /tmp/

  IMG_FORMAT
    Image format for the generated files. 'PNG' by default.

  ON_ERROR_SERVE
    On error, if this config value is set, the file to which it points will
    be served (so you can serve an "error image" file to the user).
    Alternately, it can be set to a code reference, that will called with
    $self, $c and $error. You can then generate your own content in this
    handler. Default (leaving undefined) is to throw an expception.

    See <http://oss.oetiker.ch/rrdtool/doc/rrdgraph.en.html> for more info.

METHODS
  new
    Constructor.

  process
    Called internally by Catalyst when the view is used.
