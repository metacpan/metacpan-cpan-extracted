        Class::MOP::Attribute interface
        - added test for this

    - update Class::MOP dependency
    - hide the Moose::Meta::Attribute::Custom::* package

    * MooseX::AttributeHelpers::Base
      - changing this to use the new Class::MOP::Attribute
        reader and write method ref stuff.
      - fixed this to use find_or_create_type_constraint
        instead of trying to parse stuff on our own.

    * MooseX::AttributeHelpers::Collection
      - this is pretty much empty subclass now cause of
        the find_or_create_type_constraint fix above

        process_options_or_provides(), which gives us more
        flexibility when writing additional helpers
      - removed check for 'provides' and 'isa' attr
        options before _process_options. It should be
        called always.
