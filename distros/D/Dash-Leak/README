NAME
    Dash::Leak - Track memory allocation

SYNOPSIS
    Quick summary of what the module does.

        BEGIN {
            # enables operation of Dash::Leak, leaksz is a nop without this
            $ENV{DEBUG_MEM} = 1;
        }

        use Dash::Leak;
    
        {
            leaksz "block label";
            # some code, that may leak
        }
        # If your code leaked, you'll be noticed about change
        # of process vsize after leaving block
    
        leaksz "tests begin";
        some_operation($arg);
        leaksz "some_operation", sub {
            warn sprintf "We leaked after some_operation($arg) by %+d kilobytes;", shift
        };
        another_operation();
        leaksz "another_operation";
        # ...

        use Dash::Leak sub { ... }; # Will call this cb for every alloc, instead of warn

EXPORT
    Export of this module is "virtual", by using Devel::Declare. When
    $ENV{DEBUG_MEM} is true, it will work, when false, this opcodes will be
    ignored, like with "leaksz ... if 0";

FUNCTIONS
  leaksz $label, [$cb->($delta)]
    Starts tracking current block. If something changed since last note,
    notice will be warned. If callback is passed, it will be invoked instead
    of warn.
