    [Fixed]

0.002     2019-04-25 09:44:47+01:00 Europe/London

    [Fixed]

    - Fixed `set()` not working with Yancy::Command::backend::copy. The
      `set()` method now can create new files with the given ID, and
      should probably be preferred to `create()` (which does not require
      an ID, but uses the `path` attribute).
