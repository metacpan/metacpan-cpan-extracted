0.04	11 July 2002
        Upgraded test-suite to make it ready for Perl core inclusion (if that
        ever happens).  Added check for PerlIO and EBCDIC also, by courtesy of
	Jarkko Hietaniemi.

	Updated MANIFEST: test.md5 was missing, so I was the only one in the
	world where the tests worked.

	Rearranged top of source to not need fully qualified VERSION anymore.

        Checked for defined() problems: none found.

0.03	10 July 2002
