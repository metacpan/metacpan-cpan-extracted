Revision history for URL::Normalize

0.43    2021-08-23
        - Added missing documentation/Changes information. This is what happens
          when it's years between each CPAN release. :(

0.42    2021-08-23

0.41    2021-08-23
        - Fixed wrong release date in previous release.

0.40    2021-08-23
        - Added more default directory index regular epxressions.
        - Removed handling of social query parameters; it was always too
          specific/limited, and shouldn't be in a module like this one.
        - Minor fixes/improvements to the documentation.

0.39    2018-06-12
        - Remove unneeded test script, which should fix some failing tests.

0.38    2018-05-30
        - Canonicalise URLs when creating the object. Handles some issues that
          URI::Normalize solved better than this module.

0.37    2018-05-30
        - Rewrote 'remove_dot_segments' to handle fragments better. This fixes
          issue #3. Improved tests accordingly. (thanks cyga)
        - Added dzil [MetaJSON]. (thanks manwar)
        - Upped versions on dependencies.

0.36    2017-12-27
        - Added 'remove_query_parameter' and 'remove_empty_query_parameters'.
        - Deprecated 'get_url'; 'url' should be used instead.
        - Upped dependencies' version requirements.
        - Improved tests.
        - Improved documentation.

0.35    2016-07-07
        - Corrected the version number in the documentation.

0.34    2016-07-07
        - MAJOR: Directory indexes are NO LONGER case-sensitive, so 'Index.html'
                 and 'index.html' are treated the same.
        - Added more directory indexes to the default directory index list.
        - Added more UTM-parameters to the default social query parameter list.
        - Renamed 'add_directory_index_regexp' to 'add_dir_index_regexp'.
        - Up requirements' versions.
        - Improved the documentation.

0.33    2015-12-12
        - Maintenance release:
            - Upped version numbers on required modules.
            - Changed license to MIT.
            - Updated dist.ini.

0.32    2015-10-29
        - ADDED: add_directory_index_regexp() can be used to add directory
          index regexps.
        - ADDED: add_social_query_param() can be used to add social query
          params.
        - Added a few tests.
        - Improved the documentation.

0.31    2015-10-28
        - Improved the documentation.

0.30    2015-10-28
        - MAJOR UPDATE: Lots of changes under the hood, but most of the
          functionality should behave as before, with exceptions mentioned
          below.
        - Improved the tests.
        - Improved the documentation, although the API hasn't changed that
          much.
        - CHANGED: The constructor now only accepts a URL, _or_ a path of
          a URL. This makes it possible to do normalizing on just the paths
          as well, but the 'base' argument might come back in the future.
        - REMOVED: remove_hostname_prefix() is no longer considered to be
          the job of this module. Instead, look into Domain::PublicSuffix
          for getting the "real" domain name from a URL.
        - REMOVED: do_all() because it's considered too harmful.

0.22    2015-09-09
        - Added correct 'remove_social_query_parameters' call from 'do_all'.

0.21    2015-03-02
        - When removing dot segments, '/.../' will now be treated as '/./'.

        - Improved support for older Perl versions.

0.17    2014-05-31
        - remove_fragment does NOT remove the fragment (#whatever) if they
          are part of the "logical" path, ie. "http://www.ex.com/#foo/bar"
          will NOT be changed, but "http://www.ex.com/#foo" will be translated
          to "http://www.ex.com/".
          Added tests for it.
        - remove_fragments was added, which behaves like the old
          remove_fragment, and removes anything after a # in the URL.
          Added tests for it.
        - Rewrote the remove_dot_segments method totally, and it no longer
          relies on the RFC 3986 algorithm, but something simpler or better,
          depending on how one chooses to look at it. (jamaica)
          Added tests for it.
        - Improved the documentation.

0.11    2012-12-13
