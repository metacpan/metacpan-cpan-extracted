NAME
    App::Goto - Utility for accessing remote servers via SSH

SYNOPSIS
      use App::Goto;

      my $goto = App::Goto->({ config => $config, args => $args });

      system( $goto->cmd );

    Via included 'g2' script, allows for shortening of commands for
    connecting to remote servers. Examples of the type of command that can
    be shortened by using g2 are:

        g2 l log        => ssh 127.0.0.1 -t 'cd /var/log/ && bash'
        g2 f top        => ssh firstserver -t 'htop'

    See g2's own documentation for further details.

DESCRIPTION
    App::Goto is designed to make it as easy as possible to access remote
    servers via SSH, allowing you to give the shortest possible unique
    string needed to identify the server, and optionally to specify what
    command to run upon login - such as changing to a frequently-used
    directory for you.

    Requires a hashref of config details that define hosts & commands; and
    an arrayref of arguments to define the specific host & command to use.

METHODS
  is_success
    Boolean, returns true if the passed-in arguments were correctly parsed.
    Otherwise false.

  error
    If is_success is false, this should give a useful reason why.

  cmd
    Returns the command string calculated based on the passed-in args &
    config

  nick
    Returns the calculated nickname from the possibly-ambiguous supplied
    argument.

  host
    Returns the actual hostname for the supplied nickname.
