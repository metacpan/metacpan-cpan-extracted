NAME
    Parse::Apache::ServerStatus - Simple module to parse apache's
    server-status.

SYNOPSIS
        use Parse::Apache::ServerStatus;

        my $url = 'http://localhost/server-status';
        # or http://localhost/server-status?auto

        my $prs = Parse::Apache::ServerStatus->new(
           url     => 'http://localhost/server-status',
           timeout => 30
        );

        my $stat = $prs->get or die $prs->errstr;

        # or

        my $prs = Parse::Apache::ServerStatus->new;

        foreach my $url (@urls) {
            $prs->request(url => $url, timeout => 30) or die $prs->errstr;
            my $stat = $prs->parse or die $prs->errstr;
        }

        # or both in one step

        foreach my $url (@urls) {
            my $stat = $prs->get(url => $url, timeout => 30)
                or die $prs->errstr;
        }

DESCRIPTION
    This module parses the content of apache's server-status and countes the
    current status by each process. It works nicely with apache versions 1.3
    and 2.x.

METHODS
  new()
    Call "new()" to create a new Parse::Apache::ServerStatus object.

  request()
    This method requests the url and safes the content into the object.

  parse()
    Call "parse()" to parse the server status. This method returns a hash
    reference with the parsed content. There are diffenrent keys that
    contains the following counts:

        p    Parents (this key will be kicked in future releases, dont use it)
        r    Requests currenty being processed
        i    Idle workers
        _    Waiting for Connection
        S    Starting up
        R    Reading Request
        W    Sending Reply
        K    Keepalive (read)
        D    DNS Lookup
        C    Closing connection
        L    Logging
        G    Gracefully finishing
        I    Idle cleanup of worker
        .    Open slot with no current process

        The following keys are set to 0 if extended server-status is not activated.

        ta   Total accesses
        tt   Total traffic
        rs   Requests per second
        bs   Bytes per second
        br   Bytes per request

    It's possible to call "parse()" with the content as argument.

        my $stat = $prs->parse($content);

    If no argument is passed then "parse()" looks into the object for the
    content that is stored by "request()".

  get()
    "get()" calls "request()" and "parse()" in one step. It's possible to
    set the options "url" and "timeout" and it returns the hash reference
    that is returned by "parse()".

  content()
    Call "content()" if you need the full content of server-status.

        my $content = $prs->content;

  errstr()
    "errstr()" contains the error string if the requests fails.

  ua()
    Access the "LWP::UserAgent" object if you want to set your own
    properties.

OPTIONS
    There are only two options: "url" and "timeout".

    Set "url" with the complete url like "http://localhost/server-status".
    There is only http supported by default, not https or other protocols.

    Set "timeout" to define the time in seconds to abort the request if
    there is no response. The default is set to 180 seconds if the options
    isn't set.

EXAMPLE
        use strict;
        use warnings;
        use Parse::Apache::ServerStatus;
        
    $|++;
        my $prs = Parse::Apache::ServerStatus->new(
            url => 'http://localhost/server-status',
            # url => 'http://localhost/server-status?auto',
            timeout => 10
        );
        
    my @order    = qw/p r i _ S R W K D C L G I . ta tt rs bs br/;
        my $interval = 10;
        my $header   = 20;
        
    while ( 1 ) {
            print map { sprintf("%8s", $_) } @order;
            print "\n";
            for (my $i = 0; $i <= $header; $i++) {
                my $stat = $prs->get or die $prs->errstr;
                print map { sprintf("%8s", $stat->{$_}) } @order;
                print "\n";
                sleep($interval);
            }
        }

EXAMPLE CONFIGURATION FOR APACHE
    This is just an example to activate the handler server-status for
    localhost.

        ExtendedStatus On
        <Location /server-status>
            SetHandler server-status
            Order Deny,Allow
            Deny from all
