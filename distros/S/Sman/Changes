      - Use IPC::Run::run()

1.03   Wed May 28 2008
      - 'cat %F | gunzip -f --stdout | man -c' method removed
          to get ascii from manpages; (it caused warnings on Centos 4
          when autoconfiguring under cron)
      - Look in /usr/local/lib/swish-e/perl and /usr/libexec/swish-e/perl/
            for SWISH::DefaultHighlight. Latter is where rpms put it.
      - Better error outputs if we can't locate swish-e or load SWISH::API.
      - No known machines use 'cat %F | gunzip -f --stdout | man -c' 
          to get ascii from manpages; method removed (it caused warnings on Centos4)
      - Added to and changed the TODO file

          version of Swish-e installed supports it)
      - add /sw/bin to PATH we set in sman-update
          version of Swish-e installed supports it).
