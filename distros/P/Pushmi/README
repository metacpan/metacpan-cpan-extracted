NAME
    Pushmi - Subversion repository replication tool

SYNOPSIS
      pushmi mirror /var/db/my-local-mirror http://master.repository/svn
      pushmi sync /var/db/my-local-mirror

DESCRIPTION
    Pushmi provides a mechanism for bidirectionally synchronizing Subversion
    repositories. The main difference between Pushmi and other replication
    tools is that Pushmi makes the "slave" repositories writable by normal
    Subversion clients.

CONFIGURATION
    Install and run memcached
        We use memcached for better atomic locking for mirrors, as the
        subversion revision properties used for locking in SVK is
        insufficient in terms of atomicity.

        You need to start memcached on the "authproxy_port" port specified
        in pushmi.conf. For exmaple:

          memcached -p 7123 -dP /var/run/memcached.pid

    Set up your local repository
        Create /etc/pushmi.conf and setup username and password. See
        t/pushmi.conf for example.

          pushmi mirror /var/db/my-local-mirror http://master.repository/svn

    Bring the mirror up-to-date.
          pushmi sync --nowait /var/db/my-local-mirror

        Configure a cron job to run this command every 5 minutes.

    Configure your local svn
        Set up your svn server to serve /var/db/my-local-mirror at
        "http://slave.repository/svn"

    For your existing Subversion checkouts, you may now switch to the slave
    using this command:

      svn switch --relocate http://master.repository/svn http://slave.repository/svn

    From there, you can use normal "svn" commands to work with your
    checkout.

    Setup auto-verify
    You can optionally enable auto-verify after every commit by setting
    revision property "pushmi:auto-verify" on revision 0 for the repository,
    Which can also be done with:

      pushmi verify --enable /path/to/repository

    You will also need to specify the full path of verify-mirror utility in
    the "verify_mirror" configuration option.

    When the repository is in inconsistent state, users will be advised to
    switch back to the master repository when trying to commit. The
    inconsistent state is denoted by the "pushmi:inconsistent" revision
    property on revision 0, and can be cleared with:

      pushmi verify --correct /path/to/repository

AUTHENTICATION
    The above section describes the minimum setup without authentication and
    authorisation.

    For svn:// access
        You can we svn:// access for Pushmi, but there are some limitations
        for it as of the current implementation. First of all it will have
        to be using the shared credential when committing to the master. So
        you will need to make sure the user is allowed to write to the
        master. And as a side-effect, the commits via the slave will be
        committed by the shared user on the master. You can however use some
        post-commit hook or other means to set the "svn:author" revision
        property afterwards. You will need to make sure "use_shared_commit"
        is enabled, and if you are using svn+ssh://, make sure the user
        pushmi runs as has the correct ssh key to commit to the master.

    For authz_svn-controlled master repository
        You need to use an external mechanism to replicate the authz file
        and add a "AuthzSVNAccessFile" directive in the slave's slave
        "httpd.conf", along with whatever authentication modules and
        configurations. You will need additional directives in "httpd.conf"
        using mod_perl2:

          # replace with your auth settings
          AuthName "Subversion repository for projectX"
          AuthType Basic
          Require valid-user
          # here are the additional config required for pushmi
          PerlSetVar PushmiConfig /etc/pushmi.conf
          PerlAuthenHandler Pushmi::Apache::AuthCache

    For public-read master repository
        You can defer the auth* to the master on write. Put the additional
        config in "httpd.conf":

          PerlSetVar SVNPath /var/db/my-local-mirror
          PerlSetVar Pushmi /usr/local/bin/pushmi
          PerlSetVar PushmiConfig /etc/pushmi.conf

          PerlLoadModule Apache::AuthenHook # for apache 2.2

          <LimitExcept GET PROPFIND OPTIONS REPORT>
            AuthName "Subversion repository for projectX"
            AuthType Basic
            Require valid-user
            # for apache 2.0
            PerlAuthenHandler Pushmi::Apache::AuthCommit
            # for apache 2.2
            AuthBasicProvider Pushmi::Apache::RelayProvider
          </LimitExcept>

CONFIG FILE
    "pushmi" looks for /etc/pushmi.conf or wherever "PUSHMI_CONFIG" in
    environment points to. Available options are:

    username
        The credential to use for mirroring.

    password
        The credential to use for mirroring.

    authproxy_port
        The port memcached is running on.

    use_cached_auth
        If pushmi should use the cached subversion authentication info.

    use_shared_commit
        Use the "username" and "password" for committing to master.

    verify_mirror
        Path to verify-mirror.

    Some mirror-related options are configurable in svk, in your
    ~/.subversion/config's "[svk]" section:

    ra-pipeline-delta-threshold
        The size in bytes that pipelined sync should leave the textdelta in
        a tempfile. Default is 2m.

    ra-pipeline-buffer
        The max number of revisions that pipelined sync should keep in
        memory when it is still busy writing to local repository.

LOGGING
    "pushmi" uses Log::Log4perl as logging facility. Create
    /etc/pushmi-log.conf. See t/pushmi-log.t as exmaple. See also
    Log::Log4perl::Config for complete reference.
