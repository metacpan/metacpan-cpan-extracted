NAME
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::UploadToDarkPAN - Release to a private CPAN (a.k.a
    a DarkPAN)

VERSION
    version 2.0.0

SYNOPSIS
    In your dist.ini

      [UploadToDarkPAN]
      username    = example
      password    = changeme
      darkpan_uri = https://cpan-mirror.local/upload

DESCRIPTION
    This plugin allows the "release" command to upload your distribution to
    a private CPAN (a.k.a a DarkPAN).

    It extends Dist::Zilla::Plugin::UploadToCPAN to replace the "upload_uri"
    value with a configurable "darkpan_uri" value.

    This plugin looks for configuration in "dist.ini", "~/.dzil/config.ini",
    "~/.pause".

    If the "darkpan_uri" config value is not provided, you will be prompted
    to provide it during the "BeforeRelease" phase.
