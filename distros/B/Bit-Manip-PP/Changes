Revision history for Bit-Manip-PP

1.07    2017-07-24
        - added bit_tog() as an alias to bit_toggle()
        - changed lsb >= msb in _check_lsb(), we now allow equal which can be
          used to select an individual bit
        - added tests for the reference feature

1.06    2017-03-28
        - no functional or doc changes
        - missed doing an s/x/y/g for the Appveyor update in 1.05

1.05    2017-03-28
        - no functional or documentation changes
        - implemented integration with Appveyor CI (Windows testing)

1.04    2017-02-10
        - bit_set(), bit_clr(), bit_toggle(), bit_on() and bit_off() can now all
          accept the $data parameter as a value, or a reference to the scalar.
          If passed-by-value, we still return the modified data to keep
          consistent with previous functionality. If passed-by-reference, we'll
          modify $data directly by reference, and return 0 upon success
        - added _ref() and tests for it. This is used for allowing scalar refs
          to be sent in, in place of a scalar for $data
        - added Travis CI and Coveralls integration, added tests to reach 100%
          coverage
        - correct an erroneous include of Bit::Manip in t/45-bit_clr.t

1.03    2017-02-10
        - instead of importing "import" from Exporter, we now just use it as a
          base class. This fixes CPAN Testers failures on 5.6.2
        - we now require a minimum of 7.10 of ExtUtils::MakeMaker for the same
          reason as above
        - fixed incorrect statement in POD (closes #2)

1.02    2017-02-09
        - added bit_clr(), clears a set of bits
        - removed erroneous call to 'defined' (part of #2)
        - performance enhancement (change grep() to a check with tr//)
          (closes #2) (thanks to Larry Leszcynski for pointing out both issues)

1.01    2017-01-27
        - removed erroneous "use feature 'say';" from t/40, as it was causing
          CPAN Testers to fail on < v5.10.x

1.00    2017-01-25
        - fixed issue in bit_set() that leading zeroes in a binary string
          weren't populating properly

0.01    2017-01-25
        - First version, released on an unsuspecting world
        - ported bit_count()
        - ported bit_mask()
        - bit_bin() ported
        - ported __check_lsb(), __check_msb(), __check_value()
        - ported bit_get()
        - ported bit_set()
        - ported bit_toggle()
        - ported bit_on()
        - ported bit_off()
