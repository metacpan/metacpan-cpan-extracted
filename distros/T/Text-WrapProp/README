Text-WrapProp version 0.05
==========================

Text::WrapProp - proportional line wrapping to form simple paragraphs

Text::WrapProp::wrap_prop() is a very simple paragraph formatter for proportional
text. It formats a single paragraph at a time by breaking lines at word boundaries.
You must supply the column width in floating point units which should be set to
the full width of your output device. A reference to a character width table
must also be supplied. The width units can be any metric you choose, as long as
the column width and the width table use the same metric.

Proportional wrapping is most commonly used in the publishing industry.
