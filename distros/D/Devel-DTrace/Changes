0.10    2008-07-22
        Complete rewrite of runops loop. Perl's scope exit mechanism is
        now used to report subroutine returns. I think it might actually
        be valid now rather than working more or less by accident as it
        did previously.

0.11    2008-07-22
        Improved stack walk that finds sub name so that it crosses
        stack chunk boundaries. It's unclear whether this ever happens
        in practice given that we call it on the first OP after
        subroutine entry.
