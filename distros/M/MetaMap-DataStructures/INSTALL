MetaMap-DataStructures
    This package provides a container for the information extracted from
    machine readable MetaMap mapped text.

TESTING PLATFORMS
    MetaMap-DataStructures has been developed and tested on Linux primarily
    using Perl and the Bash shell.

REQUIREMENTS
    MetaMap-DataStructures REQUIRES that the following software be
    installed. More details on how to obtain and install appear below.

    --Programming Languages Perl (version 5.8.5 or better)

    --CPAN modules <MODULE NAME>

PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES
  Perl (version 5.8.5 or better)
    Perl is freely available at:

    <http://www.perl.org>

    It is very likely that you will already have Perl installed if you are
    using a Unix/Linux based system.

INSTALLATION
    If you have supervisor access, or have configured MCPAN for local
    install, you can install via:

     perl -MCPAN -e shell
     > install MetaMap-DataStructures

    If not, you can, "manually" install by downloading the *.tar.gz file,
    unpacking, and executing the following commands.

                    perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/home/programs LIB=/home/lib
                    make
                    make test
                    make install

    Note that the PREFIX and LIB settings are just examples to help you
    create a local install, if you do not have supervisor (su) access.

    You must include /home/lib in your PERL5LIB environment variable to
    access this module when running.

    If you have the super-user access, then you can install
    MetaMap-DataStructures into system directories via : perl Makefile.PL
    make make install make clean

    The exact location of where MetaMap-DataStructures will be installed
    depends on your system configuration. A message will be printed out
    after 'make install' telling your exactly where it was installed.
