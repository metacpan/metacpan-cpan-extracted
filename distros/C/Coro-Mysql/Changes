Revision history for Perl extension Coro::Mysql

1.27 Tue Jun  3 15:38:29 CEST 2014
	- grrr, remove dbeugging code again.

1.26 Tue Jun  3 15:37:40 CEST 2014
	- fix a use-after-free corruption bug when closing database
          handles.

1.25 Tue Jun  3 05:17:12 CEST 2014
	- mariadb 5.5 isn't actually binary-compatible to mysql 5.5,
          work around that.
	- remove debugging code (sigh).

1.24 Tue Jun  3 05:08:07 CEST 2014
	- port to mariadb 5.5 (and probably anything < 10), by treating it
          like mysql with missing library symbols.

1.23 Tue May  6 15:03:55 CEST 2014
	- work around mariadb 10.0.10 no longer exporting vio functions by skipping
          most of the safety checks - library mismatches will now cause memory
          corruption causing crashes on the first sql statement execution.
	- use correct header errno.h, not sys/errno.h.

1.22 Fri Aug  2 06:06:14 CEST 2013
	- experimental support for mariadb 10 (which has quite big changes).
	- work around incompatible changes (again) in 5.16. use feature my ass.
          (patch by....)

1.21 Thu Oct 11 05:21:10 CEST 2012
	- no functional changes.
	- document the fact that the API used by this module is now public,
          so it doesn't rely on library internals anymore.
	- verified to work with mysql connector/C 6.0.2 (compatible to
          5.5).

1.2  Thu Jul 26 23:19:47 CEST 2012
        - ensure DBD::mysql and Coro::Mysql are linked against the same
          libmysqlclient version (required is same libmysqlclient, but no
          idea how to check for that).
        - explicitly support libmysqlclient 5.1 and 5.5 - 5.1 probably just
          worked before on most (but not all) architectures.

1.1   Sun Feb 20 11:34:38 CET 2011
	- implement a special EV mode, used when EV was available at build
          time AND is used by AnyEvent, otherwise fall back to Coro::Handle.
	- perl 5.10 or 5.12 breaks the syntax used in the with_db. fixed.

1.02  Wed Sep  1 18:37:48 CEST 2010
	- use xgptr everywhere, so it actually works on those newer
          systems.

1.01  Tue Aug 31 16:40:16 CEST 2010
	- gptr typedef is missing from newer libmysql, as
          pointed out by Yury Zavarin.

1.0   Sun Jun 21 02:56:05 CEST 2009
	- allow unblock calls on non-mysql handles as well
          (and return them unchanged).
        - unpatching was done too late durign destruction -
          hook diretcly into mysql's vio for that. saves memory
          and should be faster, even though neither will make a big
          difference :)
        - added a nice usage example using PApp::SQL 1.04.

0.1   Sat May 30 08:57:43 CEST 2009
	- first cpan upload.

0.01  Sun May 17 15:11:00 CEST 2009
	- original version; cloned from Convert::Scalar.
