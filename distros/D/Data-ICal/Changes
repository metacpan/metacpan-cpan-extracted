Revision history for Data-ICal

0.23 2019-08-14

 - Rewrite property folding to be faster (and clearer)(thanks to Calvin Morrison)
 - Linewrap tests: add a stronger assertion about expectation(thanks to Ricardo Signes)

Note that as the folding code is rewritten, there is a tiny behavior change:
Long folded strings will always contain CRLF at the end no matter if
original strings have that or not(they should have according to RFC).
Please report if this is an issue to you.
