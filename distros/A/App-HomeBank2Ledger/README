DESCRIPTION

    homebank2ledger converts HomeBank <http://homebank.free.fr/> files to a
    format usable by Ledger <https://www.ledger-cli.org/>. It can also
    convert directly to the similar Beancount <http://furius.ca/beancount/>
    format.

    This software is EXPERIMENTAL, in early development. Its interface may
    change without notice.

    I wrote homebank2ledger because I have been maintaining my own personal
    finances using HomeBank (which is awesome) and I wanted to investigate
    using plain text accounting programs. It works well enough for my data,
    but you may be using HomeBank features that I don't so there may be
    cases this doesn't handle well or at all. Feel free to file a bug
    report. This script does NOT try to modify the original HomeBank files
    it converts from, so there won't be any crazy data loss bugs... but no
    warranty.

 Features

      * Converts HomeBank accounts and categories into a typical set of
      double-entry accounts.

      * Retains HomeBank metadata, including payees and tags.

      * Offers some customization of the output ledger, like account
      renaming.

    This program is feature-complete in my opinion (well, almost -- see
    "CAVEATS"), but if there is anything you think it could do to be even
    better, feedback is welcome; just file a bug report. Or fork the code
    and have fun!

 Use cases

    You can migrate the data you have in HomeBank so you can start
    maintaining your accounts in Ledger (or Beancount).

    Or if you don't plan to switch completely off of HomeBank, you can
    continue to maintain your accounts in HomeBank and use this script to
    also take advantage of the reports Ledger offers.

INSTALL

    There are several ways to install homebank2ledger to your system.

 using cpanm

    You can install homebank2ledger using cpanm. If you have a local perl
    (plenv, perlbrew, etc.), you can just do:

        cpanm App::Homebank2Ledger

    to install the homebank2ledger executable and its dependencies. The
    executable will be installed to your perl's bin path, like
    ~/perl5/perlbrew/bin/homebank2ledger.

    If you're installing to your system perl, you can do:

        cpanm --sudo App::Homebank2Ledger

    to install the homebank2ledger executable to a system directory, like
    /usr/local/bin/homebank2ledger (depending on your perl).

 Downloading just the executable

    You may also choose to download homebank2ledger as a single executable,
    like this:

        curl -OL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chazmcgarvey/homebank2ledger/solo/homebank2ledger
        chmod +x homebank2ledger

 For developers

    If you're a developer and want to hack on the source, clone the
    repository and pull the dependencies:

        git clone https://github.com/chazmcgarvey/homebank2ledger.git
        cd homebank2ledger
        make bootstrap      # installs dependencies; requires cpanm

OPTIONS

 --version

    Print the version and exit.

    Alias: -V

 --help

    Print help/usage info and exit.

    Alias: -h, -?

 --manual

    Print the full manual and exit.

    Alias: --man

 --input FILEPATH

    Specify the path to the HomeBank file to read (must already exist).

    Alias: --file, -i

 --output FILEPATH

    Specify the path to the Ledger file to write (may not exist yet). If
    not provided, the formatted ledger will be printed on STDOUT.

    Alias: -o

 --format STR

    Specify the output file format. If provided, must be one of:

      * ledger

      * beancount

 --account-width NUM

    Specify the number of characters to reserve for the account column in
    transactions. Adjusting this can provide prettier formatting of the
    output.

    Defaults to 40.

 --accounts

    Enables account declarations.

    Defaults to enabled; use --no-accounts to disable.

 --payees

    Enables payee declarations.

    Defaults to enabled; use --no-payees to disable.

 --tags

    Enables tag declarations.

    Defaults to enabled; use --no-tags to disable.

 --commodities

    Enables commodity declarations.

    Defaults to enabled; use --no-commodities to disable.

 --budget

    Enables budget transactions.

    Budget transactions are only supported by the Ledger format (for now).
    This option is silently ignored otherwise.

    Defaults to enabled; use --no-budget to disable.

 --opening-date DATE

    Specify the opening date for the "opening balances" transaction. This
    transaction is created (if needed) to support HomeBank's ability to
    configure accounts with opening balances.

    Date must be in the form "YYYY-MM-DD". Defaults to the date of the
    first transaction.

 --rename-account STR

    Specifies a mapping for renaming accounts in the output. By default
    homebank2ledger tries to come up with sensible account names (based on
    your HomeBank accounts and categories) that fit into five root
    accounts:

      * Assets

      * Liabilities

      * Equity

      * Income

      * Expenses

    The value of the argument must be of the form "REGEXP=REPLACEMENT". See
    "EXAMPLES".

    Can be repeated to rename multiple accounts.

 --exclude-account STR

    Specifies an account that will not be included in the output. All
    transactions related to this account will be skipped.

    Can be repeated to exclude multiple accounts.

EXAMPLES

 Basic usage

        # Convert homebank.xhb to a Ledger-compatible file:
        homebank2ledger path/to/homebank.xhb -o ledger.dat
    
        # Run the Ledger balance report:
        ledger -f ledger.dat balance

    You can also combine this into one command:

        homebank2ledger path/to/homebank.xhb | ledger -f - balance

 Account renaming

    With the "--rename-account STR" argument, you have some control over
    the resulting account structure. This may be useful in cases where the
    organization imposed (or encouraged) by HomeBank doesn't necessarily
    line up with an ideal double-entry structure.

        homebank2ledger path/to/homebank.xhb -o ledger.dat \
            --rename-account '^Assets:Credit Union Savings$=Assets:Bank:Credit Union:Savings' \
            --rename-account '^Assets:Credit Union Checking$=Assets:Bank:Credit Union:Checking'

    Multiple accounts can be renamed at the same time because the first
    part of the mapping is a regular expression. The above example could be
    written like this:

        homebank2ledger path/to/homebank.xhb -o ledger.dat \
            --rename-account '^Assets:Credit Union =Assets:Bank:Credit Union:'

    You can also merge accounts by simple renaming multiple accounts to the
    same name:

        homebank2ledger path/to/homebank.xhb -o ledger.dat \
            --rename-account '^Liabilities:Chase VISA$=Liabilities:All Credit Cards' \
            --rename-account '^Liabilities:Amex$=Liabilities:All Credit Cards'

    If you need to do anything more complicated, of course you can edit the
    output after converting; it's just plain text.

 Beancount

        # Convert homebank.xhb to a Beancount-compatible file:
        homebank2ledger path/to/homebank.xhb -f beancount -o ledger.beancount
    
        # Run the balances report:
        bean-report ledger.beancount balances

CAVEATS

      * I didn't intend to make this a releasable robust product, so it's
      lacking tests.

      * Scheduled transactions are not (yet) converted.

      * There are some minor formatting tweaks I will make (e.g.
      consolidate transaction tags and payees)
