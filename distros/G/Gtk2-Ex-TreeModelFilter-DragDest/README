Gtk2-Ex-TreeModelFilter-DragDest adds the TreeDragDest interface to
GtkTreeModelFilter objects.  As of Gtk 2.12 a filtered model is a drag
source, but not a drag destination.  With DragDest you can drag and
drop to re-order rows in a TreeView.

The code here takes two forms,

  * A TreeModelFilter::Draggable subclass of TreeModelFilter, for
    use wherever you would have had a plain filter.

  * The DragDest code separately, to mix-in to any TreeModelFilter
    derivative you might further subclass.

The only prerequisite is Gtk2-Perl.  The TreeModelFilter-DragDest home
page is
