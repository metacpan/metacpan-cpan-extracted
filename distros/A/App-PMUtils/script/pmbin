Does this happen often with you: you install a CPAN module:

    % cpanm -n Finance::Bank::ID::BCA

The CPAN distribution is supposed to contain some CLI utilities, but it is not
obvious what the name is. So you do:

    % man Finance::Bank::ID::BCA

to find out, and even the module's POD doesn't give the name of the utility
sometimes. You might even open your browser and go to MetaCPAN. Or
download+extract+view the tarball just to find out.

Now there's a simpler alternative:

    % pmbin Finance::Bank::ID::BCA
    download-bca
    parse-bca-statement

Show full path, process multiple modules at once:

    % pmbin -P Finance/Bank/ID/BCA Finance::Bank::ID::Mandiri
    /home/user/perl5/perlbrew/perls/perl-5.18.2/bin/download-bca
    /home/user/perl5/perlbrew/perls/perl-5.18.2/bin/parse-bca-statement
    /home/user/perl5/perlbrew/perls/perl-5.18.2/bin/download-mandiri
    /home/user/perl5/perlbrew/perls/perl-5.18.2/bin/parse-mandiri-statement

You even get tab completion for free.

<prog:pmbin> works by locating the `.packlist` file for the module (which contains
the list of installed files) and filter only the `/(bin,scripts?)/` ones.

=head1 NAME

pmbin - List scripts that come with the same distribution of a Perl module

=head1 VERSION

This document describes version 0.724 of pmbin (from Perl distribution App-PMUtils), released on 2019-06-20.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Basic usage:

 % pmbin Some::Module

Return full path instead of just names:

 % pmbin -P Some::Module

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Does this happen often with you: you install a CPAN module:

 % cpanm -n Finance::Bank::ID::BCA

The CPAN distribution is supposed to contain some CLI utilities, but it is not
obvious what the name is. So you do:

 % man Finance::Bank::ID::BCA

to find out, and even the module's POD doesn't give the name of the utility
sometimes. You might even open your browser and go to MetaCPAN. Or
download+extract+view the tarball just to find out.

Now there's a simpler alternative:

 % pmbin Finance::Bank::ID::BCA
 download-bca
 parse-bca-statement

Show full path, process multiple modules at once:

 % pmbin -P Finance/Bank/ID/BCA Finance::Bank::ID::Mandiri
 /home/user/perl5/perlbrew/perls/perl-5.18.2/bin/download-bca
 /home/user/perl5/perlbrew/perls/perl-5.18.2/bin/parse-bca-statement
 /home/user/perl5/perlbrew/perls/perl-5.18.2/bin/download-mandiri
 /home/user/perl5/perlbrew/perls/perl-5.18.2/bin/parse-mandiri-statement

You even get tab completion for free.

L<pmbin> works by locating the C<.packlist> file for the module (which contains
the list of installed files) and filter only the C</(bin,scripts?)/> ones.

=head1 OPTIONS

C<*> marks required options.

=head2 Main options

=over

=item B<--full-path>, B<-P>

Show full path instead of just filenames.

=item B<--module-json>=I<s>

See C<--module>.

=item B<--module>=I<s@>*

Can be specified multiple times.

=back

=head2 Configuration options

=over

=item B<--config-path>=I<filename>, B<-c>

Set path to configuration file.

=item B<--config-profile>=I<s>

Set configuration profile to use.

=item B<--no-config>, B<-C>

Do not use any configuration file.

=back

=head2 Environment options

=over

=item B<--no-env>

Do not read environment for default options.

=back

=head2 Output options

=over

=item B<--format>=I<s>

Choose output format, e.g. json, text.

Default value:

 undef

=item B<--json>

Set output format to json.

=item B<--naked-res>

When outputing as JSON, strip result envelope.

Default value:

 0

By default, when outputing as JSON, the full enveloped result is returned, e.g.:

    [200,"OK",[1,2,3],{"func.extra"=>4}]

The reason is so you can get the status (1st element), status message (2nd
element) as well as result metadata/extra result (4th element) instead of just
the result (3rd element). However, sometimes you want just the result, e.g. when
you want to pipe the result for more post-processing. In this case you can use
`--naked-res` so you just get:

    [1,2,3]


=back

=head2 Other options

=over

=item B<--help>, B<-h>, B<-?>

Display help message and exit.

=item B<--version>, B<-v>

Display program's version and exit.

=back

=head1 COMPLETION

This script has shell tab completion capability with support for several
shells.

=head2 bash

To activate bash completion for this script, put:

 complete -C pmbin pmbin

in your bash startup (e.g. F<~/.bashrc>). Your next shell session will then
recognize tab completion for the command. Or, you can also directly execute the
line above in your shell to activate immediately.

It is recommended, however, that you install modules using L<cpanm-shcompgen>
which can activate shell completion for scripts immediately.

=head2 tcsh

To activate tcsh completion for this script, put:

 complete pmbin 'p/*/`pmbin`/'

in your tcsh startup (e.g. F<~/.tcshrc>). Your next shell session will then
recognize tab completion for the command. Or, you can also directly execute the
line above in your shell to activate immediately.

It is also recommended to install L<shcompgen> (see above).

=head2 other shells

For fish and zsh, install L<shcompgen> as described above.

=head1 CONFIGURATION FILE

This script can read configuration files. Configuration files are in the format of L<IOD>, which is basically INI with some extra features.

By default, these names are searched for configuration filenames (can be changed using C<--config-path>): F<~/.config/pmbin.conf>, F<~/pmbin.conf>, or F</etc/pmbin.conf>.

All found files will be read and merged.

To disable searching for configuration files, pass C<--no-config>.

You can put multiple profiles in a single file by using section names like C<[profile=SOMENAME]> or C<[SOMESECTION profile=SOMENAME]>. Those sections will only be read if you specify the matching C<--config-profile SOMENAME>.

You can also put configuration for multiple programs inside a single file, and use filter C<program=NAME> in section names, e.g. C<[program=NAME ...]> or C<[SOMESECTION program=NAME]>. The section will then only be used when the reading program matches.

Finally, you can filter a section by environment variable using the filter C<env=CONDITION> in section names. For example if you only want a section to be read if a certain environment variable is true: C<[env=SOMEVAR ...]> or C<[SOMESECTION env=SOMEVAR ...]>. If you only want a section to be read when the value of an environment variable has value equals something: C<[env=HOSTNAME=blink ...]> or C<[SOMESECTION env=HOSTNAME=blink ...]>. If you only want a section to be read when the value of an environment variable does not equal something: C<[env=HOSTNAME!=blink ...]> or C<[SOMESECTION env=HOSTNAME!=blink ...]>. If you only want a section to be read when an environment variable contains something: C<[env=HOSTNAME*=server ...]> or C<[SOMESECTION env=HOSTNAME*=server ...]>. Note that currently due to simplistic parsing, there must not be any whitespace in the value being compared because it marks the beginning of a new section filter or section name.

List of available configuration parameters:

 format (see --format)
 full_path (see --full-path)
 module (see --module)
 naked_res (see --naked-res)

=head1 ENVIRONMENT

=head2 PMBIN_OPT => str
