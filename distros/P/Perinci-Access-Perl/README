NAME
    Perinci::Access::Perl - Access Perl module, functions, variables through
    Riap

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.891 of Perinci::Access::Perl (from
    Perl distribution Perinci-Access-Perl), released on 2019-07-21.

SYNOPSIS
    First write your code and add Rinci metadata to them:

     package MyMod::MySubMod;

     our %SPEC;

     $SPEC{':package'} = {
         v => 1.1,
         summary => 'This package is blah blah',
     };

     $SPEC{'$var1'} = {
         v => 1.1,
         summary => 'This variable is blah blah',
     };
     our $var1;

     $SPEC{func1} = {
         v => 1.1,
         summary => 'This function does blah blah',
         args => {
             a => { schema => 'int', req => 1 },
             b => { schema => 'int' },
         },
     };
     sub func1 {
         ...
     }
     1;

    then access them through Riap:

     use Perinci::Access::Perl;
     my $pa = Perinci::Access::Perl->new;

     # call function
     $res = $pa->request(call => '/MyMod/MySubMod/func1', {args=>{a=>1, b=>2}});

     # get variables
     $res = $pa->request(get => '/MyMod/MySubMod/$var1');

DESCRIPTION
    This class allows you to access Perl modules, functions, and variables
    through Riap. Only those which have Rinci metadata are accessible. The
    metadata is put in %SPEC package variables, with function names as keys,
    or ":package" for package metadata, or $NAME for variables. Functions
    will be wrapped before executed (unless you pass "wrap => 0" to the
    constructor).

    You should probably use this through Perinci::Access.

FUNCTIONS
  new(%opts) => OBJ
    Constructor. For a list of options, see superclass
    Perinci::Access::Schemeless except for "package_prefix" which are not
    recognized by this class.

  $pa->request($action, $uri, \%extras) => RESP
  $pa->parse_url($url) => HASH
FAQ
  Why %SPEC (instead of %META, %METADATA, %RINCI, etc)?
    The name was first chosen during Sub::Spec era (see BackPAN) in 2011, it
    stuck. By that time I already had had a lot of code written using %SPEC.

  Why wrap?
    The wrapping process accomplishes several things, among others: checking
    of metadata, normalization of schemas in metadata, also argument
    validation and exception trapping in function.

    The function wrapping introduces a small overhead when performing a sub
    call (typically around several to tens of microseconds on an Intel Core
    i5 1.7GHz notebook). This is usually smaller than the overhead of
    Perinci::Access::Perl itself (typically in the range of 100
    microseconds). But if you are concerned about the wrapping overhead, see
    the "wrap => 0" option.
