0.080   2021-06-27  Released-By: PERLANCAR; Urgency: medium

	- Adjust to Data::Dmp 0.241 (RT#136979).


0.07    2015-03-25  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- Update test and prereq version to newer Data::Dmp (0.09+) which
	  produces more compact output.

	- Add note about using Data::Dmp directly.


0.06     2014-11-14  Released-By: PERLANCAR

         - Provide 'dump1' and 'dump_one_line' (again) for backward
           compatibility now as alias to 'dmp'. Breaking this for the sake of
           breaking was foolish.


0.05     2014-11-14  Released-By: PERLANCAR

         [INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES]

         - Switch to Data::Dmp. Now only exports 'dd' and 'dmp'.


0.04     2014-10-03  Released-By: PERLANCAR

         - Replace with a modified Data::Dump 1.22 to minimize whitespaces,
           including padding of hash keys which looks silly.


0.03     2013-09-09  Released-By: SHARYANTO

         - No functional changes. Rebuild with MakeMaker instead of
           Module::Build because the latter is deprecated from core in 5.19.


0.02     2010-10-25  Released-By: SHARYANTO

         - Change dump_oneline -> dump_one_line.


0.01     2010-10-18  Released-By: SHARYANTO

         - First release.
