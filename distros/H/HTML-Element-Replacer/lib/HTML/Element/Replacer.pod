=head1 NAME

  HTML::Element::Replacer - Simplify the HTML::Element clone() - push_content() ritual

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use HTML::Element::Replacer;

  {
   my $replacer = HTML::Element::Replacer->new(tree => $tree, look_down => [ scla => 'mid' ]);
 
   for my $data (@data) {
     $replacer->push_clone->defmap(attr_name => $data); # clone and push onto @temp_list
   }
  }
  # by default Replacer replaces... so it removes the element you were push_clone()ing
 
 
=head1 DESCRIPTION

Let's say you have this HTML:

 <table>

   <tr scla="top"/> 

   <tr scla="mid"> 
     <td kmap="brand"> blah </td>
     <td kmap="age"> blah </td>
   </tr>

   <tr scla="bot"/> 

 </table>

Now let's say you have 5 data rows that you wish to display using the middle C<tr> as your sample.
The pure HTML::Tree way to do this would be:

 my $sample_tr = $tree->look_down(scla => 'mid');

 my @c;
 for my $data (@data) {
    my $c = $sample_tr->clone; 
    $c->defmap(kmap => $data);
    push @c, $c;
 }

 $sample->replace_with(@c);

We did cheat a bit by using C<defmap()> from L<HTML::Element::Library|HTML::Element::Library>.
Now, with this class, we can do this:

 { 	
    my $replacer = HTML::Element::Replacer->new(look_down => [ scla => 'mid' ]);
 
    for my $data (@data) {
	my $clone = $replacer->push_clone->defmap(kmap => $data); # clone and push onto @temp_list
    }

 } # replacer goes out of scope and then replaces sample_tr
