SYNOPSIS
========

The Config.pm included by default with Perl is pure Perl.  Nearly all Perl apps
will load Config.pm.  For a number of reasons, of speed and memory space,
reimplement the P5P shipped Config.pm as an XS library, shareable between
processes as read-only memory, and with a hash that is better optimized than
Perl hashes, courtesy of gperf tool which generates collision-free perfect
hashes.

This module is a drop-in replacement for Config.pm. All code that does

    use Config;

will use the XS implementation after installing this module.  To revert to the
original pure perl Config.pm, go and delete the following 3 files that will be
next to each other in /site, Config.pm, Config_mini.pl, Config_xs_heavy.pl, and
the Config shared library in /auto, after deleting the /site files, the original
pure perl Config.pm in /lib will be loaded.

Since XS Config is a compiled C shared library, it can not be edited with a text
editor after it is built.  To change the values in the XS Config module,
edit the pure perl Config_heavy.pl file with a text editor and rebuild XS
Config.

IT IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED THAT YOU HAVE GPERF TOOL INSTALLED AND RUNNABLE FROM
YOUR PATH BEFORE INSTALLING XS CONFIG.

CONTRIBUTING
============

XS Config is part of the cperl project http://perl11.org/cperl/ .

The files and parts of XS Config that are git tracked by cperl at
https://github.com/perl11/cperl/tree/master/ext/Config
are revised inside/upstream cperl.

Files that are not git tracked by cperl are revised at
https://github.com/perl11/p5-Config with syncronizing from cperl of the cperl
git tracked files to the standalone repo.
