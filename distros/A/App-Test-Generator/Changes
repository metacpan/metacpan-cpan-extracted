Revision history for App-Test-Generator

0.23	Wed Dec 24 10:48:03 EST 2025
	Fix https://www.cpantesters.org/cpan/report/079dba46-d92f-11f0-9642-dde56d8775ea
	Don't give false negative that memberof isn't known
	SchemaExtractor output files now end in .yml not .yaml
	Ensure rand_str isn't called when memberof is set
	When test_empty is set, do the right thing for memberof

0.22	Sun Dec 21 20:59:58 EST 2025
	Added better API to generate
	Added parameter relationship detection (mutually exclusive, required groups, conditional requirements, dependencies, value constraints)
	Improved Object Detection
		Detect factory methods that return instances
		Recognize singleton patterns
		Identify when constructor needs specific parameters
		Handle inheritance (when parent class new() is needed)
	Better Default Value Extraction
		$param = $param || 'default_value'
		$param //= 'default_value'
		$param = defined $param ? $param : 'default'
	Expanded _detect_list_context to
		Better distinguish scalar vs list returns
		Detect void context methods (those that modify state)
		Recognize chaining patterns more reliably Identify error return conventions (undef on failure, etc.)
	Add confidence scoring transparency, explain WHY confidence is what it is:
		_analysis: confidence_factors:
			- "POD documentation present (+30)"
			- "Type validation in code (+20)"
			- "No constraint information (-10)"
	Add support for:
		- Signatures (sub foo($x, $y = 5) { })
		- Postfix dereferencing ($array->@*)
		- Subroutine attributes (sub foo :Returns(Int) { })
		- Field declarations (Perl 5.38+)
	Added a new section to generated YAML:
		yamltest_hints: boundary_values: [0, 1, 100, 255]
		detected from code invalid_inputs: ['', undef, -1]
		from validation checks equivalence_classes: []
