=head1 CLONING SUPPORT

C<MooseX::Extended> offers optional, B<EXPERIMENTAL> support for attribute
cloning, but differently from how we see it typically done. You can just pass
the C<< clone => 1 >> argument to your attribute and it will be cloned with
L<Storable>'s C<dclone> function every time you read or write that attribute,
it will be cloned if it's a reference, ensuring that your object is
effectively immutable.

If you prefer, you can also pass a code reference or the name of a method you
will use to clone the object. Each will receive three arguments:
C<< $self, $attribute_name, $value_to_clone >>. Here's a full example, taken
from our test suite.

    package My::Class {
        use MooseX::Extended types => [qw(NonEmptyStr HashRef InstanceOf)];

        param name => ( isa => NonEmptyStr );

        param payload => (
            isa    => HashRef,
            clone  => 1,  # uses Storable::dclone
            writer => 1,
        );

        param start_date => (
            isa   => InstanceOf ['DateTime'],
            clone => sub ( $self, $name, $value ) {
                return $value->clone;
            },
        );

        param end_date => (
            isa    => InstanceOf ['DateTime'],
            clone  => '_clone_end_date',
        );

        sub _clone_end_date ( $self, $name, $value ) {
            return $value->clone;
        }

        sub BUILD ( $self, @ ) {
            if ( $self->end_date < $self->start_date ) {
                croak("End date must not be before start date");
            }
        }
    }

B<Warning>: Be aware that this is a very useful technique, but cloning can be
very expensive. If you have performance issues, profile your code and see if
removing the safety of cloning can help.
