=head1 NAME

Data::Sah::Manual::Contributing - Contributing to Data::Sah

=head1 VERSION

This document describes version 0.897 of Data::Sah::Manual::Contributing (from Perl distribution Data-Sah), released on 2019-07-19.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document explains how to contribute to L<Data::Sah> developments.

To contribute, you can send a pull request on GitHub, or contact me personally.
Thanks for contributing.

=head1 IMPLEMENTING

=head2 Implementing clauses

Some clauses are not yet implemented. If you are interested in helping out
implementing these, you can first find the list of not-yet-implemented clauses
from the main L<Data::Sah> POD, or from C<t/spectest-perl.t> or
C<t/spectest-js.t>.

You should first uncomment the clause in C<t/spectest-perl.t> or
C<t/spectest-js.t> so that the to-be-implemented clause can be tested.

You should take a look at another implemented clause in
L<Data::Sah::Compiler::perl::TH::$TYPE>, L<Data::Sah::Compiler::js::TH::$TYPE>,
L<Data::Sah::Compiler::human::TH::$TYPE> for example. You'll need to implement
the clause in all of these compilers, for completeness. But it is okay if you
leave out some compilers, I and others will try to help implementing it for you.

You should also update C<Data::Sah> POD (the Status section) to let users know
that the clause has been implemented.

=head2 Implementing other aspects

For example: functions, expression, subschema, etc. Please contact me personally
to discuss things first.

=head2 CREATING TRANSLATION

Translations are put in L<Data::Sah::Lang::$LANGCODE>. Since I am Indonesian,
language C<id_ID> is the most complete. You can use the utility
C<devscripts/list-missing-translations> to list which translation strings are
missing between C<id_ID> and your target language.

=head2 WRITING TUTORIAL/DOCUMENTATION

Tutorials should be put in C<Data::Sah::Manual::Tutorial>. Cookbook-type
documentation are also welcome, they should be put in
C<Data::Sah::Manual::Cookbook> or C<Data::Sah::Manual::Cookbook::*>.

=head2 EXTENDING

L<Data::Sah> is created with extension in mind. You can create new types, add
clauses to existing types, or create a schema that can be shared for others.
Please see L<Data::Sah::Manual::Extending> for more details. The extensions can
be packaged in separate distributions, so you can release them independently of
Data::Sah.
