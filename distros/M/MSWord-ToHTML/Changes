Revision history for MSWord-ToHTML

0.010     2013-12-24
  - Not only footnotes need to be renamed, but
    StarWriter endnotes as well, in order not to
    have colliding names/ids.

  - Remove Word file that cannot be expanded on
    Windows, change test counts accordingly. Thanks
    to Alexandr Ciornii <notifications@github.com>.

0.008 2013-10-06
  - BREAKING: Switch to libreoffice instead of abiword.
    abiword ceased to wrap footnotes in handy
    classes that we could identify. This means that
    any post-processing scripts you may have
    written will now need to look for different
    classnames of footnotes, i.e., sdfootnoteanc for
    footnote refs in the text, and sdfootnotesym
    for footnote contents at the bottom.
  - Use file extension to hint which extractor
    to use.
  - Switch to Dist::Zilla.
  - Remove pernicious "_GoBack" ids in Word docx-xml
    derived HTML.
  - Delete invalid XML characters before passing
    the text to tidy.
