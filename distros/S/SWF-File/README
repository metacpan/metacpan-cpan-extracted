  SWF::Parser          - parsing and splitting SWF files into header and tags.
  SWF::BinStream       - binary stream class for SWF.
  SWF::Binstream::File - binary file stream for SWF.
  SWF::BinStream::Codec::Zlib
                       - zlib compress/decompress codec for SWF::BinStream.
  SWF::Element         - representing each SWF tag and other sub element.
  SWF::File            - making SWF file.

See each POD for further information.

INSTALLATION

You install SWF modules by the usual method:

  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test
  make install

The test script is too simple now.  Please try 'dumpswf.plx' and its output
for various SWF files.

SAMPLE SCRIPT

dumpswf.plx parses a SWF file and converts it to a perl script
that outputs the same SWF file.
There are some samples in samples directory.
