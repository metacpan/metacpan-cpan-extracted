0.06 2014-08-20 bug fix release, update not required

- Addressed issue with XML::Simple (dependency) [RT:62836]

  http://www.cpantesters.org/cpan/report/4dba5ca2-e3fc-11df-b117-fd5467a42f83

  The report had the following error:

    XMLin() requires either XML::SAX or XML::Parser at lib/XML/Conf.pm line 30

  The report was based on use of XML::Simple 2.18. I found this is the Changes file for XML::Simple:

    2.19_02   2012-06-19 20:33:53 Pacific/Auckland
      - Reinstate XML::SAX::Expat dependency

  I have not been able to replicate the error using XML::Simple 2.20 and
  I do not want to dig into XML::Simple history so I am specifying a dependency to 2.20 (from 1.04)

Closing the issue
