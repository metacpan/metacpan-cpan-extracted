        ->granted(sub($entity) { say $entity })                      # "War & Peace"
        ->is_granted;                                                        # yes

DESCRIPTION
    This is a lightweight library for implementing fine-grained access
    control in applications via an intuitive and expressive interface. It
    features a hybrid approach, including aspects of both Role-based access
    control (RBAC) and Attribute-based access control (ABAC).

    At a high level, the workflow is to populate an access control list with
    privilege grants, then initiate a request against that list with the
    specific environment parameters, finally checking if the request is
    permitted by the list

FUNCTIONS
  acl
    Returns a global persistent instance of
    Authorization::AccessControl::ACL. There's nothing special about this
    instance other than being globally accessible -- if your usage requires
    it, you can manually make as many ACL instances as you wish and maintain
    them as you like. This function exists purely as a convenience

    Not exported by default.
