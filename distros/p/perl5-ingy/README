NAME
    perl5-ingy - Ingy's Favorite Perl 5 Feature Set

SYNOPSIS
        use perl5-ingy;

DESCRIPTION
    Using this module is the same as:

        use 5.010;
        use strict;
        use warnings;
        use IO::All;
        use YAML::XS;
        use Capture::Tiny ':all';
        use XXX -with => 'YAML::XS';

    This is an early release. More modules will be added as this framework
    matures.

STATUS
    this module is brand new. Don't use it. I wouldn't if I were you. But
    I'm not you. I use it. But I'm Ingy. This module is named after me. You
    are not Ingy. This module is not named after you.
