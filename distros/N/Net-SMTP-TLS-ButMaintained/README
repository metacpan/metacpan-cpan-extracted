NAME
    Net::SMTP::TLS::ButMaintained - An SMTP client supporting TLS and AUTH
    (DEPRECATED, use Net::SMTPS instead)

VERSION
    version 0.24

SYNOPSIS
     use Net::SMTP::TLS::ButMaintained;
     my $mailer = Net::SMTP::TLS::ButMaintained->new(
            'your.mail.host',
            Hello   =>      'some.host.name',
            Port    =>      25, #redundant
            User    =>      'emailguy',
            Password=>      's3cr3t');
     $mailer->mail('emailguy@your.mail.host');
     $mailer->to('someonecool@somewhere.else');
     $mailer->data;
     $mailer->datasend("Sent thru TLS!");
     $mailer->dataend;
     $mailer->quit;

DESCRIPTION
    DEPRECATED!, Please use Net::SMTPS instead.

    Net::SMTP::TLS::ButMaintained is forked from Net::SMTP::TLS. blame "Evan
    Carroll" for the idea. :)

    Net::SMTP::TLS::ButMaintained is a TLS and AUTH capable SMTP client
    which offers an interface that users will find familiar from Net::SMTP.
    Net::SMTP::TLS::ButMaintained implements a subset of the methods
    provided by that module, but certainly not (yet) a complete mirror image
    of that API.

    The methods supported by Net::SMTP::TLS::ButMaintained are used in the
    above example. Though self explanatory for the most part, please see the
    perldoc for Net::SMTP if you are unclear.

    The differences in the methods provided are as follows:

        The *mail* method does not take the options list taken by Net::SMTP

        The *to* method also does not take options, and is the only method
        available to set the recipient (unlike the many synonyms provided by
        Net::SMTP).

        The constructor takes a limited number of Net::SMTP's parameters.
        The constructor for Net::SMTP::TLS::ButMaintained takes the
        following (in addition to the hostname of the mail server, which
        must be the first parameter and is not explicitly named):

            NoTLS - In the unlikely event that you need to use this class to
            perform non-TLS SMTP (you ought to be using Net::SMTP itself for
            that...), this will turn off TLS when supplied with a true
            value. This will most often cause an error related to
            authentication when used on a server that requires TLS

            Hello - hostname used in the EHLO command

            Port - port to connect to the SMTP service (defaults to 25)

            Timeout - Timeout for inital socket connection (defaults to 5,
            passed directly to IO::Socket::INET)

            User - username for SMTP AUTH

            Password - password for SMTP AUTH

  TLS and AUTHentication
    During construction of an Net::SMTP::TLS::ButMaintained instance, the
    full login process will occur. This involves first sending EHLO to the
    server, then initiating a TLS session through STARTTLS. Once this is
    complete, the module will attempt to login using the credentials
    supplied by the constructor, if such credentials have been supplied.

    The AUTH method will depend on the features returned by the server after
    the EHLO command. Based on that, CRAM-MD5 will be used if available,
    followed by LOGIN, followed by PLAIN. Please note that LOGIN is the only
    method of authentication that has been tested. CRAM-MD5 and PLAIN login
    functionality was taken directly from the script mentioned in the
    acknowledgements section, however, I have not tested them personally.

  ERROR HANDLING
    This module will croak in the event of an SMTP error. Should you wish to
    handle this gracefully in your application, you may wrap your mail
    transmission in an eval {} block and check $@ afterward.

  ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
    This code was blatantly plagiarized from Michal Ludvig's smtp-client.pl
    script. See <http://www.logix.cz/michal/devel/smtp> for his excellent
    work.
