Revision history for Perl extension Starch-Store-Catalyst-Plugin-Session.

0.04 2019-02-18T05:54:31Z

 - Support relative package names in the store_class argument.
 - Migrate build tooling from Dist::Zilla to Minilla.
 - Migrate all the tests from Test::More to Test2::V0.

0.03 2016-10-09

 - Prepend "session:" to the keys so that we're backwards compatible
   with existing stores.

0.02 2016-10-09

 - Support the debug() and log() methods in our fake Catalyst class.
 - Support the setup_session() method in our fake Catalyst class, and
   call it once when the store object is first created as this is the
   place where most stores initialize important bits.
