* Artur Bergman pointed out a bug in the overview docs.

 * From Ivan Kohler.  (rt.cpan.org #14879)
  Without this patch, I was getting a fatal error:
   Can't undef active subroutine at /usr/share/perl5/Module/Refresh.pm line 154.

   This patch changes this to a warning and adds the name of the subroutine that
   triggered it.  I now get the non-fatal warning:

     HTML::Mason::handler: Can't undef active subroutine at
     /usr/share/perl5/Module/Refresh.pm line 154.
