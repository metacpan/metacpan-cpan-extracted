<ul>
<li>Clicking on a message subject displays it</li>
<li> Letters to the left of each line indicate when the message
is tagged as (N)ew, (O)ld, (D)eleted or (F)lagged. Message tagged
as (D)eleted are not actually purged until the <tt>Purge</tt> button is
pressed. Until that time, they can be untagged by using the (U)ndelete
short cut (q.v.) or by displaying the message and using the <tt>Undelete</tt>
button on that screen.
<li>The letters to the right of each message are short cuts
for (S)ave, (R)eply, (F)orward and (D)elete/(U)ndelete. Those functions
are also available by displaying the message and using the correspondingly
named buttons on that screen.</li>
<li>The upward and downward pointing arrows (or the words <tt>Prev</tt> and
<tt>Next</tt>) take you to, respectively, the previous and next screenful of
messages. You can configure how many message count as one screenful
by using the <tt>Options</tt> button. The <tt>Top</tt> and <tt>Bottom</tt> buttons take you
directly to the top or bottom of the mailbox. If you are already at the
top or bottom of the mailbox, the unnecesssary buttons are greyed out
or not displayed at all.</li>
<li>The <tt>Compose</tt> button takes you to the message composition screen
where you can compose and send new messages.</li>
<li>The <tt>Mailboxes</tt> button takes you to a screen where you can select
a different mailbox to view or create, rename or delete mailboxes and
directories.</li>
<li>The <tt>Manage</tt> button takes you to a screen where you can manage your
account: display your disk quota and disk usage, change your password,
set mail forwarding or change and activate/deactiveate a vacation
message.</li>
<li>The <tt>Options</tt> button lets you configure various options for either
the current session or for every future session too.</li>
<li>The <tt>Purge</tt> button deletes from your mailbox all messages that are
tagged as (D)eleted. Once purged, messages <em>cannot</em> be recovered.
Once messages have been tagged as deleted, pressing the <tt>Purge</tt> button
deletes them all immediately-there is no further confirmation dialog.
</li>
<li>The <tt>Address Books</tt> button takes you to a screen where you can
create, browse, search, update and share your address books.
</li>
<li>The <tt>Logout</tt> button brings up a confirmation screen which lets you
then logout of your mail session. You <em>must</em> remember to logout
when you have finished your session.</li>
</ul>
