NAME
    Term::DNAColor - Add colors to DNA and RNA sequences in terminal output

VERSION
    version 0.110460

SYNOPSIS
        use Term::DNAColor;

        print colordna("ATCGGTCNNNTAGCTGAN"), "\n";

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides a function, "colordna", that takes a DNA sequence
    and wraps unambiguous nucleotides in ANSI color codes, so that you can
    print the sequence to a terminal and have it come out colored.

FUNCTIONS
  colordna
    Takes a string representing a DNA sequence and adds ANSI color codes to
    the following nucleotides:

    *   A: green

    *   T: red

    *   C: blue

    *   G: yellow

    U is colorized like T, to accomodate RNA sequences.

    In addition, the entire sequence is rendered in bold.

    This function is exported by default.

  colorrna
    This is simply an alias for "colordna". Both "colordna" and "colorrna"
    will highlight U for uracil. Unlike "colordna", it is not exported by
    default, but only by request.

BUGS AND LIMITATIONS
    Colors are not configurable.

    Please report any bugs or feature requests to
    "rct+perlbug@thompsonclan.org".
