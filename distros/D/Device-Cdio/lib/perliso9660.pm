=head1 NAME

perliso9660 - lower-level wrapper to libiso9660, the ISO 9660 library of the CD Input and Control package

=head1 SYNOPSIS

This is fairly straight-forward wrapper around the C library libiso9660
Although this is perfectly usable on its own, it is expected that the
Object-Oriented interface L<Device::Cdio::ISO9660> is what most people will
want to use. 

There are various constants that are defined here.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Encapsulation is done in two parts. The lower-level Perl
interface is called perliso9660 (this file) and is generated via SWIG.

=head1 SUBROUTINES

=head2 Input Output

=head3 open_iso

Open an ISO 9660 image for reading. Maybe in the future we will have
mode. undef is returned on error.

=head3 open_ext

Open an ISO 9660 image for reading allowing various ISO 9660
extensions.  Maybe in the future we will have a mode. undef is
eturned on error.

=head3 open_fuzzy

Open an ISO 9660 image for reading with some tolerence for positioning
of the ISO9660 image. We scan for $perliso9660::ISO_STANDARD_ID and
use that to set he eventual offset to adjust by (as long as that is <=
i_fuzz).

Maybe in the future we will have a mode. undef is returned on error.

See also open_iso

=head3 open_fuzzy_ext

Open an ISO 9660 image for reading with some tolerence for positioning
of the ISO9660 image. We scan for ISO_STANDARD_ID and use that to set
the eventual offset to adjust by (as long as that is <= i_fuzz).

Maybe in the future we will have a mode. undef is returned on error.

=head3 ifs_fuzzy_read_superblock

Read the Super block of an ISO 9660 image but determine framesize
and datastart and a possible additional offset. Generally here we are
not reading an ISO 9660 image but a CD-Image which contains an ISO 9660
filesystem.

=head3 close

Close previously opened ISO 9660 image.
1 is unconditionally returned. If there was an error 0 would
be returned.

=head3 seek_read

Seek to a position and then read n bytes. (buffer, size) are is returned.

=head3 fs_read_pvd

Read the Primary Volume Descriptor for a CD.
1 is returned if read, and 0 if there was an error.

=head3 ifs_read_pvd

Read the Primary Volume Descriptor for an ISO 9660 image.
1 is returned if read, and 0 if there was an error.

=head3 _fs_read_superblock

Read the Super block of an ISO 9660 image. This is the 
Primary Volume Descriptor (PVD) and perhaps a Supplemental Volume 
Descriptor if (Joliet) extensions are acceptable.

=head3 ifs_read_superblock

Read the Super block of an ISO 9660 image. This is the 
Primary Volume Descriptor (PVD) and perhaps a Supplemental Volume 
Descriptor if (Joliet) extensions are acceptable.

=head2 Time Conversion

=head3 set_dtime

Set time in format used in ISO 9660 directory index record
from a Unix time structure.


=head3 set_ltime

Set "long" time in format used in ISO 9660 primary volume descriptor
from a Unix time structure.

=head3 get_dtime 

Get Unix time structure from format use in an ISO 9660 directory index 
record. Even though tm_wday and tm_yday fields are not explicitly in
dtime, they are calculated from the other fields.

If tm is to reflect the localtime, set "use_localtime" 1, otherwise
tm will reported in GMT.

=head3 get_ltime

Get "long" time in format used in ISO 9660 primary volume descriptor
from a Unix time structure. 

=head2 Character Classification and String Manipulation

=head3 is_dchar

Return 1 if c (an int) is a DCHAR - a character that can appear in an an
ISO-9600 level 1 directory name. These are the ASCII capital
letters A-Z, the digits 0-9 and an underscore.

=head3 is_achar

=head3 name_translate

Convert an ISO-9660 file name that stored in a directory entry into 
what is usually listed as the file name in a listing.
wercase name, and remove trailing ;1's or .;1's and
turn the others into version numbers.

=head3 name_translate_ext

Convert an ISO-9660 file name that stored in a directory entry into
what is usually listed as the file name in a listing.  Lowercase
name if no Joliet Extension interpretation. Remove trailing ;1's or
.;1's and turn the others into version numbers.

=head3 strncpy_pad 

Pad string src with spaces to size len and copy this to dst. If len is
less than the length of src, dst will be truncated to the first len
characters of src.

src can also be scanned to see if it contains only ACHARs, DCHARs,
7-bit ASCII chars depending on the enumeration _check.

In addition to getting changed, dst is the return value.  Note: this
string might not be undef terminated.

=head2 File and Directory Names 

=head3 dirname_valid_p

Check that psz_path is a valid ISO-9660 directory name.

A valid directory name should not start out with a slash (/), 
dot (.) or null byte, should be less than 37 characters long, 
have no more than 8 characters in a directory component 
which is separated by a /, and consist of only DCHARs. 

1 is returned if psz_path is valid.

=head3 pathname_isofy

Take psz_path and a version number and turn that into a ISO-9660
pathname.  (That is just the pathname followed by ";" and the version
number. For example, mydir/file.ext -> MYDIR/FILE.EXT;1 for version
1. The resulting ISO-9660 pathname is returned.

=head3 pathname_valid_p

Check that psz_path is a valid ISO-9660 pathname.  

A valid pathname contains a valid directory name, if one appears and
the filename portion should be no more than 8 characters for the
file prefix and 3 characters in the extension (or portion after a
dot). There should be exactly one dot somewhere in the filename
portion and the filename should be composed of only DCHARs.
  
1 is returned if psz_path is valid.

lsn and return information about it.

Returns stat_t of entry if we found lsn, or undef otherwise.

lsn and return information about it.

Returns stat_t of entry if we found lsn, or undef otherwise.

=head3 fs_stat_translate

Return file status for path name psz_path. undef is returned on error.
pathname version numbers in the ISO 9660 name are dropped, i.e. ;1

Return file status for pathname. undef is returned on error.

=head3 ifs_stat_translate

Return file status for path name psz_path. undef is returned on
error.  pathname version numbers in the ISO 9660 name are dropped,

pointers for the files inside that directory. The caller must free the
returned result.

=head3 ifs_readdir

pointers for the files inside that directory. The caller must free
the returned result.

=head3 get_dir_len

A string is allocated: the caller must deallocate.

=head3 dir_to_name
  
=head3 get_posix_filemode

Returns a POSIX mode for a given p_iso_dirent.

=head2 Primary Volume Descriptor Routines

=head3 get_application_id

Return the PVD's application ID.

undef is returned if there is some problem in getting this.
