Perl Module String::CRC32

This packages provides a perl module to generate checksums from strings
and from files.

Written 19990310 by Soenke J. Peters <peters__perl@opcenter.de>.

The checksums are the same as those calculated by ZMODEM, PKZIP,
PICCHECK and many others.
There's another perl module called String::CRC which allows to calculate
not only 32 bit CRC numbers, but the generated sums differ from those of
the programs mentioned above.

Installation:
   "perl Makefile.PL"
   "make"
   "make test"
   "make install"

If you find any bugs, please send me a good description (or a patch ;-) ).
Thanks to s0lar(at)gmx.li who sent me a patch to replace PerlIO_getc with
PerlIO_read to improve performance.

Have fun,
