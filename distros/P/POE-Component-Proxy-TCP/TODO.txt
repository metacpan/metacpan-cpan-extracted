fix the filter names to be more rational
fix and document the alias names
describe precisely (and audit) the session state and 
  linkage of client and server sessions

change test example to e unit test
  - make testproxy shut down automatically



audit code once more, remove XXX think about stuff in $self->{}
and document


------------------------------ done
# to do:
#   - is_connected_to_server needs to be per client connection! (done)
- re-write the pod t be accurate and have a very small but complete example
(text version of proxy)
- make a cpan type dist that has all the files, makes a dist that has all files,
installs, tests and runs the demo stuff (done)
# - put in module CPAN format (done)
# - Fix manual page to not be for server tcp.pm!
# - take out comments from pasted code! (almost)
# - take out object states and package states crap
# - remove nested code. (done)
# - does this system work or not work for multiple simultaneous connections? yes!
# arrange to pass down client filter (and server filter) args
# put signal hand for ^C (do in app)
# - write very simple use module test like most of the POE components.
# ? write all in one test component using PoCo::Server::HTTP
#   testproxy.pl code, and PoCO::Client:HTTP ? That's a little crazy
#   but it should be easy. Would anyone mind the module dependency needed
#   just for testing?
# document session structure and event flow
# provide default params so minimAL proxy is trivial
# rewrite testproxy to use these defaults
# for each code param indicated which session it runs in.
# rationalize the session alias names to agree with the names
#   used in the session structure part of document
# open issues:
# - closures which can't be user over written are used because
#   we wish access to $self variables and don't have especially access to it!
#   (Except in ClientConnected where the PoCo::Server::TCP does provide
#    a way to access) (partially fixed now with $heap->{self})
# move PoeDebug module to somewhere private.
