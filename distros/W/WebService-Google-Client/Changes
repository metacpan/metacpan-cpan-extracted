  - This is a fork of Moo::Google v0.03 which appears to have been abandoned,
    original author unresponsive since January, 2018. Many thanks for his work.
  - Renamed module to WebService::Google::Client.
  - Modified test directory locations so they'll run with properly with "dzil
    test".
  - Made cursory changes to tests so they will pass and removed event test that
    was badly designed.
  - General quality improvement of distribution and Dist::Zilla configuration
    made.
  - This is not a feature release but will help set stage for future
    improvements.
