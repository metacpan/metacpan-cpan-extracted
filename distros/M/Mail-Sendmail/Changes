Revision history for Perl module Mail::Sendmail

0.82 2025-07-14 NEILB
    - Improvement from Pete Houston to use Sys::Hostname::Long

0.81 2019-05-13 NEILB
    - Fixed typos, reported by dsteinbrunner in RT#88351
    - Fixed typos, reported by Florian Schlichting in RT#119000

0.80 2017-08-20 NEILB
    - NEILB got co-maint to do a release that includes META.yml and META.json.
    - Switched to Dist::Zilla.
    - Added COPYRIGHT section to pod.
    - Fixed the NAME section in pod to follow expected format.
    - Added "use warnings" and fixed all the warnings.
    - Manually set $VERSION, as it's used in the code

0.79_16 2006-07-08 MIVKOVIC
    - experimental SMTP AUTH support (LOGIN PLAIN CRAM-MD5 DIGEST-MD5)
    - Fix bug where one refused RCPT TO: would abort everything 
    - send EHLO, and parse response (for later AUTH implementation)
    - better handling of multi-line responses, and better error-messages
    - Also normalize line endings in headers
    - Now keeps the Sender header if it was used. Previous versions
      only used it for the MAIL FROM: command and deleted it.
    - No space between "MAIL FROM:" or "RCPT TO:" and address.

0.79 2003-02-06 MIVKOVIC
    - Public release with the changes that were in 0.78_2, 0.78_3, 0.78_5,
      and 0.78_6.

0.78_6 2003-02-06
    - Remove old configuration variables from version 0.74.
    - document $mail{Sender}
    - add seconds to Date header (some buggy mailers freak out if
      the time has no seconds)
    - added "/" (\x2F) as a valid character in mailbox part.
    - minor documentation updates

0.78_5 2002-08-24 MIVKOVIC
    - Adapt reference to mail headers in module to new case convention
      (bug introduced in 0.78_2).
    - ppd and PPM install changes...

0.78_3 2002-08-11 MIVKOVIC
    - support multi-line responses
    - define local $\ and $_ in &sendmail to protect us from outside
      settings (is this really needed?)
    - delete $mail{Sender} used for envelope sender, but not needed as header
    - internal rewrite using subs to send and receive on socket

0.78_2 2002-08-11 MIVKOVIC
    - fix old bug with dot as 76th char disappearing.
    - correct very old bug where port number was not extracted from
      stuff like 'my.server:2525'.
    - fix time_to_date bug with negative half-hour zones (only Newfoundland?)
    - use Sys::Hostname to get the hostname for HELO. (I think it has
      been part of the standard distribution for many years now)
    - support different envelope sender through $mail{Sender}
    - Change case of headers: first character after "-" also uppercased
      now, so people who believe this is required because Outlook does it
      this way stop complaining. :-)
    - Enable full session output for debugging
    - Do not copy the mail message again to a different variable.
    - Minor documentation changes.

0.78 2000-09-25 MIVKOVIC
    - Now accepts single-letter host/domain names in addresses. They were
      previously rejected, due to my misunderstanding of an RFC.
    - Removed smtp.site1.csi.com from the default servers. That server is
      not an open relay any more. This leaves only 'localhost' in the
      servers list.

0.77 1999-03-28 MIVKOVIC
    - If connection to 1st server failed, the others failed too, but
      only with certain Perl-version/OS combinations !?!.
      Fixed (hopefuly).

0.76 1999-03-27 MIVKOVIC
    - fixed bug which prevented trying other servers in list if
      connection to first failed.
    - fixed reporting of server in log.

0.75 1999-03-27 MIVKOVIC
    - you can now send attachments, html mail etc... your headers will
      be left alone.
    - can use a list of possible SMTP servers instead of a single one.
    - all configuration now grouped in a %mailcfg hash.
    - removes possible extra line-endings in headers.
    - e-mail address regex changes:
      . now accepts user@[xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx]
      . now refuses commas (they are only valid in quoted strings
        which $address_rx does not support). Comma separated
        recipients lists now work even with no space after the comma.
    - if you used an X-mailer header, the Mail::Sendmail vwersion was
      appended. It isn't any more.
    - removed unnecessary BEGIN{} block.
    - no more warnings on empty Subject.
    - lots's of cleaning up in the code.

0.74 1998-08-01 MIVKOVIC
    - Fixed $/ problem: mailing would hang if caller had redefined
      the record separator. It's now locally set to "\015\012". 
    - corrected reading of %mail hash passed to sendmail: it would
      abort on a false value (the trap is clearly mentionned in the
      perl docs: shame on me!)
    - added configurable retries when failure to connect to server 
    - much more error checking
    - more warnings to STDERR, but only if running with -w flag.
    - changed $address_rx, so it accepts user@hostname, not only
      user@host.top, and also accepts weird but legal characters
    - Message body is now all of Message, Body and Text instead
      of the first not empty one (if you don't mind the final
      message being in random order, you can now be really sloppy
      when filling in the message from your script!).
    - use strict.
    - Added Makefile.PL.
    - updated doc

0.73 1998-07-13 MIVKOVIC
    - Line endings changed again to be Mac compatible at last.
    - Automatic time zone detection.
    - Support for SMTP Port change for single messages.
    - Always default to quoted-printable encoding if possible.
    - Added $Mail::Sendmail::default_sender.

0.72 1998-07-08 MIVKOVIC
    - Fixed line endings in Body to "\r\n".
    - MIME quoted-printable encoding is now automatic if needed.
    - Test script can now run unattended.

0.71 1998-07-07 MIVKOVIC
    - Fixed Time Zone bug with AS port.
    - Added half-hour Time Zone support.
    - Repackaged with \n line endings instead of \r\n.

0.70 1998-06-18 MIVKOVIC
    - First release to CPAN
