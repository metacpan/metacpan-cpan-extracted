XS files for Sys::CpuAffinity module.
-------------------------------------

During build, these *.xs files are copied
to the ./lib directory structure, where
ExtUtils::CBuilder will attempt to compile them.

Any units that fail to compile will be
removed from the ./lib directory tree.

The remaining units that successfully compiled
will be removed and combined into a single
lib/Sys/CpuAffinity.xs file.

Additional contributions to this directory should
follow these guidelines:

  * Exported functions should go under the
    "Sys::CpuAffinity" module and "Sys::CpuAffinity"
    package unless there is a compelling reason to
    use something else.

  * The names of all exported functions (listed below
    the file's "MODULE = Sys::CpuAffinity ..." line)
    should begin with "xs_".

    The test script  t/02-available.t  will try to 
    categorize all the available XS functions that 
    follow these first two conventions.

  * ALL function names should be unique across
    all files in /contrib -- don't rely on any
    pair of files in this directory being mutually
    uncompilable.

  * Files need to end with one or more blank lines,
    or else the aggregated lib/Sys/CpuAffinity.xs
    might not compile.

=======================================================

cpusetGetCpuCount.xs

	Function to count the CPUs on on Irix system.

cpuset_getaffinity.xs
cpuset_setaffinity.xs

	Functions to manipulate affinity. Should work
	for FreeBSD >= 7.1. Requires <sched.h>, 
	<sys/cpuset.h>, and <sys/param.h> headers.
	
irix_sysmp.xs

	Use the sysmp() in Irix to bind a process to a
	SINGLE processor (like the processor_bind()
	restriction in Solaris). Requires <sys/sysmp.h>
	and <sys/types.h> headers.

linux-sched_get_affinity.xs
linux-sched_set_affinity.xs

	Get and set process affinity in Linux. Requires
	the <sched.h> and <linux/unistd.h> headers.

pthread_affinity_np.xs

	Uses pthread_getaffinity_np and pthread_setaffinity_np
	methods available in NetBSD >= 5.0. May also work
	in FreeBSD and/or Linux. These functions only work
	on the calling process and may only work for the
	super-user. Requires <pthread.h> and <sched.h>
	headers, and link with libpthread.a library
	(-lpthread).

solaris_processoraffinity.xs

	Uses  processor_affinity()  function on Solaris
        to perform binding to arbitrary sets of cpus.
        Available in Solaris 11.2. Requires many
        system headers. Also see solaris_processorbind.xs

solaris_processorbind.xs

	Use processor_bind() function in Solaris. Can
	be used to bind a process to a SINGLE cpu.
	Requires <sys/processor.h>, <sys/procset.h>,
	and <sys/types.h> headers. On Solaris >= 11.2
        where solaris_processaffinity.xs compiled
        successfully, the functions in this file will
        not be used.

win32_processaffinity.xs

	Get and set affinity for a bona-fide process on
	MSWin32 and Cygwin. Requires <windows.h> and
	<winbase.h> headers. I'm a little bit uncomfortable
	with some of the hard-coded (magic) numbers.

win32_threadaffinity.xs

	Get and set affinity of a Windows pseudo-process
	-- the result of a fork() call on MSWin32. Within
	Perl, pseudo-processes are characterized by a
	negative process ID. Requires the <windows.h>
	and <winbase.h> headers.

win32_system_info.xs

	Functions to retrieve system info (including
	the number of processors) on Windows systems
	(including Cygwin). Uses the <w32api/windows.h>
	and <w32api/winbase.h> headers.

win32_system_info_alt.xs

	Identical functionality to  win32_system_info.xs  
	but looks for the <windows.h> and <winbase.h> 
	headers. Uses alternate function names in case
	both win32_system_info files successfully compile.


fortytwo.xs

	Sample XS files that should compile on
	any system (or at least any system with
	a compiler). Even if nothing else compiles,
	this will give you a CpuAffinity.xs file and
	demonstrate that XS is available on your
	system.
