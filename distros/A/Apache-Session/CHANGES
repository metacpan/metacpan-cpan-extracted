In near future Apache::Session may require perl 5.6.
If you use perl older than 5.6 - write to alexchorny[AT]gmail.com
and tell me what version do you use, why and will you need newer versions
of Apache::Session.

Changes in 1.51:

Added the Oracle backing store.



Changes in 1.50:

If you are upgrading from a previous version of Apache::Session, please note
these changes:

The Apache::Session::DBI module is gone.  It has been obsoleted by MySQL
and Postgres.  Please read the documentation for the module that corresponds
with your database.

The semaphore locker is no longer used anywhere by default.  If you want
to turn it on, you need to hack the modules themselves, or us
Apache::Session::Flex.

By default, all IDs are now 32-characters long.  You can truncate them
to the previous default of 16 characters by providing the IDLength argument
when tieing your sessions.  Note that you might also need to extend the 
datatype of the ID column in your database schema.

All of the modules have been refreshed.  I suggest reading the documentation
for the ones that you plan to use.

Jeffrey
