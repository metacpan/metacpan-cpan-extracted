=head1 1. TITLE

SOFTWARE INPUT/OUTPUT MANUAL (SIOM)

=head1 2. Identification

DI-IPSC-81445

=head1 3. DESCRIPTION/PURPOSE

=head2 3.1

The Software Input/Output Manual (SIOM) tells a user how to access,
submit inputs to, and interpret output from, a batch or interactive
software system that is run by personnel in a computer center or
other centralized or networked software installation.

=head2 3.2

The SIOM is developed for software systems that will be installed
in a computer center or other centralized or networked software
installation, with users accessing the system via terminals or
personal computers or submitting and receiving inputs and outputs in batch mode.

=head1 7

APPLICATION/INTERRELATIONSHIP

=head2 7.1

This Data Item Description (DID) contains the format and content preparation
instructions for the data product generated by specific and discrete task
requirements as delineated in the contract.

=head2 7.2

This DID is used when the developer is tasked to identify and record information
needed by persons who will submit inputs to, and recieve outputs from, software,
relying on others to operate the software in a computer center or other centralized
or networked software installation.

=head2 7.3

This DID is often used with the Software Center Operator Manual (L<SCOM>)
(DI-IPSC-81444). This pair of manuals is an alternative to the
Software User Manual (SUM) (DI-IPSC-81443).

=head2 7.4

The Contract Data Requirements List (L<CDRL>) (DD 1423) should specify
whether deliverable data are to be delivered on paper or electronic media;
are to be in a given electronic form (such as ASCII, CALS, or compatible
with a specified word processor or other support software);
may be delivered in developer format rather than in the format
specified herein; and may reside in a computer-aided software engineering
(CASE) or other automated tool rather than in the form of a traditional document.

=head2 7.5

This DID supersedes DI-IPSC-80693.

=head1 10. PREPARATION INSTRUCTIONS 


=head2 10.1 General instructions.


=head2 10.1.1 Automated techniques

Use of automated techniques
is encouraged. The term 'document' in this DID means
a collection of data regardless of its medium. 

=head2 10.1.2 Alternate presentation styles

Diagrams, tables,
matrices, and other presentation styles are acceptable substitutes
for text when data required by this DID can be made more readable
using these styles. 

=head2 10.1.3 Title page or identifier with signature blocks.

The document shall include a title page containing, as applicable:
document number; volume number; version/revision indicator; security
markings or other restrictions on the handling of the document;
date; document title; name, abbreviation, and any other identifier
for the systems, subsystems, or items to which the document applies;
contract number; CDRL item number; organization for which the
document has been prepared; name and address of the preparing
organization; distribution statement; and signature blocks for
the developer representative authorized to release the document,
the acquirer representative authorized to approve the document,
and the dates of release/approval. For data in a database or other
alternative form, this information shall be included on external
and internal labels or by equivalent identification methods.

=head2 10.1.4 Table of contents. 

The document shall contain
a table of contents providing the number, title, and page number
of each titled paragraph, figure, table, and appendix. For data
in a database or other alternative form, this information shall
consist of an internal or external table of contents containing
pointers to, or instructions for accessing, each paragraph, figure,
table, and appendix or their equivalents. 

=head2 10.1.5 Page numbering/labeling. 

Each page shall contain
a unique page number and display the document number, including
version, volume, and date, as applicable. For data in a database
or other alternative form, files, screens, or other entities shall
be assigned names or numbers in such a way that desired data can
be indexed and accessed. 

=head2 10.1.6 Response to tailoring instructions. 

If a paragraph
is tailored out of this DID, the resulting document shall contain
the corresponding paragraph number and title, followed by 'This
paragraph has been tailored out.' For data in a database
or other alternative form, this representation need occur only
in the table of contents or equivalent. 

=head2 10.1.7 Multiple paragraphs and subparagraphs. 

Any section, paragraph, or subparagraph in this DID may be written
as multiple paragraphs or subparagraphs to enhance readability.

=head2 10.1.8 Standard data descriptions. 

If a data description
required by this DID has been published in a standard data element
dictionary specified in the contract, reference to an entry in
that dictionary is preferred over including the description itself.

=head2 10.1.9 Substitution of existing documents.

Commercial or other existing documents may be substituted for all or part
of the document if they contain the required data. 

=head2 10.2 Content requirements.

Content requirements begin on the following page. The numbers
shown designate the paragraph numbers to be used in the document.
Each such number is understood to have the prefix '10.2'
within this DID. For example, the paragraph numbered 1.1 is understood
to be paragraph 10.2.1.1 within this DID.
