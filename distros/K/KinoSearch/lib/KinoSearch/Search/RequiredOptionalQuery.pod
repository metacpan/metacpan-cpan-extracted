=head1 NAME

KinoSearch::Search::RequiredOptionalQuery - Join results for two Queries, one required, one optional.

=head1 DEPRECATED

The KinoSearch code base has been assimilated by the Apache L<Lucy> project.
The "KinoSearch" namespace has been deprecated, but development continues
under our new name at our new home: L<http://lucy.apache.org/>

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $foo_and_maybe_bar = KinoSearch::Search::RequiredOptionalQuery->new(
        required_query => $foo_query,
        optional_query => $bar_query,
    );
    my $hits = $searcher->hits( query => $foo_and_maybe_bar );
    ...



=head1 DESCRIPTION

RequiredOptionalQuery joins the result sets of one Query which MUST match,
and one Query which SHOULD match.  When only the required Query matches,
its score is passed along; when both match, the scores are summed.
