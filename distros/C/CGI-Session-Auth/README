CGI::Session::Auth
==================
$Id: README 26 2006-02-21 12:26:19Z geewiz $

CGI::Session::Auth is a Perl class that provides the necessary
functions for authentication in CGI scripts. It uses CGI::Session for
session management and supports several backends for credentials
storage, such as flat file and DBI.

CGI::Session::Auth offers an alternative approach to HTTP 
authentication. Its goal is to integrate the authentication
process into the web application as seamless as possible while keeping
the programming interface simple.

Users can authenticate themselves by entering their user
name and password into a login form. This is the most common way 
of authenticating a web site visitor.

Alternatively, a user can automatically be authenticated by his IP address.
This is useful when authorized users can't be bothered to log in manually
but can be identified by a range of fixed IP addresses.

CGI::Session::Auth manages a profile for every user account,
containing his user name, his password and his user id. The user id is
a 32-character string unique for every user. A user profile can
contain additional fields for arbitrary data.
