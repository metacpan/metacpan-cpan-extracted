NAME

      CGI-Prototype - Create a CGI application by prototyped subclasssing

SYNOPSIS
      package My::HelloWorld;
      use base CGI::Prototype;

      sub template { \ <<'END_OF_TEMPLATE' }
      [% self.CGI.header; %]
      Hello world at [% USE Date; Date.format(date.now) | html %]!
      END_OF_TEMPLATE

      My::HelloWorld->activate;

DESCRIPTION
    The core of every CGI application seems to be roughly the same:

    *   Analyze the incoming parameters, cookies, and URLs to determine the
        state of the application (let's call this "dispatch").

    *   Based on the current state, analyze the incoming parameters to
        respond to any form submitted ("respond").

    *   From there, decide what response page should be generated, and
        produce it ("render").

    CGI::Prototype creates a "Class::Prototyped" engine for doing all this,
    with the right amount of callback hooks to customize the process.
    Because I'm biased toward Template Toolkit for rendering HTML, I've also
    integrated that as my rendering engine of choice. And, being a fan of
    clean MVC designs, the classes become the controllers, and the templates
    become the views, with clean separation of responsibilities, and
    "CGI::Prototype" a sort of "archetypal" controller.
