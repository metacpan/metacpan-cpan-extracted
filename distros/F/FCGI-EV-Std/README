NAME

    FCGI::EV::Std - Handler class to use with FCGI::EV

VERSION

    This document describes FCGI::EV::Std version v1.3.3

SYNOPSIS

        use FCGI::EV::Std;
    
        # configuration example
        $FCGI::EV::Std::BLOCKING   = 0;
        $FCGI::EV::Std::MAX_STDIN  = 10*1024*1024;
        $FCGI::EV::Std::MAIN       = \&nonblocking_main;
        $FCGI::EV::Std::HUP        = \&hup;
    
        # for usage example see FCGI::EV module SYNOPSIS

DESCRIPTION

    This module must be used together with FCGI::EV. It will handle CGI
    requests received by FCGI::EV. Both blocking and non-blocking CGI
    request handling supported.

    It will validate size of STDIN: do not accept size larger than
    configured in $MAX_STDIN (1 MB by default), do not accept incomplete
    STDIN (less than $ENV{CONTENT_LENGTH} bytes) - in both cases HTTP reply
    "417 Expectation Failed" will be returned to browser.

    In non-blocking mode it optionally may call user callback function if
    web server disconnect before CGI sent it reply (to interrupt processing
    this request, if possible).

    It compatible with CGI.pm (CGI.pm must be loaded before FCGI::EV::Std
    to activate this feature, and you'll need CGI::Stateless module), but
    may also work with other modules which parse CGI parameters - in this
    case these modules must support work in persistent environment and user
    probably has to re-initialize that module state between requests.

INTERFACE

    There no user-callable methods in this module. Instead, it will call
    user functions.

    In default configuration it will work in blocking mode and will call
    main::main() on each incoming request, with prepared %ENV, STDIN and
    STDOUT, so user code may work just as usual CGI application. Other CGI
    requests will not be processed until main::main() returns. Data printed
    by main::main() to STDOUT will be sent to web server only after
    main::main() returns.

    It also possible to configure FCGI::EV::Std to work in non-blocking
    mode. In this case on each incoming requests it will call
    main::main($server), where $server is FCGI::EV object. In this case
    main::main() shouldn't do any blocking operations (like using SQL
    database) but may setup any events (I/O, timer, etc.) using EV module
    and should returns quickly. Other CGI requests will be processed in
    parallel while this CGI request wait for events. After CGI will have
    some data to send, it should use $server->stdout($data, $is_eof) method
    (if $server is still defined - it may become undef if connection to web
    server related to this CGI request was already closed). In addition,
    FCGI::EV::Std may be configured to call any user function, say,
    main::hup($server) if connection to web server will be closed before
    CGI sent it reply. WARNING! User shouldn't keep non-weaken() references
    to $server in it code!

    See also FCGI::EV::Std::Nonblock - it's helper module which make
    writing non-blocking CGI ease.

    Use these global variables to configure FCGI::EV::Std:

    $FCGI::EV::Std::BLOCKING = 1

      If true, then user function set in $FCGI::EV::Std::MAIN will be
      called in blocking mode and without any parameters.

      If false, then user function set in $FCGI::EV::Std::MAIN will be
      called in non-blocking mode, with parameter $server. Also, if
      $FCGI::EV::Std::HUP set to user function, then it will be called if
      connection to web server is closed before CGI sent it reply.

    $FCGI::EV::Std::MAX_STDIN = 1*1024*1024

      Limit on STDIN size. Increase if you need to receive large files
      using POST.

    $FCGI::EV::Std::MAIN = \&main::main

      User function called to process (or start processing in non-blocking
      mode) incoming CGI request.

    $FCGI::EV::Std::HUP = undef

      User function called only in non-blocking mode to notify about closed
      connection and, if possible, interrupt current CGI request.

      This function got one parameter - $server object. It's same $server
      as was given to $FCGI::EV::Std::MAIN function when this request was
      started (this is how user can identify which of currently executing
      requests was interrupted). The $server object will be destroyed
      shortly after that.

DIAGNOSTICS

    open STDIN: %s

    open STDOUT: %s

      If anybody will see that, then probably your perl is broken. :)
