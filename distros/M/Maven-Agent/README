        my $agent = Maven::Agent->new(agent => $lwp);
    
        my $maybe_artifact = $agent->resolve(
            'javax.servlet:servlet-api:2.5');
        if ($maybe_artifact) {
            # use it
        }
    
        my $artifact = $agent->resolve_or_die(
            'javax.servlet:servlet-api:2.5');
    
        my $servlet_api_jar = $agent->download('javax.servlet:servlet-api:2.5');
    
        $agent->download('javax.servlet:servlet-api:2.5',
            to => '/path/to/some/directory');

DESCRIPTION

    The default agents for working with Maven artifacts.

CONSTRUCTORS

 new([%options])

    Creates a new agent. %options is passed through to "new([%options])" in
    Maven::Maven.

METHODS

 download($artifact, [%options])

    Downloads $artifact and returns the path to the downloaded file. The
    current options are:

    to

      The path to download the artifact to. If the path is a directory, the
      download filename will be artifactId.packaging. Defaults to a
      temporary location. If it is the temporary location, the type of the
      return value is actually a blessed object that overrides the ""
      operator so that it behaves like a string path. This allows the
      temporary file to be cleaned up when the object goes out of scope.

 get_maven

    Returns the Maven::Maven object.

 is_local($artifact)

    Returns a truthy value if $artifact is found in the local repository.
    This method expects $artifact to have already been resolved.

 resolve($artifact, [%parts])

    Will attempt to resolve $artifact. $artifact can be either an instance
    of Maven::Artifact or a coordinate string of the form
    groupId:artifactId[:packaging[:classifier]]:version
    <https://maven.apache.org/pom.html#Maven_Coordinates> If resolution was
    successful, a new Maven::Artifact will be returned with its uri set.
    Otherwise, undef will be returned. If %parts are supplied, their values
    will be used to override the corresponding values in $artifact before
    resolution is attempted.

 resolve_or_die($artifact)

    Calls resolve, and, if resolution was successful, the new $artifact
    will be returned, otherwise, croak will be called.
