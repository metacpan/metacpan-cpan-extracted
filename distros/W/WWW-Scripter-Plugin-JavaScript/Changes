Revision history for WWW::Scripter::Plugin::JavaScript

0.009   21 June, 2016
        The JavaScript plugin:
        • Destructors no longer clobber  $@  (RT #108646).  Thanks to
          Oleg G for the patch.

0.008a  21 October, 2012
        LWP 6 supports perl 5.8.7 once more,  so we no longer require
        Bundle::LWP5_837.
        JE back end (0.009):
        • Window methods are now bound properly,  eliminating  errors
          with  JE::Object::Proxy  objects  (RT  #79855).  Thanks  to
          Nathan Chaney for the report.

0.008   4 December, 2011
        The JavaScript plugin:
        • The JavaScript plugin now calls  ->destroy  on the back end
          when it has finished with it.  This gives the  back  end  a
          chance to destroy any circular  references  it  might  have.
        JE back end:
        • It now takes advantage of JE’s new JE::Destroyer module, to
          eliminate circular references.

0.007   26 March, 2011
        Makefile.PL now requires Bundle::LWP5_837 instead of LWP on
        perl 5.8.7 and lower,  since  LWP  6 does not support 5.8.7.
        The JavaScript plugin:
        • An internal change that should not affect the  interface:
          The  JavaScript  plugin no longer implements  the  screen
          object. WWW::Scripter now implements it, as should always
          have been the case.

0.006   18 January, 2010
        The JavaScript plugin:
        • The docs have  been  updated  to  clarify  that  back  ends’
          event2sub  and  eval  methods must  set  $@  on  error  and
          return normally.
        • Some more doc changes  to  reflect  the  current  state  of
          SpiderMonkey support.
        JE back end (0.007):
        • event2sub  now sets  $@  instead of dying if there is a syn-
          tax error.

0.005   14 February, 2010
        The JavaScript plugin:
        • Incompatible changes:
          • set  now expects a  WWW::Scripter  object  as  the  first
            argument.
          • new_function,  which used to offer no more  functionality
            than  set,  now adds the function to all JS  environments,
            including future ones (a bit like bind_classes).
        • New back_end method
        • The eval method is now public (it was there all along,  but
          the docs were removed  in  the  conversion  from  the  Mech
          plugin  to  the  Scripter  plugin;  the  interface  changed
          slightly in the process).
        • JE is now the default back end. SpiderMonkey used to be the
          back end,  but there was never one available,  so that made
          no difference.  Now there is a SpiderMonkey back  end  (not
          included),  but it is so full of bugs we need to wait a bit
          before flipping the switch back.
        JE back end (0.006):
        • A piece of JavaScript code  calling  a  method  on  another
          global object no longer dies.  This was broken  by  0.004’s
          multiple-window clean-up.
        • Modified to make use of the plugin’s  new  back_end  method,
          to reduce memory usage.

0.004   25 October, 2009
        The JavaScript Plugin:
        • Scripts in frames now run in the context of the frame,  not
          the top-level window.
        JE back end (0.005):
        • We now explicitly require version 0.032 of HTML::DOM::Inter-
          face.  (This should have been added  in  the  previous  ver-
          sion.)

0.003   9 October, 2009
        The JavaScript plugin:
        • Updated to work with  HTML::DOM  0.032’s new event  handler
          model. This fixes various bugs involving event handler prop-
          erties (‘theForm.onsubmit’).
        • Calling  WWW::Scripter’s  eval  method would run  the  Java-
          Script code always in the main window,  if when called from
          the WWW::Scripter object corresponding to a frame. This has
          been fixed. This is part of the solution to the frames prob-
          lem mentioned below.
        •‘require WWW::Scripter::Plugin::JavaScript’  no longer  dies
          if WWW::Scripter is not already loaded.
        JE back end (0.004):
        • We now support those utterly useless  HTML-generating  meth-
          ods of string objects that have  been  part  of  JavaScript
          since the very beginning,  and which have been added solely
          for completeness’ sake.
        • We now override JE’s exists method, so that collection prop-
          erties of the window object appear in scope and can be seen
          by hasOwnProperty.
        • Likewise updated to work with the new event  handler  model.
        • The scope  of  an  event  handler  now  includes  the  docu-
          ment object.
        • For those cases where HTML::DOM  provides UTF-16 methods in
          addition to the usual ones,  JavaScript now uses the UTF-16
          versions.  (This makes  textNode.data.length  equivalent to
          textNode.length.)
        • It used to be that frames with no scripts in them that were
          accessed by JavaScript code in the main window would  share
          the global  object  with  the  main  window.  Also,  window
          objects,  if referenced by JavaScript variables in  another
          frame,  would continue to refer to the same  global  object
          when the frame was navigated.  This mess  has  been  mostly
          cleaned up. There are a few rough edges that will be ironed
          out in a future release.

0.002c  27 August, 2009
        JE back end (0.003):
        • This release simply fixes a test  to  check  for  JE  0.035
          instead of  JE  0.034  before deciding not to skip  a  test.
          (The version has been changed as  the  module’s  docs  have
          changed.)

0.002b  25 August, 2009
        JE back end:
        • It now turns on  JE’s HTML mode  (to support HTML  comments
          embedded in JavaScript).  Version 0.034 of  JE  is required
          for this feature to work.

0.002a  16 August, 2009
        HTML::DOM 0.027 and WWW::Scripter 0.004  are now required.  A
        bug fix in JE 0.033 causes the tests to trigger bugs in previ-
        ous versions of those two modules.

0.002   15 August, 2009
        The JavaScript plugin:
        • Fixed the init callback interface to  match  the  docs  (it
          gets passed  the  WWW::Scripter  object,  not  the  plugin).
        • Fixed  a  bug  introduced  in  0.001  (the  switch  to
          WWW::Scripter) that caused the same JavaScript environ-
          ment to be used for all pages

0.001   5 April, 2009
        First version. Just a renamed and tweaked version of the Mech-
        anize JavaScript plugin (see below).


Revision history for WWW::Mechanize::Plugin::JavaScript and ::DOM

0.009c  11 March, 2009
        The DOM plugin (0.013):
        • parent has been added to
          %WWW::Mechanize::Plugin::DOM::Window::Interface (RT
          #43582 again).

0.009b  11 March, 2009
        An upload mistake. Please ignore.

0.009a  5 March, 2009
        The DOM plugin (0.012):
        • window->top  now actually returns the  top  window,  rather
          than the parent.
        • window->parent has been added (RT #43582 again).

0.009   27 February, 2009
        The DOM plugin (0.011):
        • Just doc fixes:  The frame features are listed in  ::Window,
          and a previously fixed bug has been deleted from  the  list.
        The JavaScript plugin:
        • <!-- -->  is supported in external JS libraries (RT #43582)
          and in javascript: URLs.
        • Trailing --> no longer requires // (RT #43582).
        • Line numbers are now correct after  a  <!--  with  multiple
          line breaks before it.

0.008   23 January, 2009
        The DOM plugin (0.010):
        • Scripts that are sent with a  transfer  encoding  (such  as
          gzip) now work.
        • navigator->appVersion
        • count_timers
        The JavaScript plugin:
        • check_timeouts has been removed.
        JE backend (0.007):
        •‘var x;’  now creates the global var instead of being  a  no-
          op (broken in 0.006).
        • Event handlers in an event attribute of a <form> element no
          longer die when variables are named.  (Thanks to  Imre  Rad
          for alerting me to this.) (This was broken all the way back
          in version 0.002.)

0.007a  18 October, 2008
        The DOM plugin (0.009):
        • The  location  object’s  hash  method now returns an  empty
          string when there is no  fragment,  instead  of  ‘#’  (with
          warnings).

0.007   15 October, 2008
        The DOM plugin (0.008):
        • Modifications to comply with recent changes to LWP and Mech.
        The JavaScript plugin:
        • Likewise

0.006   25 September, 2008
        The DOM plugin (0.007):
        • The window object is now part of the event dispatch chain.
        • The window method no longer dies when the page is not
          HTML. As a result, you can now run JS code without an
          HTML document.
        • When a link in the DOM is clicked (via trigger_event or the
          click method), it now goes to another page.
        • It now provides Mech with handlers for extracting links and
          images from the DOM.
        • Scripts are properly decoded and are no longer always
          treated as Latin 1.
        • The DOM tree’s charset attribute is now set.
        • The scripts_enabled method now disables event handlers as
          well as <script>s.
        • !doctype declarations are no longer dropped from the HTML
	  returned by Mech’s ‘content’ method.
        • Frames (including inline frames) are now supported. The win-
          dow object now has its ‘top’,  ‘frames’ and  ‘length’  meth-
          ods; and you can use it as a hash or array to access frames.
        • The document object now has its location  object set.  This
          was broken in 0.005. (Thanks to David Williams for noticing
          the bug.)
        The JavaScript plugin:
        • You can now specify custom functions for alert, etc., even
          after the JS environment has been created.
        JE back end:
        • Methods returning window objects now work  properly  instead
          of returning weird objects that die when you so much as look
          at them.
        • The global object can now be used as an array or hash to
          access frames.

0.005a  7 September, 2008
        The DOM plugin (0.006):
        • The  window  object’s  *_function  methods  (alert_function,
          etc.)  have been renamed to  set_*_function,  which is what
          the docs already said;  and they actually work  now.  As  a
          result,  the corresponding options to the JavaScript plugin
          now work again. (They were broken in the previous release.)
        JE back end (0.005):
        • Properties and methods  that  are  supposed  to  return
          DOMStrings can now return null. They used to return the
          string ‘undefined’.

0.005   7 September, 2008
        The DOM plugin:
        • New scripts_enabled method for enabling/disabling scripts.
        • The window object has been disentangled from the JavaScript
          plugin and made its own Perl class, under the DOM namespace.
          It is accessible via the ‘window’ method.
          • This allows the window  object  to  inherit
            from HTML::DOM::EventTarget, which provides
            addEventListener, onclick, etc.
          • As a bonus, it has a ‘self’ method.
        • The JS plugin’s check_timeouts method is now deprecated. Use
          the DOM plugin’s new check_timers method instead.
        The JavaScript plugin:
        • Support for javascript: URLs
        • The JavaScript back end’s constructor is now called with the
          window object as its argument.  It has to  make  the  global
          object delegate to the window.
        JE back end (0.004):
        • Modified to conform to the previous item. It does not yet
          support wrapping global objects when they are  passed  to
          other JS environments.

0.004   19 August, 2008
        The DOM plugin:
        • <body onload=...> now works.
        • The DOM plugin can now be C<require>d without Mech already
          loaded, so it works with tools like pmvers.
        The JavaScript plugin:
        • The location object now stringifies to its href property
          instead of [object Location].

0.003   29 July, 2008
        The DOM plugin:
        • Event attribute handlers now receive URL and line
          number info.
        • On a page that has no Content-Script-Type header, a
          script element with no language specified no longer
          causes warnings.
        • It used to be that,  if multiple script elements  or  event
          attributes used the same  handler,  and  that  handler  was
          passed to the plugin with a regexp to select it (as opposed
          to 'default'),  only every other script/event would be trig-
          gered  (forgot to clear a couple of hash  iterators).  This
          has been fixed. 
        • $mech->content now returns the content in the encoding of
          the page itself, rather than the encoding of the first page
          encountered.
        The JavaScript plugin:
        • The engine method (experimental and undocumented--read the
          source) has been added.
        • clear_timeouts now actually works properly. It used to run
          the code for each timeout only if the specified  time  had
          *not* elapsed.
        • Line numbers for event attributes are now passed to the back
          end’s event2sub method.
        JE back end:
        • Read-only properties are now marked as such in the JS  envi-
          ronment  (which prevents the setting of a property if a pro-
          totype has a read-only property of the same name --the only
          difference it makes) and now have their types (string,  num-
          ber, etc.) set properly.
        • Class bindings now use JE’s ‘unwrap’ feature, so version
          0.022 is now required.
        • event2sub now supports line numbers.

0.002   23 December, 2007
        The DOM plugin:
        • The DOM plugin’s interface has changed.  The  callback  rou-
          tines passed to it now get a WWW::Mechanize object as their
          first argument.
        • Line numbers for inline scripts now work properly.
        The JavaScript plugin:
        • You can now set up class bindings before fetching the first
          page (it used to die).
        • CSS::DOM is now a prerequisite.
        • setTimeout and clearTimeout have been added, along with the
          check_timeouts plugin method.
        • There is now a ‘screen’ object, but it has no properties.
          You have to  set  them  yourself  with  an  ‘init’  call-
          back routine.
        • There is an  ‘open’  method which simply moves to the  next
          page, ignoring all arguments except the first. It is just a
          temporary placeholder.
        • The navigator object now has an appName property, set to
          WWW::Mechanize.
        • Back-ends are now expected to accept a third argument to
          new_function, indicating the return type (the JE binding
          supports this of course :-).
        • JavaScript code referenced in the page itself (as opposed to
          code passed to the plugin’s eval method)  used to  be  evalu-
          ated in the same JS environment  for  all  pages.  This  has
          been fixed.
        JE back end:
        • JS event handlers for HTML elements now have the form in the
          scope chain.  (This applies to  all  elements  that  have  a
         ‘form’ method.)
        • JS event handlers now have the ‘this’ value set correctly.

0.001   24 November, 2007
        First CPAN release
        • The JavaScript plugin has been completely restructured. It
          now supports multiple backends.
        • It now allows one to provide an initialisation function that
          is run whenever a JavaScript environment is created, as well
          as custom alert, confirm and prompt functions.
        • Allows binding of custom Perl classes via 'bind_classes'.
        • The DOM plugin’s callback routines  for  fetching  the  page
          content as HTML or text now check to see whether the page is
          HTML first.
        • The DOM plugin now overrides extract_forms.
        • Started work on event-handling.
        • A few other minor things

0.0.2   19 July, 2007
        Updated ::DOM to work with a new patch for WWW::Mechanize
        (modified according to Eric Wilhelm's suggestion) 

0.0.1   17 July, 2007
        A proof-of-concept sent to Andy Lester and to the LWP mailing
        list.  Requires a  patch  to  WWW::Mechanize  (also  sent  to
        the list).
