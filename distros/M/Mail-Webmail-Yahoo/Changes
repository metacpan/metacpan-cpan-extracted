Revision history for Perl extension Mail::Webmail::Yahoo.

0.601 Sat Oct 18 23:53:47 EDT 2003
  - Added installation of yahootils.pl to Makefile.PL. Bah.


0.600
	- Fixed sending buglet - generation of spurious warnings.
	- Added support for signature attachment, and send-message-as-html.
  - Added 'yahootils.pl' script with 'empty' action, to empty specified
    folders. Supporting code added in Yahoo.pm to follow 'Empty' links.
  - yahootils supercedes sendhoo and snagmail. 
  - Yahoo::send() now accepts array-refs for To, Cc, and Bcc (scalars ok too)
  - yahootils will read a message from STDIN, stopping at EOT (or ^.\s*$,
    like SMTP), if --message is not provided.
  - Changed README, updated documentation.
  - Fixed bug where only  the current page of messages would be harvested if
    the user settings cause the last page to be displayed by default.


0.5a Tue Aug 19 02:43:49 GMT 2003 (pre-release for off-site testing)
	- Fixed broken attachment code.
	- Removed some deprecated methods from Yahoo.pm
	-	Added filtering function to remove matching tag-sections in
	  MessageParser.pm
	-	Renamed MP:parse_body(_as_xxx) methods to body($1), and broke parsing down 
	  into multiple steps.
	- Fixed bug with surplus unshifting of mime-type and content boundary into
	  message body.
	- MessageParser can now render messages in HTML. It will also attempt to
	  guess the correct type based on the presence/ absence of an HTML tag in
	  the message, or a Content-Type in the message header.
	- Added '_process_message', '_extract_header', and '_extract_body' methods,
	  mostly to break up some longer pieces of code, but also to allow parsing
	  of a page from a disk file or other local storage.
	- Added CREDITS file.

0.30i  Sun Oct 20 12:26:08 EDT 2002

  - Set default trace level to 1 in snagmail.pl and sendhoo.pl.
  - Converted many constant strings to pre-compiled regexps.

    o  Added 'Textractor' mini-class to remove HTML tags from mail headers.
    o  Changed MESSAGE_START_STRING and friends
    o  Changed LOOKS_LIKE_A_HEADER and mail_header_names - regexps instead of
       simple strings.

other items.
