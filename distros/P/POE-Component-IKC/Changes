    - Fixed thunk checking for 1.311
    - Added IKC::Timing, temporarily
    - Created a new, faster protocol (IKC0) which sends all info on one line
      as opposed to multiple lines as before (IKC)
    - Channel session will detach itself from Client session

0.2200 08 May 2009
    - Better concurrency handling
    - We now have a reusable thunk session
    - Added test cases for above
    - Reworked t/30_concurrency.t Seems it was failing on Win32
    - Added ClientLite->responded()

    - IKC::Channel uses presence of IKC alias, not {shutdown}, to unregister
    - Added a _child to shut up POE::Session
    - Changed the DEPRECATED messages that fluster everybody into
        pointers to IKC/monitor.  I'm not going to remove on_connect nor
        on_error.
    - Allow IKC::Server port=0

0.2101 01 May 2009
    - IKC::Channel stops work during shutdown

0.2003 03 April 2009
    - IKC::Channel->spawn returns session ID
    - Only keep channel IDs in IKC::Responder

    - Several changes to improve shutdown behaviour :
        - Register channels with the IKC::Responder before they negociate
        - Shutdown a IKC::Client when its Channel closes, so that IKC 
            shutdown will also shutdown the channels
        - Give Clients aliases to help debuging
        - Shutdown IKC::Server when the last channel goes away and 
            there's no wheel
    
0.2002 26 November 2008
    - Added call to $kernel->_data_sig_initialize, otherwise child processes

        Ernesto Hernandez-Novich.

    - Uses sig_handled() where appropriate

0.14pre2 16 Oct 2002
    - Now uses *Event rather then *State

    - inform_monitor is now an event
    - IKC::Proxy post()s to inform_monitor in _start
    - IKC::Proxy call()s inform_monitor in _stop
    - Merged up alias listing in publish/retract

0.1303 26 Oct 2001
    - IKC::Responder->spawn returns true on success
    - IKC::Responder->spawn documented
    - Checking to make sure a publishing session has an alias.  if not, use ID
    - First babysitting happens at startup, doesn't wait
    - check_kernel brought in line w/ new kernel internals

0.1302 6 Sept 2001
    - Meaningless version change

0.1301 24 July 2001
    - unix domain paths in kernel names now have / and \ turned into _
    - Local kernel gets many names
    - Make sure sockets are open before syswrite during neg phase of 
        ClientLite, allowing better error handling
    - IKC::Responder::spawn now checks that only one responder exists
    - alias_list is only supported after 0.15
    - Added win32 support (WSAEAFNOSUPPORT)

0.13  13 July 2001
    - Added and repaired serializer selection for clients
    - Added doco for ClientLite
    - Sungo is happy with this release... onto CPAN it goes.

0.13pre9  5 July 2001
    - Doco fixes

0.13pre8  4 July 2001
    - Fixed the deprecated use of defined(@array) in IKC/Responder.pm
    - Added doco about SENDER
    - create_ikc_channel now takes an arrayref of aliases, 
      so that IKC::Client and IKC::Server can accept a longer list of
      pre-defined names.
    - IKC/post2 now expects SENDER to come before [state, args]
    - Added doco to the effect that callback states are temporarily published
    - Updated code that turned off the socket_factory... Dngor had
      changed SocketFactory's implementation on me!  This is what you get
      for doing bad stuff.

0.13pre7  20 June 2001
    - Added IKC/published, for sungo
    - Fixed doco a bit
    - Added a prereq for POE 0.1403

0.13pre6  6 June 2001
    - ADDED TESTS!
        Woot woot!  Now make test verifies something meaningful.
    - No longer thunking sessions that don't publish any states
    - Finally did unsubscribe... turns out retract was available all along
    - Added IKC::{Client,Proxy,Responder,Server}->spawn method, to 
        be used in favour of create_ikc_*mumble*
    - Added IKC/post2 .... internal use only
    - Added FlushedState handler to IKC::Channel.  This way, wheel isn't
        destroyed until all data is flushed.  This means you can post
        events to remote kernels and then IKC/shutdown right away.  I hope.

0.13pre5  4 June 2001
    - Added IKC/shutdown and attendant bouffonery (see shut-{server,client})
    - IKC::Proxy for 'poe://somekernel/somesession' is now also aliased
      as 'somesession'

    - Updated Changes, README.  Added FUTUR

      (doing it was unneed, server does it automatically when socket dies)

0.11  Nov 16 2000
    - IKC/ClientLite now sets $/ and $\ to "\r\n"
    - wantarray() now gets propagated... is this tested?
    - babysitting now knows of "defunct" children
