NAME
    String::Urandom - An alternative to using /dev/random

SYNOPSIS
      use String::Urandom;

      my $obj = String::Urandom->new(
          LENGTH => 55,
          CHARS  => [ qw/ a b c 1 2 3 / ]
        );

      print $obj->rand_string, "\n";

DESCRIPTION
    Using output from /dev/urandom. Simply convert bytes into 8-bit
    characters.

PREREQUISITES
      Params::Validate

INSTALLATION
    From source:

      $ tar xfz String-Urandom-0.X.X.tar.gz
      $ perl MakeFile.PL PREFIX=~/path/to/custom/dir LIB=~/path/to/custom/lib
      $ make
      $ make test
      $ make install

    Perl one liner using CPAN.pm:

      $ perl -MCPAN -e 'install String::Urandom'

    Use of CPAN.pm in interactive mode:

      $ perl -MCPAN -e shell
      cpan> install String::Urandom
      cpan> quit

    Just like the manual installation of Perl modules, the user may need
    root access during this process to insure write permission is allowed
    within the installation directory.

OBJECT METHODS
  new
    Create a new session object. Configuration items may be passed as a
    parameter.

      my $obj = new String::Urandom;

        or

      my %params = (
          LENGTH => 55,
          CHARS  => [ qw/ a b c 1 2 3 / ]
        );

      my $obj = String::Urandom->new(\%params);

  str_length
    This method will Set/Get the string character length.

    The default value is: 32

      $obj->str_length(55);

  str_chars
    This method will Set/Get characters used for generating a string.

    The default value is: a-z A-Z 0-9

      $obj->str_chars('a b c 1 2 3');

  rand_string
    This method generates a new random string.

      $obj->rand_string;

PARAMETERS
  LENGTH
    Defines the length of the string in characters.

    The default value is: 32

  CHARS
    Defines the characters used for generating the string.

    The default value is: a-z A-Z 0-9

REQUIREMENTS
    Any flavour of UNIX that supports /dev/urandom

SECURITY
    In general, the longer the string length and total characters defined,
    the more secure the output result will be.

NOTES
    The /dev/urandom is an ("unlocked" random source) which reuses the
    internal pool to produce more pseudo-random bits. Since this is the
    case, the read may contain less entropy than its counterpart
    /dev/random. Knowing this, this module was intended to be used as a
    pseudorandom string generator for less secure applications where
    response timing may be an issue.
