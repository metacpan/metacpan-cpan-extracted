DESCRIPTION

    MooX::Options::Actions is a set of packages designed to make setting up
    and creating command line applications really easy. It automatically
    imports Moo, MooX::Options, namespace::clean, and a "new_with_actions"
    in MooX::Options::Actions::Builder function to set up the top level
    commands. this means you only need to include this one module, and then
    you can set up options as from MooX::Options, and set up commands to
    act on those options by creating subroutines with the cmd_ prefix.
