=head1 SYNOPSIS

To install this module type the following:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test

The exact location of where Math::SparseMatrix will be installed depends
on your system configuration.

If you do not have authority to write into system directories, you can
install Math::SparseMatrix in a local directory that you own and have 
permissions to read and write into as follows:

    perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/YOUR/DIR

if this directory was not already included.
