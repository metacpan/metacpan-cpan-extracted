=head1 SYNOPSIS

 testontap
    [ --_help ]
    [
    	{
    		--_pp
    			|
    		--_pp_script <filepath>

    ]

=head1 OPTIONS AND ARGUMENTS

All options can be abbreviated, as long as they are unambiguous. Option matching is case
sensitive. Forcibly end option parsing using '--'.

=head2

This documents some 'hidden' flags, generally because they're somewhat particular and/or
not ready for prime time...

=item B<--_help>

Displays usage and help with options/arguments. If given, nothing else will be done.

=item B<--_pp> or B<--_pp_script E<lt>pathE<gt>>

Will attempt to generate a binary using the 'pp' command from PAR::Packer.
The binary gets a default name of 'testontap-E<lt>versionE<gt>-E<lt>osE<gt>-E<lt>archE<gt>'.

An existing file will not be overwritten.

By using the C<--verbose> flag, pp verbosity can be raised.

If you need to customize the creation of the binary, use the C<--_pp_script> option to generate a Perl
script. Changing the output file name can easiest be done by using '--outfile E<lt>fileE<gt>', but
for more advanced purposes, edit the script directly. The script should be run immediately after
generation, i.e. before any config changes are made to the Perl installation, and not saved after that.
 
When a packed binary is run, any C<PERL5LIB> envvar is just dropped due to how PAR::Packer works, but if you find it
is needed when running the tests, set the C<TESTONTAP_PERL5LIB> to the desired value and the C<PERL5LIB> variable
will be set with that value during the running of the tests.  

Note that these options can not be used when you already run a binary.

=item B<--_pp_info>

Prints information about the context when the binary was built - the configuration (perl -V), the modules
available (according to L<ExtUtils::Installed>) and the command line used for the C<pp> command.

This information is embedded at the time of packing and read from those files.  

Note that this option can only be used when you run a binary.

=item B<--_ignore_dependencies>

This will turn off the dependencies mechanism between tests - only use for debugging/testing of testontap itself.
