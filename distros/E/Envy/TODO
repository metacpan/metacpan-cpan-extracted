** TODO

per user cache of envies

switch perl PERL5PREFIX to PERL_MM_OPT?

explicit dependencies for refcnt>1 ?

include package   # always reload; no dimensions?

support for dimension migration (dimension aliases)?

real lexical analysis -- use XS?

improve catalogue

machine generate shell script variants (see Rc)
  deprecate csh?
  keeps sh/csh in sync, less chance of bugs
  make compatible with rc/es!

regression tests
  dimension swapping
  top-level switching
  Envy::UI

comparison operations -
  against the same envy symbolic name
    or against two different
  diff similarly named env files - shadowed report

pipe long output through $ENV{PAGER}?
  can't fix envy.pl because shell will eval STDOUT!

umask 0;  # Figure out how to run setuid 'envy'?

  Envy::DB API

This afternoon I started prototyping some stuff for a graphical envy
module picker/cshrc creator. (Not sure whether I want to use the
dotfile generator or not.) I'm using perl-TK, so can directly use the
Envy::DB routines.

What I'm finding I need is the tree stuff we talked about
before. Basically I need to be able to query the DB to find dimensions
that are NOT loaded. (Dimensions that are loaded could maybe be
obtained from the ENVY_STATE and ENVY_DIMENSION environment
variables. I also need to query for children. Now most of this would
be more parsing of the .env files correct? I don't see where you
actually save the dimensions etc of files that aren't loaded. Any
thing you want me to keep in mind as I work on this? I'm thinking
it'll be a generic query subroutine in the DB.IN and some stuff in
envy.pl to add a 'envy.pl tree' command.

Gack!  You're right!  What a mess!  :-)

---------------------------------------------- PIE IN THE SKY! ---

store ENVY_STATE, etc, compressed?!

envy.pl
  show loaded dimensions in PROMPT?
&
  in the 'envy list' the marker is always 'x'
    make the marker dependent on where the file was loaded?

macro-ize notation?
  unshift(VAR, ' ', COMPONENTS)
  push(VAR, ' ', COMPONENTS)

Implement BSD make's "?=" variable assignment operator.  The variable
is assigned the specified value only if that variable is not already
defined.  Unload must be eager.  Does anyone want this?

split/join of _any_ very long variable?
