ABSTRACT

    Test Automation, Docs Generation

SYNOPSIS

      #!/usr/bin/env perl
    
      use Test::Auto;
      use Test::More;
    
      my $test = Test::Auto->new(
        't/Test_Auto.t'
      );
    
      # automation
    
      # my $subtests = $test->subtests->standard;
    
      # ...
    
      # done_testing;

DESCRIPTION

    This package aims to provide, a standard for documenting Perl 5
    software projects, a framework writing tests, test automation, and
    documentation generation.

REASONING

    This framework lets you write documentation in test files using
    pod-like comment blocks. By using a particular set of comment blocks
    (the specification) this framework can run certain kinds of tests
    automatically. For example, we can automatically ensure that the
    package the test is associated with is loadable, that the test file
    comment blocks meet the specification, that any super-classes or
    libraries are loadable, and that the functions, methods, and routines
    are properly documented.

LIBRARIES

    This package uses type constraints from:

    Test::Auto::Types

SCENARIOS

    This package supports the following scenarios:

 exports

      use Test::Auto;
      use Test::More;
    
      my $subtests = testauto 't/Test_Auto.t';
    
      # automation
    
      # $subtests->standard;
    
      # ...
    
      # done_testing;

    This package automatically exports the testauto function which uses the
    "current file" as the automated testing source.

ATTRIBUTES

    This package has the following attributes:

 data

      data(Data)

    This attribute is read-only, accepts (Data) values, and is optional.

 file

      file(Str)

    This attribute is read-only, accepts (Str) values, and is required.

FUNCTIONS

    This package implements the following functions:

 testauto

      testauto(Str $file) : Subtests

    This function is exported automatically and returns a
    Test::Auto::Subtests object for the test file given.

    declarations. It is used by the parser to provide the content used in
    the test automation and document generation.

 name

      =name
    
      Path::Find
    
      =cut

    The name block should contain the package name. This is tested for
    loadability.

 abstract

      =abstract
    
      Find Paths using Heuristics
    
      =cut

    The abstract block should contain a subtitle describing the package.
    This is tested for existence.

 includes

      =includes
    
      function: path
      method: children
      method: siblings
      method: new
    
      =cut

    The includes block should contain a list of function, method, and/or
    routine names in the format of $type: $name. Empty lines are ignored.
    This is tested for existence. Each function, method, and/or routine is
    tested to be documented properly. Also, the package must recognize that
    each exists.

 synopsis

      =synopsis
    
      use Path::Find 'path';
    
      my $path = path; # get path using cwd
    
      =cut

    The synopsis block should contain the normative usage of the package.
    This is tested for existence. This block should be written in a way
    that allows it to be evaled successfully and should return a value.

 description

      =description
    
      interdum posuere lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipiscing elit duis
      tristique sollicitudin nibh sit amet
    
      =cut

    The description block should contain a thorough explanation of the
    purpose of the package. This is tested for existence.

 libraries

      =libraries
    
      Types::Standard
      Types::TypeTiny
    
      =cut

    The libraries block should contain a list of packages, each of which is
    itself a Type::Library. These packages are tested for loadability, and
    to ensure they are type library classes.

 inherits

      =inherits
    
      Path::Tiny
    
      =cut

    The inherits block should contain a list of parent packages. These
    packages are tested for loadability.

      =integrates
    
      Path::Find::Upable
      Path::Find::Downable
    
      =cut

    The integrates block should contain a list of packages that are
    involved in the behavior of the main package. These packages are not
    automatically tested.

 scenarios

      =scenario export-path-make
    
      quisque egestas diam in arcu cursus euismod quis viverra nibh
    
      =example export-path-make
    
      # given: synopsis
    
      package main;
    
      use Path::Find 'path_make';
    
      path_make 'relpath/to/file';
    
      =cut

    There are situation where a package can be configured in different
    ways, especially where it exists without functions, methods or routines
    for the purpose of configuring the environment. The scenario directive
    can be used to automate testing and documenting package usages and
    configurations.Describing a scenario requires two blocks, i.e. scenario
    $name and example $name. The scenario block should contain a
    description of the scenario and its purpose. The example block must
    exist when documenting a method and should contain valid Perl code and
    return a value. The block may contain a "magic" comment in the form of
    given: synopsis or given: example-$number $name which if present will
    include the given code example(s) with the evaluation of the current
    block. Each scenario is tested and must be recognized to exist by the
    main package.

 attributes

      =attributes
    
      cwd: ro, req, Object
    
      =cut

    The attributes block should contain a list of package attributes in the
    form of $name: $is, $presence, $type, where $is should be ro
    (read-only) or rw (read-wire), and $presence should be req (required)
    or opt (optional), and $type can be any valid Type::Tiny expression.
    Each attribute declaration must be recognized to exist by the main
    package and have a type which is recognized by one of the declared type
    libraries.

 methods

      =method children
    
      quis viverra nibh cras pulvinar mattis nunc sed blandit libero volutpat
    
      =signature children
    
      children() : [Object]
    
      =example-1 children
    
      # given: synopsis
    
      my $children = $path->children;
    
      =example-2 children
    
      # given: synopsis
    
      my $filtered = $path->children(qr/lib/);
    
      =cut

    Describing a method requires at least three blocks, i.e. method $name,
    signature $name, and example-1 $name. The method block should contain a
    description of the method and its purpose. The signature block should
    contain a method signature in the form of $signature : $return_type,
    where $signature is a valid typed signature and $return_type is any
    valid Type::Tiny expression. The example-$number block is a repeatable
    block, and at least one block must exist when documenting a method. The
    example-$number block should contain valid Perl code and return a
    value. The block may contain a "magic" comment in the form of given:
    synopsis or given: example-$number $name which if present will include
    the given code example(s) with the evaluation of the current block.
    Each method is tested and must be recognized to exist by the main
    package.

 functions

      =function path
    
      lectus quam id leo in vitae turpis massa sed elementum tempus egestas
    
      =signature children
    
      path() : Object
    
      =example-1 path
    
      package Test::Path::Find;
    
      use Path::Find;
    
      my $path = path;
    
      =cut

    Describing a function requires at least three blocks, i.e. function
    $name, signature $name, and example-1 $name. The function block should
    contain a description of the function and its purpose. The signature
    block should contain a function signature in the form of $signature :
    $return_type, where $signature is a valid typed signature and
    $return_type is any valid Type::Tiny expression. The example-$number
    block is a repeatable block, and at least one block must exist when
    documenting a function. The example-$number block should contain valid
    Perl code and return a value. The block may contain a "magic" comment
    in the form of given: synopsis or given: example-$number $name which if
    present will include the given code example(s) with the evaluation of
    the current block. Each function is tested and must be recognized to
    exist by the main package.

 routines

      =routine algorithms
    
      sed sed risus pretium quam vulputate dignissim suspendisse in est ante
    
      =signature algorithms
    
      algorithms() : Object
    
      =example-1 algorithms
    
      # given: synopsis
    
      $path->algorithms
    
      =example-2 algorithms
    
      package Test::Path::Find;
    
      use Path::Find;
    
      Path::Find->algorithms;
    
      =cut

    Typically, a Perl subroutine is declared as a function or a method.
    Rarely, but sometimes necessary, you will need to describe a subroutine
    where the invocant is either a class or class instance. Describing a
    routine requires at least three blocks, i.e. routine $name, signature
    $name, and example-1 $name. The routine block should contain a
    description of the routine and its purpose. The signature block should
    contain a routine signature in the form of $signature : $return_type,
    where $signature is a valid typed signature and $return_type is any
    valid Type::Tiny expression. The example-$number block is a repeatable
    block, and at least one block must exist when documenting a routine.
    The example-$number block should contain valid Perl code and return a
    value. The block may contain a "magic" comment in the form of given:
    synopsis or given: example-$number $name which if present will include
    the given code example(s) with the evaluation of the current block.
    Each routine is tested and must be recognized to exist by the main
    package.

 types

      =type Path
    
        Path
    
      =type-parent Path
    
        Object
    
      =type-library Path
    
      Path::Types
    
      =type-composite Path
    
        InstanceOf["Path::Find"]
    
      =type-coercion-1 Path
    
        # can coerce from Str
    
        './path/to/file'
    
      =type-example-1 Path
    
        require Path::Find;
    
        Path::Find::path('./path/to/file')
    
      =cut

    When developing Perl programs, or type libraries, that use Type::Tiny
    based type constraints, testing and documenting custom type constraints
    is often overlooked. Describing a custom type constraint requires at
    least two blocks, i.e. type $name and type-library $name. While it's
    not strictly required, it's a good idea to also include at least one
    type-example-1 $name. The optional type-parent block should contain the
    name of the parent type. The type-composite block should contain a type
    expression that represents the derived type. The type-coercion-$number
    block is a repeatable block which is used to validate type coercion.
    The type-coercion-$number block should contain valid Perl code and
    return the value to be coerced. The type-example-$number block is a
    repeatable block, and it's a good idea to have at least one block must
    exist when documenting a type. The type-example-$number block should
    contain valid Perl code and return a value. Each type is tested and
    must be recognized to exist within the package specified by the
    type-library block.

AUTOMATION

      $test->standard;

    This is the equivalent of writing:

      $test->package;
      $test->document;
      $test->libraries;
      $test->inherits;
      $test->attributes;
      $test->methods;
      $test->routines;
      $test->functions;
      $test->types;

    This framework provides a set of automated subtests based on the
    package specification, but not everything can be automated so it also
    provides you with two powerful hooks into the framework for manual
    testing.

      my $subtests = $test->subtests;
    
      $subtests->synopsis(fun($tryable) {
        ok my $result = $tryable->result, 'result ok';
    
        $result; # for automated testing after the callback
      });

    The code examples documented can be automatically evaluated (evaled)
    and returned using a callback you provide for further testing. Because
    the code examples are returned as Data::Object::Try objects, this makes
    capturing and testing exceptions simple, for example:

      my $subtests = $test->subtests;
    
      $subtests->synopsis(fun($tryable) {
        # synopsis throws an exception
        $tryable->catch('Path::Find::Error', sub {
          return $_[0];
        });
        ok my $result = $tryable->result, 'result ok';
        ok $result->isa('Path::Find::Error'), 'exception caught';
    
        $result;
      });

    Finally, The other manual testing hook (with some automation) is the
    example method. This hook evaluates (evals) a given example and returns
    the result as a Data::Object::Try object.

      my $subtests = $test->subtests;
    
      $subtests->example(-1, 'children', 'method', fun($tryable) {
        ok my $result = $tryable->result, 'result ok';
    
        $result;
      });

    The test automation and document generation enabled through this
    framework makes it easy to maintain source/test/documentation parity.
    This also increases reusability and reduces the need for complicated
    state and test setup.
