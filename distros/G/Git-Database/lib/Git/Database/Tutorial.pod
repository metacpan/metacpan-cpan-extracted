=head1 GLOSSARY

=over 4

=item repository

The local Git repository, as managed by B<git>.

=item backend

A class doing the L<Git::Database::Role::Backend> role.
The L<Git::Database> module acts as a frontend that returns a backend
object.

It manages all interactions with the Git repository, via its L<store>.
A backend instance is always connected to a store instance.

The backend interface is split across several roles, each
requiring one or more access methods to be defined. The
roles are: L<Git::Database::Role::Backend> (this is
the minimum required role that a class must do to be
considered a backend), L<Git::Database::Role::ObjectReader>,
L<Git::Database::Role::ObjectWriter>, L<Git::Database::Role::RefReader>
and L<Git::Database::Role::RefWriter>.

L<Git::Database::Backend::None> is a special backend class
that is not connected to a store. The only supported method is
L<hash_object|Git::Database::Role::Backend/hash_object>.

=item store

The Perl Git wrapper that reads and write the data from and to the repository.

A store instance is always connected to an actual Git repository.

The backend class is named after the store class. For example,
the backend class for L<Git::Repository> stores is named
L<Git::Database::Backend::Git::Repository>.

The currently supported stores are (by order of appearance):
L<Git::Repository>, L<Git::Sub>, L<Git::PurePerl>, L<Cogit>, L<Git>,
L<Git::Wrapper>, and L<Git::Raw::Repository>.
If you know of other Git wrappers, please let me know or submit patches.
Thanks!

The following one-liner will list which stores are currently installed:

    perl -MGit::Database -E 'say for Git::Database->available_stores'

=item object

An object from the Git object database. Represented in Perl by the
L<Git::Database::Object::Blob>, L<Git::Database::Object::Tree>,
L<Git::Database::Object::Commit> and L<Git::Database::Object::Tag>
classes.

=item ref

A reference (tag or branch) in the Git repository.

=head1 HOW TO

=head2 Obtain a Git::Database object from an existing repository

The L<Git::Database> module is really a simple factory class that returns
L</backend> objects. The actual backend class depends on the Git wrapper
module used to access the Git repository.

The generic way is:

    # $r is an instance of some Perl Git wrapper
    my $db = Git::Database->new( store => $r );

For example, if C<$r> is a L<Git::Repository> object, C<$db> is going
to be a L<Git::Database::Backend::Git::Repository> object.

Example:

    # use Git::Repository with a repository in the current working directory
    my $db = Git::Database->new( store => Git::Repository->new );

    $db->isa('Git::Database::Backend::Git::Repository');    # true

L<Git::Sub> is a special backend, as it's the only one that does not
provide an object-oriented interface. When given a L</store> that does
not the L<Git::Database::Role::Backend> role, L<Git::Database> assumes
it's a directory name, and creates a L<Git::Database::Backend::Git::Sub>
object to handle it.

For the moment, there is no way to perform an "automatic selection"
of the backend based on what's available.

=head2 Create a new repository using Git::Database

This is outside of the realm of L<Git::Database>, since it must be handed
an existing L</store> object.

The L<Git::Repository::Tutorial> documentation has detailed examples
of how to L<create|Git::Repository::Tutorial/"Create a new repository">
or L<clone|Git::Repository::Tutorial/"Clone a repository"> a new repository.

Other Git wrappers may also be able to create new repositories.

The resulting object can then be passed to C<< Git::Database->new >>
as the C<store> attribute.

=head2 Create a Git object

There are two ways to create a Git object (doing the
L<Git::Database::Role::Object> role), with subtle differences between them.

=item using the class directly

    my $blob = Git::Database::Object::Blob->new( content => "Hello, world!" );
    $blob->isa("Git::Database::Object::Blob");    # true
    $blob->has_backend;                           # false
    $blob->digest;    # use hash_object() from Git::Database::Backend::None
    $blob->has_backend;                           # true
    $blob->backend->isa("Git::Database::Backend::None");

=item using the backend

    my $blob = $backend->create_object( kind => 'blob',  content => "Hello, world!" );
    $blob->isa("Git::Database::Object::Blob");    # true
    $blob->has_backend;                           # true
    $blob->digest;    # use hash_object() from $backend (might be faster)
    $blob->backend->isa( ref $backend );

=back

When no backend is provided, a default L<Git::Database::Backend::None> is
created as needed. Its L<hash_object|Git::Database::Role::Backend/hash_object>
method is the default implementation provided by L<Git::Database::Role::Backend>.
