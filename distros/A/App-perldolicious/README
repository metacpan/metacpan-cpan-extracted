NAME
    perldolicious - Mojolicious::Lite webapp that lets you search (with
    regexp) and display CPAN modules documentation

VERSION
    Version 0.011.

SYNOPSIS
      perldolicious daemon
      # now point your web browser to the address http://localhost:3000/

      # or use a different port
      perldolicious daemon -l http://localhost:8000

      # or use the Mojolicious' builtin webserver morbo (assuming
      # perldolicious is installed in /usr/local/bin)
      morbo /usr/local/bin/perldolicious

DESCRIPTION
  FEATURES
    *   Search CPAN modules with regular expressions.

    *   Modules that you wish to see its documentation don't have to be
        installed on your system. Since perldolicious uses Pod::Cpandoc
        under the hood.

    *   Pretty fast, since it stores the modules list cache in Storable
        format.

    *   Gradient-free, no-nonsense webpage. Although it'll cheerfully blink
        when necessary (it's all about priorities).

CONFIGURATIONS
    You can configure the behavior of perldolicious by writing configuration
    file, stored at ~/.perldolicious/config.json (written in JSON format).
    Here are the recognized options:

    *   modules_cache_file. Specify different location to store the modules
        list cache file. Defaults to ~/.perldolicious/modules.storable.

    *   auto_download. Delete "modules_cache_file" and generate a new one by
        downloading the cpan package file 02packages.details.txt.gz if it's
        older than the specified number (in days). Default is set to 14 (two
        weeks).

    *   quiet. Send the server log to the file ~/.perldolicious/server.log
        instead of to "STDERR". Default: false.

    Example:

      $ cat ~/.perldolicious/config.json
      {
          "quiet": 1,
          "auto_download": 5,
          "modules_cache_file": "/Users/Syaltut/.modules"
      }

LIMITATIONS
    *   No pagination - which means you shouldn't use patterns like ".*" if
        you don't want your browser to eat up all of your computer's memory.

SEE ALSO
    *   Mojolicious

    *   Pod::Cpandoc
