Cvs-Simple version 0.06
=======================

Cvs::Simple is an attempt to provide an easy-to-use wrapper that allows cvs
commands to be executed from within a Perl program, without the programmer
having to wade through the (many) cvs global and command-specific options.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

You will be prompted for the path to your cvs binary (/usr/bin/cvs on most
Unix-like systems), and for any value you wish to set for CVSROOT , i.e C<cvs -d>, e.g.
C<:ext:user@cvs.remoterepo.tld:/path/to/repo> (you can leave this blank if you
have set CVSROOT in you environment, or you have C<cvs -d> in your C<.cvsrc>.

See C<man cvs> for more on C<cvs -d>, C<CVSROOT> and C<.cvsrc>.
