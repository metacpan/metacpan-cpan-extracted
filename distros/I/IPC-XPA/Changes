0.10	2011-03-29T09:59:32-04:00

        - Fix inappropriate freeing of memory if no servers responded
          to XPANSLookup

0.09	2009-11-10T13:15:25-05:00
        - fix licensing; was a mix of GPL2 & Perl, now is pure GPL3

0.08_01	2008-01-18T14:59:47-05:00
        - remove nuisance GNUMakefile
        - add primitive support for pkg-config for xpa

0.08	2002-09-25T21:40:06+00:00
        - the buf argument to Set may be a scalar ref
          as well as a scalar

0.07	2002-04-12T20:55:19+00:00

        - code + doc cleanups.

0.06	2002-01-29T14:59:41+00:00
        - upgraded to XPA 2.1.0b8.
        - NSLookup and Access had API changes.
        - Handle Access error message against old servers

0.05	2000-09-09T01:00:48+00:00
        - missing typemap cast caused warnings from gcc

        - removed AUTOLOAD stuff; not needed

0.04	2000-08-02T16:23:42+00:00
        - revamped returns from _Set() and _Get(); these now return
          a hash keyed off of the server name (as returned by XPA),
          with values being hashes with the returned results.
          previously it returned an array of the hashes with returned
          results.  THIS IS A MAJOR API CHANGE and WILL BREAK CODE.

        - the XPA handle had been blessed into IPC::XPA, but the
          IPC::XPA::DESTROY routine was set up to handle what
          IPC::XPA::new created, namely a hash, not a scalar.  Thus,
          when Perl cleanup was going on, it called DESTROY on the
          scalar, causing it to burp.  To solve this, the XPA handle is
          now in it's own class, IPC::XPA::RAW.

        - test script set max_servers to -1 when no servers were
          there, causing _Get to try to allocate that many things.

        - added check for version of ds9; older versions apparantly
          don't do array correctly.  really shouldn't be using ds9 for
          testing!

0.03	2000-07-05T15:35:59+00:00
        - nullXPA() was was returning something which caused
          the XS routines to complain about undef'd values.  it was
          moved into XS land, and a more sophisticated (kludgy?)
          thing was done to check for undef and mapping it correctly
          to NULL.

0.02	2000-05-09T20:59:31+00:00
        - fixed test script to work if more than one server is running

0.01	2000-05-04T01:46:05+00:00
        - original version; created by h2xs 1.18
