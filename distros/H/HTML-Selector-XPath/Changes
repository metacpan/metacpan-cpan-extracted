Revision history for Perl extension HTML::Selector::XPath

0.26 NEXT

0.25 2018-11-03
    * Add support for compiling :disabled, :selected, :checked, :text,
      :last-of-type

      I'm not sure whether the Perl XPath libaries support this, but at least
      we can compile it.

      This addresses RT #124406, thanks to Andrew Maguire

    * Test stability improvement if HTML::TreeBuilder::XPath is not installed
    * Re-release with properly fixed META.* information
      (RT 127555, reported by Dan Book)
    * No code changes, no need to upgrade

0.23 2017-03-23 (Thu Mar 23 19:35:00 GMT+1 2017)
    * seems as if "provides" in META.json makes new versions not get indexed
      properly
    * No code changes, no need to upgrade
    * We also allow static installation now, without running Makefile.PL

      - Add CSS3 ":first-of-type" and ":nth-of-type()" pseudo-attributes (Corion)
