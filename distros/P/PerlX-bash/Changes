    * Can now "pipe" `bash` output through a Perl sub.
    * Passed in qr// args are quoted just like filenames.

    [Bug Fixes]
    * Combining capture and `-e` now works as expected.
    * Now get useful error message if you don't pass `bash` any args.
    * Ditto if you pass `bash` only capture and/or switch args.
    * Ditto if you pass `bash` any args which are not defined.
      (And no extra warning if it's the _first_ arg which is undef.)

    * Force locale to 'C' when unit testing error messages.
