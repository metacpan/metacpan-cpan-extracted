   - updating rules/spamcop_uri.cf with latest scores, exclusions, etc.


0.23  Sun Mar  6 01:04:46 PST 2005
   - updated diffs against SA 2.63 and 2.64
   - fixing regex for port stripping of urls
   - fixing configuration for xrl.us / openredirect

0.22 Thu Aug  5 13:09:15 PDT 2004
   - Updated Makefile.pl to support 2.64 and including
     PerMsgStatus.pm from 2.64 release.  Install
     process now figures out what version you have
     and installs correct patched version of PerMsgStatus.pm.

0.21 Wed Aug  4 16:41:31 PDT 2004
   - Defaulting config param spamcop_uri_limit to 20.  If
     the number of URLs in a message exceeds the limit, they
     are shuffled and only up to the number specified for the limit
     are tested.  

   - New syntax for specifying the address match for multi.surbl.org:
     Instead of '127.0.0.0/2' use '127.0.0.0+2' this is being
     done to eliminate any confusion with CIDR syntax.
     The old '/' syntax is still supported, but will be deprecated
     in a future version.

0.20 Sat Jul 31 22:02:20 PDT 2004
  - adding max url config param to limit number of URLs checked 
    in an email.  Usage (place into .cf file):
      spamcop_uri_limit 50
    Default is unlimited.
  
  - adding support for multi.surbl.org / bitmasked results.  
    query results are cached on a per msg basis to prevent additional
    lookups.

    Modify your configuration to look like the following for sc.surbl.org:

     uri SPAMCOP_URI_RBL           eval:check_spamcop_uri_rbl('multi.surbl.org','127.0.0.0/2')
     describe SPAMCOP_URI_RBL      URI's domain appears in spamcop database at sc.surbl.org
     tflags SPAMCOP_URI_RBL	net
     score SPAMCOP_URI_RBL  3.0

    ws.surbl.org would look like this:

      uri WS_URI_RBL           eval:check_spamcop_uri_rbl('multi.surbl.org','127.0.0.0/4')
      describe WS_URI_RBL      URI's domain appears in ws database at ws.surbl.org
      tflags WS_URI_RBL       net
      score WS_URI_RBL  2.0

  - Removed configuration params: spamcop_uri_src 
    and spamcop_uri_path since
    these should never be used anymore.

  - added cleanup for hosts that come in with a dot in front of
    of the host (e.g. http://.spammy-site.org)

0.19 Wed Jul 21 08:56:57 PDT 2004
   - fix for hex-encoded urls that have a port
   - skipping open_redirect tests until reliable open_redirector is found

0.18 Wed May 26 13:41:14 PDT 2004
   - fixed pack template for de-base 10 to use network byte
     order.  This release is only needed by users
     with big endian machines.


0.17 Mon May 24 18:23:55 PDT 2004
    - added code to handle hex encoded and base 10 encoded 
      IP addresses
    - added backslash handling in urls (http:/\www.google.com)
    - handling case when host of a URL is a '.'
    - calling env_proxy on LWP::UserAgent to support proxied
      users

0.16 Sat May 15 00:58:05 PDT 2004
    - modified extract to catch AOL redirs
    - fixed handling of IP's in URLs when normalization occurs
    - adding env_proxy to LWP stuff so proxies work 
      (thanks to bluebanana at users.sourceforge.net)

0.15 Thu May  6 22:18:17 PDT 2004
    - making Makefile.PL install intelligently
    - added url extraction that should take care of rd.yahoo.com, 
      g.msn.com, ads.msn.com, google.com, etc. 
      Basically pulls urls out of paths and query strings.
    - removed *.msn.com, *.yahoo.com and *.google.com from
      open_redirect list since url extraction should handle
      this
    - added snurl.com to open_redirect_list_spamcop_uri
    - added host cleanup for www=2eseo500=2ecom -> www.seo500.com
    - making URI >= 1.28 PREREQ instead of 0


0.14 Thu Apr 22 17:57:11 PDT 2004
    - fixing empty host in url case 'http://'


0.13 Thu Apr 22 17:14:11 PDT 2004
    - fix method call to work with 5.005
    - only doing one query per host instead of both 2nd and 3rd level 
      stripping the host down to the registrar domain using SA code 
      from Util.pm and http://www.bestregistrar.com/help/ccTLD.htm
    - added query caching to reduce queries even more


0.12 Wed Apr 21 07:34:28 PDT 2004
    - fix to open_redirect test

0.11 Tue Apr 20 20:37:04 PDT 2004
    - major refactor - removed all deprecated tests
      that depended on local cache of data 
      see upgrade section about cleaning up your local install
      in the INSTALL doc
    - adding open redirect resolution that will
      attempt to resolve the Location header for 
      hosts that appear in the open_redirect_list_spamcop_uri.
      this should take care of spammers hiding behind
      rd.yahoo.com or snipurl.com. this is off 
      by default and requires enabling it with 
      spamcop_uri_resolve_open_redirects 1
    - fixed local whitelisting and blacklisting
    - sanitizing host portion of the URL by stripping
      non alpha characters from the TLD 
    - added more info in the INSTALL section
      to help with installation issues
    - removed spamcopuri-update
    - fixed prereqs in Makefile.PL 

0.10 Tue Apr 13 14:56:37 PDT 2004
    - fixing dnsrbl test...again
    - removing erroneous test from spamcop_fetch

0.09 Thu Apr  8 07:36:33 PDT 2004
    - fixing dnsrbl test
    - commenting out local tests and adjusting score for
      RBL test to 3.0

0.08 Thu Apr  1 09:04:43 PST 2004
     - adding check_spamcop_uri_rbl() method that 
       allows checking of uri's domain against DNS based
       RBL list.  This checks the 2nd and 3rd level domains
       of the URI.

0.07 Sat Mar 13 15:19:56 PST 2004
     - using URI instead of URI::URL internally
     - got rid of check_spamcop_host_uri() in favor of 
       generic method that takes fields as args
     - place spamcop_uri_src in to Conf.pm so we can
       define src in one place without having to passing it in
       as a arg to the tests

0.06 Thu Mar 11 07:53:29 PST 2004
     - putting  scheme back in local database data structure
     - adding more debugging around storing urls
     - allowing spamcop_url to be defined in conf
     - adding EXE_FILES section to Makefile.pm

0.05 Sun Mar  7 04:34:57 PST 2004
     - no longer using freeapp.net / fetching urls from spamcop.net directly
     - locally caching urls in __userstate__/spamcop_uri using Storable
       expiring URLs older than 4 days (configured via symbol table entry - URL_TIMEOUT)
       checking for new data after CACHE_TIMEOUT currently 10 minutes

0.04 Sun Feb 29 14:05:39 PST 2004
    - now caching queries for 60 seconds by hostname
    - blacklist and whitelisting by hostname is now possible in .cf
    - simplified configuration, URL_HOME can be specified in eval: rule
    - using new hashed directory structure instead of searching 
      against the cgi (http://spamcheck.freeapp.net/domains/)
    - including test suite
    - using SA core debugging instead of STDERR
    - displaying useful message in SUMMARY information
      in email when hits occur 
      (e.g. "http://193.27.84.78/link48r.php?site=x&file=fs2 is blacklisted
             in http://spamcheck.freeapp.net/domains");

0.03 Thu Feb 26 09:20:02 PST 2004
    - adding allowed_scheme hash to check_spamcop method
      to restrict urls to http, https, and ftp
      need to come up with more general way for other schemes

0.02 Mon Feb 23 17:10:19 PST 2004
    - updating URL_HOME to http://spamcheck.freeapp.net/search-uri.cgi

0.01 Tue Feb 17 22:45:48 PST 2004
    - Initial spamcop check in
    - spamcop uri tests against server
