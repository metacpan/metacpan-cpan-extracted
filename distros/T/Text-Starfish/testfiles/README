NEEDS RENAMING AND DOC UPDATES:
6 - using -o option, very similar to 10-tex (6.in 6.out) TeX style
8 - test of some functions getmakefilelist (8.in 8.out) default style
9 - working with macros, with -o option (9_java.in 9_java.out)
30 - testing with Loops, HTML style, collecting ToC (30.html.sfish
     30_html.out)
ok 21 - testing HideMacros with 9_java.out to 10_java.out
ok 22 - testing 10_java.out(10.java) to 11_java.out
ok 23 - (Skip under Windows) testing -mode= option

13,14,15 - testing some macros //m!newdefe

16 - testing .tex file (tex style, after init config)

19,20 - testing html -> html, file permissions: if the output file is
    specified and mode is not given, it should not be changed.

21 - HTML example 2
22 - HTML example 3

25 - Makefile example

26 - testing include

33 - testing sfish_add_tag in LaTeX
