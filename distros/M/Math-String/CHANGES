 * Fix case in Math::String when bzero() is called as a class method.

 * Required version of Math::BigInt is now 1.999802 (was 1.87).

 * Remove Math::BigFloat from requirements in Makefile.PL, since it is bundled
   together with Math::BigInt.

 * Trim whitespace.

 * POD nits (CPAN RT #51833).

 * Fix hash randomization issues (CPAN RT #95621).

 * POD formatting and typos.

 * The NEW file now refers to the CHANGES file.

 * Revert to ExtUtils::MakeMaker since use Module::Install is discouraged.
   Change license from "gpl" to "gpl_3", since "gpl" is not a valid option for
   the license.

 * Switch from Test to Test::More in t/stringpm.t for better testing
   functionality and easier debugging.

 * Fix flawed tests.

2008-04-03 1.28 Tels 662 tests

 * do not use "lib => GMP", instead let the user decide which lib we take

 * bundle Module::Install and amend Makefile.PL

 * require Math::BigInt v1.87

2001-03-18 1.07: fixed: documentation
2001-03-25 1.08: added: support for caching of string form

2001-07-26 1.13: new( { str => 'abc', num => '123' } );
2001-08-08 1.14: bstr() was not caching string form, some more tests
	         copy() does no longer make a (costly) true copy of the charset
2001-09-01 1.15: unreleased
		 binc(), bdec() modify cache for speedup (instead clearing it)
                 added bone(), is_valid(), maxlen(), minlen()
2001-11-05 1.16: added class()
		 binc(), bdec() modify cache instead of clearing it (speedup)
		 added bone(), is_valid(), minlen(), maxlen(), type(), class()
2002-02-20 1.17: removed debug output

2003-07-26 1.23: removed shebang line
2003-12-11 1.24 Tels 599 tests
  * new( { str => ..., num => ... } ) did not honour scale from charset
2004-11-20 1.25 Tels 662 tests
  * simplify caching:
    + remove unused len cache
    + since we only cache on thing, use a plain scalar instead of a hash, this
      saves memory per Math::String object and makes everything go a little
      faster since a hash lookup for ->{str} is no longer necessary
  * bstr() for uncached strings with SIMPLE charset is now about twice as fast
  * copy() is about 16% faster (due to simpler cache and streamlining)
2004-11-20 1.26 Tels 662 tests
  * avoid caching wrong $CALC - load GMP rightaway
2005-01-01 1.27 Tels 662 tests
  * use register_callback to get notified by Math::BigInt on lib changes

Math::String::Charset:

2000-02-07 1.02: first version with bi-grams
2000-02-14 1.03: fixed: simple charsets to work now,
                 added: _end hash and _ones set
2000-02-16 1.04: added: char(), charlength()
2000-02-17 1.05: fixed: chars with diff. len raise error, works now with
                        characters of length > 1
                        some slight optimizations for simple charsets
2000-02-22 1.06: fixed: documentation (fill-characters, die on error)
			toggle $Math::String::Charset::die_on_error
		        num2str() is now about a small, constant amount faster
2000-03-18 1.07: fixed: documentation
		 added: separator string/char for 'the lazy fox' style strings
		 	renamed type() to order()
		 	documented that length() always returns count of chars
2000-03-25 1.08: added: next(), prev() for simple charsets (cache in M::S)
2000-06-26 1.09: fixed: bug accessing BigInt's internals, fails for BitVect etc
2000-09-01 1.10: split: into Charset, Nested and Grouped
                 fixed: next()/prev() work now
		 added: support for minlen, maxlen, ones(), type()
2000-10-19 1.11: fixed: Math::BigInt::bzero() => Math::BigInt->bero()
		 split Charset.pm into
			Math::String::Charset::Simple  (type = 0, order = 1)
			Math::String::Charset::Nested  (type = 0, order > 1)
			Math::String::Charset::Grouped (type = 1, order = 1)
	         added: support for minlen and maxlen
	                ones(), count(), zero(), one(), type() and tests
			next/prev actually work
			analyze is alias for study, can export analyze
		fixed:  better error handling upon initialization
  			is now subclassable
			first()/last() work now with sep char, added tests
  			make Math::String->first($length,$set) work
			 (and last(), too), test for it
			study:
			 'chars' and 'start' for depth => 1
			 depth as alias for order
			 can return histogram (hist => 1)
			 now works for the "hocuspocus" example
			 tests are now in seperate file
2003-02-06 1.12: added __END__ marker for faster loading
2003-04-10 1.13: added scale() and scale as parameter to new()
2003-04-22 1.14: fix for scale not beeing a legal parameter to new()
		 prefer Math::BigInt::GMP on use
		 added method copy()
2003-07-26 1.15: require Math::String::Charset::Wordlist vs. use
		 added lib => 'GMP'
		 removed shebang line
2004-11-20 1.16
  * for simple Charsets, the _end hash can be shared with the _map hash. That
    reduces memory by at least 20% (a..z, leaning towards 30% for larger sets)
    and makes new() at least 10% (a..z, more for larger sets) faster, too :)
  * dump() returns the dump as string instead of printing it
  * fix end keys in dump from SIMPLE charsets
  * dump() takes optional indend parameter
  * remove unused SIMPLE() in Charset.pm
  * streamlined str2num() to make "new()" faster
  * streamlined num2str() to make "bstr()" faster
  * remove GMP lib (let caller decide)
