*   Marc-Olivier BERNARD <mob@kilargo.fr> notified of the warnings that
        the library produced while "warnings" pragma enabled and improper
        parsed rgb values that contain single "0". This bug was fixed in 1.2

    *   "Herrmann Martin (FV/FLI) *" <Martin.Herrmann@de.bosch.com> noticed
        a bug in rgb2hex() method which was failing if the blue value was a
        single "0". This problem is fixed in 1.3

hex() method returned undef if the first value returned
from rgb() was 0. Thanks to Marc-Olivier Bernard <mob@kilargo.fr>
for noticing it.

Warnings issued by names() is fixed
(again thanks to Marc-Olivier Bernard mob@kilargo.fr )


hex2rgb() also was issueing warnings, and replacing built-in
hex() with CORE::hex() solve the problem, sine the library itself
has its own hex() method

Some touches to the manual...
