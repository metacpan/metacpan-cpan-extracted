<H1>Introduction to OpenInteract</H1>

<P>
OpenInteract is an apache / mod_perl based application server that
implements database connectivity and security through the SPOPS object
framework.

<P>
SPOPS (Simple Perl Object Persistence with Security) is an object-oriented
application framework that provides object persistency and security
services to your applications.

</UL>
<P>
<H1>Why are we doing this?</H1>
<P>
Almost every web-based application needs to deal with certain issues:

<UL>
<LI><A NAME="item_Authentication">Authentication: How do I know who is viewing a particular page
or making a particular request?</A>
<LI>Security: is this person allowed to make this request?
<LI><A NAME="item_Display">Display: How can I ensure all pages look the same? How can I
make a change in one location and have it percolate down into the
entire site?</A>
<LI>Sessions: how can i track information from request to request?
<LI><A NAME="item_Data">Data: How can I deal with data consistently? How can I add new
types of data to the system easily? How can I relate disparate data
objects?</A>
<LI><A NAME="item_Performance">Performance: How can I minimize database queries as well as
computation needed to create commonly-used graphical elements?</A>
</UL>
<P>
OpenInteract takes care of all these questions, in addition to others. It
is based on open standards and is itself an open source application,
meaning that nothing is hidden from you if you choose to investigate how
something is done. You can even improve how OpenInteract works and
contribute your modifications back to the community which itself will be
improving and adding to the system.

<P>
<H1>What you need to know</H1>

<P>
<STRONG>Level of Knowledge</STRONG>

<P>
If you want to make substantial changes to the system, or add substantial
functionality, you're going to need to know Perl. There's really no way
around this fact. Any reasonably complicated system is going to demand more
from its users, and OpenInteract is no exception.

<P>
That said, developing applications under the OpenInteract framework is
quite simple. You don't need to write code to create SPOPS objects, just
create a configuration entry for it. And many applications are simple
enough that you can use one of the included tools as a template.

<P>
Configuration files are in Perl form, although the setup is quite
intuitive and should be easy to modify.

<P>
<STRONG>It's not ASP/PHP/...</STRONG>

<P>
OpenInteract is built from the ground-up on perl, and it will remain so. We
will not rewrite it in PHP -- although you're free to do so yourself if you
like. Perl has been called the 'duct tape of the Internet' for good reason:
it makes available an astonishing array of possibilities while still
remaining fairly simple. We want OpenInteract to be able to do just about
anything you can do with a web application, while still taking care of most
of the stuff that nobody likes to deal with.

<P>
<STRONG>Creating Templates</STRONG>

<P>
The syntax for using the recommended templating scheme (Template Toolkit)
is quite straightforward, and if you've done any web template programming
you'll probably pick it up within a half-hour, if not sooner. Most
templates that come with the system use only a few constructs, and the
syntax is simple enough to understand quickly yet powerful enough to enable
any number of tasks.

<P>
<H1>How it works (briefly)</H1>
<P>
OpenInteract implements a mod_perl content handler that takes all requests.
It parses the URL and maps it to a module which will generate the content
for the page. (That module can in turn call any number of other modules,
but that's getting into details.)

<P>
The content handler calls separate modules to parse cookies, create a
session to compensate for the stateless http request paradigm, and ensures
that the user is properly authenticated. It passes the module information
to the user interface handler, which calls the module and puts it into the
site template so every page looks the same.

<P>
OpenInteract also handlers errors in a uniform fashion, enables database
connection pooling, and manages user interface elements (colors, fonts and
otherwise) through a web interface.

<P>
<H1>Requirements</H1>
<P>
There are a number of requirements for OpenInteract:

<P>
<STRONG>Perl</STRONG>



<P>
You must have Perl installed on your system, and its version must be
greater than 5.004. (We have run systems for months on 5.005_03 and
5.6.1 with no issues.)

<P>
<STRONG>apache</STRONG>



<P>
You must have apache installed on your system. OpenInteract has been
successfully tested with version 1.3.12.

<P>
<STRONG>mod_perl</STRONG>



<P>
The mod_perl apache module must be installed and successfully working. You
will probably also be able to use PerlEx on Windows NT/2000 machines in the
near future, but this is not yet built.

<P>
The <EM>OpenInteract Administrator's Guide</EM> has some basic instructions for building mod_perl and apache from source,
which is strongly recommended.

<P>
<STRONG>RDBMS</STRONG>



<P>
Currently, OpenInteract works <STRONG>only</STRONG> with a relational database system, also known as a SQL database. It may in
the future be adapted to use BerkeleyDB or an object database, but
currently it's a RDBMS or nothing.

<P>
Don't have such a system? Don't fret! High-quality systems are available
for free. The MySQL database is a very fast, very functional database that
is both free in terms of cost and is open source. MySQL does not support
traditional database constructs such as transactions, stored procedures,
triggers and foreign keys (among others), but it works well with
OpenInteract

<P>
If you use the Linux operating system, you can use either MySQL or a free
version of Sybase Adaptive Server Enterprise. Version 11.0.3.3 has been
made available free of cost for both production and deployment, although
this does not include official support. Sybase ASE requires more
administration, but it is definitely a heavyweight database with likely all
the features you will need.

<P>
<STRONG>DBI</STRONG>



<P>
Perl's Database Interface provides a generic interface to myriad databases;
the SPOPS::DBI data handler relies heavily on DBI not only for retrieval,
storage and removal of data, but also for querying the database for
metadata about field types.

<P>
<STRONG>Template Toolkit</STRONG>



<P>
The Template Toolkit is a very robust and mature templating system.
Although OpenInteract is setup so that you can use different templating
implementations (including your own), Template Toolkit is strongly
recommended. All of the templates included with OpenInteract use the
Template Toolkit.


<H1>Data abstraction: SPOPS</H1>
<P>
One of the ways that OpenInteract sets itself apart from other web
application frameworks is the data abstraction subsystem, called SPOPS
(Simple Perl Object Persistence with Security). SPOPS allows you to add
definitions for data objects and have them be available throughout your
application.

<H1>Security</H1>
<P>
The last 'S' in SPOPS stands for Security. Security is built into the SPOPS
from the beginning. If a user does not have access to view a particular
data object, the system never even knows that it exists.

<P>
Enabling an object to use security is as simple as a few lines in the SPOPS
configuration. Afterward, you can set the security for the entire world, or
on a per-group and per-user basis. Each user and group can have specific
permissions to an object, and the most specific permission is always
utilized. 

<P>
The SPOPS security model is also utilized for tasks, not just objects. For
instance, you might want to establish a policy that states all users who
are not logged in can view events, but they cannot add new ones. This sort
of policy is simple to create. 

<P>
<H1>Configuration</H1>
<P>
Configuration of OpenInteract is done through human-readable and editable
text files. There are a number of files, but this is to allow application
packages to exist independently of one another. This also enables each
configuration file to be brief and to the point.

<P>
<H1>Error handling</H1>
<P>
OpenInteract has a fairly robust error handling system that allows certain
errors to simply be logged into the system, others to trigger a
notification to an administrator or module author, and others to change
what the user sees onscreen.

<P>
In addition, the system ships with a very capable error browsing
application that allows you to filter errors by date or type, making it
easy to pinpoint problems in your website.

<P>
<H1>Users and groups</H1>
<P>
OpenInteract uses a very simple, flexible and standard scheme of users and
groups. The scheme is characterized by the following:

<UL>

<LI>The system comes configured with a superuser and a supergroup. The
superuser and the members of the supergroup can do anything and see
anything

<li>You can create as many users and groups as you like, and users can
create their own accounts through a web browser.

<LI>A user can belong to more than one group.

<LI>A user cannot belong to a group for which he/she does not have
read access.

</UL>

<P>
That's it.

<P>
<H1>Templates</H1>
<P>
Just about everything you see in OpenInteract is a template. You can
develop your own module for filling the template with data, but we
recommend you use the Template Toolkit, which is robust, mature and under
active development.

<P>
You can edit templates using a web browser interface. In the future, you
will also be able to edit a template and its meta information via a
separate, more expressive interface such as Perl/Tk, Java or perhaps even
Dreamweaver.

<P>
<H1>Themes</H1>

<p>The appearance of an OpenInteract application is almost entirely
controlled by a theme. A theme defines the appearance of background
colors, fonts, border colors of boxes, and standard graphical elements
like bullets, etc. Themes implement the notion of "style sheets" in
OpenInteract. (This is not to be confused with Cascading Style Sheets,
which are a different means to control the appearance of raw HTML.)

<p>You can define as many themes as you like, inheriting most
attributes from a parent theme and only overriding a few. Setting the
theme to be used is as simple as a few clicks, and you can develop
themes behind the scenes, testing out and tweaking the appearance,
then rolling it out for everyone.
