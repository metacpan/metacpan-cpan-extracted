0.016     2014-04-04 09:27:44-04:00 America/New_York
  * doc fix

0.015     2014-04-03 21:11:22-04:00 America/New_York
  * added option to let someone choose the word list for iterators and anagram
    lists

0.014     2014-03-30 21:28:02-04:00 America/New_York
  * improved iterator so it doesn't pre-load the next iteration

0.013     2014-03-30 13:49:42-04:00 America/New_York
  * optimization: use least-branchy letters
  * added iterator generator

0.012     2014-03-23 12:43:04-04:00 America/New_York
  * fixed minimum anagram count bug: if the minimum could not be found, it would
    fail to translate the word numbers back into words

0.011     2014-03-22 17:55:10-04:00 America/New_York
  * cleaned up some debugging code

0.010     2014-03-22 17:52:55-04:00 America/New_York
  * allow cascading word lists
  * minimum anagram count parameter

0.009     2014-03-21 14:01:07-04:00 America/New_York
  * made sorting optional and added it for entire list
  * added [MinimumPerl] to dist.ini to prevent some failure reports

0.008     2014-03-18 20:21:59-04:00 America/New_York
  * slight optimization of stack handling
  * added pruning of impossible branches (see TODO)
  * pruning redundant branches in search

0.007     2014-03-18 06:43:36-04:00 America/New_York
  * fresh release not larded up with accidental crud

0.006     2014-03-17 13:22:55-04:00 America/New_York
  * still better (accidentally released unsuccessful experiment with .005)

0.005     2014-03-17 13:18:54-04:00 America/New_York
  * another wee optimization, this in the summing of character counts

0.004     2014-03-17 12:58:05-04:00 America/New_York
  * re-use empty list for all terminals to save some memory

0.003     2014-03-17 10:03:44-04:00 America/New_York
  * Some micro-optimizations and simplifications of little functional impart.
    The cache might use a bit less memory now as the keys are shorter.

0.002     2014-03-16 20:43:25-04:00 America/New_York
  * convert words to integers (further) to improve memory use

0.001     2014-03-16 17:18:00-04:00 America/New_York
  * initial release
