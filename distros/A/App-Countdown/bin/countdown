=head1 NAME

=head1 USAGE

    countdown [number of seconds]
    countdown [minutes]m
    countdown [hours]h
    countdown [seconds]s
    countdown [minutes]m[seconds]s
    countdown [hours]h[minutes]m[seconds]s

    --man - displays the man page.
    --help - displays the help.
    --version - displays the version.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<countdown> waits for a certain time to pass, in a similar fashion to the
UNIX sleep command, but unlike sleep, it displays the amount of time left to
sleep. I always found it frustrating that I've placed an alarm using
C<sleep $secs ; finish-client> and could not tell how much time left, so I
wrote B<countdown> for that.

=head1 EXAMPLES

    $ countdown 30s # 30 seconds

    $ countdown 1m  # 1 minute

    $ countdown 100 # 100 seconds

    $ countdown 2h  # 2 hours

    $ countdown 2m30s # 2 minutes and 30 seconds.

    $ countdown 1h0m30s # 1 hour, 0 minutes and 30 seconds.
