NAME

    Test::Fixme - Check code for FIXMEs.

VERSION

    version 0.17

SYNOPSIS

     # In a test script like 't/test-fixme.t'
     use Test::Fixme;
     run_tests();
     
     # You can also tailor the behaviour.
     use Test::Fixme;
     run_tests( where    => 'lib',      # where to find files to check
                match    => 'TODO',     # what to check for
                skip_all => $ENV{SKIP}  # should all tests be skipped
     );

DESCRIPTION

    When coding it is common to come up against problems that need to be
    addressed but that are not a big deal at the moment. What generally
    happens is that the coder adds comments like:

     # FIXME - what about windows that are bigger than the screen?
     
     # FIXME - add checking of user privileges here.

    Test::Fixme allows you to add a test file that ensures that none of
    these get forgotten in the module.

METHODS

 run_tests

    By default run_tests will search for 'FIXME' in all the files it can
    find in the project. You can change these defaults by using 'where' or
    'match' as follows:

     run_tests( where => 'lib', # just check the modules.
                match => 'TODO' # look for things that are not done yet.
     );

    where

      Specifies where to search for files. This can be a scalar containing
      a single directory name, or it can be a list reference containing
      multiple directory names.

    match

      Expression to search for within the files. This may be a simple
      string, or a qr//-quoted regular expression. For example:

       match => qr/[T]ODO|[F]IXME|[B]UG/,

    filename_match

      Expression to filter file names. This should be a qr//-quoted regular
      expression. For example:

       match => qr/\.(:pm|pl)$/,

      would only match .pm and .pl files under your specified directory.

    manifest

      Specifies the name of your MANIFEST file which will be used as the
      list of files to test instead of where or filename_match.

       manifest => 'MANIFEST',

    warn

      Do not fail when a FIXME or other pattern is matched. Tests that
      would have been failures will still issue a diagnostic that will be
      viewed when you run prove without -v, make test or ./Build test.

    format

      Specifies format to be used for display of pattern matches.

      original

	The original and currently default format looks something like
	this:

         # File: './lib/Test/Fixme.pm'
         #     16      # ABSTRACT: Check code for FIXMEs.
         #     25          $args{match} = 'FIXME' unless defined $args{match} && length $args{match};
         #     28          $args{format} ||= $ENV{TEST_FIXME_FORMAT};
         #     228      # FIXME - what about windows that are bigger than the screen?
         #     230      # FIXME - add checking of user privileges here.
         #     239     By default run_tests will search for 'FIXME' in all the files it can
         #     280     Do not fail when a FIXME or other pattern is matched.  Tests that would
         #     288     If you want to match something other than 'FIXME' then you may find
         #     296      run_tests( skip_all => $ENV{SKIP_TEST_FIXME} );
         #     303     L<Devel::FIXME>

	With the line numbers on the left and the offending text on the
	right.

      perl

	The "perl" format is that used by Perl itself to report warnings
	and errors.

         # Pattern found at ./lib/Test/Fixme.pm line 16:
         #  # ABSTRACT: Check code for FIXMEs.
         # Pattern found at ./lib/Test/Fixme.pm line 25:
         #      $args{match} = 'FIXME' unless defined $args{match} && length $args{match};
         # Pattern found at ./lib/Test/Fixme.pm line 28:
         #      $args{format} ||= $ENV{TEST_FIXME_FORMAT};
         # Pattern found at ./lib/Test/Fixme.pm line 228:
         #   # FIXME - what about windows that are bigger than the screen?
         # Pattern found at ./lib/Test/Fixme.pm line 230:
         #   # FIXME - add checking of user privileges here.
         # Pattern found at ./lib/Test/Fixme.pm line 239:
         #  By default run_tests will search for 'FIXME' in all the files it can
         # Pattern found at ./lib/Test/Fixme.pm line 280:
         #  Do not fail when a FIXME or other pattern is matched.  Tests that would
         # Pattern found at ./lib/Test/Fixme.pm line 288:
         #  If you want to match something other than 'FIXME' then you may find
         # Pattern found at ./lib/Test/Fixme.pm line 296:
         #   run_tests( skip_all => $ENV{SKIP_TEST_FIXME} );
         # Pattern found at ./lib/Test/Fixme.pm line 303:
         #  L<Devel::FIXME>

	For files that contain many offending patterns it may be a bit
	harder to read for humans, but easier to parse for IDEs.

      You may also use the TEST_FIXME_FORMAT environment variable to
      override either the default or the value specified in the test file.

HINTS

    If you want to match something other than 'FIXME' then you may find
    that the test file itself is being caught. Try doing this:

     run_tests( match => 'TO'.'DO' );

    You may also wish to suppress the tests - try this:

     use Test::Fixme;
     run_tests( skip_all => $ENV{SKIP_TEST_FIXME} );

    You can only run run_tests once per file. Please use several test files
    if you want to run several different tests.

CAVEATS

    This module is fully supported back to Perl 5.8.1. It may work on
    5.8.0. It should work on Perl 5.6.x and I may even test on 5.6.2. I
    will accept patches to maintain compatibility for such older Perls, but
    you may need to fix it on 5.6.x / 5.8.0 and send me a patch.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

    Dave O'Neill added support for 'filename_match' and also being able to
    pass a list of several directories in the 'where' argument. Many
    thanks.
