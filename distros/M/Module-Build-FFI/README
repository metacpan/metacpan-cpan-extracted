NAME

    Module::Build::FFI - Build Perl extensions in C with FFI

VERSION

    version 0.46

SYNOPSIS

    In your Build.PL

     use Modue::Build::FFI 0.04;
     Module::Build::FFI->new(
       module_name => 'Foo::Bar',
       ...
     )->create_build_script;

    or dist.ini:

     [ModuleBuild]
     mb_class = Module::Build::FFI
     
     [Prereqs / ConfigureRequires]
     Module::Build::FFI = 0.04

    Put your .c and .h files in ffi (ffi/example.c):

     #include <ffi_util.h>
     #include <stdio.h>
     
     FFI_UTIL_EXPORT void
     print_hello(void)
     {
       printf("hello world\n");
     }

    Attach it to Perl in your main module (lib/Foo/Bar.pm):

     package Foo::Bar;
     
     use FFI::Platypus;
     
     my $ffi = FFI::Platypus->new;
     $ffi->package;  # search for symbols in your bundled C code
     $ffi->attach( hello_world => [] => 'void');

    Finally, use it from your perl script or module:

     use Foo::Bar;
     Foo::Bar::hello_world();  # prints "hello world\n"

DESCRIPTION

    Module::Build variant for writing Perl extensions in C and FFI (sans
    XS).

PROPERTIES

    ffi_source_dir

      [version 0.15]

      By default, C source files in the ffi directory are compiled and
      linked, if that directory exists. You can change that directory with
      this property.

      [version 0.18]

      This can be a scalar or a array reference.

    ffi_libtest_dir

      [version 0.15]

      If the libtest directory (libtest by default) exists, then C source
      files will be compiled and linked into a test dynamic library that
      you can use to test your FFI module with. You can use FFI::CheckLib
      to find the library from your test:

       use Test::More;
       use FFI::Platypus;
       use FFI::CheckLib;
       
       FFI::Platypus->new->lib(find_lib lib => 'test', libpath => 'libtest');

      [version 0.18]

      This can be a scalar or a array reference.

    ffi_include_dir

      [version 0.15]

      If there is an include directory with your distribution with C header
      files in it, it will be included in the search path for the C files
      in both the ffi and libtest directories.

      [version 0.18]

      This can be a scalar or a array reference.

    ffi_libtest_optional

      [version 0.15]

      If there is no compiler then libtest cannot be built. By default this
      is not fatal. Your tests need to be written in such a way that any
      that use libtest are skipped when it is not there.

       use Test::More;
       use FFI::CheckLib;
       
       plan skip_all => 'test requires a compiler'
         unless find_lib lib => 'test', libpath => 'libtest';

      If you do not want to support environments without a compiler you can
      set this property to 1 and you won't need to have that check in your
      test files.

ACTIONS

 ffi

     ./Build ffi

    This builds any C files that are bundled with your distribution
    (usually in the ffi directory). If there is no ffi directory, then this
    action does nothing.

    This action is triggered automatically before ./Build build.

 libtest

     ./Build libtest

    This builds libtest. If you do not have a libtest directory, then this
    action does nothing.

    This action is triggered automatically before ./Build test.

MACROS

    Defined in ffi_util.h

    FFI_UTIL_VERSION

      [version 0.04]

      This is the FFI::Platypus (prior to version 0.15 it was the FFI::Util
      version number) version number multiplied by 100 (so it would be 4
      for 0.04 and 101 for 1.01).

    FFI_UTIL_EXPORT

      [version 0.04]

      The appropriate attribute needed to export functions from shared
      libraries / DLLs. For now this is only necessary on Windows when
      using Microsoft Visual C++, but it may be necessary elsewhere in the
      future.

METHODS

 ffi_have_compiler

    [version 0.18]

     my $has_compiler = $mb->ffi_have_compiler;

    Returns true if a C or C++ compiler is available.

    Only checks for C++ if you appear to have C++ source.

    Override for other foreign language subclasses.

 ffi_build_dynamic_lib

    [version 0.18]

     my $dll_path = $mb->ffi_build_dynamic_lib($src_dir, $name, $target_dir);
     my $dll_path = $mb->ffi_build_dynamic_lib($src_dir, $name);

    Compiles the C and C++ source in the $src_dir and link it into a
    dynamic library with base name of $name.$Config{dlext}. If $target_dir
    is specified then the dynamic library will be delivered into that
    directory.

    Override for other foreign language subclasses.

 ffi_dlext

     my @dlext = Module::Build::FFI->ffi_dlext;

    Returns a list of legal dynamic library extensions. $Config{dlext} is
    good, but many platforms use more than one extension for dynamic
    libraries. For example, on Mac OS X, there are two different dynamic
    library types .bundle and .dylib and sometimes these renamed .so files.
    Although .bundle and .dylib have subtle differences, they can both be
    used by FFI::Platypus.
