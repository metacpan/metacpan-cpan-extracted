This change log is for the Device::Davis module and vanprod.  My first 
intention was not to distribute either of these at all, but some friends
talked me into it, so I have broken the daemon and the module apart into
their own distributions, in order to follow the accepted conventions on
CPAN.  Device::Davis and vanprod were written and developed by Stan
Sander.  Vanprod started on 9/27/03 after I discovered that Davis Instruments
had released a  technical reference document detailing the protocol used for
communicating with the Vantage Pro weather station.  I had previously hacked
together a workable daemon that read the values from the station, updated 
weatherunderground, loaded the daily minimum and maximum values into a mysql
database, and generated some plain text files that were parsed by two other
scripts I wrote.  This original daemon was based on some C code written by
Lew Riley (rileyle@earlham.edu http://www.cs.earlham.edu/~weather/) for 
communicating with a Davis Weatherlink station and also some pre-release
information courtesy of Davis Weather Instruments. 

10/8/03
Started documentation.

10/11/2003 version 0.5
Well the re-write seems to be pretty much in order.  All of the functionality
of the original is still intact and some of the routines have been improved.
I'll call this version 0.5, since I do have several
enhancements on my list of things that I want to do.  It does function well
enough to be a version 1.0, but I'm just not ready to go that far yet. 
 
0.55 

Added crc_accum function to calculate crc's to be sent or recieved from the 
weather station.

0.61

Added station_open function to ensure that the tty was opened with the correct
parameters.  Somehow once I rebooted my system, I discovered that what I had 
written using POSIX calls from perl didn't quite do the right things. 

1.0  10/25/03

Seperated the module and the daemon.  Uploaded the module to CPAN.  Daemon 
should follow shortly in the scripts area.  

1.01 12/24/03

Minor bugfix release.  Fixed error in test.pl script that called the module 
incorrectly.  

1.1 12/31/03

Added put_unsigned function for sending numeric values to the station as a
single byte of data.

1.1.1 1/02/04

Bugfix release.  Re-did lots of stuff in the test.pl script.  Added output to
a test.log file to make debugging problems easier. 

1.2  8/7/04

Incorporated a patch by Wes Young.  This enables the module to function 
correctly on a Mac (OS X) platform.   

1.2.2

Made some changes in order to be CPAN tester friendly.
