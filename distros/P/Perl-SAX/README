NAME
    Perl::SAX - Generate SAX events for perl source code (incomplete)

DESCRIPTION
    With the completion of PPI and the potential creation of a viable
    refactoring Perl editor, there has been renewed interest in parsing perl
    source code and "Doing Stuff" with it.

    It was felt (actually, it was demanded) that there should be some sort
    of event mechanism that could go through a chunk of perl source code and
    emit events that would be handled by a variety of methods.

    Rather than invent my own, it was much easier to hijack SAX for this
    purpose.

    "Perl::SAX" is the result of this need. Starting with a single object of
    any type descended from PPI::Node, "Perl::SAX" will generate a stream of
    SAX events.

    For the sake of compatibility with SAX as a whole, and in the spirit of
    not dictating the default behaviour based on any one use of this event
    stream, the stream of events will be such that it can be passed to
    XML::SAX::Writer and a "PerlML" file will be spat out.

    This provides the highest level of detail, and allows for a variety of
    different potential uses, relating to both the actual and lexical
    content inside of perl source code.

  Perl::SAX is just a SAX Driver
    Please note that "Perl::SAX" is only a SAX Driver. It cannot be used as
    a SAX Filter or some other form of SAX Handler, and will die fatally if
    you try, as soon as it recieves a "start_document" event.

    To restart Perl::SAX only creates events, it cannot consume them.

  Current State of Completion
    This basic first working version is being uploaded to support the
    creation of an Acme::Bleach rip-off using PerlML.

METHODS
  new [ Handler => $Handler | Output => $WriterConsumer ]
    The "new" constructor creates a new Perl SAX Driver instance.

    If passed no arguments, it creates a new default XML::SAX::Writer
    object, which by default will write the resulting PerlML file to STDOUT.

    If passed an "Output => $Consumer" argument, this value will be passed
    along to the XML::SAX::Writer constructor. Any value that is legal for
    the Output parameter to XML::SAX::Writer is also legal here.

    If passed a "Handler => $Handler" argument, $Handler will be used as the
    SAX Handler directly. Any value provided via Output in this case will be
    ignored.

    Returns a new "Perl::SAX" object, or "undef" if you pass an illegal
    Output value, and the XML::SAX::Writer cannot be created.

TO DO
    Design and create the PerlML Schema

    Make any changes needed to conform to it

    Write a bunch of tests

SUPPORT
    Because the development of the PerlML Schema (and thus this module) has
    not been completed yet, please do not report bugs other than those that
    are installation-related.

    Bugs should be reported via the CPAN bug tracker at

    <http://rt.cpan.org/NoAuth/ReportBug.html?Queue=Perl-SAX>

    For other issues, or commercial enhancement or support, contact the
    author.
