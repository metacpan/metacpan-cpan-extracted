Add retry_delay & retry_scale as transport attributes
or better to move to DBI transport base class

Add perl-status ui to recent_errors queue

Add more/clearer docs re configuration

Add note about HTTP::Engine - perhaps someone could contribute a driver that
uses it. Would probably want to refactor out parts of the mod_perl transport.
