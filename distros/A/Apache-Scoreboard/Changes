2.10 - Mon Mar 31 20:05:00 EST 2014

Update Makefile.PL to call build_config before referencing it as that seems to no longer happen automatically. Fixes build issue with perl 5.14 and later

2.09 - Tues Mar 4 15:58:00 EST 2008

Only process request if we're enabled for this uri (Patch from Gozer)

Improve apr header detection for build. (Some distributions install in ../include/apr, some in ../include/apr-1)


2.07 - dev

Apache::Scoreboard::image() now does magic so that image(new APR::Pool) doesn't segfault    - Stas

ported to modperl 2.0 API changes   - MJH

2.06 - Fri Mar 18 13:50:49 EST 2005

fix the buggy reconstruction of the fetched binary image in thaw()

fix start_time(), stop_time() to return usecs as the second argument

Revamping docs (still needs more work) 

Extending tests to test all worker score methods


2.05 - Sun Feb 27 11:16:46 EST 2005

apxs/mod_scoreboard_send.c has been ported to Apache 2.0

Apache::DummyScoreboard was ported to mp2 (this is used to process a
scoreboard outside running Apache).

when freezing/sending don't try to figure out what are the live
servers, since a sequential search doesn't work. if a server went
away, there will be a hole, e.g. if C goes down in ABCDE, we will get
ABXDE and send only AB info. so just send them all

added new methods $image->thread_limit and $image->server_limit and
deprecated the Apache::Const::SERVER_LIMIT and
Apache::Const::THREAD_LIMIT constants, since those are correct and
useful only for the image of the Apache server parsed from within the
running server.

use the passed image object, rather than accessing the global
ap_scoreboard_image. Previously we have switched to use Apache
accessors, instead of accessing the struct directly, but the problem
was that we no longer processed the real image object. So if the
script has acquired a different image (not the one seen by the current
process), we were handing bogus information. Now this has been fixed
by copying the apache accessors and changing them to use the passed
image.

2.04 - Sat Jan 22 00:13:35 EST 2005

s/sv_setpvf/Perl_sv_setpvf/ to support perls that don't have this
macro [Markus Wichitill <mawic@gmx.de>]

tests config: s/PerlHandler/PerlResponseHandler/ [Markus Wichitill
<mawic@gmx.de>]



2.03 - Sun Jan  2 17:24:54 EST 2005

in thaw() replace the usage of memmove with apr_pmemdup, since objects
created by the pool, can't mix memmove with apr pool allocation (found
this problem after apr was compiled with CPPFLAGS="-DAPR_BUCKET_DEBUG"
--enable-pool-debug, were getting segfaults when the pool was
destroyed)



2.02 - Tue Nov  9 18:50:29 EST 2004

- sync with mp2 API changed (s/APR::OS::Thread/U32/) and require
  1.99_17 where that change has happened



2.01 - Mon Dec 22 12:52:11 PST 2003

- forgot to require mod_perl 1.99_12



2.0 - Mon Dec 22 12:00:11 PST 2003

- First new generation release: work with Apache 2.0
