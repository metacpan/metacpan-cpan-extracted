<!-- David has Green hair here -->

King <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David">David</a> and Goliath were standing by each other.

David said unto Goliath: "I will shoot you. I <b>swear</b> I will"

<title>Goliath's Response</title>

<!-- Goliath has to reply to that. -->

Goliath was not amused.

He said to David: "Oh, really. <i>David</i>, the red-headed!".

David started listing Goliath's disadvantages:

<blockquote lang="fr-FR" id="my_blockquote">

<ol>

<li>

You're slow.

</li>

<li>

You're big.

</li>

<li>

You're stupid.

</li>

</ol>

Goliath was insulted and told David he should use bullets for the points,
instead:

<ul>

<li>

David.

</li>

<li>

Saul.

</li>

<li>

Jonathan.

</li>

<li>

Michal.

</li>

<li>

Meyrav.

</li>

</ul>

</blockquote>
