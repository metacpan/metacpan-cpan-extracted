Revision history for Perl extension SMS::AQL.

1.03 2025-03-04
- Remove live "get credit" test from t/1-basic.t
  We already have a mocked version of that, and it no longer works as the
  test account at AQL appears to be gone (or have a different pw)
  (thanks to andk, GH-4)

1.02 2015-03-20
- Declare HTTP::Message as a pre-req (thanks to pink-mist, GH-2)

1.00 2012-12-15
- Example script eg/send-sms added (useful for other programs to call, I use
  this from procmail to alert me when specific emails come in).

0.08 2008-03-18
Support for voice push messages (strictly speaking this ought to be in
a seperate module as it's not an SMS-related feature, but it makes sense
to group with here I think.  If I ever do seperate it, I'll probably go
for Net::AQL::SMS and Net::AQL::Voice, and have them use Net::AQL::Common
for shared implementation.)

0.07 2008-01-14
Minor changes to boost Kwalitee score on cpants.perl.org - mostly updated
META.yml (and also adding LWP::UserAgent as a pre-req in Makefile.PL)

0.06 2007-08-22
Changes to make SMS::AQL work under prehistoric perl 5.005

0.05 2007-08-14
Added support for connecting via a proxy - simply supply the proxy URL in
the options hashref when instantiating the object:
my $sms = new SMS::AQL({
    username => 'user',
    password => 'pass',
    options => {
        proxy => 'http://user:pass@host:port/',
    }
});

New release incorporating several improvements kindly submitted by
Ton Voon at Altinity (http://www.altinity.com/) - thanks Ton!  There's
numerous documentation improvements, better parsing of server responses,
and a new test script using Test::MockObject to exercise the module
code without actually interacting with the AQL servers or sending 
messages.  Nice work Ton, thanks for your contribution!

Previous versions had use 5.008007 in the Makefile, where I forgot to
change it.  There's nothing funky in this module that should require
5.8.7, 5.8.0 should be good enough.  Thanks to Nicola W for pointing
this out.

Also added new credit() method to return the number of message credits
available on the account.

Fix stupid, stupid bug #24201 - don't remove servers from the list of 
servers, unless we fail to send a message.  Previously, each instance 
of SMS::AQL could only send 4 messages in a row before starting to fail.
Obviously, passed all tests, only showed up in real usage.  Wibble.  
Also some minor style problems cleared up.

Important: constructor now takes a hashref of params to provide for 
future expansion needs.

development starts... pre-alpha version started life as Net::AQSMS::Send, 
name SMS::AQL was then agreed after brief discussion with modules@perl.org 
guys, Brian in particular - thanks for your input Brian.

Initial version is quite limited, but tested and works well for me.  
Not tested with non-UK destination numbers.
