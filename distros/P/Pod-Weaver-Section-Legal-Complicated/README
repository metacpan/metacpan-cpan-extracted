SYNOPSIS

    In your weaver.ini

      [Legal::Complicated]

DESCRIPTION

    This plugin is aimed at distributions that have several files, each of
    them with possibly different authors, copyright owners and licenses.

    It will look for these values in comments of the source code (analyzed
    through a ppi_document) with the following form:

      # AUTHOR:  John Doe <john.doe@otherside.com>
      # AUTHOR:  Mary Jane <mary.jane@thisside.com>
      # OWNER:   2001-2005 University of Over Here
      # OWNER:   2012 Mary Jane
      # LICENSE: GPL_3

    This example would generate the following POD:

      =head2 AUTHORS
    
      John Doe <john.doe@otherside.com>
      Mary Jane <mary.jane@thisside.com>
    
      =head2 COPYRIGHT
    
      This software is copyright (c) 2001-2005 by University of Over Here, and 2012 by Mary Jane.
    
      This software is available under The GNU General Public License, Version 3, June 2007.

    Note that this plugin makes a distinction between the authors (whoever
    wrote the code), and the actual copyright owners (possibly the person
    who paid them to write it).

    I am not a lawyer myself, any feedback on better ways to deal with this
    kind of situations is most welcome.

NOTE ON DEPENDENCIES

    This plugin is dependent on the Software::License::* module of the
    license being used. Since it is not feasible to list them all, only
    Software::License is listed as dependency (of the distribution, even
    though it is not actually used directly.

    If true, it will also add the distribution license to each of the
    files. Defaults to false. =attr head

    Sets the heading level for the legal section. Defaults to 1. sub
    _extract_comments { my (undef, $input, $tag) = @_; my $ppi_document =
    $input->{ppi_document};

      my @comments;
      $ppi_document->find( sub {
        my $ppi_node = $_[1];
        if ($ppi_node->isa('PPI::Token::Comment') &&
            $ppi_node->content =~ qr/^\s*#+\s*$tag:\s*(.+?)\s*$/m ) {

        }
        return 0;
      });
