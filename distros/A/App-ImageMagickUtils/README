FUNCTIONS
  convert_image_to
    Usage:

     convert_image_to(%args) -> [$status_code, $reason, $payload, \%result_meta]

    Convert images using ImageMagick's 'convert' utility, with multiple file
    support and automatic output naming.

    This is a simple wrapper to ImageMagick's "convert" utility to let you
    process multiple files using a single command:

     % convert-image-to --to pdf *.jpg

    is basically equivalent to:

     % for f in *.jpg; do convert "$f" "$f.pdf"; done

    This function is not exported.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   delete_original => *bool*

        Delete (unlink) the original file after downsizing.

        See also the "trash_original" option.

    *   files* => *array[filename]*

        (No description)

    *   quality => *int* (default: 92)

        Quality setting (for JPEG/PNG), 1 (best compression, worst quality)
        to 100 (least compression, best quality).

    *   to* => *str*

        (No description)

    *   trash_original => *bool*

        Trash the original file after downsizing.

        This option uses the File::Trash::FreeDesktop module to do the
        trashing. Compared to deletion, with this option you can still
        restore the trashed original files from the Trash directory.

        See also the "delete_original" option.

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element ($status_code) is an integer containing HTTP-like status
    code (200 means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second
    element ($reason) is a string containing error message, or something
    like "OK" if status is 200. Third element ($payload) is the actual
    result, but usually not present when enveloped result is an error
    response ($status_code is not 2xx). Fourth element (%result_meta) is
    called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information, much like how HTTP response headers provide additional
    metadata.

    Return value: (any)

  convert_image_to_jpg
    Usage:

     convert_image_to_jpg(%args) -> [$status_code, $reason, $payload, \%result_meta]

    Convert images to JPG using ImageMagick's 'convert' utility.

    This is a wrapper to "convert-image-to", with "--to" set to "jpg":

     % convert-image-to-pdf *.png

    is equivalent to:

     % convert-image-to --to jpg *.png

    which in turn is equivalent to:

     % for f in *.png; do convert "$f" "$f.jpg"; done

    This function is not exported.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   delete_original => *bool*

        Delete (unlink) the original file after downsizing.

        See also the "trash_original" option.

    *   files* => *array[filename]*

        to 100 (least compression, best quality).

    *   trash_original => *bool*

  downsize_image
    Usage:

     downsize_image(%args) -> [$status_code, $reason, $payload, \%result_meta]

    Reduce image size, by default via compressing to JPEG quality 40 and
    downsizing to 1024p.

    This utility uses convert utility to compress an image into JPEG with
    default quality of 40 and downsized to 1024p (shortest side to 1024px).

    Output filenames are:

     ORIGINAL_NAME.q40.jpg

    or (if downsizing is done):

     ORIGINAL_NAME.1024p-q40.jgp

    This function is not exported.

    This function supports dry-run operation.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   delete_original => *bool*

        Delete (unlink) the original file after downsizing.

        See also the "trash_original" option.

    *   downsize_to => *str* (default: 1024)

        Downsizing will only be done if the input image's shortest side is
        indeed larger then the target downsize.

        To disable downsizing, set "--downsize-to" to '' (empty string), or
        specify on "--dont-downsize" on the CLI.

    *   files* => *array[filename]*

        (No description)

    *   quality => *int* (default: 40)

        Quality setting (for JPEG/PNG), 1 (best compression, worst quality)
        to 100 (least compression, best quality).

    *   skip_downsized => *bool* (default: 1)

        Skip previously downsized images.

        By default, when given a filename that looks like it's already
        downsized, e.g. "foo.1024-q40.jpg" or "foo.q40.jpg", will skip
        downsizing. The "--no-skip-downsized" option will process such
        filenames nevertheless.

    *   skip_whatsapp => *bool* (default: 1)

        Skip WhatsApp images.

        By default, assuming that WhatsApp already compresses images, when
        given a filename that matches a WhatsApp image filename, e.g.
        "IMG-20220508-WA0001.jpg" (will be checked using
        Regexp::Pattern::Filename::Image::WhatsApp), will skip downsizing.
        The "--no-skip-whatsapp" option will process such filenames
        nevertheless.

    *   trash_original => *bool*

        Trash the original file after downsizing.

        This option uses the File::Trash::FreeDesktop module to do the
        trashing. Compared to deletion, with this option you can still
        restore the trashed original files from the Trash directory.

        See also the "delete_original" option.

    Special arguments:

    *   -dry_run => *bool*

        Pass -dry_run=>1 to enable simulation mode.

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element ($status_code) is an integer containing HTTP-like status
    code (200 means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second
    element ($reason) is a string containing error message, or something
    like "OK" if status is 200. Third element ($payload) is the actual
    result, but usually not present when enveloped result is an error
    response ($status_code is not 2xx). Fourth element (%result_meta) is
    called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information, much like how HTTP response headers provide additional
    metadata.

    Return value: (any)

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR,
    Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps
    required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
