Lingua::Klingon::Recode version 1.02
====================================

Lingua::Klingon::Recode is a module which allows you to convert Klingon
strings between various encodings, for example, from the so-called
"XIFAN HOL" encoding to the standard "tlhIngan Hol" encoding.

It currently supports the following encodings:

- "tlhIngan Hol" - the standard transliteration
  - This includes two variants "tlhingan hol" and "TLHINGAN HOL" which
    use only lower-case and upper-case letters, respectively; however,
    their use is discouraged since this confuses the letters 'q' and
    'Q'. Also, the letter sequence "ngh" or "NGH" cannot be
    disambiguated as ng+H or n+gh; it will be treated as the former.
    (For example, the tlhingan hol string "monghom" and the TLHINGAN HOL
    string "MONGHOM" are always interpreted as the tlhIngan Hol string
    "mongHom" [little neck?], never as the tlhIngan Hol string
    "monghom" [capital group?].)

- "XIFAN HOL" - another fairly common transliteration, this is the
  encoding of at least one Klingon font. Also available in lower-case
  ("xifan hol") and in versions that use 'z'/'Z' instead of "'" for the
  apostrophe ("XIFAN HOL DAJAXZAZ" / "xifan hol dajaxzaz").

- "uhmal gnj" - an encoding that enables Klingon text to sort correctly
  (that is, is an uhmal gnj character comes before another, then the
  corresponding "letter" in the standard transliteration comes before
  the other in the usual sort order). This encoding uses only the 26
  letters of the lower-case Roman alphabet; it is also available in an
  upper-case form "UHMAL GNJ".
