NAME

    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::ReadmeAnyFromPod - Automatically convert POD to a
    README in any format for Dist::Zilla

VERSION

    version 0.163250

SYNOPSIS

    In your dist.ini

        [ReadmeAnyFromPod]
        ; Default is plaintext README in build dir
    
        ; Using non-default options: POD format with custom filename in
        ; dist root, outside of build. Including this README in version
        ; control makes Github happy.
        [ReadmeAnyFromPod / ReadmePodInRoot]
        type = pod
        filename = README.pod
        location = root
    
        ; Using plugin name autodetection: Produces README.html in root
        [ ReadmeAnyFromPod / HtmlInRoot ]

DESCRIPTION

    Generates a README for your Dist::Zilla powered dist from its
    main_module in any of several formats. The generated README can be
    included in the build or created in the root of your dist for e.g.
    inclusion into version control.

 PLUGIN NAME AUTODETECTION

    If you give the plugin an appropriate name (a string after the slash)
    in your dist.ini, it will can parse the type and location attributes
    from it. The format is "Readme[TYPE]In[LOCATION]". The words "Readme"
    and "In" are optional, and the whole name is case-insensitive. The
    SYNOPSIS section above gives one example.

    When run with location = dist, this plugin runs in the FileMunger phase
    to create the new file. If it runs before another FileMunger plugin
    does, that happens to modify the input pod (like, say, [PodWeaver]),
    the README file contents will be recalculated, along with a warning
    that you should modify your dist.ini by referencing [ReadmeAnyFromPod]
    lower down in the file (the build still works, but is less efficient).

ATTRIBUTES

 type

    The file format for the readme. Supported types are "text", "markdown",
    "gfm" (Github-flavored markdown), "pod", and "html". Note that you are
    not advised to create a .pod file in the dist itself, as
    ExtUtils::MakeMaker will install that, both into PERL5LIB and MAN3DIR.

 filename

    The file name of the README file to produce. The default depends on the
    selected format.

 source_filename

    The file from which to extract POD for the content of the README. The
    default is the file of the main module of the dist. If the main module
    has a companion ".pod" file with the same basename, that is used as the
    default instead.

 location

    Where to put the generated README file. Choices are:

    build

      This puts the README in the directory where the dist is currently
      being built, where it will be incorporated into the dist.

    root

      This puts the README in the root directory (the same directory that
      contains dist.ini). The README will not be incorporated into the
      built dist.

    If you want to generate the same README file in both the build
    directory and the root directory, simply generate it in the build
    directory and use the [CopyFilesFromBuild] plugin to copy it to the
    dist root.

 phase

    At what phase to generate the README file. Choices are:

    build

      (Default) This generates the README at 'after build' time. A new
      README will be generated each time you build the dist.

    release

      This generates the README at 'after release' time. Note that this is
      too late to get the file into the generated tarball, and is therefore
      incompatible with location = build. However, this is ideal if you are
      using location = root and only want to update the README upon each
      release of your module.

METHODS

 gather_files

    We create the file early, so other plugins that need to have the full
    list of files are aware of what we will be generating.

 prune_files

    Files with location = root must also be pruned, so that they don't
    sneak into the next build by virtue of already existing in the root
    dir. (The alternative is that the user doesn't add them to the build in
    the first place, with an option to their GatherDir plugin.)

 munge_files

 munge_file

    Edits the content into the requested README file in the dist.

 after_build

    Create the requested README file at build time, if requested.

 after_release

    Create the requested README file at release time, if requested.

 get_readme_content

    Get the content of the README in the desired format.
