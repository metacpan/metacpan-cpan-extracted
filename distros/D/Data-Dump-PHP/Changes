Revision history for Data-Dump-PHP

0.10     2013-11-09 (SHARYANTO)

         [BUG FIXES]

         - No longer escape "@" as "\@" like in Perl, since it causes backslash
           to be printed (suggested by Darren Embry).

         - No longer escapes "\013" as "\v" and "\014" as "\f" since they are
           recognized only since PHP 5.2.5 (suggested by Darren Embry).


0.09     2013-11-07 (SHARYANTO)

         - No functional changes. Rebuild to test MetaCPAN indexing (previous
           release not indexed by MetaCPAN).


0.08     2013-09-09 (SHARYANTO)

         - No functional changes. Rebuild with MakeMaker instead of
           Module::Build because the latter is deprecated from core in 5.19.


0.07     2010-11-25 (SHARYANTO)

         - Update $VERSION


0.06     2010-11-25 (SHARYANTO)

         - Fix PHP escape sequence (PHP doesn't have \a, \b, \e but has \v)


0.05     2010-11-03 (SHARYANTO)

         - (apply Data::Dump change) Deal with the perl-5.13 (?^:...) regex
           construct


0.04     2010-04-14 (SHARYANTO)

         - Add flag ($Data::Dump::PHP::USE_LAMBDA, default 0) to output PHP 5.3
           code (which uses lambda function instead of the ugly
           create_function()).


0.03     2010-04-14 (SHARYANTO)
