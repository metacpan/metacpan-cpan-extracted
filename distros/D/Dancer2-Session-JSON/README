NAME
    Dancer2::Session::JSON - Dancer 2 session storage in files with JSON

VERSION
    version 0.003

DESCRIPTION
    This module implements Dancer 2 session engine based on JSON files.

    This backend can be used in single-machine production environments, but
    two things should be kept in mind: The content of the session files is
    not encrypted or protected in anyway and old session files should be
    purged by a CRON job.

CONFIGURATION
    The setting session should be set to "JSON" in order to use this session
    engine in a Dancer2 application.

    Files will be stored to the value of the setting "session_dir", whose
    default value is "appdir/sessions".

    Here is an example configuration that use this session engine and stores
    session files in /tmp/dancer-sessions

        session: "JSON"

        engines:
          session:
            JSON:
              session_dir: "/tmp/dancer-sessions"
