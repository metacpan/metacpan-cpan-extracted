SYNOPSIS

     use Locale::ID::GuessGender::FromFirstName qw/guess_gender/;
    
     my @res = guess_gender("Budi"); # ({ name=>"budi", result=>"M",
                                     #   guess_confidence=>1,
                                     #   gender_ratio => 1, algo=>"common" })
    
     # specify more detailed options, guess several names at once
     my @res = guess_gender({min_guess_confidence => 0.75,
                             algos => [qw/common v1_rules google/]},
                             "amita", "mega");

DESCRIPTION

    This module provides a function to guess the gender of commonly
    encountered people's names in Indonesia, using several algorithms.

FUNCTIONS

 guess_gender([OPTS, ]FIRSTNAME...) => (RES, ...)

    Guess the gender of given first name(s). An optional hashref OPTS can
    be given as the first argument. Valid pair for OPTS:

    algos => [ALGO, ...]

      Set the algorithms to use, in that order. Default is [qw/common
      v1_rules/]. Known algorithms: common (try to match from the list of
      common names), v1_rules (use some simple heuristics), google (compare
      the number of Google search results for "bapak FIRSTNAME" vs "ibu
      FIRSTNAME").

      The choice of algorithms can severely impact the result. For example,
      "Mega" is actually pretty ambivalent, used by both females and males.
      But Google search for "ibu mega" will return much more results than
      "bapak mega", thus the google algorithm will decide that "Mega" is
      predominantly female.

    min_guess_confidence => FRACTION

      Minimum guess confidence level to accept an algorithm's guess as the
      final answer, a number between 0 and 1. Default is 0.51 (51%).

    try_all => BOOL

      Whether to try all algorithms specified in algorithms. Default is 0,
      which means stop trying after an algorithm succeeds to generate guess
      with specified minimum guess confidence. If set to 1, all algorithms
      will be tried and the best result used.

    algo_opts => {ALGO => OPTS, ...}

      Specify per-algorithm options. See the algorithm's documentation for
      known options.

    Will return a result hashref RES for each given input. Known pair of
    RES:

    result => "M" or "F" or "both" OR "neither" OR undef

      The final guess result. undef if no algorithm succeeded. "M" if name
      is predominantly male. "F" if name is predominantly female. "both" if
      name is ambivalent. "neither" if sufficiently confident that the name
      is not a person's name.

    guess_confidence => FRACTION

      The final guess confidence level.

    gender_ratio => FRACTION

      Estimation of gender ratio. 1 (100%) means the name is always used
      for male or female. 0.9 (90%) means sometimes (about 10% of the time)
      the name is also used for the opposite sex. If the gender ratio is
      close to 0.5 it means the name is ambivalent and often used equally
      by males and females.

    algo => FRACTION

      The algo that is used to get the final result.

    algo_res => [RES, ...]

      Per-algorithm result. Usually only useful for debugging.

BUGS/TODOS

    This is a preliminary release. List of common names is not very
    complete. Heuristic rules are still too simplistic. Expect the accuracy
    of this module to improve in subsequent releases.
