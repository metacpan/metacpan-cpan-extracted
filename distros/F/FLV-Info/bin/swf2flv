=head1 NAME

swf2flv - Transform a video SWF into an FLV

=head1 SYNOPSIS

swf2flv [options] file.swf file.flv

 Options:
   -s --skipframes=n   How many blank frames are expected at the beginning of the video
                       Defaults to 1, which is appropriate for On2 Flix output.
   -v --verbose        Print diagnostic messages
   -h --help           Verbose help message
   -V --version        Print version

=head1 DESCRIPTION

With respect to video and audio content, FLV and SWF files have very
similar data inside, and differ primarily in metadata.  Very roughly,
one can think of an FLV file as a subset of a SWF file.

Therefore, one can easily transcode from SWF to FLV and back without
much work apart from fiddling with headers and the like.

=head1 CAVEATS AND LIMITATIONS

B<WARNING:> This does not work on any old SWF!  It has to be a
video/audio-dominated SWF.  Don't be surprised if it fails to extract
content from some arbitrary SWF you built or download.  In particular,
it does not handle vector animation.

Supports Flash MX and Flash 8 video (that is, Sorenson H.263 and On2
VP6.2 respectively).  Flash screen video and VP6 with alpha are both
untested but might work.

Supports MP3 audio.  Other audio formats are untested but might work.

Does not support multiple video or audio streams in the same file.

Emits Greenwich time in the C<creationdate> meta tag, not local time.
