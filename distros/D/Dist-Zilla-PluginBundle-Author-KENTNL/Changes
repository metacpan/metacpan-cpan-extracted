2.025001 2015-07-05T03:52:11Z 31e79e3
 [Bugfix]
 - Use a newer contributing module in pre-emption of ether accepting my patch

 [Dependencies::Stats]
 - Dependencies changed since 2.025000, see misc/*.deps* for details
 - develop: ↑1
 - runtime: ↑1

 [Note]
 - I really hate having so many plugins, and I really hate everyone needing my bundle
 - But I also hate anyone needing my bundle.

 [Todo]
 - Have a system where more static stuff happens at a dedicated phases instead of part of the build cycle
 - Not have contributors need to execute that to simply refresh files that are already there.

2.025000 2015-06-30T02:35:26Z 8f4450c
 [00 Features]

2.024000 2015-02-28T17:36:05Z ffe5dea
 [Compatibility Breaking Changes]
 - CommitBuild now builds to 'builds' regardless what branch you're on. This is mostly to negate hassle  involved with
   working on multiple branches blocking activity due to 'dzil build' doing the wrong thing and creating new, disjoint
   branches on its own.

 [Features]
 - Use a less aggressive technique for recommending newer EUMM/TB to be slightly more stable and do 99% of what I mean
   without so much commit churn.
 - Selected packages auto-recommend selected versions as implied upgrade ( much more preceise and less automatic than
   all my random 'MatchInstalled' rubbish

 [Packaging]
 - Moved a boatload of hard required deps that were really mostly recommendations to where they belong.
 - Drop "ramp all the things" version insanity ( caveat: more things are going to break now due to not knowing all
   minimum deps )

 - `soft` = copy dependencies on toolkit to recommended, and ramp recommended
