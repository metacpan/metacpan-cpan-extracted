2003-01-11  Jason E. Stewart  <jason@openinformatics.com>

	* MAGE.pm (Repository): 
	new version (20020902.3)

2003-03-07  Jason E. Stewart  <jason@openinformatics.com>

	* MAGE/XML/Writer.pm (Repository): 
	to decide whether to only write a _ref element, the code delays
	   writing the start tag until after:
	   1) it's seen attributes other than identifier
	   2) it's seen an association with an object
	needed to add check for writing end tag as well
	write_start_tag() now buffers itself. It is flushed in
	   obj2mageml() when an association is seen, or when an empty
	   element is written

	   - this can't happen now that packages are put on the stack

	* XMLUtils/XMLUtils.pm (Repository): 
	typo: get/set_attribute => get/set_slot

	   copies of the Reader's attributes, instead it now can access
	   the Reader directly
	removed many uses of Handler hash keys directly, made them
	   attributes, two cases remain: 
	   __PRIVATE: won't change
	   classes: will change by adding factory interface
	all attribute hash keys begin with '__' except class names which
	   will go away soon
