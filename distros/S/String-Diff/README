DESCRIPTION

    String::Diff is the difference of a consecutive string is made. after
    general diff is done, the difference in the line is searchable.

    the mark of the addition and the deletion can be freely changed. the
    color is colored to the terminal with ANSI, using the HTML display it.

    after the line is divided, diff is taken when 'linebreak' option is
    specified.

      my($old_string, $new_string) = String::Diff::diff_fully('this is Perl', 'this is Ruby', linebreak => 1);
      my($old_string, $new_string) = String::Diff::diff('this is Perl', 'this is Ruby', linebreak => 1);
      my $string = String::Diff::diff_merge('this is Perl', 'this is Ruby', linebreak => 1);
      my $string = String::Diff::diff_regexp('this is Perl', 'this is Ruby', linebreak => 1);

    In diff and diff_merge methods the mark of the difference can be
    changed.

      my $diff = String::Diff::diff('this is Perl', 'this is Ruby',
          remove_open => '<del>',
          remove_close => '</del>',
          append_open => '<ins>',
          append_close => '</ins>',
      );

    You can escape callback set to diff function and diff_merge function.

      use HTML::Entities
      my($diff_old, $diff_new) = String::Diff::diff(
          'this is <b>Perl</b>',
          'this is <b><BIG>R</BIG>uby</b>',
          remove_open => '<del>',
          remove_close => '</del>',
          append_open => '<ins>',
          append_close => '</ins>',
          escape       => sub { encode_entities($_[0]) },
      });
      is($diff_old, 'this is &lt;b&gt;<del>Perl</del>&lt;/b&gt;');
      is($diff_new, 'this is &lt;b&gt;<ins>&lt;BIG&gt;R&lt;/BIG&gt;uby</ins>&lt;/b&gt;');

METHODS

    diff_fully

        the list that divides diff according to the mark is returnd.
      
          my($old_string, $new_string) = String::Diff::diff_fully('this is Perl', 'this is Ruby');

    diff

        abd the mark of the deletion and the addition is given to the string.

    diff_merge

        old and new string is merged with diff.

    diff_regexp

        the regular expression to which old string and new string are matched with regexp is returned.
