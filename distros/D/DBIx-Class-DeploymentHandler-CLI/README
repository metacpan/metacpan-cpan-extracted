NAME

    DBIx::Class::DeploymentHandler::CLI - Command line interface for
    deployment handler

VERSION

    Version 0.002

SYNOPSIS

    This module provides an command line interface for
    DBIx::Class::DeploymentHandler.

    A sample script using this module looks like:

        #! /usr/bin/env perl
    
        use strict;
        use warnings;
    
        use PerlDance::Schema;
        use DBIx::Class::DeploymentHandler::CLI;
    
        my $schema = PerlDance::Schema->connect('perldance');
    
        my $dh_cli = DBIx::Class::DeploymentHandler::CLI->new(
            schema => $schema,
            databases => 'MySQL',
            args => \@ARGV,
        );
    
        if (my $ret = $dh_cli->run) {
           print $ret, "\n";
        }

    Let's assume that you name the script dh-cli.

    Now you can call the module's methods through commandline parameters:

        ./dh-cli prepare-version-storage
        ./dh-cli install-version-storage

    It doesn't matter whether you use dashes ( - ) or underscores ( _ ) in
    the function name.

BEST PRACTICES

    It is often desirable to follow what DeploymentHandler is doing, thus
    we recommendend to turn on debugging in your dh-cli script:

        BEGIN {
            $ENV{DBICDH_DEBUG} = 1;
        }

ATTRIBUTES

 schema

    DBIx::Class::Schema object. This parameter is required.

 databases

    Array reference with database names or single database name as a
    string. This parameter is required.

    It is passed directly to DBIx::Class::DeploymentHandler.

 sql_translator_args

    Hash reference with parameters for SQL::Translator.

    Defaults to:

        {
            add_drop_table => 0,
            producer_args => {
                mysql_version => 5,
            },
        }

    SQL::Translator defaults to use data types for totally outdated
    versions of MySQL, thus we force the major version almost all running
    instances are using.

    This prevents you from ending up with an enum MySQL data type for
    boolean columns in the schema instead of the boolean one supported by
    MySQL 5.

    It is passed directly to DBIx::Class::DeploymentHandler.

 args

    Array reference with commandline parameters.

 run

    Determines method to be run.

 version

    Prints database and schema version.

 database_version

    Retrieves schema version from database.

    Dies if version storage is missing from database.

    Returns 0 if version storage is present, but doesn't contain any
    records.

 schema_version

    Retrieves schema version from schema.

 custom_upgrade_directory

    Returns custom upgrade directory if possible.

 prepare_version_storage

 install_version_storage

 prepare_upgrade

 upgrade
