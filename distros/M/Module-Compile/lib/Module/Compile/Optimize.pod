=head1 SYNOPSIS

    package Foo;
    use Module::Optimize -base;

    sub pmc_optimize {

        # Convert perl5 $source into semantically equivalent $compiled_output
        return $compiled_output;
    }

In C<Bar.pm>:

    package Bar;

    use Foo;

or lexically:

    package Bar;

    }

    perl -c Bar.pm

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides a system for writing modules that I<compile> other
Perl modules.

Modules that use these compilation modules get compiled into some altered form
the first time they are run. The result is cached into C<.pmc> files.

Perl has native support for C<.pmc> files. It always checks for them, before
loading a C<.pm> file.

You get the following benefits:
