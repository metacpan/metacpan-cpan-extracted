examples
--------

This directory contains some (mostly *very* crude) examples of how the 
Net::Elexol::EtherIO24 module can be used.

YMMV.

'irig.pl' is the script I use to control my lawn & veggie garden irrigation system.

'write_fixed_address.pl' is a standalone script to program the fixed address in the EEPROM of the EIO24.

'linestatus' is a simple utility to look and set line status and direction of an EIO24.
