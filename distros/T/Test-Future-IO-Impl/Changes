Revision history for Test-Future-IO-Impl

0.17    2026-01-18
        [CHANGES]
         * Added tests for `poll` method

        [BUGFIXES]
         * Account for the fact that read or write IO operations may have
           already happened before they are cancelled
         * Clear the EAGAIN error from `$wr` filehandle in EAGAIN write test
           to stop perl writing annoying warnings during test

0.16    2026-01-07
        [BUGFIXES]
         * Be less sensitive to `->send` failure in peer-closed case, as OS
           behaviour differs here
         * sleep() unconditionally after closing listening server in connect
           test, as most OSes need it. 100msec is sufficient

0.15    2025-07-15
        [CHANGES]
         * Added tests for `send`, `recv` and `recvfrom` methods
         * Provide copies of `sysread` and `syswrite` tests named `read` and
           `write`

0.14    2023-04-25
        [CHANGES]
