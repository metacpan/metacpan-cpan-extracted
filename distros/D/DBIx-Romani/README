Romani is SQL and database abstraction layer that was inspired by Creole [1]
for PHP (part of the Propel [2] project) and portions of JDBC for Java [3].

What makes libraries like Creole and Romani unique, is that there isn't just an
attempt to address API differences between databases, but an attempt is made
to adapt for the differences in SQL dialects as well.  So it is more than just
another JDBC or DBI (in fact, DBI is used under the hood in the Perl version).

Creole accomplishes this by adding some utility functions for some of the more
tricky corners of SQL.  Romani provides all those same functions, but goes a
step further by providing an object oriented SQL abstraction.  This
abstraction is rather difficult for a human to use, but allows SQL statements
to be created, analyzed and modified by code --- which was key in implementing
Xmldoom [4].

Beyond this, Romani borrows a number of interface design concepts from JDBC
which improve efficiency and easy-of-use in a number of situations (ie.
prepared statement objects, return sets, etc...).

That said, Romani is still a work in progress very early in its life.  There is
still alot that needs filling out.

Enjoy!
