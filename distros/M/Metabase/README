NAME
    Metabase - A database framework and API for resource metadata

VERSION
    version 1.003

DESCRIPTION
    Metabase is a database framework and API for resource metadata. The
    framework describes how arbitrary data ("facts") are associated with
    particular resources or related to each other. The API describes how to
    store, retrieve, and search this information.

  History and Motivation
    Metabase was originally designed as a means of storing reports from the
    CPAN Testers project. When Metabase was initially developed, CPAN
    Testers reports were sent by individual testers to a single email
    server, which then forwarded them to a USENET group, which was
    considered the authoritative store. This presented problems: some
    testers couldn't send email, the system wasn't very searchable, was hard
    to mirror, and the data inside the system was entirely unstructured.

    Metabase aimed to avoid all of those problems by being
    transport-neutral, searchable and easier to mirror by design, and geared
    toward storing structured data. Simplicity is another design goal: while
    it has several moving parts, they're all simple and designed to be
    replaceable and extensible, rather than to be a perfect design up front.

OVERVIEW
    A Metabase has several parts:

    *   Metabase::Librarian, a class which manages access to the Archive and
        Index

    *   Metabase::Gateway, a role for managing submission of facts to the
        Librarian

    *   Metabase::Archive, a role for storing and retrieving facts

    *   Metabase::Index, a role for indexing and searching facts

    *   Metabase::Query, a role for translating a common query data
        structure into a backend-specific query

    Roles require implementations. These could use flat files, relational
    databases, object databases, cloud services, or anything else that can
    satisfy the role API.

    Metabase comes with some simple, stupid backends for testing:

    *   Metabase::Archive::Filesystem

    *   Metabase::Index::FlatFile

    Facts stored with in a Metabase are defined as subclasses of
    Metabase::Fact. Metabase::Report is a subclass that relates multiple
    facts.

    Metabase::Web provides the web API for storing, searching and retrieving
    facts. Metabase::Client::Simple is the client library to submit facts to
    a Metabase::Web server. A future Metabase::Client class will provide
    submit and search capabilities.
