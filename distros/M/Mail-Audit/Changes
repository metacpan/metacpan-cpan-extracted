            warning added; they were mostly undocumented
          moved to Module::Install

2.200_01  2006-05-24
          maintenance assumed by RJBS
          changes inherited from Meng Wong
          ???

2.1   -  2002-01-15 17:59:46
         Meng Weng Wong <mengwong@pobox.com> made some edits.

         ~username and strftime "interpolation" into accept() arguments.
         $mail->accept("~/Mail/In/%Y%m%d"); -> /home/matest/Mail/In/20020115

         multiple-argument accept() will deliver to multiple maildirs using
         single-inode multiple-hardlink style.

         emergency mailbox support if none of the accept()s work.

         deferral back to mailqueue if emergency couldn't get delivered.

         fixed the From header bug http://rt.cpan.org/NoAuth/Bug.html?id=118

         fixed the user method override bug with (@_) argument passing

         autocreation of parent and maildir cur/new/tmp dirs as necessary.

         support for MIME, with direct inheritance from Mail::Internet and
         MIME::Entity (as appropriate) instead of containment in ->{obj}. 
         added ->is_mime method.

         added "reply" method.  uses Mail::Mailer::sendmail.

         STDERR is directed to the logfile.

         added test infrastructure.

2.0   -  2001-12-10 19:51:17
         Jonathan Trull made Mail::Audit work with Exchange.
         Isn't that just gruesome?

         http://rt.cpan.org/NoAuth/Bug.html?id=60
