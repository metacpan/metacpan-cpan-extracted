=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides a number of PDL-threaded functions and bindings for use
with the Prima toolkit. Many of the functions are PDL bindings for the
standard Prima drawing functions. Others are useful functions for color
manipulation, or getting data into a form that PDL knows how to handle.
I generally divide the subroutines of this module into two categories:
B<methods> and B<functions>. The methods are subroutines that operate on a
Prima widget; the functions are subroutines that act on or return piddles.

Most of the methods given here are PDLified versions of the Prima drawing API
functions, which are documented under L<Prima::Drawable>. In general, where the
Prima API uses singular nouns, I here use plural nouns. A few of the methods
are only available in this module, mostly added to accomodate the needs of
L<PDL::Graphics::Prima>, the plotting library built on these bindings.

This bindings can be applied to B<any> object whose class is derived from
L<Prima::Drawable>, including displayed widgets and abstract canvases such
as L<Prima::PS::Printer>. If you create your own derived canvas, these
methods should Just Work. (I wish I could take credit for this, but it's
really due to the fact that Prima's internals are very well engineered.)

=head1 COORDINATE ORIGIN

The Prima image coordinate origin is located in lower left corner, which is
where you would expect to find it when creating plots. However, it is different
from the way that many graphics libraries do their coordinates.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=head2 piddle_of_patterns_for

If you want PDL to thread over line patterns, but you want to use the standard
Prima line patterns, you'll need to convert them line patterns to a piddle.
This works very simply like this:

 my $patterns = piddle_of_patterns_for(lp::Solid, lp::Dash);

This creates a piddle with the two patterns so that you could have PDL thread
over them.

You can also create your own line pattern piddles by hand. I recommend you use
byte array, since otherwise it will be converted to byte arrays for you.
The first element of a row in your byte array
specifies the number of pixels to be "on", the second specifies the number to be
"off", the third specifies the number to be "on" again, the fourth "off", the
fifth "on", etc. If that doesn't make sense, hopefully a couple of examples will
help clarify.

This example creates the equivalent of lp::Dash:

 my $dash_pattern = byte (9, 3);

This example creates a piddle with four line types: lp::Solid, lp::Dash,
lp::ShortDash, and lp::DashDot:

 my $patterns = byte q[ 1; 9 3; 3 3; 9 3 1 3];

and should be identical to

 my $patterns = piddle_of_patterns_for(
     lp::Solid, lp::Dash, lp::ShortDash, lp::DashDot);

When you create a byte piddle, all of the patterns must have the same number of
bytes in their specification. Of course, different patterns have different
lengths, so in that case simply pad the shorter specifications with zeroes.

=cut

# Builds a piddle of patterns with the appropriate sizes, etc.
sub piddle_of_patterns_for {
	# Make sure they're not being stupid:
	croak("You must supply at least one pattern to make a pattern piddle")
		if @_ == 0;

	# First get the longest pattern:
	my $length = 0;
	foreach(@_) {
		$length = length($_) if $length < length($_);
	}

	use PDL::NiceSlice;

	# Create the new byte array with the appropriate dimensions:
	my $to_return = zeroes(byte, $length, scalar(@_));
	$to_return .= $to_return->sequence;
	for (my $i = 0; $i < @_; $i++) {
		# Get a slice and update it:
		my $slice = $to_return(:,$i);
		substr ${$slice->get_dataref}, 0, length($_[$i]), $_[$i];

		# Make sure the modifications propogate back to the original:
		$slice->upd_data;
	}

	no PDL::NiceSlice;

	return $to_return;
}

#=head2 piddle_of_fillPatterns_for
#
#This function is not yet implemented, but some day it will return piddles
#for any Prima named fill pattern.
#
# It should be able to operate either by calling the fillPattern setter and
# immediately retrieving the resulting fill pattern, or by accessing the
# fill pattern collection directly. Don't know why that didn't work when I
# tried it earlier. Maybe I didn't de-reference the SV double-pointer?

=head1 METHODS

The methods described below are a bit unusual for PDL functions. First, they are
not actually PDL functions at all but are methods for C<Prima::Drawable>
objects. Second, their signatures will look a bit funny. Don't worry too much
about that, though, because they will resemble normal signatures close enough
that you should be able to understand them, I hope.

=for details
As far as I can tell, PDL::PP only defines the '_<func>_int' form of a function
when you specify a PMCode in the pp_def. I can't figure out where this happens
in PP.pm, but that appears to be the output behavior.

=head1 Complex parameter handling

Each of the functions in this module wrap a PDL function around the
Prima API. The goal of the PDL functions is to allow the caller to
provide as many or as few tweaks to their drawing as they wish, so if
they want to draw three different polylines with three different line
styles (as demonstrated in test.pl), they should be able to do this:

 $widget->pdl_polylines($xs, $ys, 
     linePatterns => $patterns,
     color => cl::Red
 );

and it will DWIM. That means that the PP functions have to (1) get all
the possible preferences---both singular and plural varieties---in as
piddle parameters, (2) the PP functions have to call the appropriate
functions from the widget handles virtual method table to do their work, and
(3) the PP functions have to package their piddles in a form that the method
from the method table knows how to handle. To make matters even more
complicated, different API functions pay attention to different properties,
so not every property is allowed for every function!

To deal with all of this, the next 400 or so lines of code create some
machinery that greatly assists in building the pp_defs that follow. A
great deal of this code is used in THIS script (.pd files are actually
scripts that generate .xs and .pm files) to assist in generating code.
Anything that needs to end up in the *output* files will be quoted, so
hopefully your syntax highlighter will help you pick them apart.

# Creating the look-up table for the Pars section #
###################################################

=begin details

This hash translates from a simple parameter name to a PDL signature.
Without this hash, if I wanted to write a function that allows the user
to draw lines with different colors, I would write the following Pars:

  Pars => 'int x(n); int y(n); int colors()'

So in the hash below, the property C<colors> is associated with the
arg string C<int colors()>.

=end details

=cut

my %pars_args_for = (colors => 'int colors()');

=begin details

At the moment, I only have the colors property. If you know the Prima
Drawable API, you'll know I'm missing a lot! This is because I will
build up a number of structures over this discourse and I would
like to keep the code and specifications for each property in one place.
Scroll down to the 'Building the machinery' portion of this code, about
400 lines below, and you'll see all the parts for each of the Drawable
properties defined in one place.

This function creates a string with the low-level PDL function's argument
list, given a list of properties for the function. This makes it very
easy to manage long parameter lists, and long parameter lists are nicely
handled by the in-pm function C<get_sorted_args_with_defaults>. To expand
on the previous example, in this code:

 pp_def('my_func',
        Pars => 'int x(n); int y(n); ' . generate_pars_args_for( 'colors', 'rops'),
        ...
 );

pp_def sees a parameter list that looks like this:

 'int x(n); int y(n); int colors(); int rops()'

To use this, I will create a list of properties that the to-be-defined
function takes, and use that together with generate_pars_args_for like
so:

 my @clear_properties = qw(backColors rop2s);
 pp_def('prima_clear',
        Pars => 'int x1(); int y1(); int x2(); int y2(); '
                 . generate_pars_args_for(@clear_properites),
        PMCode => ...
 );

It may seem silly to use such an array for only two additional arguments
(as shown in this example), but other parts of the pp_def call will make
use of that array, as we will see, and most of the functions use many
more properties.

# Property-dependent local variables #
######################################

=begin details

In order to determine if properties need to be changed in the middle of the
threadloop and at the end of the threadloop, we need to keep track of the
original and the current values of the different properties. By default I
assume that a copy of the property name with the same type as from the pars
args works. If this is not the case (such as for clipRects), I need to
provide values for C<%declare_args_for>. I also provide the simple
C<%cast_for> table in case the autogenerated code needs a cast to work
properly.

Functions that do not care about these properties will not need these
variables, so they should only be included in functions that actually
use them. C<generate_property_declarations_for> handles this code
generation, taking the same array of properties used by 
C<generate_pars_args_for>. See the next section for an example of use.

Note that entries in C<%declare_args_for> should be semi-colon seperated,
since they are C declarations, but the last entry should not have a 
semi-colon. One will be appended. This is to keep consistency with
C<%pars_args_for>, which has the same format.

For the colors, almost all the auto-generated code goes through cleanly,
except that I wish to cast the integer values to type Color. To handle this,
I have the following list as well.

=end details

# Colors has no special args declaration, but it does have special casting

my %cast_for = (colors => '(Color)');

# this will be automatically generated from the pars data.
my %uncast_for = ();

sub generate_property_declarations_for {
	my $to_return = pp_line_numbers(__LINE__, "\t\t/* Declare the property variables */\n");

	# Build the list:
	for my $property (@_) {
		if (exists $declare_args_for{$property}) {
			$to_return .= "\t\t$declare_args_for{$property};\n";
		}
		else {
			# Make sure that the pars args for this property don't have
			# multiple args:
			croak("pars_args has multiple values but not init_args for property $property")
				if $pars_args_for{$property} =~ /;/;
			# extract the type
			$pars_args_for{$property} =~ /(\w+)\s+\w+s\(\)/
				or croak("Unable to extract type for property $property");
			# All good; cook up the declarations
			my $type = $1;
			(my $singular = $property) =~ s/s$//;
			$to_return .= "\t\t$type orig_$singular, curr_$singular;\n";

# Tracking which properties need setting #
##########################################

=begin details

The only way to determine from within PP code whether an optional parameter
was passed in or not is to pass an additional structure to the PP code with
that information. The structure I use for this is the original hash passed
in as an argument to the Perl-level function. If the user specified a value
for a property, it will be present in the hash. If they did not, it will not
be there.

For each of the graphics properties that the user can supply for a given
function, I need code in the PP Code section that looks something like this:

 /* Set these to zero, in case neither singular nor plural are defined */
 curr_rop = orig_rop = 0;
 if (hv_exists(arg_hash_hv, "rops", 4)) {
     prop_list[n_props++] = rops_prop_id;
     curr_rop = orig_rop = my->get_rop(widget_handle);
 }
 if (hv_exists(arg_hash_hv, "rop", 3)) {
     orig_rop = my->get_rop(widget_handle);
     curr_rop = SvIV(*(hv_fetch(arg_hash_hv, "rop", 3, 0)));
     my->set_rop(widget_handle, curr_rop);
 }

This code has three important parts. First, it sets both the current and the
original rop values to zero. If the user didn't pass in any either key,
these values will pass through the whole loop unchanged. At the end, all of
the properties are checked to see if their current and original values
differ and if so their original values are restored. As both the current
and original values are zero in the case of no associated keys, restoration
will not be necessary, and will not wastefully be performed.

The second important part is the plural key check. If the plural key exists,
its property id is added to the property list. The property list is consulted
on each pass through the threadloop and this value indicates that the rop
value needs to be checked. It also retrieves and stores the original rop
value. Notice that it stores the original rop value in the current rop value.
If somehow this is called on empty piddles, the threadloop will never execute
and then curr_rop will have the same value it had before entering the loop.
Setting the current to the original value helps prevent mayhem.

The third important part is the singular key check. If the singular key
exists, the original value is retrieved (as with the plural key). The value
associated with the singular key is also retrieved and set.

Some of the more complicated properties will need more complex initialization
code, in which case they will have to provide a value for the
C<%init_args_for> hash. It should follow the basic form provided above.

# Calling the setters #

=begin details

Once in the threadloop, each of the properties needs to be able to check if
a new value differs from the current value, and effect a change if so. This
is easy but repetitive code, so once again I generate it from the same list
of arguments as everything else. In what follows, I create a function that
generates these code fragments for me, or looks them up in a hash if they're
complicated. Note that the function wraps the looked-up code in its own
curly-braced block; all you need to write is the code itself like the
following colors example shows:

The auto-generated code for this section is inserted directly into the
Code key in the pp_def function call, within the threadloop, before the
actual drawing function is called. For example:

 q[
     ...
     threadloop %{
		 /* Apply any per-threadloop tweaks */
         ] . generate_switch_loop_for(@func_pars)
         . q[
         /* Call the apricot function */

# Argument processing, ordering, and default handling #
#######################################################

=begin details

Each of the perl-side functions that gets invoked as an object
method checks its arguments. It does this by analyzing the hash sent in
by the caller, checking for properties that don't belong, or were
mis-spelled, and repackaging the results into a list with the exact
order needed by the PP code. Most parameters take a single piddle as
their argument, but some don't. This code needs to know how many
arguments go with each parameter, so it can check that, too. Such a list
of parameters can be automatically constructed from the already-defined
%pars_args_for hash.

=end details

=cut

pp_addpm (join("\n"
	, '# This is a list of the number of arguments for each property. It is based on the'
	, '# pars_args_for hash which is built in the .pd file associated with this module'
	, 'my %N_args_for = qw('
	# Note that the tr operator, as used, just counts the number of semi-colons
	# in the pars args associated with the property.
	, (map {sprintf "\t%-20s %d", $_, ($pars_args_for{$_} =~ tr/;//) + 1}
		(keys %pars_args_for))
	, ');'
	)
);

=begin details

Having collected the number of arguments associated with each of the
properties, I need a function to actually process the hash.
This is a function that I call in all of my PMCode sections. It takes an
anonymous list of names and an anonymous hash. If the hash has a key for
one of the names, it includes that in the return list. If it doesn't, it
returns the default value of a 0-dim piddle with a value corresponding to
the widget's handle. If one of the hash keys is not in the list of names,
it croaks.

Put a little differently, this function takes an anonymous hash, makes
sure there are no extraneous arguments, extracts the desired arguments
or uses a sensible default, and returns the arguments in the desired
order.

This code is very dense. I hope that it is documented well enough with
comments that any future maintainer will be able to understand it. If

a little test script and try calling it with sample parameters to get a

At last I begin the declaration of PP code. The idea behind all of this
machinary is that I declare a collection of applicable properties in
THIS SCRIPT, and then use that to generate consistent code blocks. I
even use the properties array to generate compile-time accurate
documentation, so the on-machine documentation can never go out-of-sync
with the on-machine library.

=for sig

  Prima Signature: (widget; x(); y(); x_diameter(); y_diameter();
                     start_angle(); end_angle(); properties)

=for ref

Draws arcs, i.e. incomplete ellipses.

Applicable properties include colors, backColors,
linePatterns, lineWidths, rops, rop2s.

The arcs go from the C<start_angle>s to the C<end_angle>s along the
ellipses centered at the C<x>s and C<y>s, with the specified x- and
y-diameters. The angles are measured in degrees, not radians.
The difference between this command and L</pdl_chords> or L</pdl_sectors> is that
C<pdl_arcs> does not connect the dangling ends.

Here's a simple example:

=for example

 # Draw a bunch of random arcs on $canvas:
 my $N_arcs = 20;
 my ($x_max, $y_max) = $canvas->size;
 my $xs = zeroes($N_arcs)->random * $x_max;
 my $ys = $xs->random * $y_max;
 my $dxs = $xs->random * $x_max / 4;
 my $dys = $xs->random * $y_max / 4;
 my $th_starts = $xs->random * 360;
 my $th_stops = $xs->random * 360;

 # Now that we've generated the data, call the command:
 $canvas->pdl_arcs($xs, $ys, $dxs
                , $dys, $th_starts, $th_stops);

If you put that snippet of code in the C<onPaint> method, as
suggested in the synopsis, a completely new set of arcs will get
redrawn whenever you resize your window.

Compare to the Prima method L<Prima::Drawable/arc>. Closely related
routines include L</pdl_chords> and L</pdl_sectors>. See also
L</pdl_fill_chords>, and L</pdl_fill_sectors>, L</pdl_ellipses>, and

Spline drawing provides a similar functionality, though more complex and

To draw circles, just use the same x- and y-diameter.

 my $y = $height/2;
 # Use the same x-diameter
 my $x_diameter = 15;
 # Increase the y-diameter
 my $y_diameter = $x->xlinvals(10, $height/1.3);

 # Use the pdl_ellipses method to draw!
 $canvas->pdl_ellipses($x, $y, $x_diameter, $y_diameter, lineWidths => 2);

=for ref

Draws filled ellipses (see L</pdl_ellipses>).

Applicable properties include colors, backColors, clipRects,
fillPatterns, rops, rop2s. 

=for example

 # Draw increasingly taller ellipses along the center line
 my $N_ellipses = 10;
 my ($width, $height) = $canvas->size;
 # horizontal positions evenly spaced
 my $x = (sequence($N_ellipses) + 0.5) * $width / $N_ellipses;
 # Vertically, right in the middle of the window
 my $y = $height/2;
 # Use the same x-diameter
 my $x_diameter = 15;
 # Increase the y-diameter
 my $y_diameter = $x->xlinvals(10, $height/1.3);

 # Use the pdl_ellipses method to draw!
 $canvas->pdl_fill_ellipses($x, $y, $x_diameter, $y_diameter);

If you resize the window the distance between the ellipses
and the ellipse heights will adjust automatically.

Compare to the Prima method L<Prima::Drawable/fill_ellipse>. The unfilled
equivalent is L</pdl_ellipses>. Closely related to L</pdl_fill_chords> and

# prima_fillpolys #

=head2 pdl_fillpolys

  Prima Signature: (widget; x(n); y(n); properties)

=for ref

Draws and fills a polygon with (mostly) arbitrary edge vertices.

Applicable properties include colors, backColors, clipRects,
fillPatterns, fillModes, rops, rop2s.

NOTE: there is B<no> underscore between C<fill> and C<poly>, which is
different from the other C<fill> methods!

This is useful for drawing arbitrary filled shapes and for visualizing
integrals. Splines would be the better choice if you want to draw curves, but
a PDL interface to splines is not (yet) implemented.

Unlike most of the other methods, this one actually makes a half-hearted
effort to process bad values. In addition to the IEEE bad values of C<nan>
and C<inf>, PDL has support for bad values. Unlike in C<pdl_polys>,
C<pdl_fillpolys> will simply skip any point that is marked as bad, but drawing
the rest of the polygon. In other words, it reduces the degree of your polygon
by one. If you sent it four points and one of them was bad, you would get a
triangle instead of a quadralaters.

Infinities are also handled, though not perfectly. There are a few
situations where C<pdl_polys> will correctly draw what you mean but
C<pdl_fillpolys> will not.

Because this skips bad data altogether, if you have too much bad data
(i.e. fewer than three good points), the routine will simply not draw
anything. I'm debating if this should croak, or at least give a warning.
(Of course, a warning to STDOUT is rather silly for a GUI toolkit.)

For example:

=for example

 # Create a poorly sampled sine-wave
 my ($width, $height) = $canvas->size;
 my $x = sequence(23)/4;
 my $y = $x->sin;

 # Draw it in such a way that it fits the canvas nicely
 $canvas->pdl_fillpolys($x * $width / $x->max,
     ($y + 1) * $height / 2, fillModes => fm::Winding,
 );

Resizing the window will result in a similar rendering that fits the aspect
ratio of your (resized) window.

  Prima Signature: (widget; x(); y(); x_diameter(); y_diameter();
                          start_angle(); end_angle(); properties)

=for ref

Draws filled sectors, i.e. a pie-slices or Pac-Mans.

Applicable properties include colors, backColors, clipRects,
fillPatterns, rops, rop2s.

More specifically, this draws an arc from C<start_angle> to C<end_angle>
along the ellipse centered at C<x>, C<y>, with specified x- and y-diameters.
Like L</pdl_fill_chords>, this command connects the end points of the arc, but
unlike L</pdl_fill_chords>, it does so by drawing two lines, both of which
also connect to the ellipse's center. This results in shapes that look
like pie pieces or pie remnants, depending of whether you're a glass-half-full
or glass-half-empty sort of person.

=for example

 # Draw a bunch of random arcs on $canvas:
 my $N_chords = 20;
 my ($x_max, $y_max) = $canvas->size;
 my $xs = zeroes($N_chords)->random * $x_max;
 my $ys = $xs->random * $y_max;
 my $dxs = $xs->random * $x_max / 4;
 my $dys = $xs->random * $y_max / 4;
 my $th_starts = $xs->random * 360;
 my $th_stops = $xs->random * 360;

 # Now that we've generated the data, call the command:

=head2 pdl_flood_fills

  Prima Signature: (widget; x(); y(); fill_color();
                   singleborder(); properties)

=for ref

Fill a contiguous region.

NOTE THIS MAY NOT WORK ON MACS! There seems to be a bug in either Prima or
in Mac's X-windows library that prevents this function from doing its job as
described. That means that flood filling is not cross-platform, at least not
at the moment. This notice will be removed from the latest version of this
documentation as soon as the item is addressed, and it may be that your
version of Prima has a work-around for this problem. At any rate, it only
effects Mac users.

Applicable properties include colors, backColors, clipRects,
fillPatterns, rops, rop2s.

Note that C<fill_color> is probably B<not> what you think it is. The
color of the final fill is determined by your C<colors> property. What,
then, does C<fill_color> specify? It indicates how Prima is supposed to
perform the fill. If C<singleborder> is zero, then C<fill_color> is the
color of the B<boundary> to which Prima is to fill. In other words, if you had
a bunch of intersecting lines that were all red and you wanted the interior
of those intersecting lines to be blue, you would say something like

 $widget->pdl_flood_fills($x, $y, cl::Red, 0, colors => cl::Blue);

On the other hand, if C<singleborder> is 1, then the value of C<fill_color>
tells Prima to replace every contiguous pixel B<of color> C<fill_color> with
the new color specified by C<colors> (or the current color, if no C<colors>
piddle is given).

=for example

 # Generate a collection of intersecting
 # circles and triangles
 my ($width, $height) = $canvas->size;
 my $N_items = 20;
 my $x = random($N_items) * $width;
 my $y = random($N_items) * $width;
 $canvas->pdl_ellipses($x, $y, 20, 20, lineWidths => 3);
 $canvas->pdl_symbols($x, $y, 3, 0, 0, 10, 1, lineWidths => 3);

 # Fill the interior of those circle/triangle intersections
 $canvas->pdl_flood_fills($x, $y, cl::Black, 0);

If you put that snippet of code in the example from the synopsis, you should
see a number of narrow rectangles intersecting circles, with the interior of
both shapes filled. Resizing the window will lead to randomly changed
positions for those space-ship looking things.

In contrast to polylines, which are supposed to be connected, these

  Prima Signature: (widget; x(n); y(n); properties)

=for ref

Draws a multi-segment line with the given x- and y-coordinates.

Applicable properties include colors, backColors, clipRects,
lineJoins, linePatterns, lineWidths, rops, rop2s.

This method goes to great lengths to Do What You Mean, which is actually
harder than you might have expected. This is the backbone for the Lines
plot type of L<PDL::Graphics::Prima>, so it needs to be able to handle all
manner of strange input. Here is what happens when you specify strange
values:

=over

=item IEEE nan or PDL Bad Value

If either of these values are specified in the middle of a line drawing, the
polyline will completely skip this point and begin drawing a new polyline at
the next point.

=item both x and y are inf and/or -inf

There is no sensible way of interpreting what it means for both x and y to
be infinite, so any such point is skipped, just like nan and Bad.

=item either x or y is inf or -inf

If an x value is infinite (but the paired y value is not), a horizontal line
is drawn from the previous x/y pair out to the edge of a widget; another line
is drawn from the edge to the next x/y pair. The behavior for an infinite y
value is similar, except that the line is drawn vertically.

For example, the three points (0, 1), (1, 1), (2, inf), (3, 1), (4, 1) would
be rendered as a line from (0, 1) to (1, 1), then a vertical line straight
up from (1, 1) to the upper edge of the widget or clipping rectangle, then
a vertical line straight down to (3, 1) from the upper edge of the widget or
clipping rectangle, then a horizontal line from (3, 1) to (4, 1).

=item x and/or y is a large value

If x or y is a large value (say, both x and y are 5e27 when the rest of your
numbers are of the order of 100), it will not be possible to actually show a
renderin of a line to that point. However, it is possible to correctly render
the slope of that point out to the edge of the clipping rectangle. Thus the
slope of the line from within-clip points to large values is faithfully
rendered.

=back

Here's an example of how to plot data using C<pdl_polylines> (though you'd
do better to use L<PDL::Graphics::Prima> to create plots):

=for example

 # Draw a sine curve on the widget:
 my $x = sequence(200);
 my $y = ( sin($x / 20) + 1 ) * 50;
 $canvas->pdl_polylines($x, $y);

=head2 pdl_rectangles

  Prima Signature: (widget; x1(); y1(); x2(); y2(); properties)

=for ref

Draws a rectangle from corner (x1, y1) to corner (x2, y2).

Applicable properties include colors, backColors, clipRects,
linePatterns, lineWidths, rops, rop2s.

=for example

 # Draw 20 random rectangles on $canvas:
 my $N_bars = 20;
 my ($x_max, $y_max) = $canvas->size;
 my $x1s = zeroes($N_bars)->random * $x_max;
 my $y1s = $x1s->random * $y_max;
 my $x2s = $x1s + $x1s->random * ($x_max - $x1s);
 my $y2s = $y1s + $x1s->random * ($y_max - $y1s);
 my $colors = $x1s->random * 2**24;

 # Now that we've generated the data, call the command:
 $canvas->pdl_rectangles($x1s, $y1s, $x2s, $y2s
         , colors => $colors);

If you put that snippet of code in the C<onPaint> method, as
suggested in the synopsis, a completely new set of rectangles
will get redrawn whenever you resize your window.

Compare to the Prima method L<Prima::Drawable/rectangle>. See also
L</pdl_bars>, which is the filled equivalent, and L</pdl_lines>, which
draws a line from (x1, y1) to (x2, y2) instead. Also, there is a Prima
method that does not (yet) have a pdl-based equivalent known as
L<Prima::Drawable/rects3d>, which draws beveled edges around a rectangle.

=head2 pdl_sectors

  Prima Signature: (widget; x(); y(); x_diameter(); y_diameter(); start_angle(); end_angle(); properties)

=for ref

Draws the outlines of sectors, i.e. a pie-slices or Pac-Mans.

Applicable properties include colors, backColors, clipRects,
linePatterns, lineWidths, rops, rop2s.

More specifically, this draws an arc from C<start_angle> to C<end_angle>
along the ellipse centered at C<x>, C<y>, with specified x- and y-diameters.
Like L</pdl_fill_chords>, this command connects the end points of the arc, but
unlike L</pdl_fill_chords>, it does so by drawing two lines, both of which
also connect to the ellipse's center. This results in shapes that look
like pie pieces or pie remnants, depending of whether you're a glass-half-full
or glass-half-empty sort of person.

=for example

 # For this example, you will need:
 use PDL::Char;

 # Draw a bunch of random sectors on $canvas:
 my $N_chords = 20;
 my ($x_max, $y_max) = $canvas->size;
 my $xs = zeroes($N_chords)->random * $x_max;
 my $ys = $xs->random * $y_max;
 my $dxs = $xs->random * $x_max / 4;
 my $dys = $xs->random * $y_max / 4;
 my $th_starts = $xs->random * 360;
 my $th_stops = $xs->random * 360;

 # make a small list of patterns:
 my $patterns_list = PDL::Char->new(
          [lp::Solid, lp::Dash, lp::DashDot]);

 # Randomly select 20 of those patterns:
 my $rand_selections = ($xs->random * 3)->byte;
 use PDL::NiceSlice;
 my $patterns = $patterns_list($rand_selections)->transpose;

 # Now that we've generated the data, call the command:
 $canvas->pdl_sectors($xs, $ys, $dxs
                , $dys, $th_starts, $th_stops
                , linePatterns => $patterns);

Compare to the Prima method L<Prima::Drawable/sector>. The filled equivalent
is L</pdl_fill_sectors>. There is a whole slew of arc-based drawing methods
including L</pdl_arcs>, L</pdl_chords>, and L</pdl_ellipses> along with their
filled equivalents. You may also be interested in L<Prima::Drawable/spline>,
which does not yet have a PDL interface.

=head2 pdl_symbols

  Signature: (widget; x(); y(); N_points(); orientation(); filled(); size(); skip(); properties)

=for ref

Draws a wide variety of symbols centered at (x, y).

Applicable properties include colors, backColors, clipRects, fillPatterns,
fillModes, linePatterns, lineWidths, rops, rop2s.

Through various combinations of C<N_points>, C<filled>, and C<skip>, you can
generate many different regular symbols, including dashes, stars, asterisks,
triangles, and diamonds. You can also specify each symbol's C<size> and
C<orientation>. The size is the radius of a circle that would circumscribe
the shape. The orientation is... well... just keep reading.

The shape drawn depends on C<N_points>. If C<N_points> is:

=over

=item zero or one

This will draw a circle with a radius of the
given size. The circle will be filled or not based on the value passed for
C<filled>, but the C<orientation> and C<skip> parameters are ignored. This
is almost redundant compared with the ellipse functions, except that this
arrangement makes it very easy to thead over filled/not-filled, and you
cannot specify an eccentricity for your points using C<pdl_symbols>.

=item two

This will draw a line centered at (x, y) and with a length of 2*C<size>.
The C<orientation> is measured in degrees, starting from horizontal, with
increasing angles rotating the line counter-clockwise. The value for C<skip>
is ignored.

This is particulary useful for visualizing slope-fields (although calculating
the angles for the slope field is surprisingly tricky).

=item three or more

This will draw a shape related to a regular polygon with the specified
number of sides. Precisely what kind of polygon it draws is based on the
value of C<skip>. For example, a five-sided polygon with a C<skip> of one
would give you a pentagon:

=for podview </cut>

In summary, a C<skip> of zero gives you an N-asterisk. A C<skip> of one gives
you a regular polygon. A C<skip> of two gives you a star. And so forth.
Higher values of C<skip> are allowed; they simply add to the winding behavior.

Specifying the orientation changes the position of the first point and,
therefore, all subsequent points. A positive orientation rotates the first
point counter-clockwise by the specified number of degrees. Obviously, due
to the symmetry of the shapes, rotations of 360 / N_points look identical to
not performing any rotation.

For all nonzero values of C<skip>, specifying a fill will end up with
a filled shape instead of a line drawing.

=back

By default, filled stars and other symbols with odd numbers of points have a
hole in their middle. However, Prima provides a means for indicating that you
want such shapes filled; that is the C<fillMode> property. As with almost all
graphical properties, you can specify the C<fillMode> property for each
symbol by specifying the C<fillMode> piddle to one of C<fm::> constants.

This example creates a table of shapes. It uses an argument from the command
line to determine the line width.

=for example

 use PDL::NiceSlice;

 # Generate a table of shapes:
 my @dims = (40, 1, 30);
 my $N_points = xvals(@dims)->clump(2) + 1;
 my $orientation = 0;
 my $filled = yvals(@dims)->clump(2) + 1;
 my $size = 10;
 my $skip = zvals(@dims)->clump(2);
 my $x = $N_points->xvals * 25 + 25;
 my $y = $N_points->yvals * 25 + 25;
 my $lineWidths = $ARGV[0] || 1;

 # Draw them:
 $canvas->pdl_symbols($x, $y, $N_points, 0, $filled, 10, $skip

=for bad

Bad values are handled by C<pdl_symbols>. If any of the values you pass in
are bad, the symbol is not drawn at that x/y coordinate.

=item Bad Value Support

Bad values are handled decently in L</pdl_polylines> and L</pdl_fillpolys>, but not for
the other functions. Bad x/y values should be skipped for almost all the drawing
primitives, but what about bad colors for valid coordinates? I could not draw
the primitive, defer to the widget's default color, or use the value associated
with the singular key (i.e. C<color>). But I haven't decided which of these is
best.

=head1 SEE ALSO

Some useful PDL/Prima functions are defined in L<PDL::Drawing::Prima::Utils>,
especially for converting among simple color formats.

This is built as an extension for the Prima toolkit, http://www.prima.eu.org/, L<Prima>.

This is built using (and targeted at users of) the Perl Data Language, L<PDL>.

This is the bedrock for the plotting package L<PDL::Graphics::Prima>.

Another interface between PDL and Prima is <PDL::PrimaImage>. I am indebted to
Dmitry for that module because it gave me a working template for this module,
including a working Makefile.PL. Thanks Dmitry!

# removes the stupid full-signature documentation.
# working here - this can be removed by properly handling the Doc key in the
# pp_def function call. When you supply an empty string, no documentation gets
# generated. That lets me to add my own pod in the PMCode section.
# However, I can skirt all of this by specifying the PdlDoc key with the
# exact documentation that I want. This wipes out all automatic documentation
# generation, but the trade-off might be worth it to avoid this code.

# However, I'm also going to add a 'use Prima' at the top for Windows machines,
# so I'm going to keep this section, even if I reduce the pod-parsing portion.
