1.0 2008.06.19
	- Empty tags are handled like they should be.  This should make it

	  observed behavior.
	- Use "vars" pragma instead of "our" for Perl 5.005.
	- Check for undefined values in the extended_link_delimiters field and
	  warn but ignore when found (fixes rt.cpan.org #26879).
	- Use uri_escape_utf8 unless charset is set to something other than
	  utf-8 in the options hash (fixes rt.cpan.org #26880).
	- Documentation fixes.

0.06 2008.06.17
	- Tests skip HTML processing when HTML::Parser and HTML::Tagset are
	  not installed.
	- format() actually processes the options hash.
	- Change _clone to Return arrays and a deep copy of hashes. 
	  Rather than a copy of arrays.

0.05 2006.09.28
	- Remove the <> when linkifying <http://absolute.link>.

0.04 2006.09.27
	- Process absolute links more robustly.

0.03 2006.09.27
	- Default to absolute_links => 1.
	- Prefer "our" to "use vars".

0.02 2006.09.26
	- Improved documentation.
	- Defaults to Mediawiki behaviors.

0.01 2006.0.20
	- Avoid applying wikification when block level allowed html elements
	  are present, when process_html option is set.
	- content of list items is now formatted by default.
	- (non)formatting of blocks is now configurable.
	- additional tests added, re RT 4700.
	- the $tags{link} func is now passed the tags hash, re RT 21393.
	- extended_link_delimiters may now be specified as a regex, re RT 21330.
	- merge_hash() now copies hashes.
	- several nesting bugs fixed, re RT 21269.
	- code refs now preserve indenting after the "  ", not before.
