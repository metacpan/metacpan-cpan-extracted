Revision history for Term-Terminfo

0.08    CHANGES:
         * Portability improvements to Build.PL configure test:
            + don't rely on linking to lib[n]curses for term.h test
            + try looking in /usr/include/ncurses to find term.h
           (thanks to Casey Zacek, RT 78155)

         * Optional support for unibilium in preference to term.h/-lcurses

           now
        BUGFIXES:
         * Don't rely on some BSD's (broken) idea of whether VT100 supports
           the 'xon' capability; try 'am' instead...

0.03    CHANGES:
         * Try to detect term.h and -lcurses in Build.PL; throw N/A instead of
           failure if not found

           output of `infocmp`
