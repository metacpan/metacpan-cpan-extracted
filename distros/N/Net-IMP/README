Net::IMP
IMP = Inspection and Modification Interface

This library provides a way to add inspection and modifications plugins
into existing data interceptors, e.g. proxies, intrusion detection
systems...

Contrary to ICAP (Internet Content Adaption Protocol, used mainly to add
content filtering to HTTP or mail) it is streaming aware, e.g. no need
to collect all data before inspection.

It is also performant because it has the ability to skip uninteresting
content or to pass a defined window of content before inspection, thus
keeping latencies small.

And it is callback driven, so no need to create a thread or process for
each connection. Thus it fits nicely to AnyEvent, POE...

Right now there are two sample users of the interface (see bin/ folder).
Also the interface will be integrated into the genugate high security
firewall (http://www.genua.de/produkte/genugate/index.en.html).
