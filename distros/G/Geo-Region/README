NAME

    Geo::Region - Geographical regions and groupings using UN M.49 and CLDR
    data

VERSION

    This document describes Geo::Region v0.07, built with Unicode CLDR v27.

SYNOPSIS

        use Geo::Region;
        use Geo::Region::Constant qw( :all );
    
        $amer = Geo::Region->new( AMERICAS );
        $emea = Geo::Region->new([ EUROPE, WESTERN_ASIA, AFRICA ]);
        $apac = Geo::Region->new([ ASIA, OCEANIA ], exclude => WESTERN_ASIA );
    
        if ( $amer->contains($country) ) {
            # country is in the Americas (US, MX, BR, etc.)
        }
        elsif ( $emea->contains($country) ) {
            # country is in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa (FR, SA, ZW, etc.)
        }
        elsif ( $apac->contains($country) ) {
            # country is in Asia-Pacific (JP, TH, AU, etc.)
        }

DESCRIPTION

    This class is used to create geographical regions and groupings of
    subregions and countries. Default regional groupings are provided using
    the Unicode CLDR v27 Territory Containment
    <http://unicode.org/cldr/charts/27/supplemental/territory_containment_u
    n_m_49.html> data, which is an extension of the United Nations UN M.49
    (Rev.3) <http://unstats.un.org/unsd/methods/m49/m49regin.htm> standard.

 Regions

    Regions and subregions are represented with UN M.49 region codes, such
    as 419 for Latin America and 035 for Southeast Asia. Either the
    official format using a three-digit 0-padded string like '035' or an
    integer like 35 may be used with this class. Note when using the
    0-padded format that it must be quoted as a string so as not to be
    treated as on octal literal. The CLDR also adds two additional
    two-letter region codes which are supported: EU for the European Union
    and QO for Outlying Oceania. These region codes are all available as
    constants in Geo::Region::Constant.

 Countries

    Countries and territories are represented with ISO 3166-1 alpha-2
    country codes, such as JP for Japan and AQ for Antarctica, and are case
    insensitive. Unlike with region codes, the three-digit forms of country
    codes are not currently supported, nor are three-letter codes. The
    deprecated code UK for the United Kingdom is supported as an alias of
    the official code GB.

 Constructor

    The new class method is used to construct a Geo::Region object along
    with the include argument and optional exclude argument.

    include

      Accepts either a single region code or an array reference of region
      or country codes to be included in the resulting custom region. When
      passed to the new constructor as the first or only argument, the
      value may be given without the include key.

          # countries in the European Union (EU)
          Geo::Region->new( include => EUROPEAN_UNION )
          Geo::Region->new( EUROPEAN_UNION )
      
          # countries in Asia (142) plus Russia (RU)
          Geo::Region->new( include => [ ASIA, RUSSIA ])
          Geo::Region->new([ ASIA, RUSSIA ])

    exclude

      Accepts values in the same format as include. This can be used to
      exclude countries or subregions from a region.

          # countries in Europe (150) which are not in the European Union (EU)
          Geo::Region->new( include => EUROPE, exclude => EUROPEAN_UNION )
          Geo::Region->new( EUROPE, exclude => EUROPEAN_UNION )

 Methods

    contains

      Given a country or region code, determines if the region represented
      by the Geo::Region instance contains it.

          if ( $region->contains($country) ) {

    is_within

      Given a region code, determines if all the countries and regions
      represented by the Geo::Region instance are within it.

          if ( $subregion->is_within($region) ) {

    countries

      Returns a list of country codes of the countries within the region
      represented by the Geo::Region instance.

          for ( $region->countries ) {
