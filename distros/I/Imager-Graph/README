What is it?
===========

Imager::Graph is intended to produce good looking graphs with a
minimum effort on the part of the user.  Hopefully I've managed that.

Currently only the pie graph class, Imager::Graph::Pie, is provided.


Fonts
=====

For best results you will need one or more attractive fonts, and one
of the outline font libraries that Imager supports.  The ImUgly font
is supplied with Imager::Graph, but it is fairly ugly, so probably
isn't useful if you want nice output.


Installation
============

Imager::Graph follows the normal perl module installation process:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

Please Note: don't be too suprised if you get test failures,
unfortunately minor changes in the image can result in large changes
in the measure I use to check the results.  If you get test failures
please check the results in testout/

The tests require PNG file format and TrueType font format support.

Creating Graphs
===============

The aim is to make things as simple as possible, if you have some data
you can create a pie chart with:

  use Imager::Graph::Pie;

  my $font = Imager::Font->new(file=>$fontfile)
    or die "Cannot create font: ",Imager->errstr;
  my $pie_graph = Imager::Graph::Pie->new();
  my $img = $pie_graph->draw(data=>\@data);

If you want to add a legend, you need to provide some descriptive text
as well:

  my $img = $pie_graph->draw(data=>\@data, labels=>\@labels, font=>$font,
                             features=>'legend');

You might want to add a title instead:

  my $img = $pie_graph->draw(data=>\@data, font=>$font, title=>'MyGraph');

or instead of a legend, use callouts to annotate each segment:

  my $img = $pie_graph->draw(data=>\@data, labels=>\@labels,
	                     features=>'allcallouts', font=>$font);

(The following graphs use features introduce after Imager 0.38.)

If you want draw a monochrome pie graph, using hatched fills, specify
the 'mono' style:

  my $img = $pie_graph->draw(data=>\@data, style=>'mono');

The 'mono' style produces a 1 channel image by default, so if you want
to add some color you need to reset the number of channels, for
example, you could change the drawing color to red:

  my $img = $pie_graph->draw(data=>\@data, style=>'mono', 
                             fg=>'FF0000', channels=>3);


If you're feeling particularly adventurous, you could create a graph
with a transparent background, suitable for compositing onto another
image:

  my $img = $pie_graph->draw(data=>\@data, style=>'mono', 
                             bg=>'00000000', channels=>4);

If you only want the background of the graph to be transparent, while leaving other parts of the chart opaque, use the back option:

  my $img = $pie_graph->draw(data=>\@data, style=>'mono', 
                             back=>'00000000', channels=>4);

or you could make the background an image based fill:

  my $img = $pie_graph->draw(data=>\@data, style=>'mono', channels=>4,
                             back=>{ image=>$otherimage } );

If you want a "prettier" image, you could use one of the fountain fill
based styles:

  my $img = $pie_graph->draw(data=>\@data, style=>'fount_lin');

The image you receive from Imager::Graph is a normal Imager image,
typically an 8-bit/sample direct color image, though options to extend
that may be introduced in the future.


Portability
===========

Imager::Graph should work on any system that Imager works on.
