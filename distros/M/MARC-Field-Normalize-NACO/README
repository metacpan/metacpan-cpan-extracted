NAME
    MARC::Field::Normalize::NACO - Matching normalization for MARC::Field

SYNOPSIS
      use MARC::Field;
      use MARC::Field::Normalize::NACO;

      my $field = MARC::Field->new(
          '100', ' ', ' ', a => 'Stephenson, Neal,', d => '1953-');
      my $normalized = $field->as_naco;
      my $custom = $field->as_naco(subfields => 'a');

DESCRIPTION
    MARC::Field::Normalize::NACO turns MARC::Field objects into strings
    canonicalized into NACO format. This makes them suitable for matching
    against an index of similarly normalized fields.

    The principal means of invoking is through the as_naco() method that the
    module injects into MARC::Field when loaded. A string is returned.

    This method takes an optional named parameter, subfields. The value of
    this parameter should be something that fits nicely into the regex
    qr/[$subfields]/, typically a range of letters. The default value is
    "a-z68".
