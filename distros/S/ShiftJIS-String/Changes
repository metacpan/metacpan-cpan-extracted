1.07  Fri Feb 19 22:32:39 2010
    - kana1.t: thank you CPAN testers! but parhaps I don't realize why
      it causes parse errors. I tried to tidy up the initialization.
    - added kana0.t using \xHH and with the same tests as kana1.t.

1.06  Wed Feb 17 22:02:43 2010
    - test: I don't know why kana.t sometimes fails...
            divided the old kana.t into 7 files (kana1.t to kana7.t)

1.03  Sat Apr 24 05:48:48 2004
    - test 22 in test.t is removed since the result of using a substr
      lvalue multiple times is fixed in perl 5.9.1.
    - POD in Japanese is renamed as JAPANESE.

1.02  Sun Jul 20 12:35:10 2003
    - changed INSTALLATION (cf. README).

      The purePerl-XSUB converter is now provided as two perl script files,
      named "enableXS" and "disableXS".
      (no longer <perl Makefile.PL xs> and <perl Makefile.PL noxs>.)

1.01  Tue Apr 29 10:49:07 2003

    - fix: With Perl 5.003, index and rindex were wrong
      when SUBSTR ends with \0.

1.00  Sat Sep 15 17:12:22 2002
    - strtr supports 'h' modifier (returns a hash or a hashref).
    - added POD in Japanese (see *.pod.jp)

0.20  Sat May 11 15:29:05 2002
    - added a new test, t/capture.t.
    - [XS] unreferenced local variables are removed.

0.16  Wed Jan 02 13:25:02 2002

      and strsplit().

0.15  Sun Dec 30 10:24:36 2001
    - bug fix (XS): when toupper, tolower, strrev had gotten
      a numeral (i.e. not a string), the program crashed!

0.14  Wed Dec 26 20:52:17 2001
    - Don't call strtr_light() by yourself! (XS version)
      But now checks TABLE briefly and croaks if weird.

0.13  Wed Dec 26 01:36:34 2001
    - performance of strtr() and trclosure() in XS is improved.

0.12  Mon Dec 24 17:57:11 2001
    - strtr() and trclosure() use XS when task is simpler,
      i.e. both SEARCHLIST and REPLACEMENTLIST are strings (not an arrayref),
       and neither PATTERN nor TOPATTERN are specified.
      ('n' modifier enforces to use the Non-XS subroutine.)
    - amplify tests and documents a bit.

0.11  Sun Dec 23 12:20:47 2001
    - an XS version and a Non-XS version are in the package.
    - reverse character ranges without confirmation (by a true 2nd argument
      for mkrange() or 'r' modifier for trclosure(), strtr()) are croaked.

    - improvement of internal.

0.09  Sun Sep 02 22:08:15 2001
    - bug fix: length, index, rindex passed "" as an argument.
    - prototypes: any parameters (excluding those of issjis)
      forces scalar context.
