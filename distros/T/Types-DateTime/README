NAME
    Types::DateTime - type constraints and coercions for datetime objects

SYNOPSIS
       package FroobleGala;
   
       use Moose;
       use Types::DateTime -all;
   
       has start_date => (
          is      => 'ro',
          isa     => DateTimeUTC->plus_coercions( Format['ISO8601'] ),
          coerce  => 1,
       );

DESCRIPTION
    Types::DateTime is a type constraint library suitable for use with
    Moo/Moose attributes, Kavorka sub signatures, and so forth.

  Types
    This module provides some type constraints broadly compatible with those
    provided by MooseX::Types::DateTime, plus a couple of extra type
    constraints.

    `DateTime`
        A class type for DateTime. Coercions from:

        from `Num`
            Uses "from_epoch" in DateTime. Floating values will be used for
            sub-second precision, see DateTime for details.

        from `HashRef`
            Calls "new" in DateTime or "from_epoch" in DateTime as
            appropriate, passing the hash as arguments.

        from `Now`
            Uses "now" in DateTime.

        from `InstanceOf['DateTime::Tiny']`
            Inflated using "DateTime" in DateTime::Tiny.

    `Duration`
        A class type for DateTime::Duration. Coercions from:

        from `Num`
            Uses "new" in DateTime::Duration and passes the number as the
            `seconds` argument.

        from `HashRef`
            Calls "new" in DateTime::Duration with the hash entries as
            arguments.

    `Locale`
        A class type for DateTime::Locale. Coercions from:

        from `Str`
            The string is treated as a language tag (e.g. `en` or `he_IL`) and
            given to "load" in DateTime::Locale.

        from `InstanceOf['Locale::Maketext']`
            The `Locale::Maketext/language_tag` attribute will be used with
            "load" in DateTime::Locale.

    `TimeZone`
        A class type for DateTime::TimeZone. Coercions from:

        from `Str`
            Treated as a time zone name or offset. See "USAGE" in
            DateTime::TimeZone for more details on the allowed values.

            Delegates to "new" in DateTime::TimeZone with the string as the
            `name` argument.

    `Now`
        Type constraint with only one allowed value, the string "now".

        This is exported for compatibility with MooseX::Types::DateTime, which
        exports such a constraint, even though it is not documented.

    `DateTimeWithZone`
        A subtype of `DateTime` for objects with a defined (non-floating) time
        zone.

        This type constraint inherits its coercions from `DateTime`.

    `DateTimeWithZone[`a]`
        The `DateTimeWithZone` type constraint may be parameterized with a
        DateTime::TimeZone object, or a string that can be coerced into one.

           has start_date => (
              is      => 'ro',
              isa     => DateTimeWithZone['Europe/London'],
              coerce  => 1,
           );

        This type constraint inherits its coercions from `DateTime`, and will
        additionally call "set_time_zone" in DateTime to shift objects into
        the correct timezone.

    `DateTimeUTC`
        Shortcut for `DateTimeWithZone["UTC"]`.

  Named Coercions
    It is hoped that Type::Tiny will help avoid the proliferation of modules
    like MooseX::Types::DateTimeX, MooseX::Types::DateTime::ButMaintained, and
    MooseX::Types::DateTime::MoreCoercions. It makes it very easy to add
    coercions to a type constraint at the point of use:

       has start_date => (
          is      => 'ro',
          isa     => DateTime->plus_coercions(
             InstanceOf['MyApp::DT'] => sub { $_->to_DateTime }
          ),
          coerce  => 1,
       );

    Even easier, this module exports some named coercions.

    `Format[`a]`
        May be passed an object providing a `parse_datetime` method, or a
        class name from the `DateTime::Format::` namespace (upon which `new`
        will be called).

        For example:

           DateTime->plus_coercions( Format['ISO8601'] )

        Or:

           DateTimeUTC->plus_coercions(
              Format[
                 DateTime::Format::Natural->new(lang => 'en')
              ]
           )

    `Strftime[`a]`
        A pattern for serializing a DateTime object into a string using
        "strftime" in DateTime.

           Str->plus_coercions( Strftime['%a %e %b %Y'] );

    `ToISO8601`
        A coercion for serializing a DateTime object into a string using
        "iso8601" in DateTime.

           Str->plus_coercions( ToISO8601 );
