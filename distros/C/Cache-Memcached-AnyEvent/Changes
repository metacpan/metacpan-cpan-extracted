    * Fix a problem with the regular server selection algorithm,
      where the insertion order of the servers would change which
      server gets selected. Reported by mdorman
    * Re-enable an object based server selector (Selector), so that
      the above change can be implemented cleanly

    * Rearrange tests
    * Text protocol delete() wasn't finding the correct server.

    * Some minor tweaks

0.00015 - 16 Mar 2010
    * Explicitly include Storable

0.00014 - 05 Mar 2010
    * Fix bad case of confess()
    * (Text protocol) Sometimes a GET just returns END... work around it

0.00013 - 25 Feb 2010
    * Fix t/100_commands.t -- if (1) you have EV.pm installed, AND (2)
      your memcached server does not understand binary protocol, then
      this test might fail with a segmentation fault. 
      This probably results from something in the cleanup that I'm missing
      to perform correctly, but I don't know what it is at the moment, so
      this test will force AnyEvent to use AnyEvent::Impl::Perl.
      If you have any pointers, patches are certainly appreciated!

0.00012 - 25 Feb 2010
    * Fix for when set operations (include set, add, and the like)
      might cause the client to stall. This only happens if you are using
      the text protocol.
    * Also, the paramter passed to these callbacks were bogus. That's been
      fixed too

0.00011 - 22 Feb 2010
