=head1 NAME

Chart::Plotly::Trace::Surface::Contours::Z - This attribute is one of the possible options for the trace surface.

=head1 VERSION

version 0.027

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Chart::Plotly qw(show_plot);
 use Chart::Plotly::Trace::Surface;
 use English qw(-no_match_vars);
 
 my $surface = Chart::Plotly::Trace::Surface->new(
     x => [ 0 .. 10 ],
     y => [ 0 .. 10 ],
     z => [
         map {
             my $y = $ARG;
             [ map { $ARG - $y * $y } ( 0 .. 10 ) ]
         } ( 0 .. 10 )
     ]
 );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This attribute is part of the possible options for the trace surface.

This file has been autogenerated from the official plotly.js source.

=head1 DISCLAIMER

This is an unofficial Plotly Perl module. Currently I'm not affiliated in any way with Plotly. 
But I think plotly.js is a great library and I want to use it with perl.
