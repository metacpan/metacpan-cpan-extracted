# Todo
#
#   The following represents a list of known bugs or limitations in
#   Text::MetaText, Text::MetaText::Directive and/or metapage or ideas
#   about ways in which they might be improved in the future.
#
#   The items are in no particular order and in many cases are abstract 
#   thoughts that drifted momentarily through my transem.  Most of those
#   points that indicate known bugs are due to be fixed some time soon.
#   The other ideas may or may not be implemented or re-worked in the 
#   fullness of time.
#
#========================================================================


#------------------------------------------------------------------------
# EVALUATE
#------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Check (and fix, if necessary) the evalutation code which uses string
  equalitites to compare variables.  This may fail in certain cases
  (e.g. "000123" > "45")

* _evaluate() uses a 2-step regex to strip surrounding quotes for rhs
  value (~ line 1489).  This may cause problems (false positive) when 
  quotes are mis-matched (e.g. 'foo")

* Enhance _evaluate() to understand "not" or "!"

* Make _evaluate() better, stronger and faster altogether.  It's 
  currently none of those (this is probably the next big task, BTW)


#------------------------------------------------------------------------
# NEW/IMPROVED DIRECTIVES
#------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Add conditional blocks:

  %% IF <condition> %% 
     ... 
  %% ELSE %% 
     ... 
  %% ENDIF %% 

* ...which may be more useful as %% SWITCH blocks %%

  %% SWITCH <var> %%
     -- <var> is true --
  %% CASE <value1> %%
     -- <var> == <value1> --
  %% CASE <value1> %%
     ...
  %% ENDSWITCH %%

  (might get really horrid if you wanted to do %% BREAK %% as well....

* Add for-loop blocks

  %% FOR <variable> = <start> to <end> step <step> %%
     ...
  %% ENDFOR %%

  Perhaps with a list of options, rather than a range:

  %% FOR <variable> = "<val1>, <val2>, <val3>, ... " %%
     ...
  %% ENDFOR %%

  or:

  %% FOR <variable> in "<val1>, <val2>, <val3>, ..." %%
     ...
  %% ENDFOR %%

* Add INDEX directive to build a list of existing INCLUDE (and others?)
  directives within a given document/block.  This should be available
  for use by the loop constructs.  Useful for making tables of contents/
  indices.

* Allow configuration items to be specified in directives
  e.g. %% CONFIGURE rogue="warn"     %%
       %% CONFIGURE magic="++"       %%
       ++ CONFIGURE delimiter="#"    ++ 
       ++ CONFIGURE magic="<!--#-->" ++ # uses DELIMITER

  This may have horrible security ramifications:

       %% CONFIGURE execute=all %%
       %% my_rogue_script("system -rf *") %%

* Add a facility to DEFINE global variables (global flag?) that persist 
  for the execution lifetime.  The namespace idea was a good one 
  (implemented internally, but removed for public release) but I 
  couldn't implement it well in the limited time I had available.

* Have failed INCLUDE directives warn/delete/rebuild directive like 
  SUBST does.

* Add "blockformat" parameter for formatting a block without splitting
  into lines and subsequently rejoining.


#------------------------------------------------------------------------
# VARIABLES AND CASE HANDLING
#------------------------------------------------------------------------

* System variables, such as "ELEMENT_NAME" that are set before, and cleared
  after process().  Currently, the only "system variable" is "TIME".

* Have a default (or user-defined) namespace which is searched for 
  variables as another SUBST option (as per EXECUTE).


#------------------------------------------------------------------------
# DOCUMENTATION
#------------------------------------------------------------------------

* update documentation to note that pre-defined (i.e. passed in the 
  process() variable hash) variables that resolve to code blocks 
  execute the code block in substitution.

* add a "tutorial" section to the docs, covering metapage in particular

* Update documentation to reflect any other new changes not listed above
  (there must be some kicking about)

* Add sections describing the use of ERROR and DEBUG.



#------------------------------------------------------------------------
# PARSE AND PROCESS METHODS
#------------------------------------------------------------------------

* process should also allow FileHandles to be passed.  Something like this 
  should do the trick for passing a filename, a GLOB or a FileHandle 
  reference.

	unless (ref($file) =~ /^(GLOB|FileHandle)$/) {
		$thingy = new FileHandle $file or return undef;
	}

	while (<$file>) {
	}

* Allow post-process methods to work on block text rather than line-by-line.

* _parse() and _process() should support _pre_parse(), _post_parse(),
  _pre_process() and _post_process() (not to be confused with the current 
  _post_process()) which can be hooks for derived classes.

* _push_process() and _pull_process() methods would make this runtime 
  configurable rather than requiring class derivation.

* Implement the base class with a _register_process() method which the
  constructor calls. 

  sub _register_processes {
      my $self = shift;
      $self->_push_process("if", PRE_PROCESS, 
             sub { $self->_evaluate(@_) });
      $self->_push_process("default", POST_PROCESS, 
             sub { $self->_default(@_) });
      # ...etc...
  }

* Derived classes can overload _register_processes() and call
  $self::SUPER->_register_processes() if they want to include 
  default processing capabilities.

  Or... if you wanted to provide a different default() method, you could 
  leave _register_processes() as it is and just overload _default().

* Things like default(), format() and filter() could be implemented as 
  _post_process() stages.  Perhaps if() could be implemented as a 
  _pre_process() stage.

  These should return 
    COMPLETE   - the process has handled the request in entirety
    CONTINUE   - the process may have done something but want to
                 pass control down the chain of responsibility
    CANCEL     - stop the request and return an empty result
    ERROR      - an error occurred.

* Add a Directive type, NULLOP, which is guaranteed to to nothing.  It
  escapes me at the moment why I wanted this, but it was going to be useful 
  for something or other.

* process_file() and process_text() currently return undef if the process
  fails.  This should be configurable (STRICT?) to allow the much simpler
  "print $mt->process_file(...)" rather than having to explicitly check
  the return value for undef before printing.


#------------------------------------------------------------------------
# ASSOCIATED PACKAGES
#------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Test ($ERROR) reporting in base class works effectively in derived
  classes.


#------------------------------------------------------------------------
# METAPAGE
#------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Add "alias" functionality to metapage (in [alias] config block?) which 
  defines an alias for one or more metapage configurations that should be 
  executed in turn.  e.g.

  .metapagerc
      [alias]
      kfs: kfs.text kfs.logfx kfs.higfx kfs.dhtml

  command line:
      metapage @kfs 
  ==> 
      metapage @kfs.text
      metapage @kfs.logfx
      metapage @kfs.higfx
      metapage @kfs.dhtml

* Add an execution option to metapage as per original mkpage utility.  This
  should be configurable to avert security issues.

  .metapagerc

      [file]
      bin = ~/metapage/bin

      [define]
      do_something = exec(script_name)

  Source file:
      %% do_something ... %% 
  ==>
      ~/metapage/bin/script_name ...

* Add a default "image" (or "img") block to metapage to facilitate:

  Source file:
      %% img foo/bar.gif
         alt = "My Image" 
      %% 
  ==>
      <img src="%%images%%/foo/bar.gif" 
      width="..." height="..." alt="My Image">

  Or:
      %% IMG $images/foo/bar.gif
         alt = "My Image"
      %%

* Implement metapage config management with App::Config?

* Extend config parsing capabilities to allow multiple options to be 
  specified (e.g. CASEVARS).

* Add a 'copy' option to config [file] block which specified a file pattern
  for files to be copied rather than processed.

* Implement the core metapage functionality as a module.  
  


#------------------------------------------------------------------------
# INSTANTIATION AND CONFIGURATION
#------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Is it necessary/worthwhile to allow instantiation via new() as an 
  object method as well as a class method?

* Add a CACHE configuration option which determines if symbol table 
  entries should be cached or not.  Add a corresponding reset(), 
  clear_cache(), reset_globals(), or whatever method to clean down the 
  MetaText instantiation.  This is particularly relevant to persistant 
  Text::MetaText objects such as you might use in mod_perl.

* On that note, create a mod_perl module.


#------------------------------------------------------------------------
# MISC INTERNALS
#------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Implement DEBUG better.  One idea is to alias the DEBUG function to 
  a nullop constant function (e.g. \*DEBUG = \&NULLOP;) which would 
  avoid the overhead of calling the DEBUG function and evaluating the 
  DEBUGLEVEL when DEBUG is turned off.  

* The sprintf in the DEBUG method gets confused by embedded '%' (line ~1507)

* It would be convenient for DEBUG and ERROR (and anthing else) to be
  shared between Text::MetaText and Text::MetaText::Directive, rather
  than having one report the other and so on.  These could be implemented
  as separate objects and passed from one to the other, perhaps.
  
* Fix _all_ variable test bugs of the form "$foo = $2 || 'default'" which 
  will give a false negative when ($2 eq "0")
