NAME
    XML::PYX - XML to PYX generator

SYNOPSIS
      use XML::PYX;
      my $parser = XML::PYX::Parser->new;
      my $string = $parser->parsefile($filename);

DESCRIPTION
    After reading about PYX on XML.com, I thought it was a pretty
    cool idea, so I built this, to generate PYX from XML using perl.
    See http://www.xml.com/pub/2000/03/15/feature/index.html for an
    excellent introduction.

    The package contains 2 usable packages, and 3 utilities that are
    probably currently more use than the module:

            pyx - a XML to PYX converter using XML::Parser
            pyxv - a Validating XML to PYX converter using XML::Checker::Parser
            pyxw - a PYX to XML converter
            pyxhtml - an HTML to PYX converter using HTML::TreeBuilder

    All these utilities can be pipelined together, so you can have:

            pyx test.xml | grep -v "^-" | pyxw > new.xml

    Which should remove all text from an XML file (leaving only
    tags).

    The 2 packages are XML::PYX::Parser and XML::PYX::Parser::ToCSF.
    The former is a direct subclass of XML::Parser that simply
    returns a PYX string on a call to parse or parsefile. The latter
    stands for To Currently Selected Filehandle. Instead of
    returning a string, it sends output directly to the currently
    selected filehandle. This is much better for pipelined utilities
    for obvious reasons.

    There's a special variable: $XML::PYX::Lame. Set it to 1 to use
    a "Lame" parser that simply uses regexps. This is useful, for
    example, if you are changing the input to invalid XML for some
    reason. You can then use $XML::PYX::Lame = 1 to enable the non-
    xml parser. It does check for some things, like balanced tags,
    but otherwise it's pretty lame :)

    Lame mode is enabled for pyx and pyxw with the -l option.
