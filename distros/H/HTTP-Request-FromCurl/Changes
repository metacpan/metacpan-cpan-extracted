0.18 2020-09-30
    * Add support for --data-raw, --data-ascii, --data-binary, --data-urlencode
    * --data now strips newlines and linefeeds, as does curl
    * Filter::signatures prerequisite is now 0.16

0.17 2020-04-13
    * Test suite changes to fix Redhat test failures
    * No code changes, no need to upgrade

0.16 2020-04-12
    * (Hopefully) fix one more test inconsistency
    * Add ->as_curl method for round-tripping/canonicalizing curl invocations
      This also means you can now convert from fetch() to curl invocations
    * The --user-agent is now correctly recognized

0.15 2020-04-10
    * Fix the test suite for longish curl version strings
      This addresses RT #127641 , as reported by SREZIC
    * Also require HTTP::Request::Generator 0.09 , which handles IPv6.

0.14 2020-04-09
    * Added ::FromFetch to convert data from the Javascript Fetch API
    * GET requests without headers now create valid Perl code

    * Support output of HTTP::Tiny code in addition to LWP::UserAgent
    * Support headers with multiple values
    * Test suite can now run in parallel, cutting down test time
    * Test suite is now robust in face of features unsupported by the
      curl executable. --compress can be unimplemented.
    * Test suite is now robust in face of IPv6. Curl URL-globbing does not
      play well with IPv6 URLs.

0.12 2019-02-27
    * Fix the test skip count in the case we encountered an error earlier
      (Reported by SREZIC, addresses RT#128646)
    * Ignore warnings when running the code compilation tests

0.11 2019-02-26

      as if it were to be interpolated into Perl code even when it was
      handed to ->as_request.

    * Sequence expansion
      Curl and this module now support specifying sequences of URLs such as
      C< https://example.com/[1-100] > , which expands to
      C< https://example.com/1 >, C< https://example.com/2 > ...
      C< https://example.com/100 >

      Such sequences are expanded in-memory at this time, courtesy of
      Cartesian Products

    * List expansion

      Curl supports specifying sequences of URLs such as
      C< https://{www,ftp}.example.com/ > , which expands to
      C< https://www.example.com/ >, C< https://ftp.example.com/ >.

      Such sequences are expanded in-memory at this time, courtesy of
      Cartesian Products
    * Added option to limit the number of expanded requests
    * Added ->clone() method to HTTP::Request::CurlOptions
    * We now need HTTP::Request::Generator 0.06, for bug fixes in URL generation
      in that module
