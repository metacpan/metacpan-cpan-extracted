This module wraps the long double complex arithmetic functions defined in complex.h.
Consequently, you need a C compiler that provides complex.h.

Build in the usual way:

 perl Makefile.PL
 make
 make test
 make install


=====================
Which Math::Complex_C
=====================

There are three Math::Complex_C modules, each now in it's own separate distro:

1) Math::Complex_C
  Accesses C's 'double' precision (53-bit) complex arithemtic operations;

2) Math::Complex_C::L
  Accesses C's 'long double' precision (usually 64-bit) complex arithemtic operations;

3) Math::Complex_C::Q
  Accesses C's '__float128' precision (113-bit) complex arithemtic operations;

You can use any/all of those 3 modules (assuming they build ok for you) on any perl - irrespective
of whether your NV-type is 'double', 'long double' or '__float128' - though you need to go about
things a little judiciously if the precision of your NV is less than the precision of the complex
arithemtic operations for the Math::Complex_C module that you're using.

For example, if your NV is double, and you're using Math::Complex_C::Q:

########################

use warnings;
use Math::Complex_C::Q qw(:all);

$obj = sqrt(MCQ(-2.123, 0));
$nv = imag_cq($obj);     # returns NV
$str = imag_cq2str($obj);# returns string

print "$nv\n$str\n";

########################

This outputs:
1.45705181788432
1.45705181788431952124809953480556e+00

Clearly, you've lost the full __float128 precision by calling imag_cq(), whereas imag_cq2str()
allows you to capture the full precision.

But there's another loss of precision in the above. When the NV (bareword) -2.123 was assigned
it was assigned only with 'double' (53-bit) precision. Assigning the value with full 113-bit
precision is quite simple - we just have to quote the bareword '-2.123':

########################

use warnings;
use Math::Complex_C::Q qw(:all);

$obj = sqrt(MCQ('-2.123', 0));
$nv = imag_cq($obj);     # returns NV
$str = imag_cq2str($obj);# returns string

print "$nv\n$str\n";

########################

This doesn't change the value of $nv, but $str changes to:
1.45705181788431944566113502812563e+00

which is now (hopefully) the correct 33-digit approximation of sqrt(2.123).

Another alternative is to assign to a Math::Float128 object instead of to a string:

########################

use warnings;
use Math::Complex_C::Q qw(:all);
use Math::Float128 qw(:all);

$obj = sqrt(MCQ('-2.123', 0));
# $obj = sqrt(MCQ(Math::Float128->new('-2.123'), 0)); # same result
$f128_obj = imag_cq2F($obj);# returns Math::Float128 object

print "$f128_obj\n";

########################

This also prints out:
1.45705181788431944566113502812563e+00

but this time the value is stored in a Math::Float128 object, not a string.
So ... just make sure that values are assigned/retrieved as either strings or Math::Float128 objects.
The capability for this is provided.
Similarly if you're using Math::Complex_C::L on a perl whose NV is 'double' - grab/assign
the values as either strings or Math::LongDouble objects.

For example, again with NV type of double:

##############################

use warnings;
use Math::Complex_C::L qw(:all);
use Math::LongDouble qw(:all);

$obj = sqrt(MCL('-2.123', 0));
# $obj = sqrt(MCL(Math::LongDouble->new('-2.123'), 0)); # same result
$nv = imag_cl($obj);       # returns NV
$str = imag_cl2str($obj);  # returns string
$ld_obj = imag_cl2LD($obj);# returns Math::LongDouble object

print "$nv\n$str\n$ld_obj\n";

##############################

This outputs:
1.45705181788432
1.45705181788431945e+000
1.45705181788431945e+000

If your NV precision matches the precision of the complex (real and imaginary) parts then
assigning/retrieving values as NVs is fine.

If your NV precision is greater than the precision of the complex components then you're simply
wasting the extra precision your NV has - which is something you are entirely free to do.

In short, I'd recommend using Math::Complex_C::Q - unless you have some reason to not do so.
Valid reasons would include not needing that level of precision or quadmath not being available
for your system.
