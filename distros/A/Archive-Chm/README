Archive::Chm version 0.06
====================

Archive::Chm is a module that provides access to Microsoft Compiled
HTML Help files (chm files). A lot of today's software ships with
documentation in .chm format. However Microsoft only provides
viewing tools for their own OS and the company doesn't disclose
the format specification.

Unofficial specs can be found at: http://www.speakeasy.org/~russotto/chm/chmformat.html

The module is basically a wrapper of Jed Wing's chmlib, a C library
that provides access to all ITSS archives, though .chm is the only
ITSS type file in use today.

Currently access to .chm files is read-only and this will change over
time if Jed Wing upgrades his library. Supported operations are getting
a listing of the contents, extracting one or all items in the archive
and retrieving an item's length.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install
   
Note: if you don't install it with root privilages, you might get an error after
make install, something like "Permission denied at /.../somefolder/.packlist".
Don't worry, it works, and I'm still trying to get to the bottom of this. Any
hints would be appreciated.
   
DEPENDENCIES

This module requires Jed Wing's chmlib, that can be found at the
following address: http://66.93.236.84/~jedwin/projects/chmlib/

You need to have it installed in a directory that ld knows about or 
modify Chm.pm before make, to load chmlib from the directory
you have installed it to, with the -Lyourlibdir flag.
