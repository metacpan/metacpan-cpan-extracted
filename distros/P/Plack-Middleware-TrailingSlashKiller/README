NAME
    Plack::Middleware::TrailingSlashKiller - Dealing with that pesky
    trailing slash/

SYNOPSIS
      builder {
        enable "TrailingSlashKiller",
          redirect => 1
      };

DESCRIPTION
    "Plack::Middleware::TrailingSlashKiller" will look for trailing slashes
    in the requested URL and remove them. Based on the "redirect" option, it
    will either redirect or silently rewrite the URL before passing it on to
    the app.

    This module was written with Dancer2 in mind, where "/path" and "/path/"
    are different (and the latter usually results in a 404).

PARAMETERS
    redirect
         This boolean will instruct the module to either return 301
         (GET/HEAD) and 307 (other) results with a Location header or to
         silently rewrite the URL without a trailing slash.
