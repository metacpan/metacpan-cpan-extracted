SYNOPSIS

    Install this distribution, then the lcpan subcommands below will be
    available:

     # List Acme::CPANLists modules available on CPAN
     % lcpan cpanlists-mods

DESCRIPTION

    This distribution packages several lcpan subcommands related to
    Acme::CPANLists. More subcommands will be added in future releases.

    Some ideas:

    cpanlists-stats. Number of modules. But we will want to also know the
    number of lists, total number of entries, average number of entries per
    list, average number of lists per modules.

    Perhaps an indexing hook could be added, so that lcpan indexes the
    lists themselves? To be safer, an Acme::CPANLists module could export
    the lists to a JSON, so lcpan does not have to load the module.

    The indexing part could be modularized, so we can have a SQLite
    database containing list information without having to have lcpan,
    because lcpan database is huge.

    Or (easier)... lcpan could just call this indexer. The cpanlists
    indexer indexes to a separate SQLite database. But note that the
    cpanlists indexer *will* eval/load the modules.
