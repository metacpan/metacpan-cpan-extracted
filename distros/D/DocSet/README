DESCRIPTION
    This package builds a docset from sources in different formats. The
    generated documents can be all nicely interlinked and to have the same
    look and feel.

    Currently it knows to handle input formats:

    * POD * HTML

    and knows to generate:

    * HTML * PS * PDF

  Modification control
    Each output mode maintains its own cache (per docset) which is used when
    certain source documents weren't modified since last build and the build
    is running in a non-force-rebuild mode.

  Definitions:
    * Chapter is a single document (file).

    * Link is an URL

    * Docset is a collection of docsets, chapters and links.

  Application Specific Features
    1   META: not ported yet!

        Generate a split version HTML, creating html file for each pod
        section, and having everything interlinked of course. This version
        is used best for the search.

    1   Complete the POD on the fly from the files in POD format. This is
        used to ease the generating of the presentations slides, so one can
        use "*" instead of a long =over/=item/.../=item/=back strings. The
        rest is done as before. Take a look at the special version of the
        html2ps format to generate nice slides in
        *conf/html2ps-slides.conf*.

    1   If you turn the slides mode on, it automatically turns the "-i" ("*"
        bullets preprocessing) mode and does a page break before each =head
        tag.

  Examples
    The package includes two fully working examples in the *examples/*
    directory.

    site
        This example demonstrates a shrinked version of perl.apache.org
        (which is genrated entirely by DocSet), with many docs removed or
        reduced to the mininumum. There are still quite a lot of documents
        left so you can see the big picture. Read *examples/site/README* for
        more information.

    presentation
        This example demonstrates how to build presentations handouts and
        slides using DocSet. Read *examples/presentation/README* for more
        information.

  Look-n-Feel Customization
    You can customise the look and feel of the ouput by adjusting the
    templates in the directory *examples/site/tmpl/custom*.

    You can change look and feel of the PS (PDF) versions by modifying
    *examples/site/conf/html2ps.conf*. Be careful that if your documentation
    that you want to put in one PS or PDF file is very big and you tell
    html2ps to put the TOC at the beginning you will need lots of memory
    because it won't write a single byte to the disk before it gets all the
    HTML markup converted to PS.

CONFIGURATION
    All you have to prepare is a single config file that you then pass as an
    argument to "docset_build":

      % docset_build [options] base_full_path relative_to_base_config_file_location

    Every directory in the source tree may have a configuration file, which
    designates a docset's root. See the *config* files for examples. Usually
    the file in the root (*examples/site/src*) sets operational directories
    and other arguments, which you don't have to repeat in sub-docsets. You
    want to redefine the build attributes in nested docsets if you want to
    override certain configuration attributes. Modify these files to suit
    your documentation project layout.

    Note that the smart *examples/site/bin/build* script automatically
    locates your project's directory, so you can move your project around
    filesystem without changing anything. So you really build with:

      % bin/build [options]

    *examples/site/README* explains the layout of the directories.

    "DocSet::Config" manpage explains the layout of the configuration file.

Extending
    Read the other manpages for more information about how to extend Docset.

PREREQUISITES
    The following are the optional prerequisites:

    * ps2pdf
        Needed to generate the PDF version.

    * Storable
        Available from CPAN (http://cpan.org/) and is a part of the core
        Perl distribution of the Perl 5.8.0 and higher.

        Allows source modification control, so if you modify only one file
        you will not have to rebuild everything to get the updated
        HTML/PS/PDF files.

SUPPORT
    Notice that this tool relies on two tools ("ps2pdf" and "html2ps") which
    I don't support, since I didn't write them. So if you have any problem
    first make sure that it's not a problem of these tools.

    Note that while "html2ps" is included in this distribution, it's written
    in the old style Perl, so if you have patches send them along, but I
    won't try to fix/modify this code otherwise. For more info see:
    http://www.tdb.uu.se/~jan/html2ps.html

BUGS
    Huh? Probably many...
