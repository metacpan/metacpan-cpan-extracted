NAME

    Bot::ChatBots - Basic system for ChatBots

VERSION

    This document describes Bot::ChatBots version 0.006.

SYNOPSIS

       use Bot::ChatBots;
       # more will come, possibly in sub-modules

DESCRIPTION

    The Bot::ChatBots family of modules aim to help setting up ChatBots in
    different technologies.

    The basic model (still somehow in a state of flux) is an extension of
    Data::Tubes, with a few differences:

      * pipelines in Data::Tubes are usually assumed to know where to take
      their inputs and aim at processing all of it as fast as possible,
      while in this case the it generally comes asynchronously and over an
      indefinite length of time. This means that the sources of records are
      usually coded differently and then push records inside pipelines as
      they arrive;

      * processing in Data::Tubes is generally synchronous for simplicity,
      while in this case you might have longer running tasks. This can be
      addressed in different ways, one of which might be to split your
      pipeline into chunks, and decouple these chunks via some queuing
      mechanism.

    Apart from this, the suggested way to use Bot::ChatBots elements is
    sticking to the Data::Tubes way of work: define your pipelines, reuse
    already-available tube builders or code your own adhering to the
    (simple) tube interface.

BUGS AND LIMITATIONS

    Report bugs either GitHub (patches welcome).
