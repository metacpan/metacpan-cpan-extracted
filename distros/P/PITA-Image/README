NAME
    PITA::Image - PITA Guest Manager for inside system images

SYNOPSIS
    A typical startup script

      #!/usr/bin/perl
      
  use strict;
      use IPC::Run3;
      use PITA::Image;
      
  # Wrap the main actions in an eval to catch errors
      eval {
          # Configure the image manager
          my $manager = PITA::Image->new(
              injector => '/mnt/hbd1',
              workarea => '/tmp',
          );
          $manager->add_platform(
              scheme => 'perl5',
              path   => '', # Default system Perl
          );
          $manager->add_platform(
              scheme => 'perl5',
              path   => '/opt/perl5-6-1/bin/perl'
          );
      
      # Run the tasks
          $manager->run;
      
      # Report the results
          $manager->report;
      };
      
  # Shut down the computer on completion or failure
      run3( [ 'shutdown', '-h', '0' ], \undef );
      
  exit(0);

    And a typical configuration image.conf

      class=PITA::Image
      version=0.10
      support=http://10.0.2.2/
      
  [ task ]
      task=Test
      scheme=perl5.make
      path=/usr/bin/perl
      request=request-512311.conf

DESCRIPTION
    While most of the PITA system exists outside the guest images and tries
    to have as little interaction with them as possible, there is one part
    that needs to be run from inside it.

    The "PITA::Image" class lives inside the image and has the
    responsibility of accepting the injector directory at startup, executing
    the requested tasks, and then shutting down the (virtual) computer.

Setting up a Testing Image
    Each image that will be set up will require a bit of customization, as
    the entire point of this type of testing is that every environment is
    different.

    However, by keeping most of the functionality in the "PITA::Image" and
    PITA::Scheme classes, all you should need to do is to arrange for a
    relatively simple Perl script to be launched, that feeds some initial
    configuration to to a new "PITA::Image" object.

    And it should do the rest.

METHODS
  new
      my $manager = PITA::Image->new(
          injector => '/mnt/hdb1',
          workarea => '/tmp',
      );

    The "new" creates a new image manager. It takes two named parameters.

    injector
        The required "injector" param is a platform-specific path to the
        root of the already-mounted /dev/hdb1 partition (or the equivalent
        on your operating system). The image configuration is expected to
        exist at image.conf within this directory.

    workarea
        The optional "workarea" param provides a directory writable by the
        current user that can be used to hold any files and do any
        processing in during the running of the image tasks.

        If you do not provide a value, "File::Temp::tempdir()" will be used
        to find a default usable directory.

    Returns a new "PITA::Image" object, or dies on error.
