Getopt-XML version 0.53
============================

This is simply another way to pass in user defined arguments to an application
using Getop::Long. The module provides a way to pass in user arguments from an
XML file into Getopt::Long.

In this way, the user can provide input to an application via an XML file. And
this can be useful if the application is ran at a regular interval. Or it may
be useful if the input to the application can change between multiple
executions, but the provided content is consistant over time based on the
context of the execution.

This input method may be desired for an application which has default values
for options the author wishes to exist, but the author wants those default
values to be changed by the user without having to edit the application code.

Or perhaps the application will reside in a multi-user environment, and this
module would be used to store the input options as part of the user preferences.

And finally, perhaps the options to be passed into the application resides
somewhere else in XML or another storage format that can be transformed into
XML as input to an application.


EXAMPLE

    use XML::TreePP;
    use Getopt::Long;
    use Getopt::XML qw(GetXMLOptions);
    use Data::Dump qw(dump);
    #
    # Set the XML Data
    my $xmldata=<<"EOF_XMLDATA";
    <apple>
        <color>red</color>
        <type>red delicious</type>
        <isAvailable/>
        <cityGrown>Macomb</cityGrown>
        <cityGrown>Peoria</cityGrown>
        <cityGrown>Galesburg</cityGrown>
    </apple>
    EOF_XMLDATA
    #
    # Parse the XML data using XML::TreePP module
    my $tpp     = XML::TreePP->new();
    my $tree    = $tpp->parse( $xmldata );
    #
    # Read the XML data in as arguments to Getopt::Long
    my %options;
    GetXMLOptions (
            xmldoc   => $tree,
            xmlpath  => 'apple',
            Getopt_Long     =>
            [
            \%options,
                    'isAvailable',
                    'color=s',
                    'type=s',
                    'cityGrown=s@'
            ]
    );
    dump(\%options);

This is the output:

    {
      cityGrown => ["Macomb", "Peoria", "Galesburg"],
      color => "red",
      isAvailable => 1,
      type => "red delicious",
    }
