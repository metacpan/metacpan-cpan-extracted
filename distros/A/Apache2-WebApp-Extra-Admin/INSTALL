Install this package from source:

  $ perl MakeFile.PL PREFIX=~/path/to/custom/dir LIB=~/path/to/custom/lib
  $ make
  $ make install


Perl one liner using CPAN.pm:

  $ perl -MCPAN -e 'install Apache2::WebApp::Extra::Admin'


Use of CPAN.pm in interactive mode:

  $ perl -MCPAN -e shell
  cpan> install Apache2::WebApp::Extra::Admin
  cpan> quit

Just like the manual installation of perl modules, the user may need root access
during this process to insure write permission is allowed within the intstallation
directory.


Install/Runtime issues (non-root)

Q. When running a script, I get the message "Can't locate loadable object for mod.."

A. Since you are an unpriviledged user, you aren't allowed to install modules into
   system directories.  In order to remedy this situation, you can install CPAN
   into your home directory.  Not only is this good practice (sandboxing), it
   will make it easier when installing other 3rd party CPAN modules in the future.

  $ perl -MCPAN -e shell

  cpan shell -- CPAN exploration and modules installation (v1.X)
  ReadLine support enabled

  cpan> o conf commit
