App-Toodledo

Toodledo (http://www.toodledo.com/) is a web-based capability for managing
to-do lists along Getting Things Done (GTD) lines.  This module
provides a Perl-based access to its API.  This is a complete rewrite to
version 2 of the API.

THIS MODULE IS NOT BACKWARDS COMPATIBLE WITH ANY PREVIOUS VERSIONS.

What do you need the API for?  Doesn't the web interface do everything
you want?  Not always.  See the examples included with this distribution.
For instance, Toodledo has only one level of notification and it's either
on or off.  With the API you can customize the heck out of notification.

INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install

	... or, just 'cpan App::Toodledo'

You can enable live tests by giving your Toodledo userid and password
on the first line:

        perl Makefile.PL --user_id td23943abe402  --password secret
