DESCRIPTION
    A Net::SNMP mixin class for mib-II ipRouteTable info.

MIXIN METHODS
  OBJ->get_ip_route_table()
    Returns the mib-II ipRouteTable as a list. Every route entry is a
    reference to a hash with the following fields and values:

      {
        ipRouteDest       => IpAddress,
        ipRouteMask       => IpAddress,
        ipRouteNextHop    => IpAddress,
        ipRouteIfIndex    => INTEGER,
        ipRouteMetric1    => INTEGER,
        ipRouteMetric2    => INTEGER,
        ipRouteMetric3    => INTEGER,
        ipRouteMetric4    => INTEGER,
        ipRouteMetric5    => INTEGER,
        ipRouteType       => INTEGER,
        ipRouteTypeString => String,   # resolved enum
        ipRouteProto      => INTEGER,
        ipRouteTypeProto  => String,   # resolved enum
        ipRouteAge        => INTEGER,
        ipRouteInfo       => OBJECT IDENTIFIER
      }
