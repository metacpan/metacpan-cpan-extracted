NAME
    Test::StructuredObject - Use a structured execution-graph to create a
    test object which runs your tests smartly.

VERSION
    version 0.01000010

SYNOPSIS
        use Test::More;
        use Test::StructuredObject;

        my $testsuite = testsuite(
            test { use_ok('Foo'); },
            test { is( Foo->value, 7, 'Magic value' },
            step { note "This is a step!"; }
            testgroup( 'This is a subtest' => (
                test { ok( 1, 'some inner test' ) },
                test { ok( 1, 'another inner test' ) },
            ))
        );

        # Employs Test::More's very recent 'subtest' call internally to do subtesting.

        $testsuite->run();

        # Flattens the subtests into a linear fashion instead, decorated with 'note''s  for older Test::More's
        $testsuite->linearize->run();

        # Prints a simplistic (non-reversable) serialisation of the testsuite or diagnostic purposes.
        print $testsuite->to_s;

DESCRIPTION
    This technique has various perks:

    1. No need to count tests manually
    2. Tests are still counted internally:
        Test harness can report tests that failed to run.

    3. Tests are collected in a sort of state-graph of sorts:
        This is almost A.S.T. like in nature, which permits various run-time
        permutations of the graph for different results.

    4. Every "test { }" closure is executed in an "eval { }":
        This makes subsequent tests not get skipped if one dies.

    5. Internal storage of many simple sub-calls:
        This allows reasonably good "Deparse" introspection, so if need be,
        the entire execution tree can easily be rewritten to be completely
        Test::StructuredObject free.

    However, it has various downsides, which for most things appear
    reasonable to me:

    1. Due to lots of closures:
        Due to this, the only present variable transience is achieved via
        external lexical variables.

        A good solution to this I've found is just pre-declare all your
        needed variables and pretend they're like CPU registers =).

    2. Closures break "->import" in many cases:
        Due to closure techniques, code that relies on "->import" to do
        lexical scope mangling may not work.

        That is pesky for various reasons, but on average its not a problem,
        as it is, existing Test files need that "BEGIN{ use_ok }" stuff to
        get around this issue anyway.

        But basically, all you need to do is 'use' in your file scope in
        these cases, or use Fully Qualified sub names instead.

        If neither of these solutions appeals to you, YOU DON'T HAVE TO USE
        THIS MODULE!.

EXPORTS
    This module exports the following symbols by default using
    "Sub::Exporter" , and as such, you can tweak and use export tunings as
    supported by that module.

    "test"
            test {  test_pragma }

        This method creates a "Test" object containing the given code. Code
        is run at run-time when called on the objects "->run" method. The
        code is run in an "eval" container and as such will not die. Deaths
        called inside the "eval" will merely be downgraded to warnings and
        passed to "carp". See the run documentation for details.

        This object type is recognised by containing types, and presence of
        such types increments the relevant number of planned tests at
        various levels.

    "step"
            step { code_step }

        This method is virtually identical to the "test" method except that
        the returned object is instead an "NonTest", and as such, containing
        types won't increment the test count when it is seen. It is advised
        you use this method for doing things that prepare data for the test,
        but don't actually do any testing. Additionally, it is advised to
        keep a 1-step-per-statement ratio, because I feel this may pay off
        one day when I get proper tree processing =).

    "testsuite"
            testsuite( Test|NonTest|SubTest, ....   )

        This method is just a sugar syntax to create a "TestSuite" instance.
        Its parameter list comprises of a list of either "Test", "NonTest"
        or "SubTest" instances.

        As a side perk, if you use the following notation instead:

            testsuite( name => (   Test | NonTest | SubTest, ...  ) )

        It will behave the same as "testgroup" does.

    "testgroup"
            testgroup( name => ( Test | NonTest | SubTest , ... ) )

        This method creates a structural subgroup of tests ("SubTest") with
        the given name. When the top "TestSuite" is executed in normal
        conditions, this runs each test of the "subtest" under
        "Test::More"'s '"subtest"' function creating pretty indented test
        TAP output.

        This object, when linearised with "->linearize" instead injects
        'note' subs before and after all its children tests in the output
        linear test run, particularly useful for older Test::More instances.
