DESCRIPTION
    With Text::Split, given a split in some text, you can access the text
    preceding and remaining the split. Consecutive splitting lets you slurp
    text from between splits (optionally including the text from the splits
    at either end).

    This distribution is deprecated, and will be renamed to Text::Clip
