NAME
    Crypt::Diceware - Random passphrase generator loosely based on the
    Diceware algorithm

VERSION
    version 0.005

SYNOPSIS
      use Crypt::Diceware;
      my @phrase = words(4); # qw/starker call recur outlaw/

      # with alternate word lists
      use Crypt::Diceware words => { wordlist => 'Original' };
      use Crypt::Diceware words => { wordlist => 'Beale' };

DESCRIPTION
    This module generates a random passphrase of words based loosely on the
    Diceware <http://world.std.com/~reinhold/diceware.html> algorithm by
    Arnold G. Reinhold.

    A Diceware passphrase consists of randomly selected words chosen from a
    list of over seven thousand words. A passphrase of four or five words is
    likely to be stronger than typical human-generated passwords, which tend
    to be too-short and over-sample common letters ("e") and numbers ("1").

    Words are randomly selected using Data::Entropy in AES counter mode,
    seeded with Crypt::URandom, which is reasonably cryptographically
    strong.

USAGE
    By default, this module exports a single subroutine, "words", which uses
    the Crypt::Diceware::Wordlist::Common word list.

    An alternate wordlist may be specified:

      use Crypt::Diceware words => { wordlist => 'Original' };

    This loads the wordlist provided by Crypt::Diceware::Wordlist::Original.
    If the name of the wordlist contains *::* the name of the wordlist is
    not prefixed by *Crypt::Diceware::Wordlist*.

    It is also possible to load a wordlist from a file via:

      use Crypt::Diceware words => { file => 'diceware-german.txt' };

    The supplied file should contain one word per line.

    You can also replace the entropy source with another
    Data::Entropy::Source object:

      use Crypt::Diceware words => { entropy => $entropy_source };

    Exporting is done via Sub::Exporter so any of its features may be used:

      use Crypt::Diceware words => { -as => 'passphrase' };
      my @phrase = passphrase(4);

  words
      my @phrase = words(4);

    Takes a positive numeric argument and returns a passphrase of that many
    randomly-selected words. In a list context it will return a list of
    words, as above. In a scalar context it will return a string with the
    words separated with a single space character:

      my $phrase = words(4);

    Returns the empty list / string if the argument is missing or not a
    positive number.
