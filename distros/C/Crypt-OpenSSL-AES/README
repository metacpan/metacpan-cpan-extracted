SYNOPSIS
         use Crypt::OpenSSL::AES;

         my $cipher = Crypt::OpenSSL::AES->new($key);

         or

         # Pick better keys and iv...
         my $key = pack("H*", substr(sha512_256_hex(rand(1000)), 0, ($ks/4)));
         my $iv  = pack("H*", substr(sha512_256_hex(rand(1000)), 0, 32));
         my $cipher = Crypt::OpenSSL::AES->new(
                                                $key,
                                                {
                                                    cipher => 'AES-256-CBC',
                                                    iv      => $iv, (16-bytes for supported ciphers)
                                                    padding => 1, (0 - no padding, 1 - padding)
                                                }
                                            );

         $encrypted = $cipher->encrypt($plaintext);
         $decrypted = $cipher->decrypt($encrypted);

DESCRIPTION
    This module implements a wrapper around OpenSSL. Specifically, it wraps
    the methods related to the US Government's Advanced Encryption Standard
    (the Rijndael algorithm). The original version supports only AES ECB
    (electronic codebook mode encryption).

    This module is compatible with Crypt::CBC (and likely other modules that
    utilize a block cipher to make a stream cipher).

    This module is an alternative to the implementation provided by
    Crypt::Rijndael which implements AES itself. In contrast, this module is
    simply a wrapper around the OpenSSL library.

    As of version 0.09 additional AES ciphers are supported. Those are:

    Block Ciphers
        The blocksize is 16 bytes and must be padded if not a multiple of
        the blocksize.

        AES-128-ECB, AES-192-ECB and AES-256-ECB (no IV)
            Supports padding

        AES-128-CBC, AES-192-CBC and AES-256-CBC
            Supports padding and iv

    Stream Ciphers
        The blocksize is 1 byte. OpenSSL does not pad even if padding is set
        (the default).

        AES-128-CFB, AES-192-CFB and AES-256-CFB
            Supports iv

        AES-128-CTR, AES-192-CTR and AES-256-CTR
            Supports iv

        AES-128-OFB, AES-192-OFB and AES-256-OFB
            Supports iv

    new()
        For compatibility with old versions you can simply pass the key to
        the new constructor.

            # The default cipher is AES-ECB based on the key size
            my $cipher = Crypt::OpenSSL::AES->new($key);

            or

            # the keysize must match the cipher size
            # 16-bytes (128-bits) AES-128-xxx
            # 24-bytes (192-bits) AES-192-xxx
            # 32-bytes (256-bits) AES-256-xxx
            my $cipher = Crypt::OpenSSL::AES->new($key,
                            {
                                cipher  => 'AES-256-CBC',
                                iv      => $iv, (16-bytes for supported ciphers)
                                padding => 1, (0 - no padding, 1 - padding)
                            });

            # cipher
            #   AES-128-ECB, AES-192-ECB and AES-256-ECB (no IV)
            #   AES-128-CBC, AES-192-CBC and AES-256-CBC
            #   AES-128-CFB, AES-192-CFB and AES-256-CFB
            #   AES-128-CTR, AES-192-CTR and AES-256-CTR
            #   AES-128-OFB, AES-192-OFB and AES-256-OFB
            #
            # iv - 16-byte random data
            #
            # padding
            #   0 - no padding
            #   1 - padding

    $cipher->encrypt($data)
        Encrypt data. For Block Ciphers (ECB and CBC) the size of $data must
        be exactly "blocksize" in length (16 bytes) or padding must be
        enabled in the new constructor, otherwise this function will croak.

        For Stream ciphers (CFB, CTR or OFB) the block size is considered to
        be 1 byte and no padding is required.

        Crypt::CBC is no longer required to encrypt/decrypt data of
        arbitrary lengths.

    $cipher->decrypt($data)
        Decrypts data. For Block Ciphers (ECB and CBC) the size of $data
        must be exactly "blocksize" in length (16 bytes) or padding must be
        enabled in the new constructor, otherwise this function will croak.

        For Stream ciphers (CFB, CTR or OFB) the block size is considered to
        be 1 byte and no padding is required.

        Crypt::CBC is no longer required to encrypt/decrypt data of
        arbitrary lengths.

    keysize
        This method is used by Crypt::CBC to verify the key length. This
        module actually supports key lengths of 16, 24, and 32 bytes, but
        this method always returns 32 for Crypt::CBC's sake.

    blocksize
        This method is used by Crypt::CBC to check the block size. The
        blocksize for AES is always 16 bytes.

  USE WITH CRYPT::CBC
    As padding is now supported for the CBC cipher, Crypt::CBC is no longer
    required but supported for backward compatibility.

            use Crypt::CBC;

            my $plaintext = "This is a test!!";
            my $password = "qwerty123";
            my $cipher = Crypt::CBC->new(
                    -key    => $password,
                    -cipher => "Crypt::OpenSSL::AES",
                    -pbkdf  => 'pbkdf2',
            );

            my $encrypted = $cipher->encrypt($plaintext);
            my $decrypted = $cipher->decrypt($encrypted);
