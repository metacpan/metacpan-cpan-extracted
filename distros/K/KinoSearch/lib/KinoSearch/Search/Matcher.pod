=head1 NAME

KinoSearch::Search::Matcher - Match a set of document ids.

=head1 DEPRECATED

The KinoSearch code base has been assimilated by the Apache L<Lucy> project.
The "KinoSearch" namespace has been deprecated, but development continues
under our new name at our new home: L<http://lucy.apache.org/>

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    # abstract base class



=head1 DESCRIPTION

A Matcher iterates over a set of ascending document ids.  Some Matchers
implement score() and can assign relevance scores to the docs that they
match.  Other implementations may be match-only.

=head1 CONSTRUCTORS

=head2 new()

    my $matcher = MyMatcher->SUPER::new;

Abstract constructor.



=head1 ABSTRACT METHODS

=head2 next()

Proceed to the next doc id.

Returns: A positive doc id, or 0 once the iterator is exhausted.

=head2 get_doc_id()

Return the current doc id.  Valid only after a successful call to
next() or advance() and must not be called otherwise.

=head2 score()

Return the score of the current document.

Only Matchers which are used for scored search need implement score().



=head1 METHODS

=head2 advance(target)

Advance the iterator to the first doc id greater than or equal to
C<< target >>. The default implementation simply calls next()
over and over, but subclasses have the option of doing something more
efficient.

=over

=item *

B<target> - A positive doc id, which must be greater than the current
doc id once the iterator has been initialized.

=back

Returns: A positive doc id, or 0 once the iterator is exhausted.



=head1 INHERITANCE
