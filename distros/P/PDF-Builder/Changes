* = work in progress

  ==== New features

    lib/PDF/Builder/Content/Text.pm, examples/Column.pl
      The 'align' attribute has been added to the <hr> tag to 'left', 'center' 
      (default), or 'right' align a rule which is less than the full width of
      the column. This brings <hr> (and equivalent Markdown) in column() into
      compliance with standard HTML behavior. You may of course add CSS to left
      align <hr>s if you desire.

    lib/PDF/Builder/Content/Text.pm, examples/Column.pl
     <code> HTML tag now supported, using Courier (fixed pitch font) at 85%
      of font-size. This will reduce the number of warnings in the Column* 
      examples.

    lib/PDF/Builder/Content/Text.pm, examples/Column.pl
     Add checks for valid (supported) CSS property names. Clarify that the 
      warning message for the invalid tag <glotz> is a test and is expected and 
      normal, and likewise the warnings for CSS properties 'snork' and 'snuck' 
      are tests that are expected and normal. Ref #235.

    lib/PDF/Builder/Content/Text-Column_docs.pm
     Additional length units for CSS values in column(). In addition to pt and
      % of current font size; em (= font size), en (= 1/2 font size), ex (= 1/2
      font size), in (inches), cm, mm, and px (assume 78dpi display) are added.
      Negative values are now allowed, although negative margins are NOT yet
      fully supported. Future plans are for 'ex' to use the actual font 
      x-height, if available, and for some way to specify the screen resolution 
      (dpi) for px.

    lib/PDF/Builder/Content/Text.pm
     For Markdown (md1), if extra blank lines between list items, Text::Markdown
      produces paragraphs within list items. Suppress paragraphs within lists.

    lib/PDF/Builder/Content/Text-Column_docs.pm
     Reduce heading (h1..h6) top margins, and bottom margins by somewhat more, 
      to give a more balanced appearance and consume less vertical space.
       h1 (200% font size) top/bottom margins 75%/75%   -> 40%/30%
       h2 (150% font size) top/bottom margins 100%/100% -> 54%/40%
       h3 (115% font size) top/bottom margins 130%/130% -> 68%/51%
       h4 (100% font size) top/bottom margins 150%/150% -> 82%/61%
       h5 (85% font size)  top/bottom margins 175%/175% -> 95%/71%
       h6 (75% font size)  top/bottom margins 200%/200% -> 106%/80%
      These are the default values. You are free to change them in CSS if you
      find a different balance more pleasing to you.

    lib/PDF/Builder.pm, lib/PDF/Builder/Docs.pm, Version, Makefile.PL
     Prepare for 3.028 release. Minimum Perl version remains at 5.28.

| C A U T I O N -- Cross reference work is not 100% complete. It does not      |
|   handle multiple-pass (for forward references) yet. We hope to have that    |
|   feature out to GitHub soon, and definitely in the following release        |
|   (3.029). Meanwhile, backwards references and fully-defined target texts are|
|   properly  handled (in a single pass). You should set the maximum number of |
|   passes to 1 to prevent problems due to multiple passes in the current code.|
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
*   lib/PDF/Builder.pm, lib/PDF/Builder/Content/Text.pm, 
      lib/PDF/Builder/Docs.pm, MANIFEST, examples/Column_xrefs.pl (new), 
      examples/Column_md_xrefs.pl (new), examples/README, 
      examples/examples.output, tools/3_examples.pl, INFO/SPONSORS
     Add cross references to column() to add internal (within a document) and 
      external links to another document, both to a specific target point (by
      id) or a physical page number or a named destination.
      <a href="#pgno-x-y-zoom">link title</a> existing internal PDF link
              "ePDF#pgno-x-y-zoom"  new ext link to another PDF
              "#pgno"            new int link in doc, default fit
              "ePDF#pgno"        new ext link to another PDF
              "url"              existing link to browser URL (start with p://)
              "id" or "#id"      new (int or ext) link to doc by id
                                 may have optional leading # *unless* the id
                                   is all digits (numeric)
              "##nameddest"      new int link to a ND
              "ePDF##nameddest"  new ext link to ND in another doc
      "ePDF" is a path (usually relative) to a PDF document.
      For native Markdown, [link text](href string). As an *alternative*, the 
      new extended HTML tag may be given in either HTML or Markdown:
        <_ref tgtid="href" title="link title" fit="fit info">
      but <a href="href"> also works, and is produced by Markdown links.

      If no convenient HTML or Markdown tag is available with an id to link
      to, a reference target extended HTML tag is provided:
        <_reft id="unique id" title="optional link title fallback">.
      As described below, any child text for a tag may contain {#idname} to
      define an "id" for its parent Markdown tag.

      Work sponsored by Amtivo Group. Future plans call for extension of this
      functionality to generate Tables of Contents, Lists of Figures/Tables/
      Equations, etc., indexes, glossaries, bibliographies, footnotes/chapter
      notes/endnotes, etc.

      This is an improvement over the existing <a href= > method, because it
      can also handle external PDF files and Named Destinations, and can 
      determine the page and location of the target (rather than requiring the 
      author to manually enter this information into the "href" field) using
      multiple passes over the text source. 

      "link title" may be given in the <a> tag's child text (before </a>). If 
      missing (empty or blank), use any link title given in the target, and if 
      that is also missing, use any target child text (such as a heading's 
      text). For HTML markup, title="link title text" may be given, to override
      use of the tag's child text. In either HTML or Markdown, {^title text}
      may optionally be given in the tag's child text.

      "fit" is PDF target page fit, consisting of the type, followed by any 
      parameters. E.g., 'xyz,200,400,1.5' for a window on the page at 200,400 
      with 150% scale; or 'fit' to fit the entire page in the viewer. In HTML
      markup, fit="fitv,200" attribute may be given. In either HTML or Markdown,
      {%fitv,200} in the tag's child text (link text) may be given.

      The Markdown specification permits an id to be defined in a heading 
      (#...) entry by appending {#id-name} to the heading text. Although 
      Text::Markdown does not natively support this, Builder has been extended
      to look for such a substring, and to pull it out into an id= attribute. 
      It is further extended to look for such an id definition in any tag with
      child text, such as <p>, <i>, <blockquote>, etc. Note that most HTML tags 
      can already explicitly receive an id= attribute, so this is intended 
      primarily for Markdown usage.

      Markdown specifies a way to get an HTML title= attribute in links:
      [link text](url hover-title-text) but at this time it does not seem to
      be useful for PDF purposes, and is ignored. {#id-name} (to define an ID)
      has been extended with additional fields such as %fit and ^title (e.g., 
      {$myid}{%myfit}{^mytitle}) so that Markdown usage has all the 
      capabilities of HTML usage.

    lib/PDF/Builder.pm, lib/PDF/Builder/Docs.pm, 
      lib/PDF/Builder/Content/Text.pm, 
      lib/PDF/Builder/Content/Column_docs.pm (new), MANIFEST
     Move POD cocerning the use of column() and related routines to one place, 
      for easier reference and updating it.

    lib/PDF/Builder/Resource/CIDFont.pm, 
      lib/PDF/Builder/Resource/CIDFont/TrueType-CJKFont.pm
     Make a start at updating POD to try to document many font-related
      utility routines, especially for TTFs (TrueType).

    lib/PDF/Builder/Content.pm, lib/PDF/Builder/Content/Text.pm,
      examples/ContentText.pl
      The section()/paragraphs() method is updated to permit a negative 
      'pvgap' value. The |pvgap| value is still used to add additional vertical 
      space between paragraphs, but if negative, no space is added after the 
      last paragraph in the section(). The ContentText example is updated.

    examples/Content.pl, examples/ContentText.pl
     Update to change old-style -name options to 'name'.

    META.json, META.yml, devtools/PDFBuild.pl
     Add "provides" section to build description.

    SECURITY.md (new), MANIFEST
     Although, given its nature, it is unlikely that there are any potential 
      security vulnerabilities in PDF::Builder, all package providers and 
      maintainers have been asked to provide a standardized guide for 
      reporting suspected security-related problems.

    lib/PDF/Builder.pm, lib/PDF/Builder/Resource/CIDFont/TrueType/FontFile.pm,
      lib/PDF/Builder/FontManager.pm
     Per PDF::API2 PR#92, contributed by Johan Vromans, add the ability to 
      pass in an already-existing TTF/OTF font object (Font::TTF::Font) to 
      ttfont() and font(). This is useful if you already have such an object, 
      such as already read-in as an embedded font or built on-the-fly, rather 
      than having to write out a TTF font file and read it back in via ttfont().
      It is also expected to prove useful for future TTC (TrueType Collection) 
      support. The ability to register such a font object in FontManager
      (object as a "file name") has been added.

    lib/PDF/Builder.pm, lib/PDF/Builder/FontManager.pm, 
      lib/PDF/Builder/Content/Text.pm, examples/Column-Column_lists.pl
     Fix inconsistency in no longer supporting the use of a preloaded font
      before the column() call being used as the current body font. You may
       * option 'font_info'=>'-ext-' says that user code has ALREADY loaded a 
         font (either by Builder primitives or through FontManager), and to use
         that (font-family named '-external-) as the body font. If there is no 
         preloaded font, use the FontManager default (core Times-Roman).
       * default (or option 'font_info'=>'-fm-') load the FontManager
         default font (core Times-Roman) as the body font.
       * option 'font_info'=>'face:style:weight:color' says to load as the 
         current font a 'face' KNOWN TO FontManager, with optional specification
         of the style and weight (default both normal) and color (unchanged).
         - style: 0/normal (default) = unitalicized, 1/italic = italicized
         - weight: 0/normal (default) = normal weight, 1/bold = bold weight
         - color: named color or gray value 0 to 1. defaults to current color
      There are several ways of overriding the column() call's specified font 
      (whether set by default or via 'font_info').
       * in the column() call, use option 
         'style'=>'body { font-family: face; font-style =... }' CSS to
         override anything else. 
       * in Markdown or HTML source, add a <style> tag at the beginning, to
         specify CSS to set the body's font-family.

      In all cases, the font-family etc. must be KNOWN to FontManager (i.e., 
      add_font() the new face if not a core default), except for an external
      font (font_info -ext-), which can be from any source. However, keep in 
      mind that column() can NOT switch to and from italic or bold if an 
      -external- font is being used, as it does NOT know the font-family and 
      FontManager face, and thus how to get to the italic or bold face.

    lib/PDF/Builder.pm, lib/PDF/Builder/Content/Text.pm
     'arabic' is permitted as a synonym for 'decimal' numbering (1,2,3...)
      for both page labels ($pdf->page_labels) and ordered lists in column()
      (CSS list-style-type). Ref PDF::API2#40.

    lib/PDF/Builder.pm, lib/PDF/Builder/NamedDestination-Annotation-Docs.pm, 
      examples/040_annotation-042_links, examples/resources/040_annotation.pdf,
      examples/NamedDest.pl (new), examples/examples.output, examples/README,
      t/named-destinations.t, MANIFEST, tools/3_examples.pl
     Update documentation and examples to demonstrate use of Named Destinations,
      per #202. 040_annotation had two Named Destinations added on page 2 
      ('foo' whole page and 'bar' zoomed in) and the resources copy of the PDF 
      was updated (referred to by 042_links). 042_links had two Named 
      Destinations added on page 4 ('foo' whole page and 'bar' zoomed in), as 
      well as links demonstrating the four Named Destination examples. Many
      thanks to @sciurius for his help on figuring out ND's!

      lib/PDF/Builder/FontManager.pm, lib/PDF/Builder/Docs.pm, 
      t/font-corefont.t, examples/020_corefonts
     Per API2 contribution by Johan Vromans (PR #76), add two functions listing 
      and checking core fonts. For PDF::Builder, added ability to select normal 
      core set (default), or add the 15 Windows core font extension. In
      FontManager, always load the Windows core fonts -- can still produce a
      document even if it can't be displayed on a non-Windows platform. In
      contrast, in examples/020_corefonts, output Windows core fonts only if
      running on Windows, as the intent is to be able to display them.

    lib/PDF/Builder/Content.pm
     Per change in PDF::API2, add to description of endpath/end method.

  ==== Bug fixes

    Makefile.PL, INFO/DEPRECATED
     Add installation-time reminder to check DEPRECATED for anything scheduled
      to be removed, including dashed option names (to be unsupported starting
      with release 3.030 or later).

    lib/PDF/Builder/Content/Text-Column_docs.pm
     Since the introduction, the CSS property 'text-height' has been used for
     the unitless multiplier of font size to get the line-to-line spacing. This
     has been corrected to the name 'line-height'. 'text-height' will be allowed
     for an alias or synonym for 'line-height' for releases 3.028 and 3.029, but
     will be removed as early as release 3.030, so plan accordingly.

    lib/PDF/Builder/Content/Text.pm
     Fix loss of heading margin top after horizontal rule at top of page.

    t/svg.t
     Remove section of comparison that included 'gray' color as RGB. The old
      SVGPDF library used 3 x 0x7F, while the new one uses a different color
      library which defines gray as 3 x 0x80. This change allows testing with
      either the old or the new version of SVGPDF. Re #237.

    lib/PDF/Builder/Content/Text.pm
     Fixed a code path where a paragraph top margin could be applied twice,
      resulting in excessive space between paragraphs or with headings.

    lib/PDF/Builder/Docs.pm
     Ref #231, explain that an externally produced PDF (from "Canva") was 
      leaving the fill state as "transparent", and so any graphics fill or
      text was disappearing. The solution is to use egstate() to reset fill
      state to "opaque" (transparency to 0, see examples/060_transparency
      and ticket #231).

    lib/PDF/Builder/Content/Text.pm
     When revising the baseline due to taller text, there was a miscalculation
      of the length of the line, resulting in false reports of the line being
      too long, and the baseline revision therefore not being performed.

    lib/PDF/Builder.pm, lib/PDF/Page.pm
     Ref #230, clarify POD (documentation) on what is returned when *setting*
      values via default_page_size(), default_page_boundaries(), and
      boundaries().

    lib/PDF/Builder/Content/Text.pm
     Fix problem with not consistently supporting the 'style' option in
      column().

    lib/PDF/Builder.pm, lib/PDF/Builder/Resource/CIDFont/TrueType.pm,
      lib/PDF/Builder/Resource/CIDFont/TrueType/FontFile.pm
     Some cleanup related to API2's change from -noembed flag for TTF to
      -embed (-'s are optional, preferably omitted). 'embed' option now works.
      Per PDF::API2 #90 and possibly PDF::Builder #222. 
       Aside: the data structure in a TTF file is 'noembed', so presumably the 
       ttfont() option was originally named 'noembed' too (default 0/false), 
       but recently changed to 'embed' (default 1/true) as being more 
       straightforward for coders. 
      'noembed' is still valid, although it is ignored if 'embed' is also given.
      Note that #222 is not fully resolved. Although the size of 'noembed' <
       size of 'subset' (default) < size of 'nosubset' (full font embed), it
       appears that there is still some extra font-related material (such as
       a full CMap?) in the noembed and subset usages. This still needs to be
       looked at.

    lib/PDF/Builder/Resource/Font/CoreFont/symbol.pm
     While thinking about an implementation of #56 (fallback glyphs), I took
      a deep look at the Symbol core font (for the eventual purpose of adding
      the Greek alphabet to the TrueType fonts that lack it), using a glyph 
      fallback mechanism. I added some notes in the code on what is the 
      "regular" form of a given Greek letter, and what is the "variant" form 
      (suffixed with "1", except that "sigma1" is the terminal form of sigma). 
      It appears that Symbol swapped the two forms of "phi". What it calls 
      "regular" phi (0x66) should be called the "variant" form, and what it 
      calls "variant" phi ('phi1', 0x6A) is really the regular form. As the 
      order of the alphabet is so scrambled, hopefully no one is simply using 
      it "in order", but instead carefully picking each letter!

    lib/PDF/Builder/Basic/PDF/File.pm
     Per #198, add 0 to object numbers when read in, to ensure that they are
      seen as decimal numbers, and not misinterpreted as octal values.

3.027     2025-04-18

  ==== New features

    examples/FontManager.pl
     Add more examples of non-standard fonts, and give more control over
      which get displayed (if available). Note that not all these fonts come
      with a given OS, and those that do almost certainly need their paths 
      updated. "Script" is omitted for this release, as it still needs work on 
      selecting a suitable default script font.

    META.json, META.yml, Makefile.PL, README.md, examples/Column.pl,
      lib/PDF/Builder.pm, version
     Update minimum supported Perl level from 5.26 to 5.28. Also copyright
      dates to 2025.

    README.md, INFO/Prereq_fixes.md (new), MANIFEST, examples/Column.pl
     Move patches needed for some prerequisites (required or optional) to a
      new file INFO/Prereq_fixes.md, to reduce clutter in README.md.

    lib/PDF/Builder.pm, lib/PDF/Builder/Resource/XObject/Image/SVG.pm (new),
      lib/PDF/Builder/Content.pm, Makefile.PL, README.md, INFO/ACKNOWLEDGE.md, 
      tools/optional_update.pl, t/svg.t (new), t/00-all-usable.t, META.yml, 
      tools/2_t-tests.pl, devtools/PDFbuild.pl, MANIFEST, version, 
      examples/SVG.pl (new), examples/resources/SVG/ATS_flow-GIFfilein-
      GPscatter5-MJdisplayNoTag-QRcode.svg (new), examples/README, 
      examples/examples.output, tools/3_examples.pl
     Add code to support via SVGPDF (package by Johan Vromans) SVG images with 
      image_svg() method. In the near future, plans are to add MathJax markup,
      GNUplot interfaces, and enhanced barcode support; all of which make use
      of SVG.

    lib/PDF/Builder/Content/Text.pm, lib/PDF/Builder/Docs.pm, 
      lib/PDF/Builder/Content.pm, MANIFEST, README.md, tools/3_examples.pl, 
      examples/Column.pl, examples/Column_lists.pl (new), devtools/PDFbuild.pl
     Rearchitect list (ul and ol) generation to improve appearance and permit
      upgrades to capabilities. Add <_marker> tag to permit overrides of 
      properties of individual <ol> and <ul> markers (e.g., bullet color) at 
      any or all <li>. This non-standard HTML tag can be used explicitly to 
      modify marker properties, and is automatically inserted into the code if 
      not manually given. The new (non-standard) CSS properties and defaults 
      and examples are
        _marker-text (define text to use as marker, rather than default)
          '' (no change) for ol, ul; "=>" instead of a bullet
        _marker-color (change color from default) 
          '' (no change) for ol, ul; "blue' instead of normal text black
        _marker-font (change marker font-family)
          '' (no change) for ol, ZapfDingbats for ul; "sans-serif" for 
          different ol marker font
        _marker-style (change marker font-style, e.g., italic)
          '' (no change) for ol, ul; "italic" to italicize a marker
        _marker-size (change marker font-size)
          '' (no change) for ol, 50% for ul;  "80%" for slightly reduced size
        _marker-weight (change marker font-weight)
          'bold' for ol, ul;  "normal" if don't want bold markers
        _marker-align (left/center/right justify marker text within
          marker_width). 'right' is default
      The defaults are the normal font-family, color, etc. inherited from
      the <ol> or <ul> tag, updated by the usual suspects (style, CSS, etc.),
      and finally overridden by _marker-* properties (inherited and set in the
      usual manner). If you nest lists, you may need to cancel _marker-* 
      properties by setting them to ''. Note that if you set something like the
      "color" property in the <ol> or <ul> tag, it will *also* apply to each
      <li> list item! Instead, set "_marker-color" to affect only markers.
      Split out list examples from Column.pl examples, into Column_lists.pl.

    lib/PDF/Builder/Content/Text.pm, examples/Column_lists.pl
     Add "simple" list <_sl>, much like <ul> with 'none' for the 
      list-style-type, that is, a list with no marker.

    lib/PDF/Builder/Content/Text.pm, examples/Column_lists.pl
     Support standard HTML attributes <ol type="f"> (1AaIi), <li value="n">,
      <li type="f">. The <li> are useful for changing the count in the middle
      of an ordered list, or overriding the list-style-type for one element.

    lib/PDF/Builder/Content/Text.pm, examples/Column_lists.pl
     Add CSS list-style-position property, with support for 'inside' and
      'outside' (default). In addition, extend CSS by allowing N% value, where
      the value is the percentage of marker_width to indent the left edge of
      second, etc. lines of <li> text. This permits a "hanging marker" effect
      without the full "outside" setting (0% = "inside", 100% = "outside").
      Also, an Npt value may be given, which is the indent amount in points
      (0 = "inside", marker_width pts = "outside"). In both cases, results may
      be undesirable if N% is outside the range 0 to 100, or Npt is outside the
      range 0 to marker_width. We recommend that you stay within these limits.

    lib/PDF/Builder/Content/Text.pm, examples/Column.pl
     CSS text-align property for left, center, and right added.

    lib/PDF/Builder/Content/Text.pm, examples/Column.pl
     Implement HTML extension <_move> tag: "x" attribute = absolute 
      positioning within column and/or "dx" attribute = relative positioning. 
      If $x is undefined, assume is at 0. This can be used to place text at
      desired point(s) on a given line, such as a page title at the left and
      page number at the right of a header or footer.

       t/00-all-usable.t, t/tiff.t, t/version.t, tools/2_t-tests.pl
     Fix "require" of external libraries so oddly formatted VERSION numbers 
       don't derail PDF::Builder loading. Builder was blowing up when 
       Image::PNG::Libpng went to version 0.57_01 (development version)
       for a while. Use version->parse("string")->numify() to create a uniform 
       numeric version value for comparison (against a mininum). Also add 
       SVGPDF version. Because of the conflict between the package 'version' 
       and the function 'version()', change the function name to pdf_version().
       Note that minimum levels must be proper integer or real numbers, and
       cannot have any underscores, dashes, or multiple decimal points! To do
       so would require quotes around the value so it is treated as a string.

    examples/020_corefonts 
     Clean up code to permit any of three command lines: (nothing) -- default
      list of all core fonts, (-s) -- 3 sample core fonts, (list of names) --
      specified names (e.g., you need a quick list of what's in Zapf Dingbats
      and Wingdings).

    lib/PDF/Builder/Content/Text.pm
      Minor change to font size upon entry: first it is defaulted to 12pt. The
      next step of overriding that setting with the text object's fontsize has
      been removed, as this often produced unexpected results. Finally, the 
      third step is to use the 'font_size' optional value, if given.

    lib/PDF/Builder/Content/Text.pm, examples/Column.pl
     Fold all HTML tags to lower case (to support <P> etc.), detect 
      unsupported or invalid tags and give error message (just once for each, 
      per column() call). Treat unknown tags as <span> tag. In Column.pl,
      A few tags are now upper case (are accepted), and some bogus tags (expect 
      an error message) and bogus CSS entries (ignored) in one sample.

    lib/PDF/Builder/docs/buildDoc.pl
     Add run suggestions and examples for other structures of packages.

      lib/PDF/Builder/Resource/CIDFont/CJKFont-TrueType.pm,
      lib/PDF/Builder/Resoure/Font/BdFont-CoreFont-Postscript-SynFont.pm,
     Rearrange some of the documentation and update some "Options" lists to
      make looking up font options more straightforward and complete.

    lib/PDF/Builder/Content.pm
      Move end/endpath description (POD) to a more appropriate section.

    lib/PDF/Builder/Basic/PDF/File.pm
      If open() for update, check that existing PDF is read/write. Also report
       any error opening a PDF, and die, instead of just returning.

    lib/PDF/Builder/Docs-Outlines-Outline.pm
      Clarify and extend the documentation for creating and maintaining
       outlines (bookmarks), including how to create multilevel (nested)
       bookmarks. Remove '$prev' entry from Outline's constructor, as it
       appears to have never functioned as intended. Instead, use the methods
       insert_before() and insert_after() to place a bookmark within an
       existing list. If you *are* successfully using '$prev', please describe
       how you are using it so I can document it and restore it to the code!
       Note that original Outline problem (#207) remains to be fixed!

      lib/PDF/Builder/Resource/XObject/Image/TIFF_GT.pm,
      lib/PDF/Builder/Resource/XObject/Image/TIFF/File_GT.pm
     Update Image::PNG::Libpng handling so that SVGPDF library will be able
      to handle inlined PNG images by passing an IO::String "filehandle" from
      File::LoadLines, etc. Also, TIFF (with Graphics::TIFF usage) will now
      accept filehandles (at least, "GLOB" type) as input, and write out a
      temporary file to use. Certain operating systems seem to have trouble
      erasing the temporary file, so temps may build up over time! This area of
      filehandle inputs is still being actively investigated. It appears that
      all image formats except GD (GIF, JPEG, TIFF, TIFF with Graphics::TIFF, 
      PNM, PNG, and PNG with Image::PNG::Libpng) can now be given either a 
      filepath and name, or a Perl filehandle.

    lib/PDF/Builder/Content.pm
     Correct placement of content of "object" and in POD elaborate on necessary
      corrections that may be needed.

    (most .pm files) update POD for more consistent appearance, including links
      for major entries and methods.
    docs/buildDoc.pl put NAVIGATION links at the top of the Table of Contents,
      since usually now many more entries are in the TOC. The links themselves
      are still at the bottom of the page.
    devtools/PDFbuild.pl updates found to be needed in 3.026 build.

  ==== Bug fixes

    lib/PDF/Builder/Basic/PDF/Dict.pm
     Per #221, don't let unblessed objects get through (causes error).

    lib/PDF/Builder/Basic/PDF/Array.pm, examples/ShowFont.pl
     Fix a typo in ShowFont example (#222), and a bug in Array.pm that led to 
      Array's outobjdeep() blowing up if there was no graphics object 
      (page->gfx) defined, but apparently only when dealing with TTF fonts! It 
      has been patched with a workaround, which will do for now, but a 
      permanent fix is a TBD item.

    lib/PDF/Builder/Content/Text.pm
     Correct the wrong width being used when Content::Hyphenate_basic::splitWord
      is called from column(). Reported by @CtrlO.

    lib/PDF/Builder/Basic/PDF/File.pm
     Per PDF::API2 commit 308e70f, die (crash) with message instead of
      freezing up if a malformed PDF trailer's Prev keys result in a loop
      or if multiple trailers use the same object ID and generation number.

    README.md, INFO/prereq_fixes.md
     Note on installing on older Macs: see #223 and INFO/prereq_fixes.md for 
      dealing with strange errors with the "convert" utility (ImageMagick). 
      Apparently it was missing the Arial font on some older releases.

    lib/PDF/Builder/Content.pm, t/text.t
     The advancewidth() function was not properly counting the space added by
      character space and word space settings, in some cases. This could become
      very apparent in lines with multiple writes, where it wasn't counting
      extra space added after the last character in a write. A note was also
      added to the word space documentation explaining that all spaces between
      words receive the extra word space (not just once per run of spaces), and
      inter-word spaces also receive extra character space (Tc). Thanks to
      @gtnuux for reporting this (#224) and suggesting the fix.

      As a practical matter, advancewidth() now properly returns any extra
      space added to the last character (charspace or wordspace), whereas
      before, it wasn't. This may slightly change the behavior of your program,
      especially if a line was constructed with multiple writes (text calls).
      With single writes, the extra space was hidden by the right margin.

    lib/PDF/Builder.pm, /lib/PDF/Builder/Page.pm
     Per #219, fixes to default_page_boundaries().

    lib/PDF/Builder.pm
     Some PDF Readers (including some releases of Adobe Acrobat Reader) ignore 
      a request for decimal page numbers (and output a page label of "Page m 
      of n") if an explicit Start value isn't given. Default Start value to 1
      (and always explicitly specify to PDF Reader if page labels used).

    lib/PDF/Builder/Basic/PDF/File.pm
     Add newline after 'm n obj' to bring more in conformance with PDF/A
      requirements (ISO 19005-1:2005, Clause: 6.1.8) per #52 and PDF::API2 #82.
      Already had newline before 'endobj'.
      
    lib/PDF/Builder.pm, lib/PDF/Builder/Docs.pm
     Update recommendations that not only should T1 (PS) font and CJK font
      users strongly consider changing over to TTF/OTF fonts, but add that
      "core" fonts (while they will always be supported), are rather limited in 
      their capabilities (especially single-byte encoding only, no UTF-8, 
      limited selection of glyphs, no font embedding) and users should consider 
      changing over to TTF/OTF fonts to get more capabilities.

    lib/PDF/Builder.pm, lib/PDF/Builder/Content.pm, 
      lib/PDF/Builder/Content/Text.pm, lib/PDF/Builder/CIDFont.pm
     Fix failed paragraph justification due to word-spacing not being passed
      to text output routine when TTF/OTF fonts are used, per #193.

    lib/PDF/Builder/Basic/PDF/File.pm, devtools/html2php-PDFbuild-PDFversion.pl
     Minor cleanup to get clean perlcritic run.

    lib/PDF/Builder/Content.pm, lib/PDF/Builder/Resource/BaseFont.pm,
      lib/PDF/Builder/Content/Text.pm
     Per ticket #215 (Johan Vromans), corrected underlining (and also strike-
      through and [future] overline) thickness and positioning to use the 
      correct Units Per Em (usually 1000, but many recent TTF and OTF fonts 
      use 2048 or even higher values).

    lib/PDF/Builder/Content/Text.pm
     Avoid top margins if at very beginning of column, and not just for
      <p> paragraphs.

    lib/PDF/Builder.pm, lib/PDF/Builder/Page.pm
     Fix #210 (reported in API2 #75) default_page_size() was failing.

    lib/PDF/Builder/Resource/Font/CoreFont.pm
     Expand on descriptions of standard and Windows core fonts.

    INFO/prereq_fixes.md, lib/PDF/Builder/Content/Text.pm, README.md, 
      examples/Column.pl
     There is a bug in HTML::TreeBuilder prerequisite HTML::Tagset
      (https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=151970), prior to
      version 3.22, where <ins> and <del> tags cause unwanted paragraph breaks
      due to being missing from the list of inline tags. The instructions for
      fixing this in HTML::Tagset are given in INFO/prereq_fixes.md.
      
    README.md, contrib/*, examples/*, tools/*, devtools/PDFbuild.pl, 
      devtools/PDFversion.pl, docs/buildDoc.pl
     Bite the bullet and change "my $LAST_UPDATE" to "our $LAST_UPDATE", and
      remove the build-time edit of all these files. .pm file instances were
      already changed earlier during POD structure updates.

    examples/RMtutorial.pl
     Correct font 'Times' to 'Times-Roman' to avoid warning messages.

(see INFO/Changes_2023 for earlier changes)

Note that INFO/Changes-ver_2 (for changes released for PDF::API2, and 
incorporated into PDF::Builder) is NOT being updated any longer. You may
assume that any change logged for API2 has also been incorporated into
Builder, with any exceptions or differences noted here.
