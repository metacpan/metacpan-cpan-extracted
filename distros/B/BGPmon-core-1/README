BGPmon-core version 0.01
========================

BGPmon-core is a collection of Perl functions that
are useful for obtaining and parsing BGPmon XML messages.

- Log.pm contains common logging functions that allow one to
  easily write log messages to syslog,  STDERR,  or a file.

- Configure.pm contains common functions that allow
  one to easily include command line options and configuration
  files.

- Fetch.pm allows one to easily access XML messages
  from a live stream,  a file,  or a web-based archive.

- Fetch modules are used by Fetch.pm to handle specific
  types of data.   For example, File.pm fetches data from a
  file.   These modules may be used directly, but the
  preferred method is to simply use Fetch.pm and it determines
  the appropriate module to use.

- Translator modules translate XML messages into other formats.
  For exmaple,  one can translate the XML into MRT or into
  ASCII pipe ("|") delimited files.

- Filter.pm allows one to easily discover if a BGP message contains
  IPv4 or IPv6 prefixes, or autonymous system number of interest.

The combination of logging, configuration, data access, data 
translation, and filtering should allow the rapid creation of clients
that make use of the BGPmon data.
