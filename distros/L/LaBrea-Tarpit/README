INSTALL
    * Package
                Untar the package

                perl Makefile.PL
                make
                make test
                make install

                To use examples/daemon.pl, configure
                the array at the beginning of the script
                and set the locations for the cache files.
                ...typically /var/tmp/labrea.cache
                and /var/tmp/DShield.cache

    * Report/examples/html_report.plx
    * Report/examples/paged_report.plx
        html_report and paged_report will run as a cgi scripts by simply
        renaming them xxx_report.cgi. It is highly recommend that you enable
        the file caching to minimize load on your system.

        Read the comments in the file itself for configuration. The defaults
        should work fine, but you must create the temporary directory used
        for file caching AND it must be writable by the web server.

        html_report and paged_report are configured to provide other_site
        reporting. You must set up the cron job maintain the site_stats file
        for reporting. See webscan.pl below:

    * Get/examples/web_scan.pl
        Run web_scan.pl from a cron job hourly or daily to update the
        statistics from all know sites running LaBrea::Tarpit. A report can
        then be generated showing the activity worldwide.

          # MIN HOUR DAY MONTH DAYOFWEEK   COMMAND
          30 * * * * ./web_scan.pl ./other_sites.txt ./tmp/site_stats

          Also see: LaBrea::Tarpit::Report::other_sites

    * examples/tell_me.pl AGE
        Run tell_me.pl from a cron job daily to send yourself an email
        detailing teergrubed hosts that have been held longer than AGE days.
        You might actually want to tell the bad guys that they have a rogue
        machine.

          # MIN HOUR DAY MONTH DAYOFWEEK   COMMAND
          30 * * * * ./tell_me.pl 60  # default

    * DShield/examples/mail_dshield.pm
        Configure with your DShield UserID, email address, mail agent and
        the location of the daemon - DShield cache file, then run
        periodically from cron to send reports to DShield.

DESCRIPTION - LaBrea::Tarpit
    A comprehensive Hack Attack reporting module when used in conjunction
    with Tom Liston's LaBrea scanner/worm disruptor. When configured with
    reporting and stat collection it provides a detailed HTML page
    containing:

    * Bandwidth consumed by attack/disruption daemon
    * Summary of previous 5 days of attack/disruption
    * All IP addresses currently attacking
    * IP address, port attacked/held, attack start time
    * As above, but history of terminated attacks
    * By day detail graphs on port attack intensity
    * Active summary of known LaBrea::Tarpit sites
    For more information on LaBrea see: http://www.hackbusters.net/ or
    contact the author of LaBrea, Tom Liston the tliston@hackbusters.net
    entry elsewhere in this document.

    The parsed output of either syslog data or STDOUT from LaBrea using -o
    or -O options is readily turned into text reports or an html output
    page.

    Basically there are two methods of operation. You can use the daemon
    mode to create an almost realtime cache that may be parsed using the
    report routines, or you can use the update and report routines to parse
    the syslog files on an as needed basis. If you plan to create web page
    reports, the daemon model will use less system resources in the long run
    and avoids running syslog with the high volume output of LaBrea.

    Improvements VERSION 1.00

    As of version 1.00, daemon.pl uses network sockets to provide data for
    the report modules. This means that the daemon can run on a remote
    machine and the report scripts and web server can be somewhere else.

    For those of you upgrading from older versions, you MUST upgrade all of
    your report scripts as well. Older versions use a pipe or FIFO and this
    is no longer supported as there were problems maintaining separate
    sessions.

    * recurse_hash2txt(\$txt_buffer,\%hash,$keys_so_far,flag)
       Appends to txt_buffer.

       Generates a text tree of a hash.
       %hash{lvl1}->{lvl2}->{lvl3} = 5;       this real hash
       flag = 0, ksf = ''                     with this input
       lvl1:lvl2:lvl3:5               produces this text
       flag = 1, ksf = ptr                    this input
       ptr->{lvl1}->{lvl2}->{lvl3} = 5;       this txt

    * ($LBfh,$version,$kid) = lbd_open($LaBrea,$DEBUG);
      Core daemon start routine. Not exported, but can be replaced
      externally with:

        *LaBrea::Tarpit::lbd_open = sub { stuff };

      Returns the pid of the underlying process (if any) and the version
      number of that process. It also sets the command line shown by 'ps'
      like this:

        $0 = 'stuff';

        input:        path to daemon,
                      STDERR switch
        returns:      LaBrea file handle,
                      version,
                      pid of kid

    * lbd_close($LBfh,$kid);
      Core daemon close routine, not exported but can be replaced externally
      with:

        *LaBrea::Tarpit::lbd_close = sub { sutff };

      Close the daemon and kill off $kid with sig 15

        input:        filehandle,
                      pid of kid
        returns:      nothing

    * daemon(&hash | \%hash)
       input parameters: from hash or pointer to hash

       };

      The daemon can be run on a remote host with restricted client access
      and the data retrieved by another host that has web server
      capabilities

        scanners is enabled by setting to a positive number. Since all IP's
        that are seen but not captured can potentially be saved, this list
        could grow very large. You can limit the amount of memory used by
        setting the number of items that can be saved. There is no default,
        a value <= 0 turns of this feature. Scanners are saved on a fifo
        basis, when full, the oldest will be deleted first.

       Signals:

        HUP           cull then write new cache file
        TERM          cull, write cache, exit

        Killing the daemon with SIG_KILL (-9) will NOT write
        a new cache file and will leave LaBrea running.
        YOU SHOULD NOT DO THIS

      daemon operation: The daemon parses the output of LaBrea in real time
      and collects the information in its memory cache, periodically pruning
      away threads that are no longer active to minimize the memory
      footprint. Upon receiving a HUP, it immediately prunes memory of old
      threads and writes its cache to file.

      data retrieval

        Usage:
              connect to TCP port 8686
              send "standard" (endline)
                or
              send "active" (endline)
                or
              send "short" (endline)
                or
              send "config" (endline)

      to receive the complete memory cache described above or only active
      threads or a truncated version suitable for making a short report.
      config sends the daemon configuration file information to the client.

    * $bandwidth = bandwidth(\%tarpit);
      Returns bandwidth reported by LaBrea or zero if the -b option is not
      used or bw is unknown.

    * $time = midnight($epoch_time,$tz);
       Returns epoch time at 00:00:00 of current day
       from any epoch time submitted. Time zone is
       calculated (inefficently) each time if omitted.  

    * $seconds = $tz2_sec($tz);
        Convert time zone into seconds

        input:        timezone i.e. -0800
        returns:      seconds i.e. -28800

    * $time_string = their_date($gmtime,$tz);
        Returns date string like perl's 
        localtime(time)
        for the specified time zone

    * $timezone = timezone($now);
       Returns the local timezone as a text string
              i.e. -0800
       uses current time if $now is omitted, 
       this is the normal method of usage.

    * $rv = restore_tarpit(\%tarpit,path2cache_file);
       Restore the memory cache from the file cache.

       returns        true if successful
                      false if cache_file won't open

       File Cache is of the form:
         _VERSION:Package::Name version daemon | static
         _CACHEDUMP:date of last cache dump
              # for each src host
         at:ip_addr:sport:dest
         at:ip_addr:sport:dport
         at:ip_addr:sport:ct
         at:ip_addr:sport:last
         at:ip_addr:sport:persist
         at:ip_addr:sport:DShield:dest:dp:time

         bw:number
              # for each scanning (gone) host
         dt:ip_addr:sport:dport
         dt:ip_addr:sport:last
         dt:ip_addr:persist

         ph:time:dport:count

         now:1234567890

         tz:-0800

    * array2_tarpit(\%tarpit,\@array);
      Restore the memory cache from an array of lines as described for
      restore_tarpit. The lines must already be stripped of return
      characters

      Always returns true;

    * $rv = log2_mem(\%tarpit,log_line,is_daemon,port_intvls,DShield);
      Update memory cache from log output line. Set is_daemon if the log
      output is from daemon STDOUT

      In order of minimum CPU overhead: Daemon mode or logs created from
      STDOUT require the least cpu overhead. LaBrea -O is more efficient
      than Labrea -o. Logs from STDOUT are more efficient than syslogs.
      Standalone syslogs are more efficient than mixed.

       All log lines used are of the form:

       epoch time (seconds)
              or
       date text      
              followed by
       [...LaBrea:]           # syslog only
              one of these
       info text bw:  bandwidth (bytes/sec)
              or
       info text:  src_ip src_port txt dest_ip dest_port

       Or more succinctly:
       time text: bandwidth
              or
       time text: src_ip src_port txt dest_ip dest_port

       Returns:       true / false on success / fail

    * $rv = process_log(\%tarpit,path2log_file,is_daemon,port_intvls);
      Update the memory cache from a file with lines of the form described
      for log2_mem

      Set is_daemon if the output log was created from STDOUT of LaBrea or
      if you can guarantee that there is nothing in the file except LaBrea
      lines.

      Returns true on success, false if file fails to open

    * $rv=cull_threads(\%tarpit,timeout,scanners,port_intvls,DShield);
      Cull aged threads from memory cache. Default time is 600 seconds (10
      min). On startup, no culls are done for the cull time interval to
      retain old capture time information for any lingering black hats that
      may fall back into the tarpit.

      See daemon description for scanners, port_intvls

      cull_threads updates the time zone of the tarpit cache

      appends DShield info to file specified in DShield if present

        returns:      true if threads removed, else false

    * $rv = write_cache_file(\%tarpit,path2cache_file,umask,flag);
       Write memory cache to file.
       returns cache text on success, false if file fails to open.

              umask defaults to 033 if not supplied

       File Cache is of the form:
         _VERSION:Package::Name version daemon | static
         _CACHEDUMP:date of last cache dump

      see description above in restore_tarpit

       flag   = true,  append 'daemon' to version
       flag   = false, append 'static' to version

    * prep_report(\%tarpit,\%hash);
       Prepare arrays of report values from the tarpit memory cache.
       Only the values requested will be filled.

       %hash values:          times in seconds since epoch
