This module provides an object-oriented interface for converting
'numbers' with scientific postfix scale factors (really strings) to
real numbers and back, i.e.

2.5u <--> 2.5e-6
25K  <--> 2.5e4

The column on the left is typical of simulator and tester output, while
the column on the right are numbers that you can actually do math on
in perl.

(As a sidenote, I've tried to keep current with new modules that have
come out like Number::Format and Interpolation.  Neither of those
modules provide the functionality that this module does in a generic
sense, that of being a "conversion tool".  They both format numbers
pretty easily, but neither 'unformat'.)

Each object that is created allow the user to define the format of
numbers as postfix scale factors are added (number to string
conversion), and provides functions for converting from string to
numbers. (See the module documentation for details).

Three different styles of postfixes are supported, SPICE, SI, and CS.  The
main difference between the first two is the capatilization of the postfixes
for all fixes greater than one, ie kilo, mega, and so on.  A list of
the abbreviations can be found in the module documentation.  The third
format, CS, refers to "computer science" and is used to format numbers
based on powers of two, rather than ten.

The format of numbers as they are converted from strings can
be set by the user to be any valid format to sprintf.  This is
checked by Convert::SciEng as matching the following regexp:

/^\%\d+\.\d+([scduxoefg]|l[duxo])$/

This code should be considered beta.  I have been using it for
scripting here at work, but of course I may have missed something.

This module has wandered a lot since its original creation.  Only God
knows what its's going next.  Here are some of the things that have
occurred to me:

1)Strings that are converted to numbers aren't given any particular
  format.  I could see where this might be important, but then again,
  it might not.

2)The most important format isn't available, that is, engineering
  fix in scientific notation.  Take for example the numbers used
  above:

  2.5u <--> 2.5e-6  #This is fine
  25k  <--> 2.5e4   #This is okay
  25k  <--> 25e3    #This is great!

  I got a hold of the source for lib stdio and found a great big
  incredible mess.  I would love to find a competent C programmer
  who was interested in taking on this project.
