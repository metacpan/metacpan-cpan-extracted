StatsView Version 1.4
=====================

DESCRIPTION
-----------

StatsView is a GUI-based tool for viewing the output of the various utilities
that produce system performance statistics.  At the moment sar, iostat, vmstat
mpstat and vxstat are supported.  There is also a GUI to allow the collection
of these statistics.  It is also possible to collect and display Oracle
statistics.  Suggestions for other statistic types are welcome!

StatsView offers the following features:

o Allows multiple data sources and graphs to be displayed simultaneously
o Supports both printing and saving of the graphs in a wide range of
  formats: Postscript, CGM, (Microsoft Office), MIF (FrameMaker), GIF and as a
  CSV - useful for extracting data from sar files!
o Supports both binary (sar -o) and text (sar > file) sar data files.
o Allows the selection of which category of sar data is to be viewed, e.g.
  CPU, Paging, Disk I/O etc.
o Within a category, it allows the selection of individual data items, e.g.
  for CPU data %usr, %sys, %wio and %idle are individually selectable.
o Supports iostat -x and vmstsat output, providing a header line is added to
  the start of the file (see below).
o Has a GUI interface for statistics collection, allowing all the supported
  statistics to be collected in an ingegrated manner.

PREREQUISITES
-------------

StatsView is written in Perl5, using the Perl Tk extension library.  I recommend
that you use perl5.005_03 or later, and Tk800.014 or later, as StatsView has
been tested with these versions.  You will also need the Tk::GBARR add-on
package for this version.

The graphing is done with gnuplot, and version 3.7 or later is required -
a copy can be found in the gnuplot_src subdirectory.

INSTALLATION
------------

1.  Check you have all the prequisites installed and working.
2.  perl Makefile.PL; make install
3.  run "sv" or "sv <stats file>" to get started.
