    [Added]

    - Added CPAN::Testers::Backend::Fix::TesterNoname to fix testers who
      appear with `"NONAME"` in the test report list.

    - Added CPAN::Testers::Backend::ViewMetabaseCache to view legacy
      metabase cache entries to see how they differ from the actual test

      for all containers (instead of one per container).
    - Updated to Minion 8 which includes a new Admin UI
    - Fixed unprocessed report detection to work in pages instead of all at
      once.

0.002     2017-08-22 20:03:05-05:00 America/Chicago

    [Added]

    - Added new test report processing script,
      CPAN::Testers::Backend::ProcessReports (thanks @jberger!)
    - Added Minion job processing system via Beam::Minion
    - Added migration for metabase cache:
      CPAN::Testers::Backend::Migrate::MetabaseCache
    - Added logging to our container files. Now all processes in the
      backend get logged to STDERR (and syslog, though our syslog is not
      configured to put those logs anywhere useful).
