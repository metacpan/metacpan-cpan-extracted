This module implements TEA, the Tiny Encryption Algorithm, and some
Modes of Use based on CBC, compatibly in both Perl and JavaScript.
This enables CGI scripts to communicate with browsers, as well
as working as a normal private-key strong-encryption engine.

Subroutines offer encryption, decryption & digest, and all cyphertext
is ascii-encoded to prevent munging. Another routine returns JavaScript
code with identical functions, and this can be used by CGIs to feed to
a browser. A wrapper executable 'tea' is included for command-line use.

Crypt::Tea_JS is the continuation of Crypt::Tea under another name.
(Microsoft systems confused the old name with a different module
Crypt::TEA and were unable to install both).  The calling interface
is identical.  Since this change, Crypt::Tea_JS offers:
 * since 2.13, the New Improved version of the Tea algorithm
   is used, which provides even stronger encryption.
 * implementation in C of some of the core routines, for improved
   performance (at the server, if you're using it in a CGI context).
 * since 2.23, it reverts to PurePerl if the C library is missing at
   load-time, to make it easier for apps to bundle their whole stack.

To install just:
	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install
