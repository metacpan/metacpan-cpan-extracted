VERSION
    version 1.03

SYNOPSIS
        use Mojolicious::Plugin::Authorization
        $self->plugin('Authorization' => {
            'has_priv'   => sub { ... },
            'is_role'    => sub { ... },
            'user_privs' => sub { ... },
            'user_role'  => sub { ... },
        });
        if ($self->has_priv('delete_all', { optional => 'extra data stuff' })) {
            ...
        }

DESCRIPTION
    A very simple API implementation of role-based access control (RBAC).
    This plugin is only an API you will have to do all the work of setting
    up your roles and privileges and then provide four subs that are used by
    the plugin. The plugin expects that the current session will be used to
    get the role its privileges. It also assumes that you have already been
    authenticated and your role set. That is about it you are free to
    implement any system you like.

METHODS
  has_priv('privilege', $extra_data) or has_privilege('privilege', $extra_data)
    'has_priv' and 'has_privilege' will use the supplied `has_priv'
    subroutine ref to check if the current session has the given privilege.
    Returns true when the session has the privilege or false otherwise. You
    can pass additional data along in the extra_data hashref and it will be
    passed to your `has_priv' subroutine as-is.

  is('role',$extra_data) / is_role('role,$extra_data)
    'is' / 'is_role' will use the supplied `is_role' subroutine ref to check
    if the current session is the given role. Returns true when the session
    has privilege or false otherwise. You can pass additional data along in
    the extra_data hashref and it will be passed to your `is_role'
    subroutine as-is.

  privileges($extra_data)
    'privileges' will use the supplied `user_privs' subroutine ref and
    return the privileges of the current session. You can pass additional
    data along in the extra_data hashref and it will be passed to your
    `user_privs' subroutine as-is. The returned data is dependant on the
    supplied `user_privs' subroutine.

  role($extra_data)
    'role' will use the supplied `user_role' subroutine ref and return the
    role of the current session. You can pass additional data along in the
    extra_data hashref and it will be passed to your `user_role' subroutine
    as-is. The returned data is dependant on the supplied `user_role'
    subroutine.

CONFIGURATION
    The following options must be set for the plugin:

    has_priv (REQUIRED) A coderef for checking to see if the current session
    has a privilege (see "HAS PRIV").
    is_role (REQUIRED) A coderef for checking to see if the current session
    is a certain role (see "IS ROLE").
    user_privs (REQUIRED) A coderef for returning the privileges of the
    current session (see "PRIVILEGES").
    user_role (REQUIRED) A coderef for retiring the role of the current
    session (see "ROLE").

  HAS PRIV
    'has_priv' is used when you need to confirm that the current session has
    the given privilege. The coderef you pass to the `has_priv'
    configuration key has the following signature:

        sub {
            my ($app, $privilege,$extradata) = @_;
            ...
        }

    You must return either 0 for a fail and 1 for a pass. This allows
    `ROUTING VIA CONDITION' to work correctly.

  IS / IS ROLE
    'is' / 'is_role' is used when you need to confirm that the current
    session is set to the given role. The coderef you pass to the `is_role'
    configuration key has the following signature:

        sub {
            my ($app, $role, $extradata) = @_;
            ...
            return $role;
        }

    You must return either 0 for a fail and 1 for a pass. This allows
    `ROUTING VIA CONDITION' to work correctly.

  PRIVILEGES
    'privileges' is used when you need to get all the privileges of the
    current session. The coderef you pass to the `user_privs' configuration
    key has the following signature:

        sub {
            my ($app,$extradata) = @_;
            ...
            return $privileges;
        }

    You can return anything you want. It would normally be an arrayref of
    privileges but you are free to return a scalar, hashref, arrayref,
    blessed object, or undef.

  ROLE
    'role' is used when you need to get the role of the current session. The
    coderef you pass to the `user_privs' configuration key has the following
    signature:

        sub {
            my ($app,$extradata) = @_;
            ...
            return $role;
        }
    
    You can return anything you want. It would normally be just a scalar but
    you are free to return a scalar, hashref, arrayref, blessed object, or
    undef.

EXAMPLES
    For a code example using this, see the t/01-functional.t test, it uses
    Mojolicious::Lite and this plugin.

ROUTING VIA CONDITION
    This plugin also exports a routing condition you can use in order to
    limit access to certain documents to only sessions that have a
    privilege.

        $r->route('/delete_all')->over(has_priv => 'delete_all')->to('mycontroller#delete_all');
        my $delete_all_only = $r->route('/members')->over(has_priv => 'delete_all')->to('members#delete_all');
        $delete_all_only->route('delete')->to('members#delete_all');

    If the session does not have the 'delete_all' privilege, these routes
    will not be considered by the dispatcher and unless you have set up a
    catch-all route, a 404 Not Found will be generated instead.

    Another condition you can use to limit access to certain documents to
    only those sessions that have a role.

        $r->route('/view_all')->over(is => 'ADMIN')->to('mycontroller#view_all');
        my $view_all_only = $r->route('/members')->over(is => 'view_all')->to('members#view_all');
        $view_all_only->route('view')->to('members#view_all');

    If the session is not the 'ADMIN' role, these routes will not be
    considered by the dispatcher and unless you have set up a catch-all
    route, a 404 Not Found will be generated instead. This behavior is
    similar to the "has" condition.

ROUTING VIA CALLBACK
    It is not recommended to route un-authorized requests to anything but a
    404 page. If you do route to some sort of 'You are not allowed page' you
    are telling a hacker that the URL was correct while the 404 tells them
    nothing. This is just my opinion.
