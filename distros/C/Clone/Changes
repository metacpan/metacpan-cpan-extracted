  - fix typo in croak message (Salvatore Bonaccorso)

0.32  2012-11-22 12:14:07  garu
  - Stop skipping SvROK handling for all magical scalars. This fixes
    RT issues 67105, 79730 and 80201 (FLORA).
  - making the Changes file compliant to the CPAN::Changes spec (GARU).
  - Fixing tests when Scalar::Util::weaken is not available. As a
    result, tests should now pass even in odd OpenBSD versions (GARU).
  - removed dubious documentation on the optional parameter until
    it is 'fixed'. Right now it just increases the refcount when it's 0,
    and clones otherwise (which isn't exactly what it says). This
    fixes RT issue 57773 (GARU).
  - updated remark on Storable's dclone() to address RT issue 50174 (GARU)
  - updated Makefile.PL to include test dependencies (GARU)

0.31  2009-01-20 04:54:37  ray

0.30  2008-12-14 03:33:14  ray
  - Updating log: Applied patches from RT # 40957 and #41551.

0.28  2008-12-14 03:31:33  ray
  - Updating log: Made a change in CLONE_KEY to the way Clone stores refs in
    the ref hash.
  - Perl no longer uses the SvANY part of the SV struct in the same way which
    means the old way of storing the hash key is no longer unique.
    Thanks to Slaven Rezic for the patch.

0.27  2008-12-14 03:30:40  ray
  - Updating Log: Latest patch from Ruslan Zakirov. Patched another
    memory leak.

0.24  2007-07-25 03:33:57  ray
  - Bug fix for 5.9.*, for some reason the 'visible' logic is no longer
    working. I #if 'ed it out until I figure out what is going on.

    some memory leaks.
