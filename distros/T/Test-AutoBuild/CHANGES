   to pack when create struct data). (From Tobias Nijweide)

v1.2.0: (21-08-2006)
--------------------

 * Completely modular build workflow engine to allow the operation
   of the builder to be extended & customized at will
 * Extract changelogs since last build cycle for most repository
   types
 * Addition of Mercurial repository type
 * Lock file can now be obtained using Fcntl to allow reliable
   operation over NFS

 * Expose more environment variables to build control file 
 * Pass through a temporary filename to build control file to allow unit

   main build control file
