Revision history for mod_perl module Apache::AuthCAS

Release 0.5
===========
Sun Mar 23 15:23:09 PDT 2008
	- fixed a security vulnerability where a tainted cookie could be sent
	  by a malicious user and it would be used in an SQL query without
	  protection against SQL injection.  All database calls have been updated
	  to use bind parameters to prevent this possibility.
	- patch to allow for DBs other than PostgreSQL

Release 0.4
===========
1.7  Tue Oct 12 17:33:24 PDT 2004
	- fixed a bug which made AuthCAS only initialize once.  This meant that
	  only one configuration could be used on any host properly.  Fixed to
	  allow single-configuration setups for speed with STATIC_INITIALIZATION
	  flag.  This "enhancement" sneaked into 0.3 without being logged below =P

Tue Oct 12 16:18:38 PDT 2004
	- spec file generated with cpan2rpm and then modified.  The old file was
      broken

Release 0.3
===========
1.6  Tue Oct 05 15:37:00 2004
	- redirect user to error page instead of login in the invalid PGT case.
	  This will prevent looping redirects in the case there is a
      misconfiguration
	- static configuration initialization (initially not logged)

1.5  Tue Oct 05 15:26:00 2004
	- fixed a bug that was causing invalid PGT to be used when CAS session had
	  expired

Release 0.2
===========

1.4  Wed Sep 15 13:07:00 2004
    - fixed wrong package name Apache::CAS to Apache::AuthCAS

Release 0.1
===========
1.3  Wed Sep 15 11:41:00 2004
    - POD documentation update, had incorrect dependency listed
      Net::SSLeay was listed twice instead of including MIME::Base64

1.2  Wed Sep 15 11:26:00 2004
    - Changed session/pgt cleanup to a more consistent method
    - Initialization only occurs once, not hitting the directory
      config for every protected request
    - Added ability to masquerade as a "Basic Auth" module

1.0  Fri Aug 13 05:57:00 2004
