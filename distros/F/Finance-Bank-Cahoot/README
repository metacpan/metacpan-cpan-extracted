NAME
    Finance::Bank::Cahoot - Check your Cahoot bank accounts from Perl

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides a rudimentary interface to the Cahoot online
    banking system at "https://www.cahoot.com/". You will need either
    "Crypt::SSLeay" or "IO::Socket::SSL" installed for HTTPS support to work
    with WWW::Mechanize.

SYNOPSIS
      my $cahoot = Finance::Bank::Cahoot->new(credentials => 'Constant',
                                              credentials_options => {
                                                 account => '12345678',
                                                 password => 'verysecret',
                                                 place => 'London',
                                                 date => '01/01/1906',
                                                 username => 'dummy',
                                                 maiden => 'Smith' } );

      my $accounts = $cahoot->accounts;
      $cahoot->set_account($accounts->[0]->{account});
      my $snapshot = $cahoot->snapshot;
      foreach my $row (@$snapshot) {
        print join ',', @$row; print "\n";
      }

METHODS
    new Create a new instance of a connection to the Cahoot server.

        "new" can be called in two different ways. It can take a single
        parameter, "credentials", which will accept an already created
        credentials object, of type
        "Finance::Bank::Cahoot::CredentialsProvider::*". Alternatively, it
        can take two parameters, "credentials" and "credentials_options". In
        this case "credentials" is the name of a credentials class to create
        an instance of, and "credentials_options" is a hash of the options
        to pass-through to the constructor of the chosen class.

        If the second form of "new" is being used, and the chosen class is
        *not* one of the ones supplied as standard then it will need to be
        "required" first.

        If any errors occur then "new" will "croak".

          my $cahoot = Finance::Bank::Cahoot->new(credentials => 'Constant',
                                                  credentials_options => {
                                                     account => '12345678',
                                                     password => 'verysecret',
                                                     place => 'London',
                                                     date => '01/01/1906',
                                                     username => 'dummy',
                                                     maiden => 'Smith' } );

          # Or create the credentials object ourselves
          my $credentials = Finance::Bank::Cahoot::CredentialsProvider::Constant->new(
             account => '12345678', password => 'verysecret', place => 'London',
             date => '01/01/1906', username => 'dummy', maiden => 'Smith' } );
          my $cahoot = Finance::Bank::Cahoot->new(credentials => $credentials);

    login
        Login to the Cahoot server using the credentials supplied to "new".
        This method is implicit for all data access methods, so typically
        does not need to be called explicitly. The method takes no arguments
        and will only call one of memorable place, date or mother's maiden
        name as expected by the Cahoot portal.

    accounts
        Returns a list reference containing a summary of any accounts
        available from the supplied credentials. If a login has yet to occur
        "accounts" will automatically do this.

          my $accounts = $cahoot->accounts;

        Each item in the list is a hash reference that holds summary
        information for a single account, and contains this data:

        name - the text name of the account
        account - the account number
        balance - the current balance of the account
        available - the currently available funds (including any overdrafts)

    set_account
        Select an account for data retrieval using an 8-digit account
        number. If a login has yet to occur or a list of accounts has yet to
        be retrieved, "set_account" will automatically do this and cache the
        results.

          my @accounts = $cahoot->accounts;
          $cahoot->set_account($accounts->[0]->{account});

          # Or without first loading a list of accounts
          $cahoot->set_account('12345678);

    statements
        Returns a list reference containing a summary of all statements
        available for an account. When called with the optional parameter
        containing an 8-digit account number, "statements" will
        automatically login (if required) and select that account.

        If no account has been selected and no account is supplied by the
        caller, "statements" will "croak".

        Each item in the returned list is a hash reference that holds
        summary information for a single statement, and contains this data:

        description - a text description of the date of the statement,
        typically in the form "DD/MM/YY - DD/MM/YY"
        start - the date of the start of the statement as a time as returned
        by the "time" function.
        end - the date of the end of the statement as a time as returned by
        the "time" function.

    set_statement
        Select a statement for data retrieval using a statement description
        previously returned from "statements". The text description of the
        statement must be supplied as a parameter to the method and an
        account must have been selected using "set_account". If no account
        has been selected or no statement name is supplied by the caller,
        "statement" will "croak".

          $cahoot->set_account('12345678);
          my $statements = $cahoot->statements;
          $cahoot->set_statement($statements->[0]->{description});

    debits
        Return a list of direct debits currently active on the account. An
        optional account parameter may be supplied as an 8-digit account
        number. If no account has previously been selected or no account
        number is supplied, "debits" will "croak". The return value is a
        reference to a list of "Finance::Bank::Cahoot::DirectDebit" objects.
        Each entry in the list is a single direct debit.

          $cahoot->set_account('12345678');
          my $debits = $cahoot->debits;
          foreach my $debit (@$debits) {
            print $debit->payee, q{,},
                  $debit->reference, q{,},
                  $debit->amount || 0, q{,},
                  $debit->date || 0, q{,},
                  $debit->frequency || 0, qq{\n};
          }

    snapshot
        Return a table of transactions from the account snapshot. An
        optional account parameter may be supplied as an 8-digit account
        number. If no account has previously been selected or no account
        number is supplied, "snapshot" will "croak". The return value is a
        reference to a list of list references. Each entry in the top-level
        list is a row in the statement and the rows are data from the
        account in the order date, description, amount withdrawn, amount
        paid in.

          $cahoot->set_account('12345678');
          my $snapshot = $cahoot->snapshot;
          foreach my $row (@$snapshot) {
            print join ',', @$row; print "\n";
          }

    statement
        Return a table of transactions from a selected statement. An
        optional account parameter may be supplied as an 8-digit account
        number. If no account has previously been selected or no account
        number is supplied, "statement" will "croak". The return value is a
        reference to a list of "Finance::Bank::Cahoot::Statement::Entry"
        objects. Each entry in list is a row in the statement.

          $cahoot->set_account('12345678');
          my $statement = $cahoot->statement;
          foreach my $transaction (@$statement) {
            print $transaction->date, q{,},
                  $transaction->details, q{,},
                  $transaction->credit || 0, q{,},
                  $transaction->debit || 0, q{,},
                  $transaction->balance || 0, qq{\n};
          }

WARNING
    This warning is from Simon Cozens' "Finance::Bank::LloydsTSB", and seems
    just as apt here.

    This is code for online banking, and that means your money, and that
    means BE CAREFUL. You are encouraged, nay, expected, to audit the source
    of this module yourself to reassure yourself that I am not doing
    anything untoward with your banking data. This software is useful to me,
    but is provided under NO GUARANTEE, explicit or implied.

NOTES
    This has only been tested on my own accounts. I imagine it should work
    on any account types, but I can't guarantee this.
