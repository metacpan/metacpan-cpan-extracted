Description

    This module implements filters and common constraints in builtin
    methods and uses a factory pattern to implement an extensible list of
    external filters and constraints

    Data values are filtered first before testing against the constraints.
    The filtered data values are returned if they conform to the
    constraints, otherwise an exception is thrown

Configuration and Environment

    Defines the following attributes;

    constraints

      Hash containing constraint attributes. Keys are the id values passed
      to "check_field". See Data::Validation::Constraints

    fields

      Hash containing field definitions. Keys are the id values passed to
      "check_field". Each field definition can contain a space separated
      list of filters to apply and a space separated list of constraints.
      Each constraint method must return true for the value to be accepted

      The constraint method can also be a list of methods separated by |
      (pipe) characters. This has the effect of requiring only one of the
      constraints to be true

         isMandatory isHexadecimal|isValidNumber

      This constraint would require a value that was either hexadecimal or
      a valid number

    filters

      Hash containing filter attributes. Keys are the id values passed to
      "check_field". See Data::Validation::Filters

    level

      Positive integer defaults to 1. Used to select the stack frame from
      which to throw the check_field exception

Subroutines/Methods

 check_form

       $form = $dv->check_form( $prefix, $form );

    Calls "check_field" for each of the keys in the form hash. In the calls
    to "check_field" the form keys have the prefix prepended to them to
    create the key to the fields hash

    If one of the fields constraint names is compare, then the fields value
    is compared with the value for another field. The constraint attribute
    other_field determines which field to compare and the operator
    constraint attribute gives the comparison operator which defaults to eq

    All fields are checked. Multiple error objects are stored, if they
    occur, in the args attribute of the returned error object

 check_field

       $value = $dv->check_field( $id, $value );

    Checks one value for conformance. The id is used as a key to the fields
    hash whose validate attribute contains the list of space separated
    constraint names. The value is tested against each constraint in turn.
    All tests must pass or the subroutine will use the EXCEPTION_CLASS
    class to throw an error

Diagnostics

    None

Dependencies

    Moo

    Try::Tiny

    Unexpected

Incompatibilities

    OpenDNS. I have received reports that hosts configured to use OpenDNS
    fail the isValidHostname test. Apparently OpenDNS causes the core Perl
    function gethostbyname to return it's argument rather than undefined as
    per the documentation

Bugs and Limitations

    There are no known bugs in this module. Please report problems to

    welcome
