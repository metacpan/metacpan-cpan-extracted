lib::byversion

So you have >1 Perl Installs. You have >1 Perl installs right? And you
switch between running them how?

Let me guess, somewhere you have code that sets a different value for
PERL5LIB depending on what Perl you're using. Oh you use "perlbrew"?
<http://grep.cpan.me/?q=PERL5LIB+dist=App-perlbrew>

This is a slightly different approach:

1. Set up your user-land PERL5LIB directories in a regular pattern
differing only by "perl" version
        $HOME/Foo/Bar/5.16.0/lib/...
        $HOME/Foo/Bar/5.16.1/lib/...
        $HOME/Foo/Bar/5.16.2/lib/...

2. Set the following in your %ENV
        PERL5OPT="-Mlib::byversion='$HOME/Foo/Bar/%V/lib/...'"

3. Done!
    The right PERL5LIB gets loaded based on which "perl" you use.

Yes, yes, catch 22, "lib::byversion" and its dependencies need to be in
your lib to start with.

O.k. That is a problem, slightly. But assuming you can get that in each
"perl" install somehow, you can load each "perl"'s user library
directories magically with this module once its loaded.

And "assuming you can get that in each "perl" install somehow" =~ with a
bit of luck, this feature or something like it might just be added to
Perl itself, as this is just a prototype idea to prove it works ( or as
the case may be, not ).

And even if that never happens, and you like this module, you can still
install this module into all your "perl"'s and keep a separate
"user-PERL5LIB-per-perl" without having to use lots of scripts to hold
it together, and for System Perls, you may even be fortunate enough to
get this module shipped by your "OS" of choice. Wouldn't that be dandy.

INSTALLATION

This is a Perl module distribution. It should be installed with whichever
tool you use to manage your installation of Perl, e.g. any of

  cpanm .
  cpan  .
  cpanp -i .

Consult http://www.cpan.org/modules/INSTALL.html for further instruction.
Should you wish to install this module manually, the procedure is

  perl Makefile.PL
  make
