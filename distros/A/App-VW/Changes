FUTURE
* Add support for more Linux distributions:
  + centos (and other redhat derivatives)
  + gentoo (they have a nice init system)
* What about *BSDs and systems that don't use anything resembling SysV init?
* Don't hardcode the path to perl in the init scripts.  Use $Config{perlpath}.
* Optionally downgrade user to someone who isn't root.
* Add more documentation.
