Emacs-Run-ExtractDocs

A perl/elisp lash-up to extract the docstrings from an
elisp file to a html page.

As of version 0.2, this is now a Module::Build-based project.
Version 0.3 fixes dependencies (so that tests have a hope of passing).

INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

	perl Build.PL
	./Build
	./Build test
	./Build install
        sudo cp lisp/extract-doctrings.el /usr/share/emacs/site-lisp
        (or some other location in your emacs load-path)

Note that last manual installation step (this is unfortunately
standard for CPAN packages containing emacs lisp code).

DEPENDENCIES

This module depends on having Gnu/emacs installed on the system
(it might work with xemacs but this is untested).

This module requires these other modules and libraries:
   Class::Base
   Emacs::Run

The tests require:
   Test::Differences
   Test::More
