NAME
    LUGS::Events::Parser - Event parser for the Linux User Group Switzerland

SYNOPSIS
     use LUGS::Events::Parser;

     $parser = LUGS::Events::Parser->new($events_file);

     while ($event = $parser->next_event) {
         $date = $event->get_event_date;
         ...
     }

DESCRIPTION
    "LUGS::Events::Parser" parses the events file of the Linux User Group
    Switzerland (LUGS). It offers according accessor methods and may
    optionally filter HTML markup.

CONSTRUCTOR
  new
    Creates a new "LUGS::Events::Parser" object.

    Without options:

     $parser = LUGS::Events::Parser->new('/path/to/events_file');

    With filtering options (example):

     $parser = LUGS::Events::Parser->new('/path/to/events_file', {
               filter_html  => 1,
               tag_handlers => {
                   'a href' => [ {
                       rewrite => '$TEXT - $HREF',
                       fields  => [ qw(location responsible) ],
                   } ],
               },
               purge_tags => [ qw(responsible) ],
               strip_text => [ 'mailto:' ],
     });

    *   "filter_html"

        Extract HTML and rewrite it. Accepts a boolean.

    *   "tag_handlers"

        Handlers for rewriting HTML. See "TAG HANDLERS" for a format
        explanation.

    *   "purge_tags"

        Optionally purge all remaining tags without attribute values.
        Accepts an array reference with field names.

    *   "strip_text"

        Optionally strip text from filtered content. Accepts an array
        reference with literals.

FILTERING AND REWRITING
    Filtering HTML markup and separating it from plaintext is optional and
    may be enabled via the "filter_html" option. The "filter_html" option
    set on its own does not suffice since no according tag handlers are
    defined which must be provided by the "tag_handlers" option. Remaining
    tags without attribute values may be purged by the "purge_tags" option.
    The "strip_text" option may contain literal strings to be removed from
    the filtered and rewritten content.

    The order of processing is: HTML markup is filtered first and then being
    rewritten by the according tag handlers. Next tags are purged if
    requested. Then literal strings as specified are stripped from the
    content. Finally, HTML entities are unconditionally decoded.

    "LUGS::Events::Parser" internally uses HTML::Parser to push tags and
    text on a stack. If tags are nested, the innermost tag will be retrieved
    first and the outermost tag last. The top of the stack will be removed
    after the data for each tag set has been gathered completely.

TAG HANDLERS
    HTML markup is rewritten through the tag handlers provided within the
    options of the constructor. The handlers of a tag group are referenced
    by either its tagname or its tagname and an attribute name. Each handler
    must consist of a mandatory "rewrite" and "fields" entry. The "rewrite"
    entry defines the substitute pattern for HTML markup (i.e., start tag,
    text and end tag) found. The pattern may consist of placeholders (e.g.,
    $NAME), simple text or both. It may also be empty (which has the effect
    of removing the markup and text entirely).

    For tags which enclose text, the placeholder $TEXT will represent the
    enclosed text. If attributes are available, for example "href", then
    $HREF will contain the value of the "href" attribute. Placeholders
    provided for standalone tags will not be substituted.

    The "fields" entry contains the field names to which rewriting applies.
    Specifying a literal "*" will match all field names.
