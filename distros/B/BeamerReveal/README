NAME

    beamer-reveal.pl - converts the .rvl file and the corresponding pdf
    file to a full reveal website

VERSION

    version 20260123.1702

SYNOPSIS

    beamer-reveal.pl [--help | -h] [--man|-m] <jobname>

DESCRIPTION

    The beamer-reveal.pl script reads a beamer-reveal (.rvl) driver file
    together with the .pdf file (both generated by LaTeX) and converts
    beamer slides to a working reveal website.

    Starting by reading the documentation of the LaTeX package makes sense.
    We recommend reading this documentation after that.

 The .rvl file

    The syntax will be documented as soon as it reaches stability.

 The configuration file

    There is not configuration file.

NAME

    beamer-reveal.pl - from beamer slides to reveal presentation

OPTIONS

    --help | -h

      prints help message on standard output

    --man | -m

      prints manual page on standard output

    --output-directory | -o

      target directory where the reveal html files will end up in. Defaults
      to '.'.

    --aux-directory | -a

      directory where the rvl file (and other auxiliary files) will be read
      from. Defaults to the pdf-directory.

    --pdf-directory | -p

      directory where the PDF file of your beamer-presentation is stored.
      Defaults to '.'.

ARGUMENT

    <jobname>

      basename of your latex input file; this will allow spel-wizard.pl to
      find the .aux file and the .spelidx file.

RETURN VALUE

    The return value is not meaningful. The project is not mature enough
    and its use mode is unsufficiently known to implement the appropriate
    return value strategy.

BUGS

    No bugs have been reported so far. If you find any, please, send an
    e-mail to the author containing:

    - what you were trying;

    - enough data such that I can reproduce your attempt (.tex file, .rvl
    file, .brlog file and the jobname_files directory created by the
    script;

    - what strange behavior you observed;

    - what normal behavior you would have expected.
