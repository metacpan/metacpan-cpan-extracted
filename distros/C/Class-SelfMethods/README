      no strict;

      my $foo = MyClass->new( name => 'foo' );
      my $bar = MyClass->new( name => 'bar', friendly => 'Bar');
      my $bas = MyClass->new( name => 'bas',
                              friendly => sub {
                                my $self = shift;
                                return ucfirst($self->_friendly);
                              }
                            );

      print $foo->friendly, "\n";
      print $bar->friendly, "\n";
      print $bas->friendly, "\n";

      $bas->friendly_SET('a reset friendly');
      print $bas->friendly, "\n";

      $bas->friendly_SET( sub { my $self = shift; return uc($self->_friendly) });
      print $bas->friendly, "\n";

      $bas->friendly_CLEAR;
      print $bas->friendly, "\n";

DESCRIPTION
    Development of this module has largely lapsed due to the superior
    performance and feature set of "Class::Prototyped". If you haven't
    written code that depends upon "Class::SelfMethods", I strongly urge you
    to look at "Class::Prototyped" first.

    "Class::SelfMethods" merges some features of other Object Oriented
    languages to build a system for implementing more flexible objects than
    is provided by default in Perl.

    The core features I was looking for when I wrote "Class::SelfMethods"
    were:

    Class-based inheritance hierarchy
        I wanted to retain Perl's normal class-based inheritance hierarchy
        rather than to write (or use) a completely prototype based system.
        If you are looking for a purely prototype based system, see Sean M.
        Burke's "Class::Classless". My reasoning on this is that it is
        easier in file based languages (as opposed to world based languages
        like Self) to code class based inheritance hierarchies (which are
        largely static) than to code object based inheritance hierarchies
        (since objects in such languages have a dynamicism that is not
        granted to classes).

    Instance-defined method overriding
        I wanted instances to be able to override their class-defined
        methods. In the example above, the "$bas" object has its own
        "friendly" method. Instance-defined methods are passed the exact
        same parameter list as class-defined methods.

    Subroutine/Attribute equivalence
        Borrowing from Self, I wanted to be able to treat methods and
        attributes similarly. For instance, in the above example the "$bar"
        object has an attribute "friendly", whereas the "$bas" object has a
        method "friendly", and the "$foo" object uses the class-defined
        method. The calling syntax is independent of the implementation.
        Parameters can even be passed in the method call and they will
        simply be ignored if the method is implemented by a simple attribute

    In addition to those core features, I (and Damian) had a wish list of
    additional features:

    Simple syntax
        I wanted the system to be reasonable easy to use for both
        implementers of classes and users of objects. Simple syntax for
        users is more important than simple syntax for implementers.

    Full support for "SUPER" type concepts
        I wanted instance-defined methods to be able to call the
        class-defined methods they replace.

    Support for calling methods at instantiation time
        In some circumstances, rather than deal with multiple inheritance it
        is easier to have a class-defined object method that sets up the
        various instance-defined methods for a given object. To support
        this, the "new" method allows deferred method calls to be passed in
        as parameters.

    Modifying objects post-instantiation
        I originally had no need for modifying objects post-instantiation,
        but Damian Conway thought it would be a Good Thing (TM) to support.
        Being so very good at these sorts of thing, he instantly came up
        with a good general syntax to support such. Method calls that end in
        a "_SET" result in the first parameter being assigned to the
        attribute/method. I noticed one remaining hole and added support for
        "_CLEAR".

HOW TO
  Write A Class

    Your class should inherit from "Class::SelfMethods". The class-defined
    instance methods should be defined with a leading underscore and should
    be called without a leading underscore. Don't do anything silly like
    writing methods whose proper names have a leading underscore and whose
    definitions have two leading underscores - that's just asking for
    trouble.

    Do not, of course, make use of attributes that have leading underscores
    - that's also just asking for trouble. Also, do not access attributes
    directly (i.e. "$self->{foo}"). That will prevent people who use your
    class from substituting a method for an attribute. Instead, always read
    attributes by making the corresponding method call ("$self->foo").

    If you need to call "SUPER::methodname", call "SUPER::_methodname".

  Create An Instance

    The default "new" method uses named parameters. Unless you are
    certifiable, you will too. To specify attributes, simply use the syntax
    "name => 'value'" and to specify a method use "name => sub { my $self =
    shift; . . . }". Note that methods and attributes are interchangeable.

  Modify An Instance

    Method calls that end in a "_SET" will result in their first parameter
    being assigned to the appropriate attribute/method. For instance, in the
    "SYNOPSIS" I use "$foo->friendly_SET" to specify both a value and a
    method for "friendly". Method calls that end in a "_CLEAR" will delete
    that attribute/method from the object. The "can" method will behave just
    like "UNIVERSAL::can" - it returns a code reference that will
    interoperate with the associated object properly using the
    "$obj->$coderef()" syntax. For examples of usage, see "test.pl".

  Installation instructions

INTERNALS
  can

    This implementation of "can" is the heart of the system. By making "can"
    responsible for almost everything relating to accessing the objects, the
    code for deciding how to respond to the various situtations is kept in
    one place.

    In order to get major speed improvements (a factor of 2 to 3 for
    attribute retrieval and method calls), extensive symbol table
    manipulation was used to build methods on the fly that react
    appropriately.

    The three types of methods are "_SET" methods, "_CLEAR" methods, and
    "normal" methods. The first two are fairly straight forward as far as
    implementation goes. First "UNIVERSAL::can" is called to determine
    whether an appropriate entry has been made in the package symbol table.
    If not, an anonymous subroutine (actually, a closure in this case
    because "$func" is a lexically scoped variable defined outside the
    anonymous subroutine and referenced from within) is created and assigned
    into the package symbol table. In either case, a reference to the
    appropriate closure is returned (normal "can" behavior is to return a
    reference to the code or "undef" if the method call is not legal).

    The "normal" methods are somewhat trickier. The outer "if" statement
    exists to ensure that "can" returns "undef" for illegal method calls
    (remember that there may be situations where "$self->can($func)" should
    return false even though "UNIVERSAL::can($self, $func)" returns true).
    It then checks whether an appropriate entry has been made in the package
    symbol table. If not, it builds a closure that will do the trick.
    Remember that the closure could get called on an object that is in any
    of the four possible states - attribute, instance method, inherited
    method, or illegal. The closure includes the logic to test for instance
    methods and attributes, but if neither are present it will make the call
    to "_method" regardless of whether or not there is an inherited method
    with the proper name. It relies on "AUTOLOAD" to properly deal with
    unhandled "_method" calls.

  AUTOLOAD

    "AUTOLOAD" gets called the first time a given method call is made. It
    first strips off the package name from the function call to extract the
    actual function name. It then checks to see if the function name starts
    with an underscore. If it does, it's a failed call from the "normal"
    method closure, so "AUTOLOAD" calls "croak" to die with the appropriate
    error message. Notice that the underscore has been stripped off, so it
    will "die" failing to find "method".

    "AUTOLOAD" then calls "can", which will return a reference to the
    appropriate "CODE" entity if the method call is supported. At the same
    time, "can" puts an entry into the symbol table for "Class::SelfMethods"
    to support future calls to that method. "AUTOLOAD" jumps to that "CODE"
    entity if a valid entity was return. Otherwise, execution continues on
    to another "croak" call.

  new

    The "new" method supplied in "Class::SelfMethods" provides one
    interesting twist on an otherwise standard named parameters constructor.
    It strips out any passed parameters that have leading underscores and
    stores them away. It then creates the hash ref from the remaining
    parameters and blesses it appropriately. Finally, it takes the stored
    parameters that have leading underscores and makes the matching method
    calls - the key is used for the method name and the value is
    dereferenced to an array and passed as parameters.

CREDITS
    Damian Conway, damian@cs.monash.edu.au
        Responsible for accessor methods, module name, constructive
        criticism and moral support. After I responded to Sean's suggestion
        of implementing a "can" method, Damian completely rewrote my first
        attempt by routing everything through "can". He also was the first
        to point out direct symbol table manipulation by implementing it for
        the "_SET" and "_CLEAR" methods. I rebutted his routing everything
        through "can" by doing performance testing. He agreed that the
        performance issues were a problem, but suggested retaining the
        direct symbol table for the accessor methods. It was then that the
        lightbulb went off and I realized that a properly written closure
        could be used for the normal method calls. Damian's criticisms kept
        me on track and from making a fool of myself, and the result is some
        very fast (and I hope safe:) code.

        I first started writing to Damian as a result of an excellent book
        he wrote, Object Oriented Perl. I highly recommend it - get it, read
        it.

    Sean M. Burke, sburke@netadventure.net
        Suggested implementing a "can" method. Sean was/is responsible for
