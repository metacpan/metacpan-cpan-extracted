        - Generalized `make_deflate_tables()` to generate tables for arbitrarily large distances and match lengths.
        - Generalized `deflate_encode()` to encode arbitrarily large distances and arbitrarily large match lengths.

        - Better compression ratio in `lz77_compress()`.

        [CHANGES]

        - Renamed `bz2_compress` and `bz2_decompress` to `bwt_compress` and `bwt_decompress`, respectively.

            $Compression::Util::LZ77_MIN_LEN
            $Compression::Util::LZ77_MAX_LEN

        ...which control the minimum and maximum lenght of a match in LZSS/lZ77 encoding.
        - Added support for exporting package variables with `use Compression::Util qw($PACKAGE_VARIABLE)`.
