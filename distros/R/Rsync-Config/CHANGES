- Rsync::Config::Renderer hacks/refactorization:
  + moved options validation into private methods;
  + default options have their private method;
  + accessors may be called as class methods;
  + dropped dependency on Scalar::Util;
  + added "render" method;
  + documentation edit;
- refactorized "atoms" into "Blank", "Comment" and "Atom"
  ("Comment" and "Atom" inherit from "Blank");
- dropped ::Exceptions (switched to "in place" Exceptions for each module);
- random hacking (simplification, tweaks, fixes, etc):
  + dropped method chaining for add_* (returning the created object is more
  useful);
  + atoms may store "0" as name/value;
  + modules have an "indent_step" parameter (not so useful currently);
  + ...
- rewrote all tests (code coverage: 100%!)
