If you want to write new extension to dbMan, you can try with this backbone:

package DBIx::dbMan::Extension::Your_module;

use strict;
use vars qw/$VERSION @ISA/;
use DBIx::dbMan::Extension;

$VERSION = '0.01';
@ISA = qw/DBIx::dbMan::Extension/;

1;

sub IDENTIFICATION { return "YOUR-ID-STRINGS"; }

sub preference { return YOUR-PREFERENCE; }

sub handle_action {
	my ($obj,%action) = @_;

	# %action modification or something making

	$action{processed} = 1;
	return %action;
}




where Your_module change to name of your extension,
YOUR-ID-STRINGS is composition of three numbers:

	author ID
	extension ID
	version ID

please mail to <sorm@is4u.cz> for getting
author ID (your namespace). You can choose
extension ID yourself (e.g. start with 000001 and
go up). And of course you can choose version ID
(e.g. start with 000001 and go up). You must
turn version ID up when you modify and distribute
new version of extension.

And select YOUR-PREFERENCE:

	<0		for fallbacks and output routines
	0-999		for standard "something making" modules
	1000-1999	for command parsers
	2000-2999	for preprocessors
	3000-3999	for macroprocessors
	>=4000		for URGENT handlers

Your module in handle_action must parse
%action (especially $action{action})
and you can modify this action or
making something.

If you set $action{processed} to 1,
action is passed to next extension with low-or-same
preference (priority). If you undefine or zero
$action{processed}, %action is passed again to
top level extension.

You can use these objects:

	$obj->{-interface}
	$obj->{-dbi}
	$obj->{-config}
	$obj->{-mempool}

and (very carefully)

	$obj->{-core}

Good actions:

	$action{action} eq 'COMMAND'

	-> processing $action{cmd}

	$action{action} eq 'SQL'

	-> processing $action{sql}

	$action{action} eq 'SQL_RESULT'

	-> formatting $action{result}

	$action{action} eq 'OUTPUT'

	-> showing $action{output}

Recommended receipt for outputing to
console -> changing action to OUTPUT
and filling $action{output}.

If you process action totally, you
can change $action{action} to 'NONE'
-> nobody process these actions (I hope).

If dbMan start try 

	show extensions

and look for your module (started ?)

You can register good module (module=extension)
to distribution of dbMan by
mailing your module to <sorm@is4u.cz>
(your module appear on doc/MODULE list).

Good luck.
