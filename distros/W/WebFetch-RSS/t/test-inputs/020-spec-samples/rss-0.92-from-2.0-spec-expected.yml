  - 'It''s been a few days since I added a song to the Grateful Dead channel. Now
    that there are all these new Radio users, many of whom are tuned into this channel
    (it''s #16 on the hotlist of upstreaming Radio users, there''s no way of knowing
    how many non-upstreaming users are subscribing, have to do something about this..).
    Anyway, tonight''s song is a live version of Weather Report Suite from Dick''s
    Picks Volume 7. It''s wistful music. Of course a beautiful song, oft-quoted here
    on Scripting News. <i>A little change, the wind and rain.</i>'

  - Moshe Weitzman says Shakedown Street is what I'm lookin for for tonight. I'm listening
    right now. It's one of my favorites. "Don't tell me this town ain't got no heart."
    Too bright. I like the jazziness of Weather Report Suite. Dreamy and soft. How
    about The Other One? "Spanish lady come to me.."

  - 'Ed Cone: "Had a nice Deadhead experience with my wife, who never was one but
    gets the vibe and knows and likes a lot of the music. Somehow she made it to the
    age of 40 without ever hearing Wharf Rat. We drove to Jersey and back over Christmas
    with the live album commonly known as Skull and Roses in the CD player much of
    the way, and it was cool to see her discover one the band''s finest moments. That
    song is unique and underappreciated. Fun to hear that disc again after a few years
    off -- you get Jerry as blues-guitar hero on Big Railroad Blues and a nice version
    of Bertha."'
