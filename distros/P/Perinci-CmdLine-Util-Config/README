NAME
    Perinci::CmdLine::Util::Config - Utility routines related to config
    files

VERSION
    This document describes version 1.727 of Perinci::CmdLine::Util::Config
    (from Perl distribution Perinci-CmdLine-Util-Config), released on
    2025-11-15.

FUNCTIONS
  get_args_from_config
    Usage:

     get_args_from_config(%args) -> [$status_code, $reason, $payload, \%result_meta]

    "config" is a HoH (hashes of hashrefs) produced by reading an INI (IOD)
    configuration file using modules like Config::IOD::Reader.

    Hashref argument "args" will be set by parameters in "config", while
    "plugins" will be set by parameters in "[plugin=...]" sections in
    "config". For example, with this configuration:

     arg1=val1
     arg2=val2
     -special_arg1=val3
     -special_arg2=val4
 
     [plugin=DumpArgs]
     -event=before_validation
 
     [plugin=Foo]
     arg1=val1

    "args" will become:

     {
       arg1=>"val1",
       arg2=>"val2",
       -special_arg1=>"val3",
       -special_arg2=>"val4",
     }

    and "plugins" will become:

     [
       'DumpArgs@before_validation' => {},
       Foo => {arg1=>val},
     ]

    This function is not exported by default, but exportable.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   args => *hash*

        (No description)

    *   common_opts => *any*

        (No description)

    *   config => *any*

        (No description)

    *   config_profile => *any*

        (No description)

    *   meta => *any*

        (No description)

    *   meta_is_normalized => *any*

        (No description)

    *   plugins => *array*

        (No description)

    *   r => *any*

        (No description)

    *   subcommand_name => *any*

        (No description)

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element ($status_code) is an integer containing HTTP-like status
    code (200 means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second
    element ($reason) is a string containing error message, or something
    like "OK" if status is 200. Third element ($payload) is the actual
    result, but usually not present when enveloped result is an error
    response ($status_code is not 2xx). Fourth element (%result_meta) is
    called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information, much like how HTTP response headers provide additional
    metadata.

    Return value: (any)

  get_default_config_dirs
    Usage:

     get_default_config_dirs() -> [$status_code, $reason, $payload, \%result_meta]

    This function is not exported by default, but exportable.

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR,
    Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps
    required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
