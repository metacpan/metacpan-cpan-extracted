XML-DifferenceMarkup version 1.x
================================

This module implements an XML diff producing XML output. Both input
and output are DOM documents, as implemented by XML::LibXML. The
output format is meant to be human-readable (i.e. simple, as opposed
to short) - basically the diff is a subset of the input trees,
annotated with instruction element nodes specifying how to convert the
source tree to the target by inserting and deleting nodes.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires XML::LibXML and its dependencies (see the
documentation of XML::LibXML for the full list) and also the
libdiffmark library, available as part of the diffmark package from
http://www.mangrove.cz/diffmark/ . Consequently, it's an XS module,
whose compilation requires a C++ compiler. It's tested only with gcc
on Linux; it might work on other unix-like platforms, but probably not
on Windows.
