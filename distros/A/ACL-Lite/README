DESCRIPTION
    `ACL::Lite' is a simple permission checker without any prerequisites.

    `ACL' stands for "Access Control Lists".

  DEFAULT PERMISSION
    The default permission depends on whether you pass a `uid'
    (authenticated) or not (anonymous).

CONSTRUCTOR

    uid User identifier for authenticated users.

    permissions
        Granted permissions.

    separator
        Separator used to parse permission strings. Defaults to `,'.

  check $permissions, $uid
    Checks whether any of the permissions in $permissions is granted.
    Returns first permission which grants access.

  permissions
    Returns permissions as hash reference:

        $perms = $acl->permissions;

    Returns permissions as list:

        @perms = $acl->permissions;

CAVEATS
