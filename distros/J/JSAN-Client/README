NAME
    JSAN::Client - JSAN Client 2.0 (migrated from Class::DBI to ORLite)

SYNOPSIS
      # Create the client object
      my $client = JSAN::Client->new(
          prefix  => '/usr/local/js',
          verbose => 1,
      );
      
  # Install by library name
      $client->install_library('Display.Swap');
      
  # Install by distribution name
      $client->install_distribution('DOM.Trigger');

DESCRIPTION
    The "JSAN::Client" API intended to provide the highest-possible level
    abstraction for the process of installing JSAN distributions.

    However this class is still intended for developers, and won't do things
    like auto-detect your "JSAN_PREFIX" and so on.

    For more DWIM type functionality aimed at users, see the JSAN::Shell
    class, or even more preferably the jsan installer application.

METHODS
  new param => 'value', ...
    The "new" constructor takes a set of key/value params and creates a new
    JSAN installation client, who's purpose is to install JSAN distributions
    to a specific location on the local disk.

    Please note that although you can create multiple "JSAN::Client" objects
    for multiple install paths, all clients will share the common
    JSAN::Index and JSAN::Transport layers, which means both that
    distribution packages will be cached across all the clients, and that
    they must install from the same remote JSAN repository.

    The constructor takes the following parameters

    prefix
        The "prefix" params should be the location on the local disk that
        the JSAN libraries contained in the distribution should be installed
        to.

    verbose
        The "verbose" (current not implemented) enables verbose mode for the
        client.

        In verbose mode, the client will write a number of procedural and
        diagnostic messages to "STDOUT" as it processes the installation
        requests.

    Returns a new "JSAN::Client" object, or dies on error.

  prefix
    The "prefix" accessor returns the installation prefix path for the
    client.

  verbose
    The "verbose" accessor returns the boolean flag indicating whether the
    client is running in verbose mode. If called with argument - modifies
    the current 'verbose' value.

  build
    The "build" accessor returns the boolean flag indicating whether the
    client is running in build-time mode.

  install_library $name
    The "install_library" method takes the name of a JSAN library and
    installs the most recent release of the distribution that the library is
    contained in as indicated in the JSAN index.

    Any dependencies required for the library will also be installed as
    needed.

    Please note the difference between a JSAN "library" and a JSAN
    "distribution". There are often many libraries contained in a single
    distribution.

    Returns true if the library was installed, false if the library is
    already up to date and did not need to be installed, or dies on error.

  install_distribution $name
    The "install_distribution" method takes the name of a JSAN distribution
    and installs the most recent release of that distribution.

    Any dependencies required for the distribution will also be installed as
    needed.

    Please note the difference between a JSAN "library" and a JSAN
    "distribution". There are often many libraries contained in a single
    distribution.

    Returns true if the distribution was installed, false if the
    distribution is already up to date and did not need to be installed, or
    dies on error.

TO DO
    - Add the testing dependency algorithm variant

    - Add support for JSON META.yml files
