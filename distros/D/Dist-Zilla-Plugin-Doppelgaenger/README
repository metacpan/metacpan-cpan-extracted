SYNOPSIS
      [Doppelgaenger]
      source_module = Foo::Bar
      strip_pod = 1

DESCRIPTION
    This Dist::Zilla plugin creates a new CPAN distribution with a new name
    based on the latest stable distribution of a source module.

    Please do not do this without the permission of the authors or
    maintainers of the source.

    If the Changes files is flagged to be updated, you must have "{{$NEXT}}"
    in your Changes files and use the "NextRelease" plugin. The source
    distribution will be added on a line in the Changes file after
    "{{$NEXT}}". After release, your original Changes file might look
    something like this:

      0.001     2010-12-17 08:37:08 EST5EDT

        - Generated from AUTHOR/Foo-Bar-1.23.tar.gz

        - See https://metacpan.org/changes/release/AUTHOR/Foo-Bar-1.23 for details

    If you strip Pod, you may with to explore replacing it with new Pod
    using the Dist::Zilla::Plugin::AppendExternalData plugin.

ATTRIBUTES
  source_module (REQUIRED)
    The name of a CPAN module to imitate. E.g. Foo::Bar

  new_name
    The new name to use in place of the source name. Defaults to the
    converted form of the distribution name.

  cpan_mirror
    This is a URI to a CPAN mirror. It must be an 'http' URI. Defaults to
    "http://www.cpan.org/"

  strip_version
    Boolean for whether any assignments to $VERSION should be stripped out
    of the source. This is a crude hack and acts by killing a line of code
    containing such assignments. This obviously may not work in all cases
    and should be used with caution. Default is false.

  strip_pod
    Boolean for whether Pod should be stripped when copying from source.
    Default is false.

  changes_file
    Name of change log file. Defaults to 'Changes'.

  update_changes_file
    Boolean for whether change log should be updated with the source
    distribution when built. Default is true.

  exclude_filename
    To exclude certain files from being gathered, use the "exclude_filename"
    option. This may be used multiple times to specify multiple files to
    exclude.

  exclude_match
    This is just like "exclude_filename" but provides a regular expression
    pattern. Files matching the pattern are not gathered. This may be used
    multiple times to specify multiple patterns to exclude.
