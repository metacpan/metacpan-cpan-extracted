=head1 NAME

Fl::Tabs - "File Card Tabs" interface widget

=head1 Description

The Fl::Tabs is the "file card tabs" interface that allows you to put lots
and lots of buttons and switches in a panel, as popularized by many toolkits.

=for html <center><img src="http://www.fltk.org/doc-1.3/tabs.png" /></center>

A full example of this widget can be found in C<eg/tabs.pl>

Clicking the tab makes a child visible() by calling show() on it, and all
other children are made invisible by calling hide() on them. Usually the
children are Fl::Group widgets containing several widgets themselves.

Each child makes a card, and its label() is printed on the card tab, including
the label font and style. The selection color of that child is used to color
the tab, while the color of the child determines the background color of the
pane.

The size of the tabs is controlled by the bounding box of the children (there
should be some space between the children and the edge of the Fl::Tabs), and
the tabs may be placed "inverted" on the bottom - this is determined by which
gap is larger. It is easiest to lay this out in fluid, using the fluid browser
to select each child group and resize them until the tabs look the way you
want them to.

The background area behind and to the right of the tabs is "transparent",
exposing the background detail of the parent. The value of Fl::Tabs->box()
does not affect this area. So if Fl::Tabs is resized by itself without the
parent, force the appropriate parent (visible behind the tabs) to redraw() to
prevent artifacts.

See "L<Resizing Caveats|/"Resizing Caveats>" below on how to keep tab heights
constant. See "L<Callback's Use Of when()|/"Callback's Use Of when()">" on how
to control the details of how clicks invoke the callback().

A typical use of the Fl::Tabs widget:

    my $tabs = Fl::Tabs->new(10, 10, 300, 200);
    my $grp1 = Fl::Group->new(20, 30, 280, 170, 'Tab1');
        # Widgets that go in tab #1
        $grp1->end;
    my $grp2 = Fl::Group->new(20, 30, 280, 170, 'Tab2');
        # Widgets that go in tab #2
        $grp21->end;
    $tabs->end;

=head2 Default Appearance

The appearance of each "tab" is taken from the label() and color() of the
child group corresponding to that "tab" and panel. Where the "tabs" appear
depends on the position and size of the child groups that make up the panels
within the Fl_Tab, i.e. whether there is more space above or below them. The
height of the "tabs" depends on how much free space is available.

=head2 Highlighting The Selected Tab

The selected "tab" can be highlighted further by setting the selection_color()
of the Fl::Tab itself, e.g.

    $tabs = Fl::Tabs->new(...);
    $tabs->selection_color(FL_DARK3);

The result of the above looks like:

=head2 Uniform Tab and Panel Appearance

In order to have uniform tab and panel appearance, not only must the color()
and selection_color() for each child group be set, but also the
selection_color() of the Fl::Tab itself any time a new "tab" is selected. This
can be achieved within the Fl::Tab callback, e.g.


    use Fl;

    sub myTabsCallback{
        my ($tabs, $data) = @_;
        # When tab changed, make sure it has same color as its group
        $tabs->selection_color( ($tabs->value())->color() );
    }

    #
    my $w = Fl::Window->new(...);
    # Define tabs widget
    my $tabs = Fl::Tabs->new(...);
    $tabs->callback(\&myTabsCallback);
    # Create three tabs each colored differently
    my $grp1 = Fl::Group->new(..., "One");
        $grp1->color(9);
        $grp1->selection_color(9);
    $grp1->end();
    my $grp2 = Fl::Group->new(..., "Two");
        $grp2->color(10);
        $grp2->selection_color(10);
    $grp2->end();
    my $grp3 = Fl::Group->new(..., "Three");
        $grp3->color(14);
        $grp3->selection_color(14);
    $grp3->end();
    # Make sure default tab has same color as its group
    $tabs->selection_color( ($tab->value())->color() );
    exit Fl::run();

The result of the above looks like:

=head2 Resizing Caveats

When Fl::Tabs is resized vertically, the default behavior scales the tab's
height as well as its children. To keep the tab height constant during
resizing, set the tab widget's resizable() to one of the tab's child groups,
i.e.

    my $tabs = Fl::Tabs->new(...);
    my $grp1 = Fl::Group->new(...);
    # ...
    my $grp2 = Fl::Group->new(...);
    # ...
    $tabs->end();
    $rabs->resizable($grp1); # keeps tab height constant

=head2 Callback's Use Of when()

Fl::Tabs supports the following flags for when():

=over

=item FL_WHEN_NEVER - callback never invoked (all flags off)

=item FL_WHEN_CHANGED - if flag set, invokes callback when a tab has been changed (on click or keyboard navigation)

=item FL_WHEN_NOT_CHANGED - if flag set, invokes callback when the tabs remain unchanged (on click or keyboard navigation)

=item FL_WHEN_RELEASE - if flag set, invokes callback on RELEASE of mouse button or keyboard navigation

=back

Notes:

=over

=item 1. The above flags can be logically OR-ed (|) or added (+) to combine
behaviors.

=item 2. The default value for when() is FL_WHEN_RELEASE (inherited from
Fl::Widget).

=item 3. If FL_WHEN_RELEASE is the only flag specified, the behavior will be
as if (FL_WHEN_RELEASE|FL_WHEN_CHANGED) was specified.

=item 4. The value of changed() will be valid during the callback.

=item 5. If both FL_WHEN_CHANGED and FL_WHEN_NOT_CHANGED are specified, the
callback is invoked whether the tab has been changed or not. The changed()
method can be used to determine the cause.

=item 6. FL_WHEN_NOT_CHANGED can happen if someone clicks on an already
selected tab, or if a keyboard navigation attempt results in no change to the
tabs, such as using the arrow keys while at the left or right end of the tabs.

=back

=head1 Methods

Fl::Tabs inherits from Fl::Group and Fl::Widget. On top of that, it exposes
the following methods...

=head2 new(...)

    my $tab_a = Fl::Tabs->new(0, 0, 250, 500, 'Important Stuff');
    my $tab_b = Fl::Tabs->new(0, 0, 250, 500);

The constructor creates a new widget using the given position, size, and
label.

The default boxtype is FL_THIN_UP_BOX.

Use add($widget) to add each child, which are usually Fl::Group widgets. The
children should be sized to stay away from the top or bottom edge of the
Fl::Tabs widget, which is where the tabs will be drawn.

All children of Fl::Tabs should have the same size and exactly fit on top of
each other. They should only leave space above or below where that tabs will
go, but not on the sides. If the first child of Fl::Tabs is set to
"resizable()", the riders will not resize when the tabs are resized.

The destructor also deletes all the children. This allows a whole tree to be
deleted at once, without having to keep a pointer to all the children in the
user code. A kludge has been done so the Fl::Tabs and all of its children can
be automatic (local) variables, but you must declare the Fl::Tabs widget first
so that it is destroyed last.

The destructor removes the widget.

xs {name        => 'new',
    definitions => [
            {required => [[qw[int x]], [qw[int y]], [qw[int w]], [qw[int h]]],
             optional => [['const char *', 'label', ' 0']],
             returns  => 'Fl_Tabs *'
            }
    ]
};

    definitions => [{required => [[qw[int event]]], returns  => 'int'  }
    ]
};

=head2 client_area()

    my ($rx, $ry, $rw, $rh) = $tabs_a->client_area();
       ($rx, $ry, $rw, $rh) = $tabs_a->client_area( $tabh );

Returns the position and size available to be used by its children.

If there isn't any child yet the tabh parameter will be used to calculate the
return values. This assumes that the children's labelsize is the same as the
Fl::Tabs' labelsize and adds a small border.

If there are already children, the values of child(0) are returned, and $tabh
is ignored.

I<Note>: Children should always use the same positions and sizes.

C<$tabh> can be one of:

=over

=item * 0: calculate label size, tabs on top

=item * -1: calculate lavel size, tabs on bottom

=item * >0: use given C<$tabh> value, tabs on top (height = $tabh)

=item * <-1: use given <$tabh> value, tabs on bottom (height = -$tabh)

=back

=cut

xs {name        => 'client_area',
    definitions => [{optional => [[qw[int tabh 0]]],
                    code => <<'' }]};
            int rx, ry, rw, rh;
            ((Fl_Tabs *)self->cp_ctx)->client_area( rx, ry, rw, rh, tabh );

            PUSHs(sv_newmortal());sv_setiv(ST(1), (int)ry);
            PUSHs(sv_newmortal());sv_setiv(ST(2), (int)rw);
            PUSHs(sv_newmortal());sv_setiv(ST(3), (int)rh);
            XSRETURN(4);

=pod

=head2 push()

    my $group = $tabs_a->push();

Returns the tab group for the tab the user has currently down-clicked on and
remains over until FL_RELEASE.

Otherwise, returns C<undef>.

While the user is down-clicked on a tab, the return value is the tab group for
that tab. But as soon as the user releases, or drags off the tab with the
button still down, the return value will be NULL.

    my $int = $tabs_a->push( $widget );

This would be called by a custom tab widget's handle() method to set the tab
group widget the user last FL_PUSH'ed on.

Set back to zero on FL_RELEASE.

As of this writing, the value is mainly used by draw_tab() to determine
whether or not to draw a 'down' box for the tab when it's clicked, and to turn
it off if the user drags off it.

    {   required => [['Fl_Widget *', 'o']],

        returns => 'int'},
    {returns => 'Fl_Widget *'}]
};

=pod

=head2 value()

    my $tab = $tabs_a->value();

Gets the currently visible widget/tab.

The value() is the first visible child (or the last child if none are visible)
and this also hides any other children. This allows the tabs to be deleted,
moved to other groups, and show()/hide() called without it screwing up.

    my $changed = $tabs_b->value( $widget );

Sets the widget to become the curent visible widget/tab.

Setting the value hides all other children and makes this one visible if it
really is a child.

Returns C<1> if there was a change (new value is different than previous) or
C<0> if there was no change (new value is already set).

    definitions  => [

        returns  => 'int'},
    {returns => 'Fl_Widget *'}]
};

=pod

=head2 which()

    my $widget = $tabs_a->which($event_x, $event_y);

Return the widget of the tab the user clicked on at C<$event_x> / C<$event_y>.

This is used for event handling (clicks) and by fluid to pick tabs.

Returns the child widget of the tab the user clicked on, or C<undef> if there
are no children or if the event is outside of the tabs area.

=cut

xs {name        => 'which',
    definitions => [
    {   required => [[qw[int event_x]], [qw[int event_y]]],
        returns => 'Fl_Widget *'}
    ]
