NAME

    Alt::FFI::Raw::Platypus - Alternate FFI::Raw implementation powered by
    FFI::Platypus

VERSION

    version 0.03

SYNOPSIS

     env PERL_ALT_INSTALL=OVERWRITE cpanm Alt::FFI::Raw::Platypus

DESCRIPTION

    This distribution provides an alternative implementation of FFI::Raw
    that uses FFI::Platypus instead of its own XS code. This may be useful
    in situations that you want to use modules that rely on FFI::Raw on
    platforms that are not supported by the original implementation. This
    approach should allow you to use FFI::Raw code without changing any
    code!

    This implementation uses FFI::Platypus::Legacy::Raw which is a fork of
    the original FFI::Raw that lives in its own namespace. The former is
    useful when you want to migrate to Platypus from Raw to take advantage
    of its type system and ability to attach xsubs, but do not want to
    change all of your code all at once.
