Number::MuPhone

Parse, display and dial phone numbers...

WHY ANOTHER PHONE NUMBER PARSER?

Whilst trying to parse a lot of phone numbers (several million), I found
Number::Phone. On the surface, it looked like a great fit, but it
runs an internal cache that behaves like a memory leak when used
in batch mode to parse large numbers of source phone numbers.

I started digging, and soon realized that I couldn't easily fix
the caching issue without having to rewrite a lot of the underlying
approach. There's a lot of interesting functionality in the module,
but a large chunk of that is not really useful for my main business
case, so I decided to roll out a new module to address my needs
(and hopefully the needs of others, at the same time)
