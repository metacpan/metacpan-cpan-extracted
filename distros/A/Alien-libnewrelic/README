DESCRIPTION

    This distribution provides NewRelic SDK so that it can be used by other
    Perl distributions that are on CPAN. It does this by first trying to
    detect an existing install of NewRelic SDK on your system. If found it
    will use that. If it cannot be found, the source code will be
    downloaded from the internet and it will be installed in a private
    share location for the use of other modules.

SEE ALSO

    NewFangle

      Perl level bindings for this SDK.

    NewRelic::Agent::FFI

      This works with the older (no longer supported) NewRelic Agent SDK

    NewRelic::Agent

      This is an even older XS API around the NewRelic Agent SDK, but
      doesn't link correctly against the NewRelic libraries.
