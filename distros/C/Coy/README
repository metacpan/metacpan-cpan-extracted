DESCRIPTION

	Error messages 
	strewn across my terminal. 
	A vein starts to throb. 

	Their reproof adds the 
	injury of insult to 
	the shame of failure. 

	When a program dies 
	what you need is a moment 
	of serenity. 

	The Coy.pm 
	module brings tranquillity 
	to your debugging. 

	The module alters 
	the behaviour of C<die> and 
	C<warn> (and C<croak> and C<carp>). 

	It also provides 
	C<transcend> and C<enlighten> -- two 
	Zen alternatives. 

	Like Carp.pm, 
	Coy reports errors from the 
	caller's point-of-view. 

	But it prefaces 
	the bad news of failure with 
	a soothing haiku. 

	The haiku are not 
	"canned", but are generated 
	freshly every time. 

	Once the haiku is 
	complete, it's prepended to 
	the error message. 

	Execution of 
	the original call to
	C<die> or C<warn> resumes. 

	Haiku and error
	message strew across my screen. 
	A smile starts to form.
