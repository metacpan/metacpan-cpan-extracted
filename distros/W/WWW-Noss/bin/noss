noss - RSS/Atom feed reader and aggregator

=head1 USAGE

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<noss> is a command-line program for aggregating and reading RSS/Atom feeds.
B<noss> can fetch feed updates, list posts, read posts from the
command-line, open posts in a browser, and much more.

B<noss> works by storing feed and post information in a local database, and the
user interacts with the database by supplying commands to B<noss>.

B<noss> requires a feed list in order for it to function. A feed list is
supplied to B<noss> via a feeds file, a file that contains a list of feeds and
any special configuration to use for those feeds. The format of this file is
documented in the subequent L</"Feeds File"> section of this manual.
Once a list of feeds is supplied to B<noss> through the feeds file, the feeds
can then be fetched and loaded into its database via the C<update> command.

In order for B<noss> to read posts, it must be able to uniquely identify and
distinguish posts from each other.
Posts in B<noss> are identified via two pieces of information: the name of the
feed they're in and their unique ID within that feed. When reading a post,
like with either the C<read> or C<open> command, you would typically supply
the command with the feed name and post ID to refer to that specifc post.

  # Read post #1 in the PlanetDebian feed
  noss read PlanetDebian 1

To determine the feed and ID of a post, the C<list> command can be used to query
the post database for a list of posts that conform to whatever search parameters
are provided (like title containing a string, content matching a regex, being
tagged with a specific tag, etc.). The C<post> command can also be used to query
more detailed post information than the C<list> command provides for a specifc
post. Consult the documentation for the C<list> and C<post> commands in the
L</"COMMANDS"> section of this manual.

So basically, the typical usage of B<noss> would involve managing your feed
list from the feeds file, using the C<update> command to fetch feed updates,
using the C<list> command to see what posts are available, and then using
C<read> or C<open> commands for actually reading posts.

  # Add your feeds
  vim ~/.config/noss/noss.feeds

  # Fetch and update feed updates
  noss update

  # Look to see what posts you have
  noss list
  # ...or only check for unread ones
  noss unread

  # And then actually reading a post
  noss read whatever 12

The L</"COMMANDS"> section of this manual documents the complete list of
commands and any options that are available to them.

B<noss> can also have its behavior modified through a configuration file,
whose format is documented in the L</"CONFIGURATION"> section of this manual.

=head2 Feeds File

As previously mentioned, B<noss> reads its feed list from a feeds file. The
feeds file is a JSON file that contains a list of feeds, feed groups, and
feed configurations for B<noss> to use. B<noss> uses a special JSON format
that supports comments and trailing commas, so that it can be better suited
as a configuration file format. Comments start with a hash (C<#>) sign, are
terminated by the end of a line, and can be placed anywhere where JSON allows
whitespace.

B<noss> will look for a feeds file in the following locations:

=over 4

=item Path specified by the C<-f>|C<--feeds> option

=item F<C<$NOSS_FEEDS>>

=item F<C<$XDG_CONFIG_HOME>/noss/noss.feeds>

=item F<C<$XDG_CONFIG_HOME>/noss.feeds>

=item F<~/.config/noss/noss.feeds>

=item F<~/.config/noss.feeds>

=item F<~/.noss.feeds>

=back

The feeds file can have three different fields: C<feeds>, C<groups>, and
C<default>. The only required field is the C<feeds> field.

=head3 feeds

The C<feeds> field is a key-value map of feed names and their configuration.
Feed names can only contain alphanumeric/underscore characters, and must not be
the name of another feed or group. The feed can either be mapped to a URL string
of the feed it represents or a key-value map of configuration parameters for the
feed. The former has the benefit of better readability but lacks the ability to
have its configuration fine-tuned. The latter can have fine-tuned configuration
but may look more cluttered than the former.

  {
    "feeds": {
      # Just the URL, no specific configuration
      "feed1": "https://phonysite.com/feed1.rss",
      # Key-value map allows for fine-tuned configuration
      "feed2": {
        "feed": "https://phonysite.com/feed2.rss",
        "limit": 100,
        "autoread": false,
      },
    }, # yes, you can have trailing commas :-)
  # yes, you can have comments, too!
  }

When using the latter-style key-value map syntax for a feed, the only required
field is the C<feed> field, which must store the feed's URL. Additional fields,
which are listed below, can be set to provide the previously mentioned
fine-tuned configuration.

=over 4

=item "B<limit>": I<integar>

Specify a limit to the number of posts a feed can contain. If a feed exceeds
the limit, B<noss> will discard older posts to fit into that limit.
By default, there is no limit to the number of posts a feed can contain.

=item "B<respect_skip>": I<bool>

Specify whether to respect the C<skipDays> and C<skipHours> fields in RSS
feeds, which tells feed aggregators to skip updating feeds on certain hours or
days. This is enabled by default, and is recommended to not be disabled.

=item "B<include_title>": "I<target>" | [ "I<target>", ... ]

=item "B<exclude_title>": "I<target>" | [ "I<target>", ... ]

Specify a target string or list of target strings a post title must include or
not include in order to not be filtered out by B<noss> during aggregation.
A I<target> string can either be a literal string that a post title must
include/exclude, or a Perl regex (signified by a leading and trailing
forward slash character) that a title must match/not match.

=item "B<include_content>": "I<target>" | [ "I<target>", ... ]

=item "B<exclude_content>": "I<target>" | [ "I<target>", ... ]

Similar to the C<include_title> and C<exclude_title> parameters, except for
a post's content instead of its title.

=item "B<include_tags>": "I<tag>" | [ "I<tag>", ... ]

=item "B<exclude_tags>": "I<tag>" | [ "I<tag>", ... ]

Specify a tag or list of tags that a post must be tagged with or without in
order to not be filtered out by B<noss> during aggregation.

=item "B<autoread>": I<bool>

Specify whether new posts from this feed should automatically be marked as
C<read> or not. Defaults to C<false>.

=item "B<default_update>": I<bool>

Specify whether this feed should be included in a default update or not
(C<update> when ran with no arguments). Defaults to C<true>.

=item "B<hidden>": I<bool>

Specify whether this feed should be omitted from the C<list> command's default
listing (the list shown when ran with no arguments). Defaults to C<false>.

=back

A feed's specific configuration takes priority over the configuration it may
inherit from the C<default> field or any groups it may be a part of.

B<noss> uses L<curl(1)> for fetching feeds, so generally any URL that is
acceptable for L<curl(1)> will be acceptable for B<noss>. There are two unique
types of URLs that B<noss> will process in a special way.

=over 4

=item file://I</path/to/file>

A URL that starts with the C<file://> protocol will be interpreted as a local
file which B<noss> will copy over to its feed cache and load instead of
fetching remotely via L<curl(1)>.

  # Use the contents of "/home/sam/feeds/feed.rss" as a feed
  "file_feed": "file:///home/sam/feeds/feed.rss"

=item shell://I<command>

A URL that starts with the C<shell://> protocol will be interpreted as a shell
command which B<noss> will execute and capture the output of, then use that
output as the contents of the feed.

  # Use the output of the "cat feed.rss" command as a feed
  "shell_feed": "shell://cat feed.rss"

=back

=head3 groups

C<groups> is a key-value map of group names and their configuration. Feed groups
in B<noss> serve two purposes: 1) to provide a way to logically group
multiple feeds together, and 2) provide a way to "share" a common configuration
between multiple different feeds.

Just like with feeds, group names can only contain alphanumeric/underscore
characters and cannot be the same name as any other group or feed. A group
can either be defined by a list of feed names with no special configuration,
purely acting as a logical collection of feeds, or a key-value map of feed
configuration parameters with a feed list stored in the C<feeds> field of the
map. The same options listed above for a feed's configuration in the C<feeds>
field can be used for a group's configuration.

  {
    "groups": {
      # purely logical feed grouping, no special configuration
      "group1": [ "f1", "f2", "f3" ],
      # each feed will inherit group2's configuration
      "group2": {
        "feeds": [ "f2", "f4", "f6" ],
        "limit": 100,
        "autoread": false,
      },
    },
    "feeds": {
      ...
    },
  }

Feeds are also allowed to be a part of multiple different groups. If a feed
is a part of multiple different groups that try to configure the same parameter,
B<noss> will try to resolve the conflict by picking the most "non-default"
option available. Group configurations take priority over the C<default>
field but are overridden by a feed's own configuration.

=head3 default

The C<default> field is a special feed group that every feed is a part of. Any
configuration in the C<default> feed will used by every feed and group (unless
their configuration overrides the default's). The same configuration options
available to a feed and group are available to C<default>.

  {
    # All feeds have a limit of 100 posts and must contain 'foo' in their
    # titles.
    "default": {
      "limit": 100,
      "include_title": [ "/foo/" ],
    },
    ..
  }

=head1 COMMANDS

=over 4

=item B<update> [I<feed>|I<group>] ...

Fetch and reload feeds. Whenever a new feed is added to B<noss>'s feed list,
this command can be used to load it into B<noss>'s database.

If no specific feeds or groups are specified, all feeds are updated.

See the L</"CAVEATS"> section of this manual for some warnings to keep in mind
when using this command.

C<update> has the following options:

=over 4

=item B<--new-only>

Only update feeds that are not present in the database.

=item B<--non-defaults>

When running C<update> with no arguments, update all feeds, even those that
are configured to not be updated by default.

=item B<--downloads>=I<num>

Specify number of parallel downloads to perform. Default amount is C<10>.

Can also be configured via the C<downloads> configuration field.

=item B<--unconditional>

Unconditionally download feeds, even if they have not been modified since the
last update. This option should be used with caution, as performing
unconditional downloads is wasteful on feed servers and considered bad
practice.

=item B<--limit-rate>=I<speed>

Specify the maximum transfer rate for downloads. Speeds are measured in
bytes/second, unless a suffix is appended. C<k>/C<K>, C<m>/C<M>, and
C<g>/C<G> correspond to kilobytes, megabytes, and gigabytes respectively.

Can also be configured via the C<limit_rate> configuration field.

=item B<--user-agent>=I<agent>

Specify the string to use as the user-agent string.

Can also be configured via the C<user_agent> configuration field.

=item B<--timeout>=I<fractional second>

Specify the maximum number of seconds a transfer is allowed to take.

Can also be configured via the C<timeout> configuration field.

=item B<--proxy>=[I<protocol>://]I<host>[:I<port>]

Specify the proxy server to use. If I<protocol> is not specified, defaults
as a C<http://> proxy. If no port number is specified, defaults to C<1000>.

Can also be configured via the C<proxy> configuration field.

=item B<--proxy-user>=I<user>:I<password>

Specify the username and password to use for proxy authentication.

Can also be configured via the C<proxy_user> configuration field.

=back

=item B<reload> [I<feed>|I<group>] ...

Reload cached feeds. Useful for when you make changes to a feed's configuration
and want B<noss> to recognize the changes. If no feeds are specified, reloads
all cached feeds.

C<reload> has no unique options.

=item B<read> I<feed> [I<post>]

Read the specified post's contents in I<feed> via a pager. If I<post> is not
specified, reads the latest unread post in I<feed>.

C<read> has the following options:

=over 4

=item B<--pager>=I<command>

Use the specified command as the pager for reading the post's contents. Defaults
to L<less(1)> on Unix systems and L<more(1)> on Windows systems.

Can also be configured via the C<PAGER> environment variable and
C<pager> configuration field.

=item B<--no-mark>

Do not mark post as read.

=item B<--stdout>

Instead of reading post via a pager, write the post's formatted contents to
F<stdout>.

=item B<--read-format>=I<fmt>

Specify the format for the post's HTML contents that B<noss> will format when
reading. I<fmt> is a string that consists of formatting codes which will be
substituted by B<noss> for whatever information the code represents. A
formatting code starts with a percentage sign, followed by an optional integar
specifying the pad width, and a character signifying what the code is actually
formatting. If the pad width is negative, the text will be left-justified. See
also the C<read_format> configuration option.

The format string can use the following formatting codes:

=over 2

=item %%

A percentage sign.

=item %f

The name of the feed the post is in.

=item %i

The ID of the post.

=item %t

The title of the post.

=item %u

The URL of the post.

=item %a

The name of the author of the post.

=item %c

The list of categories the post is tagged under.

=item %s

A single character signifying the post's read status (C<r> for read, C<U> for
unread).

=item %S

The post's read status, C<read> or C<unread>.

=item %P

The HTML contents of the post.

=item %C

The date of the post in the preferred date/time representation of the
current locale.

=item %d

The post's day of the month as a decimal number (range 01 to 31).

=item %w

The post's abbreviated day of the week according to the current locale.

=item %W

The post's full day of the week according to the current locale.

=item %m

The post's abbreviated month name according to the current locale.

=item %M

=item %Y

The post's full year.

=item %z

The post's time formatted according to the C<--time-format> option or
C<time_format> configuration field.

=back

=item B<--width>=I<width>

Specify the line width to use for the formatted text output. Defaults to C<80>.
See also the C<line_width> configuration field.

=item B<--html>

Instead of reading the formatted contents of a post, read its unformatted HTML
contents.

=back

=item B<cat> I<feed> [I<post>]

Prints the specified post to F<stdout>. This command is basically just an alias
to C<read --stdout>. If I<post> is not specified, prints the latest unread post.

This command has the same options as the C<read> command.

=item B<open> I<feed> [I<post>]

Open the specified post's link in I<feed> via a web browser. If I<post> is not
specified, opens the latest unread post in I<feed>.

C<open> has the following options:

=over 4

=item B<--browser>=I<command>

Use the specified command as the browser to use for opening the post's URL.
Defaults to L<lynx(1)>.

Can also be configured via the C<BROWSER> environment variable and
C<browser> configuration field.

=item B<--no-mark>

Do not mark post as read.

=back

=item B<list> [I<feed>|I<group>] ...

List posts from specified feeds. When listing posts, B<noss> displays the
post's read status, the name of the feed
the post is a part of, the post's ID, and the title of the post. Each post is
listed on a single line, which should make it easy to process in a pipeline.

If no feeds or groups are specified, all feeds are searched.

C<list> has the following options:

=over 4

=item B<--title>=I<target>

Only list posts containing the string I<target> in their title. If I<target>
starts and ends with a forward slash (C</>), C<list> will interpret it as a
Perl regex and search for posts whose titles match the given regex.

=item B<--tag>=I<tag>

Only list posts tagged with the specified tag. This option can be used
multiple times to specify multiple different tags.

=item B<--status>=I<status>

Only list posts marked with the specified status. Valid values are C<read>
and C<unread>.

=item B<--content>=I<target>

Only list posts containing the string I<target> in their HTML content. If
I<target> starts and ends with a forward slash (C</>), C<list> will interpret
it as a Perl regex and search for posts that match the given regex. This
option can be used multiple times to specify multiple diffrent targets.

=item B<--sort>=I<method>

Sort post list by the given method. The following are valid methods:

=over 2

=item date

Sort posts by date (default).

=item feed

Sort posts by feed.

=item title

Sort posts by title.

=back

This option can also be configured via the C<sort> configuration field.

=item B<--reverse>

Print the post list in reverse order.

=item B<--hidden>

Show hidden feeds when using C<list> with no arguments.

=item B<--list-format>=I<fmt>

Print post information using the specified format. This option works just like
the C<--read-format> option in the C<read> command. Consult its documentation
for how formatting works and list of valid formatting codes.

=back

=item B<unread> [I<feed>|I<group>] ...

Similar to the C<list> command, except only shows unread posts.

This command has the same options as the C<list> command.

=item B<mark> I<status> I<feed>|I<group> [I<post>] ...

=item B<mark> --all I<status>

Mark the given posts in the specified feeds as C<read> or C<unread>.

I<posts> is a list of post IDs to mark as read. If a post argument is a range
(C<I<from>-I<to>>), then each post in that range is marked. I<posts> can only
be specified when marking posts in individual feeds, not when marking groups of
feeds.

This command has the following options:

=over 4

=item B<--all>

Mark all posts in every feed as read or unread.

=back

=item B<post> I<feed> I<post>

View the post information for the specified post.

This command has the following options:

=over 4

=item B<--post-format>=I<fmt>

Specify the format to use for printing post information. Consult the
documentation for the C<read> command's C<--read-format> option for information
on how formatting works and a list of valid formatting codes.

=back

=item B<feeds> [I<feed>|I<group>] ...

View feed information for specified feeds and/or groups. If no feeds are
specified, prints information for all feeds.

This command has the following options:

=over 4

=item B<--brief>

Only print feed names, not additional feed info.

=item B<--feeds-format>=I<fmt>

Specify the format to use for printing feed information. Consult the
documentation for the C<read> command's C<--read-format> option for information
on how format strings are processed.

The following format codes are available:

=over 2

=item %%

A percentage sign.

=item %f

The feed's name.

=item %l

The feed's link.

=item %t

THe feed's title

The feed's description.

=item %a

The feed's author.

=item %c

The feed's tags.

=item %p

The number of posts in the feed.

=item %r

The number of read posts in the feed.

=item %U

The number of unread posts in the feed.

=item %C

=item %d

=item %w

reader. If no output file is specified, the OPML will be written directly to
F<stdout>.

This command has the following options:

=over 4

=item B<--no-groups>

Do not try to generate feed group structures in the exported OPML.

=back

=item B<import> I<opml> [I<json>]

Import feed list from an OPML file. Will write the feed list as a JSON file
which can be used by B<noss>. Writes the feed file to I<json> if specified,
otherwise writes it directly to F<stdout>.

This command has the following options:

=over 4

=item B<--no-groups>

Do no try to import feed groups from the OPML.

=back

=back

=head1 GLOBAL OPTIONS

These options can be used with any command.

=over 4

=item B<-c>|B<--config>=I<file>

Specify path to the B<noss> configuration file.

=item B<-D>|B<--data>=I<dir>

Specify path to the B<noss> data directory. The data directory is the directory
where B<noss> stores data like its feed database and feed cache.

=item B<-f>|B<--feeds>=I<file>

Specify path to the B<noss> feeds file.

=item B<-A>|B<--autoclean>[=I<0>|I<1>]

Toggle whether B<noss> should automatically run the C<clean> command after any
operation. C<0> disables autoclean, C<1> enables it. Giving no argument is the
equivalent to enabling autoclean. This command helps with automatically freeing
up unused space at the cost of a slight performance penalty.
By default, autoclean is disabled. This
option can also be configured via the C<autoclean> configuration field.

=item B<-z>|B<--time-format>=I<fmt>

Specify the time format to use for the C<%z> formatting code. L<strftime(3)> is
used to perform the time formatting, so consult its manual for writing a
format string. See also the C<time_format> configuration field.

If this option is not set, C<%z> will default to the C<%c> L<strftime(3)>
formatting code.

=item B<-h>|B<--help>

Print B<noss>'s usage message and exit.

=item B<-v>|B<--version>

Print B<noss>'s version and copyright info, then exit.

=back

=head1 CONFIGURATION

B<noss> can have its behavior configured by writing it a configuration file.
A B<noss> configuration file is a JSON file that supports the same extensions
as the feeds file (comments and trailing commas).

B<noss> will look for a configuration file in the following locations:

=over 4

=item Path specifed by the C<-c>|C<--config> option

=item F<C<$NOSS_CONFIG>>

=item F<C<$XDG_CONFIG_HOME>/noss/noss.conf>

For Unix-like systems, B<noss> also comes with a script called L<nossui(1)>,
which is a L<dialog(1)>-based frontend that provides a terminal user
interface for B<noss>. Not all of the functionality of B<noss> is available
through L<nossui(1)>, so it shouldn't be used as a complete replacement for
B<noss>, but it should be suitable for most of B<noss>'s routine usage.

=head1 CAVEATS

Updating a feed too frequently can be wasteful on a server's resources, and in
extreme cases could result in them banning you from accessing their feed. The
acceptable frequency of feed updates varies from server to server, but a good
rule of thumb is once per hour at most. You should also refrain from using
the C<--unconditional> option without a good reason.
