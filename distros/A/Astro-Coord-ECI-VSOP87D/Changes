    Eliminate prototyped testing routines.

    Test quadmath the same as longdouble. Thanks to Chris Williams
    (BINGOS) for finding this.

    Remove -model option from tools/reference since we only implement
    'D'.

    Adjust test limit for 'long double' Perls. I believe that the
    problem is that the reference data were generated by a Fortran
    program using double precision rather than long double, so we're
    really dealing with a difference in rounding/truncation error. This
    really only affects Mercury, the problem child of the Solar System.
    Thanks to Slaven Rezić (SREZIC) for testing this configuration and
    exposing the issue.

    Fix broken POD links and add test to ensure they stay fixed.
