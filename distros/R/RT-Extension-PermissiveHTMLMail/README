NAME
    RT-Extension-PermissiveHTMLMail - Allows a greater range of HTML in RT,
    at the cost of security

RT VERSION
    Works with RT 4.0 and RT 4.2.

SUMMARY
    By default, RT displays HTML mail; however, due to security concerns, by
    default it does not allow the full range of HTML to be used.
    Specifically, it prevents:

    Tables
        Because RT cannot ensure that HTML in email is balanced, malicious
        email messages can use tables to mimic or mask parts of the standard
        RT UI. This opens RT to a broad range of "phishing attacks," wherein
        the user believes they are clicking a benign RT link, which actually
        is controlled by the originator of the email. This can allow
        attackers to steal passwords and compromise RT, and possibly other
        servers.

    Many text styles
        CSS is a powerful tool; it can also be used to mimic or mask parts
        of the standard RT UI. By default, RT thus only allows a small
        subset of CSS properties, which are sufficient for simple styling.
        Allowing arbitrary styles could lead to effective "phishing
        attacks," compromising passwords.

    Installing this extension loosens the above restrictions; this should be
    sufficient for most needs. However, RT will still only allow HTML tags
    that it recognizes.

    Installing this extension also additionally provides a
    $AllowDangerousHTML configuration option. Setting this alters RT from
    using a whitelist (allowing only HTML tags and attributes which it knows
    to be safe) to using a blacklist (skip tags and attributes which are
    unsafe). This is unsafe and dangerous, as there are guaranteedly further
    unsafe tags which RT does not know to prevent. Enabling this feature
    allows your RT account to be compromised by a malicious email. Do not
    enable it (via Set( $AllowDangerousHTML, 1 )) unless you understand the
    consequences.

INSTALLATION
    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make install
        May need root permissions

    Edit your /opt/rt4/etc/RT_SiteConfig.pm
        If you are using RT 4.2 or greater, add this line:

            Plugin('RT::Extension::PermissiveHTMLMail');

        For RT 4.0, add this line:

            Set(@Plugins, qw(RT::Extension::PermissiveHTMLMail));

        or add RT::Extension::PermissiveHTMLMail to your existing @Plugins
        line.

    Clear your mason cache
            rm -rf /opt/rt4/var/mason_data/obj

    Restart your webserver
