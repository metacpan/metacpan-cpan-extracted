Revision history for Perl extension Tk::JComboBox.

1.14 Maintenance/Bug Fixes: (No new features)

   - Issue: bdz (on clptk) reported a problem when choices 
     arrayref contained a selected param for one of the 
     entries (in editable mode). The problem was due to 
     choices method being called prior to the widget 
     options being defined in ConfigSpecs within the 
     Populate method.

     - Resolution: Moved choices call to after the 
        ConfigSpecs definition; tested. Seems fine.

   - Issue: Benoît Vincente reported obscure problem that
     indicated problems with JComboBox::Tie. After 
     investigation, it appears that when the master
     JComboBox is destroyed, it is not automatically
     removed the tie. This problem is trickier than 
     it appears, partly because of the implementation
     of Tk::JComboBox::Tie and partly because of how
     widget destruction is done in Perl/Tk. 

     - Resolution: Added a few lines to check all 
     JComboBox listeners, to see if they still existed prior
     to sending event notification to each. If a listener
     no longer exists, it is removed, and the reference 
     is undef'd. This appears to fix the case Benoît 
     reported (which should rarely occur in any case).

   - Minor revisions to JComboBox pod.
   
1.13 Maintenance/Bug Fixes:

  There are no new features in this release. It contains some
minor changes to documentation, and test code. In addition it
contains one a fix for memory leaks due to the 8.4 version of
Listbox.

   - Issue: JComboBox has exhibted memory leaks due to its use
     of Tk::Listbox since the 804 (Tk8.4) release.

     -- Any megawidget or application that uses Listbox 
        potentially has this issue, unless a workaround is 
        used. The workaround regards the new -listvariable
        option and is less than intuitive, since as the docs
        for Listbox state, -listvariable is not completely
        implemented. Suffice to say, there are gotchas. The
        real solution is to patch the C code so that it no
        longer leaks. The fix I have in place will do for now.
        Thanks to Zentara for his posts on c.l.p.tk and 
        Perlmonks that got me headed in the right direction.
   
   - Issue: The new test for Pod has a minor typo, that will
     result in a test failure instead of a skipped tests for
     those system that do not have Test::Pod installed. This
     problem was reported by bdz on c.l.p.tk. 5 Oct 06.

     -- Resolution: Fixed typo.

   - Issue: JComboBox docs need updating for binding/event
     handling. Also pointed out by bdz on c.l.p.tk.

     -- Resolution: Revised docs and example.

   - Misc: Removed a few tabs from code, along with Line feeds,
     that have found their way in again.

1.12 Maintenance/Bug Fixes:

This is a maintenance release of Tk-JComboBox that addresses an 
issue with the -popupcreate callback option. In addition, I've
updated some test cases, added an examples directory, and updated
some of the Pod files. There is a potential backward compatibility
issue with this release (the -popupcreate option), but there is no
major new functionality (At least one new option may be coming in
the next release...)
 
   - Issue: jdtoronto posted a bug report on the Perlmonks site.
     http://perlmonks.org/?node_id=573624. He was attempting to 
     use the popupcreate option to modify the JComboBox each time
     the Popup was triggered. In version 1.11 and for at least the
     past few versions, registering a callback to this option 
     meant that you were assuming responsibility for configuring
     the height/width and positioning of the JCombobox, which can
     be a pain. 

     -- Resolution: I decided that this was too big a pain to pass on
     to users, and modified the option so that the physical 
     configuration occurs outside of this callback. -popupmodify
     can still be used to override the layout properties if needed.
     The result is that popupcreate is simpler to implement (it was
     mostly provided as a means to alter the list item contents of
     the JComboBox). Documentation, and test cases were adjusted 
     accordingly, plus an example was provided in the new examples
     directory that demonstrates the option in action.

   - After conversation with Fred Jan, I reconsidered the implementation
     of the -textvariable option. JComboBox goes a bit further than some
     other widgets and heavily controls -textvariable use. I've decided
     to leave it as is for now, but to hold onto the correspondance and
     possibly revisit it in the future. No changes aside from a tweak
     to the docs.

   - Took another pass through the JComboBox docs to update several links
     that were incorrect, and fix some wording here and there.

1.11 Bug Fixes:

   - Bug: incorrect behavior when state is disabled twice in a row.
     reported via rt[at]cpan.org (#19154) by: Neal

     Description: When JComboBox state is disabled, in addition to
      freezing the controls, the foreground colors are replaced to 
      provide a visual clue that the widget was disabled, which 
      is inline with other Tk widget behavior. Unfortunately, due to
      a bug in the DisableControls method, setting the state to 
      disabled twice in a row, resulted in the foreground color not
      getting restored correctly.
     
     Resolution: Neal provided a patch to the faulty method, which 
      corrected the problem and doesn't appear to introduct any 
      side-effects that I could observe during testing. Patch gratefully
      accepted, and applied to code.      

   - Questionable behavior: hard-coded color (white) for popup listbox bg
     reported via rt[at]cpan.org (#18357) by: ozcat[at]bigpond.net.au
     - resolution: removed hard-code color.

     Notes: I vaguely have some recollection of changing this to be white
     because I wanted to ensure default behavior, but in retrospect, 
     this was a big mistake, and meant that default user/env  preferences 
     would be ignored. Glad someone called me on it...

   - Bug: Forgotten debug line left in code. 
     reported via rt[at]cpan.org (#17785)  by: northwind_1980 
     - resolution: removed line.

   - Bug: Invalid behavior related to grab (again... aaarrgh!)
     reported via newsgroup and email by Lars Oeschey

     Description: 
       Lars sent sample code that featured two JComboBox instances, one 
       defined a -selectcommand callback which called setSelectedIndex(0), 
       and then showPopup in the other instance. The result: grab settings
       were messed up.

     Problem: the problem was in the ButtonRelease event handler. In it,
      I called setSelectedIndext (which in turn triggers the selectcommand
      callback), before calling hidePopup. Big mistake. This appears to be
      the only place left in the code where they are ordered this way. 
      hidePopup should always be called before triggering the selectcommand
      callback, otherwise it's very easy to get the current grab mixed up,
      before hidePopup has had a chance to clear it correctly.
 
     Resolution: reversed ordering of the two lines in ButtonRelease, and 
      the test code appears to work correctly.

   - Documentation updates: Looking over the docs in AnnoCPAN I noticed that
     some of the Subwidgets were mislabled. This has been corrected.

1.10 Bug Fix: corrected -textvariable problems.

   - Bug reported via c.l.p.tk [Tk::JComboBox Question - 
     http://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.perl.tk/msg/2971450102b53533
     textvariable option not working correctly: when set, a default value
     *does* appear in the JCombobox Entry, however once the Button is 
     pressed, it does not appear selected (or scrolled to) within the 
     Listbox. This occcurs when the Button is pushed once. If pressed again
     the item does show as selected.

     The problem: Because I wasn't a big fan of the option, I implemented
     it in an overly simplistic way, by delegating it to the Entry widget.
     This meant that it if the variable was assigned a value, then it would
     appear within the Entry widget, but the rest of the JComboBox code
     would not necessarily be aware of it. There was code that was "set"
     the value as selected when the Popup Listbox was closed, but not 
     when it was triggered.

     The solution: I tried two different solutions, the one I decided to 
     go with was what I probably should have done orginally which was tie
     the textvariable to JComboBox code, so that stores/fetches were tied
     to JComboBox methods, and there was some measure of consistancy in the
     implementation. For example, before if the JComboBox was in readonly
     mode, you could use -textvariable to set a value that didn't appear
     within the Listbox, which broke the basic model of the mode. I used
     Steve Lidie's Tie::Watch class to implement the fix.

   - Docs and Test cases were updated to reflect the modifications, and I 
     did some more proofreading on JComboBox.pod to remove typos and a few
     inaccuracies. 

1.09 Bug Fix

   - Bug reported and fixed in version 1.06 (cpan#12372) reopened in
     report (cpan#14520) from tjtoocool@phreaker.net - there were 
     still some lingering issues with DialogBox widgets interfering
     with this widget, Including two specific cases where hidePopup 
     tried to reinstate grab to a destroyed widget and another case 
     where hidePopup would try to assign grab to a
     widget that was iconified. 

1.08 Bug Fixes + new Features

   - Fonts still an issue for 1.07 tests; commented out tests while I 
     rethink testing scheme.
   
   - Jack Dunnigan requested that the choices array be made to support
     multiple JComboBox instances; I've put in an initial implementation
     but I susppect that it will be refactored in the future with a 
     better solution. Updated docs to reflect change.

     -- I'm still considering a more generic solution, like the ListModel
     in the java swing api. Something that could be reused easily for 
     the various Tk widgets that use internal Lists.

1.07 Bug Fixes + new Features

   - Ken Prows reported test failure to CPAN bug tracker #12788
     The failure was due to a font within a test not being available
     on a test platform. 

     - I've fixed this, hopefully this will fix test failures.
   
   - Jack Dunnigan reported a bug related to -state option: 
     when state is disabled, then reset to normal some of the colors
     don't switch back as they should.
 
     - This has been fixed. Jack also noted that there is a lot of
     code that seems to be unnecessary for disabled bg/fg. I agreed,
     but this code is in place to make it backward-compatible for
     those who have not upgraded to Tk804.* releases. Eventually, I see
     some of this code fading away, but for now, it remains. There 
     still seem to be issues with Tk804.* so some may not have upgraded.

   - Jack Dunnigan requested the ability to tie internal state of 
     JCombobox items to the array reference passed to the -choices 
     option. 

     - I added this new feature, and added tests, and new docs
     in JComboBox reference and tutorial pod.
 
     Notes: I hadn't thought of doing this before, and it was 
     intriguing. It is similar in principle to how Java's swing 
     components implement MVC. Jack suggesed Tk::Trace, however I
     preferred Steve Lidie's Tie::Watch module. After implementing
     most of the functionality, I discovered that Tie::Watch didn't
     support DELETE and EXISTS (which I've come to discover have
     limited usefulness when applied to arrays...). I notified Steve,
     and switched to use Tie::Array instead. I plan to switch back
     to Tie::Watch the next time there is a Tk release that includes
     Steve's updated module. 

   - Jack Dunnigan requested a way to alter how autofind anchors
     its search string when determine whether or not a field matches.

     - Implemented this with a new callback option called -matchcommand
     This will allow someone to supply their own callback to determine
     if an item matches or not.

     Notes: I originally considering implementing this as another 
     autofind option called -searchanchor, but ultimately decided against 
     it, when James White commented that the option could be made even 
     more flexible by passing a reference to a regular expression. I 
     think that the callback approach should deliver a decent option
     that delivers sufficient flexibility to plug in whichever approach
     is required. I believe this option will rarely be used in any case,
     because I question whether the resulting behavior is user friendly.
     I'm not sure if JComboBox is the best fit for Jack's intended 
     purpose.

1.06 Bug Fix for JComboBox, fixes to Test Code

   - Ken Prows reported bug to CPAN Bug Tracker #12372
     JComboBox was interfering with grab. Ken suggested
     a solution, which I added. 

     - Added a test to 06_Bugs.t to test the new code.
     - Updated docs to add some mention of grab issues.

   - Testers reported several issues with test cases, and 
     I think I have worked at least some of these out.

     - Found spots where I wasn't destroying a JCombobox
       between test cases which fouled up a few tests. Fixed it.
   
     - Used carp to print labels for tests, so that I can track
       problems more efficiently. My own tests work fine on WinXP
       and Fedora 2 (using Gnome & KDE).

     - Removed line feeds from tests.

1.05 Updated Test Code - No changes to any of the Modules!
    
   - Failed Test Report:
     http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.cpan.testers/188280
     By cpan@www.interlab.nl
  
     Reported that I'd Forgotten PREREQ_PM - (how embarrassing)
       - Modfied Makefile.PL accordingly.  
     
   - Failed Test Report:
     http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.cpan.testers/188015
     by: saper@cpan.org

     I hope Sébastien doesn't give up on me and stop testing this
     module. I expected it would fail, since I wasn't entirely
     certain what had failed. Unfortunately, this error report
     was tougher to get anything out of than the last one, and the
     fault lies solely with me, since my scripts were apparently 
     so brittle that a few of them died before running even ONE
     test!

     - Modified test scripts making extensive use of eval blocks
     so that problems with one test would kill the entire script.
     Hopefully, the carp calls I've added will give me more helpful
     information on what's going wrong, so that I can fix it. 

1.04 Bug Fix - Response to Failed test report
     http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.cpan.testers/187588
     By: Sébastien Aperghis-Tramoni <saper@cpan.org>
 
   - Some options were not being set to an initial value, and 
     were passing undef or "" off as a color. NOTE: this did
     not trigger an error on Win32.
     - Set default values for -highlightbackground, -highlightcolor,
       and -disabledbackground.

   - Noticed that some tests were using methods that expected 
     JComboBox to be packed (TestListwidth). Adjusted setup
     method TestListwidth and TestHighlight to test packed
     widgets, and made sure that update was called immediately
     after pack call. Mods in 02_Basic_Options.t, 
     03_Options_Callback. NOTE: the problem did not trigger
     any errors on Win32.

   - Cleaned code in various Test files, and JComboBox.pm
     - Ensure that I was using single quotes for all uses
       of cget and hash keys. This was done for consistancy
       and possibly older versions of perl.

1.03 Bug Fix - Bug Submitted by Ken Prows - 01 Mar 05

   - Bug (cpan#11707) Fixed: AutoFind was not using listbox->see
     to ensure that an entry in the listbox would be visible
     when it was selected through AutoFind.
     - Added 16 Tests in Test suite to test for bug (06_Bugs.t)
     - Fixed AutoFind sub in JComboBox.pm

   - Updated Construct Call so that JComboBox can only be created
     by a Frame-based widget.
     
1.02 Repaired Broken Test file: accidentally left a MainLoop call in test.
     No code changed. Versions: 1.01, 0.01, 0.02 removed from CPAN.

1.01 Bug Fix and Refactorings

   - Tutorial images were excluded from distribution. Added:
      lib/Tk/JComboBox/jcb_edit.gif
      lib/Tk/JComboBox/jcb_ro.gif

   - Updated -listwidth:
     - Fixed the -listwidth option to work correctly in JComboBox.pm
       the default value and conditions within the code were incorrect
     - Updated JComboBox.pod to include default value for -listwidth
     - added unit tests for -listwidth in 02_Options_Basic.t

   - Replaced majority of "constants" using new CreateGetSet 
     method to create a cleaner way of setting/accessing hashref keys
     The constants were not working as desired.

   - Corrected typos in tutorial.pod based on feedback from 
     Zentara <zentara@highstream.net>

   - Updated -entrybackground:
     - Changed reference to -textbackground option to -entrybackground
       in tutorial.pod
     - corrected -entrybackground configuration in JComboBox::ConfigSpecs.
     - updated description in JComboBox.pod.
     - added unit tests in 02_Options_Basic.t

   - Updated -state option: when set to 'disabled' keyboard traversal using
     Tab was not working correctly. JComboBox should have been skipped.
     - fixed the problem, and added unit test for option in 04+Options_Misc.t

   - Dumbed down test slightly in 04_Options_Misc.t because of problems
     with Tk in Windows 2000. Was unable to correctly generate events for
     <Up> and <Down>. The unit tests were throwing false errors because
     of Tk problems and not JComboBox code. Modified test to call event
     handler directly instead of simulating <Up> or <Down> events.

1.00 Major release with many changes and new features.

   - HTML docs converted to POD format

   - Extensive test suite added

   - Updated -mode option: Now can only be set once, at construction time.
     - documentation updated to reflect this change.

   - Added -autofind option to decouple validation from a find keyboard-based
     find capability. (see docs).

   - Updated subwidget names (kept old ones for backward compatibility).
