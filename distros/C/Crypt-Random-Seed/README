Crypt::Random::Seed version 0.03
========================

Crypt::Random::Seed provides a simple interface to get the strongest source
of randomness on the current platform, typically for use in seeding a CSPRNG
such as Math::Random::ISAAC.  It can also be restricted to non-blocking
sources, and has a very simple plug-in method.

The following sources are tried, in order:
  Win32 Crypto API
  EGD
  /dev/random
  Crypt::Random::TESHA2


INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install


DEPENDENCIES

Win32::API on Windows.

Crypt::Random::TESHA2, only used if /dev/random or Win32 API doesn't work.


SEE ALSO

Crypt::URandom provides similar functionality for non-blocking sources.

For more complex setups, Crypt::Random::Source has multiple plugins.
