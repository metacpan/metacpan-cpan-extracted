        ...

SUBROUTINES/METHODS
  last()
    Fetches the last quotes. Can accept a hashref that indicates the
    formatting:

        # returns an array of WWW::FMyLife::Item objects
        $fml->last();

        # or more explicitly
        $fml->last( { as => 'object' } ); # same as above
        $fml->last( { as => 'text'   } ); # returns an array of text anecdotes
        $fml->last( { as => 'data'   } ); # returns an array of hashes of anecdotes

    You can also specify which page you want:

        # return 1st page
        my @last = fml->last();

        # return 5th page
        my @last = $fml->last(5);

        # same
        my @last = $fml->last( { page => 5 } );

    And options can be mixed:

        my @not_so_last = $fml->last( { as => 'text', page => 50 } );
