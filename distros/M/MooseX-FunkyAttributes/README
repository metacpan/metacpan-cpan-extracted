    MooseX::FunkyAttributes - add code smell to your Moose attributes

SYNOPSIS
       package Circle;
   
       use Moose;
       use MooseX::FunkyAttributes;
   
       has radius => (
          is          => 'rw',
          isa         => 'Num',
          predicate   => 'has_radius',
       );
   
       has diameter => (
          traits      => [ FunkyAttribute ],
          is          => 'rw',
          isa         => 'Num',
          custom_get  => sub { 2 * $_->radius },
          custom_set  => sub { $_->radius( $_[-1] / 2 ) },
          custom_has  => sub { $_->has_radius },
       );

DESCRIPTION
    The MooseX::FunkyAttributes module itself just provides some convenience
    functions for the attribute traits that are distributed with it.

    The grand uniting idea behind the traits is that although Moose generally
    uses blessed hashrefs for object internals, storing each attribute as an
    entry in the hash, sometimes you may want to change that behaviour for
    individual attributes. For example, you could use the inside-out technique
    for one attribute to suppress it from appearing in Data::Dumper dumps.

    The traits bundled with MooseX::FunkyAttributes are as follows. Please see
    the documentation for each individual trait for further details.

    *   MooseX::FunkyAttributes::Role::Attribute

        Allows you to override the get, set, clear and predicate operations
        for an attribute. These are just the raw operations you're overriding;
        you do not need to implement type constraint checking, coercians,
        checking required attributes, defaults, builders, etc.

        With this trait you can create attributes which are calculated on the
        fly (as in the SYNOPSIS) or stored somewhere outside the object's
        blessed hashref.

    *   MooseX::FunkyAttributes::Role::Attribute::InsideOut

        This trait stores the attribute using the inside-out technique. If you
        want your whole object to be inside-out, then use MooseX::InsideOut.

    *   MooseX::FunkyAttributes::Role::Attribute::Delegated

        This trait delegates the storage of one attribute to another
        attribute. For example:

           package Head;
           use Moose;
           has mouth => (
              is           => 'ro',
              isa          => 'Mouth',
           );
   
           package Person;
           use Moose;
           use MooseX::FunkyAttributes;
           has head => (
              is           => 'ro',
              isa          => 'Head',
           );
           has mouth => (
              is           => 'ro',
              isa          => 'Mouth::Human',
              traits       => [ DelegatedAttribute ],
              delegated_to => 'head',
           );

        It is not dissimilar to the Moose's idea of "handles" (in the example
        above, we could have not defined a `mouth` attribute as part of the
        `Person` class, and just specified that `head` handles `mouth`)
        however because `mouth` is now a proper attribute in the Person class
        (and will show up via Moose's introspection API), it can have its own
        type constraints, coercion, trigger, predicate, etc.

    The MooseX::FunkyAttributes module itself exports some constants (e.g.
    `FunkyAttribute` in the SYNOPSIS) which can be used as abbreviations for
    the full trait package names. These constants are:

    `FunkyAttribute`
    `InsideOutAttribute`
    `DelegatedAttribute`

SEE ALSO
    MooseX::FunkyAttributes::Role::Attribute,
    MooseX::FunkyAttributes::Role::Attribute::InsideOut,
    MooseX::FunkyAttributes::Role::Attribute::Delegated.

    These effect storage for whole object instances; not just one attribute:
    MooseX::GlobRef, MooseX::InsideOut, MooseX::ArrayRef.

    MooseX::CustomInitArgs - if you have (as in the SYNOPSIS) one attribute
    which is calculated from another (diameter from radius),
    MooseX::CustomInitArgs will allow you to accept both attributes in the
    constructor (i.e. accept a diameter in the constructor, halve it, and set
    the radius attribute).
