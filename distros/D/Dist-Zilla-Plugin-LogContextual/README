NAME
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::LogContextual - Set up Log::Contextual for use with
    Dist::Zilla

VERSION
    version 0.001000

DESCRIPTION
    "Log::Contextual" is a context driven Logging facility that aims to
    provide cross-cutting log mechanisms.

    However, the way it works means that if nobody starts an initial
    "set_logger" call, the logs may go nowhere. Or something.

    I don't really understand it all fully, so I'm implementing what I know
    to learn it better.

TL;DR
    One day "dzil" may do this out of the box [citation needed]

    However, otherwise, if you have any plugins or tools or whatnot that
    want to use "Log::Contextual", you'll need to load this "plugin" first.

        [LogContextual]
        ; plugins with Log::Contextual in them should work nao

TIPS ON USING Log::Contextual
    Using "Log::Contextual" with "Dist::Zilla" is not entirely painless.

    Notably, because the role "Dist::Zilla::Role::Plugin" exports a few
    logging methods with the same name as "Log::Contextual".

    This has the unfortunate side effect of meaning the following wont work:

        use Moose;
        use Log::Contextual::LogDispatchouli  qw( log_debug );
        with 'Dist::Zilla::Role::Plugin';

        sub foo {
            log_debug {  }; # messes up and tries to call the log_debug method provided by $self->logger
        }

    There's an easy way around this, but it doesn't seem obvious at first
    glance.

        use Moose;
        use Log::Contextual::LogDispatchouli qw( log_debug );
        use namespace::autoclean;
        with 'Dist::Zilla::Role::Plugin';

        sub foo {
            log_debug {  }; # Now works
        }

    If you're confused, that is quite o.k.

    But its sensible once you understand how.

    Essentially, because the "log_debug" "sub" is removed at compile time,
    all calls to that become fixed, instead of flexible.

    So here's how "perl" processes the above code:

        # COMPILE PHASE
        use Moose;
        use Log::Contextual::LogDispatchouli qw( log_debug );
        use namespace::autoclean;

        sub foo {
            log_debug {  }; # BINDS this call to the imported sub
        }

        # END OF COMPILE PHASE
        # namespace::autoclean removes *log_debug forcing the bind
        # RUNTIME
        with  'Dist::Zilla::Role::Plugin'; # Cant change compile-time things.

    Its not 100% ideal, but it works!.

CAVEATS
    *   NO PREFIXES

        At this time, The nice pretty "[Foo/Bar]" prefix from
        "$plugin->plugin_name" is not supported.

        We're not sure if it ever will, it probably will, but the code makes
        my head hurt at present.

        Was better to release something, albeit feature incomplete, than to
        release nothing at all.

    *   REQUIRES "::LogDispatchouli" subclass

        This seems in contrast to the Log::Contextual design principles,
        things invoking loggers shouldn't care about how they're working,
        just they should work.

        I'm *Hoping* in a future release of "::LogDispatchouli" that it can
        transparently do the right thing when calling code simply does

            use Log::Contextual

        So the "Dispatchouli" is *strictly* top level knowledge.

        But I'll wait for updates on how that should work before I make it
        work that way =)
