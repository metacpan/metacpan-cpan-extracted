Revision history for SVN-Hooks. -*- text -*-

1.36      2022-09-09 22:02:37-03:00 America/Sao_Paulo

  [Fix]

  - Fix the SVN::Hooks::DenyChanges test to work on case-insensitive
    filesystems.

1.35      2022-09-03 22:00:58-03:00 America/Sao_Paulo

  [Fix]

  - Fix a filetest check on SVN::Hooks::UpdateConfFile.

1.34      2016-11-10 14:16:13-02:00 America/Sao_Paulo

  [Fix]

  - Remove tests for SVN::Hooks::JiraAcceptance that should have been
    removed on 1.33.

1.33      2016-10-31 13:41:42-02:00 America/Sao_Paulo

  [Changes]

  - The SVN::Hooks::CheckJira plugin now uses the JIRA::REST module instead
    of the JIRA::Client module to talk to JIRA. The JIRA::Client module uses
    the SOAP API which was deprecated in JIRA 6 and isn't supported anymore
    by JIRA 7. Note that this may break hooks that use one of the check-*
    options to the CHECK_JIRA directive, because they now pass a JIRA::REST
    object to the user functions instead of a JIRA::Client object.

  - The SVN::Hooks::JiraAcceptance plugin was removed from the distribution
    because it depended directly on the JIRA::Client module.

1.32      2016-07-19 14:05:37-03:00 America/Sao_Paulo

  [Changes]

  - Now hooks can assume they run with their current directory set to the
    repository's roor directory on the server. Previously they could not
    assume anything, since Subversion does not specify where the hooks run.

1.31      2015-11-26 23:13:57-02:00 America/Sao_Paulo

  [Fixes]

  - Fix bug introduced in version 1.26 that made hooks be invoked as many
    times as their plugin directives was used. For example, if the
    CHECK_JIRA directive was used 10 times to configure the CheckJira
    plugin, the pre-commit function hook was invoked 10 times too! Hooks
    that just checked conditions were made slower by this bug, but hooks
    that performed actions (such as sending notifications) would execute
    them multiple times, with probably bad effects.

1.30      2015-08-29 13:19:57-03:00 America/Sao_Paulo

  [Fixes]

  - Make sure tests are performed using the C locale.

1.29      2015-08-24 08:20:10-03:00 America/Sao_Paulo

  [Fixes]

  - Andrey Starodubtsev contributed fixes to make tests pass on Windows.

  - Subversion 1.9.0 seems to have a bug on the pre-lock/pre-unlock hooks
    that makes the commands lock/unlock succeed even if the hooks fail. This
    release skips tests using those hooks when using svn 1.9.

1.28      2015-02-18 09:33:41-02:00 America/Sao_Paulo

  [Internal changes]

  - Clean up module prerequisite list in dist.ini.
    
  - Use Dist::Zilla::Plugin::MetaProvide to insert provides into META.yml.
    
  - Replace README with brian d foy's README.pod template.
    
  - Update documentation.

1.27      2014-08-09 17:04:45 America/Sao_Paulo

  [Fixes]

  - UpdateConfFile: Fix detection of paths outside of the repository's conf
    directori when specified as a TO argument to the UPDATE_CONF_FILE
    directive.

  - CheckJira: Fix default value for CHECK_JIRA_CONFIG 4th argument.

1.26      2014-07-04 10:48:58 America/Sao_Paulo

  [Changes]

  - Add directive CHECK_JIRA_DISABLE to SVN::Hooks::CheckJira to disable all
    CHECK_JIRA directives.

  - Make hooks execute in the order they are defined. Previously, the
    execution order was unspecified. (Change kindly contributed by
    DC. Thanks!)

1.25      2014-04-13 16:50:07 America/Sao_Paulo

  [Fixes]

  - UpdateConfFile: the specification of a subdirectory as the
    destination file wasn't working.

1.24      2014-03-16 23:31:06 America/Sao_Paulo

  [Fixes]

  - CheckMimeTypes: disregard symbolic links because they don't need to
    have the svn:mime-type property set.

  - UpdateConfFile: create non-existing directories if the 'to'
    specification contains directories they are created if they don't
    exist.

1.23      2013-11-22 08:13:25 America/Sao_Paulo

  [Fixes]

  - Some tests were failing when run with Subversion 1.8 because
    of changes in the 'svn propset' command.

1.22      2013-11-19 11:19:06 America/Sao_Paulo

  [Changes]

  CheckJira: accept and disregard spaces in the "projects"
  specification.

  [Fixes]

  The META.yml information which is automatically generated from
  Github had a wrong URL for the module repository.

1.21      2013-06-18 09:36:02 America/Sao_Paulo

  UpdateConfFile implements a new option 'remove' which, when
  set, makes the configuration file in the server be removed if
  the its versioned counterpart is removed from the repository.

1.20      2013-06-12 15:08:11 America/Sao_Paulo

  In CheckJira, the PROJKEYS in a 'projects' option may now have
  spaces around the comma separating project keys.

  Fix UpdateConfFile. It was considering only the fist
  added/updated file in a commit for updating.

  Fix CheckStructure numeric else-clause detection. Also, fix
  its documentation to say that negative values are also treated
  as true. Only zeroes are considered false. (Thanks to Uwe
  Satthoff for bringing this to my attention!)

1.19      2012-06-24 15:12:56 America/Sao_Paulo

  that merges are performed only on allowed places.

1.13      2012-03-05 11:49:34 America/Sao_Paulo

  Fix RT#75547 by making Windows test scripts non-verbose.
