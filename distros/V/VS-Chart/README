NAME
    VS::Chart - Simple module to create beautifully looking charts

SYNOPSIS
     use VS::Chart;

     my $chart = VS::Chart->new;

     .. Add data to $chart here ...
     $chart->add(@row);

     $chart->render( type => "line", as => "png", to => "my_chart.png" );

PHILOSOPHY
    *   Simple interface

    *   Defaults should look great

    *   DWIW

    *   Extendable implementation

DESCRIPTION
    This module produces charts from data. Such charts might be line, pie
    and boxes. Currently only linecharts are implemented. The renderer uses
    Cairo Graphics (<http://www.cairographics/>), a graphics library for
    creating vector graphics, to produce crisp and correct output. Currently
    we limit output support to PNG, PDF and SVG altho Cairo may support
    more.

INTERFACE
  CLASS METHODS
    new ( %ATTRIBUTES, [ no_defaults => 1 ] )
        Creates a new chart definition and sets any attributes passed in
        *%ATTRIBUTES*. If *no_defaults* is specified the chart will not be
        populated with default values when rendered.

    supported_types
        Returns a list of supported renderers.

  INSTANCE METHODS
    set ( %ATTRIBUTES )
        Sets a number of attributes. It is possible to set an attribute for
        a specific dataset by prepending the key with <column<gt>:. Columns
        starts at 0.

    get ( ATTRIBUTE )
        Get the value of an attribute.

    has ( ATTRIBUTE )
        Check if an attribute exists.

    add ( @ROW )
        Adds the data in *@ROW* to the chart. If the first element is a
        *Date::Simple* object the first column will be marked as the index
        column provider and sorted accordingly when rendered.

    render ( type => TYPE, to => PATH | CODE, [ as => FORMAT ] )
        Renders the chart using the renderer specified by *TYPE* and saves
        the output as *PATH*. By default the *FORMAT* is png but pdf or svg
        may be used instead.

        If the format is png it's possible to pass a CODE reference instead
        of a path in *to*. This will be called with the reference itself as
        the first argument and data as second. It may be called several
        times during rendering.

    dataset ( COLUMN )
        Returns the "VS::Chart::Dataset"-instance representing the data for
        the given column. Return undef if no such column has been added yet
        via add.

    rows
        Returns the number of rows of data added to the chart.
