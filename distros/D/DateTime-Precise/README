Package DateTime::Precise version 1.05

This is the DateTime::Precise package.  This module provides for the
representation and manipulation of (almost) arbitrary locations in
time including fractional seconds.

DateTime::Precise.pm is not intended to be a replacement for any of
the existing Date:: or Time:: modules, but you may find it useful as a
supplement.  Notable features:

  * Date and time can include fractional seconds.

  * Date is represented internally by an array of year, month, day,
    hours, minutes, seconds, and fractional seconds.  Using this method,
    dates as far back as the start of the Gregorian calendar) can be
    used.

  * Methods are provided for doing date/time calculations.
    Increment and decrement, as well as round, floor and ceil
    functions by unit (second through year) are provided, as well as
    simple date-difference operations.

  * Methods are provided for input from and output to user-specified
    formats (dprintf, dscanf, get_time, set_time, strftime).

This module is based on the DateTime module written by Greg Fast
(gdfast@usgs.gov).

REQUIREMENTS

   * Perl 5.004_04 or greater.

INSTALLATION

In order to use this package you will need Perl version 5.004_04 or
better.  Once that is completed, you install DateTime::Precise as you
would install any perl module library, by running these commands:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install

If you want to install a private copy of this package in some other
directory, then you should try to produce the initial Makefile with
something like this command:

	perl Makefile.PL LIB=~/perl

DOCUMENTATION

See the CHANGES file for a list of recent changes.  POD style
documentation is included in all modules and scripts.  These are
normally converted to manual pages end installed as part of the "make
install" process.  You should also be able to use the 'perldoc'
utility to extract documentation from the module files directly.

IMPLEMENTATION

This package is based on the DateTime package written by Greg Fast
<gdfast@usgs.gov>.  The _week_of_year routine is based on the
Date_WeekOfYear routine from the Date::DateManip package written by
Sullivan Beck.

Instead of using the string representation used in the original DateTime
package, this package represents the time internally as a seven element
array, where the elements correspond to the year, month, day, hours,
minutes, seconds, and fractional seconds.
