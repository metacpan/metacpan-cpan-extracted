This is the OpenFrame kit for Perl, version 3.00.

NAME
    OpenFrame - a framework for network enabled applications

SYNOPSIS
      use OpenFrame;

DESCRIPTION
    OpenFrame is a framework for network services serving to multiple media
    channels - for instance, the web, WAP, and digital television. It is
    built around the Pipeline API, and provides extra abstraction to make
    delivery of a single application to multiple channels easier.

GLOBAL VARIABLES
    The most important thing that this module does is provide a wrapper
    around OpenFrame specific debug information - for example, the
    information provided by OpenFrame segments.

    This variable is a hash called %DEBUG in the OpenFrame package. If you
    set the ALL key to a true value, then debugging information about all
    segments will be printed. If you want to resolve your debugging output
    to a single module, then set a key that matches the segments name to a
    true value. For example, setting
    $OpenFrame::DEBUG{'OpenFrame::Segment::HTTP::Request'} to 1 would mean
    that all the debug messages from the HTTP::Request segment would get
    printed.

SETTING UP YOUR SERVER
    This will briefly explain how to set up a stand-alone OpenFrame server.
    It uses the code listing below.

    The first few lines (01-08) simply load all the modules that are needed
    to setup the various constituent parts of an OpenFrame server. Lines 9
    creates an HTTP daemon listening on port 8080 for requests, in the case
    that the server cannot be created line 10 provides error reporting to
    the screen.

    The first real piece of OpenFrame code is found at line 14, where we
    create a Pipeline object, followed quickly by lines 16, 17 and 18 which
    create a couple of pipeline segments that will be added to the pipeline
    at line 21. Lines 24 and 26 create a loop to listen for and accept
    connections, and fetch HTTP requests from those connections as and when
    it is needed.

    At line 28 we create a Pipeline::Store::Simple object, which will act as
    our data container for the information flowing down the pipeline. We add
    the request to the store and the store to the pipeline at line 31, and
    then call the dispatch() method on the pipeline at line 34. This sets
    the OpenFrame side of things going. At line 37 we ask the pipeline for
    the store and the store for an HTTP::Response object, and then send it
    back to the client at line 40.

    The real work of OpenFrame is in the segments that are created, and the
    order in which they are inserted into the Pipeline. With this in mind,
    you know everything there is to know about OpenFrame.
