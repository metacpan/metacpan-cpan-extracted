NAME
    BackPAN::Index - An interface to the BackPAN index

SYNOPSIS
        use BackPAN::Index;
        my $backpan = BackPAN::Index->new;

        # These are all DBIx::Class::ResultSet's
        my $files    = $backpan->files;
        my $dists    = $backpan->dists;
        my $releases = $backpan->releases("Acme-Pony");

        # Use DBIx::Class::ResultSet methods on them
        my $release = $releases->single({ version => '1.23' });

        my $dist = $backpan->dist("Test-Simple");
        my $releases = $dist->releases;

DESCRIPTION
    This downloads, caches and parses the BackPAN index into a local
    database for efficient querying.

    Its a pretty thin wrapper around DBIx::Class returning
    DBIx::Class::ResultSet objects which makes it efficient and flexible.

    The Comprehensive Perl Archive Network (CPAN) is a very useful
    collection of Perl code. However, in order to keep CPAN relatively
    small, authors of modules can delete older versions of modules to only
    let CPAN have the latest version of a module. BackPAN is where these
    deleted modules are backed up. It's more like a full CPAN mirror, only
    without the deletions. This module provides an index of BackPAN and some
    handy methods.

METHODS
  new
        my $backpan = BackPAN::Index->new(\%options);

    Create a new object representing the BackPAN index.

    It will, if necessary, download the BackPAN index and compile it into a
    database for efficient storage. Initial creation is slow, but it will be
    cached.

    new() takes some options

   update
    Because it is rather large, BackPAN::Index caches a copy of the BackPAN
    index and builds a local database to speed access. This flag controls if
    the local index is updated.

    If true, forces an update of the BACKPAN index.

    If false, the index will never be updated even if the cache is expired.
    It will always create a new index if one does not exist.

    By default the index is cached and checked for updates according to
    "<$backpan-"cache_ttl>>.

   cache_ttl
    How many seconds before checking for an updated index.

    Defaults to an hour.

   debug
    If true, debug messages will be printed.

    Defaults to false.

   releases_only_from_authors
    If true, only files in the "authors" directory will be considered as
    releases. If false any file in the index may be considered for a
    release.

    Defaults to true.

   cache_dir
    Location of the cache directory.

    Defaults to whatever App::Cache does.

   backpan_index_url
    URL to the BackPAN index.

    Defaults to a sensible location.

  files
        my $files = $backpan->files;

    Returns a ResultSet representing all the files on BackPAN.

  files_by
        my $files = $backpan->files_by($cpanid);
        my @files = $backpan->files_by($cpanid);

    Returns all the files by a given $cpanid.

    Returns either a list of BackPAN::Index::Files or a ResultSet.

  dists
        my $dists = $backpan->dists;

    Returns a ResultSet representing all the distributions on BackPAN.

  dist
        my $dists = $backpan->dist($dist_name);

    Returns a single BackPAN::Index::Dist object for $dist_name.

  dists_by
        my $dists = $backpan->dists_by($cpanid);
        my @dists = $backpan->dists_by($cpanid);

    Returns the dists which contain at least one release by the given
    $cpanid.

    Returns either a ResultSet or a list of the Dists.

  dists_changed_since
        my $dists = $backpan->dists_changed_since($time);

    Returns a ResultSet of distributions which have had releases at or after
    after $time.

  releases
        my $all_releases  = $backpan->releases();
        my $dist_releases = $backpan->releases($dist_name);

    Returns a ResultSet representing all the releases on BackPAN. If a
    $dist_name is given it returns the releases of just one distribution.

  release
        my $release = $backpan->release($dist_name, $version);

    Returns a single BackPAN::Index::Release object for the given $dist_name
    and $version.

  releases_by
        my $releases = $backpan->releases_by($cpanid);
        my @releases = $backpan->releases_by($cpanid);

    Returns all the releases of a single author.

    Returns either a list of Releases or a ResultSet representing those
    releases.

  releases_since
        my $releases = $backpan->releases_since($time);

    Returns a ResultSet of releases which were released at or after $time.

EXAMPLES
    The real power of BackPAN::Index comes from DBIx::Class::ResultSet. Its
    very flexible and very powerful but not always obvious how to get it to
    do things. Here's some examples.

        # How many files are on BackPAN?
        my $count = $backpan->files->count;

        # How big is BackPAN?
        my $size = $backpan->files->get_column("size")->sum;

        # What are the names of all the distributions?
        my @names = $backpan->dists->get_column("name")->all;

        # What path contains this release?
        my $path = $backpan->release("Acme-Pony", 1.01)->path;

        # Get all the releases of Moose ordered by version
        my @releases = $backpan->dist("Moose")->releases
                                              ->search(undef, { order_by => "version" });
