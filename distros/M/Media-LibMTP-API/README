Media-LibMTP-API version 0.04, released May 31, 2014


You probably want to use Media-LibMTP instead of using this module
directly.

This module provides a low-level interface to libmtp, which is an
Initiator implementation of the Media Transfer Protocol (MTP) in the
form of a library suitable primarily for POSIX compliant operating
systems.

libmtp is not included; you must install it separately.

See http://libmtp.sourceforge.net for details.



INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

	perl Build.PL
	./Build
	./Build test
	./Build install

You may see a warning about "Use of uninitialized value
$ExtUtils::ParseXS::num in subtraction".  This appears to be harmless.
See https://rt.perl.org/rt3/Ticket/Display.html?id=112776 for details.
