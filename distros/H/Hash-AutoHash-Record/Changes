	Fixed problem with version numbers in helper and tie packages causing

1.12	2012-09-03
	- INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: no longer possible to use method notation for keys
	  with the same names as methods inherited from UNIVERSAL (the base  
	  class of everything). These are  'can', 'isa', 'DOES', and 'VERSION'.
	  The reason is that as of Perl 5.9.3, calling UNIVERSAL methods as
	  functions is deprecated and developers are encouraged to use method
	  form instead. Previous versions of module are incompatible with CPAN
	  modules that adopt this style.
	- Added test for version number in POD
	- Changes to Build.PL
	  Removed redundant 'dist_version_from' param
          Added Module::Build to configure_requires
	  Changed create_makefile_pl from deprecated 'passthrough' to 'small'
