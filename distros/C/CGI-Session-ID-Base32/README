NAME

    CGI::Session::ID::Base32 - CGI::Session ID driver based on Base32
    encoding

SYNOPSIS

        use CGI::Session;

        $session = new CGI::Session("id:Base32", undef, { Directory => '/tmp' };

DESCRIPTION

    CGI::Session::ID::Base32 is to generate Base32 encoded random ids. The
    library does not require any arguments.

     There are two reasons why to use it
      - shorter string result
      - case insensibility

    ( both very usefull for user login and other similar purposes, keyboard
    inputs, email contained codes, etc... )
