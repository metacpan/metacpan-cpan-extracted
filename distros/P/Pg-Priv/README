Pg/Priv version 0.12
====================

This module parses PostgreSQL ACL arrays and represents the underlying
privileges as objects. Use accessors on the objects to see what privileges are
granted by whom and to whom.

PostgreSQL ACLs are arrays of strings. Each string represents a single set of
privileges granted by one role to another role. ACLs look something like this:

    my $acl = [
       'miriam=arwdDxt/miriam',
       '=r/miriam',
       'admin=arw/miriam',
    ];

The format of the privileges are interpreted thus (borrowed from the
[PostgreSQL
Documentation](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/sql-grant.html#SQL-GRANT-NOTES)):

       rolename=xxxx -- privileges granted to a role
               =xxxx -- privileges granted to PUBLIC

                   r -- SELECT ("read")
                   w -- UPDATE ("write")
                   a -- INSERT ("append")
                   d -- DELETE
                   D -- TRUNCATE
                   x -- REFERENCES
                   t -- TRIGGER
                   X -- EXECUTE
                   U -- USAGE
                   C -- CREATE
                   c -- CONNECT
                   T -- TEMPORARY
             arwdDxt -- ALL PRIVILEGES (for tables, varies for other objects)
                   * -- grant option for preceding privilege

               /yyyy -- role that granted this privilege

Pg::Priv uses these rules (plus a few other gotchas here and there) to parse
these privileges into objects. The above three privileges in the ACL array
would thus be returned by `parse_acl()` as three Pg::Priv objects that you
could then interrogate.
