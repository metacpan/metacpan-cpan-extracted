Changelog for OpenFrame::Segment::Apache

1.20 Wed Nov  5 14:09:44 GMT 2003
	- require OpenFrame instead of OpenFrame::AppKit

1.10 Wed Sep  3 15:00:54 BST 2003
	- applied patch from Arthur Bergman to check for an Apache
          binary in the TEST_APACHE environment variable and to add
          Apache::Cookie as dependency
	- moved to Module::Build

1.05 Thu Dec 19 15:43:55 GMT 2002
	- minor code cleanup
	- cookies are now stringified rather than extracted, so the
	  programmer retains control over them
	- use the request scheme rather than blindly assuming HTTP
          (HTTPS should now work properly)

1.04 Fri Sep 27 13:04:20 BST 2002
	- fix embarrassing bug where cookies weren't being sent properly

1.03 Thu Sep 26 16:27:48 BST 2002
	- hmmm, a lot of releases today
	- now use the new OpenFrame::Argument::Blob so that file
	uploading works in the new OpenFrame way

1.02 Thu Sep 26 15:28:13 BST 2002
	- new OpenFrame::Segment::Apache::NoImages which lets Apache
	serve images for us (and framework to make this work and tests
	to check it works)

	- redirects now work (with tests)

1.00 Tue Aug 27 10:58:42 BST 2002
