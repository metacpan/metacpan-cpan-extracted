You install the module by running these commands:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make install


Description:

   This Perl class provides an object oriented API which lets you gather
   SETI@home stats from one or more machines and gives you a programmatic
   way of getting access to them.  It can cope with multiple SETI@home
   clients which share a directory hierarchy accessible to the machine it
   is run on, clients which each have their own private filespace (using
   rsh, ssh or equivalent) and even works for boxes running Windows NT.

   SETI::Stats borrows from Jan Rocho's perlseti.pl, but differs in
   several ways - this is a module devoted to stats gathering rather than
   a general purpose control program, it can be used to monitor remote
   machines without even requiring Perl to be installed on them, and
   it provides a generic framework for access to (both local and remote)
   SETI@home client stats.  It could also be extended to cover stats
   gathering from the SETI@home WWW server, though this may be better done
   in a separate module to avoid code bloat.
