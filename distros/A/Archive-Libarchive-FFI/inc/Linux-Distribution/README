Linux-Distribution version 0.21
===============================

This is a simple module that tries to detect on what linux distribution we are running by looking
for release's files in /etc.  It now looks for 'lsb-release' first as that should be the most cor-
rect and adds ubuntu support.  Secondly, it will look for the distro specific files.

It currently recognizes slackware, debian, suse, fedora, redhat, turbolinux, yellowdog, knoppix,
mandrake, conectiva, immunix, tinysofa, va-linux, trustix, adamantix, yoper, arch-linux, libranet,
gentoo, ubuntu, scientific, oracle enterprise linux, and redflag.

It has function to get the version for debian, suse, fedora, redhat, gentoo, slackware, scientific, oracle enterprise linux, redflag and
ubuntu(lsb). People running unsupported distro's are greatly encouraged to submit patches :-)
