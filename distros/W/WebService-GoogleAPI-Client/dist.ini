; FOR Dist::Zilla USERS (FROM 'perldoc Test::Perl::Critic' )
;       If you use Test::Perl::Critic with Dist::Zilla, beware that some DZ
;       plugins may mutate your code in ways that are not compliant with your
;       Perl::Critic rules. In particular, the standard
;       Dist::Zilla::Plugin::PkgVersion will inject a $VERSION declaration at
;       the top of the file, which will violate
;       Perl::Critic::Policy::TestingAndDebugging::RequireUseStrict. One
;       solution is to use the Dist::Zilla::Plugin::OurPkgVersion which allows
;       you to control where the $VERSION declaration appears.
