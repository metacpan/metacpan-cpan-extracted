        - No functional changes.

        - [build] Rebuild with newer Perinci::CmdLine::POD to render a more
          complete usage line of Perinci::CmdLine scripts in POD (now all
          options are listed, not just '[options]').

        - UPDATE 2020-05-02: rename version to 0.731.1.

	- Add utility: pmunlink.

	- [bugfix] Workaround Perinci::Sub::GetArgs::Argv's limitation of
	  handling case for greedy=1 and schema type is not explicitly/directly
	  'array'. This caused 'pmpath Module' and 'pmpath Module::*' to
	  work/expand correctly, but 'pmpath Module1 Module2' to become 'pmpath
	  "Module1 Module2"'.


0.728   2019-10-17  Released-By: PERLANCAR; Urgency: medium

	  element_completion property, this might be a bug). This enables
	  wildcard expanding in commands that accept multiple perl module names,
	  e.g.: 'pmpath Module::P*' or 'pmversion Module/P**'.


0.724   2019-06-20  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	  ints instead of just bools, so we can customize what type to
	  return first).

	- Add utility: podlist.

	- Fix Rinci metadata: Used wrong attribute summary.alt.bool.neg
	  instead of summary.alt.bool.not.

          This results in a convenience: you can specify Foo-Bar or Foo.Bar or
          Foo/Bar in addition to Foo::Bar and they all will be accepted and
          normalized to Foo::Bar by the coercion rule.
