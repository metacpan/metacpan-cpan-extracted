Revision history for Text-FixedWidth

        - Whoops! use %07.0f not %07d or you may suffer off-by-a-penny rounding errors. 
          Thanks mauke in irc.perl.org #perl-help

        - Added optional 'writer' subs to set_attribute for when you need to do
          magic when setting attributes. 

0.11    2013-06-09 jhannah
        - Added set_attribute(), which allows anonymous subs to be set into 'reader'
          for when simple sprintf 'format' attributes prove insufficiently flexible.

        - Found another instance of the warning below. Now tests for "" and undef.
        - Added more helpful warning instead of this Perl warning:
          Argument "" isn't numeric in sprintf at Text/FixedWidth.pm line 162.

0.05    2009-04-29 jhannah
        - Suppress spurious warnings when at attribute is explicitly set to undef.
        - Carp out a warning if the user tries to set auto_truncate() on an 
          attribute that doesn't exit.
