XML-Handler-EasyTree-Generator version 0.03
===========================================

This module provides a method for creating EasyTree structures with an interface similar to CGI.pm.

The module is plain Perl and strictly speaking it has no dependencies, though you're not liable to do much useful without an EasyTree module like XML::Parser::EasyTree, XML::Handler::Trees, or the potentially forthcoming XML::Handler::EasyTree::Searchable::Extended.
