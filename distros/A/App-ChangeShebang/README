NAME

    App::ChangeShebang - change shebang lines for relocatable perl

SYNOPSIS

        > change-shebang /path/to/bin/script.pl
    
        > head -3 /path/to/bin/script.pl
        #!/bin/sh
        exec "$(dirname "$0")"/perl -x "$0" "$@"
        #!perl

DESCRIPTION

    change-shebang changes shebang lines from

        #!/path/to/bin/perl

    to

        #!/bin/sh
        exec "$(dirname "$0")"/perl -x "$0" "$@"
        #!perl

    Why do we need this?

    Let's say you build perl with relocatable enabled
    (-Duserelocatableinc). Then the shebang lines of executable scripts
    point at the installation time perl binary path.

    So if you move your perl directory to other places, the shebang lines
    of executable scripts point at a wrong perl binary and we cannot
    execute scripts. Oops!

    A solution of that problem is to replace shebang lines by

        #!/bin/sh
        exec "$(dirname "$0")"/perl -x "$0" "$@"
        #!perl

    which means that scripts will be executed by the perl located in the
    same directory.
