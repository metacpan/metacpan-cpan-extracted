Swarm Readme
if you are reading this - ++ for bravery. There is much to do in swarm.

Padre::Plugin::Swarm 
	Needs a preferences dialog. In the very least a way to pick the 
	default transport  Multicast/IRC/XMPP/etc

[still needs identity management see ::Swarm::Identity]
In progress. -submersible

    wx  agent/service/transport layers to have their own identity, 
	outbound messages will be stamped w/ user / service / transport
	identity via UI -> Service -> Transport (duh)
	
	
Next step is to get the transport layer:
	a) installable by the masses
	b) cross linkable via ::Gateway
	c) a single padre::service that can be called easily from padre to 
		subscribe/unsubscribe new channels.
		

After which:

Fun things. 
	a) factor our chat in a plugin
	b) start on collaboration channel / client spec
	c) start on Swarm::Geometry and SwarmVerse / SwarmSpace
	d) .. implement asteroids
	e) .... implement anti-pacman
