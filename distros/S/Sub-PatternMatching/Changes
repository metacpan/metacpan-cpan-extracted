Revision history for Perl extension Sub::PatternMatching.

1.04  Mon Nov  6 09:34:11 2006
    - More distribution upgrading: examples, spec-conformant META.yml,
      clear licensing.

1.03  Tue Oct  4 21:42:26 2005
	- Fixed distribution problems.

1.02  Thu Sep 22 21:48:55 2005
	- Changed the Params::Validate dependency from version "0" to
	  at least 0.69 because versions up to 0.18 didn't support
	  validate_with() (which is used in this module) and versions
	  prior to 0.69 leaked memory when the XS implementation was
	  used.
	- Added POD tests to catch up with the rapid development in
	  testing tools availlable for QA on CPAN.

1.01  Tue Mar 23 17:44:01 2004
	- Fixed some documentation and packaging issues.

1.00  Sun Mar 21 14:22:32 2004

		-AX Sub::PatternMatching
