NAME
    Test::Exception::LessClever - (DEPRECATED) Test::Exception simplified

DEPRECATION NOTICE
    *** This module is deprecated: please do not use it! ***

    An alternative to Test::Exception that is much simpler. This alternative
    does not use fancy stack tricks to hide itself. The idea here is to keep
    it simple. This also solves the Test::Exception bug where some dies will
    be hidden when a DESTROY method calls eval. If a DESTROY method masks $@
    a warning will be generated as well.

WHY REWRITE TEST-EXCEPTION
    Here is an IRC log.

        <Exodist> wtf? Bizarre copy of HASH in sassign at /usr/lib64/perl5/5.10.1/Carp/Heavy.pm line 104
        <Exodist> hmm, it doesn't happen when I step through the debugger, that sure is helpful yessir
        <Exodist> hmm, throws_ok or dies_ok { stuff that croaks in a package used by the one being tested }, at least in this case causes that error. If I change it to eval {}; ok( $@ ); like( $@, qr// ); it works fine
        <Exodist> Ah-Ha,   earlier when I mentioned I stopped using throws_ok because of something I could not remember, this was it, I stumbled on it again!
        <confound> probably because throws_ok tries to do clever things to fiddle with the call stack to make it appear as though its guts are not being called
        <confound> less clever would be more useful

SYNOPSIS
    Pretty much a clone of Test::Exception Refer to those docs for more
    details.

        use Test::More;
        use Test::Exception;

        dies_ok { die( 'xxx' )} "Should die";
        lives_ok { 1 } "Should live";
        throws_ok { die( 'xxx' )} qr/xxx/, "Throws 'xxx'";
        lives_and { ok( 1, "We did not die" )} "Ooops we died";

        done_testing;

EXPORTABLE FUNCTIONS
    $status = live_or_die( sub { ... }, $name )
    ($status, $msg) = live_or_die( sub { ... }, $name )
        Check if the code lives or dies. In scalar context returns true or
        false. In array context returns the same true or false with the
        error message. If the return is true the error message will be
        something along the lines of 'did not die' but this may change in
        the future.

        Will generate a warning if the test dies, $@ is empty AND called in
        array context. This usually occurs when an objects DESTROY method
        calls eval and masks $@.

        *NOT EXPORTED BY DEFAULT*

    lives_ok( sub { ... }, $name )
        Test passes if the sub does not die, false if it does.

    dies_ok( sub { ... }, $name )
        Test passes if the sub dies, false if it does not.

    throws_ok( sub { ... }, qr/message/, $name )
        Check that the sub dies, and that it throws an error that matches
        the regex.

        Test fails is the sub does not die, or if the message does not match
        the regex.

    lives_and( sub {...}, $name )
        Fails with $name if the sub dies, otherwise is passive. This is
        useful for running a test that could die. If it dies there is a
        failure, if it lives it is responsible for itself.
