VERSION

    version v0.0.1

SYNOPSIS

        use OpenSMTPD::Filter;
        use OpenBSD::Pledge;
    
        pledge();
    
        my $filter = OpenSMTPd::Filter->new(
            on => {
                report => \%report_callbacks,
                filter => \%filter_callbacks,
            },
        );
    
        $filter->ready;  # Registers and starts listening for updates

DESCRIPTION

    This module is a helper to make writing OpenSMTPd
    <https://opensmtpd.org> filters in perl easier.

METHODS

 new

        my $filter = OpenSMTPd::Filter->new(
            input  => \*STDIN,  # the default
            output => \*STDOUT, # the default
            debug  => 0,        # the default,
    
            on => \%callbacks,
        );

    Instantiates a new filter ready to start handling events.

    on

          my $filter = OpenSMTPd::Filter->new(
              ...,
              on => {
                  report => { 'smtp-in' => {
                      'link-connect' => \&lookup_spf_async,
                  } },
                  filter => { 'smtp-in' => {
                      helo => \&check_spf,
                      ehlo => \&check_spf,
                  } },
              },
          );

      A hashref of events to add callbacks for. The top level is the stream
      to listen on, either report or filter. The next level is the
      subsystem which must be smtp-in. Finally the event or phase to to
      handle.

      See "REPORT AND FILTER STREAMS" for details on writing callbacks.

    input

      The filehandle used to receive messages from smtpd. Will be changed
      to binmode(":raw").

      Defaults to STDIN.

    output

      The filehandle used to send messages to smtpd. Will be changed to
      binmode(":raw").

      Defaults to STDOUT.

    debug

      Set to a true value to enable debugging. Primarily this means copying
      all lines from "input" and "output" to STDERR.

 ready

        $filter->ready;

    Processes events on "input" until it hits eof, which should only happen
    when smtpd exits.

REPORT AND FILTER STREAMS

        my $callback = sub {
            my ( $phase_or_event, $session, @extra ) = @_;
            ...;
        };

    Each stream triggers events and each event callback adds to a session
    state as well as a list of events that have been received in that
    session.

    Each callback is called with the report event or filter phase that
    triggered the callback as the first argument and a session
    datastructure as the second argument. The subsystem can be found in
    $session->{state}->{subsystem}. Some callbacks will get additional
    arguments as documented below.

    The $session hashref may contain up to three keys:

        $session = {
            state    => \%state,
            events   => \@events,
            messages => \@messages,
        };

    Nothing in this session hash is used by this module other than in each
    message, the data-line arrayref is passed to the "data-lines" filter
    and the sent-dot boolean is used to know whether to continue sending
    filter-dataline responses. This means your filters can munge the
    contents or add additional entries although care must be taken not to
    change the expected type of an entry, but adding additional keys or
    changing values will not cause issues.

    state

      This is the state filled in by the fields for each received event.
      Any tx events go into "messages" instead of this state.

      A state might loook like this, however it only contains the fields
      recieved at each point in the connection and will contain any fields
      set by a "REPORT EVENT":

          my $state = {
              version   => '0.6',
              timestamp => '1613356167.075372',
              subsystem => 'smtp-in',
              event     => 'timeout',
              phase     => 'commit',
              session   => '3647ceea74a815de',
      
              rdns      => 'localhost',
              fcrdns    => 'pass',
              src       => '[::1]:37403',
              dest      => '[::1]:25',
      
              hostname  => 'mail.example.test',
      
              method    => 'HELO',
              identity  => 'mail.afresh1.test',
      
              command   => '.',
              response  => '250 2.0.0 5e170a6f Message accepted for delivery',
      
              message   => $session->{messages}->[-1],
          };

      See the rest of this section for which events fill in each field.

    events

      This is an arrayref of hashrefs of the fields for each recieved
      message, each hashref contains all fields supplied by that report
      event or filter phase. In addition, the event includes a request
      field indicating whether the event was a report or a filter.

          my $event = {
              request   => 'report',
              version   => '0.5',
              timestamp => '1576146008.006099',
              subsystem => 'smtp-in',
              event     => 'link-connect',
              session   => '7641df9771b4ed00',
              rdns      => 'mail.openbsd.org',
              fcrdns    => 'pass',
              src       => '199.185.178.25:33174',
              dest      => '45.77.67.80:25',
          };

    messages

      Message states collect the fields provided by each tx-* "REPORT
      EVENT" for each message-id in a session.

          my $message' = {
              'message-id'  => '48f59d87',
              'envelope-id' => '48f59d87264c2287',
              'mail-from',  => 'andrew',
              'rcpt-to',    => ['afresh1'],
              'data-line'   => [
                  'Received: from mail (localhost [::1])',
                  '   by mail.example.test (OpenSMTPD) with SMTP id 48f59d87',
                  '   for <afresh1@mail.afresh1.test>;',
                  '   Sat, 27 Feb 2021 20:56:38 -0800 (PST)',
                  'From: andrew',
                  'To: afresh1',
                  'Subject: Hai!',
                  '',
                  'Hello There',
                  '.'
              ],
              'result'   => 'ok',
              'sent-dot' => 1,
          };

      The "tx-from" and "tx-rcpt" events are handled specially and go into
      the mail-from, rcpt-to, and result fields. The rcpt-to ends up in an
      arrayref as the message can be destined for multiple recipients. If a
      "data-lines" filter exists, the data-line field is also an arrayref
      of each line that has been recieved so far, with the CR and LF
      removed. The sent-dot field is a boolen indicating whether this
      message has sent the . indicating it is complete.

 REPORT EVENT

        my $callback = sub {
            my ( $event, $session ) = @_;
            ...;
            return 'anything'; # ignored
        };

    All report events will provide these fields:

    version

    timestamp

    subsystem

    event

    session

    suffix

    Events for the subsystem below may include additional fields.

    smtp-in

      link-connect

	rdns

	fcrdns

	src

	dest

      link-greeting

	hostname

      link-identify

	method

	identity

      link-tls

	tls-string

      link-disconnect

      link-auth

	username

	result

      protocol-client

	command

      protocol-server

	response

      filter-report

	filter-kind

	name

	message

      filter-response

	phase

	response

	param

      timeout

 MESSAGE REPORT EVENTS

        my $callback = sub {
            my ($event, $session) = @_
            my $message = $session->{state}->{message};
            ...;
        };

    All filters that begin with tx- include a message-id field and possibly
    other fields. These events add to the last item in "messages", which is
    also added as the message field in the session "state".

    message-id

    Message events for the smtp-in subsystem may include additional fields.

    tx-reset

    tx-begin

    tx-mail

      result

      mail-from

	The address field for a tx-mail event is recorded as the mail-from
	in the message.

    tx-rcpt

      result

      rcpt-to

	The address field for a tx-rcpt events are recorded in the rcpt-to
	arrayref in the message.

    tx-envelope

      envelope-id

    tx-data

      result

    tx-commit

      message-size

    tx-rollback

 FILTER REQUEST

        my $callback = sub {
            my ( $phase, $session, @data_lines ) = @_;
            ...;
            return $response, @params;
        };

    See "FILTER RESPONSE" for details about what can be returned.

    The "data-line" and "data-lines" callbacks are special in that they
    also recieve the current data-line or all lines recieved. They should
    also return a list of "dataline" responses instead of the normal
    decision response.

    All filter events have these fields:

    version

    timestamp

    subsystem

    phase

    session

    opaque-token

    Specific filter events for each subsystem may include additional
    fields.

    smtp-in

      connect

	rdns

	fcrdns

	src

	dest

      helo

	identity

      ehlo

	identity

      starttls

	tls-string

      auth

	auth

      mail-from

	address

      rcpt-to

	address

      data

      commit

    data-line

      The data-line and data-lines callbacks are special in that they
      return a list of "dataline" responses and not a normal "FILTER
      RESPONSE".

      The returned lines are split on \n so you can return a single string
      that is the entire message and it will be split into individual
      "dataline" responses.

      You can return any number of lines from an individual data-line
      callback until you recieve the single . indicating the end of the
      message. When you recieve the single . as the line you will need to
      finish processing the message and return any lines that are still
      pending.

      line

    data-lines

      This is a wrapper around the "data-line" callback to make it easier
      to process the entire message instead of dealing with it on a
      line-by-line basis and having to store it yourself.

      See the "BUGS AND LIMITATIONS", although this seemed like a good
      idea, to better support pledge it might go away and leave
      implementing data-line storage to the filter author.

      lines

	The final argument is an arrayref of all lines in the message.

  FILTER RESPONSE

    The return value from a "FILTER REQUEST" callback determines what will
    be done with the message.

    dataline

      This is the special response used by "data-line" filters. There is
      special processing that if the returned line contains newlines it
      will be split into multiple responses.

      line

    proceed

          my $callback = sub {
              ...;
              return 'proceed';
          };

      This is the normal response, it means the message will continue to
      additional filters and if all filters return proceed the message will
      be accepted.

    junk

          my $callback = sub {
              ...;
              return 'junk';
          };

      Like "proceed" but will add an X-Spam header to the message.

    reject

          my $callback = sub {
              ...;
              return reject => "400 Not Sure";
          };

      You must provide a valid SMTP error message as the second argument to
      the return value including the status code, 5xx or 4xx.

      A 421 status will "disconnect" the client.

      error

    disconnect

          my $callback = sub {
              ...;
              return disconnect => "550 Go Away";
          };

      As with "reject" the return from this callback must include a valid
      SMTP error message including the status code. However, like a 421
      "reject" status, all messages will disconnect the client.

      error

    rewrite

          my $callback = sub {
              my ($phase, $session) = @_;
              ...;
              if ( $phase eq 'tx-rcpt' ) {
                   my $event = $session->{events}->[-1];
                   return rewrite => 'afresh1'
                       if $event->{address} eq 'andrew';
              }
              return 'proceed';
          };

      parameter

    report

      Generates a "filter-report" event with the parameter as the message
      that will be reported. I'm not entirely sure where they get reported
      to, I assume maybe any later filters.

      I believe you would do something like this, and that you could
      generate any supported event, but I haven't had good luck with it.

          my $s = $_[1]->{state};
          printf $output "%s|"%010.06f"|%s|%s|%s|%s\n";
              'report', Time::HiRes::time,
              $s->{subsystem}, 'filter-response', $s->{session},
              $parameter
          );

      This is not a result response.

      parameter

BUGS AND LIMITATIONS

    The received "data-line" are stored in a list in memory if a
    "data-lines" filter exists, which could easily be very large if the
    message is sizable. These should instead be stored in a temporary file.

    There is currently no way to stop listening for specific report events,
    this module should provide a way to specify which events it should
    listen for and gather state from.
