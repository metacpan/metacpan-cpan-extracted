MP3-CreateInlayCard README
================================

Reads a directory of MP3s, and produces a HTML file you can print for a nice
"inlay" for a CD case.  Useful if you're burning a directory full of MP3s
to a CD, and want an inlay label created for you.

Assumes that the tracks will be burnt to the CD in the same order we see them
in the directory.
