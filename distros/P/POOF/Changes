Revision history for Perl extension POOF.

0.01  Tue Apr  1 12:00:23 2008
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.23 with options
		-AX -b 5.6.0 -n POOF
        
1.0   Many changes and new features, more info to come in the future.

1.1   Cleanup and added documentation. Changed most POOF methods to be prefixed with "p".

1.2   Added more documentation and removed Data::Dumper from all code.  Also increased
      the minimum Perl version required to 5.7+ as there were some failures on Perl 5.6.2.
      If someone out there figures out what the actual failure is and can submit a patch
      or suggestions on how to fix it, I will gladly implement them.

1.3   Added some important credit where credit is due.

1.4   David Hand:  Made to work in taint mode.
