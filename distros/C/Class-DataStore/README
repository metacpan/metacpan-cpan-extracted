Class::DataStore 0.07
=====================

DESCRIPTION

Class::DataStore implements a simple storage system for object data.  This data
can be accessed via get/set methods and AUTOLOAD. AUTOLOAD calls are not added
to the symbol table, so using get/set will be faster.

This module was written originally as part of a website framework that was used
for the Democratic National Committee website in 2004. Some of the
implementations here, such as get() optionally returning a list if called in
array context, reflect the way this module was originally used for building web
applications.

Class::DataStore is most useful when subclassed. To preserve the AUTOLOAD
functionality, be sure to add the following when setting up the subclass:

  use base 'Class::DataStore';
  *AUTOLOAD = \&Class::DataStore::AUTOLOAD;
															
This module is also a useful add-on for modules that need quick and simple data
storage, e.g. to store configuration data:

  $self->{_config} = Class::Datastore->new( $config_data );
  sub config { return $_[0]->{_config}; }
  my $server = $self->config->server;
  my $sender = $self->config->get( 'sender' );

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install
