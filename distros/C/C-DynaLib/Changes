	  Convert::Binary::C struct parser.

0.58  2008-06-29 12:59:11 rurban
	removed C::DynaLib::Struct::VERSION
	work on failing win32 test

0.57  2008-01-18 12:34:43 rurban
	Fix optimize for non-gcc, non-msvc
        define $C::DynaLib::decl to "cdecl", "hack30", ...

0.56  2005-09-20 18:34:43 - 2007-12-26 22:38:11 rurban
	Maintainer changed to Reini Urban <rurban@cpan.org>
	Allow to build under cygwin and gcc >= 3.4
	Added script/pl2exe.pl, moved tests to t/

0.55  Fri Feb 11 19:54:34 EST 2000
	Allow to build with recent perls.

0.53  Sat Oct 25 12:47:32  1997
	Improved error checking and reporting.  Function calls occur
in the sub declarer's package.  Second arg to C::DynaLib->new will be
passed along to DynaLoader::dl_load_file.

0.52  Sat Oct 18 18:41:42  1997
	Some efforts toward portability, especially among Sparc
compilers.

0.51  Fri Oct  3 23:55:27  1997
	Renamed as C::DynaLib.  Fixed Makefile.PL bug that resulted
in NUL chars in DynaLib.c.  Errors in loading libs, finding symbols,
and allocating callbacks are no longer fatal.

0.50  Sat Sep 27 01:35:55  1997
	Much nicification and many added arg/return types.  Rewrote
a lot of the guts.

0.31  Thu Aug 28 23:42  1997
	Digital Unix on the Alpha is supported, at least for gcc,
thanks to help from Achim Bohnet <ach@mpe.mpg.de>.  Added PTR_TYPE.

0.30  Mon Aug 11 00:58:55  1997
	Added testcall configuration utility to find system
dependencies for cdecl convention.  Rewrote some docs.

0.22  Wed Jul 30 01:12 1997
	Renamed methods to avoid possible future keyword conflict:
declare_sub became DeclareSub, poke became Poke, etc.  Added
ExtUtils::DynaLib::Struct package.  Got it to work on Windows 95 with
Borland C++ (but probably not repeatably ;-) )

0.21  Sat Jul 12 02:01:12  1997
	die works with callbacks (except in certain complex cases).
Added a few bits & pieces.
Sun's cc is now supported (thanks to lvirden@cas.org).

calling convention

0.03  Sun Jun 15 22:56:26  1997
	Fixed problem with Perl prototypes.

0.02  Sat Jun 14 19:22:36  1997
