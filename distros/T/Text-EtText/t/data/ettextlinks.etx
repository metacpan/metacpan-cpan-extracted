LINKS TEST
----------

This is a test of a single-word link [1], same with text label [txtlink],
a "multi-word link test" [2].

  [1]: http://jmason.org/
  [txtlink]: http://slashdot.org/
  [2]: http://www.ntk.net/

As you can see, the link lists do not need to occur at the end of the
document, they can occur immediately after the paragraph they are used
in. However the link labels must be unique throughout the doc.

Another point is that the presence of the link labels must not cause
side-effects in the output, such as producing extra empty paragraph tags
or that kind of thing.

Better make sure that links work OK when no whitespace is used in
the link text[scoop]. And how's about a "glossary link"?

  [scoop]: http://sitescooper.cx/
  [glossary link]: http://jmason.org/

Or a "onewordgloslink"?

  [onewordgloslink]: http://sourceforge.net/

Links can be used anywhere in the content, even if they were defined
far above. Here's a link to NTK [2].

Of course, EtText links should not screw up <a href=http://webmake.taint.org>
traditional a hrefs</a>. And tags with embedded quotes should be OK too, even
if they too use an EtText link...  <img
src="http://jmason.org/license_plate.jpg" width="10" height="10"> [homepage].

  [homepage]: http://jmason.org/

Here's an odd one. EtText links should be ok when you use both text and a tag
in the "link text <img src=http://sitescooper.cx/new.gif>" [scoop].

Traditional hrefs on images should be OK too, like this: <a
href=http://webmake.taint.org><img src="http://jmason.org/license_plate.jpg"
width="10" height="10"></a>.

This should be a link: http://webmake.taint.org/ . Also
http://webmake.taint.org , with URL: <URL:http://webmake.taint.org/>

Links follows by non-link chars: http://webmake.taint.org/,
http://webmake.taint.org/. (blah blah http://webmake.taint.org/)

That's it. Oh, one more -- since ''test_requires_this_warning'' has not be
defined as a link label, "test_requires_this_warning" is not a link (but it
should produce a warning).

This should be a link: URL:http://webmake.taint.org/
url:http://webmake.taint.org/ .

Test links containing colons. an EtLink: "HTML::Mason" [mason], a trad link: <a
href="http://www.masonhq.org/">HTML::Mason</a>.

Here's a new feature -- link text recogition: this is a test of linktext.
That should be a href...
