DESCRIPTION

This module provides the following functions:

    cp932_to_utf8()    converts CP932 to UTF-8.
    cp932_to_utf16le() converts CP932 to UTF-16LE (little endian).
    cp932_to_utf16be() converts CP932 to UTF-16BE (big endian).
    cp932_to_utf32le() converts CP932 to UTF-32LE (little endian).
    cp932_to_utf32be() converts CP932 to UTF-32BE (big endian).

    utf8_to_cp932()    converts UTF-8    to CP932.
    utf16le_to_cp932() converts UTF-16LE to CP932.
    utf16be_to_cp932() converts UTF-16BE to CP932.
    utf32le_to_cp932() converts UTF-32LE to CP932.
    utf32be_to_cp932() converts UTF-32BE to CP932.

    utf16_to_cp932()   converts UTF-16   to CP932.
    utf32_to_cp932()   converts UTF-32   to CP932.

In addition, the XSUB edition supports the following functions
(REQUIRES Perl 5.6.1 or later).

    cp932_to_unicode() converts CP932 to Unicode [*].
    unicode_to_cp932() converts Unicode [*] to CP932.

    [*] .. Perl's internal format. see perlunicode.pod in Perl 5.6.1 or later.


DEPENDENCIES

XSUB edition:   Perl 5.6.1 or later

Non-XS edition: Perl 5.003 or later
               (Perl 5.005 or later Recommended)

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

If Perl 5.6.1 or later, XSUB will be installed.
If you don't have a C compiler, try to install pure Perl as below.

If Perl 5.6.0 or before, XSUB will be automatically disabled
and pure Perl will be installed.

If you have a C compiler and want to use XSUB edition,
type the following (!! "enableXS" must run before "Makefile.PL" !!):

   perl enableXS
   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

If you decide to install pure Perl (i.e. non-XS) edition after trying
to build XSUB, type the following:

   make clean
   perl disableXS
   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

Note:

(1) The file MapUTF.pmN is required to build XSUB.
    Don't delete it before the install completes.

(2) Pure Perl edition, MapUTF.pmN, may work without any other file
    in this distribution (it must be renamed MapUTF.pm, though)
  * Tests (in t/*.t files) require MapUTF/Supplements.pm, too.
