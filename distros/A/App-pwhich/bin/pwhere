=head1 NAME

pwhere - Pure Perl implementation of where

=head1 VERSION

version 1.17

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 $ pwhere perl

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<pwhere> is a command-line utility program for finding paths to other
programs based on the user's C<PATH>. It is similar to the usually Unix
tool `where', and tries to emulate its functionality, but is written
purely in Perl (uses the module C<File::Which>), so is portable.

=head1 SUPPORT

Bugs should be reported via the GitHub issue tracker
L<https://github.com/uperl/App-pwhich/issues>
For other issues, contact the maintainer.

=head1 CAVEATS

This module does not know about built-in shell commands, as the built-in
command C<which> and C<where> usually do.

This module is fully supported back to Perl 5.8.1.  It may work on 5.8.0.

If you want these executables installed without the C<p> prefix
(useful on platforms like windows that do not have their own
native which or where), set C<PERL_APP_PWHICH_NO_PREFIX> to
C<no-prefix> during install of this module.
