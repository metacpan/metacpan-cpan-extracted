Its fleece was white as snow<br/>

The lamb was sure to go.

<p>In every job that must be done, there is an element of fun.<br/>
Find the fun and snap!  The job's a game.<br/>
And every task you undertake, becomes a piece of cake,<br/>
a lark, a spree; it's very clear to see.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;-- Mary Poppins
