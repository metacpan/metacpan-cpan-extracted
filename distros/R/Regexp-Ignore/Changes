	- I had a stupid loop in the merge method. I changed it with 
	  one regexp line and got an extremely large performance 
	  improvement on big files.

        - Fixed the copyright notice. 
        - Changed IgnoreTextCharacteristicsHTML::get_tokens - was
	  checking if there was text before certain token by checking 
	  if ($`). Yet, if the text before is '0', this condition will
	  return false! Fixed it to (length($`)).
        - Besides, the class is old enough to add the comment that it
          probably actually works :-)
