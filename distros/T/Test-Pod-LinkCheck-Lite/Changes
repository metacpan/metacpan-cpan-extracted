    Skip URL links with server (5xx) errors.  This is controlled by
    Boolean attribute skip_server_errors, which is true by default.  The
    default behaviour is a change from version 0.001, which generated a
    failed test in this case. The logic (if any) is that status 5xx can
    represent an actual server error rather than an incorrect link.
