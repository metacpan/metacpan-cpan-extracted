=head1 METHODS

=head2 TO_JSON

Serialize the trace to JSON. This method should be called only by L<JSON> serializer.

=head2 type

Trace type.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=over

=item * autocolorscale

Determines whether the colorscale is a default palette (`autocolorscale: true`) or the palette determined by `colorscale`. In case `colorscale` is unspecified or `autocolorscale` is true, the default  palette will be chosen according to whether numbers in the `color` array are all positive, all negative or mixed.

=item * below

Determines if the densitymapbox trace will be inserted before the layer with the specified ID. By default, densitymapbox traces are placed below the first layer of type symbol If set to '', the layer will be inserted above every existing layer.

=item * coloraxis

Sets a reference to a shared color axis. References to these shared color axes are *coloraxis*, *coloraxis2*, *coloraxis3*, etc. Settings for these shared color axes are set in the layout, under `layout.coloraxis`, `layout.coloraxis2`, etc. Note that multiple color scales can be linked to the same color axis.

=item * colorbar

=item * colorscale

Sets the colorscale. The colorscale must be an array containing arrays mapping a normalized value to an rgb, rgba, hex, hsl, hsv, or named color string. At minimum, a mapping for the lowest (0) and highest (1) values are required. For example, `[[0, 'rgb(0,0,255)'], [1, 'rgb(255,0,0)']]`. To control the bounds of the colorscale in color space, use`zmin` and `zmax`. Alternatively, `colorscale` may be a palette name string of the following list: Greys,YlGnBu,Greens,YlOrRd,Bluered,RdBu,Reds,Blues,Picnic,Rainbow,Portland,Jet,Hot,Blackbody,Earth,Electric,Viridis,Cividis.

=item * customdata

Assigns extra data each datum. This may be useful when listening to hover, click and selection events. Note that, *scatter* traces also appends customdata items in the markers DOM elements

=item * customdatasrc

Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  customdata .

=item * hoverinfo

Determines which trace information appear on hover. If `none` or `skip` are set, no information is displayed upon hovering. But, if `none` is set, click and hover events are still fired.

=item * hoverinfosrc

Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  hoverinfo .

=item * hoverlabel

=item * hovertemplate

Template string used for rendering the information that appear on hover box. Note that this will override `hoverinfo`. Variables are inserted using %{variable}, for example "y: %{y}". Numbers are formatted using d3-format's syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for example "Price: %{y:$.2f}". https://github.com/d3/d3-3.x-api-reference/blob/master/Formatting.md#d3_format for details on the formatting syntax. Dates are formatted using d3-time-format's syntax %{variable|d3-time-format}, for example "Day: %{2019-01-01|%A}". https://github.com/d3/d3-3.x-api-reference/blob/master/Time-Formatting.md#format for details on the date formatting syntax. The variables available in `hovertemplate` are the ones emitted as event data described at this link https://plot.ly/javascript/plotlyjs-events/#event-data. Additionally, every attributes that can be specified per-point (the ones that are `arrayOk: true`) are available.  Anything contained in tag `<extra>` is displayed in the secondary box, for example "<extra>{fullData.name}</extra>". To hide the secondary box completely, use an empty tag `<extra></extra>`.

=item * hovertemplatesrc

Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  hovertemplate .

=item * hovertext

Sets hover text elements associated with each (lon,lat) pair If a single string, the same string appears over all the data points. If an array of string, the items are mapped in order to the this trace's (lon,lat) coordinates. To be seen, trace `hoverinfo` must contain a *text* flag.

=item * hovertextsrc

Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  hovertext .

=item * ids

Assigns id labels to each datum. These ids for object constancy of data points during animation. Should be an array of strings, not numbers or any other type.

=item * idssrc

Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  ids .

=item * lat

Sets the latitude coordinates (in degrees North).

=item * latsrc

Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  lat .

=item * lon

Sets the longitude coordinates (in degrees East).

=item * lonsrc

Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  lon .

=item * pmeta

Assigns extra meta information associated with this trace that can be used in various text attributes. Attributes such as trace `name`, graph, axis and colorbar `title.text`, annotation `text` `rangeselector`, `updatemenues` and `sliders` `label` text all support `meta`. To access the trace `meta` values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use `%{meta[i]}` where `i` is the index or key of the `meta` item in question. To access trace `meta` in layout attributes, use `%{data[n[.meta[i]}` where `i` is the index or key of the `meta` and `n` is the trace index.

=item * metasrc

Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  meta .

=item * name

Sets the trace name. The trace name appear as the legend item and on hover.

=item * opacity

Sets the opacity of the trace.

=item * radius

Sets the radius of influence of one `lon` / `lat` point in pixels. Increasing the value makes the densitymapbox trace smoother, but less detailed.

=item * radiussrc

Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  radius .

=item * reversescale

Reverses the color mapping if true. If true, `zmin` will correspond to the last color in the array and `zmax` will correspond to the first color.

=item * showscale

Determines whether or not a colorbar is displayed for this trace.

=item * stream

=item * subplot

Sets a reference between this trace's data coordinates and a mapbox subplot. If *mapbox* (the default value), the data refer to `layout.mapbox`. If *mapbox2*, the data refer to `layout.mapbox2`, and so on.

=item * text

Sets text elements associated with each (lon,lat) pair If a single string, the same string appears over all the data points. If an array of string, the items are mapped in order to the this trace's (lon,lat) coordinates. If trace `hoverinfo` contains a *text* flag and *hovertext* is not set, these elements will be seen in the hover labels.

=item * textsrc

Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  text .

=item * transforms

=item * uid

Assign an id to this trace, Use this to provide object constancy between traces during animations and transitions.

=item * uirevision

Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name` and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`. Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`, `selectedpoints` is controlled by `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)` (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove traces before the end of the `data` array, such that the same trace has a different index, you can still preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a `uid` that stays with it as it moves.

=item * visible

Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If *legendonly*, the trace is not drawn, but can appear as a legend item (provided that the legend itself is visible).

=item * z

Sets the points' weight. For example, a value of 10 would be equivalent to having 10 points of weight 1 in the same spot

=item * zauto

Determines whether or not the color domain is computed with respect to the input data (here in `z`) or the bounds set in `zmin` and `zmax`  Defaults to `false` when `zmin` and `zmax` are set by the user.

=item * zmax

Sets the upper bound of the color domain. Value should have the same units as in `z` and if set, `zmin` must be set as well.

=item * zmid

Sets the mid-point of the color domain by scaling `zmin` and/or `zmax` to be equidistant to this point. Value should have the same units as in `z`. Has no effect when `zauto` is `false`.

=item * zmin

Sets the lower bound of the color domain. Value should have the same units as in `z` and if set, `zmax` must be set as well.
