    - According to changes in Minion v10.00, now it's possible, for locks, to be
      reset without resetting the whole queue. Now, in reset, it's mandatory to
      explicitly state what needs to be destroyed.

    - MongoDB's primary key (_id) is an object (BSON::OID) so ids of workers,
      jobs and so on are currently objects too. This is ambiguous because, when
      search for a specific id, Pg backend expected a string and also returned
      ids are strings (integers). To remove this ambiguity, now every external
      reference ids are strings as an hexadecimal rappresentation of internal
      BSON::OID object. If you need the id as an object, backend exports an
      experimental _oid method which converts a 24-length hexadecimal strings
      into a BSON::OID.
    - Removed a memory leak while reading notifications table
    - Solved bug in job->note when no arguments passed (issues/3)
    - Optimization in job->note where now you can set/remove items at one time
