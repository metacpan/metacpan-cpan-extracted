XML::SMART

XML::Smart - A smart, easy and powerful way to access or create XML from files, data and URLs.

DESCRIPTION

This module provides an easy way to access/create XML data. It's based on a HASH
tree created from the XML data, and enables dynamic access to it through the 
standard Perl syntax for Hash and Array, without necessarily caring about which 
you are working with. In other words, B<each point in the tree works as a Hash and
an Array at the same time>!

This module additionally provides special resources such as: search for nodes by 
attribute, select an attribute value in each multiple node,  change the returned 
format, and so on.

The module also automatically handles binary data (encoding/decoding to/from base64),
CDATA (like contents with <tags>) and Unicode. It can be used to create XML files,
load XML from the Web ( just by using an URL as the file path ) and has an easy
way to send XML data through sockets - just adding the length of the data in
the <?xml?> header.

You can use I<XML::Smart> with L<XML::Parser>, or with the 2 standart parsers of
XML::Smart:

   XML::Smart::Parser 
   XML::Smart::HTMLParser
