NAME

wax - webify your CLI

SYNOPSIS

    wax [OPTIONS] program [OPTIONS] ...

e.g.:

    $ wax vim -R https://registry.npmjs.org/left-pad/-/left-pad-1.2.0.tgz

runs:

    $ vim -R /tmp/wax_abcd1234.tgz

DESCRIPTION

wax is a command-line program which runs other command-line programs and converts their URL arguments to local file paths. By default, the files are removed after the command has exited.

As well as adding transparent support for remote resources to commands that don't support them natively, wax can be used to:

- add support for HTTPS (and any other protocols supported by LWP [1]) to programs that only support HTTP [2]
- add a mirroring layer to network requests (remote resources are only fetched if they've been updated)
- add a caching layer to network requests (remote resources are only fetched once)

For more details, see the wax man page.
