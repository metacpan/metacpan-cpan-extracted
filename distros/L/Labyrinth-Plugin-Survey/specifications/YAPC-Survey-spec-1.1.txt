DESCRIPTION

This document describes version 1.1 of the YAPC Survey YAML file specification.

The SURVEY.yml file describes the content for a survey, consisting of sections, questions and options. This file is intended to be used to plug into the Labyrinth website framework, which provides a parser to convert the YAML into a data structure. The internal data structure can then be used to display the survey to a respondant, or to reference the recorded results submitted by the respondant.

Note: The latest stable version of this specification can always be found at http://www.missbarbell.co.uk/labyrinth/YAPC-Survey-current.txt, with the latest development version available at http://www.missbarbell.co.uk/labyrinth/YAPC-Survey-blead.txt. Note that the development version may include entries that are only under discussion, which may not feature in a final release.

FORMAT

Each SURVEY.yml file is written in the YAML format (see http://www.yaml.org/).

TERMINOLOGY

respondant
    The person expected to take part in the survey.

survey
    A collection of sections, questions and options.

section
    One or more sections, which split the survey into manageable chunks for a respondant to read.

HEADER

The first line of a SURVEY.yml file should be a valid YAML document header like "--- #YAML:1.0".

FIELDS

The remainder of the SURVEY.yml file is a single YAML mapping whose keys are described here. However, the fields are split into two groups. The Informational Fields provide information regarding the survey or the SURVEY.yml file. The Content Fields are those that contain the sections and questions relating to the survey itself.
