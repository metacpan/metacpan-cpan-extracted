NAME

    Alien::Build::Plugin::Fetch::HostAllowList - Require that Alien::Build
    based aliens only fetch from an allow list of hosts

VERSION

    version 0.02

SYNOPSIS

    Using with environment variables only:

     export ALIEN_BUILD_PRELOAD=Fetch::HostAllowList
     export ALIEN_BUILD_HOST_ALLOW=github.com,ftp.gnu.org

    Using from ~/.alienbuild/rc.pl:

     preload_plugin 'Fetch::HostAllowList', allow_hosts => [qw( github.com ftp.gnu.org )];

DESCRIPTION

    This is an Alien::Build plugin that will, when enabled, reject any
    fetch requests made by an Alien::Build based Alien that are fetching
    from a remote host that is not in the provided allow list.

    Aliens that bundle packages are not affected, as this plugin does not
    check file URLs.

    If no allow list is specified (either via the property or environment
    variable, see below) then no remote hosts will be allowed.

PROPERTIES

 allow_hosts

     plugin 'Fetch::HostAllowList', allow_hosts => \@hosts;

    The list of domains that are allowed. Should be provided as an array
    reference. If not provided, then ALIEN_BUILD_HOST_ALLOW will be used
    (see below).

ENVIRONMENT

    ALIEN_BUILD_HOST_ALLOW

      Comma separated list of hosts to allow. If not specified when the
      plugin is applied then this list will be used.
