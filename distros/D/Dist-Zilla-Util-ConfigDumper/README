Dist::Zilla::Util::ConfigDumper

This module contains a utility function for use within the "Dist::Zilla"
plugin ecosystem, to simplify extraction of plugin settings for plugin
authors, in order for plugins like "Dist::Zilla::Plugin::MetaConfig" to
expose those values to consumers.

Primarily, it specializes in:

*   Making propagating configuration from the plugins inheritance
    hierarchy nearly foolproof.

*   Providing simple interfaces to extract values of lists of named
    methods or accessors

*   Providing a way to intelligently and easily probe the value of lazy
    attributes without triggering their vivification.
