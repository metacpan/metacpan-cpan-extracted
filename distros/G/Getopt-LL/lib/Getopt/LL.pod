     my $use_foo = 0;
 
     my $options = getoptions({
         '-t'            => 'string',

         '--use-foo'     => sub {
             $use_foo = 1;
         },
         '-output|-o'    => sub {
             my ($getopt, $node) = @_;
             my $next_arg = $getopt->get_next_arg($node);
 
             if ($next_arg eq '-') {
                 $out_to_stdout = 1;
             }
 
             return $next_arg;
         };
     });

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Getopt::LL provides several ways for defining the arguments you want.
There is L<Getopt::LL::Simple> for defining arguments on the -use-line-,
L<Getopt::LL::Short> for abbreviated rules (that looks like L<Getopt::Long>).

=head2 RULES

-Rules- is the guidelines Getopt::LL follows when it meets new options.
The rules defines what options we want, which options are required,
and what to do with an option.

A simple rule-set could be written like this:

     my $rules = {
         '-foo'      => 'string',
         '-bar'      => 'string',
         '--verbose' => 'digit',
         '--debug'   => 'flag',
     };

=head3 Rule typesE<sol>actions.

The argument to an rule is what we call a rule type or rule action.
It can be one of the following:

=over

=item *

C<<< 'flag' >>>

=back

The option is a flag. The value of the option will be boolean true.

=over

=item *

C<<< 'string' >>>

=back

The option is a string. The value of the option will be the next argument
in the argument list.

=over

=item *

C<<< 'digit' >>>

=back

The option is a number. The value of the option will be the next argument
in the argument list. The value will be sent to C<<< is_digit($value) >>> to check
that it's really a number. If it's not a number and the C<<< die_on_type_mismatch >>>
option is set, the program will die with a type mismatch error message.

A digit can also be a hex value if it begins with -0x-, any hex value
will be converted to a decimal value.

=over

=item *

A regular expression: C<<< qr/ / >>>

=back

The next argument will be matched against the regular expression.
If it doesn't match the program will die with the message

     Argument [--arg] doesn't match [regular-expression].

=over

=item *

An anonymous subroutine. C<<< sub { } >>>

=back

The sub-routine will be called with the following arguments

=over

=item 1.

C<<< $_[0] >>> - The Getopt::LL object.

=item 2.

C<<< $_[1] >>> - The current argument node (A Getopt::LL::DLList::Node] object).

=item 3.

C<<< $_[2] >>> - The argument name.

=item 4.

C<<< $_[3] >>> - If an argument value was set by the user with C<<< --arg=value >>>, the value is in this variable.

=back

The return value of the anonymous subroutine will be the value of the option.

Here is an example of a rule sub that simply assigns the value of the next
argument to the option value:

     my $rules = {
 
         '-foo'  => sub {
             my ($getopt, $node, $arg_name, $arg_value) = @_;
                 return $arg_value if $arg_value;
 
                 my $next_arg = $getopt->get_next_arg($node);
 
                 return $next_arg;
         },
     };
 
     my $result = getoptions($rules);
 
     print 'FOO IS: [', $result->{'-foo'}, "]\n";

if this program is called with the arguments: C<<< -foo bar >>> or C<<< -foo=bar >>> it will
print out this message:

     FOO IS [bar]

=head3 Specifying required arguments.

There are two ways of specifying required arguments.

=over

=item *

Embedded in the rule name, by an exclamation point B<!>.

=back

     my $rules = {
         '-foo!' => 'string',
     };

=over

=item *

Or by adding the C<<< required >>> flag.

=back

     my $rules = {
         '-foo'  => {
             type        => 'string',
             required    => 1,
         },
     }

=head3 Adding default values to non-required arguments.

There are two ways of specifying default values.

=over

=item *

Embedded in the rule name, inside parens B<( .. )>

=back

     my $rules = {
         '-bar(defaultValue)' => 'string',
     };

=over

=item *

Or by adding a C<<< default >>> key to the spec.

=back

     my $rules = {
         '-bar'  => {
             type    => 'string',
             default => 'defaultValue',
         },
     };

=head2 DID YOU SAY SIMPLE?

With L<Getopt::LL::Simple> you can define the arguments you want on the
-use-line-:

     #!/usr/bin/perl
     use strict;
     use warnings;
 
     # we have three arguments:
     #   -f!          (our filename, which is a s(tring) the ! means that it's
     #               a required argument.
     #   --verbose   (print extra information about what we're doing, is a flag).
     #   --debug     (the level of debugging information to print. is a
     #                d(igit).
     #
     use Getopt::LL::Simple qw(
         -f!=s
         --verbose
         --debug|d=d
     );
 
     if ($ARGV{'--verbose'}) {
         print "In verbose mode...\n";
     }
 
     if ($ARGV{'--debug'}) {
         print 'Debugging level is set to: ', $ARGV{'--debug'}, "\n";
     }
 
     print "The contents of @ARGV is:\n";
     prnit "\t", join{q{, }, @ARGV), "\n";

The options that was found is placed into C<<< %ARGV >>>, the arguments that is not
an option is placed into C<<< @ARGV >>>. So say we have run the program with the
following arguments:

     ./myprogram -f tmp.log --verbose --debug=3 foo bar

or

     ./myprogram -f tmp.log --verbose --debug 3 foo bar

it will give this output:

     In verbose mode...
     Debugging level is set to: 3
     The contents of @ARGV is:
         foo, bar 

=head1 SUBROUTINESE<sol>METHODS

=head2 CONSTRUCTOR

=head3 C<<< new(\%rules, \%options, \@opt_argv ) >>>

Uses C<<< @ARGV >>> if no C<<< \@opt_argv >>> is present.

=head2 ATTRIBUTES

=head3 C<<< rules >>>

=head3 C<<< set_rules >>>

The list of rules passed to C<<< new >>>.

=head3 C<<< options >>>

=head3 C<<< set_options >>>

The options passed  to C<<< new >>>.

=head3 C<<< dll >>>

=head3 C<<< set_dll >>>

Our arguments converted to a doubly linked list.
(is a L<Getopt::LL::DLList> object).

=head3 C<<< result >>>

=head3 C<<< set_result >>>

The final argument hash.

=head3 C<<< leftovers >>>

=head3 C<<< set_leftovers >>>

Array of items in the argument list that does not start with B<-> or B<-->.

=head2 INSTANCE METHODS

=head3 C<<< parseoption($argument, $node) >>>

This method is called for each argument to decide what to do with it.

=head3 C<<< find_arg_type($argument) >>>

Find out what kind of argument this is.

If the argument starts with B<-> (a single dash) it returns C<<< short >>>,
but if it starts with B<--> (two dashes) it returns C<<< long >>>.

=head3 C<<< is_string($value, $option_name) >>>

Check if value is a proper string.

=head3 C<<< is_digit($value, $option_name) >>>

Check if value is a digit. (C<<< 0-9+ >>>)
If value starts with -0x-, it is treated as a hex value.

=head3 C<<< type_mismatch_error($type, $message) >>>

Called whenever a type does not match it's requirements.

=head3 C<<< unknown_argument_error($argument) >>>

Called when a argument that has no rule is found.
(turn off by setting the C<<< allow_unspecified >>> option to a true value).

=head3 C<<< handle_rule($option_name, $rule, $node) >>>

Called when C<<< parseoption() >>> finds an argument that we have an existing rule for.
This function decides what to do with the argument based on it's C<<< RULE_ACTION >>>.

=head3 C<<< get_next_arg($node) >>>

Get and delete the next argument.
(Gets the next node in our doubly linked list and deletes the current node)

=head3 C<<< peek_next_arg($node) >>>

Look at the next argument, but don't delete it.

=head3 C<<< get_prev_arg($node) >>>

Get and delete the previous argument.

=head3 C<<< peek_prev_arg($node) >>>

Look at the previous argument, but don't delete it.

=head2 C<<< delete_arg($node) >>>

Deletes the argument.

=head2 C<<< rules_prepare(\%rules) >>>

Find and prepare aliases in the rule set.

=head2 C<<< rules_postactions( ) >>>

Things to do with rules after argument processing is done.
Like adding default values for arguments with default values defined and
checking for required arguments.

=head2 C<<< show_help( ) >>>

Print help for arguments to standard error.
This is experimental and the implementation is not exactly complete.

=head2 C<<< show_usage( ) >>>

Print usage to standard error.
This is experimental and the implementation is not exactly complete.

=head2 CLASS METHODS 

=head3 C<<< getoptions(\%rules, \%options, \@opt_argv) >>>

Parses and gets arguments based on the rules in C<<< \%rules >>>.
Uses C<<< @ARGV >>> if C<<< \@opt_arg >>> is not specified.

Returns hash with the arguments it found.
C<<< @ARGV >>> is replaced with the arguments that does not start with B<-> or B<-->.

=head3 C<<< opt_String($help_for_option) >>> 

Shortcut for writing:

     {
         type => 'string',
         help => $help_for_option,
     }

=head3 C<<< opt_Digit($help_for_option) >>> 

Shortcut for writing:

     {
         type => 'digit',
         help => $help_for_option,
     }

=head3 C<<< opt_Flag($help_for_option) >>> 

Shortcut for writing:

     {
         type => 'flag',
         help => $help_for_option,
     }

=head2 PRIVATE INSTANCE METHODS

=head3 C<<< _init() >>>

Called by new to traverse and parse the doubly linked list of arguments.

=head3 C<<< _warn(@messages) >>>

Print a warning on the screen, but only if C<<< $options->{silent} >>> is not set.

=head2 PRIVATE CLASS METHODS

=head3 C<<< _regex_as_text($regex) >>>

Quoted regexes are not very user-friendly to print directly, so this
function turns a quoted regex like:

     (?xmsi:hello)

into:

     /hello/xmsii
