1.07    2015-09-29
        * In Tk::FromUI::Field::Directory, removed "-mustexist" option so
          the chooseDirectory() will work in linux.
        * Updated tests to remove calls to diag() that are not needed

1.06    2015-09-28
        * Updated tests to skip on systems that do not have an X Server

          by CPAN Testers service.

        * The set_field_data() now will silently return if a parameter is
          not provided.
        * For the Entry field, added trim_leading and trim_trailing attributes
          to control trimming of leading and trailing whitespace when the
          value() method is called. Both attributes default to 1
