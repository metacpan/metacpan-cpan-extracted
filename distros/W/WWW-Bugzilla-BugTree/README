NAME

    WWW::Bugzilla::BugTree - Fetch a tree of bugzilla bugs blocking a bug

VERSION

    version 0.07

SYNOPSIS

     use WWW::Bugzilla::BugTree;
     
     my $tree = WWW::Bugzilla::BugTree->new(
       url => 'http://bugzilla',
     );
     
     # $bug isa WWW::Bugzilla::BugTree::Bug
     my $bug = $tree->fetch(749922);
     print $bug;
     foreach my $subbug (@{ $bug->children })
     {
       print $bug;
     }

DESCRIPTION

    This module provides a way to fetch a tree of dependent bugs from
    Bugzilla. You give it a bug id and it returns a tree of all the bugs
    that bug depends on (or all the bugs that are blocking your bug). I
    wrote this to use the XML output of Bugzilla's show_bug.cgi page
    because we are still using Bugzilla 3.6, which doesn't provide
    dependency information via its API, which would probably be faster.

    There is also a companion script bug_tree which will print out the tree
    for you with pretty colors indicating each bug's status.

ATTRIBUTES

 ua

     my $lwp = $tree->ua;

    Instance of LWP::UserAgent used to fetch information from the bugzilla
    server.

 url

     my$url = $tree->url

    The URI of the bugzilla server. You may pass in to the constructor
    either a string or a URI object. If you use a string it will be
    converted into a URI.

    If not provided it falls back to using the BUG_TREE_URL environment
    variable, and if that isn't set it uses this bugzilla provided for
    testing:

    https://landfill.bugzilla.org/bugzilla-3.6-branch

METHODS

 fetch

     my $bug = $tree->fetch($id);

    Fetch the bug tree for the bug specified by the given id. Returns an
    instance of WWW::Bugzilla::BugTree::Bug.

 clear_cache

     $tree->clear_cache;

    Clears out the cache.
