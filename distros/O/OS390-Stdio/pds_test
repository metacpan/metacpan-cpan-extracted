In order to test the OS390::Stdio::pds_mem() routine
I will need the name of a readable partitioned data set 
(PDS) and a readable non PDS (e.g. a sequential data set).

Input_pds:

print "What is the name of your test PDS? ", 
      $pds_def ? "[$pds_def] " : '';

For testing I now need to know the name of a readable data set 
that is not a PDS.  For example, a sequential data set will do.
