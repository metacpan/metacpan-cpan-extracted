    - fix a few typos in the documentation
    - no functional changes

0.09 2023-08-04
    - fix scoping of loops in sub-templates (i.e. 'replace_inner_template' or
      'replace_outer_template' embedding a template that uses 'repeat_inner' or
      'repeat_outer'); this could cause errors like "Use of uninitialized value
      in concatenation (.) or string at .../HTML/Blitz/CodeGen.pm line 387."

0.08 2023-07-12
    - switch license from AGPLv3 to GPLv3
    - increase test coverage

0.07 2023-03-19
    - reduce dependencies by switching to 'feature' (i.e. 'no feature
      "indirect"') instead of 'indirect' and Test2 instead of Test::More,
      Test::Builder, Test::Fatal
    - extend basic benchmark to cover Mojo::Template, Text::Xslate,
      HTML::Template, and HTML::Template::Pro
    - include benchmark files in the distribution
    - add example to documentation for autogenerating script hashes from
      template files for CSP
    - extend test suite to cover more of HTML::Blitz::Builder, rule conflicts,
      and HTML syntax corner cases

0.06 2023-02-19
    - allow <math/> and <svg/> (i.e. math and svg elements can be self-closing)
    - treat param as void in the parser
    - treat basefont, bgsound, frage, keygen, parser as void in HTML::Blitz::Builder
    - include the name of the template in the generated code so error messages
      don't just refer to "(eval 42)"

0.05 2023-02-11
    - fatalize 'uninitialized' warnings; i.e. templates will now die() if they
      encounter undefined variables
    - treat basefont, bgsound, frame, keygen as void elements; i.e. they cannot
      have content or close tags
    - special-case the contents of script, style, and title elements; they
      cannot have child elements and (in the case of style and script) they
      don't support HTML entities to escape text contents

0.04 2023-01-25
    - selectors: fix parsing of escape sequences in attribute names
      (e.g. `[foo\00002dbar="baz"]`)
    - selectors: fix parsing of escape sequences in quoted attribute values
      (e.g. `[foo-bar="b\000061z"]`)

0.03 2023-01-23
    - implement full selector combinators (A B, A > B, A ~ B, A + B)
    - support <![CDATA[...]]> sections inside <math> and <svg>

0.02 2022-11-16
    - raise required perl version to 5.24 (for postderef feature)
    - implement FREEZE/THAW on HTML::Blitz::Template

0.01 2022-11-13
    - initial release
