0.08	2008-12-08
	* added examples/catalog-lwp_handlers.pl to MANIFEST
	* changed examples/catalog.pl to show saving directly to file
		by using content_filter => $filename
	* examples/catalog2db.pl updated to reflect catalog.xml scheme change
	* now defulats ->ua attribute in the constructor, instead of waiting
		for first invocation of _submit().
	* if content_filter exists and is a scalar, then use it as the
		filename to write to instead of content being in memory.

0.07	2008-11-17
	* refactored the internal methods that wrap Net::OAuth calls.
	* made the underlying LWP::UserAgent an attribute. (Jim Spath)
	* added t/urlappender.t
	* additional tests for error handling in t/access_token.t

0.06	2008-11-16
	* Support for basic resources (e.g. catalog) w/o requiring access_token.
		(Thanks to Jim Spath for the Net::OAuth subclass)
	* Added t/catalog.t to test w/o access_token.
	* Require Net::OAuth >= 0.13 Net::OAuth::ConsumerRequest
	* t/api.t -- added sleep(1)'s to avoid 'Over queries per second limit'.

0.05	2008-10-21
	* added examples/catalog.pl -- pulls entire catalog down to catalog.xml.
	* added examples/search.pl -- uses the catalog api to search for a term.
	* added examples/catalog2db.pl -- converts catalog.xml to a SQLite database.
	* changed the content-related attributes/behavior.  Now is much more memory
		efficient. _set_content() takes and stored a scalar ref, so large
		(for example the catalog index) content is copied around. Also, the
		content_filter isn't used until the first invocation of content(),
		at which point the results are cached in the _filtered_content attribute.
	* t/attributes.t updated accordingly.
	* updated EXAMPLES pod.
	* updated ATTRIBUTES pod.
	* added t/rest2sugar.t to MANIFEST
