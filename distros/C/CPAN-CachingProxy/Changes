1.6500: Fri Jan 20 2012
   - added support for http ranges from rfc2616§14

1.6000: Tue Jan 03 2012
   - Nobody really uses this but me I guess; otherwise someone
     surely would have noticed the various timing problems with
     the cache by now.

     I have resolved them with lockfiles (for now).  I haven't
     thought of a better solution, and I think this will work
     fine.  I'd like to do better.  But, then, I'd also like to
     support file download continuations.  Ahh, later.

1.5000: Sun Aug 21 2011
   - I made sure needed slashes are are in the URL.  I was seeing
     a trouble where http://host/cpan-proxy was giving incorrect
     results in my browser, but http://host/cpan-proxy/ was fine.
     There is now a 302 redirect to add the tail-slash if it is
     absent — specifically: when path_info() is “”.
   - Cache misses used to be written to the cache completely
     before any chunks were sent to the client.  Fixed.  Cache
     miss chunks are now sent to the client as they are received.
   - Caching of failures works slightly differently... no reason
     to store the actual page result.  A 404 is a 404.  Showing,
     "FAIL: text instead."
   - do not send charset information, it's probably lies
   - send content length and etag headers
   - taught CCP how to check last-modified headers

   - t/01_mg-new_auto.t is failing on like 10% of the perl5.10s,
     but why?  It makes no sense.  I've made it more verbose...
     what else can I do?

1.4001: Tue Mar 24 14:29:58 EDT 2009
   - pulled in chorny's Makefile.PL
     (http://github.com/chorny/cpan--cachingproxy/tree/master)
   - The new META.yml stuff is really neat.

1.4: Tue Mar 24 11:52:10 EDT 2009
   - RSRCHBOY requested that the $pinfo regexp be converted to a
     package option.  That change has been made.

1.3: Mon Aug 18 09:07:51 EDT 2008
   - found a few variable name bugs/typos
   - added a couple more expiration options
   - added an LWP timeout option

1.2: Tue Aug 12 07:19:25 EDT 2008
   - I taught the cache about an alternate expiration for the
     index files.  It makes sense to only cache them for a
     shorter while...

1.1: Thu Aug  7 16:04:01 EDT 2008
   - ditched version.pm
   - re-wrote a couple of examples and docs
     (the key_space stuff)
   - minor path patch

1.0.3: Sat May 31 09:22:38 EDT 2008
   - wow, wasn't using the this->{ua}.  instantiated it, but
     never used it.  brilliant.

1.0.2: Tue May 27 10:17:15 EDT 2008
   - minor doc changes
   - minor updates to the backend URL construction
   - made the DEBUG messages optoinal and not default
   - fixed a very minor bug in the mirror urlification
   - (wow, use version has to be on the same line as our $VERSION
      for older EUMM)

1.0.1: Mon May 26 15:32:02 EDT 2008
   - I might as well do a new version of everything using
     version.pm while I wait for all my CPAN deletes to go
     through.  I just discovered that version.pm doesn't/didn't
     go core until perl 5.9...  I really wish I'd have prereqed
     it everywhere I used it, but I didn't.  *sigh*

1.0.0: Sat May 24 09:31:16 EDT 2008
   - using version.pm as suggested by Andreas Koenig
