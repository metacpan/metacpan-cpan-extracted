DESCRIPTION
    This module generates pronuceable passwords, based the the English
    digraphs by D Edwards.

  METHODS
    new
          $pp = Text::Password::Pronounceable->new($min, $max);
          $pp = Text::Password::Pronounceable->new($len);

        Construct a password factory with length limits of $min and $max. Or
        create a password factory with fixed length if only one argument is
        provided.

    generate
          $pp->generate;
          $pp->generate($len);
          $pp->generate($min, $max);

          Text::Password::Pronounceable->generate($len);
          Text::Password::Pronounceable->generate($min, $max);

        Generate password. If used as an instance method, arguments override
        the factory settings.
