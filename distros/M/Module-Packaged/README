NAME
    Module::Packaged - Report upon packages of CPAN distributions

SYNOPSIS
      use Module::Packaged;

      my $p = Module::Packaged->new();
      my $dists = $p->check('Archive-Tar');
      # $dists is now:
      # {
      # cpan    => '1.08',
      # debian  => '1.03',
      # fedora  => '0.22',
      # freebsd => '1.07',
      # gentoo  => '1.05',
      # openbsd => '0.22',
      # suse    => '0.23',
      # }

      # meaning that Archive-Tar is at version 1.08 on CPAN but only at
      # version 1.07 on FreeBSD, version 1.05 on Gentoo, version 1.03 on
      # Debian, version 0.23 on SUSE and version 0.22 on OpenBSD

DESCRIPTION
    CPAN consists of distributions. However, CPAN is not an isolated system
    - distributions are also packaged in other places, such as for operating
    systems. This module reports whether CPAN distributions are packaged for
    various operating systems, and which version they have.

    Only CPAN, Debian, Fedora (Core 2), FreeBSD, Gentoo, Mandrake (10.1),
    OpenBSD (3.6) and SUSE (9.2) are currently supported. I want to support
    everything else. Patches are welcome.

    The data is fetched from the net and cached for an hour.

METHODS
  new()
    The new() method is a constructor:

      my $p = Module::Packaged->new();

  check()
    The check() method returns a hash reference. The keys are various
    distributions, the values the version number included:

      my $dists = $p->check('Archive-Tar');
