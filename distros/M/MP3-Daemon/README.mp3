DESCRIPTION
    I have combined my favourite features of dcd, cdcd, and mpg123 to create
    Yet Another Front-End For Mpg123. Mine is special, though. ;-)

    From dcd, I derived the ability to fork itself into the background.

    From cdcd, I derived its intuitive interface.

    With mpg123, I do the CPU-intensive work of actually playing the mp3s.

    The end result is an MP3 player that is compliant with the
    UNIX::Philosophy. Note that mp3 does not have a Captive User Interface.
    Requests are made by mp3 to an MP3::Daemon::Simple and mp3 returns
    immediately after getting a reply. The commands that generate output do
    so on STDOUT. This makes mp3 easy to combine with other Unix utilities
    via pipes and filters.

COMMANDS
    Most of these commands are self-explanatory. One thing that may confuse
    some people is that the playlist has a zero-based index. Otherwise, if
    you're familiar with the cdcd interface, this should feel vaguely
    familiar.

    add     This adds mp3s to the playlist. Multiple files may be specified.

    del     This deletes items from the playlist by index. More than one
            index may be specified. If no index is specified, the current
            mp3 in the playlist is removed. Indices may also be negative in
            which case they count from the end of the playlist.

    play    This plays the current mp3 if no other parameters are given.
            This command also takes an optional parameter where the index of
            an mp3 in the playlist may be given.

    next    This loads the next mp3 in the playlist.

    prev    This loads the previous mp3 in the playlist.

    pause   This pauses the currently playing mp3. If the mp3 was already
            paused, this will unpause it. Note that using the play command
            on a paused mp3 makes it start over from the beginning.

    rw      This rewinds an mp3 by the specified amount of seconds.

    ff      This fastforwards an mp3 by the specified amount of seconds.

    jump    This will go directly to a part of an mp3 specified by seconds
            from the beginning of the track. If the number of seconds is
            prefixed with either a "-" or a "+", a relative jump will be
            made. This is another way to rewind or fastforward.

    stop    This stops the player.

    time    This sends back the index of the current track, the amount of
            time that has elapsed, the amount of time that is left, and the
            total amount of time. All times are reported in seconds.

    info    This sends back information about the current track.

    ls [-fl] [REGEX]
            First, a warning -- I'm beginning to realize how GNU/ls became
            so bloated. The "ls" interface should not be considered stable.
            I'm still playing with it.

            This sends back a list of the titles of all mp3s currently in
            the playlist. The current track is denoted by a line matching
            the regexp /^>/.

            -f      This makes "ls" return a listing with index and
                    filename.

            -l      This makes "ls" return a long listing that includes
                    index, title, and filename.

            [REGEX] This allows one to filter the playlist for only titles
                    matching this regex. Of course, one may use grep,
                    instead.

    rand    Calling this with no parameters toggles the random play feature.
            Randomness can be set to be specifically "on" or "off" by
            passing the scalar "on" or "off" to this method.

    loop    This option controls the playlist's looping behaviour. When
            called with a parameter, loop can be set to "all", "single", or
            "off". Calling this with no parameters displays the current
            looping status.

    quit    This unloads the MP3::Daemon::Simple that was automagically
            spawned when you first invoked mp3.

    kill    If for some reason the daemon hangs on you, you can use this as
            a last resort.

  The UNIX::Philosophy In Action

    Saving playlists

        mp3 ls -f | perl -pe 's/.*\d+ //' > playlist

    Loading a playlist

        xargs mp3 add < playlist

    Deleting songs 6..12

        mp3 del `seq 6 12`

    Sorting your playlist from shortest to longest mp3

        mp3 ls -l | sed 's/^>/ /' | sed 's/:/./' | sort -g -k 2

    Playing part of an mp3 over and over again

        while true ; do mp3 j 1300 ; sleep 386 ; done

    Monitoring the progress of the daemon

        watch mp3 time
        watch mp3 info

FILES
    $HOME/.mp3/mp3_socket
        This is the socket used to communicate with the daemon. In the event
        that the daemon is not cleanly shut down, this file may need to be
        deleted before another MP3::Daemon::Simple can be started up.

    $HOME/.mp3/mp3.pid
        This is the pid of the daemonized process.

    The UNIX Philosophy
        If you want to know what UNIX is all about, check this book out.
        It's only 151 pages, and it's really easy and fun to read. Some
        parts are a little biased and/or dated, but there is still a lot of
        wisdom in it. I highly recommend it.
