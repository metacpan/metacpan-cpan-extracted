NAME
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Git::Tag::ForRelease - Create a Release Tag Before
    Building the Distribution.

VERSION
    version v0.05

SYNOPSIS
    In your dist.ini:

      [Git::Check]           ; Check that everything has been checked in.
      [Git::Tag::ForRelease] ; Create a new release version tag.

DESCRIPTION
    This plugin attempts to tag the current repository with an appropriate
    new version number.

ATTRIBUTES
  repo_dir
    The Git repository location. Defaults to the current dir.

  base_version
    The version number to use for the very first commit, if one doesn't
    exist. defaults to '0.00';

  alpha_format
    The sprintf string to use to generate an alpha version. Defaults to
    '%d.%02d_%03d'

  version_format
    The sprintf string to use to generate a regular version number. Defaults
    to '%d.%02d'

  tag_prefix
    This string is prepended to the version number to form the tag name to
    tag the repository with. Defaults to 'v'

  matches
    This is a regex string that is used when searching the repository for
    the latest tag to increment. Only the latest tag matching this regex
    will count as a version tag to be incremented. By default this value is
    empty, so all tags are considered to be version tags.

  tag_trials
    Normally, a release built with the 'dzil release --trial' command does
    not result in an actual tag being committed to the repository, unless
    this attribute has been set.

  debug
    If turned on, the plugin will produce some debugging output while
    working.
