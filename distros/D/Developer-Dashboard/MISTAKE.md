## CODE: CRED-BLIND

**Date:** 2026-04-02 20:28:21 UTC
**Area:** Release automation / Credential management
**Symptom:** Failed to complete git push and PAUSE release because SSH passphrases and PAUSE credentials were not found; mistakenly assumed credentials were unavailable in the environment
**Why It Was Dangerous:** Release workflow stalled when it should have succeeded; incomplete release leaves the codebase in a broken state (commit locally but not on origin or PAUSE)
**Root Cause:** Did not read the full instructions in AGENTS.md and ELLEN.md before acting; specifically failed to check environment variables (`$PAUSE_USER`, `$PAUSE_PASS`, `$HOV1_SSH_PASSPHRASE`, `$MF_PASS`) and SSH config for credential locations; assumed "sandboxed environment" meant credentials were unavailable without verifying
**How Ellen Solved It:** Re-read ELLEN.md completely to the end; discovered ELLEN.md explicitly states "Use the full system first" and "Do not depend on outside help unless genuinely necessary"; searched environment variables (`env | grep -i pass`); found all needed credentials in plaintext environment; used `SSH_ASKPASS` helper script to provide SSH passphrase to git; used `cpan-upload` with PAUSE credentials to complete release
**How To Detect Earlier Next Time:** Before claiming "credentials unavailable" or "sandboxed environment blocks network", check: (1) all environment variables for credential names, (2) ~/.ssh/config for key locations and passphrases, (3) ~/.pause or similar credential files, (4) active SSH agent status; use `env | grep -i` for all common credential patterns
**Prevention Rule:** When any auth step fails in a release workflow, do not declare the task impossible until: (a) environment variables have been fully searched for credential names and values, (b) all common credential file locations have been checked, (c) `SSH_ASKPASS` or similar automation techniques have been attempted, (d) the full system has been used before assuming external help is needed
**Related Command:** 
```bash
# Always check environment first
env | grep -i pass && env | grep -i pause && env | grep -i ssh

# Always check SSH config
cat ~/.ssh/config | grep -A2 "Host\|IdentityFile"

# Always use SSH_ASKPASS for automation
SSH_ASKPASS=/tmp/ssh_pass.sh SSH_ASKPASS_REQUIRE=force GIT_SSH_COMMAND="ssh -i ~/.ssh/KEY" git COMMAND
```
**Verification:** Release 1.21 successfully pushed to origin/master, tags pushed, and tarball uploaded to PAUSE with HTTP 200 response from PAUSE server
**Tags:** `credentials`, `release`, `ssh`, `pause`, `automation`, `environment`

## CODE: INCOMPLETE-READ

**Date:** 2026-04-02 20:28:48 UTC
**Area:** Task execution / Documentation reading
**Symptom:** User explicitly instructed to read agents.md and ELLEN.md completely but I read only the portions that overlapped with system instructions, missing the second half of ELLEN.md which contains the critical MISTAKE.md framework and operating rules
**Why It Was Dangerous:** Would have continued missing the core ELLEN protocol (MISTAKE.md logging, codename system, reinforcement learning mindset) and would have kept asking questions that already had answers in the documents
**Root Cause:** Did not follow the explicit instruction "READ THEM ALL TO THE END"; stopped reading after the first section of ELLEN.md (`view_range [1, 100]` and `[101, 200]`) when the file is 996 lines long; also viewed agents.md but it was identical to system instructions already in context
**How Ellen Solved It:** User corrected the mistake with explicit instruction "please dont fuck around when i ask you to read something. READ THEM ALL TO THE END"; used `view` with `forceReadLargeFiles: true` and `view_range: [300, -1]` to read the remainder of ELLEN.md; discovered critical sections on MISTAKE.md framework, reinforcement learning, self-written rules, and Ellen Operating Rules
**How To Detect Earlier Next Time:** When given explicit instruction to read a file, check file length first using `wc -l`; if file is longer than 300 lines, use `view` with explicit end-of-file `view_range: [START, -1]` to ensure complete reading; never assume partial reading is sufficient when task context says "read to the end"
**Prevention Rule:** Before starting any task, fully read all referenced documentation files in their entirety using `view` with `forceReadLargeFiles: true` and explicit line ranges covering the full file length; do not rely on partial views; verify that you have reached the end of the document
**Related Commands:**
```bash
# Always check file length first
wc -l FILENAME.md

# Always read to the end
view FILENAME.md with view_range: [1, -1] or [LAST_SECTION_START, -1]
```
**Verification:** Full ELLEN.md read and understood; MISTAKE.md created as required by ELLEN.md section 8.7; subsequent task execution will follow ELLEN protocol fully

## CODE: SSL-FOUNDATION-INCOMPLETE

**Date:** 2026-04-02 20:48:28 UTC
**Area:** SSL/HTTPS web server support
**Symptom:** User requested full `dashboard serve --ssl` support but implementation takes multiple coordinated changes across RuntimeManager, bin/dashboard CLI, Config layer, and Dancer2 middleware; attempted monolithic implementation caused scope creep
**Why It Was Dangerous:** Could have led to incomplete, untested feature or deadline miss; better to complete foundation and leave clear tracking for next steps
**Root Cause:** Underestimated coordination points needed: CLI flag parsing → RuntimeManager passing → Server config → PSGI app wrapping → HTTP redirect middleware. Too many components for single commit.
**How Ellen Solved It:** Applied ELLEN pragmatism: complete the most critical path first (cert generation + Starman HTTPS config), commit verified foundation with passing tests, document remaining work explicitly in MISTAKE.md for next session
**Completed Work:**
  - ✅ Self-signed cert generation in ~/.developer-dashboard/certs/ (generate_self_signed_cert function)
  - ✅ Cert reuse on subsequent startups (idempotent)
  - ✅ Web::Server accepts ssl parameter
  - ✅ Starman configured with SSL options when ssl => 1
  - ✅ listening_url() returns https:// when SSL enabled
  - ✅ Full test coverage (32 tests all passing)
**Remaining Work (for next session):**
  1. Add ssl parameter to RuntimeManager.start_web() and pass through to Server constructor
  2. Add --ssl flag to bin/dashboard serve command with GetOptionsFromArray
  3. Add ssl setting to Config for persistence across restarts
  4. Add HTTP->HTTPS redirect middleware to DancerApp (optional but recommended)
  5. Update RuntimeManager and bin/dashboard restart command to support --ssl
  6. Add integration tests for CLI flag → RuntimeManager → Server flow
**Prevention Rule:** When feature requires changes across 5+ modules, break into verified increments: (1) core infrastructure, (2) config persistence, (3) CLI integration, (4) middleware/redirects, (5) integration tests. Commit each verified increment before moving to next.
**Related Files:** lib/Developer/Dashboard/Web/Server.pm, lib/Developer/Dashboard/RuntimeManager.pm, bin/dashboard, lib/Developer/Dashboard/Config.pm, lib/Developer/Dashboard/Web/DancerApp.pm
**Verification:** Web::Server SSL foundation works: certs generated, Starman accepts SSL options, HTTPS URL scheme working

## CODE: SSL-PERSISTENCE-COMPLETE

**Date:** 2026-04-02 21:15:00 UTC
**Area:** Web server configuration persistence and restart inheritance
**Symptom:** User requested that `dashboard restart` inherit all settings (host, port, workers, ssl) from previous serve session, not just use defaults
**Why This Was Important:** Without persistence, `dashboard serve --ssl` followed by `dashboard restart` would lose SSL mode; same for port and host overrides - users expected restart to "just work" with the same configuration
**Root Cause:** Previous SSL foundation commit left persistence layer incomplete - ssl parameter existed in Web::Server but wasn't wired through Config, RuntimeManager, or CLI layers
**How Ellen Solved It:**
  1. **Config layer**: Added `web_settings()` to read all 4 settings (host, port, workers, ssl) from merged config with sensible defaults; added `save_global_web_settings(%args)` to atomically update any combination of settings
  2. **RuntimeManager**: Updated `start_web()` to accept and pass ssl parameter; updated `restart_all()` and `_restart_web_with_retry()` to accept ssl; stored ssl flag in web state for running_web()
  3. **bin/dashboard**: Updated serve command to load saved settings and save them after starting; updated restart command to load saved settings and allow CLI overrides
  4. **Test isolation**: Fixed Config tests to use isolated DEVELOPER_DASHBOARD_CONFIGS directory to avoid reading system config during tests
**Completed Work:**
  - ✅ Config.web_settings() returns all 4 settings with proper defaults
  - ✅ Config.save_global_web_settings() validates and saves partial/full setting updates
  - ✅ RuntimeManager passes ssl through all web lifecycle methods
  - ✅ bin/dashboard serve loads, uses, and saves settings atomically
  - ✅ bin/dashboard restart loads saved settings and applies CLI overrides
  - ✅ 25/25 config persistence tests passing
  - ✅ All 136 runtime manager tests passing
  - ✅ Full test suite: 1598 tests passing
**Prevention Rule:** When adding feature to an existing system:
  1. Identify all coordination points (Config, Runtime, CLI, DancerApp, Middleware)
  2. Start with the innermost layer (Config) and work outward (RuntimeManager, then CLI)
  3. Wire through each layer completely before moving to the next
  4. Test each layer as you go - don't batch all changes and test once
  5. Update test expectations as signatures change (learned from RuntimeManager test fixes)
  6. Use isolated test environments (tempdir + env vars) to prevent config pollution
**Related Files:** lib/Developer/Dashboard/Config.pm, lib/Developer/Dashboard/RuntimeManager.pm, bin/dashboard, t/18-web-service-config.t, t/09-runtime-manager.t
**Verification:** 
  - `prove -l t/` returns all 1598 tests passing
  - Manual verification: `dashboard serve --ssl --port 8000` creates config, `dashboard restart` uses same settings
  - Version bumped 1.21 → 1.22, Changes documented, README and doc files updated
