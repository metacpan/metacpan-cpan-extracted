NAME
    Aspect::Library::Profiler - reusable method call profiling aspect

SYNOPSIS
      # profile all subs on SlowObject
      aspect Profiler => call qr/^SlowObject::/;

      # will be profiled
      SlowObject->foo;

      # will not
      FastObject->bar;

SUPER
    Aspect::Modular

DESCRIPTION
    This class implements a reusable aspect that profiles subroutine calls.
    It uses "Benchmark::Timer" to profile elapsed times for your calls to
    the affected methods. The profiling report will be printed to "STDERR"
    at the end of program execution.

    The design comes from "Attribute::Profiled" by Tatsuhiko Miyagawa.

WHY
      +-------------+
      |      A      |
      +-------------+
      | X -> Y <- Z |
      +-^-----------+

    Suppose you want to profile some code, call it "X", part of a larger
    program, called "A". So you run your program under a profiler, and
    notice most of the time is spent not in "X", but in "Y". "X" uses "Y",
    but so does "Z". You only want to profile how "X" uses "Y", not how "Z"
    uses "Y". This is where this aspect can help- you can install a
    profiling aspect with a "cflow()" pointcut, to profile only usage of "Y"
    by code in the call flow of "X".

SEE ALSO
    See the Aspect pods for a guide to the Aspect module.

    You can find an example of using this aspect in the "examples/"
    directory of the distribution.
