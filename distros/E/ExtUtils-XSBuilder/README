OVERVIEW
========

ExtUtils::XSBuilder is a set modules to parse C header files and create XS
glue code and documentation out of it. Idealy this allows to "write" an
interface to a C library without coding a line. Since no C-API is ideal,
some adjuments are necessary most of the time. So to use this module you
must still be familar with C and XS programming, but it removes a lot of
stupid work and copy&paste from you. Also when the C API changes, most
of the time you only have to rerun XSBuilder to get your new Perl API.


INSTALLATION
============


perl Makefile.PL
make install
