NAME

    Software::License::CCpack - Software::License pack for Creative
    Commons' licenses

SYNOPSIS

        use Software::License::CC_BY_4_0;
     
        my $license = Software::License::CC_BY_4_0->new({
           holder => 'Brendan Byrd',
        });
     
        print $license->fulltext;

DESCRIPTION

    This "license pack" contains all of the licenses from Creative Commons,
    except for CC0, which is already included in Software::License.

    Note that I don't recommend using these licenses for your own CPAN
    modules. (Most of the licenses aren't even compatible with CPAN.)
    However, S:L modules are useful for more than mere CPAN::Meta->license
    declaration, so these modules exist for those other purposes.

AVAILABILITY

    The project homepage is

    The latest version of this module is available from the Comprehensive
    Perl Archive Network (CPAN). Visit http://www.perl.com/CPAN/ to find a
    CPAN site near you, or see
    https://metacpan.org/module/Software::License::CCpack/.
