NAME
    DBIx::Class::InflateColumn::DateTime::Duration - Auto create
    DateTime::Duration objects from columns

SYNOPSIS
    Load this component and then declare one or more columns as duration
    columns.

      package Holiday;
      __PACKAGE__->load_components(qw/InflateColumn::DateTime::Duration Core/);
      __PACKAGE__->add_columns(
          length => {
              datatype      => 'varchar',
              size          => 255,
              is_nullable   => 1,
              is_duration   => 1,
          },
      );

    Then you can treat the specified column as a DateTime::Duration object.

      print 'days: ', $holiday->length->delta_days, "\n";
      print 'hours: ', $holiday->length->delta_hours, "\n";

DESCRIPTION
    This module inflates/deflates designated columns into DateTime::Duration
    objects.

METHODS
  register_column
    Chains with the "register_column" in DBIx::Class::Row method, and sets
    up duration columns appropriately. This would not normally be directly
    called by end users.

SEE ALSO
