Revision history for Perl extension Net::SNMP::XS

1.33  Fri Dec 21 12:20:00 CET 2018
	- no functional changes.
	- use new MakeMaker feature to properly declare dependency on
          Canary::Stability (reported by Alexander Karelas).
        - use common::sense.
        - remove dependency on Guard.

1.32  Wed Dec  7 12:56:41 CET 2016
	- work around a bug in perl 5.20 (and probably later) where
          undef array elements become null pointers in the array.
          this caused segmentation faults on illegal/unsupported ASN.1
          types.

1.31  Thu Oct 23 17:57:44 CEST 2014
	- change dependency check to not include a version,
          as the Net::SNMP version number isn't monotonically increasing.

1.3   Thu Sep 18 04:51:17 CEST 2014
	- fix a potential leak.

1.2   Tue Jan 25 20:26:50 CET 2011
	- fix a bug where the internal message cache wouldn't be refreshed
          when perl reuses SVs, causing runtime errors and possibly crashes.
	- remove harmless/unused debugging code.

1.1   Thu Jul 29 04:50:46 CEST 2010
	- provide optimised _buffer_append/put - this should speed up
          message encoding and fixes a number of bugs in snmpv3 handling
          caused by this module.
	- fix illegal ASN.1 type handling in process_sv.
        - minor _buffer_get optimisations.

1.0   Wed May  5 22:36:27 CEST 2010
	- implement the last missing bit, which I forgot, and broke
          snmpv3.
        - use a slightly slower, but more robust way of fetching/storing
          the buffer state for the parser.

0.03  Sun Apr 12 02:48:00 CEST 2009
	- support leading_dot setting.
	- add xs replacement for oid_base_match.
	- add xs replacement for oid_lex_sort, _index_cmp (only with glibc).

0.02  Sat Apr 11 06:21:38 CEST 2009
	- first CPAN release.

0.01  Wed Apr  8 07:07:51 CEST 2009
	- original version; cloned from Convert::Scalar.
