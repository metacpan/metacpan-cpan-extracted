MySQL::DateFormat

This module provides an easy-to-use utility for converting dates
to and from MySQL and human-readable formats. It has built-in
error-checking and is highly customizable to fit your environment
(although it works out of the box).

This version requires Moose. Version 1.x is maintained for those who don't have Moose on their system.
