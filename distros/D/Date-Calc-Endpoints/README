DESCRIPTION
    Date::Calc::Endpoints calculates a start/end date based on a interval
    type, and a number of intervals from the current date. This is often
    required in running scheduled and ad-hoc reports using the same script,
    where the desired date range has the requirement of, "7 months ago", or,
    "5 weeks ago, running Tuesday to Monday".

    Three dates are returned for the given interval:

    *   First date of the interval

    *   First date of the next interval

    *   Last date of the interval

    Two "end" dates are returned for convenience, as a report using a
    date+time field may require a query from "2015-10-01 through
    2015-11-01", but the title of the report may be, "Output for 2015-10-01
    through 2015-10-31".

    Date ranges are calculated based on the following parameters:

    *   type - the basic time interval for the report [ YEAR | QUARTER |
        MONTH | WEEK | DAY ] - no default, must be specified

        Note: QUARTER calculates the ranges for (Jan-Mar / Apr-Jun / Jul-Sep
        / Oct-Dec)

    *   intervals - how many "units in the past" (eq, "4 months ago") -
        default = 1

    *   span - number of consecutive units (eq, "5 month window") - default
        = 1

    *   sliding_window - Applicable if span > 1. If sliding_window is set,
        each interval back will slide by one unit of type. If sliding window
        is not set, each interval back will slide by (span) units of type. -
        default = 0

    *   direction - If set to "-", each positive value for "intervals" goes
        further into the past, and each negative value for "intervals" goes
        further into the future. If set to "+", the opposite applies.

    *   start_day_of_week - For type = WEEK, the day which should be used as
        the first day of the week (SUNDAY, MONDAY, ...) - default = MONDAY

    *   start_day_of_month - For type = MONTH, the day which should be used
        as the start date of the month. Valid values are 1..28. Date::Calc
        is used for these calculations. If adding/subtracting months, and
        the day component of the start month is greater than the number of
        days in the resulting month (ex, "Feb 30"), Date::Calc extends the
        calculation into the following month ("Mar 2"). To prevent
        confusion, Date::Calc::Endpoints only supports start_dom of 1 to 28.

    *   start_month_of_year - For type = YEAR, the month which should be
        used as the first day of the year. Valid values are 1..12. This
        would be applicable for fiscal years, which do not always start with
        *January*.

    *   today_date - Overrides the current date, typically for
        development/test purposes.

    The current window (intervals = 0) contains the current date.

  Illustrations
    The following tables illustrate the effect of various values of
    direction, sliding window, and interval, assuming span = 2. Notice in
    each case, "interval=1" is one unit away from the one containing the
    current date (C).

METHODS
  new
    Object constructor. Parameters can be set here, or in get_dates, or by
    set_*param* methods.

    Arguments: *\%parameters*
        my ($start, $end, $last) = $dr->new(*\%parameters*);

    type => [ *YEAR | QUARTER | MONTH | WEEK | DAY* ]
        Interval type. No default value - must be specified.

    intervals => *n*
        Number of intervals to move back/forth from the current interval.
        Default = 1.

    span => *n*
        Number of *type* to include in the range. Default = 1.

    start_day_of_week => [ *MONDAY | TUESDAY | WEDNESDAY | ...* ]
        For *type = WEEK*, the day to denote the first day of the week.
        Default = MONDAY.

    start_day_of_month => [ *1, 2, 3...28* ]
        For *type = MONTH*, the day to denote the first day of the month.
        Default = 1.

    sliding_window => [ *O | 1* ]
        Applicable when span > 1. If *sliding_window=1*, each successive
        *intervals* results in a shift of *span* (years, months, etc). If
        *sliding_window=0*, each successive *intervals* results in a shift
        of one (year, month, etc). Default = 0.

    direction => [ *"+" | "-"* ]
        If *direction="-"*, *intervals* progresses further into the past. If
        *direction="+"*, *intervals* progresses further into the future.
        Default = "-".

  get_dates
    Main method. Returns *start_date*, *end_date*, and *last_date*.

    Arguments: *\%Parameters*
        my ($start, $end, $last) = $dr->get_dates(*\%parameters*);

        Any of the parameters set in *new* may be set/overridden here.

  Accessors
    Each of the parameters may be set/restrieved using set_*param* /
    get_*param* methods.

   set_intervals / get_intervals
    Interval type: [ *YEAR | QUARTER | MONTH | WEEK | DAY* ]. No default -
    must be specified.

   set_span / get_span
    Overrides the ranges running only one year/quarter/month/week/day at a
    time. Default = 1.

   set_start_day_of_week / get_start_day_of_week
    For weekly ranges, defines the starting day to be used for the week, [
    *MONDAY | TUESDAY | WEDNESDAY | ...* ]. Default = Monday.

   set_start_day_of_month / get_start_day_of_month
    For monthly ranges, defines the starting day to be used for the month.
    Only supported values are 1-28, as months with less than 31 days may
    yield results unexpected by the end user. Default = 1.

   set_start_month_of_year / get_start_month_of_year
    For yearly ranges, defiens the starting month to be used. The starting
    day is fixed at 1. Default = 1 (January)..

   set_today_date / get_today_date
    By default, the current date is used. This can be overridden, for
    development/test purposes. Format must be YYYY-MM-DD.

   set_sliding_window / get_sliding_window
    Applicable if span > 1. Determines whether successive intervals move an
    entire span, or just a single amount of type. For instance, if type =
    MONTH and span = 5, should each successive value of *intervals* advance
    one month at a time, or five months at a time. Default = 0 ("five months
    at a time").

   set_direction / get_direction
    The direction which successive intervals progresses. This allows for
    positive values of *interval*, whether looking into the past, or into
    the future. To get date ranges which are further into the past,
    recommend setting direction to "-". If date ranges in the future are
    required, recommend setting direction to "+". Default = "-". Refer to
    the Illustrations section for examples.

  get_error
    Retrieve any errors detected by the object.

  clear_error
    Reset the error stack

EXAMPLES
    Date is 2015-10-10, type = 'MONTH', direction = '-', span = 1. Such a
    setup would be used for running monthly reports.

    Intervals = 0 would be the current month:

        my $dr = Date::Calc::Endpoints->new(type => 'MONTH');
        my ($start, $end, $last) = $dr->get_dates(intervals => 0);
            (2015-10-01, 2015-11-01, 2015-10-31)

    Intervals = 4 would be four months prior to this:

        my $dr = Date::Calc::Endpoints->new(type => 'MONTH');
        my ($start, $end, $last) = $dr->get_dates(intervals => 4);
            (2015-06-01, 2015-07-01, 2015-06-30)

    If "intervals" is a negative number, ranges would be in the future
    (improbable, but supported):

        my $dr = Date::Calc::Endpoints->new(type => 'MONTH');
        my ($start, $end, $last) = $dr->get_dates(intervals => -1);
            (2015-11-01, 2015-12-01, 2015-11-30)

    Date is 2015-10-10, type = 'MONTH', direction = '-', span = 5. Sliding
    window now becomes relevant.

    Intervals = 1 should still be the most recent, completed period. If
    sliding_window = 0:

        my $dr = Date::Calc::Endpoints->new(type => 'MONTH', span => 5);
        my ($start, $end, $last) = $dr->get_dates(intervals => 1);
            (2015-05-01, 2015-10-01, 2015-09-30)

    Intervals = 0 will be the next period, starting with the current month:

        my $dr = Date::Calc::Endpoints->new(type => 'MONTH', span => 5);
        my ($start, $end, $last) = $dr->get_dates(intervals => 0);
            (2015-10-01, 2016-03-01, 2016-02-29)

    Now, if sliding window is enabled, intervals = 1 should still be the
    most recent, completed period:

        my $dr = Date::Calc::Endpoints->new(type => 'MONTH', span => 5, sliding_window => 1);
        my ($start, $end, $last) = $dr->get_dates(intervals => 1);
            (2015-05-01, 2015-10-01, 2015-09-30)

    This time, intervals = 0 will end with the current month:

        my $dr = Date::Calc::Endpoints->new(type => 'MONTH', span => 5, sliding_window => 1);
        my ($start, $end, $last) = $dr->get_dates(intervals => 0);
            (2015-06-01, 2015-11-01, 2015-10-31)

    All parameters can be set at instantiation, set distinctly, or passed in
    with get_dates.

        my $dr = Date::Calc::Endpoints->new(type => 'MONTH', intervals => 1);
        my ($start, $end, $last) = $dr->get_dates();
            (2015-09-01, 2015-10-01, 2015-09-30)

        $dr->set_intervals(2);
        my ($start, $end, $last) = $dr->get_dates();
            (2015-08-01, 2015-09-01, 2015-08-31)

        my ($start, $end, $last) = $dr->get_dates(intervals => 3);
            (2015-07-01, 2015-08-01, 2015-07-31)

DIAGNOSTICS
    Any errors detected may be retrieved via *$dr->get_errors*. Errors are
    accumulated as they are encountered. They are cleared only when
    *$dr-*clear_errors> is invoked.

LIMITATIONS
    *   The only allowed format for returned dates is 'YYYY-MM-DD'.

    *   "Start day-of-month" is only valid only for values 1-28. This was to
        avoid trying to use last-day-of-month, which becomes problematic for
        days with less than 31 days. Arguments could be made that, "one
        month after the last day of January" is Feb 28, or March 3, or even
        March 4 on a leap year.

        here, such as "3000 years ago".
