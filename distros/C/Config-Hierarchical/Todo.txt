User can add a default variable generator for unexisting variables

implement remaining tests (listed in 020.t)
	- test locking and inherited variables locking

Single Eval::Context perl Config::Set vs single Eval::Context for all the Set in a SetMultiple/Construction

Check if a history is implemented right when a variable exists in multiple categories
	what history is returned?
	
ADD name aliasing
	categories?

LOCK the whole config

get a md5 for the config 

set a mask for which variables can be accessed
	set mask	get mast => die if accesses
	inheriting object can set what it inherits
	object giving can list what is inheritable

remove variables => make them non acceessible with set/get but keep them

?? Remove debugging. Filter it out?
	use Debug::Mixin instead

log4j support


optionaly, show warning if variable withing the same category is assigned a different value

Shall Parents allow override instead for children forcing the override
	or shall we force an unlock and an override?
	or shall we add a die if override
	
Die if precedence given option
Die if override option (how does lock work in this case) 

Die if variable is not set when GetConfig is called
Die if variable not existst in GetConfig
	both the above could be implemented with a test passed after Get instead for an internal implementation
	
Add a cache to get the data quickly, IMPORTANT! it should generate the same warning and errors if any

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#check in git

# Add tests where the variable's value is a structure

#optionaly, keep variable access log. can be used for Xref.
	#log get
	log gethashref ??
	#access function to the log
	#document
	examples in cookbook

#EVAL instead for VALUE
	#EvalString (was called eval config in PBS)
	#does it have to be in config::hierarchical? => make it a plugin
	#check if Text::template is OK
	implement as : replace EVAL by VALUE in CheckSetArguments (log it too?)
	document

#change ALIAS to CONFIGURATION_ALIAS

#is order in CATEGORIES_TO_EXTRACT_FROM important

#Add Name checking => SET_SUB

#Invalid value for variable 'F'. Local validator
	should show the values
	
#have a white list/regex/callback to allow only certain variables to be set
	this will allow us to control what variables are added to the config

"takes precedence" warning can not be silenced, should itpossible?

# write a bunch of examples in a cookbook (take them from tests)
	particularly show the warning errors
	explain how to inherit from config to config
	give some use cases

# Can we set a lock to 0 without force lock?
	=> no
	
#Options/CATEGORIES_TO_EXTRACT_FROM put the warning info on a single
line. Same in GetHashRef.

#Error in GetCategories example

# History output has changed the action is before the value now

#Disable silent ...
        C::H will display warnings

#Missing blank line before FILE and LINE

#Replace 'You can override the aliased category variables.' by you can
STILL

#Options/ history: remove comment about how it could have been done


#GetMultiple: better variable names


#Delta: no identical filter example is weird

#document history compacter

#add comment, history force lock, override, lock,... to history event

#Config Delta

	in package Config::Hierarchical::Delta
	
	this can be used for showing what config have changed before running rules or to show
	the difference between a node and its package
	
	delta between lists in a config object

		$c->Delta
			(
			CATEGORIES => [],
			EXTERNAL_CONFIGS => [], #sense if they are C::H or other type. expect a hash access 
			CHECK_SUB => sub,
			DISPLAY_CALLBACK => sub,
			)
		
	delta between objects (with lists)
		=> can be done in two steps
		
	accept callback from caller 
		pass object to caller for introspection
		caller pass arguments to callback
		default callback is a dumper
			default dumper can also get arguments

	return a diff data structure that can be displayed by any dumper

#package Config::Hierarchical::Tie::ReadOnly
	same as GetHashref but the values are kept in the config object, usufull to save memory when doing EvalString

# GENERATE WARNING for ALIASED categories

#can we override a locked variable => yes, no warnings (except override)

!Add sub to initalize a category in one call. once initialized, it shall not be possible to initialize
	a category again.
	=> use INITIAL_VALUES
	
#Add sub to extract a config for user defined categories. the returned config should be directly usable
	to initialize another category
	
	my $config_1 = new Config::Hierarchical(.....) ;
	
	my $config_2 = new Config::Hierarchical
					(
					INITIAL_VALUES =>
						[
						config_1->GetAllVariableInInitializationFormat
							(
							CATEGORY => 'XYZ,
							LOCK => 1,
							HISTORY => undef # remove history
							),
						
						[CATEGORY => 'CLI', NAME => 'CC', VALUE => 1,],
						[CATEGORY => 'CLI', NAME => 'LD', VALUE => 2, LOCK => 1],
						],
					) ;


#It should be possible to implement a category through a reference to another C::H object
	this is nested configs. one solution is to implement a tied hash interface on top of C:.H
	for read only nested config, we cuold implement only exists and fetch in the tie. Maybe
	implementing two tied modules on top of C::H is the cleanest solution
	
	
	my $config_1 = new Config::Hierarchical(.....) ;
	my $config_2 = new Config::Hierarchical
					(
					.....
					REFERENCE_CONFIG =>
						[
							{
							CATEGORY_NAME => 
							CONFIGURATION_REFERENCE => $config_1,
							ALLOWED_VARIABLES => [], 
							LOCKED_CATEGORY =>
							HISTORY => ...
							...
							},
						]
					) ;
	This is not going to be time effective even if it save a lot of memory
		=> this decision should be left to the user

	
#Add sub to lock category, making the category read only

#Add validation
	can we define a validator for an already existing configuration variable, yes
	do we inherit validators, between what?
	Can a validator be used for cross variable dependency? preferably something added externally
	can we have multiple validators (good)
	does a new validator check for an already existing value? should
	Can we use the same mechanism for user validators and C::I validators (IE override ...)
	are validators per variable or per category? variable
	remember where validators are added

	We may want to define validators before we create a config

	GetConfig shall NOT return an invalid value if the validator was set after the value

	Set
		NAME ...
		VALIDATORS => [sub, ...]

	VALIDATORS =>
		[
		{
		CATEGORY_NAMES => ['CLI', 'CURRENT',] ,
		NAMES          => ['CC', 'LD'],
		VALIDATORS     => {alphanumeric => \&alphanumeric,},
		},
		],

#History should have its name (including where it was created (package, node sub, ...)) at the bottom to help read it
	can use comments
	
#Packages that do not modify a config variable shall not be in the previous history
	not part of this module as history is handled manually

# ----------------------------
# We need to be able to get a config's history accross packages.
	#This means we need to be able to link histories together. Possibily link
	config together.

	#A naive approach is to copy the history from parent to child. This will
	use memory but will guarantee isolation.

	#Setting history should only be allowed once before the variable is defined


#'precedence given to X::Y'  should be 'X::Y takes precedence'

#when a class override another:
	do we need to use override again next time?
	shall we display a warning if override is not set
	this is how it worked in 0.01
	=> force it to override
	
#variable history should be extracted accross the categories in the right order

#what happends when setting an overriden variable?
	#does it stay overriden? yes
	is a warning generated? yes


#Add option to warn if lower level config will be ignored
	IE: setting a local variable would display a warning about the non local variable
	CHECK_LOWER_LEVEL_CATEGORIES
	
#Warning when categories are used explicitely by the user
	setable through a sub 
	SetDisplayExplicitCategoryWarningOption
	WARN_FOR_EXPLICIT_CATEGORY

#Is category used in Get?
#Get should return where the config is comming from (GET_CATEGORY)
#Config category dump should be done in hierarchical order
#status message and displayed messages differ slightly. 
	#use the same variable
	#multiple lines are displayed when multiple higher priority entries are
		encountered, display a single header footer
# An empty history string is added when the value is identical
#Check number of element in all subs to avoid 'odd number of ...' message
# OK Do we need 'force lock' to unlock 
#OK Can we set a protected category variable?
#We should be able to add a comment to the history entry when setting a
	variable
#lock status is not added to history when locking is done through 'set'. 
	OK when	done through 'lock'
#typo in GetCategories example
#Do we keep a history of warnings (protected, ignored, ...) and should it be an option
