	  linked.

0.13  Fri Jun 13 2008

	- Get rid of the "require Win32" statement in Makefile.PL.

	- Add ABOVE_NORMAL_PRIORITY_CLASS and BELOW_NORMAL_PRIORITY_CLASS
	  constants (not exported by default).

	  the code doesn't warn on undef.

	  (Reini Urban <rurban@x-ray.at>)

	  used with the Wait() method. (Christopher Allan)

	  remove USING_WIDE() codepaths (Jan Dubois)
