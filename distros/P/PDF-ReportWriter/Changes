CHANGELOG

Version 1.5, released 10-Feb-2008

    Patches from Dietrich Streifert <dietrich.streifert@googlemail.com>
        A background coloring function similar to the colour_func
            implementation. Additionally the current cell rendering options should
            be passed to both rendering functions
        The possibility to set the aligment of the row header
        Documented above
    
    Fixed scaling image down if they're too big to fit on page
    Fixed more optimisations that were breaking rendering of blank lines ( \n )
    page_template() now supports being passed a path to a template file
        ( ie you can override the default template )
    Fixed off-by-one error in wrap_text
    Completed multi-line row support
        ( ie 'row' definitions can spill over 100% of x-space, in effect
          covering >1 rows )
    Added text justification support ( and documented )
        ( set 'align' property to 'justified' )
    Fixed clobbering of a cell's text_whitespace property

Version 1.4, released 01-Jul-2007

    Patches from Cosimo Streppone <cosimo@cpan.org>:
        Improved management of image files according to underlying PDF::API2
            installed version. If you specify an image type that PDF::API2
            can't handle, the image is skipped and a warning is produced.
        Fixed and documented custom cell type mechanism, and added automatic
            require of formatter classes.
    
    Patches Patrik Eschle <patrik.eschle@spectraseis.com>:
        Added support for code39 barcodes
    
    Fixed rendering of the character 0 by itself
    Fixed setup of group footer definition if aggregate source is cell 0
    Fixed bad calling of calculate_y_needed
        ( was passing 'fields' in the options hash instead of 'cells' )
    Added support for multi-line text in data ( ie cells can expand vertically )
    Fixed printing of data headers if there are no groups defined
    Fixed x_pos of text in render_cell_text() for multiline text
    Moved execution of custom render functions to happen before rendering all other cell types
    Added return hash for custom render functions, with support for passing stuff back for traditional rendering
    Added fetch_group_results() function ( use this with custom_render_func )
    Fixed splitting of columns inside a delimited group value for group headers ( sorry Bill )
    Fixed printing of group headers if we have to reset them while we're calculating whether we need a new page
    INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE:
        colour_func() functions now get passed ( $value, $row ) instead of just $row
    Removed dependancy on Number::Format
    Fixed rendering of footers if reprinting_header is on
    Fixed corruption of group aggregate values in some cases
    Added text wrapping option to cells for text that is wider than the current width
    Added option to cells to strip line breaks from text
    Fixed bug in calculate_y_space for non-data cells ( eg where $cell->{text} is rendered )
    Create a new page before the 1st invocation of calculate_y_space so we have a text object
    Improved numeric and currency formatting - see the cell's new 'format' key
    Fixed rendering of cell where text begins with a space ( bad optimisation )
    
Version 1.3, released 31-Mar-2006
    Patches from Cosimo Streppone <cosimo@cpan.org>:
        Fixed out-of-memory errors when defining cells that exceed page height.
        Many fixes about text and barcode cells alignment of content even when
            using absolute x, y coordinates.
        Refactored cell font object retrieving code, to be used both in barcode
            and text cells.
        Added and documented more barcode properties (upper/lower mending zones,
            custom font/font_size)
        Added current_page() method to retrieve PDF::API2::Page underlying object
            where we are rendering content. One can choose to draw directly on that.
        Added another example of barcode document (PDF as a barcode label)
        Added page duplication example (cool!)
  
Version 1.2, released 26-Mar-2006
    Patches from Cosimo Streppone <cosimo@cpan.org>:
        Added "one-step" loading and rendering of reports from external XML files.
            XML::Simple now is a pre-requisite for PDF::ReportWriter.
        Added data sources definition in the xml report, with a basic DBI data-source
            plugin already available. Invented a new syntax for text cells to refer to
            external data sources (`%datasource_name[record_no,column_no]%').
        Added an examples folder with some basic cool xml reports.
        Added print() method to directly print pdf reports to CUPS print queues.
        Added saveas() method just like PDF::API2 class.
        Added `max', `min' aggregate functions.
        Added basic handling of multi-line text on text cells, with proper
            calculation of cell height.
        Added ReportWriter->stringify() method that returns all the pdf document
            in a scalar, useful when you want to stream your document to a browser.
        Refactored the cell text processing code in new `get_cell_text()' method.
            Now every part of report should have macro expansion (%PAGE%, ...).
        Now the `field_headers_upper_buffer' works as advertised.
        Now document info->Creator field can be overridden.
        [EXPERIMENTAL] New cell type "custom:xxxx" to allow arbitrary formatting.
        Various fixes with barcode cells rendering (code 39 and 128).
        Minor optimizations around the group aggregate calculation.
        Documentation updates.
    Many thanks Cosimo :)
    
    Added support for image types: tiff, gif, pnm

Version 1.0, released 11-Mar-2006
    Patches from Cosimo Streppone:
        Added rendering of absolute-positioned cells with x,y properties.
        Added rendering of barcodes of type 39 and 128.
        Added support for PDF template pages.
        Some refactoring of code at the cell/row rendering level.
        Added basic testing of module.
        Various optimisations.
        Documentation updates.
    Many thanks Cosimo for the above work :)
    
    Added 'thousands_separated' type - similar to currency type, but no dollar sign in front
    Added 'buffer' key to image definition - minimum whitespace around an image ( defaults to 1 )
    Changed $cell->{border_width} to $cell->{full_width}. 'border_width' is a very bad description ...
    Added field_headers object and cleaned up mess of code that previously existed to deal with headers
    Code cleanup: renamed remaining $field variables to $cell
    Added warnings on image issues:
        - Can't detect image dimensions ( including image not found )
        - Unknown image type
    Added 'bold' key to cell definition ( and support legacy behaviour )
    Store temporary image metadata inside cell's image hash instead of passing it round
        This adds support for rendering > 1 image per row :)
    Automatically set the data_column for the GrandTotals group so you don't need to specify it
    Optimisation: Cache image data ( dimensions, type ) in the image hash
    Added support for custom rendering functions ( ie direct use of PDF::API2 ) for each cell
        *Please* consider submitting useful functions for inclusion into PDF::ReportWriter :)
    Fixed initial rendering of field headers if there are no groups defined
    Fixed bad calling of calculate_y_needed ( changed 'fields' key to 'cells' in options hash )
    Fixed error on multiple render() invocations with images ( cache being destroyed )
    
Version 0.9, released 16-Jan-2006
    Patches from Bill Hess:
        Added support for defining Top, Bottom, Left, Right cell borders to render
        Added support for splitting multiple columns of data into a group header
    Many thanks to Bill for the above work :)
    
    Fixed calculation of $field->{text_width} ( take into account user-defined text_whitespace )
    Replaced max_font_size with max_cell_height - better way of handling Y-space
    Incorporated groups into setup_cell_definitions()
    Changed $field in setup_cell_definitions() to $cell
    Added support for reprinting group headers on a new page
    Fixed error in rendering final group footers if there is no footer defined. How did this happen?
    Added upper_buffer and lower_buffer keys to group & data definitions for defining whitespace buffers
    Added support for page breaking before a group header
    Reprint higher-level 'reprinting_header' group headers when a lower-level group triggers a page break
    Broke out queuing group headers into separate assemble_group_header_queue() method
    Removed $no_group_footer variable
    Calculate size of group header queue, and if too big, re-assemble entire queue based on assumption that
        we're printing on a new page ( which could pull in more group headers that are reprinting_headers )
        - thanks for Bill Hess for tirelessly reporting this bug until I fixed it :)
    Added support for dynamic images - image path comes from the data array
    Updated TODO with final feature additions for a 1.0 release, and plans for 2.0
    
Version 0.81, released 22-Oct-2005
    
    Fixed stoopid mistake ( missing bracket close ) in previous release
    
Version 0.8, released 22-Oct-2005
    
    Added page headers and footers, dealt with in same style as data ( ie an array of cells )
    Added special tags %PAGE%, %PAGES%, and %TIME% for page headers and footers
    Added cell-level control of cell borders, including colour support
    Added legacy page footers ( default if no page footer specified )
    Added support for setting PDF info
    Don't create a new page in the constuctor - wait until we get passed some data
    Added setup_cell_definitions() to generically fill out details of all different types of cells
    Broke out calculation of Y needed into calculate_y_needed()
    Fixed typo in paper setup ( 'portait' should be 'portrait' ) - thanks to Bill Hess for spotting this one
    Added 'bsize' and 'legal' paper sizes - thanks to Bill Hess for these additions
    Removed all global variables
    Updated documentation & cleaned up POD somewhat
    
Version 0.7, released 22-Aug-2005
    
    Move down before rendering instead of after in group_header ( and not in GrandTotals header )
    Fixed small bug in calculation of Y-space needed for current data block
        ( take into account whitespace between previous row and group header )
    
Version 0.6, released 02-Aug-2005
    
    Major, major rewrite. Many new features. Squashed all bugs I know of.
    Fixed bug in resetting aggregate fields when entering a new group
    Fixed bug in colour_func when called on non-data stuff ( eg headers, footers, etc )
    Better comments in source, use constants for TRUE / FALSE
    Replaced $field->{picture} with $field->{image} hash
    Set $self->{default_font_size} to 12 if one isn't supplied
    Renamed internal variables for more consistancy
    Replaced $cell_spacing with dynamic calculation of $field->{text_whitespace} ( user can define own values )
    Replaced user-defined $self->{data}->{max_font_size} with calculated value - any max_font_size value you set will be overriden
    Added far more robust calculation of Y-space needed for current block of data
    Keep group headings with data ( ie don't print a group header at the bottom of a page ) ... FIGJAM
    Move down the page immediately *before* rendering each line, instead of after
    Added image scaling ... that actually works ( added dependancy on Image::Size )
    Added image alignment
    Recognise "center" as well as "centre" in alignment definition
    Get rid of warnings about unintialised variables ( 'no warnings' directive )
    Added support for colour background setting for cells - current options are 'box' or 'ellipse'
    Separated demo app from main package
    
Version 0.5, released 15-Jun-2005
    
    Added support for images - scaled to fit to the current cell ( not finalised - comments welcome )
    Support multiple 'render_data' operations - you can keep passing new data ( or new groups / fields / data )
    Added support for colour
    Added support colour_func - a user-defined function to set the colour based on the current data
    
Version 0.4, released 09-May-2005
    
    Check for group footer definitions in final run before actually calling group_footer() on them
    Added currency:no_fill field type ... if you don't want your amounts filled out to 2 decimal places
    Remove requirement of setting the 'text' key to the group name for aggregate results in group footers
    
Version 0.3, released 08-May-2005
    
    Bold & Centre field headers
    Fixed bug in page counting that would 'remember' ( somehow ) the page count from previous reports
    Do page footers in a separate pass when saving so we can write 'Page N of M' instead of just 'Page N'

Version 0.2, released 27-Apr-2005
    
    Fixed bug in group handling that was preventing the special 'GrandTotal' group header from being rendered
    Added a much-requested demo application
    
Version 0.1, released 26-Apr-2005

    First Version :)
    Table-based text layout engine with cell borders
    Text alignment inside cells
    Basic aggregate commands ( sum, count )
    Page headers / footers
    Group headers / footers ( unlimited )
    POD documentation
