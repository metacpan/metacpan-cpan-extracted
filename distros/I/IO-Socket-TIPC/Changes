Revision history for Perl extension IO::Socket::TIPC.

1.08 Wed Mar 26 05:09:33 PDT 2008
	- fix testsuite's Test::Exception detection (again)

1.07 Tue Mar 25 06:39:12 PDT 2008
	- support the Solaris TIPC stack, thanks to Renaud Metrich
	- update documentation accordingly
	- add a ->detect() method with some OS-specific runtime checks
	- resolve some weird test failures regarding "use_ok" in Test::Simple 0.78

1.06 Mon Jul 17 11:15:35 PDT 2006
	- 03_socket.t skips if kernel doesn't support TIPC.  (The other tests
	  already checked this.)

1.05 Tue Jun 27 08:42:00 PDT 2006
	- add missing (but documented) waitfor.pl example script

1.04 Tue May 16 14:27:00 PDT 2006
	- Document the fact that ->recvfrom() only requires one argument.
	- Document the fact that ->getsockopt() and ->setsockopt() are really
	  just the perl builtins, and point to perlfunc.
	- Minor POD highlighting changes.

1.03 Tue May 10 13:56:00 PDT 2006
	- Now that Programmers_Guide.txt is on the TIPC website, remove the local
	  copy, link to the official one.

1.02 Tue May  9 10:35:10 PDT 2006
	- Changes file should be in reverse order, newest first.
	- Oops, the SYNOPSIS was wrong in the manpage.  Fix it.

1.01 Tue Apr 25 18:04:40 PDT 2006
	- Complete examples/multicast_msg, add a waitfor.pl.
	- ->recvfrom()'s length argument now defaults to TIPC_MAX_USER_MSG_SIZE.

1.00 Sun Apr 23 20:15:20 PDT 2006
	- add documentation for getsockopt/setsockopt, and the TIPC specific flags.
	- add ->new() fields to set TIPC_IMPORTANCE and TIPC_CONN_TIMEOUT before
	  bind/connect.
	- remove dependency on Switch.pm.  That seems to have sped things up 300%.
	- add a multicast example.  Organize examples/.  Document them properly.
	- tempt fate, release 1.0 - I'm out of features to add, time to fix bugs.

0.11 Sun Apr 23 10:00:35 PDT 2006
	- change my XS POD into #-style comments... I don't really want my ugly
	  internals listed as "Documentation" on cpan.org.
	- Sockaddr.pm: fix the ->set_* functions.  
	- implement ->getpeername() and ->getsockname().
	- export tipc_addr, tipc_zone, tipc_cluster, tipc_node functions.
	- the documentation should now be complete.

0.10  Sat Apr 22 12:37:25 PDT 2006
	- Add accessor methods for all of the individual Sockaddr fields.
	- Sockaddr.pm class instances don't really need to be huge hash references,
	  just a reference to the raw sockaddr_tipc data is fine.  This simplifies
	  things quite a bit, and speeds it up a little too.
	- Add an ugly, spammy, memory-leak test for the XS stuff.  It passes.
	- Run tests in a non-random order.

0.04  Fri Apr 21 09:10:00 PDT 2006
	- Allan Stephens reported a couple of missing constants.  I went and
	  grabbed a copy of tipc-1.5.10, its TIPC is missing PF_TIPC, TIPC_CFG_SRV,
	  TIPC_TOP_SRV and TIPC_RESERVED_NODES.
	  In the interests of maximum portability, I'm making missing constants a
	  nonfatal error; the constant just returns 'undef' if it wasn't defined in
	  tipc.h.  Also, PF_TIPC is rather important, so I've conditionally defined
	  it to AF_TIPC in TIPC.xs when found to be undefined.  (linux-2.6.16's
	  tipc.h defines it the same way.)
	- Added an extra set of tests, to ensure useful return values from those
	  constants the TIPC module uses internally.  (Currently, a very small
	  subset of the full list.)
	- The socket(2) manpage indicates its first field should be a PF_* value,
	  not AF_*.  Switch TIPC.pm to use PF_TIPC.
	- Fix Sockaddr's _stringify() XS method, to print everything as unsigned
	  integers.  This is rather important; portid references are 32-bit and
	  they seem to be randomly generated, so the high bit is set half of the
	  time.

0.03  Fri Apr 21 06:17:00 PDT 2006
	- Tested the module with 5.6.2 successfully.  Lower required version in
	  Makefile.PL, accordingly.  perl-5.6.0 failed to build (some Makefile
	  problem), so I was unable to test TIPC against that version.
	- Rework the Makefile.PL stuff that attempts to find tipc.h.  Work with a
	  tipc.h file from either linux kernel sources, or from the tipc addon
	  sources.
	- As a useful side effect of the above, tell CPANPLUS not to report build
	  failures if the prerequisites aren't met (OS = Linux, can find tipc.h).
	- Implement sendto() and recvfrom().  These are still a bit hackish at the
	  moment, but I can fix that without changing the API.
	- Write tests for SOCK_RDM and SOCK_DGRAM.  Update the testsuite to always
	  call things in the right order, rather than relying on sleep(1) to avoid
	  race conditions.  This speeds "make test" up by 5 seconds or more.
	- Adjust t/sockaddr.t to skip the throws_ok() tests, when the user doesn't
	  have Test::Exception installed.  Since we run without it, remove it from
	  the list of dependencies.
	- Release 0.03.

0.02  Thu Apr 20 13:15:23 PDT 2006
	- minor POD fix.
	- tell CPANPLUS (and everyone else) that we only support Linux (for now).

0.01  Thu Apr 20 09:34:45 PDT 2006
	- First release.  Supports SOCK_STREAM and SOCK_DGRAM.
