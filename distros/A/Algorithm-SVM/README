Algorithm::SVM was originally written by Cory Spencer of the Simon Fraser
University Brinkman Laboratory and provides Perl bindings for a Support 
Vector Machine.  It is currently maintained by Matthew Laird and all
inquiries, patches and comments should be sent to him.

Algorithm::SVM is based on the libsvm library written by Chih-Chung Chang
and Chih-Jen Lin.

To read about the latest features, see the Changes file.

The author invites feedback on SVM. If you find a bug, please send the

installed.


4) BUGS
-------

If you find a bug, please report it to the author along with the
following information:

    * version of Perl (output of 'perl -V' is best)
    * version of Algorithm::SVM
    * operating system type and version
    * exact text of error message or description of problem
    * example model files/data being classified

If we don't have access to a system similar to yours, you may be asked
to insert some debugging lines and report back on the results.
The more help and information you can provide, the better.
