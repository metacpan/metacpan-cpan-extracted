Linux::Prctl -- Control process attributes through prctl
========================================================

The linux prctl function allows you to control specific characteristics of a
process' behaviour. Usage of the function is fairly messy though, due to
limitations in C and linux. This module provides a nice non-messy interface.

Besides prctl, this library also wraps libcap for complete capability handling.

INSTALLATION

You can download the latest code from http://github.com/seveas/Linux-Prctl

To install this module type the following:

   (Some tests need root privileges, run 'sudo make test' if you trust me)
   make install

DEPENDENCIES
