NAME
    HTTP::Response::Stringable - Makes HTTP::Response objects stringable

VERSION
    version 0.0002

SYNOPSIS
        my $res = LWP::UserAgent->new->get('http://example.com');
        Role::Tiny->apply_roles_to_object($res, 'HTTP::Response::Stringable');
        print "$res";

DESCRIPTION
    This module is a role that can be applied to HTTP::Response objects to
    make them stringable.

    After applying this role to the response object, you can use it in
    string context. The resulting string is simply the return value of the
    HTTP::Response "as_string" method.

    My motivation for creating this module was that I wanted to throw
    "HTTP::Response" objects as exceptions, and exception objects should
    have a string representation so that they can be properly logged. Here
    is an example use case:

        package WidgetFactory;
        use Moo;
        use LWP::UserAgent;

        sub create_widget {
            my $res = LWP::UserAgent->new->post('http://widget-factory/widgets');
            if (not $res->is_success) {
                require Role::Tiny;
                Role::Tiny->apply_roles_to_object($res, 'HTTP::Response::Stringable');
                die $res;
            }
        }

        # ...

        package main;
        use WidgetFactory;
        use TryCatch;

        my $wf = WidgetFactory->new;
        try {
            $wf->create_widget();
        } catch (HTTP::Response $res) {
            debug "Creating widget failed: $res";
        }
