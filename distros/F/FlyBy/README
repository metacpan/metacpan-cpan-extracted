NAME

    FlyBy - Ad hoc denormalized querying

SYNOPSIS

      use FlyBy;
    
      my $fb = FlyBy->new;
      $fb->add_records({array => 'of'}, {hash => 'references'}, {with => 'fields'});
      my @array_of_hash_refs = $fb->query({'key' => ['value', 'other value']});
    
      # Or with a 'reduction list':
      my @array = $fb->query({'key' => 'value'}, ['some key']);
      my @array_of_array_refs = $fb->query({'key' =>'value', 'other key' => 'other value'},
        ['some key', 'some other key']);

DESCRIPTION

    FlyBy is a system to allow for ad hoc querying of data which may not
    exist in a traditional datastore at runtime

USAGE

    add_records

        $fb->add_records({array => 'of'}, {hash => 'references'}, {with => 'fields'});

      Supply one or more hash references to be added to the store.

      Keys with undefined values will be silently stripped from each
      record. If the record is then empty it will be discarded.

      `croak` on error; returns `1` on success

    query

      string

          $fb->query("'type' IS 'shark' AND 'food' IS 'seal' -> 'called', 'lives_in'");

	The query parameters are joined with `IS` for equality testing, or
	`IS NOT` for its inverse.

	Multiple values for a given key can be combined with `OR`.

	Multiple keys are joined with AND.

	The optional reductions are prefaced with `->`.

	If no reduction is provided a list of the full record hash
	references is returned. If a reduction list of length 1 is
	provided, a list of the distinct values for the matching key is
	returned. If a longer reduction list is provided, a list of
	distinct value array references (in the provided key order) is
	returned.

      raw

          $fb->query({'type' => 'shark', 'food' => 'seal'}, ['called', 'lives_in']");

	The query clause is supplied as hash reference of keys and values
	to be `AND`-ed together for the final result.

	An array reference value is treated as a sucession of 'or'-ed
	values for the provided key.

	All values prepended with an `!` are deemed to be a negation of the
	rest of the string as a value.

	A second optional reduction list of strings may be provided which
	reduces the result as above.

      Will `croak` on improperly supplied query formats.

    all_keys

      Returns an array with all known keys against which one might query.

    values_for_key

      Returns an array of all known values for a given key.

CAVEATS

    Note that supplied keys may not begin with an `!`. Thought has been
    given to making this configurable at creation, but it was deemed to be
    unnecessary complexity.

    This software is in an early state. The internal representation and
    external API are subject to deep breaking change.

    This software is not tuned for efficiency. If it is not being used to
    resolve many queries on each instance or if the data is available from
    a single canonical source, there are likely better solutions available
    in CPAN.
