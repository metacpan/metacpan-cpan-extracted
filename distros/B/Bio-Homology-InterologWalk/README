DEPENDENCIES-------------------------------------------------------------------------

This module requires the following modules and libraries:

===============
1.  Ensembl API
===============
    
The Ensembl project is currently branched in two sub-projects:

    The Ensembl Vertebrates project
        This is of interest to you if you work with vertebrate genomes
        (although it also includes data from a few non-vertebrate common
        model organisms). See http://www.ensembl.org/index.html for further
        details.

    The Ensembl Genomes project
	This utilises the Ensembl software infrastructure (originally 
	developed in the Ensembl Core project) to provide access to 
	genome-scale data from non-vertebrate species. This is of interest 
	to you if your species is a non-vertebrate, or if your species is a 
	vertebrate but you also want to obtain results mapped from 
	non-vertebrates. Bio::Homology::InterologWalk at the moment officially 
	supports the metazoa sub-site from the Ensembl Genomes Project (note 
	that fungi, plants, protists might work however functionality has 
	not been tested thoroughly). See http://metazoa.ensembl.org/index.html 
	for further details.


    Please obtain the APIs and set up the environment by following the steps 
    described on the Ensembl Vertebrates API installation pages:

    http://www.ensembl.org/info/docs/api/api_installation.html

    or alternatively

    http://www.ensembl.org/info/docs/api/api_cvs.html

    NOTE 1 - The Ensembl Vertebrate and Ensembl Genomes DB releases are usually
             not synchronised: an Ensembl Genomes DB release usually follows the 
             corresponding Ensembl Vertebrates release by a number	of weeks. This means 
             that if you install a bleeding-edge Ensembl Vertebrate API, while the 
             corresponding Ensembl Vertebrate DB will exist, a matching EnsemblGenomes DB 
             release might not be available yet: you will still be able to use 
             Bio::Homology::InterologWalk to run an orthology walk using exclusively Ensembl 
             Vertebrate DBs, but you will get an error if you try to choose an Ensembl Genomes
             databases. In such cases, please install the most recent API compatible with
             Ensembl Genomes Metazoa, from

             http://metazoa.ensembl.org/info/docs/api/api_installation.html

             or alternatively

             http://metazoa.ensembl.org/info/docs/api/api_cvs.html

             This option will not always use the most recent data, but will guarantee 
             functionality across both Vertebrate and Metazoan genomes.

    NOTE 2 - All the API components (ensembl, ensembl-compara, ensembl-variation, 
             ensembl-functgenomics) must be installed.

    NOTE 3 - The module has been tested on Ensembl Vertebrates API & DB v. 59-64 
             and EnsemblGenomes API & DB v. 6-10.

==========
2. Bioperl
==========

    Ensembl provides a customised Bioperl installation tailored to its
    API, v. 1.2.3

    http://www.ensembl.org/info/docs/api/api_installation.html

    Should version 1.2.3 be no more available through
    Ensembl, please obtain release 1.6.x from CPAN. (while not officially
    supported by the Ensembl Project it will work fine when using the API
    within the scope of the present module).

EXAMPLE==========================================
e.g. to install API V.64, do the following:

log into the Ensembl CVS server at Sanger (using password: CVSUSER):

$ cvs -d :pserver:cvsuser@cvs.sanger.ac.uk:/cvsroot/ensembl login
Logging in to :pserver:cvsuser@cvs.sanger.ac.uk:2401/cvsroot/ensembl
CVS password: CVSUSER
Install the Ensembl Core Perl API for version 64

$ cvs -d :pserver:cvsuser@cvs.sanger.ac.uk:/cvsroot/ensembl checkout -r branch-ensembl-64 ensembl

=====================
3. EXTRA PERL MODULES
=====================
You will also need to install the following modules (including all dependencies) from CPAN:

1. REST::Client
2. GO::Parser
3. DBD::CSV (requires Perl DBI)
4. String::Approx
5. List::Util
6. File::Glob

The following modules are only required if you intend to compute conservation scores for the 
putative PPIs retrieved:
7.  Graph
8.  Data::PowerSet
9.  URI::Escape
10. Algorithm::Combinatorics

=====================
4. NOTE FOR MAC USERS
=====================
Please notice that Ensembl REQUIRES the module DBD::MySQL in order to work.
DBD::MySQL in turn will need to contact a running instance of MySQL in 
order to successfully complete the "make test" stage. Please check
http://www.ensembl.org/info/docs/api/api_installation.html
for further information. 

SAMPLE SCRIPS--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The scripts/Code sub-directory provide an example for the usage of 
the module. The meaning of the files is as follows:

-doInterologWalk.pl:  example usage of the core methods: given a flat file containing a list of stable Ensembl mouse IDs, this script will use Bio::Homology::InterologWalk to build a TSV file containing the putative interactors of such ids according to the interolog mapping method.

-getDirectInteractions.pl:  generate a dataset of direct PPIs based on the input ID list

-doScores.pl:  given a tsv obtained with doInterologWalk.pl, this file will compute a prioritisation index for each (id, putative interactor) couple, aggregating the available biological metadata for the interaction. The output of this script is a new TSV file containing a new prioritisation index column
                            
REQUIRES: doInterologWalk.pl getDirectInteractions.pl

-doNets.pl:    given a tsv obtained from doFlyWalk.pl (optionally, processed by doScores.pl to add a compound score column) this script will produce a .sif network file and two .noa network attribute files, suitable for importing into the Cytoscape (http://www.cytoscape.org/) network visualisation program. The files follow the definition on page http://cytoscape.org/cgi-bin/moin.cgi/Cytoscape_User_Manual/Network_Formats and have been tested on Cytoscape v. 2.6.2 - 2.8.2

REQUIRES: doInterologWalk.pl
OPTIONAL: doScores.pl

scripts/Data      contains a psi-mi obo ontology (used by doScores.pl interaction types and 
                  interaction detection methods) and a small sample Mus musculus dataset.
