NAME

    Win32::Getppid - Implementation of getppid() for windows

VERSION

    version 0.05

SYNOPSIS

     use Win32::Getppid;
     
     my $parent_pid = getppid;

DESCRIPTION

    This module simply provides an implementation of getppid for Windows,
    where it is usually missing. It doesn't do anything on non-Windows
    platforms, so you can safely make it a non-OS specific dependency for
    your CPAN module.

FUNCTIONS

 getppid

    Returns the parent process id for the current process. This is imported
    by default only in a real Windows environment ($^O eq 'MSWin32'). On
    Cygwin getppid returns the cygwin parent process, for the real windows
    parent process id on cygwin you can use the fully qualified version:

     my $windows_ppid = Win32::Getppid::getppid();
