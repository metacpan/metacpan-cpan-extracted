XAS is Copyright (c) 2012-2017 Kevin L. Esteb 

XAS is a set of modules, procedures and practices to help write
consistent Perl5 code for a datacenter operations environment. For the most 
part, this follows the Unix tradition of small discrete components that
communicate in well defined ways.

This system is cross platform capable. It will run under Windows as well
as Unix like environments without a code rewrite. This allows you to
write your code once and run it where ever.

This code is based on a production system that has been running for over
10 years. It incorporates the accumulated knowledge of running a
distributed system, written in Perl5.

Using standard Perl5 tools, this software can installed as follows:

 # perl Build.PL
 # ./Build
 # ./Build test
 # ./Build install
 # ./Build post_install
 
You may have to install additonal dependences. You can do this step.

 # ./Build installdeps
