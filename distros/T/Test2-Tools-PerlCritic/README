NAME

    Test2::Tools::PerlCritic - Testing tools to enforce Perl::Critic
    policies

VERSION

    version 0.07

SYNOPSIS

    Original procedural interface:

     use Test2::V0;
     use Test2::Tools::PerlCritic;
     
     perl_critic_ok ['lib','t'], 'test library files';
     
     done_testing;

    New OO interface:

     use Test2::V0;
     use Test2::Tools::PerlCritic ();
     use Perl::Critic;
     
     my $test_critic = Test2::Tools::PerlCritic->new({
       files     => ['lib','t'],
       test_name => 'test library_files',
     });
     
     $test_critic->perl_critic_ok;
     
     done_testing;

DESCRIPTION

    Test for Perl::Critic violations using Test2. Although this testing
    tool uses the Test2 API instead of the older Test::Builder API, the
    primary motivation is to provide output in a more useful form. That is
    policy violations are grouped by policy class, and the policy class
    name is clearly displayed as a diagnostic. The author finds the former
    more useful because he tends to address one type of violation at a
    time. The author finds the latter more useful because he tends to want
    to lookup or adjust the configuration of the policy as he is addressing
    violations.

FUNCTIONS

 perl_critic_ok

     perl_critic_ok $path, \@options, $test_name;
     perl_critic_ok \@path, \@options, $test_name;
     perl_critic_ok $path, \%options, $test_name;
     perl_critic_ok \@path, \%options, $test_name;
     perl_critic_ok $path, $critic, $test_name;
     perl_critic_ok \@path, $critic, $test_name;
     perl_critic_ok $path, $test_name;
     perl_critic_ok \@path, $test_name;
     perl_critic_ok $path;
     perl_critic_ok \@path;

    Run Perl::Critic on the given files or directories. The first argument
    ($path or \@path) can be either the path to a file or directory, or a
    array reference to a list of paths to files and directories. If
    \@options or \%options are provided, then they will be passed into the
    Perl::Critic constructor. If $critic (an instance of Perl::Critic) is
    provided, then that Perl::Critic instance will be used instead of
    creating one internally. Finally the $test_name may be provided if you
    do not like the default test name.

    Only a single test is run regardless of how many files are processed.
    this is so that the policy violations can be grouped by policy class
    across multiple files.

    As a convenience, if the test passes then a true value is returned.
    Otherwise a false will be returned.

    done_testing or the equivalent is NOT called by this function. You are
    responsible for calling that yourself.

    Since we do not automatically call done_testing, you can call
    perl_critic_ok multiple times, but keep in mind that the policy
    violations will only be grouped in each individual call, so it is
    probably better to provide a list of paths, rather than make multiple
    calls.

CONSTRUCTOR

     my $test_critic = Test2::Tools::PerlCritic->new(\%properties);

    Properties:

    files

      (REQUIRED)

      List of files or directories. Directories will be recursively
      searched for Perl files (.pm, .pl and .t).

    critic

      The Perl::Critic instance. One will be created if not provided.

    test_name

      The name of the test. This is used in diagnostics.

METHODS

 perl_critic_ok

     $test_critic->perl_critic_ok;

    The method version works just like the functional version above, except
    it doesn't take any additional arguments.

 add_hook

     $test_critic->add_hook($hook_name, \&code);

    Adds the given hook. Available hooks:

    cleanup

       $test_critic->add_hook(cleanup => sub ($test_critic, $global) {
         ...
       });

      This hook is called when the Test2::Tools::PerlCritic instance is
      destroyed.

      If the hook is called during global destruction of the Perl
      interpreter, $global will be set to a true value.

      This hook can be set multiple times.

    progressive_check

       $test_critic->add_hook(progressive_check => sub ($test_critic, $policy, $file, $count) {
         ...
         return $bool;
       });

      This hook is made available for violations in existing code when new
      policies are added. Passed in are the Test2::Tools::PerlCritic
      instance, the policy name, the filename and the number of times the
      violation was found. If the violations are from an old code base with
      grandfathered allowed violations, this hook should return true, and
      the violation will be reported as a note instead of diag and will not
      cause the test as a whole to fail. Otherwise the violation will be
      reported using diag and the test as a whole will fail.

      This hook can only be set once.

    violations

       $test_critic->add_hook(violations => sub ($test_critic, @violations) {
         ...
       });

      Each time violations are returned from "critique" in Perl::Critic,
      they are passed into this hook as a list. The order and grouping of
      violations may change in the future.

CAVEATS

    Test::Perl::Critic has been around longer, and probably does at least
    some things smarter. The fact that this module groups policy violations
    for all files by class means that it has to store more diagnostics in
    memory before sending them out en masse, where as Test::Perl::Critic
    sends violations for each file as it processes them. Test::Perl::Critic
    also comes with some code to optionally do processing in parallel. Some
    of these issues may or may not be addressed in future versions of this
    module.

    Since this module formats it's output the -verbose option is ignored at
    the set_format value is ignored.
