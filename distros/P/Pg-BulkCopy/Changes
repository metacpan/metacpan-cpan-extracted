Revision history for Pg-BulkCopy

0.22    21 July 2015 Deprecated.
0.20    8 October 2012
	Switched Testing Config File format to Config::General.
	Switched tests to DBIx::Simple to eliminate dependency
	on depracated dbi wrapper.
0.17	February 2011
	Changed to Log::Handler instead of my own sloppy log manipulations.
	Debugging of Carp::Heavy errors. 
	My research indicates that Carp::Heavy hits an ancient Perl Bug that can't be fixed
	without breaking lots of other things, so instead of telling me something useful about
	a problem it just dies. Unfortunately Carp::Heavy is inherited. Experimentiation 
	indicates that undefined values are often at fault for triggering it.
