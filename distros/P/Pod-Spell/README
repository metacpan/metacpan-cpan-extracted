NAME

    Pod::Spell - a formatter for spellchecking Pod

VERSION

    version 1.20

SYNOPSIS

            use Pod::Spell;
            Pod::Spell->new->parse_from_file( 'File.pm' );
    
            Pod::Spell->new->parse_from_filehandle( $infile, $outfile );

    Also look at podspell

            % perl -MPod::Spell -e "Pod::Spell->new->parse_from_file(shift)" Thing.pm |spell |fmt

    ...or instead of piping to spell or ispell, use >temp.txt, and open
    temp.txt in your word processor for spell-checking.

DESCRIPTION

    Pod::Spell is a Pod formatter whose output is good for spellchecking.
    Pod::Spell rather like Pod::Text, except that it doesn't put much
    effort into actual formatting, and it suppresses things that look like
    Perl symbols or Perl jargon (so that your spellchecking program won't
    complain about mystery words like "$thing" or "Foo::Bar" or "hashref").

    This class provides no new public methods. All methods of interest are
    inherited from Pod::Parser (which see). The especially interesting ones
    are parse_from_filehandle (which without arguments takes from STDIN and
    sends to STDOUT) and parse_from_file. But you can probably just make do
    with the examples in the synopsis though.

    This class works by filtering out words that look like Perl or any form
    of computerese (like "$thing" or "N>7" or "@{$foo}{'bar','baz'}",
    anything in C<...> or F<...> codes, anything in verbatim paragraphs
    (code blocks), and anything in the stopword list. The default stopword
    list for a document starts out from the stopword list defined by
    Pod::Wordlist, and can be supplemented (on a per-document basis) by
    having "=for stopwords" / "=for :stopwords" region(s) in a document.

METHODS

 new

 stopwords

            $self->stopwords->isa('Pod::WordList'); # true

 parse_from_filehandle($in_fh,$out_fh)

    This method takes an input filehandle (which is assumed to already be
    opened for reading) and reads the entire input stream looking for
    blocks (paragraphs) of POD documentation to be processed. If no first
    argument is given the default input filehandle STDIN is used.

    The $in_fh parameter may be any object that provides a getline() method
    to retrieve a single line of input text (hence, an appropriate wrapper
    object could be used to parse PODs from a single string or an array of
    strings).

 parse_from_file($filename,$outfile)

    This method takes a filename and does the following:

      * opens the input and output files for reading (creating the
      appropriate filehandles)

      * invokes the parse_from_filehandle() method passing it the
      corresponding input and output filehandles.

      * closes the input and output files.

    If the special input filename "", "-" or "<&STDIN" is given then the
    STDIN filehandle is used for input (and no open or close is performed).
    If no input filename is specified then "-" is implied. Filehandle
    references, or objects that support the regular IO operations (like
    <$fh> or $fh-<Egtgetline>) are also accepted; the handles must already
    be opened.

    If a second argument is given then it should be the name of the desired
    output file. If the special output filename "-" or ">&STDOUT" is given
    then the STDOUT filehandle is used for output (and no open or close is
    performed). If the special output filename ">&STDERR" is given then the
    STDERR filehandle is used for output (and no open or close is
    performed). If no output filehandle is currently in use and no output
    filename is specified, then "-" is implied. Alternatively, filehandle
    references or objects that support the regular IO operations (like
    print, e.g. IO::String) are also accepted; the object must already be
    opened.

ENCODINGS

    Pod::Parser, which Pod::Spell extends, is extremely naive about
    character encodings. The parse_from_file method does not apply any
    PerlIO encoding layer. If your Pod file is encoded in UTF-8, your data
    will be read incorrectly.

    You should instead use parse_from_filehandle and manage the input and
    output layers yourself.

            binmode($_, ":utf8") for ($infile, $outfile);
            $my ps = Pod::Spell->new;
            $ps->parse_from_filehandle( $infile, $outfile );

    If your output destination cannot handle UTF-8, you should set your
    output handle to Latin-1 and tell Pod::Spell to strip out words with
    wide characters.

            binmode($infile, ":utf8");
            binmode($outfile, ":encoding(latin1)");
            $my ps = Pod::Spell->new( no_wide_chars => 1 );
            $ps->parse_from_filehandle( $infile, $outfile );

ADDING STOPWORDS

    You can add stopwords on a per-document basis with "=for stopwords" /
    "=for :stopwords" regions, like so:

      =for stopwords  plok Pringe zorch   snik !qux
      foo bar baz quux quuux

    This adds every word in that paragraph after "stopwords" to the
    stopword list, effective for the rest of the document. In such a list,
    words are whitespace-separated. (The amount of whitespace doesn't
    matter, as long as there's no blank lines in the middle of the
    paragraph.) Plural forms are added automatically using
    Lingua::EN::Inflect. Words beginning with "!" are deleted from the
    stopword list -- so "!qux" deletes "qux" from the stopword list, if it
    was in there in the first place. Note that if a stopword is
    all-lowercase, then it means that it's okay in any case; but if the
    word has any capital letters, then it means that it's okay only with
    that case. So a Wordlist entry of "perl" would permit "perl", "Perl",
    and (less interestingly) "PERL", "pERL", "PerL", et cetera. However, a
    Wordlist entry of "Perl" catches only "Perl", not "perl". So if you
    wanted to make sure you said only "Perl", never "perl", you could add
    this to the top of your document:

      =for stopwords !perl Perl

    Then all instances of the word "Perl" would be weeded out of the
    Pod::Spell-formatted version of your document, but any instances of the
    word "perl" would be left in (unless they were in a C<...> or F<...>
    style).

    You can have several "=for stopwords" regions in your document. You can
    even express them like so:

      =begin stopwords
    
      plok Pringe zorch
    
      snik !qux
    
      foo bar
      baz quux quuux
    
      =end stopwords

    If you want to use E<...> sequences in a "stopwords" region, you have
    to use ":stopwords", as here:

      =for :stopwords
      virtE<ugrave>

    ...meaning that you're adding a stopword of "virtù". If you left the
    ":" out, that would mean you were adding a stopword of "virtE<ugrave>"
    (with a literal E, a literal <, etc), which will have no effect, since
    any occurrences of virtE<ugrave> don't look like a normal
    human-language word anyway, and so would be screened out before the
    stopword list is consulted anyway.

BUGS AND LIMITATIONS

 finding stopwords defined with =for

    Pod::Spell makes a single pass over the POD. Stopwords must be added
    before they show up in the POD.

 finding the wordlist

    Pod::Spell uses File::ShareDir::ProjectDistDir if you're getting errors
    about the wordlist being missing, chances are it's a problem with its
    heuristics. Set PATH_ISDEV_DEBUG=1 or PATH_FINDDEV_DEBUG=1, or both in
    your environment for debugging, and then file a bug with
    File::ShareDir::ProjectDistDir if necessary.

HINT

    If you feed output of Pod::Spell into your word processor and run a
    spell-check, make sure you're not also running a grammar-check --
    because Pod::Spell drops words that it thinks are Perl symbols, jargon,
    or stopwords, this means you'll have ungrammatical sentences, what with
    words being missing and all. And you don't need a grammar checker to
    tell you that.
