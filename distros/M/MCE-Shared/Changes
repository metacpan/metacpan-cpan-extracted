Revision history for Perl module MCE::Shared.

1.871 Wed May 13 05:30:00 EST 2020

  * Reverted prior change. Skip unicode testing for MCE::Shared::Cache
    unless Perl has Scalar::Util 1.22 or later. It is too late at this
    stage for vendors to update Perl 5.10.1 on older Operating Systems.

1.870 Tue May 12 20:00:00 EST 2020

  * Bumped minimum version required for Scalar::Util to 1.22.
    Has fix to preserve utf8 flag of string passed to dualvar.

  * Re-enabled unicode testing for MCE::Shared::Cache.

1.869 Mon May 11 22:00:00 EST 2020

  * Disabled unicode testing for MCE::Shared::Cache on Perl 5.10.1.
    Testing for keys containing unicode is failing on RedHat 6.x,
    but passing in meta::cpan (smoke tests). Thank you, Paul Howarth.

  * Share array and hash deeply; only when using the TIE interface.
    This resolves an edge case for the OO interface and passing
    nested items during construction. Thank you, Nick Tonkin.

  * Bumped MCE dependency to 1.868.

1.868 Sun May 10 22:00:00 EST 2020

  * Completed threads-like detach capability in MCE::Hobo.

1.867 Sun May 03 18:00:00 EST 2020

  * Bug fix for UTF-8 issues during inter-process communication.
    This update required undoing optimizations specific to scalar args.
    Essentially, IPC involves serialization for everything going forward.
    Install Sereal::Encoder and Sereal::Decoder for better performance.

  * Improved MCE::Hobo with threads-like detach capability. See POD.
    Resolved MCE::Hobo stalling MCE::Shared::Server during global cleanup.

  * Improved IPC in MCE::Shared::Queue with permanent fast-like dequeue
    including dequeue_nb. Going forward, the fast and barrier options are
    silently ignored if specified (i.e. no-op).

  * Improved IPC performance on Linux.

1.864 Wed Dec 04 13:00:00 EST 2019

  * Use monotonic clock if available in MCE::Hobo->yield.
    See https://www.perlmonks.org/?node_id=11109673

  * Bumped MCE dependency to 1.864.

1.863 Sun Nov 26 20:00:00 EST 2019

  * Use MCE::Channel for MCE::Hobo->yield to not incur unnecessary delays
    due to busy shared-manager process.

  * Re-factored recent changes regarding IPC safety in MCE::Shared::Server.
    This update defers signal handling for HUP, INT, PIPE, QUIT, TERM, and
    custom handlers during IPC without incurring a performance penalty.
    See POD section labled "DEFER SIGNAL" in MCE::Signal 1.863.

  * Reverted $hobo->exit back to sending the SIGQUIT signal in MCE::Hobo
    now that MCE::Shared::Server defers signal during IPC.

  * Improved reliability for spawning MCE::Hobo inside threads including
    nested parallelization, made possible using a global lock $MCE::_GMUTEX
    in MCE 1.863.

  * Updated signal handling in mce-examples/framebuffer on GitHub.

  * Bumped MCE dependency to 1.863.

1.862 Wed Sep 18 22:00:00 EST 2019

  * Hotfix for 1.861.
  * Bumped MCE dependency to 1.862.

1.861 Wed Sep 18 08:30:00 EST 2019

  * Hotfix for 1.849-1.860. The edge cases regarding signal handling have
    been finally resolved for MCE::Hobo. Thank you, Richard Kelsch for the
    use case involving ctrl-c. See mce-examples/framebuffer on GitHub.

  * Bumped MCE dependency to 1.861.

1.860 Sun Sep 15 20:00:00 EST 2019

  * Signal-handling update release.

  * SIGINT and SIGTERM safety for shared objects during IPC.
  * IPC safety in MCE::Hobo during SIGINT and SIGTERM.

  * Method $hobo->exit in MCE::Hobo now sends the SIGINT signal
    for extra reliability with MCE::Shared (previously SIGQUIT).

  * Bumped MCE dependency to 1.860.

1.850 Mon Sep 09 12:30:00 EST 2019

    is no longer needed and finally resolved with this release.

  * Updated PDL examples in the documentation including Cookbook on GitHub.
    Resolved segmentation fault in global cleanup for shared PDL objects.
    Added missing pdl_random class method to MCE::Shared.

  * Bumped MCE dependency to 1.845.

1.844 Wed Aug 14 21:30:00 EST 2019

  * Completed validation running Kelp and Raisin apps with MCE::Shared.
    For example, constructing shared objects at the top of the script
    (i.e. MCE::Shared->scalar, MCE::Shared->cache, et cetera).
    Shared objects are accessible by Plack workers (i.e. Starman).

  * Disable internal signal handling for the shared-manager process
    if spawned from inside a thread or process.

  * MCE::Hobo workers exit immediately upon receiving a SIGSEGV signal.
    This safegaurds IPC from stalling inside the manager process.

  * Enhanced the _wait_one private function in MCE::Hobo.

  * Removed Prima from the list for auto-enabling the posix_exit option.
    Prima (since 1.52) is parallel safe during global cleanup.

1.842 Sun Jul 21 19:00:00 EST 2019

  * The Windows hack introduced in 1.841 is 2x slower for one edge case.
    Therefore, reverted the Windows hack in MCE::Shared::Server.

  * Fixed race condition abnormalities in MCE::Hobo.
  * Added Parallel::ForkManager-like demonstration to MCE::Hobo.
  * Bumped MCE dependency to 1.842.

  * Improved destroy and exit cleanup in MCE::Shared::Server.

1.839 Sat Aug 25 13:00:00 EST 2018

  * Seeds the Math::Random::MT::Auto generator automatically when present
    in MCE::Hobo, similarly to Math::Random and Math::Prime::Util, to avoid
    child processes sharing the same seed value as the parent and each other.
    The new seed is computed using the current seed.

  * Updated MCE::Shared::Cache to support optional argument "expires_in" for
    set and sugar methods.

  * Is now safe running MCE::Hobo with the Wx GUI toolkit (wxWidgets).
  * Bumped MCE dependency to 1.826.

1.821 Sun Apr 02 07:00:00 EST 2017

  * Updated MCE::Shared::Queue. The following provides a comparison
    for the enhancements made regarding IPC during 1.818 through 1.821,
    in order to run on machines having "many" cores. I ran with 12, 96,
    and 192 workers on an 8 core box.

    Shared queue, dequeue 100k items.

       my $Q = MCE::Shared->queue();

       # Must start the manager manually when IO::FDPass is missing.
       # This caveat applies to Condvar, Handle, and Queue.

       MCE::Shared->start() unless $INC{'IO/FDPass.pm'};

       $Q->enqueue( 1 .. 100000 );
       $Q->end();

       MCE->new(
           max_workers => 12, 96, or 192,
           user_func   => sub {
               while ( defined ( my $item = $Q->dequeue ) ) {
                   ;
               }
           }
       )->run();

    MCE::Shared 1.821:  12 ~ 1.325 secs  96 ~ 5.206 secs  192 ~ 8.158 secs
    MCE::Shared 1.825:     ~ 0.913 secs     ~ 1.068 secs      ~ 1.560 secs

  * Results were captured on a fast 8 core system running CentOS Linux 7.
    The thing to take from this is that running many workers "no longer"
    results in up to 6.2x penalty regarding IPC.

  * When IO::FDPass is missing, croak with error if constructing a Condvar
    or Queue and forgotten to start the shared-manager process manually.

  * Bumped MCE dependency to 1.825.

1.820 Sat Apr 01 01:00:00 EST 2017

  [ENHANCEMENTS]

  * Close shared file-handles when stopping the shared-manager process.
  * Improved exporting for shared MCE::Shared::{ Array, Hash, and Ordhash }.

  * Now loads PDL::IO::Storable automatically when PDL is present. PDL must
    come before MCE::Shared. Otherwise, load PDL::IO::Storable manually.

  * Specifying Sereal for serialization falls back to Storable when PDL is
    present. A warning is emitted indicating Sereal is not used.

  [API CHANGES]

  * Removed iterator and rewind functionality from MCE::Shared::Minidb.
    This was done to streamline Minidb and MCE/Shared/Server.pm.
