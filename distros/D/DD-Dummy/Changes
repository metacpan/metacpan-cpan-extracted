0.004   2019-08-08  Released-By: PERLANCAR; Urgency: low

	- No functional changes.

0.003   2019-08-08  Released-By: PERLANCAR; Urgency: medium

	- Add DD::Dummy so we can install DD using 'cpanm DD::Dummy'.

          DD is currently not indexed by PAUSE due to permission: someone else
          used this package name in the past (although it's not used anymore and
          no longer on CPAN). While we ask for the original owner/co-maint of
          the DD module to give us co-maint, we add a dummy package DD::Dummy to
          be able to install this module from CPAN.
