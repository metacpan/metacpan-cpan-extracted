NAME
    `Test::MemoryGrowth' - assert that code does not cause growth in memory
    usage

SYNOPSIS
     use Test::More tests => 3;
     use Test::MemoryGrowth;

     use Some::Class;

     no_growth {
        my $obj = Some::Class->new;
     } 'Constructing Some::Class does not grow memory';

     my $obj = Some::Class->new;
     no_growth {
        $obj->do_thing;
     } 'Some::Class->do_thing does not grow memory';

     #### This test will fail ####
     my @list;
     no_growth {
        push @list, "Hello world";
     } 'pushing to an array does not grow memory';

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides a function to check that a given block of code does
    not result in the process consuming extra memory once it has finished.
    Despite the name of this module it does not, in the strictest sense of
    the word, test for a memory leak: that term is specifically applied to
    cases where memory has been allocated but all record of it has been
    lost, so it cannot possibly be reclaimed. While the method employed by
    this module can detect such bugs, it can also detect cases where memory
    is still referenced and reachable, but the usage has grown more than
    would be expected or necessary.

    The block of code will be run a large number of times (by default
    10,000), and the difference in memory usage by the process before and
    after is compared. If the memory usage has now increased by more than
    one byte per call, then the test fails.

    In order to give the code a chance to load initial resources it needs,
    it will be run a few times first (by default 10); giving it a chance to
    load files, AUTOLOADs, caches, or any other information that it
    requires. Any extra memory usage here will not count against it.

    This simple method is not a guaranteed indicator of the absence of
    memory resource bugs from a piece of code; it has the possibility to
    fail in both a false-negative and a false-positive way.

    False Negative
        It is possible that a piece of code causes memory usage growth that
        this module does not detect. Because it only detects memory growth
        of at least one byte per call, it cannot detect cases of linear
        memory growth at lower rates than this. Most memory usage growth
        comes either from Perl-level or C-level bugs where memory objects
        are created at every call and not reclaimed again. (These are either
        genuine memory leaks, or needless allocations of objects that are
        stored somewhere and never reclaimed). It is unlikely such a bug
        would result in a growth rate smaller than one byte per call.

        A second failure case comes from the fact that memory usage is taken
        from the Operating System's measure of the process's Virtual Memory
        size, so as to be able to detect memory usage growth in C libraries
        or XS-level wrapping code, as well as Perl functions. Because Perl
        does not agressively return unused memory to the Operating System,
        it is possible that a piece of code could use un-allocated but
        un-reclaimed memory to grow into; resulting in an increase in its
        requirements despite not requesting extra memory from the Operating
        System.

    False Positive
        It is possible that the test will claim that a function grows in
        memory, when the behaviour is in fact perfectly normal for the code
        in question. For example, the code could simply be some function
        whose behaviour is required to store extra state; for example,
        adding a new item into a list. In this case it is in fact expected
        that the memory usage of the process will increase.

    By careful use of this test module, false indications can be minimised.
    By splitting tests across many test scripts, each one can be started in
    a new process state, where most of the memory assigned from the
    Operating System is in use by Perl, so anything extra that the code
    requires will have to request more. This should reduce the false
    negative indications.

    By keeping in mind that the module simply measures the change in
    allocated memory size, false positives can be minimised, by not
    attempting to assert that certain pieces of code do not grow in memory,
    when in fact it would be expected that they do.

  Devel::MAT Integration
    If Devel::MAT is installed, this test module will use it to dump the
    state of the memory after a failure. It will create a .pmat file named
    the same as the unit test, but with the trailing .t suffix replaced with
    -TEST.pmat where `TEST' is the number of the test that failed (in case
    there was more than one).

FUNCTIONS
  no_growth { CODE } %opts, $name
    Assert that the code block does not consume extra memory.

    Takes the following named arguments:

    calls => INT
            The number of times to call the code during growth testing.

    burn_in => INT
            The number of times to call the code initially, before watching
            for memory usage.

TODO
    * Don't be Linux Specific
            Currently, this module uses a very Linux-specific method of
            determining process memory usage (namely, by inspecting
            /proc/self/status). This should really be fixed to some
            OS-neutral abstraction. Currently I am unaware of a simple
            portable mechanism to query this. Patches very much welcome. :)
