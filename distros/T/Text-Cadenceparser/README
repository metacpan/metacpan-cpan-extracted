NAME
    Text::Cadenceparser - Perl module to parse Cadence synthesis tool
    logfiles

VERSION
    version 1.12

SYNOPSIS
    my $parser = Text::Cadenceparser->new(folder => './REPORTS');

    my $nr_warnings = $parser->count('warnings');

    my $warnings = $parser->get('warnings');

    $parser->overview(); # Prints a global report of the parsing results

    $parser->list('error'); # Prints the errors to STDOUT

DESCRIPTION
    Module to parse and filter Cadence synthesis tool reports. The idea is
    to present the user with a short and comprehensible overview of the
    synthesis results.

    The module supports two ways of working: either you pass the 'folder'
    parameter, in which case all files in that folder will be searched for
    basic synthesis status reporting.

    The other way of working is that you pass an area and/or power report
    file as parameter. The module then supports generating a compact
    overview of the results sorted based on a "key" and a "threshold".

    As an example, consider a design that has been simulated for power
    results. Pass the are and power report files as parameter, and select as
    "key" 'active' and "threshold" '5'. The report will list all first-level
    design units that contribute to the active power consumption and that
    have a power consumption of more that 5% of the total power. The units
    that contribute less than 5% of the power will be merged into a single
    block and their resulting power consumption is also listed.

    For the power, area and leakage of the toplevel design (meaning the
    total figure minus the numbers reported for the subunits) an entry
    'toplevel' is added to the report.

METHODS
  "new(%parameters)"
    This constructor returns a new Text::Cadenceparser object. Supported
    parameters are listed below

    folder
        The folder where to gather the logfiles. If this option is passed,
        the module will search through the folder and generate a short and
        comprehensive overview of the results of the last synthesis run. If
        you pass this parameter, other parameters will ignored.

    area_rpt
        Pass an area report file that will be used to gather area input. Not
        to be used in combination with the 'folder' parameter.

    power_rpt
        Pass a power report file that will be used to gather power input.
        Not to be used in combination with the 'folder' parameter.

    key Key to sort the area/power results. Possible options are

        active
        leakage
        area

    threshold
        The percentage-wise threshold of "key" that the design units need to
        be above in order to be listed in the result table.

  "files_parsed()"
    This method reports the number of files that were parsed when creating
    the object.

  "count($type)"
    This method returns the counted number of $type that were parsed.

    $type can be either 'info', 'warning' or 'error'.

  "overview()"
    This method returns an overview of all parsed messages.

  "get($type)"
    Returns a hash containing the messages of type $type.

    $type can be either 'info', 'warning' or 'error'.

  "list($type)"
    List the messages of type $type to STDOUT.

    $type can be either 'info', 'warning' or 'error'.

  "slack($clock)"
    Report the slack of the synthesis run for a specific clock net

  "report()"
    Reports the reports/logs that are read

  "get_final($key)"
    Report the valus of a $key that was extracted from the final.rpt report.
    Returns the value or "undef" in case the value does not exist.
