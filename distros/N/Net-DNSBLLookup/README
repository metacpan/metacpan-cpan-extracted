Net::OpenProxyLookup version 0.03
=================================

This module queries the major Open Proxy DNS Blocklists, including Sorbs,
Easynet, NJABL, DSBL, and Blitzed.  Open Proxies are servers that allow
hackers to mask their true IP address.  Some of these blocklists also contain 
hosts that have been known to send spam.  This module distinguishes the
results between Open Proxy and Spam/Open Relay servers.

This module can be used to block or flag Internet connections coming from
Open Proxy or Spam servers.  Why would you want to do this?  Hackers often
use Open Proxy servers to hide their true IP address when doing "bad" stuff.
This includes using purchasing stuff with stolen credit cards, and getting
around IP Address based restrictions
