/*
** List of all hash files (languages) which will be supported by jspell.
**
** This variable has a complex format so that many options can be
** specified.  The format is as follows:
**
**        <language>[,<make-options>...] [<language> [,<make-options> ...] ...]
**
** where
**
**        language        is the name of a subdirectory of the
**                        "languages" directory
**        make-options        are options that are to be passed to "make" in
**                        the specified directory.  The make-options
**                        should not, in general, specify a target, as
**                        this will be provided by the make process.
**
** For example, if LANGUAGES is:
**
**        "{english,VARIANTS=american altamer} {deutsch}",
**
** then the English and Deutsch (German) languages will be supported,
** and when the English dictionary is built, the variable
** 'VARIANTS=american altamer' will be passed to the makefile.
**
** Notes on the syntax: The makefile is not very robust.  If you have
** make problems, or if make seems to in the language-subdirs
** dependency, check your syntax.  The makefile adds single quotes to
** the individual variables in the LANGUAGES specification, so don't
** use quotes of any kind.
**
** In the future, the first language listed in this variable will
** become the default, and the DEFHASH, DEFLANG, DEFDICT, and DEFPAFF,
** variables will all become obsolete.  So be sure to put your default
** language first, to make later conversion easier!
**
** Notes on options for the various languages will be found in the
** Makefiles for those languages.  Some of those languages may require
** you to also change various limits limits like MASKBITS or the
** length parameters.
