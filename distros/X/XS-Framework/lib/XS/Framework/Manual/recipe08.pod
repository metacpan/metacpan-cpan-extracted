=head1 Creating artificial hierarchy

Let's assume there is a I<different> C++ libraries, offering similar
capabilities, e.g. WAV-files playing library and multimedia-files
(ogg, aac, mp3) playing library. Their interfaces are like:

    /* is able to hold only files in WAV-format */
    struct WAVFile {
        WAVFile(const char* name): name_{name} {}
        const char* name() const noexcept { return name_; }
    private:
        const char* name_;
    };

    /* is able to hold any files only in ogg, mp3 and aac formats */
    struct MultimediaFile {
        MultimediaFile(const char* name, const char* format): name_{name}, format_{format} {}
        const char* name() const noexcept { return name_; }
        const char* format() const noexcept { return format_; }
    private:
        const char* name_;
        const char* format_;
    };

    struct WAVPlayer {
      WAVPlayer(double preferred_bitrate): preferred_bitrate_{preferred_bitrate} {}
      std::string play_wav(WAVFile* file) {
        std::string result = "wav-player is playing ";
        result += file->name();
        result += " with bitrate ";
        result += std::to_string(preferred_bitrate_);
        return result;
      }
      double preferred_bitrate() const noexcept { return preferred_bitrate_; }
      WAVPlayer* clone() const noexcept { return new WAVPlayer(preferred_bitrate_); }
    private:
      double preferred_bitrate_;
    };

    struct MultimediaPlayer {
      MultimediaPlayer(int quality): quality_{quality} {}
      std::string play_file(MultimediaFile* file) {
        std::string result = "player is playing ";
        result += file->name();
        result += " (";
        result += file->format();
        result += ")";
        result += " with quality ";
        result += std::to_string(quality_);
        return result;
      }
      int quality() const noexcept { return quality_; }
      MultimediaPlayer* clone() const noexcept { return new MultimediaPlayer(quality_); }
    private:
      int quality_;
    };

Their typemaps are trivial without inheritance and are omitted here (see
C<t/cookbook/recipe08.xsi> for full sources).

What we would like to achive is to "fix" C++ hierarchy in Perl: as
C<WAVPlayer> and C<MultimediaPlayer> almost the same interface, and as
C<MultimediaPlayer> I<looks> as the most generic one, let's have xs-adapter
for C<MultimediaPlayer> Perl, and let it inherits C<WAVPlayer> xs-adapter,
i.e. offers capabilities of the both C++ classes. (The xs-adapters for
C<WAVFile> and C<MultimediaFile> are omitted)

    MODULE = MyTest                PACKAGE = MyTest::Cookbook::WAVPlayer
    PROTOTYPES: DISABLE

    std::string WAVPlayer::play_wav(WAVFile* file)

    double WAVPlayer::preferred_bitrate()

    WAVPlayer* WAVPlayer::new(double preferred_bitrate) # (1)

    WAVPlayer* WAVPlayer::clone() { // (2)
        Object self{ST(0)};
        PROTO = self.stash();   // (3)
        RETVAL = THIS->clone(); // (4)
    }

The auto-generated constructor (1) will forward all provided parameters to the
underlying C++ class; it is also aware of 1st argument C<CLASS/PROTO>, i.e.
SV* blessing will be performed into final class.

The C<clone> (2) method performs acutally the same, hovewer we can't leave it as:

    WAVPlayer* WAVPlayer::clone()

because the PROTO hint will be empty, and by C<TypemapObject> rules it will
be blessed into C<TypemapObject::package>, i.e. to C<MyTest::Cookbook::WAVPlayer>,
in other words it is not inheritance-aware. To fix that we have to manually
write the C<clone> method, which will forward to C<clone> method of underlying
C++ object (4) and bless it it to the actual Perl object package (3).

Let's write xs-adapter for C<MultimediaPlayer>, which fixes C++ class hierarchy:

    MODULE = MyTest                PACKAGE = MyTest::Cookbook::MultimediaPlayer
    PROTOTYPES: DISABLE

    MultimediaPlayer* MultimediaPlayer::new(double preferred_bitrate, int quality) {
        (void)preferred_bitrate;    // silence warning
        PROTO = Stash::from_name(CLASS).call_next(cv, &ST(1), 1);   // (5)
        if (!PROTO.defined()) XSRETURN_UNDEF;
        RETVAL = new MultimediaPlayer(quality);                     // (6)
    }

    std::string MultimediaPlayer::play_file(MultimediaFile* file)

    int MultimediaPlayer::quality()

    MultimediaPlayer* MultimediaPlayer::clone() {
        Object self{ST(0)};
        PROTO = self.call_next(cv);         // (7)
        RETVAL = THIS->clone();             // (8)
    }

    BOOT {
        auto stash = Stash(__PACKAGE__, GV_ADD);
        stash.inherit("MyTest::Cookbook::WAVPlayer");   // (9)
    }

First, in the constructor C<new> the base B<SV* wrapper> have to be created in
(5). It actually forwards call to the C<new> method of C<WAVPlayer> xs-adapter
(1). Then it creates C<MultimediaPlayer> C++ object in (6) and, as the C<PROTO>
variable already contains SV* wrapper, by L<XS::Framework> rules the
C<MultimediaPlayer> C++ object will attached to SV*. Please, note that SV*
wrapper will be already blessed into the right package after (5).

The C<clone> method (7)..(8) is similar to the C<new> constructor, i.e. it
first clones (7) XS-adapter for C<WAVPlayer> (which clones C++ class C<WAVPlayer>),
and after (8) the pointer to C++ C<MultimediaPlayer> object will be attached
to it. Please, note, that C<THIS> variable is C++ C<MultimediaPlayer> at
line (8), and it is C<WAVPlayer> at line (4).

It should be noted, that in (5) and (7) the C<call_next> is used. It could be
changed to C<call_SUPER>, but C<call_next> is somewhat more general.

In the line (9) we should specify that  C<MultimediaPlayer> xs-adapter inherits
from C<WAVPlayer> adapter. The following test proves correctness:

    my $wav = MyTest::Cookbook::WAVFile->new('sample.wav');
    my $ogg = MyTest::Cookbook::MultimediaFile->new('sample.ogg', 'ogg');
    my $player = MyTest::Cookbook::MultimediaPlayer->new(44100, 6);
    my $clone = $player->clone;
    is $clone->quality, 6;
    is $clone->preferred_bitrate, 44100;
    is $clone->play_file($ogg), 'player is playing sample.ogg (ogg) with quality 6';
    is $clone->play_wav($wav), 'wav-player is playing sample.wav with bitrate 44100.000000';

The short summary: if needed it is possible to fix/enrich C++ class hierarchry
in Perl classes (xs-adapters).
