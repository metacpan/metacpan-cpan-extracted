=head1 NAME

TestML1 - DEPRECATED Generic Software Testing Meta Language

=head1 VERSION

This document describes L<TestML1> version B<0.57>.

=head1 STATUS

TestML1 is DEPRECATED.

Actually TestML1 is the old 2009-2018 version of TestML, in case you still
need it. Check out the new TestML.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    # file t/testml/encode.tml
    %TestML 0.1.0

    Title = 'Tests for AcmeEncode'
    Plan = 3

    *text.apply_rot13 == *rot13
    *text.apply_md5   == *md5

    === Encode some poetry
    --- text
    There once was a fellow named Ingy,
    Combining languages twas his Thingy.
    --- rot13
    Gurer bapr jnf n sryybj anzrq Vatl,
    Pbzovavat ynathntrf gjnf uvf Guvatl.
    --- md5: 7a1538ff9fc8edf8ea55d02d0b0658be

    === Encode a password
    --- text: soopersekrit
    --- md5: 64002c26dcc62c1d6d0f1cb908de1435

This TestML document defines 2 assertions, and defines 2 data blocks. The
first block has 3 data points, but the second one has only 2. Therefore the
rot13 assertion applies only to the first block, while the the md5 assertion
applies to both. This results in a total of 3 tests, which is specified in the
meta Plan statement in the document.

To run this test you would have a normal test file that looks like this:

    use TestML1;
    use t::Bridge;

    TestML1->new(
        testml => 'testml/encode.tml',
        bridge => 't::Bridge',
    )->run;

The apply_* functions are defined in the bridge class that is specified
outside this test (C<t/Bridge.pm>).

=head1 DESCRIPTION

TestML is a generic, programming language agnostic, meta language for writing
unit tests. The idea is that you can use the same test files in multiple
implementations of a given programming idea. Then you can be more certain that
your application written in, say, Python matches your Perl implementation.

In a nutshell you write a bunch of data tests that have inputs and expected
results. Using a simple syntax, you specify what functions the data must pass
through to produce the expected results. You use a bridge class to write the
data functions that pass the data through your application.

In Perl 5, TestML is the evolution of the L<Test::Base> module. It has a
superset of Test:Base's goals. The data markup syntax is currently exactly the
same as Test::Base.
