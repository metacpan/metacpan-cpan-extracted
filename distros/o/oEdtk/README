	oEdtk IS A PROJECT FOR PRINTING PROCESSING specialized for 
	enhancement of data tracking and knowledge for industrial printing 
	processing.

	oEdtk is a group of methods that allow the user to quickly 
	develop application for parsing data stream. Those methods allow
	the user to prepare the data so that printing application build 
	documents with these data.
	
	This module is a toolkit for developping parsing application
	dedicated to DSC Compuset or Excel and Latex. 
	You would create application by loading stream documentation (such as
	Cobol CopyBooks). Developpers will customize their application. 
	Then the core (basics functions) of this module is used by the 
	applications to product documents such as mailings, invoices, banking 
	statement, etc. 
	
	In the future, we would like to add a user interface.
