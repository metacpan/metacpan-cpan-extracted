NAME

    Net::DNS::Async::Simple - A simple wrapper around the excellent
    Net::DNS::Async

SYNOPSIS

        use Net::DNS::Async::Simple;
        use Test::More;
        my $list = [
            {   query => ['www.realms.org','A'],
            },{ query => ['174.136.1.7','PTR'],
                nameServers => ['8.8.4.4','4.2.2.2']
            }
        ];
        Net::DNS::Async::Simple::massDNSLookup($list);
        ok $list->[0]->{address} eq '174.136.1.7', 'forward lookup worked';
        ok $list->[1]->{ptrdname} eq 'tendotfour.realms.org', 'reverse lookup worked';

DESCRIPTION

FUNCTIONS

 massDNSLookup($list, %extraArgs);

    Takes one required argument, which is an ARRAY reference, each entry
    contains a HASH reference containing at least a 'query' attribute,
    which is itself an ARRAY reference. These arguments end up being passed
    into a Net::DNS::Resolver::query call, the semantics of which depend on
    the specific kind of DNS record being looked up.

    For more record types, the first query argument is the 'key' (for A
    records, the name to be looked up, for example) and the second query
    argument is the type of DNS record.

    The results of the DNS query are added to the appropriate HASH
    reference, using the same keys that come back from response, as a
    Net::DNS::Packet object. For A records, this will populate the 'name'
    and 'address' fields. PTR will populate the 'ptrdname' field.

    This function will never throw an exception, nor does it return
    anything useful. Timeouts and errors will be added to the individual
    HASH references as appropriate.

    %extraArgs is optional.

    timeout

      Will force this function to return in no more than this many seconds.
