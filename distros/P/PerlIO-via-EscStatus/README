EscStatus is a PerlIO layer for printing a status line on a dumb
terminal.  The line is erased and redrawn with carriage returns and
backspaces.  Status lines are communicated "in band" to the layer
using an escape sequence.

The idea is that because it's a layer it sees all ordinary output made
with "print" etc from anywhere in the program or libraries and can
erase the status line to let that output go out as normal, with the
status then reprinted.

The prerequisites are

    * Perl version 5.8.3 or higher (probably)
    * Regexp::Common
    * Term::Size

An extension for ProgressMonitor is provided, but ProgressMonitor is
entirely optional.
