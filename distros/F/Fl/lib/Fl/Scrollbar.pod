=head1 NAME

Fl::Scrollbar - Slider with Arrow Buttons at Both Ends

=head1 Description

The Fl::Scrollbar draws a slider with arrow buttons at the ends of the
scrollbar.

=for html <center><img src="http://www.fltk.org/doc-1.3/scrollbar.png" /></center>

Clicking on the arrows move up/left and down/right by linesize(). Scrollbars
also accept FL_SHORTCUT events: the arrows move by linesize(), and vertical
scrollbars take Page Up/Down (they move by the page size minus linesize()) and
Home/End (they jump to the top or bottom).

Scrollbars have step(1) preset (they always return integers). If desired you
can set the step() to non-integer values. You will then have to use casts to
get at the floating-point versions of value() from Fl::Slider.

=head1 Methods

Fl::Scrollbar inherits from Fl::Slider, Fl::Valuator and Fl::Widget. On top
of that, it exposes the following methods...

=head2 new(...)

    my $val_a = Fl::Scrollbar->new(0, 0, 250, 500, 'Important Stuff');
    my $val_b = Fl::Scrollbar->new(0, 0, 250, 500);

The constructor creates a new widget using the given position, size, and
label.

The default boxtype is FL_DOWN_BOX.

The destructor removes the widget.

    definitions => [
            {required => [[qw[int x]], [qw[int y]], [qw[int w]], [qw[int h]]],
             optional => [['const char *', 'label', ' 0']],
             returns  => 'Fl_Scrollbar *'
            }
    ]
};
xs {name        => 'DESTROY',
    definitions => [{returns => 'void'}]
};
xs {name        => 'draw',
    definitions => [{returns  => 'void' }
    ]
};
xs {name        => 'handle',
    definitions => [{required => [[qw[int event]]], returns  => 'int'  }
    ]
};

=pod

=head2 linesize(...)

    $val_a->linesize( 12 );

This number controls how big the steps are that the arrow keys do.

In addition page up/down move by the size last sent to value() minus one
linesize(). The default is 16.

=cut

xs {name        => 'linesize',
    definitions => [
            {required => [[qw[int i]]],
             returns  => 'void'
            }
    ]
};

=pod

=head2 value(...)

    $val_a->value( 12 );
    my $value = $val_b->value();

Gets or sets the value of the slider in the scrollbar.

    $value = $val_b->value( $pos, $windowSize, $first, $total );

Sets the position (first line displayed), size (number of lines displayed),
and range of the slider in the scrollbar (number of first and total lines).

You should call this every time your window changes size, your data changes
size, or your scroll position changes (even if in response to a callback from
this scrollbar). All necessary calls to redraw() are done.

xs {name        => 'value',
    definitions => [
            {returns  => 'int'},
            {required => [[qw[int i]]],
             returns  => 'int'
            },
            {required => [[qw[int pos]], [qw[int windowSize]], [qw[int first]], [qw[int total]]],
             returns  => 'void'
            }
    ]
};
