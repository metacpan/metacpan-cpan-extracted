NAME
    JSON::Hyper - extract links from JSON via a schema

SYNOPSIS
     my $hyper = JSON::Hyper->new($hyperschema);
     my $json  = from_json( ... );
     my @links = $hyper->find_links($json->[1]->{some}->{object});
     foreach my $link (@links)
     {
       printf("<%s> (%s)", $link->{href}, $link->{rel});
     }

DESCRIPTION
    The JSON Hyper Schema proposal defines hypertext navigation through data
    structures represented by JSON.

  Constructor
    "new($hyperschema)"
        Given a JSON (or equivalent Perl nested hashref/arrayref structure)
        Hyper Schema, returns a Perl object capable of interpreting that
        schema.

        If the schema is omitted, defaults to the JSON Referencing hyper
        schema (described at <http://json-schema.org/json-ref>)

  Methods
    "schema"
        Returns the original schema as a hashref/arrayref structure.

    "ua"
        Get/set the LWP::UserAgent instance used to retrieve things.

    "find_links($object, $base)"
        Given a JSON object (or equivalent Perl nested hashref/arrayref
        structure) and optionally a base URL for interpreting relative URI
        references, returns a list of links found on object node. Does not
        operate recursively.

        Each link is a JSON::Hyper::Link object.

    "get($uri)"
        Performs an HTTP request for the given URI and returns a list of
        Perl nested hashref/arrayref structures corresponding to the JSON
        response. The URI may contain a fragment identifier, which will be
        interpreted according to the schema's fragment resolution method.
        Fragment resolution methods supported include:

        *       slash-delimited (default)

        *       dot-delimited

        *       jsonpath

        For example, assuming the hyper schema specifies slash-delimited
        fragments, the following:

         my $hyper    = JSON::Hyper->new($hyperschema);
         my ($result) = $hyper->get('http://example.com/data.json#foo/bar/0');

        Is roughly equivalent to:

         use JSON;
         use LWP::UserAgent;
         my $ua       = LWP::UserAgent->new;
         my $response = $ua->get('http://example.com/data.json');
         my $object   = from_json($response->decoded_content);
         my $result   = $object->{foo}{bar}[0];

        Note, if called multiple times on the same URL will return not just
        equivalent objects, but the same object.

        So, why does this method return a list of results instead of just a
        single result? In most cases, there will be either 0 or 1 items on
        the list; however, JSONPath allows a path to match multiple nodes,
        so there will occasionally be more than one result. (In scalar
        context, this method just returns the first result anyway.)

    "resolve_fragment($object, $fragment)"
        Used by "get" to resolve the fragment part of a URL against an
        object.

    "process_includes($object, $base, $recurse)"
        Given an JSON object (or equivalent Perl nested hashref/arrayref
        structure) and optional base URL, crawls the object finding
        rel="full" links, dereferences them using "get" and replaces the
        appropriate nodes with the retrieved content. $recurse is a boolean.

        This has the effect of rel="full" behaving like inclusion does in
        various programming languages.

        This modifies the given object rather than creating a new object.

  Utilities
    "JSON::Hyper::json_ref()"
        Returns the JSON referencing hyperschema as a hashref.
