NAME
    Template::Plugin::Perl - TT2 plugin to import Perl built-in functions

VERSION
    This document describes Template::Plugin::Perl 0.06 released on 12
    March, 2007.

SYNOPSIS
      [% USE Perl %]

      [% Perl.log(100) %]
      [% Perl.rand(1) %]
      [% Perl.exp(2) %]
      [% Perl.sprintf("%.0f", 3.5) %]
      [% Perl.pow(2, 3) %]   # 2 ** 3;
      [% Perl.eval('2**3') %]
      [% Perl.sin(3.14) %]
      [% Perl.cos(0) %]

      [% Perl.join(',', 'a', 'b', 'c') %]
      [% list = ['a','b','c'];
         Perl.join(',' list) %]

DESCRIPTION
    As a TT programmer, I found it quite inflexible to use the Template
    Toolkit's presentation language Language due to the very limited
    vocabulary. So I wrote this little plugin in order to open a window for
    the template file to the full richness of most Perl built-in functions,
    making the Template language a "programming language" in a much more
    serious sense.

    As I writing this stuff, The Template language does not support
    exponential operator (**). So I add an extra function 'pow' to support
    this missing feature. However, there is no doubt that we could treat
    "Perl.eval" as a good workaround, just as the "SYNOPSIS" demonstrates.

    According to the current implementation, don't use the functions for
    real @ARRAYs, such as shift, pop. They won't function at all. However,
    "sort", "join", and "reverse" are notable exceptions. Moreover,
    Arguments of all Perl.* functions are passed by values, and returned in
    scalar context, so some functions for list data, like map and grep, make
    little sense in this context.

    builtins that modify their arguments won't work either, such as "chomp",
    "chop", and "pos".

    Please keep in mind I just used AUTOLOAD, eval, and Data::Dumper to do
    the magic here.

    If you're looking for even more functions, I suggest you take a look at
    the Template::Plugin::POSIX module which exports the excellent POSIX
    repertoire.

METHODS
    new Constructor called by the TT2 template system

    throw
        TT2 exception handling procedure.

    pow Non-Perl builtin added for ease of use

TODO
    *   Add more unit tests
