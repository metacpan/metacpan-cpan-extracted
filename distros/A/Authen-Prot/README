NAME
    Authen::Prot - Perl extension for accessing protected password
    database

SYNOPSIS
      use Authen::Prot;

      Authen::Prot::setprpwent();

      $pw = Authen::Prot->getprpwent();

      $pw = Authen::Prot->getprpwuid(0);

      $pw = Authen::Prot->getprpwnam('daemon');

      print "$pw->ufld_fd_name\n";

      $pw->ufld_fd_slogin(time);

      $pw->putprpwnam();

      $crypt = Authen::Prot::bigcrypt('test', 'test'); # not avail on DEC/OSF

      Authen::Prot::endprpwent();

DESCRIPTION
    The Authen::Prot module provides access to the protected
    password database via the getprpwent, getprpwuid, getprpwnam,
    getprpwaid, setprpwent, endprpwent, and putprpwnam system calls
    available on those Unix systems using the Protected Password
    database written by SecureWare Inc. (c).

  METHODS

    The availability of some of the methods below will depend on how
    the Protected Password database has been implemented on your
    system.

    $crypt = Authen::Prot::bigcrypt($key, $salt)
        Encrypted $key using the bigcrypt(3) system call if
        available and returns the result. Not available on DEC/OSF,
        via this package yet.

    $pw = Authen::Prot::getprpwent()
        This method returns a reference to a blessed Authen::Prot
        object. You may then use this reference to retrieve values
        of fields in the protected password database. When this
        method is first called it returns the first entry in the
        database, on each subsequent call it returns the next entry.
        See getprpwent(3) for further information on which records
        are returned.

    $pw = Authen::Prot::getprpwuid($uid)
        This method returns a reference to a blessed Authen::Prot
        object if an entry with a uid of that passed is found,
        otherwise it will return `undef'. You may then use this
        reference to retrieve values of fields in the protected
        password database. See getprpwuid(3) for further information
        on how records are returned.

    $pw = Authen::Prot::getprpwaid($aid)
        This method returns a reference to a blessed Authen::Prot
        object if an entry with a aid of that passed is found,
        otherwise it will return `undef'. You may then use this
        reference to retrieve values of fields in the protected
        password database. See getprpwaid(3) for further information
        on how records are returned.

    $pw = Authen::Prot::getprpwnam($name)
        This method returns a reference to a blessed Authen::Prot
        object if an entry with a login name of that passed is
        found, otherwise it will return `undef'. You may then use
        this reference to retrieve values of fields in the protected
        password database. See getprpwnam(3) for further information
        on how records are returned.

    Authen::Prot::setprpwent()
        Calling setprpwent effectively rewinds the pointer into the
        protected password databases so that a subsequent call to
        getprpwent will return the first record. See setprpwent(3)
        for further information on the function of this method.

    Authen::Prot::endprpwent()
        Calling endprpwent effectively closes the protected password
        database. See endprpwent(3) for further information on the
        function of this method.

    $pw->putprpwnam()
        This method commits a Prot object to the protected password
        database. Setting $pw->uflg_fg_name to 0 will delete the
        corresponding entry. See putprpwnam(3) for further
        information on the function of this method.

    $pw->pr_struct_field_name() / $pw->pr_struct_field_name($value)
        The fields available from the methods described above,
        depend on the definition of the pr_struct structure in the
        /usr/include/prot.h on your system, and the information
        available I have to interpret them. This module will attempt
        to parse your prot.h file and generate a XS function for
        each field available on your system. The pr_struct typically
        consists of four structures given the name of ufld, sfld,
        uflg and sflg for User fields, System fields, User flags and
        System flags respectively.

        To allow for the syntax differences between C and Perl the
        field names have been re-written replacing the struct `.'
        with a `_' in Perl. For example the User field login name
        would be referenced

        in C as:

                ufld.fd_name 

        and in Perl as:

                $pw->ufld_fd_name
