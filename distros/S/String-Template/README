NAME

    String::Template - Fills in string templates from hash of fields

VERSION

    version 0.19

SYNOPSIS

     use String::Template;
     
     my %fields = ( num => 2, str => 'this', date => 'Feb 27, 2008' );
     
     my $template = "...<num%04d>...<str>...<date:%Y/%m/%d>...\n";
     
     print expand_string($template, \%fields);
     #prints: "...0002...this...2008/02/27..."

DESCRIPTION

    Generate strings based on a template.

FUNCTIONS

 expand_string

     my $str = expand_string($template, \%fields, $undef_flag);

    Fills in a simple template with values from a hash, replacing tokens
    like "<fieldname>" with the value from the hash $fields->{fieldname}.

    Some special characters can be used to impose formatting on the fields:

     % - treat like a sprintf() format
         e.g.  <int%02d>
    
     : - treat like a L<POSIX::strftime()> format
         e.g. <date:%Y-%m-%d>
    
     ! - Just like ':', but with gmtime instead of localtime
         e.g. <gmdate!%Y-%m-%d %H:%M>
    
     # - treat like args to substr()
         e.g. <str#0,2> or <str#4>

    For the ':' strftime formats, the field is parsed by Date::Parse, so it
    can handle any format that can handle.

    Handling of undefined fields can be controlled with $undef_flag. If it
    is false (default), undefined fields are simply replace with an empty
    string. If set to true, the field is kept verbatim. This can be useful
    for multiple expansion passes.

 expand_stringi

     my $str = expand_stringi($template, \%fields, $undef_flag);

    expand_stringi works just like expand_string, except that tokens and
    hash keys are treated case insensitively.

 missing_values

     my @missing = missing_values($template, \%fields, $dont_allow_undefs);

    Checks to see if the template variables in a string template exist in a
    hash. Set $dont_allow_undefs to 1 to also check to see if the values
    for all such keys are defined.

    Returns a list of missing keys or an empty list if no keys were
    missing.

 expand_hash

     my $status = expand_hash($hash[, $maxdepth]);

    Expand a hash of templates/values. This function will repeatedly
    replace templates in the values of the hash with the values of the hash
    they reference, until either all "<>" templates are gone, or it has
    iterated $maxdepth times (default 10).

    Returns undef if there are unexpanded templates left, otherwise true.

SEE ALSO

    String::Format performs a similar function, with a different syntax.
