# OpenTracing Manual

## Description

This Manual is a quick overview of what is available in Perl related to the
OpenTracing API related Interface Definition.

It targets three different audiences:

- Application developers and Devops
- Framework or Integration Developers
- Tracing service Implementation providers

Included is a list of Perl Modules and those that are on the horizon.

## Introduction

From the OpenTracing IO website:

> OpenTracing is comprised of an API specification, frameworks and libraries
> that have implemented the specification, and documentation for the project.
> OpenTracing allows developers to add instrumentation to their application code
> using APIs that do not lock them into any one particular product or vendor.

> Distributed tracing, also called distributed request tracing, is a method used
> to profile and monitor applications, especially those built using a
> microservices architecture. Distributed tracing helps pinpoint where failures
> occur and what causes poor performance.
