   and marked the old public methods with identifier as deprecated
 - broke out the MemoryBackend, FileBackend, SharedMemoryBackend into
   distinct and reusable classes
 - fixed a long outstanding bug in the unit tests that made working
   caches appear to fail
 - changed the meaning of object and cache size for file system based
   caches to consistently reflect the total size of the objects on disk,
   but not including the directory overhead

0.09 2001-09-10-12-10
 - released version 0.09
 - applied Axel Beckert patch to fix the expiration units
 - applied Ken Williams's directory creation patch to pass all tests
 - changed the license to be either the GPL or the Artistic license
 - added Jay Sachs' implementation of NullCache
 - modified the remove methods to avoid croaking if two cache
   instances are both purging or limiting at the same time
 - migrated to a factory-like model with private constructors
   to fix the auto_purge_interval functionality
 - updated the documentation to better reflect that size means
   size in bytes
 - started version 0.09

0.08 2001-04-26-08-53
 - released version 0.08
 - renamed the auto_purge option to auto_purge_interval
 - added the auto_purge_on_set and auto_purge_on_get options
 - moved the Auto_Purge and Reset_Auto_Purge methods to BaseCache
   as the instance methods _auto_purge and _reset_auto_purge
 - added the auto_purge option and property to the base cache interface
   and implementations.  This option will call the purge method on
   the cache after the specified interval expires
 - renamed _set_namespace to set_namespace (i.e., made it public)
 - added the set_object method to the cache interface
 - updated the test scripts and CREDITS file
 - updated the perldoc formatting to look better in HTML

0.07 2001-03-27-08-55
 - released version 0.07
 - prepared for initial CPAN release
 - improved Cache::Cache documentation
 - removed last "use IPC::Shareable"
 - added support in the Makefile.PL to conditionally build the
   SharedMemoryCache, which requires IPC::ShareLite, and thus runs only
   on certain architectures.  Also broke out the IPC related routines
   into the SharedCacheUtils package.
 - started version 0.07

0.06 2001-03-23-08-36
 - release version 0.06
 - added the get_identifiers method to the Cache interface, implemented
   the method for all classes, added a new test, and updated the test
   scripts
 - added the size property to Object
 - added the _freeze and _thaw methods to the BaseCache class and
   modified all children classes to use them
 - revert to separate freeze and thaws on the memory based caches to
   ensure that cached data isn't modified at any time
 - major rewrite of the size aware cache logic
 - added the CacheMetaData class, which is used to efficiently keep track
   of a size aware cache state
 - refactored the instance specific limit_size routines into the
   generic Limit_Size method in CacheUtils
 - updated the size aware cache implementations to use the CacheMetaData
   and Limit_Size methods
 - improved the SizeAwareCacheTester and updated the test scripts
 - removed unnecessary clone call from the SharedMemoryCache and the
   SizeAwareSharedMemoryCache
 - added exclusive locking on the shared cache for operations that
   will both read and write to the cache
 - replaced the cache_hash_ref instance property in MemoryCache with
   a class property and updated the SharedMemoryCache and
   SizeAwareSharedMemoryCache modules accordingly
 - started version 0.06

0.05 2001-03-20-10-25
 - released version 0.05
 - updated Storable dependency to 1.011

 - moved max_size logic from the _store method to the set method
 - started version 0.04

0.03 2001-03-10-12-40

   permissive default directory umask, which can also be optionally
   overridden
 - updated documentation and code style
 - completely rewrote and improved the limit_size method for a major
   performance gain
 - updated the syntax for expiration times to include the [number] [unit]
   format, e.g. "10 seconds"
 - added the get_object method to the Cache interface, which allows
   access to the underlying cache object (without potentially expiring
   the object)
 - added the get_namespace and get_default_expires_in methods to the
   Cache interface definition
 - updated the MANIFEST
 - checked in preliminary cache benchmarking code
 - fixed bug fixed bug #406030 -- default_expires_in never invoked
