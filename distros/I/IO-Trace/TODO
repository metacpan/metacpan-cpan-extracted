Some desired features to implement or known issues to fix with iotrace:

 - Redirecting to a file prematurely closes the file handle because it appears as can_read from the select loop for some reason.

 - TTY terminal for STDIN breaks when open3 converts it to a pipe.

 - Handle signals by forwarding them on to the target process, such as SIGTERM SIGINT SIGHUP SIGUSR1 etc.
