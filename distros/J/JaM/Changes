1.0.10 2002/03/08 joern
	Bugfixes:
	- setting Reply-To didn't work
	
	Features:
	- added "Reply Group" button which replies to the address
	  of the "To:" header field. Useful for replying into
	  mailing lists.
	- you can simply specify another From address per mail
	  by selecting the appropriate entry of the recipient
	  popup in the compose mail dialog.
	- if you have many email aliases forwarded to one account
	  this one is for you: when replying JaM checks the To:
	  field against the addresses listed in the Non-Reply
	  user configuration field (it assumes that these are
	  your aliases). The first address which matches and
	  is not your normal From: address configured in the
	  mail account window, will be set as From by default.
	  This way you don't change your address inside one
	  thread, if a mail was posted to one of your alias
	  addresses.
	- mail filter: regex filter also available as a
	  case relevant version.

1.0.9 2001/11/15 joern
	Bugfix:
	- text was wrapped before quoted when replying to mails

1.0.8 2001/11/06 joern
	Bugfix:
	- non multipart HTML Mails, where the HTML message
	  is contained in the main body of the mail, were displayed
	  without filtering html tags.

1.0.7 2001/11/02 joern
	Bugfix:
	- sent mail were wrapped with wrong length
	- removed debugging output to STDERR

1.0.6 2001/11/02 joern
	Bugfix:
	- wrapping was done after converting URLs to links,
	  so the added HTML code was counted which leads
	  to early wrapping.

1.0.5 2001/11/02 joern
	Features:
	- Great improvements on wrapping long lines of received
	  mails and saved drafts / templates, e.g. automatic
	  paragraph detection and auto insertion. Lines are wrapped
	  when displaying and sending mail only (not altering received
	  mails), so line wrapping is preserved for replies and saved
	  mails.
	- You can configure wrapping by two new User Configuration
	  parameters: 'View Mail Wrapping Line Length' (Default: 85) and
	  'Send Mail Wrapping Line Length' (Default: 72).
	- Netscape Browser program is configurable (e.g. for using Mozilla
	  instead) and started in background by JaM.
	- the new parameters push schema version to 7.

1.0.4 2001/10/27 joern
	Bugfixes:
	- Due to a incompatible interface change in DBI 1.20
	  (selectall_hashref) JaM now needs DBI >= 1.20.

1.0.3 2001/10/14 joern
	Bugfixes:
	- There seems to be a strange bug in MIME::Entity or
	  Mail::Internet. The X-Mailer field of JaM is rather
	  long, ok ;) That should be no problem, but the X-Mailer
	  header field was folded strange. A folded line of
	  whitspace was added. My interpretation of the RFC is
	  that this is Ok, but some clients seems to be confused
	  by this. I don't understand where this happens, inside
	  of MIME::Entity or Mail::Internet resp. Mail::Head.
	  Mail::Head works Ok in my tests, maybe the handling of
	  the X- fields in MIME::Entity is broken.

	  Anyway. The X-Mailer field of JaM is now a few
 	  characters shorter, which avoids this strange behavior.
	  Not really a bugfix, not really a bug ;)

	  Credits for reporting this bug go to:
	  - Hrvoje Husic <husic@zyn.de>
	  - Michael Kalus <mkalus@expressvu.com>

1.0.2 2001/09/25 joern
	Features:
	- Nimda attachments are now executed directly when viewing
	  a corresponding mail. This is done inside a networked
	  VMWare session launched on the fly. You must install VMWare
	  for this feature. JaM won't start without a correctly
	  configured VMWare in the near future. So hurry up! Maybe
	  I'll support WINE, too. Stay tuned...

	Bugfixes:
	- MIME::Types does not support PNG directly. I added the
	  mime.types of Apache to JaM, which is imported.
	  Due to this bug PNG files were not attached correctly.
	- JaM now falls back to application/octet-stream/base64
	  if the MIME Type cannot be determined by MIME::Types

1.0.1 2001/09/15 joern
	Bugfixes:
	- filter reordering didn't work

1.0.0 2001/09/08 joern
	Features:
	- when adding new recipients to a mail, keep CC and BCC
	  header setting for next generated recipient

	Bugfixes:
	- recursive search in the main folder did not work.

0.9.14 2001/09/02 joern
	Features:
	- simple address book (email, name, address, phone and fax).
	  i'm planning LDAP support for enhanced address lookup, so this
	  simple version is more than enough.
	- automatic address book query when pressing enter or tab
	  in the recipients field of the mail compose window. if this
	  fails the normal default domain algorithm is used, if the
	  value doesn't contain an @ sign.

	Bugfixes:
	- if a Reply-To header was set on outgoing mails, this
	  address was added to the recipient list of that mail.

0.9.13 2001/09/02 joern
	Features:
	- when selecting last selected message in a folder, its
	  status is not changed
	- first version of a mail search window, not perfect but
	  works ok. e.g. it would be nice to see the folder
	  path of found mails.
	- mail background color is configurable
	- added a generic exception handler. internal exceptions
	  are now catched and presented in a message window. this
	  way internal errors should not crash JaM to death
	  (or at least very seldom ;).
	
	Bugfixes:
	- deleting IO filters crashed JaM
	- initial database creation did not work

0.9.12 2001/09/01 joern
	Bugfixes:
	- %$/ sh*t: I broke the Ctrl+Q stuff due a foolish bug,
	  so I push this release quickly

0.9.11 2001/09/01 joern
	If no critical bugs appear within the next week the next
	version will be 1.0.0.

	Features:
	- added File and Edit menu to the Compose Window
	- mailto and other URI links are now parsed too in the Mail widget.
	- pop3 error window
	- smtp error window
	- compose: confirm window appears only when content was changed

	Bugfixes:
	- filters which operates on the mail body crashed JaM
	  if a mail had no body.
	  NOTE: select all filters once in the IO Filter window,
	  	otherwise this bugfix wont take effect
	- deleting quoted text now works correct via Ctrl+Q
	  resp. the corresponding menu item
	- now with basic MIME word encoding on outgoing mail headers,
	  using MIME::Words, which is supposed not to be fully
	  RFC 1522 compliant. I'll check that in future.
	- the "color parents gray" bug is fixed
	- the update folder statistics bug is fixed

0.9.10 2001/08/29 joern
	Features:
	- enhanced update procedure: execute specific program
	  code for updating the database is now possible too
	  (needed for more complex data conversions which can't
	   be done with simple SQL)

	Bugfixes:
	- filters were not deleted if corresponding folders
	  were removed
	- enter key functionality in mail compose textarea was
	  broken since 0.9.9 (clearing the selected text block)
	- a folder was renamed if moved around inside the same
	  parent folder
 

0.9.9 2001/08/28 joern
	Bugfixes:
	- removed debugging output from JaM::GUI::Window
	- changed Content-Transfer-Encodiung from binary to 8Bit,
	  what's better, I think.
	- fixed date header, it was not strictly rfc822 conform.
	  the timezone was noted in abbrevation form, which was
	  not correct at least for my TZ (CEST, only north american
	  abbrevations are allowed according to rfc822). now the
	  offest format is used to represent the timezone.
	- removed hardcoded keyval's, using Gtk::Keysyms instead.

0.9.8 2001/08/20 joern
	Bugfixes:
	- suppress recipient domain expansion on emtpy fields
	- forgot adding the patches/ directory to the distribution
	- from address was added as cc when replying mails
	- if config parameter "dont_reply_adresses" was empty,
	  no recipients were added when replying mail

	Features:
	- suppress multiple window instances where it make sense:
	  - database configuration
	  - account configuration
	  - parameter configuration
	  - IO filter configuration

0.9.7 2001/08/19 joern
	Features:
	- this version ships with a patch for Gtk::HTML to support
	  the set_default_content_type() method. JaM uses it, when
	  available, to set the correct charset when viewing mail.
	  (see statement beyond regarding support of character sets
	  for outgoing/replied messages).
	  If the method is missing, mails will be displayed with
	  the standard locale charset, which may be wrong.
	  The patch is located in the patches/ directory, together
	  with a small README. I hope Ken will add this patch to the
	  next Gtk-Perl release, so we'll get this feature without
	  patching.
	- convert reply messages iso-8859-1, if the orignal message is
	  utf-8 encoded. unfortunately the i18n stuff in Gtk+ is well
	  undocumented (at least i can't find good documents, only the
	  mailing list archive with a horrible slow search frontend), so i
	  insist on iso-8859-1 for now. i hope i can change this when
	  i learned more about i18n. iso-8859-1 is ok for me, that's what
	  counts here ;)
	  JaM now needs Unicode::String to do the necessary conversions.
	- user configuation dialog. the layout of this dialog is somewhat
	  raw (can't get Label widgets aligned *sigh*), but it works.

	Info:
	- table schema is now version 3

0.9.6 2001/08/18 joern
	Bugfixes:
	- filtering was case sensitive
	- moving a folder to the top level did not work since
	  i omitted the top "Mail" folder (version 0.9.4)
	- the new Config value 'default_recipient_domain' was not
	  created by first database setup, only via updating

	Features:
	- In-Reply-To header added	
	- file selection boxes remember last selected directory
	  inside the same session. if you restart JaM the corresponding
	  configuried default value will be used again.
	- empty trash
	- deletion of the standard folders is now impossible
	- ask for saving new mail to Drafts if the composse window is
	  closed
	- writing mail based on a Draft
	- create mail templates and write mails based on templates

0.9.5 2001/08/17 joern
	Bugfixes:
	- oops, I missed it using a rfc822 compliant date for
	  outgoing mails
	- filters were only applied on the first value of
	  multi value fields
	- it was not possible to save html filtered mail
	  attachments
	- when replying to a mail with "reply all" all recipients
	  were added to the "To" header field, instead of using
	  'CC' for other recipients than the original sender.

0.9.4 2001/08/16 joern
	Bugfixes:
	- input filter were applied on outgoing mails sometimes
	- filter adding via folder and subject popup menus did
	  not work
	- path values of folders are now computed correctly,
	  when folder with childs move
	- name clashing is prevented now when creating, moving
	  and renaming folders
	- the folder "Mail" is not displayed anymore. it only
	  wastes space and can confuse if someone drops a folder
	  beside it
	
	Features:
	- you can address different .JaMrc files using the environment
	  variable JAMRC. This way you can easily uses several
	  independently instances of JaM as the same user.
	- move mails to folder
	- a default domain name for recipients can be configured
	  (if we had a dialog to do this ;). currently you must update
	  the corresponding value in the Config table.
	  Config.name='default_recipient_domain'

0.9.3 2001/08/15 joern
	New Features:
	- you can configure if pop3 messages should be deleted on
	  the server (in the account dialog)
	- "Input Filters" are now "IO Filters". you can defined
	  output filters which are applied on outgoing mail.
	- reset schema version to 1 (yet possible, because there
	  are no production installations, what will change soon ;)
	- today I throw away my Netscape Mailer

0.9.2 2001/08/14 joern
	New Features:
	- parent folders with child folders which have unread
	  mail can be colored differently. the new configuration
	  parameter pushes schema version to 2.
	- quickly adding new filter rules now via right click folder
	  popup menu. target folder will be set accordingly.
	- quickly adding new filter rules now via right click subjects
	  popup menu. target folder will be set accordingly *and*
	  toccfrom will be set to the "To:" adresse of the clicked mail.
	  this way you create mailing list filters with one click.
	- quick search via right click subjects menu for
	  - sender
	  - subject
	  - body
	  - recipient
