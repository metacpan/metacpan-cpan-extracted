=head1 NAME

App::Greple::wordle - wordle module for greple

=head1 SYNOPSIS

greple -Mwordle

=head1 DESCRIPTION

App::Greple::wordle is a greple module that implements the Wordle game.
Answer correctness is checked by regular expression.

This module supports multiple word datasets. Use the B<--data> option to
choose different word datasets such as the original Wordle word list
or the New York Times Wordle word list.

Rules are almost the same as the original game, but answers are different.
Use the B<--compat> option to get answers compatible with the original game.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 7

=item B<--data>=I<dataset>

Choose the word dataset.  Default is C<ORIGINAL>.

Available datasets:

=over 4

=item C<ORIGINAL>

The original word list from the initial Wordle game. This is the
default dataset and contains the classic Wordle word list.

=item C<NYT>

The New York Times Wordle word list, which includes words used by NYT
Wordle. This dataset is updated and may contain different words than
the original.

=back

Dataset modules are dynamically loaded from C<App::Greple::wordle::>
namespace with uppercase dataset name.

=item B<--series>=#,  B<-s>#

=item B<--compat>

Choose a different answer series.  Default is 1.  Series zero is the same as
the original game and option B<--compat> is a shortcut for
B<--series=0>.  If it is not zero, the answer set is shuffled by
pseudo-random numbers using the series number as an initial seed.

=item B<--index>=#, B<-n>#

Specify the answer index. The default index is calculated from days since
2021/06/19.  If the value is negative, you can get yesterday's
question by specifying -1.

If the specified index exceeds the available answer list, a random
answer will be selected from the dataset with a warning message.

Answer for option B<-s0n0> with C<ORIGINAL> dataset is C<cigar>.

=item B<-->[B<no->]B<result>

Show result when successful.  Default is true.

=item B<--random>

Generate a random index every time.

=item B<--trial>=#, B<-x>=#

Set the trial count.  Default is 6.

=begin comment

=item B<--answer>=I<word>

Set answer word.  For debug purpose.

=end comment

=head1 COMMANDS

A five-letter word is processed as an answer.  Other input is taken
as a command.

=over 7

=item B<h>, B<hint>

List possible words.

=item B<u>, B<uniq>

List possible words made of unique characters.

=item B<=>I<chars>

If starting with equal (C<=>), list words that include all I<chars>.

=item B<!>I<chars>

If starting with exclamation mark (C<!>), list words that do not
include any of I<chars>.

=item I<regex>

Any other string including a non-alphabetical character will be taken as a
regular expression to filter words.

=item B<!!>

Recall the word list produced by the last command execution.

=back

These commands can be connected in series.  For example, the following command
shows possible words starting with letter C<z>.

    hint ^z

The next example shows all words that do not include any letter of C<audio> and
C<rents>, and are made of unique characters.

    !audio !rents u
