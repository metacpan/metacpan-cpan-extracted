Not much to do to get this to work. 

Copy one of the "mail_dshield.pl" scripts
into a suitable directory.

Configure EITHER smtp or a sendmail equivalent.

Set your DShield UserID, and mail address

Adjust the PATH to the dshield cache directory, it
should be the same as what you've configured for the
LaBrea::Tarpit::daemon. 

Run periodically from cron, it's smart enough to delete
its old files and hang on to the ones that don't get
sent for a retry.
