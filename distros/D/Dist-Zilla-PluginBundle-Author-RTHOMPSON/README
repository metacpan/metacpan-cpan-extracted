        [Git::Check]
        allow_dirty = dist.ini
        allow_dirty = README.pod
        allow_dirty = Changes
        [Git::Commit]
        allow_dirty = dist.ini

        push_to = origin
        [Git::Remote::Check]
        remote_name = origin
        branch = master
        remote_branch = master
        [GithubMeta]

    There are several options that can change the default configuation,
    though.

OPTIONS

 -remove

    This option can be used to remove specific plugins from the bundle. It
    can be used multiple times.

    Obviously, the default is not to remove any plugins.

    Example:

        ; Remove these two plugins from the bundle
        -remove = Test::Perl::Critic
        -remove = GithubMeta

 version, version_major

    This option is used to specify the version of the module. The default
    is 'auto', which uses the AutoVersion plugin to choose a version
    number. You can also set the version number manually, or choose
    'disable' to prevent this bundle from supplying a version.

    Examples:

        ; Use AutoVersion (default)
        version = auto
        version_major = 0
        ; Use manual versioning
        version = 1.14.04
        ; Provide no version, so that another plugin can handle it.
        version = disable

 copy_file, move_file

    If you want to copy or move files out of the build dir and into the
    distribution dir, use these two options to specify those files. Both of
    these options can be specified multiple times.

    The most common reason to use this would be to put automatically
    generated files under version control. For example, Github likes to see
    a README file in your distribution, but if your README file is
    auto-generated during the build, you need to copy each newly-generated
    README file out of its build directory in order for Github to see it.

    If you want to include an auto-generated file in your distribution but
    you don't want to include it in the build, use move_file instead of
    copy_file.

    By default, both of these options are unset.

    Example:

        copy_file = README
        move_file = README.pod
        copy_file = README.txt

 synopsis_is_perl_code

    If this is set to true (the default), then the SynopsisTests plugin
    will be enabled. This plugin checks the perl syntax of the SYNOPSIS
    sections of your modules. Obviously, if your SYNOPSIS section is not
    perl code (case in point: this module), you should set this to false.

    Example:

        synopsis_is_perl_code = false

 release

    This option chooses the type of release to do. The default is 'real,'
    which means "really upload the release to CPAN" (i.e. load the
    UploadToCPAN plugin). You can set it to 'fake,' in which case the
    FakeRelease plugin will be loaded, which simulates the release process
    without actually doing anything. You can also set it to 'none' if you
    do not want this module to load any release plugin, in which case your
    dist.ini file should load a release plugin directly. Any other value
    for this option will be interpreted as a release plugin name to be
    loaded.

    Examples:

        ; Release to CPAN for real (default)
        release = real
        ; For testing, you can do fake releases
        release = fake
        ; Or you can choose no release plugin
        release = none
        ; Or you can specify a specific release plugin.
        release = OtherReleasePlugin

 archive, archive_directory

    If set to true, the archive option copies each released version of the
    module to an archive directory, using the ArchiveRelease plugin. This
    is the default. The name of the archive directory is specified using
    archive_directory, which is releases by default.

    Examples:

        ; archive each release to the "releases" directory
        archive = true
        archive_directory = releases
        ; Or don't archive
        archive = false

 vcs

    This option specifies which version control system is being used for
    the distribution. Integration for that version control system is
    enabled. The default is 'git', and currently the only other option is
    'none', which does not load any version control plugins.

 git_remote

    This option specifies the primary Git remote for the repository. The
    default is 'origin'. To disable all Git remote operations, set this to
    an empty string.

 git_branch, git_remote_branch

    This option specifies the branch that is to be checked against its
    remote. The default is 'master'. The second option, git_remote_branch,
    is only needed if the remote branch has a different name. It will
    default to being the same as git_branch.

 no_check_remote

    By default, the Git branch git_branch will be checked against the
    remote branch git_remote_branch at the remote specified by git_remote
    using the Git::Remote::Check plugin. If the remote branch is ahead of
    the local branch, the release process will be aborted. This option
    disables the check, allowing a release to happen even if the check
    would fail. This option has no effect if either git_remote or
    git_branch is set to an empty string.

 no_push

    By default, the Git repo will be pushed to the remote specified by
    git_remote after every release, to ensure that the remote repository
    contains the latest release. To disable pushing after a release, set
    this option. This option has no effect if git_remote is set to an empty
    string.

 allow_dirty

    This corresponds to the option of the same name in the Git::Check and
    Git::Commit plugins. Briefly, files listed in allow_dirty are allowed
    to have changes that are not yet committed to git, and during the
    release process, they will be checked in (committed).

    The default is dist.ini, Changes, and README.pod. If you override the
    default, you must include these files manually if you want them.

    This option only has an effect if vcs is 'git'.

 PLUGIN-SPECIFIC OPTIONS

    This bundle consumes the
    Dist::Zilla::Role::PluginBundle::Config::Slicer role, which means that
    you can specify any option to any plugin in the bundle directly by
    prefixing it with the plugin's name. This allows you to configure any
    options not covered by the above. For example, if you want to select
    "scripts" as the directory for the ExecDir plugin, you would specify
    the option as ExecDir.dir = "scripts".

BUGS AND LIMITATIONS

    This module should be more configurable. Suggestions welcome.
