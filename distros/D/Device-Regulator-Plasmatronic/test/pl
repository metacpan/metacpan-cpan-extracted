# XXX - Think of a way of testing the library
# by opening up a daemon instead of a serial port and interacting with that.
# In other words, writting a daemon that ACTS like a Plasmatronic Regulator,
# this should not be too hard, I could just add demonstration values to the
# data file, and it would be useful for other applications.
