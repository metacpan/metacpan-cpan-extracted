    - BUG FIX
    
        Even if am focusing on the core, I get many emails regarding the YouTube service.
        I therefore mainly focused on fixing the bug reports I got so far.
        
      - YouTube Video package
        - aspect_ratio was not pointing to the right value
        - is_xxx_allowed subs did not use the right order. rewritten to be a base name based setting.
          (Thanks Brian for the numerous reports)
      - YouTube package
        - change a typo in the code for get_comments_for_video_id()
      - BaseCollection is erased for now as it was not working as I expected and had a circular reference anyway.
        
    - NEW
    
      - YouTube Video package
         - change the is_xxx_allowed methods behavior. should update your code if necessary!
