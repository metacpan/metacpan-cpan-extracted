    New features:

    - improved performance when issuing many Redis commands at once
    - ->watch_keyspace now provides a Ryu::Source instance
    - latest command parameters from redis.io (ABSTTL etc. for `restore`
    and TYPE for `scan`)

    - moving-window sum

2.000     2019-06-16 22:44:26+08:00 Asia/Kuala_Lumpur
    New features:

    - now requires Future::AsyncAwait

1.014     2019-02-04 02:05:21+08:00 Asia/Kuala_Lumpur
    New features:

    - increase default buffer sizes from 8KB to 1MB, to improve efficiency
    in the common case where there are only a few active Redis connections
    - support configurable buffer sizes via `stream_read_len` / `stream_write_len`

    New examples:

    - `incr-ratelimit-aa.pl` and `consumer-groups-aa.pl` for Future::AsyncAwait basic
    examples

    Bugs fixed:

    - the example for `->subscription` was wrong, thanks to Michael Mueller for catching
    and patching!
    - retain completion Future when executing commands

1.013     2018-12-10 02:03:19+08:00 Asia/Kuala_Lumpur
    New features:

    - support for `NOACK` and type parameter for `client_kill`, as provided in
    latest Redis 5.x release

1.012     2018-10-19 11:03:35+08:00 Asia/Kuala_Lumpur
    No new features.

    Examples:

    - Improved documentation for consumer-groups.pl example
    (tested against 5.0 release)

1.011     2018-10-06 20:50:12+08:00 Asia/Kuala_Lumpur
    No new features.

    Bug fixes:

    - error handling improved, previously requests were not marked as failed
    - protocol handling for 'undef' arrays (treated as `undef` now)

    Examples:

    - consumer-groups.pl example for XADD/XREADGROUP

1.010     2018-10-06 15:26:00+08:00 Asia/Kuala_Lumpur
    New commands:

    - CLIENT ID
    - CLIENT UNBLOCK

    from Redis 5.0rc5.

1.009     2018-10-03 19:26:59+08:00 Asia/Kuala_Lumpur
    Updated to latest Redis 5.0 commands from last RC prior to 5.0 release.

1.008     2018-09-27 11:28:37+08:00 Asia/Kuala_Lumpur
    No new features.

    Bug fixes:

    - The connection was cached even if connection failed/interrupted so reconnecting
    attempts were failing as well, now the connection object will get deleted on failure
    - Subscriptions were not cancelled when the connection being interrupted,
    now they are cancelled properly

    (thanks to Eyad Arnabeh for reporting and fixing)

1.007     2018-09-05 10:11:44+08:00 Asia/Kuala_Lumpur
    No new features.

    Bug fixes:

    - Support auth parameter, rather than insisting on auth information be passed as
    part of the URI (thanks to Nael Alolwani for reporting)
    - "Pipeline depth" notifications were logged at `info` level, these are an internal
    diagnostic and not useful for application code, these are now `trace` level messages

1.006     2018-07-12 22:39:10+08:00 Asia/Kuala_Lumpur
    No new features.

    Bug fixes:

    - PSUBSCRIBE wasn't working (reported by Bill Marriott and leonerd, fix+tests by leonerd,
    I did little more than hit the merge button - thanks!)

    Dependencies:

    - Math::Random::Secure dep was missing (thanks MANWAR!)

1.005     2018-01-06 18:18:22+08:00 Asia/Kuala_Lumpur
    No new features.

    Dependencies:

    - Class::Method::Modifiers, and make sure we have a recent version of Future.pm

1.004     2017-12-29 20:10:42+08:00 Asia/Kuala_Lumpur
    No new features.

    Performance improvements:

    - DISCARD/EXEC are now pipelined, we don't need to wait for the
    write before sending more commands


1.003     2017-12-26 18:00:36+08:00 Asia/Kuala_Lumpur
    New features:

    - support queuing for MULTI and other commands
    - support for passing a Redis URI
    - minor performance improvements in protocol implementation and event handling

    Bugs fixed:

    - it was possible for cancelled/failed items within ->multi to cause the protocol
    handling to go out of sync, this is now fixed.
    - multi-word commands were generated incorrectly, these now work again

    Examples:

    - `examples/job-hash-worker.pl` - reliable priority-queue worker with job
    details in separate hash key
    - `examples/job-hash-submit.pl` - submit requests for priority-queue workers


1.002     2017-12-11 06:06:47+08:00 Asia/Kuala_Lumpur
    Dependencies:

    - Explicit Log::Any dependency to ensure that context support is available

    New features:

    - PSUBSCRIBE support

1.001     2017-12-11 05:38:20+08:00 Asia/Kuala_Lumpur
    Dependencies:

    - Added Test::HexString and Test::Deep to test deps list

    New features:

    - Support for MULTI transactions via ->multi method

    Examples:

    - `examples/job-worker.pl` - Simple list-based job queue
    - `examples/multi.pl` - Transaction using MULTI

1.000     2017-12-09 16:51:40+08:00 Asia/Kuala_Lumpur
    First stable release. Note that there are some API changes, but
    previous code should work mostly unmodified.

    New features:

    - Dropped Protocol::Redis in favour of local implementation
    - Separated out commands into an autogenerated class to make
    it easier to keep up to date with protocol changes
    - Better support for subscriptions (see `examples/pub|sub.pl`)
    - Dropped JSON::MaybeXS and Mixin::Event::Dispatch deps, events
    are now handled through Ryu

    Known issues:

    - All data is assumed to be binary, callers need their own
    Encode::encode()/::decode() calls - future versions are likely
    to include an `->encoding` setting and/or `_utf8` versions of
    string methods.
