0.07_50
  + The fail option is now named 'f' instead of 'fail'.
  + Windows colors are now explicity associated to their package.
  + Added plabels() method.
  + Save Windows color before changing it, so it can be restored.
  + Improved the 'test' file contents.
  + Supplied template renamed to TEMPLATE_T.pm.
  + t/t4.t now has "1..1" after the "ok 1", instead of the other way
    round (may have caused failing tests on some platforms; anyway, it
    was wrong the other way round).
  + Now has simpler README.
  + Moved Manual type info from Test/Usage.pm to Test/Usage/Manual.pm.

  + files() calculates total elapsed time by using the clock rather
    than by adding up subshelled times.
  + t/Foo.pm doesn't require perl 5.8.3 anymore.
  + Subshelled perl to run files() tests are now invoked with -w.
  + files() now follows symlinks. Should perhaps be an option...
