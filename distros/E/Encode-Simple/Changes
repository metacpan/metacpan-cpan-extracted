1.001     2021-12-11 14:05:59 EST
  - New module Decode::ARGV as a better alternative to the -CA option for perl.

1.000     2019-09-02 22:51:00 EDT
  - Add encode_utf8/lax and decode_utf8/lax functions that will always use the
    proper UTF-8 encoding rather than the Perl internal encoding used by these
    functions in Encode. Unicode::UTF8 will be used by these functions if
    installed. The new functions are now included as appropriate in the :strict
    and :lax export tags, as well as the new :utf8 tag, and encode_utf8 and
    decode_utf8 are exported by default as in Encode.

0.003     2019-01-24 17:07:44 EST
  - Fix Encode::Unicode test to not rely on how invalid characters are encoded,
    since this changed in Encode 2.99.

0.002     2018-02-22 21:09:15 EST
  - Promote utf8 warnings used by Encode::Unicode to exceptions in encode/decode,
    and suppress them in encode_lax/decode_lax. This brings the inconsistent API
    more in line with Encode::utf8, which does not use utf8 warnings.

0.001     2018-02-21 22:02:42 EST
  - First release
