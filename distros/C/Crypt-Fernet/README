Crypt-Fernet version 0.01
=========================

Perl extension for Fernet (symmetric encryption)

Fernet provides guarantees that a message encrypted using it cannot be manipulated or read without the key. Fernet is an implementation of symmetric (also known as “secret key”) authenticated cryptography. 
This is the Perl Implementation

EXAMPLES

   my $key = Crypt::Fernet::generate_key();
   my $plaintext = 'This is a test';
   my $token = Crypt::Fernet::encrypt($key, $plaintext);
   my $verify = Crypt::Fernet::verify($key, $token);
   my $decrypttext = Crypt::Fernet::decrypt($key, $token);

   my $old_key = 'cJ3Fw3ehXqef-Vqi-U8YDcJtz8Gv-ZHyxultoAGHi4c=';
   my $old_token = 'gAAAAABT8bVcdaked9SPOkuQ77KsfkcoG9GvuU4SVWuMa3ewrxpQdreLdCT6cc7rdqkavhyLgqZC41dW2vwZJAHLYllwBmjgdQ==';

   my $ttl = 10;
   my $old_verify = Crypt::Fernet::verify($old_key, $old_token, $ttl);
   my $old_decrypttext = Crypt::Fernet::decrypt($old_key, $old_token, $ttl);

   my $ttl_verify = Crypt::Fernet::verify($key, $token, $ttl);
   my $ttl_decrypttext = Crypt::Fernet::decrypt($key, $token, $ttl);
