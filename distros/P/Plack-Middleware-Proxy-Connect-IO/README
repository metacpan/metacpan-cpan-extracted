NAME

    Plack::Middleware::Proxy::Connect::IO - CONNECT method

SYNOPSIS

      # In app.psgi
      use Plack::Builder;
      use Plack::App::Proxy;
    
      builder {
          enable "Proxy::Connect::IO";
          enable "Proxy::Requests";
          Plack::App::Proxy->new->to_app;
      };

DESCRIPTION

    This middleware handles the CONNECT method. It allows to connect to
    https addresses.

    The middleware runs on servers supporting psgix.io and provides own
    event loop so does not work correctly with psgi.nonblocking servers.

    The middleware uses only Perl's core modules: IO::Socket::INET and
    IO::Select.

SEE ALSO

    Plack, Plack::App::Proxy, Plack::Middleware::Proxy::Connect.
