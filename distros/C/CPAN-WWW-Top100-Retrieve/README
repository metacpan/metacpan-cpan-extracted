VERSION

      This document describes v1.001 of CPAN::WWW::Top100::Retrieve - released November 06, 2014 as part of CPAN-WWW-Top100-Retrieve.

SYNOPSIS

            #!/usr/bin/perl
            use strict; use warnings;
    
            use CPAN::WWW::Top100::Retrieve;
            use Data::Dumper;
    
            my $top100 = CPAN::WWW::Top100::Retrieve->new;
            print Dumper( $top100->list( 'heavy' ) );

DESCRIPTION

    This module retrieves the data from CPAN Top100 and returns it in a
    structured format.

 Constructor

    This module uses Moose, so you can pass either a hash or hashref to the
    constructor. The object will cache all data relevant to the Top100 for
    as long as it's alive. If you want to get fresh data just make a new
    object and use that.

    The attributes are:

  debug

    ( not required )

    A boolean value specifying debug warnings or not.

    The default is: false

  ua

    ( not required )

    The LWP::UserAgent object to use in place of the default one.

    The default is: LWP::UserAgent->new;

  uri

    ( not required )

    The uri of Top100 data we should use to retrieve data in place of the
    default one.

    The default is:
    CPAN::WWW::Top100::Retrieve::Utils::default_top100_uri()

 Methods

    Currently, there is only one method: list(). You call this and get the
    arrayref of data back. For more information please look at the
    CPAN::WWW::Top100::Retrieve::Dist class. You can call list() as many
    times as you want, no need to re-instantiate the object for each query.

  list

    Takes one argument: the $type of Top100 list and returns an arrayref of
    dists.

    WARNING: list() will return an empty list if errors happen. Please look
    at the error() method for the string.

    Example:

            use Data::Dumper;
            print Dumper( $top100->list( 'heavy' ) );
            print Dumper( $top100->list( 'volatile' ) );

  error

    Returns the error string if it was set, undef if not.
