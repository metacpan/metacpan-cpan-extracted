Crypt::PassGen
--------------

This module provides a single command for generating random password
that is close enough to a real word that it is easy to remember.
It does this by using the frequency of letter combinations in 
a language (the frequency table is generated during installation
although multiple tables can be generated and used for different
languages).

This module should not be used for high security applications
(such as user accounts) since it returns passwords that are not
mixed case, have no punctuation and no letters. This word can be
used as a basis for a more secure password.

The language of the password depends on the language used to construct
the frequency table.

The source repository is on github: https://github.com/timj/perl-Crypt-PassGen

Requirements
------------

Currently assumes /usr/dict/words or /usr/share/dict/words is available so that the
frequency table can be constructed. On non-unix systems it might
be easier simply to include a dictionary for this within the
distribution. 

Also requires the Storable module.

Installation
------------

  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test
  make install

The first step may take a well since a freqeuncy table is generated
as part of the installation. If /usr/dict/words is not available
the location of a suitable dictionary must be put into the
Makefile.PL


Derivation
----------

This algorithm is based on that used in the PASSGEN program written by
Mike Bartman of SAR, Inc as part of the SPAN security toolkit in 1989.


Status
------

This is an early release of this module. It has not been tested
extensively and must be considered in alpha release.

Release Notes
-------------

V0.06   - Ensure that passwords are always the right length. In rare
          cases the loop would exit early and return a shorter password.
          Thanks to Vadim Pushtaev for the fix.

V0.05   - Fix typo in call to _scale_thirds_down preventing the
          module from working in some situations. Fix typo in call
          to _scale_seconds_down during database build
