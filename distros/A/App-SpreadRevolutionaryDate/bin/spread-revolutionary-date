=head1 NAME

spread-revolutionary-date - Spread date and time from Revolutionary (Republican) Calendar

=head1 VERSION

version 0.06

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<spread-revolutionary-date> is a L<Free Software|https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.htmlhttps://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html> that spreads the current date, expressed in L<French Revolutionary calendar|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Republican_calendar>, to various social networks: L<Twitter|https://twitter.com/>, L<Mastodon|https://mastodon.social/>, and the L<Freenode|https://freenode.net/> Internet Relay Chat network.

The French Revolutionary calendar, also called Republican calendar, was introduced during the L<French Revolution|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Revolution>, and used from late 1793 to 1805, and also during the L<Paris Commune|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Commune> in 1871. This was an attempt to get rid of religious and royalist references found in Gregorian calendar when naming measures of Time. Months were given new names based on nature, each day of the year, instead of being named after an associated saint, had a unique name associated with the rural economy: agricultural tools, common animals, grains, pastures, trees, roots, flowers, fruits, plants, and minerals. But this was also an attempt to give more rational in measuring Time, basing measures on decimal system. Instead of weeks, each month was divided into exactly 3 I<décades>, that is ten days; days were divided into ten hours; hours into 100 minutes; and minutes into 100 seconds.

You B<must> have a registering account on each of the targets you want to spread the revolutionary date. And you must get credentials for C<spread-revolutionary-date> to post on Twitter and Mastodon. Finally, you have to configure C<spread-revolutionary-date> to use these credentials, see L</CONFIGURATION> and L</"COMMAND LINE PARAMETERS"> below.

The revolutionary date and time is computed thanks to the L<DateTime::Calendar::FrenchRevolutionary> Perl module, by Jean Forget.

=head1 USAGE

  # Just execute the script in your shell
  # to spread current date to configured accounts on Twitter, Mastodon and Freenode:
  $ spread-revolutionary-date

  # Or, since this script do nothing but calling the L<App::SpreadRevolutionaryDate> Perl module,
  # use this one-liner:
  $ perl -MApp::SpreadRevolutionaryDate -e 'App::SpreadRevolutionaryDate->new->spread;'

  # Test spreading to Mastodon only:
  $ spread-revolutionary-date --mastodon --test

  # Test spreading to Twitter only in English:
  $ spread-revolutionary-date --twitter --test --locale=en

  # Spread to Twitter and Freenode explicit channels
  $ spread-revolutionary-date --twitter --freenode \
      --freenode-channels='#revolution' --freenode-channels='#acab'

=head1 CONFIGURATION

Once again: you B<have to> configure C<spread-revolutionary-date> with credentials for registered account on each of the desired targets, so it can spread the revolutionary date on behalf of these accounts.

Configuration options may also be specified as command line parameters, see L</"COMMAND LINE PARAMETERS"> below, which take precedence on options of the configuration file.

The configuration file should lie on C<~/.config/spread-revolutionary-date/spread-revolutionary-date.conf> or C<~/.spread-revolutionary-date.conf>. In case a file is found on both paths, the second one is ignored. The configuration file should use the popular L<INI file format|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INI_file>. A sample configuration file can be found in this distribution at C<etc/sample-spread-revolutionary-date.conf>.

=head2 General options

These options should appear outside of any section of the cofiguration file.

=head3 twitter

Spread on Twitter explicitly. If none of the C<twitter>, C<mastodon>, C<freenode> option is set, the revolutionary date is spread on all of these three targets.

=head3 mastodon

Spread on Mastodon explicitly. If none of the C<twitter>, C<mastodon>, C<freenode> option is set, the revolutionary date is spread on all of these three targets.

=head3 freenode

Spread on Freenode explicitly. If none of the C<twitter>, C<mastodon>, C<freenode> option is set, the revolutionary date is spread on all of these three targets.

=head3 locale

Spread with chosen language. As of L<DateTime::Calendar::FrenchRevolutionary> 0.14, locale is limited to 'en' or 'fr', defaults to 'fr'.

=head3 test

Do no not actually spread the revolutionary date, just print it on standard output for Twitter and Mastodon, and send it on configured test channels for Freenode (see <L/"test_channels"> below).

=head3 acab

Instead of spreading the current date and time, pretend that decimal time is 1:31:20 (which corresponds to 03:08:56 Paris winter time, in sexagesimal scale used by common Anglo-Babylonian Time).
