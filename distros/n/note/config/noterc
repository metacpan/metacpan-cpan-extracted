# note 1.4.1        -*- conf -*- 
#
# This  is a  sample  config  for the  note  script  There are  useful
# defaults set in note itself.
# 
# Copy it to your $HOME as .noterc
#
# Comments start with #, empty lines will be ignored.
#
# To turn on an option, set it to: 1, on or yes
# To turn off an option, set it to: 0, off or no
#
# An option  consists of an  atribute-value pair separated  by minimum
# one  space (more  spaces and/or  tabs are  allowed) and  an optional
# equal sign in between.
#
# Variable names are case in-sensitive.

# Refer to the manpage to learn more about the config

  


#
# you need  to decide which database  backend you want to  use. Please
# refer  to the  corresponding  documentation  for closer  information
# about  the certain  backend!  Currently  supported types:  "binary",
# "dbm", "mysql", "general", "dumper",  "pwsafe3" or "text".  You must
# also edit/uncomment  one section below  for the backend you  want to
# use!
dbdriver = binary



#
# BINARY backend (the default)
binary::dbname       = ~/.notedb     # filename
binary::MaxNoteByte  = 4096          # max bytes per note entry
binary::MaxTimeByte  = 64            # max bytes for the date



#
# MYSQL backend
mysql::dbhost          = localhost   # hostname
mysql::dbport          = 3306        # tcp port
mysql::dbuser          = you         # db login
mysql::dbpasswd        =             # db password
mysql::dbname          =             # database name (default: note)
mysql::encrypt_passwd  = 0           # mysql::dbpasswd is
                                     # encrypted (note --encrypt)


#
# DBM backend
dbm::directory = ~/.notedb.dbm



#
# GENERAL backend
general::dbname = ~/.notedb.txt


#
# TEXT backend
text::dbname = ~/.notedb.storable


#
# DUMPER backend
dumper::dbname = ~/.notedb.dumper



#
# Password  Safe v3  backend  Some  notes on  this  one: This  backend
# maintains encryption itself,  which is mandatory as  well. So you'll
# have to disable encryption (UseEncryption = NO)!
#
# The  Password Safe  v3  file has  its own  fields  for password  and
# username, which  note doesn't  have. To  be compatible,  the pwsafe3
# backend  parses the  note  text  for those  fields  and stores  them
# accordignly to the db:
#
# For username field: user|username|login|account|benutzer
# For passwd field: password|pass|passwd|kennwort|pw
#
# If it  doesn't find it, it  will put empty strings  into the pwsafe3
# database.
#
# The  pwsafe3  database  can  be  accessed  by  Password  Safe  (see:
# http://passwordsafe.sourceforge.net/) or  other tools  which support
# the                           format                           (see:
# http://passwordsafe.sourceforge.net/relatedprojects.shtml)
pwsafe3::dbname = ~/.notedb.psafe3


#
# You can  use encryption with  note, that means notes  and timestamps
# will be stored encrypted. This is supported by every db-backend, but
# not  the pwsafe3  backend because  this one  has builtin  encryption
# support.
UseEncryption = NO


  
#
# Specify the  encryption protocol. The appropriate  perl module needs
# to  be installed.  Possible velues  are IDEA,  DES or  Blowfish, the
# default is IDEA.

#
# You can run note always in interactive mode by simply
# typing "note". The default is: YES.

# enter. By turning this on, it  will issue a longlist command instead
# if you hit just enter.  The default is: NO

# You can use an external editor  everytime from note instead of STDIN
# for creating new notes. The default is: YES

# You can  specify your own  topic separator here.  The  default topic
# separator is a normal slash: "/"

#
# The maximum width for displaying a  note, in CHARS.  Depends on your
# screen-size. You can set it to  "auto", if you wish that note should
# determine the available size automatically.
MaxLen = auto



#
# Turn  this off  if you  dont want  note to  automatically clear  the
# screen after displaying something and after exit. The default is: NO
AutoClear = NO



#
# note can use colors for output, turn  this of, if you don't like it,
# or if your terminal does not support it. The default is: YES
UseColors = NO



#
# Color-definitions of  the various items.  Will only take  effect, if
# "UseColors" is turned on!
#
# The following colors are available: black, red, green, yellow, blue,
# magenta, cyan and white.
#
# For bold color  write it uppercase (BLACK will be  bold black).  For
# underlined  color append  an  underscore (blue_  will be  underlined
# blue).  For  inverted color append  an "I" (greenI will  be inverted
# green).
BorderColor		BLACK
NumberColor		blue
NoteColor		green

#
# Additional to  colors, you can  also do  a little bit  of formatting
# your notes (bold, underlined, italic) text. The default is: YES.
FormatText = NO



#
# You  might specify  your own  directory for  temporary files.   note
# needs to create some temp files  during editing of notes.  You could
# protect this directory using the  command: chmod 700 directory.  The
# default is: /tmp
TempDirectory = ~/tmp



#
# You can jump to a topic by  typing "cd 13" in interactive mode.  The
# deault is: NO
ShortCd = YES



#
# note can use a cached copy of the note database for list/tree/search
# this  is  currently only  supported  by  the  binary and  the  mysql
# backends, the general and text backends have an internal cache.  The
# default is: NO
Cache = NO



#
# You can define your very own time format for time stamps
# YY   - the last 2 digits of a year
# YYYY - year
# MM   - month
# DD   - day
# hh   - hours
# mm   - minutes
# ss   - seconds
# This is the default: (18.10.2000 21:32:08)

#
# You can make  note readonly which is useful for  database copies The
# default is: NO

# Note  may separate  titles and  topics using  horizontal lines  when
# listing them. You can turn on this behavior by setting PrintLines to
# YES.  The default is: NO

# Add  a hash  to identify  notes. Such  a hash  will persist  several
# importy/export cycles and makes each single note unique.
