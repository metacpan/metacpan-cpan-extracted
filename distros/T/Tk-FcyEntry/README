Tk-FcyEntry
========================

This module is deprecated.

It once served the purpose to replace the standard Perl/Tk Entry widget in order to reflect the Entry's state.
This is standard behavior of an Entry widget by now, so you can just use a plain Entry widget (at least, in Tk 800.x).
