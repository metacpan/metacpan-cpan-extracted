=head1 NAME

Data::Unixish::cat - Pass input unchanged

=head1 VERSION

This document describes version 1.574 of Data::Unixish::cat (from Perl distribution Data-Unixish), released on 2025-02-24.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

In Perl:

 use Data::Unixish qw(lduxl);
 my @res = lduxl("cat", 1, 2, 3, 4); # => (1, 2, 3, 4)

=head1 FUNCTIONS


=head2 cat

Usage:

 cat(%args) -> [$status_code, $reason, $payload, \%result_meta]

Pass input unchanged.

This function is not exported.

Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

=over 4

=item * B<in> => I<array>

Input stream (e.g. array or filehandle).

=item * B<out> => I<any>

Output stream (e.g. array or filehandle).


=back

Returns an enveloped result (an array).

First element ($status_code) is an integer containing HTTP-like status code
(200 means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second element
($reason) is a string containing error message, or something like "OK" if status is
200. Third element ($payload) is the actual result, but usually not present when enveloped result is an error response ($status_code is not 2xx). Fourth
element (%result_meta) is called result metadata and is optional, a hash
that contains extra information, much like how HTTP response headers provide additional metadata.

Return value:  (any)

=head1 CONTRIBUTING


To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull requests on
GitHub.

Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You can
simply modify the code, then test via:

 % prove -l

If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally on your
system), you can install L<Dist::Zilla>,
L<Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR>,
L<Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR>, and sometimes one or two other
Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps required beyond
that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
