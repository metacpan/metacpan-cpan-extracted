Revision history for MasonX-Maypole

Change log
==========

0.32 Sun May 22, 23:15:00 2005
    - view class now defaults to MasonX::Maypole::View

0.31 Wed May 18, 19:46:00 2005
    - fixed the package declaration in MasonX::Maypole::Application

0.3  Mon May 16, 17:35:00 2005
    - Fixed important bug where MasonX::Maypole::send_output() wasn't transferring 
        headers_out from the Maypole request to the Apache request
    - Ugh. The bug in 0.223 isn't fixed, just the warning.
    - Removed extra warnings from View.pm
    - Added MasonX::Maypole::Application until MP::App gets patched.

0.223  Mon May 16, 17:30:00 2005
    - it seems that Apache's register_cleanup method should not return undef. 
        Who knew? Anyway, now returning 1 in the register_cleanup call in 
        MasonX::Maypole::View::template(). This fixes an obscure bug where 
        template vars were not getting cleaned up at the end of each request. 
        It also fixes an annoying warning about using undefined variables, but 
        without any file name or line number to find the damned thing. 

0.222  Wed Apr 13, 13:30:00 2005
    - added init anf flags sections to maypole.css to prevent Mason from 
        wrapping the css content, and to ensure the file is served with 
        the correct content type.

0.221  Fri Apr  8, 15:00:00 2005
    - slight modification to frontpage template to remove extra title
    - added information about beerdb demo at http://beerdb.riverside-cms.co.uk

0.220 Thur Apr  7, 03:20:00 2005
    - fixed a couple of bugs in maybe_link_view template
    - edited header template to place maypole.css in /css
    - updated example httpd.conf and BeerDB.pm

0.219  Sun Feb 20, 18:03:00 2005
    - changed send_output() to add a component root based on the model moniker, rather 
        than the table name. In most cases these will be identical. 
    - fixed a bug where all custom component roots were compiled in the same subdirectory 
        of the Mason data dir, thus breaking the ability of different versions of the 
        same template to be called for different tables (mreece). Can't figure out why 
        this never affected me, since it's pretty fundamental to the whole thing. 

0.218  Tues Feb 15, 15:40:00 2005
    - fixed bug in search_form template ($element->{tag} should be $element->tag)

0.217  Fri  Feb 11, 11:55:00 2005
    - fixed links in frontpage template 

0.216  Thur Feb 10, 22:30:00 2005
    - added Makefile.PL (was just Build.PL before)
    - fixed typo in synopsis (mreece)
    - fixed bug caused by not initialising the masonx config slot (mreece)

0.215  Wed Dec 15, 15:00:00 2004
    - fixed bug in pager template

    - applied patch to view template, splitting part of it out into the
        new view_item template

0.212  Wed Dec 8, 13:15:00 2004
    - applied patch to button template, to check if action is_public

0.211  Tue Dec 7, 17:30:00 2004

0.21   Tue Dec 7, 14:00:00 2004
