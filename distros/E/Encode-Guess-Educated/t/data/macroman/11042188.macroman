 §2§ Abstract §2§

   The yeast IA[3] polypeptide consists of only 68 residues, and the free
   inhibitor has little intrinsic secondary structure. IA[3] showed
   subnanomolar potency toward its target, proteinase A from Saccharomyces
   cerevisiae, and did not inhibit any of a large number of aspartic
   proteinases with similar sequences/structures from a wide variety of
   other species. Systematic truncation and mutagenesis of the IA[3]
   polypeptide revealed that the inhibitory activity is located in the
   N-terminal half of the sequence. Crystal structures of different forms
   of IA[3] complexed with proteinase A showed that residues in the
   N-terminal half of the IA[3] sequence became ordered and formed an
   almost perfect &#x3b1;-helix in the active site of the enzyme. This potent,
   specific interaction was directed primarily by hydrophobic interactions
   made by three key features in the inhibitory sequence. Whereas IA[3]
   was cut as a substrate by the nontarget aspartic proteinases, it was
   not cleaved by proteinase A. The random coil IA[3] polypeptide escapes
   cleavage by being stabilized in a helical conformation upon interaction
   with the active site of proteinase A. This results, paradoxically, in
   potent selective inhibition of the target enzyme.

   Aspartic proteinases participate in a variety of physiological
   processes, and the onset of pathological conditions such as
   hypertension, gastric ulcers, and neoplastic diseases may be related to
   changes in the levels of their activity. Members of this proteinase
   family, e.g. renin, pepsin, cathepsin D, and human immunodeficiency
   virus-proteinase are generally type-cast on the basis of their
   susceptibility to inhibition by naturally occurring, small molecule
   inhibitors such as the acylated pentapeptides, isovaleryl- and
   acetyl-pepstatin. However, the two most recently identified human
   aspartic proteinases, &#x3b2;-site Alzheimer's precursor protein cleavage
   enzyme and &#x3b2;-site Alzheimer's precursor protein cleavage enzyme 2
   ([42]1, [43]2), are not inhibited by this classical type of inhibitor
   of this family of enzymes. Pepstatins are metabolic products produced
   by various species of actinomycetes and, as such, are not themselves
   gene-encoded. Protein inhibitors of aspartic proteinases are relatively
   uncommon and are found in only a few specialized locations ([44]3).
   Examples include renin-binding protein in mammalian kidneys which
   intriguingly has now itself been identified to be the
   enzyme,N-acetyl-d-glucosamine-2-epimerase ([45]4); a 17-kDa inhibitor
   of pepsin and cathepsin E from the parasite, Ascaris lumbricoides
   ([46]5); proteins from plants such as potato, tomato, and squash
   ([47]6, [48]7), and a pluripotent inhibitor from sea anemone of
   cysteine proteinases as well as cathepsin D ([49]8).

   The IA[3] polypeptide in yeast is an 8-kDa inhibitor of the vacuolar
   aspartic proteinase (proteinase A or saccharopepsin) that was initially
   described by Holzer and co-workers ([50]9). The complete sequence of
   this 68-residue inhibitor has been elucidated ([51]10, [52]11) and the
   inhibitory activity of IA[3] has been shown to reside within the
   N-terminal half of the molecule ([53]10, [54]12). We have recently
   solved the structure of the IA[3]-proteinase A complex ([55]12),
   demonstrating that whereas free IA[3] has little intrinsic secondary
   structure, residues 2–32 of the inhibitor, upon contact with proteinase
   A, become ordered and adopt a near perfect &#x3b1;-helical conformation
   occupying the active site cleft of the enzyme. This was the first
   crystal structure to be determined for a gene-encoded aspartic
   proteinase inhibitor complexed with its target enzyme. It was thus
   considered important to investigate further the role of the proteinase
   as a folding template and to attempt to establish the molecular
   features that enable this unprecedented mode of inhibitor-proteinase
   interaction to occur.

 §2§ EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES §2§

 §5§ Protein Production and Purification §5§

   Proteinase A and other aspartic proteinases were obtained, and peptides
   were synthesized by solid-phase methods, as described previously
   ([58]12). Genomic DNA was extracted from S. cerevisiae and the gene
   encoding IA3 was amplified specifically by polymerase chain reaction
   (PCR)^1 using 5&#x2032;-GCATATGAATACAGACCAACAAAAAGTG-3&#x2032; and
   5&#x2032;-GCTCGAGCTCCTTCTTATGCCCCGC-3&#x2032; as forward and reverse primers.
   Mutations were introduced into the wild type sequence to generate
   clones encoding the chimera, (Gly)[9] and K7M proteins (Table[59]I) by
   using the respective forward primers: chimera,
   5&#x2032;-GGAGATATACATATGGGAGGACACGACGTCCCTTTAACAAACATATTTCAGAGCTCA-3&#x2032;;
   (Gly)[9], 5&#x2032;-GCATATGGGAGGAGGCGGCGGCGGTGGAGGAGGCATATTTCAGAGCTCA-3&#x2032;; and
   K7M, 5&#x2032;-GCATATGAATACAGACCAACAAATGGTGAGCGAA-3&#x2032; in conjunction with the
   wild type reverse primer described above. The constructs encoding the
   K24M, K31M/K32M, Mix, D22L, and K18M/D22L mutants were each generated
   in two steps by overlapping PCR mutagenesis ([60]13) using the
   mutagenic primer sets: K24M, forward,
   5&#x2032;-GGCGATGCAATGGTAGTGAGTGACGCTTTT-3&#x2032; and reverse,
   5&#x2032;-ACTCACTACCATTGCATCGCCCTGCAATTT-3&#x2032;; K31M/ K32M: forward,
   5&#x2032;-TTTATGATGATGGCCAGTCAAGACAAGGACGGC-3&#x2032; and reverse
   5&#x2032;-ACTGGCCATCATCATAAAAGCGTCACTCACTACCTT-3&#x2032;; Mix: forward,
   5&#x2032;-AAGGCCGATAAATTTTCAATGGCTAGTCAAGACAAGG-3&#x2032; and reverse,
   5&#x2032;-TGAAAATTTATCGGCCTTCACTACCTTTGCATCGCC-3&#x2032;; D22L: forward,
   5&#x2032;-CAGGGGCTGGCCAAGGTAGTGAGTGACGCTTTT-3&#x2032; and reverse,
   5&#x2032;-TACCTTGGCCAGCCCCTGCAACTTTTCCTTTGA-3&#x2032;; K18M/D22L: forward,
   5&#x2032;-GAAATGTTGCAGGGGCTGGCCAAGGTAGTGAGTGACGCTTTT-3&#x2032; and reverse,
   5&#x2032;-ATCCTTGGCCAGCCCCTGCAACATTTCCTTTGAGCTCTGAAA-3&#x2032;. The second set of
   overlap primers utilized the T7 forward primer and the wild type
   reverse primer described above.

   Table I

   Interactions between yeast proteinase A and protein forms of IA[3]

   Wild type and mutant forms of IA3 were subcloned into theNdeI-XhoI
   sites of pET-22b ([63]Novagen, Cambridge, United Kingdom), thus
   introducing a C-terminal Leu-Glu-His[6]tag. Escherichia coli strain
   BL21DE3(pLysS) was transformed with wild type or mutant clones, then
   grown at 37&#x2009;°C in LB medium to an A [600] of &#x223c;0.6 before induction with
   1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-&#x3b2;-d-galactopyranoside. Each soluble recombinant
   protein was loaded onto a nickel-chelate affinity column in 0.05 m
   sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, containing 0.3 m NaCl, washed with the
   same buffer adjusted to pH 6.0 containing 10% glycerol and each protein
   form of IA[3] was eluted with the glycerol containing buffer at pH 4.0.
   Appropriate fractions containing IA[3] were then heated twice at 100&#x2009;°C
   for 5 min.

 §5§ Analytical Measurements §5§

   N-terminal sequencing of wild-type and mutant forms of IA[3] was
   performed by automated Edman degradation on protein bands that were
   electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane following
   SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 20% gels. Samples for amino
   acid analysis were hydrolyzed for 16 h at 105&#x2009;°C in 6 m HCl before
   being loaded onto a Biochrom 20 amino acid analyzer (Amersham Pharmacia
   Biotech, Cambridge, UK). MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry was carried out
   using a PE Biosystems Voyager Elite XL instrument incorporating a UV
   laser and delayed extraction. Samples at &#x223c;10 pmol/&#x3bc;l were added to a
   matrix solution consisting of ferulic acid (55 mg/ml in ethanol
   containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) in a sample/matrix ratio of 3:1.

 §5§ Kinetic Measurements and Peptide Cleavage §5§

   Inhibition assays were conducted at pH 3.1 and 4.7 as described
   previously ([64]12, [65]14) using Lys-Pro-Ile-Glu-Phe*NitroPhe-Arg-Leu
   (where the asterisk indicates the scissile peptide bond) as substrate
   for all enzymes except yapsin 1 ([66]15). For this enzyme, the
   substrate used was ACTH (residues 1–39). This was incubated at 37&#x2009;°C in
   50 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.3, with 10 units of purified yapsin 1
   ([67]15) for 30 min in the absence and presence of peptide 1 at final
   concentrations up to 20 &#x3bc;m. The proteolytic product from ACTH (residues
   1–15) was detected and quantified by reverse phase high performance
   liquid chromatography.

   The susceptibility of peptide/protein forms of IA[3] to proteolytic
   cleavage was examined by incubation at 37&#x2009;°C for various lengths of
   time (commonly 16 or 72 h) with the appropriate enzyme in 100 mm sodium
   formate/acetate buffers at pH 3.1/4.7, respectively, each containing
   300 mm NaCl. Each synthetic peptide was incubated initially with
   proteinase A for 16 h at a molar ratio of 40:1 and, if no cleavage was
   detected under these circumstances, then the incubation was repeated at
   a peptide:proteinase ratio of 10:1 for 72 h. Peptide 1 was incubated
   with nontarget proteinases such as human pepsin at both pH 3 and 5 at a
   molar ratio of 1,000:1 for only 1 h. Each digest was separated by
   reverse-phase fast protein liquid chromatography using a Pep-RPC column
   (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Bucks, United Kingdom) and the fractions
   containing any cleavage products were collected and subjected to acid
   hydrolysis followed by amino acid analysis. Protein samples were frozen
   for storage prior to subsequent mixing with the matrix solution for
   application to a stainless steel target and analysis by MALDI-TOF mass
   spectrometry.

 §5§ Crystallography and Molecular Modeling §5§

   Crystals of a complex of proteinase A with the K24M mutant protein form
   of IA[3] (Table [68]I) were grown by vapor diffusion under the
   conditions described previously for other IA[3]-proteinase A complexes
   ([69]12). The initial solution was prepared at a molar ratio of
   inhibitor:proteinase of 5:1, and after separation from the excess of
   inhibitor by gel filtration on Sephadex G-50, was concentrated to 5
   mg/ml by ultrafiltration. The mother liquor contained 30% PEG1500, 0.14
   m ammonium sulfate in 0.1 m MES buffer, pH 6.0. Data extending to 1.9 Å
   were collected at 100 K on beamline X9B at NSLS, Brookhaven National
   Laboratory, Upton, NY, using an ADSC 4K CCD detector. Data were
   processed with HKL2000 ([70]16). The initial data set consisted of
   217,446 reflections that could be scaled withR [sym] of 8.7% (last
   shell 34.6%) to yield 41,718 unique measurements. The completeness was
   92.8% for the whole data and 75.5% for the final shell. The structure
   of proteinase A complexed with peptide 1 ([71]12) was used as the
   initial model with replacement of Lys^24 by Met. The structure was
   refined with CNS 1.0 ([72]17) utilizing data extending to 2.0-Å
   resolution. The first two rounds of refinement included positional and
   B factor refinements and model adjustment, while solvent molecules were
   added in the third round. The final model contained the enzyme,
   residues 2–31 of the inhibitor and 243 water molecules. The final R
   factor was 19.84% and R [free] was 23.1%. The root mean square
   deviations for bond lengths and bond angles from ideality was 0.012 and
   1.59 Å, respectively.

   Modeling calculations were made on a Silicon Graphics Octane with a
   single R12000 processor using the Moloc modeling package. Individual
   amino acid side chains (K18M/D22L) in IA[3] were changed with a
   built-in function in Moloc. Side chain conformations were adapted
   manually and a subsequent round of optimization, maintaining proteinase
   A and the remainder of IA[3] fixed, resulted in low energy
   conformations for the newly introduced side chains. The new
   protein-inhibitor complex was checked for attractive and repulsive
   interactions, and allowed conformations, respectively.

 §2§ RESULTS AND DISCUSSION §2§

 §5§ Interaction of Protein/Peptide Forms of IA[3] with Target and Nontarget
Enzymes  §5§

   The nucleotide sequence encoding all 68 residues of IA[3] was amplified
   by PCR and introduced into the pET-22b vector for expression in E. coli
   as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The recombinant protein
   that accumulated in E. coli was soluble and was purified to homogeneity
   from cell lysates by taking advantage of the His[6] tag introduced from
   the pET-22b vector at the C terminus of the IA[3] polypeptide chain
   (see “Experimental Procedures”). N-terminal analysis of one batch of
   the homogeneous wild-type inhibitor through 10 cycles of Edman
   degradation gave the sequence Asn-Thr-Asp-Gln-Gln-Lys-Val-Ser-Glu-Ile,
   which is exactly coincident with that predicted by the DNA sequence for
   residues 2–11 (Table [75]I) ([76]11) and indicates that the initiator
   Met^1 residue had been removed during the accumulation of this batch of
   recombinant protein in E. coli. Analysis of a separate batch of
   recombinant wild-type inhibitor by MALDI-TOF mass spectometry gave a
   mass of 8772 Da, identical with that predicted (8772 Da) for the
   IA[3]sequence plus the C-terminal extension of
   &#x223c;Leu-Glu-His[6]introduced from the pET-vector.

   The K [i] value determined at pH 3.1 for the inhibition of yeast
   proteinase A by this C-terminal tagged, wild-type recombinant protein
   (wild-type in Table [77]I) was comparable to that reported previously
   at the same pH for the naturally occurring protein purified from S.
   cerevisiae ([78]14). It is readily apparent then that the introduction
   of the extra &#x223c;Leu-Glu-His[6] residues at the C terminus of the
   recombinant inhibitor did not have any significant detrimental effect
   on inhibitory potency. Since the target proteinase is unlikely ever to
   encounter a pH as low as 3.1 in its cellular environment, attempts were
   also made to determine inhibition constants at higher pH values such as
   4.7 and 6.0. In both cases, the interaction with proteinase A was so
   tight that theK [i] values lay at or beyond the limits of accurate
   determination using the available assay methodology and so were
   estimated to be <0.1 nm.

   A synthetic peptide which spanned residues 2–34 of the IA[3]sequence
   (Peptide 1 in Table [79]II) was found to have inhibitory potency
   against yeast proteinase A at pH 3.1 and 4.7 comparable to those of the
   naturally occurring and wild-type recombinant protein forms of IA[3],
   described previously ([80]12,[81]14). In contrast, peptide 1, at a
   concentration of 2 &#x3bc;m, had no significant ability to inhibit any one of
   a number of other aspartic proteinases from a wide range of other
   species (Table[82]III). These have considerable sequence and structural
   similarities to yeast proteinase A and included yapsin 1 (a
   membrane-attached aspartic proteinase also from S. cerevisiae ([83]15)
   and other enzymes of fungal, mammalian, parasite (plasmepsin II from
   Plasmodium falciparum ([84]18) and plant (cyprosin from Cynara
   cardunculus ([85]19)) origin. Thus, IA[3] is a potent specific
   inhibitor directed solely against its target enzyme, yeast proteinase
   A. Since peptide 1 had no effect on the nontarget enzymes listed in
   Table [86]III, reciprocally, the effect of a number of these (including
   e.g. human pepsin, cathepsin D, and cathepsin E) on peptide 1 was
   examined. With human pepsin, for example, using a molar ratio of
   peptide 1:pepsin of 1,000:1 at pH 3.1 and pH 5, peptide 1 was cleaved
   rapidly at the &#x223c;Glu^10* Ile^11&#x223c; and &#x223c;Ala^29*Phe^30&#x223c; bonds, as revealed
   by amino acid analysis of the collected peptide fragments (data not
   shown). Identical results were obtained for the other enzymes so it
   would appear that peptide 1 is unable to inhibit the nontarget aspartic
   proteinases such as pepsin, cathepsins D and E (and the other enzymes
   listed in Table [87]III) because these enzymes cut the polypeptide
   effectively as a substrate. Consequently, the &#x223c;Ala^29*Phe^30&#x223c; and
   &#x223c;Glu^10*Ile^11&#x223c; sites that were cleaved by the nontarget proteinases
   were changed singly and in concert to introduce residues at the P[1]
   position which were known from extensive previous studies (e.g. Refs.
   [88]20 and [89]21) to be refractory to cleavage by such enzymes as
   human pepsin and cathepsin D. The resultant peptides (2 and 3, Table
   [90]II) were just as potent as peptide 1 as inhibitors of proteinase A
   but still showed no significant ability to inhibit, e.g. human pepsin
   or cathepsin D at concentrations as high as 5 &#x3bc;m. Although cleavage of
   peptides 2 and 3 between residues &#x223c;Val^29-Phe^30&#x223c; and &#x223c;Lys^10-Ile^11&#x223c;
   plus &#x223c;Val^29-Phe^30&#x223c;, respectively, was no longer evident,
   nevertheless, cleavage at other locations now became apparent. For
   example, after incubation of peptide 3 with human cathepsin D at pH
   3.1, the digest was analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and the
   large product that was detected (3238 Da observed; 3237 Da predicted)
   indicated that cleavage had occurred between residues &#x223c;Gln^5*Gln^6&#x223c; to
   generate the fragment spanning residues 6–34. Thus, peptides 1, 2, and
   3 appeared to be cleaved by the nontarget proteinases including human
   pepsin and cathepsin D at whatever peptide bonds were accessible and
   which met the sub-site specificity requirements of each enzyme.

   Table III

   Aspartic proteinases unaffected by the IA[3] inhibitor

   In contrast, peptides 1, 2, and 3 were not cleaved by proteinase A (at
   pH 3.1 or 4.7), even upon prolonged incubation for 3 days at 37&#x2009;°C at
   molar ratios of peptide:proteinase A as low as 5:1. Similarly, the
   recombinant, wild-type protein form of IA[3] (Table [95]I) was not
   cleaved by yeast proteinase A since the mass ion (8772 Da) observed by
   MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry after prolonged incubation was identical to
   that of the starting material. However, the wild-type protein was
   digested by pepsin and cathepsin D, e.g. analysis of the material
   incubated at pH 3.1 with human cathepsin D indicated that one large
   product had accumulated which was consistent in size (5575 Da observed;
   5578 predicted) with that of a fragment spanning residues Phe^30-Glu^68
   plus the &#x223c;Leu-Glu-(His)[6] tag. Thus the full-length protein form of
   IA[3] also appears to be degraded by nontarget proteinases with
   cleavage taking place, at least, at one of the bonds (&#x223c;Ala^29*Phe^30&#x223c;)
   that was identified earlier for peptide 1 (no attempts were made to
   detect by mass spectrometry any small products from the N terminus of
   IA[3] in the cathepsin D digest). This ready susceptibility of IA[3] in
   both peptide and protein forms to proteolytic cleavage by nontarget
   enzymes provides further substantiation to our conclusion described
   previously ([96]12) that the free IA[3] polypeptide has little
   intrinsic secondary structure.

 §5§ Truncation and Mutagenesis of IA[3] §5§

   Since the inhibitory activity of IA[3] toward proteinase A appeared to
   be contained within residues 2–34 (compare K [i]values for the
   wild-type protein form (Table [97]I) and the peptide form (peptide 1,
   Table [98]II)), the effect on inhibitory potency of further truncation
   of this sequence was examined using a systematic series of synthetic
   peptides in which residues were successively deleted from the N and C
   termini. Removal of Asn^2 had little effect on theK [i] value measured
   at pH 3.1 (compare peptide 4 with peptide 1, Table [99]II) but the
   potency was diminished somewhat at pH 4.7, as a K [i] value was readily
   quantified for peptide 4 at this pH value (Table [100]II). Similarly,
   deletion of residues 3–6 progressively diminished inhibitory potency
   (peptides 5 and 6, Table[101]II) and the absence of residues 2–11 (in
   peptide 7) resulted in almost complete abolition of the inhibitory
   activity. The activity of IA[3] was totally destroyed when residues
   2–15 were lacking (peptide 8, Table [102]II). The residues at the
   N-terminal end of the 2–34 polypeptide sequence would thus appear to
   contribute substantially to the potency of inhibition.

   To investigate the importance of the individual side chains of these
   residues, alterations in sequence were introduced into the full-length
   protein form of IA[3] at its N terminus by PCR mutagenesis as described
   under “Experimental Procedures.” Initially, residues 2–10 of the
   wild-type IA[3] sequence were replaced with
   Gly-Gly-His-Asp-Val-Pro-Leu-Thr-Asn. This is the sequence of residues
   that is present at the N terminus of the target enzyme, yeast
   proteinase A itself ([103]22) and, as such, was chosen totally
   arbitrarily. The recombinant, chimera inhibitor was purified to
   homogeneity and 10 cycles of Edman degradation yielded the sequence
   Gly-Gly-His-Asp-Val-Pro-Leu-Thr-Asn-Ile, identical to that predicted by
   the DNA sequence, and indicating once again that the initiator Met^1
   residue had been removed by E. coli proteinases. Consistent with this,
   analysis by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry gave a mass of 8502 Da,
   identical to that (8502 Da) predicted for the sequence of residues 2–68
   plus the &#x223c;Leu-Glu-His[6] tag of the chimeric protein. Remarkably, this
   chimeric protein with 9/34 (26%) of its residues exchanged was still
   almost as effective as an inhibitor as the wild-type protein, with its
   interaction at pH 4.7 still being so tight as to lie at or beyond the
   limits of accurate determination (Table [104]I). This result, together
   with the deletion experiments described above with the peptide form of
   IA[3], suggests that, for effective inhibition, backbone atoms
   contributed by residues 2–10 are essential but that the (side chain)
   identity of the individual amino acids in these positions is of lesser
   importance. On this basis, we replaced residues 2–10 of the natural
   sequence with nine glycine residues ((Gly)[9]mutant, Table [105]I) and
   purified the resultant protein to homogeneity. No attempts were made to
   sequence this protein because of the plethora of glycine residues but
   MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry gave a mass of 8124 Da, identical to that
   (8124 Da) predicted by the nucleotide sequence but, once again, lacking
   the initiator Met^1 residue. The yield of this mutant protein obtained
   from E. coli was about 5-fold lower than that obtained for the
   wild-type (and other mutant) sequence(s). This drastic introduction of
   nine consecutive glycine residues resulted in a poorer inhibitor with a
   K [i] of 40 nm at pH 3.1 (Table [106]I). However, at pH 4.7, the
   (Gly)[9] mutant protein was still a very effective inhibitor, with its
   potency quantified at around 1 nm (Table [107]I). Thus, the main chain
   atoms at the N terminus of the 2–34 sequence would appear to be the
   major contributors to inhibitory potency from this region with only
   minor influences being introduced by the individual residue side
   chains. This was substantiated further by replacement of individual
   residues, for example, the Lys^7 residue was replaced with methionine
   which is quasi-isosteric with lysine but lacks the &#x3b5;-NH[2] group. This
   K7M mutant inhibitor was just as potent as the wild-type protein (Table
   [108]I).

   Truncation of the inhibitory sequence of residues 2–34 at its C
   terminus also resulted in a progressive loss of inhibitory potency
   (compare peptide 1 and peptides 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13, Table [109]II).
   Replacement of Lys^24 by Met (K24M mutant) and Lys^31 + Lys^32
   (together) in the double mutant K31M/K32M again had no significant
   effect on the inhibitory potency of the resultant inhibitors toward
   proteinase A (Table [110]I). The structure of the K24M mutant complexed
   with proteinase A was solved at 2-Å resolution and refined to an R
   factor of 19.84% (see “Experimental Procedures”). Comparison with the
   structures reported previously ([111]12) for the K31M/K32M protein form
   and for the peptide 1 form of IA[3] complexed with proteinase A
   (Protein Data Bank accession codes [112]1dp5 and [113]1dpj) revealed
   that, in all three cases, residues 2–32 of the inhibitor had adopted a
   near-perfect &#x3b1;&#x2212;helical conformation in the active site cleft of the
   enzyme. Electron density was only observed for these residues in all 3
   structures and the root mean square deviation between the C&#x3b1;
   coordinates was 0.224 between the protein and peptide form(s) of the
   inhibitor. The IA[3]helix is amphipathic with the charged residues
   including Lys^24 located on one face, protruding into solvent
   (Fig.[114]1).

   Figure 1

   The helical conformation adopted by residues 2–32 of IA[3] upon
   interaction with the active site of proteinase A. The sequence shown is
   that of the K31M/K32M mutant, depicting the distribution of selected
   hydrophilic and hydrophobic residues on opposite faces of the
   amphipathic helix.

   The structures all reveal that the main chain carbonyl and amido
   moieties of residues 2–10 of the IA[3] polypeptide are involved in
   H-bond formation with one another within the helix of the inhibitor but
   the side chains of these residues make no significant contacts with the
   proteinase, with the exception of Val^8which is involved in hydrophobic
   interactions (described later). In the sequence of the chimera
   inhibitor described earlier (Table [119]I), Val^8 was replaced with Leu
   which may be able to make hydrophobic contacts with the enzyme
   requiring only minor re-adjustment so that the derived K [i] value was
   not significantly perturbed. The binding energy of these contacts is
   clearly lost in the (Gly)[9] mutant protein but since the side chains
   of all of the other residues in the 2–10 sequence point largely into
   solvent, the still considerable inhibitory potency of the
   (Gly)[9]mutant (Table [120]I) can be readily understood. The
   predominant requirement in this N-terminal region appears to be for the
   backbone atoms to satisfy the H-bonding arrangement within the
   inhibitory helix, thereby stabilizing the helix by providing a somewhat
   lengthy “cap.”

   A comparable extended “capping” arrangement exists at the C-terminal
   end to stabilize the inhibitory helix. No electron density was observed
   for the side chains of any residues beyond Lys^32 in the crystal
   structure of the K24M mutant complex or in the structure of peptide 1
   complexed with proteinase A described previously ([121]12) and the side
   chain of residue 32 makes no significant contacts with the enzyme. Yet
   the most potent inhibition (subnanomolar at pH 4.7) was measured when
   the IA[3] sequence was extended at its C terminus beyond Lys^32. This
   was achieved by the inclusion of Nle^33 (a synthetic isostere of the
   natural Met residue at this location) and Ala^34 in peptide 1 (Table
   [122]II) or by introducing a C-terminal Lys^32 amide (peptide 9-NH[2],
   Table [123]II) to stabilize the part of the inhibitor helix necessary
   for interaction with the proteinase by dissipation of the negative
   charge from the macromolecular dipole. The contribution of the main
   chain amido groups in satisfying the H-bonding arrangements at this end
   of the helix is substantiated by the increased potencies that were
   measured when each peptide terminated in a C-terminal amide instead of
   the free COOH group (compare peptides 9-NH[2], 10-NH[2] and 11-NH[2]
   with 9, 10, and 11, respectively, Table [124]I). A peptide that
   consisted only of residues 2–28 had lost essentially all of its
   inhibitory potency (peptide 12, Table[125]II) and residues 2–26
   (peptide 13) were not active at all as an inhibitor.

 §5§ Hydrophobic Clusters §5§

   Peptide 14 and peptide 8 (Table [126]II) together span the entire
   sequence of residues 2–34. Neither of these “half-sized” peptides was
   able to inhibit proteinase A when added singly or in combination with
   each other at a variety of molar ratios. Thus a contiguous sequence is
   necessary for IA[3] to inhibit proteinase A by forming the amphipathic
   helix (Fig. [127]1). The residues located on the hydrophobic face make
   extensive hydrophobic contacts with cognate residues in proteinase A.
   Particularly noticeable in this regard (Fig. [128]1) is the “cluster”
   arrangement of Val^8-X-X-hydrophobic-Phe^12toward the front end of the
   helix and Val^26-X-X-hydrophobic-Phe^30at the back end of the
   inhibitory sequence. In the front end cluster, replacement of Val^8 or
   Ile^11 individually by Ala had minor effects on inhibitory potency
   (compare peptides 15 and 16 with peptide 9, Table [129]IV). However,
   deletion of the benzene ring of phenylalanine at position 12 resulted
   in a considerably larger drop in potency in the resultant
   Ala-containing peptide (peptide 17, Table [130]IV), emphasizing the
   importance of van der Waals interactions of this benzene ring with its
   hydrophobic environment (Fig. [131]2). The peptide carrying the double
   replacement of V8A together with F12A (peptide 18, Table [132]IV) had
   lost much of its inhibitory potency and the double mutant peptide
   containing &#x223c;Ala^11-Ala^12&#x223c; (peptide 19) was virtually ineffective as an
   inhibitor, even at pH 4.7. The triple mutant in which all three of the
   front-end cluster residues were changed to &#x223c;Ala^8-X-X-Ala^11-Ala^12&#x223c;
   (peptide 20, Table [133]IV) was completely inactive as an inhibitor.

   Figure 2

   Stereo representation of the interactions made by the side chains of
   Val^8 and Phe^12 in the IA[3] polypeptide with cognate hydrophobic
   residues in proteinase A. Proteinase A residues are green while the
   Val^8 and Phe^12 side chains and the appropriate segment of the IA[3]
   helical backbone are inbrown.

   A similar response was quantified when the residues contributing to the
   &#x223c;Val^26-X-X-hydrophobic-Phe^30&#x223c; cluster at the back end of the helix
   were replaced. Substitution of Phe^30 by Ala, Gly, or Lys (compare
   peptides 21 and 22/23 with peptide 10, Table [140]IV) resulted in a
   significant loss in potency, again emphasizing the contribution to
   binding by appropriate positioning of the large benzene ring of the
   side chain of Phe^30. In contrast, replacement of Val^26 by Ala did not
   diminish inhibitory potency. Rather, it appeared to improve the binding
   interaction at pH 3.1 marginally (peptide 24, Table [141]IV).
   Replacement of the -CH[3] side chain of Ala with the -CH[2]-COOH side
   chain of an Asp at position 26 diminished the inhibitory potency at pH
   4.7 by about 70-fold (compare peptides 25 and 24, Table [142]IV),
   commensurate with the introduction of a hydrophilic side chain into a
   hydrophobic environment. However, theK [i] value measured at pH 3.1 for
   peptide 25 was tighter than that derived at pH 4.7 (Table [143]IV). Of
   all the inhibitors listed in Tables [144]I, [145]II, and [146]IV, this
   was the only occasion when such an effect was observed and most likely
   is a reflection of the Asp side chain in its protonated and therefore
   uncharged form being less unfavorable in its contact with the
   hydrophobic environment offered by the enzyme.

   The double mutant peptide carrying the V26D/F30K substitutions was
   completely ineffective as an inhibitor (peptide 26, Table [147]IV),
   indicating that introduction of two hydrophilic, charged residues was
   highly unfavorable since there are no H-bond partners available in the
   enzyme to compensate for desolvation of the two side chain functions.
   However, amphipathic helices are often stabilized by electrostatic
   interactions between residues at positions i andi + 4 ([148]23) and,
   indeed exactly such a salt bridge is present between the Lys^24 and
   Asp^28 residues on the hydrophilic face of the IA[3] helix when
   complexed with its target proteinase (Fig. [149]1). However, the
   attempt to encourage Asp^26 and Lys^30 to interact with one another to
   form an additional salt bridge in the V26D/F30K double mutant peptide
   was clearly not tolerated on the hydrophobic face of the amphipathic
   helix in the active site cleft of the enzyme. A further mutant was also
   constructed in which the sequence of
   &#x223c;Ser^27-Asp^28-Ala^29-Phe^30-Lys^31-Lys^32&#x223c; was shuffled to
   &#x223c;Lys^27-Ala^28-Asp^29-Lys^30-Phe^31-Ser^32&#x223c; in the protein form of the
   IA3 inhibitor (Mix in Table [150]I). In this arrangement, Val^26 was
   retained but the salt bridge between Lys^24 and Asp^28 on the
   hydrophilic face of the helix was disrupted and the crucial Phe^30
   residue was replaced by lysine, as in peptide 23. The resultant mutant
   protein (Mix, in Table [151]I) was purified to homogeneity from E.
   coliand found to have a K [i] value at pH 4.7 comparable to that
   observed for the single F30K mutant peptide (peptide 23, Table[152]IV).
   This might be interpreted to indicate that the salt bridge interaction
   between Lys^24 and Asp^28 on the hydrophilic surface of the IA[3] helix
   is, not unexpectedly, weak.

 §5§ Central Residues in the Inhibitor Helix §5§

   The “centerpiece” of the inhibitory 2–34 residues of IA[3] is the
   &#x223c;Lys^18-Leu^19-X-X-Asp^22&#x223c; sequence. In the three crystal structures of
   the K24M and K31M/K32M mutant proteins and peptide 1 forms of IA3
   complexed with proteinase A, the &#x3b5;-NH[2] group of Lys^18 of the
   inhibitor hydrogen bonds to one of the carboxyl oxygens of Asp^32 of
   the enzyme (Fig. [153]3). This is one of the two catalytic Asp residues
   that operate the catalytic mechanism of all aspartic proteinases
   ([154]24). The &#x3b5;-NH[2] group of Lys^18 also hydrogen bonds to one of
   the carboxyl oxygens of the side chain of Asp^22 in the IA[3]
   inhibitory sequence (Fig. [155]3). The other oxygen of the side chain
   COOH of Asp^22 hydrogen bonds to the phenolic OH group of Tyr^75 in the
   enzyme, a residue that is totally conserved in all eukaryotic aspartic
   proteinases and which is positioned almost at the tip of the &#x3b2;-hairpin
   loop or flap that overlays the active site cleft in these enzymes. A
   network of interactions thus cross-links these charged residues of
   IA[3]with the catalytically essential and structurally conserved
   residues of the target enzyme (Fig. [156]3). When the charged side
   chain of Asp^22 in the full-length protein form of IA[3] was replaced
   with the hydrophobic but otherwise almost isosteric side chain of a
   leucine residue, the purified D22L mutant protein had a slightly
   reduced potency both at pH 3.1 and 4.7 (Table [157]I) but nevertheless
   was still an effective inhibitor.

   Figure 3

   Stereo representation of the interactions made by the
   &#x223c;Lys^18-Leu^19-X-X-Asp^22&#x223c; centerpiece residues of IA[3] in the
   vicinity of the active site of proteinase A. Proteinase A residues are
   ingreen with the catalytic water molecule depicted as ablue sphere. The
   side chains of Lys^18, Leu^19, and Asp^22 plus the relevant segment of
   the IA[3] helix backbone are in brown. Hydrogen bonding distances are
   shown.

   However, when Lys^18 was changed to Met in concert with the D22L
   mutation, the resultant inhibitor (K18M/D22L, Table [162]I) was an
   extremely potent inhibitor. For the first time in all of these studies,
   it was not possible to derive an accurateK [i] value at pH 3.1 because
   the protein-protein interaction was so tight. This may be a reflection
   of the increased propensity of Met and Leu residues to be accommodated
   within a helical conformation by comparison with their wild-type Lys
   and Asp counterparts. Alternatively, this may be a further indication
   of the importance of hydrophobic contributions to binding strength.
   Modeling studies suggest that the side chain of a methionine at
   position 18 in the IA[3] sequence is surrounded by the hydrophobic side
   chains of Ile^30, Tyr^75, Thr^111, Phe^112, Phe^117, and Ile^120 of
   proteinase A, as well as the newly introduced side chain of Leu^22 in
   the K18M/D22L double mutant inhibitor. The side chain of Leu^22 can
   make potential, favorable interactions with C-&#x3b2; of Ser^35 and the side
   chains of Ile^73 and Tyr^75 from the flap of proteinase A, as well as
   with the Met^18 and Val^25 residues of the IA[3] inhibitory sequence.

   The importance of hydrophobic interactions was further corroborated
   when the Leu^19 residue within the &#x223c;Lys^18-Leu^19-X-X-Asp^22&#x223c;
   centerpiece was changed to Ala in the peptide form of IA[3]. The
   resultant peptide (peptide 27, Table [163]IV) was no longer an
   inhibitor at pH 3.1 and an apparent inhibition constant of 700 nm was
   estimated at pH 4.7. This loss in potency (compare peptides 27 and 9,
   Table [164]IV) was the largest observed for any single amino acid
   replacement. However, when peptide 27 was incubated with proteinase A
   for 16 h at pH 4.7 and 37&#x2009;°C at a molar ratio of 40:1, it was cleaved
   as a substrate (as monitored by reverse phase fast protein liquid
   chromatography, not shown). Peptide 27 is thus a good alternative
   substrate at pH 4.7 and was giving only an apparent inhibition of the
   activity of proteinase A toward the chromogenic substrate used in the
   inhibition assays. The deletion of the terminal isopropyl moiety of the
   leucine side chain thus converted a highly potent polypeptide inhibitor
   into a regular substrate of proteinase A by decreasing affinity to the
   target enzyme and possibly by reducing internal helix stability.

   Under the same conditions, peptides 14 and 8 (Table [165]II) which
   together span the 2–34 sequence of IA[3] were both cleaved by
   proteinase A (at the &#x223c;Glu^10*Ile^11&#x223c; and &#x223c;Ala^29*Phe^30&#x223c; bonds,
   respectively) as reported previously ([166]12). Peptide 7, despite
   having been synthesized deliberately to position a valine in place of
   the natural Ala^29 residue (Table [167]II) and thus make the
   potentially vulnerable &#x223c;Ala^29*Phe^30&#x223c; peptide bond resistant to attack
   (as in peptides 2 and 3, see earlier), was still cleaved albeit very
   slowly (50% in 16 h) upon incubation at pH 4.7 with proteinase A at a
   molar ratio of 40:1. Since cleavage at the mutated &#x223c;Val^29–Phe^30&#x223c; bond
   was no longer an option, it was found by amino acid analysis that
   processing had taken place at the adjacent &#x223c;Phe^30*Lys^31&#x223c; bond (data
   not shown). Similarly, peptides 12 and 13 (Table [168]II) were digested
   after 72 h incubation with proteinase A at a molar ratio of 10:1, as
   were peptides 18, 19, 20, and 26 of the peptides listed in Table
   [169]IV. Thus, in addition to the L19A mutant (peptide 27) as described
   above, the other peptides (7, 8, 12, 13, 14 (Table [170]II), 18, 19,
   20, and 26 (Table [171]IV)) which were not effective as inhibitors of
   proteinase A, served instead as substrates for the enzyme.

   From all of these data, it is readily apparent that the inhibitory
   capacity of IA[3] is located within residues 2–34 of the sequence and
   that these residues need to be present as a contiguous polypeptide to
   achieve inhibition. The inhibitory sequence of residues is not cleaved
   by the target enzyme but only very subtle alterations in sequence are
   necessary to convert the IA[3] polypeptide into a substrate for
   proteinase A. In contrast, however, the wild-type polypeptide is
   readily hydrolyzed as a substrate by nontarget aspartic proteinases
   such as pepsin and cathepsin D, which have substantial similarity to
   proteinase A in their primary sequences and three-dimensional
   structures ([172]25-27). This substantiates our NMR and CD findings
   reported previously ([173]12) that free IA[3] in its peptide or protein
   forms is predominantly unstructured. The interaction of IA[3] with its
   target enzyme appears to depend critically on the insertion of three
   hydrophobic “pins” (the front-end cluster, Leu^19 and the back end
   cluster) into the appropriate hydrophobic sockets proferred by the
   active site cleft of proteinase A. The target enzyme thus plays the
   role of a helper template, stabilizing the amphipathic helical
   conformation of IA[3] but, paradoxically, resulting in its own
   inhibition. In contrast, the random coil IA[3] polypeptide is
   apparently unable to locate the critical pins sufficiently precisely in
   its interaction with the nontarget aspartic proteinases. Consequently,
   since aspartic proteinases generally require only 7 or 8 amino acid
   residues of a polypeptide to bind in an extended &#x3b2;-strand conformation
   in their active site to act as a substrate, the nontarget enzymes are
   readily able to cleave IA[3]. Thus, the “default” setting is cleavage
   of the random coil IA[3]polypeptide. In contrast, helication requires
   many more stringent conditions to be fulfilled such as complementary
   amphipathicity, precision of shape, and the correct juxtaposition of
   side chains possessing the appropriate properties to fit snugly into
   the hydrophobic pockets of proteinase A. Only if IA[3] can be sculpted
   in situ to become the key that matches precisely into the lock that is
   the active site of proteinase A, can the IA[3] polypeptide escape
   cleavage and preserve its integrity. Thus, in its interaction with this
   aspartic proteinase, IA[3]is stabilized in the somewhat abnormal
   helical conformation, shaped by the proteinase itself but yet at the
   same time, held clear of the catalytic machinery through formation of
   the helix. The alternative, as a consequence of any imprecision of fit,
   is recognition in an extended conformation and cleavage.

   The present study has thus afforded considerable insight into the
   features that are important in governing the potency and selectivity of
   inhibition of proteinase A by IA[3]. This presents a fascinating
   challenge for future investigation to determine whether this
   unprecedented mode of inhibitor-enzyme interaction can be exploited to
   generate selective inhibitors re-targeted against other aspartic
   proteinases including those produced by pathogenic organisms.
