        properties, they are now deprecated.

0.80	*** INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES ***
        The QooxdooJsonrpc plugin does not install a /source
        path automatically anymore ... there were too many problem
        with other parts of the application which would need special
        attention to work with relative requests coming from a different
        'path' ... starting with this version, there are now two
        environment variables that govern source mode:

        QX_SRC_MODE=1 will enable serving your application from
        ../frontend/source ... 

        QX_SRC_PATH=/where/ever/source allows to specify some other 
        directory to serve your application from.

0.76    - require mojo 0.34 to make sure we don't run into
          trouble with old versions.

        - ship index.html without redirecting to it ... 
          this makes for nicer urls

        - simplify plugin code a little by using get method when
          setting up routes

0.75    - make plugin in development mode creative in finding
          the qooxdoo source code and contrib downloads

0.72    Sat Mar 26 2011
        - send requests and results to log at debug level
        - new module Mojolicious::Plugin::QooxdooJsonrpc makes writing
          applications even simpler. Included support for serving
          both the production and the source version of the application

0.71    Tue Mar 22 2011
        - add utf8 to content_type

	*** INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES ***

        - the service module has to explicitly tell which
          of its methods are to be called remotely via the

          check_access, mojo_session and mojo_stash by their actual names
