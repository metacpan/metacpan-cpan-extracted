NAME
    Log::Fine - Yet another logging framework

SYNOPSIS
    Provides fine-grained logging and tracing.

        use Log::Fine;
        use Log::Fine::Levels::Syslog;                # exports log levels
        use Log::Fine::Levels::Syslog qw( :masks );   # exports masks and levels

        # Build a Log::Fine object
        my $fine = Log::Fine->new();

        # Specify a custom map
        my $fine = Log::Fine->new(levelmap => "Syslog");

        # Get the name of the log object
        my $name = $fine->name();

        # Use logger() to get a new logger object.  If "foo" is not
        # defined then a new logger with the name "foo" will be created.
        my $log = Log::Fine->logger("foo");

        # Get list of names of defined logger objects
        my @loggers = $log->listLoggers();

        # Register a handle, in this case a handle that logs to console.
        my $handle = Log::Fine::Handle::Console->new();
        $log->registerHandle( $handle );

        # Log a message
        $log->log(INFO, "Log object successfully initialized");

DESCRIPTION
    Log::Fine provides a logging framework for application developers who
    need a fine-grained logging mechanism in their program(s). By itself,
    Log::Fine provides a mechanism to get one or more logging objects
    (called *loggers*) from its stored namespace. Most logging is then done
    through a logger object that is specific to the application.

    For a simple functional interface to the logging sub-system, see
    Log::Fine::Utils.

  Handles
    Handlers provides a means to output log messages in one or more ways.
    Currently, the following handles are provided:

    * Log::Fine::Handle::Console
        Provides logging to `STDERR' or `STDOUT'

    * Log::Fine::Handle::Email
        Provides logging via email. Useful for delivery to one or more pager
        addresses.

    * Log::Fine::Handle::File
        Provides logging to a file

    * Log::Fine::Handle::File::Timestamp
        Same thing with support for time-stamped files

    * Log::Fine::Handle::Syslog
        Provides logging to syslog

    See the relevant perldoc information for more information. Additional
    handlers can be defined to user taste.

  Formatters
    A formatter specifies how Log::Fine displays messages. When a message is
    logged, it gets passed through a formatter object, which adds any
    additional information such as a time-stamp or caller information.

    By default, log messages are formatted as follows using the Basic
    formatter object.

         [<time>] <LEVEL> <MESSAGE>

    For more information on the customization of log messages, see
    Log::Fine::Formatter.

INSTALLATION
    To install Log::Fine:

      perl Makefile.PL
      make
      make test
      make install

METHODS
    The Log::Fine module, by itself, provides getters & setter methods for
    loggers and level classes. After a logger is created, further actions
    are done through the logger object. The following two constructors are
    defined:

  new
    Creates a new Log::Fine object.

    Parameters
    A hash with the following keys

    * levelmap
        [default: Syslog] Name of level map to use. See Log::Fine::Levels
        for further details

    * no_croak
        [optional] If set to true, then do not croak when _error is called.

    * err_callback
        [optional] If defined to a valid CODE ref, then this subroutine will
        be called instead of _fatal when _error is called.

    Returns
    The newly blessed object

  listLoggers
    Provides list of currently defined loggers

    Parameters
    None

    Returns
    Array containing list of currently defined loggers

  levelMap
    Getter for the global level map.

    Returns
    A Log::Fine::Levels subclass

  logger
    Getter/Constructor for a logger object.

    Parameters
    * logger name
        The name of the logger object. If the specified logger object does
        not exist, then a new one will be created.

    Returns
    an Log::Fine::Logger object

  name
    Getter for name of object

    Parameters
    None

    Returns
    String containing name of object, otherwise undef

  _error
    Private internal method that is called when an error condition is
    encountered. Will call _fatal unless `{no_croak}' is defined.

    This method can be overridden per taste.

    Parameters
    message
        Message passed to confess.

  _fatal
    Private internal method that is called when a fatal (non-recoverable)
    condition is encountered. Calls confess with given error message.

    While this method can be overridden, this is generally not advised.

    Parameters
    message
        Message passed to confess.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
    I'd like the thank the following people for either inspiration or past
    work on logging: Josh Glover for his work as well as teaching me all I
    know about object-oriented programming in perl. Dan Boger for taking the
    time and patience to review this code and offer his own suggestions.
    Additional thanks to Tom Maher and Chris Josephs for encouragement.
