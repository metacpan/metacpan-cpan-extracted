NAME
    Object::BlankStr - Object which stringifies to empty string ("")

VERSION
    version 0.05

SYNOPSIS
     use Object::BlankStr;

     die Object::BlankStr->new; # dies without printing anything

     # checking exception the right way
     eval { die rand() > 0.5 ? Object::BlankStr->new : "blurg" };
     my $eval_err = $@;
     if ($eval_err || ref($eval_err)) {
        ...
     }

     # checking exception the WRONG way, object is stringified to "" and becomes
     # false
     eval { die rand() > 0.5 ? Object::BlankStr->new : "blurg" };
     if ($@) {
        ...
     }

DESCRIPTION
    Object::BlankStr is just an empty object which stringifies to "" (empty
    string). Since it is an object, it has a boolean true value (but be
    careful with stringification, see SYNOPSIS).

    So far the only case I've found this to be useful is for die()-ing
    without printing anything. If you just use 'die;' or 'die "";' Perl will
    print the default "Died at ..." message. But if you say 'die
    Object::BlankStr->new;' Perl will die without printing anything.
