VCS::SCCS
    An attempt to convert SCCS files to something more modern

DESCRIPTION
    SCCS (Source Code Control System) is a historical and maybe even
    obsolete VCS (Version Control System).

    CSSC is the GNU Project's replacement for SCCS.

    This interface aims at the possibility to read those files,
    without the need of the sccs utility set, and open up to the
    possibility of scripts that use it to convert to more modern
    VCSs like git, Mercurial, or subversion.

PREREQUISITES
    perl-5.6.x

    Converted our own repositories with perl version 5.6.2, 5.8.x-dor
    and 5.10.0. Should work fine with all newer perl releases.

BUILDING AND INSTALLATION
    As all CPAN modules:
	# perl Makefile.PL
	# make test
	# make install

USING IT
    Start with the documentation, so you get a grasp of what can and
    cannot be done

    $ perldoc VCS::SCCS

    If you want to dive into the deep, and simply convert your current
    SCCS folder tree to git, use examples/sccs2git-r which recursively
    scans down from the current directory for SCCS repositories and
    merges them down into a single git repository

    $ cd /my/src/project/
    $ perl /path/to/VSC-SCCS/examples/sccs2git-r
    $ git status

    If you plan to do more conversions, change the first line of the
    file examples/sccs2git-r to reflect the location of your perl binary
    and install it into somewhere in your $PATH and make it executable.
    The call `perl Makefile.PL` will ask you to install this script.
