NAME
    Judy - Library for creating and accessing dynamic arrays

DESCRIPTION
    The Judy family of functions supports fully dynamic arrays. These arrays
    may be indexed by a 32- or 64-bit word (depending on processor word
    size) (Judy::1, Judy::L), a null terminated string (Judy::SL), or an
    ordinary perl string (Judy::HS).

    Judy arrays are both speed- and memory-efficient, with no tuning or
    configuration required, across a wide range of key set types
    (sequential, periodic, clustered, random). Judy's speed and memory usage
    are typically better than other data storage models such as skiplists,
    linked lists, binary, ternary, b-trees, or even hashing, and improves
    with very large data sets.

    The memory used by a Judy array is nearly proportional to the population
    (number of elements).

    Since an initial (empty) Judy array is represented by a null pointer, it
    is possible to construct an array of Judy arrays. In other words, a Judy
    array's Values can be pointers to other Judy arrays. This makes it very
    simple to construct an array with an arbitrary number of dimensions or
    Index sizes.

    The libJudy author believes JudyHS is a good replacement for a hashing
    method when resizing the hash table is done during population growth. A
    correctly tuned hash method with a static hash table size and population
    is unbeatable for speed. However, Judy::HS will perform better than a
    hashing method with smaller and larger populations than the optimum hash
    table size. JudyHS does not have a degenerate performance case where
    knowledge of the hash algorithm can be exploited. (I.E. JudyHS does not
    use a linked list to handle hash collisions, it uses a tree of JudyL
    arrays and a virtual hash table size of 4 billion).

SYNOPSIS
    Judy::1:
        This can be thought of as a bit vector. For a comparison between
        Judy::1 and "vec" in perlfunc, take a look at
        <http://perlmonks.org/?node_id=732843>.

            # Turn the 43rd bit on. A bit like:
            #
            #   vec( $str, 42, 1 ) = 1
            #
            Judy::1::Set(
                $judy_1,
                42
            );

    Judy::L
        Maps an integer to another integer. This is sort of like a very
        compact perl hash where the only allowed keys and values are
        integers.

            # A bit like:
            #
            #   $array[ 42 ] = 9000
            #
            Judy::L::Set(
                $judy_l,
                42,
                9000
            );

    Judy::SL
        Maps null terminated strings to integers.

            # A bit like:
            #
            #   $hash{world} = 9000
            #
            Judy::SL::Set(
                $judy_sl,
                'world',
                9000
            );

    Judy::HS
        Maps perl strings to integers.

            # A bit like:
            #
            #   $hash{world} = 9000
            #
            Judy::HS::Set(
                $judy_sl,
                'world',
                9000
            );

Multi-dimensional Judy::L/Judy::SL/Judy::HS Arrays
    Storing a pointer to another Judy::L array in a Judy::L array's Value is
    a simple way to support dynamic multi-dimensional Judy::L arrays. These
    arrays (or trees) built using Judy::L arrays are very fast and memory
    efficient. (In fact, that is how JudySL and JudyHS are implemented). An
    arbitrary number of dimensions can be realized this way. To terminate
    the number of dimensions (or tree), the Value pointer is marked to NOT
    point to another Judy array. A "Judy::JLAP_INVALID" flag is used in the
    least significant bit(s) of the pointer. After the flag
    "Judy::JLAP_INVALID" is removed, it is used as a pointer to the users
    data.

    Note: The current version of Judy.h changed this flag from 0x4 to 0x1 to
    allow for a malloc() that does not deliver memory on an 8 byte aligned
    boundry (such as old v algrind).

    The following example code segment can be used to dive into a
    multi-dimensional Judy::L using an API similar to Tye McQueen's
    Data::Diver. This makes a Judy::HS object and looks past the public API
    as an example of a multi-dimensional Judy::* structure.

        # For kicks, allocate a Judy::HS object and look inside it a
        # little bit.
        use Judy::HS;
        Judy::HS::Set( my ($judy), 'abcd', 42 );
        Dive( $judy, 4 );

        use Judy;
        use Judy::L;
        sub Dive {
            my ( $judy, @walk ) = @_;
        
            my ( $pvalue, $value );
            for my $key ( @walk ) {
                return if ! $judy;
            
                # Advance to next dimension.
                ( $pvalue, $value ) = Judy::L::Get( $judy, $key );
            
                # Check if pointer to user buffer
                last if $value & Judy::JLAP_INVALID;
            
                $judy = $value;
            }
        
            if ( $value & JLAP_INVALID ) {
                # Remove our flag.
                $value &= ~ Judy::JLAP_INVALID;
            
                # Return the value.
                printf "User object pointer is 0x%x at 0x%x\n", $value, $pvalue;
            }
            else {
                warn sprintf "Judy::* object pointer is 0x%x at 0x%x\n", $value, $pvalue;
            }
            return ( $pvalue, $value );
        }

    Note: This works because malloc() guarantees to return a pointer with
    the least bit(s) == 0x0. You must remove JLAP_INVALID before using the
    pointer.
