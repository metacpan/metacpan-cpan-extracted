Revision history for MooseX-AttributeShortcuts

0.032     2017-06-13 21:59:13 CDT-0500
	* Move builder method name generation into its own method, provided by the
	  common 'HasAnonBuilder' role, to allow for easier overriding when
	  organizations decide to use non-standard builder method names that
	  cannot be handled by changing the traits' "builder_prefix" option.

0.031     2017-05-30 22:32:27 CDT-0500
	* Fix tests to run without '.' in @INC; fixes #17.
	* Additional tests, documentation, and examples.

0.030-TRIAL  2017-05-08 22:58:52 CDT-0500
	* Move our attribute trait out into its own file.
	* Anonymous builder methods for attributes in roles are now created at the
	  time the attribute is defined in the role, not when the role (attribute)
	  is applied to a class.  That is, using 'builder => sub { ... }' in a
	  role will result in the role having the builder method.  Because of
	  this, we can now treat those methods like other role methods: aliasing,
	  excluding, etc.

0.029     2017-05-08 22:53:18 CDT-0500
	* Redo a number of tests, to improve coverage and deal with the IMPENDING
	  DOOM of . in @INC
	* Add a "history" note referencing lazy_build
	* Additional metaclass/trait application tests
	* Add a 'trigger_method' attribute, to stash away the expected name of the
	  method our generated trigger will call in the associated class
	* Use List::Util instead of List::AllUtils+List::MoreUtils (thanks,
	  ether! #15)
	* Clarify some points in the documentation (thanks, Olaf! #10)
	* Drop some older methods: mi(), strengthen/weaken_value()

0.028     2015-04-07 20:45:00 PDT-0700
	* 0.028.  *le sigh*

0.027_02  2015-04-07 20:43:17 PDT-0700
	* Moose 1.14 is now the minimum supported Moose.

0.027_01  2015-03-28 22:02:17 PDT-0700
	* Break out our $_process_options into more... succinct... methods.
	* Add Moo-style type constraints.

0.027     2015-03-10 19:27:06 PDT-0700
	* Stop using autobox, after relentless persecution by The Cabal ;)
	* Push out our warnings for those using undocumented bits, as we haven't
	  released a non-dev/trial version in *ages*

0.026-TRIAL  2014-12-02 19:52:59 PST-0800
	* Keep our comments dumb, even in tests. (thanks, @haarg!)

0.025-TRIAL  2014-05-22 12:51:25 PDT-0700
	* This is a TRIAL release, as I'm not entirely sure of the wisdom and
	  implementation of the following.
	* Allow for the creation of additional associated methods by hijacking the
	  delegation system, a la native traits: handles => { ... => sub { ... } }

0.024     2014-05-02 12:50:57 PDT-0700
	* Make the undocumented isa_* options "deprecated" ...which seems like
	  better karma than no warning, as people really shouldn't be using these
	  anyways, but better nice than to have it done to me someday :)

0.023     2014-04-04 21:23:33 PDT-0700
	* Add isa_instance_of attribute option.

0.022     2013-09-29 00:08:39 PDT-0700
	* No code changes -- released with refreshed test suite

0.021     2013-09-08 23:32:09 PDT-0700
	* Drop MXCPA entirely, and incorporate the subtyping functionality

0.020_01  2013-08-26 13:33:44 PDT-0700
	* Keep MXCPA quiet, for now.  This is evil (hence the dev release), but
	  should keep things status-quo until we properly integrate MXCPA
	  functionality into MXAS proper.

0.020     2013-08-19 21:51:02 PDT-0700
	* Bump CoercePerAttribute version requirement to 1.000 and update docs

0.019     2013-04-20 21:50:05 PDT-0700
	* Better support inline subtyping and coercions (people who are inclined
	  to shoot themselves in their foot will do it regardless)
	* Additional tests for coercions

0.018     2013-01-09 10:20:25 PST8PDT
	* ~~ TRIAL ~~
	* If a constraint coderef is given and coercion is requested, we now copy
	  the parent type's coercions to the anonymous child type.
	* Better document the constraint option and how it interacts with simple
	  coercion.

0.017     2012-10-28 20:53:52 PST8PDT
	* make actually make classes immutable during tests
	* add initial primitive anonymous inline subtyping support; this needs to
	  be evaluated with the outstanding pull request (issue #6) but I need
	  this Right Now

0.016     2012-09-08 21:41:38 America/Los_Angeles
	* provide for "negative shortcuts" for clearer and predicate, but don't
	  document for the moment

0.015     2012-08-26 11:48:29 America/Los_Angeles
	* add 'builder => sub { ... }' shortcut [gh #4]

0.014     2012-08-16 17:26:09 America/Los_Angeles
	* explictly test for definedness rather than truthiness when determining
	  if someone has also specified a default along with is => lazy

0.013     2012-07-15 22:11:37 America/Los_Angeles
	* Restore tests lost from (d11e67a) -- no functional / code changes!

0.012     2012-05-02 11:02:10 America/Los_Angeles
	* TRIAL/dev release
	* Don't try to guess what sort of metaclass we need; just die if we don't
	  have one
	* Misc cleanups

0.011     2012-04-30 13:41:05 America/Los_Angeles
	* TRIAL/dev release
	* Handle the no-metaclass case in our init_meta()

0.010     2012-04-06 18:25:42 America/Los_Angeles
	* Minor doc updates; no functional changes from 0.009 (TRIAL)

0.009     2012-03-26 23:46:58 America/Los_Angeles
	* Drop 'init_arg => undef' from our 'ro => "lazy"' shortcut.  This was
	  done in coordination with the author of Moo, based on consistently
	  surprised user feedback.

0.008     2012-01-10 23:05:34 America/Los_Angeles
	* Prebuild our roles, for better caching (and fewer warnings, at least)

0.007     2012-01-10 17:30:57 America/Los_Angeles
	* Allow default to be also be specified when is => lazy

0.006     2011-10-27 10:15:07 America/Los_Angeles
	* We now handle "trigger => 1", as well
	* All our tests are wrapped in Test::Moose::with_immutable(),
	  just to make sure that we immutablize properly

0.005     2011-08-18 20:54:02 America/Los_Angeles
    * handle attribute extension/cloning, for realz this time
    * we now handle the case of attributes defined in roles by properly
      applying our trait to the applied_attribute metaclass

0.004     2011-08-02 23:44:20 America/Los_Angeles
    * add lazy_build => 'private'
    * our laziness was being ignored when an attribute defined in one class
      was being extended/cloned in another class -- this could not stand

0.003     2011-07-03 16:40:19 America/Los_Angeles
    * handle predicate => 1, clearer => 1 as well

0.002     2011-03-30 23:43:11 America/Los_Angeles
    * Convert our trait to a parameterized role, to allow for different
      build and writer prefixes (e.g. '_set_' vs '_')
    * Cause 'is => "lazy"' to behave the way it does in Moo
    * Change the default writer prefix from _ to _set_; it was pointed out
      that this is the expected way to do things (and makes more sense,
      really).

0.001     2011-03-27 08:12:11 America/Los_Angeles
    * initial release
