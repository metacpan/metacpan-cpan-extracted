DESCRIPTION
    This is the guts of ICal::QuickAdd, of interest to developers. Most
    users probably want the docs of iqa instead, which is a script which
    uses this module.

  new()
      $iqa = ICal::QuickAdd->new('tomorrow at noon. Lunch with Bob') ;

      # Default to expecting a email message with the SMS in body, On STDIN
      $iqa = ICal::QuickAdd->new();

  parse_date_and_summary()
       $iqa->parse_date_and_summary($msg);

    Takes a string, such as short SMS text, and parses out a date and event
    summary from it.

    Right now it's sort of dumb. It expects the event description to come
    first, followed by a period, and then a summary. Example:

     tomorrow at noon. Lunch with Bob

    The dot was chosen as the delimiter because my cell phone allows me to
    type it directly, using the "1" key.

    Limitations: A future version should also return an "$is_date" flag, to
    note if the date found was a date or a date and time.

  inject_into_ics()
        $iqa->inject_into_ics($filename);

    Injects a valid ical event block into the env entry into the end of
    $filename, which is assumed to be a valid iCalendar file. If that
    assumption is wrong, the file could be corrupted. Use the is_ical_file()
    to check first!

    Bugs: Currently always injects a Unix newline. This could corrupt an ICS
    file with with CRLF line entries.

  parsed_string()
     my $desc = $iqa->parsed_string;

    Return a short description. Useful for confirming to the user how the
    Quick Add string was parsed.

    Limitations: the description returned currently always includes
    hours/minute compontent and is in 24 hour time.

  as_vevent()
     my $vevent = $iqa->as_vevent;

    Return a Data::ICal::Entry::Event object representing the event.

    For now, hard-code a one hour duration

  as_ical()
     my $data_ical = $iqa->as_ical;

    Returns a Data::ICal object with the "PUBLISH" method set.

    The PUBLISH method is used when mailing iCalendar events.

  as_ical_email()
     my $email_simple_obj = $iqa->as_ical_email(
            To    => $your_regular_email,
            From  => $from_email, # Defaults to $iqa->from_email
      );

    Returns a ready-to-mail Email::Simple object with an iCalendar body.
    Extra headers can be passed in.

  from_email()
    Returns the 'from' email address. It can also be used as a check to see
    if the SMS came from an email at all, since will only be set in that
    case.

  from_email_obj()
    If the input was an email, returns the object representing the incoming
    message. Currently a Mail::Audit object.

  get_msg()
     Return the event name found in the SMS message.

  get_dt()
    Returns DateTime object found in SMS.
