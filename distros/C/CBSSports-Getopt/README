NAME
    CBSSports::Getopt - Encapsulate Option Parsing and Usage for all
    CBSSports Perl Scripts

VERSION
    1.1

SYNOPSIS
    The basic usage of CBSSports::Getopt:

      #!/usr/bin/perl
      use strict;
      use warnings;
      use CBSSports::Getopt qw(GetOptions Usage);
  
      my $opts = GetOptions( 'l|league-name' );
      Usage() unless $opts->{league_name};
  
      __END__
  
      =head1 Name
  
      sample-script - A sample script using CBSSports::Getopt
  
      =head1 Usage
  
      sample-script [options]
  
      =head1 Options
  
        -h --help     Print this usage statement and exit.
        -H --man      Print the complete documentation and exit.
        -v --verbose  Turn on verbose output
           --version  Print script version information and quit

Examples
  Calling the Script's Usage
      sample-script -h

    You can also pass additonal options to Getopt::Long::Configure via
    Configure

      use CBSSports::Getopt qw(GetOptions Usage Configure);
  
      Configure( 'bundling' );
      my $opts = GetOptions( 'l|league-name' );
      Usage() unless $opts->{league_name};

DESCRIPTION
    The purpose of this module is to provide a simple way that script
    authors can easily define options and usage without have to duplicate
    code in each of their scripts.

    This module provides the following functionality:

  Getopt::Long for Option Parsing
    Simply pass an array of Getopt::Long options to GetOptions and receive a
    hash populated with the options you defined. See Getopt::Long for
    details on option syntax. (note that 'no_auto_abbr' and 'no_ignore_case'
    are enabled insead of Getopt::Long's defaults)

    *   The following options are automatically defined for you.

          -h --help     Show script usage and options
          -H --man      Show full manpage (all pod in script)
          -v --verbose  Incremental verbose ( -v -v -v, verbose = 3 );
             --version  Display version and exit.

        You can override these options if nessesary via Configure(
        'allow_preset_override' ), but are advised against. We'd like to
        keep a common interface to all our scripts.

    *   When specifying a short option name, you should define a long one as
        well.

          GetOptions( 'l' );  VS   GetOptions( 'l|league-name' );

        The long option name gets turned into the hash key. The more verbose
        you are in choosing an option names, the easier it is to tell what
        the option is. You don't get penalized for naming these options so
        other people can understand them. (other people also includes
        yourself a month from now) :)

    *   The longest option names get translated into the hash key ( with '_'
        subsituted for '-' )

        For example, if you pass in

          my $opts = GetOptions( 'league-id|league-name|l' );

        The result will be stored in

          $opts->{league_name}

        If two keys of the same length are passed in, the first one found
        will be used for the hash key.

    *   Getopt::Long auto abbreviate is turned off by default

        By default Getopt::Long auto abbreviates all long options. Although
        this functionality can be clever, it is not always clear. Let's err
        on the side of caution and avoid cleverness.

    *   Getopt::Long ignore case turned off by default.

        Similarly, ignoring case on options may result in confusion. In
        order to keep things clear, the script should always require the
        proper case on command line options.

    *   By using CBSSports::Getopt, you will automatically get the ability
        to use a .rc file.

        For example, say you have a script named 'doit'. By using
        CBSSports::Getopt, you will automatically be able to store commonly
        used options in a '.doitrc' file in your home directory. When the
        script runs, it will read in that optional file and will append any
        options to @ARGV before the command line arguments are run. Comments
        and leading/trailing whitespace are removed before processing. You
        can have multiples options per line.

          # contents of .doitrc
          -u web   # run as user web

  Pod::Usage for Displaying Script Usage
    *   Usage is just simply pod within your script

        At a minimum, you should write pod within your script that contains
        the USAGE and OPTIONS sections. However, you can write a whole man
        page if you like :)

INTERFACE
  GetOptions( $option1, $option2 );
    Pass in an array of options for Getopt::Long::GetOptions to parse. The
    function call will return a hash reference of the options you chose to
    capture. Only specifying single character options is not allowed. Each
    single character option must have a long couterpart. However, a long
    option can be specified without a single character counterpart.

      'h'       # incorrect - will fail
      'h|help'  # fine - will define -h and --help
      'help'    # fine - will define --help

    For example:

      use CBSSports::Getopt;
      my $opts = GetOptions(
          's|source-point=s', 'r|range-point=s', 'p|single-point=s', 'b|copy-to-begining',
          'e|copy-to-end',    'q|quiet',         'n|do-nothing',
      );

    If the script is executed without command line parameters, the hash
    reference returned from the GetOptions call (ex. $opts) will contain:

      {
        'verbose'          => undef,
        'quiet'            => undef,
        'copy_to_end'      => undef,
        'version'          => undef,
        'range_point'      => undef,
        'source_point'     => undef,
        'single_point'     => undef,
        'do_nothing'       => undef,
        'copy_to_begining' => undef
      }

    (Note: verbose and version are automatically defined for you)

  Usage( message => $error_message, verbose => $verbosity_level )
    Call usage with an error message string which will be displayed before
    the output and verbosity level. If no verbosity level is specified,
    Usage will only show USAGE and OPTIONS pod secitons.

  Configure( $config1, $config2 );
    Configure checks for 'allow_preset_override' before passing the rest of
    the arguments to Getopt::Long::Configure. See Getopt::Long for details.
    'allow_preset_override' allows you define '-h', '-H', and '-v' for
    another purpose other than their defaults.

CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT
    By default, every command line script that uses CBSSports::Getopt will
    be able to pull commonly used options from an .rc file of the same name.
    For example, 'auto-load-rosters' would use '.auto-load-rostersrc' from
    your home directory.

    Leading/trailing whitespace and comments in the '.rc' files are removed
    before processing.

DEPENDENCIES
    CBSSports::Getopt has the following dependancies:

    *   Getopt::Long

    *   Pod::Usage

    *   File::HomeDir

BUGS AND LIMITATIONS
    Some scripts may use '-h', '-H' or '-v' for something other than 'help',
    'verbose', 'man'. You can override these defaults via Configure(
    'allow_preset_override' );
