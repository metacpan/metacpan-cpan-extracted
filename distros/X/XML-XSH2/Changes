Release 2.1.2:
Bug fixes and minor enhancements.

Changes since 2.1.1:

 - expand parameters in a command shell pipe
 - fixed documentation URL in the docs (pointed out by Josef Kutej)

 - add a space to the default prompt

Release 2.1.1:
Bug fixes and minor enhancements.

Changes since 2.1.0:
The project repository was migrated from CVS to SVN.

Several important bug and compatibility fixes and a three new XPath
functions:

 - xsh:lineno()
   returns the line-number of the current node (the function was present
   before but was not documented)
 - xsh:span($start-node,$end-node)
   returns a node-set which forms a span of sibling nodes
   starting at $start-node and ending at $end-node
   (these two must be siblings).

 - xsh:context($node,$before,$after?)
   returns a node-set of sibling nodes surrounding $node. The span
   consists of (up to) $before-many nodes immediately preceding
   $node, the $node itself, and (up to) $after-many nodes
   immediately following $node. If the $after is not given, 
   the value of $before is assumed.

Release 2.1.0:
Feature enhancements.

Changes since 2.0.2:
--------------------
Incompatible Changes:
  - commands 'rename' and 'map' have new syntax and semantics:

     OLD (XSH 2.0.2)              | NEW (XSH 2.1.0)
     -----------------------------+-----------------------------------
     map { $_=uc } //text();      | map { uc } //text();
     map { s/foo/bar/ } //text(); | map :i { s/foo/bar/ } //text();
     map { $_='link' } //ref;     | rename link //ref;

New Features:
  - XSH scripts can be "compiled" (xsh -D) into Perl scripts
    which start faster (see xsh --help for details)
  - XML::XSH2::Compile module allows efficient embedding of
    XSH2 scripts into Perl modules (see the module's manpage)
  - new command 'set' simplifies creating and modifying nodes
  - new command 'hash' simplifies hashing/grouping nodes by arbitrary keys
  - new commands 'change-ns-prefix' and 'change-ns-uri' add full control
    over namespace declarations
  - XPath functions xsh:match() (regexp matching),
    xsh:filename() (introspection), and xsh:lookup() (hash retrieval),
    xsh:document() (get open document by filename), and xsh:documents()
    (get all open documents)
  - the interactive shell has a customizable prompt

Enhancements:
  - the mapping expression of 'rename' and 'map' can be XPath
  - added save --encoding flag
  - added echo --no-space (:n) flag
  - pwd and locate can return paths based on a nearest (ancestor-or-self) ID

--------------------
XSH2 language:

 - only one kind of variables
 - better integration with Perl: any argument can be specified either
   as an XPath or Perl expression

   positional arguments as in XSH1): --flag or :f and --param val or
   :p val
 - various commands provide better functionality based on new options
   and flags introduced in XSH2
 - true lexical variables (a.k.a. my)
 - several new commands introduced:
   edit, edit-string, canonical, index, my, set-dtd, expr, do
 - new 'eval' command evaluates given string as XSH2

New features:
   - new xsh option --format to start with indent 1 and keep_blanks 0
