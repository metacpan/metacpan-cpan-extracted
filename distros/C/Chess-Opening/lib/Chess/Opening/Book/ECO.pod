=head1 DESCRIPTION

The Encyclopedia of Chess Openings ECO is a classification of chess openings.
Openings are divided into five groups A, B, C, D, E and further classified
into subgroups numbered 00-99.

The popular chess database program Scid resp. its fork
L<Scid vs PC|http://scidvspc.sourceforge.net/> extended ECO codes with an
even finer granularity, see L<http://scidvspc.sourceforge.net/doc/ECO.htm>.

This module offers access to both the classical ECO information and the
Scid extensions.
