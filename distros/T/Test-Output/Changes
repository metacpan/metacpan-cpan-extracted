Revision history for Perl module Test::Output

1.033 2021-02-11T00:21:54Z
	* v1.032 had some regressions because I released 1.031 from an 
	unmerged branch. https://github.com/briandfoy/test-output/issues/8
	This was noticed by Tina MÃ¼ller in https://github.com/os-autoinst/os-autoinst/pull/1622
	* I didn't realize that I'd released an experiment in 2017, but
	no own complained until it was reverted (by releasing from master).
	The experiment worked I guess? Sub::Exporter is gone, so the 
	dependency tree for this is greatly reduced, and now it's gone
	again.

1.032 2021-01-28T22:15:07Z
	* Fix cut-n-paste error in docs (Github #6, hexcoder)

1.031 2017-03-29T21:30:57Z
	* Get rid of Sub::Exporter. That module has nice features that this
	module doesn't use and the prereq is causing problems with CPAN
	Testers. CPAN Grep didn't show anyone using advanced features for
	exports.

1.03 - 2014-01-03
	* Get rid of MYMETA

1.02 - 2013-07-08

	* Remove the ::Tie stuff. It should be fully Capture::Tiny
	now.

1.01_01 - 2012-05-14
	* David Golden re-did everything with Capture::Tiny
	to get around the odd output paths that we coudn't
	handle with a tie.

	* Bump to a full release. This fixes the tests that failed
	in the new 5.14 regex stringification

          the output that doesn't match.
	* replaced "comment" with "description"
