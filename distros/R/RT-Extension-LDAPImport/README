NAME
    RT::Extension::LDAPImport - Import Users from an LDAP store

SYNOPSIS
    In RT_SiteConfig.pm:

        Set($LDAPHost,'my.ldap.host')
        Set($LDAPUser,'me');
        Set($LDAPPassword,'mypass');
        Set($LDAPFilter, '(&(cn = users))');
        Set($LDAPMapping, {Name         => 'uid', # required
                           EmailAddress => 'mail',
                           RealName     => 'cn',
                           WorkPhone    => 'telephoneNumber',
                           Organization => 'departmentName'});
    
        # Add to any existing plugins
        Set(@Plugins, qw(RT::Extension::LDAPImport));
    
        # If you want to sync Groups from LDAP into RT
    
        Set($LDAPGroupBase, 'ou=Groups,o=Our Place');
        Set($LDAPGroupFilter, '(&(cn = Groups))');
        Set($LDAPGroupMapping, {Name               => 'cn',
                                Member_Attr        => 'member',
                                Member_Attr_Value  => 'dn' });

    Running the import:

        # Run a test import
        /opt/rt4/local/plugins/RT-Extension-LDAPImport/bin/rtldapimport \
        --debug > ldapimport.debug 2>&1
    
        # Run for real, possibly put in cron
        /opt/rt4/local/plugins/RT-Extension-LDAPImport/bin/rtldapimport \
        --import

INSTALLATION
    perl Makefile.PL
    make

    Restart your webserver

CONFIGURATION
    All of the configuration for the importer goes your RT_SiteConfig.pm
    file. Some of these values pass through to Net::LDAP so you can check
    there for valid values and more advanced options.

    Set($LDAPHost,'our.ldap.host');
        Hostname or ldap(s):// uri:

    Set($LDAPUser, 'uid=foo,ou=users,dc=example,dc=com');
        Your LDAP username or DN. If unset, we'll attempt an anonymous bind.

    Set($LDAPPassword, 'ldap pass');
        Your LDAP password.

    Set($LDAPBase, 'ou=People,o=Our Place');
        Base object to search from.

    Set($LDAPFilter, '(&(cn = users))');
        The LDAP search filter to apply (in this case, find all the users).

    Set($LDAPMapping...
            Set($LDAPMapping, {Name         => 'uid',
                               EmailAddress => 'mail',
                               RealName     => 'cn',
                               WorkPhone    => 'telephoneNumber',
                               Organization => 'departmentName'});

        This provides the mapping of attributes in RT to attribute(s) in
        LDAP. Only Name is required for RT.

        The values in the mapping (i.e. the LDAP fields, the right hand
        side) can be one of the following:

        an attribute
            LDAP attribute to use. Only first value is used if attribute is
            multivalue. For example:

                EmailAddress => 'mail',

        an array reference
            The LDAP attributes can also be an arrayref of LDAP fields, for
            example:

                WorkPhone => [qw/CompanyPhone Extension/]

            which will be concatenated together with a space. First values
            of each attribute are used in case they have multiple values.

        a subroutine reference
            The LDAP attribute can also be a subroutine reference that does
            mapping, for example:

                YYY => sub {
                    my %args = @_;
                    my @values = grep defined && length, $args{ldap_entry}->get_value('XXX');
                    return @values;
                },

            The subroutine should return value or list of values. The
            following arguments are passed into the function in a hash:

            self
                Instance of this class.

            ldap_entry
                Net::LDAP::Entry instance that is currently mapped.

            import
                Boolean value indicating whether it's import or a dry run.
                If it's dry run (import is false) then function shouldn't
                change anything.

            mapping
                Hash reference with the currently processed mapping, eg.
                $LDAPMapping.

            rt_field and ldap_field
                The currently processed key and value from the mapping.

            result
                Hash reference with results of completed mappings for this
                ldap entry. This should be used to inject that are not in
                the mapping, not to inspect. Mapping is processed in literal
                order of the keys.

        The keys in the mapping (i.e. the RT fields, the left hand side) may
        be a user custom field name prefixed with UserCF., for example
        'UserCF.Employee Number' => 'employeeId'. Note that this only adds
        values at the moment, which on single value CFs will remove any old
        value first. Multiple value CFs may behave not quite how you expect.
        If the attribute no longer exists on a user in LDAP, it will be
        cleared on the RT side as well.

        You may also prefix any RT custom field name with CF. inside your
        mapping to add available values to a Select custom field. This
        effectively takes user attributes in LDAP and adds the values as
        selectable options in a CF. It does not set a CF value on any RT
        object (User, Ticket, Queue, etc). You might use this to populate a
        ticket Location CF with all the locations of your users so that
        tickets can be associated with the locations in use.

    Set($LDAPCreatePrivileged, 1);
        By default users are created as Unprivileged, but you can change
        this by setting $LDAPCreatePrivileged to 1.

    Set($LDAPGroupName,'My Imported Users');
        The RT Group new and updated users belong to. By default, all users
        added or updated by the importer will belong to the 'Imported from
        LDAP' group.

    Set($LDAPSkipAutogeneratedGroup, 1);
        Set this to true to prevent users from being automatically added to
        the group configured by $LDAPGroupName.

    Set($LDAPUpdateUsers, 1);
        By default, existing users are skipped. If you turn on
        LDAPUpdateUsers, we will clobber existing data with data from LDAP.

    Set($LDAPUpdateOnly, 1);
        By default, we create users who don't exist in RT but do match your
        LDAP filter and obey $LDAPUpdateUsers for existing users. This
        setting updates existing users, overriding $LDAPUpdateUsers, but
        won't create new users who are found in LDAP but not in RT.

    Set($LDAPGroupBase, 'ou=Groups,o=Our Place');
        Where to search for groups to import.

    Set($LDAPGroupFilter, '(&(cn = Groups))');
        The search filter to apply.

    Set($LDAPGroupMapping...
            Set($LDAPGroupMapping, {Name               => 'cn',
                                    Member_Attr        => 'member',
                                    Member_Attr_Value  => 'dn' });

        A mapping of RT attributes to LDAP attributes to identify group
        members. Name will become the name of the group in RT, in this case
        pulling from the cn attribute on the LDAP group record returned.
        Everything besides Member_Attr_Value is processed according to rules
        described in documentation for $LDAPMapping option, so value can be
        array or code reference besides scalar.

        Member_Attr is the field in the LDAP group record the importer
        should look at for group members. These values (there may be
        multiple members) will then be compared to the RT user name, which
        came from the LDAP user record. See t/group-callbacks.t for a
        complex example of using a code reference as value of this option.

        Member_Attr_Value, which defaults to 'dn', specifies where on the
        LDAP user record the importer should look to compare the member
        value. A match between the member field on the group record and this
        identifier (dn or other LDAP field) on a user record means the user
        will be added to that group in RT.

        id is the field in LDAP group record that uniquely identifies the
        group. This is optional and shouldn't be equal to mapping for Name
        field. Group names in RT must be distinct and you don't need another
        unique identifier in common situation. However, when you rename a
        group in LDAP, without this option set properly you end up with two
        groups in RT.

        You can provide a Description key which will be added as the group
        description in RT. The default description is 'Imported from LDAP'.

    Set($LDAPImportGroupMembers, 1);
        When disabled, the default, LDAP group import expects that all LDAP
        members already exist as RT users. Often the user import stage,
        which happens before groups, is used to create and/or update group
        members by using an $LDAPFilter which includes a memberOf attribute.

        When enabled, by setting to 1, LDAP group members are explicitly
        imported before membership is synced with RT. This enables
        groups-only configurations to also import group members without
        specifying a potentially long and complex $LDAPFilter using
        memberOf. It's particularly handy when memberOf isn't available on
        user entries.

        Note that $LDAPFilter still applies when this option is enabled, so
        some group members may be filtered out from the import.

    Set($LDAPSizeLimit, 1000);
        You can set this value if your LDAP server has result size limits.

Mapping Groups Between RT and LDAP
    If you are using the importer, you likely want to manage access via LDAP
    by putting people in groups like 'DBAs' and 'IT Support', but also have
    groups for other non-RT related things. In this case, you won't want to
    create all of your LDAP groups in RT. To limit the groups that get
    mirrored, construct your $LDAPGroupFilter as an OR (|) with all of the
    RT groups you want to mirror from LDAP. For example:

        Set($LDAPGroupBase, 'OU=Groups,OU=Company,DC=COM');
        Set($LDAPGroupFilter, '(|(CN=DBAs)(CN=IT Support))');

    The importer will then import only the groups that match. In this case,
    import means:

    *   Verifying the group is in AD;

    *   Creating the group in RT if it doesn't exist;

    *   Populating the group with the members identified in AD;

    The import script will also issue a warning if a user isn't found in RT,
    but this should only happen when testing. When running with --import on,
    users are created before groups are processed, so all users (group
    members) should exist unless there are inconsistencies in your LDAP
    configuration.

Running the Import
    Executing rtldapimport will run a test that connects to your LDAP server
    and prints out a list of the users found. To see more about these users,
    and to see more general debug information, include the --debug flag.

    That debug information is also sent to the RT log with the debug level.
    Errors are logged to the screen and to the RT log.

    Executing rtldapimport with the --import flag will cause it to import
    users into your RT database. It is recommended that you make a database
    backup before doing this. If your filters aren't set properly this could
    create a lot of users or groups in your RT instance.

RT Versions
    The importer works with RT 4.0 and above.

LDAP Filters
    The ldapsearch
    <http://www.openldap.org/software/man.cgi?query=ldapsearch&manpath=OpenL
    DAP+2.0-Release> utility in openldap can be very helpful while refining
    your filters.

Developing
    If you want to run tests for this extension, you should create the
    inc/.author directory and will need to set RT_DBA_USER and
    RT_DBA_PASSWORD environment variables to a database user that can
    create/drop tests databases as needed.

    Do not run tests in a production environment.

METHODS
  connect_ldap
    Relies on the config variables $RT::LDAPHost, $RT::LDAPUser and
    $RT::LDAPPassword being set in your RT Config files.

     Set($LDAPHost,'my.ldap.host')
     Set($LDAPUSER,'me');
     Set($LDAPPassword,'mypass');

    LDAPUser and LDAPPassword can be blank, which will cause an anonymous
    bind.

    LDAPHost can be a hostname or an ldap:// ldaps:// uri.

  run_user_search
    Set up the appropriate arguments for a listing of users.

  _run_search
    Executes a search using the provided base and filter.

    Will connect to LDAP server using connect_ldap.

    Returns an array of Net::LDAP::Entry objects, possibly consolidated from
    multiple LDAP pages.

  import_users import => 1|0
    Takes the results of the search from run_search and maps attributes from
    LDAP into RT::User attributes using $RT::LDAPMapping. Creates RT users
    if they don't already exist.

    With no arguments, only prints debugging information. Pass --import to
    actually change data.

    $RT::LDAPMapping> should be set in your RT_SiteConfig.pm file and look
    like this.

     Set($LDAPMapping, { RTUserField => LDAPField, RTUserField => LDAPField });

    RTUserField is the name of a field on an RT::User object LDAPField can
    be a simple scalar and that attribute will be looked up in LDAP.

    It can also be an arrayref, in which case each of the elements will be
    evaluated in turn. Scalars will be looked up in LDAP and concatenated
    together with a single space.

    If the value is a sub reference, it will be executed. The sub should
    return a scalar, which will be examined. If it is a scalar, the value
    will be looked up in LDAP. If it is an arrayref, the values will be
    concatenated together with a single space.

    By default users are created as Unprivileged, but you can change this by
    setting $LDAPCreatePrivileged to 1.

  _import_user
    We have found a user to attempt to import; returns the RT::User object
    if it was found (or created), undef if not.

  _cache_user ldap_entry => Net::LDAP::Entry, [user => { ... }]
    Adds the user to a global cache which is used when importing groups
    later.

    Optionally takes a second argument which is a user data object returned
    by _build_user_object. If not given, _cache_user will call
    _build_user_object itself.

    Returns the user Name.

  _check_ldap_mapping
    Returns true is there is an LDAPMapping configured, returns false, logs
    an error and disconnects from ldap if there is no mapping.

  _build_user_object
    Utility method which wraps _build_object to provide sane defaults for
    building users. It also tries to ensure a Name exists in the returned
    object.

  _build_object
    Internal method - a wrapper around "_parse_ldap_mapping" that flattens
    results turning every value into a scalar.

    The following:

        [
            [$first_value1, ... ],
            [$first_value2],
            $scalar_value,
        ]

    Turns into:

        "$first_value1 $first_value2 $scalar_value"

    Arguments are just passed into "_parse_ldap_mapping".

   _parse_ldap_mapping
    Internal helper method that maps an LDAP entry to a hash according to
    passed arguments. Takes named arguments:

    ldap_entry
        Net::LDAP::Entry instance that should be mapped.

    only
        Optional regular expression. If passed then only matching entries in
        the mapping will be processed.

    only
        Optional regular expression. If passed then matching entries in the
        mapping will be skipped.

    mapping
        Hash that defines how to map. Key defines position in the result.
        Value can be one of the following:

        If we're passed a scalar or an array reference then value is:

            [
                [value1_of_attr1, value2_of_attr1],
                [value1_of_attr2, value2_of_attr2],
            ]

        If we're passed a subroutine reference as value or as an element of
        array, it executes the code and returned list is pushed into results
        array:

            [
                @result_of_function,
            ]

        All arguments are passed into the subroutine as well as a few more.
        See more in description of $LDAPMapping option.

    Returns hash reference with results, each value is an array with
    elements either scalars or arrays as described above.

  create_rt_user
    Takes a hashref of args to pass to RT::User::Create Will try loading the
    user and will only create a new user if it can't find an existing user
    with the Name or EmailAddress arg passed in.

    If the $LDAPUpdateUsers variable is true, data in RT will be clobbered
    with data in LDAP. Otherwise we will skip to the next user.

    If $LDAPUpdateOnly is true, we will not create new users but we will
    update existing ones.

  add_user_to_group
    Adds new users to the group specified in the $LDAPGroupName variable
    (defaults to 'Imported from LDAP'). You can avoid this if you set
    $LDAPSkipAutogeneratedGroup.

  setup_group
    Pulls the $LDAPGroupName object out of the DB or creates it if we need
    to do so.

   add_custom_field_value
    Adds values to a Select (one|many) Custom Field. The Custom Field should
    already exist, otherwise this will throw an error and not import any
    data.

    This could probably use some caching.

   update_object_custom_field_values
    Adds CF values to an object (currently only users). The Custom Field
    should already exist, otherwise this will throw an error and not import
    any data.

    Note that this code only adds values at the moment, which on single
    value CFs will remove any old value first. Multiple value CFs may behave
    not quite how you expect.

  import_groups import => 1|0
    Takes the results of the search from run_group_search and maps
    attributes from LDAP into RT::Group attributes using
    $RT::LDAPGroupMapping.

    Creates groups if they don't exist.

    Removes users from groups if they have been removed from the group on
    LDAP.

    With no arguments, only prints debugging information. Pass --import to
    actually change data.

   run_group_search
    Set up the appropriate arguments for a listing of users.

  _import_group
    The user has run us with --import, so bring data in.

  create_rt_group
    Takes a hashref of args to pass to RT::Group::Create Will try loading
    the group and will only create a new group if it can't find an existing
    group with the Name or EmailAddress arg passed in.

    If $LDAPUpdateOnly is true, we will not create new groups but we will
    update existing ones.

    There is currently no way to prevent Group data from being clobbered
    from LDAP.

   find_rt_group
    Loads groups by Name and by the specified LDAP id. Attempts to resolve
    renames and other out-of-sync failures between RT and LDAP.

   find_rt_group_by_ldap_id
    Loads an RT::Group by the ldap provided id (different from RT's internal
    group id)

   add_group_members
    Iterate over the list of values in the Member_Attr LDAP entry. Look up
    the appropriate username from LDAP. Add those users to the group. Remove
    members of the RT Group who are no longer members of the LDAP group.

  _show_group
    Show debugging information about the group record we're going to import
    when the groups reruns us with --import.

   disconnect_ldap
    Disconnects from the LDAP server.

    Takes no arguments, returns nothing.

Utility Functions
   screendebug
    We always log to the RT log file with level 'debug'. This duplicates the
    messages to the screen.
