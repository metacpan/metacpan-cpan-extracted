p5-Palm version 1.400, released March 14, 2015

This is p5-Palm, a set of Perl 5 modules for reading,
manipulating, and writing the .pdb and .prc database files used by
Palm OS devices such as the PalmPilot and its successors.

You'll also need the Palm::PDB and Palm::Raw modules.  They used to be
distributed as part of p5-Palm, but were split out into their own
distribution because they are also useful for manipulating the
Mobipocket e-book format, which is also used for Amazon Kindle books.
The modules remaining in p5-Palm are generally useful only if you're
dealing with files from actual Palm OS devices.



INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

	perl Makefile.PL
