      Reorder this file so that the most recent changes go at the top
      Mmm. So nobody told me that it didn't build under threads
      (and it seems that I never tested that)
      Fixed the perl context bugs. My own fault for PERL_NO_IMPLICIT_CONTEXT

      Oops. Short delay. I've been a fool. Why use PerlIO_apply_layera when
      all I need to do is push 1 layer PerlIO_push

      So PerlIO_apply_layera() changed in 5.7.2 to use PerlIO_list_t *
      rather than AV *, and everything was broken.  zip.xs now fixed.
      (but I'm not sure if this is supposed to be a public API. It's not in
       the perliol.h, hence warnings from gcc about integer to pointer
       conversions)
      Moved all the test modules into t, so that the CPAN scripts don't think
      I'm providing all the dummy modules in there (Thanks to Andreas König for
      explaining this one)

      Was leaking a scalar for each zip stored file encountered, as the
      result of newSVpvf never had its refcount decreased.
      Now re-written this section at the end of findfile() to build an AV
      and call the new PerlIO_apply_layera() function. The argument to the
      PerlIO::subfile layer is now a UV, which saves converting a number to and
      from a string.
      Added make-zips.pl to the MANIFEST, which had been forgotten.
      Tweak the Makefile.PL so that make-zips.pl and pushme.pl don't get
      spotted and hence installed. (They aren't meant to be installed)
