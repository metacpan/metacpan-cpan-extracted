What is it ?
------------
Catalog is a perl program that allows to create, maintain and display
Yahoo! like directories. The user interface is 100% HTML. It requires a
MySQL database to run.

The general idea behind the design of Catalog is that creating a catalog
is mainly a matter of organizing objects in a structured tree. For
Catalog the objects are records in a table of the SQL database. 
The structured tree is a set of tree nodes and relations between these
nodes. The maintainer of the catalog is in charge of building the tree
and placing objects in this tree.

Here is a short list of the functions provided by Catalog:

* Display structured trees of resources.
* Display chronologically ordered resources and associated calendar.
* Display alphabetical indexes of resources.
* Allow full text search in the resources and the category names.
* Powerful HTML based administration of catalogs.
* On-Line editing of resource records.
* Handle an arbitrary number of catalogs.
* High performances using mod_perl and Apache.
* Easy customization of the user view using HTML template files.
* It is possible to define more than one view of the same catalog.
* Load and unload a thematic catalog in XML.
* Create an HTML dump of a structured tree to publish a static 
  version.
* Complete documentation including a guide and a reference manual.
* Ready to use example.
