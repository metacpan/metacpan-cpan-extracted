1.01  Thu Dec 11 19:17:01 1997

	Suggested by Michael Pepper <pepper@w3pg.com>:

1.03  Tue Feb 17 09:58:05 1998
	- Fixed bug, sometimes deleted records weren't removed from the
		file system
	- Added a feature to limit the number of records in memory (cache size)

1.04  Sat Feb 27 13:05:27 1999
	Repported by Carsten Heyl <heyl@kirk.nads.de> and
		"Garnet R. Chaney" <gchaney@webmill.com>:

	- Fixed bug that prevented the value "0" from being written

	Suggested by Carsten Heyl <heyl@kirk.nads.de>:

	- Added a feature to encode/decode keys when saved to the filesystem

1.05  Mon Mar  1 17:05:15 1999
	Repported by Chris Nandor <pudge@pobox.com>

	- Module was Unix dependent (used '/' as path component separator,
		'.' as current directory, etc.)
	  	Now the module uses File::Spec (if available) and Cwd, so
		it should be truly portable.
	
	Thanks to Chris Nandor for his help (debugging).

	- Fixes to work with perl 5.6.0; by Jose A. Rodriguez <josear@ac.upc.es>
