	* Bump the version to reindex (See https://github.com/andk/pause/issues/248 )

1.224 2017-04-18T11:41:22Z
	* Fix up various dist things and clarify that this is under
	the Artistic License 2.0.

1.20 - 2014-08-16
	* Bump to user version

1.19_01 - 2013-09-02
	* Take out // (5.10 feature I used without thought) to restore
	5.8 compatibility.

1.19 - 2013-08-27
	* Update for modern usage, better code
	* I use this as an example in Mastering Perl, so I shouldn't
	leave embarrassing practices in the code. :)

1.17 - 2009-01-30
	* Updated the docs for the move to Github
	* There aren't any code changes

1.16 - 2007-10-27
	* distro cleanups after moving from CVS to SVN

1.15 - 2007-03-18
	* Cleaning dist for new SVN repository
	* No need to upgrade

1.14 - 2007-01-09
	* updated copyright and license info
	* no code changes, so no need to upgrade

1.13 - 2006-05-17
	* Minor cleanups in docs, copyright, and pod testing. No need to
	upgrade.

1.12 - 2005-03-08
	* Added POD coverage tests.  No need to upgrade

1.11 - 2005-01-03
	* Previously, this module refused to work unless the input array had
	more than one element.  What's the point of cycling otherwise?  I've
	removed that restriction, though, because I shouldn't be the one who
	gets to decide that.  A one element array should get a chance to act
	like any other array.  It just happens to have one element.

1.09 - 2004-09-02
	* Just some distribution fixes.  No need to upgrade.

1.07 - 2004-01-31

	* Removed dependencies on Test::Manifest, Test::Pod and
	  File::Find::Rule.
	* Fixed some warnings in tests.

1.06 - 2002-12-17
	* cycle.t test was actually one from Tie::Toggle.  it is not
	the right test.

1.05 - 2002-12-17
	* removed 'require 5.6.0' (perl5.8 complains about v-strings)
	* beefed up distribution files
	* no code changes --- no need to install if you already have this

0.05 - 2002-08-14
	* added reset() method for underlying object so Andy
	Lester can do HTML table tricks
	* since I was there, I added previous() and next()
	methods so you can peek at values without affecting
	the position.

	* minor doc fixes

0.01 - 2000-08-12
