Win32::GUI::UserGuide::FAQ - Frequently asked questions about Win32::GUI

=head1 The Win32::GUI F.A.Q.

These are the "Frequently Asked Questions" for the Perl Win32::GUI
module. These questions and answers have been collected from the
Win32::GUI-Users mailing list.

You can subscribe to the mailing list at L<http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/perl-win32-gui-users>

This FAQ is currently significantly out of date - hopefully it will
be reviewed and updated for the next Win32::GUI release.

=head2 Can I use a window handle in more than one process?

If you run some lengthy processing like web page retrieval with LWP,
database search, file processing etc., and you cannot call
$Window->DoEvents() within that processing, your window will seem to
freeze during your processing. The solution to that is, to do the
processing in a separate Windows thread or process. ActivePerl 5.6
simulates the "fork" command using Windows threads.

"Well, from Windows point of view, it is a thread. From Perl's point of
view, it is a process. The Perl interpreter is busily keeping the data
separate between the two threads (I'm not sure I understand the complete
technique of the magic that does that, but I'm sure it can be made to
work because the Perl language doesn't expose "real" addresses (much))."

"On the other hand, the (UNIX) model for "fork" is that the multiple
processes (threads on Perl for Windows) start off with identical
data/variables/file handles. And the Windows model for "windows" is that
the windows are owned by a process (not a thread), and can be accessed
by any thread that has the window handle. (And in fact, because Windows
was developed on DOS, the windows are even a bit visible to other
processes, but that doesn't concern us here.)"

"By creating the Win32::GUI objects before forking, both the parent and
child threads get copies (?) of the object variables. Because of the
nature of Windows, the embedded Window handles inside both copies of the
object variables are equally usable. Because of the (present) nature of
Win32::GUI, whereby most of the parameter data is pumped into Win32 API
parameters, and most of the return values are obtained by calling Win32
APIs to obtain it, I have shown experimentally that it is possible to
use the Win32::GUI object references from both a parent and a child
thread. Now it is important to remember that Windows only delivers
window messages to the first thread of a program, so in the Perl "fork"
environment, this gets translated to *only the parent process of a group
of Perl-forked processes can successfully run Win32::GUI::Dialog* (Yep,
I tried it the other way first, figuring that the parent could more
easily monitor the child process for death, since fork returns the child
pid, and waitpid works that way--but it just hung, and the windows never
appeared). However, *the child can use the object references created by
Win32::GUI* [before the fork] to access the "IsEnabled", "IsVisible"
attributes of the window widgets, and they are dynamically updated (not
cached in the object). The child can access the current selection from
combo boxes. The child can enable and disable widgets, and the display
gets updated appropriately. This is quite adequate for my application,
which now can do its "long" operations in the child "process", and keep
the GUI window "active" (except that certain parts get disabled during
"long" operations)."

=head2 Why does my window seem to freeze when my program is in a loop?

Put a call to DoEvents() inside the loop. This will ensure that all
queued messages are processed before going on with the loop:

  use strict;
  use Win32::GUI;

  my $main = Win32::GUI::Window->new(
    -name    => "Main",
    -title   => "Win32-GUI: Doevents-Demo",
    -left    => 100,
    -top     => 100,
    -width   => 600,
    -height  => 400,
  );

  sub Main_Terminate() {
    print "Main window terminated\n";
    return -1;
  }

  my $textfield = $main->AddTextfield(
    -name   => "Textfield",
    -text   => "have fun and more",
    -left   => 75,
    -top    => 150,
    -width  => 200,
    -height => 40,
    -readonly => 1,
  );

  $main->Show();

  $textfield->Text("Processing infile...");
  open INFILE, "<infile.txt" or die "open infile error: $!";
  my $linenr = 0;
  foreach my $line (<INFILE>) {
    $linenr++;
    $textfield->Text("Processing line $linenr");
    Win32::GUI::DoEvents() >= 0 or die "Window was closed during processing";*

    sleep 1; #body of the loop...
  }

  $textfield->Text("completed");
  Win32::GUI::DoEvents();
  sleep 1; #program continues...

This will, of course, make your loop run slightly slower (almost
irrelevant if there is no activity on the window). But there is the
advantage (other than having the Textfield saying "Processing...") of
being able to stop the loop in the middle by killing the window, or with
a 'dedicated' stopbutton, for example.

=head2 What about licensing?

If I develop a product in Perl with usage of the Win32::GUI module, and
I spread (well lets assume for FREE) to the public.. Is it still under
GNU license or do we have to pay the Win32::GUI team something?

"No, you don't have to pay anything. I'm not a lawyer and I don't want
to pay a lawyer :-) Win32::GUI is released under the Artistic License,
e.g. you can redistribute it under the same terms of Perl itself."

Note that some of the extensions may be released under different terms.
Please ensure that you check the documentation of such extensions
for individual licencing terms.

=head2 What is Win32::GUI?

"Win32::GUI is a Win32-platform native graphical user interface toolkit
for Perl. Basically, it's an XS implementation of most of the functions
found in user32.dll and gdi32.dll, with an object oriented Perl
interface and an event-based dialog model that mimic the functionality
of visual basic. It was a big fun for me to put it up, hope it will be a
fun for you too :-)"

=head2 Where can I get Win32::GUI?

The creator and guru of the Win32::GUI project is Aldo
Calpini. Some (old) information can be found on his website at
L<http://dada.perl.it/>.

The project is under active development, and the latest information
and releases can be found at the Win32::GUI homepage on SourceForge.

=over

=item L<http://perl-win32-gui.sourceforge.net/>

=item L<http://sourceforge.net/projects/perl-win32-gui/>

=back

Both source distributions and PPM distributions (for ActiveState
Perl 5.6 an 5.8) can be found here.  It should be noted that
the PPMs currently available directly from the ActiveState
repositories and now very old, and should not be preferred for
installations.

There are some other binary distributions around (some linked from
CPAN, for example), but due to complexities in the project's build
process these may well be missing the documentation.  SourceForge is
your best download location at the time of writing.

Full documentation is installed with the PPM installation, and
can be found online at:

=head2 How can I use Win32::GUI functions in EVAL?

Yes, Win32::GUI supports things like these (it's really Perl that
supports it :-), but you need to escape your window-handler variable $W:

    eval qq (
        sub main::$subtxt {
            print "button clicked\n";
            *\$W*->SimpleLabel->Text("Got a click");
        }
    );
    $@ or die "Error in eval: $@";   $$$verify

...and always check for $@ after an eval!

=head2 How can I get a vertical scrollbar in a textfield?

Add these options when you create the textfield:
  
  -multiline   => 1
  -autovscroll => 1

This should do the trick.

=head2 How can I get the selected portion of a textfield?

There is a Selection method that returns the start and end of the
selection. Then you just make a substr on the Textfield content:

  ($from, $to) = $Textfield->Selection();
  $var = substr($Textfield->Text, $from, $to-$from);

=head2 How can I get the _Change event from a RichEdit control?

"I'd like to share a solution to a problem that has been driving me
nuts for a while. I changed a Textfield control to a RichEdit and it
would not give me the _Change event. I dug in the GUI.xs and could find
nothing wrong. I finally tracked it down to the eventmask being zero,
which means that the notification messages don't come to the GUI message
loop in the first place. The workaround is to do

  $MainWindow->myRichEditField->SendMessage (0x445, 0, 1);

That sends EM_SETEVENTMASK (0x445) to the control with the ENM_CHANGE
bit set. Hope that spares somebody else a headache."

=head2 How can I format text in a RichEdit control?

There is a SetCharFormat method to the RichEdit control.

  $Rich->Select ($from_here, $to_there);
  $Rich->SetCharFormat (-color => $flashy_pink)

To set the font at the beginning you can use:

  my $Font = new Win32::GUI::Font(
   -name => "Courier New", 
   -height => 16,
   -bold => 0,
  );

  ### or the font/style of your choice...
  ### and then in your AddRichEdit use

  -font => $Font

=head2 How can I prevent the user from choosing more than one item in a Listview?

You can use the

  -singlesel

option on the ListView to achieve what you want.

=head2 How do I disable the standard window controls in the upper right corner

(that is, the Minimize, Maximize, and (sometimes) Help buttons)

Create a DialogBox and set the "-minimizebox", "-maximizebox",
"-helpbutton" options approprietly. For example,

  $db = new Win32::GUI::DialogBox(
    -name        => "dialog_box",
    -text        => "DialogBox Test",
    -size        => [800,550],
    -helpbutton  => 1,
    -menu        => 0,
    -maximizebox => 0,
    -minimizebox => 0,
    -resizable   => 0,
  );

=head2 What are the icon, button and modality values for MessageBox?

I think these will work, I haven't tried them all.

  Settings
  =================================
  0 - display only the OK button
  1 - display OK and Cancel buttons
  2 - display Abort, Retry, and Ignore buttons
  3 - display Yes, No, and Cancel buttons
  4 - display Yes and No buttons
  5 - display Retry and Cancel buttons

  16 - display Critical Message icon
  32 - display Warning Query icon
  48 - display Warning Message icon
  64 - display Information Message icon

  0 - set first button as default
  256 - set second button as default
  512 - set third button as default
  768 - set fourth button as default

 
  Return Values
  =============
  1 - OK
  2 - Cancel
  3 - Abort
  4 - Retry
  5 - Ignore
  6 - Yes
  7 - No

=head2 How can I change the cursor to an hourglass and back?

Basically, what you want is

  Win32::GUI::SetCursor ()

the tricky thing is to get the standard resource of the hourglass. Feel
free to use my perl module http://www.fairymails.com/perl/WinStRes.pm
for exactly this: (Notice: Win32::API must be installed)

  Win32::GUI::SetCursor (WinCursor (WAIT)); # hourglass ...
  Win32::GUI::SetCursor (WinCursor ()); # ... and back

What this module does is

  $LoadImage = new Win32::API ('user32', 'LoadImage', [N,N,I,I,I,I],N)
  or die 'can\'t find LoadImage function';
  ....
  %cursors =
  (
    'NORMAL'      => 32512,
    'IBEAM'       => 32513,
    'WAIT'        => 32514,
  ....
  sub WinCursor
  {
    local $_ = $cursors{$_[0]} or $cursors{'NORMAL'};
    return $LoadImage->Call (0, $_, 2, 0, 0, 0x8040);
  }

Example:

First download the module http://www.fairymails.com/perl/WinStRes.pm and
store it under the name 'WinStRes.pm' in the directory where you have
your perl program, or in the perl modules directory. Second, make sure
Win32::API is installed, or install it using ppm. The perl program below
now shows the hourglass cursor for two seconds each time the button
"search now" is clicked.

  use strict;
  use Win32::GUI;

  #How to get the "wait cursor" resource.
  #Alternative 1, using the Win32::API module:
  use Win32::API;
  my $loadImage = new Win32::API ('user32', 'LoadImage', ['N','N','I','I','I','I'],'N')
     or die 'cannot find LoadImage function';
  my $waitCursor = $loadImage->Call(0, 32514, 2, 0, 0, 0x8040);

  #Alternative 2, using the WinStRes module (uses Win32::API)
  #use WinStRes;  #download from http://www.fairymails.com/perl/WinStRes.pm
  #my $waitCursor = WinCursor("WAIT");

  my $main = Win32::GUI::Window->new(
    -name    => "Main",
    -title   => "Win32-GUI: Hourglass Cursor Demo",
    -left    => 100,
    -top     => 100,
    -width   => 600,
    -height  => 400,
  );

  my $search = $main->AddButton(
    -name    => 'Search',
    -text    => 'search now', 
    -left    => 25,
    -top     => 25,
  );

  sub Search_Click {
    print "Searching..."; 
    my $oldCursor = Win32::GUI::SetCursor($waitCursor);  #show hourglass ...

    sleep 2;  #do your search here
    print "done\n";
    Win32::GUI::SetCursor($oldCursor);  #show previous arrow cursor again
    return 1;
  }

  sub Main_Terminate {
    print "Main Window terminated\n";
    return -1;
  }

  $main->Show();
  Win32::GUI::Dialog();

=head2 Is there a spreadsheet (grid) look-a-like solution or component?

Have a look at Win32::GUI::Grid.

The original author was Laurent Rocher, but the module is included
with Win32::GUI from V1.04 onwards

=head2 Is there a inline web browser somewhere or an HTML or XML parser?

"No, and I don't think I will try to implement one :-) You should
instead look at Win32::OLE, to see if you can embed an InternetExplorer
instance in a window. That said, it seems that RichEdit 3.0 (available
in Windows 2000) has a lot of nice features, that I'll try to implement
if time permits."

So, I used the Win32:OLE example from Learning Perl on Win32:

  use Win32::OLE;
  my $browser = CreateObject OLE "InternetExplorer.Application.1" || return 0;
  $browser->{'Visible'} = 1;
  $browser->Navigate("http://www.perlmonks.org/");

This works fine, except I'm now forcing the user to use IE instead of
Netscape. And it's possible (not likely I realize) that they don't even
have IE. So what happens then?

To show an URL in the default browser of your PC, the Win32::Shell
helps. Win32::Shell can be downloaded from the Activestate archive using
ppm. It is not in CPAN at present (June 2001).

  use Win32::Shell;
  $url = "http://www.perlmonks.org";
  Win32::Shell::Execute("open", $url, undef, undef, "SW_SHOWNORMAL");

This starts the default browser opened to the correct URL, with no
delay, and no console window.

An alternative is to use Win32::GUI::AxWindow by Laurent Rocher. This
control adds ActiveX control hosting to Win32::GUI. This will allow you
to "add" a web browser to a Win32::GUI window.

Win32::GUI::AxWindow is included in the Win32::GUI distribution with
V1.04 and later.

=head2 Is there support for JPG or common image formats like PNG or GIF?

Win32::GUI::DIBitmap add new reading/writing bitmap formats to
Win32::GUI and some images manipulations (Conversion, Screen capture, ...).
This package uses FreeImage 3.5.1, an open source image library
supporting all common bitmap formats (visit:
L<http://freeimage.sourceforge.net/>).

Supports many formats, such as:

  Format  Reading Writing Description.
  BMP     Y       Y       Windows or OS/2 Bitmap
  ICO     Y       N       Windows Icon
  JPEG    Y       Y       JPEG - JFIF Compliant
  JNG     Y       N       JPEG Network Graphics
  KOALA   Y       N       C64 Koala Graphics
  IFF     Y       N       IFF Interleaved Bitmap
  MNG     Y       N       Multiple Network Graphics
  PBM     Y       Y       Portable Bitmap (ASCII)
  PBMRAW  Y       Y       Portable Bitmap (RAW)
  PCD     Y       N       Kodak PhotoCD
  PCX     Y       N       Zsoft Paintbrush
  PGM     Y       Y       Portable Greymap (ASCII)
  PGMRAW  Y       Y       Portable Greymap (RAW)
  PNG     Y       Y       Portable Network Graphics
  PPM     Y       Y       Portable Pixelmap (ASCII)
  PPMRAW  Y       Y       Portable Pixelmap (RAW)
  RAS     Y       N       Sun Raster Image
  TARGA   Y       N       Truevision Targa
  TIFF    Y       Y       Tagged Image File Format
  WBMP    Y       Y       Wireless Bitmap

=head2 How can I deal with moving and resizing stuff when a window is resized?

"Dealing with moving and resizing stuff when a window is resized is
really annoying, not to mention boring. So I created a class to make

=head2 How can I display a popup menu within a ListView?

Here is an example how it can be done:

  # define popup menu for listview
  my $PopupMenu = new Win32::GUI::Menu(
    "Item Properties" => "ItemProp",
    ">&Properties" => "ItemProperties",
  );
 
  # get right-click in listview
  sub DataView_RightClick {
     my($X, $Y) = Win32::GUI::GetCursorPos();
 
     $MainWindow->TrackPopupMenu($PopupMenu->{ItemProp},$X, $Y);
  }
 
  # clicked on particular menu item in popup menu
  sub ItemProperties_Click {
     ## code you want to process;
  }

=head2 I'm using the Win32::GUI::AxWindow module, but I can't navigate within the same browser I lauched from, how can I fix that?  

You need to use a WebBrowser control for that (not a MSHTML). MSHTML
display html but can not navigate in same window (lauch defaut
navigator). You can directly write HTML in a webbrowser with GetOLE and
Win32::OLE.

  $OLEControl = $Control->GetOLE(); # Get Win32::Ole object
  $OLEControl->Navigate("about:blank"); # Clear control and load a blank document
  $OLEControl->{Document}->write('perl.com <http://www.perl.com>'); # Write Html Now, when you click on link,
                                                                    # it navigate in same window.
