NAME

    RosettaCode - A tool to extract RosettaCode's code samples

SYNOPSIS

    From the command line:

        $ git clone https://github.com/acmeism/RosettaCodeData
        $ cd RosettaCodeData
        $ rosettacode           # or `make build`

DESCRIPTION

    RosettaCode.org is a fantastic wiki that contains ~1200 programming
    tasks, each implemented in up to ~900 programming languages. There are
    over 100,000 code samples!

    This tool aims to make it easier for programmers to obtain and try the
    various code samples.

    At this point, the main function is to extract the code examples and
    organize them into this git repository on GitHub:

      * https://github.com/acmeism/RosettaCodeData

    The make build command in that repository requires this CPAN module,
    which does all the work.
