NAME
    Tie::FileHandle::Split - Filehandle tie that captures, splits and stores
    output into files in a given path.

VERSION
    Version 0.95

DESCRIPTION
    This module, when tied to a filehandle, will capture and store all that
    is output to that handle. You should then select a path to store files
    and a size to split files.

SYNOPSIS
     # $path should exist or the current process have enough priv. for creation.
     # $size should be > 0.
     tie *HANDLE, 'Tie::FileHandle::Split', $path, $size;

     # Register code to listen to file creation
     (tied *HANDLE)->add_file_creation_listeners( sub {
            my ( $tied_object, $filename) = @_;
            print "Created $filename with size: " . -s $filename . "\n";
     } );

     # Will create int( $many_times_size / $split_size) files of size $split_size.
     # Will call each listener int( $many_times_size / $split_size) times.
     # Buffers will hold $many_times_size % $split_size outstanding bytes.
     (tied *HANDLE)->print( ' ' x $many_times_size );

     # Write all outstanding output from buffers to files.
     # The last file created can be smaller than split_size
     (tied *HANDLE)->write_buffers;

     # Get generated filenames to the moment
     (tied *HANDLE)->get_filenames();

METHODS
   "write_buffers"
    "write_buffers" writes all outstanding buffers to files. It is
    automatically called before destroying the object to ensure all data
    written to the tied filehandle is written to files. If additional data
    is written to the filehandle after a call to "write_buffers" a new file
    will be created. On a standard file split operation it is called after
    writting all data to the tied file handle ensure the last bit of data is
    written (in the most common case where data size is not exactly
    divisible by the split size).

   "get_filenames"
    "get_filenames" returns a list of the files generates until the moment
    of the call. It should be used to get the names of files and rename them
    to the desired filenames. In a standard splitting operation
    "get_filenames" is called after outputting all data to the filehandle
    and calling "write_buffers".

   "add_file_creation_listeners"
    "add_file_creation_listeners" adds methods to the list of listeners of
    the file creation event. Methods should be code, array, arrayref or any
    non-recursive structure resulting from them. Since methods are added to
    a HASH, several elements pointing to the same piece of code will be
    added only once. Code observing this event is called once per file
    created of the $split_size size defined in the tie clause. When called
    the Tie::FileHandle::Split object and the complete path to the newly
    created file is passed as parameter. The file is of the specified
    $split_size defined in the tie clause unless generated from a
    "write_buffers" call, has been closed and an effort has been made for it
    to sync (untested).

   "remove_file_creation_listeners"
    "remove_file_creation_listeners" removes a list of methods from the list
    of listeners of the file creation event. Methods should be code, array,
    arrayref or any non-recursive structure resulting from them.

   "clear_file_creation_listeners"
    "clear_file_creation_listeners" removes all methods from the list of
    listeners of the file creation event.

TODO
    *   Very untested for anything other than writing to the filehandle.

    *   write_buffers should sync to disk, untested and seeking advice.
