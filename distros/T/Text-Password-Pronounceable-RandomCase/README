NAME
    Text::Password::Pronounceable::RandomCase - Generate pronounceable
    passwords with random case

SYNOPSIS
      ## defaults to upper case in a quarter of all cases
      Text::Password::Pronounceable::RandomCase->generate(6, 10);

      ## Explicit
      Text::Password::Pronounceable::RandomCase->generate(6, 10, 4);

      ## Ditto
      my $pp = Text::Password::Pronounceable::RandomCase->new(6, 10, 4);
      $pp->generate;

DESCRIPTION
    Text::Password::Pronounceable produces pronouncable passwords. But it
    has the one disadvantage that it only uses lower case characters. This
    module tries to solve this shortcoming. The two methods *new()* and
    *generate()* take a third parameter, which determines the frequency of
    upper case characters. Any 1/N'th character will be uppercased on
    average.

    If you do not pass any arguments, *generate()* will produce passwords
    with a length of eight characters and a 1/4 probability for any
    character to be uppercased.
