    CPAN::Mini::Live - Keep CPAN Mini up to date

SYNOPSIS
      # have a ~/.minicpanrc:
      # (change local to where you want the mirror)
      remote: http://cpan.cpantesters.org/
      exact_mirror: 1
      force: 0
      trace: 0
      class: CPAN::Mini::Live

      # then run the minicpan command:
      % minicpan
      updating mirror...
      and live...

DESCRIPTION
    CPAN::Mini creates a minimal mirror of CPAN and is very useful indeed.
    However, to keep the mirror up to date, you must continually run
    minicpan. This module makes minicpan block and listen for live updates,
    thus keeping your minicpan live.

    This is an experimental module. Let's see how it works out.

    It works by having a backend running CPAN::Mini::Live::Publish which
    publishes file updates and deletions to FriendFeed.

    CPAN::Mini::Live first make sures it is up to date and then listens to
    these updates using the FriendFeed real-time API so your minicpan will
    be kept up to date in real time.

    You have to use the same mirror as the backend code,
    <http://cpan.cpantesters.org/>.
