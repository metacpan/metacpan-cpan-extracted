0.08  Tue Feb 10 2004

      old code should still work, though

    - still attempting to make t/30-as_string.t pass
    - added tinfo data
    - added tinfo1-4 subs and docs
    - pretty_print now uses tinfo1-4 subs

0.04  Sun Nov 30 2003
    - the module now "eats its own dog food" (get/set)
    - fixed pack/unpack template
    - reverted clear() back to settings SAUCE record defaults
    - from the above change, has_sauce() MUST be used to check if a file
      has sauce
    - added has_sauce() to docs
    - added get/set sauce_comments (number of comments)
    - get/set flags now returns/takes a number as output/input
    - spoon compatibility for SAUCE removal added and documented
    - suppressed "ambiguous read" warnings by qualifying them with CORE::
    - comments are actually truncated now, oops.
    - misc doc fixes
    - misc code clean-ups
    - Re-organized the directory structure
    - using Test::More to test
    - added several test

0.03  Sun Aug 10 2003
    - comment lines are auto-trucated when comments are set
    - comment data is now an array ref even when no comments are available.
    - as_string method created (used by all _write* subs)
    - internal sub _write_raw_data() now explicitly returns the data
    - _write_raw_data() also auto-fixes file size
    - SAUCE_ID and COMNT_ID are now exported.
    - has_sauce() sub added. You can now check SAUCE existance by
      doing: if ( $ansi->has_sauce  ) { ... }
    - auto_date() sub added. It will auto-set the date in the sauce record
      (unless it already exists). Calling it with no args uses the current
      date. Note: this is auto-called before a write()
    - convert_localtime() sub added. it takes a localtime-able value and
      turns it into a suitable SAUCE record date (uses time() if arg is
      omitted)

0.02  Sun Apr 06 2003
    Interface overhaul:
    - Removed the need to specify a filename on new()
    - You can specify nothing, a filename, a ref to a filehandle or raw data
      for new()
    - read(), write(), and remove() now require either a filename, a ref
      to a filehandle, or raw data to work
    - when using raw data, you must set the $is_raw_data flag to true
      ex: $ansi->read($data, 1);
    - get_id(), still gets the SAUCE ID, but you can now use get_sauce_id()
      and get_comnt_id() to get either ID.
    - clear() now sets all elements to '', rather than the last version's
      defaults
    - by changing to the above you can check to see if a file has a SAUCE
      record by checking the return of get_sauce_id() (eq 'SAUCE' -> yes,
      else -> no)
