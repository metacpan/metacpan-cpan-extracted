Revision history for Finance-Bank-NetBranch

0.01    2006-06-13T23:00-0500
        First version, released on an unsuspecting world.

0.02    2006-06-14T23:06-0500
        Cleaned up some POD, added support for getting transaction history.
        Currently, every action requires a login and a logout, now performed by
        private helpers; I would like to see a way to handle the session
        timeout and login only when necessary.

        Fixed silly bug in regular expression parsing of balances that would
        have failed for negative numbers; added "non-greedy" attribute to some
        regex atoms in transaction parser (not really necessary, but slightly
        safer and parallel with balance parser). Made method PODs parallel
        throughout.

        I think this fixes the Test::Pod::Coverage test breakage.

0.05    2006-06-18T17:52-0500
        Bothered to read the test failure report and realized I hadn't covered
        pad0() and that my POD was broken. If I would just get
        Test::Pod::Coverage and Test::Pod installed on this machine, I suppose
        this might not happen.

0.06    2006-06-27T22:33-0500
        One of these days I'll get the test-before-deployment idea down. Read
        cpan-testers failure report, fixed POD bug.

        Don't parse (as much) HTML by hand (a really bad idea, as I should have
        known, it caused this module to break very easily). Update LICENSE in
        Makefile.PL; remove seconds from Changes timestamp (silly me doing such
        things by hand), checked this into the http://svn.kulp.ch/cpan/
        Subversion repository, make other piddling changes to the code. More
        code needs to be moved away from manual parsing, but the critical
        sections have been fixed.
