NAME
    Path::Hilbert::XS - XS implementation of a Hilbert Path algorithm

SYNOPSIS
        use Path::Hilbert::XS;

        my ($x, $y) = d2xy(16, 127);
        my $d = xy2d(16, $x, $y);
        die unless $d == 127;

DESCRIPTION
    This implements Path::Hilbert in XS for speed and awesomesauceness.

    The OO interface is not available (yet?).

WHY
    While Path::Hilbert is a solid module, we just wanted speed when dealing
    with abundant amount of data.

    Here are some statistics, generated using the bundled tools/benchmark.pl
    script:

        -- d2xy --
        PP: Rounded run time per iteration: 1.4496e-05 +/- 4.8e-08 (0.3%)

            Time       PP      XS
        PP  1.450e-05  --      -3.53%
