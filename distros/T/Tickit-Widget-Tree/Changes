Revision history for Tickit-Widget-Tree

0.114     2015-02-06 19:37:36+00:00 Europe/London
	No new features.

	Bugs fixed:
	* Ensure we always report our keypress events as handled, to avoid focus leakage

0.113     2015-02-04 01:39:21+00:00 Europe/London
	No new features.

	Bugs fixed:
	* Remove some stray warnings

0.112     2015-01-25 18:08:12+00:00 Europe/London
	Features:
	* ->add_node_under_parent to allow adding complex data structures - this is an extension
	of the handling that we already had in place for ->new(data => ...)

	Bug fixes:
	* Scalar::Util wasn't being loaded, needed for blessed()
	* Supports 0 or '' as the single item to add in ->new(data => 0)

	Dependencies:
	* Log::Any, used for flagging exceptions that weren't previously being reported (eventually
	this will be used for tracing when debug/verbose flags are enabled, since Tickit::Debug hooks
	are better suited to Tickit core features)

0.111     2015-01-25 15:45:07+00:00 Europe/London
	Features:
	* Support Adapter::Async::OrderedList instances in initial data structure

0.110     2015-01-25 15:05:27+00:00 Europe/London
	Features:
	* Ability to attach Adapter::Async::OrderedList instances to nodes, for live updates

0.109     2015-01-24 14:05:05+00:00 Europe/London
	Features:
	* Cursor is now hidden by default
	* Rendering changes - root node has a vertical line off the top
	of the window, and nodes with no children have a half-width
	joining line.

0.108     2014-08-30 02:15:42+01:00 Europe/London
	Features:
	* Provides ->position_adapter for monitoring current tree position

	Dependencies:
	* Dropped Term::Termkey dependency which was previously used for
	the "control" modifier key (now available directly from Tickit).

0.107     2014-08-23 02:34:40+01:00 Europe/London
	Features:

	* Provide a default Tree::DAG_Node object if not specified in the
	constructor.
	* Allow separate label and toggle button (+/-) styles

	Bug fixes:
	* Fixed some rendering glitches
	* Don't allow root highlight, since it's never visible

0.101     2013-09-14 01:28:37 Europe/London
	New features:
	* Cursor is in a slightly less confusing location
	* CAN_SCROLL support (for embedding in Tickit::Widget::ScrollBox)

	Examples:
	* Scrolling example added, requires Tickit::Widget::ScrollBox

	Bug fixes:
	* Sizing was incorrect in the last version - the cols value was
	stored as lines as well :(

0.100     2013-09-13 22:47:38 Europe/London
	Version bump for non-DEV release.

	New features:
	* highlight_node event invoked when the currently-selected node is changed.
	Currently undocumented since the API may change slightly after some more
	testing.

0.090_002 2013-09-13 22:41:34 Europe/London
	New features:
	* Navigate to parent node via <Left>, first child via <Right> for quicker
	keyboard-only access
	* Calculate real size rather than using placeholder values of 1 line, 1 col,
	allowing widgets such as ScrollBox to work correctly.

	Bug fixes:
	* 'next row' logic would wrap to top of tree rather than stopping at the
	end of the tree
	* "Avoid" (as opposed to "fix") flood of warnings from Tickit::Window->restore

0.090_001 2013-09-11 01:30:30 Europe/London
	NOTE: This is a complete rewrite, and now uses Tree::DAG_Node for most of the
	important parts. Most old methods for navigating the tree have been removed as
	a consequence.

	New features:
	* Tickit::Style support
	* Render lines using Tickit::RenderBuffer
	* Mouse support

0.003     2012-01-24 00:20:31 Europe/London
	New features:
	 * Support widget for label rather than plain text
	 * Support different pens for highlight and regular label
	 * Adjust style handling so we have all strings in one place

	Bug fixes:
	 * Resolved some rendering artifacts when opening/closing tree nodes
	 * Fixed some undef warnings

	Backwards compatibility:
	 * Removed the following methods which were used for internal housekeeping:
	   * is_valid_tree_node

0.002     2012-01-21 23:10:42 Europe/London
	Inherit open/closed state from parent if not otherwise specified.
	Clean up styling for single line layout.
