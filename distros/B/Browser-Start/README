NAME

    Browser::Start - Open a URL in a web browser

VERSION

    version 0.01

SYNOPSIS

     use Browser::Start;
     
     open_url 'http://metacpan.org';

DESCRIPTION

    Simple interface for opening a URL in a browser appropriate for the
    system and user configuration.

FUNCTIONS

 open_url

     open_url $url;

    Opens the given URL in a browser. If this module doesn't know how to
    open a URL in your configuration or if this module can determine that
    the URL didn't open correctly then an exception will be thrown.

    This function is fire-and-forget, that is it won't interrupt your
    script. The browser should open the URL in a separate windows, or tab
    of an existing window.

CAVEATS

    There is a lot of variability in environments, so doing this correctly
    everywhere is a huge challenge. The distribution for this module will
    do what it can to fail loudly when it knows it won't work, rather than
    silently fail, so you may at least to some extent rely on this module
    if it installed correctly.

    Some environments may be configured to use non-browsers for some URL
    times. An FTP or sftp URL might open in some sort of file transfer
    client.

SEE ALSO

    Browser::Open

      This module provides a similar functionality.

      It doesn't support some platforms like OpenBSD and NetBSD which
      honestly should be treated similar to Linux and FreeBSD.

      It is more aggressive than I think it should be about choosing
      specific browsers that may or may not have been configured by users
      or normal system defaults.

      It may open URLs using console browsers like lynx which can muck up
      your Perl script.
