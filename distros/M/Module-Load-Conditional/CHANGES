  setting uptodate accordingly.

0.30    Mon Jan 19 16:25:55 CET 2009

* This is a test-suite fix release only. Users of
  0.28 need not upgrade.
* Address #42140: 01_Module_Load_Conditional.t support
  VMS in UNIX compatible mode.
* Address #42282: test fail on MSWin32

0.28    Wed Dec 17 13:54:17 CET 2008

* Add the directory the package was found in to the
  return value of check_install()

0.26    Fri Feb 29 16:01:15 CET 2008

* Address #32817: $INC{'Module/Load/Conditional.pm'}
  isn't canonicalized under Win32. This exposed an
  issue in the test suite under ActivePerl for Win32,
  but not the code itself.
  Users of 0.24 do not need to upgrade.

0.24    Wed Jan  2 16:53:19 CET 2008

* Readdress #29348 to make sure version comparisons
  handle alpha versions (XX_YY type) gracefully.

0.22    Mon Oct 15 10:10:21 CEST 2007

  0.20 installed do not need to upgrade. This is merely
  a test suit portability fix for perl 5.005

0.21_01 Fri Oct 12 10:48:06 CEST 2007

* Patch to make test-suite work with 5.005 weirdness
  as reported by Slaven Rezic.

0.20    Wed Oct  3 16:24:46 CEST 2007

* Update directory depth of test files to be less
  than 8 under perl core for old VAX and VMS
  compatibility. Users who have installed 0.18 do
  not need to upgrade.

0.18    Sat Sep 15 14:22:23 CEST 2007

* Promoted 0.17_02 to stable.

0.17_02 Fri Sep 14 11:55:52 CEST 2007

* Some more VMS fixes as suggested by John Malmberg
* Address #29348: Version compare logic doesn't
  handle alphas? by always using qv() to compare
  version strings.

0.17_01 Sun Sep  9 11:55:54 CEST 2007

* Most VMS specifics can now be removed from the
  test suite, as we now depend on a newer version
  of Module::Load, which will hide this all away.

0.16    Thu Jan 25 22:24:36 CET 2007

* Address #23995: Version parsing code has been
  improved and now partly relies on version.pm.
  Previously, versions declared with qv() or
  ($VERSION) (note the braces) could fail to
  parse under certain conditions.
* Add 02_Parse_Version.t to specifically test for
  this behaviour.

0.14    Wed Jan  3 18:27:36 CET 2007

* Skip $VERSION declarations that are part of the
  POD as reported in #24062

0.12    Sun Aug 13 14:55:54 CEST 2006

* Make %INC look ups work correctly under win32,
  where the directory seperator is not the same
  as the %INC path seperator
