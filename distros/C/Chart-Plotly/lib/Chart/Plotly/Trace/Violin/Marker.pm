But I think plotly.js is a great library and I want to use it with perl.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 TO_JSON

Serialize the trace to JSON. This method should be called only by L<JSON> serializer.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=over

=item * color

Sets themarkercolor. It accepts either a specific color or an array of numbers that are mapped to the colorscale relative to the max and min values of the array or relative to `marker.cmin` and `marker.cmax` if set.

=item * line

=item * opacity

Sets the marker opacity.

=item * outliercolor

Sets the color of the outlier sample points.

=item * size

Sets the marker size (in px).

=item * symbol

Sets the marker symbol type. Adding 100 is equivalent to appending *-open* to a symbol name. Adding 200 is equivalent to appending *-dot* to a symbol name. Adding 300 is equivalent to appending *-open-dot* or *dot-open* to a symbol name.
