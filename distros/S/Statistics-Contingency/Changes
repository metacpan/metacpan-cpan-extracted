Revision history for Perl extension Statistics::Contingency.

0.09 - Sat Jun  8 22:39:02 CDT 2013

 - Converted to Git and Dist::Zilla.  Moved from Google Code to GitHub.

0.08 - Sat Aug 23 22:20:30 2008

 - Fix a "can't take log of 0" error that sometimes happens when
   printing the stats_table(). [Erik Aronesty & Jochen Leidner]

0.07 - Tue Jun 10 20:44:58 2008

 - Added a set_entries() method to directly set the four entries of
   the contingency table.

 - Added a Build.PL as an alternative installer to the Makefile.PL.

0.06  Sat Feb  8 12:18:54 CST 2003

 - The output of stats_table() will now auto-expand to show 3
   significant digits in all data elements, or however many is
   specified as an argument to the method.

 - Added a note in the documentation pointing out the fact that
   micro_accuracy is always equal to macro_accuracy, and micro_error
   is always equal to macro_error.

0.05  Wed Oct 30 18:47:17 AEST 2002

 - Since miE and maE are the same, don't print both in the
   stats_table() method.  Just call it 'Err'.

0.04  Wed Sep 18 19:06:01 AEST 2002

 - A precision edge case has been changed.  Now, if no categories were
   assigned, and some categories should have been assigned, the
   precision is returned as 0.  Previous versions returned 1.  This
   edge case isn't discussed in the literature I've seen.  Note that
   with this change, the macro-precision will typically be reported as
   a lower number than before (but the micro-precision usually won't
   change).  Recall and F1 aren't affected by this change (they're
   both still 0), nor are error and accuracy.

 - Tests have been added to ensure the above changes stick.

0.03  Wed Aug  7 23:53 AEST 2002

 - Corrected some documentation errors

 - Added Params::Validate to the dependency list in Makefile.PL

0.02  Fri Jul 19 13:53:00 2002

 - Calling add_result() will now delete any cached calculations, so you
   can check the various metrics while you add results iteratively.
