Revision history for jQuery-File-Upload

0.01    Date/time
        First version, released on an unsuspecting world.

0.02

	added methods data and relative_url_path

0.03

	added methods thumbnail_upload_dir, thumbnail_url_base, and thumbnail_url_base. Also fixed
	bug where if thumbnail_prefix was set to '' and thumbnail and original filenames were the same,
  then the original file would overwrite the thumbnail.

0.04

	pod test failed, so I fixed it. Was missing documentation for these two methods:

	show_client_filename
	thumbnail_quality

	Also, added a little bit about how you can get access to the ctx object in the PRE/POST METHODS section.

0.05

	added thumbnail_postfix method

0.06

  added relative_to_host method

0.07 

  added require_image method

0.08

	fixed issue where if should_delete was set to 0 and handle_request was called with a 1, would not handle response correctly because it would never get to print_response call

0.09

	fixed issue where the _clear method would delete some initial passed in values, such as filename and thumbnail_filename

0.10

  fixed issue where calling generate_output may cause an error depending on what you passed into it (essentially if _set_uri ended up not being called). Fixed this by calling it manually.

0.11

  added delete_params as an option for generate_output method
	fixed issue where calling generate_output would generate null for delete urls if there was more than one file to generate it for. (needed to reset delete_url each time around loop)

0.12

	fixed _set_uri to use Catalyst URI if it already exists. Also, fixed issue where uri was being reused to generate delete_url in _delete_url if generate_output was passed more than one file.

0.13

	fixed issue where IE needs the content-type to be text/plain. suggested by this bug: https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=84300&results=fcb4720e2a3df735d29b41e959a7c5af
