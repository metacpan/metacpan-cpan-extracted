      This was the rt #86413

0.11.1 2012-06-25

    - The get() method now checks the underlying response code,
      and only returns success if the request really was successful.
      This makes all tests pass cleanly.
    - In Makefile.PL the runtime required modules were listed as
      build requirements. Changed them to be runtime requirements.
    - Data::Dumper wasn't listed as a runtime requirement.
    - Bugfix: rt #77727: -T in test scripts causes test failures

      as they were cut&paste from proxy method

    - get() wasn't croak'ing for non 2xx status codes, which was causing
      some of the tests to fail
