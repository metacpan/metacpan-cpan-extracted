Tk-Dressing

Tk::Dressing allows you to set a theme (a dressing) in your widget by using one of different default themes or by loading a new theme. 


How to participate to module to increase number of default themes ?

The first aim of Tk::Dressing is to allow user to choose between the proposed theme. But it is important 
for Tk::Dressing to propose a lot of default themes then, your help is welcome. 

Send me a .ini file and the name of your theme by email or through the web 
interface at : L<http://rt.cpan.org/NoAuth/ReportBug.html?Queue=Tk-Dressing>. 
I will add it in the module in a new release. It will be notified in Change file.
