=head1 Alien::TinyCC

A Perl Alien module for the Tiny C Compiler. This Perl distribution
distributes and contains the build steps necessary to ensure that the
Tiny C Compiler is available on your system.

=head1 INSTALLATION

I assume that if you are installing this module, you are doing so from
CPAN. The usual Module::Build incantation shold work:

 perl Build.PL
 ./Build
 ./Build test
 ./Build install

On Windows, you should omit the C<./> part of the C<Build> commands.

=head1 DEVELOPMENT

If you want to work on Alien::TCC itself, you will need to work with a clone of
this repository, as well as a clone of the tinycc subrepository. To set
everything up, create a F<Build> file and run the C<devsetup> command:

 perl Build.PL
 ./Build devsetup

The C<devsetup> command is essentially equivalent to

 git submodule init
 git submodule update
 cp git-pre-commit-hook.pl .git/hooks/pre-commit

The last bit, the commit hook, helps me keep the Changes file up-to-date. :-)

Also, C<devclean> and C<devrealclean> will restore the contents of F<src/> to 
their original state, and should be used instead of Build command C<clean> and 
C<realclean>.
