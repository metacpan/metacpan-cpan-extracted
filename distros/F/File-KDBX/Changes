Revision history for File-KDBX.

0.906     2022-08-16 19:44:09-0600
  * Fixed bug where dumping a fresh database could write wrong-sized encryption IV, making the resulting
    serialization unreadable by some KeePass implementations. Thanks HIGHTOWE.
  * Fixed bugs preventing the use of memory protection with fresh databases. Thanks HIGHTOWE.
  * Fixed the transform_rounds method to work with Argon KDF; this now maps to the Argon iterations value if
    the current KDF is Argon. Thanks HIGHTOWE.
