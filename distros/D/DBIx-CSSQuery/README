DBIx::CSSQuery
==============

DBIx::CSSQuery is, currently, a proof of concept for what can be done
with CSS query. For example, here's how you retrieve a collection of
all records from table "posts":

    db("posts")

Also, here's how to iterate over a collection:

    db("posts")->each(sub {
        my $item = shift;

        print $item->{body};
    });

It's also yet-another DBI abstraction layer of Perl module.
