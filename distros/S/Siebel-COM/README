Siebel-COM version 0.02
=======================

Siebel-COM was developed to make it easier to use Microsoft COM to access a Siebel application, 
either a Siebel Enterprise or a Siebel Client, without having to go down the details of Win32::OLE.

Inspiration for this distribution came from the article 

http://jbrazile.blogspot.com.br/2008/03/siebel-com-programming-with-perl.html 

wrote by Jason Brazile and the despicable information in the documentation 

http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E14004_01/books/OIRef/OIRef_About_Object_Interfaces_and_Programming_Environment6.html#wp1026164

of Oracle saying that Perl cannot be used to connected to Siebel with COM.
