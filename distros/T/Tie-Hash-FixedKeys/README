NAME

  Tie::Hash::FixedKeys

DESCRIPTION

WHAT IS Tie::Hash::FixedKeys?

  Tie::Hash::FixedKeys is a Perl module which extends the functionality of
  Perl hashes so that they can have a fixed set of keys.

HOW DO I INSTALL IT?

  Tie::Hash::FixedKeys uses the standard Perl module architecture and can 
  therefore be installed using the standard Perl method which, in brief,
  goes	something like this:

       gzip -cd Tie-Hash-FixedKeys-X.XX.tar.gz | tar xvf -
       cd Tie-Hash-FixedKeys-X.XX
       perl Makefile.PL
       make
       make test
       make install


  Where X.XX is the version number of the module which you are	installing.

  If this doesn't work for you then creating a directory called Tie/Hash 
  somewhere in your Perl library path (@INC) and copying the FixedKeys.pm
  file	into this directory should also do the trick.

WHERE IS THE DOCUMENTATION?

  All of the documentation is currently in POD format in the FixedKeys.pm
  file. If you install the module using the standard method you should be
  able to read it by typing

       perldoc Tie::Hash::FixedKeys


  at a command prompt.

LATEST VERSION

  The latest version of this module will always be available from  CPAN.
