NAME
    MooseX::LvalueAttribute - lvalue attributes for Moose

SYNOPSIS
       package MyThing;
   
       use Moose;
       use MooseX::LvalueAttribute;
   
       has name => (
          traits      => ['Lvalue'],
          is          => 'rw',
          isa         => 'Str',
          required    => 1,
       );
   
       has size => (
          traits      => ['Lvalue'],
          is          => 'rw',
          isa         => 'Int',
          default     => 0,
       );
   
       package main;
   
       my $thing = MyThing->new(name => 'Foo');
   
       $thing->name = "Bar";
       print $thing->name;   # Bar
   
       $thing->size++;
       print $thing->size;   # 1

DESCRIPTION
    This package provides a Moose attribute trait that provides Lvalue
    accessors. Which means that instead of writing:

       $thing->name("Foo");

    You can use the more natural looking:

       $thing->name = "Foo";

    For details of Lvalue implementation in Perl, please see:
    <http://perldoc.perl.org/perlsub.html#Lvalue-subroutines>

    Type constraints and coercions still work for lvalue attributes. Triggers
    still fire. Everything should just work. (Unless it doesn't.)

    You can optionally import a constants called `lvalue` that expands to the
    full name of the attribute trait, allowing:

       use MooseX::LvalueAttribute 'lvalue';
   
       has name => (
          traits      => [ lvalue ],
          is          => 'rw',
          isa         => 'Str',
          required    => 1,
       );

    This may allow Moose to compile your attribute very, very, slightly
    faster, but the main advantage is aesthetic.
