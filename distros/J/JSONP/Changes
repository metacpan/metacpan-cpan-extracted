1.83

1.82
	- add _is_root_element key to $self in run sub instead of doing it in constructor new sub

1.81
	- exclude colons as well from allowed chars for keys in autovivification

1.80

	- add couple tests

1.79
	- remove forgotten $VERSION print

1.78
	- allow much greater character set extent for keys in autovivification notation convenience. Now can be any Unicode codepoint that is not a POSIX punctuation char or control char, up to 1024 Unicode chars
	- now boolean evaluation context does not turn anymore booleans into referenced scalars (bug)

1.77
	- allow much greater character set extent for keys in autovivification notation convenience. Now can be any Unicode letter, number, and spacing, up to 2048 Unicode chars
	- increase allowed lenght for req and callback names to 64 ASCII chars
	- now graft/stack calls do not assume anymore to be feeded with utf8 text

1.76
	- always serialize as ASCII with "\uxyzw" escaping for non-ascii chars to prevent any corruption for data traversing non-utf8 compatibile media streams 
	- graft will keep to assume encoded UTF-8 JSON strings according to Postel's principle

1.75
	- fix bug on serialize when "pretty" is not defined

1.74
	- fix bug on serialize defaulting to "pretty" to true - thanks Robert Acock for reporting it

1.73
	- corrections on this "Changes" file and some typos in POD

1.70
	- make JSONP compatible with perlcritic
	- fixed bug where JSONP returning 'true' and 'false' strings instead of true and false JSON values - thanks Robert Acock
	- fixed bug preventing serialization of array nodes - thanks Robert Acock
	- addition of "file" method call, more flexible than "sendfile" one, courtesy of Robert Acock
	- addition of "pretty" call
	- slight performance improvement in _bless_tree - thanks Robert Acock
	- slight performance improvement in TO_JSON when serializing arrays - thanks Robert Acock

1.61
	- fixed a bug preventing replacement of a leaf with a new node
	- introduction of pretty method call
	- updated changelog and POD documentation
	- addition of first battery of tests

1.60
	- now detecting boolean context, within it the deserialized JSON booleans ( \1 and \0 ) are recognized and can be used directly in conditionals without need to dereference them
	- application/json content type now always recognized in POSTs and PUTs
	- now returning "unclassified error" to frontend if sandboxed evalation crashes, in debug mode the eval error string will also be returned
	- now mime type of downloadable files will always be set to application/octet-stream instead of specific detected type
	- JSON serialization routine has been put inside an eval to prevent any crash due to corrupted/invalid UTF-8 text encoding in Perl data structures

1.55
	- renamed clashing error method with raiseError, addition of module version property in debug mode

1.53
	- fix bug about method having the same name of object property

1.5.2
	- explicitly ignore callback values when call isn't a GET

1.5
	- now autovivification a tree with the convenience feature and passing an undef to last element makes it a zero length string instead of a reference to a void hash
	- fixed a runtime error occurring with undefined Content Types

1.4.2
	- now regeneration of session cookie is forced upon login (call to plugged login sub)

1.4.1
	- the module now returns correctly a meaningful error when submitted JSON (with application/json mimetype) is of an array type

1.4
	- added transparent support for POSTs and PUTs of application/json or application/javascript type

1.3.1
	- fixed bug: now mimetype for plain json is application/json, together application/javascript for JSONP
	- little bug fixes for corner cases
	
1.3
	- fixed bug: Content-Disposition was not correctly set on file download
	- fixed bug: null req parameter no longer cause a runtime error, a nice error message is returned instead
	- plain_json method is now deprecated, JSONP will behave automatically accordingly with callback parameter existence in request query

1.2
	- fix of a bug converting void arrays in null on serialization to json

1.1
	- addition of "append" method, removal of imported methods from CGI

1.0
	- fix regression causing HTTP 500 because references to login and aaa sub were not skipped during serialization

0.99

0.98
	- updated POD documentation - added module Want as dependency

0.97
	- use ExtUtils::MakeMaker for ditribution build

0.96

0.93
	- do not return underscore keys on serialization

0.92
	- addition of alternatives syntax for "use VERSION" for stubborn old perl compilers

0.91
	- management of JSON encoding of JSONP-blessed arrays in tree, allowance of "session" and "params" keys in elements tree deeper than the highest one

0.89
	- version numbers...

0.88
	- corrections to POD syntax

0.87
	- fixed typo on logout sub member variable when passed by name

0.86

0.85
	- found and resolved bug that was returning blessed objects instead of actual leaf value, in special "Want" case, resolved bug about undefined _debug attribute

0.84
	- found and resolved the dreaded bug that was turning null strings in blessed objects, some other code cleanup

0.83
	- addition of serialize method, to directly export an object branch into a JSON string

0.82
	- addition of graft method, to directly slurp JSON strings as subtree objects

0.81
	- automatic bless upon assignment of array structures too

0.80
	- made Want module usage optional
	- made contructor as lightweight as possible deferring properties settings to last minute
	- decoupled Want module usage from constructor
	- automatic bless of trees assigned with lvalue notation

0.79
	- added lvalue syntax for leaf assignments, leaf-to-node substituction by Want module usage, non-web instantiation

0.78
	- added TO_JSON for booleans and a warnings about using undefs with convenience notation feature

0.77
	- typo in this very file

0.76
