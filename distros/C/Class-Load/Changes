Revision history for Class-Load

0.25     2018-06-10 20:55:10Z
    - merged required and recommended Data::OptList version prerequisite, to
      work around CPAN.pm bug (RT#123447)

0.24     2017-04-10 21:12:31Z
    - fix test to handle altered Test::Without::Module exception message
      (PR#2, Paul Howarth)

0.23     2015-06-25
    - remove use of namespace::clean

0.22     2014-08-16
    - document some of the caveats to using this module, and refer to
      Module::Runtime as an alternative

0.21     2014-02-09
    - repository moved to the github moose organization

0.20     2012-07-15

- Same as the most recent 0.19, but with a new version number.

0.19     2012-07-15

- Uploaded by Dave Rolsky, not realizing 0.19 was already used

- The load_class() subroutine now returns the class name on success. Requested
  by Caleb Cushing. RT #76931.

- Exceptions and errors from Class::Load no longer contain references to line
  numbers in Class::Load or Module::Runtime. This applies to exceptions thrown
  by load_class, load_first_existing_class, and load_optional_class, as well
  as the error returned by try_load_class.

- Exceptions are now croaked properly so they appear to come from the calling
  code, not from an internal subroutine. This makes the exceptions look more
  like the ones thrown by Perl's require. RT #68663.

0.19     2012-04-03

- Uploaded by doy (Jesse Luehrs)

- No changes, reupload to fix indexing.

0.18     2012-02-18

- Require Package::Stash 0.14+. Fixes RT #75095. Reported by Zefram.

0.17     2012-02-12

- A bug in Class::Load caused test failures when Module::Runtime 0.012 was
  used with Perl 5.8.x. Reported by Zefram. RT #74897. ( Jesse Luehrs )

0.16     2012-02-12

- Require Module::Runtime 0.012, which has a number of useful bug fixes.

0.15     2012-02-08

- Small test changes to accomodate latest version of
  Module::Implementation. There's no need to upgrade if you're already using
  0.14

0.14     2012-02-06

- Use Module::Implementation to handle loading the XS or PP versions of the
  code. Using this module fixes a few bugs.

- Under taint mode, setting an implementation in the CLASS_LOAD_IMPLEMENTATION
  env var caused a taint error.

- An invalid value in the CLASS_LOAD_IMPLEMENTATION env var is now detected
  and reported immediately. No attempt is made to load an invalid
  implementation.

0.13     2011-12-22

- Fix some bugs with our use of Try::Tiny. This could cause warnings on some
  systems with Class::Load::XS wasn't installed. Fixes RT #72345.

0.12     2011-10-25

- Depend on Module::Runtime 0.011+. This fixes problems with Catalyst under
  Perl 5.8 and 5.10.

0.11     2011-10-04

- Don't accept package names that start with a digit. ( Jesse Luehrs )

- Rewrote some of the guts to use Module::Runtime, rather than reimplementing
  its functionality. ( Jesse Luehrs )

0.10     2011-09-06

- Make sure the $@ localization doesn't hide errors - invalid module name
  errors were being suppressed on perls before 5.14. ( Jesse Luehrs )

0.09     2011-09-05

- Fix is_class_loaded to ignore $ISA (but still look for @ISA) when trying to
  determine whether a class is loaded. ( Jesse Luehrs )

- Lots of internals cleanup. ( Jesse Luehrs )

0.08     2011-08-15

- The previous version was missing a prereq declaration for
  Data::OptList. Reported by Daisuke Maki and Mark Hedges. RT #70285.

0.07     2011-08-15

- All this module's subroutines now accept optional parameters for a module so
  you can write something like - load_class( 'Foo', { -version => 42 } )

- There is now a Class::Load::XS distro available on CPAN which implements
  some of this module's code in XS for speed. This code was originally written
  by Goro Fuji and Florian Ragwitz for Class::MOP. You need to install this
  distro explicitly if you want the XS implementation.

- Added a load_first_existing_class subroutine based, mostly borrowed from
  Class::MOP.

- Fixed a bug where a package with a version object in its $VERSION would not
  be seen as loaded. Reported by Chris Prather.

0.06     2010-11-15

- BACK COMPAT CHANGE: Remove $Class::Load::ERROR in favor of a contextual
  return value. ( Jesse Luehrs )

- Add load_optional_class($class) that fails only if there is a problem with
  the attempted-to-load $class. ( Kent Fredric )

- Force internal require to try-again if we are SURE the class is not
  there. This produces reliable errors. ( Kent Fredric )

- Replace Test::Exception with Test::Fatal ( Kent Fredric )

0.05     2009-09-02

- Cargo-cult Class::MOP's is_class_loaded so we work on 5.10

0.04     2008-11-09

- No changes

0.03     2008-11-09

- Dist fix

0.02     2008-11-09

- Declare dependency on Test::Exception

0.01     2008-08-13

- First version, released on an unsuspecting world.
