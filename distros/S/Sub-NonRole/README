NAME
    Sub::NonRole - prevent some subs from appearing in a role's API

SYNOPSIS
       package My::Role {
          use Moose::Role;
          use Sub::NonRole;
      
          sub some_function {
             ...;
          }
      
          sub other_function : NonRole {
             ...;
          }
       }
   
       package My::Class {
          use Moose;
          with 'My::Role';
       }
   
       My::Class->some_function();    # ok
       My::Class->other_function();   # no such method!

DESCRIPTION
    This module allows you to mark certain subs within a role as not being
    part of the role's API. This means that they will not be copied across
    into packages which consume the role.

    The subs can still be called as:

       My::Role->other_function();
       My::Role::other_function();

    It should work with Role::Tiny, Moo::Role, Moose::Role and
    MooseX::Role::Parameterized roles.

  Developer API
    `Sub::NonRole->setup_for($role)`
        If you wish to import the Sub::NonRole functionality into another
        package, this is how to do it.

    `$role->meta->non_role_methods`
        For Moose roles (but not Moo or Role::Tiny ones) you can access the
        `non_role_methods` attribute on the role's meta object to get an
        arrayref of non-role method names.

BUGS
    Currently when consuming a Moo role within a Moose class, Sub::NonRole can
    cause a warning to be issued in the global cleanup phase. This is unlikely
    to result in serious problems; it's just annoying.

    In older Perls (before 5.10.1 I believe), importing Sub::Role into a
    package without actually applying the attribute to any subs can cause a
    crash with the error message *Internal error: Your::Package symbol went
    missing*. Once you've applied the `:NonRole` attribute to a sub,
    everything should be OK.

    Please report any other bugs to
