Data-Structure-Compare

use Data::Structure::Compare qw(structure_compare);

my $data1 = { 1 => { 2 => 3} };
my $data2 = { 1 => { 2 => 4} };

if (structure_compare($data1, $data2) == 1) {
    print '$data1 and $data2 have same structure';
}

When we validate some data with same XSD rules, We need only compare the structure.

When we compare two complex data structure, it is difficult to compare one
by one key and value.

Test::Deep only could compare same structure with same value.
sometimes we only need compare structure.
