NAME

    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Apocalyptic - Let the apocalypse build your
    dist!

VERSION

      This document describes v0.005 of Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Apocalyptic - released October 28, 2014 as part of Dist-Zilla-PluginBundle-Apocalyptic.

DESCRIPTION

    This plugin bundle attempts to automate as much as sanely possible the
    job of building your dist. It builds upon Dist::Zilla and utilizes
    numerous plugins to reduce the burden on the programmer.

            # In your dist.ini:
            name = My-Super-Cool-Dist
            [@Apocalyptic]

    Don't forget the new global config.ini file added in Dist::Zilla v4!

    This is equivalent to setting this in your dist.ini:

Setting options

    However, this plugin bundle does A LOT of things, so you would need to
    read the config carefully to see if it does anything you don't want to
    do. You can override the options simply by removing the offending
    plugin from the bundle by using the Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Filter
    package. By doing that you are free to specify alternate plugins, or
    the desired plugin configuration manually.

            # In your dist.ini:
            name                    = My-Super-Cool-Dist
            author                  = A. U. Thor
            license                 = Perl_5
            copyright_holder        = A. U. Thor
    
            ; we don't want to archive our releases
            ; we want to push to gitorious instead
            [@Filter]
            bundle = @Apocalyptic
            remove = ArchiveRelease
            remove = Git::Push
            [Git::Push]
            push_to = gitorious

 Newer method to manipulate this bundle

    This PluginBundle now supports Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::ConfigSlicer,
    so you can pass in options to the plugins used like this:

            [@Apocalyptic]
            Git::Push.push_to = gitorious

    This PluginBundle also supports
    Dist::Zilla::Role::PluginBundle::PluginRemover, so dropping a plugin is
    as easy as this:

            [@Apocalyptic]
            -remove = ArchiveRelease

Future Plans

 use XDG's Twitter plugin

    I want to tweet and be a web2.0 dude! :)

 use GETTY's cool Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Run::AfterRelease

    I want to use that to automatically install the generated tarball

            sudo cpanp i --force file:///home/apoc/mygit/perl-dist-zilla-pluginbundle-apocalyptic/Dist-Zilla-PluginBundle-Apocalyptic-0.001.tar.gz

    However, how do I get the full tarball path?

 Work with Task::* dists

    From Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::FLORA

            ; Not sure if it supports config_plugin = @Bundle like PodWeaver does...
            [TaskWeaver]    ; weave our POD for a Task::* module ( enabled only if it's a Task-* dist )
    
            has is_task => (
                is      => 'ro',
                isa     => Bool,
                lazy    => 1,
                builder => '_build_is_task',
            );
    
            method _build_is_task {
                return $self->dist =~ /^Task-/ ? 1 : 0;
            }
    
            ...
    
            $self->is_task
            ? $self->add_plugins('TaskWeaver')
            : $self->add_plugins([ 'PodWeaver' => { config_plugin => '@FLORA' } ]);

 I would like to start digging into the dzil new command and see how to
 automate stuff in it.

  Changes creation

    create a Changes file with the boilerplate text in it

            Revision history for Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Apocalyptic
    
            {{$NEXT}}
    
                    initial release

  github integration

    automatically create github repo + set description/homepage via
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::UpdateGitHub and App::GitHub::create or
    App::GitHub

  gitorious integration

    unfortunately there's no perl API for gitorious?
    http://www.mail-archive.com/gitorious@googlegroups.com/msg01016.html

  .gitignore creation

    it should contain only one line - the damned dist build dir
    "/Foo-Dist-*" also, it needs the "/.build/" line?

  Eclipse files creation

    create the .project/.includepath/.settings stuff

  submit project to ohloh

    we need more perl projects on ohloh! there's WWW::Ohloh::API

 DZP::PkgDist

    Do we need the $DIST variable? What software uses it? I already provide
    that info in the POD of the file...
