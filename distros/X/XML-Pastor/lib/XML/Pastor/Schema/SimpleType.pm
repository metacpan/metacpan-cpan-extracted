=head1 NAME

B<XML::Pastor::Schema::SimpleType> - Class that represents the META information about a W3C schema simple type.

=head1 WARNING

This module is used internally by L<XML::Pastor>. You do not normally know much about this module to actually use L<XML::Pastor>.  It is 
documented here for completeness and for L<XML::Pastor> developers. Do not count on the interface of this module. It may change in 
any of the subsequent releases. You have been warned. 

=head1 ISA

This class descends from L<XML::Pastor::Schema::Type> and hence from <XML::Pastor::Schema::Object>.


=head1 SYNOPSIS
  
  my $type = XML::Pastor::Schema::SimpleType->new();
  
  $type->setFields(name => 'CountryCode', scope=> 'global', nameIsAutoGenerated=>0);
  $type->base('LocationCode');
  $type->derivedBy('restriction');
  
  print $type->name();	# prints 'CountryCode'.
  print $type->scope();	# prints 'global'.
  print $type->base();	# prints 'LocationCode'.
  print $type->derivedBy();	# prints 'restriction'.
  

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<XML::Pastor::Schema::SimpleType> is a data-oriented object class that reprsents a W3C Simple Type. It is
parsed from the W3C schema and is used a building block for the produced B<schema model>. It is also used 
embedded as class data within the simple classes generated by L<XML::Pastor>. This way, objects of this 
class contain META information about the W3C schema simple type that they represent. 

Like other schema object classes, this is a data-oriented object class, meaning it doesn't have many methods other 
than a constructor and various accessors. 

=head1 METHODS

=head2 CONSTRUCTORS
 
=head4 new() 

  $class->new(%fields)

B<CONSTRUCTOR>, overridden. 

The new() constructor method instantiates a new object. It is inheritable. 
  
Any -named- fields that are passed as parameters are initialized to those values within
the newly created object. 

In its overriden form, what this method does is to set the I<contentType> field to 'I<simple>'.

.

=head2 ACCESSORS

=head3 Inherited accessors

Several accessors are inherited by this class from its ancestors L<XML::Pastor::Schema::Type> and L<XML::Pastor::Schema::Object>. 
Please see L<XML::Pastor::Schema::Type> and L<XML::Pastor::Schema::Object> for a documentation of those.

=head3 Accessors defined here

=head4 enumeration()

  my $enum = $object->enumeration();	# GET
  $object->enumeration($enum);          # SET

This is a W3C facet. For more information please refer to W3C XML schema documentation.

Returns (GET) and expects (SET) a hash reference that represent the enumeration values that
the simple type can accept. The hash keys are the enumeration values and the hash values are all
set to 1. 

This accessor is created by a call to B<mk_accessors> from L<Class::Accessor>.

=head4 fractionDigits()

  my $fd = $object->fractionDigits();  # GET
  $object->fractionDigits($fd);        # SET

This is a W3C facet. For more information please refer to W3C XML schema documentation.

This field, if present, signifies the number of fractional digits that numeric values of this simple type 
must have. This is obtained directly from the W3C schema and placed here by the parser. It is later used for validation. 

This accessor is created by a call to B<mk_accessors> from L<Class::Accessor>.

=head4 length()

  my $len = $object->length();	# GET
  $object->length($len);        # SET

This is a W3C facet. For more information please refer to W3C XML schema documentation.

Returns (GET) and expects (SET) an integer value representing the exact string length of the 
simple type value must have for it to pass validation. 

This accessor is created by a call to B<mk_accessors> from L<Class::Accessor>.

=head4 itemType()

  my $it = $object->itemType();	# GET
  $object->itemType($it);        # SET

This is a W3C facet. For more information please refer to W3C XML schema documentation.

Returns (GET) and expects (SET) a string value that represents the type of the items in a 'B<list>' type. 
A W3C list type is a whitespace separeted list of tokens (called items) which must have a common atomic type. 
This value is obtained from the W3C schema by the parser and is later used for validation.

This accessor is created by a call to B<mk_accessors> from L<Class::Accessor>.
 
=head4 itemClass()

  my $cls = $object->itemClass();	# GET
  $object->itemClass($cls);        # SET

This is NOT a W3C facet. It is computed. 

Returns (GET) and expects (SET) a Perl Class name that represents the type of the items in a 'B<list>' type. 
A W3C list type is a whitespace separeted list of tokens (called items) which must have a common atomic type. 
This value is computed from the I<itemType> at schema model resolution time and is later used for validation.

This accessor is created by a call to B<mk_accessors> from L<Class::Accessor>.

=head4 maxExclusive()

  my $max = $object->maxExclusive();  # GET
  $object->maxExclusive($max);        # SET

must be less than. This is obtained directly from the W3C schema and placed here by the parser. It is later used for validation. 

This accessor is created by a call to B<mk_accessors> from L<Class::Accessor>.

can have. This is obtained directly from the W3C schema and placed here by the parser. It is later used for validation. 

This accessor is created by a call to B<mk_accessors> from L<Class::Accessor>.


=head4 maxLength()

can have. This is obtained directly from the W3C schema and placed here by the parser. It is later used for validation. 

This accessor is created by a call to B<mk_accessors> from L<Class::Accessor>.


=head4 memberTypes()

  my $mt = $object->memberTypes();	# GET
  $object->memberTypes($mt);        # SET

This is a W3C facet. For more information please refer to W3C XML schema documentation.

This is a whitespace separated list of member type names in the context of a W3C B<union>. 
The value is retrieved from the W3C schema and further enriched by the implicit (local) type 
names by the schema parser. It is later used for validation. 

This accessor is created by a call to B<mk_accessors> from L<Class::Accessor>.


=head4 memberClasses()

  my $mc = $object->memberClasses();  # GET
  $object->memberClasses($mc);        # SET

This is NOT a W3C facet. It is computed. 

This is a reference to an array of Perl classes each of which represent a I<type> mentioned 
in L</memberTypes()>.  So it makes sense only in a W3C B<union> context. The value is computed at 
schema model resolution time. It is later used for validation. 

This accessor is created by a call to B<mk_accessors> from L<Class::Accessor>.
