NAME

    Shell::POSIX::Select - The POSIX Shell's "select" loop for Perl

PURPOSE

    This module implements the "select" loop of the "POSIX" shells
    (Bash, Korn, and derivatives) for Perl.  That loop is unique in
    two ways: it's by far the friendliest feature of any UNIX shell,
    and it's the *only* UNIX shell loop that's missing from the Perl
    language.  Until now!

SYNOPSIS

    NOTE: In the following, the enclosing square brackets (not
    typed) identify optional elements, and vertical bars indicate
    mutually-exclusive choices:

    select [[my|local|our<]> scalar_var] ( [LIST] ) { [CODE] }

    The required elements are the keyword "select", the *parentheses*,
    and the *curly braces*.  See "SYNTAX" for details.

ELEMENTARY EXAMPLE

  ship2me2.plx

    use Shell::POSIX::Select qw($Heading $Prompt);

    $Heading='Select a Shipper' ;
    $Prompt='Enter Vendor Number: ' ;

    select $shipper ( 'UPS', 'FedEx' ) {
        print "\nYou chose: $shipper\n";
        last;
    }
    ship ($shipper, $ARGV[0]);      # prints confirmation message


  OUTPUT

    ship2me2.plx '42 hemp toothbrushes'

    *Select a Shipper*

    1) UPS  2) FedEx

    Enter Vendor Number: 2
    You chose: FedEx

    Your order has been processed.  Thanks for your business!

BENEFITS

    What's so great about this loop? It automates the generation of a
    numbered menu of choices, prompts for a choice, proofreads that
    choice and complains if it's invalid (at least in this enhanced
    implementation), and executes a code-block with a variable set to
    the chosen value.  That saves a lot of coding for interactive
    programs -- especially if the menu consists of many values!

    The benefit of bringing this loop to Perl is that it obviates the
    need for future programmers to reinvent the *Choose-From-A-Menu*
    wheel.

EXPORTS: Default

    $Reply

    This variable is "local"ized to each "select" loop, and provides
    the menu-number of the most recent valid selection.

EXPORTS: Optional

     $Heading
     $Prompt
     $Eof

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

    I probably never would have even attempted to write this module if
    it weren't for the provision of Filter::Simple by Damian Conway,
    which I ruthlessly exploited to make a hard job easy.

    *The Damian* also gave useful tips during the module's
    development, for which I'm grateful.

    I *definitely* wouldn't have ever written this module, if I hadn't
    found myself writing a chapter on *Looping* for my upcoming
    Manning Publications book, and once again lamenting the fact that
    the most friendly Shell loop was missing from Perl.  In a fit of
    zeal, I decided to rectify that oversight! 8-}

    For more examples of how this loop can be used in Perl programs,
    watch for my upcoming book, *Minimal Perl: for Shell Users and
    Programmers* (see <http://teachmeperl.com/mp4sh.html>) in early
    fall, 2003.

    names just happen to match up).
