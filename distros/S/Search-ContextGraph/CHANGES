0.15  8.14.2004

- Changed hard-coded 'D' and 'T' prefixing to use _nodeify subroutine
- Added connected_components method 
- Began adding support for file-based hashes using MLDBM, enabling very
	large collections.
- Minor bugfixes, now tests for D: and T: prefixes explicitly,
	instead of assuming that those are the only node types.
