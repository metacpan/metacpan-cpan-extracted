DBIx-Perlish version 0.64

DBIx::Perlish - a perlish interface to SQL databases.


DESCRIPTION

The DBIx::Perlish module provides the ability to work with databases
supported by the DBI module using Perl's own syntax for four most common
operations: SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE, and INSERT.

By using DBIx::Perlish, you can write most of your database queries
using a domain-specific language with Perl syntax.  Since a Perl
programmer knows Perl by definition, and might not know SQL to the same
degree, this approach generally leads to a more comprehensible and
maintainable code.

The module is not intended to replace 100% of SQL used in your program.
There is a hope, however, that it can be used to replace a substantial
portion of it.

The DBIx::Perlish module quite intentionally neither implements nor
cares about database administration tasks like schema design and
management.  The plain DBI interface is quite sufficient for that.
Similarly, and for the same reason, it does not take care of
establishing database connections or handling transactions.  All this is
outside the scope of this module.
