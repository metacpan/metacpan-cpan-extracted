Some experiments with hooks.

Hello world!

In this example, let us add a regex hook which may be useful in some
HTML documents.  The anonymous function takes $self as the first
argument, the second argument is the whole match, and other arguments
are parenthesized parts of the regular expression:


We will try this hook here:
<a name="overview"><h3>Document Overview</h3></a>
The next line.

Let us now experiment with removing and adding hooks.


<? echo "This should not work." !>
But, this should.
