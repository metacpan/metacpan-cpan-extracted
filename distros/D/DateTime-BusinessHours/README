DESCRIPTION
    BusinessHours a class for caculating the business hours between two
    DateTime objects. It can be useful in situations like escalation where
    an action has to happen after a certain number of business hours.

METHODS
  new( %args )
    This class method accepts the following arguments as parameters:

    *   datetime1 - Starting Date

    *   datetime2 - Ending Date

    *   worktiming - May be one of the following:

        *   An array reference with two values: starting and ending hour of
            the day

        *   An array reference of array references. Each reference being a
            slice of the 24-hour clock where business is conducted. Useful
            if you want to leave a "lunch hour" out of the calculation.
            Defaults to [ [ 9, 17 ] ]

    *   weekends - An array reference with values of the days that must be
        considered as non-working in a week. Defaults to [6,7] (Saturday &
        Sunday)

    *   holidays - An array reference with holiday dates in 'yyyy-mm-dd'
        format

    *   holidayfile - The name of a file from which predefined holidays can
        be excluded from business days/hours calculation. Defaults to no
        file

  calculate( )
    This will force a recalculation of the business hours and days. useful
    if you've changed any values (datetime1, datetime2, worktiming, etc) or
    updated the holiday file

  getdays( )
    Returns the number of business days

  gethours( )
    Returns the number of business hours.
