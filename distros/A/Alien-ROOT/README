NAME
    Alien::ROOT - Utility package to install and locate CERN's ROOT library

SYNOPSIS
      use Alien::ROOT;

      my $aroot = Alien::ROOT->new;

DESCRIPTION
    Installs or detects CERN's ROOT library.

    This version of "Alien::ROOT" will download and install "ROOT v5.30.0"
    if necessary. If an existing (and compatible) installation of ROOT was
    detected, the module will not download/compile/install a new version of
    ROOT.

METHODS
  Alien::ROOT->new
    Creates a new "Alien::ROOT" object, which essentially just has a few
    convenience methods providing useful information like the path to the
    ROOT installation ("ROOTSYS" environment variable) and the path to the
    root-config utility.

  $aroot->installed
    Determine if a valid installation of ROOT has been detected in the
    system. This method will return a true value if it is, or undef
    otherwise.

    Example code:

      print "okay\n" if $aroot->installed;

  $aroot->run
    Sets up the ROOT environment (see "setup_environment") and then invokes
    the ROOT shell by simply calling "root".

  $aroot->setup_environment
    Sets up the "PATH" and "LD_LIBRARY_PATH" environment variables to point
    at the correct paths for ROOT.

    Throws an exception if ROOT was not found, so wrap this in an "eval" or
    check "$aroot->installed" before using this.

  $aroot->version
    Determine the installed version of ROOT, as a string.

    Example code:

      my $version = $aroot->version;

  $aroot->ldflags
  $aroot->linker_flags
    This returns the flags required to link C code with the local
    installation of ROOT.

    Example code:

      my $ldflags = $aroot->ldflags;

  $aroot->cflags
  $aroot->compiler_flags
    This method returns the compiler option flags to compile C++ code which
    uses the ROOT library (typically in the CFLAGS variable).

    Example code:

      my $cflags = $aroot->cflags;

  $aroot->features
    This method returns a string of ROOT features that were enabled when
    ROOT was compiled.

    Example code:

      my $features = $aroot->features;
      if ($features !~ /\bexplicitlink\b/) {
        warn "ROOT was built without the --explicitlink option";
      }

  $aroot->bindir
    This method returns the path to the executable directory of ROOT.

    Example code:

      my $dir = $aroot->bindir;
      system(File::Spec->catfile($dir, 'root'));

  $aroot->libdir
    This method returns the path to the library (lib/) directory of ROOT.

    Example code:

      my $dir = $aroot->libdir;

  $aroot->incdir
    This method returns the path to the include directory of ROOT.

    Example code:

      my $dir = $aroot->incdir;

  $aroot->etcdir
    This method returns the path to the 'etc' directory of ROOT.

    Example code:

      my $dir = $aroot->etcdir;

  $aroot->private_root
    This method returns true if the copy of ROOT that is being used was
    installed by "Alien::ROOT" and is considered private.

    Example code:

      my $is_private = $aroot->private_root;
