NAME
    Marlin::XAttribute::LocalWriter - Marlin attribute extension for
    localizing attribute values.

SYNOPSIS
      package Local::Person {
        use Marlin::Util -all;
        use Types::Common -types;
        use Marlin
          name => {
            required       => true,
            isa            => Str,
            ':LocalWriter' => 'temp_name',
          };
      }
  
      my $bob = Local::Person->new( name => 'Bob' );
      say $bob->name;  # "Bob"
  
      {
        my $guard = $bob->temp_name( 'Robert' );
        say $bob->name;  # Robert
      }
  
      say $bob->name;  # "Bob"

IMPORTING THIS MODULE
    The standard way to import Marlin attribute extensions is to include them
    in the attribute definition hashrefs passed to `use Marlin`

      package Local::Person {
        use Marlin::Util -all;
        use Types::Common -types;
        use Marlin
          name => {
            required       => true,
            isa            => Str,
            ':LocalWriter' => 'temp_name',
          };
      }

    It is possible to additionally load it with `use
    Marlin::XAttribute::LocalWriter`, which won't *do* anything, but might be
    useful to automatic dependency analysis.

      package Local::Person {
        use Marlin::Util -all;
        use Marlin::XAttribute::LocalWriter;
        use Types::Common -types;
        use Marlin
          name => {
            required       => true,
            isa            => Str,
            ':LocalWriter' => 'temp_name',
          };
      }

DESCRIPTION
    The following are spiritually similar:

      {
        my $guard = $bob->temp_name( "Robert" );
        ...;
      }
  
      {
        local $bob->{name} = "Robert";
        ...;
      }

    However, the local writer method will honour type constraints, triggers,
    etc.

    Calling `$bob->temp_name()` with no parameters is equivalent to doing
    `delete local`.

    Note that the $guard which is returned by the method is where a lot of the
    magic happens. When it goes out of scope, it restores the original value.

    If you set `':LocalWriter' => 1`, this is a shortcut for `':LocalWriter'
    => "_local$attrname"` if your attribute's name starts with an underscore,
    and `':LocalWriter' => "local_$attrname"` otherwise.

    This extension makes no changes to your constructor.
