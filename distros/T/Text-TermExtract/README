NAME
    Text::TermExtract - Extract terms from text

SYNOPSIS
        use Text::TermExtract;

        my $text = { Hey, hey, how's it going? Wanna go to Wendy's 
                     tonight? Wendy's has great sandwiches." };

        my $ext = Text::TermExtract->new();

        for my $word ( $ext->terms_extract( $text, { max => 3 }) ) {
            print "$word\n";
        }

        # "sandwiches"
        # "tonight"
        # "wendy"

DESCRIPTION
    Text::TermExtract takes a simple approach at extracting the most
    interesting terms from documents of arbitrary length.

    There's more scientific methods to term extraction, like Yahoo's online
    term extraction API (but you can't have it locally) and the
    Lingua::YaTeA module on CPAN (which is so poorly documented that I
    couldn't figure out how to use it).

    So I wrote Text::TermExtract, which first tries to guess the language a
    text is written in, kicks out the language- specific stopwords, weighs
    the rest with a hand-crafted formula and returns a list of (hopefully)
    interesting words.

    This is a very crude approach to term extraction, if you have a better
    method and want to include it in Text::TermExtract, drop me an email,
    I'm interested.

  METHODS
    new()
        Constructor.

    terms_extract( $text, $opts )
        Goes through the text stringin $text, extracts the keywords and
        returns them as a list.

        To limit the number of words returned, use the "max" option:

            $extr->terms_extract( $text, { max => 10 } );

    exclude( $array_ref )
        Add a list of words to exclude. The words listed in the array passed
        in as a reference will never be used as keywords.

            $extr->exclude( ['moe', 'joe'] );
