NAME
    Filter::Dockerfile - Dockerfile preprocessor

SYNOPSIS
        $ perl -MFilter::Dockerfile Dockerfile.pre > Dockerfile

        # Dockerfile Syntax:
        INCLUDE ./Dockerfile.inc
        INCLUDE http://path/to/Dockerfile.inc
        INCLUDE ./Dockerfile.inc http://path/to/Dockerfile.inc

        INCLUDE MERGE a.inc b.inc

DESCRIPTION
    "Filter::Dockerfile" was written to allow simple pre-processing of
    Dockerfiles to add capabilities currently unsupported by docker build.

INSTRUCTIONS
  INCLUDE [MERGE] [FILTERS] [file|uri] ...
    This will inline a file or uri into the Dockerfile being generated.

   MERGE
    When including multiple Dockerfile snippets this will attempt to merge
    common instructions. Currently only ENV, LABEL and RUN are merged,
    otherwise multiple instructions will be repeated. RUN instructions are
    merged with "&&" while other instructions are merged with a space.
