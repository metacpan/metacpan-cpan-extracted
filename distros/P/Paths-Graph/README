WHAT IS Paths/Graph?

This is Graph.pm, an easy for finding path in the graph.

The README is used to introduce the module and provide instructions on
how to install the module, any machine dependencies it may have (for
example C compilers and installed libraries) and any other information
that should be provided before the module is installed.

A README file is required for CPAN modules since CPAN extracts the
README file from a module distribution so that people browsing the
archive can use it get an idea of the modules uses. It is usually a
good idea to provide version information here so that people can
decide whether fixes for the module are worth downloading.

HOW DO I INSTALL IT?

To install this module, cd to the directory that contains this README
file and type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

This module not requires these other modules and libraries exept the some perl. 

WHERE ARE THE EXAMPLES?

A collection of examples demonstrating various utils features and
techniques are in the directory "examples".  

WHERE CAN I LEARN MORE?

Books of Tree on techniques of structure programming.

NAME

Path::Graph - Generate paths from hash graph.

SYNOPSIS

#!usr/bin/perl

my %graph = (
                A => {B=>1,C=>4},
                B => {A=>1,C=>2},
                C => {A=>4,B=>2}

);

use Paths::Graph;
my $g = Paths::Graph->new(-origin=>"A",-destiny=>"C",-graph=>\%graph);
my @paths = $g->shortest_path();
for my $path (@paths) {
        print "Shortest Path:" . join ("->" , @$path) . " Cost:". $g->get_path_cost(@$path) ."\n";
}


RECOMMENDED

Understanding the Graph's filosofy and how to trace it. 

Reach for graph's books , also Dijkstra's algorithm.

ABSTRACT

This example cover all possibilities to find the graph's paths from Node A to Node C and the cost for itself.

DESCRIPTION

This package provides an object class which can be used to get diferents graph paths , with only pure perl code and I don't use other packet or module cpan.

This class calculates the shortest path between two nodes in a graph and return in other method , vals in the execution time (free_path_event).

Technically , the graph is composed of vertices (nodes) and edges (with optional weights) linked between them.

The shortest path is found using the Dijkstra's algorithm. This algorithm is the fastest and requires all weights to be positive. 

The object builds a help about this concept of the graph's , exist a method named debug().

Three Case how to call Object and get a good performance as following:

CASE 1 $obj->shortest_path

	#!/usr/bin/perl

	my %graph = (
			A => {B=>1,C=>4,G=>2},
			B => {A=>1,C=>2,D=>1,E=>5,F=>9,G=>8},
			C => {A=>4,B=>2,F=>6},
			D => {B=>1,E=>7,G=>3},
			E => {B=>5,D=>7,F=>2},
			F => {B=>9,C=>6,E=>2},
			G => {A=>2,B=>8,D=>3}
	);

	use Paths::Graph;

	my $obj = Paths::Graph->new(-origin=>"A",-destiny=>"F",-graph=>\%graph);
	my @paths = $obj->shortest_path();
	for my $path (@paths) {
		print "Shortest Path:" . join ("->" , @$path) . " Cost:". $obj->get_path_cost(@$path) . "\n";
	}

CASE 2 $obj->free_path_event

	#!/usr/bin/perl

	my %graph = (
			A => {B=>1,C=>4,G=>2},
			B => {A=>1,C=>2,D=>1,E=>5,F=>9,G=>8},
			C => {A=>4,B=>2,F=>6},
			D => {B=>1,E=>7,G=>3},
			E => {B=>5,D=>7,F=>2},
			F => {B=>9,C=>6,E=>2},
			G => {A=>2,B=>8,D=>3},
	);

	use Paths::Graph;
	my $obj = Paths::Graph->new(-origin=>"A",-destiny=>"F",-graph=>\%graph,-sub=>\&get_paths);
	$obj->free_path_event();
	sub get_paths {
		my ($self , @nodes) = @_;
		print join("->",@nodes) . "\n";
	}

CASE 3 $obj->debug()

	#!/usr/bin/perl

	my %graph = (
			A => {B=>1,C=>4,G=>2},
			B => {A=>1,C=>2,D=>1,E=>5,F=>9,G=>8},
			C => {A=>4,B=>2,F=>6},
			D => {B=>1,E=>7,G=>3},
			E => {B=>5,D=>7,F=>2},
			F => {B=>9,C=>6,E=>2},
			G => {A=>2,B=>8,D=>3},
	);

	use Paths::Graph;
	my $obj = Paths::Graph->new(-origin=>"A",-destiny=>"F",-graph=>\%graph);
	$obj->debug();

PARAMETERS

$obj->{graph}

This object is the main element to resolve the trace graph problem.

The following cases are options of how this hash operate.

Note:It's not important the nodes's names  , it's only important the nodes's values. example.

	my %g = ( 
		Linux => {Perl=>10,Regex=>20}
		CPAN  => {Modules=>1,Opensource=>100} 
	);

CASE 1 Directed Graph

The directed graph are covered too.

	my %g = (
		A => {B=>10,C=>20,D=>1},
		C => {B=>25,G=>1}
	); 

Fixed D and G do not exist , but it's fine.

CASE 2 Jumper Graph

	my %g = (
		A => {B=>1,C=>1,D=>1},
		C => {B=>1,G=>1}
	); 

Fixed D and G do not exist , but it's fine.

or

	my %g = (
		A => {B=>1,C=>1},
		B => {B=>1,C=>1},
		C => {A=>1,B=>1}
	); 

CASE 3 Cost Graph 

	my %graph = (
			A => {B=>1,C=>4},
			B => {A=>1,C=>2},
			C => {A=>4,B=>2},
	); 

The cost from A->C=4 and C->A=4

my %graph = (
                A => {B=>1,C=>1},
                B => {A=>1,C=>2},
                C => {A=>4,B=>2},
); 

The cost from A->C=1 and C->A=4

If the cost is distinct , it's not a problem.

$obj->{origin} and $obj->{destiny}

It's not important the order on the hash graph. 

$obj->{origin} = "A";

$obj->{destiny} = "B";

or

$obj->{origin} = "A";

$obj->{destiny} = "A";

Is not a problem if the origin and destiny nodes are equals. In this case the graph is traced from A to A.

$obj->{sub}

This method returns the parameters from the object:

$self  = some object control.
@nodes = vals of arrays.

Note:The values's names do not have to be necesary equals , example;

	$obj->{sub} = \&my_method;

	sub my_method {

		my ($obj,@nodes)  = @_ ; # good

	}
  
The method described above assigned its values to the object (my_method).  

$obj->shortest_path()

This object's method find the shortest path and cost for the graph using the hash.  

$obj->free_paths_event() 

This method return a paths array during the execution time , it's generated a method to receive an array and the object with its methods and values.

$obj->get_path_cost();

This method returns the paths cost (nodes array). 

Trace graph hash recurcive.   

$obj->debug()

Educational procedure traces and shows the algorithm during execution time ($obj->debug). This method shows how the algorithm is being deploy background. 


DEBUGGING

Implementation of educational procedure of the object to call the debug() method;

GLOBAL PROCESSING

Using the recursive technique in the object methods.

EXPORT

These methods are exported as follow: shortest_path() free_path_event() debug()

SEE ALSO

None by default. But can be exported if it's required.

Please report bugs using: <cristian@codigolibre.cl>.

Powerfull features in the future.

HISTORY

Update in 2008 problem found by Keunwan Park problem produced in search where node value is equal to '0'

Thank , Keunwan Park will be contribute to perl comunity

Solucionate by me ;) , update available in version 0.03
