Apache::AxKit::Provider::File::Formatter version 0.96
=====================================================

This is an AxKit Provider that may be used to apply any module that
conforms with the Formatter API to a file. At the time of this
writing, there are three modules in the Formatter:: namespace, one for
formatting the Text::Textile syntax, one to use HTML::Tidy to clean up
existing HTML and one to add minimal HTML markup to a preformatted
plain text.

The Formatter API is a very simple API, designed to do simple
conversion between different syntaxes. The API Specification itself
can be found in the Formatter distribution on CPAN and has currently
version 0.93, but is expected to be rather stable. The author will
make a 1.0 release of the Provider once the Formatter API hits 1.0. It
is mostly used to make HTML from some simple text-based syntax, but it
can be used to convert anything.

This Provider will let you use any syntax that there is a Formatter
module for with minimum effort.

If you want to output HTML, and not XML for further processing, you
may configure AxKit to use the supplied transforms/xhtml2html.xsl
XSLT, see inline POD for an example. You may need to apply a
stylesheet even if you just want XML too, in that case, you may find
transforms/do-nothing.xsl handy.

INSTALLATION

To install this module use the CPAN or CPANPLUS tools, or type the
following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

This module only depends on AxKit, but you would need to have at least
one of the modules in the Formatter:: namespace to use this Provider
meaningfully. See CPAN for available Formatters.
