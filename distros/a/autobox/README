autobox version 2.85
====================

The autobox pragma allows methods to be called on integers, floats, strings, arrays, hashes, and code references in exactly the same manner as blessed references.

Autoboxing is transparent: values are not blessed into their (user-defined) implementation class (unless the method elects to bestow such a blessing) - they simply use its methods as though they are.

autobox is lexically scoped, and bindings for an outer scope can be overridden or countermanded in a nested scope.

See the POD for more details.
