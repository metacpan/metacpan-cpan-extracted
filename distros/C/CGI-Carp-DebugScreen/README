CGI-Carp-DebugScreen version
============================

CGI::Carp::DebugScreen provides decent debug/error screens for Web
applications via CGI::Carp's set_message() function. You don't need
to care $SIG{__DIE__} anymore. Just die or croak to get the right 
thing. You can customize those screens as well.
