Tie-StoredOrderHash version 0.22
================================

Tie::StoredOrderHash is a(nother) implementation of a Perl hash that
preserves the order in which elements are stored.

While uncooked Perl hashes make no guarantees about the order in which
elements are iterated, T::SOH objects iterate over elements in a
consistent order, starting with the least-recently-updated element,
and finishing with the element that was most-recently added or updated.

INSTALLATION

   perl Makefile.PL

DEPENDENCIES
