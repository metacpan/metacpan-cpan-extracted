 Sometimes when you write a perl script you have to call an external command.
 That's ok if it's a private script or if you know for sure it will run on a
 single architecture.

 But if want to distribute the script or you work on a multi-architecture
 environment you can't simply call to the external command and expect it
 will work just fine. That only happens in the movies.

 This module privides an OS independent interface to the Unix 'at' command
 and it will map the calls to real (and OS dependent) commands. It has been
 configured and tested for:

		Solaris 2.9
		HPUX 11.00
		Digital Unix 5.1
		Digital Unix 4.0
		Linux (RedHat 7.3)

 Not tested but it should work on:
		HPUX 10.20
		SunOs 4.1.4
		AIX
		Dynix/ptx
		FreeBSD
		OpenBSD
		Solaris 2.10
		Linux
		NetBSD
		DragonFly BSD
 
 You can configure a new OS very easily (read the end of the At.pm module),
 and the mechanism used could be used for configuring and adapting other
 OS dependent commands. Please, feel free to send e-mail to 
 "jose AT rodriguez.jp" to discuss this matter, configure Schedule::At for 
 more Operating Systems or report bugs.
