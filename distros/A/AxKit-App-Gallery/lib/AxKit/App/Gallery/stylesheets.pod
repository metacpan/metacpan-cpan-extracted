AxKit::App::Gallery::stylesheets

=head1 DESCRIPTION

AxKit::App::Gallery works by generating XML, and then passing the
generated XML through a collection of stylesheets.  The output of one
stylesheet is passed on as input to the next.  In this way, a pipeline of
stylesheets if formed.

Some of the stylesheets are written in XSLT, some are written in
XPathScript.  This manual page provides a brief description of the
stylesheets that are shipped with AxKit::App::Gallery, in the order in
which they are supposed to run.  For further details, see the comments in
the stylesheets.

=head1 STYLESHEETS FOR GENERATING THE PROOFSHEET

=over 4

=item AxHandleDirs

Not strictly a stylesheet.  The C<AxHandleDirs> directive in the
F<httpd.conf> file configures AxKit to generate XML containing a list of
the files and directories in a given directory.  

=item scrubfilelist.xps

The filelist is scrubbed to remove files and directories that should not 
be processed.  The rules are (note: check the code in case this has 
changed -- if it has, send in a bug report):

=over 4

=item *

Remove all directories that start with a C<.>, with the exception of the
current directory, C<.>.

=item *

Remove all files that start with a C<.>.

=item *

Remove all files that are not images -- i.e., their MIME type does not
start C<image/>.

=item *

Remove all files that are unreadable.

=back

=item sortfilelist.xsl

The file list may not be supported, with directories and files appearing
in any order.  The file list is sorted, with directories appearing first
in alphabetical order, followed by files, in alphabetical order.

=item filelist2proofsheet.xsl

The remainder of the stylesheets work on building and formatting a 
C<proofsheet> structure.  This stylesheet builds the basic proofsheet
structure, and does the initial population of the C<albums> and C<images>
elements.  See C<AxKit::App::Gallery::proofsheet> for complete details of
this format.

=item trimproofsheet.xps

::Gallery can be configured to display a maximum number of images per
proofsheet.  If there are too many images to display then the proofsheet
is divided in to pages, and the end user can navigate between the pages.

Given the current page number, this stylesheet removes all the images from 
the proofsheet that would not appear on the current page.

In the out-of-the-box configuration, this stylesheet is placed here
because some of the later stylesheets may be computationally expensive, so
on a slow box you want to trim the list down to the minimum number of
images that must be processed.  On a faster box this can be placed later
in the chain.  This would speed up the appearance of subsequent pages from
a large proofsheet.  I haven't benchmarked it, but this speed up is likely
to be negligible...

=item addconfig.xps

The XSLT stylesheets have no access to the gallery configuration variables
that are specified in the Apache config file.  Nor can they retrieve
information about the query (its URI, and so forth).  This XPathScript
stylesheet retrieves this information, and plugs it in to the <proofsheet>
structure so that subsequent XSLT stylesheets can use this information.

=item extractimageinfo.xps

Each image has meta-data associated with it.  Image dimensions, EXIF data,
and so on.  This stylesheet checks to see whether or not this data should
be extracted -- is the cached copy out of date? -- and if necessary 
extracts it and saves it in the correct cache directory to a file called
F<imageinfo.xml>.

=item mergeimageinfo.xsl

After the metadata has been extracted and cached, this stylesheet finds
the cached metadata and incorporates it in to the document.

=item proofsheet2html.xsl

Finally, once the complete proofsheet has been compiled, it's converted to
HTML.  This stylesheet is intended to serve as an example.  If you want to
change the look and feel of the gallery proofsheet pages then this is the
stylesheet to adjust.

=back

=head1 STYLESHEETS FOR GENERATING THE IMAGESHEET

=over 4

=item AxKit::App::Gallery::Provider

Not strictly a stylesheet.  The ::Provider is run whenever one of the
image files is requested, and AxKit::App::Gallery::Plugin returns OK
(indicating that AxKit should process the request, instead of letting
Apache serve the file).

The C<get_strref()> method generates the initial XML <imagesheet>
document.  See L<AxKit::App::Gallery::imagesheet> for complete
documentation about this document and its structure.

=item mergeimageinfo.xsl

See the earlier description of F<mergeimageinfo.xsl>.

=item imagesheet2html.xsl

Once the complete imagesheet has been compiled, it's converted to HTML.
This stylesheet is intended to server as an example.  If you want to
change the look and feel of the gallery imagesheet pages then this is the
stylesheet to adjust.

=item imagesheet2html.xsl
