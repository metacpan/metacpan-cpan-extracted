1.6006 2018-10-09

 * Update MANIFEST.SKIP.

 * Sync test files with Math-BigInt.

 * Better Makefile.PL.

1.6005 2018-04-17

 * Fix memory leak in _modinv() (thanks to DANAJ). See CPAN RT #123807.

 * Make tests pass when '.' is not in @INC. (CPAN RT #120718)

 * The tests now require Test::More version 0.88 or newer.

 * Sync test files with Math-BigInt.

 * Add test files t/release-test-version.t, t/release-portability.t, and
   t/release-cpan-changes.t.

 * Use a MANIFEST.SKIP file based on the default file in the ExtUtils-Manifest
   distribution.

 * Format CHANGES according to CPAN::Changes::Spec.

 * Convert test file t/02pod.t to t/release-pod.t and t/03podcov.t to
   t/release-pod-coverage.t.

1.6004 2017-02-05 pjacklam

 * Fix typos in POD.

 * Update link in SUPPORT section.

 * Minor improvements to the documentation (POD).

1.6003 2017-01-11 pjacklam

 * Fix syntax for required version of Math::BigInt::Lib.

 * Better checking of POD coverage.

 * Sync test files with Math-BigInt-1.999808.

1.6002 2016-12-03 pjacklam

 * Use ExtUtils::MakeMaker rather than Module::Install in Makefile.PL

 * Don't use Devel::CheckLib. It fails on Windows even in cases where
   this distribution would build just fine.

 * Update BUGS file.

 * Remove author information in LICENSE file.

 * Inform that the TODO file is not up to date.

 * Remove INSTALL file. The information is in the README file.

1.6001 2016-11-23 pjacklam

 * Sync test files with Math-BigInt-1.999801.

 * Correct version number in CHANGES file.

1.6000 2016-11-15 pjacklam

 * Sync test files with Math-BigInt-1.999800.

 * Update bundled Devel::CheckLib from v1.03 to v1.07.

 * Math::BigInt::GMP is now a subclass of Math::BigInt::Lib, so remove pure
   Perl methods from Math::BigInt::GMP that are implemented in the superclass
   Math::BigInt::Lib. The methods removed are _digit(), _num(), _nok(), and
   _log_int(). The version of _log_int() implemented in Math::BigInt::GMP was
   buggy anyway.

 * Fix _check() so it doesn't give a "use of uninitialized value" warning if
   given an undefined "object".

 * Trim whitespace in all files.

 * Better use of the functionality in Test::More in t/bigintg.t.

1.51 2016-04-25 pjacklam

 * Sync test files with Math-BigInt-1.999719.

1.50 2016-04-22 pjacklam

1.48 2015-12-31 pjacklam

 * Sync test files with Math-BigInt-1.999713.

1.47 2015-12-14 pjacklam

 * Add patch from Gregor Herrmann (GREGOA) based on code by Dana Jacobsen
   (DANAJ) to fix problems with the new() method when Perl is compiled with
   support for 64-bit integers, but on platforms when the underlying OS is
   32-bit (CPAN RT #71548).

1.46 2015-12-03 pjacklam

 * Add patch from Dana Jacobsen (DANAJ) and add new test file
   't/mbi-from-big-scalar.t' regarding CPAN RT #103517.

 * Fix spelling in GMP.xs ('modifing' -> 'modifying').

 * Whitespace/formatting in t/bigintg.t to make it more readble (for me, at
   least) and more in accordance with the 'perlstyle' manpage.

1.45 2015-11-09 pjacklam

 * Sync test files with Math-BigInt-1.999709.

 * Required version of Test::More is 0.47.

1.44 2015-10-29 pjacklam

 * Sync test files with Math-BigInt-1.999707.

 * Update the README file.

 * Remove the files INSTALL and LICENSE as this information is already covered
   in the file README.

 * Replace 'use vars ...' with 'our ...'. We require a Perl newer than 5.6.0
   anyway.

 * Required version of Math-BigInt is now 1.999706.

 * Add 'Test::More' to TEST_REQUIRES in Makefile.PL.

 * Enable 'use warnings'. We require a Perl newer than 5.6.0 anyway.

 * Add 'assertlib.*\.exe' to MANIFEST.SKIP, since make generates temporary
   files like 'assertlibzxjE4WfG.exe' on Cygwin.

1.43 2015-09-21 pjacklam

 * Sync test files with Math-BigInt-1.999703.

 CHANGES
 * Add changes for the newest release.
 * Reorder change entries into descending chronological order.

 lib/Devel/CheckLib.pm
 * Update bundled Devel::CheckLib from v1.01 to v1.03.

 Makefile.PL
 * Update required version of Math-BigInt to 1.9994.

 t/01load.t
 * Improve formatting of module version information.

 t/bigfltpm.t
 * Use the correct backend, in this case Math::BigInt::GMP.
 * Skip test specific for the Math::BigInt::Calc backend.

 t/bigintpm.inc
 * Rather than an early exit(), use skip() to skip tests.

 t/bigintpm.t
 * Use the correct backend, in this case Math::BigInt::GMP.

 t/biglog.t
 * Use the correct backend, in this case Math::BigInt::GMP. This was correct
   in v1.21, but has been wrong since then.

 t/bigroot.t
 * Use the correct backend, in this case Math::BigInt::GMP. This was correct
   up until v1.32, but has been wrong since then.

 lib/Math/BigInt/GMP.pm
 * Increment Math::BigInt::GMP version number to 1.40.

1.39 2015-08-17 pjacklam

 * Updated test files with those from Math-BigInt-1.9997.

1.38 2014-04-03 pjacklam

 * Updated test files from the Math::BigInt distribution (Peter John Acklam).

 * Updated POD (Peter John Acklam)

 * Updated bundled Devel::CheckLib from v0.93 to v1.01 (Peter John Acklam).

1.37 2011-09-04 pjacklam

 * Updated test files from the Math::BigInt distribution (Peter John Acklam).

 * Updated bundled Devel::CheckLib from v0.92 to v0.93 (Peter John Acklam).

 * Math::BigInt::GMP now requires Math::BigInt v1.997 (Peter John Acklam).

 * Include "^MYMETA\.(yml|json)\z" in MANIFEST.SKIP. Whereas META.* are
   generated by the distribution author at packaging time, MYMETA.* are
   generated by the end user at configure time after any dynamic dependencies
   are known. (Peter John Acklam)

 * Changed Makefile.PL so that a "make dist" makes a META.yml and META.json.
  (Peter John Acklam)

 * Updated common test files from the Math::BigInt distribution. (Peter John
   Acklam)

1.36 2011-02-26 pjacklam (6362 tests)

 * Change bigintpm.inc to reflect recent changes in the Math::BigInt
   distribution (Peter John Acklam).

 * Use a _nok() function more similar to the one in Math::BigInt::Calc
  (Peter John Acklam).

1.35 2011-02-08 pjacklam (6361 tests)

 * Rename files for testing signature, module loading, and POD so the names
   are within the 8+3 character limit (Peter John Acklam).

 * Rename method _nok_ok() to the correct _nok(). There ought to have been a
   test catching an error like that (Peter John Acklam).

 * Fix _nok() giving wrong output when second input argument is zero
  (Peter John Acklam).

 * Fix _nok() so it doesn't modify its second input arg (Peter John Acklam).

 * Update the included Devel::CheckLib to most recent version as suggested in
   RE #63055 (Peter John Acklam).

 * Apply "chmod 0644" to the few test scripts that don't already have that
   mode (Peter John Acklam).

1.34 2011-02-07 pjacklam (6361 tests)

 * Rename _num() to _str(). The old _num() did exactly what _str() is supposed
   to do, according to the API documentation (Peter John Acklam).

 * Add a _num() function which (currently) simply numifies the output from
   _str() (Peter John Acklam).

 * Clean up whitespace (Peter John Acklam).

 * Fix POD errors (Peter John Acklam).

 * Add _nok() method. Now the old claim that Math::BigInt::GMP conforms to API
   version 2 is actually true (Peter John Acklam).

 * Edit the test files that were copied from the Math::BigInt distribution, so
   we now test Math::BigInt against Math::BigInt::GMP, not Math::BigInt::Calc.
   I had forgotten this when I copied the test files from the Math::BigInt
   distribution. This reduces the total test count, since some test are not
   executed with Math::BigInt::GMP (Peter John Acklam).

 * Replace morse code in 'README' with proper text (Peter John Acklam).

 * Include '01-load.t' for explicitly testing module loading (Peter John
   Acklam).

 * Use more generic code in 'pod.t' and 'pod_cov.t' (Peter John Acklam).

1.33 2011-01-30 pjacklam (6411 tests)

 * Fix _modinv() so that it works the same way as _modinv() in other
   Math::BigInt libraries: The output arguments are an object and the
   corresponding sign, not undef (Peter John Acklam).

 * Include most recent versions of the test files from the Math-BigInt
   distribution (bigfltpm.inc, bigfltpm.t, bigintpm.inc, bigintpm.t,
   biglog.t, and bigroot.t) (Peter John Acklam).

 * Include generic SIGNATURE test file (Peter John Acklam).

 * Required version of Math::BigInt is now 1.99_05 (Peter John Acklam).

1.32 2010-09-23 rafl 5559 tests

 * Re-upload 1.31 as a stable release without further changes.

1.31 2010-09-21 rafl 5559 tests  DEVELOPMENT RELEASE

 * Add hooks for Storable (de-)serialisation.

 * Avoid failure in the destructor if someone blessed nonsense into our class.

1.30 2010-09-20 rafl 5558 tests

 * Re-upload 1.29 as a stable release without further changes.

1.29 2010-09-19 rafl 5558 tests  DEVELOPMENT RELEASE

 * Attempt to fix a bug in the bundled version Devel::CheckLib.
   It used to ignore @Config{qw(ccflags ldflags)} and only tried to look for
   headers and libraries with the compiler's default include- and lib-paths as
   well as those explicitly asked for by the user.

1.28 2010-09-17 rafl 5558 tests

 * Re-upload 1.27 without further changes as a stable release.

1.27 2010-09-15 rafl 5558 tests  DEVELOPMENT RELEASE

 * Try to support perls older than 5.8.8 again.
   Tested with 5.8.7 and 5.6.2.

1.26 2010-09-14 rafl 5558 tests  DEVELOPMENT RELEASE

 * Error out early if libgmp or gmp.h are missing.

 * Clone Math::BigInt::GMP instances on thread cloning.
   This should make the module threadsafe.

1.25 2010-09-10 rafl 5536 tests

 * Fix tests with Math::BigInt >= 1.90 and depend on it.

1.24 2007-07-31 Tels 5530 tests

 * apply patch for warnings about ptr size mismatch under Cygwin (thanx
   Reini Urban!)

 * make it work under 5.6.x again by defining SvUOK() (Thanx Marcus
   Holland-Moritz and Reini Urban!)

1.23 2007-07-25 Tels 5527 tests

 * require Math::BigInt 1.87

 * fix for _new() (appeared under Cygwin, but possible others, thanx
   Linda W. (report) and Reini Urban (patch)!)

1.22 2007-06-01 Tels 5527 tests

 * require Math::BigInt 1.86

 * support api_version() 2 by adding _nok()

 * fix compilation issues on Mac/Darwin

 * _log_int() modifies it's argument instead of just returning a
   different object as result

 * speed up _log_int() greatly by taking a guess of the result
   and then improve it, instead of startig with 1 and going up. This means
   it takes now a more or less constant time, instead of a time proportional
   to the size/value of the result:

1.21 2007-04-17 Tels 5488 tests

 * add _as_oct(), _from_oct(), _alen(), _1ex() and some _root() tests

 * require Math::BigInt 1.83

 * support api_version() by adding _1ex() and _alen()

 * _new(): take a shortcut if the passed an IV (integer value)

1.20 2007-04-09 Tels 5351 tests

 * remove PREREQ_FATAL because the toolchain is broken and cannot handle it

 * take over tests from MBI 1.82 and require it

 * require Perl 5.6.2 as minimum

 * speed up _zeros():
   + use Newx() instead of a full-blown SV for temp storage
   + no need to allocate temp storage for numbers < 10

 * put _len() into XS code, making $x->length() faster (about 30% for "123",
   less for longer numbers as the binary=>decimal conversion dominates)

 * add POD tests

 * add MANIFEST.SKIP

1.19 2007-01-27 Tels 5339 tests

 * add support for octal

 * take over tests from MBI 1.78 and require it

1.18 2005-04-11 Tels 5186 tests

 * _log_int() handles now plain scalars as $base parameter

 * take over tests from MBI 1.76, require it

1.17 2005-01-01 Tels 5182 tests

 * use XSLoader instead of DynaLoader to save a tiny amount of memory

 * take over tests from Math::BigInt v1.74

 * require Math::BigInt v1.74

 * simplify sub code in XS (left-over artifact from v1.16)

 * fix a leak in _zeros()

 * _zeros() is now much faster for odd numbers (O(1) vs. O(N*N))

1.16 2004-12-09 Tels 5112 tests

 * fixed a leak in _div() (Thanx Tassilo v. Parsival!)

 * put _div() into XS, making division slightly faster for small numbers

 * put leak.pl and leaktest into MANIFEST for later checking

1.15 2004-11-22 Tels 5112 tests

 * some small cleanups in the Perl code

 * changed "class" to "Class" to avoid the reserved keyword for MS compiler

 * do not pull unused parameter "Class" from stack - avoid compiler warnings

 * put _sub() into XS for more speed and smaller memory footprint

 * testsuite from MBI v1.73

1.14 2004-02-15 Tels 4867 tests

 * require BigInt v1.70, use tests from it and make API compatible with it

 * _rsft() and _lsft() modify their argument instead of making a copy,
   meaning brsft() and blsft() got about 20% faster in BigInt

 * added a working _zeros() method

 * added a working _log_int() method

1.13 2004-01-10 Tels 4759 tests

 * tests from BigInt v1.68

 * removed DESTROY from GMP.pm and made GMP.xs destroy => DESTROY

 * removed _num from GMP.pm and made GMP.xs __stringify => _num

 * removed _modinv() from GMP.pm and fixed up _modinv in GMP.xs

 * disabled the borken _log_int() from the XS code

 * modify $x in place for _dec, _inc, _add, _mod, _mul, _fac, _and, _or,
   _xor, _sqrt, _root and _sub (sub in non-reversed form), this removes some
   malloc/free and makes these ops slightly faster
   (between 10 and 33% in Math::BigInt (!), depending on input and size)

1.12 2003-12-11 Tels 4677 tests

 * testsuite from v1.67, especialy revamped bigintg.t

 * fixed prereq to require BigInt v1.67

 * added _log_int() to XS code

 * some routines did only return the result, but not modify $x in place

 * testsuite from v1.65

 * fixed prereq to require BigInt v1.65

 * removed unused function _mmod from XS code

 * removed unnecc. if len == 0 check in _as_bin(), _as_hex() etc

 * replace some RETVAL = malloc() lines with defined to make changing them
   later much easier

1.11 2003-01-01 Tels 4109 tests

 * rewrote stringify_bin() and stringify_hex() to not allocate scratch buffers
   Faster, no longer needs malloc()/free() and strlen().
   Thanx to Sysiphus for pointing this out.

 * removed _as_hex() and _as_bin() from GMP.pm and moved the logic to GMP.xs

 * documented in todo to replace all malloc()/free() with New and Safefree()

 * removed unused cmp_two() function in GMP.xs

 * removed the unused "$zero = ..."/"$one = ..." in GMP.pm

1.10 2002-12-24 Tels 4109 tests

 * Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year to all!

 * cut out more dead wood from GMP.xs, GMP.so file shrunk a bit

 * added some comments in GMP.xs

 * fixed PREREQ to BigInt v1.64 since v1.65 is not yet out *sigh*

 * more functions like _is_odd()/_is_even()/_acmp() directly in XS - cut away
   perl layer subroutines for more speed (about 10-30% more ops/s for small
   argument or constant cases or other cases where the overhead is greater
   than the actual math operation itself)

 * __stringify() no longer malloc()s a temp. storage => faster

 * added _root(), _lsft() and_rsft() functions for great speedups

 * Running the benchmark script above (adopted a bit) on the same 1 Ghz AMD
   under BigInt v1.64:
   Benchmark: running div_l, mod_l, mod_s for at least 3 CPU seconds...
    div_l:  3s ( 3.20 usr +  0.00 sys =  3.20 CPU) @ 4655.00/s (n=14896)
    mod_l:  4s ( 3.31 usr +  0.00 sys =  3.31 CPU) @ 6851.96/s (n=22680)
    mod_s:  3s ( 3.01 usr +  0.00 sys =  3.01 CPU) @ 7088.37/s (n=21336)

 * Full (memory and other) benchmarks at http://bloodgate.com/perl/bigint/

 * no longer needs Math::GMP (and Carp), but uses own XS layer

 * is thus faster (saves one perl subroutine layer) and less memory hungry
   (it now uses even less memory than using Calc!)
   new XS lets us cut out a subroutine layer

 * new XS will enable us to implement *all* missing functions like _root(),
   _as_hex(), _as_bin() and _rsft(), _lsft()

 * fixed PREREQ to BigInt v1.65

 * extended tests in bigintg.t to cover more functions

1.08 2002-12-12 Tels 4069 tests (never released)

 * added implementation of bmodpow() using GMPs mpow_gmp()

 * release signed by key http://bloodgate.com/tels.asc id 93B84C15

 * added _from_bin()

1.05 2002-02-16 Tels

 * tests from Math::BigInt v1.51

 * replaced _core_lib() by config()->{lib}

 * added _and, _or, _xor (using Math::GMP internal methods)

 * switched _fac over to use Math::GMP gmp_fac()

 * added _sqrt() using gmp_sqrt()

 * used div_two and bdiv_two for _div()

 * tests for _div() in list context and _mod

 * added _from_hex()

 The speedups in band(), bxor(), bior() and bfac() are at least factor 10 for
 small numbers and quickly raise as the numbers grow ;)
 The speedup for bmod() and bdiv() aren't that dramatic, but still worth it.

1.04 2002-01-26 Tels

 * use $zero,$one,$two etc instead of 0,1,2 in some routines

 * tests from Math::BigInt v1.50

 * bypass Math::GMP's overload interface and use Math::GMP::gmp_foo() directly

 * added _gcd() and _fac() for more speed in bgcd() and bfac(), respectively

 * _is_odd()/_is_even() use $two instead of 2: 5600 op/s instead of 4700
