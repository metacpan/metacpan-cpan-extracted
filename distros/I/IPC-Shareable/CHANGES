0.50 Tue Mar 21 11:56:32 EST 2000
        - Complete rewrite incorporating the following changes.
        - Requires 5.00503.  This allowed the module to get rid of the
          global cache for shared memory segments; each Shareable
          object now carries around its own data.
        - 5.00503 also allowed tied arrays to be implemented
        - Shared memory segments can no longer be of infinite length
          thereby reducing the amount of code in the module by a
          factor of 2.
        - Uses IPC::Shareable::SharedMem class for accessing
          shared memory.
        - Uses IPC::Semaphore module for accessing semaphores.
        - Completely revisited the way references are dealed with: all
          referenced thingies are now automagically tied to shared
          memory.
        - Constants now imported from IPC::SysV; Shareable.xs is gone
        - Rewrote test suite and moved into t subdirectory
        - Updated man page

0.51  Fri May  5 23:47:06 EDT 2000
        - Fixed bug that would cause IPC::Shareable::BUF_SIZ to be
          ignored; thanks to Robert Emmery <roberte@netscape.com> and
          Mohammed J. Kabir <kabir@intevo.com> for reporting.
        - Stopped tests from leaking shm segments
        - Added test of argument parsing
        - doc fixes

0.52  Thu Sep 14 12:30:17 EDT 2000
        - Now STORE, PUSH, POP, etc all call _thaw() before doing
          their business.
        - Refined SIGALRM handlers in test scripts
        - Fixed concurrency issues affecting tied arrays and hashes;
          thanks to thanks to Robert Emmery <roberte@netscape.com>,
          Terry Ewing <terry@intevo.com>, Tim Fries
          <timf@dicecorp.com>, and Joe Thomas <jthomas@women.com>.
        - Doc fixes thanks to Paul Makepeace
          <Paul.Makepeace@realprogrammers.com>

0.53  Tue Nov 14 00:33:35 EST 2000
        - Fixed race condition in test suite causing intermitent
          failures.
        - Better checking for success of calls to Storable::thaw();
          thanks to Raphael Manfredi <Raphael_Manfredi@pobox.com>.

0.54  Mon Jan  8 11:52:28 EST 2001
        - Fix to allow IPC::Shareable to work with 1.0.* versions of
          Storable

0.60  Mon Mar  5 15:20:18 EST 2001
        - Lee Lindley (lee.lindley@bigfoot.com) added the _was_changed
          optimization, improved the locking functionality, fixed
          numerous bugs, and generally cleaned things up; thanks.
        - Removed support for "no" as a false value in arguments;
          thanks to Dave Rolsky <autarch@urth.org>

0.61  Mon Oct  8 00:27:39 2012
        - Added patch from Frank Lichtenheld fixing IPC::Shareable's dependence
          on the presence of a perl bug which is no longer present in perl >= 5.10
        - Fixed bug reported by Dan Harbin where the FETCH operation on a tie()d
          string containing HASH, ARRAY, or SCALAR fails because it was using
          the stringification of the data to determine what kind of reference
          it was.  Now using Scalar::Util::reftype
        - Added missing dependency on IPC::Semaphore to Makefile.PL (reported
          by Adrian Issott)
        - Added a 'sleep 1' in a test that was hanging on certain systems
          due (possibly) to two alarm signals coming too quickly to the
          child process.  From Ton Voon.
