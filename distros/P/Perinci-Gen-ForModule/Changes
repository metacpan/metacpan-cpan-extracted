0.05    2015-01-11 (PERLANCAR)

	- No functional changes.

        - Avoid perl undef warning, as well as switch from using
          Scalar::Util::reftype() to ref() as I don't have a need to use
          reftype().


0.04    2014-12-05 (PERLANCAR)

	- No functional changes.

	- Use the new renamed module SHARYANTO::Package::Util ->
	  Package::MoreUtil.

	- Remove 'promotional' 'This module uses {Log::Any,Rinci,Moo}
	  module' messages, because Log::Any and Moo are now very popular
	  already, and this message is redundant anyway (one can see deps
	  in MetaCPAN etc).
