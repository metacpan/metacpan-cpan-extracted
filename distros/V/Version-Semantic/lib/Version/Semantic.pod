=head1 NAME

Version::Semantic - Tiny SemVer based class implementation

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Version::Semantic ();

  my $v_unstable = Version::Semantic->parse( '1.0.0-alpha' );
  my $v_testing  = Version::Semantic->parse( '1.0.0-beta' );
  my $v_stable   = Version::Semantic->parse( 'v1.0.0' );

  if ( $v_unstable < $v_testing and $v_testing < $v_stable ) {
    ...
  }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class defines immutable version objects that support the L<Semantic
Versioning Specification (SemVer)|https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html>.

The class has a C<parse( $version )> factory method (a class method)
to create objects from their semantic version strings. The method accepts
semantic version strings that have a C<v> prefix (L<Is "v1.2.3" a semantic
version?|https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html#is-v123-a-semantic-version>).

Each object has the mandatory attributes C<major>, C<minor>,
and C<patch>.  Optional object attributes are C<pre_release> and
C<build>. C<has_pre_release()> and C<has_build_()> predicate methods exist too.

The C<version_core()> object method returns the semantic version string of an
object with the C<v> prefix (if originally set) but without the pre-release
and the build extensions.

The C<to_string()> object method returns the semantic version string of an
object including the C<v> prefix (if originally set). The method is used to
overload the stringification C<""> operator.

The C<compare_to()> object method implements the L<SemVer precedence
rules|https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html#spec-item-11>. This method is used
to overload the numeric comparison C<E<lt>=E<gt>> operator. This allows you
to compare version objects.
