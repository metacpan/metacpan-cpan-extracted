0.10    2016-09-10 (PERLANCAR)

	- [Bugfix] Workaround the problem of backtracking in the case of
	  attribute selector [foo() eq 1] or [foo.bar.baz() ne 2] (a
	  combination of paren in the last attribute name and an
	  alphanumeric operator) messing up the result.

0.09    2016-09-01 (PERLANCAR)

0.08    2016-05-31 (PERLANCAR)

0.07    2016-04-03 (PERLANCAR)

	- [Experimental] Allow chained attribute in attribute selector,
	  e.g. [date.month = 12].


0.06    2016-04-02 (PERLANCAR)

	- [Bugfix] Bump prereq version Code::Includable::Tree::NodeMethods
	  to 0.09 where ancestors() starts to appear.

	- [Bugfix] Parser fix: regex literal was too eager.


0.05    2016-04-01 (PERLANCAR)

	- [Optimization] Make :has and :not more efficient/less stupid.

	- Introduce option: class_prefixes.

	- csel(): Die on expression parse error.

	- POD formatting, L<blah|/Section> links are not always properly
	  rendered in metacpan.org.


0.03    2016-03-23 (PERLANCAR)

	- [ux] Word string value in attribute selector, and selector
	  argument for pseudo-classes :has & :not can be unquoted, for
	  convenience (like in CSS selector).


0.02     2016-03-22 (PERLANCAR)

         This release improves "compatibility" with CSS selector.

         - [Incompatible change] Type selector no longer uses isa() but string
           comparison of class name. This means the expression 'T' only matches
           objects of class T and not subclasses of T. To match subclasses, use
           the newly implemented class selector.

         - Implement class (.CLASS) and ID selector (#ID).

         - Type or universal selector is optional if there is at least one
           attribute/class/ID selector or pseudo-classes, like in CSS selector
           syntax.

         - Allow <> inequality operator in addition to !=.

         - Add pseudo-classes: :root & :empty.

         - [Internal] Reuse methods from Class::Includable::Tree::NodeMethods to
           avoid code duplication.


0.01     2016-03-20 (PERLANCAR)

         - First release.
