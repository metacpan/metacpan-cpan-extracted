Revision history for Perl module Perl::MinimumVersion

1.40 2021-04-21
    - No changes from 1.39

1.39 2021-04-11 (TRIAL RELEASE)
    - Features enabled via the 'experimental' pragma are now recognized (GH#5)
    - Depend on PPIx::Utils instead of Perl::Critic::Utils (GH#6)
    - Recognize several new features and their minimum required Perl versions (GH#10, GH#20)
      - 'say', 'smartmatch', 'postderef', 'postderef_qq', 'signatures',
        'refaliasing', 'bitwise', 'declared_refs', 'isa', 'indirect'

1.38 2014-08-22
    - The doc for Perl::MinimumVersion now mentions perlver in both
      the DESCRIPTION and SEE ALSO sections. RT#98262 from pagenyon++.
    - Added mention of Perl::MinimumVersion::Fast to SEE ALSO.

1.37 2014-05-11
    - Removed the check for "stacked labels" that I added in 1.36, as it appears
      that I misinterpreted what the 5.14 change was, and broke at least one dist.
      Commented out the check in MinimumVersion.pm, and the specific subtests.
      Apologies to HMBRAND and all others affected
    - The way I was comparing versions in one of the new tests in 1.36 wasn't portable
      across old versions of Perl. Thanks to Paul Howarth for RT#95528.

1.36 2014-05-09
    - CHECK block requires 5.6.2
    - UNITCHECK block requires 5.10.0
    - Stacked labels on the same statement requires 5.14.0

1.35 2014-05-02
    - 'state' requires perl 5.10.0, even if you don't also see
      "use feature 'state'", because you can also write "use 5.010" to
      enable 'state'. RT#67626
    - Dropped the rule that said "use base 'Exporter'" should make a
      dependency on Perl 5.008+ RT#89173
    - Improved the fix for RT#95023. Thanks again to Paul Howarth.

1.34 2014-04-24
    - The perlver script wasn't getting installed, because it's in
      a script/ directory. RT#95023, fix from ETHER.
    - t/02_main.t was failing on older versions of perl, because
      a min version is getting reported as '5.01301' on Perl 5.010 and later,
      but as '5.013010' on earlier Perls. RT#95023. I need to understand this
      better, but want to get a passing release out.
