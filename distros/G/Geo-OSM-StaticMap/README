NAME
    Geo::OSM::StaticMap - Generate URLs to Open Street Map static maps

VERSION
    version 0.4

SYNOPSIS
        my $staticmap = Geo::OSM::StaticMap->new(
            center  => [ 48.213950, 16.336290 ], # lat, lon
            zoom    => 17,
            size    => [ 756, 476 ], # width, height
            markers => [ [ 48.213950, 16.336290, 'red-pushpin' ] ], # lat, lon, marker
            maptype => 'mapnik',
        );

        my $url = $staticmap->url();

        # Alternatively let center and zoom be calculated from markers
        my $staticmap_url = Geo::OSM::StaticMap->new(
            size    => [ 756, 476 ], # width, height
            markers => [ [ 51.8785011494, -0.3767887732, 'ol-marker' ],
                         [ 51.455313, -2.591902, 'ol-marker' ], ],
                         # lat, lon, marker
        )->url();

DESCRIPTION
    Generate URLs for Open Street Map static maps. This is basically a
    simple wrapper for staticMapLite <http://staticmap.openstreetmap.de/>

    Map center and zoom level will be (not very exactly) calculated from the
    coordinates of markers given if center and zoom parameters are ommited.

    If no markers are given, the center parameter will default to 0 lat, 0
    lon which very likely will not be what you need.

    Consult <http://staticmap.openstreetmap.de/> for a list of valid values
    for markers and maptype.

METHODS
  url
    Returns URL string to fetch actual static map image via HTTP(S). All
    parameters can also be passed to the constructor.

   Parameters
    baseurl
        Baseurl of the static map service. Defaults to
        <http://staticmap.openstreetmap.de/>

    markers
        Array reference of array references of latitude and longitude pairs
        with a marker specifier.

        E.g. [ [ 51.8785011494, -0.3767887732, 'ol-marker' ], [ 51.455313,
        -2.591902, 'ol-marker' ], ]

        See <http://staticmap.openstreetmap.de/> for a list of valid values
        for markers.

    size
        Mapsize string. Width and height separated by 'x'

    maptype
        See <http://staticmap.openstreetmap.de/> for a list of valid values.
        Defaults to 'mapnik'

    center
        Array reference to latitude and longitude pair. Will be calculated
        automatically of ommited and markers have been given.

    zoom
        OSM zoom level. Will be calculated automatically of ommited and
        markers have been given.

Private methods
  _build_center
    Builder for the center of the map. Defaults to [0,0] which is not useful
    in most cases.

    Center will be calculated along the markers' bounding box if markers
    have been given.

  _build_zoom
    Builder for the OSM zoom level. Defaults to 17. If no center and no zoom
    parameters but markers have been supplied, zoom level will be calculated
    along the markers' bounding box

  _midpoint_to
     $self->midpoint_to( { lat => $lat1, lon => $lon1 }, { lat => $lat2, lon => $lon2 } );

    Returns the midpoint along a great circle path between the two points.

    This function is more or less a copy of Geo::Calc::midpoint_to but
    without the baggage the module dependencies of Geo::Calc are bringing
    in.
