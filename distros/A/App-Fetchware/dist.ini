; List of non-core (as of 5.10.01) prereqs.

;;;BUGALERT;;; Sometimes modules are removed from Perl's included library, so
;perhaps I should just list all used modules regardless of core or not?
[Prereqs]
; Perl 5.10.1 is the minimum version of Perl Fetchware supports. Originally this
; was because given/when was cool, and I wanted to use it, but given/when was
; brutally murdured in 5.16, because smart matching is not very smart, because
; you always have to lookup what it does in the documentation every time you use
; it. I could probably port Fetchware to 5.8 or even 5.6 if I wanted to, but I
; also use the cool // operator an say occastionally too.
