# ABSTRACT: Add encoding support to Poet/Mason apps

use Moose;
use Poet qw($poet $conf);
use Mason 2.13 ();

with 'Mason::Plugin';


#    So in short:
#    If someone is able write an UTF8 __PLUGIN__ for Mason2, need to do 5 things:
#
#    1.) add "use utf8;" into every obj. file (this should be done by
#            plugin regardless of the next)
#    2.) allow adding additional pradmas into the obj source - this is done already!
#    3.) encode everything what going from Mason ---to---> Plack
#    4.) decode everything what coming from Pack --to--> Mason
#    5.) Add UTF8 safe FillInForm into Filters (and check other filters)


# This sidesteps Poet::Plack::Request, but - at the moment (Jan 2016) - that's
# just an empty subclass of Plack::Request

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    In your Poet config file:

        # This is important or the first (and *only* the first) request will
        # not use Plack::Request::WithEncoding
        server.load_modules:
            - Mason::Plugin::WithEncoding

        mason:
          extra_plugins:
            - WithEncoding

        server.encoding.request: UTF-8
        server.encoding.response: UTF-8
        server.default_content_type: text/html; charset=UTF-8


=head1 DESCRIPTION

To decode the request, the plugin loads L<Plack::Request::WithEncoding> and
configures it with the encoding specified in C<server.encoding.request>. If no
such setting is found, the request is not decoded. This matches the default
behaviour of Poet/Mason, but is different from L<Plack::Request::WithEncoding>,
(which would normally default to UTF-8).

Output generated by your Mason templates is encoded according to the setting
in C<server.encoding.response>. If no such setting is found, the response is not
encoded. This is the default behaviour of Poet/Mason.

The content-type default header is set according to C<server.default_content_type>.
If no such setting is found, the default header is C<text/html>, as in the default
Poet/Mason setup. This tells the client what encoding to use when decoding our
content, and also (AFAIK) tells the client what encoding to use when sending us
data.

Output sent through C<send_json> is also encoded and the content-type header
set accordingly.

=head2 Caveat

This plugin only works inside a L<Poet> environment.
