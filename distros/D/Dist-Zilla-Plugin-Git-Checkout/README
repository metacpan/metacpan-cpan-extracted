NAME

    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Git::Checkout - clone and checkout a Git
    repository

VERSION

    Version 0.002

SYNOPSIS

      # in dist.ini:
      [Git::Checkout]
      repo = https://github.com/skirmess/dzil-inc.git

DESCRIPTION

    This plugin clones, or if it is already cloned, fetches and updates a
    Git repository.

    The plugin runs during the initialization phase, which is the same for
    bundles and plugins. You can check out a Git repository and load
    bundles or plugins from this repository.

      # in dist.ini
      [Git::Checkout]
      repo = https://github.com/skirmess/dzil-inc.git

      ; add the lib directory inside the checked out Git repository to @INC
      [lib]
      lib = dzil-inc/lib

      ; this bundle is run from inside the checked out Git repositories lib
      ; directory
      [@BundleFromRepository]

USAGE

 checkout

    Specifies what to check out. This can be a branch, a tag or a revision.
    Defaults to master.

 dir

    The repositories workspace is checked out into this directory. This
    defaults to the basename of the repo without the .git suffix.

 push_url

    Allows you to specify a different push url for the repositories origin.
    One possible scenario would be if you would like to clone via http but
    push via ssh. This is optional.

 repo

    Specifies the address of the repository to clone. This is required.
