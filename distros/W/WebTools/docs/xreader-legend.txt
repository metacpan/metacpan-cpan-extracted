<Nincremental_numberdata_come_from_file?name_of_file>
<N11file>  Begin of new part, where first "1" is a serial number, and second one show
                 whether data must be fetch from this file or from another!
                 If "0" then "file" must be a file name!
<>            End of part
<VAR>          Define one variable. That will be substituted with scalar incoming from
                 function parameter line.
<SL:number_of_query:"SQL_query":N_of_query:N_of_row:N_of_col:is_result_avalable?:SL>
<SL:1:"query":1:1:1:1:SL>
                 That execute one DB "query". That line has a number (first "1"). 
                 Second "1" is a line number from where xreader must read data.
                 If first "1" is not equal to "1" that mean that data will be
                 fetch from another query!
                 Thirth "1" is a number of row from where xreader will fetch data!
                 Next "1" is a column number, and last "1" is a bool. i.e
                 if "1" that mean that results will be returned into part! 
                 If it is "0", no result will be returned (but columns will be
                 saved into hash, for later use!)
<SLVAR:1:SL>   That is SQL variables. First "1" is a number of variable! (ID)


EXAMPLE:
--------

Evry data out of part is a comments!
<N11>
Your name is: <SL:1:"select USER,ID from demo_users where id=1;":1:1:1:1:SL>!<BR>
<SLVAR:1:SL>`s ID is: <SL:2:"":1:1:2:1:SL>!<BR>
<>

If you call xreader to process that file you will get follow example output:

Your name is: July
July's ID is 1

Explain: 
  First SQL query will fetch USER and ID fields from database and that information
will be shown in place of the SQL template. SQL variable will be substituted with result of
the previous query output. And second SQL query will never query DB again till ID is selected
from previous sql query.(SQL "2" fetch result from SQL "1")
