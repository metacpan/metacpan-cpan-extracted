NAME

    URI::Find::UTF8 - Finds URI from arbitrary text containing UTF8 raw
    characters in its path

SYNOPSIS

      use utf8;
      use URI::Find::UTF8;
    
      # Since this code has "use utf8", $text is UTF-8 flagged
      my $text = <<TEXT;
      Japanese Wikipedia home page is http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/メインページ
      TEXT
    
      my $finder = URI::Find::UTF8->new(\&callback);
      $finder->find(\$text);
    
      sub callback {
          my($uri, $orig) = @_;
    
          # $uri is an URI object that represents
          #   "http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%83%A1%E3%82%A4%E3%83%B3%E3%83%9A%E3%83%BC%E3%82%B8"
          # $orig is a string
          #   "http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/メインページ"
      }

DESCRIPTION

    URI::Find::UTF8 is an URI::Find extension to find URIs from arbitrary
    chunk of text that has UTF8 raw characters in its path (instead of URI
    escaped %XX%XX%XX form).

    This often happens when Safari users paste an URL to IM or IRC window,
    because Safari displays decoded URL path in its location bar, such as:

      http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/メインページ

    This module tries to extract URLs like this (in addition to normal URLs
    that URI::Find can find) and give you an encoded URL (URI object) and
    the raw, unencoded string.

    This module passes URI::Find's own test file (besides the old find_uris
    call), so this can be used as a drop-in replacement for the module.

    Note that this module doesn't (yet) handle International Domain Names.
