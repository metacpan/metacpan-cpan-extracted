    * Muldis Rosetta version 0.16.0 for Perl 5 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-Rosetta-0.16.0.tar.gz.  Muldis Rosetta version 0.16.0 for Perl 6
    is not released at all.  The rest of this Changes entry refers only to
    the Perl 5 version, and it should not be assumed that the Perl 6
    version incorporates all of said updates, though it may have some of
    them.

    * Oops, the previous release 0.15.0 shipped with code all declared as
    version 0.014000 rather than 0.015000; the metadata was correct though.

    * Updated external dependencies: Try::Tiny to version 0.04, Moose/etc
    to version 0.98, MooseX::Singleton to version 0.22, Class::MOP to
    version 0.98.

    * (Example.pm)  Corresponding to changes introduced in the
    documentation of MooseX::Singleton v0.22:  Updated the new_machine()
    subroutine of the "::Example" module to invoke the "::Machine" class'
    constructor submethod under the name "instance()" rather than "new()",
    because MXS now encourages the use of "instance" over "new", and the
    latter may be deprecated in a future MXS release.

    * (Interface.pm, Example.pm, Validator.pm, SeeAlso.pod)  In
    Interface.pm, updated the Muldis Rosetta public API so that the
    "::Machine"-constructor subroutine which the root module of a Muldis
    Rosetta Engine must provide is now named "select_machine" rather than
    "new_machine", because the new name is more descriptive as to what it
    actually does, being that each "::Machine"-doing class is a singleton.
    In Example.pm, made that change in its "::Example" module.  In
    Validator.pm and SeeAlso.pod, updated any refs to renamed sub's old
    name to use the new name.

    * (Interface.pm, Example.pm, Validator.pm)  Corresponding to changes
    introduced in Muldis D spec v0.96.0:  Updated all 4-element Muldis D
    language names to add the once-again-mandatory 5th (ln_extensions)
    element.  In some documentation, the details of that element are left
    as "...", but in all code or code examples it specifies just the
    mandatory "catalog_abstraction_level" pragma with "rtn_inv_alt_syn".

    * (Interface.pm)  Corresponding to changes introduced in Muldis D spec
    v0.88.0 and v0.108.0:  Update the description of the "trans_nest_level"
    method to omit mentions of "direct boot_stmt transaction management", a
    concept that no longer exists, and also to omit mentions of
    transactions in Muldis D sometimes being tied to "a try/catch context",
    also a concept that no longer exists; now, the *only* way to have a
    transaction start or end in Muldis D code is to for that transaction to
    be attached to the lexical scope of a Muldis D routine, so all
    invocations of that routine are main/nested transactions.

    * (Interface.pm, Validator.pm)  Corresponding to changes introduced in
    Muldis D spec v0.110.0:  Updated all Muldis D language names having a
    ln_extensions element so it specifies the new mandatory
    "op_char_repertoire" pragma with "extended".

    * (SeeAlso.pod)  Other minor updates.

    * Incremented all copyright year range-ends to 2010.

2009-11-09   Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Muldis Rosetta version 0.15.0 for Perl 5 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-Rosetta-0.15.0.tar.gz.  Muldis Rosetta version 0.15.0 for Perl 6
    is not released at all.  The rest of this Changes entry refers only to
    the Perl 5 version, and it should not be assumed that the Perl 6
    version incorporates all of said updates, though it may have some of
    them.

    * Updated the README file to indicate that this distribution now has 2
    public Git repositories, one on GitHub.com and one on utsl.gen.nz.

    * As of this release, Muldis Rosetta for Perl 5 uses Try::Tiny for
    cleaner and less error-prone exception handling versus plain 'eval';
    this distribution has now gained an external dependency on the Perl 5
    module 'Try::Tiny', which is not bundled with any version of Perl and
    will need to be installed from CPAN; Try::Tiny has no dependencies of
    its own besides Perl itself.

    * Updated external dependencies: namespace::autoclean to version 0.09,
    Moose/etc to version 0.92, MooseX::Singleton to version 0.21,
    Class::MOP to version 0.94.

    * This release features a significant update to the public API paradigm
    used by the Muldis Rosetta framework.  There are no longer any wrappers
    at all provided by the "Interface", and so users of a Muldis Rosetta
    "Engine" now interact with it directly in every respect; the initial
    work of loading an Engine and invoking its "new_machine" is no longer
    wrapped by an "Interface" routine, and users now do that directly.
    Note that all of the relevant changes were to Interface.pm and
    Validator.pm; Engine/Example.pm had zero related changes.

    * (Interface.pm)  Demoted "Muldis::Rosetta::Interface" from a "module"
    to a "package" and removed its "new_machine" subroutine; so now the
    only thing this package does is declare a module version number to
    apply to all the other packages in the file.  As a side-effect of this
    change, all of this distribution's direct usages of either the "Carp"
    or "Scalar::Util" modules have been eliminated.  Also renamed the main
    pod section "The Muldis::Rosetta::Interface Module" to "The Root
    Package of a Muldis Rosetta Engine" and rewrote its content; the
    signature of the "new_machine" constructor function was also updated to
    remove the "engine_name" parameter, as it now reflects the API that an
    Engine root package must have, rather than the now-removed Interface
    sub.  Also updated the "SYNOPSIS" main pod section as appropriate, to
    illustrate direct interaction with an Engine for loading etc.

    * (Validator.pm)  Partially rewrote the "main" subroutine to add
    adaptions of much of the code that was deleted from Interface.pm in the
    previous change item.  So "main" now tests individual stages of loading
    an Engine module and checking that it seems to be correct: that the
    module file exists and compiles, that it declares a package of the same
    name as the module, that it declares a "new_machine" subroutine.  Now
    "main" explicitly traps any errors that might occur prior to trying to
    invoke "new_machine" and will "BAIL_OUT" cleanly; only when trying to
    invoke an Engine that passed the prior-mentioned validations will
    Validator simply let any exceptions go on to kill the test.

    * (Interface.pm, Engine.pm)  In a reversal of part of release 0.14.0,
    and corresponding to changes introduced in Muldis D spec v0.97.0:  With
    the ::Process role/class, renamed its public method "imp_invo" to
    "proc_invo" and renamed that method's "imperative" parameter to
    "procedure"; this method may now only invoke a Muldis D procedure (or
    system-service), and it may no longer invoke an updater.

    * Transferred the supplementary file
    archives/OSCON2005LightningTalk.txt out of the Muldis-Rosetta
    distribution and into the new Muldis-D-Manual distribution; and so
    Muldis-Rosetta no longer has an archives/ folder.

    * (SeeAlso.pod)  Added new main pod section "FURTHER DOCUMENTATION"
    which refers to the new Muldis::D::Manual distro, just below the
    "FORMAL SPECIFICATION" main pod section.  Also removed the pod
    sub-section "Muldis::Rosetta::Cookbook" of "PROSPECTIVE MULDIS ROSETTA
    EXTENSIONS" because the new section replaces it.  Also minor oth upds.

    * (Interface.pm, README)  Replaced a ref to a possible future
    "Cookbook" distro with a ref to the existing new Muldis-D-Manual dist.

    * Major update to the Makefile.PL (and META.yml) to make its format
    more modern, in particular by distinguishing between dependencies that
    are needed to use the Muldis::Rosetta modules and those needed only for
    testing them or for configuring the distribution; previously, the
    dependencies needed only for testing were treated as if necessary to
    use Muldis::Rosetta itself; also added a list of "resources" urls.

    * (Rosetta.pm)  Simplified the boilerplate Perl code that exists in
    this file for the sole purpose of helping the CPAN indexer.

    * Updated all author references to change Darren Duncan's stated email
    address from "perl@DarrenDuncan.net" to "darren@DarrenDuncan.net".

2009-08-29   Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Muldis Rosetta version 0.14.0 for Perl 5 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-Rosetta-0.14.0.tar.gz.  Muldis Rosetta version 0.14.0 for Perl 6
    is not released at all.  The rest of this Changes entry refers only to
    the Perl 5 version, and it should not be assumed that the Perl 6
    version incorporates all of said updates, though it may have some of
    them.

    * This distribution has excised its direct external dependency on the
    "version" module (bundled with Perl versions 5.10.0+), which was used
    in all .pm files and a .t file.  And so, the modules in this
    distribution now declare floating point version numbers of format
    X.00Y00Z in their code (0.014000 for example); however, all module
    documentation, and the distribution itself, still uses 3-part version
    numbers of format X.Y.Z (0.14.0 for example) as before.  The main
    reason for this change is to gain simplicity and reduce possible bugs.

    * As of this release, Muldis Rosetta for Perl 5 uses the
    namespace::autoclean pragma instead of the namespace::clean pragma,
    because it is easier to use and not so contrived in how it works and is
    a generally recommended upgrade by savvy people.  Note that the newer
    dependency has a larger not-bundled dependency chain, including
    Class::MOP, but this isn't a problem because Muldis Rosetta for Perl 5
    already uses Moose anyway.

    * This distribution has gained a new direct external dependency on the
    Carp::Always module, which currently is only used by the 2 test files.

    * Updated external dependency on Test::More to version 0.92, which
    currently is only used by Validator.pm and a test file, same as what
    used previous versions.  While earlier versions of Test::More are
    bundled with Perl 5, only Perl 5.10.1+ bundles version 0.92, so if
    you're using an older Perl then you must update Test::More from CPAN.
    The tests were updated to no longer declare a planned number of tests
    at the start, but instead to declare "done_testing()" at the finish (a
    feature added by Test::More 0.88).  This change should help make
    further simultaneous development and merging by multiple developers
    less error prone.

    * Updated external dependencies: Moose/etc to version 0.89,
    MooseX::Singleton to version 0.18, Class::MOP to version 0.92.

    * (Interface.pm, Engine.pm)  In accordance with the latest Muldis D
    spec (v0.85.0), with the ::Process role/class, renamed its public
    method "proc_invo" to "imp_invo" and renamed that method's "procedure"
    parameter to "imperative"; this method may now invoke any imperative
    (non-function) Muldis D routine at all, including updaters.

    * (Interface.pm, Validator.pm)  Updated the example|test Muldis D code,
    in accordance with the latest Muldis D spec (v0.85.0): The 'QSet' value
    kind has been renamed to 'Set'.

    * (SeeAlso.pod)  Minor updates.

2009-06-01   Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Muldis Rosetta version 0.13.3 for Perl 5 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-Rosetta-0.13.3.tar.gz.  Muldis Rosetta version 0.13.3 for Perl 6
    is not released at all.  The rest of this Changes entry refers only to
    the Perl 5 version, and it should not be assumed that the Perl 6
    version incorporates all of said updates, though it may have some of
    them.

    * Updated external dependencies: namespace::clean to version 0.11,
    Moose/etc to version 0.79, MooseX::Singleton to version 0.17,
    Class::MOP to version 0.84.

    * (Interface.pm, Validator.pm)  Updated the example|test Muldis D code,
    in accordance with the latest Muldis D spec (v0.75.0): simplified all
    the 'Int' and 'Text' generic context value literals to each be plain
    Perl scalars rather than 2-element Perl arrays, except one because it
    is a direct 'source_code' argument, so the code is considerably less
    verbose now; removed any empty 5th (extensions) parts of Muldis D
    language names, which are now optional; renamed the 4th (dialect) parts
    of Muldis D language names from "_Tiny" to "_STD"; abbreviated any
    invocations of Muldis D system-defined routines since auto-expansion of
    such into their fully-qualified "sys.std.*" names is now normal.

    * (SeeAlso.pod)  Minor formatting updates.

2009-02-09   Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Muldis Rosetta version 0.13.2 for Perl 5 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-Rosetta-0.13.2.tar.gz.  Muldis Rosetta version 0.13.2 for Perl 6
    is not released at all.  The rest of this Changes entry refers only to
    the Perl 5 version, and it should not be assumed that the Perl 6
    version incorporates all of said updates, though it may have some of
    them.

    * Updated external dependencies: Moose/etc to version 0.68.

    * As of this release, Muldis Rosetta for Perl 5 uses the
    namespace::clean pragma for good hygiene; this distribution has now
    gained an external dependency on the Perl 5 module 'namespace::clean',
    which is not bundled with any version of Perl and will need to be
    installed from CPAN; namespace::clean also has a few not-bundled
    dependencies of its own.

    * (Interface.pm, Validator.pm, Example.pm)  Added "use
    namespace::clean" statements inside each package declaration following
    any other "use" statements, so their exports into our packages don't
    also become part of our own public API as a side-effect; the only
    exception is the "meta" method that Moose adds, which is kept.

    * (Interface.pm)  Some POD reformatting:  Took what used to be the 4
    level-2 headings under the INTERFACE level-1 heading and changed said 4
    into level-1 headings, but did not uppercase their text.  Then
    converted the routine lists from being "=over/=item <routine>/=back" to
    each routine having its own level-2 heading.  For each routine, the new
    heading is just the short name of the routine, and the full signature
    of the routine displays just as its own paragraph.  All these changes
    combined should look visually like we are faking 3 levels of headings,
    with top and middle being upcased and mixed case "=head1" respectively.

    * (Interface.pm)  Updated all the routine signatures in the POD to
    prefix each with the word "method" (or in one case, "sub"), and also to
    explicitly name the invocant of all methods as "$self:" (or in the
    sub's case there isn't one).

    * (Interface.pm, SeeAlso.pod)  Minor POD updates.

    * Updated all files with a "LICENSE AND COPYRIGHT" documentation
    section to change the Copyright declaration from "Darren Duncan" to
    "Muldis Data Systems, Inc." (which is wholly owned by Darren Duncan).

2009-01-24   Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Muldis Rosetta version 0.13.1 for Perl 5 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-Rosetta-0.13.1.tar.gz.  Muldis Rosetta version 0.13.1 for Perl 6
    is not released at all.  The rest of this Changes entry refers only to
    the Perl 5 version, and it should not be assumed that the Perl 6
    version incorporates all of said updates, though it may have some of
    them.

    * As of this release, all (non-archive) versioned files have had their
    version numbers increased to match the version number of the release
    itself, or in other words, to match the version number of Rosetta.pm;
    from now on, all file versions will increment in lockstep regardless of
    whether any actual (other) changes were made to the files in question;
    actually, just SeeAlso.pod needed the change as all 4 existing .pm
    files were that way before; and now all new files will follow suit.

    * Updated external dependencies: Moose/etc to version 0.65,
    MooseX::Singleton to version 0.14, Class::MOP to version 0.76.

    * (Interface.pm, Validator.pm)  Updated the example|test Muldis D code,
    in accordance with the latest Muldis D spec (v0.58.0): renamed the
    'HDMD_Perl_Tiny' dialect to 'HDMD_Perl5_Tiny'; updated the payload
    format of 'Relation' value literals so a whole payload goes in a single
    literal node element rather than 2; renamed any 'Relation.\w+' routine
    calls to 'QRelation.\w+' and the 'QuasiSet' type name to 'QSet'.

    * (Interface.pm, Example.pm)  As per the latest Muldis D spec, changed
    any references on 'boot_call' to 'boot_stmt'.

    * (Interface.pm, Validator.pm, Example.pm)  Bugfix in the DEPENDENCIES
    pod sections; replaced any ':ver' with '-ver' in module version labels
    so that the current HTMLizer of search.cpan.org wouldn't mis-parse a
    'version:ver...' label as a literal url of protocol 'version'.

    * (Example.pm)  Exploited new features of Moose version 0.65; the
    "requires" feature of Moose::Role, which is used by Interface.pm which
    is composed by Example.pm, is now satisfied by the various methods that
    are auto-generated by Moose in Example classes ::Public::Process and
    ::Public::Value from the latter's "has" class attribute declarators;
    the auto-gen methods are either attribute accessors or delegates on
    methods of said attributes.  The new features came automatically from
    the Moose version update, but that a cludge of reordering any "with"
    statements to follow rather than precede any affected "has" statements
    in Example.pm was necessary.  The benefit from this update is that
    these 7 explicitly defined Example.pm methods were no longer needed and
    so were deleted: [assoc_machine, pt_command_lang, trans_nest_level,
    start_trans, commit_trans, rollback_trans, assoc_process]; also renamed
    2 class attributes, "_assoc_[machine|process]" to
    "assoc_[machine|process]", and added a "reader" trait to the
    "_pt_command_lang" attribute.

    * (README, Rosetta.pm, SeeAlso.pod)  Added mentions of Set::Relation in
    SUPPORT/FORUMS/"DBMS-RELATED PERL MODULES".

    * (SeeAlso.pod)  Minor updates.

    * Incremented all copyright year range-ends to 2009.

2008-11-08   Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Muldis Rosetta version 0.13.0 for Perl 5 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-Rosetta-0.13.0.tar.gz.  Muldis Rosetta version 0.13.0 for Perl 6
    is not released at all.  The rest of this Changes entry refers only to
    the Perl 5 version, and it should not be assumed that the Perl 6
    version incorporates all of said updates, though it may have some of
    them.

    * New file versions are: Rosetta.pm and Interface.pm and Validator.pm
    and Example.pm 0.13.0 and SeeAlso.pod 0.5.2.  The other pre-existing
    versioned files are unchanged.

    * (Interface.pm)  Updated the API documentation (specifically for the
    'new_value' method) so it no longer says that a Perl-hosted-data
    "Cat.Name" literal requires special handling as a Perl scalar ref; in
    accordance with the latest Muldis D spec, such a literal is now given
    as a Perl Array just like all other hosted-data literals.  Technically
    this detail only concerned the HDMD_Perl_Tiny official Muldis D
    dialect, and other HD dialects may have their own rules.

    * (Interface.pm, Validator.pm)  Updated the example|test Muldis D code,
    in accordance with the latest Muldis D spec; removed any 'perl_int'
    format-specifier elements from value literals.

    * (Interface.pm, Validator.pm, Example.pm)  Updated the formatting of
    module versions in DEPENDENCIES pod sections to reflect modern Perl 6.

    * (SeeAlso.pod)  Minor updates.

2008-09-19   Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Muldis Rosetta version 0.12.0 for Perl 5 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-Rosetta-0.12.0.tar.gz.  Muldis Rosetta version 0.12.0 for Perl 6
    is not released at all.  The rest of this Changes entry refers only to
    the Perl 5 version, and it should not be assumed that the Perl 6
    version incorporates all of said updates, though it may have some of
    them.

    * Updated the README file to indicate that a new public repository at
    http://github.com/muldis/ is planned for the near future.

    * New file versions are: Rosetta.pm and Interface.pm and Validator.pm
    and Example.pm 0.12.0.  The other pre-existing versioned files are
    unchanged.

    * (Interface.pm)  The new_machine routine no longer tries to validate
    its $engine_name argument as to whether or not Perl 5 considers it to
    be a valid character string; the argument is now only validated for
    definedness and non-empty-ness.  It turns out that there isn't really
    any effective Perl 5 test for whether an arbitrary string argument is
    text, and it is really just up to the code that exchanges data with the
    outside world (files, networks, databases, etc) to ensure it is using
    Encode's decode() and encode() etc when it should be; so for us, worst
    case is we interpret the string as the wrong characters, due to our
    caller making a mistake, and it is up to them to fix it.  Note, this
    all being said, any future routine that expects a binary string
    argument can still assert that is_utf8() is false as a validation step.

    * (Interface.pm, Example.pm, Validator.pm,
    Muldis_Rosetta_50_Validate_Example.t)  The Machine role|class
    constructor submethod no longer has any parameters, and the new_machine
    constructor wrapper functions now have just the single 'engine_name'
    parameter; they all, as well as the 'main' procedure of Validator.pm,
    no longer have a 'machine_config' parameter.  From now on, if a Machine
    would have any config options of its own, they will be set using
    accessors on a Machine object rather than in its constructor.  Also
    updated the corresponding 'process_config' parameter for the Process
    role|class and its wrappers, restricting it such that it must be a Perl
    Hash (or be undefined), rather than Interface.pm saying it may be
    anything and be up to each Engine to restrict its own way.

    * (Interface.pm, Example.pm)  The Machine role|class is now a
    singleton, such that each Muldis Rosetta Engine may only have one
    Machine object per Perl process, and that Machine thus serves as a
    proxy for the Engine as a whole, any methods on it being "global";
    updated the Interface.pm docs to say so.  To help implement this in
    Example.pm, added external dependency on MooseX::Singleton, which now
    provides the metaclass for Example's Machine class rather than just
    Moose doing that.

    * (Interface.pm)  In a reversal of one aspect of release 0.11.0,
    updated the API documentation so it no longer says that a Process
    object's defined "expected pt|hd command language" attribute will take
    precedence over a declared language name used per command; so it is now
    the case that the most local defined language declaration will take
    precedence when it might conceivably be applicable; but the
    documentation now mainly just implies that fact rather than explicitly
    stating it, since typical user intuition should point to the truth.

    * (Interface.pm, Example.pm)  Updated the Process|Value role|class so
    that all routines with a 'source_code' parameter (that is, 'execute',
    'new_value', the 3 'invo') now have an extra 1 or 2 optional parameters
    named 'lang' or '[pt|hd]_lang'.  In the case of all Interface::Value
    construction, either direct ('new_value') or indirect (from ro-args of
    the 3 'invo'), it turns out that 'source_code' typically can't embed a
    language declaration after all (what the previous API assumed), and so
    the new parameters allow a per-source language declaration to be
    supplied; so it is now mandatory for each source to get a language
    declaration either from the new parameter or from the invocant Process'
    expected language attribute, except when the source is already a Value
    object.  In the case of 'execute', typically its 'source_code' *can*
    embed a language declaration, and if it does then an external supply as
    per Value construction isn't needed.

    * (Example.pm)  Under the DESCRIPTION main pod section, added pod
    sub-section "Implementation and Limitations" which has a few details
    about broad design decisions that go into the Example Engine, such as
    how its implementation uses the SQLite DBMS as a model, loosely
    speaking, and that it is mainly a RAM-based DBMS.  Also added an
    initial something to the BUGS AND LIMITATIONS main pod section, and
    updated the INTERFACE section.

2008-09-03   Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Muldis Rosetta version 0.11.1 for Perl 5 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-Rosetta-0.11.1.tar.gz.  Muldis Rosetta version 0.11.1 for Perl 6
    is not released at all.  The rest of this Changes entry refers only to
    the Perl 5 version, and it should not be assumed that the Perl 6
    version incorporates all of said updates, though it may have some of
    them.

    * New file versions are: Rosetta.pm and Interface.pm and Validator.pm
    and Example.pm 0.11.1.  The other pre-existing versioned files are
    unchanged.

    * Updated the Makefile.PL to remove the obsolete warning message about
    a warning message that the POD manifyer might give.

    * (Validator.pm)  Removed routine does_ok(), which was a slightly
    modified clone of Test::More's isa_ok().  Instead, added dependency on
    Test::Moose, which provides routines to complement Test::More.

    * Muldis Rosetta version 0.11.0 for Perl 5 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-Rosetta-0.11.0.tar.gz.  Muldis Rosetta version 0.11.0 for Perl 6
    is not released at all.  The rest of this Changes entry refers only to
    the Perl 5 version, and it should not be assumed that the Perl 6
    version incorporates all of said updates, though it may have some of
    them.

    * New file versions are: Rosetta.pm and Interface.pm and Validator.pm
    and Example.pm 0.11.0.  The other pre-existing versioned files are
    unchanged.

    * (Interface.pm)  Updated the API documentation to fix a certain
    ambiguity problem with source code.  It now says that any supplied
    source code that is a Perl Str is always treated as being some
    plain-text language, and source code that is any kind of Perl 5
    reference or object is always treated as being some Perl-hosted-data
    language; to disambiguate Perl-hosted-data source code that consists of
    just a "Cat.Name" literal (which is normally specified as a Perl Str
    rather than a Perl Array) from general plain-text code, Muldis Rosetta
    now requires one to specify such Perl-hosted-data source code by
    supplying source code which is a Perl 5 reference to a Perl Str, rather
    than supplying it as a plain Perl Str.

    * (Engine.pm)  Removed any 'use Carp' within class defs, since it turns
    out that Moose exports its 'confess' into our classes for us.  (It also
    exports 'blessed' of Scalar::Util.)

    * (Interface.pm, Example.pm)  Removed the 2 role|class methods
    "Machine.assoc_processes" and "Process.assoc_values", which seem to be
    of dubious value; if in the future it turns out they actually would be
    useful after all, they might then return.  Also removed the 2
    corresponding attributes from Example since they aren't needed.

    * (Interface.pm, Example.pm, Validator.pm)  Split up the conceptual
    Process attribute "expected command language" into the 2 "expected
    plain-text|perl-hosted-data command language", so now the plain-text
    and Perl-hosted-data language groupings each have their default which
    can be unset or set that just affects work with that language group.
    Split up the Process role|class' 2 "[|update_]command_lang" methods
    into the 4 "[|update_][pt|hd]_command_lang" methods; also updated the
    "pt" versions to return/take a Perl Str, and the "hd" to return/take a
    Perl Array, rather than return/take Any.  Similarly split up the Value
    role|class' 1 "source_code" method into the 2 "[pt|hd]_source_code"
    methods; the return/take data types were similarly changed except that
    the "hd" still results in Any.

    * (Interface.pm)  Updated the API documentation to specify that when a
    Process object has a defined "expected pt|hd command language"
    attribute, then all pt|hd source code given to that process or built by
    that process must be of that language; any declared language names used
    per command may only be respected when the attribute is undefined.

    * (Interface.pm, Validator.pm)  Updated the example|test Muldis D code
    to use the less verbose ordered-attributes relation literal syntax
    where the result doesn't make the file lines too long.

    * (Example.pm)  Made several large Example.pm updates so that its code
    more closely resembles what it would be once the other implementing
    files of the Example Engine were added.  Added commented-out dependency
    statements on 4 new files in the Example/ namespace: Runtime, Value,
    PlainText, HostedData; it is also expected that those files in turn
    would depend on yet more files such as: Storage, Operators, etc.  Added
    new private attribute "_inner" to each of the Machine|Process|Value
    classes (but in the last it is a rename from "_value"), whose declared
    types are of classes that would be declared in either Runtime or Value;
    the ::Public classes in Example.pm would then be serving as
    public-facing wrappers for said.  Removed the private attributes
    "_[machine|process]_config", "_trans_nest_level", since the "inner"
    Machine|Process will have those instead.  Stripped down the 4
    "trans"-named methods of Process so they now simply delegate to the
    "inner" Process object's same methods, which would then do the work
    that the stripped no longer do.  Fleshed out the Value class' BUILD
    submethod and 2 "source_code" methods so that they properly invoke the
    Muldis D source code parsers or builders that PlainText|HostedData
    provide, by which the outside world interacts with the "inner" Value.

    * Muldis Rosetta version 0.10.0 for Perl 5 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-Rosetta-0.10.0.tar.gz.  Muldis Rosetta version 0.10.0 for Perl 6
    is not released at all.  The rest of this Changes entry refers only to
    the Perl 5 version, and it should not be assumed that the Perl 6
    version incorporates all of said updates, though it may have some of
    them.

    * New file versions are: Rosetta.pm and Interface.pm and Validator.pm
    and Example.pm 0.10.0.  The other pre-existing versioned files are
    unchanged.

    * (Interface.pm)  Fixed the documentation of 'new_value' to say it will
    clone a Value object given as its 'source_code' argument, rather than
    simply return the same object.

    * (Engine.pm)  Renamed Process|Value attr 'machine'|'process' to prefix
    'assoc_', and the corresponding Process|Value constructor parameter was
    likewise renamed; corresponding updates to new_[process|value] methods.

    * (Engine.pm)  Renamed all attributes of all classes to prepend an
    underscore to their names.  Fleshed out all the Moose 'has'
    declarations of said attributes, so that they are all "is rw" and so
    have auto-generated accessor methods of the same (new) names of the
    attributes.  Updated all Engine.pm code to use these attr accessor
    methods rather than using direct $self hash accesses.  Further fleshed
    out the 'has' to define their initialization from either default
    literals or constructor params, as well as marking any constructor
    params that are required, and a few with other constraints.  The BUILD
    submethods are now considerably smaller with most of their contents now
    replaced by the 'has'.  Some of the more complicated input checking and
    post-processing remains in the BUILD though.

2008-08-04   Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Muldis Rosetta version 0.9.0 for Perl 5 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-Rosetta-0.9.0.tar.gz.  Muldis Rosetta version 0.9.0 for Perl 6
    is not released at all.  The rest of this Changes entry refers only to
    the Perl 5 version, and it should not be assumed that the Perl 6
    version incorporates all of said updates, though it may have some of
    them.

    * New file versions are: Rosetta.pm and Interface.pm and Validator.pm
    and Example.pm 0.9.0.  The other pre-existing versioned files are
    unchanged.

    * As of this release, Muldis Rosetta for Perl 5 uses the Moose
    postmodern object system for Perl 5; this distribution has now gained
    an external dependency on the Perl 5 framework 'Moose', which is not
    bundled with any version of Perl and will need to be installed from
    CPAN; Moose also has a few not-bundled dependencies of its own.

    * (Interface.pm, Example.pm)  Updated the 3 Interface roles
    Machine|Process|Value to actually declare themselves as roles using
    Moose::Role, and updated the 3 corresponding Example Engine classes to
    actually declare themselves as Moose classes, and as composing said 3
    roles (using the Moose 'with' keyword).  Also updated the 'new_machine'
    submethod of Muldis::Rosetta::Interface to retain compatability with
    the isa() to does() change.

    * (Validator.pm)  Updated the does_ok() utility routine to actually
    perform a does() test rather than isa(); this involved cloning the
    isa_ok() of Test::More into Validator.pm, with a few small changes.

    * (Example.pm)  Renamed all the _build submethods to BUILD, removed all
    the new(), and renamed all the DESTROY to DEMOLISH, since Moose now
    takes care of the framing bits for us.

    * (Example.pm)  Removed all the constant declarations that are class
    attribute names, just using their string literal values directly as the
    $self hash keys.  Also added Moose 'has' declarations for all the class
    attributes, though currently they probably don't do anything since we
    still manually specify everything with BUILD, DEMOLISH, and explicit
    accessor methods; this is expected to change in a future release.

2008-08-02   Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Muldis Rosetta version 0.8.0 for Perl 5 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-Rosetta-0.8.0.tar.gz.  Muldis Rosetta version 0.8.0 for Perl 6
    is not released at all.  The rest of this Changes entry refers only to
    the Perl 5 version, and it should not be assumed that the Perl 6
    version incorporates all of said updates, though it may have some of
    them.

    * New file versions are: Rosetta.pm and Interface.pm and Validator.pm
    and Example.pm 0.8.0 and SeeAlso.pod 0.5.1.

    * (Rosetta.pm)  Updated the DESCRIPTION pod to say that the Perl DBI
    and Muldis Rosetta are more similar, specifically that both do not
    require the commands they process to be of any specific language, and
    also that they both typically take multiple language dialects.

    * (Interface.pm, Example.pm)  Removed the API roles|classes named
    "[Func|Proc]Binding", thereby majorly simplifying the public API of a
    Rosetta Engine; also removed the associated attributes|accessors of the
    "Process" role|class.  You now simply invoke a Muldis D routine
    directly using a "Process" method.

    * (Interface.pm, Example.pm, Validator.pm)  Renamed the Process
    role|class' "call_[func|proc]" methods to "[func|proc]_invo", and split
    the latter into itself and "upd_invo"; also renamed each method's
    primary argument.  A result of these changes is that these 3 methods
    are now direct counterparts to certain Muldis D system-defined routines
    or expr|stmt node types, that have the same names.

    * (Interface.pm, Example.pm, Validator.pm)  Made the "machine_config"
    parameter of the Machine constructor function and its wrapper function
    optional.  Added an optional "process_config" parameter for the Process
    constructor and its wrapper method that is analogous to this.  Added a
    "process_config" parameter to Validator.pm's "main" procedure, and
    updated Muldis_Rosetta_50_Validate_Example.t to pass it an argument.

    * (Interface.pm, Example.pm, Validator.pm)  Removed the 'exp_ast_lang'
    attribute from the Machine role|class, and added as a replacement the
    'command_lang' attribute to the Process role|class; replaced the
    corresponding accessor methods likewise.  The new attribute is not
    required to have a defined value like the old attribute, and the new
    can not be initialized using a constructor parameter like the old, but
    can only be set with the accessor method.  If 'command_lang' is
    undefined (as by default), then each command fed to a Process must
    declare the language it is written in; if 'command_lang' is defined,
    then each command need not declare, and is interpreted as being written
    in the language named by 'command_lang'.  Overall, these changes permit
    one to supply commands in multiple languages to the same DBMS, while
    still not having to be verbose.  Also the language doesn't have to be
    Muldis D, but could be SQL or something else the Engine accepts.

    * (Example.pm)  Fleshed out the INTERFACE pod section to specify what
    command languages the Example Engine accepts as input; currently it is
    just the 2 official Muldis D "Tiny" dialects.

    * (Interface.pm, Example.pm, Validator.pm)  Replaced the API role|class
    Var with Value, as it now represents an immutable value rather than a
    mutable variable.  The Muldis Rosetta API now just uses ordinary Perl
    variables as its variables in Perl routines; they are valued with Value
    objects, and you update them in Perl space like you do with Perl vars.

    * (Interface.pm, Example.pm)  Added new 'execute' method to the Process
    role|class, which lets you simply execute any code that the Engine
    understands against the DBMS; this is how you run Muldis D 'bootloader'
    routine code in Muldis Rosetta.

    * (Interface.pm, Engine.pm, Validator.pm, SeeAlso.pod)  Made other misc
    updates, such as bringing code samples, tests up to date with the API.

    * The file archives/OSCON2008SessionProposal.txt was moved from the
    Muldis Rosetta version control / distribution to the Muldis D one; also
    there is now just one copy versus with 2 versions of Muldis Rosetta.

    * Deleted the file archives/OSCON2006SessionProposal.txt which proposes
    a talk that was never accepted for giving, and that in retrospect
    wasn't a particularly good proposal; I decided there is little benefit
    in keeping this one-pager proposal, so away it goes.

2008-04-12   Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Muldis Rosetta version 0.7.0 for Perl 5 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-Rosetta-0.7.0.tar.gz.  Muldis Rosetta version 0.7.0 for Perl 6
    is not released at all.  The rest of this Changes entry refers only to
    the Perl 5 version, but it also happens that the Perl 6 version was
    also brought fully up to date along with it.

    * What was Muldis-DB at version 0.6.2 has been renamed to
    Muldis-Rosetta.  This is the first release of the Muldis-Rosetta
    distribution, and the first release of any distribution to contain Perl
    5 package names like Muldis::Rosetta[|::\w+].  All of the files in this
    distribution are as identical as possible to how they were when last
    released under the names Muldis::DB[|::\w+] but for the name changes.
    All lib/ files were renamed appropriately, and also the 2
    t/Muldis_DB_\w+ were renamed to t/Muldis_Rosetta_\w+.

    * All versioned files had their version numbers incremented to the
    first higher 0.N.0.  New file versions are: Rosetta.pm and Interface.pm
    and Validator.pm and Example.pm 0.7.0 and SeeAlso.pod 0.5.0.

    * (Rosetta.pm)  The TRADEMARK POLICY section was severely edited to
    excise most legalese, and is now just half its previous size; the old
    longer version was shunted off to the Muldis Data Systems' website.

    * (Interface.pm, Validator.pm)  Update to retain compatibility with the
    official Muldis D version 0.25.0, where the second (authority) part of
    a fully-qualified Muldis D language name has changed from
    'cpan:DUNCAND' to 'http://muldis.com'.

    * (SeeAlso.pod)  A few minor updates.

    * Minor update to the file archives/OSCON2008SessionProposal.txt which
    reflects that the proposal was accepted; the talk will be given Jul 23.
    Also retconned the file to use current names, urls of Muldis D|Rosetta;
    the copy on the OSCON website will likewise be updated if possible.

    * This is the Muldis-Rosetta-0.7.0 file manifest:

    * Muldis DB version 0.6.2 for Perl 5 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-DB-0.6.2.tar.gz.  Muldis DB version 0.6.2 for Perl 6 is not
    released at all.  The rest of this Changes entry refers only to the
    Perl 5 version, and it should not be assumed that the Perl 6 version
    incorporates all of said updates, though it may have some of them.

    * Renamed the 2 t/MDB_\w+ test files to t/Muldis_DB_\w+.

    * New file versions are: DB.pm and Interface.pm and Validator.pm and
    Example.pm 0.6.2 and SeeAlso.pod 0.4.4.

    * Updated DB.pm and the README file to clarify that commercial support
    is available from the author specifically by way of Muldis Data
    Systems.

    * Updated all .pm and .pod files to add a new TRADEMARK POLICY section
    near the end of each; it serves for trademarks what the LICENSE AND
    COPYRIGHT did for copyrights.  The DB.pm file had the actual text, and
    the other files simply say to look at DB.pm.  To summarize, the word
    MULDIS is a trademark and how you may use it has limitations.

    * (DB.pm, Interface.pm, Validator.pm, SeeAlso.pod)  A few minor updates
    to reflect the fact that, for one thing, the Muldis D official spec is
    now released under the Perl main package namespace Muldis::D rather
    than Language::MuldisD, and for another thing, some small aspects of
    Muldis DB's reflection of the Muldis D language were out of date, but
    now they were updated to resync.

2008-03-10   Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Muldis DB version 0.6.1 for Perl 5 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-DB-0.6.1.tar.gz.  Muldis DB version 0.6.1 for Perl 6 is not
    released at all.  The rest of this Changes entry refers only to the
    Perl 5 version, and it should not be assumed that the Perl 6 version
    incorporates all of said updates, though it may have some of them.

    * New file versions are: DB.pm and Interface.pm and Validator.pm and
    Example.pm 0.6.1 and SeeAlso.pod 0.4.3.

    * Updated the README file to emphasize the Perl 5 version for now.

    * (SeeAlso.pod)  A few minor updates.

    * Incremented all copyright year range-ends to 2008.

    * Added new file archives/OSCON2008SessionProposal.txt which is a copy
    of a proposal to give a talk on Muldis D + DB at OSCON 2008 (it can
    also be given elsewhere); this is likely the most succinct description
    yet of what the projects are and why one would want to use them.

2008-03-10   Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Muldis DB for Perl 6 has suspended development temporarily while
    resources are focused on just Muldis DB for Perl 5 in the short term;
    later on, when the Perl 5 version is sufficiently advanced, it will be
    translated to Perl 6, so to restart parallel development, or at least
    to provide a snapshot.  In the meantime, some updates to the Perl 6
    version may still be made, but it should not be interpreted that these
    are keeping the whole project in feature parity with the Perl 5 one.

2007-12-09   Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Muldis DB version 0.6.0 for Perl 5 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-DB-0.6.0.tar.gz.  Muldis DB version 0.6.0 for Perl 6 is not
    released at all.  The rest of this Changes entry refers only to the
    Perl 5 version.

    * As of this release, the in-code $VERSION declarations of all Perl 5
    packages in this distribution are changed to match the X.Y.Z format
    that the same packages' own VERSION POD had all along (the old in-code
    format was X.00Y00Z).  A consequence of this change is that this
    distribution has gained an external dependency on the Perl 5 module
    'version', which is not bundled with Perl 5.8.x; however, it *is*
    bundled with Perl 5.10.x, so if you are using that newer Perl, you
    won't have to install 'version' separately from CPAN.

    * New file versions are: DB.pm and Interface.pm and Validator.pm and
    Example.pm 0.6.0 and SeeAlso.pm 0.4.2.

    * (Interface.pm, Example.pm, Validator.pm, DB.pm, SeeAlso.pod,
    MDB_50_Validate_Example.t)  Renamed all Perl packages named ::DBMS to
    ::Machine (that is, under Interface:: and Example::Public::), and
    similarly renamed all routines, attributes, parameters, variables,
    config keys, and so on, to use 'machine' rather than 'dbms'.

    * (Interface.pm, Example.pm, Validator.pm)  Split the Machine
    role|class into itself and the new Process role|class; a Machine now
    has 0..N Process, and a Process now has 0..N
    Var|FuncBinding|ProcBinding.  The Machine constructor retained all of
    its parameters, and the Process constructor has no configuration
    parameters; nearly all of the Machine methods went to Process.  As part
    of the split, 2 methods were added to Machine, and 1 to Process.

2007-10-20   Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Muldis DB version 0.5.0 for Perl 5 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-DB-0.5.0.tar.gz.  Muldis DB version 0.5.0 for Perl 6 is not
    released at all.  The rest of this Changes entry refers only to the
    Perl 5 version.

    * Removed the files PhysType.pm and Operators.pm; these files were very
    out of date and will be replaced later (possibly under the same names).

    * New file versions are: DB.pm and Interface.pm and Validator.pm and
    Example.pm 0.5.0 and SeeAlso.pm 0.4.1.

    * (Interface.pm, Example.pm, Validator.pm)  Added a new attribute to
    the DBMS role (and Example's doing class), "expected AST language",
    with which Muldis DB users explicitly declare what Muldis DB (or
    alternative) language version they expect to use for further
    interaction with that DBMS.  The new_dbms constructor function gains a
    parameter ('exp_ast_lang') for setting its default value, and the DBMS
    role gains 2 methods for fetching/updating that attribute.  Note that,
    unlike the engine_name and dbms_config parameters, exp_ast_lang is
    generally not suited to read from a config file, as it is meant to
    correspond to program code rather than a user's runtime setting.  The
    &main of Validator.pm was updated to provide a hard-coded argument for
    exp_ast_lang, which will be maintained in future releases at the latest
    official Muldis D version number known to work at the time.

    * (DB.pm)  Some small DESCRIPTION pod updates.

    * (SeeAlso.pod)  Added more prospective extension modules.

    * Fleshed out the tail of this Changes file with a summary pre-release
    (rel. 2007 June) history of Muldis DB; going from mid-2002 to mid-2007.

2007-09-22   Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Muldis DB version 0.4.0 for Perl 5 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-DB-0.4.0.tar.gz.  Muldis DB version 0.4.0 for Perl 6 is not
    released at all.  The rest of this Changes entry refers only to the
    Perl 5 version.

    * This release is a snapshot to show a particular mid-way point in a
    large sequence of changes.  To summarize, the public API of Muldis DB
    has been rewritten, documentation for that API was added (including an
    example), and both the Example Engine and the Validator suite were
    (substantially) updated to conform to the new API.  However, the
    Example Engine is still incapable of executing any tasks, so that
    aspect is unchanged from before.  The next release should flesh out
    Example so that it executes some tasks.

    * Removed the file Literal.pm; Muldis DB now uses Perl Hosted Abstract
    Muldis D (composed of Perl array refs, hash refs, scalars), as
    described in Language::MuldisD::PerlHosted, rather than Literal
    objects, as its data|code interchange format.  This makes things a lot
    simpler, easier to use, and better performing.  All of the other .pm
    files in this distribution, which used Literal.pm, were updated
    accordingly, which is further described below.  Also removed the
    t/MDB_10_Literal_Simple.t test file.

    * All versioned files had their version numbers brought up to 0.4.0.

    * Minor updates to all versioned files such that most references to the
    project name were changed to "Muldis DB" from "Muldis::DB".

    * (DB.pm, Interface.pm, Example.pm)  Updates to various
    main/introductory documentation.  Half rewrote/prepended the
    DESCRIPTION of DB.pm.  Added a small initial DESCRIPTION to each of
    Interface.pm, Example.pm.  Further minor edits to other sections.

    * (Interface.pm)  Rewrote 90% of the code to provide a substantially
    different, though similar, API.  The new_dbms function of the
    Muldis::DB::Interface module now has a modified version of what code
    used to be in the constructor submethod of ::DBMS (it is the code that
    loads an Engine and invokes it to make a ::DBMS object), rather than
    the former being an optional wrapper for the latter.  All remaining
    ::Interface::\w+ named packages of Interface.pm are now just roles that
    declare method interfaces but don't implement any, and the
    correspondingly named Engine classes must inherit said roles and
    implement the methods; they are no longer wrapper classes that do
    validation on behalf of, and then invoke, the Engines, but rather the
    Engines must do their own input validation now, and user applications
    are now invoking the public Engine classes directly.  The
    ::Engine::Role[|::\w+] roles that used to be in Interface.pm are now
    gone, as they are now redundant; the new ::Interface::\w+ are like what
    they used to be.  The new Interface.pm do not declare constructor
    interfaces, since users should now only be making objects indirectly by
    way of methods of another class.  The ::HostGateVar class/role was
    renamed to ::Var, the ::HostGateRtn was renamed to ::ProcBinding, and a
    similar ::FuncBinding was added.  The ::[DBMS|Var|[Func|Proc]Binding]
    roles were further substantially altered, with some methods renamed and
    others added.  Perhaps the most substantial difference of the new API
    for actual functionality is that there is no distinct "prepare" method
    any more, rather all action methods are of the "execute" (now called
    "call") variety.  How this works is you first call() a DDL routine, its
    argument being the definition of the (now always named) user-defined
    routine you want to compile; then you call() that newly created
    routine.  In a related fashion, if you just want to invoke existing
    system or (already loaded / in-mounted-database) user-defined routines,
    you can just call() them like they were Perl routines, with no separate
    DDL/prepare step.  The [Func|Proc]Binding roles aren't actually needed
    for anything, as the DBMS role provides call_[func|proc] methods, which
    in either case just alias to an already compiled routine, but the 2
    Binding roles are provided for now in case they may add some efficiency
    due to less repeated input validation or such.

    * (Interface.pm)  Rewrote and/or added 90% of the INTERFACE pod; unlike
    the old API which had practically no documentation, the new API is
    fully documented.  Also added an initial SYNOPSIS documentation block,
    which illustrates invoking the system-defined relational join operator,
    where the arguments and result are Perl-lexical variables; this is the
    first actual example code for using Muldis DB, however contrived.

    * (Example.pm)  Rewrote the Example.pm code to conform to the changed
    API declared by Interface.pm.  The new version implements the root
    module, the ::DBMS and ::Var classes, but not the ::[Func|Proc]Binding
    classes.  Also, the interface-role implementing classes were all
    renamed aside from interface-conformity, specifically "::Public" was
    added to all their names, that signifying that these are the only
    classes that applications would directly invoke.  This file stands to
    be substantially updated in the next releases, but for the most part
    most Example code will be put in other files, with Example.pm limited
    to providing just the public interface.

    * (PhysType.pm, Operators.pm)  Made a minimal set of updates to these
    files to bring them up to date with the current Muldis D type or
    routine names for what they implement, and to remove any references to
    Literal.pm.  These files stand to be substantially updated, or even
    replaced in the next releases.

    * (Validator.pm)  Rewrote the foods/suppliers/shipments scenario, which
    is basically all the code, so it uses the new API in Interface.pm; this
    version is barely half the code size of the old one, but it doesn't
    create a user-defined routine to combine the tasks to be done; an
    additional version will be provided in a subsequent release that does.
    The SYNOPSIS, plus the MDB_50_Validate_Example.t, were minor updated.

    * (Validator.pm)  Added a &does_ok to Validator.pm, which in the Perl 6
    Validator.pm is a modified copy of the &isa_ok of Test.pm but it tests
    with .does rather than .isa; in the Perl 5 Validator.pm, the new
    &does_ok is just a symbolic alias for the Test::More &isa_ok; in any
    event, the rest of both versions of Validator.pm now invokes &does_ok
    rather than &isa_ok, to keep their code bases more similar.

    * (SeeAlso.pod)  Updated the PROSPECTIVE MULDIS DB EXTENSIONS section
    mainly to bring various names, terminology, and references up to date
    with design changes.  Any package names containing "Literal" now have
    "PHMD" instead, and any docs refering to "Muldis DB AST nodes" now
    refer to "Perl Hosted Muldis D".  Re-added the
    Muldis::DB::AST::StringRepr module that was removed in release 0.1.0
    under the new name Muldis::DB::PHMD::Translate::ConcreteMuldisD (it's
    not part of Literal.pm anymore).  Other small renames and changes.

    * Updated the TODO file.

2007-09-14   Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Muldis DB version 0.3.2 for Perl 5 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-DB-0.3.2.tar.gz.  Muldis DB version 0.3.2 for Perl 6 is not
    released at all.  The rest of this Changes entry refers only to the
    Perl 5 version.

    * Removed the file Copying.pod; it isn't particularly useful anymore.

    * New file versions are: DB.pm 0.3.2.  The other pre-existing versioned
    files are unchanged.

    * (DB.pm)  The whole Muldis DB core, that is, all code in this
    distribution, has been re-licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public
    License version 3 or later (LGPLv3+).  Also, the current plan is that
    the LGPLv3+ will be used as the license of many separately distributed
    Muldis DB extensions started by the same author, such as some
    implementations over SQL databases, or such as example code in
    tutorials/cookbooks; or some extensions would be under other
    GPLv3-compatible licenses.

    * Muldis DB version 0.3.1 for Perl 5 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-DB-0.3.1.tar.gz.  Muldis DB version 0.3.1 for Perl 6 is not
    released at all.  The rest of this Changes entry refers only to the
    Perl 5 version.

    * Renamed DB.pod to DB.pm, and added an empty dummy package declaration
    of Muldis::DB to it, all for the sole purpose of helping the CPAN
    indexer link to this distribution properly; it doesn't work when the
    namespace file is plain pod.  For similar reasons, the version number
    of DB.pm will now always be kept in sync with the whole-distribution
    version number declared in the Makefile.PL.

    * New file versions are: DB.pm and Copying.pod 0.3.1.  The other
    pre-existing versioned files are unchanged.

    * (DB.pm, Copying.pod)  The license of Muldis DB has been simplified
    to no longer be the duality of the GPL and Affero GPL, as the Affero
    GPL option is dropped; this is because the Affero option didn't seem to
    provide any clear benefit, and the GPL is regardless compatible with
    the Affero GPL with respect to combining works into larger works, which
    is all that is truly important.

    * (DB.pm, Copying.pod)  The file DB.pm has been re-licensed under the
    Lesser GPL, while the rest of this distribution remains under the GPL.
    While not immediately the case (due to technicalities), in the near
    future, that will mean that the LGPL will cover all mandatory
    components (a minority), and the GPL all or most optional components of
    the Muldis DB framework.  Accordingly, the file LICENSE/LGPL was added
    to this distro, which contains the text of the LGPL version 3.0.

2007-07-24   Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Muldis::DB version 0.3.0 for Perl 5 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-DB-0.3.0.tar.gz.  Muldis::DB version 0.3.0 for Perl 6 is not
    released at all.  The rest of this Changes entry refers only to the
    Perl 5 version.

    * What was Muldis-DB at version 0.2.0 and earlier, has been split in 2,
    with the parts to be Language-MuldisD and Muldis-DB, each at version
    0.3.0 and later.  Prior to the split, both the Perl 5 and Perl 6
    versions of Muldis-DB contained identical copies of what became
    Language-MuldisD; after the split, neither Muldis-D had a copy.

    * All versioned files had their version numbers brought up to 0.3.0.

    * This release saw no code changes at all.  About half of SeeAlso.pod
    was stripped out, since that stayed only with Language-MuldisD.

    * This is the Muldis-DB-0.3.0 file manifest:

2007-07-20   Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Muldis::DB version 0.2.0 for Perl 5 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-DB-0.2.0.tar.gz.  Muldis::DB version 0.2.0 for Perl 6 is not
    released at all.  The rest of this Changes entry refers only to the
    Perl 5 version, specifically the portions that were not split-off into
    Language-MuldisD following release 0.2.0.

    * Renamed AST.pm to Literal.pm, and split up DB.pm into DB.pod and
    Interface.pm.  Any code that used to be spelled Muldis::DB::AST or
    Muldis::DB is now spelled Muldis::DB::Literal and
    Muldis::DB::Interface.  Following these changes, lib/Muldis/DB.pod is
    still the "main" file for documentation purposes, but for code
    purposes, both Literal.pm and Interface.pm are now used directly.

    * New file versions are: DB.pod and Literal.pm and Interface.pm and
    Language.pod and Validator.pm and Example.pm 0.2.0.

    * Updated Literal.pm to remove all exported functions that trivially
    wrap an object constructor, updated any uses in other files to call
    constructors directly.  Also renamed ::[Bool|Order|Int|Blob|Text]Lit to
    remove the "Lit", and ::[|Quasi][Tuple|Relation]Sel to remove the
    "Sel", and likewise updated any refs to said.

    * In both Literal.pm and PhysType.pm, renamed any classes named
    [TypeInvo|TypeDict|ExprDict|ValueDict][|NQ|AQ] to [_\1|\1|Quasi\1]
    respectively, and refs to said.

2007-07-11   Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Muldis::DB version 0.1.0 for Perl 5 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-DB-0.1.0.tar.gz.  Muldis::DB version 0.1.0 for Perl 6 is not
    released at all.  The rest of this Changes entry refers only to the
    Perl 5 version, specifically the portions that were not split-off into
    Language-MuldisD following release 0.2.0.

    * This is a major release that focuses on overhauling or defining part
    of the Muldis D meta-model / system catalog, which is essential for
    supporting any user-defined DBMS entities, that is, for doing anything
    remotely useful.  Said overhaul is expected to be staged over 3-4
    consecutive releases, of which the current one is essentially just
    updating documentation; not much code was changed by this release.

    * New code file versions are: DB.pm and AST.pm and Validator.pm and
    Example.pm 0.1.0.

    * As of this release, all pod-only files now also have version numbers,
    shown in the VERSION docs by NAME, like code-containing modules do; the
    initial version numbers are all 0.1.0.

    * Muldis D now has 2 representation formats (Concrete Muldis D,
    Abstract Muldis D) rather than 3 (relations, ASTs, strings).

    * Updated SeeAlso.pod to remove the proposal for a separately
    distributed Muldis::DB::AST::StringRepr module; instead,
    Muldis::DB::AST will parse and generate Concrete Muldis D by itself.

    * Rearranged any relevant docs and code so that the most important core
    scalar types are now in the order [Bool, Int, Blob, Text] and the
    relation type factory Maybe now appears after Set.

    * Muldis D now has a new scalar data type, "Order", which is an
    enumeration (like "Bool" is) of 3 values: [Increase, Same, Decrease];
    it is the result type of any dyadic comparison operator that underlies
    the likes of less|greater-than or min|max or sorting operations.  Both
    AST.pm and PhysType.pm were updated to include this type.

2007-06-29   Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Muldis::DB version 0.0.1 for Perl 5 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-DB-0.0.1.tar.gz.  Muldis::DB version 0.0.1 for Perl 6 is not
    released at all.  The rest of this Changes entry refers only to the
    Perl 5 version, specifically the portions that were not split-off into
    Language-MuldisD following release 0.2.0.

    * New code file versions are: DB.pm and AST.pm and Validator.pm and
    Example.pm 0.0.1.

    * The primary purpose of this release is to re-license Muldis::DB under
    actual free software licenses, specifically version 3 of the GPL family
    of licenses, which the Free Software Foundation formally published on
    2007 June 29th.  By contrast, the previous Muldis::DB releases were
    under an expiring proprietary license, with just the promise of a free
    re-license to come.  Accordingly, the file LICENSE/GPL was added to
    this distro, which contains the text of the GPL version 3.0.

    * This release also includes a collection of small documentation
    updates and fixes, such as the following:  We now use the official
    typography for the names 'TTM' and 'D' and such.  Added a DOCUMENTATION
    READING ORDER section to the README file.  Added the 2007 June 4th
    Muldis::DB namespace registration (to the official CPAN module list)
    notice to the Changes file.  Updated parts of DB.pm and Copying.pod
    concerning licensing matters.  This release has no code changes.

2007-06-20   Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Muldis::DB version 0.0.0 for Perl 5 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-DB-0.0.0.tar.gz.  Muldis::DB version 0.0.0 for Perl 6 is not
    released at all.  The rest of this Changes entry refers only to the
    Perl 5 version, specifically the portions that were not split-off into
    Language-MuldisD following release 0.2.0.

    * This is the first release of the Perl 5 Muldis-DB distribution, and
    the first release of any distribution to contain Perl 5 modules named
    Muldis::DB::\w+.

    * This is the initial file manifest:

    * Initial code file versions are: DB.pm and AST.pm and Validator.pm and
    Example.pm and PhysType.pm and Operators.pm 0.0.0.

    * As of this release, Muldis-DB is officially in pre-alpha development
    status.  A lot of documentation and functionality is present, but a lot
    isn't.  What is mostly done is the higher level documentation plus an
    alpha-quality but fundamentally stable public API implementation.  What
    is mostly undone is the reference engine implementation, the test
    suite, and documentation of the API details.  What is already present
    should be sufficient to begin study of Muldis-DB such that it can
    actually be put to use within the next few weeks or months as Muldis-DB
    is fleshed out.  Also, it should be possible now to start writing code
    that uses or extends it.

2006-09-15 thru 2007-06-02

    * Started rewriting Rosetta again, but with a name change, since
    "Rosetta" was no longer appropriate for various reasons.  This rewrite
    took the intentionally bad and temporary name QDRDBMS, to be renamed
    again (to Muldis DB) later on.  With the name change allowed for the
    previous version numbering of Rosetta to be dropped, and this rewrite
    would eventually be first released as version zero.

    * Unlike both Rosetta incarnations, QDRDBMS started off explicitly
    having no external dependencies at all save Perl 5 or Perl 6 itself
    (and what they bundle), so this made it simpler yet in design, and in
    particular made it very easy to install (no dependency tree).

    * QDRDBMS was started in the wake of having had a lot more experience
    in reading up on the truly relational model of data, and was now
    designed fundamentally to be the design and implementation of a new
    turing complete programming language for working with relational
    databases, now called "QDRDBMS D".

    * QDRDBMS actually had a lot of code written for it this time, with the
    focus initially being to code first and document later, to experiment
    with what might work out.

    * Made an experimental CPAN release of QDRDBMS version 0.0.0 on
    2007-05-31, which specifically was a quick branch that stripped out all
    the code and just contained the documentation.  This was the only CPAN
    release of the (partial) project under the QDRDBMS name.

    * Shortly after this, QDRDBMS was renamed to its presumably final name
    of "Muldis DB", and its command language to "Muldis D".  But while
    "Muldis D" stuck, "Muldis DB" was fated for a further rename later.

2006-04-14 thru 2006-11-22

    * Started a complementary Perl 6 project named "Relation" which was
    intended to provide native tuple and relation data types for ordinary
    use in Perl 6 programs like other built-in collection types.  The first
    commit was Pugs SVN rev 9938, on 2006-04-14, and Pugs 6.2.12
    (2006-06-26) included it.

    * On 2006-07-04, renamed this project to "Set-Relation", which it
    remains to this day.  Pugs 6.2.13 and later included this.

    * Set-Relation received various small updates thru 2007-02-03, but is
    now stagnant; it will likely get un-stuck after Muldis Rosetta sets an
    example for it.

2006-02-01 thru 2006-04-13

    * The first simultaneous releases of the Perl 5 and 6 versions of
    Rosetta's rewrite occurred on 2006-02-01; they were also the first CPAN
    releases of either version.  The Perl 6 one was Pugs release 6.2.11
    (SVN rev 8934).

    * On 2006-02-23 was the first (Perl 5) CPAN release of Rosetta where
    the project was then officially an implementation of "The Third
    Manifesto", the central work of Darwen and Date's DBMS proposal;
    moreover, Rosetta's command language was named "Rosetta D", to be a "D"
    language by the terms of said proposal.

    * On 2006-03-20 was the (Perl 5) release that declared Rosetta was to
    be fundamentally a self-contained relational DBMS (and the core
    distribution would bundle such an implementation of its API) rather
    than "just" a DBMS wrapper; though extensions could still chose to
    operate as wrappers over other DBMSs.

    * On 2006-04-13 was the last CPAN release of the Perl 5 Rosetta, and
    Pugs 6.2.12 (SVN rev 10930), on 2006-06-26, had the corresponding Perl
    6 version; Pugs 6.2.13 (SVN rev 11402), on 2006-10-27, had the last
    CPAN release of Perl 6 Rosetta, with trivial Perl 6 only updates.
    After this, Pugs would have a Muldis Rosetta instead.

    * This time period also saw very little code, and almost entirely
    documentation updates.

    * However, the code that did exist at this time was trying so hard to
    be alike between Perl 5 and Perl 6 that the Perl 5 version had external
    dependencies on a half-dozen CPAN distros that provided features like
    Perl 6 builtins, but said features were largely trivial.  Both versions
    also went to trouble to make their user text (support) multi-lingual.

2005-12-06 thru 2006-01-31

    * Rosetta started to evolve so that its API and design was based on
    relational algebra, which is a lot of smaller generic constructs that
    can easily be arranged into queries; this is in contrast to the
    previous design based around monolithic and unwieldy SQL "select"
    queries.  Generally speaking, there was increasing influence on the
    design by Hugh Darwen's and Chris Date's proposals on how a truly
    relational DBMS should work.  This time period also saw very little
    code, and almost entirely documentation updates.

2005-12-05

    * Darren Duncan is introduced by David Wheeler to the truly relational
    model of data, in a posting on the Bricolage development list in the
    "Re: [6977] New branch for maintenance of Bricolage 1.10.x." thread.

    * David said that Darren's expressed thought, that compound data types
    in table fields was a violation of first normal form, was in fact a
    misconception about the relational model.  David then referenced a
    recent interview with C. J. Date.

    * This set off a chain of events which was the largest paradigm shift
    to ever affect the Rosetta project.  While the continuing goal of
    Rosetta remained largely the same, the way this was to be accomplished
    would become quite different, and the project would gain a new goal, to
    help improve the design of relational DBMSs themselves.

2005-09-30 thru 2005-12-04

    * Started a full rewrite of Rosetta, with the intent of avoiding being
    over-engineered, and cutting corners in the short term so to get
    something useable at all sooner.  The idea was to focus on vertical
    development first, so that at least a subset of features work earlier,
    taking the development strategy of Perl6-Pugs itself as an example;
    this is in contrast to the more horizontal development strategy of the
    first Rosetta implementation.

    * Moreover, this rewrite was being done simultaneously in both Perl 5
    and Perl 6; each language had its own independent but synchronized
    version, with the Perl 6 one intended to be the main future one that
    guided design decisions, and the Perl 5 one intended to be the one
    production-ready first, to be used until Perl 6 itself was production
    ready.  That co-development was maintained afterwards, and happens with
    the Muldis Rosetta core.

    * There was practically no code produced at this time, mainly just
    design documentation.

    * This Rosetta rewrite retained the version numbering of the previous
    line, and its numbers were a bit awkward as a result.

2002-11-12 thru 2005-09-28, plus 2006-01-13

    * Developed and released on CPAN the Rosetta DBMS framework, whose
    intended purpose was to provide rigorous portability of database
    schemas and database-using applications between different SQL DBMS
    products.  A lot of design documentation was produced, as well as some
    code and tests, but while a significant amount of executing code was
    produced, no solution emerged that was actually useable for real work;
    what did get produced was also unnecessarily complicated.

    * Throughout the life of that project, these various module namespaces
    were used for CPAN distributions of parts of the framework:

        - DBIx-Portable (2003-01-05)
        - Rosetta (2003-01-21 thru 2005-09-28, plus 2006-01-13)
        - SQL::ObjectModel (2003-06-11 thru 2003-09-16)
        - SQL::SyntaxModel (2003-09-26 thru 2004-09-13)
        - SQL::Routine (2004-10-04 thru 2005-09-28)

    * The "Rosetta" and "SQL-Routine" names were also registered with "The
    Perl 5 Module List", on 2003-01-21 and 2004-10-04, respectively.  Later
    on, the "SQL-Routine" registration was deleted on 2006-01-07, and the
    "Rosetta" registration on 2007-04-24.

    * A translation of some parts of Rosetta into Perl 6 was made, under
    the auspices of the Perl6-Pugs project, between 2005-03-25 (Pugs SVN
    rev 1194) and 2005-04-02 (Pugs SVN rev 1463); Pugs release 6.0.13
    (2005-03-26) included a version, but Pugs 6.0.14 (2005-04-04) did not;
    the Perl 6 versions didn't work, however, which is why they were soon
    excised from the Pugs VC (to P6PAN, which didn't go anywhere).

    * A Lightning Talk was also given introducing Rosetta at OSCON 2005;
    but it is Muldis Rosetta instead that will fulfill the promises made in
    it.

2002-06-07

    * Started writing self-contained code components that were explicitly
    designed to enable external code that used them to work seamlessly on
    multiple database products.  Some of this work was reused later in the
    Rosetta DBMS framework et al, and hence 2002 is the start of the
    declared copyright date range for Muldis Rosetta.
