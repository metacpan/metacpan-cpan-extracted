Revision history for p5-Palm (now the Palm distribution)

1.400  2015-03-14  Release by Christopher J. Madsen

	- Bump version number to be greater than all previous releases.
	  Palm::StdAppInfo 1.20 was released in p5-Palm 1.008, but
	  p5-Palm 1.009 contained Palm::StdAppInfo 1.009.  The other
	  modules had similar issues.  Version numbers shouldn't go backwards.
	  I'm jumping them to 1.400 to match Palm::PDB.
	  (reported by David Cantrell - Palm::PDB GitHub#1)

	  changes since November 2002 listed in this file.

1.005  2007-01-13  Release by brian d foy <bdfoy@cpan.org>

1.004  2004-04-15  Various Authors

 The release history before version 1.006 is muddled.
 These are the changes listed, but it's not clear what was released when.

 2004-04-15 21:21  christophe

	- Palm/PDB.pm, util/pdbdump: Added some logic to detect broken
	databases during loading:

	- database names _must_ contain the terminating NUL within the
	first 32 characters of the header. This catches obviously broken
	situations like text files renamed to .pdb files (which, oddly
	enough, happens a lot when you're trying to process text files into
	Doc files).

	- position offsets mustn't go beyond the end of the database file
	($pdb->{_size}).  This indicates either truncation of the db or
	straight corruption.

 2004-04-08 22:55  christophe

	can't be uploaded to the PDA, that's for sure.

 2002-05-09 10:33  arensb

	- Palm/Address.pm: More sanity checks, and a somewhat more elegant
	way of doing things (iterate over field names, rather than
	duplicating code a bunch of times).

 2002-05-09 10:24  arensb

	- Palm/StdAppInfo.pm: (bug fix) Used to do some sanity-checking,
	then ignored it. We now pay attention to our own sanity checks.

	- Makefile.PL: Bumped up patchlevel number.

 2000-09-16 19:58  arensb

	this module failed to parse some well-formed PDBs.

 2000-09-16 19:57  arensb

	- util/pdbdump: Oops! Forgot to fix resources.	Minor cleaning.

 2000-09-16 19:53  arensb

	there, 'pdbdump' failed to parse some well-formed PDBs.

 2000-09-09 00:52  arensb

	- Makefile.PL: Bumped up version number.

 2000-09-09 00:50  arensb

	- Palm/StdAppInfo.pm: Added $error variable.  (bug fix): A
	mis-written test would cause &pack_StdAppInfo to omit unnamed
	categories. Hence, the category list had fewer than 16 categories,
	when written.  Fixed typo.  (feature): Added &addCategory,
	&deleteCategory, &renameCategory.  Removed BUGS section.

 2000-09-08 22:48  arensb

	- Palm/StdAppInfo.pm: Stop Perl from complaining if there are
	unnamed categories.

 2000-09-08 22:47  arensb

	- Makefile.PL: Bumped up the version number.

 2000-08-28 23:19  arensb

	- Palm/StdAppInfo.pm: Changed API: the categories are new arranged
	as a 16-element array of category structs, the way they logically
	belong, rather than as disparate arrays, the way they're
	represented in the file.  Added a lot to the POD.

 2000-08-28 23:16  arensb

	- TODO: Removed an item.

 2000-08-28 23:16  arensb

	fields are undefined.

 2000-08-13 17:59  arensb

	- Palm/: Address.pm, Datebook.pm, Mail.pm, Memo.pm, ToDo.pm:
	Updated for new &parse_StdAppInfo behavior.

 2000-08-13 17:59  arensb

	- Palm/StdAppInfo.pm: (bug fix): &parse_StdAppInfo now puts the
	non-category part of the AppInfo block in $appinfo->{other}. This
	is so that a script that reads a random .pdb file as a StdAppInfo
	(and nothing else) can copy it without loss of data.
	&pack_StdAppInfo uses $appinfo->{other}.  Clarified documentation
	somewhat.

 2000-08-04 00:12  arensb

	- Palm/PDB.pm: Fixed expression that made 'perl5.6 -w' print a
	warning.

 2000-08-01 23:19  arensb

	- Palm/PDB.pm: (bug fix): Read and write files in binary mode under
	Windows, MS-DOS, and other OSes that make that distinction.

 2000-08-01 23:17  arensb

	&ParseRecord.

	- Makefile.PL: Bumped up version number.

 2000-07-19 00:00  arensb

	- TODO: Removed an item.

 2000-07-18 23:58  arensb

 2000-07-18 23:57  arensb

	- TODO: Added an item.

 2000-07-08 20:25  arensb

	- Palm/PDB.pm: PDB::new now initializes more fields.  PDB::Write
	prints a warning if writing a zero-length record.
	PDB::new_Resource: type now defaults to all NULs (instead of four
	spaces).

 2000-07-08 20:11  arensb

	- Palm/Datebook.pm: Changed a comment.

 2000-06-30 11:41  arensb

	- Makefile.PL: Bumped up version number.

	- TODO: Added an item.

 2000-06-30 11:41  arensb

	- Palm/Datebook.pm: Made AppInfo block initialization the same as
	other modules, even though Datebook doesn't really use categories
	and such.

 2000-06-30 11:40  arensb

	- Palm/StdAppInfo.pm: (bug fix): Use of anonymous array instead of
	a real array caused first category (and first category ID) to be a
	reference rather than a "real" scalar.

 2000-05-23 02:56  arensb

	- Makefile.PL: Incremented patchlevel number.

 2000-05-23 02:55  arensb

	- Palm/: Address.pm, Memo.pm: (bug fix): Don't run
	StdAppInfo::import(). This prevents StdAppInfo from registering
	itself as the default handler in generic tools.

	"sent_to").  Patch supplied by Sumant S.R. Oemrawsingh
	<sikander@stad.dsl.nl>

 2000-05-13 01:16  arensb

	- Makefile.PL: Incremented patch level.  Added "pdbdump" to the
	distribution.

 2000-05-13 01:15  arensb

	- MANIFEST: Ship "pdbdump" instead of "dumpdb".

 2000-05-13 01:15  arensb

	- util/dumpdb: Some obsolete refinements.

 2000-05-13 01:14  arensb

	- Palm/StdAppInfo.pm: Added an import() function, so you can say
	that a function is a Palm::StdAppInfo.

 2000-05-13 01:12  arensb

	- Palm/Mail.pm: (bug fix): Palm::Mail::new_Record() didn't return a
	value.	Don't import StdAppInfo, since don't want new PDBs to
	default to StdAppInfo.

 2000-05-08 05:48  arensb

	- util/pdbdump: Rewritten from scratch. This is basically just
	Palm/PDB.pm with trace statements.

	POD. Added &new, &new_Record methods.

 2000-02-01 23:18  arensb

	- Palm/Address.pm: Added placeholder for
	$pdb->{appinfo}{lastUniqueID}.

 2000-02-01 07:31  arensb

	- Palm/: Raw.pm, ToDo.pm: Added $VERSION variable, per CPAN.

 2000-02-01 07:31  arensb

	- Palm/PDB.pm: Renamed &deleteRecord to &delete_Record, for
	consistency.  &append_Record, &append_Resource, &delete_Record
	update PDB's mtime.

 2000-02-01 07:20  arensb

	- Palm/: Mail.pm, Memo.pm: Added $VERSION variable, per CPAN.

 2000-02-01 07:19  arensb

	- Palm/Address.pm: Added $VERSION to all .pm files, per CPAN.
	Moved pod documentation to be adjacent to the code, instead of at
	the end.  Fixed &new so there are always 16 categories, one of
	which is named "Unfiled" with code 0.

 2000-01-23 04:18  arensb

	- Palm/PDB.pm: The various _load_*() functions are no longer
	methods, since they shouldn't be overridden anyway.  Added
	documentation for new_Record(), append_Record(), new_Resource(),
	append_resource(), findRecordByID(), deleteRecord().

 2000-01-23 01:33  arensb

	- util/dumpdb: Bug fix: deal with PDBs without records, and PRCs
	without resources.  Memo: Dump() now prints the AppInfo and sort
	blocks, if they exist.	Address: Dump() now prints the field labels
	in the AppInfo block.  Address: print the record attributes.

 2000-01-23 01:28  arensb

	- Palm/PDB.pm: Updated copyright.  Fixed function cross-references
	in the documentation.  new() method now initializes the common
	fields.  Fiddled with quotes in the documentation some more.
	Write() method now supplies the two NULs if they're missing.  Added
	methods: new_Record(), append_Record(), new_Resource(),
	append_Resource(), findRecordByID(), deleteRecord().

 2000-01-23 01:24  arensb

	- Palm/Address.pm: Added new() method, to specifically create a new
	Address PDB.  Added new_Record() method, to create a new Address
	record.  Bug fix: PackAppInfoBlock() only packed whichever
	categories were defined. It now makes sure that it packs 16
	categories.

 2000-01-23 01:20  arensb

	- Makefile.PL: Incremented version.

 1999-12-05 23:11  arensb

	- util/dumpdb: Took out Bitmaps and DopeWars, since those aren't

	- MANIFEST: Added README.

 1999-11-18 03:24  arensb

	- test.pl: Generated by MakeMaker. Not used.

 1999-11-18 00:23  arensb

	- util/dumpdb: Added RCS comment.  Updated "use" statements to
	reflect the fact that the Palm stuff is in Palm::<foo>, not
	Palm::PDB::<foo>.

 1999-11-18 00:21  arensb
