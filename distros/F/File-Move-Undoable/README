NAME
    File::Move::Undoable - Move file/directory using rename/rsync, with undo
    support

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.09 of File::Move::Undoable (from Perl
    distribution File-Move-Undoable), released on 2017-07-10.

FUNCTIONS
  mv
    Usage:

     mv(%args) -> [status, msg, result, meta]

    Move file/directory using rename/rsync, with undo support.

    If moving to the same filesystem, will move using "rename()". On undo
    will restore the old name.

    If moving to a different filesystem, will copy to "target" using "rsync"
    and then trash "source". On undo, will trash "target" and restore
    "source" from trash.

    Fixed state: "source" does not exist and "target" exists. Content or
    sizes are not checked; only existence.

    Fixable state: "source" exists and "target" doesn't exist.

    Unfixable state: "source" does not exist, or both "source" and "target"
    exist (unless we are moving to a different filesystem, in which it means
    an interrupted transfer and thus fixable).

    This function is not exported.

    This function is idempotent (repeated invocations with same arguments
    has the same effect as single invocation). This function supports
    transactions.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   rsync_opts => *array[str]* (default: ["-a"])

        Rsync options.

        By default, "-a" is used. You should not use rsync options that
        modify or destroy source, like "--remove-source-files" as it will
        make recovery of interrupted move impossible.

    *   source* => *str*

    *   target* => *str*

        Target location.

        Note that to avoid ambiguity, you must specify full location instead
        of just directory name. For example: mv(source=>'/dir',
        target=>'/a') will move /dir to /a and mv(source=>'/dir',
        target=>'/a/dir') will move /dir to /a/dir.

    Special arguments:

    *   -tx_action => *str*

        For more information on transaction, see Rinci::Transaction.

    *   -tx_action_id => *str*

        For more information on transaction, see Rinci::Transaction.

    *   -tx_recovery => *str*

        For more information on transaction, see Rinci::Transaction.

    *   -tx_rollback => *str*

        For more information on transaction, see Rinci::Transaction.

    *   -tx_v => *str*

        For more information on transaction, see Rinci::Transaction.

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element (status) is an integer containing HTTP status code (200
    means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second element (msg) is
    a string containing error message, or 'OK' if status is 200. Third
    element (result) is optional, the actual result. Fourth element (meta)
    is called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information.

    Return value: (any)

FAQ
  Why do you use rsync? Why not, say, File::Copy::Recursive?
    With "rsync", we can continue interrupted transfer. We need this ability
    for recovery. Also, "rsync" can handle hardlinks and preservation of
    ownership, something which File::Copy::Recursive currently does not do.
    And, being implemented in C, it might be faster when processing large
    files/trees.
