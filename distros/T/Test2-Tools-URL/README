VERSION

    version 0.06

SYNOPSIS

     use Test2::V0;
     use Test2::Tools::URL;
     
     is(
       "http://example.com/path1/path2?query=1#fragment",
       url {
         url_scheme             => 'http';
         url_host               => 'example.com';
         url_component path     => '/path1/path2';
         url_component query    => { query => 1 };
         url_component fragment => 'fragment';
       },
       'url is as expected',
     );

DESCRIPTION

    This set of Test2 tools helps writing tests against URLs, represented
    as either strings, or as objects that stringify to URLs (such as URI or
    Mojo::URL).

    The idea is that you may be writing tests against URLs, but you may
    only care about one or two components, and you may not want to worry
    about decoding the URL or breaking the components up. The URL may be
    nested deeply. This tool is intended to help!

FUNCTIONS

 url

     my $check = url {}

    Checks that the given string or object is a valid URL.

 url_base

     url {
       url_base $url;
     };

    Use the given base URL for relative paths. If specified outside of a
    URL, then it will apply to all url checks.

 url_component

     url {
       url_component $component, $check;
     }

    Check that the given URL component matches.

    scheme

      Note: scheme is normalized to lower case for this test.

    authority

    userinfo

    hostport

    host

      Note: hostname is not normalized to lower case for this test. To test
      the normalized hostname use url_host below.

    port

    path

    query

      May be either a string, list or array!

    fragment

    user

      [version 0.06]

      Note: for ftp URLs only.

    password

      [version 0.06]

      Note: for ftp URLs only.

    media_type

      [version 0.06]

      Note: for data URLs only.

    data

      [version 0.06]

      Note: for data URLs only.

 url_scheme

    [version 0.06]

     url {
       url_scheme $check;
     }

    Check that the given URL scheme matches $check. Note that the scheme is
    normalized to lower case for this test, so it is identical to using
    url_component 'scheme', $check.

 url_host

    [version 0.06]

     url {
       url_host $check;
     }

    Check that the given URL host matches $check. Note that the host is
    normalized to lower case for this test, unlike the url_component
    'host', $check test described above.

 url_secure

    [version 0.06]

     url {
       url_secure();
     }

    Check that the given URL is using a secure protocol like https or wss.

 url_insecure

    [version 0.06]

     url {
       url_insecure();
     }

    Check that the given URL is using an insecure protocol like http or
    ftp.

 url_mail_to

    [version 0.06]

     url {
       url_mail_to $check;
     }

    Checks that the email address in the given mailto URL matches the
    check. For non-mailto URLs this check will fail.
