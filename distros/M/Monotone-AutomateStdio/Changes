Revision history for Perl extension Monotone::AutomateStdio.

1.10  Sat Apr 30 17:08:00 2016 Anthony Cooper <support@coosoft.plus.com>
	- Changes made for Monotone version 1.10:
	  - Added an erase_descendants() method.
	  - The get_attributes() method now accepts an additional revision id
	    when working outside of a workspace.
	  - Updated documentation.
	- The mtn_aif_version field inside the Monotone object now contains the
	  full floating point version number of the automate stdio interface
	  version.

1.03  Sat Sep 07 18:58:00 2013 Anthony Cooper <support@coosoft.plus.com>
	- Only prepend the database name with its full path when dealing with a
	  disk based database and not a memory based one as used when
	  connecting to remote databases.
	- Renamed the dn_name field to the correct db_name. This means that any
	  database names that are specified with a relative path correctly get
	  converted to their absolute path name.
	- All constructors now only honour <Class Name>->new() and not
	  <Object>->new() as well. This makes the code cleaner and is less
	  confusing to the caller as the object way of calling the constructor
	  could be misinterpreted as some sort of clone method (which it
	  isn't).
	- The workspace name is now correctly used when throwing an invalid
	  workspace exception.

1.02  Sat Jan 28 17:25:00 2012 Anthony Cooper <support@coosoft.plus.com>
	- The new_from_service() contructor now allows Monotone style URLs as
	  well as <host>[:<port>] server names.
	- Updated the documentation and corrected a few typos.

1.01  Sat Jul 2 18:00:00 2011 Anthony Cooper <support@coosoft.plus.com>
	- Removed tabs in the test script. Forgot to do this before.
	- Be less stringent about UTF-8 convertion failures.
	- Now quote versions. Helps with the automated distribution system.

1.00  Sun Apr 17 19:40:00 2011 Anthony Cooper <support@coosoft.plus.com>
	- For STRING_KEY_VALUE parsing I now pass the offset of the relevant RE
	  subexpression as an extra argument to get_quoted_value() rather than
	  the slicker but more hacky `local' approach taken before.
	- Reviewed the use of assorted string parsing tokens in the key hashes
	  so as to allow more multi-line quoted values.
	- Upped the version to 1.00. :-)
	- Got the library to work with mtn version 1.00, ran tests and updated
	  the test results file. Basically when parsing db variables one must
	  allow for multi-line values.
	- Changes made for ticket 137:
	  - Now periodically check to see if anything needs reading from mtn's
	    STDERR and if there is data then read it until there is no more.
	    This is to stop mtn grinding to a halt because it is blocking on a
	    write to STDERR.
	- Now switched for tabs in indentation to spaces. Seems to be the way
	  to go now. This has been checked in on its own as it is a massive
	  change to the code.
	- Updated the documentation to reflect versions supported and use of
	  SIGALRM.

0.12  Sun Feb 20 11:00:00 2011 Anthony Cooper <support@coosoft.plus.com>
	- Now always convert any database specified with a relative path into
	  an absolute path so that any subsequent chdir(2) call doesn't stop
	  the library from opening the specified database.
	- Now call the flush() method after writing out an automate stdio
	  command string when sending instructions to Monotone. This strictly
	  speaking is not necessary as print() and printf() flush on newline
	  but it is best to be explicit.
	- Now use the OO style calling convention for IO handle style objects
	  rather than the functional style that was used in some places.

0.11  Tue Jan 4 18:47:00 2011 Anthony Cooper <support@coosoft.plus.com>
	- Added the MTN_SELECTOR_OR_OPERATOR constant and the supporting
	  logic. Monotone now has an or `|' operator that I missed off when
	  doing the 0.99.1 development.

0.10  Thu Nov 27 18:47:00 2010 Anthony Cooper <support@coosoft.plus.com>
	- Made changes for 0.99.1 of Monotone, specifically:
	  - Added the checkout(), drop_public_key(),
	    get_extended_manifest_of(), get_file_size(), get_public_key(),
	    log() and put_public_key() methods.
	  - Renamed the genkey() method to generate_key() (the old name is now
	    aliased to the new one).
	  - The pull(), push() and sync() methods now support the --dry-run
	    option, output information in the form of structured records and
	    now only expect the URI style syntax for server end points.
	  - Mtn startup options have been updated in light of the CLI switches
	    revamp.
	- The parse_kv_record() routine now supports fields that occur multiple
	  times in an I/O stanza record. Also a new value type,
	  STRING_AND_HEX_ID, has now been added.
	- There are now no exceptions to using the parse_kv_record() routine
	  for processing I/O stanza style records.
	- Option parsing/expansion is now done in one place (inside the
	  expand_options() routine.
	- All birth fields are named birth as against birth_id.
	- New objects are now only created if a unique id can be found for them
	  first.
	- Updated the POD documentation for the changes made for Monotone
	  0.99.1.
	- Updated mtn-tester to cope with the new Monotone 0.99.1 changes.
	- Changed mtn-tester so that error messages returned by the
	  get_error_message() method only get displayed if they are different
	  from before (helps to minimise changes in the test output logs).
	- Reformatted my statements slightly so as to be more consistent with
	  other statements.
	- Upped the version number to 0.10.

0.09  Thu Aug 12 17:40:00 2010 Anthony Cooper <support@coosoft.plus.com>
	- Added support for Monotone version 0.48 by adding the update()
	  method.
	- Made the the code that reads format 2 chunk headers slightly more
	  efficient (avoids calling poll() more than it has to).
	- Now recognise development versions of Monotone.
	- Updated the documentation (and corrected a typo).
	- Updated mtn-tester for Monotone version 0.48 and now added code to
	  print out the return value from the get_error_message() method after
	  each test.

0.08  Sun May 23 10:00:00 2010 Anthony Cooper <support@coosoft.plus.com>
	- The get_db_name() method now returns undef instead of ":memory:" when
	  connecting to a network service.
	- Added the get_service_name() method.
	- Corrected a bug where retries on locked db caused exceptions to be
	  thrown in the startup routine despite the retry handler successfully
	  dealing with the situation and waiting until the db was unlocked.
	- Now stop deep recursion from happening in the above situation.
	- Improved the logic in error handling inside the startup routine so
	  that the best error message is generated.
	- Improved some exception messages and other minor code tidy-ups.
	- Updates the documentation and corrected a few typos.

0.07  Sat Feb 27 19:30:00 2010 Anthony Cooper <support@coosoft.plus.com>
	- Added support for 0.46:
	  - Added support for extracting the extra automate stdio data streams
	    new in 0.46.
	  - Added support for automate remote_stdio via the new_from_service()
	    contructor.
	  - Added the pull(), push() and sync() methods.
	- Updated the POD documentation.
	- Added a return statement to the end of all methods that don't return
	  anything so that nothing can be accidentally leaked (Perl subroutines
	  by default return the value of the last expression executed).
	- Now use the getlines() method instead of <>.
	- SIGPIPE is now ignored (caused the program to terminate when the mtn
	  subprocess exited unexpectedly and this library was in the middle of
	  sending it something).
	- Stopped using abbreviated words in error messages.
	- Rationalised the use of die() croaker() and carper() (some things
	  were carping when they should have been croaking).
	- Used the OO style of calling print() and printf() so that
	  $this->{mtn_in} could be used directly.
	- Short reads on reading data cause errors rather than a blocking read.
	- Restructured some code in mtn_command_with_options() to be more
	  logically grouped.
	- Failure to read the new format header does not obscure potentially
	  more helpful error messages.
	- Get more consistent results (WRT irrelevant Data::Dumper related
	  white space) if UTF-8 conversion is switched off.
	- Switched over to custom Inside Out object design.
	- The version numbers are not treated as floating point numbers.
	- Made the convertion from UTF-8 into Perl's internal string format
	  handle errors in a better way.
	- Made the handling of the convert_to_utf8 flag a little bit more
	  consistent with other such flags.
	- Some code tidy ups.
	- Added new tests for mtn version 0.46 and updated the test results
	  with the corresponding output.
	- Corrected some comments.

0.06  Sat Nov 07 15:27:00 2009 Anthony Cooper <support@coosoft.plus.com>
	- Updated library to take into account the changes made in Monotone
	  0.45. This also includes the documentation. Changes include:
	  - tags() and certs() now return a has as a key or signer rather than
	    their name.
	  - content_diff() now supports the --reverse and --with-headers
	    options.
	  - keys() now returns given_name and local_name instead of just name.
	- Tested against a 0.45 database and also updated the test harness to
	  reflect the above changes.
	- Made the exception handling code more consistent and cleaner.
	- Corrected the use of IO::Poll's mask method and added POLLHUP to the
	  mask.
	- Now much more explicit in handling the reaping of subprocesses and
	  much more robust in the face of a subprocess that won't die.
	- Now test for the presence of exceptions by using a simple boolean
	  test.
	- Now cope with open3() throwing exceptions whilst inside the child
	  process.
	- Now allow the --rcfile switch.
	- Made other small consistency tidy ups.

0.05  Fri Jun 05 17:49:00 2009 Anthony Cooper <support@coosoft.plus.com>
	- Updated for Monotone version 0.44:
	  - Added support for the w: selector (feature MTN_W_SELECTOR).
	  - Modified the genkey() and keys() methods to cope with the common
	    single hash as against separate private and public ones (feature
	    MTN_COMMON_KEY_HASH).
	- The type field has been dropped from the records returned by the
	  keys() method. It wasn't really needed as only one field is sometimes
	  not available.
	- Updated mtn-tester so as to reduce avoidable churn in the test output
	  and to also correctly deal with the data returned by the
	  get_revision() method.
	- Updated and tidied up the POD documentation to reflect the above
	  changes.
	- Now supports the conversion of UTF-8 data into and out of Perl's
	  internal UTF-8 string format for data read in from and sent out to
	  the mtn subprocess.
	- Added a suppress_utf8_conversion() method for disabling the above
	  conversion if so desired.

0.04  Sun May 03 19:19:00 2009 Anthony Cooper <support@coosoft.plus.com>
	- Updated for Monotone version 0.43, (added support for the m: and u:
	  selectors).
	- Corrected and simplified the `Have I got a class thingy as my first
	  argument?' logic in light of issues encountered when I tried to
	  derive from this class.
	- Updated the test harness in light of previous interface changes and
	  the fact that mtn revert is more noisy now (use the -quiet switch).
	- Updated the POD documentation.
	- Switched to the OO way of calling methods, more consistent.
	- Renamed the can() method to supports() so as not to conflict with
	  Perl's UNIVERSAL can() method.
	- Renamed some of the capability constants so as to fit in more
	  naturally with the method renamed above.

0.03  Sun Feb 08 18:22:00 2009 Anthony Cooper <support@coosoft.plus.com>
	- Switched all Perl scripts over to demanding Perl 5.8.5.
	- Improved an error message (which was causing compilation to fail
	  anyway).
	- Added the $mtn->switch_to_ws_root() class method.
	- Documented the above and under the NOTES section went into greater
	  detail the issues surrounding using mtn inside workspaces.
	- Changed the order of the Changes file (most recent first).
	- Clarified some POD file text.

0.02  Wed Jan 07 16:00:00 2009 Anthony Cooper <support@coosoft.plus.com>
	- Updated to work with Monotone version 0.42 (added the
	  $mtn->file_merge(), $mtn->lua() and $mtn->read_packets() methods and
	  added support for the --no-workspace mtn command line switch).
	- Added contributions and ideas from Thomas Keller:
	  - Now have two constructors new_from_db() and new_from_ws(). The
	    first is aliased to new() and does what the old constructor did.
	    The second constructor uses the details from the specified
	    workspace.
	  - The databases are checked to see if they are Monotone SQLite v3
	    databases before they are opened by the mtn subprocess.
	  - The get_ws_path() method has been added.
	  - The mtn subprocess is either started inside the root directory (if
	    no workspace is being used) or in the top level directory inside
	    the specified/current workspace. This helps avoid all sorts of
	    confusion and weirdness with the mtn subprocess.
	- Added the db_locked_condition_detected() method.
	- Now support the NULL key type in parse_kv_record to allow for cases
	  where there is a field key without a value.
	- Revamped all of the regexp string extraction code to be more
	  efficient.
	- The $io_stanza_re regular expression now also extras the key name.
	- Made an exception message more meaningful.
	- mtn-tester has been updated to test the new features and now
	  recreates the $mtn object after doing its initial tests so that any
	  error messages are cleared out prior to the actual tests.
	- Updated the documentation as a result of the new 0.42 features. I
	  have included a new EXAMPLES section, which details some of the less
	  obvious features, and an AUTHORS section. I have also revamped the
	  RETURN VALUE section to make it more readable).
