=head1 DESCRIPTION

Perl data type class for the XML Schema defined simpleType
ChangeStatus from the namespace https://adwords.google.com/api/adwords/ch/v201809.

An enum used to classify the types of changes that have been made to an adgroup/campaign during a specified date range. This only refers to the field of the entity itself, and not its children. <p>For example, if an AdGroup name changed, this status would be FIELDS_CHANGED, but if only bids on keywords belonging an AdGroup were changed this status would be FIELDS_UNCHANGED. 



This clase is derived from 
   SOAP::WSDL::XSD::Typelib::Builtin::string
. SOAP::WSDL's schema implementation does not validate data, so you can use it exactly
like it's base type.

# Description of restrictions not implemented yet.
