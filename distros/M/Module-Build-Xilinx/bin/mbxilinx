=head1 NAME

mbxilinx - Generate the Module::Xilinx::Build script by using YAML instead of
having to write Build.PL

=head1 VERSION

0.13

=head1 USAGE

 mbxilinx <build.yml>

=head1 THE YAML FILE

The YAML file required here may be titled B<build.yml> or could be anything
else. By default if you just run C<mbxilinx> without any arguments it will look
for C<build.yml> in the current directory or fail.

A sample C<build.yml> is present in the C<share/example> directory in the source
code which we shall reproduce here

The C<mbxilinx> program using the L<App::mbxilinx> module just parses the input
YAML file and then calls L<Module::Build::Xilinx> to create the C<Build> script
for use by the user as given in the L<Module::Build::Xilinx> documentation.
