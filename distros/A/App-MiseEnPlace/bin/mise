=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<mise> is a simple script that allows you to manage directory and symlink
creation based on a global config as well as per-project configs.

=head1 OPTIONS

The config file in the SYNOPSIS illustrates most of the available options.

=over 4

=item bindir

The directory to be used for the expansion of the keyword 'BIN' when creating
symlinks. (See below.) Defaults to C<$ENV{HOME}/bin>

=item manage

This is a list of directories in which to search for per-project config
files. Directories that don't start with a '/' are assumed to be relative to
$ENV{HOME} (i.e., 'foo' will be expanded to "$ENV{HOME}/foo"). Each line will
be globbed, so standard shell wildcards can be used.

This option is only valid in the "top-level" C<~/.mise> config file; it will
have to effect if placed in a per-project config.

=item create/directories

This is a list of directories to create. Directories that don't start with a
'/' are assumed to be relative to the directory containing the .mise
file. (I.e., C<foo> in a C<.mise> file located in C<$ENV{HOME}/my/proj/> will
be expanded to C<$ENV{HOME}/my/proj/foo>)

=item create/links

This is a list of symlinks to create, expressed as a series of source =>
target pairs. Both the source and target will be expanded relative to the
directory containing the C<.mise> file, as explained above for
create/directories. Additionally, if the target ends in a '/', the basename of
the source value will be appended (in much the same way the C<ln -s> works.)

Finally, there are a few keywords that can be used when creating links. If the
target consists solely of the keyword 'BIN', the link will be created in the
directory in the 'bindir' configuration variable, again using the basename of
the source. If the source consists solely of the keyword 'DIR', the link
source will be the directory containing the .mise file in question.

=head1 FLAGS

=over 4

=item C<--config/-C FILE>

Use a different config file

=item C<--remove-bin-links/-R>

Makes C<mise> remove any sylinks from the C<bindir> after doing directory
creation and before doing symlink creation.

=item C<--verbose/-v>

Makes C<mise> be very noisy about exactly what is going on.

=item C<--version/-V>

Displays the version number and exits
