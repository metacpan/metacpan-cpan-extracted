Mail/GnuPG version 0.15_1
=========================

Use GnuPG::Interface to process and/or create PGP signed or encrypted
email.

(See the inline documentation for more information)

This is a development release.  It works for me and at least four or five
other people.  It may not work for you.  If it doesn't, patches are
appreciated.

There is a known issue where some messages may not verify properly
because they use a fuzzy encoding like Quoted-Printable, and may
decode slightly differently in different places.

KNOWN ISSUES

 #2718 - https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=2718

  Mail::GnuPG assumes the signature is calculated on the decoded MIME
  data (which is the only thing it can get from MIME::Entity).  Jörn
  Reder is working on a solution.

TODO

- Get rid of 'cut' dependency.
- Consider nicer/prettier interface
- Use GnuPG::Interface's internal passphrase handling
- Add tests
- Use GnuPG::Handle->{direct} to pass files directly to gpg
