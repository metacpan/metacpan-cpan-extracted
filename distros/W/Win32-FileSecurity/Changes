	- support for building under Perl v5.6.0
	- support for passing Unicode strings to underlying Win32 calls

1.03  Fri Feb  6 20:57:24 1998
	- updated to base version 0.67 (fixes serious bugs)

	  suggested by Jutta Klebe <jmk@exc.bybyte.de>)

1.01  Sat Apr  5 14:23:42 1997
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.18
	- imported Activeware version

0.67 ALPHA 1997.07.07
	- Kludged bug in mapping bits to separate ACE's.  Notably,
	  this screwed up CHANGE access by leaving out a delete bit in
	  the INHERIT_ONLY_ACE | OBJECT_INHERIT_ACE Access Control
	  Entry.
	- May need to rethink...

0.66 ALPHA 1997.03.13
	- Fixed bug in memory allocation check

0.65 ALPHA 1997.02.25
	- Tested with 5.003 build 303
	- Added ISA exporter, and @EXPORT_OK
	- Added F, FULL, R, READ, C, CHANGE as composite pre-built mask names.
	- Added server\ to keys returned in hash from Get
	- Made constants and MakeMask case insensitive (I don't know why I did that)
	- Fixed mask comparison in ListDacl and Enumerate Rights from
	  simple & mask to exact bit match ! ( ( x & y ) ^ x ) makes
	  sure all bits in x are set in y
	- Fixed some "wild" pointers

0.60 ALPHA 1996.07.31
	- Now suitable for file and directory permissions
	- Included ListDacl.exe in bundle for debugging
	- Added "intuitive" inheritance for directories, basically
	  functions like FM triggered by presence of GENERIC_ rights
	  this may need to change
	- Changed from AddAccessAllowedAce to AddAce for control over inheritance

0.51 ALPHA 1996.07.20
	- Fixed memory allocation bug

0.50 ALPHA 1996.07.29
	- Base functionality
	- Using AddAccessAllowedAce
