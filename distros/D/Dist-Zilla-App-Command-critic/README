Dist::Zilla::App::Command::critic

"critic" is an "App::Command" for "Dist::Zilla" which streamlines
running "Perl::Critic" on your built distribution.

This competes with the likes of "[Test::Perl::Critic]" by:

*   not requiring the rest of the steps in the test life-cycle to
    execute.

*   not being impeded by the other tests cluttering your output.

*   not suffering the limitations of "Test::Perl::Critic" which discards
    profile color settings.

*   carefully formatting output to give a clearer visualization of where
    failures lie.

*   not requiring your dist have a "Test::Perl::Critic" test pass for
    release.

*   not requiring your dist to have any explicit "Perl::Critic"
    consumption.

Behaviorally:

  dzil critic

Behaves very similar to:

   dzil run --no-build perlcritic -p perlcritic.rc lib/

Except with improved verbosity of file name reporting.
