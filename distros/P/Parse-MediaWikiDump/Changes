	  come through as undefined.

0.30	December 23, 2005
	* the Pages and Links class now both use a method named next() to get
 	  the next record. The old link() and page() methods are retained for
	  now but should be migrated away from as soon as is convenient.

	* Solved a bug: Expat's current_byte method returns a 32 bit
	  signed integer and the english Wikipedia dumps cause the number to
          wrap; implemented a work around for this.

	* Improve testing of Parse::MediaWikiDump::Pages
	* Fix silly bug related to opening file handle references
	* Found new bug: The links dump format has been changed and the
