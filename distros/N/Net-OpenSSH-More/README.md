Net::OpenSSH::More
==================
A submodule of Net::OpenSSH focused on giving you some more tools
for executing common usage patterns of the (quite useful) parent
module, but which are basically left "as an exercise for the reader"
in the parent's POD.

See module POD for more details, and HAPPY HACKING!
