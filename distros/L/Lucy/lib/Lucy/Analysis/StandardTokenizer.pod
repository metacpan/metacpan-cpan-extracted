=head1 NAME

Lucy::Analysis::StandardTokenizer - Split a string into tokens.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $tokenizer = Lucy::Analysis::StandardTokenizer->new;

    # Then... once you have a tokenizer, put it into a PolyAnalyzer:
    my $polyanalyzer = Lucy::Analysis::PolyAnalyzer->new(
        analyzers => [ $tokenizer, $normalizer, $stemmer ], );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Generically, “tokenizing” is a process of breaking up a string into an
array of “tokens”.  For instance, the string “three blind mice” might be
tokenized into “three”, “blind”, “mice”.

Lucy::Analysis::StandardTokenizer breaks up the text at the word
boundaries defined in Unicode Standard Annex #29. It then returns those
words that contain alphabetic or numeric characters.

=head1 CONSTRUCTORS

=head2 new

    my $tokenizer = Lucy::Analysis::StandardTokenizer->new;

Constructor.  Takes no arguments.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 transform

    my $inversion = $standard_tokenizer->transform($inversion);

Take a single L<Inversion|Lucy::Analysis::Inversion> as input
and returns an Inversion, either the same one (presumably transformed
in some way), or a new one.

=over

=item *

B<inversion> - An inversion.
