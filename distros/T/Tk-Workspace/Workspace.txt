DESCRIPTION
    Workspace uses a modified Tk::Text widget to create an embedded Perl
    text editor. The resulting file can be run as a standalone program.

OPTIONS
    In normal use, common X toolkit options apply to non-text areas, like
    the window border and menus. Text resources can also be specified, but
    they often have a lower priority than the Workspace's saved values and
    user selections. Refer to the section: X RESOURCES, below.

    Command line options are described more fully in the Tk::CmdLine manual
    page.

  X Toolkit Options

    -foreground | -fg <color>
        Foreground color of widgets. -fg is a synonym for -foreground.

    -background | -bg <color>
        Background color of widgets. -bg is a synonym for -background.

    -class <classname>
        Name of X Window resource class. In normal use, this is overriden by
        the Workspace name.

    -display | -screen <displayname>
        Name of X display. -screen is a synonym for -display.

    -font | -fn <fontname>
        Font descriptor for widgets. -fn is a synonym for -font.

    -iconic
        Start with the window iconfied.

    -motif
        Adhere as closely as possible to Motif look-and-feel standards.

    -name <resourcename>
        Specifies the name under which X resources can be found. Refer to
        the section: X RESOURCES, below.

    -synchronous
        Requests should be sent to the X server synchronously. Mainly useful
        for debugging.

    -title <windowtitle>
        Title of the window. This is overridden by the Workspace.

    -xrm <resourcestring>
        Specifies a resource pattern to override defaults. Refer to the
        section: X RESOURCES, below.

  Workspace Specific Options

    -textforeground <color>
        Set the color of the text foreground. Overrides the Workspace's own
        setting.

    -textbackground <color>
        Set the color of the text background. Overrides the Workspace's own
        setting.

    -importfile <filename>
        At startup, import <filename> into the workspace at the cursor
        position.

    -exportfile <filename>
        Export the text of the workspace to <filename>.

    -title <workspacename>
        Set the window title and workspace name.

    -write
        Save the workspace in its current state. If the window is not yet
        drawn, use the default geometry of 565x351+100+100 and insertion
        cursor index of 1.0.

    -dump
        Print the Workspace text to standard output.

    -quit
        Close the Workspace without saving.

X RESOURCES
    In normal use, a workspace's Xresources begin with its name in
    lower-case letters.

      myworkspace*borderwidth:       3
      myworkspace*relief:            sunken
      myworkspace*takefocus:         true

    Top-level options are described in the Tk::Toplevel and Tk::options
    manual pages.

    In addition, several subwidgets have standard names, so properties can
    easily apply to all Workspaces:

          Widget             Resource Name
          ------             -------------
          Text Editor        workspaceText
          Menu Bar Menus     workspaceMenuBar
          Popup Menus        workspacePopupMenu

    Examples of resource settings that apply to all Workspaces:

      *workspaceText*insertwidth:         5
      *workspaceText*spacing1:            20
      *workspaceMenuBar*foreground:       white
      *workspaceMenuBar*background:       darkslategray
      *workspacePopupMenu*foreground:     white
      *workspacePopupMenu*background:     mediumgray

    Complete descriptions of the options that each widget recognizes are
    given in the Tk::Text, Tk::TextUndo, and Tk::Menu manual pages.

MENU FUNCTIONS
    A workspace contains a menu bar with File, Edit, Options, and Help
    menus.

    The menus also pop up by pressing the right mouse button (Button-3) over
    the text area, whether the menu bar is visible or not.

    The menu functions are provided by the Tk::Workspace, Tk::TextUndo,
    Tk::Text, and Tk::Widget modules.

  File Menu

    Import Text -- Insert the contents of a selected text file at the
    insertion point.

    Export Text -- Write the contents of the workspace to a text file.

    The Import and Export Text functions allow saving to files on remote
    hosts using FTP, if the Perl Net::FTP module is installed. Please refer
    to the file INSTALL in the distribution archive and the
    Tk::RemoteFileSelect manual page.

    System Command -- Prompts for the name of a command to be executed by
    the shell, /bin/sh. The output is inserted into the workspace.

    For example, to insert a manual page into the workspace, enter:

       man <programname> | colcrt - | col -b

    Shell -- Starts an interactive shell. The prompt is the PS1 prompt of
    the environment where the workspace was started. At present the
    workspace shell recognizes only a subset of the bash prompt variables,
    and does not implement command history or setting of environment
    variables in the subshell.

    Due to I/O blocking, results can be unpredictable, especially if the
    called program causes an eof condition on STDERR. For details refer to
    the Tk::Shell POD documentation.

    Refer to the bash(1) manual page for further information.

    Typing 'exit' leaves the shell and returns the workspace to normal text
    editing mode.

    Filter -- Specify a filter and output destination for the text in the
    Workspace. A ``filter'' is defined as a program that takes its input
    from standard input, STDIN, and sends its output to standard output,
    STDOUT. By default, output is inserted into the Workspace at the cursor
    position. Other destinations are:

      - File--Write output to the file name specified.
      - Terminal--Write output to the Workspace's STDOUT or to a
        character device specified as the output file.
      - New Workspace--Write output to a new Workspace with the
        name specified.

    If the Perl Net::FTP module is installed, filter output can be sent to a
    remote host, using the pathname syntax, hostname:/filepathname .

    Save -- Save the workspace to disk.

    Quit -- Close the workspace window, optionally saving to disk.

    Workspaces are saved with file mode permissions 0700 (read, write, and
    execute for the owner of the file).

  Edit Menu

    Undo -- Reverse the next previous change to the text.

    Cut -- Delete the selected text and place it on the X clipboard.

    Copy -- Copy the selected text to the X clipboard.

    Paste -- Insert text from the X clipboard at the insertion point.

    Evaluate Selection -- Interpret the selected text as Perl code.

    Search & Replace -- Open a dialog box to enter search and/or replace
    strings. Users can select options for exact upper/lower case matching,
    regular expression searches, forward or backward searches, and no query
    on replace. If "Replace without Asking" is selected, then all search
    matches will be replaced. The default is to prompt before the
    replacement. Replacements for regular expression matches are not
    supported.

    Goto Line -- Go to the line entered by the user.

    Which Line -- Report the line and column position of the insertion
    point.

  Options Menu

    Wrap -- Select how the text should wrap at the right margin.

    Scroll Bars -- Select from scroll bars at right or left, top or bottom
    of the text area.

    Encoding -- Select the encoding to use when exporting text. Does not
    affect the Workspace text itself. When importing, the text is mapped
    into ISO-8859-1, regardless of encoding. This option is only available
    if the UTF16 libraries are installed on the system. If they aren't, then
    the Workspace uses the default ISO 8859-1 encoding. Refer to the file
    INSTALL in the distribution archive for information about the required
    libraries.

    Show/Hide Menubar -- Toggle whether the menubar is visible. A popup
    version of the menus is always available by pressing the right mouse
    button (Button 3) over the text area.

    Color Editor -- Pops up a Color Editor window. You can select the text
    attribute that you want to change from the Colors -> Color Attributes
    menu. If your system libraries have an rgb.txt file, a list of the
    available colors is displayed on the left-hand side of the window.
    Double-clicking on a color name, or selecting its color space parameters
    from the sliders in the middle of the ColorEditor, displays that color
    in the swatch on the right-hand side of the window. Pressing the
    Apply... button at the bottom of the Color Editor applies the color
    selection to the text. The most useful attributes for Workspace text are
    foreground, background, and insertBackground.

    Text Font -- Select text font from list of system fonts.

  Help Menu

    About -- Report name of workspace and modification time, and version of
    Workspace.pm library.

    Help -- Display the Workspace.pm POD documentation in a text window
    formatted by pod2text.
