Revision history for Dist-Mgr

1.00    2020-12-30
    - Fix issue where ABSTRACT was being pulled from one of the test
      modules. We now pull it from the proper POD file (fixes #4)
    - t/20-ci_config_files.t no longer overwrites this distribution's
      production CI config file (fixes #3)
    - Commented out package statement in test module template so it doesn't
      get indexed on the CPAN (fixes #7)

      Acme-STEVEB and Acme-STEVEB
    - We now send in all of the proper variables to the module template
      (fixes #11)
    - Renamed _makefile_load() and _module_load() to _makefile_tie() and
      _module_tie(), which are by far more appropriate names
    - CI config now installs ExtUtils::MakeMaker to a recent version,
      fixing an issue where prereqs weren't being installed (fixes #9)

      (fixes #10)

      macos-latest, with coveralls.io support (closes #12)

    - We now croak() if the new version sent into version_bump() is less
