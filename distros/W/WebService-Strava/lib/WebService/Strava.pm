=head2 upload_activity

  $strava->upload_activity(
    file => '/path/to/sample.gpx', 
    type => 'gpx'
  );

Uploads an activity to Strava. Returns an upload status hash. Takes
the following named arguments: 

=over

=item file

Expected to be a path to the file being uploaded.

=item type

The Strava api accepts following file types:  fit, fit.gz, tcx, 
tcx.gz, gpx and  gpx.gz. There is no current logic to detect what 
sort is being uploaded (patches welcome), so you will need to set 
it which ever file your uploading. ie 'gpx' for a GPX file.

=item activity_type

Optional, case insensitive string of following types (list may be 
out of date check L<http://strava.github.io/api/v3/uploads/#post-file> 
for up to date info): ride, run, swim, workout, hike, walk, 
nordicski, alpineski, backcountryski, iceskate, inlineskate, kitesurf, 
rollerski, windsurf, workout, snowboard, snowshoe. Type detected from 
file overrides, uses athlete’s default type if not specified.

=item name

Optional string, if not provided, will be populated using start date 
and location, if available.

=item description

Optional. Left blank if not provided.

=item private

Sets the Activity to Private.

=item trainer

Optional integer, activities without lat/lng info in the file are 
auto marked as stationary, set to 1 to force.

=item external_id

Optional string, data filename will be used by default but should 
be a unique identifier.

=back

=head2 upload_status

  $strava->upload_status(id => '12345678');

Given an upload id (returned by uploading an activity) you can check 
the status of the request. Takes between 5 and 10 seconds for an 
to be processed so keep in mind  there isn't any point in checking 
more than once per second.

=head2 delete_activity

  $strava->delete_activity(id => '12345678');

Will delete a given activity. Returns true on success and false 
upon failure
