Arithmetic-PaperAndPencil

Arithmetic::PaperAndPencil  is a  module which  allows simulating  the
paper  and  pencil  techniques  for  basic  arithmetic  operations  on
integers: addition, subtraction, multiplication and division, but also
square root extraction and conversion from a radix to another.

Actually, this module is the porting of a similarly-named Raku module.
