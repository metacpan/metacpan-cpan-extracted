    this module.

DESCRIPTION
FUNCTIONS
  complete_arg_elem
    Usage:

     complete_arg_elem(%args) -> array

    Given argument name and function metadata, complete array element.

    Will attempt to complete using the completion routine specified in the
    argument specification (the "completion" property, or in the case of
    "complete_arg_elem" function, the "element_completion" property), or if
    that is not specified, from argument's schema using
    "complete_from_schema".

    Completion routine will get %args, with the following keys:

    *   "word" (str, the word to be completed)

    *   "arg" (str, the argument name which value is currently being
        completed)

    *   "index (int, only for the"complete_arg_elem` function, the index in
        the argument array that is currently being completed, starts from 0)

    *   "args" (hash, the argument hash to the function, so far)

    as well as extra keys from "extras" (but these won't overwrite the above
    standard keys).

    Completion routine should return a completion answer structure
    (described in Complete) which is either a hash or an array. The simplest
    form of answer is just to return an array of strings. Completion routine
    can also return undef to express declination.

    This function is not exported by default, but exportable.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   arg* => *str*

        Argument name.

    *   args => *hash*

        Collected arguments so far, will be passed to completion routines.

    *   extras => *hash*

        Add extra arguments to completion routine.

        The keys from this "extras" hash will be merged into the final %args
        passed to completion routines. Note that standard keys like "word",
        "cword", and so on as described in the function description will not
        be overwritten by this.

    *   index => *str*

        Index of element to complete.

    *   meta* => *hash*

        Rinci function metadata, must be normalized.

    *   riap_client => *obj*

        Optional, to perform complete_arg_val to the server.

        When the argument spec in the Rinci metadata contains "completion"
        key, this means there is custom completion code for that argument.
        However, if retrieved from a remote server, sometimes the
        "completion" key no longer contains the code (it has been cleansed
        into a string). Moreover, the completion code needs to run on the
        server.

        If supplied this argument and te "riap_server_url" argument, the
        function will try to request to the server (via Riap request
        "complete_arg_val"). Otherwise, the function will just give
        up/decline completing.

    *   riap_server_url => *str*

        Optional, to perform complete_arg_val to the server.

        See the "riap_client" argument.

    *   riap_uri => *str*

        Optional, to perform complete_arg_val to the server.

        See the "riap_client" argument.

    *   word => *str* (default: "")

        Word to be completed.

    Return value: (array)

  complete_arg_index
    Usage:

     complete_arg_index(%args) -> array

    Given argument name and function metadata, complete arg element index.

    This is only relevant for arguments which have "index_completion"
    property set (currently only "hash" type arguments). When that property
    is not set, will simply return undef.

    Completion routine will get %args, with the following keys:

    *   "word" (str, the word to be completed)

    *   "arg" (str, the argument name which value is currently being
        completed)

    *   "args" (hash, the argument hash to the function, so far)

    as well as extra keys from "extras" (but these won't overwrite the above
    standard keys).

    Completion routine should return a completion answer structure
    (described in Complete) which is either a hash or an array. The simplest
    form of answer is just to return an array of strings. Completion routine
    can also return undef to express declination.

        passed to completion routines. Note that standard keys like "word",
        "cword", and so on as described in the function description will not
        be overwritten by this.

    Return value: (array)

  complete_arg_val
    Usage:

     complete_arg_val(%args) -> array

    Given argument name and function metadata, complete value.

    Will attempt to complete using the completion routine specified in the
    argument specification (the "completion" property, or in the case of
    "complete_arg_elem" function, the "element_completion" property), or if
    that is not specified, from argument's schema using

    *   meta* => *hash*

        Rinci function metadata, must be normalized.

    *   riap_client => *obj*

    Return value: (array)

  complete_cli_arg
    Usage:

     complete_cli_arg(%args) -> hash

    Complete command-line argument using Rinci function metadata.

    This routine uses Perinci::Sub::GetArgs::Argv to generate Getopt::Long
    specification from arguments list in Rinci function metadata and common
    options. Then, it will use Complete::Getopt::Long to complete option
    names, option values, as well as arguments.

    This function is not exported by default, but exportable.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   common_opts => *hash*

        Common options.

        A hash where the values are hashes containing these keys: "getopt"
        (Getopt::Long option specification), "handler" (Getopt::Long
        handler). Will be passed to "get_args_from_argv()". Example:

         {
             help => {
                 getopt  => 'help|h|?',
                 handler => sub { ... },
                 summary => 'Display help and exit',
             },
             version => {
                 getopt  => 'version|v',
                 handler => sub { ... },
                 summary => 'Display version and exit',
             },
         }

    *   completion => *code*

        Supply custom completion routine.

        If supplied, instead of the default completion routine, this code
        will be called instead. Will receive all arguments that
        Complete::Getopt::Long will pass, and additionally:

        *   "arg" (str, the name of function argument)

        *   "args" (hash, the function arguments formed so far)

        *   "index" (int, if completing argument element value)

    *   cword* => *int*

        On which argument cursor is located (zero-based).

    *   extras => *hash*

        Add extra arguments to completion routine.

        The keys from this "extras" hash will be merged into the final %args
        passed to completion routines. Note that standard keys like "word",
        "cword", and so on as described in the function description will not
        be overwritten by this.

    *   func_arg_starts_at => *int* (default: 0)

        This is a (temporary?) workaround for Perinci::CmdLine. In an
        application with subcommands (e.g. "cmd --verbose subcmd arg0 arg1
        ..."), then "words" will still contain the subcommand name.
        Positional function arguments then start at 1 not 0. This option
        allows offsetting function arguments.

    *   meta* => *hash*

        Rinci function metadata.

    *   per_arg_json => *bool*

        Will be passed to Perinci::Sub::GetArgs::Argv.

    *   per_arg_yaml => *bool*

        Will be passed to Perinci::Sub::GetArgs::Argv.

    *   riap_client => *obj*

        Optional, to perform complete_arg_val to the server.

        When the argument spec in the Rinci metadata contains "completion"
        key, this means there is custom completion code for that argument.
        However, if retrieved from a remote server, sometimes the
        "completion" key no longer contains the code (it has been cleansed
        into a string). Moreover, the completion code needs to run on the
        server.

        If supplied this argument and te "riap_server_url" argument, the
        function will try to request to the server (via Riap request
        "complete_arg_val"). Otherwise, the function will just give
        up/decline completing.

    *   riap_server_url => *str*

        Optional, to perform complete_arg_val to the server.

        See the "riap_client" argument.

    *   riap_uri => *str*

        Optional, to perform complete_arg_val to the server.

        See the "riap_client" argument.

    *   words* => *array[str]*

        Command-line arguments.

    Return value: (hash)

    You can use "format_completion" function in Complete::Bash module to
    format the result of this function for bash.

  complete_from_schema
    Usage:

     complete_from_schema(%args) -> [status, msg, payload, meta]

    Complete a value from schema.

    Employ some heuristics to complete a value from Sah schema. For example,
    if schema is "[str => in => [qw/new open resolved rejected/]]", then we
    can complete from the "in" clause. Or for something like "[int =>
    between => [1, 20]]" we can complete using values from 1 to 20.

    This function is not exported by default, but exportable.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   schema* => *any*

        Must be normalized.

    *   word* => *str* (default: "")

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element (status) is an integer containing HTTP status code (200
    means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second element (msg) is
    a string containing error message, or 'OK' if status is 200. Third
    element (payload) is optional, the actual result. Fourth element (meta)
    is called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information.

    Return value: (any)
