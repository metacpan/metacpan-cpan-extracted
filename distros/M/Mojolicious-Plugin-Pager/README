DESCRIPTION
    Mojolicious::Plugin::Pager is a Mojolicious plugin for creating paged
    navigation, without getting in the way. There are other plugins which
    ship with complete markup, but this is often not the markup that *you*
    want.

    Note that this plugin is currently EXPERIMENTAL.

HELPERS
  pager_link
      $bytestream = $c->pager_link(\%page, @args);
      $bytestream = $c->pager_link(\%page, @args, sub { int(rand 100) });

    Takes a %page hash and creates an anchor using "link_to" in
    Mojolicious::Controller. @args is passed on, without modification, to
    "link_to()". The anchor generated has some classes added.

    See "pages_for" for detail about %page.

    Examples output:

      <a href="?page=2" class="prev" rel="prev">12</a>
      <a href="?page=1" class="first">1</a>
      <a href="?page=2" class="page">2</a>
      <a href="?page=3" class="active">3</a>
      <a href="?page=4" class="page">4</a>
      <a href="?page=5" class="page">5</a>
      <a href="?page=6" class="last">6</a>
      <a href="?page=3" class="next" rel="next">3</a>

  pages_for
      @pages = $self->pages_for($total_pages);

    Returns a list of %page hash-refs, that can be passed on to
    "pager_link".

    Example %page:

      {
        n       => 2,    # page number
        current => 1,    # if page number matches "page" query parameter
        first   => 1,    # if this is the first page
        last    => 1,    # if this is the last page
        next    => 1,    # if this is last, that brings you to the next page
        prev    => 1,    # if this is first, that brings you to the previous page
      }
