CONSTRUCTOR
  new
    Create a WWW::LibraryThing::Covers object with the following parameters:

    api_key
        Your LibraryThing API key (required).

    directory
        Output directory for the cover images.

    size
        Default size for cover images (optional, defaults to medium).
        Possible values are large, medium and small.

    not_found
        Defines behaviour for cover images not available. LibraryThing
        returns a transparent 1×1 pixel GIF image.

    delay
        Delay between requests. Defaults to 1 second as this is required for
        automatic downloads.

    user_agent
        LWP::UserAgent object (optional).

METHODS
  get
    Retrieves an image for given isbn and size (optional).

    The image is stored as ISBN.jpg in the directory provided to the
    constructor or just returned as scalar reference otherwise.

    The actual return value in case of success is a list with three members:

    *   Filename or scalar reference of the image data.

    *   Image width.

    *   Image size.

    Returns undef in case of errors.

    Returns 0 if constructor parameter not_found is set to return_zero and
    cover image is not available.
