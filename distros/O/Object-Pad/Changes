        [BUGFIXES]
         * Generate the constructor as an XSUB so we can find the superclass
           for derived subclasses better and avoid an infinite recusion loop
           on double-subclassing.

0.06    2019-10-23

         * Croak on attempts to invoke methods on non-instances, non-derived
           classes, etc...
         * Support perls back to 5.16 by various trickery
         * Store array and hash slot variables via RV so the instances are
           well-behaved as perl data structures
