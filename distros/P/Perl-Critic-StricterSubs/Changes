0.08 2024-10-21

    Minimum Perl version is now 5.10.1, the same as Perl::Critic itself.

    [Enhancments]
    RequireExplicitInclusion no longer will throw a warning on STDIN,
    STDOUT and STDERR, such as with STDOUT->autoflush. (GH #21)

0.07 2024-09-30

    [Enhancements]
    * ProhibitCallsToUndeclaredSubs did not know that functions like
      flock and seek and opendir took filehandles or readhandles, so would
      give false positives. (GH#15)

    * Added configuration to Modules::RequireExplicitInclusion to specify
      modules to ignore for violations.

    [Enhancements]
    * Modules::RequireExplicitInclusion: Disambiguated package names,
      such as Foo::Bar:: instead of just Foo::Bar, are now OK.
      Thanks, Olaf Alders and Klaus S. Madsen.

    * Modules::RequireExplicitInclusion: Add "utf8" to the list of
      built-in modules that don't require "use".  Thanks, Klaus S. Madsen.

    * Fixed RT #43314 and 44609. Modules::RequireExplicitInclusion now
      allows __PACKAGE__->foo().

0.03 2008-01-10

     [Bug Fixes]
     Fixed test failures due to incompatibility with newer
     PPI versions.  This distro now requires PPI 1.2 vis-a-vi
     Perl-Critic 1.080.  Thanks cpantesters!

0.02 2007-07-01

     [Enhancements]
     * ProhibitCallsToUndeclaredSubs is now configurable to exempt specific
       packages and subroutines.  See docs for details.

     * Added support for blocks-of-constants in ProhibitCallsToUndeclaredSubs.
       For example: use constant {FOO => 1, BAR => 2);

     * RequireExplicitInclusion now considers all "include" statements.  So
       a conditional or lexical "require" will now satisfy the policy, even
       if that condition is never satisfied during run-time, or the package
       is included in the wrong scope.

     * Refactored common code into the StricterSubs::Utils module.

     * Eliminated certain flavors of false-positives in several Policies.

     * Improved caching gives performance boost when analyzing many files.

     * Documented diagnostic messages.

     * Now requires Perl-Critic-1.052+
