1 SVN::S4
*********

This is the SVN::S4 Perl Package.

1.1 Copyright
=============

This package is Copyright 2006-2017 by Bryce Denney and Wilson Snyder
<wsnyder@wsnyder.org>.

   This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
it under the terms of either the GNU Lesser General Public License

entirely at your own risk.

1.2 Description
===============

This package adds additional Subversion support commands, similar to the
P4::C4 package.  These commands let you apply .cvsignore or .gitignore
files, snapshot areas and cleanup ignored files.  You can also create
views that consist of different repository areas, and deal with them as
if it was a larger checkout.

1.3 Obtaining Distribution
==========================

The latest version is available at <http://www.perl.org/CPAN/>

   Download the latest package from that site, and decompress.  'gunzip
SVN-S4_version.tar.gz ; tar xvf SVN-S4_version.tar'

1.4 Known Bugs
==============

SVN::S4 viewspecs rely on some obscure features of Subversion, in that
s4 needs to modify the .svn directory to create empty directories and
svn externals that switch to them.  This may require patching to work
when new versions of Subversion are released.  Other features should
work with all versions of Subverion.

1.5 Supported Systems
=====================

This version of SVN::S4 has been built and tested on:

   * i386-linux

   It should run on any Unix system with appropriate releases of
Subversion (see above).  Minor porting may be required for Windows
systems.
