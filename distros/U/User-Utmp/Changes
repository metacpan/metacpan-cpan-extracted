	- original version; created by h2xs 1.18

0.02  Mon Mar 22 20:32:24 UTC 1999

1.00  Sun Feb 27 17:15:30 UTC 2000

1.01  Sat May  6 16:36:55 UTC 2000

	- unset OPTIMIZE in Linux hint file (workaround for what looks
	  like a Linux bug)

1.5   Sun Sep 16 21:18:43 UTC 2001
	- in ut_addr, addresses containing NULL bytes (e.g.,
	  127.0.0.1) were truncated
	- unlike utmp ut_addr, utmpx ut_addr was not converted to a
	  string (but the documentation claimed it was)
	- reworked example.pl
	- added test for utmpx to test.pl
	- some editing of the documentation
	- some minor changes due to moving from CVS to PRCS; the PRCS
	  project version is now used as release version

1.6	Mon Sep 17 15:10:23 UTC 2001
	- EMPTY is no longer unconditionally defined in Linux hint
	  file (it wasn't defined on older Linux versions); if
	  necessary it's defined in Utmp.xs
	- tests should be more robust

1.7	Tue Sep 20 10:12:03 UTC 2005
	- In Utmp.xs, the tv_usec field was assigned the value of tv_sec

1.8	Sun Mar 26 23:42:44 UTC 2006
	- For compatibility with utmp, the utmpx read functions
	  generate a ut_time field; it can also be specified in the
	  argument to pututxline()
	- Added support for NetBSD (hints file and various #ifdefs)
	- Added Perl interfaces for all functions defined in the
	  Single UNIX Specification Version 3 (namely: endutxent(),
	  getutxent(), getutxid(), getutxline(), pututxline(), and
	  setutxent())
	- Extended documentation; it now also says that utmpx is
	  preferred
	- Enhanced test.pl
