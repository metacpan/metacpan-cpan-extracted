NAME

    NewFangle - Unofficial Perl NewRelic SDK

VERSION

    version 0.03

SYNOPSIS

     use NewRelic;
     my $app = NewRelic::App->new('MyApp', $license_key);
     my $txn = $app->start_transaction('my transaction');
     $txn->end;

DESCRIPTION

    This module provides bindings to the NewRelic C-SDK. Since NewRelic
    doesn't provide native Perl bindings for their product, and the older
    Agent SDK is not supported, this is probably the best way to instrument
    your Perl application with NewRelic.

    This distribution provides a light OO interface using FFI::Platypus and
    will optionally use Alien::libnewrelic if the C-SDK can't be found in
    your library path. Unfortunately the naming convention used by NewRelic
    doesn't always have an obvious mapping to the OO Perl interface, so
    I've added notation (example: (csdk: newrelic_version)) so that the C
    version of functions and methods can be found easily. The documentation
    has decent coverage of all methods, but it doesn't always make sense to
    reproduce everything that is in the C-SDK documentation, so it is
    recommended that you review it before getting started.

    I've called this module NewFangle in the hopes that one day NewRelic
    will write native Perl bindings and they can use the more obvious
    NewRelic namespace.

FUNCTIONS

    These may be imported on request using Exporter.

 newrelic_configure_log

     my $bool = newrelic_configure_log($filename, $level);

    Configure the C SDK's logging system. $level should be one of:

    error

    warning

    info

    debug

    (csdk: newrelic_configure_log)

 newrelic_init

     my $bool = newrelic_init($daemon_socket, $time_limit_ms);

    Initialize the C SDK with non-default settings.

    (csdk: newrelic_init)

 newrelic_version

     my $version = newrelic_version();

    (csdk: newrelic_version)

    Returns the version of the NewRelic C-SDK as a string.

 newrelic_set_hostname

     my $bool = newrelic_set_hostname($hostname);

    Sets the default hostname to be used in the NewRelic UI. This is the
    result of gethostname by default, but that might not be usefully
    meaningful when running in a docker or similar container.

    This requires a properly patched NewRelic C-SDK to work, since the base
    C-SDK doesn't currently support setting the language or version. If you
    installed with Alien::libnewrelic then it should have been properly
    patched for you.

    Returns true if successful, false otherwise. Normally a failure would
    only happen if the NewRelic C-SDK hadn't been patched.

ENVIRONMENT

    NEWRELIC_APP_NAME

      The default app name, if not specified in the configuration.

    NEWRELIC_LICENSE_KEY

      The NewRelic license key.

    NEWRELIC_APP_HOSTNAME

      The host display name that will be reported to NewRelic, if the
      libnewrelic has been properly patched (see newrelic_set_hostname
      above).

CAVEATS

    Unlike the older NewRelic Agent SDK, there is no interface to set the
    programming language or version. Since we are using the C-SDK the
    language shows up as C instead of Perl.
