Version 0.03 - 11th March 2007
    + Added Parse::DMIDecode::Examples POD file containing
      a small selection of useful code examples.

    + Changed Build.PL to be more paranoid defaulting
      to no while using $build->y_n to work around
      potential removal of expected method functionality.

    + Added complain.txt.

    + Removed depencancy on Scalar::Util.

    + Added some additional POD.


Version 0.02 - 22th October 2006
    + Added better support for older versions of dmidecode
      binary output parsing.

    + Improved examples/test.pl.

    + Added examples/synopsis2.pl from the synopsis of
      Parse::DMIDecode::Handle.

    + Allow get_handles() method to be called without any
      qualifying paramaters so to return *All* handle
      objects.

    + Added description() method to handle objects.

    + Added parsed_structures() method to handle objects.

    + Improved parsing inside handle objects to return
      multiple handle objects where appropriate to allow
      easier access to unique data pairs.


Version 0.01 - 19th October 2006
    + Pre-release.

    + Created Parse::DMIDecode::Handle objects for each
      handle structure.

    + Encapsulated the internal data structure which is
      quite fragile so that people cannot just grab items
      out of it.

    + Added accessor methods for header information.

    + Added selection methods to return handle objects.

    + Added a method to return a list of all known
      keyword strings.

    + Added unit tests.

    + Added a whole bunch more since the first release
      was mostly a placeholder.


Version 0.00 - 17th September 2006
    + Initial developer pre-release to save the namespace
      and to discuss API prior to full release.
