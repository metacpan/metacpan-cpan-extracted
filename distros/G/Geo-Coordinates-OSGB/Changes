Revision history for Perl extension Geo::Coordinates::OSGB

2.17 June 2017

    - Put an ':all' tag back in OSGB.pm

    - Restored ability to parse a grid reference consisting of a single sheet name

    - Corrected pod in `build/make_maps_code`

    - Minor updates to documentation

    - More rigorous accuracy test in t/06osdata.t

    - Added small bench mark test


2.16 February 2016

    - Fix bug in OSGB.pm with "unpack" under Perl V5.8

    - Minor documentation corrections

2.15 February 2016

    - Clearer explanation of changes since V2.10 in README and Background.pod

    - Changed examples/plot_maps to use proper OSTN02 polygons instead of just marking points

    - Improved decimal degrees to degrees, minutes, seconds function in examples/bng_to_ll

    - Fixed examples/plot_maps.pl so that it makes a better attempt to show more 
      than one map series on the same plot

    - Minor corrections and additions to documentation

    - Moved build utilities to new 'build' directory + improved documentation for them

    - Packed OSTN02 data more densely so that OSGB.pm is smaller

    - Corrected data points at eastern boundary of OSTN02 area 


2.14 February 2016

    - Found and fixed a bug the core ellipsoid projection routine that was causing 
      the unexpectedly inaccurate results in higher latitudes. 

    - Extensive performance improvements to OSTN02 data look up

    - random_grid function now checks that the random grid position
      it selects is well inside the OSTN02 boundary

    - parse_grid function will now parse a grid square name.  For example
      "parse_grid('TA')" will return (500000,400000).

    - Fixed various typos in Pod sections in all modules, and added more
      explanations in Background.pod

2.13 February 2016

    - Re-organized, and much faster, OSTN02 data look up 

    - format_grid now supports ... { form => 'SS' } ... to get just the grid square.

    - Updated examples with proper documentation and improved plotting of maps

    - Minor change in t/08out_of_range.t and t/13edge.t tests to allow for Perl
      with "long double" enabled.  Corresponding updates to documentation.
      This does not affect any function; I've simply made the tests more
      robust.  I should add that "long doubles" do not appear to benefit this
      module at all.  The results and accuracy that I get are the same with
      "long doubles" but everything runs about 10% slower.

2.12 January 2016

    - Re-worked the handling of points near the boundary of the OSTN02 polygon,
      to avoid a potential loop in rare cases.  This is unlikely to affect any
      transformations with real coordinates (unless you spend a lot of time in
      boats about 10km offshore), but avoids some problems in my testing with
      random grid points.

    - Simplified OSTN02 data access.  Removed the OSGM02 height part of the
      data as this is no longer used.  This makes the module somewhat smaller
      and a little faster to load. 

    - Added user interface to approximate conversion routines for quick Helmert
      transformations:  "grid_to_ll_helmert" and "ll_to_grid_helmert" 

    - Fixed a small bug in "parse_grid", so that it allows '/' character in map
      sheet names, and therefore works with sheet names like: 'B:110/OL44'

    - Corrected structure of POD documentation in Maps.pm and Background.pm

    - Simplified testing of random grid references to give more reliable
      results.  Added more tests based on OS transformations, and to prove
      some edge conditions.
       

2.11 January 2016

    - Small bug fixes only

    - Removed the 'r' switch from the single use of the 'tr' function. This accidentally
      created a dependency on perl 5.14 which caused several CPAN testers to fail 2.10.

    - Added 'use 5.008' to main modules: everything should now work on perl 5.8 or better.

    - Added note about accuracy of OSTN02 in grid square HP (far north of Shetland) and changed
      the random round-trip tests to avoid this square.  For reasons I do not understand, the 
      accuracy of round trip conversion with this implementation of OSTN02 is within a few mm 
      for most of the country, but suddenly drops to an average of about 25m in grid square HP.

    - Minor clean up of pod formatting in a couple of places


2.10 January 2016

    - Complete simplification and restructure of the entire module

    - Geo::Coordinates::OSGB now provides only: 

        grid_to_ll
        ll_to_grid

    - WGS84 is assumed as the default ellipsoid shape
    - OSTN02 data is automatically used where necessary providing much a simpler interface
    - New Helmert transformation routines automatically used outside OSTN02 coverage
    
    - New module Geo::Coordinates::OSGB::Grid provides routines to parse and format grid references
      -- general purpose "format_grid" for all formatting
      -- general purpose "parse_grid" for all parsing
    
    - New module Geo::Coordinates::OSGB::Maps provides outlines, bounding boxes, and titles for OSGB maps


2.09 October 2015

    - Improved and generalized handling of maps to allow for multiple series, insets, and irregular boundaries
    - New generic functions "format_grid_map" and "parse_map_grid" to replace the Landranger-specific functions
    - Complete insets and extensions to sheet boundaries for Landranger maps
    - Complete sheet boundaries for old One Inch 7th series maps
    - Complete sheet boundaries for Explorer series of 1:25000 maps
    - Reorganized distribution: 
      -- example scripts are in examples/
      -- map definitions are in maps/
    - Minor improvements to precision

2.08 June 2015

    - reduced size of the data table in OSTN02 and improved loading time

    - new "random_grid" function in OSGB returns a random point on a random Landranger map.

    - removed unnecessary package variables from OSTN02
    - simplified unpacking of data in OSTN02

2.06  October 2013

    - removed non-ascii characters from POD in OSGB.pm to avoid encoding issue
    
2.05  31 August 2013

    - Put blank lines back in OSTN02 to prevent pod2html taking an age during install
    - Refactored OSGB and OSTN02 lightly to conform more closely to "Perl Best Practices"
    - corrected corner coordinate data for Landranger sheets 1 and 185

    - Removed irritating degree sign from verbose test message (no functional change)
    - Make parse_landranger_grid behave better in scalar context
    - Improve useability of parse_grid
    - Correct GR of SW corner of Landranger Sheet 3
    - Further optimize handling of OSTN02 data to prevent data parsing at pod2man time
    - Improve documentation

2.01 6 September 2007

    - Optimized handling of OSTN02 data to reduce memory requirements *and* speed it up.

2.00 4 September 2007

    - New version with routines to do adjustment to and from latitude and
      longitude coordinates based on the (now ubiquitous) WGS84 model, for
      more compatible use with GPS receivers and Google Earth and similar
      tools.

    - Includes not only fast approximate adjustment as used in most
      coordinate tools and devices, but also the definitive-but-slow OSTN02
      transformation based on OSGB data

    - Step version number

    - POD completely revised


1.07 7 September 2005

       - corrected link in POD

       - various minor documentation corrections

1.06 16 May 2005

       - general clean up

       - made the format and parse routines external to avoid spaghetti connections

       - added support for grid references in GPS format (eg TQ 32342 24312)

1.05 29 March 2005

       - Not released

1.04  29 September 2004

        - corrected a bug in grid2ll, where long/lat values with 0 degrees
          were always printed as positive in scalar form The problem was that
          -1 * 0 = +0 in Perl (as it says in the Camel book somewhere).

        - added simple coco.pl script to provide command line coordinate
          conversions.

        - actually implemented the long-promised map2ll and ll2map functions
          as well as map2grid and grid2map for completeness.  With these
          functions you can convert to and from coordinates in a more useable
          form, such as "OS Sheet 43; 875123".

        - added a demonstration script --- plotmaps.pl --- which will produce
          a pretty index of the Landranger maps, showing the GB coast line
          and the large grid squares.  The output is in PostScript.  Use
          GhostScript to process it.  A PDF version of the output is also
          included.

        - added a useful file with all the names and other details of the
          Landranger Sheets

1.03  18 December 2002
        - changed name for CPAN release
        - improved ll2grid function
        - new ll2map and map2ll functions
