svg2zinc-perl (0.10) unstable; urgency=low

  * thx to tkzinc 3.2.96, SVG skew and matrix properties are now well interpreted 

 --

svg2zinc-perl (0.9) unstable; urgency=low

  * a better loading of Backend (specially if the backend has some errors
    they are now correctly printed)
  * compatible with the future Tk::Zinc::Debug new api (to come with TkZinc 3.2.96)
  * perl classes generated can now define in which group items will be added
  * a sample script to test generated perl classes (with PerlClass backend): 
  * make test should test that backend works correctly (after some bug report 
    from R. Oger)

svg2zinc-perl (0.8) unstable; urgency=low

  * unknown -render options appeared for some backend
  * -out options was falsely required by Display and Print backend
  * suppression of some unusefull prints
  * better testing of the existence of userdefined Backend
  * svg2zinc.pl now tests if there is an outfile required by some Backend,
    and warns in the case of user defined Backend
  * slight doc enhancements

svg2zinc-perl (0.7) unstable; urgency=low

  * BEWARE: Tk::Zinc must be 3.295 or higher. but no dependancies
    because this module can be used without Tk::Zinc installed
  * Backend can now be easily extended, without modifying SVG::SVG2zinc or
    even svg2zinc.pl
  * Provided with two new backends: Image and TclScript (highly experimental) 
  * enhanced manpages for svg2zinc.pl, SVG::SVG2zinc and SVG::SVG2zinc::Backend

svg2zinc-perl (0.6) unstable; urgency=low

  * adding README, cpaniser script, MANIFEST (generated),
  * update Tk::Zinc dependancy
  * renaming the ZincExtension sub-module as Tk::Zinc::SVGExtension

svg2zinc-perl (0.5) unstable; urgency=low

  * slight evolutions to CPANise this module

svg2zinc-perl (0.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * backend classes have been defined. They are currently the following:
    Exec (for displayng the SVG code with TkZinc)
    PerlModule (for generating a perl module able to display the SVG file
    PerlScript (for generating a perl script able to display the SVG file
    Print (for simply printing on the stdout the perl code)
  * Some conversion functions have been extracted and put in the
    Conversions.pm sub-module
  * addition of approx. 40 tests for the Conversions.pm sub-module
  * svg path defined as bezier quadratic are converted to bezier cubic
    (thx lemort@intuilab.com and with the help of Math::Bezier::Convert)
  * gradient can be defined as other gradient with transparency
  * we now limit the number of printed lines when a not-implemented
    attribute is used many many times
  * uuencoded images included in a SVG file are now correctly displayed
    (thx lemort@intuilab.com)
  * some bugs corrections, many detected and/or corrected by lemort@intuilab.com

svg2zinc-perl (0.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * now compatible with both zinc-perl 3.2.6h and 3.2.6i (support both gradient syntax)
    Beware: 3.2.6i should be prefered since it corrects some frequent bugs
    with curves containing aligned control points
    There is now an option -version for both the parser and the svg2zinc script.
  * colors defined in svg/html but not in X defaut rgb.txt have been added
  * many bugs correction (opacity, svg id cleaning, some parsing errors, ...)

svg2zinc-perl (0.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * fill-rule is now implemented for path (thanks to zinc 3.2.6h and plc work)
  * SVG tags may be recognized even if they are prefixed with a namespace
    (-namespace arguments in both parser and svg2zinc script)
  * not (yet) implemented svg tags are detected and a warning is issued
  * not implementable tags are identified and their usage is summarized at
    the end of parsing
  * shapes with bezier are now fine;
  * multicontour shapes should be ok
  * some css are now correctly interpreted
  * works with zinc-perl 3.2.6h or higher
  * addition of some samples, either from SVG recommandation, or generated from dia
  * WARNING: some curves containing bezier segements will make zinc 3.2.6h coredump
  due to a zinc 3.2.6h bug
  * This version of svg2zinc-perl will not work any more with the next release of zinc
  due to incompatible evolution in color and gradient specification of zinc

svg2zinc-perl (0.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Initial Release. Attention, il y a encore de nombreux défauts
