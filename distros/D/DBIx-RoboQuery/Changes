  - Minor optimizations to row fetching

0.031     2012-09-30T04:24:21Z

0.030     2012-09-26T03:19:09Z

  [Backward Incompatible Bugfix]
  - Fixed internal template processing which previously ignored errors
    processing 'preference' templates.
    This was considered a bug as exceptions would silently cause preference
    to essentially be ignored (and always choose the last record).
    NOTE: this could cause errors to be thrown in the resultset stage
    if the templates passed to "prefer()" don't compile.

  [Enhancements]
  - Add 'template_private_vars' option
    to control Template's handling of "private" variables.

0.021     2012-09-01T17:49:59Z

  - Add 'squeeze_blank_lines' option
  - Add 'tr_fields()' and 'tr_groups()' as shortcuts for 'transform()'

0.019     2012-06-09T17:31:46Z

0.018     2012-05-13T05:17:22Z

  - Include transformations in 'fetch' time for array()
    for consistency with hash() (and documentation (and future changes)).
