Revision history for Perl extension XML::Elemental.

2.11  Nov 24 2009
    - Fixed another circular reference that was causing memeory leaks.

2.1   Jan 06 2008
    - Dropped Class::Accessor dependency in favor of our own simple 
      lighter weight accessors. Less is more. ;)
    - Added in_element and ancestors methods to all nodes. 
    - Added the root_element method to XML::Elemental::Document.
    - Added tests for root_element, in_element and ancestors.
    - Fixed contents and attributes so they absolutely will return an
      empty ARRAY or HASH reference (respectively) if not set.

2.02  Jan 02 2008
    - Nothing new. Just the intended version number for the last 
      release.

2.012 Jan 02 2008
    - I found a break in 2.01 whereby the root method would 
      return the object being wrapped and not the proxy object.
      Small, but significant enough break that I decided to reverse 
      changes made in 2.01. No more proxy object and
      Object::Destroyer. Instead I'm using the weaken method in
      Scalar::Util making it and Task::Weaken new
      dependencies as of this release. Weak reference was a
      new feature in Perl 5.6.0 thereby making that the required
      minimum version.

2.011 Jan 01 2008
    - Nothing new. Just a distribution sans the %$!*#~@ OS X
      resource files. (Note to self add 'export
      COPYFILE_DISABLE=1' in .bash_profile on all Leopard
      machines.)
      
2.01  Dec 31 2007
    - POTENTIAL BREAK: Rearranged code to address the
      boneheaded oversight of using a circular reference in
      the parse tree and failing to breaking up. This caused
      memory to leak. The change involved making
      XML::Elemental::Document a subclass of
      Object::Destroyer that works as a proxy to the real
      object implementation. This *should* be entirely
      transparent to existing code; however, there is the
      possibility that I overlooked some usage scenario that
      this change will break.

2.0  Nov 16 2005
    - Convert to SAX-based system. (XML::Elemental::SAXHandler
      added to the distribution.)
    - Switched to Clarkian notation
