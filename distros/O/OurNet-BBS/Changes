[Changes for 1.67 - 2011-11-11]

* Do not attempt to build for Perl 5.10+, as this module depends on pseudohashes.

* Modernize the build process again to the latest Module::Install release.

* Add this notice to README:

    (Currently, this project exists mainly for historical/archival purposes,
    not for active development.)
