## It is also a *very* good idea to add rules to avoid users from seeing
## or accessing files outside their home directories. It would also be nice
## to prevent access to the quota file. The rules below might be too fascist
## for your site, so edit accordingly.

retrieve rule: $dirname =~ m!^/h/././././$user/pwp/! && $filename !~ m/^\./
store rule: $dirname =~ m!^/h/././././$user/pwp/! && $filename !~ m/^\./
delete rule: $dirname =~ m!^/h/././././$user/pwp/! && $filename !~ m/^\./
mkdir rule: $dirname =~ m!^/h/././././$user/pwp/! && $filename !~ m/^\./
rename rule: $dirname =~ m!^/h/././././$user/pwp/! && $filename !~ m/^\./

#** The rule below requires patching Net::FTPServer. See the ./patches
#** directory for more info. Instructions for doing this are omitted on
#** purpose.
