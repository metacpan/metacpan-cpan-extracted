Revision history for Tk-DirSelect

1.12 (2010-02-17)
    * Dual-licensed under Artistic 2.0 and GPL.

1.11 (2005-08-19)
    * DirTree no longer resets to cwd after a rename.

1.10 (2005-08-17)
    * Under Tk v804+, make BrowseEntry not look disabled just because it's
      readonly.
    * Added context menu for creating, renaming and deleting directories.

1.09 (2004-10-22)
    * Pass additional arguments to Show() on to Popup().
    * For Show() default the initial directory to cwd only when first argument
      is undef, not false. (Just in case someone actually has a directory
      named '0')

1.08 (2004-10-22)
    * On Win32, added a work-around for scrollbars sometimes appearing disabled.

1.07 (2004-05-21)
    * On Win32, added a work-around for inability to see other folders in the 
      root directory of the drive containing the initial directory. Reselecting 
      the drive from the drop menu now displays contents properly. (The root 
      cause of the bug is in DirTree or one of its parent classes...)
    * Fixed $VERSION in DirSelect.pm (Oops.)

1.06 (2004-05-20)
    * Add Tk as dependancy in Makefile.PL. Should be beyond obvious to
      end users, but automated test sites aren't as smart. :)

1.05 (2004-05-20)
    * First CPAN release.
    * Added a patch for HList behavior changes around Tk 804.025. Corrects
      the problem where Show() returned an ARRAY ref instead of a string.

1.04 (2004-05-19)
    * Cleaned up guts (no longer recreates a DirTree for each drive change)
    * Generate drive list upon display, not creation.
    * Initial directory now an argument to Show() (not creation)
    * Better display of initial directory.
    * Changed title from default, allow user to set (at creation)

1.03 (2004-05-19)
    * Maintenance taken over by Michael Carman.
    * Use a BrowseEntry instead of buttons for Win32 drives
    * Restores cwd after finished.
    * Better passthrough of args to DirTree.
    * Lots of miscellaneous tweaks.
