=head1 CONFIGURATION

Although this has been tested on celmorlauren's system, it is recommended that you also test it on your own system, to enable this, this program will need changing to suit your site. To keep this simple all you need do is to provide some values for the method B<testing_domains> example shown below.


    testing_domains <<TESTING;
    # 1st line is one of (OUR, OK, BAD)
    OUR
    # data lines have the format
    # HELO, DOMAIN (resolves to), IP (connected from), RESOLVE {client_resolve}, FROM (mail from), RCPT (mail to)
    # where an IP address does not resolve, use "0" in its DOMAIN field, and place FAIL in the RESOLVE field
    # other values for RESOLVE are (OK FAIL FORGED TEMP)
    #
    # HELO              DOMAIN  IP          RESOLVE     FROM                        RCPT
