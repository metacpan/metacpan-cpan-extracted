DESCRIPTION
    WWW::Hashbang::Pastebin::Client is, as you might expect, a client
    library for interfacing with WWW::Hashbang::Pastebin websites. It also
    ships with an example command-line client p.

METHODS
  new
    Creates a new client object. You must provide the URL of the
    WWW::Hashbang::Pastebin site you want to talk to:

        my $client = WWW::Hashbang::Pastebin::Client->new(url => 'http://p.hashbang.ca');

  paste
    Create a new paste on the specified website. Specify either "file" to
    read in the named file, or "paste" to provide the text directly:

        # create a paste from a string
        my $pasted_string_url = $client->paste(paste => rand());

        # create a paste from a file
        my $pasted_file_url = $client->paste(file => '/var/log/syslog');

        print "$pasted_string_url\n$pasted_file_url\n";

  put
    This is a synonym for "paste".

  get
    Get paste content from the pastebin. Pass just the ID of the paste:

        # retrieve paste content by paste ID
        print $client->get('b'), "\n";

  retrieve
    This is a synonym for "get"
