NAME
    IO::Tty - Low-level allocate a pseudo-Tty, import constants.

VERSION
    1.20

SYNOPSIS
        use IO::Tty qw(TIOCNOTTY);
        ...
        # use only to import constants, see IO::Pty to create ptys.

DESCRIPTION
    "IO::Tty" is used internally by "IO::Pty" to create a pseudo-tty. You
    wouldn't want to use it directly except to import constants, use
    "IO::Pty". For a list of importable constants, see IO::Tty::Constant.

    Windows is now supported, but ONLY under the Cygwin environment, see
    <http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin/>.

    Please note that pty creation is very system-dependend. From my
    experience, any modern POSIX system should be fine. Find below a list of
    systems that "IO::Tty" should work on. A more detailed table (which is
    slowly getting out-of-date) is available from the project pages document
    manager at SourceForge <http://sourceforge.net/projects/expectperl/>.

    If you have problems on your system and your system is listed in the
    "verified" list, you probably have some non-standard setup, e.g. you
    compiled your Linux-kernel yourself and disabled ptys (bummer!). Please
    ask your friendly sysadmin for help.

    If your system is not listed, unpack the latest version of "IO::Tty", do
    a 'perl Makefile.PL; make; make test; uname -a' and send me
    (RGiersig@cpan.org) the results and I'll see what I can deduce from
    that. There are chances that it will work right out-of-the-box...

    If it's working on your system, please send me a short note with details
    (version number, distribution, etc. 'uname -a' and 'perl -V' is a good
    start; also, the output from "perl Makefile.PL" contains a lot of
    interesting info, so please include that as well) so I can get an
    overview. Thanks!

VERIFIED SYSTEMS, KNOWN ISSUES
    This is a list of systems that "IO::Tty" seems to work on ('make test'
    passes) with comments about "features":

    *   AIX 4.3

        Returns EIO instead of EOF when the slave is closed. Benign.

    *   AIX 5.x

    *   FreeBSD 4.4

        EOF on the slave tty is not reported back to the master.

    *   OpenBSD 2.8

        The ioctl TIOCSCTTY sometimes fails. This is also known in
        Tcl/Expect, see http://expect.nist.gov/FAQ.html

        EOF on the slave tty is not reported back to the master.

    *   Darwin 7.9.0

    *   HPUX 10.20 & 11.00

        EOF on the slave tty is not reported back to the master.

    *   IRIX 6.5

    *   Linux 2.2.x & 2.4.x

        Returns EIO instead of EOF when the slave is closed. Benign.

    *   OSF 4.0

        EOF on the slave tty is not reported back to the master.

    *   Solaris 8, 2.7, 2.6

        Has the "feature" of returning EOF just once?!

        EOF on the slave tty is not reported back to the master.

    *   Windows NT/2k/XP (under Cygwin)

        When you send (print) a too long line (>160 chars) to a non-raw pty,
        the call just hangs forever and even alarm() cannot get you out.
        Don't complain to me...

        EOF on the slave tty is not reported back to the master.

    *   z/OS

    The following systems have not been verified yet for this version, but a
    previous version worked on them:

    *   SCO Unix

    *   NetBSD

        probably the same as the other *BSDs...
