  [Changes]

  - The Gerrit::REST::Exception module was an attempt to provide structured
  exceptions for this module. But its implementation and usage was becoming
  more complex than useful. So, we get rid of it and change the interface so
  that now error messages are consistently formatted and thrown using
  Carp::croak.
