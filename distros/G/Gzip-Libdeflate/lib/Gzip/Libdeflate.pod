=head1 NAME

Gzip::Libdeflate - Libdeflate compression library

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    
    use Gzip::Libdeflate;
    my $gl = Gzip::Libdeflate->new (level => 12);
    my $out = $gl->compress ("ABCDEFG" x 2);
    print length ($out), "\n";
    my $rt = $gl->decompress ($out);
    print "$rt\n";
    


produces output

    29
    ABCDEFGABCDEFG

=head1 VERSION

This documents version 0.02 of Gzip-Libdeflate
corresponding to L<git commit 009e90b2d795e8a4412e4590c482d1ce8b50d30c|https://github.com/benkasminbullock/gzip-libdeflate/commit/009e90b2d795e8a4412e4590c482d1ce8b50d30c> released on Sun Feb 21 09:08:43 2021 +0900. This
distribution also includes libdeflate version 1.7. 

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides an interface to libdeflate. Libdeflate is a
newly-written compression library which offers the same C<deflate>
form of compression as zlib, as used in gzip, libpng and many similar
utilities. This distribution includes libdeflate within itself, so it
is not necessary to have that on your system.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 compress

    my $comp_thing = $gl->compress ($thing);

Compress input C<$thing> using whatever compression level and type you
have specified for C<$gl> in L</new>.

=head2 decompress

    my $thing = $gl->decompress ($dthing);

Decompress C<$comp_thing> into C<$thing>. If you have chosen the
C<zlib> or C<deflate> options in L</new>, you also need to
specify the expected size of C<$thing>.

    my $thing = $gl->decompress ($dthing, 1000);

In the C<gzip> format, the size is stored within the data itself, so
it doesn't need to be specified.

=head2 new

    my $gl = Gzip::Libdeflate->new (%options);

Possible options are

=over

=item level

    my $gl = Gzip::Libdeflate->new (level => 9);

A numerical argument of compression level from 1 (fast and poor
compression) to 12 (slow and good compression).  If you do not specify
it, the default is 6. These correspond to the compression levels of
zlib, but with extra compression levels 10-12 also added. See L</About
libdeflate> for details. 

As with zlib, there is also a "zero compression" option of level 0
which just puts the input into the gzip format without compressing it
at all.

=item type

    my $gl = Gzip::Libdeflate->new (type => 'deflate');

Change the type of compression. The default is type C<gzip> but you
can also choose C<deflate> and C<zlib>. These are all the same thing
up to headers.

=head2 About libdeflate

Libdeflate is a new library which offers the same form of deflate
compression as offered by C<zlib>. From its README:

=over

libdeflate is a library for fast, whole-buffer DEFLATE-based
compression and decompression.
