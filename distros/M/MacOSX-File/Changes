! bin/psync
  Addressed: #!/usr/local/bin/perl missing, causing unsuable 
  script being installed.  Ouch!
  Message-Id: <9E018196-A9C6-4F0F-B5D9-6236CD358928@ppp.bekkoame.ne.jp>

0.70  2005/08/09 15:47:00
+ t/AskGetFileInfo.pm
! t/catalog.t t/info.t
  Modified so it passes under Tiger.
! File.pm bin/*
  tiger's utilities are now mentioned in pod
! bin/psync 
  is now replaced with that of Jean-Louis Fuchs

! File.pm Catalog/Catalog.pm Spec/Spec.pm Copy/Copy.pm Info/Info.pm
  s/use 5.6.0;/use 5.006;/ so v-string warning on 5.8.1-RC3 is quiet.

0.68 2004/05/25 16:03:23
! Catalog/Makefile.PL Info/Makefile.PL Copy/Makefile.PL Spec/Makefile.PL
  Now uses gcc2 when perl version is 5.8.1 or before  so it compiles
  without 'make CC=gcc2' on Apple-bundled /usr/bin/perl

0.67 2004/05/03 14:53:29
! Copy/filecopy.c Spec/Spec.xs common/util.c
  Panther compatibility patch by emoy applied.

0.66 2003/04/09 08:25:26
! Copy/filecopy.c
  Now supports file names that contains \x{10000} and higher.
  HFS+ stores characters in UTF-16 but until now MacOSX::File only
  suported UCS-2 (Apple's document only says "Unicode".  Sigh).
! bin/psync
  Addressed the problem that the ownership of the locked files are not
  copied correctly.  Reported by Joel Sumner <joel.sumner@ni.com>
  Message-Id: <5.1.1.6.0.20030408162041.04bce6d8@postoffice.natinst.com>

    ! common/util.c
      s/strcpy/strncpy/  I though I fixed it :)
    ! Catalog/Catalog.xs
      Guy Sabourin <guysab@videotron.ca> has reported that an evil typecast
      found in the code above was preventing MacOSX::File::Catalog from
      copying creator properly.  Though I could not duplicate his claim
      on my environment (compiler difference?), his version is definitely
      better.
      Message-Id: <BA504461.3E6E%guysab@videotron.ca>
      FYI, psync and other scripts that come with this package use
      MacOSX::File::Info rather than MacOSX::File:Catalog in favor of speed
      and memory so they are unaffected as of this release.
0.64  2002.03.07
      ! bin/psync
        ! uses MacOSX::File::Info instead of MacOSX::File::Catalog
	  back again.
        + pod improvement
0.63  2002.03.07
      ! File.pm README
        Mention to binary distribution dropped;  I will release binary
	distribution elsewhere.  CPAN infrastracture is not quite fit
	for binary distribution.
0.62  2002.03.07
      ! File.pm
	+ unlink() which overrides CORE::unlink that deletes '._file'
	  if 'file' is deleted
      ! Catalog/Catalog.xs Info/Info.xs
        File Locking scheme changed so that it works on UFS volume
        more correctly.  Now 'make test' on UFS volume works.
      ! bin/psync
        uses MacOSX::File::Catalog instead of MacOSX::File::Info
0.61  2002.01.28
      ! Info/Info.xs Catalog/Catalog.xs
       * $obj->set() without argument failed
0.60  2002.01.28
      ! */*.xs
        * (data|rsrc)(Logical|Physical)size is now NV instead of IV
	to accomodate 64bit values (same trick done in stat->size in
	Perl's stat cache)
        * Other members of FSCatalogInfo is now more compliant with
	Inside Macintosh (UV instead of IV where appropriate)
      ! bin/psync
        * cosmetic changes for opt_v
0.52  2002.01.20
      ! bin/psync
        Code optimization
	More intuitive option settings
0.51  2002.01.20
      ! bin/psync
        Greatly enhanced.  See the manual for details
      ! Copy/filecopy.c
        More housekeeping functions added
0.50  2002.01.19
      ! Makefile.PL
        INSTALLSCRIPT  => /usr/local/bin
        INSTALLMAN1DIR => /usr/local/share/man/man1
        INSTALLMAN3DIR => /usr/local/share/man/man3

      This iso prevent clobbering important files on /usr/{bin,/share/man} .
      Though this is against platform-independent Makefile.PL, this module 
      is very platform-dependent to begin with.

      + bin/psync
        Does update copy.  The very reason I wanted a module like this!
      ! Catalog/Catalog.pm
      ! Info/Info.pm
        set* subs now checks validity of information so it won't call
	xs_* when invalid.
      ! Copy/Copy.pm
        $nocopycat -> $preserve
	Note now the default is reversed!
0.42  2002.01.16
      ! bin/pcpmac
        regex bug that causes all dot-files ignored gets fixed
	< my @f = grep !/^\.[\._]?/o, readdir $d;
        > my @f = grep !/^\.(?:\.?$|_)/o, readdir $d;
        Well, to err is human.
0.41  2002.01.13
      * documention
      * verious fixes
0.40  2002.01.13
      - MoreFiles/*
        MacOSX::File now implements its own, FSSpec-free file
	copy function so MoreFiles is gone!
      + bin/pcpmac
      + bin/pmvmac
      * various bugfixes
0.30  2002.01.13
      + bin/pgetfinfo
      + bin/pgetfinfo
      + t/benchmark.pl
      ! common/util.c
        minor bug at dirname() fixed;
      ! FSp(Set|Rst)Lock done when and only when the target is file
        (When done to directory, Carbon slaps you with segfault!)
      * and lots of bug fixes and cleanups here and there
0.21  2002.01.10
      ! Info/Info.xs, Catalog/Catalog.xs 
        possible memory leak fixed
0.20  2002.01.10
      + MacOSX::File::Catalog added
      ! Info/Info.xs -- FSpRstLock() before FSSetCatalogInfo()
0.11  2002.01.08
      + File/Constants.pm
      ! Info/Info.pm -- constants moved to Constants.pm
      ! Info/Info.xs -- possible memory leak fixed.
0.10  2002.01.06
      First Release
