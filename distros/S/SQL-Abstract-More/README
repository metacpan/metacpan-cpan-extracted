SQL-Abstract-More

This subclass of L<SQL::Abstract> handles a few additional SQL
constructs, and provides an improved API with named parameters instead
of positional parameters.  It was designed for the specific needs of
L<DBIx::DataModel> but is published as a separate distribution,
because it may possibly be useful for other needs.
