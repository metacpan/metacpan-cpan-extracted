    body.
  - Reworked start / stop commands and added examples and documentation.
  - Added Test::Clustericious::Command for testing clustericious commands.
    Interface to be documented better later.

  - Migrate from JSON::XS to JSON::MaybeXS
  - Much less pollution of Clustericious::Config.
  - Added some testing functions to Test::Clustericious::Log
    previously it simply redirected logging to TAP via
    Log::Log4perl::Appender::TAP (which it still does).
  - Generally improved documentation coverage for Test::Clustericious::Log

1.04      2015-11-17 10:36:15 -0500
  - Fixed bug where using a single string as start_mode
    (instead of a list) would crash the configuration.

  - By default use a sane "hypnotoad" configuration
    for start_mode, if it isn't specified.

    code reference.  The code reference will be
    evaluated to determine the default value if it
    isn't provided by the configuration file.

1.02      2015-11-03 13:01:00 -0500
  - Re-release of Clustericious 1.01 due to errors in
    the release process
  - Better integration with Test::Clustericious::Cluster
    allows you to test with Clustericious::Client objects
    without replacing their Mojo::UserAgent objects.
  - Clustericious::Client user agent string will now include the
    Clustericious and App versions so that they can be easier
    to identify in logs.  Example for Yars:
    "Clustericious::Client/1.01 Yars/1.11"
  - A number of small Mojolicious compatability fixes
  - You can now customize client objects as they are created
    for local needs by creating class method
     Clustericious::Client::Locak->local($client)
    this change is experimental (and otherwise undocumented)
    and may be removed refactored in the future.
