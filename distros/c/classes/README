NAME
    classes - conventional Perl 5 classes

VERSION
    Version 0.940

SUMMARY

    A simple, stable, fast, and flexible way to use Perl 5 classes.
    If you look at no other Perl OO module look at this one, really. If
    you have done OO in Perl you will find this comfortably familiar. If
    not you may save yourself time and pain learning the classes
    pragma first or as you learn Perl OO--many have already.
