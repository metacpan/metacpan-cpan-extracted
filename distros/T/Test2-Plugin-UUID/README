NAME

    Test2::Plugin::UUID - Use REAL UUIDs in Test2

DESCRIPTION

    Test2 normally uses unique IDs generated by appending pid, thread-id,
    and an incrementing integer. These work fine most of the time, but are
    not sufficient if you want to keep a database of events, in that case a
    real UUID is much more useful.

SYNOPSIS

        use Test2::Plugin::UUID;

    This is also useful at the command line for 1-time use:

        $ perl -MTest2::Plugin::UUID path/to/test.t
