2.04  Add support to dump out the results from the database as
      diagnosics with verbose_data / TEST_DBROW_VERBOSE_DATA

2.03  Wrap qw() with () in foreach loops (thus avoiding deprecation
      warnings on 5.14.  (Thanks to Gabor Szabo for pull request)

      Fix tests to delete sqlite test database on Windows (Thanks
      to Gabor Szabo for pull request)

2.02  Changed "label" to "diagnostic" (but kept backwards compatible
      accepting of old object.)

      Fix bug where an invalid comparison operator would cause test
      failure rather than throwing an exception (bad input should
      create exceptions, not fail tests)

      Added better error messages when passing invalid tests in.

      Improved commenting and flow control for better maintainability.

2.01  Add tests that use DBD::SQLite to test a real database

      Fix the bugs with the DBI interface (thanks to ilmari for pointing
      these out)

2.00  Added Test::DatabaseRow::Object and Test::DatabaseRow::Result.
      
      Rewrote Test::DatabaseRow to use these classes to do everything

      Added "all_rows_ok" function and ability to check all database rows
      returned

      improved test coverage.

      Fix for bug where 
         tests => [ "time" => "2011-11-11 11:32:26" ]
      would have been interpreted as 
         tests => { '==' => { "time" => "2011-11-11 11:32:26" } }
      not
         tests => { 'eq' => { "time" => "2011-11-11 11:32:26" } } 

1.05  fix for 5.13.6+ new regualar expression stringification breaking our own
      test suite

      Moved to Module::Install instead of Module::Build.

      Add standard Kwalitee tests and make them pass.

      Fixed the eval statements to cope with resetting of $@ in a DESTROY
      block (an issue in Perl 5.12 and below)

      Addressed a bug that could leave fatal errors enabled on on the passed
      database handle after an exception had been raised

      Addresses a bug where the arrayref passed as the "sql" argument
      would be altered

      Improved the documentation

      Refactored a lot of code;  Switch bracing convention.  Removed the
      sub package.

      Disabled "use warnings" making this compatible with 5.004

      (this release never made it to the CPAN)

1.04  added utf8 hack to allow data from the database to be marked as utf8
      before it's compared to anything

1.03  added the ability to get at the results after you've run row_ok

1.02  Added Build.PL to the MANIFEST (oops)

      Patches from Andy Lester to mean:

      Fixed docs on not_row_ok.

      results, max_results and min_results now show the actual
      incorrect values, instead of hardcoded leftovers.

1.01  added negative assertions, due to request from pudge and
      Andy reminding me about it.

1.00  finally fixed warnings problem with Leon Brocard's help
      added bind parameters with arrayref being passsed to sql
      added documentation of how to use with SQL::Abstract

0.06  allowed test without 'tests' to just check for existance
      of rows

0.05  added Test::Warn based tests

0.04  verbose mode added
      WHERE 1 = 1 removed due to Richard Clamp's nagging

0.03  NULL behavior added
