NAME

    Zilla::Dist - Dist::Zilla Mixed Up

VERSION

    This document describes Zilla::Dist version 0.1.5.

SYNOPSIS

        > zild Meta
        > # Edit the Meta file.
        > zild release

DESCRIPTION

    This module is a formalization of a Perl package directory layout and
    release process that I have been evolving for some time. I use the same
    layout for Bash, Ruby, Python and Node.js package publishing.

    Zilla::Dist provides a Makefile and set of scripts that take a modern
    code layout and transform it into something that looks like a standard
    old Perl distribution. Under the hood zild generates everything that
    Dist::Zilla wants and lets dzil do the heavy lifting, but you never
    need to interact with Dist::Zilla stuff directly.

 Directory Layout

    A fully stacked top level CPAN package repository might look like this:

        Changes         # History in YAML
        Contributing    # A generated instruction file for contributing
        Meta            # Meta info for all metadata needs (including dzil)
        ReadMe.pod      # Generated from `doc/Module.swim`
        .travis.yml     # Travis file (generated)
        bin/            # Scripts
        doc/            # Swim docs
        ext/            # External repos (subrepos)
        eg/             # Examples
        lib/            # Perl `.pm` code
        pkg/            # Packaging related files
        note/           # Project notes, todo lists, ideas, specs, etc
        share/          # Shared files to distribute
        test/           # Test suite

    Note a few things:

      * Sane/Readable names

      * Directories are lowercase. Never plural

      * Files are TitleCase

      * No file extensions (if possible)

      * No extra meta files like dist.ini, .travis.yml, bower.json etc

    These are the best of from all the package systems I've used. They make
    me happy, and not tied to poor legacy standards.

 Zilla::Dist

    Zilla::Dist uses a Makefile to do everything, but you never see it. You
    run commands like:

        zild make test

    Run zild make help to get a list of all the targets.

    The most common targets don't require you to type make. For instance,
    you can simply:

        zild test

    Here are the most important targets:

    zild release

      Build the dist, then cpan-upload it.

    zild test

      Run the test suite.

    zild install

      Build and install the software. Same as install from CPAN.

    zild update

      Rebuild the ReadMe.pod and other generated files.

    zild prereqs

      Install the prereqs from CPAN that are listed in the Meta file's
      requires: field.

    zild cpan

      Turn repo into a Dist::Zilla ready subdirectory called ./cpan/. This
      directory has a dist.ini file.

    zild dist

      Basically the same as zild cpan; cd cpan; dzil build.

USAGE

    Start by running:

        cp `zild sharedir`/Meta .

    and you'll get a Meta file template. You need to customize the Meta
    file with information specific to your project.

    To do a release, just set a new version in the Meta file and add a
    Changes section using the same version. Then run:

        zild release

    This will:

      * Make sure things are ready for release.

      * Update the modules with $VERSION to the new version.

      * Make a dzil ready directory of your stuff called ./cpan/.

      * Call dzil build.

      * Call cpan-upload to send the dist to CPAN.

      * Tag the git repo with the version string.

      * git push the repo and tag upstream.

 Release in Depth

    This section lists all the things that actually happen during the zild
    release step.

    …to be completed…

RATIONALE RANTING

    I've published a lot of packages in a lot of programming languages. I
    like taking the best ideas and spreading them around. I like reusing
    ideas and code and tools as much as possible between these packages.

    I trust dzil to DTRT with regard to the CPAN release process. I use
    almost the exact same dist.ini for some 50 CPAN packages that I've
    converted so far.

    I don't like cluttered repos and adding new metadata files for each new
    tool that needs one. The dist.ini file is not bad, but I can generate
    it from metadata easily. So I do.

    As much as these great new ideas differ from the norm, I want my CPAN
    publishings to be normal to normal mongers (if there's such a thing).
    The zild release process does just that. End users would have to look
    hard to know this wasn't a "normal" dzil release.

    I'm packaging this packaging process as Zilla::Dist for others to use.
    It's also a decent example of a CPAN package packaged with itself.

NOTES

    Some of the tools in Zilla::Dist are Bash, some are Perl. I'm doing a
    lot in the area of Bash Package packaging. See http://bpan.org.

    I use the term Package where CPAN people have used the term
    Distribution. Perl is the only language (in my packaging experience) to
    do so.

    The name t/ is another outlier. The most common is test/ followed by
    tests/.

    I don't like plural directory names. Try singular. I think you'll like
    it too.

    ALLCAPSFILENAMES ARE TOO LOUD! ChillOut.

 Commiting Generated Code/Files

    People think that committing generated code/files is a bad idea and in
    general I concur, but there are exceptions.

    Sometimes tools like Travis-CI require you to commit a config file.
    Zilla::Dist generates these files from metadata, which is a whole lot
    easier than maintaining them yourself, but you end up commiting
    generated code.

    The dist.ini file is only needed locally, however, during dist build
    time, so no need to commit that.

    In general, when an external tool requires files, and it's easiest to
    generate those files, it's OK to commit generated code.
