Glib::Ex::ConnectProperties helps you link together properties on
different objects so a change to any one of them is automatically
propagated to the others.

The same can be done with your own signal handlers, but
ConnectProperties is designed to make it easier, and in particular can
protect against infinite loops if one signal raises another.

The only prerequisite is Glib-Perl, but you can't do much with Glib
alone so you'll probably be using ConnectProperties with Gtk2-Perl and
friends.  The ConnectProperties home page is
