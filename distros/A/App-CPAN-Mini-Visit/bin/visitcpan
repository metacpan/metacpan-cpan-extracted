=head1 NAME

visitcpan - explore each distribution in a minicpan repository

=head1 VERSION

version 0.008

=head1 SYNOPSIS

     $ visitcpan [OPTIONS] [PROGRAM]
 
     $ visitcpan [OPTIONS] -- [PROGRAM] [ARGS]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This program executes other programs against each distribution in a minicpan
repository.  Given a program to run, for each distribution archive in the
repository, it will:

=over

=item *

extract the distribution archive to a temporary directory 

=item *

change to the temporary directory

=item *

execute the user-specified program

=item *

return to the original directory

=item *

clean up the temporary directory

=back

If no program to run is provided, C<<< visitcpan >>> will instead produce a listing of
distribution files, one per line, that can be piped to other programs for
analysis.

To avoid conflicts between C<<< visitcpan >>> options and arguments provided to
the program to run, use two dashes ('--') to separate minicpan options 
from other arguments.

By default, C<<< visitcpan >>> will use a local minicpan repository as defined 
in a .minicpanrc file. 

=head1 OPTIONS

  --append|-a        --append=dist -> append distname after ARGS
                     --append=path -> append tarball path after ARGS
 
  -e|-E              run next argument via 'perl -E'
 
  --help|-h          this usage info 
 
  --minicpan|-m      directory of a minicpan (defaults to local minicpan 
                     from CPAN::Mini config file)
 
  --output|-o        file to save output instead of sending to terminal
 
  --quiet|-q         silence warnings and suppress STDERR from tar
 
  --version|-V       visitcpan program version
 
  --                 indicates the end of options for visitcpan

=head1 EXAMPLES

   # count number of distributiosn in the minicpan
   $ visitcpan | wc -l
 
   # get a listing of all distributions using Build.PL
   $ visitcpan -q -a dist -o listing.txt -e 'say shift if -f "Build.PL"'
 
   # run a program against each distribution
   $ visitcpan -q -- ack -a 'use version;'

=head1 SEE ALSO

L<CPAN::Mini::Extract> creates a minicpan with archives extracted.  Analyzing
an extracted tree will be faster than C<<< visitcpan >>>, but the tree will take
up substantially more space on disk.
