NAME
    POE::Component::Client::LDAP - subclass of Net::LDAP which uses POE to
    speak via sockets in async mode.

SYNOPSIS
     use POE;
     use POE::Component::Client::LDAP;
 
     POE::Session->create(
            inline_states => {
                    _start => sub {
                            my ($heap, $session) = @_[HEAP, SESSION];
                            $heap->{ldap} = POE::Component::Client::LDAP->new(
                                    'localhost',
                                    callback => $session->postback( 'connect' ),
                            );
                    },
                    connect => sub {
                            my ($heap, $session, $callback_args) = @_[HEAP, SESSION, ARG1];
                            if ( $callback_args->[0] ) {
                                    $heap->{ldap}->bind(
                                            callback => $session->postback( 'bind' ),
                                    );
                            }
                            else {
                                    delete $heap->{ldap};
                                    print "Connection Failed\n";
                            }
                    },
                    bind => sub {
                            my ($heap, $session) = @_[HEAP, SESSION];
                            $heap->{ldap}->search(
                                    base => "ou=People,dc=domain,dc=net",
                                    filter => "(objectClass=person)",
                                    callback => $session->postback( 'search' ),
                            );
                    },
                    search => sub {
                            my ($heap, $ldap_return) = @_[HEAP, ARG1];
                            my $ldap_search = shift @$ldap_return;
 
                            foreach (@$ldap_return) {
                                    print $_->dump;
                            }
 
                            delete $heap->{ldap} if $ldap_search->done;
                    },
            },
     );
 
     POE::Kernel->run();

DESCRIPTION
    POE::Component::Client::LDAP->new() starts up a new POE::Session and
    POE::Wheel to manage socket communications for an underlying Net::LDAP
    object, allowing it to be used in async mode properly within a POE
    program.

INTERFACE DIFFERENCES
    With regards to Net::LDAP, all interfaces are to be used as documented,
    with the following exceptions.

    POE::Component::Client::LDAP->new( hostname, OPTIONS ) =item
    POE::Component::Client::LDAP->new( OPTIONS ) =item
    POE::Component::Client::LDAP->new()
      A call to new() is non-blocking, always returning an object.

      If a hostname is supplied, new() also acts as though you have called
      connect(). Please read the docs for connect() to see how the arguments
      work.

    $object->connect( hostname, OPTIONS ) =item $object->connect( OPTIONS )
    =item $object->connect()
      The 'callback' argument has been added and should always be supplied
      to notify your code when a connection is established.

      Only LDAP connections are supported at this time, LDAPS and LDAPI will
      be in a future release.

      Connection errors are not handled at this time, again in a future
      release.

      The 'async' option is always turned on, and whatever value you pass in
      will be ignored.

    $object->async()
      Async mode is always turned on and so this call will always return
      true, if you pass it a value to set it a fatal exception will be
      raised, even if value is true.

    $object->sync()
      Async mode is required, this call will cause a fatal exception.

    $object->sock()
      This call will throw a fatal exception.

      Because POE is being used to handle socket communications I have
      chosen to not expose the raw socket at this time.

CALLBACK SEMANTICS
    The callback semantics documented here are for reference, the callbacks
    are handled by Net::LDAP and I've only documented them for reference
    here. The exception to this is the callback for new() which does not
    exist in Net::LDAP, and thus I have defined myself.

    new =item connect
      No arguments are passed to indicate that an existing connection has
      been closed.

      The first argument is a boolean indicator of whether a connection has
      succeeded or failed. The second argument contains the host spec used
      to attempt the connection.

      In the case of a success the third and fourth arguments contain the
      address and port connected to respectively.

      In the case of a failure the third argument contains the name of the
      operation that failed, and the fourth and fifth arguments hold numeric
      and string values of $! respectively.

    search
      The first argument is always the Net::LDAP::Search object presiding
      over this search run. The 'done' method on this object may be
      consulted to know when all the possible replies have been received.

      The second and following arguments are Net::LDAP::Entry objects
      returned from the search.

    others
      Forthcoming

BUGS
    Failures of many kinds are not very well handled at this time, also
    canceling running connection requests is not implemented.
