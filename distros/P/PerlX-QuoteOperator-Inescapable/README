NAME
    PerlX::QuoteOperator::Inescapable - a quote-like operator with no string
    escapes

SYNOPSIS
            use PerlX::QuoteOperator::Inescapable;
        
            my $var1 = q(Hello World);   # standard Perl quote-like operator
            my $var2 = Q(Hello World);   # this works the same
        
            my $var3 = q(Hello\\World);  # string includes a backslash
            my $var4 = Q(Hello\\World);  # string includes two backslashes!

DESCRIPTION
    PerlX::QuoteOperator::Inescapable introduces a quote-like operator like
    `q(...)` but that supports no string escapes! All characters quoted are
    treated literally.

    Like other quote-like operators, standard left/right bracket pairs are
    supported; but unlike other quote-like operators, you cannot nest balanced
    pairs of brackets:

            Q(Hello (Earth) World);   # no!

    By default, a single quote-like operator is defined, `Q`. You can define
    alternative ones:

            use Path::Class;
            use PerlX::QuoteOperator::Inescapable
                    Q => (),   # default Q operator
                    F => sub ($) { Path::Class::File->new(@_) },
                    D => sub ($) { Path::Class::Dir->new(@_) },
            ;
        
            my $fonts = D!\\Server1\Marketing\Fonts!;

CAVEATS
    The current implementation is limited to single-line literals. The
    quote-like operator, starting delimiter and ending delimiter must all
    appear on the same line of source code.

BUGS
    The hash symbol (#) can not be used as a quote delimiter. ☹
