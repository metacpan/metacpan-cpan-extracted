Subtitles 
=========

Video files (avi, mpeg etc) are sometimes accompanied with subtitles, which are
currently very popular as text files. The command line tool 'subs' and its perl
backend Subtitles.pm provide means for simple loading, re-timing, converting,
and storing these subtitle files. The supported formats are .srt, .sub, .smi,
and .idx. An example of a GUI subtitle player is included.

USAGE
=====

Warning: -i is a great feature, but use it with certain caution.

If subtitles are shown too early ( 5 seconds):

   subs -i -b 5 file.sub

If subtitles are for a movie in 25 fps, need to be for 24
( actual for frame-based formats only ).

   subs -i -a 24/25 file.sub

If subtitles start 1 second too early, but in 1 hour are late in 7 seconds:

   subs -i -p 0 -1 -p 1:00:00 +7 file.sub

Join two parts with 15-second gap
  
    subs -o joined.sub -j 15 part1.sub part2.sub 

Split in two after 50 minutes and half a second ( makes basename.1.sub
and basename.2.sub ).

    subs -o basename.sub -s 50:00.5 toobig.sub

Remove closed caption-specific comments such as '[Sneezing]' or '[Music playing]'

    subs -e 's/[\s-]*\[.*\]\s*\n*//gs' sub.sub

Separate overlapped lines

    subs -O subs.sub

Zip two subtitles together -- read time information from one, text from another

    subs -z time.sub text.sub
