Chart-Scientific version 0.16
==============================

Chart::Scientific is a simple PDL-based plotter.  2-D plots can be easily
made from data in an array or PDL, or from a file containing columns of data.
The columns can be delimited with any character(s) or regular expression.

There are many plotting options:

Graph axes can be logged (non-finite data, i.e. negative data that is logged,
will be ignored, with a warning), error bars can be plotted, the axes can be
displayed, residuals can be plotted, font, line thickness, character size, plot
point style, and colors can all be adjusted, line or point plotting, or both,
can be supressed.  Labels can be written on either axis, and the x and y ranges
can be specified.
