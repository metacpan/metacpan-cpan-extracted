Compellent-CompCU version 0.06
====================================

Compellent::CompCU provides a Perl wrapper around Compellent's command line tool.
The Compellent command line tool is distributed in the jar file CompCU.jar. 
Consequently, you must have Java and the CompCU.jar file in order for this to work.

Please consider this to be beta software. Send any bugs, comments, or questions 
to me directly at ac.russell@live.com.
