NAME
    DBIx::Class::DeploymentHandler - Extensible DBIx::Class deployment

SYNOPSIS
     use aliased 'DBIx::Class::DeploymentHandler' => 'DH';
     my $s = My::Schema->connect(...);

     my $dh = DH->new({
       schema              => $s,
       databases           => 'SQLite',
       sql_translator_args => { add_drop_table => 0 },
     });

     $dh->prepare_install;

     $dh->install;

    or for upgrades:

     use aliased 'DBIx::Class::DeploymentHandler' => 'DH';
     my $s = My::Schema->connect(...);

     my $dh = DH->new({
       schema              => $s,
       databases           => 'SQLite',
       sql_translator_args => { add_drop_table => 0 },
     });

     $dh->prepare_deploy;
     $dh->prepare_upgrade({
       from_version => 1,
       to_version   => 2,
     });

     $dh->upgrade;

DESCRIPTION
    "DBIx::Class::DeploymentHandler" is, as its name suggests, a tool for
    deploying and upgrading databases with DBIx::Class. It is designed to be
    much more flexible than DBIx::Class::Schema::Versioned, hence the use of
    Moose and lots of roles.

    "DBIx::Class::DeploymentHandler" itself is just a recommended set of
    roles that we think will not only work well for everyone, but will also
    yield the best overall mileage. Each role it uses has its own nuances
    and documentation, so I won't describe all of them here, but here are a
    few of the major benefits over how DBIx::Class::Schema::Versioned worked
    (and DBIx::Class::DeploymentHandler::Deprecated tries to maintain
    compatibility with):

    *   Downgrades in addition to upgrades.

    *   Multiple sql files files per upgrade/downgrade/install.

    *   Perl scripts allowed for upgrade/downgrade/install.

    *   Just one set of files needed for upgrade, unlike before where one
        might need to generate "factorial(scalar @versions)", which is just
        silly.

    *   And much, much more!

    That's really just a taste of some of the differences. Check out each
    role for all the details.

WHERE IS ALL THE DOC?!
    To get up and running fast, your best place to start is
    DBIx::Class::DeploymentHandler::Manual::Intro and then
    DBIx::Class::DeploymentHandler::Manual::CatalystIntro if your intending
    on using this with Catalyst.

    For the full story you should realise that
    "DBIx::Class::DeploymentHandler" extends
    DBIx::Class::DeploymentHandler::Dad, so that's probably the first place
    to look when you are trying to figure out how everything works.

    Next would be to look at all the pieces that fill in the blanks that
    DBIx::Class::DeploymentHandler::Dad expects to be filled. They would be
    DBIx::Class::DeploymentHandler::DeployMethod::SQL::Translator,
    DBIx::Class::DeploymentHandler::VersionHandler::Monotonic,
    DBIx::Class::DeploymentHandler::VersionStorage::Standard, and
    DBIx::Class::DeploymentHandler::WithReasonableDefaults.

WHY IS THIS SO WEIRD
    "DBIx::Class::DeploymentHandler" has a strange structure. The gist is
    that it delegates to three small objects that are proxied to via
    interface roles that then create the illusion of one large, monolithic
    object. Here is a diagram that might help:

    The nice thing about this is that we have well defined interfaces for
    the objects that comprise the "DeploymentHandler", the smaller objects
    can be tested in isolation, and the smaller objects can even be swapped
    in easily. But the real win is that you can subclass the
    "DeploymentHandler" without knowing about the underlying delegation; you
    just treat it like normal Perl and write methods that do what you want.

THIS SUCKS
    You started your project and weren't using
    "DBIx::Class::DeploymentHandler"? Lucky for you I had you in mind when I
    wrote this doc.

    First, define the version in your main schema file (maybe using
    $VERSION).

    Then you'll want to just install the version_storage:

     my $s = My::Schema->connect(...);
     my $dh = DBIx::Class::DeploymentHandler->new({ schema => $s });

     $dh->prepare_version_storage_install;
     $dh->install_version_storage;

    Then set your database version:

     $dh->add_database_version({ version => $s->schema_version });

    Now you should be able to use "DBIx::Class::DeploymentHandler" like
    normal!

LOGGING
    This is a complex tool, and because of that sometimes you'll want to see
    what exactly is happening. The best way to do that is to use the built
    in logging functionality. It the standard six log levels; "fatal",
    "error", "warn", "info", "debug", and "trace". Most of those are pretty
    self explanatory. Generally a safe level to see what all is going on is
    debug, which will give you everything except for the exact SQL being
    run.

    To enable the various logging levels all you need to do is set an
    environment variables: "DBICDH_FATAL", "DBICDH_ERROR", "DBICDH_WARN",
    "DBICDH_INFO", "DBICDH_DEBUG", and "DBICDH_TRACE". Each level can be set
    on its own, but the default is the first three on and the last three
    off, and the levels cascade, so if you turn on trace the rest will turn
    on automatically.

DONATIONS
    If you'd like to thank me for the work I've done on this module, don't
    give me a donation. I spend a lot of free time creating free software,
    but I do it because I love it.

    Instead, consider donating to someone who might actually need it.
    Obviously you should do research when donating to a charity, so don't
    just take my word on this. I like Matthew 25: Ministries:
    <http://www.m25m.org/>, but there are a host of other charities that can
    do much more good than I will with your money. (Third party charity info

METHODS
  prepare_version_storage_install

    First prepare all the tables to be installed and the prepare just the
    version storage

  install_version_storage
     $dh->install_version_storage
