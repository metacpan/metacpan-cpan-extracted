Tk-TipEntry
========================

This widget is derived from L<Tk::Entry>. It implements an other kind of
tooltip, that is displayed inside the entry when it's empty.
The tooltip will be removed, if the entry gets the focus and reinserted, if
the entry loses the focus and it's value is empty (C<$entry->get() eq ''>).

In addition, the entry evaluates the escape-key. If the entry has the focus
and the escape-key is pressed, the original input will be restored. If there
is no previous input, the tooltip will be displayed again.
