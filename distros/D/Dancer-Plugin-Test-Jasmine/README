NAME
    Dancer::Plugin::Test::Jasmine - Inject and run Jasmine tests in your web
    pages

VERSION
    version 0.2.0

SYNOPSIS
    In config.yml:

        plugins:
            'Test::Jasmine':
                specs_dir: t/specs
                prefix: /test
                lib_dir: /path/to/jasmine/dir
                additional_scripts:
                    - /uri/to/script.js
                additional_css:
                    - /usr/to/other.css

    In application:

        package MyApp;

        use Dancer;

        use if $ENV{DANCER_ENVIRONMENT} eq 'development', 
            'Dancer::Plugin::Test::Jasmine';

        ...;

DESCRIPTION
    This plugin helps running Jasmine <http://jasmine.github.io> tests for
    your Dancer application.

    If the plugin is enabled, a request with queries having one or more
    "test" fields will make the application inject the Jasmine library and
    the tests in the response (if no "test" parameter is present, the
    response is left untouched). The library is injected at the end of the
    head section of the page, and the tests at the end of its body.

    To incorporate those tests to your Perl test suites, see
    Dancer::Plugin::Test::Jasmine::Results.

    In addition to Jasmine itself, this plugin also load jasmine-jquery
    <https://github.com/velesin/jasmine-jquery>.

CONFIGURATION PARAMETERS
    specs_dir
        The directory where the Jasmine tests are to be found. Defauls to
        "t/specs".

    prefix
        The uri prefix under which the Jasmine library and the Jasmine specs
        files will be available . Defaults to "/test".

    lib_dir
        By default the plugin uses a version of Jasmine and its JSON
        reporter bundled in its share folder. If you prefer to use your own
        version of Jasmine, you can specify its directory via this
        parameter.

    additional_scripts
    additional_css
        If specified, the plugin will include those scripts and css files in
        addition of (and after) the Jasmine stuff. The paths are just the
        straight uris where to find those files.

        For example, to test an Angular application one can add:

            plugins:
                Test::Jasmine:
                    additional_scripts:
                        - /js/angular-mocks.js

RUNNING TESTS AS PART OF PERL TEST SUITES
    Obviously, the tests need to be run from within a browser with a
    JavaScript engine. But if you desire to have the tests included in your
    regular test suites, there are several test modules allowing
    interactions (Test::WWW::Selenium, WWW::Mechanize::PhantomJS) with
    browsers.

    In addition of the regular HTML report, the Jasmine test results are
    also accessible via the JavaScipt function
    "jasmine.getJSReportAsString()", thanks to the Jasmine-jsreporter
    <https://github.com/detro/jasmine-jsreporter> plugin. The module
    Dancer::Plugin::Test::Jasmine::Results provides a helper function
    "jasmine_results" that takes in the Jasmine results, and produce
    equivalent TAP output.

  WWW::Mechanize::PhantomJS
    For example, if we wanted to run the test 't/specs/verify_title.js' via
    PhantomJS, we could use:

        use strict;
        use warnings;

        use Test::More;

        use JSON qw/ from_json /;

        use Test::TCP;
        use WWW::Mechanize::PhantomJS;

        use Dancer::Plugin::Test::Jasmine::Results;

        Test::TCP::test_tcp(
            client => sub {
                my $port = shift;

                my $mech = WWW::Mechanize::PhantomJS->new;

                $mech->get("http://localhost:$port?test=verify_title");

                jasmine_results from_json
                    $mech->eval_in_page('jasmine.getJSReportAsString()'; 
            },
            server => sub {
                my $port = shift;

                use Dancer;
                use MyApp;
                Dancer::Config->load;

                set( startup_info => 0,  port => $port );
                Dancer->dance;
            },
        );

        done_testing;
