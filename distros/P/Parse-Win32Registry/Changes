Revision history for Perl extension Parse::Win32Registry.

** 1.0 2012-04-29

Added support for decoding System Mandatory Label ACEs (a feature
introduced with Windows Vista) and added the command line script
regml.pl for listing keys with explicit System Mandatory Label ACEs
set. Improved handling of security descriptors.

Tidied up various aspects of the wxWidgets and GTK applications, and
harmonised functionality between the various pairs of equivalent
programs, with a minor difference being the wxWidgets applications
following Windows keyboard shortcut conventions while the GTK
applications following Linux keyboard shortcut conventions.

The get_data method of Value objects now returns the unpacked integer
value for REG_DWORD_BIG_ENDIAN value types instead of the original
packed binary data.

Added support for values with 'big data'. Thanks to Harlan Carvey for
all his help with this.

** 0.60 2010-08-15

Parse::Win32Registry now requires Perl 5.8.1.

Implemented new RGKN and RGDB Block objects for Windows 95 registry
files. Now both Windows 95 and Windows NT registry files have
a get_block_iterator method, which replaces the get_hbin_iterator
previously provided for Windows NT registry files. (For backwards
compatibility, calling the get_hbin_iterator method will call the
get_block_iterator method.)

Some performance improvements have been made to the processing of
REG_MULTI_SZ value data (in the get_data method of Value objects), to
the generation of hexdumps (in the hexdump function and the unparsed
method of Entry objects), and to the generation of REGEDIT-style octet
strings (in the as_regedit_export method of Value objects).

Uncompressed (Unicode) key and value names are now correctly read
from Windows NT registry files.

The following new scripts have been added: wxregcompare.pl,
wxregscope.pl, and wxregview.pl. The existing regcompare.pl,
regscope.pl, and regview.pl scripts have been renamed to
gtkregcompare.pl, gtkregscope.pl, and gtkregview.pl respectively.
The wx scripts require Mattia Barbon's wxPerl library and the gtk
scripts require Gtk-Perl. (Binary versions of wxPerl are currently
available in ActivePerl.)

gtkregscope.pl and wxregscope.pl use the new get_block_iterator
method, so can read both Windows 95 or Windows NT registry files.

gtkregcompare.pl and wxregcompare.pl allow the Select Files dialog
to be cancelled to make it possible to review the currently selected files.

regmultidiff.pl now displays changes in a summary mode.
The previous format is available by specifying the -l or --long option.

** 0.51 2009-10-04

Added new regscope.pl script, a GTK+ registry entry viewer that uses color
to highlight different types of registry entries.

Documented the get_name method of SID objects and the get_value_data
method of Key objects. The as_string method of the ACE object and the
as_stanza method of the SecurityDescriptor object now include the well
known SID names (as returned by each SID object's get_name method).

Updated the regview.pl and regcompare.pl scripts: regview.pl and
regcompare.pl can now select keys and/or values when searching,
regview.pl can now sort columns (e.g. keys can be sorted by timestamp,
values by type, etc), regcompare.pl can now bookmark keys or values,
and regview.pl now has a basic report view.

Fixed the get_subtree_iter and make_multiple_subtree_iterator methods
to return the root key(s) of the subtree(s) as the documentation
indicates. regview.pl, regmultidiff.pl, and regcompare.pl amended to
accommodate these changes.

Fixed redisplay problem closing dialogs using Escape in regview.pl and
regcompare.pl.

Makefile.pl now includes all scripts as exe_files.

** 0.50 2009-07-19

Security information is now extracted from Windows NT registry files.
Key objects now provide a get_security method which returns a new
Security object. The various methods of a Security object will return
Security Descriptor, ACL, ACE, and SID objects.

The support functions unpack_sid, unpack_ace, unpack_acl, and
unpack_security_descriptor have been added to allow the manual
extraction of security information from value data.

The support functions compare_multiple_keys and compare_multiple_values
have been added for comparing keys and values.

Updated scripts: regview.pl now provides searches and displays
security information for keys. regtree.pl now draws lines connecting
subkeys to their parent keys. regdump.pl can now display class names
and security information. regfind.pl and regtimeline.pl can now
display value data as a hexdump, and regfind.pl now searches raw data
for unicode matches.

New scripts: regmultidiff.pl is a command line program for comparing
multiple registry files, and replaces regdiff.pl. regcompare.pl is a
GTK+ Registry Compare program, and also provides searches.
regsecurity.pl displays registry security entries. regshell.pl is a
interactive console program for browsing registry files that offers
tab completion of key and value names if Term::Readline is available.

Iterators for processing keys and values have now been added,
mainly to support GUI programs (see regview.pl and regcompare.pl).
Key objects now offer the get_subkey_iterator, get_value_iterator,
and get_subtree_iterator methods.

The support functions make_multiple_subkey_iterator,
make_multiple_value_iterator, and make_multiple_subtree_iterator have
been added for processing multiple registry files simultaneously.

Similarly, iterators have been added for scanning registry files entry
by entry. The new Hbin object has been created to represent the
individual hbins that make up Windows NT registry files. Now you can
either iterate through all the entries in a registry file, or iterate
through all the hbins in a registry file and through each entry of
each hbin.

The as_hexdump method provided by Entry, Key, and Value objects
has been renamed to unparsed to more accurately reflect what it shows.

The Entry, Key, and Value objects now provide the following methods:
get_length, get_tag, is_allocated, get_raw_bytes, looks_like_key,
looks_like_value, and looks_like_security.

Warnings generated by parse errors are now disabled by default.

** 0.41 2008-12-14

Added the new get_class_name function for Windows NT registry keys.
Added the regclassnames.pl script to demonstrate finding keys that
have class names, and updated regview.pl to display the timestamp
and class names of keys in additional columns.

** 0.40 2008-09-28

Added new scripts: regexport.pl for exporting keys and values using
the Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00 format, regscan.pl for
dumping all the entries in a registry file, regstats.pl for providing
basic statistics, regtimeline.pl for listing keys and values in date
order, regtree.pl for dumping a registry file as an intended tree, and
regview.pl, a GTK+ Registry Viewer. Updated regdump.pl and regfind.pl
to provide new options.

Changed parse errors to generate warnings instead of croaking.
Documented this in the Handling Invalid Data section.

The get_data method of Value objects now handles REG_MULTI_SZ data by
returning a list of its elements in an array context, and a string in
a scalar context. The output of get_data_as_string is unaffected.

Added new Registry object methods: get_virtual_root_key,
get_timestamp, get_timestamp_as_string, and get_embedded_filename.

Added new Key object methods: as_regedit_export, get_parent, and
is_root.

Added new Value object methods: as_regedit_export, and get_raw_data.

Added the get_next_entry and move_to_first_entry methods to the
Registry object for iterating through all the entries in a registry
file. Added the Entry object class as a generic object to represent
these entries.

Added the methods parse_info and as_hexdump to
Entry, Key, and Value objects.

Support function convert_filetime_to_epoch_time renamed to
unpack_windows_time, added the function unpack_unicode_string, and
documented hexdump.

** 0.30 2007-07-01

Added two new scripts: regfind.pl for searching keys, values, and data
for a search string, and regdiff.pl for comparing two registry files
and displaying the differences. dumpreg.pl renamed to regdump.pl and
command line options simplified.

Introduced the as_string method for Key and Value objects. This is
intended to be a more usable replacement for the print_summary
method.

The get_data_as_string method changed to return REG_DWORD values as a
hexadecimal number followed by its decimal equivalent. Clarified that
REG_DWORD values are returned as unsigned integers.

Support functions convert_filetime_to_epoch_time and iso8601
documented.

Fixed bugs handling unusual key names in the get_subkey method.

** 0.25 2006-11-12

Fixed a bug with new WinNT key objects incorrectly setting the offsets
to subkey lists and value lists when the offset to the parent key had
a particular value.

** 0.24 2006-10-29

Key objects now have a get_path method, which returns the path
to that key from the root key of a registry file. Documentation
updated to describe the new method.

dumpreg.pl updated to use get_path. Dropped the prefix_pattern and
long_prefix_pattern configuration options from Getopt::Long.
(which required an unnecessarily recent version of Getopt::Long)

** 0.23 2006-08-13

Key objects now have the get_timestamp and get_timestamp_as_string
methods, although only Windows NT registry keys will return valid
values. print_summary nows also displays the timestamp for Windows NT
registry keys. Documentation updated to reflect this.

Makefile.PL now installs the dumpreg.pl script.

** 0.22 2006-08-06

Included the script dumpreg.pl as both a tool for examining
registry files, and as an example.

Offsets that require adjustment by fixed amounts (this applies to
entries in the RGKN block of Windows 95 registry files and to all
entries in the hbin blocks of Windows NT registry files) are now
amended before being stored, rather than at seek time.

Troubleshooting section added to the documentation.

** 0.21 2006-07-30

Checks added after every sysread, and improvements attempted for the
error messages presented. Internal error messages have been made
distinct from parse errors.

The code that looks up the RGDB entry for Win95 keys has been revised
to remove some duplicate code. It's still too long.

Reading REG_DWORD values which are not the expected four bytes in
length no longer results in an exception. get_data now
returns undef for these values instead of failing.

get_data_as_string updated to return (no data) when get_data returns
an empty string, and (invalid data) when get_data returns undef (which
should only occur for invalid REG_DWORD values).

** 0.20 2006-07-23

Released to CPAN.
