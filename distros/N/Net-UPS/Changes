Revision history for Perl module Net::UPS
==============================================

0.16 2015-06-27
   * thanks to KENTNL for opening RT #105214 and helping me find the
     culprit of the encoding problems: XML::SAX::PurePerl requires
     character strings in input
   * removed encoding test

0.15 2015-02-24
   * always 'use' IO::Socket::SSL (prevents errors relating to the
     Net::SSLeay::OP_NO_* constants)
   * add test to figure out encoding problems

0.14 2015-02-03
   * allow setting custom SSL options and custom user agent
   * manually include the root certificate for UPS's servers in the
     default SSL options

0.13 2014-09-01
   * incorporate patch from RT #98219, in case AddressKeyFormat is
     returned multiple times

     thanks to perl@xev.net for the code
