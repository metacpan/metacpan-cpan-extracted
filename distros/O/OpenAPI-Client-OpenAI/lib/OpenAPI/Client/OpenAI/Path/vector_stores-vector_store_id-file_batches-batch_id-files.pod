=head3 Parameters

=over 4

=item * C<vector_store_id> (in path) (Required) - The ID of the vector store that the files belong to.

Type: C<string>



=item * C<batch_id> (in path) (Required) - The ID of the file batch that the files belong to.

Type: C<string>



=item * C<limit> (in query) (Optional) - A limit on the number of objects to be returned. Limit can range between 1 and 100, and the default is 20.


Type: C<integer>


Default: C<20>


=item * C<order> (in query) (Optional) - Sort order by the `created_at` timestamp of the objects. `asc` for ascending order and `desc` for descending order.


Type: C<string>

Allowed values: C<asc, desc>


Default: C<desc>


=item * C<after> (in query) (Optional) - A cursor for use in pagination. `after` is an object ID that defines your place in the list. For instance, if you make a list request and receive 100 objects, ending with obj_foo, your subsequent call can include after=obj_foo in order to fetch the next page of the list.


Type: C<string>



=item * C<before> (in query) (Optional) - A cursor for use in pagination. `before` is an object ID that defines your place in the list. For instance, if you make a list request and receive 100 objects, starting with obj_foo, your subsequent call can include before=obj_foo in order to fetch the previous page of the list.
