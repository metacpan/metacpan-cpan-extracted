1.22:	Records created by Crypt::PWSafe3 (eg. the ones fetched
	with getrecords) are now associated with the parent
	object, so that you can modify them directly and call
	$vault->save afterwards without using $vault->modifyrecord.

        Erase passwd from memory using zeros instead of
        random bytes. fixes github#9.

	Fixed rt.cpan.org#112975: Crypt::ECB (which we use) have been
	reworked and among other issues it fixed handline of padding.
	PWSafe3.pm did not specify a padding scheme (because it doesn't
	use it) and therefore Crypt::ECB enforced a default scheme
	which lead to an invalid key size. Now we specify explicitly
	padding:none, as suggested by Christoph Appel.

1.21:
	forgot to load File::Spec

1.20:
	applied another patch by David Dick: writing tmp files in
	the same directory where the vault file resides (unless it's
	not writable).

1.19:
	applied patch by David Dick, which adds some more precautions
	of i/o error handling and flushing.

1.17:
	added license to META

	open tmpfiles with O_EXLOCK disabled (cpantesters)

	added new parameter 'create', enabled by default,
	which creates a new vault if enabled and dies otherwise.

	enhanced unit tests to report if read/write of files fails.

	added unit test to create a new vault

	added POD for newrecord() and addrecord(), previously
	missing.

	replaced "new $perl::$object" with $perl::$object->new()
	everywhere.

	using weak random source for unit tests to avoid blocking
	/dev/random on cpantesters systems with heavy entropy
	load.

1.16
	re-licensed from artistic1 to artistic2 in order to be
	compatible to fedora packaging. no code changes otherwise

1.15
	fixed github#8, using File::Temp instead of self baked
	File::Spec.

1.14
	fixed github#7: added PasswordPolicy.pm to MANIFEST.

1.13
	added Crypt::PWSafe3::PasswordPolicy submodule, which allows
	to access the password policy of a PasswordSafe record.

1.12
	I somehow managed to mangle version numbers of sub modules,
	now all properly incremented.

1.11
	fixed:
	https://github.com/TLINDEN/Crypt--PWSafe3/issues/6
	https://github.com/TLINDEN/Crypt--PWSafe3/issues/5
	This was NOT caused by polish characters, but by the
	password expire field being set (I didn't use it so far
	and my test database doesn't contain records with this
	field set). The 'W<*' pack identifier had been used
	for this field and W doesn't support < indeed. I changed
	it to use 'S<' now, which is a 2 byte little endian
	value according to the db-spec. I also edited the
	test database so that it contains the field now, so that
	a make test catches it.

	fixed cpantester problem with taintmode unlink() call,
	now $tmpfile is untainted before

1.10
	I forgot to fix the pack() format as well.

1.09
	the unpack() formatstring for the uuid (field 0x01) "L<4" didn't
	return a hex string, but a number only, which is fine for most
	cases, but isn't a correct Data::UUID representation. Changed back
	to "H*".

1.08
	fixed pack/unpack formats to use strictly little-endian values as required.
	machine-dependend unpack() formats changed to machine-independend.

1.07
	applied patch by  https://github.com/Mekk:
	https://github.com/TLINDEN/Crypt--PWSafe3/pull/3,
	fix import of Bytes::Random::Secure.

1.06
	applied patch by  https://github.com/Mekk:
	https://github.com/TLINDEN/Crypt--PWSafe3/pull/2,
	adds new function "deleterecord()", improves performance
	when using Bytes::Random::Secure[now optional] and fixes
	an error in ::Record::addfield().

1.05
	applied patch by https://github.com/Mekk:
	https://github.com/TLINDEN/Crypt--PWSafe3/pull/1,
	which replaces use of cp and mv commands with File::Copy.
	this makes it portable.

1.04

	fixed rt.cpan.org#75145. uninitialized fields lead to
        program abort. solved by pre-initializing them in the
        new records method. types notes and groups affected.

	fixed rt.cpan.org#75146. mtime will only modified if
	the passwd field changed. POD adjusted. Fix suggested
	by Luca Filipozzi - thx.


1.03
	after saving we do not mv the tmp file but copying
	it, because mv sometimes doesn't work with files the
	current user is not the owner but has write permissions
	while cp works on such files. so now we cp and unlink
	the tmpfile after saving.


1.02
	doc fix in ::Record (group separator is . not /)
	added Shell.pm to Makefile.PL dependencies


1.01
	bug fix in t/run.t


1.00
	initial version
