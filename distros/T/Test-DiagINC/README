NAME
    Test::DiagINC - List modules and versions loaded if tests fail

VERSION
    version 0.006

SYNOPSIS
        # preferably load before anything else
        use if $ENV{AUTOMATED_TESTING}, 'Test::DiagINC';
        use Test::More;

DESCRIPTION
    Assuming you shipped your module to CPAN with working tests, test
    failures from CPAN Testers <http://www.cpantesters.org/> might be due to
    platform issues, Perl version issues or problems with dependencies. This
    module helps you diagnose deep dependency problems by showing you
    exactly what modules and versions were loaded during a test run.

    When this module is loaded, it sets up an "END" block that will take
    action if the program is about to exit with a non-zero exit code or if
    $test_builder->is_passing is false by the time the "END" block is
    reached. If that happens, this module prints out the names and version
    numbers of non-local modules appearing in %INC at the end of the test.

    For example:

        $ perl -MTest::DiagINC -MTest::More -e 'fail("meh"); done_testing'
        not ok 1 - meh
        #   Failed test 'meh'
        #   at -e line 1.
        1..1
        # Looks like you failed 1 test of 1.
        # Listing modules and versions from %INC
        #   5.018002 Config
        #       5.68 Exporter
        #       5.68 Exporter::Heavy
        #       1.07 PerlIO
        #       0.98 Test::Builder
        #       0.98 Test::Builder::Module
        #      0.003 Test::DiagINC
        #       0.98 Test::More
        #       1.22 overload
        #       0.02 overloading
        #       1.07 strict
        #       1.03 vars
        #       1.18 warnings
        #       1.02 warnings::register

    This module deliberately does not load any other modules during runtime,
    instead delaying all loads until it needs to generate a failure report
    in its "END" block. The only exception is loading strict and warnings
    for self-check if and only if "RELEASE_TESTING" is true. Therefore an
    empty invocation will look like this:

        $ perl -MTest::DiagINC -e 'exit(1)'
        # Listing modules from %INC
        #  0.003 Test::DiagINC

    NOTE: Because this module uses an "END" block, it is a good idea to load
    it as early as possible, so the "END" block it installs will execute as
    late as possible (see perlmod for details on how this works). While this
    module does employ some cleverness to work around load order, it is
    still a heuristic and is no substitute to loading this module early. A
    notable side-effect is when a module is loaded in an "END" block
    executing after the one installed by this library: such modules will be
    "invisible" to us and will not be reported as part of the diagnostic
    report.

    Modules that appear to be sourced from below the current directory when
    "Test::DiagINC" was loaded will be excluded from the report (e.g.
    excludes local modules from "./", "lib/", "t/lib", and so on).

    The heuristic of searching %INC for loaded modules may fail if the
    module path loaded does not map to a package within the module file.

    If "Test::More" is loaded, the output will go via the "diag" function.
    Otherwise, it will just be sent to STDERR.
