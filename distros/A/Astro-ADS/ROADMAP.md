# Roadmap for Astro::ADS v2.0

## v1.95 - targeted for the end of 2025

These APIs will be implemented as they are the ones documented in
[adsabs-dev-api](https://github.com/adsabs/adsabs-dev-api)

* Search
* Metrics
* Export
* Libraries
* Journals

No official announcment has been made yet, so the interfaces are still
flexible and may be liable to change.

## v2.0 - public release in 2026

By this point, we should stop and look at the interfaces
and make them intuitive and consistent with the other clients.
I should have 5 more APIs ready by then, so there will be
plenty to discuss with the ADS dev team.
