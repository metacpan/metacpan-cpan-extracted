This is Anarchie.pm 1.5, a Perl interface to Anarchie 2.01+, a popular
Mac OS FTP client.

REQUIREMENTS:
*MacPerl 5.1.4r4+
*Anarchie 2.01+ or a compatible version of Fetch.
*Mac::Apps::Launch
*You might have to give MacPerl an extra meg of memory, I've had some
    problems with it quitting out on me.

This archive can always be obtained from:

    http://pudge.net/macperl/
    http://perl.com/CPAN/authors/id/CNANDOR/
    http://perl.com/CPAN/modules/by-module/Mac/

The file is a tarred, gzipped file.  Use Stuffit Expander or a
similar program to get at the archive.

Please let me know how well it does(n't) work, and any changes you'd 
like to see.
