=head1 NAME

KinoSearch::Analysis::Stemmer - Reduce related words to a shared root.

=head1 DEPRECATED

The KinoSearch code base has been assimilated by the Apache L<Lucy> project.
The "KinoSearch" namespace has been deprecated, but development continues
under our new name at our new home: L<http://lucy.apache.org/>

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $stemmer = KinoSearch::Analysis::Stemmer->new( language => 'es' );
    
    my $polyanalyzer = KinoSearch::Analysis::PolyAnalyzer->new(
        analyzers => [ $case_folder, $tokenizer, $stemmer ],
    );

This class is a wrapper around L<Lingua::Stem::Snowball>, so it supports the
same languages.  



=head1 DESCRIPTION

Stemmer is an L<Analyzer|KinoSearch::Analysis::Analyzer> which reduces
related words to a root form (using the "Snowball" stemming library).  For
instance, "horse", "horses", and "horsing" all become "hors" -- so that a
search for 'horse' will also match documents containing 'horses' and
'horsing'.
