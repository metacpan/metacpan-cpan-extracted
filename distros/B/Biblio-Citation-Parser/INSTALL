Installing Biblio::Citation::Parser
===================================

The easiest way to do this is like so:

perl Build.PL
./Build
./Build install

You can also optionally run './Build test', which will run a few checks on
the modules.

Requirements
============

The following modules are required for Biblio::Citation::Parser to function correctly:

- URI
- Text::Unidecode 

The most recent versions of these are located at http://www.cpan.org. 

To use the web service support, you will need the SOAP::Lite module
(and any dependencies that it requires). Known working versions
are available at http://paracite.eprints.org/files/perlmods/soap/, while the
latest versions are at http://www.cpan.org.
