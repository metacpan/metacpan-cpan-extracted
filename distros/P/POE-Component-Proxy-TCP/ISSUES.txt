* should PoCos explicitly reveal and discuss their session architecture
  in documentation, and perhaps specify which callbacks are called in what
  session context, and what heap variables are available to the callbacks?

* should there we ways to look to the event queues and see if any sessions have events
  waiting to run future. This would have simplified the shutdown logic in the
  TestServer component.

* Should the be standard ways for Pocos to give users ways to set up 
  handlers in nested sessions and to pass state data down to handlers?
  
* Should there be standard error and tracing procedures for POE? Maybe something
   that runs with a console/ps type utility?
