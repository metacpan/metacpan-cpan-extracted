=head1 NAME

OODoc::Text::Structure - set of paragraphs with examples and subroutines

=head1 INHERITANCE

 OODoc::Text::Structure
   is an OODoc::Text
   is an OODoc::Object

 OODoc::Text::Structure is extended by
   OODoc::Text::Chapter
   OODoc::Text::Section
   OODoc::Text::SubSection
   OODoc::Text::SubSubSection

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  # Cannot be instantiated itself

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The L<OODoc::Text::Structure|OODoc::Text::Structure> class is used as base class for
the L<OODoc::Text::Chapter|OODoc::Text::Chapter>, L<OODoc::Text::Section|OODoc::Text::Section>, and
L<OODoc::Text::SubSection|OODoc::Text::SubSection> classes.  Each of these classes group some
paragraphs of text, probably some examples and some subroutines: they
provide a structure to the document.

Extends L<"DESCRIPTION" in OODoc::Text|OODoc::Text/"DESCRIPTION">.

=head1 OVERLOADED

Extends L<"OVERLOADED" in OODoc::Text|OODoc::Text/"OVERLOADED">.

=item $obj-E<gt>B<emptyExtension>($container)

Create an I<empty> copy of a structured text element, which is used
at a higher level of inheritance to collect related subroutines and
such.

=item $class-E<gt>B<new>(%options)

Inherited, see L<OODoc::Object/"Constructors">

=item container => OBJECT

=item description => STRING

=item level => INTEGER

Header level of the text structure.  A chapter will be 1, section 2, and
subsection 3.

=item name => STRING

=item type => STRING

=item $obj-E<gt>B<extends>( [$object] )

=item $obj-E<gt>B<level>()

Returns the level of the text structure.  Like in pod and html, a chapter
will be 1, section 2, and subsection 3.

=item $obj-E<gt>B<linenr>()

Inherited, see L<OODoc::Text/"Attributes">

=item $obj-E<gt>B<manual>()

Inherited, see L<OODoc::Object/"Attributes">

=item $obj-E<gt>B<name>()

Inherited, see L<OODoc::Text/"Attributes">

=item $obj-E<gt>B<niceName>()

Returns the name of this chapter, section or sub-section beautified to
normal caps.  If the name does not contain lower-case characters, then
the whole string is lower-cased, and then the first upper-cased.

=item $obj-E<gt>B<type>()

=head2 Location

=over 4

=item $obj-E<gt>B<findEntry>($name)

Find the chapter, section or subsection with this C<$name>.  The object found
is returned.

=item $obj-E<gt>B<path>()

Represent the location of this chapter, section, or subsection as
one string, separated by slashes.

» example: path expression

  print $subsect->path;
  # may print:  METHODS/Container/Search

=head2 Collected

Extends L<"Collected" in OODoc::Text|OODoc::Text/"Collected">.

=over 4

=item $obj-E<gt>B<addExample>($object)

Inherited, see L<OODoc::Text/"Collected">

=item $obj-E<gt>B<all>($method, \%parameters)

Call the C<$method> recursively on this object and all its sub-structures.
For instance, when called on a chapter, it first will call the C<$method> on
that chapter, than on all its sections, subsections, and subsubsections.
The C<%parameters> are passed with each call.  The results of all calls is
returned as LIST.

=item $obj-E<gt>B<examples>()

Inherited, see L<OODoc::Text/"Collected">

=item $obj-E<gt>B<findDescriptionObject>()

Inherited, see L<OODoc::Text/"Collected">

=item $obj-E<gt>B<isEmpty>()

Returns C<true> if this text structure is only a place holder for
something found in a super class.  Structured elements are created with
L<emptyExtension()|OODoc::Text::Structure/"Constructors"> on each sub-class pass the idea of order and to
collect subroutines to be listed.  However, in some cases, nothing is
to be listed after all, and in that case, this method returns C<true>.

» example: 

  unless($chapter->isEmpty) ...

=item $obj-E<gt>B<openDescription>()

=item $obj-E<gt>B<publish>(\%options)

=head2 Subroutines

Each manual page structure element (chapter, section, subsection, and
subsubsection) can contain a list of subroutine descriptions.

=over 4

=item $obj-E<gt>B<addSubroutine>($file, @objects)

One or more subroutines (L<OODoc::Text::Subroutine|OODoc::Text::Subroutine> C<@objects>) are added to the
chapter, section, subsection, or subsubsection.

=item $obj-E<gt>B<setSubroutines>(\@subs)

Sets the subroutines which are related to this text structure, replacing
the preivous set.  This is used when the manual pages are expanded into
each-other to simplify working with the inheritance relations.

=item $obj-E<gt>B<subroutine>($name)

Returns the subroutine with the specific name.

=item $obj-E<gt>B<subroutines>()

Returns the list of subroutines which are related to this text object.
