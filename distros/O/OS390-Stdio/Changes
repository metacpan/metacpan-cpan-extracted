Special notes for release 0.008:
--------------------------------
Some XS modifications were done to Stdio.xs so that this extension
should compile under either Perl 5.6.1 (a version where Perl uses stdio) 
or Perl 5.8.0 (Perl defaults to PerlIO) on z/OS.
Very big thanks Brad Van Duser and Nick Ing-Simmons.

Test failure reported under z/OS 1.2 with a dynamic loading Perl 5.8.0
include:

    ok 151
    dynalloc() failed with error code 9700, info code 50 at test.pl line 535.
    not ok 152
    ok 153

    ok 156
    dynfree() failed with error code 438, info code 50 at test.pl line 567.
    not ok 157
    ok 158
    svc99() failed with error code 484, info code 0 at test.pl line 617.
    not ok 159
    ok 160

Special notes for release 0.007:
--------------------------------
Nothing special, just some documentation fixes and a Makefile.PL
fix for compatibility with the MakeMaker that ships with Perl 5.8.0.
Thanks to Vincent Herried and Brad Van Duser.

Special notes for release 0.006:
--------------------------------
The svc99() routine is now functional.
An smf_record() routine is now available yet will be
untested by test.pl owing to SMF deployment differences.  See
the smf_test enclosed program for a way to test smf_record()
before running `make install`.

The stdio_cookbook.pod document has been expanded.

You now have the option of passing data set names (e.g. partial
names) to the get_dcb() and getname() routines in addition to still
being able to pass mvsopen() file handles.

All 161 tests ought to pass for you.

##################################################################

Special notes for release 0.005:
--------------------------------
The dynalloc() routine is now functional.
The dynfree() routine is now functional.

The pds_mem() routine and the internal _pds_mem() function should
now be a bit more efficient than the previous release.  pds_mem()
can now list aliases or aliases and non alias members
depending on the value of an extra optional argument.

* A pds_mem() test has been folded into test.pl, along with a
  dynalloc() and a dynfree() test.  All 76 tests ought to pass for
  you.

##################################################################

Special notes for release 0.004:
--------------------------------
The pds_mem() routine now does a better job of EXTENDing the 
perl XS ST-ack and ought to work with PDS'es that have more than
100 members.  It does not list ALIAS members as was noted
in testing (and documented in Stdio.pm).  A more extensive
test of pds_mem() has yet to be written.  All 70 tests ought to
pass for you though.

##################################################################

Special notes for release 0.003:
--------------------------------
The pds_mem() function is now functional.

##################################################################

Special notes for release 0.002:
--------------------------------
None of the catalog/VTOC dslist functions (vol_ser dsname_level) work.

The pds_mem() function is not yet operational.

resetpos() and forward() have been added along with regression tests.

The bug in get_dcb() has been fixed.

The bug in mvswrite() has been fixed.

None of the vsam routines [locate() update() delrec()] have been tested
at all.

Special notes for release 0.001:
--------------------------------

None of the catalog/VTOC functions (vol_ser dsname_level) work

The pds_mem function is not yet operational.

rewind always seems to return undef.

mvswrite can cause trouble, *I do not recommend using it with
valuable data just yet*.

None of the vsam routines (locate update delrec) have been tested
at all.

the dsname key from the return value of get_dcb is not working.

make test fails these for me:

not ok 19
not ok 36
not ok 39
not ok 40
not ok 45
not ok 53
