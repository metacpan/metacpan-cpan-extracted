NAME

    OPM::Maker - Module/App to build and test OPM packages for Znuny,
    OTOBO, ((OTRS)) Community edition.

VERSION

    version 1.00

DESCRIPTION

    If you do customizing for ticketing systems like Znuny
    <https://znuny.org>, OTOBO <https://otobo.de> or ((OTRS)) Community
    Edition, you need to be able to check your package: Are all files of
    the package included in the file list in the sopm file? Is the sopm
    file valid? And you need to create the OPM file. There is
    otrs.PackageManager.pl included in OTRS installations, but sometimes
    you might not have an OTRS installation on the machine where you want
    to build the package (e.g. when you build the package in a Jenkins
    <http://jenkins-ci.org> job).

    OPM::Maker provides opmbuild that is a small tool for several tasks. At
    the moment it supports:

      * filetest

      Check if all files in the filelist exist on your disk and if all
      files on the disk are listed in the filelist

      * somptest

      Checks if your .sopm file is valid

      * dependencies

      List all CPAN- and ticket system - dependencies of your package

      * build

      Create the OPM file

      * index

      build an index file for an OPM repository.

    Currently under development:

      * dbtest

      Check if the DatabaseInstall and DatabaseUninstall sections in your
      .sopm files are valid. And it checks for SQL keywords.
