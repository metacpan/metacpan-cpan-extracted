NAME

    App::Prun::Scaled - Provides the sprun script as a command line
    interface to Parallel::ForkManager::Scaled.

VERSION

    Version 1.05

SYNOPSYS

        for nr in `seq 1 100`; do echo "echo command #$nr" | sprun
    
        sprun command_file_to_run_in_parallel

DESCRIPTION

    sprun allows you to utilize multiple CPUs for some workloads from the
    shell more easily.

    sprun takes a list of commands (stdin and/or from file(s)) and run the
    commands in parallel.

    sprun is a CLI front end to Paralell::ForkManager::Scaled. It runs
    commands in parallel while trying to keep the CPUs at a specified level
    of activity by constantly adjusting the number of running processes.

      * sprun --help

      * Parallel::ForkManager::Scaled

EXAMPLES

    There are also examples available from the command line --help.

    Run tkprof against all .trc files in the current directory while
    attempting to keep the system 75% idle, don't adjust the number of
    processes unless idle time goes below 74 or above 76, and re-evaluate
    after each process exits (update frequency = 0).

      for F in *.trc; do echo "tkprof $F ${F%trc}txt"; done | sprun -t 75 -T 2 -u 0

    Run all commands in a file (command_file), one line at a time. Manually
    bound the minimum and maximum number of processes to run and start with
    4. Keep the CPU 100% busy (0% idle) and re-evaluate at most every 3
    seconds. Ignore any failed processes, but do report to STDOUT any that
    fail.

      sprun -e -r -m 2 -M 8 -i 4 -u 3 command_file

    Test with the dummy_load script included in the contrib/ directory of
    this distribution:

      for F in `seq 1 100`; do echo "contrib/dummy_load"; done | sprun -v
