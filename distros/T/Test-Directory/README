Test-Directory - Perl extension for maintaining test directories.
===========================

Testing code can involve making sure that files are created and deleted as
expected.  Doing this manually can be error prone, as it's easy to forget a
file, or miss that some unexpected file was added. This module simplifies
maintaining test directories by tracking their status as they are modified
or tested with this API, making it simple to test both individual files, as
well as to verify that there are no missing or unknown files.

The idea is to use this API to create a temporary directory and
populate an initial set of files.  Then, whenever something in the directory
is changes, use the test methods to verify that the change happened as
expected.  At any time, it is simple to verify that the contents of the
directory are exactly as expected.

Test::Directory implements an object-oriented interface for managing test
directories.  It tracks which files it knows about (by creating or testing
them via its API), and can report if any files were missing or unexpectedly
added.

The directory will be automatically cleaned up when the object goes out of
scope.
