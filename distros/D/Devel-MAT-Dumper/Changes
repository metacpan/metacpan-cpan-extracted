0.49    2024-08-29
        [CHANGES]
         * Updates for perl 5.41.3: perl removed `SAVEt_LONG`

0.48    2024-03-07
        [CHANGES]
         * Define PMAT format version 0.6, which adds extra annotations about
           shared HEK pointers to HASH, CODE, GLOB and SCALAR objects.

0.47    2023-03-21
        [CHANGES]
         * Also dump the mortals list to the dumpfile
         * Use mro_get_linear_isa() to perform the package helper walk on
           objects rather than reïmplementing our own bad DFS
         * Delete the now-unused legacy helper API support
           (RT147233, RT147085, RT145110)

0.46    2022-09-12
        [CHANGES]
         * Bugfixes to SYNOPSIS example for latest v0.44 API shape
         * Make sure to run package helpers for superclasses too
         * No longer follow legacy %HELPER_PER_{PACKAGE,MAGIC} hashes; warn
           at dump time if they are nonempty
         * Defined experimental new v0.5 dumpfile version for `feature-class`
           perl branch. This remains experimental while the branch is.

        [BUGFIXES]
         * Fix for module load order problems, by not overwriting entries in
           PL_modglobal if already present

         * Defined a whole new mechanism for dumping information about C-level

           savestack

0.41    2019-08-14 23:25:22
        [CHANGES]
         * Define another thirdparty XS extension for setting dumper helpers
           per blessed package
         * Attach SIGABRT using an unsafe signal handler so it can see the
           inner workings of C or XS code
         * Ignore some unimportant savestack entry types

0.40    2019-02-02 17:14:49

        [BUGFIXES]
         * Perl 5.29.7 removed two UTF-8-related root SVs

           calling dump_optree() on custom ops (related to RT128222)

           modules to provide additional annotations for SV to SV references
         * Define PMAT format 0.4, which adds a table of SV extension sizes

0.37    2018-07-24 17:55:09
        [CHANGES]
         * Define PMAT format 0.3, which represents undef SCALARs more
           efficiently

        [BUGFIXES]
