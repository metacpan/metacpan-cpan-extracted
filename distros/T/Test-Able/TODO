l.  Skip and todo support.

2.  Add option to stop whatever is running and run teardown and shutdown
    methods on first SIGINT.  This would get us a graceful kill.

3.  Ability to run a test suite without hand coding .t files.

4.  Ability to have seperate TAP results for test objects without having
    to manually code .t files.  Requires discovery.

4.1.  Maybe run multiple test objects in the same program as if they were
      seperate programs.  Can probably do this by subclassing TAP::Harness
      and/or TAP::Parser.  But unsure if this could be made to work with
      existing CPAN toolchain.  Also unsure of sidestepping the wisdom of
      using seperate programs.

4.2.  See hmtest at $work for way to find and run all test classes seperately
      (creates .t files in temp dir) and not as one huge run.

5.  Get someone to do Devel::Declare part for method metadata.  rafl?
