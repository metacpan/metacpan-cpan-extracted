NAME
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Upload::SCP - Dist::Zilla release plugin to upload
    via scp

VERSION
    version 0.002

SYNOPSIS
      [Upload::SCP]
      connection = david@example.com
      directory = public_html

DESCRIPTION
    This module uploads a distribution tarball to a remote host via scp on
    release.

    It does not manage passwords. You can put that in your connection string
    if you're nuts, but you really should use an SSH key and "ssh-agent".

ATTRIBUTES
  connection (required)
    An ssh connection string, either "host" or "user@host" or anything else
    Net::OpenSSH supports as a "host" parameter.

  directory (required)
    Remote directory to receive the upload.

  clobber
    Boolean for whether an existing destination path should be clobbered.
    Defaults to false.

  atomic
    Boolean for whether the file should be uploaded with a temporary name
    and then renamed when the upload is complete. Defaults to false.

SEE ALSO
    *   Dist::Zilla::Plugin::UploadToSFTP -- very similar but allows you to
        set passwords via .netrc
