NAME
    Lingua::EN::VarCon - Provides access to the VarCon (Variant Conversion
    Info)

DESCRIPTION
    VarCon is a data set provided as part of the Word List project.

    It contains a number of lists and tables of words that can be used to
    help automatically convert the English language between the differing
    spellings of it's local dialects (American, British, Canadian).

    In an age where Spanish application translations are common, but finding
    a British, Canadian or Australian translation (as used by FAR more
    people than American English) can be almost impossible, and when
    "English" on the internet is increasingly seeming to be "American", it
    is hoped that by providing access to the raw data in a variety of
    different ways (optimised for different application types with different
    load profiles) it will encourage developers to integrate support for
    automated dialect translation into internationalisation toolkits, and
    thus into many applications.

METHODS
    For this initial release, only methods to locate the files are provided.

    Additional access methods will be provided later, or on request.

  abbc_file
    The "abbc_file" method returns the location of the abbc.tab file from
    the VarCon data set.

  also_file
    The "also_file" method returns the location of the variant-also.tab file
    from the VarCon data set.

  infl_file
    The "infl_file" method returns the location of the variant-infl.tab file
    from the VarCon data set.

  wroot_file
    The "infl_file" method returns the location of the variant-wroot.tab
    file from the VarCon data set.

  voc_file
    The "voc_file" method returns the location of the voc.tab file from the
    VarCon data set.

TO DO
    - Split out into smaller language-specific files

    - Access in the form of a memory hash (optimised per language?)

    - Access in the form of a Berkely DB

    - Access in the form of a SQLite database (maybe overkill)
