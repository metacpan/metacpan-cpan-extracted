0.23     2013-11-20 (SHARYANTO)

         [INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES]

         - Now never load/require modules for you, you need to require modules
           yourself.

         - Add option 'import_hook' (import option -hook) to install import
           hook. Otherwise pattern in 'packages' (or 'classes') still will only
           search in existing packages.


0.22     2013-11-20 (SHARYANTO)

         - Bugfix: typo in Log::Any::For::Class which prevented 'use
           Log::Any::For::Class qw(Class1 ...)' to work.


0.21     2013-11-20 (SHARYANTO)

         - No functional changes. Add logging statement and FAQ item.


0.20     2012-12-07 (SHARYANTO)

         [NEW FEATURES]

         - Option 'packages' can now contain regexes. This module will
           automatically add logging if you load modules that match the regexes
           (this is done via an @INC import hook).

         - Add logger options: 'log_sub_args' and 'log_sub_result'.

         [FIXES]

         - Utilize SHARYANTO::Package::Util for more robust package-related
         routines.


0.19     2012-11-29 (SHARYANTO)

         [BUG FIXES]

         - Adjust caller_depth for nested call inside logged package.


0.18     2012-11-29 (SHARYANTO)

         [BUG FIXES]

         - caller_depth adjustment didn't work for Log::Any::For::Class.


0.17     2012-11-29 (SHARYANTO)

         [ENHANCEMENTS]

         - Adjust $Log::Log4perl::caller_depth to correctly show caller location
           (inspired by DBIx::LogAny).

         - Environment variables LOG_PACKAGE_INCLUDE_SUB_RE and
           LOG_PACKAGE_EXCLUDE_SUB_RE are now observed.


0.16     2012-08-16 (SHARYANTO)

         No functional changes. Forgot import in Log/Any/For/Class.pm.


0.15     2012-08-16 (SHARYANTO)

         [ENHANCEMENTS]

         - Allow adding logging to packages during import (e.g. 'use
           Log::Any::For::Package qw(Foo Bar)') for convenience.


0.14     2012-08-16 (SHARYANTO)

         - No functional changes. Fix Log::Any::For::Class's default logger
           which didn't understand 'indent' and 'max_depth' logger args.


0.13     2012-08-16 (SHARYANTO)

         - No functional changes. Fix regression (we do need to copy @_, because
           'args' might need to be changed, e.g. in Log::Any::For::DBI to mask
           passwords).


0.12     2012-08-16 (SHARYANTO)

         [ENHANCEMENTS]

         - Add logger argument: max_depth.


0.11     2012-08-16 (SHARYANTO)

         - No functional changes. Fix indenting.


0.10     2012-08-16 (SHARYANTO)

         [ENHANCEMENTS]

         - Add 'logger_args' argument to allow passing arguments to logger
           routines.

         - Indent log message according to nest level (default indent=1).


0.09     2012-08-16 (SHARYANTO)

         [REMOVED FEATURES]

         - Remove 'filter_args' argument. What I was needed was actually just
           cleaning.

         [ENHANCEMENTS]

         - Use Data::Clean::JSON (and customize it a bit) to clean/filter args
           and result when showing in log.


0.08     2012-08-16 (SHARYANTO)

         - Add 'filter_args' argument. By default, show objects as '(<Classname>
           object)' instead of dumping them.

         - Use Sub::Uplevel so not to mess with caller().


0.07     2012-07-17 (SHARYANTO)

         - Previous release doesn't work. Revert to 0.05.


0.06     2012-07-17 (SHARYANTO)

         - 'filter_subs' cannot be coderef anymore for now.

         - Use Module::Patch 0.07


0.05     2012-07-10 (SHARYANTO)

         [INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES]

         - logger receives hashref arguments instead of hash, so it can modify
           them.

         [ENHANCEMENTS]

         - Handle wantarray undef.


0.04     2012-07-10 (SHARYANTO)

         [ENHANCEMENTS]

         - Add Log::Any::For::Package

         - Add argument: 'filter_subs' ('filter_methods' for
           Log::Any::For::Class).


0.03     2012-07-10 (SHARYANTO)

         [BUG FIXES]

         - Don't try to load module if package already exists.

         - Don't log $self in arguments.


0.02     2012-07-10 (SHARYANTO)

         - No functional changes. Add missing dep to Log::Any.


0.01     2012-07-10 (SHARYANTO)

         - First release.
