    - Don't FAIL due to test count error on systems without lua
    
      The skip count was always off on systems without lua. We said we
      skipped 6 tests, but it was 3 where the URL wasn't =~ /failo/.
    
      It's easier to just skip the entire test suite on those systems, so
      move the prereq for lua before the plan.
    
      Also don't run each of those tests 10 times. There's no need.

    - Use the not-so-well-known dong string delimiting syntax in the
      Perl emitter.

    - Replace horridly complex Lua string escaping with something that
      just uses Lua's multiline string
      syntax. http://www.wellho.net/resources/ex.php4?item=u104/mlx

    - Don't mark any strings coming into the program as UTF-8. Just
      apply binmode() to the filehandles. Garbage in/garbage out.

    - Test UTF-8 output of C programs, and test Lua if we have it

    - FIX UTF-8 output & tests.

    - Add App::QuoteCC::Input::Text for line-delimited text input.

    - Stop using perl5i to avoid perl5i issue #99
      (http://github.com/schwern/perl5i/issues#issue/99)

      Maybe I'll give perl5i another shot once it's more stable. But
      for now I don't feel like chasing its bugs.

    - Cleanup the tempdir() after we're done with it.

    - Be more pedantic about checking for curl/gcc due to cpantesters failures

0.04 2010-05-31 09:32:23

    - Add support for Lua output. The Lua output requires the Lua
      POSIX library.

0.03 2010-05-21 14:27:39

    - Typo: ::Perl not ::C in App::QuoteCC::Output::Perl

    - Hack to make UTF-8 input work. Use Encode to mark strings as
      UTF-8 (why weren't they marked before?!), and use open, not
      File::Slurp to spit out files.

0.02 2010-05-19 13:44:22

    - Lots of changes, more docs, bugfixes, Perl backend and more

0.01 2010-05-17 23:32:52

    - Initial buggy version
