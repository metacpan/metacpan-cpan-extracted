Changelog for VSO

2012-05-07      v0.025
  - DEPRECATED do not use.

2012-02-22      v0.024
  - Changed 'use VSO asa => "Foo::Class"' to 'use VSO extends => "Foo::Class"'
  - Documented the compile-time version of multiple-inheritance also: 'use VSO => [qw( Foo Bar )]'
  - Updated POD to explain just a tiny bit what's going on here.

2012-02-19      v0.023
  - Added special import arg 'use VSO asa => "Foo::Class"' and 'use VSO asa => [qw(Foo::Class Bar::Class)]'
  - Classes that use VSO with the special 'asa' arg will inherit from the classes
    listed at *COMPILE TIME*.
  - 'asa' works the same way as 'extends', but instead of during runtime, it happens
    during compilation.

  - Maybe[Foo] works as expected (now).

2011-12-21      v0.021

  - Updated META.yml

2011-12-09      v0.012
  - Updated the way we deal with subtypes.
  - 'HashRef[Foo]' is translated -> 'HashRef::of::Foo' and isa HashRef,
    same goes for ArrayRef[Foo] -> ArrayRef::of::Foo
  - Basic benchmark shows major speed improvement over v0.011.

2011-12-04      v0.011
  - Almost a total rewrite.
  - Type-checking was overhauled.
  - Major speed degredation.

2011-12-03      v0.010
  - Type-checking is still a work-in-progress.  Another rewrite might just do it.
  - Updated description in POD to not be snarky.

2011-12-02      v0.009
  - Type-checking was re-written.
  - Subtypes are implemented "correctly".
  - The full* Moose type-hierarchy is implemented.
    * excluding RoleName and Maybe[`a]
  - Added test for leaking memory.

2011-11-30      v0.008
  - wantarray is correctly preserved for before/after wrapped subs.

2011-11-30      v0.007
  - Now 'before' and 'after' can be used on subs as well as attributes.

2011-11-29      v0.006
  - Added subtypes.

2011-11-29      v0.005
  - Fixed some minor issues with validating new values for object fields.

2011-11-28      v0.004
  - Updated SYNOPSIS in POD.
  - Added 'where' checking.
  - For 'where', $_ is localized to the yet-to-be-validated value and $_[0] is the
    object to which the attribute (which is validating the value) belongs.
  - Several tweaks here and there.

2011-11-19      v0.003
  - Value type-checking on constructor now works.
  - 'before' and 'after' attribute modifiers now work.
  - Not yet as fast as I want it to be.
  - Type-checking now works for things like:
    isa => 'ArrayRef[My::Thing]'
    - and -
    isa => 'HashRef[My::Thing]'
  - Type-checking slows things down...a lot.

2011-11-17      v0.002
  - Fixed recursive depency issue.

2011-11-17      v0.001
  - Initial release.
