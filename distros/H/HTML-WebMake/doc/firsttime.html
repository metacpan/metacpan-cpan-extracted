                          Chances are, you already have a HTML site you wish to migrate to WebMake.
                          This document introduces WebMake's way of doing things, and how to go
                          about a typical migration.
                          
                        </p>
                        <a name="Place_The_WebMake_File"><h3>Place The WebMake File</h3></a><p>
                          First, pick a top-level directory for the site; that's where you'll place your
                          <strong>.wmk</strong> file. All the generated files should be beneath this directory. In
                          this example I'll call it <strong>index.wmk</strong>.
                          
                        </p>
                        <a name="Make_Templates"><h3>Make Templates</h3></a><p>
                          Next, identify the page templates used in the site. To keep it simple, let's
                          imagine you have only one look and feel on the pages, with the usual stuff in
                          it; high-level HTML document tags, such as &lt;html&gt;, &lt;head&gt;,
                          &lt;title&gt;, &lt;body&gt;, that kind of stuff. There may also be some
                          formatting, such as a &lt;table&gt; with a side column containing links, etc.,
                          or a top-of-page title. All of these are good candidates for moving into a
                          template. I typically call these templates something obvious like
                          <strong>page_template</strong> or <strong>sitename_template</strong>, where <strong>sitename</strong> is the name of
                          the site.
                          
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          For this example, let's imagine you have the HTML high-level tags and a page
                          title as your typical template items.
                          
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          So edit the <strong>index.wmk</strong> file, and add a template content item, by cutting
                          and pasting it from one of your pages. Instead of cutting and pasting the
                          <em>real</em> title, use a metadata reference:
                          <strong>$[this.title]</strong>. Also, replace the text of the page
                          with <strong>${page_text}</strong>; the plan is that, before this content item
                          will be referenced, this content item will have been set to the text you wish
                          to use.
                          
                        </p>
                      </p>
                      <pre>
    &lt;webmake&gt;
    &lt;content name=page_template&gt;
      &lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;$[this.title]&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;body bgcolor=#ffffff&gt;&lt;h1&gt;$[this.title]&lt;/h1&gt;
      &lt;hr&gt;
        ${page_text}
      &lt;hr&gt;
      &lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;
    &lt;/content&gt;
                    </pre>
                    <a name="Grab_The_Pages_Text"><h3>Grab The Pages' Text</h3></a><p>
                      Next, run through the pages you wish to WebMake-ify, and either:
                      
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                      <li>
                        <p>
                          move them into a "raw" subdirectory, from where WebMake can read them
                           with a <a href="contents.html">&lt;contents&gt;</a> tag, or;
                          
                        </p>
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <p>
                          include them into the <strong>index.wmk</strong> file directly.
                          
                        </p>
                      </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                      It's a matter of taste; I initially preferred to do 1, but nowadays 2 seems
                      more convenient for editing, as it provides a very easy way to break up long
                      pages, and it makes search-and-replace easy. Anyway, it's up to you. I'll
                      illustrate using 2 in this example.
                      
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Give each content item a name. I generally use the name of the HTML file, but
                      with a <strong>.txt</strong> extension instead of <strong>.html</strong>. This lets me mentally
                      differentiate the input from the output, but still lets me quickly see the
                      relationship between input file and output file.
                      
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Strip the template elements (head tag, surrounding eye-candy tables, etc.)
                      from each page, leaving just the main text body behind. Keep the titles
                      around for later, though.
                      
                    </p>
                  </p>
                  <pre>
    &lt;content name="document1.txt"&gt;
      ....your html here...
    &lt;/content&gt;
    &lt;content name="document2.txt"&gt;
      ....your html here...
    &lt;/content&gt;
    &lt;content name="document3.txt"&gt;
      ....your html here...
    &lt;/content&gt;
                </pre>
                <a name="Convert_To_EtText_OPTIONAL"><h3>Convert To EtText (OPTIONAL!)</h3></a><p>
                  Now, one of the best bits of WebMake (in my opinion) is <a href="ettext.html">EtText</a>,
                  the built-in simple text markup language; to use this, run the command-line
                  tool <em>ethtml2text</em> on each of your HTML files to convert them
                  to EtText, then include that text, instead of the HTML, as the content items.
                  Don't forget to add <strong>format="text/et"</strong> to the content tag's attributes,
                  though:
                  
                </p>
              </p>
              <pre>
    &lt;content name="document1.txt" format="text/et"&gt;
      ....your ettext here...
    &lt;/content&gt;
    ...
            </pre>
            <p>
              To keep things simple, I'll assume you haven't used EtText in the examples
              from now on.
              
            </p>
            <a name="Add_Titles"><h3>Add Titles</h3></a><p>
              Next, you need to set the titles in the content items, so that they can be
              used in higher-level templates, such as the <strong>page_template</strong> content item we
              defined earlier.
              
            </p>
            <p>
              To really get some power from WebMake, use metadata to do this.
              
            </p>
            <hr />
            <blockquote>
              <p>
                <strong>What is Metadata?</strong>
              </p>
              <p>
                A <em>metadatum</em> is like a normal content item, except it is exposed to other
                pages in the <strong>index.wmk</strong> file. Normally, you cannot reliably read a dynamic
                content item that was set from another page; if one content item sets a
                variable like this:
                
              </p>
            </p>
            <pre>
    &lt;{set foo="Value!"}&gt;
          </pre>
          <p>
            Any content items evaluated after that variable is set can access
            <strong>${foo}</strong>, <em>as long as they occur on the same output page</em>.
            However if they occur on another output page, they may not be able to access
            <strong>${foo}</strong>.
            
          </p>
          <p>
            To get around this, WebMake includes <a href="wmmeta.html">the <strong>&lt;wmmeta&gt;</strong> tag</a>,
            which allows you to attach data to a content item. This data will then be
            accessible, both to other pages in the site (as
            <strong>$[<em>contentname</em>.<em>metaname</em>]</strong>, and to other content
            items within the same page (as <strong>$[this.<em>metaname</em>]</strong>).
            
          </p>
          <p>
            Think of them as like size, modification time, owner etc. on files. A good
            concept is that it's data used to generate catalogs or lists.
            
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <hr />
        <p>
          Anyway, titles of pages are a perfect fit for metadata. So convert your
          page titles into &lt;wmmeta&gt; tags like so:
          
        </p>
      </p>
      <pre>
    &lt;content name="document1.txt"&gt;
      &lt;wmmeta name="title"&gt;Your Title Here&lt;/wmmeta&gt;
      ....your ettext here...
    &lt;/content&gt;
    ...
    </pre>
    <p>
      (BTW it's not required that metadata be stored in the content text; it can
      also be loaded en masse from another location, such as the WebMake file, or
      another file altogether, using the <a href="metatable.html">&lt;metatable&gt;</a>
      directive. Again, it's a matter of taste.)
      
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes, for example if you plan to generate index pages or a sitemap, you
      may wish to add a one-line summary of the content item as a metadatum called
      <strong>abstract</strong>. I'll leave it out of the examples, just to keep them simple.
      
    </p>
    <p>
      Metadata may seem like a lot of bother, but it's a perfect fit when you need to
      generate pages that list links to, or details about, the pages in your site.
      
    </p>
    <p>
      It should always be referred to in <strong>$[square
      brackets]</strong>. I'll explain why later on.
      
    </p>
    <a name="Naming_The_Output_URLs"><h3>Naming The Output URLs</h3></a><p>
      Finally, you've assembled all the content items; now to tell WebMake
      where they should go. This is accomplished using the &lt;out&gt; tag.
      
    </p>
    <p>
      Each output URL, in this example, requires the following content items:
      
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>${page_template}</strong>, which refers to:
          
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>$[this.title]</strong>
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>${page_text}</strong>
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      As you can see, both <strong>this.title</strong> and <strong>page_text</strong> rely on which output URL
      is being written, otherwise you'll wind up with lots of finished pages
      containing the same text. ;)
      
    </p>
    <p>
      There are several ways to deal with this.
      
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          Set a variable in the &lt;out&gt; text, using &lt;{set}&gt;, to the name
           of the content item that should be used for the <strong>page_text</strong>.
          
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Derive the correct value for <strong>page_text</strong> using the name of the
           &lt;out&gt; section itself.
          
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      The simplest way is the latter. WebMake defines a built-in "magic"
      variable, <a href="webmake_vars.html">${WebMake.OutName}</a>, which contains the
      <em>name</em> of the output URL. (Note that output URLs have both a name <em>and</em> a
      filename; you'll see why in the next section.)
      
    </p>
    <p>
      To do this, define another content item:
      
    </p>
  </p>
  <pre>
    &lt;content name=out_helper&gt;
       &lt;{set page_text="${${WebMake.OutName}.txt}" }&gt;
       ${page_template}
    &lt;/content&gt;
</pre>
<a name="What_Does_That_Do"><h3>What Does That Do?</h3></a><p>
  Line 2, in the example above, needs an explanation.
  
</p>
<p>
  This takes the name of the output URL (as discussed above), using a content
  reference: <strong>${WebMake.OutName}</strong>. For example, let's say the
  page was named <strong>pageurl</strong>.
  
</p>
</p>
<pre>
    &lt;{set page_text="${<b>${WebMake.OutName}</b>.txt}" }&gt;
</pre>
<p>
  <b>${WebMake.OutName}</b> expands to <strong>pageurl</strong>:
  
</p>
</p>
<pre>
    &lt;{set page_text="${<b>pageurl</b>.txt}" }&gt;
</pre>
<p>
  It then appends <strong>.txt</strong> to the end:
  
</p>
</p>
<pre>
    &lt;{set page_text="<b>${pageurl.txt}</b>" }&gt;
</pre>
<p>
  and expands that as a <a href="content_refs.html">content reference</a>.
  
</p>
</p>
<pre>
    &lt;{set page_text="<b><i>...entire text of page...</i></b>" }&gt;

  Finally, it stores that in a content item called <strong>page_text</strong>.
  
</p>
<p>
  This looks pretty complicated -- and it is. But the important thing is that,
  as in traditional UNIX style, it's also a very powerful way to do templating
  and variable interpolation; once you get the hang of it, there's plenty more
  stuff it can do. 
  
</p>
<p>
  BTW: you could simply skip defining this "helper" content item altogether,
  and just go to the top of the file and change the template to refer directly
  to <strong>${${WebMake.OutName}.txt}</strong> instead of
  <strong>${page_text}</strong> . That's what I usually do.
  
</p>
<a name="What_s_With_the_Square_Brackets"><h3>What's With the Square Brackets?</h3></a><p>
  But what about the title? Handily, since we defined the titles as metadata,
  and referred to them as <strong>$[this.title]</strong> in <strong>page_template</strong>,
  this is taken care of; once the <strong>${page_text}</strong> reference is
  expanded, <strong>$[this.title]</strong> will be set.
  
</p>
<p>
  Remember I mentioned that metadata should always be referred to in
  <strong>$[square brackets]</strong>? Here's why. Square bracket
  references, or <a href="deferred_content_refs.html"><em>deferred references</em></a>, are
  evaluated only after <a href="content_refs.html">normal, "squiggly bracket" content references</a>.
  
</p>
<p>
  The example page contains the following content references:
  
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>${page_template}</strong>, which refers to:
      
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>$[this.title]</strong>
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>${page_text}</strong>
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Since <strong>${page_text}</strong> is a normal content reference, it will be
  expanded first; and when it's expanded, the &lt;wmmeta&gt; tag setting
  <strong>title</strong> will be encountered. This will cause <strong>this.title</strong> to be set.
  
</p>
<p>
  Once all the normal content references are expanded, WebMake runs through
  the deferred references, causing <strong>$[this.title]</strong> to
  be expanded.
  
</p>
<p>
  If <strong>page_template</strong> had used a normal content reference to refer to
  <strong>${this.title}</strong>, WebMake would have tried to expand it before
  <strong>${page_text}</strong>, since it appeared in the file earlier.
  
</p>
<p>
  Anyway, I digress.
  
</p>
<a name="Writing_The_lt_out_gt_Tags"><h3>Writing The &lt;out&gt; Tags</h3></a><p>
  Each output URL needs an &lt;out&gt; tag, with a <em>name</em> and a <em>file</em>. The
  <em>name</em> provides a symbolic name which one can use to refer to the URL; the
  <em>file</em> names the file that the output should be written to.
  
</p>
<p>
  Typically the name should be similar to the page's main content item's name,
  to keep things simple and allow the shortcut detailed in the previous section
  to work.
  
</p>
<p>
  Also, sites typically use a pretty similar filename to the name, for obvious
  reasons. At least, they do, to start with; further down the line, you may
  need to move one (or more) pages around in the URL or directory hierarchy;
  since you've been referring to them by name, instead of by URL or by filename,
  this means changing only one attribute in the &lt;out&gt; tag, instead of
  trying to do a global search and replace throughout hundreds of HTML files.
  
</p>
<p>
  Anyway, here's a sample &lt;out&gt; tag:
  
</p>
</p>
<pre>
    &lt;out name="document1" file="document1.html"&gt; ${out_helper} &lt;/out&gt;
</pre>
<p>
  But what about multiple outputs? Two choices:
  
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      Simply list all the output HTML files, one after the other.
       Works fine for small sites, and it's simple.
      
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Use a <a href="for.html">&lt;for&gt;</a> tag.
      
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  I don't think you need to see how 1. works, it's pretty obvious.
  Let's see how 2. does it:
  
</p>
</p>
<pre>
    &lt;for name="page" values="document1 document2 document3"&gt;
      &lt;out name="${page}" file="${page}.html"&gt; ${out_helper} &lt;/out&gt;
    &lt;/for&gt;
</pre>
<p>
  The important thing here, is that any references to <strong>${page}</strong> inside
  the <strong>&lt;for&gt;</strong> block, will be replaced with the name of the current item
  in the <strong>values</strong> list.
  
</p>
<a name="Putting_lt_out_gt_Names_To_Work"><h3>Putting &lt;out&gt; Names To Work</h3></a><p>
  So you've named the output URLs. However all your content items contain
  static URLs in the HREFs! Let's fix that.
  
</p>
<p>
  This really is up to you; it's a global search-and-replace. Let's say
  you want to fix all links to "document1.html". Replace this:
  
</p>
</p>
<pre>
    &lt;a href="document1.html"&gt;foo&lt;/a&gt;
</pre>
<p>
  with an <a href="url_refs.html">URL reference</a>, like this:
  
</p>
</p>
<pre>
    &lt;a href="$(document1)"&gt;foo&lt;/a&gt;
</pre>
<p>
  Now, even if "document1.html" is renamed to "blah/whatever/doc1.cgi", you
  won't have to do a search-and-replace again.
