Revision history for Test-Dependencies

0.24    Thu Sep 19, 2019
        * Adjust dependency declaration; CPAN::Meta::Requirements is now
          a separate dist; we are using 'requirements_for_module' which
          was added after our minimum CPAN::Meta requirement.

0.23    Sun Aug 21, 2016
        * load tests don't fail on Test::More 1.30, but do on many versions
          before it; increase minimum requirement (we'll phase out the old
          interface at some point to resolve this issue for good though)

0.22    Sat Aug 20, 2016
        * don't run load tests when Test::More is version 1.1.14; it has a bug
          leading to our tests to fail incorrectly (something about plan
          being output more than once)

0.21    Sun Jul 10, 2016
        * fix test breakage all over the place (thanks @kentfredrick)
        * report the minimum required version in error, instead of the
          installed-and-loaded version

0.20    Wed Jun 29, 2016
        * only test files identified as 'Perl files' by File::Find::Rule::Perl
        * add support for testing runtime, test, devel deps separately
        * add support for cpanfile declared dependencies
        * add support for declaring minimum Perl version (used to test
          the list of core modules)
        * ... and more ...

0.12    Sun Nov 15 01:01:20 CST 2009
        * don't report "perl" being a required dependency when a
          minimum perl version is listed in META.yml

0.11    Thu Dec 27 15:53:30 EST 2007
        * tests no longer run under taint mode so that CPAN testers don't fail tests

0.10    Thu Dec 27 03:28:17 EST 2007
        * let users choose which method of module usage checking to use

0.09    Wed Dec 26 19:51:12 EST 2007
        * work around bug in IPC::Cmd that prevented module from working
        * don't complain if specified dependencies are in core

0.08    Tue Jul 25 22:34:44 EDT 2006
        * now using IPC::Cmd for subprocess communication (to avoid cross-platform issues)

0.07    Thu Jul 20 17:51:08 EDT 2006
        * added empty dummy file because Module::Install does not package empty directories

0.06    Wed Jul 19 16:31:08 EDT 2006
        * better test descriptions when Makefile.PL contains extraneous requires calls
        * no_index'd t-data
        * forgot to bump version number in pod and forgot date in changelog in last revision

0.05    Tue Jul 18 22:55:58 EDT 2006
        * removed references to test_pass (and upped Test::Builder::Tester dep to 0.64)
        * rearranged changelog
        * added tests for empty files and directories

0.04    Sat Jul 15 00:24:01 EDT 2006
        * Properly specify the dependency on Test::Builder::Tester 0.63.
        * handle empty files

0.03    Tue Jul 11 16:17:32 EDT 2006
        Moved to a B::PerlReq backend for determining usage.  We
        also now use the META.yml file to determine what is listed in
        Makefile.PL.  We now differentiate between requires and
        build_requires, and complain if listed requirements are not
        actually used.

0.02    Wed Jun 21 16:34:14 EDT 2006
        Minor POD cleanups

0.01    Wed Jun 21 12:29:39 EDT 2006
        First release, based on Jifty's 00-dependencies.t
