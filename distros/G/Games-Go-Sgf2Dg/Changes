    Change log for Games::Go::Sgf2Dg

    fix coords in MetaPost converter (Dg2Mp)

from 4.246 to 4.249:
    installation:
        move after_build to extra/ dir
        improved TeX installation

from 4.221 to 4.246:
    distribution:
        convert from Subversion to git
        convert to Dist::Zilla
        fix directory structure
    installation:
        improved finding TeX directories and font installation
        added a 'clean' target to tex/Makefile
    code:
        fix some MetaPost bugs noted by Przemek Wesolek
        add initialDiagram option
    documentation:
        fixed a lot of POD errors
        minor updates to the manual

from 4.211 to 4.221:
    fixed t/Dg2Tk.t when X server is not available (for automated testing)
    changed character mappings affected by -texComments to consistently map (or not)
        all the special TeX characters.
    some minor changes to Makefile.PL for auto-testing

from 4.167 to 4.211:
    added -mag N option to set \magnification in Dg2TeX converter
    added \setGoFonts at <size> macro to tex/gooemacs.tex
    updates to manual.tex for all the following changes
    added a section to manual.tex on special gooegb font symbols and
        another section on overlapping fonts
    sgf2dg and Dg2TeX: changed generated TeX quite a bit: normal mode (not
        -simple and not -twoColumn) uses a 'floatLeft' or 'floatRight'
        macro to place the diagram to the left or right of the accompanying
        text.  The float* macros also handle long text, so the
        -longComments option is no longer necessary (it has been removed).
        A 'floatControl' command line option has been added to control
        diagram placement.  The 'float*' macros also manage the diagram
        gap, and the gap in -simple and -twoColumn is now fixed, so the
        -gap command line option has been removed.
    added -placeHandi option to recognize old-style HAndicap property
        by default HAndicap no longer causes the handicap stones to be placed
    added -cs | -coord-style for different coordinate styles
    coordinates are managed centrally by Diagram.pm
    changed magnification default to 1000 so diagrams with coordinates can
        now fit in -twoColumn mode.  Removed restriction preventing using
        twoColum and coords together.
    finishDiagram now takes an text argument which is printed if a diagram is finished
        and verbose mode is on (for an explanation of why new diagrams must be created)
    most verbose messages have been improved
    SZ[x:y] - boards can now be any size (X and Y) - hoshi points are not defined except for some standard sizes
    significant re-structuring of property handling to better handle FF4 SGF files:
        Game properties (players, place, date, etc) are explicitly stored in
            node 0, and are now centrally managed in Diagram.pm for better
            consistency across different converters.
        W/B[tt] still works on 19x19 boards, but other sizes must use W/B[] for a pass
        MN[number] to force move number is supported
        Composed points ([bc:de]) are supported for appropriate properties
    special characters and linebreaks in comments are treated as per the FF4 rules
    All four MArk styles are supported (triangle, circle, square, and X)
    Labeling now works on empty intersections, and for multi-character labels
        some converters are clever enough to switch to a smaller font for labels and
        numbers that are too big (typically between 2 and 3 characters), but only once,
        very big labels will go beyond the boundaries of the intersection
    VW[bc:de] is supported

    Not supported:
       AR[c_pt]      Arrow
       DD[elst]      Dim points: DD[] clears any previous dimming
       LN[c_pt]      Line
       DM[dbl]       Even position
       GB[dbl]       Good for black
       GW[dbl]       Good for white
       HO[dbl]       Hotspot
       UC[dbl]       Unclear
       V[real]       Value (estimated game score)
       BM[dbl]       bad move
       DO            doubtful move
       IT            interesting move
       TE[dbl]       tesuji (good move)
       SL[pt]        Select points (markup unknown)
       AP[stxt:stxt] application name:version
       CA[stxt]      charset
       FF[1-4]       FileFormat
       GM[1-16]      Game
       ST[0-3]       how to show variations (style?)
       FG[pt:stext]] Figure - see spec
       PM[num]       Print mode: 0=>no numbers, 1=>normal 2=>modulo 100 (see spec for details)

    However, sgf2dg stores all properties in the Diagram.pm object for any converter that might like to
        retrieve them

from 4.144 to 4.167:
    don't create manual.dvi until after install is done.
    check and report down-rev PDF::Create (don't use the one on CPAN!).
    some changes in TeX subdir about making manual.dvi.
    improved end-of-diagram handling.
    added Dg2SL converter for Sensei's Library contributed by Marcel Gruenauer.
    added -crop command line option to automatically crop diagrams (shamelessly
        stolen from Marcel's Dg2SL converter).
    significant improvements to the MetaPost (Dg2Mp) converter:
        draw_board can now change with different edge limits.
        hoshi points are drawn based on sgf2dg's concept of hoshis.
        board edges are bold.
        illusory stone is (un)drawn in upper left corner so all diagrams
            line up correctly after stones are placed on the edges.
        black and white stones are now the same size (black stones
            were missing their borders).
        moved game title above first diagram.
