Test-Run

This module is an improved test harness based on Test::Harness, but more
modular, extensible and object-oriented.

There are other modules in the Test::Run namespace that extend it or
provide a front-end to it.

INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

    perl Makefile.PL

    make install
