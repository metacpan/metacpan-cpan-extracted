1.06  Fri Oct  25 2013
    CHANGES:
    - 'delete_job' removes job id record from the queue list.
      This helps to properly diagnose cases when job data was removed by Redis OOM handler
      rather than explicitly deleted by user.
    - Use single hash for storing all job data on Redis server.
    - Removed 'NS_METADATA_SUFFIX' constant.
    FIXES:

    CHANGES:
    - Method 'clear_variability' renamed to 'clear_modified'.
    - Redis server updates only updated data, if you change the metadata,
      not all of the metadata.
    - Change the 'completed' attribute sets 'failed' to 0,
      the change 'failed' sets 'completed' to 0.
      The attributes 'completed' and 'failed' are mutually exclusive.
    - Method 'update_job' accesses the Redis server only if there is some
      data to update.
    FIXES:
    - $@ is localized before we attempt to catch an exception.

1.01  Tue May  28 2013
    CHANGES:
    - Minor changes in documentation.

    FIXES:
    - Checking OS in Makefile.PL

    !!! This is a major upgrade that changes API. It's strongly advised to study
    revised documentation and update your code where necessary !!!

    CHANGES:
    - Needs Redis server version 2.6 or higher as module uses Redis Lua scripting.
    - Improved handling of transactions.
    - Method Redis::JobQueue::Job->job_attributes returns a sorted list.
    - Fields 'result' and 'workload':
      It is possible to use any data structure (SCALAR, HASH, ARRAY, OBJECT).
      It is automatically serialized.
      Allowable size of the data is determined based on the size of the
      serialized string.
    - Added standard job fields:
      Times when job was: 'created', 'started', 'completed', 'updated'
      (user settable),
      Job 'progress' (0...1) and arbitrary status 'message'.
      Appropriate methods added.
    - The job 'updated' field automatically changes with every change to a job.
    - Added a method 'Redis::JobQueue::Job->elapsed'.
    - A set of constants to reflect job status:
      CREATED, WORKING, FAILED, COMPLETED, the user can specify own value
      for status.
      Moved from module Redis::JobQueue to module Redis::JobQueue::Job.
    - Added working with the jobs metadata
      (additional information related to the job):
      It is automatically serialized.
      Methods 'Redis::JobQueue::Job->meta_data',
      'Redis::JobQueue->get_job_meta_fields'.
    - Constant MAX_DATASIZE moved to module Redis::JobQueue.
    - No longer used constants EMAXMEMORYPOLICY, STATUS_DELETED, EXPIRE_DELETED.
    - Added a method 'queue_status' for monitoring the state of the queue.
    - Method 'get_job_status' removed.
      Method 'get_job_data' added instead for receiving data from the standard
      set of fields.
    - Method 'delete_job' removes Redis data structures that are associated
      with the job.
    - Method 'get_jobs' renamed to 'get_job_ids'.
      Jobs can be filtered by queue name or status.
    - Method 'add_job' updates Redis::JobQueue::Job object, if it was passed
      as the first argument.
    - 'encoding => undef' for Redis used, if 'new' invoked without
      the first argument being an object of 'Redis::JobQueue' or 'Redis' class.
    - Exception for not serialized utf8 text fields, when Redis object set
      to 'encoding => undef'.
    - Added test using 'utf8' data (t/01_JobQueue/t_utf8.t).
    - Added new functionality testing.
    - Change to user-friendly constant names.
