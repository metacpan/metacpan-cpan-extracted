	  environment variable.

version 1.01: Wed Sep  2 12:55:19 CEST 2009
	Changes:
	- removed the need for client-side CPAN::Site installation.
	- update 02packages after 1 hour (was 1 day), because CPAN
	  is refreshing more often, lately.

	  a --site option now.
	- CPANSITE_CPAN renamed to CPANSITE_GLOBAL
	- option --stand-alone replaces --cpan ''

	  by Archive::Tar.
	- explain changes in explain_101.txt
	- --cpan option alternative added: -c

version 1.00: Tue Sep  1 10:48:02 CEST 2009
	Large version number jump to indicate structural rewrite
	of internals.  This may trigger someones awareness to be
	more careful in the upgrade.

	Changes:
	- removed mkpackages which was kept for backward compatibility
	- do not extract readme's anymore, probably no-one uses them

	Improvements:
	- use Archive::Tar to unpack archives, to replace the tricky (but
	  fast) scanning of the tar binary.
	- replace use of external 'gzip' binary to IO::Compress
	- use File::Spec in stead of UNIX syntax. The module is probably
	  still not usable on Windows, but coming close.

	- rename t/CPAN-Site-Index.t into t/10index.t
	- improved trace on index

	- 01mailrc and 03modlist are updated from the real CPAN, not
	  just empty.  Motivated by contributions by [Alex Efros]

	  must exist, to protect against errors.
	- Makefile.PL query about role not used [Alex Efros]
	- "Cpansite for the impatient" documentation by [Ales Efros]

	- only take pm's from lib- and top-dir, not f.i. from the
	  test-scripts [Matisse Enzer]

version 0.17: Wed Jan 30 16:44:07 CET 2008

	- 01mailrc is removed when the core cpan is merged in, and
	  created otherwise.

	  [$version,$path] entries
	- only install details file after success
	- command-line option parsing
	- trace to STDOUT, new option verbose
	- CPAN::Site is very useful, and therefore don't call it ALPHA
	- regex to find version now accepts "our"
	- renamed mkpackages to 'cpansite index'
	- cpansite also can start shell and install modules
	- do not ask for URL at installation, because different people
	  may want different local archives: use environment variable
	  CPANSITE.
	- moved Site.pm to lib/CPAN

2006-03-19  Ulrich Pfeifer  <upf@de.uu.net>

	* mkpackages: applied patch from Matisse Enzer so that it uses
	CPAN::Checksums to generate the CHECKSUMS files.  This probably
	renders it useless for ancient per installations.  Even my debian
	Perl 5.8 requires me to fetch these:

	      Compress-Bzip2-2.09
	      Compress-Zlib-1.41
	      Data-Compare-0.13
	      Text-Glob-0.06
	      Number-Compare-0.01
	      File-Find-Rule-0.28
	      Digest-SHA-5.34
	      CPAN-Checksums-1.039
       
	So fall back to the last version if that is too much hassle for
	you.  I may think about a fall back mode if CPAN::Checksums is not
	available.

2005-09-18  Ulrich Pfeifer  <pfeifer@wait.de>

	* Integrated patch from Matisse Enzer to generate .readme files.
	* Switching from MD5 to Digest::MD5
	* Gzip now called with the local file name $_.  $File::Find::name
	should not have worked?

1999-07-26  Ulrich Pfeifer  <upf@de.uu.net>

	* Site.pm: Added CPAN::Config->load call which is required by
	newer CPAN.pm

Wed May  6 13:26:13 1998  Ulrich Pfeifer  <upf@de.uu.net>

	* mkpackages: Rudimentary CHECKSUMS support

Tue May  5 12:40:27 1998  Ulrich Pfeifer  <upf@de.uu.net>

	* mkpackages (wanted): 'package' now found even if in the first
 	line of a file.

Tue Mar  3 12:45:42 1998  Ulrich Pfeifer  <upf@de.uu.net>

	* mkpackages (wanted): $VERSION is found now even if line crosses 
	  block boundary.

Tue Jan 13 11:58:31 1998  Ulrich Pfeifer  <pfeifer@wait.de>

	* mkpackages: Now removes 'id/' from path

Thu Jan  8 12:26:42 1998  Ulrich Pfeifer  <pfeifer@wait.de>

	* Makefile.PL: Ask for default URL

Wed Jan  7 20:15:54 1998  Ulrich Pfeifer  <pfeifer@wait.de>

	* mkpackages (wanted): now parses tar files to extract package
 	names and version
