Log-Any-Adapter-Fille

Adapter Log::Any::Adapter::Fille is intended for logging messages to the
file. Behavior of this adapter resembles simple built-in adapter behavior
Log::Any::Adapter::File, but differs from it in several details:

- Adapter Fille registers logs in advanced format
  <date> <time> <PID> <log_level> <message>

- Adapter Fille correctly processes messages containing wide character

- and other minor differences (see POD)
