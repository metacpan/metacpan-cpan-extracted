Revision history for Perl extension Tao-DBI.

0.012    Tue Jan 6 2016
        - Fix again hash randomization test failures (CPAN RT #109435)

0.011    Tue Jan 5 2016
        - Fix hash randomization test failures (CPAN RT #109435)
        - Add json support to Tao::DBI nested statements

0.01     Sun Jan 3 2016
        - Skip t/006deep.t if YAML is not installed (CPAN RT #109435)

0.0008   Sat Feb 10 2007
        - the default DBI attribute AutoCommit for Tao
          connections is now '0'
        - &dbi_connect was deprecated and replaced by
          the class method Tao::DBI->connect

0.0007   Mon Nov 4 2006
        - this immature code was promoted to a non-development version
        - expression @{%$href}{@idx} used in Tao::DBI::st corrected to
          @{$href}{@idx}
        - I am suspicious some DBD::SQLite versions raised an error
          when preparing statements with invalid SQL, so
          RaiseError => 0 is explicit now in t/007bad.t

0.00_06  Thu Oct 20 2005
        - Tao::DBI::st::initialize() now returns the newly 
          created statement (or not)
        - FIX: prepare() and Tao::DBI::st::new() return undef
          if raw DBI::prepare() returned undef
        - FIX: ':' followed by /[^\w]/ should be literally 
          interpreted, but instead was leaving the SQL with
          translated ? placeholders incomplete
        - the default DBI attribute FetchHashKeyName for Tao
          connections is now 'NAME_lc' - it still misses
          integration with Tao::DBI::st in execute()
        - added new tests "t/007bad.t", "t/008edges.t", "t/009uc_key.t"
