=head1 DESCRIPTION

A class representing a machine image.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

Path to the AMI itself

=item image_state (required)

Current state of the AMI. 
If the operation returns available, the image is successfully registered and available for launching

to be run by the owner of the AMI.

=item product_codes (optional)

An array ref of Net::Amazon::EC2::ProductCode objects (if any) associated with this AMI.

=item architecture (optional)

The AMI architecture (i386 or x86_64).

=item image_type (optional)

The type of AMI this is.  Valid values are:

=over

=item machine

=item kernel

=item ramdisk

=back

=item kernel_id (optional)

The kernel id associated with this AMI (if any). This is only defined for machine type AMIs.

=item ramdisk_id (optional)

The ramdisk id associated with this AMI (if any). This is only defined for machine type AMIs.

=item platform (optional)

The operating system of the instance.

=item state_reason (optional)

A Net::Amazon::EC2::StateReason object representing the stage change.

=item image_owner_alias (optional)

The AWS account alias (e.g., "amazon", "redhat", "self", etc.) or AWS account ID that owns the AMI.

=item name (optional)

The name of the AMI that was provided during image creation.

=item description (optional)
