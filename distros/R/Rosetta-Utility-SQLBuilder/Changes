----------------------------------------------------------------------

    * Rosetta-Utility-SQLBuilder Release 0.22.0 (SVN r1184).

    * This is a retroactive release, made on intended to help ease the
    transition between the first and second major code bases of the Rosetta
    database access framework.  (The first codebase was written mainly
    between 2002-12 and 2005-09, while the second rewritten code base was
    mainly between 2005-10 and later.)  While this release actually takes
    place on January "Friday The Thirteenth" 2006 and is affected by recent
    design decisions, it is for the most part as identical as possible to
    the most recent (2005-09-28) other release of the first code base.
    Think of this retroactive release as having been made on 2005-09-29, in
    regards to its dependency versions, design decisions, documentation for
    SVN repository location, TODO, etc.  Some of the details being
    published now, like the SVN location, is already false (its actually at
    http://svn.utsl.gen.nz/trunk/Rosetta-old/), but they are maintained as
    they were for historical posterity.

    * The changes with this release are all summed up by that there is no
    longer a distinct "SQL::Routine" name space, and all packages that were
    in that name space are now in the "Rosetta" name space.  There are no
    actual functionality changes, just a shifting around of components;
    your existing code that used the old packages will remain compatible
    with just some renaming of your package references.

    * As of this release, the distribution has been renamed from
    SQL-Routine-SQLBuilder to Rosetta-Utility-SQLBuilder;
    "Rosetta-Utility-SQLBuilder-0.22.0" is the next version after
    "SQL-Routine-SQLBuilder-0.21.2".

    * All of the packages have been renamed as follows:
    SQL::Routine::SQLBuilder -> Rosetta::Utility::SQLBuilder,
    SQL::Routine::SQLBuilder::L::en -> Rosetta::Utility::SQLBuilder::L::en.

    * All t/* files have been renamed: t/SRT_SB_*.t -> t/ROS_U_SB_*.t,
    t/lib/t_SRT_SB_*.t -> t/lib/t_ROS_U_SB_*.t.

    * New code file versions are: SQLBuilder.pm 0.22.0 and en.pm 0.3.0.

    * Updated external dependency on Rosetta::Model (was SQL::Routine) to
    0.71.0.

    * Renamed all Locale::KeyedText Message and Template keys from
    "SRT_[|SB_]*" to "ROS_[M_|U_SB_]*".  Er, you may have to update your
    code to account for this also, to avoid breakage.

    * In SQLBuilder.pm, replaced 29 "', '" each with "q{, }".

2005-09-28   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * SQL-Routine-SQLBuilder Release 0.21.2 (SVN r878).

    * New code file versions are: SQLBuilder.pm 0.21.2 and en.pm 0.2.2.

    * From now on, any ordinary 'use [|only ]Foo' statements that appear
    within *.pm files will be located in different places than before; the
    'use' statements for modules that do not export anything, particularly
    object oriented modules, will appear near the top of the file, above
    all package declarations, but just below the use-pragma statements; the
    'use' statements for modules whose exported functions we are using will
    be placed just below the declarations of each package in which the
    relevant exported functions are used.

    * Removed any line-trailing whitespace from all distribution files; the
    one exception was those inside the SRT_SB_10_Generic.t here-docs.

    * Reformatted all code by swapping various string quoting delimiters.

    * Reformatted SQLBuilder.pm to un-cuddle all 'else' and 'elsif' blocks.

    * Updated SQLBuilder.pm and t_SRT_SB_Util.pm to replace all of their
    'unless' conditionals with equivalent 'if' conditionals.

    * Updated SQLBuilder.pm to rename all of its 'foreach' loops to 'for'.

    * Updated SQLBuilder.pm to reformat the 5 '|' delimited regular
    expressions as '/' delimited ones.

    * Updated SQLBuilder.pm to reformat all 5 regular expressions so that
    they use the /x flag.

    * Reformatted all code to change any "if( ... ) {" to "if (...) {".

    * Updated SQLBuilder.pm to reformat all 4 'while' like the 'if' were.

    * Added named constant $EMPTY_STR to SQLBuilder.pm.

    * Updated SQLBuilder.pm to add labels to the 1 un-labeled
    [next|last|redo] statement, and its innermost bounding loop control.

    * Reformatted all code so that any uses of the named unary operators
    [defined|ref] no longer have parenthesis around their argument.

    * Updated SQLBuilder.pm to reformat 1 use of 'exists', 2 uses of 'uc',
    and 1 use of 'lc' like with 'ref'.

    * Removed 1 superfluous use of 'scalar' in SQLBuilder.pm.

    * Updated SQLBuilder.pm to replace 2 "<condition> and return ...;" each
    with "return ... if <condition>;".

    * Updated SQLBuilder.pm to replace 2 "<condition> or $self->_throw ..."
    each with "$self->_throw ... if <reverse-condition>".

    * Updated t_SRT_SB_Util.pm to replace 1 "if ... return ..." with its
    postfix-if equivalent.

    * Updated SQLBuilder.pm to rearrange 4 conditional '_throw...' statements
    so they have postfix-if conditionals.

    * Reformatted all code, in SQLBuilder.pm, so that any uses of the
    built-in operators or functions named [bless|join|push|split|unpack] no
    longer have parenthesis around their argument lists; either the parens
    were just removed, or they were moved to surround both the
    operator/function name and its arguments.

    * Added new external dependency on the honorary built-in function
    List::MoreUtils::all() to SQLBuilder.pm.  Then updated the
    build_schema_or_app_table_create() method to use this function rather
    than a last-terminated for-loop when determining whether all columns in
    an index are mandatory.  Specifically, List::MoreUtils versions 0.12
    and up are required, since versions 0.11 and below didn't export some
    functions.

    * Split up some long lines in en.pm.

    * Updated any DEPENDENCIES documentation to reformat any indented
    sections as paragraphs, and show version ranges like 'only' takes them.

    * Reformatted all code so that every occurance of the string
    concatenation operator (.) has a space between the operator and each of
    its 2 arguments, rather than their all being in contact.  Also
    reformatted any lines that are split on this operator so the operator
    appears at the start of the second line, rather than the end of the
    first line.

    * Reformatted a few multi-line statements so that any [=|and|or] that
    are split on appear at the start of a line rather than the end of one.

    * Reformatted all of the code comments at the top of SQLBuilder.pm,
    where its object property names, and constant values, are declared,
    so that all comment lines don't exceed the 75 character line length.

    * In SQLBuilder.pm, reformatted 18 cascading ternary statements into
    aligned columns.

    * Other miscellaneous code line alignments and splitting.

2005-09-12   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * SQL-Routine-SQLBuilder Release 0.21.1 (SVN r808).

    * New code file versions are: SQLBuilder.pm 0.21.1 and en.pm 0.2.1.

    * Updated all POD-containing files to re-wrap any non-indented POD
    paragraphs to a 75 character width, which is 5 less than the 80
    character width they were wrapped to before.  This change should make
    it easier to copy and paste a diff or patch of this documentation into
    an email message, where it is quoted at least once, without any line
    wrapping occurring.  Likewise, these standard documentation files were
    re-wrapped to 75 characters: ReadMe, INSTALL, LGPL|GPL, Changes, TODO.

    * Revised this Changes file to replace all detail entries for releases
    0.18 thru 0.21.0 with a significant release list for the same period;
    also added references to when all 'Rosetta developer release' (#s 1-3)
    were.

    and not just design documentation.

2004-03-25   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Rosetta Release 0.29 was released on CPAN.  This is the last release
    of any distribution for which all of the existing work that became the
    SQL-Routine-SQLBuilder distribution was purely in the form of design
    documentation, without executable code of any kind.

2004-03-21   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Rosetta Release 0.27 was released on CPAN.  This is the first release

    it; it was renamed from Rosetta::Engine::Common::SQLBuilder.

2004-03-08   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Rosetta Release 0.26 was released on CPAN.  This is the last release
    of any distribution for which the documented name of the proposed

2004-02-12   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Rosetta Release 0.23 was released on CPAN.  This is the last release
    of any distribution for which the documented name of the proposed
    module that became SQL::Routine::SQLBuilder was given the name
    Rosetta::Driver::Common::SQLBuilder.

2003-04-15   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Rosetta Release 0.07 was released on CPAN.  This is the first release
    of any distribution to have proposal documentation that splits out SQL
    generation code into its own module, whereas prior to this the
    documentation included SQL generation as one of several functions
    performed by several distinct modules.  The proposed name for this
    module is Rosetta::Driver::Common::SQLBuilder.

2003-01-27   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Rosetta Release 0.02 was released on CPAN; this is the first release
    of the Rosetta distribution.  Early versions of the design
    documentation that became the SQL-Routine-SQLBuilder distribution were
    included.

    * DBIx-Portable Release 0.01 was released on CPAN; this is the only
    release of the DBIx-Portable distribution.  This is the first release
    of any distribution to contain design documentation that became the
    SQL-Routine-SQLBuilder distribution.

2002-11-12   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Began development on the modules which became the
    SQL-Routine-SQLBuilder distribution as their own entity that is
    separate from my application, for open-source distribution on CPAN.
    The modules were to comprise an RDBMS-generic DB framework for any
    application to use.

    * Modules based on a template created by h2xs 1.18.

2002-07-28

    * Posted the first significant update to the second prototype, which
    added an index or cache for data that was expensive to calculate for
    each page request, and involved rewriting about a fourth of the perl
    code.

2002-06-07

    * Posted to my website the second public prototype demo of the new
    self-proprietary database driven application, whose database schema,
    user interface, feature set, and Perl application code was almost
    completely rewritten. The new version explicitly had separate modules
    for database communication and the web interface logic, with
    MySQL-specific code and database generic or data dictionary code in
    separate files, and separate files for parts of the web interface.  The
    program used the same generic CPAN modules as in the first prototype,
    DBI/MySQL and CGI::Portable.

    * This is when I started writing self-contained code components that
    were explicitly designed to enable external code that used them to work
    seamlessly on multiple database products, and hence 2002 is the start
    of my declared copyright date range for SQL::Routine::SQLBuilder.

2001-11-24

    * Posted the last update to the first prototype.

2001-07-12

    * Posted to my website the first public prototype demo of a new
    self-proprietary database driven application, which is like a cross
    between a multimedia metadata catalogue and a repository for historical
    or genealogical data.  This application contained the first prototypes
    of code that ended up in these modules.  All of this application's
    code, for database communication and web interface logic, was situated
    in a single module, with the rest of the program being more generic
    CPAN modules like DBI (and DBD for MySQL) and CGI::Portable.

2000-05-17

    * Requested MySQL database privileges on my web host so I have
    something to start developing, testing and deploying database driven
    applications on.
