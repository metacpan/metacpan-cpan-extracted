Version 1.0 -> 1.1
  * Removed Makefile from the MANIFEST per Graham Barr <gbarr@ti.com>
  * Replaced test.pl with Graham Barr's <gbarr@ti.com> contributed script.
  * Fixed an "Use of uninitialized value" warning on $UserScrewUp

Version 1.1 -> 1.11 (released 12/14/1998)
  * Bugfix in num2usdollars to fix a condition where "ONE DOLLARS" was
    returned instead of "ONE DOLLAR"
  * Added &num2word_short_ordinal().  This addition was the suggestion of
    Kim Ryan <kimaryan@ozemail.com.au>.

Version 1.11 -> 1.12 (released 01/19/2000)
  * Bugfix in num2word_ordinal() which caused the function to return
    cardinal words for values 0 through 20.  Thanks to Benjamin Franz
    <snowhare@nihongo.org> for finding this bug and sending a patch.

Version 1.12 -> 1.13 (released 10/05/2009)
  * NOTE: There are no functional changes in this release.
  * Changed the license to the OSI certified Artistic License.
  * Updated my email address (all listed were out of date).
  * Fixed verbage/verbiage misspellings in comments and variable names.
  * Updated POD regarding "short scales" vs. "long scales" -- the
    American thousands system versus the British millions system --
    and changed the reference URL to a working one at Wikipedia.
  * Refactored some code to improve the code style and readability, and
    to address some criticisms presented by Earle Martin.
  * Refactored test.pl a bit and added two additional test cases.

Version 1.13 -> 1.14 (released 10/02/2011)
  * Applied a small bug fix and documentation patch from Mr. Neil Bowers.
  * Added Lingua::EN::Nums2Words::set_case() and added lowecase tests.

Version 1.14 -> 1.15 (released 07/28/2016)
  * Fixed num2word_short_ordinal() bug reported by Paul Hackett
    - https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=116552

Version 1.14 -> 1.15 (released 07/29/2016)
  * No functional changes. Incremented the version number due to a
    CPAN packaging mistake that I make in version 1.15 combined
    with CPAN not allowing authors to overwrite previous versions.
