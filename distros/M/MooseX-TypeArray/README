NAME
    MooseX::TypeArray - Create composite types where all subtypes must be
    satisfied

VERSION
    version 0.1.0

SYNOPSIS
      {
        package #
          Foo;
        use Moose::Util::TypeConstraint;
        use MooseX::TypeArray;
        subtype 'Natural',
          as 'Int',
          where { $_ > 0 };
          message { "This number ($_) is not bigger then 0" };

        subtype 'BiggerThanTen',
          as 'Int',
          where { $_ > 10 },
          message { "This number ($_) is not bigger than ten!" };


        typearray NaturalAndBiggerThanTen => [ 'Natural', 'BiggerThanTen' ];

        # or this , which is the same thing.

        typearray NaturalAndBiggerThanTen => {
          combining => [qw( Natural BiggerThanTen )],
        };


        ...

        has field => (
          isa => 'NaturalAndBiggerThanTen',
          ...
        );

        ...
      }
      use Try::Tiny;
      use Data::Dumper qw( Dumper );

      try {
        Foo->new( field => 0 );
      } catch {
        print Dumper( $_ );
        #
        # bless({  errors => {
        #   Natural => "This number (0) is not bigger then 0",
        #   BiggerThanTen => "This number (0) is not bigger than ten!"
        # }}, 'MooseX::TypeArray::Error' );
        #
        print $_;

        # Validation failed for TypeArray NaturalAndBiggerThanTen with value "0" :
        #   1. Validation failed for Natural:
        #       This number (0) is not bigger than 0
        #   2. Validation failed for BiggerThanTen:
        #       This number (0) is not bigger than ten!
        #
      }

DESCRIPTION
    This type constraint is much like the "Union" type constraint, except
    the union type constraint validates when any of its members are valid.
    This type constraint requires ALL of its members to be valid.

    This type constraint also returns an Object with a breakdown of the
    composite failed constraints on error, which you should be able to use
    if you work with this type constraint directly.

    Alas, Moose itself currently doesn't support propagation of objects as
    validation methods, so you will only get the stringified version of this
    object until that is solved.

    Alternatively, you can use MooseX::Attribute::ValidateWithException
    until Moose natively supports exceptions.

FUNCTIONS
  typearray
    This function has 2 forms, anonymous and named.

  typearray $NAME, \@CONSTRAINTS
      typearray 'foo', [ 'SubTypeA', 'SubTypeB' ];
      # the same as
      typearray { name => 'foo', combining =>  [ 'SubTypeA', 'SubTypeB' ] };

  typearray $NAME, \@CONSTRAINTS, \%CONFIG
      typearray 'foo', [ 'SubTypeA', 'SubTypeB' ], { blah => "blah" };
      # the same as
      typearray { name => 'foo', combining =>  [ 'SubTypeA', 'SubTypeB' ], blah => "blah" };

  typearray $NAME, \%CONFIG
      typearray 'foo', { blah => "blah" };
      # the same as
      typearray { name => 'foo', blah => "blah" };

  typearray \@CONSTRAINTS
      typearray [ 'SubTypeA', 'SubTypeB' ];
      # the same as
      typearray { combining =>  [ 'SubTypeA', 'SubTypeB' ]  };

  typearray \@CONSTRAINTS, \%CONFIG
      typearray [ 'SubTypeA', 'SubTypeB' ], { blah => "blah};
      # the same as
      typearray { combining =>  [ 'SubTypeA', 'SubTypeB' ] , blah => "blah" };

  typearray \%CONFIG
      typearray {
        name      =>  $name   # the name of the type ( ie: 'MyType' or 'NaturalBigInt' )
        combining => $arrayref # the subtypes which must be satisfied for this constraint
      };
