0.1     Wed, 04 Jun 2008 16:27:50 UTC

0.12    Fri, 04 Jul 2008 22:58:23 UTC
	Added support for extensions - Net::OpenMicroBlogging in particular

0.13    Thu, 13 Nov 2008 22:45:46 UTC
	Added support for Consumer Request (token-less / two-legged) message type

0.14    Sat, 13 Dec 2008 17:29:36 UTC
	Add POD for consumer requests

0.15    Fri, 05 Jun 2009 00:48:07 UTC
	Added Twitter demo consumer
	Warn if message parameter is already UTF-8 that it will be double-encoded; see I18N section of Net::OAuth manpage
	Better handling of missing 'realm' parameter in Authorization header methods
	Better handling of request_url parameter; see REQUEST_URL PARAMETER section of Net::OAuth manpage
	Fixed http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=44699 - encode spaces to %20 rather than + in $message->to_url()

0.16   Mon, 15 Jun 2009 18:36:17 UTC
  Added support for OAuth 1.0A - see POD section 'OAUTH 1.0A' for details - Net::OAuth still defaults to 1.0 for now

0.17   Thu, 25 Jun 2009 16:59:50 UTC
  Fixed https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=47293 - Message->from_hash was validating using the incorrect class, causing a 'Parameter X not valid for a message of type Y' message on V1.0a messages.  Thanks Jeff Dairiki!

0.18   Thu, 25 Jun 2009 17:18:04 UTC
  Fixed accidental (though probably harmless) regression in 0.17

0.19   Fri, 26 Jun 2009 17:30:06 UTC
  Fixed https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=47369 - Don't automatically set oauth_version parameter when message is created via from_hash (or from_url, from_post_body, etc).  Thanks COSIMO!

0.20   Fri, 13 Nov 2009 18:56:55 UTC
  Fixed http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=48867 - error in synopsis - thanks Adam Taylor!
  Removed UTF8 double-encoding warning.  Now Net::OAuth::Message::encode() uses Encode::is_utf8() to determine if the input is already UTF-8 encoded.  If so, it runs decode_utf8() on it before sending it to uri_escape_utf8().  Thanks Hector Garcia Alvarez!
  Potentially fixed an issue found by Marc Mims, where HMAC_SHA1 was failing to load, breaking some CPAN tests.  Build.PL now explicitly requires Digest::SHA1 and Encode.  Hopefully that fixes it.

0.21   Wed, 10 Mar 2010 22:20:49 UTC
  Added xAuth support with xAuthAccessTokenRequest (thanks Masayoshi Sekimura and Simon Wistow)
  Added performance patch to decrease stat() system calls when requiring modules (thanks Brad Whitaker)

0.22   Thu, 11 Mar 2010 00:21:26 UTC
  Renamed xAuthAccessTokenRequest to XauthAccessTokenRequest for CamelCaseConsistency
  Added a couple tests for XauthAccessTokenRequest
    
0.23   Thu, 18 Mar 2010 17:23:36 UTC
  Removed UNIVERSAL::require dependency
  Net::OAuth->request constructor now dies if module fails to load (thanks Mike Schleif)
  Fixed https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=55635 Incorrect dependencies (thanks Jens Rehsack)
  Replaced die() with croak()
  
0.24   Sun, 21 Mar 2010 03:39:40 UTC
  Fix test breakage in 0.23

0.25   Sun, 21 Mar 2010 03:50:40 UTC
  Gah, $VERSION lameness

0.26   Wed, 16 Jun 2010 19:59:04 UTC
  Message::encode no longer tries fix potential 'double-encoding' (in any case it appeared to be doing it wrong).  Now it just complains if you try to pass in undecoded strings. (thanks Daisuke Maki and KATOU Akira)
  
0.27   Wed, 16 Jun 2010 20:39:59 UTC
    Added class for Yahoo! access token refresh request (thanks Marc Mims)

0.28   Fri, 06 Jan 2012 05:51:04 UTC
    Added HMAC-SHA256 support
