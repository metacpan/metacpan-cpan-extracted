Net/FTP/Recursive
==================

This module augments the list of Net::FTP methods with several
methods that automatically descend directory structures for you.
The methods are:

     rget - Retrieve an entire directory tree.
     rput - Send an entire directory tree.
     rdir - Receive an entire directory tree listing.
     rls  - Receive an entire directory tree listing, filenames
            only.
     rdelete - Remove an entire directory tree.

There are several sample scripts that illustrate some of the
possible usages of these methods.  Please see the "samples"
directory in this distribution or check the documentation that
comes with the module.
