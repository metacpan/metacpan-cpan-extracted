DESCRIPTION
       Most XML tools aim to parse some simple XML and to produce
       some formatted output. XML::Filter::Digest aims to do the
       opposite.

       Many formats can now be parsed by a SAX Driver. XPath
       offers a smart way to write queries to XML.
       XML::Filter::Digest is a PerlSAX Filter to query XML and
       to provide a simpler digest as a result.

       XML::Filter::Digest uses its own script language that can
       be parsed by XML::Script::Digest to formulate these digest
       queries.

       In fact, a digest script is well-formed XML.

       The following script defines that the result XML should
       have a root element called extract, containing several
       elements called section starting from the 4th HTML header.
       Those section elements contain id, title and intro
       elements, which in turn contain the XPath string-value of
       their nodes as character data.

           <digest name="extract">
           <collect
               name="section"
               node="//html//h2[position()&gt;3]"
               >
               <collect
                   name="id"
                   node="child::a/attribute::name"
               />
               <collect
                   name="title"
                   node="."
               />
               <collect
                   name="intro"
                   node="following-sibling::p[position()=1]"
               />
           </collect>
           </digest>

       The digest script parser silently ignores anything other
       than digest elements and collect elements. The digest
       element needs a name attribute defining the name of the
       root element, while the collect element needs an
       additional node attribute defining XPath queries for
       nested elements.

       Only a single digest element should exist within a script
       document, but there is no need that the digest script be
       the root element of the document. Nested within the digest
       element should be collect elements. They may contain
       several other collect elements recursivly.

       METHODS

       The XML::Filter::Digest object may act as a Filter to
       receive SAX events, or directly as a Driver if you provide
       a Source option to the parse method. The filter is
       reusable, if you arrange that the chain of Handlers is
       also reusable to handle multiple documents in batches. The
       filter requires a Handler and a Script option before the
       start_document method is called.

       The XML::Script::Digest object may act as a Handler to
       receive SAX events, or directly if you provide a Source
       option to the parse method. The script object is reusable
       and a single script object can be used for several filter
       objects.

       new Creates a new XML::Driver::HTML object. Default
           options for parsing, described below, are passed as
           key-value pairs or as a single hash.  Options may be
           changed directly in the object.

       parse
           Parses a document by embedding XML::Parser::PerlSAX.
           This allows you to use XML::Filter::Digest directly as
           a Driver and simplifies generating a ready-to-use
           XML::Script::Object.

           Options, described below, are passed as key-value
           pairs or as a single hash.  Options passed to parse()
           override the default options in the object for the
           duration of the parse.

       start_document
           Notifies the object about the start of a new document.
           The object will do its cleanup if it's reused.

       end_document
           Notifies the object about the end of the document.
           Return value of XML::Script::Digest is $self, to be
           used as the return value of the parse method.

           XML::Filter::Digest will walk through the script
           object to generate a stream of SAX events for its
           Handler. Return value of XML::Filter::Digest is the
           return value of the end_document method of the Handler
           object.

       OPTIONS


       Script
           XML::Script::Digest objects can be used for several
           XML::Filter::Digest objects.

       Handler
           Default SAX Handler to receive events from
           XML::Filter::Digest objects.

       Source
           XML::Filter::Digest and XML::Script can be used on raw
           XML directly, by calling the parse() method. To do
           this, the Source option is required for embedding the
           PerlSAX parser.

           The `Source' hash may contain the following
           parameters:

           ByteStream
               The raw byte stream (file handle) containing the
               document.

           String
               A string containing the document.

           SystemId
               The system identifier (URI) of the document.

           Encoding
               A string describing the character encoding.

           If more than one of `ByteStream', `String', or
           `SystemId' are present, preference is given first to
           `ByteStream', then `String', then `SystemId'.

NOTES
       The XML::Filter::Digest is not a streaming filter, but a
       buffering filter, as any processing is done by the
       end_document method. This could cause the Perl interpreter
       to run out of memory on large XML files. Ideally, define a
       ulimit, to prevent the system going offline for several
       minutes, till it detects that there is really no memory to
       seize somewhere in the network. Adding network swapspace
       ad infinitum only make things worse, so I have the
       following line in my .bashrc. Other operating systems
       offer similar constraints.

           ulimit -v 98304 -d 98304 -m 98304

       This line is ok on a single user machine with 32M ram and
       128MB swap. I can raise this value, if I know that I wanna
       walk the dog.

BUGS
       not yet implemented:

           reuse of XML::Filter::Digest objects.

       XML::XPath::Builder bug:

           XML::Filter::Digest 0.06 has been tested with XML::XPath
           version 1.10. Prior versions of XML::XPath::Builder wont work.
