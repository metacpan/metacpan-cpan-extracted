NAME
    Net::Minecraft::Login - Basic implementation of the Minecraft Login
    Protocol.

VERSION
    version 0.002000

DESCRIPTION
    This is a basic implementation of the Minecraft Login protocol as
    described at <http://wiki.vg/Session#Login>

      use Net::Minecraft::Login;

      my $ua = Net::Minecraft::Login->new();

      my $result = $ua->login(
        user => 'Bob',
        password => 'secret',
      );
      if( not $result->is_success ){
        die $result;
      }
      say "Login for user " . $result->user . " succeeded";

    Note, it presently does no explicit session stuff, only performs the
    basic HTTP Request and returns the response as an object.

CONSTRUCTOR ARGUMENTS
    This section describes arguments that may be optionally passed to
    "->new()", but as of the time of this writing, none are explicitly
    required, and are offered only to give leverage to strange use cases (
    and tests )

      my $instance = Net::Minecraft::Login->new(
        user_agent   => ... ,
        http_headers => { ... },
        http_engine  => HTTP::Tiny->new(),
        login_server => 'https://somewhere.else.org/'
        version      => 14, # IN THE FUTURE!
      );

    Additional Constructor arguments can also be found in
    "Net::Minecraft::Role::HTTP"

  "login_server"
    HTTP Address to authenticate with.

      type  : String
      default : https://login.minecraft.net/

  "version"
    "Client" version.

      type  : String
      default : 13

    This field indicates the version of the "Launcher". Minecraft may at
    some future time produce an updated launcher, and indicate that this
    specified version is out of date.

    Mojang Minecraft Launchers will be required to download a newer version,
    and users of "Net::Minecraft::Login" will either

    a) Be required to update to a newer "Net::Minecraft::Login" that
    supports the newer version and changes that implies
    b) Assuming no "Login Protocol" Changes, only have to specify "version
    =>" either to the constructor, or as an argument to "login"

METHODS
  "login"
      signature: { user => String , password => String, version? => String }
      return   : Any( Net::Minecraft::LoginResult , Net::Minecraft::LoginFailure )

      my $result = $nmcl->login(
        user   => 'notch',
        password => 'jellybean',
      );

      if( not $result->is_success ){
        say "$result";
      } else {
        say "Logged in!";
      }

    See "::LoginFailure" and "::LoginResult"
