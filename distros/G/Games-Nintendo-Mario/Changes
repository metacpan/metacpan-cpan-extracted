Revision history for Games-Nintendo-Mario

          [IMPORTANT]
        - This may be the last update to Games-Nintendo-Mario!  Although I
          receive dozens of support requests or letters of appreciation each
          day about this code, I receive very few patches, including those to
          bring the library up to date with modern Mario standards such as
          NSMB2 or NSMBU, let alone NSLU.  Although I am happy to continue
          supporting this library's dedicated userbase, I cannot do so without
          hardware for comparison testing.  Donations of a Wii U or 3DS console
          would certainly lead to new versions, and hopefully to the
          long-awaited Games::Nintendo::Metroid.
