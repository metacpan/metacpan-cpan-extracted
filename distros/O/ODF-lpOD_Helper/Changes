6.000 - A major overhaul with incompatible API changes.

        "Character mode" is now the default and the old ':chars' import tag
        is deprectated.  Now you only need to 
          use ODF::lpOD; 
          use ODF::lpOD_Helper;
        A new import tag ':bytes' preserves the old ODF::lpOD
        behavior where method args and results must be encoded binary.

        Introduced methods Hget_text, Hoffset_into_vtext, Hinsert_element, 
        Hsplit_element_at, Hdescendants, Hnext_elt, Hnormalize

        A new concept is a "prune condition" when searching or collecting 
        virtual text, to treat specified tags as opaque (i.e. their children 
        are not visited).  This can be used to skip over nested paragraphs 
        such as may exist inside Frames or Tables.

        Results from multi-segment substitutions are now comprehensively
        "normalized", eliminating consecutive or zero-length text:s segments
        and ensuring that consecutive spaces are not stored in #PCDATA nodes.

        New style spans are "hoisted" to the top level in a paragraph
        to avoid creating nested spans (existing spans are cloned and
        partitioned if necessary around hoisted new spans).
        NOTE: Please let me know if you *do* want nested spans -- it should
        be easy to make hoisting an option. 

3.000 - Hsearch reworked with API change; many bug fixes; test improvements

2.000 - First public release to CPAN

1.xxx - internal use only beginning ca. 2012.  Moved from RCS.
