For an updated list of bugs, see

  https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Dist/Display.html?Name=bignum

The following list is not up to date:

Known bugs:

* print 2 + 4.5,"\n";			# produces "6.5" but should be actually 65/10

* perl -Mbignum=t -le 'print 2.0'
 Loading Math::BigInt::Trace
 MBI import Math::BigInt::Trace :constant upgrade Math::BigFloat::Trace lib Calc
 Loading Math::BigFloat::Trace
 MBF import Math::BigFloat::Trace :constant downgrade Math::BigInt::Trace
 MBI new '2' => '2' (Math::BigInt::Trace)
 MBF new '2.0' => '2' (Math::BigInt::Trace)
 2

The order of MBI and MBF is reversed, since the output is done *after* the new,
but the new of MBF downgrades internally to MBI. No solution yet.

Please send me test-reports, your experiences with this and your ideas - I love
to hear about my work!
