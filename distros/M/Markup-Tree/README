NAME
    Markup::Tree - Unified way to easily access XML or HTML markup locally
    or remotly.

SYNOPSIS
            use Markup::Tree;

            my @preserve = qw(pre style script code);

            my $tree = Markup::Tree->new ( markup => 'html', no_squash_whitespace => \@preserve,
                                            no_indent => \@preserve );

            $tree->parse_file('http://lackluster.tzo.com:1024');

            $tree->save_as('ltzo.com.xml', 'xml');

            # or

            my $tree = Markup::Tree->new ( markup => 'xml', no_squash_whitespace => \@preserve,
                                            no_indent => \@preserve );

            $tree->parse_file('http://lackluster.tzo.com:1024/index.php.xml');

            $tree->foreach_node(\&start, \&end);

DESCRIPTION
    I wanted a module to allow one to access either XML or HTML input,
    locally or remotely, easily transform it, and save it as HTML or XML (or
    some user-defined format). So I quit whining and wrote one. It's not
    100% finished, but it's a good start and the groundwork for the
    Markup::Content module.

CONVENTIONS
    I will be reopening certain terms to save myself keystrokes and you
    confusion (or does that just create confusion?).

    FILE
        When I mention FILE, what I really mean is either a local or
        remotely mounted file "(i.e - /home/bprudent/this_xml_file.xml)", an
        already opened filehandle, or a remote file location of which
        LWP::Simple's get is capable of, well, getting.

        Note that if you pass an open filehandle to a method that wants to
        read from it, you should open it for reading, and if the method
        wants to write to it, you should open it for writing. Also, we
        cannot write to a remote location (at least, the functionality does
        not exist in this module to do so) so please don't pass a remote
        location to a method that wants to write something (such as the
        save_as method).

    pi  I see alot of people using pi or (p)rocessing (i)nstruction to mean
        a local procressing directive. I am using here and in "TreeNode" to
        mean also server-side instructions, which are often found in the
        wild. Please remember that you will not see these from a remote URL.

ARGUMENTS
    These are the arguments you can specify upon instantiation. In most
    cases you can also set them yourself after you have an object of this
    class via $tree->{'the_option'} = $whatever.

    markup
        Valid options are 'xml' or 'html'. This just specifies which parser
        to use. I would like to, in the future, add more parsers to this
        list. The default is 'html', which is much more forgiving.

    parser_options
        This parameters requests an anonymous hash with parser-specific
        options. If you specified 'xml' for markup then the "parser_options"
        argument will be passed to XML::Parser. Otherwise it will go to
        HTML::TreeBuilder.

    no_squash_whitespace
        There are three modes to this argument:

        mode 0
            Squash all whitespace. This is the default mode.

        mode 1
            Set "no_squash_whitespace" to a true value to keep the tree as
            close to the original document as possible.

        mode 2
            Set "no_squash_whitespace" to an anonymous array containing
            tagnames of which you want to preserve. This is handy when
            re-creating or transforming HTML documents containing
            pre-formatted text, such as "script", "style", "pre", or,
            sometimes, "code". It is also wise to include the fabricated
            tag, pi. This is the tag that is made up when either <% or <? is
            encountered, except when within quotes. See Also
            Markup::TreeNode for a bit more on this.

        Example:

                my $tree = Markup::Tree->new ( no_squash_whitespace => [qw(script style pre code)] );

    no_indent
        It's all in the name. This value affects only (as of now) the
        save_as method. Again, there are three operating modes:

        mode 0
            Leave indentation on. This is the default mode.

        mode 1
            Setting "no_indent" to a true value will never indent.

        mode 2
            Set "no_indent" to an anonymous array containing tagnames of
            which you want to not indent. This is normally the same value as
            no_squash_whitespace.

METHODS
    get_node (description)
        Arguments:

        description
            Description must be one of the following: "first", "last",
            "start", "end", "copy-of", "copy", "copy_of", or "root".

            first
                Causes the method to return the first node in the tree, not
                including the "root" node. This is the first actual element
                found in the markup source.

            last
                Causes the method to return the last node in the tree.

            start
                An alias for "first".

            end An alias for "last".

            copy-of
                Returns a copy of the entire tree. This allows you to have
                two copies in memory. One that you can chop to bits and
                another that you can preserve.

            copy
                An alias for "copy-of".

            copy_of
                An alias for "copy-of".

            root
                Causes the method to return the root node. This is
                equivalant to $tree->tree.

        Example:

                my $first_node = $tree->get_node('first');
                print "The first node in the tree is a ".$first_node->{'tagname'}." node.\n";

    parse_file (FILE)
        Arguments:

        FILE to be parsed

        Example:

                $tree->parse_file ('http://lackluster.tzo.com:1024');
                # or
                $tree->parse_file (\*INPUT);
                # or
                $tree->parse_file ('/home/lackluster/public_html/index.html');

        Returns: a refrence to the parser so that you can say things like

                $tree = Markup::Tree->new()->parse_file('noname.html');

        Note that this will close the file(handle).

    parse (DATA)
        Just the same as HTML or XML ::Parse's parse method. Pass in markup
        data. For HTML you will need to call eof().

        Returns: a refrence to the parser

    eof ( )
        Signals the end of HTML markup. Calling eof on XML data will not
        generate an error, it just won't do anything.

        Returns: a refrence to the parser

    save_as (FILE [, type])
        Saves the tree to FILE as type, if specified.

        Arguments:

        FILE
            This is the filename or handle to write the information in. If
            this argument is textual, the method will try to guess, based on
            the file extension, the second argument if not present.

        type
            Valid values are 'html' or 'xml'. Will also accept 'xhtml'.
            Default is 'html'.

        Example: $tree->save_as
        ('/home/lackluster/public_html/transformed.html.xml', 'xml');

    foreach_node (start_CODE [, end_CODE] [, start_from])
        Loops through each node in the syntax tree, calling "start_CODE"
        and, if present, end_CODE. This method makes looping through the
        tree really quite simple and lends itself well to saving files to
        your own format.

        Arguments:

        start_CODE
            This CODE ref will be called when a node is encounted and before
            its children have been processed. A Markup::TreeNode element
            will be passed to your sub.

        end_CODE
            If this parameter is present, then the CODE ref will be called
            after a node is encountered and after its children have been
            processed. If end_CODE is not a CODE ref, but instead a
            Markup::TreeNode, the method will interpret "end_CODE" as
            "start_from".

        start_from
            Instead of looping over the whole tree, this value can be a
            Markup::TreeNode start point. (See "BUGS" section)

            Example: $tree->foreach_node( sub { my $node = shift();
            indent($node->{'level'}); print $node->{'tagname'}."\n"; }, sub
            { my $node = shift(); indent($node->{'level'}); print
            $node->{'tagname'}."\n"; } );

        RETURN VALUES MATTER!

        Returning a false value will end the iterations and cause the method
        to return. Return true to keep processing.

    copy_of
        Returns a copy, not a reference, of the tree.

CAVEATS
    This module isn't really the best for people who don't often use markup.
    It requires quite a few modules (I actually feed bad about the module
    requirements), and "HTML::TreeBuilder" or "XML::Parser" is probably a
    better choice for most things you want to do. On the upside, if you
    already have these modules, it is a comparativly easy way to use markup.

BUGS || UNFINISHED
    "Wide character in print" warnings are abound. I haven't taken the time
    to look into this. Something about UNICODE?

    The "foreach_node" method doesn't behave properly when passed the
    start_from parameter. That's what I thought, at least. The behaviour may
    work for you in your situation. Just know that it may change in the
    future unless anyone requests otherwise.

    Please inform me of other bugs.
