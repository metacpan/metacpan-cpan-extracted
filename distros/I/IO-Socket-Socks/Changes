0.65
====
   - Fix tests failures on OS X (#rt97619)
   - Clean up documentation a little bit

0.64
====
   - start_SOCKS() method added

0.63
====
   - Ignore SIGPIPE on write
   - $SOCKS_ERROR is readonly now
   - Ability to make server which understands both 4 and 5 version on the same port
   - version() method added
   - Prevent recreation of the passed socket by new_from_fd/new_from_socket

0.62
====
  - Some tests didn't work without internet connection because of the resolving on client side. Fixed
  - New socket after server accept didn't inherit SocksResolve parameter. Fixed
  - Removed automatically resolving hostname to ip in socks4a server accept. This should be done in the program, not in this library
  - command() on the server side now in addition returns address type as last value (ADDR_DOMAINNAME or ADDR_IPV4)
  - Fix for $! test on Solaris and ready() time measurement on OpenBSD

0.61
====
  - Set $! to ESOCKPROTO (new module constant) on error in the protocol
  - Set $@ on error
  - $SOCKS_ERROR now behaves more like $!: string or number in appropriate contexts
  - Return socket to non-blocking state after new_from_fd if socket was non-blocking before

0.60
====
  - Added support for non-blocking clients accept on the server side
  - new_from_fd() is now alias to new_from_socket()

0.51
====

0.3
===
  - clarified the issue with the license (Bug #44047)
  - socks bind support added
  - improvements in the documentation
