=head1 all_entities_Contig

Return all instances of the Contig entity.

A contig is thought of as composing a part of the DNA associated with a specific
genome.  It is represented as an ID (including the genome ID) and a ContigSequence.
We do not think of strings of DNA from, say, a metgenomic sample as "contigs",
since there is no associated genome (these would be considered ContigSequences).
This use of the term "ContigSequence", rather than just "DNA sequence", may turn out
to be a bad idea.  For now, you should just realize that a Contig has an associated
genome, but a ContigSequence does not.


Example:

    all_entities_Contig -a 

would retrieve all entities of type Contig and include all fields
in the entities in the output.

=head2 Related entities

The Contig entity has the following relationship links:

=over 4
    
=item HasAsSequence ContigSequence

=item HasVariationIn ObservationalUnit

=item IsComponentOf Genome

=item IsImpactedBy Trait

=item IsLocusFor Feature

=item IsSummarizedBy AlleleFrequency


=back


=head2 Command-Line Options

=over 4

=item -a

Return all fields.

=item -h

Display a list of the fields available for use.

=item -fields field-list

Choose a set of fields to return. Field-list is a comma-separated list of 
strings. The following fields are available:

=over 4

=item source_id

=back    
   
=back

=head2 Output Format

The standard output is a tab-delimited file. It consists of the input
file with an extra column added for each requested field.  Input lines that cannot
be extended are written to stderr.
