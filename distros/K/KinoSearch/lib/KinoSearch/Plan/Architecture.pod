=head1 NAME

KinoSearch::Plan::Architecture - Configure major components of an index.

=head1 DEPRECATED

The KinoSearch code base has been assimilated by the Apache L<Lucy> project.
The "KinoSearch" namespace has been deprecated, but development continues
under our new name at our new home: L<http://lucy.apache.org/>

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    package MyArchitecture;
    use base qw( KinoSearch::Plan::Architecture );

    use KSx::Index::ZlibDocWriter;
    use KSx::Index::ZlibDocReader;

    sub register_doc_writer {
        my ( $self, $seg_writer ) = @_; 
        my $doc_writer = KSx::Index::ZlibDocWriter->new(
            snapshot   => $seg_writer->get_snapshot,
            segment    => $seg_writer->get_segment,
            polyreader => $seg_writer->get_polyreader,
        );  
        $seg_writer->register(
            api       => "KinoSearch::Index::DocReader",
            component => $doc_writer,
        );  
        $seg_writer->add_writer($doc_writer);
    }

    sub register_doc_reader {
        my ( $self, $seg_reader ) = @_; 
        my $doc_reader = KSx::Index::ZlibDocReader->new(
            schema   => $seg_reader->get_schema,
            folder   => $seg_reader->get_folder,

            component => $doc_reader,
        );  
    }
 
    package MySchema;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

By default, a KinoSearch index consists of several main parts: lexicon,
postings, stored documents, deletions, and highlight data.  The readers and
writers for that data are spawned by Architecture.  Each component operates
at the segment level; Architecture's factory methods are used to build up
L<SegWriter|KinoSearch::Index::SegWriter> and
L<SegReader|KinoSearch::Index::SegReader>.

=head1 CONSTRUCTORS

=head2 new()

    my $arch = KinoSearch::Plan::Architecture->new;

Constructor.  Takes no arguments.
