Changes

V0.16  Use Module::Build and Test::More
       Fix CPAN Testers failure with no X display

V0.15  Tweak the way that fonts are specified in TextANSIColor
       such that the Tk::Font system is used.

V0.14  Add getansi() method from Jim Turner <turnerjw2@netscape.net>
       and related test. This allows the ANSI escape codes to be retrieved
       from the Text widget.

V0.13  Forgot to include Tk::ROTextANSIColor in the MANIFEST!

V0.12  Add Read-only widget Tk::ROTextANSIColor at request of
       Piotr Synowiec <mysiar@krakow.sky.pl>
