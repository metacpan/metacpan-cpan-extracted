0.13
  - got permissions for Schedule::Cron::Events from PKent,
    removed module from snaked distribution.

0.12
  - fixed unresolved dependency: moved Schedule::Cron::Events
    into snaked distribution (it was deleted from CPAN, thanks).

0.11
  - more accurate timing (using MONOTONIC clock where possible,
    thanks to tejblum@yandex-team.ru); using "sleep 1" on FreeBSD
    as Time::HiRes::usleep(1_000_000) block sometimes for several hours :(

  - --detailed-status (similar to that which innodb makes)

  - command-line configuration manipulation (by andozer@yandex-team.ru)

  - eliminated memory leak while rereading configuration
    (which lead to extensive daemon memory usage over time)

  - lots of small improvements
