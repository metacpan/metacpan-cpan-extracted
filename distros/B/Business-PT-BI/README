      # ...
    }

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=head2 valid_bi

Validates Portuguese BI's.

A Portuguese BI number is comprised by eight digits. Between that
number and the "issue" box, the card also has a small box with a
single digit. That's the control digit. In order to validate a
Portuguese BI, you have to provide C<valid_bi> with the BI number and
the control digit.

  valid_bi( $bi, $control_number );

Validation is done as follows:

 1) BI is matched with /^\d{8}$/ (eigth consecutive digits with
    nothing more)
 2) First digit is multiplied by 9, second by 8, third by 7, fourth by
    6, fifth by 5, sixth by 4, seventh by 3, eighth by 2
 3) All the results of the multiplication are summed
 4) Modulo of the sum by 11 is found
 5) Complement of the sum by 11 is found
 6) Control digit is compared to said complement

Example for BI 12345678, with control digit 9:

 1) BI is matched with /^\d{8}/, test passes
 2) Multiplication: 1*9, 2*8, 3*7, 4*6, 5*5, 6*4, 7*3, 8*2
 3) Sum: 156
 4) 156 % 11 = 2
 5) 11 - 2 = 9
 6) 9 == 9, test passes

When the complement (the result of step 5) is greater than 9, the
number is assumed to be 0.
