NAME
    App::Prove::Dist - Prove that a Perl Module Dist is OK for CPAN

SYNOPSIS
        prove-dist                      # make dist; unzip dist;
                                        # test against core-only + custom-locallib
        prove-dist test --perl=5.14.1   # use a specific perl
        prove-dist test --perl=5.10.1 --perl=5.12.0 --perl=5.14.2
        prove-dist list                 # list your defined dependencies
        prove-dist scan                 # scan for your required dependencies
        prove-dist make --perl=...      # make a custom locallib for your dist
                                          # and your perl. prove-dist will look 
                                          # for this lib when you test your dist
        prove-dist wipe --perl=...      # delete the custom locallib
        prove-dist perls                # list perls to test against

DESCRIPTION
    When releasing a Perl module distribution, it is good to test it on a
    clean perl installation and on muliple versions of installed perl. Many
    modules have dependency modules, so a truly clean Perl won't work. You
    can use locallib to work around that. You'll need to set up a locallib
    for each version of perl, for each module you release.

    App::Prove::Dist does all this for you:

        cd your-dist-dir
        prove-dist perls                # Get a list of perls to use
        prove-dist make --perl=5.14.2   # Create a custom locallib for a perl
        prove-dist perls                # List now shows locallib
        prove-dist test --perl=5.14.2   # Prove against clean perl + new locallib

    "prove-dist" will use "lib-core-only" and your custom locallib to prove
    your "t/" tests, so you can be more certain it will pass cpantesters.

STATUS
    THIS IS A ROUGH DRAFT AND PROOF OF CONCEPT RELEASE! DON'T USE IT YET!

    Currently:

        * Only likes Unix
        * Only likes perlbrew
        * Many hardcoded assumptions
        * Scan not implemented
        * Not fully configurable
        * Will probably push your grandmother down the stairs

    Suggestions and patches welcome!
