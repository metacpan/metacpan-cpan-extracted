NAME

    Photography::EV - Calculate exposure value (EV)

VERSION

    version 0.07

SYNOPSIS

     use Photography::EV;
     my $ev = ev(5.6, 1/1000); # EV for f/5.6 at 1/1000s

DESCRIPTION

    This module provides functions for calculating photographic exposure
    values. Some light meters can give readings in "Exposure Value" or EV.
    On some cameras the exposure can be locked into a specific Exposure
    Value (EV), such that changing the aperture or shutter speed will
    adjust the shutter speed or aperture to maintain the same exposure.

FUNCTIONS

 ev

     my $ev = ev($aperture, $time);

    Takes the aperture (f-stop) and shutter speed (in seconds). Returns the
    integer Exposure Value (EV).

 aperture

     my $aperture = aperture($ev, $time);
     my $aperture = aperture($ev, $time, \@apertures);

    Returns the correct aperture corresponding to the given EV and shutter
    speed (in seconds). By default returns the closest full stop aperture
    between 1 and 64.

    If the optional third argument is given (a reference to a list of
    possible aperture values), then the returned aperture will be the
    closest possible from that list. This is helpful, for example, when you
    are using a lens that provides fractions of a stop. My Nikkor 50mm
    f/1.2 for example has stops at f/1.2, f/1.4, f/2, f/4 f/5.6, f/8, f/11
    and f/16, so to get the correct aperture for 1/60 at EV 9 for that
    lens:

     my $aperture = aperture(9, 1/60, [1.2,1.4,2,4,5.6,8,11,16]);

 shutter_speed

     my $time = shutter_speed($ev, $aperture);
     my $time = shutter_speed($ev, $aperture, \@times);

    Returns the correct shutter speed (in seconds) corresponding to the
    given EV and aperture. By default returns the closest full stop between
    1920s (32 minutes) and 1/8000s.

    If the optional third argument is given (a reference to a list of
    possible shutter speeds), then the returned shutter speed will be the
    closest possible from that list. This is helpful for older cameras that
    have a different set of shutter speed stops, or newer cameras that use
    half stop shutter speeds. At least some Rolleiflex TLRs have shutter
    speeds of 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50, 100, 250, 500 instead of the modern
    values. To get the correct shutter speed for f/3.5 and EV 5:

     # map displayed shutter speed to 1/t to get time in seconds
     my $time = shutter_speed(6, 3.5, [map { 1/$_ } 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50, 100, 250, 500]);
