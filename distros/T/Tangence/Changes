         * Support floating-point numbers as a native format
         * Pack/unpack smashed objects using type-specific serialisation

        [BUGFIXES]
         * Quiet 'experimental' warnings about given/when

0.18    BUGFIXES:
         * Handle void-returning method signatures correctly
           (RT#83637)

0.17    CHANGES:
         * Minimal minor version 2
         * Expose ->class and ->can_method / ->can_event / ->can_property
           on both Tangence::Object and Tangence::ObjectProxy

0.16    CHANGES:
         * Bumped wire protocol minor version to 3:
            + Support GETPROPELEM operation
            + Support WATCH_ITER for queue property iteration
         * Internal rewrites to some unit tests for neatness

0.15    BUGFIXES:
         * Fix Tangence::Message on clientside when dealing with minor
           version 2 servers, by actually 'use'ing classes it requires

         * Bumped wire protocol minor version to 2:
            + Provide wire-level struct record serialisations
            + Encode classes as structs rather than use introspection dict
         * Recognise struct definitions in the tanfile parser

           is no longer supported

0.13    CHANGES:
         * Bumped wire protocol minor version to 1:
            + Encode strings on the wire (dict keys and class names) as
              Tangence strings
            + Give classes ID numbers to refer to in CONSTRUCT messages,
              rather then full class name every time

0.12    CHANGES:
         * Defined MSG_INIT for server/client version negitiations
         * Implement it in the server, but not yet in the client as it crashes

         * Further improvements to metadata layer

         * Redesign of metadata layer to use real objects rather than
           unblessed hashrefs for structural information
         * Optionally parse (but currently ignore) argument names in methods
           and events
         * Created a parse+dump script to test the parser

         * Added some initial documentation to Tangence::Stream, ::Client and
           ::Server
