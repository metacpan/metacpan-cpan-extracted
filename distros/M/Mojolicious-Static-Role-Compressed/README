NAME

    Mojolicious::Static::Role::Compressed - Role for Mojolicious::Static
    that serves pre-compressed versions of static assets

STATUS

SYNOPSIS

      # Defaults to serving br assets (with extension ".br"), then gzip (with extension ".gz"),
      # then falls back to the uncompressed asset. By default, this will not look for
      # compressed versions of PDF, PNG, GIF, JP(E)G, or WEBP files since these files
      # are already compressed.
      $app->static->with_roles('+Compressed');
    
      # Mojolicious::Lite
      app->static->with_roles('+Compressed');
    
      # or
      $app->static(Mojolicious::Static->new->with_roles('+Compressed'));
    
      # Don't use the defaults
      $app->static
          ->with_roles('+Compressed')
          ->compression_types(['br', {ext => 'gzip', encoding => 'gzip'}]) # default ext for gzip is 'gz'. This could also be done as ['br', 'gzip']
          ->should_serve_asset(sub { $_->path =~ /\.(html|js|css)$/i }); # only try to serve compressed html, js, and css assets. $_ contains a Mojo::Asset::File
    
      # Look for compressed versions of all assets
      $app->static
          ->with_roles('+Compressed')
          ->should_serve_asset(sub { 1 });
    
      # Or just pass in 1 to look for compressed versions of all assets (slightly faster)
      $app->static
          ->with_roles('+Compressed')
          ->should_serve_asset(1);

DESCRIPTION

    Mojolicious::Static::Role::Compressed is a role for Mojolicious::Static
    that provides the ability to serve pre-compressed versions of static
    asset. Mojolicious::Static::Role::Compressed does this by using the
    before method modifier on "serve_asset" in Mojolicious::Static and
    "is_fresh" in Mojolicious::Static. A static asset will be served when
    all of the following conditions are met:

      * The asset passed to "serve_asset" in Mojolicious::Static is a
      Mojo::Asset::File ("is_file" in Mojo::Asset returns 1).

      * It is determined that the asset should be served by
      "should_serve_asset" being a true scalar value or a subroutine that
      returns true for the given Mojo::Asset::File.

      * "accept_encoding" in Mojo::Headers for the request contains at
      least one encoding listed in "compression_types".

      * A compressed version of the asset is found that is smaller than the
      original asset. Assets are expected to be located at the path of the
      original asset, followed by a period and the extension:
      /path/to/asset.css -> /path/to/asset.css.gz

    Mojolicious::Static::Role::Compressed uses the same modified time as
    the original asset when setting "last_modified" in Mojo::Headers in the
    response, and modifies the ETag ("etag" in Mojo::Headers) in the
    response by appending "-$encoding" (i.e. "etag-gzip"), where the
    encoding is specified in "compression_types". This is in line with
    RFC-7232 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7232#section-2.3.3>, which
    explicitly states that ETags should be content-coding aware.

ATTRIBUTES

 compression_types

      $app->static
          ->with_roles('+Compressed)
          ->compression_types(['br', {ext => 'gz', encoding => 'gzip'}]); # This is the default

    Compression types accepts an arrayref made up of strings and/or
    hashrefs. Strings will be used as both the file extension and the
    encoding type. The encoding type is what is used and expected in
    request and response headers to specify the encoding. Below is an
    example of this and the default for "compression_types":

      ['br', {ext => 'gz', encoding => 'gzip'}]

    This means that br is both the extension used when looking for
    compressed assets, and the encoding used in headers. Internally, 'br'
    will be converted to {ext = 'br', encoding => 'br'}>, and this is how
    it will appear if you call "compression_types" as a getter.

    Assets are expected to be located at the path of the original asset,
    followed by a period and the extension: /path/to/asset.css ->
    /path/to/asset.css.gz

    Compression types will be checked for in the order they are specified,
    with the first one that matches all of the requirements in
    "DESCRIPTION" being used. "compression_types" cannot be changed once
    Mojo::Static begins serving compressed assets ("serve_asset" in
    Mojo::Static is called, either directly or indirectly, such as by
    "serve" in Mojo::Static, and we succeed in finding and serving a
    compressed asset). If you want to change these when the app is already
    running, you should create a new Mojolicious::Static object and add the
    role and your "compression_types" again. I'm not sure why you would
    want to change this once the app is already running and serving assets,
    and this may cause assets that are being served in compressed chunks to
    be re-served as the uncompressed asset or a different compressed asset.

    ext and encoding must be unique across different compression types.

 should_serve_asset

      $app->static
          ->with_roles('+Compressed)
          ->should_serve_asset(sub { $_->path !~ /\.(pdf|jpe?g|gif|png|webp)$/i }); # This is the default
    
      # subroutine returning 1 means try to serve compressed versions of all assets.
      $app->static
          ->with_roles('+Compressed)
          ->should_serve_asset(sub { 1 });
    
      # using 1 directly also tries to serve compressed versions of all assets and is slightly faster
      $app->static
          ->with_roles('+Compressed')
          ->should_serve_asset(1);

    "should_serve_asset" is a subroutine (or scalar) that determines
    whether or not Mojolicious::Static::Role::Compressed should attempt to
    serve a compressed version of a Mojo::Asset::File. If it is a
    subroutine, $_ is set to the Mojo::Asset::File that will be served. The
    default is to not look for compressed versions of any assets whose
    "path" in Mojo::Asset::File indicates that it is a pdf, jpg, gif, png,
    or webp file, as these file types are already compressed:

      sub { $_->path !~ /\.(pdf|jpe?g|gif|png|webp)$/i }) # default for should_serve_asset

    To look for compressed versions of all assets, set "should_serve_asset"
    to a subroutine that always returns 1:

      $app->static
          ->with_roles('+Compressed)
          ->should_serve_asset(sub { 1 });

    Or you can set "should_serve_asset" to 1, which is slightly faster:

      $app->static
          ->with_roles('+Compressed')
          ->should_serve_asset(1);

    Setting "should_serve_asset" to a scalar that evaluates to false, such
    as undef, will cause a warning. If "should_serve_asset" is a false
    scalar, there is no point in loading
    Mojolicious::Static::Role::Compressed.

RESERVED STASH KEYS

    Mojolicious::Static::Role::Compressed uses the stash keys
    mojolicious_static_role_compressed.asset and
    mojolicious_static_role_compressed.compression_type internally, so
    these should not be used by elsewhere in the Mojolicious app. There are
    no plans for other stash keys, but other keys under
    mojolicious_static_role_compressed.* should be avoided when using this
    role.
