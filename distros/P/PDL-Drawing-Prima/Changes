0.14_01 MTH XX, 2022

0.14 Feb 13, 2022

  [ENHANCEMENTS]
  
  * Now includes a real test! t/10 uses the Prima/Perl interface and the
    pdl interface to draw what should be identical things---lines of
    various colors. It then performs a pixel-by-pixel comparison to make
    sure you get the exact same result. Much more needs to be written
    but now at least I have the template.

  [DEPENDENCIES]
  
  * Bumped required verson of PDL to v2.037. Should have done this with the
    release of v0.13, but that was a bit hasty. Oops. This is the required
    minimum version mostly because some versions of PDL earlier than
    v2.037 made changes to PDL::PP that broke the compilation of this
    distribution. The changes to PDL::PP were fixed with v2.037.
  
  [BUG FIXES]
  
  * Fixed a minor bug that caused PDL::Drawing::Prima::Utils to not compile
    on some platforms. Should have used pp_line_numbers, but rolled my own
    in a few spots for some reason.

0.13 Feb 09, 2022

  [BUG FIXES]
  
  * Prima changed fillWinding to fillMode, which required a change to
    PDL::Drawing::Prima's interface. Thanks to dk for this fix!

  [DEPENDENCIES]
  
  * Bumped required verson of Prima to 1.57

0.12 Aug 01, 2016

  [BUG FIXES]
  
  * PDL::PP now requires a call to pp_done, which was missing in Utils

0.11 Nov 07, 2015

  [BUG FIXES]
  
  * Fixed backwards-compatible support code, which wasn't actually fully
    backwards compatible as written.
  
  * Update Build.PL to work with newest PDL.
  
  [DEVELOPMENT]
  
  * Added Travis support for github repository


0.10 Oct 28, 2013

  [ENHANCEMENTS]
  
  * Added backwards-compatible support for PDL v2.007.
  
  * Hacked an improved symbol drawing for crosses and triangles. It sometimes
    happened that the bottom leg of a cross symbol wasn't straight down due to
    rounding a floating-point number that is slightly less than the integer it
    was supposed to be. This hack makes it work slightly better, though an even
    better algorithm would be preferred.
  
  * Added a Changes file.
  
  * Revised PDL::Drawing::Prima::Utils::minmaxforpair() to use standard
    functions in math.h for determining whether a value is finite or not.
  
  [BUG FIXES]
  
  * Fixed corner-case in PDL::Drawing::Prima::Utils::hsv_to_rgb.



0.09 Jan 4, 2013

  [BUG FIXES]
  
  * Fixed Build.PL's linking; now should work on Cygin and Strawberry.



0.08 Sep 9, 2012

  [BUG FIXES]
  
  * Fixed Windows runtime link error.
  
  [DEPENDENCIES]
  
  * Bumped required verson of Prima to 1.35



0.07 Aug 6, 2012
  
  [API CHANGES]
  
  * Deprecated PDL::Drawing::Prima::pdl_of_handles_for()
  
  [DIFFERENT BEHAVIOR]
    
  * Drawing operations are now atomic!! Now, when you call pdl-based drawing
   function on a Prima drawable, the drawable's state will be restored to its
   original state before the function returns.
  
  [ENHANCEMENTS]
  
  * Documentation for the properties supported by a drawing operation are now
    guaranteed to be correct because they are extracted directly from the
    documentation.
  
  [DEPENDENCIES]
  
  * Added minimum version for Module::Build (0.28)
  
  * Bumped minimum version for PDL to 2.4.10
  
  * Added runtime Prima version check

  [NEW FEATURES]
  
  * Added fillPattern property to applicable drawing functions.
