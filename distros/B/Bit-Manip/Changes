Revision history for Bit-Manip

1.04    2017-07-23
        - replaced all calls to pow() with bit shift operations instead,
          breaking reliance on stdint.h (closes #10)
        - renamed bit_toggle() to bit_tog(), left an alias for backward
          compatibility purposes (closes #8)
        - add the parameter lists to the functions in POD (closes #9)
        - changed to the older way of using Exporter (closes #7)
        - added note in DESCRIPTION that we also have a pure Perl version
          (closes #6)
        - verified $msb can equal $lsb in bit_get(), and added tests to ensure
          it (closes #2)
        - added tests to ensure bit_tog() does the right thing

1.03    2017-02-09
        - added bit_clr() (per PerlMonks discussion), clears selected bits
        - changed $bits param name to $nbits in code and POD as it makes it less
          ambiguous as to what we mean by the arg
        - added t/45 for testing bit_clr()

1.02    2016-01-27
        - removed erroneous "use feature 'say';" from test files, as it was
          causing Testers to break on versions < v5.10.x

1.01    2016-01-25
        - somehow I missed adding POD for the changes in bit_set()

1.00    2016-01-25
        - removed string.h include as we don't use it
        - LSB can now be equal to MSB to allow getting a single bit
        - fix issue where bit_set() was not updating bits if a leading zero was
          sent in. We now require a 'bits' param (fixes #1)

0.02    2017-01-25
        - added in EXPORT_OK POD section
        - code tidying in the XS file
        - changed all instances of "first" to msb and "last" to lsb for
          params
        - added bit_mask() returns the bit mask given a number of bits and LSB

0.01    2017-01-24
        First version, released on an unsuspecting world.
