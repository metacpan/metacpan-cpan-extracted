       my $name   = lc $kid->{Name};
       foreach my $photo_id (map { $_->{Photo} || () } @{ $dc->kid_status($kid_id)->{list} })
       {
         my $dest = path("~/Pictures/dc/$name-$photo_id.jpg");
         next if -f $dest;
         print "new photo: $dest\n";
         $dest->parent->mkpath;
         $dc->photo($photo_id, $dest);
       }
     }

DESCRIPTION

    NOTE: I no longer use DailyConnect, and happy to let someone who does
    need it maintain it. This module is otherwise unsupported.

    Interface to DailyConnect, which is a service that can provide
    information about your kids at daycare. This is more or less a port of
    a node API that I found here:

    https://github.com/Flet/dailyconnect

    I wrote this module for more or less the same reasons as that author,
    although I wanted to be able to use it in perl.

    It uses HTTP::AnyUA, so should work with any Perl user agent supported
    by that layer.

ATTRIBUTES

 ua

    An instance of HTTP::AnyUA. If a user agent supported by HTTP::AnyUA
    (such as HTTP::Tiny or LWP::UserAgent) is provided, a new instance of
    HTTP::AnyUA will wrap around that user agent instance. The only
    requirement is that the underlying user agent must support cookies.

    If a ua attribute is not provided, then an instance of HTTP::AnyUA will
    be created wrapped around a LWP::UserAgent using the default proxy and
    a cookie jar.

 base_url

    The base URL for daily connect. The default should be correct.

 req

    The most recent request. The format of the request object is subject to
    change, and therefore should only be used for debugging.

 res

    The most recent response. The format of the response object is subject
    to change, and therefore should only be used for debugging.

 METHODS

    Beside login, methods typically return a hash or file content depending
    on the type of object requested. On error they return undef. Further
    details for the failure can be deduced from the response object stored
    in res above.

 login

     my $bool = $dc->login($email, $pass);

    Login to daily connect using the given email and password. The
    remaining methods only work once you have successfully logged in.

 user_info

     my $hash = $dc->user_info;

    Get a hash of the user information.

 kid_summary

     my $hash = $dc->kid_summary($kid_id);

    Get today's summary for the given kid.

 kid_summary_by_date

     my $hash = $dc->kid_summary_by_date($kid_id, $date);

    Get the summary for the given kid on the given day. $date is in the
    form YYMMDD.

 kid_status

     my $hash = $dc->kid_status($kid_id);

    Get today's status for the given kid.

 kid_status_by_date

     my $hash = $dc->kid_status_by_date($kid_id, $date);

    Get the status for the given kid on the given date. $date is in the
    form YYMMDD.

 photo

     $dc->photo($photo_id);
     $dc->photo($photo_id, $dest);

    Get the photo with the given $photo_id. If $dest is not provided then
    the content of the photo in JPEG format will be returned. If $dest is a
    scalar reference, then the content will be stored in that scalar. If
    $dest is a string, then that string will be assumed to be a file, and
    the photo will be saved there. If a Path::Tiny or Path::Class::File
    object are passed in, then the content will be written to the files at
    that location.

CAVEATS

    DailyConnect does not provide a standard RESTful API, so it is entirely
    possible they might change the interface of their app, and break this
    module.

    My kiddo is an only child so I haven't been able to test this for more
    than one kiddo. May be a problem if you have twins or septuplets.
