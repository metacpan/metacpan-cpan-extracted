OpenTracing::Interface::ScopeManager - A role that defines the ScopeManager

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    package OpenTracing::Implementation::MyBackendService::ScopeManager;
        
    sub activate_span {
        ...
    }
    
    sub get_active_scope {
        ...
    }
    
    BEGIN {
        use Role::Tiny::With;
        with 'OpenTracing::Interface::ScopeManager'
            if $ENV{OPENTRACING_INTERFACE};
    } # check at compile time, perl -c will work
    
    1;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This 'role' describes the interface for any OpenTracing ScopeManager
implementation.

The C<ScopeManager> interface abstracts both the activation of C<Span> instances
via L<activate_Span> and access to an active C<Scope> via L<get_active_scope>.



=head1 INSTANCE METHODS



=head2 activate_span( $span, %options )

Set the specified C<Span> as the active instance for the current context
(usually a thread).

    my $span = $tracer->start_span( 'some operation'
        ignore_active_span => 1
    );
    
    my $manager = $tracer->get_scope_manager;
    
    my $scope = $manager->activate_span( $span,
        finish_span_on_close => 0
    );

The returned C<Scope> represents the active state for the span. Once its active
period is due, C<< $scope->close() >> ought to be called.
Observe the span will be automatically finished when C<< $scope->close() >> is
called.

=head3 Required Positional Parameters

=over

=item Span

An object that does the C<Span> interface.

=back

=head3 Named Options

=over

=item finish_span_on_close

A C<Bool> when set to false, the C<Span> will not be automatically finished when
the C<Scope> has been closed. This is 'true' by default.

=back

=head3 Returns

An object that implements the C<Scope> interface.



=head2 get_active_scope

Return the currently active C<Scope> which can be used to access the
currently active C<Span>, using C<< $scope->get_span >>.

    my $manager = $tracer->get_scope_manager;
    
    my $scope = $manager->get_activate_scope;

=head3 Parameters

none

=head3 Returns

The C<Scope> that is currently active or undef if none is yet active.

=item L<OpenTracing::Interface>

Describes the API definition for OpenTransport implementations written in the

all common elements that conform L<OpenTracing::Interface>

=head1 CAVEATS

This description is using C<around> method modifiers that basically wraps them
around the real implementation. These method modifiers provide a 'readable' and
reusable interface, describing the inputs and outputs, using type constraints.

Consumers of this role, or implementors of the interface are MUST implement each
method mentioned below. Not doing so will result in compilation errors.

Since this role does nothing else than checking input and output, it is useful
during development. Most likely it can be switched off safely in production
environments.
