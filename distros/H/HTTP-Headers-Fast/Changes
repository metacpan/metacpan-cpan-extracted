    - Strip out empty lines separated by CRLF.(markstos)
      Before the patch, an embedded CRLF would be allowed through with a
      space added after it. This is spec-compliant but appears not to be
      the intent, based on the regex to remove empty lines in headers.  If
      a client accepted "CRLF\sCRLF\s" as a valid header end, then a CRLF
      injection attack would have been possible.
      (This patch was ported from the HTTP::Headers git repo. )

      The possiblity of the former behavior exploitably seems particular
      small. Apache won't even send out header that a space between
      the two required CRLFs.
