           Installation instructions for Class::Container

To install this module, follow the standard steps for installing most
Perl modules:

  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test
  make install

Or you may use the newer Module::Build-style installation script:

  perl Build.PL
  ./Build
  ./Build test
  ./Build install

Or you may use the CPAN.pm module, which will automatically execute
these steps for you.
