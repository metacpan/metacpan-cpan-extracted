NAME
    Pod::Weaver::Section::Availability - Add an AVAILABILITY pod section

VERSION
    version 1.20

SYNOPSIS
    In "weaver.ini":

        [Availability]

OVERVIEW
    This section plugin will produce a hunk of Pod that refers the user to
    the distribution's homepage and development versions.

    You need to use Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Bugtracker and
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Homepage in your "dist.ini" file, because this
    plugin relies on information those other plugins generate.

METHODS
  weave_section
    Adds the "AVAILABILITY" section.
