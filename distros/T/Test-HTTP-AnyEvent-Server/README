SYNOPSIS

        #!/usr/bin/env perl
        use common::sense;
    
        use AnyEvent::HTTP;
        use Test::HTTP::AnyEvent::Server;
    
        my $server = Test::HTTP::AnyEvent::Server->new;
        my $cv = AE::cv;
    
        $cv->begin;
        http_request GET => $server->uri . q(echo/head), sub {
            my ($body, $hdr) = @_;

        };
    
        $cv->wait;

DESCRIPTION

    This package provides a simple NON-forking HTTP server which can be
    used for testing HTTP clients.

ATTRIBUTES

 address

    Address to bind the server. Defaults to 127.0.0.1.

 port

    Port to bind the server. Picks the first available by default.

 maxconn

    Limit the number of accepted connections to this. Default: 10.

 timeout

    Timeout connection after this number of seconds. Default: 60.

 disable_proxy

    Reset the proxy-controlling environment variables
    (no_proxy/http_proxy/ftp_proxy/all_proxy). I guess you don't need a
    proxy to connect to yourself. Default: true.

 https

    (experimental) Accept both HTTP and HTTPS connections on the same port
    (depends on Net::SSLeay). This parameter follows the same rules as the
    tls_ctx parameter to AnyEvent::Handle. Note: HTTPS server mandatorily
    need both certificate and key specified!

 custom_handler

    (experimental) Callback for custom request processing.

        my $server = Test::HTTP::AnyEvent::Server->new(
            custom_handler => sub {
                # HTTP::Response instance
                my ($response) = @_;
                # also carries HTTP::Request!
                if ($response->request->uri eq '/hello') {
                    $response->content('world');
                    return 1;
                } else {
                    # 404 - Not Found
                    return 0;
                }
            },
        );

 forked

    (experimental) Sometimes, you just need to test some blocking code.
    Setting this flag to true will start Test::HTTP::AnyEvent::Server in a
    forked process.

 forked_pid

    (internal) Holds the PID of a child process if "forked" flag was used.

 server

    (internal) Holds the guard object whose lifetime it tied to the TCP
    server.

METHODS

 uri

    Return URI of a newly created server (with a trailing /).

 start_server($prepare_cb)

    (internal) Wrapper for the tcp_server from AnyEvent::Socket.
    $prepare_cb is used to get the IP address and port of the local socket
    endpoint and populate respective attributes.

 _start

    (internal) Start processing the request

 _reply

    (internal) Issue HTTP reply.

FUNCTIONS

 _cleanup

    (internal) Close descriptor and shutdown connection.

INTERFACE

    Mostly borrowed from Test::HTTP::Server.

 GET /echo/head

    Echoes back the issued HTTP request (except the content part):

        $ curl -v http://127.0.0.1:44721/echo/head
        * About to connect() to 127.0.0.1 port 44721 (#0)
        *   Trying 127.0.0.1...
        * connected
        * Connected to 127.0.0.1 (127.0.0.1) port 44721 (#0)
        > GET /echo/head HTTP/1.1

        Host: 127.0.0.1:44721
        Accept: */*
    
        * Closing connection #0

 GET /echo/body

    Echoes back the content part of an issued HTTP POST request:

        $ curl -v -d param1=value1 -d param2=value2 http://127.0.0.1:44721/echo/body
        * About to connect() to 127.0.0.1 port 44721 (#0)
        *   Trying 127.0.0.1...
        * connected
        * Connected to 127.0.0.1 (127.0.0.1) port 44721 (#0)

        * Closing connection #0
        param1=value1&param2=value2

 GET /repeat/5/PADDING

    Mindlessly repeat the specified pattern:

        $ curl -v http://127.0.0.1:44721/repeat/5/PADDING
        * About to connect() to 127.0.0.1 port 44721 (#0)
        *   Trying 127.0.0.1...
        * connected
        * Connected to 127.0.0.1 (127.0.0.1) port 44721 (#0)
        > GET /repeat/5/PADDING HTTP/1.1
        > User-Agent: curl/7.27.0
        > Host: 127.0.0.1:44721
        > Accept: */*
        >
        * HTTP 1.0, assume close after body
        < HTTP/1.0 200 OK
        < Connection: close

        < Content-Type: text/plain
        <
        * Closing connection #0
        PADDINGPADDINGPADDINGPADDINGPADDING

 GET /delay/5

    Holds the response for a specified number of seconds. Useful to test
    the timeout routines:

        $ curl -v http://127.0.0.1:44721/delay/5 && date
        * About to connect() to 127.0.0.1 port 44721 (#0)
        *   Trying 127.0.0.1...
        * connected
        * Connected to 127.0.0.1 (127.0.0.1) port 44721 (#0)
        > GET /delay/5 HTTP/1.1
        > User-Agent: curl/7.27.0
        > Host: 127.0.0.1:44721
        > Accept: */*
        >
        * HTTP 1.0, assume close after body
        < HTTP/1.0 200 OK
        < Connection: close
        < Date: Mon, 15 Oct 2012 19:24:05 GMT
        < Server: Test::HTTP::AnyEvent::Server/0.003 AnyEvent/7.02 Perl/5.016001 (linux)
        < Content-Type: text/plain
        <
        * Closing connection #0
        issued Mon Oct 15 19:24:05 2012
        Mon Oct 15 16:24:10 BRT 2012

    P.S. - not present in Test::HTTP::Server.

    P.P.S. - setting the delay value below the "timeout" value is quite
    pointless.

TODO

      * Implement cookie/index routes from Test::HTTP::Server;

      * Test edge cases for "forked".
