=pod explain

- zing-daemon takes an app (zing process) and backgrounds it
- i.e. runs the zing process in the background
- zing is a Watcher which loads (and forks) a kernel
- the kernel process loads the app (from its scheme)
- the kernel is also a watcher and maintains the specified number of forks
- the supervisor tree is zing -> kernel -> app
