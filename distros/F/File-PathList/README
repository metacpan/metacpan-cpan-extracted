NAME
    File::PathList - Find a file within a set of paths (like @INC or Java
    classpaths)

SYNOPSIS
      # Create a basic pathset
      my $inc  = File::PathList->new( \@INC );
  
      # Again, but with more explicit params
      my $inc2 = File::PathList->new(
            paths => \@INC,
            cache => 1,
            );
  
      # Get the full (localised) path for a unix-style relative path
      my $file = "foo/bar/baz.txt";
      my $path = $inc->find_file( $file );
  
      if ( $path ) {
          print "Found '$file' at '$path'\n";
      } else {
          print "Failed to find '$file'\n";
      }

DESCRIPTION
    Many systems that map generic relative paths to absolute paths do so
    with a set of base paths.

    For example, perl itself when loading classes first turn a "Class::Name"
    into a path like "Class/Name.pm", and thens looks through each element
    of @INC to find the actual file.

    To aid in portability, all relative paths are provided as unix-style
    relative paths, and converted to the localised version in the process of
    looking up the path.

EXTENDING
    The recommended method for extending "File::PathList" is to add
    additional topic-specific find methods.

    For example, a subclass that was attempting to duplicate the
    functionality of perl's @INC and module location may wish to add a
    "find_module" method.

METHODS
  new \@path | param => $value, ...
    The "new" constructor creates a new "File::PathList".

    It takes the following options as key/value pairs.

    paths
        The compulsory "paths" param should be a reference to an "ARRAY" of
        local filesystem paths.

    cache
        If the optional "cache" param is set to true, the object will
        internally cache the results of the file lookups. (false by default)

    If the "new" contructor is provided only a single param, this will be
    take to mean "paths =" $param>.

    Returns a new "File::PathList" object, or "undef" if a valid path set
    was not provided.

  paths
    The "paths" accessor returns the list of paths use to create the
    "File::PathList" object.

    Returns a list of localised path strings.

  cache
    The "cache" accessor indicates whether or not the "File::PathList"
    object is caching the results of the file lookups.

  find_file $unix_path
    The "find_file" method takes a unix-style relative file path, and
    iterates through the list of paths, checking for the file in it.

    Returns the full path to the file, the false null string '' if the file
    could not be found, or "undef" if passed a bad file name.
