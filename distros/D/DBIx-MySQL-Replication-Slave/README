NAME
    DBIx::MySQL::Replication::Slave - Stop, start and monitor your slaves.

VERSION
    version 0.02

SYNOPSIS
    This module gives you an OO interface for stopping, starting and
    monitoring the status and health of your MySQL slaves. It doesn't do
    anything you can't already do for yourself, but it makes some basic
    tasks just a little bit easier.

        use DBIx::MySQL::Replication::Slave;

        my $slave = DBIx::MySQL::Replication::Slave->new( dbh => $dbh );

        if ( $slave->is_stopped ) {
    
            $slave->start;
    
            if ( $slave->is_running ) {
                print "slave now running\n";
            }
            else {
                print "cannot start stopped slave.\n";
            }
    
        }

    If you need a quick monitor script:

        $slave->max_seconds_behind_master( 30 );

        if ( !$slave->slave_ok ) {
            # send an alert to the administrator...
        }

    For some quick debugging:

        use Data::Dump qw( dump );
        print dump( $slave->status );

        print "seconds behind: " . $slave->status->{seconds_behind_master};

CONSTRUCTOR AND STARTUP
  new( dbh => $dbh )
    Creates and returns a new DBIx::MySQL::Replication::Slave object.

        my $slave = DBIx::MySQL::Replication::Slave->new( dbh => $dbh );

    *   "dbh => $dbh"

        A valid database handle to your slave server is required. You'll
        need to pass it to the constructor:

            my $slave = DBIx::MySQL::Replication::Slave->new( dbh => $dbh );

        Generally, the user will need to have the following MySQL
        privileges:

        SUPER,REPLICATION CLIENT

    *   "lc => 0|1"

        By default, the status variables returned by MySQL are converted to
        lower case. This is for readability. You may turn this off if you
        wish, by explicitly turning it off when you create the object:

            my $slave = DBIx::MySQL::Replication::Slave->new( dbh => $dbh, lc => 0 );

    *   "max_seconds_behind_master => $seconds"

        By default this is set to a very generous number (86400 seconds).
        Set this value if you'd like to take a shorter amount of time into
        account when checking on your health. This is strongly recommended:

            # Anything longer than 30 seconds is not acceptable
            my $slave = DBIx::MySQL::Replication::Slave->new(
                dbh => $dbh,
                seconds_behind_master => 30
            );

        If you think it's cleaner, you can also set this value *after*
        object creation.

            $slave->max_seconds_behind_master(30);

SUBROUTINES/METHODS
  status
    Returns a HASHREF of the MySQL slave status variables. These vars will,
    by default, be converted to lower case, unless you have turned this off
    when you construct the object. See the lc option to new() for more info.

  refresh_status
    Issues a fresh "SLOW SLAVE STATUS" query and returns the new results of
    $slave->status to you.

  start
    Issues a "START SLAVE" query and returns DBI's raw return value directly
    to you.

  stop
    Issues a "STOP SLAVE" query and returns DBI's raw return value directly
    to you.

  slave_ok
    This method returns true if slave_io_running and slave_sql_running are
    both equal to 'Yes' AND if seconds_behind_master is <=
    max_seconds_behind master.

  is_running
    Returns true if both slave_io_running and slave_sql_running are set to
    'Yes'

  is_stopped
    Returns true if both slave_io_running and slave_sql_running are set to
    'No'. If only one of these values returns 'Yes', it's probably fair to
    say that the slave is in some transitional state. Neither stopped nor
    running may be an accurate description in this case.

BUGS AND LIMITATIONS
    Please report any bugs or feature requests to
    "bug-dbix-mysql-replication-slave at rt.cpan.org", or through the web
    interface at
    <http://rt.cpan.org/NoAuth/ReportBug.html?Queue=DBIx-MySQL-Replication-S
    lave>. I will be notified, and then you'll automatically be notified of
    progress on your bug as I make changes.

TESTING
    Have a look at the source of t/connect.t if you'd like to do more
    extensive testing of your install. This will require that you already
    have a fully functional slave set up in order for the tests to pass.
    These tests are skipped by default, but you are encouraged to run them
    as part of your install process.
