        + Upd : The internal XS helpers headers were updated to help uncover
                some possible future memory-related errors.

0.11    2015-11-05 01:00 UTC - Vincent Pit
        + Add : It is now possible to specify a re::engine::Plugin object
                destructor by passing the 'free' option either to
                re::engine::Plugin->import or to $re->callbacks.
        + Chg : A large chunk of boilerplate XS code, which is also used in
                other XS modules, has been factored out of the main .xs file
                to a collection of .h files in the xsh subdirectory.
        + Fix : A couple of memory leaks have been plugged.

0.10    2014-10-01 23:55 UTC - Vincent Pit
        + Fix : [RT #92118] : Testing failed with Perl 5.17.5+
                The tests have been taught about perls newer than 5.18.0.
                Thanks Tokuhiro Matsuno for reporting.
        + Fix : The module should no longer cause segfaults when an END block
                executed at the end of a pseudo-fork compiles some code with
                eval STRING.
        + Fix : Miscellaneous compiler warnings with newer perls have been
                silenced.
        + Tst : Author tests are no longer bundled with this distribution.
                They are only made available to authors in the git repository.
        + Upd : Package metadata overhaul.

0.09    2011-04-05 16:05 UTC - Vincent Pit
        + Add : The constants REP_THREADSAFE and REP_FORKSAFE tell you whenever
                the pragma is thread-safe and fork-safe.
        + Fix : Compatibility with perl 5.13.6 and upwards.
        + Fix : The pragma should be much less eager to leak into other scopes.
        + Fix : Memory leaks of code references stored into the regexp object.
        + Fix : Work around Kwalitee test misfailures.
        + Tst : Thread safety is now tested on perl 5.13.4 and greater.

0.08    2009-08-29 16:55 UTC - Vincent Pit
        + Add : The new ->callbacks method to the regexp object let you specify
                the 'exec' callback on an individual basis.
        + Chg : Perl 5.10 is now required (instead of 5.9.5).
        + Fix : The pragma was leaking into required scopes on 5.10.0.
        + Fix : If you specified a different re::engine::Plugin between the
                compilation and the execution of a regular expression, the
                'exec' callback invoked used to be the one for the second
                engine. Worse, if the original engine wasn't in scope at the
                time of execution, nothing happened. This is now fixed.
        + Fix : The reference count of the callbacks stored wasn't properly
                decremented.
        + Fix : Incomplete MANIFEST.
        + Tst : Subdirectories are now ordered.
        + Tst : Author tests.

0.07    2009-08-23 09:30 UTC - Vincent Pit
        + Fix : [perl #38684]: test failures in t/method/mod.t
        + Fix : Building with blead.
