 - New BoundingBox class, which represents outline's bounding box for a
   face (Ivan Baidakou, basiliscos).
 - New NamedInfo class, which allows to access to information from 'names
   table' in font file, e.g. get font copyrigh information (Ivan Baidakou,
   basiliscos).
 - New CharMap class, which allows to access to character map from font
   typefaces (Ivan Baidakou, basiliscos).
 - Improve module building, i.e. use Devel::CheckLib instead of pkg-config
   invocation (Ivan Baidakou, basiliscos).
 - Skip pgm-comparison tests as they are dependend on underlying FT2

 - Now compiles with older versions of FreeType, at least back to 2.0.9.
   There are macro #if directives to conditionalize the code on the
   version, based on the FreeType changelogs and grepping of various
   versions of the source, so it should work with lots of different
   versions now. The POD documents the features that aren't available in
   older versions.
 - Various changes to make it compile under Perl 5.6.1.
 - When loading a bitmapped font, set the pixel size to the first fixed
   size, which should usually be the right thing.  Seems to be necessary on
   older versions of FreeType (at least 2.0.9) which don't do this
   automatically.
 - Added a few more tests for extracting bitmaps (including from a Windows
   FNT format file added to the distribution), and made tests that use the
   BDF font skip if the version of FreeType is too old to support BDF
   fonts.
 - Don't export the FT_LOAD_RENDER or FT_LOAD_MONOCHROME symbols, because
   they aren't needed.	The bitmaps are always rendered when you ask for
   the bitmap image, and you can pass FT_RENDER_MODE_MONO to bitmap() to
   avoid antialiasing.

0.02 2004-09-10 qef@laxan.com
 - The methods that return bitmap images have been changed to also return
   the left and top offsets of the bitmap from the origin of the glyph, so
   that the images can be properly positioned within a larger picture.
 - Added the svg_path() method and an example for generating an SVG image
   showing a single glyph.
 - Better checking in $ft->version().
 - Make sure that glyph outlines can be accessed even if the first thing
   done to a glyph is to get its bitmap.  Added tests for doing this both
   ways round.	The solution could be better though.
 - Added methods $face->ascender() and $face->descender().
 - Added method $glyph->bitmap_magick() and an example program
   demonstrating its use, as well as using ImageMagick drawing functions to
   render outlines.
 - Added test for POD correctness.
 - Provided a better META.yml file.
 - Minor change to typemap for older Perls.
