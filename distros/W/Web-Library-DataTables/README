NAME
    Web::Library::DataTables - Distribution wrapper around DataTables

SYNOPSIS
        my $library_manager = Web::Library->instance;
        $library_manager->mount_library({ name => 'DataTables' });

DESCRIPTION
    This is a distribution wrapper around the jQuery plugin DataTables. It
    enables you to include the client-side library in multiple Web
    application projects with very little effort. See Web::Library for the
    general concept and how to use it with Catalyst.

    DataTables is a jQuery plugin and as such requires jQuery. However, this
    distribution does not define a dependency on Web::Library::jQuery
    because you might want to load jQuery in some other way, and in any case
    it can't make an assumption about which version of jQuery you want to
    use. Therefore, you might want to use it this way:

        my $library_manager = Web::Library->instance;
        $library_manager->mount_library({ name => 'jQuery' });
        $library_manager->mount_library({ name => 'DataTables' });

LIBRARY VERSIONS
    The following versions are available. For each version all included
    files are listed. Files marked with an asterisk are included in that
    versions' asset list - see Web::Library's "css_link_tags_for()" and
    "script_tags_for()" methods for an explanation of the concept.

    Version 1.9.4 (the default)
            * css/datatables.css
              images/back_disabled.png
              images/back_enabled.png
              images/back_enabled_hover.png
              images/forward_disabled.png
              images/forward_enabled.png
              images/forward_enabled_hover.png
              images/sort_asc.png
              images/sort_asc_disabled.png
              images/sort_both.png
              images/sort_desc.png
              images/sort_desc_disabled.png
              js/DT_bootstrap.js
            * js/jquery.dataTables.min.js

        The file "js/DT_bootstrap.js" makes DataTables work with Twitter
        Bootstrap, but is not included in the JavaScript assets list because
        if you don't use Bootstrap, you don't need this file. Therefore you
        have to load it manually like this:

            <body>
                ...
                [% web_library.script_tags_for('Bootstrap', 'jQuery', 'DataTables') %]
                <script src="/js/DT_bootstrap.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
            </body>
