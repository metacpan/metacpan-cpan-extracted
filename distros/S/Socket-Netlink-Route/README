NAME
    `Socket::Netlink::Route' - interface to Linux's `NETLINK_ROUTE' netlink
    socket protocol

DESCRIPTION
    This module contains the low-level constants and structure handling
    functions required to use the `NETLINK_ROUTE' protocol of Linux's
    `PF_NETLINK' socket family. It is suggested to use the high-level object
    interface to this protocol instead; see IO::Socket::Netlink::Route.

    For more information, see the Linux kernel documentation about the
    `NETLINK_ROUTE' protocol family in rtnetlink(7)

     $ man 7 rtnetlink
