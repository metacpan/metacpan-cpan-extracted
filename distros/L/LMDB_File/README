LMDB_File version 0.13
======================

LMDB_File is a Perl wrapper around the OpenLDAP's LMDB (Lightning
Memory-Mapped Database) C library.

LMDB is an ultra-fast, ultra-compact key-value data store developed
by Symas for the OpenLDAP Project. See http://symas.com/mdb/ for details.

LMDB_File provides full access to the complete C API, a thin Perl wrapper
with an Object-Oriented interface and a simple Perl's tie interface
compatible with others DBMs.

PREREQUISITES

Right now LMDB needs a 64bits platform.

 Before you can build LMDB_File you need to have the following installed
on your system:

    * Perl 5.10.0 up to 5.38 linked with pthreads.
      See https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=122906

    * A working C compiler.

    * LMDB Version 0.9.17 or greater
      (previous versions may work but will miss some features)

      Some Linux distributions are now including it:

        * Fedora 20+

            `yum install lmdb-devel`

        * Ubuntu

            `apt-get install liblmdb-dev`

      If the library and its header file isn't found installed in
      your system, Makefile.PL will try to use Doug Hoyte's Alien::LMDB module
      if available.

      Otherwise, if you getting this from GitHub, a submodule is included
      in 'liblmdb' that you can use, please check git documentation to
      populate the directory.

    * To run the test harness for this module:
      - You must make sure that the directory where you have untarred this
      module is NOT a network drive, e.g. NFS or AFS.
      - You need the Test::Exception module installed.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

*** WARNING ***
This is an early release to allow the interested people the testing and
discussion of the module: there is some missing features and you should
be aware that the API isn't in stone yet. See TODO
