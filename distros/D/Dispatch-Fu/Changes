0.97 Sat Sep 16 20:05:09 2023
     - added "cases" keyword that can be used inside of
       the "dispatch" BLOCK to get a list of cases added
       by the C<on> keyword. When used outside of the a
       "dispatch" block, it returns undef.
     - "cases" introspection allows for much more idiomatic
       recipes inside of the "dispatch" BLOCK.

0.98 Sat Sep 27 20:05:09 2023
     - added xdefault handling the situation where
       the case name is the same as the string value,
       which is the simlest case possible and what people
       use straight HASH ref dispatching for; see the
       tests and POD examples

0.99 Sat Sep 30 20:05:09 2023
     - fixed xdefault to allow for the first parameter to
       to be C<undef>
