	* lib/CGI/Screen.pm: Replaced the 'screen_' prefix used to
	indicate the CGI variable carrying function name to
	'screen_function'. The old prefix caused spurious warnings as
	spotted by Julian Morrison.

	* t/import.t, t/method.t: tests will work with some older CGI.pm

	* lib/CGI/Screen.pm (_set_screen): Added dont_cut_loops flag.

 	tests to make cpan-testers happy ;-)

	* lib/CGI/Screen.pm (_set_screen): Jumps to the same screen are
 	not added to the history any more.
	(url_to_screen): Does not care about passed parameters any
 	more. Bad braino :-(

Sun Jun 28 09:39:19 1998  Ulrich Pfeifer  <pfeifer@wait.de>

	* lib/CGI/Screen.pm (AUTOLOAD): Now actually generates the code.
  	Should speed up calls for freqently used methods like
 	->TD. Especially when used with mod_perl.
	(url_to_screen, link-to_screen): Now take additional parameters to
 	encode in the url.
	(_set_screen): Now saves up to seven back screens to support
 	sensible backing out a dead ends.
	(_set_screen): Now prefers *_data methods.
	(import): Experimental support for importing CGI.pm stuff

Tue Dec 30 09:49:58 1997  Ulrich Pfeifer  <pfeifer@wait.de>

 	suggested by Andreas Koenig.

Mon Dec 29 10:26:42 1997  Ulrich Pfeifer  <pfeifer@wait.de>

	* Makefile.PL: Added new VERSION algorithm and 'README' preop.

	* MANIFEST: Removed test.pl, added README.

	* lib/CGI/Screen.pm: Added copyright notice and documentation for
 	data screens

	* CGI-Screen.prj : moved 'screen' to 'eg' subdirectory
