2005-07-18   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

	* Release 2.03.

	* Updated HTML::FormTemplate (now v2.03 up from v2.021) to fix a bug in the
	make_html_input_echo() method where the user input was not being
	HTML-escaped like in make_html_input_form(), allowing for users to leave
	deceptive messages, hyperlinks, or script attacks.  After the change, the
	raw input is always displayed, so viewers see exactly what was entered. 
	Note that this module was always intended to treat input as plain text, and
	users should never be entering HTML and expect it to be treated as such on
	display.  No other functional changes.

	* Note that this fix was actually done on 2004-09-26, but actually releasing 
	the fix on CPAN was neglected until 2005-07-18.

	* Updated copyright statement range to 2004, when the fix was made.

	* Updated external dependency on CGI::MultiValuedHash to v1.09 from v1.081 
	(not required to fix the bug, but a good idea none-the-less).

2003-03-16   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

	* Release 2.021.

	* This is a small maintenance release that is mainly for improving
	documentation.  Similar maintenance releases are being done with all of my
	distributions simultaneously.  A lot of it was formatting issues that were
	easy to miss before; the other bullet points below list the non-formatting
	issues.  These files had formatting fixes: FormTemplate.pm, ChangeLog.

	* The distribution file layouts have also been standardized, with modules
	going in a "lib" folder and tests going in a "t" folder.  "test.pl" was
	changed to "t/HTML-FormTemplate.t" and "FormTemplate.pm" was changed
	to "lib/HTML/FormTemplate.pm".

	* Updated all Copyright statements to a better (and longer) version, which
	is dated 1999-2003.  Your rights to use these modules haven't changed, but
	they may now be easier to understand.  These statements appear once in the
	ReadMe file at the bottom (under "AUTHOR"), and twice in each module (.pm
	file), a full version at the bottom (under "AUTHOR") and a shorter version
	at the top (in code comments).

	* Added the "use warnings" pragma at the top of all files beside "use
	strict"; every occurance of "use strict" gained a "use warnings" whether it
	was in the module proper or in its test script or in its SYNOPSIS.  This
	should save users from having to put -w on the command line for them.

	* Incremented the module $VERSION number by 0.001, and all test scripts to
	require the new version.  Also, where any of my modules use others of my
	modules, they now require the latest version as of this writing, for
	simplicity of maintenance.

	* Updated all test scripts to read $verbose from @ARGV (command line
	arguments), and other test script improvements.

	* Updated these sections of the ReadMe file: INSTALLATION.

2001-09-03   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

	* Release 2.02.

	* This release is primarily for making the html that this class outputs more 
	like W3C's new XHTML standard, and give it better support for stylesheets.  
	The public interface for this module has not changed, so you can continue 
	using it as you did before.  You are recommended to use HTML::EasyTags 1.06 
	or later with this, though version 1.03 will still work.

	* Any code changes are mostly cosmetic.  When generating forms or reports 
	within tables, this class now generates the table/tr/td html tags without 
	any attributes; they used align/valign/cellspacing/cellpadding before.  
	It is recommended that you use a stylesheet to align cell contents the way 
	that you want, for example: 'TD {text-align: left; vertical-align: top}'.

	* All occurances of the "font" tag and their effects have been removed.  
	What this means is that form elements which were colored before, such as 
	each of the required/error/private flags and the error text, are now not 
	coloured.  However, since all of these are still identifiable by their 
	character composition, this shouldn't be a serious problem.

	* The SYNOPSIS documentation has been updated such that it's corresponding 
	sample output has three examples: html for initial run and when Submit is 
	clicked, plus what the generated email looks like.

	* A BUGS section has been added to the documentation near the top that 
	mentions remaining compatability issues with the XHTML or HTML standards.  
	However, this module's output should continue to work with web browsers.

2001-06-04   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

	* Release 2.01.

	* Fixed bug related to organizing field groups into tables.  Previously the 
	field definition attributes [table_rows/rows, table_cols/cols, table_acrf] 
	were not fetched properly, causing strange effects like having a single 
	table column when two were requested.  The table feature now works properly.

	* Removed a small design flaw where the "type" attribute of field definitions 
	had needed to be a certain typecase in order to be recognized, due to some 
	chicken-and-egg scenario where normal definition parsing could only be done 
	once we knew what field type to parse it as, but to know the type you had to 
	parse.  The new version removes that restriction so now you can mix the 
	typecase of "type" as much as any other attribute as is your wish.

	* Small update to the make_table_from_list() method where the HTML code for 
	each table cell now appears on its own line for greater readability.

	* The module POD was updated, mostly in Name, Synopsis, Properties.

2001-04-03   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

	* Release 2.0.

	* This release marks the largest update of this module since it was first 
	released on CPAN; at least half of the code and documentation was re-written.
	Many things were added and a few things were removed; those that were not 
	removed should be backwards-compatible with release 1.05.  

	* HTML::FormTemplate is no longer subclassed from HTML::EasyTags, which 
	means you can no longer call the latter's methods from an object of the 
	former.  Prime examples of these are the autoloaded methods named after HTML 
	tags.  Also no longer available are: groups_by_default(), prologue_tag(), 
	comment_tag(), make_html_tag(), make_html_tag_group(), start_html(), 
	end_html().  If you want to use any of those then you need to instantiate 
	an HTML::EasyTags object yourself to call them from.  HTML::FormTemplate 
	does still *use* the other class internally of course.  This change was made 
	largely to address a glaring usability issue that is inherent with 
	autoloading.  That is, a user could mis-spell a method name and they would 
	not get an appropriate run-time error because an autoloaded HTML-making 
	method got called instead.

	* Autoloading was completely removed and now there is an explicit method for 
	each one of the form field types; the method has the same name as the type.
	However, these are shims, and the real work is still done elsewhere.

	* The lower-level methods that do the actual making of form field HTML saw 
	the most changes and were completely rewritten.  As part of the rewrite, 
	functionality that was crammed into 3 methods is now handled by 9 which are 
	more specialized.

	* All ten single field types now have group counterparts.  Although the 
	usefulness of some of these may vary, you at least now have the choice.
	Added are: reset_group, submit_group, popup_menu_group, scrolling_list_group.
	The latter two cases differ from their single-field equivalents by 
	distributing any default values so that each group member gets one rather 
	than one field getting all.  The most useful is probably popup_menu_group.

	* All field definition attributes are now the same between corresponding 
	single and group fields, except for group-only ones, so you can use the 
	singular or plural names for definition attributes interchangeably.

	* The POD documentation was greatly improved.  It is now more informative, 
	better organized, and it's easier to understand what's going on.  The 
	methods are now arranged in a different order, with logically related ones 
	appearing together.  Each field-type method now has a full description, 
	including what positional and named parameters work with it (each is 
	backwards-compatible with CGI.pm's methods of the same names).  Each 
	definition parameter has its own description and they are all grouped by 
	related usage.  Release 1.05 had incomplete information in the above 
	regards and it was organized haphazardly.

	* These methods are no longer available: make_input_tag(), 
	make_input_tag_group(), make_attribute_definition().  The first two 
	were among those completely rewritten and the new versions are private.  
	The third one was too proprietary and should be handled by calling code 
	instead.

	* Several values that were hardwired constants in the previous release are 
	now variable and can be changed with appropriate new or updated methods: 
	new_form_determinant(), default_field_type(), default_field_name(), 
	bad_input_marker(), required_field_marker(), private_field_marker().  The 
	hardwired constants of old are now default values for object properties.

	* Another new methods include field_html_from_defin(), which acts sort of 
	like the field_html() method in that it returns rendered HTML for single
	fields, except with the new one you provide a definition as an argument 
	instead of giving the name of a stored definition.

	* Also new is the utility method make_table_from_list() which will take a 
	list of elements and arrange them into an HTML table of the dimensions you 
	specify (either N columns or N rows), either down first or across first.

	* These form field attributes are new: tag_attr, min_grp_count, table_cols, 
	table_rows, table_acrf, req_min_count, req_max_count, req_opt_match, 
	str_above_input, str_below_input.  The first five are used when making field 
	HTML (all but the first one being for groups only), the next three are used 
	with input validation, and the last two are used when making whole forms.

	* New field attributes allow field groups to be arranged into tables instead 
	of merely being linebreak-delimited.

	* New field attributes allow you to validate user input based on the number 
	of group elements that were filled in (eg: must choose three options).  Also 
	there is validation that user input from selection fields matches the 
	available options, so you know if they manually changed values.

	* New field attributes place literal HTML above and below rendered fields 
	so you can do things like applying <DIV> formats.

	* The handling of form field definition parameters is now greatly improved 
	so now they are much more flexible to your needs regardless of whether you 
	feed them to the class using field-type methods or field_definitions().
	In general you can name your parameters anything that Class::ParamParser 
	can interpret.  But the TYPE parameter is an exception; see its POD.

	* Data::MultiValuedHash objects are always used internally to store 
	definitions for fields, which means you can use either scalars or array 
	refs however you like for definition parameter values without choking 
	the class.  User-input is stored in CGI::MultiValuedHash objects, which 
	are subclassed from the first type in case you want to provide a raw
	query string to user_input().  The two types of MVH objects are 
	interchangeable as far as you providing them as a method arguments.

	* Due to the different way that field definition parameters are handled 
	internally, you can now add new ones easily without having to change the 
	code that doesn't use them.

	* Numerous old bugs were fixed and it is quite possible that new ones 
	have come up.  However, the new code is also a *lot* easier to understand 
	than the old code, so it is easier to fix and add new features.

	* Note that "test.pl" is incomplete; it only tests that this module will 
	compile but not that the methods work; it is included so that people can use 
	the Makefile in the standard way during installation.  This file will be 
	fleshed out when I have the chance.

	* The module is now 106K including POD, up from the 76K it was before.

2001-03-18   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

	* Release 1.05.

	* This release is the first one that includes the CPAN standard files 
	"Makefile.PL", "test.pl", and "MANIFEST", which were all created following 
	the previous release.  The content of "Manifest" was previously inside the 
	"ReadMe" file.  Improved the install instructions in my ReadMe file.

	* Note that "test.pl" is incomplete; it only tests that this module will 
	compile but not that the methods work; it is included so that people can use 
	the Makefile in the standard way during installation.  "test.pl" will be 
	fleshed out during major release 2.0 of this module, coming soon.

	* This class now requires Class::ParamParser 1.03, HTML::EasyTags 1.0301, 
	Data::MultiValuedHash 1.06, and CGI::MultiValuedHash 1.06.  I consider the 
	first three modules to be stable and well tested, as well as unlikely to 
	change.  The fourth module is partially tested, but production use of the 
	other functionality finds it to be working properly.

2001-02-16   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

	* Release 1.04.

	* This release is entirely to maintain compatability with HTML::EasyTags 
	1.03, which is a parent class.  Specifically, one of the class properties 
	and its associated accessor method, positional_by_default(), was removed from
	HTML::EasyTags because it was no longer needed there.  However, since some 
	methods of HTML::FormTemplate do use this property, it and the associated 
	method has been added to HTML::FormTemplate itself.

	* This class now requires versions 1.03 each of Class::ParamParser and 
	HTML::EasyTags, so you will need to have them installed.  Note that I 
	consider those two releases to be complete and stable, so they are unlikely 
	to be changed in the forseeable future.

2001-01-30   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

	* Release 1.03.

	* This release is entirely for fixing bugs in the coding and the POD.

	* Fixed bug where providing a Hash ref as a "labels" parameter for 
	radio/field groups doesn't work (acts like explicit labels not provided and 
	uses values as labels).  Fixed a similar bug that afflicted the "defaults"
	parameter.  This is the last of the "bugs" that I know of.

	* Fixed bugs in POD that caused display problems with it, including:
		- Description section too long; now split into itself and Overview.
		- Ensured a blank line between Synopsis and Description.
		- Likewise between "HTML Code..." and "Field Types...".
		- Changed several bulleted lists whose first word of text was boldfaced 
		into numbered lists; before, some strangeness caused all the text of the 
		bulleted lists to be boldfaced and in one paragraph and/or strangely 
		indented in CPAN's HTML version; these should be fixed.

	* Thanks to Geir Johannessen <geir.johannessen@nextra.com> for alerting me to 
	several obscure bugs in my POD (the first three); these only showed up when 
	manifying, whereas MacPerl's Shuck and CPAN's HTMLizer rendered it properly.

2001-01-05   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

	* Release 1.02.

	* This release is the first one following official registrations with 
	"The Perl 5 Module List".  The updated entry would look like this:

HTML::
::FormTemplate    adpO Store definition, make persist forms, report DUNCAND

	* This release contains my "HTML::FormTemplate" module, which was previously 
	a part of the following distributions under the temporary name of 
	"HTML::FormMaker": 
		- "libdwg": v1.0 r2000-07-23, v1.11 r2000-08-23
		- "CGI-FormGenerator": v0.9 r2000-09-04, v0.9201 r2000-12-26

	* This module requires Perl version 5.004.
	It also requires HTML::EasyTags 1.02, and CGI::MultiValuedHash 1.03.

	* Code changes since HTML::FormMaker consist mainly in accounting for 
	changes to the other modules that this one uses.  Its public interface is 
	mostly unchanged.  What did change is that user input and field definitions 
	can now be passed in any format that CGI::MultiValuedHash can understand as 
	an initializer.  Also, the inherited start_html() and end_html() methods no 
	longer exist as they were gratuitious.

	* The POD also received significant updates, particlularly in the Synopsis 
	and "Parameters by Field Type" sections.

2000-12-26   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

	* CGI-FormGenerator 0.9201, the last version of any distribution to include
HTML::FormMaker, was released.

2000-07-23   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

	* libdwg 1.0, the first version of any distribution to include
HTML::FormMaker, was released on CPAN.

2000-04-21   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

	* Completed primary development on this module.

2000-01-30   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

	* Began development on the final version of this module.

	* Module based on a template created by h2xs 1.18.

1999-07 thru 1999-12

	* Worked on second prototype of code that ended up in this module.

1999-02 thru 1999-05

	* Created first prototypes of code that ended up in this module, which were 
	used in a production environment as part of modules dedicated to doing 
	either e-mail forms or guest books or threaded discussion boards.
