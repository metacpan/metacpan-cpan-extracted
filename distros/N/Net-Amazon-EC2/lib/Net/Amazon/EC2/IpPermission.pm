Net::Amazon::EC2::IpPermission

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A class representing a rule within the security group.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=over

=item ip_protocol (required)

Protocol for the rule. e.g. tcp

=item from_port (required)

Start of port range for the TCP and UDP protocols, or an 
ICMP type number. An ICMP type number of -1 indicates a 
wildcard (i.e., any ICMP type number). 

=item to_port (required)

End of port range for the TCP and UDP protocols, or an 
ICMP code. An ICMP code of -1 indicates a wildcard (i.e., 
any ICMP code). 

=item ip_ranges (optional)

An array ref of Net::Amazon::EC2::IpRange objects to be associated with this rule.

=item groups (optional)

An array ref of Net::Amazon::EC2::UserIdGroupPair objects to be associated with this rule.

=item icmp_port (optional)

For the ICMP protocol, the ICMP type and code must be specified. This must be specified in the format type:code where both are integers. Type, code, 
or both can be specified as -1, which is a wildcard.
