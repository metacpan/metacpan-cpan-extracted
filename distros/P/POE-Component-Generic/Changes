    - Added 01_pod and 02_pod_coverage

0.1200 Wed Mar 11 2009
    - Better handling of shutdown, delete wheel on CHLD.  Now the session

0.1100 Wed Jan 23 2008
    - Did away with mapping PBids to session/event tupples.  This allows
        us to completely ignore postback GC issues, at the cost of slightly
        modifying postback semantics.  Win!
        Closes RT 32067, thank you Paul Driver.
