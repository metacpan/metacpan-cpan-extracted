NOTE: This example directory is in the process of being refactored
to use GLUT/FreeGLUT rather than the original GLX/X11 for window
creation and user interactions.  It has not yet been determined the
level of compatibility to be maintained between the previous GLX-only
implementation and the new cross platform one based on *GLUT.

These are Stan's original examples. Not all will work with all X/OpenGL depths.

Additionally, there is a planets demo (based on an article in EPM/2) by
Ilya Zakharevich.  The articles explains how to build the demo step by step.
Different steps are available via the supplied RCS file.
