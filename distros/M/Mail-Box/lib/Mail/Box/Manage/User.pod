=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Mail::Box::Manage::User;
 use User::Identity;

 my $id      = User::Identity->new(...);
 my $user    = Mail::Box::Manage::User->new
   ( identity  => $id

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Where the L<Mail::Box::Manager|Mail::Box::Manager> takes care of some set of open folder,
this extension will add knowledge about some related person.  At the
same time, it will try to cache some information about that person's
folder files.

you use.

=item autodetect => TYPE|ARRAY-OF-TYPES

=item collection_type => CLASS

Subfolders grouped together.

=item default_folder_type => NAME|CLASS

=item delimiter => STRING

The separator used in folder names.  This doesn't need to be the
same as your directory system is using.

=item folderdir => DIRECTORY

=item identity => OBJECT

The main difference between the L<Mail::Box::Manager|Mail::Box::Manager> and this class, is
the concept of some person (or virtual person) who's files are being
administered by this object.  The OBJECT is an L<User::Identity|User::Identity>.

The smallest identity that will do:
C<< my $id = User::Identity->new('myname') >>

=item inbox => NAME

The name of the user's inbox.

Returns a L<User::Identity|User::Identity> object.

=item $obj-E<gt>B<inbox>( [$name] )

(Set and) get the $name of the mailbox which is considered the folder
for incoming mail.  In many protocols, this folder is handled separately.
For instance in IMAP this is the only case-insensitive folder name.

=item $obj-E<gt>B<create>($name, %options)

Creates a new folder with the specified name.  An folder's administrative
structure (L<Mail::Box::Identity|Mail::Box::Identity>) is returned, but the folder is not
opened.

In the accidental case that the folder already
exists, a warning will be issued, and an empty list/undef returned.

The %options are passed to L<Mail::Box::create()|Mail::Box/"Internals"> of your default folder
type, except for the options intended for this method itself.

 -Option       --Default
  create_real    <true>
  create_supers  <false>
  deleted        <false>
  id_options     []

=over 2

=item create_real => BOOLEAN

When this option is false, the pysical folder will not be created, but
only the administration is updated.

=item create_supers => BOOLEAN

When you create a folder where upper hierarchy level are missing, they
will be created as well.

=item deleted => BOOLEAN

The folder starts as deleted.

=item id_options => ARRAY

Values passed to the instantiated L<Mail::Box::Identity|Mail::Box::Identity>.  That object
is very picky about the initiation values it accepts.

=back

=item $obj-E<gt>B<delete>($name)

Remove all signs from the folder on the file-system.  Messages still in
the folder will be removed.  This method returns a true value when the
folder has been removed or not found, so "false" means failure.

It is also possible to delete a folder using C<< $folder->delete >>,
which will call this method here.  OPTIONS, which are used for some
other folder types, will be ignored here: the user's index contains the
required details.

 -Option   --Defined in        --Default
  recursive  Mail::Box::Manager  <folder's default>

=over 2

=item recursive => BOOLEAN

=back

example: how to delete a folder

 print "no xyz (anymore)\n" if $user->delete('xyz');

=item $obj-E<gt>B<folder>($name)

Returns the folder description, a L<Mail::Box::Identity|Mail::Box::Identity>.

=item $obj-E<gt>B<folderCollection>($name)

Returns a pair: the folder collection (L<Mail::Box::Collection|Mail::Box::Collection>) and
the base name of $name.

=item $obj-E<gt>B<rename>($oldname, $newname, %options)

Rename the folder with name $oldname to $newname.  Both names are full
pathnames.

 -Option       --Default
  create_supers  <false>

=over 2

=item create_supers => BOOLEAN

When you rename a folder to a place where upper hierarchy levels are
missing, they will get be defined, but with the deleted flag set.

=back

=item $obj-E<gt>B<topfolder>()

Returns the top folder of the user's mailbox storage.

=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

=over 4

=item Error: Cannot create $name: higher levels missing

Unless you set L<create(create_supers)|Mail::Box::Manage::User/"Manage folders">, all higher level folders must
exist before this new one can be created.

=item Error: Cannot rename $name to $new: higher levels missing

Unless you set L<create(create_supers)|Mail::Box::Manage::User/"Manage folders">, all higher level folders must
exist before this new one can be created.

=item Error: Folder $name is already open.

You cannot ask the manager for a folder which is already open. In some
older releases (before MailBox 2.049), this was permitted, but then
behaviour changed, because many nasty side-effects are to be expected.
For instance, an L<Mail::Box::update()|Mail::Box/"The folder"> on one folder handle would
influence the second, probably unexpectedly.

=item Error: Folder $name is not a Mail::Box; cannot add a message.

The folder where the message should be appended to is an object which is
not a folder type which extends L<Mail::Box|Mail::Box>.  Probably, it is not a folder
at all.

=item Warning: Folder does not exist, failed opening $type folder $name.

The folder does not exist and creating is not permitted (see
L<open(create)|Mail::Box::Manager/"Manage open folders">) or did not succeed.  When you do not have sufficient
access rights to the folder (for instance wrong password for POP3),
this warning will be produced as well.

The manager tried to open a folder of the specified type.  It may help
to explicitly state the type of your folder with the C<type> option.
There will probably be another warning or error message which is related
to this report and provides more details about its cause.  You may also
have a look at L<new(autodetect)|Mail::Box::Manager/"METHODS"> and L<new(folder_types)|Mail::Box::Manager/"METHODS">.

=item Warning: Folder type $type is unknown, using autodetect.

The specified folder type (see L<open(type)|Mail::Box::Manager/"Manage open folders">, possibly derived from
the folder name when specified as url) is not known to the manager.
This may mean that you forgot to require the L<Mail::Box|Mail::Box> extension
which implements this folder type, but probably it is a typo.  Usually,
the manager is able to figure-out which type to use by itself.

=item Error: Illegal folder URL '$url'.

The folder name was specified as URL, but not according to the syntax.
See L<decodeFolderURL()|Mail::Box::Manager/"Internals"> for an description of the syntax.

=item Error: No foldername specified to open.

C<open()> needs a folder name as first argument (before the list of options),
or with the C<folder> option within the list.  If no name was found, the
MAIL environment variable is checked.  When even that does not result in
a usable folder, then this error is produced.  The error may be caused by
an accidental odd-length option list.

=item Error: Package $package does not implement $method.

Fatal error: the specific package (or one of its superclasses) does not
implement this method where it should. This message means that some other
related classes do implement this method however the class at hand does
not.  Probably you should investigate this and probably inform the author
of the package.

=item Error: Unable to remove folder $dir

=item Error: Use appendMessage() to add messages which are not in a folder.

You do not need to copy this message into the folder, because you do
not share the message between folders.

=item Warning: Use moveMessage() or copyMessage() to move between open folders.

The message is already part of a folder, and now it should be appended
to a different folder.  You need to decide between copy or move, which
both will clone the message (not the body, because they are immutable).

=item Warning: Will never create a folder $name without having write access.

You have set L<open(create)|Mail::Box::Manager/"Manage open folders">, but only want to read the folder.  Create is
only useful for folders which have write or append access modes
(see L<Mail::Box::new(access)|Mail::Box/"Constructors">).
