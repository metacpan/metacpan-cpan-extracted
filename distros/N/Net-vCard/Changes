Revision history for Perl extension Net::vCard

0.4 added vCard2label script
    a few more bug fixes

0.3 Functional bug fixes

0.2 UTF-16 support
     Apple's address book poops out UTF-16BE files from time to time.
     I have figured this all out and now it will correctly detect and load that kinda
     data too.

0.1 First prototype - put up on CPAN to solicit feedback
