0.14 2022-10-03 BOOK
    - give proper attribution to Tony Cook in the Changes file

0.11 2005-11-15 BOOK
    - moved all the documentation at the end of the module and script
    - added a Build.PL script
    - Enrico Sorcinelli (bepi) sent me a log file that
      Log::Procmail couldn't parse correctly. It does now.
    - mailstat.pl works like mailstat(1) when given an empty file

0.10 2005-03-28 BOOK
    - added META.yml and made t/01pod.t be seen by CPANTS

0.09 2005-01-19 BOOK
    - backport to perl 5.005 (Thanks to Mathieu Arnold)
    - can_read() does not work for files on Win32,
      so select() now returns undef on those systems

0.08 2004-04-26 BOOK
    - the fh() method returns a filehandle to the currently opened
      log file
    - the select() method returns a IO::Select object watching the
      current fh()
    - example script from Ian Langworth (thanks!)

0.07 2004-04-26 BOOK
    - support From addresses with spaces inside (darn spammers)
    - moved all files to lib/ and scripts, so as to avoid installing
      mailstat.pl in the same directory as Procmail.pm

    - fully use Test::More for the test suite
    - removed AUTOLOADed methods in Log::Procmail::Abstract
    - Return incomplete log lines when some fields are missing
      or lines are mixed up
    - ymd() returns undef when the date field is not good

0.03 2002-07-25 BOOK
