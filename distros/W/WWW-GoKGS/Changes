Revision history for Perl extension WWW::GoKGS.

0.21 Aug 21st, 2014

  [WWW::GoKGS::Scraper::TournList]

    - Add $tournament->{notes}, where $tournament denotes an element of
      $result->{tournaments}

  [WWW::GoKGS::Scraper::TournInfo]

    - Add $result->{notes}

0.20 Jul 14th, 2014

  - Add WWW::GoKGS::Scraper::TzList
  - Add WWW::GoKGS#cookie_jar

  [INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES]

    Remove time zone designators from times for games, i.e.,
    "2014-07-14T12:34Z" become "2014-07-14T12:34",
    since we don't know which time zone is used in KGS resources exactly.
    I mean, although KGS resources contains the abbreviated name of the time
    zone, such as "GMT" in the game arhchives, there are no standard rules
    to abbreviate the names. It's ambiguous. For example, "GMT" may be
    "Greenwich Mean Time" or "Ghana Mean Time".

    Fortunately, the time zone defaults to GMT (Greenwith Mean Time)
    unless we change our cookie settings by using KGS Time Zone Selector.
    If you want KGS resources to be stateless, do not use the selector.

0.15 Jun 29th, 2014

  [INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES]

    - Give up implementing incomplete filtering system.
      Instead, you can use nice modules on CPAN, such as JSON::Path
      which allows you to search complicated data structure.
      The following instance methods were removed:

        * WWW::GoKGS#date_filter
        * WWW::GoKGS#html_filter
        * WWW::GoKGS::Scraper#add_filter
        * WWW::GoKGS::Scraper#run_filter
        * WWW::GoKGS::Scraper::GameArchives#add_filter
        * WWW::GoKGS::Scraper::TournInfo#add_filter
        * WWW::GoKGS::Scraper::TournEntrants#add_filter
        * WWW::GoKGS::Scraper::TournGames#add_filter

    - Give up implementing imperfect class-building system.
      The following class methods were removed:

        * WWW::GoKGS#mk_accessors
        * WWW::GoKGS#make_accessor
        * WWW::GoKGS#accessor_name_for
        * WWW::GoKGS#builder_name_for
        * WWW::GoKGS#known_paths

      Besides, the following instance methods become read-only:

        * WWW::GoKGS#game_archives
        * WWW::GoKGS#top_100
        * WWW::GoKGS#tourn_list
        * WWW::GoKGS#tourn_info
        * WWW::GoKGS#tourn_entrants
        * WWW::GoKGS#tourn_games

      In addition, the following instance methods were removed:

        * WWW::GoKGS#set_scraper

    - Sorry for your inconvenience. I decided to commit the terrible changes
      listed above to make this distribution maintainable.

0.14 Jun 26th, 2014

  - Add the following instance methods:
      * can_scrape
      * each_scraper
  - Add the following class methods:
      * known_paths

  [INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES]

    - Scraper objects are not built lazily anymore,
      but are built when WWW::GoKGS object is created
    - Must pass a path included by known_paths() to mk_accessors()
    - #user_agent doesn't overwrite #user_agent attributes of
      all the scraper objects as a side effect anymore. You have to overwrite
      them explicitly by yourself.

0.13 Jun 24th, 2014

  - WWW::GoKGS#user_agent, #from, #date_filter and #html_filter
    become 'rw'
  - Add WWW::GoKGS#agent

0.12 Jun 23rd, 2014

  - WWW::GoKGS#user_agent defaults to LWP::RobotUA
    to avoid overloading the KGS server, while you can still set
    your own user agent.
  - Add #from which is used to construct LWP::RobotUA object.
    This attribute is required.
