NAME
        RT::Extension::TimeWorkedReport - summary of timespent on ticket for RT4

SUMMARY
    This RT extension enables reports on time worked on Tickets by User.

        https://rt.example.com/Tools/Reports/TimeWorkedReport.html

    This plugin is configured for RT4. For RT3.x see
    <http://requesttracker.wikia.com/wiki/TimeWorkedReport>.

DESCRIPTION
    This report allows the user to specify a datetime range and one or more
    queues, and displays the time worked for each ticket in the selected
    queue(s) which has > 0 minutes time worked in the datetime range. It
    will show non-superusers their own report and superusers a report of all
    users.

    It also will allow superusers to organize the report by ticket, with a
    breakdown of the contributions to that ticket per-person, rather than
    the default by-person organization.

INSTALL
        perl Makefile.PL
        make
        make install

        # Enable this plugin in your RT_SiteConfig.pm:
        Set(@Plugins, (qw/RT::Extension::TimeWorkedReport/) );

        After restarting RT the TimeWorkedReport will be available under the Tools menu.
