NAME

  DBD::PgPPSjis - Pure-Perl DBI driver for (not raw) ShiftJIS

SYNOPSIS

    use DBI;
    $dbh = DBI->connect('dbi:PgPPSjis:test',...);

DESCRIPTION

  This software was made from DBD::PgPP to support ShiftJIS scripting.

  DBD::PgPPSjis is a pure-Perl client interface for the PostgreSQL database.
  This module implements the network protocol that allows a client to
  communicate with a PostgreSQL server, so you don't need an external PostgreSQL
  client library like libpq for it to work.  That means this module enables you
  to connect to PostgreSQL server from platforms where there's no PostgreSQL
  port, or where installing PostgreSQL is prohibitively hard.

INSTALLATION

  1. Copy DBD/PgPPSjis.pm to @INC directory.

DEPENDENCIES

  This module uses the following other modules and libraries:

    DBI
    IO::Socket (ships with supported Perl versions)
    Digest::MD5 (ships with supported Perl versions)

TESTING

  The test suite requires access to a suitable PostgreSQL server; without
  that, only an extremely limited form of testing is possible.

  To tell the test suite how to find a PostgreSQL server, set the following
  environment variables:

  DBI_DSN (required)
    A DBI "data source name" indicating the location of the database.  For
    example, to connect to the database named "abc" over a Unix-domain
    socket stored in /var/run/postgresql, use this DSN:

      export DBI_DSN='dbi:PgPPSjis:dbname=abc;path=/var/run/postgresql'

    Or to connect to a database of the same name, using a TCP connection to
    pg.example.com, use this:

      export DBI_DSN='dbi:PgPPSjis:dbname=abc;host=pg.example.com'

    See the DBD::PgPPSjis documentation for full details on what can go into
    a DBD::PgPPSjis DSN.

  DBI_USER (optional)
    The username to connect as; defaults to the database name

  DBI_PASS (optional)
    The password needed to allow the given user to authenticate to the
    server.  Some configurations of PostgreSQL allow connection without a
    password; you don't need to set a DBI_PASS in such cases.

REPORTING BUGS

  If you find what seems to be a bug in DBD::PgPPSjis, please use RT to report
  it to the maintainers:

    http://rt.cpan.org/NoAuth/Bugs.html?Dist=DBD-PgPPSjis

  Please supply any information that could help with reproducing the bug.
  For example, if the bug only appears when DBD::PgPPSjis is used with certain
  database schemas, a description (or even a dump) of the schema in question
  would be useful.
