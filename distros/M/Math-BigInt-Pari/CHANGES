 * Sync test files with Math-BigInt.

1.3007 2021-07-02

 * Sync test files with Math-BigInt.

 * Sync test files with Math-BigInt.

1.3005 2018-10-09

 * Update MANIFEST.SKIP.

 * Sync test files with Math-BigInt.

 * Better Makefile.PL.

1.3004 2018-04-17

 * The tests now require Test::More version 0.88 or newer.

 * Sync test files with Math-BigInt.

 * Add test files t/release-test-version.t, t/release-portability.t, and
   t/release-cpan-changes.t.

 * Use a MANIFEST.SKIP file based on the default file in the ExtUtils-Manifest
   distribution.

 * Format CHANGES according to CPAN::Changes::Spec.

 * Convert test file t/02pod.t to t/release-pod.t and t/03podcov.t to
   t/release-pod-coverage.t.

1.3003 2017-01-11 pjacklam

 * Fix syntax for required version of Math::BigInt::Lib.

 * Better checking of POD coverage.

 * Sync test files with Math-BigInt-1.999808.

 * _from_hex() now accepts input without a "0x" prefix.

 * _from_bin() is more now efficient as it utilises the fact that
   Math::Pari::_hex_cvt() assumes the input is binary if the strings is
   prefixed by "0b".

 * Implement _to_hex(), _to_oct(), and _to_bin() for conversion to hexadecimal,
   octal, and binary without prefix.

 * Fix _nok() to work around a bug in Math::Pari::binomial(). It doesn't
   correctly handle cases where both n and k are very large.

 * Correct a few cases where non-OO syntax was used, e.g., "$x = _one();"
   should be "$x = $class -> _one();".

 * _inc() and _dec() now uses post-increment and post-decrement, respectively,
   rather than adding or subtracting one.

 * In test file t/01load.t, display the PARI library version number.

1.3002 2016-12-03 pjacklam

 * Use ExtUtils::MakeMaker rather than Module::Install in Makefile.PL

 * Remove author information in LICENSE file.

1.3001 2016-11-23 pjacklam

 * Sync test files with Math-BigInt-1.999801. Add t/mbi_rand.t, t/mbimbf.t,
   and t/mbimbf.inc since these are included in the test suite for the other
   backend libraries (GMP and Pari).

 * Add _nok() by using Pari's binomial() function.

 * Add _lcm() by using Pari's lcm() function.

1.3000 2016-11-15 pjacklam

 * Sync test files with Math-BigInt-1.999800.

 * Math::BigInt::Pari is now a subclass of Math::BigInt::Lib, so remove pure
   Perl methods from Math::BigInt::Pari that are implemented in the superclass
   Math::BigInt::Lib. The methods removed are _modinv() and _log_int(). The
   version of _log_int() implemented in Math::BigInt::GMP was buggy anyway.

 * Add methods _str() and _set(), and correct _num() method.

1.27 2016-04-25 pjacklam

 * Sync test files with Math-BigInt-1.999719.

 * Sync test files with Math-BigInt-1.999713.

1.23 2015-11-22 pjacklam

 * Sync test files with Math-BigInt-1.999709.

 * In v1.22 the required version of Math-BigInt was set to 1.999703, but it
   should have been 1.999706. The required version is now 1.999709.

 * Correct error in CHANGES file.

1.22 2015-11-09 pjacklam

 * Sync test files with Math-BigInt-1.999709.

 * Update the README file.

 * Remove the LICENSE file as this information is already covered in the file
   README.

 * Replace 'use vars ...' with 'our ...'. We require a Perl newer than 5.6.0
   anyway.

 * Move 'Test::More' from 'build_requires' to 'test_requires' in Makefile.PL.

 * Enable 'use warnings'. We require a Perl newer than 5.6.0 anyway.

 * Add 'assertlib.*\.exe' to MANIFEST.SKIP, since make generates temporary
   files like 'assertlibzxjE4WfG.exe' on Cygwin.

1.21 2015-09-21 pjacklam

 * Sync test files with Math-BigInt-1.999703.

 * Required version of Math-BigInt is now 1.999703.

 t/*.t
  * Add "use warnings" to test scripts, since Perl 5.6.2 is required anyway,
    and "use warnings" was introduced in Perl 5.6.1.
  * Modified test scripts so the difference between the test files in the
    Math-BigInt distribution and the backend distributions are as few and as
    small as possible. This makes for easier release management.

   copy:  5 secs ( 5.19 usr + 0.06 sys = 5.25 CPU) @ 27047.05/s (n=141997)
 - digit() now uses a method that scales much better when extracting digits
   counting from the right side ($n > 0)
 - likeweise, _inc and _dec use $one instead of PARI(0). Benchmark over
   Math::BigInt->bdec() and binc() (not just _inc() and _dec()!):

   1.08, 100 and 1000 digit numbers (speed is largely irrel. of number size):

 - Math::Pari has _hex_cvt(), which makes from_hex() fast, but doesn't have
   something for from_bin(). Now _from_bin() repacks the input as hex number
   and then passes it to _hex_cvt().
 - tests from Math::BigInt v1.51

1.06 2002-02-10 Tels

1.03  2001.09.02 btrott
 - Incorporated Tels's changes: no longer need to EXPORT_OK functions;
   added empty import method.
 - Added _as_hex and _as_bin implementations for Math::Pari integers,
   to support as_hex and as_bin Math::BigInt methods.

1.02  2001.08.05 btrott
 - Added _gcd method; uses PARI library function to return gcd.
 - Incorporated Tels's changes: _copy() is now linear; _is_zero,
   _is_one, is_even, and is_odd now use PARI library functions
   rather than overloaded ops and should thus be faster. Also
   added new tests from Math::BigInt 1.40.

1.01  2001.07.14 btrott
 - Incorporated Tels's changes per calling args to plugin methods
   (now class is *always* the first arg, so no more checking).
   Fixed some tests per Math::BigInt changes.

1.00  2001.07.11 btrott
 - Initial release.
