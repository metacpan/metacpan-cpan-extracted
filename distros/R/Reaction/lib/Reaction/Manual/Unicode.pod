=head1 NAME

Reaction::Manual::Unicode - Unicode support in Reaction

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document gives you notes about using Unicode in Reaction.

=head1 Working with Catalyst

Catalyst has a plugin which is named L<Catalyst::Plugin::Unicode>, It decodes
the request parameters to utf8 when preparing parameters, and decodes the
response body after the request is finalized. Since, Reaction uses utf8 by
default, and does this already. So, you should avoid using the
L<Catalyst::Plugin::Unicode>.

=head1 Note about LayoutSet

LayoutSet files B<MUST> be in utf8, since ASCII is a subset of utf8, You don't
need to worry about anything if you are using plain ASCII. But people who uses
CJK, must be sure to configure your editors to save files in utf8.

=head1 Note about Database

If you don't see the correct result. Be sure to double check the database
related configuration (connecting parameter or database server side config for
example). Database B<MUST> be configured to use utf8. Reaction won't decode or
encode anything. It just return the data as it is from database.
