Revision history for Perl extension App::Env.
0.33  2016-07-13T12:16:55-0400

  [BUG FIX]

    * improper method call check in import()

  [ENHANCEMENT]

    * appexec

        * new --clear option to clear the current environment prior to
	  loading a new environment

        * multiple environments may be loaded


0.32  2016-07-07T12:50:00-0400

  [BUG FIX]

    * avoid warnings from appexec when environment variables have
      no defined value

0.31  2016-07-06T17:26:56-0400

  [BUG FIX]

    * bash shell export support in version 0.30 wasn't complete;
      it didn't produce output which could be eval'ed.

0.30  2016-07-06T17:11:43-0400

  [BUG FIX]

    * bash exports shell functions via special environment variables
      with nominally illegal names. when dumping the environment for
      bash, appexec will translate those variables into function
      definitions instead of simply passing along the bogus variable
      names, which causes bash to barf.

0.29  2016-03-16T13:37:06-0400

  [BUG FIX]

    * exceptions caught by App::Env were stringified when rethrown,
      breaking calling code which might expect an exception object.

0.28  2015-05-21T10:55:07-0400

  [BUILD]

    * missing semicolon in Makefile.PL caused incomplete META.* files
      to be written.

0.27  2015-05-20T17:22:12-0400

  [BUILD]

    * use cpanfile to manage dependencies
    * move all author tests to xt

0.26  2012-03-29T15:47:34-0400

  [ENHANCEMENT]

    * added App::Env::Null module for "null" (i.e. current)
      environment

0.25  2012-01-13T12:43:22-0400

  [BUG FIX]

    * qexec always acted as if it were being called in a scalar
      context.


0.24  2010-06-07T17:14:37-0400

    * the SysFatal option will now be passed on to cloned environments
      created with the Temp option.

0.23  2010-06-07T16:44:26-0400

    * capture() is no longer just an alias for qexec; it can now
      return both stderr and stdout.

0.22  2010-06-03T12:44:43-0400

    * if CacheID is the string 'AppID', the cache id does not take
      into account the contents of the AppOpts hash.

    * new feature from v. 0.20 2015-05-20T16:52:10-0400 AppOpts hash)
      now actually works.

0.21  2010-06-02T10:28:42-0400

    * no longer uses Object::ID to work around problems with
      Hash::FieldHash and older perls.

0.20  2010-05-28T12:11:51-0400

    * cached environments now keyed off of AppOpts hash
    * (hopefully) improve Windows compatibility

0.15  2008-10-27T14:10:29-0400

    * invert logic of shell magic characters; escape those not known to
      good.

0.14  2008-07-11T21:17:02-0400

    * escape more shell magic characters

0.13  2008-07-11T15:59:30-0400

    * append semi-colons to appenv's dumpenv output so that shell
      eval's will actually work

0.12  2008-07-11T13:31:09-0400

    * appenv's dumpenv has more output formats. its value is now required.
      previously it was optional, which led to its grabbing
      the environment name if --env wasn't used. bad form.

0.11  2008-06-16T12:27:20-0400

    * new setenv() method allows changing an environment.

0.10  2008-06-15T23:26:29-0400

    * new SysFatal option which will cause system/qexec/capture object
      methods to throw an exception on error.  Uses
      IPC::System::Simple in this case.

    * Default option values may now be changed.

 0.09  2008-03-22T22:44:32-0400

    * lowercase aliasing failed if Site was not set.

0.08  2008-03-22T22:03:47-0400

    * application module search is no longer sensitive to the case of
      the application name

0.07  2008-03-22T13:19:29-0400

    * application environments may now have aliases, which can preset
      options

    * site search was not done exactly according to specs

    * improved method for searching for environment modules to
      distinguish between non-existant modules and compilation errors

    * env() (and now str() as well) can specify variables to include
      in a more flexible fashion.  the returned value is more flexible
      (more context dependent) and excruciatingly documented.

    * more restrictive str() generation of TERMCAP to make it easier
      to exclude variables without needing to specify TERMCAP


0.06  2008-02-03T14:11:39-0400

    * fix for multi-app environments

    * application environments must now be based upon the current
      environment

    * cached application environments are not used in multi-app
      environments, nor will individual environments be cached in the
      course of creating a multi-app environment

0.05  2008-01-17T15:15:38-0400

    * improve(?) documentation

    * add appexec program

 0.04  2007-08-17T17:02:34-0400

    * clean up passing of AppOpts to app env module's envs() func

0.03  2007-08-17T12:26:32-0400

    * remove dependency on Module::Load::Conditional

0.02  2007-08-16T17:10:27-0400

    * work around lack of weak references in older perls

0.01  2007-07-26T17:39:40-0400

    * original version; created by h2xs 1.23 2015-05-20T16:52:10-0400
