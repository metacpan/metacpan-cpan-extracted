        [FEATURES]
        * Added LINKBASE configuration variable to define base of the
          URLs created by L<> links.  Thanks Pete Krawczyk.

        [FIXES]
        * URI-encodes the links in Apache::Pod::HTML.  Thanks to Chris
          Eade.

        [FEATURES]
        * Added INDEX and GZIP options.  Thanks to Kjetil Skotheim.

        [FIXES]
        * Uses C<< $r->print >> instead of bare C<print> to generate
          output.  This is more portable.  Thanks to Kate Yoak.
        * Added a dependency on Apache::Constants.

0.10    May 10, 2004
        [FEATURES]
        * Pod links link to the filename.  Thereform, L<foo.pod> links
        to foo.pod, instead of "TODO".  This is only until Sean does
        his magic in Pod::Simple::HTML so this fudgery isn't needed.

        [FIXES]
        * Handlers now properly return OK.

        [INTERNALS]
        * Now overriding Pod::Simple::HTML.

          Grant McLean for the patch.
