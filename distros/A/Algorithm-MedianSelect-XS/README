NAME
    Algorithm::MedianSelect::XS - Median finding algorithm

SYNOPSIS
     use Algorithm::MedianSelect::XS qw(median);

     @numbers = (21, 6, 2, 9, 5, 1, 14, 7, 12, 3, 19);

     print median(@numbers);
     print median(\@numbers);

     print median(\@numbers, { algorithm => 'bubble' }); # slow algorithm
     print median(\@numbers, { algorithm => 'quick'  }); # default algorithm

DESCRIPTION
    "Algorithm::MedianSelect::XS" finds the item which is smaller than half
    of the integers and bigger than half of the integers.

FUNCTIONS
  median
    Takes a list or reference to list of integers and returns the median
    number. Optionally, the algorithm being used for computation may be
    specified within a hash reference. See SYNOPSIS for algorithms currently
