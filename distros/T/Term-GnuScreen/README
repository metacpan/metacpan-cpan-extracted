NAME
    Term::GnuScreen - control GNU screen

VERSION
    Version 0.05

SYNOPSIS
    Term::GnuScreen provides a simple interface to control a GNU screen
    session via its command line interface.

        use Term::GnuScreen;

        my $screen = Term::GnuScreen->new();
        $screen->windowlist;
        $screen->hardcopy('/tmp/my_hardcopy');

CONSTRUCTION
    session
        Sets the name of the screen session to which commands are send. If
        you also set "create" to a true value, this will become the new name
        of your screen session. See *-S* option for screen for a further
        discussion of this argument.

    create
        If create is set to a true value, a new screen session is created
        and detached automatically. If you do not provide a session name via
        *session*, this module generates one by calling ""term_gnuscreen" .
        $$ . int(rand(10000))". Settings this value after object creation
        has no effect at the moment.

        The newly created session will not be terminated after program
        execution.

    window
        Preselects a window. Defaults to 0. See *-p* option of screen for a
        further discussion of this argument.

    executable
        Return or set the screen binary to call. Defaults to the binary
        found by "File::Which::which("screen")".

    debugging
        If debugging is set to a true value, all commands are printed to
        STDERR.

METHODS
    Term::GnuScreen implements all commands as stated in the texinfo
    document shipped with GNU screen. Whenever you call a command it is send
    via GNU screens -X parameter to the first running screen session and its
    current window. You can change session and window with the according
    object methods and construction parameters. Unless listed here, all
    remaining arguments are handed over to screen without further
    modification.

    The five commands bind, kill, meta, chdir, exec and umask are prefixed
    with a *s* (sbind, smeta, schdir, sexec and sumask) to distinguish them
    from the built-ins with the same name.

  call_screen
    This command is the working horse of Term::GnuScreen. It simply builds
    the command line to call and execute it.

  send_command
    Calls call_screen with the *-X* and all supplied parameters. Most
    functions are implemented by this method.

  hardcopy
    Write a hardcopy of the current window to a temporary file and returns
    the filename unless the filename is supplied as first argument. If the
    supplied filename is not absolute, the file is written relative to
    "hardcopydir".

ERROR HANDLING
    Simple dies in case screen -X did not return with a return value of
    zero. Either $!, STDERR or STDOUT (which seems to be more helpful most
    times) are provided as error message for further investigation.

BUGS AND LIMITATIONS
    It seems not to be possible to question a specific screen session about
    its state, so this module basically just sends commands to a screen
    session without knowing if the command succeeded or was even
    syntactically correct.

    This module needs a lot more testing.

    Please report any bugs or feature requests to "bug-term-gnuscreen at
    rt.cpan.org", or through the web interface at
    <http://rt.cpan.org/NoAuth/ReportBug.html?Queue=Term-GnuScreen>. I will
    be notified, and then you'll automatically be notified of progress on
    your bug as I make changes.
