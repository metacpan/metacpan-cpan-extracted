NAME
    Catalyst::Action::RenderView - Sensible default end action.

SYNOPSIS
        sub end : ActionClass('RenderView') {}

DESCRIPTION
    This action implements a sensible default end action, which will forward
    to the first available view, unless "$c->res->status" is a 3xx code
    (redirection, not modified, etc.), 204 (no content), or "$c->res->body"
    has already been set. It also allows you to pass "dump_info=1" to the
    url in order to force a debug screen, while in debug mode.

    If you have more than one view, you can specify which one to use with
    the "default_view" config setting and the "current_view" and
    "current_view_instance" stash keys (see Catalyst's "$c->view($name)"
    method -- this module simply calls "$c->view" with no argument).

METHODS
  end
    The default "end" action. You can override this as required in your
    application class; normal inheritance applies.

INTERNAL METHODS
  execute
    Dispatches control to superclasses, then forwards to the default View.

    See "METHODS/action" in Catalyst::Action.

SCRUBBING OUTPUT
    When you force debug with dump_info=1, RenderView is capable of removing
    classes from the objects in your stash. By default it will replace any
    DBIx::Class resultsource objects with the class name, which cleans up
    the debug output considerably, but you can change what gets scrubbed by
    setting a list of classes in
    $c->config->{'Action::RenderView'}->{ignore_classes}. For instance:

        $c->config->{'Action::RenderView'}->{ignore_classes} = [];

    To disable the functionality. You can also set
    config->{'Action::RenderView'}->{scrubber_func} to change what it does
    with the classes. For instance, this will undef it instead of putting in
    the class name:

        $c->config->{'Action::RenderView'}->{scrubber_func} = sub { undef $_ };

  Deprecation notice
    This plugin used to be configured by setting "$c->config->{debug}". That
    configuration key is still supported in this release, but is deprecated,
    please use the 'Action::RenderView' namespace as shown above for
    configuration in new code.

EXTENDING
    To add something to an "end" action that is called before rendering,
    simply place it in the "end" method:

        sub end : ActionClass('RenderView') {
          my ( $self, $c ) = @_;
          # do stuff here; the RenderView action is called afterwards
        }

    To add things to an "end" action that are called *after* rendering, you
    can set it up like this:

        sub render : ActionClass('RenderView') { }

        sub end : Private { 
          my ( $self, $c ) = @_;
          $c->forward('render');
          # do stuff here
        }
