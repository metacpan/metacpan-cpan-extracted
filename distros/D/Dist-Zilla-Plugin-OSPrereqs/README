NAME
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::OSPrereqs - List prereqs conditional on operating
    system

VERSION
    version 0.008

SYNOPSIS
    In your dist.ini:

      [OSPrereqs / MSWin32]
      Win32API::File = 0.11

    Some prefixes are recognized, i.e. "!" (not), "~" (regex match), "!~"
    (regex non-match). Regex matches are done case-insensitively for
    convenience:

      ; require on non-Win32 system
      [OSPrereqs / !MSWin32]
      Proc::ProcessTable = 0.50

      ; require on BSD
      [OSPrereqs / ~bsd]
      BSD::Resource=0

      ; require on non-Windows system
      [OSPrereqs / !win]
      Proc::ProcessTable = 0.50

DESCRIPTION
    This Dist::Zilla plugin allows you to specify OS-specific prerequisites.
    You must give the plugin a name corresponding to an operating system
    that would appear in $^O. Any prerequisites listed will be conditionally
    added to "PREREQ_PM" in the Makefile.PL

WARNING
    This plugin works for Makefile.PL generated by the
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::MakeMaker plugin or the Build.PL generated by the
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::ModuleBuild plugin, and must appear in your
    dist.ini after whichever you use.

    This plugin is a fairly gross hack, based on the technique used for
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::DualLife and might break if/when Dist::Zilla
    changes how it generates install scripts.
