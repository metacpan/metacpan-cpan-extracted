Revision history for Perl extension Carp::Assert::More.


2.1.0   Mon Aug 15 19:54:27 CDT 2022
        [ENHANCEMENTS]
        Add diagnostic strings to the failures. For example:

            assert_nonblank( [ 'foo' ], 'This should be nonblank' );

        would fail with:

            Assertion (This should be nonblank) failed!

        but now fails with:

            Assertion (This should be nonblank) failed!
            Value is a reference to ARRAY.

        Similar changes have been made to:
        * assert_all_keys_in
        * assert_keys_are
        * assert_empty
        * assert_nonempty


2.0.1   Fri Aug 13 11:57:15 CDT 2021
        [FIXES]
        assert_all_keys_in() mistakenly required a non-empty list of
        keys to check.

        [ENHANCEMENTS]
        Sped up assert_isa_in(), assert_is().


2.0.0   Thu Aug 12 23:00::00 CDT 2021
        [DIFFERENCES]
        Now requires Perl 5.10 or higher.  No longer requires Carp::Assert.

        The numeric functions are more stringent now.  If it expects
        a number, then you need to pass a number.  For example,
        assert_nonnegative($x) would pass if $x was a non-numeric
        string. Now it must be numeric.

        assert_empty() and assert_nonempty() no longer gives a message
        of "Not an array or hash reference".  If you don't pass an array
        or hash reference, the assertion will just fail with the message
        passe3d in.

        assert_aoh() and assert_datetime() no longer provide a default
        message.

        assert_in() is more strict. Each element of the target array
        is checked to not be a reference.

        assert_exists() and assert_lacks() are more strict.  The list
        of keys to check cannot be empty.

        [ENHANCEMENTS]
        Most of the functions are about twice as fast because of reduced
        number of function calls internally.

        Added assert_context_nonvoid() and assert_context_scalar()
        to assert on how the executing function has been called.

        assert_in() now lets you use undef as both the needle and one
        of the values in the haystack.


1.26    Sat Dec 26 00:26:23 CST 2020
        [ENHANCEMENTS]
        Add assert_arrayref_nonempty().

        Add assert_hashref_nonempty().

1.24    Tue Oct  6 22:37:06 CDT 2020
        [ENHANCEMENTS]
        The requirement for Perl 5.10 has been reverted to 5.6.1.

1.22    Tue Oct  6 22:03:55 CDT 2020
        [ENHANCEMENTS]
        Add assert_keys_are() for asserting an exact list of keys.

1.20    Fri Aug  9 10:10:06 CDT 2019
        [ENHANCEMENTS]
        Add assert_datetime() for asserting DateTime objects.

1.18    Fri Jul 19 17:12:32 CDT 2019
        [ENHANCEMENTS]
        Added assert_aoh() for asserting an array of hashrefs.

1.16    Fri Aug  4 14:18:51 CDT 2017
        [ENHANCEMENTS]
        Added the following functions:
        * assert_numeric( $n )
        * assert_all_keys_in( \%hash, \@keylist )
        * assert_empty( [\%hash|\@list] )
        * assert_coderef( $ref )
        * assert_isa_in( $ref, \@class_list )
        Thanks to Eric A. Zarko for some of them.  The rest were migrated
        from a private code project.

        Renamed assert_listref() to assert_arrayref(), but keep
        assert_listref() as backward compatibility.  assert_listref()
        may go away in the future.

        [DOCUMENTATION]
        Fixed a goof in the assert_integer() docs.  Thanks, Randy Lauen.

1.14    Wed Oct 31 11:37:04 CDT 2012
        [ENHANCEMENTS]
        Added assert_undefined() for Ben Hengst.

        Added assert_unlike().

        [FIXES]
        assert_nonblank() wasn't using the correct message.  Thanks to
        Leland Johnson.

        assert_nonempty() wouldn't work on blessed arrays and refs.
        Now it will.

1.12    Oct 14 2005
        [ENHANCEMENTS]
        * Added assert_nonnegative() and assert_nonnegative_integer().
        * Added assert_lacks().  Thanks to Bob Diss.

1.10    Wed Feb 16 12:52:16 CST 2005
        [FIXES]
        * Fixed assert_positive_integer() to not pass "14.".

1.08    Wed Nov 24 11:44:34 CST 2004
        [ENHANCEMENTS]
        * Added assert_is() and assert_isnt()
        * Organized the functions into logical groupings.

        [INTERNALS]
        * Now requires Test::Exception.
        * Added t/pod.t and t/pod-coverage.t


1.06    Sat Oct 30 23:50:45 CDT 2004
        * No functionality changes.  Just added a Copyright notice to
          so we can put it in Debian.

1.04    Mon Oct 18 10:21:37 CDT 2004
        [ENHANCEMENTS]
        * assert_isa() is now aware of subclasses.

        [FIXES]
        * $names weren't getting passed to sub-assertions.  Now they are.

        [DOCUMENTATION]
        * Documentation fix.

        This is the "all thanks to Allard Hoeve" release.

1.02    Tue Oct  5 17:31:56 CDT 2004
        [ENHANCEMENTS]
        * Added assert_hashref() and assert_listref().  Thanks to Dan
          Friedman.

1.00    Wed Sep 22 10:14:28 CDT 2004
        * First real official version.  I'm not sure what's different
          between this and 0.04.

        * Added a bunch of new assert_* functions.  Thanks David
          Storrs and Pete Krawczyk.
