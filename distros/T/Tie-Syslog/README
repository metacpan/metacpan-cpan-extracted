Tie::Syslog
===========

SYNOPSIS
========

    use Tie::Syslog;

    $Tie::Syslog::ident  = "my logging tag";
    $Tie::Syslog::logopt = "pid,ndelay';

    # Tie STDOUT to Syslog, so that every print()ed message will be logged
    tie *STDOUT, 'Tie::Syslog', {
        facility => 'LOG_LOCAL0',
        priority => 'LOG_INFO',
    };

    # Now tie STDERR also, getting parameters from the tied STDOUT
    tie *STDERR, { tied *STDOUT };

    # ...or...

    # tie STDERR with defaults from tied STDOUT, but override priority:
    tie *STDERR, { tied *STDOUT }, {
        priority => 'LOG_ERR',
    };

    ###### 
    # Compatibility with old configuration style:

    tie *STDOUT, 'Tie::Syslog', 
        'local0.debug',         # facility.loglevel
        'myname',               # identity 
        'pid,ndelay',           # Other Sys::Syslog options, comma-separated
        'unix';                 # setlogsock socket type: unix or inet

    tie *STDERR, 'Tie::Syslog', 
        'local0.warning',       # facility.loglevel
        'myname',               # USE THE SAME AS ABOVE!
        'pid,ndelay',           # USE THE SAME AS ABOVE!
        'unix';                 # USE THE SAME AS ABOVE!

    # Tying by copying from another tied handle is not supported in 
    # old-compatibility-mode

    # old-compatibility-mode defaults to 'local0.error'

    # socket type is IGNORED



DESCRIPTION 
===========

From the original README: 
    This module allows you to tie a filehandle (output only) to
    syslog. This becomes useful in general when you want to
    capture any activity that happens on STDERR and see that it
    is syslogged for later perusal. You can also create an arbitrary
    filehandle, say LOG, and send stuff to syslog by printing to
    this filehandle. This module depends on the Sys::Syslog module
    to actually get info to syslog.
    
    When used with STDERR, combined with the good habit of using
    the perl -w switch, this module happens to be useful in
    catching unexpected errors in any of your code, or team's
    code. Tie::Syslog is pretty brain-dead. However, it can
    become quite flexible if you investigate your options with
    the actual syslog daemon. Syslog has a variety of options
    available, including notifying console, logging to other
    machines running syslog, or email support in the event of
    Bad Things. Consult your syslog documentation to get
    /etc/syslog.conf setup by your sysadmin and use Tie::Syslog
    to get information into those channels.

Tie::Syslog v2.00 is a complete rewrite of the original Tie::Syslog v1.x, 
trying to preserve as much as possible the old syntax and the original 
philosophy. All the dirty work has been moved to Sys::Syslog.
