v0.48.0   2016-10-03 11:59:09-07:00 America/Los_Angeles

	! Escaped curly brace failure for perl v5.25.5
	! permanantly added the Log::Shiras::LogSpace role to ~::CSVFile and ~::PostgreSQL Report classes
	+ Added a check in the Log::Shiras::LogSpace default to exclude the substring matching get_class_space

v0.46.0   2016-09-20 09:43:36-07:00 America/Los_Angeles

	! Improvements to some POD
	! I broke the use_strict kwalitee test so I over fixed it( I think Moose should count but Kwalitee doesn't agree )

v0.44.0   2016-09-19 11:30:03-07:00 America/Los_Angeles

	+ Changed the fatal behaviour (back) to fail after logging instead of before
		This means the failure doesn't happen until it leaves the buffer if the message was buffered.
	+ Upgraded these three simple classes to Moose clases so log instantiation behaviour would be consistent
		Log::Shiras::Report::Stdout, Log::Shiras::Report::Test2Note, Log::Shiras::Report::Test2Diag
	! Fixed the missing clone method in the ~::Telephone for the 'ask' key

v0.42.0   2016-09-13 12:20:53-07:00 America/Los_Angeles

	+ Additional POD changes
	! Updated Text::CSV_XS requirements to 1.25 to possibly handle some perl 5.10 fails with Autoloader

v0.40.2   2016-09-12 14:31:20-07:00 America/Los_Angeles

	+ Minor POD changes
	+ Added Log::Shiras::Report::Test2Diag
	+ Added the ability to pass $add_string to get_all_space in Log::Shiras::LogSpace
	+ Increased the level of die reporting in 01-csv.t in order to troubleshoot some CPAN testers fails

	! Role back coverage tests to 5.22

v0.38.2   2016-09-10 16:42:11-07:00 America/Los_Angeles

	+ Changed .travis.yml to run coverage on 5.24
	+ Made several improvements to the top level POD

v0.38.0   2016-09-10 08:03:18-07:00 America/Los_Angeles

	+ CPAN release candidate

v0.37.13  2016-09-10 07:52:30-07:00 America/Los_Angeles 

	(cumulative since v0.30.0)
	! Block unicore/* scrubbing in ~::Unhide
	! Fixed for 04-telephone.t  failing in perl 5.16 and 5.18
	! Added requirement for Filter::Util::Call to test

v0.30.0   2016-09-09 14:20:26-07:00 America/Los_Angeles

	+ Updated version numbers for an initial CPAN release

v0.29_1   2016-09-09 14:03:12-07:00 America/Los_Angeles (TRIAL RELEASE)

	+ The goal is to create an initial CPAN release here
	+ This includes a substantial rework of the Unhide implementation
	+ Added line numbers to TapPrint and TapWarn namespace generation to allow for by-line control
	+ Substantially reworked the CSVFile report to consume arrayrefs and hashrefs rather than print lines
	+ Substantially reworked ShirasFormat Type to be an element modification class Log::Shiras::Report::MetaMethod
		I might take the ShirasFormat out altogether since it was too tricky for it's own good
