SH] from the last two examples i can see why BaseLib might
SH] prove to be useful/convenient: it deals nicely with
SH] different versions of an application which a single user
SH] might run, where as it would be cumbersome to set
SH] different environment variables everytime one needs to
SH] switch versions. in addition it works with -T because it
SH] doesn't rely on the environment.

That's what I avoid. But there's still a tainted data, that's
the full path to script directory from FindBin. That's why
the data needs to be untainted first.


SH] so BaseLib-based scripts basically first uses FindBin to
SH] find itself, but then, instead of using relative path to
SH] connect to its LIBDIR, it looks for LIBDIR in its own
SH] path, because it must be there! (well, as long as LIBDIR
SH] is specified correctly). simple, but clever. now why
SH] hadn't the rest of us thought of that before? :-)

Yes, there must be some convention here. Both BASEDIR and
LIBDIR must be rather static. That's why I said (in my
answer in clp.misc), when those variable change, that's
a different level of decision. It of course affects the
usage of BaseLib.

I first implemented this mechanism in the last project I
was involved in. I realized that I was not the only who
worked on this project and everyone worked in their own
environment.

So I put the mechanism in every script using BEGIN block
so everyone didn't need to change anything just because
they had different environment from mine. Later I thought,
hey why I didn't put it on a module. So my very first posting
was actually some kind of a module proposal. But folks at
clp.misc seemed misunderstanding what I meant.

SH] 
SH] sorry. lib.pm does already include the architecture-dependent
SH] directory.

I think I said incorrectly. What I wanted to say is that I want
to provide the same facility in BaseLib like what lib.pm does. So
BaseLib will accommodate the standard hierarchy under BASEDIR/LIBDIR
should the hierarchy exists.

SH] you're most welcome.

Thank you very much :-)
