OpenAPI::Client::OpenAI::Path::uploads - Documentation for the /uploads path.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document describes the API endpoint at C</uploads>.

=head1 PATHS


=head2 C<POST /uploads>

Create upload


Creates an intermediate L<Upload|https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/uploads/object> object
that you can add L<Parts|https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/uploads/part-object> to.
Currently, an Upload can accept at most 8 GB in total and expires after an
hour after you create it.

Once you complete the Upload, we will create a
L<File|https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/files/object> object that contains all the parts
you uploaded. This File is usable in the rest of our platform as a regular
File object.

For certain C<purpose> values, the correct C<mime_type> must be specified. 
Please refer to documentation for the 
L<supported MIME types for your use case|https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/tools/file-search#supported-files>.

For guidance on the proper filename extensions for each purpose, please
follow the documentation on L<creating a
File|https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/files/create>.
