1.0 SCOPE
    This paragraph identifies and provides an overview of the released
    files.

  1.1 Identification
    This release, identified in 3.2, is a collection of Perl modules that
    extend the capabilities of the Perl language.

  1.2 System overview
    This release adds United States Department of Defense (US DOD) Perl
    Plain Old Documentation (POD) derived from software related documents
    release by the US DOD to the general public.

    These documents and the terminology used in these documents govern much
    of the Software Development including design, test, distribution,
    release, installation and use of software.

    One area of praticular interest is development software that automates
    development tasks freeing up designers, technicians and other personell
    to concentrate on key development tasks.

    Toward this end, two starting modules that make heavy references to the
    these 2167A documents are the following modules:

    Test::STDmaker
        Generates 2167A STD DID, demonstration script, and test script from
        a STD text database in a format consistent with
        DataPort::FileType::FormDB.

    ExtUtils::SVDmaker
        Generates 2167A SVD DID, MakeFile.PL, README, MANIFEST, updates file
        versions and creates .tar.gz distribution file from a SVD text
        database in a format consistent with DataPort::FileType::FormDB.

        The dependency of the program modules in the US DOD STD2167A bundle
        is as follows:

         File::Package File::SmartNL File::TestPath Text::Scrub

             Test::Tech

                DataPort::FileType::FormDB DataPort::DataFile DataPort::Maker 
                File::AnySpec File::Data File::PM2File File::SubPM Text::Replace 
                Text::Column

                    Test::STDmaker ExtUtils::SVDmaker

  1.3 Document overview.
    This document releases Docs-US_DOD-STD2167A version 0.06 and provides a
    description of the inventory, installation instructions and other
    information necessary to utilize and track this release.

  3.3 Changes
    Changes are as follows:

    Docs::US_DOD::STD2167A 0.03
        Version 0.02 loaded test file t/Docs/US_DOD/STD2167A.t but specified
        test file t/docs/US_DOD/STD2167A.t. Works on case insensitive file
        specs OS such as MsDOS but fails on case sensitive file specs OS
        such as Unix

        Changed the test file

        From:

         t/docs/US_DOD/STD2167A.t

        To:

         t/Docs/US_DOD/STD2167A.t

    Docs::US_DOD::STD2167A 0.04 =item Docs::US_DOD::STD2167A 0.05
        Another case insensitive issue. The STrP has one lower case letter.
        Make changes so everything should match the case. Unix file
        specifications are case sensitive while Microsoft's are not.

    Docs::US_DOD::STD2167A 0.06
        Deleted SRR and SDR which since they are review, have not document.

        Supplied contents for the following

         VDD.pm
         CRISD.pm
         CSOM.pm
         IDD.pm

  3.4 Adaptation data.
    This installation requires that the installation site has the Perl
    programming language installed. There are no other additional
    requirements or tailoring needed of configurations files, adaptation
    data or other software needed for this installation particular to any
    installation site.

  3.5 Related documents.
    There are no related documents needed for the installation and test of
    this release.

  3.6 Installation instructions.
    Instructions for installation, installation tests and installation
    support are as follows:

    Installation Instructions.
        To installed the release file, use the CPAN module in the Perl
        release or the INSTALL.PL script at the following web site:

         http://packages.SoftwareDiamonds.com

        Follow the instructions for the the chosen installation software.

        The distribution file is at the following respositories:

    Prerequistes.
         'File::Package' => '0',

    Security, privacy, or safety precautions.
        None.

    Installation Tests.
        Most Perl installation software will run the following test
        script(s) as part of the installation:

         t/Docs/US_DOD/STD2167A.t

    Installation support.
        If there are installation problems or questions with the
        installation contact

         603 882-0846 E<lt>support@SoftwareDiamonds.comE<gt>

  3.7 Possible problems and known errors
    None of the PODs contain any of the figures from the hard-copy versions.
    The following PODs do not contain any documents and an empty POD is
    included only to resolve links when the converted documents converted to
    PODs cites documents not converted to PODs:

     CDRL.pod
     CSCI.pod
     ECP.pod
     HWCI.pod
     SCN.pod
     SPM.pod
     SSD.pod

    For Perl module releases, these documents may not be applicable. Many of
    them are for large software applications and complex systems involving
    both hardware and software while others establish format, legally
    binding, contractual requirements between the supplier and consumer of
    the data. Neither of these apply for this document.

4.0 NOTES
    The following are useful acronyms:

    .pm extension for a Perl Library Module

    .t  extension for a Perl test script file

    DID Data Item Description

    POD Plain Old Documentation

        extension for a Software Vesion Description database file
