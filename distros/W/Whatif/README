Have you ever hankered after rollbacks outside of databases, the ability 
to throw your hands up in the air and scream "WHY $DIETY? WHY?" and skip 
back to a point in your life, or execution path, where it hadn't all    
gone horribly wrong?

Have you? HAVE YOU?

I know I have.

Whatif provides you with that oft requested second chance - simply 
die within a whatif {} block and you can have another go AS IF NOTHING  
HAD HAPPENED. It's like Groundhog Day. All over again. [0]

Not only that but Whatif, for a limited time only, provides you   
with a corresponding ifonly {} statement, executed after the death of a 
whatif {} block, that gives you some breathing space to clean up all the 
little mishaps and boos boos that you caused in the whatif {} block.

Hand crafted by Artisans from the world famous London.pm Crack Smoking  
Club Whatif is the tool no self respecting programmer should be   
without.
