Revision history for Perl distribution Win32-Mechanize-NotepadPlusPlus

v0.006001 2021-Mar-07
    - meta fix: turn off the auto-download on smoke tester machines,
      because it was causing fails

v0.006 2021-Mar-06
    - add getSettingsOnCloudPath() with test (#54)
    - add getLineNumberWidthMode(), setLineNumberWidthMode(), and
      the %LINENUMWIDTH enumeration with test (#54 addendeum)
    - test suite bug: with v7.9.1 and newer, replaceTargetText() changes
      the selection/getTargetText() value, so update the readback
      to be version agnostic (#57)
    - documentation error: fox %NPPIDM description in Notepad.pm (#53)
    - meta fix: make test suite pass on cpantesters smoke testers,
      even if smoke tester machine doesn't have Notepad++, or has
      an old, incompatible version (#56)

v0.005 2020-Oct-16
    - replace %ENCODINGKEY with %BUFFERENCODING, because the old hash
      had wrong values that didn't match getEncoding's return values
      (#50)
    - add setEncoding command to call NPPM_SETBUFFERENCODING
      as the logical pair to getEncoding (#51)

v0.004001 2020-Jun-20
    - fix bug in notepad->prompt(), which only used two of the three
      arguments, in wrong order (#47); test suite verifies default
      values for title and default when they aren't used
    - added new examples/pasteSpecial.pl to show how to paste a
      clipboard entry other than CF_TEXT into Notepad++

    - fix bug in propertyNames() which deleted final char (#45)
    - implemented helper methods: forEachLine, deleteLine, replaceWholeLine,
        replaceLine, flash, getWord, getCurrentWord, getUserLineSelection,
        getUserCharSelection (#15)
    - make setTarget an alias of setTargetRange, and write an alias of
        addText, for PythonScript compatibility (#15)
    - implemented new auto-wrapper to get searchInTarget and similar calls
        to work right (#42)
    - fixed replaceTarget() and replaceTargetRE() replacing target with the
        empty string (#41)

    - fix mistakes and missing information in the POD (#35)
    - add author tests for checking for autogen entries not in the
        message list, and also note scintilla messages missing
        from autogen that aren't manually implemented or deprecated
        (#34)
    - some NPP v7.8 messages were missing, so add them (#29)
        and add a make target to make that easier to do in the future
    - added version notes, to say which messages and enums require
        NPP v7.8 (because these are the SCI v4.2.0 updates)
    - runPluginsCommand() = fixed command cache feature and improved
        test (#30)
    - test suite: add delay in myTestHelpers to make sure there's
        enough time after Notepad++ started before trying to save the
        session (to avoid race condition with no files loaded yet)

v0.002 2020-Mar-21
    - Reorganize the hash variables for easier and clearer use going
        forward (#13)

    - editor->getFileEndPosition(): gives the end position of the
        whole document

        to npp-buffer.t
