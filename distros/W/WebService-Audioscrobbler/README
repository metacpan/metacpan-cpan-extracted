WebService-Audioscrobbler

This module aims to be a full implementation of a an object-oriented interface 
to the Audioscrobbler WebService API (as available on 
http://www.audioscrobbler.net/data/webservices/). Since version 0.04, the 
module fully supports data caching and, thus, complies to the service's 
recommended usage guides.

Audioscrobbler is a great service for tracking musical data of various sorts,
and its integration with the LastFM service (L<http://www.last.fm>) makes it
work even better. Audioscrobbler provides data regarding similarity between
artists, artists discography, tracks by musical genre (actually, by tags), 
top artists / tracks / albums / tags and how all of that related to your own
musical taste.
