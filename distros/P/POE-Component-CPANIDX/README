DESCRIPTION

    POE::Component::CPANIDX is a POE component for querying web servers
    that are running App::CPANIDX.

CONSTRUCTOR

    spawn

      Creates a new POE::Component::CPANIDX session.

      Takes one optional argument alias so you can set an alias on the
      component to send it events later.

      Returns an object reference which the following methods can be used
      on.

METHODS

    session_id

      Takes no arguments. Returns the POE::Session ID of the component.

    shutdown

      Takes no arguments. Terminates the component.

    query_idx

      event

	The name of the event that should be sent to the requesting session
	with the reply from the CPANIDX server. This is required.

      url

	The base url of the website that is running App::CPANIDX. This is
	required.

      cmd

	The query command to send to the server. This can be mod, dist,
	dists, corelist, auth, timestamp mirrors or topten. If no cmd is
	specified the component will default to timestamp. The first three
	commands require a search term.

      search

	The search term to use for the mod, dist, dists, auth, corelist
	commands.

      See OUTPUT EVENTS below for what will be sent to your session in
      reply.

      You may also set arbitary keys to pass arbitary data along with your
      request. These must be prefixed with an underscore _.

INPUT EVENTS

    These are POE events that the component will accept.

    shutdown

      Takes no arguments. Terminates the component.

    query_idx

      event

	The name of the event that should be sent to the requesting session
	with the reply from the CPANIDX server. This is required.

      url

	The base url of the website that is running App::CPANIDX. This is
	required.

      cmd

	The query command to send to the server. This can be mod, dists,
	auth, timestamp or topten. If no cmd is specified the component
	will default to timestamp. The first three commands require a
	search term.

      search

	The search term to use for the mod, dists, auth commands.

      See OUTPUT EVENTS below for what will be sent to your session in
      reply.

      You may also set arbitary keys to pass arbitary data along with your
      request. These must be prefixed with an underscore _.

OUTPUT EVENTS

    The component will send an event in response to query_idx. ARG0 of the
    event will be a HASHREF containing the key/values of the original
    request ( including any arbitary key/values passed ). It will also
    contain either a data key or an error key.

    data

      This will an arrayref of the data returned by the CPANIDX site. If
      there was no data to return then this will be a 'blank' arrayref.

    error

      If there was an error of some sort then data will not be defined and
      this will contain a message indicating what the problem was.
