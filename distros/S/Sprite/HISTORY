* v3.21 - April 21, 1998

Balanced quotes and regex delimiters are now handled correctly within queries.

Also fixed the following bugs:

    * Equal signs in queries caused field values to be modified
    * Regex metacharacters in 'write' delimiter were not being escaped
    * One field inserts failed
    * Mixed case SQL was ignored
    * Failed to escape "\" when writing to a file
    * One field records with a value of 0 were accidently ignored
    * Values with \"" were incorrectly converted to \\"
    * Unmatched quotes caused fatal errors

As of this version, you have better control over the error messages that
Sprite spits out. See the example for more details.

* v3.2 - March 12, 1998

TWO VERY IMPORTANT CHANGES:

    * Columns are no longer returned as a null-delimited string,
      but as an array reference. However, you have the option of
      asking Sprite to return the _records_ either as an array or
      a reference.

    * A relaxed copyright notice.

Fixed some major bugs in all aspects of parsing queries, especially
in the parse_expression method. I bet it's _almost_ bug free now :-) 
Also added the ability to specify !~ when performing queries that 
involve regular expressions. 

Added the 'add column' statement. Also added support for 8-bit
chars. in field names and also in the database path.

Added the 'set_db_dir' method, which allows you to set a default
directory where Sprite will look for database files. Please see
the documentation for more information. 

Specifying a platform with the set_os method is optional, but
recommended. Sprite determines the platform by looking at $^O.

Modified the update method so that columns are modified (or updated) 
in the order you specify. This allows you to pass queries like so:

    update my_db
    set AllStar = (AllStar + 1),
        Years   = (AllStar)
    where (Player =~ /Jordan\$/);

where the second reference to 'AllStar' reflects the updated 
(incremented) value.

In prior versions, database locking wasn't implemented properly,
causing occasional race conditions. This is fixed! In addition, 
Sprite now creates a 'loose' locking mechanism for systems that 
don't support flock, namely the Mac, Windows 95 and VMS. However, 
this mechanism is NOT fully reliable, but is better than no lock 
at all. BTW, Windows NT _does_ support flock!

Sprite is approximately 25-30% faster than previous versions when 
dealing with larger databases because the parsing and evaluation has
been optimized.

Benchmark, FWIW: Sprite processed a relatively complex query on
a 1000 record database with 6 fields on a lightly loaded Sparc 20
with 64 MB RAM in 2.3 seconds!

... and more.

* v3.1 - June 18, 1996
          
Added the following features:

    - Update multiple fields with a single update command.

    - You can now execute your scripts with 'strict' and tainting turned on.

    - For records that don't contain quotes or 'escaped' strings, _split_ 
      is used to dramatically speed up database loading.

    - The set_os function will allow you to set the O/S that you're using.

    - Added a 'require 5.002' as Sprite fails on versions of Perl older 
      than 5.002 with the following error:

          "Bad free() ignored at Sprite.pm..."

Fixed the following bugs:

    - If you call the close method with a database as an argument without 
      opening a database first, Sprite will warn you as opposed to wiping 
      out the database, as was the case in earlier versions of Sprite.

    - Sprite no longer chops off the trailing '0' on records.

    - The _drop column_ works as it should.

    - You can safely escape parentheses in the update command.

    - Extra spaces between field names in the select command and values 
      in the update command no longer cause fatal errors.

    - In earlier versions of Sprite, if you opened the databases that were
      located in different directories, but with the same name, Sprite
      incorrectly assumed that it was the same database. As a result, the 
      second database would never be loaded.

    - Can be used on the Mac OS and Windows NT.

* v3.01 - March 5, 1996

Fixed a bug in parse_expression method so that it recognizes the '_' 
character as valid in field names.

* v3.0 - Febraury 20, 1996

Totally re-wrote parser; works reasonably well even in the worst 
case scenarios.

* v2.0 - November 23, 1995

Fixed *numerous* errors in parsing, and added pod style docs.

* v1.5 - September 10, 1995

Created module to replace the command-line interface.

* v1.0 - September 7, 1995
