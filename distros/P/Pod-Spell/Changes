Revision history Pod-Spell

1.20      2016-04-22
	- Stable release, made in Rugby, UK during Perl QA Hackathon 2016

1.19_91   2016-04-21
	- Drop use of File::ShareDir::ProjectDistDir (GitHub #26). Thanks Kent
	  Fredric!
	- Allow stop words with '.' (GitHub #28). Thanks Paulo Custodio!

1.19_90   2016-02-20
	- Hide internals: the POD parser is moved to a private package and
	  the Pod::Spell package now only exposes the public interface.
	  This is a first step towards rewriting the parser using Pod::Simple
	  (planned for Pod-Spell-2.0).
	- 'parse_from_file' and 'parse_from_filehandle' are now explicitely
	  documented (by copying doc from Pod::Parser).

1.19      2016-02-20
	- Don't set $Text::Wrap::huge globally, but localize it
	- Load Pod::Wordlist only if used

1.18      2016-01-30
	- New maintainer: Olivier Mengué (DOLMEN)
	  Repo is now hosted at github.com/perl-pod/Pod-Spell
	- Fix warning in strip_stopwords (GH #23)
	- re-apply "podspell script: set output encoding from locale CTYPE"
	  (GH #22, #17). The issue in 1.16 was an incorrect dependency
	  on I18N::Langinfo.

1.17      2015-03-08
	- revert changes in 1.16 they are not compatible with windows GH #18

1.16      2015-02-24

	- change to use Path::Tiny->lines_utf8

1.14      2014-02-12

	  GH #15 ( Ether )

1.10      2013-09-27
	[FEATURES]
	- added 'no_wide_chars' option to strip words with such characters
	  from the output.  This may help spellcheckers that can't cope
	  with UTF-8
	[CHANGED]
	- improved punctuation stripping algorithm for better word
	  isolation (example C<< "hello". >> now is found as "hello")
	- strips all word that do not have at least one \w character
	  as a spellchecker isn't likely to do anything useful with them
	[DOCUMENTED]
	- added recommendations for dealing with character encoding

1.09      2013-09-25
	[FIXED]
	- stopwords with 's are learned without 's to match how they are
	  checked
	[CHANGED]
	- leading and trailing punctuation is entirely stripped since the
	  spellchecker won't care anyway.  Trailing periods are *not*
	  stripped as they might be abbreviations ("Ph.D."), but such words
	  are checked against the stoplist both with and without
	  trailing periods to account for abbreviations and words at the
	  end of a sentence.

1.08      2013-09-24
	[FIXED]
	- hyphenated word parts are also checked against the stoplist
	  and stripped (dagolden) GH #9
	[DOCUMENTED]
	- noted that stopwords must be added before words appear in Pod
