NAME
    Python::Bytecode::SAX - Process Python bytecode, generating SAX events.

SYNOPSIS
      use Python::Bytecode::SAX;
      use XML::SAX::Writer;
      my $handler = XML::SAX::Writer->new( Output => 'foo.xml' );
      my $parser = Python::Bytecode::SAX->new( Handler => $handler, SAX => 2 );
      $parser->parse_file('foo.pyc');

    Or

      use Python::Bytecode::SAX;
      use XML::Handler::YAWriter;
      my $handler = XML::Handler::YAWriter->new(
          AsFile => 'foo.xml',
          Pretty  => {
              CompactAttrIndent  => 1,
              PrettyWhiteIndent  => 1,
              PrettyWhiteNewline => 1,
              CatchEmptyElement  => 1
          }
      );
      my $parser = Python::Bytecode::SAX->new( Handler => $handler, SAX => 1 );
      $parser->parse_file('foo.pyc');

DESCRIPTION
    This module reads and decodes a Python bytecode file, generating SAX1 or
    SAX2 events (SAX1 is the default) for what it finds.

    Until more documentation is written, you can examine the two XML files
    generated in the t/ directory by "make test" to get a feel for the
    overal structure and the element and attribute names.

HISTORY
    Based on the Python::Bytecode module by Simon Cozens <simon@cpan.org>,
    which is based on the dis.py file in the Python Standard Library.
