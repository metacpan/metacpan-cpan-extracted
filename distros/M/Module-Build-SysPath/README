NAME
    Module::Build::SysPath - install files to system folders according to
    FHS (or Sys::Path settings)

SYNOPSIS
        use Module::Build::SysPath;
        my $builder = Module::Build::SysPath->new(
            ...

DESCRIPTION
    A subclass of Module::Build using Sys::Path to determine the system
    folders. Help in task of installing files into system folders and
    keeping the option to work in local distribution files while developing
    the module.

    See Acme::SysPath for example usage of a module that needs a
    configuration and a folder to store templates in.

USAGE
  module-starter
        module-starter --builder=Module::Build --module=Acme::NewModule --author="Pod" --email=pod@pod
        cd Acme-NewModule/
        perl -lane 's/Module::Build-/Module::Build::SysPath-/; print $_;' -i Build.PL 
        vim Build.PL
        # s/Module::Build-/Module::Build::SysPath-/
        # add "configure_requires => { 'Module::Build::SysPath' => 0.10 },"
        # add "Module::Build::SysPath' => 0.10," to build_requires

  create SPc.pm
    copy http://github.com/jozef/Sys-Path/blob/master/examples/SPc.pm and
    add it to your source tree. Clean up the paths that you don't need.
    Local distribution folder names can be changed to anyones taste. For
    example:

        sub sysconfdir { File::Spec->catdir(__PACKAGE__->prefix, 'conf') };

    'conf' is the name of a folder with `conffile's. All file put to this
    folder will be installed to Sys::Path->sysconfdir().

  use the SPc.pm
    Calling `Acme::NewModule::SPc->sysconfdir' before the distribution is
    installed will return path to the 'conf' folder in the distribution root
    folder. Calling it after install the distribution will return
    Sys::Path->sysconfdir().

EXAMPLE
    See Acme::SysPath for a really simple, Test::Daily for a real world
    example.

  new
    Populates:

        $builder->{'properties'}->{$path_type.'_files'} = ...;
        $builder->{'properties'}->{'install_path'}->{$path_type} = ...;
        $builder->add_build_element($path_type);

    To install files located in:

            sysconfdir
            datadir
            docdir
            localedir
            webdir
            srvdir

    Folders in:

        cachedir
        logdir
        spooldir
        rundir
        lockdir
        sharedstatedir

    are skipped during the installation. Add .exists to this folders if you
    want them to be created during `./Build install`.

    Configuration files get a special (Debian like) treatment. All files in
    `sysconfdir' and all files specified as
    `$builder->{'properties'}->{'conffiles'}' are configuration files. Using
    Sys::Path the c<conffile>s checksums are tracked. Here are the model
    situations:

    `conffile' was never installed jet
        The file is just copied in place (to sysconfdir) as it is. MD5 is
        recorded.

    distribution ships new version, no change in system
        The distribution changed the `conffile' (for example by adding new
        values), but the `conffile' was untouched in the system. Then the
        new version from distribution replaces the one in the system.

    distribution `conffile' wasn't changed, `conffile' changed in system
        Already installed distribution is getting upgrade. Distribution
        `conffile's form installed and the new version didn't change. But
        the `conffile' was changed in the system. No prompt and the
        `conffile' is kept intact.

    distribution `conffile' change, `conffile' changed in system
        Already installed distribution is getting upgrade. When both the
        distribution changed the `conffile' and the `conffile' was changed
        in the system. User will be prompted what to do:

            Installing new version of config file /etc/SOMEFILE ...
    
            Configuration file `/etc/SOMEFILE'
             ==> Modified (by you or by a script) since installation.
             ==> Package distributor has shipped an updated version.
               What would you like to do about it ?  Your options are:
                Y or I  : install the package maintainer's version
                N or O  : keep your currently-installed version
                  D     : show the differences between the versions
                  Z     : background this process to examine the situation
             The default action is to keep your current version.
    
            *** /etc/SOMEFILE (Y/I/N/O/D/Z) ?

        If N or O is selected distribution files is installed with -spc
        suffix. If Y or I is selected the system `conffile' is renamed by
        adding suffix -old and distribution `conffile' is installed.

  ACTION_install
    This action is responsible for renaming files, replacing SPc.pm paths to
    systems once from Sys::Path. Also makes files writable (chmod 0644). And
    stores the checksums of `conffile's.
