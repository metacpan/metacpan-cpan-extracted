	Adoption.

0.03	27 June 2002
	Oops.  Object creation only allows one object per interpreter.  Fixed.

	Forgot to update VERSION.  It now correctly shows 0.03.

0.02	26 June 2002
	Adapted test so that too long lines are now also tested for.

	Removed FLUSH().  Not necessary anymore as everything is written
	immediately.

	Changed WRITE so that it writes to the handle immediately rather than
	adding to the buffer in the object.

	Changed PUSHED so that the object is just something to hang the methods
	on.

	Removed superfluous -package- from pod.

	Emptied TODO: there was some garbage there from another project.

0.01	25 June 2002
	Initial release of IOLayer::QuotedPrint.
