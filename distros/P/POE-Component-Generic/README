POE::Component::Generic is POE component that provides non-blocking access
to a blocking object. 

It works by forking of a sub-process with POE::Wheel::Run to do the work The
blocking object is created in the child process, which waits for method
calls from the parent.

It is intended for people who want to use an object that blocks from
POE with as little pain as possible.


NOTE: It has come to our attention that POE::Component::Generic does not
always function correctly on Windows.  We do not have the skills nor the
time to debug this issue.  We would be very pleased if you would solve this
for us.


POE::Component::Generic can be installed the usual ways:

Through the CPAN shell:

	perl -MCPAN -e 'install "POE::Component::Generic"'

Or by downloading it and running the usual commands:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make test
	make install

It is possible to configure some of the test cases by passing arguments to
Makefile.PL.

    perl Makefile.PL --help
