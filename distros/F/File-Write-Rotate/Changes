0.320   2019-06-27 (PERLANCAR)

	- Add a no-op flush().


0.31    2016-10-07 (PERLANCAR)

        - Document binmode option [GH#12] [GH#13].

        - Remove usage of Carp to shave a bit off startup overhead.

        - Delay loading Proc::PID::File a bit more.


0.30    2016-06-06 (PERLANCAR)

        - No functional changes.

        - Replace inchworm operator with plain 'scalar', causes error in 5.24+
          [RT#115088] (ref: RT#111786).


0.29    2015-10-20 (PERLANCAR)

	- No functional changes.

	- To reduce deps, remove runtime use of Taint::Runtime.


0.28    2015-01-26 (PERLANCAR)

        - Now check argument to new(), unknown arguments will croak.

        - Add option: rotate_probability, to increase writing speed by only
          doing rotate checks probabilistically, at the consequence of writes
          "spilling" for a bit.


0.27    2015-01-23 (PERLANCAR)

        - No functional changes.

        - [Bugfix] Fix compression when logging dir is not the current directory
          (Jonathan G. Rennison).


0.26    2015-01-22 (PERLANCAR)

        - Add option: lock_mode (can be set to 'write' [the default] or
          'none'/'exclusive'). Setting this option to 'none'/'exclusive' can
          increase write performance, but setting to 'none' means disabling
          locking and should be done if you expect only one writer, and setting
          to 'exclusive' means holding the lock for a long time. (Thanks
          Jonathan G. Rennison).


0.25    2014-12-05 (PERLANCAR)

	- No functional changes.

	- Use new name of renamed module SHARYANTO::File::Flock ->
	  File::Flock::Retry.


0.24    2014-12-05 (PERLANCAR)

        - These changes are done by TOSHIOITO++.

	[BUG FIXES]

        - Make sure lock is released even when write() or some hook dies.

        - Fix rotation, rotation by period previously never delete old files.

        [INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES]

        - compress() method now avoids compressing files with the latest period.
          Before, this method avoided compressing files with the period of
          "_cur_period" private attribute, which was set by _open(). However,
          "_cur_period" was not set if compress() was called without calling
          write() beforehand. The new behavior is a little different from the
          old, but it's the same in most cases.


0.23    2014-11-09 (PERLANCAR)

	- compress() now unlinks uncompressed originals (this is the
	  original behavior before switching from using gzip utility to
	  IO::Compress::Gzip).


0.22    2014-09-01 (PERLANCAR)

        - No functional changes.

        - POD fixes.


0.21    2014-09-01 (PERLANCAR)

        - Introduce hooks (currently:
          hook_{before_write,after_create,before_rotate,after_rotate}).

        - Add (ro) attribute methods: handle(), path().


0.20    2014-08-22 (SHARYANTO)

        - Bug fix: Set timezone when testing, otherwise in UTC+12 (e.g.
          Auckland) there is change of day [CT].


0.19    2014-08-20 (SHARYANTO)

        - Fix bug in file_path() which caused current period log file to be
          compressed [problem reported by Alceu Rodrigues de Freitas Junior].


0.18    2014-08-16 (SHARYANTO) - Happy 19th CPAN Day!

        [ENHANCEMENTS]

        - Replace the use of 'gzip' binary with IO::Compress::Gzip, to allow
          this module to run in OS's other than Unix-like ones [Alceu Rodrigues
          de Freitas Junior].

        - Add tests for compression.

        [BUG FIXES]

        - Old period logs were never compressed.


0.17    2014-07-10 (SHARYANTO)

        - Fix dep version (Test::Warnings 0.014, not 0.14).


0.16    2014-07-10 (SHARYANTO)

        - Added support for 'binmode' (to set PerlIO layers, esp. encoding)
          [thanks Norbert Buchmuller].


0.15    2014-05-17 (SHARYANTO)

        - No functional changes.

        - Replace File::Slurp with File::Slurp::Tiny.


0.14    2013-07-03 (SHARYANTO)

        - No functional changes. Force fixed SHARYANTO::File::Flock version
          (0.49).


0.13    2013-04-12 (SHARYANTO)

        - No functional changes. Add FAQ item on why use FWR and the downside.


0.12    2013-04-12 (SHARYANTO)

        - No functional changes. Update module name in POD and expand the
          explanation on the difference between FWR & LDFR.


0.11    2012-12-28 (SHARYANTO)

        - No functional changes. Tweak error message.


0.10    2012-12-28 (SHARYANTO)

        [NEW FEATURES]

        - Add buffering (attribute: buffer_size) to buffer messages during
          temporary write() failure.


0.09    2012-12-28 (SHARYANTO)

        - Make rotate pass under taint-mode.


0.08    2012-12-28 (SHARYANTO)

        [BUG FIXES]

        - Can now rotate on the first write() instead of on the second and
          subsequent.


0.07    2012-12-27 (SHARYANTO)

        - Avoid using Log::Any, because we are used as backend for
          Log::Dispatch::FileWriteRotate (thus, a loop).


0.06    2012-12-27 (SHARYANTO)

        - Set autoflush (to pass Log-Any-App09 tests).


0.05    2012-12-26 (SHARYANTO)

        - No functional changes. Mention 'period' argument in POD.


0.04    2012-12-26 (SHARYANTO)

        - A small fix in DESTROY().


0.03    2012-12-25 (SHARYANTO)

        - No functional changes. Extract flocking routines to
          SHARYANTO::File::Flock.


0.02    2012-12-22 (SHARYANTO)

        - No functional changes. Additions/corrections for POD.
