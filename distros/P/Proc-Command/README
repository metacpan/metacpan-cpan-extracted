1.0 SCOPE
    This paragraph identifies and provides an overview of the released
    files.

  1.1 Identification
    This release, identified in 3.2, is a collection of Perl modules that
    extend the capabilities of the Perl language.

  1.2 System overview
    The "Proc::Command" module extends the Perl language (the system).

    Some Perls under Microsoft windows suffers disabilities over Unix Perls.
    One particular disability is a backtick without the console. Altough the
    Microsoft console, may be started without a window (start command with
    /b option or spawn program call), the Perl system command on windows
    usually create a window. Creating a window causes immense user interface
    problem since it will randomly pop-up and take focus over the current
    window, erasing current entries into that window. Solutions such as
    "Proc::SafePipe" do not run on Perls for Window.

    This module provides an answer by using the "open" command with a pipe
    to provide a backtick without a console that will run under Perls on
    Microsoft Windows.

  1.3 Document overview.
    This document releases Proc::Command version 0.04 providing a
    description of the inventory, installation instructions and other
    information necessary to utilize and track this release.

  3.3 Changes
    Changes are as follows:

    Proc-Command-0.01
        Originated

    Proc-Command-0.02
        Added a statement to support the VSM platform

        $command = "MCR $command" if $^O eq 'VMS';

    Proc-Command-0.03
        Added a 1 at the end of the code section. Unix Perls very strict on
        this one.

    Proc-Command-0.04
        Change the test so that test support program modules resides in
        distribution directory tlib directory instead of the lib directory.
        Because they are no longer in the lib directory, test support files
        will not be installed as a pre-condition for the test of this
        module. The test of this module will precede immediately. The test
        support files in the tlib directory will vanish after the
        installtion.

  3.4 Adaptation data.
    This installation requires that the installation site has the Perl
    programming language installed. There are no other additional
    requirements or tailoring needed of configurations files, adaptation
    data or other software needed for this installation particular to any
    installation site.

  3.5 Related documents.
    There are no related documents needed for the installation and test of
    this release.

  3.6 Installation instructions.
    Instructions for installation, installation tests and installation
    support are as follows:

  3.7 Possible problems and known errors
    There is still much work needed to ensure the quality of this module as
    follows:

    *   State the functional requirements for each method including not only
        the GO paths but also what to expect for the NOGO paths

    *   All the tests are GO path tests. Should add NOGO tests.

    *   Add the requirements addressed as *# R: * comment to the tests

    *   Write a program to build a matrix to trace test step to the
        requirements and vice versa by parsing the *# R: * comments.
        Automatically insert the matrix in the Test::TestUtil POD.
