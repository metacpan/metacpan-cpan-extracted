version 2.006; 2011-05-07

  * implement AUTODIN-II CRC hashing, delegating to Digest::CRC to
    perform the actual CRC calculation

  * in documentation, refer to the VMS function principally as
    "SYS$HASH_PASWORD" (which seems to be its primary name) and only
    secondarily as "LGI$HPWD"

  * in XS, use save stack to clean up temporarily allocated memory

  * in XS, declare "PROTOTYPES: DISABLE" to prevent automatic generation
    of unintended prototypes

  * in t/setup_pp.pl, avoid a warning that occurs if XSLoader::load()
    is given no arguments, which is now a valid usage

  * slightly reformat some C code to avoid exceeding 80 columns

  * include META.json in distribution

  * add MYMETA.json to .cvsignore

version 2.005; 2010-07-30

  * in XS, use the correct "PREINIT:" instead of "INIT:" to introduce
    variable declarations

  * in XS, use PERL_NO_GET_CONTEXT for efficiency

  * use simpler "parent" pragma in place of "base"

  * check for required Perl version at runtime

  * use full stricture in test suite

  * also test POD coverage of pure Perl implementation

  * correct spelling of "build_recommends" in Build.PL

  * in Build.PL, explicitly set needs_compiler to avoid bogus
    auto-dependency on ExtUtils::CBuilder

  * in Build.PL, explicitly declare configure-time requirements

  * remove bogus "exit 0" from Build.PL

  * add MYMETA.yml to .cvsignore

version 2.004; 2009-03-15

  * add a (hideously slow) pure Perl backup implementation for systems
    that can't handle XS modules

  * comprehensive UTF-8 tests, with non-ASCII test vectors, testing all
    vectors both downgraded and upgraded, in a way that also works on
    perl v5.6

  * add casts for pointer target signedness, and other small changes to
    the C code, to avoid compiler warnings

  * small POD markup changes

version 2.003; 2009-03-02

  * bugfix: avoid memory leak when croaking

  * bugfix: ensure appropriate alignment of qword struct for 64-bit
    arithmetic on strict-alignment 64-bit systems

  * add backward-compatibility definition of bytes_from_utf8() function

  * disable, pending further analysis, assembler versions of the code that
    have been observed to result in compilation failures on some systems

  * remove ununsed dword_t and qword_t structs from the C code

  * use full stricture in Build.PL

version 2.002; 2007-09-17

  * bugfix: correctly handle UTF8-encoded scalars

  * don't use ppport.h, because it wasn't doing anything for perl v5.6+

  * test POD syntax and coverage

  * build with Module::Build instead of ExtUtils::MakeMaker

  * rearrange source tree to fit Module::Build convention

  * complete dependency list

  * include signature in distribution

  * in documentation, separate "license" section from "copyright" section

version 2.001; 2006-08-30

  * add vms_username() and vms_password() functions for syntax checking
    and canonicalisation

version 2.0; 2006-08-27

  * rewrite by Zefram: based on a newer branch of Shawn Clifford's C
    code; proper Perlish error handling; allow arbitrary byte strings
    (including embedded NULs); new documentation; many test vectors

version 1.0; 2003-09-11

  * original version by <mikem@open.com.au>
