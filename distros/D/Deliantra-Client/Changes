2.11 Sat Apr 24 10:08:34 CEST 2010
	- support overriding the audio driver at runtime, for folks who know
          what they are doing.
	- upgrade to libSDL 1.2.14/SDL_mixer 1.2.11 for the GNU/Linux and
          windows binaries, and also compile in multiple drivers (pulseaudio
          disabled currently because it's too sucky and crashes on probe).
	- replace level by minimum level, and damage by effective casting level
          (for servers > 2.93).
	- added some commandline arguments: <host> <user> <password>,
          for the developers mostly.
	- try a different method of avoiding music-related crashes.
        - cfplus editor support protocol fixes.
        - apply some common::sense 3.1 :)
        - implement bandwidth-usage debug option.
        - renamed env variable CFPLUS_DEBUG to DELIANTRA_DEBUG.
        - display audio driver name that is in use.
        - try to show splashscreen earlier.

2.10 Fri Jan 15 16:14:02 CET 2010
	- fix blending factors to avoid white-out when fow_intensity > 0.

2.09 Tue Dec 22 01:40:24 CET 2009
	- implement smooth fow/lighting transitions by blending.
        - make fow texture configurable and add stipple/transparent versions.
	- empty "Host" field will now default to gameserver.deliantra.net.
        - do not crash when the user enters an invalid value into "Host".
	- fix positional rounding on (pre-c99) windows.
        - use a pack/unpack alignment of 1 by default everywhere, drop alignment
          code in fow_texture.

2.06 Fri Dec  4 15:35:33 CET 2009
	- work around the Apple/NVIDIA font problem (a bug in glTexSubImage2D that
          apple has no intention to fix, so we do the slow read/update/write way).
        - work around various ATI/Mesa driver bugs in glTexImage2D by always
          providing initialisation data for textures. Do they ever test their drivers
          with, say, some newbie opengl code?
	- stat change messages did not differentiate between attuned, repelled etc.
        - work around a bug in the nvidia driver which mishandles alpha textures
          with env mode REPLACE, causing all magic maps to be white only.
        - do not use mipmapping for tiles - the trade-off was not worth it.
        - fix packaging the pango modules twice in the linux and windows binaries.

(2.05) Tue Sep 29 11:21:00 CEST 2009
	- intermediate os x binary release only.
	- linking against the opengl library works everywhere, except on Mac OS X 10.6,
          which some people even spent money on (this seems to break a great number
          of opengl apps actually).
        - (os x binary) update libsdl to 1.2.14.

2.05 Tue Sep 15 20:31:15 CEST 2009
	- changed completer algorithm, thanks go to marcmagus!
	- try to work around crashes in SDL_Mixer when reinitialising it.

2.04 Sun Apr 26 21:03:40 CEST 2009
	- work around incompatible ABI change between 1.22 and 1.24 by using a runtime check,
          this really is a bug that needs fixing inside pango.
        - include a japanese font (Mona, selected for license and size) with the distribution.
        - include our own fonts.conf file, to speed up startup and to be able to control
          font selection.
	- change confusing login successful message to "connect to server successful".
        - update BDB and EV in win32 builds to work around the event loop creation bug.
        - fall back to blocking dns resolve before using a hardcoded address.

2.03 Tue Jan 20 14:54:30 CET 2009
	- move experience label, progress bars and slot info to the menubar.
        - move toplevel menu into a menu popup.
        - use fontsize for chekcbox size requests to get a better layout.
        - autopickup spellbooks, skillscrolls and valuables by default.
	- automatically save config/layout on exit and add config options
          to Setup=>Client to control this.
        - fix positioning of popup windows.
        - move autopickup enable (formerly inhibit) to menubar.
        - correctly display face changes for inventory objects.
   	- verify databases if we are the first process to register, to
          detect corruption as is common on windows (but not limited to
          windows, unfortunately).
        - fall back to backup config file if main config file cannot be parsed.
        - reduce shimmering during smooth scrolls.
        - rely on AnyEvent to work around totally broken windows vista
          tcp/ip subsystem once more (where getpeername returns fantasy
          ports).
        - use newer BDB version that works around windows vista tcp/ip
          breakage.
        - initialise the default resolver during startup, as windows vista
          forces us back to the desktop when doing this later(!).

2.02 Wed Dec 24 06:02:53 CET 2008
   	- mark hidden mapspaces visually with a question mark.
        - make hidden spaces as light as the darkest normal spaces.
	- don't lie about the window size anymore in fear of crashing
          the server (as we are dealing with deliantra servers only these days).
        - correctly draw the speech bubbles and other overlays even when the
          topmost face isn't visible.
	- fix swirly tile draw offset.
        - fix a crash when the user clicks on the map during log-in.
        - incorporate tips of the day by botz (former madness).
        - handle failure to load a music face more gracefully (still
          log the error, but do not crash, instead, ignore the failure).
        - try to log, instead of crash, on the "cannot call update method"
          problem.

2.01 - (Mon Dec 15 00:41:33 CET 2008)
        - rewrote the client tutorial which can be found via the 'Help!' button.
        - fixed the mostly random switching of message window tabs when
          new tabs were added.
        - small typo fix in tooltip on the Skills page in the playerbook.
        - avoid accessing potentially undefined memory when drawing the map.
        - fixed speech bubbles which were drawn below some objects sometimes.

2.0  Fri Dec  5 15:42:51 CET 2008
        - the Log window can't be close anymore by alt+x
        - pressing return or alt+x directly after start won't crash the client
          anymore.
        - the Log window is displayed correctly now after start.
        - darken the invisible/cached parts of the map further.

0.9978 Sun Nov  9 14:35:41 CET 2008
	- correctly smooth-move the healthbar as well.
        - own text is emphasized in the NPC dialogues now.
        - fixed a crash bug in the macro dialogue.
        - fixed updating of tooltips of the tabs in the message window.
        - closing tabs with Alt-x won't let them disappear for every anymore.

0.9977 Tue Sep 30 09:27:29 CEST 2008
	- require newer BDB version to avoid possible database corruption or crashes
          on login.
	- fixed the often choppy smooth movement.
	- switch to proportional font in log view.
        - improve the paragraph indent hack to align characters better.
        - tweak server message output.
        - optimise visibility handing in multiplexers (only put the current tab
          into visible state).
        - reduce the number of unnecessary refreshes.
        - allow empty multiplexers.
        - fixed clearing issue in the inventory upon logout.
        - use the same workarounds for pango for gnu/linux binaries as we use for osx,
          but additionally patch the pango library because stupid braindead idiotic
          debian maintainers of course apply custom patches that completely break it.

0.9976 Fri Sep  5 17:28:30 CEST 2008
	- use keysym not unicode symbol, maybe that helps with some of those keyboard
          issues on OS X.
        - treat meta like alt for built-ins, for OS X.
        - fix tab tooltip listing key shortcut off by one.
        - disable texture compression with apple software renderer. if you want to get
          something that works, apple is for you. not.
        - fix text encoding for item description tooltips.
        - enlarge window borders considerably.
        - support lzf-compressed packets.
        - support fragmented packets.
        - send crash and opengl vendor information to server for better debugging.
        - fix crash when displaying the tutorial with the precompiled os x
          binary: libjpeg collided with libJPEG - long live case-insensitivity :/
        - cater for the incompatible changes in berkeley db 4.7.
        - enable highest-resolution video mode again.
        - add some preliminary theme support and two demo themes, "plain" and "blue".
        - avoid a crash when the minimap is reduced to zero size.
        - work around a bug in perl 5.8 perls (Bareword "Socket::AF_UNIX"...).

0.9975 Wed Aug 27 22:16:27 CEST 2008
	- use biggest video mode <= 1024x768 by default now (previous releases had a bug
          that caused them to select the smallest vdieo mode available).
	- ported to the rather horridly broken apple os x platform,
          using macports (the only non-broken part of the whole thing).
	- clarify/fix weight/value autopickup option with a tooltip and a server change.

0.9974 Fri Aug  1 15:45:59 CEST 2008
	- implement smooth scrolling for the player.
	- try a different workaround to maybe register Deliantra::Client.
        - support switching off of alpha framebuffers, to work around
          possible fallback-to-software-renderer problems.
        - allow video modes <800x600 to be selectable.
        - decode player from map1ax.
	- made libsdl1.2.10+ a requirement.
        - improve the slider widget.
	- use AnyEvent::Socket::parse_hostport.
        - upgrade to BDB 1.7.
        - properly clear mapcells in all cases, also try a heuristic to avoid
          player ghost images.

0.9973 Mon Jul  7 09:27:59 CEST 2008
	- added a dummy "package Deliantra::Client" to bin/deliantra, as
          cpan stupidly cannot install distributions by name.
	- convert to new non-blocking API.
        - support IPv6 server connections.
        - the chat tabs now have tooltips again.

0.9972 Thu May 22 22:45:01 CEST 2008
	- save all map changes in map cache, not just the current map (this fixes
          the problem of map border "black out" in the minimap).
        - use an even more compact format for minimap data.
        - use an uncompressed cache for minimap data, increases memory requirements
          (~1mb) but saves compression.
	- close container, clear inventory, floorbox etc. to avoid a crash when
          clicking on them after logging out.
	- support xml formatting in ex replies (item tooltips, requires server
          2.54+).
	- try to ignore repeated keypress-events for movement, as
          these are usually keyrepeats.
	- added default (0) for the shift_fire_stop setting
	- write client.cf in pretty-printed-json.
        - avoid crashes if map cache is corrupted.

0.9971 Mon May  5 21:37:33 CEST 2008
	- reverse order of items in floorbox.
	- sort right side of inventory by floor order.
        - make messages window always visible.
	- fix stat tooltips by not lowercasing keywords in pod2wiki.
	- fix longstanding bug where the stats tab would be removed during chargen.
        - fix menu alignment.
	- change podwiki format to be slightly more generic.
	- ignore pseudo-items in floorbox, only show in inventory.

0.9970 Sun Mar 30 13:30:47 CEST 2008
	- fix a bug in tile id allocation, the effect of this bug
          was effectively disabling the tile cache, upgrade is highly
          recommended.
        - fix npc dialog.
	- upgrade the database schema (i.e. nuke it...).
	- only open the database before forking the bg server.
        - PRECOMPILED BINARY: use packaged libdb4.6 instead of libdb4.4.
        - use newer BDB module (might fix the filename encoding issue under win32).
        - use a real bdb sequence for the faceid, for better performance.

0.9968 Tue Mar 25 20:28:16 CET 2008
	- reduce documentation memory usage.
        - fix the stat gauge tooltips that have gone missing since 0.9966.

0.9967 Mon Mar 24 01:24:07 CET 2008
	- implement keyboard modifier display (mostly because of the numlock
          problems under windows).
        - work around a bug on windows where the layout font is being ignored.

0.9966 Sat Mar 22 14:26:05 CET 2008
	- when the message window is hidden and the input is activated, it will
          become visible again.
	- the max number of paragraphs in the chattabs were not limited,
          leading to a naughty memory leak
	- the highlighting of the chattabs were deep blue where they should have been
          deep red :-)
	- fixed a small inconvenience in the history handling of chat tab entries
          (hitting cursor-up or cursor-down won't erase what you typed by accident
          anymore).

0.9965 Sat Jan 19 05:51:39 CET 2008
	- work around a database race condition by using single-threaded
          database access.

0.9964 Fri Jan 18 06:30:13 CET 2008
        - fixed a bug where the message fontsize wasn't set correctly
        - do not call glTexSubimage2D on 0x0 bitmaps, as this
          crashes newer nvidia drivers.
        - fix chatbox label padding.
	- further rename database directory.
	- further "branding" of cfplus => deliantra.

0.9963 Sun Jan  6 18:27:02 CET 2008
	- rework of the messsage window to support 'undocked' windows.
	- ignore keyboard modifiers we are never interested in.
	- improve interactivity by using a prepare, not an idle watcher,
          for screen refreshes.
        - limit the time spent in database handling, so we refresh the screen
          even during ongoing heavy texture loading.
        - load tile map at startup, not at connect time.
        - tweak database accesses.
        - widget protocol version 2, supports ui templates.
        - increase horizontal padding for buttons a bit.
        - preallocate texture name when switching video modes and the
          texture can only be loaded in the background to avoid
          something else taking over.
        - increase padding for all text entries.
        - work around a bugfix in pango that no longer is necessary
          (but causes a bug with new pango versions, argh.)
	- use supposedly faster readonly pango functions wherever possible.
        - Canvas widget properly restores line and point widths.
        - fix padding calculation.
        - change semantics for align/valign in labels to behave like other
          alignment values.

0.9962 Thu Dec 27 14:29:02 CET 2007 (download.com only)
	- changed minimum required resolution to 800x640.
	- renamed perl module to Deliantra::Client.
	- fixed unneccessary repetition when firing in a direction
          when 'only shift-up stops fire' is off.
	- do not render some glyphs twice. doh.
        - fix two problems that would cause endless
          refreshes even when idle (up to 60Hz).
        - optimise refresh strategy to not refresh more often than 60hz,
          even if it means to delay updates up to 1/60th of a second.
        - updated the dejavu fonts to version 2.22.
        - switch from Crossfire to Deliantra module.
        - switch from ~/.crossfire to ~/.deliantra,
          move database from cf to deliantra at startup.
        - fix some opengl races that could freeze deliantra during shutdowns.
        - moved client-specific modules into a private subdirectory.
        - moved client-specific resources into a private subdirectory.

0.9961 Tue Dec 25 20:22:51 CET 2007
	- fix texture-reload problems when changing resolutions
          by forcing the reuse of the same texture name.
        - save and restore glyph cache textures when changing resolutions.

0.9960 Tue Dec 25 10:38:17 CET 2007
	- fixed item animation by taking advantage of ev_periodic.
	- document KP+ better.
        - update to EV 2.0.
        - do not crash when an invisible widget wants its global
          coordinate or vice versa.

	- switch to new JSON::XS 2.01 API.
        - add some debugging hooks.

0.9956 Tue Nov 27 10:45:35 CET 2007
	- convert to the high-performance EV event loop, expecting
          higher performance and compatibility under windows.
	- the serverlist feature has been disabled due to problems
          with activestate perl.

0.9955 Sat Nov  3 13:07:57 CET 2007
	- enable fullscreen by default.
        - use a minimum mode of 800x600.
