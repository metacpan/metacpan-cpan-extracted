Revision history for Perl extension POE::Component::Server::SimpleHTTP.

Switched to new Changes log from SVN

* 1.16

	Kwalitee fixes.

* 1.15	

	Changed SSLify to require instead of use.

* 1.14

	Changed the defaults for the Prefork and SSLify to 'no'. 
	Applied streaming support patches from eriam.
	Converted Makefile.PL to Module::Install.

* 1.13

	learned about the difference between ref $self and ref( $self )
	Kwalitee-related fixes

* 1.12

	Finally use a Changes file - thanks RT #18981
	Added some debug stuff
	Cleanup of POD files
	Fixed a long-standing bug of closing requests if they sent a EOF
	Removed the PreFork test ( cannot disable if told installer to not install it! )

* 1.11

	Fixed the bug where no HEADERS resulted in a explosion, thanks BinGOs!
	PreForking added, look at SimpleHTTP::PreFork, thanks Stephen!

* 1.10

	Rearranged some DEBUG printouts
	Added some more 'return 1;' for POEization
	Fixed STOPLISTEN/STARTLISTEN error
	Added experimental SSL support via PoCo::SSLify

* 1.09

	Fixed a small bug regarding the timing of SHUTDOWN GRACEFUL
	I always forget to supply the session parameter to $kernel->call() :X

* 1.08

	Made the SHUTDOWN event more smarter with the 'GRACEFUL' argument
	Added the STARTLISTEN event to complement the STOPLISTEN event
	Caught a minor bug -> If the client closed the socket and SimpleHTTP got an socket error, it will delete the wheel, resulting in confusion when we get the DONE/CLOSE event
	Added $response->connection->dead boolean argument to check for the presence of a dead client
	Re-jigging of internals ;)
	Documented the only way to leak memory in SimpleHTTP ( hopefully heh )
	Added the end-run leak checking to bite programmers that discard SimpleHTTP::Response objects :-)

	I am considering putting SimpleHTTP::Response, HTTP::Request, SimpleHTTP::Connection into one super-object, called SimpleHTTP::Request
	This object will have the HTTP::Request, HTTP::Response, SimpleHTTP::Connection objects hanging off it:
		$client->request()	# HTTP::Request
		$client->response()	# HTTP::Response
		$client->connection()	# SimpleHTTP::Connection

	If I get enough ayes from people, I will go ahead and implement this change for a cleaner design.
	E-MAIL me your opinion or it will be ignored :)

* 1.07

	Added the STOPLISTEN event, to make it shutdown the listening socket to help larger programs shutdown cleanly
	Removed the CHANGES file, as it is redundant :)
	Added "return 1;" everywhere I could to avoid the nasty copy-on-exit POE bug squashed in 1.05

* 1.06

	Fixed SHUTDOWN to cleanly kill sockets, checking for definedness first
	Fixed new() to remove options that exist, but is undef -> results in croaking when DEBUG is on
	Added the CLOSE event to kill sockets without sending any output

* 1.05

	Got rid of POE::Component::Server::TCP and replaced it with POE::Wheel::SocketFactory for speed/efficiency
	As the documentation for POE::Filter::HTTPD says, updated POD to reflect the HTTP::Request/Response issue
	Got rid of SimpleHTTP::Request, due to moving of the Connection object to Response
		->	Found a circular leak by having SimpleHTTP::Connection in SimpleHTTP::Request, to get rid of it, moved it to Response
		->	Realized that sometimes HTTP::Request will be undef, so how would you get the Connection object?
	Internal tweaking to save some memory
	Added the MAX_RETRIES subroutine
	More extensive DEBUG statements
	POD updates
	Paul Visscher tracked down the HTTP::Request object leak, thanks!
	Cleaned up the Makefile.PL
	Benchmarked and found a significant speed difference between post()ing and call()ing the DONE event
		-> The call() method is ~8% faster
		-> However, the chance of connecting sockets timing out is greater...

* 1.04

	Fixed a bug reported by Tim Wood about socket disappearing
	Fixed *another* bug in the Connection object, pesky CaPs! ( Again, reported by Tim Wood )

* 1.03

	Added the GETHANDLERS/SETHANDLERS event
	POD updates
	Fixed SimpleHTTP::Connection to get rid of the funky CaPs

* 1.02

	Small fix regarding the Got_Error routine for Wheel::ReadWrite

* 1.01

	Initial Revision
