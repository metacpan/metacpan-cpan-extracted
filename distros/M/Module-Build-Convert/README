NAME
    Module::Build::Convert - Makefile.PL to Build.PL converter

SYNOPSIS
     use Module::Build::Convert;

     # example arguments (empty %args is sufficient too)
     %args = (Path => '/path/to/perl/distribution(s)',
              Verbose => 2,
              Use_Native_Order => 1,
              Len_Indent => 4);

     $make = Module::Build::Convert->new(%args);
     $make->convert;

DESCRIPTION
    "ExtUtils::MakeMaker" has been a de-facto standard for the common
    distribution of Perl modules; "Module::Build" is expected to supersede
    "ExtUtils::MakeMaker" in some time (part of the Perl core as of 5.9.4).

    The transition takes place slowly, as the converting process manually
    achieved is yet an uncommon practice. The Module::Build::Convert
    Makefile.PL parser is intended to ease the transition process.

CONSTRUCTOR
  new
    Options:

    * "Path"
        Path to a Perl distribution. May point to a single distribution
        directory or to one containing more than one distribution. Default:
        ''

    * "Makefile_PL"
        Filename of the Makefile script. Default: Makefile.PL

    * "Build_PL"
        Filename of the Build script. Default: Build.PL

    * "MANIFEST"
        Filename of the MANIFEST file. Default: MANIFEST

    * "RC"
        Filename of the RC file. Default: .make2buildrc

    * "Dont_Overwrite_Auto"
        If a Build.PL already exists, output a notification and ask whether
        it should be overwritten. Default: 1

    * "Create_RC"
        Create a RC file in the homedir of the current user. Default: 0

    * "Parse_PPI"
        Parse the Makefile.PL in the PPI Parser mode. Default: 0

    * "Exec_Makefile"
        Execute the Makefile.PL via 'do Makefile.PL'. Default: 0

    * "Verbose"
        Verbose mode. If set to 1, overridden defaults and skipped arguments
        are printed while converting; if set to 2, output of "Verbose = 1"
        and created Build script will be printed. May be set via the
        make2build switches "-v" (mode 1) and "-vv" (mode 2). Default: 0

    * "Debug"
        Rudimentary debug facility for examining the parsing process.
        Default: 0

    * "Process_Code"
        Process code embedded within the arguments list. Default: 0

    * "Use_Native_Order"
        Native sorting order. If set to 1, the native sorting order of the
        Makefile arguments will be tried to preserve; it's equal to using
        the make2build switch "-n". Default: 0

    * "Len_Indent"
        Indentation (character width). May be set via the make2build switch
        "-l". Default: 3

    * "DD_Indent"
        "Data::Dumper" indendation mode. Mode 0 will be disregarded in favor
        of 2. Default: 2

    * "DD_Sortkeys"
        "Data::Dumper" sort keys. Default: 1

METHODS
  convert
    Parses the Makefile.PL's "WriteMakefile()" arguments and converts them
    to "Module::Build" equivalents; subsequently the according Build.PL is
    created. Takes no arguments.

DATA SECTION
  Argument conversion
    "ExtUtils::MakeMaker" arguments followed by their "Module::Build"
    equivalents. Converted data structures preserve their native structure,
    that is, "HASH" -> "HASH", etc.

  Default arguments
    "Module::Build" default arguments may be specified as key/value pairs.
    Arguments attached to multidimensional structures are unsupported.

     #build_requires       HASH
     #recommends           HASH
     #conflicts            HASH
     license               unknown
     create_readme         1
     create_makefile_pl    traditional

    Value may be either a string or of type "SCALAR, ARRAY, HASH".

  Sorting order
    "Module::Build" arguments are sorted as enlisted herein. Additional
    arguments, that don't occur herein, are lower prioritized and will be
    inserted in unsorted order after preceedingly sorted arguments.

  Begin code
    Code that preceeds converted "Module::Build" arguments.

     use strict;
     use warnings;

     use Module::Build;

     $MAKECODE

     my $b = Module::Build->new
     $INDENT(

  End code
    Code that follows converted "Module::Build" arguments.

     $INDENT);

     $b->create_build_script;

     $MAKECODE

INTERNALS
  co-opting "WriteMakefile()"
    This behavior is no longer the default way to receive WriteMakefile()'s
    arguments; the Makefile.PL is now statically parsed unless one forces
    manually the co-opting of WriteMakefile().

    In order to convert arguments, a typeglob from "WriteMakefile()" to an
    internal sub will be set; subsequently Makefile.PL will be executed and
    the arguments are then accessible to the internal sub.

  Data::Dumper
    Converted "ExtUtils::MakeMaker" arguments will be dumped by
    "Data::Dumper's" "Dump()" and are then furtherly processed.

BUGS & CAVEATS
    "Module::Build::Convert" should be considered experimental as the
    parsing of the Makefile.PL doesn't necessarily return valid arguments,
    especially for Makefiles with bad or even worse, missing intendation.

    The parsing process may sometimes hang with or without warnings in such
    cases. Debugging by using the appropriate option/switch (see
    CONSTRUCTOR/new) may reveal the root cause.
