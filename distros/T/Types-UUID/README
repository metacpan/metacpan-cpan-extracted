NAME
    Types::UUID - type constraints for UUIDs

SYNOPSIS
       package FroobleStick;
   
       use Moo;
       use Types::UUID;
   
       has identifier => (
          is      => 'lazy',
          isa     => Uuid,
          coerce  => 1,
          builder => Uuid->generator,
       );

DESCRIPTION
    Types::UUID is a type constraint library suitable for use with Moo/Moose
    attributes, Kavorka sub signatures, and so forth.

  Type
    Currently the module only provides one type constraint, which is exported
    by default.

    `Uuid`
        A valid UUID string, as judged by the `is_uuid_string()` function
        provided by UUID::Tiny.

        This constraint has coercions from `Undef` (generates a new UUID),
        `Str` (fixes slightly broken-looking UUIDs, adding missing dashes;
        also accepts base-64-encoded UUIDs) and URI objects using the
        `urn:uuid:` URI scheme.

  Methods
    The `Uuid` type constraint is actually blessed into a subclass of
    Type::Tiny, and provides an aditional method:

    `Uuid->generate`
        Generates a new UUID. `Uuid->coerce(undef)` would also work, but looks
        a little odd.

    `Uuid->generator`
        Returns a coderef which generates a new UUID. For an example usage,
        see the "SYNOPSIS".
