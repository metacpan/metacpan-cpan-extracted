  + Support for (?|pattern)
! t/02-optimizer.t
  + more testing

0.22 2013/02/26 04:51:15
! t/02-optimizer.t
  Since qr// happens compile time, SKIP: is not good enough to make
  older perls (which do not support named captures) to make them skip.

0.21 2013/02/26 04:51:15
! lib/Regexp/Optimizer.pm t/02-optimizer.t
  + Clearner Codes
  + More Tests
  + More Documents

  Completely rewritten.
  + uses Regexp::Assemble to optimize alteration

  Thanks to these changes, this module is now much simpler.

! Regexp/Optimizer.pm
  Perl 5.8.4 and later corrected a bug so it is fatal to go
    my $x = qr{ ... (??{ $x }) ... };
  under "use strict".  Unfortunately Regexp/Optimizer.pm had two
  occurances thereof.  Now fixed.

0.11 2004/05/03 15:09:14
! Regexp/List.pm
  Deep recursion addressed and corrected by yoz@yoz.com

! *
  Version jumps to 0.10 do to radical changes, especially in
  $Regexp::Optimize.
! Regexp/Optimizer.pm t/02-list.t t/03-utf8.t
  Aagh!  Why didn't I come up with such a simple idea !?
  ->optimize is completely rewritten.
  t/*.t is streamlined to reflect changes.
  Now ->optimize() *really* optimizes even for
  qr/(?:1|12)|123/.  Used to return qr/1(?:2?|23)/ but now it
  returns qr/1(?:23?)?/o
! Regexp/Optimizer.pm  Regexp/List.pm
  POD enhanced.

0.02 2003/06/01 00:11:26
! Regexp/Optimizer.pm  Regexp/List.pm
  * Lots of bug fixes regarding $o->optimize() for nested parens
! t/02-list.t
  Test data for #21 corrected
! t/03-utf8.t
  buggy SKIP: sections fixed.
