NAME
    DateTimeX::Format::Ago - I should have written this module "3 years ago"

SYNOPSIS
      my $then = DateTime->now->subtract(days => 3);
      say DateTimeX::Format::Ago->format_datetime($then); # "3 days ago"

DESCRIPTION
    Ever wished DateTime::Format::Natural had a `format_datetime` method? This
    module provides human-friendly datetime formatting, outputting strings
    like "3 days ago".

    Primary use case: websites that show a list of a person's recent
    activities.

  Constructor
    `new(language => $lang)`
        Creates a formatter object for the given language (a BCP47 language
        code). If the language is omitted, extracts it from $ENV{LANG}.

        Decent English ('en'), German ('de'), French ('fr'), Portuguese
        ('pt'), Korean ('ko'), and Indonesian ('id') support is provided.
        Castillian Spanish ('es') is also provided, but some of the strings
        were translated with Google Translate, so they might not be perfect.

  Methods
    `format_datetime($dt)`
        Returns something like "3 days ago", "just now" or "hace un año".

    `parse_datetime($string)`
        Croaks. Don't use this.

BUGS AND LIMITATIONS
  High resolution datetimes
    Imagine the time is currently 2020-01-01T12:00:00.200. If you try to
    format the time 2020-01-01T12:00:00.100 you'll get back the result "in the
    future". So what's going on? DateTimeX::Format::Ago figures out when "now"
    is using `DateTime->now`, which rounds back to the nearest whole second.

    If you know you're going to be dealing with high resolution datetimes, and
    don't want to occasionally see "in the future" for times in the very
    recent past, then use Time::HiRes.

     use Time::HiRes qw();

    That's all you need to do. Merely loading it will give
    DateTimeX::Format::Ago an indication that you want it to use a more
    accurate idea of "now".

  Translations
    This module only supports a handful of languages. I'm seeking
    translations. Feel free to attach patches for other languages as bug
    reports.
