=head1 INSTALL THE SELENIUM SERVER

Selenium is written in Java.  So you need Java.  Ubuntu users should already
have Java installed (C</usr/bin/java>). 

Then download the latest Selenium Server jar file from
L<http://seleniumhq.org/download>.  Put it anywhere.  You can run the server with
this command: 

    java -jar selenium-server.jar -h

=head1 INSTALL Xvfb

Xvfb or X virtual frame buffer is an X server that enables you to run X windows
applications without showing any screen output.  If you run this with a
Selenium server, you can run your tests on various browsers on a server with no
monitor and without X windows installed.  See an example of how to do this in
L<Test::WWW::Selenium::More::Manual::RunningTests>.

To install Xvfb on Ubuntu:

    sudo apt-get install xvfb
