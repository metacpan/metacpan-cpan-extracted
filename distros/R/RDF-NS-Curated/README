NAME
    RDF::NS::Curated - A curated set of RDF prefixes

SYNOPSIS
      my $ns = RDF::NS::Curated->new;
      print $ns->uri('foaf'); # prints http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/
      print $ns->prefix('http://schema.org/'); # prints schema

DESCRIPTION
    This contains a list of 62 prefix and URI pairs that are commonly used in
    RDF. The intention is that prefixes in this list can be safely used in
    code that has a long lifetime. The list has been derived mostly from W3C
    standards documents, but also some popularity lists. See the source code
    of this package for the full list.

    It is intended to be used with e.g. URI::NamespaceMap.

  Methods
    `new`
        Constructor. Takes no arguments.

    `uri($prefix)`
        This will return the URI (as a plain string) of the supplied prefix or
        `undef` if it is not registered.

    `prefix($uri)`
        This will return the prefix corresponding to the supplied URI string
        or `undef` if it is not registered.

    `qname($uri)`
        This will return the qualified name corresponding to the supplied URI
        string or `undef` if it is not registered. In scalar context, it will
        return the prefix and local name with a colon, and list context, a
        two-element array containing prefix and local name.

        For example `http://purl.org/dc/terms/name` will return `dc:name` in
        scalar context and `('dc', 'name')` in list context.

    `all`
        This will return a hashref with all prefix and URI pairs.
