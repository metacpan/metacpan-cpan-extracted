##
## The 'Main' context is configured in cobalt.conf.
## New networks can be configured here under the Networks: directive.
## (If you specify any NickServ or Server passwords here, you may want 
## to consider a permissions adjustment for this file.)
##
## You'll also need channels specified in your channels.conf for any
## configured network contexts.
##
## Super-users will also need a per-context Auth config in auth.conf.
