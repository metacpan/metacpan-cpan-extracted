=head1 NAME

annex-to-annex - use hardlinks to migrate files between git annex repos

=head1 VERSION

version 0.008

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<annex-to-annex> [B<--commit>] I<source> ... I<destination>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This script moves files and directories from one or more git annexes
into a destination git annex, where possible using hardlinks instead
of copying files.

It is useful for splitting and consolidating git annexes.  For
example, at the end of the semester I use this script to move files
from my work annex, which gets synced to a lot of places, into an
archival annex, which doesn't.

Each I<source> should be a file or directory in a git annex.
I<destination> should be a subdirectory of a git annex.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<--commit>

Commit changes in the source and destination annexes.  Otherwise
changes are merely added to the index.
