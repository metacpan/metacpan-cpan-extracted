NAME
    Acme::Constructor::Pythonic - import Python-style constructor functions

SYNOPSIS
        use Acme::Constructor::Pythonic qw(
            LWP::UserAgent
            JSON
            HTTP::Request
        );
    
        my $json = JSON();
        my $ua   = UserAgent();
        my $req  = Request( GET => 'http://www.example.com/foo.json' );
    
        my $data = $json->decode( $ua->request($req)->content )

DESCRIPTION
    In Python you import classes like this:

        import BankAccount from banking

    And you instantiate them with something looking like a function call:

        acct = BankAccount(9.99)

    This module allows Python-like object instantiation in Perl. The example
    in the SYNOPSIS creates three functions `UserAgent`, `JSON` and <Request>
    each of which just pass through their arguments to the real object
    constructors.

  Options
    Each argument to the Acme::Constructor::Pythonic is a Perl module name and
    may be followed by a hashref of options:

        use Acme::Constructor::Pythonic
            'A::Module',
            'Another::Module' => \%some_options,
            'Yes::Another::Module',
        ;

    *   class

        The class to call the constructor on. This is normally the same as the
        module name, and that's the default assumption, so there's no usually
        much point in providing it.

    *   constructor

        The method name for the constructor. The default is `new` which is
        usually correct.

    *   alias

        The name of the function you want created for you. The default is the
        last component of the module name, which is often sensible.

    *   no_require

        Acme::Constructor::Python will automatically load the module
        specified. Not straight away; it waits until you actually perform an
        instantiation. If you don't want Acme::Constructor::Python to load the
        module, then set this option to true.
