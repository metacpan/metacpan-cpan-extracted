Revision history for Perl extension Catalyst::Plugin::Session

0.20 2009-02-05
        - No code changes since 0.19_01 dev release.
        - Add IDEAS.txt which is an irc log of discussion about the next-generation
          session plugin from discussion on #catalyst-dev
        - Remove TODO file, which is no longer relevant.

0.19_01 2009-01-09
        - Switch from using NEXT to Class::C3 for method re-dispatch.
        - Use shipit to package the dist.
        - Switch to Module::install.
        - Flash data is now stored inside the session (key "__flash") to avoid
          duplicate entry errors caused by simultaneous select/insert/delete of
          flash rows when using DBI as a Store. (Sergio Salvi)
        - Fix session finalization order that caused HTTP responses to be sent
          before the session is actually finalized and stored in its Store.
          (Sergio Salvi)

0.19    2007-10-08

0.18    2007-08-15
        - Fix Apache engine issue (RT #28845)

0.17    2007-07-16
        - Skip a test if Cookie is not installed (RT #28137)

0.16    2007-07-03
        - Stupid makefile

0.15    2007-06-24
        - Fix the bug that caused sessions to expire immediately when another
          session was deleted previously in the same request cycle
        - Changed finalize() to redispatch before saving session
          so other finalize methods still have access to it.

0.14    2007-01-31
        - Disable verify_address.
        - update flash to work like session

0.13    2006-10-12
        - Rerelease with slightly changed test due to a behavior change in
          Test::MockObject
        - add `clear_flash`
        - improve debug logging

0.12    2006-08-26
        - refactor out a hookable finalize_session method, for plugins
        - make _clear_session_instance_data call NEXT::, so that plugins can
          hook on to that too

0.11    2006-08-10
        - Lazify expiry calculation and store it in a different instance data
          slot. This provides greater flexibility for implementing hooks like
          DynamicExpiry the "right" way.

0.10    2006-08-01
        - Implement a more well defined finalization order for Session stuff.
          This solves a problem that was introduced by some value cleanups in
          the 0.06 release.

0.09    2006-07-31
        - Fix Catalyst::Plugin::Session::Test::Store

0.08    2006-07-31
        - rerelease because Module::Bane broke the META.yml. HURAAH

0.07    2006-07-30
        - Make build tool complain loudly on incompatible versions of state
          plugins.

0.06    2006-07-29
        - Change State plugin API to be pull oriented
        - Lazify more correctly (mostly performance improvements)
        - Don't try to compute digest of hash when there is no hash

0.05    2006-01-01
        - Un-workaround the Cache::FastMmap (actually Storable) limitation -
          it's not C::P::Session's business.
        - add $c->session_expires
        - refactor guts
        - improve semantics of session deletion (now deletes flash data too)
        - improve lazy-load-ness of session data in the light of expiration

0.04    2005-12-28 09:42:00
        - Work around a limitation in Cache::FastMmap - must store only
          references, while expiration was an NV.

0.03    2005-12-26 10:22:00
        - Lazify loading of session data for better performance and less chance
          of race conditions
        - support for $c->flash a la Ruby on Rails
        - Fixed bug in sessionid algorithm detection.
        - Separate __expires from the session data - we write it every time
        - Lazify saving of session data for better performance and less chance
          of race conditions

0.02    2005-11-23 09:40:00
        - Doc fixes
        - No more -Engine=Test
