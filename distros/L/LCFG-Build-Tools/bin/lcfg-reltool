=head1 NAME

lcfg-reltool - LCFG source release control tool

=head1 VERSION

This documentation refers to lcfg-reltool version 0.9.30

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    lcfg-reltool release --dir ~/cvs/lcfg-foo

    lcfg-reltool minorversion --quiet

    lcfg-reltool rpm

=head1 DESCRIPTION

=head1 COMMANDS

There are two built-in commands:

=over

=item help [command name]

If you call the C<help> command with no arguments it will list all the
supported commands. If you also specify a particular command name it
will show all the available command-line options for that specfic
command.

=item commands

This command gives a list of all available commands.

=back

The following commands are each implemented with a separate Perl
module. For full documentation you need to read the perldoc for the
specific module. They are all in the C<LCFG::Build::Tool> namespace.

=over

=item checkmacros - L<LCFG::Build::Tool::CheckMacros>

Checks the usage of substitution macros in your project.

=item release - L<LCFG::Build::Tool::MicroVersion>

Increment by one the third (smallest) part of the version field and
tag the project. This will also reset the release field to 1. For
example, version 1.2.3 would become 1.2.4 and the release field would
go from 5 to 1.

=item minorversion - L<LCFG::Build::Tool::MinorVersion>

Increment by one the second (middle) part of the version and tag the
project.  This will also reset the third part of the version to 0
(zero) and the release field to 1. For example, version 1.2.3 would
become 1.3.0 and the release field would go from 5 to 1.

=item majorversion - L<LCFG::Build::Tool::MajorVersion>

Increment by one the first (largest) part of the version and tag the
project. This will also reset the second and third parts of the
version to 0 (zero) and the release field to 1. For example, version
1.2.3 would become 2.0.0 and the release field would go from 5 to 1.

=item devpack - L<LCFG::Build::Tool::DevPack>

Builds a gzipped source tar file from the development source tree for
the project. This will include all local files which have been added
to the specified working directory for the project.

=item pack - L<LCFG::Build::Tool::Pack>

Builds a gzipped source tar file from the tagged source tree which
matches the version specified in the LCFG build tools metadata file,
C<lcfg.yml>, in the specified working directory.

=item devrpm - L<LCFG::Build::Tool::DevRPM>

Builds a gzipped source tar file, source RPM and binary RPMs from the
development source tree for the project. This will include all local
files which have been added to the specified working directory for the
project.

=item rpm - L<LCFG::Build::Tool::RPM>

Builds a gzipped source tar file, source RPM and binary RPMs from the
tagged source tree which matches the version specified in the LCFG
build tools metadata file, C<lcfg.yml>, in the specified working
directory.

=item srpm - L<LCFG::Build::Tool::SRPM>

Builds a gzipped source tar file and source RPM from the tagged source
tree which matches the version specified in the LCFG build tools
metadata file, C<lcfg.yml>, in the specified working directory.

=item ospkg - L<LCFG::Build::Tool::OSXPkg>

Builds a gzipped source tar file and binary MacOSX packages from the
tagged source tree which matches the version specified in the LCFG
build tools metadata file, C<lcfg.yml>, in the specified working
directory.

=item devospkg - L<LCFG::Build::Tool::DevOSXPkg>

Builds a gzipped source tar file and binary MacOSX packages from the
development source tree for the project. This will include all local
files which have been added to the specified working directory for the
project.

=back

=head1 CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT

This version-control tool is driven by the LCFG build system meta-file
(C<lcfg.yml>) which MUST exist in the project source directory. This
meta-file uses YAML syntax. The minimum contents is something like
this:

 name: foo
 version: 1.2.3
 vcs:
   type: CVS

See LCFG::Build::PkgSpec for the full details of the possible
options. After a successful version update using the tool you may
notice that the file gains some extra fields with their default
values. The fields will become sorted into alphabetical order to
minimise the differences in the contents between repeated runs of the
tool. Also, a YAML header will be added at the top of the file, this
is not required by this specific tool and can be safely ignored.

Some of the tools use template files, by default it is assumed that
the standard template directory is
C</usr/local/share/lcfgbuild/templates> on MacOSX and
C</usr/share/lcfgbuild/templates> on all other platforms.
You can override this using the LCFG_BUILD_TMPLDIR environment
variable. If you have done a local (i.e. non-root) install of this
module then this will almost certainly be necessary.

=head1 EXIT STATUS

After successfully running a command it will exit with code zero. An
error will result in a non-zero error code.

=head1 DEPENDENCIES

This script uses L<LCFG::Build::Tools> which is L<Moose> powered and
the L<MooseX::App::Cmd> module is used to handle the command-line
interface.

This application also requires an L<LCFG::Build::VCS> module which
supports your choice of version control system,
e.g. L<LCFG::Build::VCS::CVS> for CVS.

=head1 PLATFORMS

This is the list of platforms on which we have tested this
software. We expect this software to work on any Unix-like platform
which is supported by Perl.

Fedora12, Fedora13, ScientificLinux5, ScientificLinux6, MacOSX7

=head1 BUGS AND LIMITATIONS

There are no known bugs in this application. Please report any
problems to bugs@lcfg.org, feedback and patches are also always very
welcome.
