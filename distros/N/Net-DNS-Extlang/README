Net-DNS-Extlang

This module implements the DNS extension language described in this draft:

https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-levine-dnsextlang/

INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install

USE WITH Net::DNS

While Net::DNS::Extlang can load rrtype descriptions from either a
text file or the DNS, when invoked automatically by Net::DNS to handle
an unknown rrtype it only reads from the DNS.  

The dnsextlang draft proposes that rrtype data is stored in the DNS at
{rrname,rrtype}.arpa.  That is the default in Net::DNS since version
1.07.  Until the IETF approves this and puts the info at that
location, you'll have to set the DNS location yourself by setting
$DNSEXTLANG in Net::DNS::Parameters.  For the time being, the author
has put rrtype data at {rrname,rrtype}.services.net, so you can put
this in your program after you include Net::DNS 

    $Net::DNS::Parameters::DNSEXTLANG = 'services.net.';

Once you've done that, the intention is that new rrtypes installed
on the fly work just like the ones built into Net::DNS.  The first
time Net::DNS sees an unknown RR type or number, it creates code
on the fly to handle the type.

Rather than loading Net::DNS::Extlang and its type compiler into the
process that's using Net::DNS, when Net::DNS sees an unknown rrname or
rrtype, looks up the name or type itself in the DNS lookup to find the
description and then passes the description to the external program
RRTYPEgen, which compiles the description into a perl module
Net::DNS::RR::<typename>.  Net::DNS loads the compiled module, and
uses it the same way it uses a built-in RR module.
