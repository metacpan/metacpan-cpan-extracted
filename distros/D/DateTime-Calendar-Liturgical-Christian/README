README for DateTime::Calendar::Liturgical::Christian

This module will return the name, season, week number and liturgical colour
for any day in the Gregorian calendar. It will eventually support the
liturgical calendars of several churches (hopefully at least Anglican,
Lutheran, Orthodox and Roman Catholic). At present it only knows the
calendar for the Episcopal Church of the USA.
