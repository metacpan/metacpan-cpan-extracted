Revision history for Layout-Manager

  _ Remove unnecessary dependency on MooseX::AttributeHelpers

0.33
  - Tables will no longer expand vertically for no reason, nor will they
    unnecessarily squash their contents on re-layout. If the container's height
    is greater than the sum of it's row's minimums then the remainder will
    be split equally between all rows. This may cause problems, but I've not
    uncovered any in my tests so far.
