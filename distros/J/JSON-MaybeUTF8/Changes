Revision history for JSON-MaybeUTF8

1.001     2019-03-13 13:14:37+08:00 Asia/Kuala_Lumpur
    Retains a separate JSON instance for each function.

    This is due to some reports of valid Unicode string data not decoding
    correctly via `decode_json_text` after a script has been running for some
    time: indications point to possible state corruption in the shared JSON
    object, so this is an attempt to mitigate that.

    Aside from requiring perl 5.10, no incompatibility is expected with the
    previous 1.000 release.

1.000     2017-12-29 19:11:07+08:00 Asia/Kuala_Lumpur
    Initial release.
