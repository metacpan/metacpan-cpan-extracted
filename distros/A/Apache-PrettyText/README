NAME
    Apache::PrettyText - Simple mod_perl PerlHandler for text files

SYNOPSIS
            ## In httpd.conf:
            <Perl>
            use Apache::PrettyText;
            </ Perl> ## <-- Omit the space if you copy this example.

            <Files ~ "\.txt$">
            SetHandler perl-script
            PerlHandler Apache::PrettyText
            </Files>

    To modify your Apache server to dynamically format .txt files so they
    look nicer in the client's browser, put the following directives into
    httpd.conf, or in any VirtualHost section and restart the server.

    Optional: Insert a <Perl> section that changes
    $Apache::PrettyText::TabWidth to your site's standard or set to 0 to
    disable detabbing. If you don't set it, the default is 4.

            ## In httpd.conf:
            <Perl>
            $Apache::PrettyText::TabWidth = 4;  
            </ Perl> ## <-- Omit the space if you copy this example.

    You must be using mod_perl. See http://perl.apache.org for details.

DESCRIPTION
    This is a simple Apache handler written in Perl that converts text files
    on the fly into a basic HTML format:

    *   surrounded by <PRE> tags

    *   tabs converted to spaces (optional)

    *   white background

    *   hilited URLs

    *   first line of text file = <TITLE>

    Also serves as a good template to help you write your own simple

    handler. I wrote this as an exercise because I found no good examples.

INSTALLATION
    Using CPAN module:

            perl -MCPAN -e 'install Apache::PrettyText'

    Or manually:

            tar xzvf Apache-PrettyText*gz
            cd Apache-PrettyText-1.??
            perl Makefile.PL
            make
            make test
            make install

    If you're reading this in pod or man, it's already installed. If you're
    reading the source code in PrettyText.pm, you can copy this file under
    the name "PrettyText.pm" into this location:

            /usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/Apache/

    ... or its equivalent on your computer.

    A helpful tip: you can include the entire contents of the PrettyText.pm
    file or of your own version of it into a <Perl> section within
    httpd.conf. This can be very helpful if you'd like to use this module as
    a template for your own.

    To syntax-check your code under those circumstances, use:

            perl -cx httpd.conf

    ... which will read just the perl code between #!...perl and __END__ in
    the httpd.conf file.
