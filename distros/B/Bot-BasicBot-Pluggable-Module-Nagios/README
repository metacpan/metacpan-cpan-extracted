NAME
    Bot::BasicBot::Pluggable::Module::Nagios - report Nagios alerts to IRC

DESCRIPTION
    A module for IRC bots powered by Bot::BasicBot::Pluggable to monitor a
    Nagios install and report alerts to IRC.

    Multiple Nagios instances are supported; these could be separate Nagios
    systems, or just the same Nagios install but using different
    credentials. As each configured instance can have specific target
    channels defined, this means you could have the bot check with the
    username "development" and report all visible problems to the
    `#development' channel, then check again with the "sysad" username and
    report problems visible to that user to the `#sysads' channel.

    Actual monitoring is done using Nagios::Scrape, which scrapes the
    information from the `status.cgi' script which powers Nagios' web
    interface. This means that, assuming your Nagios setup is configured to
    be viewable over the web, you need no further setup to allow the bot to
    monitor it.

SYNOPSIS
    Load the module as you would any other Bot::BasicBot::Pluggable module,
    then configure it to watch a Nagios install and report problems to the
    desired channel(s) with the `nagios add' command.

    In a direct message to the bot:

        <user> nagios add http://nagios.example.com/cgi-bin/status.cgi username password #channel
        <bot> OK
        <user> nagios list
        <bot> I'm currently monitoring the following Nagios instances:
              .. 1 : http://example.com/cgi-bin/status.cgi as dave for #chan
        <user> nagios del 1
        <bot> OK, deleted instance 1

    (You can supply a list of channel names separated by commas, if you want
    reports from a given instance to be announced to more than one channel.)

TODO
    Plenty of improvements are planned, including:

    * Acknowledging problems
        It should probably be possible to acknowledge a reported problem,
        preventing repeated reports of the same service/host in the same
        state.

    * Configurable reporting hours
        It would make sense to be able to configure the bot to only report
        problems during hours in which staff/volunteers are likely to be
        awake and paying attention to the IRC channel.

    * Configurable report templates
        It would be nice to be able to configure the format used for report
        messages - perhaps including colour codes to colourise elements of
        the message, where the channel allows it and users clients support
        it.
