SYNOPSIS

     is(
       "http://example.com/path1/path2?query=1#fragment",
       url {
         url_component scheme   => 'http';
         url_component host     => 'example.com';

       'url is as expected',
     );

DESCRIPTION

    This set of Test2 tools helps writing tests against URLs, represented
    as either strings, or as objects that stringify to URLs (such as URI or
    Mojo::URL).

    The idea is that you may be writing tests against URLs, but you may
    only care about one or two components, and you may not want to worry
    about decoding the URL or breaking the components up. The URL may be
    nested deeply. This tool is intended to help!

FUNCTIONS

 url

     my $check = url {}

    Checks that the given string or object is a valid URL.

 url_base

     url {
       url_base $url;
     };

    Use the given base URL for relative paths. If specified outside of a
    URL, then it will apply to all url checks.

 url_component

     url {
       url_component $component, $check;
     }

    Check that the given URL component matches.
