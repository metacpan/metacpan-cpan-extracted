  files.

0.80     2017-02-02

- Use ~/.pause-maxmind rather than ~/.pause.


0.79     2017-01-05

- Fork DROLSKY bundle to make a separate MAXMIND bundle.


0.78     2016-11-29

- Handle a ppport.h file being generated in a subdirectory as well as in the
  root of the distro.


0.77     2016-11-12

- Generated POD said my IRC nick was "drolsky" instead of "autarch". Reported
  by mst.


0.76     2016-11-01

- Only tell CopyFileFromBuild to copy files that which actually exist in the
  distro. The latest version of that plugin now dies on missing files.


0.75     2016-10-11

- Added pod_coverage_also_private to pass more stuff to
  Test::Pod::Coverage::Configurable


0.74     2016-10-07

- Added CheckSelfDependency and CheckStrictVersion plugins.


0.73     2016-10-02

- Removed Module::Metadata prereq and require Test::Version 2.05 instead.

- Added more docs.


0.70     2016-09-16

- Explicitly add Module::Metadata 1.000033 to the develop prereqs in order to
  work around bugs with Test::Version and earlier versions of
  Module::Metadata. See https://github.com/plicease/Test-Version/issues/7 for
  the relevant bug report.


0.69     2016-09-13

- Very tiny wording change in CONTRIBUTING.md.


0.68     2016-09-12

- Require Perl::Critic::Moose 1.05;


0.67     2016-08-20

- Various tweaks and cleanups for the pod weaver bundle.


0.66     2016-08-13

- Implemented a rather convoluted way of passing config into my Pod::Weaver
  bundle in order to allow for disabling the DONATIONS pod section on a
  per-distro basis.


0.65     2016-07-04

- Avoid warnings when t/ directory contains non-UTF8 data.


0.64     2016-06-26

- If the distro uses Test2 modules, the Test::More prereq is now set to
  1.302015 instead of 0.96. Suggested by Graham Knop.


0.63     2016-06-17

- Small tweak to generated perlcriticrc.


0.62     2016-06-12

- Only run PromptIfStale for release phase.


0.61     2016-06-05

- Don't include GitHub::Meta when running under Travis.


0.60     2016-06-04

- Don't include PromptIfStale when running under Travis. It's not like I can
  stop the build and update prereqs anyway.


0.59     2016-05-30

- Make the generated tidyall.ini only use Test::Vars on modules. It ends up
  running code that it checks, so if you run it on .t files it actually runs
  them, causing all sorts of problems with the tidyall tests.


0.58     2016-05-29

- Set the minimum_perl for the Test::Tidyall plugin to 5.10 since Test::Vars
  requires that version.


0.57     2016-05-28

- Move stale module check to build phase.


0.56     2016-05-21

- Add the Test::Vars tidyall plugin to my default tidyall.ini.


0.55     2016-05-18

- Fix handling of regexes in "exclude" config values.


0.54     2016-05-18

- Set program-extensions in perlcriticrc.


0.51     2016-05-06

- Make sure we set argv for all PerlCritic & PerlTidy sections when munging
  tidyall.ini.


0.50     2016-04-25

- Always make the Test::TidyAll plugin verbose. There's no downside to seeing
  diffs on tidy failures.


0.49     2016-04-24

- When adding Perl::Critic and Perl::Tidy to development prereqs, ask for the
  latest versions.


0.48     2016-04-24

- Only include the DONATIONS pod section for distros where I am the copyright
  holder.


0.47     2016-04-11

- Revert changes in 0.46 that required a recent Perl. This makes testing on
  Travis painful and makes it harder for others to contribute to any module of
  mine which uses this bundle.


0.46     2016-04-11

- Switched from [ExtraTests] to [RunExtraTests].

- Made the TidyAll plugin in this bundle rewrite existing tidyall.ini files to
  make sure we don't try to check or tidy generated xt tests.


0.45     2016-03-20

- Make sure generated Pod does not have trailing whitespace.

- Fix links to mailing lists to be "mailto:" links.


0.44     2016-03-20

- Make sure that all the Pod::Weaver-related modules that this distribution
  uses are added to the prereqs list.


0.43     2016-03-20

- Added [CheckChangesHasContent].

- Added [Test::CLeanNamespaces].

- If the distro has XS code [PPPort] is added and the generated ppport.h is
  copied from the build into the repo.

- This bundle now generates a CONTRIBUTING.md file automatically.

- Added a new Pod::Weaver author bundle that replaces the one-time generation
  of a weaver.ini file.

- Fixed README.md generation to happen after pod weaving, instead of before.


0.42     2016-02-01

- Disabled the Subroutines::ProhibitExplicitReturnUndef policy in the
  generated perlcriticrc file.


0.41     2016-01-29

- Added the Test::CPAN::Meta::JSON plugin.


0.40 2015-11-24

- Added a new plugin, MAXMIND::Git::CheckFor::CorrectBranch. This plugin only
  checks that the branch is correct on non-TRIAL releases.


0.39     2015-11-24

- Added a use_github_homepage config option.


0.38     2015-09-28

- Remove the RewriteVersion plugin and use my own version provider that simply
  reads the version from the main module. I don't want things appending '#
  TRIAL' comments to my version lines and un-tidying my code.


0.37     2015-08-15

- Include MojibakeTests plugin.


0.36     2015-07-12

- Don't include Test::Pod::LinkCheck and Test::Pod::No404s when running under Travis.


0.35     2015-07-05

- Make it possible to use GitHub issues instead of rt.cpan.org.


0.34     2015-05-14

- Always set xt_mode to true for Test::Compile.


0.33     2015-03-10

- Set --iterations=2 in generated perltidyrc.


0.32     2015-02-08

- Set --blank-lines-before-packages=0 in generated perltidyrc.


0.31     2015-01-15

- Perl::Critic and Perl::Tidy need to be the develop requires list for modules
  using this bundle, not in the prereqs of the bundle itself.


0.30     2015-01-13

- Make sure that Perl::Critic and Perl::Tidy end up in the prereqs for the
  benefit of the tidyall test.


0.29     2015-01-11

- Made the plugin bundle commit and push the post-release version bump.


0.28     2015-01-11

- Replaced PkgVersion with BumpVersionAfterRelease and added
  CheckVersionIncrement and Test::Version for good measure.

- Added Test::TidyAll and a plugin to generate default tidyall.ini,
  perltidyrc, and perlcriticrc files for my distros.


0.27     2014-12-20

- Replace GatherDir and PruneCruft with Git::GatherDir.


0.26     2014-11-15

- The generated Makefile.PL or Build.PL file is now copied into the repo and
  checked in for each release.


0.25     2014-11-09

- This bundle now consumes the Dist::Zilla::Role::PluginBundle::Config::Slicer
  role to allow for arbitrary plugin configuration.


0.24     2014-11-04

- Make sure that a copyright_holder in dist.ini overrides the default of
  "David Rolsky".


0.23     2014-11-02

- Oops, accidentally removed the CopyFilesFromBuild plugin from the prereq
  list in the last release.


0.22     2014-11-02

- The MAXMIND::Contributors plugin now leaves existing .mailmap and weaver.ini
  files alone.

- Generate a cpanfile and copy it into the repo after a build.

- Copy the LICENSE file into the repo after abuild.


0.21     2014-11-01

- Added custom plugins to setup the weaver.ini file for Contributors and to
  automatically provide default license info.


0.20     2014-11-01

- Explicitly depend on Dist::Zilla::Plugin::PodWeaver because
  SurgicalPodWeaver doesn't - works around RT #87624.


0.19     2014-10-23

- Switched to Test::EOL (0.14)

- Make PkgVersion use a bit smarter (no line insertion and die on existing
  $VERSION in module)

- Update next release version to indicate if a release is a trial


0.18     2014-09-03

- Use Test::NoTabs plugin instead of NoTabsTests.


0.08     2014-04-05

- Internals fixes to work with Config::MVP that is stricter about handling
  plugin options passed by this bundle. Reported by Karen Etheridge. RT
