Module
    DBD::CSV - DBI driver for CSV files

Description
    The DBD::CSV module is yet another driver for the DBI (Database
    independent interface for Perl). This one is based on the SQL
    "engine" SQL::Statement and the abstract DBI driver DBD::File
    and implements access to so-called CSV files (Comma separated
    values).

    Feel free to clone your own copy:

     $ git clone https://github.com/perl5-dbi/DBD-CSV.git DBD-CSV

    or get it as a tgz:

     $ wget --output-document=DBD-CSV-git.tgz \
	'https://github.com/perl5-dbi/DBD-CSV/archive/master.tar.gz

    which will unpack to DBD-CSV-master

Prerequisites:
    DBI - the DBI (Database independent interface for Perl).

    SQL::Statement - a simple SQL engine.

    Text::CSV_XS - this module is used for writing rows to or reading
	rows from CSV files.

Build/Installation:
    Use CPAN:
      cpan DBD::CSV

    Or standard build/installation:
      gzip -cd DBD-CSV-0.43.tar.gz | tar xf -
      cd DBD-CSV-0.43
      perl Makefile.PL
      make test
      make install

    (this is for Unix users, Windows users would prefer PowerArchiver,
    WinZip or something similar).

    The test suite contains extensive tests for all features provided
    by DBD::CSV. Some of them include the use of what is set to be the
    default temporary directory on the system. Even though the tests
    do not use the folder to read or modify data, using the folder will
    imply the scanning of that folder to see if files would qualify for
    use in DBD::CSV. When the folder contains many files, the scanning
    will seriously slow down the testing duration. The configure phase
    therefor asks the user if using the folder is allowed. The default
    answer is yes unless $AUTOMATED_TESTING is set.
    As File::Spec->tmpdir () honors the environment, you can enable
    these tests using another folder by setting $TMPDIR or whatever
    controls tmpdir () or your OS.
