NAME
    Gentoo::Dependency::AST - Convert a canonicalized (R|P|)DEPEND into an
    Abstract Syntax Tree

VERSION
    version 0.001001

SYNOPSIS
    Those familiar with Gentoo's "ebuild" format will be aware there are
    several variables that contain strings of dependencies that are
    required.

    Namely: "PDEPEND" , "RDEPEND" and "DEPEND"

    If you're a "paludis" user, one can get the canonicalized versions of
    these variables via

        cave show -c =cat/pkg-version

    This module exists to parse those strings and provide a structured graph
    representing the dependencies:

        use Gentoo::Dependency::AST;

        my $node = Gentoo::Dependency::AST->parse_dep_string( $string_from_portage );

METHODS
  "parse_dep_string"
        $class->parse_dep_string( $string )  # returns Gentoo::Dependency::AST::Node of some kind
