    certain stash

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.002 of Dist::Zilla::Role::EnsureStash
    - released December 30, 2012 as part of Dist-Zilla-Role-EnsureStash.

SYNOPSIS
        package Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Something;

        use Moose;
        use namespace::autoclean;

        with
            'Dist::Zilla::Plugin::BeforeRelease',
            'Dizt::Zilla::Role::EnsureStash',
            ;

        sub our_stash_name  { '%ThatStash'                    }
        sub our_stash_class { 'Dist::Zilla::Stash::ThatStash' }

        sub before_release {
            my $self = shift @_;

            # returns '%ThatStash' if it exists, otherwise creates, registers,
            # then returns it
            my $stash = $self->our_stash;

            # profit!
        }

DESCRIPTION
    This is a Dist::Zilla role designed to ensure that if a plugin needs
    access to a stash, and that stash does not already exist, then it is
    automatically created and returned.

    This is more intended for helping plugins that need to share common data
    do so via stashes, rather than specific information (e.g. PAUSE
    credentials and the like). As such, the stash instances created here are
    expected to largely be able to do their thing without much (preferably
    any) external input.

REQUIRED METHODS
  our_stash_name
    Just as it sounds; should return something Dist::Zilla will recognize as
    a stash name (e.g. %SomeStash).

  our_stash_class
    This is expected to return the class name of the class to be created and
    registered as "our_stash_name()" if a stash by that name does not exist.

    It is expected to have consumed the Dist::Zilla::Role::Stash role.
