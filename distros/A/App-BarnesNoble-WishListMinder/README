App-BarnesNoble-WishListMinder version 0.004, released December 20, 2014


This application can fetch wishlists from Barnes & Noble, extract the
books & pricing information, save it to a SQLite database, track
pricing changes, and email alerts when the price drops.



INSTALLATION

To install this application, run the following commands:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install
	bn-wishlist --configure

You will probably also want to add this command to your crontab:

	bn-wishlist --email --quiet

I suggest running it once a day at a time of your choice.
