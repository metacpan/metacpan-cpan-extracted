NAME
    Lingua::EN::Inflect::Phrase - Inflect short English Phrases

SYNOPSIS
      use Lingua::EN::Inflect::Phrase;
      use Test::More tests => 2;

      my $plural   = Lingua::EN::Inflect::Phrase::to_PL('green egg and ham');

      is $plural, 'green eggs and ham';

      my $singular = Lingua::EN::Inflect::Phrase::to_S('green eggs and ham');

      is $singular, 'green egg and ham';

DESCRIPTION
    Attempts to pluralize or singularize short English phrases.

    Does not throw exceptions at present, if you attempt to pluralize an
    already pluralized phrase, it will leave it unchanged (and vice versa.)

    The behavior of this module is subject to change as I tweak the
    heuristics, as some things get fixed others might regress. The
    processing of natural language is a messy business.

    If it doesn't work, please email or submit to RT the example you tried,
    and I'll try to fix it.

OPTIONS
    By default, this module prefers to treat words as nouns (sometimes words
    can be interpreted as a verb or a noun without context.) This is better
    for things such as database table/column names, which is what this
    module is primarily for.

    This behavior can be switched with the variable $prefer_nouns. The
    default is 1.

    For example:

      {
        local $Lingua::EN::Inflect::Phrase::prefer_nouns = 0;
        is Lingua::EN::Inflect::Phrase::to_S('sources split'), 'source splits';
      }
      {
        local $Lingua::EN::Inflect::Phrase::prefer_nouns = 1;
        is Lingua::EN::Inflect::Phrase::to_S('source splits'), 'source split';
      }

OPTIONAL EXPORTS
    "to_PL", "to_S"

SUBROUTINES
  to_PL
    Attempts to pluralizes a phrase unless already plural.

  to_S
    Attempts to singularize a phrase unless already singular.
