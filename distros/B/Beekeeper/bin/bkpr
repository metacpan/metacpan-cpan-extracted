=head1 DESCRIPTION

This command line tool is used to start, restart or stop worker pools of persistent
L<Beekeeper::Worker> processes which receive RPC requests from the message bus.

When started it daemonizes itself (unless C<--foreground> option is passed) and forks
all worker processes, then keeps monitoring those forked processes and immediately
respawns defunct ones.

Beekeeper applications use config files C<pool.config.json> and C<bus.config.json> to
define how clients, workers and brokers connect to each other. These files are looked
for in ENV C<BEEKEEPER_CONFIG_DIR>, C<~/.config/beekeeper>and then C</etc/beekeeper>.

=head1 SEE ALSO
 
L<Beekeeper::WorkerPool>, L<Beekeeper::Config>.
