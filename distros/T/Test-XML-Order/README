    Test::XML::Order - Compare the order of XML tags in perl tests

VERSION
    Version 1.01

SYNOPSIS
      use Test::XML::Order tests => 3;
      is_xml_in_order( '<foo /><foo />', '<foo></foo><foo x="a"/>' );   # PASS
      is_xml_in_order( '<foo /><bar />', '<bar /><foo />' );       # FAIL
      isnt_xml_in_order( '<foo /><bar />', '<bar /><foo />' );     # PASS

DESCRIPTION
    This module contains generic XML testing tools. See below for a list of
    other modules with functions relating to specific XML modules.

FUNCTIONS
    is_xml_in_order ( GOT, EXPECTED [, TESTNAME ] )
        This function compares GOT and EXPECTED, both of which are strings
        of XML. The comparison works only on the order of the tags,
        attributes are ignored.

        Returns true or false, depending upon test success.

    isnt_xml_in_order( GOT, MUST_NOT_BE [, TESTNAME ] )
        This function is similar to is_xml_in_order(), except that it will
        fail if GOT and MUST_NOT_BE have elements in the same order.

NOTES
    Please note the following about Test::XML::Order.

    *   The package does not check that the input is well formed XML. You
        should use "Test::XML" or a similar package if you want to make sure
        the XML is well formed.

    *   Only the order of tags are checked, so

          is_xml_in_order('<a a="b"/>x<b></b>', '<a/><b a="c">asdf</b>');

        passes as the inputs have the same order: '<a/><b/>'.

    *   The tree structure is tested so the the test below passes.

          isnt_xml_in_order('<a><b/></a>', '<a/><b/>');
