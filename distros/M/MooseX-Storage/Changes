      choke with a bad checksum due to odd Data::Dumper
      output.

  - t/
    - forced JSON::Any in the basic JSON tests to use
      JSON.pm since this is what Test::JSON uses and
      subtle (and annoying) issues can arise.

0.04    2007-07-03

  - MooseX::Storage::Engine
    - better error reporting when cycles are found
    - class names are now stored as the full identifier
      (<class>-<version>-<authority>) and are checked

  - This was Chris's idea originally (blame him), and
