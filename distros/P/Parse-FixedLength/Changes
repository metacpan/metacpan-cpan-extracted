5.37  Thu Dec 30 16:00:00  2005
    - Fix bug in C/c format.
5.36  Thu Dec  1 16:00:00  2005

    - Updated Manifest. Someday I'll automate this.
5.34  Fri May 20 11:00:00  2005
    - Added parse_hash(), and parse_newref() convenience methods.
      Inspired by rt ticket by Curtis "Mr_Person" Hawthorne.
    - Fixes to pod, and addition of pod tests.
5.33  Wed Jul 21 17:00:00  2004
    - Second hash_to_obj call with same keys as first wasn't working.
    - Fixed tests (changed 'ref' to 'isa') which broke after previous change.
    - Made example in doc use strict compliant (eliminated bare word string).
    - Added format_str() to retrieve pack/unpack format string from parser.
5.32  Fri Jun 11 17:00:00  2004
    - Allow any valid pack()/unpack() format in the length field
5.31  Tue Jun 8 17:00:00  2004
    - To autoload an lvalue method, AUTOLOAD must be
      declared as an lvalue method.
5.30  Fri Apr 16 17:00:00  2004
    - Took out Makefile.PL code for changing name of test
      module (see if it shows up on CPAN).
    - Document hash_to_obj() method and various other doc
      format changes.
5.29  Thu Apr 15 17:00:00  2004
    - Doc glitch fix.
5.28  Thu Apr 15 17:00:00  2004
    - Any single parser will return the same hash ref on every
      call to parse(). See Caveats.
    - Return blessed hash ref object from parse().
    - Doc cleanup. I may finally be getting the hang of this
      pod stuff.
5.27  Mon Oct 6 17:00:00  2003
    - Just doc fixes. Patch by Terrence Brannon.
5.26  Tue Sep 25 17:00:00  2001
    - Changed the way the subclass test module is created. It was bugging me
      having to un-rename the test module for a 'make tardist' after a
      'make test'.
    - added ':all' argument to import argument list. Added test.
5.25  Mon Sep 24 17:00:00  2001
    - Added trim option to new method. Added test.
    - Allow filehandle to be passed to debug option.
5.24  Wed Sep 19 17:00:00  2001
    - Added all_lengths option to parser new() method.
    - Changed subclass*.t tests so that the test module doesn't show up
      on CPAN. No one else that I can find has seemed to worry about this.
      I'll be the first :-)
5.23  Fri Sep 14 18:00:00  2001
    - If no_pack was true for converter object, passing false to
      convert method was ignored. Added another test.
5.22  Fri Sep 14 15:00:00  2001
    - Allow no_pack argument in convert method, added tests
5.21  Fri Sep 14 08:00:00  2001
    - Fixed subclass example.
    - Added tests for subclassing / import method.
5.20  Thu Sep 13 18:00:00  2001
    - Fixed docs.
5.19  Thu Sep 13 15:25:22  2001
    - Added import method and allow subclass name to be passed to new()
      for convenient subclassing.
    - Fixed the docs.
5.18  Fri Aug 17 19:25:22  2001
    - Fixed dumper() for hash-like format with right justification. Thanks
      to John Cotter for the catch.
5.16  Mon Aug 13 20:19:36  2001
    - Found bug in checking for argument type in Parse::FixedLength::new().
    - took out Scalar::Util::reftype. Could not detect any benefit.
    - Changed croak()'s to confess()'s.
5.15  Sun Aug 12 14:13:06 PDT 2001
    - Better error checking on default argument types in converter method.
    - Added option to not pack during convert method.
5.14  Wed Aug  1 Some time later...
    - Better error checking on start and end positions. If start is present,
      then both start and end need to be present.
5.12  Wed Aug  1 08:31:10 PDT 2001
    - More error checking, this time for duplicate fields in the format, and
      an option to get around the check.
    - Added tests for new option.
5.11  Mon Jul 30 Later on...
    - Added more tests.
    - Fixed 'no_validate' option (which wasn't documented yet anyway, along
      with the start/end validation in general. Add info to docs about this.
5.10  Mon Jul 30 08:47:49 PDT 2001
    - Fixed doc examples.
    - Added more tests.
    - Right justify with no pad character was not defaulting to space.
5.09  Fri Jul 27 Not much later...
    - Eval anonymous subs in convert() for better error reporting.
5.08  Fri Jul 27 18:31:02 PDT 2001
    - Some doc fixes.
    - Various changes after a code review with Graham Barr at TPC,
      e.g., like adding error checking, making ":" the default delimiter,
      auto-detecting the formats, and talking me into using Scalar::Util.
5.07  Thu Jul 26 12:51:11 PDT 2001
    - Slight efficiency in construction of pack string for (what I
      think is) the common case.
    - Allow converter() method to accept a hashref or arrayref as
      mapping argument.
    - Allow convert() method to accept a hash reference as input.
5.06  Wed Jul 25 10:18:57 PDT 2001
    - Added dump() method.
    - Separated converter objects from parser objects to make a better
      cleaner OO universe.
    - Cleaned up docs, added examples.
5.05  Tue Jul 24 Later in the day...
    - For right justification, if the new format is shorter than the data,
      we need to trim leading 'pad' characters, not just whitespace.
5.04  Tue Jul 24 12:31:35 PDT 2001
    - Added right-justification option.
    - Added the questionable feature of the convert method to facilitate
      converting fixed length formats along with a corresponding test.
    - Noticed the similar functionality/purpose of Data::FixedFormat.
      Oh well, make up your own mind which you'd like to use...I kind
      of like this one :)
5.03  Thu Jun 28 08:04:27 PDT 2001
    - Improved documentation.
    - Added length method and more examples, took out some temp variables to
      tighten up code and obfuscate it a bit :)
5.01  Wed Jun 27 12:06:00 PDT 2001
    - Took up the original author's offer to rewrite this module, so I've no
      idea what happened before this change, there were no other notes except
      the 0.01 entry.
    - Changed to OO style, now uses unpack instead of substr for efficiency,
      removed some features (for now?) like the predefined parsing
      constants, but added others (like optionally returning a list
      instead of a hashref).
