PerlDAV -- A WebDAV client library for Perl5
    PerlDAV is a Perl library for modifying content on webservers using the
    WebDAV protocol. Now you can LOCK, DELETE and PUT files and much more on
    a DAV-enabled webserver.

    The PerlDAV library consists of:

    *   HTTP::DAV - an object-oriented Web-DAV client API.

    *   dave - the DAV Explorer, an end-user Unix console program for
        interacting with WebDAV servers. dave looks and feels like a
        standard Unix ftp program.

LATEST VERSION AND WHAT'S NEW
    See the included "Changes" file for the full changelog.

INSTALLING HTTP::DAV
    The lazy way to install PerlDAV:

       $ cpan HTTP::DAV

    Or the normal way:

    Retrieve the latest copy from CPAN:
    https://metacpan.org/module/HTTP-DAV/

       $ perl Makefile.PL # Creates the Makefile
       $ make             # Runs the makefile
       $ make test        # Optional (See Interopability below)
       $ make install     # Installs dave and HTTP::DAV

    With this method you will first have to install the pre-requisites: LWP
    and XML::DOM, see "what are the prerequisites?".

    When you install PerlDAV, the HTTP::DAV library will be installed to
    your Perl library location (usually /usr/local/lib/perl5)

    "dave" will be installed to /usr/local/bin. This suits most people but
    you can modify this by using the INSTALLBIN flag:

       $ perl Makefile.PL INSTALLBIN="/home/user/bin"

  What Are The Prerequisites?
    *   Perl 5.6.0+

    *   LWP (Have not tested lower than v5.48)

    *   Scalar::Util (standard library from 5.8.0+)

    *   XML::DOM (Have not tested lower than v1.26). Requires James Clark's
        expat library:

    *   To access SSL urls you will need Crypt::SSLeay and/or
        IO::Socket::SSL.

  Optional Prerequisites.
    *   Crypt::SSLeay if you'd like to use https. Crypt::SSLeay requires the
        openssl library as well. See Crypt::SSLeay's excellent install
        instructions for how to get https support into LWP (and hence
        HTTP::DAV). I've tested HTTP::DAV and Crypt::SSLeay against
        Apache/mod_dav with the mod_ssl plugin. Works seamlessly.

    *   MD5 if you'd like to use LWP's Digest authentication.

    To get the latest versions of these prerequisite modules you can simply
    type this at the command prompt:

       $ <install expat>
    then:
       $ perl -MCPAN -e shell
       cpan> install LWP
       cpan> install XML::DOM

    or if you just 'install HTTP::DAV' the lovely CPAN module should just
    magically install all of the prerequisites for you (you'll still need to
    manually instal expat though).

  What Systems Does It Work With?
    HTTP::DAV and dave are pure perl so only needs Perl 5.6.0 (or later).
    PerlDAV is known to run under Windows (although I haven't tried it
    myself) and should run under all Unix systems.

WHERE ARE THE MANUALS?
    Once you've installed PerlDAV, you can type:

       $ perldoc HTTP::DAV
       $ man dave

GETTING HELP
  The perldav mailing list
    There is a mailing list for PerlDAV for use by Developers and Users.
    Please see http://mailman.webdav.org/mailman/listinfo/perldav

THE TEST SUITE & INTEROPERABILITY
    You will notice that the standard "make test" command invokes a large
    set of test procedures, but most will be skipped. This standard test is
    sufficient to give you a good indication that PerlDAV has installed
    properly.

    If you'd like to see how well PerlDAV performs against a particular DAV
    server then you should set the URL (and username,password) in the test
    suite t/TestDetails.pm. Then you can run "make test" again and watch the
    test suite perform as many operations as the server supports. Please
    note that the test suite will perofrm well over 200 HTTP requests to
    your server.

    I have tested PerlDAV against IIS5, mod_dav and the Xythos WFS.

    Out of the box, the test suite should NOT fail on any tests.

    The test suite is the best way to test interopability between PerlDAV
    and other servers. I'd really like help with testing PerlDAV's
    interoperability. So if one or more tests fail against your server
    please follow the following steps:

    *   Determine which test is failing.

    *   set DEBUG to on: edit the script and change HTTP::DAV::DebugLevel(0)
        to (3).

    *   Delete previous server output: rm /tmp/perldav_debug.txt

    *   Run that single test again:

        $make test TEST_FILES=t/thetest.t TEST_VERBOSE=1 > testoutput.log

    *   Then gzip and mail me both testoutput.log and /tmp/perldav_debug.txt
        with details of the test environment. (My email is at the bottom)

    Alternatively, you could have a shot at solving the bug yourself :)

BUGS and TODO
    Need to convert XML::DOM to a DOM Level 2 compliant parser like
    XML::Gdome.

See TODO for what is left to be done.
