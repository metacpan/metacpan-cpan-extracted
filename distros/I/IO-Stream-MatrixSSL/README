DESCRIPTION

    This module is plugin for IO::Stream which allow you to use SSL (on
    both client and server streams).

INTERFACE

 IO::Stream::MatrixSSL::Client

  new

        $plugin_ssl_client = IO::Stream::MatrixSSL::Client->new();
    
        $plugin_ssl_client = IO::Stream::MatrixSSL::Client->new({
            crt         => '/path/to/client.crt',
            key         => '/path/to/client.key',
            pass        => 's3cret',
            trusted_CA  => '/path/to/ca-bundle.crt',
            cb          => \&validate,
        });

    Create and returns new IO::Stream plugin object.

    crt

    key

    pass

      Authenticate client on server using client's certificate. (You'll
      need Crypt::MatrixSSL3 compiled with support for client
      authentication.)

      crt and key should contain file names of client's certificate and
      private key (in PEM format), pass should contain password (as string)
      for private key.

      You can provide multiple file names with client's certificates in crt
      separated by ;.

      All optional (crt and key should be either both provided or both
      omitted, pass should be provided only if key file protected by
      password).

    trusted_CA

      This should be name of file (or files) with allowed CA certificates,
      required to check RSA signature of server certificate.
      Crypt::MatrixSSL3 provides such a file, so chances are you doesn't
      need to change default {trusted_CA} value
      ($Crypt::MatrixSSL3::CA_CERTIFICATES) if you just wanna connect to
      public https servers.

      There may be many files listed in {trusted_CA}, separated by ;. Each
      file can contain many CA certificates.

    cb

      This should be CODE ref to your callback, which will check server
      certificate. Callback will be called with two parameters:
      IO::Stream::MatrixSSL::Client (or IO::Stream::MatrixSSL::Server - if
      you're validating client's certificate) object and HASH ref with
      certificate details (see "SYNOPSIS" for example).

      Callback should return a number >=0 if this certificate is
      acceptable, and we can continue with SSL handshake, or number <0 if
      this certificate isn't acceptable and we should interrupt this
      connection and return error to IO::Stream user callback. If this
      function will throw exception, it will be handled just as return(-1).

      Hash with certificate details will looks this way:

          verified       => $verified,
          notBefore      => $notBefore,
          notAfter       => $notAfter,
          subjectAltName => {
              dns             => $dns,
              uri             => $uri,
              email           => $email,
              },
          subject        => {
              country         => $country,
              state           => $state,
              locality        => $locality,
              organization    => $organization,
              orgUnit         => $orgUnit,
              commonName      => $commonName,
              },
          issuer         => {
              country         => $country,
              state           => $state,
              locality        => $locality,
              organization    => $organization,
              orgUnit         => $orgUnit,
              commonName      => $commonName,
              },

      where all values are just strings except these:

          $verified
              Status of cetrificate RSA signature check:
              -1  signature is wrong
               1  signature is correct
          $notBefore
          $notAfter
              Time period when certificate is active, in format
              YYYYMMDDHHMMSSZ     (for ex.: 20061231235959Z)

  stream

        $stream = $plugin_ssl_client->stream();

    Returns IO::Stream object related to this plugin object.

 IO::Stream::MatrixSSL::Server

    Same as above for IO::Stream::MatrixSSL::Client.

MIGRATION

    MatrixSSL often makes incompatible API changes, and so does
    Crypt::MatrixSSL3. Sometimes because of this IO::Stream::MatrixSSL also
    change API in incompatible way, and below explained how to migrate your
    code.

 1.1.2 to 2.0.0

    Parameters for validation callback was changed:

        sub validate {
            ### WAS
            my ($certs, $ssl, $stream) = ($_[0], @{ $_[1] });
    
            ### NOW
            my ($ssl, $certs) = @_;
            my $stream = $ssl->stream();
    
            ...
        }

    Some error messages was changed too.
