Convert most of test.pl into standard t/*.t tests.

Record ORACLE_HOME when building (auto::DBD::Oracle::mk)
Check emails from Oracle about that.

Check fix for unassigned placeholder (alen==SvLEN) can't be
triggered by a valid assignment that's exactly that long.

Resolve imp_sth->stmt_type != OCI_STMT_SELECT issue - add an attribute for it?

connect with $user = "/ as sysdba" etc as per SQL*Plus

Move urls from README into Oracle.pm

Change all uses of perl global na (SvPV & sv_2pv) to local variables
for better thread safety.

Test script for bind type / field type / length / null interactions
of char/varchar types.

add docs about OPS$ login

Add hint about SQL*Plus commands if execute gets an ORA-0900 invalid SQL
statement? Maybe just if common SQL*Plus command word is first word.

Support SERVICE_NAME in new connect syntax (allow inplace of SID)

warn (trace_msg?) if ORACLE_HOME changes after first connect
relates to Apache::DBI scenario where changing ORACLE_HOME
upsets existing connections.

PRECISION for oci7 on VARCHAR etc

Detect "Error while trying to retrieve text for error ORA-XXXX"
and add "refer to oracle docs or use 'oerr ora XXXX'".

blob_read for oci8 with LONGs

$sth = $dbh->prepare("select ... for update");
$dbh->commit;
$sth->execute; # fails ? auto-re-prepare?

ora_bind() failed err = ORA-01026: multiple buffers of size > 4000 in
the bind list (DBD: oexec error)
