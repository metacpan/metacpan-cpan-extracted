NAME

    Test::Pod::No404s - Using this test module will check your POD for any
    http 404 links

VERSION

      This document describes v0.02 of Test::Pod::No404s - released November 01, 2014 as part of Test-Pod-No404s.

SYNOPSIS

            #!/usr/bin/perl
            use strict; use warnings;
    
            use Test::More;
    
            eval "use Test::Pod::No404s";
            if ( $@ ) {
                    plan skip_all => 'Test::Pod::No404s required for testing POD';
            } else {
                    all_pod_files_ok();
            }

DESCRIPTION

    This module looks for any http(s) links in your POD and verifies that
    they will not return a 404. It uses LWP::UserAgent for the heavy
    lifting, and simply lets you know if it failed to retrieve the
    document. More specifically, it uses $response->is_error as the "test."

    This module does NOT check "pod" or "man" links like L<Test::Pod> in
    your pod. For that, please check out Test::Pod::LinkCheck.

    Normally, you wouldn't want this test to be run during end-user
    installation because they might have no internet! It is HIGHLY
    recommended that this be used only for module authors' RELEASE_TESTING
    phase. To do that, just modify the synopsis to add an env check :)

METHODS

 pod_file_ok

    pod_file_ok() will okay the test if there is no http(s) links present
    in the POD or if all links are not an error. Furthermore, if the POD
    was malformed as reported by Pod::Simple, the test will fail and not
    attempt to check the links.

    When it fails, pod_file_ok() will show any failing links as
    diagnostics.

    The optional second argument TESTNAME is the name of the test. If it is
    omitted, pod_file_ok() chooses a default test name "404 test for
    FILENAME".

 all_pod_files_ok

    This function is what you will usually run. It automatically finds any
    POD in your distribution and runs checks on them.

    Accepts an optional argument: an array of files to check. By default it
    checks all POD files it can find in the distribution. Every file it
    finds is passed to the pod_file_ok function.

EXPORT

    Automatically exports the two subs.
