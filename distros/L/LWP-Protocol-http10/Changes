Initial release of LWP-Protocol-http10 as a separate distribution. There are no code
changes besides setting the version number since libwww-perl-6.01.

The LWP::Protocol::http10 module used to be bundled with the libwww-perl
distribution, but it was unbundled in v6.02 as part of general cleanup for
the 6-series.  LWP::Protocol::http10 is deprecated.
