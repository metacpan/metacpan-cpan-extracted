NAME
    Catalyst::Plugin::Session::State::Cookie - Maintain session IDs using
    cookies.

SYNOPSIS
        use Catalyst qw/Session Session::State::Cookie Session::Store::Foo/;

DESCRIPTION
    In order for Catalyst::Plugin::Session to work the session ID needs to
    be stored on the client, and the session data needs to be stored on the
    server.

    This plugin stores the session ID on the client using the cookie
    mechanism.

METHODS
    make_session_cookie
        Returns a hash reference with the default values for new cookies.

    update_session_cookie $hash_ref
        Sets the cookie based on "cookie_name" in the response object.

    calc_expiry
    calculate_session_cookie_expires
    cookie_is_rejecting
    delete_session_id
    extend_session_id
    get_session_cookie
    get_session_id
    set_session_id

EXTENDED METHODS
    prepare_cookies
        Will restore if an appropriate cookie is found.

    finalize_cookies
        Will set a cookie called "session" if it doesn't exist or if its
        value is not the current session id.

    setup_session
        Will set the "cookie_name" parameter to its default value if it
        isn't set.

CONFIGURATION
    cookie_name
        The name of the cookie to store (defaults to
        "Catalyst::Utils::apprefix($c) . '_session'").

    cookie_domain
        The name of the domain to store in the cookie (defaults to current
        host)

    cookie_expires
        Number of seconds from now you want to elapse before cookie will
        expire. Set to 0 to create a session cookie, ie one which will die
        when the user's browser is shut down.

    cookie_secure
        If this attribute set to 0 the cookie will not have the secure flag.

        If this attribute set to 1 (or true for backward compatibility) -
        the cookie send by the server to the client will got the secure flag
        that tells the browser to send this cookies back to the server only
        via HTTPS.

        If this attribute set to 2 then the cookie will got the secure flag
        only if the request that caused cookie generation was sent over
        https (this option is not good if you are mixing https and http in
        you application).

        Default vaule is 0.

    cookie_httponly
        If this attribute set to 0, the cookie will not have HTTPOnly flag.

        If this attribute set to 1, the cookie will got HTTPOnly flag that
        should prevent client side Javascript accessing the cookie value -
        this makes some sort of session hijacking attacks significantly
        harder. Unfortunately not all browsers support this flag (MSIE 6
        SP1+, Firefox 3.0.0.6+, Opera 9.5+); if a browser is not aware of
        HTTPOnly the flag will be ignored.

        Default value is 1.

        Note1: Many peole are confused by the name "HTTPOnly" - it does not
        mean that this cookie works only over HTTP and not over HTTPS.

        Note2: This paramater requires Catalyst::Runtime 5.80005 otherwise
        is skipped.

    cookie_path
        The path of the request url where cookie should be baked.

    For example, you could stick this in MyApp.pm:

      __PACKAGE__->config( 'Plugin::Session' => {
         cookie_domain  => '.mydomain.com',
      });

CAVEATS
    Sessions have to be created before the first write to be saved. For
    example:

            sub action : Local {
                    my ( $self, $c ) = @_;
                    $c->res->write("foo");
                    $c->session( ... );
                    ...
            }

    Will cause a session ID to not be set, because by the time a session is
    actually created the headers have already been sent to the client.
