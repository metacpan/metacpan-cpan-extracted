      my $fmt = Text::FixedLengthMultiline->new(format => ['!name' => 10, 1, 'comment~' => 20, 1, 'age' => -2 ]);

      # Compute the RegExp that matches the first line
      my $first_line_re = $fmt->get_first_line_re();
      # Compute the RegExp that matches a continuation line
      my $continue_line_re = $fmt->get_continue_line_re();

      my @data;
      my $err;
      while ($text =~ /^([^\n]+)$/gm) {
          my $line = $1;
          push @data, {} if $line =~ $first_line_re;
          if (($err = $fmt->parse_line($line, $data[$#data])) > 0) {
              warn "Parse error at column $err";
          }
      }

DESCRIPTION
    A row of data can be splitted on multiple lines of text with cell
    content flowing in the same column space.

FORMAT SPECIFICATION
    The format is given at the contruction time as an array ref. Modifying
    the array content after the construction call is done at your own risks.

    The array contains the ordered sequence of columns. Each colmun can
    either be:

    *   a positive integer representing the size of a separating column
        which is expected to always be filled with spaces.

    *   a string that matches this regexp:
        /^(?#mandatory)!?(?#name)[:alnum:]\w*(?:(?#multi)~(?#cont).?)?$/

        *   `!' means the column is mandatory

        *   `name' is the column name. This will be the key for the hash
            after parsing.

        *   `~' means the column data can be on multiple lines.

METHODS
  new()
    Arguments:

    *   `format': an array reference following the FORMAT SPECIFICATION.

    *   `debug'

    Example:

      my $format = Text::FixedLengthMultiline->new(format => [ 2, col1 => 4, 1, '!col2' => 4 ]);

  `parse_table($text)'
    Parse a table.

      my @table = $fmt->parse_table($text);

    Returns an array of hashes. Each hash is a row of data.

  `parse_line($line, $hashref)'
    Parse a line of text and add parsed data to the hash.

      my $error = $fmt->parse_line($line, \%row_data);

    Multiple calls to `parse_line()' with the same hashref may be needed to
    fully read a "logical line" in case some columns are multiline.

    Returns:

    *   `-col': Parse error. The value is a negative integer indicating the
        character position in the line where the parse error occured.

    *   `0': OK

    *   `col': Missing data: need to feed next line to fill remining
        columns. The value is the character position of the column where
        data is expected.

  `get_first_line_re()'
    Returns a regular expression that matches the first line of a "logical
    line" of data.

      my $re = $fmt->get_first_line_re();

  `get_continue_line_re()'
    Returns a regular expression that matches the 2nd line and the following
    lines of a "logical line".

      my $re = $fmt->get_continue_line_re();

    Returns undef if the format specification does not contains any column
    that can be splitted on multiples lines.

TODO
    *   `format()'

    *   `to_sprintf()'

    *   See TODO sections in tests bundled with the distribution.

BUGS
    *   This module should have been named Text::FixedLengthMultilineFormat,
        but the current name is already long enough!
