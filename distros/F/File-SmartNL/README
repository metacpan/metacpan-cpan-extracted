NAME
    File::SmartNL - slurp text files no matter the New Line (NL) sequence

SYNOPSIS
     #####
     # Subroutine Interface
     #
     use File::SmartNL qw(config fin fout smartnl);

     $old_value = config( $option );
     $old_value = config( $option => $new_value);
     (@all_options) = config( );

     $data          = smart_nl($data);
     $data          = fin( $file_name, @options );
     $char_count    = fout($file_name, $data, @options);

     ######
     # Object Interface
     # 
     use File::SmartNL;

     $default_options = File::SmartNL->default(@options);

     $old_value = $default_options->config( $option );
     $old_value = $default_options->config( $option => $new_value);
     (@all_options) = $default_options->config( );

     $data          = File::SmartNL->smart_nl($data);
     $data          = File::SmartNL->fin( $file_name, @options );
     $char_count    = File::SmartNL->fout($file_name, $data, @options);

    Generally, if a subroutine will process a list of options, "@options",
    that subroutine will also process an array reference, "\@options",
    "[@options]", or hash reference, "\%options", "{@options}". If a
    subroutine will process an array reference, "\@options", "[@options]",
    that subroutine will also process a hash reference, "\%options",
    "{@options}". See the description for a subroutine for details and
    exceptions.

DESCRIPTION
    Different operating systems have different sequences for new-lines.
    Historically when computers where first being born, one of the mainstays
    was the teletype. The teletype understood ASCII. The teletype was an
    automated typewriter that would perform a carriage return when it
    received an ASCII Carriage Return (CR), \015, character and a new line
    when it received a Line Feed (LF), \012 character.

    After some time came Unix. Unix had a tty driver that had a raw mode
    that sent data unprocessed to a teletype and a cooked mode that
    performed all kinds of translations and manipulations. Unix stored data
    internally using a single NL character at the ends of lines. The tty
    driver in the cooked mode would translate the New Line (NL) character to
    a CR,LF sequence. When driving a teletype, the physicall action of
    performing a carriage return took some time. By always putting the CR
    before the LF, the teletype would actually still be performing a
    carriage return when it received the LF and started a line feed.

    After some time came DOS. Since the tty driver is actually one of the
    largest peices of code for UNIX and DOS needed to run in very cramp
    space, the DOS designers decided, that instead of writing a tailored
    down tty driver, they would stored a CR,LF in the internal memory. Data
    internally would be either 'text' data or 'binary' data.

    Needless to say, after many years and many operating systems about every
    conceivable method of storing new lines may be found amoung the various
    operating systems. This greatly complicates moving files from one
    operating system to another operating system.

    The smart NL methods in this package are designed to take any
    combination of CR and NL and translate it into the special NL seqeunce
    used on the site operating system. Thus, by using these methods, the
    messy problem of moving files between operating systems is mostly hidden
    in these methods. By using the "fin" and "fout" methods, text files may
    be freely exchanged between operating systems without any other
    processing.

    The one thing not hidden is that the methods need to know if the data is
    'text' data or 'binary' data. Normally, the assume the data is 'text'
    and are overriden by setting the 'binary' option.

    Perl 5.6 introduced a built-in smart nl functionality as an IO
    discipline :crlf. See *Programming Perl* by Larry Wall, Tom Christiansen
    and Jon Orwant, page 754, Chapter 29: Functions, open function. For Perl
    5.6 or above, the :crlf IO discipline my be preferable over the smart_nl
    method of this program module.

SUBROUTINES
  config

     $old_value = config( $option );
     $old_value = config( $option => $new_value);
     (@all_options) = config( );

    When Perl loads the "File::SmartNL" program module, Perl creates a
    "$File::Drawing::default_options" object using the "default" method.

    Using the "config" as a subroutine

     config(@_) 

    writes and reads the "$File::Drawing::default_options" object directly
    using the Data::Startup::config method. Avoided the "config" and in
    multi-threaded environments where separate threads are using
    "File::Drawing". All other subroutines are multi-thread safe. They use
    "override" to obtain a copy of the "$File::Drawing::default_options" and
    apply any option changes to the copy keeping the original intact.

    Using the "config" as a method,

     $options->config(@_)

    writes and reads the "$options" object using the Data::Startup::config
    method. It goes without saying that that object should have been created
    using one of the following or equivalent:

     $default_options = $class->File::Drawing::defaults(@_);

    The underlying object data for the "File::SmartNL" class of objects is a
    hash. For object oriented conservative purist, the "config" subroutine
    is the accessor function for the underlying object hash.

    Since the data are all options whose names and usage is frozen as part
    of the "File::Drawing" interface, the more liberal minded, may avoid the
    "config" accessor function layer, and access the object data directly.

  defaults

    The "defaults" subroutine establish "File::Drawing" class wide options
    options as follows:

     option                  initial value
     --------------------------------------------
     warn                      1
     binary                    0

  fin

     $data = fin( $file_name )
     $data = fin( $file_name, @options )
     $data = fin( $file_name, [@options] )
     $data = fin( $file_name, {@options} )

    For the "binary" option, the "fin" subroutine reads "$data" from the
    "$file_name" as it; otherwise, it converts any CR LF sequence to the the
    logical Perl "\n" character for site.

  fout

     $success = fout($file_name, $data)
     $success = fout($file_name, $data, @options)
     $success = fout($file_name, $data, [@options])
     $success = fout($file_name, $data, {@options})

    For the "binary" option, the "fout" subroutine writes out the "$data" to
    the "$file_name" as it; otherwise, it converts the logical Perl "\n"
    character to th site CR LF sequence for a NL.

  smart_nl

      $data = smart_nl( $data  )

    The "smart_nl" subroutine converts any combination of CR and LF to the
    NL of the site operationg system.

QUALITY ASSURANCE
    Running the test script "SmartNL.t" verifies the requirements for this
    module. The "tmake.pl" cover script for Test::STDmaker automatically
    generated the "SmartNL.t" test script, "SmartNL.d" demo script, and
    "t::File::SmartNL" STD program module POD, from the "t::File::SmartNL"
    program module contents. The "tmake.pl" cover script automatically ran
    the "SmartNL.d" demo script and inserted the results into the
    'DEMONSTRATION' section above. The "t::File::SmartNL" program module is
    in the distribution file File-SmartNL-$VERSION.tar.gz.

1.0 SCOPE
    This paragraph identifies and provides an overview of the released
    files.

  1.1 Identification

    This release, identified in 3.2, is a collection of Perl modules that
    extend the capabilities of the Perl language.

  1.2 System overview

    Different operating systems have different sequences for new-lines.
    Historically when computers where first being born, one of the mainstays
    was the teletype. The teletype understood ASCII. The teletype was an
    automated typewriter that would perform a carriage return when it
    received an ASCII Carriage Return (CR), \015, character and a new line
    when it received a Line Feed (LF), \012 character.

    After some time came Unix. Unix had a tty driver that had a raw mode
    that sent data unprocessed to a teletype and a cooked mode that
    performed all kinds of translations and manipulations. Unix stored data
    internally using a single NL character at the ends of lines. The tty
    driver in the cooked mode would translate the NL character to a CR,LF
    sequence. When driving a teletype, the physicall action of performing a
    carriage return took some time. By always putting the CR before the LF,
    the teletype would actually still be performing a carriage return when
    it received the LF and started a line feed.

    After some time came DOS. Since the tty driver is actually one of the
    largest peices of code for UNIX and DOS needed to run in very cramp
    space, the DOS designers decided, that instead of writing a tailored
    down tty driver, they would stored a CR,LF in the internal memory. Data
    internally would be either 'text' data or 'binary' data.

    Needless to say, after many years and many operating systems about every
    conceivable method of storing new lines may be found amoung the various
    operating systems. This greatly complicates moving files from one
    operating system to another operating system.

    The smart NL methods in this package are designed to take any
    combination of CR and NL and translate it into the special NL seqeunce
    used on the site operating system. Thus, by using these methods, the
    messy problem of moving files between operating systems is mostly hidden

    know if the data is 'text' data or 'binary' data. Normally, the assume
    the data is 'text' and are overriden by setting the 'binary' option.

    Note that Perl 5.6 introduced a built-in smart nl functionality as an IO
    discipline :crlf. See *Programming Perl* by Larry Wall, Tom Christiansen
    and Jon Orwant, page 754, Chapter 29: Functions, open function. For Perl
    5.6 or above, the :crlf IO discipline may be preferable over the
    smart_nl method of this package. However, when moving code from one
    operating system to another system, there will be target operating
    systems for the near and probable far future that have not upgraded to
    Perl 5.6.

        This error is troublesome since the test passed on my system using
        Active Perl under Microsoft NT. It should never have passed. This
        error is in a core method, *fspec2fspec*, that changes file
        specifications from one operating system to another operating
        system. This method has been in service unchanged for some time.

        The *pm2datah* method is not returning any data for Test 18. This
        will also cause the test of *pm2data*, test 19 to fail. The
        *pm2datah* is searching for the string "\n__DATA__\n".

        The "\n" character on Perl is a logical end of line character
        sequence. The "\n" end of line is different on Mr. Smokehouse's Unix
        operating system than on my Windows NT operating system. The test
        file was created under MSWin32 and uses a MSWin32 "\n". Under UNIX,
        *pm2datah* method will look for the Unix "\n" and there will not be
        any.

        Changed "\n__DATA__\n" to /[\012\015]__DATA__/.

        During the clean-up for CPAN, broke the *format_hash_table* method
        for tables in hash of hash format. Fixed the break, added test 29 to
        the *t/Test/TestUtil/TestUtil.t* test script for this feature, and
        added a discusssion of this feature in POD discription for
        *format_hash_table*

        What we have before, was a totally "failure to communicate." aka
        Cool Hand Luke. VAR1 was empty. Now VAR1 has something. It is not
        completely dead. One probable cause is the Unix operating system
        must be producing two Unix \012 new lines for a Microsoft single
        newline \015\012. Without being able to examine the test with a
        debugger, the only way to verify this is to provide the fix and see
        if the problem goes away when this great group of testers try for
        the fourth time.

        Revised *fin* method to take a handle, change *pm2datah* method
        handle, *$fh*, to binary by adding a *binmode $fh* statement, and
        pass the actual thru the *fin* method for test 18.

        Use *fin($fh)* to read in the data for *pm2data*, test 19 Unit Under
        Test (UUT), instead of using the raw file handle.

        The *fin* method takes any \015\012 combination and changes it into
        the logical Perl new line, *"\n"*, for the current operating system.

            that I would like you to reconsider is the naming of
            "Test::TestUtil" respectively "Test::Tech" - neither of those is
            descriptive of what the routines actually do or what the module
            implements. I would recommend renaming them to something closer
            to your other modules, maybe "Test::SVDMaker::Util" and
            "Test::SVDMaker::Tech", as some routines do not seem to be
            specific to the Test::-suite but rather general
            (format_array_table). Some parts (the "scrub" routines) might
            even better live in another module namespace,
            "Test::Util::ScrubData" or something like that.

            Broke away all the file related methods from Test::TestUtil and
            created this module File::FileUtil so the module name is more
            descriptive of the methods within the module.

        *   Broke the smart nl code out of the fin method and made it is own

            now :-))

            The only place where I see Perl does smart newline handling is
            the crlf IO displine introduce in Perl 5.6. The File::FileUtil
            has a use 5.001 so that 5.6 Perl built-ins cannot be used. Added
            comment to smart_nl that for users with 5.6 Perl that it may be
            better to use the built-in crlf IO discipline.

        *   For the load_package method that uses a eval "require $package"
            to load the package, the $@ does not capture all the warnings
            and error messages, at least not with ActiveState Perl. Added
            code the captures also the warnings, by temporaily reassigning
            $SIG(__WARN__), and added these to the $@ error messages.

        *   Added two new tests to verify the NOGO paths for the for the
            load_package method. One tests for load module failure looking
            for all the possilbe information on why the module did not load.
            The other verifies that the vocabulary is present after the
            loading the module. This information is very helpful when you
            must remote debug a load failure from CPAN testing whose is
            running on a different platform.

    File:-FileUtil-0.02
        Added the method *hex_dump*.

    File-FileUtil-0.03
        test_lib2inc
            Returns to parent directory of the first t directory going up
            from the test script instead of the t directory.

        find_t_roots
            Added the function find_t_roots that returns the parent
            directory of all the directories in @INC

    File-SmartNL-0.01
        Removed the methods for addressing the different CR LF combinations
        for NL between operating systems from the "File::FileUtil" module to
        their own module "File::SmartNL" module. The module name is now much
        more descriptive of the routines in the module.

    File-SmartNL-0.02
        Removed the dump_hex method. This was a quite diagnostic. If need to
        permanently dump_hex, use the "Data::HexDump" or the
        "Data::Hexdumper" module.

    File-SmartNL-0.03
        Change the test so that test support program modules resides in
        distribution directory tlib directory instead of the lib directory.
        Because they are no longer in the lib directory, test support files
        will not be installed as a pre-condition for the test of this
        module. The test of this module will precede immediately. The test
        support files in the tlib directory will vanish after the
        installtion.

    File-SmartNL-0.04
        The lastest build of Test::STDmaker expects the test library in the
        same directory as the test script. Coordiated with the lastest
        Test::STDmaker by moving the test library from tlib to t/File, the
        same directory as the test script and deleting the test library
        File::TestPath program module.

        Added better option support by using the "Data::Startup" program
        module.

        Added a subroutine interface.

    File-SmartNL-0.05
        Better test for a file handle. Do not close a file handle.

        Changed "$options-"warn>, function, to "$options-"{warn}>, a value.

  3.7 Possible problems and known errors

    There is still much work needed to ensure the quality of this module as
    follows:

    *   State the functional requirements for each method including not only
        the GO paths but also what to expect for the NOGO paths

    *   All the tests are GO path tests. Should add NOGO tests.

    *   Add the requirements addressed as *# R: * comment to the tests
