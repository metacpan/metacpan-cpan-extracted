0.04  2007-10-31

- One of these days I will learn how to release a module. This should
  fix the regressing version problem for real.


0.03  2007-10-31

- I'd really like to smack myself for making module versions based on
  CVS revision numbers.


0.02  2007-10-31

- Just bringing the packaging and tests up to modern standards. I
  don't really think any sane person should use this module.


0.01  2001-11-22

- Initial release.  This seems to work but is considered quite alpha.
  Hopefully, people will start using it and I can improve it based on
  user feedback.
