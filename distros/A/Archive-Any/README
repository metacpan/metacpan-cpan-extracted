SYNOPSIS

        use Archive::Any;
    
        my $archive = Archive::Any->new( $archive_file );
    
        my @files = $archive->files;
    
        $archive->extract;
    
        my $type = $archive->type;
    
        $archive->is_impolite;

DESCRIPTION

    This module is a single interface for manipulating different archive
    formats. Tarballs, zip files, etc.

    new

          my $archive = Archive::Any->new( $archive_file );
          my $archive = Archive::Any->new( $archive_file, $type );

      $type is optional. It lets you force the file type in case
      Archive::Any can't figure it out.

    extract

          $archive->extract;
          $archive->extract( $directory );

      Extracts the files in the archive to the given $directory. If no
      $directory is given, it will go into the current working directory.

    files

          my @file = $archive->files;

      A list of files in the archive.

    mime_type

          my $mime_type = $archive->mime_type();

      Returns the mime type of the archive.

    is_impolite

          my $is_impolite = $archive->is_impolite;

      Checks to see if this archive is going to unpack into the current
      directory rather than create its own.

    is_naughty

          my $is_naughty = $archive->is_naughty;

      Checks to see if this archive is going to unpack outside the current
      directory.

DEPRECATED

    type

          my $type = $archive->type;

      Returns the type of archive. This method is provided for backwards
      compatibility in the Tar and Zip plugins and will be going away soon
      in favor of mime_type.
