Revision history for Perl extension Inline::Java
------------------------------------------------
0.53  Sun Jan  9 08:15:06 EST 2011
    - Removed PerlNatives extension from the build because it is unmaintained and broken.
      It can still be enabled manually using the BUILD_PERL_NATIVES build configuration 
      option.
    - Improved automatic casting.
    - Fix with get_source_dir() using the DEBUGGER option. Thanks to Paul Frantz for the fix.
    - Other minor bug and doc fixes.

0.52  Sun Dec 17 20:46:51 EST 2006
    - Fixed JNI on cygwin (many thanks to Eric Rybski for the patch)
    - Improved installation. 'make java' is now performed automatically.
    - Fixed problems with disappearing exceptions by localizing $@.
    - Other minor bug fixes

0.51  Tue May 23 20:40:07 EDT 2006
    - Several major speed optimizations.
    - Introduction of support for I/O mapping between Perl and Java (Inline::Java::Handle)
    - Applied patches by Andrew Bruno and Tim Bunce for MAC OSX
    - JNI fix for system property passing
        (thanks to Brian Gugliemetti and Jason Stelzer)
    - Added NATIVE_DOUBLES configuration option to avoid loss of precision
      when passing double values between Perl and Java
    - New interface for processing callbacks from java to perl.
    - Added support for java.lang.CharSequence as a primitive type. Any
      Perl scalar passed as a java.lang.CharSequence will instantiate
      a java.lang.String on the Java side
    - Added BUILD_JNI, BUILD_PERL_NATIVES, BUILD_PERL_INTERPRETER and JVM_LIB_TYPE build 
      configuration options to help with automated builds
    - Added BIND configuration option. See docs for details. 
      Note: The Java JVM server noe listens on localhost by default (instead of 0.0.0.0).
    - Other minor bug fixes

0.50  Mon Jan 31 20:14:43 EST 2005
    - Added HOST configuration option to access JVM server remotely
    - Fixed bug with paths in Cygwin

    - Extended InlineJavaClassLoader from current thread ClassLoader to enable it to work
      properly under Tomcat
    - Include patch by Ihab Awad that allows running the JVM server inside Tomcat
    - Fixed bug with longs over 32 bits in length and loosened boundary checking in numeric values
      since it was not portable
    - Fixed bug (found by Dean Thayer) with socket not closed properly in Java
    - Other minor bug fixes

0.49  
    - Added PerlInterpreter: require/eval Perl code directly from Java

    - Fixed bugs in portability code and added HPUX, AIX and Solaris specifics
    - Tweaked CLASSPATH directory order
	- Changed port numbers for SHARED_JVM tests in order to avoid clashes
      with running installations
    - Made PerlNatives optional
    
0.46  Web Feb 04 20:00:00 EST 2004
    - Fixed Natives.xs to work with ExtUtils::ParseXS

0.45  Fri Jan 30 20:00:00 EST 2004
    - Fixed Makefile.PL arguments that were getting lost
    - Fixed deprecated require call
    - Fixed support for symbolic links in J2SDK directory
    - Basic support for J2SDK 1.5
    - Added new experimental feature: PerlNatives

0.44  Sun Nov 23 15:47:06 EST 2003
    - Callbacks from multiple threads are now supported
    - Refactored (again...) studying/.jdat/cache stuff
    - Added PRIVATE mode for use with SHARED_JVM
    - Added DEBUGGER mode that launches jdb
    - Fixed memory leak in JNI code (patch submitted by Dave Blob)

0.43  Tue Oct 14 13:18:25 EDT 2003
    - Restored $VERSION in each .pm file
    - Inline::Java now formerly requires Perl 5.6

0.42  Fri Sep  5 13:18:25 EDT 2003
    - Fixed more CLASSPATH issues. CLASSPATH now works like this:
      * CLASSPATH environment variable is global
      * CLASSPATH configuration option is local to the user class loader
    - Added method cache to increase performance and decrease reflection 
      API calls
    - Altered and documented the study_classes() function
    - Added EXTRA_JAVA_ARGS and EXTRA_JAVAC_ARGS config options

0.41  Mon Jul 14 13:18:25 EDT 2003
    - Fixed CLASSPATH bug
    - Possibly (!) fixed test suite problems under heavy load

0.40  Fri Apr 11 11:00:00 EST 2003
    - Patch by Doug MacEachern to allow running under servlet engines.
    - Patch by John Kinsley for handling empty arrays.
    - Custom ClassLoader allows for better isolation of user code and
      dynamic 'CLASSPATH' (multiple sections/clients are now totally
      independant).
    - Core Java code is now compiled separately (at install time) instead
      of with the user code (for each script). This dramatically improves
      build time.
    - Default port number changed to 0 (next available port number). 
      This allows many multiple users to run concurrently without 
      clashes.
      Note: The default port on systems where this feature is not 
            available has remained 7890.
      Note: The default port for SHARED_JVM mode is now 7891.
    - SHARED_JVM mode now calls release_JVM() automatically.
    - UTF8 support
    - User code can now be a public class and (optionally) inside a package.
    - Callback classes have changed.
      Note: These classes are now in the org.perl.inline.java package.
      Note: PerlException has been renamed InlineJavaPerlException.
      Note: If you presently use callbacks, your code may now no longer compile.
            You will need to apply the changes listed above to fix it.
    - study_classes now returns the package in which the studied classes
	  have been put.
    - Many bug fixes and documentation corrections.

    - Added 'studying' of external Java classes
    - Added support for default no-arg constructors for public classes
