0.10    2016/05/23 17:32:10
        [CHANGES]
         * Added 'include_path' and 'define' options for configuring the
           compiler

0.09    CHANGES:
         * Allow member elements to be constants, which don't consume an input
           value or return one

        BUGFIXES:
         * Specify 'signed char' in test.h to be specific to compilers (RT87583)

0.08    CHANGES:
         * Unpack functions now print the actual as well as expected length on
           failures
         * Updated FSF address in LICENSE file

0.07    CHANGES:
         * Allow constants and structures to be guarded by #ifdef preprocessor

        BUGFIXES:
         * Avoid C99's %zu and %td printf(3) formats

0.06    BUGFIXES:
         * Accept member names containing '.'
         * gen_output() before opening the output file in case it fails
         * Ensure warning-free handling of __unpack_u64 when given empty
           string, in case of no_length_check

0.05    CHANGES:
         * Emulate pack/unpack 'Q' on 32bit perls to allow use of 64bit fields

        BUGFIXES:
         * Don't declare Test::Output as a dependency since it isn't required

0.04    CHANGES:
         * Allow member elements to be character arrays
         * Allow generation of pack/unpack functions that use a hashref for
           values, rather than a plain list

0.03    CHANGES:
         * Avoid warning about comparing unsigned int < 0
         * Removed evil action-at-a-distance END{} block; now users must call
           write_output()
         * Try to use Module::Build's configuration if present - useful for
           include_dirs, extra_compiler_flags, extra_linker_flags

0.02    CHANGES:
         * Allow structures to have a data tail; extra bytes at the end
         * Allow renaming of generated constant functions
        
        BUGFIXES:
         * Cast struct member pointers to char* so ptrdiff_t actually makes
           sense
         * Use the correct printf format specifiers for ptrdiff_t and size_t

0.01    First version, released on an unsuspecting world.
