NAME
    Log::Contextual::LogDispatchouli - A Log::Dispatchouli specific wrapper
    for Log::Contextual

VERSION
    version 0.001000

DESCRIPTION
    "Log::Dispatchouli" doesn't need much to get it to work with
    "Log::Contextual" however, it has one teeny annoying quirk in that its
    stack traces are always off by one.

    Which has two primary side effects:

    1. Under "Log::Contextual", it shows errors coming from "LC", not "LC"'s
    caller ( Useless )
    2. Under "Moose", if you use a delegation, "LD" will report problems
    coming from the delegate ( Useless )

    So this module exists to solve #2, and it has to solve #1 in the
    process.

METHODS
  "router"
    This is the only difference this module has from "Log::Contextual", and
    its that it returns a "Log::Contextual::Router::LogDispatchouli" instead
    of the default router.

USAGE
        use Log::Contextual::LogDispatchouli qw( set_logger );

        set_logger $ld;

    Other than that, this module is just a wrapper around the rest of
    "Log::Contextual"
