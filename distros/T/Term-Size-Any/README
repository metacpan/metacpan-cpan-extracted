NAME
    Term::Size::Any - Retrieve terminal size

SYNOPSIS
        # the traditional way
        use Term::Size::Any qw( chars pixels );

        ($columns, $rows) = chars *STDOUT{IO};
        ($x, $y) = pixels;

DESCRIPTION
    This is a unified interface to retrieve terminal size. It loads one
    module of a list of known alternatives, each implementing some way to
    get the desired terminal information. This loaded module will actually
    do the job on behalf of `Term::Size::Any'.

    Thus, `Term::Size::Any' depends on the availability of one of these
    modules:

        Term::Size           (soon to be supported)
        Term::Size::Perl
        Term::Size::ReadKey  (soon to be supported)
        Term::Size::Win32

    This release fallbacks to Term::Size::Win32 if running in Windows 32
    systems. For other platforms, it uses the first of Term::Size::Perl,
    Term::Size or Term::Size::ReadKey which loads successfully. (To be
    honest, I disabled the fallback to Term::Size and Term::Size::ReadKey
    which are buggy by now.)

  FUNCTIONS

    The traditional interface is by importing functions `chars' and `pixels'
    into the caller's space.

    chars
            ($columns, $rows) = chars($h);
            $columns = chars($h);

        `chars' returns the terminal size in units of characters
        corresponding to the given filehandle `$h'. If the argument is
        ommitted, `*STDIN{IO}' is used. In scalar context, it returns the
        terminal width.

    pixels
            ($x, $y) = pixels($h);
            $x = pixels($h);

        `pixels' returns the terminal size in units of pixels corresponding
        to the given filehandle `$h'. If the argument is ommitted,
        `*STDIN{IO}' is used. In scalar context, it returns the terminal
        width.

        Many systems with character-only terminals will return `(0, 0)'.
