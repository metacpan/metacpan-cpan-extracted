NAME
    Random::Any - Try to use Data::Entropy::Algorithms::rand(), fallback on
    builtin rand()

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.006 of Random::Any (from Perl
    distribution Random-Any), released on 2026-01-20.

SYNOPSIS
     use Random::Any qw(rand);

     say rand();

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides a single export rand() that tries to use
    Data::Entropy::Algorithms's rand() first and, if that module is not
    available, warns to STDERR and falls back on the builtin rand().

    Note that whenever you can you are encouraged to use rand_int() or
    random_int(), or rand_flt() or random_float() function instead. From
    "Data::Entropy::Algorithms"' documentation:

    "This function should not be used in any new code, because the kind of
    output supplied by "rand" is hardly ever the right thing to use. The
    "int(rand($n))" idiom to generate a random integer has non-uniform
    probabilities of generating each possible value, except when $n is a
    power of two. For floating point numbers, "rand" can't generate most
    representable numbers in its output range, and the output is biased
    towards zero. In new code use "rand_int" to generate integers and
    "rand_flt" to generate floating point numbers."

    Also, take a look at Random::Simple instead of this module.

EXPORTS
  -warn => bool
    If true (the default) then emit a warning if Data::Entropy::Algorithms
    is not available. To disable this warning, set to false.

FUNCTIONS
  rand
ENVIRONMENT
  PERL_RANDOM_ANY_WARN
    Bool. Can be set to provide default value for "-warn".

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR,
    Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps
    required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
