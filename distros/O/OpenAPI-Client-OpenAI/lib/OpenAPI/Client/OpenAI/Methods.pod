=head1 NAME

OpenAPI::Client::OpenAI::Methods - Methods for OpenAI API

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Yes, this isn't perfect. But it's a start. The OpenAI API is complex and and
the L<OpenAPI::Client> module is a bit opaque at times. We'll add more later.

=head1 METHODS


=head2 addUploadPart

Adds a
L<Part|https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/uploads/part-obje
ct> to an
L<Upload|https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/uploads/object>
object. A Part represents a chunk of bytes from the file you are trying
to upload. 

Each Part can be at most 64 MB, and you can add Parts until you hit the
Upload maximum of 8 GB.

It is possible to add multiple Parts in parallel. You can decide the
intended order of the Parts when you L<complete the
Upload|https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/uploads/complete>
.
