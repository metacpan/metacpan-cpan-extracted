    certain circumstances.

        }

METHODS

 form

    This creates a new HTML::FormFu object, passing as it's argument the
    contents of the "constructor" config value.

    This is useful when using the ConfigForm() or MethodForm() action
    attributes, to create a 2nd form which isn't populated using a
    config-file or method return value.

        sub foo : Local {
            my ( $self, $c ) = @_;
    
            my $form = $self->form;
        }

    Note that when using this method, the form's query method is not
    populated with the Catalyst request object.

SPECIAL ACTION NAMES

    An example showing how a complicated action method can be broken down
    into smaller sections, making it clearer which code will be run, and
    when.

        sub edit : Local : FormConfig {
            my ( $self, $c ) = @_;
    
            my $form  = $c->stash->{form};
            my $group = $c->stash->{group};
    
            $c->detach('/unauthorised') unless $c->user->can_edit( $group );
    
            if ( $form->submitted_and_valid ) {
                $form->model->update( $group );
    
                $c->response->redirect( $c->uri_for('/group', $group->id ) );
                return;
            }
            elsif ( !$form->submitted ) {
                $form->model->default_values( $group );
            }
    
            $self->_add_breadcrumbs_nav( $c, $group );
        }

    Instead becomes...

        sub edit : Local : FormConfig {
            my ( $self, $c ) = @_;
    
            $c->detach('/unauthorised') unless $c->user->can_edit(
                $c->stash->{group}
            );
        }
    
        sub edit_FORM_VALID {
            my ( $self, $c ) = @_;
    
            my $group = $c->stash->{group};
    
            $c->stash->{form}->model->update( $group );
    
            $c->response->redirect( $c->uri_for('/group', $group->id ) );
        }
    
        sub edit_FORM_NOT_SUBMITTED {
            my ( $self, $c ) = @_;
    
            $c->stash->{form}->model->default_values(
                $c->stash->{group}
            );
        }
    
        sub edit_FORM_RENDER {
            my ( $self, $c ) = @_;
    
            $self->_add_breadcrumbs_nav( $c, $c->stash->{group} );
        }

    For any action method that uses a Form, FormConfig or FormMethod
    attribute, you can add extra methods that use the naming conventions
    below.

    These methods will be called after the original, plainly named action
    method.

 _FORM_VALID

    Run when the form has been submitted and has no errors.

 _FORM_SUBMITTED

    Run when the form has been submitted, regardless of whether or not
    there was errors.

 _FORM_COMPLETE

    For MultiForms, is run if the MultiForm is completed.

 _FORM_NOT_VALID

    Run when the form has been submitted and there were errors.

 _FORM_NOT_SUBMITTED

    Run when the form has not been submitted.

 _FORM_NOT_COMPLETE

    For MultiForms, is run if the MultiForm is not completed.

 _FORM_RENDER

    For normal Form base classes, this subroutine is run after any of the
    other special methods, unless $form->submitted_and_valid is true.

    For MultiForm base classes, this subroutine is run after any of the
    other special methods, unless $multi->complete is true.

CUSTOMIZATION

    You can set your own config settings, using either your controller
    config or your application config.

        $c->config( 'Controller::HTML::FormFu' => \%my_values );
    
        # or
    
        MyApp->config( 'Controller::HTML::FormFu' => \%my_values );
    
        # or, in myapp.conf
    
        <Controller::HTML::FormFu>
            default_action_use_path 1
        </Controller::HTML::FormFu>

 form_method

    Override the method-name used to create a new form object.

    See "form".

    Default value: form.

 form_stash

    Sets the stash key name used to store the form object.

    Default value: form.

 form_attr

    Sets the attribute name used to load the
    Catalyst::Controller::HTML::FormFu::Action::Form action.

    Default value: Form.

 config_attr

    Sets the attribute name used to load the
    Catalyst::Controller::HTML::FormFu::Action::Config action.

    Default value: FormConfig.

 method_attr

    Sets the attribute name used to load the
    Catalyst::Controller::HTML::FormFu::Action::Method action.

    Default value: FormMethod.

 form_action

    Sets which package will be used by the Form() action.

    Probably only useful if you want to create a sub-class which provides
    custom behaviour.

    Default value: Catalyst::Controller::HTML::FormFu::Action::Form.

 config_action

    Sets which package will be used by the Config() action.

    Probably only useful if you want to create a sub-class which provides
    custom behaviour.

    Default value: Catalyst::Controller::HTML::FormFu::Action::Config.

 method_action

    Sets which package will be used by the Method() action.

    Probably only useful if you want to create a sub-class which provides
    custom behaviour.

    Default value: Catalyst::Controller::HTML::FormFu::Action::Method.

 constructor

    Pass common defaults to the HTML::FormFu constructor.

    These values are used by all of the action attributes, and by the
    $self->form method.

    Default value: {}.

 config_callback

    Arguments: bool

    If true, a coderef is passed to $form->config_callback->{plain_value}
    which replaces any instance of __uri_for(URI)__ found in form config
    files with the result of passing the URI argument to "uri_for" in
    Catalyst.

    The form __uri_for(URI, PATH, PARTS)__ is also supported, which is
    equivalent to $c->uri_for( 'URI', \@ARGS ). At this time, there is no
    way to pass query values equivalent to $c->uri_for( 'URI', \@ARGS,
    \%QUERY_VALUES ).

    The second codeword that is being replaced is __path_to( @DIRS )__. Any
    instance is replaced with the result of passing the DIRS arguments to
    "path_to" in Catalyst. Don't use qoutationmarks as they would become
    part of the path.

    Default value: 1

 default_action_use_name

    If set to a true value the action for the form will be set to the
    currently called action name.

    Default value: false.

 default_action_use_path

    If set to a true value the action for the form will be set to the
    currently called action path. The action path includes concurrent to
    action name additioal parameters which were code inside the path.

    Default value: false.

    Example:

        action: /foo/bar
        called uri contains: /foo/bar/1
    
        # default_action_use_name => 1 leads to:
        $form->action = /foo/bar
    
        # default_action_use_path => 1 leads to:
        $form->action = /foo/bar/1

 model_stash

    Arguments: \%stash_keys_to_model_names

    Used to place Catalyst models on the form stash.

    If it's being used to make a DBIx::Class schema available for
    "options_from_model" in HTML::FormFu::Model::DBIC, for Select and other
    Group-type elements - then the hash-key must be schema. For example, if
    your schema model class is MyApp::Model::MySchema, you would set
    model_stash like so:

        <Controller::HTML::FormFu>
            <model_stash>
                schema MySchema
            </model_stash>
        </Controller::HTML::FormFu>

 context_stash

    To allow your form validation packages, etc, access to the catalyst
    context, a weakened reference of the context is copied into the form's
    stash.

        $form->stash->{context};

    This setting allows you to change the key name used in the form stash.

    Default value: context

 languages_from_context

    If you're using a L10N / I18N plugin such as Catalyst::Plugin::I18N
    which provides a languages method that returns a list of valid
    languages to use for the currect request - and you want to use formfu's
    built-in I18N packages, then setting "languages_from_context"

 localize_from_context

    If you're using a L10N / I18N plugin such as Catalyst::Plugin::I18N
    which provides it's own localize method, you can set
    localize_from_context to use that method for formfu's localization.

 request_token_enable

    If true, adds an instance of HTML::FormFu::Plugin::RequestToken to
    every form, to stop accidental double-submissions of data and to
    prevent CSRF attacks.

 request_token_field_name

    Defaults to _token.

 request_token_session_key

    Defaults to __token.

 request_token_expiration_time

    Defaults to 3600.

DISCONTINUED CONFIG SETTINGS

 config_file_ext

    Support for this has now been removed. Config files are now searched
    for, with any file extension supported by Config::Any.

 config_file_path

    Support for this has now been removed. Use
    {constructor}{config_file_path} instead.

CAVEATS

    When using the Form action attribute to create an empty form, you must
    call $form->process after populating the form. However, you don't need
    to pass any arguments to process, as the Catalyst request object will
    have automatically been set in $form->query.

    When using the FormConfig and FormMethod action attributes, if you make
    any modifications to the form, such as adding or changing it's
    elements, you must call $form->process before rendering the form.
