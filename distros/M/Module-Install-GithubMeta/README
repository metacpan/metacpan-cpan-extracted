NAME
    Module::Install::GithubMeta - A Module::Install extension to include
    GitHub meta information in META.yml

SYNOPSIS
      # In Makefile.PL

      use inc::Module::Install;
      githubmeta;

    The "repository" and "homepage" meta in "META.yml" will be set
    accordingly.

DESCRIPTION
    Module::Install::GithubMeta is a Module::Install extension to include
    GitHub <http://github.com> meta information in "META.yml".

    It automatically detects if the distribution directory is under "git"
    version control and whether the "origin" is a GitHub repository and will
    set the "repository" and "homepage" meta in "META.yml" to the
    appropriate URLs for GitHub.

COMMANDS
    This plugin adds the following Module::Install command:

    "githubmeta"
        Does nothing on the user-side. On the author-side it will
        auto-detect if the directory is under "git" version control and
        whether the "origin" is a GitHub repository. Will set "repository"
        to the public clone URL and "homepage" to the http GitHub link for
        the repository.

        You may optionally provide the remote to query, this defaults to
        "origin" if not specified.

        You may override the "homepage" setting by using the Module::Install
        "homepage" command prior to calling this command.

          use inc::Module::Install;
          homepage 'http://mymoduleshomepage.com/';
          githubmeta;
