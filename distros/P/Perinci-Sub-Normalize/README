FUNCTIONS
  normalize_function_metadata($meta[ , \%opts ]) => HASH
    Normalize and check Rinci function metadata $meta. Return normalized
    metadata, which is a shallow copy of $meta. Die on error.

    Available options:

    *   allow_unknown_properties => BOOL (default: 0)

        If set to true, will die if there are unknown properties.

    *   normalize_sah_schemas => BOOL (default: 1)

        By default, Sah schemas e.g. in "result/schema" or "args/*/schema"
        property is normalized using Data::Sah's "normalize_schema". Set
        this to 0 if you don't want this.

    *   remove_internal_properties => BOOL (default: 0)

        If set to 1, all properties and attributes starting with underscore
        ("_") with will be stripped. According to DefHash specification,
        they are ignored and usually contain notes/comments/extra
        information.
