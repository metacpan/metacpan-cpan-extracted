Revision history for Perl module Business::US::USPS::WebTools

1.125 2021-05-19
        * Updated API endpoints.  Always use HTTPS.

        * Removed two tests that started failing due to changes in the API
          response.

        * Skip tracking tests (which are disabled anyway) rather than failing if
          test credentials aren't set.

        * Access to the testing/staging environment is no longer granted by
          default and testing against the production environment is allowed
          (load/stress testing isn't), so tests are now run against the
          production API by default.  To run against the testing/staging
          environment, set USPS_WEBTOOLS_ENVIRONMENT to TESTING while setting up
          your credentials.
