=head1 NAME

Forward::Routes - restful routes for web framework developers

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Instead of letting a web server like Apache decide which files to serve based
on the provided URL, the whole work can be done by your framework using the
L<Forward::Routes> module.

Ruby on Rails and Perl's Mojolicious make use of routes. Forward::Routes, in
contrast to that, tries to provide the same or even better functionality
without the tight couplings with a full featured framework.

Think of routes as kind of simplified regular expressions! First of all, a
bunch of routes is defined. Each route contains information on

=over 2

=item *

what kind of URLs to match

=item *

what to do in case of a match

=back

Finally, the request method and path of a users HTTP request are passed to
search for a matching route.


=head2 1. Routes setup

Each route represents a specific URL or a bunch of URLs (if placeholders are
used). The URL path pattern is defined via the C<add_route> command. A route
also contains information on what to do in case of a match. A common use
case is to provide controller and action defaults, so the framework knows
which controller method to execute in case of a match:

    # create a routes root object
    my $routes = Forward::Routes->new;

    # add a new route with a :city placeholder and controller and action defaults
    $routes->add_route('/towns/:city')->defaults(controller => 'World', action => 'cities');

=head2 2. Search for a matching route

After the setup has been done, the method and path of a current HTTP request
can be passed to the routes root object to search for a matching route.

The match method returns an array ref of L<Forward::Routes::Match> objects in
case of a match, or undef if there is no match. Unless advanced techniques
such as bridges are used, the array ref contains no more than one match object
($matches->[0]).

    # get request path and method (e.g. from a Plack::Request object)
    my $path   = $req->path_info;
    my $method = $req->method;

    # search routes
    my $matches = $routes->match($method => $path);

The search ends as soon as a matching route has been found. As a result, if
there are multiple routes that might match, the route that has been defined
first wins.

    # $matches is an array ref of Forward::Routes::Match objects
    my $matches = $routes->match(GET => '/towns/paris');

    # exactly one match object is returned:
    # $match is a Forward::Routes::Match object
    my $match = $matches->[0];

    # $match->params->{controller} is "World"
    # $match->params->{action}     is "cities"
    # $match->params->{city}       is "paris"

Controller and action parameters can be used by your framework to execute the
desired controller method, while making default and placeholder values of the
matching route available to that method for further use.

If the passed path and method do not match against a defined route, an
undefined value is returned. Frameworks might render a 404 not found page in
such cases.

    # $matches is undef
    my $matches = $routes->match(get => '/hello_world');

The match object holds two types of parameters:

=over 2

=item *

default values of the matching route as defined earlier via the "defaults"
method

=item *

placeholder values extracted from the passed URL path

=back


=head1 FEATURES AND METHODS

=head2 Add new routes

The C<add_route> method adds a new route to the parent route object (in simple
use cases, to the routes root object) and returns the new route object.

The passed parameter is the URL path pattern of the new route object. The URL
path pattern is kind of a simplified reqular expression for the path part of a
URL and is transformed to a real regular expression internally. It is used
later on to check whether the passed request path matches the route.

    $root = Forward::Routes->new;
    my $new_route = $root->add_route('foo/bar');

    my $m = $root->match(get => 'foo/bar');
    # $m->[0]->params is {}

    my $m = $r->match(get => 'foo/hello');
    # $m is undef;


=head2 Placeholders

Placeholders start with a colon and match everything except slashes. If the
route matches against the passed request method and path, placeholder values
can be retrieved from the returned match object.

    $r = Forward::Routes->new;
    $r->add_route(':foo/:bar');

    $m = $r->match(get => 'hello/there');
    # $m->[0]->params is {foo => 'hello', bar => 'there'};

    $m = $r->match(get => 'hello/there/you');
    # $m is undef


=head2 Optional Placeholders

Placeholders can be marked as optional by surrounding them with brackets and
a trailing question mark.

    $r = Forward::Routes->new;
    $r->add_route(':year(/:month/:day)?');

    $m = $r->match(get => '2009');
    # $m->[0]->params is {year => 2009}

    $m = $r->match(get => '2009/12');
    # $m is undef

    $m = $r->match(get => '2009/12/10');
    # $m->[0]->params is {year => 2009, month => 12, day => 10}


    $r = Forward::Routes->new;
    $r->add_route('/hello/world(-:city)?');

    $m = $r->match(get => 'hello/world');
    # $m->[0]->params is {}

    $m = $r->match(get => 'hello/world-paris');
    # $m->[0]->params is {city => 'paris'}


=head2 Grouping

Placeholders have to be surrounded with brackets if more than one placeholder
is put between slashes (grouping).

    $r = Forward::Routes->new;
    $r->add_route('world/(:country)-(:cities)');

    $m = $r->match(get => 'world/us-new_york');
    # $m->[0]->params is {country => 'us', cities => 'new_york'}


=head2 Constraints

By default, placeholders match everything except slashes. The C<constraints>
method allows to make placeholders more restrictive. The first passed
parameter is the name of the placeholder, the second parameter is a
Perl regular expression.

    $r = Forward::Routes->new;

    # placeholder only matches integers
    $r->add_route('articles/:id')->constraints(id => qr/\d+/);
    
    $m = $r->match(get => 'articles/abc');
    # $m is undef
    
    $m = $r->match(get => 'articles/123');
    # $m->[0]->params is {id => 123}


=head2 Defaults

The C<defaults> method allows to add default values to a route. If the route
matches against the passed request method and path, default values can be
retrieved from the returned match object.

    $r = Forward::Routes->new;
    $r->add_route('articles')
      ->defaults(first_name => 'Kevin', last_name => 'Smith');

    $m = $r->match(get => 'articles');
    # $m->[0]->params is {first_name => 'Kevin', last_name => 'Smith'}


=head2 Optional Placeholders and Defaults

Placeholders are automatically filled with default values if the route
would not match otherwise.

    $r = Forward::Routes->new;
    $r->add_route(':year(/:month)?/:day')->defaults(month => 1);

    $m = $r->match(get => '2009');
    # $m is undef

    $m = $r->match(get => '2009/12');
    # $m->[0]->params is {year => 2009, month => 1, day => 12}

    $m = $r->match(get => '2009/2/3');
    # $m->[0]->params is {year => 2009, month => 2, day => 3};


=head2 Shortcut for Action and Controller Defaults

The C<to> method provides a shortcut for action and controller defaults.

    $r = Forward::Routes->new;

    $r->add_route('articles')
      ->to('Foo#bar');

    # is a shortcut for
    $r->add_route('articles')
      ->defaults(controller => 'Foo', action => 'bar');

    $m = $r->match(get => 'articles');
    # $m->[0]->params is {controller => 'Foo', action => 'bar'}


=head2 Request Method Constraints

The C<via> method sets the HTTP request method required for a route to match.
If no method is set, the request method has no influence on the search for a
matching route.

    $r = Forward::Routes->new;
    $r->add_route('logout')->via('post');

    my $m = $r->match(get => 'logout');
    # $m is undef
    
    my $m = $r->match(post => 'logout');
    # $m->[0] is {}

All child routes inherit the method constraint of their parent, unless the
method constraint of the child is overwritten.


=head2 Format Constraints

The C<format> method restricts the allowed formats of a URL path. If the route
matches against the passed request method and path, the format value can be
retrieved from the returned match object.

    $r = Forward::Routes->new;
    $r->add_route(':foo/:bar')->format('html','xml');

    $m = $r->match(get => 'hello/there.html');
    # $m->[0]->params is {foo => 'hello', bar => 'there', format => 'html'}

    $m = $r->match(get => 'hello/there.xml');
    # $m->[0]->params is {foo => 'hello', bar => 'there', format => 'xml'}

    $m = $r->match(get => 'hello/there.jpeg');
    # $m is undef


All child routes inherit the format constraint of their parent, unless the
format constraint of the child is overwritten. For example, adding a format
constraint to the route root object affects all child routes added
via add_route.
    
    my $root = Forward::Routes->new->format('html');
    $root->add_route('foo')->format('xml');
    $root->add_route('baz');

    $m = $root->match(get => 'foo.html');
    # $m is undef;
    
    $m = $root->match(get => 'foo.xml');
    # $m->[0]->params is {format => 'xml'};

    $m = $root->match(get => 'baz.html');
    # $m->[0]->params is {format => 'html'};

    $m = $root->match(get => 'baz.xml');
    # $m is undef;

If no format constraint is added to a route and the route's parents also have
no format constraints, there is also no format validation taking place. This
might cause kind of unexpected behaviour when dealing with placeholders:

    $r = Forward::Routes->new;
    $r->add_route(':foo/:bar');

    $m = $r->match(get => 'hello/there.html');
    # $m->[0]->params is {foo => 'hello', bar => 'there.html'}

If this is not what you want, an empty format constraint can be passed explicitly:

    $r = Forward::Routes->new->format('');
    $r->add_route(':foo/:bar');

    $m = $r->match(get => 'hello/there.html');
    # $m->[0] is undef

    $m = $r->match(get => 'hello/there');
    # $m->[0]->params is {foo => 'hello', bar => 'there'}


=head2 Naming

Each route can get a name through the C<name> method. Names are required to
make routes reversible (see C<build_path>).

    $r = Forward::Routes->new;
    $r->add_route('logout')->name('foo');


=head2 Namespaces

The C<app_namespace> method can be used to define the base namespace of your
application. All nested routes inherit the app_namespace, unless it is
overwritten. The app_namespace value is used to determine the full
controller class name.

    my $root = Forward::Routes->new->app_namespace('My::Project');
    $root->add_route('hello')->to('Foo#bar');

    my $matches = $root->match(get => '/hello');
    # $matches->[0]->class is My::Project::Foo
    # $matches->[0]->action is bar

The C<namespace> method can be used to define sub namespaces on top of the app
namespace. All nested routes inherit the (sub) namespace, unless it is
overwritten. The namespace value is used to determine the full controller
class name.

    my $root = Forward::Routes->new->app_namespace('My::Project');
    $root->add_route('hi')->namespace('Greetings')->to('Foo#hi');
    my $matches = $root->match(get => '/hello');
    # $matches->[0]->class is My::Project::Greetings::Foo
    # $matches->[0]->action is "hi"


=head2 Path Building

Routes are reversible, i.e. paths can be generated through the C<build_path>
method. The first parameter is the name of the route. If the route consists of
placeholders which are not optional, placeholder values have to be passed as
well to generate the path, otherwise an exception is thrown.
The C<build_path> method returns a hash ref with the keys "method" and "path".

    $r = Forward::Routes->new;
    $r->add_route('world/(:country)-(:cities)')->name('hello')->via('post');

    my $path = $r->build_path('hello', country => 'us', cities => 'new_york')
    # $path->{path}   is 'world/us-new_york';
    # $path->{method} is 'post';

Path building is useful to build tag helpers that can be used in templates.
For example, a link_to helper might generate a link with the help of a route
name: link_to('route_name', placeholder => 'value'). In contrast to hard
coding the URL in templates, routes could be changed and all links in your
templates would get adjusted automatically.


=head2 Chaining

All methods can be chained.

    $r = Forward::Routes->new;
    my $articles = $r->add_route('articles/:id')
      ->defaults(first_name => 'foo', last_name => 'bar')
      ->format('html')
      ->constraints(id => qr/\d+/)
      ->name('hot')
      ->to('Hello#world')
      ->via('get','post');


=head2 Nested Routes

New routes cannot only be added to the routes root object, but to any route.
Building deep routes trees might result in performance gains in larger
projects with many routes, as the amount of regular expression searches can
be reduced this way.

    # nested routes
    $root = Forward::Routes->new;
    $nested1 = $root->add_route('foo1');
    $nested1->add_route('bar1');
    $nested1->add_route('bar2');
    $nested1->add_route('bar3');
    $nested1->add_route('bar4');
    $nested1->add_route('bar5');

    $nested2 = $root->add_route('foo2');
    $nested2->add_route('bar5');

    $m = $r->match(get => 'foo2/bar5');
    # 3 regular expression searches performed

    # alternative:
    $root = Forward::Routes->new;
    $root->add_route('foo1/bar1');
    $root->add_route('foo1/bar2');
    $root->add_route('foo1/bar3');
    $root->add_route('foo1/bar4');
    $root->add_route('foo1/bar5');
    $root->add_route('foo2/bar5');
    # 6 regular expression searches performed


=head2 Resource Routing

The C<add_resources> method enables Rails like resource routing.

Please look at L<Forward::Guides::Routes::Resources> for more in depth
documentation on resourceful routes.

    $r = Forward::Routes->new;
    $r->add_resources('users', 'photos', 'tags');

    $m = $r->match(get => 'photos');
    # $m->[0]->params is {controller => 'Photos', action => 'index'}

    $m = $r->match(get => 'photos/1');
    # $m->[0]->params is {controller => 'Photos', action => 'show', id => 1}

    $m = $r->match(put => 'photos/1');
    # $m->[0]->params is {controller => 'Photos', action => 'update', id => 1}

    my $path = $r->build_path('photos_update', id => 987)
    # $path->{path} is 'photos/987'
    # $path->{method} is 'put'

Resource routing is quite flexible and offers many options for customization:

documentation on nested resources.

=head2 Bridges

    $r = Forward::Routes->new;
    my $bridge = $r->bridge('admin')->to('Check#authentication');
    $bridge->add_route('foo')->to('My#stuff');

    $m = $r->match(get => 'admin/foo');
    # $m->[0]->params is {controller => 'Check', action => 'authentication'}
    # $m->[1]->params is {controller => 'My', action => 'stuff'}
