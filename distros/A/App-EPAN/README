DESCRIPTION

    This program helps you creating and managing an EPAN - a version of the
    CPAN that is trimmed down to your needs for installing specific stuff.

    To start with an example, suppose you have to install Mojolicious and a
    couple of its plugins in a machine that - for good reasons - is not
    connected to the Internet. It's easy to get the distribution files for
    Dancer and the plugins... but what about the dependencies? It can
    easily become a nightmare, forcing you to go back and forth with new
    modules as soon as you discover the need to install them.

    Thanks to cpanm, this is quite easier these days: it can actually do
    what's needed with a single command:

       # on the machine connected to the Internet or to a minicpan
       $ cpanm -L xxx --scandeps --save-dists dists \
            Mojolicious Mojolicious::Plugin::Authentication IO::Socket::SSL ...

    which places all the modules in subdirectory dists (thanks to option
    --save-dists) with an arrangement similar to what you would expect from
    a CPAN mirror.

    On the target machine, you still have to make some work - e.g. you
    should collect the output from the invocation of cpanm above to figure
    out the order to use for installing the distribution files.
    Additionally, the directory structure that is generated lacks a proper
    index file (located in modules/02package.details.txt.gz) so it would be
    difficult to use the normal toolchain.

    epan aims at filling up the last mile to get the job done, providing
    you with a subdirectory that is ready for deployment, with all the bits
    in place to push automation as much as possible. So you can do this:

       # on the machine connected to the Internet or to a minicpan
       $ epan create Mojolicious Mojolicious::Plugin::Authentication \
           IO::Socket::SSL ...
       $ tar cvzf epan.tar.gz epan

    transfer dists.tar.gz to the target machine and...

       # on the target machine
       $ tar xvzf epan.tar.gz
       $ cd epan
       $ ./install.sh

    optionally providing an installation target directory:

       $ ./install.sh /path/to/local/perl

    The program epan is actually a unified access point to several
    different tools for manipulating your exclusive Perl archive nook. Most
    of these commands operate upon a target directory that is where your
    EPAN is stored; this can be specified via option -t or its longer
    version --target. By default, the target directory is assumed to be
    epan in the current directory.

 add, install and update

    These commands are synonimous in epan, and all help you pull a module
    and its dependencies from a CPAN mirror right into your EPAN,
    regenerating the index at the end of the process. The syntax is:

       epan add # or install or update \
          [-t|--target directory]
          Module1 [Module2...]

    So, in addition to the common option -t for setting the right target
    directory, it accepts a list of module names to install (with their
    dependencies).

 create

    This command is almost the same as add and its aliases, with the
    exception that the target directory MUST NOT already exist when called.

 index

    Regenerate the index so that tools like cpanm are happy about what they
    find and treat your target directory as a real CPAN sort-of mirror. The
    syntax is the following:

       epan index [-t|--target dirname]

    Note that other commands (e.g. add or create) already do the indexing.
    This command can be useful when you have a starting base (i.e. a
    compound of modules coming from CPAN and your own distribution) already
    arranged in the right directory tree, but you need to generate an
    index. For example, this happens when you collect some distribution
    files using cpanm:

       shell$ cpanminus -L xxx --save-dists dists Mod1 Mod2...

    because it saves the needed distributions in dists but it does not
    generate the index. The same happens when using carton.

    In these cases, if you want to prepare a pack of modules to carry with
    your application, you can do like this:

       $ figure_out_modules > modlist
       $ cpanm -L xxx --save-dists dists $(<modlist)
       $ epan index -t dists
       $ tar cvf dists.tar dists

    Well, put like this the second and third lines can just be synthesized
    as:

       $ epan add -t dists $(<modlist)

    but you get the idea. The directory with the modules might be the
    byproduct of invoking carton instead (in which case you would end up
    with a sub-directory cache).

    Anyway, you can then carry dists.tar with you, at which point you can:

       $ cpanm --mirror file://$YOURPATH --mirror-only Mod1 Mod2 ...

    This command expects the target directory to exist and will complain
    otherwise.

 inject

    If you have some local distribution files, e.g. generated by yourself
    and not (yet) uploaded to CPAN, you can inject them into a local EPAN.
    The syntax is straightforward:

       epan inject \ 
          [-a|--author author-name] \
          [-t|--target dirname] File1 [File2...]

    As for many other commands, you can also set the different output
    filenames, but that would be hardly useful.

 list-actions and list_actions

    Prints out the list of available commands.

 list-obsoletes and list_obsoletes

       epan list-obsoletes [-t|--target dirname]

    Prints out a list of obsolete distributions in the EPAN. A distribution
    is considered obsolete if there is a newer corresponding version in the
    EPAN. E.g. suppose that you work on Acme::Whatever and inject version
    0.2:

       epan inject Acme-Whatever-0.2.tar.gz
       # ...

    then you work on it some more time, and inject version 0.3:

       epan inject Acme-Whatever-0.2.tar.gz
       # ...

    Now your EPAN contains two distribution packages for Acme::Whatever,
    one for release 0.2 (which is the obsolete one) and one for the newest
    version 0.3.

 purge-obsoletes and purge_obsoletes

       epan purge-obsoletes [-t|--target dirname]

    Remove (purge) obsolete distribution packages from the EPAN. See above
    for what obsolete means.

OPTIONS

    The following options are supported, even though not all actions use
    them all:

    -1 | -m | --mailrc

      path to the file 01mailrc.txt.gz, defaults to authors/01mailrc.txt.gz
      inside the target directory. You hardly want to change this.

    -2 | -o | --output | --package-details

      path to the file for 02packages.details.txt.gz, defaults to
      modules/02packages.details.txt.gz inside the target directory. Yes,
      you can use - with the usual meaning, although this might not help
      you much.

    -3 | -l | --modlist | --modlist-data

      path to the file 03modlist.data.gz, defaults to
      modules/03modlist.data.gz inside the target directory. You hardly
      want to change this.

    -a | --author author-name

      module author to use when doing injection of local distribution
      packages.

    --help

      print a somewhat more verbose help, showing usage, this description
      of the options and some examples.

    --man

      print out the full documentation for the script.

    -t | --target dirname

      set the directory of the root for the EPAN to work on. Defaults to
      the sub-directory epan in the current directory. This option applies
      to all commands except list-actions.

      The default value is epan as a sub-directory in the current
      directory.

      Some commands demand that the target directory already exists; in
      case it does not, they will complain that you're probably using this
      option in the wrong way (or not using it at all).

    --usage

      print a concise usage line and exit.

    --version

      print the version of the script.

CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT

    epan requires no configuration files. The following environment
    variable is honored:

    EPAN_AUTHOR

      set the name of the pause account to use for indexing. Defaults to
      LOCAL. It is overridden by --author.

DEPENDENCIES

    Runs on perl 5.012, adapt it if you want to run on something older :-)

    The following non-core modules are used:

      * Dist::Metadata

      * Path::Class

      * File::Find::Rule

      * Log::Log4perl::Tiny
