=head1 NAME

cpandak - cpanm, with some sort of distroprefs

=head1 VERSION

version 0.0.2

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    cpandak Foo::Bar

    cpandak --installdeps .

Exactly the same way as C<cpanm>.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a subclass of C<App::cpanminus::script> that wraps some of its
methods to add the ability to apply patches, set environment
variables, and skip tests, to specific distributions.

The idea comes from L<Distroprefs|CPAN/Configuration for individual
distributions (Distroprefs)>.

See L<< /C<App::CpanDak> >> for the actual documentation.
