NAME

    Alien::Build::Plugin::Download::GitHub - Alien::Build plugin to
    download from GitHub

VERSION

    version 0.07

SYNOPSIS

     use alienfile;
    
     ...
    
     share {
     
       plugin 'Download::GitHub' => (
         github_user => 'PerlAlien',
         github_repo => 'dontpanic',
       );
     
     };

DESCRIPTION

    This plugin will download releases from GitHub. It is generally
    preferred over Alien::Build::Plugin::Download::Git for packages that
    are released on GitHub, as it has much fewer dependencies and is more
    reliable.

PROPERTIES

 github_user

    The GitHub user or org that owns the repository. This property is
    required.

 github_repo

    The GitHub repository name. This property is required.

 include_assets

    Defaulting to false, this option designates whether to include the
    assets of releases in the list of candidates for download. This should
    be one of three types of values:

    true value

      The full list of assets will be included in the list of candidates.

    false value

      No assets will be included in the list of candidates.

    regular expression

      If a regular expression is provided, this will include assets that
      match by name.

 tags_only

    Boolean value for those repositories that do not upgrade their tags to
    releases. There are two different endpoints. One for releases
    <https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/releases/#list-releases-for-a-repository>
    and one for simple tags
    <https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/#list-tags>. The default is to
    interrogate the former for downloads. Passing a true value for
    "tags_only" interrogates the latter for downloads.

 version

    Regular expression that can be used to extract a version from a GitHub
    tag. The default ( qr/^v?(.*)$/ ) is reasonable for many GitHub
    repositories.

 prefer

    How to sort candidates for selection. This should be one of three types
    of values:

    code reference

      This will be used as the prefer hook.

    true value (not code reference)

      Use Alien::Build::Plugin::Prefer::SortVersions.

    false value

      Don't set any preference at all. The order returned from GitHub will
      be used if no other prefer plugins are specified. This may be
      reasonable for at least some GitHub repositories. This is the
      default.

ENVIRONMENT

    ALIEN_BUILD_GITHUB_TOKEN GITHUB_TOKEN GITHUB_PAT

      If one of these environment variables are set, then the GitHub API
      Personal Access Token (PAT) will be used when connecting to the
      GitHub API.

      For security reasons, the PAT will be removed from the log. Some
      Fetch plugins (for example the curl plugin) will log HTTP requests
      headers so this will make sure that your PAT is not displayed in the
      log.

CAVEATS

    The GitHub API is rate limited. Once you've reach that limit, this
    plugin will be inoperative for a period of time until the limits reset.
    When using the GitHub API unauthenticated the limit is especially low.
    This is usually not a problem when used in production where you only
    need to use the API once for each Alien, but it can become a problem
    when testing an Alien that uses this plugin in CI or via cpantesters.
    In this situation you can set the ALIEN_BUILD_GITHUB_TOKEN environment
    variable (or commonly used but unofficial GITHUB_TOKEN or GITHUB_PAT),
    and this plugin will use that in making API requests. If you are using
    GitHub Actions for CI, then you can use the secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN macro
    to get a PAT.

    If you do this it is recommended that you make some precautions where
    possible:

    Limit permissions

      Create a PAT with the bare minimum access permissions. Consider
      creating a separate GitHub account without access to anything, and
      use it to generate the PAT.

    Limit scope of usage

      The PAT is only needed (if it is needed at all) during the build
      stage of a share install. If you are doing this in GitHub Actions you
      can just set the environment variable for that stage:

       perl Makefile.PL
       env ALIEN_BUILD_GITHUB_TOKEN=${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} make
       make test

      Or if you are using Dist::Zilla

       dzil listdeps --missing | cpanm -n
       env ALIEN_BUILD_GITHUB_TOKEN=${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} dzil test
