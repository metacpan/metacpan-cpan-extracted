0.34   2017-08-02 09:56 Los Angeles
       - Remove MYMETA.* (RT#108814)
       - Fix installing on 5.26.0+ (RT#121861)

0.33   2014-09-26 17:00 BST
       - In the case where someone is trying to merge configurations
       and some config sets use the depracated 'static' keyword, the
       configs will be properly merged.

0.32   2014-06-04 17:00 EDT
        - Sets 'autoflush' in the Catalyst Log object to false if 
          available. This is a new API being added in Catalyst as of
          version 5.90065

0.31   2013-09-09 16:30:00
        - Updated docs to reflect config key change from 'static' to
          'Plugin::Static::Simple' (RT#77709)
        - Migrated repository from subversion to git
        - Fixed MIME::Types 2.xx compatibility be removing call to an
          undocumented method
        - Bumped the MIME::Types requirement to 2.03 to ensure its
          improvements make it into Catalyst environments

0.30   2012-05-04 17:05:00
        - Add Cache-Control:public header
        - Optionally provide Expires header
        - Change configuration key to 'Plugin::Static::Simple' by default.
          The old 'static' key is still supported, but issues a warning.

0.29   2010-02-01 18:45:00
        - Switch from override to around, because really, wtf

0.28   2010-01-04 13:15:00
        - Fix issues in debug mode. (RT#53338)

0.27   2010-01-03 14:49:00
        - Switch to being a Moose role, removing dependencies on
          Class::Data::Inheritable and Class::Accessor (Andrey Kostenko in
          RT#51089)
        - Make Pod tests mandatory for authors but never run otherwise
        - Switch to Test::NoTabs to ensure no tabs, rather than
          Test::Perl::Critic

0.26   2009-12-06 12:30:00
        - Fix Pod to show less nasty method of assigning config by calling
          the config method with parameters, rather than poking around inside
          the hash.
        - Require newer (>= 0.15) Catalyst::Plugin::SubRequest for subrequest
          tests as old versions don't work with new Catalyst (>= 5.80014)

0.25   2009-10-22 21:40:00 BST
        - Fix bug where old unrelated $@ values would result in an error.

0.24   2009-10-18 19:10:00 BST
        - Fixup copyright information

0.23   2009-10-06 17:40:39
        - Move actions out of TestApp into a Root controller as
          this is now deprecated.

0.22    2009-08-21 18:14:59
        - Add tests for delivering empty files.
        - Fix those tests by depending on Catalyst-Runtime 5.80008.
        - Throw away compatibility code for older catalyst versions.
        - Fix docs to not include plugins in call to ->setup() (t0m)

0.21    2009-03-29 20:31:49
		- Documentation improvements (jester)
        - Change from NEXT to MRO::Compat - RT#40628, RT#44553 (ilmari)
        - Bump prereq to MIME::Types to 1.25 to correctly send files
          commonly used to graft support for transparent PNGs into
          MSIE6 - RT#41314 (Florian Ragwitz)

0.20    2007-09-24 10:00:00
        - Fixed issue where the static dir regex did not add a trailing
          slash so URLs such as /static1 were served as static when they
          should be handled by Catalyst. (Will Hawes)
        - Added text/html Content-Type to 404 responses. (Will Hawes)

0.19    2007-07-02 17:00:00
        - Fixed test failure on some systems in 11serve_static.t due to
          multiple MIME types defined for the extension '.pm'.

0.18    2007-07-01 00:15:00
        - Logging may now be enabled with the less confusing
          MyApp->config->{static}->{logging} = 1;

0.17    2007-05-11 11:00:00
        - Added serve_static_file, to serve a given file as static. (groditi)

0.16    2007-04-30 15:00:00
        - Allow all files in directories defined by the config option 'dirs'
          to be served as static even if the file matches ignore_dirs or
          ignore_extensions.
        - Fixed bug where 204 or 304 status codes would result in a 500 error
          under mod_perl.
        - Switch to Module::Install.

0.15    2006-12-08 22:30:00
        - Quote metacharacters used in $c->config->{dirs} (Vlad Dan Dascalescu)
        - store Mime::Types object in config hash instead of as classdata
        - cleanup code a bit

0.14    2006-03-24 11:15:00
        - Unescape the URI path before looking for the file.  This fixes
          issues with files that have spaces.

0.13    2005-12-15 10:00:00
        - Fixed bug in ignore_dirs under win32.
        - Doc rewriting

0.12    (released only with Catalyst)
        - Made prepare_action play nice with other plugins by not short-
          circuiting.
        - Added tmpl to the ignored extensions.
        - Fixed security problem if req->path contained '..'.

0.11    2005-11-13 16:25:00
        - Removed the code that set the 304 Not Modified header.  This caused
          problems with IE under Apache.
        - Changed 5.50 writing method to pass an IO::File object directly to
          $c->res->body.
        - This version is included with Catalyst 5.50.

0.10    2005-10-19 17:20:00
        - Added tt2 to the list of ignored extensions.
        - For Catalyst 5.5+, replaced File::Slurp with a buffered read/write
          process.  This will improve memory usage and performance on larger
          static files.
        - Removed Apache integration feature.  It is slower than serving
          through Catalyst and as far as I know no one is using it.  If you
          need the best performance, use a separate Location block for static
          content.

0.09    2005-10-07 13:40:00
        - Added new configuration options to improve security:
          ignore_extensions - keep certain extensions from being static
          - This option defaults to tt, html, and xhtml to prevent
            template files from being accessible.
          ignore_dirs - keep certain dirs from being static
        - include_path is no longer experimental.
        - Added support for hiding log output, depends on Cat 5.50. 
          (Marcus Ramberg)

0.08    2005-09-07 18:50:00
        - Added tests for everything except Apache support.

0.07    2005-09-05 21:05:00
        - POD fixes. (Thomas L. Shinnick)

0.06    2005-09-05 15:40:00
        - Moved initial file check into prepare_action so processing can
          bypass other plugins.
        - Added error-checking to static dir regexes.
        - Cleaned up various code as per Best Practices.

0.05    2005-08-26 12:00:00
        - Added use_apache option to enable the Apache DECLINED
          support.  Default is disabled as it appears Catalyst is
          faster at serving the files!
        - Added a check that Apache's DocumentRoot matches Catalyst's
          root before serving DECLINED.
        - Preload MIME::Types index during setup() so it's not built on
          the first request.
        - Added a note on performance of Apache vs. Catalyst.

0.04    2005-08-22 12:00:00
        - Fixed bug where static files were searched for on every request
          even without a file extension.
        - Fixed bug where files without extensions in defined static dirs
          were not served with text/plain.
        - Consolidated the debug log messages.

0.03    2005-08-21 23:50:00
        - Added config option for include_path to allow for multiple 
          directories with static files.  This option should be
          considered experimental!
        - Documentation cleanups.

0.02    2005-08-16 18:00:00
        - Return DECLINED when running under mod_perl to allow Apache to
          serve the static file.  This is not done when any custom MIME
          types have been specified, however.

0.01    2005-08-11 22:00:00
        - Initial release.
