NAME
    Panda::NSS - Perl bindings to NSS Mozilla security library

VERSION
    version 0.004

SYNOPSIS
      # verify certificate
      use Panda::NSS;

      Panda::NSS::init($nssdb_path);
      Panda::NSS::add_builtins();

      my $cert = Panda::NSS::Cert->new($cert_data_in_der_format);

      if ($cert->simple_verify(Panda::NSS::CERTIFICATE_USAGE_OBJECT_SIGNER)) {
          print "Certificate OK\n";
      }
      else {
          print "Certificate NOT VALID\n";
      }

DESCRIPTION
    This library is in very early stage of development. Any API can change.
    Currently you can verify certificates with AIA extension (when not all
    chain exists locally).

FUNCTIONS
    "Panda::NSS::init( [ $certdb_path ] )"
        This function initialize NSS library. It calls
        "NSS_InitReadWrite(dbpath)". However you may not specify
        $certdb_path, in that case "NSS_NoDB_Init()" called, that mode not
        very useful for certificate checks.

    "Panda::NSS::reinit()"
        This function should be called after fork to reinitialize NSS
        library. Any outstanding handles will become invalid, but new will
        work.

        Actually this function compare current PID with saved in previous
        "init" or "reinit" one and calls "SECMOD_RestartModules(false)" if
        needed.

        Example:

          use Panda::NSS;

          Panda::NSS::init($nssdb_path);

          my $pid = fork();
          if ($pid == 0) {
              # child
              Panda::NSS::reinit();
              # ... other code in child
          }

    "Panda::NSS::add_builtins()"
        This function load nssckbi module, that contains default root
        certificates in NSS. May croaks if library initialized without
        certdb.

CLASSES
  "Panda::NSS::Cert"
   CONSTRUCTOR
    "$cert = Panda::NSS::Cert->new( $data )"
        Constructs certificate object.

        $data can be certificate in DER binary format or in PEM format
        (Base64 encoded DER certificate, enclosed between *"-----BEGIN
        CERTIFICATE-----"* and *"-----END CERTIFICATE-----"*). Format is
        auto-detected.

   PROPERTIES
    "$cert->version"
        Returns certificate version. 1, 2 or 3.

    "$cert->serial_number"
        Returns certificate serial number as a binary string.

    "$cert->serial_number_hex"
        Returns certificate serial number as a hex encoded string.

    "$cert->subject"
        Returns certificate subject as a string.

    "$cert->issuer"
        Returns certificate issuer as a string.

    "$cert->common_name"
        Returns common name extracted from subject.

    "$cert->country_name"
        Returns country name extracted from subject.

    "$cert->locality_name"
        Returns locality name extracted from subject.

    "$cert->state_name"
        Returns state field extracted from subject.

    "$cert->org_name"
        Returns organization name extracted from subject.

    "$cert->org_unit_name"
        Returns organization unit extracted from subject.

    "$cert->domain_component_name"
        Returns domain component extracted from subject.

   METHODS
    "$rv = $cert->simple_verify( [ $usage ], [ $time ])"
        Arguments:

        $usage (Default: "CERTIFICATE_USAGE_CHECK_ALL_USAGES")
          Certificate usage. One of "CERTIFICATE_USAGE_*" constants.

        $time (Default: current time)
          Time at which the certificate should be valid.

        Method do verification process (it uses "CERT_PKIXVerifyCert" from
        *NSS*).

        Returns "true" if certificate valid.

    "$rv = $cert->verify_signed_data( $data, $signature, [ $time ])"
        Verify the signature of a signed data with the given certificate.

        Returns "true" if signature match.
