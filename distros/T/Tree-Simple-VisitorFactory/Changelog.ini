- No code changes.

Comments= <<EOT
- No code changes.
- Delete Build.PL.
- Fix my licence (sic) mess so all references are to Perl. This involves edits to Makefile.PL
and LICENSE. See RT#113949. Thanx Kent Fredric.
- Fix Makefile.PL so modules only used for testing are in TEST_REQUIRES and not PREREQ_PM.
See RT#113948. Thanx Kent Fredric.
- Fix README so it more-or-less conforms to the Perl Foundation's guidelines at
http://www.perlfoundation.org/cpan_licensing_guidelines.
