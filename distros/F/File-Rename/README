File-Rename version 0.20
========================

File::Rename provides an implementation of Larry Wall's eg/rename
command.  All I have done is add some error checking and (more recently)
add the File/Rename.pm module.

An earlier version of the script is out in the Internet and is included
with some linuxes, and the original eg/rename is not included in the
Perl distribution, so I have put this up on CPAN.

A revised version of the earlier script is now on the Internet,
which includes more options.  This script, distinguished by
"Getopt::Long::Configure('bundling')", was not written by me; I think
the author is Aristotle Pagaltzis.  Version 0.10 of this distribution
has similar options to the revised script.

For Windows, the script is called file-rename to avoid clashes with
existing rename command.

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules and libraries:
File::Basename File::Path File::Spec Getopt::Long
(all included with Perl). 

Testing requires File::Temp and Test::More which are
available with perl 5.6.0.  I have successfully installed
those modules for perl 5.005_05 and tested this module.
