Revision history for McBain

	- Improvement: in contextual mode, if McBain doesn't find a context class under
	  the root package, it will go up the package hierarchy until it finds one. For
	  example, if the root package is Some::API, then McBain will try Some::API::Context,
	  then Some::Context, then finally Context. This was added to allow the sharing of
	  the same context class in a project comprised of several APIs.
