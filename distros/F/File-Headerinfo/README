File::Headerinfo

DESCRIPTION

All this module does is to gather together a set of existing file-reader modules 
and put them all behind a simple friendly interface. it has a factory architecture
that should make it easy to extend, and using it is as simple as:

  my $info = File::Headerinfo->read('/path/to/file.ext');

The only installation problem is likely to be Video::Info, which currently
depends on openquicktime. With some small tinkering you can remove that 
dependency: let me know if you want details.

For that or any other problems: contact will on wross@cpan.org.
