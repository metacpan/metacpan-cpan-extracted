2.12  2017-04-17T16:22:00

	- Allow for a line in CHANGES to contain just 1 long token, without outputting a warning under recent Perls.

2.00  2011-02-15T14:59:00
	- Rewrite to allow client access to the memory-based version of Changelog.ini.
	- Add scripts/report.names.pl to demonstrate this feature.
	- new() now takes a hash, not a hashref, since I've adopted the fabulous Hash::FieldHash.
	- Replace eval{} with Try::Tiny.
	- Only remove commas from lines which match /^\d/, since the digit(s) are assumed to be a version #,
	  and hence the commas are assumed to be embedded in dates.
	- Discontinue convert() and convert_body(), which were available in V 1.
	- What used to be convert() is now writer(reader() ).
	- What used to be convert_body() is now transform().
	- The default input file (under -c) is CHANGES, not ./CHANGES.
	- The default input file (without -c) is Changelog.ini, not ./Changelog.ini.
	- Add warnings to docs that config(), get_latest_release() and get_latest_version() must be called after read().
	- Replace /usr/bin/perl with /usr/bin/env perl.
	- Replace common::sense with use strict and use warnings, to get uninit var warnings.
	- Replace Carp::croak with die.
	- Use real version numbers instead of 0 in the required modules lists in Build.PL and Makefile.PL.

1.06  2009-11-12T10:19:00
	  - Run dos2unix on all files.

1.05  2009-07-08T10:08:00
	  - Rename t/Changes to t/Non.standard.name because under MS Windows there is no difference
	  	between the name t/Changes and the other test file t/CHANGES
	  - Patch t/02.convert.t to match
	  - Use File::HomeDir rather than relying on $ENV{'HOME'}

1.04  2009-02-18T11:46:00
	  - Output 'Changelog.*' rather than 'Configlog.*' in the [Module] section of Changelog.ini
	  - Rename Changes.txt to CHANGES because search.cpan.org won't display Changes.txt
	  - Rename t/*_*.t to t/*.*.t (since I prefer '.' to '_' in file names, because '_' is a shift char)

1.03  2008-07-22T14:41:00

1.02  2008-07-16T17:14:00
