GETTING STARTED

      > vayne-init -d $HOME/vayne
    
      # Setup configurations in $HOME/vayne/conf (zookeeper mongodb redis)
    
      # Add our first region, then the region info will upload to zk server.
      > vayne-ctrl --set --region region-first --server redisserver:port --password redispasswd
    
      # Define our first task, $HOME/vayne/task/foo

DESCRIPTION

    Vayne is a distribute task queue with many feature.

 FEATURE

    Logical Region with Flexible Spawning Strategy

      Has the concept of logical region. You can spawn task into different
      region with strategy. Spawning strategy can be easily write.

    Custome Task Flow with Reusable Worker

      Worker is a process can do some specific stuffs. Step have a step's
      name, a worker's name and parameters. You can define custome task
      flow by constructing any steps.

    Simple Worker Interface with Good Performance

      Vayne::Worker is using Coro which can provide excellent performance
      in network IO. Worker has a simple interface to write, also you can
      use Coro::* module to enhance worker performance. Whole system is
      combined with Message Queue. You can get a better performance easily
      by increasing the worker counts while MQ is not the bottleneck.

  0. Task Conf & Step

    The Task Conf is combined with several ordered steps. Each step have a
    step's name, a worker's name and parameters. Workload will be prosessed
    step by step.

  1. Spawn Task

    Vayne support CLI and API to spawn a task. A task contain numbers of
    jobs. Task info will write to task collection in mongodb first. Jobs
    will be hashed into saperated region by strategy. Then enqueue jobs to
    their region's redis queue named by first step of the job, and write to
    job collection in mongodb.

  2. Queue & Region

    Like Redis::JobQueue, Vayne use redis for job queuing and job info
    caching. The data structure is nearly the same as "JobQueue data
    structure stored in Redis" in Redis::JobQueue.

    Each region has a queue(redis server). Both their infomation are saved
    on zookeeper server.

    Each real server which you want to run workers should belong to a
    region.

    Worker will register its names under real server's region on zookeeper
    server when it start.

    Details see "DATA STRUCTURE" in Vayne::Zk.

  2. Worker

    When it start, worker register its names on zookeeper server. Then
    generate some Coro threads below:

    Check the Registration

      Go die when the registration changed. Ex: Region info changed; Real
      Server switch to another region; Connection to zk failed.

       * The worker will die very quickly when zookeeper server is not
      available. It may cause some problems. Should be careful. 

    Job Consumer

      BLPOP queues which worker registered, then put the job into
      Coro::Channel

    Worker

      Get job from Coro::Channel, and do the stuff with it. Tag the result
      and status on the job. Put the job to update Coro::Channel.

    Update Job Info

      Get Job from update Coro::Channel. Push the job to next queue
      according to the job's step.

    INT, TERM, HUP signals will be catched. Then graceful stop the worker.

  4. JOB TRACKER

    Job tracker is a special worker, it just send the job info dealed by
    previous workers to mongodb. Usually 'tracker' should be the last step
    of a job.

  5. TASK TRACKER
