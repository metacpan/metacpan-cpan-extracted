	  5.8.0 or 5.8.1 PM_FILTER syntax;

0.23  Dec 23, 2002

	  ExtUtils::MakeMaker takes care of the full task.

0.22  Dec 20, 2002

0.17  Oct 30, 2000
        - added a -type => ZERO that don't processes its sub-elements
	  and return "". It is good to avoid visiting certain parts of
          the document, and for better performance.

0.16  Oct 16, 2000
	- problems with the changes on UNICODE
        - 0.15 does not work with Perl 5.005;
          Solution: "use bytes" if we find it.
          eval("use bytes") if ($inc{bytes.pm}) { require and import...}  

0.15  Sep 16, 2000
        - Corrected bug in pod;
