NAME
    URI::BNode - RDF blank node identifiers which are also URI objects

VERSION
    Version 0.06

SYNOPSIS
        my $bnode = URI::BNode->new;

        print "$bnode\n"; # something like _:EH_kW827XQ6vvX0yF8YzRA

DESCRIPTION
    This module has two purposes:

    1   Provide a reliable factory interface for generating RDF blank nodes
        (via random UUIDs permuted through Data::UUID::NCName).

    2   When an RDF blank node class is a subclass of URI, you can use
        identity tests to make more robust RDF interfaces, like so:

            $node->isa('URI');        # either URI or bnode, but not literal
            $node->isa('URI::BNode'); # narrow it down further

        Along the same vein, coerce string literals into the correct class
        by heuristic:

            my $subject = '_:foo';
            my $node = URI::BNode->new($subject); # _:foo becomes a bnode

            # URI::BNode->new('http://foo/') would properly become
            # a URI::http object.

METHODS
  new [$ID]
    Creates a new blank node identifier. If $ID is undefined or empty, one
    will be generated using Data::UUID::NCName. If $ID has a value, it must
    either begin with "_:" or conform to the blank node syntax from the
    Turtle spec. Other values, including other URIs, will be passed to the
    URI constructor.

  name [$NEWVAL]
    Alias for "opaque".

  opaque [$NEWVAL]
    Retrieve or, if supplied a value, replace the blank node's value with a
    new one. This method will croak if passed a $NEWVAL which doesn't match
    the spec in <http://www.w3.org/TR/turtle/#BNodes>.

  from_uuid_urn $UUID
    Takes a URI::urn::uuid object and turns it into a blank node. Can be
    invoked as either a class or an instance method.

  to_uuid_urn
    Takes a blank node (in the proper form) and turns it into a
    URI::urn::uuid object.

  skolemize $AUTHORITY
    Return the skolemized URI ("$AUTHORITY/.well-known/genid/...") for a
    given blank node. See RDF 1.1 Concepts
    <http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/#section-skolemization>.

  de_skolemize $URI
    Take a skolemized URI like "http://foo.com/.well-known/genid/asdf" and
    turn it into "_:asdf".
