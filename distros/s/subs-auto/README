NAME
    subs::auto - Read barewords as subroutine names.

VERSION
    Version 0.08

SYNOPSIS
        {
         use subs::auto;
         foo;             # Compile to "foo()"     instead of "'foo'"
                          #                        or croaking on strict subs
         foo $x;          # Compile to "foo($x)"   instead of "$x->foo"
         foo 1;           # Compile to "foo(1)"    instead of croaking
         foo 1, 2;        # Compile to "foo(1, 2)" instead of croaking
         foo(@a);         # Still ok
         foo->meth;       # "'foo'->meth" if you have use'd foo somewhere,
                          #  or "foo()->meth" otherwise
         print foo 'wut'; # print to the filehandle foo if it's actually one,
                          #  or "print(foo('wut'))" otherwise
        } # ... but function calls will fail at run-time if you don't
          # actually define foo somewhere

        foo; # BANG

DESCRIPTION
    This pragma lexically enables the parsing of any bareword as a
    subroutine name, except those which corresponds to an entry in %INC
    (expected to be class names) or whose symbol table entry has an IO slot
    (expected to be filehandles).

    You can pass options to "import" as key / value pairs :

    *   "in => $pkg"

        Specifies on which package the pragma should act. Setting $pkg to
        "Some::Package" allows you to resolve all functions name of the type
        "Some::Package::func ..." in the current scope. You can use the
        pragma several times with different package names to allow
        resolution of all the corresponding barewords.

        Defaults to the current package.

    This module is not a source filter.

EXPORT
    None.

CAVEATS
    "*{'::foo'}{CODE}" will appear as defined in a scope where the pragma is
    enabled, "foo" is used as a bareword, but is never actually defined
    afterwards. This may or may not be considered as Doing The Right Thing.
    However, "*{'::foo'}{CODE}" will always return the right value if you
    fetch it outside the pragma's scope. Actually, you can make it return
    the right value even in the pragma's scope by reading "*{'::foo'}{CODE}"
    outside (or by actually defining "foo", which is ultimately why you use
    this pragma, right ?).

    You have to open global filehandles outside of the scope of this pragma
    if you want them not to be treated as function calls. Or just use
    lexical filehandles and default ones as you should be.

    This pragma doesn't propagate into "eval STRING".

DEPENDENCIES
    perl 5.10.0.

    A C compiler. This module may happen to build with a C++ compiler as
    well, but don't rely on it, as no guarantee is made in this regard.

    Variable::Magic with "uvar" magic enabled (this should be assured by the
    required perl version).

    B::Keywords.

    Carp (standard since perl 5), XSLoader (since 5.6.0).
