NAME
    Callback::Cleanup - Declare callbacks that clean themselves up

SYNOPSIS
            use Callback::Cleanup;

            my $anon_sub = callback {
                    # this is the sub body
            } cleanup {
                    # this is called on DESTROY
            }

            # or

            Callback::Cleanup->new(
                    sub { }, # callback
                    sub { }, # cleanup
            );

DESCRIPTION
    This is a very simple module that provides syntactic sugar for callbacks
    that need to finalize somehow.

    Callbacks are very convenient APIs when they have no definite end of
    life. If an end of life behavior is required this helps keep the cleanup
    code and callback code together.

EXPORTS
    callback BLOCK $cleanup
    cleanup BLOCK $callback
        Both of these exports act as the identity function when given only
        one parameter.

        When given enough arguments they will create a Callback::Cleanup
        object.

        This means that you can declare a callback with a cleanup like this:

                my $cleans_up = callback {

                } cleanup {
                
        }

        Or a derived sub that cleans up an existing subref:

                my $cleans_up = cleanup {

                } \&needs_cleanup;

        As well as a few other useless forms.

CLOSURES AND GARBAGE COLLECTION
    In perl code references that are not closures aren't garbage collected
    (they are shared).

    This module uses "clone_if_immortal" in Sub::Clone to make sure timely
    destruction of these callbacks happens.
