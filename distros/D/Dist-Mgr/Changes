Revision history for Dist-Mgr

1.06    2021-01-15
    - Bump prereq version of File::Copy::Recursive, as older versions of perl
      came with v0.38 which didn't export rmove_glob(), which would cause tests
      to fail. We now require v0.45
    - Added _dist_dir_re(), contains the distribution's directory for using in
      testing to confirm we're in the proper location in the file system. Some
      CPAN testers use varying dir names, so tests were failing
    - v1.06 RC1

1.05    2021-01-13
    - Change -x to -w in distmgr POD
    - Moved distmgr POD from binary to separate POD file
    - Add distmgr command process flow documentation to the README (closes #37)
    - Added config file integration (config(), config_file(), distmgr config)
      (closes #40)
    - Regex cleanup in test files that check the current working directory
      (some CPAN testers dump the dist into a numbered directory)
    - Added copyright bump functionality (copyright_bump(), copyright_info())
      (closes #32)
    - We now save an existing config file before testing, and restore it after
    - Check if git status differs before waiting for CI tests to complete
    - Test fixes regarding MANIFEST files

1.03    2021-01-12
    - POD fixes and updates
    - In distmgr, add user interaction prior to cpan_upload() so the user can
      confirm for certain that the dist tarball should be uploaded
    - Renamed git_status() to git_status_differs() to be less confusing
    - We now skip over Git operations and CI testing if 'release' is called and
      nothing has changed (closes #38)
    - Added more output surrounding CPAN uploads
    - version_info() now sets a default directory if $fs_entry not sent in
    - distmgr release now has --wait and --nowait for CI test run completion
    - distmgr binary now has thorough and complete unit tests
    - distmgr release wasn't sending proper params to cpan_upload()
