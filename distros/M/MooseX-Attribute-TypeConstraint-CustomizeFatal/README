NAME
    MooseX::Attribute::TypeConstraint::CustomizeFatal - Control how failed
    type constraint checks are handled

SYNOPSIS
        package Class;
        use Moose;
        use MooseX::Types::Moose ':all';
        use MooseX::Attribute::TypeConstraint::CustomizeFatal;

        my %attributes = (
            a => "warning",
            b => "default",
            c => "default_no_warning",
            d => "error",
        );

        while (my ($attribute, $on_typeconstraint_failure) = each %attributes) {
            has $attribute => (
                is                        => 'ro',
                isa                       => Int,
                default                   => 12345,

                traits                    => ['TypeConstraint::CustomizeFatal'],
                on_typeconstraint_failure => $on_typeconstraint_failure,
            );
        }

        package main;

        Class->new(
            a => "foo", # will be "foo" but will warn
            b => "foo", # will be 12345 but will warn
            c => "foo", # will be 12345 but won't warn
            # d => "foo", # will die, just like Moose does by default
        );

        my $class = Class->new;
        # Does *NOT* work (even if "is" was "rw"), all of this dies
        # $class->(a => "foo");
        # $class->(b => "foo");
        # $class->(c => "foo");
        # $class->(d => "foo");

        1; # *NOT* __PACKAGE__->meta->make_immutable;

DESCRIPTION
    By default Moose will just die if you give an attribute a typeconstraint
    that fails. This trait allows you to customize that behavior to make
    failures either issue an error like Moose does by default (this is the
    default), a warning and keep the invalid value, or falling back to the
    default value either silently or with a warning.

CAVEATS
    This only works when you construct your class (i.e. with "new") and not
    when setting the values later with an accessor. Therefore you can use
    this to construct a validating object that has only "ro" attributes, but
    not to incrementally add data to the "rw" attributes of a constructed
    object (we'll just die on invalid data as Moose does by default).

    This also doesn't work if you make your classes immutable. I.e. with
    "__PACKAGE__-"meta->make_immutable;> at the end of the class in question
    instead of "1;".

    I might address these caveats in future versions (I'd like to,
    suggestions/patches welcome), but don't count on it.

    But even with these caveats this is still really useful for constructing
    a validated object all at once from say a HTTP request or to validate
    data by piggy-backing on the Moose type system without inventing your
    own validation logic.

RATIONALE
    A lot of our existing validation code just warns on or ignores invalid
    values, whereas Moose will die on invalid values.

    This makes converting a lot of code inconvenient, particularly code that
    has values that are supplied directly by the user, usually we don't want
    the whole process to die if we have some invalid parameter.

    We're dealing with these in some cases by wrapping a Moose constructor
    in try/catch, but that only allows us to either construct an object or
    not, this trait gives us a much more finely grained control over this
    not an attribute level.

    Now you can define on an attribute level what should be done with
    invalid values, we can either throw an error (the default), warn and
    keep the invalid value, fall back on the default either with a warning
    or without one.

    This makes it easy to write user facing code that dispatches directly to
    a Moose class. If the user provides us with correct values: great! If he
    doesn't we can just ignore the provided value, replace it with a
    default, and move on.

    In other cases you might want to spew warnings when you start getting
    unexpected values, but you don't want to die and return an error to the
    user just because some minor subsystem rendering the page is getting a
    value it didn't expect.

    This module was originally developed at and for Booking.com. With
    approval from Booking.com, this module was generalized and put on CPAN,
    for which the authors would like to express their gratitude.
