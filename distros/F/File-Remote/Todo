Still need to create equivalents to these functions:

   flock    fcntl    dbmopen    dbmclose
   opendir  readdir  closedir   stat

There should also be a way to overcome the limitation
that currently exists whereby you can't read from remote
files that are ever-growing. Basically, a snapshot of
the remote file is taken when open() is called, and this
should probably be changed.

Patches that accomplish any of these are quite welcome.
