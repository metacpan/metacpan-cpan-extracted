NAME
    Object::Signature - Generate cryptographic signatures for objects

SYNOPSIS
      # In your module
      package My::Module
      use base 'Object::Signature';
      
  # In outside code
      my $Object = My::Module->new;  
      print "Object Signature: " . $Object->signature;

DESCRIPTION
    Object::Signature is an abstract base class that you can inherit from in
    order to allow your objects to generate unique cryptographic signatures.

    The method used to generate the signature is based on Storable and
    Digest::MD5. The object is fed to "Storable::nfreeze" to get a string,
    which is then passed to Digest::MD5::md5_hex to get a unique 32
    character hexidecimal signature.

METHODS
  signature
    The "signature" method is the only method added to your class, and will
    generate a unique 32 hexidecimal signature for any object it is called
    on.

SUPPORT
    All bugs should be filed via the bug tracker at

TO DO
  Incremental Generation
    Currently has to generate the entire Storable string before digesting
    it. Would be nice if there was a way to incrementally Storablise and
    Digest in one pass so that it becomes much more memory efficient for
    large objects.

  Strengthen the Digest Algorithm
    Once the current (as of 2005) hashing controversy settles down, consider
    selecting a newer and more powerful hashing algorithm to replace MD5. Or
    offer alternatives depending on how important the security situation is,
    as MD5 is very fast (90 meg a second) and many more-secure ones are a
    lot slower (more than 10 times slower in some cases).

    On our side is the fact we use Storable. It should be much harder to
    create collisions when you don't control the string, only the structure
    before it goes through Storable.
