20110117  2011-10-17
    - make sure DllMain() has "C" linkage when compiled with MinGW
      (Haiko Strotbek). [rt#64575]
    - change StartService() and GetServiceHandle() to return proper
      64-bit value on Win64 (Haiko Strotbek). [rt#64577]

20101014  2010-10-14
    - minimal POD cleanup
    - avoid CPAN indexing of the packages under test/
    - QueryLastMessage() had been renamed to LastControlMessage().
      Rename it back to preserve backwards compatibility.

20091028  2009-10-28
    - Disabled END {} in non-main threads to fix bug RT#50020 (Olivier Mengué)

20080321  2008-03-21
    - Added support for SERVICE_CONTROL_PRESHUTDOWN.
    - Callbacks can now return a state value. This is the functional equivalent
      of calling Win32::Daemon::State( $NewState ) before returning:
        //	sub EventCallback
        //	{
        //	  my( $Event, $Context ) = @_;
        //		# Process the event
        //		Win32::Daemon::State( $NewState );
        //	  return;
        //	}
        //	=================== SAME AS ====================
        //	sub EventCallback
        //	{
        //	  my( $Event, $Context ) = @_;
        //		# Process the event
        //	  return( $NewState );
        //	}
    - Callback timer works correctly!
    - CALLBACK_RUNNING has been depreciated and replaced with CALLBACK_TIMER.
      It is only called when the timer (set by CallbackTimer()) has expired.
      Use this as a heartbeat. You only need to set it once either with
      CallbackTimer() or passing in the timer value when calling into
      StartService(). Set the callback using "timer" as the callback name.
      Using "running" will also work but it is mapped to "timer". If you
      specify both, only "timer" will be registered.
    - Created TestFramework.pm to help with testing services.
    - Pruned out unnecessary stuff from Daemon.pm file.

20070102  2007-01-02
    - Cleaned up a bit.
    - Added WM_QUIT message to the ServiceMain function. Now the Perl StopService() will
      post this message to shut down the service thread.
    - Fixed bug where messages were posted to wrong thread.

20061222  2006-12-22
    - Converted to XS file.
    - Fixed callback heartbeat: now properly calls back with SERVICE_RUNNING
      (not SERVICE_CONTROL_RUNNING)
    - StopService() will post WM_QUIT message to the ServiceMain() thread to
      shut down the service thread.
    - Calling into StopService() will auto change the state to STOPPING/STOPPED
      so you do not need to explicitly do so (calling State() or a callback
      returning STOPPING/STOPPED).

20030617  2003-06-17
    - Added support for querying and setting service security. This includes
      DACL and SACL support. Due to complexity and failures you can not set
      owner or group. But in most cases (99%) this is not needed.
    - GetSecurity()
    - SetSecurity()
    - Finished incorporating callback routines.
    - Added a few more events.

20020605  2002-06-05
    - Added support for reporting service errors. You can now pass in a
      hash reference into State(). More details in the POD docs.
    - Modified: UpdateServiceStatus() function to accept a 3rd parameter
      (dwError). This allows the calling code to report a service error.

20020114  2002-01-14
    - Fixed another bug where service wouldn't work on WinXP machines. Variable
      recognized_controls was wrongly initialized for WinXP systems. This
      rendered the service unable to start, pause or stop. Fix was only in
      the Daemon.pm file. (marc.pijnappels@nec-computers.com)

20020108  2002-01-08
    - Fixed another bug wwhere servie wouldn't work on Win2k machines. We
      were treating Win2k (version 5.0) the same as WinXP (version 5.1) and
      adding WinXP specific controls. This rendered the service unable to
      start, pause or stop. Fix was only in the Daemon.pm file.

20011230  2001-12-30
    - Fixed bug where service doesn't work properly with Windows NT 4. We were
      defaulting by acccepting the SERVICE_ACCEPT_PARAMCHANGE and
      SERVICE_ACCEPT_NETBINDCHANGE controls. However, they were introduced in
      Win2k so NT 4 coughed up blood with them. (rothd@roth.net)

20011221  2001-12-21
    - Fixed bug where service doesn't work properly with Windows NT 4. We were
      defaulting by acccepting the SERVICE_ACCEPT_PARAMCHANGE and
      SERVICE_ACCEPT_NETBINDCHANGE controls. However, they were introduced in
      Win2k so NT 4 coughed up blood with them.

20011217  2001-12-17
    - Added support for .Net Server accept control contants:
      SERVICE_ACCEPT_HARDWAREPROFILECHANGE
      SERVICE_ACCEPT_POWEREVENT
      SERVICE_ACCEPT_SESSIONCHANGE

20011205  2001-12-05
    - AcceptedControls()
    - Fixed bug where "invalid service state 80" is reported in the Win32 event
      log.
    - Added initial support for SCM request callbacks (this is not implemented
      fully and is not supported yet).
    - Added SERVICE_CONTROL_NONE constant
    - Fixed State() so it only returns states, not commands.
    - Modified QueryLastMessage(). It now allows you to reset the last message
      to SERVICE_CONTROL_NONE.
    - Added SERVICE_NOT_READY state
    - Cleaned up some states.
    - Added AcceptedControls() function.

20010224  2001-02-24
    - RegisterCallbacks() (and callback support)

20000618  2000-06-18
    - ConfigureService
    - QueryServiceConfig
