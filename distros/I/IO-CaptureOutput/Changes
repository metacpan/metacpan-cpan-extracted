      temporary ones (adapted from patch from Anton Berezin)

1.05_53 Sat Nov 17 18:45:08 EST 2007

    - MSVC++ fixes for Inline::C testing breaks on other compilers; this
      version uses separate C routines for MSVC++ and other compilers

1.05_52 Sat Nov 17 14:47:52 EST 2007

    - changed Inline::C code for printing to stdout to match that for stderr;
      works around a bug if the intalled MSVC++ version doesn't match the
      version used to build ActiveState Perl on MSWin32.

1.05_51 Sat Nov 17 13:36:39 EST 2007

    - changed Inline::C code for printing to stderr to attempt to work around
      a segfault bug on some MSWin32 systems (Alternative described by

    - minor Perl::Critic cleanup to pass xt tests

1.05 Fri Nov 16 08:44:06 EST 2007

    *** No changes since 1.04_03; key changes since 1.03 follows ***

    - added support for capture() merging STDERR and STDOUT to the same
      scalar, i.e. "capture( \&foo, \$out, \$out )" (RT#24695)

    - added capture_exec_combined() and alias qxy() to merge STDERR and STDOUT
      for subprocess execution (RT#29289)

    - bugfix: stop crashing if output filehandles are previously closed or
      if running without a console on MSWin32 (i.e. wperl.exe) (RT#23676)

    - bugfix: capture.t would fail on Win32 if Inline::C was installed;
      fixed the sample C code used in testing to flush stderr (RT#21712)

    - bugfix: was failing on perl 5.8.0 due to extraneous space in call
      to open(); removing the space fixed the bug (RT#22044)

1.04_03 Sun Nov  4 11:35:57 EST 2007

    - suppress warnings included in captured output when console output
      handles were previously closed; only affects some versions/builds of
