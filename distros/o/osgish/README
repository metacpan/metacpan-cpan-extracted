INTRODUCTION

  Osgish is command line shell for OSGi. It is based on the Readline
  Library, Jolokia as JMX backend and Aries JMX as the OSGi Management
  layer, with Perl being the glue.

  Highlights of osgish are:

  * Readline and history support based on GNU Readline/History as
    known from other shells like 'bash'. When GNU Readline is not
    available, a pure Perl Module is used instead.
  * Context sensitive argument completion, e.g. on bundle symbolic
    names. 
  * Colored output (can be switched off)
  * Multi-Server support
  * Remote operation via HTTP(S)

  THIS IS A PREVIEW. Currently you can list, start and stop bundles
  only. If you have a use case you want to have covered, please don't
  hesistate to contact roland@cpan.org. 

  Said this, osgish is already pretty useful.

HOW IT WORKS

  Osgish consist of mainly two parts: A Perl command line script
  (along with some Perl modules) which connects to an OSGi container
  via a special OSGi agent bundle. This bundle contains for exports
  JMX information through an OSGi HttpService as JSON data. The JMX
  MBeans used are those provided by the Aries
  (http://aries.apache.org) which is the implementation of the OSGi
  Alliance Enterprise Expert Group (EEG) specification, especially the
  "JMX Management Model Specification".

  Although this setup sounds a bit involved, installation is not much
  more than installing a CPAN package and a provided OSGi bundle (the
  same as for jmx4perl). 

INSTALLATION

  The Perl part installs as any other module via Module::Build, which
  you need to have installed. Using

  perl Build.PL
  ./Build
  ./Build test
  ./Build install

  will install the modules. If you have Java and Maven (a Java build
  tool) installed, the agent bundle will be compiled and packaged as
  well when you use './Build dist'. However, this is not required as a
  prepackaged bundle is contained within the agent directory.

  Osgish depends on the Perl Module 'Term::ReadLine' (indirectly via
  Term::ShellUI), which can be used with various backend Readline
  implementations. The most powerful (and hence recommended)
  implementation is GNU Readline/History Library which will be used if
  installed. It is really worth to go the extra way to install GNU
  readline, even on OS X or Windows (which is not trivial). E.g. for
  OS X you can use the package 'p5-term-readline-gnu' from Mac Ports
  to install readline along with the needed module. For Debian, the
  easiest way is to install the package 'libterm-readline-gnu-perl'
  via apt. However, the default implementation Term::ReadLine::Perl
  fits nicely, too.

  The agent parts comes in two flavors: A minimal
  'osgish-core-<version>.jar' bundle and and all-in-one bundle
  'osgish-bundle-<version>.jar'. The all-in-one bundle is the proper
  choice, if no HTTP service is already installed since it has Apache
  Felix HTTP service embedded. However, the pure bundle is recommended
  for installations onservers, which either provide an HTTP service on
  their own or has an HTTP connector installed (e.g. Glassfish). This
  pure bundle has a dependency on an OSGi HttpService, which needs to
  be available. Some OSGi container (like Glassfish v3) already comes
  with a HttpService as an installation option, for others you need to
  install one manually. A good choice is the Pax Web
  (http://wiki.ops4j.org/display/paxweb/Pax+Web) HttpService. Select
  the pax-web-jetty-bundle when downloading, it contains a all you
  need.

  Also, for the pure bundle the following Aries bundles, needs to be
  installed so that JMX exposes the required information:

  org.apache.aries.jmx (>= 0.3.0)
  org.apache.aries.util (>= 0.3.0)

  These bundles can be obtained from the Aries website aries.apache.org

  Finally, the bundle needs the Jolokia agent
  jolokia-osgi-<version>.jar, too. You can obtain it from
  www.jolokia.org. 

  The bundles needs to be installed manully. Refer to your OSGi
  framework how to install a bundle (e.g. by calling 'install' in a
  OSGi shell or providing the bundle name during startup).

  Considered you the HttpService is available at its default port
  8080, you can connect to it via

  osgish http://localhost:8080/jolokia

  (This assumes, that the HttpService has a root context '/' which is
  true for Pax Web. Glassfish v3's HttpService use a root context of
  '/osgi' which results in a connect URL of
  http://localhost:8080/osgi/jolokia)

SUPPORTED OSGI PLATFORMS
  
  The following OSGi platform has been confirmed to work so far
  with: 

  * Felix 4
  * Equinox 3.5
  * Glassfish v3.1 
  * Spring dm Server 2.0

  Since OSGi bundles are highly portable, it is expected that every
  OSGi server with an installed HttpService should work out of the
  box.  Please open a bug at
  http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Report.html?Queue=osgish if you
  encounter any problems.

PLATFORM NOTES

  * Glassfish

    The easiest way to install bundles with glassfish is to copy the
    bundles to $DOMAIN/autodeploy/bundles Autodeployment can be
    switched on/off from the admin console ("Domain" : "Applications
    Configuration" : "Auto Deploy").

    Please ensure, that the Glassfish OSGi HTTP-Service is running. 

    Copy the following jars into the $DOMAIN/autodeploy/bundles
    directory: 

    jolokia-osgi-1.0.2.jar           (www.jolokia.org)
    org.apache.aries.jmx-0.3.jar     (aries.apache.org)
    org.apache.aries.util-0.3.jar    (aries.apache.org)
    osgish-core-0.3.0.jar            (from this distribution)

    In order to connect to the server when it is running, use

    osgish http://localhost:8080/osgi/jolokia
