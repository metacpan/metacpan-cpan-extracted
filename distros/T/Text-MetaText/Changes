#
#   This file lists the changes to the Text::MetaText module from 
#   version 0.01 onwards.  Development work on the Template::Base 
#   module, from which Text::MetaText is derived, is not included.
#
#   The list includes internal changes as well as user-visible ones and
#   as such may seem unnecessarily verbose or irrelevant in places.

#========================================================================


#------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Version 0.01    Date: 1997/04/29 12:09:47
#------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Original code migrated from ancestral Template::Base module.  


#------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Version 0.02    Date: 1997/04/29 12:12:07
#------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Cleaned up and optimised much of the existing Template::Base code.

* Added user-definable MAGIC tokens, including different tokens for 
  start/end of MetaText directive.

* Updated filter functions definition

* Added user-definable warning function (ERROR)

* Added user-definable debug function (DEBUG) providing multi-level
  reporting

* Replaced old-style typeglobs with FileHandles

* Modified _split_params() to recognise single parameters (e.g. "noprint")
  as flags rather than requiring a balanced "name = value".  Flags are 
  added thusly: $directive->{ PARAMS }->{ $flag } = 0;

* Further modified _split_params() to protect multi-word quoted 
  sequences that may be values to pass to a function without being
  interpreted as many individual flags.  i.e. "foo bar baz" should
  *not* be interpreted as ("foo", "bar", "baz").

* Added "noprint" flag to BLOCK definition to prevent inclusion of the
  BLOCK definition in the processed output.  This changes in V0.10 where
  the default behaviour becomes "noprint" and printing is activated with 
  the "print" flag.  


#------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Version 0.03    Date: 1997/04/30 08:20:12
#------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Added ROGUE option to indicate how unrecognised tokens should be 
  handled.

* Added primitive LOOP construct.


#------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Version 0.04    Date: 1997/04/30 14:34:03
#------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Fully implemented LOOP construct.   LOOP segments are defined between 
  %% LOOP %% and %% ENDLOOP %% and _pre-process()'d into the symbol table 
  as LOOP.name (name defaults to a unique zero-padded 5-digit number).
  This is a test state.  Ideally, looping constructs should be built 
  into INCLUDE directives.  Lo and behold!  See the next comment...

* Removed LOOP directive (ha!) and built functionality into the standard
  INCLUDE directive.  This now supports the "repeat" flag, with an
  optional value (i.e. "repeat = 5").  Without the value, the parameters
  supplied to the INCLUDE are split by a delimiter (comma, ',' by 
  default, but can be set with "delimiter = <string>") and the loop 
  repeats until all the data has been used.  In the case that the block
  loops more times than a given parameter has values (i.e. repeat=5
  data="10,15,20") then the last value is repeated.  NOTE: LOOP constructs
  have since been removed from MetaText.  They may return one day.

* Formalised case sensitivity.  Keywords and special directive variables
  (e.g. REPEAT, IF, etc) are forced to upper case, parameter names to 
  lower case.  Identifiers (which may reference a case-sensitive external
  file) and parameter values are left as found.  
  (This changes again in version 0.5)

* Modified _parse_directive() to handle all special parameters in a 
  generic way.  Previously, a special function, _extract_conditional()
  was employed to identify "if=<condition>" statements.  This is no
  longer required.


#------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Version 0.05    Date: 1997/05/02 06:48:31
#------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Further enhanced ROGUE error reporting to re-insert cleaned-up version
  of original tag (default), delete the tag in entirety (delete) and
  in either case, warn about the bad token (warn).

* Changed case sensitivity handling (again).  I decided it was incorrect 
  to force all parameter names and identifiers to lower case.  Why not
  let the users deferentiate between "foo" and "FOO" if they want to?
  There is now a CASE configuration option.  If it evaluates true,
  MetaText runs in case-sensitive mode, preserving the case of all
  identifiers and parameters (except for directive control params such
  as REPEAT, DELIMITER etc. which are always forced to UPPER).  When
  CASE is false, all parameters and identifiers are converted to lower
  case.  This will cause problems if you try to INCLUDE an external
  file whose name is not fully lower case.  i.e. "INCLUDE Foo/Bar"
  becomes "INCLUDE foo/bar".  For this reason, case sensitive is the
  default mode.  This changes once again in version 0.17 where case
  sensitivity is finally rationalised once and for all (I hope).

* Modified _split_params() to allow single quotes ''' to be used to 
  encompass multi-word values in addition to the usual double quotes '"'.
  Cleaned up the regex code considerably, pre-defining various elements
  to make the final expression readable and easily understandable <gasp!>

* Modified _split_params() to allow variables to reference other 
  variables (e.g. alias = $name).  Added _interpolate_tags() to
  interpolate all these values before passing them to process(), 
  _substitute() and _evaluate.  Modified _evaluate() to understand and
  account for references and cleaned up much of the evaluation code.
  (This changes in version 0.6)
  
* Added DELIMITER option, allowing the user to specify the default 
  DELIMITER for splitting strings.  Specific delimiters can still be
  specified within individiual operations.

* Added some extra characters to the characters class that can delimit
  directories in a DIRECTORY or DATADIR string.  Currently [|;,:].


#------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Version 0.06    Date: 1997/05/02 14:43:18
#------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Fixed a minor bug in _tidy() that was stripping quotes from quoted
  parameter lists.

* Shifted lower case conversion (if $self->{ CASE }) out of 
  _split_params() and put it into _parse_directive() to allow slightly
  more flexibility in parameter parsing.

* Removed variable interpolation from basic block parameters.  It was 
  getting very complicated to track what was what.  Despite coding a
  reasonably elegant solution, I decided that it made the code more
  complex for very little gain.  Condition statements (if="<condition>")
  may include variable references as may INCLUDE identifiers, e.g.
  %% INCLUDE $name %%


#------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Version 0.07    Date: 1997/05/06 16:04:45
#------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Added generic _interpolate() function for expanding variable values
  within a string.  Block identifiers are now passed through this function
  to permit directives such as "%% INCLUDE $name %%".  Ambiguous names
  can be resolved by surrounding the variable name in braces, as per the
  Unix shell syntax.  e.g. "foo${bar}baz".

* Modified _evaluate() to use hash array to reference anonymous code
  subs to do comparisons (==, !=, <=, etc) and boolean operations 
  (and, or, xor, etc).  

* Quotes are implicitly removed from around absolute values in 
  conditional equations.  e.g. with the following conditional: 
  if="name=\"John Doe\"" the variable 'name' is implictly changed from
  '"John Doe"' to 'John Doe'.  The original escaped quotes *ARE* 
  required to quote the whitespace within the variable value.
   
* Added regex matching (=~ and !~) to _evaluate() function for 
  conditionals.

* Relaxed valid/invalid variable checking within _evaluate() to allow
  the simple expression 'if="$variable"' to simply return 0 if 
  $variable isn't defined rather than bleat about it.


#------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Version 0.08    Date: 1997/05/08 08:34:41
#------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Fixed bug where surrounding quotes weren't being stripped from if=""
  values in all cases.

* Changed _evalute() to evaluate parameter values (as well as parameter 
  names) case-insensitively unless CASE sensitive flag is set.
 
* Added "in" comparator in _evaluate() to determine if a value is in a 
  given list.  e.g. "$name in \"fred,tom,harry\"".  Uses the current
  DELIMITER value (or the default) to delimit the list.

* Changed name of debug function from _debug() to _DEBUG() to enhance 
  readability.


#------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Version 0.09    Date: 1997/05/15 09:13:00
#------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Added an "UNLESS" option to INCLUDE directives for convenience, 
  effectively giving the opposite to the "IF" directive.  An INCLUDE 
  directive may contain both an IF and an UNLESS statement in which 
  case, the IF is evaluated first, and the UNLESS second.  If the
  IF condition fails, the UNLESS will not be evaulated.  If the UNLESS
  evaluates true, the INCLUDE will be skipped, even if the IF condition
  returned TRUE. 

* Added INDEX directive to build a list of INCLUDE directives within a
  block.  This is removed in a later version, not least of all because
  it proved to be unwieldy and of limited use.

* Optimised and tidied up the main _process() loop.


#------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Version 0.10    Date: 1997/05/19 08:37:05
#------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Made a couple of minor changes to get Perl 5.004 running -w without 
  warnings.

* Enhanced _index() to only index INCLUDE directives whose identifiers
  match the "element=<regex>,<regex>..." pattern specified in the INDEX
  directive.  Case sensitivity to the pattern match depends on 
  $self->{ CASE }.

* Changed the rather generic "DIRECTORY" configuration option to 
  "ELEMPATH" (element path) which more accurately describes what it
  actually refers to.  Pity I couldn't get it right second time around -
  I change it to LIB in version 0.12.

* Finally fixed and rationalised the handling of carriage returns at
  the end of lines.  The problem was, particularly with DEFINE 
  directives, where the directive was removed during processing 
  leaving a blank line it it's place.  A number of DEFINE directives 
  on subsequent lines (as is quite common) leaves a great big chunk of 
  whitespace.  The solution is to ignore any carriage return that 
  occurs immediately after the closing directive magic token.  Any 
  trailing characters after the directive, including whitespace, will 
  get a carriage return added to it.  The original carriage return 
  gets eaten by the regex, in case you wondered what happened to it.

* Changed the "print" INCLUDE option (in which the print format could
  be specified) to be "format" which makes more sense, IMHO.

* Removed the print format and filter code out of process() and into
  it's own function, _post_process().  This has several advantages.
  Firstly, it means that the code can conveniently be called for other
  directives apart from INCLUDE (SUBST now passes it's output through
  the printf filter as well).  Secondly, the directive object itself 
  can be passed to _post_process() meaning that the "filter" and 
  "format" options can now be stored as internal directive values
  rather than entries in the tags table.

* Changed the print format code to attempt to recognise the difference
  between a printf() format and a time2str() format.  A format that
  matches "%[^s]" is passed through time2str() from Date::Format. Other
  formats containing no other marker than "%s" are assumed to be 
  printf() formats.  A special "%P" marker in the format is ignored, 
  but silently invokes the printf() option regardless. "%s" is handled
  identically by either printf() or time2str().

* Modified _substitute() slightly to look for certain tag(s) before 
  attempting to call the tag as a function.  The tag(s) and their 
  associated return values are: 

    TIME       Returns current system time in seconds sinch the epoch 

* Changed AUTOLOAD to return undef if the original (unresolvable)
  directive should be left as is.  The value is passed up through 
  _substitute() to the relevant SUBST block in _process().  The 
  original directive is reconstructed here and the _post_process()
  step is bypassed.

* Added POD documentation.


#------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Version 0.11    Date: 1997/07/22 10:18:15
#------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Fixed fix in AUTOLOAD that was keeping directives from being deleted 
  when ROGUE=delete was defined.

* Fixed bug in process() which was returning an output list rather than
  concatenating the contents when __END__ was detected.  The usual 
  return point had been changed some time ago.

* Added CHOMP configuration item which allows the user to specify the
  end-of-line processing behaviour.  With CHOMP defined to any true value, 
  a newline immediately following a directive will be chomped off.  
  Modified _pre_process() to handle this.

* Corrected, enhanced and added further POD documentation.

* Added 'postproc' debug flag for examining _post_process() activity
  and data.


#------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Version 0.12    Date: 1997/11/28 07:56:24
#------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Replaced the DEBUGLEVEL constant sub-routines for the new "use constant...";

* Updated the tests (a little).

* Added the EXECUTE configuration option to control how the processor 
  attempts to resolve unknown identifiers.  With EXECUTE true, the 
  _substitute() method tried to run it as a package method.  With EXECUTE
  set > 1, it will also try to run it as a function in the main package, 
  assuming that the previous method call failed.

* Added PRINT as a special directive parameter (for BLOCK) rather than have
  it as just another parameter.

* Re-organised the code a little, listing methods roughly in the order in
  which they're used.

* Replaced the "ELEMPATH" configuration variable with "LIB".

* Moved the revision history (this list) and the bugs/future enhancements
  lists into separate files: "Changes" and "Todo", respectively.

* Changes _parse_params() to unescape any escaped characters, rather than
  just quotes.


#------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Version 0.13    Date: 1997/12/05 15:58:02
#------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Modified Makefile.PL to install metapage as well.

* Updated and completed documentation for module.


#------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Version 0.14    Date: 1998/01/30 15:50:37
#------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Fixed some significant bugs in the _evaluate() method and added 'eval'
  script to test general evaluation conditions.

* Fixed regex comparitor match bug in _evaluate() which was causing the 
  simple evaluation 'if="variable"' to fail.

* Fixed a number of typos and made a few enhancements to the
  Text::MetaText documentation.

* Added documentation to metapage utility.


#------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Version 0.15    Date: 1998/02/04 08:57:14
#------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Added 'ignore' and 'accept' options to metapage (1.06)

* First public beta release.


#------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Version 0.16    Date: 1998/02/16 11:21:02
#------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Fixed 'FILETIME' bug in metapage which wasn't being set with '-t' option.

* Fixed another _evaluate() bug which caused conditionals of the form
  if="$undefined == 0" to return a false negative.

* Added above test to t/*/eval

* Separated directive parsing code out to the Text::MetaText::Directive
  module.  


#------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Version 0.17    Date: 1998/02/25 16:24:15
#------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Changed directory search order so that the current directory ('.') is 
  searched after the LIB directories.  This can be over-ridden by explicitly
  stating a file in the current directory as "./file"

* Added _symbol_name(), _symbol_defined() and _symbol_entry() to give 
  consistant access to the symbol table.  Operations that may modify the
  symbol name (such as case folding when working CASE insensitively) are
  now localised to _symbol_name().

* Added _variable_name() and _variable_value() to provide consistent access
  to variable names and values.  Support for CASE (in)sensitivity is 
  implemented here.  Modified _interpolate(), _integrate_params() and
  _substitute() to use them.

* Removed AUTOLOAD method and no longer derive Text::MetaText from 
  AutoLoader.  Previously, AUTOLOAD had been used to resolved 
  unrecognised SUBST symbols.  This is now handled inside _substitute().

* Added public methods process_file() and process_text().  The latter 
  processes the contents of the text string passed.  The original 
  process() function remains for backward compatibility but simply calls
  process_file().  Added the private _process() method which is called 
  by the above methods.

* Added private methods _parse_file(), _parse_text() and _parse() which 
  are called by the respective process_XXXX() methods.

* Added _get_line() and _unget_line() to act as lexical tokenisers for 
  feeding to _parse_XXXX() methods.

* Fixed bug in _parse() which was concatentating consecutive lines without
  adding spaces in between them.  

* Reworked and updated test suite.

* Fixed a copule of tyops in the domucentation.

* Modified metapage to work with the improved CASE sensitivity handling.
  It seems that CASE sensitive variable handling was largely broken.  I 
  never noticed because I never use it case sensitively.  Don't know
  why I ever implemented it really...  This is a quick kludge to get 
  it working until I get around to implementing CASEVARS in Version 0.18.

* Updated documentation to include new changes.


#------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Version 0.18    Date: 1998/03/13 15:22:48
#------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Changed ROGUE option to store a hash array of options rather than a 
  list which had to be grep'd every time.  Added a t/rogue.t test script
  and modified test.pl to include a post-processing hook so that the test
  script can write MetaText warnings/errors to the output file.  This can 
  then be compared against the expected output (t/expect/test.n) to see if
  the warning was expected or not.

* Added "__MTEND__" as an alias for "__END__".  Useful when defining a text 
  string in a script and you want to use "__END__" but can't because perl
  will think it's meant for it.

* Added CASEVARS configuration option which specifies a list of variables
  whose names _shouldn't_ be folded to lower case when running case 
  insensitively.  This is used by metapage to supply "system" variables
  such as FILENAME, FILETIME, FILEPATH, etc.  When defined as CASEVARS,
  they *must* be specified in the same (UPPER) case even if CASE sensitivity 
  is OFF.  The variables 'filename', 'filetime' and 'filepath' may also be 
  user defined and their definiton and use will not be affected by these 
  additional variables.  i.e. CASEVARS don't stomp on normal vars.

* Modified metapage to use CASEVARS option

* Updated documentation and cleaned up few miscellaneous rough edges


#------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Version 0.19    Date: 1998/04/02 09:25:16
#------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Rationalised error handling and added an internal ERROR variable to store
  error state.  "warnings" are reported via _warn() as per usual, and fatal
  errors are reported via a new method _error() which sets the internal 
  ERROR variable and then calls _warn() to report the error.  Any ERROR
  handling function defined is now stored in the ERRORFN internal rather 
  than the previous ERROR which is now used as described.  

* Updated metapage to version 1.11.  Changes include:

  - quoting values in config file [define] section is now ok
  - added "no execution" mode (-n)
  - better reporting of MetaText errors
  - improved file statistic and verbose messages
  - several miscellaneous improvements to internal code 
  - updated docs to reflect changes 

* Second public beta release consisting of:
   
    Text::MetaText             v0.19
    Text::MetaText::Directive  v0.02
    metapage                   v1.11
  

#------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Version 0.20    Date: 1998/04/07 16:14:51
#------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Fixed bug in _post_process() which was incorrectly treating an input of
  '0' as an undefined value and converting to ''.

* Added the public declare($input, $name) method which allows text strings 
  to be pre-parsed into the symbol table.  The method also allows $input to 
  be a reference to an array which can contain text strings or MetaText 
  Directive references as its elements.  This is effectively the 'compiled'
  or 'parsed' version of an input.  There is currently no way to cleanly
  create Directives for this, so using this form of declare() requires
  a little black magic until I get around to sorting out the Directive
  class.  The people who want to use it already know how to do it so they
  should be happy.

* Added test for declare() method.

* Minor documentation updates.


#------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Version 0.21    Date: 1998/04/28 15:31:56
#------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Added a MetaText Factory object (Text::MetaText::Factory) which is 
  responsible for parsing and creating directives.  This abstracts some
  of the code that was previously in Directive into an object which can 
  better manage the process (by trapping errors, for example).  It makes
  the MetaText module more configurable by allowing the Factory and 
  Directive classes to be sub-classed and bound into MetaText at run time.

* Removed parsing code from Directive class (Text::MetaText::Directive).
  The Directive class is now a simple data container serving as a suitable
  base class for derivation.

* Added a FACTORY configuration option to _configure() which allows a 
  Factory instance to be bound in at run time.  

* Added the _factory() method to return a reference to the internal 
  Factory instance.  If a Factory is _not_ bound at run time via the
  configuration option, FACTORY, then a default Factory object 
  (Text::MetaText::Factory) is created and stored the first time a 
  _factory() method call is made.

* Changed directive KEYWORD member to TYPE to better describe what it
  actually is.  Modified _parse() and _process() accordingly.


#------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Version 0.22    Date: 1998/09/01 11:23:14
#------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Added 4 pre-defined formats: dquoted, squoted, quoted (same as dquoted) 
  and money.  These are specified as such: %% whatshesaid format=quoted %%.

* Added _parse_error() method which adds file/line reporting to the error
  message passed.

* Removed all trailing newlines from error messages.  One is subsequently
  printed by the _warn() function but the message is stored without it.

* Added HAS_CONDITION and HAS_POSTPROC parameters to the Directive (added
  in the Directive constructor) that are used within _process() to 
  optimise the cases where conditionals and/or post-process formatting 
  aren't required.

* Doing the above tickled a well-hidden bug.  It seems that CHOMP wasn't
  doing exactly what it should in removing empty lines after directives.
  However, the _post_process() method was effectively reversing this
  process by chomping off the final newline.  When _post_process() 
  became optional, the bug showed itself and was duly whacked across the
  head with a large stick.

* Added TRIM configuration and directive parameters which follow a better
  heuristic for cleaning up extraneous newlines surrounding a BLOCK
  definition.  The CHOMP and TRIM behaviour really needs to be rationalised
  further.

* In implementing the above, I changed the way in which "control" 
  parameters are listed internally for various directives.  It is now
  possible to specify control params on a per-directive basis rather
  than the previous all-or-nothing approach.  This should make it easier 
  to extend the parameters for a specific directive without affecting the 
  others.

* Heavily updated the existing test suite and added a few more tests to 
  reflect the changes to CHOMP and TRIM.

* Fixed a bug in _process() which was causing the condition "if=0" to 
  return a false positive.

* Documented TRIM option and pre-defined format types: quoted, dquoted,
  squoted.  

* Documented declare() method and added "VARIABLE INTERPOLATION" section.

* Added the File::Recurse module to Makefile.PL as a pre-requisite for 
  metapage.

* Third public beta release consisting of:
   
    Text::MetaText             v0.22
    Text::MetaText::Directive  v0.04
    Text::MetaText::Factory    v0.02
    metapage                   v1.11
