METHODS

    This class inherits all methods from Mojo::EventEmitter

 new

    This method have two arguments by which you can costumize the behavior
    of the feed:

  sites

    which sites you want to connect. It is in fact the array reference of
    module names of Finance::Bitcoin::Feed::Site::*. Now there are the
    following sites: Hitbtc BtcChina CoinSetter LakeBtc BitStamp

    You can also put your own site module under this namespace and added
    here.

  output

    customize the output format by giving this argument a sub reference. It
    will be bind to the event 'output'. Please rever to the event <output>.

       # you can customize the output by giving argument 'output' to the new methold
        open  my $fh, ">out.txt";
        $fh->autoflush();
        my $feed = Finance::Bitcoin::Feed->new(output => sub{
           my ($self, $site, $timestamp, $currency, $price) = @_;
           print $fh "the price currency $currency on site $site is $price\n";
        });
        # let's go!
        $feed->run();

EVENTS

    This class inherits all events from Mojo::EventEmitter and add the
    following new ones:

 output

    This event has a default subscriber:

       #output to the stdout, the default action:
       $feed->on('output', sub { shift; say join " ", @_ } );

    You can customize the output by giving argument 'output' to the new
    method

        open  my $fh, ">out.txt";
        $fh->autoflush();
        my $feed = Finance::Bitcoin::Feed->new(output => sub{
           my ($self, $site, $timestamp, $currency, $price) = @_;
           print $fh "the price currency $currency on site $site is $price\n";
        });
        # let's go!
        $feed->run();

    Or you can bind output directly to the feed to get multi outout or you
    should unscribe this event first.

        $feed->on('output', sub {....})

    The arguments of this event is:

    $self: the site class object timestamp: the timestamp of the data. If
    no timestamp is given by the site, then the value of it is 0. sitename:
    the site class name price: the price

DEBUGGING

    You can set the FINANCE_BITCOIN_FEED_DEBUG environment variable to get
    some advanced diagnostics information printed to STDERR. And these
    modules use Mojo::UserAgent, you can also open the MOJO_USERAGENT_DEBUG
    environment variable:

       FINANCE_BITCOIN_FEED_DEBUG=1
       MOJO_USERAGENT_DEBUG=1
