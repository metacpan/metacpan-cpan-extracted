     Thanks to Chris Nighswonger and Stefan Seifert.
     Added C/t/21read_DATA.t and C/t/22read_DATA_2.t as the test cases.
     NOTE: This is not a complete fix - it's still possible to
	   write code (albeit in an unorthodox fashion) such
	   that a non-marker can be treated as a marker.

0.45_02 Fri Feb 5 2010
 - Changes to Inline.pm, denter.pm, and Inline.pod relating to "fixing"
   untainting (to the extent that untainting of -T inline scripts works as

 - Minor doc fixes.

0.44 Mon Oct 28 10:31:51 PST 2002
 - Doc fixes. Thanks Mitchell.
 - Put all current ILSMs in doc and Makefile.PL
 - Applied some patches from Patrick LeBoutillier, including one to make
   things work out of the box on Win95 and friends. Rob helped too.
 - Added a warning to help debug why certain ILSMs might be failing.
 - Changes to Inline-FAQ
 - Fixed ParseRecDescent to handle 'unsigned foo()' and 'long foo()'
 - Updated README
 - Fixed %INC problem
 - Used File::Spec::Unix for %INC keys (which are always in Unix form)
 - Applied Mitchell's patch for Inline::C::ParseRegExp
 - Updated pod docs
 - Shortened BUILD_TIMER precision, per Leon Brocard's suggestion.
 - Applied Mitchell Charity's patch to fix Piers Harding's CPP problem.
 - Fixed bug with USING keyword
 - Added the USING keyword. This allows you to specify a list of modules
   which can override certain parts of the Inline process.
 - Added Inline::C::ParseRecDescent and Inline::C::ParseRegExp to provide
   two (hopefully) functionally identical C parsers. You use one of these
   by saying 'use Inline C => DATA => USING => "ParseRegExp"'. Big thanks
   to Mitchell Charity for ParseRegExp. It's over two orders of magnitude
   faster than ParseRecDescent.
 - Added the more diagnostics to BUILD_NOISY.
 - Added BUILD_TIMERS for benchmarking the Inline build process.
 - Applied a (BIG) patch to the Inline distribution to use File::Spec to
   manipulate all file paths. Thanks Mitchell Charity!
 - Fixed a bug in OS X. Inline::C was being required even if the object was
   cached. That's because Inline.pm wasn't checking for .bundle.
 - Added an option to Inline::C called BUILD_NOISY. Setting this to true
   will cause the build process to dump output to the screen instead of to
   a file. You can set it with 'BUILD_NOISY => 1,' or 'ENABLE =>
   "BUILD_NOISY"'.
 - Honor the PERL_INLINE_BUILD_NOISY environment variable, to do the same
   as above. Environment variable has higher precedence.
 - Print the contents of 'out.make' to the screen on failure. This will
   happen when BUILD_NOISY is off. When its on, you'll see the messages in
   real time, but they won't go to 'out.make'.
 - Provide the NOISY shortcut so you can say 'perl -MInline=force,noisy
   foo.pl'.
 - Inline::MakeMaker uses the NOISY shortcut for its build command. This
   way module builds are noisy like they should be.
 - Integrated the new improved Inline::MakeMaker
 - WriteInlineMakefile is deprecated for WriteMakefile
 - Added a patch by Rafael Garcia-Suarez to use $^X when
   $Config::Config{perlpath} is wrong. (It happens)
 - Refactored the Parse::RecDescent grammar
 - Moved grammar module to Inline::C::recdescent
 - Support 'const' in types. Requested by Nicholas Clark
 - Other modifiers seemed to be busted. Like 'unsigned'. Got them working.
 - Started integrating Mitchell Charity's parser. Don't know how to turn it
   on yet. It's currently in Inline::C::charity
 - Allow C++ based modules to be installed as well as C ones. Requested by
   Piers Harding.
 - Call validate() for interpreted ILSMs even on load(). This patch is
   dedicated to the very patient Mark Fowler who waited almost a year for
   it. I hope that never happens again.

0.43 Sat Jul 21 14:58:46 PDT 2001
 - Removed *old* deprecated functionality.
 - Inline now works with *all* Perl release versions 5.005 and above.
 - I was comparing a version number to a md5 hash. Oops. Thanks Marcel.
 - Changed M51 error message which was causing confusion. It would often
   come up in places I didn't anticipate.
 - Use $Config{dlext} instead of $Config{so}. Thanks Marcel.

0.42 Sun Jun 10 18:21:06 PDT 2001
 - Re-fixed config generator path bug prevents ILSMs like I::Python and
   I::Tcl from installing. (NEILW)

0.41 Tue Jun  5 00:23:46 PDT 2001
 - Don't install .inline or .inl files with Inline::MakeMaker. Require
   object name to be same as package name for installation. Put hack in
   INIT block to fix Sarathy's patch ;)
 - Fixed config generator path bug that would prevent other ILSMs from
   installing. Thanks Patrick.
 - Applied patch to (hopefully) handle CRLF variations properly. Thanks
   Binkley

0.40 Sun May 27 18:59:59 PDT 2001
 - Bugfix. NAME not set right without AUTONAME.
 - TRIAL8 of Inline-0.40 Added option to distribute binary PPM modules with
   or without source. Got UNTAINT to work again.
 - TRIAL7 of Inline-0.40 Fixed path bus for MacOS. Thanks Marcel. 'with'
   works again (with Event) Inline::MakeMaker adds WriteMakefile dependency
   for Inline 0.40
 - TRIAL6 of Inline-0.40
 - Made Denter YAML compliant
 - Croak on usage of SITE_INSTALL
 - Update Inline.pod for 0.40 features
 - Detect and croak on old config files
 - TRIAL5 of Inline-0.40
 - Added alpha support for Inline::Files
 - Made all internal path names canonical
 - Finished TRIAL1 version of Inline-0.40
 - Short object names
 - Safer config generation
 - AUTONAME support
 - Reinstituted AutoLoading
 - Put all messages into subroutines inside Inline.pm
 - Completely reorganized the Inline internal object into major groups
 - API - Contract space for the ILSMs. Guaranteed backwards compatible
   after Inline 1.00.
 - ILSM - Private space for ILSMs
 - INLINE - Private Inline space. Subject to constant change.
 - CONFIG - Config options. Not for use by ILSMs
 - MATCH - Matching criteria for the object.
 - STRUCT - Reserved for Inline::Struct
 - Added command proxy logic for Inline::MakeMaker utilities INSTALL,
   MAKEDIST, MAKEPPD
 - Got _INSTALL_ option working with Inline::MakeMaker
 - Replaced Inline's use of Data::Dumper with Inline::Denter. This is a
   stripped down version of Data::Denter. This change makes Inline more
   secure because it doesn't need to eval() untrusted code. Also removes
   the dependency on Safe.pm which has known security flaws. Yay!

0.33 Sat Apr 28 20:20:29 PDT 2001
 - Use 'require FindBin' instead of 'use FindBin' for mod_perl.
 - Fixed Win32 bug. Drive letter 'c:' can be lower case.

0.32 Mon Feb 26 07:44:34 PST 2001
 - Add DIRECTORY path to applicable warnings and error msgs
 - Warn if UNTAINT && SAFEMODE && ! DIRECTORY (croak if root)
 - Added GLOBAL_LOAD option with GLOBAL shortcut.
 - Added SAFEMODE option.
 - Safe->reval(DIRECTORY/config) if SAFE.
 - Blindly untaint all %ENV variables for UNTAINT.
 - Fixed MSWin32 bug of getting full path parts in dll name.
 - Fixed the "cut & paste" bug. (DOS line endings in Unix.)
 - Fixed detection of using Inline::Config.
 - Added UNTAINT option, which lets you use Inline with Perl's -T flag.

0.31 Fri Jan 19 00:13:31 PST 2001
 - Changed doc instances of 'C<Inline>' to 'Inline'.
 - Reorganized the internal structure of the Inline DIRECTORY

0.26 Thu Sep 14 20:51:11 PDT 2000
 - localize $/ and $\ to shield them from things like 'perl -l'. Thanks
   Michael Schwern.

0.25 Fri Sep  1 10:07:33 PDT 2000
 - Use MD5 on unmodified code only. User must force recompile if
   auto_headers change. This would have caused existing installs to break.
 - Don't determine build path unless really needed, since a blib_I might be
   created. This might be annoying for someone who is only *using* an
   Inline extension module.
 - Mangle $VERSION into object name for modules
 - Support Inline->import(C=><DATA>); syntax
 - Return an empty list when the C function is of type void and doesn't use
   any stack manipulating macros. (ie dXSARGS) It used to return whatever
   was passed in on the stack. :-(
 - Force rebuild when SITE_INSTALL option is set.
 - Figured out what was actually causing the 0.23 AutoLoader bug.
 - Can't autoload from "./blib" (relative path) when chdir() has been used.
   Fixed properly now. Can AutoLoad fix_make() again. :-)

0.24 Fri Aug 18 03:03:06 PDT 2000
 - Fixed Autoload bug found during "make test" of Inline installation.

0.23 Wed Aug 16 18:10:07 PDT 2000
 - Added support for MSWin32 operating systems which use the Microsoft
   Visual C++ compiler.

0.22 Wed Aug  9 18:55:54 PDT 2000
