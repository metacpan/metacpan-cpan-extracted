    brute force search script).  Result builds and passes all tests on

Spider Boardman <spider@orb.nashua.nh.us>  1998-03-01 02:02:47
	Almost OK: 5.004_61 (threads, perlio)

Gurusamy Sarathy <gsar@cpan.org>  1998-02-26 03:56:19
    [win32] various cleanups so that B can be built as "just another extension"
     - export symbols needed for building B
     - bset_obj_store() is needed by byterun(), so define it there instead
       of at B.xs, and export it
     - freadpv() is only used in B.xs, so move it there
     - byte*.h are now included by perl.h
     - regenerate embed*.h

Gurusamy Sarathy <gsar@cpan.org>  1998-02-22 02:40:56
    [win32] get compiler building under win32 (needed Makefile.PL
    hacks that could be applicable to other platforms)

Malcolm Beattie <mbeattie@sable.ox.ac.uk>  1998-02-25 17:44:34
	More compiler tweaks.

Malcolm Beattie <mbeattie@sable.ox.ac.uk>  1998-02-20 18:23:47
    Remove compiler files from their old lib/B locations. The compiler
    now builds by default (without the byteperl executable so far) and
    seems to work at least minimally.

Malcolm Beattie <mbeattie@sable.ox.ac.uk>  1998-02-20 18:05:33
    Move lib/B/... and lib/[BO].pm over to where they should be,
    under ext/B.
    
Malcolm Beattie <mbeattie@sable.ox.ac.uk>  1998-02-20 17:54:58
    Start getting compiler to work when built with the core.
    [Still won't work as of this change.]

Malcolm Beattie <mbeattie@sable.ox.ac.uk>  1998-02-20 16:42:13

	* Merge perlext/Compiler/... into mainline. Some files move to
    ext/B/..., some to lib/B/..., O.pm and B.pm go in lib and some
    move to the base perl directory (e.g. headers). Will need some
    cleaning up before it builds properly, I would guess.

Malcolm Beattie <mbeattie@sable.ox.ac.uk>  1998-02-20 16:39:38
	* [compiler] Win32 changes from Sarathy, tweaked slightly by me.

Malcolm Beattie <mbeattie@sable.ox.ac.uk>  1998-02-17 17:50:50
	* Assorted changes to the compiler

Malcolm Beattie <mbeattie@sable.ox.ac.uk>  1997-12-17 10:59:40
	* Fix typo in compiler B/C.pm.

Alpha5 Malcolm Beattie <mbeattie@sable.ox.ac.uk>  1997-12-10 18:33:53
	* Start overhauling compiler. It was working at least minimally
    right up until the final tweak of B.xs to add threadsv_names
    at which point building it provokes a seg fault in perl while
    doing the xsubpp :-(.

Malcolm Beattie <mbeattie@sable.ox.ac.uk>  1997-09-03 12:31:48
	* Make compiler build/work with devel 5.005

Malcolm Beattie <mbeattie@sable.ox.ac.uk>  1997-07-05 11:58:05  
	* Change %lx to %x in B::CV::save to prevent some CV
    fields becoming 0 in the init section. Add missing
    write_back in B::Stackobj::Padsv::load_double to fix
    test 22 of op/my.t.

a4 Malcolm Beattie <mbeattie@sable.ox.ac.uk>  1997-05-03 14:47:06  
	* initial check in of compiler
	from version Alpha a3 to a4
