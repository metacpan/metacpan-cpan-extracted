SYNOPSIS

        use Emailesque qw(
            email
        );
    
        email {
            to      => '...',
            from    => '...',
            subject => '...',
            message => '...',
        };

DESCRIPTION

    Emailesque provides an easy way of handling text or html email messages
    with or without attachments. Simply define how you wish to send the
    email, then call the email keyword passing the necessary parameters as
    outlined above. This module is basically a wrapper around the email
    interface Email::Stuffer. The following is an example of the
    object-oriented interface:

OVERVIEW

        use Emailesque;
    
        my $email = Emailesque->new(
            to      => '...',
            from    => '...',
            subject => '...',
            message => '...',
            files   => [ '/path/to/file/1', '/path/to/file/2' ],
        );
    
        my $result = $email->send;
    
        if ($result->isa('Email::Sender::Failure')) {
            die $result->message;
        }

    The Emailesque object-oriented interface is designed to accept
    parameters at instatiation and when calling the send method. This
    allows you to build-up an email object with a few base parameters, then
    create and send multiple email messages by calling the send method with
    only the unique parameters. The following is an example of that:

        use Emailesque;
    
        my $email = Emailesque->new(
            from     => '...',
            subject  => '...',
            x_mailer => "MyApp-Newletter 0.019876",
            x_url    => "https://mail.to/u/123/welcome",
            type     => 'text',
        );
    
        for my $user (@users) {
            my $message = msg_generation $user;
            $email->send({ to => $user, message => $message });
        }

    The default email format is plain-text, this can be changed to html by
    setting the option 'type' to 'html'. The following are options that can
    be passed within the hashref of arguments to the keyword, constructor
    and/or the send method:

        # send message to
        $email->to('...')
    
        # send messages from
        $email->from('...')
    
        # email subject
        $email->subject('...')
    
        # message body
        $email->message('...') # html or text data
    
        # email message content type (type: text, html, or multi)
        $email->send({ type => 'text' })
    
        # message multipart content
        $email->type('multi') # must set type to multi
        $email->message({ text => $text_message, html => $html_messase })
    
        # carbon-copy other email addresses
        $email->send({ cc => 'user@site.com' })
        $email->send({ cc => 'usr1@site.com, usr2@site.com, usr3@site.com' })
        $email->send({ cc => [qw(usr1@site.com usr2@site.com usr3@site.com)] })
    
        # blind carbon-copy other email addresses
        $email->send({ bcc => 'user@site.com' })
        $email->send({ bcc => 'usr1@site.com, usr2@site.com, usr3@site.com' })
        $email->send({ bcc => [qw(usr1@site.com usr2@site.com usr3@site.com)] })
    
        # specify where email responses should be directed
        $email->send({ reply_to => 'other_email@website.com' })
    
        # attach files to the email
        $email->send({ files => [ $file_path_1, $file_path_2 ] })
    
        # attach files to the email (and specify attachment name)
        # set attachment name to undef to use the filename
        $email->send({ attach => [ $file_path => $attachment_name ] })
        $email->send({ attach => [ $file_path => undef ] })
    
        # send additional headers explicitly
        $email->send({ headers  => { 'X-Mailer' => '...' } })
    
        # send additional headers implicitly
        $email->send({ x_mailer => '...' } # simpler

    The default email transport is sendmail. This can be changed by
    specifying a different driver parameter, e.g. smtp, as well as any
    additional arguments required by the transport:

        # send mail via smtp
        $email->send({
            ...,
            driver  => 'smtp',
            host    => 'smtp.googlemail.com',
            user    => 'account@gmail.com',
            pass    => '****'
        })
    
        # send mail via smtp via Google (gmail)
        $email->send({
            ...,
            ssl     => 1,
            driver  => 'smtp',
            host    => 'smtp.googlemail.com',
            port    => 465,
            user    => 'account@gmail.com',
            pass    => '****'
        })
    
        # send mail via smtp via Mailchimp (mandrill)
        $email->send({
            ...,
            ssl     => 0,
            driver  => 'smtp',
            host    => 'smtp.mandrillapp.com',
            port    => 587,
            user    => 'account@domain.com',
            pass    => '****'
        })
    
        # send mail via sendmail
        # path is optional if installed in a standard location
        $email->send({
            ...,
