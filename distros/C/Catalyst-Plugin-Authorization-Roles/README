NAME
    Catalyst::Plugin::Authorization::Roles - Role based authorization for
    Catalyst based on Catalyst::Plugin::Authentication

SYNOPSIS
        use Catalyst qw/
            Authentication
            Authorization::Roles
        /;

        sub delete : Local {
            my ( $self, $c ) = @_;

            $c->assert_user_roles( qw/admin/ ); # only admins can delete

            $c->model("Foo")->delete_it();
        }

DESCRIPTION
    Role based access control is very simple: every user has a list of
    roles, which that user is allowed to assume, and every restricted part
    of the app makes an assertion about the necessary roles.

    With "assert_user_roles", if the user is a member in all of the required
    roles access is granted. Otherwise, access is denied. With
    "assert_any_user_role" it is enough that the user is a member in one
    role.

    There are alternative approaches to do this on a per action basis, see
    Catalyst::ActionRole::ACL.

    For example, if you have a CRUD application, for every mutating action
    you probably want to check that the user is allowed to edit. To do this,
    create an editor role, and add that role to every user who is allowed to
    edit.

        sub edit : Local {
            my ( $self, $c ) = @_;
            $c->assert_user_roles( qw/editor/ );
            $c->model("TheModel")->make_changes();
        }

    When this plugin checks the roles of a user it will first see if the
    user supports the self check method.

    When this is not supported the list of roles is extracted from the user
    using the "roles" method.

    When this is supported, the "check_roles" method will be used to
    delegate the role check to the user class. Classes like the one provided
    with iCatalyst::Authentication::Store::DBIx::Class optimize the check
    this way.

METHODS
    assert_user_roles [ $user ], @roles
        Checks that the user (as supplied by the first argument, or, if
        omitted, "$c->user") has the specified roles.

        If for any reason ("$c->user" is not defined, the user is missing a
        role, etc) the check fails, an error is thrown.

        You can either catch these errors with an eval, or clean them up in
        your "end" action.

    check_user_roles [ $user ], @roles
        Takes the same args as "assert_user_roles", and performs the same
        check, but instead of throwing errors returns a boolean value.

    assert_any_user_role [ $user ], @roles
        Checks that the user (as supplied by the first argument, or, if
        omitted, "$c->user") has at least one of the specified roles.

        Other than that, works like "assert_user_roles".

    check_any_user_role [ $user ], @roles
        Takes the same args as "assert_any_user_role", and performs the same
        check, but instead of throwing errors returns a boolean value.
