DESCRIPTION

    POE::Component::SmokeBox::Uploads::RSS is a POE component that alerts
    newly uploaded CPAN distributions. It obtains this information from
    polling an RSS feed ( by default http://search.cpan.org/uploads.rdf.

    POE::Component::RSSAggregator is used to handle the RSS feed monitoring
    and POE::Component::Client::HTTP used to obtain the full author path
    for each new upload.

CONSTRUCTOR

    spawn

      Takes a number of parameters:

        'event', the event handler in your session where each new upload alert should be sent, mandatory;
        'session', optional if the poco is spawned from within another session;

      The 'session' parameter is only required if you wish the output event
      to go to a different session than the calling session, or if you have
      spawned the poco outside of a session.

      Returns an object.

METHODS

    session_id

      Returns the POE::Session ID of the component.

    shutdown

      Terminates the component.

INPUT EVENTS

    shutdown

      Terminates the component.

OUTPUT EVENTS

    An event will be triggered for each new CPAN upload. The event will
    have ARG0 set to the path of the upload:

      B/BI/BINGOS/POE-Component-SmokeBox-Uploads-RSS-0.01.tar.gz

    Suitable for feeding to the smoke tester of your choice.
