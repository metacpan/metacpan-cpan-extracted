Revision history for Perl module Perl::Metrics::Simple

0.19 - March 2021
  Merged JSON output option contributed by Saturo Abe (https://github.com/polamjag)
  Moved generation of the plain text, HTML, and JSON into new modules:
        Perl::Metrics::Simple::Output::HTML
        Perl::Metrics::Simple::Output::JSON
        Perl::Metrics::Simple::Output::PlainText

0.18 - January 2015
  Merged changes by mephinet to support better reporting for projects
  using Moose, so that a method declared as 'foo' => sub {...} will
  be reported as a sub named _around_foo instead of being counted
  as part of the "Code not in any subroutine"
  Pull request was: https://github.com/matisse/Perl-Metrics-Simple/pull/5

0.17 - November 2012
  Merten Falk - Added default values for subroutine metrics if
  there is no subroutine.
  
  Clarified terms of license, updated FSF address: 
    https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=80463

  countperl now utilizes Pod::Usage for diagnostic and new --help option

0.15
  Changes for https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=56441
  Thanks to Maggie J. Xiong for the inquiry, inspiration and patch.

  You can now set:
    @Perl::Metrics::Simple::Analysis::File::LOGIC_KEYWORDS and OPERATORS
  to custom values before creating a new 
    Perl::Metrics::Simple::Analysis::File object.

  Added to the default @LOGIC_KEYWORDS used in calculating complexity:
    map
    grep

  Added to the default @LOGIC_OPERATORS used in calculating complexity:
    !~
    //
    <
    <=>
    ==
    =~
    >
    cmp
    eq
    gt
    lt
    ne
    ~~

  Added two accessors on Perl::Metrics::Simple::Analysis::File to obtain
  the values in use: 
    logic_keywords()
    logic_operators()

0.14
  Allow using a ref-to-SCALAR of file contents instead of a file path.

 Better documentation about measuring complexity.

0.031 - Thu Dec 14 09:05:15 PST 2006
 Fixed bug in the  countperl  script. Was reporting the median instead
 of mean for the summary complexity numbers.
 Thanks to Ovid for spotting this.

0.03 - Sat Dec  2 09:01:41 PST 2006
 The "main" stats for each file now have the same format as the stats for
 a subroutine: Added 'name' and 'path' keys to the hash.
 The 'name' is always:     {code not in named subroutines}

 Changed the 'countperl' script to use the new data structure to add
 the {code not in named subroutines} to the list of subroutines it reports.

0.022 - Sun Nov 26 22:08:47 PST 2006
 Line counts now exclude blank lines, comments and pod.
 Complexity counts now will be 0 (zero) for code that is only comments/pod.

0.021 - Sat Nov 25 22:46:23 PST 2006
 Mostly changes to improve Kwalitee. See http://cpants.perl.org/kwalitee.html
 Added pod.
 Added tests for Pod and Pod coverage.

0.02
  Refactored much code into new Perl::Metrics::Simple::Analysis::File
  Added summary_stats() method to Perl::Metrics::Simple::Analysis
     provides min/max/mean/median/standard_deviation info.
  Added  '!' and  'not' to list of logic operators that add t complexity scores.
  Installs new script 'countperl' which creates report in text format.
  Made various changes to satisfy perlcritic.
  Made a change to list_perl_files() to work with old versions of File::Find.
