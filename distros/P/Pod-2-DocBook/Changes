  0.0.6
  =====

      o Support for L<> style linking, includes new Id naming scheme

      o additional styles, variable headx->secty mapping

      o removed unneccessary <para></para> pairs

      o fixed index building (but don't use this)

      o general de-HTML-ization

  0.0.5
  =====

      o Added an incremental fix from Pod::HTML which corrected bogus output
        in C<0>, B<0> and so on tags.

  0.0.4
  =====

      o Added handling for auto-tag generation

  0.0.3
  =====

      o POD files such as:

          =head1 Some Chapter Title

          blah

        will format the first =head1 tag as a <chapter> tag and automatically
        fill in the final </chapter> for you when run with --no-header and
        --no-footer

      o =over/=item/=back handling cleaned up a bit to produce correct
        <variablelist>, <orderedList> and <itemizedList> constructs

      o Added basic auto-tagging handling.

      o Added --root-id argument to specify the root tag id

      o Removed <A> tags which were an overhang from pod2html
