Tree-AVL version 1.077
=====================

An implementation of an AVL tree for storing comparable objects.  
AVL Trees are balanced binary trees, first introduced
in "An Algorithm for the Organization of Information" by 
Adelson-Velskii and Landis in 1962.

Balance is kept in an AVL tree during insertion and
deletion by maintaining a 'balance' factor in each node.

If the subtree below any node in the tree is evenly balanced,
the balance factor for that node will be 0.    
When the right-subtree below a node is taller than the left-subtree,
the balance factor will be 1.  For the opposite case, the balance
factor will be -1.

If the either subtree is heavier (taller by more than 2 levels) than the 
other, the balance factor within the node will be set to (+-)2, 
and the subtree below that node will be rebalanced.  

Re-balancing is done via 'single' or 'double' rotations, each of which
takes constant-time.

Insertion into an AVL tree will require at most 1 rotation.

Deletion from an AVL tree may take as much as log(n) rotations
in order to restore balance.

Balanced trees can save time in your programs
when used instead of regular flat data-structures.  For example, if 
you are processing as much as 1,125,899,906,842,624 (a quadrillion) 
ordered objects, the time (number of comparisons) required to access 
one of those objects will be on the order of 1,125,899,906,842,624 in 
the worst case if you keep them in a flat data structure.    However, 
using a balanced tree such as a 2-3 tree, a Red-Black tree or an AVL 
tree, the worst-case time (comparisons) required will be 50.  

Example usage
=====================

 use Tree::AVL;
 
 #######################################################
 #
 #  Example 1
 #  This example shows usage with default constructor.
 #
 #  With default constructor, the tree works with strings.
 #
 #  Constructor can also be passed a comparison function,
 #  and accessor methods to use, so that you can store any
 #  type of object in the tree (see Example 2).

 #######################################################
 
 # create a tree with default constructor
 my $avltree = Tree::AVL->new();
 
 # can insert strings by default

 $avltree->insert("montana");

 print $avltree->get_height() . "\n";  # output: 2 (height is zero-based)
 
 $avltree->print("*"); # output:
                       #

 #
 #  Example 2
 #
 #  instantiate tree and specify key, data and
 #  comparison functions.   insert any object
 #  you want.   Here a basic hash is used, but 
 #  any object of your creation will do when you 
 #  supply an appropriate comparison function.
 #
 #  Note: whereas in this example, anonymous subroutines are
 #  passed in to the constructor, you can just as well supply
 #  your own object's comparison methods-   i.e.,
 #
 #  $avltree = Tree::AVL->new(
 #          fcompare => \&MyObj::compare,
 #           
 #          . . . 
 #           
 #          etc...
