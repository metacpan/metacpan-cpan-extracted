2.11 Mon 31 July 2006

SVN revision 519

Deprecated:
    Directly accessing the attributes of the request object, or the parameters 
    in $r->params, or anything else, is DEPRECATED and likely to break in future 
    releases. Be good, and use proper method calls.

    Maypole no longer uses Class::DBI::AsForm, instead Maypole::Model::CDBI::AsForm
    has replaced it.

    $config->{$table}{required_cols} is deprecated, please use $class->required_columns instead


Incompatible API changes:
    Maypole
	 - is_applicable() deprecated for is_model_applicable(). is_applicable is
         an alias for is_model_applicable now.
    Maypole::Constants
	 - ERROR constant now 500, previously -1 (bug #18901)
    Maypole::Model
	- delete and search actions are now deprecated - use do_search and do_delete
	  instead
    Maypole::View
	- table name rather than moniker is used to find templates

API additions and enhancements:
    Maypole::Application:
    	- -Init flag (wishlist 14123)
        - recognises Maypole::HTTPD and installs Maypole::HTTPD::Frontend
            as its frontend
    Maypole::Headers:
    	add() alias to push() (wishlist 14142)
    Maypole:
        - get_session() method (no-op)
        - get_user() method (no-op)
        - get_session() is called during handler_guts() before authenticate()
        - new preprocess_path() method added and called by parse_path(), 
	        parse_path() will leave any properties set by preprocess_path() in 
            place
        - start_request_hook() added
        - status() attribute added (though only used by start_request_hook() 
            so far)
        - setup() split into setup(), setup_model(), and load_model_subclass()
        - added new path processing methods for ssl and default table/action
        - added make_path() 
        - added make_uri()
	- improved exception handling
	- now uses File::MMagic::XS to guess mime type of output unless already set
	- new component method provides Maypole::Component functionality
	- new object method gets/sets first/only object in objects
     Maypole::Model
	- do_delete, do_search in place of delete/search actions
     Maypole::View::TT:
	- new report_error method
	- new embedded error report page in __DATA__
     Templates:
        - Improved pager macro/include
	- Improved factory templates
        - added the status() attribute, although it's not used in many places 
            yet
	- Changed factory edit/view to use object instead of objects
     Maypole::Model::CDBI
	- improved error messages in do_edit action
        - new required_columns mutator method
        - new column_required accessor method

    Template xhtml validation (bug 13975)
    Apache2 fixes in Apache::MVC (bug 13888)
    Fixed inheritance issues in Mp::Application - Mp::App now manipulates the 
        caller's @ISA directly, and doesn't inject itself into the chain (bugs 
        12923 & 14120)
    Improved Template error reporting (14133)

    Templates:
    - factory/addnew will only prefill values when there's a row creation error


2.08  Mon Jan 24 20:45:00 2005
    - Added $r->config->template_extension() to set optional file extension
      for templates (Dave Howorth)

    Fixes:
    - Maypole::Application adds plugin classes to caller's @ISA (Marcus Ramberg)
    - FETCH_CODE_ATRIBUTES in M::M::Base should return an empty list if there
      are no attributes
    - M::M::CDBI will warn() about Class::DBI::FromCGI errors
    

2.07  Sun Jan 16 18:45:00 2005
    (This version was not uploaded to CPAN)

    Internal changes:
    - Removed Maypole::Model->description. It didn't work as expected and
      clashed with 'description' columns in the database

    Fixes:
    - Model->process() shouldn't set $r->objects() to a list with a single,
      undefined element
    - Fixed overriding $r->template_args->{classmetadata} in M::V::Base
      (Thanks to Dave Howorth for spotting the mistake)
    - #9473: Maypole::Model::CDBI->related_class (Thanks David Baird)
    - #9434: M::M::CDBI->search generated "uninitialized value" warnings

    Templates:
    - The addnew template will attempt to prefill form fields with request
      parameters
    - edit template includes 'addnew' if there is no object to edit

2.06  Wed Dec 29 01:30:00 2004
    Fixes:
    - Minor restructuring of the manual so search.cpan.org indexes it better
    - #9129: Skip t/apache_mvc.t if Apache::Request isn't installed
    

2.05  Fri Dec 24 03:20:00 2004
    - Revised and updated documentation. Many thanks to Dave Howorth for his
      hard work and 120kb documentation patches.
    - Added support for request and response HTTP headers with
      $r->headers_in & $r->headers_out (Maypole::Headers)
    - Support for compound primary keys for Maypole::Model::CDBI classes
    - Template toolkit objects are configurable with M::Config->view_options
    - Templating performance should be improved when running Maypole with
      mod_perl since compiled templates remain in memory. CGI users can use
      TT2's COMPILE_DIR or COMPILE_EXT options with
      Maypole::Config->view_options to improve performance

    Internal changes:
    - Added a new override for the model: fetch_objects(). 
    - 'classmetadata' template variables can now be overriden individually
    - New unit tests for Maypole, CGI::Maypole, Maypole::Headers, and others.
      More to come.

    - Check if has_a actually points to a Maypole::Model (Dave Howorth)
    - Make test suite work with DBD::SQLite2
    - default search() action removes empty fields from search parameters
    - #6622 - Maypole::Application will create a separate Maypole::Config for
      each application (instead of the current workaround for multiple apps
      under mod_perl)
    - #7643 - improve M::V::Base's error() messages. prefix error with label,
      and carp()
    - #7651 - minor POD improvements in M::M::CDBI (Dave Howorth)
    - #7834 - minor POD update in M::M::CDBI (Kevin Connor)
