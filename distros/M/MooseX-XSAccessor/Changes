0.008	2017-05-01

 [ Test Suite ]
 - Update tests for more recent Moose versions.

0.007	2013-10-30

 [ Test Suite ]
 - Skip the new version of moose_bad_coerce.t if Moose version is too old.

0.006	2013-10-30

 [ Test Suite ]
 - Avoid triggering silly deprecation warnings from
   MooseX::Attribute::Chained.
 - Pull latest attribute tests from Moose; the old versions of these test
   cases broke with Moose 2.11xx.

 [ Documentation ]
 - Document the circumstances under which predicates and clearers can be
   acceleated (respectively: if Class::XSAccessor is new enough, and
   never).

 [ Packaging ]
 - Since 0.002 we shouldn't need to skip test `t/moose_default_undef.t`
   anymore.

0.002	2013-06-16

 [ Packaging ]
 - Support slightly older versions of Class::XSAccessor (back to 1.09).

 [ Other ]
 - Don't use Class::XSAccessor 1.16 and below to generate predicate
   methods, because their behaviour differs observably from Moose. If you
   want XS predicates, you'll need Class::XSAccessor 1.17 (which is not on
   CPAN yet).
   <http://purl.org/NET/cpan-uri/rt/ticket/86127>
 - Refactor overridden install_accessors into an 'after' method modifier,
   with the hope that this makes MooseX::XSAccessor play nicer with other
   MooseX modules.

0.001	2013-06-14	Stable release

0.000_02	2013-06-14
