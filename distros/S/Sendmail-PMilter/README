Sendmail::PMilter
=================

Sendmail::PMilter makes it possible - in fact easy - to write milters
for the Sendmail or Postfix Mail Transfer Agents in pure Perl.

Sendmail::PMilter provides a set of functions which replace those in
the 'libmilter' library supplied with Sendmail, plus some constants
which are needed to support milters which make use of of the Milter
Protocol - especially Version 6 of the Protocol.  Sendmail itself has
supported the Milter Protocol by default since 2004.  It provides the
optional 'libmilter' which is written in C.  For Perl milters this can
be replaced by Sendmail::PMilter.  A milter written in Perl does not
need the 'libmilter' library, and the 'libmilter' provided by Sendmail
need not be built (unless it is needed by other milters).

Sendmail::PMilter supports Milter Protocol Version 6 'negotiation'.

Sendmail::PMilter supports both IPv4 and IPv6.

For installation instructions see the file named INSTALL.  If during
installation the standard procedures are followed, then the tests in
t/ will be run automatically before the final installation step.

As of 2024 this author has been using Sendmail::PMilter routinely to
handle modest volumes of mail for about eight years.  Several people
have also admitted to using it with Postfix, including one with around
500 mail accounts.  It seems to be working well for them.

Enjoy!
