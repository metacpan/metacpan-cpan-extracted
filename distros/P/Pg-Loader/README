Pg-Loader version 0.01
======================

pgloader.pl loads tables to a Postgres database. It is a subset of to
the pgloader(1) python program (written by other authors). Data are
read from the file specified in the configuration file (defaults to
pgloader.dat), and are executed as a single  transaction  via the COPY
command.

The configuration file and command options are almost identical to the
python pythod pgloader(1) and is meant to be a drop-in replacement.
Configuration entries are ignored for unimplemented features.
