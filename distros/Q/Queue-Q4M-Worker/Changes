Revision history for Perl module Queue::Q4M::Worker

0.06 2013-11-15T00:56:45Z
  * Add callbacks 'before_loop_cb' and 'loop_iteration_cb'.
    'before_loop_cb' gets called before the main loop (so is called only
    once per worker process), and 'loop_iteration_cb' is called for every
    iteration of the worker loop.
    Both callbacks may optionally return a guard object. This is useful,
    for example, to apply changes that are only applicable for 1 loop
    iteration, and you want to reset it again on the next iteration
  * Change loop structure so that database handle is fetched for each
    iteration of the loop. This means that if you're providing a callback
    for 'dbh' parameter and you want to keep using the same handle,
    you need to cache it somehow.
  * Delays between loop iterations are randomized. This means that if
    you specify a 1 second delay, the actual amount of sleep time is
    rand(1), not 1.
