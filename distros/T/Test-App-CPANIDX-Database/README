      use Test::App::CPANIDX::Database;
    
      # Create a test database in the current working directory
    
      my $tdb = Test::App::CPANIDX::Database->new();

DESCRIPTION

    Test::App::CPANIDX::Database will generate a test database for use with
    App::CPANIDX deriatives.

    It generates a very simple DBD::SQLite database which contains a single
    CPAN author FOOBAR, a single distribution Foo-Bar-0.01.tar.gz and a
    single module Foo::Bar.

CONSTRUCTOR

    new

      Generates a test database called cpanidx.db and returns an object
      reference.

      Without any parameters this database file will be located in the
      current working directory and will be automatically removed when the
      object falls out of scope.

      You may provide parameters to affect this behaviour.

      unlink

	Set this to a false value to disable the automatic removal of the
	test database file.

          my $tdb = Test::App::CPANIDX::Database->new( unlink => 0 );

      dir

	Set this to an existing directory path where the database file
	should be created.

          my $tdb = Test::App::CPANIDX::Database->new( dir => '/some/funky/path' );

METHODS

    dbfile

      Returns the name of the database file that was generated.
