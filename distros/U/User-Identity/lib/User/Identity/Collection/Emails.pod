=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

=over 4

=item Error: $object is not a collection.

The first argument is an object, but not of a class which extends
L<User::Identity::Collection|User::Identity::Collection>.
Cast by C<addCollection()>

=item Error: Cannot create a $type to add this to my collection.

Some options are specified to create a C<$type> object, which is native to
this collection.  However, for some reason this failed.
Cast by C<addRole()>

=item Error: Cannot load collection module for $type ($class).

Either the specified C<$type> does not exist, or that module named C<$class> returns
compilation errors.  If the type as specified in the warning is not
the name of a package, you specified a nickname which was not defined.
Maybe you forgot the 'require' the package which defines the nickname.
Cast by C<addCollection()>

=item Error: Cannot rename $name into $newname: already exists

Cast by C<renameRole()>

=item Error: Cannot rename $name into $newname: doesn't exist

Cast by C<renameRole()>

=item Error: Creation of a collection via $class failed.

The C<$class> did compile, but it was not possible to create an object
of that class using the options you specified.
Cast by C<addCollection()>

=item Error: Don't know what type of collection you want to add.

If you add a collection, it must either by a collection object or a
list of options which can be used to create a collection object.  In
the latter case, the type of collection must be specified.
Cast by C<addCollection()>

=item Warning: No collection $name

The collection with C<$name> does not exist and can not be created.
Cast by C<add()>

=item Error: Wrong type of role for $collection: requires a $expect but got a $type

Each C<$collection> groups sets of roles of one specific type (C<$expect>).  You
cannot add objects of a different C<$type>.
Cast by C<addRole()>
