NAME

    TestML::Bin - Bin Script for TestML

VERSION

    This document describes TestML::Bin version 0.03.

SYNOPSIS

    Create t/*.t files with a testml shebang line like this:

        #!/usr/bin/env testml
    
        %TestML 0.1.0
    
        *foo == *bar
    
        === Test 1
        --- foo: 123
        --- bar: 123

    Then run prove and it should just work.

    Also this should work:

        testml foo.tml

DESCRIPTION

    This repo provides a bin script from TestML test files that can be used
    in a shebang line. The prove command and possibly other test harness
    runners will honor the shebang and run the test as TestML.

    The script will determine what language and test framework that the
    test expects. In this early realease, only Perl5 is supported but later
    it will honor various ways to set the target language:

      * TESTML_LANG env var

      * --lang=... CLI option

      * .testml config file

      * Repository directory heuristics

    For now just use:

        cpanm TestML::Bin
