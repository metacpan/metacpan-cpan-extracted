Revision history for Apache::Dynagzip

0.16  Sat Oct 09 19:30:00 2004
	- bugfix. Content-Type was overwritten to default text/html during the streaming of a static
	  file because $r->header_out('Content-Type') was not set, however $r->content_type is set
	  properly in PerlLibTreeTrans URI_Translation_Handler. Fixed in two places.
	- documentation was lightly edited, especially regarding the details of module installation
	  and appropriate mod_perl configuration. Thanks to Kevin Austin for the hints.
	- README was reformatted back to plain text.
	- META.yml was created manually and added to MANIFEST.

	- clean up: Dan Kubb has found some inconsistences in implementation of UseCGIHeadersFromScript
	  within the Filter chain. Documentation and the code were cleaned up in order to make sure
	  that UseCGIHeadersFromScript does not affect functionality inside the  Filter chain.

0.11  Mon Jul 21 11:00:00 2003
	- bugfix. It was noticed that Apache::Dynagzip in some cases overwrites the Content-Type set
	  by the earlier filter. Thanks to John Siracusa for the hint. This was fixed to "never
	  overwrite the existent outgoing Content-Type".

	- Rob Bloodgood and Damyan Ivanov complained about "uninitialized value" warnings from unused
	  HTTP headers, and about pack mode "c", which generated warnings on their systems (running -w).
	  I failed to reproduce the effect of pack mode, but decided to change the mode to "C"
	  because it has been reported as a clean solution for both Rob and Damyan from one side,
	  and this should not effect the packed code (as I understand it) from the other side.
	  "Uninitialized value" warnings were blocked in accordance with the patch provided by Rob Bloodgood.
	  All changes were manually double-checked with the patch provided by Damyan Ivanov.
	- partial code revision has been done in order to prepare the further structural changes.

	- fundamental revision of the code to avoid possible copyright questions from Outlook Technologies, Inc.
	  My own decision to publish the code on CPAN could never be considered an any kind of competition with OLT
	  business, since my layoff clearly demonstrates the fact, that OLT has no business interests
	  in this market of products and services, and does not plan to work on this market in future.
	- documentation is edited appropriately.
