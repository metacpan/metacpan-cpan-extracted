Mail::SpamAssassin::SpamCopURI
===========
This module must now only be installed with SA 2.63 or 2.64.  
A check is done in the Makefile.PL to ensure the correct version.
Changes were made to core classes and these are distributed with 
this package to ease installation.  

For completeness I have included a complete diff between the
SA sources and the modifications included in the file diff-2.63.

Upgrading from versions prior to 0.11
=====================================
If you are installing over a version prior to 0.11, you should
remove spamcopuri-update from your cron (if you set this up)
as well as delete it from your bin directory.  This script
is no longer needed.

You can also remove the 'spamcop_uri' from your .spamassassin 
directory typically found under your home directory.

Quick Install
===========
perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install

cp rules/spamcop_uri.cf /etc/mail/spamassassin

You may need to restart your spamd to pick up the new rules change,
if you run the daemon process.

You may see some output like this when running perl Makefile.PL:

  # SAPATH /usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.8.3
  # installsitelib /usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.8.3
  # INSTALLDIRS site

This is safe to ignore and is only printed out to aid with potential
installation problems.

Upgrading 2.63 to 2.64 with SpamCopURI
=============

If you are upgrading from SA 2.63 to 2.64 and have SpamCopURI installed, 
you will most likely need to remove /etc/mail/spamassassin/spamcop_uri.cf 
for all the SA tests to complete successfully.

Painful Install
=============
If you don't see the rules being hit, then you most likely have some
issue with @INC.  Do a search for PerMsgStatus.pm, Conf.pm and SpamCopURI.pm.

You need to copy PerMsgStatus.pm and Conf.pm over the files that SpamAssassin
originally installed.  
You can find this out by typing:

perl -MMail::SpamAssassin::PerMsgStatus -e 'print $INC{"Mail/SpamAssassin/PerMsgStatus.pm"},"\n"'

which will print out something like:

/usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.8.3/Mail/SpamAssassin/PerMsgStatus.pm

In this case you just need to copy from this package
  lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/PerMsgStatus.pm 
  lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/Conf.pm 
  lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/SpamCopURI.pm

  to /usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.8.3/Mail/SpamAssassin

After placing the rules in a proper place, you should be all set.
