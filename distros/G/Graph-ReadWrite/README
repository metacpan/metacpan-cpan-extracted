			Graph-ReadWrite

This is a collection of perl classes for reading and writing
directed graphs in a variety of file formats. The graphs are
represented in Perl using Jarkko Hietaniemi's Graph classes.
Version 2+ of this distribution works with version 0.5 and
later of the Graph distribution.

There are two base classes:

	Graph::Reader
	Base class for classes which read a graph
	file and create an instance of the Graph class.

	Graph::Writer
	Base class for classes which take an instance of the
	Graph class and write it out in a specific file format.

This distribution also defines a simple XML format for storing
directed graphs, defined to meet the needs of the Graph class.
A reader and writer are provided for this:

	Graph::Reader::XML
	Graph::Writer::XML

Writers are also included for Dot, VCG, and daVinci,
two packages for displaying / rendering graphs.
Dot and VCG are freely available; daVinci is freely available
at the moment, but that is going to change soon.

	Graph::Writer::Dot
	Graph::Writer::VCG
	Graph::Writer::daVinci

A reader for Dot files has been contributed by Mark Hillebrand:

	Graph::Reader::Dot

A reader and writer for HTK lattices are also included:

	Graph::Reader::HTK
	Graph::Writer::HTK

These last two will probably only be of interest to people working
with HTK, or tools which use the same format.

Dependencies:
	Graph		Jarkko's Graph classes
	XML::Parser	used by Graph::Reader::XML
	XML::Writer	used by Graph::Writer::XML
	IO::File

To install these modules, you should just have to run the following:

	% perl Makefile.PL
	% make
	% make test
	% make install

This distribution contains an early version of a test-suite;
you may get a warning about an undefined value from one of the tests.

Bugs, suggestions, and new readers and writers will be gratefully received.
