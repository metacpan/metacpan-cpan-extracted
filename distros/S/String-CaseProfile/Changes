Revision history for String::CaseProfile

0.18  February 9, 2010

    * Reorganized a bit the new doc samples and fixed a layout issue.

0.17  February 9, 2010

    * Added Test::Warn to the PREREQ_PM section in Makefile.PL.
    * Changed the encoding of CaseProfile.pm, 03_caseprofile.t, and
      04_caseprofile_options.t to UTF-8.
    * Updated the documentation adding samples using the Armenian, Cyrillic and
      Greek alphabets. Also added the corresponding test file.
    
0.16  February 7, 2010

    * Changed slightly the interface of the get_profile function to add
      a new option, strict, which can be used to consider words of unknown type
      (ignored by default) when determining the string type.
      The old interface still works.
    * Improved the word regex to detect things like AT&T as "single-words".
    * Changed the scope of $word_re and %types from package variables to
      global variables.
    * Updated the documentation.
    * Renamed 04_caseprofile_exclude.t --> 04_caseprofile_options.t and added
      more tests.
    * Used Test::Warn to capture warnings during test run.
    * Changed the contact e-mail address.
    * Added the BUGS and SUPPORT boilerplate sections.
    * Updated the license text.

0.15  February 27, 2009

    * Modified the word detection regular expression to cover some types of
      acronyms.
    * Added more tests.

0.14  January 10, 2009

    * Added the 'report' key to the profile hash returned by get_profile,
      so the user can print a summary of the string profile to get the picture
      at a glance.
    * Updated the documentation.

0.13  December 24, 2008

    * Fixed a bug in get_profile to cover the case where the source string
      only contains a single-letter word.

    * Minor doc changes.

0.12  November 1, 2008

    * Fixed a bug in a doc sample.

0.11  November 1, 2008

    * Changed the name of the new 'string' key (introduced in version 0.10)
      of the profile hash to 'fold', for clarity.

0.10  November 1, 2008

    * Added a 'string' key to the profile hash returned by get_profile.
      Its value is a pattern string that can be used to process 'other' profiles.
    * Updated the documentation.

0.09  June 20, 2008

    * Removed a debug statement left in update 0.07

0.08  June 18, 2008

    * Improved the documentation

0.07  June 17, 2008

    * Added functionality that allows the user to specify (input) words that
      should not be considered when determining the profile of a string using
      the get_profile function, to specify (output) words that should not
      be affected by the set_profile function, and to specify both kinds of
      excluded words in the copy_profile function
    * Added more tests to cover this functionality
    * Cleaned up the code
    * Updated the documentation

0.06  June 4, 2008

    * Moved the $word_re compiled regex definition to the top-level (to avoid
      compiling it every time the get_profile function is called), declaring
      it as a global package variable
    * Turned the %types global lexical variable into a global package variable

0.05  February 3, 2008

    * Added the copy_profile convenience function
    * Updated the documentation

0.04  January 29, 2008

    * Removed the consonants_rx compilation, since this regex is used only once
      in every call to _word_type
    * Improved the synopsis and made minor changes to other sections of the
      documentation
