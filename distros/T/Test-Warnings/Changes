Revision history for Test-Warnings

0.031     2021-07-13 22:13:48Z
          - remove unneeded develop prereqs that caused metacpan to unduly
            raise the river position of some dependent modules

0.030     2020-03-21 16:56:30Z
          - fix tests that can fail when there is already an installed module
            named Foo::Bar::Baz (RT#132140)

0.029     2020-03-14 05:27:59Z
          - new :report_warnings feature, for printing all of the (unexpected)
            warning content when had_no_warnings() is called (Tina Mueller, PR#10)

0.028     2019-12-21 20:16:01Z
          - allow for calling warnings->import being called after importing
            the "warnings" sub

0.027     2019-09-28 03:54:47Z
          - new :fail_on_warning feature, for more easily seeing where the
            surprising warning appeared during testing

0.026     2016-01-27 03:13:25Z
          - fixed use of modules loaded by t/zzz-check-breaks.t
          - fix stderr suppression on perl 5.6

0.025     2016-01-24 02:59:28Z
          - prereqs lowered from required to suggested:
            - CPAN::Meta::Check
            - CPAN::Meta::Requirements
          - tests are now quieter to avoid causing confusion, by suppressing
            the printing of stderr in tests

0.024     2015-12-24 18:44:29Z
          - remove diagnostics accidentally left in new test

0.023     2015-12-22 06:44:24Z
          - properly handle propagating warnings to previously declared
            handlers that are not coderefs (i.e. a sub name, or the magic
            DEFAULT and IGNORE)

0.022     2015-12-19 00:32:42Z
          - propagate all warnings to any previously-declared __WARN__
            handlers (unlike with __DIE__, merely calling warn() is not
            sufficient)

0.021     2015-03-21 18:48:27Z
          - add a x_breaks entry for conflicting versions of File::pushd which
            inadvertently call our exported warnings() rather than invoking
            warnings.pm, and documented this undesired interaction

0.020     2015-01-03 20:32:21Z
          - re-release to fix problematic $VERSION declaration (RT#101239)

0.019     2014-12-18 20:07:02Z
          - fix test to allow for special characters (e.g. MSWin32 file
            separators) in filenames (A. Sinan Unur, PR#7)

0.018     2014-12-17 18:17:30Z
          - fix test to not depend on message formatting changes in newer Carp

0.017     2014-12-16 20:17:22Z
          - handle other warning handlers passing us partial warning messages
            by re-adding the source file and line number

0.016     2014-06-21 04:04:55Z
          - fix prereq problem with last release - now no longer testing the
            example scripts for user installs

0.015     2014-06-20 03:36:33Z
          - adjusted packaging and tests to become perl-5.6 friendly,
            including only using core or dual-lifed prerequisites

0.014     2014-03-01 22:08:26Z
          - fix test that was failing when FOO or BAR environment variables
            were set (RT#93447)

0.013     2013-12-14 21:26:06Z
          - update configure_requires checking in Makefile.PL

0.012     2013-10-14 16:54:47Z
          - re-release to fix t/00-report-prereqs.t use of
            CPAN::Meta::Requirements

0.011     2013-10-12 22:15:02Z
          - unnecessary tests removed; CONTRIBUTING file added

0.010     2013-09-25 03:29:53Z
          - re-release with fixed compile test

0.009     2013-09-11 04:49:55Z
          - fixed error in synopsis (we do not export anything by default)
          - a caveat added to the documentation regarding embedding warning
            checks inside another sub (this is for you, ribasushi!!!)
          - ':no_end_test' now also covers side effects of done_testing, as
            well as END blocks, making it possible to use the warning(s) subs
            without having an end warning test while using done_testing
            (necessary when combining with the 'if' pragma)

0.008     2013-07-14 19:02:01Z
          - compile test updated, to hopefully fix mswin32 parsing issues

0.007     2013-07-09 22:10:36Z
          - fix subtest tests to work on Test::More before 0.95_01
            (RT#86802)

0.006     2013-06-21 00:53:54Z
          - remove use of Class::Method::Modifiers

0.005     2013-06-20 19:18:42Z
          - new feature: warnings { code } and warning { code }, for capturing
            the contents of warnings for subsequent testing

0.004     2013-05-21 21:58:55Z
          - when allowing warnings (via allow_warnings()), messages are
            emitted via note() rather than warn(), for less noisy output when
            running in a harness

0.003     2013-04-13 21:07:58Z
          - Test suite (and code) fixed to work in the presence of
            Test::Builder 1.005+ (TB2)
          - END logic fixed: now a no-warnings test is added whenever any
            tests have been run, even if there is no plan, as was originally
            intended

0.002     2013-03-14 21:47:30Z
          Releasing as non-TRIAL for greater visibility.
          - ':no_end_test' option added
          - test added showing that we play nicely with 'skip_all'

0.001     2013-03-10 00:56:29Z (TRIAL RELEASE)
          - Initial release.
