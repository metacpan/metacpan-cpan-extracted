=head1 NAME

github_creator - Create a Github repository from your local repository

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	# edit ~/.github_creator.ini

	# Inside a git repo
	% github_creator --name my-project --desc "an awesome thing"

	# for a Perl distro, figure it out through META.yml
	% github_creator
	
=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a short script you can run from within an existing git
repository to create a remote repo on Github using a previously
created account. This does not create Github accounts (and that
violates the terms of service).

If the C<--name> and C<--desc> switches are not given, it will try
to find them in META.yml. If the script doesn't find a META.yml, it
tries to run `make metafile` (or `Build distmeta`) to create one.

From META.yml it gets the module name and abstract, which it uses for
the Github project name and description. It uses the CPAN Search page
as the homepage (e.g. http://search.cpan.org/dist/Foo-Bar).

Once it creates the remote repo, it adds a git remote named "origin"
(unless you change that in the config), then pushes master to it.

If Github sends back the right page, the script ends by printing the
private git URL.

=head1 CONFIGURATION

The configuration file is an INI file named F<.github_creator.ini>
which the script looks for in the current directory or your home
directory (using the first one it finds).

Example:

	[github]
	login_page="https://github.com/login"
	account=joe@example.com
	password=foobar
	remote_name=github
	debug=1

=head2 Section [github]

=over 4

  
=item login_page (default = https://github.com/login)

This shouldn't change, but what the hell. It's the only URL
you need to know.

=item account (default = GITHUB_USER environment var)

Your account name, which is probably your email address.

=item password (default = GITHUB_PASS environment var)

=item remote_name (default = origin)

I like to use "github" though.

=item debug (default = 0)

Do everything but don't actually create the Githun repo.

=head1 ISSUES

The Github webserver seems to not return the right page every so
often, so things might go wrong. Try again a couple times.

Sometimes there is a delay in the availability of your new repo. This
script sleeps a couple of seconds then tries to verify that the new repo
is there. If it can't see it, look at Github first to see if it showed up.
