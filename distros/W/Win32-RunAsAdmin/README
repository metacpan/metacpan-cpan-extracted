Win32::RunAsAdmin

The Windows Vista/7/8 UAC system (User Account Control) is poorly designed for a scripting
language. Win32::RunAsAdmin provides a simple way to request elevation right at the start
of the script, like this:

   use Win32::RunAsAdmin qw(force);

Put that at the beginning of your script, and the "Do you want to let this program make
changes to your system" box will pop up, after which your script will restart in a new
console with elevated privileges. Simple as that.

Install using the usual CPAN tools.
