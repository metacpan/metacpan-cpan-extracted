NAME
    Unicode::Util - Unicode grapheme-level versions of core Perl functions

VERSION
    This document describes Unicode::Util v0.10.

SYNOPSIS
        use Unicode::Util qw( grapheme_length grapheme_reverse );

        # grapheme cluster ю́ (Cyrillic small letter yu, combining acute accent)
        my $grapheme = "ю\x{301}";

        say length($grapheme);           # 2 (length in code points)
        say grapheme_length($grapheme);  # 1 (length in grapheme clusters)

        # Spın̈al Tap; n̈ = Latin small letter n, combining diaeresis
        my $band = "Spın\x{308}al Tap";

        say scalar reverse $band;     # paT länıpS
        say grapheme_reverse($band);  # paT lan̈ıpS

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides versions of core Perl string functions tailored to
    work on Unicode grapheme clusters, which are what users perceive as
    characters, as opposed to code points, which are what Perl considers
    characters.

FUNCTIONS
    These functions all operate on character strings, not byte strings. They
    are implemented using the "\X" character class, which was introduced in
    Perl v5.6 and significantly improved in v5.12 to properly match Unicode
    extended grapheme clusters. An example of a notable change is that CR+LF
    <0x0D 0x0A> is now considered a single grapheme cluster instead of two.
    For that reason, as well as additional Unicode improvements, Perl v5.12
    or greater is strongly recommended, both for use with this module and as
    a language in general.

    These functions may each be exported explicitly or by using the ":all"
    tag for everything.

    grapheme_length($string)
    grapheme_length
        Works like "length" except the length is in number of grapheme
        clusters.

    grapheme_chop($string)
    grapheme_chop(@array)
    grapheme_chop(%hash)
    grapheme_chop
        Works like "chop" except it operates on the last grapheme cluster.

    grapheme_reverse($string)
    grapheme_reverse(@list)
    grapheme_reverse
        Works like "reverse" except it reverses grapheme clusters in scalar
        context.

    grapheme_index($string, $substring, $position)
    grapheme_index($string, $substring)
        Works like "index" except the position is in grapheme clusters.

    grapheme_rindex($string, $substring, $position)
    grapheme_rindex($string, $substring)
        Works like "rindex" except the position is in grapheme clusters.

    grapheme_substr($string, $offset, $length, $replacement)
    grapheme_substr($string, $offset, $length)
    grapheme_substr($string, $offset)
        Works like "substr" except the offset and length are in grapheme
        clusters.
