Revision history for App-RoboBot

4.004     2017-03-19
  - Added karma-losers to social.karma module.
  - Fix bot.logging to properly log outgoing messages even for non-channel
    messages or when channel logging is disabled (a slight misnomer here, since
    channel logging refers to whether chat history is available to members of
    the channel, as opposed to whether Log4Perl facilities receive the events).
  - Fix a couple missing dependencies by manually listing them in dist.ini.
  - Modified (help <function>) use to use RoboBot::Doc instead of plugin
    metadata to pave way for more consistent and easily maintained docs.
  - Added clear-skills function to social.skills module.
  - Added bot.irc module with irc-kick and irc-mode functions.
  - Removed api.taskman module.
