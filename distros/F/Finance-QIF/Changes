Revision history for Perl extension Finance::QIF.

3.02  Wed Sep 29 21:04:00 PDT 2010
        - Fixed bugs with write support for splits with partial data.

3.01  Thu Apr 08 12:30:00 EDT 2010
	- Corrected documentation for Account and Type:Memorized
        - Updated code separators based on perlport "NEWLINES" recommendation
	- Use binmode in more compatible manner (older IO::File missing method)

3.00  Thu Jul 24 12:17:00 2008
	- Added support for Quicken 2006 new Memorized Investment fields
	- Added support for Quicken 2006 Price format
	- The changes for the Memorized investment created a conflict with
          naming to get things consistent and to hopefully avoid future
          issues some value names have changed. This is the reason for a 3.00.
          Old code may require modification this map will help in porting
	  Old Name                   New Name
	  noninvestment:amount       noninvestment:transaction
	  memorized:transaction      memorized:type
	  memorized:amount           memorized:transaction

          update.

        - Fixed tests so new test using "<:crlf" format is only done for
