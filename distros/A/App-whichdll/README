NAME

    whichdll - Find dynamic libraries in the appropriate path

VERSION

    version 0.03

SYNOPSIS

     $ whichdll xml2
     $ whichdll -a xml2  # print all matches
     $ whichdll -a \*    # print all DLLs
     $ whichdll -s xml2  # silent mode

DESCRIPTION

    whichdll is a command line interface to FFI::CheckLib. It can be
    helpful in determining the location of dynamic libraries installed on
    your system. Its primary purpose is to be used in debugging issues
    related to FFI::CheckLib, or FFI::Platypus. The command takes one or
    more arguments, which are treated as library names. The whichdll script
    will find the platform specific names in the appropriate places if they
    can be found in the system path. Thus when you search for foo you will
    get a result like libfoo.so.1.2.3 on Linux, foo.dll on Windows,
    libfoo.dylib or foo.bundle on OS X, cygfoo-1.0.dll on Cygwin, etc.,
    with the appropriate full path.

    By default duplicates due to duplicate paths or symlinks will be
    removed. You can see them using the -x option. For example on Debian:

     $ ./bin/whichdll -a xml2
     /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libxml2.so.2.9.4
     $ ./bin/whichdll -a -x xml2
     /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libxml2.so.2.9.4
     /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libxml2.so => /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libxml2.so.2.9.4
     /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libxml2.so.2 => /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libxml2.so.2.9.4

    You can use the wildcard * to print all libraries. This implies the -a
    option.

OPTIONS

 -a

    Print all matches instead of just the first one.

 -s

    No output, just return 0 if any of the DLLs are found, or 1 if none are
    found.

 -v

    Prints version and copyright notice and exits.

 -x

    Do not prune duplicates.
