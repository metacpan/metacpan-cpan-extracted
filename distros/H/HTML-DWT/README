DESCRIPTION
    A perl module designed to parse a simple HTML template file generated by
    Macromedia Dreamweaver and replace fields in the template with values
    from a CGI script.

METHODS
  Options

      use HTML::DWT qw(:Template);

    Using the Template option allows for built in support in HTML::DWT for
    the HTML::Template invocation syntax (param(), output() etc.) See
    HTML::Template for more details. It is best to require a version of 2.05
    for HTML::DWT to support this option.

  new()

      new HTML::DWT("file.dwt");

      new HTML::DWT(
                    filename => "file.dwt",
                    associate => $q,
                    case_sensitive => 1,
                    no_includes => 1,
                    path => '/var/www/html',
                    xml => $xml-data,
                    );

    Creates and returns a new HTML::DWT object based on the Dreamweaver
    template 'file.dwt' (can specify a relative or absolute path). The
    Second instance is recommended, although the first style is still
    supported for backwards compatability with versions before 2.05.

    associate: The associate option allows the template to inherit parameter
    values from other objects. The object associated with the template must
    have a param() method which works like HTML::DWT's param(). Both CGI and
    HTML::Template fit this profile. To associate another object, create it
    and pass the reference scalar to HTML::DWT's new() method under the
    associate option (see above).

    case_sensitive: The case_sensitive option allows HTML::DWT to treat
    template fields in a case-sensitive manner. HTML::DWT's default behavior
    is to match all fields in a case-insensitive manner (i.e. doctitle is
    considered the same as DOCTITLE or DocTitle). Set case_sensitive to 1 to
    over- ride this default behavior.

    no_includes: HTML::DWT will by default look for any included Dreamweaver
    library item files (.lbi files) that may be specified in the template
    using the <!-- #BeginLibraryItem "file.lbi" -> field. The module will
    open the specified library file and will include the file's contents in
    the generated HTML. Setting no_includes to 1 will over-ride this default
    behavior.

    path: HTML::DWT will accept an array of paths under which it will look
    for template and library files. The module will also look in directories
    specified by the environment variables $HTML_TEMPLATE_ROOT and
    $DOCUMENT_ROOT. Absolute path names are not checked, although the
    pseudo-paths '/Library/' and '/Templates/' are treated as relative
    paths.

    xml: HTML::DWT will accept a string value containing an XML document
    that conforms to the HTML-DWT DTD. This string may be associated with
    the template object through the XML option in the constructor. Each
    <item> tag in the XML document will have its contents loaded into a
    corresponding template field. A valid HTML-DWT XML document will look
    like this:

      <?xml version="1.0"?>
      <templateItems template="/Templates/temp.dwt">
        <item name="centercont"><![CDATA[Testing]]></item>
        <item name="doctitle"><![CDATA[<title>testing</title>]]></item>
        <item name="leftcont"><![CDATA[Testing]]></item>
        <item name="rightcont"><![CDATA[Testing]]></item>
      </templateItems>

    These documents can be automaticly generated both by HTML::DWT based on
    template data using export(), or by Macromedia Dreamweaver.

  fill()

      $template->fill(\%dataHash);

      $template->fillTemplate(\%dataHash);

    Takes a hash reference where the keys are the named areas of the
    template and the associated values are HTML content for those areas.
    This method returns a complete HTML document, which can then be sent to
    STDOUT (the browser). The fill() method is the prefered means of
    accessing this functionality; fillTemplate() is implemented only to
    support versions of HTML::DWT earlier than version 2.05.

  param()

      $template->param();

      $template->param('doctitle');

      $template->param(
                      doctitle => '<title>DWT Generated</title>',
                      leftcont => 'Some HTML content here'
                      );

    Takes a hash of one or more key/value pairs, where each key is a named
    area of the template, and the associated value is the HTML content for
    that area. This method returns void (HTML substitiutions are stored
    within the object awaiting output()).

    If called with a single paramter--this parameter must be a valid field
    name--param() returns the value currently set for the field, or undef if
    no value has been set.

    If called with no parameters, param() returns a list of all field names.

    NOTE: All Dreamweaver templates store the HTML page's title in a field
    named 'doctitle'. HTML::DWT will accept a raw title (without <title>
    tags) and will add the appropriate tags if the content of the 'doctitle'
    field should require them.

    This is a HTML::Template compatible method.

  clear_params()

      $template->clear_params();

    Clears all field values from the template's parameter list and sets each
    parameter to an undefined value.

    This is a HTML::Template compatible method.

  output()

      $template->output();
  
      $template->output(print_to => \*STDOUT);

    Returns the parsed template and its substituted HTML for output. The
    template must be filled using either fill() or param() before calling
    output().

    print_to: Alternativly, by passing a filehandle reference to output()'s
    print_to option you may output the template content directly to that
    filehandle. In this case output() returns an undefined value.

    This is a HTML::Template compatible method.

  export()

      $template->export(
                        type  => 'dw',
                        output => 'file',
                        filename => 'dwt.xml',
                        print_to => \*STDOUT
                        );

    This method exports the filled template data to an XML file format.

    type: Dreamweaver supports two XML styles for templates, the Dreamweaver
    style, and another standardized style using editable region name tags.
    'dw', the type flag for the Dreamweaver style is the default setting for
    export(), although you may change that by using the type option and
    passing it either 'dw' or 'er'.

    output: If no output style is indicated, export() will return the XML
    document. Output may be sent to a file, in which case the output option
    is passed the value 'file', or output may be sent to an open filehandle,
    in which case output is passed a 'FH' value.

    filename: If sending output to a file, the filename option musst be
    included with a valid filename (absolute or relative paths are
    acceptable). Export will return the filename, or undefined on an error.
    Error messages are stored in $HTML::DWT::errmsg.

    print_to: If sending output to a filehandle instead of using the
    filename option, pass a reference to a filehandle to the print_to
    option. For convienience of use with CGI scripts, export() will include
    a 'Content-type: text/xml' header before the XML document when
    outputting to a filehandle. When sending output to a filehandle export()
    returns undefined.

  query()

      $template->query();

      $template->query('doctitle');

      $template->query(name => 'doctitle');

    Returns the 'type' of the template field specified. For all HTML::DWT
    fields the type is 'VAR' (HTML::DWT doesn't support HTML::Template's
    idea of LOOPs or IFs). If called with no parameters, query() returns a
    list of all field names.

    This is a HTML::Template compatible method.

DIAGNOSTICS
    Template File $file not opened:
        (F) The template file was not opened properly. This message is
        stored in $HTML::DWT::errmsg
