Somehow we should think very carefully about how to back the WWW::Link
class with a database.

As one option we should split up the link into different records in an
SQL database.  There would be tables like

Links
	id
	url
	status
	reliability
	<etc> - possibly a perl object as a string?

Tests
	id
	LINK-ID
	date
	response

pages-to-links
	page-url
	LINK-ID
	description
	
Infostrucs
	url-base
	dir-base
	


test that the link makes reasonable suggestions for when it should be
checked (e.g. within the next month and no later etc.)

test for redirects of finite length

test for indefinite redirects

test for non redirects
