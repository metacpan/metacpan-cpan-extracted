This is a list of Todo items. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------

- Be able to obtain a widget's text.  For example, if we could
  obtain the label text of a button, we could then locate its
  position and use ClickWindow to click on it rather then using
  ClickWindow with pre-known offsets or even SendKeys.  I've
  looked at such things as XtWindowToWidget, XFetchName,
  XtGetValues.  The EditRes protocol is not generic enough and
  requires the support of the client application.  Could look
  at spying on the X server to find this information or use AT-SPI.

- Ensure alternatively mapped mouse buttons are handled
  appropriately.
