=head1 Name 

Text::SenseClusters::LabelEvaluation::Driver - Module for evaluation of labels of the clusters. 

=head1 SYNOPSIS


	The following code snippet will evaluate the labels by comparing
	them with text data for a gold-standard key from Wikipedia.
	
	In order to test this module, please copy 'TestData' folder in current directory
	or adjust directory location while mentioning the label and GoldKeys files. 

	# Including the LabelEvaluation Module.
	use Text::SenseClusters::LabelEvaluation::Driver;
	
	my $labelFileName  = 'TestData/TVS/TVS.label';
	my $topicFileName	= 'TestData/TVS/TVSTopic.txt';
	
	# Calling the LabelEvaluation modules by passing the following options
	%inputOptions = (
			senseClusterLabelFileName => $labelFileName, 
			labelComparisonMethod => 'automate',
			goldKeyFileName => $topicFileName,
			goldKeyDataSource => 'wikipedia',
			weightRatio => 10,
			isClean => 1,
	);
	
	
	# Calling the LabelEvaluation modules by passing the name of the 
	# label and topic files.
	my $driverObject = Text::SenseClusters::LabelEvaluation::Driver->
			new (\%inputOptions);
		
	if($driverObject->{"errorCode"}){
		print "Please correct the error before proceeding.\n\n";
		exit();
	}
	my $accuracyScore = $driverObject->evaluateLabels();

	# Printing the score.			
	print "\n\nScore of label evaluation is :: $accuracyScore \n";

=head1 DESCRIPTION

	This Program will compare the result obtained from the SenseClusters with that 
	of Gold Standards. Gold Standards can be obtained from:
			1. Wikipedia
			2. Wordnet
			3. User Provided
			
	For fetching the Wikipedia data it use the WWW::Wikipedia module from the CPAN 
	and for comparison of Labels with Gold Standards it uses the Text::Similarity
	Module. The comparison result is then further processed to obtain the result
	and score of result.



	
=head1 FILE FORMATS:

=head2 senseClusterLabelFileName:
	
	This tells about the file that will contains the labels for the clusters generated by SenseClusters. 
	The file format for this file should be same as that of generated  by SenseClusters.
	
	For e.g:
	
	Cluster 0 (Descriptive): George Bush, Russian President, British Prime, British Minister, India Pakistan, US George, Prime Minister, 
	Cluster 0 (Discriminating): Russian President, British Minister, India Pakistan, US George, 
	Cluster 1 (Descriptive): George Bush, British Prime, weapons mass, United Nations, September 11, mass destruction, United States, 
				Prime Minister, military action
	Cluster 1 (Discriminating): United Nations, September 11, United States
	Cluster 2 (Descriptive): George Bush, weapons destruction, prime minister, axis evil, Saddam Hussein, weapons mass, mass destruction, 
				Gulf War, military action, Iraqi leader
	Cluster 2 (Discriminating): weapons destruction, prime minister, axis evil, Saddam Hussein, Gulf War, Iraqi leader
		

=head2 goldKeyFileName:

	This parameter contains the name of the file that contains the gold standard keys for the labels of clusters generated by
	SenseClusters.
		
	The file format provided by user for Gold-Standard key's are dependent on the following
	two parameters that user pass to call this module:
	
=head3 labelComparisonMethod
	
	This parameter tells that whether is passing the mapping information between
	goldkeys and clusters or not.
	
	Two options available are:	1. 'direct'		- this says user will provide the mapping info.
								 	2. 'automate' 		- this says module should find the best possible 
								 	                    mapping between cluster's label and goldkeys.	
			 
=head3 goldKeyDataSource  
		
	  		This parameter tell this module from where it can read more information about
	  		the goldkeys
	  		
			Options for this parameter are:		1. 'wikipedia'		- this tells to fetch data from wikipedia.
									 				2. 'wordnet'		- this tells to fetch data from wordnet.
									 				3. 'userData'		- this tells user will give the data along 
									 				                    with mapping.
									 				
		
	
	Combinatios of the various values for the aboue two parameters will give the following six cases:	

		(Please note that separator between cluster name and Goldkeys are ":::".
		Also, the separator between Goldkeys and their data are ":::")  
		
=head4	Case 1.		labelComparisonMethod => 'direct', 			goldKeyDataSource => 'userData' 
		

		a) In this case user should provide the mapping between the clusters and Goldkeys
		b) User should also provide the data about these goldstandard keys.
		
				for e.g: 
						
				Cluster0:::Tony Blair  
				Cluster1:::Vladimir Putin 
				Cluster2:::Saddam Hussein

				Tony Blair::: Anthony Charles Lynton Blair (born 6 May 1953)[1] is a British Labour Party politician who served 
				as the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1997 to 2007. He was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Sedgefield 
				from 1983 to 2007 and Leader of the Labour Party from 1994 to 2007. He resigned from all of these positions in 
				June 2007.

				revolutionary Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party.

=head4	Case 2.		labelComparisonMethod => 'direct', 			goldKeyDataSource => 'wikipedia'
		
		a) In this case user just need to provide the mapping between the clusters and Goldkeys.
		b) User do not need to provide the data about these goldstandard keys. Even though, if user provides the
		   data about these topics, it will be ignored.

=head1 RESULT


=head4  a) Contingency Matrix:	
	         Based on the similarity comparison of Labels with the gold standards,
	         the Contingency Matrix is generated. Following shows an example of 
	         contingency matrix for the example mentioned in synposis:


		Original Contingency Matrix: 
		 
			   		Bill Clinton		Tony Blair  
		-------------------------------------------------
		 Cluster0			54				48
		-------------------------------------------------
		 Cluster1			31				16
		------------------------------------------------- 
	
=head4	b) Using Hungarian algorithm to display the new contingency matrix,
		whose diagonal elements indicates the assigned similarity-score
		between a cluster and a gold-standard key. This format of matrix
		has the maximum possible diagonal's total.   
	
		Example:
		
		Contigency Matrix after Hungarian Algorithm: 
		 
			   			Tony Blair 	Bill Clinton  
		-------------------------------------------------
		 Cluster0			48				54
		-------------------------------------------------
		 Cluster1			16				31
		-------------------------------------------------
	

=head4	c) Conclusion: Displays the conclusion of the Hungarian algorithm:
			
			Example:
			
			Final Conclusion using Hungarian Algorithm::
				Cluster0	<-->	Tony  Blair 
				Cluster1	<-->	Bill Clinton  
	
	
=head4	d) Displaying the overall accuracy for the label assignment:
		
		 							Sum (Diagonal Scores)
	  		Accuracy =	 -------------------------------------------
	 						Sum (All the Scores of contingency table)
	 		
	 		Example:				
			Accuracy of labels is 53.02%

Name of the file containing the labels from SenseClusters. The syntax of file 
must be similar to label file from SenseClusters. This is mandatory parameter.
	
=head2 labelComparisonMethod: 

Name of the method for comparing the labels with GoldKey. This method tells 
the program whether the keyFile provided by the User will have the mapping 
between the assigned labels and expected topics of the clusters. 

	Possible options are : 
		A) 'DirectAssignment' and 
		B) 'AutomateAssignment'.
