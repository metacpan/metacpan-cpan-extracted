HISTORY
    0.99    Original version; taken from Log::Dispatch::File::Rolling 1.02

    1.00    Initial coding

    1.01    Updated packaging for newer standards. No changes to the coding.

    1.02    Added unlocking of files we do not use.

            Removed the 9999 files limit. Now it will create as many files
            as a Perl integer can support.

    1.03    Adapted to changes in Log::Dispatch::File. If you are using
            Log::Dispatch::File 2.36 or earlier, use Alerts 1.02.

    1.04    Dependency change of 1.03 was missing from the Makefile.PL.
            Oops.
