DESCRIPTION
    This module models the hydrolitic behaviour of a proteolytic enzyme. Its
    main purpose is to predict the outcome of hydrolitic cleavage of a
    peptidic substrate.

    The enzyme specificity is currently modeled for 37 enzymes/reagents.
    This models are somewhat simplistic as they are largely regex-based, and
    do not take into account subtleties such as kinetic/temperature effects,
    accessible solvent area, secondary or tertiary structure elements.
    However, the module is flexible enough to allow the inclusion of any of
    these effects by consuming the module's interface, Bio::ProteaseI.
    Alternatively, if your desired specificity can be correctly described by
    a regular expression, you can pass it to the specificity attribute at
    construction time. See specificity below.

ATTRIBUTES
  specificity
    Set the enzyme's specificity. Required. Could be either of:

    *   an enzyme name: e.g. 'enterokinase'

            my $enzyme = Bio::Protease->new(specificity => 'enterokinase');

        There are currently definitions for 37 enzymes/reagents. See
        Specificities.

    *   a regular expression:

            my $motif = qr/MN[ED]K[^P].{3}/,

            my $enzyme = Bio::Protease->new( specificity => $motif );

        The motif should always describe an 8-character long peptide. When a
        an octapeptide matches the regex, its 4th peptidic bond (ie, between
        the 4th and 5th letter) will be marked for cleaving or reporting.

        For example, the peptide AMQRNLAW is recognized as follows:

            .----..----.----..----. .-----.-----.-----.-----.
            | A  || M  | Q  || R  |*|  N  |  L  |  A  |  W  |
            |----||----|----||----|^|-----|-----|-----|-----|
            | P4 || P3 | P2 || P1 ||| P1' | P2' | P3' | P4' |
            '----''----'----''----'|'-----'-----'-----'-----'
                              cleavage site

        Some specificity rules can only be described with more than one
        regular expression (see the case for trypsin, for example). To
        account for those cases, you can also pass an array reference of
        regular expressions; all of which should match the given
        octapeptide:

            my $rule = [$rule1, $rule2, $rule3];

            my $enzyme = Bio::Protease->new( specificity => $rule );

        In the case your particular specificity rule requires an "or"
        clause, you can use the "|" separator in a single regex.

  Specificities
    This class attribute contains a hash reference with all the available
    regexep-based specificities. The keys are the specificity names, the
    value is an arrayref with the regular expressions that define them.

        my @protease_pool = do {
            Bio::Protease->new(specificity => $_)
                for keys %{Bio::Protease->Specificities};
        }

    As a rule, all specificity names are lower case. Currently, they
    include:

    * alcalase

    * arg-cproteinase

    * asp-n_endopeptidase

    * asp-n_endopeptidase_glu

    * bnps_skatole

    * caspase_1

    * caspase_2

    * caspase_3

    * caspase_4

    * caspase_5

    * caspase_6

    * caspase_7

    * caspase_8

    * caspase_9

    * caspase_10

    * chymotrypsin

    * chymotrypsin_low

    * clostripain

    * cnbr

    * enterokinase

    * factor_xa

    * formic_acid

    * glutamyl_endopeptidase

    * granzymeb

    * hydroxylamine

    * iodosobenzoic_acid

    * lysc

    * lysn

    * ntcb

    * pepsin_ph1.3

    * pepsin

    * proline_endopeptidase

    * proteinase_k

    * staphylococcal_peptidase i

    * thermolysin

    * thrombin

    * trypsin

    or look at the regular expressions of their definitions in this same
    file.

  use_cache
    Turn caching on, trading memory for speed. Defaults to 0 (no caching).
    Useful when any method is being called several times with the same
    argument.

        my $p = Bio::Protease->new( specificity => 'trypsin', use_cache => 0 );
        my $c = Bio::Protease->new( specificity => 'trypsin', use_cache => 1 );

        my $substrate = 'MAAEELRKVIKPR' x 10;

        $p->digest( $substrate ) for (1..1000); # time: 5.11s
        $c->digest( $substrate ) for (1..1000); # time: 0.12s

  cache
    The cache object, which has to do the Cache::Ref::Role::API role. Uses
    Cache::Ref::LRU by default with a cache size of 5000, but you can set
    this to your liking at construction time:

        my $p = Bio::Protease->new(
            use_cache   => 1,
            cache       => Cache::Ref::Random->new( size => 50 ),
            specificity => 'trypsin'
        );

METHODS
  digest
    Performs a complete digestion of the peptide argument, returning a list
    with possible products. It does not do partial digests (see method "cut"
    for that).

        my @products = $enzyme->digest($protein);

  cut
    Attempt to cleave $peptide at the C-terminal end of the $i-th residue
    (ie, at the right). If the bond is indeed cleavable (determined by the
    enzyme's specificity), then a list with the two products of the
    hydrolysis will be returned. Otherwise, returns false.

        my @products = $enzyme->cut($peptide, $i);

  cleavage_sites
    Returns a list with siscile bonds (bonds susceptible to be cleaved as
    determined by the enzyme's specificity). Bonds are numbered starting
    from 1, from N to C-terminal. Takes a string with the protein sequence
    as an argument:

        my @sites = $enzyme->cleavage_sites($peptide);

  is_substrate
    Returns true or false whether the peptide argument is a substrate or
    not. Esentially, it's equivalent to calling "cleavage_sites" in boolean
    context, but with the difference that this method short-circuits when it
    finds its first cleavable site. Thus, it's useful for CPU-intensive
    tasks where the only information required is whether a polypeptide is a
    substrate of a particular enzyme or not
