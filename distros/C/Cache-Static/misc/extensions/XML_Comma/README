To use Cache::Static with XML::Comma documents and stores...

1) cache_static.macro must be installed in your defs directory
   (typically /usr/local/comma/defs or /usr/local/comma/defs/macros)
   (make install tries to do this automagically for you as of v 0.9901)
2) add <macro>cache_static</macro> to any def you want to be
   Cache::Static'able
3) start using it:

Cache::Static::get_if_same($key,
	[ "file|/tmp/somefile", 
	"_XML::Comma|Store|test3|main" ], 
	"_XML::Comma|Doc|test2|main|000026" ] );
