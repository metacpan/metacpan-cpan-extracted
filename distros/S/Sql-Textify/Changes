		- little fixes to make CPAN tests happy
		- new test suites, I'm not using test::most anymore
		- test sqlite only if DBD::Sqlite is installed
		- better regexp for removing C-style comments
		- also there's no need for sqltextify.pl to split the string (the textify script will do everything already) so I removed the split code.
		- little internal changes, updated Makefile.PL with better requires
