=head1 NAME

OpenTelemetry::SDK::Trace::Sampler::AlwaysOn - A sampler that will always sample

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $sampler = OpenTelemetry::SDK::Trace::Sampler::AlwaysOn->new;

    my $result = $sampler->should_sample( ... );

    unless ( $result->sampled ) {
        # this will never be reached :(
    }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides a sampler whose
L<should_sample|OpenTelemetry::SDK::Trace::Sampler/should_sample> method
will always return a L<result|OpenTelemetry::SDK::Trace::Sampler::Result> that
is both sampled and recording.

=head1 METHODS

This class implements the L<OpenTelemetry::SDK::Trace::Sampler> role.
Please consult that module's documentation for details on the behaviours it
provides.

=head2 new

    $sampler = OpenTelemetry::SDK::Trace::Sampler::AlwaysOn->new;

Returns a new instance of this sampler. Takes no arguments.

=head2 description

    $string = $sampler->description;

Returns the C<AlwaysOnSampler> string.

=head2 should_sample

    $result = $sampler->should_sample(
        context    => $context,
        trace_id   => $trace_id,
        kind       => $span_kind,
        name       => $span_name,
        attributes => \%attributes,
        links      => \@links,
    );

Returns a L<OpenTelemetry::SDK::Trace::Sampler::Result> that is both sampled
and recording. The L<OpenTelemetry::Propagator::TraceContext::TraceState> in
the result will be read from the context provided in the C<context> parameter,
or from the current context if none is provided.
