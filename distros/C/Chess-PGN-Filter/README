Chess/PGN/Filter version 0.15
=============================

This is a simple text filter, i.e. text in one side, reformatted text out the other side. This
release supports PGN to XML using an available DTD. It also supports a TEXT filter type that
attempts to normalize possibly non-standard PGN input. There is now a DOM output type that is
used primarily for debugging other filter types during development.
