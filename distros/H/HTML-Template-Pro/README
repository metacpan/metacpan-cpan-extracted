HTML-Template-Pro version 0.9509
==============================

DESCRIPTION

Original HTML::Template is written by Sam Tregar, sam@tregar.com
with contributions of many people mentioned there.
Their efforts caused HTML::Template to be mature html tempate engine
which separate perl code and html design.
Yet powerful, HTML::Template is slow, especially if mod_perl isn't 
available or in case of disk usage and memory limitations.

HTML::Template::Pro is a fast lightweight C/Perl+XS reimplementation
of HTML::Template (as of 2.9) and HTML::Template::Expr (as of 0.0.7). 
It is not intended to be a complete replacement, 
but to be a fast implementation of HTML::Template if you don't need 
quering, the extended facility of HTML::Template.
Designed for heavy upload, resource limitations, abcence of mod_perl.

HTML::Template::Pro has complete support of filters and HTML::Template::Expr's 
tag EXPR="<expression>", including user-defined functions.

HTML::Template work cycle uses 2 steps. First, it loads and parse template.
Then it accepts param() calls until you call output().
output() is its second phase where it produces a page from the parsed tree
of template, obtained in the 1st step.

HTML::Template::Pro loads, parse and outputs template on fly, 
when you call $tmpl->output(), in one pass. The corresponding code is 
written in C and glued to Perl using Perl+XS. As a result,
when compared to HTML::Template in ordinary calls, it runs 
10-25 times faster. Comparing to HTML::Template with all caching enabled
under mod_perl, it still 1-3 times faster. At that HTML::Template caching 
requires considerable amount of memory (per process, shareable, or on disk) 
to be permanently filled with parsed trees, whereas HTML::Template::Pro 
doesn't consume memory for caches and use mmap() for reading templates on disk.

INSTALLATION

This module is tested on Linux and FreeBSD. There are success reports 
on MacOS X, Solaris, Windows. Windows users should look at README.win32.
For Unixes it currently use POSIX mmap() system call, 
which may be unavaliable on some systems. 
In such case add argument MMAP=0 to perl Makefile.PL.

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

If you have libpcre installed try 
   perl Makefile.PL PCRE=1

other optional parameters include DEBUG (build with extra debug level)
and IMITATE (imitate behavior of HTML::Template in all circumstances,
even on broken templates, for a little cost of  perfomance).

So a fully fledged build is
   perl Makefile.PL PCRE=1 DEBUG=1 IMITATE=1

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules and libraries:

modules:
  File::Spec

libraries:
  libpcre (optional)

TODO

Add support for die_on_bad_params => 1.
Add support for quering.
Improve debug message subsystem.
