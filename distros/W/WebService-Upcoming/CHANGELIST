0.05 -- 06/18/2005

0.03 -- 06/15/2005
------------------

  client-side caching -- call() reimplemented as serial calls to these
* t/test.t now pulls test Upcoming API key from file instead of requiring
  test code to be edited
* Switch from XML::Parser::Lite::Tree to XML::Mini::Document, to avoid
  prerequisite problems on machines that don't have libexpat.so installed
* Reformatted response-object creation and method-and-request-type
  declarations to make them easier to read
* Replaced response-attribute quoting -- qw() with ('','',...) -- in each
  response-object to avoid triggering (spurious?) warning on various OS's
* Corrected scalar @ISA assignments in Upcoming.pm and in various response-
  object files
* Um... Removed a debugging profanity
