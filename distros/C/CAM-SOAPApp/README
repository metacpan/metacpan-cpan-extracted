DESCRIPTION

The standard Perl library for creating SOAP services is SOAP::Lite.
While powerful, that module is nearly incomprehensible and downright
idiosyncratic.  Here comes CAM::SOAPApp to the rescue!  We built this
package while writing our SOAP client implememtation for Flash, and
found it to be a huge time saver.  We also used it to debug Apple
Safari and Sherlock issues, enabling those broken tools to be good
web-service citizens.

This module implements a handy framework for deploying SOAP services.
It inherits all of the simplifications allowed by CAM::App.  Combined
with CAM::SOAPClient, CAM::SOAPApp can define a fully contained and
fault-tolerant client-server solution.  It also works well with any
SOAP implementation that can talk to SOAP::Lite -- and some that can't!

This package works around several different flaws in various SOAP and
HTTP implementations, using 'lenient' mode.  These solutions are very
valuable, let alone the rest of the module.

Note that the packages that you create for SOAP methods SHOULD NOT
subclass from this class!  That would be a security problem.  Please
see the example in the documentation for the right way to use the
CAM::SOAPApp module.  The regression tests implement a simple but
full-featured client and server running on localhost.
