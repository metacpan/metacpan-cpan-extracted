0.044	13 November 2006
	Corrected get and set method return values in array context for some error cases (where class type is unknown): now returns empty list when no values exist, instead of undef.
	
	Added new methods to SOAP::Data::ComplexType: as_soap_data_instance, as_xml_data_instance.

	Corrected minor content bug in POD.
	
0.041	19 May 2006
	Made autoload accessor, get, and set methods SOAP Array type aware, such that they now correctly return appropriate values depending on the caller context: list or scalar.
	
	Improved reliability of SOAP::Data::ComplexType::Builder::Element argument parsing.
	
	Rewrote SOAP::Data::ComplexType::Builder::Element method add_elem to correct type checking and fix buggy new object construction case.
	
	Changed autoload accessor method to return actual object values (i.e. SOAP::Data:ComplexType::Builder::Element objects or scalar data), instead of raw data.
	(Change actually occured in 0.04.)
	*NOTE* this breaks backward compatibility with scripts that depended on a raw data structure return result from autoload accessor methods.
	Also, do not depend on the type or structure of returned objects at this time, as this will be changing soon as internal package structure is optimized (next major release).

0.04	13 May 2006
	Added get() and set() accessor methods.  Autoload accessor methods changed to implement these methods.  get() will now return a list of values if the caller
	expects array form.
	
	When changing the value of an element, the return value is now the previous value
	that was stored before the change.  Also, SOAP::Data::ComplexType::Builder element is now supported as a valid value to set (multiple values may be specified within an arrayref).
	
	Deprecated and removed set_elem() method.
	
	Changed purpose of get_elem to return the actual object representation of that element, instead of the value.
	
	Added a comprehensive test suite.
	
	Fixed memory leak regarding circular references of parent objects in child objects.
	
	Added recursion detection and prevention in data structure passed to new() constructor.
	
	Added complete support for complex Array classes (that extend the SOAP Array class).
	
	Many internal architectural changes, including streamlining SOAP::Data::ComplexType::Builder and adding many support methods to SOAP::Data::ComplexType::Builder::Element.
	
	Corrected a minor object type checking bug in SOAP::Data::ComplexType::Builder method get_as_data.

0.031	27 February 2006
	SOAP::Data::ComplexType::AUTLOAD now warns with stack traces instead of dieing on them.
	Intention is to have run-time stability preferred without requiring exception traps everywhere in implementing applications (for now).
	
	Added eva{...} enclosure to SOAP::Data::ComplexType::as_raw_data(...) and SOAP::Data::ComplexType::Builder::serialize(...).
	
	Added object type checking in SOAP::Data::ComplexType::Builder get_as_raw(...), get_as_data(...), and add_elem(...).
	
	Overloaded SOAP::Data::ComplexType::Builder parent class find_elem(...) to handle better type checking.

0.03	25 January 2006
	Fixed minor error case handling syntax bug in set_elem().
	
	Fixed bug where if value were 0, SOAP::Data::ComplexType::Builder::get_as_data() would interpret this as undef.
	
	Added strict and warnings pragmas to all packages.
	
	Rewrote internals to support nested objects for constructor input.
	
	Support added for complexTypes with fields that can have more than once occurance (i.e. array-like types).
	
	Added documentation for new object methods.
	
	Misc documentation updates.

0.02	27 December 2005
	Added support for raw perl data dump of data structures: as_raw_data().
	
	Added get_elem() and set_elem() for access to nested elements and to elements who share names of object methods.
	
	Modified autoloader to return a raw perl data dump of node (instead of simple scalar dump.
	
	Added support of SOAP data or XML serialization of any arbitrary node (includes children) within the ComplexType object.
	
	Corrected bug in element attribute parsing.
	
	Minor bug fix in SOAP::Data::ComplexType::Builder::Element method value().

0.01	26 October 2005
	First public version of ComplexType.pm.
