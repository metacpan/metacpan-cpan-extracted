Net::SNPP was previously part of the libnet distribution. But has now
been separated out to a distribution of its own.

As of October 2, 2003, maintainership of this module has been taken over
by Al Tobey <tobeya@tobert.org>.

NEWS

I will be working to make Net::SNPP cover the complete rfc1861 specification
while adding tests for all of it.

I need feedback from people who use this to see what the impact of interface
changes would be.  I also would appreciate some test scenarios or code
snippets that you use so that I can try not to break things for you.  If
anything breaks in >=1.15 releases, you can blame me and be sure to send
all of your flames to me.

CHANGES

April 9, 2004: The message_response method in SNPP.pm was fixed to return server
codes properly.  Also, a few things in Server.pm were fixed up and documented
better.

Oct 2, 2003: Added bin/ directory with an snppd for testing, and two utilites
for sending and checking SNPP messages.  Added methods to SNPP.pm for more
RFC-compliant sending/checking of 2-way (level 3) messages.

INSTALLATION

Installation is the same as any other MakeMaker packaged distribution
from CPAN.

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make install

If you are on a machine where Makemaker does not run, or you do
not have a copy of make, then you can simply copy the contents of
the lib directory into your perl installation library directory.
However you will need to have Net::Cmd from libnet installed
