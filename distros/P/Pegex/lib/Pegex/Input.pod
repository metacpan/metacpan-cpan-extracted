=head1 NAME

Pegex::Input - Pegex Parser Input Abstraction

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Pegex;
    use Pegex::Input;
    my $ast = pegex($foo_grammar)->parse(Pegex::Input->new(string => $foo_input));

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Pegex::Parser parses input. The input can be a string, a string reference, a
file path, or an open file handle. Pegex::Input is an abstraction over any
type of input. It provides a uniform interface to the parser.

=head1 USAGE

You call new() with two arguments, where the first argument is the input type:

    Pegex::Input->new(file => 'file.txt')

The following input types are available:

=over

=item string

Input is a string.

=item stringref

Input is a string reference. This may be desirable for really long strings.

=item file

Input is a file path name to be opened and read.

=item handle

Input is from a opened file handle, to be read.
