SYNOPSIS

  use Win32::Screenshot;

  $image = CaptureRect( $x, $y, $width, $height );
  $image->Write('screenshot.png');

DESCRIPTION

The package utilizes some Win32 API function and Image::Magick to let
you capture the screen, a window or a part of it. The "Capture*(...)"
functions returns a new Image::Magick object which you can easily use to
modify the screenshot or to store it in the file. You can define your
own post processing handlers and chain them in the list.

There are Perl equivalents of Win32 API functions for working with
windows implemented in the package. These functions will allow easy
identification of windows on the screen.
