NAME

   XML::SAX::Simple

This is a SAX version  of  XML::Simple. It works exactly the same as XML::Simple,
so  see  the  documentation of that module for details. The benefit of using this
over XML::Simple is that XML::SAX::Simple will use any Perl SAX2 parser installed
on your system (via XML::SAX), rather than being hard coded to use XML::Parser.

   perl Makefile.PL
