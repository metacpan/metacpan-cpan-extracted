=head1 NAME

       lcfg-skeleton - Tool for creating new LCFG software projects

=head1 VERSION

This documentation refers to lcfg-skeleton version 0.5.0

=head1 USAGE

       $ lcfg-skeleton
       Name of the project: foo
       Is this an LCFG component? (yes/no) [yes]: 
       Short description of the project [The LCFG foo component]: 
       Name of the author [Stephen Quinney]: 
       Email address for the author [squinney@inf.ed.ac.uk]: 
       Language for component (perl/shell) [perl]: 
       Revision Control System (CVS/None) [CVS]: None
       Supported platforms [ScientificLinux5]: 
       Distribution license [GPLv2]: 
       Restart component on RPM update (yes/no) [yes]: 
       Use the CMake build system (yes/no) [yes]: 
       Check all changes are committed before a release? (yes/no) [yes]: 
       Generate the ChangeLog from the Revision-Control log? (yes/no) [yes]: 

Hitting RETURN will use the default value shown in []. The responses
to the question are normally stored in the file
B<~/.lcfg/skeleton/defaults.yml> (the location is configurable) and
will be used as the defaults next time the command is run.

Alternatively it is possible to pass in parameters from the
command-line and those values will be used as the defaults. You can
also run in a completely non-interactive mode where the defaults are
automatically accepted, you only need to specify the project name on
the command line. For example:

       lcfg-skeleton --name=foo --no-lcfg --no-gencmake \
                     --rcs=CVS --no-interactive

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The lcfg-skeleton script prompts the user for basic information and
creates a set of skeleton files as a starting point for writing a new
LCFG component.

Although this tool has been written primarily to aid in the generation
of LCFG component projects it is generally useful. It can be used for
any source code where you wish to use the LCFG software release tools.

=head1 REQUIRED ARGUMENTS

There are no required arguments for this command.

=head1 OPTIONS

Note that boolean values should be specified on the command-line like
C<--foo> or C<--no-foo>. At the interactive user query interface they
should be specified as "yes" or "no".

For convenience, on the command-line is is possible to use the
shortest unique name for each option.

=over 4

=item name

The name of the project. Note that in the case of an LCFG component
this should be C<foo> B<NOT> C<lcfg-foo>.

=item abstract

A short description of the project. If this is an LCFG component the
default value suggested to the user is "The LCFG $name component".

=item author_name

The name of the author (i.e you!). The default is the string stored in
the GECOS field of the passwd entry.

=item author_email

The email address for the author. The default is built from the
current username and domain name.

=item lcfg_component

This is a boolean value which controls whether the generated project
is an LCFG component.

=item lang

The language which will be used, this is either "perl" or
"shell". This only really has an affect if you are creating an LCFG
component.

=item rcs

Which revision-control system you intend to use for the
project. Currently only "CVS" and "None" are supported. You will need
the relevant L<LCFG::Build::VCS> helper module installed for this to
work.

=item platforms

The comma-separate list of platforms which are supported by this code
(e.g. ScientificLinux5).

=item license

The license under which the source code can be distributed. This
defaults to "GPLv2".

=item restart

This controls whether, if this is an LCFG component, should it be
restarted after package upgrade if the component is already
running. This is a yes/no answer and it defaults to "yes" (it is
handled in the same way as a boolean value on the command line).

=item gencmake

This is a boolean value which controls whether the LCFG CMake
infrastructure will be used to build the project.

=item genchangelog

This is a boolean value which controls whether or not to generate the
project changelog from the revision-control commit logs.

=item checkcommitted

This is a boolean value which controls whether the revision-control
tools should check that all files are committed before making a new
release.

=item interactive

This is a boolean value which controls whether the L<query_user()>
method will actually interact with the user or just store the values
taken from the defaults file and any commandline options. This is a
boolean value which defaults to false (zero).

=item force

This is a boolean value which controls whether an existing project
directory will be removed if the name matches that required for the
new skeleton project. This is a boolean value which defaults to false
(zero).

=item configfile

This is the configuration file which is used to store the defaults
between calls to the lcfg-skeleton tool. Normally you should not need
to modify this and it defaults to C<~/.lcfg/skeleton/defaults.yml>.

=item tmpldir

This is the directory into which local versions of templates should be
placed. Normally you should not need to modify this and it defaults to
C<~/.lcfg/skeleton/templates/>. For reference, the standard templates
are normally stored in C</usr/share/lcfgbuild/templates>.

=back

=head1 CONFIGURATION

If the new component is to be added automatically to the CVS, then the
C<CVSROOT> and C<CVS_RSH> must be set correctly before running
B<lcfg-skeleton>.

By default the script assumes that the standard template directory is
C</usr/share/lcfgbuild/templates>. You can override this using the
C<LCFG_BUILD_TMPLDIR> environment variable. If you have done a local
(i.e. non-root) install of this module then this will almost certainly
be necessary.

It is possible to override any of the standard templates used to
generate the skeleton project by placing your own version into the
directory referred to in the C<tmpldir> attribute. This is normally
C<~/.lcfg/skeleton/templates/> but that can be overridden by the
user.

=head1 EXIT STATUS

After successfully generating a new project this command will exit
with code zero. An error will result in a non-zero error code.

=head1 DEPENDENCIES

This script uses L<LCFG::Build::Skeleton> which is L<Moose>
powered. That module also requires L<MooseX::Getopt> for command-line
option handling. This module is part of the LCFG build tools suite and
as such requires L<LCFG::Build::Pkgspec> and L<LCFG::Build::VCS>. It
uses the perl Template Toolkit to generate new projects. The defaults
file is parsed and stored using L<YAML::Syck>. You will also need the
L<List::MoreUtils> and L<UNIVERSAL::require> modules.

=head1 SEE ALSO

L<LCFG::Build::Tools>, lcfg-reltool(1)

=head1 PLATFORMS

This is the list of platforms on which we have tested this
software. We expect this software to work on any Unix-like platform
which is supported by Perl.

ScientificLinux6, EnterpriseLinux7, MacOSX
