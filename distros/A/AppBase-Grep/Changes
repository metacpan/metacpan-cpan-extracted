          Also note that starting from now, AppBase::Grep might pass an

          value of 1 to mean to skip to the next "file" (or source). When a
          source is unaware of this and keep returning the remaining lines of
          the same "file"/source, `-l` mgiht report multiple lines of the same
          filename.
