Description

    Composes a request class from a base class plus a selection of applied
    roles

Configuration and Environment

    Defines the following attributes;

    buildargs

      A code reference. The default when called returns it's second
      argument. It is called with the factory object reference and the
      attributes for constructing the request. It is expected to return the
      hash reference used to construct the request object

    config

      A configuration object created by passing the "config_attr" to the
      constructor of the "config_class"

    config_attr

      Either a hash reference or an object reference or undefined.
      Overrides the hard coded configuration class defaults

    config_class

      A non empty simple string which is the name of the base configuration
      class

    request_class

      A non empty simple string which is the name of the base request class

Subroutines/Methods

 new_from_simple_request

       my $req = $factory->new_from_simple_request( $opts, $args, $query, $env );

    Returns a request object representing the passed parameters. The $opts
    hash reference is used to directly set attributes in the request
    object. The $args parameter is either a string of arguments after the
    path in the URI or an upload object reference. The $query hash
    reference are the keys and values of the URI query parameters, and the
    $env hash reference is the Plack environment
