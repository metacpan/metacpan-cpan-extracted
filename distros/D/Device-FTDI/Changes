        [CHANGES]
         * Support other wordsizes for SPI transfer, from 1 to 32 bits
         * Implement the SPI Device::Chip adapter using D:C:ProtocolBase::SPI
           and support the new ->write_then_read and ->read methods
         * Implement the '_no_ss' variant SPI methods

        [BUGFIXES]
         * Fix for certain stall conditions on Future logic with mixed
           reads/writes in the buffer

0.13    2017/01/08 23:41:06
        [CHANGES]
         * Add debugging prints to SPI MPSSE subclass
         * Improved I²C transfer speed

        [BUGFIXES]
         * Split writes longer than 1024 bytes into chunks to avoid stalling
           the device on buffer overruns

0.12    2016/10/02 22:18:57
        [CHANGES]
         * Rename 'CS' to 'SS' in the SPI subclass
         * Expose and document methods in SPI subclass for interacting
           directly with the SS pin
         * Define methods required for Device::Chip's split-transaction SPI
         * Add I2C read method
         * Add sleep method

        [BUGFIXES]
         * Ensure that failed recv still sends I²C STOP condition
         * Bugfix to Device::Chip::Adapter SPI protocol implementation to
           allow ->read and ->readwrite to actually work

0.11    2016/01/04 15:34:03
        [CHANGES]
         * Added 'autodie' feature
         * Implement the 'GPIO' Device::Chip::Adapter protocol

        [BUGFIXES]
         * Complain if MPSSE is used without a defined clock edge sense
         * Try 'libftdi1' as another platform library name (#6)

0.10    2015/11/12 12:10:27
        [CHANGES]
         * Implement Device::Chip::Adapter 0.02:
            + ->new_from_description constructor
            + I2C protocol
         * Have Device::Chip::MPSSE be a standalone class that composes a
           Device::FTDI rather than subclassing it

        [BUGFIXES]
         * Fix race condition where completed Device::FTDI::MPSSE write futures
           cause more writes that want more reads

0.09    2015/11/10 00:29:32
        [CHANGES]
         * Implement a Device::Chip::Adapter class
         * Make sure to correctly generate I²C STOP conditions
         * Fix POD errors

0.08    2015/11/07 18:34:18
        [CHANGES]
         * Added Device::FTDI::MPSSE; helper subclass for using MPSSE bitmode
         * Added Device::FTDI::SPI and ::I2C

0.07    2015/11/03 23:11:48
        [CHANGES]
         * Provide USB vendor/product ID constants
         * Provide an export tag for each constant group
         * Various documentation updates
            + a complete SYNOPSIS example program
            + barename =head2 function style
