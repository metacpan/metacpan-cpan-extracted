    Fix broken POD links, and add test to ensure they stay fixed.

    Third argument to 'set brick' is now fatal.

0.021		2018-08-24	T. R. Wyant
    Further deprecate third 'set brick' argument. It now warns on every
    use.

0.020		2018-05-28	T. R. Wyant
    Remove references to search.cpan.org. Sigh.

0.019		2018-02-27	T. R. Wyant
    Further deprecate third value for 'set brick'. It now warns on the
    first use. This was the puzzle size, which can be derived from the
    other two.

    Use manifest constants for reference types.

    Update metadata.

0.018		2016-03-01	T. R. Wyant
  Deprecate 3rd value in set( brick => ... );
    This has been documented as deprecated for some time. This update
    documents a deprecation schedule, and includes machinery to display
    deprecation warnings.

  Move clipboard functionality to module Clipboard. This module is
    optional; without it copy() and paste() throw exceptions.

  Add Makefile targets authortest, testcover.

0.017		2016-01-05	T. R. Wyant
  Add GitHub repository to metadata.

0.016		2015-11-11	T. R. Wyant
  Remove {Build,Makefile}.PL question about sudokug installation.  Also
    remove OS-specific code to build the executable if it is in fact
    being built.

0.015		2014-11-16	T. R. Wyant
   As of 2015-07-01, Makefile.PL and Build.PL will no longer prompt the
     user about installing sudokug, but default to installing it. The -n
     option will still suppress the installation. Also, the OS-specific
     functionality in these files will be removed.

0.014		2013-12-03	T. R. Wyant
   No code changes - just test tweaks.

0.013		2012-01-04	T. R. Wyant
   Remove unwanted cruft from Changes file, and bring it into compliance
      with Test::CPAN::Changes. Add xt/author/changes.t to be sure it
      stays that way.

0.012		2011-12-20	T. R. Wyant
   Update copy of Gnu GPL in LICENSES/Copying to have current FSF
      address.

0.011		2011-11-10	T. R. Wyant
   'use 5.006002', since that is the oldest Perl I can build.

   Eliminate calls to UNIVERSAL::can as a function.

   Load optional module Win32::Clipboard by file name, mostly so code
      analyzers do not see it as an undeclared dependency.

   Require Test::More for testing.

   Add tests for POD and Perl::Critic, and for file presence and
      executability.

   Author testing is now by the authortest target, which requires
      building via Build.PL. Author testing is no longer supported when
      building via Makefile.PL.

   Moved the modification log from the module POD to the Changes file.

   Revise copyright and license statement.

0.010		2008-09-14	T. R. Wyant
   Fixed Build.PL to heed -y and -n options.

0.009		2008-07-21	T. R. Wyant
   'use 5.006', for 'our' at the very least.

   Update 'SEE ALSO'

   add =head1 LICENSE to POD.

0.008		2008-05-09	T. R. Wyant
   Tweak docs.

   Support unused cells.

   Add drop_set() method to undo add_set().

   Add 'null' attribute to generate a puzzle with no topology.

   Add 'quincunx' attribute to generate a quincunx (a.k.a.
     'Samurai Sudoku')

0.007		2006-09-30	T. R. Wyant
   Corrected example in topology attribute documentation,
     and other documentation tweaks.

   Moved General.pm to lib/Games/Sudoku.

   Added Build.PL

   In bin/sudokug, added the 'webcmd' pseudo-attribute and fixed the
     'source' command.

0.006		2006-07-03	T. R. Wyant
   Fixed problem with 'set corresponding'. Thanks
       to David Jelinek of Central Michigan University
       for diagnosing the problem and finding a
       solution.

   Corrected spelling.

   Eliminated Scalar::Util::looks_like_number, since
       apparently ActivePerl does not have it.

   Add copy() method and autocopy attribute, for getting
       generated puzzles onto the clipboard.

   Add paste() method, for loading puzzles from the
       clipboard.

   Add unload() method.

   In bin/sudokug, allowed input to be redirected or piped in, and added
       -filter option.

0.005		2005-12-20	T. R. Wyant
   Added generate() method and generation_limit
       attribute.

   Added rows attribute. This changes the default
       output for 'multi-faced' puzzles.

0.004		2005-12-16	T. R. Wyant
   Added Dion cube (via 'set cube number').

0.003		2005-12-13	T. R. Wyant
   Added 'set corresponding' and 'set max_tuple'.

   Added cubic sudoku (via 'set cube').

   Fixed horrendous inefficiency in backtrack logic.

0.002		2005-12-11	T. R. Wyant
   Format solution nicely for multi-character symbols.

   Fixed error in values eliminated by a hidden tuple.

   Recoded 'set sudokug' in terms of 'set brick', thus
     fixing an error in generating the small squares.

   Added method add_set(), and recoded 'set sudokux' in
     terms of this and 'set sudokug', thus fixing the
     same error that 'set sudoku' had.

   Put spaces in the result of scalar constraints_used.

   Spiffed up the POD.

0.001		2005-12-09	T. R. Wyant
