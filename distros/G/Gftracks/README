Gftracks version 0.5
====================

Gftracks is a module intended for manipulation of gramofiles .track files.
Gramofile is a program for manipulation of wav-files especially for splitting 
into single tracks. 

The splitting process with gramofile is a two step one. In the first, the file
is analyzed for finding where the tracks begin and end, that information is
saved into a .tracks file. In the next step, this file is used for the actual 
splitting into tracks. 

With a record with well-defined tracks and a decent sound card, gramofile 
usually finds most of the tracks, but in some cases, the tracks may be 
difficult or impossible to find or some tracks may be split. The .tracks file
is quite easy to edit to adjust the beginning or end time of the tracks, but
due to the indexing used, it is more cumbersome to add or remove tracks. 

Gftracks will usually be used in interactive mode through the shell:

i.e.
export TRACKS=/home/morten/music.wav.tracks
perl -MGftracks -e shell;

until version 1.0, Gftracks will save the file with the extra extention .sav 
to avoid messing up an existing file.

TODO

- More flexibility when entering times
- Fix a cosmetic bug in how some times are displayed (an extra 0 may occur)
- When deleting a track, select if it is to be combined with the track before 
  or after (the default is the track after, except if the last track is 
  deleted)
