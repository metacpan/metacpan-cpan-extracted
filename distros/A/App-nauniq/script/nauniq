=head1 NAME

nauniq - Non-adjacent uniq

=head1 VERSION

This document describes version 0.111 of nauniq (from Perl distribution App-nauniq), released on 2023-12-27.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 nauniq [OPTION]... [INPUT [OUTPUT]]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<nauniq> is similar to the Unix command C<uniq> but detects repeated lines even
if they are not adjacent. To do this, C<nauniq> must remember the lines being
fed to it. It's basically a glorified form of something like these:

 % awk '!mem[$0]++' INPUT
 % perl -ne'print unless $mem{$_}++' INPUT

There are options to control memory usage: option to only remember a certain
number of unique lines, option to remember a certain number of characters for
each line, and option to only remember the MD5 hash (instead of the content) of
each line. There are also other options like append, forget, and so on.

=head1 EXIT CODES

0 on success.

255 on I/O error.

99 on command-line options error.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over

=item * --repeated, -d

Print only duplicate lines. The opposite of C<--unique>.

=item * --ignore-case, -i

Ignore case.

=item * --num-entries=N

Number of unique entries to remember. The default is -1 (unlimited). This option
is to control memory usage, but the consequence is that lines that are too far
apart will be forgotten.

=item * --skip-chars=N, -s

Number of characters from the beginning of line to skip when checking
uniqueness.

=item * --unique, -u

Print only unique lines. This is the default. The opposite of C<--repeated>.

=item * --check-chars=N, -w

The amount of characters to check for uniqueness. The default is -1 (check all
characters in a line).

=item * --append

Open output file in append mode. See also C<-a>.

=item * -a

Equivalent to C<--append --read-output>.

=item * --forget-pattern=S

This is an alternative to C<--num-entries>. Instead of instructing C<nauniq> to
remember only a fixed number of entries, you can specify a regex pattern to
trigger the forgetting the lines. An example use-case of this is when you have a
file like this:

 * entries for 2014-03-13
 foo
 bar
 baz
 * entries for 2014-03-14
 foo
 baz

and you want unique lines for each day (in which you'll specify
C<--forget-pattern '^\*'>).

=item * --md5

Remember the MD5 hash instead of the actual characters of the line. Might be
useful to reduce memory usage if the lines are long.

=item * --read-output

Whether to read output file first. This option works only with C<--append> and
is usually used via C<-a> to append lines to file if they do not exist yet in
the file.

=head1 FAQ

=head2 How do I append lines to a file only if they do not exist in the file?

You cannot do this with C<uniq>:

 % ( cat FILE ; produce-lines ) | uniq - FILE
 % ( cat FILE ; produce-lines ) | uniq >> FILE

as it will clobber the file first. But you can do this with C<nauniq>:

 % produce-lines | nauniq -a - FILE

=head1 CONTRIBUTING


To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull requests on
GitHub.

Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You can
simply modify the code, then test via:

 % prove -l

If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally on your
system), you can install L<Dist::Zilla>,
L<Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR>,
L<Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR>, and sometimes one or two other
Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps required beyond
that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.

=head1 BUGS

Please report any bugs or feature requests on the bugtracker website L<https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Dist/Display.html?Name=App-nauniq>

When submitting a bug or request, please include a test-file or a
patch to an existing test-file that illustrates the bug or desired
feature.
