NAME

    AnyEvent::Git::Wrapper - Wrap git command-line interface without
    blocking

VERSION

    version 0.10

SYNOPSIS

     use AnyEvent::Git::Wrapper;
     
     # add all files and make a commit...
     my $git = AnyEvent::Git::Wrapper->new($dir);
     $git->add('.', sub {
       $git->commit({ message => 'initial commit' }, sub {
         say "made initial commit";
       });
     });

DESCRIPTION

    DEPRECATED: May go away at some point.

    This module provides a non-blocking and blocking API for git in the
    style and using the data structures of Git::Wrapper. For methods that
    execute the git binary, if the last argument is either a code reference
    or an AnyEvent condition variable, then the command is run in
    non-blocking mode and the result will be sent to the condition variable
    when the command completes. For most commands (all those but status,
    log and version), the result comes back via the recv method on the
    condition variable as two array references, one representing the
    standard out and the other being the standard error. Because recv will
    return just the first value if called in scalar context, you can
    retrieve just the output by calling recv in scalar context.

     # ignoring stderr
     $git->branch(sub {
       my $out = shift->recv;
       foreach my $line (@$out)
       {
         ...
       }
     });
     
     # same thing, but saving stderr
     $git->branch(sub {
       my($out, $err) = shit->recv;
       foreach my $line(@$out)
       {
         ...
       }
     });

    Like Git::Wrapper, you can also access the standard output and error
    via the OUT and ERR, but care needs to be taken that you either save
    the values immediately if other commands are being run at the same
    time.

     $git->branch(sub {
       my $out = $git->OUT;
       foreach my $line (@$out)
       {
         ...
       }
     });

    If git signals an error condition the condition variable will croak, so
    you will need to wrap your call to recv in an eval if you want to
    handle it:

     $git->branch(sub {
       my $out = eval { shift->recv };
       if($@)
       {
         warn "error: $@";
         return;
       }
       ...
     });

CONSTRUCTOR

 new

     my $git = AnyEvent::Git::Wrapper->new('.');

    The constructor takes all the same arguments as Git::Wrapper, in
    addition to these options:

    cache_version

      The first time the version command is executed the value will be
      cached so that git version doesn't need to be executed again (via the
      version method only, this doesn't include if you call git version
      using the RUN method). The default is false (no cache).

METHODS

 RUN

    Run the given git command with the given arguments (see Git::Wrapper).
    If the last argument is either a code reference or a condition variable
    then the command will be run in non-blocking mode and a condition
    variable will be returned immediately. Otherwise the command will be
    run in normal blocking mode, exactly like Git::Wrapper.

    If you provide this method with a condition variable it will use that
    to send the results of the command. If you provide a code reference it
    will create its own condition variable and attach the code reference to
    its callback. Either way it will return the condition variable.

     # blocking
     $git->RUN($command, @arguments);
     
     # non-blocking callback
     $git->RUN($command, @arguments, sub {
       # $out is a list ref of stdout
       # $err is a list ref of stderr
       my($out, $err) = shift->recv;
     });
     
     # non-blocking cv
     my $cv = $git->RUN($command, @arguments, AE::cv);
     $cv->cb(sub {
       my($out, $err) = shift->recv;
     });

 status

    If called in blocking mode (without a code reference or condition
    variable as the last argument), this method works exactly as with
    Git::Wrapper. If run in non blocking mode, the Git::Wrapper::Statuses
    object will be passed back via the recv method on the condition
    variable.

     # blocking
     # $statuses isa Git::Wrapper::Statuses
     my $statuses = $git->status;
    
     # with a code ref
     $git->status(sub {
       # $statuses isa Git::Wrapper::Statuses 
       my $statuses = shift->recv;
       ...
     });
     
     # with a condition variable
     my $cv = $git->status(AE::cv)
     $cv->cb(sub {
       # $statuses isa Git::Wrapper::Statuses
       my $statuses = shift->recv;
       ...   
     });

 log

    This method has three different calling modes, blocking, non-blocking
    as commits arrive and non-blocking processed at completion.

    blocking mode

       $git->log(@args);

      Works exactly like Git::Wrapper

    as commits arrive

       # without a condition variable
       $git->log(@args, sub {
         # $commit isa Git::Wrapper::Log
         my $commit;
         ...
       }, sub {
         # called when complete
         ...
       });
       
       # with a condition variable
       my $cv = AnyEvent->condvar;
       $git->log(@args, sub {
         # $commit isa Git::Wrapper::Log
         my $commit;
         ...
        }, $cv); 
        $cv->cb(
          # called when complete
          ...
        });

      With this calling convention the first callback is called for each
      commit,as it arrives from git. The second callback, or condition
      variable is fired after the command has completed and all commits
      have been processed.

    at completion

       # with a callback
       $git->log(@args, sub {
         # @log isa array of Git::Wrapper::Log
         my @log = shift->recv;
       });
       
       # with a condition variable
       my $cv = AnyEvent->condvar;
       $git->log(@args, $cv);
       $cv->cb(
         # @log isa array of Git::Wrapper::Log
         my @log = shift->recv;
       });

      With this calling convention the commits are processed by
      AnyEvent::Git::Wrapper as they come in but they are gathered up and
      returned to the callback or condition variable at completion.

    In either non-blocking mode the condition variable for the completion
    of the command is returned, so you can pass in AE::cv (or
    AnyEvent-condvar>) as the last argument and retrieve it like this:

     my $cv = $git->log(@args, AE::cv);

 version

    In blocking mode works just like Git::Wrapper. With a code reference or
    condition variable it runs in blocking mode and the version is returned
    via the condition variable.

     # blocking
     my $version = $git->version;
    
     # cod ref
     $git->version(sub {
       my $version = shift->recv;
       ...
     });
     
     # cond var
     my $cv = $git->version(AE::cv);
     $cv->cb(sub {
       my $version = shift->recv;
       ...
     });

CAVEATS

    AnyEvent (a dependency of this module) is no longer supported on Perl
    5.22 or later by its author. It may work there, or it may not.

    This module necessarily uses the private _parse_args method from
    Git::Wrapper, so changes to that module may break this one. Also, some
    functionality is duplicated because there isn't a good way to hook into
    just parts of the commands that this module overrides. The author has
    made a good faith attempt to reduce the amount of duplication.

    You probably don't want to be doing multiple git write operations at
    once (strange things are likely to happen), but you may want to do
    multiple git read operations or mix git and other AnyEvent operations
    at once.
