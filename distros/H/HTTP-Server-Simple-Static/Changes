Revision history for Perl extension HTTP::Server::Simple::Static

0.14  Sat, 28 Oct 2017 14:53:00 +0100

        - Further improvements to the path handling to fix a bug with
          specifying the base directory using a relative path. Closes:
          https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=123428

0.13  Sun, 08 Oct 2017 09:38:00 +0100

        - Reworked file path handling to prevent attacker traversing
          out of the base directory. Closes:
	  https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=123178

0.12  Thu, 28 Apr 2016 06:30:00 +0100

        - Moved POD tests to xt/ directory so they are not run for
          normal user installs.

0.11  Wed, 27 Apr 2016 16:01:00 +0100

        - Added a mapping for *.js files to a Content-Type of
            application/javascript

0.10  Wed, 27 Apr 2016 14:45:00 +0100

        - Reworked how the value for the Content-Type header is
            selected. Simple regexp matching on the path suffix is
            used for *.html?, *.css and *.txt files. Any other files
            are checked using File::LibMagic as before. Closes:
            https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=113980 and
            https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=91321

0.09  Thu, 15 Aug 2013 09:08:00 +0100

        - Added support for clients which send an If-Modified-Since
            HTTP header in the request. We return a 304 if the file
            has not been changed.

0.08  Wed, 14 Aug 2013 17:00:00 +0100

        - Replaced File::MMagic and MIME::Types with File::LibMagic
            which should be more reliable.
            Closes: http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=39598
        - Improved docs and code example.
            Closes: http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=37701
        - Added support for the Last-Modified and Date HTTP headers,
            this consequently adds a new dependency on HTTP::Date.
	- Added support for not sending the content when the request
            method is HEAD.

        - Only serve files not directories, thanks to Bradley Bailey
          for the report.
          Closes http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=34068
        - Fixed url handling for requests from IE/
          Closes http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=27650
          
0.06  Mon, 23 Jul 2007 10:42:37 +0100

        - Fixed problem with handling empty files where they have no
          file extension or it is not recognised by MIME::Types.
          Thanks to Mark Stosberg for the report

0.05  Mon,  6 Nov 2006 09:29:42 +0000

        - Applied patch from Max Maischein to use the binmode function
          rather than the binmode method of IO::File, which only exists
          in newer versions of that module which we were not requiring.

0.04  Thu, 20 Jul 2006 12:03:21 +0100

        - Applied patch from Tom Hukins to make
          HTTP::Server::Simple::Static RFC compliant. Section 4.1 of
          RFC 2616, "Message Types", states that header fields should
          be separated by CRLF. This is done in the manner recommended
          in perlport(1).
        - Also applied patch from Tom Hukins to add the "use bytes"
          pragma to ensure Content-Length contains the number of bytes
          in the response body, not the number of characters.
        
0.03  Tue, 13 Jun 2006 11:00:58 +0100
        - Fixed documentation to show that HTTP::Server::Simple::CGI
          should be used as the base class.
          Closes: http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=18682
        - Switched to using IO::File for the file handling, also
          turned on binmode to help those on Windows serve images, etc.
