INSTALLATION

make
make test
make install

TESTING

This module requires the following module for thorough testing:

    Test::More

The following test modules are optional:

    Test::Pod
    Test::Pod::Coverage

It can also make use of Devel::Cover if available.

UNINSTALLATION

This is a pure-Perl module. The following one-liner should print
out the canonical path of the file:

  perl -MString::FixedLen -le 'print $INC{"String::FixedLen.pm"}'

Just delete this file. There is also the question of the man page.
Finding that is left as an exercise to the reader.

USAGE

use String::FixedLen;

tie my $str, 'String::FixedLen', 4;

$str = 'a';
$str .= 'cheater;        # "ache"
$str = "hello, world\n"; # "hell"
$str = 9999 + 12;        # "1001"

STATUS

This module is unlikely to be enhanced, but I'm interested in
hearing about any ideas in ways it could be improved, and I'll
(try to) fix any bugs I hear about.
