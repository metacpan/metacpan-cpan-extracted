Revision history for Dist-Zilla-PluginBundle-Author-TEAM

0.005     2020-11-16 05:00:39+08:00 Asia/Kuala_Lumpur
    No new features.

    Functional changes:

    - AutoPrereqs removed, since it was causing more trouble that it's worth
    (picks up "require" and other lines and can lead to dependency cycles)

    Bugs fixed:

    - pull in PodInherit 0.008 so that builds work without a
    patched Pod::Inherit.

    Avoid running xt/ tests twice

0.003     2020-06-08 14:02:42+08:00 Asia/Kuala_Lumpur
    Disables the No404s test, since some distributions can have
    thousands of links and the test is rarely useful.

    Also includes the $AUTHORITY info by default now.

    GatherPrune not fruitful - turns out that explicitly excluding
    dist.ini means that the resulting distribution does not include
    dist.ini, to my great surprise and consternation (thanks Grinnz)

0.001     2019-01-02 00:15:10+08:00 Asia/Kuala_Lumpur
    Initial version.
