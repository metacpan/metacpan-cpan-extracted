----------
IMPORTANT!
----------
Version 4 is a complete re-write of code and has NONE of the same
function calls or returns, so read the docs if you want to use it.

This module enable one to easily get official weather information from
NOAA, their "Zone Reports" and hourly "state roundups." I wanted to be
able to get his information quickly and easily for web pages, or the
command line, etc.

I've also started a List-Serv for this module for those interested.  Look at
http://fido.seva.net:8090/mailman/listinfo/weathernoaa for info to join

A quick example to get a current weather in Boston, MA is as simple as:

	use Geo::WeatherNOAA;
	print print_current('BOSTON','MA');
 
Would result with:
	At 12:00pm EST, Boston, MA was experiencing light rain at 
	45 F, wind is northeast at 10 mph.
