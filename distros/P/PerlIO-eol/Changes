    * Try to fix tests on alpine linux
        * https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=147506
        * Copy() vs. Move().

    * Fix the link to the GitHub repository in the metadata.
    * Make sure to remove *~ temporary files / cruft.
        * https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=123943
        * Thanks to KENTNL for the report.

0.16        2016-04-30

    * Hopefully get rid of some warnings on Solaris and other platforms with
      STDCHAR not "char".

    * Convert the distribution from Module-Install which has become
      undermaintained to Dist-Zilla.
    * Some implied enhancements such as pod coverage, VCS repository
      information and meta-data, removal of trailing whitespace, a LICENSE
      file, etc.

0.14        2006-12-15

    * Doc fixes.

0.13        2004-10-18

    * Coupling read() calls with CRLF line endings resulted in false
      positives in mixed encoding detection, if the read was on the
      CR/LF boundary.  Fixed.

0.12        2004-10-18

    * Building on threaded Perl versions was broken, due to a missing
      aTHX_ symbol.  Reported by Roberto Aguilar.

0.11        2004-10-16

    * Exceptions raised by '!' and '?' now includes the filename.
    * The exception is reworded as 'Mixed newlines found in "filename",
      or 'Mixed newlines found' if a filename cannot be obtained.

0.10        2004-10-16

    * In reading "LF!" and "LF?", when an incoming LF is found, simply remember
      it without altering the input buffer; this saves many Copy() calls.
    * Add a test on detecting mixed line endings in output streams.

0.09        2004-10-16

    * Mixed line endings may now be detected by appending '!' or '?' symbols
      to the line ending specifier, eg. ":eol(CRLF!)".
    * Unified read and write logic into OnceAndOnlyOnce macros.

0.08        2004-10-15

    * Macroize the inner write() loop too.
    * Further refactor common macros into eol.h.
    * LF and CR disciplines no longer need to allocate any additional memories
      during fill().
    * Test failures are now displayed in hex code for easier debugging.

0.07        2004-10-15

    * Safely frees allocated buffer memory during reads.
    * Also safely frees the "eol_r" marker when the layer is pushed.
    * Correct "unknown eol_w" diagnostics message.

0.06        2004-10-15

    * Macroize the inner fill() loop into fill.h, which saves many cycles.
    * In particular, 'LF' and 'Native' on LF platforms should now only have
      minimum overhead over ':raw' if the processed stream does not contain CRs.

0.05        2004-10-09

    * PerlIO_read() calls were returning unneeded errors when the
      read block is only partially filled.  Fix this by taking
      _read calls into our hands and save some bits of indirection.

0.04        2004-10-09

    * We now optionally exports CR, LF, CRLF and NATIVE constants,
      at requests from Chia-Liang Kao.
    * eol_is_mixed is now prototyped as ($).

0.03        2004-10-08

    * Fix building problems on Win32.
    * Support the "Native" eol style.
    * Added I/O-specific syntax like "LF-Native", which means reading with LF
      and writing to Native; this what "svn:eol-style = native" means.
    * Optionally exports a "eol_is_mixed" function, to determine whether a string
      has an inconsistent line ending style.

0.02        2004-10-07

    * Fixed the buffer offset problem on non-CRLF settings.
    * Trailing data for read operations were ignored.  Oops.

0.01        2004-10-07

    * Initial release to CPAN.
