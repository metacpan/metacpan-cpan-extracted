NAME

    R::DescriptionFile - R package DESCRIPTION file parser

VERSION

    version 0.003

SYNOPSIS

        use R::DescriptionFile;
    
        my $desc1 = R::DescriptionFile->parse_file("DESCRIPTION");
        print $desc1->{'Description'};
        print $desc1->get('Depends');
    
        my $desc2 = R::DescriptionFile->parse_text($desc_file_text);

DESCRIPTION

    This module provides a parser for R's DESCRIPTION file which is shipped
    with a R package and contains meta data of the R package.

    parse_file() or parse_text() returns object of this module class. It's
    a blessed hash, so fields of DESCRIPTION can be accessed via hash keys.
    There is also a get method which does the same thing.

    For dependency fields like Depends, Suggests, they would be parsed to
    hashrefs of the form { pkgname => version_spec }. For list fields like
    LinkingTo, URL, they would be parsed to arrayrefs.
