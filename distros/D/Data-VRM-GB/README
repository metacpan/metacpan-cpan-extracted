NAME

    Data::VRM::GB - Extract data about British vehicle registration marks

DESCRIPTION

    This module allows you to get age information based on a vehicle
    registration mark.

SYNOPSIS

        use Data::VRM::GB qw/decode_vrm/;
    
        my $vd = decode_vrm('AB56 RST');
        $vd->{start_date};
        $vd->{end_date};

LIMITATIONS

    The API is unstable - we haven't fully decided on the API and return
    data types yet.

EXPORTS

 decode_vrm

    A function which takes a VRM as its first and only argument, and
    returns a HASHREF with the keys start_date and end_date. Each of those
    keys has as its value a DateTime object, truncated to the 'day'.

    If the registration mark couldn't be decoded to a date, either because
    it's of an unrecognised format or is using a letter prefix that is not
    understood, then it will return undef.

    Before comparing these dates with another DateTime, you must ensure you
    truncate your DateTime to the day. If you have a time portion, you will
    get errors creeping in.

        DateTime->compare(
           decode_vrm('AB56 RST')->{end_date},
           $your_dt->truncate(to => 'day')
        );
