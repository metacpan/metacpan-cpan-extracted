4.  GNU make.

Installation:

1.  Untar the Tk-SimpleFileselect-<version> archive with the gunzip and 
    tar commands:

  # gzip -dc Tk-SimpleFileselect-<version>.tar.gz | tar xvf -
 
   or, using GNU tar,

  # tar zxvf Tk-SimpleFileselect-<version>.tar.gz

  # make

6.  If necessary, become root (via "su", for example), and 
    install the source files and documentation in the system's 
    site_perl library.

  # su
