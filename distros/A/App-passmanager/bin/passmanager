=head1 NAME

passmanager - Command-Line Shared Password Store

=head1 VERSION

version 1.113580

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 $ passmanager --help
 Available commands:
 
   commands: list the application's commands
       help: display a command's help screen
 
       init: initialize git repository and passphrase files
    newuser: provision a new user, or reset a user passphrase
       open: browse and edit the password repository

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This program manages one or more password stores which can be securely shared
and edited amongst a team. Each team member maintains their own passphrase to
access a password store.

Individual user passphrases can be changed and new users added. The password
store is a simple XML format which can easily be read by humans or the
L<XML::Simple> Perl module, and is maintained in a Git repository.

=head1 USAGE

The program C<passmanager> takes three commands as shown in L</SYNOPSIS>,
above. These allow you to initialise a new password store, access the store,
and add a new user to an existing store.

There can be multiple password stores (a default name is provided, or
overridden on the command line), and they are stored in a Git repository
(obviously, as binary files due to the encryption).

Use the C<--help> flag to see what options are available. In general you can
set the location of the Git repository, the name of the password store, and
your own username. Each of these has sane defaults shown in the help text.

=head1 PASSWORD HIERARCHY

A three tier system is provided to help organise passwords. The names of the
tiers have no special meaning - you can group passwords however you wish. The
first two tiers, called Categories and Services, are simply containers.  The
third tier, Entries, holds multiple password details.

Entry

Categories and Services have only a title. The password Entry itself has a
tile, username, password, and comment field. In each case the title is
required, and for entries, either of the username or password is required.

=head1 INITIAL SET-UP

 $ passmanager init

Call the initialisation command as shown, and you will be prompted for your
own passphrase (twice) and the master passphrase for the store (also twice).
Then the Git repository will be initialised and you are shown the password
management interface.

Subsequently, run the application with the C<open> command and you will be
prompted for your own passphrase:

 $ passmanager open

Use the C<--help> flag to see what options are available. In general you can
set the location of the Git repository, the name of the password store, and
your own username. Each of these has sane defaults shown in the help text.

My thanks to Guy Edwards who collaborated on the original version of this
