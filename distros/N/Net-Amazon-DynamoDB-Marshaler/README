NAME

    Net::Amazon::DynamoDB::Marshaler - Translate Perl hashrefs into
    DynamoDb format and vice versa.

SYNOPSIS

      use Net::Amazon::DynamoDB::Marshaler;
    
      my $item = {
        name => 'John Doe',
        age => 28,
        skills => ['Perl', 'Linux', 'PostgreSQL'],
      };
    
      # Translate a Perl hashref into DynamoDb format
      my $item_dynamodb = dynamodb_marshal($item);
    
      # $item_dynamodb looks like:
      # {
      #   name => {
      #     S => 'John Doe',
      #   },
      #   age => {
      #     N => 28,
      #   },
      #   skills => {
      #     SS => ['Perl', 'Linux', 'PostgreSQL'],
      #   }
      # };
    
      # Translate a DynamoDb formatted hashref into regular Perl
      my $item2 = dynamodb_unmarshal($item_dynamodb);

DESCRIPTION

    AWS' DynamoDB <http://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/> service expects
    attributes in a somewhat cumbersome format in which you must specify
    the attribute type as well as its name and value(s). This module
    simplifies working with DynamoDB by abstracting away the notion of
    types and letting you use more intuitive data structures.

    There are a handful of CPAN modules which provide a DynamoDB client
    that do similar conversions. However, in all of these cases the
    conversion is tightly bound to the client implementation. This module
    exists in order to decouple the functionality of formatting with the
    functionality of making AWS calls.

    NOTE: this module does not yet support Binary or Binary Set types. Pull
    requests welcome.

CONVERSION RULES

    See <the AWS
    documentation|dynamoDb-marshaler|http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/HowItWorks.NamingRulesDataTypes.html#HowItWorks.DataTypes>
    for more details on the various types supported by DynamoDB.

    For a given Perl value, we use the following rules to pick the DynamoDB
    type (and vice-versa for un-marshaling):

      1. If the value is undef, use Null ('NULL')

      2. If the value looks like a number, use Number ('N').

      3. For any other non-reference, use String ('S').

      4. If the value is an arrayref, use List ('L').

      5. If the value is a hashref, use Map ('M').

      6. If the value isa boolean, use Boolean ('BOOL').

      7. If the value isa Set::Object, use either Number Set ('NS') or
      String Set ('SS'), depending on whether all members look like numbers
      or not. All members must be defined, non-reference values, or an
      error will be thrown.

      8. Any other value will throw an error.

EXPORTS

    By default, dynamodb_marshal and dynamodb_unmarshal are exported.

 dynamodb_marshal

    Takes in a "normal" Perl hashref, transforms it into DynamoDB format.

      my $attrs_marshalled = dynamodb_marshal($attrs);

 dynamodb_unmarshal

    The opposite of dynamodb_marshal.

      my $attrs = dynamodb_unmarshal($attrs_marshalled);
