NAME
    Log::UDP::Client - A simple way to send structured log messages via UDP

VERSION
    version 0.20.2

SYNOPSIS
        use Log::UDP::Client;

        # Send the simple scalar to the server
        Log::UDP::Client->new->send("Hi");

        # Log lots of messages
        my $logger = Log::UDP::Client->new(server_port => 15000);
        my $counter=0;
        while(++$counter) {
            $logger->send($counter);
            last if $counter >= 1000;
        }

        # Send some debugging info
        $logger->send({
            pid     => $$,
            program => $0,
            args    => \@ARGV,
        });

        # Use of JSON serializer
        my $logger = Log::UDP::Client->new( serializer_module => 'JSON' );

        # Will emit { "message" => "Hi" } because JSON want to wrap stuff into a hashref
        $logger->send("Hi");

        # Use of custom serializer
        use Storable qw(freeze);
        my $logger = Log::UDP::Client->new (
            serializer => sub {
                return nfreeze( \( $_[0] ) );
            },
        );

DESCRIPTION
    This module enables you to send a message (simple string or complicated
    object) over an UDP socket to a listening server. The message will be
    encoded with a serializer module (default is Storable).

ATTRIBUTES
  server_address : Str
    IP address or hostname for the server you want to send the messages to.
    This field can be changed after instantiation. Default is 127.0.0.1.

  server_port : Int
    Port for the server you plan to send the messages to. This field can be
    changed after instantiation. Default is port 9999.

  throws_exception : Bool
    If errors are encountered, should we throw exception or just return?
    Default is return. Set to true for exceptions. You can change this flag
    after instantiation.

  socket : IO::Socket::INET
    Read-only field that contains the socket used to send the messages.

METHODS
  send($message)
    Instance method that actually encodes and transmits the specified
    message over UDP to the listening server. Will die if throw_exception is
    set to true and some kind of transmission error occurs. The message will
    be serialized by the instance-defined serializer. Returns true on
    success.
