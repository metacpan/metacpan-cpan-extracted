NAME
    File::Copy::Undoable - Copy file/directory using rsync, with undo
    support

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.130 of File::Copy::Undoable (from Perl
    distribution File-Copy-Undoable), released on 2023-11-21.

FUNCTIONS
  cp
    Usage:

     cp(%args) -> [$status_code, $reason, $payload, \%result_meta]

    Copy file/directory using rsync, with undo support.

    On do, will copy "source" to "target" (which must not exist beforehand).
    On undo, will trash "target".

    Fixed state: "source" exists and "target" exists. Content or sizes are
    not checked; only existence.

    Fixable state: "source" exists and "target" doesn't exist.

    Unfixable state: "source" does not exist.

    This function is not exported.

    This function is idempotent (repeated invocations with same arguments
    has the same effect as single invocation). This function supports
    transactions.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   rsync_opts => *array[str]* (default: ["-a"])

        Rsync options.

        By default, "-a" is used. You can add, for example, "--delete" or
        other rsync options.

    *   source* => *str*

        (No description)

    *   target* => *str*

        Target location.

        Note that to avoid ambiguity, you must specify full location instead
        of just directory name. For example: cp(source=>'/dir',
        target=>'/a') will copy /dir to /a and cp(source=>'/dir',
        target=>'/a/dir') will copy /dir to /a/dir.

    *   target_group => *str*

        Set group of target.

        See "target_owner".

    *   target_owner => *str*

        Set ownership of target.

        If set, will do a "chmod -Rh" on the target after rsync to set
        ownership. This usually requires super-user privileges. An example
        of this is copying files on behalf of user from a source that is
        inaccessible by the user (e.g. a system backup location). Or,
        setting up user's home directory when creating a user.

        Will do nothing if not running as super-user.

    Special arguments:

    *   -tx_action => *str*

        For more information on transaction, see L<Rinci::Transaction>.

    *   -tx_action_id => *str*

        For more information on transaction, see L<Rinci::Transaction>.

    *   -tx_recovery => *str*

        For more information on transaction, see L<Rinci::Transaction>.

    *   -tx_rollback => *str*

        For more information on transaction, see L<Rinci::Transaction>.

    *   -tx_v => *str*

        For more information on transaction, see L<Rinci::Transaction>.

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element ($status_code) is an integer containing HTTP-like status
    code (200 means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second
    element ($reason) is a string containing error message, or something
    like "OK" if status is 200. Third element ($payload) is the actual
    result, but usually not present when enveloped result is an error
    response ($status_code is not 2xx). Fourth element (%result_meta) is
    called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information, much like how HTTP response headers provide additional
    metadata.

    Return value: (any)

FAQ
  Why do you use rsync? Why not, say, File::Copy::Recursive?
    With "rsync", we can continue interrupted transfer. We need this ability
    for recovery. Also, "rsync" can handle hardlinks and preservation of
    ownership, something which File::Copy::Recursive currently does not do.
    And, being implemented in C, it might be faster when processing large
    files/trees.

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR,
    Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps
    required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
