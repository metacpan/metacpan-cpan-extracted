- Fix flapping RSA generation test.
- Exclude broken Math::BigInt::LTM.
- Exclude broken/hang-prone Math::ProvablePrime.

0.36 Wed Nov 17 2021
- Report test coverage in POD. (No code changes.)

0.35 Wed Nov 17 2021
- BUG FIX: Export of ECDSA public keys now uses the proper PEM header.
- BUG FIX: A few syntax errors in oddball error cases are fixed.
- BUG FIX: Typo on unknown “kty” in JWK parse.

- CI moved to GitHub; Cygwin is now checked as well as Linux, macOS, & Windows.

0.34 Mon Sep 28 2020
- Deterministic ECDSA support added. sign_jwa() now always uses it,
  and new sign_sha256() et al. methods encourage it for plain signatures.
  PKCS10 and X509v3 signatures use it as well.

0.33 Mon Aug 10 2020
- Switch EC point multiplication algorithm to thwart timing attacks.
  (reported by Antonio de la Piedra)

0.32 Thu Jun 4 2020
- Fix issue #14: Fix ECDSA verify when r and s are small.
  (reported by Antonio de la Piedra)

0.31 Tue Feb 11 2020
- Fix ed25519 support detection.
- Recommend Math::BigInt::GMP.
- Add additional ECDSA key parse test.
- Drop Math::Utils dependency.

0.27 Sat Jul 28 2018
- Teach PKCS10.pm how to create CSRs with Ed25519.
- Lazy-load Digest::SHA in X509v3.pm and PKCS10.pm since it’s no longer
  a given that that module will be useful.

0.26 Sat Jul 28 2018
- Teach X509v3.pm how to create certificates with Ed25519.

0.25 Tue Jul 24 2018

- Skip OpenSSL digest verification on OpenSSLs that can’t verify
  against a private key.
- Remove superfluous Module::Load uses.
- Update README.pod.

0.13 Tue Jan 03 2017
