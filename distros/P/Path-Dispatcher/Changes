Revision history for Path-Dispatcher

1.06 2015-02-18
        Switch packaging system to Dist::Zilla (David Pottage)
            https://github.com/sartak/path-dispatcher/pull/1
            Thanks to the CPAN Pull Request Challenge :)

1.05 Thu Mar 14 2013
        eval q{$'} before regex match when needed to soothe bleadperl
            Thanks Dave Mitchell! http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/2013/03/msg200156.html

1.04 Thu Sep 1 2011
        Explicitly depend on Test::Fatal (reported by Jérôme Quelin  [rt.cpan.org #70666])
        Convert all tests from Test::Exception to Test::Fatal

1.03 Tue Aug 30 2011
        Provisional support for arbitrary payloads, not just code blocks, as results
            See https://github.com/sartak/path-dispatcher/blob/master/t/200-payload.t
        Eventually blocks will be deprecated, but not for a while. Internally blocks are
        rewritten as payloads so if you're doing deep magic with PD you may be exposed to
        that implementation detail.

        Various improvements to the handling of $match->leftover with undef

1.01 Sun Oct 24 2010
        Skip t/026-named-captures.t if you don't have 5.10.1

        Give matches a ->parent for inspecting an Under prefix rule's
            captures etc

1.00 Sun Oct 17 2010
        Bump to 1.0 to indicate back compat breakage

        Add match->named($key) for pulling out a named capture

        Use Try::Tiny to avoid swallowing exceptions (rafl)

0.16 Sun Oct 17 2010
        ** BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: Pass the match object into rule
        **    blocks rather than assigning $1, $2, $3. Use ->pos(1), (2), (3),
        **    etc. instead. This cleans up the code a lot and makes
        **    Path-Dispatcher more flexible.

        Add support for named captures

        Make all attributes read-only. If you need something to be read-write,
            I am open to such a change. Just let me know!

        Make _dispatcher_rule private

        Remove trace/readable_attribute/name support. This wants to be
            implemented in a different, better, more comprehensive way.

        Add documentation for shell tab completion

        Plenty other updated documentation

0.15 Tue Mar 16 09:40:40 2010
        ** Factored Path-Dispatcher-Declarative into its own distribution
        ** Be sure to update your dependency lists!

        Implement ->complete for Rule::Dispatch

        Add Path::Dispatcher::Rule::Alternation

        Implement case insensitivity for Rule::Eq

        Add Path::Dispatcher::Rule::Sequence - like Rule::Tokens but
            better!

        Add Path::Dispatcher::Rule::Enum

        Path autoboxing has been factored out into a private method for
            more overridability

        A few documentation improvements as usual :)

0.14 Thu Dec 31 13:18:19 2009
        Add Path::Dispatcher->complete for tab-completion

        Handle delimiters better in Path::Dispatcher::Rule::Tokens

        Factor out a _prefix method for rules to simplify their logic

0.13 Sun Aug 9 13:38:19 2009
        Add unshift_rule to classes that do Role::Rules

        Several distribution improvements

0.12 Fri Apr 17 03:21:05 2009
        Fix a bug with undefined capture variables being converted to the
            empty string and throwing warnings (reported by obra)

        Give Path::Dispatcher::Rule::Dispatch a "rules" method

0.11 Wed Apr 15 02:47:50 2009
        Fix some misnamed keys caused by de-AttributeHelper-ing

        Stop using some deprecated Moose features

        Doc fixes (Sartak and confound)

0.10 Fri Mar 6 23:40:42 2009
        The way you specify token_delimiter and case_sensitive_tokens has
            changed! You now say:
                use Path::Dispatcher::Declarative -base, -defaults => {
                    token_delimiter       => '/',
                    case_sensitive_tokens => 0,
                };

        Added Path::Dispatcher::Cookbook (grink)

        Added Path::Dispatcher::Builder which now backs
            Path::Dispatcher::Declarative (grink)

        then {} rule which is an "always" with that uses next_rule (grink)

        chain {} rule which is like Catalyst's chain (grink)

        Remove the last vestiges of stages (Sartak)

        Many minor fixes (Sartak)

0.09 Mon Feb 9 21:12:18 2009
        Avoid using method modifiers since it's potentially another dep.

0.08 Thu Feb 5 12:15:38 2009
        Inline uses of MooseX::AttributeHelpers.

        Now use "Any::Moose" (basically Squirrel done right)

0.07 Wed Jan 28 01:39:37 2009
        Paths are now boxed with the new Path::Dispatcher::Path.

        New rule type "Intersection" which matches only when each of its
        subrules match.

        New rule type "Metadata" which matches the optional metadata (a hash)
        of the path. The sugar for this is: on { foo => "bar" }

        New rule type "Eq" which just does basic string equality.

        Rules can now be named. In Path::Dispatcher::Declarative, each rule is
        named with its dispatcher's name and the file:line where the rule was
        defined.

        Dispatch tracing output, for debugging. Set environment variable
        PATH_DISPATCHER_TRACE to a number. The higher the number, the more
        output will be generated. The current maximum value of 10 will dump
        code references.

0.06 Sat Nov 15 21:02:29 2008
        New rule type "Empty" which matches only the empty path.

        Declarative:
            on '' now matches only the empty path.

0.05 Sat Nov 15 16:36:41 2008
        Improve test coverage
        New rule type "Always" which always matches.

        Match:
            ends_dispatch is now an attribute

        Rule::Tokens:
            Support for case insensitive matching
            Fix for tokens' type constraint

        Dispatcher:
            Allow rules to be specified in the constructor (a typo prevented it)

        Dispatch:
            first_match, has_match methods which do what you'd expect
            The run method will now collect return values and return them

        Declarative:
            redispatch_to sugar which adds a Dispatch rule
            "on '' => sub" as a special case will match all paths


0.04 Tue Oct 28 17:56:41 2008
        Dist fixes

0.03 Tue Oct 28 17:42:47 2008
        "rewrite" rules
        Super dispatchers are GONE! Yay.
        New Rule::Dispatch which just takes some other dispatcher. nothingmuch++

        Rule::Tokens:
            Fix for always matching just a prefix whether you wanted to or not
            Make tokenization and untokenization into methods for overriding

        Declarative:
            -base is required, otherwise unrelated modules using your dispatcher
                would get their @ISA set!


0.02 Mon Oct 20 14:10:12 2008
        Documentation!
        Prefix matches
        "under" rules
        Remove stages until they're actually needed

        Rule:
            The codeblock is no longer required
            Empty tokens are ignored
            The token attribute is now 'delimiter' instead of 'splitter'
            Allow regexes and alternations in the token rules

        Match:
            No longer Dispatch::Match
            Created by the Rule instead of the Dispatcher

        Declarative:
            You now must subclass Path::Dispatcher::Declarative
            Allow overriding the token delimiter

0.01 Wed Aug 27 11:04:18 2008
        Initial release
