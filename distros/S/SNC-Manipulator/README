DESCRIPTION

    SNC::Manipulator provides a perl interface to all the functions
    available through Sony's control software (and more) on SNC-RZ30N webcams.

USAGE

    new()
      Constructor.
      Returns new instance of SNC::Manipulator.


    setDelay( $delay )
      parameters:
        $delay, time in milliseconds.

      sets delay between requests in some functions; an example of this is in move().
      the default delay is 500.


    inquiry( $inqjs )
      parameters:
        $inqjs, string passed to inquiry function

      Gets data from camera; and structures inside instance like this:
      $instance{sysinfo}{TitleBar} = "Name of Room";

      Returns hash structured like %h{TitleBar} = "Name of Room";


    move( $moveinst )
      parameters:
        $moveinst, movement instruction;
          Compass direction (NSEW), In, Out, Home

      Moves camera according to the $movinst, for the approximateally the duration
      of the "delay" (whatever was set with setDelay, or default)
    
 
    moveDirectPT( $x, $y )
      parameters:
        $x, integer between 0 and 640
        $y, integer between 0 and 480

      Moves camera according to the xy point of $x and $y;
      accordingly to the current view of the camera.


    moveRelative( $moveDirection, $movePercentage )
      parameters:
        $moveDirection, compass direction.
        $movePercentage, 10,15,20,25,30,40,50,66.7,83.3, or 100.

      Moves camera accordingly to the $moveDirection by the
      percentage of the screen found in $movePercentage.


    moveToPreset( $preset )
      parameters:
        $preset, preset number.

      Moves camera to preset $preset.


    stop()

      Internal function.

      This will only need to be called if you wish to
      halt the camera's movement for some reason.


    rawVISCA( $visca )
      parameters:
        $visca, VISCA statement

      For use by people who know how to build a VISCA statement.


    captureToFile( $file )
      parameters:
        $file, filename to record current snapshot image to.

      Records current snapshot image (oneshotimage.jpg)


    setLogin( $username, $password )
      parameters:
        $username, camera username
        $password, camera password

      Sets the credentials for the camera.


    sendRequest( $type, $code )
      parameters:
        $type, 'visca', 'directpt', 'relative', or 'inquiry'
        $code, string to pass to camera

      Internal function.

      You will never need to call this.


    customDelay()
