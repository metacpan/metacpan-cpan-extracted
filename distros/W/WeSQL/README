Apache::WeSQL version 0.53
==========================

The Web-enabled SQL (WeSQL) Apache mod_perl module is an extension to HTML, 
acting as a glue between HTML and SQL. It allows the use of pure SQL queries 
directly in HTML files, embedded in a special tag. WeSQL translates the special 
tags into pure HTML, so using WeSQL is transparant for the browser. WeSQL is 
aimed at rapid web-database integration. WeSQL is written entirely in Perl 
and currently supports both MySQL and PostgreSQL as backend SQL databases.

In this directory, you will also find a '.spec' file to create a WeSQL rpm.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

Please note that 'make test' will NOT work on versions of Perl older than 5.006. 
This is nothing to worry about (but do consider upgrading your Perl, because 
older than 5.006 is truely ancient! I recommend perl 5.6.1).

CONFIGURATION

The sample Addressbook application is provided in this directory in the 
'addressbook' directory. See ./addressbook/README for information on how to 
install it.

See the Apache::WeSQL manpage for more information on how to get a new WeSQL going.

DEPENDENCIES

Prerequisites for an easy installation: a unix system with working Apache, perl, 
mod_perl, and MySQL or PostgreSQL. We want to interface to a database, so we need 
several Perl modules (do yourself a favour and get the latest versions!):

DBI
Data-ShowTable
ApacheDBI
DBI-Mysql or DBD-Pg

But if you are brave, there is no reason why WeSQL should not run on any system 
with any webserver that can execute Perl code as cgi-scripts, and can connect to a 
MySQL or PostgreSQL server.
