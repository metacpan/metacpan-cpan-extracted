NAME
    warnings::MaybeFatal - make warnings FATAL at compile-time only

SYNOPSIS
       use strict;
       use warnings qw(all);
       use warnings::MaybeFatal;
   
       # Use of uninitialized value.
       # Run-time warning, so this is non-fatal.
       print join(undef, "a", "b");
   
       # Useless use of constant in void context.
       # Compile-time warning, so this is fatalized.
       "Hello world"; 1;

DESCRIPTION
    Because it's kind of annoying if a warning stops your program from being
    compiled, but it's *really* annoying if it breaks your program part way
    through actually executing.

    This lexically scoped pragma will make all warnings (including custom
    warnings emitted with the `warn` keyword) FATAL during compile time. It
    does not enable or disable any warnings in its own right. It just makes
    any warnings that happen to be enabled FATAL during the compile.

    (Note that the compile phase and execute phase are not as cleanly divided
    in Perl as they are in, say, C. If module X loads module Y at run-time,
    then module Y's compile time happens during module X's run-time. In this
    situation, a warning that is triggered while compiling Y will be FATAL,
    even though from module X's perspective, this is at run-time.)
