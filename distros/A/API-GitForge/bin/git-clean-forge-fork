=head1 NAME

git-clean-forge-fork - create tidy forks for pull requests

=head1 VERSION

version 0.003

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<git clean-forge-fork> [B<--upstream=>I<REMOTE>]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Creates a fork for proposing changes to a project hosted on a git
forge, like GitHub or GitLab.  Also configures the fork to make it
obvious that it only exists for submitting changes, so that the fork
clutters up your git forge profile a bit less.  Also adds a 'fork'
remote to which you can push your proposed changes.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<--upstream=>I<REMOTE>

Specify the name of the upstream git remote, i.e., what you want to
fork.  Defaults to "origin".

=head1 FILES

=over 4

=item $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/.config/gitforge/access_tokens/I<DOMAIN>

Where I<DOMAIN> is the domain name of the git forge
(e.g. "github.com", "salsa.debian.org"), this file should contain an
API access token to log in to your account at the git forge.  If
unset, $XDG_CONFIG_HOME defaults to ~/.config.
