Revision history for MooseX-Role-Parameterized

1.11      2019-07-16 01:33:16Z
   - remove MooseX::Role::WithOverloading from test dependencies (RT#130075)

1.10      2017-04-20 17:50:53Z
   - add MooseX::Role::Parameterised as stub documentation, for
     discoverability

1.09      2016-08-07 01:20:31Z
   - Give 'anonymous' generated roles names that are similar to the original
     parameterized role so debug output is easier to read

1.08      2014-08-23 22:38:12Z
    - add x_breaks metadata for incompatibility issue with MooseX::Storage
      (now resolved with MooseX-Storage-0.47)

1.07      2014-08-06 05:44:11Z
    - re-release to remove README.pod from shipped dist

1.06      2014-08-02 04:34:06Z
    - Restored MooseX::Role::Parameterized->current_metaclass as a public
      method. Apparently there is code on CPAN that relies on this.

1.05      2014-07-31 18:26:03Z
    - If a parameterizable role was reinitialized after any parameters or a
      role block was declared, those declarations were lost. Reinitialization
      usually occurs when new metaroles are applied to the role by other
      MooseX modules.

1.04      2014-07-31 14:53:26Z
    - Convert this distribution to Dist::Zilla to resolve packaging insanity

1.03  2014-07-30
    - This extension is now implemented as a role metarole, which means it can
      (mostly) cooperate with other role extensions, such as
      MooseX::Role::WithOverloading. Note that you should load
      MooseX::Role::Parameterized _after_ other extensions.
    - This module no longer supports passing a "-metaclass" parameter when you
      load it. This was an artifact from a much earlier era of Moose
      extensions.
    - repository migrated to the github moose organization

1.02  2013-09-11
    - set %INC entries in test to avoid failures with
      Moose pre-2.11 (kentfrederic)
        https://github.com/sartak/MooseX-Role-Parameterized/pull/7
        https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=88593

1.01  2013-09-10
    - removed use of deprecated Class::MOP::load_class (ether)

1.00  2012-01-12
    - MooseX::Role::Parameterized now depends on Moose 2.0300
      released 2011-09-23 for its several core improvements, hence the
      major version number bump.

    - MXRP now uses the new meta_lookup feature added to Moose 2.0300
      (specifically for MXRP) to avoid duplicating Moose-0.60-era
      Moose::Role sugar. This means the error messages you get are
      better, and there's a lot less ugly code in MXRP.
    - Remove alias/excludes special case errors. They have long since been
      replaced in core Moose by -alias and -excludes, and were finally
      removed in Moose 2.0200.
    - Expressly forbid using role { } inside role { } (which makes no
      sense but I suppose you could accidentally trigger it)
    - Documentation fix from cweyl@alumni.drew.edu
      https://github.com/sartak/MooseX-Role-Parameterized/pull/5

0.27  2011-08-22
    - Remove MooseX::Role::Parameterized::Meta::Parameter; instead,
      the default for parameters of (is => 'ro') is set by the
      "parameter" sugar. This removes an unnecessary metaclass and
      removes weird edge cases caused by it. Please please please
      report any breakage!

0.26  2011-03-20
    - make tests stop relying on a specific format for anon class/role names (doy)

0.25  2011-03-04
    - Move the reinitialization hook from Role to Trait so hardcore hackers
      (trait janitors) get the benefit too (doy)

0.24  2011-03-01
    - Made MXRP more extensible by hooking into the role metaobject
      reinitialization (doy)

0.23  2010-12-25
    - Merry Christmas!
    - Make MooseX::Role::Parameterized::Extending more instructive. Hopefully.

0.21  2010-11-15
    - "package" arg can now tell generate_role to use a specific package (rjbs)

0.20  2010-11-02

    - Delegate parameterizable->has_parameter to parameters->has_attribute
      (Sartak)

0.13  2009-09-11
    - Documentation improvements (Sartak)

0.12  2009-08-15
    - Add MooseX::Role::Parameterized->current_metaclass for forward compat
      (Sartak)

    - Various documentation improvements (Sartak)

0.11  2009-08-09
    - Explicitly test-require Test::Moose for Fedora packaging (RSRCHBOY)

    - Finally a sensible synopsis (Sartak)

    - More examples are always good :) (Sartak)

0.10  2009-06-25
    - Fix test that now warns in Moose (Sartak)

0.09  2009-06-14

0.06  2009-05-12
    - Fix long-standing role-role combination bug, reported by several
      users (Sartak)

    - Documentation improvements (Sartak)

0.05  2009-04-24
    - Use replace_constructor in Meta::Parameter's make_immutable (nothingmuch)

    - The & prototype hack has been obviated by Moose::Exporter goodness (rafl)

    - List examples of MooseX::Role::Parameterized roles (Sartak)

0.04  2009-01-30
    - The role block now receives as an argument the consuming class or role.

0.03  2009-01-17
    - Parameters now default to read-only, so that you no longer have to specify
      the extremely common case of: is => 'ro'

0.02  2008-12-09
    - Using keywords outside of the role block is now allowed and handled.

    - The role generated by the role block is now composed with its parent role.
      This is so you can have unparameterized components to your parameterized
      roles, and so that does_role returns true if you ask about the parent
      role (instead of the anonymous parameterized role).
