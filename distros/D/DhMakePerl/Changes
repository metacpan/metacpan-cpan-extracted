  * Add a lintian override for latest-debian-changelog-entry-changed-to-

  * Debian::Control::FromCPAN: find_debs_for_modules(): exit version loop.
    When searching for versioned dependency, the method issues the warning
    "$module package in APT ($d) does not satisfy $dep" even when higher
    versions are available. Exit the loop as soon as we have a high enough
    version.
  * Issue a warning in build_package if local::lib usage is detected.
    local::lib sets the installation path (by default to $HOME/perl5) via
    PERL_MB_OPT/PERL_MM_OPT which is not what we want in the built
    package. Messing with the environment is a bit too brittle, so we
    issue a fat warning and give recommendations for deactivating the
    local::lib environment temporarily.

  * debian/copyright: change Copyright-Format 1.0 URL to HTTPS.
  * DhMakePerl::Utils: when checking for core modules, look at current
    perl.
    Various helpers which check if a module is in Perl core or starting from
    which version only looked at the first Perl version. This ignored cases
    where a package was removed from core at some point.

  * Apply patch from Dima Kogan, avoiding confusion when the version string is
    not quoted (RT#71224)
  * META:
    + add explicit configure_requires on Module::Build
    + add repository URL
    + add keywords
  * when warning about missing apt-file, state the minimum required version

  [ gregor herrmann ]
  * Swap order of alternative (build) dependencies after the perl 5.14
    transition.
  * DhMakePerl/Command/make.pm: setup_dir(): change back to original
    directory after CPAN.pm changes it; thanks to Dima Kogan
    (cf. RT#71708).
  * Fix POD: --pkg-perl sets Vcs-Git, of course.
  * Treat META.json like META.yml (i.e. rm/unlink/ignore it).
  * DhMakePerl::Command::Packaging: don't initialize CPAN if --no-network
    is set. Otherwise t/cache.t fails because CPAN tries to update its
    config and goes out hunting for CPAN mirrors.
  * t/dists.t: allow multiple years in Copyright line.
    "refresh" adds the current year to the years of copyright.
    In other words: This was a "New Year's Bug".
  * t/dists: fix the regexp for matching the email address of our maintainer.
  * DhMakePerl::Command::Packaging: don't initialize CPAN if --no-network is set.
  * Treat META.json like META.yml (i.e. rm/unlink/ignore it).

  * When making recursively, build/install this package only AFTER its
    dependencies have been built/installed
  * find_debs_for_modules() no longer reports installed-but-not-in-aptfile
    packages as missing
  * when installing a package, $arch now comes from the control file
    (Closes Debian bug #651343)

  * t/cache.t: New test for handling unreadable cache files.
  * Debian::WNPP::Query: return an empty hashref rather than undef after
    failing to read cache file.
  * DhMakePerl::Config: Change default source format to 3.0 (quilt).

  [ Damyan Ivanov ]
  * Packaging.pm: extend the examples regular expression to match demo/demos.
    Thanks to Kevin Ryde. Closes Debian bug #634932
  * add pristine-tar to Recommends. Thanks to Tim.
  * fix t/debian-version.t to not plan twice in case debian/changelog does not
    exist (e.g. when testing the CPAN distribution, which lacks debian/ stuff)
    RT#66214
  * setup_git_repository: streamline import of upstream sources

  [ gregor herrmann ]
  * Update created Vcs-Browser URLs for Debian Perl Group repositories.
  * Change URLs for DEP5 Format-Specification to point to
    http://anonscm.debian.org.
  * Update list of contributors/copyright holders in dh-make-perl and
    debian/copyright.

    templates.

  [ Nicholas Bamber ]
  * Updated authorship notice

  [ Damyan Ivanov ]
  * Add --vcs option, guiding VCS-* headers' creation in --pkg-perl mode. It
    also helps with the initial repository creation for Git
  * Do not die when the WNPP cache cannot be read, for example due to binary
    format change in Storable. Also, use platform-independent storage.
    Closes: #626987 - dh-make-perl: Debian::WNPP::Query does not correctly
    invalidate cache or use platform-netural Storable format
  * bump default debhelper compatibility level to 8
  * note oldstable has perl 5.10.0, not 5.8.8
  * apply a patch from Manfred Stock fixing AptContents not to miss
    alternative dependencies when a given module is found in more than one
    package. Closes: #622852
  * Use CPAN::Meta for processing META.* files, adding support for META.json.
  * When no META file is available, try parsing name and version from Build.PL
    before Makefile.PL. Closes: #589946
  * fix calls to extract_basic_copyright from File::Find::find to not chdir,
    fixing lookups for ./LICENSE, etc on refresh. Closes: #613606 -- Fails to
    correctly identify GPLv2 in RT::Authen::ExternalAuth v0.08 on refresh

  [ Nicholas Bamber ]
  Added logic to parse special email change directives in the changelog
  so that the refresh command respects email changes.
      Debian bug #609409

  Changed regular expression in t/dists.t to allow .svn not ending in /

  Various fixes for t/dists.t:
    - Added fix for .svn at the end of a filename rather than the middle
    - Second /dev/null check was attempting to diff an undefined value
    - Setting PERL5LIB (unsatisfactory work around for system(dh-make-perl) )


0.71 (2010-12-28)

  [ Ansgar Burchardt ]
  DhMakePerl::Command::Packaging: Refer to "Debian systems" instead of
  "Debian GNU/Linux systems" in generated debian/copyright.

  [ Salvatore Bonaccorso ]
  Improve regular expression to not match fields in Makefile.PL as
  MIN_PERL_VERSION to determine the version of the package. Thanks to
  Andrew Ruthven for reporting.
      Debian bug #596025

  Update my email address.

  dh --buildsystem=buildsystem needs at least debhelper (>= 7.3.7), add this
  rule to DhMakePerl::Command::Packaging.

  Bump versioned Build-Depends on debhelper to (>= 7.3.7) as needed
  for --buildsystem.

        Debian bug #525847

    spelling fixes in POD and comments

    [ Ansgar Burchardt ]
    Do not require --cpan in addition to --pkg-perl when adding Vcs-* fields.

    Debian::Dependency: Recognize deprecated '<' and '>' relations.

    Debian::Dependency: Allow architecture restrictions in dependencies.
    For now this information is just ignored.

    DhMakePerl::Command::Packaging (set_package_name): Use package name
    specified by --packagename option. (Debian bug #584619)

    dh-make-perl: Fix spelling error ("intercepring" → "intercepting").

    Debian::WNPP::Query: Fix bugs_for_package method.

    Debian::Control::FromCPAN (discover_dependencies): Do not ignore results
    from Module::Depends::Intrusive. (Debian bug #587276)

    [ Salvatore Bonaccorso ]
    Add support of Breaks field for binary package stanzas in debian/control
    to Debian::Control::Stanza::Binary.

    Create packages with Standards-Version: 3.9.1.

    Fix sentences in texts for License stanzas of debian/copyright: Add full
    stop mark after sentences.

    Add explicit Link to versioned `/usr/share/common-licenses/GPL-1' as this 
    was added by base-files 5.8 (See debian bug #436105).

    Fix debian/copyright text templates in t/dist/Strange-0.1 and
    t/dist/Strange-2.1.

    Add support for perl_dbi addon for dh.

    Build-Depends only on perl when Build.PL and Module::Build is used,
    instead of an alternate Build-Depends on perl (>= 5.10) |
    libmodule-build-perl. This is as support for Etch is now discontinued and
    Lenny already contains perl (>= 5.10) (Debian bug #590114).

    [ Chris Butler ]
    Fixed DhMakePerl::Utils to cope with modules in Module::CoreList where the
    version is unspecified. (Debian bug #585755)

0.68 (2010-05-04)

    Build.PL: add no_index as an attempt to avoid PAUSE indexing private stuff

    My::Builder: 'orig' target now creates identical (hard-linked)
        DhMakePerl-VERSION.tar.gz and dh-make-perl_VERSION.orig.tar.gz files

    My::Builder: streamline messages in the 'dist' and 'orig' actions

    Control.t: ensure dependency fields are wrapped properly

    make: fix a typo (DpkgList -> DpkgLists). Thanks to Dominic Hargreaves
        Debian bug #580101

    modules_already_packaged: fix ModuleInfo instantiation

    Config: honour values given to the constructor

    DpkgLists.t: do not insist that '/bin/perl' (or the corresponding regex) is
        only in perl-base. Instead, ensure that 'perl-base' is present in the
        returned list. Debian bug #580025

    make: drop $VERSION; some POD rewrite (was a blind copy of DhMakePerl.pm)

0.67
    POD: drop "--" in front of the commands.
    refresh: ensure ->rules is there before attempting to fiddle quilt
        integration

    Add support for version relations in META

    Debian::Dependency now survives being given a string with leading spaces

    make: implement recursive making of missing dependencies when --recursive
        is given. (Debian bug #342751)

    FromCPAN: remove leading 'v' from versions

    add Debian::DpkgLists - 'dpkg -S' on steroids

    FromCPAN: use Debian::DpkgLists as a last resort. This allows finding
        dependencies that are present in locally-installed packages.
        (Debian bug #478781)

    Dependency: the 'ver' member is an instance of Dpkg::Version
        Use its ability to compare and drop Debian::Version

    Dependenc{y,ies}: reduce '--' to '-' in the NAME POD section

    make: try harder to discover already existing package by looking up
        distribution modules in APT contents and dpkg file lists.

    replace CPAN::Config->load with CPAN:Handle::Config->load
        the former seems obsolete and only warns:
            Dispatching deprecated method 'CPAN::Config::load' to
            CPAN::HandleConfig

    added README

    added xt/pod-spelling.t to help test POD spelling
