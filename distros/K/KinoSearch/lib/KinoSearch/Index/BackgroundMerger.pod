=head1 NAME

KinoSearch::Index::BackgroundMerger - Consolidate index segments in the background.

=head1 DEPRECATED

The KinoSearch code base has been assimilated by the Apache L<Lucy> project.
The "KinoSearch" namespace has been deprecated, but development continues
under our new name at our new home: L<http://lucy.apache.org/>

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $bg_merger = KinoSearch::Index::BackgroundMerger->new(
        index  => '/path/to/index',
    );
    $bg_merger->commit;



=head1 DESCRIPTION

Adding documents to an index is usually fast, but every once in a while the
index must be compacted and an update takes substantially longer to
complete.  See L<KinoSearch::Docs::Cookbook::FastUpdates> for how to use
this class to control worst-case index update performance.

As with L<Indexer|KinoSearch::Index::Indexer>, see
L<KinoSearch::Docs::FileLocking> if your index is on a shared volume.

=head1 CONSTRUCTORS

=head2 new( I<[labeled params]> )

    my $bg_merger = KinoSearch::Index::BackgroundMerger->new(
        index   => '/path/to/index',    # required
        manager => $manager             # default: created internally
    );

Open a new BackgroundMerger.

=over

=item *

B<index> - Either a string filepath or a Folder.

=item *

B<manager> - An IndexManager.  If not supplied, an IndexManager with
a 10-second write lock timeout will be created.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 commit()

Commit any changes made to the index.  Until this is called, none of
the changes made during an indexing session are permanent.

Calls prepare_commit() implicitly if it has not already been called.

=head2 prepare_commit()

Perform the expensive setup for commit() in advance, so that commit()
completes quickly.  

Towards the end of prepare_commit(), the BackgroundMerger attempts to
re-acquire the write lock, which is then held until commit() finishes
and releases it.

=head2 optimize()

Optimize the index for search-time performance.  This may take a
while, as it can involve rewriting large amounts of data.



=head1 INHERITANCE

KinoSearch::Index::BackgroundMerger isa L<KinoSearch::Object::Obj>.
