NAME
    Module::Rename - Utility functions for renaming a module distribution

SYNOPSIS
        ########
        # Shell:
        ########
        $ module-rename Old::Name New::Name Old-Name-Distro

        #######
        # Perl:
        #######
        use Module::Rename;

        my $ren = Module::Rename->new(
            name_old           => "Old::Name",
            name_new           => "New::Name",
        );

        $ren->find_and_rename($start_dir);

DESCRIPTION
    Have you ever created a module distribution, only to realize later that
    the module hierarchary needed to be changed? All of a sudden,
    "Cool::Frobnicator" didn't sound cool anymore, but needed to be
    "Util::Frobnicator" instead?

    Going through a module's distribution, changing all package names,
    variable names, and move the directories around can be a tedious task.
    "Module::Rename" comes with a script "module-rename" which takes care of
    all this:

        $ ls
        Cool-Frobnicator-0.01/

        $ module-rename Cool::Frobnicator Util::Frobnicator Cool-Frobnicator-0.01
        Cool-Frobnicator-0.01/lib/Cool is empty and can go away.

    Done. The directory hierarchy has changed:

        $ ls -R
        Util-Frobnicator-0.01/
        ...
        Util-Frobnicator-0.01/lib/Util/Frobnicator.pm

    ... and so has the content of all files:

        $ grep "package" Util-Frobnicator-0.01/lib/Util/Frobnicator.pm
        package Util::Frobnicator;

  Things to Keep in Mind
    *   "module-rename" will rename files and replace their content, so make
        sure that you have a backup copy in case something goes horribly
        wrong.

    *   After changing the module hierarchy, some directories might be
        empty, like the "lib/Cool" directory above. In this case, a warning
        will be issued:

            Cool-Frobnicator-0.01/lib/Cool is empty and can go away.

        and the 'empty' directory gets deleted (even if a CVS subdirectory
        is in there).

API
    "my $renamer = Module::Rename->new(...)"
        The renamer's constructor takes the following parameters:

        "name_old"
            Old module name.

        "name_new"
            New module name.

        "dir_exclude"
            Reference to an array with directories to exclude from
            traversing. Preset to

                dir_exclude => ['blib']

            but can be overridden.

        "dir_ignore"
            Reference to an array with entries to be ignored in 'empty'
            directories. Even with these entries being present, a directory
            will be considered empty and swept away.

            Preset to

                    dir_ignore => ['CVS'],

            but can be overridden.

        "wipe_empty_subdirs"
            If set to a true value, 'empty' (see above) subdirectories will
            be deleted after all renaming and restructuring is done.
            Defaults to true.

    "$renamer->find_and_rename($start_dir)"
        Start searching and replacing in $start_dir and recurse into it.
