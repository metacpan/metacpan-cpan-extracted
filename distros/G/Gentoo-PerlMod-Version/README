Gentoo::PerlMod::Version

This module acts as a reference implementation of how Gentoo maps CPAN
and Perl versions, and transforms them into derived versions that are
suitable for Gentoo dependency tracking.

Perl has several primary formats of versions, the most notable one being
"float" style versions, in the form "x.yyyyyyyyyyy" where the number of
"y"'s are arbitrary, and are interpreted as a floating point value.

That is, 1.001 is NOT the same as 1.01 and 1.1

However, Gentoo's version scheme sees 1.001 similar to 1.001.000 which
is similar to 1.1.0 and thus, similar to 1.1.

Obviously this will not do, because when somebody says they need ">=1.05
(g:1.5)" expecting "1.06 (g:1.6)", but instead get "1.009 (g:1.9)",
things will break.

Hence, detection of these cases and normalizing them is essential:

  1.001 -> 1.1.0
  1.01  -> 1.10.0
  1.1   -> 1.100.0
  1.05  -> 1.50.0
  1.06  -> 1.60.0
  1.009 -> 1.9.0

  1.9.0 < 1.50.0 < 1.60.0

The simplest use of this library is with the shipped tool,
"gentoo-perlmod-version.pl"

  gentoo-perlmod-version.pl --oneshot 1.06  # 1.6.0
