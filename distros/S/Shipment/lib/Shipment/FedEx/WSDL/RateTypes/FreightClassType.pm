=head1 DESCRIPTION

Perl data type class for the XML Schema defined simpleType
FreightClassType from the namespace http://fedex.com/ws/rate/v9.

These values represent the industry-standard freight classes used for FedEx Freight and FedEx National Freight shipment description. (Note: The alphabetic prefixes are required to distinguish these values from decimal numbers on some client platforms.)

This clase is derived from 
   SOAP::WSDL::XSD::Typelib::Builtin::string
. SOAP::WSDL's schema implementation does not validate data, so you can use it exactly
like it's base type.
