NAME
    Platform - add dependencies on platforms

DESCRIPTION
    This is a documentation-only release. There is not generally any reason to
    install it.

    The `Platform::*` namespace is for releasing dummy distributions which are
    only installable on a particular platform.

    For example, Platform::Windows can only be installed on Windows machines.
    Perl software designed to run on Windows only may then introduce a
    deliberate dependency on Platform::Windows to make its platform
    requirement explicit.

  Dependencies in ExtUtils::MakeMaker
       WriteMakefile(
          ...,
          MIN_PERL_VERSION => "5.6.1",
          PREREQ_PM => {
             "Platform::Windows" => 0,
             "Some::Module"      => "1.23",
             ...,
          },
       );

  Dependencies in Module::Install
       perl_version "5.6.1";
       requires "Platform::Windows" => 0;
       requires "Some::Module"      => "1.23";

  Dependencies in Module::Build
       my $build = Module::Build->new(
          ...,
          requires => {
             "perl"              => "5.6.1",
             "Platform::Windows" => 0,
             "Some::Module"      => "1.23",
             ...,
          },
       );
