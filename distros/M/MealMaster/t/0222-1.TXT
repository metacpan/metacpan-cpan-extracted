-----------------------------SEA FOAM FROSTING-----------------------------
      2    Egg whites                        1/3 c  COCA-COLA
  1 1/2 c  (firmly packed) light               1 ts Vanilla extract
           Brown sugar                              Dash salt
    1/8 ts Cream of tartar *              
 
  *  Do not use a mix with pudding added or which requires oil.
  
  *  you may substitute 1 tablespoon corn syrup.
  
  TO MAKE THE CAKE:  In a large mixing bowl, combine the cake mix, baking
  soda, and eggs.  Measure the Coca-Cola, stir briskly until the foaming
  stops; add to the batter.  Blend ingredients just until moistened, then
  beat at high speed of an electric mixer for 3 minutes, scraping the bowl
  often.
  
  In a bowl, combine the mashed bananas with the lemon juice; add to the
  batter.  Add the chopped nuts to the batter and beat for 1 minute at medium
  speed.  Turn the batter into a well-greased, lightly floured, 13x9x2-inch
  pan.
  
  Bake in a preheated, 350 degree F oven for about 40 minutes or until the
  cake tests done.  Cool on a rack for 15 minutes, remove cake from pan and
  turn right-side up on a rack to finish cooling.
  
  TO MAKE THE SEA FOAM FROSTING:  In the top of a double boiler, combine all
  the ingredients except the vanilla extract.  Beat 1 minute at high speed of
  an electric mixer.  Place over boiling water (the water should not touch
  the bottom of the top half of the double boiler.). Beat on high speed about
  7 minutes until the frosting forms peaks when the mixer is raised.
  
  Remove from boiling water (for the smoothest frosting, empty into a large
  bowl).  Add the vanilla extract and continue beating on high speed until
  thick enough to spread, about 2 minutes.  Spread on the sides and top of
  the cold banana cake.

  and lemon zest. Sift together cake flour, 3/4 cup sugar and baking powder

  9-inch indented, fluted shortcake pan sprayed with non-stick vegetable
  spray. Bake at 375 degrees F. about 20 minutes or until cake tests done in
  the center. Let cool in pan 5 minutes. Loosen edges and turn out onto wire
  rack with wax paper underneath. Combine remaining 1/4 cup sugar and lemon
  juice in small sauce pan. Heat to boiling. Simmer about 1 minute or until
  syrup is clear. Brush syrup over top and sides of cake while cake is still
  warm. Place cake on serving platter. Arrange raspberries, kiwi wedges and
  papaya balls in attractive arrangement on top of cake. Garnish center with

    3/4 ts Baking powder                     3/4 c  Chopped bitttersweet
    1/2 ts Salt                                     Chocolate
  1 1/2 c  Quick-cooking oats                1/3 c  Toasted walnuts, optional

      2    Egg whites                     
 
  Raisin Puree is the basis for the dough of this rich-tasting, chewy bar.
  The combination of orange and chocolate is a classic favorite. We
  considered cutting the amount of chocolate in the recipe, thereby cut- ting
  the fat, but in the end we agreed that the extra richness is worth the
  extra grams of fat. (By Times Food Stylists) Sift together flour, baking
  powder and salt into large bowl. Stir in oats and brown sugar. Beat egg
  whites lightly in another bowl. Stir in Raisin Puree. Stir into flour
  mixture along with chocolate, walnuts, and orange zest just until blended.
  Spoon in 9-inch-square baking pan sprayed with non-stick vegetable spray.
  Bake at 350 degrees F. 25 to 30 minutes. Cool. Cut into 24 bars. 213

      2    Jars (4-ounce) sweet            1 1/3 c  Sugar
           Potato baby food puree              1 ts Baking soda

    1/2 c  Thawed frozen egg                   1 ts Ground cinnamon
 
  Sweet potato puree provides the moistness in these individual non- fat
  cakes.  Mini-bundt pans, each containing 6-bundt shaped cups, are available
  in many cookware stores.  (By Times Food Stylists) Remove peel from oranges
  in large strips. Remove any white pith on orange. Finely chop peel in food

      Title: Anise Meringue Kisses
 Categories: Cookies
   Servings: 48
 
      3    Egg whites                        1/2 c  Sugar
    1/8 ts Cream of tartar                 1 1/2 ts Ground anise seeds
 
  The flavor of anise in these light cookies makes them a great after- dinner
  dessert. Some people prefer the center to be soft and chewy, but if you
  prefer the dry melt-in-your-mouth type of meringue, turn off the oven and,
  with the door closed, let them stand 30 minutes to an hour. These cookies
  are generally baked on parchment paper, but we have found that regular bond
  paper makes a very acceptable substitute. (By Times Food Stylists) Beat egg
  whites until frothy. Add cream of tartar and beat to soft peaks. Gradually
  beat in sugar. Continue beating until stiff and glossy. Beat in anise.
  Using pastry bag, pipe onto parchment-lined baking sheets. Bake at 275
  degrees F. 30 minutes. Makes about 4 dozen kisses. NOTE: If drier meringue
  is desired, turn off oven and let kisses stand in oven with door closed
  about 1 hour. Each kiss contains about: 9 calories; 4 mg sodium; 0

      1    (8-ounce) carton frozen             1 ts Ground cinnamon

----------------------------LOW-FAT SWEET PASTRY----------------------------
    1/2 c  Plus 2 tablespoons oat flour      1/2 ts Ground cardamom or cinnamon

      5 tb All-purpose flour                   3 ts Cold butter, diced
    1/4 c  Cake flour                          1 tb Canola oil
 
  2-2 1/2 tb very cold water The low-calorie rice pudding flan is so
  delicious by itself that you may want to save the calories and fat in the
  crust, and serve it without the pastry. Bring nonfat milk to boil in medium
  saucepan. Add vanilla bean and rice. Cover partially and simmer until rice
  is almost tender, about 20 to 30 minutes, stirring occasionally. Stir in
  sugar and continue and continue cooking 3 minutes. Remove from heat and
  cool slightly. Remove vanilla bean. Blend egg substitute with ricotta
  cheese. Stir into rice mixture with candied ginger. Carefully pour into
  prepared pastry shell, filling almost to the top (if there is any flan
  mixture left from incomplete reduction in cooking, place in small custard
  dish, cover and microwave 40 to 60 seconds or until set.) Sprinkle with 1/4
  teaspoon cinnamon. Bake at 400 degrees F. 25 to 30 minutes or until set.
  Remove from oven. Sift powdered sugar over and sprinkle with remaining
  cinnamon. Serve warm and garnish with sliced ginger if desired. Makes 12
  servings. Each serving contains about: 183 calories; 102 mg sodium; 11 mg
  cholesterol; 4 grams fat; 31 grams carbohydrates; 6 grams protein; 0.25
  gram fiber. The use of oat flour blend and cake flour is what gives this
  low-fat crust its tenderness. It also makes it more difficult to roll, but
  don't despair: The dough is easily patched. Low-Fat Sweet Pastry Sift
  flour, cardamom and sugar into large bowl. Rub in butter with fingers or
  cut in with pastry blender until size of small peas. Using fork, stir in
  oil. Slowly add cold water, 1 teaspoon at a time, tossing with fork until
  flour is moistened without being wet. Gather dough with moist hands, shape
  into flattened round and let rest about 15 minutes. Roll 1/8-inch thick on
  lightly floures board. (To facilitate rolling, dough may also be rolled
  between sheets of wax paper Or unrolled dough may be placed in pan and
  gently pressed  to cover inside of pan.) Gently lift and press onto 9-inch
  square tart pan with removable bottom. Cut off dough edges. Bake at 425
  degrees F. 10 to 15 minutes or until golden brown. Makes 12 servings. NOTE:
  Unsalted butter will give a more delicate fresh flavor in this pastry. Add
  a dash of salt if using.
