The Geo::WeatherNWS module is used to get the latest METAR encoded 
observations from the National Weather Service and decode them to a 
perl-friendly format.  The jump to version 1.01 was made because I
decided to lock the interface down from the 0.23 version.  There are
also some minor bug fixes in the remarks section.

The documentation on how to use the module is available via perldoc.

Requirements:

	Net::FTP
	IO::Handle
	Carp

Install this module in the normal way:

        perl Makefile.PL
        make
        make test
        make install

Todo:
	- Adding experimental tie-in to GD::Graph
	- Adding experimental 12-24 hour forecast system
	  (this might be somewhat specific to North America,
	  unless I can find a good way to set the rules for 
	  the forecast)
