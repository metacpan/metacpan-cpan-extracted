0.04 2003-03-20
  - Changed several tests in unit.t to use RE matches instead of exact
    numerical equality for floating point numbers.  This should fix the
    failures that I got from some of the Perl testers on other
    platforms.
  - Took out "print 'Howdy!'" from Unit.pm:  ooops!  I had put that
    in there to make sure that when developing, I was using the correct
    copy of the module.
  - Removed the example script MultiTypes.pl.  It didn't really do
    anything unique.
  - Simplified eg/UnitSimple.pl, and moved some of its test code into
    t/unit.t.
  - Created eg/UnitDebug.pl, which turns on debugging when given the
    '-d' command-line option.  I took this feature out of UnitSimple.pl,
    in order to make the latter as simple as possible.
  - Similarly, I created eg/VectorDebug.pl, and simplified
    eg/VectorSimple.pl.
  - Ditto for eg/ScalarDebug.pl and eg/ScalarSimple.pl.
  - Fixed eg/ScalarMethods.pl - changed "lb" to "lbm" in the mass.
  - Added lots of tests to t/scalar.t:  everything that was in
    eg/ScalarMethods.pl and eg/ScalarSimple.pl.
  - I took all the test statements out of the examples:  things like
    "die if ...".  This cleans up the examples.  Wherever it made sense,
    I moved those tests into the test scripts, and converted them to use
    the Test::More functions.
  - Added an example of automagic determination of a scalar type to the
    Scalar.pm documentation.
  - I fixed the automatic generation of scalar type.  This example from
    the Scalar.pm documentation:
      $d = new Physics::Unit::Scalar('3m');
    now correctly produces a Physics::Unit::Distance object.
  - That resulted in the VectorSimple.pl example script working now.
  - Changed the header of one of the sections in the Scalar.pm
    documentation from "IMPLEMENTATION NOTES" to "UNITS ASSOCIATED
    WITH SCALARS".
  - Added UnitsByName.html and UnitsByType.html to the MANIFEST.  These
    are generated automagically by the UnitGenDoc.pl example script.

  - Added the prefixes "semi" and "demi", for 0.5.
  - Added the binary prefixes; see
    http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/binary.html
  - Added 'revolution', 'revolutions', and 'rpm'.
  - Added 'cycle' and 'cycles'.
  - Added 'degrees-rankine'
  - Removed some old code that was commented out.
  - Moved implementation-specific comments, including private method
    documentation, into UnitImpl.pm.
  - Added the "EXPRESSION GRAMMAR" section to Unit.pm.
  - Moved documentation about Scalar.pm private methods into
    ScalarImpl.pm.

  - Added "pica" and "point" units to Unit.pm
  - Also added "stone" and "stones"
  - Also added jeweler's units 'carat', 'carats', 'karat', 'karats',
    and 'j-point'.
  - Added a section to the Unit.pm documentation:  "Naming Conflicts
    and Resolution".  This describes all of the instances of units
    names that have multiple definitions (e.g. "point") and how each
    is resolved in this library.
  - Improved the documentation of the unit expression grammar.
  - Re-organized, slightly, the documentation of private methods in the
    Unit.pm module.
  - Re-organized, slightly, the documentation in the Scalar.pm module.
  - Changed *all* the files' newline format from DOS to Unix.
  - Updated the README file.

  - Unit.pm Documentation
    - Removed the "COMPILE-TIME STUFF" header and the associated
      paragraph.
    - InitBaseUnit() is showing up both under "Class Data" and
      "Public Utility Functions".  I removed it from the former.
    - Ditto for InitPrefix(), InitTypes(), InitUnit(), and
      GetUnit().  Gene:  was there some reason that I'm not seeing for
      including these under "Class Data"?
    - Added some of the grammar back into the documentation for the
      Parser methods.

  - Scalar.pm Documentation
    - I added the header "IMPLEMENTATION NOTES" two paragraphs after
      the "DEBUG OPTION" header, since the following paragraphs there
      aren't related to the debug option.
    - I took the ScalarFactory() function out of "PUBLIC METHODS", and
      put it under "PUBLIC UTILITY FUNCTIONS" (a new heading).0.04 2003-03-21
