CopyTree-VendorProof-LocalFileOp version 0.0013
===============================

This module provides a new [sic.] contructor and necessary subclass methods for CopyTree::VendorProof in order to deal with local file operations.

The subclass methods provided in this connector objects include:
	new
	fdls				
	is_fd
	read_info_memory
	write_from_memory
	copy_local_files
	cust_mkdir
	cust_rmdir
	cust_rmfile

The functionality of these methods are descripbed in 
perldoc CopyTree::VendorProof

Under the section "Object specific instance methods for the base class CopyTree::VendorProof"

To create a LocalFileOp connector instance:
	my $lcfo_inst = CopyTree::VendorProof::LocalFileOp ->new;

To add a source or destination item to a CopyTree::VendorProof instance:
	my $ctvp_inst = CopyTree::VendorProof ->new;
	$ctvp_inst ->src ('some_source_path_of_local_file_system', $lcfo_inst);
	$ctvp_inst ->dst ('some_destination_path_of_local_file_system', $lcfo_inst);
	$ctvp_inst ->cp;

Therefore, CopyTree::VendorProof::LocalFileOp simply provides an instance and methods for its parent class, which does the heavy lifting portion of cp -rf.
