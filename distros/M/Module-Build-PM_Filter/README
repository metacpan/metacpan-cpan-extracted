Module-Build-PM_Filter

DESCRIPTION 

This module provides a Module::Build compatible class and adds a filter for
.pm, .pl and script files. The filter could be used to replace Perl source
from development environment to production, or to remove debug sentences.

In the debug phase we can play with the application and modules without
mattering to us where the library are; when we build the package for
distribution, the modules and the scripts will contain the correct path in the
final location.

In addition the module makes sure that the archives pm_filter and debian/rules
are copied in the distribution directory with the suitable permissions.

SYNOPSIS

In a Build.PL file you must use this module in place of the L<Module::Build>:

    use Module::Build::PM_Filter;

    my $build = Module::Build::PM_Filter->new(
                module_name         =>  'MyIkiWiki::Tools',
                license             =>  q(gpl),
                dist_version        =>  '0.2',
                dist_author         =>  'Víctor Moral <victor@taquiones.net>',
                );

    $build->create_build_script();

In the package directory build a pm_filter file like this:

    #!/usr/bin/perl -pl

    s{##PACKAGE_LIB##}{use lib qw(/usr/share/myprogram);}g;

and change its permissions for user execution.

Then in a script from package insert a line like this:

    package MyPackage;
    use strict;
    use base;
    ...

    ##PACKAGE_LIB##

    ...
