        - Objects that use the New attribute can now be subclassed.
        - More tests. 386 now :)
        - Fixed Want.pm test.

1.04  Mon Apr 21 17:54:12 2003
        - Want.pm is no longer required, so the module can be used by people
          that can't compile XS modules. If it is installed, it will be used,
          but if it's not, it'll simply fall back to something that does work.
