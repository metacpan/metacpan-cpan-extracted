NAME
    MooseX::ArrayRef - blessed arrayrefs with Moose

SYNOPSIS
      {
        package Local::Person;
        use Moose;
        has name => (
          is    => 'ro',
          isa   => 'Str',
        );
        __PACKAGE__->meta->make_immutable;
      }
  
      {
        package Local::Marriage;
        use MooseX::ArrayRef;
        has husband => (
          is    => 'ro',
          isa   => 'Local::Person',
        );
        has wife => (
          is    => 'ro',
          isa   => 'Local::Person',
        );
        __PACKAGE__->meta->make_immutable;
      }
  
      my $marriage = Local::Marriage->new(
        wife      => Local::Person->new(name => 'Alex'),
        husband   => Local::Person->new(name => 'Sam'),
      );
  
      use Data::Dumper;
      use Scalar::Util qw(reftype);
      print reftype($marriage), "\n";   # 'ARRAY'
      print Dumper($marriage);

DESCRIPTION
    Objects implemented with arrayrefs rather than hashrefs are often faster
    than those implemented with hashrefs. Moose's default object
    implementation is hashref based. Can we go faster?

    Simply `use MooseX::ArrayRef` instead of `use Moose`, but note the
    limitations in the section below.

    The current implementation is mostly a proof of concept, but it does
    mostly seem to work.

BUGS AND LIMITATIONS
  Limitations on Speed
    The accessors for mutable classes not significantly faster than Moose's
    traditional hashref-based objects. For immutable classes, the speed up is
    bigger

  Limitations on Mutability
    Things will probably break if you try to modify classes, add roles, etc
    "on the fly". Make your classes immutable before instantiating even a
    single object.

  Limitations on Inheritance
    Inheritance isn't easy to implement with arrayrefs. The current
    implementation suffers from the following limitations:

    *   Single inheritance only.

        You cannot extend multiple parent classes.

    *   Inherit from other MooseX::ArrayRef classes only.

        A MooseX::ArrayRef class cannot extend a non-MooseX::ArrayRef class.
        Even non-Moose classes which are implemented using arrayrefs. (Of
        course, all Moose classes inherit from Moose::Object too, which is
        just fine.)

    Note that delegation (via Moose's `handles`) is often a good alternative
    to inheritance.
