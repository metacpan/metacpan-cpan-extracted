This describes version 0.24 of Module::DevAid.


==== DESCRIPTION ====

Module (and script) to aid with development, by helping (and testing)
auto-building of certain files, and with the steps needed in building and
committing a release.

a project config file, which defaults to 'mod_devaid.conf' in the current
directory.

Features:

*   generates a TODO file from a devtodo .todo file

*   auto-updates a Changes file from the revision-control system's change
    log.

*   auto-changes version-id in module and script files

*   does all of the above and tags commits for a release
