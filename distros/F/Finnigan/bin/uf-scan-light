=head1 NAME

uf-scan-light - list the profile or centroids in a single MS scan

=head1 SYNOPSIS

uf-scan-light [options] file

 Options:

  -l[ist]                            list the called peaks [required]
  -p[rofile]                         print the scan profile as a 2-column table [required]
  -b[ookends] <n:+i>		     add <n> empty bins on both sides of each profile chunk [requires: -p]
  -n[umber] <n:+i>                   select scan number <n> [required]
  -mz                                list just the M/z values
  <file>                             input file [required]

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<-help>

Print a brief help message and exits.

=item B<-l[ist]>

Get the peak list from the scan number B<-n>, if they are available. If the called peaks are not present, B<uf-scan-light> will print a message to that effect and exit.

=item B<-p[rofile]>

Prints the scan profile for scan number B<-n>, if it is available. If the profile is not present, B<uf-scan-light> will print a message to that effect and exit.

=item B<-n[umber]>

Gives the number of a single scan to process

=item B<-b[ookends]>

Sets the number of empty bins to add prepend and append to each profile chunk. Doing so can enhance the appearance of peak shapes rendered on simple plots when the profiles are filtered. Threshold filtering removes the bases of detected peaks as well, so this is a primitive way of reconstructing them.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<uf-scan-light> can be used to list the scan data for a single scan. Unlike L<uf-scan>, it is based on a lightweight version of scan data decoder, L<Finnigan::Scan>, which does not preserve the location and type data of decoded elements and therefore cannot generate detailed data dumps. But there is one thing B<uf-scan-light> does that L<uf-scan> does not: it mimics the manner in which Thermo-derived tools assign bin values in profile mode and it can insert stretches of empty bins on both sides of each profile peak, in the same way as they do it. Setting the value of the B<-bookends> option to B<4> results in the same output as that of readw or msconvert.

Also, B<uf-scan-light> does not output the raw profiles. It automatically converts frequency values to M/z.

The B<-profile> option instructs B<uf-scan-light> to print the profile data. The B<-list> option lists the peaks.

Options B<-profile> and B<-list> are mutually exclusive.

To convert the raw scan data into M/z values, use the B<-v> option.

Option B<-bookends> adds the specified number of empty bins to each side of a profile chunk. If the gap is smaller than 2x the number of bookend bins, it is completely zeroed out.

=head1 EXAMPLES

=over 4

=item Print converted profile bins (M/z values) in the 1st scan:

 uf-scan-light -p -n 1 sample.raw

=item Print converted  profile bins in the 1st scan and add four-bin 'bookends' to make the output look like Thermo's:

 uf-scan-light -p -n 1 -b 4 sample.raw

=item Print the list of centroids in the 1st scan:

 uf-scan-light -l -n 1 sample.raw

Note that B<uf-scan-lightq> does not calculate the peak centroids from the
profile; it only lists the existing centroids if they are present.
