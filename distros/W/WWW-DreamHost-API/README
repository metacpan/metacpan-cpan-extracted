NAME
    WWW::DreamHost::API - Perl interface to DreamHost Web Panel API

VERSION
    1.07

SYNOPSIS
     my $key = '6SHU5P2HLDAYECUM';
     my $api = new WWW::DreamHost::API($key);
     my $res = $api->command('api-list_accessible_cmds');
     print Data::Dumper->Dump([$res]);

DESCRIPTION
    WWW::DreamHost::API provides a simple Perl interface to DreamHost Web
    Panel API.

    Read more about API commands at
    <http://wiki.dreamhost.com/Application_programming_interface>

METHODS
  new ( $key )
    Creates WWW::DreamHost::API object

  uuid ( )
    Returns UUID. Probably actually unique (randomly based on key and run
    time). Don't worry, if it's not, because it's reinitializing in case of
    failure (though I cannot imagine how it can happen).

  reinit ( )
    If unique check fails, attempt to re-initialize. You don't have to call
    it yourself.

  command ( $cmd, [ $param => $value, ]+ )
    Execute a command.

    To get a list of availible commands, use something like that:

        my $res = $api->command('api-list_accessible_cmds');
        if ($res->{'result'} eq 'success') {
            my @commands = @{ $res->{'data'} };
        }

    Returns a hash reference with (usually) 'result' and 'data' keys.
    'result' can be 'success' or 'error', and 'data' depends on command
    executed.

    See <http://wiki.dreamhost.com/Application_programming_interface> for
    more details.

CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT
    WWW::DreamHost::API is based on *libwww-perl* which uses *Crypt::SSLeay*
    or *IO::Socket::SSL*, with all consequences: HTTPS_proxy environment
    variable and so on. See *LWP* documentation unless you're already
    familiar with it.

DEPENDENCIES
    LWP::UserAgent Data::UUID LWP::protocol::https

    If JSON.pm is installed, JSON format is used when making requests to
    API; otherwise Data::Dumper format is used. Note that Data::Dumper
    format is "eval"-ed so (in theory) it can be used for security breach.
    On the side note, Data::Dumper way is 7 times faster.

INCOMPATIBILITIES
    Not known.

BUGS AND LIMITATIONS
    Not known, but test suite MAY fail if DreamHost adds some other commands
    or change their behaviour. If you are using CPAN::Reporter in your
    service, I'll know about it. Consider installing it, as it really helps
    authors to know about possible bugs. See
    <http://wiki.cpantesters.org/wiki/QuickStart>.
