NAME
    Path::Resolve - node.js path module in perl

SYNOPSIS
        use Path::Resolve;
    
        my $path = Path::Resolve->new();
    
        my $file = $path->resolve('./r/p/../file.txt');
        my $ext  = $path->extname($file);

DESCRIPTION
    This module behaves exactly like node.js path module
    <https://nodejs.org/api/path.html>, it doesn't check for path validity,
    it only works on strings and has utilities to resolve and normalize path
    strings.

    If you're looking for system specific path module that can create,
    check, chmod, copy ... etc. then take a look at Path::Tiny
