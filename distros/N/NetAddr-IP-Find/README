NAME
    NetAddr::IP::Find - Find IP addresses in plain text

SYNOPSIS
      use NetAddr::IP::Find;
      $num_found = find_ipaddrs($text, \&callback);

DESCRIPTION
    This is a module for finding IP addresses in plain text.

  Functions

    NetAddr::IP::Find exports one function, find_ipaddrs(). It works very
    similar to URI::Find's find_uris() or Email::Find's find_emails().

      $num_ipaddrs_found = find_ipaddrs($text, \&callback);

    The first argument is a text to search through and manipulate. Second is
    a callback routine which defines what to do with each IP address as
    they're found. It returns the total number of IP addresses found.

    The callback is given two arguments. The first is a NetAddr::IP instance
    representing the IP address found. The second is the actual IP address
    as found in the text. Whatever the callback returns will replace the
    original text.

EXAMPLES
      # For each IP address found, ping its host to see if its alive.
      use Net::Ping;
      my $pinger = Net::Ping->new;
      my %pinged;
      find_ipaddrs($text, sub {
                       my($ipaddr, $orig) = @_;
                       my $host = $ipaddr->to_string;
                       next if exists $pinged{$host};
                       $pinged{$host} = $pinger->ping($host);
                   });

      while (my($host, $up) == each %pinged) {
          print "$host is " . $up ? 'up' : 'down' . "\n";
      }

      # Resolve IP address to FQDN
      find_ipaddrs($text, sub {
                       my($ipaddr, $orig) = @_;
                       resolve_ip($ipaddr->to_string);
                   });

      sub resolve_ip {
          use Net::DNS;
          # see perldoc Net::DNS for details
      }

TODO
    *   Subnet support.

    *   IPv6 support.
