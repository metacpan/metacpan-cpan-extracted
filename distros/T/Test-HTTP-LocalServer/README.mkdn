# NAME

Test::HTTP::LocalServer - spawn a local HTTP server for testing

# SYNOPSIS

    use LWP::Simple qw(get);
    my $server = Test::HTTP::LocalServer->spawn;

    get $server->url, "Retrieve " . $server->url;

    $server->stop;

# DESCRIPTION

This module implements a tiny web server suitable for running "live" tests
of HTTP clients against it. It also takes care of cleaning `%ENV` from settings
that influence the use of a local proxy etc.

Use this web server if you write an HTTP client and want to exercise its
behaviour in your test suite without talking to the outside world.

# METHODS

## `Test::HTTP::LocalServer->spawn %ARGS`

    my $server = Test::HTTP::LocalServer->spawn;

This spawns a new HTTP server. The server will stay running until
  $server->stop
is called.

Valid arguments are :

- `html =>` scalar containing the page to be served
- `file =>` filename containing the page to be served
- `debug => 1` to make the spawned server output debug information
- `eval =>` string that will get evaluated per request in the server

    Try to avoid characters that are special to the shell, especially quotes.
    A good idea for a slow server would be

        eval => sleep+10

All served HTML will have the first %s replaced by the current location.

The following entries will be removed from `%ENV`:

    HTTP_PROXY
    http_proxy
    CGI_HTTP_PROXY

## `$server->port`

This returns the port of the current server. As new instances
will most likely run under a different port, this is convenient
if you need to compare results from two runs.

## `$server->url`

This returns the url where you can contact the server. This url
is valid until the `$server` goes out of scope or you call
  $server->stop;

## `$server->stop`

This stops the server process by requesting a special
url.

## `$server->kill`

This kills the server process via `kill`. The log
cannot be retrieved then.

## `$server->get_log`

This returns the
output of the server process. This output will be a list of
all requests made to the server concatenated together
as a string.

## `$server->local`

    my $url = $server->local('foo.html');
    # file:///.../foo.html

Returns an URL for a local file which will be read and served
by the webserver. The filename must
be a relative filename relative to the location of the current
program.

# URLs implemented by the server

## 302 redirect `$server->redirect($target)`

This URL will issue a redirect to `$target`. No special care is taken
towards URL-decoding `$target` as not to complicate the server code.
You need to be wary about issuing requests with escaped URL parameters.

## 404 error `$server->error_notfound($target)`

This URL will response with status code 404.

## Timeout `$server->error_timeout($seconds)`

This URL will send a 599 error after `$seconds` seconds.

## Timeout+close `$server->error_close($seconds)`

This URL will send nothing and close the connection after `$seconds` seconds.

## Error in response content `$server->error_after_headers`

This URL will send headers for a successful response but will close the
socket with an error after 2 blocks of 16 spaces have been sent.

## Chunked response `$server->chunked`

This URL will return 5 blocks of 16 spaces at a rate of one block per second
in a chunked response.

## Other URLs

All other URLs will echo back the cookies and query parameters.
