NAME
    XML::LibXML::Debugging - get debugging information from XML::LibXML nodes

SYNOPSIS
      use XML::LibXML::Debugging;

      my $parser = XML::LibXML->new;
      my $doc    = $parser->parse_file('input.xml');
      print $doc->toClarkML;

DESCRIPTION
    This module adds a couple of additional methods to XML::LibXML::Node
    objects which are mostly aimed at helping figure out what's going on with
    the DOM's namespaces and structure. `toClarkML` produces a string of
    XML-like markup with explicit namespaces. The following XML:

      <foo xmlns="http://example.com/1"
           xmlns:bar="http://example.com/2"
           bar:baz="quux" />

    Might be represented as:

      <{http://example.com/1}foo
           {http://www.w3.org/2000/xmlns/}xmlns="http://example.com/1"
           {http://www.w3.org/2000/xmlns/}bar="http://example.com/2"
           {http://example.com/2}baz="quux" />

    Another method `toDebuggingHash` returns a hashref suitable for dumping
    using Data::Dumper.
