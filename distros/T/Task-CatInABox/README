NAME
    Task::CatInABox - Catalyst and related modules for exploring Catalyst

DESCRIPTION
    This distribution defined a set of modules to cover common modules used
    in Catalyst applications.

    This package is used by Perl::Dist::CatInABox to produce a standalone
    Catalyst installer for Win32, but is made available seperately so that
    others can update their installations to match the same module set.

    The "Catalyst in a Box" module collection is curated by Kieren Diment
    <zarquon@cpan.org>, please contact him regarding the list of modules and
    to request additions.
