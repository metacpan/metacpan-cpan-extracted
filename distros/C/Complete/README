NAME
    Complete - Convention for Complete::* modules family

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.201 of Complete (from Perl
    distribution Complete), released on 2019-06-26.

DESCRIPTION
    The namespace "Complete::" is used for the family of modules that deal
    with completion (including, but not limited to, shell tab completion,
    tab completion feature in other CLI-based application, web autocomplete,
    completion in GUI, etc). This (family of) modules try to have a clear
    separation between general completion routine and shell-/environment
    specific ones, for more reusability.

    This POD page establishes convention and gives an overview of the
    modules in "Complete::*".

  Modules
   Common/shared settings and other stuffs
    Complete::Common

   Generic (non-environment-specific) modules
    Modules usually are named after the type of completion answer they
    provide. For example: Complete::Unix completes username/group name,
    Complete::Getopt::Long completes from Getopt::Long specification,
    Complete::Module completes Perl module names, and so on. A current
    exception is Complete::Util which contains several generic routines, the
    main one is "complete_array_elem()" which is used by most other
    completion routines.

   Environment-specific modules
    "Complete::Bash::*" modules are specific to bash shell. See
    Complete::Bash on some of the ways to do bash tab completion with Perl.
    Other shells are also supported. For shell-specific information, please
    refer to Complete::Zsh, Complete::Tcsh, Complete::Fish, as well as their
    submodules.

    "Complete::*" modules for non-shell environment (like browser or GUI)
    have not been developed. Please check again from time to time in the
    future.

  "complete_*()" functions
    The main functions that do the actual completion are the "complete_*()"
    functions. These functions are generic completion routines: they accept
    the word to be completed, zero or more other arguments, and return a
    completion answer structure (see "Completion answer structure").

     use Complete::Util qw(complete_array_elem);
     my $ary = complete_array_elem(array=>[qw/apple apricot banana/], word=>'ap');
     # -> ['apple', 'apricot']

    Convention for "complete_*" function:

    *   Accept a hash argument

        Example:

         complete_array_elem(%args)

        Required arguments: "word" (the word to be completed). Sometimes,
        for lower-level functions, you can accept "words" and "cword"
        instead of "word", For example, in function
        "Complete::Getopt::Long::complete_cli_arg".

        You can define more arguments as you see fit. Often there is at
        least one argument to specify or customize the source of completion,
        for example for the function "Complete::Util::complete_array_elem"
        there is an "array" argument to specify the source array.

    *   Observe settings specified in Complete::Common

        Example settings in Complete::Common include whether search should
        be case-insensitive, whether fuzzy searching should be done, etc.
        See the module's documentation for more details.

    *   Return completion answer structure

        See "Completion answer structure".

  Completion answer structure
    "complete_*()" functions return completion answer structure. Completion
    answer contains the completion entries as well as extra metadata to give
    hints to formatters/tools. It is a hashref which can contain the
    following keys:

    *   message => string

        Experimental. Instead of returning completion entries, a completion
        answer can also opt to request showing a message (i.e. error
        message, or informational message) to the user.

    *   words => array

        Its value is an array of completion entries. A completion entry can
        be a string or a hashref. Example:

         ['apple', 'apricot'] # array of strings

         [{word=>'apple', summary=>'A delicious fruit with thousands of varieties'},
          {word=>'apricot', summary=>'Another delicious fruit'},] # array of hashes

        As you can see from the above, each entry specify the word and can
        also contain additional information: summary (str, short one-line
        description, can be displayed e.g. in shells that support them, like
        fish and zsh), is_partial (bool, specify whether this is a partial
        completion).

         # example of digit-by-digit completion
         [
           {word=>'11', is_partial=>1},
           {word=>'12', is_partial=>1},
           ...
           {word=>'19', is_partial=>1},
         ],

    *   is_partial => bool

        If set to true, specifies that the entries in words are partial
        completion entries. This is equivalent to setting "is_partial => 1"
        to all the entries.

    *   type => str

        See Complete::Bash.

    *   path_sep => str

        See Complete::Bash.

    *   esc_mode => str

        See Complete::Bash.

    *   static => bool

        Specify that completion is "static", meaning that it does not depend
        on external state (like filesystem) or a custom code which can
        return different answer everytime completion is requested.

        This can be useful for code that wants to generate completion code,
        like bash completion or fish completion. Knowing that completion for
        an option value is static means that completion for that option can
        be answered from an array instead of having to call code/program
        (faster).

    As a shortcut, completion answer can also be an arrayref (just the
    "words") without any metadata.

    Examples:

     # hash form
     {words=>[qw/apple apricot/]}

     # another hash form. type=env instructs formatter not to escape '$'
     {words=>[qw/$HOME $ENV/], type=>'env'}

     # array form
     ['apple', 'apricot']

     # another array form, each entry is a hashref to include description
     [{word=>'apple', summary=>'A delicious fruit with thousands of varieties'},
      {word=>'apricot', summary=>'Another delicious fruit'},] # array of hashes
