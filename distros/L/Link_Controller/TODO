build-schedule should be merged into extract-links.

check that all systems handle file overloads.
	close should always be checked for return
	
handle relative link substitution in the CGIs.  Test relative link
substitutions alot more.

handle exclusion regular expressions in the infostructure definition.

handle fragments with characters that would otherwise be illegal.

add an option --ignore-system-config to all commands and implement it
into ReadConf so that we are more safe from the system configurtion
during testing.

update the example so it really works.  

tests for verify-link-control

test cases where we don't have correctly defined configuration variables

test that mailto urls come with unsupported protocol

perl -e 'use HTTP::Response; $a=bless( {"_method" => "HEAD","_headers" => bless( {"user-agent" => "LinkController/0.0","from" => "mikedlr\@scotclimb.org.uk"}, "HTTP::Headers" ),"_uri" => bless( [bless( do{\\(my $o = "mailto:dwb\@st-and.ac.uk")}, "URI::mailto" ),undef], "URI::URL" ),"_content" => ""}, "HTTP::Request" ),"_headers" => bless( {"client-date" => "Thu, 11 Oct 2001 21:58:12 GMT"}, "HTTP::Headers" ),"_rc" => 400,"_msg" => "Library does not allow method HEAD for \\"mailto:\\" URLs","_content" => ""}, "HTTP::Response"; print $a->as_string()' 

[bless( {'_request' => bless( {'_method' => 'HEAD','_headers' => bless( {'user-agent' => 'LinkController/0.0','from' => 'mikedlr@scotclimb.org.uk'}, 'HTTP::Headers' ),'_uri' => bless( [bless( do{\\(my $o = 'mailto:dwb@st-and.ac.uk')}, 'URI::mailto' ),undef], 'URI::URL' ),'_content' => ''}, 'HTTP::Request' ),'_headers' => bless( {'client-date' => 'Thu, 11 Oct 2001 21:58:12 GMT'}, 'HTTP::Headers' ),'_rc' => 400,'_msg' => 'Library does not allow method HEAD for \\'mailto:\\' URLs','_content' => ''}, 'HTTP::Response' ),1002837492,undef]

we need to remember the titles of pages for use in searching out 
replacements 

handle correctly cannonicalised URLs.  

	- verify that if we cannonicalise URLs before checking then we
	  still get correct results
	- if so, then all links should be cannonicalised as they are read 
	  into the system.
	- fix all substitutions during link repairing so that they fix
	  all possible versions of the link.

robot rules for all protocols

We need to do transactions of some kind in order to allow us to have
more than one process at a time.  The transactions should be designed
so that any report can happen very quickly whilst testers lock
eachother out of the records of the database.  Currently we only do
write locking of the database.

consider robot rules equivalent for non http protocols.

teach HEAD requests to work for more protocols

news protocols - connect to local news server?  
 Verify against news control messages?

mailto - connect to remote server? perhaps only check for existence of
 the MX record.  The problem here is that many mail servers lie about
 the existence of users they know about to avoid getting junkmail and
 others are simply relays that relay anything we ask them to, then
 validity is checked elsewhere.  Definitely we don't want to send a
 mail unless there is an agreed auto-responder on the other end.

ldap / radius / telnet etc..  connect to the appropriate port if we have
 a login token maybe use it then disconnect..  What are the implications
 of using a publically known login token?

Make requires.PL generate the complete set of requires including perl
modules I provide.

The parameters for standard links (timescale between checks, how long
we wait before we consider a second failed check has made a link more
likely to be broken than the last) assume an amature/friendly setup in
which nothing other than waiting patiently can be done about broken
servers.  If this software is being used internally, e.g. on an
intranet in a large company situation, then such possibilities as
phoning the people running the server exist.  In that case, there
should be a way of calculating an acceptable downtime for each links
(obviously, external links, e.g. to the companies customers should be
treated more tolerantly) and changing all program parameters.  This
could lead to some links being checked half hourly and signalled
broken after as short a period as a few hours.  

If the rate of checking gets too high then the link checker could
become a noticable load on the company network.  This should not
happen.  The kind of resources that would need this kind of checking
would typically be noticed anyway, or need a different approach
(continuous monitoring at the server and upss etc.).  It's still worth
checking these resources at a slow rate anyway because some forgotten
dependency could come up when a service is changed.

It would be nice in principle to have logic to cope with the dynamic
nature of HTML infostructures.

	whenever we change a page we should update the links
	database and the indices

	we should add a link to the link checking database whenever we
	put a new link in.

	we don't worry about treating now non-existant links becuase
	the advantage of keeping them in the database is that
	immediate warning can be given if they are re-inserted into a
	page.. 

	Incremental updates where we search for pages newer than our
	last link extraction might be nice.

	Our indexes of links to and from objects should be updated
	gradually 

I couldn't do that in the design becuase when I started using DBMs for
the index databases they turned out to be many megabytes, several
times larger than the CDB files and so unmanagable.

At the time I started writing this, none of the free SQL databases
could satisfy the needs of this project.  Now they've improved
considerably. It would be nice to have an implementation of the Link
class which was overlayed over SQL storage.

Some of the techniques used in this set of programs seem a little
brutal (e.g. the fixlink program doesn't really understand html and
just guesses where to make substitutions..).  Comparative testing
against other programs would be nice.

Overlay links

It might be nice if people could keep personal information about links
in their own database.  For example, someone might have a link which
only exists for six months a year and want to record that it should
only be worried about at that time.  This would be kept in a DB file
as hashes which were then overlayed over the original Link, but
otherwise treated the same.

Possibly give extract-links a robot agent option in case someone wants
to use it for downloading from the www.  I'm not sure if this is
encouraging people to do things they shouldn't do or is something that
should be provided because otherwise people will use it without the
option.

REGRESSION TESTS

As interesting bugs are fixed they should be added here.  Later
regression tests should be added which check these cases are working.
Better yet, bug reports should be made in terms of failed regression
tests.
