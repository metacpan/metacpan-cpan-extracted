=head1 NAME

autotest - run Perl5 test programs as soon as they are modified or created

=head1 VERSION

version 0.006

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  autotest

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<autotest> is a program that runs your test programs whenever you change
them. Using it you don't have to switch between your editor and the shell
since your tests are run automatically when you save them.

Think "Continuous Testing".

=head1 EXAMPLE

Go to the directory where your test directory C<t> can be found. Run C<autotest>
in that directory. It runs all your test programs once when it's starting.

If one of the existing test programs are modified they are run again. Additionally,
test programs that are created are run as soon as they are found.
Modifications and creations of test programs are usually found after one second. 

Only failing tests are printed in the console.

When the last run had failing tests and in the current run no test failed, you'll
see a friendly message that things just got better.

=head1 CONTRIBUTING

=head1 SEE ALSO

L<Test::Continuous> has far more features. It runs the tests by running C<prove>
in an extra process; C<autotest> runs the tests within the same process via L<TAP::Harness>.
