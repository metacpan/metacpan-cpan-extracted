          - author data is now generated using the 00whois.xml document,
            rather than 01mailrc.txt, to get non-asciified author names

          - use new Acme::CPANAuthors::Factory

          - rewrite code and HTML generation by using embedded templates in
            the .pm file and authors in __DATA__, and a custom Dist::Zilla
            plugin
          - updated list of PAUSE IDs, by re-scanning cpan-faces

0.002     2013-06-01 17:04:26Z
