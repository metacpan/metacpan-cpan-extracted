<A HREF=../index.html>Portable Presenter</A> is a package designed to give
presentations.  Presentations need some dynamics, to be attractive,
although most people tend to use it too much.
<P>
A program is created when a slide has to be displayed.  The information
about the program is detected by the
<A HREF=../formatter/index.html>formatter</A>.  This is a string, for
instance <CODE>"phase 2 after 3"</CODE>.
The string is passed on to the selected
<A HREF=../dynamic/index.html>dynamic</A> style-element, which translates
this in a <EM>program</EM>-object: an internal structure of PPresenter.
<P>
When the slide is shown, PPresenter runs the program for you.  This means that
you have direct dealing with the program, but can contribute to it
indirectly.  End of discussion.
