        - Mild Changes;
Made some changes to the POD to make it a bit more readable, and some 
minor code changes, nothing that should directly impact the user.

        - POD Fixes Minor Enhancements;
Fixed some jacked up POD on Bot.pm
Cloned the ask_help() method in Auth.pm to pub_help() to make pub_help() 
more usable.  Modified the !seen command to be more friendly.  The command 
can now use pub_help() to display the help topic if the user doesn't use 
the proper syntax.

	- Username bug fix.
Seemed to be defaulting to the 'foolio' username when connecting. 
Missed typed the 'Username' field in the connection string for P::C::I.
It is now corrected.  Thanks to windedhero@gmail.com for finding that!!
