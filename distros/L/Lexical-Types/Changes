Revision history for Lexical-Types

0.15    2015-12-21 15:30 UTC
        + Chg : The new environment variable to enable thread tests on older
                perls is PERL_FORCE_TEST_THREADS. Note that this variable
                should only be turned on by authors.
        + Chg : A large chunk of boilerplate XS code, which is also used in
                other XS modules, has been factored out of the main .xs file
                to a collection of .h files in the xsh subdirectory.
        + Fix : This module can once again be built with strict C89 compilers.
        + Fix : Update the Windows ActivePerl + gcc 3.4 workaround for
                ExtUtils::MakeMaker 7.04. Thanks Christian Walde for reporting
                and feedback on this issue.
        + Fix : Segfaults when the module is loaded by several threads (or
                Windows emulated processes) ran in parallel.
        + Fix : Test failures of threads tests on systems with harsh resource
                constraints causing the threads to exit() during run.

0.14    2015-03-14 03:10 UTC
        + Chg : perl 5.8.4 is now required (instead of 5.8.3).
        + Fix : [RT #100202] : Fix for 5.21.6-to-be.
                Thanks Father Chrysostomos for reporting and contributing a
                patch.
        + Fix : Be really compatible with the optional OP_PARENT feature.
        + Tst : $ENV{$Config{ldlibpthname}} is now preserved on all platforms,
                which will address failures of t/81-threads-teardown.t with
                unusual compilers (like icc) that link all their compiled
                objects to their own libraries.

0.13    2014-10-04 23:25 UTC
        + Add : Support for the PERL_OP_PARENT optional feature introduced in
                perl 5.21.2.
        + Doc : The CAVEATS section now warns about the global slowdown during
                compilation caused by this pragma.
        + Fix : [RT #86112] : Doesn't hook new PADRANGE op in Perl 5.18.
                The PADRANGE optimization is now fully supported.
                Thanks Dagfinn Ilmari Mannsåker for reporting.
        + Fix : Segfaults in eval in an END block of a Win32 pseudo-fork.
        + Fix : Segfaults during global destruction of a thread or a
                pseudo-fork.
        + Fix : Check functions are now replaced and restored in a thread-safe
                manner, either by using the wrap_op_checker() function from perl
                when it is available (starting from perl 5.16) or by taking the
                OP_REFCNT mutex on older perls.
        + Tst : Author tests are no longer bundled with this distribution.
                They are only made available to authors in the git repository.
        + Tst : Test failures of t/81-threads-teardown.t on Cygwin and Android
                should have been addressed.
        + Tst : Threads tests will not fail anymore if resources constraints
                prevent the system from creating all the required threads.
        + Upd : Metadata overhaul.

0.12    2011-08-24 16:30 UTC
        + Fix : The pragma no longer vivifies the "Lexical::Types" entry in the
                hints hash %^H on perl 5.8.

0.11    2011-02-26 22:00 UTC
        + Fix : [RT #66164] : Lexical::Types hangs with PPI.
                This was actually a regression introduced together with the new
                peephole optimizer strategy, and that caused the pragma to hang
                on constructs like "for (;;) { ... }".
                Thanks Chisel Wright for reminding me about this issue.

0.10    2011-01-03 20:35 UTC
        + Add : The new constant LT_FORKSAFE can be tested to know whether the
                module will behave nicely when fork()ing. It's currently always
                true except on Windows where you need perl 5.10.1 for it to be
                true.
        + Chg : perl 5.8.3 is now required (instead of 5.8.0).
        + Fix : Scope leaks under perl 5.8-5.10.0.
        + Fix : Segmentation faults and misbehaviours in threaded applications.
        + Fix : Compatibility with perl 5.13.1 and higher.
        + Fix : Broken linkage on Windows with gcc 3.4, which appears in
                particular when using ActivePerl's default compiler suite.
                For those setups, the Lexical::Types shared library will now
                be linked against the perl dll directly (instead of the import
                library).
        + Tst : Threads tests are now only run on perl 5.13.4 and higher.
                They could segfault randomly because of what seems to be an
                internal bug of Perl, which has been addressed in 5.13.4.
                There is also an environment variable that allows you to
                forcefully run those tests, but it should be set only for
                author testing and not for end users.

0.09    2010-01-03 00:00 UTC
        + Fix : Building and testing with blead.
        + Fix : Unbalanced scopes when skipping a typed declaration.
        + Fix : Segfaults when Lexical::Types is loaded for the first time from
                inside a thread.
        + Fix : Leaks of memory associated with the root interpreter.
        + Fix : Work around Kwalitee test misfailures.
        + Opt : Less memory will be used for non-threaded perls version 5.10.0
                and below, and for threaded perls from version 5.10.1.

0.08    2009-07-04 19:35 UTC
        + Fix : Don't leak the old op info when a pointer table entry is reused.
        + Fix : Possibly missed constructs with eval STRING called in a thread.

0.07    2009-07-01 08:45 UTC
        + Chg : perl 5.8.x on MSWin32 is no longer considered as thread safe.
        + Fix : Work around a bug in perl 5.10.0 and lower that cause hints to
                propagate into required files.
        + Fix : Clean up map entries associated to uncatched OPs.

0.06    2009-05-01 19:00 UTC
        + Fix : The pragma now properly propagates into threaded eval STRING,
                effectively making the module thread safe. The new LT_THREADSAFE
                constant can be used to know whether the module could have been
                built with thread safety features enabled.

0.05    2009-04-28 21:40 UTC
        + Fix : Building with PERL_IMPLICIT_SYS set (especially on Win32).
        + Tst : Dieing in callbacks.

0.04    2009-03-07 15:45 UTC
        + Chg : Some implementation of pointer table is now used internally.
                This should make thread safety more robust.
        + Doc : Cleanups.
        + Tst : Using Lexical::Types inside the 'as' callback.
        + Tst : Thread safety.

0.03    2009-03-05 21:15 UTC
        + Doc : Discuss about using constants for types.
        + Fix : The PL_ppaddr[OP_PADSV] localization logic was refined so that
                it is kinder to other modules that replace it.
        + Tst : "my Str ($x, $y)" and "for my Str $x ()" constructs
        + Tst : uvar magic, magical tags.

0.02    2009-02-25 16:10 UTC
        + Add : Returning an empty list from the mangler skips the wrapping of
                the current typed lexical declaration.
        + Chg : The package and method names passed to the callbacks are now all
                read-only.

0.01    2009-02-24 23:20 UTC
        First version, released on an unsuspecting world.
