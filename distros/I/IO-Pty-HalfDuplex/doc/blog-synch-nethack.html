<!-- This is a post to the TAEB Blog (http://taeb-blog.sartak.org)
describing the challenge of deciding when the interactive program
'NetHack' is done sending output.  It covers many of the issues
involved in IO::Pty::HalfDuplex and so is kept here for documentation
purposes. -->

<p>One of the nastiest problems TAEB has to solve is also one of the
most mundane.  If you've ever played a game over a network or on a
heavily loaded computer, you are probably familiar with lag and the
problems it creates.  While NetHack, as a turn-based game, does not
suffer from directly lag-caused <em>deaths</em>, it is still very
difficult to make moves sensibly when the responses are delayed.</p>

<p>Bots like TAEB also suffer from lag, indeed much worse than people
do.  Twenty milliseconds is quite unnoticeable for a human but is an
eternity for a bot, and even at that timescale issues of finding the
end of a turn are normal.  Furthermore, bots are much less able to
recover from partial updates than people are, due to the lack of
sensible error-recovery.</p>

<p>Presumably, the player just exited a full-screen menu or changed
dungeon level.  A full screen redraw for NetHack is larger than the <a
    href="http://en.wikipedia.com/Maximum_transmission_unit">MTU</a>
of most networks, and due to lag, the second packet has been delayed
significantly.  (This doesn't require weird conditions; TCP normally
waits until data has been successfully received before sending more.)
As a result, the lower half of the current frame is black.  TAEB, on
seeing this frame, makes a couple of damaging inferences:</p>

<ul> <li>The lower half of the level has turned into solid rock.  This
    is an especially nasty case if the redraw was caused by stairs, as
    TAEB interprets large areas of new stone to indicate a brand new
    unexplored level, corrupting the dungeon graph.</li>

<li>The bottom line is all spaces and unparsable, resulting in error
spam and no stats.</li> </ul>

<p>Clearly, bots need a reliable way to tell when NetHack is done
sending output for the turn.  There have been several approaches to
this problem over the years.</p>

<h3>Consistently slow</h3>

<p>One of the oldest and simplest approaches is simply to sleep for
one second or so after every move, to wait for NetHack.  This works,
most of the time.  It has two major flaws; first it is very slow,
second it is unreliable - if lag spikes above 1 second, the bot may
see an incomplete frame.  Nevertheless, it is very simple to implement
and has been used in several efforts.</p>

<h3>Avoiding the issue</h3>

<p>Another approach which has been historically used, most famously by
the <a href="http://www.itctel.com/~apwhite/andrew.html">Angband
    Borg</a> and <a
    href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~appel/papers/rogomatic.html">Rog-o-matic</a>,
is to link the bot into the game's input routines.  In theory, this is
foolproof, but it carries dangers of a different sort, in addition to
the obvious restriction to local games.</p>

<p>If done incautiously, the linking can affect game mechanics or leak
information, thus compromising the validity of the bot effort.
Modifying the game requires a very in-depth knowledge of NetHack's
implementation, which is very unclean and non-transparent in places.
Furthermore, requiring the bot to be linked into NetHack greatly
complicates the build process; the bot cannot be built or distributed
as a self-contained object unless all of NetHack is duplicated,
prohibitive effort for many starting projects.   As such, the linking
approach is very rarely used.</p>

<p>We want TAEB to play in <a
    href="http://nethack.devnull.net/">tournaments on public
    servers</a>, which precludes linking.</p>

<h3>Inline pings</h3>

<p>One approach which is often proposed, but sadly does not work, is
the inline ping.  Simply send an invalid command after every real
command, and wait for the error.  Unfortunately, there is no command
which is invalid in every context in NetHack.  Not even control-r to
redraw the screen; it fails in prompts and menus.</p>

<h3>Telnet ping/pong</h3>

<p>Invented by Sartak for NetHack fairly early on, and the most common
method in use today (in particular, <a
    href="http://github.com/sartak/TAEB/blob/master/lib/TAEB/Interface/Telnet.pm">TAEB
    uses this</a>), this relies on telnet as a side channel.  A bot
connects to a telnet server using a raw TCP socket, and implements the
protocol itself; after every command is sent, the bot attempts to
negotiate an invalid telnet stream option (<tt>DO 99</tt>).<p>

<p>When a telnet daemon receives the packet containing the command, it
sees an option it does not support and responds in failure (<tt>WONT
    99</tt>), then passes the command off to NetHack.  Shortly
afterward, NetHack's response is responded to the bot.  Thus, the bot
receives NetHack's response very shortly after the "pong".  In effect,
the telnet options are used as a side channel to dynamically measure
network lag.  Since under normal conditions network lag is the
dominant component of total lag, this gives the bot a very good idea
of when the output should be expected.</p>

<p>The reliability of this approach is improved by kernel packet
coalescing, also known as <a
    href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagle's_algorithm">Nagle's
    algorithm</a>.  When the pong is sent, the network implementation
at the server waits a short time to potentially send a larger packet;
if packet sending is low-priority, this will additionally tend to be
delayed until NetHack is done calculating.  With the pong and the
response generally in the same packet, they are guaranteed to arrive
at the bot at exactly the same time.</p>

<p>While good enough for bots, this approach is not quite foolproof.
If NetHack takes a long time to reply to a command, due to system
load, slow execution (there are several quadratic algorithms in the
game, most notably monster movement and item stack sorting), or simply
being swapped out, it is possible for the kernel to time out the
attempt to coalesce, and the pong will arrive significantly before the
output.  This has been the source of several unreproducable errors in
TAEB.</p>

<p>This approach is also limited to telnet servers.  It does not help
at all with lag as it occurs on heavily-loaded local systems, and does
not work well with other network protocols.  In principle SSH could be
used, however the vastly higher complexity of the SSH protocol makes a
custom implementation prohibitively difficult.</p>

<h3>Expectations and Confusion</h3>

<p>Will Noble (futilius)'s <i>bridey</i> works on an entirely
different principle from the other bots.  Instead of relying on
out-of-band data to find complete frames, bridey is more like a human
in that it waits for a frame that looks complete.  The code which
generates actions also provides a predicate for a sensible-looking
result; fully filled bottom line, cursor on the character, etc.  When
an action is run, bridey waits for a frame that satisfies the
predicate.  To guard against programming oversights, the predicates
are made partially dependant on wait time, and become more lenient as
more data has had a chance to arrive.</p>

<p>Actually, bridey combines this with other mechanisms above; the
time, as it is used in predicates, is measured in telnet ping/pong
cycles.  For instance, the move action has a final timeout of 4
cycles.  This allows the reliability of the expect system to partially
stack on the reliability of ping/pong.  bridey, like TAEB, uses simple
sleeps on the local interface.</p>

<h3>Abusing POSIX Job Control for Fun and Profit</h3>

<p>In 2008 I developed a novel method, which is currently being
adopted by TAEB for the local interface.  NetHack is single threaded
and makes very little use of asynchronous calls, so when it is blocked
on tty input it cannot possibly generate output until more keys
arrive.  So, if we could somehow find out when NetHack blocks, we
would solve the synchronization problem permanently - unlike the
methods above, this is immune to system load.</p>

<p>On the surface, finding out when a process blocks would seem to
require low-level, privileged, and generally highly nonportable code.
However, we are not the first user of the information.  It is possible
in UNIX to move processes between the foreground and background at
will; if it were possible for background processes to read keyboard
input, chaos would result.  The traditional solution is for the kernel
to stop any process when it attempts to read in the background.
Stops, like deaths, result in <tt>wait()</tt> events; this is
necessary in order that the shell may continue them.</p>

<p>With this insight, the solution seems fairly obvious - simply put
NetHack in the background, then when it stops, let it read.  There are
a few complications in this, though.  First, it's not possible to
simply shovel data into a stopped reader; it has to be briefly
continued in the foreground.  How long is briefly?  Depends on...
system load.  Fortunately, there is a trick we can use to eliminate
inaccuracy - check for data on the virtual keyboard, with ourselves in
the foreground.  If we see anything, the slave needs to read more, and
we re-continue it, using exponential backoff.  Of course, data typed
is not always immediately available due to line-buffering and various
forms of special-key processing - but that applies to us too, so we
still get the right answer.</p>

<p>Even with that settled, POSIX only allows a process to use job
control if it lives inside the pseudo-terminal.  That means, we need
to fork a slave in order to do the actual manipulation, and
communicate using pipes.</p>

<p>This is very unusual activity terminal driver, and it has exposed
two bugs in the BSD kernel so far.  First, in all known versions of
BSD, a process which reads in the background does not actually receive
the stop signal until it returns to user mode; but it returns to user
mode only once the wait for terminal data completes!  In regular
usage, this is masked, because when you type <tt>bg</tt> all waiting
threads are woken, but it was a killer for us; the eventual workaround
I found was to briefly change the terminal blocking mode, thus forcing
the kernel to reconsider all active blocks.  Finding this bug, and the
workaround for it, took an annoyingly long amount of time.</p>

<p>Another bug the project found was that the BSD kernel does a
one-second sleep whenever a process that is already in the background
tries to read.  The reasons for this are quite unclear, but it has the
effect of killing performance of this approach.  Fortunately, recent
versions of Darwin (OS 10.5.7 is known to work) have a rewritten sleep
system, and this call is no more.</p>

<p>A comparatively minor issue was found in Linux; attempting to read
from an idle psuedoterminal master fails with a "No such device"
error, instead of the EOF return that would be expected of devices
with pipe semantics.  I'm not sure if this is a bug, but it did
require workaround code.</p>

<p>This method is implemented in the <tt><a
        href="http://search.cpan.org/~sorear/IO-Pty-HalfDuplex-0.01/">IO::Pty::HalfDuplex</a></tt>
perl module.</p>

<h3>Variations on the theme</h3>

<p>Job control abuse works pretty well on Linux and Darwin, but what
if you're on a different platform?  Well, there's always low-level,
privileged, and generally non-portable code.  As seems to often be the
case with hacks like this, it usually takes the form of a debugger API
abuse; set breakpoints on the functions that can read from the
terminal, and arrange to capture output somehow.  These approaches
share a common liability; debugger interfaces are highly
security-sensitive and are often in some way disabled.</p>

<ul> <li>On most UNIXes (including the BSDs) there is a system call
    <tt><a
            href="http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=ptrace&sektion=">ptrace</a></tt>
    which fits the bill perfectly.  Unfortunately, while the style of
    <tt>ptrace</tt> is virtually identical everywhere, no two UNIXes
    implement the call in exactly the same way.  <tt>ptrace</tt>
    implements security by refusing to trace processes of other users
    and denying user and group changes while active; this is a real
    bother for us, as NetHack is normally installed setgid - it
    escalates its group to one that can write to the saves and
    scoreboard.</li>

    <li>Windows has a debugger interface which is well documented and
    consistent across versions.  Nice?  Well, Windows also has, last
    time I counted, 30 different documented ways to read from the
    console.  Writing the correct traps to catch them all would be
    interesting, to say the least.</li>

    <li>Ironically, the best chances seem to exist on DOS.  Programs
    are debugged by directly hooking the operating system, allowing
    for a fully consistent interface, and there are very few paths for
    keyboard reading.  Unfortunately, CPAN on DOS is non-functional,
    and installing any large Perl system without it is extremely
    tedious.</li>

    <li>Departing from the trend of debuggers, it is also possible on
    the BSDs to simply read the process status.  Compared to the
    ptrace method, this has the advantage of working on segid
    processes, but requires polling.</li> </ul>

<p>I plan to implement most of these in
<tt>IO::Pty::HalfDuplex</tt>.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>In the field of bot writing, even the simplest things can prove
almost insurmountably complex.  This is very evident in dealing with
lag, both network and loading.  Lag-related problems are a major cause
of unreproducable faults in even the most sophisticated NetHack bots.
Many of the simplest approaches to controlling lag are deeply flawed
and will make debugging difficult.  Let this be a lesson to everyone
who wants to start from scratch.  Fortunately, you don't have to; TAEB
is designed to be a framework, to support additional AIs easily.</p>
