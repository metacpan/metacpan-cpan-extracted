DESCRIPTION

    Combine multiple checks into a single test. Sometimes you want a test
    tool that has multiple possible failure points, but you want to hide
    that complexity from the user of your test tool. This class helps
    provide a OO interface to make this easy without having to track status
    and diagnostics in separate variables.

    If any one check fails the test will fail. If all checks pass then the
    test will pass. You can log diagnostics which will be directed to
    either diag or note depending on if the test fails or passes
    (respectively) overall.

ATTRIBUTES

 context

     my $ctx = $combo->context;

    The Test2::API::Context context. When created, this context takes into
    account the extra stack frames so that any failure diagnostics will
    point back to the call point of your tool.

 name

     my $name = $combo->name;

    The string name of the test. The default combo object test will be used
    if not provided.

 status

    The boolean status of the test. Zero 0 for failure and One 1 for pass.
    You should generally not set this yourself directly, and instead use
    "pass", "fail" or "ok" below.

FUNCTIONS

 combo

     my $combo = combo $test_name;
     my $combo = combo;

    Exported by default. Takes an optional test name. Will use combo object
    test if not provided.

METHODS

    Note that methods that do not specify a return type will return the
    combo object, so such methods may be chained.

 finish

     my $status = $combo->finish;

    Complete the combo test by generating the appropriate Test2 events and
    release its context. It also returns the pass/fail status, to make it a
    good choice to return from your tool, since it is a common practice for
    tools to return true/false when the pass/fail (respectively).

     sub test_tool {
       my $combo = combo;
       ...
       return $combo->finish;
     }

    If the the combo object is not explicitly finished when the object is
    destroyed then it will be finished for you in its destructor.

 log

     $combo->log(@messages);

    Include the given @messages as either a diag or note if the test
    overall fails or passes (respectively).

 pass

     $self->pass;
     $self->pass(@messages);

    Marks a passing check. @messages if provided will be added to the log.

 fail

     $self->fail;
     $self->fail(@messages);

    Marks a failing check. @messages if provided will be added to the log.

 ok

      $self->ok($status);
      $self->ok($status, @messages);

    Marks a passing or failing check depending on if the $status is true or
    false (respectively). @messages if provided will be added to the log.

CAVEATS

    This class creates a Test2::API::Context, and does release it when the
    object is either finished (via "finish") or when it falls out of scope.
    Because of this any caveats about storing and releasing contexts also
    applies to objects of this class.
