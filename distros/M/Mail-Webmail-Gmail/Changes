      in a field ( Thanks again Daniel! ).
    - Proxy support has stopped working for me, not sure if its an
      issue with the proxy I've been using, or if its an issue with
      the update I did to the logon process in 0.08.  ( After more testing
      it appears that something changed with the proxy that Im using,
      further investigation will be required to find out what I can do
      to fix it.  Let me know if this breaks for anyone else ).
    - I have met all of my goals for 1.0, so I guess this is the first
      1.0 candidate, let me know what you think.
