PGObject-Type-DateTime

This module provides a general wrapper for Perl DateTime objects for PostgreSQL
date and time values.  Once it is registered, it returns DateTime objects (via
this wrapper class) which can be automatically serialized into PostgreSQL 
date and time values.  Whether to print date and time is persisted and stored.
