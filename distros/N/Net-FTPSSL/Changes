Revision history for Perl extension Net::FTPSSL.

TODO:
  - Implement a "find" function similar to Unix's find command.
  - Support IPv6 as well as IPv4.  (started, I can detect if IPv6 is supported
    by IO::Socket::SSL.) [I don't have access to a IPv6 network to test with.]
  - Fix so Trace isn't so verbose.  Such as making freqency a function of file
    size & block size.
  - Fix to support MLSD & MLST commands.

Version - YYYY/MM/DD
--------------------
0.39 2017/10/23 08:30:00
  - Updated the LISCENSE file to 2017 (from 2015)
  - Changed default from TLS v1.0 to TLS v1.2 and rearranged the POD a bit.
  - Started depreciating useSSL.  Now prints out warning if used!  Warning
    says to use option "SSL_version" instead.

0.38 2017/03/30 08:30:00
  - Bug Id: 120802.  PreserveTimestamp bugs with _mfmt() & _mdtm().  I pulled
    the arguments off the stack in the wrong order.  Corrected this.
  - Added instructions on how to install this module in an alternate location
    to the README file.

0.37 2017/03/27 08:30:00
  - Found an issue with size() function when it gets the file size via "STAT".
    Found a server where "STAT" returned the results in a different format.
  - Removed duplicate setting of {help_cmds_no_syntax_available} key in _help().
  - Bug Id: 120623.  Missed the 2nd half of the ticket.  When Croak=>1 is turned
    on to not treat the failure of "SITE HELP" as a fatal error!

0.36 2017/03/20 08:30:00
  - Updated the copyright & version number.
  - Added additional module versions to the logs in BEGIN.
  - Bug Id: 120341.  Turns out the latest release of IO-Socket-SSL broke
    this module.  (v2.046 broken, v2.012 worked)  Looks like the start_SSL()
    call is removing my "_FTPSSL_arguments" hash entry.
  - Bug Id: 120623.  The OverrideHELP option had issues.  Shouldn't have called
    _feat() or _site_help() for =>1 or =>\@lst.  So removed in _help()!
  - Bug Id: 120621.  Request for a new feature of allowing objects that inherit
    from IO::Handle wherever it asks for a GLOB!  put/get/DebugLogFile/etc ...
    Implemented via new helper function _isa_glob().  Also updated POD.
  - Updated README section on using client certificates.
  - Updated t/20-certificate.t to use a callback & updated the %certificate
    hash.

0.35 2016/11/03 08:30:00
  - Minor POD updates.
  - Bug Id: 118418.  Added catastrophic failure protection to _croak_or_return()
    by adding:  local $SIG{PIPE} = "IGNORE"; before connection termination
    logic.  Limits the scope to just this one code block.

0.34 2016/07/27 08:30:00
  - BEHAVIOR CHANGE - Added fix_supported() as a way to make corrections to
    supported().  Editing the returned hash reference of _help() no longer
    works!  This new method does both additions & removals.
  - BEHAVIOUR CHANGE - Modified _mfmt() & _mdtm() to be able to handle localtime
    vs gmtime based on changes to how PreserveTimestamp work.  As an alternate
    way, the behavior can be overriden by a new $local_flag option.  The
    default behavior is still GMT time.  See the POD for a description of how
    PreserveTimestamp now works.
  - Made POD clarification & other comment updates.
  - Increased TRACE_MOD from 5 to 10 blocks.
  - Added BEGIN block to detect if IPv6 support is possible.  It does this by
    asking IO::Socket::SSL instead of reinventing the wheel.
  - Moved the generation of the Debug log header info for CPAN support to BEGIN
    as well so that this info gets centralized instead of repeated.
  - Added Domain/Family as a new option for choosing IPv4 vs IPv6.
  - Added OverrideHELP => -1 option to use FEAT instead, when HELP is broken!
  - Updated quot() to recognize that MLSD also requires a data channel.
    Also improved the disable HELP logic used here.
  - Broke up _feat() into _feat() & feat().  Also added feat() to the POD.
    Done since under some circumstances the feature list can be dynamic!
    Also changed logic on how to tell if OPTS is supported or not.
    Finally drops HELP from the list of FEAT commands returned if OverrideHELP
    was used.
  - Rewrote _help() to make it less confusing.  Adding OverrideHELP=>-1 made it
    clear it was too messy to support ongoing.  Much more understandable now.
    Also made it more reliable to get the list of site commands supported.
  - Fixed PreserveTimestamp bug in transfer() & xtransfer().
  - Added new option xWait for use by xput() & xtransfer().  Some servers won't
    honor the rename of the scratch file to it's final name without instituting
    a delay.  So this option allows you to specify one.
  - README - Added more notes about turning on/off SSL logging.  Newer
    versions allow for dynamic turning on/off.  Also updated comments on the
    naming of the trace logs.
  - t/10-complex.t - Changes to the main test script!
    * Now uses fix_supported() in it's is_file() tests since these test cases
      hit some lies told by some servers!
    * Fixed so it's main logs are named after this test program like the other
      test cases do.
    * Added new test to verify if the MDTM command correctly uses GMT time
      instead of local time.  (Assumes MFMT will use the same time zone!) Did
      this test early enough so that the last connection used the correct
      PreserveTimestamp settings for tests depending on it!
    * Added xWait of 1 second to deal with problem FTP/S servers that require
      a wait for the xput & xtransfer tests to work.
  - t/05-readonly.t - Renamed 05-simple to 05-readonly to more acurately
    describe the types of tests this test script does!  Updated in MANIFEST &
    README as well.

0.33 2016/07/06 08:30:00
  - BEHAVIOUR CHANGE - Since many openssl libraries are tightening their
    security, I'm adding a new option to preserve backwards compatibility.
    By default this module now reuses the context of the command channel
    when opening a data channel.  If you need to revert back to the previous
    default of not reusing the context for data channels, you must now use
    option "DisableContext => 1" to do so.  But hopefully the need for this
    option will be rare.  See the POD for more details.
  - BEHAVIOUR CHANGE - Added support for SNI in the SSL handshake.  Always
    does it if supported.
  - Changed logic on how to detect if a default "SSL_verify_mode" value needed
    to be set to VERIFY_NONE() for the caller in new().  Now checks for specific
    SSL_* options before setting.
  - Can now pass SSL options directly to new().  You no longer need to use the
    "SSL_Client_Certificate" option to pass the hash reference of SSL options.
    Currently only recognises IO::Socket::SSL options that start with SSL_.
    If any start with something else, I'll address in a future release.
  - Clarified some POD information on a few methods.
  - Enhanced "size" function to use STAT if SIZE wasn't available!
  - Fixed case where sometimes the login account used wasn't being masked in
    the response in the logs.
  - Now prints the INET version in the log file.
  - Resets $ERRSTR to default in new() in case previous call had errors!
  - Fixed t/10-complex.t func run_stat_test() to test the "is_file" & "is_dir()"
    functions.  Some tests disable the "SIZE" command so it can test the new
    alternate size logic as well.
  - New test program t/05-simple.t that does a simple read only test against
    the FTPS server.  Added so that you can run a simple test against servers
    you don't want to upload anything to during the tests.  These tests are
    not as robust as the t/10-complex.t tests so failures here are not as
    meaningfull.  So run t/10-complex if you encounter any issues for more
    analysis.
  - Added t/05-simple.t to the MANIFEST.
  - Updated the Copyright in the README file.  And reworded a few sections.
  - Updated all t/*.t files to add a retry the 1st time they try to connect
    to a server via new().  Added a hard coded "SSL_cipher_list" value if
    the defaults don't work.  This kludge might not work for everyone.
  - Modified t/20-certificate.t to be a bit more robust.
  NOTE: Found a server where supported() doesn't completely work.  That server
        fails to put a "*" after some of the commands it didn't implement.  So
        had to hack a couple of test cases that hit this issue.

0.32 2016/06/14 08:30:00
  - Clarified some POD information on a few methods.
  - Bug ID: 115296 - Changed the use_ssl test when providing custom SSL_Version
    settings via the SSL_Client_Certificate option.  Now does a positive test
    for SSL instead of a negative test.
  - Modified t/10-complex.t to do a better uput test.  Put into its own test
    function so that I could also validate the filename returned instead of just
    assuming it was correct!
  - Added additional test cases for files with spaces in their names.
  - Added run_stat_test() for future tests for "is_..." functions.

0.31 2016/03/30 08:30:00
  - Updated the Copyright.
  - Fixed issue where "uput" cmd generated "Invalid number of parameters" error.
    Fix is to call STOU a 2nd time with no file name.  But if this happens and
    the server doesn't return the file name, uput now returns "?" instead of
    making what it knows is a very flawed guess! (since it doesn't use the hint)
  - Implemented mdtm() server bug fix.  Some rare servers do (19xxx) instead of
    (20xx) for the year part of the timestamp returned.  So implemented
    autodetection & fix for this server issue!
  - Added undocumented Debug value to supress printing out the HELP information
    during login.  It got in the way of debugging via add-hock perl scripts.
  - Added is_file() to validate if the given name is a regular file!
  - Added is_dir() to validate if the given name is a directory!
  - Fixed bug in t/10-complex.t that made it look like "make test" succeeded
    when in fact it encountered a fatal error forcing it to skip over all the
    other deeper tests.  Affected call to config func: check_for_pasv_issue()
  - Fixed some undef warnings in "uput() test" in t/10-complex.t when talking
    to buggy windows FTPS servers that says it supports "uput" but handles it
    really strangely or not at all.  Now also handles new "?" return value in
    the strange case.
  - Fixed bug in t/10-complex.t in test_log_redirection() failing a EPSV test
    when the destination server didn't support this functionality.
  - Modified t/10-complex.t to print the "OK" results to the log file.
    Makes it a bit easier to associate failures to what's in the log file!
  - Fixed some typoes in the POD.

0.30 2015/08/13 08:30:00
  - INCOMPATIBILITY WARNING!  If you've been hacking internal undocumented
    variables referenced by my module, your code is most likely broken with this
    release!  If you've been doing "$ftps = new (...);  $x = ${*$ftps}{abc};",
    it's now "$x = ${*$ftps}{_FTPSSL_arguments}->{abc};" for a lot of them.
    This change was made to make it less likely I'll accidentaly step on a
    IO::Socket::SSL variable in a future release of either module.  It also
    helps me with error log traces & some future plans if they ever happen.
  - Changed t/00-basic.t so it no longer needs to call uc().  Also now uses
    __PACKAGE__ keyword instead of hard coded text.
  - Fixed error message bug in _get_data_channel().  Got SSL_version from wrong
    hash.
  - Reorganized the order of some functions in the POD.
  - Fixed minor bug in the masking of the user id when writing to a log file!
  - Looks like the sysread() call in response() is sometimes spurriously setting
    the special variable "$!" for Perl 5.10.1 on AIX 7.1.  So if the command
    looks complete I'm going to ignore the error message returned in "$!".
    I'm probably going to have to figure out a better test for this later on!
  ######
  - EXPERIMENTAL: Added 2 new functions set_dc_from_hash() and copy_cc_to_dc().
    They provide two different ways to micro manage the SSL options used to
    manage the Data Channel without the need to hack the code base.  There are
    more SSL options than I know what to do with so hopefully this will help
    with managing the data channel.

0.29 2015/07/06 08:30:00
  - Fixed typo that broke reuse session.  Bug was overwriting key value!
  - Fixed uc() warning in t/00-basic.t for Perl 12 & above.

0.28 2015/07/01 08:30:00
  - Updated README file with info on how to turn on SSL tracing so that I can
    more easily find that information again.
  - Fixed log display issue if there was no username and/or password passed
    to login().
  - In quot() fixed pattern match bug when setting $cmd2.  (\S* to \S+)
  - Added LICENSE file to my package (+ Manifest).   Kwaltiee Experimental # 3.
  - Rewrote Makefile.PL to support optional parameters so I could add
    conditional Kwaltiee Score variables.
  - Added MIN_PERL_VERSION tag to Makefile.PL   Extra Kwaltiee Metric # 1.
    Enforced Ver. 5.6.1, since that is the earliest perl my module was tested
    against by the smoke testers.  But it was last tested that way with v0.11.
    Version 5.8.8 is the oldest version of Perl I test against regularly.
  - Added LICENSE tag to Makefile.PL            Extra Kwaltiee Metric # 2.
  - Added Net::SSLeay as a fake dependancy to Makefile.PL & as a test case in
    t/00-basic.t for the benifit of some Smoke Testers who fail my module due
    to this indirect dependancy not working.  I don't use this module, but it's
    obviously a dependancy of IO::Socket::SSL.  But it looks like it might
    not be a declared dependancy since it's failing to load for a smoke tester
    while he's testing my module.
  - Fixed _print_LOG() to support multiple arguments.  So no longer have to
    concatinate everything before using.
  - Rewrote _debug_print_hash() to be able to handle hashes of any depth.
    It's now recursive with infinite loop detection.
  - Added logic to support reusing the session instead of just the context.
    This is via the new option "ReuseSession=>1".
    Thanks Forrest Tiffany for your patch!  (Bug Ids 76108 & 104407)

0.27 2015/03/28 08:30:00
  - Fixed Bug Id # 102680.  Bad "supported" test in xput/xtransfer with
    regard to OverrideHELP=>1.  (All other OverrideHELP options worked fine.)
  - Added "all_supported()" to assist fixing the above bug & put into the POD.
  - Some minor POD corrections.
  - Added check to quot("HELP") to see if HELP was overriden.  Required
    a minor change in new() to support this logic.  We know help is broken if
    OverrideHELP was used!
  - Added the INTERPRETING THE LOGS section in the POD text.

0.26 2015/02/10 08:30:00
  - The deprecialted SSL_Advanced option now causes new() to call croak.
    I'll remove any remaining reference to it in v0.27 or v0.28. (2016 earliest)
  - The POD text no longer mentions the SSL_Advanced option at all.
  - Added to README the new environment variable created for the test scripts
    in the previous release.
  - The RFC links in the SEE ALSO section had all expired.  Located replacement
    links for all referenced documents.  Looks like they were just moved to
    another location on the same web site.  A victim of web-site remodeling.
  - Enhanced _debug_print_hash().  It originally worked with just GLOBs, but
    now works with regular hashes as well.  Also fixed to follow SCALAR
    references.
  - Now dumps to the log file the contents of the SSL_Client_Certificate
    hash if provided.  Was difficult to debug logic when it wasn't logged.
  - Bug Id # 101388, reusing SSL_Client_Certificate options on the data channel.
    Added additional options to go with SSL_reuse_ctx to resolve this issue.
    I checked the IO-Socket-SSL docs & all variables in the bug id are by
    default part of SSL_reuse_ctx.  So some low level code isn't resolving
    the context correctly.  This is a work arround.  (Certificates were not
    being used here.  Just using the context for strict hostname verification.)
    May be a case that when certificates are not used, the context isn't
    fully used either.

0.25 2014/09/05 08:30:00
  WARNING: This is a major upgrade & may not be 100% backwards compatible with
           existing code.  Also the response() redesign may not work for all
           FTPS servers!  It's a work in progress!  So comments are welcome!
  - Upgraded the minimum version of IO-Socket-SSL required from v1.08 to v1.26
    so that I could remove the warnings in the POD for ccc().  But it should
    still work with the earlier versions if you hack the code.  But don't rely
    on this in future releases.  (minus the ccc command)
  - Modified the Synopsis to use Croak since no one was reading my comments
    about using it too closely anyway.
  - Added a new pattern for uput() to check for file names with.
    Also fixed to guarentee it will never return any path info, just the
    base file name itself.  [ This change may break existing programs. ]
  - Another hack to recover from a garbled CCC response.  This hack just
    prevents unnecessary warnings.
  - Hit a weird FTP server that requiers me to flip flop the binary/ASCII
    settings on the server/client.  See mixedModeAI() & mixedModeIA().
  - Added a way to print Perl warnings to the log file. (trapWarn)  It will
    chain things if warnings were already trapped.  Even between multiple open
    Net::FTPSSL object logs.  This is only usefull as a debugging tool when
    reporting on errors via CPAN.  It helps provide context to the warnings
    that affect this code base.
  - Added get_log_filehandle() to allow someone to gain access to the open
    filehandle used to write to the log file generated when Debug is turned on
    and you specified a log file via DebugLogFile.
  - Now allows DebugLogFile to be an open file handle (GLOB).
  - Fixed quot() to echo the command if it's one of those dissallowed.
    Also now strips off any leading spaces from the command before using it.
  - Found out use "sub DESTROY" rather than "sub END" for objects. (Just a FYI)
    Surprise, Surprise!  Sometimes END is called before DESTROY is!
  - Moved some logic out of quit() into the new DESTROY() method.  No longer
    need to hack object termination logic via quit().
  - Added END to handle final clean up for trapWarn().
  - Fixed warnings in function _feat() caused by strange server returns.
  - Fixed warnings in function _help() caused by strange server returns.
  - Fixed 20-certificate.t bug where $ENV{HOME} is not defined for all OS.
  - Fixed 10-complex.t to use the new warning logic.
  - Fixed 20-certificate.t to use the new warning logic.
  - Fixed t/10-complex.t & t/20-certificate.t to use a 30 second Timeout
    instead of using the default 2 minutes.
  - Reworked response() with regard to Bug # 97608. (related to Bug # 73115)
    Had to redesign how this method worked.  It was getting too convoluted
    to patch any further.  Was the only way to properly fix _help & _feat.
  - Second issue for Bug # 9706 was an issue with very long login messsages
    hit an unexpected Timeout issue (last release enhancement).  Turns out the
    Timeout logic in response() didn't always work properly if you didn't read
    in the entire response via a single call to sysread().  Had two options,
    make the buffer huge for the login response or make the logic more complex,
    to only check for Timeouts on the command channel for new commands.  Turns
    out select() & sysread() don't actually compare notes.  Hense another reason
    to redesign how things worked.
  - This rewrite of response() broke the ccc() hack.  So had to redesign how
    this hack worked as well.  [May break existing programs using CCC!]
  - Added special case Debug=>99 for more detailed logging for debugging
    the new response code base in the future.
  - Added new environment variable (FTPSSL_DEBUG_LEVEL) to t/10-complex.t to
    enable low level debugging of the new response() code.  There is no prompt
    to turn on this feature.  Added more as a reminder that it can be done!
  - Updated the SSL_Advanced depreciated warning that it will soon be removed
    in a future release.  It was depreciated in v0.18 way back in 2011, so I
    feel it's about time to have it removed.  Just giving fair warning here!
    I'll remove it in v0.26 or v0.27.

0.24 2014/06/30 08:30:00
  - Makefile.PL fix, only asks question if Net::HTTPTunel isn't present!
    Also now defaults to "N" instead of "Y" if module not present.
  - Fixed bug in supported().  Unsupported commands are followed with "*"
    in help.  Most do "CMD*", but found some servers doing "CMD *" instead.
  - Fixed bug in 20-certificate.t where we were getting a false failure
    on nlst().  Fixed to explicitly check the response code instead of
    assuming an error when nothing was found.  Fixed list() as well.
  - Same fix in 10-complex.t, even though tests designed to always return
    something.
  - Added transfer() to transfer files from one system to another system
    without the need to make a local copy of the file on your file system.
  - Added xtransfer() as well.
  - Added transfer & xtransfer validation to 10-complex.t to test things out.
  - Added a new environment variable default for *.t prompts.
  - Bug # 95411 - Patch provided by ian@iansramblings.com.  Fixes hang issue
    when the command channel unexpectedly drops.  Does this by implementing
    a timeout in response().
    #-------  (Should I do this for the many data channel sysreads as well?)

0.23 2013/08/01 08:30:00
  - Added clarification to use of SSL_Client_Certificate option in pod text.
  - Added Bug Id 82094 to support tunneling through a proxy server via the
    ProxyArgs option.  Supports both proxy servers that require a password as
    well as those that don't.  This option requires Net::HTTPTunnel to use.
    But this new module isn't required if you don't use tunneling.
    (perl Makefile.PL will ask.)
  - Added optional proxy server questions if Net::HTTPTunnel is installed for
    the test scripts (t/*.t).  It warns you if it's missing during the test.
  - Fixed bug in login() so the call to help() only happens if the login is
    successfull.
  - Bug Id 84376 uncoverd bug in IO-Socket-SSL versions 1.79 to 1.85 when
    using Certificats for the Data Channel & getting a Man-In-The-Middle (MITM)
    warning that didn't apply.  So skip those releases.
  - Bug Id 85420 same MITM warning as the other bug, but this time without using
    Certificates in the command channel.  This required a code change in new()
    to fix.
  - Fixed masking issue when writing to the log file when the value that needed
    to be masked contained regex special chars.
  - Added clarification that any warnings printed below the 10-complex.t tests
    are just that.  Warnings, not errors preventing things from working.  They
    are collected so the developer can be notified about them for fixing in
    furture releases.  They are also written to the end of the log now as well.

0.22 2012/05/21 08:30:00
  - Bug # 77072 requested to autodetect the need for using the PRET command.
    The old test in t/10-complex.t was different & doesn't interfere.  The docs
    in the POD now mark the Pret option as optional for cases where auto-detect
    doesn't work!
  - Fixed issue with ccc that the server sometimes responds to a successful NOOP
    twice, resulting in command/responses getting out of sync.  (Another hack)
  - Fixed quot() bug introduced with Bug # 74025 uc() fix in the last release.
    Accidently shifted off the arguments a 2nd time during the uc() call.
  - Fixed the return code in restart() to always be 1 instead of undef, since
    it never fails.  Also moved its description towards the end of the POD text.

0.21 2012/02/15 08:30:00
  - Fixed bad call to _croak_or_return () in _get_data_channel() when dealing
    with failed certificates for data connections.
  - Bug # 74547, a request to support ftp PRET command for distributed FTP data
    channel transfers.  New option to execute PRET before all PASV calls.
  - updated t/10-complex.t to dynamically check if PRET is needed.
  - Bug # 74035, as of Perl 5.12, uc($x) gives warning if $x is undef.  Added
    checks to avoid these warnings.  Did via [ uc($x||""); ]
  - Fixed both test cases to no longer send Port as undefined to get rid of
    warnings in log file. (Passing undef wasn't realistic, was just convenient.)
  - t/10-complex.t now explicity checks if any warnings are generated and does
    a request for feadback instead of as an error if any are found.  Should help
    considerably with debugging any code changes in the future.
  - Added new internal method _feat() to get additional commands to be
    recognized by supported().
  - Enhanced _help() in parsing it's response from the server & other significnt
    enhancements.  Major rewrite of this one method.
  - Above rewite uncovered bug in t/10-complex.t to fix in a supported() test.
  - Did some tweaking to the workings of the OverrideHELP option due to changes
    in _help() & supported().
  - Updated POD for supported() to describe changes to functionality.

0.20 2012/01/01 08:30:00
  - Fixed bug # 73115 where it looks like the response() had unexpected breaks
    in it.  Instead of returning "xyz message" the FTPS server was returning
    "x" on one line and "yz message" on another line.  And the code was
    treating "x" as the entire response (since there was no "-" after it.)
    Fixed so that if a response starts with a number that's less than 3
    digits with nothing else following it, to assume we hit this bug.
    The risk to this fix is that we might try to read past the response
    on some other server and cause things to hang.  So that's an issue to
    keep an eye out for after this release.
  - Fixed minor issue with "HELP" not supported on some boxes.  If this happens
    supported() will now always return false unless you use OverrideHELP.
  - Now prints the hash values chosen for new() to the logs.
  - Fixed so scrubbing out sensitive info from the logs is only done when debug
    is turned on instead of doing it all the time.
  - Reorganized the options to new() in the POD to put the less useful and
    special case options to new() last.
  - Other minor POD corrections and additions.

0.19 2011/09/26 08:30:00
  - If you use SSL_Advanced, it now writes to STDERR that you are using a
    depreciated feature.
  - Modified 10-complex.t & 20-certificate.t to honor the PERL_MM_USE_DEFAULT
    envionment variable for the smoke testers to always use defaults, which
    skips executing these 2 scripts.  BUG # 69982.
    (Same thing now happens for "make test < /dev/null" as well.)
    Couldn't use ExtUtils::MakeMaker::prompt() per request since "make test"
    wouldn't display the questions it was asking & it looked like it hung in
    interactive mode for normal users!  So based my solution on that function
    using diag() instead of print.
  - Fixed Typos in POD text Bug # 70438 & some misleading comments.
  - Updated the README file to include comments on t/20-certificate.t and what
    changes are required before you can use it.
  - Updated t/20-certificate.t to highlight the section of code that the README
    file is talking about and the initial prompt to remind the user to see the
    the README file for the needed modifications before running the test!

0.18 2011/07/29 08:30:00
  - Added SSL_Client_Certificate to support client certificates on the data
    channel as well as the command channel. Bug ID: 69327.
  - Depreciated SSL_Advanced in favor of SSL_Client_Certificate.  SSL_Advanced
    is now just an alias for SSL_Client_Certificate for backwards compatibility.
    I just feel the new name better describes what we are trying to do with it
    now that this feature is supported.
  - More fixes/clarifications to the POD text.
  - Fixed minor wild card issue with LIST & NLST if "+" was in the file name.
  - Added restart() function to be compatable with Net::FTP for restarts.
  - Added ability to restart downloads/get() where previous attempt left off.
  - Added ability to restart uploads/put() where the previous attempt left off.
  - Added append() command [APPE], it also uses OFFSET, but doesn't send the
    REST command to the server.
  - Added LocalAddr option to new().  Works against both the command channel
    and the data channel.
  - Masks out the user name used when generating a log file.  Similar to how
    this is already done for the password.  Except it must also hide it in the
    response to USER & PASS.  Only masked when written to the log, message()
    and last_message() still returns the user name unmasked in any response
    string!
  - Fixed a bug in t/10-complex.t and added optional environment variables
    for some of the connection values to make it easier for me to quickly
    rerun tests during development without having to key in ansers to questions
    with no good default values over & over again.
  - Wrote t/20-certificate.t to test certificates out.  But this and
    t/10-complex.t are probably incompatable in most settings.  Anyone else
    trying to use this test case will have to modify this code to point to their
    certificate and provide it's password, since I'm not going to publish my
    test client certificate.
  - Calls to command() now return a reference to this class so that you can
    code something like: "if ($ftps->command("NOOP")->response() == CMD_OK)".
    This should be compatible since it shouldn't be called externally, and
    you should always be calling response() afterwards anyway.  It still calls
    die if "Croak=>1" is used.  Response() will return CMD_ERROR should
    command() have issues to avoid hangs.
  - Modifed Net::FTPSSL to use the new command()->response() format internally.

0.17 2011/01/03 08:30:00
  - Fixed a subtle bug in response(), now tests if a parse succeeded instead
    of assuming it.  Allowed me to simplify this messy code quite a bit.
  - Reordered the methods in the POD to put some of the more relevant FTP
    commands closer to the top & the more obscure at the bottom to make
    for easier reading of the documentation.
  - Reworked t/10-complex.t quite a bit.  Made sure croak was always turned
    off immediately after a successful login.  Also now using the same hash
    for all the connection attempts.  I really need to take the time to do
    further redesign this script to make it easier to troubleshoot.
  - Fixed the smoke tester failures.  (They always answer NO to the deeper test)
  - t/10-complex.t now checks if OverridePASV or OverrideHELP are needed against
    the test server & dynamically adds it for the test cases if needed.
    Net::FTPSSL still can't dynamically figure this out for itself.
  - Added PASV/EPSV prompt to t/10-complex.t script instead of assuming PASV.

0.16 2010/11/30 08:30:00
  - Used Perl's special variables to write the Perl verion and OS to the logs
    to make support easier when trouble shooting tickets.
  - Fixes for Bug Id 61432.
  - On systems like "Connect:Enterprise UNIX", it incorrectly sends the
    response to HELP partially in clear text and partially encrypted on the
    command channel.  This causes this class to barf and never recover once it
    hits the clear text.  So a new "OverrideHELP" option was created to bypass
    calls to HELP if your server has this strange behavior.  This is needed
    since HELP is called internally by the Net::FTPSSL class via supported()!
    ** Maybe in the future I'll figure out a way to dynamically handle this. **
  - On some systems the server administrator won't configure their servers
    correctly to use the correct IP Address in the PASV response through a
    firewall when establishing a new Data Channel Connection.  To get arround
    this, a new "OverridePASV" option was created to force the use of the
    Specified Server Name instead of the invalid IP Address returned in the
    PASV response!
    ** Maybe in the future I'll figure out a way to dynamically handle this. **
  - Added "OverridePASV" & "OverrideHELP" test cases to t/10-complex.t
  - Added EPSV support.  Required the reorginization of some internal
    undocumented methods that no one should be using.
  - Added EPSV test to t/10-complex.t

0.15 2010/04/27 08:30:00
  - Fixes for Bug Id 53719.  Requested all internal calls to "ALLO" be
    conditional since some server connections die when it receives an "ALLO"
    command.
  - Fixing the above bug uncovered an infinite loop if Croak was also turned on.
    Now _croak_or_return() doesn't try to close the connection if called by
    command() or response() or if recursion was detected.
  - Fixed quot() to no longer upshift the command to upper case.  Discovered
    case where lower case was required.  So it's now up the the caller to
    put in upper case if it's required!  Also no longer checks if the command
    is valid according to HELP.  Some servers attempt to be sneeky by not
    advertising all available commands.

0.14 2010/01/04 08:30:00
  - Added minimum requirement of IO::Socket::SSL v1.08, since I just got word
    that v0.97 caused Net-FTPSSL to hang!  And v1.08 was the release I
    originally developed Net::FTPSSL with & is easily available for Windows
    users as a pre-built release. But that release is still pretty old.
    (IO::Socket::SSL is currently at v1.31 as of this writting.)
  - Fixed bug in _common_put() where it didn't actually test the final status
    message when closing the data connection.  So missed a rare failure case.
  - Fixed similar bugs in list() & get() as well.
  - Caught more list() & nlst() error conditions that returned undef instead of
    the empty list as documented.
  - Added the Server/Port to start of trace file after the version # since not
    all servers returned this info in their log messagse.

0.13 2009/11/01 08:30:00
  - Decided to skip unlucky release # 13!

0.12 2009/09/29 08:30:00
  - Made some POD changes.
  - Fixed so each class instance has it's own file hande so multiple instances
    won't write to the log file of the last Net::FTPSSL->new() call made with
    Debug turned on.  Also fixed t/10-complex.t to use multiple connections so
    we can manually verify this is finally corrected.
  - Made sure the version of FTPSSL used always gets written out when Debug is
    turned on.  So removed this code from t/10-complex.t as no longer needed.
  - Fixed "quit" to close the DebugLogFile, will write to STDERR if anything
    else is improperly called after "quit" is called!
  - Fixed "put" tie file handle problem from Tkt # 49378.
  - Added mdtm() & mfmt() to follow FTP specs & exposed _mdtm() & _mfmt() in
    the POD text, which uses timestamps instead.  Per request # 49376.  The
    underscore versions are more user friendly.
  - Added size() per request # 49377.
  - Minor fixes to 10-complex.t to support new functionality.
  - Reorged some older code to make it easier to maintain.  Making some blocks
    of code much smaller and less awkward.
  - Fixed xput & xget to delete the dest file before renaming the scratch file.
    Avoids rare file permission issues when the dest file already exists and the
    file recognizer is down.

0.11 2009/07/19 08:30:00
  - Added ccc() to end of 10-complex.t test script.
  - Updated the ccc() docs on issues with older IO::Socket::SSL versions.
  - Provided solution to Tkt # 47659, problems with CCC - RFC 4217 Section 12.3.
    Where CCC behaves differently for different FTPS servers.
  - Added Debug option to allow writing to DebugLogFile in append mode instead
    of creating a new log file every time.  So can use same log file when
    serially making FTPS connections.
  - Now allows overriding of the IMP_CRYPT port 990 to something else.  Found a
    server that allowed me to change the implicit port # for this. Tkt # 46851.

0.10 2009/06/30 08:30:00
  - Updated the Port vs IMP_CRYPT documentation to state you can't override
    port 990 for IMP_CRYPT.  Where before this was just assumed.
  - Added option DebugLogFile to allow you to write your Debug info to a
    file of your choice instead of STDERR.  This way multiple FTPS connections
    can be traced separately of each other.  Also keeps other writes to STDERR
    separate.

0.09 2009/05/13 08:30:00
  - Fixed some typos in the documentation.
  - Fixed so list() & nlst() no longer return undef on some errors instead of
    the empty list as documented.
  - Fixed bug # 45710 where nlst() has issues returning zero rows.
  - Fixed xput() so the scratch file is guaranteed to appear in the same
    directory as the final file unless the prefix overrides it with a directory
    of it's own.  Fixes issue where the remote file wasn't being written to the
    current directory on the remote server and we couldn't write to the current
    directory on that server for the scratch file.
  - Added xget() as the complement to xput().  Where the file recognizer is on
    the client side.
  - Added ccc() for finally supporting the CCC command. (Clear Command Channel)
  - Improved get() logic for removing zero byte files if it can't download the
    requested file.  Still leaves behind partially downloaded files on purpose.
  - Enhanced t/10-complex.t to test new functionality. (But not CCC due to
    security concerns.)
  - Added last_status_code() to return the 1 digit status returned by message()
    so your code can branch on particular issues instead of just pass/fail.

0.08 2009/03/23 08:30:00
  - Fixed new() to also accept a hash reference.  So can do either way now!
    Pass the hash by reference or pass the hash by value.
  - Fixed command() & response() undefined function bug when called by a
    socket data type in new() and a fatal error was encountered.  Solved by
    not calling the member function in the normal way.
  - Added $Net::FTPSSL::ERRSTR to give you access to the error messages
    generated when you couldn't create a Net::FTPSSL object via new().  Also
    set when Croak is called even though you had the special perl variable $@
    for this. It is also printed to STDERR when Debug is turned on.
  - Fixed response() case where the ending message had CR's in it and it was
    being truncated.
  - Fixed response() to detect unexpected EOF: Bug # 43670.
  - Now passes Timeout to start_SSL() calls in new().
  - Added plain old FTP as option CLR_CRYPT.  Just avoids encrypting the
    command channel.  Still doesn't support the CCC command.
  - Fixed implicit problem.  Turned out to be a bug in choosing the "default"
    port as well as reading the response to soon. Bug # 28914.
  - Exposed all the FTP CMD status constants for public use.
  - Added unsupported option SSL_Advanced for Enhancement Request # 44042.
    Use at your own risk!  It's not supported by the developer of Net::FTPSSL.
  - Enhanced t/10-complex.t to print the version of Net-FTPSSL being tested and
    support/test the new functionality.  Also now generates a backup copy of
    the trace log named after the options selected to ease testing of multiple
    configurations.
  - Added xput for avoiding file recognizer issues on the FTPS server side
    during file transfers.  IE the file recognizer picks the file up before the
    transfer completes.  After the rename the file recognizer can safely assume
    the file transfer has completed without issues.
  - Added option in new() to support preserving the timestamps on files
    transfered between the client & server via get(), put(), uput() & xput().
    Works providing the FTPS server supports this functionality.
  - Fixed response() timing bug where sysread() sometimes read the results of
    multiple commands.  Ex: the 150 INFO msg for opening the data connection and
    the 226 transfer complete message.  This bug caused FTPSSL to randomly hang
    when connected to some servers.
  - Fixed bug where nlst() hung if it returned zero rows on some servers.
  - Removed total from list() since it wasn't always present for all servers
    and it was the total block size, not the total # of files or bytes returned.
  - Fixed list() & nlst() to allow wildcard filters similar to unix "ls" cmd.
    The only wildcards being "*" or "?".

0.07 2009/02/24 08:30:00
  - Corrected some typos in the documentation.
  - Implemented call back functionality for all data channel functions.
  - Fixed uput() to return the file name used on success instead of just
    true/false.   Will still return "undef" on failure.  Needed in order to
    figure out what the other server actually called the file we sent it.
  - Exposed the DataProtLevel constants for public use.
  - Added callback feature for all data channel FTP functions.
  - Now uses caller() extensively to combine multiple similar functions together
    and for callback support.
  - Another fix to the get() bug introduced by the Bug 17537 fix.  The previous
    attempt in v0.06 didn't fully fix the problem!  So took different approach.
  - Enhanced t/10-complex.t & t/00-basic.t

  The following changes may break some existing code ...
  - Added new option 'Croak' to cause all failures to call croak() instead of
    returning undef.  This caused some minor incompatabilities on error handling
    if your code depended on some old croak() calls.  But the new code is now
    consistant in error handling in either always returning failure or always
    calling croak!  It no longer does a combination of both.
  - Added set_croak() to help mitigate above issue, by being able to turn the
    croak feature on & off.  t/10-complex.t uses this logic while initializing
    the connection.
  - user() & password() have been renamed since internal functions.

0.06 2009/02/03 08:30:00
  - Added new() DataProtLevel option to allow selecting the Data Channel
    Protection.
  - Fixed _help() so supported() works for some new servers.
  - new() now allows you to select SSL over TLS for connections via useSSL.
  - Fixed get() bug that sometimes added extra \015 to ASCII files downloaded.
    Introduced when Bug 17537 was fixed.
  - Enhanced t/10-complex.t

0.05 2009/01/05 08:30:00
  - Fixed resonse() to properly get the entire response instead of just the 1st
    line of it.  This change fixes many of the reported bugs reported against
    this module.
  - Fixed command() & response() to also log socket() calls in debug mode with
    "SKT >>>" & "SKT <<<" prefixes.
  - Added supported(), quot(), & _help()
  - All response calls in new() are now tested & added debug flag to socket
    object.
  - Enhanced t/10-complex.t
  - Other minor fixes.
  - Bugs Fixed: 41665, 31720, 16751, 30359, 24136, 17537, 17538, 34818
