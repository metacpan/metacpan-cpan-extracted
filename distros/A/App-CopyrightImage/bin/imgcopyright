=head1 SYNOPSYS

Modified copy of images will be placed into a new C<ci> directory within the
directory you specify. If no directory is specified, we'll create it in the
current working directory. All new images will be prefixed with C<ci_>.

    # set copyright

    imgcopyright -i picture.jpg -n "Steve Bertrand" -e "steveb@cpan.org"

    # all pics in a directory

    imgcopyright -i /home/user/Pictures -n "Steve Bertrand"

    # find images without copyright info

    imgcopyright -i /home/user/Pictures -c

    # specify an alternate output directory

    imgcopyright -i /home/user/Pictures -n "steve" -d ~/mypics

    # replace a previous copyright

    imgcopyright -i picture.jpg -n "steve" -f

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This C<imgcopyright> application allows you to add copyright information to
the EXIF data within image files. It also allows you to check images for
missing copyright info and remove info.

It works on individual files, as well as recurses (top-level only) of a
supplied directory.

It does NOT modify the original file (except for C<remove>). We create a 
subdirectory named C<ci> in whatever path you specify (current working directory
if a path is not sent in), and we then take a copy of each original file, modify
it, prefix the filename with a C<ci_>, and place it into the new C<ci> 
directory.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

=head2 -i, --image

Mandatory in all cases.

Name of a single image file, or a directory containing image files. In the case
of a directory, we'll iterate over the top level, and work on all image files
found.

=head2 -n, --name

Mandatory, unless using C<--check>.

This is the name that will be used in the copyright string for the C<Copyright>
EXIF tag, as well as the C<Creator> tag.

=head2 -e, --email

Optional.

This is appended to the C<--name> when populating the C<Creator> EXIF tag if
it is sent in.

=head2 -c, --check

Optional.

Checks for missing C<Copyright> and/or C<Creator> EXIF tags in the image(s)
sent in with the C<--image> option.

=head2 -d, --dst

Optional.

By default, we use the directory sent in with C<--image> (current working
directory if a path isn't provided), and put all modified images in a new C<ci>
directory under it. 

Send in a directory path with this option and we'll put the image files there
instead.

=head2 -r, --remove

Optional.

WARNING: This option DOES edit the original file, and does NOT make a copy
first.

Removes copyright EXIF information for files sent in with C<--image>.

=head2 -f, --force

By default, if an image already has EXIF copyright information, we skip
over it and do nothing. Set this option to overwrite any found copyright
info.
