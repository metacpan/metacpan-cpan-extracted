Dancer2::Template::Obj2HTML - Templating system based on HTML::Obj2HTML

=head1 SYNOPSYS

In your config.yml

    engines:
      template:
        Obj2HTML:
          page_loc: "dofiles/pages"
          component_loc: "dofiles/components"
          template_loc: "dofiles/templates"
          extension: ".view"

In your router:

    template \@content;
    template path/to/file

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Templating system for Dancer2 using HTML::Obj2HTML, primarily intended as the
target templating system for Dancer2::Plugin::DoFile

There is very little logic behind this templating system, aside processing
the templates as Obj2HTML content (i.e. array and hash references that define
the HTML in an easily manipulatable way).

Note that the default location for files is in "dofiles/", not "layouts/", but
a simple configuration change will fix that for you, if that's what you want to
do. The reason WHY it's "dofiles/" is simply to keep together all the
Plugin::DoFile and Template::Obj2HTML assets.
