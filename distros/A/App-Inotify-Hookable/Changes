Revision history for App::Inotify::Hookable

0.09 2016-02-15 20:33:43

    - I forgot to write a changelog for 0.08, this release is
      identical to it except I'm now updating the Changes file:

    - Fixed a common race condition bug where inotify-hookable would
      just plain die if a directory it tried to watch had been deleted
      (happens e.g. in the middle of "git checkout").

      Now we just ignore that and move on, before the whola watcher
      would just stop.

    - Use find(1) again instead of File::Find::Rule, it's noticably
      faster and there's no point in this module being non-POSIX
      postable since it relies on a Linux-specific facility.

0.06 2012-12-21 15:36:41

    - Unbreak the ignoring of paths with ".git" in them (to not fire
      on git operations) broken in 0.04.

    - Print the number of added/removed/replaced watches when things
      change and show how long it took to do that.

    - Fix undefined behavior to be defined.

    - Fix feature for removing stale watches that never worked.

    - Stop re-adding watches for paths that already have a watch.
