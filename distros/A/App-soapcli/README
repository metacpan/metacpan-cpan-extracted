    which contains data in JSON or YAML format.

    The second argument is an URL address to WSDL data or a filename of
    WSDL data file or a file which contains an URL address to WSDL data.
    This filename is optional and can be guessed from first argument.

    The third argument is an URL address of endpoint with a name of a
    webservice port. The URL address of endpoint is optional if is already
    a part of WSDL data. The name of port is optional if it is unambiguous
    for called method. The name of port should start with # character.

    The fourth argument is a name of method. It is optional if a name of
    method is already a part of request data.

    The result will be dumped as JSON (by default) or YAML.
