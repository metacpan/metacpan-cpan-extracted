NAME
    Module::Install::CPANfile - Include cpanfile

SYNOPSIS
      # cpanfile
      requires 'Plack', 0.9;
      on test => sub {
          requires 'Test::Warn';
      };

      # Makefile.PL
      use inc::Module::Install;
      name 'Dist-Name';
      all_from 'lib/Dist/Name.pm';
      # ...
      cpanfile;
      WriteAll;

DESCRIPTION
    Module::Install::CPANfile is a plugin for Module::Install to include
    dependencies from cpanfile into meta files. "MYMETA" files are always
    merged with cpanfile, as well as "META" files when you run "Makefile.PL"
    as an author mode (as in preparation for "make dist").

WHY?
    If you have read cpanfile and cpanfile-faq you might wonder why this
    plugin is necessary, since *cpanfile* is meant to be used by Perl
    applications and not distributions.

    Well, for a couple reasons.

  Co-exist as a Github project and CPAN distribution
    One particular use case is a script or web application that you develop
    on github, and you start with writing dependencies in *cpanfile*. Other
    users or developers pull the code from git, use carton to bundle
    dependencies. So far, so good.

    One day you decide to release the script or application to CPAN as a
    CPAN distribtuion, and that means you have to duplicate *cpanfile* into
    *Makefile.PL* or *Build.PL*, and that's not DRY! This plugin will allow
    you to have just one *cpanfile* and reuse it from *Makefile.PL* for CPAN
    client use.

  CPAN Meta Spec 2.0 support.
    The other, kind of unfortunate reason is that as of this writing,
    Module::Install and ExtUtils::MakeMaker don't have a complete support
    for expressing CPAN::Meta::Spec version 2.0 vocabularies.

    There are many of known issues that the metadata you specify with
    Module::Install are somehow discarded or down converted, and eventually
    lost in *MYMETA* files. The examples of those issues are that test
    dependencies gets merged with build dependencies, and that *recommends*
    is not saved into MYMETA files.

    This plugin lets you write prerequisites in *cpanfile* which is more
    powerful and has a complete support for CPAN::Meta::Spec 2.0 and makes
    your application forward compatible.
