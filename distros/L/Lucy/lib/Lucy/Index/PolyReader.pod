=head1 NAME

Lucy::Index::PolyReader - Multi-segment implementation of IndexReader.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $polyreader = Lucy::Index::IndexReader->open( 
        index => '/path/to/index',
    );
    my $doc_reader = $polyreader->obtain("Lucy::Index::DocReader");
    for my $doc_id ( 1 .. $polyreader->doc_max ) {
        my $doc = $doc_reader->fetch_doc($doc_id);
        print " $doc_id: $doc->{title}\n";
    }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

PolyReader conflates index data from multiple segments.  For instance, if
an index contains three segments with 10 documents each, PolyReader’s
L<doc_max()|Lucy::Index::IndexReader/doc_max> method will return 30.

Some of PolyReader’s L<DataReader|Lucy::Index::DataReader> components
may be less efficient or complete than the single-segment implementations
accessed via L<SegReader|Lucy::Index::SegReader>.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 doc_max

    my $int = $poly_reader->doc_max();

Return the maximum number of documents available to the reader, which
is also the highest possible internal document id.  Documents which
have been marked as deleted but not yet purged from the index are
included in this count.

=head2 doc_count

    my $int = $poly_reader->doc_count();

Return the number of documents available to the reader, subtracting
any that are marked as deleted.

=head2 del_count

    my $int = $poly_reader->del_count();

Return the number of documents which have been marked as deleted but
not yet purged from the index.

=head2 offsets

    my $i32_array = $poly_reader->offsets();

Return an array with one entry for each segment, corresponding to
segment doc_id start offset.

=head2 seg_readers

    my $arrayref = $poly_reader->seg_readers();

Return an array of all the SegReaders represented within the
IndexReader.

=head1 INHERITANCE

Lucy::Index::PolyReader isa L<Lucy::Index::IndexReader> isa L<Lucy::Index::DataReader> isa Clownfish::Obj.
