It is not recommended that you amend the supplied templates - they
contain logic and therefore can have bugs, they may have new features
added in the future and so on.

From OpenGuides 0.41, some of the supplied templates will optionally
call out to other template fragments that you can put in a custom template
path (by default custom-templates/). If custom templates do not exist then
sensible default wording will be used instead.

The names of all custom templates will be prefixed with custom_.

The custom templates currently supported are:

 - custom_header.tt
   Will be included at the very end of the <head> element on every page.

 - custom_licence.tt
   Will be included at the top of the page editing form.

 - custom_footer_credits.tt
   Will be included in a <div id="footer"> at the base of every page.
   You may wish to take advantage of the supplied TT variables
     - [% delete_link %]
       Will supply a link to delete the page, if and only if your
       wiki.conf has deletion turned on.
     - [% openguides_version %]
       Contains the version of OpenGuides that your site is running on.

 - custom_banner.tt
   Will be included in a <div id="banner"> at the top of every page.
   You may wish to take advantage of the supplied TT variables
    - [% site_name %]
      Contains the value supplied in wiki.conf as the name of the site.

 - custom_node.tt
   Will be included just below the main wiki content in node.tt.

 - custom_autocreate_content.tt
   You can control the text that gets put into the content field of any
   autocreated category/locale nodes by putting it in this template.
   The following TT variables will be available to the template:
     - [% index_type %]
       e.g. "Category" - note that the first letter is capitalised
     - [% index_value %]
       e.g. "Vegan-friendly" - capitalisation just as typed in the edit form
     - [% node_name %]
       e.g. "Category Vegan-Friendly" - the full, "official" name of the
       autocreated node

 - custom_auto_map_link.tt
   Used to include map links. The TT variable map_link will contain the
   map link from the node data, which you may wish to display. If the
   template is being called from within an address class, the
   auto_map_link_in_address TT variable will be set.
   Note: at least one of phone, fax, address, postcode, website,
         hours_text, map_link is required for this hook to be called,
         but you should not rely on this behaviour.

- custom_node_location_search.tt
  Used to add more location based searches on a node page for example nearest
  tube station. Located after the find all things within * of here form.

Requests for further custom inserts are welcomed.

If you include your own versions of other (non custom_) templates in
custom-templates they will override the installed files, and this may
cause you problems. We would much rather that you let us know what we could
do to make your customisations possible within custom_ templates.
