0.540   2019-05-12  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- Complain when dist.ini specifies perl version but source code

	- [dist] Fix expressing follow-spec prereq relationship with
	  x_spec.


0.50    2016-12-27  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- [Bugfix] Properly handle extra relationship prefix (_EMBED::,
	  ...).

	- [dist] Moving spec prereq from DevelopRecommends to
	  DevelopSuggests with _SPEC:: prefix.


0.49    2016-12-27  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- Aside from _EMBED, disregard the other extra relationships.


0.48    2016-12-27  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	  in DevelopSuggests dependency, e.g. _SPEC::Rinci, _EMBED::*.


0.47    2016-11-25  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- No functional changes.

	- [ux] When fixing, put DONE/FAILED messages at the beginning of
	  the remedy to make them stand out more.


0.46    2016-09-17  Released-By: PERLANCAR

        - No functional changes.

        - Release to test Markdown->POD formatting.


0.45    2016-08-04  Released-By: PERLANCAR

        - Add support for Perl::PrereqScanner::NotQuiteLite. To select this
          scanner, use --scanner=nqlite. Currently, both 'suggests' and
          'requires' from the scanning result are added as 'requires'.

        - Deprecate --lite option and replace it with --scanner. The default is
          still Perl::PrereqScanner ('regular'). Other possible values are
          'lite' (Perl::PrereqScanner::Lite) and 'nqlite' mentioned in the
          previous point.

        - Perl::PrereqScanner::Lite is downgraded as RuntimeRecommends prereq,
          as is Perl::PrereqScanner::NotQuiteLite.


0.44    2016-08-03  Released-By: PERLANCAR

        - Add options --extra-runtime-dirs, --extra-test-dirs.

        - Add "." (curdir) into config_dirs, so we can easily customize on a
          per-distro basis.


0.43    2016-06-09  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- When adding missing prereq, check minimum version in [versions]
	  and use it.


0.42    2016-06-03  Released-By: PERLANCAR

        - Allow specifying minimum version of modules in [versions] of
          lint-prereqs.conf.


0.41    2016-03-17  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- Change backup dist.ini from dist.ini.bak to dist.ini~.


0.40    2016-03-13  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- Recognize test modules from same dist (in t/lib/).


0.39    2016-03-04  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- Add --fix option.


0.38    2016-03-01  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- [Bugfix] Checking for duplicate prereq shouldn't be done using
	  Config::IOD's allow_duplicate_key=0 because that will disallow
	  duplicate key in all sections, not just prereq sections.


0.37    2016-03-01  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- [Enhancement] Check some misplaced phase cases: 1) prereqs used only
          in tests (t/, xt/) must be put in Test prereqs in dist.ini and not in
          [Prereqs / Runtime*]; 2) prereqs used in test as well as runtime must
          be put in Runtime prereqs and not in [Prereqs / Test*]. This will be
          useful when CPAN clients want to skip installing test-only
          prerequisites (e.g. because user runs "cpanm -n" instead of "cpanm").

        - [Removed] Remove 'allow-core' feature to simplify stuffs. You either
          need to specify core prereqs (if `core_prereqs` option is enabled, the
          default) or are not allowed to specify core prereqs (if `core_prereqs`
          option is disabled).

        - [Incompatible change] For safety, switch back default scanner to
          Perl::PrereqScanner (::Lite still misses/misdetects sometimes).


0.36    2016-02-27  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- [Internal] Switch from using Config::IniFiles to Config::IOD.

        - Disallow duplicate prereq.


0.35    2016-02-27  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- [ux] Sort result by module name (a la PERLANCAR: perl, then
	  pragmas, then modules).


0.34    2016-02-04  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- [Incompatible change] Set default --core-prereqs to 1.


0.33    2016-01-29  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- Show requested version (req_v) and is_core fields in result.

	- Add option: --core-prereqs to require core modules to be listed
	  just like non-core modules.

	- Bump prereq version Log::Any::IfLOG to 0.07.


0.32    2015-10-18  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- Add directive argument: allow-core.


0.31    2015-08-31  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- [Bugfix] Don't explode when there is no t/.


0.30    2015-08-18  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- Re-tweak: also check *.pl & *.pm files in t/ and xt/.


0.29    2015-08-18  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- Only include *.t for files in t/ and xt/.


0.28    2015-08-18  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- Tweak regex to allow ;!(no-)?lint-prereqs as well as
	  ;!(no_)?lint_prereqs.


0.27    2015-08-17  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- No functional changes.

	- Switch from Log::Any to Log::Any::IfLOG.


0.26    2015-05-15  Released-By: PERLANCAR

        - Support lumped modules (see Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Lump for more
          details).

        - Observe ';!no-lint-prereqs' directive.

        - Replace detecting core module from using 'corelist -v' to using
          Module::CoreList::More->is_still_core to handle modules that were once
          in core but removed later.


0.25    2015-04-11  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- Replace detecting core module from using 'corelist -v' to using
	  Module::CoreList::More->is_still_core to handle modules that were
	  once in core but removed later.


0.24    2015-03-10  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- Change result metadata 'result_format_options' ->
	  'cmdline.format_options'.


0.23    2015-02-24  Released-By: PERLANCAR

        - [Bugfix] Rebuild to use Perinci::CmdLine::Lite backend by default.

        - [Bugfix] Allow --nolite since --lite is now on by default.

        - [Bugfix] [dzil] Make Perl::PrereqScanner::Lite a requires prereq and
          not recommends.


0.22    2015-02-24  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- Try once again using --lite by default.

	- Add extra scanner Moose & Version for Lite (ref:
	  https://github.com/moznion/Perl-PrereqScanner-Lite/issues/8).


0.21    2015-01-04  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- Revert back to using Perl::PrereqScanner by default (due to
	  ::Lite still misses detecting some modules), but offer --lite to
	  switch to ::Lite.


0.20    2015-01-04  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- Skip scanning backup files.


0.19    2015-01-04  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- Replace Perl::PrereqScanner with Perl::PrereqScanner::Lite for
	  performance.


0.18    2014-12-18  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- No functional changes.

	- [Bugfix] Regression: section regex didn't match 'Prereqs /
	  Something' while it used to.


0.17    2014-12-18  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- Also look at OSPrereqs (and OSPrereqs::*) for prereqs.


0.16     2014-08-16  Released-By: SHARYANTO; Note: Happy 19th CPAN Day!

         - [build] CLI scripts are now generated automatically using
           Dist::Zilla::Plugin::ScriptFromFunc. The plugin is still at 0.01 so the
           generated script is not as polished as it should be. Stay tuned.


0.15     2014-07-22  Released-By: SHARYANTO

         - No functional changes.

         - Switch CLI scripts from using Perinci::CmdLine to
           Perinci::CmdLine::Any to reduce size of dependencies.


0.14    2014-03-08  Released-By: SHARYANTO

	- No functional changes. Rebuild with Rinci::Wrap to test embedding
          wrapper code.


0.13    2013-11-12  Released-By: SHARYANTO

	- No functional changes. Rebuild to fix t/00-compile.t generated by
	  older DZP::Test::Compile (2.019 < x < 2.033).


0.12    2013-09-26  Released-By: SHARYANTO

        - For core modules, compare version from scanned vs version in core
          modules (e.g. Test::More is 0.92 in perl 5.10.1, if test script says
          'use Test::More 0.98' we should fail).

        - Tweak outputs and error messages.


0.11    2013-03-11  Released-By: SHARYANTO

        - Allow version mismatch if dist.ini specifies a version but
          scan_prereqs specifies 0 (e.g. 'require Foo' in code, because require
          doesn't allow specifying minimum version).


0.10    2013-03-10  Released-By: SHARYANTO

        [INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES]

        - Replace 'default_perl_version' argument with 'perl_version', takes
          precedence over perl version from dist.ini or scan_prereqs.

        - Force versions in dist.ini and scan_prereqs to match.


0.09    2012-10-17  Released-By: SHARYANTO

        - Fix handling of single-word package name (e.g. Gepok).


0.08    2012-10-04  Released-By: SHARYANTO

        - No functional changes. Check perl version and the success status of
          corelist. Tweak error message.

        [ENHANCEMENTS]

        - Read '!lint-prereqs assume-used' directive in comment, to avoid having
          to listing modules again in [Extras / lint-prereqs / assume-used]
          section.
