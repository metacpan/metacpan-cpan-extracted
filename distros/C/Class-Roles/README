BASICS
------

Class::Roles provides a role-based system of object-oriented programming.
Either install the module and use the command:

	$ perldoc Class::Roles

or use this command (with pathnames changed to fit the perversions of your
favored operating system):

	$ perldoc lib/Class/Roles.pm

or, if you're heroic and can read raw POD in situ, open the module above in
your favorite text editor.  Let it not be said that you are bereft of choice.


INSTALLATION
------------

Use Module::Build.  It's quite handy:

	$ perl Build.PL
	$ ./Build
	$ ./Build test
	$ sudo ./Build install

Again, season to taste to match your desired shell, your paths, and whatever
invocation grants you root-like powers on your computer as necessary.
