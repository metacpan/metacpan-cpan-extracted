DESCRIPTION

Mail::Cclient gives access to mailboxes in many different formats
(including remote IMAP folders) via the c-client API. The c-client
library is the core library used by Pine and the University of
Washington IMAP daemon (written by Mark Crispin).

INSTALLATION

Install the University of Washington imapd source distribution
(e.g. version imap-2000) and build at least the c-client library
(c-client/c-client.a). The home site for the UW imapd is
    ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/mail/imap-2000.tar.Z

If your platform needs any additional LIBS entries, edit Makefile.PL
and add them. Do
    perl Makefile.PL CCLIENT_DIR=/path/to/c-client
where /path/to/c-client is the pathname of the directory which contains
the c-client.a archive library which you have just built. If you want
to add any additional MakeMaker options then add them after the
CCLIENT_DIR=... argument, not before.

This process needs to extract all object files from the c-client.a
archive into the current directory. This is for the sake of those
platforms which require an explicit list of object files for creating
shared objects rather than a mix of .o and .a files. If the extraction
succeeds, it will say so and you can carry on and do

    make

If the extraction failed for some reason, you will have to do that
part yourself and then replace that part of MakeMaker with a simple
assignment to @objects of the object files in your c-client.a.

Once the extension has been built, you can do

    make install

to complete the installation.

DOCUMENTATION

Cclient.pm includes fairly complete documentation which the
build/installation process will turn into a man page. You may also
want to read the $CCLIENT_DIR/docs/Internal.doc which documents the
underlying c-client library. However, that documentation is at odds
with the actual code in a few places.
