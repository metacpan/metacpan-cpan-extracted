Revision history for Perl extension CatalystX-Crudite

0.21  2014-01-16 17:55:14 CET
    [Improvements]
        - share/templates/crudite_config: Datatable columns whose title is the
          empty string aren't searchable or sortable; use those for columns
          with action buttons. You can have several of those; previously the
          title had to be "Actions", which looks strange if you have several
          such columns. And it's clear from the buttons in those columns that
          they produce some sort of action.
        - Also, datatable columns whose title is '*hidden' are hidden.

0.16 Sat May 18 12:08:57 2013 CEST
    [Improvements]
        - Give the user more freedom over his layout: The TT view doesn't
          mandate wrapper.tt and the login form is rendered as a template as
          well, so you need to provide your own login/login.tt
