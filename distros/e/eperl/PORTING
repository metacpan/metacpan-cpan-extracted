  ePerl was written with portability in mind. Additionally to overcome the
  system dependend characteristics ePerl uses a GNU autoconf based
  configuration scheme which tries hard to determine the information both from
  the installed Perl interpreter and from scratch via own GNU autoconf tests.

  So ePerl already compiles out-of-the-box on a lot of systems. At least the
  following Unix/Compiler/Perl variants were sucessfully tested by the author
  in the past:

  If your Unix derivate is not on this list, don't panic. As we said, ePerl
  tries to determine the information itself, so there is a good chance that
  ePerl finds alternatives even for your system. At least for the compilation
  ePerl does a trick: It don't tries to find a reasonable compiler and
  reasonable flags for it. Instead it uses the one your Perl interpreter was
  compiled with. Because the Perl 5 Porters already tried hard to determine
  the best combination, so ePerl can only benefit from it.

  If it still fails to compile or run, first try to see where the problem
  resides. Usually problems can occur when you are using a brain-dead compiler
  or a too old Perl version. Try to upgrade or use better variants.  One
  important case: Because ePerl wants to build itself the same way the Perl
  interpreter was compiled, this can cause problems on systems which have a
  binary package of a pre-built Perl system installed.  Here you can only
  build ePerl without problems when your system has the same compiler, headers
  and libraries available as the package builder's one had. If this not an
  option for you try to find a ePerl binary package the same way you found the
  Perl binary package.
