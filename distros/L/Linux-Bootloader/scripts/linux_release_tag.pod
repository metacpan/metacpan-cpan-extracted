=head1 NAME

linux_release_tag - prints kernel version of a Linux kernel Makefile

=head1 SYNOPSIS

linux_release_tag [ MAKEFILE ] [ FORMAT ]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This script extracts the version information from a Linux kernel
makefile and prints it according to the format specification indicated
by FORMAT (which, by default, prints something in the form of
'2.6.24-rc13-git42'.)

MAKEFILE must be a path to a valid kernel Makefile.  If not specified,
it defaults to /usr/src/linux/Makefile.

FORMAT is a string containing one or more of the following tags, which
are substituted by the relevant items from the kernel makefile:

  %v - VERSION
  %p - PATCHLEVEL
  %s - SUBLEVEL
  %e - EXTRAVERSION
  %n - NAME

If not specified, FORMAT defaults to "%v.%p.%s%e".
