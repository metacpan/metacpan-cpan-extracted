NAME
    App::cpanchanges - Look up and display change logs of CPAN releases

SYNOPSIS
        cpanchanges Moose
        cpanchanges LWP::UserAgent
        cpanchanges --distribution libwww-perl
        cpanchanges --help

DESCRIPTION
    App::cpanchanges looks up release change logs from MetaCPAN
    <https://metacpan.org>'s API and displays them to you in your terminal.
    Think of it as perldoc or cpandoc for change logs.

    By default it expects a module name which it maps to the latest release
    ("AUTHOR/Release-Name-VERSION") and then looks up the changes file for
    that release.

    App::cpanchanges is simply a package placeholder for the included
    cpanchanges script. The (currently very tiny) guts of the script may be
    librarized in the future, but they're very simple right now.
