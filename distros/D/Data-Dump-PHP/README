NAME
    Data::Dump::PHP - Pretty printing of data structures as PHP code

VERSION
    version 0.10

SYNOPSIS
     use Data::Dump::PHP qw(dump_php ddx_php);

     # in Perl
     $str = dump_php($var);
     $str2 = dump_php(@list);

     # in PHP
     $var = eval("return $str;");
     $array = eval("return $str2;");

     # or use it for easy debug printout
     ddx_php localtime;

DESCRIPTION
    This module provide functions that takes a list of values as their
    argument and produces a string as its result. The string contains PHP
    code that, when "eval"ed, produces a deep copy of the original
    arguments.

    The main feature of the module is that it strives to produce output that
    is easy to read. Example:

        @a = (1, [2, 3], {4 => 5});
        dump_php(@a);

    Produces:

        array(1, array(2, 3), array( 4 => 5 ))

    If you dump just a little data, it is output on a single line. If you
    dump data that is more complex or there is a lot of it, line breaks are
    automatically added to keep it easy to read.

    The following functions are provided (only the dd* functions are
    exported by default):

    dump_php( ... )
    pp_php( ... )
        Returns a string containing a PHP expression/code. If you pass this
        string to PHP's built-in eval() function like this: eval("return
        $res;") or eval("\$a = $res;"), it should return a copy of the
        arguments you passed to dump_php().

        If you call the function with multiple arguments then the output
        will be wrapped in an outer array "array( ..., ... )". If you call
        the function with a single argument the output will not have the
        wrapping. If you call the function with a single scalar
        (non-reference) argument it will just return the scalar quoted if
        needed, but never break it into multiple lines. If you pass multiple
        arguments or references to arrays of hashes then the return value
        might contain line breaks to format it for easier reading. The
        returned string will never be "\n" terminated, even if contains
        multiple lines. This allows PHP code like this to place the
        semicolon in the expected place:

           echo print '$obj = ', dump_php($obj), ";\n";

        If dump_php() is called in void context, then the dump is printed on
        STDERR and then "\n" terminated. You might find this useful for
        quick debug printouts, but the dd*() functions might be better
        alternatives for this.

        There is no difference between dump_php() and pp_php().

    quote_php( $string )
        Returns a quoted version of the provided string.

        It differs from "dd_php($string)" in that it will quote even numbers
        and not try to come up with clever expressions that might shorten
        the output.

    dd_php( ... )
    ddx_php( ... )
        These functions will call dump_php() on their argument and print the
        result to STDOUT (actually, it's the currently selected output
        handle, but STDOUT is the default for that).

        The difference between them is only that ddx_php() will prefix the
        lines it prints with "# " and mark the first line with the file and
        line number where it was called. This is meant to be useful for
        debug printouts of state within programs.

FUNCTIONS
    None are exported by default, but they are exportable.

OPTIONS
    $Data::Dump::PHP::USE_LAMBDA (default 0) can be set to 1 to generate PHP
    code that uses lambda functions instead of create_function(), which is
    nicer and faster but requires PHP 5.3 or later.

LIMITATIONS
    Code references will be displayed as simply "create_function('', '')"
    (or "function(){}}") when dumped. Thus, "eval"ing them will not
    reproduce the original routine.

    Regex objects in Perl will become string in PHP. If you want to use this
    string in PHP's PCRE functions, you need to make sure that the regex
    will be compatible.

SEE ALSO
    Data::Dump (from which this codebase is based)

    PHP::Var (I tried this first before hacking up Data::Dump::PHP, but it
    has bugs, doesn't do scalars, and doesn't handle recursion.)

    JSON, YAML - Another alternative to exchange data with PHP (and other
    languages) is to export/import via YAML and JSON.

    PHP::Serializer - Yet another way to exchange data with PHP using PHP
    serialization format.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
    Data::Dump::PHP is a quick hack (as I needed it for
    Data::Schema::Emitter::PHP). I simply copied the code from Gisle Ass'
    wonderful "Data::Dump" and changed only whatever is necessary.
