=head1 NAME

DBGp::Client::Response - documentation for DBGp response objects

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Brief description of all possible response objects; they are thin
wrappers around the XML returned by the DBGp client, you should refer
to the L<DBGp protocol specification|http://xdebug.org/docs-dbgp.php>
for the meaning of the various values.

Unless specified, the values returned by the various accessors is the
raw value provided by the debugger.

All responses, except for L</init>, L</stream> and L<notify>
have C<transaction_id> and C<command> accessors.

All response objects have an C<is_error> accessor, which only returns
true for L<error> responses; C<is_internal_error> returns true for
error responses coming from the debugger (for example for a broken
connection).
