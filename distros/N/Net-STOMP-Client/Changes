1.1	Fri Jun 24 2011
	* Net::STOMP::Client::Frame: added a body_reference() method

	* Greatly improved the overall performance (~4 times faster),
	  mainly by reducing string copies, improving frame parsing
	  and minimizing syscalls in the I/O layer.

0.9.4	Wed Oct  6 2010
	* Added STOMP 1.1 support (experimental).

	  compatible with STOMP 1.1
	* Added Net::STOMP::Client::Peer to keep track of peer information.
	* Added Net::STOMP::Client::Protocol to isolate protocol information.
	* Added more tests, some optionally using a broker connection.
	* Improved the documentation.

0.9.3	Tue Jul 20 2010
	* Rewrote the I/O layer to make it more robust.

0.9.2	Mon Jun  7 2010
	* The timeout option now allows the control of different operations
	  (such as waiting for the initial CONNECTED frame or waiting to
	  be able to send an outgoing frame) independently.
	* Added some UTF-8 support, see the Net::STOMP::Client::Frame
	  module documentation for more information.

0.9.1	Tue Jun  1 2010
	* Now performs a better socket cleanup when disconnecting.
	* Net::STOMP::Client->wait_for_frames() now handles more precisely
	  the timeout option: if integer, it should wait for at least this
	  number of seconds and should not block for more than this number
	  of seconds plus one.
	* All STOMP methods now support a timeout option that specifies the
	  maximum time that can be used to send the frame.

0.9	Mon Mar 29 2010
	* Net::STOMP::Client::Frame is now less strict about header names.
	* Net::STOMP::Client->new() now uses its timeout option to set the

0.8	Mon Mar  1 2010
	* This module has been initially released on CPAN as Net::STOMP
	  but has later been renamed to Net::STOMP::Client to avoid a
