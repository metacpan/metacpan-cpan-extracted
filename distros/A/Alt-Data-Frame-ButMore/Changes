Revision history of Alt-Data-Frame-ButMore

0.0043      2019-04-14
    - Breaking change: Dropped the number_of_rows() method for PDL and row
      names. It becomes redundant as we have a role to add length() method to
      PDL. The removal also helps reduce one dependency of the distributon.
    - PDL::SV: Fixed "uniq" method, added new override methods "set" and
      "sever". Also PDL::SV's doc is briefly written.
    - Add a "summary" method to Data::Frame.
    - Add "iris" example data set to Data::Frame::Examples.
    - Restructured main module doc.
    - Solved a circular use issue between Data::Frame and Data::Frame::Util.
    - Switched from Test::More/Test::Most/Test::Fatal/etc to Test2::V0 for
      testing.
