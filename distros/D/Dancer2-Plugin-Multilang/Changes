1.2.0
=====

__Sat Oct 30 2016__

* Config option 'no_lang_prefix' to define a path without any language
change.
* Force redirect with code 307 to allow other types of method
redirection. Now it's possible to redirect POST with the
multilanguage processing.
* Create SEO headers even if the app has layouts turn off - to use
Template Toolkit variables and functions. Changed the hook
'after_layout_render' to 'after'.

All of this thanks to biafra
