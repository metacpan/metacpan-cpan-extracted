0.421   Fri  23 Sept, 2005 23:05
        - more compact output of multiple items in a table cell

0.42    Tues 20 Sept, 2005 09:50
        - provide orderby_link() as a public method, factored out of 
            _make_linked_headers() (Ron McClain). 

0.41    Tues 23 August, 2005 12:00
        - setup() dies if M::P::LinkTools isn't loaded (otherwise the error messages 
            at runtime can be confusing/absent) (Dave Howorth)
        - fix tabulate() for the case of a search returning no results - use $r->model_class 
            instead of ref $objects[0]
            
0.4     Fri  12 Aug 2005, 17:30
        - removed link-generating methods, and re-packaged in Maypole::Plugin::LinkTools
        - added Maypole::Plugin::LinkTools as a dependency
        - extracts field list from the object being processed, rather than the request's 
            model class
        - refactored header link generating code into a separate method

0.322   Tues 9 Aug  2005, 1:20
        - added use URI (spotted by Dave Howorth)

0.321  Thur 4  Aug 2005, 17:10
        - tabulate() now uses the plural_moniker() of related (i.e. has_many) fields 
            when generating a heading for the field 

0.32   Fri 22 July 2005, 23:00
        - added a field_callback argument to tabulate() - see an example in the 
            Maypole edit template

0.31   Fri  22 July 2005, 00:50
        - tabulate() now defaults to showing columns for display_columns + related. 
        - tabulate now accepts objects as an optional *named* argument, and not as a required 
            positional argument. If not supplied, defaults to $request->objects
        - renamed _tabulate to _tabulate_object
        - fixed excessive warnings from _tabulate_object if no stringify_column (still issues 
            some warnings in debug mode)

0.303  Thur 21 July 2005, 11:40
        - um, now it stringifies *and returns* them

0.302  Thur 21 July 2005, 10:00
        - maybe_link_view was not handling non-Maypole objects properly - now 
            it stringifies them

0.301  Thur 21 July 2005, 09:45
        - test if a Maypole::Model thing is an object or a class in maybe_link_view
        - test definedness of $order_by before doing string comparison in tabulate

0.3    Wed  20 July 2005, 12:00
        - added code from Ron McClain to support clickable search-by column headers 
        - empty has_many columns were not being rendered in listview (now they are 
            rendered as an empty table cell, so keeping in sync with column headers)
            because maybe_many_link_views() was returning an empty list when supplied 
            with an empty list of values. Now it returns ''

0.2    Wed  20 July 2005, 01:00
        - added 'fields' argument to tabulate() - it was hard-wired to 
            use display_columns
            - fields defaults to display_columns + related (i.e. db columns plus has_many accessors)
        - added maybe_many_link_views() method

0.11   Fri  10 Jun 2005, 12:40
        - POD fixes
        - changed the location of quicktable_defaults. Now it's 
            simply a Class::Data::Inheritable method on the model

0.1    Thur  9 Jun 2005, 23:00
        First version, released on an unsuspecting world.
