</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">     &#9;3.1. &#9;Application of License.  </B>The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation Section 2.2.  The Source Code version of Governed Code may be distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You distribute.  You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder.  However, You may include an additional document offering the additional rights described in Section 3.5. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">     &#9;3.2. &#9;Availability of Source Code.  </B>Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License either on the same media as an Executable Code version or via an Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable Code version available; and if made available via an Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">     &#9;3.3. Description of Modifications.  </B>You must cause all Governed Code to which you contribute to contain a file documenting the changes You made to create that Governed Code and the date of any change.  You must include a prominent statement that the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code provided by AnIdea and including the name of AnIdea in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable Code version or related documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership of the Governed Code. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">     &#9;3.4. Intellectual Property Matters. </P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">          &#9;&#9;<B>3.4.1.&#9;Third Party Claims.</B>  If You have knowledge that a party claims an intellectual property right in particular functionality or code (or its utilization under this License), you must include a text file with the source code distribution titled &quot;LEGAL&quot; which describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact.  If you obtain such knowledge after You make Your Modification available as described in Section 3.2, You shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies You make available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying AnIdea and appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Governed Code that new knowledge has been obtained.  In the event that You are a Contributor, You represent that, except as disclosed in the LEGAL file, your Modifications are your original creations and, to the best of your knowledge, no third party has any claim (including but not limited to intellectual property claims) relating to your Modifications.  You represent that the LEGAL file includes complete details of any license or other restriction associated with any part of your Modifications.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">          &#9;&#9;<B>3.4.2. &#9;Contributor APIs.</B>  If Your Modification is an application programming interface and You own or control patents which are reasonably necessary to implement that API, you must also include this information in the LEGAL file. </P>

<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">     &#9;3.5. &#9;Required Notices.  </B>You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code, and this License in any documentation for the Source Code, where You describe recipients' rights relating to Governed Code.  If You created one or more Modification(s), You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then you must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory file) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice.  You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Governed Code.  However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of AnIdea or any Contributor.  You must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify AnIdea and every Contributor for any liability incurred by AnIdea or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.  </P>

<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">     &#9;3.6. &#9;Distribution of Executable Code Versions.  </B>You may distribute Governed Code in Executable Code form only if the requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Governed Code, and if You include a prominent notice stating that the Source Code version of the Governed Code is available under the terms of this License, including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2.  The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable Code version, related documentation or collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the Governed Code.  You may distribute the Executable Code version of Governed Code under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable Code version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this License.  If You distribute the Executable Code version under a different license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by AnIdea or any Contributor.  You hereby agree to indemnify AnIdea and every Contributor for any liability incurred by AnIdea or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">     &#9;3.7. &#9;Larger Works.  </B>You may create a Larger Work by combining Governed Code with other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Governed Code due to statute or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect.  Such description must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code.
