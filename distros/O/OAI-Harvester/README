Net::OAI::Harvester
-------------------

Net::OAI::Harvester is a Perl library for interacting with OAI-PMH repositories.
OAI-PMH stands for Open Archives Intitiatve Protocol for Metadata Harvesting.
More about OAI-PMH can be found at http://www.openarchives.org.

INSTALLATION

You *must* be connected to the Internet to run the test suite.

Either:

perl Build.PL
Build
Build test
Build install

Or:

perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install


DEPENDENCIES

OAI-PMH is essentially XML over HTTP so rather than reinvent the wheel there
are a few dependencies.

LWP::UserAgent - for HTTP 
XML::SAX - for XML parsing
URI - for url representation
Storable - for object serialization

You also probably should be using Perl 5.8.0 at least since many repositories 
contain UTF8 data.


TROUBLESHOOTING

See the Changes document for a description of a potentially breaking
change in custom handler operation introduced in version 1.20.

The test suite recognizes the environment variable NOH_ParserPackage to
force usage of an specific parser:

NOH_ParserPackage=XML::SAX::PurePerl ./Build test

This is to work around cases where the file ParserDetails.ini of
XML::SAX::ParserFactory is not (yet) set up properly and the
expected automatic fallback to XML::SAX::PurePerl somehow fails.

--

It is crucial to have version 1.04 of XML::SAX::Base. This version
is installed along with the XML-SAX package which is contained in
the "vendor" tree of the perl libraries on many systems. On CPAN
there also exists a separate module XML::SAX::Base with version 1.02
only which is not sufficient and - if installed - typically resides
in the "site_perl" branch of the libraries, thus taking precedence
over the newer version. Please make sure to uninstall/remove version 
1.02 of XML::SAX::Base when you encounter it in your installation.
