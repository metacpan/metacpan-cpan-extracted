Revision history for Perl extension Apache2::ASP.

2.46    2011-03-25
  - !!DEPRECATED!! in favor of ASP4.
  - Please don't use Apache2::ASP for any new development.
  - Use ASP4 instead; it is much better, faster and maintained.
  - Upgrading from Apache2::ASP to ASP4 is quite easy - just convert your
    apache2-asp-config.xml to asp4-config.json, update/remove your GlobalASA.pm
    and update your httpd.conf.

2.45    2009-11-20
  - Fixed* a bug that caused deeeeeeeeply nested Master/Child page scenarios to cause
    the MasterPage's ASP objects ($Response, $Request, etc) to not get initialized.
    This fixes the dreaded "Cannot call 'Write' on an undefined value - line 1" error.
    * Involves deleting your page cache before the udpate will take full effect!

2.44    2009-11-17
  - Got rid of annoying "Software caused connection abort" errors.

2.43    2009-11-16
  - Requests to handlers that don't exist will now result in a 404 error, not a 500 error.

2.42    2009-11-11
  - You can now test multiple websites at the same time (eg: Public and Admin websites)
    from within the same test script.  Example given in POD for Apache2::ASP::API

2.41    2009-10-14
  - Bugfix: Errors will now appear on-screen, rather than the default Apache error.

2.40    2009-10-14
  - Enhancement: multipart/form-data posts to MediaManagers no longer require
    actual files to be uploaded.  Useful for forms that have an optional file upload field.

2.39    2009-08-23
  - Bugfix:  Deeply-nexted MasterPage setups sometimes did not initialize the
    intrinsic ASP objects in the root-most MasterPage ($Response, $Session, etc).

2.38    2009-08-09
  - Bugfix: $Response->Redirect in a handler after $Response->TrapInclude gave
    errors "Response.Status cannot be changed after headers have been sent" (this
    is now fixed).

2.37    2009-06-10
  - API change: Upload hooks are deprecated and all but disabled.
  - Bugfix: The upload_start event was not getting called for UploadHandler or its subclasses.

2.37_03 2009-05-19
  - Bugfix: On Apache2 under Gentoo (perhaps others as well) HTTPContext->send_headers
    was not always called before content was written to the client.  This caused
    cookies and other headers to not get written to the client.

2.37_02 2009-05-14
  - Uploads' filehandle was not closed, causing problems where the last few bytes
    were not flushed to disk.

2.37_01 2009-05-13
  - Working on removing the dependency on libapreq2.  It is just too much pain.
  - Several minor fixes and performance tweaks.

2.36  2009-03-21
  - MediaManager updates.  pnotes has proven unstable.
  - Upgraded to Module::Install.
  - Restructured tests into numerically sequential folders.
  - Added several tests to improve code-coverage.
  - Removed some unused code from Response.
  - Server.URLDecode now does the Right Thing for utf-8 characters.
  - Added 'encoding' from 'Encode' as a prerequisite.

2.35  2009-03-11
  - Minor updates here and there.

2.34  2009-03-03
  - Was setting content-length header twice in MediaManager.

2.33  2009-03-03
  - HTTP headers out were having issues.

2.32  2009-03-01
  - Added Apache2::ASP::HTTPContext::SubContext
  - Added t/htdocs/subcontext/*.asp
  - Added t/handlers/simple.pm
  - Re-worked the way Response.Include and Response.TrapInclude work on the inside.
  - No external changes were made.

2.31  2009-02-19
  - Apache2::ASP::HTTPContext order of operations during setup_request was updated.
  - Apache2::ASP::ModPerl returns proper error HTTP codes when errors occur.
  - Requests for non-existent *.asp scripts returns a proper 404.
  - Apache2::ASP::HTTPContext copes better with syntax errors in handlers.
  - Missing handlers are coped with better now.

2.30  2009-02-19
  - Apache2::ASP::ASPPage was misreporting line numbers.

2.29  2009-02-15
  - Added Apache2::ASP::SessionStateManager::Memcached
  - Added Apache2::ASP::ApplicationStateManager::Memcached
  - Both Memcached state managers require Cache::Memcached.
  - Fixed a few outgoing HTTP header bugs which prevented Safari from handling
    $Response->Redirect behaviors properly, and caused LWP::UserAgent to give
    warnings about 'got EOF when chunk expected' and "x-client: died" errors.
  - Added Apache2::ASP::HTTPContext::FilterResolver
  - Added Apache2::ASP::HTTPContext::HandlerResolver
  - Added Apache2::ASP::HTTPContext::HandlerRunner
  - Major refactoring of Apache2::ASP::HTTPContext

2.28  2009-02-12
  - Refactored a few things causing big slowdowns.  Devel::NYTProf++!

2.27  2009-02-09
  - Typo in ConfigParser.pm

2.26  2009-02-09
  - Forgot the *::NonPersisted state managers in the MANIFEST

2.25  2009-02-09
  - Added <disable_persistence> element to the XML config. Disabling persistence
    for high-traffic pages is sometimes necessary and/or desirable.

2.24  2009-02-03
  - Narrowed the search for leaked open filehandles to Apache2::ASP::SimpleCGI
    when handling a file upload in test/API mode.  Added DESTROY handler to close
    any remaining filehandles when the object goes out of scope.

2.23  2009-02-01
  - "Too many open filehandles" error was popping up.  Attempting to use IO::File
    to solve this problem.
  - Added IO::File as a prerequisite file.

2.22  2009-01-31
  - Apache2::ASP::MediaManager was misbehaving when attempting to delete a file
    no longer on disk.

2.21  2009-01-31
  - Apache2::ASP::MediaManager was incorrectly printing the content-disposition
    header, causing some browsers to append an extra "," to the end of filesnames
    when they were downloaded.

2.20  2009-01-30
  - Fixed documentation for Apache2::ASP::Mock::Connection

2.19  2009-01-30
  - Fixed documentation for Apache2::ASP::Test::Base.

2.18  2009-01-29
  - Added a lot more documentation.
  - Under Apache2::ASP::Test::Base and Apache2::ASP::API, $Server->RegisterCleanup now
    gets called at the end of each request - not when the pool object goes out
    of scope (which caused some unwanted behavior).

2.17  2009-01-28
  - More tweaking.  Please upgrade to this version.

2.16  2009-01-28
  - Apache2::ASP::Mock::RequestRec sometimes confess()ed if Response->Include was called.

2.15  2009-01-28
  - Made some minor tweaks to the way uploads are handled internally.  No public changes.

2.14  2009-01-25
  - <asp:Content/> tags inside of pages that use MasterPages were not being passed 
    TrapInclude or Include arguments (i.e. $Response->Include("/page.asp", { arg1 => "foo" }) ).

2.13  2009-01-25
  - Apache2::ASP::MediaManager did not provide any content-type header for
    file types not listed in MIME::Types (eg: *.ogv).  Now "application/octet-stream"
    is returned when MIME::Types does not return anything.

2.12  2009-01-20
  - The "Cookies" HTTP header was not properly handled in the Test UserAgent.
  - Incoming HTTP headers were comingled with outgoing HTTP headers in HTTPContext.

2.11  2009-01-10
  - Several fixes to cookie behavior problems.
  - Removed <module>Class::DBI::Lite</module> from apache2-asp-config.xml.

2.10  2009-01-05
  - The Set-Cookie header for session state no longer includes the domain parameter.

2.09  2008-12-12
  - Apache2::ASP::API->get("/") or get("/folder-name/") works as expected (without
    forcing you to include "/index.asp" at the end.
  - Added 05.00-folder-uri.t to make sure that "/folder-name/" URI's are supported
    via the programmatic API.
  - After testing, we remove /tmp/asp_*

2.08  2008-12-10
  - Updated the POD for Apache2::ASP::API.

2.07  2008-12-10
  - $ENV{DOCUMENT_ROOT} is persisted between requests when using Apache2::ASP::Test::UserAgent.
  - Added Apache2::ASP::API

2.06  2008-12-03
  - Removed a failing test.

2.05  2008-12-03
  - asphelper adds /etc/properties.yaml and /etc/test_fixtures.yaml, as well as
    an example "contact form" page, handler and unit test.

2.04  2008-12-02
  - Updated asphelper script.  It was writing a GlobalASA.pm with a syntax error.
  - Added more tests.

2.03  2008-12-01
  - Updated ASPPage to handle parsing MasterPages that include code similar to the following:
  <asp:ContentPlaceHolder id="meta_description"><meta name="description" content="" /></asp:ContentPlaceHolder>
  <asp:ContentPlaceHolder id="meta_keywords"><meta name="keywords" content="" /></asp:ContentPlaceHolder>

2.02  2008-12-01
  - Sometimes @INC would not contain all of the directories specified under <libs>
    in the config.  This bug should now be fixed.

2.01  2008-11-30
  - The codebase is solid and has been running several relatively high-traffic
    websites for several months.  Time for a production release of the 2.x code.

2.00_26   2008-11-20
  - Fixed a bug that caused problems when a page inheriting from a sub-masterpage
    overrode a placeholder from a super-masterpage.

2.00_25   2008-11-20
  - Fixed a bug with nested MasterPages which caused some fatal errors.
  - Fixed another issue with nested MasterPages which caused the parser to
    not interpret all <asp:ConentPlaceHolder /> tags (when there were more than one)
    inside of an <asp:Content /> in a nested MasterPage.  I suppose you really
    had to be there.
  - Added tests to check for these problems with nested MasterPages.

2.00_24   2008-11-19
  - Added Apache2::ASP::Manual::BestPractices.

2.00_23   2008-11-19
  - Added asphelper.
  - Moved asphelper and runasp into the sbin/* directory in the distribution.
  - Added Test::Memory::Cycle to the PREREQ_RPM list in Makefile.PL
  - Fixed a (hopefully) rare corner-case in which thaw($Application) would return
    undef - the solution was to default to an empty hashref { }.
  - Fixed a but in ASPPage in which empty asp:ContentPlaceHolder tags in MasterPages
    caused the "%s does not define an asp:ContentPlaceHolder with an id of %s" error
    even for legitimate child pages.
  - Added Apache2::ASP::ConfigNode::System::Settings.
  - $Config->system->settings->someSettingName works as expected.
  - foreach $hashref ( $Config->system->settings ) { } now works as expected.
  - Added more tests to t/01.03-configloader.t for config testing (by no means complete).

2.00_22   2008-10-10
  - Fixed a bug which caused GlobalASA to not initialize properly.

2.00_21   2008-11-10
  - Minor adjustments.
  - Added some documentation.

2.00_20   2008-11-07
  - Added missing file t/lib/My/ErrorHandler.pm to MANIFEST.

2.00_19   2008-11-07
  - Added some /Manual/* documentation.
  - HTTPContext now correctly traps "unhandled tag" errors.

2.00_18   2008-11-05
  - New *.pm files in the PAGE_CACHE are chmod 0666.
  - Added ErrorHandler.  By default, it prints a stacktrace to the browser and
    sends a copy to the email address specified in the <errors> config.
  - Added <errors> section to config.
  - Updated configuration DTD for <errors> section.
  - Apache2::ASP::ModPerl now correctly returns a 0 value and sets $r->status.
  - $Server->RegisterCleanup references the correct Apache2::RequestRec object.
  - Added "runasp," the command-line interface to run ASP scripts.

2.00_17   2008-11-04
  - Fixed a bug which caused Apache2::ASP::Test::UserAgent to not get the
    output buffer content from the correct Mock request object (meaning that
    $s->ua->get('/url.asp')->content was always empty.
  - Added test to make sure that the above fix stays in place.
  - Internal changes within HTTPContext WRT self-hash-notation upgraded to get_prop().

2.00_16   2008-11-03
  - ASPPage mkdir's each missing part of the page cache.
  - ConfigParser correctly handles configs that don't specify any request filters.
  - Re-included Apache2::ASP::TransHandler, albeit with different semantics.

2.00_15   2008-11-01
  - XML Config file schema updated - (settings, env_vars) to support DTD validation.
  - DTD for XML Config is now included.

2.00_14   2008-10-31
  - If querystring or form data contains multiple values for the same parameter,
    that parameter will become an arrayref of values.
  - Multiple config post-processors can be defined in the config XML file.  They
    will be executed in the order they are listed in the config XML file.
  - Nested master pages are now supported.

2.00_13   2008-10-30
  - Each upload form submission should now include a unique "uploadID=xxx" value.
  - Multiple concurrent uploads from the same user under the same session are
    now supported because of the uploadID=xxx logic.

2.00_12   2008-10-29
  - (handler)->init_asp_objects( $context ) was not getting called correctly.

2.00_11   2008-10-29
  - ASPPage updated so that pages containing "~" in their text will not cause
    syntax errors after being parsed.
  - File uploads are handled correctly by ModPerl, UploadHandler and MediaManager.

2.00_10   2008-10-26
  - Server.RegisterCleanup(\&subref, \@argref) now fires both from the command-line
    and within an actual mod_perl environment.

2.00_09   2008-10-24
  - Pages that use MasterPages are now executed with the correct @_.
  - Added Apache2::ASP::FormHandler again.

2.00_08   2008-10-23
  - Apache2::ASP::Apache creates a new HTTPContext from the correct class/subclass now.
  - Source code is filtered with: s/(\$Response\->End)/return $1/sg;

2.00_07   2008-10-22
  - Adjustments to HTTPContext to better support massive stack-depths of "inner" HTTPContexts.

2.00_06   2008-10-22
  - Tweaks in ApplicationStateManager and SessionStateManager to avoid a transaction
    race condition.
  - Config initializes itself (rather than the HTTPContext doing it).
  - Config is now cached in memory on a per-process, per-disk-path basis.

2.00_05   2008-10-20
  - Apache2::ASP::HTTPContext now handles final config initialization including
    setting %ENV vars, @INC modifications and loading modules as specified
    in the config xml file.
  - Code Coverage: 70.50% (average:stmt+bran+cond+sub)
  - Bugfix: Application->save was getting called at the beginning and end of 
    *every* request.  This behavior has been fixed.
  - Various minor tweaks, removing "vestigial" code chunks.
  - Subclassing Apache2::ASP::HTTPContext is now possible.
  - Syntax errors inside of includes are handled better.

2.00_04   2008-10-16

2.00_02   2008-10-15
  - Partial page caching has been realized.

2.00_01   2008-10-15
  - Complete rewrite.
  !!!! BREAKING CHANGES !!!!
    - XML Config file format is different!  See docs for details!
    - Apache Config file is different!  See docs for details!
  - Now "master pages" are supported a la ASP.Net (i.e. named placeholders).
  - Session and Application are only saved to database if they have been changed
    during the course of the request:
  - Major performance increase.  Using master pages instead of includes can
    further increase performance.
  - Basic tags support has been suspended for now.
  - Removed dependency Datetime::Duration.
  - Removed dependency Sys::Hostname.
  

1.59 2008-08-16
  - Added missing file t/htdocs/virtualinclude.asp to the MANIFEST
    so all tests should pass now.

1.58 2008-08-06
  - Now <!-- #include virtual="/file.asp" --> and 
    <!-- #include file="/abs/path/to/file.asp" --> work as you might expect.
    This means that Apache2::ASP will work nicely with DreamWeaver and other
    popular WYSIWYG's that can parse that sort of include directive.

1.57 2008-08-06
  - Removed POD for Request->Document.  Server-side DOM will have to wait.
  - New in this release is basic "Tags" support.  See Apache2::ASP::Tag for details.

1.56_02 2008-08-02
  - Added documentation for all Apache2::ASP::DOM::* classes.

1.56_1  2008-08-01
  - Added preliminary support for "XMLSubs"-esque tags.
  - Added preliminary (experimental) support for (!simple!) server-side DOM.
    (**Does not merge $Response->Include()'ed DOM with parent DOM).

1.55 2008-07-13
  - Apache2::ASP::SessionStateManager now uses the correct database connection.
    This problem would only come up when multiple Apache2::ASP web applications
    using different session data sources were running under the same Apache
    instance.
  - Ditto for Apache2::ASP::ApplicationStateManager.

1.54 2008-07-05
  - Adjusted Apache2::ASP::MediaManager so that it will not unlink the /MEDIA
    directory if someone attempts to delete a file and neglects to specify
    which file should be deleted.
  - Also updated Apache2::ASP::MediaManager to more gracefully handle missing
    uploaded files.

1.53 2008-07-05
  - Fixed a bug that caused Apache2::ASP::Config to die if no request filters
    were specified within the <request_filters> element in the config file.

1.52 2008-06-18
  - While using Apache2::ASP::Test::Base, $ENV{APACHE2_ASP_APPLICATION_ROOT} 
    is now persisted between requests.  This means that if (somewhere else)
    you set $ENV{APACHE2_ASP_APPLICATION_ROOT} in your code, it will persist
    between requests.

1.51 2008-06-12
  - Speed improvements, up to 100% faster now due to the following:
  - Added XML::Parser as a requirement.
  - Caching (in memory) Configuration data on a per-domain basis.

1.49 2008-05-29
  - Memory leaks are now completely gone.
  - Speed improvements (20% faster than v1.47).

1.48 2008-05-27
  - $Request->Form returns a singleton hash for the duration of
    a request.  This means that modifications to the global $Form
    object are available to other "areas" of your web application
    for the rest of the same request.

1.47 2008-05-26
  - $Request->QueryString('field') returns the querystring value for 'field'.
  - $Request->QueryString returns $ENV{HTTP_QUERYSTRING}.

1.46 2008-05-21
  - Apache2::ASP::MediaManager::before_download() must return true
    before the filehandle is opened (for the file about to be downloaded).
  - Apache2::ASP::MediaManager's before_delete() and after_delete() methods
    are now also passed the full path to the file that is to be deleted.

1.45 2008-05-15
  - Minor adjustments.

1.44 2008-05-14
  - Minor speed improvements (20% faster).
  - Miscellaneous fixes here and there.

1.43 2008-05-13
  - Fixed some damaged documentation.

1.42 2008-05-13
  - New media manager tests didn't make it in to the last release.

1.41 2008-05-13
  - Apache2::ASP::GlobalConfig will now also look 1 level "up" from
    the current working directory (retrieved from Cwd) for the 
    apache2-asp-config.xml file.  This is important for when you have
    (for example) an /sbin/ folder with asp-related scripts.
  - Added method $Server->URLDecode( $str ).
  - Minor tweaks to Apache2::ASP::MediaManager and Apache2::ASP::Test::UserAgent
    to allow testing of MediaManager classes/handlers from the command-line.
  - Added some missing POD for Apache2::ASP::Config and Apache2::ASP::Config::Node.
  - Added tests for Apache2::ASP::MediaManager.
  - Added tests for "wizard" functionality (multiple-step forms, anyways).
  - Skipped v1.40 because of the way CPAN handles version numbers.

1.39 2008-05-03
  - Apache2::ASP::Response stores the buffer as an array instead of
    as a string.
  - Performance enhancements.
  - Better test coverage for several modules.
  - More tests.

1.38 2008-03-20
  - Intrinsic ASP objects (Request, Response, etc) are now
    initialized for a handler and all of its super-classes.
    This fixes a bug in which handlers that subclass another
    handler (that subclasses yet another handler) will no longer
    receive errors when the parent class does a $Response->Redirect
    for example.
  - Apache2::ASP::MediaManager checks the 'mode' parameter and behaves
    differently based on its value.

1.37 2008-03-16
  - Updated MANIFEST to include missing file t/lib/MyDBI.pm

1.36 2008-03-04
  - Rewrote Apache2::ASP::Config and Apache2::ASP::GlobalConfig.
  - Removed Apache2::ASP::PostConfigHandler.
  - You no longer need to include the following in your httpd.conf:
      PerlModule Apache2::ASP::PostConfigHandler
      PerlPostConfigHandler Apache2::ASP::PostConfigHandler
  - Minor speed improvements as a result of cleaner config logic.

1.35 2008-02-27
  - Removed all references to "use CGI" to reduce memory footprint
    and improve performance.
  - Added Apache2::ASP::SimpleCGI for use by Apache2::ASP::Test::UserAgent.
  - Added dependency HTTP::Body for Apache2::ASP::SimpleCGI to function.

1.34 2008-02-26
  - Minor updates to Apache2::ASP::MediaManager.
  - Added a workaround to Apache2::ASP::GlobalConfig for the
    "internal dummy connection" issue.
    More details at http://wiki.apache.org/httpd/InternalDummyConnection

1.33 2008-02-25
  - Fixed a bug that caused the intrinsic ASP objects (Request, Response, etc)
    to not be available at the right point in time for UploadHook subclasses
    (including subclasses of MediaManager).
    So now, calling $Response->Redirect(...) from sub after_create() will work.

1.32 2008-02-24
  - Removed Application_OnStart and added Server_OnStart event to
    GlobalASA.
  - Added documentation to Apache2::ASP::Test::Base.
  - Added documentation to Apache2::ASP::Test::Fixtures.

1.31 2008-02-20
  - Added $Session->reset() method.
  - Added Apache2::ASP::Test::Base.
  - Added dependancy Data::Properties::YAML
  - Added /etc/properties.yaml
  - Added Apache2::ASP::Test::Fixtures.
  - Added /etc/test_fixtures.yaml
  - Fixed a bug in Apache2::ASP::Request that caused forms with multiple
    values for the same parameter (i.e. 3 checkboxes named the same, but 
    with different values) to only return 1 value.
  - Completely overhauled the test suite.  No longer requires Apache::Test
    and should run find as root.  More tests are needed, but at least
    what's there should run correctly.
  - Fixed a bug in Apache2::ASP::Config that caused errors when a 
    Session or Application State Manager was not in @INC until
    after the <settings> section had been initialized.

1.29 2008-02-06
  - Fixed a bug that caused Response->Include to misbehave when used in
    conjunction with RequestFilters.

1.28 2008-02-06
  - Added $Response->Decline and changed the return value of $Response->End
    and $Response->Redirect to 0 and 302 respectively.
  - Now inside RequestFilters you can simply say 'return $Response->Declined'
    or 'return $Response->Redirect("/mypage.asp")' to exit the RequestFilter.
  - Documentation for RequestFilters and Response needs to be updated to
    reflect this change.

1.27 2008-02-06
  - Moved the <request_filters> config section under config/web_application 
    instead of config/web_application/settings.

1.26 2008-02-05
  - Hotfix for config.  Was crashing unless settings.request_filters was defined.

1.25 2008-02-05
  - Added the concept of "Request Filters" as Apache2::ASP::RequestFilter.  These
    are useful for centralizing authorization code.  Request Filters are stackable.
  - Added config.web_application.settings.request_filters.filter and documented it in
    the documentation for Apache2::ASP::RequestFilter.
  - Request Filters will be considered experimental until v1.26 is released.

1.24 2008-01-17
  - Fixes a problem with $Request->Cookies( $name ) that caused it to return undef
    instead of the cookie's value.
  - When Response->Include( $nonexistent_file ) is called, a simple diagnostic is
    printed to the buffer ("Cannot Response.Include '$file' - the file does not exist")
    and Carp::cluck dumps a stacktrace to STDERR.
  - If $Response->End or $Response->Redirect is called in Script_OnStart then the script
    is no longer processed.

1.23 2007-12-27
  - Apache2::ASP::Config now only adds PAGE_CACHE and $Config->handler_root to @INC
    if they have not already been added before.
  - Apache2::ASP::Response no longer flushes headers after Response.Include().

1.22 2007-12-18
  - Fixed a bug that caused changes in the $Session object made
    from within $Response->Include() and $Response->TrapInclude() to not persist.
  - Removed warnings like this:
    Use of uninitialized value in substitution (s///) at /usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.8.5/Apache2/ASP/Server.pm line 40.
  - $Session->save() does not (wastefully) persist $s->{asp} any longer.
  - Apache2::ASP::Request was handling cookies wrong.  This behavior has been improved.
    Still does not handle expiration yet (this can be done with $Response->AddHeader(...) ).
  - Improved (fixed) problems associated with running multiple Apache2::ASP-powered websites
    under the same Apache server under different VirtualHosts.  Now expects PerlOptions +Parent 
    and PerlSetEnv APACHE2_ASP_APPLICATION_ROOT /path/to/your/root inside of <VirtualHost> directives.

1.21 2007-12-04
  - Bugfixes to Apache2::ASP::Request and Apache2::ASP::Response.
  - *Recommended* upgrade to this version if you are running any previous version.

1.20 2007-10-22

    after the "run()" method is called.

1.17 2007-10-20
  - Updates for Apache2::ASP::Test::UserAgent.
  - Updates for Apache2::ASP::Test::MockRequest.

1.16 2007-10-20
  - Adjusted Apache2::ASP::Config and Apache2::ASP::GlobalConfig to properly support
    support running multiple websites under one Apache instance.
  - Removed "sticky forms" support.

1.15 2007-07-03
  - Added several new pages to the Manual.
  - /handlers/My_Handler and /handlers/My/Handler both map to My::Handler
    for the package and /handlers/My/Handler.pm for the filename.
  - Updated documentation in several places.
  - Local GlobalASA.pm class is now required to use web_application.application_name + '::GlobalASA'
    as its package name.  So if web_application.application_name = "DefaultApp" then
    it would say:
    package DefaultApp::GlobalASA;
    use base 'Apache2::ASP::GlobalASA';
    ...
  - Multiple Apache2::ASP web applications can now be run on the same machine.
  - Successfully installed on Windows, but it requires some work.  And performance is bad.

1.14 2007-06-30
  - $Form data is only forwarded if a page is posting back to itself 
    (i.e. - paging through a recordset) or if the form was posted to
    a FormHandler class.

1.07 2007-06-23
  - Fixed a bug that caused 404 errors to return a blank page instead of the standard
    '404 Not Found' message.
  - Adjusted POD so that Apache2::ASP::Manual::Intro shows up correctly.

1.06 2007-06-23
  - Fixed a bug in Apache2::ASP::PageHandler that caused a bug in which changed ASP
    scripts would not be reloaded by other Apache processes after the first Apache
    process had recompiled the *.pm file as a result of the ASP script being changed.

1.05 2007-06-23
  - $Application->save() is now called at the end of each (non-error) request.

1.04 2007-06-23
  - GlobalASA::Script_OnFlush is only called when the current handler
    isa Apache2::ASP::PageHandler.

1.03 2007-06-23
  - Updated Apache2::ASP::PageHandler to correctly decide whether an ASP
    script should be recompiled or not.

1.02 2007-06-23
  - Apache2::ASP::Manual::Intro was changed from *.pod to *.pm so that CPAN
    would index it properly.
