0.46  2010-06-27
    - s/_03/ on the version

0.46_03  2010-06-27
    - Internals change cleanups regarding weakening $entry->{data} with
      passthrough objects
    - fiddle leak tracking code around to avoid keeping temporary refs around,
      which makes Devel::FindRef more useful in the user's leak tracker

    - Support for caching of live objects (i.e. immutable ones)
    - Fix the =head1 NAME of Tutorial::JA
    - Move t/set.t into a standalone test fixture

0.46_01  2010-06-20
    - Lots of refactoring to LiveObjects
        - metadata is keyed by ID, not object
        - keep_entries attribute allows entries to be discarded once used
          (defaults to true for compatibility, may change in the future)
        - clear_leaks/leak_tracker attributes
    - remove txn_{begin,commit,rollback} methods, as they require maintaining a
      stack to be properly used (#58166)
    - KiokuDB::Cmd no longer tries to rerun itself after autoinstall, this is
      very flakey when the installation is the result of an upgrade instead of
      a fresh install

0.45  2010-06-05
    - Introduce KiokuDB::Backend::Role::GC which allows backends to construct
      their own garbage collector for the GC command.
    - name mangle inline classes in tests to avoid false failure reports (e.g.
      when a Foo.pm is in @INC)
    - add scoped_txn, txn_begin, txn_commit, txn_rollback

0.44  2010-06-02
    - Remove accidental use of namespace::autoclean instead of namespace::clean
      (doy)
    - Proper fix for class_version this time =(

0.43  2010-05-26
    - Now throws proper error objects instead of unintelligiable hash refs
    - Fix JSON serialization (omitted keys necessary for version tracking and
      GIN indexing)
    - Add a 'clone' method to KiokuDB::Set
    - Suppress additional recursion and repeated weaken() warnings
    - Try harder to skip DateTime formatter serialization roundtripping on JSON based backends

0.42  2010-04-16
    - Update translation of tutorial (ktat)
    - use RegexpRef type constraint instead of Regexp (Regexp look blessed but
      not in C land) (doy)
    - Force stringification of version objects before serialization
    - 'mongodb' DSN moniker (omega)
    - Typemap support for the REF reftype (just an alias for SCALAR)

    - Allow using a JSON string as a DSN, e.g.
      '{"dsn":"dbi:SQLite:foo","schema":"MyApp::DB"}'
    - Added DateTime::Duration to the default typemap

0.39  2010-03-17
    - Allow a backend to provide a default typemap in addition to the serializer one
    - call 'register_handle' on duck-typing backends in KiokuDB::BUILD
    - plug a leak where the live object set kept an indirect reference to
      passthrough entries

0.38  2010-03-06
    - Fix a bug where object streams would end prematurely (Graham Barr)

0.37  2010-03-03
    - Resolve long standing issues with TXN::Memory
        - TXN::Memory::Scan role now implements proper enumeration
        - Fixture::TXN::Scan verifies transactional semantics of enumeration
          for all transactional backends
    - Re-enable $linker->queue (fixed coderef failure case)
    - Various doc fixes
    - Class versioning (disabled by default)

0.36  2010-02-20
    - Resolve a bug when deleting objects that are still live,
      lookup($dead_object_id) would still return the object even though it's
      not actually in storage.
    - Don't call $backend->exists with no arguments in FSCK
    - various API methods now just return; when invoked with no arguments,
      instead of potentially erroring at the backend level

0.35  2010-02-05
    - bump dependency version for MooseX::YAML to prevent bad interaction with
      MooseX::Blessed::Reconstruct

    - Added Japanese tutorial KiokuDB::Tutorial::JA (ktat)
    - Correct indexing tutorial example (ask)
    - Use done_testing() instead of no_plan (dandv)
    - Fix behavior of KiokuDB::Lazy attributes with a trigger (a Moose change
      caused infinite recursion)
    - add a refresh method (no deep_refresh yet)

0.32  2009-07-30
    - Don't assume all metaclasses have the does_role method
    - Various documentation fixes
    - Add no warnings 'recursion' to KiokuDB::Linker

0.31  2009-07-06
    - Remove MooseX::Getopt usage from verbosity role
    - Don't depend on KiokuDB::Cmd in makefile, just warn (avoids recursive
      dependency)

0.30  2009-07-05
    - Split KiokuDB::Cmd into a separate distribution

0.29  2009-06-27
    - work around Test::Exception leak relating to closures in 5.8

      5.8) (Thanks to Otto Hirr)
    - KiokuDB::Lazy did not have any effect unless the value was a first class
      objects. Now it works for all refs (e.g. arrays of objects)
    - TODO list updated
    - correct dry_run option in WithDSN when transactions are unsupported

0.26  2009-04-08
    - avoid using deprecated Moose/Class::MOP features
    - bump deps on Moose and Class::MOP

0.25  2009-03-27
    - attempt to reduce memory usage by using a custom destruction guard
    - only run concurrency stress test if env var is set
    - various doc fixes

0.24  2009-02-28
    - various doc fixes (Dan Dascalescu)
    - fix semantics when a Set::Deferred outlives the scope in which it was
      created and then gets vivified

    - Add KiokuDB::DoNotSerialize trait (MooseX::Storage trait is still respected)
    - add Collapser::Buffer, which replaces the various temp attrs. Changes
      from the buffer are only written to live objects after a successful write
      to the backend. This also fixes duplicate ID::Content objects being
      inserted when one is already live.
    - Various doc improvements

0.20  2009-01-13
    - Refactored KiokuDB::TypeMap::Composite out of KiokuDB::TypeMap::Default
    - Added KiokuDB::TypeMap::Entry::StorableHook, which allows reusing of
      existing STORABLE_freeze hooks
    - Fixed handling of 'root' flag (was not being properly preserved)
    - Added 'is_root', 'set_root', 'unset_root'
    - Added a 'deep_update' method
    - Now depends on YAML::XS and JSON::XS (not optional deps anymore)
    - Various improvements to command line roles
    - Added a new GC command and a naive mark & sweep collector
    - Added a new Edit command using Proc::InvokeEditor to do a dump and a load
      in a single transaction
    - Added KiokuDB::Role::Intrinsic for objects which want to be collapsed
      intrinsically
    - Added KiokuDB::Role::Immutable for objects which never change after being inserted
    - Added KiokUDB::Role::ID::Content for content addressible objects
    - Test suite cleanups
    - Added ID enumeration to Scan role
    - Added 'allow_classes', 'allow_bases' and 'allow_class_builders' options
      to KiokuDB allowing for easy typemap creation.

0.19  2009-01-05
    - Introduce KiokuDB::Stream::Objects, a Data::Stream::Bulk for objects that
      automatically creates a new scope for each block. This makes it much
      harder to leak when iterating through C<all_objects>.

0.18  2009-01-04
    - Fix KiokUDB->connect("foo", @args) when the dsn string has no parameters
      (@args were being ignored)
    - Add a fixture to test that overwriting an entry is not allowed.

0.17  2008-12-30
    - More docs
    - remove KiokuDB::Backend::Null which was historically used for testing but
      is long since useless.
    - remove deprecated command line tools
    - provide a 'txn_do' method in Role::TXN for backends which only implement
      txn_begin, txn_rollback and txn_commit
    - correct plan for t/uuid.t when a module is missing

0.16  2008-12-28
    - Lots of docs
    - Fix KiokuDB::Reference's Storable hook limitation using a simple
      workaround. Not a real fix yet.
    - Remove unnecessary code from the UUID generation roles.
    - In KiokuDB::Cmd::OutputHandle, don't clobber the file before the command
      has actually run (remove EarlyBuild attr)

0.15  2008-12-28
    - Last version was accidentally released off a problematic branch,
      rereleasing without that change

0.14  2008-12-28
    - skip incremental JSON parsing tests if JSON::XS is missing
    - load IO::Handle to attempt to work around some weird test failures

0.13  2008-12-25
    - t/serializer.t was causing bogus failures by not skipping if YAML::XS is
      unavailable
    - Cleanup of ( is => 'rw' ) bits in KiokuDB::Entry that should have really
      had private writers instead
    - Introduce partial handling of anonymous classes created due to runtime
      application of roles ( My::Role->meta->apply($instance) )

0.12  2008-12-24
    - Remove a use Devel::PartialDump that accidentally got committed

0.11  2008-12-24
    - Fetching now queues items so that the backend's get() method is called
      fewer times, with more IDs each time. This significantly increases the
      performance of high latency backends, such as DBI or CouchDB.
    - fill in SimpleSearch stub fixture
    - Various fixes for Binary fixture
    - Make the various fields of the JSPON format customizable
    - Serialization is now pluggable using the Delegate serialization role

0.10  2008-12-22
    - Load classes in the typemap resolution code, so that objects whose
      classes aren't necessarily loaded at compile time can still be inflated.
    - add 'import_yaml' to KiokuDB::Util
    - Refactor parts of the JSPON file backend into a JSON serialization role
    - Don't load thunks when updating partially loaded objects
    - No longer dies if txn_do is used but the backend doesn't supports it
      (implicit noop)
    - Add a new role and test for nested transaction supporting backends
      (partial rollback)

0.09  2008-12-17
    - Remove KiokuDB::Resolver, moving ID assignment functionality into the
      collapser and the typemap
    - Fix bogus failures on 5.8 due to weird leaks (perl bug affecting test suite)

0.08  2008-12-05
    - Fix a breakage in inflating passthrough intrinsic objects created with
      older versions of KiokuDB
    - Refactor command line tools to use App::Cmd
    - Add KiokuDB::LinkChecker and a FSCK command

0.07  2008-10-31
    - Rename backend roles to KiokuDB::Backend::Role::Foo (omega)
    - Change entry packing format in Storable to something less idiotic

0.06  2008-10-31
    - Use epoch, not ISO 8601 dates in JSPON map by default to avoid issues
      with DateTime::Format::ISO8601 dependency in testing. Will support both in the future
    - Fix tied support for JSPON

0.05  2008-10-31
    - Add default typemaps for JSON and Storable serialization

        - Some dependencies weren't necessary
    - Hand written code instead of MooseX::AttributeHelpers in live objects
    - Fixed an random test failure in live_objects.t that accidentally depended
      on address space ordering

    - Lazy meta trait for attributes
    - DoNotSerialize meta trait is now respected
    - Documentation updates
