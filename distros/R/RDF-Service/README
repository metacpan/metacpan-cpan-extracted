NAME
    RDF::Service - The Wraf core library


DESCRIPTION
    Wraf implements a RDF API that hopes to realize the Semantic
    Web. The framework uses RDF for data, user interface, modules and
    object methods. It uses interfaces to other sources in order to
    integrate all data in one enviroment, regardless of storage form.


DOCUMENTATION
    The documentation is far from complete and not up to date.  Send
    any question to the mailinglist rdf@uxn.nu.  Look for comments in
    the source and notes in the ./doc directory.


PREREQUISITIES
    Perl v5.6 with modules Template v2, Time::Hires, CGI, FreezeThaw, DBI,
    DBD::Pg and URI.  PostgreSQL.  Apache v1.3 with mode_usertrack.


INSTALL
    The test program bin/serv1.pl will look for the libraries in
    ../lib (relative to the current directory).  Create the databases
    wraf_v01a in PostgreSQL and initiate it with the tables in
    doc/rdf.sql  Do not 'make install'.


TEST EXAMPLE
    Make the CGI program cgi-bin/client.cgi executable from a webserver.
    Start ./serv1.pl in bin and be amazed at the amount of work needed
    for a simple stupid list of names.  Use cgi-bin/demo.html as a
    starting point.


DEVELOPMENT
    The homepage for Wraf is http://www.uxn.nu/wraf/ there you can
