Perl 5.6.0 or later and Module::Build are required to build this module.
Both Pod::Man and Pod::Text are built on Pod::Simple, which handles the
basic POD parsing and character set conversion.  Pod::Simple 3.06 or later
is required (and Pod::Simple 3.07 is recommended).  It is available from
CPAN and part of Perl core as of 5.10.0.  Encode is also required
(included in Perl core since 5.8.0).

The troff/nroff generated by Pod::Man should be compatible with any troff
or nroff implementation with the `-man` macro set.  It is primarily tested
by me under GNU groff, but Perl users send bug reports for a wide variety
of implementations and Pod::Man is used to generate all of Perl's own
manual pages, so most of the bugs have been weeded out.

The test suite requires Test::More (part of Perl since 5.6.2).  The
following additional Perl modules will be used by the test suite if
present:

* Test::MinimumVersion
* Test::Pod
* Test::Spelling
* Test::Strict
* Test::Synopsis

All are available on CPAN.  Those tests will be skipped if the modules are
not available.
