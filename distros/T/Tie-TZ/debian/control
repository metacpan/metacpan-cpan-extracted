Description: Tied TZ variable and TZ object
 This package has two modules, firstly a Tie::TZ which creates a $TZ
 variable getting and setting $ENV{'TZ'}, and on setting calling
 POSIX::tzset() to ensure C library functions like localtime() notice
 the change.
 .
 And secondly a Time::TZ as an object-oriented TZ string value, with
 methods to make calculations in that zone (through Tie::TZ).
