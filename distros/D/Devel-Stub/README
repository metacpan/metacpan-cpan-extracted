NAME
    Devel::Stub - stub some methods for development purpose

DESCRIPTION
    For example, when you develop a webapp,you'd like to develop views
    and/or controllers using stubbed model modules which can return expected
    data. This module helps it.

    * With this module,you can stub some methods on exisiting moudle

    * This module adds a lib path on initializing the app (when invoked with
      specific environment variable) so that you can organize stub file on
      the path outside of main lib path

    * Changes you have to do on main app are just one line and it doesn't
      affect if you kick the app in usual way. You have to do nothing on
      existing modules.

SYNOPSIS
    The step is; 1) declare Devel::Stub::lib on main applicaton file. 2)
    Overide methods with module which has same pacakge of original one.

  Devel::Stub::lib
    Change lib path for stubbing.

     use lib qw/mylib/;
     use Devel::Stub::lib active_if => $ENV{STUB};
     use Foo::Bar;

    In this case,if $ENV{STUB} are given, this script will add 'stub' to
    @INC.

  Devel::Stub
    Stub some methods on existing module.

    stub/Foo/Bar.pm

      package Foo::Bar;
      use Devel::Stub on => 'mylib';
      # this moudle override methods on mylib/Foo/Bar.pm

      stub foo => sub {
          "stubbed!"
      };

EXAMPLE
    Suppose these files;

      ./app.pl
      ./mylib/Abcd/Efg.pm
      ./mylib/Foo/Bar.pm
      ./stub/Foo/Bar.pm

    app.pl
         use lib 'mylib';
         use Devel::Stub::lib active_if => $ENV{STUB}
         use Foo::Bar;

         my $b = Foo::Bar->new
         print $b->woo;
         print $b->moo;

    mylib/Foo/Bar.pm
         package Foo::Bar

         sub new{
             bless {},shift;
         }
         sub woo{
             "woo!";
         }
         sub moo {
             "moo!"
         }
         1;

    stub/Foo/Bar.pm
         package Foo::Bar;
         use Devel::Stub on => "mylib";

         stub woo => sub {
            "stubbed!";
         };
         # override just 'woo' method. Others are intact.
         1;

    normal use

     $ perl app.pl  #=> woo!moo!

    stub use

     $ STUB=1 perl app.pl #=>stubbed!moo!

PARAMETERS
  Devel::Stub::lib
    EXAMPLE:

     use Devel::Stub::lib 
        active_if => ($ENV{APP_ENV} eq 'development'), path => 'mystub', quiet => 1;

    active_if (optional - default: $ENV{STUB} )
        specify condition for including stub path.

    path (optional - default: 'stub' )
        specify path for stub modules. That will insert on top of @INC

    quite (optional - default: false )
        if true is given,no warning message will be shown when entering stub
        mode.

  Devel::Stub
    EXAMPLE:

      use Devel::Stub on => "mylib"

    on (required)
        specify where original modules are located. That mean if you want to
        stub method in 'foo_lib/Foga/Woo.pm', you should put 'foo_lib'.

WRITING STUBS
    you can define stubs with "stub" method.

      package Foo::Woo;
      use Devel::Stub on => 'mylib'

      stub hoo => sub {
         +{ stubbed => "data"};
      };

  INVOKE ORIGINAL METHOD
    you can invoke original method with "_orginal()".

     stub foo => sub {
       my ($self,$param) = @_;
       if($param ne 'xxx') {
           return _original(@_);  # invoke original one for some situation.
       }  
       ["stubbed","data","is","here"];
     };

  TAG option
    Opionaly,if you specify "TAG" parameter with stub method. That won't be
    activated unless you exec app with STUB_TAG environment.

      stub foo => sub {
        "stubbed!";
      },TAG => ["devel","local"];

      stub 
        TAG => ["staging"],
        moo => sub  {
          "stubbed!";
        };

    with stub file above,

      STUB=1 STUB_TAG=local perl app.pl  # 'foo' is stubbed
      STUB=1 STUB_TAG=staging perl app.pl # 'moo' is stubbed.
      STUB=1 perl app.pl # neither is stubbed.
