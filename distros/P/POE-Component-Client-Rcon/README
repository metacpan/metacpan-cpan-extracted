POE::Component::Client::Rcon is an add-on to the POE framework
to allow easy administrative access to several types of game
servers.

Games known to use the Rcon protocol include Half-Life, all the
versions of Quake, and Return to Castle Wolfenstein.  At this 
point; however, PoCo::Client::Rcon only supports Half-Life
and Quake.  RTCW is supposed to be compatible with Quake, but
I have not been able to test this.

--HISTORY--
This is version 0.23.  Fixed a tiny bit of documentation and
included a sample program.

This is version 0.22.  I forgot to include a got_error() function
to deal with errors.  Oops.

This is version 0.21.  Fixed some documentation and the method
of internally handing out jobids to player queries.  Various
little bugs were also fixed.
