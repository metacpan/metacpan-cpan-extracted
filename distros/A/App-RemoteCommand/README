DESCRIPTION

    App::RemoteCommand is a simple remote command launcher via ssh. The
    features are:

      * execute remote command in parallel

      * remember sudo password first, and never ask again

      * you may specify a script file in local machine

      * append hostname and time to each command output lines

      * report success/fail summary

CAVEATS

    Currently this module assumes you can ssh the target hosts without
    password or passphrase. So if your ssh identity (ssh private key)
    requires a passphrase, please use ssh-agent.
