NAME
    Bio::Cigar - Parse CIGAR strings and translate coordinates to/from
    reference/query

SYNOPSIS
        use 5.014;
        use Bio::Cigar;
        my $cigar = Bio::Cigar->new("2M1D1M1I4M");
        say "Query length is ", $cigar->query_length;
        say "Reference length is ", $cigar->reference_length;
    
        my ($qpos, $op) = $cigar->rpos_to_qpos(3);
        say "Alignment operation at reference position 3 is $op";

DESCRIPTION
    Bio::Cigar is a small library to parse CIGAR strings ("Compact
    Idiosyncratic Gapped Alignment Report"), such as those used in the SAM
    file format. CIGAR strings are a run-length encoding which minimally
    describes the alignment of a query sequence to an (often longer)
    reference sequence.

    Parsing follows the SAM v1 spec
    <http://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/SAMv1.pdf> for the "CIGAR" column.

    Parsed strings are represented by an object that provides a few utility
    methods.

ATTRIBUTES
    All attributes are read-only.

  string
    The CIGAR string for this object.

  reference_length
    The length of the reference sequence segment aligned with the query
    sequence described by the CIGAR string.

  query_length
    The length of the query sequence described by the CIGAR string.

  ops
    An arrayref of "[length, operation]" tuples describing the CIGAR string.
    Lengths are integers, possible operations are below.

   CIGAR operations
    The CIGAR operations are given in the following table, taken from the
    SAM v1 spec:

        Op  Description
        ‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾
        M   alignment match (can be a sequence match or mismatch)
        I   insertion to the reference
        D   deletion from the reference
        N   skipped region from the reference
        S   soft clipping (clipped sequences present in SEQ)
        H   hard clipping (clipped sequences NOT present in SEQ)
        P   padding (silent deletion from padded reference)
        =   sequence match
        X   sequence mismatch

        • H can only be present as the first and/or last operation.
        • S may only have H operations between them and the ends of the string.
        • For mRNA-to-genome alignment, an N operation represents an intron.
          For other types of alignments, the interpretation of N is not defined.
        • Sum of the lengths of the M/I/S/=/X operations shall equal the length of SEQ.

CONSTRUCTOR
  new
    Takes a CIGAR string as the sole argument and returns a new Bio::Cigar
    object.

METHODS
  rpos_to_qpos
    Takes a reference position (origin 1, base-numbered) and returns the
    corresponding position (origin 1, base-numbered) on the query sequence.
    Indels affect how the numbering maps from reference to query.

    In list context returns a tuple of "[query position, operation at
    position]". Operation is a single-character string. See the table of
    CIGAR operations.

    If the reference position does not map to the query sequence (as with a
    deletion, for example), returns "undef" or "[undef, operation]".

  qpos_to_rpos
    Takes a query position (origin 1, base-numbered) and returns the
    corresponding position (origin 1, base-numbered) on the reference
    sequence. Indels affect how the numbering maps from query to reference.

    In list context returns a tuple of "[references position, operation at
    position]". Operation is a single-character string. See the table of
    CIGAR operations.

    If the query position does not map to the reference sequence (as with an
    insertion, for example), returns "undef" or "[undef, operation]".

  op_at_rpos
    Takes a reference position and returns the operation at that position.
    Simply a shortcut for calling "rpos_to_qpos" in list context and
    discarding the first return value.

  op_at_qpos
    Takes a query position and returns the operation at that position.
    Simply a shortcut for calling "qpos_to_rpos" in list context and
    discarding the first return value.
