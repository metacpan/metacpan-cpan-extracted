# This is a configuration file for the smoke tester on OpenVMS.
# $Id$
# Lines starting with # are comments.
# Lines starting with = are section breaks;
# The rest of the line will be ignored.
# This happens to be a section, but because it's *all* just blank lines
# (comments are ignored) this whole section will be ingored.
#
# Each normal line of a section defines a command line argument to Configure
# On OpenVMS case-preserving quoting is done under the hood!
# A blank line in a normal section means an argument of ""
# Each line from the first section is tried with each line of the second
# section with each line of the third section ...
# As this default configuration file has 2 (non-empty) sections with 2
# and 2 lines defining Configure arguments it will build  4 variations of
# perl, each of them will be tested with $PERLIO = "stdio" and "perlio" so
# yielding 8 status letters

# For OpenVMS on VAX you might want to uncomment this section (next 2 lines)
