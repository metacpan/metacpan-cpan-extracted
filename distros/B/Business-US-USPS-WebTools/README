This module provides a Perl interface to the US Postal Service's
Web Tools service. You need a UserID and Password to use these
services. See the Web Tools site for details:

	http://www.usps.com/webtools/

You can set the USPS_WEBTOOLS_USERID and USPS_WEBTOOLS_PASSWORD 
environment variables and the module will pick them up automatically.

I've included some example scripts in the examples/ directory.

You can install this using in the usual Perl fashion

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install

The documentation is in the module file. Once you install
the file, you can read it with perldoc.

	perldoc Business::US::USPS::WebTools

If you want to read it before you install it, you can use
perldoc directly on the module file.

	perldoc  lib/WebTools.pm

This module is also in CVS on SourceForge
