Revision history for Perl extension CGI::Authenticate

1.402 Wed Nov 11 08:57:45 AST 2020
 - bug report: module HTTP::Request::Common is used but not declared
   in Makefile.PL; It is declared now.
 - Note: There are some other module dependencies, which are required
   at runtime and report error if not available. This was done since
   they are not required for core functionality.  Maybe this should be
   fixed and maybe they should be required for the whole module.
