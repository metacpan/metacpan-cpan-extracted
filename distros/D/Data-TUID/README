NAME
    Data::TUID - A smaller and more communicable pseudo-UUID

VERSION
    version 0.0122

SYNOPSIS
        use Data::TUID

        my $tuid = tuid             # Generate a TUID of (default) length 8
        $tuid = tuid length => 4    # Generate a TUID of length 4
        $tuid = Data::TUID->tuid    # Generate a TUID with the default length

        $tuid = tuid uuid => '1bf4d967-9e4c-4414-9be0-26f31c16fb53' # Generate a TUID based off of the given UUID

    A sample run (length 4):

DESCRIPTION
    Data::TUID is a tool for creating small, communicable pseudo-unique
    identifiers. Essentially it will take a UUID, pass the result through
    Encode::Base32::Crockford, and resize accordingly (via "substr")

    Although I've tried to sample the UUID evenly, this technique does not
    give any guarantee on uniqueness. Caveat emptor.

    Finally, the result is more communicable (and smaller) due to the
    Crockford base-32 encoding. The Crockford technique uses:

        A case-insensitive mapping
        1 in place of '1','I', 'i', and 'L'
        0 in place of '0', 'O', and 'o'

    So, given a TUID (say something a user typed in for a URL), you can
    translate ambiguous characters (1, I, i, L, 0, 0, and o) into to 1 and
    0.

USAGE
  Data::TUID->tuid( ... )
  Data::TUID::tuid( ... )
  tuid ...
    The arguments are:

        uuid    The UUID to use as a basis for the TUID. If none is given, one will be generated for you

        length  The length of the TUID returned. By default 8. A length of -1 will result in the whole
                UUID being used, and a variable length TUID being returned (somewhere between 25 to 28)
