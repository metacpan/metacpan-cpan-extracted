          which will be removed in a next version (GH-19).
        - Added document to gather upgrade instructions between versions.
        - Added ability to use real date types for 'created' and 'modified'
          fields (GH-2).
        - Set up mechanism to retrieve and cache schema information, to power
          new features of NinjaORM that rely on knowing the table structures (GH-16).

        - (RT #83514) Don't delete cache if no cache key can be determined.
        - Modified validate_data() to check for existence, not just defineness

        - Fixed detecting invalid filtering criteria [].

v2.3.2  2013-01-27

          Thanks Jennifer Pinkham!

v1.8.4  2012-10-02

        - Added option to trace cache operations.

v1.8.1  2012-09-06
        - Adjusted the order of when we invalidate the object cache in update().
        - Forced the cache keys and values to be lower case, to account for
          case-insensitive collations.

v1.8.0  2012-08-30
        - Implemented cache of the translation from arguments to IDs in
          retrieve_list(). Thanks Kate Kirby for pair programming this change!

v1.7.7  2012-05-22
        - Modified parse_filtering_criteria() to return whether filtering fields
          were detected in the arguments passed to retrieve_list(),
          independently of whether filtering clauses are generated or not.
        - Tweaked retrieve_list() to warn about missing filtering fields only
          when none was passed to retrieve_list(), and ignore the case when all
          of them are undef or empty arrays.

v1.7.6  2012-05-08
        - Improved get() to prevent retrieving private properties and to error
          on non-existent properties only when the object comes from
          retrieve_list() which is guaranteed to populate the object correctly.

v1.7.5  2012-03-20
        - Fixed trying to invalidate the cached object for keys with undefined
          values.

v1.7.4  2012-03-20
        - Added unitary operator 'null'.

v1.7.3  2012-02-24
        - Added get().
        - Added 'ignore' argument to insert(). Thanks Jamie McCarthy!

v1.7.2  2011-08-08
        - Added operator 'between' for retrieve_list(), reengineered the return
          values of build_filtering_clause() to allow for more than one bind
          variable to be returned.

v1.7.1  2011-06-10
        - Added more trace information for cache operations.
        - Modified update() to invalidate cached versions of objects.
        - Added meta information 'cache_key_field' to allow specifying a
          different cache key field than the primary key.
        - Added get_object_cache_key(), to allow subclassing to create complex
          cache keys.

v1.7.0  2011-06-07
        - Refactored filtering operators to use (?:=|not|<=|>=|<|>).
        - Added code to detect parameters that cannot be handled by
          retrieve_list(). This helps the calling code to detect typos, missing
          filtering fields in the static class declaration or obsolete argument
          names.
        - Set up a list of reserved arguments for retrieve_list().
        - Fixed retrieve_list( id => [ 1, 2 ] ) that was converting to
          WHERE id = 1 AND id = 2 instead of WHERE id IN ( 1, 2 ).

v1.6.1  2011-05-17
        - Added last insert ID value to the object upon successful insert.

v1.5.1  2011-01-24
        - Changed retrieve_list() to return pagination info in addition to the
          results only when pagination was requested to begin with.
        - Added option to set "pagination => 1"  in retrieve_list(), as a
          shortcut to get all the defaults.

        - Implemented delete().

        - Simplified 'order_by', removed option to pass a data structure in
          favor of raw SQL.
        - Fixed retrieve_list() to handle the case when the query has joins but

        - Split validation from setting properties.
        - Added concept of read-only fields.
        - Added cached_static_class_info(), which is ~6x faster than
          static_class_info().

v1.3.0  2010-12-16
        - Added 'unique_fields' to the meta object information and created a
          method to access it.
        - Simplified caching of objects.
        - Expanded parse_filtering_criteria() to allow filtering on the opposite
          of a criteria.
        - Implemented pagination for retrieve_list().
        - Refactored how cache keys are generated.
        - Added invalidate_cached_object() to remove all the cached versions of
          a given object.
        - Added 'lock' and 'allow_all' arguments to retrieve_list().
        - Added option to specify pre-generated primary keys in insert().
        - Added warnings to prevent hash/hashref confusion in the first argument
          of insert() and update()
        - Fixed insert() to work with tables that don't have a primary key.
        - Added unique fields to the list of available filtering criteria in
          retrieve_list().
        - Improved 'order_by' parsing and defaults in retrieve_list(), allowed
          raw SQL in 'order_by'.
        - Modified update() to accept restrictions on the where clause.
