=head1 DESCRIPTION

The C<git-watch> command allows you to run a command when something changes.
The simple option is C<show> which just shows what has changed when it changes
and nothing else, this is useful for seeing what is happening in the
repository. The the C<do> sub-command actually runs a script every time a
change is detected.

=head2 show

The output of C<show> is changed with the C<--quiet> and C<--verbose> options to
show more or less information.

=head2 do

When the C<do> sub-command runs it sets the environment variables C<$WATCH_SHA>,
C<$WATCH_FILES> and C<$WATCH_BRANCHES> with the latest commit SHA, the files
that have changed and the branches that have changed respectively. The files
and branches are comma separated for your command to inspect.

A simple example:

  git watch 'echo $WATCH_FILES'

This would just echo the files that have changed with each change.

=head2 Notes

If trying to watch a branch that is connected to a remote branch the C<--pull>
isn't currently working as expected. The workaround is to watch the remote
branch and do the pull your self. eg

 $ git watch do -rb origin/master -- 'git pull --ff -r; your-command'
