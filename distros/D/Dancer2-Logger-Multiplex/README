NAME

    Dancer2::Logger::Multiplex - Log to multiple Dancer2::Logger engines

VERSION

    version 0.02

SYNOPSIS

      use Dancer2::Logger::Multiplex;

DESCRIPTION

    Implements a multiplexing logger engine to dispatch logs to multiple
    backend Dancer2::Core::Role::Logger engines.

METHODS

 log($level, $message)

    Writes the log message to multiple logger engines.

CONFIGURATION

    The setting logger should be set to Multiplex in order to use this
    logging engine in a Dancer2 application.

    Below is a sample configuration:

      logger: "Multiplex"
    
      engines:
        logger:
          Multiplex:
            loggers:
              - Console
              - File
              - Fluent
          File:
            log_dir: "/var/log/myapp"
            file_name: "myapp.log"
          Fluent:
            tag_prefix: "myapp"
            host: "127.0.0.1"
            port: 24224

    Allowed options are as follows:

    loggers

      Specifies the list of Dancer2::Core::Role::Logger backend engines to
      dispatch log messages to.

      Each logger engine will be initialized with their corresponding
      configurations. As such, in the example above, Dancer2::Logger::File
      will be initialized with settings for log_dir and file_name, while
      Dancer2::Logger::Fluent will be initialized with settings for
      tag_prefix, host, and port as specified in the sample configuration.
