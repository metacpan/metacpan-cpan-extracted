 - (Abe Timmerman, Wed, 25 Oct 2023 19:54:55 +0200) Add support for
   Cpanel::JSON::XS
 - We should also support Cpanel::JSON::XS, dunno if speed is a thing
 - here...
 - Nicked 'JSON' from JSON::MaybeXS
 - (Abe Timmerman, Fri, 27 Oct 2023 09:24:40 +0200) Open new development
   branch
 - (Abe Timmerman, Mon, 30 Oct 2023 09:44:25 +0100) Merge branch
   'feature/cpanel-json-xs' into development
 - (Abe Timmerman, Wed, 25 Oct 2023 20:33:16 +0200) Add a Queue for reports
   to repost
 - Post reports to the API-funcion (https://$host/api/report)
 - Archiving *must* be used (adir set)
 - The qfile holds the commit-id's for each report to resend for the
 - archive
 - This is WorkInProgress:
 - bin/tshandle_queue.pl
 - Test::Smoke::App::HandleQueue
 - (Abe Timmerman, Thu, 26 Oct 2023 17:21:58 +0200) Add the queue handler
   mechanism
 - (Abe Timmerman, Fri, 27 Oct 2023 17:16:36 +0200) FIX: MSWin32 cmd uses
   'REM' for comments
 - (Abe Timmerman, Sat, 28 Oct 2023 18:15:22 +0200) FIX, commas between
   arguments...
 - (Abe Timmerman, Sat, 28 Oct 2023 18:16:12 +0200) Add a question about
   the new qfile.
 - After we have determined that both archiving and posting to Perl5
 - CoreSmokeDB is configured, we can ask about qfile.
 - (Abe Timmerman, Fri, 27 Oct 2023 10:12:47 +0200) Make Test::Smoke
   installable as regular Perl module
 - In the past, most users of the software wanted the software installed in
 - a separate directory, but we never created an easy way to install as a
 - regular Perl module. This change makes it posible to do so:
 - $ SMOKE_INST_SITE_LIB=1 perl Makefile.PL
 - or
 - $ perl Makefile.PL --site-lib
 - Installing as a regular Perl module makes the scripts and documentation
 - more readily available.
 - (Abe Timmerman, Mon, 30 Oct 2023 10:12:52 +0100) All .pm files should
   have `our $VERSION = '...';`
 - Added the version in some files, changed the `use vars...` also to `our`
 - in other files.
 - (Abe Timmerman, Wed, 22 Nov 2023 14:01:07 +0100) FIX: t/poster-post.t
 - the test was looking for "darwin", which is fine on my mac, but goes
 - very wrong on all other platforms. Look for `$^O`, that's what we use as
 - input in the test.
 - (Abe Timmerman, Mon, 8 Jan 2024 15:51:28 +0100) RT#151070: README not
   clear enough (and outdated)
 - We have switched to `tsconfigsmoke.pl` since 1.80, so the documentation
 - should reflect that.
 - (H.Merijn Brand - Tux, Sat, 27 Apr 2024 12:46:15 +0200) Skip unused
   lines in legenda for perlio_only report
 - (Abe Timmerman, Sat, 27 Apr 2024 16:16:54 +0100) Merge branch

   distribution Test-Smoke 1.80_05 (test)
 - (Abe Timmerman, Mon, 23 Oct 2023 23:27:43 +0200) Restore the default
   'smokecurrent' for config-prefix
 - (Abe Timmerman, Tue, 24 Oct 2023 12:22:27 +0200) Default build configs
   should be OS dependend
 - We have these example/default build configurations files in the
 - distribution, so we should use them during configsmoke.
 - (Abe Timmerman, Tue, 24 Oct 2023 12:25:47 +0200) FIX some POD.
 - (Abe Timmerman, Tue, 24 Oct 2023 13:16:31 +0200) Remove configsmoke.pl,
   add configsmoke.pod and README2.md
 - We have gathered all the information from the old `configsmoke.pl` and
 - put it in a new `configsmoke.pod` file, this file is converted to
 - README2.md
 - (Abe Timmerman, Tue, 24 Oct 2023 17:58:41 +0200) Make sure
   'configsmoke.pod' is installed on make install
 - We refer to that documentation, so it should be available after
 - installation.
 - Also regenerate the README2.md

1.80_04 2023-10-19T13:53:17+02:00 (120827f => Abe Timmerman)
 - (Abe Timmerman, Thu, 19 Oct 2023 13:53:17 +0200) Autocommit for
   distribution Test-Smoke 1.80_04 (test)
 - (Abe Timmerman, Sat, 21 Oct 2023 14:34:34 +0200) Change test a bit: more
   diagnostics
 - (Abe Timmerman, Sat, 21 Oct 2023 14:35:43 +0200) Remove extra print of
   answer in prompt_yn()
 - Although this was the correct(ed) answer for a Yes/No question, it was
 - rather irritating to see the "Got ..." twice and it didn't contribute to
 - clarity.
 - (Abe Timmerman, Sat, 21 Oct 2023 14:38:39 +0200) Improve
   MSWin32-schtasks cron handling
 - We now look if we can find an existing entry in the schedule for this
 - task. If it exists we warn about it and add " /F" to the command to
 - force changes to the schedule.
 - Also the add2cron-option gets improved defaults handling.

1.80_03 2023-10-17T12:08:02+02:00 (b6eaf1f => Abe Timmerman)
 - (Abe Timmerman, Tue, 17 Oct 2023 12:08:02 +0200) Autocommit for
   distribution Test-Smoke 1.80_03 (test)
 - (Abe Timmerman, Thu, 19 Oct 2023 11:23:39 +0200) Change the syncer_git
   test a bit
 - Use a bare repo for upstream and edit stuff in a working clone
 - Add some diagnostics
 - Smoothen the set-up flow a bit
 - (Abe Timmerman, Thu, 19 Oct 2023 11:25:48 +0200) FIX: Some MSWin32
   scheduler and smoke-script stuff
 - Change the name of the Task for MS schtasks (include prefix)
 - Add a note about querying MS schtasks in the .cmd
 - Make the .sh and .cmd version equal wrt. PATH
 - keep the PATH that was set during tsconfigsmoke.pl
 - (Abe Timmerman, Thu, 19 Oct 2023 13:38:17 +0200) FIX: ConfigSmoke stuff
 - The MSWin32 schtasks wasn't used correctly
 - Use of the wrong variable in write_as_<shell|bat>()

1.80_02 2023-10-15T11:47:28+02:00 (4448a59 => Abe Timmerman)

   distribution Test-Smoke 1.80_02 (test)
 - (Abe Timmerman, Tue, 17 Oct 2023 10:00:23 +0200) Add t/syncer_git.t that
   got forgotten
 - (Abe Timmerman, Tue, 17 Oct 2023 10:01:44 +0200) FIX: iffy rounding test
   by adding more digits
 - (Abe Timmerman, Tue, 17 Oct 2023 10:03:31 +0200) Update the
   example-config for MSWin32
 - We now have 64-bit and loads of other stuff.
 - Test::Smoke::Util::Configure_win32() was updated to understand more
 - switches, this is reflected here.
 - (Abe Timmerman, Tue, 17 Oct 2023 11:47:27 +0200) There seem to be more
   ways to set a proxy
 - After more failing tests with a proxy, it turns out `ALL_PROXY` is also
 - looked at by HTTP::Tiny (and in both upper- and lower-case).

1.80_01 2023-10-13T22:12:09+02:00 (7ea15ed => Abe Timmerman)
 - (Abe Timmerman, Fri, 13 Oct 2023 22:12:09 +0200) Autocommit for
   distribution Test-Smoke 1.80_01 (test)
 - (Abe Timmerman, Sat, 14 Oct 2023 13:53:36 +0200) Make sure we always use
   (double) quotes(")
 - Commands and arguments that contain spaces or are allready delimited,
 - should always go out to the "shell" with quotes(") (not apostrophes(')).
 - (Abe Timmerman, Sat, 14 Oct 2023 19:57:41 +0200) FIX: GitHubIssue #78
 - The `sprintf()` rounds-up all numbers with a fraction-bit >= 0.5, so it
 - can round-up to 60 again. We now check that and correct.
 - (Abe Timmerman, Sat, 14 Oct 2023 20:01:55 +0200) Merge branch
   'metacpan-20230214' of https://github.com/jkeenan/Test-Smoke into

1.80 2023-05-01T08:56:06+02:00 (3b74d8a => Abe Timmerman)
 - (Abe Timmerman, Mon, 1 May 2023 08:56:06 +0200) Autocommit for
   distribution Test::Smoke 1.80 (minor)
 - (Abe Timmerman, Tue, 9 May 2023 13:54:24 +0200) Split the 'building' of
   the commandline from run()
 - We didn't properly quote the command or arguments - a quoted command was
 - re-quoted - this undos the quoting on MSWin32 and makes commands with
 - spaces break.
 - We have now split off the building of the command line from the run
 - method in order to test it properly.
 - (Abe Timmerman, Tue, 9 May 2023 13:59:54 +0200) Use quote-meta for paths
 - On MSWin32 the backslash (\) path-separator is interpreted as the escape
 - char, this messes up the regex for matching them. We'll quote-meta the
 - paths for the test.
 - (Abe Timmerman, Tue, 9 May 2023 14:03:05 +0200) Remove HTTPS?_PROXY
   while running the test
 - A test-failure showing a 403 from a squid-proxy makes me think we need
 - to temporarily remove the ENVironment variables HTTP_PROXY and
 - HTTPS_PROXY if set.
 - (Abe Timmerman, Tue, 9 May 2023 14:07:33 +0200) Use tempdir() for new
   target dirs
 - We shouldn't use the 't/' directory for targeting our destinations, a
 - tempdir() is nicer and most likely always writable.
 - Also add a test for the UNCify_path() function.
 - (Abe Timmerman, Tue, 27 Jun 2023 16:28:30 +0200) Create option to skip
   PERLIO=stdio
 - On some platforms - e.g. HP-UX - stdio will not ever work again, we need
 - a way to run the test suite without the stdio option. This will create
 - problems for the reporter, but we will have to solve them in stage 2 of
 - this change.
 - (Abe Timmerman, Fri, 30 Jun 2023 14:35:44 +0200) Fix: Reporter and
   Smoker
 - Smoker: multi-locale
 - Reporter: no-stdio
 - (Abe Timmerman, Tue, 10 Oct 2023 14:27:52 +0200) FIX: some MSWin32 stuff
 - mistakes in MSWin32 (ConfigSmoke)
 - Syncer::Git -> MSWin32 needs an extra option for clone:
 - `--config core.autocrlf input`
 - (Abe Timmerman, Thu, 12 Oct 2023 18:22:54 +0200) Add -Accflags='' and
   -Aldflags='' for MSWin32
 - take into account that textfiles are now checked out without CRLF in
 - git
 - -Accflags='' to add compiler flags: sets BUILDOPTEXTRA
 - -Aldflags='' to add linker flags: sets LINK_FLAGSEXTRA
 - (Abe Timmerman, Fri, 13 Oct 2023 19:46:11 +0200) FIX: --config
   core.autocrlf
 - This needs an '=' inbetween the name and value for `git clone`
 - (Abe Timmerman, Fri, 13 Oct 2023 19:49:46 +0200) Update
   Configure_win32()
 - Add -Dprefix as alias for -DINST_TOP which does the same
 - Reimplement -Accflags to set BUILDOPTEXTRA
 - Add -Aldflags=... and make it set PRIV_LINK_FLAGS
 - (Abe Timmerman, Fri, 13 Oct 2023 19:57:03 +0200) FIX: we don't need
   quotes in result of whereis()
 - Commands with a space in their path/name should no longer have
 - delimiting quotes, this is taken care of in Test::Smokke::Util::Execute
 - (Abe Timmerman, Fri, 13 Oct 2023 20:10:45 +0200) Merge branch
   'fix/mswin32-configure' into development
 - (Abe Timmerman, Fri, 13 Oct 2023 21:47:17 +0200) FIX: POD, remove =back
   without =over
 - (Abe Timmerman, Fri, 13 Oct 2023 21:48:13 +0200) We're starting a new
   beta cycle
 - (Abe Timmerman, Fri, 13 Oct 2023 21:48:56 +0200) FIX: tests for
   -Accflags
 - Now that we have reimplemented -Accflags to set BUILDOPTEXTRA
 - (introduced in 2005) we need to fix the test-makefiles and tests
 - (Abe Timmerman, Fri, 13 Oct 2023 22:04:12 +0200) Merge branch
   'feature/no-stdio' into development
 - (Abe Timmerman, Fri, 13 Oct 2023 22:09:09 +0200) Exclude "perlio_only"
   from pod-coverage in xt/03-pod-coverage.t

 - (Abe Timmerman, Sun, 30 Apr 2023 13:18:23 +0200) Fix some
   ExtUtils::MakeMaker problems
 - PERL_MM_OPT='INSTALL_BASE=...' interferes with our use of PREFIX, we
 - now take that into account (and honour INSTALL_BASE)
 - Set a minimum version for ExtUtils::MakeMaker to 6.55_03
 - (BUILD_REQUIRES)

1.79_08 2023-04-27T10:14:41+02:00 (9889db4 => Abe Timmerman)
 - (Abe Timmerman, Thu, 27 Apr 2023 10:14:41 +0200) Change the default
   poster module to HTTP::Tiny
 - The default for config is HTTP::Tiny, but the "sane default" was
 - LWP::UserAgent, this is now also HTTP::Tiny.
 - (Abe Timmerman, Sat, 29 Apr 2023 11:43:52 +0200) tsrepostjsn.pl: add
   option to re-post a specific file
 - We now have a new option '--jsonreport' that lets one post a specific
 - file to the reports server.
 - Also fixed a bug for the case where no '--configfile' was specified and
 - the 'configfile_error' attribute didn't exist.
 - (Abe Timmerman, Sat, 29 Apr 2023 14:22:38 +0200) BUGFIX:
   https://github.com/abeltje/Test-Smoke/issues/74
 - Older 'curl' versions (before 7.68.0) needed the '--globoff' switch to
 - make the IPv6 syntax for [::1] work. We now check the version of curl to
 - see if we need to add the switch.
 - See also commit: f4b90b293a2e163f49b55fa2996a6368115e08b9
 - (Abe Timmerman, Sat, 29 Apr 2023 15:10:33 +0200) Add 'curlargs' to
   exceptions
 - New app-options should be excluded from the pod-coverage test, they are
 - not documented in POD.

 - Duseithreads (e before a)
 - (Bram, Tue, 30 Aug 2022 22:13:13 +0200) Fix
   `Test::Smoke::Util::set_local_patch`
 - The `set_local_patch` function got 'broken' when the 'patchlevel.h'
 - in the perl5 repo got detabified (committed on 17 Jan 2021).
 - It no longer worked because the code was using: `/\t,NULL/`
 - That worked fine when the tabs were used for indentation but it
 - got silently broken when the tabs were replaces with spaces.
 - (Bram, Tue, 30 Aug 2022 23:02:54 +0200) Update 'patchlevel.h' file used
   in the test
 - This was using an old patchlevel.h file, update it to a more
 - recent version.
 - Also add xt/perl/git_version.h, this is used by xt/perl/patchlevel.h
 - and is needed for the compiling tests. (Without tests in xt/ fail.)
 - (Bram, Tue, 30 Aug 2022 23:08:10 +0200) Patch the patchlevel.h copy
 - Other test still expect the old format of patchlevel.h which
 - contains a patchnum... Even the number is important for the
 - tests...
 - So re-add the patchnum and remove 'uncommitted-changes' (the tests
 - can't deal with it..)
 - Another option would be to clean up the other tests but that is
 - a bigger task...
 - (Abe Timmerman, Thu, 1 Sep 2022 09:10:29 +0200) carp() when setting
   local patch fails
 - This code was silently broken for about 20 months because
 - patchlevel.h was detabified.
 - To avoid the same problem in the future: carp() when adding
 - the local patch to patchlevel.h fails we should keep an eye on the
 - logfiles.

   'bram-perl-bram/windows-git-test-fixes'
 - (Abe Timmerman, Fri, 2 Sep 2022 11:53:18 +0200) Add USE_MINGW_ANSI_STDIO
   as default for Configure_win32()
 - https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/20214
 - I guess this is a case of "Doctor, it hurts when I do this...". We'll
 - just switch it on (it won't hurt MSVC and benefits gcc) and provide and
 - escape with `-UUSE_MINGW_ANSI_STDIO`. We should aim to build the best
 - possible Perl on Windows that we can imo.
 - (Abe Timmerman, Sun, 4 Sep 2022 20:48:14 +0200) New helper programme:
   tsrepostjsn.pl
 - Sometimes the reportserver isn't there or won't accept a report, now,
 - one can repost that report with this tool.
 - It can be interactive and will look in the archive directory (adir) for
 - the jsn files one wants to resend.
 - (Abe Timmerman, Mon, 5 Sep 2022 11:05:47 +0200) Also install the new
   tsrepostjsn.pl script
 - I forgot to put it in the EXE_FILES key for WriteMakefile().

 - dmake.exe is no longer supported where gmake.exe is, so we drop the

 - (Abe Timmerman, Tue, 30 Aug 2022 10:18:05 +0200) FIX: Configure_win32()

 - With the introduction of gmake on MSWin32 Configure_win32() has been
 - broken quite badly (assignments went from `*=` in dmake to `:=` in
 - gmake; the regexen didn't look at that).
 - I've also introduced more Configure switches to the platform:
 - CHANGE:
 - Duseithreads is now on by default,
 - Uuseithreads to switch it explicitly off
 - FIX:
 - UWIN64 now works as it should
 - ADD:
 - Duse64bitint   (-UWIN64)
 - Duselongdouble (gcc)
 - Dusequadmath   (gcc)
 - Dusesitecustomize
 - Udefault_inc_excludes_dot
 - (Abe Timmerman, Tue, 30 Aug 2022 11:28:49 +0200) Put the compiler
   messages in the .out-file
 - https://github.com/abeltje/Test-Smoke/issues/54
 - Test::Smoke was relying on the logfile (created from STDOUT and STDERR
 - redirecting) for its compilermessages. I now moved them to the .out-file
 - which should be more reliable - and adjusted the calls to `grepccmsg`
 - and `grepnonfatal`.

 - (Bram, Thu, 18 Aug 2022 18:20:12 +0200) Remove test repository when
   rsync isn't found
 - In t/syncer_rsync.t a fixed test directory (t/tsgit) is used.
 - At the end of the test it normally removes this directory but when
 - some of the tests are skipped then it left this directory in place
 - which caused the next test run to have a failure (on `git commit`).
 - Alternative fixes:
 - use a tmp dir like t/syncer_git.t does
 - remove the directory at the start of the test if it exist
 - (Bram, Thu, 18 Aug 2022 18:19:54 +0200) Configure git user/emailaddress
   for the test repo
 - The test create their own git repo and then adds some files in it and
 - then it does a `git commit`.
 - On Windows the `git commit` failed because it was unable to determine a
   valid
 - username/email-address. This resulted in extra test failures.
 - > After creating a repo set a username and emailaddress in the config of
 - that repo.
 - (Bram, Thu, 18 Aug 2022 18:18:30 +0200) Abort tests when chdir to repo
   dir failed
 - The test init their own git repo and then does a `chdir()` to that
 - directory.
 - If that `chdir()` would fail then abort the test since it would/could
   otherwise
 - be modifying the Test-Smoke repo.
 - (I haven't seen failures with `chdir()`, it's more a safe-guard to
   prevent
 - against altering the wrong repo)
 - (Using `die` instead of `skip` at the request of @abeltje)
 - (Bram, Thu, 18 Aug 2022 18:18:23 +0200) Check exit status of every git

   report
 - On my Windows laptop System::Info reports the cpu_type as 'AMD64'.
 - Looking at the smoke db: other platforms appear to report it as 'amd64'.
 - Lowercase it so that the Windows reports also show as 'amd64'.
 - (Bram, Thu, 18 Aug 2022 22:39:31 +0200) Add '.mailmap' to ignore list of
   MANIFEST check
 - The '.mailmap' file is not included in the MANIFEST, it's also
 - special cased in perl5.git/t/porting/manifest.t.
 - The manifest test of Test::Smoke should also ignore it.
 - All reports currently contain:
 - MANIFEST messages:
 - MANIFEST did not declare '.mailmap'
 - which is irrelevant noise.
 - (Bram, Fri, 19 Aug 2022 13:37:52 +0200) Filter out the default msg in
   `user_skiped_tests`
 - `bin/configsmoke.pl` adds a default message when creating the 'skip
   tests' file.
 - Filter out that message in the report to reduce some 'useless' info.
 - For reference: the 'skip tests' file is used by
   `...::Smoker::set_skip_tests`
 - which does some more filtering (skip comments, ...).
 - Exact Filtering that it does:
 - $raw =~ m/^\s*#/ and next;
 - $raw =~ s/(\S+).*/$1/s;
 - if ($raw !~ m/\.t$/ and $raw !~ m/test\.pl$/) {
 - next;
 - }
 - I opted not to do the same filtering and instead just filter the default
 - message. If there are comments in the file then they could be useful
 - to include in the report (i.e. if they explain why a test file is
   skipped)

 - (Bram, Mon, 15 Aug 2022 21:07:39 +0200) Include custom hostname in smoke
   report
 - In commit 5920e4cbcef17d7b00206d52dddd5b8ba33aafea
 - Author: abeltje <abeltje@test-smoke.org>
 - Date:   Fri Apr 20 22:38:11 2018 +0200
 - Solve https://github.com/abeltje/Test-Smoke/pull/37
 - I don't like using ENVironment vars for legitimate settings in the
 - software, so I'd rather use the configfile for that.
 - Add a question in  configsmoke.pl
 - The option was added to set a custom hostname in the configfile.
 - In that commit the custom hostname is used when sending the report to
 - the smokedb (that is: in `Test::Smoke::Reporter::smokedb_data`).
 - But the hostname is also used in the preamble of the report and that
 - code was left unchanged so the real hostname still leaked in the report.
 - Fix this and (also) use the custom hostname in the `preamble` function.
 - (+ add a test for it, test file is based on t/report-usernote.t)
 - (Note: commit 5920e4c was based on a PR and in the original commit
 - the preamble function was also updated. That part of the
 - change got lost when converting it to a config option.)
 - (Bram, Mon, 15 Aug 2022 21:24:06 +0200) Use `done_testing()` in
   t/report-usernote.t
 - The test file was added in commit
   792da5b7176f3141f5c45e54e16a4fa1d0b34230
 - Author: Abe Timmerman <abeltje@diefenbaker.local>
 - Date:   Mon Apr 15 00:27:00 2013 +0200
 - Implement variable position for the user_note:
 - un_position == 'top' => at the start of the report
 - un_position == <!top> => at the end of the report
 - My guess: `done_testing()` was commented support older perls (with an
 - oder versions of  Test::More which lacked support for it).
 - Today: plenty of other files in the repo are using `done_testing()` so
 - there is no reason why t/report-usernote.t shouldn't be using it.
 - (Bram, Thu, 18 Aug 2022 16:00:55 +0200) Skip tests with git when `git
   init fails`
 - When `git init` failed then the test would continue which is
   undesirable.
 - When running `make test` in the Test-Smoke git repo I observed:
 - `git init` failed (because of the '-b' option, unknown in my git
   version)
 - there was a test failure since it checks the exit code
 - it continues running git commands, including `git commit`
 - Result: changes were committed to the Test-Smoke git repo and *not* to
   the
 - test repo that is normally used inside the test.
 - Fix this by skipping the git tests when `git init` fails.
 - (Bram, Thu, 18 Aug 2022 16:07:57 +0200) Silence default branch name
   warning
 - On a more recent version of git there is a warning about the
 - default branch name. The warning can be silenced by
 - using the '-b' option to set a (different) default branch name
 - using the '-q' option
 - In commit 0f7ceb8c4aa1f2f64a14b86f2fcbef32c7981787 the '-b' option
 - was added to `git init` but that breaks compatibility with older git
 - versions. These do not know the '-b' option and thus fail.
 - To preserve backwards and future compatibility:
 - use the '-q' option to silence the warning
 - use `git -c init.defaultBranch=master init` to ensure the default branch
 - name is master for the test repo.
 - (Older git versions use 'master' by default, newer versions currently
 - use 'master' but that may change in the future. So git-upstream decides
 - to change default name then the '-c' should do the trick to keep it as
 - 'master')

 - (Abe Timmerman, Tue, 12 May 2020 20:54:37 +0200) Autocommit for
   distribution Test::Smoke 1.76 (minor)
 - (H.Merijn Brand, Tue, 23 Apr 2019 15:47:51 +0200) Add support for -Uxx
   and -Dxx=y on tssmokeperl.pl
 - When a smokescript smokes for two different compilers, it is likely to
   use
 - something like
 - :
 - /pro/bin/perl tssmokeperl.pl --nofetch --nopatch \
 - c "$CFGNAME" $continue $* -Dcc=gcc > p59.log 2>&1
 - :
 - :
 - /pro/bin/perl tssmokeperl.pl --nofetch --nopatch \
 - c "$CFGNAME" $continue $* -Dcc=g++ > p59.log 2>&1
 - :
 - This change allows tssmokeperl.pl to accept -Dcc=gcc and/or -Ucc
 - and make it DWIM. Before this change, these command-line options
 - were silently ignored.
 - Only existing options can be (un)set
 - (H.Merijn Brand - Tux, Thu, 25 Apr 2019 11:55:40 +0200) Moving -Dxx=...
   and -Uxx to the correct spot
 - (H.Merijn Brand - Tux, Thu, 25 Apr 2019 12:25:25 +0200) Also allow -A
   options
 - (Abe Timmerman, Wed, 13 May 2020 15:18:21 +0200) Add a Serialiser
 - This is a simple serialiser, I still have to hunt the rest of the code
 - for uses of Data::Dumper type serialisations and see if I can change
 - them.
 - (Abe Timmerman, Wed, 13 May 2020 15:23:03 +0200) Add a '--pass_option'
   switch to the runsmoke-applet
 - This (repeatable) option will let one pass extra options to Configure
 - from the 'tsrunsmoke.pl' (and thus 'tssmokeperl.pl') commandline:
 - ~/coresmoke/ts/bin/tssmokeperl.pl -c "$CFGNAME" $* \
 - -pass-option '-Dusesuperthreads' \
 - p '-Uusesuperfiles' > p59.log 2>&1
 - This is what Tux put in a commit message for a different solution of
 - his own request:
 - When a smokescript smokes for two different compilers, it is likely to
 - use something like
 - /pro/bin/perl tssmokeperl.pl --nofetch --nopatch \
 - c "$CFGNAME" $continue $* -Dcc=gcc > p59.log 2>&1
 - /pro/bin/perl tssmokeperl.pl --nofetch --nopatch \
 - c "$CFGNAME" $continue $* -Dcc=g++ > p59.log 2>&1
 - This change allows tssmokeperl.pl to accept -Dcc=gcc and/or -Ucc
 - and make it DWIM. Before this change, these command-line options
 - were silently ignored.

 - (H.Merijn Brand - Tux, Wed, 6 Nov 2019 14:21:04 +0100) Ignore all

 - As we are only interested in the branch (first field), the sha and the
 - describe (last two fields), just take those and ignore everything in
 - between, so we cannot be fooled by (missing) time-zones or date formats
 - that do not match our expectation

 - (James E Keenan, Wed, 8 Aug 2018 09:42:01 -0400) Report all failing unit
   tests and sequences thereof.
 - The 'log' and 'out' files were correctly identifying failed unit tests
   and
 - sequences thereof, e.g.:
 - ../lib/locale.t.............................................FAILED
 - 436-437, 441, 444, 458
 - However, only the first of these was being captured by
 - Test::Smoke::Reporter::_parse() -- called from within
 - Test::Smoke::Reporter::read_parse() -- and, hence, only the first was
 - available for recording in the 'jsn' file:
 - "failures" : [
 - {
 - "status" : "FAILED",
 - "extra" : [
 - "436-437"
 - ],
 - "test" : "../lib/locale.t"
 - }
 - ],
 - And since it is the 'jsn' file that is sent to the CoreSmoke database --
   from
 - which the web display draws its data -- the web page was only showing
   this:
 - Test failures:
 - ~~ ../lib/locale.t ................................ FAILED 436-437
 - Cf. http://perl5.test-smoke.org/report/68034
 - This commit improves the regex capturing the numbers of failing unit
   tests and
 - sequences of such tests.  In t/reporter.t one block of tests similar to

 - Test-Smoke-1.42 fails to detect the ccversion for my MSVC++
 - installations, which all reside under "C:\Program Files\...". It tries
 - to run a command like
 - "$map{ $CC }->{ccbin}" --version 2>&1
 - but the 'ccbin' there comes from whereis() and is already double-quoted
 - if it contains spaces, which causes an error like
 - '""C:\Program' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
 - operable program or batch file.
 - The attached patch fixes this.

   of Test::Harness in core
 - Sometimes a "_nm" release of Test::Harness in blead, we need to deal
 - with it. eval("$version") seems the easiest way.

 - (abeltje, Sat, 13 May 2017 18:17:43 +0200) Fix test syncer_rsync.t for
   Windows
 - (Cygwin)rsync doesn't understand Windows-paths (C:\Some\Path) but it
   handles UNC-paths (//localhost/C$/Some/Path), so we fix the test.
 - Left the actual code unchanged, as we normally rsync from a remote path.

 - fake source-tree

 - the normal tests. The tests for the logging Module now fix the timezone
 - at UTC
 - (Abe Timmerman, Mon, 20 Apr 2015 10:56:03 +0200) Test FIX: Do not rely
   on textual $!, use numbers

 - @INC, not interested in the rest of @INC.
 - (Abe Timmerman, Tue, 5 May 2015 10:56:03 +0200) TestFIX: problem with
   IPv6
 - It lookes like HTTP::Daemon->url resolves back to IPv6 on my machine,
 - and the client gets a 'Connection refused', so now we replace the
 - host-name with 127.0.0.1, that seems to work for the moment. See what
 - CPANtesters make of that.

 - (abeltje, Thu, 14 Apr 2011 18:48:45 +0000) * [MERGE] from maint
 - This change was integrated into the maint-branch without any
   commit-message.
 - It makes sure that absolute paths are just that, by using
   Cwd::abs_path(), important for symlinks and stuff on windows (but forgot
   what).
