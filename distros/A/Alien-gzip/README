NAME

    Alien::gzip - Find or build gzip

VERSION

    version 0.06

SYNOPSIS

     use Alien::gzip;
     use Env qw( @PATH );
     
     # Add gzip to the path if it isn't there already
     push @PATH, Alien::gzip->bin_dir;

DESCRIPTION

    Many environments provide the gzip command, but a few do not. Using
    this module in your Build.PL (or elsewhere) you can make sure that gzip
    will be available. If the system provides it, then great, this module
    is a no-op. If it does not, then it will download and install it into a
    private location so that it can be added to the PATH when this module
    is used.
