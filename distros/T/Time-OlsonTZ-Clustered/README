DESCRIPTION
    There are over 400 Olson time zone names (e.g. "America/New_York")
    describing current and historical offset and daylight-savings behavior.
    While this is essential for accurate calculations involving times in the
    past, it is an overwhelming list to present as part of a user experience
    current behavior is relevant. (E.g. "Choose your time zone")

    For example, China has had only one official time (UTC+8) since 1949,
    but there are five Olson time zones corresponding to historical
    districts:

        Asia/Shanghai
        Asia/Chongqing
        Asia/Kashgar
        Asia/Urumqi
        Asia/Harbin

    When presenting a list of time zone choices, there are many situations
    in which it is sufficient to present "Asia/Shanghai" for China.
    Likewise, the United States has consolidated some of its historically
    fragmented time zone observance. Instead of asking someone if they are
    in "America/Indiana/Indianapolis", it is sufficient to ask them to pick
    "America/New_York" (a.k.a. "US Eastern Time").

    This module provides a pre-calculated clustering the 400+ Olson time
    zones by country and by time observance behavior, allowing a
    consolidated list of "primary zones" to be offered for each country.

    The clustering was developed using the following heuristics and
    modifications:

    *   For each country, cluster time zones by observance behavior

    *   Zones cluster together if they have the same UTC offset at local
        noon for the next 365 days

    *   If a cluster contains multiple zones, the author selected a primary
        zone using research and judgment

    *   Multiple-zone clusters were given a descriptive name

    Cluster descriptions were based on either the primary zone description
    (the Olson 'region_description' field) -- e.g. "McMurdo Station, Ross
    Island" for the cluster containing "Antartica/McMurdo" and
    "Antarctica/South_Pole" -- or else a subjectively-determined, broadly
    descriptive term common across the zones -- e.g. "Central time" for
    various US zones with a UTC-6 offset.

    When a country had a single cluster, the cluster description was left
    blank, similar to how the Olson database leaves the time zone
    description blank. (N.B. the "primary_zones()" function returns the
    country name when there is no cluster description.)

    Some additional modifications were made to account for errors in the
    Olson time zone files.

    Cluster names were made on a best-efforts basis by the author. If you
    have suggested improvements, please file a bug report with your ideas.

    The clustering will be updated over time as the Olson time zone database
    changes.

FUNCTIONS
  primary_zones
        my $zones = primary_zones('US');

    Takes a country code and returns a reference to an array of hash
    references. Each element in the array represents one timezone cluster in
    the country, sorted by UTC offset. The hash reference contains the
    following keys:

    *   description: Description of the zone or the Olson country name if
        there is only one cluster

    *   offset: UTC offset, expressed in hours ('+5', '-2')

    *   timezone_name: the primary Olson zone name for the cluster
        ('America/Chicago')

    For example, here are some of the items returned from
    "primary_zones('AQ')":

        [
            {
                'description'   => 'Palmer Station, Anvers Island',
                'offset'        => -4,
                'timezone_name' => 'Antarctica/Palmer'
            },
            {
                'description'   => 'Rothera Station, Adelaide Island',
                'offset'        => -3,
                'timezone_name' => 'Antarctica/Rothera'
            },
            ...
        ]

    The description may be the Olson description of the primary zone or it
    may be a custom alternative that the author feels best describes the
    cluster.

    Offsets given are the smallest offset observed during the year. This
    should correspond to the non-daylight savings time offset in zones that
    observe daylight savings time for part of the year.

    The primary zone is the best guess at the most common or recognizable
    Olson name in the cluster; see the "DESCRIPTION" section for details.

    If an invalid country code is given, the function returns an empty array
    reference.

  find_primary
        my $primary = find_primary("America/Indiana/Indianapolis");
        # returns "America/New_York"

    Given an Olson time zone name, returns the primary zone name for the
    cluster containing the zone. Returns undef or the empty list if the zone
    is not recognized.

  is_primary
        if ( is_primary("America/Chicago") ) { ... }

    A boolean function to check if a time zone is primary for its cluster.

  country_codes
        for my $cc ( country_codes() ) {
            ...
        }

    Returns a sorted list of known country codes in the cluster database.

  country_name
        my $name = country_name("US");

    Returns the Olson country name (or an empty string) for a given country
    code. This duplicates information available elsewhere and is provided
    here for convenience.

  timezone_clusters
        for my $cluster ( @{ timezone_clusters('US') } ) {
            ...
        }

    Given a country code, returns an array reference of raw cluster data for
    the country (or an empty array reference if the country code is not
    found).

    Each cluster is a hash reference with "description" and "zones". The
    "zones" entry is an array reference of time zone hashes similar to that
    returned by "primary_zones", but with "olson_description" containing the
    the original Olson description rather than "description" for the
    cluster. Note that for single-cluster countries, the cluster description
    will be blank.

    For example, "timezone_clusters("US")" will return a data structure like
    this:

        [
            {
                'description' => 'Hawaii',
                'zones'       => [
                    {
                        'offset'            => -10,
                        'olson_description' => 'Hawaii',
                        'timezone_name'     => 'Pacific/Honolulu'
                    }
                ]
            },
            {
                'description' => 'Aleutian Islands',
                'zones'       => [
                    {
                        'offset'            => -10,
                        'olson_description' => 'Aleutian Islands',
                        'timezone_name'     => 'America/Adak'
                    }
                ]
            },
            {
                'description' => 'Alaska Time',
                'zones'       => [
                    {
                        'offset'            => '-9',
                        'olson_description' => 'Alaska Time',
                        'timezone_name'     => 'America/Anchorage'
                    },
                    {
                        'offset'            => -9,
                        'olson_description' => 'Alaska Time - west Alaska',
                        'timezone_name'     => 'America/Nome'
                    },
                    {
                        'offset'            => '-9',
                        'olson_description' => 'Alaska Time - Alaska panhandle',
                        'timezone_name'     => 'America/Juneau'
                    },
                    {
                        'offset'            => '-9',
                        'olson_description' => 'Alaska Time - Alaska panhandle neck',
                        'timezone_name'     => 'America/Yakutat'
                    },
                    {
                        'offset'            => '-9',
                        'olson_description' => 'Alaska Time - southeast Alaska panhandle',
                        'timezone_name'     => 'America/Sitka'
                    },
                ]
            },
            ...
        ]

  find_cluster
        my $cluster = find_cluster("America/Indiana/Indianapolis");

    Given an Olson time zone name, returns the cluster data structure
    containing the time zone. It returns undef or the empty list if the time
    zone name is not recognized.
