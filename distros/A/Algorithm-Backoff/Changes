	- Add strategies: LILD, LIMD, MILD, MIMD.

        - Make max_delay and min_delay a common attribute for all strategies.

	- [bugfix] jittered delay shouldn't have violated min_delay and
          max_delay.

	- [refactor] Refactor to reduce code duplication.

	- [doc] Show illustrations using show-backoff-delays CLI in
	  Synopsis.

	- [meta] No longer mark delay_on_success as common attribute, because we
	  now have algorithms that have varying delays on success.
