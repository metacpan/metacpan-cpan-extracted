HTTP/Parser
===========

HTTP::Parser is a stateful HTTP request/response parsing module.

It accepts chunks of data passed to it and returns either a completion hint
or an HTTP::Request (or Response) object when it has the entire request.  It
was originally written to be part of a simple Event.pm-based HTTP server.

e.g.

 use HTTP::Parser;

 my $parser = HTTP::Parser->new();
 my @lines = ('GET / HTTP/1.1','Host: localhost','Connection: close','','');

 my $result;
 foreach my $line (@lines) {
   $result = $parser->add("$line\x0d\x0a");
   print "passing '$line' got '$result'\n";
 }
 print $parser->object->as_string();


gives:

 GET /
 Connection: close
 Host: localhost
 X-HTTP-Version: 1.1
