NAME
    match::simple - simplified clone of smartmatch operator

SYNOPSIS
       use v5.10;
       use match::simple;
   
       if ($this |M| $that)
       {
          say "$this matches $that";
       }

DESCRIPTION
    match::simple provides a simple match operator `|M|` that acts like a sane
    subset of the (as of Perl 5.18) deprecated smart match operator. Unlike
    smart match, the behaviour of the match is determined entirely by the
    operand on the right hand side.

    *   If the right hand side is `undef`, then there is only a match if the
        left hand side is also `undef`.

    *   If the right hand side is a non-reference, then the match is a simple
        string match.

    *   If the right hand side is a reference to a regexp, then the left hand
        is evaluated .

    *   If the right hand side is a code reference, then it is called in a
        boolean context with the left hand side being passed as an argument.

    *   If the right hand side is an object which provides a `MATCH` method,
        then it this is called as a method, with the left hand side being
        passed as an argument.

    *   If the right hand side is an object which overloads `~~`, then a true
        smart match is performed.

    *   If the right hand side is an arrayref, then the operator recurses into
        the array, with the match succeeding if the left hand side matches any
        array element.

    *   If any other value appears on the right hand side, the operator will
        croak.

    If you don't like the crazy Sub::Infix operator, you can alternatively
    export a more normal function:

       use v5.10;
       use match::simple qw(match);
   
       if (match($this, $that))
       {
          say "$this matches $that";
       }

    If you're making heavy use of this module, then this is probably your best
    option, as it runs significantly faster.

  XS Backend
    If you install match::simple::XS, a faster XS-based implementation will be
    used instead of the pure Perl functions. Depending on what sort of match
    you are doing, this is likely to be several times faster. In extreme
    cases, such as matching a string in an arrayref, it can be twenty-five
    times faster, or more. However, where $that is a single regexp, it's
    around 30% slower. Overall though, I think the performance improvement is
    worthwhile.

    If you want to take advantage of this speed up, use the `match` function
    rather than the `|M|` operator. Otherwise all your gains will be lost to
    the slow implementation of operator overloading.

    The constant `match::simple::IMPLEMENTATION` tells you which backend is
    currently in use.

  Environment
    Setting the `MATCH_SIMPLE_IMPLEMENTATION` environment variable to "PP"
    encourages match::simple to use the pure Perl backend.
