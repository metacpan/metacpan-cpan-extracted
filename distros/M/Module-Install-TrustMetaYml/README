NAME
    Module::Install::TrustMetaYml - trusts META.yml list of dependencies

SYNOPSIS
    In Makefile.PL:

            trust_meta_yml;

DESCRIPTION
    CPAN doesn't trust "META.yml"'s list of dependencies for a module.
    Instead it expects "Makefile.PL" run on the computer the package is
    being installed upon to generate its own list of dependencies (called
    "MYMETA.yml" or "MYMETA.json").

    This module is a Module::Install plugin that generates "MYMETA.yml" by
    simply passing through the dependencies from "META.yml".

    It does nothing when run from the module author's development copy.

    The module defines two functions which are aliases for each other:

    "trust_meta_yml"
    "trust_meta_yaml"
