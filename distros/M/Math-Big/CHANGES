1.15 2021-07-13

 * This release does not add any new functionality. It is just to try to keep
   the distribution up to date with the Perl environment.

 * Make to_base() a front-end to Math::BigInt->to_base().

 * Add to_base() to the list of exported functions.

 * Make fibonacci() a front-end to Math::BigInt->bfac().

 * Reorganize existing test files, and add more test files.

 * Better Makefile.PL.

 * The tests now require Test::More version 0.88 or newer.

 * New MANIFEST.SKIP file based on the template in the ExtUtils-Manifest
   distribution.

 * Format CHANGES according to CPAN::Changes::Spec.

1.14 2016-12-03 pjacklam

 * Remove BENCHMARK file. The information there was obsolete.

 * Remove INSTALL file. The information is in the README file.

 * Use ExtUtils::MakeMaker rather than Module::Install in Makefile.PL.

 * Explicitly set required version of Math::BigInt in Math/Big.pm.

 * Trim whitespace.

 * Remove author information in LICENSE file.

 * Update README file.

 * Inform that the TODO file is not up to date.

1.13 2016-04-26 pjacklam

 * Replace "use vars ..." with "our ...".

 * Fix documentation error in Math::Big. (CPAN RT #60614)

 * Add patch to speed up primes(). (CPAN RT #81986)

 * Fix documentation error in Math::Big::Factors. (CPAN RT #100917)

 * Use OO-style calls, e.g., Math::BigInt->bzero(), not Math::BigInt::bzero().
   (CPAN RT #113959)

 * Use "=pod" to start POD section.

 * In the POD, replace "METHODS" header with "FUNCTIONS". OO-style calls are
   not supported, so they are functions, not methods.

 * In the POD, use "=item" for each function, not "=head2".

 * Code reformatting.

 * Remove trailing whitespace.

 * Remove unnecessary "1;" at end of file.

 * Add "use warnings" to all modules.

 * In Makefile.PL, add "#!perl" to the top, as it gives nice syntax
   highlighting in some editors.

 * In Makefile.PL, update author information.

 * In Makefile.PL, change required version of Math::BigInt to 1.82 (which
   shipped with Math::BigFloat 1.54). This is the oldest version of
   Math::BigInt (and Math::BigFloat) that work with this distribution.

 * In Makefile.PL, change "build_requires 'Test::More' => 0.42" to
   "test_requires 'Test::More' => 0.47". Test::More is only needed for testing,
   not building, and version 0.47 is the required version.

 * In Makefile.PL, change "require 5.6.2" to "require 5.006001". Math::BigInt
   requires only Perl v5.6.1, not v5.6.2.

 * Edit the "BUGS" file so it points to "rt.cpan.org".

 * Edit the "NEW" file so it points to the "CHANGES" file.

 * Remove stuff from POD that is covered in the more complete "CREDITS" file.

 * Update the bundled version of Module::Install from v0.65 to v1.16.

 * Add more entries to "MANIFEST.SKIP".

1.12 2007-04-17 Tels 182 tests

 * speed up fibonacci():
   + by not making the argument a BigInt
   + caching a few more numbers
   + removing a few needless scalar computations

 * fix bug in fibonacci() missing a few intermidiate results

 * euler() just uses BigInt's fast bexp() method and is thus now MUHC faster

 * require Math::BigInt v1.83 (and thus Perl v5.6.2)

 * bundle and use Module::Install

##############################################################################

1.11 2005-01-02 Tels 177 tests

 * streamlined euler()

 * @k = hailstone() is about 3..4 times faster

 * $k = scalar hailstone() is about 6..7 times faster

 * primes() is about 1.5 times faster

 * fix documentation for primes() (Thanx Es Allen Smith!)

 * add to_base($n, $base, [$alphabet]) (Thanx Tilghman Lesher!)

1.10 2004-08-13 Tels 161 tests

 * __END__ in Big.pm, remove shebang line

 * removed needless return statements for more speed

 * log() now simple calls BigFloat log for speed (it was unusable slow before)

 * hailstone() is between two and three times faster

 * pi() is slightly faster by caching two objects for '5' and '236'

 * require Math::BigInt v1.72

 * arctan(), tan(), sin(), cos() etc are now about 10% faster

 * arcsin($x) were $x != 0 was broken
