1.08    Version released at 2008-09-20-14:22.

1.07_05 Version released at 2008-09-15-14:34.  *** Development version. ***
        Version started at  2008-09-15-14:24.
        31-size-hack-force-missing-devel-size.t:
          1.07_04 changes didn't fix taint issue either.
          Reverted to using tempdir()'s CLEANUP option since rmtree() still
          died under -T for 5.6.2 perls.
          Removed -T flag, I give up trying to get it working for this test. :)

1.07_04 Version started at  2008-09-09-17:20.  *** Development version. ***
        31-size-hack-force-missing-devel-size.t:
          1.07_03 changes didn't fix taint issue.
          Do own tempdir cleanup rather than rely on File::Temp's cleanup
          that appears to trigger tainted chmod in perl 5.6.2's File::Path
          rmtree().
          Use a template for tempdir name that makes it clear that
          Cache::CacheFactory is the culprit if it fails to be cleaned up.
        Version released at 2008-09-09-18:46.

1.07_03 Version released at 2008-09-05-21:45.  *** Development version. ***
        Version started at  2008-09-05-20:32.
        31-size-hack-force-missing-devel-size.t:
          Trimmed PERL5OPT trickery it was extra cut-n-paste code that
          wasn't needed and possibly triggered taint issues.

1.07_02 Version started at  2008-09-01-19:17.  *** Development version. ***
        20-storage.t namespace check no longer breaks on systems that
        already have existing namespaces for persistent cache storage policies.
        Ensured there's a #!perl and use warnings/strict in each test.
        Version released at 2008-09-02-09:13.
