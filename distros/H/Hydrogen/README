NAME
    Hydrogen - utilities for the simplest elements of Perl

SYNOPSIS
    Normal version of the function:

        use feature 'say';
        use Hydrogen::HashRef { prefix => 'hhr_' }, qw( get set );
    
        my %hash;
        hhr_set( \%hash, Alice => 123 );
        hhr_set( \%hash, Bob   => 456 );
    
        say $hash{Alice};                ## ==> 123
        say hhr_get( \%hash, 'Bob' );    ## ==> 456

    Version of the function which uses prototypes:

        use feature 'say';
        use Hydrogen::Hash { prefix => 'hh_' }, qw( get set );
    
        my %hash;
        hh_set( %hash, Alice => 123 );
        hh_set( %hash, Bob   => 456 );
    
        say $hash{Alice};                ## ==> 123
        say hh_get( %hash, 'Bob' );      ## ==> 456

    Currying:

        use feature 'say';
        use Hydrogen::Curry::HashRef qw( curry_get curry_set );
    
        my %hash;
        my $setter = curry_set( \%hash );
        my $getter = curry_get( \%hash );
    
        $setter->( Alice => 123 );
        $setter->( Bob   => 456 );
    
        say $hash{Alice};                ## ==> 123
        say $getter->( 'Bob' );          ## ==> 456

    Using the $_ topic variable:

        use feature 'say';
        use Hydrogen::Topic::HashRef qw( get set );
    
        local $_ = {};
    
        set( Alice => 123 );
        set( Bob   => 456 );
    
        say $_->{Alice};                 ## ==> 123
        say get( 'Bob' );                ## ==> 456

DESCRIPTION
    Hydrogen provides a standard library for doing really simple things in
    Perl. And I mean *really* simple things.

    Things which are often Perl builtin functions, operators, and even just
    part of Perl syntax like accessing keys within hashes.

RATIONALE
    Whydrogen?

    You can make a coderef pointing to `\&Hydrogen::Number::add` but you can't
    make a coderef pointing to Perl's `+=` operator!

    If you are implementing a scripting language or DSL which needs to provide
    a standard library of builtin functions, then Hydrogen may be a good place
    to start.

BONUS FUNCTIONS
    Hydrogen uses the following functions internally, but they may also be
    useful to you.

  `Hydrogen::croak( $message, @args? )`
    Acts like `croak` from Carp, but if @args is provided, will `sprintf`
    first. If @args contains references, those will be dumped using
    Data::Dumper.

  `Hydrogen::fc( $string? )`
    Acts like `CORE::fc` if that function is available, and `CORE::lc`
    otherwise.

    If no $string is provided, operates on $_.

DEPENDENCIES
    Hydrogen requires Perl 5.8.1 or above.

    Hydrogen requires the modules Carp, Data::Dumper, List::Util, and
    Scalar::Util, all of which normally come with Perl. Hydrogen needs at
    least version 1.54 of List::Util; Perl versions older than 5.32.0 will be
    distributed with older versions of List::Util, but upgrades to the module
    can be found on the CPAN.

    Hydrogen also requires the module Exporter::Shiny which can be found on
    the CPAN.

    Hydrogen's test suite requires the module Test2::V0 which can be found on
    the CPAN.

SEE ALSO
    This standard library is autogenerated from Sub::HandlesVia which provides
    the same functionality as methods which objects can delegate to
    attributes.
