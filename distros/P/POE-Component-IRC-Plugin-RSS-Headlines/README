DESCRIPTION

    plugin that provides a mechanism for retrieving RSS headlines from
    given URLs.

        'http_alias', you may provide the alias of an existing POE::Component::Client::HTTP 
                      component that the plugin will use instead of spawning it's own;
        'follow_redirects', this argument is passed to PoCoCl::HTTP to inform it how to deal with
                      following redirects, default is 2;

INPUT EVENTS

    The plugin registers the following state handler within your session:

    get_headline

      Takes a hashref as an argument with the following keys:

        'url', the RSS based url to retrieve items for;

      You may pass arbitary key/value pairs, but the keys must be prefixed
      with an underscore.

OUTPUT

    The following irc event is generated with the result of a
    'get_headline' command:

    irc_rssheadlines_items

      Has the following parameters:

        'ARG0', the original hashref that was passed;
        'ARG1' .. $#_, RSS headline item titles;
