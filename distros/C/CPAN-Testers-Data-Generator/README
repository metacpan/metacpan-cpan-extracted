AUTHOR
  It should be noted that the original code for this distribution began
  life under another name. The original distribution generated data for
  the original CPAN Testers website. However, in 2008 the code was
  reworked to generate data in the format for the statistics data
  analysis, which in turn was reworked to drive the redesign of the all
  the CPAN Testers websites. To reflect the code changes, a new name was
  given to the distribution.
