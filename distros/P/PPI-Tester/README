NAME
    PPI::Tester - A wxPerl-based interactive PPI debugger/tester

DESCRIPTION
    This package implements a wxWindows desktop application which provides
    the ability to interactively test the PPI perl parser.

    The "PPI::Tester" module implements the application, but is itself of no
    use to the user. The launcher for the application 'ppitester' is
    installed with this module, and can be launched by simply typing the
    following from the command line.

      ppitester

    When launched, the application consists of two vertical panels. The left
    panel is where you should type in your code sample. As the left hand
    panel is changed, a PPI::Dumper output is continuously updated in the
    right hand panel.

    There is a toolbar at the top of the application with two icon buttons,
    currently without icons. The first toolbar button clears the panels, the
    second is a placeholder for loading in code from a file, and is not yet
    implemented. ( It's early days yet for this application ).

TO DO
    - There are no icons on the toolbar buttons

    - An option is needed to save both the left and right panels into a
    matching pair of files, compatible with the lexer testing script.
