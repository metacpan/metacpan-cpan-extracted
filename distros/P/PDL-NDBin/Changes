Revision history for PDL::NDBin

0.025     2022-02-08 04:41:24+00:00 Europe/London

 - change [t] params to [o] as wanted results back - PDL 2.073 forbids passing

0.024     2022-02-04 07:07:04+00:00 Europe/London

 - switch barf() to $CROAK() in case that is what caused smoker SEGV

0.023     2022-02-02 02:26:30+00:00 Europe/London

 - allow for PDL 2.056 aggregate functions returning ndarray not Perl value
 - opt in to PDL 2.058 multi-C for faster builds

0.021 2021-04-17

 - updated to work with PDL 2.037

0.020     2020-04-01 14:11:44+02:00 Europe/Brussels

 - fixed the test suite breaking on some, but not all, versions of PDL, due to
   PDL::Lite not exporting pdl() (Edward Baudrez)

0.019     2020-03-26 10:19:45+01:00 Europe/Brussels

 - fixed the test suite breaking because recent versions of PDL::Lite no longer
   export sequence() (RT #131753) (GitHub issue #2:
   https://github.com/ebaudrez/PDL-NDBin/issues/2). Reported by Slaven Rezić
   and Rebecca Loiselle (thank you!).

0.018     2015-09-15 15:50:41+02:00 Europe/Brussels

 - the PDL function propogate_badflag() has been renamed to propagate_badflag()
   somewhere between 2.007 and 2.008, and PDL::NDBin has been adapted to work
   with both pre-2.008 and post-2.008 PDLs. Reported by Slaven Rezić, practical
   fix by Bryan Jurish (thank you!)

0.017     2015-04-01 13:43:19CEST+0200 Europe/Brussels

 - add support for variable-width bins (Diab Jerius)

0.016     2014-11-17 11:13:39CET+0100 Europe/Brussels

 - worked around a warning message emitted by the latest Perl development
   releases (RT #100228). Reported by Slaven Rezić (thank you!). (Edward
   Baudrez)

0.015     2013-12-11 11:56:13 Europe/Brussels

 - added PDL::Core::Dev to configure_requires (RT #91304) (Edward Baudrez)

0.014     2013-12-10 14:24:54 Europe/Brussels

 - tests started failing with recent development versions of PDL (2.007_01 or
   2.007_02, not sure). Fixed now. (Edward Baudrez)

0.013     2013-12-06 09:01:39 Europe/Brussels

 - added 64-bit support. PDL::NDBin will take advantage of 64-bit support with
   recent versions of PDL (2.007 or later), but should work with earlier
   versions, as well. Note that 64-bit support has not been tested very well
   yet, so it qualifies as 64-bit "safe" until I find time for more testing.
   But PDL::NDBin should now at least install on PDL 2.007 or later. (Edward
   Baudrez)

0.012     2013-07-02 11:13:46 Europe/Brussels

 - fixed the tests to work with the latest development release of PDL
   (2.006_03) (Edward Baudrez)

0.011     2013-03-15 09:55:16 Europe/Brussels

 - try to avoid test failures with old versions of Module::Pluggable (Edward
   Baudrez)
 - changed the syntax to specify the type of the output piddle in the action
   class constructors. Previously, this was achieved by passing a coderef:
      PDL::NDBin::Action::Avg->new( ..., type => \&PDL::double );
   This has now changed to
      type => double         # or 'type => PDL::double'
   The new syntax is simpler and arguably clearer. (Edward Baudrez)
 - implemented the action classes PDL::NDBin::Action::Min and
   PDL::NDBin::Action::Max (Edward Baudrez)
 - various minor fixes (Edward Baudrez)

0.010     2013-03-07 11:09:22 Europe/Brussels

 - release on master branch instead of development branch; no changes

0.009     2013-03-07 11:01:19 Europe/Brussels

 - it is now possible to pass additional arguments to action class constructors
   when specifying actions; the only additional argument so far is the type of
   the output piddle, allowing you to write, e.g.,
      my $binner = PDL::NDBin->new(
         axes => ...,
         vars => [ [ var => { class => 'StdDev', type => \&PDL::float } ] ],
      );
   to get the standard deviation in type 'float' instead of the default type
   'double' (Edward Baudrez)
 - try to make the tests run under Perl 5.8 (Edward Baudrez)
 - other minor fixes (Edward Baudrez)

0.008     2013-02-12 17:29:45 Europe/Brussels

 - implemented the advance() method of PDL::NDBin::Iterator in XS. This
   improves the performance of PDL::NDBin for very large bin numbers greatly,
   and also reduces the overhead (for very small datafiles) somewhat. The user
   manual has been updated with the latest results. (Edward Baudrez)
 - fixed a test that started failing with the latest PDL development releases
   (Edward Baudrez)

0.007     2013-02-05 23:42:23 Europe/Brussels

 - simplified and optimized PDL::NDBin::Iterator somewhat, in an attempt to
   address the poor performance with large numbers of bins (Edward Baudrez)
 - added more tests in an attempt to catch a strange test failure that I cannot
   reproduce (Edward Baudrez)

0.006     2013-02-03 22:06:31 Europe/Brussels

 - first public release

0.005     2013-02-03 21:12:45 Europe/Brussels

 - never released on CPAN
 - started using Dist::Zilla for distribution management (Edward Baudrez)
 - added documentation for PDL::NDBin::Iterator and other classes (Edward
   Baudrez)

0.004 2013-02-02

 - never released on CPAN

 [API change: preferred interface]
 - the object-oriented interface is now the preferred interface (Edward Baudrez)
 - require the axis specifications in new() to be given as key => value pairs
   (Edward Baudrez)
 - make_labels() has been removed; you should use the method labels() now; call
   as follows:
      my $binner = PDL::NDBin->new( axes => [ [ 'x', ... ] ] );
      $binner->feed( x => $x );
      my @labels = $binner->labels;
   The required data can also be fed directly to labels() if desired:
      my @labels = $binner->labels( x => $x );
   (Edward Baudrez)
 - process_axes() has been removed; you should use autoscale() now (see below)
   (Edward Baudrez)
 - support for DEFAULT_ACTION has been dropped; it is now required to specify
   an action for every variable (Edward Baudrez)
 - variables no longer assume a default action when none is supplied; it is now
   required to state the action explicitly for every variable. To continue to
   use the default action of producing a histogram, use the following:
      ndbin( ..., vars => [ $x, 'Count' ] );
   (Edward Baudrez)

 [New features]
 - in addition to 'step', 'min', and 'n', new() now also accepts 'max' and
   'round' in axis specifications (Edward Baudrez)
 - added a method feed() to feed data piecewise (or all at once) before calling
   process(); this can be very useful when data is being read from a file. It
   essentially separates the data feeding from the processing step (both were
   done at the same time before, in the call to process()). This also means you
   can now call process() without arguments, provided that you have already fed
   all required data before. (Edward Baudrez)
 - added a method autoscale() to have missing axis specifications derived
   automatically from the data. As a side effect, it is now allowed to call the
   constructor with too few or even without any axis specifications:
      my $binner = PDL::NDBin->new( axes => [ [ x => ( n => 10 ) ],
                                              [ 'y' ] ] );
      $binner->process( x => $x, y => $y );
   This used to raise an error in previous versions. (Edward Baudrez)

 [Other improvements]
 - also greatly expanded the manual, test suite, and benchmark (Edward Baudrez)
 - fixed a few bugs (Edward Baudrez)

0.003 2012-08-10

 - never released on CPAN
 - PDL::NDBin now supports concatenation of calls: very useful to process
   multiple input files. You need use the object-oriented interface to do this.
   (Edward Baudrez)
 - API change for action coderefs: the first (and only) argument is now an
   iterator instead of a piddle containing the selected data. This means that
   where coderefs looked like this in the previous version:
      sub { my $pdl = shift; return $pdl->avg }
   you now have to write:
      sub { my $iter = shift; return $iter->selection->avg }
   (Edward Baudrez)
 - exceptions in actions are no longer caught. This change requires the user to
   protect from potentially dangerous code with an 'eval' block. (Edward
   Baudrez)
 - in addition to coderefs, now also accepts action class names (Edward
   Baudrez)
 - continued the object-oriented refactoring (Edward Baudrez)
 - greatly expanded the test suite (Edward Baudrez)

0.002 2012-07-11

 - never released on CPAN
 - now using Log::Any for logging (Edward Baudrez)
 - started refactoring by moving to object-oriented core implementation, with
   wrapper functions. This change is not yet visible at the user level, but
   will become so in the next version. (Edward Baudrez)

0.001 2012-06-28

 - never released on CPAN
 - imported the code in a Git repository (Edward Baudrez)
