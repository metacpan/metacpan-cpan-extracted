README for CPAN distribution Perl-RT2Github

Issue tracking for the Perl 5 core distribution has been moved from
rt.perl.org to Github issues.

The functionality in this distribution will enable you to provide a list of
one or more RT ID numbers and get back the corresponding Github issue IDs or
URLs.

Pre-requisites:
Configuration:  Devel::CheckBin (CPAN)
Runtime:        HTTP::Tiny (shipped with Perl 5 core distribution 5.14+)
Testing:        Test::RequiresInternet (CPAN)

At the very least you should be able to use this set of instructions
to install the module...

perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install

If you are on a windows box you should use 'nmake' rather than 'make'.
