NAME
    Catalyst::ActionRole::DetachOnDie - If something dies in a chain, stop
    the chain. DEPRECATED IN FAVOR OF CATALYST 5.90040

VERSION
    version 0.001006

SYNOPSIS
     package MyApp::Controller::Foo;
     use Moose;

     BEGIN { extends 'Catalyst::Controller::ActionRole' }

     __PACKAGE__->config(
        action => {
           '*' => { Does => 'DetachOnDie' },
        },
     );

     ...;

DESCRIPTION
    Chained dispatch is arguably one of the coolest features Catalyst has to
    offer, unfortunately it is marred by the bizarre decision to have
    exceptions thrown not detach a chain. To be clear, if one has a chain as
    follows:

     sub first  : Chained('/') PathPart('') CaptureArgs(0) { ... }
     sub middle : Chained('first') PathPart('middle') CaptureArgs(0) { ... }
     sub last   : Chained('middle') PathPart('') Args(0) { ... }

    If the URL /middle is dispatched to, but an exception is raised in the
    "middle" (or even "first") method, the "last" method will still run!
    This module solves that problem. I recommend you use it as I have
    documented in the "SYNOPSIS", as that will make it apply to all of your
    actions, but if for some reason you do not want to apply it to all
    actions you can apply it per action as follows:

     sub foo : Chained('bar') PathPart('') CaptureArgs(0) Does('DetachOnDie') { ... }

    If you do not want to use the action role, check out
    Catalyst::Action::DetachOnDie, which does the same thing but does not
    require the use of Catalyst::Controller::ActionRole.

DEPRECATED
    Instead of using this module you should use Catalyst 5.90040 and set the
    "abort_chain_on_error_fix" flag.
