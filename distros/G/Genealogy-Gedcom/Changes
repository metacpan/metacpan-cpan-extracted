0.88  2016-08-14T11:33:00

		See RT#116939. Thanx to Chad Granum.

0.87  Sat Nov 14 16:31:00 2015
	- Parse http://www.tamurajones.net/GEDCOMANSELTable.xhtml and extract all the special characters
		called ANSEL. See FAQ for details. This is a demonstration of how this code handles UTF-8.
	- Add scripts/parse.sample.7.pl, data/GEDCOMANSELTable.xhtml (UTF-8) and
		data/sample.7.ged (UTF-8).

0.86  Sat Nov 14 10:44:00 2015
	- Remove redundant program scripts/read.pl.
	- Fix dates in data/sample.[1234].ged which used 10-08-2011 instead of 10 Aug 2011.
	- Remove Build.PL.
	- Remove all references to DateTime.
	- Remove locale().
	- Upgrade to Genealogy::Gedcom::Date V 2.01 (which handles Unicode).
	- Switch from Hash::FieldHash to Moo.
	- Switch from Perl6::Slurp to File::Slurper.
	- Switch from Test::More to Test::Stream.
	- Move t/pod.t into xt/author/.
	- Add scripts/test.all.dates.pl, which parses all date records in data/*.ged, using the newly
		re-written Genealogy::Gedcom::Date.
	- Add scripts/pod2html.sh.
	- Create repo at https://github.com/ronsavage/Genealogy-Gedcom.
		This includes updating the docs and Makefile.PL.
	- Update the docs generally.

0.85  Thu Sep 26 09:12:00 2013
	- Fix typo in docs which referred to Tamura Jones as female. My apologies to him.

0.84  Fri Jun 28 11:51:00 2013
	- Add data/sample.6.ged to match data/sample.5.ged, to cover the 2 types of dates within the header.
		One case (sample.5.ged) is used where a TIME is allowed, and the other where it is not.
	- Active the debug flag in t/date.t to try exposing test failures for '15 Jul 1954'.

0.83  Wed Jun 26 10:56:00 2013
	- Rename CHANGES to Changes as per CPAN::Changes::SPEC.
	- Remove the HTML templates called rainbow*, because they were never used.
	- Update pre-preqs' version #s, especially for DateTime and DateTime::Infinite, to see if that fixes
		mysterious CPAN Tester failures with t/date.t's use of '15 Jul 1954'.
		Also, we now require Genealogy::Gedcom::Date V 1.08, which has the same DateTime pre-reqs.

0.82  Mon Feb 27 13:33:00 2012
	- The switch in V 0.81 from DateTime::Format::Gedcom to Genealogy::Gedcom::Date omitted some edits in t/*.t.

0.81  Thu Sep 29 14:48:00 2011
	- Switch pre-req from DateTime::Format::Gedcom V 1.01 to Genealogy::Gedcom::Date V 1.00.
	- Update UUID proposal with use case.
	- Rename UUID proposal from docs/uuid.txt to docs/uuid.proposal.pod, and add docs/uuid.proposal.html.
	- Remove obsolete docs/rationale.*.
	- In the array of hashrefs recording lex results, the type field can now be 'Date' or 'Invalid date'.
		'Date' means it was successfully parsed, and 'Invalid date' means it could not be parsed.

0.80  Mon Aug 29 12:00:00 2011
	- Initial release.
