NAME
    Tie::Moose - tie a hash to a Moose object (yeah, like Tie::MooseObject)

SYNOPSIS
            use v5.14;
        
            package Person {
                    use Moose;
                    has name => (
                            is     => "rw",
                            isa    => "Str",
                    );
                    has age => (
                            is     => "rw",
                            isa    => "Num",
                            reader => "get_age",
                            writer => "set_age",
                    );
            }
        
            my $bob = Person->new(name => "Robert");
        
            tie my %bob, "Tie::Moose", $bob;
        
            $bob{age} = 32;       # calls the "set_age" method
            $bob{age} = "x";      # would croak
            $bob{xyz} = "x";      # would croak

DESCRIPTION
    This module is much like Tie::MooseObject. It ties a hash to an instance
    of a Moose-based class, allowing you to access attributes as hash keys. It
    uses the accessors provided by Moose, and thus honours read-only
    attributes, type constraints and coercions, triggers, etc.

    There are a few key differences with Tie::MooseObject:

    *   It handles differently named getters/setters more to my liking. Given
        the example in the SYNOPSIS, with Tie::MooseObject you need to write:

                $bob{set_age} = 32;
                say $bob{get_age};

        Whereas with Tie::Moose, you just use the `age` hash key for both
        fetching from and storing to the hash.

    *   Implements `DELETE` from the Tie::Hash interface. Tie::MooseObject
        does not allow keys to be deleted from its hashes.

        (`DELETE` only works on Moose attributes that have a "clearer"
        method.)

    *   Supplied with various traits to influence the behaviour of the tied
        hash.

                tie my %bob, "Tie::Moose"->with_traits("ReadOnly"), $bob;

        (Note that by design, many of the traits supplied with Tie::Moose are
        mutually exclusive.)
