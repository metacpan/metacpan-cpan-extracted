=head1 NAME

XML::Compile::SOAP::Server - server-side SOAP message processing

=head1 INHERITANCE

 XML::Compile::SOAP::Server is extended by
   XML::Compile::SOAP11::Server
   XML::Compile::SOAP12::Server

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  # used by distribution XML::Compile::SOAP::Daemon

  my $soap   = XML::Compile::SOAP11::Server->new;
  my $input  = $soap->compileMessage('RECEIVER', ...);
  my $output = $soap->compileMessage('SENDER', ...);

  $soap->compileHandler
    ( name => $name, input => $input, output => $output
    , callback => \$my_handler
    );

  my $daemon = XML::Compile::SOAP::HTTPDaemon->new(...);
  $daemon->addHandler($type => $daemon);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class defines methods that each server for the SOAP
message exchange protocols must implement.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 Instantiation

This object can not be instantiated, but is only used as secundary
base class.  The primary must contain the C<new>.

=over 4

=item XML::Compile::SOAP::Server-E<gt>B<new>(%options)

 -Option--Default
  role    'NEXT'

=over 2

=item role => URI

In SOAP1.1, the term is 'actor', but SOAP1.2 has renamed this into
'role': the role [this daemon] plays in the transport protocol.

Please use the role abbreviations as provided by the protocol
implementations when possible: they will be translated into the
right URI on time.  See L<XML::Compile::SOAP::roleAbbreviation()|XML::Compile::SOAP/"Transcoding">
and the constants defined in L<XML::Compile::SOAP::Util|XML::Compile::SOAP::Util>

=back

=back

=head2 Accessors

=over 4

=item $obj-E<gt>B<role>()

Returns the URI of the role (actor) of this server.

=back

=head2 Actions

=over 4

=item $obj-E<gt>B<compileFilter>(%options)

This routine returns a CODE reference which can be used for
L<compileHandler(selector)|XML::Compile::SOAP::Server/"Actions">; so see whether a certain message has arrived.
On the moment, only the first C<body> element is used to determine that.

 -Option--Default
  body    []
  fault   <undef>
  header  <undef>

=over 2

=item body => ARRAY-of-TYPES

=item fault => ARRAY-of-TYPES

=item header => ARRAY-of-TYPES

=back

=item $obj-E<gt>B<compileHandler>(%options)

Returns an HTTP status code and an XML::LibXML::Document pair.

 -Option  --Default
  callback  <fault: not implemented>
  decode    <undef>
  encode    <undef>
  name      <required>
  selector  sub {0}

=over 2

=item callback => CODE

As input, the SERVER object and the translated input message (Perl version)
are passed in.  As output, a suitable output structure must be produced.
If the callback is not set, then a fault message will be returned to the
user.

=item decode => CODE

The CODE reference is used to decode the (parsed) XML input message
into the pure Perl request.  The reference is a READER, created with
L<XML::Compile::Schema::compile()|XML::Compile::Schema/"Compilers">.  If no input decoder is specified,
then the callback handler will be called with the un-decoded
XML::LibXML::Document node.

=item encode => CODE

The CODE reference is used to encode the Perl answer structure into the
output message.  The reference is a WRITER.  created with
L<XML::Compile::Schema::compile()|XML::Compile::Schema/"Compilers">.  If no output encoder is specified,
then the callback must return an XML::LibXML::Document, or only
produce error messages.

=item name => STRING

The identification for this action, for instance used for logging.  When
the action is created via a WSDL, the portname will be used here.

It is a pity that the portname is not passed in the SOAP message,
because it is not so easy to detect which handler must be called.

=item selector => CODE

One way or the other, you have to figure-out whether a message addresses
a certain process. The callback will only be used if the CODE reference
specified here returns a true value.

The CODE reference will be called with the XML version of the message,
and a HASH which contains the information about the XML collected with
L<XML::Compile::SOAP::messageStructure()|XML::Compile::SOAP/"Single message"> plus the C<soap_version> entry.

=back

=item XML::Compile::SOAP::Server-E<gt>B<faultWriter>()

Returns a CODE reference which can be used to produce faults.
