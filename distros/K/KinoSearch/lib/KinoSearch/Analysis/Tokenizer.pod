=head1 NAME

KinoSearch::Analysis::Tokenizer - Split a string into tokens.

=head1 DEPRECATED

The KinoSearch code base has been assimilated by the Apache L<Lucy> project.
The "KinoSearch" namespace has been deprecated, but development continues
under our new name at our new home: L<http://lucy.apache.org/>

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $whitespace_tokenizer
        = KinoSearch::Analysis::Tokenizer->new( pattern => '\S+' );

    # or...
    my $word_char_tokenizer
        = KinoSearch::Analysis::Tokenizer->new( pattern => '\w+' );

    # or...
    my $apostrophising_tokenizer = KinoSearch::Analysis::Tokenizer->new;

    # Then... once you have a tokenizer, put it into a PolyAnalyzer:
    my $polyanalyzer = KinoSearch::Analysis::PolyAnalyzer->new(
        analyzers => [ $case_folder, $word_char_tokenizer, $stemmer ], );



=head1 DESCRIPTION

Generically, "tokenizing" is a process of breaking up a string into an
array of "tokens".  For instance, the string "three blind mice" might be
tokenized into "three", "blind", "mice".

KinoSearch::Analysis::Tokenizer decides where it should break up the text
based on a regular expression compiled from a supplied C<< pattern >>
matching one token.  If our source string is...

    "Eats, Shoots and Leaves."

... then a "whitespace tokenizer" with a C<< pattern >> of
C<< "\\S+" >> produces...

    Eats, 
    Shoots 
    and 
    Leaves.

... while a "word character tokenizer" with a C<< pattern >> of
C<< "\\w+" >> produces...

    Eats 
    Shoots 
    and 
    Leaves

... the difference being that the word character tokenizer skips over
punctuation as well as whitespace when determining token boundaries.

        pattern => '\w+',    # required
    );

=over

=item *

B<pattern> - A string specifying a Perl-syntax regular expression
which should match one token.  The default value is
C<< \w+(?:[\x{2019}']\w+)* >>, which matches "it's" as well as
"it" and "O'Henry's" as well as "Henry".
