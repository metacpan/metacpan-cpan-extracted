NAME

    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::FFI::CheckLib - FFI::CheckLib alternative to
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::CheckLib

VERSION

    version 1.01

SYNOPSIS

    In your dist.ini:

     [FFI::CheckLib]
     lib = zmq

DESCRIPTION

    This is a Dist::Zilla plugin that modifies the Makefile.PL or Build.PL
    in your distribution to check for a dynamic library FFI::Platypus (or
    similar) can access; uses FFI::CheckLib to perform the check.

    If the library is not available, the program exits with a status of
    zero, which will result in a NA result on a CPAN test reporter.

    This module is adapted directly from Dist::Zilla::Plugin::CheckLib,
    copyright (c) 2014 by Karen Etheridge (CPAN: ETHER). Look there for XS
    modules.

CONFIGURATION OPTIONS

    All options are as documented in FFI::CheckLib:

 lib

    The name of a single dynamic library (for example, zmq). Can be used
    more than once.

    FFI::CheckLib will prepend lib and append an appropriate dynamic
    library suffix as needed.

 symbol

    A symbol that must be found. Can be used more than once.

 systempath

    The system search path to use (instead of letting FFI::CheckLib
    determine paths). Can be used more than once.

 libpath

    Additional path to search for libraries. Can be used more than once.

 recursive

    If set to true, directories specified in libpath will be searched
    recursively.

    Defaults to false.

 verify

    The verify function body to use. For each usage, is one line of the
    function body. You can prefix with the pipe | character to get proper
    indentation.

     verify = | my($name, $libpath) = @_;
     verify = | my $ffi = FFI::Platypus->new;
     verify = | $ffi->lib($libpath);
     verify = | my $f = $ffi->function('foo_version', [] => 'int');
     verify = | if($f) {
     verify = |   return $f->call() >= 500; # we accept version 500 or better
     verify = | } else {
     verify = |   return;
     verify = | }

    If you use any modules, such as FFI::Platypus in this example, be sure
    that you declare them as configure requires.
