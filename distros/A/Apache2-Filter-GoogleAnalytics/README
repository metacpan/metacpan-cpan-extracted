NAME
    Apache2::Filter::GoogleAnalytics - Add GA code to served HTML document

SYNOPSIS
      PerlLoadModule Apache2::Filter::GoogleAnalytics

              PerlOutputFilterHandler Apache2::Filter::GoogleAnalytics
      </Location>

DESCRIPTION
    This module transparently adds a Google Analytics service scriptlet to
    each HTML document that Apache httpd serves. It behaves asynchronous
    pass-thru filter, thus its impact on performance is minimal.

OPTIONS
    WebPropertyID
        A Web Property ID obtained from Google. It can be specified both
        globally and per-resource basis.
