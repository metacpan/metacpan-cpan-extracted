0.98  Thu, Jan 6, 2011
  - ISHIGAKI took over the maintenance.

  - Check ppm.bat in the site/lib directory

0.97  Sat, Sep 19, 2009
  - In PPM::Make::Meta::parse_make, skip MAN3PODS that can appear 
    if some words from @wanted found (patch supllied by Serguei Trouchelle)
  - Address CPAN dist download failure:
     http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=49717
  - Add no_remote_lookup option, which if specified, will not search
    remote databases nor CPAN.pm for information not contained in the
    files of the distribution:
      http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=36798

0.96 Fri, Dec 26, 2008
  - if distro misses NAME, use DISTNAME if available (patch provided by 
    Serguei Trouchelle)
  - fix problem with v-style versions of modules when creating PPD 
    and tgz/zip bundle with --vsr (patch provided by Serguei Trouchelle)
  - omit warning when development version of Archive::Tar is used (patch 
    provided by Serguei Trouchelle).
  - refactor searching for ppm info into PPM::Make::Search
  - use META information available from http://cpan.uwinnipeg.ca/
    so that SOAP::Lite isn't required
  - add the make_ppm_install script, and associated module
    PPM::Make::CPAN, for use as the make_install_make_command
    within CPAN.pm to install modules via ppm.

0.95 Sat, Dec 22, 2007
  - fix architecture string addition (eg, MSWin32-x86-multi-thread-5.10)
    so as to work with perl-5.10

0.94 Sun, June 10, 2007
  - workaround for  a bug in Net::FTP 2.77, which drops the last 
    character on each line when putting file in ASCII mode (provided 
    by Serguey Trouchelle)
  - remove whitespace from version string (provided by Serguey Trouchelle)
  - have settings in Makefile override those in META.yml; in particular,
    this avoids problem of version strings not being updated in
    META.yml (suggested by Serguey Trouchelle)

0.93 Tues, Jan 11, 2007
  - sort summary files by package name

0.92 Thur, Dec 21, 2006

  - wrap parsing of the ppd files in RepositorySummary.pm
    around an eval, to catch errors (suggested by
    Serguey Trouchelle)
  - use CONTENTS exclusively in parse_bundle of Meta.pm
    to exract contents of a Bundle file, as some Bundles
    also include a DESCRIPTION (suggested by
    Serguey Trouchelle)

0.91 Sat, Nov 18, 2006

  - import HAS_PPM from PPM::Make::Config in PPM::Make::Install
  - use VERSION from META.yml only as a last resort, as a number
    of authors forget to update the META.yml:
        https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=22699
  - rename check_opts of PPM::Make::Install to check_opts_install,
    to avoid "subroutine redefinition" warning.
  - use PPM::Make::Meta in PPM::Make::Install
  - add --skip option to PPM::Make::Install to skip running tests

0.89 Sat, Oct 28, 2006

  - add "return 1" to end of make_ppm of PPM::Make, make_bundle
    of PPM::Make::Bundle, and ppm_install of PPM::Make::Install,
    so one can eval() them (suggested by Serguei Trouchelle)
  - if a distribution name can't be found corresponding to a
    dist or mod argument, die at a stage before trying to
    find the non-existent file.

0.88 Wed, Oct 11, 2006

  - fix warnings about an abstract not found in certain cases
  - try NAME and DISTNAME when trying to get info on modules
    and packages from SOAP/CPAN.pm
  - use smaller dummy .tar.gz archives under t/ppms/ for the tests

0.87 Wed, Oct 4, 2006

  - remove PPM::XML::* files from distribution
  - add a skip option to PPM::Make to skip running the tests
  - when building up a list of dependencies, ignore those that
    come with ActivePerl
  - enable parse_ppd() to parse ppd files with multiple
    <IMPLEMENTATION> sections, and have PPM::Make::RepositorySummary
    output summary files with this information
  - add PPM::Make::Bundle to make a zipped bundle file containing
    a package and all of its prerequisites
  - fixes for setting the version number in certain edge cases
    (thanks to Serguei Trouchelle for the patch)
  - if fetch_file() fails on assuming the argument passed is a
    module, try it as a distribution.
  - split methods used in PPM::Make to obtain meta information
    about a distribution into PPM::Make::Meta
  - split functions used in PPM::Make to obtain config information
    into PPM::Make::Config
  - if the author meta information is an array ref, dereference it
    when writing the ppd file

0.83 Fri, Sep 1, 2006

  - use better cross-platform method to guess if a module
    is installed as a core module (reported by Jeff McCarrell)
  - introduce no_html option in PPM::Make (--no-html in make_ppm)
    to disable building of html docs, as some platforms (eg, linux)
    may not have an installhtmldir specified in Perl's Config
    (reported by Jeff McCarrell)
  - introduce --no-cfg as an alias to --no_cfg in make_ppm
  - allow zipped distributions made with the --zipdist option
    to be uploaded to a specified location, just as is done
    with the ppd and tar.gz files
  - in making up a ppd file, fetch either from the remote
    soap server or from CPAN.pm a list of modules for the
    given distribution, and use that to populate PROVIDE
    elements in the ppd file (introduced in ppm4). This can
    be disabled by using the no_pp,4 option in PPM::Make,
    or the --no-ppm4 switch in make_ppm
  - INCOMPATIBLE change: in PPM::Make, change the zip option
    to zip_archive, to enable creation of .zip archives,
    rather than .tar.gz ones.
  - Add PPM::Make::RepositorySummary to make ppm summary files
    (summary.ppm, searchsummary.ppm, package.lst, package.xml)
    for a repository, and add a rep_summary script as an interface

0.79 Mon, Aug 21, 2006
  - fix bug in xml_encode which led to replacing the '&'
    in entitities that were already encoded, such as '&lt;'.

0.78 Wed, Aug 2, 2006
  - drop requirement of PPM, and supply the needed files
    in the distribution, as the PPM distribution will install
    a ppm.bat which overwrites an existing (newer) ppm
    (reported by Serguei Trouchelle)
  - use HTML::Entities to encode fields in ppd file, so
    that high ASCII characters get encoded
    (reported by Serguei Trouchelle)
  - don't die if error results in loading META.yml file
  - rename html_escape routine of PPM::Make::Util to
    xml_encode, to better reflect purpose

0.76 Sat, Jan 8, 2006
  - add dependency on File::HomeDir to obtain $ENV{HOME}
  - allow argument to make_ppm accept a local file as the
    source of a distribution
  - add capability to make a ppm package for a Bundle/Task file,
    to install a list of prerequisites
  - fix loading of CPAN::Config to account for recent CPAN.pm changes
  - add dependency on PPM

0.75 Sat Sep 4 2004
  - adjust the routines for getting module and distribution
    information to accept an array reference of values, and
    return a corresponding hash reference. This cuts down
    particularly on repeated calls to the soap server for
    distributions with more than one prerequisite.
  - fix bug in calling dist_search/mod_search with wrong
    args in some cases when guessing author
  - fix parsing of YAML file in extracting AUTHOR field, if present

0.74 Fri Aug 27 2004
  - add Net::FTP debug messages (thanks to Jeff McCarrell)
  - honor presence of $ENV{HOME}, if present, on Win32
    in looking for the .ppmcfg configuration file (thanks to
    Jeff McCarrell)
  - fix bug where the AUTHOR was reported as an ARRAY ref
    in the ppd file when META.yaml was used
  - attempt to read Module::Build's information file
    only when the _build directory is present.
  - in getting author information, as well as module/distribution
    mappings, in filling out the ppd file, now first try a remote
    soap server, and if that fails, fall back to the CPAN indices.

0.71 Fri Apr 2 11:00:00 2004
  - fix bug in ppm_install for ppm3
  - use $^X rather than $Config{perlpath} for perl binary

0.70 Tue Mar 23 11:00:00 2004
  - fix warning in PPM::Make::Util when CPAN.pm is configured
    but doesn't have a url_list
  - added more checks in make_zipdist of PPM::Make when
    the codebase isn't a local file

0.69 Mon Mar 22 23:00:00 2004
  - use Archive::Zip::AZ_OK(), rather than AZ_OK().

    of the .ppd and the .tar.gz files.

0.68 Sun Jan 11 23:00:00 2004
  - require Archive::Tar >= 1.08 for Win32 to fix A::T bug
  - add --vsp and --vsr flags to add version string to
    ppd and archive files
  - fix bug on non-Win32 when generating ppm packages for
    use on Win32 regarding which files to include in the
    archive [thanks to Mike Schilli]

0.67 Thu Nov 20 20:08:00 2003
  - fix bug in tk-ppm regarding dialogue_yes_no
  - on Win32, only list files in making archive (not directories),
    to quieten newer Archive::Tar

0.66 Wed Sep 10 10:08:00 2003

  - support for ini configuration files added
  - don't include dependencies if they're part of the core,
