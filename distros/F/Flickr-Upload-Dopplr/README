NAME
    Flickr::Upload::Dopplr - Flickr::Upload subclass to assign location
    information using Dopplr

SYNOPSIS
     use Flickr::Upload::Dopplr;

     my %dp_args = ('auth_token' => 'JONES!!!!',
                    'tagify' => 'delicious');

     my %fl_args = ('key' => 'OH HAI',
                    'secret' => 'OH NOES',,
                    'dopplr' => \%dp_args);

     my $uploadr = Flickr::Upload::Dopplr->new(\%fl_args);

     my $photo_id = $uploadr->upload('photo' => "/path/to/photo",
                                     'auth_token' => 'O RLY');

DESCRIPTION
    Flickr::Upload subclass to assign location information using Dopplr.

    Specifically, the package will query Dopplr for the current location of
    the user associated with *$dopplr_authtoken* and assign the following
    tags for the name of the city a machinetag representing the Geonames.org
    ID for that city.

    If the package is able to query a photo's EXIF data and read the
    *DateTimeOriginal* field that value will be used to query Dopplr for
    your location on that day.

    It will also try to resolve a corresponding Flickr Places ID for the
    Geonames city ID returned by Dopplr. For example, Geonames ID *5391959*
    becomes *San Francisco, California, United States* which becomes Flickr
    Places ID *kH8dLOubBZRvX_YZ*.

    (Or in machinetag-speak, *places:locality=kH8dLOubBZRvX_YZ*)

    If, when the photo is uploaded, the Dopplr API thinks that it is a
    "travel day" another machine tag (dopplr:trip=) will be added containing
    the numeric identifier for that trip.

    If an upload is successful, the package will attempt to assign latitude
    and longitude information for the photo with a Flickr accuracy of 11 (or
    "city").

ERROR HANDLING
    Flickr::Upload::Dopplr subclasses Error.pm to catch and throw
    exceptions. Although this is still a mostly un-Perl-ish way of doing
    things, it seemed like the most sensible way to handle the variety of
    error cases. I don't love it but we'll see.

    This means that the library will throw fatal exceptions and you will
    need to code around it using either *eval* or - even better - *try* and
    *catch* blocks.

    There are four package specific exception handlers :

    * FUDException
        An error condition specific to *Flickr::Upload::Dopplr* was
        triggered.

    * FlickrUploadException
        An error condition specific to *Flickr::Upload* was triggered.

    * FlickrAPIException
        An error condition specific to calling the Flickr API (read :
        *Flickr::API*) was triggered.

        This is the only exception handler that defines its own additional
        methods. They are :

        * error_code
            The numeric error code returned by the Flickr API.

        * error_message
            The textual error message returned by the Flickr API.

    * NetDopplrException
        An error condition specific to *Net::Dopplr* was triggered.

CAVEATS
    *   Asynchronous uploads are not support and will trigger an exception.

    *   At the moment, the package does not check to see whether geo
        information was already assigned (for example, via GPS EXIF data)
        nor does it issue and error reporting if there was a problem
        assigning geo information.

PACKAGE METHODS
  __PACKAGE__->new(\%args)
    All the same arguments required by the *Flickr::Upload* constructor plus
    the following :

    * dopplr
        A hash reference containing the following keys :

        * auth_token
            String. *required*

            A valid Dopplr API authentication token.

        * tagify
            String.

            An optional flag to format tags for cities, specific to a
            service. Valid services are :

            * delicious
                City names are lower-cased and spaces are removed.

            * flickr
                City names are wrapped in double-quotes if they contain
                spaces.

            The default value is *flickr*

    Returns a *Flickr::Upload::Dopplr* object.

OBJECT METHODS YOU SHOULD CARE ABOUT
  $obj->upload(%args)
    Nothing you wouldn't pass the Flickr::Upload *upload* method. Except the
    *async* flag which is not honoured yet. I'm working on it.

    In additional, you may pass an optional *geo* parameter. It must be a
    hash reference with the following keys :

    * perms
        Itself a hash reference containing is_public, is_contact, is_family
        and is_friend keys and their boolean values to set the geo
        permissions on your uploaded photo.

        If this is not defined then your default viewing settings for geo
        data will be left in place.

    Returns a photo ID!
