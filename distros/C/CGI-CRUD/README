CGI-CRUD version 1.06
=====================

This module provide a framework to create web forms for a front-end
CRUD interface to a variety of data sources. It features
auto-discovery of the data dictionary for an RDBMS source.

With this framework, you can get a basic CRUD web interface up and
running in minutes without coding. At the same, it allows a great
deal of flexibility for customization by engineers (application
functionality/business logic) and non-engineers (presentation and
style) alike.

For an implementation see Cruddy!
