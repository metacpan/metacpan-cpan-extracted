=head1 UPGRADE INSTRUCTIONS

=head2 Upgrading to v3.0.1

=head3 static_class_info() changes

v3.0.1 introduces a separate class for the static class information. In theory,
this change is backwards-compatible, but future evolutions of DBIx::NinjaORM
may change the internals of C<DBIx::NinjaORM> and break your implementations of
C<static_class_info()>.

It is therefore strongly recommended to modify C<static_class_info()> in your
subclasses as follows:

=over 4

=item * Before:

	sub static_class_info
	{
		my ( $class ) = @_;

		# Load defaults.
		my $info = $class->SUPER::static_class_info();

		# Values specific to this class.
		$info->{'key'} = 'value';
		$info->{'...'} = '...';

		return $info;
	}

=item * After:

	sub static_class_info
	{
		my ( $class ) = @_;

		# Load defaults.
		my $info = $class->SUPER::static_class_info();

		# Values specific to this class.
		# IMPORTANT: now set using set() instead of using a hash assignation.
		$info->set(
			{
				'key' => 'value',
				'...' => '...',
			}
		);

		return $info;
	}

=head3 Deprecated methods

The following methods have been deprecated:

=over 4

=item * get_default_dbh()

Replaced by C<get_info('default_dbh')>.

=item * get_list_cache_time()

Replaced by C<get_info('list_cache_time')>.

=item * get_memcache()

Replaced by C<get_info('memcache')>.

=item * get_object_cache_time()

Replaced by C<get_info('object_cache_time')>.

=item * get_primary_key_name()

Replaced by C<get_info('primary_key_name')>.

=item * get_readonly_fields()

Replaced by C<get_info('readonly_fields')>.

=item * get_table_name()

Replaced by C<get_info('table_name')>.

=item * get_unique_fields()

Replaced by C<get_info('unique_fields')>.

=item * has_created_field()

Those methods will still work for this release, but they will be removed in the
next. In the meantime, they will print out a warning regarding the need to
convert the caller to use the new C<get_info> method.
