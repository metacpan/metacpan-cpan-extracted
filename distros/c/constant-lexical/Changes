Revision history for constant::lexical

2.0002   12 June, 2016
         For  perl 5.18.0  and  higher,  constant::lexical  now  uses
         perl’s built-in lexical subroutine feature,  and  no  longer
         requires Lexical::Sub.

2.0001   8 January, 2012
       •‘use constant::lexical’ with no arguments now works.  (Oops!)
         Thanks to Neil Bowers for reporting this (RT #73694).
       • String evals no longer stop  constants  from  going  out  of
         scope in perl 5.10.x.

2        14 March, 2010
       • True lexical constants for perl 5.11.2 and higher
       • For older perls, we now require constant 1.03 explicitly, so
         users don’t have to.
