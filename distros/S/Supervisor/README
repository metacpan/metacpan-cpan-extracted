Supervisor version 0.08
=======================

The Supervisor modules provide a simple framework to monitor and control
other processes in a *nix like environment. It is partially based on
Supervisord, Proc::Safetynet and POE::Component::Supervisor. For a variety 
of reason these solutions were not practical to install on systems that I had 
to support. So I wrote my own.

INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

    perl Build.PL
    ./Build
    ./Build test
    ./Build install

DEPENDENCIES

These modules requires these other modules and libraries:

    POE
    JSON
    Badger
    DateTime
    File::Pid
    Set::Light
    Config::IniFiles

SUPPORT AND DOCUMENTATION

After installing, you can find documentation for this module with the
perldoc command.

    perldoc Supervisor

There is also sample supervisor and supctl programs in the bin directory 
and sample startup scripts for Debian, RHEL and Novell SUSE in the 
init.d directory.
