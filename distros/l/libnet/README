libnet is a collection of Perl modules which provides a simple
and consistent programming interface (API) to the client side
of various protocols used in the internet community.

For details of each protocol please refer to the RFC. RFCs
can be found in various places on the web, for a starting
point look at:

    http://www.rfc-editor.org/

The RFCs implemented in this distribution are

Net::FTP        RFC959          File Transfer Protocol
Net::SMTP       RFC821          Simple Mail Transfer Protocol
Net::Time       RFC867          Daytime Protocol
Net::Time       RFC868          Time Protocol
Net::NNTP       RFC977          Network News Transfer Protocol
Net::POP3       RFC1939         Post Office Protocol 3

AVAILABILITY

The latest version of libnet is available from the Comprehensive Perl
Archive Network (CPAN). To find a CPAN site near you see:

    http://search.cpan.org/dist/libnet/

The GitHub source repository can be browsed at

    https://github.com/steve-m-hay/perl-libnet

If you have a Git client, then you can checkout the latest code with

    git clone https://github.com/steve-m-hay/perl-libnet.git

DOCUMENTATION

See Changes for recent changes.  POD style documentation is included
in all modules and scripts.  These are normally converted to manual
pages and installed as part of the installation process.  You should
also be able to use the 'perldoc' utility to extract documentation from
the module files directly.

DEMOS

The demos directory does contain a few demo scripts. These should be
run from the top directory like

    demos/smtp.self -user my-email-address -debug

However I do not guarantee these scripts to work.

SUPPORT

Questions about how to use this library should be directed to the
comp.lang.perl.modules USENET Newsgroup.  Bug reports and suggestions
for improvements can be reported on the CPAN Request Tracker at

    https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Report.html?Queue=libnet

Most of the modules in this library have an option to output a debug
transcript to STDERR. When reporting bugs/problems please, if possible,
include a transcript of a run.
