=head1 VERSION

This document describes L<JSONY> version B<0.1.17>.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use JSONY;

    my $data = JSONY->new->load($jsony_string);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

JSONY is a data language that is simlar to JSON, just more chill. All valid
JSON is also valid JSONY (and represents the same thing when loaded), but
JSONY lets you omit a lot of the syntax that makes JSON a pain to write.

=head1 API

JSONY has one instance method: C<load>. You pass it a JSONY string and it
returns the loaded Perl data object.

=head1 JSONY SYNTAX

Here is some examples of JSONY followed by equivalent JSON:

Words don't need quotes. A list of things is an array:

    foo bar baz

    [ "foo", "bar", "baz" ]

Strings with spaces can use single or double quotes:

    'foo bar'      # <= This is (a comment indicating) a string
    # More commenting
    "baz  boom "

    [ "foo bar ", "baz  boom " ]

Top level hashes can be ':' separated pairs or use curlies. Sub hashes
require curlies.

    foo: { bar baz }
    num: -1.2e3

    { "foo": { "bar": "baz" }, "num": -1.2e3 }

Top level arrays can use C<'- '> at the start of lines. Those arrays go the
end of line. Lines can be continued using a trailing comma. Sub arrays require
square brackets.

    - array of 4 scalars
    - array with [ sub
      array { of
      things }]
    - array of 7 things on,
      two lines

    [
      [ "array", "of", 4, "scalars" ],
      [ "array", "with", [ "sub", "array", { "of": "things" } ] ],
      [ "array", "of", 7, "things", "on", "two", "lines" ]
    ]

NOTE: You may want to look at the tests (especially C<t/load.t>) to see the
      full abilities of JSONY.

=head1 STATUS

JSONY has been in use for well over a year. It seems to working well.

Development people are working on this in C<#jsony> and C<#pegex> in
irc.freenode.net. Please drop by.

JSONY.pm is a very simple Pegex-based parser. You can see the quite tiny JSONY
grammar here: L<http://github.com/ingydotnet/jsony-pgx/blob/master/jsony.pgx>

L<http://jsony.org> coming soon.
