# Put this file into any directory, and it will affect any file within
# that directory and all of its subdirectories.  These files are good
# for setting a look and feel for a set of physically related files.
# For example, say you have a directory of files all on one subject, and
# you decide they should all have a blue background.  You could go
# something like this:

@BGCOLOR=#9999FF;

# Please recall that you can NOT "comment out" a directive.  You must
# deactivate it by separating the "@" from the directive name.  

@ NOSIDEBAR=0;

# That directive above is deactivated.

# Note that just about any directive is valid in the LookAndFeelConfig.  
# Depending on the configuration in the main server file, however, most
# directives might be ignored!!  If the server configuration (the file
# pointed to by CONFIG_FILE in the httpd.conf file) has disallowed a 
# whole bunch of things by setting ALLOWBODYMOD, ALLOWNOSIDEBAR, etc to
# 0.  In that case, most of the settings in this file will be ignored. 
# It doesn't hurt to set them, however.

# A few settings will always work.  These are:

# turning on and off the top/bottom navigation bars...

@NAVBAR=0;

# setting the next/up/last links

@ UPLINK=<a href="top.html">Top</a>;

# However, the NEXTLINK/UPLINK/LASTLINK directives really only make sense
# on a file-by-file basis (for example, if you have an online book).  To 
# set them for a whole directory tree is kind of silly, except maybe for
# the uplink.

# The INFO directive is always user-configurable.  If there is no
# sidebar, it won't be used.  It doesn't hurt to set it though.

@ INFO=<A href="http://www.sluggy.com">Sluggy</a>,
            <A HREf="http://www.technotronic.com">Technotronic</a>;

# if you like, check out the documentation (perlmod SetWWWTheme.pm)
# to find out more about the settings that are available.
