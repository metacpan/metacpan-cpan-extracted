DESCRIPTION
    This module provides a Perl interface to the ARIN Whois server. The
    module takes care of connecting to an ARIN whois server, sending your
    whois requests, and parsing the whois output. The whois records are
    returned as lists of Net::Whois::ARIN::* instances.

METHODS
    In the calling conventions below "[]"'s represent optional parameters.

    new - create a Net::Whois::ARIN object
          my $o = Net::Whois::ARIN->new(
            [-hostname=> 'whois.arin.net',]
            [-port    => 43,]
            [-timeout => 45,]
            [-retries => 3,]
          );

        This is the constuctor for Net::Whois::ARIN. The object returned can
        be used to query the whois database.

    query - make a raw query to the whois server
          my @output = $o->query('207.173.112.0');

    network - request a network record
          my @records = $o->network('207.173.112.0');

        This method requires a single argument. The argument indicates the
        network to use in the whois lookup. The method returns a list of
        Net::Whois::ARIN::Network records that matched your search criteria.

    asn - request an ASN record
          my @record = $o->asn(5650);

        This method requires a single argument. The argument indicates the
        autonomous system number to use in the whois lookup. The method
        returns a list of Net::Whois::ARIN::AS objects.

    organization - request an organization record
          my @record = $w->org('ELIX');

    customer - request a customer record
          my @records = $w->customer('ELIX');

    contact - request a point-of-contact record
          my @record = $w->contact('DM2339-ARIN');

    domain - request all records from a given domain
          @output = $w->domain('eli.net');
