Text::Annotated::Line is an OO interface for annotating the
source file and line number to a string of text.

Two special filters derived from Text::Filter are included
for processing Text::Annotated::Line objects:

* Text::Annotated::Reader reads a file line by line and performs
  the annotation.

* Text::Annotated::Writer transforms an array of Text::Annotated::Line
  objects to an output stream, while optionally removing the annotation.
