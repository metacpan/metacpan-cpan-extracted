#========================================================================

#------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Version 0.09 - 27th April 2004
#------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Added 'type' to list of TT2Headers.  If no TT2Headers are specified,
  then it defaults to just 'type', for backwards compatability with 
  earlier versions.  However, if you do have TT2Headers specified, then
  you will need to explicitly add 'type' to the list if you want it sent.
    
    TT2Headers      type length 

* Added TT2ContentType parameter to set a Content-Type other than 
  text/html

    TT2ContentType  text/xml

#------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Version 0.08 - 21st August 2003
#------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Added TT2Wrapper option.

* Fixed documentation to indicate that virtual hosts can have
  separate configurations, but not separate directories, locations,
  files, etc.


#------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Version 0.07 - 13th December 2002               # not released - my bad
#------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Added 'request' parameter.

* Applied a patch from Rick Myers to add ACCESS_CONF to the req_override
  options.

* Change handler() method to create a new service for each unique 
  hostname.  This now handles virtual hosts correctly.

* Added TT2Tolerant, TT2Constant and TT2ConstantsNamespace options.


#------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Version 0.06 - 22nd January 2002
#------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Bumped version number so that PAUSE will allow me to upload it.
  The first attempt to upload 0.05 failed but left a CPAN database 
  entry, preventing me from uploading 0.05 again.


#------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Version 0.05 - 22nd January 2002
#------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Backed out Darren's first patch listed below in 0.04 because it changes
  the nature of, and interface to the various parameters (e.g. env('foo') 
  vs env.foo).  I tried to enclose these items in object wrappers so that
  they can look like hashes but propagate changes back up to the Apache
  request object, but it wasn't easy.  So I've gone with the original 
  behaviour for now until someting better comes along.

* Fixed an "uninitialised value in numeric eq (==)" warning in the 
  Template::Server::Apache module.  Thanks to Pierre Phaneuf for 
  reporting the problem.

* Applied a patch from Darren Chamberlain which adds the 'uploads' option
  to TT2Params for handling file uploads.

* Applied a patch from Rick Myers to prevent the Apache::Template::_merge
  method from merging the same configuration hash together.


#------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Version 0.04 - 15th June 2001
#------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Applied 2 patches from Darren Chamberlain:

  * Form parameters, cookies, pnotes, and the like are closures
    rather than data structures; updates to these from the
    templates themselves are reflected in the request_rec and the
    associated Perl objects. As a consequence, these are called
    as from the templates as [% params('id') %] rather than
    [% params.id %]. Setting these works as you would expect:
    [% params("Fruit", "Lemon") %] sets fruit=lemon.

    ### NOTE: the above change has been backed out in 0.05 ###

  * I fixed a small bug that resulted from the E-tag patch I submitted
    for Apache::Template 0.2.  My patch was md5_hex'ing the reference to
    the content, not the content itself... this is included in the
    attached diff.

  (NOTE: that was my fault - I lost his patch and tried, but failed,
  to recreate it from memory - D'Oh!)

* Applied a patch from Mark Fowler to add the correct pre-reqs for 
  Apache::Request and Apache::ModuleConfig to Makefile.PL.


#------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Version 0.03 - 15th June 2001
#------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Fixed a bug at the point where a service module was instantiated which 
  hard-coded the error code as Template::Service::Apache::ERROR.  Now 
  calls $module->error().

* Removed a stray debugging message which reported installation of a 
  custom SERVICE_HANDLER.

* Applied a patch from Mark Fowler <mark@profero.com> to fix a bug caused
  when you don't have any configuration options specified in httpd.conf.

* Applied another patch from Mark to load the service module (which may
  not be the regular one) via require.

* Applied a patch from Tony Payne <anthonyp@petsmart.com> to correctly
  implement the DIR_CREATE, DIR_MERGE, SERVER_CREATE and SERVER_MERGE
  facilities to support multiple configurations.  He reports that these
  now appear to work OK on later versions of mod_perl.

* Added the E-tag header, thanks to a patch from Darren Chamberlain.


#------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Version 0.02 - 16th Feb 2001
#------------------------------------------------------------------------

* First official public alpha release

* Integrated various bits of code from the "Grover" module and 
  Apache::Template 0.1, as donated by Darren Chamberlain.


#------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Version 0.01
#------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Unofficial pre-release as part of the Template Toolkit 2.01 snapshot.
