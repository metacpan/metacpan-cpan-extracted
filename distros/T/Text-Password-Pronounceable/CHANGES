[Changes for 0.30 - 16 Aug 2010]

* Updated dist metadata and M::I

[Changes for 0.29 (unreleased) - 11 Sep, 2007]

* T::P::P->generate($len) works
* Fix behavior:
       T::P::P->new(2,10)->generate(6) 
  was equivalent to 
       T::P::P->generate(6,10) 
  which is too subtle. Now it works just as 
       T::P::P->generate(6,6)
* Improved warnings on bad arguments

[Changes for 0.28 - 6 Jan, 2007]

* Make ->new take just one $len as well. [Adriano Ferreira]
