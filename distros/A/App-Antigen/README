NAME

    App::Antigen - Plugin Manager for Zsh

SYNOPSIS

      use App::Antigen;
    
      my $app = App::Antigen->new_with_options( plugins => \@plugins );
      $app->run;

DESCRIPTION

    App::Antigen is the underlying code for the antigen-perl tool, which is
    used for managing Zsh plugins. This module is still under development,
    and so the interface is subject to change as new features are added,
    and bugs are found.

 Todo

    There are many things which are still to do in this, including
    supporting upgrades to the plugins as hosted on github, as well as
    adding support for other targets such as normal git repos, tarball
    downloads, and local files and folders. As said before, this module is
    still under development, and may change entirely without warning.

 Attributes

    These are the attributes provided (using MooX::Options). These can also
    be put in the configuration file - see antigen-perl

  output

    This it the output folder into which all the plugin repositories and
    code will be put. Defaults to $HOME/.antigen-perl

  repo

    This is the folder where all the repositories will be stored. Defaults
    to $HOME/.antigen-perl/repos

  output_file

    This is the file which will contain all the calls to the various
    plugins for zsh to load. Defaults to
    $HOME/.antigen-perl/antigen-perl.zsh

  plugins

    This contains an array of hashrefs of the plugins, with the keys as the
    method/place to get the plugins from. Currently only accepts one method
    for getting the plugins, github. An example plugin config:

      my $plugins = [
        github => "TBSliver/zsh-theme-steeef",
        github => "TBSliver/zsh-plugin-extract"
      ];

 Methods

    These are the various methods which are provided, either for internal
    use or for basic usage.

  run

    This is the main method of App::Antigen, and when called will actually
    build the entire plugin structure, according to the plugin options
    specified.

  gen_github_url

    This function generates the github repository URL as required for
    getting the plugins.

  gen_plugin_target

    This function performs a regex on the github url, replacing all colons
    (:) with '-COLON-', and all slashes (/) with '-SLASH-'. This is then
    used as the folder name for the github target.

  github_cmd

    This function pulls together the github url and target folder, and
    actually performs the git command using a call out to system.

  find_plugin

    This finds all the plugins inside the repo directory with a file
    extension of *.plugin.zsh and addes them to the plugin list. This will
    find every occurance of a file with that plugin extension.

  write_output_file

    This takes all the plugins found with the correct extension, and puts
    them in a single file ready to be added to your .zshrc
