NAME
    TL1::Toolkit - Utility functions for interacting with TL1 equipment

VERSION
    0.0.1

DESCRIPTION
    This Perl module is intended to hide the difficult TL1 syntax from the
    user. It executes TL1 commands and returns the results in Perl data
    structures. For example, if you work with different types and/or vendors
    of devices the TL1 syntax might be different as well as the output. This
    TL1 module retrieves information from different types and/or vendors of
    devices without having to know the exact details. There is also a cmd()
    function to execute any TL1 function. In this case the user has to parse
    the returned results. This module is known to work on Nortel OME6500,
    Nortel DWDM CPL, Nortel HDXc, Nortel OM5200, Cisco ONS15454 and Adva
    FSP3000; but it should work on any TL1 capable device.

SYNOPSIS
  my $tl1 = TL1::Toolkit->new("node", "name", "secret");
    Create a TL1::Toolkit object that holds information about a TL1 session.
    Its arguments are:

    *   hostname: network element to connect to

    *   username: login name

    *   password: password

    *   type (optional): device type (OME6500, HDXc)

    *   verbose (optional): debug level (0..9)

  $tl1->open()
    Connect to the TL1 device and login. Returns 1 on success, 0 on failure.

  $tl1->close()
    Logout and disconnect from the TL1 device.

  my $output = $tl1->cmd($command);
    The string variable $command contains a TL1 command string that will be
    sent to the TL1 device as is. It returns the results as ASCII text to
    the string variable $output.

  my $type = $tl1->get_cardtype(1, 12);
    Return the type of card in the shelf given as first argument and the
    slot given as second argument. Returns a string.

  my $version = $tl1->get_swversion();
    Returns the currently active firmware version on the TL1 device. Returns
    a string.

  my $octets = $tl1->get_inoctets(1, 3);
    Returns the Ethernet input octets on the slot given as first argument
    and the port given as second argument. Returns an integer.

  my $octets = $tl1->get_outoctets(7, 2);
    Returns the Ethernet output octets on the slot given as first argument
    and the port given as second argument. Returns an integer.

  my @alarms = $tl1->get_alarms();
    Returns an array of hashes containing information about active alarms on
    the TL1 device. Each entry in the array conatains information about one
    alarm. The keys of each alarm are:

    *   interface

    *   severity

    *   impact

    *   day

    *   time

    *   alarm

    *   year

    *   date

    *   slot

    *   subslot

    *   port

    *   fromfirststs

    Some of the keys can have an "undef" value.

  my @crossconnects = $tl1->get_crossconnects();
    Retrieve information about crossconnects on the TL1 device. The
    information is returned as an array of hashes. Each entry in the array
    is information about one crossconnect. The crossconnect information
    consists of a hash with these keys:

    *   ckid: crossconnect ID

    *   nr_timeslots: total amount of timeslots

    *   from_slot: slot of "from" interface

    *   from_subslot: subslot of "from" interface

    *   from_port: port of "from" interface

    *   from_first_ts: first timeslot on "from" interface

    *   from_last_ts: last timeslot on "from" interface

    *   to_slot: slot of "to" interface

    *   to_subslot: subslot of "to" interface

    *   to_port: port of "to" interface

    *   to_first_ts: first timeslot on "to" interface

    *   to_last_ts: last timeslot on "to" interface

    *   swmate_slot: slot of "switchmate" interface

    *   swmate_subslot: subslot of "switchmate" interface

    *   swmate_port: port of "switchmate" interface

    *   swmate_first_ts: first timeslot on "switchmate" interface

    *   swmate_last_ts: last timeslot on "switchmate" interface

  my $trace = $tl1->get_section_trace(1, 12, 1);
    Return the received section trace on the port given as arguments. The
    first argument is the shelf number, the second argument is the slot
    number and the third argument is the port number. This function returns
    a string.

  $tl1->print_resp($output);
    This function prints the output returned by the cmd() function on
    STDOUT.
