    - If a header param's value somehow ended up as undef, this would produce
      an unitialized value warning. (Dave Rolsky)

    - Fixed a bug in the handling of defaults in content negotiation that
      could lead to errors like: Can't use string ("5") as an ARRAY ref while
      "strict refs" in use at
      /opt/perl5.16.3/lib/site_perl/5.16.3/HTTP/Headers/ActionPack/ContentNegotiation.pm
      line 160. (Dave Rolsky)

    - The PriorityList class treated "q=0" as if it was "q=1". RFC 2616 makes
      it clear that "0" is fine. (Dave Rolsky)

    - Language and character set negotiation now canonicalize all values. This
      means that if you say you provide "UTF-8" and a client requests "utf8"
      it will just work. (Dave Rolsky)
    - There are two new classes, HTTP::Headers::ActionPackage::AcceptCharset
      and AcceptLanguage. (Dave Rolsky)
    - If an Accept-Charset header does not contain "*" or "ISO-8859-1", then
      "ISO-8859-1" is given a priority of 1.0, per RFC-2616. (Dave Rolsky)
    - Content negotiation will never return any item explicitly forbidden
      ("q=0.0") in the headers, even if the header says it accepts "*" or that
      item is specified as a default in your code. (Dave Rolsky)
    - The HTTP::Headers::ActionPack->inflate method now works with
      Web::Request object. (Jesse Luehrs)
    - Fix tests that were broken in the absence of
      HTTP::Message::PSGI. (Florian Ragwitz)

    - fixed the HTTP::Message::PSGI errors
    - when you inflate a header object that has already 
      been inflated, ignore that header and keep looping
        - thanks to Florian Ragwitz for spoting this

0.04 Sun. Sept. 9th, 2012
    - pulling the content negotiation out of
      Web::Machine and moving it into here
        - adding tests accordingly
