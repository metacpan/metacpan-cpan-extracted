NAME
    ORDB::CPANMeta::Generator - Generator for the CPAN Meta database

DESCRIPTION
    This is the module that is used to generate the "CPAN Meta" database.

    For more information, and to access this database as a consumer, see the
    ORDB::CPANMeta module.

    The bulk of the work done in this module is actually achieved with:

    CPAN::Mini - Fetching the index and dist tarballs

    CPAN::Mini::Visit - Expanding and processing the tarballs

    Xtract - Preparing the SQLite database for distribution

METHODS
  new
    The "new" constructor creates a new processor/generator.

  dir
    The "dir" method returns the directory that the SQLite database will be
    written into.

  dsn
    The "dsn" method returns the DBI DSN that is used to connect to the
    generated database.

  run
    The "run" method executes the process that will produce and fill the
    final database.

SUPPORT
    Bugs should be reported via the CPAN bug tracker at
