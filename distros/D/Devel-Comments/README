Devel-Comments version 1.1.4

"I get the feeling that the computer just skips over all the comments."
    -- a grad student

Devel::Comments is a source filter for your Perl code, intended to be used 
only during development. Specially-formatted 'smart' comments are replaced by 
executable code to dump variables to screen or to file, display loop 
progress bars, or enforce conditions. These smart comments can all be 
disabled at once by commenting out the 'use Devel::Comments' line, whereupon
they return to being simple, dumb comments. Your debugging code can remain in 
place, guaranteed harmless, ready for the next development cycle. 

Devel::Comments is a fork of Smart::Comments; the intention is to add new 
features without breaking backward compatibility. Version 1.1.2 implements the
'any filehandle' feature, allowing smart output to go to any filehandle 
opened for writing. You may instead pass in a filename, which DC will open for 
you. Future plans include extended calling syntax, numerical level enabling, 
improved progress bars, dump method callback, and execution of arbitrary code. 
Bugs raised against Smart::Comments 1.0.4 will be fixed in DC.
