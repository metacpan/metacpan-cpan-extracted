Astro-App-Satpass2 is Copyright (C) 2009-2019 by Thomas R. Wyant, III

This package contains an application to predict satellite visibility,
using the Astro::Coord::ECI classes. The following classes are included:

Astro::App::Satpass2 - The application class;
Astro::App::Satpass2::ParseTime - Base class for time parsing;
Astro::App::Satpass2::ParseTime::ISO8601 - Standalone ISO-8601-ish time parser;
Astro::App::Satpass2::ParseTime::Date::Manip - Date::Manip parser base;
Astro::App::Satpass2::ParseTime::Date::Manip::v5 - Date::Manip v5 parser;
Astro::App::Satpass2::ParseTime::Date::Manip::v6 - Date::Manip v6 parser;
Astro::App::Satpass2::Copier - Base class for the helper classes;
Astro::App::Satpass2::Format - Base class for the output formatters;
Astro::App::Satpass2::Format::Dump - Output dumper (for debugging);
Astro::App::Satpass2::FormatTime - Base class for formatting times;
Astro::App::Satpass2::FormatTime::Cldr - Manifest constants for cldr formatting;
Astro::App::Satpass2::FormatTime::DateTime - DateTime common code;
Astro::App::Satpass2::FormatTime::DateTime::Cldr - DateTime cldr formatting;
Astro::App::Satpass2::FormatTime::DateTime::Strftime - DateTime strftime fmtg;
Astro::App::Satpass2::FormatTime::POSIX::Strftime - POSIX strftime fmtg;
Astro::App::Satpass2::FormatTime::Strftime - Manifest const for strftime fmtg;
Astro::App::Satpass2::Utils - Utility functions needed by other modules;
Astro::App::Satpass2::Warner - Manage how warnings are formatted.

In addition, a 'satpass2' script is included, which simply uses
Astro::App::Satpass2 and passes @ARGV to its run() method.

There is also an Astro::App::Satpass2::TUTORIAL to help get started.

There were several motivations for this package:

* There was no good way to test the 'satpass' script that was included
  in the Astro-satpass package. Restructuring it as an object made
  testing easier; in fact, several bugs were found in 'satpass' while
  writing this module.

* Making a break with the old 'satpass' script gave the opportunity to
  rethink a couple implementation decisions in the light of experience,
  and drop obsolete functionality such as the SIMBAD 3 interface and the
  associated setting to determine which SIMBAD interface to use. This
  means that 'satpass2' is not quite command-compatable with 'satpass'.
  The Astro::App::Satpass2 documentation describes the differences.

* The output formatting of the 'satpass' script is not very flexable.

* The dependencies of the 'satpass' script are significantly different
  than those of the Astro::Coord::ECI classes. Separating the two (with
  eventual abandonment of the Astro-satpass package in favor of an
  Astro-Coord-ECI package without the 'satpass' script) means that
  people only interested in the Astro::Coord::ECI classes will not have
  to drag along the dependencies of the script.

INSTALLATION

Most Perl users will want to install using their favorite of either
'cpan' or 'cpanp'. For either of these, installing Astro::App::Satpass2
gets you everything. ActivePerl users will want to use ActiveState's
'ppi', and install Astro-App-Satpass2.

If for some reason none of these works for you, you can download the
distribution and expand it using something like

    tar -xzf Astro-App-Satpass2-9.999.tar.gz

Users of MSWin32 (and perhaps other operating systems) may need to
convert the line endings in the expanded files from Unix to their native
system before proceeding.

Then, issue one of the following two incantations:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    sudo make install

or

    perl Build.PL
    ./Build
    ./Build test
    sudo ./Build install

You should substitute the appropriate program name for 'make', eg nmake
(typically) under MSWin32, or mms or mmk under VMS. See
ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/Softlib/MSLFILES/nmake15.exe for a copy of
nmake for MSWin32 if you need it.

Unix users may want to use 'su' rather than 'sudo' for the install.
Non-unix users may need to be logged in to an administrative or
otherwise privileged accout, and turn on privileges (if applicable) for
the install.

Of course, since it's pure Perl, you can just expand the kit and drop
the .pm files into the App directory (creating it if necessary) in the
appropriate place in your @INC directories.
