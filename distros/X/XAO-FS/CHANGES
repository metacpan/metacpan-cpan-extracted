    * Better treatment of default values and null/undefs
    * MySQL_DBI is split into SQL driver layer and there is a separate
      object XAO::DO::FS::Glue::MySQL that does not use DBI/DBD and
      makes XAO::FS about 2 times faster.
    * Some new tests
    * Cleanups and some speed optimisations
    * All references to dictionary are dropped
    * Benchmarking started to track performance (bench/results-*)

      object
    * Added test case for the bug above
    * check_name method is now available on all FS objects
    * Removed `mysql' directory and dependance on MySQL-devel;
      that driver will be distributed separately.
