DESCRIPTION
    This module is the attempt to use a benefits of caching and 'make'
    concept. If we have many an expensive tasks (a *computations* or
    sometimes here used term as a *recomputing*) and want to cache it we can
    split its to small expsnsive tasks and to describe dependencies for
    cache items.

    This module is experimental yet. I plan to improve it near time but some
    things already work. You can take a look for t/* tests as examples.

CONSTRUCTOR
    $cascade = CHI::Cascade->new( %options )

    This method constructs a new "CHI::Cascade" object and returns it.
    Key/value pair arguments may be provided to set up the initial state.
    Options are:

    chi Required. Instance of CHI object. The CHI::Cascade doesn't construct
        this object for you. Please create instance of "CHI" yourself.

    busy_lock
        Optional. Default is *never*. *This is not "busy_lock" option of
        CHI!* This is amount of time (to see "DURATION EXPRESSIONS" in CHI)
        until all target locks expire. When a target is to being computing
        it is locked. If process which is to be computing target and it will
        die or OS will be hangs up we can dead locks and locked target will
        never recomputed again. This option helps to avoid it. You can set
        up a special busy_lock for rules too.

    target_chi
        Optional. This is CHI cache for target markers. Default value is
        value of "chi" option. It can be useful if you use a "l1_cache" in
        CHI option. So you can separate data of targets from target markers
        - data will be kept in a file cache and a marker in memory cache for
        example.

METHODS
    rule( %options )
        To add new rule to "CHI::Cascade" object. All rules should be added
        before first "run" method

        The keys of %options are (options are passed directly in
        CHI::Cascade::Rule constructor):

        target
            Required. A target for "run" and for searching of "depends". It
            can be as scalar text or "Regexp" object created through "qr//"

        depends
            Optional. The scalar, arrayref or coderef values of
            dependencies. This is the definition of target(s) from which
            this current rule is dependent. If *depends* is:

            scalar
                It should be plain text of single dependence of this target.

            arrayref
                An each item of list can be scalar value (exactly matched
                target) or code reference. If item is coderef it will be
                executed once as $coderef->( $rule, $rule->qr_params ) and
                should return a scalar value as current dependence for this
                target at runtime (the API for coderef parameters was
                changed since v0.16)

            coderef
                This subroutine will be executed once inside *run* method if
                necessary with parameters as: $coderef->( $rule,
                <$rule-qr_params|CHI::Cascade::Rule/qr_params >> ) (API was
                changed since v0.16). It should return scalar or arrayref.
                The returned value is *scalar* it will be considered as
                single dependence of this target and the behavior will be
                exactly as described for *scalar* in this paragraph. If the
                returned value is *arrayref* it will be considered as list
                of dependencies for this target and the behavior will be
                exactly as described for *arrayref* in this paragraph.

        depends_catch
            Optional. This is coderef for dependence exceptions. If any
            dependence from list of "depends"'s option throws an exception
            of type CHI::Cascade::Value by "die" (for example like this
            code: "die CHI::Cascade::Value->new->value( { i_have_problem =>
            1 } )" ) then the $cascade will execute this code as
            "$rule->{depends_catch}->( $this_rule_obj,
            $exception_of_dependence, $rule_obj_of_dependence,
            $plain_text_target_of_dependence )" and you can do into inside a
            following:

            re-"die" new exception of any type
                If your new exception will be type of CHI::Cascade::Value
                you will get the value of this object from "run" method
                immediately (please to see "code" below) without saving in
                cache.

                If exception will be other type this will be propogated
                onward beyond the "run" method

            to do something
                You can make something in this code. After execution of your
                code the cascade re-throws original exception of dependence
                like described above in "re-"die"" section.

                But please notice that original exception has a status of
                "thrown from code" so it can be catched later by other
                "depends_catch" callback from other rule located closer to
                the call hierarchy of "run".

            Please notice that there no way to continue a "code" of current
            rule if any dependence throws an exception!. It because that the
            main concept of execution code of rules is to have all valid
            values (cached or recomputed) of all dependencies before
            execution of dependent code.

        code
            Required. The code reference for computing a value of this
            target (a *computational code*). Will be executed if no value in
            cache for this target or any dependence or dependences of
            dependences and so on will be recomputed. Will be executed as
            "$code->( $rule, $target, $hashref_to_value_of_dependencies )"
            *(The API of running this code was changed since v0.10)*

            If you want to terminate a code and to return immediately from
            "run" method and don't want to save a value in cache you can
            throw an exception from "code" of type CHI::Cascade::Value. Your
            instance of CHI::Cascade::Value can have a value or cannot (a
            valid value can be even "undef"!). A "run" method returns either
            a value is set by you (through "value" in CHI::Cascade::Value
            method) or value from cache or "undef" in other cases. Please to
            see CHI::Cascade::Value

            If "run" method will have a "defer" option as true this code
            will not be executed and you will get a set bit CASCADE_DEFERRED
            in "state" bit mask variable. This may useful when you want to
            control a target execution.

            $rule
                An instance of CHI::Cascade::Rule object. You can use it
                object as accessor for some current executed target data
                (plain text of target, for getting of parameters and so on).
                Please to see CHI::Cascade::Rule

            $target
                The current executed target as plain text for this "code"

            $hashref_to_value_of_dependencies
                A hash reference of values (values are cleaned values not
                CHI::Cascade::Value objects!) of all dependencies for
                current target. Keys in this hash are flat strings of
                dependecies and values are computed or cached ones.

                This module should guarantee that values of dependencies
                will be valid values even if value is "undef". This code can
                return "undef" value as a valid code return but author
                doesn't recommend it. If "CHI::Cascade" could not get a
                valid values of all dependencies of current target before
                execution of this code the last will not be executed (The
                "run" will return "undef").

        params
            Optional. You can pass in your code any additional parameters by
            this option. These parameters are accessed in your rule's code
            through "params" in CHI::Cascade::Rule method of
            CHI::Cascade::Rule instance object.

        busy_lock
            Optional. Default is "busy_lock" of constructor or *never* if
            first is not defined. *This is not "busy_lock" option of CHI!*
            This is amount of time (to see "DURATION EXPRESSIONS" in CHI)
            until target lock expires. When a target is to being computed it
            is locked. If process which to be recomputing a target and it
            will die or OS will be hangs up we can dead locks and locked
            target will never recomputed again. This option helps to avoid
            it.

        recomputed
            Optional. This is a computational callback (coderef). If target
            of this rule was recomputed this callback will be executed right
            away after a recomputed value has been saved in cache. The
            callback will be executed as $coderef->( $rule, $target, $value
            ) where passed parameters are:

            $rule
                An instance of CHI::Cascade::Rule class. This instance is
                recreated for every target searching and recomputing if
                need.

            $target
                A current target as string

            $value
                The instance of CHI::Cascade::Value class. You can use a
                computed value as $value->value

            For example you can use this callback for notifying of other
            sites that your target's value has been changed and is already
            in cache.

        value_expires
            Optional. Sets an CHI's cache expire value for all future target
            markers are created by this rule in notation described in
            "DURATION EXPRESSIONS" in CHI. The default is 'never'. It can be
            coderef or string scalar format as "DURATION EXPRESSIONS" in
            CHI. A coderef should return value in same format.

        ttl Optional. An arrayref for min & max intervals of TTL. Example:
            "[ 60, 3600 ]" - where the minimum ttl is seconds and the
            maximum is 3600 seconds. Targets of this rule will be recomputed
            during from 60 up to 3600 seconds from touched time of any
            dependence this rule. Please read "CASCADE_TTL_INVOLVED" in
            CHI::Cascade::Value too.

    run( $target, %options )
        This method makes a cascade computation if need and returns value
        (value is cleaned value not CHI::Cascade::Value object!) for this
        target If any dependence of this target of any dependencies of
        dependencies were (re)computed this target will be (re)computed too.

        The run method of instance of cascade can be called from other run
        method of same instance and from "callref" function inside "depends"
        rule's option. This was made possible by creating a separate data
        instance for each root call of run method. This can come in handy
        when you compute dependencies on the go, which are computed by the
        same object (instance) of "cascade".

        $target
            Required. Plain text string of target.

        %options
            Optional. And all options are optional too A hash of options.
            Valid keys and values are:

            state
                A scalarref of variable where will be stored a state of
                "run". Value will be a bit mask.

            defer
                If value will be a true then computational code will not be
                run if there is a need. After "run" you can test status of
                returned value - it should be (re)computed or not by bit
                "CASCADE_DEFERRED" in saved "state" variable. If the
                CASCADE_DEFERRED bit is set you can recall "run" method
                again or re-execute target in other process for a
                non-blocking execution of current process.

            actual_term
                The value in seconds (a floating point value) of actual
                term. The actual term is period when dependencies to be
                checked for $target in "run" method. If this option is not
                defined then the "run" method checks a dependencies of
                $target every time in runtime. But sometimes (when a target
                has many dependencies) we could want to reduce an amount of
                dependencies checks. For example if "actual_term" will be
                defined as 2.5 this will mean to check a dependencies only
                every 2.5 seconds. So recomputing in this example can be
                recomputed only one time in every 2.5 seconds (even if one
                from dependencies will be updated). But if value of $target
                is missing in cache a recomputing can be run regardless of
                this option.

            ttl A scalarref for getting current TTL for value of 'run'
                target. The TTL is "time to live" as TTL in DNS. If any rule
                in a path of following to dependencies has ttl parameter
                then the cascade will do there:

                1.  will look up a time of this retouched dependence;

                2.  if rule's target marker already has a upper time and
                    this time in future the target will be recomputed in
                    this time in future and before this moment you will get
                    a old data from cache for 'run' target. If this time is
                    there and has elapsed cascade will use a standard
                    algorithm.

                3.  will look up the rule's ttl parameter (min & max ttl
                    values) and will generate upper time of computation of
                    this rule's target and will return from "run" method old
                    data of 'run' target. Next "run"s executions will return
                    old values of any targets where this TTL-marked target
                    is as dependence.

                4.  In any case if old value misses in cache the cascade
                    will recompute codes.

                This feature was made for *reset* situation. For example if
                we have 'reset' rule and all rules depend from this one rule
                the better way will be to have 'ttl' parameter in every rule
                except 'reset' rule. So if rule 'reset' will be retouched
                (or deleted) other targets will be recomputed during time
                from 'min' and 'max' intervals from 'reset' touched time. It
                reduce a server's load. Later i will add examples for this
                and will document this feature more details. Please read
                "CASCADE_TTL_INVOLVED" in CHI::Cascade::Value too.

            stash
                A *hashref* to stash - temporary data container between
                rule's codes. Please see "stash ()" method for details.

    touch( $target )
        This method refreshes the time of this target. Here is analogy with
        touch utility of Unix and behaviour as make(1) after it. After
        "touch" all targets are dependent from this target will be
        recomputed at next "run" with an appropriate ones.

    target_remove ( $target )
        It's like a removing of target file in make. You can force to
        recompute target by this method. It will remove target marker if one
        exists and once when cascade will need target value it will be
        recomputed. In a during recomputing of course cascade will return an
        old value if one exists in cache.

    stash()
        Deprecated! It returns *hashref* to a stash. A stash is hash for
        temporary data between rule's codes. It can be used only from inside
        "run". Example:

            $cascade->run( 'target', stash => { key1 => value1 } )

        and into rule's code:

            # DEPRECATED - OLD METHOD! It's supported and works but please don't use it
            $rule->cascade->stash->{key1}

            # NEW METHOD:
            $rule->stash->{key1}

        If a "run" method didn't get stash hashref the default stash will be
        as empty hash. You can pass a data between rule's codes but it's
        recommended only in special cases. For example when run's target
        cannot get a full data from its target's name.

STATUS
    This module is experimental and not finished for new features ;-) Please
    send me issues through <https://github.com/Perlover/CHI-Cascade> page

ANALOGIES WITH make
    Here simple example how it works. Here is a direct analogy to Unix make
    utility:

        In CHI::Cascade:            In make:

        rule                        rule
        depends                     prerequisites
        code                        commands
        run( rule_name )            make target_name

FEATURES
    The features of this module are following:

    Computing inside process
        If module needs to compute item for cache we compute inside process
        (no forks) For web applications it means that one process for one
        request could take a some time for computing. But other processes
        will not wait and will get either old previous computed value or
        *undef* value.

    Non-blocking computing for concurrent processes
        If other process want to get data from cache we should not block it.
        So concurrent process can get an old data if new computing is run or
        can get *undef* value. A concurrent process should decide itself
        what it should do after it - try again after few time or print some
        message like 'Please wait and try again' to user.

    Each target is splitted is two items in cache
        For optimization this module keeps target's info by separately from
        value item. A target item has lock & timestamp fields. A value item
        has a computed value.

EXAMPLE
    For example please to see the SYNOPSIS

    When we prepared a rules and a depends we can:

    If unique_name_other1 and/or unique_name_other2 are(is) more newer than
    unique_name the unique_name will be recomputed. If in this example
    unique_name_other1 and unique_name_other2 are older than unique_name but
    the unique_name_other3 is newer than unique_name_other1 then
    unique_name_other1 will be recomputed and after the unique_name will be
    recomputed.

    And even we can have a same rule:

        $cascade->rule(
            target  => qr/^unique_name_(.*)$/,
            depends => sub { 'unique_name_other_' . $_[1] },
            code    => sub {
                my ($rule, $target_name, $values_of_depends) = @_;

                # $rule->qr_params          === ( 3 )
                # $target_name              == 'unique_name_3' if $cascade->run('unique_name_3') was
                # $values_of_depends        == {
                #     unique_name_other_3   => $value_ref_3
                # }
            }
        );

        $cascade->rule(
            target  => qr/unique_name_other_(.*)/,
            code    => sub {
                my ($rule, $target_name, $values_of_depends) = @_;
                ...
            }
        );

    When we will do:

        $cascade->run('unique_name_52');

    $cascade will find rule with qr/^unique_name_(.*)$/, will make =~ and
    will find a depend as unique_name_other_52
