NAME
    lexical::underscore - access your caller's lexical underscore

SYNOPSIS
       use 5.010;
       use lexical::underscore;
       use Test::More;
   
       sub is_uppercase {
          my $var = @_ ? shift : ${lexical::underscore()};
          return $var eq uc($var);
       }
   
       my $thing = 'FOO';
       my $works = 0;
   
       given ( $thing ) {
          when ( is_uppercase ) { $works++ }
       }
   
       ok($works);
       done_testing();

DESCRIPTION
    Starting with Perl 5.10, it is possible to create a lexical version of the
    Perl default variable $_. Certain Perl constructs like the `given` keyword
    automatically use a lexical $_ rather than the global $_.

    It is occasionallly useful for a sub to be able to access its caller's $_
    variable regardless of whether it was lexical or not. The `(_)` sub
    prototype is the official way to do so, however there are sometimes
    disadvantages to this; in particular it can only appear as the final
    required argument in a prototype, and there is no way of the sub
    differentiating between an explicitly passed argument and $_.

    This caused me problems with Scalar::Does, because I wanted to enable the
    `does` function to be called as either:

       does($thing, $role);
       does($role);  # assumes $thing = $_

    With `_` in the prototype, $_ was passed to the function at the end of its
    argument list; effectively `does($role, $thing)`, making it impossible to
    tell which argument was the role.

    Enter `lexical::underscore` which allows you to access your caller's
    lexical $_ variable as easily as:

       ${lexical::underscore()}

    You can access lexical $_ further up the call stack using:

       ${lexical::underscore($level)}

    If you happen to ask for $_ at a level where no lexical $_ is available,
    you get the global $_ instead.

    This module does work on Perl 5.8 but as there is no lexical $_, always
    returns the global $_.

  Technical Details
    The `lexical::underscore` function returns a scalar reference to either a
    lexical $_ variable somewhere up the call stack (using PadWalker magic),
    or to the global $_ if there was no lexical version.

    Wrapping `lexical::underscore` in `${ ... }` dereferences the scalar
    reference, allowing you to access (and even assign to) it.
