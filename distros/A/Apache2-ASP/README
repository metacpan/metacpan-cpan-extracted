DESCRIPTION
    Apache2::ASP scales out well and has brought the ASP programming model
    to Perl in a new way.

    This rewrite had a few major goals:

    * Master Pages
        Like ASP.Net has, including nested Master Pages.

    * Partial-page caching
        Like ASP.Net has.

    * Better configuration
        The original config format was unsatisfactory.

    * Handle multiple VirtualHosts better.
        Configuration was the root of this problem.

        NOTE: If you use an ORM, make sure your ORM doesn't have any
        "global" configuration object in memory, unless it is schema-aware.
        DBIx::Class is good and Class::DBI::Lite also works well with
        Apache2::ASP. Do not use Class::DBI with Apache2::ASP because of
        configuration overlap problems which arise when you have 2 tables
        with the same name in 2 different databases.

    * Better performance
        Server resources were being wasted on unnecessary activities like
        storing session state even when it had not changed, etc.
