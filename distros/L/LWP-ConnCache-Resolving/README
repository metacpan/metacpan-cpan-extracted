LWP-ConnCache-Resolving version 0.01
====================================

This module can be used to add resolution to standard LWP::ConnCache.

It might be useful if you have multiple hostnames that result in the same
logical connection which can be interchangably used for all of them
(either have the same IP address or connect to the same farm of load
balanced servers, for example).

WARNING: be careful with HTTP load balancers which sometimes use Host
header to keep connection to different backend servers - this connection
might not be reusable for request with different Host headers even if
hostname resolves to the same IP address.

Module itself does not define a resolution mechanism leaving it to the
user to define (I'll probably write DNS resolver as pre-canned module
in the future).

For code examples see module documentation.
