2.006.1: Actually documented changes in 2.006

2.006: Disabled one of the taint tests (t/05-real.pl, test 13), since it
breaks with perl 5.6.1 and I can't yet think of a good way to retain
the functionality.

2.005: Fixed an infinite-loop bug affecting the use of parenthesized
conditionals involving comparisons on metachars.  Actually, I'm surprised
this didn't show up earlier, since it should have broken all sorts of
things.  Thanks to Thomas Burholder <burkhold at dogrobber.com> for the
report.

2.004: Fixed a dumb oversight in test suite where valid comparison
strings assumed that the iteration order in a hash would be consistent
and predictable.  Passes make-test under perl5.6 now.

2.0: Major rewrite.  Introduced lexical parsing, nested conditionals,
list/hash formatting, subroutine references, operator evaluation and
much other related stuff.

0.9.8: Added subroutine-reference parsing.  This makes it possible to
bind keys to subroutines which will be called (once per template)
when needed; this can make things quicker if the template-specific
informational requirements may not be easily predicted in advance.

0.9.7: Made stripping of lingering keys optional (default off); it
was causing problems with URI-encoded substitutions, and in
retrospect probably was not a good idea anyway.  Thanks to Ian Baker
<ian@sonic.net> for the bug report.

0.9.6.1: Fixed stupid idiotic bug caused by overzealous optimization (some
things were not meant to be done with references -- setting cache scalars,
for iinstance).  Renamed from ParsePrint to BasicTemplate for submission to
CPAN.  Fixed oversight wherein files inserted via simple_ssi #includes were
having keys stripped, but not parsed first.

First fully public release.  Hooray...

0.9.6: Rewrote argument handling in constructor the same way;
deprecated old style arg passage.

0.9.5: Rewrote argument handling in parse_push to handle arbitrary
combinations of different arg types.

0.9.4.1: Fixed nasty bug that set the lvalue in comparison to
the name of the entitity lvalue, not the value thereof.

0.9.4: Lots of optimizations.  Inlined eval_conditional(),
introduced caching of condititionals (parse-once, print repeatedly),
other such changes.  Approximately doubled output speed to about
3100 conditionals/sec on my i686-200 Linux box.

0.9.3: First stable, releaseable version.  Much documentation.
