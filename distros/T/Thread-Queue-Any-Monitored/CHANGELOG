1.03    7 December 2012
        Upgraded to Devel::MaintBlead 0.08.  This should fix the problem as
        reported in https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=81354 by
        Justin Traer.  Also upgraded the maint version to 0.13.

1.02    6 June 2012
        Fixed problem in test-suite that hard depended on Thread::Serialize
        being installed.  Spotted by Chris Williams (BINGOS) through
        CPAN-Testers.

        Also implemented some code esthetics suggestions made at last night's
        Amsterdam PM meeting, both in maint and blead version.

        Updated threadsforks / maintblead logic to latest and greatest.

        Upped the maint version to 0.12, because the monitor logic now has
        two extended code paths for defined and undefined exit values.  This
        should give a noticeable performance improvement.

1.01    4 June 2012
        Upgraded to Devel::ThreadsForks 0.05 and Devel::MaintBlead 0.04.
        Also upgraded the maint version to 0.11.

1.00    2 June 2012
        The threads/forks check is now done by Devel::ThreadsForks.  Added
        support for maint/blead versions using Devel::MaintBlead.  Updated
        the "blead" test-suite to the new features of Test::More.

        Added documentation for the serializer features which are inherited
        from the new, improved Thread::Queue::Any.

        The maint version has been upped to 0.10 to differentiate it from
        0.09 with regards to the installation process.  Fixed typo in tests
        that would check for existence of methods in the wroing class.

0.09    1 April 2012
        Some code refactoring and code esthetics.  Verified it runs on 5.14.2.

0.08    3 October 2007
        Hopefully fixed test-suite for non-thread enabled Perls.  Updated
        to use new VERSION feature of Devel::Required.

        28 January 2004
        Made sure the test-suite cleans up on multi-versioned systems.

0.07    28 December 2003
        Added automatic required modules update using Devel::Required.

0.06    13 August 2003
        Cleaned up Makefile.PL and updated copyright info.  Made sure the
        test-suite runs ok with warnings enabled.

        Removed our and ":unique" attribute as with all of my other Thread::xxx
        modules.

0.05    24 July 2002
        Made $VERSION and @ISA have the : unique attribute to save memory.

        Fixed some documentation nits.

        23 July 2002
        Fixed problem with warnings if an undefined exit value was used
        (the default).

0.04    21 July 2002
        Added "can_ok" test to test-suite.

        Renamed dummy "dequeue_nb" to "dequeue_dontwait" to be more in line
        with Thread::Pool.  Added synonym "dequeue_nb" for compatibility.

0.03    18 July 2002
        Added support for "post" routine, so that a routine will be executed
        when monitoring stops.  Results of the "post" routine are available
        with the "join" method on the thread object.

0.02    17 July 2002
        Added class method "self" for use within the "pre" or "monitor"
        routine the Thread::Queue::Any::Monitored object they're working for.

        Changed the input parameters of "new" to be more like those of
        Thread::Pool->new.  This is incompatible with the way it was
        before.  Fortunately there won't be that many people hurt by
        it.  Adapted the test-suite accordingly.

0.01    17 July 2002
        First version of Thread::Queue::Any::Monitored.
