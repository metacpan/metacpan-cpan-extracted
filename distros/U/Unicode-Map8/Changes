   Release 0.08

   A little patch to Makefile.PL from Andreas König that makes the
   umap program install by default.

   Added some Unicode::Map8 compatibility stuff to the interface.
   The constructor can now take a hash argument with the hash element
   'ID' specifying the coding.  The method names from_unicode() and
   to_unicode() are now aliases for to8() and to16().

1998-02-13   Gisle Aas <aas@sn.no>

   Release 0.03

   Renamed 'map8.c' to 'map8x.c' because some bad systems would
   overwrite it with 'Map8.c'.

   Attach mapper using magic.  The Unicode::Map8 object is now a
   plain HASH.  That should help when subclassing.

   supported by the callbacks yet.
