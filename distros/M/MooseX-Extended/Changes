0.01      2022-05-24 09:44:44 CEST

          - Reorganize docs to provide links to a manual
          - Make cloning much more flexible (thanks to Leon Timmermans for
            pointing out that my previous approach wasn't enough).
          - Start adding exceptions
          - Throw exceptions if attribute names or shortcut names are invalid
          - Support v5.20.0

          - Trial support for `clone => 1`
          - Roles will now warn if a class overrides a role method without
            excluding it (in Moose, the class silently ignores the role method)

          - Role support added
          - make_immutable is now the default (thanks, haarg)
