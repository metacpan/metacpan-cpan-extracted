Text-Tags version 0.04

Text::Tags is a folksonomy parser.  It takes a string of space-separated "tags"
and splits them.  You can include spaces in tags by putting them in "double quotes"
or 'single quotes'.  There is no backslash-escaping.  All whitespace is compressed to a single
space.

A major feature is that there are no "error cases" -- *every* possible string parses
successfully.  (However, there are a few types of strings that can't appear in a tag,
generally involving tags that contain both single and double quotes.)
