          [rt.cpan.org #77624]

3.004     2011-02-18

          If present, MIME::Entity must be v5.501; v5.500 had a regression (or
          a bug fix, depending how you look at it) that broke header-reading.
          While technically older versions that are not 5.500 would work, it is
          much simpler to just require the newest version, rather than to
          support a version range with a hole in it.
