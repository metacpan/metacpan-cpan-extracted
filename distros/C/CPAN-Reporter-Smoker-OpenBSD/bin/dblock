=head1 dblock

dblock - program to write a distribution preferences files to disable the smoker from testing it

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    dblock --distro='ARFREITAS/Siebel-Srvrmgr'

=head1 OPTIONS

=over

=item B<--distro>

This parameter expects a string describing the Perl distribution to be disabled regarding testing on the smoker.
The string must have the format <AUTHOR>/<DISTRIBUTION>.
This is a required parameter: not providing it will cause the program to abort with an error.

=item B<--help>

This help message.

=item B<--comment>

Addeds a customized comment to the distroprefs file. It's entirely optional, and if not given, the default text will
be the string C<Tests hang smoker>. Sometimes you want to add an distroprefs when, for example, the distribution uses
too much disk space, and an different message will help to identify that.

=item B<--version>

Prints the version number and exits.

=back

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This program creates a YAML file that describes a Perl distribution preferences specifically to disable L<CPAN::Reporter> to skip
trying to test the distribution itself.

Sometimes this is required to be included for CPAN Smokers (see L<CPAN::Reporter::Smoker>) because some distributions just cannot be tested
automatically and makes a smoker to hand during the tests, having the related processes to be terminated manually.

The YAML file will be created on the respective home directory of the user, followed by C<.cpan> and C<prefs>.

See L<CPAN::Reporter> Pod for details. You can check examples of those files on this project webpage at Github. Those preferences files were
created during several tests executed.
