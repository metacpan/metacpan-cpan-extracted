NAME

    MooseX::Util - Moose::Util extensions

VERSION

    This document describes version 0.006 of MooseX::Util - released June
    26, 2015 as part of MooseX-Util.

SYNOPSIS

        use MooseX::Util qw{ ensure_all_roles with_traits };
    
        # profit!

DESCRIPTION

    This is a utility module that handles all of the same functions that
    Moose::Util handles. In fact, most of the functions exported by this
    package are simply re-exports from Moose::Util, so you're recommended
    to read the documentation of that module for a comprehensive view.

    However.

    We've re-implemented a number of the functions our parent provides, for
    a variety of reasons. Those functions are documented here.

FUNCTIONS

 with_traits(<classname> => (<trait1>, ... ))

    Given a class and one or more traits, we construct an anonymous class
    that is a subclass of the given class and consumes the traits given.
    This is exactly the same as "with_traits" in Moose::Util, except that
    we use "create_anon_class" in MooseX::Util::Meta::Class to construct
    the anonymous class, rather than "create_anon_class" in
    Moose::Meta::Class directly.

    Essentially, this means that when we do:

        my $anon_class_name = with_traits('Zombie::Catcher', 'SomeTrait');

    For $anon_class_name we get:

        Zombie::Catcher::__ANON__::SERIAL::1

    Rather than:

        Moose::Meta::Class::__ANON__::SERIAL::1

    This is nice because we have an idea of where the first anonymous class
    came from, whereas the second one could could be from anywhere.

 is_private

        # true if "private"
        ... if is_private('_some_name');

    Ofttimes we need to determine if a name is considered "private" or not.
    By convention, method, attribute, and other names are considered
    private if their first character is an underscore.

    While trivial to test for, this allows us to centralize the tests in
    one place.

    Please note I do not expect to be gittip'ed or flattr'ed for this work,
    rather it is simply a very pleasant surprise. I largely create and
    release works like this because I need them or I find it enjoyable;
    however, don't let that stop you if you feel like it ;)
