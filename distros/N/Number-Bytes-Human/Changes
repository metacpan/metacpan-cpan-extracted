0.06 Thu Oct 26 2006
         - Martin Ward pointed to me:
           * [FIX] the SI prefix for bytes in base 1024 is still 'B', 
             not 'iB'
           * floppy disk manufacturers count in units of 1024000 (for
             their "1.44 MB" disks) [NEW OPTION: bs => 1024000]
         - in the OO code, indirect notation "new Number::Bytes::Human"
           was replaced by "Number::Bytes::Human->new"

0.05 Wed Oct 25 2006
         - nothing new here
         - added taint checking to tests "#!perl -T\n"

         - now default suffix for kilobytes (base 1000) is 'k', not 'K'
         - now 'suffixes' option support 1024, 1000, si_1024, and si_1000

0.03 Tue Oct  4 2005
        - some idle changes, like fixing 'si' option behavior
        - added new test "t/06si.t"
        - the (yet) undocumented option 'unit'
        - a test script "t/07unit.t"
