NAME
    POE::Component::IRC::Plugin::Hailo - A PoCo-IRC plugin which provides
    access to a Hailo conversation simulator.

SYNOPSIS
    To quickly get an IRC bot with this plugin up and running, you can use
    App::Pocoirc:

     $ pocoirc -s irc.perl.org -j '#bots' -a 'Hailo{ "brain_resource": "brain.sqlite" }'

    Or use it in your code:

     use POE::Component::IRC::Plugin::Hailo;

     $irc->plugin_add('Hailo', POE::Component::IRC::Plugin::Hailo->new(
         Own_channel    => '#bot_chan',
         Ignore_regexes => [ qr{\w+://\w} ], # ignore lines containing URLs
         Hailo_args     => {
             brain_resource => 'brain.sqlite',
         },
     ));

DESCRIPTION
    POE::Component::IRC::Plugin::Hailo is a POE::Component::IRC plugin. It
    provides "intelligence" through the use of POE::Component::Hailo. It
    will talk back when addressed by channel members (and possibly in other
    situations, see "new"). An example:

     --> hailo_bot joins #channel
     <Someone> oh hi there
     <Other> hello there
     <Someone> hailo_bot: hi
     <hailo_bot> oh hi there

    It will occasionally send CTCP ACTIONS (/me) too, if the reply in
    question happens to be based on an earlier CTCP ACTION from someone.

    All NOTICEs are ignored, so if your other bots only issue NOTICEs like
    they should, they will be ignored automatically.

    Before using, you should read the documentation for Hailo, so you have
    an idea of what to pass as the 'Hailo_args' parameter to "new".

    This plugin requires the IRC component to be POE::Component::IRC::State
    or a subclass thereof.

METHODS
  "new"
    Takes the following optional arguments:

    'Hailo', a reference to an existing POE::Component::Hailo object you
    have lying around. Useful if you want to use it with multiple IRC
    components. If this argument is not provided, the plugin will construct
    its own object.

    'Hailo_args', a hash reference containing arguments to pass to the
    constructor of a new Hailo object.

    'Channels', an array reference of channel names. If this is provided,
    the bot will only listen/respond in the specified channels, rather than
    all channels.

    'Own_channel', a channel where it will reply to all messages. The plugin
    will take care of joining the channel. It will part from it when the
    plugin is removed from the pipeline. Defaults to none.

    'Abuse_interval', default is 60 (seconds), which means that user X in
    channel Y has to wait that long before addressing the bot in the same
    channel if he wants to get a reply. Setting this to 0 effectively turns
    off abuse protection.

    'Talkative', when set to a true value, the bot will respond whenever
    someone mentions its name (in a PRIVMSG or CTCP ACTION (/me)). If false,
    it will only respond when addressed directly with a PRIVMSG. Default is
    false.

    'Ignore_masks', an array reference of IRC masks (e.g. "purl!*@*") to
    ignore.

    'Ignore_regexes', an array reference of regex objects. If a message
    matches any of them, it will be ignored. Handy for ignoring messages
    with URLs in them.

    'Method', how you want messages to be delivered. Valid options are
    'notice' (the default) and 'privmsg'.

    'Replyrate', when set to a number (a percentage, 0 to 100) controls how
    often the bot will respond to any message. Uses a uniform RNG and fires
    whenever the random roll is less than this number.

    Returns a plugin object suitable for feeding to POE::Component::IRC's
    "plugin_add" method.

  "brain"
    Takes no arguments. Returns the underlying POE::Component::Hailo object
    being used by the plugin.

  "transplant"
    Replaces the brain with the supplied POE::Component::Hailo instance.
    Shuts down the old brain if it was instantiated by the plugin itself.
