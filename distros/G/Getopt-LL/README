SYNOPSIS
         use Getopt:LL qw(getoptions);
     
     my $use_foo = 0;
     
     my $options = getoptions({
             '-t'            => 'string',
             '--verbose|-v'  => 'flag',
             '--debug|-d'    => 'digit',
             '--use-foo'     => sub {
                 $use_foo = 1;
             },
             '-output|-o'    => sub {
                 my ($getopt, $node) = @_;
                 my $next_arg = $getopt->get_next_arg($node);
     
             if ($next_arg eq '-') {
                     $out_to_stdout = 1;
                 }
     
             return $next_arg;
             };
         });

DESCRIPTION
    Getopt::LL provides several ways for defining the arguments you want.
    There is Getopt::LL::Simple for defining arguments on the -use-line-,
    Getopt::LL::Short for abbreviated rules (that looks like Getopt::Long).

  RULES
    -Rules- is the guidelines Getopt::LL follows when it meets new options.
    The rules defines what options we want, which options are required, and
    what to do with an option.

    A simple rule-set could be written like this:

         my $rules = {
             '-foo'      => 'string',
             '-bar'      => 'string',
             '--verbose' => 'digit',
             '--debug'   => 'flag',
         };

   Rule types/actions.
    The argument to an rule is what we call a rule type or rule action. It
    can be one of the following:

    *   'flag'

    The option is a flag. The value of the option will be boolean true.

    *   'string'

    The option is a string. The value of the option will be the next
    argument in the argument list.

    *   'digit'

    The option is a number. The value of the option will be the next
    argument in the argument list. The value will be sent to
    "is_digit($value)" to check that it's really a number. If it's not a
    number and the "die_on_type_mismatch" option is set, the program will
    die with a type mismatch error message.

    A digit can also be a hex value if it begins with -0x-, any hex value
    will be converted to a decimal value.

    *   A regular expression: "qr/ /"

    The next argument will be matched against the regular expression. If it
    doesn't match the program will die with the message

         Argument [--arg] doesn't match [regular-expression].

    *   An anonymous subroutine. "sub { }"

    The sub-routine will be called with the following arguments

    1.  $_[0] - The Getopt::LL object.

    2.  $_[1] - The current argument node (A Getopt::LL::DLList::Node]
        object).

    3.  $_[2] - The argument name.

    4.  $_[3] - If an argument value was set by the user with "--arg=value",
        the value is in this variable.

    The return value of the anonymous subroutine will be the value of the
    option.

    Here is an example of a rule sub that simply assigns the value of the
    next argument to the option value:

         my $rules = {
     
         '-foo'  => sub {
                 my ($getopt, $node, $arg_name, $arg_value) = @_;
                     return $arg_value if $arg_value;
     
                 my $next_arg = $getopt->get_next_arg($node);
     
                 return $next_arg;
             },
         };
     
     my $result = getoptions($rules);
     
     print 'FOO IS: [', $result->{'-foo'}, "]\n";

    if this program is called with the arguments: "-foo bar" or "-foo=bar"
    it will print out this message:

         FOO IS [bar]

   Specifying required arguments.
    There are two ways of specifying required arguments.

    *   Embedded in the rule name, by an exclamation point !.

         my $rules = {
             '-foo!' => 'string',
         };

    *   Or by adding the "required" flag.

         my $rules = {
             '-foo'  => {
                 type        => 'string',
                 required    => 1,
             },
         }

   Adding default values to non-required arguments.
    There are two ways of specifying default values.

    *   Embedded in the rule name, inside parens ( .. )

         my $rules = {
             '-bar(defaultValue)' => 'string',
         };

    *   Or by adding a "default" key to the spec.

         my $rules = {
             '-bar'  => {
                 type    => 'string',
                 default => 'defaultValue',
             },
         };

  DID YOU SAY SIMPLE?
    With Getopt::LL::Simple you can define the arguments you want on the
    -use-line-:

         #!/usr/bin/perl
         use strict;
         use warnings;
     
     # we have three arguments:
         #   -f!          (our filename, which is a s(tring) the ! means that it's
         #               a required argument.
         #   --verbose   (print extra information about what we're doing, is a flag).
         #   --debug     (the level of debugging information to print. is a
         #                d(igit).
         #
         use Getopt::LL::Simple qw(
             -f!=s
             --verbose
             --debug|d=d
         );
     
     if ($ARGV{'--verbose'}) {
             print "In verbose mode...\n";
         }
     
     if ($ARGV{'--debug'}) {
             print 'Debugging level is set to: ', $ARGV{'--debug'}, "\n";
         }
     
     print "The contents of @ARGV is:\n";
         prnit "\t", join{q{, }, @ARGV), "\n";

    The options that was found is placed into %ARGV, the arguments that is
    not an option is placed into @ARGV. So say we have run the program with
    the following arguments:

         ./myprogram -f tmp.log --verbose --debug=3 foo bar

    or

         ./myprogram -f tmp.log --verbose --debug 3 foo bar

    it will give this output:

         In verbose mode...
         Debugging level is set to: 3
         The contents of @ARGV is:
             foo, bar

SUBROUTINES/METHODS
  CONSTRUCTOR
   "new(\%rules, \%options, \@opt_argv )"
    Uses @ARGV if no "\@opt_argv" is present.

  ATTRIBUTES
   "rules"
   "set_rules"
    The list of rules passed to "new".

   "options"
   "set_options"
    The options passed to "new".

   "dll"
   "set_dll"
    Our arguments converted to a doubly linked list. (is a
    Getopt::LL::DLList object).

   "result"
   "set_result"
    The final argument hash.

   "leftovers"
   "set_leftovers"
    Array of items in the argument list that does not start with - or --.

  INSTANCE METHODS
   "parseoption($argument, $node)"
    This method is called for each argument to decide what to do with it.

   "find_arg_type($argument)"
    Find out what kind of argument this is.

    If the argument starts with - (a single dash) it returns "short", but if
    it starts with -- (two dashes) it returns "long".

   "is_string($value, $option_name)"
    Check if value is a proper string.

   "is_digit($value, $option_name)"
    Check if value is a digit. ("0-9+") If value starts with -0x-, it is
    treated as a hex value.

   "type_mismatch_error($type, $message)"
    Called whenever a type does not match it's requirements.

   "unknown_argument_error($argument)"
    Called when a argument that has no rule is found. (turn off by setting
    the "allow_unspecified" option to a true value).

   "handle_rule($option_name, $rule, $node)"
    Called when "parseoption()" finds an argument that we have an existing
    rule for. This function decides what to do with the argument based on
    it's "RULE_ACTION".

   "get_next_arg($node)"
    Get and delete the next argument. (Gets the next node in our doubly
    linked list and deletes the current node)

   "peek_next_arg($node)"
    Look at the next argument, but don't delete it.

   "get_prev_arg($node)"
    Get and delete the previous argument.

   "peek_prev_arg($node)"
    Look at the previous argument, but don't delete it.

  "delete_arg($node)"
    Deletes the argument.

  "rules_prepare(\%rules)"
    Find and prepare aliases in the rule set.

  "rules_postactions( )"
    Things to do with rules after argument processing is done. Like adding
    default values for arguments with default values defined and checking
    for required arguments.

  "show_help( )"
    Print help for arguments to standard error. This is experimental and the
    implementation is not exactly complete.

  "show_usage( )"
    Print usage to standard error. This is experimental and the
    implementation is not exactly complete.

  CLASS METHODS
   "getoptions(\%rules, \%options, \@opt_argv)"
    Parses and gets arguments based on the rules in "\%rules". Uses @ARGV if
    "\@opt_arg" is not specified.

    Returns hash with the arguments it found. @ARGV is replaced with the
    arguments that does not start with - or --.

   "opt_String($help_for_option)"
    Shortcut for writing:

         {
             type => 'string',
             help => $help_for_option,
         }

   "opt_Digit($help_for_option)"
    Shortcut for writing:

         {
             type => 'digit',
             help => $help_for_option,
         }

   "opt_Flag($help_for_option)"
    Shortcut for writing:

         {
             type => 'flag',
             help => $help_for_option,
         }

  PRIVATE INSTANCE METHODS
   "_init()"
    Called by new to traverse and parse the doubly linked list of arguments.

   "_warn(@messages)"
    Print a warning on the screen, but only if "$options->{silent}" is not
    set.

  PRIVATE CLASS METHODS
   "_regex_as_text($regex)"
    Quoted regexes are not very user-friendly to print directly, so this
    function turns a quoted regex like:

         (?xmsi:hello)

    into:

         /hello/xmsii
