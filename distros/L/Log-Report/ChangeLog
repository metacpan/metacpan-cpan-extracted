	- add Log::Report::needs() for convenience

version 0.20: Thu Dec 11 14:18:15 CET 2008

	Fixes:

	- changing the run-mode will change the accepted reasons as
	  well, because it was too complex to understand.

	Improvements:

	- complain if syntax option has an invalid value.

	- use warnings and strict in Win32Locale [cpants]

	  because Perl produces horrible complaints for some releases of
	  Perl.

	  setlocale() does not work

	  'POSIX'.

	- added Log::Report::Win32Locale, with experimental application
	  in Log::Report::Lexicon::Index

	- on some platforms, LC_MESSAGES is not defined.  Work-around
	  in Log::Report::Translator::POT.

version 0.11: Thu Oct 18 09:34:18 CEST 2007

	Fixes:

	- Running tests, a temporary directory remained in /tmp.
	  [Andreas Koenig]

	Improvements:

	- Makefile.PL use 5.008 i.s.o. 5.8.2, otherwise not understood
	  by perl 5.5. [Slaven Rezic]

	- Added versions of optional modules to test output

version 0.10: Mon Oct 15 17:55:44 CEST 2007

	Changes:

	- WARNINGs should not included $!... use alert if you are
	  tempted.

	Improvements:

	- few doc fixes.

version 0.09: Thu Aug  9 22:46:56 CEST 2007

	Changes:

	- a try{} block executes eval in the correct context, and
	  returns its results.  Just like eval() does.

	- a non-translated message MUST be only one string to be
	  passed to report(), because other parameters are passed
	  to the message constructor.

	Fixes:

	- stack-trace did not remove the trace of the Log::Report
	  internal helpers.

	- if try died indirectly from a nested died try, then that
	  object is not captured in died() itself.

	Improvements:

	- try() catches Perl die/croak/warn as well, and translates them
	  using Log::Report::Die.

	- try() dies if parameter list has odd length (semi-colon forgotten)

	- implementation of exception classes.
	  See Log::Report::(Message|Exception)::inClass

version 0.08: Wed Jul 11 14:09:32 CEST 2007

	Changes:
	- default dispatcher is now named 'default', type PERL

	Improvements:
	- added comments by [Guido Flohr] about use of Locale::gettext
	- NetBSD has locale C and POSIX in lower-case. [cpan-testers]
	- improve handling of undef values during expand
	- added PERL=Log::Report::Dispatcher::Perl

version 0.07: Wed Jun 20 14:01:18 CEST 2007
	Improvements:
	- another attempt to find-out why some platforms report a
	  deep recursion.

version 0.06: Sat Jun  9 10:33:23 CEST 2007
	Improvements:
	- t/51syslog.t compares required version via UNIVERSAL::VERSION
          (cpan-tester David Cantrell)  Other version checks adapted as well.
	- add t/pod.t, which tests produced pods
	- t/01locale.t even smarter, with help of Andreas Koenig

version 0.05: Thu Jun  7 13:18:13 CEST 2007
	Changes:
	- the stderr dispatcher will be opened when there is any
	  file at STDERR, not only a tty.

	Improvements:
	- simplified t/50files.t
	- another attempt to get t/01locale.t correct on all platforms
	- ::Util; locale parser must accept C and POSIX
	- ::Dispatcher; make message output format translatable
	- ::Extract::PPI; report mistake when msgid ends with new-line
	- ::Extract::PPI; mistake when a variable is interpolated in msgid
	- ::Extract::PPI; qq{} msgids will now be detected as well
	- ::Extract::PPI; special characters the "" and qq{} strings with
	  get interpreted (PPI does not do that automatically)
	- ::Extract::PPI: only report the nessecary
	- after a long discussion within Amsterdam.pm about concatenation
          of translated fragments, it was decided to permit it but put
	  some extra warnings in the docs.
	- also warn about __'xx'   meaning   __::xx '
	- updated log-report/nl_NL.po translations
	- configure native_language for a domain
	- untranslated messages will still be formatted according to the
          rules of the native_language
	- translator table setting per domain now integrated with
	  other settings for the domain.
	- ran ispell on the man-pages

version 0.04: Mon Jun  4 11:05:10 CEST 2007
	- removed incorrect doc about "mode TRY", which does not exist.
	- included syslog in "reason" comparison table
	- have Makefile.PL install xgettext-perl
	- t/50file.t needed more work-arounds to pass automated module
	  tests (which go without -t STDERR)
	- attempts to make test-scripts run on various platforms.

version 0.03: Mon May 28 20:16:26 CEST 2007
	- Log::Report::Message without msgid forgot _append.
	- Log::Report::Message must clone at concatenation.
	- remove translations from POT when not referenced anymore, and
	  not translated either.
	- $@ after try will not show the message, because we want people
	  to use reportAll() or reportFatal().
	- dispatchers now have a format_reason, defaulting to LOWERCASE
	  which looks nicer than uppercase.
	- added docs to ::Try
	- reorganized some docs.
	- Log::Report::Util lacked the trailing "1;"
	- fall-back to no translation in case of unknown locale in ::POT
	- test functionality of setlocale, and hopefully fixed things

version 0.02: Mon May 28 00:49:52 CEST 2007
	- added HTML documentation to http://perl.overmeer.net/log-report/
	- added README and Changelog to MANIFEST
	- filters are not defined on the dispatcher object, but under
	  control of Log::Report::report().
	- Log::Report::Message new methods append(), msgid(), and prepend()
	- added Log::Report::Exception and Log::Report::Dispatcher::Try
	- added isValidReason() and isFatal() to Log::Report
	- added Log::Report::Message::untranslated();
	- Log::Report::report() will convert untranslated strings into
	  Log::Report::Message objects internally too.

	- by David Cantrell via cpan-testers:
	  . require at least perl 5.8.2, for POSIX :local_h and because
	    unique was broken before that release.
	  . t/00use.t cannot test LogDispatch and Gettext, because they
	    depend on optional module
	  . t/50file.t failed because no -t STDERR

version 0.01: Fri May 25 12:13:13 CEST 2007
	- initial (quite complete) implementation.
