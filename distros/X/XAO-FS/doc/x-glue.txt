NAME
    XAO::DO::FS::Glue - glue that connects database with classes in XAO::FS

SYNOPSIS
     my $odb=XAO::Objects->new(objname => 'FS::Glue',
                               dbh => $dbh);
     my $global=$odb->fetch('/');

DESCRIPTION
    A reference to the Glue object is what holds together all List and Hash
    objects in your objects database. This is the only place in API where
    you pass database handler.

    It is quite possible that if XAO::OS would ever be implemented on top of
    some non-relational database layer the syntax of Glue's new() methow
    would change too.

    In current implementation Glue also serves as a base class for both List
    and Hash classes and it provides some common methods. You should avoid
    calling them on Glue object (think of them as pure virtual methods in OO
    sense) and in fact you should avoid using glue object for anything but
    connecting to a database and retrieveing root node reference.

    For XAO::Web case initialization of Glue and retrieveing of Global
    object is hidden from developer.

    In theory Glue object should be split into ListGlue and HashGlue because
    now it mixes methods that know data structure inside List and Glue and
    this is not a Right Thing. But on the other side it is easier to keep
    everything that knows about SQL in just one place instead of spreading
    it over a couple of classes. So, do not ever rely on the fact that let's
    say _list_store_object is in Glue - it might move to some class of its
    own later.

PUBLIC METHODS
    new ($%)
        Creates new Glue object and connects it to a database. There should
        be exactly one Glue object per process/per database.

        It is highly recommended that you create a Glue object once
        somewhere at the top of your script, then retrieve root node object
        from it and keep reference for the lifetime of your script. The same
        applies for web scripts, especially under mod_perl - it is
        recommended to keep root node reference between sessions.

        The only required argument is dsn (database source name). It has
        special format - first part is `OS', then driver name, then database
        name and optionally port number, hostname and so on. It is
        recommended to pass user name and password too. Example:

         my $odb=XAO::Objects->new(objname => 'FS::Glue',
                                   dsn => 'OS:MySQL:ostest;hostname=dbserver'
                                   user => 'user',
                                   password => 'pAsSwOrD');

        In order to get objects connected to that database you should call
        new on $odb with the following syntax:

         my $neworder=$odb->new(objname => 'Data::Order');

    collection (%)
        Creates a collection object based on parameters given. Collection is
        similar to List object -- it contains a list of objects having
        something in common. Collection is a read-only object, you can use
        it only to retrieve objects, not to store objects in it.

        Currently the only type of collection supported is the list of all
        objects of the same class. This can be very useful for searching and
        analyzing tasks.

        Example:

         my $orders=$odb->collection(class => 'Data::Order');

         my $sr=$orders->search('date_placed', ge, 12345678);

         my $sum=0;
         foreach my $id (@$sr) {
             $sum+=$orders->get($id)->get('order_total');
         }

    container_key ()
        Works for Hash'es and List's -- returns the name of current object
        in upper level container.

    contents ()
        Alias for values() method.

    destroy ()
        Rough equivalent of:

         foreach my $key ($object->keys()) {
             $object->delete($key);
         }

    disconnect ()
        If you need to explicitly disconnect from the database and you do
        not want to trust perl's garbage collector to do that call this
        method.

        After you call disconnect() nearly all methods on $odb handler will
        throw errors and there is currently no way to re-connect existing
        handler to the database.

    fetch ($)
        Returns an object or a property referred to by the given URI. A URI
        must always start from / currently, relative URIs are not supported.

        This method is in fact the only way to get a reference to the root
        object (formerly /Global):

         my $global=$odb->fetch('/');

        Experimental extension: The following full forms can also be used:

         xaofs://uri/Pages/P123/Hits/H234/name
         xaofs://collection/class/Data::Page/5678/Hits/H234/name

        Both should yield the same result providing that 5678 is a
        Collection (see XAO::DS::FS::Collection) code for P123.

    glue ()
        Returns reference to the Glue object the current object is received
        from.

    objname ()
        Returns relative object name that XAO::Objects would accept.

    objtype ()
        Always returns 'Glue' string for object database handler object.

    reset ()
        Useful to bring glue to a usable state after some unknown software
        used it. If the connection went down it is reconnected. If there is
        an active transaction -- it will be rolled back, if there are locked
        tables -- they will be unlocked.

    scan (@)
        A wrapper for search() method that makes it easier to search in
        large collections of data.

        See XAO::DO::FS::List for details.

    transact_active ()
        Checks if a there is an active transaction at the moment. Can be
        used to avoid starting another one as transactions can't be nested.

        Example:

          $odb->transact_begin unless $odb->transact_active;

    transact_begin ()
        Begins new transaction. If transactions are not supported by the
        underlying driver it does nothing, see transact_can() method.

        If there is already an active transaction an error will be thrown
        and no new transaction will be started. Transactions can't be nested
        and each transact_begin() must be matched by a transact_commit() or
        transact_rollback().

        Automatic transact_rollback() is performed on destroying Glue or
        disconnecting. It is not done automatically on thrown errors, but if
        an error is never caught the transaction will be rolled back
        automatically at the program termination stage when Glue is
        destroyed. Beware of global error catching blocks and do proper
        cleanup if you use them.

        Example:

          $odb->transact_begin;
          try {
              $order->put(order_total => 123.45);
              $order->get('Products')->put($product_obj);
              $odb->transact_commit;
          }
          otherwise {
              my $e=shift;
              $odb->transact_rollback;
              $e->throw;
          };

    transact_can ()
        Returns boolean true if underlying driver supports transactions of
        false otherwise.

        Example:

          $odb->transact_can ||
              throw XAO::E::Sample "Transactions are not supported";

    transact_commit ()
        Commits changes made during the current transaction. If there is no
        current transaction it will throw an error assuming that there was
        an out-of-sync transact_commit() or transact_rollback() somewhere
        before.

        If transactions are not supported the method will do nothing.

    transact_rollback ()
        Rolls back (cancels) changes made during the current transaction. If
        there is no current transaction it will throw an error assuming that
        there was an out-of-sync transact_commit() or transact_rollback()
        somewhere before.

        If transactions are not supported the method will do nothing.

    unlink ($)
        Alias to delete(), which is defined in derived classes - List and
        Hash.

    upper_class ($)
        Returns the upper class name for the given class or undef for
        FS::Global. Will skip lists and return class name of hashes only.

        Will throw an error if there is no description for the given class
        name.

        Example:

            my $base=$odb->upper_class('Data::Order');

    values ()
        Returns list of values for either Hash or List.

    uri ()
        Returns complete URI to either the object itself (if no argument is
        given) or to a property with the given name.

        That URI can then be used to retrieve a property or object using
        $odb->fetch($uri). Be aware, that fetch() is relatively slow method
        and should not be abused.

        Works for both List and Hash objects. For just created object will
        return `undef'.


    Most of the methods of Glue would be considered "protected" in more
    restrictive OO languages. Perl does not impose such limitations and it
    is up to a developer's conscience to avoid using them.

    The following list is here only for reference. Names, arguments and
    functions performed may change from version to version. You should never
    use the following methods in your applications.

    _charset_change (%)
        Upgrades charset information for the given text fields both in
        memory structures AND in the database tables.

    _scale_change (%)
        Changes 'scale' on 'real' type fields. Can go from unscaled REAL to
        a scaled DECIMAL.

    _class_description ()
        Returns hash reference describing fields of the class name given.

    _collection_setup ()
        Sets up collection - base class name, key name and
        class_description.

    _driver ()
        Returns a reference to the driver for both Glue and derived objects.

    _field_description ($)
        Returns the description of the given field.

    _field_default ($;$) {
        Returns default value for the given field for a hash object. Also
        sets 'default' in class description if it is not there -- this might
        happen when old database is used with new FS.

        Optional second argument is for optimization. It should hold field
        description hash reference if it is available in calling context.

    _glue ()
        Returns glue object reference. Makes sense only in derived objects!
        For GLue object itself would throw an error, this is expected
        behavior!

    _hash_list_base_id ()
        Returns unique_id of the hash that contains the list that contains
        the current hash. Used in container_object() method of Hash.

    _hash_list_key_value ()
        Returns what would be returned by container_key() of upper level
        List. Used in container_object().

    _list_search (%)
        Searches for elements in the list and returns a reference to the
        array with object IDs. See search() method in XAO::DO::FS::List for
        more details.

        Works on Collections too.

    _build_search_query (%)
        Builds SQL search query according to search parameters given. See
        List manpage for description. Returns a reference to a hash of the
        following structure, not a string:

         sql          => complete SQL statement
         values       => array of values to be substituted into the SQL query
         classes      => hash with all classes and their aliases
         fields_list  => list of all fiels names
         fields_map   => hash with the map of 'condition field name' => 'sql name'
         distinct     => list of fields to be unique
         order_by     => list of fields to sort on
         post_process => is non-zero if there could be extra rows in the search
                         results because of some condition that could not be
                         expressed adequately in SQL.
         options      => original options from the FS query

    _build_search_field ($$)
        Builds SQL field name including table alias from field path like
        'Specification/value'.

        XXX - Returns array consisting of translated field name, final class
        name, class description and field description.

    _build_search_clause ($$$$$)
        Builds a list of classes used and WHERE clause for the given search
        conditions.

    _list_setup ()
        Sets up list reference fields - relation to upper hash. Makes sense
        only in derived objects.

    check_name ($)
        Checks if the given name is a valid field name to be used in put()
        or get(). Should not be overriden unless you fully understand
        potential effects.

        Valid name must start from a letter and may consist from letters,
        digits and underscore symbol. Length is limited to 30 characters.

        Returns boolean value.

BUGS
    MySQL chops off spaces at the end of text strings and Glue currently
    does not compensate for that.
