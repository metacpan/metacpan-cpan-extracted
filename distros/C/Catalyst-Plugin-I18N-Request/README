DESCRIPTION
    This plugin is designed to work alongside Catalyst::Plugin::I18N in
    order to provide localization / delocalization of request paths and
    request parameter names.

DELOCALIZATION
    Delocalization occurs when a request is first received, before any
    dispatching takes place. Delocalization assumes that there may exist
    paths or parameter names within the request which do not correlate to
    actual names used within the application itself. When functioning
    properly, this plugin will allow users to activate an action called
    'search' using:

        'recherche' (French requests)
        'suche'     (German requests)
         etc...

    This relies on the localize method provided to the application by
    Catalyst::Plugin::I18N. For the above examples to work, the following
    localizations must occur:

        Key                       | Localized text  | Language
        ==========================================================
        PATH_delocalize_recherche | search          | French
        PATH_delocalize_suche     | search          | German

    That is, $c->localize('PATH_delocalize_recherche') must return 'search'.
    A very similar behaviour applies to parameter names within the query
    string. The keys for these delocalizations begin with
    'PARAMETER_delocalize_' instead of 'PATH_delocalize_'.

LOCALIZATION
    Localization involves taking paths and parameter names and replacing
    them with values which make more sense to users speaking the requested
    language. In the above example, 'search' may not look intuitive to
    German users. Out of the box, this plugin allows you to localize these
    values transparently via the standard $c->uri_for and
    $c->request->uri_with methods which are already standard features of the
    Catalyst framework.

    Like delocalization, this functionality depends upon the $c->localize
    method. However, PATH_delocalize_ is replaced with PATH_localize and
    PARAMETER_delocalize_ is replaced with PARAMETER_localize_.

        Key                  | Localized text  | Language
        ==========================================================
        PATH_localize_search | recherche       | French
        PATH_localize_search | suche           | German

METHODS
  setup ( )
    Allows Catalyst::Request to localize the results of calls to uri_with.

  prepare ( )
    Overrides Catalyst's "prepare" method to push the context object to the
    request object.

  uri_for ( $path [, @args ] [, \%query_values ] )
    Calls the native uri_for, but proceeds to localize the resulting path
    and query values.

  localize_uri ( $uri )
    Localizes a URI using the current context.

  localize_path ( $path )
    Localizes all components of the provided path.

  delocalize_path ( $path )
    Delocalizes all components of the provided path.

  transform_parameters ( \%parameters, $transformer )
    Transforms the given parameter names using the given transformer. The
    transformer may be one of the following:

    *   A CODE reference which accepts the context object as the first
        argument and a parameter name as the second argument.

    *   The name of a particular accessor that can be called on the context
        object, accepting a parameter name as the argument.

  localize_parameters ( \%parameters )
    Localizes the keys within a hash of parameters.

  delocalize_parameters ( \%parameters )
    Delocalizes the keys within a hash of parameters.

  prepare_path ( )
    Delocalizes the requested path.

  prepare_parameters ( )
    Delocalizes the requested parameter names.

  localize_path_component ( $delocalized )
    Localizes a component of a path.

  delocalize_path_component ( $localized )
    Delocalizes a component of a path.

  localize_parameter_name ( $delocalized )
    Localizes a parameter name.

  delocalize_parameter_name ( $localized )
    Delocalizes a parameter name.
