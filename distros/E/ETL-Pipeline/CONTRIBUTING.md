New input or output classes may be posted to CPAN independently of ETL-Pipeline.
For example, a new input class might be named `ETL::Pipeline::Input::Fake`.
The distribution would be called **ETL-Pipeline-Input-Fake**. 

Output classes follow the same convention. The module named 
`ETL::Pipeline::Output::Fake` in distribution **ETL-Pipeline-Output-Fake**.

For enhancements and bug fixes to **ETL-Pipeline** itself, I prefer to get pull 
requests rather than patches. Please do pull requests on branches.
