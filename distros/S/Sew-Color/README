Sew-Color version 1.05 
======================

This module Sew::Color provides some routines for converting between Brother and Madeira and others embroidery threads
and the rgb color values. See the man page. It allows you to search color spaces to select a thread from 
an rgb value, and to create certain custom searches. Its easily extensible to other manufacturers. 

One bug has been corrected since 1.04 affectig the sat function, no new threads have been added. 

Changes Since Version 1.00

The brother colors and codes have been overhauled and now seem to be correct. 
Other manufacturers have been added but little testing has been done of the correct ness of the data.
