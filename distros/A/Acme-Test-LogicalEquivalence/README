    Acme::Test::LogicalEquivalence - Test if expressions are logically
    equivalent

VERSION

    version 0.001

SYNOPSIS

        use Test::More;
        use Acme::Test::LogicalEquivalence qw(is_logically_equivalent);
    
        # test two expressions with 2 variables using the special vars $a and $b
        is_logically_equivalent(2, sub { $a && $b }, sub { $b && $a });
    
        # same as above
        is_logically_equivalent(2, sub { $_[0] && $_[1] }, sub { $_[1] && $_[0] });
    
        # you can do as many vars as you like
        is_logically_equivalent(3, sub { $_[0] || ($_[1] && $_[2]) },
                                   sub { ($_[0] || $_[1]) && ($_[0] || $_[2]) });
    
        done_testing;

DESCRIPTION

    Some expressions are "logically equivalent" to other expressions, but
    it may not be easy to tell if one or both of the expressions are
    reasonably complicated. Or maybe you're like many other people and are
    too lazy to go through the effort... Either way, why not let your
    computer prove logical equivalence for you?

FUNCTIONS

 is_logically_equivalent

    Test logical equivalence of two subroutines.

        my $is_equivalent = is_logically_equivalent($numvars, &sub1, &sub2);

    This will execute both of the subroutines one or more times (depending
    on how many variables you specify) with different inputs. The
    subroutines shall be considered logically equivalent if, for all
    combinations of inputs, they both return the same thing.

    Returns true if the subroutines are logically equivalent, false
    otherwise.
