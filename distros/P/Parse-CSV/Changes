	  error <Alexey Lebedeff>
        - Add failing test case for non-ASCII data <Ken Williams>
        - Various docs fixups <Ken Williams>
        - Rename _getline() to getline() and expose it in the docs <Ken Williams>

2.04      2015-07-15 20:48:16 America/Chicago
	- Fixed a regression that resulted in some failures in the
          Parse::CSV::Colnames distribution [Spotted by H.Merijn Brand]
	- Deprecate calling fields()/string() after fetch() [bc5453f]
	- Various doc clarifications/improvements [bddba50]
	- Simplify processing & reduce copying in fetch() [b47286b]

2.03      2015-07-06 00:03:56 America/Chicago
     	- Now accepts embedded newlines in fields.  Previously parsing
          would fail when embedded newlines were encountered. [Ken
          Williams]

	- Now sets 'binary => 1' by default, as recommended by the
          Text::CSV_XS docs.  This also allows multi-line data by
          default. [Ken Williams]
	  
	- The distribution now lives on GitHub, is controlled by
          Dist::Zilla, and this version was released by Ken Williams.
