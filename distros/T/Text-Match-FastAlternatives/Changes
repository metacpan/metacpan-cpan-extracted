Revision history for Perl extension Text::Match::FastAlternatives

0.01  Sun Dec 17 15:45:18 2006
	- original version

0.02  Sat Dec 23 14:05:27 2006
	- fixed incorrect README file

0.03  Sat Dec 23 14:22:36 2006
	- support Perl 5.8.4 (which has no Newxz() macro)

0.04  Sat Jan  6 13:24:45 2007
	- support older C compilers (C89 rather than C99)

0.05  Thu Nov  1 11:39:17 2007
	- new match_at and exact_match methods

1.00  Mon May  5 12:14:45 2008
	- declare dependency on Perl 5.6
	- update documentation for Perl 5.10
	- label this release as 1.00; the code has been stable for ages
	- if you're already using 0.04 or 0.05, there's no need to upgrade

1.01  Sun Aug 31 16:05:05 2008
	- more flexible: now fully supports Unicode
	- uses less memory: many nodes 376 bytes smaller on 32-bit systems
	- fractionally slower in some cases, but hard to measure the difference

1.02  Mon Sep  1 10:16:22 2008
	- fix test suite to work in Perl 5.10
	- an aside: on 64-bit CPUs, 1.01/1.02 are probably faster than 1.00
	- no code changes; if 1.01 works for you, there's no need to upgrade

1.03  Tue Sep  2 10:48:16 2008
	- fix test suite to work in Perl 5.6
	- no code changes; if 1.02 works for you, there's no need to upgrade

1.04  Sun Sep 28 13:10:48 2008
	- fix bug in match_at on Unicode strings
	- use XSLoader instead of DynaLoader; lower overhead
	- fix test suite Unicode bugs under Perl 5.6

1.05  Fri Dec 28 15:24:08 2012
	- new Aho-Corasick matching algorithm; asymptotic time complexity now
	  O(n) rather than O(nm)
	- several subtle speed enhancements
	- adaptive memory reduction, to help performance even further;
	  memory use for cases small enough to be processed by a 32-bit CPU
	  is no bigger when you use a 64-bit Perl, and can now be 4 bytes
	  per key character (or lower) in some cases
	- performance and memory-usage improvements during trie construction
	- bug fix: magical values now correctly supported
	- Perl 5.6 no longer supported
