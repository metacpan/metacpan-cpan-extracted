Math::Fractal::Curve
====================

This module is intended to generate 2-dimensional fractal curves such as
the von Koch curve from simple generator functions.

The fractals are generated by recursively replacing a distance with the
generator. Hence, the starting distance and the generator define such a
fractal curve. Generators describe what a given distance is going to be
replaced with in terms of lengths of the distance.
