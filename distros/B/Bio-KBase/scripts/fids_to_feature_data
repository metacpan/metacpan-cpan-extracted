=head1 fids_to_feature_data





Example:

    fids_to_feature_data [arguments] < input > output

The standard input should be a tab-separated table (i.e., each line
is a tab-separated set of fields).  Normally, the last field in each
line would contain the identifer. If another column contains the identifier
use

    -c N

where N is the column (from 1) that contains the subsystem.

This is a pipe command. The input is taken from the standard input, and the
output is to the standard output.

=head2 Documentation for underlying call

This script is a wrapper for the CDMI-API call fids_to_feature_data. It is documented as follows:

  $return = $obj->fids_to_feature_data($fids)

=over 4

=item Parameter and return types

=begin html

<pre>
$fids is a fids
$return is a reference to a hash where the key is a fid and the value is a feature_data
fids is a reference to a list where each element is a fid
fid is a string
feature_data is a reference to a hash where the following keys are defined:
	feature_id has a value which is a fid
	genome_name has a value which is a string
	feature_function has a value which is a string
	feature_length has a value which is an int
	feature_publications has a value which is a pubrefs
	feature_location has a value which is a location
pubrefs is a reference to a list where each element is a pubref
pubref is a reference to a list containing 3 items:
	0: a string
	1: a string
	2: a string
location is a reference to a list where each element is a region_of_dna
region_of_dna is a reference to a list containing 4 items:
	0: a contig
	1: a begin
	2: a strand
	3: a length
contig is a string
begin is an int
strand is a string
length is an int

=item -c Column

This is used only if the column containing the subsystem is not the last column.

=item -i InputFile    [ use InputFile, rather than stdin ]

=back

=head2 Output Format

The standard output is a tab-delimited file. It consists of the input
file with extra columns added in this order:

=over 4
    
=item feature_id

Feature identifier

=item feature_publications 

List of Pubmed identifiers for publications associated with this feature.

=item genome_name 

Name of the genome this feature is present in.

=item feature_location 

Location string describing the location of this feature in its genome.

=item feature_length 

Length of the DNA sequence of this feature.

=item feature_function

The function currently assigned to this feature.

=back

Input lines that cannot be extended are written to stderr.
