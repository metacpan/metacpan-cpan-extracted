DESCRIPTION
    This module provides a common interface for Media::Info::* modules,
    which you can use to get information about a media file (like video,
    music, etc) using specific backends. Currently the available backends
    include Media::Info::Mplayer, Media::Info::Ffmpeg,
    Media::Info::Mediainfo.

FUNCTIONS
  get_media_info
    Usage:

     get_media_info(%args) -> [status, msg, payload, meta]

    Return information on media file/URL.

    This function is not exported by default, but exportable.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   backend => *str*

        Choose specific backend.

    *   media* => *str*

        Media file/URL.

        Note that not every backend can retrieve URL. At the time of this
        writing, only the Mplayer backend can.

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element (status) is an integer containing HTTP status code (200
    means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second element (msg) is
    a string containing error message, or 'OK' if status is 200. Third
    element (payload) is optional, the actual result. Fourth element (meta)
    is called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information.

    Return value: (any)

SEE ALSO
    Video::Info - This module is first written because I couldn't install
    Video::Info. That module doesn't seem maintained (last release is in
    2003 at the time of this writing), plus I want a per-backend namespace
    organization instead of per-format one, and a simple functional
    interface instead of OO interface.
