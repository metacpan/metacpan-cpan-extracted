NAME
    RT-Extension-NonWatcherRecipients - Note when non-watchers received an
    email which RT redistributed to watchers

DESCRIPTION
    Sometimes email addresses will be added to a thread attached to an RT
    ticket because someone wants someone else to know what's going on.
    However, if that person isn't added as a Watcher on the RT ticket,
    they'll likely miss subsequent correspondence on the thread as RT
    doesn't know about them.

    RT::Extension::NonWatcherRecipients looks for email addresses on
    correspondence that RT doesn't know about and posts a message like this
    so you know someone may need to be added:

        ------------------------------------------------------------------------
           From: "A User" <a-user@example.com>

        The following people received a copy of this email but are not on the ticket.
        You may want to add them before replying:
        https://YourRT.com/Ticket/ModifyPeople.html?id=12345

           Cc: "Non Watcher" <non-watcher@example.com>
        ------------------------------------------------------------------------

    If you want the person to see correspondence, you can click the link and
    add them. If not, you can just ignore the message.

INSTALLATION
    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make install
        May need root permissions

    make initdb
        Only run this the first time you install this module.

        If you run this twice, you may end up with duplicate data in your
        database.

        If you are upgrading this module, check for upgrading instructions
        in case changes need to be made to your database.

    Edit your /opt/rt5/etc/RT_SiteConfig.pm
        If you are using RT 4.2 or greater, add this line:

            Plugin('RT::Extension::NonWatcherRecipients');

        For RT 4.0, add this line:

            Set(@Plugins, qw(RT::Extension::NonWatcherRecipients));

        or add RT::Extension::NonWatcherRecipients to your existing @Plugins
        line.

    Restart your webserver

USAGE
    If you run the make initdb step, a new global template called
    NonWatcherRecipients Admin Correspondence is installed on your system.
    You can then select this template for any scrips that use the standard
    Admin Correspondence template. We recommend the Admin Correspondence
    template because you'll need RT privileges to add the user to the
    ticket.

    You can also add this to existing templates by adding the following to
    any template:

        { RT::Extension::NonWatcherRecipients->FindRecipients(
            Transaction => $Transaction, Ticket => $Ticket ) }

    As described below, this method returns a message which is then inserted
    into your template. Look at the installed template for an example. You
    may also call the method and use the returned string however you'd like.

METHODS
  FindRecipients
    Search headers for recipients not included as watchers on the ticket and
    return a message to insert in the outgoing email to notify participants.

    Takes: (Transaction => $Transaction, Ticket => $Ticket) These are the
    objects provided in the RT template.

    Returns: a message to insert in a template
