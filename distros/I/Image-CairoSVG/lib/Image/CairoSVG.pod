=head1 NAME

Image::CairoSVG - render SVG into a Cairo surface

=head1 SYNOPSIS

This example converts an SVG into a PNG:

    
    use FindBin '$Bin';
    use Cairo;
    use Image::CairoSVG;
    my $cairosvg = Image::CairoSVG->new ();
    my $surface = $cairosvg->render ("$Bin/locust.svg");
    $surface->write_to_png ("$Bin/locust.png");


=begin html 

<p>
This renders the following image:
</p>
<img width="451.271" height="187.542" src='https://fastapi.metacpan.org/source/BKB/Image-CairoSVG-0.11/examples/locust.png'>

=end html

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module renders some kinds of SVG ("Scalable Vector Graphics")
instructions into a Cairo surface.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new

    my $cairosvg = Image::CairoSVG->new ();

The user can supply a Cairo surface:

    my $cairosvg = Image::CairoSVG->new (surface => $surface);

For example,

    my $cairosvg = Image::CairoSVG->new (
        surface => Cairo::ImageSurface->create ('argb32', 100, 100)
    );

The user can also supply a Cairo context:

    my $cairosvg = Image::CairoSVG->new (context => $cr);

If a Cairo context is supplied, the value of C<surface> is ignored,
and the image is drawn using the C<context> value.

For a simple drawing task, use the surface generated by the module,
the return value from L</render>. Only supply a surface if the module
gets the dimensions of your image wrong. Only use a Cairo context if
you want to include the image in some other image or rescale it.

=head2 render

    my $surface = $cairosvg->render ('some.svg');

Draw an SVG file into a Cairo surface. The return value is the surface
drawn into. 

If the user did not supply a context or a surface in L</new>, a new
Cairo::ImageSurface object is generated. If the user supplied a
context with L</new>, the return value is undefined and should be
ignored. If the user supplied a surface with L</new>, the return value
is just that surface.

If the call value is a scalar containing what looks like XML, it is
parsed from the scalar instead.

If the user does not specify a surface, the generated surface returned
by C<render> is based on the attributes of the <svg> element,
specifically either the C<width> and C<height> attributes, or the
width and height specified in the C<viewBox> attribute.

Calling with a scalar containing XML was added in version 0.08.

=head1 DRAWING METHODS

All of these methods take the attributes of the specific element after
which they're named. So, for example, if you have an SVG C<line>
element, you can parse its attributes with an XML parser, then send
the hash of key/value pairs in the attributes to L</line>.

=head2 line

    $cairosvg->line (%attr);

Render an SVG line onto the surface specified by C<$cairosvg>.  Given
SVG input of the form C<< <line > >>, this renders it onto the Cairo
surface.

=head2 path

    $cairosvg->path (%attr);

Given an SVG path element, send its attribute key / value pairs as
C<%attr> to render into the Cairo surface of C<$cairosvg>. This uses
L<Image::SVG::Path> to render the "d" attibute of the path. It also
converts quadratic bezier curves into cubic bezier curves.

=head2 rect

    $cairosvg->rect (%attr);

=head2 ellipse

    $cairosvg->ellipse (%attr);

=head2 circle

    $cairosvg->circle (%attr);

=head2 polygon

    $cairosvg->polygon (%attr);

Draws a polygon based on the C<points> attribute, closing the path.

=head2 polyline

    $cairosvg->polyline (%attr);

The same as L</polygon> except that it doesn't close the path.

=head1 DEPENDENCIES

=over

=item L<Cairo>

Cairo is used for rendering the image.

=item L<Carp>

Carp is used for reporting errors.

=item L<Image::SVG::Path>

Image::SVG::Path is used for parsing the "path" information of the SVG.

=item L<XML::Parser>

XML::Parser is used for parsing SVG files.

=back

=head1 SEE ALSO

=over

=item CairoSVG

L<CairoSVG|http://cairosvg.org/> is a Python SVG renderer in
Cairo. Parts of the code here are based on it.

=back

=head2 Other CPAN modules related to SVG

=over

=item L<Image::SVG::Path>

This is for reading the "d" attribute of SVG paths.

=item L<MarpaX::Languages::SVG::Parser>

This extends the L<Marpa::R2> parser to parse SVG.

=item L<SVG>

This is for generating SVG documents.

=item L<Image::LibRSVG>

Perl extension for a Gnome library called librsvg which converts SVG
to PNG or JPEG, etc. I have not tested this library.

=item L<SVG::Rasterize>

Rasterize SVG content to pixel graphics.

=head1 BUGS

This module is a "least effort" attempt to get the parts of SVG which
the author needs rendered, rendered. It doesn't even pretend to be a
full SVG renderer. So, if you find the module doesn't do some part of
SVG which you want done, please add that to the module, and contribute
your addition to this module via the github repository.

Some parts of the module (specifically the SVG arc drawing code) are

in case it causes legal issues for someone downstream, I'm mentioning
