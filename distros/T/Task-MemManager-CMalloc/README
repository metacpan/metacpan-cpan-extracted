NAME
    Task::MemManager::CMalloc - Allocates buffers using C's malloc

VERSION
    version 0.04

SYNOPSIS
        use Task::MemManager::CMalloc;

        my $buffer = Task::MemManager::CMalloc::malloc(10, 1, 'A');
        my $buffer_address = Task::MemManager::CMalloc::get_buffer_address($buffer);
        Task::MemManager::CMalloc::free($buffer);

DESCRIPTION
    The "Task::MemManager::CMalloc" module provides access to memory
    bufffers allocated using C's malloc function. The buffers are allocated
    immediately, i.e., not using the delayed allocation mechanism one would
    expect from a garden variety (e.g. glibc) malloc implementation. The
    module provides methods to allocate uninitialized, zero initialized or
    custom initialized buffers, access to the buffer's memory address and
    facilities to free the buffer. The module is intended to be used in
    conjunction with the "Task::MemManager" module, and thus it is probably
    best not to use these functions directly.

METHODS
    *   "malloc($num_of_items, $size_of_each_item, $init_value)"

        Allocates a buffer of size "$num_of_items * $size_of_each_item"
        bytes. If $init_value is not defined, the buffer is not initialized.
        If $init_value is the string 'zero', the buffer is zero initialized.
        Otherwise, the buffer is initialized with the value of $init_value
        repeated for the entire buffer. The value returned is processed by
        the "Task::MemManager" module in order to grab the memory address of
        the buffer just generated.

    *   free($buffer)

        Frees the buffer allocated by "malloc".

    *   get_buffer_address($buffer)

        Returns the memory address of the buffer as a Perl scalar.

    *   "consume($external_buffer_ref, $length)"

        Consumes an external buffer, whose address is stored in a scalar
        variable, with the latter passed as a reference to simulate
        pass-by-reference in C). The length of the buffer should be provide.
        The value of the reference to the address of the external buffer is
        then zeroed out to prevent double free from a subsequent call to C's
        free. Internally C's realloc is used to grow/shrink the buffer to
        the desired length, and thus an implicit copy may be made. If
        realloc returns NULL, then a warning is issued that the user should
        not assume that the requested buffer length is correct. Note that
        the $external_buffer should be a valid Perl integer, otherwise the
        consumption will fail.

DIAGNOSTICS
    There are no diagnostics that one can use. The module will die if the
    allocation fails, so you don't have to worry about error handling. If
    you set up the environment variable DEBUG to a non-zero value, then a
    number of sanity checks will be performed, and the module will die with
    an (informative message ?) if something is wrong.

DEPENDENCIES
    The module depends on the "Inline::C" module to compile the C code for
    the memory allocation and deallocation functions.

TODO
    None I can think of, but open to suggestions.
