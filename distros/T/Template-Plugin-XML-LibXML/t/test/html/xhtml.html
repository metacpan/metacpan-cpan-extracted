  <blockquote>
   In every generation there is a chosen one... she alone will stand
   against the vampires, the demons and the forces of darkness. She is
   the slayer.
  </blockquote>
  <p>
   Buffy Summers knows this tale by heart, and no matter
   how hard she tries to be just a "normal girl", she can not escape
   from her destiny.

   Thankfully, she is not alone in her quest to save the world, as she
   has the help of her friends, the hilarious (and surprisingly quite
   effective) evil-fighting team called "<i>The Scooby
   Gang</i>". Together, Buffy &amp; co. will slay their demons,
   survive one apocalypse after another, attend high school and
   college... and above all, understand that growing up can truly be
   Hell sometimes... literally.
