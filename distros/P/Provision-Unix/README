Provision-Unix

Provision::Unix is a suite of provisioning scripts used to create, modify
and destroy accounts on Unix systems. The types of accounts that can be
provisioned are organized by class with each class including a standard
set of operations. All classes support a minimum of the following 
operations: create and destroy.  Additional common operations in many
classes are: modify, suspend, restore.

Classes are organized into general modules which contain the dispatch 
logic for sub-methods within that class. The structure looks
like this:

 Provision::Unix
   |- DNS
   |   |- BIND
   |   |- NicTool
   |   |- tinydns
   |- User
   |   |- Darwin
   |   |- FreeBSD
   |   |- Linux
   |- VirtualOS
   |   |- FreeBSD
   |   |   |- Ezjail
   |   |   |- Jail
   |   |- Linux
   |   |   |- OpenVZ
   |   |   |- Virtuozzo
   |   |   |- Xen
   |   |- Xen
   |- Web
   |   |- Apache
   |   |- lighttpd

There is not yet an API for Provision::Unix but a command line interface exists. In the bin directory are prov_* applications (prov_dns, prov_user, prov_mail, etc) that can be used to provision accounts and services. 

The general classes are dispatchers that send your provision requests to the appropriate modules, based on the environment and settings in provision.conf. Provision::Unix::VirtualOS contains all the general methods for performing operations on virtual private servers. Subclasses contain implementation specific information such as how to provision an VPS for xen, openvz, or freebsd jails. New subclasses can be easily added by following the example of a completed one.
