A user pointed out an error (in his opinion):
  compare_dirs_ok does not work properly on second level directories
  I have not verified that this error occurs

  compare_dirs_ok does not make sure that the first dir has all the
  files that appear in the second.  It should call dir_contains_only_ok.

The same user said that once compare_dirs_ok is fixed, there should
be an option like --exclude in the standard diff.

#-----------------------------------------------------

Functions Schwern suggested which are not implemented yet:

#-----------------------------------------------------

dir_ok( "some/dir", {
        "foo"       => "some/dir/foo would contain this",
        "bar"       => "some/dir/bar would contain this",
        "baz/biff"  => "some/dir/baz/biff would contain this"
 });
# I suggested using undef for the values here to request a check of structure
# only, that is only file names would be examined, not contents.  Yet,
# Schwern had already suggested dir_contains_ok, which is probably more
# directly intelligiable.

#-----------------------------------------------------

find_ok( "some/dir", sub { which will be run against all files in some/dir
                           and returns true if they pass } );
(implemented in 0.16)

#-----------------------------------------------------

I suggested:

dirs_agree("dir1", "dir2")

Schwern suggested a new name for dirs_agree:

compare_dirs_ok instead of dirs_agree (implemented in 0.03)

(I'm extrapolating, he didn't make a direct suggestion, but his earlier
suggestions point to something like this.)

#-----------------------------------------------------

After trying compare_dirs_ok I immediately wanted to be able to exclude
some lines from the comparison.  Namely, in my example, dates were the
only differences.  So, I still wanted the files to count as the same, even
though the dates differed.  That led to:

compare_dirs_filter_ok($dir1, $dir2, \&filter, $name) (implemented in 0.04)

filter is called for all lines of input, it must return the line with
any needed changes.  If the line should be omitted, it should return "".
(implemented in 0.04)

#-----------------------------------------------------

I want compare_filer_ok($file1, $file2, $filter) to work like
compare_dirs_filter but one file at a time
(implemented in 0.06)

#-----------------------------------------------------

The version 0.15 causes a lot of warning being processed by Perl::Critic
so that some style changes may improve further maintainability.
