0.12 Sat May 17 21:57:55 EDT 2014
    - Updated LICENSE file in response to
      https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=73197.
    - Repository established at:
      https://github.com/jkeenan/IO-Capture-Extended.

0.11 Wed Sep  6 21:39:43 EDT 2006
    - Added 'use strict;' to lib/ IO/Capture/Extended/Overview.pm.  No change
      in functionality.

0.10 Tue May 23 22:08:06 EDT 2006
    - Added 'use strict;' and 'use warnings;' to lib/IO/Capture/Extended.pm.
      No change in functionality.  Removed 'Todo' from distribution.

0.09 Fri May 13 22:33:00 EDT 2005
    - MANIFEST in v0.08 lacked t/testlib/_Auxiliary.pm.  Hence, it 
didn't get packed in distribution by 'make dist'.  Hence, when I 
installed distro from CPAN, everything went kaflooey!

0.08 Thu May 12 21:30:00 EDT 2005
    - Correcting flaw in packaging of distribution.

0.07 Wed May 11 21:53:14 EDT 2005
    - Initiated work on IO-Capture-Extended to supersede
IO-Capture-Stdout-Extended and extend functionality to capturing
standard error in addition to standard output.

0.06 Sun Mar 13 17:37:19 EST 2005
    - Corrected one documentation error: 'unchomped' -> 'chomped'.

0.05 Sun Mar 13 17:01:21 EST 2005
    - Corrected logical flaw in all_screen_lines so that print
statements which contain more than one newline character are 
correctly counted as more than one screen line.

0.04 Sun Mar 13 13:37:24 EST 2005
    - Added method all_screen_lines() so that accurate tests of the 
number of lines normally observed by eye on STDOUT can be conducted.  
(Avoids pitfall of multiple 'print' statements per screen line buried 
inside subroutines which print to STDOUT.)  Added appropriate tests.

0.03 Tue Mar  1 14:50:01 EST 2005
    - Following correspondence with Mark Reynolds, co-author and CPAN 
maintainer of IO::Capture, this version is first uploaded to CPAN.
Slight changes to documentation.

0.02 Sun Feb 13 17:02:15 EST 2005
    - Renamed IO::Capture::Stdout::Extended.  Based on suggestions made 
on perl.qa newsgroup and study of IO::Capture documentation, interface 
was revised and made object-oriented.  Tests and documentation 
extensively revised.

0.01 Thu Feb 10 18:37:00 2005
    - original version; created by ExtUtils::ModuleMaker 0.3207
