Devel/SmallProf
===============


The Devel::SmallProf profiler is focused on the time taken for a
program run on a line-by-line basis. It is intended to be as "small"
in terms of impact on the speed and memory usage of the profiled
program as possible and also in terms of being simple to use.


INSTALLATION

Just the usual

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

and should install fine via the CPAN module.


DEPENDENCIES

   Time::Hires will be used if available.
