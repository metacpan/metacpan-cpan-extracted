Variable-Strongly-Typed version 1.1.0

    This modules allow you to strongly type your variables.  Also known
    as the 'no fun' module - it can greatly enhance you code's quality
    and robustness.

    By enforcing types on some (or all) of your variables you will eliminate
    a large class of careless (& not so careless) errors.

    This could also aid an editor or code-browsing tools to verify code 
    correctness without having to execute the script.

    use Variable::Strongly::Typed;

    my $int             :TYPE('int');       # must have an 'int' value
    my $float           :TYPE('float');     # must have a 'float' value
    my $string          :TYPE('string');    # must not be a reference
    my $file            :TYPE('IO::File');  # must be an IO::File
    my @array_of_ints   :TYPE('int');       # Each slot must contain an int
    my %hash_of_floats  :TYPE('float');     # Each value must be a float

    my $int_own_error   :TYPE('int', \&my_own_error_handler);
                                            # Roll my own error handler

    my @array_of_rgb :TYPE(\&red_green_blue); # my enumerated type

    # For subs!!
     sub return_an_int :TYPE('int') {
        # .. do some stuff ..
        return $something;
     }

    # ... and later ...

    $int = 23;          # All is well
    $int = 'howdy!';    # This line will croak with a good error message

    $float = 3.23;              # All is well, nothing to see here
    $float = new XML::Parser;   # croak!

    $array_of_ints[23] = 44;    # Groovy
    $array_of_ints[12] = 'yah'; # croak!

    $hash_of_floats{pi} = 3.14159;      # no problem
    $hash_of_floats{e}  = new IO::File; # croak!

    # Return 1 if this val is RED, BLUE, or GREEN
    #   0 otherwise
    sub red_green_blue {
        local $_ = shift;

        /\A RED \z/xms || /\A BLUE \z/xms || /\A GREEN \z/xms;
    }

    $array_of_my_very_own_types[23] = 99;       # croak!
    $array_of_my_very_own_types[2] = 'BLUE';    # OK!

    $int_own_error = 'lksdklwe';    # The sub 'my_own_error_hanlder'
                                    #   will be #   called with the
                                    #   offending value

    my $got_it = return_an_int();   # Will 'croak' (or call your error
                                    #   function) #   if this sub doesn't
                                    #   return an 'int'
