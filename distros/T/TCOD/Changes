0.008     2021-07-19 20:51:03+01:00 Europe/London

    New:
        - TCOD::CHARMAP_TCOD and TCOD::CHARMAP_CP437 are now in the
          TCOD::Charmap enum to allow for introspection
        - Arguments to `dispatch` from TCOD::Event::Dispatch propagate to
          any overridden event handlers
    Fixes:
        - Honour the documented default value for `vsync` in TCOD::Context
          constructor.
        - Made tests pass in environments without video support
    Changes:
        - TCOD::Context constructor returns undefined on error. Use
          TCOD::get_error to see what happened.

0.007     2021-07-16 19:56:06+01:00 Europe/London

    Fixes:
        - Fixed an issue with the parsing of positional arguments to
          TCOD::Tileset::load_tilesheet

0.006     2021-07-16 19:33:07+01:00 Europe/London

    New:
        - Added TCOD::Line to wrap line functions. This implements the code
          in the tcod.los module in python-tcod
        - Documented the `state` key in MouseMotion events, and added the
          enums needed to read its value.
        - Added `examples/paint.pl` as an example of event dispatch and line
          calculation
    Fixes:
        - The clear_color argument to TCOD::Context is now correctly handled.
        - Documentation tweaks

0.005     2021-07-15 22:38:06+01:00 Europe/London

    New:
        - The TCOD::Tileset::load_tilesheet constructor now accepts named
          parameters.
        - Added TCOD::Context::convert_event and related methods to add
          tile coordinates to an event with pixel coordinates.
    Fixes:
        - Expanded TCOD::Event documentation to include information about
          the individual event types that are generated.
        - Add documentation about the TCOD::Event::Dispatch role.
        - An error in the argument parsing of TCOD::Context has been fixed.
    Changes:
        - The event types returned by the TCOD::Event functions have been
          modified for consistency. Please refer to their documentation
          for their current behaviour.

0.004     2021-07-15 00:00:49+01:00 Europe/London

    New:
        - Added bindings for some additional TCOD::Context methods:
          - new_console
          - recommended_console_size
    Fixes:
        - Added missing documentation for TCOD::Context and TCOD::Tileset
          objects.
    Changes:
        - The new_terminal method for TCOD::Context objects has been
          removed. This is a deprecated method that was implemented in
          error. The candle that burns twice as fast burns twice as bright.
        - Some methods for TCOD::Tileset objects that have only been partially
          implemented have been removed until they are ready for prime-time.

0.003     2021-07-14 22:12:08+01:00 Europe/London

    New:
        - Added TCOD::ColorRGBA used internally in some of the
          new API functions
        - Added TCOD::Event to wrap around SDL2 events. This uses
          an internal set of SDL2 bindings, while we wait for a
          stable release on CPAN
        - Added TCOD::Context and TCOD::Tileset modelled after the
          recommended API in the upstream python-tcod
    Fixes:
        - Fixed the walk method for Path::Dijkstra objects. This
          method, and the related is_empty, are now documented and tested.
    Changes:
        - Imported bundled fonts from python-tcod to replace the
          old ones with licensing issues.
        - The TCOD::Console API has been updated to reflect
          upstream deprecated methods.

          The following methods were removed:
          - hline
          - print_ex
          - print_ex_utf
          - print_frame
          - print_rect
          - print_rect_ex
          - print_rect_ex_utf
          - print_rect_utf
          - print_utf
          - rect
          - set_key_color
          - vline

          The following methods were changed:
          - blit
          - clear
          - print

          The following methods were added
          - draw_frame
          - draw_rect
          - print_box

          Please see the documentation for these methods for more details.

0.002     2021-07-11 16:58:16+01:00 Europe/London
