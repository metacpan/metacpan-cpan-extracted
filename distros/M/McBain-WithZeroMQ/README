NAME
    McBain::WithZeroMQ - Load a McBain API as a ZeroMQ service

SYNOPSIS
            # write your API as you normally would, and create
            # a simple start-up script:

            #!/usr/bin/perl -w

            use warnings;
            use strict;
            use MyAPI -withZeroMQ;

            MyAPI->work('localhost', 5560);

DESCRIPTION
    "McBain::WithZeroMQ" turns your McBain API into a ZeroMQ REP worker,
    making it easy to consume your APIs with ZMQ REQ clients. The generated
    worker code is based on the request-reply worker example
    <http://zguide.zeromq.org/pl:rrworker> in the ZeroMQ guide
    <http://zguide.zeromq.org/page:all>. Note that the ZeroMQ request-reply
    pattern requires a broker. The guide also has examples for a broker
    <http://zguide.zeromq.org/pl:rrbroker> and a client
    <http://zguide.zeromq.org/pl:rrclient>, though two scripts based on
    these examples are also provided with this module - more for example
    than actual usage - see mcbain-zmq-broker and mcbain-zmq-client,
    respectively.

    The workers created by this module receive payloads in JSON format, and
    convert them into the hash-refs your API's methods expect to receive.
    The payload must have a "path" key, which holds the complete path of the
    route/method to invoke (for example, "GET:/math/sum"). Results are sent
    back to the clients in JSON as well. Note that if an API method does not
    return a hash-ref, this runner module will automatically turn it into a
    hash-ref to ensure that conversion into JSON will be possible. The
    created hash-ref will have one key - holding the method's name, with
    whatever was returned from the method as its value. For example, if
    method "GET:/divide" in topic "/math" returns an integer (say 7), then
    the client will get the JSON "{ "GET:/math/divide": 7 }". To avoid, make
    sure your API's methods return hash-refs.

METHODS EXPORTED TO YOUR API
  work( [ $host, $port ] )
    Connects the ZeroMQ worker created by the module to the ZeroMQ broker
    listening at the host and port provided. If none are provided,
    "localhost" and 5560 are used, respectively.

    The method never returns, so that the worker listens for jobs
    continuously.

METHODS REQUIRED BY MCBAIN
    This runner module implements the following methods required by
    "McBain":

  init( )
    Creates the "work( $host, $port )" method for the root topic of the API.

  generate_env( $job )
    Receives the JSON payload and generates "McBain"'s standard env hash-ref
    from it.

  generate_res( $env, $res )
    Converts the result from an API method in JSON. Read the discussion
    under "DESCRIPTION" for more info.

  handle_exception( $err )
    Simply calls "$job->send_fail" to return a job failed status to the
    client.

CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT
