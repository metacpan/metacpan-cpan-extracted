    title: Fearless Leader
    hacks: [patch, perl]
    ---
    name: Damian Conway

    foreach (@hackers) {
        my $quote = $_->{name};
        $quote .= ", the $_->{title},"
          if defined $_->{title};
        $quote .= ", aka '$_->{nickname}',"
          if defined $_->{nickname};
        $quote .= ' hacked ';

=head1 DESCRIPTION

YAML let's you express any Perl data in a very clean and easy to read format.
Inline::YAML lets you put YAML streams directly into your Perl programs
without any extra syntax.

If you need to express a large static data structure in your code, YAML
is a great way to do it. It has a minimum of control characters and
uses indentation for structure. You'll need less quotes, less commas
and less braces.

The YAML streams should begin with '---' in column 1, and end with '...'
in column 1, both of which are proper YAML constructs for starting and
ending a stream. The YAML will return a list equal in length to the number
of '---' lines.

=head1 HOW IT WORKS

Inline::YAML is a simple filter (using Filter::Simple) that turns:

    my $answers =
    ---
    who: You
    what: Chicken Butt
    where: Under There
    ...

into:

    my $answers = YAML::Load <<'...';
    ---
    who: You
    what: Chicken Butt
    where: Under There
    ...
