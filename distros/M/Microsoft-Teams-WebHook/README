SYNOPSIS
    Sample usage to post notifications using Microsoft::Teams::WebHook

DESCRIPTION
    Microsoft::Teams::WebHook

    Set of helpers to send plain or AdaptiveCard notifications

Constructor attributes
  url [required]
    The backend "url" for your Teams webhook

  json [optional]
    This is optional and allow you to provide an alternate JSON object to
    format the output sent to post queries.

    One JSON::MaybeXS with the flavor of your choice. By default "utf8 = 0,
    pretty = 1".

  auto_detect_utf8 [default=true] [optional]
    You can provide a boolean to automatically try to detect utf8 strings
    and enable the utf8 flag.

    This is on by default but you can disable it by using

        my $hook = Slack::WebHook->new( ..., auto_detect_utf8 => 0 );

METHODS
  new( [url => "https://..." ] )
    This is the constructor for Microsoft::Teams::WebHook. You should
    provide the "url" for your webhook. You should visit the official
    Microsoft documentation page
    <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/webhooks-and-
    connectors/how-to/add-incoming-webhook?tabs=dotnet> for information on
    how to create this URL.

  post( $message )
    The post method allows you to post a single message without applying any
    formatting. The return value is the return of HTTP::Tiny::post which is
    one "Hash Ref". The "success" field will be true if the status code is
    2xx.

    The other "post_*" methods format the message contents in AdaptiveCards
    <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/webhooks-and-
    connectors/how-to/connectors-using?tabs=cURL#send-adaptive-cards-using-a
    n-incoming-webhook> whereas this method allows you to send a simple,
    unformatted plaintext message or provide a "HashRef" structure (which
    will be converted to a JSON string) for custom "AdaptiveCards".

  post_ok( $message, [ @list ])
    Post a message to the Teams WebHook URL. There are two methods of
    calling a "post_*" method.

    You may either pass a simple string argument to the function

        Microsoft::Teams::WebHook->new(url => ...)->post_ok( q{posting a simple "ok" text} );

    or you can pass a hash (not a hashref!) with a required "text" key

        Microsoft::Teams::WebHook->new(url => ...)->post_ok(text => q{your notification message});

    Using the latter form, you may also optionally add "title" and
    "text_color" (for "post_ok" only!) keys to set those additional
    parameters in the resulting AdaptiveCard. If "text_color" is specified,
    it must be one of the allowed AdaptiveCard colors (see documentation
    <https://adaptivecards.io/explorer/TextRun.html>) which as of this
    writing are: "default", "dark", "light", "accent", "good", "warning",
    and "attention".

        Microsoft::Teams::WebHook->new(url => ...)->post_ok(
          title      => q{YOUR NOTIFICATION TITLE},
          text       => q{your notification message},
          text_color => 'light'
        );

    "post_ok" defaults to "good" text color if none is given.

    The return value of the "post_*" method is one HTTP::Tiny response, a
    "HashRef" containing the "success" field, which is true on success.

  post_warning( $message, [ @list ])
    Similar to post_ok, but the color used to display the message is
    "warning" and cannot be overridden.

  post_info( $message, [ @list ])
    Similar to post_ok, but the color used to display the message is
    "accent" and cannot be overridden.

  post_error( $message, [ @list ])
    Similar to post_ok, but the color used to display the message is
    "attention" and cannot be overridden.

  post_start( $message, [ @list ])
    Similar to post_ok, but the color used to display the message is
    "accent" and cannot be overridden. Additionally, this method starts a
    timer, which is used by post_end.

  post_warning( $message, [ @list ])
    Similar to post_ok, but the default color used to display the message is
    "good". An additional italicized, "default"-colored line is appended to
    the AdaptiveCard which displays a human-readable format of the elapsed
    time since "post_start" was called.

    If "post_start" was not previously called (or not called since the last
    "post_end") the timer is considered to have no value and the elapsed
    time section will not be added.

CREDITS
    This module is heavily based on the excellent work done on
    Slack::WebHook (and as such intended to be largely drop-in compatible)
