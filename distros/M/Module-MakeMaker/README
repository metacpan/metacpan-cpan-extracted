NAME
    Module::MakeMaker - A New Way to Make Modules

SYNOPSIS
        > mmm
        > vim Mmm.yaml
        > make
        > make test
        > make install
        > make dist

DESCRIPTION
    Module::MakeMaker (MMM) is a new way to make modules. It builds on the
    the old, tried and true method, but automates the repetitive, cumbersome
    and error prone steps involved. It leverages YAML, Makefiles and
    templating, to do the right things you want to do, when they need to be
    done. This means you can apply a simple patch to your module, and then
    run:

        make upload

    and know that all the appropriate actions need will be performed, and if
    they are all successful, your module will be on its way to CPAN, and you
    can move on to your next task.

    MMM bootstraps a module environment from meta information that you
    specify in "MMM.yaml" or "MMM/config.yaml" files. You can spread this
    data over local and general yaml files to eliminate duplication.

    The main difference between MMM and the traditional style is that none
    of the files that you create in your module directory are used in the
    actual distribution. These files are all copied (or templated or
    generated) into a "cpan/" subdirectory and that is the final place for
    testing and building the CPAN distribution.

    You never need to edit the files in the "cpan/" directory. Also you can
    run all the common make commands:

        > make
        > make test
        > make install
        > make dist

    without needing to cd into the "cpan/" directory. The MMM Makefile has
    targets to run these commands from the top level for you.

    To get started, run the "mmm" command in your new or existing module
    directory. It will set up things for you and tell you what you need to
    do next.
