=head2 C<< name >>

The model name.

Model names follow a `model:tag` format. Some examples are `orca-mini:3b-q4_1` and `llama2:70b`. The tag is optional and, if not provided, will default to `latest`. The tag is used to identify a specific version.

    required => 1,
);

=head2 C<< stream >>

If `false` the response will be returned as a single response object, otherwise the response will be streamed as a series of objects.
