High
- document intr_count and wait_modemlines
- spread POD docs out across the module
- export the POSIX names too, MS_* is for optional porting compatibility
- fix AIX hardware flow control (whats wrong with it?)

Medium
- fix lockfile support (maybe using a generic File::Lock routine?)
- create a method to call "new" without a device name (cleaner way to test)
- split up tests so we can do non-device testing (as the default)
- make error handling behavior an option (don't die on device failure)

Low
- add a mechanism to set any modem lines in one function call
