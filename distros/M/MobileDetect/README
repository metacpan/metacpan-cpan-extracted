MobileDetect version 1.21
=========================

Check a given string against the Mobile Detect Library that can be found here: https://github.com/serbanghita/Mobile-Detect
I have prepared a Perl Version, because there is no such thing in perl and i also want to show my support for Mr. Șerban Ghiță
and his fine piece of PHP Software.

This is the Perl Version. You need to setup LWP with HTTPS Support before (needed to regulary update the Mobile_Detect.json file
from github).
