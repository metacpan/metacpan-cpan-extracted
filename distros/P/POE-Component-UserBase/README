--------
Abstract
--------

POE::Component::UserBase manages user authentication tasks for multiple
sessions, and provides a convenient repository for persistent data for each
user. It is used when you need to authenticate users of your POE application.
It currently assumes that users cannot be logged in multiple times, but it
does allow for a single user to exist in multiple domains.

------------
Requirements
------------

This module requires POE.  This requirement is encoded in Makefile.PL.
In addition, it requires Storable to maintain the persistent data.
It can optionally use the DBI module if you wish to authenticate from a
database of some sort.

------------------
Basic Installation
------------------

[Note: This section is written in advance of PoCo::UserBase's
placement on the CPAN.  These steps are wrong, and you will find no
joy following them.  Please read the Manual Installation section
instead.]

POE::Component::UserBase may be installed through the CPAN shell in
the usual CPAN shell manner.  In a modern CPAN shell, this typically is:

  $ perl -MCPAN -e 'install POE::Component::UserBase'

You can also read this README from the CPAN shell:

  $ perl -MCPAN -e shell
  cpan> readme POE::Component::UserBase

And you can install the component from the CPAN prompt as well:

  cpan> install POE::Component::UserBase

-------------------
Manual Installation
-------------------

POE::Component::UserBase can also be installed manually.  The latest
CPAN version can be found at
<ftp://ftp.cpan.org/pub/CPAN/authors/id/J/JG/JGOFF/> or in a
similarly named directory at your favorite CPAN mirror.

Downloading and unpacking the distribution are left as exercises for
the reader.  To build and test it:

  perl Makefile.PL
  make test

A sample program, samples/tutorial-chat.perl, implements a simple IRC-like
server with authentication and persistent nicks. If you would like to see
more details about its operation, edit it and set the DEBUG constant to
any value Perl considers "true".

When you're ready to install the component:

  make install

It should now be ready to use.
