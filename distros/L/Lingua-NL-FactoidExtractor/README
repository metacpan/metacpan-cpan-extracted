Lingua-NL-FactoidExtractor version 1.4
======================================

This module extracts structured facts (factoids) from running text. A factoid is a tuple 
of four elements: subject, verb, object and modifiers, in which the verb has been 
lemmatized and the object and modifier slots may be empty. As input, the factoid 
extractor takes text that has been syntactically parsed with the Dutch parser Alpino. 

INSTALLATION

   perl Makefile.PL

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires the Dutch Alpino-parser. Alpino is available under the 
conditions of the Gnu Lesser General Public License. 
See http://www.let.rug.nl/vannoord/alp/Alpino/

KNOWN ISSUES

If punctuation such as a full stop or a comma is glued to a word in the Alpino 
output then this punctuation also ends up in the factoids extracted from the 
sentence. Work-around is to use a tokenizer that separates punctuation from 
words by whitespace before parsing the sentence.
