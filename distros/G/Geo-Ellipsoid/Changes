    1. Change test for zero flattening to use delta_within instead of delta_ok

0.904 Tue Aug 22 2006
    1. Eliminate tests using points too far away.
    2. Use delta_ok with relative test instead of delta_within for large

1.0 Fri Mar 21 2008
    1. Normalized calculated angle result from _inverse to be
       less than 360.00 using _normalize_input subroutine.
    2. Fixed POD error (extraneous =over)
    3. Add 'use 5.006_00;' statement to abort Perls earlier than 5.6.0

       set_distance_unit methods
    2. Corrected example of at method in documentation
    3. Ensured no test too close to range boundaries (0,360 or -180,180)

    5. Added tests for different distance units and symmetrical output
       ranges.

1.2 Fri Jul 4 2008
    1. Correct bearing tests in 09-bearing.t

1.13 Wed Sep 07 2016
    1. Use OO syntax to make subclassing possible.
