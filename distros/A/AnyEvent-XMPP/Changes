0.4 Sun Feb 15 22:59:38 CET 2009
         - added a $dont_retrieve_vcard to ::Ext::VCard, to
           prevent retrieval when session_ready event comes.
         - implemented support for old-style (tcp port 5223) SSL connections,
           use the old_style_ssl option for ::Connection to enable TLS handshaking
           upon TCP connect.
         - added $message argument to subscription related events. the contents
           comes from the <status> elements in the presence stanza.
         - made special contact for keeping track of the presences of our own
           resources. See ::IM::Roster::get_own_contact() and ::IM::Contact::is_me().
         - minor fixes in ::Ext::MUC.
         - added 'stream_version_override' parameter to ::Connection, mostly
           for testing purposes with ejabberd (to enforce old-jabber-style
           authentication).
         - partially reversed a patch w.r.t. hostname usage for SASL mechanism.
           A flag 'use_host_as_sasl_hostname' is provided for giving the hostname
           to SASL.
         - rewrote AnyEvent::XMPP::Ext::MUC a bit and made the API more sane.
           for example: join_room doesn't take a callback anymore.
         - added more C<disco_feature> methods to the extensions, so that
           they can be registered to an ::Ext::Disco extension to display
           support for certain features.
         - xmpp_datetime_as_timestamp fixed w.r.t. UTC based timestamps.
         - added possibility to override iq_xml events, and documented
           how to overtake handling of message, presence and iq stanzas.
         - added patch from Pedro Melo to give stanzas sent by a ::Component
           the right namespace.
         - added patch from Pedro Melo to fix passing of the host in ::Component.

0.3 Mon Jan 28 23:00:58 CET 2009
         - fixed a bug in disconnect error reporting.
         - fixed bad parameter passing of AnyEvent::XMPP::Client to
           AnyEvent::XMPP::IM::Account, also 'host' is used for overriding
           the destination host now (and not 'domain', as it was in version
           0.2).
         - half fixed RT #42194 (Domain vs. host and GSSAPI),
           passing the hostname specified by 'host' for ::Connection to
           Authen::SASL's client_new method.
         - fixed bug in ::XMPP::Client where remove_account didn't work
           as expected (and set_accounts).

0.2 Sun Dec 28 15:09:25 CET 2008
         - Using the better tested AnyEvent::Handle and
           AnyEvent::Socket for DNS resolution, TCP connect and TLS now.
         - override_host and override_port have been removed.
         - weird DNS SRV handling and comments have been removed.
         - removed blocked_write option and drain function, send_buffer_empty event
           should be used. blocking behaviour should be emulated with send_buffer_empty
           at the toplevel of the program.
         - improved message tracking api in ::IM::Account
         - added added_account/removed_account events to ::Client
         - added set_accounts() function to ::Client
         - removed unneccessary sample (devcl)
         - renamed module from Net::XMPP2 to AnyEvent::XMPP
         - minor additions to ::Ext::Pubsub.

         - NOTICE: This is the last release of this module under the name
                   Net::XMPP2. All further releases will be done under the name
                   AnyEvent::XMPP!
         - applied fixes from git://github.com/melo/net--xmpp2.git

0.13 Tue Apr 15 13:07:02 CEST 2008
         - added a 'send_buffer_empty' event, to be able to wait
           for an empty send buffer. and also the C<drain> method, which
           will block until the send buffer is empty. also added a C<blocking_write>
           option for L<Net::XMPP2::Connection>.
         - added a default handler to L<Net::XMPP2::Parser> which
           recognizes and stores CDATA now correctly, so that it can
           be retrieved from the nodes structure by the C<as_string> method
           of L<Net::XMPP2::Node> correctly.

0.12 Fri Apr 11 16:30:40 CEST 2008
         - API CHANGE: The C<connect> method of L<Net::XMPP2::SimpleConnection>

         - fixed a serious bug in the split_jid regex, and added a test for
           split_jid
         - fixed a few connection error bugs in Net::XMPP2::Client and the
           SimpleConnection class.

0.10 Wed Dec 12 15:38:58 CET 2007
         - implemented conversation/chat session tracking,
           see Net::XMPP2::Client::send_message and
           Net::XMPP2::IM::Account::send_tracked_message.
         - fixed a race condition with the account adding routine
           of Net::XMPP2::Client.
         - also fixed a small bug in stream initiation, Net::XMPP2 now
           sends a xml declaration again.
         - implemented a very old authentication method which makes Net::XMPP2
           now also work with jabberd 1.4.2. See also the
           'disable_old_jabber_authentication' option in Net::XMPP2::Connection
         - fixed cpan bug #29724 (unpacking the tarball on os x works now
           after renaming devcl -> dev_client).

0.09 Sun Sep 16 09:25:25 CEST 2007
         - fixed a small bug important bug in namespace setting when binding

         - fixed glitches in tests
         - added disco_info example
         - updated disco_info example, added data form retrieval in disco_info
         - fixed bug in whitespace ping
         - added character filter functions for filtering out not-allowed XML
           chars before sending them to the server. Even though this might be
           a programmer error and shouldn't probably be handled by Net::XMPP2
           I added it for convenience. Hopefully noone is confused.
         - fixed potential bug in ping extension
         - added a sample bot samples/talkbot
         - fixed small issue in Writer.pm
         - added other sample bot samples/talkbot_channel

           remove all callbacks now and event names are case sensitive now.
         - Net::XMPP2::Client adding already existing accounts
           now updates them.
         - further todo items killed for MUC support
         - implemented mapping of old error codes to the new condition strings
           and the other way around too in Net::XMPP2::Error::Stanza
         - fallback namespace function for simxml() is now enabled all the time,
           now default namespaces are nearly always generated an the namespace of a
           node fallsback to the parent node if none was supplied.
         - increased test timeout to 20 secs and offered an environment variable
           to override it.
         - the XML writer doesn't write a encoding declaration anymore, for the sake
           of XMPP.

0.06 Wed Aug  1 15:53:56 CEST 2007
         - reply_iq_result and reply_iq_error now attach a from attribute themselves.
         - added general instructions for the test suite which also seems to be
           useful to test servers :-)
         - implemented XEP-0092
         - reviewed the message API a bit, take care
         - started implementation of MUC (XEP-0045).

           manually by calling the contact's methods yourself.
         - fixed weirdties with JID prepping
         - removed to attribute from iq auth get
         - implemented iq auth (XEP-0078)

         - typo bugfix in Net::XMPP2::Ext::Registration::submit_form
         - lots of documentation bugfixes and also added some
           more useful examples to the synopsises.
         - fixed a bug with enabling and disabling multiple features

         - now really added support for in band registration (XEP-0077)
         - added support for out of band transfers (XEP-0066)

0.03 Wed Jul 25 12:04:06 CEST 2007
         - fundamentally changed how events work, it's now less
           errorprone for the programmer (you don't have to return
           a true value now all the time and can call $self->unreg_me
           for unregistering a callback).
           Because of this change send_*_hook and contact_did_* events
           have changed their arguments.
         - implemented SAX event generator for easier integration
           with other XML libraries and generation of DOM.
         - added the possibility to completly restore the original
           XML data from a Net::XMPP2::Node.
         - implemented the component protocol to establish a component
           stream with a server.
         - reordered events a bit so that session_ready comes after
           roster retrieval (when it is retrieved)
         - added possibility to set the initial presence priority
           or prevent sending of initial presence
           (see Net::XMPP2::IM::Connection).
         - fixed some minor issue with handling invalid disco results
         - added send_*_hook event hooks for future extensions
           like the entity capabilities to be able to add payload
           to outgoing stanzas

0.02 Wed Jul 11 22:55:56 CEST 2007
         - added iq_xml event
         - added development client example in samples/devcl/
         - added some debugging events: debug_recv, debug_send, send_stanza_data,
           and recv_stanza_xml.
         - the error event now also provides error reporting
           about exceptions (eq. in IQ callbacks, which is certainly
           useful for development!)
         - fixed error in binding-handling in case the bind iq gets a timeout
         - added samples/room_lister* and samples/conference_lister
         - redesigned disco mechanism a bit
