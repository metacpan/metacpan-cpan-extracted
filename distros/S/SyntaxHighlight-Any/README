NAME
    SyntaxHighlight::Any - Common interface for syntax highlighting and
    detecting language in code

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.07 of SyntaxHighlight::Any (from Perl
    distribution SyntaxHighlight-Any), released on 2017-07-10.

SYNOPSIS
     use SyntaxHighlight::Any qw(highlight_string detect_language);

     my $str = <<'EOT';
     while (<>) {
         $lines++;
         $nonblanks++ if  /\S/;
         $blanks++ unless /\S/;
     }
     EOT
     say highlight_string($str, {lang=>"perl"});
     my @lang = detect_language($str); # => ("perl")

DESCRIPTION
    CAVEAT: EARLY DEVELOPMENT MODULE. SOME FUNCTIONS NOT YET IMPLEMENTED.
    HELP ON ADDING BACKENDS APPRECIATED.

    This module provides a common interface for syntax highlighting and
    detecting programming language in code.

BACKENDS
    Currently, the distribution does not pull the backends as dependencies.
    Please make sure you install desired backends.

FUNCTIONS
  detect_language($code, \%opts) => LIST
    CURRENTLY NOT YET IMPLEMENTED.

    Attempt to detect programming language of $code and return zero or more
    possible candidates. Return empty list if cannot detect. Die on error
    (e.g. no backends available or unexpected output from backend).

    %opts is optional. Known options:

  highlight_string($code, \%opts) => STR
    Syntax-highlight $code and return the highlighted string. Will choose an
    appropriate and available backend which is capable of formatting code in
    the specified/detected language and to the specified output. Die on
    error (e.g. unexpected output from backend).

    Will return $code as-is if no backends are available (a warning is
    produced via Log::Any though).

    By default try to detect whether to output HTML code or ANSI codes (see
    "output" option). By default try to detect language of $code.

    Backends: currently in general tries GNU Source-highlight (via
    Syntax::SourceHighlight, or binary if module not available), then
    Pygments (binary). Patches for detecting/using other backends are
    welcome.

    %opts is optional. Known options:

    *   lang => STR

        Tell the function what programming language $code should be regarded
        as. The list of known languages can be retrieved using
        "list_languages()".

        If unspecified, the function will perform the following. For
        backends which can detect the language, this function will just give
        $code to the backend for it to figure out the language. For backends
        which cannot detect the language, this function will first call
        "detect_language()".

        NOTE: SINCE detect_language() is not implemented yet, please specify
        this.>

    *   output => STR

        Either "ansi", in which syntax-highlighting is done with ANSI escape
        color codes, or "html". If not specified, will try to detect whether
        program is running under terminal (in which case "ansi" is chosen)
        or web environment e.g. under CGI/FastCGI, mod_perl, or Plack (in
        which case "html" is chosen). If detection fails, "ansi" is chosen.

  list_languages() => LIST
    List known languages.

BUGS
    Please report any bugs or feature requests on the bugtracker website
    <https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Dist/Display.html?Name=SyntaxHighlight-Any>

    When submitting a bug or request, please include a test-file or a patch
    to an existing test-file that illustrates the bug or desired feature.

SEE ALSO
    For syntax-highlighting (as well as encoding/formatting) to JSON,
    there's JSON::Color or Syntax::Highlight::JSON (despite the module name,
    the latter is an encoder, not strictly a string syntax highlighter). For
    YAML there's YAML::Tiny::Color.

    solutions are also mentioned.
