NAME
    SVN::Simple::Hook - Simple Moose/Mouse-based framework for Subversion
    hooks

VERSION
    version 0.312

SYNOPSIS
DESCRIPTION
    This is a collection of roles for Moose and Mouse that help you
    implement Subversion repository hooks by providing simple attribute
    access to relevant parts of the Subversion API. This is a work in
    progress and the interface is extremely unstable at the moment. You have
    been warned!

ATTRIBUTES
  repos_path
    Directory containing the Subversion repository.

  repository
    Subversion repository object. Opened on first call to the accessor.

  author
    Author of the current revision or transaction. Role consumers must
    provide a "_build_author" method to set a default value.

  root
    Subversion root object from the repository. Role consumers must provide
    a "_build_root" method to set a default value.

  paths_changed
    A hash reference where the keys are paths in the "root" and values are
    SVN::Simple::Path_Change objects. Enables hooks to access the changes
    that triggered them.

SEE ALSO
    See SVN::Simple::Hook::PreCommit for an example. This role exists solely
    to be composed into other roles.
