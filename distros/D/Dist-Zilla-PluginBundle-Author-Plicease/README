NAME

    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::Plicease - Dist::Zilla plugin bundle
    used by Plicease

VERSION

    version 2.37

SYNOPSIS

    In your dist.ini:

     [@Author::Plicease]

DESCRIPTION

    This is a Dist::Zilla plugin bundle is a set of my personal
    preferences. You are probably reading this documentation not out of
    choice, but because you have to. Sorry.

    Taking over one of my modules?

      This dist comes with a script in example/unbundle.pl, which will
      extract the @Author::Plicease portion of the dist.ini configuration
      so that you can edit it and make your own. I strongly encourage you
      to do this, as it will help you remove the preferences from the
      essential items.

      Alternatively, you can use the dzil bakeini command to convert a
      distribution using this (or any) bundle to an unbundled version.

    Want to submit a patch for one of my modules?

      Consider using prove -l on the test suite or adding the lib directory
      to PERL5LIB. Save yourself the hassle of dealing with Dist::Zilla at
      all. If there is something wrong with one of the generated files
      (such as Makefile.PL or Build.PL) consider opening a support ticket
      instead. Most other activities relating to the use of Dist::Zilla
      have to do with release testing and uploading to CPAN which is more
      my responsibility than yours.

    Really need to fix some aspect of the build process?

      Or perhaps the module in question is using XS (hint: convert it to
      FFI instead!). If you really do need to fix some aspect of the build
      process then you probably do need to install Dist::Zilla and this
      bundle. If you are having trouble figuring out how it works, then try
      extracting the bundle using the example/unbundle.pl script or dzil
      bakeini technique mentioned above.

    I've only uploaded this to CPAN to assist others who may be working on
    one of my dists. I don't expect anyone to use it for their own
    projects.

    This plugin bundle is mostly equivalent to

     exclude_filename = Makefile.PL
     exclude_filename = Build.PL
     exclude_filename = xt/release/changes.t
     exclude_filename = xt/release/fixme.t
     exclude_match = ^_build/

    Some exceptions:

    MSWin32

      Installing Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Git::* on MSWin32 is a pain so it is
      also not a prereq on that platform, isn't used and as a result
      releasing from MSWin32 is not allowed.

OPTIONS

 installer

    Specify an alternative to [MakeMaker] ([ModuleBuild],
    [ModuleBuildTiny], or [ModuleBuildDatabase] for example).

    If installer is Alien, then any options with the alien_ prefix will be
    passed to Alien (minus the alien_ prefix).

    If installer is ModuleBuild, then any options with the mb_ prefix will
    be passed to ModuleBuild (including the mb_ prefix).

    If you have a inc/My/ModuleBuild.pm file in your dist, then this plugin
    bundle will assume installer is ModuleBuild and mb_class =
    My::ModuleBuild.

 readme_from

    Which file to pull from for the Readme (must be POD format). If not
    specified, then the main module will be used.

 release_tests

    If set to true, then include release tests when building.

 release_tests_skip

    Passed into the Author::Plicease::Tests if release_tests is true.

 travis_status

    if set to true, then include a link to the travis build page in the
    readme.

 appveyor

    if set to a appveyor id, then include a link to the appveyor build page
    in the readme.

 mb_class

    if builder = ModuleBuild, this is the mb_class passed into the
    [ModuleBuild] plugin.

 github_repo

    Set the GitHub repo name to something other than the dist name.

 github_user

    Set the GitHub user name.

 travis_user

    Set the travis user name (defaults to github_user).

 appveyor_user

    Set the appveyor username (defaults to plicease).

 cirrus_user

    Set the cirrus-ci user (defaults to same as travis_user, which itself
    defaults to plicease).

 copy_mb

    Copy Build.PL from the build into the git repository. Exclude them from
    gather.

    This allows other developers to use the dist from the git checkout,
    without needing to install Dist::Zilla and
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::Plicease.

 copy_mm

    Same as copy_mb but for EUMM.

 allow_dirty

    Additional dirty allowed file passed to @Git.

 irc

    IRC discussion URL for x_IRC meta (maybe changed to non x_ meta if/when
    IRC becomes formally supported).

 version_plugin

    Specify an alternative to OurPkgVersion for updating the versions in
    .pm files.

 perl

    Specify a minimum Perl version. If not specified it will be detected.
