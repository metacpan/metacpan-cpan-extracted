0.03	2014-12-06 Miko O'Sullivan <miko@idocs.com>

	- Modified test for parse_chars to normalize newlines.
	  Apparently the way Perl on Windows handles newline is
	  different than what I expected, but as long as it's
	  recognizing newlines and|or carriage returns then the test
	  should pass.

	- Added $parser->extra_tokens_ok(). Removed error code
