Graphics-Asymptote version 0.0.3

This module provides a wrapper around the interpretor for Asymptote, a vector
graphics language.  This is the initial release of the module.

INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

	perl Build.PL
	./Build
	./Build test
	./Build install


DEPENDENCIES

Perl version 5.10 or higher (you need the //= operator).

Also, asy, the Asymptote interpreter.  To install this dependency, go to

  http://asymptote.sourceforge.net/

Note that the Asymptote package distributed with Ubuntu (and probably with
Debian in general) is quite out-of-date and some of the command-line options
that are used in Graphics::Asymptote will give that version of Asymptote
trouble.  Therefore, you would do well to install a newer edition of Asymptote.
