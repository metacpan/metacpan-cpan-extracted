

Note: this release is published as a beta, as it contains no tests
      so far. Nevertheless, it is considered stable as it was used
      in several larger projects.


INTRO

Welcome!

This is the C<PerlPoint::Generator::XML::XHTML> package, providing
two formatters for the generator C<PerlPoint::Generator::XML>:
C<XHTML> produces monolythic, all in one pages containing the
whole document, which C<XHTML::Paged> makes each chapter a new
page.

After successfull installation, you can use these formatters this way:

  pp2tdo -target XML -format XHTML ... yoursource.pp

  pp2tdo -target XML -format XHTML::Paged ... yoursource.pp

As usual with C<pp2tdo>, each formatter brings new options.
Please add C<-help> to a valid C<pp2tdo> call to get a list of all the
options available.


INSTALLATION

Install this package the usual manual way by

unpacking
make test install distclean

Or use C<cpanp> or C<cpan> to install including all prerequisites.


DOCUMENTATION

Each module comes with its own POD documentation. For an introduction on how to use
PerlPoint, please see the manual provided with the C<PerlPoint::Package> distribution.


SUPPPORT
