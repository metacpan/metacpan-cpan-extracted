Should we switch to EU::MM for determining the full path to perl? The problem is that some folks move their perl binary post-installation, but never adjust Config.pm. EU::MM is smart, by accepting a full path in $^X or by searching the user's $PATH for $^X, before resorting to Config.pm. However, if we change apreq2, we should also lobby test-dev to adopt the same solution for Apache::Test. Otherwise our test suite will likely fail, even though the rest of the perl build system will presumably still work.

Drop ExtUtils::XSBuilder as the C API is fairly stable now. The header parsing + xs generation stuff may be too difficult for the community to maintain over ordinary .xs files.

Dump automake, preferably replacing that with more stuff from httpd/apr's build system.

Figure out how and where the apreq_xs_ headers, and typemap file, should be installed.

Write tests for the apache 1.3.x module.

Fix the broken make dependencies, especially in the module and glue subdirs. The libtool workaround (for OSX IIRC) that copies module/.libs to module/t is especially bogus.

.IP "\(bu" 2
Round out the unit tests in library/t. Ideally each API function should have its own tests, and each possible error status should be both tested & documented. Also upgrade these tests to use the Apache::Test framework.

in glue/perl/t/apreq/cgi.t on Win32, printing to the error log hangs if the strings involved are about 10000 in size. This doesn't occur in the env/cgi tests - why?

Why must fprintf(stderr, ...), rather than apr_file_printf(err, ...), be used on Win32 in cgi_log() of src/apreq_env.c?

Get env/ (Apache::Test) tests to work for --with-apache2-src option. Also add a test to configure that prevents simultaneous use of --with-apache2-src and --with-apache2-apxs.

Should we bundle an apr-based 'application/xml' parser? If so, how should we parse the xml data into an apr_table?
