NAME
    Webinject - Perl Module for testing web services

SYNOPSIS
        use Webinject;
        my $webinject = Webinject->new();
        $webinject->engine();

DESCRIPTION
    WebInject is a free tool for automated testing of web applications and
    web services. It can be used to test individual system components that
    have HTTP interfaces (JSP, ASP, CGI, PHP, AJAX, Servlets, HTML Forms,
    XML/SOAP Web Services, REST, etc), and can be used as a test harness to
    create a suite of [HTTP level] automated functional, acceptance, and
    regression tests. A test harness allows you to run many test cases and
    collect/report your results. WebInject offers real-time results display
    and may also be used for monitoring system response times.

CONSTRUCTOR
  new ( [ARGS] )
    Creates an "Webinject" object.

    reporttype
        possible values are 'standard', 'nagios', 'nagios2', 'mrtg' or
        'external:'

    nooutput
        suppress all output to STDOUT, create only logilfes

    break_on_errors
        stop after the first testcase fails, otherwise Webinject would go on
        and execute all tests regardless of the previous case.

    timeout
        Default timeout is 180seconds. Timeout starts again for every
        testcase.

    useragent
        Set the useragent used in HTTP requests. Default is 'Webinject'.

    max_redirect
        Set maximum number of HTTP redirects. Default is 0.

    proxy
        Sets a proxy which is then used for http and https requests.

         ex.: http://proxy.company.net:3128

        with authentication:

         ex.: http://user:password@proxy.company.net:3128

    output_dir
        Output directory where all logfiles will go to. Defaults to current
        directory.

    globalhttplog
        Can be 'yes' or 'onfail'. Will log the http request and response to
        a http.log file.

    httpauth
        Provides credentials for webserver authentications. The format is:

          ['servername', 'portnumber', 'realm-name', 'username', 'password']

    baseurl
        the value can be used as {BASEURL} in the test cases

    baseurl1
        the value can be used as {BASEURL1} in the test cases

    baseurl2
        the value can be used as {BASEURL2} in the test cases

    standaloneplot
        can be "on" or "off". Default is off. Create gnuplot graphs when
        enabled.

    graphtype
        Defaults to 'lines'

    gnuplot
        Defines the path to your gnuplot binary.

METHODS
  engine
    start the engine of webinject

TEST CASES
  Parameters
    addcookie
        When added to a test case, this adds a cookie to the cookie jar
        prior to the test case request being sent (i.e. the test case this
        is attached to will include any cookies specified in this
        parameter). This is useful for cases where a cookie is set outside
        of a Set-Cookie directive in the response header. This parameter
        takes a comma-delimited list of fields that configure the cookie;
        the fields for this parameter are a direct one-to-one correllation
        with the parameters to the HTTP::Cookies::set_cookie method. As
        well, multiple cookies can be defined by separating with a '|'
        character as with the addheader parameter.

        The comma-delimited list of fields are as follows.

        addcookie="version,name,value,path,domain,port,path_spec,secure,maxa
        ge,discard"

        version - Cookie-spec version number

        name - Cookie name.

        value - Cookie value.

        path - The URL path where the cookie is set.

        domain - The domain under which the cookie is set.

        port - The port on which the cookie is set.

        path_spec - Boolean. Set if the cookie is valid only under 'path' or
        the entire domain.

        secure - Boolean. If true (1), the cookie is only sent over secure
        connections

        maxage - The time in seconds the cookie is valid for.

        discard - Boolean. Do not send in future requests and destroy upon
        the next cookie jar save.

    parseresponse
        Parse a string from the HTTP response for use in subsequent
        requests. This is mostly used for passing Session ID's, but can be
        applied to any case where you need to pass a dynamically generated
        value. It takes the arguments in the format
        "leftboundary|rightboundary", and an optional third argument
        "leftboundary|rightboundary|escape|decode" when you want to force
        escaping of all non-alphanumeric characters (in case there is a
        wrong configuration of Apache server it will push encoded HTML
        characters (&#47; = /, &#58; = :, ... ) to the Webinject and decode
        serve to translate them into normal characters. See the "Session
        Handling and State Management - Parsing Response Data & Embedded
        Session ID's" section of this manual for details and examples on how
        to use this parameter.

        Note: You may need to prepend a backslash before certain reserved
        characters when parsing (sorry that is rather vague).

        Note: Newlines (\n) are also valid boundaries and are useful when
        you need to use the end of the line as a boundary.

        parseresponse1 Additional parameter for response parsing.

        parseresponse2 Additional parameter for response parsing.

        parseresponse3 Additional parameter for response parsing.

        parseresponse4 Additional parameter for response parsing.

        parseresponse5 Additional parameter for response parsing.

EXAMPLE TEST CASE
      <testcases>
        <case
          id             = "1"
          description1   = "Sample Test Case"
          method         = "get"
          url            = "{BASEURL}/test.jsp"
          verifypositive = "All tests succeded"
          warning        = "5"
          critical       = "15"
          label          = "testpage"
          errormessage   = "got error: {PARSERESPONSE}"
        />
      </testcases>

    detailed description about the syntax of testcases can be found on the
    Webinject homepage.
