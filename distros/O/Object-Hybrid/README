INSTALLATION

With Perl 5.10 and later or if Module::Build module is installed, the preferred way to install is (commands issued in unpacked distribution directory):

	perl Build.PL
	./Build
	./Build test
	./Build install

On Windows this variant may work better:

	perl Build.PL
	Build
	Build test
	Build install

With perl 5.8, if Module::Build is not installed:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install

With perl 5.6 you may need to install Test::More and Module::Build prior to installing this module using Build.PL method as described above.

If above do not apply, not desirable or for some reason not work in your case (e.g. perl 5.6), find lib/Object/Hybrid.pm within distribution and manually copy it into your Perl library directory (any of them) under the Object/Hybrid.pm path. Most likely such manual installation will work perfectly.

If necessary, you can even use Object::Hybrid on perls older than 5.6 - for that install module manually (as just described above) and then modify module's source to replace "no warnings" and "our()" pragma with "$^W = 0" and "use vars qw()" respectively.

DEPENDENCIES

Object::Hybrid is a pure Perl module that has no dependencies other then standard modules (perl 5.6 and newer). However, automated installation process requires perl 5.8 and newer, or Test::More and Module::Build installed. Manual installation requires only hands available :)
