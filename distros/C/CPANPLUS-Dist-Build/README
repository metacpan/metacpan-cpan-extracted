SYNOPSIS

        my $build = CPANPLUS::Dist->new(
                                    format  => 'CPANPLUS::Dist::Build',
                                    module  => $modobj,
                                );
    
        $build->prepare;    # runs Build.PL

        $build->install;    # runs build install

DESCRIPTION

    CPANPLUS::Dist::Build is a distribution class for Module::Build related
    modules. Using this package, you can create, install and uninstall perl
    modules. It inherits from CPANPLUS::Dist.

    Normal users won't have to worry about the interface to this module, as
    it functions transparently as a plug-in to CPANPLUS and will just Do
    The Right Thing when it's loaded.

ACCESSORS

    parent()

      Returns the CPANPLUS::Module object that parented this object.

    status()

      Returns the Object::Accessor object that keeps the status for this
      module.

STATUS ACCESSORS

    All accessors can be accessed as follows: $build->status->ACCESSOR

    build_pl ()

      Location of the Build file. Set to 0 explicitly if something went
      wrong.

    build ()

      BOOL indicating if the Build command was successful.

    test ()

      BOOL indicating if the Build test command was successful.

    prepared ()

      BOOL indicating if the prepare call exited successfully This gets set
      after perl Build.PL

    distdir ()

      Full path to the directory in which the prepare call took place, set
      after a call to prepare.

    created ()

      BOOL indicating if the create call exited successfully. This gets set
      after Build and Build test.

    installed ()

      BOOL indicating if the module was installed. This gets set after
      Build install exits successfully.

    uninstalled ()

      BOOL indicating if the module was uninstalled properly.

    _create_args ()

      Storage of the arguments passed to create for this object. Used for
      recursive calls when satisfying prerequisites.

    _install_args ()

      Storage of the arguments passed to install for this object. Used for
      recursive calls when satisfying prerequisites.

METHODS

 $bool = CPANPLUS::Dist::Build->format_available();

    Returns a boolean indicating whether or not you can use this package to
    create and install modules in your environment.

 $bool = $dist->init();

    Sets up the CPANPLUS::Dist::Build object for use. Effectively creates
    all the needed status accessors.

    Called automatically whenever you create a new CPANPLUS::Dist object.

 $bool = $dist->prepare([perl => '/path/to/perl', buildflags =>
 'EXTRA=FLAGS', force => BOOL, verbose => BOOL])

    prepare prepares a distribution, running Build.PL and establishing any
    prerequisites this distribution has.

    The variable PERL5_CPANPLUS_IS_EXECUTING will be set to the full path
    of the Build.PL that is being executed. This enables any code inside
    the Build.PL to know that it is being installed via CPANPLUS.

    After a successful prepare you may call create to create the
    distribution, followed by install to actually install it.

    Returns true on success and false on failure.

 $dist->create([perl => '/path/to/perl', buildflags => 'EXTRA=FLAGS',
 prereq_target => TARGET, force => BOOL, verbose => BOOL, skiptest =>
 BOOL])

    create preps a distribution for installation. This means it will run
    Build and Build test. This will also satisfy any prerequisites the
    module may have.

    If you set skiptest to true, it will skip the Build test stage. If you
    set force to true, it will go over all the stages of the Build process
    again, ignoring any previously cached results. It will also ignore a
    bad return value from Build test and still allow the operation to
    return true.

    Returns true on success and false on failure.

    You may then call $dist->install on the object to actually install it.

 $dist->install([verbose => BOOL, perl => /path/to/perl])

    Actually installs the created dist.

    Returns true on success and false on failure.
