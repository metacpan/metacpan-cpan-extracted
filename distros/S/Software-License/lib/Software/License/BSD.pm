=head1 VERSION

version 0.104007

=head1 PERL VERSION

This module is part of CPAN toolchain, or is treated as such.  As such, it
follows the agreement of the Perl Toolchain Gang to require no newer version
of perl than one released in the last ten years.  This version may change by
agreement of the Toolchain Gang, but for now is governed by the L<Lancaster
Consensus|https://github.com/Perl-Toolchain-Gang/toolchain-site/blob/master/lancaster-consensus.md>
of 2013 and the Lyon Amendment of 2023 (described at the linked-to document).

Although it may work on older versions of perl, no guarantee is made that the
minimum required version will not be increased.  The version may be increased
for any reason, and there is no promise that patches will be accepted to
lower the minimum required perl.
