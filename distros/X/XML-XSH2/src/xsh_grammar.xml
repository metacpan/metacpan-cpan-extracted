      <para>
	&XSH; acts as a command interpreter. Individual commands must
	be separated with a semicolon. 
	In the interactive shell, backslash may be used at the end of a line to
	indicate that a command continues on the next line.
	Output redirection can be used to pipe output of some XSH <xref
	  linkend="command"/> to some external program, or to capture the output
	to a variable. See <xref linkend="Redirection"/> for more info.
      </para>
      <para>
	&XSH; command <xref linkend="help_command"/> provides a complete
	reference, instantly from the command-line:

      <para>
	<literal>help command</literal>
	gives a list of all &XSH; <link linkend="command">commands</link>.
      </para>
      <para>
	<literal>help type</literal> gives a

      </para>
      <para>
	<literal>help topic</literal> followed by

      <para>
	&XSH; is designed as an environment for querying and manipulating XML and
	HTML documents. Use <xref linkend="open_command"/> or <xref
	  linkend="create_command"/> commands to load an XML or HTML
	document from a local file, external URL (such as http:// or ftp://),
	string or pipe. &XSH; can optionally validate the document during parse
	process (see <xref linkend="validation" /> and
	<xref linkend="load_ext_dtd"/>). Parsed documents are stored in memory
	as <ulink url="http://www.w3.org/DOM/">DOM</ulink> trees, that can be
	<link linkend="Navigation">navigated</link> and <link
	  linkend="Manipulation">manipulated</link> with &XSH; commands and XPath
	language, whose names and syntax make working with
	the DOM tree a flavor of working in a UNIX filesystem.
      </para>
      <para>
	A parsed document is usually stored in a variable. 
	&XSH; shares variables
	with the XPath engine, so if e.g. <literal>$doc</literal> is a &XSH;
	variable holding a document (or, more generally any node-set), then
	<literal>$doc//section/title</literal> is an
	XPath expression selecting all <literal>title</literal> 
	subelements of all
	<literal>section</literal> elements within the (sub)tree of $doc.
      </para>
      <para>
	Although &XSH; is able to parse remote documents via
	<literal>http://</literal> or <literal>ftp://</literal>, it is only
	able to save them locally.  To upload a document to a remote server
	(e.g. using FTP) or to store it into a database, use <xref
	  linkend="save_command" /> command with a <literal>--pipe</literal>
	parameter, in connection with an external program able to store
	its standard input (XML) to the desired location. 
	You can also use similar
	parameter with <xref linkend="open_command"/> in order to parse
	documents from standard output of some external program.
      </para>
      <example>
	<title>Store a &XSH; document 
	  on a remote machine using the Secure Shell</title>
	<code>xsh&gt; <userinput> save --pipe "ssh my.remote.org 'cat &gt; test.xml'" $doc</userinput></code>
      </example>

    <section id="Navigation">
      <title>Tree navigation</title>
      <para>
	With &XSH;, it is possible to browse a <link
	linkend="Documents">document tree</link> 
	(XML data represented as a DOM-tree) as if it was a local
        filesystem, except that <link
	linkend="xpath">XPath</link> 
	expressions are used instead of ordinary directory paths.
      </para> 
      <para>
	To mimic the filesystem navigation as closely as
	possible, &XSH; contains several commands named by analogy of
	UNIX filesystem commands, such as <xref linkend="chxpath_command"/>, <xref linkend="list_command"/> and
	<xref linkend="pwd_command"/>.	
      </para>
      <para>The current position in the document tree
	is called the <emphasis>current node</emphasis>. Current node's XPath
	may be queried with <xref
	linkend="pwd_command"/> command.  In the interactive shell, current
	node is also displayed in the command line prompt. 
	(Since there may be
	multiple document trees open at the same time, &XSH; tries to locate a
	variable holding the current document and use it to fully qualify
	current node's XPath in the &XSH; prompt.) Remember, that beside <xref
	linkend="chxpath_command"/> command, current node (and document) is
	also silently changed by <xref
	linkend="open_command"/> command, <xref
	linkend="create_command"/> command and temporarily also by the
	node-list variant of the <xref linkend="foreach"/> loop without
	a loop variable.
      </para>
      <para>XPath expressions are always evaluated in context
	of the current node. Different documents can be accessed
	through variables: <literal>$doc/foo[1]/bar</literal>.</para>
      <example>
	<title>&XSH; shell</title>
	<code>$scratch:/&gt; <userinput>$docA := open &quot;testA.xml&quot;</userinput>

      <title>Tree modification</title>
      <para>
	&XSH; not only provides ways to browse and inspect the DOM tree but also
	many commands to modify its content by various operations,
	such as copying,
	moving, and deleting its nodes as well as creating completely new nodes
	or XML fragments and attaching them to it. It is quite easy to learn
	these commands since their names or aliases mimic their well-known
	filesystem analogies.  On the other hand, many of these commands have
	two versions one of which is prefixed with a letter &quot;x&quot;. This
	&quot;x&quot; stands for &quot;cross&quot;, thus e.g. <xref linkend="xcopy_command" /> should be read as &quot;cross copy&quot;.
	Let's explain the difference on the example of <xref
	  linkend="xcopy_command"/>.</para>
      <para>
	In a copy operation, you have to specify what nodes are to be
	copied and where to, in other words, you have to specify the
	<emphasis>source</emphasis> and the
	<emphasis>target</emphasis>.  &XSH; is very much XPath-based so,
	XPath is used here to specify both of them. However, there
	might be more than one node that satisfies an XPath expression. So,
	the rule of thumb is that the "cross" variant of a
	command places <emphasis>one and every</emphasis> of the source nodes
	to the location of <emphasis>one and every</emphasis> destination
	node, while the plain variant works one-by-one, placing the
	first source node to the first destination, the second source
	node to the second destination, and so on (as long as there
	are both source nodes and destinations left).
      </para>
      <example>
	<code>$scratch/&gt; <userinput>$a := create &quot;&lt;X&gt;&lt;A/&gt;&lt;Y/&gt;&lt;A/&gt;&lt;/X&gt;&quot;;</userinput>
	  $a/&gt; <userinput>$b := create &quot;&lt;X&gt;&lt;B/&gt;&lt;C/&gt;&lt;B/&gt;&lt;C/&gt;&lt;B/&gt;&lt;/X&gt;&quot;;</userinput>
	  $b/&gt; <userinput>xcopy $a//A replace $b//B;</userinput>
	  $b/&gt; <userinput>copy $b//C before $a//A;</userinput>
	  $b/&gt; <userinput>ls $a;</userinput>
	  &lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;utf-8&quot;?&gt;
	  &lt;X&gt;&lt;C/&gt;&lt;A/&gt;&lt;Y/&gt;&lt;C/&gt;&lt;A/&gt;&lt;/X&gt;

	  $b/&gt; <userinput>ls $b;</userinput>
	  &lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;utf-8&quot;?&gt;
	  &lt;X&gt;&lt;A/&gt;&lt;A/&gt;&lt;C/&gt;&lt;A/&gt;&lt;A/&gt;&lt;C/&gt;&lt;A/&gt;&lt;A/&gt;&lt;/X&gt;
	</code>
      </example>
      <para>
	As already indicated by the example, another issue of tree modification
	is the way in which the destination node determines the target
	location. Should the source node be placed before, after, or somewhere
	among the children of the resulting node? Or maybe, should it replace
	it completely? This information has to be given in the
	<xref linkend="loc"/> argument that usually precedes the destination
	XPath.
      </para>
      <para>
	Now, what happens if source and destination nodes are of
	incompatible types? &XSH; tries to avoid this by implicitly
	converting between node types when necessary.  For example, if
	a text, comment, and attribute node is copied into, before or
	after an attribute node, the original value of the
	attribute is replaced, prepended or appended respectively with
	the textual content of the source node. Note however, that
	<emphasis>element nodes are never converted</emphasis> into
	text, attribute or any other textual node.  There
	are many combinations here, so try yourself and see the
	results.
      </para>
      <para>You may even use some more sophisticated way to convert
	between node types, as shown in the following example, where
	an element is first commented out and than again uncommented.
	Note, that the particular approach used for resurrecting the
	commented XML material works only for well-balanced chunks of
	XML.
      </para>
      <example>
	<title>Using string variables to convert between different
	  types of nodes</title>

    </section>
    <section id="Namespaces">
      <title>Namespaces in XML and XPath</title> <para>Namespaces provide a
	simple method for qualifying element and attribute names in
	XML documents.  Namespaces are represented by a namespace URI
	but, since the URI can be very long, element and attribute
	names are associated with a namespace using a namespace prefix
	(see the <ulink url="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml-names/">W3C
	recommendation</ulink> for details). In an XML document, a
	prefix can be associated with a namespace URI using a
	declaration which takes form of special attribute of the form
	<literal>xmlns:prefix="namespace uri"</literal> on an element.
	The scope of the namespace declaration is then the subtree of the
	element carrying the special <literal>xmlns:prefix</literal> attribute (and includes
	attributes of the element). Moreover, a default namespace can
	be declared using just <literal>xmlns="namespace
	uri"</literal>.  In that case all unprefixed element names
	in the scope of such a
	declaration belong to the namespace. 
	An unprefixed element which is not in scope of 
	a default namespace declaration does not belong to any namespace.
	It is recommended not to combine namespaced elements and
	non-namespaced elements in a single document.
	Note that regardless of default
	namespace declarations, unprefixed attributes do not belong to any namespace
	(because they are uniquely determined by their name
	and the namespace and name of the the element which carries them).
      </para>
      <para>&XSH; tries to deal namespace declarations transparently
	(creating them if necessary when nodes are copied between
	different documents or scopes of namespace declarations). 
	Most commands which create new elements or attributes provide
	means to indicate a namespace. In addition, &XSH; provides commands <xref
	linkend="declare_namespace_command"/>, <xref
	linkend="set_namespace_command"/>, <xref
	linkend="change_namespace_uri_command"/>, and <xref
	linkend="change_namespace_prefix_command"/> to
	directly manipulate XML namespace declarations on the current
	node.
      </para>
      <para>
	Since &XSH; is heavily XPath-based, it is important to
	remember that XPath 1.0 maps prefixes to namespaces
	independently of the declarations in the current document. The
	mapping is instead provided via so called XPath context.
	Namespaces can be tested in XPath either using the built-in
	<literal>namespace-uri()</literal> function, but it is more
	convenient to use namespace prefixes associated with namespace
	URIs in the XPath context.  This association is independent of
	the documents to which the XPath expression is applied and can
	be established using the command <xref
	linkend="registerns_command"/>.  Additional, &XSH;
	automatically propagates the namespace association in the
	scope of the current node to the XPath context, so that
	per-document prefixes in the current scope can also be used.
      </para>
      <para>
	IMPORTANT: <ulink url="http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath">XPath 1.0</ulink> has no concept of a default namespace.
	Unprefixed names in XPath only match names which have no
	namespace. So, if the document uses a default namespace,
	it is required to associate a
	non-empty prefix with the default namespace
        via  <xref linkend="registerns_command"/>
	and add that prefix to names in XPath expressions intended to match 
	nodes in the default namespace.
      </para>
      <example>
	<title>Manipulating nodes in XHTML documents</title>
	<code>open "index.xhtml";
$xhtmlns = "http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml";
register-namespace x $xhtmlns;
wrap --namespace $xhtmlns '&lt;font color="blue">' //x:a[@href];
# or 
wrap '&lt;x:font color="blue">' //x:a[@href];</code>
      </example>
      <para>In the preceding example we associate the (typically
	default) namespace of XHTML documents with the prefix
	<literal>x</literal>.  We than use this prefix to match all
	links (<literal>a</literal> elements) in the document.  Note
	that we do not write <literal>@x:href</literal> to match the
	<literal>@href</literal> attribute because unprefixed
	attributes do not belong to the default namespace.  The <xref
	linkend="wrap_command"/> command is used to create new containing
	elements for the nodes matched by the XPath expression. We may
	either specify the namespace of the containing element
	explicitly, using <literal>--namespace</literal> option, or
	implicitly, by using a prefix associated with the namespace in
	the XPath context.  In the latter case, &XSH; chooses a
	suitable prefix declared for the namespace in the document
	scope (in this case the default, i.e. no, prefix), adding a
	new namespace declaration if necessary.

	to enforce a result
	of a certain type (such as a node-list, a string, a number,

	See <xref linkend="exp"/> and

      </para>
    </section>
    <section id="Variables">
      <title>Variables</title>
      <para>
	In &XSH;, like in Perl and XPath, 
	<link linkend="varname">variable names</link> are are prefixed
        with a dollar sign ($). 
        Variables can
        contain arbitrary Perl Scalar (string, number, array
        reference, hash reference or an object reference).  XPath
        objects are transparently mapped to Perl objects via
        XML::LibXML objects. 
        Values can be assigned to variables
        either by simple <link linkend="assign_command">assignments</link> of the form
	<literal>$variable = <xref linkend="exp"/></literal>,
        where the right hand side is an expression, or by command 
        <link linkend="assign_command">assignments</link> of the form
	<literal>$variable := <xref linkend="command"/></literal>,
        where the right hand side is a &XSH; command, or by
	capturing the output of some command with a variable
	redirection of the following form:</para>
      <code>command |&gt; $variable;</code>
      <para>
	&XSH; expressions are evaluated either by XPath
	engine or by Perl (the latter only happens if the entire
	expression is enclosed with braces
	<literal>{...}</literal>), and
	both Perl and XPath can access all &XSH; variables
	transparently (Perl expressions may even assign to them).
      </para>
      <para>
	A simple simple expression consisting of a variable name
        (e.g. <literal>$variable</literal>) is always evaluated by the
        XPath engine and the result is the content of the variable as
        it appears to the XPath data model.  Since in XPath object
        cannot be void (undefined), XPath engine complains, if the
        value of the variable is undefined. On the other hand,
        expressions like <literal>{$variable}</literal> are evaluated by
        Perl, which results in the value of the variable as seen
	by Perl.
      </para>
      <para>
	Variables can also be used as macros for complicated XPath
	expressions. Any occurrence of a substring of the form
	<literal>${variable}</literal> in an XPath expression is
	interpolated to the value of <literal>$variable</literal> (if
	<literal>$variable</literal> contains an object rather than a
	string or number, then the object is cast to string first) before the
	entire expression is evaluated.  So, for example, if
	<literal>${variable}</literal> contains string
	"<literal>chapter[title]</literal>" (without the quotes), then
	the XPath expression
	<literal>//sect1/${variable}/para</literal> interpolates to 
	<literal>//sect1/chapter[title]/para</literal> prior
	to evaluation. 
      </para>
      <para>
	To display the current value of a variable, use either
	<xref linkend="print_command"/>
	or (in case of a global variables - the distinction is discussed below)
	the command <xref linkend="var_command"/>:
      </para>
      <example>
	  <code>xsh&gt; <userinput>$b="my_document";</userinput>
	    xsh&gt; <userinput>$file="${b}s.xml";</userinput>
	    xsh&gt; <userinput>$f := open $file;</userinput>
	    xsh&gt; <userinput>ls //$b[count(descendant::para)&gt;10]</userinput>
	    xsh&gt; <userinput>print $b</userinput>
	    my_document
	    xsh&gt; <userinput>variables</userinput>
            ...
	    $b='my_document';
            ...
	    $file='my_documents.xml';
            ...
	  </code>
	</example>
      <para>
	Variables can also serve as containers for documents and can be used to
	store lists of nodes that result from evaluating an XPath
	expression (a.k.a. XPath node-sets). This is especially useful
	when a sequence of commands is to be performed on some fixed
        set of nodes and repetitive evaluation of the same XPath 
	expression would be lengthy.  XPath
	node-sets are represented by
	<literal>XML::LibXML::NodeList</literal> Perl objects (which
	is simply a array reference blessed to the above class, which
	provides some simple operator overloading). In XPath, by a
	node-set by definition can only contain a single copy of each
	node and the nodes within a node-set are processed in the same
	order as they appear in the XML document. Having XPath
	node-sets represented by a list gives us the advantage of having
	the possibility to process the list in a different order than
	the one implied by the document (which is what happens
	if a variable containing a node-list is evaluated by Perl 
	rather than XPath), see an example below.
      </para>
      <example>
	<code>xsh&gt; <userinput>$creatures = //creature[@status='alive']</userinput>
          # process creatures in the document order: 
	  xsh&gt; <userinput>foreach $creature print @name;</userinput>
          # process creatures in the reverse document order: 
	  xsh&gt; <userinput>foreach { reverse @$creature } print @name;</userinput>
          # append some more nodes to a node-list (using a variant of
	  # a simple assignment)
	  xsh&gt; <userinput>$creatures += //creature[@status='dead'];</userinput>
	  # again, we can process creatures in order implied by the document:
	  xsh&gt; <userinput>foreach $creature print @name;</userinput>
	  # but we can also process first living and then dead creatures,
          # since this is how they are listed in $creature
	  xsh&gt; <userinput>foreach {$creature} print @name;</userinput>
	  # same as the above is
	  xsh&gt; <userinput>foreach {@$creature} print @name;</userinput>
	</code>
      </example>
      <para>
	&XSH; variables are either globally or lexically scoped.
	Global variables need not to be declared (they can be directly
	assigned to), whereas lexical variables must be declared
	using the command <xref linkend="my_command"/>. Global variable
	assignment may also be made temporal for the enclosing block,
	using <xref linkend="local_command"/>.
      </para>
      <example>

      <para>
	Lexical variables are only defined in the scope of current
	block or subroutine. There is no way to refer to a lexical
	variable form outside of the block it was declared in, nor
	from within a nested subroutine call. Of course, lexical
	variables can be referred to from nested blocks or Perl
	expressions (where they behave just like Perl's lexical
	variables).
      </para>
      <para>
	On the other hand, global or localized &XSH; variables are just
	Perl Scalar variables belonging to the
	<literal>XML::XSH2::Map</literal> namespace, which is also the
	default namespace for any Perl code evaluated from &XSH; (so
	there's no need to use this prefix explicitly in Perl expressions,
	unless of course there is a lexical variable in the current
	scope with the same).
      </para>
      <para>Localizing a variable using the <literal>local</literal>
	keyword makes all assignments to it occurring in the enclosing block
	temporary. The variable itself remains global, only its
	original value is restored at the end of the block that localized it.
      </para>
      <para> 
	In all above cases, it is possible to arbitrarily
	intermix &XSH; and Perl assignments:
      </para>
      <example>
	  <code>xsh&gt; <userinput>ls //chapter[1]/title</userinput>
	  &lt;title&gt;Introduction&lt;/title&gt;
	  xsh&gt; <userinput>$a=string(//chapter[1]/title)</userinput>
	  xsh&gt; <userinput>perl { $b="CHAPTER 1: ".uc($a); }</userinput>
	  xsh&gt; <userinput>print $b</userinput>
	  CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION
	</code>
      </example>
      <para>
	Although all &XSH; variables are in fact Perl Scalars, it is
	still possible to store Perl Array or Hash value to a &XSH;
	variable via reference. The following example demonstrates
	using Perl Hashes to collect and print some simple racial
	statistics about the population of Middle-Earth:
      </para>
      <example>
	<code>my $races;
	  foreach a:/middle-earth/creature { 
	  <tab count="1"/>my $race=string(@race);
	  <tab count="1"/>perl { $races->{$race}++ };
	  }
	  print "Middle-Earth Population (race/number of creatures)"
	  print { map "$_/$races->{$_}\n" keys(%$races); };

	Along with XPath, Perl is one of two &XSH; expression languages,
	and borrows &XSH; its great expressive power.
	Perl is a language optimized for scanning arbitrary text
	files, extracting information from those text files, and
	printing reports based on that information. It has built-in
	regular expressions and powerful yet easy to learn 
	data structures (scalars, arrays, hash tables). It's also a

	<title>Calling Perl</title>
	<para>
	  Perl <link linkend="perl_code">expressions or blocks of
	  code</link> can either be used as arguments to any &XSH; command.
	  One of them is 
	  <xref linkend="perl_command"/> command
	  which simply evaluates the given Perl block.
	  Other commands, such as <xref linkend="map_command"/>,
	  even require Perl expression argument and allow

	  Perl expressions may also provide lists of strings to iterate over

	  <xref linkend="while"/> statements.
	</para>
	<para>
	  To prevent conflict between &XSH; internals and the evaluated
	  Perl code, &XSH; runs such code in the context of a special
	  namespace <literal>XML::XSH2::Map</literal>. As described in
	  the section <xref linkend="Variables"/>, &XSH; string
	  variables may be accessed and possibly assigned from Perl
	  code in the most obvious way, since they actually
	  <emphasis>are</emphasis> Perl variables defined in the

	<para>
	  The interaction between &XSH; and Perl actually works the
	  other way round as well, so that you may call back &XSH; from the
	  evaluated Perl code.  For this, Perl function
	  <literal>xsh</literal> is defined in the
	  <literal>XML::XSH2::Map</literal> namespace.  All parameters
	  passed to this function are interpreted as &XSH; commands.</para>
	<para>Moreover, the following Perl helper functions are defined:
	</para>
	<para><literal>xsh(string,....)</literal> - evaluates
	  given string(s) as &XSH; commands.
	</para>
	<para><literal>call(name)</literal> - call a given
	  &XSH; subroutine.
	</para>
	<para><literal>count(string)</literal> - evaluates
	  given string as an XPath expression and returns
	  either literal value of the result (in case of
	  boolean, string and float result type) or
	  number of nodes in a returned node-set.
	</para>
	<para><literal>literal(string|object)</literal> -
	  if passed a string, evaluates it as a &XSH; expression 
	  and returns the literal value of the result;
	  if passed an object, returns literal value of
	  the object.
	  For example,
	  <literal>literal('$doc/expression')</literal> returns the same
	  value as <literal>count('string($doc/expression)')</literal>.
	</para>
	<para>
	  <literal>serialize(string|object)</literal> - 
	  if passed a string, it first evaluates the string
	  as a &XSH; expression to obtain a node-list object. 
	  Then it serializes the object into XML.
	  The resulting string is equal to the output of the &XSH; command <xref
	    linkend="list_command"/> applied on the same expression or object
	  expression only without indentation and folding.
	</para>
	<para>
	  <literal>type(string|object)</literal> - 
	  if passed a string, it first evaluates
	  the string as &XSH; expression to obtain a node-list object.
	  It returns a list of strings representing
	  the types of nodes in the node-list
	  (ordered in the canonical document order).
	  The returned type strings are: 
	  <literal>element</literal>,
	  <literal>attribute</literal>,

	</para>
	<para>
	  <literal>nodelist(string|object,...)</literal> -

	</para>
	<para>
	  <literal>echo(string,...)</literal> - prints
	  given strings on &XSH; output.
	  Note, that in the interactive mode,
	  &XSH; redirects all output to a specific terminal file handle
	  stored in the variable <literal>$OUT</literal>.
	  So, if you for example mean to pipe the result 
	  to a shell command, you should avoid using STDOUT filehandle
	  directly. You may either use the usual <literal>print</literal>
	  without a filehandle, 
	  use the <literal>echo</literal> function,

        <title>Writing your own XPath extension functions in Perl</title>
        <para>
	  &XSH; allows users to extend the set of XPath functions by
	  providing extension functions written in Perl.  This can
	  be achieved using the <xref linkend="registerfunc_command"/>
	  command. The perl code implementing an extension function
	  works as a usual perl routine accepting its arguments in
	  <literal>@_</literal> and returning the result. The
	  following conventions are used:
	</para>
	<para>
	  The arguments passed to the perl implementation by the XPath
	  engine are simple scalars for string, boolean and float
	  argument types and
	  <literal>XML::LibXML::NodeList</literal> objects for node-set
	  argument types. The implementation is
	  responsible for checking the argument number and types. The
	  implementation may use general Perl functions as well as
	  <literal>XML::LibXML</literal>
	  methods to process the arguments and return the result.
	  Documentation for the <literal>XML::LibXML</literal> Perl module
	  can be found for example at <ulink url="http://search.cpan.org/~pajas/XML-LibXML/">http://search.cpan.org/~pajas/XML-LibXML/</ulink>.
	</para>
	<para>
	  Extension functions SHOULD NOT MODIFY the document DOM tree.
	  Doing so could not only confuse the XPath engine but possibly 
	  even result in an critical error (such as segmentation fault).
	  Calling &XSH; commands from extension function implementations
	  is also dangerous and isn't generally recommended.
	</para>
	<para>
	  The extension function implementation must return 
	  a single value, which can be of
	  one of the following types: simple scalar (a number or
	  string), <literal>XML::LibXML::Boolean</literal> object
	  reference (result is a boolean value),
	  <literal>XML::LibXML::Literal</literal> object reference
	  (result is a string), <literal>XML::LibXML::Number</literal>
	  object reference (result is a float),
	  <literal>XML::LibXML::Node</literal> (or derived) object
	  reference (result is a node-set consisting of a single node),
	  or <literal>XML::LibXML::NodeList</literal> (result is a
	  node-set). For convenience, simple (non-blessed) array
	  references consisting of
	  <literal>XML::LibXML::Node</literal> objects can also be

	  XSH2 uses variables of the form <xref linkend="varname"/> 
	  for all kinds of objects, including node-sets
	  (which, if evaluated as Perl expressions, preserve node order).
	  Node-list variables of XSH 1.x have been deprecated.
	</para>
	<code>$var = //foo/bar;                 # node set
	  $var = "hallo world";             # string
	  $var = xsh:new-element("foo");    # node object
	  $var = { ['a','b','c'] };         # Perl array reference

	  XSH2 allows variables to be used in XPath just as they are used in XSLT:
	</para>
	<code>$var = //foo/bar;
	  ls //baz[ . = $var[@test=1]/any ]
	</code>
	    <para>
	  Variable interpolation is still available in XSH2 via ${var},
	  but it's importance is diminished compared to XSH 1.x, 
	  because the XPath engine now evaluates
	  variables directly. Interpolation can still be used for
	  things like "XPath-macros":
	</para>

	    <para>
	  XSH2 equally supports XPath and
	  Perl <link linkend="exp">expressions</link> 
	  (written in braces { ... }).
	  Unfortunately, Perl expressions can't be embedded in XPath 
	  <link linkend="exp">expressions</link>,
	  but one can still use variables as an agent:
	</para>
	<code>perl { use MIME::Base64 };
	  my $encoded = { encode_base64('open sesame') }
	  ls //secret-cave[string(password) = $encoded]
	</code>
	<para>We can, however, use Perl-only expressions complemented with auto-conversion
	      to do things like:</para>
	<code>copy { encode_base64('Pe do mellon a minno!') } replace //secret-cave/password/text();

	  XSH2 deprecates "string" expressions of XSH 1.x.  However,
	  for convenience, some XSH2 commands interpret name-like
	  XPath expressions on certain argument positions as strings
	  (mostly commands that expect file-name or node-name
	  arguments):
	</para>
	<code>insert element my_document into .;
	  insert text "foo" into my_document;
	  
	  $doc := open my_document;         # opens file named "my_document"

	  In XSH2, XML documents
	  have no ID.

	  $doc2 := open "foo2.xml";
	  ls ($doc1//para|$doc2//para);
	  cd $doc1;

	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      XSH2 commands have options and flags instead of many optional (positional) arguments.
	      Options/flags usually have both long forms (like --flag) and equivalent
	      short forms (like :f) (colon is borrowed from Scheme, because dash is reserved for XPath minus).

	    &XSH; can evaluate XPath expressions as defined in W3C
	    recommendation at <ulink
	    url="http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath">http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath</ulink>
	    with only a little limitation on use of syntactically
	    ignorable whitespace. 
	    (Nice interactive XPath tutorials and references
	    can be found at <ulink url="http://www.zvon.org">http://www.zvon.org</ulink>.)

	  <para>
	    In order to allow &XSH; to use white-space as a command
	    argument delimiter (which is far more convenient to type
	    than, say, commas), the use of white-space in XPath is
	    slightly restricted. Thus, in &XSH;, white-space can only occur in
	    those parts of an XPath expression, that are surrounded by
	    either brackets, square brackets, single or double quotes.
	    So, for example, otherwise valid XPath expression like
	  </para>
	  <code>/ foo / bar [ @baz = "bar" ]</code> 
	  <para>
	    should in &XSH; be written as either of
	  </para>
	  <code>/foo/bar[ @baz = "bar" ]</code> 
	  <para>
	    avoiding any white-space outside the square brackets,
	    or completely enclosed in brackets as in
	  </para>
	  <code>( / foo / bar [ @baz = "bar" ] ).</code>
	  <para>
	    &XSH; provides a number of powerful XPath extension
	    functions, listed below and described in separate
	    sections. XPath extension
	    functions by default belong to &XSH; namespace
	    <literal>http://xsh.sourceforge.net/xsh/</literal> with
	    a namespace prefix set to <literal>xsh</literal>. A
	    program may however call the <xref
	    linkend="xpath_extensions_command"/> command to map &XSH;
	    XPath extension functions into the default namespace, so
	    that they may be used directly without any prefix.
	  </para>

	<description>
	  <para>An &XSH; expression can be one of the following constructs:</para>
	  <enumerate>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>
		XPath 1.0 expression with the following restriction: 
		whitespace is only allowed within parts the expression
		enclosed in quotes (literal strings) or brackets (XPath
		has two types of brackets - plain and square). Thus, while
		<literal>/ foo / bar</literal> is a valid XPath expression
		matching element named bar under root element foo, in &XSH; this
		expression must be written as <literal>/foo/bar</literal> or
		<literal>(/ foo / bar)</literal> or
		<literal>(/foo/bar)</literal> etc.
		The reason for this restriction is simple: 
                &XSH;, like most shell
		languages, uses whitespace as argument delimiter so it must
		be able to determine expression boundaries
		(otherwise, <literal>/ bar / foo</literal> could be
		anything between one and four expressions).
	      </para>
	    </listitem>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>
		In certain contexts, usually when a filename or a node
		name is
		expected as an argument, bareword (otherwise XPath) 
		expressions are
		evaluated in a non-standard way: as long as the
		expression contains no whitespace, no brackets of any
		kind, quotes, double-quotes, <literal>$</literal>
		character, nor <literal>@</literal> character, 
		it is treated as a literal
		token which evaluates to itself. 
		This usually happens if a file name or element
		name is expected, but some other commands, like
		<xref linkend="print_command"/>,
		evaluate its arguments in this way. In order to force an
		XPath evaluation in such situations, the entire expression
		should be enclosed with brackets <literal>(...)</literal>.
		For example, with
		<xref linkend="open_command"/> command, <literal>open
		file</literal> or <literal>open "file"</literal> both
		open a file whose name is <literal>file</literal>
		(literally) whereas <literal>open (file)</literal> or
		<literal>open @file</literal> compute the file name
		by evaluating <literal>(file)</literal> or
		<literal>@file</literal> respectively, as XPath
		expressions.
	      </para>
	    </listitem>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>
  		Perl blocks. These are enclosed in braces like: 
		<literal>{ perl-code }</literal>.
		Perl expressions can be used to evaluate more complicated
		things, like complex string expressions, regexp matches,
		perl commands, etc. In short, arbitrary perl.
		Of course, things like <literal>{`ls`}</literal> work
		too, and that's why we don't need to define shell-like backticks
		in &XSH; itself.
	      </para>
	    </listitem>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>
		Result of one &XSH; command can be directly passed as an argument
		to another. This is done using &amp;{ xsh-code } expressions.
		Most &XSH; commands always return <literal>undef</literal> or 1,
		but some do return a value, usually a node-list. Examples of
		such commands are
		<xref linkend="open_command" />, <xref
		  linkend="copy_command"/>, <xref
		  linkend="move_command"/>, <xref
		  linkend="wrap_command"/>, <xref
		  linkend="edit_command"/>, or <xref
		  linkend="xslt_command"/>.
	      </para>
	    </listitem>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>
		Large blocks of literal data can be passed to commands
		via "here document" expressions
		<literal>&lt;&lt;EOF</literal>,
		<literal>&lt;&lt;'EOF'</literal>,
		&lt;&lt;"EOF"<literal></literal>, where
		<literal>EOF</literal> is an arbitrary
		<literal>ID</literal> string.
		<literal>&lt;&lt;EOF</literal> and
		<literal>&lt;&lt;"EOF"</literal> are equivalent, and
		are subject to interpolation of
		<literal>${...}</literal> constructs, where as
		<literal>&lt;&lt;'EOF'</literal> does not. The result
		of evaluation of these three is the literal content
		(with <literal>${...}</literal> possibly interpolated)
		of the script starting at the following line and
		ending at a line containing just
		<literal>EOF</literal>. <literal>&lt;&lt;{EOF}</literal>
		and <literal>&lt;&lt;(EOF)</literal> are implemented
		too, but I'm not sure they are of any use since
		putting the expression in ( ) or { } has the same
		effect.
	      </para>
	    </listitem>
	  </enumerate>
	  <para>
	    XPath expressions (and their filename variant) are subject
	    to interpolation of substrings of the form
	    <literal>${...}</literal> (called interpolators), where
	    <literal>...</literal> can be of several different forms,
	    described below. The interpolation can be suppressed
	    by preceding the <literal>$</literal> sign with a backslash.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    Substrings of the form <literal>${id}</literal> or
	    <literal>${$id}</literal> are interpolated with the
	    value of the variable named <literal>$id</literal>.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    Interpolators of the form
	    <literal>${{</literal> and <literal>}}</literal>
	    evaluate their contents
	    as a Perl expression (in very much the same way as the
	    <xref linkend="perl_command"/> command) and interpolate
	    to the resulting value.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    Interpolators of the form
	    <literal>${(</literal> and <literal>)}</literal>
	    evaluate their contents as an XPath expression and interpolates to
	    a string value of the result.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    Substrings of the form <literal>\${</literal>
	    interpolate to <literal>${</literal>
	    (as a means for escaping <literal>${...}</literal>
	    in an expression).
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    Expressions are evaluated by &XSH; commands themselves, so
	    the exact value an expression evaluates to, is also
	    command-dependent. There are commands that can handle
	    all data types, but some commands expect their arguments to
	    evaluate only to specific kinds of values.
	    As already mentioned above, commands
	    expecting a filename or a node name usually evaluate
	    simple expressions not containing any special characters
	    as literal strings, whereas commands expecting strings
	    evaluate all expressions so that they get a string value
	    (e.g. by converting a node-set to its text content).
	    Similarly, commands expecting a node-set usually convert
	    strings to a small XML fragments, while commands
	    expecting a single document node usually convert
	    node-sets to a document node by taking the owner
	    document of the first element in the node-set.
	  </para>

	    The <xref linkend="exp" /> may be <xref linkend="xpath"/> as well as

	  <para>
	    Define a new &XSH; sub-routine named <xref linkend="subname"/>.
	    The subroutine may require zero or more parameters. 
	    These are declared as a
	    whitespace-separated list of <emphasis>parametric
	    variables</emphasis>. The body of the
	    subroutine is specified as a <xref linkend="block"/>.
	  </para>
	  <para>A sub-routine can be invoked directly by its name
	    followed by its arguments
	    just as any &XSH; command, or indirectly
	    using the <xref linkend="call_command" />
	    command followed by an expression evaluating
	    to the routine name and sub-routine arguments. 
	    Sub-routine arguments can be arbitrary 
	    expressions. These expressions are evaluated
	    <emphasis>prior</emphasis> the sub-routine's code
	    execution and are assigned to the sub-routine's 
	    parametric variables in the respective order.
	    The number of parameter variables in a sub-routine
	    definition and the number of arguments in a call to it
	    must match.
	    Calling a sub-routine with less or more arguments
	    than declared is a run-time error.
	  </para>
	  <para>	    
	    Parametric variables are lexical 
	    variables within the sub-routine body as if they
	    were declared with <xref linkend="my_command" />.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    Note that a subroutine has to be defined before it is
	    first called (in terms of execution -- depending on the structure
	    of the program, the actual definition of the sub-routine
	    must not necessarily precede all references to it).

	    This command acts in a very similar way as

	    and lasts only for the rest of its enclosing
	    <xref linkend="block"/> or subroutine. At the end of the
	    enclosing block or subroutine, the original value
	    is restored. This also reverts any later usual assignments to the
	    variable done occurring before the end of the block.
	    This command may also be used without the assignment part.
	  </para>
	  <para>Note, that the variable itself remains
	    global in the sense that it is still visible to any
	    subroutine called subsequently from the same block.
	    Unlike <xref linkend="my_command"/>

	<description>
	  <para>
	    For each node matching the <xref linkend="xpath"/> argument,
	    this command creates a new element node according to a
	    given <xref linkend="exp"/> (in the same
	    way as <xref linkend="xinsert_command"/> does)
	    which replaces the matching node, and
	    moves the matching node into this newly created element.
	    If namespace <xref linkend="exp"/> is given,
	    the namespace is applied on the created element.
	    The command returns a node-list consisting
	    of the elements created.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    With <literal>--inner</literal> (or <literal>:i</literal>)
	    flag the command 
	    wraps children nodes of the matching node
	    rather than the node it self
	    the following sense:
	    for each matching node
	    a new element node is created,
	    but this time it is placed into 
	    the matching node and 
	    all previous children of the matching node
	    are moved into the newly created node.
	    In this mode, all non-element matching
	    nodes are ignored. This flag cannot be used together
	    with <literal>--while</literal>
	    and <literal>--until</literal>, which we describe next.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    <literal>--while</literal> (<literal>:W</literal>)
	    and/or <literal>--until</literal> (<literal>:U</literal>) 
	    arguments can be provided in order to move a sequence
	    of adjacent siblings following the matching node into
	    the newly created element. In this way the newly created element wraps
	    not just the matching node itself but a range of nodes starting
	    at the matching node and ending either before a first following node matching
	    the expression of <literal>--until</literal>, or
	    before a first following node not matching the expression
	    of <literal>--while</literal>, or at the last sibling if
	    neither of the prior apply. Both these expressions are
	    evaluated in the context of the currently tested sibling and prior to
	    the creation of the wrapping element. The context
	    position for these expressions is 1 at the first sibling
	    following the matching node and increases with each tested
	    sibling; the context size is the number of all
	    siblings following the matching node.
	    It is important to mention that siblings wrapped in this
	    way are excluded from further processing by <xref
	    linkend="wrap_command"/> even if included in the node-list
	    produced by the <xref
	    linkend="xpath"/> argument. This allows to easily wrap
	    certain adjacent elements without worrying about some
	    elements being wrapped multiple times
	    (for example, <literal>wrap :W x y //x</literal> wraps
	    each sequence of adjacent elements <literal>&lt;x></literal> in a <literal>&lt;y></literal>).
	  </para>
	  <para><literal>--skip-whitespace</literal> (<literal>:w</literal>),
	    <literal>--skip-comments</literal> (<literal>:c</literal>), and 
	    <literal>--skip-pi</literal> (<literal>:p</literal>) can be used
	    in combination with <literal>--while</literal> (<literal>:W</literal>)
	    and/or <literal>--until</literal> (<literal>:U</literal>)
	    to skip testing the expressions on white-space text
	    nodes, comments, and/or processing instruction, respectively.
	    Such nodes are only included in the wrapped range if
	    followed by a sibling that is to be wrapped.

	<shortdesc>wrap spans of nodes into elements</shortdesc>
	<description>
	  <para>
	    This command is very similar to <xref linkend="wrap_command"/>
	    command, except that it works on spans of nodes.
	    It wraps spans (i.e. sequence of adjacent nodes between (and including)
	    a start node and an end node) with a new element
	    whose name is specified as the first argument. 
	    Nodes within each span must have the same parent node.
	    The spans to be wrapped are defined
	    by a pair of node-lists in the second and third argument.
	    The first node-list specifies the
	    start node of one or more spans, while
	    the second node-list should contain the corresponding 
	    end nodes.
	    The two node-lists must evaluate to the exactly same number of
	    nodes, otherwise a runtime error is reported.
	    The N'th span is then defined as a span
	    starting on the N'th node in the start node-list
	    and ending at the N'th node in the end node-list.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    All nodes within the spans are removed from
	    the document and placed into the newly generated elements.
	    The wrapping elements are put back into the document tree
	    at the positions previously occupied by the node-spans.</para>
	  <para>
	    The command returns a node-list containing the newly created
	    wrapping elements.
	  </para>
	  <example>
	    <code>xsh $scratch/&gt; $foo := create { "&lt;root&gt;\n&lt;a/&gt;&lt;b/&gt;\n&lt;a/&gt;&lt;b/&gt;\n&lt;a/&gt;&lt;b/&gt;\n&lt;/root&gt;" };

	  </para>
	  <para>
	    For element nodes, the the 2nd argument <xref
	      linkend="exp"/> 
	    should evaluate to something like
	      "&lt;element-name att-name='attvalue' ...&gt;".  The
	      <literal>&lt;</literal> and <literal>&gt;</literal>
	      characters are optional. If no attributes are used, the

	      that in the first case, the quotes are required since
	      the expression contains spaces.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    Attribute nodes use the following syntax:
	    "att-name='attvalue' [...]".
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    For the other types of nodes (text, cdata, comments) the
	    expression should contain the node's literal content. Again,
	    it is necessary to quote all whitespace and special
	    characters as in any expression argument.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    The <xref linkend="loc"/> argument should be one of:
	    <literal>after</literal>, <literal>before</literal>,
	    <literal>into</literal>,
	    <literal>replace</literal>, <literal>append</literal>
	    or <literal>prepend</literal>. See documentation
	    of the <xref linkend="loc"/> argument type for more detail.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    Optionally, for element and attribute nodes,
	    a namespace may be specified with <literal>--namespace</literal>
	    or <literal>:n</literal>. If used, 
	    the expression should evaluate to the desired namespace
	    URI and the name of the element or attribute being inserted 
	    <emphasis>must have a prefix</emphasis>.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    The command returns a node-list consisting of nodes it created.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    Note, that instead of <literal>xinsert</literal>, you can alternatively use 
	    one of <xref linkend="new_attribute_function"/>,
	    <xref linkend="new_cdata_function"/>,

	    This argument is required by all commands that insert
	    nodes to a document in some way to a destination described
	    by an XPath expression. The meaning of the values listed
	    above is supposed be obvious in most cases, however the
	    exact semantics for location argument values depends on
	    types of both the source node and the target node.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    <literal>after/before</literal> place the node right
	    after/before the destination node, except for when the
	    destination node is a document node or one of the source
	    nodes is an attribute: If the destination node is a
	    document node, the source node is attached to the
	    end/beginning of the document (remember: there is no
	    "after/before a document").  If both the source and
	    destination nodes are attributes, then the source node is
	    simply attached to the element containing the destination
	    node (remember: there is no order on attribute nodes). If
	    the destination node is an attribute but the source node
	    is of a different type, then the textual content of the
	    source node is appended to the value of the destination
	    attribute (i.e. in this case after/before act just as
	    append/prepend).
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    <literal>append/prepend</literal> appends/prepends the
	    source node to the destination node. If the destination
	    node can contain other nodes (i.e. it is an element or a
	    document node) then the entire source node is attached to
	    it. In case of other destination node types, the textual
	    content of the source node is appended/prepended to the
	    content of the destination node.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    <literal>into</literal> can also be used to place
	    the source node to the end of an element (in the same way
	    as <literal>append</literal>), to attach an attribute
	    to an element, or, if the destination node is a text node,
	    cdata section, processing-instruction, attribute or comment,
	    to replace its textual content with the textual content of 
	    the source node.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    <literal>replace</literal> replaces the entire destination
	    node with the source node except for the case when the
	    destination node is an attribute and the source node is
	    not. In such a case only the value of the destination
	    attribute is replaced with the textual content of the
	    source node. Note also that document node can never be
	    replaced.

	<description>
	  <para>This command provides very easy way to create
            or modify content of a document.
            It takes two XPath expressions. The first one
	    should be a node location path which specifies the target node,
	    the second is optional and provides new content for the target
            node.
	    If a node matches the first XPath expression, then its content
	    is replaced with the given value. If no node matches, then XSH2 tries
	    to magically extend the current document by adding nodes in order to
            add missing steps of the location path so as to make the expression
	    match a node. This node is then populated with
	    a copy of the content value (either text or, if the content <xref
            linkend="xpath"/> results in a node-list and the target
            node is an element, nodes).

	    Only a limited subset of XPath is currently supported by
	    this command. Namely, the XPath expression must be a
	    location path consisting of a /-separated sequence of one
	    or more location steps and new nodes
	    can only be magically created along the child, sibling, or
	    attribute axes.
	    The node-test part of the expression
	    can neither be a wildcard (<literal>*</literal>,
	    <literal>@*</literal>, <literal>prefix:*</literal>, ...),
	    nor the <literal>node()</literal> function. If a namespace
	    prefix is used, then either the namespace must already be
	    declared in the document or registered with XSH. 
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    Location steps may contain arbitrary predicates (filters), however,
	    only a limited subset is supported for magically created
	    nodes.
	    In particular, if a filter predicate of a location step
	    specifies a position of a node (e.g. with
	    <literal>[4]</literal>, or
	    <literal>[position()&gt;3]</literal>, etc), then the
	    parser tries to automatically create empty siblings nodes
	    until it finally creates one with for which the predicate
	    is true.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    Note, that this command only processes one location step
	    at a time and always picks the first matching node. So,
	    expressions like <literal>/root/a/b</literal> are treated
	    as <literal>/root/a[1]/b[1]</literal>.  This means that an
	    expression <literal>/root/a/b</literal> will magically
	    create element <literal>&lt;b&gt;</literal> in a first
	    matching <literal>&lt;a&gt;</literal> even if some
	    following <literal>&lt;a&gt;</literal> already contains a
	    <literal>&lt;b&gt;</literal>.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    To prevent this, either explicitly state that <literal>b</literal> must
	    exist with e.g. <literal>/root/a[b]/b</literal> or make the corresponding
	    element <literal>&lt;a&gt;</literal> the context
	    node and use a relative location path:
	  </para>
	  <example>
	    <code>for /root/a/b set b 'foo'</code>

	  <para>
	    NOTE: THE SEMANTICS OF COMMAND HAS CHANGED IN 2.1.0
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    This command provides an easy way to transform node's data
	    (content) using arbitrary expression.
	    It takes two arguments: a mapping expression
	    and a node-list.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    First the second argument is evaluated to a node-list.
	    For each of the nodes,
	    the mapping expression is evaluated 
	    and the result is used to replace the original content
	    of the node. 
	    The node is made the context node for the time
	    of evaluation of the mapping expression.
	    Moreover, if the expression is a Perl code,
	    it gets the original text content in 
	    the variable <literal>$_</literal>.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    Note that if the processed node is an element
	    than the mapping expression may even produce nodes
	    which are then copied into the element discarding
	    any previous content of the element.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    If the mapping expression returns an undefined value
	    for a node, then its content is kept untouched.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    <literal>--in-place</literal> (<literal>:i</literal>) flag:
	    if the expression is a Perl code, then
	    it is sometimes convenient to change the value
	    in place. In that case use this flag to indicate that the result
	    should to be taken from the <literal>$_</literal> variable
	    rather than from the value of the expression itself.
	    Without this flag, <literal>$_</literal> is read-only.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    <literal>--reverse</literal> (<literal>:r</literal>) flag
	    instruct the map to process the nodelist
	    in reversed order.
	  </para>
	  <example>
	    <title>Capitalizes all hobbit names</title>
	    <code>map { ucfirst($_) } //hobbit/@name;</code>	  
	  </example>
	  <example>
	    <title>Changes Goblins to Orcs in all hobbit tales (\b matches word boundary).</title>
	    <code>map :i { s/\bgoblin\b/orc/gi } //hobbit/tale/text();</code>
	  </example>
	  <example>
	    <title>Recompute column sums in the last row of row-oriented table</title>
	    <code>map sum(/table/row[position()&lt;last()]/
                            cell[count(xsh:current()/preceding-sibling::cell)+1])
                     /table/row[last()]/cell;</code>
	  </example>
	  <example>
	    <title>The following commands do all about the same:</title>
	    <code>wrap --inner Z //*;
	      map --reverse xsh:parse(concat("&lt;Z>",xsh:serialize(node()),"&lt;/Z>")) //*;
	      map xsh:parse(concat("&lt;Z>",xsh:serialize(node()),"&lt;/Z>")) { reverse xpath('//*') };
	    </code>
	  </example>
	  <para>Note that in the last example we use
	    <literal>:r</literal> (or Perl <literal>reverse</literal>
	    function) to reverse the node list order so that child
	    nodes get processed before their parents. Otherwise, the child
	    nodes would be replaced by parent's new content before the
	    processing could reach them.

	    which is evaluated in the context of each node in turn.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    This takes a given <xref linkend="document" />,

	    to its original file or another file (default),
	    pipes it to an external command,
	    prints it on standard output, or
	    simply returns it. Without arguments
	    it simply saves current document
	    to its original file.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    <literal>--file|:f</literal> option
	    may be used to specify an output file-name.
	    By default, the original document's file-name
	    is used.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    <literal>--pipe|:p</literal> option
	    specifies, that the output should be
	    piped to an external command
	    specified as the option's argument.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    <literal>--print|:r</literal> option
	    specifies, that the output should 
	    be printed on standard output.</para>
	  <para>
	    <literal>--string|:s</literal>
	    option specifies, that the output
	    should be returned by the command
	    as a string. In this case, the result is
	    always in UTF8, regardless on which
	    encoding is specified in the document
	    or using <literal>--encoding</literal> option.
	  </para>
	  <para>The above four options are mutually exclusive.</para>
	  <para>
	    <literal>--format</literal> option may be used
	    to specify the output format. It's argument
	    should be either <literal>xml</literal>,
	    <literal>html</literal> or an expression
	    evaluating to one of these. If not specified,
	    XML output is assumed.
	    Note, that a document should be saved as HTML only if it
	    actually is a HTML document, otherwise the result would be 
	    an invalid XML instance. Note also, that the optional
	    encoding parameter only forces character conversion; it is
	    up to the user to declare the document encoding in the
	    appropriate HTML &lt;META&gt; tag, if needed.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    <literal>--xinclude</literal>
	    automatically implies XML format and
	    can be used to force &XSH; to save all already expanded
	    XInclude sections back to their original files while
	    replacing them with &lt;xi:include&gt; tags in the main
	    XML file. Moreover, all material included within
	    &lt;include&gt; elements from the
	    <ulink url="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude">http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude</ulink>
	    namespace is saved to separate files too according to the
	    <literal>href</literal> attribute, leaving only empty
	    &lt;include&gt; element in the root file. This feature may
	    be used to split the document to a new set of XInclude fragments.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    If the <literal>--subtree</literal> (<literal>:S</literal>)
	    flag is used, only the subtree of the

	    on output, overriding current global setting
	    of <xref linkend="skip_dtd"/>.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    <literal>--empty-tags</literal> (<literal>:t</literal>)
	    and 
	    <literal>--no-empty-tags</literal> (<literal>:T</literal>)
	    may be used to override current global setting
	    of <xref linkend="empty_tags"/>.
	    <literal>--no-empty-tags</literal> instructs &XSH;
	    to serialize elements with no child nodes
	    as start-tag/end-tag pair
	    <literal>&lt;element&gt;&lt;/element&gt;</literal>
	    instead of using a short empty-tag form
	    <literal>&lt;element/&gt;</literal>.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    <literal>--skip-xmldecl</literal> (<literal>:x</literal>)
	    instructs &XSH; to omit the XML declaration
	    from the saved document. Note however, that XML declaration
	    is obligatory for XML documents. It usually looks like
	    <literal>&lt;?xml version="1.0" ...?&gt;</literal>.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    <literal>--backup</literal> (<literal>:b</literal>)
	    and 
	    <literal>--no-backup</literal> (<literal>:B</literal>)
	    can be used to enforce/suppress
	    creation of a backup file if target file
	    already exists. Using these options
	    overrides current global setting of <xref linkend="backups"/>.
	  </para>	  
	  <para>
	    <literal>--encoding</literal>
	     followed by a <xref linkend="enc_string" />
	    instructs &XSH; to save the document in the specified
	    encoding.  In case of XML output, the &lt;?xml?&gt;
	    declaration is automatically changed accordingly.

	<description>
	  <para>
	    Iterate works very much like a <xref
	      linkend="foreach" /> loop with the
	    same <xref linkend="xpath"/> expression, except that it
	    evaluates the <xref linkend="block"/> as soon as a new node
	    matching a given <xref linkend="xpath"/> is found. As a
	    limitation, an <xref linkend="xpath"/> expression
	    used with <literal>iterate</literal> may consist of one XPath
	    step only, i.e. it may not contain an XPath step separator
	    <literal>/</literal>.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    A possible benefit of using <literal>iterate</literal> instead of
	    <xref linkend="foreach" /> is some efficiency when
	    iterating over huge node-sets. Since
	    <literal>iterate</literal> doesn't compute
	    the resulting node-set in advance, it
	    doesn't have to 1) allocate extra memory for it
	    and 2) (more importantly) doesn't have to sort
	    the node-list in the document order (which
	    tends to be slow on large node-sets, unless
	    <xref linkend="index_command"/> is used). On the other
	    hand, <literal>iterate</literal> suffers from a considerable
	    speed penalty since it isn't implemented in C (unlike
	    libxml2's XPath engine).
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    Author's experience shows that, unless <xref linkend="index_command"/>
	    is used, <literal>iterate</literal> beats
	    <xref linkend="foreach"/> in speed on large
	    node-lists (&gt;=1500 nodes, but your milage may vary) while
	    <xref linkend="foreach"/> wins on smaller node-lists.
	  </para>
	  <para>The following two examples give equivalent results.
	    However, the one using <literal>iterate</literal> 
	    may be faster if the number of nodes being counted 
	    is huge and document order isn't indexed.</para>
	  <example>
	    <title>Count inhabitants of the kingdom of Rohan in productive age</title>
	    <code>cd rohan/inhabitants;</code>
	    <code>iterate child::*[@age&gt;=18 and @age&lt;60] { perl $productive++ };</code>

	<shortdesc>process selected elements from an XML stream (EXPERIMENTAL)</shortdesc>
	<description>
	  <para>
	    EXPERIMENTAL!  This command provides a memory efficient
	    (though slower) way to process selected parts of an XML
	    document with &XSH;. A streaming XML parser (SAX parser) is
	    used to parse the input. The parser has two states which
	    will be referred to as A and B below. The initial state of
	    the parser is A.</para> <para>In the state A, only a
	    limited vertical portion of the DOM tree is built. All XML
	    data coming from the input stream other than start-tags
	    are immediately copied to the output stream.  If a new
	    start-tag of an element arrives, a new node is created in
	    the tree. All siblings of the newly created node are
	    removed. Thus, in the state A, there is exactly one node
	    on every level of the tree. After a node is added to the
	    tree, all the <xref linkend="xpath"/> expressions
	    following the <literal>select</literal> keyword
	    are
	    checked. If none matches, the parser remains in state A
	    and copies the start-tag to the output stream. Otherwise,
	    the first expression that matches is remembered and the
	    parser changes its state to B.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    In state B the parser builds a complete DOM subtree of the
	    element that was last added to the tree before the parser
	    changed its state from A to B. No data are sent to the
	    output at this stage. When the subtree is complete
	    (i.e. the corresponding end-tag for its topmost element is
	    encountered), the <xref linkend="block"/> of instructions
	    following the <xref linkend="xpath"/> expression that
	    matched is invoked with the root element of the subtree as
	    the current context node. The commands in <xref linkend="block"/> are allowed to transform the whole
	    element subtree or even to replace it with a different DOM
	    subtree or subtrees. They must, however, leave intact 
	    all ancestor nodes of the subtree. 
            Failing to do so can result in an error or
	    unpredictable results.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    After the subtree processing <xref linkend="block"/>
	    returns, all subtrees that now appear in the DOM tree in
	    the place of the original subtree are serialized to the
	    output stream. After that, they are deleted and the parser
	    returns to state A.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    Note that this type of processing highly limits the amount
	    of information the selecting XPath expressions can use. The first
	    notable fact is, that elements can not be selected by their
	    content. The only information present in the tree at the
	    time of the XPath evaluation is the element's name and
	    attributes plus the same information for all its
	    ancestors (there is no information at all about its possible
	    child nodes nor of the node's position
	    within the list of its siblings).

	    This function is very similar to EXSLT

	    specification</ulink>.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    The <literal>xsh:map</literal> function evaluates the

	    the nodes passed as the first argument, and returns a 
	    node-set of those values. 
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    The expressions are evaluated relative to the nodes 
	    passed as the first argument. In other words, the value 
	    for each node is calculated by evaluating the XPath 
	    expression with all context information being the same as 
	    that for the call to the <literal>xsh:map</literal>
	    function itself, except for the following: 
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    1) the context node is the node whose value is being
	    calculated, 2) the context position is the position of the
	    node within the node set passed as the first argument to
	    the <literal>xsh:map</literal> function, arranged in
	    document order, and 3) the context size is the number of
	    nodes passed as the first argument to the dyn:map function.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    If the expression string passed as the second argument is
	    an invalid XPath expression (including an empty string),
	    this function returns an empty node set.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    If <literal>XPATH</literal> evaluates as a node set, the
	    <literal>xsh:map</literal> function returns the union of
	    the node sets returned by evaluating the expression for
	    each of the nodes in the first argument. Note that this
	    may mean that the node set resulting from the call to the
	    <literal>xsh:map</literal> function contains a different
	    number of nodes from the number in the node set passed as
	    the first argument to the function.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    If <literal>XPATH</literal> evaluates as a number, the

	    (namespace
	    <literal>http://xsh.sourceforge.net/xsh/</literal>) for
	    each node in the node set passed as the first argument to
	    the dyn:map function, in document order. The string value
	    of each <literal>xsh:number</literal> element is the same
	    as the result of converting the number resulting from
	    evaluating the expression to a string as with the number
	    function, with the exception that Infinity results in an
	    <literal>xsh:number</literal> holding the highest number
	    the implementation can store, and -Infinity results in an
	    <literal>xsh:number</literal> holding the lowest number
	    the implementation can store.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    If <literal>XPATH</literal> evaluates as a boolean, the
	    <literal>xsh:map</literal> function returns a node set
	    containing one <literal>xsh:boolean</literal> element
	    (namespace
	    <literal>http://xsh.sourceforge.net/xsh/</literal>) for
	    each node in the node set passed as the first argument to
	    the <literal>xsh:map</literal> function, in document
	    order. The string value of each
	    <literal>xsh:boolean</literal> element is
	    <literal>true</literal> if the expression evaluates as
	    true for the node, and is empty if the expression evaluates as
	    false.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    Otherwise, the <literal>xsh:map</literal> function returns
	    a node set containing one <literal>xsh:string</literal>
	    element (namespace
	    <literal>http://xsh.sourceforge.net/xsh/</literal>) for
	    each node in the node set passed as the first argument to
	    the <literal>xsh:map</literal> function, in document
	    order. The string value of each
	    <literal>xsh:string</literal> element is the same as the

	    This function provides direct access to the very powerful
	    Perl function <literal>split</literal>. It splits
	    <literal>STRING</literal> to a list of
	    fields. <literal>PATTERN</literal> is a regular expression
	    specifying strings delimiting individual fields of
	    <literal>STRING</literal>. If <literal>PATTERN</literal>
	    is empty, <literal>STRING</literal> is split to individual
	    characters. If the regular expression in
	    <literal>PATTERN</literal> is enclosed in brackets, then
	    strings matching <literal>PATTERN</literal> are also
	    included in the resulting list.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    The function returns a node-set consisting of
