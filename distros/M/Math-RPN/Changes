Revision history for Perl extension Math::RPN.

1.11 2012.07.27
    - cosmetic changes
    - Move to Github

1.10 2009.04.25

    - Some documentation cleanup.
    - The warning about XOR removed, tests added
    - Warning about ^ being "power" and bitwise xor is added.
    - Add more tests

1.09 2009.04.22
    - Maintainership received by Gabor Szabo
    - Testing framework changed to Test::More

1.08  Sun Jul 29 12:29:00 2001
    - Should have tested the POD before checking it in.  (!)

1.07  Sun Jul 29 12:12:00 2001
    - Added ones-compliment functionality

    - Synchronized ALL files SCCS versions

1.06  Sun Jul 29 11:52:00 2001
    - Integrated into SCCS (versions above don't necessarily match,
      versions below will).

    - Created build directory with SCCS files

    - Created mkdist script to compute version and create file for
      upload to CPAN.


1.05  Fri Jul 27 15:49:00 2001
    - Added additional mathematical functionality
        ABS
        INCR/++
        DECR/--
        AND/&
        OR/|
        NOT/!
        TAN
        INT
        RAND
        LRAND

    - Added XOR as experimental.  Perl's XOR doesn't seem to behave
      as expected.  As such, XOR isn't tested, but there's a commented
      out test for it.  If you know what's wrong with PERL XOR, or what
      I did wrong in the code, please email owen@delong.com.  Thanks!

    - Enhanced diagnostics


1.04  Thu Jul 26 08:17:00 2001
    - Modified calling sequence to support standard PERL list passing
      style so that you can pass any number of scalars in and they
      will be treated as one big RPN expression.

    - Improved compile efficiency by moving stack checks to subroutine

    - Expanded documentation detail


1.03  Wed Jul 25 17:46:00 2001
    - Updated Changes file to include information on 1.01 and 1.02

1.02  Tue Jul 24 21:26:00 2001
    - Made modifications to test.pl to try and resolve problems
      created by differences in rounding on different platforms.

1.01  Mon Jul 23 16:25:00 2001
    - Improved documentation and cleaned up some errors in the POD

1.00  Mon Jul 16 23:33:00 2001
    - Template filled in and module ready for testing as Math::RPN

0.01  Mon Jul 16 23:08:27 2001
    - original version; created by h2xs 1.19
