DESCRIPTION

    Thinish wrapper of the VMware vCloud Director REST API.

    THIS IS AT AN EARLY STAGE OF DEVELOPMENT - PROTOTYPING REALLY - AND MAY
    CHANGE DRAMATICALLY OR EAT YOUR DATA.

    The target application is to read information from a vCloud instance,
    so the ability to change or write data to the vCloud system has not
    been implemented as yet...
