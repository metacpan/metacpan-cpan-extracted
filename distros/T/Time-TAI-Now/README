NAME

Time::TAI::Now - determine current time in TAI

DESCRIPTION

This module is one answer to the question "what time is it?".
It determines the current time on the TAI scale, and puts a bound on how
inaccurate it could be.  It is designed to interoperate with Time::TAI,
which knows all about the TAI time scale.

TAI (International Atomic Time) is a time scale produced by an ensemble of
atomic clocks around Terra.  It attempts to tick at the rate of proper
time on the Terran geoid (i.e., at sea level).  It is the frequency
standard underlying Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).

TAI is not connected to planetary rotation, and so has no inherent
concept of a "day" or of "time of day".  (There is nevertheless a
convention for how to represent TAI times using day-based notations,
for which see Time::TAI.)  This module represents instants on the TAI
time scale as a scalar number of TAI seconds since its epoch, which
was at 1958-01-01T00:00:00.0 UT2 as calculated by the United States
Naval Observatory.  This matches the convention used by "Time::TAI".
