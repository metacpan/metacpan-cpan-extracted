NAME
    macro - An implementation of macro processor

VERSION
    This document describes macro version 0.06.

SYNOPSIS
            use macro add => sub{ $_[0] + $_[1] };
                      say => sub{ print @_, "\n"};
            say(add(1, 3)); # it's replaced into 'print do{ (1) + (3) }, "\n";'

            use macro my_if => sub{ $_[0] ? $_[1] : $_[2] };
            my_if( 0, say('true'), say('false') ); # only 'false' is printed

            sub mul{ $_[0] * $_[1] }
            use macro mul => \&mul;
            say( mul(2, 3) ); # macro version of mul()
            say(&mul(2, 3) ); # subroutine version
            say( mul 2, 3  ); # subroutine version

            # or compile only
            $ perl -c Module.pm # make Module.pmc

DESCRIPTION
    The "macro" pragma provides macros, a sort of inline functions, which is
    like C pre-processor's macro.

    The macros are very fast (about 200% faster than subroutines), but they
    have some limitations that C pre-processor's macros have, e.g. they
    cannot call "return()" expectedly, although they seem anonymous
    subroutines.

    Try "PERL_MACRO_DEBUG=2" if you want to know how this module works.

  PMC Support
    Modules using "macro" are able to compile themselves before installed,
    by using the "Module::Install::PMC". Write the following to the
    "Makefile.PL" and the modules will be compiled at build time.

            use inc::Module::Install;
            ...
            build_requires macro => 0;
            pmc_support;
            ...

    See Module::Compile and Module::Install::PMC for details.

METHODS
  macro->backend()
    Returns the backend module, "macro::filter" or "macro::compiler".

  macro->new()
    Returns an instance of macro processor, $macro.

    "new()", "defmacro()" and "process()" are provided for backend modules.

  $macro->defmacro(name => sub{ ... });
    Defines macros into *$macro*.

  $macro->process($source)
    Processes Perl source code *$source*, and returns processed source code.

CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT
  PERL_MACRO_DEBUG=value
    Sets the debug mode.

    if it's == 0, "macro::compiler" is used as the backend.

    if it's >= 1, "macro::filter" is used as the backend.

    If it's >= 2, all macro expansions are reported to "STDERR".

INSTALL
    To install this module, run the following commands:

            perl Makefile.PL
            make
            make test
            make install

DEPENDENCIES
    *   Perl 5.8.1 or later.

    *   "PPI" - Perl parser.

    *   "Filter::Util::Call" - Source filter utility (CORE).
