NAME
    XML::RSS::JavaScript - serialize your RSS as JavaScript

SYNOPSIS
        use XML::RSS::JavaScript;
        my $rss = XML::RSS::JavaScript->new();
        $rss->channel(
        title        => 'My Channel',
        link        => 'http://my.url.com',
        description => 'My RSS Feed.'
        );

        $rss->add_item(
        title        => 'My item #1',
        link        => 'http://my.item.com#1',
        description => 'My first news item.'
        );

        $rss->add_item( 
        title        => 'My item #2',
        link        => 'http://my.item.com#2',
        description => 'My second news item.'
        );

        # save rss 
        $rss->save( '/usr/local/apache/htdocs/myfeed.xml' );

        # save identical content as javascript
        $rss->save_javascript( '/usr/local/apache/htdocs/myfeed.js');

DESCRIPTION
    Perhaps you use XML::RSS to generate RSS for consumption by RSS parsers.
    Perhaps you also get requests for how to use the RSS feed by people who
    have no idea how to parse XML, or write Perl programs for that matter.

    Enter XML::RSS::JavaScript, a simple subclass of XML::RSS which writes
    your RSS feed as a sequence of JavaScript print statements. This means
    you can then write the JavaScript to disk, and a users HTML can simply
    *include* it like so:

        <script language="JavaScript" src="/myfeed.js"></script>

    What's more the javascript emits HTML that can be fully styled with CSS.
    See the CSS examples included with the distribution in the css
    directory.

        <html>
        <head>
        <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/css/rollover1.css">
        </head>
        <body>
        Your content here...
        <script language="JavaScript" src="http://my.feed.com//myfeed.js"></script>
        </body>
        </html>

INSTALLATION
        perl Makefile.PL
        make
        make test
        make install

METHODS
  save_javascript()
    Pass in the path to a file you wish to write your javascript in.
    Optionally you can pass in the maximum amount of items to include from
    the feed and a boolean value to switch descriptions on or off (default:
    on).

        # save all the content 
        save_javascript( '/usr/local/apache/htdocs/rss/myfeed.js' );

        # no more than 10 items:
        save_javascript( '/usr/local/apache/htdocs/rss/myfeed.js', 10 );

        # save all items without descriptions:
        save_javascript( '/usr/local/apache/htdocs/rss/myfeed.js', undef, 0 );

  as_javascript()
    as_javascript will return a string containing javascript suitable for
    generating text for your RSS object. You can pass in the maximum amount
    of items to include by passing in an integer as an argument and a
    boolean value to switch descriptions on or off (default: on). If you
    pass in no argument you will get the contents of the entire object.

        $js = $rss->as_javascript();

  save_json( )
    Pass in the path to a file you wish to write your javascript in.
    Optionally you can pass in any options that would normally get passed to
    "as_json".

  as_json( )
    as_json will return a string containing json suitable for generating
    text for your RSS object. You can pass in the maximum amount of items to
    include by passing in an integer as an argument. If you pass in no
    argument you will get the contents of the entire object. You can also
    pass in the name of the JSON object (default: RSSJSON).

MORE EXAMPLES
    Perhaps you want to get an existing RSS feed, suck it in, and write it
    out as JavaScript for easy consumption.

        use XML::RSS::JavaScript;
        use LWP::Simple;

        my $xml = get( 'http://slashdot.org/slashdot.rss' );
        my $rss = XML::RSS::JavaScript->new();
    
        $rss->parse( $xml );
        print $rss->as_javascript();
