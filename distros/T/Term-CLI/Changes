    [Code Cleanup]
    - Tests and modules pass perlcritic's "stern" (-4) filter.
    - Apply perltidy.
    - Properly localise %SIG in `readline`.
    - POD fixes.
    - Remove unnecessary `else` and `elsif`.
    - Run code through perltidy.
    - Eliminate some unnecessary else/elsif.
    - Remove default export of `loc` from `Term::CLI::L10N`
        Explicitly import `loc` in all modules that need it.
    - Do not use `package Foo {}` syntax.
        All modules have only one `package`, so the block syntax
        doesn't add anything and causes perltidy to unnecessarily
        indent all code.

    [Enhancements]
    - Improve filename completion for non-GNU readline
        The glob variation now uses a trick when completing directory
        names that prevents the readline module from adding a space.

        Files modified:
            lib/Term/CLI/Argument/Filename.pm

    - Add CONTRIBUTING.md, Contributors; fix README

    - Add a `clear_error` method to Term::CLI::Base
      and use it instead of `set_error('')`.


    [Bug Fixes]
    - Fix potential bug in line splitting (Term::CLI).

    - Work around for old Pod::Text::Termcap, closes #12
        Versions of `Pod::Text::Termcap` before 4.11 had a bug (#124447)
        that resulted in it using a screen width of 80, regardless of what
        was specified in the constructor call or environment. As a result,
        the high `=over` indents could cause very strange output or even
        make `Pod::Text::Termcap` spin into an eternal loop.

        To make life easier for those with older Perl installations,
        we test for the older `Pod::Text::Termcap` version and use
        `Pod::Text::Overstrike` instead if necessary. The overstrike
        variant does not contain the screen width bug, although it does
        require a pager that understands overstrike sequences. The default
        pager for `Term::CLI` (`less`) does, so the invonvenience should
        be minor.

        Thanks to djerius for reporting and diagnosing the problem.

    [Compatibility]

    - Fix versions of used modules for Perl 5.14.1
        If we claim to to be compatible with Perl 5.14, then we should
        make sure that the minimum required version of modules included
        in the default distribution match up with what we require.

    - Use `bsd_glob` instead of `:bsd_glob`
        `File::Glob` in Perl 5.14 didn't have the `:bsd_glob` tag yet.
        Since we only need the `bsd_glob()` function, just import the
        function.

    [Bug Fixes]

    - Make sure Term::ReadKey uses a "TTY" filehandle
        In cases of automatic builds, STDIN and STDOUT may be
        redirected. Term::ReadLine can handle that, Term::ReadKey
        cannot, so we need to be explicit.

0.053001 -- 2021-12-22

    [Features]

    - Now indepenent of Term::ReadLine implementation
        I.e. compatible with Term::ReadLine::Perl and Term::ReadLine::Stub
        as well (though Term::ReadLine::Gnu is still the best supported).

    - Improved signal handling:
        - Add `ignore_keyboard_signal`.
        - Ignore QUIT control sequence (makes ::Gnu behave like ::Perl).

    - Allow Term::CLI::Argument::Enum values to be provided dynamically
        Term::CLI::Argument::Enum's value_list attribute may be a coderef,
        which should return an array reference of valid values.
        (Pull request #13 from djerius/dynamic-enum.)

    - Add "cleanup" attribute.

    [Tutorial]

    - Formatting fixes.
    - Add SIGNAL HANDLING section.
    - Add HISTORY HANDLING section.
    - Add tutorial/example_17_suspend.pl
    - Use `local($SIG{...})` in `sleep` command.

    [Refactoring]

    - Move most history logic to Term::CLI::ReadLine
        Term::CLI::ReadLine is much more of a compatibility layer
        between Term::CLI and Term::ReadLine now, providing compatibility
        code to compensate for missing functionality in the underlying
        Term::ReadLine implementation.

    [Bug Fixes]

    - Fix Enum validation - closes #10
        Enum validation finds potential matches to an argument by performing
        prefix comparison against the list of valid values. This works fine
        as long as the valid values are not prefixes of each other; if they
        are, then the shorter strings will never be considered valid input.

    - GNU ReadLine - exclude prompt ornaments for leading/trailing whitespace.
        The Term::ReadLine::GNU implementation will just slap the prompt
        between the ornament-start/ornament-end sequences, but this looks
        ugly if there are leading/trailing spaces and the ornament is set
        to e.g. underline or standout. This is now brought in line with how
        the Term::ReadLine::Perl implementation handles it, by inserting
        relevant escape sequences where necessary.

    [Packaging]

    - Various build fixes.
    - Remove prereq on Term::ReadLine::Gnu.

    - Packaging fixes.
    - POD fixes.
    - Get rid of `Modern::Perl` dependency (add `Term::CLI::PerlFeatures`)

    - Force use of `Term::ReadLine::Gnu`
        `Term::ReadLine` *always* looks at the `PERL_RL` environment variable.
        This is a problem if your applications depends on not just
        `Term::ReadLine`, but features of `Term::ReadLine::Gnu` in particular.

        The way we can force the issue, is to make sure we override `PERL_RL`
        before loading `Term::ReadLine`.

        The workaround only works if `Term::ReadLine` has not been loaded by
        another module yet.

        Hopefully, this fixes the CPAN tests on FreeBSD as well.
