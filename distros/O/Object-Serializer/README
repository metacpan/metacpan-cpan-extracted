NAME
    Object::Serializer - General Purpose Object Serializer

VERSION
    version 0.000011

SYNOPSIS
        package Point;

        use Moo;
        use parent 'Object::Serializer';

        has 'x' => (is => 'rw');
        has 'y' => (is => 'rw');

        package main;

        my $point = Point->new(x => 10, y => 10);

        # serialize the class instance into a hash
        my $hash = $point->serialize; # { __CLASS__ => 'Point', x => 10, y => 10 }

DESCRIPTION
    Getting objects into an ideal format for passing representations in and
    out of applications can be a real pain. Object::Serializer is a fast and
    simple pure-perl framework-agnostic type-less none-opinionated
    light-weight primitive general purpose object serializer which tries to
    help make object serialization easier. This module is useful in
    situations when you have blessed objects you wish to produce hash
    representations from which you can store directly or convert to JSON,
    YAML, or XML. This module does not currently support deserialization.

METHODS
  serialize
    The serialize method expects an object and returns a serialized
    (hashified) version of that object.

        my $hash = $self->serialize;
        my $hash = $self->serialize($object);
        my $hash = $self->serialize($object, marker => undef); # no marker

  serialization_strategy_for
    The serialization_strategy_for method expects a reftype and a
    sub-routine. This method registers a custom serialization strategy which
    will be used during the collapsing of the reference type specified.

        CLASS->serialization_strategy_for(
            REFTYPE => sub { ... }
        );

EXTENSION
    Object::Serializer can be used as a serializer independently, however,
    it is primarily designed to be used as a base class for your classes or
    roles. By default, Object::Serializer doesn't do anything special for
    you in the way of serialization, in-fact, it is little more than a
    wrapper around Data::Dumper. Additionally, you can hook into the
    serialization process by defining your serialization strategy using your
    own custom serialization routines which will be executed whenever a
    specific reference type is encountered. The following syntax is what you
    might use to register your own custom serialization strategy. This
    example registers a custom serializer that is executed globally whenever
    a DateTime object is found.

        Object::Serializer->serialization_strategy_for(
            DateTime => sub { pop->iso8601 }
        );

    Additionally, you can register a serialization strategy to be used only
    when invoked by a specific class. The following syntax is what you might
    use to register a serialization strategy to be executed only for a
    specific class:

        Point->serialization_strategy_for(
            DateTime => sub { pop->iso8601 }
        );

CAVEATS
    Circular references are problematic and should be avoided, you can
    weaken or otherwise handle them yourself then re-assemble them later as
    a means toward getting around this.
