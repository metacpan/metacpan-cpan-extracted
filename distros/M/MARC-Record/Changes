Revision history for Perl extension MARC::Record.

2.0.7 Tue May 23 20:41:13 EDT 2017
        [FIXES]
        - RT#108123: clean up MANIFEST.SKIP
        - GH#1: marcdump now prints warnings (Johann Rolschewski)
        - remove a reference to SourceForge
        - fix a reference to the per4lib mailing list

2.0.6 Tue Oct 22 16:17:06 UTC 2013
        [ENHANCEMENTS]
        - MARC::Field->as_string() now accepts an optional second
          parameter to specify the delimiter to use between
          subfields. (Tomas Cohen Arazi)
        - MARC::Field->delete_subfield() can now accept a regexp
          to specify the subfields to remove.  For example, to
          remove all numeric subfields, one can say:

          $field->delete_subfield(code => qr/\d/);

          (Jason Stephenson)
        [FIXES]
        - the warnings pragma is now used throughout MARC::Record
        - $field->as_string('0') now returns the contents of
          subfield $0 rather than the contents of all of the
          subfields in the field.
        - RT#88421: add newline after printing warnings
          (Jason Stephenson)
        - RT#85804: fix spelling glitch (Gregor Herrmann)

2.0.5 Mon Feb 11 20:39:10 PST 2013
        - fix use of qw(...) in test case so that module passes
          tests with Perl 5.17.x.

2.0.4 Sat Feb  9 19:01:47 PST 2013
        [ENHANCEMENTS]
        - add MARC::Field->set_indicator($indpos, $indval), a mutator
          for indicators
        - add MARC::Field->set_tag to allow tags to be renamed
          (Robin Sheat)
        - delete_subfield(), if given a single subfield label as its
          argument, will delete all instances of the specified
          subfield, increasing its DWIM factor
        - improved POD for MARC::Field->delete_subfield()
        [FIXES]
        - RT#70346: delete_subfield() no longer clears entire field if
          arguments are badly formatted
        - croak if invalid arguments are passed to delete_subfield()
        - fix error in tutorial (thanks to Tom Burton-West for the
          catch)
        - RT#76990: emit leader of correct length even if record longer
          than 99,999 octets (Julian Maurice)
        - RT#67094: croak with correct error if attempting to create
          MARC::Field sans subfields
        - corrected POD for indicator() method
        - move tag validity check to new class method,
          is_valid_tag($tagno)
        - move indicator validity check to new class method,
          is_valid_indicator($indval)
        - have MARC::Record pass perlcritic --gentle (mostly)
        - remove function prototypes
          (see http://www.perlmonks.org/?node_id=861966)

2.0.3 Fri Jan 14 17:50:12 EST 2011
        - RT#62296: fix crash when dealing with record bigger than
          99999 bytes (Alex Arnaud)
        - test cases for MARC::Field->subfields()
        - RT#61198: let subfields return an empty array on control
          fields (Colin Campbell)

2.0.2 Tue May  4 13:04:07 EDT 2010
        - RT#57180: put back and expanded copyright statement in README
          at Debian request
        - set license element in META.yml

2.0.1 Sat May  1 15:59:54 EDT 2010
        [ENHANCEMENTS]
        - improve support for subclassing MARC::Field (Dan Wells)
        - RT#55993: MARC::Record->insert_fields_after can now insert 
          after last field in record (Frédéric Demians)
        - added methods to MARC::Field to allow a (class-level) list of 
          fields that should be considered control fields in addition 
          to 001-009. Includes test t/extra_controlfields.t, and 
          supports alphabetic characters in the tag labels.  The new 
          methods are
               allow_controlfield_tags
               disallow_controlfield_tags
               is_controlfield_tag
          (Bill Dueber)
        - added MARC::Record::delete_fields() and t/delete-field.t 
          (Ed Summers)
        - documentation improvements (Mike Rylander and Dan Scott)
        - baked in minimum Perl version required: 5.8.2

2.0
        [THINGS THAT MAY BREAK YOUR CODE]
        - Perl 5.8.2 required for utf8 handling

        [ENHANCEMENTS]
        - removed dead utf8 handling code
        - added MARC::File::Encode wrapper around Encode module since
          Encode exports encode() by default which conflicts with existing
          MARC::File::Encode::encode (yuck).
        - added MARC::Record::encoding() for getting/setting record encoding
        - modified t/utf8.t to unconditionally do tests since a modern
          perl will now be required.
        - Added --hex switch to marcdump, which dumps the record in
          hexadecimal.  The offsets are in decimal so that you can match
          them up to values in the leader.  The offset is reset to 0
          when we're past the directory so that you can match up the data
          with the offsets in the directory.
        - docfixes in Record.pm (thanks Todd Holbrook)
        - added MARC::Field->delete_subfields

1.39_02 Tue Dec 21 09:29:45 CST 2004

        [THINGS THAT MAY BREAK YOUR CODE]
        - Removed the ability to call new from an instance of MARC::Record
          or MARC::Field.  Any place where you might have code like:

              my $rec = MARC::Record->new();
              ...
              my $another = $rec->new();

          will have to be changed to:

              my $rec = MARC::Record->new();
              ...
              my $class = ref( $rec );
              my $another = $class->new();

          or:

              my $rec = MARC::Record->new();
              ...
              my $another = MARC::Record->new();
        - Removed MARC::Lint and the marclint utility to a separate
          package on CPAN.
        - MARC::Doc::Tutorial.pod updated to reflect the change.
        - Fixed t/50.batch.t to use File::Spec in the MicroLIF section
        - Other tests in t/ also use File::Spec to specify paths

        - MARC::File::USMARC ignores \x1a, the DOS end-of-file character,
        between records and at the end of files.
        - Added corresponding tests dosEOF.t, cameleof.usmarc, and
        sample1eof.usmarc.

        [FIXES]
        - Clarified docs on the interface to field(), and fixed problem
          whereby in scalar context if no match was found we were
          returning an empty list instead of undef.  Strictly speaking,
          this is an interface change, but in practice anyone making this
          call in a scalar context was going to get 0, which if used as
          a MARC::Field would bomb.  We therefore don't expect the change
          to affect anything that wasn't already blowing up.

        - Fixed the doc and example for MARC::Field::subfields() so that
          they match the behavior of the function, namely returning a list
          rather than a list ref.

        - Fixed behavior of MARC::Batch::next() to not reset warnings
          on the MARC::Record object that it returns. Also added test to 
          t/75.warnings.t

        - Added code to MARC::MicroLIF::decode() to change line endings to those
        of the platform before decoding the passed-in string. Also added test to
        t/81.decode.t

        - Turned off utf8 handling until it can safely be done without 
          converting all MARC data to utf8.

        - Made marcdump respect --noquiet as documented.

        [ENHANCEMENTS]
        - added MARC::Field::delete_subfields() and tests to t/67.subfield.t

        - Added tests to make sure that MARC::Record::leader() adds warnings
          if called as a setter with data that isn't the right length.

        - Added explicit tests for convenience function behavior (title(),
          edition(), etc.) when there's no data.

        - Added test to verify insert_fields_before() behavior when the
          field to insert before isn't in the record.

        - Added tests to MARC::Field::indicator() to make sure that when
          called on a control field the return is undef.

1.39_01 Mon Jul 26 11:48:33 PDT 2004

        [ENHANCEMENTS]
        - Support for UTF8 in Perls >= 5.8.1. When using a utf8 friendly Perl
          all file streams will be opened in utf8 mode, and the bytes pragma
          will be used to create and use direcotry byte offsets. 

        - Added MARC::File::Utils which contains utf8 safe functions.

        - marcdump now sets STDOUT to utf8 if it is able to.

        - t/utf8.t is no longer skipped.

        - removed redundant record length check in MARC::File::USMARC::_next()
          and adjusted tests in t/75.warnings.t

        - All tests run under -T.

1.38    March 16th, 2004

        [ENHANCEMENTS]
        - Performance tweak on MARC::Field->is_control_field() since it
          gets called a lot when cloning records.
        - Performance tweak on MARC::Field->as_string(), since it gets
          called all the time.


1.36    March 9th, 2004

        [THINGS THAT MAY BREAK YOUR CODE]
        - Renamed MARC::Field->is_control_tag() to is_control_field().

        [FIXES]
        - fixed SYNOPSIS in MARC::Batch to use constructor. Thanks Ed Sperr
          New England College of Optometry.
        - fixed reference to the tutorial in README. Thanks Stephen Graham,
          London Business School.
        - marcdump and marclint didn't recognize the -v flag.
        - calls to MARC::Field::subfield() on a control field (tag < 010 ) 
          will cause a fatal error, with a friendly message telling you 
          to use data(). Similarly a call to data() on a field >= 010
          will result in a friendly error telling you to use subfield().
          Previously a warning was generated, and MARC::Field continued
          along only to barf when it was unable to find an array ref in 
          $self->{ _subfields }.

        [ENHANCEMENTS]
        - Finished documentation on all modules.  Updated t/pod-coverage.t
          to keep us in line.

1.34    December 16th, 2003
        [ENHANCEMENTS]
        - modified MARC::File::in() to allow passing in filehandles instead
          of a filename. Useful in situations where you might have data
          compressed on disk, and want to read from a decompression pipe.
          This effects MARC::Batch of course as well, which has had its
          documentation updated. 
        - added t/85.fh.t to test new filehandle passing
        - Incorrect filetypes passed in to the MARC::Batch constructor
          now croak instead of die, so you can see where in your code it
          was called.

        [FIXES]
        - etc/specs modified to correctly parse LCs docs to get the 250 $b 
          properly. Thanks Bryan Baldus at Quality Books.
        - new Lint.pm with 250 $b.
        - MARC::Field now leaves alphabetic indicators as they are instead
          of squashing to a space. Added test of new functionailty. Thanks 
          Leif Andersson from Stockholms Universitet.
        - MARC::File::USMARC no longer checks the validity of indicators
          but leaves that up to MARC::Field (instead of having the check
          twice).
        - In MARC::Batch, the 'warn' elements weren't quoted.
        - warnings_on and strict_on should now be respected.

1.33    November 24th, 2003
        MARC::Record should now run on Perls back to 5.00503!

        [FIXES]
        - fixed behavior in MARC::File::USMARC which was causing 
          MARC::File::next() to return a partial record when the record
          lacked a proper end of directory byte. RT #4474. Added regression
          test t/82.baddir.t.
        - we now warn on improper 010 tag access, not croak.
        - fixed t/80.alphatag to test new MARC::Field::data() behavior
        - doc fix to insert_field_grouped()
        - tons of fixes and additions to MARC::Doc::Tutorial

        [INTERNALS]
        - Moved pl/ to bin/
        - Split out the sfdocs stuff from Makefile.PL to bin/makesfdocs

1.32    November 5th, 2003
        [ENHANCEMENTS]
        - added insert_ordered_fields(), thanks Leif Andersson.

1.31    October 16th, 2003
        [FIXES]
        - set_leader_lengths() will now also set other MARC21 leader defaults.
          Postitions 10-11, 20-23. For details on the defaults see:
          http://www.loc.gov/marc/bibliographic/ecbdldrd.html 
        - MARC::Batch::next() now accepts a filter function.
        - Fixed an incorrect instruction in MARC::File::MicroLIF.
        - marclint actually counts the number of records now.

        [DOCUMENTATION]
        - Added sample usage for insert_grouped_fields()
        - Added example about subfield v to x conversion to tutorial.
        - Documentation fix for MARC::Field::new().
        - Fixed useage of MARC::Record::append_fields() in example 17
          of the Tutorial.
        - Added TODO test for utf8 handling (utf8.t)
        - Fixed doc bug in MARC::File::USMARC (#2937)

1.30    There is no 1.30.  We skipped a number.

1.29    June 05, 2003   
        [ENHANCEMENTS]
        - MARC::Field::subfield() will return a list of all subfield
          data when called in a list context...and only the first when
          called in a scalar context. Also added a test 67.subfield.t
          to test new functionality.

1.28    May 23, 2003
        [FIXES]
        - Fixed MARC::Lint::check_record()'s checking for multiple 1XX tags.

        - Fixed the docs for MARC::Lint and what errors it says it catches.

1.27    May 22, 2003
        [ENHANCMENTS]
        - MARC::Field::update() by default will append any subfields which do
          not exist in the record to the end of the field. Added tests to test
          the new functionality to 60.update.t

        [FIXES]
        - Updated MARC::Lint to use the latest field/subfield designations from
          the Library of Congress.  The data for MARC::Lint is now
          automatically generated from the LC webpage.  Thanks to Colin
          Campbell of Sirsi for the program that does the translation.

        - removed MARC::Lint check_260() since a subfield c is not 
          mandatory (see RT #1565).

1.26    May 8, 2003
        [FIXES]
        - Removed the "use warnings" in the couple of files that used it.
          This obviates the need for the pre5006.patch file.

        - Fixed some warnings for undefs.  These only turned up because
          Test::Harness now has warnings turned on.

1.25    April 22, 2003
        NO CHANGES.  Just compensating for upload problems.

1.24    April 22, 2003
        [ENHANCEMENTS]
        - expanded documentation for MARC::Field::as_string()

        [FIX]
        - modified MARC::File::USMARC to silently ignore any
          combination of nulls, spaces, CRs, and LFs between
          records.  (They're not allowed to be there, but some
          vendors put them there anyway.)  With this change in
          place you will now get the complete record--if the
          inter-record garbage is the only problem--rather than
          a record with (usually) zero fields.

1.23    March 30, 2003
        [FIX]
        - removed t/85.utf8.t since it did not work
        - removed bytes pragma usage since there is no feasible way to 
          get MARC::Record to properly handle utf8 while it is using 
          substr() so heavily. substr() uses character lengths, and 
          directory positions measure lengths in bytes.
        - updated pre5006.patch to only remove warnings pragma

1.22    March 23, 2003
        - added t/85.utf8.t to test record lengths work when utf8 data
          is present in a record (regression test for RT #2165)
        - warnings and bytes pragmas are now explicit
        - added patch for removing warnings and bytes pragmas for Perl 
          versions < 5.006
        - updated README to include information about the patch
        [FIX]
        - removed warnings pragma from MARC/File/USMARC.pm and 
          MARC/File/MicroLIF.pm since with warnings on, they generate quite 
          a few warnings. These are mainly thrown by substr() when 
          working with invalid MARC data.

1.21    March 14, 2003
        [ENHANCEMENTS]
        - MARC::File::MicroLIF now reads the MicroLIF header from
          the input file and makes it available via the header()
          call.  If there is no header in the file, header()
          will return undef.  Because the header is now taken
          care of when the file is opened, 
          MARC::File::MicroLIF::decode no longer supports skipping 
          the file header.
        - MARC:File::MicroLIF::decode now detects fields that
          have no subfields (other than 001-009) rather than
          passing them through to MARC::Field which croak()s.
          When such a tag is encountered it is thrown away and
          a warning added to the MARC::Record, rather than
          allowing MARC::Field to croak().
        - Updated data files used to test MARC::File::MicroLIF
          so that they have a header.

        [FIXES]
        - MARC:File::MicroLIF now supports input files with any
          type of line ending--\x0d, \x0a, or \x0d\0a.  A file no
          longer has to have created on a system with compatible
          line endings.
        - Fixed invalid assumption in MARC::File::MicroLIF that
          the MicroLIF header is supposed to begin with 'HDR'.

1.20    February 26, 2003
        [FIXES]
        - Removed $VERSION from all modules except for MARC::Record
          itself.
        - Fixed a $VERSION problem in MARC::Record that prevented CPAN
          from indexing the module correctly.
        - Added more tests to the .t files.

1.18    February 16, 2003
        [ENHANCEMENTS]
        - when MARC::Batch::no_strict() will allow you to read in 
          records with invalid record lengths.
        [FIXES]
        - Changes to MARC::File::USMARC->decode() to fix the
          rt.cpan.org bug #2017, "MARC::File::USMARC assumes 
          that fields apper in directory order".
        - Stricter checking on MARC directory entries.

1.17    January 29, 2003
        [ENHANCEMENTS]
        - Added optional subfield string to MARC::Field::as_string().
        - Added tag-based filtering on the USMARC constructors and 
          passthru support for this in MARC::File::next().  Now you can 
          select which tags get put into your MARC record, and not have
          to pay the processing costs for fields you're going to ignore.
        - title_proper() now returns the _a, _n and _p from the 245 in
          whatever order they happen to appear.  Thanks to Anne Highsmith
          for the change and the test data.
        - Minor speed tweaks when checking for tags < 010
        - Made the POD checking in t/99.pod.t work better.  Eventually I
          need to make the same changes into Test::Pod.

1.16    January 28, 2003
        [ENHANCEMENTS]
        - title() and author() now return empty strings, rather than
          "<No XXX found>"
        - Added title_proper(), edition() and publication_date()
          convenience methods to MARC::Record.
        - Added more unit tests.

        [FIXES]
        - marcdump utility will not output LDR when running under --field 
          option, unless the LDR is specifically asked for.

1.15    December 8, 2002
        [FIXES]
        - Ignores and warns about any completely empty subfields (i.e. not
          even any indicators)
        - MARC::File::USMARC::decode and MARC::File::MicroLIF::decode needed to
          be able to be called in a variety of ways: $obj->decode(), 
          MARC::File::MicroLIF->decode() and MARC::File::MicroLIF::decode()
          Added t/081.decode.t to make sure things are shipshape.

1.14    November 27, 2002
        [FIXES]
        - Fixed bug in MARC::File::USMARC that was set off by failure of 
          t/75.warnings.t under ActivePerl and CygWin.

1.13    November 26, 2002 
        [ENHANCEMENTS]
        - Moved new_from_usmarc() docs & code up right after new() to 
          be more prominent. Thanks to Chris Biemesderfer for pointing this 
          out.
        - Added Chris Biemesderfer's section to the tutorial which 
          discusses using MARC::Record with Net::Z3950.
        - Yet another overhaul to MARC::Batch to allow for error trapping. 
          Added the warnings_on() warnings_off() methods to turn on/off 
          warnings on STDERR. Also added strict_on() and strict_off() to 
          change the behavior of next() when an error is encountered.
          Thanks to Rob Fox of Notre Dame for providing guidance on the type
          of behavior that is really needed when batch processing.
        - Added new tests for the improved handling of errors in MARC::Batch.
        - Added new warnings and strict methods to MARC::Doc::Tutorial, also
          added more use of MARC::Batch instead of using MARC::File directly.
        - Improved docs on some functions to explicitly says what gets
          returned from each function.

1.12    October 9, 2002 
        [ENHANCEMENTS]
        - Makefile.PL will now generate PDF and HTML documentation for 
          Sourceforge when asked to.
        - Added a test for insert_field_grouped()
        - Added subject heading example to Tutorial
        - Fixed typo in docs for MARC::Record::append_fields()
        - Added code (and tests) for allowing users to specify alphanumeric
          tags. This is little used, but it's in the spec, and someone asked
          for it (Notre Dame). Edits were to MARC::Field and to a lesser
          extent MARC::Record.

1.11    September 10, 2002
        [ENHANCEMENTS]
        - Added a 99.pod.t to check pod
        - insert_fields_before(), insert_fields_after(), appned_fields(),
          and insert_grouped_fields() now call croak() instead of _gripe
          in order to help MARC::Record users to locate where their call 
          is failing. Thanks to Jackie Shieh for pointing this out.
        - MARC::Batch is now fault tolerant, in that it will store 
          warnings about file format problems, but will not bomb out. 
          The method MARC::Batch::warnings() can be used to get info
          about what went wrong while reading a record, and users can
          determine what to do. Thanks to Betsy Earl for solidifying the
          need for this.

1.10    August 30, 2002
        [ENHANCEMENTS]
        - Now runs under Perl 5.005.  All you people who have older Perls can
          now share in the joy that is MARC::Record.
        - Added warnings() and _warn methods to MARC::Batch, MARC::File to 
          support warning collection and reporting.
        - Added use bytes to MARC::File::USMARC so that calls to length() will
          return actual bytes rather than characters if Unicode characters are
          found in the data.  This only works if you're using 5.6.0+.

        [FIXES]
        - Modified MARC::File::USMARC::_next() to slurp in a record using
          local $/ = 0x1D, rather than reading record length and then calling
          read(). This will allow recovery from invalid leaders in batch 
          reading. 

1.00    July 3, 2002
        - _gripe() fires off warnings instead of dying silently.
        - MARC::File::USMARC no longer creates an error if it's and the
          end of a file when it tries to next().
        - Tests use the isa_ok() function to be more stringent in checking
          return values from functions.

0.94    June 10, 2002
        - Added $MARC::Record::DEBUG
        - Added --debug flag to marcdump to enable $MARC::Record::DEBUG
        - Added 'Validation' section to MARC::Doc::Tutorial
        - Added append_fields(), insert_fields_after(), 
          insert_fields_before() and deprecated add_fields()
        - Added test of new methods (t/60.insert.t)
        - Updated MARC::Doc::Tutorial to reflect change in add_fields()

0.93    May 21, 2002
        - Added update() and replace_with() methods to MARC::Field
        - Added more stuff to MARC::Doc::Tutorial
        - Added MARC::Doc::Tutorial
        - Changed method call description for as_usmarc() in MARC::Record.
        - Removed IDEA for cloning in MARC::Record docs since it's been done.

0.92    April 2, 2002
        - Fixed marclint to use the new MARC::File object
        - Added MARC::Record::new_from_usmarc() for backward compatibility.
        This is in addition to the MARC::Record::as_usmarc() function.

0.91    April 2, 2002
        - Fixed a bad build: MARC::Batch wasn't included in the tarball.

        - marcdump now takes a --lif parm to be able to dump MicroLIF
        records.

0.90    April 1, 2002
        - Alpha version of what will become MARC::Record 1.00.

        - MAJOR infrastructure changes.  Scripts WILL break.

        - The file-handling has been removed from the MARC::Record class
        and moved into its own MARC::File::* set of classes.

        - First rudimentary MARC::Batch functionality.  This will make
        it easy to handle bunches of files at once without having to
        muck with what file you're on.

        - Now fully embracing all the glory of 5.6+ Perl, such as the
        "our" keyword and $fh filehandles.

0.15    March 19, 2002
        - Added clone() methods for MARC::Field and MARC::Record, so
        you can make a copy of an existing record.  Plus, this acts
        as a filter to create records that are subsets of another.
        
        - Added selective printing of fields in marcdump.  Now you
        can do something like this:

            marcdump myfile.marc --field=245 --field=1XX

        and only get back the title and author fields

0.14    March 7, 2002
        - Added skip_from_file() to read and ignore a record.  It's the
        same as next_from_file(), without the overhead of the parsing.

0.13    November 18, 2001
        - MARC::Lint now squawks if there are inappropriate control
          characters in the data.

0.12    November 13, 2001
        - new_from_microlif() now allows underscores that are embedded in a
          subfield, and ignores any HDR line that gets passed to it.

0.11    November 12, 2001
        - Added inbound microlif support.
        - Added lif2marc program.

0.10    September 27, 2001
        - Correctly updates the base address in the leader.  Thanks to
        Tim Wentz (twentz@mc.net) for finding & fixing.

0.09    August 9, 2001
        - Updated rules from "Understanding MARC" book.
        - Added delete_field() method.

0.08    May 25, 2001
        - Added MARC::Record::title and ::author methods
        - Added the marclint program.
        - Added the rest of the rules for the 5XX tags forward.
        - Made the modules compatible with Perl 5.004.  The exception
          is MARC::Lint, which requires 5.005 because of the qr//
          operator.
        - as_string() methods now return raw strings, without any special
          formatting.  To get the formatted strings from versions <=0.07,
          use as_formatted().

0.07    May 22, 2001
        - Added the rudimentary MARC::Lint module.
        - Added parms to marcdump program

0.06    May 16, 2001
        - Added marcdump program as demo and actual useful code

0.05    May 16, 2001
        - Created t/camel.t as the basis for a test suite. 
        - Removed the MARC::Field::subfields() method
        - Documentation cleanup.

0.04    May 15, 2001
        - Sped up the MARC::Record and MARC::Field constructors about 30%.

0.01    Apr 20, 2001
        - First version.
