Tk-MK version 0.23
==================

Files in Tk-MK are my personal favorite Tk-add-ons. developed in the
past as a side effect of several huge perl projects.


INCLUDED WIDGETS
	Tk::Treeplus        - a Tk::Tree (HList) replacement that supports Sorting,
                          Filtering and Resizing of columns and other gimmicks (e.g. selection history,...)

	Tk::Optionbox       - a nice alternative to the default MenuButton (multi-level selection)
	Tk::PopUpSelectBox  - a dialog based selectionlist alternative to Tk::Optionbox (multi-level selection)
	Tk::Checkbox        - a nice alternative to the standard check-button widget
	Tk::Statusbox       - a view-a-status-by-colors widget with flashing ,...
	Tk::CompoundButton  - extended Tk::Button with ability to show a bitmap/image AND a text label
	Tk::BootSplash      - an improved Splash screen based on Stephen.O.Lidie's Splashscreen.pm


 Implicitely used widgets:
	Tk::HdrResizeButton - an reworked alternative HList-Header-Button (based on Tk::ResizeButton) for resizing
	Tk::ProgressBarPlus - A clone of the std. Progressbar that supports percentage display (was send to Nick-Ing S.,
						  but for time reasons he did not manage to put it in the Tk 805.027 release.
						  Thus as a work-around we have here a renamed clone to avoid namespace conflicts.

 Deprecated/outdated widgets:
	Tk::Buttonplus      - extended Tk::Button with ability to show a bitmap/image AND a text label
	Tk::HListplus       - extended Tk::HList with movable columns based on ResizeButton.pm
