=head1 NAME

annex-to-annex-reinject - use 'git annex reinject' to redo annex-to-annex

=head1 VERSION

version 0.008

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<annex-to-annex-reinject> I<SOURCEANNEX> I<DESTANNEX>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Wrapper around B<git annex reinject --known>, invoked in I<DESTANNEX>,
on the files in the git-annex objects dir of the I<SOURCEANNEX>
(usually I<SOURCEANNEX>/.git/annex/objects).  After reinjecting files,
the git-annex branch of I<SOURCEANNEX> is updated so that it does not
think the content is present there anymore.

Suppose that you use annex-to-annex(1) to migrate files from ~/work to
~/old on your laptop, where each of ~/work and ~/old are git annexes.
Then on your USB backup drive, you can use this script to move the
contents of migrated files from your clone of ~/work to your clone of ~/old:

=over 4

    % annex-to-annex-reinject /media/spwhitton/usb/work /media/spwhitton/usb/old

=back

=head1 OPTIONS

None.
