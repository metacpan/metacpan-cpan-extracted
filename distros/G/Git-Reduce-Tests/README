NAME
    reduce-tests - Create a branch with fewer test files for faster
    development

SYNOPSIS
      reduce-tests \
        --dir=/path/to/git/workdir \
        --include=t/90-load.t,t/91-unload.t \
        --branch=master \
        --prefix=smoke-me \
        --remote=origin \
        --verbose

DESCRIPTION
    reduce-tests is a command-line utility which will be useful in the
    following situation:

    *   You have a Perl library stored in a git repository.

    *   You have a large test suite for that library which takes a
        non-trivial length of time to run.

    *   You wish to run only a subset of those tests.

    reduce-tests enables you to copy a branch, remove files from that
    branch's test suite and run that reduced test suite. The test suite may
    be reduced either by:

    *   Specifying only those test files you wish to include
        ("include=t/firstfile,t/secondfile"); or

    *   Specifying all the test files you wish to exclude
        ("exclude=t/thirdfile,t/fourthfile").

    This program is likely to be particularly useful in the situation where:

    *   You are required to push all branches to a smoke server for testing.

    *   That smoke-testing is activated by prefixing your remote branch with
        a string which your smoke-server recognizes as a request for a smoke
        run.

    *   The smoke server is taking an inordinately long time to complete its
        test runs and/or is reporting failures in test files which you
        cannot reproduce in your development environment (*heisenfails*). If
        you have no immediate control over that smoke server, you can at
        least speed up your development cycle by running only the part of
        the test suite you need to focus on at a given moment.

IMPLEMENTATION
    reduce-tests is implemented by CPAN distribution Git-Reduce-Tests.  The
    minimum version of Perl needed to run this code is 5.6.0.
