SYNOPSIS
            use Tk;
            use Tk::ToolBar;

            my $mw = MainWindow->new;
            my $tb = $mw->ToolBar(qw/-movable 1 -side top
                                     -indicatorcolor blue/);

            $tb->ToolButton  (-text  => 'Button',

                             -tip     => 'back',
                             -command => \&back);
            $tb2->ToolButton(-image   => 'navforward22',
                             -tip     => 'forward',
                             -command => \&forward);
            $tb2->separator;
            $tb2->ToolButton(-image   => 'navhome22',
                             -tip     => 'home',
                             -command => \&home);
            $tb2->ToolButton(-image   => 'actreload22',
                             -tip     => 'reload',
                             -command => \&reload);

            MainLoop;

DESCRIPTION
    This module implements a dockable toolbar. It is in the same spirit as
    the "short-cut" toolbars found in most major applications, such as most
    web browsers and text editors (where you find the "back" or "save" and
    other shortcut buttons).

    Buttons of any type (regular, menu, check, radio) can be created inside
    this widget. You can also create Label, Entry and LabEntry widgets.
    Moreover, the ToolBar itself can be made dockable, such that it can be
    dragged to any edge of your window. Dragging is done in "real-time" so
    that you can see the contents of your ToolBar as you are dragging it.
    Furthermore, if you are close to a stickable edge, a visual indicator
    will show up along that edge to guide you. ToolBars can be made
    "floatable" such that if they are dragged beyond their associated
    window, they will detach and float on the desktop. Also, multiple
    ToolBars are embeddable inside each other.

    If you drag a ToolBar to within 15 pixels of an edge, it will stick to
    that edge. If the ToolBar is further than 15 pixels away from an edge
    and still inside the window, but you release it over another ToolBar
    widget, then it will be embedded inside the second ToolBar. You can
    "un-embed" an embedded ToolBar simply by dragging it out. You can change
    the 15 pixel limit using the -close option.

    Various icons are built into the Tk::ToolBar widget. Those icons can be
    used as images for ToolButtons (see the SYNOPSIS entry elsewhere in this
    document). A demo program is bundled with the module that should be
    available under the 'User Contributed Demonstrations' when you run the
    widget program. Run it to see a list of the available images.

    Tk::ToolBar attempts to use Tk::CursorControl if it's already installed
    on the system. You can further control this using the *-cursorcontrol*
    option. See the PREREQUISITES entry elsewhere in this document.

    The ToolBar is supposed to be created as a child of a Toplevel
    (MainWindow is a Toplevel widget) or a Frame. You are free to experiment
    otherwise, but expect the unexpected :-)

WIDGET-SPECIFIC OPTIONS
    The ToolBar widget takes the following arguments:

    -side
        This option tells the ToolBar what edge to *initially* stick to. Can
        be one of 'top', 'bottom', 'left' or 'right'. Defaults to 'top'.
        This option can be set only during object creation. Default is
        'top'.

    -movable
        This option specifies whether the ToolBar is dockable or not. A
        dockable ToolBar can be dragged around with the mouse to any edge of
        the window, subject to the sticky constraints defined by *-sticky*.
        Default is 1.

    -close
        This option specifies, in pixels, how close we have to drag the
        ToolBar an edge for the ToolBar to stick to it. Default is 15.

    -sticky
        This option specifies which sides the toolbar is allowed to stick
        to. The value must be a string of the following characters 'nsew'. A
        string of 'ns' means that the ToolBar can only stick to the north
        (top) or south (bottom) sides. Defaults to 'nsew'. This option can
        be set only during object creation.

    -in This option allows the toolbar to be embedded within another already
        instantiated Tk::ToolBar object. The value must be a Tk::ToolBar
        object. This option can be set only during object creation.

    -float
        This option specifies whether the toolbar should "float" on the
        desktop if dragged outside of the window. It defaults to 1. Note
        that this value is ignored if *-cursorcontrol* is set to 1.

    -cursorcontrol
        This option specifies whether to use Tk::CursorControl to confine
        the cursor during dragging. The value must be either 1 or 0. The
        default is 1 which checks for Tk::CursorControl and uses it if
        present.

    -mystyle
        This option indicates that you want to control how the ToolBar looks
        like and not rely on Tk::ToolBar's own judgement. The value must be
        either 1 or 0. For now, the only thing this controls is the relief
        of ToolButtons and the borderwidth. Defaults to 0.

    -indicatorcolor
        This option controls the color of the visual indicator that tells
        you whether you are close enough to an edge when dragging the
        ToolBar. Defaults to some shade of blue and green (I like it :P).

    -indicatorrelief
        This option controls the relief of the visual indicator that tells
        you whether you are close enough to an edge when dragging the
        ToolBar. Defaults to flat.

WIDGET METHODS
    The following methods are used to create widgets that are placed inside
    the ToolBar. Widgets are ordered in the same order they are created,
    left to right.

    For all widgets, except Labels, a tooltip can be specified via the -tip
    option. An image can be specified using the -image option for Button-
    and Label-based widgets.

    *$ToolBar*->ToolButton(?-type => *buttonType*,? *options*)
    *$ToolBar*->Button(?-type => *buttonType*,? *options*)
        This method creates a new Button inside the ToolBar. The *-type*
        option can be used to specify what kind of button to create. Can be
        one of 'Button', 'Checkbutton', 'Menubutton', or 'Radiobutton'. A
        tooltip message can be specified via the -tip option. An accelerator
        binding can be specified using the -accelerator option. The value of
        this option is any legal binding sequence as defined in the bind
        manpage. For example, "-accelerator => '<f>'" will invoke the button
        when the 'f' key is pressed. Any other options will be passed
        directly to the constructor of the button. The Button object is
        returned.

    *$ToolBar*->ToolLabel(*options*)
    *$ToolBar*->Label(*options*)
        This method creates a new Label inside the ToolBar. Any options will
        be passed directly to the constructor of the label. The Label object
        is returned.

    *$ToolBar*->ToolEntry(*options*)
    *$ToolBar*->Entry(*options*)
        This method creates a new Entry inside the ToolBar. A tooltip
        message can be specified via the -tip option. Any other options will
        be passed directly to the constructor of the entry. The Entry object
        is returned.

    *$ToolBar*->ToolLabEntry(*options*)
    *$ToolBar*->LabEntry(*options*)
        This method creates a new LabEntry inside the ToolBar. A tooltip
        message can be specified via the -tip option. Any other options will
        be passed directly to the constructor of the labentry. The LabEntry
        object is returned. In horizontal ToolBars, the label of the
        LabEntry widget will be packed to the left of the entry. On vertical
        ToolBars, the label will be packed on top of the entry.

    *$ToolBar*->ToolOptionmenu(*options*)
    *$ToolBar*->Optionmenu(*options*)
        This method creates a new Optionmenu inside the ToolBar. A tooltip
        message can be specified via the -tip option. Any other options will
        be passed directly to the constructor of the Optionmenu. The
        Optionmenu object is returned.

    *$ToolBar*->separator(?-movable => 0/1, -space => num?)
        This method inserts a separator. Separators are movable by default.
        To change that, set the -movable option to 0. If you want to add
        some space to the left of a separator (or at the top if your ToolBar
        is vertical), then you can specify the amount of space (in pixels)
        via the -space option. This can be used to "right-justify" some
        buttons.

IMAGES
    Tk::ToolBar now comes with a set of useful images that can be used in
    your Tk programs. To view those images, run the widget program that is
    bundled with Tk, scroll down to the 'User Contributed Demonstrations',
    and click on the Tk::ToolBar entry.

    Note that the images are created using the text method. Also,
    Tk::ToolBar, upon its creation, pre-loads all of the bundled images into
    memory. This means that those images are available for use in other
    widgets in your Tk program. This also means that unless those images are
    explicitly destroyed, they will use up a small amount of memory even if
    you are not using them explicitly.

    As far as I know, all the bundled images are in the free domain. If that
    is not the case, then please let me know.

BUGS
    Not really a bug, but a feature ;-) The ToolBar widget assumes that you
    use *pack* in its parent. Actually, it will *pack()* itself inside its
    parent. If you are using another geometry manager, then you *MIGHT* get
    some weird behaviour. I have tested it very quickly, and found no
    surprises, but let me know if you do.

    Another thing I noticed is that on slower window managers dragging a
    ToolBar might not go very smoothly, and you can "drop" the ToolBar
    midway through dragging it. I noticed this on Solaris 7 and 8, running
    any of OpenLook, CDE or GNOME2 window managers. I would appreciate any
    reports on different platforms.

TODO
    I have implemented everything I wanted, and then some. Here are things
    that were requested, but are not implemented yet. If you want more, send
    me requests.

    o Allow buttons to be "tied" to menu items. Somewhat taken care of with
    the -accelerator method for buttons.
    o Implement Drag-n-Drop to be able to move Tool* widgets interactively.
    Do we really want this?
PREREQUISITES
    Tk::ToolBar uses only core pTk modules. So you don't need any special
    prerequisites. But, if Tk::CursorControl is installed on your system,
    then Tk::ToolBar will use it to confine the cursor to your window when
    dragging ToolBars (unless you tell it not to).

    Note also that Tk::CursorControl is defined as a prerequisite in
    Makefile.PL. So, during installation you might get a warning saying:

    "Warning: prerequisite Tk::CursorControl failed to load ..."

    if you don't have it installed. You can ignore this warning if you don't
    want to install Tk::CursorControl. Tk::ToolBar will continue to work
    properly.

INSTALLATION
    Either the usual:

            perl Makefile.PL
            make
            make install

    or just stick it somewhere in @INC where perl can find it. It's in pure
    Perl.

    keep me busy: Chris Whiting, Jack Dunnigan, Robert Brooks, Peter
    Lipecka, Martin Thurn and Shahriar Mokhtarzad.

    Also thanks to the various artists of the KDE team for creating those
    great icons, and to Adrian Davis for packaging them in a Tk-friendly
    format.
