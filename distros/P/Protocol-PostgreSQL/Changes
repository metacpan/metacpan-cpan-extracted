	Switch to Mixin::Event::Dispatch for event handling. Now uses ->invoke_event and
	->add_handler_for_event to deal with events, passing on_* callbacks to statement
	handles and db handles is still supported.
	Pass through the statement and portal when building a statement.
	Support ->discard on a statement handle
	Pass through ->debug value rather than setting true/false
	Wait for a startup event before processing queued requests
	Additional events:
	* command_complete now passed through when calling ->prepare_async
	* close_complete supported in statements, with pending queued handlers

	Included some extra callbacks for statements so that we know when it's safe to send data, and provide
	support for the terminate/close requests so we disconnect cleanly.
