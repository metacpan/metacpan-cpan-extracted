NAME

    App::Prove::Plugin::TermTableStty - Set the size of the console for
    Term::Table using stty size

VERSION

    version 0.03

SYNOPSIS

    From command-line:

     prove -PTermTable

    From .proverc:

     -PTermTable

DESCRIPTION

    Some of the Test2::Tools provide some pretty tables for comparing
    deltas from failed tests. It tries to detect the size of the terminal
    so that long lines can be wrapped and the tables remain readable.
    Unfortunately when you run the tests under prove, stdout is redirected
    to a non-terminal and the size of the terminal cannot be detected. This
    plugin will detect the size of the terminal using /dev/tty instead of
    stdout and set the appropriate environment variable so that tables can
    be printed to use the entire terminal diameter.

    I understand why 80 columns is the default for when you do not know the
    size of a terminal, but really who here in 2018 is actually using an 80
    column display? sigh.

    This module is similar to App::Prove::Plugin::TermTableStty but has
    fewer prereqs and requires a platform that supports the stty size
    command.
