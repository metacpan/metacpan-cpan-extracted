Revision history for Perl extension Convert::UUlib.

1.5  Sat Jul 11 03:56:06 CEST 2015
	- fix a heap overflow (testcase by Krzysztof Wojtaś).
        - on systems that support it (posix + mmap + map_anonymous),
          allocate all dynamic areas via mmap and put four guard
          pages around them, to catch similar heap overflows
          safely in the future.
        - find a safer way to pass in CC/CFLAGS to uulib.
        - added stability canary support.

1.4  Sun May 29 17:17:01 CEST 2011
	- avoid a classical buffer overflow in case a progress
          message is too long.
        - this release adds dependencies for snprintf/vsnprintf.
	- some uuencode encoders do not generate a final "space" line
          before the "end" marker, so do not rely on the line to be there.

1.34 Tue Dec 14 22:20:00 CET 2010
	- fix a one-byte-past-end-write buffer overflow in UURepairData
          (reported, analysed and testcase provided by Marco Walther).
	- quoted-printable decoding was completely broken, try a fix.

1.33 Wed Oct 28 09:04:38 CET 2009
	- handle yEnc files with part end=0 and total= more gracefully.
          I wish yEnc had been created by somebody who knows;
          what he does;
          but I doubt he even knows;
          what he did.

1.32 Wed Sep 16 20:07:13 CEST 2009
	- Due to a glitch with CVS, configure lacked executable bits.
          (Quickly reported by Anton Berezin).

1.31 Wed Sep 16 09:04:30 CEST 2009
        - do not use system-replacements for case-insensitive string
          functions when found, as they are broken on too many systems
          (mostly bsds, as usual, but at least some versions of GNU/Linux
          disagree with themselves apparently). Analyzed by Anton Berezin.

1.3 Sat Aug 29 01:24:35 CEST 2009
	- major changes, new bugs and changes in decoding behaviour are
          expected (but not intended).
        - major scanning and decoding speed-up (by a factor of 4),
          by replacing ultra-slow _FP_gets and improving IsKnownHeader
          (but fgets is *still* responsible for >50% if the time).
        - new option OPT_AUTOCHECK to disable O(n) UUCheckGlobalList
          call after every loadfile, majorly speeds up large decodes
          (easily by a factor of 10..100).
        - allow "Smerge -1" to call UUCheckGlobalList.
        - majorly speed up part insertion (still O(n), but much faster).
	- allow for 1023 octet headers instead of the standard
          255 octet ones.
        - support strcasestr, strcasecmp, strncasecmp for added speed.

1.12 Mon Oct 13 14:11:01 CEST 2008
	- use the yencode filesize as additional matching criterium
          to avoid false matches.
        - made the example decoder more verbose w.r.t. error handling.
        - removed potentially confusing decode_temp calls from
          example decoder.

1.11 Fri Jun 13 15:32:30 CEST 2008
	- don't ask.

1.10 Fri Jun 13 14:22:42 CEST 2008
	- fix an infinite-looping problem when scanning in freestyle
          mode (testcase provided by Pieter Geens and Reinhard Pfau).

1.09 Fri May 25 19:38:11 CEST 2007
        - create something sensible, trust a windows program to fuck
          it up: work around literal "(null)" filenames in yenc-encoded
          files.
        - some minor cleanups.

1.08 Sat Dec 16 23:27:13 CET 2006
	- URGENT update, the last release did not
          decode files correctly, usually not at all.
        - my last patch was, of course, completely bogus.
          (sorry. looked simple...).

1.07 Sun Dec 10 17:41:46 CET 2006
	- fixed an uninitialised variable based on analysis
          and patch by Mark Martinec.

1.06 Tue Dec  6 00:56:05 CET 2005
        - fix a number of int/long format errors in the encoding part and
          fix some signed/unsigned char problems of unknown relevance,
          reported by Jonas Smedegaard.
        - new EXPERIMENTAL options OPT_RBUF and OPT_WBUF to set default
          stdio buffer size for reading and writing files.

1.051 Thu Mar  3 18:00:52 CET 2005
	- change of contact address.
        - updated perl parts to GPLv2.

1.05 Fri Feb 25 22:50:27 CET 2005
        - fix a (likely exploitable) segfault problem, (tracked down
          and/or reported by Mark Martinec and Robert Lewis).

1.04 Tue Dec 28 15:08:44 CET 2004
	- slightly improved subject filename extraction.
          Also see the filename callback in the example-decoder.

1.03 Sun Apr 18 22:05:43 CEST 2004
	- upgrade to uudeview-0.5.20, which supposedly fixes a few buffer
          overflows. However, judging from the patch these vulnerabilities
          were not present in the Convert-UUlib version (I might err, though,
          documentation on the actual exploits is scarce).
          As every uudeview update usually brings more instability than stability
          I advise against using this version until it has proven itself
          to be stable, or 1.02 is proven to contain the same buffer overflows.

1.02 Sun Apr 18 16:47:26 CEST 2004
        - renamed crc32 to uulib_crc32, to work around yet another
          shortcoming in this oh-so-outdated macosx.

1.01 Sun Feb  1 19:49:51 CET 2004
	- make it compile with 5.005_03 (reported by Anton Berezin).
        - very short files might not be detected because the header
          parsing code might skip them.

1.0  Thu Nov  6 14:32:08 CET 2003
	- change bracket policy to give priority to (x/y) over (x),
          and use the last bracket found otherwise.
        - part numbers at the end of the subject are now recognized.
        - updated to uulib-0.5.19. Differences and bugfixes kept.

0.31 Wed Oct 16 01:22:34 CEST 2002
	- no internal code changes.
	- much better documentation, now considered "useful".
        - removed the procedural interface.
        - fought the wish to perl-5.8'ify and thus simplify the code :().
        - stress-tested version 0.3 against 70000 data postings since sunday.

0.3   Sun Oct 13 15:12:11 CEST 2002
	- updated to uulib 0.5.18. As expected, some but not all of my bugfixes
          have went into uulib, so the number of differences decreased a bit
          again.
        - I found out that the library is being sold commercially by Frank
          Pilhofer, disregarding the GPL and ignoring the rights of the people
          who sent in patches :(
        - vastly more useful documentation in the .pm file.
        - much smaller distribution filesize ;)

0.213 Sat Jul 27 21:16:30 CEST 2002
	- fixed another buffer overflow, also added a santity check to fgets.

0.212 Sat Apr  6 03:52:13 CEST 2002
        - fix yEnc decoding support.
        - new option OPT_DOTDOT, that makes uulib unescape dot-escaping.
        - increased linelength to 1195.

0.211 Fri Apr  5 23:56:46 CEST 2002
	- *sigh*. new version of uulib, new braindamaged buffer overflows
          fixed. Diffs like "line length 256 => 300" should have
          alerted me...

0.21  Sun Mar 31 22:06:05 CEST 2002
	- bumped uulib from 0.5.15 to 0.5.17 (adds some yEnc support, YENC_ENCODED).
        - source-renamed FP_*-symbols to _FP_* again, but still define them
          to be FP_* in the object file.
        - new callback: SetFileNameCallback (actually documented ;)

0.201 Sun Sep 16 03:43:38 CEST 2001
	- fixed another segfault-bug in uulib, thanks to Lars Hecking who
          provides all the test files ;)

0.2  Thu Jun 14 18:42:49 CEST 2001
        - Frank Pilhofer is NOT dead! He is alive, kicking, and fixing
          bugs in uulib now! Since his uulib and mine diverged quite
          a bit I am still in the process of merging his bugfixes
          into my version. So be aware that this might introduce new
          instabilities...
        - merged uulib-0.5.15
        - optimize decode_file to not copy the file contents when a rename
          succeeds (TMPDIR same disk as destination).
        - updated documentation.

0.111 Fri May  4 22:29:09 CEST 2001
        - heuristic to decode microsoft-rfc822-headers (microsoft uses
          '\' as path seperator which is also the rfc822 quote character.
          of course they could have quoted it, but it's microsoft, so
          only the devil knows how they try to parse mime (they obviously
          haven't read the standard AGAIN). in case you wonder, this fixes
          the "c:my_documentssend.doc" "filename" problem.

0.11  Sun Jul 16 22:42:57 CEST 2000
	- fixed a bug in the file callback.

0.10  Tue May  2 03:31:09 CEST 2000
        - fixed one very longstanding bug that might have been the cause
          for the many mysterious segmentation faults. Hopefully.
        - improved documentation to the point that it slowly becomes useful
          as a (very quick) reference.

0.07  Wed Nov 24 18:45:23 CET 1999
	- removed END { CleanUp } from UUlib.pm, perl is too
          buggy to rely on this in the face of popen etc..

0.06  Thu Jul 29 22:48:18 CEST 1999
	- Thierry Bezecourt had the very reasonable idea to include
          the example source in the manpage.

0.05  Mon May 24 11:37:25 CEST 1999
	- LoadFile returns number of parts loaded.

0.04  Mon May 10 22:02:31 CEST 1999
	- fixed a couple of portability problems.
        - UUEncodeToStream had a wrong definition.
        - added primitive testsuite.
        - added README.

0.03  Sat May  8 22:40:01 CEST 1999
	- renamed it to Convert::UUlib.

0.02  Fri May  7 01:26:19 CEST 1999
	- function names exportable (use :all-tag).
	- made uulist-related functions methods.
        - the first fix from cpan-tester. *sigh* you people save the
          world, continuously.

0.01  Thu May  6 14:30:44 1999
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.19
