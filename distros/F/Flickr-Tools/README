Flickr::Tools
=============

Some of these modules are being integrated with the Flickr::API distribution started by
Cal Henderson. The rest are being reworked to follow more current practice.



A NOTE ON TESTING

For complete testing, some additional information is required from you
(your api_key and secret, for example) which is stored in a storable
formatted config file. Other additional information is in key/value pairs
in the test values file.

make test MAKETEST_OAUTH_CFG=$HOME/oauth-testing.st [TEST_VERBOSE=1]
 MAKETEST_VALUES=$HOME/values_file

There are some simple tools for building these files in the Flickr::API
distribution scripts directory. 


THE MODULES

These modules provide a set of classes that can be used to work with Flickr, 
using it's REST API, as provided by the Flickr::API distribution.

The object of this set of classes is to take the "raw" interface that the 
Flickr::API provides and turn it into a more usable set of objects which 
are easier and faster to use, while providing full access to all the 
functionality provided by Flickr.

This distribution formerly provided two sets of classes:

-> The Flickr::API::* modules (eg: Flickr::API::Photos, Flickr::API::People) 
provide a lower-level way to access the information. They essentially get the 
output from the Flickr::API module and transform in into a cleaner, easier to 
work with hash. These modules are essentially there to be used by the next 
set of modules, but they may be used directly if you should wish to do so.

These modules are moving into Flickr::API distribution.



-> The Flickr::Tools::* modules (eg: Flickr::Tools::Person, Flickr::Tools::Photo)
provide higher-level access to the information on a photo, person, etc. This
is the preferred interface that a typical programmer might choose to use.

These modules are continuing in the Flickr::Tools distribution.



STATUS

This is an early release of the distribution and there are only a limited 
number of methods available at the moment.

Also, this is a "testing the waters" version. I expect the API of the objects 
will change.

Read the TODO file for some of the plans for the future of this distribution. 



INSTALLATION

You probably don't want to install v1.21 of Flickr::Tools, V1.22 may by
marginally useful.
