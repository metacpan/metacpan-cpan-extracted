NAME
    Convert::EastAsianWidth - Convert between full/half-width ASCII
    characters

VERSION
    This document describes version 1.01 of Convert:EastAsianWidth, released
    November 7, 2010.

SYNOPSIS
        # Exports to_fullwidth() and to_halfwidth() by default
        use Convert::EastAsianWidth;

        my $u = to_fullwidth('ABC');            # Full-width variant of 'ABC'
        my $b = to_fullwidth('ABC', 'big5');    # Ditto, but in big5 encoding
        my $x = to_halfwidth($u);               # Gets back 'ABC'
        my $y = to_halfwidth($b, 'big5');       # Same as above

DESCRIPTION
    This module efficiently convert between full- and half-width ASCII
    characters, including alphanumerics and punctuations.

    The first argument is the string to be converted; the second one
    represents the input and encodings. If omitted, both are assumed to be
    Unicode strings.

CAVEATS
    This module does not handle conversion of full/half width katakana,
    which is a slightly more complicated problem because of the need to
    incorporate diacritics.

    Many thanks to BKB for the disclaimer above and for suggesting a more
    efficient conversion algorithm based on "tr///".
