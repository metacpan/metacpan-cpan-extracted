NAME
    DB::Pluggable - Add plugin support for the Perl debugger

SYNOPSIS
        $ cat ~/.perldb
        use DB::Pluggable;
        DB::Pluggable->run_with_config(\<<EOINI)
        [BreakOnTestNumber]

        [TypeAhead]
        type = {l
        type = c
        ifenv = DBTYPEAHEAD

        [StackTraceAsHTML]
        [DataPrinter]
        EOINI

    Then:

        $ perl -d foo.pl

DESCRIPTION
    This class adds plugin support to the Perl debugger. It is based on
    Brickyard, so see its documentation for details.

    You need to have a "~/.perldb" file (see perldebug for details) that
    invokes the plugin mechanism.

    Plugins should live in the "DB::Pluggable::Plugin::" namespace, like
    DB::Pluggable::Plugin::BreakOnTestNumber does.

METHODS
  run_with_config
    Convenience class method to create, initialize and run the plugin system
    with the given configuration file or scalar reference.

  plugins_with
    Like the method with the same name in Brickyard.

  init_from_config
    Like the method with the same name in Brickyard.

  enable_watchfunction
    Tells the debugger to call "DB::watchfunction()", which in turn calls
    the "watchfunction()" method of all plugins that consume the
    "-WatchFunction" role.

  run
    This method just calls the "initialize()" method of all plugins that
    consume the "-Initializer" role.

Plugin Phases
    This class is very much in beta, so it's more like a proof of concept.
    Therefore, not all roles - which more or less correspond to plugin
    phases - imaginable have been added, only the ones to make this demo
    work. If you want more roles or if the current roles don't work for you,
    let me know.

    The following roles exist:

    "-Initializer"
        See DB::Pluggable::Role::Initializer.

    "-WatchFunction"
        See DB::Pluggable::Role::WatchFunction.

    "-AfterInit"
        See DB::Pluggable::Role::AfterInit.

    "-Eval"
        See DB::Pluggable::Role::Eval. The debugger's "eval()" function is
        overridden so we can make it pluggable. Each plugin will get a
        chance to inspect the command line, which is the last line in
        $DB::evalarg and act on it. The plugin can return a code reference
        which will be executed after the original "DB::eval()" function has
        finished. Using the code reference you can undo any temporary
        changes you might have introduced to make your command work.
