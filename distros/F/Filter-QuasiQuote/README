NAME
    Filter::QuasiQuote - Quasiquoting for Perl

VERSION
    This document describes Filter::QuasiQuote 0.07 released on August 20,
    2008.

SYNOPSIS
        package MyFilter;

        require Filter::QuasiQuote;
        our @ISA = qw( Filter::QuasiQuote );

        sub my_filter {
            my ($self, $s, $file, $line, $col) = @_;
            # parse the dsl source in $s and emit the perl source in ONE LINE
            return generate_perl_source( parse_dsl( $s ) );
        }

        # and in another file:
        use MyFilter;

        [:my_filter|This is my little DSL...|]

DESCRIPTION
    GHC 6.10.x is going to have a nice quasiquoting feature for Haskell:

    <http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~mainland/ghc-quasiquoting/>

    This module implements similar quasiquoting syntax for Perl by means of
    carefully designed source filters.

    The user can subclass "Filter::QuasiQuote" and define her own DSL
    extensions. Besides, multiple concrete quasiquoting filters can be
    chained and composed within a single Perl file.

    Special efforts have been made to ensure line numbers for the resulting
    Perl source won't be corrupted and support for precise file position
    information is also provided to user's DSL compilers as well.

    This work is still in alpha phase and under active development. So
    please check back often ;)

EXAMPLES
    SQL auto-quoter
        The concrete filter class could be defined as follows:

            # QuoteSQL.pm
            package QuoteSQL;

            require Filter::QuasiQuote;
            our @ISA = qw( Filter::QuasiQuote );

            sub sql {
                my ($self, $s, $file, $line, $col) = @_;
                my $package = ref $self;
                #warn "SQL: $file: $line: $s\n";
                $s =~ s/\n+/ /g;
                $s =~ s/^\s+|\s+$//g;
                $s =~ s/\\/\\\\/g;
                $s =~ s/"/\\"/g;
                $s =~ s/\$\w+\b/".${package}::Q($&)."/g;
                $s = qq{"$s"};
                $s =~ s/\.""$//;
                $s;
            }

            sub Q {
                my $s = shift;
                $s =~ s/'/''/g;
                $s =~ s/\\/\\\\/g;
                $s =~ s/\n/ /g;
                "'$s'";
            }

            1;

        And then use it this way:

            use QuoteSQL;

            my $sql = [:sql|
                select id, title
                from posts
                where id = $id and title = $title |];

        which is actually equivalent to

            my ($id, $title) = (32, 'Hello');
            my $sql =
                "select id, title from posts where id = ".quote($id);

INTERNAL METHODS
    The following methods are internal and are not intended to call
    directly.

    debug
        Used to print debug info to stderr when $Filter::QuasiQuote::Debug
        is set to 1.

    filter
        Main filter function which is usually inherited by concrete filter
        subclasses.

CAVEATS
    Subclasses of "Filter::QuasiQuote" should NOT use it directly. For
    example, the following will break things:

        use Filter::QuasiQuote; # BAD!!!
        use base 'Filter::QuasiQuote'; # BAD TOO!!!

    Because One should never call the "import" method of Filter::QuasiQuote
    directly. (Perl's "use" statement calls its "import" automatically while
    the "require" statement does not.)

TODO
    *   Use Module::Compile's .pmc trick to cache the filters' results onto
        disks.
