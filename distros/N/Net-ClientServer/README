NAME
    Net::ClientServer - A client/server platform for IPC on localhost

VERSION
    version 0.0007

SYNOPSIS
    The minimum configuration (specify a port):

        my $platform = Net::ClientServer->new( port => 8020 );

        $platform->server_socket;

        ...

        if ( $platform->started ) { # Will attempt to connect to the listening socket
            $platform->client_socket;
        }

    Save server state to disk:

        $platform = Net::ClientServer->new( port => 8020, name => 'net-client-server' );
        # Server pid will be stored in $HOME/.net-client-server/pid
        # On daemonization, stderr will be outputted to $HOME/.net-client-server/stderr

    With a basic startup & serve/accept routine:

        my $port = 8020;
        $platform = Net::ClientServer->new(
            port => $port,
            start => sub {
                print STDERR "Server listening on $port\n";
            },
            serve => sub {
                my $client = shift; # The client socket
                $client->print( "Hello, World.\n" );
            },
        );

        $platform->start;

DESCRIPTION
    Net::ClientServer is a tool for implementing a basic client/server
    architecture using a single platform (particularly useful when doing IPC
    on the localhost). It is easily configured for daemonizing and
    maintaining state on disk (pidfile & stderr).

    The minimum configuration is very simple, requiring only a port number:

        my $platform = Net::ClientServer->new( port => 8020 );
        $platform->server_socket;

        ...

        $platform->client_socket;

USAGE
  $platform = Net::ClientServer->new( ... )
        port                The port to listen on/connect to

        host                The host to listen on/connect to, 'localhost' by default

        name                The name of the platform. If given without specifying the
                            home parameter, then pidfile and stderr will be put in
                            ~/.$name/

        home                The home directory for the platform. The pidfile and stderr will be
                            placed in this directory

        pidfile             The name of the pidfile, 'pid' by default.

        stderr              The name of file to output stderr to, 'stderr' by default

    If neither "home" nor "name" are given, then a pidfile and stderr file
    will not be generated

  $platform->start
    Start the server if it is not already running

  $platform->started
    Return true if the server is running. If a pidfile is available, then it
    will check to see that the process is running. If a pidfile is
    unavailable, or the process does not seem to be running, it will check
    to see if it can connect to the server
