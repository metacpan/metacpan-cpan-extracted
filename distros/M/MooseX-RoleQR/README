NAME
    MooseX::RoleQR - allow "before qr{...} => sub {...};" in roles

SYNOPSIS
       {
          package Local::Role;
          use MooseX::RoleQR;
          after qr{^gr} => sub {
             print " World\n";
          };
       }
   
       {
          package Local::Class;
          use Moose;
          with qw( Local::Role );
          sub greet {
             print "Hello";
          }
       }
   
       Local::Class->new->greet; # prints "Hello World\n"

DESCRIPTION
    Method modifiers in Moose classes can be specified using regular
    expressions a la:

       before qr{...} => sub {...};

    However, this is not allowed in Moose roles because Moose doesn't know
    which class the role will be composed with, and thus doesn't know which
    method names match the regular expression. Let's change that.

    This module implements regular expression matched method modifiers for
    Moose roles. It does so by deferring the calculation of which methods to
    modify until role application time.

    The current implementation handles only `before`, `after` and `around`
    modifiers (not `override`), and thus it overrides the following standard
    Moose::Role keywords:

    `before Str|ArrayRef|RegexpRef => CodeRef`
    `after Str|ArrayRef|RegexpRef => CodeRef`
    `around Str|ArrayRef|RegexpRef => CodeRef`

  Caveat Regarding the Order of Method Modifiers
    Moose executes method modifiers in a well-defined order (see
    Moose::Manual::MethodModifiers for details). This module has the potential
    to disrupt that order, as regular expression matched modifiers are always
    applied after the role's other modifiers have been applied.

  Caveat: no `use Moose::Role`
    You should `use MooseX::RoleQR` *instead of* Moose::Role; not *as well
    as*.

  General Caveat
    There's some pretty nasty stuff under the hood. Let's pretend it's not
    there.
