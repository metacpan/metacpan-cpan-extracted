        * Fixed dependencies; s/JSON/JSON::XS/

        * No longer accepts params to the login() method; use accessor
          methods instead.
        * Now uses JSON_XS which, allegedly, fixes problems with
          string-to-integer conversions (in response to discussion on
          freebase mailing list)
        * Removed some diagnostic print statements that shouldn't have
          been there in the first place, really
        * Included examples/ directory in dist
        * Updated documentation significantly
        * See blog post at
          http://infotrope.net/blog/2007/09/09/a-quick-tour-of-freebase/
          for a quick tour of Freebase including use of this module.

0.03    2007-09-09
        * Previous version was missing the command line tool, 'metaweb'.
          This has now been added to the MANIFEST so it should install
          correctly.

0.02    2007-08-24
        * Now includes 'metaweb' command line script for easy command line
          fiddling.
        * json_query() now does writes as well as reads; query() doesn't
          support writes yet, though.
        * Changed API for json_query().  Now expects envelope (though
          you can have it added for you it using the add_envelope arg).
        * Documentation improvements, mostly in the general description area.
