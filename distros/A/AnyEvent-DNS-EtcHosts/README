NAME
    AnyEvent::DNS::EtcHosts - Use /etc/hosts before DNS

SYNOPSIS
      use AnyEvent::DNS::EtcHosts;

      use AnyEvent::DNS;
      my $cv = AE::cv;
      AnyEvent::DNS::any 'example.com', sub {
          say foreach map { $_->[4] } grep { $_->[1] =~ /^(a|aaaa)$/ } @_;
          $cv->send;
      };

      use AnyEvent::Socket;
      my $cv = AE::cv;
      AnyEvent::Socket::resolve_sockaddr $domain, $service, $proto, $family, undef, sub {
          say foreach map { format_address((AnyEvent::Socket::unpack_sockaddr($_->[3]))[1]) } @_;
          $cv->send;
      };

DESCRIPTION
    AnyEvent::DNS::EtcHosts changes AnyEvent::DNS behavior. The /etc/hosts
    file is searched before DNS, so it is possible to override DNS entries.

    The DNS lookups are emulated. This resolver returns the standard DNS
    reply based on /etc/hosts file rather than real DNS.

    You can choose different file by changing `PERL_ANYEVENT_HOSTS'
    environment variable.

    This module also disables original AnyEvent::Socket's helper function
    which reads /etc/hosts file after DNS entry was not found. It prevents
    to read this file twice.

    The AnyEvent::Socket resolver searches IPv4 and IPv6 addresses
    separately. If you don't want to check the addresses in DNS, both IPv4
    and IPv6 addresses should be placed in /etc/hosts or the protocol family
    should be set explicitly for `resolve_sockaddr' function.

SEE ALSO
    AnyEvent::DNS, AnyEvent::Socket.

BUGS
    This module might be incompatible with further versions of AnyEvent
    module.
