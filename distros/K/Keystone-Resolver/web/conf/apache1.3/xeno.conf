# This is an Apache 1.3 configuration file, to be dropped into the
# conf.d directory of a mod_perl-enabled server.  The exact location
# of the conf.d directory will be different depending on your
# operating system, but --
#
# On Red Hat 9 and probably all Red Hat-based Linuxes it's:
#	/etc/httpd/conf.d
# On Ubuntu 6.06 and probably all Debian-based Linuxes it's:
#	/etc/apache/conf.d/
#
# So, for example, on a Ubuntu 6.06 system:
#	cd /etc/apache/conf.d
#	sudo ln -s /usr/local/src/cvs/openurl-resolver/web/conf/apache1.3/xeno.conf resolver.conf
#	sudo ln -s /usr/local/src/cvs/openurl-resolver/web/conf/apache1.3/xeno.conf resolver.conf
#	sudo apachectl restart
#
# This file does not need to be owned by root, so long as it's placed
# in the root-owned configuration directory.
