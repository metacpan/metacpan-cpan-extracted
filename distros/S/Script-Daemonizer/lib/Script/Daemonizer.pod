=head1 NAME

Script::Daemonizer - Daemonize; handle signals, logs, pidfile and locks.

=head1 VERSION

Version 1.01.01

Interface changed from procedural to OO across 0.92-0.93 transition.


=head1 SYNOPSIS

    # Want a quickstart? Do this:

    use Script::Daemonizer;
    ...
    Script::Daemonizer->new()->daemonize();


=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module turns your script into a UNIX daemon by requiring as little
modification as possible, thus letting you concentrate on solving
your problem, rather than on writing a daemon.

This module also provides some facilities to manage logging, restarting (on
SIGHUP by default) and preventing multiple instances to run at once (by locking
a pidfile).

Default and optional steps can be customized by passing arguments to new() (see
L</ADVANCED USAGE> for details).


daemonize() is the main routine of this module. What it does, out-of-the-box,
is:

=over 4

=item 1.* it sets umask() to 0. You must then set explicitly file and
directory permissions upon creating them, restore umask() after initialization,
or specify I<umask> option (see L</ADVANCED USAGE> for details).

=item 2.* it calls fork(), then the parent exits;

=item 3.* it calls POSIX::setsid() (see L<POSIX::setsid()>), so the process becomes session leader;

=item 4.* it calls fork() again, then the parent exits;

=item 5.* it changes its working directory to "/";

=item 6.* NO LONGER IMPLEMENTED (since 0.93.00) - closing file descriptors.
It's practically impossible, so this step has been removed.

=item 7.* it ties STDOUT and STDERR to Syslog using  C<Tie::Syslog> (if
available, otherwise it reopens them on /dev/null) so that all output is
logged to syslog (see L<Tie::Syslog>); open STDIN on /dev/null.

=back

Steps marked by * are configurable; some additional steps are also available if
explicitly requested; see L</ADVANCED USAGE> for details.



=head1 SUPPORTED PLATFORMS

All UNIX and UNIX-like operating systems (or so should be). Please open a BUG
if you find it's not so.



=head1 ADVANCED USAGE

I strive to make this module support "standard" daemon features
out-of-the-box (for some definition of "standard"). Some of these features can
be configured, and some other are enabled only if configured.

=head2 ADVANCED SYNOPSYS

Advanced configuration syntax is the following:

    use Script::Daemonizer;

    my $daemon = new Script::Daemonizer (
        name            => "My wonderful new daemon",  # tag for logging
        umask           => $my_umask,                  # set umask to $my_umask
        working_dir     => "/var/ftp",                 # try to chdir here
        drop_privileges => {                           # call drop_privileges()
            uid  => $to_uid,
            gid  => $to_gid,
            # and others, see drop_privileges() method description
        },
        setsid          => 'SKIP',                     # skip POSIX::setsid() call
        fork            => 2,                          # for # number of times (0, 1 or 2)
        pidfile         => '/var/run/mydaemon.pid',    # write and lock this pidfile
        output_file     => '/var/log/mydaemon.log',    # redirect stdout/stderr here
        restart_on      => [ 'HUP', 'QUIT' ],          # restart on these signals
    );

    # To make stdout/stderr go to different places, use these:
    my $daemon = new Script::Daemonizer (
        ...
        stdout_file     => '/log/mydaemon.log',
        stderr_file     => '/log/mydaemon.err',
    );


    # if you did not specify drop_privileges in configuration, you can still
    # do it afterwards:
    $daemon->drop_privileges(
        uid  => $to_uid,
        gid  => $to_gid,
    );

    ###########################################################################

    # IMPORT TAGS

    # Will skip chdir(), unless you pass 'working_dir' to new()
    use Script::Daemonizer qw(:NOCHDIR);

    # Will skip umask(), unless you pass 'umask' to new()
    use Script::Daemonizer qw(:NOUMASK);


=head2 OPTIONAL ACTIONS

Some options have no default and thus corresponding actions are skipped if not
configured. These are:

=over 4

=item * Step 0.0 - privileges dropping

It happens before anything else. This simply calls drop_privileges() internally.

=item * Step 4.5 - pidfile creation (and locking)

This implicitly provides a method to ensure that only one copy of your daemon
is running at once, because pidfile is locked.

=item * Handling of SIGHUP (and maybe other signals) as a restart() trigger

See B<< restart_on >> parameter.

=back


=head2 IMPORT TAGS

Starting from 0.93.4, you can suppress some default actions by importing
Script::Daemonizer with the corresponding tag:

=over 4

=item :NOCHDIR - will skip the chdir to '/'

=item :NOUMASK - will skip setting umask to 0

=back


=head1 METHODS

=head2 new()

Creates a new instance of a Script::Daemonizer object. If you just want to start
with defaults, just call it with no args:

    # A new daemon
    my $daemon = Script::Daemonizer->new();

To customize your daemon see L</ADVANCED USAGE>.


=head2 daemonize()

It runs through all the steps required to send your program to background as a
daemon. Its behavior varies depending on options specified to L</new>.

=head2 drop_privileges()

    # Just drop effective user/group id:
    $daemon->drop_privileges(
        euid => $to_euid,
        egid => $to_egid,
        # or by name
        euser  => $to_euser,
        egroup => $to_egroup,
    );

    # Drop both effective and real ids:
    $daemon->drop_privileges(
        uid  => $to_uid,
        gid  => $to_gid,
        # or by name
        user  => $to_user,
        group => $to_group,
    );

Tries to drop privileges to given EUID/EGID or UID/GID (single (e)uid/(e)gid
allowed). Since 1.00 also names are allowed.
See L<perldoc perlvar> for details on IDs.

daemonize() will automatically call drop_privileges() if configured to do so
(guess what? See L</ADVANCED USAGE> for details) but this will happen
B<before> anything else (think of this as step 0). If you need to drop
privileges at a later moment, do not pass the C<< drop_privileges >> parameter
to new() and use the drop_privileges() method, otherwise it's probably
safer to do so while daemonize()-ing.

=head2 restart()

restart() is there to let you restart completely the daemon. A simple way to
handle SIGHUP might be restarting, for example (see
L<perlipc|http://perldoc.perl.org/perlipc.html#Handling-the-SIGHUP-Signal-in-Daemons>
for details).

    # Restart upon sighup - use a closure to call restart()
    $SIG{HUP} = sub {
        $daemon->restart;
    };

Please B<< NOTE >> that with the B<< restart_on >> parameter this setup is done
automatically.

B<pidfile> (see L</ADVANCED USAGE> for details) is kept open
upon restart (if configured), but on some platforms (see L</Concerning locks>
for details) the lock is not preserved, so a race condition may still happen.

You can pass command line args to restart() to modify command line on-the-fly:

    use Script::Daemonizer;
    ...
    unless( some_condition_on(@ARGV) ) {
        # Do some mangling on @ARGV
        ...
        $daemon->restart(@my_modified_argv);
    }

The defaul is to use a copy of @ARGV taken at compile-time (before any
command-line-parsing modifies @ARGV, for example).

=head2 sigunmask()

    $daemon->sigunmask( @signals );

Strictly related to restart(), sigunmask() is there to let you unmask signals
without pain. See L<http://docstore.mik.ua/orelly/perl4/cook/ch17_19.htm>
for details on why you should unmask signals. In short: inside a signal handler
the signal that triggered the handler is blocked. If inside a signal handler you
re-exec() yourself, the new process inherits the blocked signal. That is why
you'll want to unmask that signal after a new start.

B<SGIHUP is unmasked by default>, just by saying C<use Script::Daemonizer>.

If you use restart() with other signals, remember to unmask them:

    # Restart on SIGHUP, SIGQUIT and SIGUSR1
    for my $nal in (qw/HUP QUIT USR1/) {
        $SIG{$nal} = sub {
            $daemon->restart;
        }
    }

    # Just in case we came from another instance of ourselves via an exec()
    # (no need to bother for SIGHUP since we unmask it by default, anyway
    # listing it here is harmless):

    $daemon->sigunmask(qw{QUIT USR1});

B<< or use C<< restart_on >> to handle this automatically>>.



=head1 ADVANCED OPTIONS

These are all parameter you can pass to new(). Advanced options are the
following:


=head2 B<name>

Sets the name of the daemon. This is used for logging.

I<default>: script name, got from $0, split on system path separator;

=head2 B<fork>

How many times do you want to fork?

=over 4

=item -) 0 - perform no fork()

=item -) 1 - do it just once

=item -) 2 - fork twice

=item -) * any other value will result in a fork()-twice

=back

I<default>: fork() twice.


=head2 B<output_file>

Redirect both STDOUT and STDERR on the file specified (appending by default).
'/dev/null' will be converted to File::Spec->devnull (see L<File::Spec>);
Tie::Syslog will be skipped completely. E.g.:

    output_file => '/dev/null',


=head2 B<pidfile>

This will try to:

=over 4

=item - open named pidfile, creating it if non-existent;

=item - lock it (exclusively);

=back

If this operation fails, daemonize() will croak(). Otherwise, PID of the process
will be written to the named pidfile after the last fork() is done.

    Script::Daemonizer::daemonize(
        name    => 'A new daemon',
        pidfile => '/var/run/anewdaemon.pid',
    );

This lock mechanism provides the following advantages:

=over 4

=item * no other instances of the same daemon will overwrite the pidfile on
purpose;

=item * the pid file will serve as a lock file, ensuring no other instances of
the same daemon will start;

=item * an C<fuser> (see L<fuser(1)>) on the pidfile will reveal the daemon's pid. If
the daemon is not running, the pidfile will not be in use by any process
(hopefully). A simple:

    $ fuser -k $PIDFILE

will end up killing the daemon (or provides an easy way to signal the daemon).

=back

=head2 B<restart_on>

This is a ArrayRef of signal names (without the SIG- prefix) that will
trigger the restart() method automatically. Signal masking is handled, too, so
you'll want to use this to handle restarts. E.g.:

    restart_on => [ 'HUP', 'QUIT' ],    # trigger restart() on SIGHUP and SIGQUIT


=head2 B<setsid>

The only accepted value is I<SKIP>. Set this to skip setsid().


=head2 B<stdout_file>

Redirect STDOUT on the file specified (appending by default). '/dev/null' will
be converted to File::Spec->devnull (see L<File::Spec>); Tie::Syslog will not be
used for STDOUT.

=head2 B<stderr_file>

Redirect STDERR on the file specified (appending by default). '/dev/null' will
be converted to File::Spec->devnull (see L<File::Spec>); Tie::Syslog will not be
used for STDERR.

=head2 B<umask>

Set the specified umask.

default: 0
Setting umask can be suppressed using the C<< :NOUMASK >> import tag.

=head2 B<working_dir>

Try to chdir() to the specified directory.

default: root (/) dir.
chdir() can be suppressed using the C<< :NOCHDIR >> import tag.

=head1 LOCKING

If you want to be sure no multiple instances of your daemon will be running,
just use I<pidfile> advanced option. See L</pidfile> for details.


=head1 CAVEATS

=head2 Concerning filehandles

Filehandles cannot really be closed. Following advice from Matt S. Trout I will
skip filehandle-closing step completely.


=head2 Concerning locks

On some platforms (by now only Solaris is proven to be affected, but other
platforms may be) the lock on the pidfile is not preserved across fork().

Starting with v1.01.00 the pidfile is created and locked after the last fork(),
this should solve the various issues with different platforms.



=head1 FAQ

=head2 Q: Why is there no built-in start/stop/* method?

A: Because to start/stop/* a daemon you usually don't call the daemon itself,
instead you rely on system tools that allow process control (if you need an
S<< "init script" >> then write one) and interact with processes through signals.
Lack of start/stop/* methods is regarded as a feature.
B<< Tyr L<< Daemon::Control >> if you're looking for such an interface >>
(it cal also generate init scripts).

=head2 Q: Why is Tie::Syslog not listed as prerequisites?

A: Because you may want to skip Syslog support and not install that
module. Script::Daemonizer module will work nonetheless, without using
Tie::Syslog them (and without the features it provides, of course).


=head1 TODO

Some ideas:

=over 4

=item * Let user set her own options for tied STDOUT/STDERR (i.e. logopt for
syslog (see L<Sys::Syslog>), facility, priority).

=item * Provide a function to automatically parse command line (via
L<Getopt::Long|Getopt::Long>).

=item * Provide a function to automatically handle configuration file (via
L<Config::General|Config::General>).
