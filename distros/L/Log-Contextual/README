NAME
    Log::Contextual - Simple logging interface with a contextual log

VERSION
    version 0.008001

SYNOPSIS
     use Log::Contextual qw( :log :dlog set_logger with_logger );
     use Log::Contextual::SimpleLogger;
     use Log::Log4perl ':easy';
     Log::Log4perl->easy_init($DEBUG);

     my $logger  = Log::Log4perl->get_logger;

     set_logger $logger;

     log_debug { 'program started' };

     sub foo {

       my $minilogger = Log::Contextual::SimpleLogger->new({
         levels => [qw( trace debug )]
       });

       my @args = @_;

       with_logger $minilogger => sub {
         log_trace { 'foo entered' };
         my ($foo, $bar) = Dlog_trace { "params for foo: $_" } @args;
         # ...
         slog_trace 'foo left';
       };
     }

     foo();

    Beginning with version 1.008 Log::Dispatchouli also works out of the box
    with "Log::Contextual":

     use Log::Contextual qw( :log :dlog set_logger );
     use Log::Dispatchouli;
     my $ld = Log::Dispatchouli->new({
        ident     => 'slrtbrfst',
        to_stderr => 1,
        debug     => 1,
     });

     set_logger $ld;

     log_debug { 'program started' };

DESCRIPTION
    Major benefits:

    * Efficient

      The default logging functions take blocks, so if a log level is
      disabled, the block will not run:

       # the following won't run if debug is off
       log_debug { "the new count in the database is " . $rs->count };

      Similarly, the "D" prefixed methods only "Dumper" the input if the
      level is enabled.

    * Handy

      The logging functions return their arguments, so you can stick them in
      the middle of expressions:

       for (log_debug { "downloading:\n" . join qq(\n), @_ } @urls) { ... }

    * Generic

      "Log::Contextual" is an interface for all major loggers. If you log
      through "Log::Contextual" you will be able to swap underlying loggers
      later.

    * Powerful

      "Log::Contextual" chooses which logger to use based on user defined
      "CodeRef"s. Normally you don't need to know this, but you can take
      advantage of it when you need to later.

    * Scalable

      If you just want to add logging to your basic application, start with
      Log::Contextual::SimpleLogger and then as your needs grow you can
      switch to Log::Dispatchouli or Log::Dispatch or Log::Log4perl or
      whatever else.

    This module is a simple interface to extensible logging. It exists to
    abstract your logging interface so that logging is as painless as
    possible, while still allowing you to switch from one logger to another.

    It is bundled with a really basic logger, Log::Contextual::SimpleLogger,
    but in general you should use a real logger instead. For something more
    serious but not overly complicated, try Log::Dispatchouli (see
    "SYNOPSIS" for example.)

A WORK IN PROGRESS
    This module is certainly not complete, but we will not break the
    interface lightly, so I would say it's safe to use in production code.
    The main result from that at this point is that doing:

     use Log::Contextual;

    will die as we do not yet know what the defaults should be. If it turns
    out that nearly everyone uses the ":log" tag and ":dlog" is really rare,
    we'll probably make ":log" the default. But only time and usage will
    tell.

IMPORT OPTIONS
    See "SETTING DEFAULT IMPORT OPTIONS" for information on setting these
    project wide.

  -logger
    When you import this module you may use "-logger" as a shortcut for
    "set_logger", for example:

     use Log::Contextual::SimpleLogger;
     use Log::Contextual qw( :dlog ),
       -logger => Log::Contextual::SimpleLogger->new({ levels => [qw( debug )] });

    sometimes you might want to have the logger handy for other stuff, in
    which case you might try something like the following:

     my $var_log;
     BEGIN { $var_log = VarLogger->new }
     use Log::Contextual qw( :dlog ), -logger => $var_log;

  -levels
    The "-levels" import option allows you to define exactly which levels
    your logger supports. So the default, "[qw(debug trace warn info error
    fatal)]", works great for Log::Log4perl, but it doesn't support the
    levels for Log::Dispatch. But supporting those levels is as easy as
    doing

     use Log::Contextual
       -levels => [qw( debug info notice warning error critical alert emergency )];

  -package_logger
    The "-package_logger" import option is similar to the "-logger" import
    option except "-package_logger" sets the logger for the current package.

    Unlike "-default_logger", "-package_logger" cannot be overridden with
    "set_logger" or "with_logger".

     package My::Package;
     use Log::Contextual::SimpleLogger;
     use Log::Contextual qw( :log ),
       -package_logger => Log::Contextual::WarnLogger->new({
          env_prefix => 'MY_PACKAGE'
       });

    If you are interested in using this package for a module you are putting
    on CPAN we recommend Log::Contextual::WarnLogger for your package
    logger.

  -default_logger
    The "-default_logger" import option is similar to the "-logger" import
    option except "-default_logger" sets the default logger for the current
    package.

    Basically it sets the logger to be used if "set_logger" is never called;
    so

     package My::Package;
     use Log::Contextual::SimpleLogger;
     use Log::Contextual qw( :log ),
       -default_logger => Log::Contextual::WarnLogger->new({
          env_prefix => 'MY_PACKAGE'
       });

SETTING DEFAULT IMPORT OPTIONS
    Eventually you will get tired of writing the following in every single
    one of your packages:

     use Log::Log4perl;
     use Log::Log4perl ':easy';
     BEGIN { Log::Log4perl->easy_init($DEBUG) }

     use Log::Contextual -logger => Log::Log4perl->get_logger;

    You can set any of the import options for your whole project if you
    define your own "Log::Contextual" subclass as follows:

     package MyApp::Log::Contextual;

     use base 'Log::Contextual';

     use Log::Log4perl ':easy';
     Log::Log4perl->easy_init($DEBUG)

     sub arg_default_logger { $_[1] || Log::Log4perl->get_logger }
     sub arg_levels { [qw(debug trace warn info error fatal custom_level)] }
     sub default_import { ':log' }

     # or maybe instead of default_logger
     sub arg_package_logger { $_[1] }

     # and almost definitely not this, which is only here for completeness
     sub arg_logger { $_[1] }

    Note the "$_[1] ||" in "arg_default_logger". All of these methods are
    passed the values passed in from the arguments to the subclass, so you
    can either throw them away, honor them, die on usage, etc. To be clear,
    if you define your subclass, and someone uses it as follows:

     use MyApp::Log::Contextual -default_logger => $foo,
                                -levels => [qw(bar baz biff)];

    Your "arg_default_logger" method will get $foo and your "arg_levels"
    will get "[qw(bar baz biff)]";

    Additionally, the "default_import" method is what happens if a user
    tries to use your subclass with no arguments. The default just dies, but
    if you'd like to change the default to import a tag merely return the
    tags you'd like to import. So the following will all work:

     sub default_import { ':log' }

     sub default_import { ':dlog' }

     sub default_import { qw(:dlog :log ) }

    See Log::Contextual::Easy::Default for an example of a subclass of
    "Log::Contextual" that makes use of default import options.

FUNCTIONS
  set_logger
     my $logger = WarnLogger->new;
     set_logger $logger;

    Arguments: "LOGGER CODEREF"

    "set_logger" will just set the current logger to whatever you pass it.
    It expects a "CodeRef", but if you pass it something else it will wrap
    it in a "CodeRef" for you. "set_logger" is really meant only to be
    called from a top-level script. To avoid foot-shooting the function will
    warn if you call it more than once.

  with_logger
     my $logger = WarnLogger->new;
     with_logger $logger => sub {
        if (1 == 0) {
           log_fatal { 'Non Logical Universe Detected' };
        } else {
           log_info  { 'All is good' };
        }
     };

    Arguments: "LOGGER CODEREF", "CodeRef $to_execute"

    "with_logger" sets the logger for the scope of the "CodeRef"
    $to_execute. As with "set_logger", "with_logger" will wrap
    $returning_logger with a "CodeRef" if needed.

  has_logger
     my $logger = WarnLogger->new;
     set_logger $logger unless has_logger;

    Arguments: none

    "has_logger" will return true if a logger has been set.

  log_$level
    Import Tag: ":log"

    Arguments: "CodeRef $returning_message, @args"

    "log_$level" functions all work the same except that a different method
    is called on the underlying $logger object. The basic pattern is:

     sub log_$level (&@) {
       if ($logger->is_$level) {
         $logger->$level(shift->(@_));
       }
       @_
     }

    Note that the function returns it's arguments. This can be used in a
    number of ways, but often it's convenient just for partial inspection of
    passthrough data

     my @friends = log_trace {
       'friends list being generated, data from first friend: ' .
         Dumper($_[0]->TO_JSON)
     } generate_friend_list();

    If you want complete inspection of passthrough data, take a look at the
    "Dlog_$level" functions.

    Which functions are exported depends on what was passed to "-levels".
    The default (no "-levels" option passed) would export:

    log_trace
    log_debug
    log_info
    log_warn
    log_error
    log_fatal
      Note: "log_fatal" does not call "die" for you, see "EXCEPTIONS AND
      ERROR HANDLING"

  slog_$level
    Mostly the same as "log_$level", but expects a string as first argument,
    not a block. Arguments are passed through just the same, but since it's
    just a string, interpolation of arguments into it must be done manually.

     my @friends = slog_trace 'friends list being generated.', generate_friend_list();

  logS_$level
    Import Tag: ":log"

    Arguments: "CodeRef $returning_message, Item $arg"

    This is really just a special case of the "log_$level" functions. It
    forces scalar context when that is what you need. Other than that it
    works exactly same:

     my $friend = logS_trace {
       'I only have one friend: ' .  Dumper($_[0]->TO_JSON)
     } friend();

    See also: "DlogS_$level".

  slogS_$level
    Mostly the same as "logS_$level", but expects a string as first
    argument, not a block. Arguments are passed through just the same, but
    since it's just a string, interpolation of arguments into it must be
    done manually.

     my $friend = slogS_trace 'I only have one friend.', friend();

  Dlog_$level
    Import Tag: ":dlog"

    Arguments: "CodeRef $returning_message, @args"

    All of the following six functions work the same as their "log_$level"
    brethren, except they return what is passed into them and put the
    stringified (with Data::Dumper::Concise) version of their args into $_.
    This means you can do cool things like the following:

     my @nicks = Dlog_debug { "names: $_" } map $_->value, $frew->names->all;

    and the output might look something like:

     names: "fREW"
     "fRIOUX"
     "fROOH"
     "fRUE"
     "fiSMBoC"

    Which functions are exported depends on what was passed to "-levels".
    The default (no "-levels" option passed) would export:

    Dlog_trace
    Dlog_debug
    Dlog_info
    Dlog_warn
    Dlog_error
    Dlog_fatal
      Note: "Dlog_fatal" does not call "die" for you, see "EXCEPTIONS AND
      ERROR HANDLING"

  Dslog_$level
    Mostly the same as "Dlog_$level", but expects a string as first
    argument, not a block. Arguments are passed through just the same, but
    since it's just a string, no interpolation point can be used, instead
    the Dumper output is appended.

     my @nicks = Dslog_debug "names: ", map $_->value, $frew->names->all;

  DlogS_$level
    Import Tag: ":dlog"

    Arguments: "CodeRef $returning_message, Item $arg"

    Like "logS_$level", these functions are a special case of "Dlog_$level".
    They only take a single scalar after the $returning_message instead of
    slurping up (and also setting "wantarray") all the @args

     my $pals_rs = DlogS_debug { "pals resultset: $_" }
       $schema->resultset('Pals')->search({ perlers => 1 });

  DslogS_$level
    Mostly the same as "DlogS_$level", but expects a string as first
    argument, not a block. Arguments are passed through just the same, but
    since it's just a string, no interpolation point can be used, instead
    the Dumper output is appended.

     my $pals_rs = DslogS_debug "pals resultset: ",
       $schema->resultset('Pals')->search({ perlers => 1 });

LOGGER CODEREF
    Anywhere a logger object can be passed, a coderef is accepted. This is
    so that the user can use different logger objects based on runtime
    information. The logger coderef is passed the package of the caller, and
    the caller level the coderef needs to use if it wants more caller
    information. The latter is in a hashref to allow for more options in the
    future.

    Here is a basic example of a logger that exploits "caller" to reproduce
    the output of "warn" with a logger:

     my @caller_info;
     my $var_log = Log::Contextual::SimpleLogger->new({
        levels  => [qw(trace debug info warn error fatal)],
        coderef => sub { chomp($_[0]); warn "$_[0] at $caller_info[1] line $caller_info[2].\n" }
     });
     my $warn_faker = sub {
        my ($package, $args) = @_;
        @caller_info = caller($args->{caller_level});
        $var_log
     };
     set_logger($warn_faker);
     log_debug { 'test' };

    The following is an example that uses the information passed to the
    logger coderef. It sets the global logger to $l3, the logger for the
    "A1" package to $l1, except the "lol" method in "A1" which uses the $l2
    logger and lastly the logger for the "A2" package to $l2.

    Note that it increases the caller level as it dispatches based on where
    the caller of the log function, not the log function itself.

     my $complex_dispatcher = do {

        my $l1 = ...;
        my $l2 = ...;
        my $l3 = ...;

        my %registry = (
           -logger => $l3,
           A1 => {
              -logger => $l1,
              lol     => $l2,
           },
           A2 => { -logger => $l2 },
        );

        sub {
           my ( $package, $info ) = @_;

           my $logger = $registry{'-logger'};
           if (my $r = $registry{$package}) {
              $logger = $r->{'-logger'} if $r->{'-logger'};
              my (undef, undef, undef, $sub) = caller($info->{caller_level} + 1);
              $sub =~ s/^\Q$package\E:://g;
              $logger = $r->{$sub} if $r->{$sub};
           }
           return $logger;
        }
     };

     set_logger $complex_dispatcher;

LOGGER INTERFACE
    Because this module is ultimately pretty looking glue (glittery?) with
    the awesome benefit of the Contextual part, users will often want to
    make their favorite logger work with it. The following are the methods
    that should be implemented in the logger:

     is_trace
     is_debug
     is_info
     is_warn
     is_error
     is_fatal
     trace
     debug
     info
     warn
     error
     fatal

    The first six merely need to return true if that level is enabled. The
    latter six take the results of whatever the user returned from their
    coderef and log them. For a basic example see
    Log::Contextual::SimpleLogger.

LOG ROUTING
    In between the loggers and the log functions is a log router that is
    responsible for finding a logger to handle the log event and passing the
    log information to the logger. This relationship is described in the
    documentation for "Log::Contextual::Role::Router".

    "Log::Contextual" and packages that extend it will by default share a
    router singleton that implements the with_logger() and set_logger()
    functions and also respects the -logger, -package_logger, and
    -default_logger import options with their associated default value
    functions. The router singleton is available as the return value of the
    router() function. Users of Log::Contextual may overload router() to
    return instances of custom log routers that could for example work with
    loggers that use a different interface.

EXCEPTIONS AND ERROR HANDLING
    "Log::Contextual", by design, does not intentionally invoke "die" on
    your behalf(*see footnote*) for "log_fatal".

    Logging events are characterized as information, not flow control, and
    conflating the two results in negative design anti-patterns.

    As such, "log_fatal" would at be better used to communicate information
    about a *future* failure, for example:

      if ( condition ) {
        log_fatal { "Bad Condition is true" };
        die My::Exception->new();
      }

    This has a number of benefits:

    *   You're more likely to want to use useful Exception Objects and flow
        control instead of cheating with log messages.

    *   You're less likely to run a risk of losing what the actual problem
        was when some error occurs in your creation of the Exception Object

    *   You're less likely to run the risk of losing important log context
        due to exceptions occurring mid way through "die" unwinding and
        "exit" global destruction.

    If you're still too lazy to use exceptions, then you can do what you
    probably want as follows:

      if ( ... ) {
        log_fatal { "Bad condition is true" };
        die "Bad condtion is true";
      }

    Or for ":dlog" style:

      use Data::Dumper::Consise qw( Dumper );
      if ( ... ) {
        # Dlog_fatal but not
        my $reason = "Bad condtion is true because: " . Dumper($thing);
        log_fatal { $reason };
        die $reason;
      }

  footnote
    The underlying behaviour of "log_fatal" is dependent on the backing
    library.

    All the Loggers shipping with "Log::Contextual" behave this way, as do
    many of the supported loggers, like "Log::Log4perl". However, not all
    loggers work this way, and one must be careful.

    "Log::Dispatch" doesn't support implementing "log_fatal" at all

    "Log::Dispatchouli" implements "log_fatal" using "die" ( via Carp )
