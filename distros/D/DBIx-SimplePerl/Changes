Revision history for Perl extension DBIx::SimplePerl.
1.95 Sun Mar 21 13:42:00 2010
	- fixed multi-field delete search conditional
1.90 Wed Dec  5 15:33:00 2007
	- added in operation to set which
	  operation is used to combine the search fields
	  in a db_search call.  By default the operation is 
	  'AND'.  This change gives the user the capability to 
	  use 'OR' 
	- added in the "DISTINCT=>column_name(s)" option for
	  db_search
1.80 Mon Jun 11 23:53:00 2007
	- fixed db_next to return what it should, and added in
	  db_array to return an array version of db_next.  Document
	  these elements in greater detail.
1.72 Sat Jun  9 12:49:00 2007
	- fixed min,max,count so that the will work with db_search 
	  and not interfere with each other.  Added some tests for
	  this.
1.70 Sun Apr 29 20:26:00 2007
	- fixed db_next, db_rows, db_rollback, db_ping.  Sadly, some of these
	  are broken in DBI/DBD::SQLite.  This means that it will be hard to test
	  db_ping and db_rows for now.
	- cleaned up code a little
	- added db_next test cases, and a few others.  db_next is a very sane
	  method for getting the next row hash.
1.60 Sat Mar 17 14:40:00 2007
	- added a saner OO iterator to return the next record in a query

1.50 Mon Aug 14 20:50:00 2006
	- Major changes/simplification to the error detection code
	- Simplification of error checking
	- Documentation fixes and extensions to include new features
	- Improved behavior and consistency in the face of errors
	- Trimmed uneeded code, module is smaller than it was before ...
	- Added internal function to handle replicated internal code
	- Tests added to check errors ...
1.42 Mon Aug 14 15:09:00 2006
	- added order and cols to db_search.  Order sorts by that column, and cols
          returns only those columns that you specify
1.41 Sun Jun 25 20:30:01 2006
	- added boolean condition search
1.40 Sun Jun 25 02:30:01 2006
	- added count, min, max methods to search
	- added count, min, max tests
1.31 Mon Jun 12 15:40:01 2006
	- added DBI in as an explicit requirement. Who knew
	  that someone would try to install a DBIx module without
	  DBI. 
1.30 Sun Jun 11 10:51:01 2006
	- added additional db_open option processing
	- fixed some style errors in the program text
	- added db_commit
1.24 Thu Dec 22 15:30:01 2005
	- bug fix for SQLite, incorrect field quoting...
1.23 Sun Dec 04 20:43:01 2005
	- bug fix for PostGreSQL quoting
	- bug fix for db_update, used a _quote_field call where
	  we needed a _quote_value call.
1.22 Sun Dec 04 15:36:01 2005
	- added quoting checks for postgresql and others
	  change by setting $object->{quoting} explicitly 
	  or letting the module decide for you.
1.21 Sun Nov 29 12:08:01 2005
        - minor bug fixes, YAML build,...
1.2  Sun Nov 28 12:08:01 2005
	- added create table function
1.1  Sun Nov 27 12:08:01 2005
	- RENAMED DBI::Simple to DBIx::SimplePerl.  This had
	  caused unintended confusion on the part of the users
	  whom needed DBI to remain for DBI bits only, and DBIx
	  for DBI-extensions.
	- added table creation
	- fixed some of the documentation and other bits as suggested 
	  by various users

1.0  Mon Oct 31 23:28:39 2005
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.23 with options
		-AX --skip-exporter --use-new-tests -n DBI::Simple -b 5.8.0 --email=landman@scalableinformatics.com -v1.0

	Imported SICE.pm into DBI::Simple, created tests, did
	basic documentation fixup.
