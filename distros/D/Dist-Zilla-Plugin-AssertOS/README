NAME

    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::AssertOS - Require that our distribution is
    running on a particular OS

VERSION

    version 0.08

SYNOPSIS

      # In dist.ini - It is important that AssertOS follows MakeMaker or
      # ModuleBuild
    
      [MakeMaker]
    
      [AssertOS]
      os = Linux
      os = FreeBSD
      os = cygwin

    The resultant distribution will die at Makefile.PL unless the platform
    the code is running on is Linux, FreeBSD or Cygwin.

DESCRIPTION

    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::AssertOS is a Dist::Zilla plugin that integrates
    Devel::AssertOS so that CPAN authors may easily stipulate which
    particular OS environments their distributions may be built and
    installed on.

    The author specifies which OS or OS families are supported. The
    necessary Devel::AssertOS files are copied to the inc/ directory and
    Makefile.PL or Build.PL is mungled to include the necessary
    incantation.

    On the module user side, the bundled inc/ Devel::AssertOS determines
    whether the current environment is supported or not and will die
    accordingly.

    As this plugin mungles the Makefile.PL/Build.PL it is imperative that
    it is specified in dist.ini AFTER [MakeMaker] or [ModuleBuild].

    This plugin also automagically adds the no_index metadata so that inc/
    is excluded from PAUSE indexing. If you use
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::MetaNoIndex, there may be conflicts.

 ATTRIBUTES

    os

      Specify as many times as wanted the OS that you wish your
      distribution to work with. See Devel::AssertOS and Devel::CheckOS for
      what may be given.

    bundle

      If set to c<0> Devel::AssertOS will not be bundled in the
      distribution. It will instead be added to configure_requires in the
      META files so CPAN clients can install it before running Makefile.PL.
      The default is 1, so Devel::AssertOS is bundled in inc.

    These are required by the roles that this plugin uses.

KUDOS

    Based on use-devel-assertos by David Cantrell

    Build.PL support contributed by Yanick Champoux

    Thanks to Ricardo Signes, not only for Dist::Zilla, but for explaining
    Dist::Zilla::Role::InstallTool's place in the build process. This made
    this plugin possible.
