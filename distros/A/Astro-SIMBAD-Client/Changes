    Repackage licenses so that GitHub can find them. Thanks to Mikko
    Koivunalho (specifically his blog post
    https://blogs.perl.org/users/mikko_koivunalho/2025/11/github-and-the-perl-license.html
    for the how-to.

    Add SECURITY policy.

    No known functional changes.

0.047		2023-01-07	T. R. Wyant
    Make XML::DoubleEncodedEntities optional.  Add test entities_test,
    without this module but with all others, to prove it is not needed
    -- or warn if it is, as the case may be.

0.046		2021-08-12	T. R. Wyant
    Correct generation of 'provides' metadata.  Thanks to Favio Poletti
    for blogging
    https://github.polettix.it/ETOOBUSY/2021/06/15/the-real-pause-workaround/,
    and ultimately to Joel Berger for the pointer to

    Default emulate_soap_queries to true and skip SOAP tests. This is
    because SOAP queries started failing with a 404 on March 22 2021.

0.044		2021-03-17	T. R. Wyant
    Add rt.cpan.org back to bug reporting methods. Long live RT!

    Refactor authortest into three, to avoid writing stub test files to
    exclude the optional modules.

    Fix POD link errors.

    Get prerequisites up to snuff and add xt/author/prereq.t to ensure
    they stay that way.

0.043		2021-01-09	T. R. Wyant
    Add Travis CI testing.

    Use GitHub as bug tracker. R.I.P. rt.cpan.org.

    Fix POD link redirects.

    Track change in Arcturus radial velocity (in test)

    Prohibit redirects in URL POD links.

0.040		2019-08-04	T. R. Wyant
    Fix POD link errors and add test to ensure that they stay fixed.

0.039		2019-04-16	T. R. Wyant
    Tweak canned test data.  SIMBAD changed the radial velocity of
    Arctusus; because the test checks the actual data returned, I have
    to follow it.

0.038		2018-10-02	T. R. Wyant
    Properly test without https: support. This means checking and
    skipping, but it also means including LWP::Protocol::https in the
    list of optional modules. Reluctantly, because it is not used
    directly.

0.037		2018-09-18	T. R. Wyant
    Add support for https:. Thanks to Christian Carey for making me
    aware of this, and providing patches.

    Update POD re SOAP deprecation and removal, plus general cleanup.
    Thanks to Christian Carey for the POD patches, which were accepted
    pretty much verbatim except for a few I thought were matters of
    style.

    Document use of LWP::UserAgent proxy environment variables. This
    really does not belong here, but I think the informaton gets lost in
    the libwww-perl documentation.

0.036		2016-09-26	T. R. Wyant
  SIMBAD now lists "Arcturus", not "ARCTURUS".
    Change tests to reflect this.

0.035		2016-09-14	T. R. Wyant
  Improve test for unavailable server

  Default server attribute to environment variable
    ASTRO_SIMBAD_CLIENT_SERVER if that has a true value.

  Tests of the release() method are now TODO. What happened was that on
    September 6 2016 the release information was omitted from the web
    site. It is back on the 7th, but once bitten twice shy.

  Have t/basic.t display SIMBAD server SW release

0.034		2016-01-05	T. R. Wyant
  Add GitHub repository to metadata.

0.033		2014-10-25	T. R. Wyant
  Remove installer question. The simbadc script is now installed by
    default. If you do not want it, run the installer with the -n
    option.

  Restructure data retrieval code to facilitate debugging.

0.032		2014-06-12	T. R. Wyant
  Add attribute emulate_soap_queries. If true, this attribute causes the
    query() method (and friends) to generate canned script queries
    rather than SOAP queries. If we are not using SOAP, query() and
    friends do not produce warnings.

  Eliminate use of each() built-in.

  Remove VO-format url_query test of MAIN_ID. A note from SIMBAD support
    January 6 2014 says they do not support any way to change what is in
    the MAIN_ID field in a url_query VO-format return. It _is_ supported
    in the script queries.

0.031		2014-02-05	T. R. Wyant
  Have installer scripts Build.PL and Makefile.PL notify of my intent to
    remove the 'install simbadc?' question and simply install it by
    default. The command-line options -y and -n will remain available.
    This is schedued for the first release after September 1 2014.

  Mark VO url query 'name' test TODO
    This started failing Feb 3 (returning '* alf Boo' rather than 'NAME
    Arcturus'). I found parameters that seem to influence the MAIN_iD
    returned by the text query, but not the VO query. So the test has been
    marked TODO, pending a response (if any) to the note I sent SIMBAD Feb 5
    2014. Script-based queries seem unaffected.

0.030		2014-01-01	T. R. Wyant
  Further deprecate the use of SOAP. The query() method (and methods
    that use it) now warns on every use. These will become fatal the
    first release after April 1 2014.

0.029		2013-11-18	T. R. Wyant
  Fix test failures due to SIMBAD metadata changes
    The VO-format url_query data has started returning keys 'RA_d' and
    'DEC_d' for decimal right ascension and declination, rather than
    'RA' and 'DEC'.

0.028		2013-11-08	T. R. Wyant
  Deprecate the use of SOAP. This includes the query() method and all
    methods that use it.

0.027		2013-07-28	T. R. Wyant
  Make use of the relevant FORMAT_* constants in t/simple.t and
    t/yaml.t.

  Make SOAP::Lite and XML::Parser optional. Especially the former.

  Strip the literal newlines from the FORMAT_TXT_* canned formats.

  Remove (well, rename) author test that fails when SOAP VO queries
    start working, and remove TODO for SOAP in t/vo.t, on receiving
    letter saying that the problem is fixed.

0.026		2012-10-30	T. R. Wyant
  Methods query*() with 'type' attribute 'vo' (in other words, SOAP
    VOTable queries) started failing October 24 2012. Since I think this
    is a server-side problem (famous last words!) I have made the
    relevant tests TODO and put a NOTICE in the Astro::SIMBAD::Client
    POD.

  Replace code that feels around for a working YAML module with code
    that just uses YAML itself.

0.025		2012-01-05	T. R. Wyant
  Bring Changes file into compliance with Test::CPAN::Changes, and add
    xt/author/changes.t to make sure it stays that way.

  Update copy of Gnu GPL in LICENSES/Copying to have current FSF
    address.

0.023		2011-11-01	T. R. Wyant
  Correct the t/yaml.t script so that the script_file( 't/arcturus.yaml' )
    tests are skipped if neither YAML nor YAML::Syck can be loaded.

  Add optional modules tests to the author tests, to be sure the above
    is fixed, and stays that way.

  Removed debug output from t/yaml.t

  Have the Astro::SIMBAD::Client script_file() method post the file to
    field 'scriptFile', not 'CriteriaFile', to match the current HTML
    form being emulated.

  Add debug output to t/yaml.t to try to track down why there are so
    many test failures in script_file( 't/arcturus.yaml' ).

  Update dependencies.

  Rewrite tests to use Test::More 0.88, and update build_requires for this.

  Comment tweaks to avoid a bug in Module::ExtractUse (i.e., play the
    CPANTS game).

  Correct t/vo.t radial velocity test.

0.022		2011-07-26	T. R. Wyant
  Update the canned recession velocity of Arcturus (used for testing) to
    match those retrieved from SIMBAD, which changed on or about July 25
    2011.

0.021		2011-06-27	T. R. Wyant
  Update the canned positions of Arcturus (used for testing) to match
    those retrieved from SIMBAD, which changed on or about June 27 2011.

0.020		2011-05-22	T. R. Wyant
  Update the canned positions of Arcturus to match those actually
    retrieved from SIMBAD, which changed on or about May 18 2011.

0.019		2011-03-03	T. R. Wyant
  Convert to Perl Foundation-recommended license.

  Reorganize author tests to run on separate Build.PL tag, not a magic
    environment variable.

  Module::Build is no longer required for configuration since you can
    use ExtUtils::MakeMaker if you wish.

0.018		2009-04-09	T. R. Wyant
  Distribute developer tests, but only run if DEVELOPER_TEST is set.

  Comply with Perl::Critic using profile t/perlcriticrc.

  Criticize code as part of developer testing.

  Drop unneeded 'use FileHandle' from Build.PL.

  Have Build.PL and Makefile.PL handle -y and -n to supress prompt and
    install or not install simbadc respectively.

  Correct 'help client' in bin/simbadc

  Update t/vo.t to track the fact that the SIMBAD4 URL query has gone
    back to decimal degrees for position.

0.017		2008-11-29	T. R. Wyant
  Fix test failure when YAML::Syck installed but YAML not.

0.016		2008-11-17	T. R. Wyant
  Eliminate calls to UNIVERSAL::isa as a function.

  Revise tests to deal more gracefully with 5xx errors.

0.015		2008-10-29	T. R. Wyant
  Split Astro::SIMBAD::Client::WSQueryInterfaceService into its own file
    for bookkeeping purposes.

0.014		2008-08-30	T. R. Wyant
  In Astro::SIMBAD::Client, Makefile.PL, Build.PL, require Perl 5.008,
    because MailTools does, and SOAP::Lite requires MailTools, and we
    require SOAP::Lite.

  Fix TAP emitted by t::TestSimbad, so that we get useful output when
    the server is unreachable or unresponsive.

  Add url_args attribute to provide default arguments to the url_query
    method.

  Add 'Astro::SIMBAD::Client' and version number to user agent string.

  Add Scalar::Util as a requirement, since this is not bundled with
    Perl 5.6.

  Add a delay (3 seconds by default) between queries of a given
    server. The 'delay' attribute controls this. Subsecond delays are
    available if Time::HiRes can be loaded.

  In bin/simbadc, parse <filename as replacing the token with the
    contents of the file.

0.011		2007-11-12	T. R. Wyant
  Modify parse module loader to use 'eval "require $module"' rather
    than generating .pm file name, to work with .pmc modules when and
    if they appear.

0.010		2007-10-18	T. R. Wyant
  Specify minimum Perl version of 5.006 in Build.PL and Makefile.PL.

  Change url_query VOTable tests from todo back to test, since they
    now work as of 18-Oct-2007.

  Corrected the code used to escape URLs in the centralized requester
    (use URL::Escape, not HTML::Entities).

0.009		2007-10-17	T. R. Wyant
  Add 'post' attribute.

  Mark url_query VOTable tests todo, since they stopped working
    15-Oct-2007. Document this under 'NOTICES' in the code.

  Clean up the POD tests.

  Remove shebang lines where not warranted.

0.008		2007-08-30	T. R. Wyant
  Add release() method, to return SIMBAD release number.

0.007		2007-03-26	T. R. Wyant
  Change FORMAT_VO_BASIC to return decimal degrees for right ascension
    and declination. This was always the intent, but could not be tested
    until 'vo' web service queries started working.

  Document change in status of web service 'vo' queries.

0.006		2007-03-20	T. R. Wyant
  Use XML::DoubleEncodedEntities to deal with occasional double
    encoding of VOTable data.

    ExtUtils::MakeMaker in use.

  Make Astro::SIMBAD::Client work with SOAP::Lite 0.55, which is what
    ships with ActivePerl.

0.002		2007-01-26	T. R. Wyant
  Modified Build.PL and Makefile.PL to ask if simbadc is to be installed.

  Modified vo tests to follow change of VOTable coordinate format
    to sexagesimal about SIMBAD4 1.005 January 26 2007.
