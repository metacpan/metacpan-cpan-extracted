NAME
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::UploadToCpanSite - Dist::Zilla Releaser plugin for
    uploading to CPAN::Site mirror.

VERSION
    version 1.132210

DESCRIPTION
      ; in dzil.ini
      [UploadToCpanSite]
      site        = /var/www/vhost/mycpansite/cpan
      host        = user@mycpansite.org
      author      = EXAMPLE

    CPAN::Site is a distribution for extending CPAN with private packages.
    This is a Dist::Zilla::Role::Releaser plugin that uploads a distribution
    tarball to such a site, and regenerates the site indices. It is intended
    to be used instead of Dist::Zilla::Plugin::UploadToCPAN.

ATTRIBUTES
  site
    The base location of the CPAN::Site, i.e. the value of CPANSITE_LOCAL in
    CPAN::Site's terms. This is mandatory.

  host
    The (user and) hostname at which the CPAN::Site is hosted. This is
    mandatory.

    Note that the user should have write permissions on the filesystem.

  author
    The CPAN author ID. Mandatory.

  directory
    The location of the 'authors' directory in the CPAN::Site site.
    Optional. If not supplied, is built from the 'site' and 'author'
    attributes, e.g. from the sample dist.ini fragment above, the value of
    directory would be
    '/var/www/vhosts/mycpansite/cpan/authors/id/E/EX/EXAMPLE'.

  cpan
    The location of the upstream CPAN archive (i.e. the value of
    CPANSITE_GLOBAL in CPAN::Site's terms). Optional, defaults to
    http://ftp.easynet.be/pub/CPAN/.

METHODS
  release ( $archive )
      This method does three things:

      1. Calls 'mkdir $self->directory' on the remote host.
      2. Transfers the archive to this location via scp.
      3. Executes 'cpansite index' on the remote host.

      Failure to perform any of these is a fatal error.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
    Initial development of this module took place during my employment at
    The Marketing Lab <http://themarketinglab.co.uk>. I am grateful to the
    management for allowing me to release this to the CPAN.
