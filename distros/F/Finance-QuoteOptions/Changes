  Most of the changes are from Dan Dascalescu. However, the author
  found a few difficulties and had to make some changes.

  + added an option to ->retrieve to only fetch the next N expiration
    dates. If you only care about the current expiration, this makes
    retrieval a few times faster
  + added in_the_money hash key determined from the style of the cells
    (yellow = in the money)
  + fixed bug #43145 regarding options with no PUTs
  + fixed hang on stock symbols with no data at all (e.g. 'foobar')
  + no longer die if the HTTP request to the server happens to fail
  + ->symbol('NEW') can now set a new symbol for subsequent ->retrieves
  + cleaned up ${${${foo...}}} constructs, using the arrow operator
  + updated documentation
  + refactored code to pass Perl::Critic 'gentle'

  Dan attempted to switch from WWW::Mechanize to the lighter LWP::UserAgent 
  for Yahoo! mode. However, this change caused various applications the
  author uses to crash in addition to not working with the CBOE code.
  Switching back to WWW::Mechanize fixed these problems.

0.12 Jul 8 2007
  - Query code now returns immediately if first HTTP retrieval
    fails. Fixes occasional query hang.
  - Documentation fixes.

0.11 Jun 1 2007
  - Looks like the CBOE *does* blacklist IPs that pull too
    much data. Warning added to documentation.

  - Added code to the CBOE section that will calculate the
    expiration date from the month and year if the detail page
    is unavailable. This was because I was blacklisted in two
    steps, first the detail page on a Friday, then the main page
    on a Monday. I was hoping that the blacklist would happen
    only on the detail page. Alas.
