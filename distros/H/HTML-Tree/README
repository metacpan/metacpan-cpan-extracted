HTML-Tree version 5.07, released 2017-08-31


This distribution contains a suite of modules for representing,
creating, and extracting information from HTML syntax trees; there is
also relevent documentation.  These modules used to be part of the
libwww-perl distribution, but are now unbundled in order to facilitate
a separate development track.  Bug reports and discussions about these
modules can be sent to the RT queue at <bug-html-tree@rt.cpan.org>.

The modules and documentation present in this collection are:

  HTML::Tree -- overview of the modules.

  HTML::Tree::AboutObjects -- an article by Sean M. Burke from
    The Perl Journal #17: "User's View of Object-Oriented Modules"

  HTML::Tree::AboutTrees -- an article by Sean M. Burke from
    The Perl Journal #18: "Trees", about tree-shaped data
    structures in Perl.

  HTML::Tree::Scanning -- an article by Sean M. Burke from
    The Perl Journal #19: "Scanning HTML".


  HTML::Element - class for representing the nodes of the HTML syntax
        trees.  The elements have other elements and text segments
        as children.  The HTML::Element class has methods to build,
        alter, and traverse the structure of the tree.

  HTML::TreeBuilder - a class that uses HTML::Parser to read HTML
        document text and build from it a syntax tree made of
        HTML::Element nodes.

  HTML::Parse - deprecated module.  Now just a wrapper around
        HTML::TreeBuilder

  HTML::AsSubs - module providing an easy way to build an HTML syntax
        tree by nesting functions.
