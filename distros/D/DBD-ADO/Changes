2005-12-04  2.95

  Changed bind_param() to use an optional ado_size attribute.
  This is a workaround for the SQLOLEDB bug documented earlier.

  Replaced global error variables with handle attributes.

2005-01-30  2.94

  Reworked db/st handle attributes:
  - fetching all the data of a SELECT sets Active off
  - dropped the RowsInCache attribute (ADO doesn't provide this
    information and it was confused with RowCacheSize anyway)
  - added support for the RowCacheSize attribute
  - dropped the User attribute
  - deprecated CursorType, Filter, ADO_Columns, Trim_Catalog
    (use the corresponding ado_* attributes)
  - added ado_ConnectionTimeout and ado_Mode to avoid the abuse of the
    ConnectionString

  Renamed ADOTEST to DBD_TEST.

2004-10-17  2.93

  Minor changes to the STORE() methods.

  Moved more datatype related stuff into DBD::ADO::TypeInfo.

  Implemented some timeout tests (t/29timeout.t).

  Changed a test in t/14rows.t due to an API change in
  Test::More 0.34 (is()'s undef/'' handling).

  Removed the $sth->{BadAttributeHere} test from t/21sth.t,
  because getting/setting an invalid attribute no longer is
  a fatal error in DBI 1.43.

2004-05-02  2.91

  Adjusted the trace levels in trace_msg().

  Removed disconnect_all().

2004-03-21  2.90

2004-01-18  2.85

  Improved error handling to avoid problems with success/informational
  messages, reported by Ed Belisle and Peter Hircock.
  These 'success with information' conditions no longer trigger the normal
  DBI error handling mechanisms.

2004-01-11  2.84

  Reimplemented NULL tests (t/23null.t).

  Fixed a DBD::Proxy related bug, reported by Peter Hircock.
  The execute() method returned a Win32::OLE::Variant object which
  couldn't be restored at the client w/o Win32::OLE.

2003-12-14  2.83

  Added notes about Unicode support thanks to Stefan Ram and Jan Dubois.

2003-11-16  2.79

  Added t/51qi.t to test quoted identifiers (and removed similar
  tests from t/15func.t).

  Added t/07q.t to test quoted values (and removed similar tests
  from t/15func.t).

  Completed the Win32::OLE::Const to DBD::ADO::Const transition.

  Modified t/09bind.t to use Test::More.
