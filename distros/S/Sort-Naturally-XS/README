Sort-Naturally-XS version 0.7.8
===============================

DESCRIPTION

Sort::Naturally::XS - Perl extension for human-friendly ("natural") sort order.

Natural sort order is an ordering of mixed strings (consist of characters and digits) in alphabetical order, except that
digital parts are ordered as numbers. Natural sorting can be considered as a replacement of a standard machine-oriented
alphabetical sorting, because it is more convenient for human understanding.
