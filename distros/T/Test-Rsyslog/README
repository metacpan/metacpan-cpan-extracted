SYNOPSIS

      my $rsyslog = Test::Rsyslog->new();
    
      Sys::Syslog::setlogsock({ type => 'unix', path => $rsyslog->socket_path() });
      # or "Sys::Syslog::setlogsock('unix', $rsyslog->socket_path());" for older Sys::Syslogs
      Sys::Syslog::openlog('program[' . $$ . ']','cons','LOG_LOCAL7');
      Sys::Syslog::syslog('info|LOG_LOCAL7','This is a test message');

DESCRIPTION

    This module allows easy creation and tear down of a rsyslog instance.
    When the variable goes out of scope, the rsyslog instance is torn down
    and the file system objects it relies on are removed.

SUBROUTINES/METHODS

 new

    This method will setup and start the rsyslog instance. It currently has
    no parameters, but this may change in response to feature requests

 socket_path

    This method returns that path to the UNIX file system socket that is
    connected to the current running instance of rsyslog

 find($string)

    This method searches the existing logs that rsyslog has processed to
    see if a message has been found matching $string. It will return a list
    of every line in the log file that matches $string.

 start

    This method starts the rsyslog instance

 stop

    This method stops the rsyslog instance

 alive

    This method checks to make sure that the rsyslogd instance is still
    running

 messages

    This method returns the content of the rsyslogd log file

 scrub

    This method truncates the rsyslogd log file. Rsyslogd must be stopped
    to truncate the log file

DIAGNOSTICS

    Temporary rsyslog daemon is already running...

    Unable to truncate while rsyslogd is still running

      This module will not truncate the messages file while rsyslogd could
      still be writing to it

    Unable to untaint the directory path

      The module generated an unrecognisable temporary path for rsyslogd
