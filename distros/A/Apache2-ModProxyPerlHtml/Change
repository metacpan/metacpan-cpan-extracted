28 Jul 2013 - Version 3.6

	- Make replace pattern an evalable expression so that you can use $1 in
	  replacement pattern with ProxyHTMLRewrite. Thanks to Roberto Majadas
	  for the report.
	- Update documentation about AddHandler vs SetHandler to avoid error
	  "Attempt to serve directory", with SetHandler DirectoryIndex is not
	  working any more. Thanks to Brad Robertson for the report.
	- Add PerlAddVar before examples in documentation.
	- Add new directive ProxyHtmlExcludeUri to allow URIs to be excluded
	  from any rewritting. This is to be used to fix some weird replacements
	  in javascript library. Thanks to Brad Robertson for the report.

11 Dec 2012 - Version 3.5

	- Fix documentation about ProxyHTMLContentType, PerlAddVar was missing.
	  Thanks to cepelessar for the report.
	- Allow rewrite of Referer value into the HTTP header. Thanks to snadal
	  for the feature request.

15 Aug 2012 - Version 3.4

	- Add support of space characters in ProxyHTMLURLMap an ProxyHTMLRewrite
	  pattern definition. The issue reported by Steffen Rheinhold occurs
	  when you want to rewrite some HTML code with space character in it.
	  As space is the separator character used between the search pattern
	  and the string to substitute. For exemple writing such a replacement:

		PerlAddVar ProxyHTMLRewrite "ajaxurl[\t\s]+=[\t\s]+'/blog' ajaxurl = '/www2.domain.org/blog'" 

	  is now fully supported, before it should break after the first space
	  of the replacement string and using '\s' in this replacement string
	  will not solve the problem as it still write 's' instead of a space. 

25 Jun 2012 - Version 3.3

	- Fix corruption of openxml MS Office document (docx, dotx, potx, ppsx,
	  pptx, xlsx and xltx). Thanks to Stefano Colanzi for the report.
	- Add new directive ProxyHTMLExcludeContentType with default value to
	  regex: (application\/vnd\.openxml) to fix the previous issue and let
	  users customize the content-type exclusion regex.

		https://github.com/darold/modproxyperlhtml

	  refresh header and http content. Code with inflate/deflate calls will
	  also be logged.
	- Replace call to the warn log method by method Apache2::ServerRec::warn
	  to add timestamp to verbose trace.

Note that you can always use: RequestHeader unset Accept-Encoding
