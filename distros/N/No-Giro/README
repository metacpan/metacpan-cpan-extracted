No-Giro version 0.2
===================

This is a Perl Module for generating Norwegian bank slips. 

It provides some methods to enter data into a standard F60-1 GIRO
slip. This is an A4 sheet with a standard layout and where data are
entered at the bottom and there is some space to enter any information
at the top. It returns an Encapsulated Postscript object that can be
used in a Postscript document, which again is suitable to be printed. 

This is an early release, mostly thrown together to meet the needs of
the author. It should nevertheless be useful for most of those issuing
these kinds of slips. It has methods to set all sensible fields, but
two are still left out, they are both something that very few issuers
would ever need to set.
