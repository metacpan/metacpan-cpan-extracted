Sys::Hwloc
==========

This is a perl binding for the Portable Hardware Locality (hwloc) library.
See http://www.open-mpi.org/projects/hwloc/ for details.


DEPENDENCIES
------------

This module requires hwloc >= 0.9 (recommended: >= 1.1)

Makefile.PL uses ExtUtils::MakeMaker and ExtUtils::Constant
to create the Makefile.

Parts of the test suite need Test::More >= 0.89.

The module was tested on some i686/intel64 machines
running recent Linux and Perl 5.8.8 or 5.10.

Other architectures were not tested.

The Windows OS is currently not supported.


INSTALLATION
------------

To install this module, type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

hwloc libraries and header files are searched for by using pkg-config.
If they cannot be found, set the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable
to the directory where the file hwloc.pc is located.


EXAMPLE SCRIPTS
---------------

Look into the examples directory to get inspired.


HWLOC API VERSION
-----------------

The configure step figures out the value of the HWLOC_API_VERSION constant
from hwloc.h, and compiles and exports Hwloc functions accordingly.
Thus, the Hwloc module depends on the hwloc version against which it was built.
Undefined results are got when another hwloc library version is used at
runtime.

This constant was introduced in hwloc 1.0. For earlier hwloc versions,
the Hwloc module exports this constant with an undefined value. For convenience,
the Hwloc module also exports the constant HWLOC_XSAPI_VERSION, which
is always defined.

These constants can be used in a Perl script using Hwloc as follows to make it
work with different HWLOC_API_VERSIONs:

$proc_t = HWLOC_API_VERSION() ? HWLOC_OBJ_PU() : HWLOC_OBJ_PROC();

To bind a Perl script to a specific hwloc API version, check it
in a BEGIN block:

BEGIN {
  die "This script needs HWLOC_XSAPI_VERSION >= 0x00010000\n" unless
    HWLOC_XSAPI_VERSION() >= 0x00010000;
}

The compatibility matrix of released hwloc versions with Sys::Hwloc is

   0.9.1   not tested
   0.9.2   works (some tests fail due to unspecified C API behaviour)
   0.9.3   works (some tests fail due to unspecified C API behaviour)
   1.0     not tested
   1.0.1   not tested
   1.0.2   works
   1.0.3   works
   1.1     works (tests 08-bitmap 2,59 fail due to hwloc bug)



XML SUPPORT
-----------

The configure step tries to figure out if the hwloc library was
built with XML support.

Depending on the result, Hwloc functions dealing with XML
are compiled and exported or not, and the special constant
Sys::Hwloc::HWLOC_HAS_XML is exported with a true or false value.
It can be used in Perl scripts using Hwloc as follows:

if(HWLOC_HAS_XML) {
  $topology->export_xml('-');
} else {
  die "Your hwloc lib was built without XML support";
}


CPUSETS, NODESETS, BITMAPS
--------------------------

In hwloc 0.9 and 1.0 a hwloc_obj struct defines
the struct members cpuset and nodeset with C type hwloc_cpuset.
Data of type hwloc_cpuset become created and manipulated with
functions of the Cpuset API.
When built with these hwloc versions, the Sys::Hwloc module exports
the functions of the Cpuset API with EXPORT_TAG :cpuset,
blesses these data into the namespace Sys::Hwloc::Cpuset,
and provides OO-ish methods for them.

In hwloc 1.1 a hwloc_obj struct defines struct members with
C type hwloc_cpuset, and struct members with C type hwloc_nodeset.
Both C types are aliases of the C type hwloc_bitmap. These
data become created and manipulated with functions of the Bitmap API.
When built with these hwloc versions, the Sys::Hwloc module
exports the functions of the Bitmap API with EXPORT_TAG :bitmap,
blesses these data into the namespace Sys::Hwloc::Bitmap,
and provides OO-ish methods for them.
A distrinction between the C types hwloc_cpuset and hwloc_nodeset
is not made.


TESTING
-------

The test suite runs tests against the hwloc topology of the current
machine.

Arbitrary topologies can be tested when Hwloc was compiled
with XML support. Set the HWLOC_XMLFILE environment variable
to the path of an XML file describing the topology,
and run the test suite.

The test suite makes assumptions about what C API functions should
return, based on the docs and observed behaviour of hwloc-1.0.

Some tests may apparently fail when testing return values,
if other versions are used and the hwloc C API behaves differently.


TODO
----

- extend XML support by using XML::LibXML


BUGS
----

Note that this is a wrapper, which cannot correct bugs in the underlying
hwloc library.
