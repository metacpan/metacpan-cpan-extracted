=head1 NAME

Sah::Type - Standard types

=head1 VERSION

This document describes version 0.9.46 of Sah::Type (from Perl distribution Sah), released on 2019-07-19.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document specifies Sah standard types.

=head1 TYPE: undef

This type does not have any clauses. The only value it knows is the undefined
value (like C<undef> in Perl, or C<null> in PHP).

=head1 ROLE: BaseType

This is the base type role, all Sah types (except C<undef>) must implement this
role.

=head2 Clauses

The list below is ordered by priority, from highest to lowest.

=head3 defhash_v

Value: L<float|/"TYPE: float">.

Priority: 0 (checked first before everything else).

Category: metadata.

From L<DefHash>. Normally there is no need to set this.

=head3 v

Value: float, default: 1.

Priority: 0 (checked first before everything else).

Category: metadata.

From DefHash. Specify Sah version. Should be C<1> at the moment.

=head3 schema_v

Value: float, default 1.

Priority: 0 (checked first before everything else).

Category: metadata.

Specify schema version. By default assumed to be 1 if not set.

=head3 base_v

Value: float, default 1.

Priority: 0 (checked first before everything else).

Category: metadata.

Specify base schema version. By default assumed to be 1 if not set. Using a base
schema with a different value will fail. Can be used to force child schemas to
update whenever we change our schema. For example:

 // schema: vocal
 ["str", {"in": ["a", "e", "i", "o", "u"]}]

 // schema: consonant, defined in terms of "vocal", by
 ["vocal", {"match": "\\A[a-z]\\z", "in.op": "not"}]

However, if C<vocal> changes its implementation or structure to:

 // the new vocal
 ["str", {"match": "\\A[aeiou]\\z"}]

then B<consonant> will silently break because of clash (overriding) in the
C<match> clause. To force B<consonant> to fail (so its author can update it,
should the authors of C<vocal> and C<consonant> are two different persons):

 // the new vocal
 ["str", {"schema_v": 2, "match": "\\A[aeiou]\\z"}]

Since C<vocal>'s C<schema_v> is now 2, it is not the same as 1 (which is implied
by C<consonant>, having the default value of that of L</base_v>). C<consonant>'s
author might then update its own implementation to match C<vocal>:

 // the adjusted consonant
 ["vocal", {"base_v":2, "clset":{"match":"\\A[a-z]\\z"}, "match.op":"not"}]

Notice the matching of C<consonant>'s L</base_v> against C<vocal>'s
L</schema_v>. C<consonant> might also add its own C<< "schema_v":2 >> so other
schemas depending on it are forced to adjust, if needed.

=head3 c

Value: any.

Priority: 0 (checked first before anything else).

Category: metadata

Used to store compiler-specific options in its attributes. Example:

 "c.perl.use_defined_or": 0

=head3 ok

Value: true.

Return value: true (always succeeds).

Priority: 1 (very high). This is processed before all other clauses.

Category: constraint.

Will do nothing. This clause is just a convenience if you want to do nothing (or
perhaps just use the attributes of this clause to do things). It is the default
in the C<else> section of the L</if> clause.

To force failure, you can use C<< "!ok": true >>.

=head3 default

Value: any.

Priority: 1 (very high). This is processed before all other clauses except
L</ok>.

Category: default.

Attributes specific to this clause: C<temp> (bool, default 0, if set to
true then default value will only be used during validation and at the end data
will not use this value).

Supply a default value.

Example: Given schema C<< ["int", {"req": 1}] >> an undef data is invalid, but
given schema C<< ["int", {"req": 1, "default": 3}] >> an undef data is valid
because it will be given default value first.

=head3 default_lang

Value: str (locale code)d default C<en_US>.

Priority: 2 (very high), after L</default>.

Category: metadata.

From DefHash. Set default language for this schema. Language-dependant attribute
values (e.g. L</summary>, L</description>) will be assumed to be in the default
language.

=head3 name

Value: str or C<[str, str]>.

Priority: 2 (very high), after L</default>.

Category: metadata.

From DefHash. A short noun (usually one or two words, without any formatting) to
name the schema, useful for compiler that transform the schema to human
description text.

Aside from string, it can also be a two-element string to set the singular and
plural form of the noun.

To store translations, you can use DefHash's C<alt.lang.*> clause attributes (or
its shortcut form using C<(LANG)> suffix).

Example:

 ["int", {
     "min": 0,
     "name": ["positive integer", "positive integers"],
     "name(id_ID)": "bilangan positif"
 }]

See also: L</summary>, L</description>, L</tags>.

=head3 caption

Value: str.

Priority: 2 (very high), after L</default>.

From DefHash.

=head3 summary

Value: str.

Priority: 2 (very high), after L</default>.

Category: metadata.

From DefHash. A one-line text (about 72 characters maximum, without any
formatting) to describe the schema. This is useful, e.g. for manually describing
a schema instead of using the human compiler. It can also be used in form field
labels.

To store translations, you can use DefHash's C<alt.lang.*> clause attributes (or
its shortcut form using C<(LANG)> suffix).

Example:

 // definition for 'single_dice_throw' schema/type
 ["int", {
     "req": 1,
     "summary":
         "A number representing result of single dice throw (1-6)",
     "summary(id_ID)":
         "Bilangan yang menyatakan hasil lempar sebuah dadu (1-6)",
     "between": [1, 6]
 }]

Without the summary, using a compiler to human text the above schema might be
output as the standard, more boring "Integer, value between 1 and 6".

See also: L</name>, L</description>, L</tags>.

=head3 description

Value: str.

Priority: 2 (very high), after L</default>.

Category: metadata.

From DefHash. A longer text (a paragraph or more) to describe the schema, useful
e.g. for help/usage text. Text should be in Markdown format.

To store translations, you can use DefHash's C<alt.lang.*> clause attributes (or
its shortcut form using C<(LANG)> suffix).

Example (using Perl syntax because it supports heredoc):

 ["array", {
     name        => 'http_headers',
     description => <<EOT,
 HTTP headers should be specified as an array of 2-element arrays (pairs). Each
 pair should contain header name in the first element (all lowercase, *-*
 written as *_*) and header value in the second element.

 Example:

     [["content_type","text/html"], ["accept","text/html"], ["accept","*/*"]]

 EOT
     req         => 1,
     of          => 'http_header',
  },
  {
      def => {
          http_header => ['array*', len=>2],
      },
 }]

See also: L</name>, L</summary>, L</tags>.

=head3 tags

Value: array of str.

Priority: 2 (very high), after L</default>.

Category: metadata.

From DefHash. A list of tags, can be used to categorize schemas.

See also: L</name>, L</summary>, L</description>.

=head3 req

Value: bool.

Priority: 3 (very high), executed after L</default>.

Category: constraint.

If set to 1, require that data be defined. Otherwise, allow data to be undef
(the default behaviour).

By default, undef will pass even elaborate schema, e.g. C<< ["int", {"min": 0,
"max": 10, "div_by": 3}] >> will still pass an undef. However, undef will not
pass C<< ["int": {"req": 1}] >>.

This behaviour is much like NULLs in SQL: we *can't* (in)validate something that
is unknown/unset.

See also: L</forbidden>

=head3 forbidden

Value: bool.

Priority: 3 (very high), executed after L</default>.

Category: constraint.

This is the opposite of L</req>, requiring that data be not defined (i.e.
undef).

Given schema C<< ["int", {"forbidden": 1}] >>, a non-undef value will fail.
Another example: the schema C<< ["int", {"req": 1, "forbidden": 1}] >> will
always fail due to conflicting clauses.

See also: L</req>

=head3 prefilters

Value: array of expression string.

Priority: 10 (high). Run after L</default> and L</req>/L</forbidden>.

Category: filter.

Attributes specific to this clause: C<temp> (bool, default 0, if set to true
then prefiltered value will only be used during validation and at the end of the
clause set data will not use this value).

Run expression(s), usually to preprocess data before further checking. Data is
referred to in expression by variable C<$_>. Prefiltered value should persist
until the end of all other clauses (until the end of clause set), after which
the old value can be restored.

=head3 clause

Value: 2-element array C<[CLNAME, CLVAL]>.

Return value: clause return value.

Priority: 50 (normal)

Category: constraint.

Evaluate a clause. Example:

 ["int", "clause", ["div_by", 2]] // equivalent to ["int", "div_by", 2]

This clause is useful when combined with the C<.op> attribute. Example:

 ["int", "clause|", [["div_by", 2], ["xmin", 10]]]
 // equivalent to:
 // ["int", "clause", [["div_by", 2], ["xmin", 10]], "clause.op", "or"]

The above schema says that the integer needs to be divisible by 2 or larger than
10.

=head3 clset

Value: hash.

Return value: int (number of successful clauses + 1) on success, false on
failure.

Priority: 50 (normal)

Category: constraint.

Evaluate a clause set. Note that return value adds 1 to the number of successful
clauses to avoid returning 0 (evaluates to false). And it will only be returned
if clause is successful. Otherwise false (0) will be returned. Example:

 // require that data is between 1 and 10.
 // equivalent to ["int", "min", 1, "max", 10]
 ["int", "clset", {"min": 1, "max": 10}]

 // require that either data is between 1 and 10, or 90 and 100
 ["int", "clset|", [{"min": 1, "max": 10}, {"min": 90, "max": 100}]]

See also: L</clause>.

=head3 check

Value: expression string.

Return value: result of evaluated expression

Priority: 50 (normal)

Category: constraint.

Evaluate expression, which must evaluate to a true value for this clause to
succeed. Examples:

 // require that string is a palindrome, using a Sah function
 ["str", "check", "is_palindrome($_)"]

 // require that the *length of* string is a prime number
 ["str", "check", "is_prime(len($_))"]

=head3 prop

Value: 2-element str C<[PROP, SCHEMA]>.

Return value: bool

Priority: 50 (normal)

Category: constraint

Validate property against a schema. Example:

 // require that the *length of* string is divisible by 2
 ["str", "prop", ["len", ["int", "div_by", 2]]]

See also: L</check_prop>

=head3 check_prop

Value: 2-element str C<[PROP, SCHEMA]>.

Return value: result of evaluated expression

Priority: 50 (normal)

Category: constraint

Just like L</check>, but instead of checking data itself, check property
C<PROP>. Example:

 // require that the *length of* string is a prime number
 ["str", "check_prop", ["len", "is_prime($_)"]]

 // check that the email's Subject header is a palindrome
 ["email", "check_prop", [["headers", "subject"], "is_palindrome($_)"]]

See also: L</prop>

=head3 if

Value:

 [COND, THEN] -> any
 [COND, THEN, ELSE] -> any

Return value: if condition is true, then the C<THEN> result, otherwise the
C<ELSE> result.

Priority: 50 (normal)

Category: constraint.

A generic condition clause. C<COND>, C<THEN>, and C<ELSE> are either boolean
values, expressions (if they are string) or a clause set (if they are hash) or a
schema (if they are array). C<COND> is evaluated, if the result is true then
C<THEN> is evaluated, otherwise C<ELSE> is evaluated. C<ELSE> is optional.

Examples:

 // forbid the string to be lowercase
 "if": [{"match": "^[a-z]$"}, false]

 // if string is lowercase, it must be a palindrome
 "if": [{"match": "^[a-z]$"}, "is_palindrome($_)"]

 // if string is lowercase, it must be a palindrome, otherwise it must be longer
 // than 3 characters.
 "if": [{"match": "^[a-z]$"}, "is_palindrome($_)", "len($_) > 3"]

 // require the length of the string to be an even number
 "if": [{"prop": ["len", ["int", "div_by", 2]]}, true}

 // if string is a palindrome, then require it to have length > 5
 "if": [{"check": "is_palindrome($_)"}, ["len", ["int", "xmin": 5]]]

Note that you have to write schema in array form instead of string form, to
avoid ambiguity with expression:

 // parsed as expression, wrong!
 "if": ["int", true]

 // correct
 "if": [["int"], true]

=head3 postfilters

Value: array of expression strings.

Priority: 90 (very low). Run after all other clauses.

Category: filter.

Run expression(s), usually to postprocess data. Data is referred to in
expression by variable C<$_>. From here on, the data will be permanently set to
the postfiltered value.

=head3 examples

Value: array of (non-hash values|defhash)

Priority: 99 (informational)

Category: metadata.

A list of sample valid values. Can be used, e.g. for documentation, testing, or
completion. Each element is sample value, except when value is a hash then it is
assumed as a defhash (with the actual value in the C<value> property). So if
your sample value happens to be a hash like C<{}>, it has to be specified as C<<
{"value":{}} >>.

Note that this clause is informational only and does not require the value to be
in one of the specified examples (use L</in> clause for this purpose).

See also: L</invalid_examples>, L</in>.

=head3 invalid_examples

Value: array of (non-hash values|defhash)

Priority: 99 (informational)

Category: metadata.

This is the counterpart of L</examples>, containing examples of invalid values.

See also: L</examples>.

=head1 ROLE: Comparable

This is the comparable type role. All types which have comparable values must
implement this role. Most types implement this role, including L<str|/"TYPE:
str">, all number types, etc.

=head2 Clauses

=head3 in

Value: array of any values.

Priority: 50 (normal)

Category: constraint

Require that the data be one of the specified choices.

Examples:

 ["int", {"in": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]}] // single dice throw value
 ["str", {"!in": ["root", "admin", "administrator"]}] // forbidden usernames

To provide sample valid values that are not binding, use the L</examples>
clause.

See also: L</examples>, L</match> (for type L<str|/"TYPE: str">), L</has> (for
L<HasElems|/"ROLE: HasElems"> types).

=head3 is

Value: any.

Priority: 50 (normal)

Category: constraint

Require that the data is the same as VALUE. Will perform a numeric comparison
for numeric types, or stringwise for string types, or deep comparison for deep
structures.

Examples:

 ["int", {"is": 3}]
 ["int", {"is&": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]}] // effectively the same as 'in'

=head1 ROLE: HasElems

This is the role for types that have the notion of elements/length. It provides
clauses like L</max_len>, L</len>, L</len_between>, L</each_elem>, etc. It is
used by L<array|/"TYPE: array">, L<hash|/"TYPE: hash">, and also L<str|/"TYPE:
str">.

=head2 Properties

=head3 len (HasElems property)

Number.

=head3 elems (HasElems property)

Array.

=head3 indices (HasElems property)

Array.

=head2 Clauses

=head3 max_len

Value: uint.

Priority: 50 (normal)

Category: constraint

Requires that the data have at most the specified number of elements.

Example:

 ["str", {"req": 1, "max_len": 10}] // string with at most 10 characters

=head3 min_len

Value: uint.

Priority: 50 (normal)

Category: constraint

Requires that the data have at least the specified number of elements.

Example:

 ["array", {"min_len": 1}] // define an array with at least one element

=head3 len_between

Value: 2-element array (C<[NUM_MIN, NUM_MAX]>)

Priority: 50 (normal)

Category: constraint

A convenience clause that combines L</min_len> and L</max_len>.

Example, the two schemas below are equivalent:

 ["str", {"len_between": [1, 10]}]
 ["str", {"min_len": 1, "max_len": 10}]

=head3 len

Value: uint.

Priority: 50 (normal)

Category: constraint

Requires that the data have exactly NUM elements.

=head3 has

Value: any.

Priority: 50 (normal)

Category: constraint

Requires that the data contains the element. This is the counterpart of the
L</in> clause.

Examples:

 // requires that array has element x
 ["array", {"has": "x"}]

 // requires that array has elements 'x', 'y', and 'z'
 ["array", {"has&": ["x", "y", "z"]}]

 // requires that string does not have character 'x'
 ["str", {"!has": "x"}]

=head3 uniq

Value: bool.

If set to 1, require that the element values be unique (like in a set). If set
to 0, require that there are duplicates in the elements. For example, given this
schema:

 ["array", "uniq", true]

this data passes: C<< [1, 2, 3] >> but this one does not: C<< [1, 2, 1] >>.

=head3 each_elem

Value: schema.

Priority: 50 (normal)

Category: constraint, looping

Requires that every element of data validate to the specified schema. The first
element that fails the schema will terminate the loop.

Examples:

 ["array", {"each_elem": "int"}]
 ["array", {"of": "int"}] // same thing, "of" is the same as "each_elem"

The above specifies an array of integers.

 ["hash", {"each_elem": ["str", {"match": "^[A-Za-z0-9]+$" }]}]

The above specifies hash with alphanumeric-only values.

=head3 check_each_elem

Value: expression string.

Priority: 50 (normal)

Category: constraint, looping

Just like L</each_elem> but instead of using schema, each element is tested
using expression.

=head3 each_index

Value: schema.

Priority: 50 (normal)

Category: constraint, looping

Like L</each_elem> but iterates over the indices. For type like L<array|/"TYPE:
array">, this is 0, 1, ... N. For L<hash|/"TYPE: hash">, this is the keys of
hash.

=head3 check_each_index

Value: expression string.

Priority: 50 (normal)

Category: constraint, looping

Like L</each_index> but instead of using schema, each index is tested using
expression.

=head3 exists

Value: schema.

Priority: 50 (normal)

Category: constraint, looping

Test that there is at least one element of data that validates to the schema.
That element is returned. Be careful to not return element which has the value
which evaluates to false.

=head3 check_exists

Value: expression string.

Priority: 50 (normal)

Category: constraint, looping

Just like L</exists> but instead of using schema, each element is tested using
expression.

=head1 ROLE: Sortable

This is the type role for sortable types. It provides clauses like L</min>,
L</max>, and L</between>. It is used by many types, for example L<str|/"TYPE:
str">, all numeric types, etc.

=head2 Clauses

=head3 min

Value: any.

Require that the value is not less than some specified minimum (equivalent in
intention to the Perl string C<ge> operator, or the numeric C<< >= >> operator).

Example:

 ["int", "min", 0] // specify positive numbers

=head3 xmin

Value: any.

Require that the value is not less nor equal than some specified minimum
(equivalent in intention to the Perl string C<gt> operator, or the numeric C<< >
>> operator). The C<x> prefix is for "exclusive".

=head3 max

Value: any.

Require that the value is less or equal than some specified maximum (equivalent
in intention to the Perl string C<le> operator, or the numeric C<< <= >>
operator).

=head3 xmax

Value: any.

Require that the value is less than some specified maximum (equivalent in
intention to the Perl string C<lt> operator, or the numeric C<< < >> operator).
The C<x> prefix is for "exclusive".

=head3 between

Value: 2-element string (C<[ANY_MIN, ANY_MAX]>)

A convenient clause to combine L</min> and L</max>.

Example, the following schemas are equivalent:

 ["float", {"between": [0.0, 1.5]}]
 ["float", {"min": 0.0, "max": 1.5}]

=head3 xbetween

Value: 2-element string (C<[ANY_MIN, ANY_MAX]>)

A convenient clause to combine L</xmin> and L</xmax>.

=head1 TYPE: buf

C<buf> stores binary data. Elements of buf data are bytes. It is derived from
L<str|/"TYPE: str">.

=head1 TYPE: num

C<num> stores numbers. This type assumes the L<Comparable|/"ROLE: Comparable">
and L<Sortable|/"ROLE: Sortable"> roles.

=head1 TYPE: float

C<float> stores real (floating-point) numbers. This type is derived from
L<num|/"TYPE: num">.

=head2 Clauses

=head3 is_nan

Value: bool.

If true, require that number is a NaN (e.g. "NaN" or "-NaN" in Perl). If false,
forbid that the number is a NaN.

=head3 is_inf

Value: bool.

If true, require that number is a positive or negative infinity (e.g. "Inf" or
"-Infinity" in Perl). If false, forbid that the number is an infinity (which can
mean a finite number or a NaN).

=head3 is_pos_inf

Value: bool.

If true, require that number is a positive infinity (e.g. "Inf" or "+Infinity"
in Perl). If false, forbid that number is a positive infinity (which can mean a
finite number, negative infinity, or a NaN).

=head3 is_neg_inf

Value: bool.

If true, require that number is a negative infinity (e.g. "-Inf" or "-Infinity"
in Perl). If false, forbid that number is a negative infinity (which can mean a
finite number, positive infinity, or a NaN).

=head1 TYPE: int

C<int> stores integers. This type is derived from L<num|/"TYPE: num">.

=head2 Clauses

=head3 mod

Value: 2-element array of ints (C<[INT1, INT2]>).

Require that (data mod C<INT1>) equals C<INT2>. For example, C<< "mod": [2, 1]
>> effectively specifies odd numbers.

=head3 div_by

Value: int.

Require that data is divisible by the specified number. This is effectively just
a shortcut for C<< "mod": [INT, 0] >>.

Example: Given schema C<< ["int", {"div_by": 2}] >>, null, 0, 2, 4, and 6 are
valid but 1, 3, 5 are not.

=head1 TYPE: str

C<str> stores strings (text). This type assumes the L<Comparable|/"ROLE:
Comparable">, L<Sortable|/"ROLE: Sortable">, and L<HasElems|/"ROLE: HasElems">
roles (the elements are individual characters, the indices are integers from 0
to (length of string)-1). Default encoding is utf8.

=head2 Clauses

=head3 encoding

Value: str, default C<utf8>.

Specify encoding. Currently the only supported value is C<utf8>.

=head3 match

Value: string (regex) or hash of regexes (C<< REGEX|{COMPILER=>REGEX, ...} >>)

Require that string match the specified regular expression.

Since regular expressions might not be 100% compatible from language to
language, instead of avoiding the use of regex entirely, you can specify
different regex for each target language, e.g.:

 ["str", {"match": {
   "js":     "...",
   "perl":   "...",
   "python": "..."
 }}]

To match against multiple regexes:

 // string must match a, b, and c
 ["str", {"match&": ["a", "b", "c"]}]

 // string must match either a or b or c
 ["str", {"match|": ["a", "b", "c"]}

 // string must NOT match a
 ["str", {"!match": "a"}]

 // string must NOT match a nor b nor c (i.e. must match none of those)
 ["str", {"match": [a, b, c], "match.op": "none"}]

=head3 is_re

Value: bool.

If value is true, require that the string be a valid regular expression string.
If value is false, require that the string not be a valid regular expression
string.

=head1 TYPE: cistr

Just like L<str|/"TYPE: str">, but comparison between values will be done
case-insensitively.

=head1 TYPE: bool

Boolean type. This type assumes the L<Comparable|/"ROLE: Comparable"> and
L<Sortable|/"ROLE: Sortable"> roles.

=head2 Clauses

=head3 is_true

Value: bool.

Require that value is true. This is a more portable way than comparing to a
value using L</is>. To require that value is false, set this clause to a false
value. Alternatively you can also use C<< "!is_true": 1 >>.

=head1 TYPE: array

Array type. This type assumes the L<Comparable|/"ROLE: Comparable"> and
L<HasElems|/"ROLE: HasElems"> roles (the elements are indexed by integers
starting from 0).

=head2 Clauses

=head3 elems

Value: array of schema.

Attributes: C<create_default> (bool, default: 1).

Specify schemas for each element of the array. Example:

 ["array", "elems", ["int*", "float"]]

Valid values include C<[1]>, C<[1, undef]>, C<[1, 1.1]>, C<[1, 1.1, "foo"]>.
Invalid values include C<[]> (first element is a required int), C<[1, "foo"]>
(second element does not validate).

If there are not enough elements in the data, they will be assumed to be C<null>
(undefined value). Extra elements in the data are ignored.

The C<.create_default> attribute regulates whether missing elements should be
set with default values if they do not exist in the data. Example:

 ["array", "elems", ["int*", ["float", "default", 2]]]

In the last example, C<[1]> will become C<[1, 2]> after validation. However
with:

 ["array",
     "elems", ["int*", ["float", "default", 2]],
     "elems.create_default", 0]

C<[1]> will still become C<[1]> after validation. In both cases, C<[1, undef]>
will become C<[1, 2]>.

=head3 of

Value: schema.

This is just an alias to L</each_elem>.

=head1 TYPE: hash

Hash (a.k.a. dictionary) type. This type assumes the L<Comparable/"ROLE:
Comparable"> and L<HasElems|/"ROLE: HasElems"> roles (the elements are hash
values, the indices are hash keys).

=head2 Properties

=head3 keys (hash property)

Value: array.

Alias for L<HasElems|/"ROLE: HasElems">'s L</indices>.

=head3 values (hash property)

Value: array.

Alias for L<HasElems|/"ROLE: HasElems">'s L</elems>.

=head2 Clauses

=head3 keys

Value: hash.

Attributes: C<restrict> (bool, default: 1), C<create_default> (bool, default:
1).

Specify schema for specific pair value. Also, by default, restrict keys of hash
to the list specified in this clause, except if the C<.restrict> attribute is
set to false. Example:

 ["hash*",
     "keys", {
         "name": "str",
         "address": ["any", "of", ["str", ["array", "of", "str"]]],
         "email": "email_address"
     },
 ]

The above schema requires data to be a hash with keys C<name>, C<address>,
C<email>. None of the keys are required to be present (use L</req_keys> for
that), but other keys are not allowed.

Another example:

 ["hash",
     "keys", {"a": "int", "b": "str", "c": "float"},
     "keys.restrict", 0
 ]

The above schema specifies a hash with definition for the value of its C<a>,
C<b>, and C<c> keys. But other keys like C<d> are allowed since the L</keys>
clause is set to not restrict keys.

The C<.create_default> attribute regulates whether keys should be created with
default values if they do not exist in the data. For example:

 ["hash", "keys": {"a": "int", "b": ["int", "default": 2]}]

Given data C<{}>, by default it will be given defaults so it becomes C<{"b":
2}>. C<a> is not created because it does not have a default value. However, if
C<.create_default> is set to false:

 ["hash",
     "keys", {"a": "int", "b": ["int", "default": 2]},
     "keys.create_default", 0
 ]

then C<{}> will still become C<{}> after validation. In both cases, C<{"b":
null}> will still become C<{"b": 2}>.

=head3 re_keys

Value: hash

Attributes: C<restrict> (bool, default: 1)

Just like C<keys>, but specifies schemas for keys which match regexes. Example:

 ["hash", "re_keys", {"^[A-Za-z]": "str", "^[0-9]": "int"}]

The above schema specifies that for keys which begin with a letter the values
must be strings, and for keys which begin with a digit the values must be
integers. These hashes validate: C<< {} >>, C<< {"a": "x", "b": 1, "1": 1} >>.
These hashes do not validate: C<< {"1": "x"} >>, C<< {"#": "x"} >> (key does not
match any keys in L</re_keys>).

=head3 req_keys

Value: array

Specify which keys are required to be exist. Note that the values for those keys
are not required to be defined (use L</keys> for that). Example:

 ["hash", "req_keys", ["a", "b"]]

The above schema specifies that hash needs to have some keys, but the value can
be null. This hash will validate: C<< {"a": 1, "b": null} >>. However, given
this schema:

 ["hash", "req_keys", ["a", "b"], "keys", {"a": "int", "b": "int*"}]

the previous hash will not validate since the value for C<b> is required.

Note: you can also use the L</keys> property to express the same thing, but
L</req_keys> is more convenient:

 ["hash", "prop", ["keys", ["array", "has&", ["a", "b"]]]]

See also: L</allowed_keys>, L</forbidden_keys>.

=head3 allowed_keys

Value: array

Specify which keys are allowed (can exist). Unlike L</req_keys>, keys specified
in the value need not exist. Example:

 ["hash", "allowed_keys", ["a", "b"]]

Then hashes C<{}>, C<{"a":1}>, C<{"a":1,"b":2}> all pass, but C<{"a":1,"c":3}>
fails because it contains keys outside the allowed list.

Note: you can also use the L</keys> property to express the same thing, but
L</allowed_keys> is more convenient:

 ["hash", "prop", ["keys", ["array", "each_elem", ["str", "in", ["a", "b"]]]]]

See also: L</req_keys>, L</forbidden_keys>.

=head3 allowed_keys_re

Value: regex

Like L</allowed_keys> but using regular expression.

=head3 forbidden_keys

Value: array

Specify which keys are forbidden (must not exist). Example:

 ["hash", "forbidden_keys", ["a", "b"]]

Then hashes C<{}>, C<{"c":1}> all pass, but C<{"a":1,"c":3}> fails because it
contains keys in the forbidden list.

Note: you can also use the C<keys> property to express the same thing, but
L</forbidden_keys> is more convenient:

 ["hash", "prop", ["keys", ["array", "each_elem", ["str", "!in", ["a", "b"]]]]]

See also: L</req_keys>, L</allowed_keys>.

=head3 forbidden_keys_re

Value: regex

Like L</forbidden_keys> but using regular expression.

=head3 each_key

Alias for L</each_index>.

=head3 each_value

Alias for L</each_elem>.

=head3 check_each_key

Alias for L</check_each_index>.

=head3 check_each_value

Alias for L</check_each_elem>.

=head3 choose_one_key

Value: array of str.

Specify that hash contains at most one out of a list of key names. Example:

 ["hash", "choose_one_key", ["exclude", "exclude_from"]]

Hash can contain either "exclude" or "exclude_from" but not both.

=head3 choose_one

Alias for L</choose_one_key>.

=head3 choose_all_keys

Value: array of str.

Specify that if hash contains any one of keys in a given list of key names, then
hash must contain all of those keys. Example:

 ["hash", "choose_all_keys", ["password", "confirmation"]]

When hash contains "password", it must also contain "confirmation". And vice
versa.

=head3 choose_all

Alias for L</choose_all_keys>.

=head3 choose_some_keys

Value: 3-element array (C<[MIN, MAX, KEYS]>).

Require that hash has between C<MIN> and C<MAX> of keys in C<KEYS>.

=head3 req_one_key

Value: array of str.

Specify that only exactly one key is required to exist. Example:

 ["hash", "req_one_key", ["input_value", "input_file"]] // either specify input value directly, or specify path to file that contains the value

When the two keys both exist, the clause fails.

=head3 req_one

Alias for L</req_one_key>.

=head3 req_all_keys

Alias for L</req_keys>.

=head3 req_all

Alias for L</req_keys>.

=head3 req_some_keys

Value: 3-element array (C<[MIN, MAX, KEYS]>)

Specify that between C<MIN> and C<MAX> of keys in C<KEYS> are required.

=head3 req_some

Alias for L</req_some_keys>.

=head3 dep_any

Value: 2-element array (C<[ STR|ARRAY[STR], ARRAY[STR] ]>)

Specify that the first argument (either a string containing a key name, or a
list of key names) can only exist when one of the keys given in the second
argument exists. Example:

 ["hash", "dep_any", ["postcode", ["address"]]]

The "postcode" key can only be specified if "address" key exists.

Another example:

 ["hash", "dep_any", ["input_format", ["input_value", "input_file"]]

If "input_value" or "input_file" exists, then "input_format" is allowed to be
specified.

Yet another example:

 ["hash", "dep_any", [["input_format", "input_is_yaml", "input_is_json"], ["input_value", "input_file"]]

If either "input_value" or "input_file" exists, then one of "input_format",
"input_is_yaml", "input_is_json" is allowed to be specified.

=head3 dep_all

Value: 2-element array (C<[ STR|ARRAY[STR], ARRAY[STR] ]>)

Specify that the first argument (either a string containing a key name, or a
list of key names) can only exist when all of the keys given in the second
argument exist. Example:

 ["hash", "dep_all", ["postcode", ["address"]]]

In the above example, you can also use L</dep_any> clause for the same effect
since there is only one key to depend on. Another example:

 ["hash", "dep_all", ["postcode", ["address", "city"]]

In the above example, "postcode" can only be specified when both "address" and
"city" exist. Yet another example:

=head3 req_dep_any

Value: 2-element array (C<[ STR|ARRAY[STR], ARRAY[STR] ]>)

Specify that the first argument (either a string containing a key name, or a
list of key names) is required when one of the keys given in the second argument
exist.

=head3 req_dep_all

Value: 2-element array (C<[ STR|ARRAY[STR], ARRAY[STR] ]>)

Specify that the first argument (either a string containing a key name, or a
list of key names) is required when all of the keys given in the second argument
exist.
