Xymon-Plugin-Server

Xymon-Plugin-Server contains some modules to write Xymon plugins
run at server side.

INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install


HOW TO USE

This section describes basic method to run plugin.

Put following script named 'simple.pl' into $XYMONHOME/ext
($XYMONHOME may be set like "/home/xymon/server")

        use strict;

        use Xymon::Plugin::Server::Dispatch;
        use Xymon::Plugin::Server::Status qw(:colors);

        sub simple_test {
            my ($host, $test, $ip) = @_;

            my $status = Xymon::Plugin::Server::Status->new($host, $test);
            $status->add_status(GREEN, "simple test ok!");
            $status->report;
        }

        my $dispatch = Xymon::Plugin::Server::Dispatch
            ->new(simple => \&simple_test);

        $dispatch->run;

Add new test tag 'simple' to host entry in $XYMONHOME/etc/hosts.cfg like:

        127.0.0.1   localhost.localdomain      # test1 ... testx simple

To run simple.pl periodically, add entry to $XYMOMHOME/etc/tasks.cfg like:

        [simple]
            ENVFILE $XYMONHOME/etc/xymonserver.cfg
            CMD perl $XYMONHOME/ext/simple.pl
            LOGFILE $XYMONSERVERLOGS/simple.log
            INTERVAL 5m

After all, wait for a few minutes until script is invoked.
