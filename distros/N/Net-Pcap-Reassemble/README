This module is a wrapper for the loop() function of the Net::Pcap
module. It performs IP fragment reassembly for fragmented datagrams
in the libpcap dump data. It supports reassembly of IPv4 and IPv6
fragments.

See the Net::Pcap::Reassemble man page that was installed with this
module for information on how to use it in your perl programs. You
require the Net::Pcap module to use Net::Pcap::Reassemble.

Net::Pcap::Reassemble installs without any black magic:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install
