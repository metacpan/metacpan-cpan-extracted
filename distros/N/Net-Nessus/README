NAME
        Net::Nessus::Client - A Nessus client module

SYNOPSIS
        # Connect to the Nessus Server
        require Net::Nessus::Client;
        my $client = Net::Nessus::Client->new('host' => 'localhost',
                                              'port' => '1241',
                                              'user' => 'joe',
                                              'password' => 'my_password');

DESCRIPTION
    The Nessus program is a Client/Server application offering a framework
    for lots of security related scanners, so-called plugins. The idea is
    not to create a separate scanner for any possible security hole, but to
    reimplement only the most important parts and let the Nessus Server
    (nessusd) do the most part of the work.

    Clients are typically available as GUI applications, for example based
    on the GTK (nessus), Java or Win32 applications. This module is another
    Nessus client written in Perl, but without GUI.

    You start using the module by opening a connection to a Nessus Server:
    This will create a Nessus client object for you. This object offers
    methods that you can later use, for example retrieving the list of
    available plugins, start a scan, set preferences and so on.

METHOD INTERFACE
  Creating a client object
      require Net::Nessus::Client;
      my $client = Net::Nessus::Client->new(%attr);

    (Class Method) The new method is the client constructor. It receives a
    set of attributes that are required for opening the connection, for
    example

    A Perl exception is thrown in case of trouble.

    host
    port    Host name (or IP address) and port number of the Nessus servers
            machine. The defaults are *localhost* and *1241*, as accepted by
            the IO::Socket modules *new* constructor. You may as well use
            other attributes of this constructor, for example *Timeout*.
            IO::Socket.

    user
    password
            User name and password to use for logging into the Nessus
            server. There are no defaults, you must set these attributes.

    ntp_proto
            An optional version of the NTP protocol to run. Defaults to the
            highest available number, 1.1 as of this writing.

    Example: Log into the Nessus server running at machine
    "gate.company.com", port 2367 as user "joe" with password
    "what_password" and NTP version 1.0:

      require Net::Nessus::Client;
      my $client = Net::Nessus::Client->new('host' => 'gate.company.com',
                                            'port' => 2367,
                                            'user' => 'joe',
                                            'password' => 'what_password',
                                            'ntp_proto' => '1.0');

  Reading the plugin list
      my $plugins = $self->Plugins();
      my $prefs = $self->Prefs();
      my $rules = $self->Rules();

    (Instance Methods) Read the plugin list, the current preferences or the
    list of rules. The plugin list is an array of hash refs, each hash ref
    with attributes *id*, *category* and so on. The prefs are a single hash
    ref of name/value pairs and the rules are an array ref of strings.

    When talking to an NTP/1.0 server, the Prefs() and Rules() methods will
    return undef.

    Examples:

      my $plugins = $self->Plugins();
      print("The first plugins ID is ", $plugins->[0]->{'id'}, "\n");
      print("The second plugins description is ",
            $plugins->[1]->{'description'}, "\n");
      my $prefs = $self->Prefs();
      print "\nThe current prefs are:\n";
      while (my($var, $val) = each %$prefs) {
        print "  $var = $val\n";
      }
      my $rules = $self->Rules();
      print "\nThe current rules are:\n";
      foreach my $rule (@$rules) {
        print "  $rule\n";
      }

  Sending a message to the server
      $client->Print($msg);

    (Instance Method) The print method is used for sending a previously
    created message to the server. Depending on the message type you should
    continue calling the *GetMsg* method.

    Example:

      my $rules = ['n:*.fr;', 'y:*.my.de;'];
      my $msg = Net::Nessus::Message::Rules($rules);
      $client->print($msg);

  Reading a message from the server
      $msg = $client->GetMsg($type, $timeout);

    (Instance method) The *GetMsg* method is reading a message from the
    server. If the argument $type is undef, then any message is accepted,
    otherwise any message other message type is treated as an error. Valid
    message types are PLUGIN_LIST, PREFERENCES and so on.

    If the argument $timeout is given, then an error will be triggered, if
    the server is not sending any message for that much seconds. If no
    timeout is given, then the default timeout will be used.

  Launching an attack
      my $messages = $client->Attack(@hosts);
      $client->ShowSTATUS($msg);
      $client->ShowPORT($msg);
      $client->ShowHOLE($msg);
      $client->ShowINFO($msg);
      $client->ShowPLUGINS_ORDER($msg);
      $client->ShowBYE($msg);
      $client->ShowERROR($msg);

    (Instance Methods) An attack can be launched by calling the clients
    *Attack* method. While the attack is running, the Nessus server will
    send PLUGINS_ORDER, STATUS, PORT, HOLE and INFO messages and finally a
    BYE message. If the client receives such a message, he will call the
    corresponding Show method, for example *ShowPLUGINS_ORDER* or
    *ShowPORT*.

    The default implementations of these messages will create a hash ref.
    The hash refs keys are port numbers, a special key being the word
    general. The hash refs values are hash refs again, the keys being the
    words PORT, HOLE and INFO. The values are array refs of corresponding
    messages. That is, you find all security holes (if any) of the targets
    FTP port as follows:

      my @ftp_holes = @{$messages->{'21'}->{'PORT'}};

    Finally the hosts are used to build a top hash ref, the values being as
    described above for the respective host.
