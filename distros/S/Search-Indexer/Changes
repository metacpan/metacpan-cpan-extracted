  - Internal structure change : use Btree instead of Hash for
    ixw and ixp. This takes more space but allows us to walk
    through words in the dictionary, or through words in a 
    given doc. INDEXES ARE NOT COMPATIBLE WITH PREVIOUS
    VERSION, you need to reindex your docs.

  - add" method : check that $docId is a fresh number
  - "remove" method : no longer necessary to supply text buffer;
    just give the docId to remove
  - new method "words" and "wordIds"
  - modified "translateQuery" for compatibility with 
    Search::QueryParser v0.91

0.70 Feb 6th. First public release.
