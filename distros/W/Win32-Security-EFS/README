NAME
    Win32::Security::EFS - Perl interface to functions that assist in
    working with EFS (Encrypted File System) under Windows plattforms.

SYNOPSIS
            use Win32::Security::EFS;

            if(Win32::Security::EFS->supported()) {
                    Win32::Security::EFS->encrypt('some/file');
                    Win32::Security::EFS->decrypt('some/file');
            }

DESCRIPTION
    The Encrypted File System, or EFS, was introduced in version 5 of NTFS
    to provide an additional level of security for files and directories. It
    provides cryptographic protection of individual files on NTFS volumes
    using a public-key system. Typically, the access control to file and
    directory objects provided by the Windows security model is sufficient
    to protect unauthorized access to sensitive information. However, if a
    laptop containing sensitive data is lost or stolen, the security
    protection of that data may be compromised. Encrypting the files
    increases security in this scenario.

  METHODS
    supported()
        Returns *true* iff the underlaying filesystem supports EFS

    constant_names()
    encrypt($filename)
        The *encrypt* function encrypts a file or directory. All data
        streams in a file are encrypted. All new files created in an
        encrypted directory are encrypted.

    decrypt($filename)
        The *decrypt* function decrypts an encrypted file or directory.

    encryption_status($filename)
        The *encryption_status* function retrieves the encryption status of
        the specified file.

        If the function succeeds, it will return one of the following values
        see the "CONSTANTS" section.

    encryption_disable($dirpath)
        The *encryption_disable* function disables encryption of the
        specified directory and the files in it. It does not affect
        encryption of subdirectories below the indicated directory.

    encryption_enable($dirpath)
        The *encryption_enable* function enables encryption of the specified
        directory and the files in it. It does not affect encryption of
        subdirectories below the indicated directory.

  FUNCTIONS
    You have the possibility to access the plain API directly. Therefore the
    following functions can be exported:

        use Win32::Security::EFS ':api';

    EncryptFile($filename)
            BOOL EncryptFile(
                LPCTSTR lpFileName  // file name
            );

    DecryptFile($filename, $reserved)
            BOOL DecryptFile(
                LPCTSTR lpFileName,  // file name
                DWORD dwReserved     // reserved; must be zero
            );

    FileEncryptionStatus($filename, \$status)
            BOOL FileEncryptionStatus(
                LPCTSTR lpFileName,  // file name
                LPDWORD lpStatus     // encryption status
            );

    EncryptionDisable($filename, $disable)
            BOOL EncryptionDisable(
                LPCWSTR lpDirPath,
                BOOL fDisable
            );

    QueryUsersOnEncryptedFile( ... )
        Not yet implemented.

CONSTANTS
    You can import all constants by importing Win32::Security::EFS like

            use Win32::Security::EFS ':consts';

    * encryption_status constants

        * *FILE_DIR_DISALLOWED:* Reserved for future use.
        * *FILE_ENCRYPTABLE:* The file can be encrypted.
        * *FILE_IS_ENCRYPTED:* The file is encrypted.
        * *FILE_READ_ONLY:* The file is a read-only file.
        * *FILE_ROOT_DIR:* The file is a root directory. Root directories
        cannot be encrypted.
        * *FILE_SYSTEM_ATTR:* The file is a system file. System files cannot
        be encrypted.
        * *FILE_SYSTEM_DIR:* The file is a system directory. System
        directories cannot be encrypted.
        * *FILE_SYSTEM_NOT_SUPPORT:* The file system does not support file
        encryption.
        * *FILE_UNKNOWN:* The encryption status is unknown. The file may be
        encrypted.
        * *FILE_USER_DISALLOWED:* Reserved for future use.
