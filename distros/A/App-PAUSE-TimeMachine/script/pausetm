=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<pausetm> is a frontend script to get 02packages.details.txt data
provided by PAUSE-git repository at
L<https://github.com/batchpause/PAUSE-git> which has a history of
package list since March 31st, 2012.

Note that this tool is just a frontend tool, and C<cpanm> can utilize
a local C<02packages.details.txt> with its C<--mirror-index>
option without running a web server. Read more details about it at
L<http://weblog.bulknews.net/post/48794875384/freeze-cpan-deps-with-pause-git>

=head1 COMMANDS

=over 4

=item sync

  > pausetm sync

Initializes and synchronizes PAUSE-git. It is just a wrapper for C<git
clone> and C<git pull>. git checkout location can be configured using
C<PAUSETM_GIT_DIR> environment variable, which is set to
C<~/.pausetm/PAUSE-git> by default.

=item cat

  > pausetm cat 2014-02-01

shos the content of C<02packages.details.txt> file on a given
date. The date format accepts whatever C<git rev-list --before>
accepts, such as C<Sep 1 2012> or C<2012-09-01>.

=item server

  > pausetm server

Runs an httpd that serves as a CPAN mirror. To specify options such as
listen port, see L<plackup> man page.

You can access http://localhost:5000/<yyyy>-<mm>-<dd> for example, to
make it work as a CPAN mirror in CPAN clients such as C<cpanm>.
