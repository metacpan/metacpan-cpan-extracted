Tk::CanvasFig
-------------

This module adds a new method fig() to the Tk::Canvas namespace. The
method saves the contents of a canvas as a xfig compatible file.

Example:

    $canvas = $mw->Canvas->pack;
    # Do a lot of drawings
    $canvas->fig(-file     => "test.fig",
                 -imagedir => "test.fig-images");
    # Save the canvas as a xfig file. If there are images, they will
    # be written as XPM files in the -imagedir. Please note that
    # you have to compile XPM support into xfig to actually see the
    # images (by default it is not).

Installation:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make all test install

Note that xfig may fail to load and save files if locale-related
environment variables like LC_ALL are set.
