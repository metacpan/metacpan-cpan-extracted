[Changes for 0.29 - 2008-12-13]

* Publisher and index fixes

* We don't need to force select_timeout anymore, and it causes
  explosions if called during global destruction, when $$self->[0]
  (_part_ of the pseudohash) may have gone missing already, but the
  object itself is still there.  So $$self->{anything} explodes with
  "not a hash reference" _sometimes_, despite $$self always being an
  arrayref.
  ..friends don't let friends use pseudohashes.

* We now require DBM::Deep 1.00 or later.

* Improved data consistency in DBM::Deep backend so it won't sometimes
  die with a "not an ARRAY reference" message.
  Reported by: Matthew Pitts

[Changes for 0.25 - 2007-05-31]
