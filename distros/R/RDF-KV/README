NAME
    RDF::KV - Embed RDF linked data in plain old HTML forms

VERSION
    Version 0.14

SYNOPSIS
        my $kv = RDF::KV->new(
            subject    => $uri,      # ordinarily the Request-URI
            graph      => $graphuri, # URI for the default graph
            namespaces => $ns,       # default namespace prefix map
            callback   => \&rewrite, # form-results-rewriting callback
        );

        # Processes a hashref-of-parameters, like found in Catalyst or
        # Plack::Request. This call will ignore obviously non-matching
        # keys, but will croak on botched attempts to use the protocol.

        my $patch = eval { $kv->process($params) };
        if ($@) {
            # return 409 Conflict ...
        }

        # add/remove statements from the graph
        $patch->apply($model);

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides a reference implementation for the RDF-KV protocol
    <http://doriantaylor.com/rdf-kv>. The objective of this protocol is to
    convey RDF linked data from a web browser to a web server using no
    mechanism beyond conventional "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" HTML
    forms. The overarching purpose is to facilitate the development of
    linked data applications by making the apparatus of JavaScript an
    *optional*, rather than a *mandatory*, consideration.

    This protocol implementation works by culling key-value pairs denoted in
    a prescribed syntax from POSTed form input (parsed by something like
    CGI, Plack::Request or Catalyst), and then stitching them together to
    create a patch object which is then applied to an RDF::Trine::Model
    graph.

METHODS
  new
    Instantiate the object. The following parameters are also (read-only)
    accessors.

    subject
        This is the default subject URI (or blank node).

    graph
        This is the default graph URI.

    namespaces
        This URI::NamespaceMap object will enable URI abbreviation through
        the use of CURIEs in form input.

    callback
        Supply a callback function that will be applied to subject and
        object values, for instance to rewrite a URI. The return value of
        this function must be understood by "add_this" in RDF::KV::Patch.

  process \%CONTENT
    Process form content and return an RDF::KV::Patch object. This is the
    only significant method.
