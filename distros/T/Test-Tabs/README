NAME
    Test::Tabs - check the presence of tabs in your project

SYNOPSIS
            use Test::Tabs tests => 1;
            tabs_ok('lib/Module.pm', 'Module is indented sanely');

    Or

            use Test::Tabs;
            all_perl_files_ok();

    Or

            use Test::Tabs;
            all_perl_files_ok( @mydirs );

DESCRIPTION
    This module scans your project/distribution for any perl files (scripts,
    modules, etc) for the presence of tabs.

    In particular, it checks that all indentation is done using tabs, not
    spaces; alignment is done via spaces, not tabs; indentation levels never
    jump up (e.g. going from 1 tab indent to 3 tab indent without an
    intervening 2 tab indent); and there is no trailing whitespace on any line
    (though lines may consist entirely of whitespace).

    Comment lines and pod are ignored. (A future version may also ignore
    heredocs.)

    A trailing comment `##WS` can be used to ignore all whitespace rules for
    that line. `## no Test::Tabs` can be used to begin ignoring whitespace
    rules for all following lines until `## use Test::Tabs` is seen. `## skip
    Test::Tabs` tells Test::Tabs to skip the current file, but it must be used
    *before* the first whitespace rule violation.

  Functions
    `all_perl_files_ok( @directories )`
        Applies `tabs_ok()` to all perl files found in @directories
        recursively. If no @directories are given, the starting point is one
        level above the current running script, that should cover all the
        files of a typical CPAN distribution. A perl file is *.pl, *.pm,
        *.psgi, *.t, or a file starting with `#!...perl`.

    `tabs_ok( $file, $text )`
        Run a tab check on $file. For a module, either the path
        (`lib/My/Module.pm`) or the package name (`My::Module`) can be used.

        $text is the optional test name.
