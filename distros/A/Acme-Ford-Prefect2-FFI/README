DESCRIPTION

    Alien::Base comprises base classes to help in the construction of
    Alien:: modules. Modules in the Alien namespace are used to locate and
    install (if necessary) external libraries needed by other Perl modules.

    This module is a toy module to test the efficacy of the Alien::Base
    system with its experimental FFI interfaces. This module depends on
    another toy module Acme::Alien::DontPanic2 which provides the needed
    libdontpanic library to be able to tell us the answer to life, the
    universe and everything.
