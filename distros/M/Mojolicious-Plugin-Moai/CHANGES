0.003     2019-12-06 20:43:42-06:00 America/Chicago

    [Added]

    - Added id configuration to table and pager. We will need some way
      to identify our elements when writing tests!
    - Added class configuration to table, thead, columns, and a wrapper.
      This should enable all of the features available to Bootstrap 4's
      table.
    - Added `link_to` for table cells. You can specify a route name, and
      the route will be filled in with data from the current row.

0.002     2019-12-06 10:25:11-06:00 America/Chicago

    [Fixed]

    - Renamed 'cdn' widgets to 'lib'. This better indicates their
      function and allows for more meaningful overriding (if one wants
      to load libraries locally instead of from the CDN)

0.001     2019-12-05 01:19:40-06:00 America/Chicago

    - Initial release
    - Added initial table and pager widgets
    - Added CDN widgets to quickly get up and running
