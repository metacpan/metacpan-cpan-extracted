DESCRIPTION

    POE::Component::CPAN::Reporter is a POE-based framework around CPAN and
    CPAN::Reporter. It receives submissions from other POE sessions, spawns
    a POE::Wheel::Run to deal with running CPAN::Reporter, captures the
    output and returns the results to the requesting session.

    Only one job request may be processed at a time. If a job is in
    progress, any jobs submitted are added to a pending jobs queue.

    By default the component uses POE::Wheel::Run to fork another copy of
    the currently executing perl, worked out from $^X. You can specify a
    different perl executable to use though. MSWin32 users please see the
    section of this document relating to your platform.

    You are responsible for installing and configuring CPAN and
    CPAN::Reporter and setting up a suitable perl smoking environment.

DEPRECATION NOTICE

    POE::Component::CPAN::Reporter has been superceded by
    POE::Component::SmokeBox. The minireporter script has been superceded
    by App::SmokeBox::Mini.

    Consider this module deprecated.

CONSTRUCTOR

    spawn

      Spawns a new component session and waits for requests. Takes the
      following optional arguments:

        'alias', set an alias to send requests to later;
        'options', specify some POE::Session options;
        'debug', see lots of text on your console;
        'idle', adjust the job idle time ( default: 600 seconds ), before jobs get killed;
        'timeout', adjust the total job runtime ( default: 3600 seconds ), before a job is killed;
        'perl', which perl executable to use as a default, instead of S^X;
        'reporterdir', default path where CPAN::Reporter should look for it's config.ini file;
        'no_grp_kill', set to a true value to disable process group kill;

      Returns a POE::Component::CPAN::Reporter object.

METHODS

    session_id

      Returns the POE::Session ID of the component's session.

    pending_jobs

      In a scalar context returns the number of currently pending jobs. In
      a list context, returns a list of hashrefs which are the jobs
      currently waiting in the job queue.

    current_job

      Returns a hashref containing details of the currently executing smoke
      job. Returns undef if there isn't a job currently running.

    current_log

      Returns an arrayref of log output from the currently executing smoke
      job. Returns undef if there isn't a job currently running.

    shutdown

      Terminates the component. Any pending jobs are cancelled and the
      currently running job is allowed to complete gracefully. Requires no
      additional parameters.

    pause_queue

      Pauses processing of the jobs. The current job will finish
      processing, but any pending jobs will not be processed until the
      queue is resumed. This does not affect the continued submission of
      jobs to the queue.

    resume_queue

      Resumes the processing of the pending jobs queue if it has been
      previously paused.

    paused

      Returns a true value if the job queue is paused or a false value
      otherwise.

    statistics

      Returns some statistical that the component gathers. In a list
      context returns a list of data. In a scalar context returns an
      arrayref of the said data.

      The data is returned in the following order:

        The time in epoch seconds when the smoker was started;
        The total number of jobs that have been processed;
        The current average job run time;
        The minimum job run time observed;
        The maximum job run time observed;

INPUT EVENTS

    All the events that the component will accept (unless noted otherwise )
    require one parameter, a hashref with the following keys defined (
    mandatory requirements are shown ):

      'event', an event name for the results to be sent to (Mandatory);
      'module', a module to test, this is passed to CPAN's test() method
                so whatever that requires should work (Mandatory);
      'session', which session the result event should go to (Default is the sender);
      'perl', which perl executable to use (Default whatever is in $^X);
      'debug', turn on or off debugging information for this particular job;
      'reporterdir', the path where CPAN::Reporter should look for it's config.ini file;

    It is possible to pass arbitrary keys in the hash. These should be
    proceeded with an underscore to avoid possible future API clashes.

    submit

    push

      Inserts the requested job at the end of the queue ( if there is one
      ).

    unshift

      Inserts the requested job at the head of the queue ( if there is one
      ). Guarantees that that job is processed next.

    shutdown

      Terminates the component. Any pending jobs are cancelled and the
      currently running job is allowed to complete gracefully. Requires no
      additional parameters.

    check

      Checks whether CPAN::Reporter is installed. Takes one parameter a
      hashref with the following keys defined:

        'event', an event name for the results to be sent to (Mandatory);
        'session', which session the result event should go to (Default is the sender);
        'perl', which perl executable to use (Default whatever is in $^X);

      It is possible to pass arbitrary keys in the hash. These should be
      proceeded with an underscore to avoid possible future API clashes.

    indices

      Forces an update of the CPAN indices. Takes one parameter, a hashref
      with the following keys defined:

        'event', an event name for the results to be sent to (Mandatory);
        'session', which session the result event should go to (Default is the sender);
        'perl', which perl executable to use (Default whatever is in $^X);
        'prioritise', set to 1 to put action at the front of the job queue, default 0;

      It is possible to pass arbitrary keys in the hash. These should be
      proceeded with an underscore to avoid possible future API clashes.

OUTPUT EVENTS

    Resultant events will have a hashref as ARG0. All the keys passed in as
    part of the original request will be present (including arbitrary
    underscore prefixed ones), with the addition of the following keys:

      'log', an arrayref of STDOUT and STDERR produced by the job;
      'PID', the process ID of the POE::Wheel::Run;
      'status', the $? of the process;
      'submitted', the time in epoch seconds when the job was submitted;
      'start_time', the time in epoch seconds when the job started running;
      'end_time', the time in epoch seconds when the job finished;
      'idle_kill', only present if the job was killed because of excessive idle;
      'excess_kill', only present if the job was killed due to excessive runtime;

    The results of a 'recent' request will be same as above apart from an
    additional key:

      'recent', an arrayref of recently uploaded modules;

    The results of a 'package' or 'author' search will be same as other
    events apart from an additional key:

      'results', an arrayref of the modules returned by the search;

MSWin32

    POE::Component::CPAN::Reporter now supports MSWin32 in the same manner
    as other platforms. Win32::Process is used to fix the issues
    surrounding POE::Wheel::Run and forking alternative copies of the perl
    executable.

    The code is still experimental though. Be warned.

KUDOS

    Many thanks to all the people who have helped me with developing this
    module.

    Especially to Andreas J. König for CPAN and David Golden for
    CPAN::Reporter
