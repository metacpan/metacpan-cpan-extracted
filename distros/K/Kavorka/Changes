0.036	2014-11-01

 - Updated: Switch from Sub::Name+Sub::Identify to the shiny new Sub::Util.

0.033	2014-08-22

 [ Bug Fixes ]
 - Type::Registry::DWIM changed its API. (Kavorka probably shouldn't be
   using it anyway because it's an undocumented internal part of
   Type::Utils.)

 - Updated: Cope with changes to Exporter::Tiny; avoid triggering warnings.

0.030	2014-03-20

 [ Bug Fixes ]
 - Eliminate dependency on Devel::Pragma, which fixes Kavorka on threaded
   Perls.
   Fixes RT#94015.
   Piers Cawley++
   <https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=94015>

 [ Test Suite ]

   Aaron James Trevena++
   <http://purl.org/NET/cpan-uri/rt/ticket/94015>

0.029	2014-02-26

 - Added: Kavorka::TraitFor::Sub::begin.

0.028	2014-02-21	The 'perlsub-compat' Release

 [ Test Suite ]
 - Add test cases covering bare @ and % sigils.

 [ Other ]
 - Allow attributes to *precede* signatures.
 - Make parsing of parameter defaults laxer so that an equals sign followed
   by no expression is allowed.

0.027	2014-01-30

 - Minor change to the hook allowing keywords to deal with calls that
   bypass the Perl keyword API.

0.026	2014-01-30

 - Allow keywords to detect when the keyword sub has been called in a way
   that bypasses the Perl keyword API's custom parsing (e.g. using a
   prototype, or as a coderef). By default, keywords croak when this is
   detected.
 - Method modifier keywords can now detect when the keyword sub has been
   called bypassing custom parsing, and act sanely rather than croaking.

0.025	2013-12-23

 [ Bug Fixes ]
 - Value constraints for parameters without type constraints were being
   ignored.

 [ Test Suite ]

   Method::Signatures.

 [ Other ]
 - Added: Kavorka::TraitFor::Sub::fresh.
 - Added: Kavorka::TraitFor::Sub::override.

0.021	2013-11-30

 [ Documentation ]
 - Rearrange some of the traits documentation.

 [ Other ]
 - Added: Implement a `ref_alias` trait, inspired by Method::Signatures.
 - Disallow the `assumed` parameter trait for multi subs.
 - Split out most of the implementation for the `optional` trait (except
   for special parsing rules) into Kavorka::TraitFor::ReturnType::optional.
 - Split out some sanity_check stuff into the trait modules.

0.020	2013-11-27

 [ Documentation ]
 - Explain different ways to extend Kavorka.

 [ Other ]
 - Added: Kavorka::TraitFor::Parameter::assumed.
 - Can now use 'but' as another alias for 'is'/'does'.
 - Split out the assumed trait for return types as
   Kavorka::TraitFor::ReturnType::assumed.
 - Subs can now have traits.

0.019	2013-11-23

 - Added: Provide an `augment` keyword which will work in Moose/Mouse, but
   not Moo.
 - Added: Provide an `override` keyword which will work in Moose/Mouse, but
   not Moo.
 - Allow named parameters to be passed in as a hashref rather than a hash.
 - Split out some of the Kavorka::Parameter features (aliases, locked
   hashrefs, read-only parameters) into parameter traits.

0.018	2013-11-18

 - Allow non-Type::Tiny type constraints to be returned by type constraint
   expressions, provided they can be converted to Type::Tiny objects via
   Types::TypeTiny::to_TypeTiny.

0.017	2013-11-18

 - Extensibility via parameter traits.
 - Rename Kavorka::Signature::Parameter -> Kavorka::Parameter.
 - Rename Kavorka::Signature::ReturnType -> Kavorka::ReturnType.

0.016	2013-11-07

 [ Bug Fixes ]
 - Bypass the Internals::SvREADONLY prototype because handling of the ($;$)
   prototype changed in 5.16.0 and we were relying on the new behaviour.

0.015	2013-11-07

 [ BACK COMPAT ]
 - Change the syntax of lexical functions and methods to include the `my`
   keyword in their declaration.

 [ Bug Fixes ]
 - $sub->signature now returns undef if no signature was given in the
   declaration.
 - Most of the closure issues associated with Parse::Keyword are now worked
   around.

 [ Documentation ]
 - Document that fun ($x, $y=$x) {...} doesn't work how you might expect it
   to, and some work-arounds.

 [ Test Suite ]
 - Tidy up some of the closure tests.

 [ Other ]
 - Checking if @_ < 0 is silly; stop doing that.

0.014	2013-11-05	Gunpowder, treason and plot

 - Added: Lexical functions and methods.
 - Added: Return types, optionally with coercion.
 - Updated: Work with (and indeed require Type::Tiny 0.032).

0.013	2013-10-27

 [ Bug Fixes ]
 - Compiled dispatchers introduced in Kavorka 0.012 are essentially a form
   of cache. No cache invalidation was in place, leading to issues when
   adding extra same-named multi method candidates to parent classes after
   a multi method had already been invoked in a child class. Cache
   invalidation now works.

 [ Test Suite ]
 - Test for cache invalidation of compiled multi sub dispatchers.
 - Test that definition of multi subs happens at runtime, and definition
   can continue even after the multi sub has been invoked.

0.012	2013-10-26

 [ Documentation ]
 - Various documentation improvements.

 [ Other ]
 - Optimization: avoid double type checks in multi subs.
 - Optimization: compile dispatchers for multi subs on demand.

0.011	2013-10-25

 [ Documentation ]
 - Split up documentation into a manual with bite-sized chunks.

 [ Other ]
 - Allow multiple method names to be modified with a single method
   modifier.
 - Rename ${^NEXT} variable to $next for `around` method modifiers.
 - Support Perl 5.20 style :prototype(...) attribute.

0.010	2013-10-23

 - Allow package variables such as $Foo::Bar in signatures.
 - General refactoring of variable name parsing.
 - Support 'my' and 'our' prefixes to variable names in signatures.
