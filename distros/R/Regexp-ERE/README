OVERVIEW

Pure perl module for:

  - Parsing POSIX Extended Regular Expressions (ERE) into
    Non-Deterministic Finite Automata (nfa)

  - Manipulating nfa (and-ing, or-ing, concatenating)
    and inspecting them (transparent, documented data structure)

  - Computing Deterministic Finite Automata (dfa) from nfa
    (powerset construction)

  - Computing minimal dfa from dfa
    (Hopcrofts's algorithm)

  - Computing ERE or Perl Regular Expressions from nfa or dfa
    (Warshall algorithm)

  - Heuristically deriving from a nfa or dfa (possibly weaker) constraints
    suitable for display in a graphical user interface,
    i.e. a sequence of widgets of type 'free text' and 'drop down';
    Example: '^(abc|def).*' => $nfa => [['abc', 'def'], 'free text']
