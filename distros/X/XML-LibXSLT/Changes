        - https://mail.gnome.org/archives/xml/2014-February/msg00000.html
        - Caused some failures which were ultimately our fault.

1.76    2012-01-12

    - In the process made "Encode" and perl-5.8.1. pre-requisites of this
    distribution.

    - Add the "make runtest" and "make distruntest" targets to test using
    Test-Run.

1.73    2011-10-09
    - Possible fix for https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=71456 :

1.72    2011-10-06
    - Moved the benchmarking code under benchmark/ so it won't be indexed
    by CPAN (Tim Brody).
    - Avoid leaking memory inside extension elements by cleaning up on
    stylesheet DESTROY (Tim Brody).

    $stylesheet->register_function() method with the same arguments as
    XML::LibXSLT->register_function(). (Tim Brody)
    - Added support for register_element() on stylesheet objects. The callback
    may leak memory though - nothing frees the _private attributes of the
    node + document owner for the passed arguments? (Tim Brody)

1.71    2011-09-10
    - Fixed https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=50487 :

    - Fixed https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=52422 :
        - Unexpected webserver dependency in test
    - Updated the version control instructions in the README to bitbucket.org.
