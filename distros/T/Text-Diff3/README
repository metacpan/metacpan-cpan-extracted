Text-Diff3 version 0.10
============================

Perl module to compute three way diff from texts.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

In most cases, merge.pl and diff3 -m output same result without
diff3 -m making conflict for same removing lines both 0.txt and 1.txt (why?).
merge.pl does not treat conflict in such case.

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires no other modules and libraries.
