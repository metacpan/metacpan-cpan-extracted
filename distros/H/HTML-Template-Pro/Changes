	- fixed cpan rt #38486 (mixed loops && global_var=1)

0.76 Sat Jul 11 10:46:27 EEST 2009
	- work towards stable backend API. 
	Current perl wrapper (Pro.xs) had to communicate with 
	c backend using the param {...} struct(ure).
	That's still bearable if library is statically built in wrapper
	but unacceptable for public library that can be used by third-pary 
	software (the layout of the structure is not a public API. 
	It is not meant to be and is subject to change without prior notice).
	Instead, param structure is hidden behind the stable 
	public library API getter and setter functions.
	tmplpro.h is now the API header.

0,77 Tue Jul 21 20:45:48 EEST 2009
	- major API cleanups
	- concept mono wrapper (requested by Robert Henniger)

0.80 Thu Jul 23 20:08:47 EEST 2009
	- added sypport for dynamically-linked perl wrapper.
	- C library is clearly separated from perl
	The main idea is following:
	Core C library should be as language neutral
	and portable as possible.

	As ANSI C lack standard map types,
	the code was designed so that wrapper should use
	its own language spacific (as Perl built-in hash)
	or library specific (C+glib, for example)
	HashOfHash type, and should provide abstract
	HashOfHash getters to the core C library
	as well as some other system specific calls.
	- released separate public backend library.
	(libhtmltmplpro.so.0.0.0, htmltmplpro.dll).
	- explicitly stated "LGPL or Artistic" license for the library.

0.81 Tue Jul 28 14:26:01 EEST 2009
