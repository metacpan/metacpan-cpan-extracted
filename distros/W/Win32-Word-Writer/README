NAME
    Win32::Word::Writer - Create Microsoft Word documents

DESCRIPTION
    Easily create MS Word documents, abstracting away the Word.Application
    DOM interface and all the required workarounds. The DOM interface is
    still exposed for doing more fancy stuff.

SYNOPSIS
        use strict;
        use Win32::Word::Writer;

        my $oWriter = Win32::Word::Writer->new();

        #Adding text and paragraphs with different styles
        $oWriter->WriteParagraph("Example document", heading => 1);          #Heading  level 1
        $oWriter->WriteParagraph("Usage", style => "Heading 2");             #Style "Heading 2"
        $oWriter->WriteParagraph("Write sentences to the document using a"); #Normal
        $oWriter->WriteParagraph("heading level, or Normal
        if none is specified. ");                            #\n is new paragraph

        $oWriter->Write("Add some more text the current paragraph");

        $oWriter->NewParagraph(style => "Envelope Return");  #The style must exist
        $oWriter->Write("Return to sender. ");

        $oWriter->SetStyle("Envelope Address");              #Change the current style
        $oWriter->Write("Nope, we changed the style of the entire paragraph");
        $oWriter->Write("to a footer style");

        #Setting character styles
        $oWriter->WriteParagraph("Some more normal text. ");
        $oWriter->SetStyle("Hyperlink");                 #A charachter style
        $oWriter->Write("http://www.DarSerMan.com/Perl/");
        $oWriter->ClearCharacterFormatting();            #Clear character style
        $oWriter->Write("  <-- my ");

        #Bold/Italics
        $oWriter->ToggleBold();         #Toggle bold
        $oWriter->Write("Perl ");
        $oWriter->SetItalic(1);         #Turn on Italic
        $oWriter->Write("stuff.");
        $oWriter->ToggleItalic();       #Toggle Italic
        $oWriter->SetBold(0);           #Turn off bold

        #Bullet point lists
        $oWriter->ListBegin();
        $oWriter->ListItem();
        $oWriter->Write("The first bullet item");
        $oWriter->ListItem();
        $oWriter->Write("The second bullet item");

        $oWriter->ListBegin();   #Nested bullet point list
        $oWriter->ListItem();
        $oWriter->Write("The first inner bullet item");
        $oWriter->ListItem();
        $oWriter->Write("The second inner bullet item");

        $oWriter->ListEnd();
        $oWriter->ListEnd();


        #Do this at regular intervals (say, every couple of 10K of text you add)
        $oWriter->Checkpoint();


        #Tables
        $oWriter->WriteParagraph("Table example", heading => 1);
        $oWriter->NewParagraph();

        $oWriter->TableBegin();
        $oWriter->TableRowBegin();
        $oWriter->TableColumnBegin();
        $oWriter->SetBold(1);
        $oWriter->Write("HTML table");
        $oWriter->TableColumnBegin();
        $oWriter->Write("Win32::Word::Writer");

        $oWriter->TableRowBegin();
        $oWriter->TableColumnBegin();
        $oWriter->SetBold(0);
        $oWriter->Write("<table>");
        $oWriter->TableColumnBegin();
        $oWriter->Write("TableBegin()");

        $oWriter->TableRowBegin();
        $oWriter->TableColumnBegin();
        $oWriter->Write("<tr>");
        $oWriter->TableColumnBegin();
        $oWriter->Write("TableRowBegin()");

        $oWriter->TableEnd();


        #Save the document
        $oWriter->SaveAs("01example.doc");

INSTALLATION
    With <Strawberry Perl>, the regular CPAN shell should work:

      cpan Win32::Word::Writer

    All dependencies except Microsoft Word itself should sort itself out
    automatically.

    This may work with ActiveState too if you have the MinGW compiler, or it
    might be easier to install with "ppm" (if available, I'm not sure about
    the state of the PPM repos at this point).

CONCEPTS
    Win32::Word::Writer uses an OLE instance of Word to create Word
    documents.

    The documents are constructed in a linear fashion, i.e. you add text to
    the document and generally don't move around the document a lot.

  Styles
    A "style" in Word is a set of properties that can be assigned to a piece
    of text. There are two types of styles: Paragraph and Character styles.

    "Normal", and "Heading 1" are example of paragraph styles.

    When a paragraph gets applied to a piece of text it applies to the
    entire paragraph, whereas the character style only affects the actual
    chars. You can see the difference if you open a Word document and look
    at the available styles.

PROPERTIES
  oWord
    A Win32::OLE object with a Word Application instance.

  oDocument
    A Win32::OLE object with the Application's Document object. Often used
    shorthand.

  oSelection
    A Win32::OLE object with the Application's Selection object.

  oTable
    The current Win32::Word::Writer::Table object, if a table is being
    created, or undef if not.

METHODS
    Note that all methods return 1 or die on errors, unless otherwise
    stated.

  new()
    Create new Word Writer object which can be written to.

    Return new object, or die on errors.

  init()
    Init the object. Called by new.

  Open($file)
    Discard the current document and open the Word document in $file.

    Note that you may want to MoveToEnd() after opening an existing document
    before adding new text.

    Note that this object is in an unusable state if the Open fails to load
    a document.

  SaveAs($file, %hOpt)
    Save the document to $file (may be a relative file name). %hOpt is:

      format => $format -- Save $file as $format (default:
      Document). Valid values are: Document, DOSText, DOSTextLineBreaks,
      EncodedText, HTML, RTF, Template, Text, TextLineBreaks, UnicodeText

    (A common mistake is to inspect the document in another Word instance
    when re-running a script. The document will be locked by Word and the
    script can't re-create the file.)

  Checkpoint()
    Checkpoint the document, i.e. save it to a temp file.

    This is necessary to do sometimes because Word seems to keep state until
    the document is saved, and when using Word automation you tend to
    exercise the application in ways they haven't tested properly. And after
    a while you get weird errors, just because Word couldn't deal with all
    that information.

    So you should call this after adding, say, 20K of text to the document
    (this is true for Word 2000, it may be better in later versions).

  Close()
    Discard the current document no-questions-asked (i.e. even if it's not
    saved).

    Note that this object is in an unusable state until a new document is
    created or opened.

METHODS - ADDING TEXT
  Write($text)
    Append $text to the document (using the current style etc).

  WriteParagraph($text, [heading => $level], [style => $name])
    Append $text as a new paragraph of heading $level or style $name. The
    style overrides heading. The style should be a paragraph style.

    The default style is "Normal".

  NewParagraph([heading => $level], [style => $name])
    Start a new paragraph of heading $level or with style $name. The style
    overrides heading. The style should be a paragraph style.

    The default style is "Normal".

  SetStyle([$style = "Normal"])
    Set the style to $style.

    If $style is a paragraph style, it will change the style of the current
    paragraph.

    If $style is a character style, it will turn on that style. It will be
    in effect until a new style is set somehow, or until it's cleared with
    ClearCharacterFormatting().

  ClearCharacterFormatting()
    Clear the characther formatting/set it to default.

    The paragraph can have a style, and individual characters a separate
    formatting style.

  StyleSpec([heading => $level], [style => $name])
    Return the final style, given a specification of heading $level or style
    $name. The style overrides heading.

    The default style is "Normal".

  ToggleBold()
    Toggle the current Bold charachter setting

  SetBold($enable)
    Set the Bold status to 1 or 0.

    Return the new Bold state, or throw OLE exception.

  ToggleItalic()
    Toggle the current Italic charachter setting

  SetItalic($enable)
    Set the Italic status to 1 or 0.

    Return the new Italic state, or throw OLE exception.

METHODS - BULLET POINT LISTS
  ListBegin()
    Begin a new bullet point list.

    Can be nested to create sub-lists.

    Use ListItem() to create new bullet points before adding text to the
    list.

  ListItem()
    Start a new bullet point in the list.

    The first text you Write() after this becomes the new bullet text.

    You should not WriteParagraph() within a list item. New paragraphs are
    signals to Word to advance to the next list item, so that will confuse
    Win32::Word::Writer and/or Word.

  ListEnd()
    End an existing bullet point list.

    If it's the outermost list, go back to normal text.

METHODS - TABLES
  TableBegin()
    Begin a new table.

    The table model resembles a HTML table with rows and columns, but you
    don't have to close columns or rows. Simply start a new one.

    A row and col must be created with TableRowBegin() and
    TableColumnBegin() before any text is added.

    Tables can not be nested.

    Note that tables are rather fragile so don't expect them to work with
    very complex layouts, or very wide columns. Prepare for exceptions to be
    thrown.

  TableRowBegin()
    Begin a new row in the current table.

    Add a column also before adding text to the table.

  TableColumnBegin()
    Begin a column in the current table in the current row.

    Any new text/paragraph added to the document will end up in this table
    cell until a new row or column is created, or the table is ended.

  TableEnd()
    Begin a column in the current table in the current row.

    Any new text/paragraph added to the document will end up in this table
    cell until a new row or column is created, or the table is ended.

METHODS - MOVEMENT AND SELECTION
  MoveToEnd()
    Set the insertion point at the end of the document.

  SelectAll()
    Make the selection the entire document.

    Return 1 on success, else die.

METHODS - FIELDS AND TABLES
  FieldsUpdate()
    Update the fields in the entire document. Retain the current cursor
    location.

    But note this doesn't always work with Table of Contents tables.

    Return 1 on success, else die.

  ToCUpdate()
    Update both entries and page numebers of all the Tables of Contents in
    the entire document. Retain the current cursor location.

    Return 1 on success, else die.

METHODS - IMAGES
  InsertPicture($file, $embed = 0)
    Insert the picture $file at the current cursor location. $file must be
    one Word supports.

    If $embed is 1, the picture $file itself will be embedded inside the
    Word document. If $embed is 0, the picture is isn't embedded in the
    document, but linked to it.

    Return 1 on success, else die.

METHODS - BOOKMARKS
  BookmarkAdd($name)
    Add a new bookmark called $name at the current cursor location.

    Return 1 on success, else die.

  BookmarkGoto($name)
    Go to bookmark called $name. The bookmark should exist.

    Return 1 on success, else die.

  BookmarkDelete($name)
    Delete bookmark called $name. The bookmark should exist.

    Return 1 on success, else die.

METHODS - UTILITY
  MarkDocumentAsSaved()
    Mark the Word document as "saved". This is in effect until the document
    is changed again.

    Being saved e.g. means it can be abandoned without questions.

    Return 1 on success, else die.

  GetFileTemp()
    Return a temporary file name in fileTemp().

  DESTROY
    Release objects including the OLE Word object.

KNOWN BUGS
  Supressing dialog boxes
    The most serious problem I have with Word is that the documented way of
    supressing interactive dialog boxes... doesn't work! This is worked
    around in a few cases (see below), but mostly it's broken.

    I don't know if this only goes for my Office 2000 Word, but it may
    affect you too.

    It's a very bad thing anyhow, since it can cause your program to just
    freeze, waiting for user interaction. To boot, the dialog boxes are
    usually displayed below other applications.

    I blame Bill's minions.

  Only four columns in tables
    It might be that your version of Word only supports four columns. Using
    Word 2003, adding a fifth column results in:

      This exceeds the maximum width.

    This is described in <http://support.microsoft.com/kb/253600/>.
    Unfortunately(?), this doesn't happen when I use Word interactively,
    only under OLE Automation. The suggestions in the KB article won't solve
    the problem.

    In Word 2000 this wasn't a problem. It may be fixed in later versions.
    Who knows?

  OLE errors during global destruction
    If you are in the middle of a table and something goes wrong, there will
    be strange OLE warnings during global destruction. I haven't found out
    why this happens.

  Layout too complex
    I have run into this problem where, despite the no-don't- show-dialogs,
    Word pops up an error dialog below all other windows (so you can't see
    it, great!).

    After clicking Ok in this dialog a number of times, the OLE call finally
    fails properly and dies in the Perl application layer.

    http://support.microsoft.com/kb/292174

    The only way to not run into this problem seems to be to save the
    document to disk after adding some text. The Checkpoint() method does
    this for you.

  Rouge WINWORD.EXE processes
    Sometimes it seems like Win32::OLE has some problems with closing the
    Word instance during global destruction. This happens mostly when things
    die().

TODO
    Tests for Tables of Contents etc

    Tests for Bookmarks

APPLICATION DOM INFORMATION
    So what does the Word DOM look like? Actually, the documentation is
    available when installing Office.

    Start Word and press Alt-F11 to bring up the VBA window. There is an
    Object Browser in the toolbar. Select an object, method or property and
    press F1 to bring up the help.

    A good way to figure out how to do something is to record a Macro and
    then bring up the VBA window and inspect the code written by the Macro
    Recorder.

DESIGN ISSUES
  Software versions
    This is tested and developed using w2k and Office 2000. Things may be
    different with other versions. Please let me know.

  Supressing the "Save as..." dialog box
    The problem with this is that it doesn't work to follow the manual and
    advice found on the Net.

    The usual answer is to set DisplayAlerts to False, or wdAlertsNone. That
    doesn't work for me.

    What works is to set the Document.Saved property to False before
    quitting (the MarkDocumentAsSaved() method).

    That's why the ActiveX object is Quit from the DESTROY method, and not
    using the exit handler in CreateObject which is the normal course of
    action.

GOOD IDEAS
  Keep an eye on the Task Manager
    When you fiddle around with this program, it's useful to keep the Task
    Manager window open to keep track of any WINWORD.EXE processes that may
    be stuck in memory if you e.g. C-Break out of the script (don't do that,
    Win32::OLE won't have a chance of cleaning up the Word instance it
    created).

    Kill abandoned Word processes (but make sure you don't kill any
    documents you may be editing :)

EXTENDING THE MODULE
    The interface of this module is spotty in an opportunistic way; I have
    added utility methods as I needed them.

    If you need to add your own methods, I suggest you simply inject them in
    this namespace to get your application working and send me a patch.

    If you don't know how to create a patch file, just send me the code in
    an email, or the changed source file as an attachment.

    If you write something non-trivial, I'd like some tests to go with it
    too, thanks!

FAQ
    Actual questions. Some of them even frequent.

  Do I need Windows to run Win32::Word::Writer or does it work on Linux?
    Yes, you do need Windows. Win32::Word::Writer is using the actual
    Microsoft Word program installed on your computer.

  Can Win32::Word::Writer do X?
    If you can't find it described in the docs, probaby not. But if you've
    seen it done in Word, it's clearly doable somehow (modulo Word bugs
    courtesy of MS).

    You can probably implement it yourself if you give it a try. Read the
    Win32::Word::Writer source for hints on how to accomplish things.

  Can you implement X for me?
    No, not really.

    I rarely touch this project nowadays, and I don't think I've actually
    used it after the initial thing I needed to write it for years ago.

    I'm happy that others find it useful though.

    If you find it so useful that you need it to do more things, I urge you
    to give it a shot at adding the functionality yourself.

  If so many people e-mail you to say they like Win32::Word::Writer, why are there no reviews?
    (okay, so this is my question)

    Maybe they don't know the link to the <CPAN Reviews site>.
