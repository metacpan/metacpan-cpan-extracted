NAME
    Pod::Weaver::Plugin::Rinci - Insert stuffs to POD from Rinci metadata

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.77 of Pod::Weaver::Plugin::Rinci (from
    Perl distribution Pod-Weaver-Plugin-Rinci), released on 2017-07-07.

SYNOPSIS
    In your weaver.ini:

     [-Rinci]
     ;exclude_modules = REGEX
     ;exclude_files = REGEX

DESCRIPTION
    This plugin inserts stuffs to POD documentation based on information
    found on Rinci metadata.

  For modules
    For modules, the following are inserted:

    *   DESCRIPTION

        From "description" property from package metadata, if any.

    *   FUNCTIONS

        Documentation for each function for which the metadata is found
        under the package will be added here. For each function, there will
        be summary, description, usage, list of arguments and their
        documentation, as well as examples, according to what's available in
        the function metadata of corresponding function.

    To get Rinci metadata from a module, Perinci::Access::Perl is used.

  For Perinci::CmdLine-based CLI script
    For scripts using Perinci::CmdLine (or its variant ::Any and ::Lite),
    the following are inserted:

    *   SYNOPSIS

        If the script's POD does not yet have this section, this section
        will be added containing the usage line of the script.

    *   DESCRIPTION

        If the script's POD does not already have this section, and if the
        script does not have subcommands, description from function metadata
        will be inserted here, if any.

    *   SUBCOMMANDS

        If the script's POD does not already have his section, and if the
        script has subcommands, then each subcommand will be listed here
        along with its summary and description.

    *   OPTIONS

        If the script's POD does not already have his section, command-line
        options for the script will be listed here. If script has
        subcommands, the options will be categorized per subcommand.

    *   CONFIGURATION

        If the script's POD does not already have his section, general
        information about configuration files and available configuration
        parameters will be listed here. If script has subcommands, the
        parameters will be categorized per subcommand.

    *   FILES

        Configuration files read by script will be listed here.

    To get Perinci::CmdLine object information (which contains the URL of
    the Rinci function, or the list of subcommands, among others), the
    script is run with a patched "run()" that will dump the content of the
    object and exit immediately, so the plugin can inspect it.

    Caveats: 1) Function used by the script must reside in the module, not
    embedded inside the script itself, otherwise it will not be readable by
    the plugin. 2) Coderef "subcommands" is not supported.

    To exclude a script from being processed, you can also put "#
    NO_PWP_RINCI" in the script.
