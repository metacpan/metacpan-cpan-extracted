1.25    Aug 27, 2025

        Improved testing

1.26    Aug 28, 2025

        Apparently my new testing methodology ticked off some CPAN testers.
        So I'll relax them a bit.

        Changed the license.

1.27    Aug 10, 2025

        Fixed a runaway loop in "-t" output.
        
        Removed the "one character at a time" output left over from the

        Updated the documentation to be better informative on CPAN.

1.29    Sept 26, 2025

        More tokens and RGB color handling.

        Fixed ALL POD issues.  Ugh.

1.36    Oct 28, 2025

        Changed the tokens and help screen.  Added more descriptions including
        Indication of original 16 colors for limited terminals.

1.37    Oct 29, 2025

        Tokens output defaults to only the 16 colors and the new "expanded"
        option will show all color tokens.
        
        Unicode output defaults to a squashed output and the new "expanded"
        option will show dividers between each row to better discern symbol
        output.

1.38    Oct 30, 2025

        Added more frame styles

1.39    Oct 30, 2025

        Added even more frame styles

1.40    Nov 02, 2025

        The "expanded" option is removed.  It now depends on the COLORTERM
        environment variable and the "truecolor" value.

1.41    Nov 02, 2025

        Version 1.40 removed from CPAN.  The "--expanded" option re-added.
        However, the default is to respond to the "COLORTERM" enviroment
        value.  The "--expanded" option reverses the default.

        Note:  "--expanded" only applies to the "--tokens" option.

1.42    Nov 06, 2025

        Ok, I know it's frustrating, but I completely removed the "expanded"
        option.  Full detection of 256 color and truecolor capability has been
        implemented.

1.43    Nov 06, 2025

        The "tokens" option has a more informative output for all of the
        various color types.  This had the side effect of more available
        tokens.

1.44    Nov 06, 2025

        Internal token handling improved.

        "tokens" option output also improved

1.55    Dec 18, 2025

        Shrank the bin/ansi-encode source a bit my compressing repetitions

1.56    Dec 18, 2025

        Revamped the module to make the source easy to read.

1.57    Dec 22, 2025

        Minor changes.

1.58    Dec 26, 2025

        Optimized -d --dump option.

1.59    Dec 27, 2025

        More memory friendly.

        THIS VERSION WAS REMOVED

1.60    Dec 28, 2025

        Yikes!  1.59 had bugs.  I could swear it worked, but obviously it had issues.
        There were also typos in the manual page.

        Hopefully all of the bugs, typos and other issues are fixed now.

        Note, in the "-t" or "--tokens" option of the "ansi-encode" executable,
        the labeling of the colors are changed.

1.61    Dec 28, 2025

        Changed ANSI color description format in the tokens output of the
        "ansi-encode" script.

        Updated the manual page.
