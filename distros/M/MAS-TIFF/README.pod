MAS::TIFF - Pure Perl TIFF image metadata and samples reading

=head1 DESCRIPTION

MAS stands for Metadata And Samples.

MAS::TIFF is a pure Perl package for reading TIFF image metadata and samples.

The other TIFF reading libraries I could find on CPAN either used C<libtiff>
or were just about metadata. I needed a library that would allow me to read
pixel (sample) data, without needing libtiff.

=head1 STATUS

As of 2012-04-17, some basic metadata reading and reading pixels of bitonal LZW compressed
strips is working, but the API isn't particularly well thought out yet.

The code lives on GitHub: https://github.com/gnp/MAS-TIFF
