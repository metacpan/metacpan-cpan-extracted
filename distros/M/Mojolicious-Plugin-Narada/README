DESCRIPTION

    Mojolicious::Plugin::Narada is a plugin that configure Mojolicious to
    work in Narada project management environment.

    Also this plugin add helpers proxy and weak_proxy, and you MUST use
    them to wrap all callbacks you setup for handling delayed events like
    timers or I/O (both global in your app and related to requests in your
    actions).

    There is also one feature unrelated to Narada - if callback started by
    any action throw unhandled exception it will be sent to browser using
    same $c->reply->exception as it already works for actions without
    delayed response.

    Logging

      Mojolicious default Mojo::Log replaced with MojoX::Log::Fast to
      support logging to project-local syslog daemon in addition to files.
      In most cases it works as drop-in replacement and doesn't require any
      modifications in user code.

      Also it set $app->log->ident() to $c->req->url->path to ease log file
      analyse.

    Configuration

      You should manually add these lines to ./you_app starting script
      before call to Mojolicious::Commands->start_app():

          use Narada::Config qw( get_config_line );
          # mode should be set here because it's used before executing MyApp::startup()
          local $ENV{MOJO_MODE} = get_config_line('mode');

      Config file config/cookie.secret automatically loaded and used to
      initialize $app->secrets() (each line of file became separate param).

      Config file config/basepath automatically loaded and used to fix
      $c->req->url->base->path and $c->req->url->path to guarantee their
      consistency in any environment:

	* url->path doesn't contain base->path

	* url->path does have leading slash

	* url->base->path set to content of config/basepath

      These config files automatically loaded from config/hypnotoad/* and
      used to initialize $app->config(hypnotoad):

          listen
          proxy
          accepts
          workers

      Also hypnotoad configured to keep it lock/pid files in var/.

    Locking

      unlock() will be automatically called after all actions and
      callbacks, even if they throw unhandled exception.
