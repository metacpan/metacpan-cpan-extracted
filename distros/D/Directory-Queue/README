Directory-Queue

The goal of this module is to offer a queue system using the underlying
filesystem for storage, security and to prevent race conditions via atomic
operations. It focuses on simplicity, robustness and scalability.

This module allows multiple concurrent readers and writers to interact with
the same queue. A Python implementation of the same algorithm is available
at https://github.com/cern-mig/python-dirq and a Java implementation at
https://github.com/cern-mig/java-dirq so readers and writers can be
written in different programming languages.
