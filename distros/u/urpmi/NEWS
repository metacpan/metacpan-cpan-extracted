    (regression introduced in 6.18)
  o add aria2 to the priority list of packages that need to be updated
    before restarting urpmi
  o fix issue with urpmi sometimes using the wrong key when checking 
    signatures when the same package is available from different media
  o remove packages from installed-through-deps.list when they are explicitly
    requested using urpmi (even if they were already installed) (#45054)

Version 6.19 - 24 November 2008

- urpmi
  o in --auto, do display an error message when rpms are missing

    (you can use -a to force it)
  o revert --auto-update behaviour in case of media update failures (#45417)
  o ensure download when updating media (with --auto-update) is quiet
- urpmi.update
  o updated "ignore"d medium should not become non "ignore"d (#45457)

  o prompt for "retry" on aria2 download failure
  o retry once on aria2 versioned-file download failure
  o allow setting aria2-options in urpmi.cfg
- urpmi
  o fix "urpmi firefox mozilla-firefox-ext-google-toolbar ; 
    urpme --auto-orphans mozilla-firefox-ext-google-toolbar" which must not
    remove firefox (cf #45058)
    (this is especially bad for DrakX/rpmsrate)
  o fix --auto-update ignoring --media and default-media (#45097)
- gurpmi
  o display the download errors
  o log all urpmi logs
  o fix answering yes to questions on error

  o do not allow "/" in media name (#44765)
- urpmi.update, urpmi.addmedia
  o exit on failing media instead of ignoring them
    (esp. for urpmi.addmedia --distrib).
    exceptions: "urpmi.update -a" and "urpmi.update --update" 
                for backward compatibility

Version 6.17 - 14 October 2008

- urpmi
  o diskspace issues are now a fatal error (need perl-URPM 3.20)
    (no use going on with the other transactions)
- gurpmi
  o add support for --clean
- urpmi.update, urpmi.addmedia, urpmi.removemedia:
  o do not check wether the media are valid, 
    it allows "mv /etc/urpmi/urpmi.cfg.{backup,} ; urpmi.update -a" to work
    (nb: not equivalent with urpmi.addmedia, since pubkey will not be imported)
- aria2:
  o do not use --max-file-not-found=3 when downloading rpms 
    (since rpms are "versioned")
  o use it even if nearest mirror is rsync
- library:

  o handle --replacefiles (will be used by mdkonline)
    (require perl-URPM 3.19)
- gurpmi:
  o do not exit in --auto mode at end of installation which prevents
    restarting after priority upgrade
  o fix using --rpm-root & --urpmi-root
  o just do not ask for confirmation before removing packages in
     --auto mode,

Version 6.14 - 23 September 2008

- use "versioned" media_info files
  (needed for aria2 to handle mirrors not having some media_info/*)
- urpmi.addmedia, urpmi.update:
  o for remote media, instead of first checking reconfig.urpmi, try MD5SUM. 
    If it fails try reconfig.urpmi
  o only look for "descriptions" in media_info/
  o do not get "descriptions" on non update media since it's useless and
    potentially slow
- urpmi.addmedia:
  o --distrib: do not skip "debug_for=" media
    (debug media will be added with flag "ignore" if noauto=1)
  o for remote media, do not probe for media_info files in "./", do it only in
    "media_info/"
- aria2:
  o use --ftp-pasv (as suggested by aria2 developer)
  o use --connect-timeout 6 seconds (instead of 3)

  o fix orphans handling: an already installed pkg must not become
    "unrequested" because a new version of it is required
- fix display of downloaded urls with aria2 and metalinks

- call aria2 with brand-new --uri-selector=adaptive

Version 6.5 - 1 September 2008, Pascal "Pixel" Rigaux

- all tools
  o use metalink/aria2 by default (when available) when using a mirrorlist
- urpmi, urpmq
  o do not display all substring matches on stderr, only a subset of them, and
    suggest to use "-a" to use all matches (#38956)
- urpmi
  o do not write useless "foo (obsoletes foo-xxx)" in
    installed-through-deps.list (#42167)
- urpmi.addmedia
  o instead of discarding --update when using --distrib, give it a meaning:
    only add media flagged "update"
  o handle $URPMI_ADDMEDIA_REASON 
    (special reason to give to api.mandriva.com/mirrors/... to allow statistics)
- gurpmi2
  o nicer default window size

- all tools:
  o handle "unrequested orphans" (similar to "deborphan")
  o statedir files are now in /var/lib/urpmi/<medium-name>/
      for eg: /var/lib/urpmi/synthesis.hdlist.<medium-name> is now
      /var/lib/urpmi/<medium-name>/synthesis.hdlist.cz

- urpmi.addmedia, urpmi.update:
  o fix checking synthesis MD5SUM

Version 5.19 - 3 April 2008, by Pascal "Pixel" Rigaux

- urpmq:
  o --suggests is currently misleading, introduce --allow-suggests and explain

  o check usage of -a, -! and the like instead of displaying the ugly
    "Internal error: syntax error ..."
  o in some cases (iso on disk), the hdlist is not available in
    media/xxx/media_info/, but we can use the statedir copy. So use it

  o exit immediately on success in automatic mode
  o fix --auto-select option
  o fix --root option
  o give the focus to buttons (Emmanuel Blindauer, #38047)

- urpmf:
  o fix mirrorlist handling
  o fix fallback on hdlist when xml-info not found

  o have fatal errors on some errors that must not happen (eg: moving rpm from
    download dir to cachedir)
  o handle variables $ARCH/$RELEASE in mirrorlist
- urpmi:
  o display "%s of packages will be retrieved."
    (need perl-URPM 3.10 and synthesis built with @filesize@)

  o --test: only display "Installation is possible" when it is the case (#29837)
  o fix "using one big transaction" that occurs when using --keep

- bash-completion:
  o restore available-pkgs completion using "urpmq --list" (guillomovitch)
    (but only if COMP_URPMI_HDLISTS is set since it's slow)

- all tools:
  o handle mirrorlist 
    (need perl-Zone-TimeInfo patched for geolocalisation)
- urpmf

  o do not parse synthesis (relying on MD5SUM for corruption detection)
  o drop /var/lib/urpmi/names.<medium> (was used by bash-completion)
- urpmi.addmedia
  o don't fail on remaining statedir files (#36267)

Version 5.4 - 5 February 2008, by Pascal "Pixel" Rigaux

- bug fix release
- urpmi, urpme, urpmq, urpmf:
  o fix --use-distrib

- urpmq:
  o add --no-suggests
- library:
  o since any_xml_info can be slow, add a "callback" option (#37264)

Version 5.2 - 18 January 2008, by Pascal "Pixel" Rigaux

- urpmi:
  o --buildrequires deprecate --src, --src is kept for compatibility but its
    behaviour is changed a little (it doesn't download src.rpm anymore)
  o --install-src as user now works for remote medium
  o --install-src will remove succesfully installed src.rpm from
    /var/cache/urpmi/rpms/* (unless post-clean is 0)
- urpmf:
  o add special code for --files simple case, it makes urpmf 3x faster for
    this often used case
  o display a warning when searching "xxx(yyy)" since it is handled as a
    regexp and so the parentheses are useless. suggest using --literal
- urpmq:
  o add --provides

- all tools:
  o deprecate --curl and --wget in favor of --downloader curl

- urpmf, urpmq:
  o use xml info instead of hdlist when possible
    o "urpmq -l" is faster (3x)
    o "urpmf -l" is slower (1.5x)
    o "urpmf --sourcerpm" is much faster
    o see "xml-info" option in urpmi.cfg(5) to see when those files are downloaded
    o new require: perl module XML::LibXML
- urpmq:
  o use rpm file instead of hdlist/xml-info when file is local
  o use URPM::Package->changelogs (need perl-URPM 3.06)
- urpmf
  o fix an *old* bug (since december 2002) making urpmf keeps parsed
    hdlist files in memory (was fixed for multitags, but not for simple tags)
- all tools:
  o replace /var/lib/urpmi/MD5SUM with /var/lib/urpmi/MD5SUM.<medium_name>
    (this will allow checking xml media_info is up-to-date even if we don't
    update it at the same time as synthesis is updated)
- urpmi.update, urpmi.addmedia, urpmi.removemedia:
  o drop hdlist support replaced with xml media_info
    (this imply file-deps are correctly handled, see genhdlist2(1))
  o drop option "-c" which used to clean /var/cache/urpmi/headers
  o enhancement: only parse updated synthesis
- urpmi.addmedia
  o do check md5sum of downloaded synthesis
    (the check was only done on urpmi.update)
  o new --xml-info option
- urpmi:
  o do remove __db* on priority-upgrade
    (fix regression introduced in 4.10.15)
  o always prompt before doing a priority-upgrade transaction, even if there
    is only one priority upgrade package (since there will be more packages to
    install after restarting urpmi)

Version 4.10.19 - 12 December 2007, by Pascal "Pixel" Rigaux

- urpmi:
  o fix handling "post-clean: 0" in urpmi.cfg 
    (#36082, regression introduced in 4.10.16)
- library:
  o urpm::media::read_config() doesn't read urpmi.cfg global options anymore,
    use urpm->get_global_options or urpm->new_parse_cmdline

Version 4.10.18 - 11 December 2007, by Pascal "Pixel" Rigaux

- urpmi:
  o handle --suggests (to override urpmi.cfg global option "no-suggests")

  o leave early with error if no medium were successfull updated
- drop translated man pages (they are too old)
- urpmi.addmedia:
  o exit code 1 when a medium can't be added
  o enhance parsing of urls with login:password for logins with "@"
    so that password doesn't end up in urpmi.cfg
  o adapt to perl-URPM 3.00 API to parse pubkey files
    (nb: $urpm->{keys} is not used anymore)

Version 4.10.17 - 30 November 2007, by Pascal "Pixel" Rigaux

- urpmi:
  o fix regression introduced in 4.10.15:
    "urpmi --force valid invalid" should warn about "invalid" but still
    install "valid"

Version 4.10.16 - 28 November 2007, by Pascal "Pixel" Rigaux

- urpmi:
  o small transactions should have at least 8 packages 
    (ie --split-length is now 8 by default)
  o do not do a big transaction if installing less than 20 packages
    (ie --split-level is now 1 by default)
- urpmq:
  o new option --requires-recursive (alias of option -d)
  o bugfix previous release: "urpmq --fuzzy foo" should display all "*foo*" matches

Version 4.10.15 - 26 November 2007, by Pascal "Pixel" Rigaux

- all tools:
  o exit with code 1 after displaying usage (instead of exit code 0)
- urpmi:
  o with rsync, use --copy-links (to have the same behaviour as http/ftp, and
    so allow symlinks on the server)
  o fix "urpmi --install-src" (regression introduced in 4.10.9) (#35164)
  o fix --limit-rate (regression introduced in 4.9.12)

    pubkey_main_updates is missing)

Version 4.9.23 - 3 May 2007, by Pascal "Pixel" Rigaux

- urpmi
  o always upgrade (-U) packages instead of installing (-i) them,

- urpmi
  o fix encoding issue with "--bug ..." introduced in previous version (#28387)

    (#28367)
- urpmq
  o rename option -R into --whatrequires
  o rename option -RR into --whatrequires-recursive,

    so that someone can easily use them by removing ignore
    (nb: debug_for and srpm media are not added though)
    (cf bug #28050)

Version 4.9.11 - 12 December 2006, by Pascal "Pixel" Rigaux

- urpmi
  o when "urpmi --auto-select" needs to restart urpmi because of a
    priority-upgrade, ensure it doesn't prompt an unneeded choice before
    restarting (#27527)
    (nb: the problem can still occur on "urpmi rpmdrake")

Version 4.9.4 - 24 November 2006, by Pascal "Pixel" Rigaux

- urpmi.addmedia:
  o fix random ordering of media (using --distrib on a non-remote medium)
  o now inserting non-remote medium after first non-remote medium
    (instead of adding it as first medium)
- urpmi, urpme, urpmq:

- fix handling multiple virtual hdlist files
  (the second pass was not done...)

Version 4.9.2 - 24 November 2006, by Pascal "Pixel" Rigaux

- bug fix release:
- /foo/@86875:bar.src.rpm is not a url with protocol /foo/@86875
- /foo/chroot_tmp/... is not a url with protocol /foo/chroot

Version 4.9.1 - 23 November 2006, by Pascal "Pixel" Rigaux

- cleanup locks handling, log locking, and don't say "urpmi database locked"
  when it's the rpm database that is locked
- urpmi:
  o add --nokeep (which overrides urpmi.cfg global option "keep")

Version 4.9.0 - 22 November 2006, by Pascal "Pixel" Rigaux

- urpmi:
  o don't fork on multiple transactions
  o fix buggy print "::logger_id::" (#27026)
- gurpmi2 (tvignaud): 
  o fix unvisible content
  o prevent a dialog to have a height of several scores of thousands pixels
  o add support of --root
- urpmi.update:
  o don't write urpmi.cfg unless really needed
  o don't write md5sum in urpmi.cfg (bugfix)
- urpmi.addmedia:
  o drop support for "list" file
    (now you must have a hdlist/synthesis on remote server)
  o drop support for searching recursively rpms when there is no
    hdlist/synthesis. Only search in given directory (ie $url/*.rpm)
  o do not use list.<media_name> to store passwords, use /etc/urpmi/netrc
    instead. Also do have the url in urpmi.cfg, only the password is removed
  o change the format of list.<media_name>, it contains only rpm files
    relative to the medium url
  o deprecate "... with <relative hdlist/synthesis>". It is not useful anymore
    (nb: if you want to force using hdlist or synthesis, use --probe-hdlist or
    --probe-synthesis)
  o don't write urpmi.cfg twice
  o do not look for hdlist/synthesis in ../media_info/hdlist$suffix.cz (nb:
    with media.cfg, it will still use hdlist from media/media_info/, but it
    will simply use the hdlist$suffix.cz given by media.cfg )
  o --norebuild is by default (and deprecated): when the local
    hdlist/synthesis is buggy, do not discard it and go searching for *.rpm.
    Make it an error instead
  o fix building synthesis when using *.rpm (ie no hdlist/synthesis)
- urpmi.removemedia: much faster (since it doesn't parse hdlist/synthesis anymore)
- handle "empty" hdlist/synthesis
- generate names.<media_name> only when the medium is created/updated
- major splitting of urpm.pm in many modules
- major splitting of functions in smaller functions
  (eg: update_media was 988 lines long, has been splitted in functions shorter
  than 105 lines)
- big code cleanup/rework
- perl_checker compliance (very useful for such big code rework)
