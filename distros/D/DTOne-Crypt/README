NAME

    DTOne::Crypt - Cryptographic Toolkit

SYNOPSIS

      use DTOne::Crypt qw(encrypt_aes256gcm decrypt_aes256gcm);
    
      my $encrypted = encrypt_aes256gcm($plaintext, $master_key);
      my $decrypted = decrypt_aes256gcm($encrypted, $master_key);

DESCRIPTION

    DTOne::Crypt provides a cryptographic toolkit intended to abstract
    complexities in data interchange.

FUNCTIONS

    DTone::Crypt implements the following functions, which can be imported
    individually:

 encrypt_aes256gcm

      my $encrypted = encrypt_aes256gcm($plaintext, $master_key);

    Encrypt plaintext value using AES-256 GCM to a base64 encoded string
    containing the salt, initialization vector (IV), ciphertext, and tag.

 decrypt_aes256gcm

      my $decrypted = decrypt_aes256gcm($encrypted, $master_key);

    Decrypt a composite base64 encoded string containing the salt, IV,
    ciphertext, and tag back to its original plaintext value.

CAVEATS

 Key Length

    Master key is expected to be exactly 256 bits in length, encoded in
    base64.

 Performance

    Random byte generation on Linux might run slow over time unless
    haveged(8) is running. In this scenario, the streaming facility of
    aes-gcm will be more memory efficient.
