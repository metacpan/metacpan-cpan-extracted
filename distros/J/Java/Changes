Revision history for Perl extension Java.

1.0  Fri Apr 28 16:36:29 2000
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.20 with options
		-X -n Java -v 1.0
1.1  
	 - Allow creation of primitive Java array types
	 - Allow Strings to be created using encodings for Localization
		w/':string_<ENCODING>' syntax
	 - Allow integers to be strings w/':string' syntax
1.12
	- Refined string encoding stuff
1.13
	- Added 'static_call' function to make static method calls on
		classes NOT in packages.
1.14
	- Just setsockopt SO_REUSEADDR on Java.pm event_server port
2.0
	8/23/00
	- Now using ctrl-A to separate parameter lists so we can accept
		commas or any other printable character in strings.
		THIS CHANGE MEANS NEITHER JAVASERVER NOR JAVA.PM ARE
			COMPATIBLE WITH ANY 1.X RELEASE!!
		(hence the bump up of the major version number!)

Java stuff got updated to 2.1 - Perl stuff still at 2.0
        1/24/01
        - Included Andreas Leue's code to statically start and stop
                JavaServer from within an already-running Java app
                Check out 'test_test.pl' in the Perl examples directory
                so see what this looks like on the Perl side.  Pretty
                much the same!
                On the Java side you can now use 'JavaServer.start()',
                or 'JavaServer.start(int port)' to specify a port other
                than 2000 to programmatically start JavaServer & you
                similarly use 'JavaServer.stop()' to stop the madness
                when you've had enough fun.
                Like:

                public class MyApp
                {
                        public static void main(String args[])
                        {
                                // Allow JavaServer to 'hook' into
                                //      your running program
                                JavaServer.start();


                                // Do whatever yer program does

                                // Done
                                JavaServer.stop();
                        }
                }
        - Fixed stupid bug about the MANIFEST file looking for Java.jar
                when it's really called JavaServer.jar

Perl stuff up to 2.1 - Java stuff the same
	2/22/01
	- Fixed bug in 'static_call' so it now uses PARAMETER_SEPARATOR
		(thanks to David Roth)
	- Fixed bugs in java_server_install.pl to correctly reference 
		'JavaServer.jar' & not 'Java.jar'
		(thanks to Slavan Rezic & David Roth)
Perl stuff up to 2.2 - Java stuff the same
	3/9/01
	- Overloaded '==' to be the same as the 'same' function.
		So instead of having to do:
			if ($obj1.same($obj2))
		You can now do:
			if ($obj1 == $obj2)
		Check out the perldoc.
	- Added JavaArray tied interface for Java arrays!
		See 'perldoc Java' for all the glorious details!
		It's very cool!  See 'array.pl' in 'examples' directory
		for example usage.
	- Some other random bug fixes for the install stuff

Both Perl & Java stuff moved up to 3.0
	3/21/01
	- Moved up major version numbers because the JavaServer protocol
		has changed & is incompatible with previous versions.
		It was changed to handle multi-line sending.  Now all commands
		sent & received must be terminated by a Control-A beginning
		a line by itself (akin to SMTP and the '.' to end DATA).
	- So now you can say something like:
		my $str = $java->create_object("java.lang.String","multi\nline\string);
		As well as correctly fetch the value using 'get_value'.
	- Should ONLY effect multi-line String processing BUT since the
		protocol itself has changed yer gonna need 3.x versions so
		they can understand each other.
Perl stuff up to 3.1 Java stuff the same
	5/16/01
	- AUTOLOAD function now correctly recognizes if it's dealing with
		a static or instantiated method call - THEREFORE you can now
		call instantiated functions with '_'s in their names.
	- Also threw in some reorg of how functions get called to isolate
		the code.
....	- License change for Perl code to Perl's Artistic License (was GPL)
....	- License change for Java code to LGPL 2.1 (was GPL)

6/29/01 Perl 3.2 Java 3.1
	- Now can handle 'null' values for parameter lists & return values
		-Perl stuff use 'undef' to pass in a null value
			null values will be returned as 0 (zero)
			So you say: $object->function($param1,undef,$parm3);
				to pass null as the 2nd parameter
			Or: $array->[4] = undef;
			perldoc Java.pm for more info
		-Java stuff - a protocol addition of NULL_TOKEN
			To pass a 'null' to JavaServer use NULL_TOKEN as 
			defined in Dealer.java (curently '___NULL___') & 'NUL'
			value now correctly returned for null values
			(same thing as functions that return void)

7/10/01 
Perl & Java both to 4.0
Date: 994752000
4.0	Authorization additions - now a shared secret between server &
		client can exist to allow the server to authorize
		remote clients.  Hopefully this will open the door to
		further security enhancements.
	Event port usage can now be turned off by specifying an event_port
		of '-1'
	Callback objects can be created & used to allow Java to call Perl 
		See the Java2Perl.java classfile and the java2perl directory
		under 'examples' & Java.pm's perldoc
	Thanks to Achim Settelmeier for the Auth & Callback Stuff! Good Job!
	Added support for getting the last Exception object & a convenience
		method for dumping its stack trace into a perl array via
		the 'get_exception' and 'get_stack_trace' methods.  See the
		perldoc.  Before all you could get was just the String-ified
		message ('getMessage()') of the Exception.

    instantiated object.  added some convenience functions for this too

    Put eval'ed callbacks in package main by default like it should have been
    in the first place
