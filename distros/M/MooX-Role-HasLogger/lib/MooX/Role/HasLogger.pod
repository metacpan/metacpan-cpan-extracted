=head1 NAME

MooX::Role::HasLogger - Moo role that provides a logger attribute

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  package Foo;

  use Moo;
  use MooX::TypeTiny;
  use namespace::clean;

  with qw( MooX::Role::HasLogger );

  sub bar {
    my ( $self ) = @_;
    $self->logger->info( 'log something' );
  }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This L<Moo::Role> based role provides a C<logger> attribute to the consuming
class.  The attribute is read-only and its value is grabbed lazily. The type
library L<MooX::Role::HasLogger::Types> exports the C<Logger> type that defines
the interface of the attribute. The C<build_logger()> builder method returns a
L<Log::Any> logger object with the consuming class as its category.

=head1 EXAMPLE

This extended example

  package Bar;

  use Moo;
  use MooX::TypeTiny;
  use Types::Standard              qw( HasMethods );
  use MooX::Role::HasLogger::Types qw( Logger );
  use namespace::clean;

  with qw( MooX::Role::HasLogger );

  has '+logger' => ( isa => ( Logger ) & ( HasMethods [ qw( tracef debugf infof warnf errorf fatalf ) ] ) );

  sub build_logger {
    return Log::Any->get_logger( category => ref shift, default_adapter => 'Stderr' );
  }

how to extend the C<Logger> type using a L<Type::Tiny> intersection. Now a
logger has to be an object of a class that implements the C<Logger> type
methods and additionally the C<f> suffixed log methods.

=item *

how to override the C<build_logger()> builder method. This time the builder
returns a L<Log::Any> logger object with the consuming class as its category
and with a default adapter that refers to the L<Log::Any::Adapter::Stderr>
adapter class.
