      * $hook - the hook to execute

      * $data - data to pass to the sub

    It returns undef

 applicant_list

    Retrieves a list of all known applicants.

    Returns a Ryu::Source which will emit one
    WebService::Async::Onfido::Applicant for each applicant found.

 paging

    Supports paging through HTTP GET requests.

      * $starting_uri - the initial URI to request

      * $factory - a sub that we will call with a Ryu::Source and expect to
      return a second response-processing sub.

    Returns a Ryu::Source.

 extract_links

    Given a set of strings representing the Link headers in an HTTP
    response, extracts the URIs based on the rel attribute as described in
    RFC5988 <http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5988>.

    Returns a list of key, value pairs where the key contains the lowercase
    rel value and the value is a URI instance.

     my %links = $self->extract_links($res->header('Link'))
     print "Last page would be $links{last}"

 applicant_create

 applicant_check

    Perform an identity check on an applicant.

      details for this check, and it will not count towards the quota for
      this service account

      * consider - used for sandbox API testing only
