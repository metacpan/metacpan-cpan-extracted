        # Change this line if you use local::lib or need
        # specific libraries loaded for your application
        use lib '/home/robin/perl5/lib/perl5';

        use Plack::App::Apache::ActionWrapper;
        my $app = Plack::App::Apache::ActionWrapper->new->enable_debug->to_app;

        # Run the actual app
        use Plack::Handler::FCGI;
        Plack::Handler::FCGI->new->run($app);

        1;

        ------------- index.psgi -----------------

            return [
                200,
                [ 'Content-Type' => 'text/plain' ],
                [
                    "This is the index.\n",
                    'PATH_INFO=' . $env->{'PATH_INFO'} . "\n",
                    'PATH_TRANSLATED=' . $env->{'PATH_TRANSLATED'} . "\n",
                ],
            ];
        };

DESCRIPTION
    The PSGI web application specification is awesome. Plack is awesome as
    well. Running PSGI apps using plackup in development is super easy.

    But what do you do when you want to deploy your PSGI app on shared
    hosting? You can deploy it using traditional CGI, but if you're dealing
    with something like Moose or Catalyst-based apps it's bound to be slow.

    So your shared hosting provider has provided you with FastCGI support to
    mitigate that problem. But because FastCGIExternalServer cannot be
    defined in .htaccess you can only run dynamic FastCGI applications.

    Your immediate reaction is to define "AddHandler fcgid-script .psgi" in
    your .htaccess and use plackup on the shebang line to run your PSGI app.
    But that doesn't work if you use local::lib, because @INC is not setup
    properly.

    By using a wrapper as specified in the synopsis you can avoid having to
    type in "use lib 'XXX'" in every one of your .psgi files. Another
    benefit is that you can preload modules to benefit from copy-on-write on
    operating systems that provide it to diminish the memory usage.

METHODS
  call
    The main handler that will be returned by the "to_app" method inherited
    from Plack::Component.

  enable_debug
    Mutator to enable debug output if no path was found in PATH_TRANSLATED.
    Allows chaining.

  disable_debug
    Mutator to disable debug output if no path was found in PATH_TRANSLATED.
    Allows chaining.

  is_debug_enabled
    Accessor to determine if debug is enabled or not. Debug is disabled by
    default.
