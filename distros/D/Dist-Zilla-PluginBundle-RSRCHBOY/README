NAME

    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::RSRCHBOY - Zilla your distributions like
    RSRCHBOY!

VERSION

    This document describes version 0.077 of
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::RSRCHBOY - released March 05, 2018 as part
    of Dist-Zilla-PluginBundle-RSRCHBOY.

SYNOPSIS

        # in your dist.ini...
        [@RSRCHBOY]

DESCRIPTION

    This is RSRCHBOY's current Dist::Zilla dist.ini config for his
    packages. He's still figuring this all out. It's like vim, you never
    really know all the things.

    If you'd like to see what this does without digging into the guts, I
    recommend you install the most excellent
    Dist::Zilla::App::Command::dumpphases package. This will give you a new
    dzil command, allowing you to see a sensible dump of what plugins are
    going to be used, etc.

METHODS

 release_plugins

    Plugin configuration for public release.

 author_tests

 meta_provider_plugins

    Plugins that mess about with what goes into META.*.

 configure

    Preps plugin lists / config; see Dist::Zilla::Role::PluginBundle::Easy.

 stopwords

    A list of words our POD spell checker should ignore.

OPTIONS

 sign (boolean; default: true)

    On release, use your gpg key to sign the version tag created (if you're
    using git) and also generate a SIGNATURE file.

    See also Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Signature.

 tweet (boolean; default: true)

    If set to a true value, we'll use Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Twitter to tweet
    when a release occurs.

 github (boolean; default: true)

    This enables various GitHub related plugins to update distribution and
    GitHub metadata automatically.

 install_on_release (boolean; default: true)

    After a release, install the distribution locally. Our default install
    command is (from inside the built release directory):

        cpanm .

    You can change this by setting the InstallRelease.install_command
    option.

BUNDLED PLUGIN OPTIONS

    It's possible to pass options to our bundled plugins directly:

        ; format is Plugin::Name.option
        [@RSRCHBOY]
        GatherDir.exclude_filename = cpanfile

    For information on specific plugins and their options, you should refer
    to the documentation of
    Dist::Zilla::Role::PluginBundle::Config::Slicer.
