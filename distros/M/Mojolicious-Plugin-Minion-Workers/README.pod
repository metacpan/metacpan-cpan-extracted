=head1 DESCRIPTION

L<Mojolicious::Plugin::Minion::Workers> is a L<Mojolicious> plugin for the L<Minion> job
queue and has extending base L<Mojolicious::Plugin::Minion> for enable workers managment.

=head1 Extend base plugin config

L<Mojolicious::Plugin::Minion::Workers> apply all config options of the base plugin L<Mojolicious::Plugin::Minion>,
and define following

=head2 workers(integer)

Amount of Minion workers need to start/restart. This value can be overriden on C< $app->minion->workers->manage(...) >.

=head2 tasks(hashref)

You can define Minion tasks in config.

  ..., tasks => { foo_task => sub { ... }, },

=head1 Manage workers

L<Mojolicious::Plugin::Minion::Workers> add attr B<workers> to the C<< $app->minion >> object.
C<< $app->minion->workers >> object has following new one public method.

=head2 manage(integer amount)

Start/restart Minion passed amount workers or get its from plugin config.
None workers mean skip managment.

  $app->minion->workers->manage(2);

Tested on standard commands (on Linux):

  $ perl script/app.pl daemon       # one minion worker will be starting
  $ perl script/app.pl prefork        # your amount minion workers will be starting
  $ morbo script/app.pl                 # when morbo restarts on watch changes one minion worker will be restarting too
  $ hypnotoad script/app.pl           # your amount minion workers will be starting
  $ hypnotoad script/app.pl           # on hot deploy minion workers will be restarting too
  $ hypnotoad -s script/app.pl        # minion workers will stoping too

B<NOTE>. For commands C<$ morbo script/app.pl> and C<$ perl script/app.pl daemon>
amount workers always one process.

B<NOTE>. In case hypnotoad and C<$ kill -USR2 app_pid> minion workers will not restarts, sorry.
Always use hot deploy command C<$ hypnotoad script/app.pl>.

B<BIG NOTE>. When minion workers restarts (hypnotoad | morbo) then B<ALL> exists minion processes stoped.
So if you run many separate apps with one database backend then dont use this module.
Or set separate backend databases as well.
