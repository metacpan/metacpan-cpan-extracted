Subject: Non-Standard Formatted CPAN Uploads

Dear CPAN Author,

It has been noted that one or more uploads recently were incorrectly
formatted, such that the tools to provide automated CPAN Testing, and
the reporting mechanisms for the CPAN Testers and CPAN Statistics sites
are unable to record your uploads.

The upload messages in question are:

[% uploads -%]

[% IF others -%]Other failed uploads:
[% others ; END -%]

The number at the beginning of the line is the NNTP ID of the message as 
recorded by the CPAN testers NNTP server, and can be seen by searching 
list archives replace the <NNTP ID> in the following URL with the 
appropriate number:

http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.cpan.uploads/<NNTP ID>

In order to be correctly recorded, please note your upload needs to be 
of the format:

<distribution name>-<distribution version>.<archive extension>

For example something like

Acme-Example-0.01.tar.gz

With the accepted archive extensions being:

* .tar.gz
* .tar.bz2
* .tgz
* .zip

While there is nothing stopping you creating your own format to upload 
distributions, please note that only distributions uploaded in the above 
formats will be recorded and tested within the CPAN testers system. 

The best way to generate a correctly formatted tarball, ready for 
upload, is to use one of the methods described below:


1) Using your Makefile.PL

$> perl Makefile.PL
$> make dist

If you are on a Win32 platform, 'nmake dist' is compatible.


2) Using your Build.PL

$> perl Build.PL
$> ./Build dist

For further options see Module::Build documentation.


If you have since corrected this upload with a correctly formatted one, 
please ignore this mail. This mail is automatically generated based on 
recent upload messages, and only notes the uploads which have not been 
parsed correctly for the CPAN Statistics site.

If you have any questions about the CPAN testers mechanisms, please 
don't hesitate to ask. For more information about CPAN Testers, please 
see the CPAN Testers Wiki - http://wiki.cpantesters.org - or join the 
CPAN Testers Discuss mailing list by sending a blank email to 
cpan-testers-discuss-subscribe@perl.org.

Thanks for contributing to CPAN and Perl.

Regards,
Barbie.
