NAME

Parse::Perl - interpret string as Perl source

DESCRIPTION

This module provides the capability to parse a string at runtime as Perl
source code, so that the resulting compiled code can be later executed.
This is part of the job of the string form of the "eval" operator,
but in this module it is separated out from the other jobs of "eval".
Parsing of Perl code is generally influenced by its lexical context,
and this module provides some explicit control over this process, by
reifying lexical environments as Perl objects.

Perl's built-in "eval" operator (in string form) actually performs four
distinct jobs: capture lexical environment, parse Perl source, execute
code, and catch exceptions.  This module allows each of these four jobs
to be performed separately, so they can then be combined in ways that
"eval" doesn't permit.  Capturing lexical environment is performed
using a special operator supplied by this module.  Parsing Perl source
is performed by a function supplied by this module.  Executing code is
adequately handled by Perl's native mechanisms for calling functions
through references.  Finally, exception catching is handled by the block
form of "eval".
