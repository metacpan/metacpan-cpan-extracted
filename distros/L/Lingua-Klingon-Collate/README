Lingua::Klingon::Collate version 1.03
=====================================

Lingua::Klingon::Collate is a module which allows you to sort words in
Klingon sort order (for example, 'ngan' should sort after 'nob' since
'ng' comes after 'n' in Klingon sort order and counts as one letter).

You can either transform all words into a representation that allows you
to use the normal sort command, or use a subroutine that will transform
a word "on the fly".

Generally, if you are sorting many words, it will be quicker to
transform each word individually and sort the transformed words. You can
either keep a record of which original word matches which transformed
word, or untransform the words after sorting.

This module is based on the C library functions strxfrm(3) and
strcoll(3). There is no standard C library function strunxfrm(3).

CHANGES SINCE THE LAST VERSION

Update code to support multi-word strings, and added tests for that.
