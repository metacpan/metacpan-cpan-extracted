<tmpl_var distro>

The README is used to introduce the module and provide instructions on
how to install the module, any machine dependencies it may have (for
example C compilers and installed libraries) and any other information
that should be provided before the module is installed.

A README file is required for CPAN modules since CPAN extracts the README
file from a module distribution so that people browsing the archive
can use it get an idea of the modules uses. It is usually a good idea
to provide version information here so that people can decide whether
fixes for the module are worth downloading.
