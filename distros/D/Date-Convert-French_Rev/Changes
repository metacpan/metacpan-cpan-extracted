0.08  Tridi 23 Thermidor CCXXIII, jour de la lentille (Monday 2015-08-10,
      which, according to the Gregorian calendar, is the 223rd anniversary
      of the storming of the Tuileries palace)
        - fix prerequisite: Date::Convert 0.16 is fine, 0.14 is not.
          Actually, RT ticket 90470 was prematurely and erroneously declared
          as "fixed".
        - improve the documentation of method "change_to".
        - add more tests

0.07  Décadi 10 Thermidor CCXXIII, jour de l'arrosoir (Tuesday 2015-07-28, also
      the 221st anniversary of Robespierre's death)
        - fix prerequisite: Date::Convert 0.16 is fine, 0.14 is not (RT ticket 90470)
        - test file to check the parameter checks (mistakenly not included in 0.06)
        - a few documentation fixes
        - fix the mojibake bug (similar to RT ticket 100311 for DT::C::FR)
        - add an alternate API to convert from French Revolutionary to other calendar

0.06  Octidi 18 Brumaire CCXXII, jour de la dentelaire (Friday 2013-11-08, also
      the 214th anniversary of Bonaparte's coup agains the Directorate)
        - kwalitee issues: license, style, META.{yml,json}
        - use UTF-8 instead of ISO-8859-1, use spaces instead of tabs
        - more tests, more modern tests

0.05  Nonidi 9 Floréal CCXI, jour de la jacinthe (Monday 2003-04-28)
        - last version compatible with Date::Convert, next one will
        be in the DateTime::Calendar namespace, compatible with DateTime.pm
        - I had always believed that the additional days were not called
        Primidi, Duodi etc. But I have found a document where they are
        called Primidi etc. The bug in the module is fixed.

0.04  Tridi 13 Fructidor CCX, jour de l'épine-vinette (Friday 2002-08-30)
	- reorganise the directory structure along Matt Sergeant's tips
        - include the 4000-modulus rule for leap years (according to emacs-21.2)
        - reorganise the absolute -> FR conversion
	- rephrase the README file
	- add the  prerequisite for Date::Convert  in Makefile.PL (the
	use statement and the @ISA array are not sufficient)
        - add a few examples in the eg/ subdirectory
	- fix a few bugs: $_ was squashed by date_string, the month value
	was not checked
	- compatibility with diagnostics-1.2

0.03  Décadi 20 Thermidor CCIX, jour de l'écluse (Tuesday 2001-08-07)
        - rewrite the Changes file, with proper dates
        - it seems that the 4th additional day should rather be "jour
	de l'opinion"
	- reformat the code

0.02  Nonidi 19 Prairial CCIX, jour du tilleul (Thursday 2001-06-07)
        - add the prerequisite for Roman.pm in Makefile.PL
