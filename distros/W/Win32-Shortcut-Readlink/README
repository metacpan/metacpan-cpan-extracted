NAME

    Win32::Shortcut::Readlink - Make readlink work with shortcuts

VERSION

    version 0.02

SYNOPSIS

     use Win32::Shortcut::Readlink;
     
     my $target = readlink "c:\\users\\foo\\Desktop\\Application.lnk";

DESCRIPTION

    This module overloads the perl built-in function readlink so that it
    will treat shortcuts like pseudo symlinks on cygwin and MSWin32. This
    module doesn't do anything on any other platform, so you are free to
    make this a dependency, even if your module or script is going to run
    on non-Windows platforms.

    This module adjusts the behavior of readlink ONLY in the calling
    module, so you shouldn't have to worry about breaking other modules
    that depend on the more traditional behavior.

FUNCTION

 readlink

     my $target = readlink EXPR
     my $target = readlink

    Returns the value of a symbolic link or the target of the shortcut on
    Windows, if either symbolic links are implemented or if shortcuts are.
    If not, raises an exception. If there is a system error, returns the
    undefined value and sets $! (errno). If EXPR is omitted, uses $_.

CAVEATS

    Does not handle Unicode. Patches welcome.

    Before Perl 5.16, CORE functions could not be aliased, and you will see
    warnings on Perl 5.14 and earlier if you pass undef in as the argument
    to readlink, even if you have warnings turned off. The work around is
    to make sure that you never pass undef to readlink on Perl 5.14 or
    earlier.

    Perl 5.8.x is somewhat supported. The use of implicit $_ with readlink
    in Perl 5.8.x is not supported and will throw an exception. It is
    recommended that you either upgrade to at least Perl 5.10 or pass an
    explicit argument of readlink when using this module.
