VERSION
    1.2

SYNOPSIS
      #!/usr/bin/perl -w
      use strict;
      use Email::Filter;
      use Email::Filter::Rules;

      my $maildir = '/home/jbisbee/mail/';
      my $msg = Email::Filter->new(emergency => $maildir . 'emergency');

      my $mail_lists = Email::Filter::Rules->new(
          rules => '/home/jbisbee/bin/mail_lists'
      );

      if (my $mail_list_folder = $mail_lists->apply_rules($msg)) {
          $msg->accept($maildir . $mail_list_folder);
      }

      $msg->accept($maildir . 'inbox');

    Where the 'rules' can be a filename, array ref, or scalar and looks like
    this

DESCRIPTION
    Email::Filter::Rules is a simple way to route e-mail into folders
    without having to touch your filter script. I used to edit my filter
    script often to add or remove e-mail lists and often would fat finger
    something and enter a typo. This would result in all my e-mail bouncing
    and all in all would be a real bummer.

    I wanted to make it syntax simple so it wouldn't end up looking like to
    awful procmail recipe or some cryptic piece of junk.

USAGE
    Simply put, a rule consists of a destination folder, one to many
    Email::Filter method names, and a substring to test the result of the
    method call.

      DESTINATION FOLDER <space> Email::Filter->$METHOD(S) <space> SUBSTRING

    where a rule looks like this

      lists/perl/pm/southflorida    to:cc southflorida-pm@mail.pm.org

    each rule is tested and quotemeta is used on the substring

      $msg->to =~ /southflorida-pm\@mail\.pm\.org/i
      $msg->cc =~ /southflorida-pm\@mail\.pm\.org/i

    and the destination folder is returned for the first matching test

      lists/perl/pm/southflorida

    and now I have the mail folder, I can tell the Email::Filter object to
    accept to that folder.

    So thats it, short, simple, and to the point. No more boucing e-mails by
    editing my filter directly. :)

CONSTRUCTOR
  Email::Filter::Rules->new( rules => $rules )
    *   rules

        Can be a scalar, array reference, or a file name name.

    *   debug

        Boolean to turn on warnings during apply_rules

METHODS
  $efr->apply_rules( $email )
    Pass in an e-mail object and attempt to call methods you defined in your
    rules file on it.
