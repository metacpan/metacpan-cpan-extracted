0.004 - 2024-09-30
  - BREAKNG CHANGE: Function previously named Vector::dot was actually cosine,
    and is now renamed to Vector::cos.  New Vector::dot is a pure dot product
    with no normalization.
  - PDL integration: you may now pass 2-element or 3-element ndarray objects
    for any parameter that wants a vector.  You may additionally pass higher
    dimension ndarrays to the project and project_inplace functions to get
    parallel processing.
  - Fixed bug where passing a hashref to project() gave back a vector object.
  - New Math::3Space::Projection objects for converting to 4x4 OpenGL matrix
