* This paekage should be renamed to Sensor::Network and cleaned up and
  modernized. It also should probably use some standard for the string
  storage, like YAML.
* make Games::3D::Signal into an object which can get passed around instead
  of a simple number, allowing for TTL (TimeToLive - to avoid infinite loops
  when relaying signals) and the real signal origin to be passed around. Or
  maybe add this just as parameters to signal() and output() because this
  saves us the overhead of object creation/destruction!
* Implement "Objective", to track player objectives per level (some that
  must be fullfilled, some that are optional, and some that should not
  be fullfilled, as well as changing them from "must/can fullfill" to "no
  longer necc."
* different interpolation formulas for state changes
* templates are hirachical, e.g. 'Physical::Food' needs to inherit
  from 'Physical'. However, get_key(), validate() etc are not taking this into
  account. Also, each template should store everything it inherited, to get
  rid of the looking up of these values over and over again. (Construct 
  hirarchy tree after all templates have been loaded? That would avoid that
  you need to write them out in order (shortest class name first)

Please send me test-reports, your experiences with this and your ideas - I love
to hear about my work!
