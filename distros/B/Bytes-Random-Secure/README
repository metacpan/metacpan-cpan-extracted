Bytes::Random::Secure

Generate strings of cryptographic-quality pseudo-random bytes as a string of
raw bytes, hex digits, MIME Base64, MIME QuotedPrintable, or just long ints.


CONFIGURATION

If you require better performance, install Math::Random::ISAAC::XS.  It will
be automatically detected, and will provide better performance as you generate
random bytes.


INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test

Or preferably, let your favorite CPAN installer do the work for you.  Users

particularly if building this distribution on Perl versions that
preceed Perl 5.8.9.
