  * update for context stack changes in Perl 5.23.8

  * update to accommodate PERL_OP_PARENT builds of Perl 5.21.11 or later
    (which is the default from Perl 5.25.1)

version 1.20; 2015-10-21

  * update for distinct PADNAMELIST type in Perl 5.21.7

  * update for multideref optimisation in Perl 5.21.7, by a disgusting
    hack that depends on a flaw in the optimisation (which may disappear

version 1.18; 2013-09-21

  * bugfix: store peep chain link reliably under threads

  * doc typo fix

version 1.17; 2013-08-04

  * bugfix: correct the dtrace-related macro squashing for Perls prior
    to 5.13.8, where the macros had the wrong number of parameters and

    aelemfast and aelemfast_lex

  * test compatibility with Devel::CallParser

version 1.14; 2011-04-27

  * bugfix: never unhook peephole optimiser, because unhooking is liable
    to fail if anything else hooked it

  * bugfix: revise check for dorassign opcode to cope with FreeBSD's
    mutant Perl 5.8 that has it

  * test POD syntax and coverage

version 1.13; 2011-04-25

    an alias{} block is an open paren

  * bugfix: handle variant structure of entersub op which lacks (ex-)list
    op as direct child

  * bugfix: squash bogus dtrace-related macro definitions that are picked
    up due to defining PERL_CORE

  * switch all pp functions to internal linkage

  * avoid some compiler warnings

  * include .cvsignore file in distribution

1.12  Tue Feb 22 20:47 GMT 2011
	- Updated to work with Perl version 5.13.10, where GvGP() and
	  GvCV() are not directly-assignable lvalues

1.11  Thu Jan 13 20:23 GMT 2011

	- Modify source filter test to use Filter::Util::Call directly
