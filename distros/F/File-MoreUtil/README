NAME
    File::MoreUtil - File-related utilities

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.61 of File::MoreUtil (from Perl
    distribution File-MoreUtil), released on 2017-07-11.

SYNOPSIS
     use File::MoreUtil qw(file_exists l_abs_path dir_empty);

     print "file exists" if file_exists("/path/to/file/or/dir");
     print "absolute path = ", l_abs_path("foo");
     print "dir exists and is empty" if dir_empty("/path/to/dir");

DESCRIPTION
FUNCTIONS
    None are exported by default, but they are exportable.

  file_exists($path) => BOOL
    This routine is just like the -e test, except that it assume symlinks
    with non-existent target as existing. If "sym" is a symlink to a
    non-existing target:

     -e "sym"             # false, Perl performs stat() which follows symlink

    but:

     -l "sym"             # true, Perl performs lstat()
     -e _                 # false

    This function performs the following test:

     !(-l "sym") && (-e _) || (-l _)

  l_abs_path($path) => STR
    Just like Cwd::abs_path(), except that it will not follow symlink if
    $path is symlink (but it will follow symlinks for the parent paths).

    Example:

     use Cwd qw(getcwd abs_path);

     say getcwd();              # /home/steven
     # s is a symlink to /tmp/foo
     say abs_path("s");         # /tmp/foo
     say l_abs_path("s");       # /home/steven/s
     # s2 is a symlink to /tmp
     say abs_path("s2/foo");    # /tmp/foo
     say l_abs_path("s2/foo");  # /tmp/foo

    Mnemonic: l_abs_path -> abs_path is analogous to lstat -> stat.

    Note: currently uses hardcoded "/" as path separator.

  dir_empty($dir) => BOOL
    Will return true if $dir exists and is empty.

FAQ
  Where is file_empty()?
    For checking if some path exists, is a regular file, and is empty
    (content is zero-length), you can simply use the "-z" filetest operator.
