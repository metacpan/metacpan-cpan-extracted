 o CPAN Release 2.62

 o Fix HTTPS support with newer LWP versions, a HUGE thanks
 to Sebastian Willing <sewi@cpan.org> for taking care of this.

Mon Feb 18 2013 Michael South <msouth@cpan.org>
 o CPAN Release 2.61

 o Correcting error in Makefile.PL :(

Mon Feb 18 2013 Michael South <msouth@cpan.org>
 o CPAN Release 2.60

 o using 'localhost' when creating daemons for any local/*.t
   tests.  Some machines don't return a reachable domain
   for `hostname`.  This may need further refinement.
 o exiting explicitly from daemon in local/*.t code that
   creates them.  This was already done in timeouts.t,
   adding it to the other two locations.
 o attempting a fix for https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=46821
   without having reproduced.  Should at least do no harm, though.
 o applied (some of) the patch for https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=35775
   by CHORNY@cpan.org (issue with use of `pwd` on Win32)
 o adding (generated) META.yml and META.json 

Fri Feb 15 2013 Michael South <msouth@cpan.org>

Mon May 26 2003 Marc Langheinrich <marclang@cpan.org>

 o some miscenallenous bugfixes (undefined values, etc)

Fri May 23 2003 Marc Langheinrich <marclang@cpan.org>
 
 o CPAN Release 2.55 (namefix release: didn't realize PAUSE had some
   special handling mechanisms for x.yy_zz version names, which resulted
   in the 2.54_21 release not being indexed)

 o No code changes to 2.54_21!

Tue Mar 11 2003 Marc Langheinrich <marclang@cpan.org>

 o Release 2.54_20 (beta testing only)

 o bugfix: [Parallel::UserAgent.pm] called _new_response without fully
   qualifiying the package (should be LWP::UserAgent::_new_response),
   as this was screwed up in the bugfix in 2.54_19
 
Wed Feb 19 2003 Marc Langheinrich <marclang@cpan.org>

 o Release 2.54_19 (beta testing only)
 
 o rearranged tests and copied LWP's t/TEST file for ease-of-use

 o bugfix: [Parallel::Protocol.pm] receiving into a file would always
   _append_
 
 o bugfix: [Parallel::UserAgent.pm] called _new_reponse without $self->
 
 o bugfix: [Parallel::UserAgent.pm] _single_request would drop parameters
   when delegating to ->register
 
 o bugfix: [Parallel::UserAgent.pm] send_request and request would create
   new useragent, without copying currents ua's settings. now they operate
   on $self instead (thus retaining all current settings)
 
 o bugfix: [Parallel::RobotUA.pm] fixed syntax errors!! :-(
 
 o bugfix: [Parallel::RobotUA.pm] $rules->visit would not be updated if
   an earlier visit had failed (even though the current one worked), or
   if we requested the robots.txt file itself.
 
 o bugfix: [Parallel::RobotUA.pm] added ->use_sleep support
 
 o checked [Parallel::RobotUA] against LWP::RobotUA 1.18

   (compatible with LWP::RobotUA behavior)

   add "->new", aargh!)
 
 o bugfix: [Parallel::Protocol::ftp.pm] added $key and $account vars to make
   conn_cache work

 o bugfix: [Parallel::Protocol::ftp.pm] fixed various syntax errors!!! :-|

 o renamed Parallel::Protocol::http::connect method to _connect (to indicate
   that it's private)

 o bugfix: [Parallel::Protocol::http.pm] handle_connect had wrong return

 o bugfix: [Parallel::Protocol::http.pm] pushback buffer (also spotted by
   Dongqiang Bai)

   format

 o CPAN Release 2.54

   parallel.t and timeouts.t

   ParallelUA.(forgot to update $VERSION variable accordingly)

 o Fixed missing SYNOPSIS element in ParallelUA.pm and RobotPUA.pm

 o Blocked ftp-scheme handling since it wasn't working at all. Thanks
   to Gary Foster for actually being the first person to try using

   inherent most of their code from the corresponding LWP modules.
