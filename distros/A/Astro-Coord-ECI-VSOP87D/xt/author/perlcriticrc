[Perl::Critic::Policy::InputOutput::ProhibitInteractiveTest]

# Perl::Critic and Perl Best Practices prefer the IO::Interactive

# ARGV is used for input, and that you don't want to be interactive
# if output goes to a pipe. I do not want these assumptions, but
# rather than disable them in the code I am simply assigning them
# a severity slightly higher than I currently use.
