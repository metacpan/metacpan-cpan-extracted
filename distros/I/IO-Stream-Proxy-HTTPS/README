VERSION

SYNOPSIS

        use IO::Stream;
        use IO::Stream::Proxy::HTTPS;
    
        IO::Stream->new({
            ...
            plugin => [
                ...
                proxy   => IO::Stream::Proxy::HTTPS->new({
                    host    => 'my.proxy.com',
                    port    => 3128,
                    user    => 'me',
                    pass    => 'mypass',

        });

DESCRIPTION

    This module is plugin for IO::Stream which allow you to route stream
    through HTTPS (also called CONNECT) proxy.

    You may use several IO::Stream::Proxy::HTTPS plugins for single
    IO::Stream object, effectively creating proxy chain (first proxy plugin
    will define last proxy in a chain).

 EVENTS

    When using this plugin event RESOLVED will never be delivered to user
    because target {host} which user provide to IO::Stream will never be
    resolved on user side (it will be resolved by HTTPS proxy).

    Event CONNECTED will be generated after HTTPS proxy successfully
    connects to target {host} (and not when socket will connect to HTTPS
    proxy itself).

INTERFACE

    new({ host=>$host, port=>$port })

    new({ host=>$host, port=>$port, user=>$user, pass=>$pass })

      Connect to proxy $host:$port, optionally using basic authorization.

DIAGNOSTICS

    {host}+{port} required

      You must provide both {host} and {port} to
      IO::Stream::Proxy::HTTPS->new().

    {user}+{pass} required

      You have provided either {user} or {pass} to
      IO::Stream::Proxy::HTTPS->new() while you have to provide either both
      or none of them.

    {fh} already connected

      You have provided {fh} to IO::Stream->new(), but this is not
      supported by this plugin. Either don't use this plugin or provide
      {host}+{port} to IO::Stream->new() instead.
