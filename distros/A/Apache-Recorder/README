Overview: 
The Apache::Recorder module is an implementation of a session recorder, 
much like a macro recorder that you might use with a GUI application.  
It allows you to "record" each of the clicks that you make during an 
http session for later playback.  However, Apache::Recorder does not 
provide capabilities to "play-back" a recorded session.  To "play-back" 
a session, you need two additional modules: (1) HTTP::RecordedSession 
to "thaw" the session, and format it appropriately; and (2) A module 
(such as HTTP::Monkeywrench or HTTP::WebTest) which wraps testing 
logic around the "thawed" session.

Architecture:
1. Use recorder.pl to set a cookie.
2. Apache::Recorder will look for sessions containing a valid recorder.pl 
   cookie.  When it finds such a session it will write information to the 
   filesystem which can be played back at some later point.  See INSTALL
   for httpd.conf instructions.
3. Write a brief script which calls HTTP::RecordedSession to configure 
   your session data appropriately for HTTP::Monkeywrench or HTTP::
   WebTest.  perldoc HTTP::RecordedSession after installation for a 
   sample script.

Installation:

See INSTALL.
