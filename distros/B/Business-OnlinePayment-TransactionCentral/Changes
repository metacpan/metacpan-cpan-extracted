        - depend on B:OP v3

        - add/finish ECHECK support (google of TCInterfaceGuide indicated
          s/processcheck.asp/processcheckonline.asp/)
        - fix another problem with transactions going through but coming back
          denied: Returned "Auth" field can have trailing whitespace, wtf!
