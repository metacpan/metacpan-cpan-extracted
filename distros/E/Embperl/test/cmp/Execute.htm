<HTML><TITLE>Test for Embperl::Execute</TITLE><BODY>
<H1> 1.) Include from memory</H1>
<P>Here is some text</P>
<H1> 2.) Include from memory with some Embperl code</H1>
^<table> ?<tr> ?<td>a1</td> ?<td>b2</td> ?<td>c3</td> ?</tr> ?</table> ?</P>
<H1> 3.) Include from memory with passing of variables</H1>
<P>Transfer some vars Some Var !</P>
<H1> 4.) Change the variable, but not the code</H1>
<P>Transfer some vars Do it again !</P>
<H1> 5.) Use @param to pass parameters</H1>
<P>Use @param to transfer some data (1 2 3 4) !</P>
<H1> 6.) Use @param to pass parameters and return it</H1>
<H3> $p[0] is vara and $p[1] is varb<H3><P>Got data in @param (vara varb) !</P><P>Change data in @param to (newA newB) !</P>
<H3> $p[0] is now newA and $p[1] is now newB<H3><H1> 7.) Presetup %fdat and @ffld</H1>
<P><table><tr><td>fdat</td><td>text</td></tr><tr><td>test</td><td>value</td></tr></table></P>
<H1> 8.) Inculde a file</H1>

Here it starts with some HTML Text<P>

All values should be undefined at the first include and
apear at the second include:
<P>

$a =  <BR>
$b =  <BR>
$c =  <BR>
$d =  <BR>
$e =  <BR>


First of all assign a value:
<BR>

Now we have some 'Umlaute':


Now lets look what we are getting from this:<BR>
(this is the value in $a) (this is the value in $a) &auml;&ouml;&uuml;<BR>

And now a and b together: (this is the value in $a)(this is the value in $a) &auml;&ouml;&uuml;<P>

Here we have some HTML tags within the perl code, Embperl will delete them!<BR>

57
SELECT *  FROM a ORDER BY b USING &lt;; Hi There&gt;
Here we have something which looks like a HTML tag, but does not start with<br>
a character, Embperl does not change them!<BR>

SELECT * FROM a ORDER BY b USING &lt;; Hi There&gt;
Embperl will also translate HMTL escapes to the right characters i.e. $a &amp;lt; 6 will get the perl expression $a &lt; 6: <BR>

Now they should have a value

$a = (this is the value in $a) <BR>
$b = (this is the value in $a) &auml;&ouml;&uuml; <BR>
$c = 57 <BR>
$d = 1 <BR>
$e = 2 <BR>

<P>Ok.<P>


<H1> 9.) Inculde a file and return output in a scalar</H1>
<H3>
Here it starts with some HTML Text<P>

All values should be undefined at the first include and
apear at the second include:
<P>

$a = <BR>
$b = <BR>
$c = <BR>
$d = <BR>
$e = <BR>

$e = 2 <BR>

<P>Ok.<P>

<H1> 10.) Test $req_rec inside Execute</H1>

<html>
<head>
<title>Test for $req_rec in Embperl</title>
</head>

$conf = &lt;undef&gt; <br> 
^\$_\[0\] = Embperl::Req=HASH\(0x 
$_[1] = &lt;undef&gt; <br> 

^\$rec_rec  = Apache2?(::RequestRec)?=SCALAR\(0x
^\$\$rec_rec = -?\d+<br>

^Apache->request    = Apache2?(::RequestRec)?=SCALAR\(0x
^\$\{Apache->request\} = -?\d+<br>

^\${Apache->request} = \$\$req_rec \?  yes
