NAME
    WWW::Jawbone::Up - Unofficial Jawbone UP API

SYNOPSIS
      use WWW::Jawbone::Up;

      my $up = WWW::Jawbone::Up->connect('alan@eatabrick.org', 's3kr3t');

      my $user = $up->user;
      my $score = $up->score;

      say $user->name . ' walked ' . $score->move->distance . 'km today';

      my $hours = int($score->sleep->asleep / 3600);
      my $minutes = int($score->sleep->asleep / 60); % 60;

      say $user->name . " slept for ${hours}h${minutes}m last night";

DESCRIPTION
    WWW::Jawbone::Up is a perl binding to the unofficial Jawbone UP API.
    After authenticating you can find interesting bits of data. The version
    number of this library should reflect the associated version of the
    Jawbone API but I have no way of knowing if they will be sane with their
    version numbers so we'll see how that pans out.

METHODS
  connect($email, $password)
    Authenticates with the API. Will return undef if there are any errors,
    possibly also dying or warning about them.

  user()
    Returns a WWW::Jawbone::Up::User object representing the currently
    authenticated user.

  feed($date)
    Returns an array of WWW::Jawbone::Up::Feed objects for the given $date.
    If no date is given, the current date is used.

  score($date)
    Returns a WWW::Jawbone::Up::Score object for the given $date. If no date
    is given, the current date is used.

  band($start, $end)
    Returns an array of WWW::Jawbone::Up::Tick objects for the given time
    range. Both $start and $end should be epoch times (seconds since epoch).
    If no range is given, I think the current day is used, but I haven't
    really researched that fact too much.

  workouts($date)
    Returns an array of WWW::Jawbone::Up::Workout objects for the give
    $date. If no $date is given, I think some number of recent workouts are
    given, but I haven't really researched that fact too much.

TODO
    The documentation for this distribution is utterly lacking. I will fix
    that sometime soon.
