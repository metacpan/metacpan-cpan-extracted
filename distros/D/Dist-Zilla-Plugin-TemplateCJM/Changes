Revision history for Dist::Zilla::Plugin::TemplateCJM

Note: This plugin was previously part of Dist-Zilla-Plugins-CJM.
Some version numbers are skipped here because there were no changes
to this plugin in that release of Dist-Zilla-Plugins-CJM.


5.001  2015-12-12
	- don't add coercions to named types

5.000  2015-12-05
	- don't "use Moose::Autobox" (Dist::Zilla doesn't use it anymore)
	- drop support for Dist::Zilla 4.
	  (Tests were failing, and Dist::Zilla 5 is 2 years old now.)

4.24   2015-10-03
	- Module::Metadata 1.000028 returns "main" as the package
	  of a pure-POD file with no package statement (while
	  previous versions returned the empty string).	 TemplateCJM
	  now handles either case, substituting a module name derived
	  from the filename.
