Revision history for Perl extension PGXN::Site

0.22.0  2021-05-29T21:32:54Z
      - Reorganized the nav and footer links. There are now fewer of them, and
        the nav links focus on content, while the footer focuses on metadata.
      - Added a "Colophon" section to the About page, including links to credit
        the original site and logo designers, as well as the typeface and icons.
      - Added the "generator" meta element to the header to report the version,
        since it, too, has been removed from the footer.
      - Added /tags/, with the search form defaulting to searching tags, and
        the tag cloud, since it does not appear on the home page on mobile.
      - Increased the line size of search results and list tables.
      - Added a search form to the Users page, and moved the list of letters
        to search to a horizontal list.
      - Opened up the spacing in block quotes so that the icon doesn't crowd
        the text. Applies to error, warning, and success blocks, too.
      - Knocked 40px off the height of the header on mobile devices.
      - Added OpenGraph/Twitter unfurl support to all pages. Should make
        excerpts look nicer for links posted on social media.

0.21.0  2021-05-28T02:07:56Z
      - Added required --base-url option. Required for absolute URLs, such as
        the fallback icon for Gravatar.
      - Moved the code to load another distribution version from the version
        select list to a script element, so that it can be allowed via a
        content security policy hash.
      - Increased the size of the download and browse buttons on the
        distribution page.
      - Updated the layout to be responsive for usability and readability on
        mobile an tablet devices.

0.20.3  2021-05-23T14:02:05Z

      - Restored the blue margin on the right and at the bottom of the logo
        icon.
      - Fixed the incomplete sentence on the identity page (/art).
      - Removed Safari mask-icon, as Safari will use the regular favicon in
        more recent versions, and its styling wasn't quite right in any case,
        since no background color was supported.
      - Simplified the favicon config, removing older stuff and stuff unlikely
        to be used.
      - Merged html.css into layout.css, to reduce the number of files to load.

      - Fixed broken logo links on the art page.
      - Fixed favicon errors and expanded and improved favicon support for
        various browsers.

        workflows.

      - Removed the border around linked images, removed the colors for list
        items, and softened the color for definition terms.

        Examples for managing PGXN can now be found in the pgxn/pgxn-ops
        repository on GitHub.
      - Updated URLs to HTTPS wherever possible and fixed some broken links.
      - Reformatted the Multimarkdown text in the source code to be
        user-friendly as plain text.
      - Now require SemVer v0.10.0 for compatibility with proper support for the
        semver 2.0.0 spec (aside from version parts larger than 32 bits).
      - Eliminated unwanted indentation in code blocks. Thanks to Hans Ginzel
        for the report! (#11).
      - Updated the FAQ. It was pretty seriously out of date in a few ways.
      - Replaced low-res icons with SVGs from the

        it links to the latest version of the distribution released by the
        user, rather than the latest released by any user.
      - Replaced use of the smartmatch operator with List::Util::first so as
        to eliminate deprecation warnings from Perl 5.18.

0.10.1  2012-12-12T07:31:22Z
      - Added an Nginx configuration example to the mirroring page.
      - Updated GitHub URLs to point to `/pgxn/` rather than `/theory/`

      - Updated tagline for sponsor Younicycle.

      - Updated links in the About page.
      - Reversed the display of the browse and download icons for
        distributions listed on the user page. This is so that they are in the
        same order as on the distribution page. Per gripe from Marti Raudsepp.
      - Now showing an error page when the `in` parameter to `/search` is
        missing, rather than throwing an exception and returning 500.
      - Added Email::MIME, Email::Sender::Simple, and Software::License to the
        list of requirements. The were inadvertently omitted.
      - Added all core and Plack modules to the list of requirements, just to
        be safe.
      - Switched to 12 tag cloud sizes and enabled the CSS for the sizes, now
        that PGXN has enough tags to make it interesting.
      - Added Identity page a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0
        Unported License, description of fonts, and links to original art
        work.
      - Added `Capfile` for capistrano deployment.
      - Added `eg/debian_init`, an example init script for Debian that runs
        PGXN::Site on Starman.
      - Updated the question about a command-line client in the FAQ to point
        to the client that was actually implemented, rather than the client
        that was never written.

0.7.4   2011-05-18T17:54:32
      - The router tests are now skipped if PGXN::API::Searcher is not
        installed.

0.7.3   2011-05-18T17:44:31
      - Fixed alignment of definition list items on user page. Reported by
        Daniele Varrazzo (Issue #1).

0.7.1   2011-05-12T18:11:02
      - Added `use blib` to `pgxn_site_server` so that the server will always
        find the HTML files generated from the MultiMarkdown source files.
      - Added namespace::autoclean to prerequisites. Its omission was
        inadvertent.
      - Backported to support Perl 5.10.

0.7.0   2011-05-03T02:40:50
      - Replaced the gradient background image wih one that uses dithering.
        This'eliminates banding in the image, which the eagle-eyed Marti
        Raudsepp noticed and was kind enough to fix.
      - Added Test::File::Contents to the build prerequisites. Its omission
        was an oversight.
      - Replaced `pgxn_site.psgi` with `pgxn_site_server`. This program wraps
        the functionality of `plackup` to do proper option processing.

0.6.5   2011-04-30T20:04:44
      - Added Data::Dump to list of requirements. Was inadvertently omitted.

        preserved as found in the distribution metadata file.

      - Fixed offsetting of the "Abstract" item below "Other Releases" in the
        distribution metadata section of the distribution file. Seen in
        Firefox on Ubuntu.
      - All distribution and extension names and versions, as well as tags and
        user nicknames, are now lowercased for use in URIs.

0.6.1   2011-04-22T18:51:42
      - Improved the styling of table headers, as seen in `/spec/` and
        documentation HTML.
      - Added a note under the "Distributions" header for users who have yet
        to release a distribution.
      - Added redirect from `/meta/spec.html` to the new URL, `/spec/`.

      - Requests should now all be returned with an appropriate
        `Content-Length` header.
      - A search request with no query parameter now redirects back to the

0.5.1   2011-04-13T18:12:57
      - Added the PGXN::Site version string as a query parameter to the CSS
        URLs. This should force them to be reloaded after the release of any
        new version by browsers that would otherwise cache them.
      - Fixed the display of the table of contents sidebar on the
        documentation page on Firefox. Per gripe from depesz.
      - Moved the HTML rendering of the spec to /spec/.

0.5.0   2011-04-13T02:25:37
      - An invalid search query, such as "*", "", or "?", now returns a 400
        response.
      - Removed `robots.txt` route. This baby's going live tomorrow!
      - Changed tags on home page to all be the same size and color. Just for
        now, while there are a limited number of tags all with only one
        associated distribution. It looks awful when they're all huge and red.
      - Using the user's profile page for the Gravatar link URL if the user
        has specified no URL.
      - Added documentation for all controller action methods.

0.2.0   2011-04-07T18:02:50
      - Fixed some URIs so that they no longer reveal private URLs from behind
        a proxy server. That is, all local URLs should be relative to the
        document root, and not contain the scheme or host name.
      - Added Gravatar to user page.
      - Added `reverse_proxy` option, so that the default gravatar URL will
        work properly for proxied servers.
      - Added tag cloud to the home page.
      - Added page with list of recent releases.

0.1.0   2011-04-03T20:24:35
      - Initial version.
