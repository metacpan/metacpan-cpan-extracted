	-polled micropatent pdf to give time to get the stuff ready 
	-added a new "document" type to MICROPATENT, called "data" (versus "pdf", "html", etc.) from the "worksheet" they provide, that delivers a hash of data about the patent (inventors, assignee, citations, claims, etc.) 
	-increased File::Temp version to 0.17 to account for ->seek method

0.101.0 finished Aug 2007

	-added Perl::Critic testing (with some exclusions, and only used when you are me )
	-added test of network accessibility (basically for firewalls)
	-got rid of some warnings that wrote over testing
	-made pod testing conditional on being me- so others will not need to add modules for testing

	TODO -  use HTTP::Response, better use of "is_success" and "message", more tests
	 Longer range:  Add modules for machine translations from Japan and Korea
	 timing of patent retrieval from various offices
	 test coverage

0.09 (beginning Nov 14) tried to account for Micropatent javascript that refreshes document delivery page until document is delivered.
    Did not add a test for this condition, as the condition (slowness) depends on MicroPatent website.
	Accounted for it by repeatedly clicking the "Click Here for Current Status of Order" form, assumed to be the first form on the page.

0.08 removed extraneous print statements

0.07 changed tests for MicroPatent to skip if username and password not supplied
  put in a longer timeout for LWP::UserAgent to allow for slow patent offices

	USPTO changed their interface: H1,523 is out, H001,523 is in!
	    PP8,901 is out, PP08,901 is in!
