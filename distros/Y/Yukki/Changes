0.121790  2012-06-26 21:29:22 America/Chicago

    * Bugfix: The spreadsheet plugin could get stuck in a loop if a variable in
      a page referred to itself. This problem has been corrected.

0.121700  2012-06-17 23:43:56 America/Chicago

    * Bugfix: Corrected the "Fork me on Github" banner, which was showing a
      broken image link.
    * Bugfix: # Titles containing colons no longer confuse the Yukki page
      viewer. These should display properly now.
    * Bugfix: The git-version.t test runs without requiring a git repository
      now. (HT: Michael Aquilina)
    * Slides show a smaller font for lists and syntax highlighted code, which
      works better on smaller screens.
    * Adds a new "plain" view that provides the HTML with only a DIV wrapping
      it, which is handy for embedding into another page.
    * Upgrade to Plupload v1.5.4
    * Upgrade to jQuery 1.7.2 and jQuery UI 1.8.21
    * Now requires Git::Repository v1.18

      use the default configuration, you will need it. Added to make quick setup
      easier.

    * Bugfix: The diff viewer was broken and has been for a couple versions and
      I didn't notice. This is fixed.
    * Bugfix: If you have a version of git before 1.7.2, you will get a warning
      in the tests and a special error message telling that diffs can't work
      without an upgrade.
    * Bugfix: A few visual issues have been cleaned up, particularly in the
      Slides view.
    * The Slides view will use any ID attributes set on a slide element to
      update the page's hash tag, which allows for direct linking to a slide.
    * The Slides vcentered class works with pure CSS (though, only with modern
      browsers that support some version of the translate style).
    * A new SyntaxHighlight plugin is available for syntax highlighting in the
      yukkitext.

      handled correctly within Yukki now.

    * The navigation menu is now split up into 3 different menus (repository,

    * Bugfix: There was a random "HERE" warning that was being output that
      should never made it to release.
    * Added the spreadsheet functionality to the wiki
    * Yukkitext, attachments, and spreadsheet features now use the new plugins
      system. Only the yukkitext and attachments plugins are on by default.
    * The yukki-setup script shows the remote setup URL for the yukki repository
      again.
    * The base URL for the web site is more configurable. The scripts and styles
      should not longer be specified in the configuration file using absolute
      paths starting with a slash (unless you want them to be absolute and not
      biased by the base URL of the yukki site).

0.111060  2011-04-15 21:27:56 America/Chicago

    * Bugfix: Corrected a problem with the navigation menu on edit pages
    * There is now a "scripts" and "styles" section for listing JavaScript and
      CSS files (respectively) for inclusion in the shell template. If not
      present, a default list is provided. (See the man page for
      Yukki::Web::Settings for details.)

    * Made some small style adjustments
    * Added more tests, particularly tests for setting up a new Yukki
      installation.

    * Added a diff viewer, which will show a diff for any selected pair of
      revisions from the hsitory page. This differ is naive and makes some
      uglifying mistakes that still need to be addressed.
    * Added a history viewer, which will show all the revisions for a page.
    * Added more tests

0.110880  2011-03-28 22:07:48 America/Chicago
    
    * Bugfix: Links sometimes treated whitespace incorrectly
    * Bugfix: Escaping links did not work in some cases
    * Up until now passwords were stored in plain text. They will no be stored
      as a salted hash using the digest configured in the digest directory (or
      SHA-512 if not given). If someone out there has been trying this out, you
      MUST run yukki-passwd for every user to hash the passwords.
    * Added the yukki-passwd script to help with password changes.
    * Added the first few unit tests.
    * The configuration file is now checked for correctness when it is loaded.
