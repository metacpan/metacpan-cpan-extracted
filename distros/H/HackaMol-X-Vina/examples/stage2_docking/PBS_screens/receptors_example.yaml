# YAML configuration file for virtual screen:
# 
#   perl broadcast.pl this.yaml 
# 
# will generate a configuration yaml in 'scratch' and broadcast a call on receptors_dock.pl  
# for each json file contained in 'data' to the PBS queueing system. Docking output will 
# be written to a json file in 'scratch'.  'scratch' and 'data' can point to the same path,
# and often they will. I recommend keeping a pristine starting set of jsons for spawning
# "new beginnings" (i.e. let them be separate for the first screen and then switch data from
# the pristine to your new dirty scratch space) 
#
# See broadcast.pl and receptors_dock.pl for more info.
#
# The ligands will be changed most frequently, so we start here
# 
# I think it may be possible to set the center generation to a coderef in YAML, but not
# sure how yet.  The receptors_dock.pl is actually ssCenters_receptors_dock.pl and is 
# specific to the use case in the HackaMol paper.
