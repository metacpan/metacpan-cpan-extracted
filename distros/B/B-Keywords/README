NAME
    B::Keywords - Lists of reserved barewords and symbol names

SYNOPSIS
      use B::Keywords qw( @Symbols @Barewords );
      print join "\n", @Symbols,
                       @Barewords;

DESCRIPTION
    "B::Keywords" supplies several arrays of exportable keywords: @Scalars,
    @Arrays, @Hashes, @Filehandles, @Symbols, @Functions, @Barewords,
    @BarewordsExtra, @TieIOMethods, @UNIVERSALMethods and @ExporterSymbols.

    The @Symbols array includes the contents of each of @Scalars, @Arrays,
    @Hashes, @Functions and @Filehandles.

    Similarly, @Barewords adds a few non-function keywords and operators to
    the @Functions array.

    @BarewordsExtra adds a few barewords which are not in keywords.h.

    All additions and modifications are welcome.

    The perl parser uses a static list of keywords from regen/keywords.pl
    which constitutes the strict list of keywords @Functions and @Barewords,
    though some @Functions are not functions in the strict sense. Several
    library functions use more special symbols, handles and methods.

DATA
    @Scalars
    @Arrays
    @Hashes
    @Filehandles
    @Functions
        The above are lists of variables, special file handles, and built in
        functions.

    @Symbols
        This is just the combination of all of the above: variables, file
        handles, and functions.

    @Barewords
        This is a list of other special keywords in perl including operators
        and all the control structures.

    @BarewordsExtra
        This is a list of barewords which are missing from keywords.h,
        handled extra in the tokenizer.

    @TieIOMethods
        Those are special tie or PerlIO methods called by the perl core,
        namely for tieing or PerlIO::via (or both of those) or threads.

    @UNIVERSALMethods
        Methods defined by the core package UNIVERSAL.

    @ExporterSymbols
        Variables or functions used by Exporter (some internal), which is
        almost as good as being keywords, for you mustn't use them for any
        other purpose in any package that isa Exporter, which is quite
        common.

EXPORT
    Anything can be exported if you desire. Use the :all tag to get
    everything.
