VERSION
    Version 0.41

SYNOPSIS

    use App::CmdDispatch;

    my %cmds = (
        start => {
            code => sub { my $app = shift; print "start: @_\n"; },
            synopsis => 'start [what]',
            help => 'Start whatever is to be run.',
        },
        stop => {
            code => sub { my $app = shift; print "stop @_\n"; },
            synopsis => 'stop [what]',
            help => 'Stop whatever is to be run.',
        },
        stuff => {
            code => sub { my $app = shift; print "stuff: @_\n"; },
            synopsis => 'stuff [what]',
            help => 'Stuff to do.',
        },
        jump => {
            code => sub { my $app = shift; print "jump: @_\n"; },
            synopsis => 'jump [what]',
            help => 'Start whatever is to be run.',
        },
    );

    my $processor = App::CmdDispatch->new( \%cmds );
    $processor->run( @ARGV );

DESCRIPTION
    One way to map a series of command strings to the code to execute for that
    string is a dispatch table. The simplest dispatch table maps strings
    directly to code refs. A more complicated dispatch table maps strings to
    objects that provide a wider interface than just a single function call. I
    often find I want more than a single function and less than a full object.

    App::CmdDispatch falls in between these two extremes. One thing I always
    found that I needed with my dispatch table-driven scripts was decent help
    that covered all of the commands. App::CmdDispatch makes each command map
    to a hash containing a code reference and a pair of help strings.

    Since beginning to use git, I have found git's alias feature to be
    extremely helpful. App::CmdDispatch supports reading aliases from a config
    file.
