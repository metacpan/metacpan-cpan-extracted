NAME

    Alien::libtool24 - (Deprecated) Built or find libtool 2.4.x

VERSION

    version 0.06

SYNOPSIS

    From your Alien::Base based Build.PL:

     Alien::Base::ModuleBuild->new(
       ...
       alien_bin_requires => {
         'Alien::libtool24' => 0,
       },
       alien_build_commands => [
         ...
         'libtool ...',
         ...
       ],
       ...
     );

    From regular Perl:

     use Alien::libtool24;
     use env qw( @PATH );
     
     # puts libtook in the PATH if it isn't already there
     unshift @PATH, Alien::libtool24->bin_dir;
     system 'libtool ...';

DESCRIPTION

    This module is deprecated. Use Alien::libtool instead, it uses newer
    better Alien tech.

    This module will download and install libtool 2.4.x if it is not
    already available on your system. As with other Alien::Base based
    distributions it will install into a distribution based share directory
    which will not override or otherwise malign your system software.

METHODS

 bin_dir

     my $dir = Alien::libtool24->bin_dir;

    Returns the directory which contains the libtool and libtoolize
    scripts. Adding this to the PATH usually means that you can run these
    commands without fully qualifying them. Returns empty list if libtool
    is already in the PATH.

 dist_dir

     my $dir = Alien::libtool24->dist_dir;

    Returns the base install directory of libtool if it was installed by
    building it from source, rather than using your system's version of
    libtool.

CAVEATS

    This works(ish) on Windows, in that it installs, but libtool installs
    itself as a shell script which can be used with Alien::MSYS, but is not
    very useful by itself. Alien::Hunspell uses this module successfully,
    but somewhat hackishly on Windows.
