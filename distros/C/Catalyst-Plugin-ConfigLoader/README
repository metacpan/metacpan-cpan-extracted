NAME
    Catalyst::Plugin::ConfigLoader - Load config files of various types

SYNOPSIS
        package MyApp;

        # ConfigLoader should be first in your list so
        # other plugins can get the config information
        use Catalyst qw( ConfigLoader ... );

        # by default myapp.* will be loaded
        # you can specify a file if you'd like
        __PACKAGE__->config( 'Plugin::ConfigLoader' => { file => 'config.yaml' } );

      In the file, assuming it's in YAML format:

        foo: bar

      Accessible through the context object, or the class itself

       $c->config->{foo}    # bar
       MyApp->config->{foo} # bar

DESCRIPTION
    This module will attempt to load find and load a configuration file of
    various types. Currently it supports YAML, JSON, XML, INI and Perl
    formats. Special configuration for a particular driver format can be
    stored in "MyApp->config->{ 'Plugin::ConfigLoader' }->{ driver }". For
    example, to pass arguments to Config::General, use the following:

        __PACKAGE__->config( 'Plugin::ConfigLoader' => {
            driver => {
                'General' => { -LowerCaseNames => 1 }
            }
        } );

    See Config::Any's "driver_args" parameter for more information.

    To support the distinction between development and production
    environments, this module will also attemp to load a local config (e.g.
    myapp_local.yaml) which will override any duplicate settings. See
    get_config_local_suffix for details on how this is configured.

METHODS
  setup( )
    This method is automatically called by Catalyst's setup routine. It will
    attempt to use each plugin and, once a file has been successfully
    loaded, set the "config()" section.

  load_config
    This method handles loading the configuration data into the Catalyst
    context object. It does not return a value.

  find_files
    This method determines the potential file paths to be used for config
    loading. It returns an array of paths (up to the filename less the
    extension) to pass to Config::Any for loading.

  get_config_path
    This method determines the path, filename prefix and file extension to
    be used for config loading. It returns the path (up to the filename less
    the extension) to check and the specific extension to use (if it was
    specified).

    The order of preference is specified as:

    *   $ENV{ MYAPP_CONFIG }

    *   $ENV{ CATALYST_CONFIG }

    *   "$c->config->{ 'Plugin::ConfigLoader' }->{ file }"

    *   "$c->path_to( $application_prefix )"

    If either of the first two user-specified options are directories, the
    application prefix will be added on to the end of the path.

  get_config_local_suffix
    Determines the suffix of files used to override the main config. By
    default this value is "local", which will load "myapp_local.conf". The
    suffix can be specified in the following order of preference:

    *   $ENV{ MYAPP_CONFIG_LOCAL_SUFFIX }

    *   $ENV{ CATALYST_CONFIG_LOCAL_SUFFIX }

    *   "$c->config->{ 'Plugin::ConfigLoader' }->{ config_local_suffix }"

    The first one of these values found replaces the default of "local" in
    the name of the local config file to be loaded.

    For example, if $ENV{ MYAPP_CONFIG_LOCAL_SUFFIX } is set to "testing",
    ConfigLoader will try and load "myapp_testing.conf" instead of
    "myapp_local.conf".

  finalize_config
    This method is called after the config file is loaded. It can be used to
    implement tuning of config values that can only be done at runtime. If
    you need to do this to properly configure any plugins, it's important to
    load ConfigLoader before them. ConfigLoader provides a default
    finalize_config method which walks through the loaded config hash and
    calls the "config_substitutions" sub on any string.

  config_substitutions( $value )
    This method substitutes macros found with calls to a function. There are
    a number of default macros:

    *   "__HOME__" - replaced with "$c->path_to('')"

    *   "__ENV(foo)__" - replaced with the value of $ENV{foo}

    *   "__path_to(foo/bar)__" - replaced with "$c->path_to('foo/bar')"

    *   "__literal(__FOO__)__" - leaves __FOO__ alone (allows you to use
        "__DATA__" as a config value, for example)

    The parameter list is split on comma (","). You can override this method
    to do your own string munging, or you can define your own macros in
    "MyApp->config->{ 'Plugin::ConfigLoader' }->{ substitutions }". Example:

        MyApp->config->{ 'Plugin::ConfigLoader' }->{ substitutions } = {
            baz => sub { my $c = shift; qux( @_ ); }
        }

    The above will respond to "__baz(x,y)__" in config strings.
