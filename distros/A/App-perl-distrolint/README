NAME

    App::perl::distrolint - distribution-wide linting tools for Perl
    distributions

SYNOPSIS

       use App::perl::distrolint;
    
       exit App::perl::distrolint->new->run( @ARGV );

DESCRIPTION

    This module implements an application for applying various code-linting
    tests across the source code for an entire Perl distribution. The
    individual checks performed are described more in the various
    App::perl::distrolint::Check::* modules.

    At present in this very early version, many of these checks are very
    opinionated, doing things specific to the way I personally lay out my
    code. This distribution currently exists largely to allow people to see
    the kinds of things that are possible, and also acts as a demonstration
    of the use of Text::Treesitter and tree-sitter-perl to be used as a
    static linting tool for Perl source code.

    A limited amount of customisation and configuration can be performed on
    a per-project or per-user basis, by writing settings into
    distrolint.ini files. This is described in more detail in
    App::perl::distrolint::Config.
