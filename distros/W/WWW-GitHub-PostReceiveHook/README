NAME
    WWW::GitHub::PostReceiveHook - A simple means of receiving GitHub's web
    hooks

SYNOPSIS
    Create the listener:

        use WWW::GitHub::PostReceiveHook;

        WWW::GitHub::PostReceiveHook->new(
            routes => {
                '/myProject' => sub { my $payload = shift; },
                '/myOtherProject' => sub { run3 \@cmd ... }
            }
        )->run_if_script;

    Save it. Toss it in /cgi-bin or mount it as a psgi app. Add
    http://your.host/myProject to github.com/myname/myproject/admin/hooks.

DESCRIPTION
    WWW::GitHub::PostReceiveHook is a CGI / PSGI wrapper for GitHub that
    tries to be simple like a local git hook.

METHODS
  new
    Argument: routes => HashRef[CodeRef]

    Sets up Web::Simple to listen on each route. If a GitHub payload is
    POST'd to a given path, it will be deserialized and passed to that paths
    callback.

QUESTIONS
  Why WWW::GitHub::PostReceiveHook?
    Sometimes you just want to kick off an email, or run a small script when
    someone commits to github. In situations like these, busting out a
    full-sized framework like Dancer/Catalyst is almost always overkill to
    listen for GitHub's postreceive hooks. Use this module and you can be
    off to the races after a quick copy-paste.

  Can't I do this just as easily using Web::Simple?
    Yes! But most people searching cpan for 'github postreceive' probably
    haven't heard of Web::Simple.

SEE ALSO
    <http://help.github.com/post-receive-hooks/> for details on what gets
    POST'd by GitHub

    WWW::GitHub::PostReceiveHook uses Web::Simple to do the heaving lifting,
    so that would be a good start.

    Dancer, Catalyst, CGI
