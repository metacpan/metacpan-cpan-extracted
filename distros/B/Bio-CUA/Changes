Revision history for Bio-CUA

1.04    Thu May 28 10:37:37 EDT 2015
        1. Update Tutorial.pod by correcting format errors and reword
        sentences.
		2. Change program names as follows:
		   build_cai_param.pl -> cai_codon.pl
		   build_tai_param.pl -> tai_codon.pl
		   calculate_CUB.pl   -> cub_seq.pl
		The new names reflect the functions of the programs better.
		3. Add a new program tabulate_codons.pl to count codons in
		sequence files.
		4. Add one more method 'all_codons' to the module
		Bio::CUA::CodonTable.
		5. Update help documentation.

1.03    Wed May 20 13:25:29 EDT 2015
        1. Add option --fop-param to calculate_CUB.pl so that the
		program can compute the metric Fop.
		2. Reformat the 'usage' information of the scripts in the
		'bin' directory.
		3. Add a tutorial file Tutorial.pod.

1.02    Sat May 16 23:04:25 EDT 2015
        Use a perl module t/env.pm to set environment variables during
		installation test, replacing the original way of setting
		environment variables using 'export' in makefile, because the
		latter does not work for NetBSD/FreeBSD/Windows systems

1.01    Thu Apr 30 16:51:09 EDT 2015
        First version, including methods to calculate codon usage bias
		indice at both codon and sequence levels.
