NAME
    HTML::HTML5::ToText - convert HTML to plain text

SYNOPSIS
     my $dom = HTML::HTML5::Parser->load_html(IO => \*STDIN);
     print HTML::HTML5::ToText
         ->with_traits(qw/ShowLinks ShowImages RenderTables/)
         ->new()
         ->process($dom);

DESCRIPTION
    The HTML::HTML5::ToText module itself produces a pretty boring
    conversion of HTML to text, but thanks to Moose and MooseX::Traits it
    can easily be composed with "traits" that improve the output.

  Compositor
    "with_traits(@traits)"
        This class method creates a new class that composes
        "HTML::HTML5::ToText" with each trait given, returning the name of
        that class. That class will be a subclass of "HTML::HTML5::ToText".

        Traits are taken to be in the "HTML::HTML5::ToText::Trait" namespace
        unless overridden by prefixing the trait with "+".

  Constructors
    *   "new(%attrs)"

        Creates a new instance of the class.

    *   "new_with_traits(traits => \@traits, %attrs)"

        Shortcut for:

         HTML::HTML5::ToText->with_traits(@traits)->new(%attrs)

  Attributes
    As per usual for Moose classes, accessor methods are provided for each
    attribute, and attributes may be set in the constructor.

    "HTML::HTML5::ToText" does not actually provide any attributes, but some
    traits may.

  Methods
    *   "process($node)"

        Processes an XML::LibXML::Node and returns a string. May be called
        as a class or object method.

        Because "process" likes to perform some alterations to the DOM tree,
        as a first stage it makes a clone of the DOM tree (so that it can
        leave the original intact). If you don't care about any changes to
        the tree, and want to save a bit of CPU, then you can suppress the
        cloning by passing a true value as a second argument to "process".

         HTML::HTML5::ToText->process($node, 'no_clone')

    *   "process_string($string)"

        As per "process", but first parses the string with
        HTML::HTML5::Parser. The second argument (for cloning) does not
        exist as cloning is not needed in this case.

    There are also methods named (in upper-case) after every element defined
    in HTML5: "STRONG($node)", "DL($node)", "IMG($node)" and so on, which
    "process($node)" delegates to; and a "textnode($node)" method which is
    the equivalent for text nodes. These are the methods which traits tend
    to modify.

EXTENDING
    MooseX::Traits makes it pretty easy to cleanly extend this module. Say
    for example, we want to add the feature where the HTML "<del>" element
    is output as the empty string. (The default behavious treats it rather
    like "<div>".)

     {
       package Local::SkipDEL;
       use Moose::Role;
       override DEL => sub { '' };
     }
 
     print HTML::HTML5::ToText
       -> with_traits(qw/ShowLinks ShowImages +Local::SkipDEL/)
       -> process_string($html);

    Or maybe we want to force "<big>" elements into uppercase?

     {
       package Local::Embiggen;
       use Moose::Role;
       around BIG => sub
       {
         my ($orig, $self, $elem) = @_;
         return uc $self->$orig($elem);
       };
     }
 
     print HTML::HTML5::ToText
       -> with_traits(qw/+Local::Embiggen/)
       -> process_string($html);

  Similar Modules on CPAN
    *   HTML::FormatText

        About 15 years old, and still maintained, this falls into the
        "mature" category. This module is based on HTML::Tree, so its HTML
        parser may not behave as closely to modern browsers as
        HTML::HTML5::Parser's parsing, but its conversion to text seems
        somewhat better than HTML::HTML5::ToText's default output (i.e. with
        no traits applied).

        At the time of writing, its bug queue on rt.cpan.org lists eight
        bugs, some quite serious. However, since being taken over by its
        latest maintainer, there seems to be progress being made on them.

        Fairly extensible, but not in the mix-and-match traits way allowed
        by HTML::HTML5::ToText.

    *   HTML::FormatText::WithLinks

        An extension of HTML::FormatText.

    *   HTML::FormatText::WithLinks::AndTables

        An extension of HTML::FormatText::WithLinks.

        The code that deals with tables is pretty crude compared with
        HTML::HTML5::ToText::Trait::RenderTables. It doesn't support
        "colspan", "rowspan", or the "<th>" element.

    *   LEOCHARRE::HTML::Text

        Very basic conversion; basically just tag stripping using regular
        expressions.

    *   HTML::FormatExternal

        Passes HTML through external command-line tools such as `lynx`.
        Obviously this has limited portability.

    Everyone behind Moose. No way I could have done all this in a few hours
    without Moose's strange brand of meta-programming!
