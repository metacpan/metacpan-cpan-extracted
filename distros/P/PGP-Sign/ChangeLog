2007-04-27  Russ Allbery  <rra@stanford.edu>

	* VERSION.pm: PGP::Sign 0.20 released.

	* t/basic.t: Add reasons for the skipped tests.
	* t/locale.t: Likewise.

	* t/pod.t: New check for POD formatting.

2007-04-22  Russ Allbery  <rra@stanford.edu>

	* makepm.PL: Unbuffer output since we're prompting the user.

2004-08-08  Russ Allbery  <rra@stanford.edu>

	* VERSION.pm: PGP::Sign 0.19 released.

	* Sign.in: Remove e-mail addresses from HISTORY since the
	documentation is automatically put on the web.

	* test.pl: Moved to...
	* t/basic.t: ...here.  Updated the search for the data directory
	accordingly.  Print more information when detached signatures fail
	to verify.
	* t/locale.t: New test.

	* Sign.in (pgp_verify): Replaced verification code for GnuPG with
	code that uses --status-fd, so that it will work independent of
	locale.  Documented limitations in the error reporting and
	recommended setting TMPDIR.

2004-08-04  Russ Allbery  <rra@stanford.edu>

	* VERSION.pm: PGP::Sign 0.18 released.

	* debian/changelog: Add Debian packaging files.
	* debian/compat: Likewise.
	* debian/control: Likewise.
	* debian/copyright: Likewise.
	* debian/rules: Likewise.

	* Makefile.PL: Also remove trustdb.gpg; GnuPG generates it
	automatically and the copy we were distributing contained nothing
	of interest.
	* data/trustdb.gpg: Delete.

2002-06-28  Russ Allbery  <rra@stanford.edu>

	* VERSION.pm: PGP::Sign 0.17 released.

	* Sign.in: Update CAVEATS to be slightly less optimistic about the
	chances of a major overhaul.  Add a URL for RFC 2440 and this
	module's web site.  Add a COPYRIGHT AND LICENSE section.  Update
	the markup in the documentation.

2000-10-08  Russ Allbery  <rra@stanford.edu>

	* test.pl: Skip test 9 completely under GnuPG, as the whitespace
	behavior changes from release to release; GnuPG 1.0.2 is back to
	the previous behavior of releases before GnuPG 1.0.1.

	* Makefile.PL: Added random_seed to @clean, created by GnuPG 1.0.2.

2000-02-12  Russ Allbery  <rra@stanford.edu>

	* VERSION.pm: PGP::Sign 0.16 released.

	* Makefile.PL: Clean up all the additional junk created in data by
	running the test suite with PGP 6.5.

	* makepm.PL: Also look for PGP 6.5, distinguish between PGP 2 and
	PGP 6 by checking its output when run without any arguments, and
	add the PGP6 PGPSTYLE.

	* Sign.in: Added a waitpid() in pgp_verify() to avoid leaving
	zombies behind.	 Updated comments and documentation for the new
	support for PGP 6.5.2 and for the change to GnuPG so that it does
	the same whitespace munging as PGP.

2000-02-06  Russ Allbery  <rra@stanford.edu>

	* test.pl: The signature in test 9 now expected to fail on all
	versions of PGP, as the release GnuPG was changed to follow PGP in
	its handling of whitespace.

1999-06-13  Russ Allbery  <rra@stanford.edu>

	* VERSION.pm: PGP::Sign 0.15 released.

	* Sign.in: Added a call to fcntl() to clear close-on-exec on the
	passphrase pipe in pgp_sign(), needed for Perl 5.005_03.  Added a
	note to the documentation that PGP may want to write randseed.bin
	in its key ring directory.

	* Makefile.PL: Sign.in and Sign.pm moved to the root directory,
	updated ABSTRACT.

	* makepm.PL: Sign.in and Sign.pm moved to the root directory.

1999-02-10  Russ Allbery  <rra@stanford.edu>

	* VERSION.pm: PGP::Sign 0.14 released.

	* PGP/Sign.in: Use long options with GnuPG rather than -bat, add
	--force-v3-sigs so that generated signatures will be compatible
	with PGP 5.0, and added documentation of this.

	* makepm.PL: Search for gpg and pgps as well, set both PGPS and
	PGPV with prompts and guesses for each, prompt for and set
	PGPSTYLE, and pick up overrides to avoid interactivity from a file
	rather than from the command line.

	* Makefile.PL: Added support for PGPS, PGPV, and PGPSTYLE settings
	on the command line, changed to guess a few things if not
	specified and to pass values to makepm.PL via a separate file
	rather than the command line.  Ugly hack to fix Makefile
	dependencies removed, since it's no longer necessary.

1999-02-09  Russ Allbery  <rra@stanford.edu>

	* test.pl: Changed the testing key ID to "testing", added special
	casing on PGPSTYLE for testing signatures of whitespace-munged
	data against unmunged data since GnuPG will still consider the
	signature valid, added two new tests for version 3 and version 4
	DSS signatures, and had GnuPG skip the PGP 2.6.2 RSA signature
	check.

	* PGP/Sign.in: Added support for GnuPG and PGP 5.0.  This involves
	a new PGPSTYLE global variable, support for separate programs for
	signing and verification, and lots of choosing between styles all
	over the code.	The documentation has also been updated to reflect
	this support, including a long note about whitespace munging
	incompatibilities between different versions and warnings about
	potential future API changes for this module.  Also added a SEE
	ALSO section and a thank you to the folks who send in GnuPG
	support originally.

	* data/message.asc.v4: New file.  Version 4 DSS signature.

	* data/message.asc: New file.  Version 3 DSS signature.

	* data/pubring.gpg: New file.  GnuPG key ring for testing.
	* data/secring.gpg: New file.
	* data/trustdb.gpg: New file.

	* data/pubring.pkr: New file.  PGP 5.0 key ring for testing.
	data/secring.pkr: New file.

	* data/message.sig: Renamed from message.asc; this is the PGP
	2.6.2 RSA signature.

	* data/pubring.pgp: Change key ID of test key to testing, since
	GPG requires at least five characters in the key ID.
	data/secring.pgp: Likewise.

1998-12-04  Russ Allbery  <rra@stanford.edu>

	* VERSION.pm: PGP::Sign 0.13 released.

	* Makefile.PL: Add two ugly hacks, one to let someone set the path
	to PGP on the command line of "perl Makefile.PL," and the second
	to strip the resulting extra dependency from the processPL
	section.  Pass the path to PGP to makepm.PL on the command line if
	it's given.

	* makepm.PL: Add support for accepting the path to PGP on the
	command line (and not prompting in that case).

1998-12-02  Russ Allbery  <rra@stanford.edu>

	* VERSION.pm: PGP::Sign 0.12 released.

	* makepm.PL: The path to PGP that the user inputs should override
	any other path to PGP that we find.

1998-11-27  Russ Allbery  <rra@stanford.edu>

	* VERSION.pm: PGP::Sign 0.11 released.

	* Makefile.PL: Added a MAN3PODS directive to prevent MakeMaker
	from generating a PGP::PGP::Sign man page, changed the formatting
	of the 5.005-only section.

1998-11-26  Russ Allbery  <rra@stanford.edu>

	* Makefile.PL: Added ABSTRACT and AUTHOR for Perl versions 5.005
	and higher.  This is for the PPD to go with a binary distribution,
	and for Perl Resource Kits.

	* VERSION.pm: PGP::Sign 0.10 released.

	* PGP/Sign.in: Modified to be PGP/Sign.in instead of Sign.pm,
	added special markers for the path to PGP and the version number,
	added support for $PGPPATH, fixed a bug in finding the PGP version
	number of a signature, cleaned up and reformatted the
	documentation, added a note about PGP environment variables, added
	bugs concerning our lack of support for PGP v5 and GPG, added a
	thank you to Andrew Ford in the history section of the
	documentation.

	* Makefile.PL: Run makepm.PL to generate PGP/Sign.pm, tell
	MakeMaker where the actual module is, and get our version number
	from VERSION.pm now.

	* makepm.PL: New file.	Now generate PGP/Sign.pm automatically
	from this file, which finds and prompts for the path to PGP and
	grabs the version from VERSION.pm.

	* VERSION.pm: New file.	 We now pull our release version number
	from here rather than the CVS revision of Sign.in.

	* test.pl: New file.  Added a reasonably good test suite that
	works with public and private key rings included with the
	distribution.  Based on work by Andrew Ford.

	* data/message: New file.
	* data/message.asc: New file.
	* data/pubring.pgp: New file.
	* data/secring.pgp: New file.

1998-07-05  Russ Allbery  <rra@stanford.edu>

	* Sign.pm: PGP::Sign 0.9 released.

	* Sign.pm: Fixed the way I was dealing with open3() file handles
	and $?.	 One needs to keep the PID and do an explicit waitpid(),
	or the status you get may be something random.	Also cleaned
	things up a little and explicitly set $/ in case our calling
	program had it set to something odd.

1997-08-18  Russ Allbery  <rra@stanford.edu>

	* Sign.pm: PGP::Sign 0.8 released.
	
	* Sign.pm (pgp_verify): Added a umask 077 (and restoration of
	umask on completion) since we're creating temporary files.
	(pgp_sign): Added a check to see if we got a signature at all.

1997-08-15  Russ Allbery  <rra@stanford.edu>

	* Sign.pm: PGP::Sign 0.7 released.

	* Sign.pm (pgp_verify): Changed to use O_EXCL when opening /tmp
	files to avoid symlink attacks.
	
	* Sign.pm: PGP::Sign 0.6 released.

	* Sign.pm: Added output() to munge trailing spaces if $MUNGE is
	set, modified write_data() to send everything through output()
	rather than printing it directly, added documentation of the new
	behavior to the PODs.

1997-07-29  Russ Allbery  <rra@stanford.edu>

	* Sign.pm: Removed $ORS, which was a hack that we don't need any
	more.  That work should be done by the client, and the client is
	capable of it.	Added a pgp_error() function (not exported by
	default) to retrieve the error message, since that's a cleaner
	user interface.	 Changed the signature verification code to verify
	detached signatures, which means we now use temporary files.
	Added a $TMPDIR global variable to specify the directory in which
	to create temporary files.  Changed the documentation to include
	notes about all of this.

1997-07-27  Russ Allbery  <rra@stanford.edu>

	* Sign.pm: Broke write_data() off into a separate function, added
	pgp_verify() and tested it, changed the documentation to mention
	it as well.  Fixed a few minor bugs, made to use @ERROR correctly,
	added documentation.
