NAME
    CPAN::DistnameInfo - Extract distribution name and version from a
    distribution filename

SYNOPSIS
      my $pathname = "authors/id/G/GB/GBARR/CPAN-DistnameInfo-0.02.tar.gz";

      my $d = CPAN::DistnameInfo->new($pathname);

      my $dist      = $d->dist;      # "CPAN-DistnameInfo"
      my $version   = $d->version;   # "0.02"
      my $maturity  = $d->maturity;  # "released"
      my $filename  = $d->filename;  # "CPAN-DistnameInfo-0.02.tar.gz"
      my $cpanid    = $d->cpanid;    # "GBARR"
      my $distvname = $d->distvname; # "CPAN-DistnameInfo-0.02"

      my %prop = $d->properties;

DESCRIPTION
    Many online services that are centered around CPAN attempt to associate
    multiple uploads by extracting a distribution name from the filename of
    the upload. For most distributions this is easy as they have used
    ExtUtils::MakeMaker or Module::Build to create the distribution, which
    results in a uniform name. But sadly not all uploads are created in this
    way.

    "CPAN::DistnameInfo" uses heuristics that have been learnt by
    <http://search.cpan.org/> to extract the distribution name and version
    from filenames and also report if the version is to be treated as a
    developer release

    The constructor takes a single pathname, returning an object with the
    following methods

    cpanid
        If the path given looked like a CPAN authors directory path, then
        this will be the the CPAN id of the author.

    dist
        The name of the distribution

    distvname
        The file name with any suffix and leading directory names removed

    filename
        If the path given looked like a CPAN authors directory path, then
        this will be the path to the file relative to the detected CPAN
        author directory. Otherwise it is the path that was passed in.

    maturity
        The maturity of the distribution. This will be either "released" or
        "developer"

    properties
        This will return a list of key-value pairs, suitable for assigning
        to a hash, for the known properties.

    version
        The extracted version
