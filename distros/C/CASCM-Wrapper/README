DESCRIPTION


This module is a wrapper around CA Software Change Manager's (formerly
known as Harvest) commands. It provides a perl-ish interface to setting
the context in which each command is executed, along with optional
loading of context from files as well as parsing output logs.



CONTEXT


The context is a _hash of hashes_ which contain the following types of
keys:

-   global

    This specifies the global context. Any context set here will be
    applied to every command that uses it.

        my $global_context = {
            global => {
                b  => 'harvest',
                eh => 'user.dfo',
            },
        };

-   command specific

    This provides a command specific context. Context set here will be
    applied only to those specific commands.

        my $hco_context = {
            hco => {
                up => 1,
                vp => '\repository\myapp\src',
                pn => 'Checkout Items',
            },
        };

The global and command context keys are synonymous with the command line
options detailed in the CA-SCM Reference Manual. Options that do not
require a value should be set to '1'. i.e. {hco => {up => 1} } is
equivalent to hco -up. The methods are intelligent enough to apply only
the context keys that are used by a command. For e.g. a global context
of vp will not apply to hcp.

The common options _i_ and _di_ are not applicable and ignored for all
commands. See "SECURITY"

The following methods are available to manage context


set_context($context)

Sets the context. Old context is forgotten. The argument provided must
be a hash reference


update_context($context)

Updates the current context. The argument provided must be a hash
reference


load_context($file)

This loads the context from an _INI_ file. The root parameters defines
the global context. Each sectional parameter defines the command
specific context. Old context is forgotten.

    # Load context file at initialization.
    #   This will croak if it fails to read the context file
    my $cascm = CASCM::Wrapper->new( { context_file => $file } );

    # Alternatively
    $cascm->load_context($file) or die $cascm->errstr;

This is a sample context file

    # Sample context file

    # Root parameters. These define the 'global' context
    b  = harvest
    eh = user.dfo

    # Sectional parameters. These define the 'command' context

    [hco]
        up = 1
        vp = /repository/myapp/src

    [hcp]
        st = development

NOTE: This method requires Config::Tiny in order to read the context
file.


get_context()

Returns a hash reference of current context

    my $context = $cascm->get_context();
    use Data::Dumper;
    print Dumper($context);

You can also get a command specific context by passing the command as an
argument

    my $hco_context = $cascm->get_context('hco');
    use Data::Dumper;
    print Dumper($hco_context);



CA-SCM METHODS


Almost every 'h' command that uses a context is supported. The command
names are synonymous with the methods used to invoke them.

Every method accepts two optional arguments. The first is an hash
reference that overrides/appends to the context for that method. This
allows setting a context only for that specific method call. The second
is an array of arguments that is passed on to the 'h' command. Any
arguments provided is passed using the '-arg' option.

    # No parameters. Everything required is already set in the context
    $cascm->hdlp() or die $cascm->errstr;

    # Array of arguments
    $cascm->hci( @files ) or die $cascm->errstr;

    # Override/Append to context
    $cascm->hci( { p => 'new_package' }, @files ) or die $cascm->errstr;

SECURITY


This module uses the _di_ option for executing CA-SCM commands. This
prevents any passwords from being exposed while the command is running.
The temporary _di_ file is deleted irrespective if the outcome of the
command.



DRY RUN


The CASCM methods can be called in a _dry run_ mode. Where the method
returns the full command line, without executing anything. This can be
useful for debugging.

    $cascm = CASCM::Wrapper->new( { dry_run => 1 } );
    $cascm->set_context($context);
    $cmd = $cascm->hsync();
    print "Calling hsync() would have executed -> $cmd";

dry_run can also be toggled using contexts. For e.g.,

    $cascm->hsync({dry_run => 1,});



LOGGING


Since CA-SCM commands output only to log files, this module allows
parsing and logging of a command's output. Log::Any is required to use
this feature, which in turn allows you to use any (supported) Logging
mechanism. When using this, any o or oa options specified in the context
will be ignored. Your scripts will need to load the appropriate
Log::Any::Adapter to capture the log statements. The CA-SCM log is
parsed and the messages are logged either as _INFO_, _WARN_ or _ERROR_.

    # Using Log4perl

    use CASCM::Wrapper;
    use Log::Log4perl;
    use Log::Any::Adapter;

    Log::Log4perl->init('log4perl.conf');
    Log::Any::Adapter->set('Log4perl');

    # Get logger
    my $log = Log::Log4perl->get_logger();

    # Set parse_logs to true. This will croak if Log:Any is not found.
    my $cascm = CASCM::Wrapper->new( { parse_logs => 1 } );

    # You can also set the logging category
    #    This is currently available with Log4perl only
    $cascm->parse_logs('mylogger');

    # Set Context
    my $context = { ... };
    $cascm->set_context($context);

    # Calling the method automatically will parse the log output into the Log4perl object
    # The output is also logged in the 'CASCM::Wrapper' category.

    $cascm->hco(@files) or die $cascm->errstr;



ERROR HANDLING


All methods return true on success and undef on failure. The error that
most likely caused the _last_ failure can be obtained by calling the
errstr method. The exit value of the last _h_ command can be obtained by
calling the exitval method.



DEPENDENCIES


CA-SCM r12 (or higher) client. Harvest 7.1 might work, but has not been
tested.

The CA-SCM methods depends on the corresponding commands to be available
in the _PATH_

At least Perl 5.6.1 is required to run.

Optionally, Config::Tiny is required to read context files

Optionally, Log::Any and Log::Any::Adapter is required to parse CA-SCM
log files
