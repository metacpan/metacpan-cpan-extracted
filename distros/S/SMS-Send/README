NAME
    SMS::Send - Driver-based API for sending SMS messages

SYNOPSIS
      # Create a sender
      my $sender = SMS::Send->new('SomeDriver',
          _login    => 'myname',
          _password => 'mypassword',
      );
      
  # Send a message
      my $sent = $sender->send_sms(
          text => 'This is a test message',
          to   => '+61 (4) 1234 5678',
      );
      
  # Did the send succeed.
      if ( $sent ) {
          print "Message sent ok\n";
      } else {
          print "Failed to send message\n";
      }

DESCRIPTION
    "SMS::Send" is intended to provide a driver-based single API for sending
    SMS and MMS messages. The intent is to provide a single API against
    which to write the code to send an SMS message.

    At the same time, the intent is to remove the limits of some of the
    previous attempts at this sort of API, like "must be free internet-based
    SMS services".

    "SMS::Send" drivers are installed seperately, and might use the web,
    email or physical SMS hardware. It could be a free or paid. The details
    shouldn't matter.

    You should not have to care how it is actually sent, only that it has
    been sent (although some drivers may not be able to provide certainty).

METHODS
  installed_drivers
    The "installed_drivers" the list of SMS::Send drivers that are installed
    on the current system.

  new
      # The most basic sender
      $sender = SMS::Send->new('Test');
      
  # Indicate regional driver with ::
      $sender = SMS::Send->new('AU::Test');
      
  # Pass arbitrary params to the driver
      $sender = SMS::Send->new('MyDriver',
          _login    => 'adam',
          _password => 'adam',
      );

    The "new" constructor creates a new SMS sender.

    It takes as its first parameter a driver name. These names map the class
    names. For example driver "Test" matches the testing driver
    SMS::Send::Test.

    Any additional params should be key/value pairs, split into two types.

    Params without a leading underscore are "public" options and relate to
    standardised features within the SMS::Send API itself. At this time,
    there are no usable public options.

    Params with a leading underscore are "private" driver-specific options
    and will be passed through to the driver unchanged.

    Returns a new SMS::Send object, or dies on error.

  send_sms
      # Send a message to a particular address
      my $result = $sender->send_sms(
          text => 'This is a test message',
          to   => '+61 4 1234 5678',
      );

    The "send_sms" method sends a standard text SMS message to a destination
    phone number.

    It takes a set of named parameters to describe the message and its
    destination, again split into two types.

    Params without a leading underscore are "public" options and relate to
    standardised features within the SMS::Send API itself.

    text
        The "text" param is compulsory and should be a plain text string of
        non-zero length. The maximum length is currently determined by the
        driver, and exceeding this length will result in an exception being
        thrown if you breach it.

        Better functionality for determining the maximum-supported length is
        expected in the future. You input would be welcome.

    to  The "to" param is compulsory, and should be an international phone
        number as indicated by a leading plus "+" character. Punctuation in
        any form is allowed, and will be stripped out before it is provided
        to the driver.

        If and only if your driver is a regional driver (as indicated by a
        ::-seperated name such as AU::Test) the "to" number can also be in a
        regional-specific dialing format, "without" a leading plus "+"
        character.

        Providing a regional number to a non-regional driver will throw an
        exception.

    Any parameters with a leading underscore are considered private
    driver-specific options and will be passed through without alteration.

    Any other parameters without a leading underscore will be silently
    stripped out and not passed through to the driver.

    After calling "send_sms" the driver will do whatever is required to send
    the message, including (potentially, but not always) waiting for a
    confirmation from the network that the SMS has been sent.

    Given that drivers may do the actual mechanics of sending a message by
    quite a large variety of different methods the "send_sms" method may
    potentially block for some time. Timeout functionality is expected to be
    added later.

    The "send_sms" returns true if the message was sent, or the driver is
    fire-and-forget and unable to determine success, or false if the message
    was not sent.
