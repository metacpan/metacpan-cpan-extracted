Graphics-Magick-ColorHistogram version 1.00
===========================================

This module sends syslog messages over a network socket. It works like
Sys::Syslog in setlogsock's 'udp', 'tcp', or 'unix' modes, but without
the significant CPU overhead of that module when used for high-volume
logging. Use of this specialized module is only recommended if 1) you
must use network syslog as a messaging transport but 2) need to minimize
the time spent in the logger.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

If GraphicsMagick is installed in a non-standard location, pass
--with-graphics-magick=/location/bin/GraphicsMagick-config to Makefile.PL.
