XML::Compile::Transport::SOAPHTTP - exchange XML-SOAP via HTTP

=head1 INHERITANCE

 XML::Compile::Transport::SOAPHTTP
   is a XML::Compile::Transport
   is a XML::Compile::SOAP::Extension

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use XML::Compile::Transport::SOAPHTTP;

 my $http = XML::Compile::Transport::SOAPHTTP->new(@options);
 my $send = $http->compileClient(@options2);

 my $call = $wsdl->compileClient
   ( operation => 'some-port-name'
   , transport => $send
   );

 my ($xmlout, $trace) = $call->($xmlin);

 $wsdl->compileCalls(transport => $send);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module handles the exchange of (XML) messages, according to the
rules of SOAP (any version).  The module does not known how to parse
or compose XML, but only worries about the HTTP aspects.

=item XML::Compile::Transport::SOAPHTTP-E<gt>B<new>(%options)

Create a SOAP-over-HTTP handler, implemented as a wrapper around
LWP::UserAgent.

If you need to change UserAgent settings (for instance at runtime),
you can always directly access the internal C<LWP::UserAgent> object
via L<userAgent()|XML::Compile::Transport::SOAPHTTP/"Accessors">.

B<Warning:> The C<keep_alive> and C<timeout> options are only used when
an default internal C<LWP::UserAgent> is created; this is only once in a
program.  Later instantiations of this ::SOAPHTTP will share that default
agent, even though these passed parameters have different parameters.
If that is not what you want, then pass your own C<user_agent> object to
the constructor to avoid the use of the default.

 -Option    --Defined in             --Default
  address     XML::Compile::Transport  'http://localhost'
  charset     XML::Compile::Transport  'utf-8'

  timeout                              180
  user_agent                           <created when needed>

=over 2

=item address => URI|ARRAY-of-URI

=item charset => STRING

=item keep_alive => BOOLEAN

When connection can be re-used.

=item timeout => SECONDS

The maximum time for a single connection before the client will close it.
The server may close it earlier.  Do not set the timeout too long, because
you want objects to be cleaned-up.

=item user_agent => LWP::UserAgent object

If you do not pass your own user agent, a default will be created for you.

[3.07] Returns the used LWP::UserAgent, available after the compilation
of the SOAP call(s).

=item $obj-E<gt>B<userAgent>( [$agent|<undef, %options>] )

Returns the User Agent which will be used.  You may change the
configuration of the $agent (the returned LWP::UserAgent object)
or provide one yourself.  See also L<new(user_agent)|XML::Compile::Transport::SOAPHTTP/"METHODS">.

Changes to the agent configuration can be made before or after the
compilation, or even inbetween SOAP calls.

=item $obj-E<gt>B<compileClient>(%options)

Compile an HTTP client handler.  Returned is a subroutine which is called
with a text represenation of the XML request, or an XML::LibXML tree.
In SCALAR context, an XML::LibXML parsed tree of the answer message
is returned.  In LIST context, that answer is followed by a HASH which
contains trace information.

=item action => URI

=item header => HTTP::Headers object

Versions of L<XML::Compile|XML::Compile>, L<XML::Compile::SOAP|XML::Compile::SOAP>, and LWP will be
added to simplify bug reports.

=item hook => CODE

=item kind => DIRECTION

What kind of interactie, based on the four types defined by WSDL(1):
C<notification-operation> (server initiated, no answer required),
C<one-way> (client initiated, no answer required), C<request-response>
(client initiated, the usual in both directions), C<solicit-response> (server
initiated "challenge").

=item method => 'POST'|'M-POST'

With C<POST>, you get the standard HTTP exchange.  The C<M-POST> is
implements the (Microsoft) HTTP Extension Framework.  Some servers
accept both, other require a specific request.

=item mime_type => STRING

=item mpost_id => INTEGER

With method C<M-POST>, the header extension fields require (any) number
to be grouped.

=item soap => 'SOAP11'|'SOAP12'|OBJECT

=item xml_format => 0|1|2

example: create a client

 my $trans = XML::Compile::Transport::SOAPHTTP->new
   ( address => 'http://www.stockquoteserver.com/StockQuote'
   );

 my $call = $trans->compileClient
   ( action  => 'http://example.com/GetLastTradePrice'
   );

 # $request and $answer are XML::LibXML trees!
 # see XML::Compile::SOAP::Client::compileClient() for wrapper which
 # converts from and to Perl data structures.

 my ($answer, $trace) = $call->($request);
 my $answer = $call->($request); # drop $trace info immediately

=item $obj-E<gt>B<headerAddVersions>($header)

=item XML::Compile::Transport::SOAPHTTP-E<gt>B<headerAddVersions>($header)

Adds some lines about module versions, which may help debugging
or error reports.  This is called when a new client or server
is being created.
