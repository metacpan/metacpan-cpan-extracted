IO::InSitu version 0.0.2

This module provides a function called open_rw(), that is passed two
filenames and returns two handles, one open for reading and the other
for writing. It's like doing to separate open() calls, except that it
detects cases where the input and output file are the same, and avoids
clobbering the input file when reopening it for output.
