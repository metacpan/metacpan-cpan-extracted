   I've seen it, I am pretty indifferent to it.

   Babylon 5 certainly presents a fresh perspective in the Sci-Fi universe.  I
   watch it weekly.
  '+++': ! >-
   I am a True Worshipper of the Church of Joe who lives eats breathes and
   thinks Babylon 5, and has Evil thoughts about stealing Joe's videotape
   archives just to see episodes earlier.  I am planning to break into the bank
   and steal the triple-encoded synopsis of the 5-year arc.
  '++++': |-
   I am J. Michael Straczynski
  '-': ! >-
   This show is sub-par.  The acting is wooden, the special effects are
   obviously poor quality.  In general, it seems like a very cheap Star Trek
   ripoff.
  '--': >-
   You call this Sci-Fi?  That is such a load of crap!  This show is just a
   soap with bad actors, piss-poor effects, and lame storylines.  Puh-leese.  
  _: |-
   Babylon 5

   Computers are a tool, nothing more.  I use it when it serves my purpose.
  '++': ! >-
   Computers are a large part of my existence.  When I get up in the morning,
   the first thing I do is log myself in.  I play games or mud on weekends, but
   still manage to stay off of academic probation.
  '+++': ! >-
   You mean there is life outside of Internet?  You're shittin' me!  I haven't
   dragged myself to class in weeks.
  '++++': ! >-
   I'll be first in line to get the new cybernetic interface installed into my
   skull.

   Anything more complicated than my calculator and I'm screwed.

   I've played the game and I'm pretty indifferent.
  '+': |-
   It's a fun, action game that is a nice diversion on a lazy afternoon.
  '++': ! >-
   I've played the shareware version and bought the real one and I'm actually
   pretty good at the game.  I occasionally download PWAD files and play them
   too.
  '+++': ! >-
   I crank out PWAD files daily, complete with new monsters, weaponry, sounds
   and maps.  I'm a DOOM God.  I can solve the original maps in nightmare mode
   with my eyes closed.
  '++++': |-
   I work for iD Software.
  '-': |-
   I've played the game and really didn't think it was all that impressive.
  '--': |-
   It's an overly-violent game and pure crap.
  '---': |-
   To hell with Doom, I miss Zork.
  '----': |-
   I've seen better on my Atari 2600.
  _: |-

   I read Dilbert infrequently, rarely understanding it.

   I read Dilbert daily, often understanding it.
  '++': |-
   I work with people that act a lot like Dilbert and his boss.
  '+++': |-
   I am a Dilbert prototype.
  '++++': ! >-
   I've received mail from Scott Adams.  I'm in the DNRC (Dogbert's New Ruling
   Class).
  '+++++': |-
   I am Scott Adams.
  '-': |-
   Is that the comic about the engineers?
  '--': |-
   Don't read it, but I think the dog is kinda cute.

   their organizational units.

   Yeah, I know what emacs is, and use it as my regular editor.
  '+': |-
   Emacs is great!  I read my mail and news with it!
  '++': |-
   I know and use elisp regularly!
  '+++': ! >-
   Emacs is my login shell!!  M-x doctor is my psychologist! I use emacs to
   control my TV and toaster oven!  All you vi people don't know what you're
   missing!  I read alt.relgion.emacs, alt.sex.emacs, and comp.os.emacs.
  '-': |-
   Emacs is too big and bloated for my tastes
  '--': |-

   I know what the geek code is and even did up this code.
  '+': ! >-
   I was once G++ (or higher), but the new versions are getting too long and
   too complicated.
  '++': |-
   I know what each letter means, but sometimes have to look up the specifics.
  '+++': ! >-
   I have memorized the entire geek code, and can decode others' codes in my
   head.  I know by heart where to find the current version of the code on the
   net.
  '++++': |-
   I have made a suggestion for future versions of the code.
  '+++++': |-
   I am Robert Hayden.

   a life.

   I know what Linux is, but that's about all.
  '!': |-
   I don't even know what Linux is!
  '+': ! >-
   I've managed to get Linux installed and even used it a few times.  It seems
   like it is just another OS.
  '++': ! >-
   I use Linux ALMOST exclusively on my system.  I've given up trying to
   achieve Linux.God status, but welcome the OS as a replacement for DOS.  I
   only boot to DOS to play games.
  '+++': ! >-
   I use Linux exclusively on my system.  I monitor comp.os.linux.* and even
   answer questions sometimes.
  '++++': ! >-
   I am a Linux wizard.  I munch C code for breakfast and have enough room left
   over for a kernel debugging.  I have so many patches installed that I lost
   track about ten versions ago.  Linux newbies consider me a net.god.
  '+++++': |-
   I am Linus, grovel before me.
  '-': ! >-
   I have no desire to use Linux and frankly don't give a rats patootie about
   it.  There are other, better, operating systems out there.  Like Mac, DOS,
   or Amiga-OS.  Or, better yet even, would be another free Unix OS like
   FreeBSD.
  '--': |-
   Unix sucks.  Because Linux = Unix.  Linux Sucks.  I worship Bill Gates.
  '---': |-
   I am Bill Gates.
  _: |-

 M:
  '': |-
   I use a Mac, but I'm pretty indifferent about it.
  '+': |-
   A Mac has it's uses and I use it quite often.
  '++': ! >-
   I am a Mac guru.  Anything those DOS putzes and unix nerds can do, I can do
   better, and if not, I'll write the damn software to do it.
  '-': |-
   Macs suck.  All real geeks have a character prompt.
  '--': ! >-
   Macs do more than suck.  They make a user stupid by allowing them to use the
   system without knowing what they are doing.  Mac weenies have lower IQs than
   the fuzz in my navel.
  _: |-

   Usenet News?  Sure, I read that once.
  '*': |-
   All I do is read news.
  '+': |-
   I read news recreationally when I have some time to kill.
  '++': |-
   I read all the news in a select handful of groups.
  '+++': ! >-
   I read so many news groups that the next batch of news comes in before I
   finish reading the last batch, and I have to read for about 2 hours straight
   before I'm caught up on the morning's news.  Then there's the afternoon...
  '++++': |-
   I am Tim Pierce.
  '-': |-
   News is a waste of my time and I avoid it completely.

   I am a Scientologist.
  _: |-

 O:
  '': |-
   I finally managed to get OS/2 installed but wasn't too terribly impressed.
  '++': ! >-
   I use OS/2 for all my computing needs.  I use some DOS and Windows programs,
   but rune them under OS/2.  If the program won't run under OS/2, then
   obviously I don't need it.
  '+++': ! >-
   I live, eat and breathe OS/2.  All of my hard drives are HPFS.  I am the
   Anti-Gates.
  '-': |-
   Tried it, didn't like it.
  '--': |-
   I can't even get the thing to install!
  '---': |-

   I know Perl exists, but that's all.
  '+': ! >-
   I know of perl.  I like perl.  I just haven't learned much perl, but it is
   on my agenda.
  '++': ! >-
   Perl is a powerful programming tool.  I don't write shell scripts anymore
   because I write them in Perl.
  '+++': ! >-
   Perl is a very powerful programming tool. Not only do I no longer write
   shell scripts,  I also no longer use awk or sed.  I use Perl for all
   programs of less than a thousand lines.
  '++++': ! >-
   I don't write Perl, I speak it.  Perl has superseded all other programming
   languages.  I firmly believe that all programs can be reduced to a Perl
   one-liner.  I use Perl to achieve U+++ status.
  '+++++': |-
   I am Larry Wall, Tom Christiansen, or Randal Schwartz.
  '-': |-
   What's Perl got that awk and sed don't have?
  '--': |-
   Perl users are sick, twisted programmers who are just showing off.
  '---': ! >-
   Perl combines the power of sh, the clarity of sed, and the performance of
   awk with the simplicity of C.  It should be banned.
  '?': |-
   What's Pearl?
  _: |-
   Perl
 PE:
  '': |-
   Distrust both government and business.
  '+': |-
   Balance the budget with spending cuts and an amendment.
  '++': ! >-
   Keep the government off the backs of businesses.  Deregulate as much as
   possible.
  '+++': ! >-
   Abolish antitrust legislation.  Raise taxes on everyone but the rich so that
   the money can trickle-down to the masses.
  '-': ! >-
   It's ok to increase government spending, so we can help more poor people. 
   Tax the rich!  Cut the defense budget!
  '--': ! >-
   Capitalism is evil!  Government should provide the services we really need. 
   Nobody should be rich.

   I've used it, but stopped long ago.
  '++': |-
   I have the most recent version and use it regularly.
  '+++': ! >-
   I don't send or answer mail that is not encrypted, or at the very least
   signed.  If you are reading this without decrypting it first, something is
   wrong.  IT DIDN'T COME FROM ME!
  '++++': |-
   I am Philip Zimmerman.
  '-': |-
   I don't have anything to hide.
  '--': ! >-
   I feel that the glory of the Internet is in the anarchic, trusting
   environment that so nurtures the exchange of information.  Encryption just
   bogs that down.
  '---': ! >-
   If you support encryption on the Internet, you must be a drug dealer or
   terrorist or something like that.
  '----': ! >-
   Oh, here's is something you all can use that is better (insert Clipper
   here).

 PS:
  '': |-
   I really don't have an opinion; nobody's messing with my freedoms right now.
  '+': ! >-
   My whole concept of liberalism is that nobody has the right to tell anybody
   else what to do, on either side of the political fence.  If you don't like
   it, turn the bloody channel.
  '++': ! >-
   I give to liberal causes.  I march for gay rights.  I'm a card carrying
   member of the ACLU.  Keep abortion safe and legal.
  '+++': |-
   Legalize drugs!  Abolish the government.  Fuck the draft!
  '-': |-
   Label records!  Keep dirty stuff off the TV and the Internet.
  '--': ! >-
   Oppose sex education, abortion rights, gay rights.  Rush Limbaugh is my
   spokesman.
  '---': ! >-
   Repent left-wing sinners and change your wicked evil ways.

   Role-Playing?  That's just something to do to kill a Saturday afternoon.

   I thought life WAS role-playing?
  '+': ! >-
   I've got my weekly sessions set up and a character that I know better than I
   know myself.
  '++': ! >-
   There is no life outside the role of the die.  I know all of the piddly
   rules of (chosen game).  _MY_ own warped rules scare the rest of the
   players.
  '+++': |-
   I've written and published my own gaming materials.

   I've get the entire admin ticked off at me because I am always using all of
   the CPU time and trying to run programs that I don't have access to.  I'm
   going to try cracking /etc/passwd next week, just don't tell anyone.
  '+++': ! >-
   I don't need to crack /etc/passwd because I just modified su so that it
   doesn't prompt me.  The admin staff doesn't even know I'm here.  If you
   don't understand what I just said, this category does NOT apply to you!

  '+': |-

  '++': ! >-
   Unix is a passing fad compared to the real power in the universe, my VMS
   system.
  '+++': ! >-
   I am a VMS sysadmin.  I wield far more power than those UNIX admins, because
   UNIX can be found on any dweeb's desktop.  Power through obscurity is my
   motto.
  '-': |-
   Unix is much better than VMS for my computing needs.
  '--': ! >-
   I would rather smash my head repeatedly into a brick wall than suffer the
   agony of working with VMS.  It's reminiscent of a dead and decaying pile of
   moose droppings.  Unix rules the universe.

  '++': ! >-
   I have a homepage.  I surf daily.  My homepage is advertised in my
   .signature.
  '+++': ! >-
   I am a WebMaster.  Don't even think about trying to view my homepage without
   the latest version of Netscape.  When I'm not on my normal net connection, I
   surf the web using my Newton and a cellular modem.
  '-': ! >-
   The web is really a pain.  Life was so much easier when you could transfer
   information by simple ASCII.  Now everyone won't even consider your ideas
   unless you spiff them up with bandwidth-consuming pictures and pointless
   information links.
  '--': ! >-
   A pox on the Web!  It wastes time and bandwidth and just gives the
   uneducated morons a reason to clutter the Internet.

   I've Converted my family and watch the show when I remember.  It's really

   This is one of the better shows I've seen.  I wish I'd taped everything from
   the start at SP, because I'm wearing out my EP tapes.  I'll periodically
   debate online.  I've Converted at least 5 people.  I've gotten a YAXA.
  '+++': >-
   This is the BEST show on TV, and it's about time.  I've seen everything
   David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson have ever done that been recorded and
   I'm a loyal Duchovny/ Gillian Anderson fan.  I've Converted at least 10

   I am on the cypherpunks mailing list and active around Usenet.  I never miss
   an opportunity to talk about the evils of Clipper and ITAR and the NSA. 
   Orwell's 1984 is more than a story, it is a warning to our's and future
   generations.  I'm a member of the EFF.
  '+++': |-
   I am T.C. May
  '-': >-
   It seems to me that all of these concerns are a little extreme.  I mean, the
   government must be able to protect itself from criminals and the populace
   from indecent speech. 
  '--': ! >-
   Get a life.  The only people that need this kind of protection are people

   It's just another TV show.
  '+': ! >-
   It's a damn fine TV show and is one of the only things good on television
   any more.
  '++': ! >-
   It's the best show around.  I have all the episodes and the movies on tape
   and can quote entire scenes verbatim.  I've built a few of the model kits
   too.  But you'll never catch me at one of those conventions.  Those people
   are kooks.
  '+++': ! >-
   It's not just a TV show, it's a religion.  I know all about warp field
   dynamics and the principles behind the transporter.  I have memorized the
   TECH manual.  I speak Klingon.  I go to cons with Vulcan ears on.  I have no
   life.

   Maybe it is just me, but I have no idea what the big deal with Star Trek is.
    Perhaps I'm missing something but I just think it is bad drama.
  '--': ! >-
   Star Trek is just another Space Opera.  William Shatner isn't an actor, he's
   a poser!  And what's with this Jean-Luc Picard?  A Frenchman with a British
   accent?  Come on.  I'd only watch this show if my remote control broke. 
   Isn't Voyager just a rehash of Lost in Space?  Has Sisko even breathed in
   the last two seasons?

   Star Trek SUCKS!  It is the worst crap I have ever seen! Hey, all you

   Ok, so I use MS Windows, I don't have to like it.
  '+': ! >-
   I have installed my own custom sounds, wallpaper, and screen savers so my PC
   walks and talks like a fun house.  Oh yeah, I have a hundred TrueType(tm)
   fonts that I've installed but never used.  I never lose Minesweeper and
   Solitaire
  '++': ! >-
   I write MS Windows programs in C and think about using C++ someday.  I've
   written at least one DLL.
  '+++': ! >-
   I am a MS Windows programming god.  I wrote a VxD driver to allow MS Windows
   and DOS to share the use of my waffle iron.  P.S.  Unix sux.

   I have Windows, Windows 95, Windows NT, and Windows NT Advanced Server all
   running on my SMP RISC machine.  I haven't seen daylight in six months.
  '+++++': |-
   I am Bill Gates
  '-': ! >-
   I'm still trying to install MS Windows and have at least one peripheral that
   never works right
  '--': ! >-
   MS Windows is a joke operating system.  Hell, it's not even an operating
   system.  NT is Not Tough enough for me either.  95 is how may times it will
   crash an hour.
  '---': ! >-
   Windows has set back the computing industry by at least 10 years.  Bill
   Gates should be drawn, quartered, hung, shot, poisoned, disembowelled, and
   then REALLY hurt.
