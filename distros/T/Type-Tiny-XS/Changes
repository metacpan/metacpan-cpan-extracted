   the Int check to think the non-integer was an integer.

0.014	2018-05-20

0.010	2014-07-22

 [ Bug Fixes ]
 - Type constraint subs can now be called with no parameters and will
   pretend that you passed them undef. This makes them behave more like
   Type::Tiny's PP implementation, where there are no argument count
   checks.

0.009	2014-07-22

 [ Bug Fixes ]

   compliance. Should compile now in MSVC.
