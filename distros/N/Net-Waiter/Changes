Revision history for Perl extension Net::Waiter

1.18  2025-01-31

    1. fixed allocation and release of nested shared memory segments 
       for nested hash structures. this is not documented in IPC::Shareable.
       if forked processes access shared hash and create nested hashref, it 
       will create new shared memory segment with different owner and will
       not be released by the parent process. so here it is preinitialised
       explicitly.
       
    2. forked and preforked processes will also explicitly attach to existing
       shared memory, expected to be created by the parnet process in advance.   

1.17  2025-01-25

    1. added stop_all_kids() and optimizing restart and shutdown logic.

1.16  2025-01-25

    1. reinstalls shared memory and forked processes state if cannot lock
       shared memory for 4 seconds. should not happen but sometimes external
       agent may remove semaphores or shared memory segments... sadly happens.
    2. added on_server_begin() hook.   

1.15  2024-09-11

    1. removed Time::HiRes dependency
    2. wait for child processes to finish before removing shared memory
    3. some debug messages removed
    4. bring back rtmin rtmax busy idle signals

1.14  2024-09-08

    1. fixed bug with shared memory locking logic
    2. added more run-time stats
    3. added log() and log_debug()
    4. initial statistics, will be used for autotuning in the future

1.13  2024-07-02

    1. changed child CHLD signal default to IGNORE. whoever wants to fork 
       further, should reinstall signal handler.

1.12  2024-03-23

    1. added default SIGHUP handler
        
        fired in parent processes:
            on_sig_hup()
        
        fired in child processes:    
            on_child_sig_hup()
    

1.11  2023.12.08

    1. fixed shared mem, semaphores, signalling issues
    2. sig child pid cleanup moved to central loop
    3. main stats for processes is moved to main loop also

1.10  2023.11.25

    1. added get_kids_pids()
    2. added propagate_signal()
    3. added separate signal USR1/2 handlers for parent/child processes. see:
        
        on_sig_usr1()
        on_sig_usr2()
        on_child_sig_usr1()
        on_child_sig_usr2()

1.09  2023.11.21

    1. fixed busyloop
    2. added timeout options

1.08  2023.10.04

    1. changed accept socket to non-blocking
    2. expanded shared memory to 1MiB (TODO: should be an option)
    3. removed extra debug messages

1.07  2023.10.02

    1. default Timeout for accept() is set to 4 seconds
    2. return non-error when prefork child accept() fails

1.06  2023.09.22

    1. added on_child_exit() handler. code cleanup.

1.05  2023.04.05

    1. prefork logic tuning, helper functions, cleanup

    1. PREFORK mode implemented
    2. MAXFORK count limit implemented
    
1.03  -- never released

    1. PREFORK implementation testing
