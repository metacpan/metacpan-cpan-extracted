#  PODNAME: pdoc
# ABSTRACT: typeset pandoc documents with document-specific, default options

# pdoc
#
# What this script does:
# 1. Get the first argument passed to it
# 2. Slurp that file and leave @ARGV intact
# 3. Grep all lines "<!--+ (--some-pandoc-option) +-->" from that file
# 4. Grep all lines "<!--& (some post processing action) &-->" from that file
# 5. join them into a command to be executed:
#    a) if there are commands to be executed, attach them with &&'s
#    b) else, don't.
# 6. Send that command off to the shell


# What to do with your pandoc files
# ---------------------------------
# Sprinkle <!--+ --pandoc-option1 --pandoc--option2 +--> all over your file
# as your would use them on the shell
#
# If you want your file to be typeset using those options, run
#     pdoc file.pandoc
#
# If you want standard processing of that file, run pandoc as usual:
#     pandoc file.pandoc

$_    = do{ local(@ARGV => $/) = $ARGV[0]; <> };            # Slurp the file

=head1 NAME

pdoc - typeset pandoc documents with document-specific, default options

=head1 VERSION

version 0.900

=head1 SYNOPSIS

This is just a small executable and a hack to pandoc:
you can use it to set document-specific, default options for pandoc
in the typesetting process.
Of course, you can safely ignore these settings and return to the standard way of doing things at all times.

=head1 USAGE

Usage is absolutely straight-forward:

=head2 Usage on the commandline

If you want your file to be typeset using the document-specific default options, run

     pdoc file.pandoc

If you want standard processing of that file, simply run pandoc as usual:

     pandoc file.pandoc

=head2 Setting document-specific options

=head3 Setting options

Sprinkle C<<< <!--+ --pandoc-option1 --pandoc--option2 +--> >>> all over your pandoc file -- just as your would use them on the shell.
C<<< pdoc >>> will read these and add them to the commandline that is passed to a standard pandoc typesetting.

=head3 Defining post-processing behavior

Use C<<< <!--& (some post processing action) &--> >>> as the special markup to C<<< pdoc >>> for post-processing options. These will be concatenated to the pandoc-commandline that is generated via C<<< && >>>, just like so:

     % pandoc --option1 --option2 && your-command-1 && your-command2

=head1 INTERNAL WORKINGS

This is just a simple hack reading out specially marked comments in your pandoc source. Everything will stay usable as always. When typesetting in the standard manner, these comments are simply ignored.

See the executable for the details.

=head1 EXTRAS

=head2 Shell variables

You can use shell variables as usual, e.g. C<<< $HOME >>>, etc.

=head2 Use policies

When doing more complicatd things (see example below) I like to use so-called I<pandoc-policies> (as I call them).

I keep a folder C<<< ~/.pandoc/policies >>> next to C<<< ~/.pandoc/templates >>> containing files like C<<< ~/.pandoc/policies/columns.latex >>> (handling column-layouts) C<<< ~/.pandoc/policies/squeeze.latex >>> (for whitespace squeezing), and so on...

All of these policies are to be included by C<<< pandoc >>>'s C<<< -H / --include-in-header= >>>-switch, so it makes:

     % pandoc -H $HOME/.pandoc/policies/squeeze.latex -o document.{pdf,pandoc}

=head1 EXAMPLE

Suppose you have a squeeze and a columns-policy in your policy-folder, your document might look like this:

     % John Doe
     % Interesting topic
     % 01/01/2013
 
     <!--+ 
         --include-in-header=$HOME/.pandoc/policies/squeeze.latex
         --include-in-header=$HOME/.pandoc/policies/columns.latex
      +-->
 
     # Regular pandoc/markdown Heading 1
 
     * A list
     * of things
     * etc.

=head2 Extended example using post-processing options

Here is a somewhat more complicated example: the cheat-sheet generator that I'm currently using while learning for my final examination:

     % Parsing -- Summary
     % Daniel B.
     % Oct/Nov 2012
 
     <!-- Default options                                               -->
     <!-- ===============                                               -->
     <!--+ -H $HOME/.pandoc/templates/policies/{squeeze,columns}.latex +-->
     <!--+ -sSN --toc                                                  +-->
     <!--+ -Vfontsize:8pt,a4paper,twocolumn,landscape                  +-->
     <!--+ -o parsing.pdf                                              +-->
 
     <!-- Unused options (regular comments)                             -->
     <!-- =================================                             -->
     <!-- -H $HOME/.pandoc/templates/policies/columns.latex            +-->
     <!-- -H $HOME/.pandoc/templates/policies/chapterstyle.latex       +-->
     <!-- -H $HOME/.pandoc/templates/policies/numbering.latex          +-->
 
     <!-- Post-typeset exec                                             -->
     <!-- =================                                             -->
     <!--& pdfnup --nup 1x2 --no-landscape parsing.pdf --outfile parsing.pdf  &-->
     <!--& open parsing.pdf                                                   &-->
 
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
     # Part I: Basics
     ## Chapter 1: What exactly is Parsing?
     Text goes here....

This cheat-sheet generator can simply be called using C<<< pdoc cheatsheet.pandoc >>> and will additionally use pdfjam to squeeze even more of the resulting pdf pages together. On a Mac, it will additionally open the file after the final pdfjam rendering for quality inspection ;-).

=head3 Things to note

=over

=item *

Note how several policies are grouped together on shell level, using curly-bracket expansion: 

=back

     -H $HOME/.pandoc/templates/policies/{squeeze,columns}.latex

=over

=item *

Also note, how additional options are set via C<<< pandoc >>>'s C<<< -V >>>-switch, and how even more options are smuggled in into C<<< pandoc >>>'s own latex template. (The latter you can find using C<<< pandoc -D latex >>>) in using

=back

     -Vfontsize:8pt,a4paper,twocolumn,landscape
