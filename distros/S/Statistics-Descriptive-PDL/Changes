Revision history for Statistics-Descriptive-PDL

0.17    2024-07-02
        - Add sum_sqr_weights and sum_sqr_sample_weights methods to
          obtain the sum of squared weights.
        - All objects now support sum_weights and methods for convenience.

0.16    2022-04-25
        - SampleWeighted:
          - Return undef for skewness and kurtosis
            when insufficient samples to apply correction.
        - Avoid method call on scalar in weighted geometric mean

0.15    2022-04-24
        - Fix weighted geometric_mean for larger data samples
          (but properly this time and with a better test)

0.14    2022-04-24
        - Fix weighted geometric_mean for larger data samples

0.13    2022-01-31
        - Remove niceslice syntax to avoid possible parsing issues.

0.12    2021-09-14
        - Fix issue with Weighted::get_data_as_hash
          We weren't updating the data ndarray after deduping,
          so the weights (hash values) were all out of kilter.

0.11    2021-09-13
        - fix an egregious error in SampleWeighted percentile method

0.10    2021-09-13
        - add get_data and get_data_as_hash methods

0.09    2021-09-13
        - Add values_are_unique method to allow the user to flag
          (or check) that the values are unique.  This can be used
          to speed up percentile and median calcs.
          Caveat emptor if the data are not unique, obviously.

0.08    2021-09-12
        - Cache all integer percentiles
        - Add percentiles method to get multiple values.
          This is simply a wrapper around the percentile method
        - Add sd and stdev as aliases of standard_deviation

0.07    2021-09-06
        - Another attempt to fix precision related test failures

0.06    2021-09-06
        - Track down more sclr calls to work on PDL earlier than 2.056

0.05    2021-09-05
        - Missed one test failure in 0.04.

0.04    2021-09-05
        - Fix several CPAN test failures.  Thanks to SREZIC for reporting.

0.03    2021-09-05
        - Add repo info to Makefile.PL

0.02    2021-09-05
        - Finally get back to it.

0.01    2015-07-19
        - First version.
