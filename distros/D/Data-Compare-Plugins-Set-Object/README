NAME

    Data::Compare::Plugins::Set::Object - plugin for Data::Compare to
    handle Set::Object objects

VERSION

    version 1.002

SYNOPSIS

        use 5.010;
        use Set::Object 'set';
        use Data::Compare;
    
        my $foo = {
            list => [ qw(one two three) ],
            set  => set( [1], [2], [3] ),
        };
        my $bar = {
            list => [ qw(one two three) ],
            set  => set( [1], [2], [3] ),
        };
    
        say 'Sets in $foo and $bar are ',
            $foo->{set} == $bar->{set} ? '' : 'NOT ', 'identical.';
        say 'Data within $foo and $bar are ',
            Compare($foo, $bar) ? '' : 'NOT ', 'equal.';

DESCRIPTION

    Enables Data::Compare to Do The Right Thing for Set::Object objects.
    Set::Object already has an equals() method, but it only returns true if
    objects within two sets are exactly equal (i.e. have the same
    references, referring to the same object instance). When using
    Data::Compare in conjunction with this plugin, objects in sets are
    considered the same if their contents are the same. This extends down
    to sets that contain arrays, hashes, or other objects supported by
    Data::Compare plugins.

SUBROUTINES/METHODS

    As a plugin to Data::Compare, the interface is the same as
    Data::Compare itself: pass the reference to two data structures to the
    Compare function, which for historical reasons is exported by default.

    Set::Object also can export certain functions, and overloads comparison
    operators pertaining to sets. Consult the Set::Object documentation for
    more information.
