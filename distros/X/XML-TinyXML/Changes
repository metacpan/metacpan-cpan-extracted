Revision history for Perl extension TinyXML.

0.34  - The API is now 0-based (when dealing with arrays)
      - fixed a bug in the parser triggered by extra spaces in start tags
0.33  - allow to build even if iconv is missing. In which case encoding conversion functionalities will be disabled
0.32  - fixed the 'Free to wrong pool' bug showing on multi-threaded perl when running on win32
      - cleanings to suppress compiler warnings
      - fixed compilation on some windows systems complaining about W32LockFile/W32UnlockFile redefinition
      - fixed pod documentation for XML::TinyXML::Selector::XPath
      - enforced 'use strict' and 'use warnings' on all perl modules
0.31  - fixed a bug which caused the xpath selector to potentially return items 
        in a random order when expanding a predicate (instead of returning them 
        in the order of appearance in the document)
0.30  - fixed an infinite loop introduced when adding the 'ignoreWhiteSpaces' flag
      - expose a new accessor to directly construct an xml object from a file
0.29  - reimplementing strcasestr() since it's not portable
        (missing on solaris)
      - fixed POD errors, warnings, formatting and a few doc typos
0.28  - fixed testunits : added missing files to MANIFEST
0.27  - fixed a namespace-related bug + minor cleanings
0.26  - introduced 'ignoreBlanks' and 'ignoreWhiteSpaces' flags
        (which affect both parsing and dumping behaviours)
0.25  - reimplemented XmlDumpBranch optimizations through safer code
0.24  - reverted XmlDumpBranch optimizations becuase 
        memory corruption was caused by the new code
0.23  - fixed a bug in hash-import routines
        (0-values produced empty xml nodes)
0.22  - introducing support for namespaces
      - optimizations in the underlying C library
0.21  - fixed a serious memory leak in the XS wrapper to XmlDump()
      - updated more documentation
0.20  - fixed a bug in Makefile.PL which was preventing it from being
        properly built as port on freebsd
0.19  - fixed MANIFEST to include encoding testunits
      - setting doConversion when necessary also for generated documents
        and not only when dumping an imported (and possibly modified) document
      - documentation
0.18  - fixed (hopefully) build on solaris
0.17  - support encodings through iconv
0.16  - bugfix in expression-parsing logic 
        (used to parse nested boolean expressions within predicates)
0.15  - full xpath support
      - introducing XML::TinyXML::NodeAttribute API 
        (as wrapper to the XmlNodeAttribute C structure)
      - better testunits 
0.14  - preliminary xpath (unabbreviated-only) implementation
0.13  - switched to macro-based linklist implementation 
0.12  - small improvements to the API (no changes...only extensions)
      - more testunits (and started rearranging them in multiple files)
      - by default, on export, empty nodes will use the shorter <node/> notation
        (this should be made optionally deactivable through some flag,
         as for defining encoding, whitespace handling and any other 
         optional behaviour which makes sense to take into account when 
         exporting)
0.11  - fixed leaks in underlying XmlGetNode() and XmlSetNodePath()
      - safety belt in XmlDumpBranch() to avoid accessing invalid memory
        in some edge cases
0.10  - forcing prerequisite for perl >= 5.8
      - introducing XmlGetAttributeByName() in the underlying C implementation
      - fixed direct dumping on a file: XmlSave() dumped on a file only if it
        already existed (blindly trying to create a backup copy). It now 
        creates the file if not there (and backup it if already present)
0.09  - bugfix : xmlize() MUST ensure to null-terminate the escaped string
        if the buffer had to be realloc'd
0.08  - bugfix : dexml() now works properly so special characters are now
        handled correctly when importing xml data
      - testunits now include escaping/unescaping-related checks
0.07  - correctly handle escaping/unescaping of xml special chars on 
        import/export operations
0.06  - bugfix: typo in XML::TinyXML::Node.pm:109
0.05  - updated documentation and implemented XML::TinyXML::addChildNode()
0.04  - allow the module to be built and used by perl interpreters < 5.8.8
      - some more documentation regarding the XML::TinyXML::Node object
0.03  - make the module to build properly on windows
        (strtok_r doesn't exist on win32)
      - added some documentation (more is still needed)
0.02  - switching from flock to ftrylockfile/funlockfile 
        to ensure solaris compatibility
