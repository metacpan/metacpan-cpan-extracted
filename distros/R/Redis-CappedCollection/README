Redis::CappedCollection package version 1.10
============================================

Redis::CappedCollection module provides fixed sized collections that have
an auto-FIFO age-out feature. Collection size is determined by Redis server
'maxmemory' setting.

The Redis::CappedCollection package was written, tested, and found working on
recent Linux distributions.

INSTALLATION

To install this package type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

Perl version 5.010 or better is needed in order to install and use this package.
The Redis::CappedCollection module depends on other packages that are distributed
separately from Perl. We recommend that you have the following packages installed
before you install Redis::CappedCollection :

   Const::Fast
   Digest::SHA1
   Mouse
   Params::Util
   Redis
   Try::Tiny

The Redis::CappedCollection module has the following optional dependencies:

   Data::UUID
   JSON::XS
   Net::EmptyPort
   Sys::SigAction
   Test::Exception
   Test::NoWarnings
   Test::RedisServer

If the optional modules are missing, some "prereq" tests are skipped.

The installation of the missing dependencies can be accomplished either
through your OS package manager or through CPAN (or downloading the source
for all dependencies and compiling them manually).

TESTING

A running Redis server is required before launching tests.

We strongly recommend setting 'maxmemory' option in the redis.conf file.

TODO

Implement tests for
- memory errors handling (working with internal ROLLBACK commands).
- working with maxmemory = 0 in the redis.conf file.
