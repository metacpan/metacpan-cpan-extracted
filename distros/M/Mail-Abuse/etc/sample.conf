# This file contains a sample config file for the acompanying software.
#
# Please be sure to read through it and modify according to your
# specific needs. This is specially true since this file might
# contain nonsense, as its purpose is to document each and every

##
# These are the flags for the POP3 reader
##

# The following ones are actually easy to figure out.
pop3 server: pop.yourdomain.com
pop3 username: abuse
pop3 password: Sp@mH@73r

# If you want the reader to delete each fetched message, set
# this one to a true value. Otherwise comment it or set it to
# a false value
pop3 delete: 1

# Uncomment the next line to produce a lot of debugging messages
# pop3 debug: 1

##
# These are the flags for the Google(tm) Groups reader
##

# A regexp to look for in the NANAS articles. Articles that match are
# considered as reports.
google groups search: usually.your.organization.top.level.domain

# Which server to connect to. Defaults ro groups.google.com.
google groups server: groups.google.com

# If your organization requires a proxy server, say so below
google groups proxy: your.proxy.server

# How much time to look back in history. Only matching articles that are
# this age or younger will be considered.
google groups oldest message: 5 days ago

# If you need debug info, toggle this
google groups debug: 0

# Limit in the number of articles to consider. Only this number of 
# articles will be returned. You should tune this to suit your 
# organization. If this number is set too high, you might crawl the
# whole Google(tm) archive, which does not seem like a bright idea, so set
# this to a rather small number.
google groups max messages: 3

##
# These flags control the Log incident parser
##

# When trying to parse generic logs, you can tell the module to look
# at a non-default number of contiguous lines. The default is 5.
log lines: 3

# You can also set debugging for the Log parser
# log debug: 1

##
# These flags control the Received: header parser
##

# Sets the debug output for the Received: header parser
# debug received: 1

##
# These are the flags for the Time filter
##

# Use this to configure the point in time before which you will not
# consider an incident. If left unspecified, the module will assume
# that you do not care about incidents after 96 hours have elapsed.
filter before: 96 hours ago

# This can be used to specify a default timestamp to use when
# interpreting dates. It defaults to UTC
filter local timezone: UTC

# If you want to see some debug messages, uncomment the line below
# debug time filter: 1

##
# These flags control the IP filter
##

# The line below specifies the address range for which you're
# responsable. It should always be specified in order to ignore
# incidents for which you most likely care very little. See
# NetAddr::IP for the formats you can use to specify a subnet.
source ip within: 10.0.0.0/24, 10.0.1.0/24

# Sometimes, your address space is not easily described with a
# contiguous netblock. For these cases, you can use the following line
# to add "holes" to the space you care about.
source ip outside: 10.0.0.0/27

##
# These flags control the Store processor, which you can use to
# convert a report into an intermediate structure that hopefully, can
# be used by other utilities
##

# You can specify where to store the tree with the serialized reports
# by setting the value for the following key. Commenting it, you 
# default to the current directory, which may or may not be a good 
# idea...
store root path: /var/spool/spam-reports

# As customary, this module can output some debugging information
# depending on the value of the following key...
# debug store: 1

##
# These flags control the Mailer processor, which can provide an
# auto-answer to the affected users regarding their report.
##

# The customary debug flag. You should be already familiar with it.
#debug mailer: 1

# The mailer type used to send email. Please see Mail::Mailer for the
# accepted values for this flag. This defaults to "mail", which uses
# a local command in your system for delivery. This is probably the most
# reliable mode of operation on *nix hosts, as mail will be queued by the
# mail system in case of error.
mailer type: mail

# The from address to include in the headers. Now, this might not work on
# your email configuration if the MTA or MUA changes it. This argument is
# mandatory. Here, we produce a sensible default.
mailer from: abuse

# The address that should be used by recipients of the receipt to reply.
# We use this default so as to discourage replying, as your auto-response
# should be detailed enough so as to not require further explanations :)
mailer reply to: please-do-not-reply-to-this

# The address that will be collecting the delivery errors associated with
# the receipts produced by this module. Depending on your workload, this
# might be a real account or a bit bucket. We chose the later.
mailer errors to: nobody

# For testing purposes, you could force ::Mailer to always send the
# response to a given address, such as in this example.
mailer forced to: testme@my.own.domain

# The subject to place in your responses
mailer subject: Your funky subject line

# This contains the name of a file to use as a template response whenever
# the abuse report does not end up with any incidents. This should contain
# an absolute path to a file, but we specify it here like this, to give you
# a hint about where to look at for a template.
mailer fail message: etc/fail.template

# Conversely, this contains the name of the message template to use when
# the abuse report can be properly analyzed and ends up with at least,
# one incident.
mailer success message: etc/success.template

##
# These flags control the Score processor, which can help priorize
# your incident-response processes by assigning scores to the abuse
# reports. Those scores can be used later to trim out "noise" reports.
##

# The customary debug flag. You should be already familiar with it.
#debug score: 1

# In this example, we use the incident scoring method to assign more
# weight to SpamCop/MyNetWatchman abuse reports.
score incident type: 2 ^(spam/SpamCop|mynetwatchman/)

# Here, since we know of a user that submits fake abuse reports, we
# will be getting rid of this...
score report text: -99999999 ^From:\s+Some\sSaboteur

## ...and ends here.
