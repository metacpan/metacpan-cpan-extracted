NAME
    Parse::CPAN::Perms - Parse 06perms.txt.gz

VERSION
    version 0.004

SYNOPSIS
      # Construction
      my $perms = Parse::CPAN::Perms->new('path/to/06perms.txt.gz');

      # Get all perms data as hash ref
      my $perms_data = $perms->perms;

      # Boolean convenience method
      $perms->is_authorized(AUTHOR => 'Package::Name');

DESCRIPTION
    !! THIS MODULE IS EXPERIMENTAL. INTERFACE IS SUBJECT TO CHANGE !!

    This module parses the 06perms.txt.gz file from a CPAN-like repository.
    At this time, it only parses the compressed form and it provides no
    mechanism for adding new permissions or writing the data back out to a
    file. If you desire those features, please contact the author.

CONSTRUCTOR
    new('path/to/06perms.txt.gz')
    new(parmsfile => 'path/to/06perms.txt.gz')
        Constructs a new instance of Parse::CPAN::Perms from the specified
        perms file. The file must exist and must be readable.

  METHODS
    perms()
        Returns all the permission data as a hash reference

    is_authorized(AUTHOR => 'Package::Name')
        Returns true if the author has permission for the package

    refresh( $force )
        Causes the permisions hash to be cleared if the "permsfile" has
        changed since the last time it was read. The permissions hash will
        be lazily re-read from disk the next time it is needed. If $force is
        true, then the permissions hash is cleared unconditionally.

SEE ALSO
    CPAN::Repository::Perms serves a similar purpose, but is a much more
    robust module. However, it is bundled with several other CPAN-related
    modules which may or may not fit your needs and desires.
