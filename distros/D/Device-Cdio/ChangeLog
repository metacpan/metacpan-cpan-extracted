	* .cvsignore, META.yml: META.yml is derived when making the
	  distribution.

2006-03-02 Thursday 16:32  Rocky Bernstein <rocky@cpan.org>

	  of perl can't handle the numeric comaprison for reasons I don't
	  know or want to find out why.

2006-03-02 Thursday 03:55  Rocky Bernstein <rocky@cpan.org>

	  Lots of changes to get IFS and FS working well enough for the
	  sample programs iso2.pl and iso3.pl.

	  We now return an singleton iso9660stat_t

	  returning data from ISO 9660 reads works.

	  Removed open and close from @EXPORTS (is in @EXPORTS_OK) as that
	  was getting confused with builtin open()/close().

2006-03-01 Wednesday 21:40  Rocky Bernstein <rocky@cpan.org>

	* .cvsignore: .cvsignore add iso9660 c's and .o's

2006-03-01 Wednesday 21:39  Rocky Bernstein <rocky@cpan.org>

	  experience with perlcdio9660.swg.

2006-02-28 Tuesday 12:42  Rocky Bernstein <rocky@cpan.org>

	* lib/Device/Cdio/ISO9660/FS.pm: FS class is a subclass of
	  Cdio::Device for working with ISO9660 tracks.

	* lib/Device/Cdio/ISO9660/IFS.pm: Missing a method doc.

	* MANIFEST, perliso9660.swg, read.swg, types.swg,
	  lib/Device/Cdio/ISO9660/IFS.pm: More towards getting ISO 9660
	  working. A number of routines added.	read.swg: was not freeing a
	  char * return object.

2006-02-25 Saturday 22:19  Rocky Bernstein <rocky@cpan.org>

	* Build.PL, device.swg, perliso9660.swg, types.swg, t/07.iso.t:
	  More work on getting ISO 9660 more compilete.

2006-02-25 Saturday 06:03  Rocky Bernstein <rocky@cpan.org>

	* Build.PL, MANIFEST, perliso9660.swg, types.swg, t/07.iso.t: Looks
	  like ISO9660 access for Perl (via libiso9660) will be a reality!

2006-02-24 Friday 23:16  Rocky Bernstein <rocky@cpan.org>

	* Build.PL, MANIFEST, META.yml, device.swg, lib/Device/Cdio.pm:
	  Version number need to change for CPAN.  Build.PL: a little

	  to Track Util.pm: set version number same as Device::Cdio

2006-02-13 Monday 02:20  Rocky Bernstein <rocky@cpan.org>

	* Build.PL, Changes, MANIFEST, MANIFEST.SKIP, META.yml, device.swg,
	  lib/Device/Cdio.pm, lib/Device/Cdio/Device.pm,
	  lib/Device/Cdio/Track.pm, t/06.bincue.t: Build.PL: we no longer
	  require SWIG to be installed. We'll use our own perlcdio_wrap.c
	  if not.

	  device.swg: guard against using a libcdio's get_hwinfo which can
	  store outside of the array. It's only a problem in theory as
	  release revision numbers are not more than 4 bytes long and the
	  current CVS (where the revsion number is 7 bytes long, e.g
	  0.77cvs) now truncates.

	  *.pm: Synchronize version numbers.

	  Device.pm: a more useful get_device routine.

2006-02-12 Sunday 09:36  Rocky Bernstein <rocky@cpan.org>

	* t/.gdb_history: Tolerate gdb debugging

2006-02-12 Sunday 09:32  Rocky Bernstein <rocky@cpan.org>

	  code.

2006-02-12 Sunday 05:04  Rocky Bernstein <rocky@cpan.org>

	* device.swg: get_hw_info() change for Darwin. Don't know why, but
	  static's inside of routine was causing memory to get clobbered.
	  So moved it out.

	  in char ** returns we really need to check that we don't have
	  NULL.

	  One

2006-02-11 Saturday 10:20  Rocky Bernstein <rocky@cpan.org>

	* Build.PL, lib/Device/Cdio.pm, lib/Device/Cdio/Device.pm,
	  lib/Device/Cdio/Track.pm, lib/Device/Cdio/Util.pm: Allow Perl
	  5.8.6.

	* Build.PL, Changes, disc.swg, examples/tracks.pl,
	  lib/Device/Cdio/Device.pm, t/10.cdda.t: disc.swg, Device.pm,
	  10.cdda.t: Add get_mcn and regression test.  Changes: Note what

	  example programs to get run outside of unpacked directory (if
	  Cdio is installed).  Add ChangeLogs and code for making them.

2006-02-10 Friday 13:19  Rocky Bernstein <rocky@cpan.org>

	* device.swg, perlcdio.swg, types.swg: Move word size determination
	  from device.swg to types.swg. A better place for it.

	  perlcdio.swg: document more constants.

2006-02-10 Friday 13:07  Rocky Bernstein <rocky@cpan.org>

	  First cut at getting read routines working.  There may be a bug
	  in trying to return binary data. Just don't know how to do it in
	  Perl yet.
