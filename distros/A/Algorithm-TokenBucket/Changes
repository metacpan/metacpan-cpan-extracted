0.36  Sun Jun 23 12:20:54 MSK 2013
	- Increase some epsilons in tests to account for really slow test
	  boxes. No functional changes.

0.32  Tue Feb 19 18:22:38 MSK 2008
	- Restore 5.6 compatibility lost in 0.3.

0.31  Tue Feb 19 16:04:40 MSK 2008
	- Avoid token flow in _init() and state() to make cloning
	  reliable. This may break code which directly
	  interprets state() result or messes with object's
	  attributes. Such code deserves it.
	- Reach 100% cond coverage.
	- Also, use more cmp_ok's in test.pl to better diagnose cpantest FAILs.
