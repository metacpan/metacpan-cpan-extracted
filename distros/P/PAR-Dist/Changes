0.42  2009-01-03

- Apply *correct* patch for blib_to_par across file system boundaries

0.41  2008-12-17

- Apply patch for blib_to_par across file system boundaries from Radek.

0.40  2008-10-27

- Rewrite parts of the install_par docs.
- Add the esoteric auto_inst_lib_conversion parameter to install_par.

0.39  2008-10-21

- Add the "verbose" option to install_par and uninstall_par.
- Add the "uninstall_shadows" option to install_par.

0.38  2008-10-16

- Fix _check_tools() to use *Foo{THING} syntax instead of \&{}.

0.37  2008-10-08

- Fix the "Skip 03merge_meta tests if no A::Zip nor zip/unzip found." logic.
- Add more debug output to debug mode (system calls).
- Add internal _check_tools() sub which checks the availability of various
  required tools (yaml, zip).

0.36  2008-09-30

- Skip 03merge_meta tests if no YAML *DUMPER* could be found.
- Better debug output for the YAML-search.

- Make file://foo.par URLs installable.

0.28  2008-02-05

- Setting installation targets to undef with install_par
  should remove them altogether now. This way, you can
  make sure, some parts aren't installed. (Such as manpages
  on win32)

0.27  2008-02-04

- No more signature. I keep breaking things with it.

0.26  2008-02-03

- If the return code from LWP::Simple is 304/not modified,
  then that's a success. So we shouldn't throw an error.

- Use Archive::Unzip::Burst for unzipping if available.

0.24  2007-07-20

0.21  2006-10-12

- _install_or_uninstall tries to remove the temporary directory
  while cwd() is in that directory. That fails on win32 leaving
  temporary directories on disk. This is now fixed.

0.20  2006-10-11

- Added a more flexible way of using PAR::Dist::install_par's
  custom target logic.

0.19  2006-09-03

- It's not possible to specify your own installation paths.
- Installation paths now documented.

0.15  2006-07-28

- PAR::Dist would previously generate bad file names and META.yml if
  the newlines contained Windows' \r. That's history.

0.14  2006-07-19

- The "version" field of META.yml files written by Module::Build
  was not parsed correctly by the ad-hoc YAML parser.

0.13  2006-07-22

- Module::Install didn't regenerate META.yml because author bit
  wasn't set.

0.12  2006-07-21

- Found a couple of path-related bugs in the new functions of 0.11.

  a .par archive.

0.10  2006-07-05

- .par distributions fetched from URLs will now be installed as
  distributions named "Module-Name" instead of
  "http://foo.bar/path/Module-Name-0.01-architecture-version.par".
