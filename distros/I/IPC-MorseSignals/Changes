Revision history for IPC-MorseSignals

0.17    2017-07-23 21:10 UTC
        With this release, this module is formally deprecated. Don't expect any
        new release.
        + Doc : Document deprecation.
        + Doc : Fix miscellaneous nits.

0.16    2013-08-22 20:35 UTC
        This is a maintenance release. The code contains no functional change.
        Satisfied users of version 0.15 can skip this update.
        + Upd : Package metadata overhaul.
        + Tst : Author tests are no longer bundled with this distribution.
                They are only made available to authors in the git repository.

0.15    2008-04-05 00:00 UTC
        + Fix : Correct die error when SIGUSR{1,2} aren't found.
        + Fix : Strip off duplicated targets when sending to multiple processes
                at the same time.
        + Tst : Lower base speed to 1024 bauds when forking.
        + Tst : Don't reset the receiver state anymore, but always respawn.
        + Tst : t/70-speed.t tests are now marked as TODO, so that they won't
                block module installation.
        + Tst : Timeouts aren't truncated to 10 seconds anymore. This used to
                result into physically logical failures. On the other hand, if
                the required timeout now goes over 20 seconds, the test is
                considered failed.

0.14
        Phantom version, maybe released through CPAN for a short amount of time.

0.13    2008-03-10 15:25 UTC
        + Chg : Build prerequisites are now completely separated from run-time
                prerequisites.
        + Doc : The usual set of POD typos.
        + Tst : Changed SIGHUP handlers in the parent for SIGUSR1's.
        + Tst : Changed SIGHUP handlers in the child for SIGTSTP's.
        + Tst : Meaningful fork tests labels.
        + Tst : More synchronization barriers.
        + Tst : Safe kills.

0.12    2008-03-09 10:20 UTC
        + Doc : POD tweaks.
        + Fix : Correct Makefile.PL die messages.

0.11    2008-03-05 21:05 UTC
        + Doc : POD tweaks.
        + Fix : Bit::MorseSignals is a dependency now.
        + Tst : Reenable t/99-kwalitee.t.

0.10    2008-03-05 16:35 UTC
        IPC::MorseSignals now uses Bit::MorseSignals as backend. Major rewrite.

0.09    2008-02-03 18:25 UTC
        + Tst : Fix a race in child creation : the parent could send the message
                before the child was ready to receive it.
        + Tst : Turn autoflush on onto the reader end of the pipe.
        + Tst : Renamed IPCMTest to IPC::MorseSignals::TestSuite
        + Tst : Prefix author tests by 9*-.
        + Tst : New optional author test : 95-portability-files.t, that uses
                Test::Portability::Files when it's present.

0.08    2007-09-05 09:40 UTC
        + Chg : The sender detects now automatically if the message is encoded
                in UTF-8, thanks to Encode::is_utf8. You no longer need to pass
                the utf8 option to msend. The Encode module is a prerequisite.
        + Chg : Tests that used to die now report correct failure.
        + Fix : Tests are now strict.
        + Fix : Miscount in t/13-speed.t

0.07    2007-08-28 11:30 UTC
        + Chg : Common test code was factored into a module.
        + Chg : Tests were lightened again.
        + Doc : Typos in POD.

0.06    2007-08-21 08:15 UTC
        + Add : The protocol now carries the UTF-8 flag (hence you no longer
                need to specify it to mrecv()) and the sender's PID (but you can
                mask it).
        + Add : New functions : mreset(), mlastmsg(), mlastsender().
        + Chg : msend() accepts now the sign option, to specify is the sender
                can put its PID into the message packet or not (default is yes).
        + Chg : mrecv() now returns a hash reference that holds the receiver's
                state. %SIG has to be passed as the first argument. The callback
                is no longer mandatory and should be passed with the cb key. The
                utf8 key was removed.
        + Chg : The tests call fork() only one time.

0.05    2007-08-18 16:50 UTC
        + Add : m{send,recv} will croak() if any of their arguments is invalid.
        + Chg : The requirements to pass the speed test were lowered.
        + Doc : Typos in POD.
        + Fix : You can now send "0" as a valid message.
        + Fix : I lied, t/02-sigusr.t wasn't really gone.
        + Fix : while ($speed > 1) { $speed /= 2 } ok($speed >= 1); never fails.

0.04    2007-08-17 14:45 UTC
        + Add : Test for SUGUSR{1,2} in Makefile.PL.
        + Add : Unicode support. Enabled by passing utf8 => 1 to m{send,recv}.
        + Chg : The speed must now be passed to msend() by speed => $speed.
        + Chg : Tests no longer pass their result with pipes.
        + Doc : <apeiron> 'truely' isn't a word.
        + Fix : t/11-speed.t didn't fail properly (as if those tests don't fail
                enough yet!).
        + Fix : t/02-sigusr.t didn't check properly the returned value.

0.03    2007-08-16 16:20 UTC
        + Chg : Better t/10-base.t... Or at least, I hope so.

0.02    2007-08-16 15:55 UTC
        + Add : samples/bench.pl, a transfer speed benchmark script.
        + Add : New tests : t/02-sigusr.t, t/11-speed.t
        + Fix : Warnings when the transfer fails.
        + Doc : The protocol was documented.

0.01    2007-08-15 21:20 UTC
        First version, released on an unsuspecting world.
