Description

    Module::Provision is used to create a skeletal CPAN distribution,
    including basic builder scripts, tests, documentation, and module code.
    It creates a VCS repository and, with Git as the VCS, installs some
    hooks that mimic the RCS Revision keyword expansion

    On first use the directory ~/.module_provision is created and populated
    with templates and an index file index.json. The author name, id, and
    email are derived from the system (the environment variables AUTHOR and
    EMAIL take precedence). They can be overridden by the values in the
    configuration file ~/.module_provision/module_provision.json

    If the default builder (MB) is used, then the project file Build.PL
    loads inc::Bob which instantiates an inline subclass of Module::Build.
    The code for the subclass is in inc::SubClass. The file
    inc::CPANTesting allows for fine grained control over which tests are
    run by which CPAN Testing smokers

    The default builder used by the create distribution method can be
    changed from the command line or from the configuration file

    If the Git VCS is used precommit and commit-msg hooks are installed.
    The precommit hook will expand the RCS Revision keyword in files on the
    master branch if the file .distribution_name.rev exists in the parent
    of the working tree. The precommit hook will also update the version
    number and date/time stamp in the change log (Changes). The commit-msg
    hook will extract the first comment line from the change log and use it
    as the commit message header. The remainder of the commit message (if
    any) is used as the commit message body. This means that so long as one
    detail line is added to the change log no other commit message text is
    required. The following makes for a suitable git log alias:

       alias gl='git log -5 --pretty=format:"%h %ci %s" | \
          cut -d" " -f1-3,5- | cut -c1-79'

    The default VCS used by the create distribution methods can be changed
    from the command line or from the configuration file

    The templates contain comment lines like:

       # @(#)Ident: Provision.pm 2013-04-15 13:52 pjf ;

    These are expanded automatically by Emacs using this Lisp code:

       (setq time-stamp-active     t
             time-stamp-line-limit 10
             time-stamp-format     " %f %04y-%02m-%02d %02H:%02M %u "
             time-stamp-start      "Ident:"
             time-stamp-time-zone  "UTC"
             time-stamp-end        ";")

    The alias:

       alias ident='ack "@\(#\)"'

    uses the App::Ack program to implement the old SYSV R4 ident command

    The templates for the project files dist.ini, Build.PL, and Makefile.PL
    contain the following comments which are interpreted by Emacs:

       # Local Variables:
       # mode: perl
       # eval: (load-project-state "[% appdir %]")
       # tab-title: [% project %]
       # tab-width: 3
       # End:

    Perl mode is preferred over C-Perl mode since the former has better
    syntax highlighting. Tabs are expanded to three spaces. The tab-title
    variable is used by Yakuake::Sessions to set the tab title for the
    terminal emulator. The load-project-state Lisp looks like this:

       (defun load-project-state (state-file) "Recovers the TinyDesk state from file"
          (let ((session-path (concat "~/.emacs.d/config/state." state-file)))
             (if (file-exists-p session-path) (tinydesk-recover-state session-path)
                (message (concat "Not found: " state-file)))))

    It assumes that the TinyDesk state file containing the list of files to
    edit for the project has been saved in ~/.emacs.d/config/state.[%
    appdir %]. To work on a project; change directory to the working copy,
    edit the project file Build.PL with Emacs, this will load all of the
    other files in the project into separate buffers displaying each in the
    tab bar. This Lisp code will load TinyDesk and turn tab bar mode on
    whenever a Perl file is edited:

       (add-hook 'perl-mode-hook
                 '(lambda ()
                    (require 'fic-mode) (turn-on-fic-mode) (diminish 'fic-mode nil)
                    (require 'psvn) (require 'tinydesk) (tabbar-mode t)
                    (require 'tinyperl) (diminish 'tinyperl-mode nil)))

    This Lisp code will do likewise when a dist.ini file is edited:

       (add-hook 'conf-windows-mode-hook
                 '(lambda ()
                    (require 'tinydesk) (tabbar-mode t)))

Configuration and Environment

    The configuration file defaults to
    ~/.module_provision/module_provision.json. All of the attributes listed
    in Module::Provision::Config can be set from the configuration file in
    addition to the attributes listed in Class::Usul::Config::Programs and
    Class::Usul::Config. A typical file looks like;

       {
          "author": "<first_name> <last_name>",
          "author_email": "<userid>@example.com",
          "author_id": "<userid>",
          "base": "/home/<userid>/Projects",
          "doc_title": "Perl",
          "editor": "emacs",
          "home_page": "http://www.example.com"
       }

    Creating logs and tmp directories in ~/.module_provision will cause the
    log and temporary files to use them instead of /tmp

    Extends Module::Provision::Base. Applies these traits; AddingFiles,
    CreatingDistributions, Rendering, UpdatingContent, and VCS

    This class defines no attributes
