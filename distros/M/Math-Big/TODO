The following list is not up to date:

Math::Big:
 * bernoulli() for $n > 20
 * tan() (depends on bernoulli)
 * more tests for cosh(), sinh(), tan() and all the others
 * speed up trigonometric functions (by using $CALC directly?)

Please send me test-reports, your experiences with this and your ideas - I love
to hear about my work!
