GD::Convert Module

GD::Convert is a pure perl module which provides additional output
functions for the GD module: ppm and xpm. These formats are useful if
you need to dynamically create photos for Tk. Perl/Tk lesser than
version 804 does not accept any of GD's output formats: png only via
the additional Tk::PNG module and jpeg only via the additional
Tk::JPEG module. So if you cannot compile on your system, this module
is for you.

This module also provides gif generating methods through external
programs (ImageMagick or netpbm).

To install, type

	$ perl Makefile.PL
	$ make
	$ make test
	$ make install

For Windows NT and ActiveState Perl, replace "make" with "nmake".
Otherwise, just copy Convert.pm to C:\Perl\site\lib\GD (create this
directory if not existing).

Some tests are interactive if Tk is installed and the environment
variable PERL_TEST_INTERACTIVE is set.
