   in this release instead.

0.020 -
 * Testing if the path used to find plugins actually contains
   readable directories should work better now.
 * Added const char* to typemap, which may or may not fix the
   problems building these modules on 5.6.x perls.

0.019 -
 * Fixed the tests - there was a dependency on a LADSPA plugin
   that isn't part of the ladspa dev 

0.018 -
 * Networks are now subclasses of Class::Publisher instead of
   Class::Observable.

0.017 

 * NOT RELEASED due to bugs in Class::Observable, see
   http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=19507
 * Audio::LADSPA::Network is now a subclass of Class::Observable 
 * Added sample_rate and buffer_size methods to Audio::LADSPA::Network
 * Audio::LADSPA will now only load the first version of any given
   library it finds in $ENV{LADSPA_PATH}. (this used to throw a 
   pretty useless exception).
 * Upgraded ppport.h to the version shipped with perl 5.8.8

0.016 -

   installed

 * Oops: added Scalar::Util to the prerequisites in the top-level
