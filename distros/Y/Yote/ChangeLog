	* Version 0.1015
	* updated tests

2013-12-13  Eric Wolf  <coyocanid@gmail.com>

	* updated _check_root to just change the handle and password of the existing master account rather than created a new one
	* javascript create_login changed to be called on the app, and also removed defunct register_login method (called from javascript).
	* removed EMAIL and HANDLE cache vars from Yote::YoteRoot. These were buggy, given the threaded nature of Yote. This also revealed a bug in the hash function of mongo db. It was not escaping the periods in the keys properly.

	* $.yote.util.template_edit to edit templates

2013-12-05  Eric Wolf  <coyocanid@gamil.com>

	* VERSION 0.1014
	* Changes to the javascript widgets. Added the ability for yote javascript to look for control_table and yote_panel classed items and produce a control table or yote panel in that control. A yote panel is an editable panel, but has the property that it can be in an edit mode for root but display mode otherwise.

2013-11-27  Eric Wolf  <coyocanid@gmail.com>
	* VERSION 0.1012
	* removed Yote::Util::Counter. It doesn't fit in with the new Yote, which needs less classes for more bang.
	
2013-11-27  Eric Wolf  <coyocanid@gmail.com>
	* VERSION 0.1012
	* $.yote.util.init_ui method has been created. This will cause divs to become control tables, with attributes that mirror control table init arguments. These arguments can take functions ( for example columns="!colfunction" ) or json objecs ( column_names="['Foo','Bar','Baz']" ). Should a column be a string proceded with a star, it will become editable ( like columns=['foo','*bar','baz'] ).

	
2013-11-20  Eric Wolf  <coyocanid@gmail.com>

	* VESION 0.1011
	* Object creation off of Yote::YoteRoot with the methods new_user_obj, new_obj and new_root_obj. It is hard to overstate how important the subtle changes in this update are, on the web facing side. The control_table widget is now much more powerful. Items can be created with it with arbitrary fields, provided permissions are ahdered to. This means, using entirely client side programming, objects can be defined and managed.

2013-09-19  Eric Wolf  <coyocanid@gmail.com>

	* VERSION 0.1009
	* count now can take arguments to return a count for searches too.
	* tests for different IO modules now share a common test routine.
	* object-locking is drastically changed. I've removed any automatic locking. Locks must now be called explicitly in order to work. I made this decision when I realized that most of the calls that were being made resulted in no collision most of the time. I would have kept the safer but it impacted performance way too much.
	* control_table - fixed some bugs in how the control table rendered hashes rather than lists.
	* removed stray use Yote::SQLiteIO from Yote.pm
	* unit_tests.html now up to date with the new paginate.
	* Yote::Obj now more permissive in list and hash operations
	* Yote::RootObj added. It requires root permissions for any list or hash operation
	* Yote::YoteRoot new methods : new_obj, new_root_obj - returns new Yote::Obj and Yote::RootObj objects
	* changed list and hash names/operations for Yote::Obj

2013-09-17  Eric Wolf  <coyocanid@gmail.com>

	* VERSION 0.1008
	* added --profiling option. This is a bit experimental and assumes you have Aspect installed. There is a new program, bin/perf_reader to analyze the output generated by the profiling. The perf output is to STDERR and is controlled by Yote::PerfAspect. I have not made Aspect a requirement of Yote yet, as this is not a core functionality of the program.
	* removed removed MongoDB requirements. This only applies if you want to use mongo, and the MongoDB installation is a pain in the neck. Am keeping the DBD::MySQL because it's not so big and bad.
	* is_master_root method. The initial account ( and it should only be this account ) cannot have root unset from it. This is a safety. Should __master_root and __is_root become unset, they will be reset for this account anytime the server starts up	
	* added CronEntry object for cron. Yote::Obj wasn't going to be enough - this must be editable.
	* Yote::ObjProvider::LOCK_MODE this is a very significant update as it changes how object locking happens. This can have 3 modes : LOCK_ON_WRITE, LOCK_NEVER and LOCK_ALWAYS. Yote had been locking all object access between the threads. Now I'm setting the default to be LOCK_ON_WRITE, though LOCK_NEVER is tempting too. As of this writing, the default can't be changed. This will be addressed in upcoming versions. Maybe the style should be that explicitly calling lock object. Maybe I will make Yote::ObjProvider::fetch_locked.
	* removed Yote::YoteRoot::is_root because that was based on a half baked idea.
	* admin.html changing this around to be more admin like. Sadly this is not finished, but the checkin will continue.
	* $.yote.util.check_edit( fld, checked_fun, unchecked_fun, extra_classes, on_edit_f ) - a new widget to make checkbox to control a boolean property of something.

2013-07-28  Eric Wolf  <coyocanid@gmail.com>

	* VERSION 0.1007

	* yote_server has arguments to reset password and change configuration
