This is the FullAuto Custom/BackUp directory. FullAuto will copy customized
configuration and user code files to this directory whenever its built-in
edit feature is invoked - so that a backup of these critical files is always
available. It is left to the user to determine how and when these files
should be purged. FullAuto users are HIGHLY encouraged to keep a history of
these files in some form of software version control system such as:

Apache Subversion: http://subversion.apache.org/
