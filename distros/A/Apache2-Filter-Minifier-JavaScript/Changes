Revision history for Perl extension Apache2::Filter::Minifier::JavaScript.

1.05    Fri Apr 23 22:25 PDT 2010
    - Switch to Git

1.04    Mon May  5 15:17 PDT 2008
    - no changes since 1.04_02, but is a non-devel release

1.04_02 Wed Oct 17 16:01 PDT 2007
    - decline processing if unable to determine Content-Type of document
    - lower Perl requirement to 5.6.0

1.04_01 Tue Oct 16 00:59 PDT 2007
    - added timing info to the debug logs
    - use JavaScript::Minifier::XS if available; its -MUCH- faster
    - new "JsMinifier" PerlVar, to let you specify which minifier package or
      function to use (otherwise we try J:M:XS first, falling back to J:M)

1.03    Fri Sep 28 11:09 PDT 2007
    - release; verified that changes in 1.03_01 for configuration requirements
      worked as intended when doing CPANPLUS test runs

1.03_01 Thu Sep 27 13:27 PDT 2007
    - rewrote Build.PL/Makefile.PL so they now check if you've got Apache::Test
      installed -at-configuration-time-.  If not, the build is aborted.  One
      day, CPAN(PLUS) et al. will support "configure_requires", but until then
      we've got to check for this ourselves.
    - fixed Content-Type filtering so that it now properly handles HTTP headers
      that have additional attributes (e.g. "charset=...")

1.02    Wed Sep 26  1:25 PDT 2007
    - added Makefile.PL, so CPANPLUS testers stop failing tests because they
      don't have Module::Build installed

1.01    Fri Sep 21 13:31 PDT 2007
    - added explicit dependency on MP2
    - updated test requirements to "need_*" instead of "have_*"

1.00    Thu Sep 20 12:45 PDT 2007
    - initial version
