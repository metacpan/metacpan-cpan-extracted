1.004	2014-10-25 05:07:26 UTC

	Tweak how we skip/disable plugins because of the recent subtest change, I broke some stuff :(
	I give up on the Pod::No404s test, the internet is too flaky everywhere :(

	Thanks everyone who sent RT tickets to clean up the FAILs :)
	Finally enabled the Test::Vars plugin as I've switched over to using subtests instead of Test::Block

1.002	2011-04-21 21:49:46 UTC

	Add more default exclusions to the Perl::Critic default .perlcriticrc

1.001	2011-03-08 21:37:20 UTC

	Tweaked the OutdatedPrereqs test so it will correctly FAIL if a prereq wasn't found on CPAN

0.10	0000-00-00 00:00:00 UTC

		This means certain tests are disabled when AUTOMATED is set :)
	Minor POD/Build.PL/test output tweaks
	Added META.json to FileChecks test
	Bumped Test::Strict prereq to 0.14 because now it works with Moose!
