Net::RabbitMQ::Java provides full Perl bindings and OOP
interface to the RabbitMQ AMQP client library.

------------------
Requirements
------------------

Net::RabbitMQ::Java depends on Inline::Java, which is usually
not so difficult to install. You just need to have Java SDK 
installed on your system (apt-get install openjdk-6-jdk for
Ubuntu/Debian users).

------------------
Basic Installation
------------------

Net::RabbitMQ::Java may be installed through the CPAN shell in
the usual manner.  Typically:

  $ perl -MCPAN -e 'install Net::RabbitMQ::Java'

You can also read this README from the CPAN shell:

  $ perl -MCPAN -e shell
  cpan> readme Net::RabbitMQ::Java

And you can install the component from the CPAN prompt as well:

  cpan> install Net::RabbitMQ::Java

-------------------
Manual Installation
-------------------

This module may also be installed manually.  Its distribution is
available from the author's CPAN directory,
<ftp://ftp.cpan.org/pub/CPAN/authors/id/A/AA/AAR/>, or a similarly
named directory at your favorite CPAN mirror.

Downloading and unpacking the distribution are left as exercises for
the reader.  To build and test it:

  perl Makefile.PL
  make test

To test against a specific server and/or port you can pass them as
environment variables:

  env MQHOST="localhost" MQPORT="5673" make test

When you're ready to install the component:

  make install

It should now be ready to use.

Thanks for reading!
