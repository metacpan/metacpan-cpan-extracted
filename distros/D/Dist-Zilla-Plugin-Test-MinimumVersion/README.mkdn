# NAME

Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Test::MinimumVersion - Author tests for minimum required versions

# VERSION

version 2.000008

# SYNOPSIS

In `dist.ini`:

    [Test::MinimumVersion]
    max_target_perl = 5.10.1

# DESCRIPTION

This is an extension of [Dist::Zilla::Plugin::InlineFiles](https://metacpan.org/pod/Dist::Zilla::Plugin::InlineFiles), providing a
[Test::MinimumVersion](https://metacpan.org/pod/Test::MinimumVersion) test:

    xt/author/minimum-version.t - a standard Test::MinimumVersion test

You should provide the highest perl version you want to require as
`target_max_version`. If you accidentally use perl features that are newer
than that version number, then the test will fail, and you can go change
whatever bumped up the minimum perl version required.
