         [NOT BACKWARD COMPATIBLE]
        - significantly rewritten by rjbs, in terms of roles rather than
          subclasses - re-read the documentation!
        - HTTP::Throwable::Factory is now the piece intended most for end users
        - should be significantly easier to both use and extend

        - add proper support for RFC 2324 (thanks rjbs)
        - allowing more than one Proxy-Authenticate header

          could have mentioned it before I released 0.004 :P)

0.002 Tues. Feb. 8, 2011
        - normalize *_location attributes to all be
          called location, since that is the name of the
          header
        - any time we allow additional headers to be
          passed in, the attribute is now called
          additional_headers instead of whatever it was
          before (usually cache_headers)
        - change the valid_methods attribute in
          HTTP::Throwable::MethodNotAllowed to be just
          allow (which is what the header is)
            - improved the type check on this as well
        - make the exceptions also function as PSGI apps
            - add to_app method
            - support &{} overload
            - added tests for this
        - overload stringification
            - added tests for this
