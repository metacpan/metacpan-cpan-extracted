# Use this file to add to the documentation generation system a set of
# C type name to Perl type description mappings for types which are not
# registered with the GLib type system.  This allows the documentation
# system to produce useful type names or descriptions in documentation.
# The C type name should have no spaces; namely, do NOT include
# "const" and/or "*".  Also, "_ornull" is handled for you ("or undef" gets
# appended to the description).  The description may have spaces.
