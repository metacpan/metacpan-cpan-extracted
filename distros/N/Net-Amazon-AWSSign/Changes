0.07  Mon Oct 26 11:40:07 2009

0.10  Tue Aug 16 11:04:07 2011
	- Before uri encoding arg string, uri decode them first.  This allows for escaped chars in the arguments, specifically ampersand

0.11  Tue Aug 16 12:06:58 2011
	- Added the whole escaping thing in the documentation.  Shame on me for forgetting.
