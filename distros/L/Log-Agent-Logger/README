Log::Agent     ----  A general logging framework                  RAM
::Logger       adpO  Application-level logging interface          RAM


The Log::Agent::Logger module is an extension of Log::Agent that brings
an application-level logging API.

It is separated from Log::Agent itself because it has dependencies
on other CPAN modules that Log::Agent cannot afford to have:
everyone with a plain stock Perl distribution must be able to simply
install Log::Agent and start using it.

SYNOPSIS
     require Log::Agent::Logger;

     my $log = Log::Agent::Logger->make(
         -channel    => $chan,
         -max_prio   => 'info',
         -min_prio   => 'emerg',
     );
     $log->error("can't open file %s: $!", $file);
     $log->warning("can't open file $file: $!");

DESCRIPTION
    The `Log::Agent::Logger' class defines a generic interface for
    application logging. It must not be confused with the interface
    provided by Log::Agent, which is meant to be used by re-usable
    modules that do not wish to commit on a particular logging method,
    so that they remain true building blocks.

    By contrast, `Log::Agent::Logger' explicitely requests an object to
    be used, and that object must commit upon the logging channel to be
    used, at creation time.

    Optionally, minimum and maximum priority levels may be defined
    (and changed dynamically) to limit the messages to effectively
    log, depending on the advertised priority. The standard syslog(3)
    priorities are used.
