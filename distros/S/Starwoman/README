NAME

    Starwoman - because Starman does the same thing over and over again
    expecting different results

VERSION

    version 0.001

SYNOPSIS

      # Run app.psgi with the default settings
      > starwoman
    
      # run with Server::Starter
      > start_server --port 127.0.0.1:80 -- starwoman --workers 32 myapp.psgi
    
      # UNIX domain sockets
      > starwoman --listen /tmp/starwoman.sock

    Read more options and configurations by running `perldoc starwoman`
    (lower-case s).

DESCRIPTION

    Starwoman is a PSGI perl web server that has unique features such as:

    High Performance

      Uses the fast XS/C HTTP header parser

    Preforking

      Spawns workers preforked like most high performance UNIX servers do.
      Starwoman also reaps dead children and automatically restarts the
      worker pool.

    Signals

      Supports HUP for graceful worker restarts, and TTIN/TTOU to
      dynamically increase or decrease the number of worker processes, as
      well as QUIT to gracefully shutdown the worker processes.

    Superdaemon aware

      Supports Server::Starter for hot deploy and graceful restarts.

    Multiple interfaces and UNIX Domain Socket support

      Able to listen on multiple interfaces including UNIX sockets.

    Small memory footprint

      Preloading the applications with --preload-app command line option
      enables copy-on-write friendly memory management. Also, the minimum
      memory usage Starwoman requires for the master process is 7MB and
      children (workers) is less than 3.0MB.

    PSGI compatible

      Can run any PSGI applications and frameworks

    HTTP/1.1 support

      Supports chunked requests and responses, keep-alive and pipeline
      requests.

    UNIX only

      This server does not support Win32.

PERFORMANCE

    Here's a simple benchmark using Hello.psgi.

      -- server: Starwoman (workers=10)
      Requests per second:    6849.16 [#/sec] (mean)
      -- server: Twiggy
      Requests per second:    3911.78 [#/sec] (mean)
      -- server: AnyEvent::HTTPD
      Requests per second:    2738.49 [#/sec] (mean)
      -- server: HTTP::Server::PSGI
      Requests per second:    2218.16 [#/sec] (mean)
      -- server: HTTP::Server::PSGI (workers=10)
      Requests per second:    2792.99 [#/sec] (mean)
      -- server: HTTP::Server::Simple
      Requests per second:    1435.50 [#/sec] (mean)
      -- server: Corona
      Requests per second:    2332.00 [#/sec] (mean)
      -- server: POE
      Requests per second:    503.59 [#/sec] (mean)

    This benchmark was processed with ab -c 10 -t 1 -k on MacBook Pro 13"
    late 2009 model on Mac OS X 10.6.2 with perl 5.10.0. YMMV.

NOTES

    Because Starwoman runs as a preforking model, it is not recommended to
    serve the requests directly from the internet, especially when slow
    requesting clients are taken into consideration. It is suggested to put
    Starwoman workers behind the frontend servers such as nginx, and use
    HTTP proxy with TCP or UNIX sockets.

    This is a fork of Starman for one particular reason: to stop the
    endless forking of immediately dying children when app.psgi can't be
    loaded, which flooded the log file and pegged the CPU. Starman hasn't
    been maintained, hence the fork. Do not assume I will be any better
    about maintaining this, considering how much attention I give to
    projects I wrote myself.
