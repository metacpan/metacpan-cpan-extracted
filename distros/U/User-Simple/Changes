Revision history for Perl extension User::Simple.
1.45 Tue Jun 18 16:24:21 CDT 2013

     	- Turns out the POD checks actually need a charset to be
          explicitly declared, even if using UTF. Go know. Anyway,
          thanks (again!) to gregor herrmann.

1.44 Tue Jun 18 13:09:03 CDT 2013

        - Reencoded the files as UTF8. Older encoding systems must
          die.
	- One missing pair of parentheses caused the admin module
          to fail building under Perl 5.18. Thanks to gregor herrmann
          for reporting it!

1.43 Tue Jan 20 13:37:10 CST 2009

        - Dropped spurious requirement of YAML in the test suite (that
          was added as a debugging aid :-/ ) Thanks to Slaven Rezic
          for pointing it out...

1.42 Wed Dec 10 17:22:19 CST 2008
        - Fixed a session hash predictability/clash vulnerability,
	  reported by Eugene V. Lyubimkin via Damyan Ivanov. Thanks!

1.40 Fri Jun 27 11:35:01 CDT 2008
        - Bah... Why jump through that many hoops? Moving away from
	  ExtUtils::MakeMaker to Module::Build

1.38 Wed Jun 25 17:30:31 CDT 2008
        - "The Kwalitee release"
	- Added Test::Pod test
	- Regenerated META.yml to be valid. Where did I take mine
	  from?! 
	- Completed license, author license, both in META.yml and in
	  LICENSE 
	- But still, no real, substantive changes!

1.37 Mon Jun 23 10:41:00 CDT 2008
     	- Fixed remaining file locking problem which caused the tests
	  to fail in *BSD systems. Thanks to Slaven Rezic and CPANTS
	  for helping me spot and fix the bug!

1.36 Sun Jun 15 23:56:56 CDT 2008
        - Umh... since the very early revisions (0.9?), I was only
	  explicitly skipping 14 tests if DBD::XBase is not
	  installed. Updating it to 37. Grr.
	- Changed the tests to run under SQLite3 instead of DBD::XBase
	  - A bit more reliable, it seems

1.35
        - Gah... Using DBD::XBase in the tests lets many subtle
          problems slip by... For example, 1.3 was released with a
          broken User::Admin::new_user :-/

1.3 Thu Oct  6 13:21:56 CDT 2005
	- By popular demand, User::Simple (not necessarily from within
	  ::Admin) can modify the user data - Not only that, but also
	  a subtle distinction was added: fields called beginning with
	  adm_ are not modifiable by it.

1.23 Sun Oct  2 11:45:35 CDT 2005
	- Bugfix: Some DBDs return uppercase fields, some
	  lowercase... Try to handle them all correctly (or at least,
	  not as incorrectly :) )

1.22 Mon Sep 26 19:47:12 2005
        - Bugfix: Last remanent of old name/level structure
	  removed. Thanks, Alex Juarez!
	- Minimum required Perl version reduced to 5.8 (was 5.8.7)

1.2  Fri Sep 23 13:43:00 2005
        - API CHANGE - API CHANGE - API CHANGE: Some changes in
	  User::Admin::Simple (in user creation, database structure creation)
	- Added generic (AUTOLOADed) methods to both User::Simple and
	  User::Simple::Admin to deal with unknown attributes in the
	  table
	- Finally (completely) removed the deprecated is_admin
	  infrastructure 
	- Name and level are not explicitly implemented from within
	  the class, they become (if required by the user) AUTOLOADed.
	- Added examples/user-simple-admin, a command-line interface
	  for managing User::Simple tables

1.1  Thu Sep 08 14:40:05 2005
        - Never really released, but PAUSE won't allow me to re-use
	  this version number... Sorry

1.0  Sun Aug 21 23:06:08 2005
        - Now correctly works with any kind of DBD backend
	- Added a complete test suite, which surprisingly worked!

0.9  Sat Jul 30 10:45:15 2005
	- Added Date::Calc and Digest::MD5 as prerequisite modules
        - Added a more granular 'level' for the users instead of the 
	  all-or-nothing is_admin infrastructure
	- Modified the is_admin infrastructure so old code works
	  seamlessly with the new version (although sends out some
	  warnings, as is_admin is officially deprecated)
        - Added/clarified some documentation

0.8  Wed Jun 15 10:52:29 2005
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.23 with options
		-X User::Simple
