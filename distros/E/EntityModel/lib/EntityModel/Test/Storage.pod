=head1 NAME

EntityModel::Test::Storage - tests for L<EntityModel::Storage> and subclasses

=head1 VERSION

version 0.102

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use EntityModel::Test::Storage;
 storage_ok('EntityModel::Storage::Perl', '::Perl subclass works');

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Provides functions for testing L<EntityModel::Storage> subclasses.

=head1 EXPORTS

Since this is a test class, functions are exported automatically
to match behaviour of other test modules such as L<Test::More>.
To disable this, pass an empty list on the C<use> line or
use C<require> instead:

 use EntityModel::Test::Storage ();
 EntityModel::Test::Storage::storage_ok(...);

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=head2 storage_ok

Runs all available tests (including attempting to load the module) and returns the usual
L<Test::Builder> ok/fail response.

=head2 storage_methods_ok

Check whether the expected methods are present. Requires the class to be loaded first.

=head2 _methods_ok

Internal helper function to report whether the expected methods are present for the subclass.

=head2 _simple_model

=head2 _report_status

Internal helper function to report pass/fail via L<Test::Builder>.
