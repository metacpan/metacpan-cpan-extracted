Net-Z3950-Simple2ZOOM
=====================

This module implements a program, simple2zoom, which acts as a
general-purpose gateway between the two standard information retrieval
protocols ANSI/NISO Z39.50-2003 and SRU/SRW.  It's not likely that the
library modules will be useful for any other purpose.

Information about Z39.50 is available at the maintenancy agency site:
	http://www.loc.gov/z3950/agency/document.html

Information about SRU and its brother SRW is available from:
	http://www.loc.gov/standards/sru/


INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules and libraries:

  - the Net::Z3950::SimpleServer Perl module
  - the Net::Z3950::ZOOM Perl module

These in turn rely on the YAZ toolkit's Generic Frontend Server (for
the server side) and ZOOM API (for the client side) to handle the
Z39.50 and SRU/SRW protocol mechanics.
