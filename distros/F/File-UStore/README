NAME

    File::UStore - UUID based File Storage Module.

VERSION

    version 0.16

SYNOPSIS

         use File::UStore;
         my $store = new File::UStore( path => "/home/shantanu/.teststore", 
             prefix => "prefix_",
             depth  => 5
         );
     
         open( my $FH, "foo.pl" ) or die "Unable to open file ";
         # Add a file in the store
         my $id = $store->add(*$FH);
         # Get file handle from uuid. 
         my $handle = $store->get($id);
         print <$handle>;
     
         # Return the filesystem location from a uuid
         my $location = $store->getPath($id);
     
         # Remove a file by its uuid from the store
         $store->remove("7d4d873e-4bf4-41a5-8696-fd6232f7bdda");

DESCRIPTION

    File::UStore is a perl library based on File::HStore to store files on
    a filesystem using a UUID based randomized storage with folder depth
    control over storage.File::UStore is a library that allows users to
    abstract file storage using a UUID based pointer instead of File Hashes
    to store the file. This is a critical feature for code which requires
    even duplicate files to get a unique identifier each time they are
    added to a store. A Hash Storage on the other hand will not allow a
    file to be duplicated if it is stored multiple time in the same store.
    This can cause issues in cases where files are deleted regularly as
    there would be no way of knowing if a second process is still using the
    file which the first process might be about to delete.

    The current version uses UUID Module to generate universally unique
    identifiers everytime a file is to be stored.

    The Module also provides a option to choose the folder depth at which a
    file is stored. This can be changed from the default value of 3.
    Increasing depth is advisable if the store might contain a large number
    of files in your use case. This will help to avoid having a too large
    number of files in any single folder.

METHODS

 new

        $store = File::UStore->new( 
            path => "/home/shantanu/.teststore", 
            prefix => "prefix_", depth  => 5 
        );

    This constructor returns a new File::UStore object encapsulating a
    specific store. The path specifies where the UStore is located on the
    filesystem. If the path is not specified, the path ~/.ustore is used.
    The $prefix is an extension to specify the prefix appended before
    unique file name.

 add

        my $id = $store->add($filename)

    The $filename is the path of the file to be added in the store. The
    return value is the uuid ($id) of the file stored. From this point on
    the user will only be able to refer to this file using $id.

    Returns undef on error.

 remove

        $store->remove($id)

    The $id is the uuid of the file to be removed from the store.

    Returns false on success and undef on error.

 get

        $store->get($id)

    Returns the file handle of the file from its uuid. Returns undef on
    error.

 getPath

        $store->getPath($id)

    Returns the filesystem location of the file from its uuid. Returns
    undef on error.

USE CASE FOR THIS MODULE IN LIEU OF A HASH BASED STORAGE

    File::HStore is a similar module that provides File Hash based storage.
    However due to the nature of File Hashing, File::HStore doesn't allow
    duplicates. If the same file is stored a second time using File::HStore
    it transparently returns the same hash it had returned last time as an
    id without adding any new file in storage due to inherent character of
    hash based storage, while this is useful if a user doesn't want any
    duplicates occurring in a storage, this apparently trivial difference
    is risky in the use case where two processes upload a duplicate file to
    the store and both processes want to do file handling on these files
    simultaneously, only one of the processes will be able to get a
    lock(deletion,manipulation etc.) on the file at a time and if the first
    process deletes the file referred to by its ID, the second process will
    never know what happened to the file it added. However in circumstances
    where filename based deduplication is desired you must use
    L<File::HStore> instead.

    Hence to serve this unique use case I wrote this module for a UUID
    based storage solution which is not hostage to auto de-duping features
    of HStore. This module returns a unique file id each time a file is
    uploaded even if its a duplicate of existing file previously uploaded.
    This allows multiple processes handling data from a common file dump to
    access the same file. This module also expands on the Hstore to allow
    the user flexibility of choosing the depth of storage to optimize the
    performance for the users application. Depth of storage allows users to
    make the balance between average "number of files in a folder" and
    folder depth.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

    Thanks to Alexandre Dulaunoy for the excellent File::HStore module
    which along with my own special need provided the idea behind this
    module.
