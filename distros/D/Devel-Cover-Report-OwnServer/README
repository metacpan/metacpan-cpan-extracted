Name

    Devel::Cover::Report::OwnServer - Post test coverage summary to
    selected service

Synopsis

       perl Build.PL
       ./Build
       template="https://your_coverage_server/coverage/report/%s"
       cover --uri_template ${template} -test -report ownServer
    
       # OR
    
       export COVERAGE_URI="https://your_coverage_server/coverage/report/%s"
       perl Build.PL && ./Build && cover -test -report ownServer

Description

    Post test coverage summary to selected service

Configuration and Environment

    Either the uri_template option or the COVERAGE_URI environment variable
    should point to your coverage server. One string will be interpolated;
    the lower-cased distribution name. The default template is;

       http://localhost:5000/coverage/report/%s

    The value of the environment variable COVERAGE_TOKEN is sent to the
    server along with the coverage report summary. The token is used to
    authenticate post from the integration server to the coverage server.
    For Travis-CI use the command

       travis encrypt COVERAGE_TOKEN=<insert your token here>

    and place the output in your .travis.yml file

       env:
         global:
           - secure: <base64 encoded output from travis encrypt>

    This Travis encrypt command must be run from within the working copy of
    the repository as it detects the repository name and uses it to salt
    the encryption
