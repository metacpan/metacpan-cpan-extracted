Revision history for Perl extension Apache::PAR.
0.30  Thu Aug 25 23:30:00 2003
	- Added support for reloading modules from within PAR files
	  Thanks to Raymond Field for the report
	- Added support for unpacking content of PAR files
	  Thanks to Maurice Aubrey for the implementation!
	  Use PerlSetVar PARTempDir to specify (defaults to platform temp dir)
	  and ##UNPACKDIR## within web.conf to enable/use
	- New tests and documentation to reflect these changes.
	- Note: Apache::PAR now requires PAR .74 due to required changes for
	  reload functionality
0.21  Sat Jun 07 22:00:00 2003
	- Changed required version of Apache::Test to 1.01 - 1.03 was not
	  on CPAN
0.20  Sun Jun 03 ??:??:?? 2003
	- Changed to use Apache::Test for tests - testing should now work
	  on Win32 and mod_perl 2.x
	  ** Note: Apache::Test is now a required module for Apache::PAR **
	- tutorial.pod moved under PAR (shouldn't go in main Apache dir)
	- Change for consistancy with PAR.pm to default PerlRun and Registry
	  scripts to use the /script directory instead of /scripts.
	  ** All modules must be updated with this change **
	  Modules can be updated by either changing the directory name
	  inside the PAR archive, or by setting PARRegistyPath or 
	  PARPerlRunPath to scripts/ within a web.conf
	  Thanks to Autrijus Tang <autrijus@autrijus.org> for this fix.
0.14  Sun Apr 30 13:00:00 2003
	- Added ability to do caching to the Apache::PAR::Static module
	  (see documentation in that module for details.)  To use caching
	  the Cache::Cache module is required 
	- Some general code cleanup performed
	- Switched to Eclipse IDE for editing / CVS management of project
	- Removed use warnings to work with old versions of Perl
	- Removed exporter tags from PAR.pm since we weren't using
	  them anyway.
	- Removed Win32 "fix" that wasn't necessary

0.12  Thu Mar 27 22:00:00 2003
	- Some testing performed on Win32 platforms Win 98 and Win 2k 
	  (thanks to Raymond Field.  Documentation changed to reflect 
	  necessary changes to get Apache::PAR up and running on Win32.
	- Better mod_perl 2.x detection.  No longer requires 
	  Apache::ServerUtil
	- Support for Apache::Static pulling from root directory of 
	  PAR file
	- New configuration mechanism, through PARInclude directive and
	  use/include lines in startup.pl or PERL sections
0.11  Mon Mar 10 21:51:00 2003
	- Changes to stay compatible with latest mod_perl CVS.  This
	  change is not backwards compatible, however.  For mod_perl 2.x
	  the CVS version is currently required
	- Some code cleanup
	- Added more tests (not yet complete)
	- Made errors from Archive::Zip silent (less noise to logs)
	- Added additional tests
	- Apache::PAR::Registry was using PARPerlRunPath instead of 
	  PARRegistryPath, identified by Raymond Field
	- PARPerlRunPath and PARRegistryPath failed to find contents 
	  if set to "/", identified by Raymond Field
	- WIN32 fix (untested) for setting ##PARFILE## to reasonable value 
	  on that platform for Apache, identified by Raymond Field
0.10  Sat Feb 01 21:20:00 2003
	- Added initial support for mod_perl 2!
	- See TODO for more information
