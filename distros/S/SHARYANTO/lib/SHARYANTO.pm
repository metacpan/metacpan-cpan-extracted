=head1 FAQ

=head2 What is this? Why SHARYANTO::*?

The SHARYANTO namespace is used by me for B<temporary> placeholder for modules
that are either alpha quality, unstable, lacking tests and/or documentation, or
that haven't found a proper name yet.

I put such modules on CPAN because some of my other modules (and scripts) depend
on it.

To reiterate, this namespace is for temporary placeholder and not for vanity :)

I encourage other authors to do the same.

=head2 Why not something like Tmp::<CPAN ID>::*?

I haven't decided on what is the best name to use for the "Tmp" part. It should
be slightly better, in theory.

=head1 SEE ALSO

L<Alt> (where there will similarly be subdivided by CPAN ID's, like
Alt::INGY::*, Alt::SHARYANTO::*, etc) is slightly different in nature. It is for
alternate implementation and does not imply a temporary nature.
