    You can use Alien::Box2D in your module that needs to link with *Box2D*
    library like this:

        # Sample Build.pl
        use Module::Build;
        use Alien::Box2D;

        my $build = Module::Build->new(
          module_name => 'Any::Box2D::Module',
          # + other params
          build_requires => {
                        'Alien::Box2D' => 0,
                        # + others modules
          },
          configure_requires => {
                        'Alien::Box2D' => 0,
                        # + others modules
          },
          extra_compiler_flags => Alien::Box2D->config('cflags'),
          extra_linker_flags   => Alien::Box2D->config('libs'),
