VERSION
    version 1.121830

SYNOPSIS
            use DataFlow;

            my $flow = DataFlow->new(
                    procs => [
                        DataFlow::Proc->new( p => sub { do this thing } ), # a Proc
                            sub { ... do something },   # a code ref
                            'UC',                       # named Proc
                            [                           # named Proc, with parameters
                              CSV => {
                                    direction     => 'CONVERT_TO',
                                    text_csv_opts => { binary => 1 },
                              }
                            ],
                            # named Proc, named "Proc"
                            [ Proc => { p => sub { do this other thing }, deref => 1 } ],
                            DataFlow->new( ... ),       # another flow
                    ]
            );

            $flow->input( <some input> );
            my $output = $flow->output();

            my $output = $flow->output( <some other input> );

            # other ways to invoke the constructor
            my $flow = DataFlow->new( sub { .. do something } );   # pass a sub
            my $flow = DataFlow->new( [                            # pass an array
                    sub { ... do this },
                    'UC',
                    [
                      HTMLFilter => (
                        search_xpath => '//td',
                            result_type  => 'VALUE'
                      )
                    ]
            ] );
            my $flow = DataFlow->new( $another_flow ); # pass another DataFlow or Proc

            # other way to pass the data through
            my $output = $flow->process( qw/long list of data/ );

DESCRIPTION
    A "DataFlow" object is able to accept data, feed it into an array of
    processors (DataFlow::Proc objects), and return the result(s) back to
    the caller.

ATTRIBUTES
  name
    (Str) A descriptive name for the dataflow. (OPTIONAL)

  default_channel
    (Str) The name of the default communication channel. (DEFAULT:
    'default')

  auto_process
    (Bool) If there is data available in the output queue, and one calls the
    "output()" method, this attribute will flag whether the dataflow should
    attempt to automatically process queued data. (DEFAULT: true)

  procs
    (ArrayRef[DataFlow::Role::Processor]) The list of processors that make
    this DataFlow. Optionally, you may pass CodeRefs that will be
    automatically converted to DataFlow::Proc objects. (REQUIRED)

    The "procs" parameter will accept some variations in its value. Any
    "ArrayRef" passed will be parsed, and additionaly to plain
    "DataFlow::Proc" objects, it will accept: "DataFlow" objects (so one can
    nest flows), code references ("sub{}" blocks), array references and
    plain text strings. Refer to DataFlow::Types for more information on
    these different forms of passing the "procs" parameter.

    Additionally, one may pass any of these forms as a single argument to
    the constructor "new", plus a single "DataFlow", or "DataFlow:Proc" or
    string.

METHODS
  has_queued_data
    Returns true if the dataflow contains any queued data within.

  clone
    Returns another instance of a "DataFlow" using the same array of
    processors.

  input
    Accepts input data for the data flow. It will gladly accept anything
    passed as parameters. However, it must be noticed that it will not be
    able to make a distinction between arrays and hashes. Both forms below
    will render the exact same results:

            $flow->input( qw/all the simple things/ );
            $flow->input( all => 'the', simple => 'things' );

    If you do want to handle arrays and hashes differently, we strongly
    suggest that you use references:

            $flow->input( [ qw/all the simple things/ ] );
            $flow->input( { all => the, simple => 'things' } );

    Processors using the DataFlow::Policy::ProcessInto policy (default) will
    process the items inside an array reference, and the values (not the
    keys) inside a hash reference.

  channel_input
    Accepts input data into a specific channel for the data flow:

            $flow->channel_input( 'mydatachannel', qw/all the simple things/ );

  process_input
    Processes items in the array of queues and place at least one item in
    the output (last) queue. One will typically call this to flush out some
    unwanted data and/or if "auto_process" has been disabled.

  output_items
    Fetches items, more specifically objects of the type DataFlow::Item,
    from the data flow. If called in scalar context it will return one
    processed item from the flow. If called in list context it will return
    all the items from the last queue.

  output
    Fetches data from the data flow. It accepts a parameter that points from
    which data channel the data must be fetched. If no channel is specified,
    it will default to the 'default' channel. If called in scalar context it
    will return one processed item from the flow. If called in list context
    it will return all the elements in the last queue.

  reset
    Clears all data in the dataflow and makes it ready for a new run.

  flush
    Flushes all the data through the dataflow, and returns the complete
    result set.

  process
    Immediately processes a bunch of data, without touching the object
    queues. It will process all the provided data and return the complete
    result set for it.

  proc_by_index
    Expects an index (Num) as parameter. Returns the index-th processor in
    this data flow, or "undef" otherwise.

  proc_by_name
    Expects a name (Str) as parameter. Returns the first processor in this
    data flow, for which the "name" attribute has the same value of the
    "name" parameter, or "undef" otherwise.

FUNCTIONS
  dataflow
    Syntax sugar function that can be used to instantiate a new flow. It can
    be used like this:

            my $flow = dataflow
                    [ 'Proc' => p => sub { ... } ],
                    ...
                    [ 'CSV' => direction => 'CONVERT_TO' ];

            $flow->process('bananas');

HISTORY
    This is a framework for data flow processing. It started as a spin-off
    project from the OpenData-BR <http://www.opendatabr.org/> initiative.

    As of now (Mar, 2011) it is still a 'work in progress', and there is a
    lot of progress to make. It is highly recommended that you read the
    tests, and the documentation of DataFlow::Proc, to start with.

    An article has been recently written in Brazilian Portuguese about this
    framework, per the São Paulo Perl Mongers "Equinócio" (Equinox) virtual
    event. Although an English version of the article in in the plans, you
    can figure a good deal out of the original one at

    <http://sao-paulo.pm.org/equinocio/2011/mar/5>

    UPDATE: DataFlow is a fast-evolving project, and this article, as it was
    published there, refers to versions 0.91.x of the framework. There has
    been a big refactor since then and, although the concept remains the
    same, since version 0.950000 the programming interface has been changed
    violently.

    Any doubts, feel free to get in touch.
