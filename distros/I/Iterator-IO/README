Iterator::IO version 0.02
=========================

This module provides some file and filesystem iterators.

See the "Iterator" module for more information on what an iterator
is, and how to use it.


EXAMPLES

Read a file, line by line:

    $fh = ifile ($filename);
    while ($fh->isnt_exhausted)
    {
        $line = $fh->value;
        # do something with $line
    }

Read a file, line by line, in reverse order:

    $fh = ifile_reverse ($filename);
    while ($fh->isnt_exhausted)
    {
        $line = $fh->value;
        # do something with $line
    }

Read a directory listing, entry by entry:

    $dh = idir_listing ($path);
    while ($dh->isnt_exhausted)
    {
        $filename = $dh->value;
        # do something with $filename
    }

DEVELOPMENT STATE

This is a brand-new module.  It has a decent test suite, but has
not been extensively field-tested.  Therefore, it should be considered
"beta" software, and used with care.

If you find any bugs, or if any behavior of Iterator surprises you,
I would be grateful if you could send me an email message about it.
Thanks.
