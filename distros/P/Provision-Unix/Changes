0.90 Feb 12, 2010
  - fixed typo in P:U:V:L:Xen module.

0.89 Feb 12, 2010
  - instead of using system calls result code, check if xen disk image is 
    mounted after attempt to unmount it.
  - increased test VPS disk size from 2 to 4GB

0.87 Jan 14, 2010
  - added eval around $xen_conf->read_file, as it throws an exception if it
    fails to find the config file.
  - xen destroy would sometimes fail because the disk image was marked as in

  - added publish_arp method, that updates switch/routers after moving an IP
  - after migrating an account, run the publish_arp on the new HW node
  - moved xen snapshot dir from $HOME/mnt to $HOME/snap

0.82 Nov 30, 2009
  - changed openvz to expect disk_space to be provided in MB (was GB).

  - added enable/disable functions for prov_web & apache
  - fail gracefully when reporting last error, if no errors exist

0.69 Sep 25, 2009
  - OpenVZ template fetching via URL needs to strip off .tar.gz from the
    template filename before using it with vzctl create.

0.68 Sep 24, 2009
  - Xen get_fs_root method failed to pass $name argument
  - report errors in P:U:V:L:X:get_fs_* methods
  - P:U:User:Linux::exists* methods failed for and uig/gid of zero
  - P:U:V, added @std_opts and %std_opts, removing 75 lines of redundant code
  - replace curl with $util->get_url to fetch kernel modules in P:U:V:L.
  - added dir param to $util->get_url, moves d/l file to that dir

  - allow ovz suspended config file to be .suspended (as well as .suspend)
  - when enabling, disabling, starting, and stopping a VE, succeed if the VE
    is already in the target state. Previously, if a 'disable' request was 
    issued on an already disabled VE, it would throw an error. Etc.
  - for xen VE, check for alternate names of kernel and ramdisk, resorting to
    a glob of /boot if none of the predefined names exist.
  - try unmounting Xen disk images before start (start often fails b/c disk
    image is already mounted. This works around that).

  - added P:U:V:mount_disk_image
  - added better error handling when template extraction fails
  - remoteagent returns the last error encountered instead of a generic error

  - added ssh key restrictions for console logins
  - finished setup of Xen console accounts
  - cleanup Xen console accounts upon destruction of VE
  - P:U:U:file_write safe mode additions weren't safe when append option
    selected. fixed.
  - P:U:User:Linux, restart nscd after altering passwd files
  - P:U:U:L, create /etc/group account before user account

  - always install custom /etc/rc.local upon VE creation
  - added prov_virtual --action=console method (drops shell user into VE)

0.65 Aug 11, 2009
  - updated remoteagent, much simpler script now, and no longer requires a 
    recent version of Getopt::Long (any version will do). 
  - fixed test error in t/VirtualOS.t
  - added more audit messages to virtualos->get_status requests
  - on Linux, when install libwww, rename port from standard perl-libwww to
    perl-libwww-perl (who thought that one up?)
  - added get_version VirtualOS call, which returns the P:U version.

0.64 Aug 07, 2009
  - fixed bug in get_template_list. Local templates where returned as a scalar
    list where remote templates were returned as a hash list. Return as hashes.

  - if an ovz VE is already suspended/disabled, succeed at subsequent attempts
  - if an ovz VE is suspended, enable it before destroying (vzctl requires it)
  - switched default DNS server to NicTool (was tinydns) causing DNS tests to
    fail on systems w/o NicTool installed. Added error handling to prevent test
    suite breakage under these circumstances, and reset the default DNS server.

0.58  Jun 23, 2009

  - fixed a get_the_date test error that caused the test suite to fail
  - OpenVZ will create a reasonable default config and use it for new VEs if a
    config is not specific (was causing test builds to fail if the template

0.55  Jun 10, 2009
  - added ability to fetch templates from repo via HTTP

    list and fetch templates from a central repo

0.53  Apr 30, 2009
  - further enhancements to error reporting
  - VirtualOS/Xen was reporting non-existent ve as 'missing', changed to
    'non-existent' for consistency

0.52  Apr 14, 2009
  - DNS/NicTool was calling get_zone_id but sub was named get_zone
  - abstracted gen_salt out of get_crypted_password and added logic to choose
    MD5 on platforms where it's available and fall back to DES if not
  - added tests for get_salt and get_crypted_password
  - push errors onto the audit stack as well (as error stack)
  - added Config::Tiny to list of modules in install_prov_unix.pl
  - removed 'message => ' named parameter in calls to error ( brevity)
  - enhancements to Xen.pm for better error handling and reporting

0.51  Apr 07, 2009
  - added bin/set_vps_password.pl
  - Xen set_password only tries to set the console password if the user exists
  - replaced specific state checks in OpenVZ start with is_running checks
  - OpenVZ startup tests are more reliable now.
  - don't check results of vzctl --userpassword, since it doesn't return a
    valid result.
  - added a set_password test to VirtualOS.t
  - pass the $user->exists tests, even if the user is missing. Some CPAN
    testers like to configure their test environs in interesting ways.
  - removed audit calls before syscmd calls b/c syscmd calls audit itself
    (remove duplicated messages in audit log).
  - removed leading alpha character test for usernames (Linux allows it)

0.50  Apr 03, 2009
  - added support for installing SSH keys on OpenVZ 
  - added support for updating User passwords on Linux
  - a section of pod that was inadvertantly being displayed on CPAN web page,
    wrapped in a heredoc instead.
  - 'xm create' doesn't return anything predictable on busy nodes. Instead,
    retry testing to see if the Xen VE has started for up to 15 seconds, 
    waiting for it to start.
  - moved sub install_ssh_key to P:U:User, with calls from P:U:U:Linux,
    P:U:V:L:Xen, and P:U:V:L:OpenVZ.
  - V:Xen now sets the console password as well as the root password
  - updated install_prov_unix. Now installs LWP::UserAgent, instead of failing
    to get the latest P:U version. Will also specify the latest version using
    the CPAN dist syntax.

0.49  Apr 01, 2009
  - bug fix for crypted passwords

0.48  Apr 01, 2009
  - added ssh_key parameter to virtualOS create
  - added xen::set_password
  - added xen::set_fstab
  - passing fatal into more Xen methods to trap and handle errors better
  - made Digest::MD5 a dependency 
  - don't test after deleting a group on Darwin, the system has it cached and
    thus the test to verify deletion fails.
  - fixed command line creation of NicTool domains
  - fixed command line creation of Apache vhosts

0.47  Mar 04, 2009
  - corrected the regexp from =~ to !~ in Win32 platform check

0.46  Mar 03, 2009
  - added fatal => 0 to syscmd calls b/c xm operations don't always
    return valid exit codes. In fact, sometimes they don't ever return.
  - added a timeout. Xm shutdown likes to hang forever. Timeout and try
    an XM destroy. Don't trust the exit status, run a test afterwards
    and see if it succeeded. *sigh*
  - skip system mkdir test on windows
  - check for $user to be set instead of EVAL_ERROR for loading P:U:User

0.45  Feb 17, 2009
  - added fatal => 0 to syscmd calls b/c vzctl operations don't always
    return valid exit codes.
  - return disk results in K and not MB (leave the display units and
    conversions to higher level apps)

0.44  Feb 05, 2009
  - Xen.pm, changed a bunch of $name.vm instances to get_ve_name()
  - OpenVZ, added get_disk_usage
  - Xen, a shutdown VE doesn't show up in 'xm list'. Adjust get_status
    to return a status of 'shutdown' if the VE exists but isn't running
  - OpenVZ, formatted state result value to be consistent with other
    virtualization methods
  - get_status also returns disk usage in results
  - state now reports non-existent and suspended ve's
  - status now reports OS template for openvz nodes
  - added OS reinstall option in OpenVZ.pm

0.43  Feb 02, 2009
  - updated install_prov_unix, run CPAN install if new version detection
    fails.
  - Xen, updated get_status to use get_ve_config_path sub. More reliable
    detection of VE config file.
  - VOS tests clean up test VE at the end of the tests
  - xen 'blocked' state reports as running
  - get_template_dir returns a (true) message if the template dir setting
    isn't defined in provision.conf
  - added ezjail_template_dir = /usr/jails/flavours in provision.conf
  - only test for templates on virt platforms that have them

0.42  Jan 30, 2009
  - vzctl lies. :( In some instances, it will do exactly what you tell it,
    but fail to return an exit code stating such. Thus, we no longer base
    our tests on its result codes but on subsequent test we run.
  - $u->error defaults to print the last error message on the stack when
    called with no message param
  - added template selection based on contents of template cache instead of
    hard coded template names
  - syscmd now traps STDERR output and only displays it if the command failed
  - added a custom create for V:L:Virtuozzo. It requires a
    different invocation for container creation than OpenVZ

0.41  Jan 29, 2009
  - test suites are the most wonderful things! Mine blew up, and
    rightfully so. VirtualOS tests now go find a template in the 
    configured or detected template directory. 
  - A number of xen config file tests were failing because they weren't
    all in sync. moved logic into get_config_file_path which is called 
    from numerous methods.
  - added P:U:V:L:Virtuozzo (inherits OpenVZ)
  - added better error handling and reporting for OpenVZ container
    methods, added DNS server type detection, and better error handling for
    DNS and Web tests when provision.conf isn't configured.

0.40  Jan 23, 2009
  - added P:U:V:S:C->new()
  - updated dependency lists to match what's being used
  - Changed LWP call from decoded_content to content (more compatible with
    older versions of LWP::UserAgent).
  - a few tweaks for Xen container control
  - is_process_running doesn't use a -w on Solaris (unsupported)


0.39  Jan 21, 2009
  - More descriptive error messages when tests are skipped
  - changed #!perl to #!/usr/bin/env perl (hopefully more portable)
  - prov_virtual prints out the result object from $prov invocations
  - lowered min perl version to 5.6 to see what tests blow up
  - print diagnostic info if is_process_running fails
  - updated version of remoteagent
  - added version support to install_deps and Getopt::Long dependency
  - a missing provision.conf is no longer fatal.
