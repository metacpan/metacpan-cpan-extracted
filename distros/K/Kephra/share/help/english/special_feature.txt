      | Special Features of Kephra  |
       -----------------------------

Many standard functions, like opening a file or moving the blinking cursor (that's
called caret), don't need any explanation, or Kephra wouldn't be a good editor. 
Nevertheless there are some functionalities that are very helpful, but are often
overlooked. Maybe because you don't expect them, or they are not in the main menu.
Thatswhy they are listed here, sorted by topic.

 - Text Navigation
    + <Ctrl>+<Shift>+<G> jumps to the position of last change text in the current
    document.
    + <Alt>+<Shift>+<cursor keys> makes a rectangular text selection.
    + brace navigation: <Alt>+<cursor keys> moves the cursor between braces. Up
      and down goes to the matching brace or to the next brace of the same kind.
      Left and right jumps to the previous or next brace of any kind.
    + block navigation: Holding <Alt>, you can jump with <PageUp> and <PageDown>
      block wise. Blocks are junks of lines, separated by empty lines.

 - Text Editing
    + With <Alt>[+<Shift>]+<Z> several changes are undone or redone. Add <Ctrl>,
      and you move to the begin or endpoint of the edit history.
    + <Ctrl>+<W> puts the selected text into the clipboard and vice versa.
    + <Ctrl>+<D> pastes, a copy of the selected text or the current line under
      under the original.
    + move: <Ctrl>+<Alt>+<cursor|page keys> moves the selected text inside the
      document. If nothing is selected, the current line will be moved.
    + edit line wise: Add <Shift> and most simple edit functions will be applied
      to the current line. But <Ctrl>+<Shift>+<L> and <Ctrl>+<Shift>+<R> do only
      apply to line. They delete the left or right part of the cursor.

 - Files
    In this menu is nearly everything self explaining. Even reload or close other
    (all but the visible) are easy to understand, from there positioning in the
    menu. But 2 items should be highlighted.
    + <Alt>+<Shift>+<S> saves current text under a different file name, but the
      document is still associated with the previous file name.
    + <Ctrl>+<Alt>+<Shift>+<S> does save the content and change the file name.

 - View Options
    + The tabbar has many possibilities of configuration.
      * 2 optional icons: one leftmost for a new document and one rightmost to
        close the current document.
      * Right-click calls a context menu with all filenames with the full path.
      * A click with the middle mouse button does the same, but that behavior
        can be changed.
      * A left-click on the highlighted tab switches back to the last used doc.
    + Searchbar is mostly self explaining. All search options are hidden behind
      a left click. And if the cursor is in the search input you can jump between
      all search findings with <Enter> (forward) and <Shift>+<Enter> (backward).
      <Ctrl>+<Enter> jumps to the first and <Ctrl>+<Shift>+<Enter> to the last
      finding. And if you hold <Ctrl> down, you move the text like inside the
      editor with the cursor keys, including <page up> and <page down>, which
      switches between the docs.
    + The status bar shows a lot of recent doc settings, which can be changed
      also via right click and a context menu. A left click switches this property
      on or off. Only exception ist the rightmost panel, which can show different
      infos about the current doc/file.
    + The editor panel has a lot of visual helpers to highlight the current line,
      spaces and tabs or a right margin. But more unusual are indention guides, 
      vertical dotted lines, which can help to recognize indention depths. The
      distance between the indention guides equals the set tab size and they can
      highlight if they connect 2 highlighted braces.

 - Configurations
    + Main or general configs is the internal name for the apps settings.
    + The command list contains all commands a user can give the application.
      * In the first part, every name (ID) gets an internal function (<call>).
        Change that only if you really know what you're doing.
      * The <enable> section gives to some ID a function that determines with a
        positive result, if its currently possible to call the command.
      * <enable_event> should fire, when the result of <enable> changes.
      * <state> function return the command status, e.g. for toolbar switch button.
      * <state_event> triggeres if the <state> changes.
      * <icon> assigns to some calls a filename, containing a bitmap.
      * <key> is the last and maybe most interesting section, because it sets the
        global key binding, that is also displayed (translated) in the main menu.
        Please use here lowercase and English key names only.
    + Menu definitions are just (sometimes nested) lists of commands, and thats
      why very readable. To comment a menu entry out, just append a "#".
    + Localization files contain all labels and short help texts for the commands,
      but also labels to all buttons and dialogs. You can translate the whole app
      by translating this file.
    + Syntax modes holding all the coloring definitions per programming language
      and its keywords. The parsing rules unfortunate.
    + Templates are often used chunks of text, that may contain special variables,
      that will replaced with current data. They are listed in the file menu.
