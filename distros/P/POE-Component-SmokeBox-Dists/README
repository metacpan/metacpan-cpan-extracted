NAME
    POE::Component::SmokeBox::Dists - Search for CPAN distributions by
    cpanid or distribution name

VERSION
    version 1.08

SYNOPSIS
      use strict;
      use warnings;

      use POE;
      use POE::Component::SmokeBox::Dists;

      my $search = '^BINGOS$';

      POE::Session->create(
        package_states => [
                'main' => [qw(_start _results)],
        ],
      );

      $poe_kernel->run();
      exit 0;

      sub _start {
        POE::Component::SmokeBox::Dists->author(
          event => '_results',
          search => $search,
        );
        return;
      }

      sub _results {
        my $ref = $_[ARG0];

        return if $ref->{error}; # Oh dear there was an error

        print $_, "\n" for @{ $ref->{dists} };

        return;
      }

DESCRIPTION
    POE::Component::SmokeBox::Dists is a POE component that provides
    non-blocking CPAN distribution searches. It is a wrapper around
    File::Fetch for "02packages.details.txt.gz" file retrieval, IO::Zlib for
    extraction and CPAN::DistnameInfo for parsing the packages data.

    Given either author ( ie. CPAN ID ) or distribution search criteria,
    expressed as a regular expression, it will return to a requesting
    session all the CPAN distributions that match that pattern.

    The component will retrieve the "02packages.details.txt.gz" file to the
    ".smokebox" directory. If that file already exists, a newer version will
    only be retrieved if the file is older than 6 hours. Specifying the
    "force" parameter overrides this behaviour.

    The "02packages.details.txt.gz" is extracted and a CPAN::DistnameInfo
    object built in order to run the search criteria. This process can take
    a little bit of time.

CONSTRUCTORS
    There are a number of constructors:

    You may also set arbitary keys to pass arbitary data along with your
    request. These must be prefixed with an underscore _.

    "author"
        Initiates an author search. Takes a number of parameters:

          'event', the name of the event to return results to, mandatory;
          'search', a regex pattern to match CPAN IDs against, mandatory;
          'session', specify an alternative session to send results to;
          'force', force the poco to refresh the packages file regardless of age;
          'pkg_time', in seconds before the poco refreshes the packages file, defaults to 6 hours;
          'url', the CPAN mirror url to use, defaults to a built-in list;

    "distro"
        Initiates a distribution search. Takes a number of parameters:

          'event', the name of the event to return results to, mandatory;
          'search', a regex pattern to match distributions against, mandatory;
          'session', specify an alternative session to send results to;
          'force', force the poco to refresh the packages file regardless of age;
          'pkg_time', in seconds before the poco refreshes the packages file, defaults to 6 hours;
          'url', the CPAN mirror url to use, defaults to a built-in list;

    "phalanx"
        Initiates a search for the Phalanx "100" distributions. Takes a
        number of parameters:

          'event', the name of the event to return results to, mandatory;
          'session', specify an alternative session to send results to;
          'force', force the poco to refresh the packages file regardless of age;
          'pkg_time', in seconds before the poco refreshes the packages file, defaults to 6 hours;
          'url', the CPAN mirror url to use, defaults to a built-in list;

    "random"
        Initiates a search for a random 100 CPAN distributions. Takes a
        number of parameters:

          'event', the name of the event to return results to, mandatory;
          'session', specify an alternative session to send results to;
          'force', force the poco to refresh the packages file regardless of age;
          'pkg_time', in seconds before the poco refreshes the packages file, defaults to 6 hours;
          'url', the CPAN mirror url to use, defaults to a built-in list;

    In all the constructors, "session" is only required if the component is
    not spawned from within an existing POE::Session or you wish the results
    event to be sent to an alternative existing POE::Session.

OUTPUT EVENT
    Once the component has finished, retrieving, extracting and processing
    an event will be sent.

    "ARG0" will be a hashref, with the following data:

      'dists', an arrayref consisting of prefixed distributions;
      'error', only present if something went wrong with any of the stages;

ENVIRONMENT
    The component uses the ".smokebox" directory to stash the
    "02packages.details.txt.gz" file.

    This is usually located in the current user's home directory. Setting
    the environment variable "PERL5_SMOKEBOX_DIR" will effect where the
    ".smokebox" directory is located.
