- Add "delayed" to handle dispatch of subrefs.
- POD for delayed.

Mon Feb  9 08:49:53 CST 2015

- Makefile.PL uses module for version.
- Add sanity check for prototype of '::' and words only in 
  trampoline_use.

Thu Jan 22 18:31:59 CST 2015

- 1.40 as string to avoid confusing CPAN indexer.


Fri Jul 26 12:09:17 CDT 2013

- v1.30
- use v5.12.
- drop "use strict" (now built-in).
- Remove regex check on prototype, allows using object to dispatch
  constructor (allows dispatch via factory object).
- Add overrides for UNIVERSAL class methods that dispatch into 
  the AUTOLOAD ($trampoline->isa( X ) or can will return correct
  value).

Tue Jun 12 13:55:35 CDT 2012

- Minor test cleanups.
- use v5.8.

Wed Jul 22 20:13:17 EDT 2009

- Check that the use succeeded in eval.

- Check for a true value of the class on the
  way in and constructor on the way out. 

- Replace "ref" with "blessed" to validate
  object construction.

- Update the tests to use blessed also.

- Added a test for rejecting false classes
  in the initial construction, failure to 
  use the class on bounce.

- Module now depends on Symbol (for testing)
  and Scalar::Util (for operation) also; both
  are core so it shouldn't cause any pain.

Thu Jan 26 17:43:45 EST 2006

- Fixed typo in eval (dbkliv)

- Update pod.

- Code cleanup: redispatching anon sub blows up with wierd
  stack error in 5.8.4; not that much code to duplicate.

Wed Jan 25 16:51:15 EST 2006

- use_class got too klutzy due to issues with bookkeeping
  multiple calling classes. Feh... Added Object::Trampoline::Use
  that does a use in the caller's package to get the object.

- Upated the POD.

Tue Jan 24 18:00:50 EST 2006

- Add add'l argument for using the construcor class 
  ('use_class').

- Update pod to reflect add'l argument.

- Still need to add tests for this; but it at least
  didn't break anything...

Mon Nov 21 17:51:06 EST 2005

- So far so good, up the thing to 1.00, add some 
  more POD::::.

Mon Nov 21 12:55:16 EST 2005

- Replace single $obj->can with if-block that first
  attempts to get a subref then uses $obj->$name in
  order to handle classes whose first non-constructor
  method is an AUTOLOAD.

- Pod, debugging use.

Fri Nov 18 12:53:41 EST 2005

- POD, example of handle catalog module, notes.

Tue Nov  8 14:26:53 EST 2005

- Typos in POD, comments.

- Added comments to 02.t


Tue Nov  1 14:08:06 EST 2005

- Modify Bounce's AUTOLOAD to eval the construction rather
  than croak if it fails. This handles AUTOLOAD-ed constructors
  (which $class->can( $name ) fails on). If you're really
  perverted you can now even use O::T to generate objects of
  type O::T...
