NAME
    Devel::Git::MultiBisect - Study test output over a range of git commits

DESCRIPTION
    Given a Perl library or application kept in git for version control, it
    is often useful to be able to compare the output collected from running
    one or several test files over a range of git commits. If that range is
    sufficiently large, a test may fail in more than one way over that
    range.

    If that is the case, then simply asking, *"When did this file start to
    fail?"* is insufficient. We may want to (a) capture the test output for
    each commit; or, (b) capture the test output only at those commits where
    the output changed. The output of a run of a test file may change for a
    variety of reasons: test failures, segfaults, changes in the number or
    content of tests, etc.)

    Devel::Git::MultiBisect provides methods to achieve that objective. Its
    child classes, Devel::Git::MultiBisect::AllCommits and
    Devel::Git::MultiBisect::Transitions, provide different flavors of that
    functionality for objectives (a) and (b), respectively. Please refer to
    their documentation for further discussion.

PREREQUISITES
    Perl 5.10 or higher.

    Capture::Tiny and IO::CaptureOutput needed for testing only.

    git.

INSTALL
        perl Makefile.PL
        make
        make test
        make install

    If you are on a windows box you should use 'nmake' rather than 'make'.
    (This library has not yet been tested on Windows.)

    Once installed, start reading the documentation by calling:
