     Version 1.10b - September 2nd, 2003

     * Documentation fix for ## vs # in stripComments

     Version 1.10 - September 2nd, 2003

     Version 1.9 - July 24th, 2003

     * Fix for warning for edge case (uninitialized value in chomp)
     * Tests for CRLF

     Version 1.8 - July 11th, 2003

     Version 1.6.1 - June 9th, 2003

     * POD cleanups noticed by Frank Lichtenheld. Thank you, Frank.

     * Cleaned up POD errors

     * Added a line to quash errors with undef hashkeys and writing
     * Fixed the Makefile.PL to straighten up DebControl.pm being in the wrong dir

     Version 1.4 - April 30th, 2003

     * Removed exports as they were unnecessary. Many thanks to pudge, who pointed this out.

     Version 1.3 - April 28th, 2003
