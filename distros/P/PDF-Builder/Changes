3.023     2021-07-15 

    lib/PDF/Builder.pm, INFO/DEPRECATED
     FUTURE: Builder.pm's "default()" method may need to be renamed. 
      Some time after Perl 5.26, Perl::Critic started flagging "default" as a 
      reserved keyword. This needs to be further investigated.

    .github/workflows/test.yml Update PATH for new ImageMagick level.

    lib/PDF/Builder/Resource/XObject/Image/TIFF_GT.pm, t/tiff.t
     Fix for ticket #154 by @carygravel, and add a test for bilevel+alpha
      where rows are not filling out a full array of bytes.

    version (for distribution build), README.md, lib/PDF/Builder.pm,
      t/00-all-usable.t, .gitignore
     Modified to prereq Perl 5.22 instead of 5.20 (is 6 years old now). Also 
      Graphics::TIFF minimum upped to 16 and Image::PNG::Libpng to 0.57 due 
      to changes. Keep files up to date on GitHub so can successfully run 
      without full build. Put "version" in GitHub as it's now fairly involved 
      and I don't want to accidentally lose it!

    Makefile.PL, MANIFEST, META.json (add), META.yml (add), .perl-version 
      (deleted), optional_update.pl (add), README.md
     Modify build process to have optional prereqs properly installed. Also
      ensure that mandatory and optional prereqs are consistently updated and
      handled. Since the vast majority of users will use the default of
      installing all optional prereqs, the selection process has been moved
      from Makefile.PL to optional_update.pl (for those manually running
      Makefile.PL). optional_update.pl updates Makefile.PL, META.json, and
      META.yml upon selection of which (if any) optional prerequisites are to
      be installed on a manual run of Makefile.PL. I don't want to risk 
      getting META.json and META.yml (needed for properly installing the 
      "recommends" optionals) out of sync by failing to update them at install 
      from Makefile.PL, so all are now shipped with all optionals selected.

    .gitattributes, .github/workflows/test.yml
     Added .gitattributes to stop certain line-end changes that were causing 
      CI tests to fail, add Windows tests to CI. From @carygravel.

    lib/PDF/Builder/Content.pm
     Problem with use of "pi" constant caused a warning on compile in one 
      CPAN smoke test (Perl 5.20 for one tester). Changed "-pi" in one
      expression to "-1*pi" and hopefully that will silence the messages.

    lib/PDF/Builder.pm, lib/PDF/Builder/Page.pm, INFO/DEPRECATED, 
      t/annotate-deprecations.t
     Per PDF::API2, simplify Builder's ' fixed' to ' opened'. Rename
      'openpage()' to 'open_page()' and deprecate old name.

    INFO/Changes-ver_2, t/pdf.t
     Per changes in PDF::API2, sync up with 2.040 release. There are still
      a small number of changes not implemented (yet) in PDF::Builder, which
      either appear to be unnecessary, or the underlying code has changed too
      much to cleanly port the changes without a massive rewrite.

    t/deprecations.t
     Update for new PDF::API2 t-tests and a number of other deprecated items.
      Test both deprecated interfaces and their replacements.

    lib/PDF/Builder/Content/Text.pm, examples/BarCode-Boxes-Content-
      ContentText-Rotated.pl, examples/021_synfonts-022_truefonts-
      022_truefonts_diacrits_utf8-023_cjkfonts-024_bdffonts-040_annotation
     Per 3.022 change of lead() to leading(), update examples to use leading() 
      instead of lead().

    In releases 3.020 through 3.022, INFO/DEPRECATED erroneously listed
     PDFStr() and PDFUtf() as being scheduled for removal after October 2022.
     These two routines ARE deprecated (use PDFString() instead), but there
     are currently no plans to REMOVE them.

    .gitignore, lib/PDF/Builder.pm, lib/PDF/Builder/Basic/PDF/File.pm, t/tiff.t
     Some minor cleanup, fix TIFF tests because grouped skips don't seem to
      work properly on Strawberry Perl, initialize $xmin in File.pm to prevent
      error message.

    lib/PDF/Builder/Basic/PDF/Filter/LZWDecode.pm, lib/PDF/Builder.pm,
      lib/PDF/Builder/Resource/XObject/Image/TIFF-TIFF_GT.pm, 
      lib/PDF/Builder/Resource/XObject/Image/TIFF/File-File_GT.pm, 
      t/filter-lzwdecode.t, t/tiff.t, t/00-all-usable.t, Makefile.PL
     Further improvements to TIFF LZW file handling [ref GH 151 and PR 156] for 
      single and multi-strip, and horizontal predictor. Continuation of work
      to stop converting LZW-compressed TIFF to Flate. Code by @carygravel.
      Increase required Graphics::TIFF version to 10 due to fix in GT.

    examples/README, examples/examples.output
     Discuss the issue of close, heavy lines in the example bar codes appearing 
      to merge or "blot" together. This is at least partially a consequence of 
      lower resolution display screens (rounding errors), and although the bars 
      separate when printed, I'm still concerned that they will not be reliably 
      scannable.  

    All files (.pm and .pl) containing $LAST_UPDATE can now access this
      string from outside the file, in the same manner as $VERSION. The
      variable declarator has been changed from 'my' to 'our' during package
      build.

    INFO/Changes-ver_2, /lib/PDF/Builder/Basic/PDF/String.pm, t/string.t
     Per PDF::API2 changes related to [RT 134957], change some regex flags 
      to fix encoding of \n in a PDF string.

    t/tiff.t add version check (not just if installed) for ImageMagick and
      Ghostscript. Some smoke tests apparently blew up for using too low
      level versions. If too low version, or any problems determining the
      version, tiff.t fails gracefully by skipping those tests. From
      @carygravel.

    t/tiff.t use a temporary directory for various test files, enabling use
      from a Read-Only directory and/or running tests in parallel (from
      @ppisar, #153).

3.022     2021-03-27

    docs/buildDoc.pl add "end of page" (###) marker to make it clear that
      you're seeing the bottom of the HTML page.

    Update build process to ensure consistent "unix" formatting of most 
      human-readable files (#150). Some non-CPAN builds were complaining
      about MS-DOS format (CRLF line ends) on some files.

    t/tiff.t, lib/PDF/Builder/Resource/XObject/Image/TIFF-TIFF_GT.pm
     Per #148, update by carygravel to stop converting LZW-compressed TIFFs
      to Flate compression (unnecessary, as PDF directly supports LZW, and 
      there were supposedly some edge-case bugs in the code).
      == REMOVED == still problems, development under way

    t/tiff.t per #143, update by carygravel to enable proper TIFF testing 
      on all platforms including Windows.

    lib/PDF/Builder/Content-Lite.pm, INFO/DEPRECATED, t/content.t
     Per PDF::API2, deprecated lead() and replace by leading(). Lite's
      textlead() deprecated and replaced by textleading().

    t/text.t
     Per PDF::API2 add two tests for charspace and wordspace override, and
     18 more tests for basic text calls. 

    lib/PDF/Builder/Content/Text.pm, INFO/KNOWN_INCOMP
     Per PDF::API2, add paragraphs() as an alias for section(). Document some
      minor inconsistencies in option names and behavior introduced with
      these changes.

    lib/PDF/Builder/Annotation.pm, lib/PDF/Builder/Basic/PDF/Dict-File.pm, 
      lib/PDF/Builder/Resource/Font/SynFont.pm, examples/041_annot_fileattach,
      examples/060_transparency, examples/resources/sample_55.pdf, 
      examples/resources/HarfBuzz_example.pdf
     Output 'endobj' starting its own line. Some PDF validators raise a
      stink if endobj continues a line with other commands on it. 
      While we're at it, put 'stream' starting its own line, too.
      Fix two examples that failed to validate. There is a third failure, but
      it appears to be an issue with PDF/A disallowed content (embedded files),
      not a bug in PDF production here.

    lib/PDF/Builder/Resource/Font/SynFont.pm, INFO/DEPRECATED, 
      examples/025_unifonts, lib/PDF/Builder/Docs.pm
     Fix uninitialized value (missingwidth), remove -slant (deprecated).

    lib/PDF/Builder/Resource/XObject/Image/TIFF.pm
     Corrected some bilevel color inverts.

    lib/PDF/Builder/Resource/XObject/Image/TIFF/File_GT.pm,
      lib/PDF/Builder/Resource/XObject/Image/TIFF_GT.pm
     Some improvements to deal with inverted colors (black/white) on certain
      TIFF images. Now G3 and G4 (CCITT Fax) get flipped to the correct
      colors, as does uncompressed bilevel. There are still some TIFF cases 
      which are not fully properly dealt with; we are still working on them.
     
    lib/PDF/Builder/Annotation.pm, examples/040_annotation, 
      examples/041_annot_fileattach
     Add "-opacity" option to control the opacity (opaqueness) of the icon,
      where the default of 1.0 is fully opaque, and 0.0 is fully transparent.
      Add "markup" method to implement "highlighted" text annotations, per
      [GitHub #142]. These include "Highlight" (in the manner of a highlighter
      marker), "Squiggly" (squiggly underline), "Underline", and "StrikeOut".
      These behave like a "text" annotation, but instead of an icon, the
      document text is highlighted.

    lib/PDF/Builder/Content.pm  improve -strikethru placement

    INFO/LICENSE, README.md, lib/PDF/Builder/Basic/PDF/Array-Bool-Dict-
      File-Filter-Name-Null-Number-Objind-Page-Pages-String-Utils.pm
     Update file headers on code originally written by Martin Hosken to
      reflect that he has granted permission to use the MIT license instead
      of the Perl Artistic License on his code. This change was made so
      that Red Hat could have licensing compatible with LGPL for releasing
      PDF::Builder as part of Fedora.
