NAME
    Geo::Coder::Yahoo - Geocode addresses with the Yahoo! API

SYNOPSIS
    Provides a thin Perl interface to the Yahoo! Geocoding API.

        use Geo::Coder::Yahoo;

        my $geocoder = Geo::Coder::Yahoo->new(appid => 'my_app' );
        my $location = $geocoder->geocode( location => 'Hollywood and Highland, Los Angeles, CA' );

OFFICIAL API DOCUMENTATION
    Read more about the API at
    <http://developer.yahoo.net/maps/rest/V1/geocode.html>.

    Yahoo! says that this API is deprecated and suggest using the
    placefinder API instead. There's a module for that in
    Geo::Coder::Placefinder.

    See also Geo::Coder::Many.

PROXY SETTINGS
    We use the standard proxy setting environment variables via LWP. See the
    LWP documentation for more information.

METHODS
  new
        $geocoder = Geo::Coder::Yahoo->new(appid => $appid)

        $geocoder = Geo::Coder::Yahoo->new(
            appid => $appid,
            on_error => sub { ... },
            ua => LWP::UserAgent->new,
        )

    Instantiates a new object.

    appid specifies your Yahoo Application ID. You can register at
    <http://api.search.yahoo.com/webservices/register_application>.

    If you don't specify it here you must specify it when calling geocode.

    on_error specifies an error handler to be called if the HTTP response
    code does not indicate success. The subroutine is called with the
    geocode object as the first argument and the HTTP::Response object as
    the second. The return value from the subroutine is used as the return
    value from "geocode".

    ua specifies the user agent object to use. If not set then a new
    LWP::UserAgent will be instanciated.

  geocode( location => $location )
    Parameters are the URI arguments documented on the Yahoo API page
    (location, street, city, state, zip). You usually just need one of them
    to get results.

    "geocode" returns a reference to an array of results (an arrayref). More
    than one result may be returned if the given address is ambiguous.

    Each result in the arrayref is a hashref with data like the following
    example:

        {
         'country' => 'US',
         'longitude' => '-118.3387',
         'state' => 'CA',
         'zip' => '90028',
         'city' => 'LOS ANGELES',
         'latitude' => '34.1016',
         'warning' => 'The exact location could not be found, here is the closest match: Hollywood Blvd At N Highland Ave, Los Angeles, CA 90028',
         'address' => 'HOLLYWOOD BLVD AT N HIGHLAND AVE',
         'precision' => 'address'
         }

    precision
        The precision of the address used for geocoding, from specific
        street address all the way up to country, depending on the precision
        of the address that could be extracted. Possible values, from most
        specific to most general are:

        address
        street
        zip+4
        zip+2
        zip
        city
        state
        country

    warning
        If the exact address was not found, the closest available match will
        be noted here.

    latitude
        The latitude of the location.

    longitude
        The longitude of the location.

    address
        Street address of the result, if a specific location could be
        determined.

    city
        City in which the result is located.

    state
        State in which the result is located.

    zip Zip code, if known.

    country
        Country in which the result is located.

  ua
        $ua = $geocoder->ua;

        $geocoder->ua( $new_ua );

    Sets the user agent object to be used, if one is passed. Returns the
    user agent object.
