NAME

    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::WSDL - WSDL to Perl classes when building your
    dist

VERSION

    version 0.208

SYNOPSIS

    In your dist.ini:

        [WSDL]
        uri = http://example.com/path/to/service.wsdl
        prefix = My::Dist::Remote::

DESCRIPTION

    This Dist::Zilla plugin will create classes in your distribution for
    interacting with a web service based on that service's published WSDL
    file. It uses SOAP::WSDL and can optionally add both a class prefix and
    a typemap.

ATTRIBUTES

 uri

    URI (sometimes spelled URL) pointing to the WSDL that will be used to
    generate Perl classes.

 prefix

    String used to prefix generated class names. Default is "My", which
    will result in classes under:

    MyAttributes::

    MyElements::

    MyInterfaces::

    MyServer::

    MyTypes::

    MyTypemaps::

 typemap

    A list of SOAP types and the classes that should be mapped to them.
    Provided because some WSDL files don't always define every type,
    especially fault responses. Listed as a series of => delimited pairs.

    Example:

        typemap = Fault/detail/FooException => MyTypes::FooException
        typemap = Fault/detail/BarException => MyTypes::BarException

 generate_server

    Boolean value on whether to generate CGI server code or just interface
    code. Defaults to false.

METHODS

 before_build

    Instructs SOAP::WSDL to generate Perl classes for the provided WSDL and
    gathers them into the lib directory of your distribution.
