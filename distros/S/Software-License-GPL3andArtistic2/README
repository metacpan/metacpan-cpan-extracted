NAME
    Software::License::GPL3andArtistic2 - GPL 3 and Artistic 2.0 Dual
    License

VERSION
    version 0.07

NOTICE
    This license is probably not needed (IANAL) and unmaintained because the
    Artistic 2.0 Licensed Code can be used in GPL 3 Code and even
    Re-Licensed as it. In this <http://bit.ly/dfBgPn> interview on
    <http://www.theperlreview.com> Allison Randal states (full URI below)

        *Two concepts were added in the Artistic 2.0: relicensing and patent
        protection. The relicensing section 4(c)(ii) means that projects no
        longer need to dual-license with the GPL, because the Artistic
        License itself allows redistribution of the code under the GPL (or
        any "copyleft" license). The patent protection language was added in
        response to the increased patent litigation and threats of patent
        litigation against open source software in the past few years.*

    and

        *Artistic 2.0 is compatible with the GPL version 2 and version 3.
        This is an improvement over Artistic 1.0, which the FSF never
        considered compatible with the GPL. Artistic 2.0 code may also be
        redistributed under the LGPL, MPL or any pure "copyleft" license.*

    so this module is probably not necessary unless you know something else

DESCRIPTION

    Because as of yet Software::License (and Dist::Zilla ) doesn't provide a
    way to multilicense
