NAME
    Catalyst::Plugin::Session::PSGI - minimal configuration access to
    PSGI/Plack session (EXPERIMENTAL)

VERSION
    version 0.0.2

SYNOPSIS
    When running under PSG/Plack with Session middeware enabled you can use
    the PSGI session as follows:

        use Catalyst qw/
            Session
            Session::State::PSGI
            Session::Store::PSGI
        /;

  _psgi_env
    Fetches the psgi env globally from the request env

EXPERIMENTAL
    This distribution should be considered experimental. Although
    functional, it may break in currently undiscovered use cases.

SUMMARY
    If you are running your Catalyst application in a Plack/PSGI environment
    and using Plack::Middleware::Session you might want to consider using
    the session information in the PSGI environment.

    The Catalyst::Plugin::Session::State::PSGI and
    Catalyst::Plugin::Session::Store::PSGI modules access the
    *psgix.session.options* and *psgix.session* data to provide the Catalyst
    session.

AREAS OF CONCERN
    As this is an early, experimental release I thought it only fair to
    share the glaring areas of concern:

    session expiry
        I currently believe that it should be the responsibility of the
        Plack middleware to expire and clear session data. As far as
        possible this functionality is unimplemented and unsupported in this
        distribution.

    session expiry value initialisation
        There was a problem with the session expiry value being unset in the
        Catalyst related code. This led to sessions always being
        deleted/expired and never working properly.

        There are a couple of dubious areas to resolve this.

            sub get_session_data {
                # ...

                # TODO: work out correct place to initialise this
                $psgi_env->{'psgix.session.expires'}
                    ||= $c->get_session_expires;

                # ...
            }

        is almost certainly the wrong time and place to be initialising this
        value, but it works and I'm open to clue-sticks and patches.

            sub get_session_expires {
                my $c = shift;
                my $expires = $c->_session_plugin_config->{expires} || 0;
                return time() + $expires;
            }

        worries me because I have no idea where the value for
        "$c->_session_plugin_config->{expires}" is being initialised. I'm
        concerned that this may become 0 when you least expect it and start
        expiring all sessions.

    (lack of) test coverage
        Other than basic sanity tests provided by Dist::Zilla this
        distribution has no tests!

        I haven't found the time to mock up a plack-catalyst test suite to
        ensure the session is doing the right thing. Once again I'm open to
        clue-sticks and patches.
