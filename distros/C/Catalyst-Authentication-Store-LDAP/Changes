    Both RT#57610, patch and tests by Jason Fried

1.007  19 Mar 2010
   - Store the user password for the ldap_connection method in an inside

   - Pass $c along to find_user method so overridden user_class users can
     get at models (or whatever crazy things they might do) (gphat)

     bad LDAP queries.

     auth system to use ->authenticate instead of ->login, and not say that
     you need to do things manually to have multiple stores. (t0m)

    - Added support for entry_class in the same way that Catalyst::Model::LDAP
      supports it, allowing one to override what class is returned from
