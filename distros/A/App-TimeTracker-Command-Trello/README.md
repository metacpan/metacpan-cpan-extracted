App-TimeTracker-Trello
======================

App::TimeTracker Trello plugin

http://timetracker.plix.at

http://trello.com

Using the Trello plugin, `tracker` can fetch the name of a Card and use
it as the task's description; generate a nicely named `git` branch
(if you're also using the `Git` plugin); add the user as a member to
the Card; move the card to various lists; and use some hackish
extension to the Card name to store the time-worked in the Card.
