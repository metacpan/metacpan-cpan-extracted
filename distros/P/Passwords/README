Passwords
=========

This package provides an easy to use API for the creation and management of
passwords in a secure manner.

This is no new invention and libraries have been existing since a long time to
achieve the same results. Unfortunately they might me easily overseen as they
are hidden in sub-namespaces, are dupes with different results or advocate
outdated algorithms (such as md5/sha1).

The goal of this package is to always offer the de-facto standard algorithm
while using the same namespace + subroutines, though adding subroutines to
ensure compatibility (see password_needs_rehash) with the different versions.
