 Despite the editor is designed to be nonintrusive, every element of the user
 interface has its planned purpose and task. The usage will be easier if you
 know something about but please don't be bored because much of it is common
 knowledge. And if you want to change something just look into the menu "Config".

Mainmenu: 
 Is located topmost at the main window and gives you an overview about
 most available features. To be be able to search features in context it is
 thematically structured with many submenus and subsubmenus and provides a quick
 overview about every feature with information about its keyboard shortcut, its
 representing icon and a short help text in the statusbar. <Ctrl>+<Alt>+<M>
 does toggle its visibility.
 
Toolbar: 
 Is located below the main menu and contains only the icons of the most used 
 functions. That should enable fast work for people who prefer to work with
 the mouse. 

Tabbar:
 shows which files are currently open and if the file is unsaved (*),
 readonly (#) or an activ config file($). Tabs can be selected, moved and closed.
 <Ctrl>+<Alt>+<T> does toggle its visibility.

Context menu: 
 opens with a click of the right mouse button and provides most important 
 functions that stay in connection with the place the menu is called. This
 menus are connected with the edit panel, selected text, left margin, search bar
 and most status panes.
 
Status bar: 
 Is located at the bottom line of the main window. It provides
 informations about the current status and feedback from your instructions.
 Some parts of it are interactive(left-click) and have their own 
 context menu(right-click).
