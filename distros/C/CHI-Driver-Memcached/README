NAME
    CHI::Driver::Memcached -- Distributed cache via memcached (memory cache
    daemon)

VERSION
    version 0.16

SYNOPSIS
        use CHI;

        my $cache = CHI->new(
            driver => 'Memcached',   # or 'Memcached::Fast', or 'Memcached::libmemcached'
            namespace => 'products',
            servers => [ "10.0.0.15:11211", "10.0.0.15:11212", "/var/sock/memcached",
            "10.0.0.17:11211", [ "10.0.0.17:11211", 3 ] ],
            debug => 0,
            compress_threshold => 10_000,
        );

DESCRIPTION
    A CHI driver that uses Cache::Memcached to store data in the specified
    memcached server(s).

    CHI::Driver::Memcached::Fast and CHI::Driver::Memcached::libmemcached
    are also available as part of this distribution. They work with other
    Memcached clients and support a similar feature set. Documentation for
    all three modules is presented below.

CONSTRUCTOR OPTIONS
    Namespace, appended with ":", is passed along to the
    Cached::Memcached::* constructor, along with any constructor options not
    recognized by CHI - for example *servers*, *compress_threshold* and
    *debug*.

    If you need more control over the options passed to Cache::Memcached::*,
    you may specify a hash directly in `memd_params'.

METHODS
    Besides the standard CHI methods:

    memd
        Returns a handle to the underlying Cache::Memcached::* object. You
        can use this to call memcached-specific methods that are not
        supported by the general API, e.g.

            $self->memd->incr("key");
            my $stats = $self->memd->stats();

UNSUPPORTED METHODS
    These standard CHI methods cannot currently be supported by memcached,
    chiefly because there is no way to get a list of stored keys.

    dump_as_hash
    clear
    get_keys
    get_namespaces
    is_empty
    purge
