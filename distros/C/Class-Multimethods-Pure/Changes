0.02  Tue Aug 2 00:00:00 2005
        - internals changes: ripped out the EQUAL method by noticing that

        - added multiple dispatchers support
        - renamed the old default dispatcher DominatingOrder
        - made a new, slow, simple dispatcher called Slow, and made it the default
                because it actually works
        - DominatingOrder is deprecated
        - began work on a new dispatcher

0.06  Sat Aug 6 21:05:00 2005
        - fixed a bug where a subtype would not be considered a subset of its parent

        - Added a new multi core called DumbCache, did some minor maintenance.

0.10  Mon Sep 19 23:09:00 2005
        - Rejigged the registration process to be much more pluggable.  Now you just
          have to specify your own registry like $REGISTRY if you're doing anything
          at all reasonable in your extension.

0.11  Tue Sep 20 01:18:00 2005
        - Fixed a major minor bug that surfaced itself in Symbol::Opaque where
          if you imported a multimethod before (in control flow sense) you
          defined it, the import wouldn't work.

0.12  Set Feb 3 12:58:00 2007
        - Added a fast DecisionTree core.  Fixed some documentation bugs.

0.13  Sun Feb 4 00:12:00 2007
        - A few documentation fixes.
