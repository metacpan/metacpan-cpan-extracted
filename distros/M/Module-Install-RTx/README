NAME
    Module::Install::RTx - RT extension installer

SYNOPSIS
    In the Makefile.PL of the "RT-Extension-Example" module:

        use inc::Module::Install;
        RTx 'RT-Extension-Example';

        requires_rt '4.2.0';
        rt_too_new  '4.4.0';

        WriteAll();

DESCRIPTION
    This Module::Install extension implements several functions for
    installing RT extensions:

  RTx '*extension name*'
    This function arranges for the following directories to be installed, if
    they exist (assuming "RTx('RT-Extension-Example')"):

        ./bin    => $RT::LocalPluginPath/RT-Extension-Example/bin
        ./etc    => $RT::LocalPluginPath/RT-Extension-Example/etc
        ./html   => $RT::LocalPluginPath/RT-Extension-Example/html
        ./lib    => $RT::LocalPluginPath/RT-Extension-Example/lib
        ./po     => $RT::LocalPluginPath/RT-Extension-Example/po
        ./sbin   => $RT::LocalPluginPath/RT-Extension-Example/sbin
        ./static => $RT::LocalPluginPath/RT-Extension-Example/static
        ./var    => $RT::LocalPluginPath/RT-Extension-Example/var

    Accepts an optional argument hashref after the extension name with two
    possible keys

  deprecated_rt
        If set to a true value, skips the enforced RT-4.0.0 minimum version check

        You should set a perl_version if using this option and requires_rt(), because requires_rt
        only handles figuring our what perl you need if you're on RT 4.0.0 or higher.

  no_readme_generation
        If set to a true value, will not call readme_from on the extension's primary perl module.

  requires_rt *version*
    Takes one argument, a valid RT version. If an attempt is made to install
    on an RT than that version, it will die before Makefile creation.

  requires_rt_plugin *RT::Extension::Example* [, *version*]
    Ensures that the given RT extension (and optional version) is installed
    in the target RT instance; "requires" cannot be used because RT
    extensions are not in @INC.

  rt_too_new *version* [, *message*]
    Takes one argument, a valid RT version, and prevents this module from
    being installed on any version of RT equal to or newer than that. Useful
    if a particular release of an extension only works on 4.0.x but not
    4.2.x.

    Takes an optional second argument which allows you to specify a custom
    error message. This message is passed to sprintf with two string
    arguments, the current RT version and the version you specify.

  remove_files
    If set to a true value, during installation any files listed in a
    "remove_files" file will be removed from the destination directories.
    This feature is for removing files that have been deleted or moved in
    the current version and leaving the old version in place when upgrading
    can cause problems.

    RTx looks for a "remove_files" file in the etc/upgrade directory of the
    distribution. The format of the "remove_files" file is as follows:

        package Module::Install::RTx;

        @remove_files = qw(
        html/dir/file_to_remove
        );
        1;

    The file locations are relative to the distribution. The destination
    directory prefix is added automatically.

CAVEATS
    *   Us the full name when calling RTx method in Makefile.PL; while
        "RTx('Foo')" was once supported, it is no longer.

ENVIRONMENT
    RTHOME
        Path to the RT installation that contains a valid lib/RT.pm.

EXAMPLES
    To install an extension which makes use of this installer:

        perl Makefile.PL RTHOME=/opt/rt4

    This will install all subdirs into the $RT::LocalPluginPath dir as
    configured in RT::Generated.

    To install an extension into the (vendor) plugin path:

        perl Makefile.PL RTHOME=/opt/rt4 INSTALLDIRS=vendor

    This will install all subdirs into the $RT::PluginPath which is
    specifically meant for plugins that are installed through other
    packaging utils like APT or RPM.
