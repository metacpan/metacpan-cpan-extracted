This is the README for Lingua::JA::FindDates version 0.028.

Lingua::JA::FindDates is a "module" for the Perl computer programming
language, a library of computer code to install on a computer.  This
document contains four sections:

1. About - what the module does

2. Documentation - how to learn more about the module

3. Installation - how to install this module on a computer

4. Help - what to do if you get stuck

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. ABOUT

Lingua::JA::FindDates - scan text to find dates in a Japanese format

This is an aid for translating documents in Japanese. This module's
main routine, "subsjdate", scans a text and finds things which
appear to be Japanese dates.

The module recognizes a variety of date formats. It recognizes the
typical format of dates with the year first, followed by the month,
then the day, such as 平成20年七月十日 "(Heisei nijūnen shichigatsu
tōka)". It also recognizes combinations such as years alone, years and
months, a month and day without a year, fiscal years (年度, "nendo"),
parts of the month, like 中旬 ("chūjun", the middle of the month),
and periods between two dates.

The module recognizes both Japanese years, such as "平成２４年"
(Heisei), and European years, such as 2012年. It recognizes ASCII
numerals, 1, 2, 3; the "wide" or "double width" numerals sometimes
used in Japan, １, ２, ３ (see
"What is "wide ASCII"?"); 
and the kanji-based numeral system, 一, 二,三. It recognizes some
special date formats such as 元年 for the first year of an era. It
recognizes era names identified by their initial letters, such as S41
年 for Shōwa 41 (1966). It recognizes dates regardless of spacing
between characters, such as "平 成 二 十 年 八 月".

The input text must be marked as Unicode, in other words character
data, not byte data.

The module has been tested on several hundreds of documents, and it
should cope with all common Japanese dates. If you find that it cannot
identify some kind of date within Japanese text, please report a bug.
