  0.7 August 2008 - NON CPAN RELEASE
  - SSL traffic was being sent to port 80/http on the destination server. 
    This has been corrected, and any traffic inside a MITM'd CONNECT method 
    will be sent to 443 by default (or what the user specifies), and requests
    are forced to be HTTPs.

  0.6 Auguest 2008 - NON CPAN RELEASE
  - Add proxying of SSL traffic via MITM.

  0.5 July 2008 - NON CPAN RELEASE
  - Add an upstream_proxy flag to the configuration, which, if present, is the
    hostname and port number of the upstream proxy server to use.
  - Add script to pack to a .exe on Win32

  0.3 July 2008 - NON CPAN RELEASE
  - Change mime type detection to just use the file extension of the file 
    being served from local disk (rather than magic). Windows doesn't have
    a magic file...
  - Eliminate a bug when you map a specific file, local disk path was getting 
    / appended, this is now removed.
  - Fix a bug which sometimes caused partial content to be served.
  - Insist on new HTTP::Headers, as we need it's ->if_modified_since method
    to return an epochtime.
  - Shake on a little binmode sauce, to make Windows play nicely when serving
    binary files.

  0.2 July 2008 - NON CPAN RELEASE
    - Fixed t/03_pod_coverage.t - I'd ripped this off from another one of my modules, and it still had references to that module,
      and therefore didn't work without this module installed.
    - Added relevant requires, so that the HTTP::Proxy::Engine classes get
      bundled with the script.
    - Change packing instructions so that we don't pack just the .par

  0.1 July 2008 - NON CPAN RELEASE
    - Initial version
