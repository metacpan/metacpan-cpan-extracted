=head1 NAME

KinoSearch::Index::DataWriter - Write data to an index.

=head1 DEPRECATED

The KinoSearch code base has been assimilated by the Apache L<Lucy> project.
The "KinoSearch" namespace has been deprecated, but development continues
under our new name at our new home: L<http://lucy.apache.org/>

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    # Abstract base class.



=head1 DESCRIPTION

DataWriter is an abstract base class for writing index data, generally in
segment-sized chunks. Each component of an index -- e.g. stored fields,
lexicon, postings, deletions -- is represented by a
DataWriter/L<DataReader|KinoSearch::Index::DataReader> pair.

Components may be specified per index by subclassing
L<Architecture|KinoSearch::Plan::Architecture>.

=head1 CONSTRUCTORS

=head2 new( I<[labeled params]> )

    my $writer = MyDataWriter->new(
        snapshot   => $snapshot,      # required
        segment    => $segment,       # required
        polyreader => $polyreader,    # required
    );

=over

=item *

B<snapshot> - The Snapshot that will be committed at the end of the
indexing session.

=item *

B<segment> - The Segment in progress.

=item *

B<polyreader> - A PolyReader representing all existing data in the
index.  (If the index is brand new, the PolyReader will have no
sub-readers).

=back



=head1 ABSTRACT METHODS

=head2 add_inverted_doc( I<[labeled params]> )

Process a document, previously inverted by C<< inverter >>.

=over

=item *

B<inverter> - An Inverter wrapping an inverted document.

=item *

B<doc_id> - Internal number assigned to this document within the
segment.

=back

=head2 add_segment( I<[labeled params]> )

Add content from an existing segment into the one currently being
written.

=over

=item *

B<reader> - The SegReader containing content to add.

=item *

B<doc_map> - An array of integers mapping old document ids to
new.  Deleted documents are mapped to 0, indicating that they should be
skipped.

=back

=head2 finish()

Complete the segment: close all streams, store metadata, etc.

=head2 format()

Every writer must specify a file format revision number, which should
increment each time the format changes. Responsibility for revision
checking is left to the companion DataReader.



=head1 METHODS

=head2 delete_segment(reader)

Remove a segment's data.  The default implementation is a no-op, as
all files within the segment directory will be automatically deleted.
Subclasses which manage their own files outside of the segment system
should override this method and use it as a trigger for cleaning up
obsolete data.

=over

=item *

B<reader> - The SegReader containing content to merge, which must
represent a segment which is part of the the current snapshot.

=back

=head2 merge_segment( I<[labeled params]> )

Move content from an existing segment into the one currently being
written.

The default implementation calls add_segment() then delete_segment().

=over

=item *

B<reader> - The SegReader containing content to merge, which must
represent a segment which is part of the the current snapshot.

=item *

B<doc_map> - An array of integers mapping old document ids to
new.  Deleted documents are mapped to 0, indicating that they should be
skipped.

=back

=head2 metadata()

Arbitrary metadata to be serialized and stored by the Segment.  The
default implementation supplies a Hash with a single key-value pair for
"format".

=head2 get_snapshot()

Accessor for "snapshot" member var.

=head2 get_segment()

=head2 get_polyreader()

Accessor for "polyreader" member var.

=head2 get_schema()

Accessor for "schema" member var.
