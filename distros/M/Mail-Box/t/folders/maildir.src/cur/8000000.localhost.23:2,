You can convert .html to .ps using Netscape.  You can do this manually
by clicking mouse, or through '-remote' command line option.  For
example,
    netscape -remote "openURL(http://sexybabes.for.you/)" \
	     -remote "saveAs(xxx.ps, Postscript)"

You can then convert .ps to .tiff like FAX program does.
