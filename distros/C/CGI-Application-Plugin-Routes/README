CGI-Application-Plugin-Routes

The README is used to introduce the module and provide instructions on
how to install the module, any machine dependencies it may have (for
example C compilers and installed libraries) and any other information
that should be provided before the module is installed.

A README file is required for CPAN modules since CPAN extracts the README
file from a module distribution so that people browsing the archive
can use it to get an idea of the module's uses. It is usually a good idea
to provide version information here so that people can decide whether
fixes for the module are worth downloading.


INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install

SYNOPSIS

CGI::Application::Plugin::Routes tries to bring to perl some of the goodies of Rails routes by allowing the creationg of a routes table that is parsed at the prerun stage again the CGI's path_info data. The result of the process (if there's any match at the end of the process) is added to CGI's query method from CGI::Application and available to all the runmodes via the CGI::Application::query::param method.
By doing this, the plugin provides a uniform way to access GET and POST parameters when using clean url's with the query->param() method.


USAGE

Perhaps a little code snippet.

In TestApp.om

	package TestApp;
	use strict;
	use warnings;
	use base qw/CGI::Application/;
	use CGI::Application::Plugin::Routes;
	sub setup {
		my $self = shift;

		$self->routes_root('/thismod');#optional, will be used to prepend every route defines in $self->routes.
		$self->routes([
			'' => 'home' ,
			'/view/:name/:id/:email'  => 'view',
		]);
		$self->start_mode('show');

		$self->tmpl_path('templates/');
	}
	sub view {
		my $self = shift;
		my $q = $self->query();
		my $name = $q->param('name');
		my $id = $q->param('id');
		my $email = $q->param('email');
		my $debug = $self->routes_dbg; #dumps all the C::A::P::Routes info
		return $self->dump_html();
	}
	1;

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

Michael Peter's CGI::Application::Dispatch module that can be found here:
http://search.cpan.org/~wonko/CGI-Application-Dispatch
I borrowed from him most of the routine that parses the url.

Mark Stosberg http://search.cpan.org/~markstos/  provided great feedback and fixed parts of the code making it more clean and efficient.
