DESCRIPTION

    This distribution provides several implementations of tree classes (and
    class generators) which you can use directly or as a base class. All of
    them consume the roles from Role::TinyCommons::Tree distribution.

    Provided classes:

    # INSERT_MODULES_LIST -Tree::ObjectXS

    The modules are just like their counterpart in the Tree::ObjectXS
    distribution, except that XS optimized modules/codes are used. The
    modules are separated into this distribution because they depend on XS
    modules.
