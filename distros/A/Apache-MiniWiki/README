NAME
    Apache::MiniWiki - Miniature Wiki for Apache

DESCRIPTION
    Apache::MiniWiki is a simplistic Wiki for Apache. It doesn't have much
    uses besides very simple installations where hardly any features are
    needed. What is does support though is:

      - storage of Wiki pages in RCS
      - templates through HTML::Template
      - text to HTML conversion with HTML::FromText
      - basic authentication password changes
      - uploading of binary (pdf, doc, gz, zip, ps)
      - uploading of images (jpg, jpeg, gif, png)
      - automatic thumbnailing of large using ImageMagick
      - sub directories
      - view any revision of a page
      - revert back to any revision of the page
      - basic checks to keep search engine spiders from deleting 
        all the pages in the Wiki

DEPENDENCIES
    This module requires these other modules:

      Apache::Htpasswd
      Apache::Constants
      CGI
      Date::Manip
      Image::Magick (Optional)
      HTML::FromText
      HTML::Template
      Rcs

SYNOPSIS
    Add this to httpd.conf:

      <Location /wiki>
         PerlAddVar datadir "/home/foo/db/wiki/"
         PerlAddVar vroot "/wiki"
         SetHandler perl-script
         PerlHandler Apache::MiniWiki
      </Location>

AUTHENTICATION EXAMPLES
      Require a password to read/write any page:
  
      <Location /wiki>
         PerlAddVar datadir "/home/foo/db/wiki/"
         PerlAddVar vroot "/wiki"
         PerlAddVar authen "/home/foo/db/htpasswd"
         SetHandler perl-script
         PerlHandler Apache::MiniWiki

         AuthType Basic
         AuthName "Sample Wiki"
         AuthUserFile /home/foo/db/htpasswd 
         Require valid-user
      </Location>

      Public can read, but need password to edit/save/revert a page:
  
      <Location /wiki>
         PerlAddVar datadir "/home/foo/db/wiki/"
         PerlAddVar vroot "/wiki"
         PerlAddVar authen "/home/foo/db/htpasswd"
         SetHandler perl-script
         PerlHandler Apache::MiniWiki

         Require valid-user # or group foo or whatever you want
         PerlAccessHandler Apache::MiniWiki::access_handler

         AuthType Basic
         AuthName "Sample Wiki"
         AuthUserFile /home/foo/db/htpasswd 
         Require valid-user
      </Location>

USE AS A CGI SCRIPT
    Apache::MiniWiki can also be called by an Apache::Registry CGI script.
    By running it in this manner, absolutely no changes need to be made to
    the web server's httpd.conf, as long as Apache has mod_perl built in,
    and the Apache::Registry (or a module that emulates it) is available.

    Copy the example wiki.cgi into your CGI directory and assign it the
    appropriate permissions. Edit wiki.cgi and add the required options,
    such as the datadir and vroot variables:

     $r->dir_config->add(datadir => '/home/foo/db/wiki/');
     $r->dir_config->add(vroot => '/perlcgi/wiki.cgi');

    Note #1: This may be a great way of integrating Apache::MiniWiki into an
    existing site that already has it's own header/footer template system.

    Note #2: This method assumes that the site administrator is already
    using Apache::Registry to speed up CGI's on the site. If they aren't,
    have them set up mod_perl as it was meant to be. See the mod_perl guide,
    or try this:

      ScriptAlias /perlcgi /path/to/your/cgi-bin/
      <Location /perlcgi>
        SetHandler perl-script
        PerlHandler Apache::Registry
        Options ExecCGI
      </Location>

CONFIGURATION
    If you want to use your own template for MiniWiki, you should place the
    template in the RCS file template,v in the "datadir". Upon execution,
    MiniWiki will check out this template and use it. If you make any
    modifications to the RCS file, a new version will be checked out.

    You can modify the template from within MiniWiki by visiting the URL
    http://your.server.name/your-wiki-vroot/(edit)/template

    If you don't install a template, a default one will be used.

    The "datadir" variable defines where in the filesystem that the RCS
    files that MiniWiki uses should be stored. This is also where MiniWiki
    looks for a template to use.

    The "vroot" should match the virtual directory that MiniWiki runs under.

    If this variable is set, it should point to a standard htpasswd file
    which MiniWiki has write access to. The function to change a users
    password is then enabled.

    (Optional) The default timezone is GMT-8 (PST). To change to a different
    timezone, use the "timediff" variable. Eg, to change to Amsterdam /
    Rome:

      PerlAddVar timediff 1

    (Optional) By default, only the template called template is used. This
    becomes the default template for every page. Use the "templates"
    variable to specify more then one template:

      PerlAddVar templates fvlug linux

    By doing this, pages that contain those words will use the matching
    template. For example, the /your-wiki-vroot/LinuxDatabases page will
    then use the template-linux page, instead of template. You will need to
    create the template by going to
    /wiki/your-wiki-vroot/(edit)/template-<the_template> first.

    (Optional) To disable file uploads such as binary attachments and inline
    images, set uploads to no. By default it is yes. Note that inline images
    requires the Image::Magick module to be installed for generating
    thumbnails.

      PerlAddVar uploads no

    (Optional) Pre-caching can be done by a periodic (eg every 5 minutes)
    cronjob to refresh the cached version of the .list* pages (see below) in
    the background, rather then when Apache::Miniki discovers that the cache
    is old when a request is done. To eanble:

      PerlAddVar precaching yes

    If you create the pages 'list' or 'listchanges' or 'listlinks', the
    following will automatically get appended to them:

     - list:        A simple line deliminated list of 
                    all the pages in the system

     - listchanges: Ordered by date, gives a list of all pages 
                    including the last comment, the number of lines 
                    added or removed, and the date of the last change

     - listlinks:   Creates a list of all the inner/outer HTML links on the site,
                    grouped by page name. By using CSS and some JavaScript in your
                                    template, it can become very easy to navigate around this way.

    The master 'template' page does not show up in any of these three page
    listings.

MULTIPLE WIKIS
    Multiple wiki sites can easily be run on the same server. This can be
    done by setting up multiple <Location> sections in the httpd.conf, with
    the appropriate settings.

    For an example of automating this using perl, see
    conf/httpd-perl-startup.pl in the MiniWiki distribution for a sample
    mod_perl startup file.

TEMPLATE VARIABLES
    These variables are passed by Apache::MiniWiki to HTML::Template:

      vroot:
        virtual root of the wiki installation. E.g.
              /wiki
      title:
        the title of a page. Comes from the first line of text.
      body:
        HTMLified version of a wiki page
      editlink:
        Link to the edit page. E.g.:
              http://www.nyetwork.org/wiki/(edit)/MiniWiki
      loglink:
        Link to the Archive page. e.g.:
              http://www.nyetwork.org/wiki/(log)/MiniWiki
      pageurl:
        Fully qualified link to the page based on the last request, e.g.:
              http://nyetwork.org:80/wiki/MiniWiki
      lastmod:
        date the page was last changed, e.g.:
              March 18, 2003 4:25 PM

SEARCH ENGINES
    Spiders for search engines (Google, OpenFind, etc) love the bounty of
    links found in a Wiki. Unfortunely, they also follow the Archive,
    Changes, View, and Revert links. This not only adds to the load on your
    webserver, but there is a very high chance that pages will get rolled
    back as the spider goes in circles following links. This has happened!
    Add these links to your robots.txt so that robots can only view the
    actual current pages:

    Disallow: /wiki/(edit)/ Disallow: /wiki/(log)/ Disallow: /wiki/(revert)/
    Disallow: /wiki/(save)/ Disallow: /wiki/(view)/ Disallow:
    /wiki/lastchanges

    See http://www.nyetwork.org/wiki for an example of this module in active
    use.
