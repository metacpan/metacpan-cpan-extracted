NAME
    MooX::Role::Logger - Provide logging via Log::Any

VERSION
    version 0.005

SYNOPSIS
    In your modules:

        package MyModule;
        use Moose;
        with 'MooX::Role::Logger';

        sub run {
            my ($self) = @_;
            $self->cry;
        }

        sub cry {
            my ($self) = @_;
            $self->_logger->info("I'm sad");
        }

    In your application:

        use MyModule;
        use Log::Any::Adapter ('File', '/path/to/file.log');

        MyModule->run;

DESCRIPTION
    This role provides universal logging via Log::Any. The class using this
    role doesn't need to know or care about the details of log
    configuration, implementation or destination.

    Use it when you want your module to offer logging capabilities, but
    don't know who is going to use your module or what kind of logging they
    will implement. This role lets you do your part and leaves actual log
    setup and routing to someone else.

    The application that ultimately uses your module can then choose to
    direct log messages somewhere based on its own needs and configuration
    with Log::Any::Adapter.

    This role is based on Moo so it should work with either Moo or Moose
    based classes.

USAGE
  Testing
    Testing with Log::Any is pretty easy, thanks to Log::Any::Test. Just
    load that before Log::Any loads and your log messages get sent to a test
    adapter that includes testing methods:

        use Test::More 0.96;
        use Log::Any::Test;
        use Log::Any qw/$log/;

        use lib 't/lib';
        use MyModule;

        MyModule->new->cry;
        $log->contains_ok( qr/I'm sad/, "got log message" );

        done_testing;

  Customizing
    If you have a whole set of classes that should log with a single
    category, create your own role and set the "_build__logger_category"
    there:

        package MyLibrary::Role::Logger;
        use Moo::Role;
        with 'MooX::Role::Logger';

        sub _build__logger_category { "MyLibrary" }

    Then in your other classes, use your custom role:

        package MyLibrary::Foo;
        use Moo;
        with 'MyLibrary::Role::Logger'

METHODS
  _logger
    Returns a logging object. See Log::Any for a list of logging methods it
    accepts.

  _build__logger_category
    Override to set the category used for logging. Defaults to the class
    name of the object (which could be a subclass). You can override to lock
    it to a particular name:

        sub _build__logger_category { __PACKAGE__ }

SEE ALSO
    Since MooX::Role::Logger is universal, you have to use it with one of
    several Log::Any::Adapter classes:

    *   Log::Any::Adapter::File

    *   Log::Any::Adapter::Stderr

    *   Log::Any::Adapter::Stdout

    *   Log::Any::Adapter::ScreenColoredLevel

    *   Log::Any::Adapter::Dispatch

    *   Log::Any::Adapter::Syslog

    *   Log::Any::Adapter::Log4perl

    These other logging roles are specific to particular logging packages,
    rather than being universal:

    *   MooseX::LazyLogDispatch

    *   MooseX::Log::Log4perl

    *   MooseX::LogDispatch

    *   MooseX::Role::LogHandler

    *   MooseX::Role::Loggable (uses Log::Dispatchouli)

    *   Role::Log::Syslog::Fast
