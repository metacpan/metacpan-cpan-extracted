SYNOPSIS
     use Ham::Reference::Phonetics;

     my $phonetics = Ham::Reference::Phonetics->new(
            space => '<space>'
     );

     # use the get() function to get a string of phonetics

     print $phonetics->get('abc xyz');
     print "\n";

     # use the get_array() function to get an array of phonetics
     # with each one in an element

     my $arrayref = $phonetics->get_arrayref('abc xyz');
     foreach (@$arrayref) {
            print "$_\n";
     }

     # use a hash reference to get all phonetics
     # the following will display all letters and corresponding phonetics

     my $hashref = $phonetics->get_hashref();
     foreach (sort keys %$hashref)
     {
            print "$_ = $hashref->{$_}\n";
     }

DESCRIPTION
    The "Ham::Reference::Phonetics" module is a quick reference to the ITU
    phonetic alphabet suggested by the ARRL for Amateur Radio use. Other
    phonetic alphabets may be included in the future. Some can already be
    found in "Lingua::Alphabet::Phonetic".

CONSTRUCTOR
  new()
     Usage    : my $phonetics = Ham::Reference::Phonetics->new();
     Function : creates a new Ham::Reference::Phonetics object
     Returns  : A Ham::Reference::Phonetics object
     Args     : an anonymous hash:
                key           required?   value
                -------       ---------   -----
                phonetic_set  no          select the phonetic alphabet set
                                          the only set for now, and the default set
                                          is itu
                space         no          set a string to represent a space when
                                          using methods to convert to phonetics
                                          default is an empty string

METHODS
  get()
     Usage    : my $string = $phonetics->get( 'this is my string' );
     Function : converts a string to a string of corresponding phonetic words
     Returns  : a string
     Args     : a string

  get_arrayref()
     Usage    : my $arrayref = $phonetics->get_arrayref( 'this is my string' );
     Function : converts a string to an array reference of corresponding phonetic words
                one phonetic word per element
     Returns  : an array reference
     Args     : a string

  get_hashref()
     Usage    : my $hashref = $phonetics->get_hashref();
     Function : get the phonetic alphabet in a hash referenece
     Returns  : a hash reference
     Args     : n/a
