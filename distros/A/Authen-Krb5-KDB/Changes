	Release 0.09

2002/10/10 by <steiner@bakerst.rutgers.edu> (Dave Steiner)

	t/princ-check.pl
	- Don't hardcode date to a specific timezone; call localtime
	and strftime within test

2002/10/09 by <steiner@bakerst.rutgers.edu> (Dave Steiner)

	Release 0.08

2002/10/09 by <steiner@bakerst.rutgers.edu> (Dave Steiner)

	Makefile.PL
	- handle newer version of MakeMaker (from v5.8.0): The target
	for creating KDB.pm now uses $(PERLRUNINST) instead of $(PERL).

2002/09/02 by <steiner@bakerst.rutgers.edu> (Dave Steiner)

	gen_dummy_kdb_pm.plx (MANIFEST)
	- generate d/KDB.pm from KDB.in
	Makefile.PL
	- make sure d/KDB.pm is generated and part of the distfile
	KDB.in
	- keep the filehandle in our object and use that for other methods.

2002/08/29 by <steiner@bakerst.rutgers.edu> (Dave Steiner)

	Release 0.07

2002/08/29 by <steiner@bakerst.rutgers.edu> (Dave Steiner)

	d/KDB.pm (MANIFEST)
	- new dummy file so CPAN can find the pod and VERSION for this
	  .pm file.

2002/05/06 by <steiner@td.rutgers.edu> (Dave Steiner)

	KDB/Key.pm
	- Make sure we get the correct CORE::length function where needed.
	- Change 'data_counter' field in the object to '_data_cntr'.

	KDB/TL.pm
	- Make sure we get the correct CORE::length function where needed.

2002/04/22 by <steiner@td.rutgers.edu> (Dave Steiner)

	Release 0.06

2002/04/19 by <steiner@td.rutgers.edu> (Dave Steiner)

	Makefile.PL; KDB_pm.PL
	- new versions of MakeMaker.pm will give any .PL files the
	  target as their first argument.  KDB_pm.PL will use this if
	  given.  To allow this to work, we now put KDB5_UTIL_PATH=
	  before our path argument.

2002/04/18-19 by <steiner@td.rutgers.edu> (Dave Steiner)

	gen_kdb_h.plx
	- Save the distributed KDB_H.pm file as KDB_H.pm.dist if we
	  haven't done so already.

2002/04/18 by <steiner@td.rutgers.edu> (Dave Steiner)

	Makefile.PL
	- finish code to support generation of KDB.pm by KDB_pm.PL
	  from KDB.in.

2002/04/17 by <steiner@td.rutgers.edu> (Dave Steiner)

	KDB/V3.pm
	- add get_attributes method (load :Attributes from KDB_H.pm).
	- use get_attributes in print_principal method.

	KDB/V3.pm; KDB/V4.pm; KDB/V5.pm
	- add documentation for the print_principal, get_attributes, and
	  print_policy methods.

	KDB.pm, KDB.in; Makefile.PL; KDB_pm.PL
	- KDB.pm is now generated by the KDB_pm.PL script which is
	  called during 'perl Makefile.PL'.  KDB.in is now the file to
	  edit.  Moved hard-coded path to kdb5_util to variable and
	  KDB_pm.PL will patch this to include the correct path.
	  To use a non-standard path run something like
	  'perl Makefile.PL KDB5_UTIL_PATH=/usr/local/krb5/sbin'.
	  The default is '/usr/local/sbin'.

2002/04/16 by <steiner@td.rutgers.edu> (Dave Steiner)

	t/v3.t
	- moved checks for principals to t/princ-check.pl

	t/v4.t; t/v5.t
	- explicitly set 'checks' to 1 iff they haven't been set already.
	  This allows us to be loaded from elsewhere with a different
	  check level.
	- moved checks for principals to t/princ-check.pl

	t/princ-check.pl
	- moved all similar code (from v3-5) to check principals to
	  this file.  Now we can just require this file and call a function.
	- added tests for attributes; tl, key and e data

	t/v3-l2.t
	- add 'use vars' so we don't get "used only once" warning

	t/v4-l2.t; t/v5-l2.t
	- new test files.  set 'checks' to 2 and then "require t/vN.t"
	  for N=4 or 5

	KDB/V3.pm; KDB/V4.pm; KDB/TL.pm; KDB/Key.pm
	- finish level 2 checks

	KDB.pm
	- add better description

2002/04/12 by <steiner@td.rutgers.edu> (Dave Steiner)

	t/v3-l2.t
	- new test file.  set 'checks' to 2 and then "require t/v3.t"

	t/v3.t
	- explicitly set 'checks' to 1 iff they haven't been set already.
	  This allows us to be loaded from elsewhere with a different
	  check level.
