0.20  Wed Aug 15 21:22:41 2001
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.20 with options
		-X -n Parse::Nibbler


0.21	Mon Aug 27 20:00:00 2001
		- fixed make test, added a use lib statement
			and added a link in t/ directory
		- added copyright/license to README file.

0.22	Tue Aug 28 2001
		- added link to VerilogGrammar.pm in top directory.

0.23	Tue Aug 28 2001
		- put use base module name in quotes, in VerilogGrammar.pm


1.00	Tue Oct 15 2001
		- Major rewrite
		- interface is much easier to use.
		- do not require a separate package for each rule.
		- subroutine name is name of rule.
		- added a lexer which gets rid of a window of text.
		- now lex the file once, and then process lexicals after that.
		- Still in alpha stages

1.01	Thu Oct 18 2001
		- stripped out all references to End Of File error checks.
		- want to eventually rewrite EOF handling.
		- error messages are now tagged so that they can be
			distinguished from normal Perl errors.

1.02	

1.03	Sun Oct 21, 2001
		- In verilog grammar, add 'Number' rule to list of 
			alternates that can connect to port.
		- tried a couple of tweaks to speed up overall code.

1.04	Tue Oct 23 2001
		- verilog grammar needs to accept underscore as a 
			valid leading character for identifiers.


1.05	Wed Oct 31 2001
		- speed improvements
		- Register now installs two subroutines
		-	one that handles arguments (quantifier, separator)
		-	and one that doesn't take any arguments (faster)
		- big_verilog.t benchmarks at 650 lines per second.
		- include a rough draft of a profiler package

1.06	Wed Oct 31 2001
		- minor speed improvements (750 lines per second)


1.07	Thur Nov 1 2001
		- added Peek functionality which prevents a rule 
		-	from being called if Peek can determine it will fail.
		- Peek gives a major speed bonus.
		- Now parsing ~1025 lines per second
		- removed multiple flavors of rule 
		-	(rule, rule_args, rule_save, rule_save_args)
		-	was getting a minor speed saving (~5%)
		-	But code maintenance was a nightmare.


1.08	Thur Nov 8 2001
		- rewrote lexer in verilog grammar for speed improvement.
		- now parsing ~1140 lines per second.

1.10	Wed Nov 21 2001
		- rewrote entire packages to be subroutine based
		- instead of method based for speed improvement.
		- now parsing ~1420 lines per second.
		- rewrite is pretty rough, just did it to see
		- how much faster it would be. may recode to clean it up.
