What can I use ApprovalTests for?

You can use ApprovalTests to verify objects that require more than
a simple assert including long strings, large arrays, and complex
hash structures and objects.  Although modules exist which allow this
kind of testing, ApprovalTests really shines when you need a more
granular look at the test failure.  Sometimes, trying to find a small
difference in a long string printed to STDOUT is just too hard!  
ApprovalTests solves this problem by providing reporters which let you
view the test results in one of many popular diff utilities.
