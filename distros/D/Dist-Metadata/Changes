Revision history for Dist-Metadata

0.927     2017-01-09T02:41:39Z

  - Change tests to not rely on '.' in @INC.
    Thanks to Graham Knop for the pull request (gh-15).

0.926     2015-04-29T03:16:55Z

  - Always add local, perl5, and fatlib to "no_index.directory"
    for consistency with PAUSE.  Closes gh-12 and gh-14.
    Thanks to Sawyer X for the pull-req and the prodding.

0.925     2013-02-08T02:40:09Z

  - Specify 1.03 as minimum required version of Digest
    to ensure that it tries Digest::SHA.  Closes gh-6.

0.924     2012-11-10T17:38:33Z

  - Add 'module_info' method for getting additional data (like checksums)
    with the provided module hashref.  Thanks to Jeffrey Ryan Thalhammer
    for the suggestion.
  - Add 'file_checksum' method to the Dist::Metadata::Dist base class.

0.923     2012-06-19T03:13:55Z

  - By default, when determining packages, filter out packages
    that don't match the file name (ones that can't be loaded via use/require).
    This mimics the behavior of PAUSE.
    If you want the old behavior of including "inner" packages in the meta
    "provides" set "include_inner_packages" to true in the constructor.
    Thanks to Jeffrey Ryan Thalhammer for finding and fixing this
    (and including tests)!

0.922     2011-10-19T22:30:53Z

  - Let CPAN::Meta set release_status instead of defaulting to 'stable'.
    Fixes an issue with dev/alpha versions.
    Thanks to Jeffrey Ryan Thalhammer (thaljef) for reporting and fixing.

0.920     2011-08-18T04:11:45Z

  [API Change]

  - Support zip archives (in addition to tar files).
    (Thanks to thaljef for reporting.)

  [Fixes]
  - Always include inc/, t/, and xt/ in meta/no_index.

    other subclasses.

  - Remove warning for no packages found (thaljef).

0.914     2011-08-02T16:01:46Z
