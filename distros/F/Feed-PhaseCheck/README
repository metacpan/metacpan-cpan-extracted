NAME

    Feed::PhaseCheck

    Finds the relative time delay between two feed segments.

    Accomplished by shifting one feed relative to the other and then
    computing the error (absolute difference).

    The shift that yields the lowest error corresponds to the relative
    delay between he two input feeds.

    The output consists of the delay found, and the error in delayed point.

SYNOPSIS

        use Feed::PhaseCheck qw(compare_feeds);
        my $sample = {
            "1451276654" => "1.097655",
            "1451276655" => "1.09765",
            #...
            "1451276763" => "1.0976",
            "1451276764" => "1.097595"
        };
        my $compare_to = {
            "1451276629" => "1.09765",
            "1451276630" => "1.09764916666667",
            #...
            "1451276791" => "1.097595",
            "1451276792" => "1.097595"
        };
        my $max_delay_check = 30;    # seconds
        my ($errors,$delay_with_min_err) = compare_feeds($sample,$compare_to,$max_delay_check);
