    - Use Dist::Zilla to build EU::MM

0.15 2008-02-25

    * Makefile.PL: Delete M::I in favor of EU::MM

0.14 2007-07-17

    * Makefile.PL: Globbing doesn't work on windows, do it explicitly in Perl

0.13 2007-07-16

    * lib*: Don't make dynamic dynamic libs, this should solve RT#28044

0.12 2007-07-13

    * lib*: Removed lib*/Makefile which accidentally snuck in
    * Makefile.PL: Nuked DOS line endings

0.11 2007-07-12

    * lib*: Removed the Plan 9 build system and replaced it with
            Makefile.PL's in each of the lib* directories. The
            software should now port to Windows (and anywhere perl
            builds). The removed files are lib*/Make.* and
            lib*/Makefile

    * t/split.t: More tests for the above, taken from re::engine::PCRE
    * Plan9.h: Brought up to date with blead
    * Makefile.PL: { use utf8 } on the non-ASCII author name
    * inc: Updated to Module::Install 0.67
    * lib*: patch lib[fmt|utf|regexp] to build on Linux-x86_64 (patch sent
            to Russ Cox)

0.07 2007-05-19

    * t/import.t: New test added while trying to write import/unimport
                  in XS which turned out to be too more trouble than it
                  was worth
    * t/unimport.t: ditto
