Sys-CpuAffinity v1.12
=====================

The Sys::CpuAffinity module seeks to "do one thing and do it well":
set CPU affinities for processes on any system that can use Perl
and by any means necessary.

The module is composed of several subroutines, each one 
implementing a different technique to perform a CPU affinity
operation. A technique might try to import a Perl module,
run an external program that might be installed on your system,
or invoke some C code to access your system libraries.
Usually, a technique is applicable to only a single
or small group of operating systems, and on any particular 
system, the vast majority of techniques would fail. 
Regardless of your particular system and configuration,
it is hoped that at least one of the techniques will work
and you will be able to get and set the CPU affinities of
your processes.


SUPPORTED SYSTEMS

The techniques for manipulating CPU affinities for Windows
(including Cygwin) and Linux have been refined and tested
pretty well. Some techniques applicable to BSD systems
(particularly FreeBSD) and Solaris have been tested a little 
bit. The hope is that this module will include more techniques 
for more systems in future releases. See the NOTE TO 
DEVELOPERS in the module's POD for information about 
how you can help.

MacOS and OpenBSD are explicitly not supported, as there does
not appear to be any public interface for specifying the CPU 
affinity of a process directly on these platforms.

NetBSD support is very limited. The getAffinity and setAffinity
calls will only work on the calling process, and will probably
only work for the super-user.


RECOMMENDED MODULES

The following modules are not required by Sys::CpuAffinity,
but Sys::CpuAffinity will try to use them if they are 
available.

        Win32::API, Win32::Process [MSWin32, cygwin]
        BSD::Process::Affinity     [FreeBSD]


INSTALLATION

To install this module, the Module::Build module must be
installed on your system. Then you may run the following commands:

	perl Build.PL
	./Build
	./Build test
	./Build install

If you need to rebuild the module, or install it for several
different version of Perl, it is recommended that you also
"./Build clean" before each new installation.


SUPPORT AND DOCUMENTATION

After installing, you can find documentation for this module with the
perldoc command.
