NAME
    WebService::Plotly - access plot.ly programmatically

VERSION
    version 1.133400

SYNOPSIS
        use WebService::Plotly;
    
        my $user = USERNAME_HERE;
        my $login = WebService::Plotly->signup( $user, EMAIL_HERE );
        warn "temp password is $login->{tmp_pw}";
    
        my $plotly = WebService::Plotly->new( un => $user, key => $login->{api_key} );

        my $x0 = [ 1,  2,  3,  4 ];
        my $y0 = [ 10, 15, 13, 17 ];
        my $x1 = [ 2,  3,  4,  5 ];
        my $y1 = [ 16, 5,  11, 9 ];
        my $response = $plotly->plot( $x0, $y0, $x1, $y1 );
    
        print "url is: $response->{url}";
        print "filename on our server is: $response->{filename}";

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides a smooth interface to the REST API of
    <http://plot.ly>. It will take both plain perl data as well as PDL
    objects and transform them as needed.

    Note that WS::Plotly caches the filename on the plotly server inside the
    object, so that further plot/style/layout calls can be used to modified
    an existing plot.

EXAMPLES
    You can find examples plots at <https://plot.ly/api/perl/>.

    A sample of the plots available are shown below (if you don't see images
    below, view this documentation on MetaCPAN
    <https://metacpan.org/pod/WebService::Plotly>). To view the example
    code, follow the links.

CONSTRUCTOR
    WS::Plotly uses a standard Moo constructor.

ATTRIBUTES
  un
    Expects a string containing the username to be sent to the API for
    authentification.

    Required attribute.

  key
    Expects a string containing the API key to be sent to the API for
    authentification.

    Required attribute.

  fileopt
    Expects a string containing options sent to the API with every data
    call, concerning usage of the filename parameter. See the bottom of
    <https://plot.ly/api/>.

  filename
    Expects a string containing options sent to the API with every data
    call, determining the name for the plot resulting of the call, or a name
    of the plot to be reused for this call.

  verbose
    Boolean that determines whether the server message (containing the plot
    url and filename) will be printed to the console. Defaults to 1.

METHODS
  version
    Returns the version of the API object, which will be sent to the API.

  my $response = $plotly->signup( $username, $email )
    Creates a new account on the server, if possible. Returns a hash
    containing the temporary password of the new account, as well as the api
    key.

   DATA CALLS
    All of these calls take arguments in this fashion:

        $plotly->plot( @data, %options );

    Beginning from the start of the argument list all elements will be
    slurped into a data array (they're generally expected to be array
    references or PDL objects) until the first scalar with a ref() value is
    reached.

    This is assumed to be a hash key and it along with all following scalars
    will be slurped into an option hash.

    This means that the data calls generally do not care if they are sent an
    array reference containing a list of data array referencess as the first
    argument, or a flat list of data array references.

    All of the data calls return a response hash containing the keys url,
    message, warning, filename and error. Normally only url and filename
    will be interesting to you; however message can contain extra
    information and will be printed if verbose is set to 1, warning can
    contain warnings from the server and is always printed with warn(),
    while a value in the error key triggers the module to die.

    These data calls exist and reading the documentation at the bottom of
    <https://plot.ly/api/> is recommended.

  plot
    This sends data to Plotly to be plotted and stored.

  style
    This call is used to style the data sets sent to the server with the
    plot call.

  layout
    This call customizes the style of the layout, the axes, and the legend.

    general for providing much support and help in creating this module, as
    well as footing the bill for it.
