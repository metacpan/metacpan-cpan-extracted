NAME

    Test::Script - Basic cross-platform tests for scripts

VERSION

    version 1.26

SYNOPSIS

     use Test2::V0;
     use Test::Script;
     
     script_compiles('script/myscript.pl');
     script_runs(['script/myscript.pl', '--my-argument']);
     
     program_runs(['ls', '/dev']);
     
     done_testing;

DESCRIPTION

    The intent of this module is to provide a series of basic tests for 80%
    of the testing you will need to do for scripts in the script (or bin as
    is also commonly used) paths of your Perl distribution.

    It also provides similar functions for testing programs that are not
    Perl scripts.

    Further, it aims to provide this functionality with perfect
    platform-compatibility, and in a way that is as unobtrusive as
    possible.

    That is, if the program works on a platform, then Test::Script should
    always work on that platform as well. Anything less than 100% is
    considered unacceptable.

    In doing so, it is hoped that Test::Script can become a module that you
    can safely make a dependency of all your modules, without risking that
    your module won't on some platform because of the dependency.

    Where a clash exists between wanting more functionality and maintaining
    platform safety, this module will err on the side of platform safety.

FUNCTIONS

 script_compiles

     script_compiles( $script, $test_name );

    The "script_compiles" test calls the script with "perl -c script.pl",
    and checks that it returns without error.

    The path it should be passed is a relative Unix-format script name.
    This will be localised when running perl -c and if the test fails the
    local name used will be shown in the diagnostic output.

    Note also that the test will be run with the same perl interpreter that
    is running the test script (and not with the default system perl). This
    will also be shown in the diagnostic output on failure.

 script_runs

     script_runs( $script, $test_name );
     script_runs( \@script_and_arguments, $test_name );
     script_runs( $script, \%options, $test_name );
     script_runs( \@script_and_arguments, \%options, $test_name );

    The "script_runs" test executes the script with "perl script.pl" and
    checks that it returns success.

    The path it should be passed is a relative unix-format script name.
    This will be localised when running perl -c and if the test fails the
    local name used will be shown in the diagnostic output.

    The test will be run with the same perl interpreter that is running the
    test script (and not with the default system perl). This will also be
    shown in the diagnostic output on failure.

    You may pass in options as a hash as the second argument.

    exit

      The expected exit value. The default is to use whatever indicates
      success on your platform (usually 0).

    interpreter_options

      Array reference of Perl options to be passed to the interpreter.
      Things like -w or -x can be passed this way. This may be either a
      single string or an array reference.

    signal

      The expected signal. The default is 0. Use with care! This may not be
      portable, and is known not to work on Windows.

    stdin

      The input to be passed into the script via stdin. The value may be
      one of

      simple scalar

	Is considered to be a filename.

      scalar reference

	In which case the input will be drawn from the data contained in
	the referenced scalar.

      The behavior for any other types is undefined (the current
      implementation uses Capture::Tiny). Any already opened stdin will be
      closed.

    stdout

      Where to send the standard output to. If you use this option, then
      the the behavior of the script_stdout_ functions below are undefined.
      The value may be one of

      simple scalar

	Is considered to be a filename.

      scalar reference

      In which case the standard output will be places into the referenced
      scalar

      The behavior for any other types is undefined (the current
      implementation uses Capture::Tiny).

    stderr

      Same as stdout above, except for stderr.

 script_stdout_is

     script_stdout_is $expected_stdout, $test_name;

    Tests if the output to stdout from the previous "script_runs" matches
    the expected value exactly.

 script_stdout_isnt

     script_stdout_is $expected_stdout, $test_name;

    Tests if the output to stdout from the previous "script_runs" does NOT
    match the expected value exactly.

 script_stdout_like

     script_stdout_like $regex, $test_name;

    Tests if the output to stdout from the previous "script_runs" matches
    the regular expression.

 script_stdout_unlike

     script_stdout_unlike $regex, $test_name;

    Tests if the output to stdout from the previous "script_runs" does NOT
    match the regular expression.

 script_stderr_is

     script_stderr_is $expected_stderr, $test_name;

    Tests if the output to stderr from the previous "script_runs" matches
    the expected value exactly.

 script_stderr_isnt

     script_stderr_is $expected_stderr, $test_name;

    Tests if the output to stderr from the previous "script_runs" does NOT
    match the expected value exactly.

 script_stderr_like

     script_stderr_like $regex, $test_name;

    Tests if the output to stderr from the previous "script_runs" matches
    the regular expression.

 script_stderr_unlike

     script_stderr_unlike $regex, $test_name;

    Tests if the output to stderr from the previous "script_runs" does NOT
    match the regular expression.

 program_runs

     program_runs( $program, $test_name );
     program_runs( \@program_and_arguments, $test_name );
     program_runs( $program, \%options, $test_name );
     program_runs( \@program_and_arguments, \%options, $test_name );

    The "program_runs" test executes the given program and checks that it
    returns success. This function works like "script_runs" except:

      * The path $program or @program_and_arguments is passed as-is to
      system() <https://perldoc.perl.org/functions/system.html>. This means
      program_runs can test any program, not just Perl scripts.

      * The %options do not support the interpreter_options key.

    See File::Spec or Path::Class for routines useful in building pathnames
    in a cross-platform way.

 program_stdout_is

     program_stdout_is $expected_stdout, $test_name;

    Tests if the output to stdout from the previous "program_runs" matches
    the expected value exactly.

 program_stdout_isnt

     program_stdout_is $expected_stdout, $test_name;

    Tests if the output to stdout from the previous "program_runs" does NOT
    match the expected value exactly.

 program_stdout_like

     program_stdout_like $regex, $test_name;

    Tests if the output to stdout from the previous "program_runs" matches
    the regular expression.

 program_stdout_unlike

     program_stdout_unlike $regex, $test_name;

    Tests if the output to stdout from the previous "program_runs" does NOT
    match the regular expression.

 program_stderr_is

     program_stderr_is $expected_stderr, $test_name;

    Tests if the output to stderr from the previous "program_runs" matches
    the expected value exactly.

 program_stderr_isnt

     program_stderr_is $expected_stderr, $test_name;

    Tests if the output to stderr from the previous "program_runs" does NOT
    match the expected value exactly.

 program_stderr_like

     program_stderr_like $regex, $test_name;

    Tests if the output to stderr from the previous "program_runs" matches
    the regular expression.

 program_stderr_unlike

     program_stderr_unlike $regex, $test_name;

    Tests if the output to stderr from the previous "program_runs" does NOT
    match the regular expression.

CAVEATS

    This module is fully supported back to Perl 5.8.1.

    The STDIN handle will be closed when using script_runs with the stdin
    option. An older version used IPC::Run3, which attempted to save STDIN,
    but apparently this cannot be done consistently or portably. We now use
    Capture::Tiny instead and explicitly do not support saving STDIN
    handles.
