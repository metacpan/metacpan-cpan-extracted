Older changes:

2003-03-17 v0.01 Tels - 2 tests - first version
2003-03-18 v0.02 Tels - 7 tests
2003-03-21 v0.03 Tels - 6 tests - first release
  * adapted to SDL_perl 1.20.2 (see http://bloodgate.com/perl/sdl)
  * added pre_output() and post_output() for more speed
  * made my own font map (courier.bmp), which made much more parameters to
    new() neccessary: chars, chars_per_line, char_width, char_height etc.
2003-03-23 v0.04 Tels - 8 tests
  * removed double my's that caused warnings
  * font.t refered to the wrong texture file, so it failed
  * removed the set parameter, it does not make sense when you have more then
    128 chars (no idea how you could access the other characters in the
    example font from NeHe, I think having only one font per texture is much 
    cleaner)
  * added align_x(), align_y() and align(). Also constants FONT_ALIGN_foo, 
    where foo is LEFT, RIGHT, TOP, BOTTOM or CENTER.
  * added char_width(), char_height()
  * fixed: color() takes array ref or 3 values
2003-04-08 v0.05 Tels - 8 tests
  * post_output() and pre_output() warn when called in wrong order
  * post_output() restores flags to pre pre_output() way
  * document that post_output() disables writes to depth buffer
  * DESTROY method released OpenGL lists by using glDeleteLists()
2003-04-27 v0.06 Tels - 10 tests
  * fixed the DESTROY method
  * copy(): GLGenLists($self->{chars}), not just 256
  * added border_x(), border_y() and support for these in new()

Please send me test-reports, your experiences with this and your ideas - I love
to hear about my work!
