=head1 NAME

XML::Compile::WSS::Sign - Base for WSS Signers

=head1 INHERITANCE

 XML::Compile::WSS::Sign is extended by
   XML::Compile::WSS::Sign::HMAC
   XML::Compile::WSS::Sign::RSA

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  # either
  use XML::Compile::WSS::Util qw/DSIG_RSA_SHA1/;
  my $sign = XML::Compile::WSS::Sign->new
    ( sign_method => DSIG_RSA_SHA1
    , private_key => $key
    , ...
    );

  # or
  use XML::Compile::WSS::Sign::RSA;
  my $sign = XML::Compile::WSS::Sign::RSA->new
    ( hashing     => 'SHA1'
    , private_key => $key
    , ...
    );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Hire me to implement other signers!

=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=item XML::Compile::WSS::Sign-E<gt>B<fromConfig>(HASH|PAIRS)

Try to be very flexible.  CONFIG can be a HASH, which could also be
passed to L<new()|XML::Compile::WSS::Sign/"Constructors"> directly.  But it can also be various kinds of
objects.

=item XML::Compile::WSS::Sign-E<gt>B<new>(%options)

 -Option     --Default
  sign_method  DSIG_RSA_SHA1

=head1 DETAILS

=head2 Signing, the generic part

The base of this whole security protocol is crypto-signing the messages,
so you will always need to specify some parameters for L<new()|XML::Compile::WSS::Sign/"Constructors">.

  my $wss  = XML::Compile::WSS::Signature->new
    ( signer => DSIG_$algo
    , ...parameters for $algo...
    );

When the algorithm is known (see the next sections of this chapter),
then the parameters will be used to produce the CODE which will do the
signing.

=head2 Defend against man-in-the-middle

The signature can easily be spoofed with a man-in-the-middle attack,
unless you hard-code the remote's public key.

  my $wss  = XML::Compile::WSS::Signature->new
    ( ...
    , remote_token          => $token
    );
