Net-eBay

This module allows users to communicate with eBay using perl and their
XML based eBay API. You can use it to list items for sale, bid, get
seller item list, search, get ebay time, or do anything else.

Many details of this API can be found at http://developer.ebay.com. To
be able to use this module, you need to register there and obtain keys
and a authentication token using "tokentool".

The job of its module is to encapsulate connectivity and
authentication, and communication with ebay. First, you need to
initialize your ebay connection by passing it credentials. After that,
you can send queries to eBay. A typical request is comprised of its
name, and a hash table of application parameters.

It supports BOTH New and Legacy API (Legacy API will expire in summer
2006).

Example of listing an item for sale:
  
  use Net::eBay;
  use Data::Dumper;
  
  my $ebay = new Net::eBay( {
                                site_level => 'prod',
                                DeveloperKey => '...',
                                ApplicationKey => '...',
                                CertificateKey => '...',
                                Token => '...',
                               } ); 
  
  my $result = $ebay->submitRequest( "AddItem",
                        {
                         DetailLevel => "0",
                         ErrorLevel => "1",
                         SiteId => "0",
                         Verb => "  AddItem",
                         Category => "14111",
                         CheckoutDetailsSpecified => "0",
                         Country => "us",
                         Currency => "1",
                         Description => "For sale is like new <A HREF=http://www.example.com/jhds/>thingamabob</A>.Shipping is responsibility of the buyer.",
                         Duration => "7",
                         Location => "Anytown, USA, 43215",
                         Gallery => 1,
                         GalleryURL => 'http://igor.chudov.com/images/mark_mattson.jpg',
                         MinimumBid => "0.99",
                         BuyItNowPrice => 19.99,
                         PayPalAccepted => "1",
                         PayPalEmailAddress => "ichudov\@example.com",
                         Quantity => "1",
                         Region => "60",
                         Title => "Igor's Item with Gallery xaxa",
                        }
                      );
  
    print "Result: " . Dumper( $result ) . "\n";
  
Result of submitRequest is a perl hash obtained from the response XML using XML::Simple, something like this:
  
  Result: $VAR1 = {
            'Item' => {
                      'Id' => '4503546598',
                      'Fees' => {
