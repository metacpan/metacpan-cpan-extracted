Below is a list of things which probably need attention, along with comments on
whether I think *I'm* going to do anything about them, and other comments / considerations.

If you're looking for something to do, you just found it.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes to complete for this version ...

- Why is lock() calling apply() ???

- Fix inserting for multi-column primary keys

- Support serials and 'other' methods of primary key setting

- Document toolchain setup

- Move 'decimals' to 'decimal_places'

- Copy a combo's model into the find dialog when searching on a field that is represented by a combo
    
    Now that we've added a right-click 'find' item to Combo's entries, maybe we should
    do some magic to get the combo's model in the find dialog. This will allow people to search
    on values they're used to ( from a combo box ), instead of having to use IDs.
    
    This will require somewhat of a rework of the find dialog. What do we do if people change
    the criteria field? Delete the combo? What if they change the criteria field on a non-current
    row? There's currently no way of getting to the combo. We'd have to store a hidden value
    in each row so we can get to the right combo to delete it. See below.
    
- Find dialog: better criteria editing
    
    We need to store a row id in each criteria row so we can do things like delete the row,
    delete a widget in the row, etc

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes for a later version ...

 - class variable for date format

 - multi-table queries fail to select because they can't get hold of a primary key
   - convert to pass-through?

 - add 'sql_in_errors' key to control whether we put SQL strings in error dialogs when an
 	error occurs

- Port Gtk2::Ex::Datasheet::DBI's more advanced insert() method
    ( array of field / value things for inserting a record AND setting values )

- Record Spinner's max value gets set, but the widget doesn't reflect this ( display or behaviour )
    until the user has clicked a value with their left button ( ie right button doesn't work )

- Create a custom date combo widget

- Create a custom time spinner widget

- Automatically apply formatting for numeric & currency fields

- Document TimeSpinner support?
    - This is a pretty dodgy solution, as dodgy solutions go.

- Replace TimeSpinner with an actual Gtk2::Perl object?

- Attach set_active_iter_for_broken_combo_box() to all combos?

- Fix creation of self so applications don't have to call paint()
    to get on_current code to trigger the 1st time

- Create a widget for TIME fields - probably just a collection of 3 spinbuttons, packed into an hbox.
    We'd attach to an existing hbox in the glade xml file.
    
- Create a *compact* widget for DATE fields. Gtk2::Calendar is good, but it's too big.
    We could have a combo box with a drop-down Gtk2::Calender.
    Alternatively, we could have a similar approach to the TIME widget ( above )
    
- Adding support for more DB servers: don't have access to other DB servers / not interested
    
    - Oracle
	Completely untested
    
    - SQL Server
	FreeTDS ==> UnixODBC ==> DBD::ODBC chain *kinda* works. It usually works anyway.
	Retest periodically.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Blue-Sky stuff

- Add 'dump_to_xml' function
- Create a gtk2-perl GUI to create & edit the output of the above :)
    - What do we do about things like coderefs?
    - What do we do about DBI handles? Save connection strings in ~/.axis ?
