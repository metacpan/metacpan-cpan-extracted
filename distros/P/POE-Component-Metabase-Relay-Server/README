    component

VERSION

    version 0.38

SYNOPSIS

      use strict;
      use warnings;
    
      use POE qw[Component::Metabase::Relay::Server];
    
      my $test_httpd = POE::Component::Metabase::Relay::Server->spawn(
        port    => 8080,
        id_file => shift,
        dsn     => 'dbi:SQLite:dbname=dbfile',
        uri     => 'https://metabase.example.foo/',
        debug   => 1,
      );
    
      $poe_kernel->run();
      exit 0;

DESCRIPTION

    POE::Component::Metabase::Relay::Server is a relay server for Metabase.
    It provides a listener that accepts connections from
    Test::Reporter::Transport::Socket based CPAN Testers and relays the
    Storable serialised data to Metabase using
    POE::Component::Metabase::Client::Submit.

    POE::Component::Client::HTTP is used to submit reports usually, but if
    version 0.06 of POE::Component::Curl::Multi is found to be installed,
    this will be used in preference. You can disable this usage using the
    no_curl option to spawn.

NAME

    POE::Component::Metabase::Relay::Server - A Metabase relay server
    component

VERSION

    version 0.34

CONSTRUCTOR

    spawn

      Spawns a new component session and creates a SQLite database if it
      doesn't already exist.

      Takes a number of mandatory parameters:

        'id_file', the file path of a Metabase ID file;
        'dsn', a DBI DSN to use to store the submission queue;
        'uri', the uri of metabase server to submit to;

      and a number of optional parameters:

        'address', the address to bind the listener to, defaults to INADDR_ANY;
        'port', the port to listen on, defaults to 0, which picks a random port;
        'username', a DSN username if required;
        'password', a DSN password if required;
        'db_opts', a hashref of DBD options that is passed to POE::Component::EasyDBI;
        'debug', enable debugging information;
        'multiple', set to true to enable the Queue to use multiple PoCo-Client-HTTPs, default 0;
        'no_relay', set to true to disable report submissions to the Metabase, default 0;
        'no_curl',  set to true to disable automatic usage of POE::Component::Curl::Multi, default 0;
        'submissions', an int to control the number of parallel http clients ( used only if multiple == 1 ), default 10;
        'session', a POE::Session alias or session ID to send events to;
        'recv_event', an event to be triggered when reports are received by the relay;

      address may be either an simple scalar value or an arrayref of
      addresses to bind to.

      If recv_event is specified an event will be sent for every report
      received by the relay server. Unless session is specified this event
      will be sent to the parent session of the component.

OUTPUT EVENTS

    If recv_event is specified to spawn, an event will be sent with the
    following:

    ARG0 will be a HASHREF with the following keys:

     osversion
     distfile
     archname
     textreport
     osname
     perl_version
     grade

    ARG1 will be the IP address of the client that sent the report.

    If queue_event is specified to spawn, an event will be sent for
    particular changes in queue status
