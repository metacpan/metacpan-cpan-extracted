Device-Inverter-Aurora version 0.02
====================================

Based on Curt Blank's Aurora program (http://www.curtronics.com/Solar/AuroraData.html)
which is in turn based on Power One's 'Aurora Inverter Series - Communication Protocol -'
document, Rel. 4.6 25/02/09.

Having not so far been able to obtain a copy of this document from Power One I've had to
make some educated guesses as to some things, but for the most part this library should
be functional to the point the original Aurora program is.
