Win32::GUI::Tooltip - Create and manipulate Tooltip controls

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Tooltip controls are probably one of the most unintuitave of the Win32
controls when you first come accross them.  A Tooltip control is a
single window that supports one or more 'tools'.  A tool is a window,
or an area of a window that when the mouse hovers over, the tooltip
window is displayed.  The Tooltip is always a top level window (so
don't try adding the WS_CHILD window style), and is typically owned
by the top level window of your application/dialog.

Create a tooltip window:

  my $tt = Win32::GUI::Tooltip->new(
    $main_window,
  );

Add a tool to the tooltip:

  $tt->AddTool(
    -window => $main_window,
    -text   => "Text that pops up",
  );

and hover the mouse over an area of your main window.

=head2 new

B<new(PARENT, %OPTIONS)>

Creates a new Tooltip object.
Can also be called as PARENT->AddTooltip(%OPTIONS).

Class specific B<%OPTIONS> are:

  -alwaystip => 0/1 (default: 1)
     Show the tooltip, even if the window is not active.
  -noprefix  => 0/1 (default: 0)
     Prevent the tooltip control stripping '&' prefixes
  -noanimate => 0/1 (default: 0)
     Turn off tooltip window animation
  -nofade    => 0/1 (default: 0)
     Turn off tooltip window fading effect
  -balloon   => 0/1 (default: 0)
     Give the tooltip window 'balloon' style

See also the L<common options|Win32::GUI::Reference::Options>.

=head2 Activate

B<Activate([FLAG=TRUE])>

Activates or deactivates a tooltip control. A deactivated tooltip does
not show it's window when the mouse hovers over a tool.

=head2 AddTool

B<AddTool(@OPTIONS)>

Registers a tool with a Tooltip. When the house hovers over a tool, the
tooltip window is displayed.  A tool is identified either by a window
(handle) alone, or by a window (handle) and an application defined id.
If identified by a window (handle) alone, then the associated area for
the mouse to hover is the whole client area of the window, and adjusts
automatically if the window changes size.  Otherwise the rect
is fixed, as provided by the C<-rect> options (in client co-ordinates of
the window it is associated with) and must be adjusted manually if
necessary - See L<NewToolRect()|Win32::GUI::Tooltip/NewToolRect>.

B<@OPTIONS>:

 -window => HANDLE (default: owner window of tooltip control)
    Window object or window handle for the tool.
 -id => ID
    application set ID for the tool.

 -rect => [LEFT,TOP,RIGHT,BOTTOM] (defult: client rect of -window)
    Area of the tool (ignored unless ID is provided)
 -text   => STRING or ID
   String containd the Tool text, or a resource ID (see -hinst)
 -hinst  => HINSTANCE
   If -text contains a resource ID, then -hinst gives the instance
   handle from which the string resource is loaded.  Ignored otherwise.
 -needtext => 0/1 (default: 0)
    Use NeedText Event. Don't mix this and -text.

 -flags  => FLAGS
    Set of TTF_ bit flags.  Better set using these options:
      -absolute => 0/1 (default: 0)
         Use with -track.  Position the window at the co_ordinates
         set using the TrackPosition() method.
      -centertip => 0/1 (default: 0)
         Center the window below the tool.
      -idishwnd => 0/1 (default: 0 if -id used, 1 otherwise)
         indicates that the tool applies to the whole window.
      -rtlreading => 0/1 (default: 0)
         indicates that text will be rendered in the opposite direction
         to text in the parent window
      -subclass => 0/1 (default: 0 if -track is used, 1 otherwise)
         the tooltip control will arrange to get mouse messages from the
         winodw containing the tool automatically.  If this option is not
         set then the application must relay mouse messages itself.
      -track => 0/1 (default: 0)
         Positions the ToolTip window next to the tool to which it
         corresponds and moves the window according to coordinates
         supplied by the TrackPosition() method. You must activate
         this type of tool using the TrackActivate() method.
      -transparent => 0/1 (default: 0)
         Causes the ToolTip control to forward mouse event messages to the
         parent window. This is limited to mouse events that occur within
         the bounds of the ToolTip window.

Returns true on success, false on failure.

=head2 AdjustRect

B<AdjustRect(LEFT, TOP, RIGHT, BOTTOM, [LARGER=1])>

Adjust either a wanted text rect to a window rect (if C<LARGER = 1>) or
a window rect to a text rect (if C<LARGER = 0>).

C<LEFT>, C<TOP>, C<RIGHT>, C<BOTTOM> identify the corners to the rect to
convert.

C<LARGER> identifies whether the provided rect is a text rect (to be made
larger) if true, or a window rect otherwise.

Returns a 4-element list containing the adjusted left, top, right and
bottom co-ordinates of the window on success, or an empty list on failure.

B<BUFSIZE> sets the size of the buffer for retrieving the text associated
with the tool.  By default this is zero, and the text is not retrieved.
As there is no way to automatically determine the size of the buffer
required, this is a potential security hole, as the text may overrun
the size of the buffer provided.  B<Only use this if you really need to
find out the text, and are prepared to live with the consequences>.

Example:

   my $tt = Win32::GUI::Tooltip->new( ... );
   ....
   require Data::Dump;
   my $i=0;
   while(my %h = $tt->EnumTools($i)) {
     print "TOOL:$i\n";
     print Data::Dump::dump(\%h), "\n";
     ++$i;
   }
   my $j = $tt->GetToolCount()-1;

Or:

B<SetMaxTipWidth(WIDTH)>

Sets the maximum width for a tooltip window.

The maximum ToolTip width value does not indicate a ToolTip window's
actual width. Rather, if a ToolTip string exceeds the maximum width, the
control breaks the text into multiple lines, using spaces to determine
line breaks. If the text cannot be segmented into multiple lines, it will
be displayed on a single line. The length of this line may exceed the
maximum ToolTip width.

Returns the previous maximum width (-1 if no previous maximum width
has been set)

=head2 SetToolInfo

B<SetToolInfo(@OPTIONS)>

Sets the information that a tooltip control maintains for a tool.

B<@OPTIONS>: See L<Add()|Win32::GUI::Tooltip/Add>.

Some internal properties of a tool are established when the tool is
created, and are not recomputed when the SetToolInfo() method is used.
If you simply using SetToolInfo(), setting the required values
these properties may be lost. Instead, your application should first
request the tool's current properties using the GetToolInfo() method,
then, modify the options as needed and pass them back to the ToolTip
control with SetToolInfo().

=head2 TrackActivate

B<TrackActivate(TOOL, [FLAG=1])>

Activates or deactivates a tracking tooltip.
See L<AddTool()|Win32::GUI::Tooltip/AddTool>, C<-track> option.

C<TOOL> identifies the tool to use to calculate the window size.
C<TOOL> may be one of the following:

  ID           - only for backwards compatibility with Win32::GUI v1.03
                 and earlier. A tool id identifying a tool that occupies
                 part of a window. The associated window defaults to the
                 owner window of the tooltip control, as for the default
                 for the -window option of the AddTool() method.
                 See L<AddTool()|Win32::GUI::Tooltip/AddTool>.
  WINDOW       - a window object or window handle, identifying a tool
                 that occupies the whole window.
  [WINDOW]     - an array reference containing a window object or window
                 handle, identifying a tool that occupies the whole
                 window.
  [WINDOW, ID] - an array reference containing a window object or window
                 handle and a tool id, identifying a tool that occupies
                 part of a window.

C<WINDOW> and/or C<ID> are the values used for the C<-window> and/or <-id>
options used with the AddTool() method.  See L<AddTool()|Win32::GUI::Tooltip/AddTool>.

C<FLAG> identifies whether tracking is activated (1) or deactivated (0)
