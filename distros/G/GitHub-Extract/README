NAME
    GitHub::Extract - Extract an exported copy of a GitHub project

SYNOPSIS
            my $project = GitHub::Extract->new(
                    username => 'adamkennedy',
                    project  => 'PPI',
            );
            
        $project->extract( to => '/my/directory' );

DESCRIPTION
    GitHub::Extract is a simple light weight interface to
    <http://github.com/> for the sole purpose of retrieving and extracting a
    "zipball" of a public (and likely open source) project.

    It makes use of the plain route used by the user interface "zip" button,
    and as a result it avoids the need to use the full GitHub API and
    client.

    This module shares extends (and emulates where needed) the API of
    Archive::Extract. Any existing tooling code which uses Archive::Extract
    to work with release tarballs should be trivially upgradable to work
    with projects directly from GitHub instead.

METHODS
  new
            my $branch = GitHub::Extract->new(
                    username   => 'adamkennedy',
                    repository => 'PPI',

                    # Fetch a branch other than master
                    branch     => 'mybranch',

                    # A custom HTTP client can be provided to any constructor
                    http       => HTTP::Tiny->new(
                            # Custom HTTP setup goes here
                    ),
            );

    The "new" constructor identifies a project to download (but does not
    take any immediate action to do the download).

    It takes a number of simple parameters to control where to download
    from.

    username
        The GitHub username identifying the owner of the repository.

    repository
        The name of the repository within the account or organisation.

    branch
        An optional parameter identifying a particular branch to download.
        If not specificied, the 'master' branch will be fetched.

    http
        GitHub::Extract will create a HTTP::Tiny object with default
        settings to download the zipball from GitHub.

        This parameter allows you to use your own custom HTTP::Tiny client
        with alternative settings.

    Returns a new GitHub::Extract object, or false on error.

  username
    The "username" method returns the GitHub username for the request.

  repository
    The "repository" method returns the GitHub repository name for the
    request.

  branch
    The "branch" method returns the name of the branch to be fetched.

  url
    The "url" method returns the full download URL used to fetch the
    zipball.

  http
    The "http" method returns the HTTP client that will be used for the
    request.

  archive
    The "archive" method will return the absolute path to the downloaded zip
    file on disk, if the download was successful.

    Returns "undef" if the download was not completed successfully.

  archive_extract
    The "archive_extract" method will return the Archive::Extract object
    used to extract the files from the zipball, whether or not it extracted
    successfully.

    Returns "undef" if the download was not completed successfully.

  extract
            $project->extract( to => '/output/path' );

    Extracts the archive represented by the GitHub::Extract object to the
    path of your choice as specified by the "to" argument. Defaults to
    "cwd()".

    In the case that you did not specify a "to" argument, the output file
    will be the name of the archive file, stripped from its ".gz" suffix, in
    the current working directory.

    It will return true on success, and false on failure.

  pushd
            my $guard = $project->pushd( to => '/output/path' );

    The "pushd" method downloads and extracts the project from GitHub, and
    then temporarily changes the current working directory into the extract
    path of the project.

    Returns a File::pushd guard object which will return the current working
    directory to the original location when it is deleted, or false if the
    archive was not extracted.

  extract_path
            # Prints '/output/path/myproject-0.01-af41bc'
            if ( $project->extract( to => '/output/path' ) ) {
                    print $project->extract_path;
            }

    The "extract_path" method returns the absolute path of the logical root
    directory of the zipball, once it has been extracted.

    Since some archives will contain a single root directory within the zip
    file with which the content is placed (and some will not) this
    compensates for the different, detecting the logical root automatically.

    See "extract" in Archive::Extract for more details.

  files
    The "files" method returns an array ref with the paths of all the files
    in the archive, relative to the "to" argument you specified.

    To get the full path to an extracted file, you would use:

        File::Spec->catfile( $to, $ae->files->[0] );

    See "extract" in Archive::Extract for more details.

  error
            my $simple  = $project->error;
            my $verbose = $project->error(1);

    The "error" method returns the last encountered error as string.

    Pass it a true value to get the detailed output instead, as produced by
    "longmess" in Carp.

GLOBAL VARIABLES
    All global variables share the names and behaviour of the equivalent
    variables in Archive::Extract. Their value will be propogated down to
    the equivalent variables in Archive::Extract whenever it is being used.

  $GitHub::Extract::DEBUG
    Set this variable to "true" to have all calls to command line tools be
    printed out, including all their output.

    This also enables "Carp::longmess" errors, instead of the regular "carp"
    errors.

    Good for tracking down why things don't work with your particular setup.

    Defaults to "false".

  $GitHub::Extract::WARN
    This variable controls whether errors encountered internally by
    "GitHub::Extract" should be "carp"'d or not.

    Set to false to silence warnings. Inspect the output of the "error()"
    method manually to see what went wrong.

    Defaults to "true".
