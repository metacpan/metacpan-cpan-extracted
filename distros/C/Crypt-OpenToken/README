NAME

    Crypt::OpenToken - Perl implementation of Ping Identity's "OpenToken"

SYNOPSIS

      use Crypt::OpenToken;
    
      my $data = {
          foo => 'bar',
          bar => 'baz',
      };
    
      # create an OpenToken factory based on a given shared password
      my $factory = Crypt::OpenToken->new(password => 'abc123');
    
      # encrypt a hash-ref of data into an OpenToken.
      my $token_str = $factory->create(
          Crypt::OpenToken::CIPHER_AES128,
          $data,
      );
    
      # decrypt an OpenToken, check if its valid, and get data back out
      my $token = $factory->parse($token_str);
      if ($token->is_valid) {
          $data = $token->data();
      }

DESCRIPTION

    This module provides a Perl implementation of the "OpenToken" standard
    as defined by Ping Identity in their IETF Draft.

METHODS

    Crypt::OpenToken->new(password => $password)

      Instantiates a new OpenToken factory, which can encrypt/decrypt
      OpenTokens using the specified shared $password.

    $factory->create($cipher, $data)

      Encrypts the given hash-ref of $data using the specified $cipher
      (which should be one of the CIPHER_* constants).

      Returns back to the caller a Base64 encoded string which represents
      the OpenToken.

      NOTE: during the encryption of the OpenToken, a random Initialization
      Vector will be selected; as such it is not possible to encrypt the
      same data more than once and get the same OpenToken back.

    $factory->parse($token)

      Decrypts a Base64 encoded OpenToken, returning a
      Crypt::OpenToken::Token object back to the caller. Throws a fatal
      exception in the event of an error.

      It is the callers responsibility to then check to see if the token
      itself is valid (see Crypt::OpenToken::Token for details).

CONSTANTS

    The following constant values are available for selecting an encryption
    cipher to use:

    Crypt::OpenToken::CIPHER_NULL

      "Null" encryption (e.g. no encryption whatsoever). Requires
      Crypt::NULL.

    Crypt::OpenToken::CIPHER_AES256

      "AES" encryption, 256-bit. Requires Crypt::Rijndael.

    Crypt::OpenToken::CIPHER_AES128

      "AES" encryption, 128-bit. Requires Crypt::Rijndael.

    Crypt::OpenToken::CIPHER_DES3

      "TripleDES" encryption, 168-bit. Requires Crypt::DES.

CAVEATS

      * This module does not (yet) support the "obfuscate password" option
      that is configurable within PingFederate's OpenToken adapter.
