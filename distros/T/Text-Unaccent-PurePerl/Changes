0.04  Thu Apr 24 14:50:33     2008

    * Changed syntax for faster loop.

    * Switched to UTF-8 in module file, since both CPAN and 'pod2html' use the
      UTF-8 encoding for HTML files.

    * Giving up support for Perl < 5.8, since UTF-8 support is rotten.

    * Better user feedback during signature testing.

0.03  Wed Apr 23 16:01:27     2008

    * Modified nice_string() function in test scripts to become compatible with
      Perl < 5.8 (although Perl >= 5.6 is required).

    * Included code testing the utf8 flag of strings. This code is only run under
      Perl >= 5.8.

    * Included signature testing. This requires that the TEST_SIGNATURE environment
      variable is set.

0.02  Mon Apr 21 08:27:40 WEDT 2008

    * Removed stuff accidentally left over from development. This stuff required
      the Text::Unaccent module.

0.01  Fri Apr  4 09:40:49 2008

    * First version, released on an unsuspecting world.
