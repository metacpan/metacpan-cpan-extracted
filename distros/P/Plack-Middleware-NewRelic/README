        my $app = sub { ... } # as usual
        # NewRelic Options

DESCRIPTION

    With the above in place, Plack::Middleware::NewRelic will instrument
    your Plack application and send information to NewRelic, using the
    NewRelic::Agent module.

    Parameters

    - license_key

      A valid NewRelic license key for your account.

      This value is also automatically sourced from the
      NEWRELIC_LICENSE_KEY environment variable.

    - app_name

      The name of your application.

      This value is also automatically sourced from the NEWRELIC_APP_NAME
      environment variable.

    - path_rules

      A HashRef containing path replacement rules, containing
      case-insensitive regex patterns as string keys, and evaluatable
      strings as replacement values.

      Regex capturing groups work as intended, so you can specify something
      like this in your ruleset:

          # Replaces '/pages/new/asdf' with '/pages/new'
          '(\/pages\/new)\/\S+' => '$1'
