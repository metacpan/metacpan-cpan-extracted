SYNOPSIS

    This module has been DEPRECATED in favor of WebService::Client. Please
    consider using that instead.

        {
            package WebService::Foo;
            use Moo;
            with 'WebService::BaseClientRole';
    
            has auth_token => ( is => 'ro', required => 1 );
            has '+base_url' => ( default => 'https://foo.com/v1' );
    
            sub BUILD {
                my ($self) = @_;
                $self->ua->default_header('X-Auth-Token' => $self->auth_token);
                # or if the web service uses http basic/digest authentication:
                # $self->ua->credentials( ... );
            }
    
            sub get_widgets {
                my ($self) = @_;

        }
    
        my $client = WebService::Foo->new(
            auth_token => 'abc',
            logger     => Log::Tiny->new('/tmp/foo.log'), # optional
            timeout    => 10, # optional, defaults to 10

DESCRIPTION

    This module has been DEPRECATED in favor of WebService::Client. Please
    consider using that instead.

    This module is a base role for quickly and easily creating web service
    clients. Every time I created a web service client, I noticed that I
    kept rewriting the same boilerplate code independent of the web
    service. This module does the boring boilerplate for you so you can
    just focus on the fun part - writing the web service specific code.

    It is important to note that this only supports JSON based web
    services. If your web service does not support JSON, then I am sorry.

METHODS

    These are the methods this role composes into your class. The HTTP
    methods (get, post, put, and delete) will return the deserialized
    response data, assuming the response body contained any data. This will
    usually be a hashref. If the web service responds with a failure, then
    the corresponding HTTP response object is thrown as an exception. This
    exception is simply an HTTP::Response object that can be stringified.
    HTTP responses with a status code of 404 or 410 will not result in an
    exception. Instead, the corresponding methods will simply return undef.
    The reasoning behind this is that GET'ing a resource that does not
    exist does not warrant an exception.

 get

        $client->get('/foo')

    Makes an HTTP POST request.

 post

        $client->post('/foo', { some => 'data' })

    Makes an HTTP POST request.

 put

        $client->put('/foo', { some => 'data' })

    Makes an HTTP PUT request.

 delete

        $client->delete('/foo')

    Makes an HTTP DELETE request.

 req

        my $req = HTTP::Request->new(...);
        $client->req($req);

    This is called internally by the above HTTP methods. You will usually
    not need to call this explicitly. It is exposed as part of the public
    interface in case you may want to add a method modifier to it. Here is
    a contrived example:

        around req => sub {
            my ($orig, $self, $req) = @_;
            $req->authorization_basic($self->login, $self->password);
            return $self->$orig($req, @rest);
        };

 log

    Logs a message using the provided logger.
