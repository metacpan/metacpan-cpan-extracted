NAME
    Exporter::LexicalVars - export lexical variables

SYNOPSIS
            BEGIN {
                    package MyVars;
                    use Exporter::LexicalVars -setup => {
                            '$pi'   => 3.14159,
                            '$foo'  => sub {
                                    my $ref = shift;
                                    $$ref = "Hello world";
                            },
                    };
            };
        
            use Data::Dumper;
        
            my $pi = 3;
        
            {
                    use MyVars;
                    print Dumper($pi);     # 3.14159
                    print Dumper($foo);    # Hello world
            }
        
            print Dumper($pi);        # 3
        
            {
                    use MyVars qw( $foo );
                    print Dumper($pi);     # 3
                    print Dumper($foo);    # Hello world
            }

DESCRIPTION
    Exports lexical (`my`) variables.

    In the setup hashref, you can provide either non-reference values to
    define in the caller's lexical context, or you can provide initializers as
    coderefs.

    Initializers are called with a reference to the variable which has been
    defined in the caller's lexical context. You can use that reference to not
    just assign it a value, but potentially mark the variable as read-only, or
    tie the variable, or whatever.

    Lexical scalar, array and hash variables are each supported. In the case
    of arrays and hashes, providing `undef` in the setup hashref will
    initialize them to empty, but otherwise you must initialize them with an
    initializer coderef; not a non-reference scalar value.

    Exporter-style "tags" may also be defined:

            BEGIN {
                    package MyVars;
                    use Exporter::LexicalVars -setup => {
                            '$pi'     => sub { ... },
                            '$e'      => sub { ... },
                            ':maths'  => [qw( $pi $e )],
                    };
            };
        
            use MyVars qw( :maths );
            use MyVars -maths;           # this works too

    A tag called `:all` will be automatically set up for you. If your exporter
    is called without any arguments, then it will export a tag called
    `:default` if it exists, or `:all` otherwise.
