    perl Build.PL
    ./Build
    ./Build test
    ./Build install

SYNOPSIS
        use Path::Trim;

        my $path = 'a/b/../.././c/d';
        my $pt = Path::Trim->new();
        $pt->set_directory_separator('/');
        $trimmed_path = $pt->trim_path($path);

DESCRIPTION
    Trims paths containing redundant current directory and parent directory
    entries.

    For example:

        a/b/../.././c/d

    is equivalent to:

        c/d

INTERFACE
    "new()"
        Returns an object of Path::Trim.

    "get_current_directory()"
        Returns the current directory representation.

        Example:

            .

        Defaults to "." if not set with "set_current_directory()".

    "set_current_directory( current_directory )"
        Sets the current directory representation to the value of
        "current_directory".

    "get_parent_directory()"
        Returns the parent directory representation.

        Example:

            ..

        Defaults to ".." if not set with "set_parent_directory()".

    "set_parent_directory( parent_directory )"
        Sets the parent directory representation to the value of
        "parent_directory".

    "get_directory_separator()"
        Returns the directory separator, if it has already been set with
        "set_directory_separator()".

    "set_directory_separator( directory_separator )"
        Sets the directory separator to the value of "directory_separator".

    "trim_path( path )"
        Accepts a path (without volume) and returns the trimmed version. It
        assumes that a directory separator has already been set with
        "set_directory_separator()".

        This is different from "Cwd"'s "abs_path()" in that it does not have
        any filesystem ties.
