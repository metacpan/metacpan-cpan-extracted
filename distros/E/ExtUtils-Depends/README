NAME
    ExtUtils::Depends - Easily build XS extensions that depend on XS
    extensions

SYNOPSIS
            use ExtUtils::Depends;
            $package = new ExtUtils::Depends ('pkg::name', 'base::package')
            # set the flags and libraries to compile and link the module
            $package->set_inc("-I/opt/blahblah");
            $package->set_libs("-lmylib");
            # add a .c and an .xs file to compile
            $package->add_c('code.c');
            $package->add_xs('module-code.xs');
            # add the typemaps to use
            $package->add_typemaps("typemap");
            # install some extra data files and headers
            $package->install (qw/foo.h data.txt/);
            # save the info
            $package->save_config('Files.pm');

            WriteMakefile(
                    'NAME' => 'Mymodule',
                    $package->get_makefile_vars()
            );

DESCRIPTION
    This module tries to make it easy to build Perl extensions that use
    functions and typemaps provided by other perl extensions. This means
    that a perl extension is treated like a shared library that provides
    also a C and an XS interface besides the perl one.

    This works as long as the base (or "producing") extension is loaded with
    the "RTLD_GLOBAL" flag (usually done with a

            sub dl_load_flags {0x01}

    in the main .pm file) if you need to use functions defined in the
    module. That "producing" extension will also need to tell
    ExtUtils::MakeMaker the specific functions to export, with arguments to
    "WriteMakefile" like:

      FUNCLIST => [qw(function_name)],
      DL_FUNCS => { 'Extension::Name' => [] },

    The basic scheme of operation is to collect information about a module
    in the instance, and then store that data in the Perl library where it
    may be retrieved later. The object can also reformat this information
    into the data structures required by ExtUtils::MakeMaker's WriteMakefile
    function.

    For information on how to make your module fit into this scheme, see
    "hashref = ExtUtils::Depends::load (name)".

    When creating a new Depends object, you give it a name, which is the
    name of the module you are building. You can also specify the names of
    modules on which this module depends. These dependencies will be loaded
    automatically, and their typemaps, header files, etc merged with your
    new object's stuff. When you store the data for your object, the list of
    dependencies are stored with it, so that another module depending on
    your needn't know on exactly which modules yours depends.

    For example:

      Gtk2 depends on Glib

      Gnome2::Canvas depends on Gtk2

      ExtUtils::Depends->new ('Gnome2::Canvas', 'Gtk2');
         this command automatically brings in all the stuff needed
         for Glib, since Gtk2 depends on it.

    When the configuration information is saved, it also includes a class
    method called "Inline", inheritable by your module. This allows you in
    your module to simply say at the top:

      package Mymod;
      use parent 'Mymod::Install::Files'; # to inherit 'Inline' method

    And users of "Mymod" who want to write inline code (using Inline) will
    simply be able to write:

      use Inline with => 'Mymod';

    And all the necessary header files, defines, and libraries will be added
    for them.

    The "Mymod::Install::Files" will also implement a "deps" method, which
    will return a list of any modules that "Mymod" depends on - you will not
    normally need to use this:

      require Mymod::Install::Files;
      @deps = Mymod::Install::Files->deps;

METHODS
    $object = ExtUtils::Depends->new($name, @deps)
        Create a new depends object named *$name*. Any modules listed in
        *@deps* (which may be empty) are added as dependencies and their
        dependency information is loaded. An exception is raised if any
        dependency information cannot be loaded.

    $depends->add_deps (@deps)
        Add modules listed in *@deps* as dependencies.

    (hashes) = $depends->get_deps
        Fetch information on the dependencies of *$depends* as a hash of
        hashes, which are dependency information indexed by module name. See
        "load".

    $depends->set_inc (@newinc)
        Add strings to the includes or cflags variables.

    $depends->set_libs (@newlibs)
        Add strings to the libs (linker flags) variable.

    $depends->add_pm (%pm_files)
        Add files to the hash to be passed through ExtUtils::WriteMakefile's
        PM key.

    $depends->add_xs (@xs_files)
        Add xs files to be compiled.

    $depends->add_c (@c_files)
        Add C files to be compiled.

    $depends->add_typemaps (@typemaps)
        Add typemap files to be used and installed.

    $depends->add_headers (list)
        No-op, for backward compatibility.

    $depends->install (@files)
        Install *@files* to the data directory for *$depends*.

        This actually works by adding them to the hash of pm files that gets
        passed through WriteMakefile's PM key.

    $depends->save_config ($filename)
        Save the important information from *$depends* to *$filename*, and
        set it up to be installed as *name*::Install::Files.

        Note: the actual value of *$filename* is unimportant so long as it
        doesn't clash with any other local files. It will be installed as
        *name*::Install::Files.

    hash = $depends->get_makefile_vars
        Return the information in *$depends* in a format digestible by
        WriteMakefile.

        This sets at least the following keys:

                INC
                LIBS
                TYPEMAPS
                PM

        And these if there is data to fill them:

                clean
                OBJECT
                XS

    hashref = ExtUtils::Depends::load (name)
        Load and return dependency information for *name*. Croaks if no such
        information can be found. The information is returned as an
        anonymous hash containing these keys:

        instpath
            The absolute path to the data install directory for this module.

        typemaps
            List of absolute pathnames for this module's typemap files.

        inc CFLAGS string for this module.

        libs
            LIBS string for this module.

        deps
            List of modules on which this one depends. This key will not
            exist when loading files created by old versions of
            ExtUtils::Depends.

        If you want to make module *name* support this, you must provide a
        module *name*::Install::Files, which on loading will implement the
        following class methods:

          $hashref = name::Install::Files->Inline('C');
          # hash to contain any necessary TYPEMAPS (array-ref), LIBS, INC
          @deps = name::Install::Files->deps;
          # any modules on which "name" depends

        An easy way to achieve this is to use the method
        "$depends->save_config ($filename)", but your package may have
        different facilities already.

    $depends->load_deps
        Load *$depends* dependencies, by calling "load" on each dependency
        module. This is usually done for you, and should only be needed if
        you want to call "get_deps" after calling "add_deps" manually.

SUPPORT
  Bugs/Feature Requests
    Version 0.2 discards some of the more esoteric features provided by the
    older versions. As they were completely undocumented, and this module
    has yet to reach 1.0, this may not exactly be a bug.

    This module is tightly coupled to the ExtUtils::MakeMaker architecture.

    trackers (below).
