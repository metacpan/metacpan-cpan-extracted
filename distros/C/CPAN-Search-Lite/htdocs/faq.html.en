<a CLASS="t5" NAME="01">What does this site run on?</a>
</dt>
<dd><p>
The basic machine is a <a href="http://www.linux.org/">linux</a> box. Software
used includes <a href="http://www.mysql.com/">mysql</a>, 
<a href="http://www.apache.org/">Apache</a> and
<a href="http://perl.apache.org/">mod_perl</a>, 
<a href="http://www.template-toolkit.org/">Template-Toolkit</a>,
and, of course, <a href="http://www.perl.com/">Perl</a>. 
The multiplexer used to redirect downloads to (hopefully)
nearby CPAN mirrors is based on 
<a href="http://www.maxmind.com/">GeoIP</a>. The network connection
is provided by the <a href="http://www.uwinnipeg.ca/">
University of Winnipeg</a>.
</p></dd>
<dt>
<a CLASS="t5" NAME="02">Why is &quot;Module X&quot; missing?</a>
</dt>
<dd><p>
Assuming that it has been indexed successfully on
<a href="http://www.cpan.org/">CPAN</a>, and that sufficient time
has elapsed so that the local mirror has picked it up, this may be due
to the distribution following a non-conventional structure.
In particular, it is assumed here that the distribution
unpacks into a subdirectory derived from the name of
the distribution, and that the distribution name and a
valid version string are extractable using Graham Barr's
<a href="http://cpan.uwinnipeg.ca/~gbarr/CPAN-DistnameInfo">
CPAN-DistnameInfo</a> module.
</p></dd>
<dt>
<a CLASS="t5" NAME="03">Why is &quot;Module X&quot; missing, yet it
appears on search.cpan.org?</a>
</dt>
<dd><p>
The indexing used is based on the CPAN indices, which is more
restrictive than what <a href="http://search.cpan.org/">
search.cpan.org</a> uses. Thus, if a
module doesn't appear here, chances are it also will be missing
from tools like <code>CPAN/CPANPLUS</code>. This can be due to
a number of reasons - it may be a development version (indicated
as such with an underscore in the distribution's version number),
or it may not be registered with 
<a href="http://pause.perl.org/">PAUSE</a>, or perhaps
registered but under a different CPAN id. 
Note also that only the most recent versions of distributions
are kept in the database, which thus excludes modules existing only in older
versions of distributions from appearing.
</p></dd>
<dt>
<a CLASS="t5" NAME="04">Why is the documentation for &quot;Module X&quot; missing?</a>
</dt>
<dd><p>
This may be due to problems extracting the pod and/or converting
it into html. Another possibility is that it doesn't
conform to the assumed convention for the <code>NAME</code>
section of the pod that the name of the module is specified.
Finally, it may be that it is present, but not in a
standard location - you can check, for example,
<a href="http://cpan.uwinnipeg.ca/htdocs/libnet/">
http://cpan.uwinnipeg.ca/htdocs/libnet/</a>
for a listing of all documents associated with a given
distribution.
</p></dd>
<dt>
<a CLASS="t5" NAME="05">Why are some, or all, of the package prerequisites missing?</a>
</dt>
<dd><p>
Information for the prerequisites is extracted from a file
<code>META.yml</code> within a distribution. Not all distributions
have this file, as it is generated when making a distribution 
only with relatively recent version
of either <code>ExtUtils::MakeMaker</code> or <code>Module::Build</code>.
</p></dd>
<dt>
<a CLASS="t5" NAME="06">What is the syntax for queries?</a>
</dt>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>A basic query such as for <code>foo bar</code> will search,
depending on the search type specified,
through module names and abstracts, distribution names and
abstracts, or CPAN ids and full names, and return results
matching <i>all</i> query terms specified. In searching through
abstracts, only search terms longer than two letters will be used.
</li><li>
If you wish to exclude a search term from the results,
prepend that term with a minus sign (eg, <code>foo -bar</code>).
</li><li>
Searches may also be made using
<a
href="http://www.mysql.com/documentation/mysql/bychapter/manual_Regexp.html#Regexp">
regular expressions</a> - these are recognized by the appearance
of one or more of the characters <code>^, $, *, +, ?, |</code>
in the query term.
</li></ul>
</dd>
<dt>
<a CLASS="t5" NAME="07">How do I use the Win32 ppm respositories?</a>
</dt>
<dd><p>
Consult the documentation that comes with 
<a href="http://www.activestate.com/">ActivePerl</a>
for general directions for using ppm. The ppm packages
that appear here can be installed with the ppm utility.
For the ActivePerl packages, you should just be able to install
the package as <code>install Package-Name</code> from within
the ppm shell; for the other packages, you may have to
add the indicated location to your list of repositories:
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>http://www.bribes.org/perl/ppm</b>, for
the <i>Perl 5.6/5.8 bribes repository</i></li>
<li><b>http://theoryx5.uwinnipeg.ca/cgi-bin/ppmserver?urn:/PPMServer</b>,
for the <i>uwinnipeg Perl 5.6 repository</i></li>
<li><b>http://theoryx5.uwinnipeg.ca/cgi-bin/ppmserver?urn:/PPMServer58</b> (ActivePerl Builds &lt; 819) /
<b>http://theoryx5.uwinnipeg.ca/ppms/</b> (ActivePerl Builds &gt;= 819),  
for the <i>uwinnipeg Perl 5.8 repository</i></li>
</ul>
<p>
Make sure that you use a repository appropriate for your
Perl version (5.6 repositories for ActivePerl builds 6xx, and
5.8 repositories for ActivePerl builds 8xx). Also note that
the name of the package that appears here, based on the
CPAN distribution name, is the one to use when installing
a package; this often, but not always, corresponds to the
name of the main module in the package.
</p><p>
If you maintain a ppm repository and wish it included in
the database here, at present a <i>summary.ppm</i> summary
file of available ppm packages on the repository is required.
How to generate this is described in a script available in the 
<i>PPM</i> distribution on
<a href="http://www.cpan.org/authors/id/M/MU/MURRAY/">CPAN</a>.
After generating this, please contact
<a href="mailto:randy@theoryx5.uwinnipeg.ca">Randy Kobes</a>
with details of your repository.

<a CLASS="t5" NAME="08">Are there any other search engines for CPAN?</a>
</dt>
<dd>
Yes.
<ul>
<li><a href="http://search.cpan.org/">search.cpan.org</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.perldoc.com/">www.perldoc.com</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://wait.cpan.org/">wait.cpan.org</a>.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt>
<a CLASS="t5" NAME="09">What conventions are employed that may be used for
external links?</a>
</dt>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>A link such as <a href="http://cpan.uwinnipeg.ca/~gbarr">
http://cpan.uwinnipeg.ca/~gbarr</a> will bring up information
on the CPAN author with id <code>GBARR</code>.
</li><li>For information on a particular distribution or
module, use a link such as
<a href="http://cpan.uwinnipeg.ca/dist/libnet">
http://cpan.uwinnipeg.ca/dist/libnet</a> (for distributions)
or <a href="http://cpan.uwinnipeg.ca/module/Net::FTP">
http://cpan.uwinnipeg.ca/module/Net::FTP</a> (for modules).
For distributions, <a href="http://cpan.uwinnipeg.ca/~gbarr/libnet">
http://cpan.uwinnipeg.ca/~gbarr/libnet</a> also can be used,
if you know the CPAN author.
</li><li>
For alphabetical listings of distributions or modules, use
<a href="http://cpan.uwinnipeg.ca/dist/A/">
http://cpan.uwinnipeg.ca/dist/A/</a>
or <a href="http://cpan.uwinnipeg.ca/module/A/">
http://cpan.uwinnipeg.ca/module/A/</a>
for all distributions or modules beginning with a certain letter.
Use
<a href="http://cpan.uwinnipeg.ca/dist/Apache/">
http://cpan.uwinnipeg.ca/dist/Apache/</a>
or <a href="http://cpan.uwinnipeg.ca/module/Apache/">
http://cpan.uwinnipeg.ca/module/Apache/</a>
to list, respectively, distributions matching <code>Apache-*</code>
or modules matching <code>Apache::*</code>. Note the trailing
forward slash in these links.
</li><li>For linking to a category listing, one can use
<a href="http://cpan.uwinnipeg.ca/chapter">
http://cpan.uwinnipeg.ca/chapter</a> for the main chapter headings, 
<a
href="http://cpan.uwinnipeg.ca/chapter/World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI">
http://cpan.uwinnipeg.ca/chapter/World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI</a>
for a specific chapter, and 
<a
href="http://cpan.uwinnipeg.ca/chapter/World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI/Apache">
http://cpan.uwinnipeg.ca/chapter/World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI/Apache</a>
for a subchapter.
</li><li>
Links to documents for particular modules can be made as
<a href="http://cpan.uwinnipeg.ca/htdocs/libnet/Net/FTP.html">
http://cpan.uwinnipeg.ca/htdocs/libnet/Net/FTP.html</a>
for finding the documentation for <code>Net::FTP</code> in the
<code>libnet</code> distribution. Alternatively, one can
use <a href="http://cpan.uwinnipeg.ca/perldoc?Net::FTP">
http://cpan.uwinnipeg.ca/perldoc?Net::FTP</a>.
(this also works for the core perl documentation - for example,
<a href="http://cpan.uwinnipeg.ca/perldoc?perlfaq">
http://cpan.uwinnipeg.ca/perldoc?perlfaq</a>
will bring up the <I>perlfaq</I> documentation).
Note that these documentation links may not
work for all modules, for a variety of reasons, mostly
to do with conventions assumed in the CPAN indices and the
form of the pod documentation found in the distribution.

<a CLASS="t5" NAME="10">I found a problem. Who do I contact?</a>
</dt>
<dd><p>
Please email 
<a href="mailto:randy@theoryx5.uwinnipeg.ca">Randy Kobes</a>
if you encounter problems, including broken documentation
links and errors in translation. Please include details (and links) of what you were
doing when the problem occurred.
<dt>
<a CLASS="t5" NAME="11">Is the source code for running this site available?</a>
</dt>
<dd><p>
Yes. See the <i>CPAN-Search-Lite</i> project on
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/cpan-search/">
SourceForge</a>. A mailing list is available there for asking
questions on setting things up, discussing bugs, and for
proposing enhancements and features. Note that this project is
not intended to &quot;compete&quot; with (the amazing)
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/">search.cpan.org</a>, which
contains a number of features not present here (previous
releases of distributions, <code>grep</code> and <code>diff</code>
capabilities, etc.). One direction this particular code may
take is towards services other than standard web ones (for example,
soap-based tools).
