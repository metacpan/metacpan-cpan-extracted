Revision history for Perl extension Tk::DiffText.

0.19 (2008-03-21)
    * Rerelease to fix fragile archive file. (IZArc 3.81 uses backslashes as 
      path separators instead of forward slashes. This breaks some *nix unzip 
      programs.)

0.18 (2008-03-18)
    * Added support for nagivating differences.
    * Updated documentation to describe how to use with Unicode files.

0.17 (2006-12-02)
    * Clicking in the difference map will re-center the view on that location.
    * Fix to prevent files with incomplete last lines (no \n) from interfering
      with synchronized scrolling.
    * The compare() method now accepts a user-defined key generation function
      via the -keygen argument.

0.16 (2006-11-30)
    * Added scrolled difference map support.
    * Added current view marker to scaled map.

0.15 (2006-11-29)
    * Added scaled difference map.
    * Fixed a bug where stray data in $_ could show up in the first file loaded.

0.14 (2006-11-21)
    * Carp::carp now properly imported into package namespace so warnings
      actually work.
    * load() now clears line number gutter when a file load fails.
    * load() now defaults to input being interpreted as a file name, so 
      attempting to load a non-existant file will cause a "Can't read file..."
      warning instead of a "Don't know how to load from..." one.

0.13 (2006-11-19)
    * Uses less memory. (Diffs now performed directly on contents of ROText
      widgets.) This added a dependency on Tie::Tk::Text (new module).
    * Added load() and compare() methods. diff() now deprecated.
    * Panes are scroll-locked after being compared, unlocked whenever a pane is
      loaded.

0.12 (2006-11-15)
    * Intra-line differences now use the key generation function. (i.e. they
      respect settings to ignore case and whitespace.)

0.11 (2006-11-14)
    * Fix test suite to work better cross platform
    * Initialized gutter width to minimal size on creation
    * Renamed -colors option to -diffcolors

0.10 (2006-11-12)
    * original version released on CPAN
