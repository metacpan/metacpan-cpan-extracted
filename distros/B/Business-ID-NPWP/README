NAME
    Business::ID::NPWP - Parse Indonesian taxpayer registration number
    (NPWP)

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.090 of Business::ID::NPWP (from Perl
    distribution Business-ID-NPWP), released on 2019-11-21.

SYNOPSIS
     use Business::ID::NPWP qw(parse_npwp);

     my $res = parse_npwp(npwp => "02.183.241.5-000.000");

DESCRIPTION
    This module can be used to validate Indonesian taxpayer registration
    number, Nomor Pokok Wajib Pajak (NPWP).

    NPWP is composed of 15 digits as follow:

     ST.sss.sss.C-OOO.BBB

    "S" is a serial number from 0-9 (so far haven't seen 7 and up, but it's
    probably possible).

    "T" denotes taxpayer type code (0 = government treasury [bendahara
    pemerintah], 1-3 = company/organization [badan], 4/6 = invidual
    entrepreneur [pengusaha perorangan], 5 = civil servants [pegawai negeri,
    PNS], 7-9 = individual employee [pegawai perorangan]).

    "sss.sss" is a 6-digit serial code for the taxpayer, probably starts
    from 1. It is distributed in blocks by the central tax office (kantor
    pusat dirjen pajak, DJP) to the local tax offices (kantor pelayanan
    pajak, KPP) throughout the country for allocation to taypayers.

    "C" is a check digit. It is apparently using Luhn (modulus 10) algorithm
    on the first 9 digits on the NPWP.

    "OOO" is a 3-digit local tax office code (kode KPP).

    "BBB" is a 3-digit branch code. 000 means the taxpayer is the sole
    branch (or, for individuals, the head of the family). 001, 002, and so
    on denote each branch.
