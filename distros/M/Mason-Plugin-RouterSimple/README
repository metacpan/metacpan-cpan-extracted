NAME
    Mason::Plugin::RouterSimple - Specify routes for page components

VERSION
    version 0.07

SYNOPSIS
    In a top-level component '/archives.mc':

        <%class>
        route ":section/{year:[0-9]{4}}/{month:[0-9]{2}}";
        </%class>

        Archives for <b><% $.section %></b>
        For the month of <% $.month %>/<% $.year %>

    then `/archives/news/2010/02' outputs

        Archives for <b>news</b>
        For the month of 2010/02

DESCRIPTION
    See Mason::Manual::RequestDispatch for background on how request paths
    get mapped to page components.

    This plugin allows you to parse `$m->path_info' (the remainder of the
    top-level path) using Router::Simple routes.

    It can be used whenever `$m->path_info' is set, i.e. with a dhandler or
    with a partial path.

    Use the `route' keyword to declare routes in a <%class> block. Like
    Router::Simple::connect, `route' takes a string/regex pattern and a
    destination hashref; the latter defaults to `{}' if omitted. e.g.

        <%class>
        route "wiki/:page", { action => "wiki" };
        route "download/*.*", { action => "download" };
        route "blog/{year:[0-9]+}/{month:[0-9]{2}}";
        </%class>

    This plugin overrides the default allow_path_info to return true for any
    component that declares at least one route. For components that do not
    declare a route, you will need to override `allow_path_info' as usual.

    Any named captured arguments, including `splat', are placed in component
    attributes, which are automatically declared (as standard read-write
    attributes) if you do not otherwise declare them.

    If you specify more than one route in a component, they will be tried in
    turn, with the first matching route taking precedence.

    If none of the routes match, the request will be declined; in a web
    context this generally means a 404.

    e.g. Given the route declarations above in a component named '/site.mc',

    *   The URL `/site/wiki/HomePage' will set `$.action = "wiki"' and
        `$.page = "HomePage"'.

    *   The URL `/site/download/ping.mp3' will set `$.action = "download"'
        and `$.splat = ['ping', 'mp3']'.

    *   The URL `/site/blog/2010/02' will set `$.year = "2010"' and `$.month
        = "02"'.

    *   The URLs `/site/other' and `/site/blog/10/02' will result in a
        decline/404.
