NAME

    Dist::Zilla::App::Command::dhmakeperl - use dh-make-perl to generate
    .deb archives from your CPAN package

VERSION

    version 0.007

SYNOPSIS

    Once the package is installed and you have setup the prereqs, you can
    run the following command inside your package folder:

         dzil dhmakeperl

    Once this is done your package will be tested and deb file will be
    generated in the debuild folder for you.

DESCRIPTION

    This is a extension for the Dist::Zilla App that adds a command
    dhmakeperl to your dzil package for compiling your perl modules into
    .deb packages.

    Before you install this package make sure that dh-make-perl is
    installed in your debian/ubuntu system. There are some additional app
    requirements that you might want to install for dh-make-perl to avoid
    annoying warnings from dh-make-perl.

         sudo apt-get install dh-make-perl
         sudo apt-get install apt-file
         sudo apt-file update

    To make sure that your changelog and debian control file is included
    use plugins Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Control::Debian and
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::ChangelogFromGit::Debian in your dist.ini

      the .deb archive.

      * You must have dh-make-perl installed on your system to use this
      command.

      * use sudo apt-get install dh-make-perl to install it on debian and
      ubuntu.

      * The .deb file will be created in the debuild folder, This should
      be added to your .gitignore file.
