NAME
    Image::WordCloud - Create word cloud images

SYNOPSIS
            use Image::WordCloud;
            use File::Slurp;
        
            my $wc = Image::WordCloud->new();
        
            # Add the Gettysburg Address
            my $text = read_file('script/gettysburg.txt');
            $wc->words($text);
        
            # Create the word cloud as a GD image
            my $gd = $wc->cloud();
        
            open(my $fh, '>', 'gettysburg.png');
                    binmode $fh;
                    print $fh $gd->png();
            close($fh);
        
            # See examples/gettysburg.png for how the created image looks.
            # script/gettysburg.pl will create it
        
            # The calls can also be chained like so:
            my $text = read_file('script/gettysburg.txt');
            my $gd = Image::WordCloud->new()
                    ->words($text)
                    ->cloud();

    Create "word cloud" images from a set of specified words, similar to
    http://wordle.net. Font size indicates the frequency with which a word
    is used.

    Colors are generated randomly using Color::Scheme. Fonts can be
    specified or chosen randomly.

FUNCTIONS
  new( ... )
    Accepts a number of parameters to alter the image look.

    * image_size => [$x, $y]
        Sets the size of the image in pixels, accepts an arrayref. Defaults
        to [400, 400].

        NOTE: Non-square images currently can look a little squirrely due to
        how Math::TheodorusSpiral fills a rectangle.

    * word_count => $count
        Number of words to show on the image. Defaults to 70.

    * prune_boring => <1,0>
        Prune "boring", or "stop" words. This module currently only supports
        English stop words (like 'the', 'a', 'and', 'but'). The full list is
        in Image::WordCloud::StopWords::EN

        Defaults to true.

    * font => $name
        Name of font to use. This is passed directly to GD::Text::Align so
        it can either be a string like 'arial', or a full path. However in
        order for non-path font names to work, GD needs an environment
        variable like FONT_PATH or FONT_TT_PATH to be set, or `font_path'
        can be used to set it manually.

    * font_path => $path_to_fonts
        Set where your font .ttf files are located. If this is not
        specified, the path of this module's distribution directory will be
        used via File::ShareDir. Currently this module comes bundled with
        one set of fonts.

    * background => [$r, $g, $b]
        Takes an arrayref defining the background color to use. Defaults to
        [40, 40, 40]

    * border_padding => <$pixels | $percent>
        Padding to leave clear around the edges of the image, either in
        pixels or a percent with '%' sign. Defaults to '5%'

                my $wc = Image::WordCloud->new(border_padding => 20);
                my $wc = Image::WordCloud->new(border_padding => '25%');

        Please note that this affects the speed with which this module can
        fit words into the image. In my tests on the text of the Declaration
        of Independence, bumping the percentage by 5% increments progressed
        like so:

                0%:  15.25s
                5%:  21.50s
                10%: 30.00s
                15%: 63.6s avg

  words(\%words_to_use | \@words | @words_to_use | $words)
    Takes either a hashref, arrayref, array or string.

    If the argument is a hashref, keys are the words, values are their
    count. No further processing is done (we assume you've done it on your
    own).

    If the argument is an array, arrayref, or string, the words are parsed
    to remove non-word characters and turn them lower-case.

  cloud()
    Make the word cloud. Returns a GD::Image.

            my $gd = Image::WordCloud->new()->words(qw/some words etc/)->cloud();
        
            # Spit out the wordlcoud as a PNG
            $gd->png;
        
            # ... or a jpeg
            $gd->jpg;
        
            # Get the dimensions
            $gd->width;
            $gd->height;
        
            # Or anything else you can do with a GD::Image object

  add_stop_words(@words)
    Add new stop words onto the list. Automatically puts words in lowercase.

  width()
    Return wordcloud image width

  height()
    Return wordcloud image height
