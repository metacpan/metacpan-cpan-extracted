CDDB/Fake version 2.00
======================

Sometimes there's no CDDB file available for a piece of music. For
example, when you created a collection of tracks from other albums. In
this case, a text file containing the name of the artist / album,
followed by a mere list of the track titles can be used as a
fall-back.

CDDB::Fake implements a part of the CDDB::File API based on manually
crafted fall-back files.

I've adopted the convention to name files with CDDB data C<.cddb>, and
the fake data C<.nocddb>.

For example, you can cut the results of a search at Gracenote
(cddb.com) and paste it into the file .nocddb. For example:

    Birelli Lagrene / Standards

       1. C'est Si Bon
       2. Softly, As in a Morning Sunrise
       3. Days of Wine and Roses
      ...
      12. Nuages

The titles may be optionally followed by trailing TABs and a MM:SS
time indicator.

A tool is included to generate a fake file from the names of the files
in the directory.
