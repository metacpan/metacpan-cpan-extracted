FrameMaker/FromHTML
===================

Sub-classed from HTML::Parser, FrameMaker::FromHTML
converts (some) HTML files into FrameMaker MIF format, 
compatible with all versions of FrameMaker from v.3 upwards.

Probably has some difficulty with nested tables, and 
likely to be buggy -- particularly if HTML it processes
is not well formed.

The example file, htmltofm.pl, shows one way to handle
this -- by shelling out to a routine to run HTML-Tidy
over the input file before processing it.


INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires 

HTML::Parser
Image::Size

and will really only work properly if you've used
something like HTML-Tidy on your HTML before processing it.
