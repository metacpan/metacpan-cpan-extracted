Template-Benchmark

Template::Benchmark and the associated script benchmark_template_engines
are a pluggable framework for benchmarking the numerous template engines
available on CPAN.

With a range of plugins for different template engines, a number of
different template features that can be chosen from, and a number of
common runtime environments, it allows you to mix-and-match all these
options and automatically figures out which template engines provide
those features and gives you a like-for-like benchmark.

You can generate human-readable reports, or you can save the reports
in JSON format for archiving and machine-readable parsing.

You can also generate a feature-matrix if you're unsure what template
engines support what features.

For template engine authors, it's easy to write a Template::Benchmark
plugin and to bundle it with your distribution.
