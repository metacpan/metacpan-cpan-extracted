=head1 NAME

File::Globstar - Globbing With Double Asterisk Expansion

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use File::Globstar qw(globstar fnmatchstar);

    @files = globstar '**/*.css';
    @files = globstar 'css/**/*.css';
    @files = globstar 'scss/**';

    print "Match!\n" if fnmatchstar '*.pl', 'hello.pl';
    print "Case-insensitive match!\n" 
        if fnmatchstar '*.pl', 'Makefile.PL', ignoreCase => 1;
    
    $re = File::Globstar::translatestar('**/*.css');

    $safe_pattern = quotestar $config_srcdir;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Shortcut: If you want to implement file inclusion or exclusion in the style
of L<.gitignore|https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore>, have a look at 
L<File::Globstar::ListMatch>.

Many globbing implementations have been recently extended to accept the
pattern F<**> in place of a path element.  The double asterisk matches
all files and directories in the current directory and all of its
descendants including the current directory itself (in other words: the
directory F<.> is included in the match, the parent directory F<..> is
not).

The convention is especially popular
in the Node.js ecosystem and is also used by L<git|https://git-scm.com/>
when evaluating ignore patterns (see L<https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore>).

=head2 FUNCTIONS

=over 4

=item B<globstar PATTERN[, DIRECTORY]>

Return all files and directories matching B<PATTERN> in B<DIRECTORY>.
B<DIRECTORY> defaults to the current directory if empty or
undefined.

An invalid B<PATTERN> matches nothing and B<globstar()> returns an empty
list for it.

The function I<only> expand the sequence "**" (at the appropriate) positions.
All other heavy lifting is done by L<File::Glob::bsd_glob()> (which is also
the backend for the standard Perl B<glob> operator <HANDLE>.  

Currently, only the (forward!) slash is accepted as a path separator!

=item B<fnmatchstar PATTERN, STRING[, OPTIONS]>

Returns 1 if B<STRING> matches B<PATTERN>, false otherwise.  If a Perl truthy
value is passed as the optional third argument, case is ignored for the
match.

B<OPTIONS> is an optional hash of named arguments.  The only
supported option is "ignoreCase" at the moment.

Invalid B<PATTERN>s never match.

Unlike B<globstar()>, the function does not rely on L<File::Glob> and is
implemented entirely in Perl.  The semantics of B<PATTERN> are as follows:

=over 8

=item B<*>

A single asterisk stands for zero or more arbitrary characters except for the
slash C</>.

=item B<?>

The question mark stands for exactly one character except for the slash C</>.

=item B<**>

A double asterisk stands for an arbitrary sequence of 0 or more characters.
It is only allowed when preceded by either the beginning of the string or 
a slash.  Likewise it must be followed by a slash or the end of the pattern.

=item B<[RANGE]>, B<[!RANGE]>

A character range or a negated character range that is preceded by an
exclamation mark.  A range cannot be empty.

The following features are supported:

=over 12

=item B<CHARACTER>

By default, all B<CHARACTER>s stand for themselves.

=item B<CHARACTER1-CHARACTER2>

All characters from B<CHARACTER1> to B<CHARACTER2> according to the collation
valid for the currently selected locale.

=item B<[:CLASS:]>

A character class like "[:print:]", "[:upper:]", "[:lower:]".  Example:

    [0-9[:lower:]]

This pattern stands for exactly one character, either one of the ASCII
digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9 or any lowercase character 
(according to the current locale).

=item B<\CHARACTER>

Any character with a special meaning can be escaped with a backslash.

You can include a hyphen in a range by using it as the last character.  You
can include a closing square bracket by using it as the first character.
This is implied by the above rules.

Example:

    []-]

This pattern matches either a closing square bracket "]" or a hyphen "-".

=back

Note that POSIX collation classes (for example "[.ch.]") and POSIX equivalence 
classes (for example "[=a=]") are not supported.  Rationale: B<bsd_glob()>
does not support them and in Perl regular expression character classes they
are currently not supported and their usage throws an exception.

=back

=item B<translatestar PATTERN[, OPTIONS]>

Compiles B<PATTERN> into a Perl regular expression or throws an exception in
case of failure.  This function is used internally by B<fnmatchstar()>.

B<OPTIONS> is an optional hash of named arguments.  The only
supported option is "ignoreCase" at the moment.

=item B<quotestar STRING[, NEGATABLE]>

Escapes all characters special to globstar patterns.  This are:

=over 8

=item B<\\> the backslash

=item B<*> the asterisk/star

=item B<[> the opening square bracket

=item B<]> the closing square bracket (actually unneeded but ...)

=back

If the optional argument B<NEGATABLE> is truthy, a leading exclamation mark
will also be backslash-escaped.

=back

=head2 EXAMPLES

First, let's look at some examples for the double asterisk pattern.

=over 4

=item B<**/*.css>

All files matching the name F<*.css> in the current directory and all its
descendants, for example F<main.css>, F<styles/body.css>, 
F<styles/body/footer.css>, F<styles/footer/whatever.css> and so on.

=item B<src/**>

The directory F<src> and all files and directories underneath F<src>, for
example F<src/a>, F<src/b>, F<src/a/x/y>, and so on.

=item B<src/**/*.c>

All F<*.c> files in the directory F<src> or one if its descendants, for
example F<src/file.c>,  F<src/a/file.c>, F<src/b/file.c>, F<src/a/x/file.c>,
and so on. 

=back

=head2 GORY DETAILS

The function B<globstar()> is a wrapper around B<bsd_glob> (see
L<File::Glob>) that extends the functionality with the double asterisk
semantics.  A double asterisk is only allowed in the following cases:

=over 4

=item B<F<**/>...>

At the beginning of a pattern, when followed by a slash.

=item F<...B</**/>...>

Anywhere inside a pattern, when preceded and followed by a slash.

=item B<...F</**>>

At the end of a pattern, when preceded by a slash.

=item B<F<**>>

The pattern F<**> expands to all files and directories in the current
directory with arbitrary nesting level.

All other usages of two consecutive asterisks are considered illegal.  An
illegal pattern does not match any file.  The file F<foo***bar> for example
does I<not> match the pattern F<foo***bar>.  It matches, however,
F<foo\*\*\*bar>.

Of course, all other features of L<File::Glob::bsd_glob()> are supported
as well.  The module also suffers from the same bugs and incompatibilities.

=back

=head1 BUGS AND CAVEATS

Other than the ones currently unknown, be prepared for the following:

=over 4

=item B<COMPATIBILITY>

The module assumes that the (forward!) slash "/" is the only valid path
separator.  Especially the backslash "\\" is only used for escaping and
never as a path separator.  On the other hand, the underlying function
B<bsd_glob()> from B<File::Glob> I<does> support other path separators than
a slash.

This behavior may change in the future.  The main reason why the backslash
is not supported as a path separator is that I have no idea how B<bsd_glob()> 
behaves exactly, for example under Windows.  Patches are welcome!

=item B<UNIFORM BEHAVIOR OF GLOBSTAR() AND FNMATCHSTAR()>

The functions should theoretically behave accordingly.  If B<globstar()>
returns a filename for a certain pattern, then B<fnmatchstar()> should
return true for the same pattern and the filename passed as a string.

Unfortunately, the two implementations are completely independent, and this
cannot be guaranteed.  Please file a bug if you find a discrepancy.

=item B<CASE-INSENSITIVE FILE SYSTEMS>

The behavior of B<globstar()> completely depends on the behavior of 
the underlying L<File::Glob>.  For B<fnmatchstar()> you can pass a third
argument specifying whether the match should be done case-insensitively or
not.

For real-world scenarios you should be aware that on non-Windows systems,
every directory level could behave differently: While "/media/disk1/backup"
can be case-sensitive, "/media/disk1/backup/data" could be case-preserving
and "/media/disk2/mp3" could be case-insensitive.
