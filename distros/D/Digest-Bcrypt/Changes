    * Remove accidental dependency on perl 5.10
      introduced in previous revision

    [ FEATURE ]
    * bcrypt_b64digest method added to return digest
      base64 encoded using the base 64 alphabet commonly
      used with bcrypt

    * b64digest method now returns a base64 that is
      compatible with the standard MIME alphabet.
