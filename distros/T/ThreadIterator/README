CHANGES

0.1  13 Aug 1998
Initial release.

INSTALLATION

You need Perl 5.005 or later with thread support configured
(Configure -Dusethreads). This module consists of a single Perl module
(no XS code) but still uses Makefile.PL so that it installs
automatically into the right library directory and manifies the pod
documentation from the module.

To build:
    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make install
