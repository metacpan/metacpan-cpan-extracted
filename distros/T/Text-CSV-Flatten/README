Text-CSV-Flatten version 0.04
=============================

This module transforms hierarchical data (nested arrays/hashes) to
comma-separated value (csv) output according to a compact, readable,
user-specified pattern.

For example, the pattern '.<index>.*' transforms a data structure
of the form

    [{ a => 1, b => 2 }, { a => 3, b => 4 }]

to the CSV output

    a,b,index
    1,2,0
    3,4,1

The pattern '.*.*' applied to the same data gives the output

    0_a,0_b,1_a,1_b
    1,2,3,4

The pattern '.*.<key>' gives the output

    0,1,key
    1,3,a
    2,4,b

It is hoped that the pattern specification is sufficiently powerful for this
module to replace a lot of simple boiler-plate data transformations.

PATTERN SPECIFICATION
---------------------

The dot-separated components represent the following:

- `<name>` represents that the keys at that position should be put in a column
  named name in the csv output. The values belonging to those keys become rows;
- `*` represents that the keys at that position in the pattern should be
  interpreted as column names; their values should be the values for that
  column, all beloning to the same row;
- `{column_name}` or `{column_name_1,column_name_2,...}` is similar to `*`, but
  instead of capturing all the keys at that level of the hierarchy, it only
  captures the named columns.
- anything else represents a literal key name.
- If your pattern does not contain `*` or `{...}`, you need to pass an
  additional `column_name =>` parameter to the constructor to specify the name
  for the single column where the value will go.

For the purposes of this description, an array should be seen as a collection
of index => value pairs.

It is possible to specify several dot-separated paths in a single pattern,
separated by spaces. In that case, all the paths need to have the same primary
key (that is, the same set of names in `<...>`). Rows will be formed by joining
the columns resulting from the different paths.
