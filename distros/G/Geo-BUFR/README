Geo::BUFR
=========

Library for handling of WMO (World Meteorological Organization) BUFR
files.


INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

This will install the module in the standard locations. You will most
probably require root privileges to install in standard system
directories. To install in a non-standard directory like /home/cpan,
specify a prefix during the 'perl Makefile.PL' stage:

   perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/home/cpan

After installing, in order for Perl to find the module when executing
programs, you are adviced to modify the environment variable $PERL5LIB,
e.g.

   export PERL5LIB=/home/cpan/lib/perl/5.8.4:$PERL5LIB

(or the corresponding command for your operating system and Perl version).

You will need a C compiler which supports variable length arrays. This
is standard on Unix-like systems. On Windows I recommend using
Strawberry Perl, in which case you should type 'dmake' instead of
'make' when installing.

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules, all of which are expected to
be part of a standard Perl distribution:

Carp, Config, DynaLoader, FileHandle, File::Spec::Functions,
Getopt::Long, Pod::Usage, Scalar::Util, Storable, Test::More,
Time::Local

DESCRIPTION

BUFR = Binary Universal Form for the Representation of meteorological
data. BUFR is becoming the standard exchange format for meteorological
observations. This module provides methods for decoding and encoding
BUFR messages, and for displaying information in BUFR B and D tables
and in BUFR flag and code tables. The core routines for encoding and
decoding bitstreams are implemented in C.

This module also installs some example programs: bufrread.pl,
bufrresolve.pl, bufrencode.pl, bufr_reencode.pl and bufralter.pl. See
https://wiki.met.no/bufr.pm/start for examples of use.
