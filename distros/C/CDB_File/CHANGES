Revision history for Perl extension CDB_File.

0.99 - J. Nick Koston <bdraco@cpan.org> 2016-07-16
    - Add a fetch_all function for 1:1 hash mapping

0.98 - Todd Rinaldo <toddr@cpan.org> 2015-06-30
    - Replace use vars with our (deprecated since 5.6.0)
    - Switch from Dynaloader to XSLoader as it's known to be a lower memory profile module.

0.97_01 - Todd Rinaldo <toddr@cpan.org> 2011-04-05
    - Put ppport.h back in with an updated version.
    - ppport.h warnings now indicate that the module is not perl 5.6 compatible,
      but the test suite continues to succeed there. p5p suggests dropping support
      for 5.6

0.97 - Todd Rinaldo <toddr@cpan.org> 2011-04-05
    - CPAN testers looks relativley clean. Publishing a stable version.

0.96_02 - Todd Rinaldo <toddr@cpan.org> 2011-04-03
    - Perl 5.6 doesn't warn about $x{undef}. Skip this test for 5.6

0.96_01 - Todd Rinaldo <toddr@cpan.org> 2011-04-01
    - Remove ppport.h from distro on reccommendation from ppport.h
    - Remove C99 style code from CDB_File to allow GCC 2.95 compilers to work
    - Modernize Makefile.PL and require Test::More
    - Update tests to use Test::More
    - Fix makefile - {'d_mmap'}  isn't always defined
    - Cleanup temp files during testing
    - Untie before file removal so windows doesn't block the removal

0.96
    - Fix for compiling under stricter compilers

0.95
    - Support passing multiple key/value pairs to ->insert() for performance
      when building CDBs.

0.94
    - Made work on perl 5.8.1
    - Added some notes about performance

0.93
    - Switched to allocating memory on the heap. I have no idea how the
      previous scheme worked at all. It should have fallen over everywhere.

      about calling NEXT before calling FIRST.
