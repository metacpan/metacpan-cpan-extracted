NAME

    Test2::Tools::PerlCritic - Testing tools to enforce Perl::Critic
    policies

VERSION

    version 0.03

SYNOPSIS

     use Test2::V0;
     use Test2::Tools::PerlCritic;
     
     perl_critic_ok 'lib', 'test library files';
     perl_critic_ok 't',   'test test files';
     
     done_testing;

DESCRIPTION

    Test for Perl::Critic violations using Test2. Although this testing
    tool uses the Test2 API instead of the older Test::Builder API, the
    primary motivation is to provide output in a more useful form. That is
    policy violations are grouped by policy class, and the policy class
    name is clearly displayed as a diagnostic. The author finds the former
    more useful because he tends to address one type of violation at a
    time. The author finds the latter more useful because he tends to want
    to lookup or adjust the configuration of the policy as he is addressing
    violations.

FUNCTIONS

 perl_critic_ok

     perl_critic_ok $file_or_directory, \@options, $test_name;
     perl_critic_ok $file_or_directory, \%options, $test_name;
     perl_critic_ok $file_or_directory, $critic, $test_name;
     perl_critic_ok $file_or_directory, $test_name;
     perl_critic_ok $file_or_directory;

    Run Perl::Critic on the given file or directory. If \@options or
    \%options are provided, then they will be passed into the Perl::Critic
    constructor. If $critic (an instance of Perl::Critic) is provided, then
    that Perl::Critic instance will be used instead of creating one
    internally. Finally the $test_name may be provided if you do not like
    the default test name.

    Only a single test is run regardless of how many files are processed.
    this is so that the policy violations can be grouped by policy class
    across multiple files.

    As a convenience, if the test passes then a true value is returned.
    Otherwise a false will be returned.

    done_testing or the equivalent is NOT called by this function. You are
    responsible for calling that yourself.

CAVEATS

    Test::Perl::Critic has been around longer, and probably does at least
    some things smarter. The fact that this module groups policy violations
    for all files by class means that it has to store more diagnostics in
    memory before sending them out en masse, where as Test::Perl::Critic
    sends violations for each file as it processes them. Test::Perl::Critic
    also comes with some code to optionally do processing in parallel. Some
    of these issues may or may not be addressed in future versions of this
    module.

    Since this module formats it's output the -verbose option is ignored at
    the set_format value is ignored.
