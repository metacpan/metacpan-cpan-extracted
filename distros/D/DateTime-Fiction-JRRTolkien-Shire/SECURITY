How to Report a Security Vulnerability
=== == ====== = ======== =============

Security vulnerabilities can be reported by e-mail to the current
project maintainer at WYANT AT cpan DOT org.

Please include as many details as possible, including code samples or
test cases, so that we can reproduce the issue.  Check that your report
does not expose any sensitive data, such as passwords, tokens, or
personal information.

If you would like any help with triaging the issue, or if the issue is
being actively exploited, please copy the report to the CPAN Security
Group (CPANSec) at cpan-security@security.metacpan.org.

Please DO NOT use the public issue reporting system on RT or GitHub
issues for reporting security vulnerabilities.

Please do not disclose the security vulnerability in public forums until
past any proposed date for public disclosure, or it has been made public
by the maintainers or CPANSec.  That includes patches or pull requests.

For more information, see "Report a Security Issue",
https://security.metacpan.org/docs/report.html on the CPANSec website.

Response to Reports
======== == =======

The maintainer aims to acknowledge your security report as soon as
possible.  However, this project is maintained by a single person in his
spare time, and he cannot guarantee a rapid response.  If you have not
received a response within a week, then please send a reminder and copy
the report to CPANSec at cpan-security@security.metacpan.org.

Please note that the initial response to your report will be an
acknowledgement, with a possible query for more information.  It will
not necessarily include any fixes for the issue.

The project maintainer may forward this issue to the security contacts
for other projects where he believe it is relevant.  This may include
embedded libraries, system libraries, prerequisite modules or downstream
software that uses this software.

He may also forward this issue to CPANSec.

Which Software this Policy Applies to
===== ======== ==== ====== ======= ==

Any security vulnerabilities in DateTime-Fiction-JRRTolkien-Shire are
covered by this policy.

Security vulnerabilities are considered anything that allows users to
execute unauthorised code, access unauthorised resources, or to have an
adverse impact on accessibility or performance of a system.

Security vulnerabilities in upstream software (embedded libraries,
prerequisite modules or system libraries, or in Perl), are not covered
by this policy unless they affect DateTime-Fiction-JRRTolkien-Shire, or
DateTime-Fiction-JRRTolkien-Shire can be used to exploit vulnerabilities
in them.

Security vulnerabilities in downstream software (any software that uses
DateTime-Fiction-JRRTolkien-Shire, or plugins to it that are not
included with the DateTime-Fiction-JRRTolkien-Shire distribution) are
not covered by this policy.

Supported Versions of Covered Software
========= ======== == ======= ========

The maintainer will only commit to releasing security fixes for the
latest version of DateTime-Fiction-JRRTolkien-Shire.

Note that the DateTime-Fiction-JRRTolkien-Shire project only supports
production versions of Perl at of above the version indicated in the
metadata. If a security fix requires me to increase the minimum version
of Perl that is supported, then I may do so.

Installation and Usage Issues
============ === ===== ======

The distribution metadata specifies minimum versions of prerequisites
that are required for DateTime-Fiction-JRRTolkien-Shire to work.
However, some of these prerequisites may have security vulnerabilities,
and you should ensure that you are using up-to-date versions of these
prerequisites.

Where security vulnerabilities are known, the metadata may indicate
newer versions as recommended.

Usage
=====

Please see the software documentation for further information.
