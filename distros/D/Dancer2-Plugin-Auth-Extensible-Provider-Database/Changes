    * Split out Dancer2::Plugin::Auth::Extensible::Provider::Database from
      the Dancer2::Plugin::Auth::Extensible distribution.
    * Provider is now a Moo class and has been rehacked to be compatible
      with Plugin2. This means thus provider is not compatible with Dancer2
      releases <= v0.166001.
