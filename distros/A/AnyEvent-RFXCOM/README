NAME
    AnyEvent::RFXCOM - Perl modules for RFXCOM RF receivers/transmitters
    with AnyEvent

VERSION
    version 1.142240

SYNOPSIS
      # see AnyEvent::RFXCOM::RX (and corresponding example script
      # rfxcom-anyevent-rx) and see Device::RFXCOM::TX (and example script
      # rfxcom-anyevent-tx)

DESCRIPTION
    AnyEvent modules to support RF receivers and transmitters produced by
    RFXCOM, <http://www.rfxcom.com/>. This code is derived from code written
    for the xPL-Perl project at <http://www.xpl-perl.org.uk/>.

    A bonus module is provided to support W800 RF receivers from
    <http://www.wgldesigns.com/>. These receivers recognize fewer RF
    protocols.

    These devices are typically used for home automation and sensor
    monitoring applications.

THANKS
    Special thanks to RFXCOM, <http://www.rfxcom.com/>, for their excellent
    documentation and for giving me permission to use it to help me write
    this code. I own a number of their products and highly recommend them.
