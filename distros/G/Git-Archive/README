NAME
    Git::Archive - For automated file archiving with Git

SYNOPSIS
      use Git::Archive;
      Git::Archive->commit({ msg => "Committing files", files => [qw/foo bar/] });

DESCRIPTION
    When you want to have code maintain a file archive by committing changes
    to a Git repo, you don't have the luxury of being lazy and simply
    telling the code to do:

      git pull
      git commit changes
      git push

    Many little things can go wrong:

    What if files are already staged when your code goes to commit its
    changes?
    What if there are conflicts on pull?
    What if the world ends?

    This is a module that helps you not have to care about such questions!
    (Two out of three ain't bad)

    The goal is to allow you to simply call the commit method, and know that
    you'll get a useful error and safe recovery to a working state, whatever
    goes wrong.

  Arguments:
   msg
    Commit message. This one is mandatory.

   files
    List of filenames to commit. Necessary unless you specify all_tracked or
    all_dirty. Can be either a string of space-separated filenames, or an
    arrayref of filename strings. If any of the filenames will contain a
    space, you must use the arrayref option. Otherwise, use whichever you
    prefer.

   error
    Default behaviour for errors is to just dump them to STDERR.

    If you want something more exciting (like email!) supply a subref here.

   Error sub arguments:
    $args
        Hashref, mostly the arguments you passed in when calling the commit
        method

    $error
        String containing the actual error message

   success
    If you want to execute some code upon successful commit supply the
    function here

   Success sub arguments:
    $args
        Hashref, mostly the arguments you passed in when calling the commit
        method

   all_tracked
    If you want to simply commit all tracked files, set this to be true

   all_dirty
    If you want to commit all changes in the directory, tracked or not, set
    this to be true

   use_remote
    If you want to push to a remote, set this to the name of the remote
    (You'll typically want this to be 'origin')

   check_all_staged
    If you want to make sure every file supplied in the 'files' arg is
    staged before committing, set this to be true: It will then throw an
    error if the file was unchanged/doesn't exist

   git_dir
    If you want to use a directory other than the current one as your repo,
    specify it here

    Note: If your git-controlled dir is ./foo and you want to commit the
    file ./foo/bar/baz then ( git_dir => './foo', files => 'bar/baz' )

   sudo
    If you want to call git as a different user via sudo, specify that user
    here
