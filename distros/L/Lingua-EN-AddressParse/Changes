Revision history for Perl CPAN module Lingua::EN::AddressParse

1.27 05 Jan 2018
    Stopped errors from undefined base_satreet_name componet. Giothub issue reported by Bill Baker
    Allowed for house names at start of address, such as 'Manor House 12 Smith St...
    Added more street types
    Removed Island as a street type, too many clashes with Island appearing in other components
    Added extra test case to main.t for street direction prefix

1.26 15 Sep 2016
    the auto_clean option now standardises more street types, sub property types and identifiers
    added more street names, types and sub property identifier patterns
    Directional streets (like East St) given higher matching priority
    Fixed bug in synopsis example
    Improved documentation


1.25 12 Jul 2016
    Used github as repository
    Improved documentation

1.24 11 Jun 2015
    The case_components method has been removed, only the components method is needed (due to change to using upper case grammar in version 1.22)
        an optional flag allows for all components to be upper cased
    Allow for numeric avenues with optional fraction, such as 'Avenue 12 1/2'
    Added cases such as 'VIA CAPRI', to the street noun pattern
    Allow for property numbers of form xy.5
    Extract any building, level, floor data prior to parsing and save as separate attributes
       

1.23 20 Apr 2015
    Allowed for 4 word suburb names
    Introduced street_noun pattern, no need to name all 'The Corso, Avenue...' instances
    Detect vowels sounds in suburb words
    No vowel sound in street or suburb now raises a warning, not an error in properties hash
    Related to the above, added a 'warning_desc' component to address object
    Sub property portion of identifier now correctly assigned, so '2/24A' has sub_property_id => 2, property_id => 24A
    Added sub_proprty_type components, such as "Unit", "Apt" etc
    Allowed for half street numbers, such has '45 1/2 Some St;
    Refactored some repetitive code sections
        
1.22 21 Jan 2015
    fold all text to upper case prior to parsing, regexp matching is faster if case insensitive
    use extended regexp (/x) for better readability
    added many more valid street combinations
    allowed for prefix before ordinal street, such as "Bay 24th Street"
    folded 'The Avenue' type of street back into main street grammar, removed street_noun grammar
    NOTE: component 'street' changed to 'street_name' for clarity
    added street_direction_prefix component
    added base_street_name component (street name less direction prefix)
    auto_clean option now removes full stops, so P.O. Box 12 => PO Box 12, grammar no longer accepts full stops

1.21 14 Oct 2014
    allowed for more untyped streets such as 'Avenue C', 'State Route 19'
    more transformations added to the _clean function

1.20 22 Jul 2014
    added person's street name such as 'Dr Martin Luther King Jr'

    new component added, po_box_type to describe type of post box,
      so 'PO BOX 123 Newtown Private Boxes WA 6865' will return
      suburb of Newtown and po_box_type of Private Boxes

    fixed incorrect error descriptions on parsing error
    added more sub property identifiers
    added more street types
    detect missing mandatory country parameter in arguments to 'new' method
    auto_clean now removes full stops (as in P.O. Box, Rd. etc), simplifies grammar

    auto_clean always cleans string, not just on parsing error
    during auto_clean, spaces now removed in sub property identifer, such as 1 A Main St -> 1A Main St

    added street name such as 'John F Kennedy Boulevard'
    post codes can now be optional with the force_post_code argument

    Keep street direction in all capitals when casing components
    _validate now checks for PO box format


1.16 20 Jan 2011

    Added new address type 'road_box'. This allows for box identifier such as RMB,
    optionally street name and type, then suburb and post code.

    Sub property values are now returned as as separate component sub_property_identifier,
      not as part of the property_identifier component

    Created a better grammar for property_identifier
    Removed incorrect validity tests that were not accounting for ordinal street types
    Fixed auto_clean option so that numbers are retained in ordinal street types!
    Expanded and improved documentation and comments
