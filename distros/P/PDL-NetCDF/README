PDL::NetCDF, version 4.01

Allows reading and writing of NetCDF files into and out of PDL objects using
a simple object-oriented interface.  NetCDF is a flexible, binary, portable
file standard for storing gridded data.  One can access netCDF files through
interface libraries in FORTRAN, C/C++ and perl.  Numerous utilities also exist
for manipulating these files.

The following are required for installation:

-- PDL v2.0.3+ (MUST have PDL::Char module to work!)

If you want to use the old version of pdl (pdl 1.11), please
use PDL::NetCDF version 0.34, also available on CPAN.  

-- perl 5.004 (or later)
-- NetCDF version 3, NetCDF version 4

The first two are available on CPAN.  The third is available from UCAR UNIDATA 
at

INSTALLATION:

Installation should be the normal:

perl Makefile.PL
make
make test

(as root)
make install

For building against the NetCDF4 library with hdf5 data-support:

NETCDF_EXTRALIBS='-L/disk1/heiko/local/hdf5_1.8/lib -lhdf5_hl -lhdf5 -lz' perl Makefile.PL
make
make test

(as root)
make install


If you have problems, see the PROBLEMS file.

Best of luck!
