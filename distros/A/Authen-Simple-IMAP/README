NAME
    Authen::Simple::IMAP - Simple IMAP and IMAPS authentication

SYNOPSIS

            host => 'imap.example.com',

        );

        if ( $imap->authenticate( $username, $password ) ) {
               # successful authentication
        }

         # or as a mod_perl Authen handler

         PerlModule Authen::Simple::Apache

             AuthType          Basic
             AuthName          "Protected Area"

DESCRIPTION
    Authenticate against IMAP or IMAPS services.

    Requires Net::IMAP::Simple for IMAP and Net::IMAP::Simple::SSL for
    IMAPS. These modules are loaded when the object is created, not at
    compile time.

METHODS
    * new
        This method takes a hash of parameters. The following options are
        valid:

        * host  The hostname of the IMAP server

        * protocol
                Either 'IMAP' or 'IMAPS'. Any other value causes an
                exception. Selecting 'IMAPS' will cause an exception if
                Net::IMAP::Simple::SSL is not installed.

        * log   Any object that supports "debug", "info", "error" and
                "warn".

                        log => Log::Log4perl->get_logger('Authen::Simple::PAM')

        * escape_slash
                In some environments, a password containing a slash will
                fail unless the slash is escaped. Set escape_slash to true
                to escape slashes in passwords, or false to leave them
                unescaped. This is true by default.

        * imap  Any object that supports "login" and "errstr" methods. The
                obvious choice being a Net::IMAP::Simple object, but if you
                want to use something else, here's how you can do it. This
                is how I use a mock imap object for the unit tests.

    * authenticate( $username, $password )
        Returns true on success and false on failure.

DEPENDENCIES
    Net::IMAP::Simple is required, and Net::IMAP::Simple::SSL is required
    for IMAPS. Net::IMAP::Simple::Plus adds some patches to the otherwise
    abandoned and broken Net::IMAP::Simple, so I recommend it.

BUGS AND LIMITATIONS
    *   I've never tried this in mod_perl, so including the mod_perl example
        in the synopsis is pure hubris on my part.

    *   The unit tests are pretty sparse. They don't include any tests
        against real IMAP servers. They just do a successful and failed
        password against a mock imap server object.

    *   This module uses Net::IMAP::Simple, which is broken and abandoned. I
        should either use something else or implement the IMAP stuff myself.
        I wound up wrapping the Net::IMAP::Simple stuff in an alarm+eval
        block to get it to behave.

CREDITS
    *   I pretty much ripped the best parts of this doc out of Christian
        Hansen's Authen::Simple::PAM and replaced "pam" with "imap" in a few
        places. The lousy parts are my own.
