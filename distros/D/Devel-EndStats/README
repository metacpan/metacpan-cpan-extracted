DESCRIPTION

    Devel::EndStats runs in the END block, displaying various statistics
    about your program, such as:

      * how many seconds the program ran;

      * how many required files and total number of lines loaded (from
      %INC);

      * etc.

    Some notes/caveats:

    Devel::EndStats should be loaded before other modules, for example by
    running it on the command-line, as shown in the SYNOPSIS.

OPTIONS

    Some options are accepted. They can be passed via the use statement:

     # from the command line
     % perl -MDevel::EndStats=verbose,1 script.pl
    
     # from script
     use Devel::EndStats verbose=>1;

    or via the DEVELENDSTATS_OPTS environment variable:

     % DEVELENDSTATS_OPTS='verbose=1' perl -MDevel::EndStats script.pl

      * verbose => BOOL (default: 0)

      Can also be set via VERBOSE environment variable. If set to true,
      display more statistics (like per-module statistics).

      * sort => STR (default: '-time')

      Set how to sort the list of loaded modules ('file' = by file, 'time'
      = by load time, 'caller' = by first caller's package, 'order' = by
      order of loading, 'lines' = by number of lines). Only relevant when
      'verbose' is on.

      * force => BOOL (default: 0)

      By default, if BEGIN phase did not succeed, stats will not be shown.
      This option forces displaying the stats.

      * hide_core => BOOL (default: 0)

      Whether to hide core modules while listing modules in verbose mode.

      * hide_noncore => BOOL (default: 0)

      Whether to hide non-core modules while listing modules in verbose
      mode.

      * show_memsize => BOOL (default: 0)

      Whether to show memory usage information. Currently this is done by
      probing /proc/$$/statm because some other memory querying modules are
      unusable (e.g. Devel::SizeMe currently segfaults on my system,
      Devel::InterpreterSize is too heavy).

FAQ

 What is the purpose of this module?

    This module might be useful during development. I first wrote this
    module when trying to reduce startup overhead of a command line
    application, by looking at how many modules the app has loaded and try
    to avoid loading modules whenever it's unnecessary.

 Can you add (so and so) information to the stats?

    Sure, if it's useful. As they say, (comments|patches) are welcome.

SEE ALSO

    There are many modules on CPAN that can be used to generate dependency
    information for your code. Neil Bowers has written a review
    <http://neilb.org/reviews/dependencies.html> that covers most of them.

KNOWN ISSUES

    * Timing and memory usage is inclusive instead of exclusive.
