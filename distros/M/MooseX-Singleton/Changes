      the test)

0.27 2011-05-19
    - Fix 006-cooperative.t - this test requires MooseX::StrictConstructor
      0.16+ to pass with Moose 2.00+. Reported by Alexandr Ciornii. RT
      #67965. (Dave Rolsky)

0.26 2011-02-26
    - This module will now work with Moose 1.9900+, but it still works with
      older Moose as well. (Dave Rolsky)

    - The test suite now uses Test::Fatal instead of Test::Exception. (Karen
      Etheridge)

    - Fixes for latest Moose. (Dave Rolsky)

0.24 2010-07-15

    - Use modern Moose APIs to avoid warnings from the next Moose. (Dave
      Rolsky)

0.22 2009-12-25
    - The ->initialize method was both broken and undocumented. RT
      #51260. (Dave Rolsky)
    - Updated docs to encourage use of ->instance and ->initialize, and
      discourage calling ->new directly. Doing so may be deprecated in a
      future release. (Dave Rolsky)

0.21 2009-09-12
    - Various modules in this class were trying to load the old pre-0.20
      classes, which have all been renamed. Tests passed if you had 0.19 or
      earlier installed, but failed for fresh installations. (Dave Rolsky)

0.20 2009-09-11
    - Converted this extension to use roles rather than metaclass
      subclasses. This means it will cooperate with other extensions on CPAN,

    - Fixed to work with Moose 0.73_01

    - When an object was implicitly constructed by calling
      ClassName->attribute, it skipped the BUILD and BUILDARGS defined

      Rolsky)
