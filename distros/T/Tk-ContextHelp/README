Tk::ContextHelp

Tk::ContextHelp provides context-sensitive help for perl/Tk widgets.
You can attach help topics to widgets, similar to Tk::Balloon. Help
topics may be short messages or a link to a pod file.

Note that this module needs the Tk::InputO extension, which does not
work with Win32.

To install, type

	$ perl Makefile.PL
	$ make
	$ make test
	$ make install

To start an sample script, type

	$ env BATCH=0 make test

Additional requirements (it's not essential, but recommended):
Tk-Pod-0.11.tar.gz or better.
