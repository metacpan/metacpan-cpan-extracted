1.26 2010-04-09
    [Bug fixes]
    * Handle NULL columns in concatenation as empty strings

    [Improvements]
    * Change regex's in parser to use \p{Word} instead of \w to allow unicode

      to SQL::Dialects (patch from Michael Schwern)

    [Things that may break your code]
    * SQL::Parser now didn't deliver a struct containing 'column_names',
      'computed_columns' and 'set_functions' - it's combined into one member
      'column_defs'.
    * Minimum required perl version is now 5.8 - upcoming next version of DBI
      requires perl 5.8, too - and I could simplify some code that's why

1.21_3 2009-09-17
    [Things that may break your code]
    * When someone accesses the where_clause attribute of the SQL::Statement
      instance - be aware that now IN and BETWEEN can be native entries

    [Bug fixes]
    * convert operation to upper case when surely initialized

      first run
      Thanks to Alexander Breibach <alexander.breibach@gmx.de> -- Jens

1.15 2006-02-02
    * fixed placeholder bug in SQL::Statement::UPDATE
      thanks for bug report Tanktalus

    * added support for GROUP BY
      (several people sent suggestions for this in the past, please email me
      so I can credit you, sorry I lost the names)
    * added support for true LIMIT - if a LIMIT clause is specified and
      no ORDER BY clause is specified, the SELECT will stop searching
      when the limit is reached;  with an ORDER BY clause it will still
      search the entire table because we can only ORDER a set;  using
      LIMIT without an ORDER BY will greatly increase speed

    * added backwards compatiblity: both SQL::Statement and
      SQL::Parser now work in perl version 5.004 and above.
    * changed defaults for DBD::CSV so it now accepts new SQL
      without adding extra flags to scripts
    * added support for SQL comments
    * added support for temporary tables and on commit clauses in
      CREATE statements and drop behaviour flags in DROP statements
      (SQL::Parser only, not supported by SQL::Statement)
    * fixed bugs in qualified column names (e.g. tableA.*), and in
      joins using ON or WHERE

1.001 2002-01-17
    * Fixed bug in UPDATE that caused the new value to be a hash
      rather than a scalar.

1.0 2002-01-15
    This is the first CPAN release of the pure perl version of the
    module.  It was previously released in an XS version by Jochen
    Wiedman who has turned over maintenance of it to me.

    The new Pure Perl version of SQL::Statement supports everything
    supported by the XS version and, additionally, at least partial
    support for the following features that are not supported at all
    by the XS version:

    * Explicit and implicit joins
    * Table name aliases
    * Set functions
    * String functions
    * String concatenation
    * Numeric expressions
    * IN predicate
    * BETWEEN predicate
    * Alphabetic comparison in WHERE clauses
    * Ordering of text that looks like a number
    * Verbose error messages for both Parsing and Execution errors
