DESCRIPTION
    POE::Component::IRC::Plugin::QueryDNS is a POE::Component::IRC plugin
    that provides DNSBL query facilities to the channels it occupies and via
    private messaging.

    It uses POE::Component::Client::DNSBL to do non-blocking DNSBL queries.
    By default the plugin attempts to use POE::Component::IRC's internal
    PoCo-Client-DNS resolver object, but will spawn its own copy. You can
    supply your own resolver object via the constructor.

CONSTRUCTOR
    "new"
        Creates a new plugin object. Takes some optional parameter:

          'command', define the command that will trigger DNSBL queries, default is 'dnsbl';
          'privmsg', set to a true value to specify that the bot should reply with PRIVMSG instead of
                     NOTICE to privmsgs that it receives.
          'resolver', specify a POE::Component::Client::DNS object that the plugin should use,
                      the default is to try and use POE::Component::IRC's resolver;
          'dnsbl', the DNSBL zone to send queries to, default zen.spamhaus.org;

IRC USAGE
    The bot replies to requests in the following form, when addressed:

      dnsbl <ipv4_address>

    Of course, if you changed the "command" in the constructor it will be
    something different to "dns".
