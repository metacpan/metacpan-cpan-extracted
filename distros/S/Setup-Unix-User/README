NAME
    Setup::Unix::User - Setup Unix user (existence, home dir, group
    memberships)

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.14 of Setup::Unix::User (from Perl
    distribution Setup-Unix-User), released on 2017-07-10.

FUNCTIONS
  add_delete_user_groups
    Usage:

     add_delete_user_groups(%args) -> [status, msg, result, meta]

    Add/delete user from group memberships.

    This function is not exported.

    This function is idempotent (repeated invocations with same arguments
    has the same effect as single invocation). This function supports
    transactions.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   add_to* => *array[str]*

    *   delete_from* => *array[str]*

    *   etc_dir => *str* (default: "/etc")

FAQ
  How to create user without creating a group with the same name as that user?
    By default, "group" is set to the same name as the user. This will
    create group with the same name as the user (if the group didn't exist).
    You can set "group" to an existing group, e.g. "users" and the setup
    function will not create a new group with the same name as user. But
    note that the group must already exist (if it does not, you can create
    it first using Setup::Unix::Group).
