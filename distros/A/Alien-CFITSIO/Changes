    * No changes, promote to stable.

v4.6.2.3  2025-04-23 11:49:29-04:00 America/New_York (TRIAL RELEASE)

  [BUILD]

    * revert experiment to avoid hard dependency on Alien::curl.  making it a
      recommendation isn't good enough, as most installs most likely
      won't install recommendations.

v4.6.2.2  2025-04-22 22:29:56-04:00 America/New_York (TRIAL RELEASE)

  [BUILD]

    * update trial patch to rename preprocessor macro MACHINE to
      CFITSIO_MACHINE to avoid collision on *BSD-aarch64 on CPAN
      testers.

v4.6.2.1  2025-04-18 14:55:52-04:00 America/New_York (TRIAL RELEASE)

  [BUILD]

    * missing test dependency on Package::Stash

    * trial patch to use stdlib.h instead of malloc.h on FreeBSD & OpenBSD

v4.6.2.0  2025-04-15 21:49:29-04:00 America/New_York (TRIAL RELEASE)

  [ENHANCEMENT]

    * build CFITSIO v4.6.2


  [DIST/BUILD FIX]

    * revert back to Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Templates, as nothing
      seems to do what it does. See 
       * https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=148081
       * https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=164110



v4.5.0.0  2024-09-03 17:14:17-04:00 America/New_York (TRIAL RELEASE)

  [ENHANCEMENT]

    * build CFITSIO v4.5.0.

    * use Alien::curl to ensure that libcurl is available

  [DIST/BUILD FIX]

    * Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Templates was used when creating the
      distribution hardwire CFITSIO_VERSION into the module and
      alienfile, but one of its' dependencies
      (Dist::Zilla::Tester::DieHard) no longer passes its tests.
      CFITSIO_VERSION is now evaluated at compile time (boo).

v4.4.0.2  2024-03-11 10:09:00-04:00 America/New_York

  [BUILD FIX]

    * Alien::patch was not listed as a configure dependency

v4.4.0.1  2024-03-06 12:54:54-05:00 America/New_York

  [BUGFIX]

    * alienfile wasn't Perl 5.10 compliant, which is the minimum
      supported Perl version.

v4.4.0.0  2024-03-04 12:43:10-05:00 America/New_York

  [ENHANCEMENT]

    * build CFITSIO v4.4.0. Work around change CFITSIO's Makefile.in to
      allow setting DESTDIR in the environment

v4.3.1.0  2024-03-01 15:39:21-05:00 America/New_York

  [CHANGE IN DEFAULT INSTALLED VERSION]

    * The default version of CFITSIO installed has changed from "any
      version greater or equal to this distribution's version" to "the
      version which exactly matches this distribution's version" (ignoring
      the last stanza in the distriution's version)

      The previous behavior was based on the fact that CFITSIO's API
      is very backwards compatible, so pulling in a newer version
      wasn't harmful (except maybe if you're relying upon buggy
      behavior which is fixed in a newer version).

      However, upstream CFITSIO's build process may change for later
      versions, and this module will begin to fail to build through no
      fault of its own, breaking dependencies.

      Forcing an exact version of CFITSIO to be installed should
      alleviate this.


v4.3.0.0  2023-07-28 15:25:34-04:00 America/New_York

    * no functional changes. remove extraneous material from
      distribution.

v4.1.0.3  2022-06-22 17:46:46-04:00 America/New_York

  [BUILD]

    * environment variables ALIEN_CFITSIO_EXACT_VERSION and
      ALIEN_CFITSIO_ATLEAST_VERSION are available to force exact or
      minimum version of CFITSIO

    * extend exact_version and atleast_version functionality to share
      as well as system installations

    * only patch CFITSIO if a version specific patch is available
