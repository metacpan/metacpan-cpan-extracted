NAME

    Test2::Tools::PDL - Test2 tools for verifying Perl Data Language
    piddles

VERSION

    version 0.0003

SYNOPSIS

        use Test2::Tools::PDL;
    
        # Functions are exported by default.
        
        # Ensure something is a piddle.
        pdl_ok($x);
    
        # Compare two piddles.
        pdl_is($got, $expected, 'Same piddle.');

FUNCTIONS

 pdl_ok($thing, $name)

    Checks that the given $thing is a PDL object.

 pdl_is($got, $exp, $name);

    Checks that piddle $got is same as $exp.

    Now this method is internally similar as is($got->unpdl, $exp->unpdl).
    It's possible to work with both numeric PDLs as well as non-numeric
    PDLs (like PDL::Char, PDL::SV).

DESCRIPTION

    This module contains tools for verifying PDL piddles.

VARIABLES

    This module can be configured by some module variables.

 TOLERANCE, TOLERANCE_REL

    These two variables are used when comparing float piddles. For
    pdl_is($got, $exp, ...), the effective tolerance is $TOLERANCE +
    $TOLERANCE_REL * $exp.

    Default value of $TOLERANCE is same as
    $Test2::Compare::Float::DEFAULT_TOLERANCE, which is 1e-8. Default value
    of $TOLERANCE_REL is 0.

    For example, to use only relative tolerance,

        {
            local $Test2::Tools::PDL::TOLERANCE = 0;
            local $Test2::Tools::PDL::TOLERANCE_REL = 1e-6;
            ...
        }
