.Op Fl x
.Op Fl v
.Op Fl t
.Op Fl d

.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm dbmsd
runs on a server machine to service
.Tn DB
requests from client machines. Mainly a perl library
.Pp
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl v
Just print the version number, and exit.
.It Fl X
Run in debug mode, does not fork, does not detatch.
.It Fl t
Simple command tracing; to stdout
.It Fl d directory
Specifies the prefix for the directory to create the *.db files in. When compiled
with HASHING set; the
.Nm dbmsd
will in fact create another level of directories below this.
.It Fl p Arg port
Specifies the port number.
.It Fl b addresss
Specifies the address to bind the server to. If none is specified the server will listen on
all addresses (INADDR_ANY).
.It Fl c configfile
Use spefified config file (use the -v flag to see default config file). Or use '-' for stdin.
.It Fl C configfile
Check the specified config file and exit immediately with ok/not-ok. See also 
,Xref 8 dbmscheckconf
.It Fl u userid or username.
Specifies as which user the dbm(s) will be accesses. For sanity
and security reasons, the server
uses
.Xr setuid 2
to change to that userid (or username) as soon as the relevant
ports are opened, the loggin is startend and, for forking servers,
the dbmsd.pid file is writen. If not specified the default
.Dq nobdoy
is used.
.It Fl U
Specifies no user ID change; the server will run from the user ID
is was started from (usually root). This counters the
.Dq -u
flag above.
.El
.Pp
For example, 
.Dq Li "dbmsd -p 1234 -d /tmp"
Caused the server to listen to port 1234 (the default) and create
its Berkely DB files in /tmp (the default).
.Pp
The
.Nm dbmsd
utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.
