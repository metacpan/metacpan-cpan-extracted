NAME
    Plack::Middleware::File::Less - compile LESS templates into CSS
    stylesheets

SYNOPSIS
      use Plack::App::File;
      use Plack::Builder;

      builder {
          mount "/stylesheets" => builder {
              enable "File::Less";
              Plack::App::File->new(root => "./stylesheets");
          };
      };

      # Or with Middleware::Static
      enable "File::Less";
      enable "Static", path => qr/\.css$/, root => "./static";

DESCRIPTION
    Plack::Middleware::File::Less is middleware that compiles Less
    <http://lesscss.org> templates into CSS stylesheet..

    When a request comes in for *.css* file, this middleware changes the
    internal path to *.less* in the same directory. If the LESS template is
    found, a new CSS stylesheet is built on memory and served to the
    browsers. Otherwise, it falls back to the original *.css* file in the
    directory.

LESS BACKENDS
    If you have the "lessc" executable available in your PATH, this module
    automatically uses the command to convert LESS into CSS. If the command
    is not available and you have CSS::LESSp perl module available, it will
    be used. Otherwise you'll get an exception during the initialization of
    this middleware component.
