1.01 2009-12-18
  * Tidied code.
  * Add support for query strings to the formatter. 
  * Fix Catalyst version dependency; we mistakenly required 5.8004 instead
    of the correct 5.80004.

1.00 2009-08-14
  * The interaction between the plugin and the formatter has changed,
    necessitating a change in the configuration format. Check the docs for

    time_zone options before v1.00.
  * A test suite has been added.

  * Bug fix: literal \v in a regex isn't recognized properly. Change it
    to \x0b.
  * Use the stats object to get the time at the beginning of the request
    instead of the time the log is printed.
  * Enable stats for the application all the time, unless the user gives
    enable_stats => 0.
