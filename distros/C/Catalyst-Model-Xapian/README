DESCRIPTION
    This model class wraps Search::Xapian to provide a friendly, paged
    interface to Xapian (www.xapian.org) indexes. This class adds a little
    extra convenience on top of the Search::Xapian class. It expects you to
    use the QueryParser, and sets up some keywords based on the standard
    omega keywords (id, host, date, month, year,title), so that you can do
    searches like

      'fubar site:microsoft.com'
