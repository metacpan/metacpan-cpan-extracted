DESCRIPTION
    Logging lines to a file is a fairly useful and traditional way of
    recording what's going on in your application.

    However, if you have another use for the same sort of data (for example,
    sending to another process via a message queue, or storing in KiokuDB),
    then you can be needlessly repeating your data marshalling.

    Log::Message::Structured is a VERY VERY SIMPLE set of roles to help you
    make small structured classes which represent '"something which
    happened"', that you can then either pass around in your application,
    log in a traditional manor as a log line, or serialize to JSON or YAML
    for transmission over the network.

COMPONENTS
    The consuming class can include components, that will provide additional
    attributes. Here is a list of the components included in the basic
    distribution. More third party components may be available on CPAN.

    *   Log::Message::Structured::Component::Date

    *   Log::Message::Structured::Component::Hostname

    *   Log::Message::Structured::Component::AttributesFilter

ATTRIBUTES
    Except for "class", the basic Log::Message::Structured role provides no
    attributes. See available components in
    Log::Message::Structured::Component::* and consume them, or create
    attributes yourself, to enrich your class

  class
    Str,ro

    An attribute that returns the name of the class that were used when
    creating the instance.

METHODS
    The only non-accessor methods provided are those composed from
    MooseX::Storage related to serialization and deserialization.

  as_string
    Returns the event as a string. By default, returns an empty string.
    However as the class composes stringifier roles, as_string will return
    the proper string representation of the event instance.

  as_hash
    Returns the event as a hash. By default, returns a HashRef with all
    attributes, and their values. However, as the class composes modifier
    roles, the hash (and thus the string representation) will be changed
    accordingly

  BUILD
    An empty build method (which will be silently discarded if you have one
    in your class) is provided, so that additional components can wrap it
    (to farce lazy attributes to be built).

REQUIRED METHODS
    None.

OVERLOADING
    Log::Message::Structured overloads the stringify operator, and return
    the result of the "as_string" method.

A note about namespace::autoclean
    namespace::autoclean does not work correctly with roles that supply
    overloading. Therefore you should instead use:

        use namespace::clean -except => 'meta';

    instead in all classes using Log::Message::Structured.
