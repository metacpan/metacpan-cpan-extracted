NAME
    Sub::Talisman - use attributes to tag or classify subs

SYNOPSIS
            package Local::Example;
        
            use Sub::Talisman qw( Awesome Info );
        
            sub mysub :Awesome {
                    ...;
            }
        
            sub othersub :Info("Hello World") {
                    ...;
            }
        
            my @awesome_subs = Sub::Talisman->get_subs("Local::Example::Awesome");
        
            print Sub::Talisman    # prints "Hello World"
                    -> get_attribute_parameters(\&othersub, "Local::Example::Info")
                    -> [0];

DESCRIPTION
    Sub::Talisman allows you to define "talisman" attibutes for your subs, and
    provides a basic introspection API for these talismans.

  Class Methods
    Sub::Talisman's methods are designed to be called as class methods.

    `setup_for $package, \%options`
        This is used by `import` to setup a single attribute. As an example,
        to create a "Purpose" talisman in UNIVERSAL, then:

                Sub::Talisman->setup_for(
                        'UNIVERSAL',
                        { attribute => 'Purpose' },
                );

        The only option understood is "attribute" which provides the name of
        the attribute.

    `get_attributes($sub)`
        Gets a list of attributes associated with the sub. Each attribute is a
        package-qualified name, such as "Local::Example::Awesome" from the
        SYNPOSIS.

        $sub can be a code ref or a sub name. In the case of subs which have
        been exported and imported between packages, using the sub name may
        not be very reliable. Using a code reference is recommended.

        This function only returns attributes defined via Sub::Talisman. For
        other attributes such as the Perl built-in `:lvalue` attribute, see
        the `get` function in the attributes package.

    `get_attribute_parameters($sub, $attr)`
        Given a sub and an attribute name, retrieves the parenthesized list of
        parameters. For example:

                sub foo :Info("Hello World") { ... }
                my $params = Sub::Talisman->get_attribute_parameters(\&foo, "Info");

        The attribute name can be package-qualified. If it is not, then the
        caller package is assumed.

        The list of parameters retrieved is a simple arrayref (or undef if the
        attribute was used without parentheses). For a more structured
        approach including compile-time validation of the parameters, see
        Sub::Talisman::Struct.

    `get_subs($attr)`
        Finds all subs which have the attribute, and returns a list of their
        names. Anonymous subs are not returned.

CAVEATS
  Anonymous subs
    Talisman attributes may be added to anonymous subs too, but it is
    suspected that this may not be thread-safe...

            my $sub = sub :Awesome { ... };

    Anonymous subs can of course be assigned into the symbol tables, a la:

            *foo = sub :Awesome { ... };

    But as far as Sub::Talisman is concerned, they were anonymous at the time
    of definition, so remain anonymous. A workaround would be:

            no warnings 'redefine';
            sub foo :Awesome;
            *foo = sub :Awesome { ... };

  Talisman naming
    Perl reserves lower-case attributes for its own future use; lower-cased
    talisman attributes may work, but will probably spew warnings. Try to name
    your talisman attributes in UpperCamelCase.

  Talisman subs
    Be aware that creating an attribute Foo will also create a sub called
    "Foo" in your package. Sub::Talisman uses namespace::clean to later wipe
    that sub away, but that temporary sub does need to exist during
    compile-time, so you won't be able to use that name for your own subs.
