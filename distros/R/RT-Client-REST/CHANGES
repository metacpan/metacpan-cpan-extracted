  - Added the 'disabled' attribute to RT::Client::REST::Group and
    RT::Client::REST::Queue to match the addition in RT 4.2.2 --
    commit 7557633. Thanks Tom.
  - Allow a trailing forward slash in the server URI --
    RT#97621. Thanks Marco Pessotto.
  - Tests in 82-stringify.t are skipped with LWP::UserAgent 6.04
    which has buggy read timeout -- commit da577af. Thanks Marco
    Pessotto.
  - Fixed warning `Unescaped left brace in regex is deprecated'
    in perl 5.22 -- RT#106795. Thanks Mike Andrews.
  - Fixed documentation for RT::Client:REST::search() in POD --
    RT#98160.

0.49 Sat May 10 2014 "Dmitri Tikhonov" <dtikhonov@yahoo.com>
  - This module is now all covered by the Perl Artistic License:
    GPL is gone.  This was done with permission from the original
    author of the command-line `rt' utility, Abhijit Menon-Sen.
  - Support custom fields that contain '#' in their name.  Patch
    contributed by Ryan Niebur in RT#83856 -- thanks!
  - Documented get_links() -- RT#68673.
  - All tests now correctly run on Windows -- RT#81872.
  - All tests now correctly run on OpenBSD -- RT#95223.

0.48    Wed Apr 30 2014 "Dmitri Tikhonov" <dtikhonov@yahoo.com>
  - Fixed POD bug in 0.47 -- `logger' attribute and method of
    RT::Client::REST was not documented and this caused POD
    coverage test to fail.  While at it, made it a developer-only
    test.  This way, these types of issues do not cause all
    cpantesters to fail.

0.47    Wed Apr 30 2014 "Dmitri Tikhonov" <dtikhonov@yahoo.com>
  - Support redirects on login, RT#92371.
  - Skip failing test 83-attachments.t on OpenBSD while we investigage
    why it fails.  Track this issue in RT#95223.

0.46    Sat Apr 26 2014 "Dmitri Tikhonov" <dtikhonov@yahoo.com>
  This release only fixes several tests, there are no functional changes.

   - Added test 82-stringify.t (fails with 0.44 before the RT#88919 fix)
   - Added test 83-attachments.t to illustrate and check RT#90112

0.44
  Damien Krotkine
   - Add URI in the prereqs
  Dave Lambley

      considered experimental.
    - Refactor login method to accept any type of field name (not just username
      and password)

0.42
  False release. See 0.43
  - support for groups via new class RT::Client::REST::Group
  - Fix for ticket merges
  - Accept question mark in custom field names

0.41
  Tomas Doran <bobtfish@bobtfish.net>
 - Make version number a string to avoid length of version number changing
   at 0.X0 releases (as this breaks distro packages)
 - Update META.yml to the 0.4 META spec.
 - Include repository metadata to make it easier for people to contribute
   to the module.
 - Change from ExtUtils::MakeMaker to Module::Install (I'm sure you can
   generate the correct information with EU::MM, I just don't know how
   offhand).
 - Add Test::More as a test_requires to help distros which split it out
   of their core perl package (RT#45150)

0.40
  Jerrad Pierce <jpierce@cpan.org>
  - #38710, more user attributes
  - #39868 & #42391, Alter CF parsing to accomodate 3.8 as well as 3.6
    This required tweaks to Forms as well as Object.
  - #38591 & #43844, Add requestor attribute to Ticket so that autoreplies
    are sent to users under RT3.8

0.37 Fri Aug 15 2008 "Dmitri Tikhonov" <dtikhonov@yahoo.com>
  - Fri Aug 15 2008 "Dmitri Tikhonov" <dtikhonov@yahoo.com>
    Improvement: reorganized exceptions, made
    RT::Client::REST::Object::Exception a subclass of
    RT::Client::REST::Exception.  What this means is that now any native
    exception thrown by RT::Client::REST code can be caught by catching a
    generic RT::Client::REST::Exception class.  Added tests to ticket and
    attachment tests scripts to verify the behavior.  I have been meaning
    to do this for a while now.

    Fixed an error in RT::Client::REST::Ticket POD.  Bug 36814.

0.36    Sat May 10 2008 "Damien Krotkine" <dams@cpan.org>

  - Tue, 29 Jan 2008 "Damien Krotkine" <dams@cpan.org>
    Decode data from REST from the proper encoding to Perl internal.
    Thanks to "Sébastien Aperghis-Tramoni" <sebastien@aperghis.net>

  - Fri, 25 Jan 2008 "Damien Krotkine" <dams@cpan.org>
    Add dirty custom fields handling. Without it, cf are always submitted,
    included void ones, which may (and does on rt.cpan.org) conflict with
    custom fields rules on the server (e.g. a custom field value cannot be
    empty)

0.32    Sun Dec 23 2007 "Dmitri Tikhonov" <dtikhonov@yahoo.com>
  - Fixed bug 31827 -- allow to specify custom fields at creation time.
    Method 'cf' can now take a hash reference that has a list of custom
    fields and their values.

  - Fixed bug 31828: allow to specify ticket content at creation time.
    Methods RT::Client::REST->create and RT::Client::REST::Ticket->store
    now take optional 'text' parameter.
