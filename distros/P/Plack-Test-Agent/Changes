* Allow extra args to pass through in get() method. (Ran Eilam)

* Fixed a circular reference between the agent object and the Test::TCP it
  creates internally. (Dave Rolsky)

* Use Plack::Loader::load() rather than Plack::Loader::auto() if server arg has
  been provided. Previously, the constructor did start a new server when the
  server arg was defined, but it ignored the value of the server argument.
  (Olaf Alders)

* Document get_mech(), normalize_uri() and start_server() (Olaf Alders)
