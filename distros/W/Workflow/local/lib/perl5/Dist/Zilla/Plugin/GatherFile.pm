#pod
#pod =head1 DESCRIPTION
#pod
#pod This is a very, very simple L<FileGatherer|Dist::Zilla::Role::FileGatherer>
#pod plugin.  It adds all the files referenced by the C<filename> option that are
#pod found in the directory named in the L</root> attribute.  If the root begins
#pod with a tilde, the tilde is replaced with the current user's home directory
#pod according to L<File::HomeDir>.
#pod
#pod Since normally every distribution will use a GatherDir plugin, you would only
#pod need to use the GatherFile plugin if the file was already being excluded (e.g.
#pod from an C<exclude_match> configuration).

#pod =attr root

#pod the dist root -- generally, the place where your F<dist.ini> or other
#pod configuration file is located.

=head1 NAME

Dist::Zilla::Plugin::GatherFile - gather individual file(s)

=head1 VERSION

version 6.010

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  [GatherFile]
  filename = examples/file.txt

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a very, very simple L<FileGatherer|Dist::Zilla::Role::FileGatherer>
plugin.  It adds all the files referenced by the C<filename> option that are
found in the directory named in the L</root> attribute.  If the root begins
with a tilde, the tilde is replaced with the current user's home directory
according to L<File::HomeDir>.

Since normally every distribution will use a GatherDir plugin, you would only
need to use the GatherFile plugin if the file was already being excluded (e.g.
from an C<exclude_match> configuration).

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 root

This is the directory in which to look for files.  If not given, it defaults to
the dist root -- generally, the place where your F<dist.ini> or other
configuration file is located.

=head2 prefix

This parameter can be set to place the gathered files under a particular
directory.  See the L<description|DESCRIPTION> above for an example.

=head2 filename
