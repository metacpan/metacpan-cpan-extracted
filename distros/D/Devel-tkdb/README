NAME
       tkdb perl Debugger

DESCRIPTION

    This is tkdb, a debugger for perl that uses the Tcl/Tk for user
    interface. It features pushbutton controls for run, step-in, step-out,
    return, controls for breakpoints, expression evaluation and package
    browsing.

    Highly efficient.

    Have such a file:
      use strict;
      $a = 'qwerty';
      $a++;
      print $a;
      $a++;
      print $a;
      $a++;
      print $a;
      $a++;
      (.... following 150_000 (!) such lines of code)

    Loads and debugs within 4 sec - i.e. breakpoints, expressions in such
    a huge file - runs just like usual file. 10_000 line files start
    instantly.


Installation:

    use the MakeMaker interface:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make install

    If worse comes to worse you can simply copy the tkdb.pm file into 
    cp tkdb.pm /usr/local/lib/perl5/5.xxx/Devel/tkdb.pm

    On Windows:

    copy tkdb.pm C:\perl\5.x\lib\Devel\tkdb.pm

    To Test:

    perl -d:tkdb -e 1

Prerequisites:
   you must have Tcl::Tk module installed, which in turn requires Tcl
   module, which in turn requires Tcl/Tk. no more dependencies, follow
   instructions from those modules and you're done.
