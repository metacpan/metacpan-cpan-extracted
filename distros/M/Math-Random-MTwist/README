Math-Random-MTwist
==================

PREREQUISITES

Perl >= 5.10.0
Test::More

Why Perl 5.10? mtwist needs a fairly "modern" compiler (see mtwist.h). Now
what's the oldest Perl shipped together with a sufficiently recent compiler?
When it comes to "old", Debian is the first choice. The oldest Debian capable
of compiling mtwist is Lenny. Lenny ships Perl 5.10.0.
