NAME

    YAML::Dump - Dump stuff, (simplified) YAML style

VERSION

    This document describes YAML::Dump version 1.84.

SYNOPSIS

       use YAML::Dump qw< Dump >;
    
       my $data = { ... };
       say Dump $data

DESCRIPTION

    This module allows you to generate a YAML representation of a data
    structure, provided that:

      * there are no circular references

      * there are no objects or "weird" references, but see below

    If you recognize most (not all) the constraints of YAML::Tiny you are
    totally right, because most of the code in this module is taken from
    there. There are two notable differences:

      * booleans are supported, see "Booleans"

      * you can provide your way of dumping objects by implementing
      "dumper_for_unknown", see "Unsupported References".

 Booleans

    Booleans are recognized and rendered as either false and true
    (unquoted), depending on their truthness. The following variants are
    recognized:

      * a reference to a purely integer scalar variable holding values 0 or
      1. Dual-lived variables or other values will not work.

      * JSON::PP::Boolean

      * boolean

      * JSON::XS::Boolean

      * Types::Serialiaser::Boolean (although it should not be needed)

      * Mojo::JSON::_Bool, for Mojolicious up to version 6.21 (it later
      switched to JSON::PP::Boolean).

 Unsupported References

    When a reference that is neither a hash nor an array reference is
    found, method "dumper_for_objects" is called. This method first tries
    to figure out if the reference is one of the allowed "Booleans"
    representations, then hands over to a method "dumper_for_unknown" (if
    the class has one), then as a last resort it complains loudly dieing.

    If you want to provide your own dumping functions, you can either
    override "dumper_for_objects" (losing support for "Booleans"), or
    provide your method "dumper_for_unknown". By default there is none, so
    you can either derive a subclass from YAML::Dump, or monkey-patch it by
    implementing the method directly:

       sub YAML::Dump::dumper_for_unknown { 
          my ($self, $element, $line, $indent, $seen) = @_;
       }

FUNCTIONS

 Dump

       my $string = Dump(@data_structures);

    generate a YAML representation of @data_structures.

 INDENT

       my $string = INDENT;

    the indentation as space characters. This is useful if you have to
    generate indentation string with "dumper_for_unknown".

METHODS

 dumper_for_objects

       my @lines = $obj->dumper_for_objects($element, $line, $indent, $seen);

    This method generates a representation for booleans or, as a fallback,
    calls "dumper_for_unknown". If you override this you lose the
    possibility of dumping booleans, you are probably looking for
    "dumper_for_unknown".

 dumper_for_unknown

       my @stuff = $obj->dumper_for_unknown($element, $line, $indent, $seen);

    This method is not really present, but is invoked if you provide one
    (either in a subclass, or monkey-patching YAML::Dump, see "Unsupported
    References"). This allows you to provide your own generating functions
    for your classes, should you need to do this.

    The method is provided the following positional parameters:

    $element

      the element to dump in YAML

    $line

      the line where the element will be put (starting). It can be one of
      the following:

	* an empty string, in case the object is at the root level

	* a string starting with spaces and ending with a dash -: your
	element is part of an array

	* a string ending with a colon :: your element is the value of a
	hash

      If your dump is just on a single line, it's sufficient to pre-pend
      the string representation with a space; otherwise, decide what you
      want to do also taking into consideration $indent (see below) and
      also taking into consideration that it is your responsibility to
      output the $line anyway.

    $indent

      The indentation level, should you need it (e.g. for multi-line
      dumps). To generate the indentation string, use "INDENT":

         my $indentation_string = INDENT x $indent;

    $seen

      used to track circular references. Use this if your object contains
      other references with the potential for a cycle of references. This
      is how you can use it:

         sub dumper_for_unknown {
            # ...
      
            my $id = Scalar::Util::refaddr($some_reference);
            die \'circular references are unsupported' if $seen->{$id};
      
            # ...
         }

    The return value from this method can be either a list of lines (with
    the proper indentation, and starting with the content of $line above)
    or a single array or hash reference, which will be transformed
    automatically. This allows you to basically ignore $line, $indent (but
    probably not $seen) and let YAML::Dump do the work for you.

 new

       my $obj = YAML::Dump->new(@data_for_dumping);

    Generate an object. You should not need to use this, use "Dump"
    instead.

COPYRIGHT AND LICENSE

    This is tricky. A good part of the code comes from YAML::Tiny, whose
    copyright statement at time of copy is:

    Now, under the same terms as Perl itself is in itself a bit ambiguous,
    even though the original LICENSE has this:

          Software Foundation; either version 1, or (at your option) any

    Again, it's my understanding that even the same terms as Perl 5
    programming language system itself is a bit ambiguous. Also, the
    Artistic License is, in itself, ambiguous, which is why the Perl
    Foundation eventually recommended the Artistic License 2.0.

    Anyway, a hopefully compatible license can be found in file LICENSE.
