Text::Templet
=============

Text::Templet implements a very small, efficient and fast template 
processor that allows you to embed Perl variables and snippets of Perl 
code directly into HTML, XML or any other text. The module contains only
about 50 lines of actual code. Text::Templet uses Perl syntax for all
its functionality, which means you don't need to learn an entire new
platform to use it.
