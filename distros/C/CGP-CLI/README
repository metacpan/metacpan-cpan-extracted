The CLI.pm Perl module is the main component for CommuniGate Pro scripting.
It contains the package CGP::CLI and includes the routines to connect to
the CommuniGate Pro server over the network, to send CommuniGate Pro CLI
commands and to convert command parameters from the Perl internal format into
the CommuniGate Pro CLI format, and to convert command results back into the
Perl internal format.

You should use the new CGP::CLI command to establish an authenticated
connection with the CommuniGate Pro server and to create an interface
object. Then you send commands to the server by calling various interface
object methods.
