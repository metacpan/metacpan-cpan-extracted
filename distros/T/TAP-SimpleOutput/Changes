Revision history for TAP-SimpleOutput

0.009     2017-02-14 09:21:19 CST-0600
	* Explicitly require Perl::Version: not doing so was causing explosions in
	  test suites that use the new subtest header bits.

0.008     2016-11-15 17:59:39 CST-0600
	* counters() now returns a hashref when called in scalar context.
	* counters() is exported by default.

0.007     2016-11-08 19:54:55 CST-0600
	* No changes from 0.006-TRIAL.

0.006-TRIAL  2016-11-01 23:38:10 CDT-0500
	* Found and fixed a weird bug on Perls < 5.20

0.005-TRIAL  2016-11-01 17:05:59 CDT-0500
	* Add a couple utility functions to help with subtest tap generation.  The
	  location of these may change before the next non-trial/dev release.

0.004     2016-11-01 14:47:14 CDT-0500
	* Add tests for the "freeform" coderef
	* Add a counters_as_hashref(), to return a hashref of our counters

0.003     2015-05-05 21:58:29 PDT-0700
	* add changes_and_levelset()

0.002     2013-11-10 23:07:07 PST-0800
	* add $_add closure; $_todo is undocumented (?) so this one is for now as
	  well... but we need it for Test::Moose::More's tests and the recent
	  changes to Test::More.

0.001     2012-10-02 20:28:49 PST8PDT
	* initial release
