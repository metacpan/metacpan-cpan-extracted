NAME
    WebService::Mirth - Interact with a Mirth Connect server via REST

VERSION
    version 0.131220

SYNOPSIS
        my $mirth = WebService::Mirth->new(
            server   => 'mirth.example.com',
            port     => 8443,
            username => 'admin',
            password => 'password',
        );

        $mirth->export_channels({
            to_dir => 'path/to/export/to/'
        });

        $mirth->export_global_scripts({
            to_dir => 'path/to/export/to/'
        });

        $mirth->export_code_templates({
            to_dir => 'path/to/export/to/'
        });

DESCRIPTION
    Mirth Connect is an open-source Java-powered application used for
    healthcare integration. Incoming HL7 or XML feeds containing electronic
    medical records can be parsed and then handled (munged, stored, sent
    off, etc) by Mirth Connect.

    This module provides a pure-Perl means of RESTful interaction with a
    Mirth Connect server (referred to as "Mirth" going forward). The
    functionality is similar to what the "Mirth Shell" program provides
    within a Mirth installation.

    Parser code living in Mirth can be exported as XML files locally, for
    off-site archival.

    Mojo::DOM objects in some of the "ATTRIBUTES" could be used for
    inspecting or altering the channels locally (ie. turn a channel off by
    changing the "enabled" node from "true" to "false").

    The "login" and "logout" methods will automatically be called as needed.

    All internal HTTP interactions are performed via Mojo::UserAgent, so the
    "MOJO_USERAGENT_DEBUG" environment variable can be set to 1 to turn on
    HTTP debugging.

    Log::Minimal is used for application logging, so the "LM_DEBUG"
    environment variable can be set to 1 for additional debugging.

ATTRIBUTES
  server
    A string containing the FQDN (see "CAVEATS") of the Mirth server to
    connect to.

  port
    The Jetty port that Mirth is listening on for HTTP.

  version
    A string containing the version of Mirth that the "server" is hosting.
    This value is required by Mirth for HTTP interaction.

    Defaults to "0.0.0", which should be sufficient.

  username
    The name of the user to connect with. "admin" is likely a good choice:
    full administrative privileges are ideal.

  password
    The corresponding password for the "username" being used.

  base_url
    A Mojo::URL object that represents the HTTP address of the Mirth server.
    The RESTful HTTP requests will be made based on this URL.

    Mirth uses HTTPS, so it will be constructed into something like
    "https://mirth.example.com:8443".

  code_templates_dom
    A Mojo::DOM object of the XML representing the "Code Templates" in
    Mirth. Used by "get_code_templates" to create a
    WebService::Mirth::CodeTemplates object.

  global_scripts_dom
    A Mojo::DOM object of the XML representing the "Global Scripts" in
    Mirth. Used by "get_global_scripts" to create a
    WebService::Mirth::GlobalScripts object.

  channels_dom
    A Mojo::DOM object of the XML representing all of the channels in Mirth.
    Massaged by "get_channel" to return a WebService::Mirth::Channel object.

    Also used in the construction of "channel_list".

  channel_list
    Contains a hashref representing all of the channels in Mirth. The key is
    a channel name and the value is the corresponding channel ID.

METHODS
  login
        $mirth->login;

    Login as "username" at the "/users" URI, via an HTTP POST. If
    authentication is successful, starts a session that persists until
    "logout" is called.

    This method is automatically called upon object construction.

  get_global_scripts
        $global_scripts = $mirth->get_global_scripts;

    Returns a WebService::Mirth::GlobalScripts object of the "Global
    Scripts" in Mirth.

  export_global_scripts
        $mirth->export_global_scripts({
            to_dir => 'path/to/export/to/'
        });

    Given a path to a directory in the "to_dir" parameter, writes an XML
    file named "global_scripts.xml" to the directory.

  get_code_templates
        $code_templates = $mirth->get_code_templates;

    Returns a WebService::Mirth::CodeTemplates object of the "Code
    Templates" in Mirth.

  export_code_templates
        $mirth->export_code_templates({
            to_dir => 'path/to/export/to/'
        });

    Given a path to a directory in the "to_dir" parameter, writes an XML
    file named "code_templates.xml" to the directory.

  get_channel
        $channel = $mirth->get_channel('foobar');
        print $channel->name, "\n";    # "foobar"
        print $channel->id, "\n";      # "a25ea24c-d8f4-439a-9063-62f8a2b6a4b1"
        print $channel->enabled, "\n"; # "true"

    Given the name of a channel in Mirth, returns a
    WebService::Mirth::Channel object.

  export_channels
        $mirth->export_channels({
            to_dir => 'path/to/export/to/'
        });

    Given a path to a directory in the "to_dir" parameter, writes XML files
    (with names like "my_channel.xml") to the directory.

  logout
        $mirth->logout;

    Ends the session initiated by "login".

    This method is automatically called upon object destruction.

TODO
    Add feature to put channels onto a Mirth box

CAVEATS
  Server specification and session cookies
    It seems that an FQDN (fully-qualified domain name) is required for
    "server" in order for the session started by "login" (involving cookies)
    to stick.

    For example, an IP address for "server" is not sufficient. A workaround
    could be adding an entry to "/etc/hosts" with something like
    "mirth.localhost" (in which case, see hosts(1)).
