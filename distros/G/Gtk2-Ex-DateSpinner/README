Gtk2::Ex::DateSpinner is a simple date entry widget using spin buttons
for year, month and day.

It can be used as an ordinary widget in a dialog or form, and also as
a cell renderer with popup edit in a TreeView or similar.

The prerequisites are Gtk2-Perl, Date::Calc, and my Gtk2-Ex-WidgetBits
and Glib-Ex-ObjectBits.  The DateSpinner home page is
