NAME

    Net::Pcap - Interface to pcap(3) LBL packet capture library


DESCRIPTION

    The Net::Pcap module is a Perl binding to the LBL pcap(3) packet 
    capture library.

    The latest source code for the Pcap library can be found at 
    <http://www.tcpdump.org/>.  The source code and binary for the 
    Win32 port can be found at <http://www.winpcap.org/>.


INSTALLATION

    This module needs an ANSI-compliant compiler, the libpcap and
    its C headers to be installed on the target system.  On many
    operating systems, simply install the "libpcap" and "libpcap-dev"
    packages.

    If the library and C headers are not installed in a standard
    location, please provide the appropriate paths to Makefile.PL
    using the INC and/or LIBS options:

        $ perl Makefile.PL INC=-I/opt/pcap/include \
            LIBS='-L/opt/pcap/lib -lpcap'

    Then compile the extension as per usual:

        $ make all test
        $ make install

    To install the extension in a private directory, you can use the
    PREFIX option when creating Makefile.PL.

    For most of the tests, an administrative account is required 
    since opening a network interface in promiscuous mode is a 
    privileged operation.  Some tests also require a working network 
    interface with traffic on it otherwise the tests will appear to 
    hang.  You can generate traffic by pinging a non existing IP 
    address on your network segment.  Consult the source for individual 
    tests for more information.

    You can select the interface Net::Pcap will use for its tests by 
    creating a file device.txt in the distribution root directory and 
    putting the device name inside.

    Net::Pcap is compatible with all the versions of the Pcap library, 
    including the old BSD ones and the Windows port WinPcap.

    Net::Pcap should work on any Perl since 5.004_05. This module has 
    been tested by the author on the following Perl and system versions
    but is likely to run on many more:
