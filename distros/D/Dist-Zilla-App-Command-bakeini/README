Dist::Zilla::App::Command::bakeini

"bakeini" is an "App::Command" module for "Dist::Zilla" that enables one
to have two versions of their "dist.ini", one which contains their
bundle, and the other which is generated from the first in a static and
portable way, without requiring the bundle to be present.

This allows contributors and test targets to have a mostly "static"
configuration that is less prone to randomly breaking your distributions
every time you change something significant in your bundle.

It also allows contributors to only need the dependencies they really
need, not the super-set of dependencies your bundle probably implies.

And at the same time, you still have the flexibility and power you
normally have with a centralized configuration stored in a bundle, which
you can roll out on demand, instead of having the roll out automatically
propagate every time the bundle gets updated.
