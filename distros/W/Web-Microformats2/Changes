Revision history for Web::Microformats2

0.501 2019-06-06T16:26:33Z

    - Improved parsing of an edge case where the input document wants to
    place a new h-format under several u- or p- properties. (Probably
    erroneously, but we should still handle it gracefully.)

0.5 2018-07-30T13:50:48Z

    - Added support for parsing and presenting "rel" attributes.
    
    - Improved rendering of implied "value" data.
    
    - Improved rendering of implied "name" properties.
    
    - Added partial support for implied dates (regarding parsed datetime
    properties that specify a time but no date).
    
    - All 73 of the official Microformats2 tests pass now, so I removed
    all the TODO stuff from the test suite.

0.401 2018-07-23T11:59:13Z

    - Improved parsing and presentation of datetime properties.
    
    - Updated the tests to account for recent specification changes. (As
    a happy side effect, eleven formerly TODO-marked tests now run and
    pass.)

0.4 2018-05-18T13:10:37Z

    - Tests should now pass with older Perl versions. (GitHub issue #1;
    thanks to Slaven Rezić for the bug report.)
    
    - Adding Travis config.

0.3 2018-05-10T04:16:50Z

    - Miscellaneous minor documentation and testing improvements.

    - Improved working with UTF-8 documents.

    - Improved parsing of implied name properties.

    - Better handling of HTML documents that define multiple top-level
    Microformats2 items.

0.02 2018-04-20T19:59:48Z

    - Changing the public method used for returning a item's types.
    (New, flexible "all_types" method, removing blunt "types" from POD.)

0.01 2018-04-18T01:23:53Z

    - original version
