=head1 WINDOWS

This program is mainly designed and tested for GNU/Linux.
But it should work on dos/windows too.

Users who wan't to use this program and are not familiar with Perl, ar most likely going to try this on Windows.
This assumption is the reason for this little guide.
I hope it helps.

=head2 INSTALLATION

The program was tested using Strawberry Perl from L<http://strawberryperl.com/>.
You can simply install e.g. the portable distribution, launch the Perl Shell and then type:

 cpan School::Code::Compare

=head2 CREATE A LIST OF FILES

A simple way to create a file with the paths to other files:

 dir /s /b C:\your\javaprojects > paths.txt

=head2 RUN THE PROGRAM

When you have a file containing your paths, you can run the program:

 compare-code -i java -f paths.txt -o html -p

You should then find some html files in your current directory.
