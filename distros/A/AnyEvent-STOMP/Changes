Revision history for AnyEvent-STOMP:

0.7     Mon Jan 13 09:56:22 EST 2014
        - Ownership taken over by Fulko Hew.
        - Added a backwards compatible 'content-length' option.  It facilitates
          indirect control over ActiveMQ/JMS text/byte message control. See:
          'Working with JMS Text/Bytes Messages and Stomp' in
          http://activemq.apache.org/stomp.html
        - Since empty headers are now feasible, it now handles sending messages
          with no headers.
        - BUGFIX: The DESTROY() function was not being invoked when objects
          went out of scope because its handle->fh contained a reference
          to the original object (causing a circular reference).  A new
          mandatory destroy() method now exists to facilitate a proper
          cleanup avoiding the related memory leak.

0.6     Sat Apr 16 11:36:03 PDT 2011
        - BUGFIX: Only unregister connect callback in error handler 
          if one was specified.  (Thanks to Dexter Tad-y for the fix.)

0.5     Thu Nov 11 16:55:38 PST 2010
        - Added support for 'prepare' and 'connect' events (same as
          on_prepare and on_connect callbacks in AnyEvent::Handle).

0.4     Thu Nov 11 14:40:00 PST 2010
        - Fixed a memory leak in the I/O error callback.
        - Fixed auto-acknowledge mode (only acknowledge messages having a 
          'message-id' header).

0.3     Wed Nov 10 22:33:57 PST 2010
        - Set SO_KEEPALIVE on the server connection socket.

0.2     Sat Oct 30 12:14:31 PDT 2010
        - Fixed auto-acknowledge mode (in prior releases, server never needed
          acknowledgment regardless of the setting).
        - Added manual acknowledgment mode.

0.11    Sun Oct 24 18:18:37 PDT 2010
        - Skipped Pod::Coverage test.

0.1     Sat Oct 23 22:56:58 PDT 2010
