NAME
    GitDDL - database migration utility for git managed sql

SYNOPSIS
        my $gd = GitDDL->new(
            work_tree => '/path/to/project', # git working directory
            ddl_file  => 'sql/schema_ddl.sql',
            dsn       => ['dbi:mysql:my_project', 'root', ''],
        );
    
        # checking whether the database version matchs ddl_file version or not.
        $gd->check_version;
    
        # getting database version
        my $db_version = $gd->database_version;
    
        # getting ddl version
        my $ddl_version = $gd->ddl_version;
    
        # upgrade database
        $gd->upgrade_database;
    
        # deploy ddl
        $gd->deploy;

DESCRIPTION
    This is database migration helper module for users who manage database
    schema version by single .sql file in git repository.

    By using this module, you can deploy .sql to database, check sql version
    between database and .sql file, make diff between them, and apply alter
    table to database.

METHODS
  GitDDL->new(%options)
        my $gd = GitDDL->new(
            work_tree => '/path/to/project', # git working directory
            ddl_file  => 'sql/schema_ddl.sql',
            dsn       => ['dbi:mysql:my_project', 'root', ''],
        );

    Create GitDDL object. Available options are:

    *   work_tree => 'Str' (Required)

        Git working tree path includes target ddl file.

    *   ddl_file => 'Str' (Required)

        ddl file (.sql file) path in repository.

        If ddl file located at /repos/project/sql/schema.sql and work_tree
        root is /repos/project, then this option should be sql/schema.sql

    *   dsn => 'ArrayRef' (Required)

        DSN parameter that pass to DBI module.

    *   version_table => 'Str' (optional)

        database table name that contains its git commit version. (default:
        git_ddl_version)

    *   sql_filter => 'CodeRef' (optional)

        CodeRef for filtering sql content. It is invoked only in "diff()"
        method. (default: do nothing)

  check_version()
        $gd->check_version();

    Compare versions latest ddl sql and database, and return true when both
    version is same.

    Otherwise return false, which means database is not latest. To upgrade
    database to latest, see upgrade_database method described below.

  database_version()
    Return git commit hash indicates database's schema.

  ddl_version()
    Return git commit hash indicates ddl file.

  deploy()
    Just deploy ddl_file schema to database. This method is designed for
    initial database setup. But database should be created previously.

  diff()
    Show sql differences between ddl file and database. This method is
    useful for dry-run checking before upgrade_database.

  upgrade_database()
    Upgrade database schema to latest ddl schema.
