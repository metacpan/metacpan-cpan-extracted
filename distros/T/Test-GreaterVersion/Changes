Man, this is weird! Some tests (tests 4 in both test script
02-...t and 03-...t break if the user has turned on colourized
output in his CPAN shell. Basically this output is seen when
running 'make test':

ok 4 - name of non-existent module
# Getting version from installed module failed
ok 5 - name of module not in lib
FAILED test 4

That really is weird...

Thanks to Andreas König and Slaven Rezic for testing!

Updated documentation.
_get_installed_version() doesn't call CPAN::Shell::inst_version()
anymore (which I thought I had removed in 0.007 anyway).

Added Cwd as a prerequisite to Makefile.PL.
The description in the module list on CPAN, the abstract
in the Makefile.PL and the one-line description in the POD
are now the same.

Added CPAN::Version as a prerequisite to Makefile.PL
Now uses CPAN::Version::vgt() for version number comparison.

Version is now compared with the help of CPAN::Version.
Version information is now always looked up with the help
of CPAN or MakeMaker.
Added test for POD to raise my kwalitee-rating ;)

Added more documentation, README and this file. Module
should work on all OSs by the magic of Cwd and File::Spec.

Now compares against the CPAN version as well. Looked at
CPAN.pm and gone blind ;)
