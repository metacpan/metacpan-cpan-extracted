NAME
    CGI::Bus - CGI user interface for DBI applications

DESCRIPTION
    A web database with record versioning, access control at the record
    level, and file attachments was needed for me, see examples and
    CGI::Bus::tmsql... Modular structure and some codes implemented due to
    infrastructural needs. Architecture of this library sometimes may be
    bad. This is very young software and its development is dependent on
    conceptual changes or useful applications.
