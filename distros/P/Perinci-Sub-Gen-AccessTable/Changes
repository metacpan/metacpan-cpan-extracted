0.592   2023-02-24  Released-By: PERLANCAR; Urgency: medium

        - [deprecation] Rename table_spec argument to table_def (old name
          is still supported but deprecated and will be removed in the
          future).


0.591   2023-02-12  Released-By: PERLANCAR; Urgency: medium

        - Support TableData object as data source.


0.590   2022-11-02  Released-By: PERLANCAR; Urgency: medium

        - Enable regex searching.

        - [ux] Describe the generated --queries and --query-boolean option.


0.589   2022-11-02  Released-By: PERLANCAR; Urgency: medium

        - [bugfix] Forgot to generate 'query_boolean' argument.


0.588   2022-11-02  Released-By: PERLANCAR; Urgency: medium; Backward-Incompatible: yes

        - [incompatible change] Change generated 'query' (str) argument to
          'queries' (array of str) argument to allow for multiple queries
          as well as negative searching.


0.587   2021-07-29  Released-By: PERLANCAR; Urgency: medium

	- Update to Data::Sah::Resolve 0.010.


0.586   2020-10-28  Released-By: PERLANCAR; Urgency: medium

	- Add option: case_insensitive_comparison.


0.585   2020-10-07  Released-By: PERLANCAR; Urgency: medium

	- Also use Data::Sah::Resolve in filters. Data::Sah::Resolve has been
          used in determining what argument specification to produce for each
          table field. But when parsing query, Data::Sah::Resolve has not been
          used in interpreting the arguments properly, so table field with
          schema like "uint" (instead of just "int") do not get filtered even
          though the associated argument has been passed. This release fixes
          that.


0.584   2020-10-04  Released-By: PERLANCAR; Urgency: medium

	- Use Data::Sah::Resolve. This allows us to produce, e.g. --foo-min &
          --foo-max options for 'uint' fields instead of just 'int' fields.


0.583   2020-02-23  Released-By: PERLANCAR; Urgency: medium

	- [bugfix] Fix previous commit.


0.582   2020-01-03  Released-By: PERLANCAR; Urgency: medium

        [Incompatible changes]

        - Make the generated 'sort' argument as array of str instead of str, so
          we can add an 'in' schema clause to each str and helps tab completion
          complete each sort field.


0.54    2015-09-04  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- No functional changes.

	- [dist] Move spec prereqs from RuntimeRequires to

        - Add some *_aliases args to gen_read_table_func() to set
          cmdline_aliases for generated args like detail, with_field_names, etc.

        - [ux] Give default alias -l for --detail.

        - [Incompatible Change] Rename --q to --query but give -q as cmdline
          alias.

0.35     2014-04-02  Released-By: SHARYANTO

         [REMOVED FEATURES]

         - No longer add table description to function's description. Instead,
           generated help/documentation on table structure will be produced by
           Perinci::CmdLine's help hooks or corresponding Perinci::To::Doc's
           hook. See Perinci::Sub::Property::result::table.


0.34     2014-03-29  Released-By: SHARYANTO

         - Bugfix: 'table.fields' result metadata had an extra array level.

           'index' property in field specification is now renamed to 'pos' in
           the TableSpec spec, but this module will support both for some time.


0.31     2014-03-27  Released-By: SHARYANTO

           after 'use warnings'" [CT].


0.20     2013-08-07  Released-By: SHARYANTO

         [ENHANCEMENTS]

         - Add F.in and F.not_in filtering arguments for each field.

         [ETC]

         - Add 'use experimental smartmatch' for 5.18+.


0.19     2013-07-05  Released-By: SHARYANTO

         [BUG FIXES]

         - Do not produce circular references between 'FIELD' and 'FIELD.is'
           arguments. This prevents Riap clients from fetching the generated
           function's metadata.


0.18     2013-07-04  Released-By: SHARYANTO

         [ENHANCEMENTS]

         - Add hooks to allow generated function to execute other stuffs.


0.17     2012-11-02  Released-By: SHARYANTO

         - No functional changes. Slightly reduce startup overhead by not using
           Perinci::Exporter and delay loading modules.

         [INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES]

         - No longer uses Perinci::Exporter (I'm personally deprecating the use
           of that module).


0.16     2012-08-10  Released-By: SHARYANTO

         - No functional changes. To avoid circular dependency, split
           Perinci::Sub::Gen::common into its own dist and rename it to
           Perinci::Sub::Gen.


0.15     2012-08-04  Released-By: SHARYANTO

         [BUG FIXES]

         - Previous fix didn't work.


0.14     2012-08-03  Released-By: SHARYANTO

         [BUG FIXES]

         - Fix finding caller if function is wrapped (since we use
           Perinci::Exporter).


0.13     2012-07-11  Released-By: SHARYANTO

         [INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES]

         - Now argument 'name' is required.

         [ENHANCEMENTS]

         - Add arguments 'name', 'package', and 'install'. Now installs
           generated function for you by default.


0.12     2012-06-04  Released-By: SHARYANTO

         [ENHANCEMENTS]

         - Add arguments 'summary' and 'description' to pass to generated
           metadata.


0.11     2012-06-04  Released-By: SHARYANTO

         [INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES]

         - Make terminology consistent (column -> field, row -> record). This
           means table spec's 'columns' is now 'fields'. Subroutine table data
           is expected to return 'fields_selected' instead of
           'columns_selected'. Sorry for this.


0.10     2012-03-23  Released-By: SHARYANTO

         [FIXES]

         - Fix --detail

         [INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES]

         - --fields now does not automatically enables --with-field-names


0.09     2012-03-22  Released-By: SHARYANTO

         [ENHANCEMENTS]

         - Remove 'default_filters' which exposed internal filter structure,
           replace it with 'default_arg_values' instead.

         - Add 'custom_filters'.


0.08     2012-03-22  Released-By: SHARYANTO

         - Fixes for English translation.

         - build: Tweak dependency.


0.07     2012-03-22  Released-By: SHARYANTO

         - Rename distribution from Sub-Spec-Gen-ReadTable to
           Perinci-Sub-Gen-AccessTable.

         [INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES]

         - Syntax of filter arguments become "FIELD.min", "FIELD.max", etc
           instead of the old "min_FIELD", "max_FIELD", etc. This results in
           fewer clashes with other arguments.

         - Rename some arguments: show_field_names -> with_field_names.

         - Rename some filter arguments, for consistency: contain -> contains,
           not -> isnt, match -> matches, lack -> lacks.

         [ENHANCEMENTS]

         - Translation.

         - Add some filter arguments: xmin, xmax.


0.06     2012-01-20  Released-By: SHARYANTO

0.04     2011-10-19  Released-By: SHARYANTO

         [INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES, ENHANCEMENTS]

         - 'table_data' function is now expected to return {data=>DATA, ...}
           instead of just DATA. This is to allow function to return data that
           is already filtered (by passing filtered=>1), and/or sorted
           (sorted=>1), and/or paged (paged=>1) for efficiency.


0.03     2011-08-31  Released-By: SHARYANTO

         - No functional changes. Updated because _parse_schema() is moved from
           Sub::Spec::Utils to Data::Sah::Util.


0.02     2011-06-13  Released-By: SHARYANTO

         [ENHANCEMENTS]

         - Generated function can search array fields.

         - Column specification clause: column_searchable (default 1) which can
           be set to false to exclude column from searching.

         - Provide search data (search_fields, search_re) in query.


0.01     2011-06-13  Released-By: SHARYANTO

         - First release.
