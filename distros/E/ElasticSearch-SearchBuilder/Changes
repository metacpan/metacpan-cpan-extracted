Revision history for ElasticSearch::SearchBuilder

0.19    2013-12-14

0.18    2012-11-25
        BREAKING CHANGE:
        The and/or/not logic in queries was being merged incorrectly into
        single bool queries with top-level "must" and "should" clauses,
        which changed the logic slightly, eg:
        A && B && (C||D) was interpreted as A && BB && (C || D || 1)

        Changed to using Test::Deep to fix the test errors caused by the
        change in hash randomization in perl 5.17.6

0.17    2012-11-09
        Minor correction - _top_recurse on an empty clause should return
        undef, not an empty list, as it is called in scalar context

0.16    2012-10-31

        BREAKING CHANGE:
