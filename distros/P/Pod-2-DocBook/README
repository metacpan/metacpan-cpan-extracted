SYNOPSIS
        use Pod::2::DocBook;
        my $parser = Pod::2::DocBook->new(
            title             => 'My Article',
            doctype           => 'article',
            base_id           => 'article42'
            fix_double_quotes => 1,
            spaces            => 3,
            id_version        => 2,
        );

      $parser->parse_from_file ('my_article.pod', 'my_article.sgml');

DESCRIPTION
    Pod::2::DocBook is a module for translating Pod-formatted documents to
    DocBook 4.2 SGML (see <http://www.docbook.org/>). It is primarily a back
    end for pod2docbook, but, as a Pod::Parser subclass, it can be used on
    its own. The only public extensions to the Pod::Parser interface are
    options available to "new()":

    doctype
        This option sets the output document's doctype. The currently
        supported types are article, chapter, refentry and section. Special
        processing is performed when the doctype is set to refentry (see
        "Document Types"). You *must* set this option in order to get valid
        DocBook output.

    fix_double_quotes
        If this option is set to a true value, pairs of double quote
        characters ('"') in ordinary paragraphs will be replaced with
        <quote> and </quote>. See "Ordinary Paragraphs" for details.

    header
        If this option is set to a true value, Pod::2::DocBook will emit a
        DOCTYPE as the first line of output.

    spaces
        Pod::2::DocBook produces pretty-printed output. This option sets the
        number of spaces per level of indentation in the output.

    title
        This option sets the output document's title.

    The rest of this document only describes issues specific to
    Pod::2::DocBook; for details on invoking the parser, specifically the
    "new()", "parse_from_file()" and "parse_from_filehandle()" methods, see
    Pod::Parser.

METHODS
        use base 'Pod::Parser';

  initialize()
    Initialize parser.

  begin_pod()
    Output docbook header stuff.

  end_pod()
    Output docbook footer. Will print also errors if any in a comment block.

  commans($command, $paragraph, $line_num)
    Process POD commands.

  textblock ($paragraph, $line_num)
    Process text block.

  verbatim($paragraph, $line_num)
    Process verbatim text block.

  interior_sequence($command, $argument, $seq)
    Process formatting commands.

  error_msg
    Returns parser error message(s) if any occured.

  make_id($text)
    default id format -

    Function will construct an element id string. Id string is composed of
    "join (':', $parser->{base_id}, $text)", where $text in most cases is
    the pod heading text.

    version 2 id format -

    having ':' in id was not a best choice. (Xerces complains - Attribute
    value "lib.Moose.Manual.pod:NAME" of type ID must be an NCName when
    namespaces are enabled.) To not break backwards compatibity switch with
    <id_version = 2>> in constructor for using '-' instead.

    The xml id string has strict format. Checkout "cleanup_id" function for
    specification.

  make_uniq_id($text)
    Calls "$parser->make_id($text)" and checks if such id was already
    generated. If so, generates new one by adding _i1 (or _i2, i3, ...) to
    the id string. Return value is new uniq id string.

  cleanup_id($id_string)
    This function is used internally to remove/change any illegal characters
    from the elements id string. (see
    http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/REC-xml-20001006#NT-Name for the id string
    specification)

        $id_string =~ s/<!\[CDATA\[(.+?)\]\]>/$1/g;   # keep just inside of CDATA
        $id_string =~ s/<.+?>//g;                     # remove tags
        $id_string =~ s/^\s*//;                       # ltrim spaces
        $id_string =~ s/\s*$//;                       # rtrim spaces
        $id_string =~ tr{/ }{._};                     # replace / with . and spaces with _
        $id_string =~ s/[^\-_a-zA-Z0-9\.: ]//g;       # closed set of characters allowed in id string

    In the worst case when the $id_string after clean up will not conform
    with the specification, warning will be printed out and random number
    with leading colon will be used.

POD TO DOCBOOK TRANSLATION
    Pod is a deceptively simple format; it is easy to learn and very
    straightforward to use, but it is suprisingly expressive. Nevertheless,
    it is not nearly as expressive or complex as DocBook. In most cases,
    given some Pod, the analogous DocBook markup is obvious, but not always.
    This section describes how Pod::2::DocBook treats Pod input so that Pod
    authors may make informed choices. In every case, Pod::2::DocBook
    strives to make easy things easy and hard things possible.

    The primary motivation behind Pod::2::DocBook is to facilitate
    single-source publishing. That is, you should be able to generate man
    pages, web pages, PDF and PostScript documents, or any other format your
    SGML and/or Pod tools can produce, from the same Pod source, without the
    need for hand-editing any intermediate files. This may not always be
    possible, or you may simply choose to render Pod to DocBook and use that
    as your single source. To satisfy the first requirement, Pod::2::DocBook
    always processes the entire Pod source and tries very hard to produce
    valid DocBook markup, even in the presence of malformed Pod (see
    "DIAGNOSTICS"). To satisfy the second requirement (and to be a little
    nifty), Pod::2::DocBook pretty-prints its output. If you're curious
    about what specific output to expect, read on.

  Document Types
    DocBook's structure is very modular; many of its document types can be
    embedded directly into other documents. Accordingly, Pod::2::DocBook
    will generate four different document types: article, chapter, refentry,
    and section. This makes it easy, for instance, to write all the chapters
    of a book in separate Pod documents, translate them into DocBook markup
    and later glue them together before processing the entire book. You
    could do the same with each section in an article, or you could write
    the entire article in a single Pod document. Other document types, such
    as book and set, do not map easily from Pod, because they require
    structure for which there is no Pod equivalent. But given sections and
    chapters, making larger documents becomes much simpler.

    The refentry document type is a little different from the others.
    Sections, articles, and chapters are essentially composed of nested
    sections. But a refentry has specialized elements for the *NAME* and
    *SYNOPSIS* sections. To accommodate this, Pod::2::DocBook performs extra
    processing on the Pod source when the doctype is set to refentry. You
    probably don't have to do anything to your document to assist the
    processing; typical man page conventions cover the requirements. Just
    make sure that the *NAME* and *SYNOPSIS* headers are both =head1s, that
    "NAME" and "SYNOPSIS" are both uppercase, and that =head1 NAME is the
    first line of Pod source.

  Ordinary Paragraphs
    Ordinary paragraphs in a Pod document translate naturally to DocBook
    paragraphs. Specifically, after any formatting codes are processed, the
    characters "<", ">" and "&" are translated to their respective SGML
    character entities, and the paragraph is wrapped in <para> and </para>.

    For example, given this Pod paragraph:

      Here is some text with I<italics> & an ampersand.

    Pod::2::DocBook would produce DocBook markup similar to this:

      <para>
        Here is some text with <emphasis role="italic">italics</emphasis>
        &amp; an ampersand.
      </para>

    Depending on your final output format, you may sometimes want double
    quotes in ordinary paragraphs to show up ultimately as "smart quotes"
    (little 66s and 99s). Pod::2::DocBook offers a convenient mechanism for
    handling double quotes in ordinary paragraphs and letting your SGML
    toolchain manage their presentation: the fix_double_quotes option to
    "new()". If this option is set to a true value, Pod::2::DocBook will
    replace pairs of double quotes in ordinary paragraphs (and *only* in
    ordinary paragraphs) with <quote> and </quote>.

    For example, given this Pod paragraph:

      Here is some text with I<italics> & an "ampersand".

    Pod::2::DocBook, with fix_double_quotes set, would produce DocBook
    markup similar to this:

      <para>
        Here is some text with <emphasis role="italic">italics</emphasis>
        &amp; an <quote>ampersand</quote>.
      </para>

    If you have a paragraph with an odd number of double quotes, the last
    one will be left untouched, which may or may not be what you want. If
    you have such a document, replace the unpaired double quote character
    with E<quot>, and Pod::2::DocBook should be able to give you the output
    you expect. Also, if you have any =begin docbook ... =end docbook
    regions (see "Embedded DocBook Markup") in your Pod, you are responsible
    for managing your own quotes in those regions.

  Verbatim Paragraphs
    Verbatim paragraphs translate even more naturally; perlpodspec mandates
    that absolutely no processing should be performed on them. So
    Pod::2::DocBook simply marks them as CDATA and wraps them in <screen>
    and </screen>. They are not indented the way ordinary paragraphs are,
    because they treat whitespace as significant.

    For example, given this verbatim paragraph (imagine there's leading
    whitespace in the source):

      my $i = 10;
      while (<> && $i--) {
          print "$i: $_";
      }

    Pod::2::DocBook would produce DocBook markup similar to this:

      <screen><![CDATA[my $i = 10;
      while (<> && $i--) {
          print "$i: $_";
      }]] ></screen>

    Multiple contiguous verbatim paragraphs are treated as a single *screen*
    element, with blank lines separating the paragraphs, as dictated by
    perlpodspec.

  Command Paragraphs
    "=head1 Heading Text"
    "=head2 Heading Text"
    "=head3 Heading Text"
    "=head4 Heading Text"
        All of the Pod heading commands produce DocBook *section* elements,
        with the heading text as titles. Pod::2::DocBook (perlpod) only
        allows for 4 heading levels, but DocBook allows arbitrary nesting;
        see "Embedded DocBook Markup" if you need more than 4 levels.
        Pod::2::DocBook only looks at relative heading levels to determine
        nesting. For example, this bit of Pod:

          =head1 1

          Contents of section 1

          =head2 1.1

          Contents of section 1.1

        and this bit of Pod:

          =head1 1

          Contents of section 1

          =head3 1.1

          Contents of section 1.1

        both produce the same DocBook markup, which will look something like
        this:

          <section id="article-My-Article-1"><title>1</title>
            <para>
              Contents of section 1
            </para>
            <section id="article-My-Article-1-1"><title>1.1</title>
              <para>
                Contents of section 1.1
              </para>
            </section>
          </section>

        Note that Pod::2::DocBook automatically generates section
        identifiers from your doctype, document title and section title. It
        does the same when you make internal links (see "Formatting Codes",
        ensuring that if you supply the same link text as you did for the
        section title, the resulting identifiers will be the same.

    "=over indentlevel"
    "=item stuff..."
    "=back"
        "=over" ... "=back" regions are somewhat complex, in that they can
        lead to a variety of DocBook constructs. In every case,
        *indentlevel* is ignored by Pod::2::DocBook, since that's best left
        to your stylesheets.

        An "=over" ... "=back" region with no "=item"s represents indented
        text and maps directly to a DocBook *blockquote* element. Given this
        source:

          =over 4

          This text should be indented.

          =back

        Pod::2::DocBook will produce DocBook markup similar to this:

          <blockquote>
            <para>
              This text should be indented.
            </para>
          </blockquote>

        Inside an "=over" ... "=back" region, "=item" commands generate
        lists. The text that follows the first "=item" determines the type
        of list that will be output:

        *   "*" (an asterisk) produces <itemizedlist>

        *   "1" or "1." produces <orderedlist numeration="arabic">

        *   "a" or "a." produces <orderedlist numeration="loweralpha">

        *   "A" or "A." produces <orderedlist numeration="upperalpha">

        *   "i" or "i." produces <orderedlist numeration="lowerroman">

        *   "I" or "I." produces <orderedlist numeration="upperroman">

        *   anything else produces <variablelist>

        Since the output from each of these is relatively verbose, the best
        way to see examples is to actually render some Pod into DocBook.

    "=pod"
    "=cut"
        Pod::Parser recognizes these commands, and, therefore, so does
        Pod::2::DocBook, but they don't produce any output.

    "=begin formatname"
    "=end formatname"
    "=for formatname text..."
        Pod::2::DocBook supports two formats: docbook, explained in
        "Embedded DocBook Markup", and table, explained in "Simple Tables".

    "=encoding encodingname"
        This command is currently not supported. If Pod::2::DocBook
        encounters a document that contains "=encoding", it will ignore the
        command and report an error ("unknown command `%s' at line %d in
        file %s").

   Embedded DocBook Markup
    There are a wide range of DocBook structures for which there is no Pod
    equivalent. For these, you will have to provide your own markup using
    =begin docbook ... =end docbook or =for docbook .... Pod::2::DocBook
    will directly output whatever text you provide, unprocessed, so it's up
    to you to ensure that it's valid DocBook.

    Images, footnotes and many inline elements are obvious candidates for
    embedded markup. Another possible use is nesting sections more than
    four-deep. For example, given this source:

      =head1  1

      This is Section 1

      =head2 1.1

      This is Section 1.1

      =head3 1.1.1

      This is Section 1.1.1

      =head4 1.1.1.1

      This is Section 1.1.1.1

      =begin docbook

      <section>
      <title>1.1.1.1.1</title>
      <para>This is Section 1.1.1.1.1</para>
      </section>

      =end docbook

    Pod::2::DocBook will generate DocBook markup similar to this:

        <section id="article-My-Article-1"><title>1</title>
          <para>
            This is Section 1
          </para>
          <section id="article-My-Article-1-1"><title>1.1</title>
            <para>
          This is Section 1.1
            </para>
            <section id="article-My-Article-1-1-1"><title>1.1.1</title>
              <para>
            This is Section 1.1.1
              </para>
              <section id="article-My-Article-1-1-1-1"><title>1.1.1.1</title>
                <para>
              This is Section 1.1.1.1
                </para>
      <section>
      <title>1.1.1.1.1</title>
      <para>This is Section 1.1.1.1.1</para>
      </section>
              </section>
            </section>
          </section>
        </section>

   Simple Tables
    Pod::2::DocBook also provides a mechanism for generating basic tables
    with =begin table and =end docbook. If you have simple tabular data or a
    CSV file exported from some application, Pod::2::DocBook makes it easy
    to generate a table from your data. The syntax is intended to be simple,
    so DocBook's entire table feature set is not represented, but even if
    you do need more complex table markup than Pod::2::DocBook produces, you
    can rapidly produce some markup which you can hand-edit and then embed
    directly in your Pod with =begin docbook ... =end docbook. Each table
    definition spans multiple lines, so there is no equivalent =for table
    command.

    The first line of a table definition gives the table's title. The second
    line gives a list of comma-separated column specifications (really just
    column alignments), each of which can be left, center or right. The
    third line is a list of comma-separated column headings, and every
    subsequent line consists of comma-separated row data. If any of your
    data actually contain commas, you can enclose them in double quotes; if
    they also contain double quotes, you must escape the inner quotes with
    backslashes (typical CSV stuff).

    Here's an example:

      =begin table

      Sample Table
      left,center,right
      Powers of Ten,Planets,Dollars
      10,Earth,$1
      100,Mercury,$5
      1000,Mars,$10
      10000,Venus,$20
      100000,"Jupiter, Saturn",$50

      =end table

    And here's what Pod::2::DocBook would do with it:

      <table>
        <title>Sample Table</title>
        <tgroup cols="3">
          <colspec align="left">
          <colspec align="center">
          <colspec align="right">
          <thead>
            <row>
              <entry>Powers of Ten</entry>
              <entry>Planets</entry>
              <entry>Dollars</entry>
            </row>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <row>
              <entry>10</entry>
              <entry>Earth</entry>
              <entry>$1</entry>
            </row>
            <row>
              <entry>100</entry>
              <entry>Mercury</entry>
              <entry>$5</entry>
            </row>
            <row>
              <entry>1000</entry>
              <entry>Mars</entry>
              <entry>$10</entry>
            </row>
            <row>
              <entry>10000</entry>
              <entry>Venus</entry>
              <entry>$20</entry>
            </row>
            <row>
              <entry>100000</entry>
              <entry>Jupiter, Saturn</entry>
              <entry>$50</entry>
            </row>
          </tbody>
        </tgroup>
      </table>

  Formatting Codes
    Pod formatting codes render directly into DocBook as inline elements:

    *   "I<text>"

          <emphasis role="italic">text</emphasis>

    *   "B<text>"

          <emphasis role="bold">text</emphasis>

    *   "C<code>"

          <literal role="code"><![CDATA[code]] ></literal>

    *   "L<name>"

          <citerefentry><refentrytitle>name</refentrytitle></citerefentry>

    *   "L<name(n)>"

          <citerefentry><refentrytitle>name</refentrytitle>
          <manvolnum>n</manvolnum></citerefentry>

    *   "L<name/"sec">" or "L<name/sec>"

          <quote>sec</quote> in <citerefentry>
          <refentrytitle>name</refentrytitle></citerefentry>

    *   "L<name(n)/"sec">" or "L<name(n)/sec>"

    *   "L</"sec">" or "L</sec>" or "L<"sec">"

          <link linkend="article-My-Article-sec"><quote>sec</quote></link>

    *   "L<text|name>"

          text

    *   "L<text|name/"sec">" or "L<text|name/sec>"

          text

    *   "L<text|/"sec">" or "L<text|/sec>" or "L<text|"sec">"

          <link linkend="article-My-Article-sec"><quote>text</quote></link>

    *   "L<scheme:...>"

          <ulink url="scheme:...">scheme:...</ulink>

    *   "E<verbar>"

          |

    *   "E<sol>"

          /

    *   "E<number>"

          &#number;

    *   any other "E<escape>"

          &escape;

    *   "F<filename>"

        <filename>filename</filename>

    *   "S<text with spaces>"

         text&nbsp;with&nbsp;spaces

    *   "X<topic name>"

        <indexterm><primary>topic name</primary></indexterm>

DIAGNOSTICS
    Pod::2::DocBook makes every possible effort to produce valid DocBook
    markup, even with malformed POD source. Any processing errors will be
    noted in comments at the end of the output document. Even when errors
    occur, Pod::2::DocBook always reads the entire input document and never
    exits with a non-zero status.

    unknown command `%s' at line %d in file %s
        See "Command Paragraph" in perlpod for a list of valid commands. The
        command referenced in the error message was ignored.

    formatting code `%s' nested within `%s' at line %d in file %s
        See "Formatting Codes" in perlpod for details on which formatting
        codes can be nested. The offending code was translated into the
        output document as the raw text inside its angle brackets.

    unknown formatting code `%s' at line in file %s
        The input contained a formatting code not listed in perlpod; it was
        translated into the output document as the raw text inside the angle
        brackets.

    empty L<> at line %d in file %s
        Self-explanatory.

    invalid escape `%s' at line %d in file %s
        Self-explanatory; it was translated into the output document as the
        raw text inside the angle brackets.

    =item must be inside an =over ... =back section at line %d in file %s
        Self-explanatory. The `=item' referenced in the error was ignored.

    `=end %s' found but current region opened with `=begin %s'
        The closest `=end' command to the referenced `=begin' didn't match;
        processing continued as if the mismatched `=end' wasn't there.

    no matching `=end' for `=begin %s'
        Pod::2::DocBook reached the end of its input without finding an
        `=end' command to match the `=begin' referenced in the error;
        end-of-file processing continued.

    unknown colspec `%s' in table at line %d in file %s
        See "Simple Tables" for a list of supported column specifications.

    encountered unknown state `%s' (this should never happen)
        The state referred to is an internal variable used to properly
        manage nested DocBook structures. You should indeed never see this
        message, but if you do, you should contact the module's author.

AUTHOR
    Alligator Descartes <descarte@symbolstone.org> wrote a module called
    Pod::2::DocBook, which was later maintained by Jan Iven
    <jan.iven@cern.ch>. That module was based on the original pod2html by
    Tom Christiansen <tchrist@mox.perl.com>.

    Nandu Shah <nandu@zvolve.com> wrote Pod::DocBook, which is unrelated to
    the previous module (even though they both perform the same function).
    (<http://search.cpan.org/~nandu/Pod-DocBook-1.2/>)

    Jozef Kutej <jkutej@cpan.org> renamed the module to Pod::2::DocBook
    because Nandus version was buried in the CPAN archive as an
    "UNAUTHORIZED RELEASE".
