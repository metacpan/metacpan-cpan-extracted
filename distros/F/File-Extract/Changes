0.04 - 27 Oct 2005
  - Hmm, shouldn't be creating distros at 3:00 am. MANIFEST didn't get
    updated properly, so a lot of files were missing.
  - Add File::Extract::PDF (experimental)

0.03 - 27 Oct 2005 
  - Added filters! Thanks to Tatsuhiko Miyagawa for the inspiration and advice
  - Fix F::E::Plain's return value (should have been F::E::Result)
  - Make sure recode() is called before creating F::E::Result
  - Add register_filter()

  *** Backward Incompatible Changes ***
  - rename register() to register_processor().
  - Change F::E::Result API. Now results have a metadata field, which can
    contain anything other than the text field. Also, now F::E::Result has
    mandatory fields 'filename', 'mime_type', 'text'.

0.02 - 26 Oct 2005
