[V 0.84]
Date=2013-06-28T11:51:00
Comments= <<EOT
- Add data/sample.6.ged to match data/sample.5.ged, to cover the 2 types of dates within the header.
One case (sample.5.ged) is used where a TIME is allowed, and the other where it is not.
- Active the debug flag in t/date.t to try exposing test failures for '15 Jul 1954'.

Comments= <<EOT
- Rename CHANGES to Changes as per CPAN::Changes::SPEC.
- Remove the HTML templates called rainbow*, because they were never used.
- Update pre-preqs' version #s, especially for DateTime and DateTime::Infinite, to see if that fixes
mysterious CPAN Tester failures with t/date.t's use of '15 Jul 1954'.
Also, we now require Genealogy::Gedcom::Date V 1.08, which has the same DateTime pre-reqs.
