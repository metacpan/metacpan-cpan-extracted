NAME
    URL::Encode - Encoding and decoding of
    "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" encoding.

SYNOPSIS
        $octets = url_decode($octets);
        $string = url_decode_utf8($octets);
    
        $octets = url_encode($octets);
        $octets = url_encode_utf8($string);
    
        $params = url_params_flat($octets [, $utf8 = false]);
        $params = url_params_mixed($octets [, $utf8 = false]);
        $params = url_params_multi($octets [, $utf8 = false]);
                  url_params_each($octets, $callback [, $utf8 = false]);

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides functions to encode and decode strings into and
    from the "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" encoding.

    The "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" format encodes a ordered data
    sets of pairs consisting of a name and a value, with pairs seperated by
    ampersand or semicolon and names and values seperated by the equal sign.
    Space characters are replaced with plus sign and any characters not in
    the unreserved character set is encoded using the percent-encoding
    scheme also used for resource identifiers. A percent-encoded octet is
    encoded as a character triplet, consisting of the percent character "%"
    followed by the two hexadecimal digits representing that octet's numeric
    value.

    The unreserved character set includes the uppercase and lowercase
    letters, decimal digits, hyphen, period, underscore, and tilde.

FUNCTIONS
  url_decode
        $octets = url_decode($octets);

    Returns a decoded representation of the given URL-encoded $octets as an
    octet string.

  url_decode_utf8
        $string = url_decode_utf8($octets);

    Returns a decoded representation of the given URL-encoded $octets in
    UTF-8 encoding as a character string.

  url_encode
        $octets = url_encode($octets);

    Returns a URL-encoded representation of the given $octets as an octet
    string.

  url_encode_utf8
        $octets = url_encode_utf8($string);

    Returns a URL-encoded representation of $string in UTF-8 encoding as an
    octet string.

  url_params_flat
        $params = url_params_flat($octets);
        $params = url_params_flat($octets, $utf8);

    Parses a URL-encoded data set of name/value pairs from the given octets.
    Returns an ARRAY reference containing the URL-decoded name/value pairs
    in order.

        $params = url_params_flat('foo=A&foo=B&bar=C');
        $params; # [ foo => 'A', foo => 'B', bar => 'C' ]

  url_params_mixed
        $params = url_params_mixed($octets);
        $params = url_params_mixed($octets, $utf8);

    Parses a URL-encoded data set of name/value pairs from the given octets.
    Returns a HASH reference containing the URL-decoded name/value pairs.
    Multiple occurrences of a parameter will result in an ARRAY reference
    holding all the values for that parameter in order.

        $params = url_params_mixed('foo=A&foo=B&bar=C');
        $params; # { foo => [ 'A', 'B' ], bar => 'C' }

  url_params_multi
        $params = url_params_multi($octets);
        $params = url_params_multi($octets, $utf8);

    Parses a URL-encoded data set of name/value pairs from the given octets.
    Returns a HASH reference containing the URL-decoded name/value pairs.
    Values are stored in an ARRAY reference.

        $params = url_params_multi('foo=A&foo=B&bar=C');
        $params; # { foo => [ 'A', 'B' ], bar => [ 'C' ] }

  url_params_each
        url_params_each($octets, $callback);
        url_params_each($octets, $callback, $utf8);

    Parses a URL-encoded data set of name/value pairs from the given octets.
    Invokes the given callback for each URL-decoded name/value pair.

        $callback = sub {
            my ($name, $value) = @_;
        };
    
        url_params_each($octets, $callback);

EXPORTS
    None by default. All functions can be exported using the ":all" tag or
    individually.

DIAGNOSTICS
    (F) Usage: %s
        Subroutine called with wrong number of arguments.

    (F) Wide character in octet string
    (F) Malformed UTF-8 in URL-decoded octets

PERFORMANCE
    The URL::Encode::XS module provides faster C/XS implementations of the
    functions found in this module. This module will automatically use
    URL::Encode::XS if it's installed.
