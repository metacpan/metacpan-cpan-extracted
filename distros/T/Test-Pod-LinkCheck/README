NAME

    Test::Pod::LinkCheck - Tests POD for invalid links

VERSION

      This document describes v0.008 of Test::Pod::LinkCheck - released November 01, 2014 as part of Test-Pod-LinkCheck.

SYNOPSIS

            #!/usr/bin/perl
            use strict; use warnings;
    
            use Test::More;
    
            eval "use Test::Pod::LinkCheck";
            if ( $@ ) {
                    plan skip_all => 'Test::Pod::LinkCheck required for testing POD';
            } else {
                    Test::Pod::LinkCheck->new->all_pod_ok;
            }

DESCRIPTION

    This module looks for any links in your POD and verifies that they
    point to a valid resource. It uses the Pod::Simple parser to analyze
    the pod files and look at their links. In a nutshell, it looks for
    L<Foo> links and makes sure that Foo exists. It also recognizes section
    links, L</SYNOPSIS> for example. Also, manpages are resolved and
    checked.

    This module does NOT check "http" links like L<http://www.google.com>
    in your pod. For that, please check out Test::Pod::No404s.

    Normally, you wouldn't want this test to be run during end-user
    installation because they might not have the modules installed! It is
    HIGHLY recommended that this be used only for module authors'
    RELEASE_TESTING phase. To do that, just modify the synopsis to add an
    env check :)

    This module normally uses the OO method to run tests, but you can use
    the functional style too. Just explicitly ask for the all_pod_ok or
    pod_ok function to be imported when you use this module.

            #!/usr/bin/perl
            use strict; use warnings;
            use Test::Pod::LinkCheck qw( all_pod_ok );
            all_pod_ok();

ATTRIBUTES

 check_cpan

    If enabled, this module will check the CPAN module database to see if a
    link is a valid CPAN module or not. It uses the backend defined in
    "cpan_backend" to do the actual searching.

    If disabled, it will resolve links based on locally installed modules.
    If it isn't installed it will be an error!

    The default is: true

 cpan_backend

    Selects the CPAN backend to use for querying modules. The available
    ones are: CPANPLUS, CPAN, CPANSQLite, MetaDB, MetaCPAN, and CPANIDX.

    The default is: CPANPLUS

            The backends were tested and verified against those versions. Older versions should work, but is untested!
                    CPANPLUS v0.9010
                    CPAN v1.9402
                    CPAN::SQLite v0.199
                    CPAN::Common::Index::MetaDB v0.005
                    MetaCPAN::API::Tiny v1.131730
                    MetaCPAN::Client v1.007001
                    LWP::UserAgent v6.06

 cpan_backend_auto

    Enable to automatically try the CPAN backends to find an available one.
    It will try the backends in the order defined in "cpan_backend"

    If no backend is available, it will disable the "check_cpan" attribute
    and enable the "cpan_section_err" attribute.

    The default is: true

 cpan_section_err

    If enabled, a link pointing to a CPAN module's specific section is
    treated as an error if it isn't installed.

    The default is: false

 verbose

    If enabled, this module will print extra diagnostics for the links it's
    checking.

    The default is: copy $ENV{HARNESS_IS_VERBOSE} or $ENV{TEST_VERBOSE} or
    false

METHODS

 pod_ok

    Accepts the filename to check, and an optional test name.

    This method will pass the test if there is no POD links present in the
    POD or if all links are not an error. Furthermore, if the POD was
    malformed as reported by Pod::Simple, the test will fail and not
    attempt to check the links.

    When it fails, this will show any failing links as diagnostics. Also,
    some extra information is printed if verbose is enabled.

    The default test name is: "LinkCheck test for FILENAME"

 all_pod_ok

    Accepts an optional array of files to check. By default it uses all POD
    files in your distribution.

    This method is what you will usually run. Every file is passed to the
    "pod_ok" function. This also sets the test plan to be the number of
    files.

NOTES

 backend

    This module uses the CPANPLUS and CPAN modules as the backend to verify
    valid CPAN modules. Please make sure that the backend you choose is
    properly configured before running this! This means the index is
    updated, permissions is set, and whatever else the backend needs to
    properly function. If you don't want to use them please disable the
    "check_cpan" attribute.

    If this module fails to check CPAN modules or the testsuite fails, it's
    probably because of the above reason.

 CPAN module sections

    One limitation of this module is that it can't check for valid sections
    on CPAN modules if they aren't installed. If you want that to be an
    error, please enable the "cpan_section_err" attribute.
