0.05 2010-09-08

- Update not required

- Added wrapper on validate method, so we now also export a
  validatePO, which is less intrusive [BDKPO-2]

- Added prerequisites test [BDKPO-1]

- Beautified code with Perl::Tidy and did basic Perl::Critic
  violation cleanup


0.04 2007-03-13

- Added some POD, nothing significant

- Fixed problem in t/critic.t, I had implemented a mix of my own
  and the recommended Perl::Critic test, so it gave unforseen test failures


0.03 2007-03-12

- Set severity of Perl::Critic test to 5, gentle

- Updated t/kwalitee.t to more contemporary version

- Added Perl::Critic test, t/critic.t and added perlcriticrc to t/

- Updated to more contemporary versions of:
    t/pod-coverage.t
    t/pod.t

  These should be there for the quality, but will not be run as a
  part of the normal test run, unless the TEST_POD environment
  variable is set.

  This seem to be the defacto way of doing things.

- Added related module to SEE ALSO section in POD

- Added private message to EXPORT_OK and updated POD

- Added use of MODULUS_OPERAND in one place, apparently this had
  been overlooked

- Removed some verbose message from unit-tests

- Restructured tests some positive tests are first in the file
