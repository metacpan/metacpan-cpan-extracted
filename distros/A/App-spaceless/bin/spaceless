=head1 NAME

spaceless - Remove spaces and other hazards from your PATH 

=head1 VERSION

version 0.08

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Convert PATH (by default):

 cygwin% spaceless
 PATH=/usr/bin:/cygdrive/c/PROGRA~2/NVIDIA~1/PhysX/Common:...
 export PATH

Convert another PATH style environment variable

 cygwin% spaceless PERL5LIB
 PERL5LIB=/PERL~1/lib:/PERL~2/lib
 export PERL5LIB

Update the PATH in the current shell (works with both sh and csh):

 cygwin% eval `spaceless PATH`

Same thing from C<cmd.exe> or C<command.com> prompt:

 C:\> spaceless PATH -f path.bat
 C:\> path.bat

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Although legal in most modern operating system directory names, spaces are only
frequently encountered in Windows.  This can be troublesome for some tools that
do not take such antics into account.  Fortunately, Windows provides alternate 
file and directory names for any name that is not compatible with MS DOS.  Since
spaces were never supported by MS DOS we can use these alternate names for tools
that don't take spaces into account.

L<spaceless> converts PATH style environment variables on windows into equivalents
that do not have spaces.  By default it uses L<Shell::Guess> to make a reasonable
guess as to the shell you are currently using (not your login shell).  You may
alternately specify a specific shell type using one of the options below.

L<spaceless> will not convert long directory (non 8.3 format) names that do not
have spaces, as these are usually handled gracefully by scripts that are space
challenged.

=head1 OPTIONS

=head2 --cmd

Generate cmd.exe configuration

=head2 --command

Generate command.com configuration

=head2 --csh

Generate c shell configuration

=head2 -f I<filename>

Write configuration to I<filename> instead of standard output

=head2 --expand | -x

Expand short paths to long paths (adding any spaces that may be back in)

=head2 --fish

Generate fish shell configuration

=head2 --help

Print help message and exit

=head2 --korn

Generate korn shell configuration

=head2 --list | -l

Instead of generating a shell configuration, list the directories
in the given path style variable

=head2 --login

Use the your default login shell (as determined by L<Shell::Guess>)
On Unix style systems this consults the C<GECOS> field in the
C</etc/passwd> file or uses NIS.  On other platforms it may use
another means to determine your login shell, or simply make an
informed guess based on the platform.

=head2 --no-cygwin

Remove any cygwin paths.  Has no affect on non cygwin platforms.

=head2 --power

Generate Power shell configuration

=head2 --sh

Generate bourne shell configuration

=head2 --sep I<char> | --sep-in I<char> | --sep-out I<char>

You can use these options to change the path separator character.
Normally you do not need to set this.  the Platform default is used for
input (C<:> for Unix and cygwin, and C<;> for Windows) and the shell
default is used for output (C<:> for sh and csh, and C<;> for C<command.com>
and C<cmd.exe>).  But in some situation you might want a UNIX style path
in a C<cmd.exe> script.  Any character may be specified, but keep in mind
that not all characters are supported by L<Shell::Config::Generate>.

=head2 --squash | -s

Remove duplicate paths from the given path style variable.

=head2 --trim | -t

Trim non-existing directories.  This is a good idea since such directories can 
sometimes cause L<spaceless> to die.

=head2 --version | v

Print version number and exit

=head1 EXAMPLES

=head2 Removing spaces from the PATH on Cygwin

My motivation for writing this script was trying to get L<perlbrew> to work on Cygwin.
Since Windows frequently includes spaces in its C<%PATH%> environment variable, and
cygwin inherits them.

 xian-x86_64% source ~/perl5/perlbrew/etc/cshrc
 setenv: Too many arguments.
 xian-x86_64% eval `spaceless PATH`
 xian-x86_64% source ~/perl5/perlbrew/etc/cshrc
 xian-x86_64%

I could have manually updated my C<%PATH%> to not include spaces, or better yet submitted
a patch to L<perlbrew> to fix its spacing problem.  This probably won't be the last script
that I will have the spaces in the C<%PATH%> problem with.

=head2 Visualizing the PATH

Reading the C<%PATH%> variable can be difficult, especially if you have already
removed the spaces and are using the short version.

 C:\> echo %PATH%
 N:\lang\perl\strawberry\x86\5.18.2\c\bin;N:\lang\perl\strawberry
 \x86\5.18.2\perl\site\bin;N:\lang\perl\strawberry\x86\5.18.2\per
 l\bin;n:\program32\GnuWin32\bin;C:\PROGRA~2\NVIDIA~1\PhysX\Commo
 n;C:\Windows\system32;C:\Windows;C:\Windows\System32\Wbem;C:\Win
 dows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\;C:\PROGRA~1\MICROS~3\110\T
 ools\Binn\;C:\PROGRA~2\Git\cmd;N:\lang\tcl\x86\8.6.1.0\bin;C:\PR
 OGRA~2\NVIDIA~1\PhysX\Common;C:\PROGRA~2\Intel\ICLSCL~1\;C:\PROG
 RA~1\Intel\ICLSCL~1\;C:\Windows\system32;C:\Windows;C:\Windows\S
 ystem32\Wbem;C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\;

You can use the C<-l> (short for C<--list>) and C<-x> (short for C<--expand>) options to
make it a little more readable

 C:\> spaceless -l -x
 N:\lang\perl\strawberry\x86\5.18.2\c\bin
 N:\lang\perl\strawberry\x86\5.18.2\perl\site\bin
 N:\lang\perl\strawberry\x86\5.18.2\perl\bin
 N:\program32\GnuWin32\bin
 C:\Program Files (x86)\NVIDIA Corporation\PhysX\Common
 ...

=head2 Remove duplicate directories in the path

You can use the C<-s> (short for C<--squeeze>) option to squeeze out duplicate paths.
It keeps the first instance of a directory in a path style variable, which is usually
what you want.

 % spaceless -l
 /usr/local/bin
 /usr/bin
 /bin
 /usr/local/bin
 % spaceless -s -l
 /usr/local/bin
 /usr/bin
 /bin

You can then update the C<PATH> with the eval trick:

 % eval `spaceless -s`

=head1 CAVEATS

Short names with the 8.3 spaceless naming convention can be turned off using tweaks
to the windows registry (see L<https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc959352.aspx>).
This program would not be of much use on such a system.
