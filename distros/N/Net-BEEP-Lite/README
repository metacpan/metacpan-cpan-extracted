Net::BEEP::Lite version 0.05
============================

Net::BEEP::Lite is a lightweight implementation of a BEEP (RFC 3080,
RFC 3081) client/server framework.  This package is intended for
implementing fairly simple BEEP clients and servers.  It does not
attempt to be the last word on using BEEP in Perl.  Or to put this
another way, this package does not make an attempt to support every
feature or mode of operation possible within the BEEP specification.

It does not use threading, and thus cannot directly handle multiple
ansynchronous channels.  It does not directly support peer-to-peer
operations.  Or at least not yet.

See the included POD documentation and the DESIGN_NOTES for help in
using this package.  Also, there is a sample client and server in the
testing directory (test_echo_server.pl and test_echo_client.pl). They
do not exercise the entire API, but they may be helpful in getting
started.
