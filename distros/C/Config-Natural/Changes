2004.07.04 - 0.99_10
  - This release replaces the previous one, incorrectly numbered 1.00_01. 

2004.05.09 - 1.00b1
  - Added new semantic upon request by Vladi Belperchinov-Shabanski: 
    values can be appended using += instead of =. See the doc for more. 

2004.05.08 - 1.00b1
  - Fixed a bug discovered by Vladi Belperchinov-Shabanski: a multiline 
    value without its ending character would make Config::Natural loops 
    endlessly. Same for arrays. 

2004.04.01 - 0.99
  - Option 'auto_create_surrounding_list' is now disabled by default. 
  - Documentation was updated. 

2004.03.30 - 0.99b6
  - Added support for array parameters, upon request by Vladi 
    Belperchinov-Shabanski. ->value_of() and dump_param() have 
    been updated to handle this new data type.
  - Changed test 02 in 11dump.t: now using ->dump_param() instead 
    of Data::Dumper. 

2004.03.03 - 0.99b5
  - Merge two new features proposed by Vladi Belperchinov-Shabanski: 
    method param_tree(), which returns a tree giving direct access to 
    the internal tree, and the 'strip_indentation' to automatically 
    strip indentation from multilines values. 
  - Corrected a small bug in AUTOLOAD. 

2004.02.03 - 0.99b4
  - Corrected a big dumb bug (probably present since a long time): creating 
    two objects in the same program resulted in a collision, the objects 
    sharing their memory, and therefore their data. 
  - Accessors are now implemented with AUTOLOAD. 

2004.01.27
  - Added examples/filter-file-slurp.pl.

2004.01.14 - 0.99b3
