Revision history for Perl extension Geo::ReadGRIB.

0.01  Fri Apr 21 05:45:54 2006
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.23 with options
		-X -b 5.6.0 -n Geo::ReadGRIB

0.40  Sat May 27

        - Added a tempfile() method based on File::Tmp to name
          temp filed so had to change Perl version to "use 5.6.1"
        - Each method that uses wgrib.exe now uses tempfile() to
          name temp files and then removes them when done. 
        - Changed tests to use full path to test GRIB file
        - POD doc tweaks	 

0.50  June 12

        - New method extractLaLo() extracts forecast data for a given
          type and time for a range of locations. The locations will be
          all (lat, long) points in the GRIB file inside the rectangular
          area defined by (lat1, long1) and (lat2, long2) where lat1
          >= lat2 and long1 <= long2.  - that is, lat1 is north or lat2
          and long1 is west of long2 (or the same as...)

0.51  July 10 2006

        - Added END block and signal handlers to clean up temp files on
          close or interruptions.
        - Added new method getParam() to return values of selected 
          parameters useful to users.  

0.98  March 6 2009

        - Added Geo::ReadGRIB::Place and Geo::ReadGRIB::PlaceIterator
          classes.
        - extractLaLo() now returns a PlaceIterator object;  
        - Deprecated getCatalog() and getCatalogVerbose(). Getting the 
          offset index for each data type and time is now done during 
          object creation.

0.99  Oct 2009

        - A major bug fix release to support Canadian high res gribs.
        - Add a check for GDS byte 6 = 0. Croak if a not (yet) supported
          grid other than lat/long.
        - Discover scan mode from byte 28. Many changes to support south
          to north scanning. Will also print advisory messages if it 
          detects as yet unsupported modes.
        - Some refactoring and new tests. 
        - extract() now returns a PlaceIterator object like extractLaLo
          does.  

1.0   Oct 2009

        - Some documentation changes and minor adjustments. Verification
          of new GRIB type support justified finally moving to v1.0

1.1   Oct 2009

        - Bug fix release for rt.cpan.org ticket #50820 where new test
          fails for some values only on 64bit uselongdouble Perl 

1.2   Nov 2009

        - Improved extractLaLo() by reading all rows from (la1, lo1) to
          (la2, lo2) into a scalar in one read. This will get more data 
          than needed in many cases, but the temporary increase in memory
          footprint will typically be less than a megabyte. Speed increases
          grater that %35 were measured on large extracts. 

1.21  Nov 2009

        - Add tests and doc to improve "kwalitee" (already 104.35%)
        - Add and improve range testing methods in accord with DRY 
          principle and to remove range test from lalo2offset which 
          is called many times when using extractLaLo()

1.3  Jan 2010

        - Bug fix release for rt.cpan.org ticket #53494 where CMC gribs
          require a different interpretation of PDS octets 19 and 20
        - Added fix to cover changes made for fix

1.4  March 2010

        - extractLaLo() no longer saves extracted data to the object by
          default. The new method backflip() turns this behavior back on.
        - A test was added for backflip()
        - Changes made to Makefile.PL to support the cc compiler on Solaris
          and give a helpful message for those with a different compiler 
          than Perl was built with.
