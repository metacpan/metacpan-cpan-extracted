NAME

    Lingua::StopWords - Stop words for several languages.

SYNOPSIS

        use Lingua::StopWords qw( getStopWords );
        my $stopwords = getStopWords('en');
    
        my @words = qw( i am the walrus goo goo g'joob );
    
        # prints "walrus goo goo g'joob"
        print join ' ', grep { !$stopwords->{$_} } @words;

DESCRIPTION

    In keyword search, it is common practice to suppress a collection of
    "stopwords": words such as "the", "and", "maybe", etc. which exist in
    in a large number of documents and do not tell you anything important
    about any document which contains them. This module provides such
    "stoplists" in several languages.

FUNCTIONS

 getStopWords

        my $stoplist      = getStopWords('en');
        my $utf8_stoplist = getStopWords('en', 'UTF-8');

    Retrieve a stoplist in the form of a hashref where the keys are all
    stopwords and the values are all 1.

        $stoplist = {
            and => 1,
            if  => 1,
            # ...
        };

    getStopWords() expects 1-2 arguments. The first, which is required, is
    an ISO code representing a supported language. If the ISO code cannot
    be found, getStopWords returns undef.

    The second argument should be 'UTF-8' if you want the stopwords encoded
    in UTF-8. The UTF-8 flag will be turned on, so make sure you understand
    all the implications of that.

INSTALLATION
