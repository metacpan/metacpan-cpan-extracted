VERSION

    Version 0.06

SYNOPSIS

        use Sql::Textify;
        my $t = Sql::Textify->new;
        my $text = $t->textify( $sql );
    
        use Sql::Textify;
        my $t = Sql::Textify->new(
            conn => 'dbi:connection:string',
            username => 'username',
                password => 'password',
            format => 'markdown',
        );
        my $text = $t->textify( $sql );

SYNTAX

    This module executes SQL queries and produces text output (markdown,
    html). Connection details, username and password can be specified in a
    C-style multiline comment inside the SQL query:

        /*
            conn="dbi:SQLite:dbname=test.sqlite3"
            username="myusername"
            password="mypassword"
        */
        select * fom gardens;

    or they can be specified using the constructor:

        my $t = new Sql::Textify(
            conn => 'dbi:SQLite:dbname=test.sqlite3',
            username => 'myusername',
            password => 'mypassword'
        );
        my $text = $t->textify('select * from gardens');

    multiple queries can be separated by ; and also
    insert/update/create/etc. queries are supported. If the query doesn't
    return any row the string 0 rows will be returned.

OPTIONS

    Sql::Textify supports a number of options to its processor which
    control the behaviour of the output document.

    The options for the processor are:

    format
