NAME
    File::Compressible - determine if a mime type is compressible

SYNOPSIS
      use File::Compressible 'compressible';
      use File::Type;
      ...
      my $ft = File::Type->new();
      for my $file (@files) {
        my $type = checktype_filename($file);
        next unless $type;
        next unless compressible($type);
        # do some compression magic!
      }

DESCRIPTION
    File::Compressible supplies one exportable function, "compressible",
    which takes a mime type and returns true if it is compressible, undef if
    not.

    Compressible mime types are stored in a package variable,
    @File::Compressible::compressible. It is concidered okay to modify this
    list and future versioins will maintain this. A second package variable
    contains precompiled regular expressions that are tested against passed
    mime types, it is named @File::Compressible::compressible_re.
