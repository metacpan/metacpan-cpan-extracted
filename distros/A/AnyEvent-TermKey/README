NAME
    "AnyEvent::TermKey" - terminal key input using "libtermkey" with
    "AnyEvent"

SYNOPSIS
     use AnyEvent::TermKey qw( FORMAT_VIM KEYMOD_CTRL );
     use AnyEvent;
 
     my $cv = AnyEvent->condvar;
 
     my $aetk = AnyEvent::TermKey->new(
        term => \*STDIN,
 
        on_key => sub {
           my ( $key ) = @_;
 
           print "Got key: ".$key->termkey->format_key( $key, FORMAT_VIM )."\n";
 
           $cv->send if $key->type_is_unicode and
                        $key->utf8 eq "C" and
                        $key->modifiers & KEYMOD_CTRL;
        },
     );
 
     $cv->recv;

DESCRIPTION
    This class implements an asynchronous perl wrapper around the
    "libtermkey" library, which provides an abstract way to read keypress
    events in terminal-based programs. It yields structures that describe
    keys, rather than simply returning raw bytes as read from the TTY
    device.

    It internally uses an instance of Term::TermKey to access the underlying
    C library. For details on general operation, including the
    representation of keypress events as objects, see the documentation on
    that class.

    Proxy methods exist for normal accessors of "Term::TermKey", and the
    usual behaviour of the "getkey" or other methods is instead replaced by
    the "on_key" event.

CONSTRUCTOR
  $aetk = AnyEvent::TermKey->new( %args )
    This function returns a new instance of a "AnyEvent::TermKey" object. It
    takes the following named arguments:

    term => IO or INT
            Optional. File handle or POSIX file descriptor number for the
            file handle to use as the connection to the terminal. If not
            supplied "STDIN" will be used.

    on_key => CODE
            CODE reference to the key-event handling callback. Will be
            passed an instance of a "Term::TermKey::Key" structure:

             $on_key->( $key )

METHODS
  $tk = $aetk->termkey
    Returns the "Term::TermKey" object being used to access the "libtermkey"
    library. Normally should not be required; the proxy methods should be
    used instead. See below.

  $flags = $aetk->get_flags
  $aetk->set_flags( $flags )
  $canonflags = $aetk->get_canonflags
  $aetk->set_canonflags( $canonflags )
  $msec = $aetk->get_waittime
  $aetk->set_waittime( $msec )
  $str = $aetk->get_keyname( $sym )
  $sym = $aetk->keyname2sym( $keyname )
  ( $ev, $button, $line, $col ) = $aetk->interpret_mouse( $key )
  $str = $aetk->format_key( $key, $format )
  $key = $aetk->parse_key( $str, $format )
  $key = $aetk->parse_key_at_pos( $str, $format )
  $cmp = $aetk->keycmp( $key1, $key2 )
    These methods all proxy to the "Term::TermKey" object, and allow
    transparent use of the "AnyEvent::TermKey" object as if it was a
    subclass. Their arguments, behaviour and return value are therefore
    those provided by that class. For more detail, see the Term::TermKey
    documentation.
