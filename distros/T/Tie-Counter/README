DESCRIPTION
    "Tie::Counter" allows you to tie a scalar in such a way that it
    increments each time it is used. This might be useful for interpolating
    counters in strings.

    The tie takes an optional extra argument, the first value of the
    counter, defaulting to 0. Any argument for which magical increment is
    defined on is allowed. Assigning to the counter will set a new value.
