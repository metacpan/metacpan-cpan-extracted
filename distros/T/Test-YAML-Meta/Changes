0.09    2008-03-28
        - purely a cosmetic release to render the Makefile.PL time issues, that
          have generated bogus FAIL reports in previous releases, null
          and void.

0.08    2008-03-17
        - it helps when you fix all the versioning too!

0.07    2008-03-17
        - fixed licensing list (adding Artistic2). (Bernhard Schmalhofer)
        - value for license is mandatory, but the actual value could be any
              string. Therefore the license() function now returns 1 if the given
          value is a known license type, returns 2 if a value is given, or 0
          if no value is given.
        - hashref returned of the parsed META.yml file, by both meta_spec_ok()
          and meta_yaml_ok(), in the event the user wishes to perform addition
          checks on the values of the hash keys. (Adam Kennedy)
        - added t/05metaspec.t test file.

0.06    2007-11-05
        - fixed RT#29457: distribution_type is not mandatory in spec 1.2 (domm)

0.05    2007-11-02
        - a curious error report fails validating META.yml the first time, but
          is okay the second time. As such I'm removing the 93metavalid.t as 
          the test is redundant now.

0.04    2007-05-15
        - provided better error reporting (spec chain and validating version)
        - added a new test file, supplied by Jochen Stenzel, which highlights
          an error in the way the author line was created.
        - bumped the Test::More version required, due to a bugfix in 
          Test::Builder:Tester.
        - provided a cleaner way to report undef values as errors
        - added lots more tests for edge cases
        - finally sorted the Test::Builder::Tester tests in 04metatester.t
        - Devel::Cover = 95.6%

0.03    2007-02-27
        - POD & comment updates
        - removed 92distribution.t test as it can't detect that YAML::Syck is 
          optional
        - fixed a misunderstanding of mine from the META.yml specification.

0.02    2007-02-27
        - Fixed a bug in detecting module name

0.01    2007-02-27
        - Initial release.
        - Devel::Cover = 91.7%
