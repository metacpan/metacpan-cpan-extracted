DESCRIPTION
    This is a DBIx::Class component to make full-text indexing a seamless
    part of database objects. All that is required is the registration of
    desired fields for the index. Notice that fields are not necessarily the
    same as columns. For instance, suppose you have a schema representing a
    film and its actors. The index representing the film table may have a
    fields called 'actor' which can have multiple values, depending on the
    number of actors associated with the film.

        package Film;
    
        __PACKAGE__->add_index_fields(
            actor => {
                type   => 'text',
                source => 'actors.name'
            },
        );
    
METHODS
  new( \%connect_info, $source_class )
    Instantiates a new Lucene Web Service indexer.

  setup_index( $source, $index )
    If the index does not yet exist, this method will create it for you.

  setup_fields( $source )
    Normalizes the index fields so they all have hashref members with a
    "type" key at a minimum. It all attemps to figure out which field will
    be used as the primary identifier and what field might be used for the
    last updated column (optional).

  field_for_role( $source, $role )
    Looks through the field list for a member with role equal to $role.

  value_for_field( $object, $key )
    Uses the indexed fields information to determine how to get the values
    for $key out of $object.

  as_document( [ $document ] )
    If a document is passed to the method, it will replaces the document's
    current fields with those outlined by the source's registered fields. If
    no document is passed, it will construct a new
    WebService::Lucene::Document object, populate it, and return it.

  insert( $object )
    Calls "update_or_create_document".

  update( $object )
    Calls "update_or_create_document".

  delete( $object )
    Deletes document from the index.

  update_or_create_document( $object )
    Will either update or add a document to the index, depending on its
    existence in the index.
