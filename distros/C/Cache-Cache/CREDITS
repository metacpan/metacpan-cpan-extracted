  helped debug the make test failure (due to fileglobs in Makefile.PL) on 
  Windows

- Christian Gilmore <cgilmore at tivoli.com> suggested that I expose the
  get_namespaces method through the Cache interface

- Randal Schwartz <merlyn at stonehenge.com> discovered a nasty bug on
  the construction of cache instances that use the auto_purge_interval

- Chris Fairbanks <cfairbanks at site59.com> helped think through
  the factory-like model for construction using private constructors
  that allow for the proper initialization of child classes

- Rob Bloodgood <robb at empire2.com> discovered that the documentation
  should better reflect that size means size in bytes

- Bjorn Jacobsen <maybe at yes.no> suggested that I use the OO interface
  to File::Spec to avoid inadvertently importing those methods into 
  the global namespace

- Jay Sachs <jay at eziba.com> for suggesting and writing the NullCache 
  implementation

- Randal Schwartz <merlyn at stonehenge.com> wrote about an automatic purging
  mechanism for the cache in Web Techniques, and helped me implement
  that feature as part of the framework

- Matt Sly <matt at eziba.com> for catching a bug with erroneously
  importing an unused module
  
- Dave Rolsky <autarch at urth.org> for helping me rewrite the Makefile.PL to
  do conditional installation and testing based on dependency detection

- Greg Cope <greg at rubberplant.freeserve.co.uk> suggested that I switch
  to IPC::ShareLite, and helped debug version 0.05

- Daniel Little <danl at metrex.net> suggested that I write the 
  SizeAwareMemoryCache module

- Jonathan Swartz <jswartz at users.sourceforge.net>, a Perl Cache
  project developer, for the expanded expiration format code and all of
  the great dialog in the list server, continued testing, and
  a million good ideas!  A big thanks, Jonathan.

- Sergey Polyakov <alexei at samara.net> for numerous bug reports and for
  being an early adopter of Perl Cache

# The follow credits were copied from File::Cache, the previous
# incarnation of this library

- David Coppit <david at coppit.org> added: max_size, auto_purge,
  get_stale(), reduce_size(), username, and filemode, fixed a bug that
  prevented expired cache items from being unlinked by purge(), and
  added the get_creation_time() and get_expiration_time() routines. (a
  big thanks David!)  Also, David added the Data::Dumper persistence 
  format for cross-OS operability and greatly improved the documentation,
  and many many other things

- Larry Moore <ljmoore at freespace.net>, a cpan tester, noticed that
  version 0.04 failed to compile on MacOS (thanks Larry!)

- Frey Kuo <frey at engineer.com> pointed out that the example in the
  README was rather buggy.  (thanks Frey!)

- Doug Steinwand <dsteinwand at etoys.com> found that on FreeBSD, the
  _purge routine failed due to an issue with File::Find and even
  provided a fix.  (thanks Doug!)

- Chris Winters <cwinters at intes.net> needed the cache_depth code, so I
  added it, and he was gracious enough to help test it

- Jessica Mintz provided valuable debugging information that tracked
  down the unlink file race

- Jeremy Howard (jhoward at fastmail.fm) added two great patches that
  made File::Cache taint safe, plus he's using it at fastmail.fm!

- Randal L. Schwartz (merlyn at stonehenge.com) caught a version dependency
  on the File::Path, which led to some major changes to the entire
  library finally passing taint checking.  Also, he suggested the
  temp->rename change to _WRITE_FILE. (Thanks Randal!)

- Michael Blakeley (mike at blakeley.com) caught the bug with
  .description files not being readable when the umask is restrictive and 
  offered a patch.  (Thanks Mike!)

- Neil Conway (nconway at klamath.dyndns.org) suggested documenting the 
  optional dependency on Storable, adding a dependency for File::Spec
  0.82, and removing the "use Data::Dumper" line.  (Thanks Neil!)
