NAME
    "Encode::Float" - Encode/decode float as a string for sorting.

SYNOPSIS
      use Encode::Float;
      my $encoder = Encode::Float->new();
      my @list;
      for (my $i = 0 ; $i < 10 ; $i++)
      {
        my $float = (.5 - rand) * 10**int(10 - 20 * rand);
        $float = 0 if $i == 0;
        my $encoded = $encoder->encode($float);
        my $decoded = $encoder->decode($encoded);
        my $error   = $encoder->getRelativeDifference($float, $decoded);
        push @list, [ $encoded, $float, $decoded, $error ];
      }
      @list = sort { $a->[0] cmp $b->[0] } @list;
      foreach (@list)
      {
        print join(',', @$_) . "\n";
      }

DESCRIPTION
    "Encode::Float" encodes and decodes floating point numbers as fixed
    length positive decimal integers that preserve their order (less
    rounding errors), that is, sorting the encoded integers also sorts the
    floating point numbers.

CONSTRUCTOR
  "new"
    The method "new" creates an instance of the "Encode::Float" class with
    the following parameter:

    "digitsOfAccuracy"
         digitsOfAccuracy => 16

        "digitsOfAccuracy" is an optional parameter that sets the number of
        decimal digits to preserve in the floating point number; the default
        is 16.

METHODS
  "encode"
    The method "encode" takes a floating point number as its only parameter
    and returns its integer encoding.

  "decode"
    The method "decode" takes an encoded floating point number (a positive
    integer) and returns its floating point number.

  "getRelativeDifference"
    The method "getRelativeDifference (floatA, floatB)" computes the
    relative difference between the floating point numbers "floatA" and
    "floatB", which is "abs(floatA - floatB)/max(abs(floatA), abs(floatB))"
    or zero if both numbers are zero.

INSTALLATION
    Use CPAN to install the module and all its prerequisites:

      perl -MCPAN -e shell
      >install Encode::Float
