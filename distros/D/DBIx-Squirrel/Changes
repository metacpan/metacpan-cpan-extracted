Revision history for DBIx-Squirrel

1.3.6 2024-08-26 23:00

-   REFACTOR / FIX
    -   The argument partitioning code that isolates transformations
        from bind-values has been re-written to (hopefully) avoid some
        of the complaints evident when testing under some older Perls.
    -   Much of the shitty old code in DBIx::Squirrel::util has been
        reworked and, given its importance, covered by some new and
        comprehensive unit tests.
    -   Made good on an earlier idea to rename the iterator’s execute
        method to start. Within that context, it makes more sense since
        execute could reasonably be thought to require bind-params at
        all call sites, but that isn’t always the case in the iterator
        code. So a different name made sense, and execute has been
        demoted to alias so as not to break anything.
-   DOCUMENTATION
    -   Minor updates.
-   TESTS
    -   Added compile test.
    -   Added some important unit tests.
    -   Monitoring test coverage now. More tests to come in forthcoming
        releases.

  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.3.5 2024-08-26 07:40

-   Fixed a problem recently introduced into how transformation
    pipelines and arguments are partitioned.
-   Fixed the iterator execute method. It used the bleat about missing
    bind- values, but that doesn’t make sense during construction when
    there might legitimately be none. Now calling execute with none of
    the expected bind-values just effectively resets the iterator.
-   Fixed the results code that was breaking due to a missing
    no strict qw/refs/.

1.3.4 2024-08-25 18:30

-   Some refactoring to improve robustness.

1.3.3 2024-08-25 18:15

-   Typos fixed and additions made to POD.
-   Tests no longer jump through hoops to open the SQLite test database
    in read-only mode. I only tried that to see if it would have a
    positive effect on tests segfaulting. I have since simplified
    testing a great deal since the rewrites, so pushing out this release
    to see if it mops-up a couple of red boxes on CPANTs.

1.3.2 2024-08-25 16:45

-   Fixed typos.
-   General improvements and optimisations.
-   Strawberry Perl 5.10.1.1 on MSWin32-x86-multi-thread can’t seem to
    import DBD::SQLite::Constants ‘:file_open’ because is isn’t
    exported. Hopefully, a conditionally workaround solves the issue.
-   Strawberry Perl 5.14.4.1 on MSWin32-x86-multi-thread gives /Can’t
    locate object method “e” via package “warnings”/ error. Added “use
    diagnostics” pragma to all test code in an attempt to coax more
    useful information out.
-   Fixed broken iterator “buffer_size” code - manually set sizes
    weren’t persistent.

1.3.1 2024-08-24 14:10

-   General code improvements.
-   Removed unnecessary imports.
-   Removed call to no longer extant iterator method from
    &DBIx::Squirrel::it::DESTROY.
-   Added the “count_all” method back into the iterator class, as well
    as ensuring that “count” does not affect a future call to “next”.
-   Addressed build failures revealed by the CPAN Testers Matrix:
    -   Rewrote &DBIx::Squirrel::util::args_partition - failed on Perl
        versions <= 5.18.4;
    -   Back to using “strict” and “warnings” - Modern::Perl having some
        issues with a bundle “all” in Perl versions <= 5.14.4.
    -   Perls versions <= 5.13 do not support ${^GLOBAL_PHASE}, so used
        Devel::GlobalDestruction to work around the issue.
    -   Testing under Perls <= 5.13 seems to require “done_testing()”
        for each sub-test, as well as at the end of the test script.
    -   Testing under Perls <= 5.11 does not support sub-test. I can
        live without them, so have refactored the tests not to use them.
        Tests pass under Perl 5.10!
-   The seemingly bottomless pit of joy that is documentation updates.
    I’m pushing this out, knowing that there are gaps in the POD that
    must be filled. I want to get the remaining red issues on the CPANTS
    matrix to go green, hence the expedited release. POD gaps will be
    filled in future point releases.

1.3.0 2024-08-23 21:00

-   Ground-up rewrite of iterators and result-set code.
-   Ground-up rewrite and simplification of test code.
-   More documentation added. This stuff is never finished, and I’ll be
    adding more in future!
-   A lot of refactoring and tidying up completed.

1.2.11 2024-08-18 13:15

-   Fixed typos.
-   Did some internal refactoring.
-   Updated t/lib/T/Constants.pm to ensure that SQLite database
    connections are created with both sqlite_see_if_its_a_number => !!1
    and sqlite_open_flags => SQLITE_OPEN_READONLY flags and re-ran tests
    successfully on macOS under Perl 5.28.1. Action was prompted by CPAN
    Tester report confirming Wstat 139 SEGFAULT on BSD under Perl
    5.28.1; I have no way to replicate this build environment exactly,
    so I’m hoping this fixes the issue. We shall see. Thanks to Chris
    Williams (BINGOS) for the original report.

1.2.10 2024-08-17 17:35

-   Fixed minor typos in POD.
-   Did some internal refactoring.
-   Updated dist.ini: no longer using Dist::Zilla Readme plugin to
    produce README.
-   Updated st.pm: bind_param method no longer drops the third argument
    (bind attributes) before handing-off to &DBI::st::bind_value.
-   No longer quoting hash keys matching /^+$/.

1.2.9 2024-08-17 22:50

-   Reorganised the examples folder and renamed an example script.
-   Added some canned transforms.
-   Added new example script (examples/transformations/02.pl).
-   Added DBD::SQLite to test dependencies, with thanks to Slaven Rezić
    (SREZIC) for the alert.

1.2.8 2024-08-16 18:45

-   Fixed some documentation issues.
-   Removed a redundant line from sample script
    (examples/transformations_1.pl).

1.2.7 2024-08-16 18:00

-   First version, released on an unsuspecting world.
