=head1 NAME

Lucy::Store::LockFactory - Create Locks.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Sys::Hostname qw( hostname );
    my $hostname = hostname() or die "Can't get unique hostname";
    my $folder = Lucy::Store::FSFolder->new( 
        path => '/path/to/index', 
    );
    my $lock_factory = Lucy::Store::LockFactory->new(
        folder => $folder,
        host   => $hostname,
    );
    my $write_lock = $lock_factory->make_lock(
        name     => 'write',
        timeout  => 5000,
        interval => 100,
    );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

LockFactory is used to spin off interprocess mutex locks used by various
index reading and writing components.  The default implementation uses
lockfiles, but LockFactory subclasses which are implemented using
alternatives such as flock() are possible.

=head1 CONSTRUCTORS

=head2 new

    my $lock_factory = Lucy::Store::LockFactory->new(
        folder => $folder,      # required
        host   => $hostname,    # required
    );

Create a new LockFactory.

=over

=item *

B<folder> - A L<Folder|Lucy::Store::Folder>.

=item *

B<host> - An identifier which should be unique per-machine.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 make_lock

    my $lock = $lock_factory->make_lock(
        name     => $name,      # required
        timeout  => $timeout,   # default: 0
        interval => $interval,  # default: 100
    );

Return a Lock object, which, once L<obtain()|Lucy::Store::Lock/obtain> returns successfully,
maintains an exclusive lock on a resource.

=over

=item *

B<name> - A file-system-friendly id which identifies the
resource to be locked.

=item *

B<timeout> - Time in milliseconds to keep retrying before abandoning
the attempt to L<obtain()|Lucy::Store::Lock/obtain> a lock.

=item *

B<interval> - Time in milliseconds between retries.

=back

=head2 make_shared_lock

    my $lock = $lock_factory->make_shared_lock(
        name     => $name,      # required
        timeout  => $timeout,   # default: 0
        interval => $interval,  # default: 100
    );

Return a Lock object for which L<shared()|Lucy::Store::Lock/shared> returns true, and which
maintains a non-exclusive lock on a resource once L<obtain()|Lucy::Store::Lock/obtain> returns
success.

=over

=item *

B<name> - A file-system-friendly id which identifies the
resource to be locked.

=item *

B<timeout> - Time in milliseconds to keep retrying before abandoning
the attempt to L<obtain()|Lucy::Store::Lock/obtain> a lock.

=item *

B<interval> - Time in milliseconds between retries.
