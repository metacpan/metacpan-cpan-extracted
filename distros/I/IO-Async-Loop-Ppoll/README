NAME
    `IO::Async::Loop::Ppoll' - use `IO::Async' with `ppoll(2)'

SYNOPSIS
     use IO::Async::Loop::Ppoll;

     my $loop = IO::Async::Loop::Ppoll->new();

     $loop->add( ... );

     $loop->add( IO::Async::Signal->new(
           name =< 'HUP',
           on_receipt => sub { ... },
     ) );

     $loop->loop_forever();

DESCRIPTION
    This subclass of `IO::Async::Loop::Poll' uses an `IO::Ppoll' object
    instead of a `IO::Poll' to perform read-ready and write-ready tests so
    that they can be mixed with signal handling.

    The `ppoll()' system call atomically switches the process's signal mask,
    performs a wait exactly as `poll()' would, then switches it back. This
    allows a process to block the signals it cares about, but switch in an
    empty signal mask during the poll, allowing it to handle file IO and
    signals concurrently.

CONSTRUCTOR
  $loop = IO::Async::Loop::Ppoll->new( %args )
    This function returns a new instance of a `IO::Async::Loop::Ppoll'
    object. It takes the following named arguments:

    `poll'  The `IO::Ppoll' object to use for notification. Optional; if a
            value is not given, a new `IO::Ppoll' object will be
            constructed.

METHODS
    As this is a subclass of IO::Async::Loop::Poll, all of its methods are
    inherited. Expect where noted below, all of the class's methods behave
    identically to `IO::Async::Loop::Poll'.

  $count = $loop->loop_once( $timeout )
    This method calls the `poll()' method on the stored `IO::Ppoll' object,
    passing in the value of `$timeout', and processes the results of that
    call. It returns the total number of `IO::Async::Notifier' callbacks
    invoked, or `undef' if the underlying `poll()' method returned an error.
    If the `poll()' was interrupted by a signal, then 0 is returned instead.
