    Net::Whois::Raw - Get Whois information for domains
 
SYNOPSIS
      use Net::Whois::Raw;
      
  $dominfo = whois('perl.com');
      ($dominfo, $whois_server) = whois('funet.fi');
      $reginfo = whois('REGRU-REG-RIPN', 'whois.ripn.net');

      $arrayref = get_whois('yahoo.co.uk', undef, 'QRY_ALL');
      $text = get_whois('yahoo.co.uk', undef, 'QRY_LAST');
      ($text, $srv) = get_whois('yahoo.co.uk', undef, 'QRY_FIRST');

      $Net::Whois::Raw::OMIT_MSG = 1;
            # This will attempt to strip several known copyright
            # messages and disclaimers sorted by servers.
            # Default is to give the whole response.

      $Net::Whois::Raw::CHECK_FAIL = 1;
            # This will return undef if the response matches
            # one of the known patterns for a failed search,
            # sorted by servers.
            # Default is to give the textual response.

      $Net::Whois::Raw::CHECK_EXCEED = 1;
            # When this option is set, "die" will be called
            # if connection rate to specific whois server have been
            # exceeded

      $Net::Whois::Raw::CACHE_DIR = "/var/spool/pwhois/";
            # Whois information will be
            # cached in this directory. Default is no cache.

      $Net::Whois::Raw::CACHE_TIME = 60;
            # Cache files will be cleared after not accessed
            # for a specific number of minutes. Documents will not be
            # cleared if they keep get requested for, independent
            # of disk space.

      $Net::Whois::Raw::TIMEOUT = 10;

            # List of local IP addresses to
            # use for WHOIS queries. Addresses will be used used
            # successively in the successive queries

      $Net::Whois::Raw::POSTPROCESS{whois.crsnic.net} = \&my_func;
            # Call to a user-defined subroutine on whois result,
            # depending on whois-server.
            # Above is equil to:
            # ($text, $srv) = whois('example.com');
            # $text = my_func($text) if $srv eq 'whois.crsnic.net';

DESCRIPTION
    Net::Whois::Raw queries WHOIS servers about domains. The module supports
    recursive WHOIS queries. Also queries via HTTP is supported for some
    TLDs.

    Setting the variables $OMIT_MSG and $CHECK_FAIL will match the results
    against a set of known patterns. The first flag will try to omit the
    copyright message/disclaimer, the second will attempt to determine if
    the search failed and return undef in such a case.

    IMPORTANT: these checks merely use pattern matching; they will work on
    several servers but certainly not on all of them.

FUNCTIONS
    whois( DOMAIN [, SRV [, WHICH_WHOIS]] )
       Returns Whois information for "DOMAIN". Without "SRV" argument
       default Whois server for specified domain name zone will be used. Use
       'www_whois' as server name to force WHOIS querying via HTTP (only few
       TLDs are supported in HTTP queries). Caching is supported: if
       $CACHE_DIR variable is set and there is cached entry for that domain
       - information from the cache will be used. "WHICH_WHOIS" argument -
       look get_whois docs below.

    get_whois( DOMAIN [, SRV [, WHICH_WHOIS]] )
       Lower-level function to query Whois information for "DOMAIN". Caching
       IS NOT supported (caching is implemented only in higher-level "whois"
       function). Without "SRV" argument default Whois server for specified
       domain name zone will be used. "WHICH_WHOIS" argument is used to
       access a results if recursive queries; possible values:

       'QRY_FIRST' - returns results of the first query. Non't make
       recursive queries. In scalar context returns just whois text. In list
       context returns two values: whois text and whois server which was
       used to make query).

       'QRY_LAST' - returns results of the last query. In scalar context
       returns just whois text. In list context returns two values: whois
       text and whois server which was used to make query). This is the
       default option.

       'QRY_ALL' - returns results of the all queries of the recursive
       chain. Reference to array of references to hashes is returned. Hash
       keys: "text" - result of whois query, "srv" - whois server which was
       used to make query.

USER DEFINED FUNCTIONS
    whois_query_sockparams( DOMAIN, SRV )
       You can set your own IO::Socket::INET params like this:

           *Net::Whois::Raw::whois_query_sockparams = sub {
               my $class  = shift;
               my $domain = shift;
               my $name   = shift;

               return (
                   PeerAddr => $name,
                   PeerPort => 43,
                   # LocalHost => ,
                   # LocalPort =>
               );
           };

    whois_query_socket( DOMAIN, SRV )
       You can set your own IO::Socket::INET like this:

           *Net::Whois::Raw::whois_query_socket = sub {
               my $class  = shift;
               my $domain = shift;
               my $name   = shift;

               $name .= ':43';
               return IO::Socket::INET->new();
           };

    whois_query_ua( DOMAIN, SRV )
       You can set your own LWP::UserAgent like this:

           *Net::Whois::Raw::whois_query_ua = sub {
               my $class  = shift;
               my $domain = shift;

               return LWP::UserAgent->new();
           };
