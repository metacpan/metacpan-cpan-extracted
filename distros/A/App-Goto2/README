NAME
    App::Goto2 - Easily SSH to many servers

SYNOPSIS
      use App::Goto2;

DESCRIPTION
    App::Goto2 is intended to take the strain out of having a large number
    of servers you frequently have to access via SSH. It allows you to set
    up nicknames, use partial hostnames, and auto-detect available AWS EC2
    instances and work out which one(s) you actually want. It also allows
    for iterating over a number of machines one after the other, and the
    specification of an optional command to be run on the remote machine(s).

    Written by somebody who frequently had to SSH to a vast number of
    machines in multiple domains, with SSH running on numerous ports, with a
    variety of usernames, using a variety of SSH keys; and got sick of
    trying to remember all the details when writing for loops to remotely
    execute commands on them all.

    You can get a lot of the same functionality (port/user/aliases/etc) just
    by updating your ssh config file, but (a) it's harder to share a config
    file, (b) it wouldn't have the EC2 integration and (c) it doesn't lend
    itself to wildcards so well.

  CONFIG
    By default, the config file will be looked for in ~/.go2/config.yml

    An example layout:

     ---
     hosts:
       foo:
         hostname: fubar.example.com
         user: myname
         port: 2222
       bar:
         hostname: bar.example.com
         user: myothername
     aws:
       AWSAccessKeyId: ASDFGHJKLZXCVBNMQWER
       SecretAccessKey: kmj5jgGg7gGKJkqkohknKJHkzhk7hKJHLJKt6tw
       region: eu-west-1
       domain: .example.com
